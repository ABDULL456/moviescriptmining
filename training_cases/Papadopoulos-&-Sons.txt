1   EXT. PAPADOPOULOS MANSION - GARDEN. DAY 1.                   1 
A very English scene - a beautiful English garden belonging to a mansion house. A smartly turned out gardener in green overalls is raking leaves. It's an impressive picture of Britishness and order. Another gardener, DAVE is trimming the edge of the lawn. We see shots of the garden; plants, trees, a gazebo, sundial, water fountain etc. We follow one of the gardeners pushing a wheelbarrow across the width of the lawn and we see the rear of this impressive property.

MRS PARRINGTON knocks on a bedroom door. The door opens on HARRY PAPADOPOULOS in his bedroom doing up his shirt in a mirror.

A chauffeur-driven Mercedes pulls up to the front of the mansion house. MRS PARRINGTON, the housekeeper and nanny, waits for the car. HARRY and his children, JAMES, KATIE and THEO exit through the front door. As they do so, MRS PARRINGTON makes sure the children are smartly turned out. The chauffeur gets out and opens the door for the children. CUT TO: 
4   EXT. CAR MONTAGE. DAY 1.                                     4 
We see the car make its way through London and images of the City, the Gherkin, NatWest Tower, Canary Wharf. The Mercedes pulls up outside a hotel.

5   INT. LONDON HOTEL - AWARDS CEREMONY. DAY 1.                  5 
A PRESENTER is standing behind a lectern, with a large crystal vase award. Behind him, on the stage, we see a 'European Entrepreneur of the Year Award' banner. 
PRESENTER Orphaned when he was just a boy, Harry Papadopoulos came to this country with nothing.

We cut to the family seated at a round table. The children look bored. HARRY listens proudly. 
PRESENTER (CONT'D) Harry was a grafter, entering the restaurant trade as a young man. (Beat) That's a euphemism for 'Greek waiter' isn't it? 
There is some laughter in the audience. We cut to HARRY again, who attempts to smile off the joke. 
PRESENTER (CONT'D) Only joking Harry. He then started the now famous Papadopoulos & Sons - doing all things Greek. From taramasalata to olive oil and frozen mousakas - which, I must admit, my wife and I are partial to occasionally. Not one to settle, Harry's made the move into commercial property where he's about to embark on one of the most audacious developments yet - Papadopoulos Plaza. A two million square foot redevelopment in the heart of our great city. (Applause from the audience) Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you European Entrepreneur of the Year. Harry Papadopoulos. 
Awards music. We now cut to HARRY getting up from the table. He momentarily acknowledges the applause. The children are clapping politely but absently.

DAVE Oh no. Best not. Got some dinner at home. That's a nice vase, isn't it? 
HARRY European Entrepreneur of the Year. 
DAVE That's impressive. 
JAMES Dave. Did you g.. g.. get my cuttings? 
DAVE I did mate. It's in the greenhouse. I got you a Caryopteris and a Philadelphus. JAMES Cheers man. Thank you. 
DAVE See you later. 
JAMES See you tomorrow. 
Dave exits. 
THEO Daddy? What did Papadopoulos & Sons borrow for the property development? 
HARRY About three hundred million. 
MRS PARRINGTON shuts and removes THEO's laptop.

MRS PARRINGTON Never mind the trials and tribulations of the stock market. Finish your supper young man. 
THEO Nanny P! 
MRS PARRINGTON Eat up or there'll be no pudding. I've made you a nice sponge. 
THEO pulls a childish grimace and starts to breath heavily through his nose. 
THEO Two, Four, Eight, 16... 
HARRY Alright. 
THEO Thirty two, sixty four, 128.. 
HARRY That's enough. 
THEO Something is happening with interbank lending Daddy! 
HARRY Alright. We'll talk about it tomorrow. 
HARRY gets up from the table. HARRY (CONT'D) It's going to be a long summer. 
HARRY exits. 
MRS PARRINGTON Taking them to a business awards ceremony is hardly a family day out. My suggestion was a cottage in Lyme Regis.

8   INT. PAPADOPOULOS MANSION - HALLWAY. EVENING 1.              8 
DAVE is at the front door in the hallway. He is putting on his muddy boots. HARRY enters. 
JAMES' room resembles a botanical garden. JAMES is at his desk with pots of plants and various tools and test tubes with soil and desk lamps. JAMES looks through a microscope, studying a leaf, ignoring his father. HARRY surveys the room trying to accommodate his son's interest in botany. He notices a poster of Charles Darwin with a quote. He reads it out. 
HARRY(CONT'D) It is not the strongest to survive, nor the most intelligent but those adaptable to change. Fascinating. Charles Darwin. (Latching onto a random plant) Ah. Look at that. (Beat) And that's... 
JAMES answers without looking up from the microscope. 
JAMES Did you know, that the average garden contains over three and a half million species? 
HARRY No, I didn't. 
JAMES Dad. I'm not going back to...

HARRY But it's only a year and then you've got a law degree. 
JAMES I've no intention of running P.. P.. Papadopoulos & Sons. I can't even pronounce it. 
HARRY Look. Finish your studies. The plants. It's a hobby. Sure. Give yourself options. You may change your mind about the business. You know, there are a lot of creative roles now in business. 
JAMES Like what? 
HARRY Like marketing. Alright. Defer the final year. Take a year out, why not? Fine. But don't quit. Your mother would have said the same. 
JAMES Would she? 
HARRY Well, your mother would probably have said do what you feel was right but I'd argue she was wrong. And then we'd argue. Probably. And she'd win. That was your mother. At least consider deferring. JAMES thinks about it. 
JAMES Okay. I'll consider deferring. 
HARRY Yeah? Great. Great. So, there you are, it's not a definitely not? 
HARRY wants to bond but doesn't know where to start. HARRY latches onto an English Ivy in a Union Jack plant pot. 
HARRY (CONT'D) What's this one called? 
JAMES It's an ivy. 
The doorbell rings.

HARRY Mrs P!(Pause, waits for a response) Mrs P! Look, I'd better. 
HARRY goes to exit and then comes back to shake his son's hand. 
HARRY (CONT'D) Hey. Well done. For. You know. 
HARRY heads towards the door and just before he exits he gives an emphatic double thumbs up. 
HARRY CONT Closed? 
JAMES Yes please. 
HARRY I'm not going to say that word. 
DOOR KNOCKER Why not? 
HARRY Because it's a silly word and I don't know what it's for and I don't know if you're genuine. And I'll probably never use it.

HARRY walks in with the entire box of cleaning products and hands them to MRS PARRINGTON. 
MRS PARRINGTON Oh. A shammy. 
THEO Come look Daddy. 
On the TV, we see a 'New Bank Crisis?' banner and a reporter standing outside a bank in the city of London. 
HARRY Turn it up. THEO points the remote and turns up the volume. 
NEWS REPORTER Panic confusion and chaos. They said it couldn't happen again but today it just did sending shock waves through the world's markets. 
HARRY What's going on? 
THEO Another bank collapse. 
The TV images cut to people leaving an office with boxes of their belongings. 
NEWS REPORTER VO (CONT) All 8,000 members of staff have been asked to leave while the bank is put into liquidation. (MORE) (CONTINUED)

HARRY's mobile phone rings. He answers. 
HARRY Nicholas. I'm watching now. It's insane. I don't know. Why don't you call them? Alright. I'll see you first thing tomorrow. Bye. 
THEO Will this have repercussions on your loan? 
Harry is lost in thought. 
MRS PARRINGTON That's a very good word Theo. Isn't it? Daddy? Repercussions. (Beat) It's a good word. 
HARRY Oh yes. Sorry. Yes. It's a very good word.

HARRY, FAT LAKI and NICHOLAS are walking into the office. 
FAT LAKI They've revalued the property. They're calling in the guarantees. You need to find thirty mil now. Six months to find the rest. 
HARRY And if we don't? What happens? 
ROB Put something offshore, I said. He wanted to pay his taxes. 
HARRY Maybe I should have been more Greek about it. 
ROB Hey. It's bankruptcy baby. Not disaster.

HARRY Accountants. When it's good, they get paid. When it's bad, they get paid. I want my son to be a lawyer for the same reason. He doesn't get it. So what are the options? 
ROB Well, the obvious is to buy back your own business. 
SOPHIE Trick is finding the investors to back you. 
HARRY And the banks will sell back to me because? 
ROB Because nobody makes pink slop like you do Harry. 
SOPHIE The banks just want a quick sale. They have no interest in running your business. 
HARRY Let's jump on it. 
ROB I'll talk to private equity firms, VCs, angels. The usual suspects. We'll find someone. SOPHIE What doesn't break you, makes you. 
HARRY Ah. Therapy. Don't charge me for that, will you? Rob? Don't let her charge me for that.

Music continues. We see the front of the house. A standard removal truck is parked outside alongside the Mercedes and a Bentley sports car - displaying (PAPA 1 and PAPA 2 number plates). Two removal men in white overalls and white gloves (almost forensic looking) walk out the front door carrying a large oil painting. A third man stands at the back of the van waiting to receive goods.

The family, including MRS PARRINGTON, are in the kitchen. THEO is on his laptop. KATIE nervously files her nails. MRS PARRINGTON has made everyone a cup of tea. HARRY is reading a newspaper. JAMES is reading a book. KATIE enters. 
KATIE They're going through my things. It's disgusting. 
HARRY Are they darling. It's temporary. You'll get it all back. 
Two bank assessors RUPERT and NIGEL enter. RUPERT has a clipboard with items to be ticked off. NIGEL has a camera. RUPERT Morning. 
THEO Brilliant! KATIE Is he talking about us? 
JAMES Yeah, I think he is. 
HARRY There's nothing there. 
SPIROS Exactly. It's empty. Useless. We'd get nothing for it. But if we made the Three Brothers great again. Hey! That is our destiny! Okay. It needs work. Sure. But destiny need work. 
HARRY You're still crazy.

SPIROS We have. You. You have a better chance of getting through this if we increase the value of the shop. 
HARRY I'm not opening a fish and chip shop, I'm Papadopoulos & Sons, I'm on supermarket shelves. 
KATIE God. What would I tell my friends? 
JAMES Don't know, maybe the truth? 
KATIE (Mimicking) I don't know, maybe the truth. 
JAMES God. Fuck off. 
KATIE F.. f.. fuck you. 
MRS PARRINGTON Enough! 
SPIROS People! Hear me out. If we get it up and running again, we can sell it as a going concern instead of an empty shop. This deal you're working on could take ages. In the meantime, you're getting cash in and you're saving money because it's got two bedrooms. Eh? The Three Brothers is a goldmine. Used to be. Can be again. 
HARRY When did you become so practical? 
SPIROS I'll get it fixed. I'm a handyman now. 
MRS PARRINGTON I thought you were a waiter Spiros. 
SPIROS Around too much booze Mrs P. I went travelling. Belgium, America, Brooklyn. I ended up managing a block of apartments in LA. I do painting, decorating, plumbing, electrics, everything.

SPIROS I've got a van. 
HARRY Oh. It's alright everyone. Don't panic. He's got a van. 
SPIROS Let's go look at the shop. Let me go and start working on it now. 
HARRY You're out of your mind. I know what you're up to. You want to make some money for yourself. That's fine. It's okay. It's okay. At least you're thinking smart these days. But don't involve us in all this. 
SPIROS I want to help. 
MRS PARRINGTON Given the current situation, I think it's worth consideration. 
SPIROS, HARRY, JAMES and THEO walk up a steel staircase onto the Three Brother's roof terrace. 
SPIROS Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey. Remember up here? We used to bring out the tables and chairs with the other Greeks. (MORE) (CONTINUED)

THEO Did my Daddy dance? 
SPIROS Yeah. I taught him. And your mother. 
THEO My Mummy? 
SPIROS Hey. Manga. This is the place where your Mummy and Daddy met. 
JAMES What? Up here? 
SPIROS Yeah. They talked all night. They danced. Yeah, there was a lot of dancing here. Hey. You want me to show you? How about it? 
SPIROS clicks his fingers. 
HARRY Spiros please. It's not a holiday. Just show everyone around. 
HARRY exits. 
SPIROS What? (To THEO) I'll show you later. (To JAMES) You alright? 
JAMES Yeah. No, I like the view. I might put some plants up here.

KATIE hands him a lighter. 
MEHMET I'm from the kebab shop across the road. 
KATIE Nice. 
Silence. MEHMET's run out things to say. They both smoke. 
MEHMET My Dad wants me to spy on you. I don't think he like Greeks. (More silence) You want to go out sometime? 
KATIE Yeah, alright. 
MEHMET I'm Mehmet. 
HARRY But? 
ROB Money isn't cheap Harry. These guys will want at least 95% of the company. 
HARRY Leaving me with nothing. I'd do the same thing. I'd be CEO of Papadopoulos & Sons. Get a salary. Get my house back. My children's future. 
ROB It beats fish and chips. 
SOPHIE You'd be working for someone else. 
HARRY I'd be working for someone else. By the way, I'm not actually running a fish and chip shop. Just helping my brother relaunch. ROB Sure. Listen, there maybe another way. Came up in conversation with the Norske Velconan Bank. It'd be along the lines of a straight loan to buy back the business. 
HARRY Why would they lend me the money? 
ROB Well. Let's ask them. Want me to look into it? 
HARRY Sure, no choice. 
ROB's mobile alarm goes off.

(ROB holds up a flyer for the company) An internet ready, wireless, crapper with a waterproof keyboard and screen. For the love of God. Because taking a dump needed an overhaul. Still, somebody's got to bury them. Inomine patre, Spiritu, Sanctu... etc, etc. 
SOPHIE Got to love a downturn. 
ROB Laters. 
ROB exits. SOPHIE starts to pack her files. 
SOPHIE I think what you're currently doing with your brother sounds liberating. 
HARRY I'm liberating myself of my last 25 grand on a disused chip shop. 
SOPHIE But its like a startup. Isn't that the most exciting phase of any venture? Taking a bit of a risk. Developing your products and your services. Learning about your market. Look, some of the largest companies on the planet never make a profit. Like a real profit. It's all accounting tricks and leveraged debt. What I'm trying to say is, does it matter if the business is a small one? As long as it makes a profit and the people who work there are happy? 
HARRY What are you doing working in a place like this? 
SOPHIE This is only temporary. I got divorced recently. Came to London for a fresh start. I'm actually looking into setting up my own business. 
HARRY Well, I'm sorry about that. About the divorce, I mean. Not...

HARRY There isn't one. 
SOPHIE When it's up and running. 
HARRY It's a chip shop. It's hot. On your feet all hours. Verbal abuse from customers on a Friday night. 
SOPHIE I wasn't applying for a job Harry. Just wanted to stop by. 
KATIE and JAMES tickle THEO who squeals with delight. SPIROS laughs.

SPIROS Ah, your kids are something else. 
SPIROS undresses, taking off items of clothes until he is down to his boxer shorts. SPIROS then gets out an icon of the Virgin Mary. He kisses it and then crosses himself three times. 
SPIROS (CONT'D) Don't worry. I'm not too religious. I'm a lapsed Buddhist. I do everything a good Buddhist does except abstinence. 
SPIROS farts. Harry shuts his eyes and shakes his head in disgust. SPIROS then hands HARRY some ear plugs. 
SPIROS (CONT'D) Ear plugs. 
SPIROS gets into the sleeping bag and turns off the light. 
SPIROS (CONT'D) Oi re. This is a fantastic thing. Did you ever imagine, 30 years ago? Back here? HARRY No. 
SPIROS Remember how excited we felt when we got this place? It feels like that again. Hey. My gut says... push Alaskan Pollock. Over Cod! What do you think? 
HARRY I should never have taken out that loan. 
SPIROS Ah. We'll talk fish after we fix this place. (Singing) We'll talk fish after we fix this place. Katie's got some good thoughts. Says we should keep the old look. And she had some beautiful ideas about the uniforms. (CONTINUED)

We see FAT LAKI, PHIL THE TILL, FATHER JIMMY, a Greek Orthodox priest and an assortment of Greek faces of various ages. 
SPIROS We were children when we came to the UK with nothing. We start again. Fat Laki. The weight you lost is an inspiration. Phil The Till. You've helped many Greeks with your tax friendly till machines. Eh, only two things are certain in life - death and taxes. Unless you're Greek. Then it's only death! (The crowd cheer). Nikos, Kyriaco, Androniki, Loula, Uncle Panikos, Aphrodite, Maria and of course, Father Jimmy. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

KATIE What? We're going out. 
MRS PARRINGTON Not too late. 
KATIE exits with MEHMET. 
MRS PARRINGTON (CONT'D) Well, she is 18. 
HARRY We'll make a better product at a cheaper price with larger portions. We'll lose money on the kebabs in the short term, put Turks out of business within a year, make our margins on the fish and when the rest of this crummy street has packed up we'll raise our prices and cut our portion sizes. 
SPIROS The entrepreneur has spoken. 
HARRY Hey, it's temporary, but as long as we're here we'll do some business.

SPIROS Yeah. 
HARRY Dropped me down. I was just a baby. 
SPIROS I caught him. But Michael... He. I told Mihalis to jump. But he... he ran right back into the house. We'll never know why. One night and everything changes. 
JAMES He probably wanted to save his Mum and Dad. 
SPIROS You know what? I never thought about that. You could be right. Yeah. You are a wise boy James. Your soul is old. Tell me. This has always been a big question for me. For many years. Do you think... do you think... I could've done something else? For Michael? 
JAMES No. You were holding a baby. 
SPIROS Yeah. 
JAMES I can grow new ones. 
HARRY Why didn't you bring more with you? 
JAMES I didn't want to get in the way. 
HARRY You're such a sweet boy. You get that from your mother. Your stammer is getting better. You know what? I'm going to go and get your plants. Now. From the house.

SPIROS It doesn't sound very good. 
HARRY Hey. You can stay up. It's the holidays. Tomorrow, we'll look through the newspapers and pick out some stocks. How does that grab you? 
THEO Natural resources is a good buy. 
KATIE Hey, wait. Show us your frying skills.

Harry is chocked and is trying to hold it together. 
HARRY I'm sorry, I can't. 
SPIROS It's okay H. 
HARRY I've got to get to this meeting. It's an important meeting. 
SPIROS It's okay to miss her. 
HARRY Oh man. (Silence) Just give me a minute.

47   EXT. INDUSTRIAL ESTATE. DAY 10.                             47 
We see Spiros' solitary van parked up in ghostly industrial estate. The van eventually starts and pulls away. CUT TO: 
48   INT. MORTIMER, ROLF & JONES - BOARD ROOM. DAY 10.           48 
SOPHIE, ROB, HARRY and LARS - a Scandinavian banker - are sitting round the boardroom table. 
ROB With the help of Lars and the Norske Velconan Bank, we aim to buy Pap and Sons back from the receivers. 
LARS Also, I have to say Harry that I believe there is an intuitive bond between the Greek and the Nordic peoples, yah? And so, maybe the very first vikings were descended from Ancient Greeks, somewhere in the deep mists of time. And so it's so... so Wagnerian, yah? (CONTINUED) 
48   CONTINUED:                                                48 
SOPHIE We should point out the new approach. 
ROB To buy Papadopoulos & Sons but divest the food manufacturing side of the business. 
HARRY Divest the food manufacturing? What else is there? 
ROB Sell off the food but keep the property. 
LARS Papadopoulos Plaza. It's going to be worth a fortune. 
HARRY That's not what I had in mind. 
SOPHIE It's an asset breakup. 
LARS Tusk. Tusk, yah? Makes us sound like barbarians. 
ROB With the new loan, you'd buy back your old assets and then sell off the brands in the Pap & Sons stable. 
LARS Yah. And you know how to squeeze the value Harry. 
SOPHIE That's a break up. 
HARRY Please. I know what it is. 
LARS The pitta bread, the cakes get sold to a bakery. 
ROB The halloumi and feta to a dairy company. 
LARS I love your halloumi! Grilled. It's... (Kisses air) 
SOPHIE Okay. Let's grab a coffee. 
CUT TO: 
50   EXT. SOUTH BANK. DAY 10.                                    50 
SOPHIE and HARRY are strolling along London's South Bank. 
(CONTINUED) 
50   CONTINUED:                                                50 
SOPHIE So it's 30% on materials. The fish, the potatoes, the packaging etc. Would you include energy? Light, heat? 
HARRY Yeah. But not rent because we already own the building. 
SOPHIE Okay. And 30% on labour? 
HARRY Yeah. 
SOPHIE So it's 30/30/30. Classic restaurant model. 
HARRY That's right. 
SOPHIE What are your weaknesses? 
HARRY The price of fish can vary. Dramatically. 
SOPHIE Can you vary the menu? 
HARRY You don't want to complicate it. 
SOPHIE It doesn't have to be complicated Harry. (Beat) What are your fears? 
HARRY My fears? Oh. Just that it just won't work out. That fish and chips has maybe had its day. 
SOPHIE No. Hang on a second. (They stop) Fish and chips is a British classic. It's much more than just a quick meaningless experience. It's something to be savoured. Just think of the soft, white, cod flakes, gently falling away as your fork pierces the hard, crunchy shell of the golden batter. The rich smells of a fryer's delight. The tangy smack of salt and vinegar on your lips. Hell yeah. I'd pay for that. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
50   CONTINUED: (2)                                            50 SOPHIE (CONT'D) (HARRY and SOPHIE exchange glances. They hold a look) We should talk about... We should talk about accounting packages. 
HARRY Yes. We should 
We see HARRY and SOPHIE walk down South Bank. 
CUT TO: 
51   EXT. LOCAL PARK. BRIDGE. DAY 10.                          51 
MEHMET and KATIE are kissing on a bridge. KATIE breaks away and stares into the distance. 
MEHMET What? 
KATIE This time last year I was in Malibu. 
MEHMET We'll go tonight. 
KATIE It's not a nightclub. It's America. 
HASSAN Remember when we were children? When we were friends. We weren't Greeks, Turks. Respectfully, I would like you to take your kebabs off the menu. This is a fish and chip shop. 
SPIROS What do we get? 
HASSAN I won't do fish. 
HARRY You don't do fish Hassan. HASSAN You are going to put us on the street. 
HARRY It's business. 
HASSAN It's not about business. Perhaps you would not be like this if we were Greeks. 
HARRY I'll tell you what. We'll take kebabs off the menu, if you ask your son to stay away from my daughter. 
HASSAN thinks about this. He sips his tea. 
SPIROS More tea? 
(CONTINUED) 
54   CONTINUED:                                                54 
HASSAN No. Thank you. This is very difficult. 
HARRY Come on. It's easy. 
HASSAN My son is his own man. 
HARRY Right. There's no deal. 
HASSAN Is this because he's Turkish? Because he's a Muslim? 
HARRY Oh no. I don't have a problem with that. 
SPIROS Harry's not like that. 
HASSAN Because he works in a kebab shop? Is that it? 
SPIROS Yeah. Harry's more like that. 
HARRY I would ask you - both of you - to respect a man's aspiration for his daughter. HASSAN I have similar aspirations for my son. Spiro, perhaps you should remind your brother where he is now. Tell him to look around. Perhaps he still sees a big mansion with gardens and servants. Well, I don't. But more importantly, neither does my son. 
HARRY This is only. We'll be gone in a couple of months. 
HASSAN I hope so. It's going to be a very long couple of months. 
HARRY For both of us. 
(CONTINUED) 
54   CONTINUED: (2)                                            54 
HASSAN finishes his tea. There is an uncomfortable silence. At this moment THEO comes in with a camera and takes a photo of the three men sitting together. 
THEO Say cheese! 
Flash. The scene of the three men is captured as a still photograph. Music - 5000 Lies by George Zambetas. 
THEO Will we get to visit Uncle Spiros again? 
MRS PARRINGTON Yes, of course we will. 
SPIROS Who's going to help me to run the store? I'm going to need you little man. 
MRS PARRINGTON I expect Uncle Spiros will always find you a holiday job here. (CONTINUED) 
56   CONTINUED:                                                56 
The mobile phone rings. HARRY answers. 
HARRY Hello. Lars. Yeah. I'm just... 
HARRY steps away from the table and exits the restaurant area. We watch the family. They do not talk. HARRY comes back. 
MRS PARRINGTON What is it? 
THEO Did you get the loan? 
HARRY Bad news I'm afraid. 
KATIE Really? 
HARRY Yeah. We're going home! We got it! We're going home. 
The family's response is muted. 
SPIROS Congratulations. 
HARRY What's wrong? We're leaving, we're out of here. We got the loan. We should be celebrating. 
The family are still unmoved. SPIROS He's right. It's a good day. You, you made it. You're a survivor. Sorry. 
SPIROS shows some discomfort and starts to get up. 
HARRY What is it with you Spiro? Why can't you be happy for me? Whenever I have any kind success you always have to stamp on it. (Spiros gets up) Where are you going? 
SPIROS I am happy for you. I am. 
HARRY What is it? What's wrong? 
Spiros staggers off. 
(CONTINUED) 
56   CONTINUED: (2)                                            56

SPIROS is on an oxygen mask. HARRY, KATIE, JAMES, THEO and MRS PARRINGTON are watching him. 
The family depart. SOPHIE also goes to leave. 
HARRY Would you mind staying around? 
SOPHIE Of course.

CUT TO: 
59   INT. HOSPITAL. EVENING 13.                                  59 
HARRY and SOPHIE sit at SPIROS' side. It is late. HARRY is gently singing Varka Sto Gialo (A Boat in the Harbour) to SPIROS - a traditional Greek song. He is humming the parts he cannot remember. 
HARRY So, he saved me twice. Once in the fire, and once after the banks. I was always embarrassed by him, you know. By his thing that he does. You know, his... 'thing'. But the thing that he does. It's a good thing really. These last few months. This year actually. This whole year. God. What a year. What a year. And yet. I've never felt so alive. I've never felt so engaged. Why is that? I mean why? I mean, I'm frying chips. 
SOPHIE shrugs with smile. 
HARRY (CONT'D) I love him. I've always loved him. And I love my children. I love... I love my life. I love it. Why is that? Why do I love it now? What was wrong with it before? 
SOPHIE It's okay. It's okay. 
HARRY It's a crazy, crazy, world. It's up, it's down. You fight. You win. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
59   CONTINUED:                                                59 HARRY (CONT'D) You lose. You become exhausted. And then you leave. There's no logic. There's no logic. It's insane. It's insane. The whole thing. 
SPIROS wakes. He rips out the respirator from his mouth. 
HARRY (CONT'D) No, no, no, no. Spiro. 
SOPHIE I'll get someone. 
SOHPIE exits. 
HARRY Spiro mou. Spiro mou. 
SPIROS Ella bethi mou. Ella tho. You have to let me go. It's good. Michael's with us. Michael. O Mihalis. He was always there. Always with us. Always. Three brothers. 
HARRY When I was a little boy. You cooked for me. Every time I came home. They were good times Spiro. Efharisto. 
SPIROS Itan Kali zoi. A good life. Now you understand. Levendis mou. 
SPIROS smiles. He closes his eyes and dies. CUT TO: 
60   INT. THE THREE BROTHERS - RESTAURANT AREA. DAY 14.          60 
Fade from black. Music continues. Close up on HARRY who is sitting by himself. He has just come from the funeral and wears black. We see a hand on his shoulder. As the camera tracks back we see it is KATIE's hand. She is also wearing black. He touches it. He is starring into the distance. KATIE sits next to him. JAMES and THEO appear, also in black, and sit next to KATIE. They stare into the distance. The camera continues to track back towards the entrance of the shop. 
CUT TO: 
61   EXT. THE THREE BROTHERS - ROOF TERRACE. DAY 14.             61 
JAMES and HARRY climb up the stairs to the roof terrace. HARRY stops and stares in disbelief. We cut to HARRY's POV and see a beautiful roof garden packed with plants and life. 
64   EXT. LOCAL PARK. DAY 15.                                    64 
HARRY, ROB and SOPHIE are in a park, sitting on a park bench. 
ROB Tell me this is a joke. 
HARRY I don't want to do the deal. ROB Harry, you have seriously lost the plot on this one. 
HARRY It just doesn't feel right. 
ROB We worked hard on this. 
SOPHIE If he doesn't want to do the deal, he doesn't want to do it. 
ROB Shut up. 
HARRY Hey. No need for that. 
ROB I don't understand. (CONTINUED) 
64   CONTINUED:                                                64 
HARRY I've got everything I want.   And I've got no debt. And that feels   good. When I lock up my shop at night,   it feels good. I've got no debts, no   loans. I own it 100 per cent. 
ROB Come on. A percentage of something that could be worth millions. You'd walk away from that? For a chip shop? 
HARRY Yeah. Right now? Yes. I would. And I'm with my children. And that's. You can't put a price on that Rob. And I'm having fun. We're having fun. Come back to the shop and let me cook you something to eat. Go on. We're doing great business. I'm actually thinking of expanding. 
ROB That's... That's... That's good Harry. That's, that's very good. I'm happy for you. If this is success. 
HARRY What is success Rob? What is it? We've both had it. What is it? Is it the share price? Is it the profit earnings ratio? Is it a beautiful car. 
ROB You tell me Harry. You've had it all. 
HARRY Yeah, I have. And I can tell you. Success is... the joy you feel. That's it. That's all it is. Success is the joy you feel! 
ROB Come on. Lets go. 
SOPHIE I don't think so. 
ROB Okay. I'm sorry I shouted at you. 
SOPHIE I don't care about that. I just don't want to work for you anymore. 
Rob shakes his head and walks off. (CONTINUED) 
64   CONTINUED: (2)                                            64 
ROB Good luck people! 
HARRY Best fish and chips in London! 
ROB Call me when you want to go public! 
SOPHIE I just quit my job. 
HARRY Yep. I think you did.

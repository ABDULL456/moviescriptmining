1 EXT. TORONTO RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY 1 
Snowy suburbs of Toronto. From a nondescript house we hear: 
KIM PINE (O.S.) Scott Pilgrim is dating a high schooler? 
2 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' KITCHEN - DAY 2 
Four twenty-somethings lounge around a small kitchen table. STEPHEN STILLS, 25, shaggy hair, Canadian Cowboy chic. 
STEPHEN STILLS Really? Is she hot? KIM PINE, 22, cute, bitter, sweatshirt with a zipper. 
KIM PINE How old are you now, Scott? Like twenty-eight? 
SCOTT I'm not playing your little games. 
KIM PINE So you've been out of high school for like, 13 years and- 
SCOTT (O.S.) I'm twenty-two. Twenty-two! 
STEPHEN STILLS And you're dating a high school girl? Not bad, not bad. YOUNG NEIL, 20, simple mind, layered T-shirts. 
YOUNG NEIL Like, did you guys 'do it' yet? SCOTT PILGRIM, 22, fresh faced and charmingly cocky with an unruly yet adorable mop of hair. 
SCOTT We have done many things. We ride the bus. We have meaningful conversations about how yearbook club went and about her friends and, um...you know...drama. 
STEPHEN STILLS Yeah, okay, have you even kissed her?

KIM PINE Well. Aren't you pleased as punch? 
STEPHEN STILLS So, what's her name? 
SCOTT (pleased as punch) Knives Chau. She's Chinese. 
STEPHEN STILLS (under his breath) Chinese... Young Neil pauses his Nintendo DS. 
YOUNG NEIL Wicked! How'd you meet her? 
SCOTT I believe I mentioned the bus? Scott Pilgrim prepares to tell an amazing story: 
3 INT. THE BUS - NIGHT 3 
KNIVES CHAU, 17, cute and innocent with clothes to match, sits next to her mother, MOTHER CHAU, 45, demanding. 
MOTHER CHAU You are seventeen year old! Time to get interested in boy! 
KNIVES CHAU Mom! Knives DROPS her bag, books scattering everywhere. 
MOTHER CHAU You drop book. Knives crouches down to pick up her books, grumbling. 
SCOTT (O.S.) Hey... Knives looks up to see the cute and gallant SCOTT PILGRIM holding her books. TEXT appears in an on-screen box: 
"SCOTT PILGRIM, 22 YEARS OLD, RATING: AWESOME." Stars appear in Knives's eyes. Scott grins heroically. Scott winks at Knives. Scott winks at the camera.

SCOTT Yes. It is. Young Neil unpauses his Nintendo DS. 
STEPHEN STILLS So when do we get to meet her? 
KIM PINE Oh please. Let it be soon. DINGY DONG! The doorbell rings. Scott smiles broadly. 
SCOTT That's for me. 
5 INT/EXT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - DAY 5 
An eager Knives stands outside. Scott opens the door a crack. 
SCOTT You promise to be good? 
KNIVES CHAU Of course I'll be good! 
SCOTT No, really. Please be good. 
KNIVES CHAU Am I normally not? Stephen Stills comes to the door and peers through. 
SCOTT Yeaaaah... 
9 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - EVENING 9 
Scott hangs his coat up in a tiny, one room apartment. He turns to WALLACE WELLS, dark hair, arched eyebrow, disloyal. 
"WALLACE WELLS, ROOMMATE, 24 YEARS OLD, FUN FACT: HE IS GAY!" 
SCOTT Before you hear some dirty lies from someone else, yes, I'm dating a 17 year old. Wallace looks up from the NOW magazine he's reading. 
WALLACE Is he cute? 
SCOTT Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
WALLACE Does this mean we have to stop sleeping together? 
SCOTT Do you see another bed in here? TINY BOXES OF TEXT indicate the ownership of the items in the one room flat: 95% belongs to Wallace, FUTON included. 
WALLACE Yeah. You're totally my bitch forever. 
SCOTT So. The whole seventeen year old thing. Don't tell too many people.

SCOTT I mean. Don't tell my sister. 
WALLACE You know me. Wallace tosses the NOW magazine aside, starts texting. 
SCOTT Who are you texting? RINGY RING. The phone goes. Scott picks up. 
STACEY (O.S.) Seventeen years old? Scandal! Intercut with STACEY PILGRIM, cute, peppy barista, gabbing on her cellphone in THE SECOND CUP. A sign behind her reads 'If you are using your cellphone, you will not be served'. 
"STACEY PILGRIM, YOUNGER SISTER, 19, RATING: 'T' FOR TEEN." 
SCOTT That's not true. Who told you? 
STACEY Wallace. Duh. 
SCOTT That gossipy bitch. 
WALLACE (O.S.) You know me. Scott turns to see Wallace on a second cordless. 
SCOTT Wallace! Wallace clicks off. Scott sinks into an armchair. 
STACEY Who is this mysterious child you date? 
SCOTT Her name is Knives. Knives Chau. 
STACEY A seventeen year old Chinese schoolgirl? You're ridiculous. 
SCOTT It's a Catholic school too. 
STACEY With the uniform and everything?

SCOTT Yeah, the whole deal. 
STACEY Oh my God, you haven't- 
SCOTT No no no. We haven't even held hands. I think she hugged me once. 
STACEY Um, Scott. Why are you doing this? 
SCOTT I don't know...it's just nice, you know? It's just...simple. 
STACEY It's been over a year since you got dumped by she-who-will-not-be-named. Scott glances down at the partially obscured NOW magazine, looking into the HOT GIRL'S EYES on the back cover album ad. 
STACEY (CONT'D) So, are you legitimately moving on, or is this just you being insane? Scott looks at a strip of photobooth pictures: he smiles next to a hot redhead in happier times. 
SCOTT Can I get back to you on that? A SCHOOL BELL clangs loudly... 
10 EXT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL - DAY 10 
Wallace and Scott stand outside a CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL. Uniformed boys and girls pour out. 
WALLACE I do not want to be here. At all. 
SCOTT This school has boys too. 
WALLACE I hate you. Even I would think twice about dating a seventeen year old. 
SCOTT Well, she's only allowed out when the sun is up, so I wouldn't call it dating, more like...

SCOTT My secret lair is one of those 'no girls allowed' deals. 
KNIVES CHAU Oh, okay. 
SCOTT But do you want to see the house where I grew up? 
KNIVES CHAU Sure. They literally walk across the street to a small house. 
SCOTT Here you go. 
KNIVES CHAU Wow. 
SCOTT Yeah. Wow. Wind blows. The light snowfall turns into sand... 
16 EXT. THE DREAM DESERT - HOTTEST DAY 16 
...Scott wanders alone through a barren land. He falls to his knees next to a lonely cactus. 
SCOTT Oh God...so...so alone. A MYSTERIOUS GIRL rollerblades across the shifting sands. She wears fishnets, an army jacket, skirt and goggles. Her pink hair is funky but cool. She is hotter than the desert sun. 
MYSTERIOUS GIRL You're not alone. You're just having some idiotic dream. 
SCOTT Does that mean we can make out? But she's gone...

"OTHER SCOTT, 22, WALLACE'S BOYFRIEND? FUN FACT: GUY CURIOUS" 
OTHER SCOTT Can we skip the dreamtime? Color me not interested. 
SCOTT But there was this girl... 
WALLACE Girl? 
OTHER SCOTT Was this an Envy related dream? 
WALLACE We don't use the E-word in this house. 
SCOTT No, it wasn't her. It was somebody new... 
OTHER SCOTT Yay for that. Other Scott goes back to sleep. Wallace rubs his eyes. 
WALLACE Speaking of new, weren't you supposed to take your fake high school girlfriend to the library a half-hour ago? 
SCOTT What? It's like, six in the morning. Scott opens the bathroom door. Sunlight ignites the room. 
SCOTT (CONT'D) Arrrrgh!

SCOTT Libraries remind me of grade school. 
KNIVES CHAU That must seem like a reeeeally long time ago. 
SCOTT Uh. Let's talk about something else. The hiss of ball bearings catches Scott's attention. He freezes as he sees THE ROLLERBLADING GIRL FROM HIS DREAM skating towards the desk in SEXALICIOUS SLOW MOTION. 
KNIVES CHAU Do you know that girl? The Rollerblading Girl delivers a package from AMAZON.CA to the librarian. Scott's gaze follows the GIRL as she blades out of the library. Pensive guitar underscores his thoughts. 
KNIVES CHAU Scott? Scott continues to stare at the girl. Time slows to a crawl. 
STEPHEN STILLS (O.S.) 
SCOTT! 
19 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - EVENING 19 
Scott stands in the rehearsal room, head still in the clouds. 
STEPHEN STILLS You only played one note for that entire song. 
SCOTT It was...uh...my hand slipped. 
KIM PINE Is your girlfriend distracting you? 
SCOTT My girlfriend? A meek Knives sits next to Young Neil on the couch. 
KNIVES CHAU I'll... I'll be quieter. 
STEPHEN STILLS Let's do that one again. 
SCOTT 
SHE'S TOTALLY REAL! 
YOUNG NEIL 
WHO!? 
STEPHEN STILLS

MONIQUE I think she has a boyfriend. 
SANDRA Some guy back in New York. 
MONIQUE Doesn't she have the most ridiculous name? 
SANDRA I know. It's so 'Ramona Quimby, Aged 8' and yet...Flowers. The girls laugh. Scott does not. 
SCOTT Yeah. What else? JUMP CUT through a FLURRY OF FACES as Scott asks everyone 
ABOUT RAMONA: 
PARTYGOER #1 I heard she kicks all kind of ass. 
PARTYGOER #2 She's on another level. 
PARTYGOER #3 She's got men dying at her feet. 
PARTYGOER #4 She's got some battle scars. 
PARTYGOER #5 Not to be entered into lightly We end on the surly JULIE (the rude clerk) who steps in front of Scott, arms crossed. Stephen Stills is with her. 
JULIE What about Ramona Flowers? 
SCOTT You know her? Tell me. Now. 
JULIE She just moved here. Got a job with Amazon. Comes into my work.

SCOTT Yeah, I don't know what it is about that girl, she just- 
JULIE Scott, I forbid you from hitting on Ramona. Even if you haven't had a real girlfriend in over a year- 
STEPHEN STILLS Hey whoa, whoa. Scott's mourning period is officially over. He's totally dating a high schooler. 
JULIE Dating a high schooler is the mourning period. 
STEPHEN STILLS She's got a point. 
SCOTT I thought you guys broke up. 
JULIE I don't want you scaring off the coolest girl at my party Scott. We all know you're a total lady killer wannabe jerky jerk. 
SCOTT That's garbage! Completely untrue. 
JULIE That time with Lisa- 
WALLACE It's amazing what they can do with computers these days. 
SCOTT Dude! Now I'm reading it! 
WALLACE I'm so happy for you. 
SCOTT "Dear Mr. Pilgrim, It has come to my attention that we will be fighting soon. My name is Matthew Patel, and I'm" blah blah 'fair warning' blah blah...hmm. This is...this is...THIS IS...!!!

KNIVES CHAU Attack hug! Knives smothers Scott. 
SCOTT Attack hug. That's cute. He plasters on his best fake smile. 
KNIVES CHAU Remember you were supposed to meet me at the bus stop a half-hour ago? 
SCOTT How could I possibly forget? 
24 INT. SONIC BOOM - DAY 24 
Scott and Knives flip through the record bins, out of sync. 
KNIVES CHAU Yearbook club is getting SO boring. I cannot believe the music they put on while we work. 
SCOTT That's sucky. 
25 INT. THE GOODWILL - DAY 25 
Knives buys a hip and trendy jacket. Scott sits on a couch next to the DO NOT SIT sign, still distracted. 
KNIVES CHAU Hannah broke up with Alan and now she's all into Derek... 
SCOTT Uh huh. 
26 EXT. PIZZA PIZZA - DAY 26 
Scott and Knives walk out of a pizza joint. Knives chows down on a slice. Scott doesn't eat, his thoughts elsewhere.

Scott and Knives play NINJA NINJA REVOLUTION, side by side. Scott plays halfheartedly, his timing off. 
KNIVES CHAU Combo! Knives goes to flip over Scott, but he messes up. THE MIRROR IMAGE of Scott's videogame avatar appears on screen. 
KNIVES CHAU Uh oh, NegaNinja. NEGANINJA - squares up against Scott's avatar. 
SCOTT I can never get past that guy. Scott has his little videogame head cut off. The 'CONTINUE?' countdown comes up...10...9...8... 
KNIVES CHAU Do you want to keep going? Scott takes a long look at Knives. 
SCOTT Um, I think...I think... Scott takes a deep breath. This is never easy. 3...2...1... 
28 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - EVENING 28 
STEPHEN STILLS Game on, everybody. Game. On. An excited Stills addresses Sex Bob-Omb. Scott tunes his bass, alone by the window, staring out. 
STEPHEN STILLS I got us a show. 
KNIVES CHAU (O.S.) 
OH MY GOSH WHEN?! Knives BURSTS into frame. Scott winces.

STEPHEN STILLS S'right. This guy at work was like "Steve, do you know anyone in a band?" and I was like 'I'm in a band' and he was like 'You're in a band?' and I was like 'Yeah I'm totally in a band'- 
KIM PINE Great story, man. 
RAMONA I need to find a new route. 
SCOTT Either that or you need to start hanging out with me. 
RAMONA You want me to hang out with you? 
SCOTT Um...you know...if that's cool. 
RAMONA If I say yes, will you sign for your damn package? Scott finally signs on the dotted line. And throws the package straight in the trash.

RAMONA Dude, I'm totally waiting on you. 
SCOTT Sorry, I just assumed you were too cool to be on time. 
RAMONA Well. You assumed wrong. 
SCOTT So what do you want to do? We could get a slice at Pizza Pizza or flip through some records at Sonic Boom. Oh, or there's this awesome game called Ninja Ninja Revolution at-

SCOTT I'm cool with whatever you want to do. 
RAMONA This is good. Scott and Ramona trudge through the snow in the empty park. 
SCOTT This is good. So how'd you end up in Toronto? 
RAMONA Just needed to escape I guess. 
SCOTT Oh yeah? 
RAMONA I got this job here. And Gideon had always said Toronto was one of the great cities so... 
SCOTT Is Gideon...is he your boyfriend? 
RAMONA He's...a friend. 
SCOTT Was he your boyfriend? 
RAMONA Do you mind if we don't get into that right now? 
SCOTT It's so not interesting to me. They sit on some swings in the park. 
RAMONA So what about you? What do you do? 
SCOTT I'm between jobs. 
RAMONA Between what and what? 
SCOTT My last job is a long story filled with sighs.

RAMONA Pretty much. It was time to head somewhere a little more chilled. 
SCOTT Well, it's certainly chilled here. 
RAMONA Yeah. Uh. Chilled as in cold. 
RAMONA Yeah. 
SCOTT I'm totally obsessed with you. 
RAMONA I didn't mean to get you obsessed. 
SCOTT I just haven't been obsessed with a girl for a long time. It's weird. 
RAMONA That's probably because you sleep with a guy. 
SCOTT Um... 
RAMONA I was guessing from your apartment, but you totally do!

SCOTT (CONT'D) I'm... mostly stupid. 
RAMONA You have to leave. 
37 EXT. RAMONA'S APARTMENT - MORNING 37 
Ramona skates towards the front gate, Scott walking next to her. WAIST DEEP SNOW covers the roads and sidewalks. 
SCOTT Hey, can this not be a one night stand? For one thing, I didn't even get any...that was a joke. 
RAMONA What did you have in mind?

38 INT. THE ROCKIT - NIGHT 38 
'THE ROCKIT, FUN FACT: THIS PLACE IS A TOILET'. Ramona wades through a grungy venue under the stare of young hipsters, reaching Scott at the bar. He stands with Wallace and Stacey. She holds hands with a guy wearing glasses. 
SCOTT You totally came! 
RAMONA Yes. I did totally come. Scott is so amazed at her presence, his social skills vanish. 
STACEY Excuse my brother. He's chronically enfeebled. I'm Stacey. 
RAMONA Hey. 
STACEY And this is Wallace, his room-mate. 
WALLACE Hey.

KNIVES CHAU Hey. Knives pecks Scott on the cheek. He pushes her away. Knives looks kinda sexy, wearing makeup and new clothes. 
KNIVES CHAU Do you like? 
SCOTT I...uh... LEONE STAREDOWNS all around. Stacey stares at Scott. Knives and Ramona stare at each other. Wallace stares at Jimmy. 
SCOTT (CONT'D) Have. To. Go. Scott scurries off. We hear feedback from a mic onstage. 
PROMOTER (O.S) This next band are from Brampton and they are Crash And The Boys. 
39 INT. THE ROCKIT, BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 39 
Scott runs backstage to see Stills obsessively flipping through a chart with hand drawn stats of their rival band. 
STEPHEN STILLS This is a nightmare. Is this a nightmare? Wake up, wake up, wake up. 
KIM Once we're on stage you'll be fine. 
STILLS We were just on stage. For sound check. The sound guy hated us. 
SCOTT It's just nerves! Pre-show jitters. People love us. Right? Scott sounds less than convincing. He looks up at Ramona and Knives sitting with Wallace, Jimmy and Stacey in the BALCONY.

Crash and The Boys tune up. A drunk Wallace turns to Jimmy. 
WALLACE Jimmy. Do they rock or suck? 
JIMMY They...haven't started playing yet. 
WALLACE That was a test, Jimmy. You passed. 
CRASH Good evening. I am Crash, and these are the Boys. 
WALLACE 
IS THAT GIRL A BOY, TOO? 
CRASH Yes. TRASHA, 8 year old girl drummer, gives Wallace the finger. 
FIGHT! Scott throws his bass to Young Neil and BLOCKS Patel with his left arm, then PUNCHES him across the floor with his right. Patel LANDS like a cat, FLIPS his fringe and GLARES at Scott. 
MATTHEW PATEL Alright. Alright. 
WALLACE Watch out! It's that one guy! 
SCOTT Thank you, Wallace! Patel RUNS at Scott. Scott SPIN KICKS Patel in the chin and sends him flying into the air. They land in THE PIT, knocking hipsters down and squaring off in the resulting circle. 
MATTHEW PATEL You're quite the opponent, Pilgrim. 
SCOTT Who the hell are you anyway? The LIGHTING GUY spotlights the fighters. 
MATTHEW PATEL My name is Matthew Patel and I'm Ramona's first evil ex-boyfriend!

SCOTT I skimmed it. 
MATTHEW PATEL You will pay for your insolence! Patel attacks, landing kicks and punches. Scott evades and counter-attacks. Patel evades, then lands more punches. Scott jump-spins away from danger. They pause, breathing heavy. 
WALLACE What's up with his outfit? 
OTHER HECKLER Yeah! Is he a pirate? Scott looks at Patel's outfit. 
SCOTT Are you a pirate? 
MATTHEW PATEL Pirates are in this year! Patel attacks again. They exchange furious blows, until Patel puts Scott in a choke hold. Scott looks up to Ramona. 
SCOTT You really went out with this guy? 
RAMONA Yeah, in the seventh grade. The Lighting Guy SWINGS the spotlight to Ramona in the balcony. We see a sketchy childlike ANIMATED FLASHBACK. 
RAMONA (CONT'D) It was football season and for some reason, all the little jocks wanted me. Matthew was the only non-white, non-jock boy in school, probably in the entire state, so we joined forces and took 'em all out. We were one hell of a team. Nothing could beat Matthew's mystical powers. Nothing but pre-teen capriciousness. We only kissed once. After a week and a half, I told him to hit the showers.

MATTHEW PATEL You'll pay for this, Flowers! Patel SNAPS his fingers and launches into a BOLLYWOOD SONG! 
MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D) If you want to fight me, you're not the brightest. You won't know what's hit you in the slightest. Patel levitates into the air. Four hot girls in skirts with fangs and bat-wings appear in the air around him. 
MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D) Me and my fireballs and my Demon Hipster Chicks, I'm talking the talk because I know I'm slick. Patel and the Demon Hipster Chicks shoot FIREBALLS at Scott. He flips back onto the stage, narrowly dodging the attack. 
MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D) Fireball Girls! Take this sucker down. The Demon Hipster Chicks unleash more fireballs. Scott dodges. The house drum kit is trashed behind him. 
MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D) Let us show him what we're all about. Scott hits the ground, dodging a third wave of fireballs. They explode Crash and the Boys in the wings. 
SCOTT That doesn't even rhyme. Scott rolls across the stage, GRABS one of Kim's CYMBALS and throws it Captain America style. It hits Patel square in the eyes. POOF, the Demon Hipster Chicks vanish. 
MATTHEW PATEL This is impossible, how can it be?! Scott leaps into the air. Patel opens his eyes just in time to see Scott Pilgrim's FIST racing towards his face. 
SCOTT Open your eyes. Maybe you'll see.

WALLACE Yes. I am stalking him later. 
SCOTT So, this Lucas Lee- 
WALLACE Lucas Lee is not important to you right now! Get out. 
SCOTT You suck. Surprising no one. Scott grumbles off. Wallace turns the television way up. We see Lucas Lee on a payphone in some crummy thriller. 
LUCAS LEE (ON TV) Listen close and listen hard, bucko. The next click is me hanging up. The one after that...is me pulling the trigger. 
54 EXT. PAYPHONE ON BUSY STREET - DAY 54 
A shivering and annoyed Scott dials the payphone. 
SCOTT Oh, hey, Knives. Um, do you want to, like, talk or whatever? 
KNIVES CHAU (O.S.) Are you wearing a tan jacket? Like a spring jacket? And a hoodie? 
SCOTT Ummm... Scott checks what he's wearing. SPOOKY MUSIC underscores. 
KNIVES CHAU (O.S.) And a dorky hat?! 
SCOTT It's not dorky! Why are you psychic? A beaming Knives knocks on the payphone glass. 
SCOTT (CONT'D) Oh. Uh...okay. Hi. 
INTEGRATED FINAL 47. 
55 INT. SONIC BOOM - DAY 55 
The SPOOKY MUSIC continues on in the record store. Scott is on edge as Knives geeks over a standee for THE CLASH AT DEMONHEAD: it features sultry blonde singer ENVY ADAMS posing and the rest of the band shrouded in shadow and mist. 
KNIVES CHAU I can't believe they're coming to town. Will you take me to the show? 
SCOTT Yeah, listen- The SPOOKY MUSIC gets louder, pounding inside Scott's head. 
KNIVES CHAU Oh, hey, I wanted to invite you over for dinner. 
SCOTT Like, Chinese food? 
KNIVES CHAU Yeah. 
SCOTT Hmm. It's not my favorite. 
KNIVES CHAU Yeah. Well, to meet my parents. It's my birthday dinner. 
SCOTT Uh...I think that's a really bad idea. Like, really, just so bad. 
KNIVES CHAU No, it's okay. Why? 
SCOTT Well I mean, I'm too old for you! 
KNIVES CHAU No you're not! My Dad is nine years older than my Mom...

56 INT. THE BUS / RECORD STORE - DAY 56 
Scott sits on the bus alone, thinking about Knives. CROSSCUT with Knives still in the record store, in shock. ON THE BUS: Scott sighs, thinks of something happier... CROSSCUT with Ramona: rollerblading, her funky pink hair. ON THE BUS: Scott smiles, a little happier. 
57 INT/EXT. STEPHEN STILLS' BASEMENT - EVENING 57 
Sex Bob-Omb tune up. Kim spins a drumstick in her fingers. 
KIM PINE Where's Knives? Not coming tonight? 
SCOTT Oh. No. We broke up. Young Neil PAUSES his DS. Kim and Stills share a look. 
SCOTT (CONT'D) OH! Check it out, I learned the bass line from Final Fantasy 2. Scott plays the insanely simple video game tune. 
KIM PINE Scott, you are the salt of the earth.

KIM PINE Wait. I meant scum of the earth. 
SCOTT Aw, thanks.

YOUNG NEIL Newnew. Kim mimes shooting herself. Stills unplugs Scott's amp. 
STEPHEN STILLS Okay! From here on out, no GIRLFRIENDS or GIRLFRIEND talk at practice, whether they're old, new or new-new. We were lucky to survive that last round. This is sudden death now. Okay?

SCOTT Garlic bread is my favorite food. I could honestly eat it for every meal. Or just all the time without even stopping. 
RAMONA You'd get fat. 
SCOTT No. Why would I get fat? 
RAMONA Bread makes you fat. 
SCOTT Bread makes you FAT?? 
'15 MINUTES LATER' A nervy Scott serenades Ramona on his bass guitar. 
SCOTT So I wrote a song about you. 
RAMONA Oh yeah? 
SCOTT Yeah, it goes like this: Ra-mona, Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ra-mona, Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ooooh. 
RAMONA I can't wait to hear it when it's finished. 
SCOTT Finished? 
'15 MINUTES LATER' Scott makes out with Ramona on the futon. Scott smiles as she runs her hands through his hair.

SCOTT Ha. No, sorry. It's just that I got... I got a bad haircut right before me and my big ex broke up. But it's so long ago, I can barely remember it... A deep voiced NARRATOR chimes in. Earl Jones deep. 
NARRATOR Scott is acutely aware that his last salon haircut took place exactly 431 days ago, three hours before his big breakup. He blames this largely on the haircut and has been cutting his own hair ever since. 
RAMONA Sounds like a bad time. 
SCOTT Not really. 
NARRATOR It was. 
SCOTT It was a mutual thing. 
NARRATOR It wasn't. 
SCOTT I mean, she told me it was mutual. 
NARRATOR She dumped him. It was brutal. 
RAMONA What was her name? 
SCOTT She was Nat when I knew her. But she stopped liking that name. Then...she stopped liking me... 
RAMONA Your hair is cute. I like it long. 
SCOTT But it'd be cuter short! Wouldn't it?! Scott disappears and just as quickly reappears, now wearing his dorky SNOW HAT, hair tucked tightly beneath the flaps. 
RAMONA What? Why are you wearing that?

RAMONA Tell me we didn't come out here just so you could cover your hair with that hat. 
SCOTT Nooo. I just love me some walking. Putting one leg in front of the other. 
RAMONA You seem a little...heightened. 
SCOTT Yeah. I don't know. I just, when I'm with you I feel like I'm on drugs. Not that I do drugs, unless you do, in which case I do drugs all the time, every drug, but...you make me feel...I don't know. Things seem a little brighter around you or something. Ramona and Scott finally reach the top of the stairs and NIGHT TURNS TO DAY, as if crossing a magical line. 
RAMONA What is this place? 
SCOTT A totally awesome castle. They're shooting this movie up here. Ramona looks up at the looming CASA LOMA, a castle surrounded by big, bright movie set lights. 
RAMONA Who's in it? 
SCOTT Winifred Hailey and some actor guy. 
RAMONA Oh, who? 
SCOTT I forget. Let's find out.

SCOTT ...no. 
LUCAS LEE Oh, well then don't worry about it.

SCOTT So you can sell them, but can you do a thingy on that rail? Scott points to the LONG HANDRAIL on the stairs. 
LUCAS LEE It's called a grind, bro. 
SCOTT So can you do a grind thingy now? 
LUCAS LEE Are you serious? There's like 200 steps and the rails are garbage. 
SCOTT Hey, if it's too hardcore... 
LUCAS LEE You really think you can goad me into doing a trick like that? 
SCOTT There's girls watching. 
LUCAS LEE Somebody get me my board. Wallace taps Lucas' shoulder and hands him his skateboard. 
WALLACE Hi. Big fan. 
LUCAS LEE Why wouldn't you be? CLACK! Lucas GOES FOR IT, a perfect ollie onto the rail. Scott and Wallace watch as Lucas disappears from sight, sparking down the ENDLESS RAIL...HSSSSSSSSSSSSSS... Cut back to Scott & Wallace, impressed at Lucas.

Scott slumps on the couch, phone pressed to his ear. Wallace cooks bacon in the kitchen (no pants). We hear the OUTGOING MESSAGE: This is an automated voice messaging system. RAMONA is not available, please record your message after the beep. 
SCOTT Hey. It's me, Scott again. Call me back. Scott Pilgrim. 
(HANGS UP) What's the deal? Seriously. Scott ambles over to the fridge and rests his head on it. 
WALLACE Yeah, you said that last night. 
SCOTT You know what really sucks though? 
WALLACE What? 
SCOTT Everything! 
WALLACE Come on guy, you can't say you didn't see this coming. It was right under your nose. Wallace points to the NOTE Ramona scribbled which is pinned literally under Scott's nose on the refrigerator: RAMONA FLOWERS, 212 664-7665, xxxxxxx

MYSTERY ATTACKER Okay little chicken, then I'll see you later. But you won't see me. Because I'll be deadly serious next time.

Scott approaches the counter. Stacey has her back turned. 
SCOTT Think I'll make it a decaf today. Stacey turns around, revealing herself to be JULIE! 
JULIE 
SCOTT PILGRIM! 
SCOTT AH! What did you do with my sister? Stacey taps on the window outside, mouthing that she has to go. Scott turns back to Julie, not happy. 
JULIE What can I fucking get you? 
SCOTT Is there anywhere you don't work? 
JULIE They're called 'jobs', something a fuckball like you wouldn't know anything about. And by the way, I can't believe you fucking asked Ramona out after I specifically told you not to fucking do that! (Note to concerned reader: Everytime Julie says "FUCK", a black bar comes out of her mouth and the sound is bleeped.) 
SCOTT How do you do that with your mouth? 
JULIE Neverfuckingmind how I do it! What do you have to say for yourself?

JULIE Fucking speaking of fucking which, I hear the girl that kicked your heart in the ass is walking the streets of Toronto again. 
SCOTT So I can pick up my coffee over here? Scott retreats away from Julie and bumps right into... RAMONA. They share an awkward moment. She looks at the floor. 
RAMONA Sorry that got a little crazy last night. 
OTHER SCOTT And you didn't bang her? Are you gay? 
SCOTT I couldn't stop thinking about my stupid ex-girlfriend. A bleary Jimmy sits up between them all. 
JIMMY Is that the Uma Thurman movie? 
WALLACE Scott. Just because Envy's back in town doesn't make it not over. 
SCOTT Double negative. Tricky. 
OTHER SCOTT It's over. Move on.

KIM PINE All our shows are secret shows. 
STEPHEN STILLS We're doing it. G-man might be there! We play the next round of the battle Saturday. We need to get some buzz going. We need groundswell. We need stalkers. Stills paces past the window to reveal...KNIVES CHAU OUTSIDE. CRASH ZOOM on her tearful face, pressed against the window. TOTALLY CRUSHED to see Scott cuddling with Ramona. 
SCOTT What would you do? If your ex was in a band and they wanted you to open for them? 
RAMONA If my ex was in the band?

TAMARA We should rinse- 
KNIVES CHAU I mean, he knew I was cool but he thought I was too young, so he tried to find someone cool but old. 
TAMARA She's cool? I thought she was fat- 
KNIVES CHAU Well she THINKS she's cool. This is all her fault. 
TAMARA Why? Tamara turns the faucet on and rinses Knives hair. 
KNIVES CHAU It MUST be her fault. Obviously it's just a twist of fate or whatever, isn't it? Star crossed lovers! Born too late! Knives looks in the mirror: HER HAIR IS EXACTLY LIKE RAMONA.

YOUNG NEIL He punched the highlights. Out. Of. Her. Hair. 
ENVY You're incorrigible.

SCOTT No kidding...anyone can be...vegan. 
TODD INGRAM Ovo-lacto vegetarian maybe. 
SCOTT Ovo what? 
TODD INGRAM I partake not in the meat nor breastmilk or ovum of any creature that has a face. 
ENVY Short answer: Being vegan just makes you better than most people. 
TODD INGRAM Bingo. Todd lifts up Scott telekinetically and throws him miles into the air. Scott sails out of shot and into space. 
STEPHEN STILLS Hey man, question. I always wondered, how does not eating dairy products give you psychic powers? 
TODD INGRAM You know how you only use ten percent of your brain? Well, it's because the other 90% is filled up with curds and whey. 
SCOTT OKAY! I had to fight a dude to get with her! I fought a crazy eighty foot tall purple suited dude! And I had to fight 96 guys to get to him, too! He was flying and shooting lightning bolts from his eyes! He was totally awesome and I kicked him so far he saw the curvature of the earth! Does that make you feel any better? 
RAMONA Well now you are being a total ass. Welcome to the club. In the back glass of the bar, Scott sees his reflection: fringed hair, wicked glare. He catches himself.

WALLACE (O.S) Presumably you just saw someone's junk, and I apologize for that. 
VOICE (O.S.) Sorry. 
SCOTT (O.S.) Was that Other Scott or Jimmy or someone? 
WALLACE (O.S.) Or someone. 
VOICE (O.S.) It's Chris. 
WALLACE (O.S.) It's Chris. 
89 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - LATER 89 
Scott sits in the chair, wrapped in a blanket. SOME GUY lies in Scott's usual futon spot (wearing Wallace's monogrammed robe). Wallace hands Scott cocoa. 
WALLACE Scott, you know I love you. But I need my own bed tonight. For sex. 
SCOTT Right. 
WALLACE I may need it the rest of the week too. 
SCOTT Right. And the year. 
SCOTT I get it. 
WALLACE Maybe you can move in with Ramona. Scott stares deep into his cocoa and shakes his head. 
SCOTT She's with Gideon. 
WALLACE Ah. That sucks. But you know, it's probably just because he's better than you.

WALLACE Either way, I think this fight is over. Scott nods. 
WALLACE You can sleep on the floor until you get somewhere else to stay. I got you muffs and blinkers in case this might happen. Wallace produces earmuffs and a sleep mask. 
SCOTT Thanks. RINGY RING. Scott stares at the phone. Some guy picks up. 
SOME GUY It's for Scott. 
SCOTT 
(TAKES PHONE) Hello? 
GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.) Hey, pal. Just wanted to say I feel terrible about earlier. I don't want any hard feelings, so I figured why not be the bigger man and give you a call. 
SCOTT Is Ramona with you? 
90 INT. GIDEON'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS 90 
Gideon appears to sit on some kind of throne. He calls off. 
GIDEON GRAVES I don't know. Are you with me? 
RAMONA (O.S.) Yeah. 
SCOTT (O.S.) 
A HORDE OF HIPSTER INDIE KIDS ATTACK SCOTT PILGRIM, ON BEAT. Scott swings at them with his FLAMING BLUE SWORD. He slashes at them to the beat, exploding each attacker into COINS. Scott then RUNS up the side of the pyramid towards Gideon. 
GIDEON GRAVES Ramona. My cane. Ramona hands Gideon a cane with G-MAN engraved on the handle. He unsheathes a SWORD that could not have fit in there. Scott and Gideon LEAP towards each other...Gideon descends like a vulture and SMASHES the sword out of Scott's hands. Scott hits the ground HARD, rolling to a stop. 
SCOTT Your club sucks, by the way. Gideon approaches, to administer a final blow. 
GIDEON If my cathedral of cutting edge taste holds no interest for your tragically Canadian sensibilities, then I shall grant you a swift exit from the premises. And fast entrance into HELLLLLLL. Gideon raises his sword. Then from above... 
KNIVES CHAU (O.S.) 
SCOOOOOOOOOTT!!! KNIVES CHAU sails into frame and KICKS the sword out of Gideon's hands. She lands awkwardly, tripping and falling down the side of the pyramid. Gideon chuckles. 
GIDEON GRAVES That is priceless. Scott looks to Knives, both concerned and amazed. She quickly recovers and POINTS a furious finger. 
'KNIVES CHAU, 18 YEARS OLD, FUN FACT: SCOTTAHOLIC'

KNIVES CHAU You'll pay for what you did to him! 
GIDEON GRAVES Listen, Kung Pao Chicken, your old old boyfriend brought this all on himself. He was warned plenty of times. But did he listen? Did he f- 
KNIVES CHAU I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to HER! Angle on a confused RAMONA standing behind Gideon. 
RAMONA What? 
KNIVES CHAU 
YOU BROKE THE HEART THAT BROKE 
MINE! GET READY TO CHAU DOWN! Knives leaps up the pyramid toward a shocked Ramona! 
RAMONA You're kidding right? Knives pulls out KNIVES and charges! Ramona fights defensively, redirecting Knives' parries without harming her. 
GIDEON You can't say I don't know how to put on a show. GIDEON lashes out at Scott. He can barely block Gideon's tremendous blows, distracted by his duelling exes. 
RAMONA What the hell is your deal? 
KNIVES CHAU You stole him with your advanced American slut technology. DUAL DUEL! The fighters weave in and out of each other, throwing blocks and punches, KUNG FU STYLE. 
RAMONA I don't know what you're talking about, I didn't steal anyone. Scott lands a KICK to Gideon's chest, sending him flying off the edge of the pyramid. He then BLOCKS a punch from Knives to Ramona and spins her away, separating them.

94 CONTINUED: (4) 94 
SCOTT Can we please stop all this fighting! Nobody stole anybody. Knives, I dated you and then I dated Ramona. Okay? 
(BEAT) I mean...maybe I kind of forgot to tell Knives right away, but... 
KNIVES CHAU Then you cheated on me, Scott! 
(EYES NARROWING) You cheated on both of us. Knives and Ramona both look at Scott, neither amused. 
RAMONA You cheated on me with Knives? 
SCOTT No! I cheated on Knives. With you. 
RAMONA Is there a difference? 
SCOTT You weren't wronged? Scott breaks into a flop sweat. 
SCOTT Right? Knives and Ramona stare at Scott. 
GIDEON (O.S.) Game over! STAB! A sword pierces Scott's chest from behind. 
GIDEON GRAVES Scottie. You can cheat on these ladies all you want, but you can't...cheat...death. Scott slides off Gideon's sword and falls to the ground... 
TEXT WITH ARROW POINTING TO SCOTT: 'DEAD' Everything goes white...SAND blows through frame...Scott's eyes blink open. He looks up into a BLINDING BLUE SKY... 
95 EXT. THE DREAM DESERT - DAY 95 
Scott sits up next to a lone cactus, rubbing his temples.

RAMONA I'm sorry. Dying probably sucks. 
SCOTT You know what sucks? Getting killed by THAT guy. Why him? 
RAMONA It's complicated. 
SCOTT Well, maybe now would be the time to get into it. Seeing as I'm about to die. 
RAMONA Alright... the truth is, it was me who was obsessed. I was crazy about him. But he ignored me. I was more alone when we were together than I ever was on my own. That's why I had to leave... and that's when he started paying attention. 
SCOTT So why go back? 
RAMONA I can't help myself around him, Scott. He just... has a way of getting into my head. 
SCOTT Well, that's legitimately disappointing. I really will leave you alone forever now... 
RAMONA No. I mean, he literally has a way of getting into my head. Ramona lifts her hair up on the back of her head, revealing a blinking CHIP implanted on her skull. 
SCOTT That is evil.

LABOR OF LOVE 
by 
M. Night Shyamalan 
FADE IN: 
EXT.  ROUTE 476 - OUTSKIRTS OF PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT 
A three lane highway relegated to one lane.  The serpentine line of cars bottlenecks as it slithers by.  An arch of ORANGE AND RED FLARES outlines the area of shattered glass and twisted metal. 
We are at the site of a gruesome car accident.  An ambulance and four police cars are on the scene.  Two cars are involved in the crash.  The first, a SILVER CADILLAC with its front caved in a perfect semi-circle; there is no-one inside the car. 
The second car is a different story entirely.  A DARK GREEN HONDA PRELUDE crushed against the concrete median that separates the South-bound lanes from the North-bound lanes. All the windows have imploded.  The original seventeen foot length of the car, compressed to ten.  The hood has folded back into the front seat.  This car is not empty!  Through the sliver that used to be a window, WE SEE a female hand, purple, swollen and bloody. 
Some drivers have stopped their cars on the shoulder and have walked over to the flares.  A set of cops wave them back. 
POLICE OFFICER Get back in your cars and continue with the traffic.  There is nothing you can do. (beat) Get back in your cars... 
CUT TO: 
OFFICER PIERCE speaks to a female OFFICER DANA. 
OFFICER PIERCE What's the story? 
OFFICER DANA She's been dead about ten minutes. The jaws are on the way... Ran a license check.  Her name is Ellen Parker.  Forty-two years old. 
OFFICER PIERCE What about him? 
Pierce gestures to a HISPANIC TEENAGER who is cuffed behind his back and being led to a police car. 
OFFICER DANA D.U.I. 
OFFICER PIERCE Shit... How old is he? 
OFFICER DANA Seventeen.  It's his grandfather's car.  On his way back from drinking with the 'boys'. 
Pierce lets it sink in. 
OFFICER PIERCE Who do we contact for her? 
Dana checks the papers in her hand. 
OFFICER DANA Her husband.  Maurice Parker.  They live in Wynnewood.  Married seventeen years. 
Pierce looks back at what remains of the HONDA PRELUDE. Beat. 
OFFICER PIERCE There isn't any good left in the world, Dana.  Not one damn thing. 
CLOSE UP of the hypnotic RED AND BLUE LIGHTS that consume the highway. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  ROAD - EARLY MORNING 
"TWO WEEKS EARLIER" 
Just AFTER DAWN.  A gentle mist hangs in the air.  The calm suburban streets wait to be flooded with a sea of middle class homeowners on their way to work... 
A woman's REEBOK CROSS-TRAINERS move along the sidewalk... long, brisk steps, steps people have when walking with a purpose... 
The Cross-Trainers enter the doors of a bakery store seconds after a man turns a window-sign from "CLOSED" to "OPEN"... This happens with precision timing, not losing a step... a well practiced routine. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  ANGELO'S BAKERY - MORNING 
ANGELO, a large man, black slicked hair -- has laid out three identical loaves of RAISIN BREAD on the counter. 
ANGELO Very good batch today. 
We finally see the person standing in the REEBOK CROSS TRAINERS... MRS. ELLEN PARKER, a woman in her forties with a heart-warming smile and wise glint in her eyes.  The kind of woman that somehow becomes more beautiful with age. 
She carefully squeezes each loaf.  Her hand hovers over the middle loaf. 
ELLEN That one. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING 
Twenty minutes later.  The basket of the "chosen" raisin bread is placed on the center of a table.  Ellen covers it with a cloth napkin. 
The eggs sizzle in a pan.  We find Ellen cooking breakfast. A stunning African Grey Parrot sits proudly on Ellen's shoulder.  CLAUDE is a breathtaking creature with grey feathers and a cherry red tail. 
The DOOR BELL RINGS. 
CUT TO: 
FRONT DOOR 
where a delivery man hands over a bouquet of VIOLET ORCHIDS. Claude, still perched on Ellen like a clothing accessory, spreads his impressive wings defensively.  The delivery man scans the far wall to find a collection of bird photographs. A dazzling collection of all kinds of birds, elaborately framed and hung. 
Ellen signs the release and closes the door.  She takes a deep smell of the violet orchids and looks down the hall to the open bedroom door with a glowing smile.  We CATCH A GLIMPSE of a man dressing. 
CUT TO: 
KRIS You're amazing. 
MAURICE It has to be a full character's name. 
KRIS They called her 'Lizy' in the book... (beat) Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper. 
MAURICE They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening. 
KRIS Pulitzer, here I come. 
Kris notices as Maurice goes back to searching the isles. 
KRIS What happened? 
MAURICE Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else. 
ELLEN (on the end of his words) Kris, go to the pharmacy.  Ask Mr. Donnavan to get you a large bottle of Geritol... Tell him, Maurice has officially become a grumpy old man. 
KRIS What'd they take this time? 
MAURICE Nietzsche!... As if they're going to read Nietzsche. 
Maurice moves back behind the counter clearly irritated. 
ELLEN They pick on you because they can get a rise out of you... children can sense those things. 
Kris quickly opens his black shoulder bag and pulls out a mini-tape recorder.  He talks into it -- dead serious. 
KRIS Monday -- August 24... Juvenile delinquency -- Are the victims to blame? 
CLICK.  The tape recorder returns to the bag.  Ellen stares at him curiously. 
KRIS Story ideas.  I'll forget them otherwise. 
Ellen nods with realization.  Ellen and Kris turn their attention to Maurice who is mumbling to himself angrily.  He looks out the window to the street to see a familiar group of school boys waving at him tauntingly. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
DIMLY LIT.  Red and gold paper mache lanterns are sprinkled around the room.  WE FIND Ellen and Maurice polishing off a dish of General Tso's Chicken. 
MAURICE Two thousand square feet... We can add a used book section. 
Ellen is not listening.  She is staring at a young couple two tables over, who can't take their eyes off each other. 
MAURICE Next door is a jewelry store with a full-time security guard... He stands outside all day.  Let's see them try and take Nietzsche then... 
Maurice finally notices Ellen is not listening. 
MAURICE Ellen? 
ELLEN (snapping out of it) What? 
MAURICE The new store? 
ELLEN Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it. 
MAURICE It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving. 
ELLEN We can do it together. 
Maurice needed the support.  His face brightens. 
CUT TO: 
LATER 
An empty table.  The dishes have been cleared.  Maurice and Ellen are opening their fortune cookies. 
MAURICE What's your's say? 
Beat. 
ELLEN ... Love is shown through actions not just words. 
MAURICE What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement. 
ELLEN What it is -- is the truth. 
MAURICE I don't follow. 
Beat. 
ELLEN Maurice, what would you do for me? What would you do for our love? I'm not talking about saying, I'm talking about doing. 
Maurice notices the STRAIN IN HER VOICE. 
MAURICE Is this going to be similar to the flower incident? 
ELLEN (very emotional) Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore. 
MAURICE (raising his voice) You don't think I love you? 
Customers react. 
ELLEN (lowering the volume) I want to be shown... (beat) Maurice would you do anything for me? 
The bread gets laid out in its usual basket, in its usual manner.  Maurice says nothing as Ellen pulls two eggs from the fridge and cracks them on a sizzling pan with expert ease. 
ELLEN Onions? 
Maurice smiles warmly at his wife's back before moving to her and hugging her from behind.  He whispers in her ear. 
MAURICE Why do you put up with me? 
Beat. 
ELLEN Love... has something to do with it. 
Maurice reaches over and turns off the stove.  He then turn Ellen around and kisses her long and hard.  Ellen pulls away gently and stares into his eyes.  Maurice looks very emotional. 
MAURICE I do love you... very, very much. 
ELLEN Show me. 
MAURICE (with all his heart) I will -- I promise. 
Ellen kisses Maurice and returns to the eggs.  Maurice continues to hug her from behind.  The MORNING SUN pours into the kitchen covering Ellen and Maurice in a golden bath. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  EMPTY STORE - AFTERNOON 
A large black man wearing a dress shirt, sleeves rolled up to the elbows TURNS ON a switch.  A SET OF TUBE LIGHTS FLICKER TO LIFE. 
CARL STONE leads Maurice out to the main room which is presently a cob-web infested, barren space with a few discarded packing boxes left in the corners. 
Maurice runs his fingertips against the wall. 
MAURICE History and the arts will be here... 
His hand makes a grand swirl pointing to another area.  He says the next two words with great awe as if he was saying something holy. 
MAURICE The Classics... 
Carl watches curiously as Maurice walks around in a trance. He moves to the bay window that over looks the street. 
MAURICE We'll have a hand-painted sign... (another grand swirl) ... Parker Books. 
Maurice's already bright eyes, brighten even more as he spots the security guard strolling up and down the front of the jewelry store.  The guard catches his stare and waves. Maurice is aglow... He turns to Carl. 
MAURICE This is my dream... it's finally here. 
Carl has to smile -- rarely does he see someone so happy. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  OFFICE ROOM - AFTERNOON 
We are in Carl's cramped upstairs office... just enough room to walk amongst the file cabinets. 
Maurice holds his pen over the documents before him. 
MAURICE I wish my wife were here.  She should see this... (stalling) She had a doctors appointment in Blue Bell.  That's a one and a half hour drive.  Ellen's been going to that doctor since she moved to Pennsylvania... 
CARL (understanding) We could do this tomorrow? 
MAURICE Ellen gave me strict orders to sign it... We invited some friends over -- you see, for a celebration. 
Carl smiles patiently, he's seen this before. 
Maurice gathers his strength as he puts pen to paper... He scribbles his signature quickly and let's the pen drop to the table top as if all the energy drained from his body.  He looks up to Carl with powerful eyes. 
MAURICE Every journey begins with one step right? 
Beat. 
CARL Enjoy your party Mr. Parker... Your new store will be waiting for you Monday morning. 
Carl and Maurice shake hands like best friends. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  HOUSE - NIGHT 
A wine chiller sits proudly on the coffee table.  The SOUNDS OF LIGHT CONVERSATION float through the room.  About ten friends and family have gathered. 
Maurice sits on the sofa nearest the window.  He's listening to the drone of TED PRICE. 
Ellen is not present. 
TED ... So she says the "L" word, after two dates, the "L" word!  She says 'Don't you believe in true love? Love that can conquer all?'  I say, 'Whoa, hold on.  Just so we're clear on things, I think love these days is shit.  It don't mean a thing and it don't stand for nothing.  Shit.'... You know what she says, 'Fine, but how do you feel about kids?' 
Everyone near the SOFA LAUGHS.  A CAR LIGHT DANCES ON THE CURTAINS... Maurice quickly pulls the curtain aside and watches as the car pulls past the house and around the corner.  Maurice turns back from the window hiding his concern and without missing a beat... 
MAURICE It's nice to see you don't have any scars from your divorce. 
This brings on another ROUND OF LAUGHTER. 
THE TELEPHONE RINGS. 
Maurice rises from his seat -- but is waved off by ADELLE MATLIN who picks up the phone right away.  Adelle is Maurice's niece, early thirties, very attractive and always smiling -- except at this moment. 
Ted begins another one of his stories -- the words are incoherent as Maurice watches Adelle carefully... Adelle turns her back to the room as she talks and then DISAPPEARS into the kitchen stretching the phone cord around the doorway... Something is definitely wrong. 
CUT TO: 
PARK BENCH 
Maurice is seated on a park bench.  Across from him is an ELDERLY COUPLE -- in their seventies.  The OLD WOMAN is frail with tiny eyes that disappear when she smiles.  The husband is a skinny man with a baseball hat that makes him look like a little boy. 
Maurice watches them silently as they sit and hold hands... Their warm laughs and whispered conversations stinging him. He watches as the old man gets up.  The old woman tries to make him stay, but he playfully pulls away.  She shakes her head like a shy school girl as the old man walks back down the path by himself. 
The old woman glances Maurice's way. 
OLD WOMAN Good morning. 
MAURICE Good morning. 
The old woman glances at the empty baby carriage standing next to the bench. 
OLD WOMAN Is it a boy or a girl? 
MAURICE Oh, that's not mine. 
Maurice gestures to the woman and baby who are sitting on a blanket in the grass. 
MAURICE I don't have kids. 
OLD WOMAN You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four. 
The old woman studies him. 
OLD WOMAN Are you okay? 
Beat. 
MAURICE Is that your husband? 
She nods, "Yes." 
MAURICE You look so happy -- how long have you been married? 
OLD WOMAN Forty-seven years. 
This hits Maurice hard. 
OLD WOMAN Are you married? 
This hits Maurice even harder. 
MAURICE (this is painful) Yes... Seventeen years. 
The old woman looks down the path for her husband. 
MAURICE Where did he go? 
OLD WOMAN He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze. (shaking her head) I told him not to go. 
Beat. 
MAURICE May I ask you a question that might sound strange? 
OLD WOMAN Yes. 
Beat. 
MAURICE How do you know he loves you? 
The old woman looks at him oddly. 
MAURICE I mean besides... time -- how did you know ten years ago -- twenty years ago? 
She thinks hard... tough question.  No answer for a moment then -- 
The old woman sees something out of the corner of her eye -- her husband is walking up the path with her white lace sweater over his arm... 
She smiles as the answer comes to her. 
OLD WOMAN Because he shows me... he's not much for words, but he shows me. 
Maurice sits back -- her answer lingers in the air like a haunting voice. 
Maurice watches as the old man comes back and drapes his wife with the sweater.  The old woman waves as they continue down the path... hand in hand. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  DOCTORS OFFICE - DAY 
An obese woman with a hacking cough sits to the left of Maurice... To the right, a man with a patch over his eye. 
NURSE Parker... Maurice Parker. 
The nurse sticks her head outside the glass divider till Maurice stands up. 
CUT TO: 
EXAMINATION ROOM 
DR. ROYCE checks a chart.  Maurice watches him from his perch on the examination chair. 
DR. ROYCE So what's the deal Maurice? 
KRIS I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them. 
MAURICE To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you. 
KRIS This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens. 
MAURICE Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great. 
Beat. 
KRIS Why are you telling me this Mr. Parker? 
Maurice looks out the window and picks up an envelope from the coffee table between them.  He hands it to Kris. 
MAURICE Your bus is arriving. 
Kris opens the envelope and finds money. 
MAURICE It's one month's pay. 
Kris gets up.  A shock of adrenaline hits him. 
KRIS Are you firing me? 
MAURICE No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim. 
Kris grabs his coat, shifting his attention between the window and Maurice? 
KRIS You going on a trip Mr. Parker? 
MAURICE Yes. 
KRIS Where? 
MAURICE California. 
Kris moves to the door. 
KRIS That's cool.  What day are you arriving? 
Beat. 
MAURICE I'm not sure -- sometime in January I think. 
Kris stops cold.  The door to the street half-open. 
KRIS When are you leaving? 
MAURICE Tomorrow. 
Kris is seriously confused now.  Maurice decides to end the confusion. 
MAURICE I'm walking there Kris. 
KRIS Walking where? 
MAURICE California. 
Kris' jaw hits the floor as the bus pulls to a stop across the street.  Kris pulls up his sleeve and glances at his forearm. 
KRIS The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening. 
MAURICE I always knew you had good instincts... (beat) Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back. 
Kris hesitates before darting out of the store, across the street and into the bus.  Kris takes a seat in the back and digs into his bag and pulls out the tape recorder.  CLICK. 
KRIS Thursday, September 25... 'The Death Of A Spouse - Can It Drive You Insane?' 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  WYNNEWOOD PENNSYLVANIA - DAWN 
A BRILLIANT RED HUE BLANKETS THE HORIZON. 
The suburbs come to life... Men and women leaving for work... School buses picking up their cargo of passengers... Store owners opening their businesses... 
CUT TO: 
PARKER BOOKS 
A group of eleven year old boys including the two kleptomaniacs we saw earlier, are standing before a closed door staring at a sign.  They look at each other before heading down the block. 
The sign reads:  CLOSED - OWNER OUT OF TOWN. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  HOUSE - MORNING 
The house is eerily silent. 
Three things lay on the dining table.  A shoulder bag filled with clothes.  A carrying bag with personals.  And a set of maps. 
Maurice checks the locks on all windows... He places all the food in the refrigerator into a trash bag... He pulls out a drawer and loosens a side panel, a wad of money flops out. Maurice pockets the bills... 
Maurice walks through the hall with a portable cage.  He stops before Claude's hanging cage... no movement, no chirping.  Maurice stares emotionally for a moment before reaching in and carefully removing CLAUDE'S LIFELESS BODY from the bottom of the cage.  Maurice looks down at the lost pet in his hands. 
MAURICE I know how you feel. 
The neon MOTEL SIGN THROBS RED. 
SUPERIMPOSED across this image are the words: 
PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA... MILE 26 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  MOTEL - MORNING 
Maurice looks down the highway... eyes squinting to block out the sun.  The road winds and dissolves into the horizon... Maurice looks back the way he came -- a second of indecision... the moment passes. 
Maurice takes a deep breath before moving to the CRUSHED COKE CAN.  He moves to the exact spot where he left the road the night before and begins walking again... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  NEWSPAPER BUILDING - MORNING 
The elevator BELL dings, letting off a cargo of newspaper personnel.  FRANK AND SETH are two of them.  They make their way to the desks... a sea of desks pressed against each other -- each desk has a computer. 
Frank and Seth come to their corner and stop before a young man, Phillies cap turned backwards, sitting behind an IBM 486 DX... fingers flying over the keyboard. 
FRANK Someone's got a hot story. 
SETH What time did you get in? 
Kris Reddy keeps typing.  He spits out the answer after a few seconds. 
KRIS Five... Couldn't sleep. 
FRANK What's this one about Kris? 'Blinds or Curtains - The Eternal Question?' 
SETH No, no... 'Boxers Verses Tight Undies - The Battle Continues.' 
Frank and Seth crack up laughing.  Frank reaches for the printouts... Kris immediately covers them with his hand.  He stares up with a smile. 
KRIS Read about it on Sunday. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  STREET - DAY 
Maurice exits an athletic store in a small town.  On his feet a new pair of sneakers. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  STREET - DAY 
Maurice as he walks down a winding highway.  His new sneakers shuffling slowly. 
A SHARP PAIN SHOOTS UP MAURICE'S LEG.  His knees buckle.  The shoulder bags tumble to the ground followed by Maurice himself.  From a distance it looks like he's been shot. 
Maurice grabs the back of his thigh and tries to straighten his leg out... His face frozen in a painful expression. Maurice rubs his legs slowly -- working the cramp out.  He relaxes a bit as he finally straightens his leg.  Maurice sits there motionless -- eyes glazed... defeated. 
The SOUNDS OF A BIRD snap him out of his trance.  He looks up to see a PAINTED BUNTING, a bird about six inches in height FLY DOWN from a tree and land on a rock next to him.  Maurice stares at the beautiful bird curiously.  Its body splashed with brilliant blues, reds and greens.  It looks out of place in these mundane surroundings.  Maurice looks around the skies to see no other birds.  The Painted Bunting chirps a few times before taking flight into the air.  It circles over Maurice before disappearing behind the trees. 
Maurice smiles.  He pulls himself to his feet with great effort. 
Maurice opens all of his bags and begins emptying the essentials -- the maps, food, a canister of water. 
Maurice reloads one bag and pulls it over his shoulder with great effort.  At his feet, are the rest of his belonging -- piled on the side of the road. 
Maurice painfully begins walking again. 
WE PULL BACK on Maurice's figure walking on the highway... the pile of disregarded things laying by the side... The highway is endless... winding it's way for miles and miles into a fixed dot in the distance. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  ADELLE'S HOUSE - MORNING 
Sunrise on Pennsylvania.  Gerald picks the Philadelphia Gazette off the front porch. 
CUT TO: 
DINING ROOM 
Gerald flips open the paper as he waits before an empty plate. 
GERALD Smells good, honey. 
CUT TO: 
KITCHEN 
Adelle puts the finishing touches on a stack of pancakes. She sets up two plates and brings them into the 
DINING ROOM 
Gerald's eyes remain glued to the paper.  Adelle comes to the table, holding the golden pancakes over the table.  She notices the strange look on his face. 
ADELLE What is it? 
GERALD Adelle... Maurice is in the paper. 
She stares silently at the paper laid out on the table.  The headline beams at her: 
A PHILADELPHIA NATIVE'S LABOR OF LOVE 
ROAD - DUSK 
It's raining hard like gun-fire from the sky.  Maurice sits on the edge of a road rubbing his legs.  His hair matted to his head.  The rain pelts the ground in forceful waves. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
SUPPLY STORE 
At a cash register, Maurice slaps ten more boxes of Ben-Gay down on the counter.  A teenage girl with braces looks at him like he's Charles Manson. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
MOTEL 
Maurice sleeps.  His barefeet are propped up on his bag.  His feet are swollen and red with fresh blisters.  A pack of ice is wrapped around his knee with an old shirt... The picture of Ellen clutched in his hand. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
ROAD 
Two joggers pass Maurice as he sees a flashing school sign. It is a suburban town.  The fallen red and orange leaves cover every flat surface. 
SUPERIMPOSE:  ELKHART, INDIANA... MILE 598 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SCHOOL - DAY 
A line of cars pulls around a semi-circle driveway.  Maurice watches as parents drop off their children.  A couple of ten year old boys walk by. 
BOY Nice sneaks. 
Maurice realizes they're talking to him. 
MAURICE They are? 
BOY 2 Sure man, High-Top Nike Cross Trainers with heel supports and air cushioned soles -- They're nasty. 
The boys keep walking.  Maurice looks down at his sneakers with new-found pride. 
After a while, Maurice's attention switches back to the cars. One car in question catches Maurice's eye.  A woman consoles a small child who doesn't want to leave the car.  She wipes his tiny tears with her hand and hugs him tenderly.  The little boy's head cradled in her arms. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
The Parker house many years ago.  The house semi-furnished. Ellen carefully hangs her first bird photographs on the wall; a striking aerial photo of a GOLDEN EAGLE.  Wings spread, soaring high over a mountain range. 
MAURICE I thought we both wanted the same things. 
ELLEN I've changed my mind. 
MAURICE You can't change your mind. 
Beat.  Ellen takes a seat on the only sofa. 
ELLEN I want children. 
MAURICE You've just decided, is that right? 
ELLEN Yes. 
Young Maurice is visibly upset. 
MAURICE Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world -- 
ELLEN Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech. 
MAURICE ... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen. 
ELLEN You can change. 
MAURICE Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway. 
ELLEN (upset) Don't be so sure. 
Ellen fiddles with her dress.  She bites her bottom lip as she tries not to cry. 
ELLEN (shaky voice) What if something happens to one of us?  We'll be all alone. 
Maurice loses his hard demeanor and moves next to her.  He lays his hand across her shoulder. 
MAURICE Nothing will happen to us.  It's a bleak picture, I know, but we're going to be together till were old and grey and you don't remember my name anymore. 
Maurice lifts her chin with his hand gently.  She blinks her eyes and a tear rolls down her cheek.  He takes a deep breath. 
MAURICE Let me think about it okay. 
Ellen brightens up immediately. 
MAURICE I'm not saying anytime soon.  I'm just saying that maybe we can consider it down the road sometime. 
Ellen gives her patented glowing smile.  She hugs him with all her strength.  She whispers in his ear. 
ELLEN I love you Maurice Parker. 
CUT TO: 
Maurice is red with anger.  Denny loves it. 
DENNY Oh the preacher's getting angry again... (Denny goes ice cold) Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face -- 
MAURICE I'll kill you! 
Maurice swings.  Denny easily avoids it.  Maurice doesn't see the first BLOW COMING, IT HITS HIM IN THE CHEST -- Maurice gasps for air as he buckles to the dirt.  Hands grab -- restrain.  A POWERFUL KICK IN THE RIBS -- ANOTHER... LAUGHTER... ANOTHER SET OF VICIOUS KICKS... The road and forest begin to spin... A PAINFUL SLASH ACROSS HIS FACE... 
Maurice prepares for the next blow... it never comes.  RED AND BLUE lights swirl... Maurice looks up, barely focusing -- a man leans over a car door... The image becomes clearer -- a POLICEMAN stands poised -- gun aimed directly at the men hovering over him. 
POLICE OFFICER (distorted and slowed) Step away from him now! 
CUT TO: 
INT.  INDIANA POLICE STATION - EVENING 
OFFICER MERRIL GREY -- balances a phone on his shoulder as he spreads a new coat of mayonnaise on his hoagie. 
OFFICER GREY Need an I.D. check on a Maurice A. Parker... 
Grey reads Maurice's license. 
OFFICER GREY Driver's number 22 184 877... (listening) He was assaulted by a group of men just outside Elkhart, Indiana... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  PHILADELPHIA POLICE STATION - EVENING 
Sergeant Dally, the officer Adelle spoke to earlier, listens on the other end of the phone his mouth agape. 
DALLY How is he?... That's good. 
Gesturing to a young officer at another desk to come over. Dally, cups the phone. 
DALLY Call Adelle Matlin... tell her we found her uncle. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  PHILADELPHIA GAZETTE BUILDING - EVENING 
The sea of desks are empty.  One empty desk is lit -- Kris Reddy's desk.  THE CRACKLE OF A SHORTWAVE/C.B. UNIT FLOATS THROUGH THE LARGE UNOCCUPIED ROOM from an adjacent room.  The VOICES OF DALLY AND OFFICER GREY ARE DISTORTED BUT AUDIBLE. 
WE MOVE TO the back room to find Kris writing furiously in front of an elaborate C.B. setup. 
He jots down the words as fast as they're said: 
"Maurice Parker... Elkhart... Route 80... Precinct 18..." 
The transmission gets cut as the phone conversation ends. Kris quickly rolls the chair across the room and grabs a map off the shelf. 
The map gets pinned under two coffee cups and a ceramic frog as Kris traces the route from Philadelphia to Indiana... He sits up straight in astonishment as his eyes hit the KEY of the map. 
KRIS Jesus -- he's walked six hundred miles. 
Kris glances at the hairs on his arm and smiles. 
CUT TO: 
LATER 
Kris at his computer and in the 'zone.'  Fingers flying over the keys passionately.  On his desk is a cardboard box filled with letters all shapes and sizes on the verge of overflowing the top of the box.  One the side of the box are the words, "Labor of Love - Fan Mail." 
CUT TO: 
INT.  INDIANA POLICE STATION - MORNING 
DAWN IN INDIANA -- the sun spills over the horizon. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  INDIANA POLICE STATION - MORNING 
Maurice and Officer Grey are seated on the front stairs of the precinct drinking coffee when ADELLE MATLIN DRIVES UP. 
Adelle steps out of a RENTED TOYOTA CELICA.  Her tense -- frightened eyes betray her mental state for the past ten hours.  She walks to the stairs. 
GREY Mrs. Matlin... good morning. 
Maurice slowly gets up.  Adelle is in shock as she looks at the stranger before her. 
Maurice stands in a 'COLTS' football T-shirt, faded jeans and sneakers.  His left cheek is black and blue, and his arm and side are bandaged. 
ADELLE Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers? 
MAURICE High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty. 
Adelle wasn't sure what that meant.  She shakes it off and hugs Maurice.  She is visibly relieved to have him in her arms. 
GREY My shift ended an hour ago. 
Adelle notices the ROSE in Grey's hand.  Grey catches her glance. 
GREY It's for my wife. 
ADELLE What's the occasion? 
Grey looks to Maurice -- they exchange a knowing smile. 
Maurice's dull eyes are about to shut when something catches his attention.  He sits up and stares out the window with great intensity.  Maurice watches as a large truck pulls into the parking lot, across it's side in blazing red --

Maurice scans the area... gas station ATTENDANTS... A BEARDED HOMELESS MAN laying next to a heating unit... KIDS eating fast food on old picnic tables... 
Maurice's gaze steadies on the TRUCK, as the driver fills the tank with gas.

A PHONE BOOTH INSIDE THE CONVENIENCE STORE 
Adelle is on the phone. 
ADELLE We'll figure everything out when we get there... Oh, he's going to need a lot of help with this... He wasn't even going to come with me, I had to tell him that he could do the walk later if he plans well... I know, but by that time I'll have gotten him some treatment... I just want to get back home before he changes his mind. 
CUT TO: 
CAR - LATER 
Adelle gets in the front seat of the car keeping the bag of food on the passenger seat.  She starts the car as she talks into the rearview mirror. 
ADELLE You want something to eat? 
She stares at Maurice covered in a blanket with his back to her... an unresponsive blob. 
ADELLE I know you're feeling a lot of emotions right now.  It's okay to be mad.  It's okay to feel helpless.  It's part of the healing process.  I understand.  I do. 
Adelle puts the Celica into drive and pulls out onto the highway. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  ADELLE'S HOUSE - EVENING 
Evening in Philadelphia.  The rented Toyota Celica pulls into the driveway.  The front door of the house opens.  Gerald walks out to greet them. 
A tired Adelle slips out of the car and hugs Gerald. 
ADELLE He was exhausted -- slept the whole way. 
Adelle and Gerald move to the back door of the Celica.  They open it and stare at Maurice covered by the blanket.  Adelle shakes the blanket. 
ADELLE Uncle Maurice we're home... Uncle Maurice. 
Adelle shakes Maurice, who stirs a little as he wakes.  His feet slide out from under the blanket -- Adelle stares curiously at the ARMY COMBAT BOOTS that dangle out. 
ADELLE Uncle Maurice? 
Adelle pulls aside the covers... THE HOMELESS MAN, from the gas station, sits up.  ADELLE'S SHRILL SCREAM BLASTS THROUGH THE AIR.  Gerald and Adelle stumble back as the large, bearded man struggles out of the car and looks around the quiet neighborhood. 
HOMELESS MAN So this is the City of Brotherly Love. 
The homeless man raises his hand.  He holds up MAURICE'S WELL POLISHED BOOK SOCIETY MEDALLION and kisses it lovingly. 
Adelle and Gerald stare back speechless.

EXT.  ROAD - MORNING 
Maurice back on the road.  His limp only slightly visible at this point in the day.  The bandages rubbing him with every step. 
The highway takes him around a beautiful bend of trees.  THE AIR IS FILLED WITH THE SOUNDS OF BIRDS.  Maurice spots a YELLOW WARBLER, a striking bird about eight inches long with vivid yellow feathers.  It sits elegantly on a nearby branch. He walks towards it -- it stays in position.  Closer.  The bird chirps back at him.  Maurice is within arms reach of the bird. 
MAURICE Ellen would have loved you. 
Maurice looks closer -- and notices it's wings.  The feathers bend back -- a dark area at the center. 
MAURICE How did that happen? 
Maurice watches the bird hop around the branch -- unable to fly.

INT.  PARKER KITCHEN - FIFTEEN YEARS EARLIER (FLASHBACK) 
The kitchen is a different color.  The refrigerator and appliances are brand new.  Ellen walks in -- something cradled in her hand.  Maurice looks up from his paper to see Ellen move to the sink and lay a motionless bird on the counter. 
ELLEN (shaky voice) It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken. 
MAURICE Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases. 
Ellen finds an eye dropper from the table and fills it with water -- she lets a few drops fall into the birds mouth. 
CUT TO: 
BEDROOM 
Evening, just before bed.  Maurice is reading.  Ellen is monitoring the bird closely.  It lays on the bedside table -- wrapped gently with a hand towel.  A morsel of food is lowered into its mouth with a pair of tweezers.  The bird stares blankly at the ceiling. 
MAURICE It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly. 
Maurice rests on an abandoned tractor by the side of the road and watches the wind change the fields.  He closes his jacket as the gusts become stronger. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
HOTEL 
The clock clicks past 11:30 am.  Maurice is still in bed -- the curtains drawn.  He crawls out from under the sheets and downs two pills with a glass of water.  He looks bad.  His face pale, his eyes at half-mast.  He wipes unnatural sweat from his brow and melts into the bed again. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
STREET 
Just after dusk.  A small town's main road.  Maurice quietly passes under the street lights. 
He stares up and tightens the hood on his parka as the first SNOWFLAKE falls into the SHAFT OF THE STREET LIGHT.  Soon thousands of flakes fall into the light... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
GAZETTE BUILDING 
Kris fields calls frantically as the LIGHTS BLINK ANXIOUSLY on his phone.  The front page of the Gazette is posted on his pin up board.  It reads... "HE MARCHES ON..."  Underneath is A PICTURE of Maurice standing outside his bookstore holding up THE BOOK SOCIETY MEDALLION proudly. 
A teenage boy gets off the elevator and maneuvers an enormous bag over his shoulder... emblazoned across his back are the words "MAIL ROOM."  The boy comes to Kris and empties the bag on Kris' desk without a word.  Hundreds of letters cascade down swallowing the table top and covering Kris who stares in awe as the letters keep coming. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
MOTEL 
Maurice is COUGHING PAINFULLY.  He crouches over the edge of the bed and holds his side with every strain. 
Maurice looks worse than ever.  His hair and shirt are soaked with sweat.  The coughing attack stops.  Maurice take a couple deep breaths before laying back down. 
His feet are visible -- sticking out from beneath the sheets. They look like someone has beaten them with a stick, swollen and bruised.  They disappear under the sheets.

CUT TO: 
EXT.  STREET - DAY 
Early morning.  The branches of the trees are encapsulated in ice.  The snow piled ten inches on every surface.  Maurice, buried deep beneath three layers of clothes, looks around. His breath materializes with every step.  He forces a weak smile at the magical landscape before him.  White.  Pure. Peaceful. 
The SOUNDS OF A VOLVO STATION WAGON urges Maurice to the side of the road.  As it passes a little girl waves from the passenger window.  Maurice puts on a brave face and waves back. 
Another CAR ENTERS the picture -- A DARK BLUE FIREBIRD rises over the hill in the opposite lane moving fast, too fast. 
SLOW-MOTION as the Firebird skids over the ice and the snow -- the driver desperately trying to gain control... The mother in the Volvo hits the BRAKES as the Firebird spins into her lane... Maurice yells out. 
MAURICE No! 
The cars IMPACT with a sickening CRUNCH -- BACK TO REAL TIME: 
The Firebird spins into a guardrail, breaking through it and coming to a stop in a bank of snow. 
The Volvo isn't so lucky.  It flips from the impact... sliding on its roof, driving through the snow, down the road... It comes to a rest a hundred feet away. 
SILENCE.  STILLNESS.  The entire event took only seconds. 
Maurice runs frantically after the Volvo.  The windows are SHATTERED.  Snow has packed into the over-turned car.  No one can be seen inside the vehicle. 
Maurice kneels down and punctures the wall of snow with his hand.  His arm disappears up to the shoulder.  His face grimacing with the strain.  His arm comes out slowly... 
A few MUFFLED SOBS ARE HEARD BEFORE the little girl breaks through the wall of snow and slides out of the window.  She lets out a DESPERATE GASP for air as Maurice pulls her out by the wrist. 
Maurice clears her mouth and face and watches as she coughs. 
MAURICE (panting) It's okay.  It's all over. 
Maurice lays her gently against a snow bank, before moving to the other side of the car. 
DRIVER (O.S.) Is she okay? 
Maurice looks up to see the driver of the Firebird walking towards him.  He looks dazed. 
Maurice doesn't waste another second and plunges his arm in the snow... deeper than before.  His cheek pressed against the snow, almost laying flat on the ground. 
MAURICE (frantic) Oh no... she's wearing a seat-belt. 
Maurice fishes around... his teeth clenched... He lets out a POWERFUL GRUNT as he pulls back with all his strength -- a woman's WRIST appears first, then the tangled hair and then the body spills out onto the road next to Maurice. 
The driver appears over the Woman and Maurice and loses it when he sees them. 
DRIVER It wasn't my fault.  It wasn't my fault. 
Maurice, out of breath, clears the woman's face and mouth -- no movement.  No sound. 
MAURICE Come on... please... 
Maurice holds her nose and breaths into her mouth... 
MAURICE Please... 
That makes Tandy think. 
HANSEN If he's clean, he'll never know about it. 
Tandy looks to the men's bathroom door. 
TANDY Do it quick. 
Hansen instantly reaches over and begins rummaging through the shoulder bag.  Hansen pulls out a little folder.  He opens the folder to reveal an old certificate.  Hansen shows Tandy the worn piece of paper. 
HANSEN A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around? 
TANDY Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why? 
Hansen returns the certificate and folder to the bag and leaves the booth quickly.

Dally zips his coat. 
CLERK It's the Nebraska state police. 
DALLY Nebraska?

Kris practically falls over.  Michelle scribbles down more quotes. 
MICHELLE This story is big huh? 
KRIS Mammoth. 
MICHELLE The Gazette's small huh? 
Beat. 
MAURICE Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult. 
FATHER I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now. 
This is the father's own room.  Very sparse as one would expect.  He moves to his bureau and retrieves some pills. 
FATHER Take these, and if you're up to it, try to explain how it is you came to be sitting here. 
Maurice follows the father's instructions and tightens the blanket around his shoulders. 
MAURICE I'm walking for my wife. 
Beat. 
FATHER To where? 
MAURICE Pacifica, California. 
FATHER From where? 
MAURICE Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
FATHER I see. 
Beat.  The father nods as if this is not shocking news. 
FATHER Why? 
MAURICE Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death? 
FATHER Most certainly. 
MAURICE And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them. 
FATHER That's a reasonable assumption. 
MAURICE I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts. 
FATHER Doubts?  About what? 
MAURICE About my love for her. 
The father nods with understanding as if everything became very clear with that statement. 
FATHER You don't have to prove anything to her. 
MAURICE I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can. 
The father studies this stranger before him with great admiration. 
MAURICE There are some people, including those officers, that are trying to stop me.  They mean well.  But they don't understand.  I wouldn't either if I were them. 
Maurice struggles with the last words.  He slumps back -- physically drained. 
The father gets up and takes the empty glass of water from Maurice's hands. 
FATHER I want you to stay here a few days until you're better.  You're no use to your wife in this condition. 
The father moves for the curtain. 
MAURICE You think I'm crazy too. 
The father turns and smiles warmly. 
FATHER I have spent my life dedicated to love.  Love of God.  Love of humanity.  And here you are living through love.  Bathing in it. Using its strength, its magic, its ability to overcome any barrier... If you are crazy, I hope my insanity is not far off. 
Maurice's eyes well up instantly.

RESTAURANT 
We are looking inside a fancy Center-City Philadelphia restaurant.  Adelle and Gerald are seated by an enormous bay window.  A waiter comes to their table with their main course.  Gerald watches the food being served with great anticipation. 
Gerald's eyes drift out the window to the magazine stand on the sidewalk... He squints to see better.  Realization hits hard... His eyes light up.  He looks to Adelle and back to the magazine stand. 
In a mad race for time, Gerald begins to devour the food on his plate.  The waiter and Adelle watch him in shock.  Adelle glances out the window.  Her eyes squint... then light up. She jumps to her feet and grabs Gerald by the arm, a fork full of food drops to his plate.  Gerald looks back at his full plate longingly as Adelle pulls him out of the restaurant. 
The waiter looks out the window to the magazine stand.  He squints.

The NEW YORK TIMES are hung like stockings around the border of the stand.  On the front pages, a singular headline stands out among the others: 
Maurice looks at her oddly.  MR. CALDWELL comes to the door; his face lights up. 
MRS. CALDWELL This is Maurice Parker -- the one walking for his wife. 
Mr. Caldwell is completely floored.  So, for that matter is Maurice.  Mr. Caldwell puts out his hand with awe. 
MR. CALDWELL If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here. 
MAURICE Evening News? 
MR. CALDWELL We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times. 
Maurice is truly surprised. 
MAURICE New York Times?

Maurice checks himself out in the mirror... his borrowed pajamas fit nicely. 
He moves to the window and stares at the moon lit landscape... enormous, endless, dwarfing. 
The rocking chair CREAKS as Maurice melts into it.  He rubs his calves slowly, the pain evident in his face.  His head leans back after a moment... on the verge of sleep. 
The SOUND OF TINY FOOTSTEPS stirs him.  He looks to the doorway to find Isaac standing quietly at the door in his baseball P.J.s. 
MAURICE I thought you were asleep. 
ISAAC You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up. 
Isaac walks silently to Maurice... Tip-toeing all the way. 
MAURICE Your parents would want you to be in bed. 
ISAAC You tell stories? 
MAURICE Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact... 
Too late.  Isaac climbs up into Maurice's lap with great effort.  Maurice looks down at Isaac who waits patiently for him to begin. 
MAURICE I would be exceedingly boring. 
Isaac waits. 
MAURICE I don't do these type of things. 
Isaac -- still waiting. 
MAURICE See there are two kinds of people in this world. (beat) ... Just a short one okay? 
Isaac gets in position, cradled in Maurice's arms.  Maurice searches for something to say. 
MAURICE There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove. 
ISAAC You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run. 
MAURICE Who's telling this story? 
Isaac points to Maurice. 
MAURICE Good, now the team had this great big player -- Big Billy.  He was the best.  He had them in the World Super-Bowl-Championship of little kids baseball.  But right before the game, the second best player on the team was suspended because he played a prank on a nice man who owned a book store... When that boy grew up he was convicted on burglary charges and spent fifteen years in prison -- where he belongs. 
Isaac didn't understand that last part. 
MAURICE Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove. 
ISAAC (beaming) That's me. 
MAURICE Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game... 
ISAAC Nine. 
MAURICE Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end. 
ISAAC You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again. 
Maurice has to smile as Isaac looks up anxiously. 
MAURICE There was a boy named Isaac who liked to play baseball... 
WE BACK OUT as Maurice rocks back and forth in his chair. Isaac falling asleep in his arms.

Maurice's face filled with strength.  He grins through the pain. 
MAURICE I'm fine.

MAURICE No thank you.

DRIVER You by yourself? 
Beat. 
MAURICE No. 
This pacifies the driver somewhat.  He nods and gets in the car.  Maurice watches as the car pulls away. 
He turns back to the guardrail -- the eagle is gone.  Maurice looks up into the sky.  The Golden Eagle is flying overhead... a tiny dot against the blazing sun. 
Maurice struggles to his feet using the guardrail as support. Maurice takes his first step...

STEPHANIE There are a lot of people worried about you. 
MAURICE (softly) Where am I? 
STEPHANIE In a hospital. 
MAURICE Which hospital?  Did you take me back?

Maurice looks across to ADELLE AND GERALD. 
MAURICE Are you two planning kids? 
ADELLE Maybe later. 
MAURICE You should definitely have children.  They're really special. 
Adelle and Gerald are in shock.  Maurice forks another fish stick with a smile. 
ADELLE I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle. 
MAURICE How serious is it? 
DR. RAY, who has been standing by the window listening, steps forward. 
DR. RAY You have two broken ribs, a punctured spleen and Acute Rheumatoid Arthritis. 
A colorful canopy of leaves... a familiar torn American flag. Stephanie's white VW Rabbit pulls to a stop. 
MAURICE This is it... This is where I fell. 
He turns back to Stephanie who stares back at him emotionally. 
STEPHANIE I never thanked my father.  He did so much for me... I never thanked him. 
Maurice holds her sad face in his scared hands. 
MAURICE (whispering) It's not too late. 
Maurice gets out of the car painfully slow.  He pulls his shoulder back upright with a laborious breath.  A sense of pride returns to his face.  He turns back to Stephanie and catches a horrified look.  He follows her stare... 
She is staring at his shirt... He looks down to see a DARK CRIMSON STAIN GROWING beneath the surface.  He covers the area with his hand. 
MAURICE You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back. 
STEPHANIE Someone should be with you.

Adelle YELLS at Dr. Ray, a few nurses, and the guard who was on duty. 
ADELLE ... "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychological Review", and "Science", so I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid. 
She catches her breath. 
ADELLE How does a grown man who can barely walk, just stroll out?... This is not James Bond here, this is my uncle who owns a bookstore, and gets outwitted by grade school kids pulling pranks! 
Adelle notices the new people in the room. 
NEWTON Mrs. Matlin, this is Sergeant Emory.  He'll help us find your uncle. 
Adelle walks up to Emory. 
ADELLE Let me tell you a story Sergeant. There was a patient of mine who had a Golden Retriever, Mac... She loved Mac, not like a pet, but like a family member.  One day, she had to leave Mac with 'friends', and wouldn't you know it, Mac gets away and ends up falling into a sewer. My patient comes back -- goes nuts when she hears that Mac has been in the sewer for over 48 hours. Apparently the cop who found the dog didn't want to get his pants dirty.  And neither did anyone else.  So of course, my patient decides to go in after it... she falls... breaks her hip and lands next to her dead dog, who died of toxic fumes down there... 
Adelle looks around at all the engrossed faces. 
ADELLE The moral of the story is... She sued for a lot of money!  She sued the friends, the city, and the officer for negligence on duty. She has no Mac, no happiness, but she's very rich now... That was a dog.  We're talking about a human being... (beat) I hope everyone clearly understands the chain of events that will occur if something should happen to my uncle, whom I love more than you can possibly imagine... Now Sergeant I would like to know right now, if you're willing to get your pants dirty for my uncle? 
Adelle and Emory have a staring contest.  Adelle wins. Adelle stands alone in a room with four men, and she is clearly the one in charge. 
The door flies open.  A police officer walks in pushing KRIS REDDY through the door. 
OFFICER I found him sneaking up the back stairs with this. 
The officer holds out a long coat and hat.  Emory walks up to Kris. 
EMORY Did you help Mr. Parker leave this hospital? 
Kris looks to the empty bed and smiles... a BIG SMILE. 
KRIS No... But I was going to. 
Beat.  Emory turns to the officer and ushers him to the door. 
EMORY Forget him.  It's time to get our pants dirty. 
Adelle smiles. 
EMORY I want three black and whites from here to Handley Avenue.  And no communication with the station. The press monitors the transmissions. 
KRIS (a born actor) They can do that? 
EMORY That goes for all of you.  Not a word about this disappearance to anyone.  Absolutely no press. 
Kris smiles innocently.

EMORY Shit, get him in your car and take him to St. Vincents.

DAWSON (V.O.) You ever see that concert footage of the Doors, Sarg? 
Adelle and the room of officers look confused. 
EMORY What the hell are you talking about? 
DAWSON (V.O.) The Doors, the musical group.  I saw a documentary where the police stopped one of their concerts, snatched Jim Morrison right off the stage... the crowd went frickin nuts -- they tore up the place -- it turned into a war. (beat) ... I'm not stopping this concert by myself.  And there's no way you're getting backup here -- it's jammed up for miles. 
Emory is thinking fast. 
DAWSON (V.O.) Why don't we just let him finish Sarg? 
Beat.  Emory looks at Adelle's expectant face.  He talks into the C.B. without taking his eyes off her. 
EMORY How does he look? 
DAWSON (V.O.) Like shit.  He's bleeding heavily. He's having breathing problems and he's as pale as stone.  If he wasn't moving, I'd swear he was dead. 
Emory thinks.  He talks to the other officers in the room. 
EMORY Bring him in.  Now!  If he dies out there, who the hell knows what that crowd will do... (to himself) Let alone the Mayor. 
The room empties fast.  Emory talks to Adelle. 
EMORY He'll be in a hospital within a half an hour. 
Somehow, Adelle's face doesn't convey much confidence.

INT.  PACIFICA MALL - DAY 
The shops are empty.  The food court abandoned. 
Close to five hundred people are huddled at the center of the mall.  The HI-FI HOUSE has four large screen TV's in their bay windows and speakers on the outside of the doors to lure passing shoppers in. 
All four sets have the same program on -- A NEWSBREAK on Maurice Parker.  The crowd listening anxiously. 
TV ANCHOR ... He's headed West on Sharp Park Road... Witnesses describe him as seriously injured. 
A shock of concern shoots through the crowd. 
TV ANCHOR Lynn McCay and our Highway Cam -- has just spotted him... 
TV ANCHOR 3 (V.O.) ... A seven month odyssey through the heart of the country...

SERGEANT DALLY 
the police officer from Philadelphia who worked with Adelle. He listens with the rest of the precinct to a portable stereo on a windowsill.  The room is silent -- everyone hangs on the words coming from the speakers. 
RADIO D.J. 2 (V.O.) ... the power of the human spirit...

GERALD 
in a hotel room.  The TV FILLING THE ROOM WITH NEWS.  Gerald sits behind two large room-service carts of food.  He takes a big bite of a sandwich with an emotional smile to the television. 
TV ANCHOR 4 (V.O.) ... A life threatening condition, Transient Cerebral Ischemia...

ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL 
where STEPHANIE watches in the jam packed recreation room with about thirty patients watching a TV screen mounted high in the corner of the room.  Stephanie looks a mess, she's been crying for a while. 
TV ANCHOR 5 ... a journey he began by himself, will end with a family of millions at his side...

EXT.  STREET - DAY 
The BOISTEROUS crowd parts like a ripple effect as Maurice walks through.  The eyes fall emotionally on him as he stares down at the ground trying to keep moving. 
Maurice gasps harder now, his eyes stinging with drops of sweat falling from his brow.  People in the crowd cover their mouths in shock as they get a clear view of him... His shirt soaked on one side with blood, his entire body shaking with pain, and exhaustion, his face hollow and pale -- ghostly. 
Maurice stops in his tracks.  He looks up at a wooden sign, worn from the years of salt water air.  The sign reads: 
"PACIFICA BEACH - 1/2 MILE" 
Maurice's thoughts fade away from this place, this time...

EXT.  PHILADELPHIA - FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
WE ARE IN THE PARKER BEDROOM.  The lights are off.  The MOONLIGHT FROM THE WINDOWS BLANKETS Young Maurice and Young Ellen as they lay in bed.  Ellen is cradled in Maurice's arms.  She is awake and watching the shadows dance on the ceiling.  She speaks in whispers. 
ELLEN What do you think heaven is like? 
Maurice opens his eyes and stares at his beautiful wife. 
MAURICE I don't know. 
ELLEN I think it's a different place for each person. 
MAURICE Did you have a dream? 
Beat. 
ELLEN I know where my heaven is. 
MAURICE Where? 
ELLEN Pacifica, California. 
Maurice chuckles. 
MAURICE Why there? 
ELLEN When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be. 
Beat. 
ELLEN Maurice? 
MAURICE Yes. 
ELLEN If I die, you'll know where to look for me? 
MAURICE Go to sleep Ellen. 
ELLEN No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now? 
Beat. 
MAURICE (pacifying her) The beach of Pacifica, California. 
ELLEN Good. 
Beat. 
MAURICE Go to sleep Ellen. 
Ellen smiles as she cradles deeper into Maurice's arms. Husband and wife fall asleep together.

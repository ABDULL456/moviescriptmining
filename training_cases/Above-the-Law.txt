ABOVE THE LAW 
FADE IN: 1   TITLES SEQUENCE - MONTAGE WITH SCORE 
PHOTOGRAPHIC STILLS show us NICOLA TOSCANI as a city boy in various growing-up SHOTS, circa 1950's -- with street chums wearing a Wyatt Earp T-shirt, in a communion suit. Then: in his first qi, a youngster studying the martial arts; he grows, we see news clippings of him winning trophies, his name on contest posters, SHOTS of him in action. Then: Japan. Nico now in his teens, studying with real masters, being dumped on his butt, posing smiling beside Japanese martial artists, then himself as an instructor. Now: a few military uniforms enter the picture, we see security clearance documents with Nico's picture and name on them. Then Nico near draft age with an American friend NELSON FOX on some kind of training base. TITLES END. 
DISSOLVE TO: 2   EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Blowing through the roof of a dense jungle straight AT CAMERA, HELICOPTER ROTORS RISE to a DEAFENING PITCH. SUPER:  Viet - Cambodian Border, 1972. Jungle foliage whips in the fierce downdraft as -- 3   "HUEY" GUNSHIP with US Army markings becomes discernible. The chopper lowers toward a crude landing zone hacked out of the wilderness. We GLIMPSE Cambodian troops and several machine gun positions around the LZ. 4   EXT. JUNGLE - TWO ARMED AMERICANS - DAY watch from the edge of the landing zone. We recognize Nico and Fox, now in their twenties, dressed in the nonmilitary jungle attire that usually marks a CIA "spook." 
5   HELICOPTER touches down. THREE OLDER AMERICANS -- rough-looking, in their mid-thirties, all carrying some kind of medical bags -- disembark into the HOWLING ROTOR BLAST. They hit the ground nimbly, as if they've done it many times before. 
6   LEADER OF THREE 
wears a khaki cowboy hat and packs a pearl-handled .45. 7   NICO AND FOX 
don't know whether to react with laughter or uneasiness. 
FOX You ever see chemical interrogation before? 
Nico's eyes stay on the approaching "cowboy," KURT ZAGON, for whom he plainly feels an instant animosity. NICO These assholes are agency? 
8    NICO'S POV FOLLOWS the medical bag in the cowboy's hand. 
9    BACK TO FOX AND NICO FOX We're all C.I.A. But these guys are from a page that ain't on the map. 10   EXT. JUNGLE - LATE AFTERNOON Nico in the point,   leading Fox and the three CIT (Chemical Interrogation Team)   men down an unmarked, twisting trail. We see from Nico's   gait that he is athletic, a born leader and totally at home   in the jungle. 11   TRAIL - LATE AFTERNOON snakes along a ridge line, high enough to give us a view and let us know these guys are way out in the boonies. ZAGON How long till we're across the border? NICO We've been over for the past hour. The group continues along the ridge. 
CUT TO: 12   EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
The sky glows from nearby bomb attacks. 13   NICO 
listening hard -- and even sniffing the air -- glances back at Zagon, who stands impatiently, drawing on a cigarette. ZAGON What are you looking at, hotshot? 
NICO (indicates cigarette glow) Why don't you light a bonfire? 
Nico takes a step toward Zagon. NICO What the fuck does this have to do with military intelligence? ZAGON Your orders are 'assist and observe' cherry -- Zagon turns to face Nico -- 
FOX (to Nico) Back off, partner -- Zagon turns from Nico. He moves close to the second prisoner, close as a lover, displaying the blade in the lamplight. ZAGON (to second prisoner) I'm gonna start carving at your ankles. We'll throw your feet in that box right over there. Then I'm gonna take off your arms -- One of the CIT men yanks the prisoner's leg forward, clamping it to the ground with his hands. The prisoner still hasn't flinched. He seems as locked into this dance of death as Zagon. NICO (can't take much more) Fox -- FOX Shut up, Nico. 
ZAGON You can disappear as easy as this slope, kid -- 
Zagon starts for the prisoner. Here comes the blade. Suddenly -- Nico grabs Zagon's shoulder. Zagon spins with terrifying quickness, cocking the blade to slash at Nico. Before Zagon's blow even starts, Nico slams him with a ferocious elbow shot right under the jaw. Zagon literally comes off the ground, Nico's blow is so terrific. Zagon drops in an unconscious heap. In a flash the two other CIT men move to jump Nico. Smash! The second CIT man is swallowing his teeth. Fox leaps in the way of the third, shoves Nico out of the hooch -- 30   EXT. HOOCH - NIGHT 
Fox wrestles Nico away from the hooch -- 
FOX Are you crazy?!! (as Nico jerks free) What the fuck's the matter with you?!!! Nico is shaking with rage and fear. He takes several steps away from the hooch, then draws up abruptly. Nico pulls his .45 from his holster, pops the safety, starts back for the hooch -- FOX Nico! NICO I don't cap him now, he's gonna do me later. 
The last CIT man appears, gun drawn, in the hooch doorway. Fox grabs Nico, hauls him back again -- 
FOX I'll cover this. Get back to the L.Z. -- (as Nico resists) -- I'll fix it! Get out! Get the fuck outa here! The CIT man calls out to the Cambodian troops, in dialect, pointing at Nico. The soldiers start toward Nico, as if to seize him. Fox, too, starts yelling to the troops in dialect, apparently countermanding the orders of the CIT men. The troops, confused, hold up for a moment. 
FOX (to Nico) I'll call for a chopper... get outa here! 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                        8. 
Nico gives a last look, turns and takes off down the jungle trail. Fox seems abandoned. The DISTANT BOMBING CONTINUES. Nico disappears into the darkness. 
FADE TO BLACK. FADE IN ON: 
31   CHURCH STEEPLE - DAY 
TILT DOWN to reveal St. Elizabeth's, a huge parish church in an Italian/Latino neighborhood in Chicago. The church looks festive, we see a few formally-dressed people hurrying in, then a squad car pulls up. The cops run upstairs as if they're late -- 32   INT. ST. MARY'S - DAY 
A baptism in progress. Nico -- 15 years older than when we last saw him, is standing beside SARA, his lovely wife        * -- watching a 60-ish priest, FATHER GENARRO, finish the final ritual on Nico's infant son Julian. The priest straightens the baby's baptismal garment, tugging the cloth around the little fellow's crotch. Smiles from friends and relatives clustered proudly around. Several cops, some in uniform are amongst them. Nico grabs his son from Genarro with a theatrical protective motion, tugs up the little boy's garment, kisses him smack on the bare butt. Laughter from all as Nico holds the lad high and proud. He puts his arm around Sara.                                                  * 
33   EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY Huge trays of Italian delicacies are carried out into the sunlight by several "old country"-type women. Wine is poured from generous carafes. Friends and relatives are everywhere, laughing and enjoying themselves; apparently the party has come here straight from the church. Presents for the new baby are being opened by Nico's wife, Sara,        * and Nico's mother, ROSA. SARA                                   * Mama, look at this -- all done by hand. 
Sara lifts a cute baby outfit.                                 * ROSA Nico had one just like this.   Thank you, Cora. Cora, an aunt, proudly smiles. 
34   NICO 
Holding the baby. Realizes that his little son has pooped in his pants. He turns for help to Sara.                       * 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                           9. 
NICO I think we got a little problem here. 
SARA                                  * (winking at the women) I carried him for the last nine months, you take him for the next diaper. 
Assorted uncles and aunts watch with amusement as Nico tries awkwardly to deal with the problem. NICO (to all) That's what you get for not marrying a Sicilian. Sara lets Nico struggle a moment, then takes over.               * 
SARA                                     * My brave husband. He's not afraid of thieves and muggers, but he's terrified when his son poops in his pants. Toscani relatives look on with approval at the happy couple and their baby. 
35   ANOTHER PART OF BACK YARD Three Chicago cops, LUKICH and HENDERSON in plain clothes and LIEUTENANT STROZAH in uniform wolf some Italian goodies while eying the group of celebrating relatives. LUKICH (indicates Nico across the patio) Toscani holds the record... for havin' more relatives under federal indictment than any other cop in Chicago. 
NICO Mrs. Z. (tries to be light) Is this a way to act on the day of my son's baptism? The poor woman can't meet Nico's eyes. 
SARA                                * It's Lucy.   She's gone again. Nico glances from Sara to Rosa.                              * 
Mrs. Zingaro shakes her head, choked with pain. Nico holds her, looking over her shoulder toward Sara.            * NICO It's that kid from the bar on Damen? The one with the drugs? 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                          13. 
Sara doesn't know. Nico does.     He comforts Mrs. Zingaro   * another moment, then stands. 
NICO Listen to me, Mrs. Z. Are you listening? (as the woman nods miserably) I have to go to work now. But I'll come by tonight. You'll be at the bakery? MRS. ZINGARO Si, Nico. NICO We'll talk, okay? We'll find a way to take care of this. 
Nico kisses Mrs. Z. He takes Sara's hand in goodbye,         * starts for the door. 47   EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - DAY Festivities still in progress. Nico passes through, nodding, thanking people for coming, taking farewells. Jackson waits for him, glancing at her watch. 48   INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING Nico is driving.   Jackson checks in on the radio. JACKSON (into mike) Unit Ten Tango X-ray.    We're up and clear. 49   EXT. VARIOUS STREETS - UNMARKED CAR 
moves into the central city. 50   POV THROUGH CAR WINDOWS - STREETS - MOVING 
Bad-looking hombres on stoops, street corners. NICO (O.S.) I promised the Lieutenant, I'm gonna take care of you. Broken windows and lost kittens for your last week. WIDEN SHOT to include Nico and Jackson. 
JACKSON And then you're gonna come visit me in a nice, clean, air conditioned office -- 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                          14. 
51   EXT. STREET - BUCKSHOT'S LIQUORS - DAY                        * The unmarked car pulls up outside a liquor store and bar. 
52   INT. UNMARKED CAR as it parks. Jackson gives Nico a look:     "What are we stopping at this dive for"? 
NICO I gotta take a quick leak. Stay put. 
He gets out of the car, starts for the bar. 53   INT. BUCKSHOT'S LIQUORS - DAY                                 * 
Dim, smoke-choked, dangerous characters at the bar.    Nico enters. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                            15. 
His silk shirt and sport coat clash with the druggy, working- class attire of the bar's denizens. Hard faces check him out subtly, ignore him. Nico approaches the bartender, shows a photograph. The bartender (BAD DUDE) shakes his head. 
BAD DUDE                                 * Why the fuck don't you assholes                        * leave me alone?                                        * 
He continues mouthing off to Nico. Nico moves to one stool,     * then another; the same exchange is repeated. 54   FAVOR ONE PARTICULARLY TOUGH CUSTOMER                           * 
A hulking bruiser with an earring.   He watches as -- 55   NICO 
approaches him. Three ARMY JACKETS look up sullenly. Beefy arms, tattoos, greasy mustaches. NICO Gentlemen. One Jacket treats him like he doesn't exist, and begins to pick his nose. FIRST ARMY JACKET (to others) I thought this was a kosher bar. They didn't allow no pork in here. The two others snicker, then so does the rest of the bar. Nico holds out a photo of a young girl (Lucy). NICO You seen this girl? SECOND ARMY JACKET I seen the top of her head. NICO That's witty. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                        15A. 
Nico takes a step away, as if moving on to the next stool. From behind the bar, the bartender swings a          * sawed-off baseball bat into view. Other bodies move         * ominously toward Nico. Suddenly he spins and, in a move     * almost too quick to see, he kicks the entire stool right out of its floor socket. Beer bottles fly, bodies crash. Nico slams the First Jacket in the face so hard it looks like his nose has exploded. Blood sprays onto Nico's silk shirt. He hauls the Second Jacket upright, nails him with a shot that crushes three ribs. A savage elbow blasts the third, head over heels, out over the bar and careening into the sink. In three seconds 600 pounds of fat has been put in cold storage. The rest of the bar is on its feet. Four huge men confront Nico. Now five. Six. Seven. Nico's jacket and shirt are ripped, blood spat- tered; his eyes are like an animal's, daring the men -- 
NICO Come on.   Show me something. No one moves. 
LUCY Let him alone! He's beautiful! 
NICO Not when I get through with him. Nico lifts the Pimp by the throat, pins him to the wall. 
PIMP No, man, wait! I'll give you something! Something big! 
LUCY Please, Nico!    Don't! PIMP It's huge! I swear it! A shipment... coming in next Tuesday -- NICO Shipment, my ass. PIMP This is square! On my mother's soul! You can't send me up -- Nico glances to Lucy. Half of him wants to tear the Pimp apart, the other half doesn't want to make the poor girl's life any more tragic. Besides, he's a good cop -- and maybe this "shipment" is on the level. PIMP I heard it from a hooker friend of mine. She's banging some big coke lawyer, he told her. I swear to Jesus! 
Nico relents -- a little. NICO What lawyer? 
PIMP I don't know. (sees Nico doesn't believe him) That platinum chola... Carla DeCarlo... she knows. Nico tightens his grip on the Pimp's throat. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                          19.   * 
PIMP She got popped this afternoon. She's downtown. Red dress, lizard shoes -- 
60   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BAR - DAY Jackson looks up from the car to see Nico -- wild-haired, shirt ripped and bloody -- emerging from the adjacent apartment stoop, leading young Lucy, who's tear-streaked, wearing a torn dressing gown. Instantly, Jackson is out of the car, moving to Lucy. 
JACKSON It's okay, girl. Mama Jax is here. 
She wraps an arm around Lucy, helps her toward the car. 
JACKSON (to Nico) That was some leak you took. From the door of the bar, several bloodied heads peek. JACKSON Broken windows and lost pussy cats, huh. Jackson checks out her battered partner. 
JACKSON You're one crazy bastard, Toscani. Nico opens the rear door, helps Jackson ease Lucy in. 
NICO We'll get her some clothes and a bath. I'm not bringing her home to her grandmother like this. DISSOLVE TO: 
61   OMITTED 
63   EXT. ZINGARO BAKERY - DAY 
From the front seat of Nico's car emerges a tearful Lucy, in fresh clothes and looking miserably contrite. Nico walks her inside. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                         20.       * 
The Zingaro family is busy preparing for the night's baking. Grandpa and Grandma Zingaro leave their work and receive their waif-like granddaughter. With eyes watering they thank Nico. They disappear upstairs with Lucy. Jackson, standing in the doorway, has seen all this. 64   INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - DAY 
Nico at the wheel has just pulled away from the bakery. Jackson, in the passenger seat, studies her partner for a few moments, shaking her head at the contradictions in this man. Educated, classy, an elegant dresser -- yet underneath an out-and-out wild man. 
JACKSON I don't get you, Toscani. (beat) What the hell are you doing being a shitheel cop? With your background? For a long moment Nico says nothing.   Then, quietly, look- ing straight ahead: NICO When I was overseas, I saw some things. Things that eat your guts out. Things that stay in front of your eyes like they were burned in and branded. He turns to Jackson. NICO You can walk away from them, Jax. You can quit, but you know it's still going on. You try something anyway -- (smiles a moment) -- I know I'm not going to change the world. I can't stop the tonnage coming in, I can't fight the boys behind the desks pushing their buttons -- 
ANGLE INCLUDING MEAN STREETS OUTSIDE NICO But maybe here, huh? (indicates street) Maybe in my own city, my own neighborhood, on my own block -- maybe here I can do something. 
He turns a corner. NICO That's why I'm a shitheel cop. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                         20A.     * 
64A   INT. POLICE STATION - DAY Behind the desk, a few detectives man the phones.   A Latin attorney, ABANDANO, is at the counter. 
CHI CHI You were right, cabron.                            * 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                           24. 
One SHOT between the eyes and Nardo CRASHES backward into the WINE RACK, eyes wide with shock and bewilderment. Chi Chi SHOOTS him AGAIN; Nardo drops like a stone. Coolly, professionally, Chi Chi pumps FOUR more SHOTS into the prone busboy's head. Chi Chi ejects the clip into his palm, unscrews the silencer, holsters the gun. Salvano appears at the top of the stairs. Two busboys are behind him. One of them is the young pimp. The busboys hurry        * down, the pimp -- scared shitless but playing it macho-cool. * Salvano comes down the stairs. Chi Chi stands over his work. SALVANO (to busboys) Clean up this mess. CHI CHI                                  * Who knows who else is talking --                       * 
SALVANO                                  * He was a young fool.                                   * 76   BACK IN UPSTAIRS DINING ROOM Salvano and Chi Chi emerge from the basement steps and walk toward their booth. 
CHI CHI We're crazy waiting for this bullshit 'shipment.' Let me waste the other fucker now. 
Salvano puts a hand on Chi Chi's shoulder. SALVANO Be patient. This will be done the way it was planned. CUT TO: 
77   EXT. BODY AND FENDER SHOP - NIGHT Rusting cyclone fences surround   a mud-lot repair yard in a dingy industrial section. Young    Lation and black workers finish up for the night; through   the dirty, security-barred office window we can see Chi Chi   talking on the phone. The lawyer, Abandano, is also there. 
78   EXT. ALLEY - REAR OF SHOP - NIGHT 
Nico finishes connecting a small transmitter which has been hastily wired to the entering phone line. 
79   INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT 
Nico and Jackson in the shadows down the street from the body shop. Nico wears earphones, a small tape recorder on the seat beside him. Jackson does not look happy. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                          25. 
JACKSON Toscani, you're going to have me doing time. 
NICO Lighten up, Jax. No one's bringing this into court. 
JACKSON Except against us. NICO I don't give a shit how we do it. I just wanna get there. Jackson gives Nico a dirty look, but stifles her protest. 
JACKSON I thought you said you were gonna protect me. Cover my butt. Be my guardian angel -- Nico hears something through the earphones.    Gestures for silence -- 80   ANGLE THROUGH OFFICE WINDOW Chi Chi listens with increased intensity to something on the phone. He starts writing it down -- 81   BACK TO NICO In unmarked car.   He's writing it down too. NICO I got the shipment.                                  * JACKSON What?    What's he saying? 
NICO (scribbling furiously) '... Engine block has cleared customs. Serial number VA-748. Pick up Tuesday, 3 May as authorized.' 
82   EXT. BODY SHOP - NIGHT 
Chi Chi emerges from the office, tucking a scrap of paper into his pocket. Abandano follows. They get into a late-model Lincoln which pulls out onto the street.     * 
83   EXT. STREET - NIGHT Nico and Jackson's car follows at a discreet distance. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                           26. 
NICO (V.O.) Unit Ten Tango X-ray. I need a vehicle registration I.D. 
POLICE RADIO (V.O.) Go ahead, please. NICO (V.O.) '86 Lincoln.    Illinois 354 Dog '67.                * 
84   INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - NIGHT Jackson picks up Nico's pad to take down the response. After a moment: POLICE RADIO (V.O.) Vehicle registration follows. Leaseholder: Ramon Testamente, registered alien. Nation of origin: Venezuela. Do you wish criminal record search? NICO (into mike) I want to know when he wipes his                     * behind.                                              * 85   SERIES OF SHOTS As Nico and Jackson tail the Lincoln out of the industrial zone into a fancier, non-Latin neighborhood. On the sidewalks we glimpse theatergoers, fashionable white couples out on the town. 86   LINCOLN 
Pulls up to a valet park outside a ton-y restaurant.    A sign says: "BOGOTA."                                           * 
He speaks to the officers. AGENT NEELEY                            * What I'm about to say doesn't leave this room. Is that clear? Assent from everyone. 
AGENT NEELEY                            * Mr. Salvano has been working for some time in cooperation with certain federal agencies. 
134   CLOSE - NICO'S FACE Stunned and furious at this royal fuck-up. AGENT NEELEY (O.S.)                     * I'm not at liberty to divulge the nature of Mr. Salvano's involvement -- I just learned of its existence myself a few hours ago. But one thing I can tell you -- 135   BACK TO AGENT NEELEY                                            * 
AGENT NEELEY                            * Mr. Salvano's role is crucial to an extremely sensitive ongoing investigation. Any further surveillance, harassment, or unauthorized operations against this individual are forbidden. I must order you gentlemen -- (looking straight at Nico) -- with all respect for your work and your courage, to stand down. 
Lukich shakes his head; Nico is devastated.     Jackson takes it all in. 
CUT TO: 
136   INT. POLICE SQUAD ROOM - MORNING OPENING CLOSE ON a desk drawer being opened. Aside from rounds of ammo, notes and an aging eggplant parmigiana sandwich, there are half a dozen hand-labeled audio- cassettes and a small collection of miniaturized bugging devices. Jackson and Lukich watch Nico take out the notes, hand them to Lieutenant Strozah. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                         35. 
LIEUTENANT STROZAH The tapes too. 
NICO (mocking) That's my Lawrence Welk collection! 
LIEUTENANT STROZAH I want everything you got on this one. Reluctantly, Nico hands over the tapes.   The Lieutenant eyes the bugs and wires. LIEUTENANT STROZAH I know you don't give a shit about yourself, Toscani. (a glance to Jax) But you're gonna put Jackson's ass in a sling, too, with these illegal wires. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                         35A.    * 
136A   OTHER SIDE OF SQUAD ROOM Agent Halloran edges up to Jackson, who's grabbing coffee on the far side of the squad room, and watching from there as Nico gives Strozah more of a hard time. AGENT HALLORAN What's the story on your partner, Jackson? Did he learn this style or was he born with a brick up his ass? Jackson checks Halloran out. He's black too and, despite herself, there's a certain rapport. JACKSON He has ethics. Unlike certain others on this case. 
Halloran watches the illegal bugs and tapes come out of Nico's drawer. AGENT HALLORAN His 'ethics' are gonna cost him his badge and his gun. 
This "white" talk gives Jackson a pain.   She slips into her jive mode. JACKSON You don't wanna catch him without no gun. Halloran's look asks why not? JACKSON 'Cause what he do with his hands... make bullet holes look pretty. 
Across the room, Nico turns over the tapes. AGENT HALLORAN He bad? 
JACKSON Bad bad. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                          36. 
137   INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - STAIRWAY - DAY Nico and Jackson come down the stairs. Jackson has had ample excitement for her last week on the force. 
JACKSON Is that enough? Can we do something normal now -- like eat lunch? 
NICO Anything you say, Jax.   How about Salvano's? 
JACKSON Let it be, Nico. 
138   EXT. PRECINCT HOUSE - DAY 
Nico and Jackson's car pulls out into traffic. 139   INT. UNMARKED CAR - PARKED (ALLEY BEHIND SALVANO'S) Jackson and Nico are eating some fast good.   Nico reaches to his jacket pocket; takes out a cassette. 
JACKSON What... you kept his tape, too? Nico already has it in the PLAYER. We hear FRAGMENTS of the telephone tap from the body shop in Spanish and English. Jackson looks frustrated. Nico listens care- fully to what appears to be the taped PHONE CONVERSATION. NICO Poetry, ain't it? 140   EXT. REAR SALVANO'S RESTAURANT - DAY (POV FROM CAR) 
FATHER GENARRO Two nights ago. I didn't call the police.

Father Genarro knocks on the door, pauses, then knocks again. The door opens. A twelve-year-old who looks like he's from Central America stands in the doorway. 
FATHER GENARRO (in Spanish) It's all right, son. These are friends. 
The boy steps back and we MOVE INTO -- 154   INT. CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY 
A largish room, no exposed windows, everything boarded up. Newly-constructed makeshift toilet and shower in one corner, various cots. A number of LATIN REFUGEES -- families mostly -- react shyly as Father Genarro introduces Nico and Jackson. Sister Bonifacia is there, and a youthful priest, FATHER TOMASSINO. We will see both of them again. FATHER GENARRO (referring to the cops) These are friends. (to Nico) This is Father Tomassino. 
FATHER TOMASSINO How do you do? Nico shakes the young priest's hand. There is a moment between them as Nico meets Tomassino's eyes, liking what he sees. The refugees are relieved, however, when Father Genarro, Nico and Jackson take their leave. 155   NICO, JACKSON AND FATHER GENARRO 
continue down the hall. JACKSON I didn't know this church was a sanctuary, Father. FATHER GENARRO Yes. But, perhaps not such a safe one. NICO How long have they been here? 
FATHER GENARRO Too long. At least the kids can go to our school. 
NICO Who did it, Father? 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                 39A. 
FATHER GENARRO Kids, maybe. (significantly) Maybe worse. It's not the first time. JACKSON We can have a car check by, every hour. 
FATHER GENARRO No... please.    Police frighten these people. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                          40. 
156   INT. CHURCH - MAIN AISLE - DAY                              * The three are outside, taking their leave. A big smile and a hand on Father Genarro's shoulder. The priest is greatly relieved. NICO Really, I don't mind coming by. 
FATHER GENARRO Tell me, Nico... When was your last confession? 
NICO I'm a married man, Father.   I've got no sins to confess. 
FATHER GENARRO You're a police officer, you have many sins to confess. JACKSON Amen. Nico and Jackson start off. 
FATHER GENARRO (calls after Nico) You come back Sunday. I feel better when I see Nicola in church. (calls louder) You don't show, I'm phoning your mother! DISSOLVE TO: 157   SAME CHURCH - POV FROM WINDOW - EARLY MORNING (SUNDAY) 
HIGH ANGLE FROM ACROSS the street: neighborhood people dressed in their Sunday best fill the sidewalk, filing in for Mass. We hear an ORGAN from inside the church. 
158   VARIOUS ANGLES - CONGREGATION An Italian neighborhood becoming more Hispanic. As the churchgoers file in, we see families -- women, kids, babies. 
159   NICO, SARA, ROSA AND JULIAN                                 * are among the crowd, exchanging pleasantries with friends and neighbors -- in English, Italian and Spanish. 
160   INT. CHURCH - SIDE AISLE Sara, holding Julian, slips into a pew. As Nico and Rosa    * follow, Father Genarro passes, heading for the front. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                             41. 
ROSA Father Genarro! I have you to thank for getting my son back into church! 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                           43. 
ROSA (in Italian) Help the others! Help them, Nico! 
CUT TO: 173   STATUE OF JESUS 
Splattered with real blood. 
CUT BACK TO: 174   ANGLE ON CONGREGATION 
Everyone is down, reeling from the concussion, dust and smoke. Nico rises alone from this scene. 
NICO (forcefully) Help each other move outside.   Be calm. 175   EXT. SIDE OF CHURCH - MORNING From a doorway and a shattered window smoke pours forth. We hear SCREAMS from inside. 176   INT. CHURCH Nico on his feet, plainly the leader in this moment of terror. Worshippers, shattered and bleeding, pour past him toward the door. Nico grabs a stout-looking church- goer. NICO Call 911. Tell 'em to send everything they got! (turns to his wife) Sara, get the baby and Mama                        * outside. Nico starts for the altar where the damage is worst. 
177   EXT. FRONT OF CHURCH - MORNING The congregation streams out in terror-stricken disarray. We see Nico's family -- they're all right. 
178   NICO appears from the church, carrying a young choir girl. He hands the child over to two older women, races back into the church. 
179   LONG SHOT - STREET OUTSIDE CHURCH The first paramedic van comes speeding around the corner, SIREN BLARING. Police cars appear right behind -- 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                            44. 
180   INT. CHURCH Nico appears through the backlit smoke and kneels over the bloodied body of Father Genarro. He desperately tries to maintain the priest's life. CUT TO: 
181   INT. HOSPITAL/ICU WARD - AFTERNOON 
The aftermath of the blast. Doctors and nurses have the scene more of less under control, but there's still plenty of pain and misery. 
182   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON Nico stands, his back to the wall -- a scary, blank look on his face. A doctor and several nurses are pulling the plugs on the terribly mutilated body of Father Genarro. A nun is crying; a fellow priest is blessing the Father. 183   JACKSON arrives.   Nico talks to her, aside. NICO I want a list of everyone that's been treated here today. Everyone. JACKSON Right. NICO Then find those sanctuary people, the ones we saw in the church basement -- As Jackson makes notes. 
NICO Find out where they're from, why anyone would want to harm them. 
Jackson flips her notepad shut, ready to go. JACKSON Where are you gonna be? 
NICO Just stay near a radio.   I'll find you. 
184   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NICO'S MOTHER (ROSA) - AFTERNOON 
Sits on a bench with a bandage over one eye. Sara             * and Julian are sleeping beside her. Nico kneels beside his mother, deeply concerned. Nico takes his mother's arm, helps her to her feet. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                        45. 
Sara wakes and picks up Julian. Mama knows Father Genarro     * has died. She begins sobbing softly. Other members of the congregation are in the hallway, mourning. Nico, with his family, takes several steps toward the exit. Suddenly, Nico stops. He sees Agent Neeley entering (the FBI man who    * ordered him off the case) accompanied by Lieutenant Strozah   * and two uniformed officers. 
NICO Sara... go down to the car; I'll                    * be with you in a minute. He hails Neeley.                                              * 
NICO I need to talk to you. (a glance to Strozah and others) ... Alone. Neeley nods. Nico leads him off the corridor, through a       * fire exit door -- 185   STAIRWELL LANDING The door closes behind them. Nico and the FBI man are alone on the stairway landing. AGENT NEELEY                          * (impatient) What the hell is it, Toscani? Without warning, Nico grabs Neeley by both lapels, slams      * him furiously into the wall! NICO You.   That's what the hell it is! AGENT NEELEY                          * Get your goddam hands off me! Neeley tries to shake free; Nico won't let him.               * 
NICO You let Salvano walk. AGENT NEELEY                          * Salvano?! Are you crazy? (rips himself free) What does he have to do with this? NICO That was no cherry bomb in there. That was C-fucking-4! (struggles to master his rage) I've used that shit. (MORE) 
FIRST GIRL Fly, baby! 194   NICO 
tears after this human cannonball.   Amazingly, he's gaining -- 195   INT. BODEGA - DAY 
Machete Man highballs off the sidewalk, straight into a Mom and Pop groceria. Customers scatter in shock as the hood blasts past them, out the back door. Here comes Nico. Patrons curse in Spanish as he barrels past -- 
196   EXT. YARD BEHIND BODEGA - DAY Machete Man bolts from the bodega into a small patio with tables and chairs. He leaps the fence into the next yard, which belongs to a funeral home. He hurdles the headstone inventory, clambers up the fence on the far side -- 197   BACK TO NICCO pursuing along the same route. 198   MACHETE MAN 
claws his way to the top of the fence and onto a frame- work of two-by-fours which form an arbor-like canopy a- bove the third back yard. Plastic sheeting is tacked between the beams. Machete Man glances back at Nico, starts out -- tightrope-style -- across the two-by-fours. Nico reaches the fence behind the hood, starts also onto the two-by-fours. We hear FEMALE SCREAMS from below as the rickety structure starts to wobble precariously. Machete Man reaches the far side. A fire escape is ad- jacent; he grabs for it, starts up. Nico catches him by the ankle. The two crash together back onto the two-by- fours, which give way, sending them plunging into -- 
199   BACKYARD OF FLOWER SHOP - DAY Four young Oriental women, potting plants, react with terror as the two bodies CRASH through. Machete Man scrambles away from Nico but is trapped in the corner next to the rear shop door. The flower girls can't move either; Nico and the hood are too near the door. The girls retreat to the far corner, squealing in fright. 
MACHETE MAN (to Nico, in terror) No, hermano. Please -- 
Nico starts menacingly toward the hood, breathing hard from the chase. 
NICO Who put up the money? MACHETE MAN What money? 
Nico grabs him by the hair. NICO You didn't come after me for a piece of ass. (twists the youth's neck) Who paid you? 
MACHETE MAN I told ya!    No one! Nico slams him with a fierce shot to the ribs. The hood doubles over, gasping. The flower girls shriek even louder. Nico turns to the girls with a ferocious glare. NICO (shouting) Shut up! The girls instantly go silent in terror. Nico turns back to Machete Man, spins him violently face-down, jacking the punk's right arm straight out behind him. We see that Nico can break his elbow with one blow. NICO Give it to me! Nico raises his fist to strike. 
MACHETE MAN Jimmy Constanza! Nico shoves the hood into the ground, tearing the hood's wallet from his trouser pocket. Nico rips the wallet a- part, seizes the kid's identification and holds it up. He grabs the punk by the hair with his free hand. Machete Man is staring up in terror, wondering what this means. 
NICO If you're lying to me, I'll come and kill you right in your own fucking kitchen. 
Nico dumps him on the ground and walks away.    Instantly Machete Man changes his tune. MACHETE MAN Salvano!   Bautista Salvano! 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                            52. 
Nico walks back, his foot smashes into the punk's face. He hits the ground with a thud. 
NICO Gracias, muchacho. Nico walks away. 
200   MONTAGE WITH SCORE 
A)   INT. NICO'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT Nico at the kitchen table spread with notepads, old add- ress books, 3X5 cards. He's on the phone, impatient, apparently getting nowhere. He slams the phone down. B)   INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
Nico paces, phone cradled to ear, talking urgently. CLICK: he's been hung up on; he looks at the receiver in frustration and disgust. C)   CLOSE - CORKBOARD ON KITCHEN WALL Nico's hands pushpin a 3X5 card into the wall. 
D)   INSERT - 3X5 CARD We read: "FBI / Agent Smith / 11:53 / B.S. / Covering for who?" 
E)   KITCHEN - NIGHT Nico back at the table, listening to the wiretap tape, transcribing it. 
F)   ANOTHER ANGLE - KITCHEN - NIGHT (LATER) Nico holds Julian, goes over notes. 
G)   CLOSE - YELLOW LEGAL PAD The page is headed: "FATHER GENARRO." Below in doodle formation, are a series of boxes, each one containing a phrase. We read: "Father G had some- thing on Salvano?" "Church break-in?" "Drug infor- mation?" "Father G connected to FBI?" Irritably, Nico's pencil crosses everything out. 
201   SARA                                                            * Appears in a nightgown at the kitchen doorway.   She looks frail, frightened. MUSIC ENDS. 
NICO (to Sara,                                      * allowing himself to be frisked) It's all a mistake, Sara -- It's                      * gonna be all right. The cops steer Nico toward the door. 
SARA                                    * (calls after them) The Police Association's got lawyers for this, you bastards! 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                            57. 
Sara grabs for the phone; Nico is manhandled out the            * door -- 
212   EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT 
The neighbors are now on their porches.   Nico is led to a waiting unmarked car. 
CUT TO: 
213   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - LATE NIGHT Bad Dude, the bartender we remember from Nico's first visit to the Polish bar, finishes signing a deposition. A cop takes the paper. Bad Dude stands, glances half- fearfully, half-defiantly to Nico, who is led down a hall- way flanked by two uniformed officers. Agent Halloran opens the door for Bad Dude, who exits. 
214   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATE NIGHT Neeley, Halloran, Lieutenant Strozah and Deputy Superinten-     * dent JACK CROWDER. Halloran indicates a stack of                * depositions, tapes and notes on the table before Nico. AGENT HALLORAN Illegal wiretaps. Unauthorized surveillance. NICO When were you born, asshole? AGENT NEELEY                             * Associating with known felons. Disobeying direct orders -- 
NICO Where's Jackson? 
CROWDER                                  * She's outa this. AGENT HALLORAN You're the rotten apple in this barrel, Toscani. We don't have to look any farther than you and your 'family.' 
Nico comes out of his chair, going for Halloran.      Strozah tries to block him, but it's useless. LIEUTENANT STROZAH                       * Nico! You damn fool! You wanna go to prison?! Nico stops. He's speechless with rage.    His finger points toward Halloran like a loaded gun. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                           58. 
CROWDER                               * (indicates more depositions) Unlawful entry. Illegal search and seizure -- NICO (spits on papers) You'll never build a frame on this chickenshit. AGENT NEELEY                          * (angrily) You were ordered to back off on Salvano. But you had too big a hard-on for that, didn't you-- 
Nico contains his fury. He steps away from Strozah, with a gesture that says "I won't hurt you." NICO (to Strozah) Fred.   You can't be in on this. Nico faces his lieutenant -- a look that calls on long       * years of comradeship and loyalty. Strozah is torn. He's a good man, over his head in a situation he doesn't com- pletely understand. LIEUTENANT STROZAH                    * You're officially suspended, Toscani. I want your tin... and your iron. Neeley leans past Nico; drops Nico's gun (with an evidence   * tag on it) onto the table. Nico looks to Strozah, who averts his eyes. Nico flips his badge onto the table. NICO You holding me? 
AGENT NEELEY                          * You can walk for now. But don't walk far. 
CUT TO: 215   EXT. PHONE BOOTH ON DOWNTOWN STREET - DAWN

CUT TO: 216    EXT. STREET - NICO, JACKSON AND LUKICH - DAWN A mood of urgency. JACKSON -- I found the sanctuary people. (MORE) 
Nico and Jackson come out.   Nico has made a decision. NICO You're outa this, Jax.    Go home. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                             63. 
JACKSON (displays her notes) You see this list? Well, I'm not done. 
Nico admires his partner's guts, but he's worried. JACKSON I'm not a rookie, Toscani. Now, go home. Get your family out of here. Nico agrees.    The pair starts to split. 
NICO (calls after Jackson) Just paperwork, you understand? 
CUT TO: 219   INT. NICO'S CAR - MOVING - MORNING Nico drives, a jumble of emotions on his face.      Urgency fear, exhaustion. He's deep in thought -- 
220   EXT. INTERSECTION - MORNING Nico's car pulls up at a stop light. He looks around without really seeing. An old lady pulls a shopping cart       * while a crossing guard takes some kids across the street.      * 221   ANOTHER CAR ROARS up out of nowhere, without two men inside, SCREECH- ING to a stop head-on to Nico's door. Its doors spring open -- 222   NICO 
dives toward his own passenger door -- 223   SECOND CAR - TWO MORE ARMED MEN 
leap out, OPEN FIRE with pistols and automatic weapons. 224   QUICK CUTS 
Nico's car riddled with a furious FUSILLADE.      WINDOWS BLOW OUT; the driver's door is shredded -- 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                          64. 
225   NICO - ON FLOORBOARD crawling frantically; shoving the passenger door open as a FIRESTORM of lead and FLYING GLASS BLAZES all around him. 226   FOUR MEN 
FIRING point blank (6 to ten feet) into Nico's car.   The men are cool, professional. 227   NICO 
spills from the passenger door onto the ground, scrambles like mad under his own car toward one of the attackers' cars. 228   PEDESTRIANS AROUND INTERSECTION 
scream and scatter in terror. 229   FOUR MEN FIRING as shells spew from the ejection ports of their weapons. 230   NICO'S CAR being chewed to pieces -- 231   NICO - UNDER MEN'S CAR                                          * 
crawling at full speed from the car's front to its back. On the ground, alongside the car, spent CARTRIDGE CASES RAIN like hailstones. 232   FOUR MEN As their magazines empty. The last shells spring free, GUN BARRELS SIZZLE, blue smoke fills the air. The leader waves two men forward to check their kill. At that instant: 233   NICO 
springs to his feet behind the men, the Sig Saur .45            * clutched in both hands. (He has crawled under both cars to envelop his attackers.) 
NICO Over here, you sons-a-bitches! Nico's rage is superhuman. The men stare in conster- nation. One of the men has a fresh magazine half into his weapon -- 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                        65. 
NICO (eyes like an animal) Try it. Be my guest. 
The man lets the magazine clatter to the street. The others raise their hands. It takes all Nico's strength to keep from wasting all four of them on the spot. His gaze swings wildly around the intersection. He spots a corner grocery store. A phone inside. NICO (gestures with gun) Over there! Move it! -- Now!! The men are scared shitless. They put their hands in back of their heads; trot jelly-legged -- 
234   INT. CORNER GROCERY STORE - DAY A Pakistani counter clerk takes one look at the mob enter- ing his store and bolts for the rear. A customer exits as Nico herds his captives in. NICO Hands on the counter! Three men do it; the fourth is slow. NICO Don't tempt me, ASSHOLE -- The fourth obeys. Nico moves to the pay phone on the wall, covering the men with his .45. He grabs the re-         * ceiver in his free hand; tries to dial. Adrenaline makes his hand shake; the dials spin wrong -- One of the men sees Nico's dilemma. To hit 911, Nico has to take his eye momentarily off his captives. As Nico turns again to the dial -- A free-standing sales display hurtles toward him, crashing into his gun hand. One of the men has lunged into the display; now he dives atop Nico a second later. The whole human pile crashes, thundering into a glass freezer. Somehow Nico gets to his feet. One of the men grabs Nico's gun; Nico swings one of the freezer doors -- Wham! -- smack into the man's face. The GLASS SHATTERS; the man drops like a rock. Now it's three against one -- prime odds for Nico. He wades into his attackers. A coffee stand goes flying. A body sails into a makeup display. One fool is lucky enough to land a blow that bloodies Nico's nose; he pays with a shattered forearm and a head-first heave into an ice cream locker --

255   ANGLE - CORRIDOR 
The two walk past floor-to-ceiling warehouse shelves, packed with labeled boxes, film cans, etc. which are visible through a heavy wire-mesh screen.

256   ADMINISTRATIVE WINDOW A pot-bellied, Naval-retired-type CLERK looks up from his desk as Nico and Neeley come up to the counter. We see a      * sign: "EVIDENCE HOLDING DEPOT -- You MUST Have Your Requi- sition Number!!!" The Clerk stands, chomping a cigar, wad- dles to the counter. We see his arms covered with tattoos. 
CLERK What can I do for you, lads? Neeley presents his ID.                                       *

H)   INT. CONVENTION CENTER - COMPUTER BOOTH - DAY Nico in the crowd in front of the booth of a Japanese computer manufacturer. Dr. Watanabe (Nico's friend whom we remember from the baptism/picnic scene) is the chief engineer at the booth, showing off some high-tech equipment to several brainy looking executives. Watanabe glances up, spots Nico. Nico makes a subtle sign to indicate he must speak to Watanabe. Watanabe crosses at once to Nico. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                           73A. 
WATANABE So good to see you again, sir! (shakes Nico's hand) Come back near closing... five- thirty... we'll place your order then. Nico nods, fades like a shadow into the throng.     MUSIC DOWN, SEQUENCE ENDS -- 
DISSOLVE TO: 262   INT. CONVENTION CENTER - NIGHT 
All customers gone, lights being turned off. Janitors sweep up, the last booth people shut down for the night. 
WATANABE 
emerges with Nico from behind a booth divider, leads her        * old friend at a brisk pace across the deserted floor. NICO Listen, Wat... you know I wouldn't call in a favor -- 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                        74.        * 
WATANABE Of course not. Just because you kept a few 'friendly' tribesmen from cutting my heart out and serving it up as Pad Thai? With a wink, Watanabe escorts Nico into a back area off the floor. Carpeted office dividers set off a small area, packed with super sophisticated computer equipment. 
Watanabe "boots up" a terminal, sits down with relish. WATANABE The last six years I've been risking nothing but money. It's a kick to risk my ass again. 
Nico eyes the equipment and Watanabe, impressed. 
NICO The old Spook. CUT AWAY TO: 263   OMITTED 265   INT. JACKSON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Jackson has the Senator's aide's papers spread before her, cataloging them with interest. The PHONE RINGS. Jackson picks it up. JACKSON (into phone) Jackson. Whoever the voice is (which we can't hear), it makes Jackson forget the documents. JACKSON (into phone) -- Yes... yes, of course, sister, I know who you are. (listens) -- where... where are you? 
CUT BACK TO: 266   INT. WATANABE'S COMPUTER AREA - NIGHT 
Watanabe working two computers simultaneously, with the gusto of a rock keyboard player. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                          75.         * 
WATANABE -- No way to access Covert Ops directly. But Ornstein's at Princeton, he's got a database bigger than Langley -- (works keyboard lovingly) If I can't crack that turkey's code, it's time to hang up my rock and roll shoes -- Nico watches Watanabe work. 
WATANABE -- ah, here! Here's a little trap door. Let's see if we can wriggle up into -- (watches the screen with anticipation) Personnel files! Operative dossiers. Will that do? NICO It's a start. Nico sits down beside Watanabe. DISSOLVE TO: 267   FULL ASHTRAY Watanabe stubs out a cigarette. Empty coffee cups all around. Nico paces, reading a hard-copy printout. NICO Fox has had a helluva career. (reads down page) '69 to '76, Cambodia, Laos. Operation Phoenix. Operation Green Mountain. Operaton Northstar. This is all Vang Pao, it's all heroin -- WATANABE You friend has found his metier. 
Nico circles the "operations" on the page, hands it to Watanabe. 
NICO Run personnel retrievals on all these operations. I want the names of every company man who was on them. 
QUICK DISSOLVE TO: 
268   CLOSE - COMPUTER SCREEN A list of about thirty names -- mostly civilian, but some with military rank attached.

NICO (O.S.) Altshuler. Cosgrove. I know half these guys -- (thinking) Okay... now run me an update. Where are these fuckers now? QUICK DISSOLVE TO: 
The Woman walks slowly down the hall. She carries a small donation can. She knocks on a door. We hear FOOTSTEPS from within the apartment. The door opens. It's Bonifacia, the nun from the church (though now in civvies). The Middle-Aged Woman with the donation can raises it as if asking for a contribution. Bonificia looks flustered, impatient. She really doesn't want to leave the door open. 
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN Exusame, por favor. Tiene dinero para... 
280   FROM NOWHERE 
Three of Salvano's armed goons appear on both sides of the doorway. They push both women violently into the apartment. 
281   CLOSEUP - GOON He steps quickly, surely into the apartment. 
282   CLOSEUP - BEDROOM DOOR It flies open.   The goon points his gun AT the CAMERA. 
283   GUNMEN'S POV 
Father Tomassino, the Costa Rican priest, stands at the window, he has been trying to open it. He turns. He knows he can't escape. 
284   EXT. APARTMENT - POV FROM SALVANO'S CAR The light in the apartment window blinks twice. 
285   EXT. TENEMENT - STREET - NIGHT From two cars emerge the shapes of several men. 286   EXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHT Jackson's car -- with Jackson, Nico and Lukich aboard -- swings around a corner into a traffic jam. The HORN BLARES. 287   INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - THIRD FLOOR - NIGHT A STEREO SPEAKER BLASTS MUSIC from the front room. CAMERA PANS ACROSS Bonifacia's bedroom dresser. We see mementos of her life and a photo of herself with Father Genarro with a group of children. CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN PAST Bonifacia's bed, PAST Bonifacia's body! CAMERA CONTINUES DOWN TO the floor, where lies the lady who planted the bomb. They both appear dead. 288   CLOSE - FATHER TOMASSINO 
He is in a chair, his wrists strapped to the chair arms.    He is sweating, fearful but clinging to his courage. 289   ANOTHER ANGLE 
Behind Father Tomassino, we see Salvano, Chi Chi and two other goons, armed with pistols. Salvano moves toward the priest, sets a small TV table down beside him. The priest glances toward it -- 
290   PRIEST'S POV - TV TABLE Atop its rickety surface:   a fearsome array of syringes and drug vials. 
291   BACK TO FATHER TOMASSINO He glances up from the hypodermics -- 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                           80. 
292   PRIEST'S POV INTO FRAME moves Kurt Zagon! We see clearly the 15 years of   * aging since SE Asia. His face is even scarier than when he performed similar atrocities in those days. Zagon prepares a syringe, tests it, shooting a clear liquid skyward. ZAGON You'll be in heaven in a few minutes, padre. But first I'm going to put you through hell. 293   EXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHT 
Nico, Lukich and Jackson are speeding through the infamous Southside. We want to scream at them to get there already. 
294   BACK TO APARTMENT 
Salvano holds the priest's arm steady, Zagon moves in with the needle. ZAGON You came here to talk to the                        * Senator's aide, didn't you?                         * 
FATHER TOMASSINO I tried.   But you killed him first.                * ZAGON Who told you about our plans?                       * FATHER TOMASSINO This is from confession. I tell no one. 
ZAGON You wouldn't lie to me, Father?   It's a sin. 
Father Tomassino says nothing, he begins to cry. ZAGON (almost with kindness) If you spoke to anyone, tell me now -- (indicates hypo) -- and I won't have to use this. 
295   EXT. TENEMENT - NIGHT The unmarked police car pulls up, across the street. 
296   INT. CAR - NIGHT 
Nico, Jackson, and Lukich gaze at the building. 
leaps off the roof! 
312   ANGLE - ELEVATED TRAIN - MOVING Nico lands on the roof of the speeding "el" train, his momentum nearly carrying him off the far side -- 
313   NICO - ATOP TRAIN catches a railing, claws at it.   BULLETS rip into the train roof all around him -- 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                          84. 
314    ATOP TENEMENT ROOF - SALVANO AND ZAGON FIRE for all they're worth at Nico's receding form. 
315    ATOP TRAIN - NICO crawls to the space between cars, lowers himself down.      He clings to the swaying chains. 
315A   INT. TRAIN CAR Nico staggers through the almost empty car and collapses on a bench. 
316    AROUND CORNER - TWO POLICE CARS hurtle INTO VIEW under the El, SIRENS BLARING.                   * 
317    BACK ON TENEMENT ROOF Zagon and Salvano scramble away. 318    OMITTED CUT TO: 
319    EXT. EL STATION - STAIRWAY TO STREET - NIGHT A cleaner, more upscale neighborhood. Nico labors down the steps, clutching his jacket to his ribs. Several affluent people look at him oddly, he ignores them, keeps going -- He makes his way up the street, weakening, to a tasteful brown- stone. Nico climbs the steps in pain -- QUICK DISSOLVE TO: 
320    INT. JACKSON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT Nico over the sink, shirt off, WATER RUNNING -- applying a makeshift bandage to his bloody ribs. We see Jackson's make- up stuff along the counter, feminine robes hanging on the door, law books around a reading stand. Nico is in real pain, exhausted, weakening -- 
321    LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Nico at Jackson's desk, its surface spread with the notes and papers she got from Senator Harrison's aide's place. We glimpse them: photos of Central American atrocities, dead bodies, etc. He tries to study them, quickly, but his attention shifts -- 
Nico glances around the apartment: more law books, Jackson's degree on the wall, her rowing machine on the floor, several framed photos beside him on her desk. Nico turns several toward him. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                          85. 
322    INSERT - FRAMED PHOTOS Jackson with her sisters and their kids, Jackson in law class, Jackson and Nico posing, smiling, at the police shoot- ing range -- 323    BACK TO NICO 
He starts to cry. 
NICO (to Jackson's photo) -- Had to be a hero... another fucking hero. I'm sorry Jax. He reaches for a small calendar, looks at it. 
324    CLOSEUP - CALENDAR 
Nico circles "meet with Father Tomassino." Nico circles another date, "Senator delivers foreign policy position paper/Committee for Democratic Policy fund raiser."             * 325    OMITTED 327    BACK TO NICO Nico scoops up the aide's papers, stands, wobbly -- 
NICO -- Senator... -- (of papers, with scorn) -- dumb fuck... think they're gonna let you put 'em outta business -- 327A   INT. EMERGENCY ROOM CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Several cops frantically clear the way to the emergency room. A gurney is wheeled down the corridor. Lukich, a shoulder bandaged, walks beside the gurney, holding the hand of Jackson. 
327B   CLOSEUP ON a bloody flak jacket rests upon the gurney. 
327C   CLOSEUP - JACKSON 
She's been sedated. She has buckshot wounds on her neck and shoulder, but she is alive. 
JACKSON (to Lukich) You call Nico's goddamn Uncle and find out if he's heard anything. 
SARA -- You've got to do it, Nico.    You know you have to. Whatever Sara is proposing, Nico is dead set against it. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                         88.      * 
ROSA Listen to her, Nicola. (dead serious) Whatever you think of him, Federico is family. He is our family. Nico makes no response.   Instead, he lifts Julian, nuzzles him tenderly. 
NICO Ever notice how clean babies smell? Like nothing in the world has touched them yet. 
Sara glances to Rosa. Rosa knows what she wants. Dis- creetly Rosa rises, exits. Sara and Nico are alone. 
SARA If you won't go to him, I will. NICO (in pain) Don't push me like this -- Her eyes meet his -- loving, but desperate. 
SARA Branca can put us on a plane -- but where can we fly to? Tibet? The moon? There's nowhere they can't find us. 
NICO You don't know what the hell you're talking about. SARA I'm talking about everything I've learned from you in the past five years. 
Nico is in agony. NICO You know I can't go to him. Sara takes both his hands in hers. 
SARA Do you know why I love you? Do you know what it is about you that I've always loved? (as Nico fights his own emotion) Pride. It's what you have inside. You don't live the way other people live. You trust what you see as right and won't let anyone or anything make you stray from it. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                           88A.      * 
MOVE IN PAST Sara TO Nico's face. SARA (O.S.) But now that pride may kill all of us. (beat) You've got to swallow that pride, Nico. Choke on it if you have to. Lay it aside. 
339   ANOTHER ANGLE - NICO AND SARA Close together, with their baby between them. Sara buries her face against her husband's chest. Nico's arm goes around her. He holds her tight. CUT TO: 
340   CLOSE - NICO - AGAINST WALL - DAY He wears a suit and tie, a hat.   All business. MAN (O.S.) Is this the attorney? ANOTHER MAN (O.S.) You can come now, Mr. Carlucci. O.S. we hear a METALLIC sound BEGIN, VERY CLOSE -- PULL BACK TO: 
341   ANOTHER ANGLE To reveal bars which slide electrically to the side.    A prison door opens, letting him through. 
342   ANGLE - PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY Nico, escorted by a prison guard, walks down a long, blank hallway. CUT TO: 
343   NICO Waiting in a barren reception room.   Several benches, tables; heavy steel mesh over windows -- 
344   NICO'S POV - ACROSS ROOM A steel door opens on the far side. Out steps a small Italian man in his seventies, wearing the faded denim of an inmate. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                         88B-90. 
345   INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - LONG SHOT - DAY                          * Nico and the small man (FREDERICO LARUSSO) walk together down * a long corridor, speaking occasionally, the tension thick     * between them. Behind them, a discreet fifteen paces, walk     * two armed prison officials. 346   CLOSER - LARUSSO AND NICO 
The old man never looks directly at Nico, yet we sense keenly that he is taking the younger man's measure. FREDERICO LARUSSO I am only an old man. An old man with a cancer. The two are like an old and a young lion, appraising each other -- using all five senses and more. 
NICO I don't have much time, Uncle.    So I must speak plainly. Larusso listens.   Nico waits for a beat.   Then: 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                          91. 
NICO (this is very painful for him) -- For as long as I've been old enough to think, I've hated you and hated everything you stood for. Larusso takes this in without a flicker. 
NICO I was so sure that you and I were on opposite sides of the fence... and that you and your people were destroying this country -- Nico pauses, glances away across the grounds. 
Fox looks shaky, unnerved: Nico's words have hit too close to home. Now Nico backs away a step, ready for anything. One of Zagon's agents holds their car's rear door open.        * 
NICO Thanks for the help, Fox. 
FOX I didn't bring him, Nico.    I swear it! ZAGON Have you two been sharing fond memories? Reminiscing about the good old days? 
Zagon waves Nico and Fox toward his car. Zagon and             * Salvano start forward. Fox glances, torn, to Nico, who has backed away another half-step. Will Nico attack? Run for it? 
100A. 
FOX Stay still! (to Nico) Don't fucking move!! 
Fox pulls his .45 from concealment, covering Nico. An EVENING-GOWNED WOMAN, waiting with her husband for their car, hears Fox's shout, sees his gun. 
EVENING GOWN WOMAN (grabs her husband's arm) Jack -- 
The husband sees. So do the other guests. Salvano sees their alarm; he swings his jacket open, revealing a snub machine gun. Someone SCREAMS -- 
ZAGON Bring in our friend, Nelson. Salvano's muzzle covers Fox and Nico -- 
ZAGON Be a good boy -- 372   FOX 
His moment of truth. FOX Dive, Nico!! He FIRES -- at Salvano! In the same instant, Salvano pulls his own trigger! Salvano's MACHINE GUN BURST cuts Fox down, a milli-second before Fox's .45 SLUG BLOWS Salvano off his feet! Pandemonium. Fox, dying, slings his .45 to Nico, who snatches it from the ground just as a HAIL of MACHINE GUN FIRE THUNDERS around him. Nico dives headlong behind a concrete column, which is instantly chewed to shreds by GUNFIRE. Zagon FIRES his MAC-10 on full automatic. A second agent hurries forward to outflank Nico. Nico pops from behind the column, DRILLS the agent broadside behind the ear, blowing the whole side of his head off! Guests and valets are shrieking in terror, hitting the deck in clusters, clawing and scrambling over each other for safety. ZAGON (to first agent, advancing) Move! Nico springs from cover, FIRING, trying to bolt down the garage ramp, toward the lower levels. His path puts the first agent directly in Zagon's line of fire. Zagon doesn't hesitate; he OPENS UP on Nico, cutting down his own man -- Salvano has gotten to his feet, wounded, but still handling his gun. He  joins Zagon, rushing forward -- 
373   RAMP TO LOWER LEVELS A valet rounds a corner, unsuspecting, bringing up a car. Nico is on him like a cat, tearing the poor boy from behind the wheel, leaping in -- 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                          102. 
374    ZAGON AND SALVANO tear around the corner at the top of the ramp.    Both OPEN FIRE as -- 
375    NICO - IN CAR highballs straight toward them! 
376    SALVANO hold the trigger down, FULL AUTOMATIC -- 
377    NICO'S CAR (MOVING) Nico drops below the dash, driving blind. The WINDSHIELD is BLOWN APART, both FRONT TIRES EXPLODE, the RADIATOR BLASTS STEAM -- 
378    ZAGON Reloading as Salvano FIRES. 379    NICO'S CAR pinwheels out of control, its nose facing away from Salvano and Zagon. The car BRAKES FURIOUSLY -- 380    NICO hits reverse, looking back over the seat -- 381    NICO'S POV - THROUGH REAR CAR WINDOW He sees Salvano, his clip empty now, hurrying to wrestle a fresh magazine in -- 382    ANGLE - NICO'S CAR AND SALVANO 
Nico floors it in reverse, slamming into Salvano, lifting him off his feet, smashing him with the car into a metal      * grate wall.                                                   * 
383    SALVANO A horrible death.

From the eighth floor the metal grate of the parking struc-   * ture blows out onto the street below, followed by Salvano's   * body.                                                         *

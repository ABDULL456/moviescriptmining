1 OVER BLACK 1 Muffled music; soothing, generic. 
AUTOMATED VOICE Thank you for your patience. Your call is important to us. We will be with you shortly. 
2 INT. MANSION FLAT, LONDON - DAY 2 
A neat, well-appointed flat, tastefully decorated. Framed against a large window which looks out over the city, an elegant woman in her 70's: EVELYN GREENSLADE. She's on the phone, on hold. On the desk in front of her is a brand new laptop computer; the screen reads 'Getting Started ...' 
AUTOMATED VOICE 
(ON PHONE) Thank you for your patience. Your call is important to us. We will be with you shortly. Evelyn's patience is strained nonetheless. She taps her fingers on the desk. AUTOMATED VOICE (cont'd) 
(ON PHONE) Thank you for your patience. Your call is - A slightly-accented voice finally interrupts. 
FEMALE VOICE Mrs Greenslade, thank you for 
WAITING - 
EVELYN 
(OVERLAPPING) Yes, now if you could stay on the phone for a moment and talk to me, just talk to me. I'm not even clear, I don't actually understand what it is I'm trying to order. Is wireless the same as wi-fi? And what do either of them have to do with broadband? 
FEMALE VOICE Mrs Greenslade, since the account is not in your name, before we can make any changes we need to speak to the account holder. Can I please talk to the account holder? 
EVELYN What? 
FEMALE VOICE I'm asking if I can speak to the account holder. Before we can make any changes - 
EVELYN You can't talk to him, no. 
(BEAT) He's dead. He died. There's only me. 
3 INT. CORRIDOR/JUDGES CHAMBERS. INNS OF COURT - NIGHT 3 
GILES, a judge in full wig and robes, moves quickly down a corridor. He passes other judges, going the opposite way. He arrives at the office of GRAHAM DASHWOOD, goes in. GRAHAM is at his desk. His robes are on a hanger, his wig is on a stand beside him. 
GILES We're late. 
4 INT. CORRIDOR. INNS OF COURT - NIGHT 4 
Moments later. Graham and Giles walk down the corridor. 
GRAHAM Bloody retirement parties. Hard cheese, soft wine, and endless speeches. Why do people do that? No one ever said about any kind of party: it was a wonderful occasion, just a shame that the speeches were so short. 
GILES it'll be you one day. 
GRAHAM One day very soon. 
GILES You've been saying that for years. They walk into a large room, full of lawyers. 
4A INT. HALL. INNS OF COURT - CONTINUOUS 4A 
At one end of the hall, a very old JUDGE is giving a very dull speech. 
JUDGE An occasion such as this leads one to cast ones mind back to the days when I first entered my pupillage. I had the very good fortune of serving as a junior to Mr Justice Stancombe Graham's not listening any more. He's looking around the room. At the old, tired faces. 
JUDGE (CONT'D) . the unwelcome news that I would transfer Chambers, bringing to mind the old adage a fronte praecipitium, a tergo 1upi Everything seems to slow down, the judge's mouth moving more and more sluggishly, though his voice remains the same. The effect is strange .. then the sound of laughter. 
GRAHAM This is the day. Everyone looks round at him. He's almost as surprised as they are that he's spoken out loud. 
GILES Graham? 
GRAHAM This is the day. He turns and walks out. 
5 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 5 
Staff bustle around a busy A & E ward. MURIEL lies on a bed in the corridor. The Head Nurse, KAREN, rushes past. 
MURIEL Listen, young lady. I want a cup of tea, and I want it now. 
KAREN The trolley will be along shortly. 
MURIEL How hard d'you have to fall down before you get some proper attention? Hours I've been lying here, and not a single doctor has come to see me. 
The mellifluous tones continue. Madge mouths the words to herself as she scans the same web-page. 
INDIAN VOICE it exudes historical ambience and is graced with breathtaking surroundings .' 
14 INT. SALON - DAY 14 
Jean whom we earlier saw looking at the bungalow, is at the hairdressers. Her stylist ABI listens to her reading a computer printout for the same hotel. Which looks classy, elegant, and welcoming. Madge's voice bleeds into Jean's. 
JEAN 
(READING) 'Lofty terraces, open courtyards, domes, arches and canopied balconies transport one back in time.' 
ABI I wouldn't mind going there myself. 
15 EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY 15 
In the background, a train rumbles along the Piccadilly Line towards Heathrow. Douglas, Jean's husband, is on the green with his friend SIMON. Douglas is lining up a tricky putt. 
SIMON There won't be any golf courses. 
DOUGLAS Just as well. I can't afford the green fees. 
SIMON But a retirement home? Douglas misses his putt. 
DOUGLAS It's a luxury development, where all the residents are in their golden years. 
SIMON Like the Costa Brava. 
DOUGLAS Yes. But with more elephants. Simon holes out. 
16 INT. JUDGES CHAMBERS - DAY 16 
Graham, the judge, is in his office. It's nearly empty; his entire life is being packed away. His friend Giles watches him put more things in boxes. 
GILES How long have we known each other? And you've never once talked about India. 
GRAHAM D'you want these books? 
GILES You might need them again. Graham smiles at him, calls out. 
GRAHAM Mrs Megson! His cleaner, MRS MEGSON, comes in. 
MRS MEGSON Sir? Graham takes a beautiful vase off the shelf, gives it to her. 
GRAHAM I want you to have this. 
MRS MEGSON Are you sure? 
GRAHAM Absolutely. There's a slight crack on the bottom. But I think you might know something about that already. Mrs Megson goes. 
GRAHAM (CONT'D) I used to live there. A long time ago. 
17 INT. BASEMENT BEDSIT. EARLS COURT - DAY 17 
A bedsit. Slightly down at heel, and sparsely furnished. Norman, whom we met speed dating, is talking to someone. We don't see who. Quietly, in the background, Radio 2 music from an old battery radio. 
NORMAN I have to go. I do. And I could say I wish you'd come, but I've never lied to you. We both know I need more than you can offer. We know that. Don't we? We see who's sitting in front of him. An ancient dachshund. 
NORMAN (CONT'D) (to the dog) Don't make that face at me. Norman's Polish landlady, MRS JELLINEK, is at the door. 
MRS JELLINEK (to her dog) You. Upstairs. The dog hops off the chair, and leaves. Norman watches him go. MRS JELLINEK (cont'd) Any warm clothes you have use for no more, I take them. And not forget to leave keys when you go. She leaves. Norman is left alone. 
NORMAN I'll miss you too. 
18 EXT. HOUSING ESTATE - DAY 18 
The district ambulance driver, JACKSON, is pushing Muriel in a wheelchair across a housing estate. 
MURIEL You know who'll be there, don't you? Indians. Loads of them, A sea of brown faces and black hearts, all greasy haired and reeking of spices. Never see one on their own, do you? No, becuase they hunt in packs. All the better to rob me blind and - 
JACKSON You know what? You can take it from here. 
MURIEL You're supposed to see me into my flat. That's what they said. 
JACKSON My wife is from Mumbai. He heads off. Muriel shouts after him. 
MURIEL No good moaning to me, mate. You married her! But he's gone. Muriel wheels herself on over the bumpy ground. 
19 EXT. PASSENGER DROP-OFF. STANSTED AIRPORT - EVENING 19 
A reluctant Christopher is pushing a trolley carrying Evelyn's cases to the terminal. 
AIRPORT ANNOUNCER Ladies and gentlemen, we regret to inform you that owing to bad weather, Flight 105 to Jaipur has been cancelled. The airline is happy to arrange 
CUT TO: 
25 INT. AIRPORT. DELHI - DAY 25 
Hours later. The airport is deserted, except for the Marigold Hotel party, who sit slumped and exhausted on another row of seats, with Muriel's wheelchair at the other end. After a moment, Graham says 
GRAHAM Alright. Plan B. 
26 INT. DELHI AIRPORT - DAY 26 
Moments later. They're all moving briskly through the hi- tech, ultra-modern, beautifully air-conditioned building. 
JEAN Of course it's a good idea. Who can you trust if not a High Court Judge? 
DOUGLAS And this way we see more of the country. Norman is pushing Muriel's wheelchair. 
NORMAN (leaning down, to 
MURIEL) If anyone asks, say you're my mother. I don't want people to think we're together. 
MURIEL In your dirty dreams. 
JEAN Douglas, these are not words that often pass my lips, but you may actually be right. The country seems to be rather more civilised than one originally thought. 
27 EXT. DELHI BUS STATION - EVENING 27 
Moments later. Our heroes are in the middle of an extraordinary scene. Stifling heat, deafening noise; the chaos, the bustle, the grime, the crowds, the life. They're surrounded by taxi drivers, baggage handlers,beggars etc. All clamouring for their attention. Evelyn looks a little shocked. Jean is traumatized, a handkerchief to her face. 
Graham, at the ticket booth, triumphantly holds up a fistful of tickets. 
GRAHAM (shouting over the din) The bus will drop us in the centre of town. We can take tuk- tuks the rest of the way! They follow him through the hordes. And see their bus. It's absolutely rammed. People are practically hanging out of the windows. 
MADGE There's not enough room. 
GRAHAM It's time to prove the first and only rule of India: there's always room. He starts to fight his way to the door. Evelyn's at the back. She stops, for a moment, looks around her. 
EVELYN What larks, Pip. Douglas is just ahead of her. He turns, smiles. 
DOUGLAS Let's hope so. 
28 EXT. HIGHWAY - EVENING 28 
Muriel's wheelchair is strapped to the back of the bus, which is screaming down the six-lane highway. A huge tower of luggage is piled precariously on the roof. The road appears to be complete chaos; cars, buses, even cows overtaking each other. The bus pulls into the outside lane to follow a truck which is overtaking some slower vehicles. As the truck pulls back into the inside lane, it reveals a huge truck barrelling towards them on the wrong carriageway. Norman, sitting at the front, screams his last scream... 
NORMAN 
NOOOOOOO... . U At the last minute, the bus pulls back into the inside lane. The Indians on the bus take absolutely no notice. 
29 INT. BUS - EVENING 29 
Norman is grinning from ear to ear. 
NORMAN I'm loving this! Evelyn is sitting next to Madge. 
EVELYN A few months ago I was organising the church flowers. 
MADGE Are you struggling with the feeling you're not in control of your circumstances? 
EVELYN A little. 
MADGE You know what the shortest prayer in the world is? 
EVELYN No. 
MADGE Fuck it. Evelyn laughs. 
MADGE (CONT'D) You're not doing the church flowers any more. May as well enjoy the ride. Douglas is watching a nice Indian family. They're having a picnic. The father notices Douglas looking, offers him some food. Douglas makes the namaste gesture, takes some happily. 
JEAN Are you insane? "Avoid all food not from a reputable vendor, it will have been washed with impure water." Douglas keeps eating, with great enjoyment. 
DOUGLAS It's just a sandwich. 
JEAN Marvellous. Then I'll have the ham, cheese, and streptococcus, please. Or perhaps the bacteria, lettuce and tomato. Douglas turns to Muriel. 
DOUGLAS Would you like some of this? I believe it's aloo ka paratha. 
MURIEL If I can't pronounce it, I'm not eating it. The cacophony of horns continues. Jean screams, as another collision looms. 
30 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK 30 
MURIEL Hell. I'm in hell. 
47 EXT. STREET. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 47 
The sun rises. A washer-man bicycles up to the hotel, a load of clean sheets balanced on his handlebars. Shopkeepers on the street are beginning to set out their wares. 
EVELYN (V.0.) Day Nine. Old habits die easier than we think, and new ones form. 
48 INT. EVELYN'S ROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 48 
Evelyn is typing - hunt and peck - at her computer. Beside her, the classified pages of the local newspaper. 
EVELYN (V.0.) No longer do I reach out in the morning for Radio 4. My news comes instead from the Jaipur 
HERALD 
49 EXT. STREET, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 49 
A sign reads: 'THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL FOR THE 
ELDERLY AND BEAUTIFUL - OPEN FOR BUSINESS.' Sonny affixes a sticker: 'NOW WITH GUESTS!' 
EVELYN (V.0.) . Soon I might even grow accustomed to the storm of car horns and vendors. 
50 EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 50 
The main road in Jaipur is chaotically busy. Crowds, bikes, cows, dust, noise, and laughter. Sonny's battered old car has broken down. Madge is in the front seat, Douglas and Jean in the back. Sonny is aiming a couple of kicks at the engine. 
EVELYN (V.0.) Can there be anywhere else in the world that is such an assault on the senses? 
51 EXT/INT. PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICE, JAIPUR - DAY 51 
An office out of a Kafka novel; cloth bags containing files are piled all around the room, floor to ceiling. Graham is seated at a desk, in front of a sober official. He is filling in a form. 
EVELYN (V.0.) Those who know the country of old just go about their business. But nothing can prepare the uninitiated for this riot of noise and colour ... 
51A EXT. JANTAR MANTAR OBSERVATORY. JAIPUR - DAY 51A 
Norman seems less interested in the astonishing geometric devices of the ancient observatory than in the female tourists who have come to see them... 
52 EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 52 
The chaos and din of the street is even more mind-boggling. Madge now has the bonnet up, and is studying the engine. Douglas stands in the street, staring in wonderment around him. Inside the car, Jean looks utterly traumatized, shrinking lower in her seat as a horde of kids swarm at the windows, shouting, wheedling, gesticulating. Sonny does his best to wave them away. 
EVELYN (V.0.) ... for the heat, the motion, the perpetual teeming crowds. Sonny is conducting his own personal assault on our senses 
53 INT. UPPER COURTYARD, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 53 
The guests look on with trepidation, as another meal is laid before them. 
EVELYN (V.0.) with the flow of exotic dishes he demands daily from the kitchen. Mooli Moong Dal. Baghara Baingan. Banjari Gosht. Paneer Methi Chaman ... As the list unfolds, the guests, one by one, enter their bathrooms; a litany of doors closing Until Norman. EVELYN (V.0.) (cont'd) Mutton Vindaloo ... Norman lies on his bed, reading the Kama Sutra. He spins the book round, in order to study an illustration more intently. 
54 INT. HOSPITAL, JAIPUR - DAY 54 
The hospital puts the NHS to shame. It's hi-tech, bright, and spanking clean. 
Sonny pushes Muriel through the doors of the lobby. The reception area is a forest of dark skin. Muriel is rigid with fear. 
EVELYN (V.0.) Initially you're overwhelmed. But gradually you realise: it's like a wave. Resist, and you'll be knocked over ... Sonny is in discussion with some doctors. Then he turns to see that Muriel has vanished. Through the window Muriel can be seen frantically wheeling herself away down the path... EVELYN (V.0.) (cont'd) Dive into it, and you'll swim out the other side. 
55 EXT/INT. STREET/ROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 55 
Madge is exchanging some coins with a street trader in return for a mobile phone. In her room, Madge scans a phone directory, and dials a number. 
EVELYN (V.0.) This is a new and different world. 
56 INT. EVELYN'S ROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 56 
Evelyn is finishing her blog. She picks up the paper, checks something. 
EVELYN (V.0.) The challenge is to cope with it. 
57 EXT. GARDEN, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 57 
Evelyn is coming down the path to the gate. 
EVELYN (V.0.) And not just cope ... but thrive. 
58 EXT. STREET, JAIPUR - DAY 58 
Evelyn is walking down a rough street on the outskirts of the city. Kids are everywhere, laughing, shouting, doing tricks, begging. Evelyn approaches them, holding up a piece of paper. 
SONNY Hello Jay. 
JAY Sonny boy. 
SONNY Don't call me that. Jay smiles, holds the door open for Sunaina. 
JAY Let's go. 
70 EXT. GARDEN - EVENING 70 
Jean is sitting in a chair, reading. Graham comes up the path. 
JEAN Good evening, Your Honour. 
GRAHAM Mrs Ainslie. I hope you had a good day. What did you get up to? 
JEAN Well, I started in my bedroom, where I had a lovely couple of hours giving all the cockroaches names. Then after a lunch that will long have a place in my heartburn, I came out here and stared blindly at a book waiting for someone - anyone to rescue me. And how glad I am it was you. 
GRAHAM Why would you not go out? There's so much to see. Jean had hoped for some appreciation of her wit, and is floored by his question. She can hardly understand, let alone tell him, the depths of her discomfort. 
GRAHAM (CONT'D) Open your eyes, Mrs Ainslie. All life is here, I tell you. Jean stares at him. He goes on through the archway into the hotel. Then stops. 
GRAHAM (CONT'D) I could talk to the chef, if you like. Perhaps get you some grilled chicken, plain rice. 
JEAN I would appreciate that very much. Graham goes on in. Jean just sits there. Wishing he'd come back out again. 
71 EXT. TERRACE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 71 
Muriel is back. She's in her chair, on the terrace outside her room. A young hotel worker, ANOKHI, brings out a tray of food to her. Muriel watches her, but Anokhi is deferential, won't meet Muriel's eyes. She puts the tray down and leaves. Muriel just sits there, glaring balefully into the night, the untouched tray of food by her side. 
72 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD - NIGHT 72 
Evelyn comes into the dining area. Graham is there, at a table in the corner. 
GRAHAM Good evening. 
EVELYN Good evening. Evelyn sits at her table. 
EVELYN (CONT'D) I trust you had a good day? 
GRAHAM I'd rather hear about yours. 
EVELYN I got a job. My first. Ever. I'm going to be a sort of cultural advisor. 
GRAHAM A role I'm sure you'll perform with great distinction. He's about to inquire further, when Evelyn sees Douglas and Jean emerge from their room. 
EVELYN Perhaps if you wouldn't mind keeping that news to yourself. 
GRAHAM I'm flattered you shared it with me. He turns to greet the new arrivals. 
GRAHAM (CONT'D) Good evening, the Ainslies. 
EVELYN Have you had a good day? 
DOUGLAS Spectacular. 
(TO GRAHAM) I went to the temple you told me about. A place of meditation and peace, quite stunning. 
JEAN So spiritual, I bet you hardly noticed the smell of elephant dung. 
DOUGLAS No elephants, sadly. Still none. 
(TO GRAHAM) I thought I might see you there. Where did you get to instead? 
JEAN Yes, where do you get to every day? 
GRAHAM Well, I've just finished telling Mrs Greenslade all about it. Evelyn registers the lie, but says nothing. 
JEAN I'm sure she wouldn't mind hearing it again. She waits. But Graham is as elusive as he is tactful. 
GRAHAM I talked to the chef for you. He said it will be no problem. 
JEAN Did you hear that, Douglas? Plain grilled food; manna from heaven. 
DOUGLAS I don't have to have it too, do 
I? 
JEAN 
(TO GRAHAM) I don't know how to thank you. 
SONNY A great amount. Plenty of rooms, no question. They've arrived in the courtyard. 
SONNY (CONT'D) I am not a details man, Mr Maruthi. 
MR MARUTHI Nor was your father. They see Muriel on her verandah. 
SONNY Mr Maruthi, I present to you one of our beloved guests. Dear Mrs Donnelly, please describe in as much detail as you desire your experience of the ambience and atmosphere of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. 
MURIEL Kill me. Kill me now. Sonny steers Mr Maruthi towards the reception, speaks quietly. 
SONNY The wheel is spinning. But the hamster is dead. He stops, as he sees an elegant older woman standing in the doorway. This is the redoubtable MRS KAPOOR. 
SONNY (CONT'D) Mummyji! What are you doing here? 
MRS KAPOOR You called. I came. 
SONNY I couldn't have called. The phones don't work. 
MRS KAPOOR That's why I came. 
78 INT. SONNY'S OFFICE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 78 
Moments later. Sonny closes the door behind him. His mother starts going through the contents of his desk. 
MRS KAPOOR Who was that man out there? 
SONNY The contents of this desk are mine. Don't open the drawers. I must insist you don't open the drawer. Mrs Kapoor opens the drawer. 
SONNY (CONT'D) Tell me why you have come. 
MRS KAPOOR Do I need a reason to visit my favourite son? 
SONNY No. He is in his mansion in Delhi. 
MRS KAPOOR My second favourite. 
SONNY He went to Kerala to make his fortune. 
MRS KAPOOR But make it, he did. 
SONNY As I will make mine. I have a dream, Mummyji. A most brilliant one: to out-source old age. And not just for the British. There are many other countries where they don't like old people too. 
MRS KAPOOR Your brothers own a third of the hotel each, they are entitled to a third of the profits. 
SONNY Success does not happen overnight, Mummyji. This is blue sky thinking, and it requires long-term strategy and patience. 
MRS KAPOOR How is your girlfriend? 
SONNY I look forward to you meeting her. 
MRS KAPOOR And I look forward to you meeting the woman you will marry. She is from a good family in Delhi. 
SONNY I can marry as I choose, Mummyji. I need no permission. 
MRS KAPOOR I presume it is your girlfriend who teaches you such nonsense. One reason not to marry her. 
SONNY What if I love her? 
MRS KAPOOR An even better reason. Now send Young Wasim to the car for my luggage. 
SONNY He cannot carry, he has a dicky back ... wait, your luggage? How long are you staying? 
MRS KAPOOR As long as it takes. 
79 INT. BATHROOM. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S. MARIGOLD HOTEL - 79 
DAY Jean is looking out of her bathroom window, down into the courtyard. She sees Graham come out of his room. She turns back to the mirror, looks at herself. 
80 EXT. MURIEL'S TERRACE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 80 
Near to Muriel, Anokhi is sweeping the floor. 
MURIEL You won't get the dirt out like that. Anokhi just smiles at her radiantly. 
MURIEL (CONT'D) I worked in service for years, looked after a lovely house. I kept it spotless. You need a bit more pressure on that brush. Graham walks past, on his way out. 
GRAHAM She won't speak English. She's what used to be called an Untouchable. An outcast, born below society. To a good Hindu, even her shadow is polluted. He greets Anokhi in Hindi, and heads for the door. 
MURIEL Where d'you go every day? Is it a woman? Nip round there for a curry and a bit of afters? 
GRAHAM I don't think so. I'm gay. Although nowadays more in theory than practice. Good day. He leaves. A moment later, Jean comes rushing out. Immediately she realises two things; first, that Graham has already gone. And second, that Muriel is watching her. 
EVELYN Which is beautiful. You people are young, vibrant, real. I'm sure the typical housewife would enjoy talking to each and every one of you. 
SUNAINA Her morning sounds like fun. What are you doing here? Beat. 
EVELYN I suppose I'm not typical anymore. 
(TO JAY) Is that the sort of thing? 
84 INT. MADGE'S ROOM - EVENING 84 
Madge is at her mirror, doing her make-up with great care. She looks beautiful. 
85 EXT. VICEROY CLUB BAR - EVENING 85 
Madge walks up the gravel path towards the magnificent building. She's superbly dressed, looks great. She goes up to the BARMAN. 
MADGE Excuse me. Would there be any wealthy single men in tonight? 
BARMAN There is one. Madge puts some money into his breast pocket. 
MADGE Perhaps you could seat me next to him? 
BARMAN This way, madam. He leads her along across the terrace. Madge follows, checking her hair, her breath, etc. The barman reaches an ornate suite of furniture. There's someone sitting there, his back to us, an elegant arm draped over the side of the chair. 
BARMAN (CONT'D) His Royal Highness Prince Michael of Kent. The man rises from his chair and turns. And Madge is left staring at Norman. There's a pause. Then Madge reaches into the barman's breast pocket, and removes her money. 
MADGE I'll have that back, thank you very much. 
86 EXT. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 86 
Graham comes through the courtyard, heads for his room. Muriel is on her verandah. 
GRAHAM Good evening. Muriel nods at him, and he goes on into his room. A moment later, Jean sits down next to Muriel. 
JEAN You know where he goes. I know you know. But you won't tell me. Muriel says nothing. 
JEAN (CONT'D) I can get Hobnobs out here, you know. I know a way. 
(BEAT) As many as you want. Milk or plain. Long pause. 
MURIEL Public Records Office. 
JEAN Thank you. 
87 EXT. WELL - EVENING 87 
A huge construction, centuries old, with a series of steps reaching down deep into the earth, so people can climb down to get their water. Young couples sit on the steps in the evening heat, boys leap into the water. Sonny and Sunaina are watching the swimmers. 
SONNY My father used to bring me to this well to swim. He said the water was better, and so were the people we would meet. 
(BEAT) He would have liked you so much. Sunaina smiles at this. 
SONNY (CONT'D) My mother doesn't want us to be married. 
SUNAINA She hasn't met me yet. 
SONNY She doesn't need to meet you Sunaina absorbs this. 
SONNY (CONT'D) She knows you are not from Delhi. That you have no family money, and work in a call centre. You are a part of a new India she cannot welcome. 
SUNAINA Isn't this where you tell her what you want? 
SONNY That conversation will be easier when the hotel is a success. 
SUNANINA Do you love me? 
SONNY I have found a new investor. I am most optimistic that he will enable us to move forward with Phase Two of the Marigold Hotel 
PROJECT 
SUNANINA Shouldn't you finish Phase One first? 
SONNY In business, if you stand still, you move backwards. No, I have that wrong. If you stand still, you are overtaken by people going the other way. Wait - 
SUNAINA You didn't answer the question. Do you love me? 
SONNY My feelings for you cannot be reduced to a single word. 
SUNAINA It's a nice word, Sonny. And people like hearing it. 
SONNY Sunaina, please. My mother is wrong. It is you who are too good for me. 
CAROL I'm afraid I don't. Madge gets up. 
MADGE I have to splash some water on my face. Please God I drown in it. She heads for the bathroom. Norman and Carol share another silence. 
CAROL Well look, it's been lovely chatting. 
NORMAN No it hasn't. 
CAROL No. It hasn't. But I really 
MUST - 
NORMAN Carol? She was about to go, stops. 
NORMAN (CONT'D) Can we drop all this pretence? And start again? I'm not charming. I'm not good at repartee. And I'm not a plutocrat with the sexual capacity of a rutting rhino. My name is Norman. And I'm lonely. 
CAROL My name is Carol. So am I. 
89 INT. VICEROY CLUB BAR - NIGHT 89 
Minutes later. Madge comes out of the bathroom. 
EVELYN (V.0.) Day 22. Like Darwin's finches, we are slowly adapting to our environment. And when one does adapt, my god, the riches that are available. Madge looks across the bar. And is startled to see Norman and Carol chatting up a storm, laughing together. As she watches, Norman orders more drinks, then turns smiling back to his new friend. Madge walks slowly out of the bar, and into the night. 
90 INT. EVELYN'S ROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 90 
Evelyn is at her computer, typing. 
EVELYN (V.0.) There is no past that we can bring back by longing for it 
91 EXT. PATH/GARDEN. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 91 
Ajit is pushing Muriel down to the gate for her morning constitutional. 
EVELYN . only a present that builds and creates itself as the past withdraws ... 
92 INT. SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE. CALL CENTRE - DAY 92 
Jay is counting out cash into Evelyn's hand; her first paycheck. 
EVELYN And India, like so many things in life, like life itself I suppose, is about what you bring to it. 
93 EXT. JAIPUR STREET - DAY 93 
Ajit is pushing Muriel through a poor neighborhood. Muriel is looking left and right, astounded by the life she sees. 
MURIEL Where's this? Where are we? 
AJIT Janta Colony Kachi Basti. 
MURIEL What happened to my usual route? 
AJIT Anokhi has invited you to her home. 
MURIEL You didn't tell me. 
AJIT You'd have said no. 
94 INT. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 94 
Jean is sitting, reading a book. 
JEAN Will you check in at the bank? Douglas emerges from the bathroom. 
DOUGLAS I checked yesterday. And the day before. As requested. 
(BEAT) Will you be staying in again? 
JEAN Why do you ask that every morning? 
DOUGLAS Because I hope for a different answer. Because I think you'll be hurt if I don't. And because it's not healthy for you to spend all day and every day in the confines of the hotel. He goes back into the bathroom. Jean changes the subject. 
JEAN I didn't sleep a wink. The tap in there never stops dripping. 
DOUGLAS (O.S.) I talked to Young Wasim about it. 
JEAN What did he say? 
DOUGLAS (O.S.) No idea. It was in Hindi. Douglas comes out of the bathroom, holding the tap. 
DOUGLAS (CONT'D) I thought I might get it fixed myself. 
EVELYN Yes. The thing is, you see, I did actually want to buy that. To brighten up my room. 
DOUGLAS He'll come after us. 
EVELYN Do you think so? 
DOUGLAS Absolutely. This is how the game is played. Just keep on walking. They push through the crowds. 
DOUGLAS (CONT'D) He's playing it cool, but he'll come. They keep walking. 
DOUGLAS (CONT'D) He's playing it very cool. They keep walking. Then Douglas stops. Evelyn looks at him. 
DOUGLAS (CONT'D) He's not coming. 
CUT TO: Moments later. They're back at Akram's stall. Evelyn counts out the money. 
EVELYN Eight hundred and fifty, nine hundred, nine hundred and fifty, one thousand. She turns to Douglas, smiles. 
EVELYN (CONT'D) You'll get him next time. Then she notices something. 
EVELYN (CONT'D) Why are you carrying a tap? 
97 INT. MARIGOLD HOTEL, DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM - DAY 97 
Jean gives up on the sentence she has already read a hundred times, and snaps her book shut. She stands, then sits again. Then stands. 
98 EXT. SWEEPER COLONY - DAY 98 
Ajit is now pushing Muriel through a poverty-stricken slum. The people live on the streets, or in collapsing tin shacks. Everywhere there is struggle and deprivation. And yet the pervasive atmosphere is nowhere near as depressing as we would expect. The colours are bright, the smiles on the children's faces even brighter. Not that Muriel can recognise the joy, of course. She's horrified by her surroundings. And acutely aware of the stares of the slum-dwellers. 
98A EXT. ANOKHI'S HUT - DAY 98A 
A primitive brick and cement hut, one of the few amongst dwellings made mostly from sticks and plastic bags. A bunch of young kids are fascinated by Muriel's wheelchair, pushing it around and taking turns to sit on it. 
99 INT. ANOKHI'S HUT - DAY 99 
Muriel sits on the only chair. Opposite - squashed together as if posing for a photograph - are all the generations of Anokhi's family: Anokhi herself, her husband, mother, grandmother, and several children. They all smile at Muriel. A long pause. Then Muriel turns to Ajit. 
MURIEL How soon can I leave? 
100 INT/EXT. HARDWARE SHOP - DAY 100 
Douglas is talking to JAMSHED, who works behind the counter. Evelyn sits outside. 
DOUGLAS You see what I think, and of course I'm no expert, is that the valve seat has eroded, so we'll need the washer changed and a new seat re-ground. Douglas glances back at Evelyn. Who betrays not the slightest scepticism. Jamshed studies the tap. 
JAMSHED The gland nut has come away from the spindle. 
DOUGLAS Well of course, it could be that too. Can you fix it? 
JAMSHED Not cheaply. Not cheaply. Most expensively indeed. Jamshed takes the tap to a workstation at the back, starts to fiddle with it. Douglas joins Evelyn. 
DOUGLAS I was in a tuk-tuk the other day, didn't seem to be taking the usual route back to the hotel. It turned out that the driver had decided to take me to another hotel, that he was sure I would prefer. And of course one wants to believe that he genuinely had my welfare at heart, and that it wasn't run bg his brother-in-law. 
(MORE) 
DOUGLAS (CONT'D) One wants to trust, in general, don't you think? But you never really know, do you? Jamshed stops fiddling with the tap. And takes a hammer to it. 
EVELYN The day I met my husband was the day the fair came to town. My girlfriend and I went on the carousel. Her horse was fine. But when the ride began I felt mine give a little, like it might collapse. Then these strong arms were around me, holding the horse together. And a voice in my ear said "Just trust me". And I did. Without question. Until the day he died. 
DOUGLAS How wonderful. 
EVELYN The sale of our flat went through last week. I had to sell it to pay off Hugh's debts. 
(BEAT) I've been forced to get a job out here. Which, in fact, I love. But even at Sonny's rates, I still couldn't make ends meet. After what my own husband did to our life savings. 
(BEAT) So no. You're right. You never know. Jamshed holds up the tap. Which is now in several parts. 
JAMSHED No good. You must be buying another. 
101 EXT. PATHWAY/GATE/STREET, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 101 
Jean walks down the path to the gate. She stops, looks fearfully at the chaotic sea of humanity outside. She's unable to move. Finally, she steps out. And is of course immediately assaulted by the assorted kids, beggars, street vendors, etc. As anxiety begins to engulf her, she quickens her pace, brushing through them as best she can, until she is almost running. 
102 INT. ANOKHI'S HUT - DAY 102 
Muriel is still at the tea party. Anokhi speaks. Ajit translates. 
AJIT She wants to thank you for your kindness. 
MURIEL I haven't been kind. 
GRAHAM I'm not embarrassed. Jean smiles wanly, grateful for his lie. 
JEAN Like I said. This country is driving me mad. 
(BEAT) Shall we go? 
107 EXT/INT. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY107 
Evelyn is outside in the courtyard. We don't see Douglas. 
EVELYN Anything? 
DOUGLAS (O.S.) Not yet. Evelyn waits a moment. 
EVELYN How about now? 
DOUGLAS (O.S.) One second. Another pause. DOUGLAS (O.S.) (cont'd) Oh good lord. 
EVELYN What? 
DOUGLAS (O.S.) Listen. The sound of a flowing tap. DOUGLAS (O.S.) (cont'd) And now ... The tap stops. DOUGLAS (O.S.) (cont'd) No drip. He appears in the doorway, triumphant. 
DOUGLAS (CONT'D) No drip! He walks towards her, hand in the air. 
DOUGLAS (CONT'D) Hi-five ! Evelyn just looks at him. She's never hi-fived anyone in her life. After a moment Douglas puts his hand down. 
DOUGLAS (CONT'D) I've never done that before. It just seemed appropriate. Jean has appeared at the other side of the courtyard. Douglas senses her mood, moves towards her. 
DOUGLAS (CONT'D) Darling! 
EVELYN Mrs Ainslie, how are you? Did you have a good day? Jean doesn't answer. She's staring at Douglas. Who looks so happy. 
DOUGLAS Let me tell you about ours. Your husband of many a year, who has never even known which end of a hammer to use, has actually managed to - 
JEAN 
(SUDDENLY INTERRUPTING) We have to get out of here. 
DOUGLAS What did you say? 
JEAN I can't stay in this country a moment longer. 
DOUGLAS Why ...? 
EVELYN Do excuse me. She makes a tactful exit. Jean is going past Douglas into their room. 
DOUGLAS I don't understand 
JEAN 
(INTERRUPTING) Pick a reason. Pick ten. The climate, the squalor, the poverty She goes past him into their room. 
108 INT. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 108 
JEAN . we should never have come. This whole trip is a grotesque fantasy. It's time to go home. Jean starts to pack. Irrationally, compulsively. 
DOUGLAS Who's paying for the tickets? 
JEAN (not hearing him) Look at us. A group of self- deluding old fossils traipsing around as if it's our bloody gap year. Humiliating ourselves 
DOUGLAS Not us, we can't pay. And I don't see you asking our friends 
BACK HOME 
JEAN 
(OVERLAPPING) .. We should just face up to the truth. That we're all old, we're all past it. That's the real truth, the raw, unvarnished fact of the matter. All we're good for now is the beige bloody bungalow with the sodding panic button in the sodding corner ... She stops packing, and subsides onto the bed, crying quietly. Nobody speaks for a while. 
DOUGLAS 
(GENTLY) We just have to make the best of it, darling. I really think that's the best thing to do. 
JEAN Yes, well. When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you. 
109 INT. MEEHAR CLINIC - MORNING 109 
An impossibly small roadside clinic. Norman is sitting there, the only man in three rows of brightly dressed women. DR RAMA comes out of the consulting area. 
DR RAMA Mr John Smith. No response. The doctor looks at Norman, who has forgotten his own alias. DR RAMA (cont'd) Mr John Smith? Norman jumps up. 
NORMAN That's right! Me! 
DR RAMA I've got some pills that'll help. 
112 EXT. SERVANTS COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 112 
The back of the hotel, where Sonny envisages his Phase Two development. Very dilapidated. Anokhi is cleaning pots. Young Wasim sits in the corner. Ajit has just wheeled Muriel into the courtyard. 
MURIEL 
(TO ANOKHI) I wanted to tell you something... Anokhi looks up. 
MURIEL (CONT'D) 
(TO AJIT) Tell her. Tell her I was glad to come, glad she invited me. Ajit translates. 
MURIEL (CONT'D) Glad to meet her family. Her grandmother. Her kids. Ajit translates. Anokhi speaks. 
AJIT She asks if you have children? 
MURIEL I looked after somebody else's. Ajit translates. 
MURIEL (CONT'D) This one family, years I was with them. I ran the house, looked after the money, did it all, cared for them like they were my own. Ajit starts to translate. But Muriel doesn't wait. 
MURIEL (CONT'D) That's the mistake, see. You don't want to get like that, to start feeling part of something. One day they decided I needed some help. I was grateful, I tried to teach her. Not just the books, but how to crisp up the bacon like the gentleman preferred it, the way the little one liked to have her hair brushed. The things you only know if you care. But then they said I was no longer useful to them. Thanked me for my service. As if that's all it was. 
(BEAT) I got a flat in the end. I'm the only one in the building not a foreigner. More Indians there than here! But before I came to this place, my biggest problem was what to do with all the time I had. Because that flat's so small, I can have the whole place spotless in half an hour. And then what am I supposed to do for the rest of the day? There's silence for a bit. Then Ajit speaks. 
AJIT Did you want me translate that as well? Muriel smiles. It's the first time we've seen this. Muriel stops, thrusts something into Ajit's hand. 
MURIEL Give her these. 
Ajit hands Anokhi what Muriel gave him: a packet of Chocolate Hobnobs. This time it's Muriel who cannot meet Anokhi's eye. Tries to hide her desire to leave. Ajit turns her chair and pushes her away. Over this, the sound of singing 
113 EXT. ROOFTOP. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 113 
Norman's on his rooftop, under the primitive spout of water that passes as his shower. Hanging from a nail in the wall, the battery radio is pumping out a bizarre Indian cover version of the Chic song "Le Freak". Norman is naked, and singing along lustily. 
NORMAN Aaaaaah, freak out! Le freak, c'est chic .. Aaaah, freak out! Feet slapping in the soapy water, he performs a nifty disco move. 
114 INT. SONNY'S OFFICE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 114 
Sonny is in his office, going through the accounts. There's a strange ringing somewhere nearby. He pays no attention, then stops and thinks for a moment. Then realises what it is. He sweeps the pile of papers off the desk, starts frantically looking for the telephone. 
115 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 115 
Graham and Evelyn are having drinks. 
EVELYN I've been getting out and about as much as I can, but I feel I've hardly scratched the surface. And of course I'd love to see Udaipur. The lake you talked about. 
GRAHAM I'd love to take you. Perhaps - He breaks off. Douglas and Jean have come in. Jean looks rather desperate. 
EVELYN AND DOUGLAS 
(SIMULTANEOUSLY) Good evening. 
81A. An awkward moment. Graham stands. 
GRAHAM Good evening, Mrs Ainslie. Please allow me. He pulls a chair out for her. She shoots him a look of passionate gratitude for his exquisite sensitivity. 
JEAN You're very kind. But I rather think I'll turn in early. Goodnight everyone. She goes into her room. 
116 EXT. COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 116 
Muriel is sitting outside her room, doing the crossword. Madge is coming through the arch, stops dead. Norman is standing in front of her, on his way out. He looks transformed. And rather handsome. 
MADGE Is this it? 
NORMAN This is it. 
MADGE You're not worried about the danger of having sex at your age? Norman shrugs. 
NORMAN If she dies, she dies. He leaves. Sonny sprints into the courtyard. 
SONNY Progress, Mrs Donnelly, Mrs Hardcastle! The wheel is turning most assuredly in our favour! He shoots up the stairs. 
117 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING. 117 
Douglas, Graham and Evelyn are looking at the menu. Sonny bursts in. 
SONNY Mr Dashwood! Everybody! Great news! 
GRAHAM What is it, Sonny? 
Sonny is sleeping peacefully. 
123 EXT. COURTYARD, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 123 
Sunaina moves across the courtyard. Not sneaking, exactly. But making no sound. 
124 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 124 
Sonny sleeps on. 
125 INT. CORRIDOR, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 125 
Sunaina is definitely sneaking now. She aims down the passage towards Sonny's room. 
126 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 126 
Sonny stirs, but doesn't wake up. 
127 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 127 
Sunaina comith esno te bedroom. She takes off her clothes. And climbs, naked, into bed beside the sleeping figure. 
128 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 128 
A loud scream. In a different bed, in a different room, Sonny wakes up. And remembers. 
129 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 129 
It's Sunaina that's screamed. Because she's in bed with Madge. Who couldn't be happier. 
MADGE A midnight booty call. How utterly marvellous. 
130 INT. CORRIDOR, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 130 
Sonny hares out of his temporary bedroom, and races down the corridor, towards Madge's room. 
131 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 131 
Sunaina has jumped out of the bed and across the room, grabbing one of Madge's generous scarves to cover her nakedness. 
SUNAINA I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry . I don't know what your name is, but I'm incredibly sorry. 
MADGE Don't be. Most action I've had in weeks. 
SUNAINA If you could just please not 
MENTION - Sonny bursts in. 
SONNY Do not worry, Mrs Hardcastle! I can explain each and every thing! Hesees Sunaina. 
SONNY (CONT'D) Oh my god you are naked. He turns to Madge. 
SONNY (CONT'D) Mrs Hardcastle, I must apologise with deep and profound sincerity - 
SUNAINA How could you not tell me you weren't in your room! 
SONNY Yes, Sunaina, to you too I must apologise with equally deep and profound sincerity. Now go. Get out. Quickly. 
SUNAINA I'm going. Just let me get dressed, and - 
SONNY No no, quicker than that. You must leave, before - MrsKapoor flings open the door. 
MRS KAPOOR What is going on here? Who screamed? She sees the nearly-naked Sunaina. MRS KAPOOR (cont'd) No no no no no. No! This is a respectable hotel, not a brothel. 
(TO SUNAINA) You, get out. 
(TO MADGE) And Mrs Hardcastle, I expected better of you. Actually, this is exactly what I expected of you, but nevertheless - 
SUNAINA Mrs Kapoor, I'm Sunaina. 
MRS KAPOOR Since I will not be paying for your services, your name is of no interest to me. 
(BEAT) How do you know mine? Sunaina is shocked to realise that Mrs Kapoor doesn't know her name. Sonny steps forward reluctantly. 
SONNY Because this . is my Sunaina. 
MRS KAPOOR The girl who my son described as not too modern. 
MADGE This is getting interesting. 
MRS KAPOOR 
139 EXT. GARDEN, MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 139 
Graham is still sitting in the garden. 
EVELYN (O.S.) You're back. He doesn't turn round. Evelyn has come out to the garden. She goes over to him. 
EVELYN (CONT'D) It's been rather an extraordinary night all round. First tell me your news, and then - She breaks off. Graham is dead. 
139A EXT. COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 139A 
EVELYN (V.0.) Day 45. Of course it was inevitable. Put enough old people in the same place, it won't be too long before one of them goes... Jean, Douglas, Madge, Norman and Muriel shocked and sobered 
140 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 140 
A train is crossing the endless fields. 
141 INT. TRAIN - DAY 141 
Evelyn stares out of the window. Madge, Norman, Douglas and Jean are behind her. Opposite sits Manoj. Evelyn turns to look at him, and at Gaurika, Manoj's wife, who sits beside him. 
EVELYN (V.0.) We all know it'll happen, but few of us know when. Graham died of a heart attack, evidently not his first. So he had a better idea than most what was coming, he just neglected to tell us. His prerogative. 
142 EXT. LAKE - DAWN 142 
Three white vehicles are driving across a narrow causeway, which barely rises above the surface of the lake. They seem to be floating. Clouds of dust billow behind them. 
EVELYN (V.0.) There was talk of sending the body home, but Manoj felt he should have a Hindu burial. At the place they had visited together. Not a holy place. Although for them perhaps it was. 
143 EXT. FUNERAL PYRE, RUINS - DAY 143 
A ruined garden, surrounded by the waters of the lake, crumbling pillared porticoes and arches. What must once have been a royal retreat is now long abandoned and overgrown. Graham's friends stand watching the pyre, transfixed by the flames. Manoj, dressed in white, stands with Gaurika. He recites a Hindi prayer. 
EVELYN (V.0.) A body takes a long time to be consumed. Many hours for the mourners to remember their dead. The fire must be lit at dawn, and by sunset, there must be nothing left but ash. 
144 EXT. LAKESIDE - SUNSET 144 
Stripped to the waist, Manoj walks into the water, holding a bowl. 
EVELYN (V.0.) Where do our souls go? is that all of us that is left behind? Perhaps the most we can ask is that when we do shuffle off, we do so knowing that we were loved Manoj pours Graham onto the water. The ashes shim r and dance, caught in the gentle currents. 
145 EXT. SERVANT'S GARDEN. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 145 
Muriel and Anokhi are in the servants' garden. Young Wasim sits silently in the corner. 
MURIEL So there's a process, they call it pickling. I have no idea what it is, or how they do it, but whoever invented it was a smart man. But the real genius was the one who introduced an onion into the system. That I could never have thought of. 
Ajit looks at her, ready to translate. 
MURIEL (CONT'D) No, forget it. Muriel is looking out at the yard. She sees Mrs Kapoor, talking to some surveyors. They're mapping out the building. Mrs Kapoor sees Muriel watching her, comes over to them. 
MRS KAPOOR Mrs Donnelly, what are you doing here? You should not be here, talking with this one. 
MURIEL I'm helping her clean. If these pots get any dirtier, you'll have to serve the food with penicillin. 
MRS KAPOOR We have other rooms. Go to one of them instead. While this is still a hotel. She turns back to the surveyors. 
MURIEL 
(TO AJIT) What's her problem? What's happening here? Ajit can't answer. But he knows a man who can. He points to Young Wasim. 
AJIT He can tell you. 
146 EXT. ROOFTOP BAR, BHARATPUR PALACE HOTEL. UDAIPUR - 146 
EVENING A stunning view over the city. Madge is having a drink with Norman. Douglas is sitting on the wall, but keeps looking down towards the stairs. 
MADGE When someone dies, you think about your own life. And in my case, there is less of it in front of me than behind. And I don't want to grow older. I don't want to be condescended to, ignored and marginalised by society. To become peripheral to the action. 
(MORE) 
MADGE (coat' d) I don't want to be the first person let off the plane in a hostage crisis. They laugh together. And don't even see Douglas go. 
147 EXT. LANDING. BHARATPUR PALACE HOTEL - EVENING 147 
The landing is large, and open to the sky. Evelyn has just come up the stairs to go to her room. She's leaning against the stone baluster. 
DOUGLAS I wondered where you'd been. Evelyn turns. Douglas is on the stairs above her. 
DOUGLAS (CONT'D) We're all up top, having a drink. 
EVELYN I went to see Gaurika. Manoj's wife. I wanted to ask her what she knew. And the answer was that she knew everything, that he'd loved another man, and always would. He told her when the marriage was arranged. 
SONNY (Glancing back for a moment) Working for me, Mr Maruthi. To create a home for the elderly so wonderful that they will simply refuse to die! Stare death in the face and say- 
(MORE) 
98A. 
SONNY (CONT'D) (follows Mr Maruthi's 
GAZE) What are those men doing? 
151 EXT. KITCHEN/SERVANT'S GARDEN. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 151 
Moments later. Through the window, Muriel watches Sonny confronting his mother. 
SONNY Mummyji, what is going on here? 
MRS KAPOOR I have spoken to your brothers. They want to sell the hotel. These men are here to value the building. 
SONNY They are valuing the land. My brothers do not care about the building. They will knock it down. 
MRS KAPOOR They could just wait a month for it to fall down of its own accord. 
SONNY You joke, Mummyji, but inside I know you are not laughing. You do not want to see this dream destroyed. Send these people away. 
MRS KAPOOR No, my son. It is too late. 
152 INT. SONNY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 152 
Mrs Kapoor is at the desk, going through the accounts. Sonny stands opposite her. 
SONNY Mummyji, please - 
MRS KAPOOR These figures do not support your argument. 
SONNY There is still time to turn things around. With a small injection of funds, we can - 
MRS KAPOOR Who is trusting you with that money? Eh? You, who cannot run a chai stand. Just like your father. 
Beat. Then Sonny speaks quietly. 
SONNY Do I remind you of him so much? Is that why you must be cruel to me? 
MRS KAPOOR You think I am cruel? 
SONNY You loved my father. And he loved this hotel. 
MRS KAPOOR 
(FIERCELY) Two mistakes. There will not be a third. 
(BEAT) Say goodbye to all this, Sonny. And come with me to Delhi. Your life will become easier. 
SONNY Not easier, Mummyji. Smaller. He leaves. Mrs Kapoor comes back to the desk, fiddling with some paperwork, discomfited. She turns to the doorway. Muriel is there, in her chair. 
MRS KAPOOR Mrs Donnelly. Can I help you? 
MURIEL Depends. Do you know how to use a computer? 
MRS KAPOOR I assume you are joking. 
MURIEL Mrs Ainslie said she had an address where I could get some things I need. Some biscuits. She said I could get them on the line. 
MRS KAPOOR I wish you luck. Mrs Kapoor smiles, and leaves. Muriel watches her go, then turns to the computer. Her fingers fly across the keyboard. 
153 INT. TRAIN - NIGHT 153 
The train rattles its way through the night. Jean is chatting away, in a better mood than we've seen her for some time. Evelyn listens in silence. 
JEAN The whole thing is actually tremendously exciting. Not just getting on a plane, but getting on a plane and turning left. 
NORMAN Turning left? 
JEAN First class. And home in time for our 40th wedding anniversary. We haven't yet decided how to mark the occasion. 
MADGE Perhaps a minute's silence? 
154 INT. SONNY'S OFFICE, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 154 
Ajit keeps watch, while Muriel is at the printer. Waiting as it disgorges pages. 
155 OMITTED 155 
SONNY She is no longer my girlfriend. 
EVELYN This is a disaster. 
SONNY Then we must treat it just the same as we would treat a triumph, is that not what your Mr Kipling tells us? Although of course, here we have a problem. Because I, Sunil Indrajit Kapoor, have never had a triumph, so of course I do not know how to treat one. No, all I have had is an constant series of disasters interspersed with the occasional catastrophe, an unending stream of total - 
EVELYN Sonny, do you love her? Sunaina? 
SONNY Most deeply. 
EVELYN Have you told her you love her? 
SONNY It is because I love her that I must not tell her. She can do so much better than me. 
EVELYN And you have told her that? 
SONNY Many times. 
EVELYN Good. Women love it when you say that kind of thing. It's a powerful aphrodisiac. 
SONNY Really? 
EVELYN No, of course not. Go and find her right now, before you lose her forever. Her future is hers to choose, and so is yours. You can have anything you want, Sonny. You just need to stop waiting for someone to tell you you deserve it. Or you can just keep failing yourself, and hurting the ones you love - 
SONNY Mrs Greenslade, stop drilling! You have struck oil! He goes to his bike, climbs on, and rockets off. 
161 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 161 
Madge is sitting, pensive. Carol comes in. 
MADGE Where's Norman? 
CAROL Packing. 
MADGE But we don't have to leave yet. 
CAROL I asked him to come and stay with me. 
MADGE Is that wise? I'm not sure he's trained. 
CAROL You think it's too soon. 
MADGE It doesn't matter what I think. 
CAROL It is too soon. But at our age we can't afford the luxury of taking it slow. And it's either this or he goes home and I don't want him to go home. Madge looks at her for a while. Then smiles. 
MADGE I wish you both the very best. 
CAROL You haven't met anyone? 
MADGE Single by choice. Just not my choice. 
(BEAT) I actually think it might be over. For me. With men. And if that's gone, I'm not quite sure what's left. 
BEAT 
CAROL Did you know Norman brought pills? The first night he stayed with me? 
MADGE They obviously did the trick. 
CAROL I saw them in his pocket. I didn't want it to be like that. So when I had the chance I swapped them. 
(BEAT) 
(MORE) 
106A. 
CAROL (CONT'D) He went all night on two aspirin. 
(BEAT) It's never over. Norman appears with his one bag and his battery radio. 
NORMAN Ready? 
162 EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 162 
Sonny roars through the streets on his bike. 
163 EXT. STREET. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 163 
Evelyn approaches. She sees a taxi waiting outside the hotel. 
SUNAINA Including your mother? 
JAY 
(TO SONNY) Including my mother? 
SUNAINA His mother. 
JAY 
(TO SONNY) Your mother. 
SONNY I will tell every mother in the land. 
SUNAINA 
(TO JAY) What will you tell them? 
JAY 
(TO SONNY) What will you tell them? 
SONNY The only thing that matters in this world. That I love you. And always will. 
(BEAT) And by you, I mean Sunaina, Jay, not you. Although if you are to be my brother-in-law, I hope we can become better friends. 
SUNAINA Why is he only saying this now? 
JAY 
(TO SUNAINA) You ask him. 
SUNAINA Why are you only saying this now? 
SONNY Because, Sunaina, love of my life, no more will I believe that I am not worthy, for only by loving you as you deserve will I become so. On Sunaina's face as she hears this. 
173 EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 173 
The cacophonous sound of drumming: a small band of players are beating out a deafening, syncopated rhythm as the Ganeshi festival begins to unfold. Sonny is on his bike, Sunaina riding side-saddle on the back. They're speeding through the city. Sonny rockets through an arch way up a side street, is confronted by a huge traffic jam. The Ganeshi procession is bringing everything to a standstill. He does a U-turn, speeds off back the way they came. 
174 INT/EXT. TAXI/STREET - DAY 174 
Douglas and Jean are sitting in the traffic jam. 
DOUGLAS It's funny. They call it rush hour, but nothing actually moves. 
(BEAT) It's not that funny. 
(BEAT) Although I suppose it's all about context, isn't it? I mean - 
JEAN Douglas? 
DOUGLAS Yes? 
JEAN If you say one more word, I'll kill you with my thumbs. 
174A EXT. COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 174A 
Muriel sits alone in the courtyard, under her awning. Then Carol and Norman appear from reception, followed by Mrs Kapoor. They cross towards the arch. 
MURIEL Where d'you think you're going? 
MADGE You may well ask. Madge is sitting under the shade of a tree.. 
NORMAN We're moving in together. 
MURIEL Already? 
CAROL That point has been made. 
MRS KAPOOR The hotel is closing. 
MURIEL Doesn't have to. Silence. Everyone stares at Muriel. She takes out the spreadsheets. 
MURIEL (CONT'D) I've been going over the accounts. 
174B EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 174B 
If anything, the traffic is now worse. Jean and Douglas's taxi has progressed a few yards, and is now wedged into the arch. The Ganeshi procession is completely blocking the far entrance to the archway. Jean gets out, looks at the sea of unmoving traffic ahead and behind. 
JEAN This is ridiculous. It could go on for hours. There's no way we're ever going to get out of here. 
MADGE What is he saying? 
MURIEL What he said to me, I imagine. She turns to Sunaina. 
MURIEL (CON'TD) Can you help? 
SUNAINA He is saying . he is saying that he has been with this family as long as he can remember. Given them a lifetime of service. And that he remembers another fight, between two young people and their parents. And he remembers the moment where the young man stood up to his mother 
MRS KAPOOR . and said yes, I want to marry this woman. Yes, she is from a different community. But she is smart, she is beautiful, and I love her. Long pause. MRS KAPOOR (cont'd) I don't know who he's talking about. She offers Sunaina her hand. MRS KAPOOR (cont'd) Take care of my favourite son. Sunaina shakes her hand. 
NORMAN So I'm not clear now. Am I staying or going? 
MURIEL Depends how you read the accounts. 
SONNY The accounts? 
MURIEL Turns out the original plan is good, it works. Just not in the hands of an imbecile. 
SONNY I knew that plan was good! 
MURIEL What the place needs is more money. 
SONNY Unfortunately my investor, Mr Maruthi has decided that while he greatly admires my endeavors, he 
CANNOT - 
MURIEL He's reconsidered. 
SONNY You spoke to him? 
MURIEL So long as there is someone to help the manager. 
SONNY The manager needs no help. 
SUNAINA Sonny... 
SONNY The manager needs a little help. 
MURIEL 
(TO NORMAN) So will you stay? Norman looks at Carol. 
NORMAN I'd like to. 
CAROL In the shack on the roof? 
NORMAN I sleep in the trees. 
SONNY 
(TO CAROL) We have a double room. Bathroom ensuite. And a fully working door. He points to Graham's room. 
SONNY (CONT'D) A guest has recently checked out. Madge can't believe he just said that. 
CAROL I'll think about it. 
MURIEL 
(TO MADGE) Mrs Hardcastle ? You're staying. 
MADGE On my own? 
MURIEL You're off your game. Lost your confidence, maybe. But you're a thoroughbred. You'll be back. Madge smiles. 
MURIEL (CON'TD) And what about you, Mrs Greenslade? Evelyn has come down, unnoticed by all. Except Muriel. 
EVELYN What about me, Mrs Donnelly? 
MURIEL We haven't talked much, you and 
I. 
EVELYN My loss, evidently. 
(BEAT) I'm not sure what I should do. Nothing here has quite worked out as I hoped. 
117A. 
MURIEL Most things don't. But sometimes what happens instead is the good stuff. 
(BEAT)

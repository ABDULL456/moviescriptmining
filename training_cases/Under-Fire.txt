SHOOTING DRAFT 
SOMEWHERE IN AFRICA 
EXT. GRASSY PLAINS - DUSK 
BIRDS ARE FLUSHED FROM HIDING. A soldier carrying an automatic weapon rises up out of the grass and looks around. A mortar shell explodes nearby. There are no sound effects. He seems unperturbed. 
Several more explosions in the field. The soldier motions with his arm and: 
FIFTY MORE SOLDIERS RISE UP OUT OF THE GRASS More small explosions. 
FREEZE FRAME 
With a click-click of a camera -- still no fx. 
THE SOLDIERS RUN THROUGH THE GRASS FOLLOWING THEIR LEADER As they do, the platoon leader waves his arms again. 
FIVE ELEPHANTS CHARGE OUT OF THE SHRUBBERY Through a field of small mortar explosions. 
FREEZE FRAME 
With the click-click of a camera. 
THE ELEPHANTS CHARGE OUT ACROSS THE PLAINS Each carries an enormous load of supplies, and each is ridden by a soldier with a rifle. 
A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP DIVES OUT OF THE SKY firing rockets at the soldiers and elephants. A tribal mask is painted on the nose of the chopper. 
THE ELEPHANTS REAR UP IN TERROR 
The soldiers on the elephants stand up and aim rifles at the chopper and begin firing. 
THE CHOPPER ATTACKS THE ELEPHANTS against an African sunset.

DISSOLVE TO: 
INT./EXT. LOBBY OF THE 'NEW PEOPLE'S HOTEL' - DAWN 
A door slams o.s. and the figure of RUSSELL PRICE, 30, appears at the top of some stairs. Sleepy-eyed, he pulls on a multi- pocketed fishing vest over a baggy shirt. He carries a beat up canvas bag over his shoulder. 
A BLACK WOMAN, 40, sleeps at the lobby switchboard desk. Another OLD BLACK MAN sweeps the floor. Price mumbles a 'good morning' and goes to two vintage WW II vending machines -- one for candy, one for Coca-Cola. He buys two candy bars and a coke, and begins eating his "breakfast" as he crosses the lobby. 
EXT. THE HOTEL - DAWN 
JIMMY, a cab driver, has been sleeping in a chair against the wall. Several street vendors have their wares laid out on the sidewalk against the hotel. Some are shaded by makeshift awnings, some are not. Jimmy rises as Price arrives; there is familiar ritual in their greeting. 
They cross the street together toward Jimmy's waiting taxi, a hand-painted purple old American car with the words on the door, "New People's Taxi Company" and Jimmy's name in script above it. Price hands a candy bar to Jimmy. 
PRICE 'Morning, Jimmy, think you could squeeze me in? 
JIMMY Where is you would care to go at once, Mr. Price? 
PRICE Bang-bang. 
JIMMY Twenty dollar. 
Price hands him a wad of bills. 
PRICE You're a thief, Jimmy. 
Jimmy smiles broadly, nodding, then points to the sky. 
JIMMY Booteeful picture, huh, snap-snap? 
PRICE I don't do skies. 
The two men get into the strange cab parked in front of an open marketplace just starting to come alive; the cab drives off. 
EXT. A REMOTE AFRICAN VILLAGE - DAY 
The taxi arrives, and Price gets out. 
Price ambles over to stand in the early morning shade against an old building. A hand-painted image of Che Guevarra -- with an X painted over it -- is on one wall. Price pulls a joint from his pocket and lights up, taking a hit. 
The sounds of war machinery soon interrupt the stillness. Price hurries to the corner. 
P.O.V. A JEEP LEADING AN ARMY CONVOY 
Oates emerges and meets Price on the torn up runway amidst the rubble. They look around at the devastation. 
OATES Well, I guess we know where the Guvmint is. 
PRICE (cynically) You can walk to work from here. 
OATES Convenient, ain't it? 
Oates starts to walk away, then stops and speaks earnestly, as if trying to connect to a real world that doesn't exist. 
OATES My brother just got married. 
PRICE I don't know your brother. 
Suddenly, the distant roar of a jet. All the soldiers on the field scan the horizon; Price looks up. The air raid siren goes off. 
A JET DIVES OUT OF THE SKY TOWARD THE AIRFIELD OATES AND THE SOLDIERS DIVE TO COVER 
JET STREAKS OVERHEAD and, instead of rockets and bombs, it drops something else: 
THE SKY IS FILLED WITH A MILLION PIECES OF PAPER The jet pulls out and disappears. All is quiet again as the million papers flutter in the sky above the airfield. 
Out of frustration a single soldier fires a couple of shots at the paper. 
Price grabs a piece of paper out of the air. It is: 
A PICTURE OF A SWIMMING POOL IN FRONT OF A CALIFORNIA HOUSE 
HE STARES AT THE IMAGE and turns it over. There is writing on the backside in Spanish and Russian. He looks around. 
OATES WANDERS OVER with a handful of the leaflets. 
PRICE What's this? 
OATES Great shit, eh? 
Price tries to read the writing on the back as Oates looks at a leaflet familiarly. 
OATES U.S. Gummint offers this house to any Cuban pilot flying Migs for the Rebels who chooses to defect to America with a Russian jet. We know they ain't gonna run off with no planes -- but the Rebs don't -- They're scared. They start thinking about that swimming pool. Damn near smell that chlorine. Starts workin' on 'em, and pretty soon they don't let the Cubies near a Mig. Use their own spook pilots and destroy their own air force in a week. Guaran-fuckin- teed. 
PRICE C.I.A.? 
OATES (proudly) Smartest guys in the world. (afterthought) Hey, you gotta scoop here, eh? You'll be famous. 
OATES shakes hands with Price who looks at the picture. 
PRICE (dispassionately) Maybe. 
OATES (looking around) I gotta run... have a good one. 
Oates heads off across the runway as papers continue blowing down out of the sky; Price looks up and speaks to himself. 
PRICE I love Africa. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL ROOMS AT THE NEW PEOPLE'S HOTEL - NIGHT 
CLAIRE STRYDER, 40, reads a report over the telephone as she times the call with a stopwatch. A photograph of Claire's high-school-aged daughter sits on her dresser. 
ALEX GRAZIER, 50, struggles with his tie and a drink at a dresser in the adjoining room. Their connected rooms are littered with hand washed laundry and the paraphernalia of their trade -- typewriters, tape decks, books, notes, pictures. 
Their love affairs of three years is ending. 
CLAIRE (on the phone) "...and so this strange war that features two provincial governments, three rival liberation fronts, and at least twenty-five tribal associations, grinds into its seventh year..." 
Alex picks up a Melodica, a novelty wind instrument, and tries to court her with "Caravan" as she files her story. Though mildly put off, she maintains her cool throughout the call. He thinks he's Paul Desmond. 
CLAIRE "...The Battle for the Airfield at Abou Deia is just another chapter in this endless story. From Ndjamena, Chad, this is Claire Stryder." (beat) No -- you didn't hear any music -- must be the connection. Okay? So long. 
She hangs up and rises more irritated than angered. 
CLAIRE Alex, don't play that God damn thing when I'm filing. (beat) We're late. 
Quickly expressed, her anger passes. 
ALEX It's my party -- we'll be late. You called it a "strange war" and an "endless story." If you filed that story for me, I'd say you were editorialishing. 
CLAIRE I like to editorialize. You drunk? 
Alex loves to be melo-dramatic and is quite conscious of his ability to charm. He's also aware that it's worn off with her. 
ALEX Drunk? Only with the memories of making love with you on the plains of Fianga as the first Army of Liberation marched in and opened fire. 
CLAIRE And freed the Proletariat. 
Alex raises a drink. 
ALEX Right. 
A ROW OF HANGING PHOTOGRAPHS catches her eye. She stops and looks closely -- then laughs in spite of herself at a series of pictures: PHOTO OF A TALL AFRICAN NATIVE WITH A COCK SO LONG IT IS TIED IN A KNOT; PHOTO OF A BEAUTIFULLY BREASTED AFRICAN WOMAN; PHOTO OF SEVERAL POSING SOLDIERS; PHOTO OF A PHOTO -- THE RANCH HOUSE WITH POOL; PHOTO SELF-PORTRAIT OF PRICE BLOWING SMOKE RINGS; PHOTO OF CLAIRE AND ALEX IN HAPPIER DAYS. 
CLAIRE PULLS THE PHOTO OF ALEX AND HER from the clip and looks at it. 
THE DOOR OPENS, AND PRICE ENTERS 
PRICE Oh. I didn't know you were here. 
CLAIRE Sure you did. You were taking pictures of me all over the room. 
PRICE Well... yeah... you looked great. Why aren't you partying? 
CLAIRE In a minute. 
He notices the picture she's looking at. 
PRICE I printed that up for Alex. 
CLAIRE It wouldn't be the greatest thing you could give him right now... (beat) We just split up. 
PRICE Jesus, I'm sorry. Who left who this time? 
CLAIRE I'm the villain... I thought it could be a little cleaner this time -- me in Central America, him in New York. 
PRICE That's pretty clean. 
CLAIRE But he's decided to go to Nicaragua too. 
PRICE To cover you or the war? 
CLAIRE To cover everything. 
Silence. Price moves behind her and gently kisses her on the ear. She smiles quickly and nervously. 
CLAIRE No. 
He kisses her on the neck. 
CLAIRE For godsakes, Russell, listen. 
The sounds of the party can be heard. He ignores them and moves around her, trying to kiss her on the lips. She puts her hand over his mouth. 
Price reacts strongly, flaring slightly and withdrawing. 
PRICE I don't want to wait for you again. We've been circling each other since the Montreal Olympics. 
CLAIRE You're a genius of bad timing. (beat) I'm going back to the party. 
She heads to the door; Price stays. She stops before getting there, hesitates, then pulls the PHOTO OF THE ELEPHANT from the string and returns to Price, handing him the photo. 
CLAIRE This is a great shot. 
PRICE Thanks. 
CLAIRE I've heard the light in Nicaragua's even better. 
He doesn't respond. They stand for several moments -- the sounds of the party get louder. She turns and heads to Alex's celebration, leaving Price alone in the darkroom. 
PRICE LOOKS AT CLAIRE AS SHE LEAVES, stares aimlessly for several moments, then focuses back on his PHOTO OF THE ELEPHANTS. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
NICARAGUA 1979 
EXT. THE STREETS OF MANAGUA - THE CAPITOL - AFTERNOON 
CLOSE ON: TIME MAGAZINE WITH COVER PHOTO OF THE ELEPHANTS, gradually PULL BACK to reveal other magazines, candy, cigars, Nicaraguan toys, all in a corner shop, and finally: 
A FIRE TRUCK LEADS A PROCESSION through the streets -- a group of middle class Nicaraguan women carry a banner that reads "Our Revolution is in Christ" (in Spanish), followed by three Catholic PRIESTS in bright robes, followed by a sound truck with P.A. system, followed by hundreds of townspeople carrying banana leaves and religious signs. All are singing a Catholic hymn in a swaying, hypnotic rhythm. Small red and black flags are scattered throughout. 
A CAB DRIVING THROUGH THE STREETS runs into the parade and stops. Price sits in the front seat -- his luggage is tied precariously to the roof. The trunk of the cab has been smashed in beyond repair. Price hops out of the cab with his camera bag -- he doesn't know what the parade is about but it looks great. He hands the cabbie some money to stay nearby. 
PRICE Wait here. 
He runs to join the procession. 
PRICE HOPS ONTO THE RUNNING BOARD OF THE FIRE TRUCK and almost simultaneously his light meter is out. HE is surrounded by images: SMALL GIRLS DRESSED AS ANGELS LINE THE STREET, TOWNSPEOPLE HANG FROM DOORWAYS AND WINDOWS, ICE CREAM CARTS AMONG RELIGIOUS ICONS, SOLDIERS WITH GUNS STAND IN SMALL GROUPS ALONG THE PARADE ROUTE. 
PRICE IS QUICKLY TAKING PICTURES OF EVERYTHING, changing cameras, occasionally taking a quick light reading; his actions are instinctive and automatic. Suddenly: 
TEN YOUNG TEENAGERS BURST INTO THE PARADE They wear red and black handkerchiefs, baseball caps, and strange masks. They are chanting: 
TEENAGE BOYS Rafael, Rafael, Rafael... libre o muerte... Rafael... 
A LARGE PAINTING OF THE FACE OF RAFAEL is carried aloft on a stick, draped with red and black scarves. 
PRICE PHOTOGRAPHS the boys and the painting. 
NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS SHOVE INTO THE PARADE Up and down the street they spring into action, running for position with their guns. 
She starts to leave again, and again he stops her. 
PRICE Just one more thing -- is Rafael owned by the C.I.A. or the K.G.B.? I'll figure out the rest. 
Isela seems to welcome the question. Her tone is less flip, and she focuses hard on Price. 
ISELA Mr. Price... the world is not divided into East and West anymore. It is divided into North and South. By the time you people figure that out -- it will be too late. (beat) Congratulations on your cover. 
She touches his Time magazine, kisses Alex on the cheek, and floats magically through the pool area. 
Price frames her with his fingers as if composing a shot. 
P.O.V. OF ISELA THROUGH PRICE'S FINGERS Isela kisses another journalist, grabs someone's hand, and lands gracefully at another table. 
PRICE So far this war's got it all over Africa. 
ALEX You're gonna have a ball. 
ALEX PLACES HIS HAND OVER PRICE'S "FRAME" blocking out his view of the sexy Isela. Though Alex's tone is gentle, the threat is obvious. 
ALEX Hands off. I need an interpreter more than you do right now. 
Price takes the hint. 
PRICE You still hanging in there with Claire? 
Alex chooses his words carefully and speaks slowly. 
ALEX I'm hanging in there like an interim post-war government waiting for the palace to be overrun... by younger men. 
Silence and an uneasiness that Alex intended. Price manages a smile. 
PRICE Younger men. 
Alex smiles disarmingly. 
CLAIRE RISES AT THE OPPOSITE BAR, picks up her papers, and heads straight for the two men with a bounce in her step. 
BOTH MEN ARE A BIT SURPRISED AT HER ENTRANCE and she hands a stack of mail to Alex. 
CLAIRE Hi, Alex... Russell! When did you get in? 
PRICE Just now. 
She shakes Price's hand in a friendly manner that comes out awkwardly, then races past the moment to address and entertain both men. 
CLAIRE You're not going to believe this -- I just beat you guys and everybody else here to a story... (she teases them) ...exclusive... eat your heart out. 
PRICE What'd ya get? 
CLAIRE I've just been promised a private interview with Tacho. 
ALEX (impressed) Congratulations. The bastard won't talk to me. 
PRICE Who's Tacho? 
They turn to Price as if everyone knows who Tacho is. 
CLAIRE That's President Somoza's nickname. 
PRICE I don't know who the players are yet. 
ALEX Want me to order you a hot dog and a program? 
A bit of tension and awkwardness -- Claire quickly takes control and changes the tone. 
CLAIRE Fellas! No fighting after six at night, all right? Curfew. (beat) C'mon, we've all got something to celebrate. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE VIKING CLUB OF MANAGUA - NIGHT 
Corrugated metal roofs, thatched hut booths, a strange combination of decorative and architectural devices. DAISY WILLIAMS, a large black woman from Nicaragua, sings "I Left My Heart in San Francisco" with a mediocre jazz group. 
HUB KITTLE is present, and other journalists drop by the table to say hello. 
A BOY PHOTOGRAPHER, 13, aims an ancient bellows type polaroid at a booth in which Claire sits between Alex and Price. They are holding a pose indefinitely while the boy struggles with the camera. They hold up the TIME COVER and a couple of beers in celebration, and when he finally snaps the picture -- no flash. 
The boy puts the camera down disappointedly. 
BOY PHOTOGRAPHER (in broken English) Sometimes it doesn't work. 
The three journalists relax their pose. 
PRICE Let me look. 
ON THE BANDSTAND Daisy has just finished "San Francisco" and spots Alex, motioning to him. 
DAISY Ladeez and Gen'mun, hep me get Aaleex ov' here... 
As we hear Alex's gentle rendition of the standard, a NECKING COUPLE moves back into the shadows of the club. Each pulls on a mask, as in the b.g.: 
ISELA AND AN ELEGANT MAN ARRIVE AT THE CLUB 
The man, somehow out of place, dresses with casual continental style, not overdone but expensive and tasteful -- clearly from another world. He wears a neat hat and moves gracefully. Isela looks stunning, dressed for the evening. The DOORMAN greets them familiarly. 
Isela casually checks her watch as they enter the club. 
The masked couple in the shadows check their watches. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE VIKING CLUB 
As Isela and the man enter, commanding attention without trying. Isela stops at the piano long enough to kiss Alex gently before sitting in the booth with the man. 
IN PRICE'S BOOTH the new arrivals have caught their attention -- Price and Alex still clown slightly, and Claire teases them. 
CLAIRE Jesus... Louis Jordan walks in, and I'm sitting with the Everly Brothers. 
REGIS Before you fall in love -- that's Marcel Jazy... friend of wine, women, and Somoza. They say he's a businessman... 
CLAIRE (interrupting) He's a businessman in search of a business... he doesn't try very hard to cover up his connections to the C.I.A... 
P.O.V. OF JAZY LIGHTING ISELA'S CIGARETTE 
CLAIRE But look at his moves -- can the C.I.A. light cigarettes like that? 
PRICE What's wrong with the Everly Brothers? 
THE WAITER ARRIVES AT PRICE'S BOOTH and sets down three shrimp cocktails and more champagne, as: 
INT. THE BACK DOOR OF THE CLUB 
It opens quickly, and three more MEN IN MASKS enter quickly. 
BACK TO THE BOOTH as the waiter speaks with a firm coolness. 
WAITER Please stay at your table, and you won't be hurt. 
A FACE IN A MASK MOVES QUICKLY PAST PRICE'S TABLE 
ANOTHER MASKED FACE COMES OUT OF THE KITCHEN The dishwasher waves a gun. 
TWO MASKED FACES -- THE COUPLE -- ENTER THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR The woman carries an automatic rifle and guards the entrance. 
THREE MASKED FACES APPEAR Almost materialize from thin air, moving silently and without commotion. The music winds down slowly. (Six Guerrillas total) 
A GUERRILLA QUICKLY SPRAYS AN IMAGE ON THE WALL With a few deftly drawn strokes, the FACE OF RAFAEL magically appears. The name "RAFAEL" is written under the face, then other names and revolutionary slogans. As this takes place: 
A WOMAN GUERRILLA HAS A GUN AT THE HEAD OF A NICARAGUAN BUSINESSMAN The middle-aged, well-dressed local sits with his wife and two other men. They freeze in fear, the nightclub freezes, as the GUERRILLAS take control of the room swiftly and smoothly. 
ONE GUERRILLA FACES THE NICARAGUAN BUSINESSMAN at the table and speaks loudly but without panic. The masked Guerrillas around the room are serious but nervous. 
GUERRILLA LEADER (in Spanish) We do not want to waste any ammunition on a head as empty as yours -- but we will. 
BUSINESSMAN (in Spanish) What is this?! 
GUERRILLA LEADER (in Spanish) Shut up! Get up! 
The BUSINESSMAN refuses. The GUERRILLA LEADER takes a hand grenade from his pocket and pulls the pin without hesitation, then holds the grenade in front of him fearlessly, inches away from the Businessman's face. 
The Businessman rises slowly. The LEADER motions toward the back door of the club. 
GUERRILLA LEADER (in Spanish) You are coming with us -- you will not be hurt -- we will trade you for the release of some Nicaraguans who care about Nicaragua. 
The woman with the gun shoves it into the man's head forcing him to move toward the kitchen door. 
PRICE TAKES PICTURES QUICKLY WITH A TINY CAMERA that fits into the palm of his hand. Neatly, surreptitiously, and calmly -- Price is coolest in any crisis. 
CLAIRE PUNCHES ON HER TINY TAPE RECORDER instinctively, and a tiny red light comes on. 
THE BUSINESSMAN IS SHOVED TO THE DOOR He hesitates, afraid to leave the room. The Guerrilla shoves the grenade in his face; the woman sticks the gun into his neck even deeper. 
MASKED GUERRILLA AT THE FRONT DOOR SHOUTS FOR THEM TO HURRY 
THE BANDMEMBERS -- INCLUDING ALEX -- BACK AWAY FROM THE BANDSTAND Alex trips over the drum set slightly -- a clanging clash of cymbals startles everyone, and as the drama freezes: 
THE KITCHEN DOOR SWINGS OPEN, AND THE BOY PHOTOGRAPHER EMERGES Innocently, the young boy struts out of the kitchen to see what's going on, and as he does the DOOR STRIKES THE ARM OF THE GUERRILLA WITH THE GRENADE, and: 
THE GRENADE IS KNOCKED FREE For an instant, everything freezes, and: 
THE GRENADE ROLLS ACROSS THE FLOOR Daisy Williams, the singer, runs away screaming as the grenade comes to rest near a crowded section of the club. 
A Guerrilla guarding the side door rushes for it, picks it up, and as he does: 
THE GRENADE EXPLODES IN THE GUERRILLA'S HAND A brutal explosion -- the ceiling caves in partially, the musical instruments explode, and: 
THE SANDINISTA GUERRILLAS DART FROM THE ROOM through various doors. The boy photographer lies bloodied. The Guerrilla who picked up the grenade is a barely recognizable corpse. The Businessman is soiled but unhurt. 
Marcel Jazy stands, drink in hand, looking slightly rumpled in the daylight, slightly older, but more charming and self- effacing than his first impression indicated. His two story Mediterranean style house is in slight disrepair; the gardens are scraggly and overgrown. The pool is empty. Jazy addresses Price and Claire. 
PRICE ...are you a spy or aren't you, eh? 
JAZY (smiling) Spy is such an odd word, Mr. Price... nobody is a... 'spy'... anymore. 
CLAIRE Russell prefers pictures to words... 
JAZY You don't have to apologize... you're journalists. 
CLAIRE And you're a businessman? 
JAZY A businessman? That sounds good. Okay, I'm a businessman. 
PRICE Why was I arrested, and why did you get me released, and who are you? 
As he speaks, the questioning comes to a sudden halt as a SPECTACULAR LOOKING WOMAN emerges from the shadows of the house into the light of the courtyard. She is tall, Latin, and besides high heels wears only a shiny, high fashion swimsuit, cut high on the legs. 
Price, Claire, and Jazy stop to watch as the woman stops to look into the empty pool. 
WOMAN IN SWIMSUIT No agua. 
JAZY (nodding) No agua. 
WOMAN IN SWIMSUIT (in Spanish) Oh, Marcel! You told me there would be water in the pool this week! 
Jazy leans in very coolly to Price and Claire as he pours an extra glass of wine and speaks softly in English again. 
JAZY If she dove in, I assure you she wouldn't notice. 
He carries the glass of wine to the woman, smiling warmly. 
JAZY (to Miss Panama in Spanish) Sweetheart, the Guerrillas knocked out the pumping station on the road to Masaya, and we must ration water for the time being. Next week maybe things will be better. 
WOMAN IN SWIMSUIT (in Spanish) Maybe I should go back to Panama. 
JAZY (in Spanish) Maybe you should. 
Jazy pushes a lounge chair over to her and hands her a glass of wine. The woman unfolds gracefully into a lounge chair in the sun. Very sexy. She reaches for and kisses Jazy's hand affectionately -- he kisses her forehead. She feels better now. 
Jazy motions for Claire and Price to follow him inside. 
INT. JAZY'S HOUSE - DAY 
The pool is visible in b.g. His house, like the pool, is rumpled and slightly sloppy though it betrays the taste of its occupant -- books everywhere, pictures on the wall, nothing cheap or tacky but everything is well worn. 
JAZY You were arrested because the Guardia are clowns who specialize in excess. You were released because I told them to release you. 
CLAIRE These are not the normal duties of a businessman. 
He looks at them directly. 
JAZY But they are the normal duties of a... spy, eh? You win, I'm a spy. (smiles) There, are you happy? I feel better. 
He refills their glasses. 
JAZY Now we can relax. You can turn off your little thing. 
The red light of her recorder is on. She smiles slightly, undisturbed, and turns it off. 
JAZY Oh, I trust you won't say anything to hurt me. In some ways I'm a terrible spy. I used to be much better at it, but now it seems everyone knows who I am. I have too many girlfriends. I like to be photographed. (beat) I talk too much. 
Price and Claire are almost afraid to speak, afraid to interrupt this strange performance. 
JAZY I always talk too much... but my girlfriends like that... No matter. (pointing to the swimsuited woman) You know who she is? 
CLAIRE AND PRICE No. 
JAZY That's Miss Panama. Do you know who that is? 
CLAIRE AND PRICE Oh, yeah, yes, etc. 
JAZY She's in love with me. I've got to get some water in the pool. (beat) And once a week I have lunch with President Somoza to discuss security measures against the Sandinista insurgents, but all he wants to talk about is Miss Panama... he's worried about her. 
Claire interrupts with a smile. 
CLAIRE Because he thinks she's seeing another man? 
Jazy smiles slightly before confirming. 
JAZY ...and he assigned me to find out who the man is. 
They all smile at this complication. Price is impressed. Jazy changes the subject with fluent and disturbing ease. 
JAZY We all know the Revolutionaries are going to win, don't we? 
Silence. They don't know how to respond. 
THEIR P.O.V. AS MISS PANAMA STRETCHES LIKE AN ENORMOUS CAT They all are slightly entertained and glad for the relief. 
THE OTHER TWO SANDINISTAS OPEN HEAVY FIRE and briefly draw heavier fire from the belltower, as: 
PEDRO PICKS UP A MUFFIN weighing it briefly in his hand, like a pitcher. He studies the surroundings -- runners on first and third, no outs -- he spits in his left (his pitching hand) and rubs it in casually. 
Pedro crosses himself, goes into an abbreviated pitching motion, then rears and fires the 'muffin' toward the belltower window, exposing himself as he does. 
AN EXPLOSION IN THE TOWER 
PEDRO THROWS ANOTHER INTO THE TOWER -- another explosion. 
A GUARDIA SOLDIER STAGGERS INTO THE WINDOW and a Sandinista drops him with a shot. 
All is quiet. 
THE THREE SANDINISTAS CAREFULLY RUSH THE TOWER, looking in and motion to Pedro and Price that all is okay, and as they do: 
ANOTHER SHOT RINGS OUT -- they whirl around -- Pedro and Price drop again. A lone Guardia soldier fires at them from the other tower. 
A THIRD SANDINISTA DROPS HIM WITH A VOLLEY OF FIRE Again all is quiet. 
PRICE FOLLOWS THE SANDINISTAS TO THE FIRST BELLTOWER and looks in. 
FIVE BODIES LIE SCATTERED AND BLOODIED One of the Guerrillas kicks a couple of them to make sure they are dead. In the corner, one body lies on top of another. Satisfied, the Sandinistas head for the other tower. 
PRICE STAYS BEHIND TO TAKE A FEW PICTURES and the ever-present light meter appears, followed by several quick shots of the bodies. Then Price goes to one of the arched, stone windows. He looks out over the city. 
P.O.V. OF LEON -- DUSK Late in the afternoon now, the fighting is over for the day. An occasional gunshot. Smoke rises from scattered places throughout the city. There is new rubble. The town is littered with bodies. 
P.O.V. THE RED CROSS WAGON MOVING THROUGH THE STREET 
A man walks in front of it, chanting slowly, rhythmically: 
RED CROSS MAN Hay heridas o muertes aqui? Hay heridas o muertes aqui? (Are there wounded or dead here?) 
We see a woman drag a body out into the street. The Red Cross man makes small stacks of bodies. He douses the bodies with gasoline and sets the pile aflame. Then continues. 
RED CROSS MAN Hay heridas o muertes aqui? 
Price watches. He thinks he hears something, then dismisses it. Something else. A voice, almost a whisper. 
VOICE Price. You motherfucker, Price, I'm talking to you. 
He turns. One of the bodies speaks. 
VOICE Where are those bastards... are they away? 
Price looks out -- the Sandinistas are on the other side of the roof. This war gets stranger. 
PRICE They're away. 
A body rolls out from under another body. Blood-splattered, smiling, wiping the blood from his face. It is Oates, the mercenary from Africa. He peeks out the window -- the Sandinistas are on the other side of the roof. He whispers. 
OATES What the fuck are you doing here? 
PRICE What the fuck are you doing here? 
For a moment they understand that they are there for the same reason -- they make their livings off war. Oates peeks out the window nervously and repeatedly. 
OATES Awright, awright -- you're lookin' good... how ya like Nicaragua? 
OATES readies his automatic weapon in case it's needed -- routine. Price doesn't know how to answer. 
PRICE It's beautiful. 
Oates laughs quickly and softly -- he is tuned into the strangeness of Price's answer. 
OATES Shitload o' greasers though, eh? 
P.O.V. THE SANDINISTAS HEADING BACK TOWARD US 
OATES AND PRICE SEE THEM, and Oates crawls back under the pile of bodies. 
THE SANDINISTAS LOOK INTO THE BELLTOWER, all looks quiet, and they motion to Price. 
SANDINISTA #1 (in Spanish) It's getting late -- come on. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL - DUSK 
The Three Sandinistas, Pedro, and Price are hiding in the shadows of the main church entrance. The Sandinistas are carefully peeking around the corner, checking out the plaza. It seems safe. The door opens; the Priest lets Claire out. For a moment she looks around to see who's still alive -- in the shadows Price looks like one of the Guerrillas. They see each other and embrace briefly. 
CLAIRE You're okay? 
The Sandinistas seem to relax. The Sandinistas take pride in Pedro and pat his left arm for Price and Claire. 
SANDINISTA #1 San-dee Koufax, no? 
SANDINISTA #2 Si, Koufax. 
CLAIRE Yes. 
Silence. They lie for a long time in the dark. A light in the house is turned off. Finally: 
PRICE Are you asleep? 
CLAIRE No. 
Price gets out of the hammock and lies down next to her. They don't speak. They kiss. She unbuttons his shirt. He unbuttons her blouse. They undress just enough to begin making love softly, quietly. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. PRICE AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - DAWN 
The first light of dawn strikes Claire's bare torso. 
PRICE'S LIGHT METER APPEARS AT HER BACK Price takes a reading, then moves the meter to her neck, another reading. He moves it down her nude body lit beautifully in the vague light, partially covered with a blanket. 
He scurries across the room, stark naked, with a camera. Price begins photographing her. 
He moves back to her and gently removes the blanket from the rest of her body. His actions are quiet and easy. He stops frequently to admire her. 
Claire lies sleeping nude, except for her socks. Price moves around the room -- picture, picture, picture. 
CLAIRE WAKES UP SLOWLY and pulls the blanket back over her. She opens her eyes and sees Price sitting in a chair several feet away with his camera. 
PRICE G'morning. 
CLAIRE What are you doing? 
PRICE You look beautiful. 
She realizes what he's been doing. 
CLAIRE How long have you been doing this? 
PRICE 'Bout ten frames. Wait'll you see the pictures -- you look great. 
Her sense of violation is balanced by this notion. For a moment we sense her attitude can go either way -- outrage or some sense of being flattered, however ill conceived. She chooses the latter. 
CLAIRE I'll bet I look great -- give me the film. 
PRICE After they're printed. 
CLAIRE I'll develop them myself -- give it to me or I'll start taping what you say in your sleep. 
Price hands her the film and climbs back under the blanket with her. 
PRICE I talk in my sleep? 
CLAIRE Girl's names and F-stops. Terrible. 
They curl up together, holding onto each other. A small child crosses the courtyard, peeking at them. A rooster crows. 
PRICE Call the office. I don't want to go to work today. 
The peacefulness is shaken by the roar of an engine close by. 
A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP PASSES OVER THE COURTYARD They look up, jolted out of the moment. The war is back. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE OUTSKIRTS OF LEON - MORNING 
Price's rental car is a smoking wreck. He and Claire arrive and she removes a single, feeble white flag that remains. They study the car briefly and then turn as: 
A GUARDIA TROOP CARRIER LUMBERS past with a truckload of refugees behind. They wave the flag and catch a ride with the refugees. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FIFTH FLOOR OF INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - DAY 
Alex comes out a door chatting with somebody, and passes a mini-cam crew, old friends. 
ALEX How was Matagalpa? 
MINI-CAM CREW #1 No bang-bang, Alex... none at all. 
ALEX You find anything? 
MINI-CAM CREW #2 Half the press corps. 
A small laugh. They continue on. Alex enters Claire's room. 
INT. CLAIRE'S ROOM 
Alex enters. Nobody there. As he turns to leave he sees some pictures in a stack of papers on her desk. He picks one up. 
CLOSE UP: A PICTURE OF CLAIRE SLEEPING IN LEON It's all over and he knows it. He stares at, even admires, the image. He puts it down and turns to leave as: 
The soldier stops at Tacho's name. Price turns. 
P.O.V. ALEX AND CLAIRE KISSING GOODBYE 
PRICE TURNS AGAIN, embarrassed, faces the soldier. 
PRICE Don't look, huh? (beat) No mire! 
The soldier, confused, turns away, and as he does: 
ALEX SLAPS PRICE ON THE SHOULDER, AND THEY TOO EMBRACE 
ALEX Don't get hurt. 
PRICE Ahh, I'm a chicken, don't worry. (beat) Alex, listen to me... 
ALEX Yeah? 
PRICE Within a year you're gonna be one of the "Ten Most Admired Men in America." 
Alex is amused, Price is serious. The cabbie comes out and Alex heads into the airport. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SOMOZA'S COMPOUND - A PRESS LUNCHEON - DAY 
Daisy and her combo from the Viking Club perform "The Girl From Ipanema" as ONE HUNDRED PRESS MEMBERS and V.I.P.'s sit at long tables in the garden. The pleasantness of the surroundings is countered by the presence of dozens of SOLDIERS in the background, guarding the house, etc. Visible at the head table are: TWO GENERALS AND THEIR WIVES, MRS. SOMOZA, TWO WEALTHY BUSINESSMEN, MISS PANAMA IN A FLOPPY HAT. Elsewhere mingling are: JAZY, ISELA, PRICE, REGIS. An elaborate array of food sits on the table. 
INT. SOMOZA'S HOUSE - DAY 
Overlooking the gathering from his private living room, Somoza grants Claire her interview. He close the window to muffle the singing. 
CLAIRE You're late to your own luncheon, Mr. President -- we can schedule this for another time. 
SOMOZA Nonsense -- let them wait. We are a stunning couple, eh? My stomach is very flat -- I've been working out. 
CLAIRE We are a stunning couple. Mr. President, you own one fifth of all the land in Nicaragua, you own the shipping port, the national airlines, the Mercedes dealership... 
SOMOZA I am on a salt free diet... 
He takes her hand and leads her to two large portraits hanging on a wall -- his parents. 
CLAIRE Do you always hold hands with reporters? 
SOMOZA (ignores her) This is my mother and father. They were very special to me. Every Sunday morning I drive out to the cemetery and put flowers on their grave. I think people should know that. 
CLAIRE Would you care to comment on the fall of Leon to the rebels? 
Somoza just smiles unaffected by her questions; she knows the game is undaunted. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE LUNCHEON TABLES - DAY 
Hub Kittle is bending Price's ear in the crowd. Price seems ammused and watches the anthem contest as he munches food. 
HUB Listen, Russell, let's grow up. It's very easy to fall in love with the underdog, eh? But there's an upside and downside to this thing -- just wanta remind you... this stuff about a "Revolution of Poets" is crap. 
PRICE But it's great P.R. So what's the upside? 
HUB Simple. And it could happen. Somoza destroys the terrorist insurgents, rebuilds the country, shitcans the purveyors of excess, stabilizes the cordoba, and is finally beloved as the savior of Nicaragua. (beat) Our pal. Got a smoke? 
Price gives him a cigaret. 
PRICE What's the downside? 
HUB The Commies take over the world. 
It's simple, and Hub is pleased with his presentation. A SOLDIER moves through the crowd looking quite out of place, finds Hub and hands him a note. Hub reads it, seems delighted, and excuses himself from the table. 
HUB Excuse me, gentlemen, but the war may be over. 
Price and Regis look at each other strangely -- what's he talking about? They shrug, Regis bites into a papaya, and Hub hurries inside. Price and Regis watch the singer. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SECOND FLOOR OF SOMOZA'S HOUSE - DAY 
SOMOZA My people love me. My stomach is flat. Did I say that already? No matter. It is flat. 
CLAIRE There are reports that the Guardia operates a torture chamber at Coyotepe. 
Somoza ignores the question and reopens the window, flooding the room with the Tony Bennett classic. 
SOMOZA I like this song. 
CLAIRE Since the earthquake in 1972 destroyed half of Managua, over three hundred million dollars in foreign relief aid have poured into the country, yet nothing has been re-built. It is said that the money has gone into your pocket. 
SOMOZA I love the press, I really do. Some of my best friends are journalists. 
JAZY What do I know, eh? Tacho needs a victory very badly... he needs to prove to Jimmy Carter that he is still winning. He thinks Rafael's death is the proof he needs. 
PRICE Carter don't need proof. He just sent twenty-five million in new arms to Tacho. (to posers) I'm sorry... almost got it here. 
JAZY No, no... the arms shipment has been delayed in New Orleans because Jimmy is getting nervous. 
PRICE The State Department's gonna pull the plug on Tacho?! Pardon my French -- but whose fucking side are you on? 
Jazy and Price motion for the posers to move a step over. 
JAZY ...I work for everybody. If there is a transition of power, I facilitate a relationship with the new people. If there is not, I facilitate the status quo. (beat) Either way, I facilitate. 
PRICE Great job. 
JAZY I send messages to Jimmy and I tell him that the Revolution is a flood that cannot be stopped but it can be controlled... nobody listens... I can't even get a little water in my pool. 
PRICE Rough ain't it. Thank you everybody, very nice. 
Price smiles to Somoza, Mrs. Somoza, and Miss Panama. Somoza hurries off from his uncomfortable position at last. 
PRICE I don't think Rafael is dead. I'm gonna find him. 
JAZY They say he's very handsome. (beat) It would make a wonderful picture, eh? 
The two men share a smile. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE ROAD TO MATAGLAPA - EARLY MORNING 
A rental station wagon covered with press flags races along. Inside the car are the British crew -- Regis drives -- and Price and Claire. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MATAGALPA - DAY 
A city of about 50,000 located on the side of a hill. The car pulls slowly into the base of the town into a clearing with assorted vehicles -- Red Cross, La Guardia, Press. The car moves slowly as its occupants survey the town, until it pulls alongside a Red Cross truck that has broken down. Price sticks his head out the window to ask instructions of a R.C. WORKER. 
PRICE Con permiso -- who controls what today? 
RED CROSS WORKER (in Spanish) The Sandinistas hold the hills, the Guardia has everything else. 
CLAIRE How do we find the guerillas? 
RED CROSS WORKER (points) Va alli, dos o tres cuartos, doble la esquina al francotirador. 
REGIS What'd he say? 
CLAIRE Go two or three blocks and turn right at the sniper. 
Regis and his crew don't like this at all. Price points. 
P.O.V. A TOWER FULL OF GUARDIA SNIPERS 
PRICE You can drop us off. 
MAIN ROAD INTO MATAGALPA 
A gradual uphill grade -- the press car moves slowly. Guardia are on both sides of the street, as the car stops at the corner, directly beneath the sniper tower. They all look up. 
P.O.V. THE SNIPERS LOOKING BACK DOWN AT THEM 
THE CAR SLOWLY TURNS LEFT 
PRICE Wrong way! 
REGIS We're not looking for the guerillas. 
CLAIRE Then let us out. 
The car stops, the door opens, and: 
A WALL NEARBY IS RIDDLED WITH BULLET HOLES AS THEY CLIMB OUT, so they climb back in quickly. 
P.O.V. A SOLDIER HOLDS OUT HIS ARMS AS IF TO SAY, "accident." 
SOLDIER Lo siento! (I'm sorry!) 
The soldier seems sincere, but they don't want to take a chance. 
PRICE Go one more block. 
THE CAR MOVES DEEPER INTO MATAGALPA, gradually moving among tanquettas patrolling the streets, coming to a barricade which they manuever past as Guardia soldiers look at them strangely. The car turns around -- it has come too far. 
A GUARDIA OFFICER SIGNALS FOR THEM TO GET OUT but the idea doesn't appeal to Regis and he whirls around, panicking slightly, and heads off in the other direction. 
CLAIRE He just wanted to see credentials, for crissakes, what're doing? 
REGIS You want to drive? 
THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS TOTALLY SANDINISTA and several guerillas are at the door. The boy speaks to one of the guards, and they are admitted. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE HOUSE - DAY 
THEY ARE SEARCHED IMMEDIATELY, asked to put down their gear, asked for credentials, and led down the hallway of a house that is very American middle class. 
ANOTHER SOLDIER WITH RIFLE detains them momentarily before showing them into a room used as a Revolutionary Command office. 
ISELA STANDS IN MILITARY FATIGUES talking to her Sandinista colleagues. Clearly she commands respect and makes decisions. She finishes and turns to Claire and Price in a very businesslike way, never acknowledging directly that they have met before. 
ISELA You are looking for Rafael? 
They are somewhat taken aback at her directness and information. 
PRICE Yeah. If it's possible. 
CLAIRE Do you know why we're here... exactly? 
ISELA Mr. Price doesn't do anything before announcing it first in the bar. (beat) It's a good story. You'll be more famous. 
EXT. A MOUNTAIN ROAD - LATER - DAY 
An old truck chugs up a series of cutbacks through rough terrain. The truck has no hood, and a BOY sits on the fender pouring oil from a series of Folgers cans into a funnel stuck permanently into the engine. Underneath, dangling cans catch the oil as it flows through. Price, Claire and FOUR ARMED SANDINISTAS sit in the back. ISELA rides in front. 
THE TRUCK PASSES THROUGH A FRIENDLY GUERILLA ROADBLOCK 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TOBACCO FIELDS IN REMOTE TERRAIN - DAY 
ISELA, CLAIRE, PRICE AND THE FOUR HIKE into increasingly inaccessible terrain. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RAFAEL'S CAMP - DUSK 
Heavily guarded but very mobile, the camp consists of perhaps 100 Soldiers, women preparing food, several tents. Price and Claire attract attention as they enter. 
PRICE STOPS AND LOOKS AROUND THE CAMP CLOSELY seeming to take it all in. He's been in many similar camps, countries, wars. 
P.O.V. TWO SOLDIERS GUARDING THE ENTRANCE TO ONE TENT 
CLAIRE Rafael's tent? 
Price doesn't answer but continues taking it all in, and ISELA shouts to them to continue. 
ISELA Venga, companeros. (Come, comrades.) 
THEY CONTINUE INTO THE CAMP, BUT PRICE STOPS AGAIN Something has caught him, his sixth sense, a feeling -- he refuses to walk further for the moment. No glibness, just coolness. 
CLAIRE What is it? 
Price looks around, speaks quietly. 
PRICE Rafael is dead. 
Claire looks around quickly. There is no evidence to her. 
PRICE I can smell it. 
CLAIRE I don't know. 
ISELA (slightly exasperated) Venga por favor! Alli! 
They continue into the camp -- now Claire looks around nervously. Price mutters a half laugh, softly and strangely, as they are led to a makeshift table and offered food. In the b.g. Isela enters one of the tents. 
PRICE AND CLAIRE SIT DOWN TO EAT and Price continues scanning the camp as they talk. 
CLAIRE What're you talking about? 
PRICE He's dead. I know it. 
CLAIRE Then why did they bring us all the way here to see him? 
He doesn't know. 
P.O.V. FOUR FIGURES/CONFERRING IN FRONT OF A TENT Isela emerges and joins them. The others are: THE PRIEST FROM LEON, A BUSINESSMAN WHOM WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE FROM EARLIER SCENES, AND COMMANDANTE CINCO, dressed in camouflaged khaki. 
ISELA WALKS OVER TO CLAIRE AND PRICE after talking with the others. She brings COMMANDANTE CINCO with her. They sit down. 
ISELA This is Commandante Cinco. 
They all shake hands. 
Isela begins at once. 
ISELA Today we took Matagalpa. Leon is about to fall, and Masaya. And next week we could be in Managua but it is still possible to lose. (beat) In the last days of our final offensive the people of Nicaragua must know that Rafael is alive and well. 
PRICE Don't think so much. 
He gets on the cot with her. They kiss deeply, passionately, and begin making love. 
EXT. THE CAMP - FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN 
THE CAMP IS COMING TO LIFE as the flap opens on Price's tent and he looks out. He raises his camera and starts taking pictures of: 
A WOMAN COOKING OVER A FIRE AS A BUSINESSMAN LOOKS ON, a face we recognize from earlier in Managua -- FREEZE FRAME 
THREE YOUNG GUERRILLAS PLAYING WITH A DOG -- FREEZE FRAME 
THE PRIEST FROM LEON DRINKING FROM A GOURD -- FREEZE FRAME 
TWO CHILDREN PLAYING WITH HANDMADE TOYS -- FREEZE FRAME 
ISELA COMING OUT OF ANOTHER TENT -- FREEZE FRAME 
PRICE RISES AND LOOKS AROUND THE CAMP, wandering over to a large can where he drinks some water. 
CLAIRE EMERGES FROM THE TENT and watches Price head over to a shaded area with his cameras. 
CLAIRE'S P.O.V. OF PRICE AS HE MOVES THROUGH A GROUP OF SANDINISTAS GATHERED AROUND A TABLE 
Their backs are toward us as he adjusts seating positions and rearranges items that have been provided for the table. 
He takes a light reading and moves quickly into position. Price raises his camera. 
CUT TO: 
PRICE'S P.O.V. OF A TABLEAU OF RAFAEL, CINCO, AND SOLDIERS They sit at a table studying a map, a copy of La Prensa is displayed -- the headlines declare that RAFAEL IS DEAD and featuring a photo of Somoza at the luncheon as he points to a map of the country. For an instant Rafael looks alive -- FREEZE FRAME. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE ROAD BLOCK TO MANAGUA - LATER 
Price and Claire are sitting on top of a Red Cross truck as it heads through Sebaco. Soldiers from La Guardia are everywhere. As the truck moves through the village, something catches Price's eyes: 
OATES STANDS AGAINST A WALL IN COMMAND OF A SQUADRON Two whores and several troops sit against a wall. As the truck passes, Oates waves casually, with emotion. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. PRICE'S HOTEL BATHROOM IN MANAGUA - DAY 
Red light in the bathroom as Price pulls several photo prints from the bath and plasters them wet against the mirror. 
PHOTO OF RAFAEL IN THE CAMP, and he looks very much alive. He pulls more shots from the bath: THE PRIEST FROM LEON, THE BUSINESSMAN, COMMANDANTE CINCO AND ISELA. He dries them off and hides them with their negatives under a pile of equipment. 
He picks up the shot of Rafael and leaves. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SOMEWHERE IN MANAGUA 
A group of muchachos in masks, baseball caps, and bandanas race through the streets carrying a photo blow-up of Rafael. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JAZY'S HOUSE 
The newspaper headline sits on Jazy's desk as Jazy studies it unemotionally. We hear Miss Panama's voice: 
MISS PANAMA Marcel! 
He spins on his chair as she glides in modeling a new dress. She spins magically for him -- he blows her a kiss. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LUSH RIVER VALLEY OF NICARAGUA - DAY 
A small private plane flies through a canyon, dwarfed by the spectacular landscape. Hub Kittle works the room. 
INT. THE PLANE - DAY 
Two MASKED GUERILLAS hold a gun to the head of a pilot. A large sack is crammed into the tiny compartment with them. 
EXT. A SMALL MOUNTAIN TOWN IN NICARAGUA - DAY 
The plane flies in low over the town and suddenly: 
THE SKY IS FILLED WITH LEAFLETS that flutter to the ground. Townspeople, bewildered at first, pick up the papers to see: 
CLOSE UP -- PRICE'S PHOTOGRAPH OF RAFAEL ALIVE 
LOCAL RESIDENTS RAISE THEIR FISTS IN SALUTE to the plane as it disappears into the mountains. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE ROOFTOP GARDEN OF THE INTERCONTINENTAL - DAY 
PRICE We don't owe him anything! 
CLAIRE We owe him that! (beat) He got you started in this business... he covered for your missed deadlines and made excuses for your unprofessional attitude before the world fell in love with your pictures... (beat) Before kids fresh out of journalism school were rushing off to any war they could to interview bullets and take pictures of bodies -- like Price! (beat) He took care of you before you were hot! 
Silence. She's hitting home but he doesn't want to acknowledge it. 
PRICE He wouldn't understand. 
CLAIRE Before Nicaragua you wouldn't understand. I'm not sure I exactly understand. (beat) What are we going to do? 
There is something calculating in Price's tone, this is not the fearless, boyish innocent anymore. 
PRICE I'll take Alex to find Rafael -- we'll go to Sebaco on the road to Matagalpa -- the Guardia heavily control the area and they're scared right now -- they'll never let us through. We won't be able to get near Rafael. Alex will understand -- and we'll turn around and drive back without a story. 
Claire is disturbed at this compounding of the lie. 
CLAIRE That's a lie! 
PRICE Tell me about lies! 
Silence. They are co-conspirators and they know it. 
CLAIRE I don't want to tell him either. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ROAD TO MATAGALPA - NEXT DAY 
Price's white flagged newly rented press car streaks along, overtaking an ox cart. A guardia convoy is going the opposite direction, back toward Managua. Alex looks out of the car with interest--he hasn't been to the front line for several wars. 
PRICE We may not be able to find him, y'know... 
ALEX I've got supreme confidence in you. 
A car is on fire by the side of the road. Price flies past; Alex watches curiously. Several people stand around the car. 
ALEX Claire looks good, eh? 
PRICE Everybody looks good in the tropics. 
Alex isn't sure how to respond to this curious reply. 
ALEX Since I haven't been able to find Isela since coming back, you're going to have to translate for me -- what the hell does that mean? 
Price is nervous, wired, on edge. 
PRICE Alex... I love her. 
Alex takes this calmly -- it's not exactly new information. 
ALEX And she 'thinks' she loves you. 
PRICE It's past the thinking stage. 
Alex looks at the passing scenery -- he's in no hurry. 
ALEX I'd like to know something -- it probably doesn't matter in the great final scheme of things... but I'm interested... (beat) Did you ever lay a hand on her before she left me? 
PRICE No! 
ALEX That's the truth? 
PRICE Yes! (beat) Alex -- we're friends! 
There is something desperate in his voice. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. A ROADBLOCK ON THE EDGE OF SEBACO - DAY 
Price and Alex are ordered out of their car by a very unfriendly Guardia soldier. He is ordered to put down his camera bag. The hood and trunk are opened. 
SOLDIER Venga. 
They are led to a shed by the roadside, A TIRE REPAIR SHOP, where they sit down in an oily, dusty shack. They watch the soldiers: 
P.O.V. THE SOLDIERS TEARING UP THE RENTAL CAR, pulling off door panels, looking for weapons. 
ALEX I bet you go through a few rental cars. 
PRICE Don't worry. I put this in your name. 
PRICE AND ALEX JERK TO LIFE at the sound of screaming in the distance. A volley of gunfire follows. Price moves quickly into an adjoining shed and looks through a crack in the wall: 
P.O.V. AN EXECUTION SQUAD IN A FIELD as several bodies are being hauled away. Two soldiers reload their guns. PAN to a figure moving behind a wall -- OATES. 
PRICE HURRIES THROUGH THE SHACKS TOWARD THE EXECUTION WALL as Alex calls to him and hurries after -- Price is single- minded. As he moves through the shacks we hear another volley of fire, and Price bursts into a clearing to see: 
TWO TRUCKS BEING LOADED WITH BODIES AS OATES SUPERVISES. PRICE STEPS INTO THE CLEARING -- FACE-TO-FACE WITH OATES. 
PRICE Alex... I think I finally saw one too many bodies. (beat) Somoza is a killer. (beat) I thought the war would end sooner. (beat) How many reasons do you want? 
ALEX You saw too many bodies? That's a lot of bodies. (beat; to Price) You stupid son of a bitch. (to Claire) Did he talk you into it? 
CLAIRE No! I wanted Rafael to be alive. 
ALEX In some way I understand him doing it, I don't like it but I understand... but you? 
CLAIRE I'd do it again. 
Alex lets it all sink in. These two people about whom he has such passionate feelings have totally exposed themselves to him. 
ALEX You two have, of course, just served me up your balls -- if that's what they're called -- on a platter. (several beats) I can bury you both. You're handing me your careers. 
They don't respond -- he's right. 
ALEX Well, Jesus Christ... this is a motherfucking story, Russell... (long silence) What am I supposed to do with it? 
CLAIRE Anything you want. 
Small, tired gallows laughter from Alex. There is a long silence before Alex speaks, aware of the irony. 
ALEX They're holding the lead in the World section for Rafael. 
PRICE It's great stuff, isn't it? We'd go down in a blaze of glory. 
ALEX Oh yeah... (distraught) I don't know what to do. (beat) I've gotta take some kind of a story back with me. Maybe Jazy, eh? 
CLAIRE Oh Jesus. 
PRICE It's a little dangerous looking for Jazy at the moment. 
ALEX (mock heroic) Ah, danger -- I love it. You could ask the pointy-shoed little bastard about your pictures... and I could ask him whatever happened to Isela. 
CLAIRE She's an officer in the Rafael army -- we saw her in Matagalpa. 
Alex is surprised slightly, but takes pleasure in revealing it. 
ALEX You mean I slept with a Sandinista? 
Price and Claire exchange glances. Alex is dead serious. 
ALEX I guess Rafael is alive, eh? 
CUT TO: 
INT. CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
PRICE AND CLAIRE LIE IN BED sweating. A siren and distant mortar can be heard outside. Price goes to the window and shuts it -- the room is quieter and hotter. He pounds a broken air conditioning duct. 
PRICE Damn air conditioning. 
He looks out the window -- it never used to be this complicated. 
CLAIRE I wish I was home. 
Silence. 
PRICE C'mere. 
She goes to him, lies down, and they embrace. 
CLAIRE Do you think it's almost over? 
A loud, long burst of automatic weapons fire is heard somewhere outside. Their eyes are open as they hold onto each other. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE STREETS OF MANAGUA - NEXT MORNING 
A sense of foreboding. Heavy road equipment prowls the street looking for Rebel barricades to destroy. Tanquettas and Guardia everywhere. 
The flag draped press car of Price and Alex drives slowly. 
P.O.V. OUT OF THE CAR AS THEY LOOK CAREFULLY Things feel wrong. Guardia barricades are everywhere, forcing them to follow a route they might not choose. The Guardia soldiers at the barricades seem on edge. When Jazy's house is visible in the distance, barricades force them another direction. 
GUARDIA SOLDIERS RACE DOWN A STREET TOWARD GUNFIRE and the car stops. When the road is clear it creeps into an intersection. They check their position. 
THE CAR CREEPS TO A STOP and they look around further. 
A PIG CROSSES THE STREET 100 YARDS AWAY AND IS SHOT BY A SOLDIER. 
Everything is wrong. Price looks around restlessly. 
PRICE Alex... let's go back. 
ALEX Jazy's probably sitting in the bar laughing at us. Which way's the hotel? 
PRICE I don't know. 
Journalists are everywhere -- suitcases packed -- trying to get out of the country. The registration desk is chaos. Regis tries to get the attention of the clerk -- so does everyone else. 
REGIS Get my bill and get me a cab, hey, amigo! 
The clerk is under attack. 
CLERK No cabs. 
REGIS Cabs! 
CLERK No cabs! 
CLAIRE GETS OFF THE ELEVATOR AND MOVES THROUGH THIS CHAOS Regis sees her and tries to give her comfort -- she's beyond that. She wears a jacket and carries her bag -- she's going somewhere. 
REGIS I'm sorry, Claire... 
She pushes him away politely; she is single-minded now. 
CLAIRE Heard from Russell? 
REGIS Nobody has. 
CLAIRE Wanta help me find him? 
Regis looks at her like she's crazy. 
REGIS Claire... it's on the weird side out there... 
Hub Kittle enters the lobby, sees Claire and volunteers: 
HUB Jesus Christ, Claire, a human tragedy, what can I say? 
Claire is nearly in tears, but resists. 
CLAIRE Fuck off, Hub, get outta my way. 
CLAIRE EXITS THE HOTEL AND GETS INTO HER PRESS CAR 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREETS OF MANAGUA - LONG SHOT OF JAZY'S HOUSE - DAY 
Claire stays in her car and watches the house -- no way to get close -- and she continues driving, her route dictated by the same barricades that directed Alex and Price. 
She passes the dead pig in the street, and TWO RED CROSS WORKERS make their way slowly around a corner, frightened. Claire gets out of her car and approaches them. 
CLAIRE (in Spanish) Do you know where the American journalist was killed? 
They all point down a street. She shows them the polaroid of Price and her. 
CLAIRE (in Spanish) Have you seen him? 
They haven't and continue on their way. Claire walks in the direction they pointed -- no street fighting but many Guardia. 
P.O.V. PRICE'S CAR FAR DOWN THE STREET SURROUNDED BY GUARDIA 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SHANTYTOWN - DAY 
PRICE HUNCHES DOWN AND CRAWLS BEHIND THE STALLS as soldiers move through the yards looking for him. 
A WOMAN IN A DOORWAY WATCHES PRICE HIDE 
THE WOMAN APPEARS IN A DOORWAY AND MOTIONS WITH HER HEAD for Price to dart inside. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE HOUSE - DAY 
Nothing is said. Price is led into a room, one of many -- but this room is boarded over. There is no escape. Price is in pain, his arm bleeds, he's tiring. 
WOMAN (in Spanish) This is the best I can offer. 
PRICE Gracias. 
PRICE STANDS IN THE TINY ROOM WAITING 
He leans against the wall behind the door. He shuts his eyes -- a noise at the door. When he opens them: 
THE WOMAN IS STANDING THERE WITH A GUN 
She hands it to him and leaves, bolting the door. 
PRICE LEANS AGAINST THE WALL HOLDING A REVOLVER and he waits -- cameras around his neck, gun in hand, bloody, slightly ridiculous, and scared. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE STREETS OF MANAGUA - DAY 
Price and Claire continue on down the street and simultaneously noticed something strange: 
THE DOOR TO JAZY'S HOUSE IS WIDE OPEN They approach carefully and look in a view to the court-yard. Claire sticks her head in the door slowly, and as she does: 
A GIANT HAND GUN IS STUCK IN HER TEMPLE as TWO MUCHACHOS quickly seize her and Price, dragging them inside. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JAZY'S COURTYARD - LATE IN DAY 
JAZY STANDS WITH A THIRD GUN AT HIS HEAD, being held by the most forceful and crazed of three young Muchachos. With guns on Jazy, Price, and Claire, there is much confusion as to who's in charge and what exactly they're doing. 
MUCHACHO #1 (in Spanish) Who are you? 
JAZY They are my friends. 
MUCHACHO #2 (in Spanish) Shut up. We kill them all. 
MUCHACHO #3 (in Spanish) No. Only him. 
The guns are aimed back and forth in confusion -- Price and Claire don't have a chance to respond, and they're not sure what to say. 
MUCHACHO #1 (in Spanish) Him or him or her? 
The Muchachos begin arguing rapidly among themselves; and as they do, Jazy addresses Price and Claire coolly. 
JAZY Well, here we are, eh? 
MUCHACHO #1 (in Spanish) Assassin! Shut up! 
JAZY The boys are confused -- they think I had their family killed. 
PRICE You murder people. 
JAZY "Murder" is a word for criminals. I have a job to protect the stability of a continent. 
MUCHACHO #3 Pig! Hijo de puta! 
JAZY Please... 
He is not begging for his life as much as for them to calm down. 
CLAIRE You got caught by some boys? 
JAZY Yes. Poets too, I imagine. (beat) Is your recorder on? 
CLAIRE (hesitates) Yes. 
JAZY Good. I have a speech to make. 
The Muchachos don't understand what he's saying, but they stop to listen to his style. The guns remained trained on all three. 
JAZY I like you people, but you are sentimental shits. You fall in love with the poets, the poets fall in love with the Marxists, the Marxists fall in love with themselves. The country is destroyed with rhetoric, and in the end we are stuck with tyrants. 
MUCHACHO #1 (in Spanish) Shut up! 
Jazy turns to the boy who jams the gun into his head and speaks with tired authority. 
JAZY Un minuto, por favor. 
MUCHACHO #2 (to Price and Claire, more calmly) Who are you? 
JAZY (in Spanish) They are journalists. 
The Muchachos are immediately surprised and delighted, and one of them speaks in excited, broken English. 
MUCHACHO #1 Periodistas! Take this picture! I'm going to blow his head off. 
The Muchachos quickly withdraw their guns from Price and Claire and aim them all at Jazy's head. 
JAZY Somoza? He is a tyrant too, of course. A butcher. (beat) But finally that is not the point, you see. If we wish to survive -- we have a choice of tyrants, and for all the right reasons, your poets choose the wrong side. 
MUCHACHO #1 (impatiently) Fotografia! 
PRICE No. 
JAZY Yes. (beat) Your picture of Rafael was brilliant... but I am alive, and better looking. A good looking Frenchman with a sympathetic face is murdered in cold blood while fighting for the survival of Europe and America. (beat) You will have another magazine cover! (smiles) Muy complicado, no? 
MUCHACHO #1 (in Spanish) Ready! Now! 
CLAIRE You picked the wrong side. 
JAZY In fifty years we will know who's right. (beat) Are you going to take the picture as the bullet enters the skull or as it comes out? This wall's a nice color, eh? I can move into the sunlight. 
CLAIRE TURNS AND WALKS AWAY, her back to the scene. 
JAZY (to Claire) It's just a story! 
PRICE REMAINS AND STARES AT JAZY as the Muchachos grow increasingly impatient. Some part of him wants to take the picture. 
CLAIRE SHOWS A PICTURE OF PRICE AND HER to a woman who comes out of the house next to Jazy's, but the woman shakes her head, not recognizing Price. 
A PUSH-PULL PLANE DIVES IN LOW FIRING ROCKETS at the homes. 
THE CROWD GROWS and chaotically flees the destruction, gradually finding a direction out of the city. Claire is swept along in the crowds, at first without choice, then finally fleeing for her life with the rest of Managua. As she moves with the crowd, she looks for Price everywhere, without success. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. A TEMPORARY REFUGEE CAMP - NIGHT 
SEVERAL CAMPFIRES burn near the edge of the city where dozens have taken temporary refuge. Claire arrives to see: A BODY ON A STRETCHER BEING CARRIED up outside stairs to a rooftop from which glow several bare bulbs. She goes up the stairs to the rooftop. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. A ROOFTOP HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
A MAKESHIFT MOBILE HOSPITAL under awnings and palm fronds, capable of moving location in minutes. A WOMAN DOCTOR and two temporary orderlies tend to wounded. A small black and white television sits on a table and those who are able watch the seige of Managua on television while it goes on around them. Claire looks for Price among the dead or wounded. 
P.O.V. -- THE CITY UNDER ATTACK 
Claire watches for several moments -- smoke, flame, the buzzing sound of planes swooping low, fleeing crowds. She then notices the television. 
PRICE'S FOOTAGE OF ALEX'S DEATH comes on the TV screen, and she pushes closer to see the grim sequence. The NEWS COMMENTATOR explains in Spanish what we see CLAIRE IS SO DISTURBED AT THE IMAGES that she turns away, sickened, hurt, guilty, outraged, but unable to break down. She closes her eyes -- her face is covered with tears. The Doctor notices this and speaks softly to her. 
DOCTOR Journalist? (Claire nods) You knew the man who was killed? (she nods again) Fifty thousand Nicaraguans have died... and now one Yankee. (beat) Perhaps now Americans will be outraged at what is happening here, eh? 
It takes a while for Claire to respond. 
CLAIRE Yes... perhaps they will. 
Noise in the distance from mortars. The Doctor speaks calmly, without bitterness in the voice, but with total conviction. 
DOCTOR Maybe we should have killed an American journalist fifty years ago. 
Claire acknowledges the grim truth of the observation with a slight nod, and walks to the railing as: 
ALEX'S DEATH IS REPEATED IN FREEZE FRAME SEQUENCE over and over again as the Orderlies, Doctor, and patients gather to watch with fascination. 
CLAIRE STARES OUT AT THE CITY ON FIRE, when her eye catches something -- a light in the sky. She watches: 
P.O.V. -- A HELICOPTER WITH SEARCHLIGHT PASSES OVERHEAD, momentarily illuminating the hospital, but it continues on, curiously uninterested in the Guerrilla activity. The chopper sweeps above a nearby hill and hovers, then slowly lowers to earth. 
CLAIRE WATCHES with interest then descends the stairs. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE CEMETERY - NIGHT 
SOMOZA WATCHES AS A BACK HOE DIGS UP THE COFFINS of his parents. An Army helicopter lands, lighting the scene, and Miss Panama rushes from the chopper into his arms as the turbulence from the blades raises her dress and musses his hair. Soldiers place the dirt-covered caskets on the roofs of Somoza's two Mercedes, hastily tie them down, and the strange motorcade, flanked by two heavily armed jeeps, drives off into the dark. 
CLAIRE WATCHES IT ALL from a safe distance, not far from the refugee camp. She turns and walks slowly back to the camp. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE REFUGEE CAMP - LATE AT NIGHT 
Claire sits down against the remains of a wall. The war has overtaken her -- she doesn't know if Price is alive -- and though totally involved, she is at last an observer once again. Claire notices the tiny red light of her recorder is still on. She turns it off, and as the sounds of battle gradually die down, Claire falls asleep -- exhausted. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. THE REFUGEE CAMP - DAWN 
CLAIRE SLEEPS AGAINST THE WALL as a dog sniffs and licks her face. She awakens with a start -- the dog scurries away. Claire rises and looks around. 
A LOCAL WOMAN PUSHES A CART carrying the wrapped body of her husband through the otherwise quiet streets of Managua. 
CLAIRE MOVES THROUGH THE CAMP just coming to life, and looks around trying to interpret the eerie silence. A WOMAN tends to her TWO SMALL CHILDREN. 
CLAIRE (in Spanish) Have you seen La Guardia? 
WOMAN WITH CHILDREN (in Spanish) No. Is the war over? 
CLAIRE (in Spanish) I don't know. 
A DISTANT, DRONING NOISE GETS STEADILY LOUDER. Claire looks around nervously. 
A CHILD RUNS DOWN THE STREET SHOUTING 
CHILD Tanquettas! Tanquettas! 
P.O.V. -- SEVERAL TANQUETTAS AND EARTH MOVERS coming over the hill in the distance. The Refugees look up fearfully and some hide. As the war machinery gets closer, we see that: 
SANDINISTAS ARE DRIVING THE MACHINES draped with red and black (F.S.L.N.), blue and white (Nicaraguan), and yellow and white (the Vatican) flags. Graffiti of victory covers the tanquettas. 
PEOPLE COME INTO THE STREET CHEERING, embracing, only gradually realizing what has happened. 
WOMAN WITH CHILDREN (in Spanish) Is the war over? 
CLAIRE Yes.

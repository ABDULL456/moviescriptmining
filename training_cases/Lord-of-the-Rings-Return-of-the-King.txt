DENETHOR (softly) You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me. 
CLOSE ON: GANDALF looks shocked, DENETHOR'S eyes NARROW. 
DENETHOR (cont'd) (contemptuous) I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the North - last of a ragged house, long bereft of Lordship. 
GANDALF (stung) Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King - Steward!

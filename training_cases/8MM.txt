INT.  MIAMI AIRPORT, TERMINAL -- DAY 
Amongst the weary tourist families and solitary businessmen sits TOM WELLES, middle-aged, hair neat, suit crisp and gray.  He's eating crackers from a cellophane package, sipping soda from a paper cup, watching an ARRIVAL GATE. 
AT THE GATE 
PASSENGERS arrive: the paunchy, graying men of First Class leading the pack, except for a handsome YOUNG REPUBLICAN poster boy hurrying along. 
ACROSS THE TERMINAL 
Welles gets up and FOLLOWS... 
EXT.  MIAMI AIRPORT, CURBSIDE -- DAY 
Welles comes outside, squinting in the sun, moving down the sidewalk, looking back over his shoulder... 
The Young Republican is lead to a waiting LIMO by a DRIVER. 
Welles moves to the nearby TAXI STAND... 
INT.  TAXI -- DAY 
Welles gets in, turning in his seat to watch behind. 
CAB DRIVER Where to? 
Welles keeps watching, sees the limo pull away and pass. 
WELLES Follow that limousine.  Don't get too close, don't let it get too far away.  Just keep with it. 
CAB DRIVER You kidding? 
WELLES Nope. 
The cab set in motion.  Welles takes out cigarettes, lighting one, takes out a small NOTEPAD and makes notations. 
CAB DRIVER Uh, listen... you're not supposed to be smoking in here.  I'm sorry, that's company policy... 
WELLES How about this... every cigarette I smoke, I give you five dollars? 
CAB DRIVER Okay... okay, yeah, that'd be good... 
EXT.  MIAMI BEACH, "GOLD COAST" -- DAY 
In front of an Art Deco hotel, the driver opens the limousine door and the Young Republican steps out. 
ACROSS THE STREET 
Welles watches from inside the double-parked taxicab. 
EXT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE -- DAY 
Not exactly four-star.  "AD LT MOVIES EVERY ROOM." 
INT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE -- DAY 
Welles is asleep on the bed, full dressed, hands folded across his stomach, snoring lightly, sweaty. 
INT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE, RESTAURANT -- DAY 
Welles sits alone at the bar, eating a sandwich, bored.  He watches some fuzzy ESPN on the t.v., looks at his watch. 
EXT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE -- DAY 
Welles walks across the parking lot, gets into his RENTAL CAR, starts it and drives away. 
EXT.  MIAMI BEACH DISCOTHEQUE -- NIGHT 
Young Republican and a GAUDY WOMAN exit the disco, MUSIC THROBBING out from the doors behind them.  They join hands, drunk, heading to the street, looking for their limo. 
DOWN THE STREET 
Welles is seated in his parked rental car, raises a CAMERA with TELEPHOTO LENS: whir, CLICK, whir, CLICK, whir, CLICK... Welles lowers the camera, letting out a yawn. 
INT.  AIRPLANE, COACH -- NIGHT 
The familiar DRONE of flight.  Welles is shoehorned into his aisle seat, using tiny utensils to eat his tiny meal. 
An OLDER WOMAN arrives in the aisle.  Welles picks up his tray, closes his tray table, unbuckling his seatbelt, struggling to get up... finally successful, balancing his tray, letting the woman in to the window seat. 
OLDER WOMAN Thank you. 
Welles nods, forcing a smile, sitting back down.  He returns to toiling over his miniature supper. 
EXT.  HARRISBURG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT 
Welles' AIRPLANE ROARS down with a SCREECH, landing lights gleaming.  The airport is small, relatively isolated. 
TITLE:      Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 
INT.  HARRISBURG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT 
Passengers arrive.  Welles is with them, searching the few PEOPLE waiting in the terminal hallway.  Welles smiles... 
Welles' wife, AMY, smiles when she sees him.  She's plain and pretty, holding one hand on a BABY STROLLER beside her. Welles comes to her, embracing her, appreciating her. 
AMY Welcome home. 
Down the lane, PINS SCATTER.  One pin remains standing. 
Welles balls up his fists and curses, walks back towards his rowdy, mocking teammates.  He shouts back at them, laughing, grabbing his beer and drinking, waiting at the ball return. 
INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT 
Dinner.  Welles and Amy eat at the kitchen table with Cindy in a high chair.  Amy feeds Cindy between bites.  Welles is still in his league shirt. 
AMY You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend? 
WELLES Sure.  I'll call the guy. 
AMY You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it? 
WELLES I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless. (eating) You have bridge here Saturday? 
AMY Betty's out of town so we're playing next week. 
Welles nods, eating.  He watches Amy feed Cindy.  The PHONE starts RINGING.  Welles goes to answer it. 
WELLES (into PHONE) Hello.  Yes... could you hold on a minute...? 
Welles hands the phone to Amy, pats Cindy's head as he heads downstairs, through the LIVING ROOM... 
INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT 
Welles enters his well kept OFFICE, turns on a light at the desk.  The room is filled with FILE CABINETS and shelves of BOOKS, hundreds of PHONE BOOKS and a COPY MACHINE.  Welles picks up the phone and cups the receiver. 
WELLES (shouts upstairs) Okay, I've got it. (into phone) Hello... sorry, I was switching phones.  It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mrs. Christian. (listens) Yes.  Yes, I understand... tomorrow evening should be fine... 
Welles listens, clears space on his desk, taking notes. 
EXT.  CHRISTIAN COMPOUND -- DUSK 
A huge OLD WORLD MANSION is situated at the center of acres of Pennsylvania forest and vast gardens.  Welles' car heads down a long tree lined drive, to the dark mansion. 
INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT 
Welles follows a BUTLER down a long hall. 
INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, LIBRARY -- NIGHT 
The butler shows Welles in, shuts the door. Towering SHELVES of BOOKS are serviced by ladders.  Far across the room, an old, sad woman, MRS. CHRISTIAN, sits waiting with a tall, thin, sinister ghoul of a LAWYER. 
MRS CHRISTIAN Mister Welles. You're very prompt. 
WELLES I try to be. 
Welles crosses towards them. It takes a while. 
MRS CHRISTIAN I appreciate your coming on such short notice. 
Mrs. Christian holds out her hand and Welles takes it. 
MRS CHRISTIAN This is Mister Longdale, my late husband's attorney. 
Welles shakes Longdale's limp hand, looking him over. 
WELLES Uh huh, pleasure. 
MRS CHRISTIAN Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak. 
LONGDALE Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you. 
WELLES I'm listening. 
LONGDALE As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend. 
WELLES Of what sort? 
LONGDALE You are a private investigator? 
WELLES That's right. 
LONGDALE Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval. 
MRS CHRISTIAN Yes, how theatrical.  So you've gone on the record, and now perhaps you should just be gone. 
Longdale's irritated, but has no choice.  He walks away. 
MRS CHRISTIAN Have a pleasant evening. (to Welles) Will you have tea, Mister Welles? 
WELLES Thank you. 
Mrs. Christian begins pouring tea from the service on a table.  Welles watches Longdale exit. 
WELLES He's odd. 
MRS CHRISTIAN He's a lawyer. (offers tea) Please, sit, here... 
Welles accepts a dainty tea cup and saucer, taking a seat. 
MRS CHRISTIAN I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places. 
WELLES I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire. 
MRS CHRISTIAN You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality. 
Welles nods, sipping tea. 
MRS CHRISTIAN As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now. 
WELLES My condolences. 
MRS CHRISTIAN His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma. 
WELLES You... you need to go to the police. 
MRS CHRISTIAN I told you I can't, not yet. 
WELLES You don't have any other choice. 
MRS CHRISTIAN (stands, shakes her head) No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first... 
WELLES It won't work like that. 
MRS CHRISTIAN Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her. 
Welles sits, rests his head in his hands. 
WELLES I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations... 
MRS CHRISTIAN You've found missing persons before. 
WELLES Nothing remotely like this. 
MRS CHRISTIAN I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it. (pause) I feel responsible, Mr. Welles. (pause) You saw what he did to her. 
Welles stands, torn apart and uncertain, looks back to the dining room where the projector sits idle. 
INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BABY'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
Cindy is sound asleep in her crib. Welles is seated near, staring at his sleeping child. 
INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
Welles digs in piles of SHOEBOXES and BOOKS on the floor of his cluttered closet, finds what he wants: a LOCK BOX. 
INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT 
Welles twists the lock box dial's combination, opens the box to reveal his GUN, HOLSTER and CLEANING SUPPLIES.  Welles takes out the gun, cleaning it.  Amy watches. 
WELLES This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money. 
AMY I understand. 
WELLES Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way. 
AMY I know. 
WELLES It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation. 
AMY Why the gun? 
WELLES I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution. (cleaning gun) Don't worry about me. 
INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT 
Welles looks through one file cabinet.  He pulls out a FILE. It contains all sorts of POLICE ARTIST SKETCHES.  Welles finds one of a TEENAGE GIRL with dark hair, looks at it. 
Welles positions the sketch on his COPY MACHINE, hits copy. 
EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE, DRIVEWAY -- MORNING 
Welles loads BOXES and a SUITCASE into his car's back seat. 
Welles puts the lock box in the car's trunk, in a hiding place beside the spare tire.  He places a brown BRIEFCASE on top, covers them both with carpet.  He closes the trunk. 
EXT.  PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE -- MORNING 
Little traffic.  Welles' Ford races down the highway. 
EXT.  CLEVELAND CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY 
City skyline, overcast.  Looks like rain. 
TITLE:       Cleveland, Ohio 
EXT.  CLEVELAND STREETS -- DAY 
Welles' car moves slowly in a not-so-great neighborhood. Welles leans forward, peering through the windshield... 
An APARTMENT BUILDING'S crooked SIGN lists "WEEKLY RATES." 
INT.  WELLES' ROOM, CLEVELAND -- DAY 
Dingy room.  Welles locks the door, puts the chain on. His suitcase and boxes are on the bed.  He begins unpacking, taking a PHOTO ENLARGER from one box and an 8MM PROJECTOR. 
INT.  WELLES' ROOM, BATHROOM -- DAY 
The developer's on the toilet.  DEVELOPING PANS are on the floor, developer bath, stop bath and fixing bath, with BOTTLES of CHEMICALS and packages of PHOTO PAPER.  Welles uses tape and ALUMINUM FOIL to black-out a window. 
INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- DAY 
Pizza box on the bedside table.  Welles' suits hang in the closet.  Welles sits facing a small REEL TO REEL on a desk. He wears white gloves, handles the 8MM FILM, careful to hold it by the edges, holding it up to the light, squinting. 
Welles puts in a magnifying EYEPIECE, leaning close... 
WELLES' P.O.V. THROUGH MAGNIFYING LENS: studying the first few inches of exposed film, coming upon TINY LETTERS printed just below the sprocket holes: "SUPRAlux 544." 
INT.  WELLES' ROOM, BATHROOM -- DAY 
RED BULB in the light socket.  Welles threads the 8MM FILM into his enlarger, still in white gloves. 
He flicks the enlarger on, projecting a sideways IMAGE down onto the enlarger's baseboard, FOCUSING... it's the girl sitting on the bed, early in the snuff film. 
Welles makes an adjustment to the enlarger's lens; framing tighter on the girl's face, REFOCUSING. 
INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT 
Welles comes out of the makeshift darkroom, holding a PHOTO of the girl.  He props the photo up on a dresser, stands looking at it.  Sad girl, staring forward. 
ON THE SCREEN: the FACES of TEENAGERS, boys and girls, one after the other, MISSING... MISSING... MISSING... 
INT.  CLEVELAND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
Welles searches the SHELVES of the LIBRARY.  He begins taking down various books... 
"Motion Picture Photography."  "Film Stocks and Physical Characteristics."  "Super 8 Filmmaking." 
INT.  CLEVELAND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- LATER -- MONTAGE 
In Welles' notepad: "SUPRAlux 544." Welles sits paging through technical photography books. 
INT. WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE 
Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded through the projector.  He turns the CLATTERING projector on and sits, watching. 
ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, then... the skinny GIRL in a negligee, sitting on the bed.  The CAMERA'S SPOTLIGHT casts long shadows.  The girl stares, oblivious... 
ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a bathroom, and the MASKED MAN enters, wearing the ghastly WRESTLING MASK.  The man goes to stand in front of the girl.  He seems to be saying something.  The FILM halts. 
Welles sits forward, hand on the projector.  He's seen something.  He PLAYS the FILM in REVERSE... 
ON THE WALL: the Masked Man walks backwards, away from the girl, backwards into the bathroom, door shutting... 
Welles stops the projector, not taking his eyes from the image.  He ADVANCES the film FRAME BY FRAME... 
FRAME BY FRAME... as the bathroom door opens, and the Masked Man enters... FRAME BY FRAME... as the Masked Man moves forward... door closing behind him... STOP... 
FREEZE FRAME: a THIRD MAN is reflected in the bathroom mirror.  Grainy and blurred, but he's in the room with the girl, standing there, captured in the mirror in this one brief instant just before the bathroom door closes. 
Welles walks to take a closer look, studying the almost ethereal image of the Third Man. 
EXT.  CLEVELAND STREET CORNER -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
Welles is in a PHONE BOOTH, feeds many quarters into the phone, waiting, looking at his notepad. 
WELLES (into PHONE) Hello, Mrs. Christian?  Tom Welles. Here's where we stand.  I checked the film stock and it's called Supra- lux 544.  The company that made that stock discontinued it in '92... (listens) Yeah, about five or six years ago. Anyway, do what you can to dig up your husband's old financial records, look for anything out of the ordinary... 
INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
Welles is back at the computer, alone, drinking coffee. ON THE COMPUTER: endless PHOTOS of MISSING CHILDREN. The PHONE CALL CONTINUES in VOICE OVER: 
WELLES (V.O., cont) Nobody really uses eight millimeter film anymore, so we can assume there are reasons our guys did.  First, they could develop it themselves if they had any sort of expertise. Obviously, this isn't the kind of movie you can just drop off at the one-hour photo... 
INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE 
Welles just stands, staring at the PHOTO of the GIRL. 
WELLES (V.O., cont) Second, the film that went through the camera is what we've got. There's no negative.  Unlike video, it wasn't meant to be duplicated. No reason for them to risk having more than one copy of their murder floating around... 
INT.  CLEVELAND BAR -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE 
Local bar.  Welles sits drinking with the archive's director, talking, smiling at something the director said. 
WELLES (V.O., cont) There don't seen to be many fingerprints on the film itself, but I'm going to have to be careful to leave them intact... 
INT.  MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
Welles is tired, unshaven.  He's moved on to the physical files, at one table, looking through HUNDREDS of MISSING PERSON BULLETINS.  Secretaries tend to other files. 
WELLES (V.O., cont) It's okay for yours and your husbands fingerprints to be on the film, but you'll have to use me as a middleman if you go to the police. That way I don't have to explain why my prints are on it... 
INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
Welles sits with the PROJECTOR ON, watching the film again. 
WELLES (V.O., cont) There were three men.  Two are obvious; the man in the mask and the man running the camera, but I caught a glimpse of a third man in a mirror.  It's nothing that can be used for identification, but he was there, watching... 
ON THE WALL: Masked Man touches the girl's mouth, presses his lips to hers.  Masked Man backs away, leaving frame, till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked Man standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid out... 
Welles notices something, puts the projector on FREEZE FRAME. 
WELLES (V.O., cont) So, there were three.  They would have kept it small, wouldn't have let anyone in on it they didn't have to.  That's all for now... except, I feel I should tell you... with this looking like it happened at least five or six years ago... 
Welles walks to the frozen IMAGE on the wall.  It shows the Masked Man's hands in frame, fingering the blades. 
WELLES (V.O., cont) Well, it's not very likely we'll ever find out who this girl was. (listens) I will, I'll keep trying. Goodbye. 
V.O. PHONE CALL ends with the SOUND of the PHONE HANGING UP. 
ON THE WALL: there's a DARK SPOT on Masked Man's hand, on the arch between his index finger and thumb.  Grainy and hard to make out, but looks like a small TATTOO. 
INT.  WELLES ROOM, BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- END MONTAGE 
Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded into his photo enlarger, projecting the IMAGE we just saw down onto the baseboard. 
He re-frames, CLOSER ON the masked Man's hand, REFOCUSING... the black spot is a little clearer, looks like a small STAR tattoo on the back of Masked Man's hand. 
INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY 
Welles sits hunched over the card catalog, still unshaven, drinking coffee, flipping through smaller PICTURES of MISSING CHILDREN in one drawer, one by one by one... 
Welles rolls his neck.  He looks to see the archive's director in the doorway.  The director nods, leaving. Welles gets back to it, stooped over the catalog. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
TITLE CARD:      three weeks later 
EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE -- DAY 
In the lot, Welles gets wearily from his car, smoking.  He tosses the cigarette, gets a Thermos off the front seat. 
INT.  MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY 
Welles pulls out a card catalog drawer labeled "North Carolina 1992," flipping through picture cards.  The FACES of TEENAGERS: a happy BOY with blue eyes... a red headed GIRL with freckles... a ruddy faced BOY... a pretty GIRL with a ribbon in her hair... a black GIRL in a pink dress... a blonde haired BOY with curly hair... 
WELLES You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her. 
Mrs. Mathews smiles. 
WELLES It's refreshing to actually sit down and meet someone face to face, someone nice like you. 
Welles smiles.  Mrs. Mathews takes out a cigarette.  Welles lights her, joins her in smoking, refers to his clipboard. 
WELLES So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left? 
MRS MATHEWS No. 
WELLES She just seemed... depressed... ? 
MRS MATHEWS She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes. 
WELLES What was she running from? 
MRS MATHEWS I don't know. 
WELLES If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide? 
MRS MATHEWS Yes. 
WELLES September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared. 
MRS MATHEWS We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend... 
WELLES Why do you think he did it? 
MRS MATHEWS It got to be too much for him. 
WELLES You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter... (pause) Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse? 
MRS MATHEWS There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left... 
WELLES I didn't mean to... 
MRS MATHEWS You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either. 
WELLES I had to ask.  I apologize. 
MRS MATHEWS No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts. 
Welles is miserable.  A few CUSTOMERS walk past, looking at Mrs. Mathews.  She tries not to notice then noticing. 
MRS MATHEWS People remember me from the news. (pause) Can you drive me back now? 
WELLES Of course. 
INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, MARY'S ROOM -- DAY 
Mrs. Mathews enters.  Welles follows. 
This was the girl's room, exactly as she left it -- POSTERS of ACTORS on the wall, many STUFFED ANIMALS on the pink sheets of the carefully made bed.  Perfectly preserved. 
MRS MATHEWS This is her room. 
Welles looks around, uncomfortable. Shelves have PICTURES of MARY with female friends, a collection of CERAMIC FIGURINES of CLOWNS and ANIMALS. 
MRS MATHEWS The police made a wreck of it, but I put it back exactly how it was. Just how she likes it. 
Welles takes a few steps into the room, looks down at a DESK where there are SIX brightly wrapped GIFTS. 
MRS MATHEWS 
Those are for her birthday.  One for every year she's missed.  They'll be waiting for her when she comes back. 
Welles is nearly overwhelmed by sadness, struggling to hide it.  He backs to the door, looks at his watch... 
WELLES I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow... 
MRS MATHEWS Okay. 
EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- DAY 
Welles escapes to his car, climbing in.  He starts it up... 
IN THE CAR 
Welles drives, tears welling up in his eyes.  He has to pull over and park, wiping his tears, fighting for composure. 
INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT 
Welles has unpacked.  He's on the bed, on his CELLULAR... 
WELLES (into phone) You should be able to take a shower and still have hot water left, honey. (listens) Call him back and tell him I said so.  The goddamn thing's still under warranty. (listens) I'm okay.  It's hard here.  It's hard. (listens) I've got a lead I have to follow through.  To be honest, I don't think I'm going to get very far. I miss you.  I love you. 
INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING 
Welles sits at the kitchen table.  Mrs. Mathews makes coffee.  The home's decor is cheap and flowery. 
MRS MATHEWS We weren't religious.  We never forced religion down her throat, like I've seen some parents do to their kids.  We never made her go to church.  But, after Mary was gone, that's when I got religious. 
Mrs. Mathews brings two cups of coffee, sits. 
MRS MATHEWS Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church. 
WELLES We're all like that. 
MRS MATHEWS Are you religious? 
WELLES No. 
MRS MATHEWS You should be. 
INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Mrs. Mathews still gazes into the TV.  Welles passes the doorway, not looking in, heading to the front door, opening the door and walking out... 
Mrs. Mathews doesn't even notice, doesn't look up. 
EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- NIGHT 
Welles crosses the front lawn, not looking back, heading to the street, getting into his car, starting his car, doing a U-turn, driving away down the street. 
EXT.  FAYETTEVILLE AIRPORT, LONG TERM PARKING -- MORNING 
Welles' boxes of belongings are piled in the back seat of his car.  Welles covers them with a blanket, shuts the door. 
Welles opens the trunk of his car, pulls back the carpeting. He opens the brown BRIEFCASE.  The briefcase is full of CASH, about $10,000, twenties and fifties in bundles. 
Welles transfers half the money into a carry-on bag, shuts the briefcase, covers it, closes the trunk. 
INT.  AIRPLANE, COACH -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE 
The cabin's half-full, dark.  Passengers sleep.  Under the only illuminated reading light, Welles reads the PHOTOCOPIED DIARY.  MARY'S VOICE is a again a flat monotone... 
MARY'S VOICE (V.O.) (as Welles reads) "Dear diary.  I have a big math test tomorrow.  I have to get better grades.  How come everybody does better than me?  Kathy doesn't even study and she gets B's.  Two boys got in a fight after school today. One boy knocked the other boy's tooth out, at least that's what it looked like.  His nose and mouth were bleeding all over the place..."

INT.  HOLLYWOOD HOTEL -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
Welles' suitcase is open on the bed.  Welles sits in a chair with his feet up, sweating in the heat, reading the DIARY. 
MARY'S VOICE (V.O.) (as Welles reads) "... We're reading The Great Gatsby in English class.  It's the story of this guy who has lots of fancy parties and all his friends come around and party with him, but later when he dies nobody comes to his funeral.  Someone said there's a movie about it, but I looked in the video store and it wasn't there." 
Welles flips pages, further back in the DIARY... 
MARY'S VOICE (V.O.) (as Welles reads) "Dear diary.  I started my first job last week working part time at Price Mart department store..." 
INT.  LOS ANGELES BANK, SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
Welles and a BANK EMPLOYEE both put keys into a SAFE DEPOSIT BOX, unlocking it and sliding out the metal drawer. 
MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont) "... The people I work with are all old and fat.  All they live for is their next coffee break so they can smoke..." 
INT.  BANK, PRIVACY BOOTH -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
Welles is alone, opens the empty safe deposit drawer, takes the 8MM FILM from his pocket and puts it in the drawer. 
MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont) "... They eat lunch at the snack counter.  Hot dogs and soft pretzels.  Nachos with that orange cheese that comes out of a pump.  I don't know what I'd do if I'm still working there when I get old..." 
EXT.  YOUTH HOSTEL -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
A large NEON CROSS identifies this HOSTEL in mid-Hollywood.

INT.  YOUTH HOSTEL -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
Welles talks to the MAN behind the counter, shows the PICTURE of MARY taken from Mrs. Mathews' house. 
MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont) "... Everyone's always telling me how pretty I am.  I don't think I am.  When I look in the mirror I wonder who they're talking about." 
The MAN behind the counter shakes his head. 
INT.  HOMELESS SHELTER -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
A run-down shelter.  Welles shows the PICTURE of MARY to the PROPRIETOR, explaining.  The proprietor shakes his head.

EXT.  YWCA, LIVING QUARTERS -- DAY -- MONTAGE 
Welles continues his trek, standing in the dank hallway of a YWCA DORMITORY, showing the PICTURE to a COUNSELOR. 
MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont) "... It was the middle of the day, but we held hands.  I think he likes me.  I really like him.  He has black hair and grey eyes..." 
EXT.  LA FREEWAY -- DUSK -- MONTAGE 
Welles sits in his rental CAR, in a massive TRAFFIC JAM. 
MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont) "... He opened the car door for me and paid for the movie.  When he took me home he said we should go out again soon.  I hope he calls..." 
EXT.  HOLLYWOOD, RED LIGHT DISTRICT -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE 
Welles drives, looking out the windshield... at decaying "PEEP SHOWS," an "ADULT BOOKSHOP" and "SEX SHOP." 
MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont) "Dear diary.  Janet says she slept with her boyfriend.  I can't believe it.  She says they did it last weekend while her parents were out of town..." 
EXT.  HOLLYWOOD, SUNSET BOULEVARD -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE 
Welles drives, watching overweight PROSTITUTES and tall, muscular TRANSVESTITES prowling the sidewalks in mini-skirts and stained, tight spandex pants. 
MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont) "... She said she liked it, but she didn't seem too happy.  She didn't tell me many details.  She said he used a condom." 
EXT.  SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE 
Teenaged MALE PROSTITUTES hang out in front of a PIZZA PARLOR.  A few have their shirts off, crewcut and muscular. 
WELLES Snuff? 
ANGRY DEALER What you see is what I got, mister. 
WELLES You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend. 
ANGRY DEALER There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off? 
The dealer sits and keeps counting cash. Welles moves on Beyond the tables there's a CURTAINED DOORWAY.  Welles walks to it, enters... 
INSIDE THE CURTAIN 
Folding chairs face a SCREEN.  A PROJECTOR shows a silent movie; a BUXOM WOMAN in nurses uniform prepares an enema bag and tube.  A hairy, overweight MAN lays face down on an examination table, naked, arms tied behind his back. 
In the darkness, a MAN shifts in his chair, grunting, obviously masturbating.  A few chairs away, a man is bent over, moving his head in the lap of SOMEONE in a BLONDE WIG. 
A LARGE MAN approaches Welles from the dark. 
LARGE MAN You have to pay to come in here. 
Welles backs away, shuts the curtain. 
INT.  ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT 
Not many people in the place.  Welles drinks coffee.  Max eats a huge breakfast. 
MAX You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go. 
WELLES Interesting theory. 
MAX What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product. 
WELLES Child pornography. 
MAX There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one. 
WELLES Snuff films. 
MAX I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing. 
WELLES What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see? 
MAX First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is. 
Welles watches Max eat. 
WELLES How old are you? 
MAX Twenty-five. 
WELLES Where are your parents? 
MAX I don't know, where are yours? 
WELLES I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this? 
MAX I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about? 
WELLES You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else. 
MAX Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers. 
WELLES You're telling me it doesn't get to you? 
MAX You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops? 
WELLES What about me? 
MAX I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids? 
WELLES A daughter. 
MAX So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this? 
WELLES Good question. 
EXT.  ALL NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT 
Max and Welles comes out to the sidewalk, talking. 
ACROSS THE STREET 
INSIDE A PARKED CAR, through the windshield, SOMEONE watches Max and Welles say goodnight.  Max walks to a waiting taxi. 
It's the sinister lawyer watching, LONGDALE, the late Mr. Christian's attorney, watching Welles go to his rental car. 
INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE 
Welles is seated, PROJECTOR RUNNING, watching the 8MM film. 
The last of the film makes its way through, threading out. The take-up reel spins, the film's tail flapping... 
Welles stares at the blank white square of light projected onto the wall.  CELLULAR PHONE is HEARD RINGING... 
Welles finally looks to the projector, turns it off.  The PHONE'S RINGING.  Welles goes to sit on the bed, looking at the cellular phone on the bedside table.  RINGING... 
Welles lets it RING.  RINGING... RINGING... till it finally stops.  Welles lays back on the bed and shuts his eyes. 
INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- DAY 
Mrs. Christian is behind the desk, surrounded by BOXES of BANK RECORDS and FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, on the PHONE. 
MRS CHRISTIAN (into phone) My husband had five cash accounts he used to temporarily hold stock profits.  Between November of 1991 and March of 1992, he wrote one check out to cash from each account. He wrote these himself... 
INT.  PHONE BOOTH, HOLLYWOOD -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS 
MARY'S VOICE (V.O.) (as Welles reads) "Star light, star bright, First star I've seen tonight, Wish I may, wish I might, Have this wish I wish tonight." 
Welles goes to a drawer, takes out the photocopy of Mary's DIARY.  He turns to the ragged edge of the torn page, puts the DIARY PAGE against it.  Perfect match. 
Welles stands looking at the poem.  He turns the page over, finds written, in cursive: 
Models Wanted 213-555-6643 
EXT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY 
Welles dials the number off the back of the torn diary page, phone to his ear.  It RINGS, RINGS, RINGS... 
MAN'S VOICE (V.O.) (from phone) Celebrity Films. 
Welles hangs up, begins searching the booth's YELLOW PAGES. 
EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY 
A poverty stricken business section of Wilshire.  Welles gets out of his parked car, looks up at a decaying Art Deco building that's painted blue top-to-bottom. 
Welles crosses through traffic. 
INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, LOBBY -- DAY 
Welles studies the REGISTRY, finds "Celebrity Films." 
INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- DAY 
Paint's peeling.  Walls are water stained.  Welles climbs stairs, winded, sweating, up the stairwell... 
INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- DAY 
Welles comes out a stairwell DOOR, catching his breath.  A couple of SECRETARIES wait for the elevator.  Welles moves down the hall, around a corner. 
Each office door has a window of pebbled, translucent glass. There's a "Dental Office," "Wilson Travel Cruises," and at the end of the hall, "Celebrity Films Inc., Eddie Poole, Professional Casting and Distribution, Suite 804." 
Welles heads back the way he came. 
EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY 
Welles crosses back to the other side of the street, goes to stand near his car.  He looks up at the blue office building, counting up floors, counting windows across. 
Satisfied, he turns, backing up, looking up at the tall OFFICE BUILDING across from the blue building.  There's a sign on this adjacent building, "OFFICE SPACE AVAILABLE." 
INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE, 9TH FLOOR -- DAY 
Empty office.  Welles is let in by a disinterested LANDLORD. Welles gives a cursory look around, goes to the windows and opens the blinds. 
These windows afford an excellent view of the blue building across the street, at about 8th floor level. 
WELLES This is better. (turns to landlord) This will be fine. 
INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- NIGHT 
Welles has transferred most of his belongings here, SUITCASE open on the floor, CARD TABLE set up with fast food on it, an ARMY COT against one wall.  Welles sits in a chair at the window, looks through BINOCULARS on a TRIPOD. 
WELLES' P.O.V., THROUGH BINOCULARS: searching up the dark floors of the blue building, as Welles counts under his breath.  Moving over... stopping on one window, FOCUSING... 
Welles locks the tripod.  He goes to sit on the army cot, picks up his CELLULAR.  He looks at the phone, deciding. He puts down the phone.  He turns off the LAMP on the floor, lays back in the cot, going to sleep. 
INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY 
WELLES' P.O.V., THROUGH BINOCULARS: watching the window of Celebrity Films Inc.  We can see most of the office from here.  It's crowded with junk, BOXES, piles of VIDEO TAPES. There's a disorganized DESK by the window. 
Welles sits looking through the binoculars. 
THROUGH BINOCULARS: a pudgy man, EDDIE POOLE, in a loud, print shirt, comes to sit at the desk, looks through mail. He smells sleazy even from here, lots of jewelry, Lots of rings.  He drinks coffee, answers the phone.  He talks into the phone, looking for something on his desk, agitation growing, till he's shouting, then slams the phone down. 
Welles rises.  He looks to the wall where THREE PHOTOGRAPHS culled from the snuff film are pinned up; the picture of Mary, the picture of Masked Man's tattooed hand, and... 
... the grainy image of the Third Man in the mirror. Welles comes to study this third photo. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY 
THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie packs VIDEO TAPES into a box, covering them with Styrofoam peanuts, sealing the box. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY 
THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie finishes a call and hangs up.  He sits back in his chair.  He starts looking in his desk drawers, finds a MAGAZINE and opens it on the desk.  It's porn.  Eddie turns pages, looking at naked women.  He sits back in his chair, begins unbuckling his belt. 
Welles pulls back from the binoculars in disgust. 
WELLES No thank you. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- NIGHT 
THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's on the phone, pouring himself a drink from the liquor bottle on his desk, finishing the call, hanging up.  He shakes his head in disgust, drinks the drink, walks out of view.  After a moment, the lights go out. 
EXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS -- NIGHT 
An old, dented CAR makes its way up the tight, twisting roads of the Hollywood Hills.  Eddie's at the wheel.  Not far behind, Welles' rental car follows... 
FURTHER ON 
Eddie's car pulls into the driveway under the porch of a ramshackle HOUSE, parks.  Welles' car passes by... 
FURTHER, AROUND A CURVE 
Welles' car slows once it's out of sight, turns around, moving back down the hill, slowly... 
WELLES (V.O.) I know what you did. 
EDDIE (V.O.) What? 
WELLES (V.O.) I know what you did. 
EDDIE (V.O.) Who is this. 
WELLES (V.O.) You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago... 
EDDIE (V.O.) What the fuck are you.. ? 
WELLES (V.O.) You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good. 
Welles hits disconnect, still looking through binoculars. 
THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's slow to hang up the phone.  He stands, looking down at the phone, frozen.  Finally, he runs his hands through his hair, looks around the room, sits back down.  He gets out his bottle and pours himself a drink. 
Welles watches through binoculars, puts headphones back on. 
WELLES Come on, Eddie... 
THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie sits motionless. 
WELLES (O.S.) ... come on... 
THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie picks up the phone, DIALS a NUMBER.  We hear the PHONE RING in the HEADPHONES 
MAN'S VOICE (V.O.) (through headphones) ... Hello? 
EDDIE (V.O.) (through headphones) Dino, it's Eddie... Eddie Poole... 
DINO (V.O.) What do you want? 
EDDIE (V.O.) I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop. 
DINO (V.O.) What are you talking about? 
EDDIE (V.O.) The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop... 
DINO (V.O.) Bullshit. 
EDDIE (V.O.) I'm telling you... 
DINO (V.O.) Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ? 
EDDIE (V.O.) Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out! 
DINO (V.O.) There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader. 
EDDIE (V.O.) Dino... 
DINO (V.O) Nobody knows anything. 
THROUGH BINOCULARS: as DINO is HEARD HANGING UP, Eddie reacts, picks up his phone and throws it across the office. 
Welles sits back, trying to accept the realization that he's found them.  He looks to the PHOTO of the Third Man. 
WELLES That is you, isn't it, Eddie? 
Welles goes to the RECORDER, turns on the TONE DECODER.  Its LED window LIGHTS UP.  Welles hits STOP, REWIND, PLAY... 
WELLES VOICE (V.O.) (from recorder) ... and your pals, you're fucked... 
Hits FAST FORWARD... hits PLAY, watching the TONE DECODER. From the RECORDER, the SOUND of EDDIE DIALING a NUMBER on his touch tone phone... and as EACH TONE is HEARD, a corresponding NUMBER appears on the DECODER'S LED readout: 
The recorder continues, REPLAYING the CONVERSATION between Eddie and Dino, while Welles studies the green LED digits. 
WELLES (quiet, to himself) Two one two. 
EXT.  MANHATTAN CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING -- NIGHT 
The brilliant lights of New York's peerless skyscrapers. 
EXT.  59TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT 
FOLLOW Welles' Ford as it moves along with traffic, crossing the 59th Street Bridge, into the heart of Manhattan. 
EXT.  BANK -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY 
"Chase Manhattan Bank," mid-town. 
INT.  CHASE MANHATTAN BANK, SAFE DEPOSIT BOOTH -- DAY 
Welles puts the 8MM FILM into SAFE DEPOSIT DRAWER, shuts it. 
INT.  NY PUBLIC LIBRARY, REFERENCE -- DAY 
Busy and crowded, but quiet.  Welles places a massive tome down on a table:  "Haines Criss-Cross Directory." 
Welles sits, takes out his notepad, referring to the phone number written: "(212) 555-9906."  He opens the reference book, searching pages... 
Thousands of TELEPHONE NUMBERS are LISTED in SEQUENCE, each with an address.  Welles runs his finger down the page. 
EXT.  SOHO STREETS -- DAY 
PEDESTRIANS everywhere.  Streets are clogged with DELIVERY TRUCKS loading and unloading.  Cars horns blow.  Welles walks to an old, WAREHOUSE BUILDING shoulder to shoulder with other buildings, labeled "1204" in burnished steel. 
Welles climbs the stairs, examines the buzzers. 
The top button's labeled "Greystone Imports," the bottom button reads "Lang Interior Design, by appt."  The middle button is labeled only by a drawing of a BLACK WIDOW SPIDER. 
Welles looks up at the building. 
EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, SOHO -- LATER DAY 
MRS. CHRISTIAN is HEARD COUGHING.  Welles waits. 
WELLES I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve. 
MRS CHRISTIAN How will I get it to you? 
WELLES If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it. 
EXT.  MOTEL, HELL'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT 
A TAXI pulls over in front of this flea-bag motel.  Max gets out with a SUITCASE, looks at the dubious accommodations. 
INT.  MOTEL, MAX'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
Max enters with Welles, turns on a light and throws his suitcase on the bed.  The room is disgusting. 
MAX You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious. 
WELLES It's their Presidential Suite. 
MAX Great. 
Max looks in the bathroom. 
MAX Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag? 
WELLES It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me? 
Max opens his suitcase, takes out THREE VIDEO TAPES. 
He hands them to Welles.  The boxes are covered in jumbled PHOTO COLLAGES: American flag, S+M men and women, a skull, mannequins, a scorpion, cut-outs of arms, legs and eyeballs. 
MAX Dino Velvet. 
INT.  WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT 
Welles is lit by the flicker from the TELEVISION SCREEN.  WE SEE NOTHING.  We HEAR the rhythmic MUFFLED MOANS of a WOMAN from the TV, can't tell if it's pleasure or pain. 
Max is asleep in the bed, PIZZA BOX near his feet. 
Welles drinks beer, gets up and ejects the CASSETTE from a VCR, tosses it aside, tired.  He picks another Dino Velvet TAPE, puts it in, sits. 
ON TV: GOTHIC ROCK is HEARD over old, scratchy IMAGES: of Klansmen around a burning cross... Dracula menacing a sleeping woman... a man in a Devil costume dancing... 
Welles opens another beer. 
ON TV: a WOMAN is tied up, arms in the air, hanging from the ceiling, gagged and blindfolded, in a dungeon lit by candelabras.  Then, glimpsed IMAGES: worms writhing in slime... gargoyles... a guillotine falling.  Then, the bound woman, struggling.  A MASKED MAN in a leather jacket enters. He wears a LEATHER MASK with zipper eyes and mouth... 
This focuses Welles' attention. 
ON TV: the Masked Man circles the captured woman... 
WELLES Max... wake up... 
Max awakens, rolling over, groggy. 
MAX Wha... ? 
WELLES (points at TV) Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he? 
Max tries to see, eyes barely open. 
MAX He's one of the lunatics Dino uses. He's in a bunch of these. 
Welles watches.  On the TV, Masked Man takes off his jacket shirtless, reveals an impossibly muscled body.  Huge arms, thick chest, oiled, dotted in pimples. 
MAX Why?  He have something to do with whatever you're into? 
Still watching the behemoth on TV, Welles is less sure. 
ON TV: the bulging Masked Man flexes, ripped. 
WELLES No... it's nothing... that's not him. 
Welles rubs his eyes, sits back.  Max sits up, watching. 
ON TV: Masked Man pulls the bound woman's head back by her hair, licks her face with his thick tongue... 
CLOSE ON: Masked Man grips the woman's head, still licking. He pulls down the woman's blindfold... 
Welles sits forward, realizing, horrified... 
Welles goes to the VCR, hits PAUSE.  The IMAGE on TV FREEZES.  Welles goes back, FRAME by FRAME... 
... to the CLOSE UP where Masked Man grips the woman's face. FREEZE FRAME.  On Masked Man's hand: a TATTOO, on the arch between his forefinger and thumb, same as the scrawny Masked Man in the snuff film.  A PENTAGRAM TATTOO. 
WELLES Who is he? 
MAX I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players... 
WELLES Who is he, his name? 
MAX Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine. 
Welles hits PLAY.  On TV, Masked Man runs his hands up and down the woman's body.  The woman's eyes are filled with fear.  Welles sits, unnerved, watching. 
MAX They say he's half brain-dead from all the steroids he's using. 
Max rolls over, trying to get back to sleep. 
MAX He's a brutal motherfucker, man.  He loves what he does for a living. 
INT.  WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- DAY 
Welles enters, carries an OVERNIGHT PACKAGE and his LOCK BOX.  At the desk, he tears open the package, opens the MANILA ENVELOPE inside; finds FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS in thousand dollar bills, wrapped in plastic and masking tape. 
WELLES And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask. 
DINO VELVET Machine. 
WELLES If it's not him, there's no deal. 
Dino drums his painted fingernails on his lips. 
DINO VELVET He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand. 
WELLES We can do that. 
DINO VELVET Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit? (off Welles' nod) Very good. 
Dino stands, picks up a still CAMERA off his desk and comes to look at Welles, studying him. 
DINO VELVET You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind? 
WELLES I'd rather you didn't. 
DINO VELVET What's the problem? 
WELLES I'm camera shy. 
DINO VELVET You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture? 
WELLES Those are two different kinds of trust. (stands) Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business. 
Welles leaves.  Max goes with him.  Dino watches them leave. 
EXT.  MANHATTAN STREET -- NIGHT 
HORNS BLARE.  TWO CARS have collided head-on.  A large CROWD gathers.  One windshield's shattered, blood spattered.  The driver is slumped over the wheel, gushing blood. 
On a nearby street corner, Welles in on a PAY PHONE. HEAVY METAL can be HEARD filtered through the receiver. 
WELLES (into phone) So, what do you say? 
INT.  DINO VELVET'S OFFICE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS 
Dino's stands in the middle of his office, naked, his back to us, 8MM camera in hand, on the phone.  A NAKED WOMAN dances for Dino.  A Heavy Metal MUSIC VIDEO plays on a TV. 
DINO VELVET (into phone) I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars. 
WELLES (V.O.) (from phone) Machine's in? 
DINO VELVET (into phone) He's in.  It will be his pleasure. 
INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS 
DINO VELVET (V.O.) (from phone) Be at 366 Hoyt Avenue, three o'clock, tomorrow. 
Welles digs out his notepad, writing. 
WELLES (into phone) Where's that? 
DINO VELVET (V.O.) Brooklyn.  Don't be late. 
EXT.  MOTEL COURTYARD, POOL -- NIGHT 
HORNS and TRAFFIC are HEARD.  Max and Welles sit in lawn chairs at the tiny pool.  Welles smokes.  Max drinks beer. They watch an ELDERLY WOMAN in a one piece bathing suit climb from the pool and walk to the diving board, diving in. 
MAX What's next? 
WELLES I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask. 
MAX Still don't want to tell me what you're doing? 
WELLES Nope. 
The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board. Welles takes out a thick ENVELOPE, hands it to Max. 
WELLES This is for you. 
Max doesn't understand, opens the envelope, finds about fifteen thousand dollars in the envelope. 
MAX What's this? 
WELLES It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services. 
Max looks at it again, can't believe it. 
MAX Look... that's awful generous and everything... 
WELLES It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay? (pause) Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever. 
Welles puts his cigarette out, stands. 
WELLES I'll see you around. 
Welles walks away, heading to his room.  Max watches him go, doesn't know what to say, looks in the envelope. 
The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board. 
EXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS -- DAY 
A deserted, war zone neighborhood of abandoned, graffittied buildings.  A few burnt out cars on the street.  Welles drives through, watchful. 
Welles drives past a huge TWO-STORY WAREHOUSE, does a u-turn. He parks the car. 
INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY 
Welles checks his gun, returns it to his holster. 
EXT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY 
Welles looks across to the car... The sinister lawyer, Longdale, gets out from behind the wheel and hands the keys to Machine, walks this way... 
EDDIE This is the fucker?  Motherfucker, doesn't look like anything... 
Eddie walks around the bed, studies Welles.  Welles watches him.  Eddie goes to stand behind Welles, rushes forward... 
PUNCHES Welles in the side of the head. Welles goes down, clutching his face. 
EDDIE Doesn't look like shit. 
Eddie pulls Welles to his feet, throws him against the bed, frisking him from head to toe. 
Longdale comes to stand beside Dino, nervous, taking out a tiny HANDGUN and pointing it at Welles.  Welles looks up, holding his head, afraid, sits on the bed. 
DINO VELVET (to Welles) You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you? 
WELLES I remember him. 
LONGDALE Let's get this over with. 
DINO VELVET Fine idea. 
Dino comes to sit on the bed beside Welles. 
DINO VELVET You're going to go get the film you received from Mrs. Christian, bring it here and put it in my hand.  And to save time, so we make this as efficient as possible, there's an incentive... 
Dino puts his fingers in his mouth, lets out a sharp WHISTLE. 
Across the warehouse, Machine uses the car keys to open the trunk of the car, pulls SOMEONE out... 
It's Max, beaten bloody, bound, face swollen, gagged, hardly conscious.  Machine throws him to the floor. 
WELLES No... 
Welles tries to go towards Max, yanked back by the handcuffs, pulls the bed a few inches, but it's heavy. 
DINO VELVET Friend of yours? 
WELLES Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go... 
DINO VELVET Can you guess what I'm going to say next? 
WELLES He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this... 
DINO VELVET Bring the film, or we kill him. 
Sorrow and rage rises up in Welles, but there's no choice. 
WELLES I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city... 
DINO VELVET How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company. 
Dino takes out HANDCUFF KEYS, throws them to Longdale. Longdale approaches Welles carefully, unlocking him. 
DINO VELVET Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max. 
EDDIE Move it, dirtbag... ! 
Eddie comes to SHOVE Welles.  Welles stumbles to the ground, gets to his feet.  Welles walks, takes one last glance back towards Max.  Longdale follows. 
DINO VELVET (watching them go) Do hurry. 
EXT.  MANHATTAN STREETS -- DAY 
Welles' car moves in the slow flow of traffic into mid-town. 
INT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS 
Welles is at the wheel.  Longdale is in the passenger seat, gun held in his lap. 
WELLES You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself. 
LONGDALE Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature. 
WELLES So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege. 
LONGDALE That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly. 
WELLES Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money. 
LONGDALE I was well compensated. 
WELLES That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me? 
LONGDALE Never mind how I found you. 
WELLES Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies... 
LONGDALE They're no friends of mine. 
WELLES Except, you're willing commit murder with them. 
LONGDALE None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers. 
WELLES Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her. 
Welles looks at Longdale. 
WELLES You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one... 
LONGDALE Shut up. 
WELLES Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered. 
LONGDALE Shut your mouth and drive! 
Machine comes to drag Welles towards the bed. 
Dino unspools the film, holding it up to examine it. 
Machine handcuffs Welles to the metal bedframe.  Welles falls to his knees, holding his face. Eddie PUNCHES Welles in the head. 
EDDIE You're a dead man. 
DINO VELVET Leave him alone. 
EDDIE Fuck off. 
Eddie PUNCHES Welles in the kidney.  Welles tries to protect himself.  Eddie raises his fist to punch again, but Machine catches Eddie's fist, throws Eddie back... 
EDDIE What the fuck... ! 
DINO I promised him to Machine. 
Eddie looks up at Machine, who towers over him. 
EDDIE ... sorry... 
DINO VELVET First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles... 
Welles looks up through tears... Dino drops the 8MM FILM on the floor, takes a small bottle of lighter fluid from his pocket.  Longdale comes to watch. 
Welles watches helpless, agonizing... 
WELLES Don't... please... 
Dino drops the film to the floor, sprays it with fluid, takes out matches, light one, drops it... 
The 8MM FILM goes up in flame... 
Welles watches, quaking, hysterical, trying to pull himself towards the flame, dragging the bed... 
The film is destroyed by flame... 
Welles gives up, presses his face to the floor, eyes shut. 
DINO VELVET And so it ends.  It's as if she never existed. 
Welles falls back, gasping, wiping blood and tears and spittle from his face, getting slowly, to his feet. 
DINO VELVET Don't blame yourself.  You were in way over your head. 
He looks to Max's corpse, to the smoldering film... Swallowing back his fear, panic and rage... 
WELLES Motherfuckers.  Small time, motherfuckers... !  Tell me something... 
Welles spits blood, hangs onto the bed for support. 
WELLES I know why you did it, Dino, Eddie... but, why'd the lawyer do it?  Must have been a helluva lot of money, right?  One fuckload of money... 
Welles sits on the bed, eyes burning with fury. 
WELLES So, what are you all still doing small time, huh?  What are you still doing in the sewer, Eddie?! Christian gave Longdale a million dollars to find him a snuff film. How much did you ever see... ? 
Eddie and Dino look to Longdale. 
EDDIE What's he talking about? 
WELLES One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had... 
Longdale's getting very nervous. 
LONGDALE He's lying. 
WELLES Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself? 
Eddie walks towards Longdale... 
EDDIE What the fuck's he talking about? 
Longdale takes out his gun, aims it at Machine, Dino and Eddie, scared... 
LONGDALE Stay away from me. 
DINO VELVET What's going on, Longdale?  Did this happen? 
EDDIE You sell us short, you fuck? 
LONGDALE Stay back!  You have a gun, Eddie, show it to me.  Now! 
Eddie slowly takes out his gun, seething. 
LONGDALE Put it on the ground, kick it here... 
Eddie puts the gun down, kicks it... Longdale picks it up, throws it far away. 
EDDIE You fucking lawyer... 
LONGDALE Move back!  All of you... move! 
Machine, Dino and Eddie stand between Longdale and the car with tinted windows parked across the warehouse... 
DINO VELVET What were you thinking? 
Welles watches as Machine, Dino and Eddie back slowly away from Longdale.  Longdale's gun hand is shaky... 
Welles tries to drag himself towards the table where his gun and bullets are, dragging the bed, inch by inch... 
Longdale back away, trying to angle around the menacing trio so he can get to the car... 
LONGDALE Back off!  Everything's been taken care of, and I'm leaving now... 
AMY Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through... 
WELLES I don't know what to say 
AMY You're killing me... 
WELLES Don't... 
AMY What was I supposed to think happened to you?! 
WELLES Amy... 
Welles goes to Amy, but she pulls away.  She sits on the bed.  Cindy's still crying.  Welles sits beside Amy, puts her arms around her. 
WELLES Forgive me. 
Amy cradles Cindy.  Welles rests his head on Amy's shoulder, places one hand on Cindy. 
WELLES We have to stay here a few days. I'll get more clothing from the house if I can.  I'm sorry. (pause) We're going to be okay. 
Welles rises.  He goes to the PHONE, starts dialing.  Amy looks at him, wipes tears. 
AMY Who are you calling? 
WELLES Mrs. Christian. 
AMY What? 
WELLES She's all I've got.  She's the only witness. 
AMY Tom... she's dead. 
Welles looks to Amy. 
AMY She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper... 
WELLES I just talked to her. 
Cindy's crying.  Welles sits into a chair, trying to understand this, his mind racing.  He hangs up the phone. 
AMY How could you not know? 
Misery pulls down the corners of Welles' mouth.  He tries to find words, but none come.  He sits forward and hides his face in his hands, overwhelmed.  Cindy's crying. 
INT.  HOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT 
Cindy sleeps, encircled by pillows and blankets on the bed. Amy watches her, runs her hand gently across Cindy's head. 
Amy rises, turns out the light, goes to a BALCONY DOOR... 
EXT.  HOTEL ROOM, BALCONY -- NIGHT 
Welles sits with his feet up on the balcony rail, looking into the parking lot.  Amy joins him, sits. 
AMY Promise you'll stay. 
Welles looks at Amy. 
WELLES Promise you won't go back there, wherever you were.  Whatever it was, forget it. 
Welles takes a deep breath, nods his head. 
AMY Promise me. 
Welles looks out into the night sky of stars. 
WELLES I promise. 
Amy comes to kiss Welles.  Welles wraps his arms around her and holds her tight.  She holds him. 
INT.  HOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT 
Amy is asleep on the bed beside Cindy.  Welles comes out from the bathroom in a fresh shirt and suit, turns off the bathroom light.  He stands looking at Cindy and Amy. 
EXT.  HOTEL -- NIGHT 
Welles exits the hotel, heading to his Ford. 
INT.  WELLES' CAR -- NIGHT 
Welles drives, staring ahead.  Through the windshield, the headlights illuminate the endless roadway. 
EXT.  KENNEDY AIRPORT -- NIGHT 
Airplanes take flight.  Manhattan glitters in the distance. 
EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY 
Eddie Poole's building.  A typically bright, sunny LA day. In the street, Welles parks a rental car, gets out. 
INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- DAY 
ELEVATOR doors open and Welles gets off.  He moves down the hall, around a corner, heading to "Celebrity Films." 
Welles tries the door knob, finds it locked.  He looks around, takes two steps back, KICKS forward... SMASHES the translucent glass of the door... 
INT.  CELEBRITY FILMS OFFICE -- DAY 
Welles pushes broken glass out of the way, reaches in to open the door.  The office has been cleaned out, trash on the floor, desk drawers hanging open and empty, shelves empty, posters gone... 
Welles grabs one of the file cabinets, pulls it open, finds it empty, pulls it all the way out and throws it. 
INT.  8TH FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY 
People peer out from other offices, worried.  Welles exits Eddie's office, ignoring them, goes around the corner, straight to the STAIRWELL, heading downstairs... 
Welles keeps going around Eddie's ankles with the duct tape, till Eddie's securely bound. 
He rips the tape roll free and gets up, walking out... 
EDDIE Fucking pussy! 
EXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT 
Welles pulls the door closed behind him, walks to his car. 
IN THE CAR 
Welles opens the passenger door and sits, shaken, at his wit's end.  He opens the glove compartment, finds cigarettes, digs one out and lights it. 
He looks back to the motel room. 
He looks down to the glove compartment, at his CELLULAR PHONE.  After a moment, Welles picks up the phone, looks at it in his hand. 
IN THE LOT 
Welles gets out of the car, gets up on the hood, lays back, staring at the sky.  He closes his eyes, smokes. 
Welles opens the phone, looks at the illuminated numbers. He digs in his suit jacket pocket, takes out his notepad, pages through, studies one page. 
Welles sits up.  He gathers himself, throws his cigarette, dials a number, puts the cellular to his ear, afraid... 
MRS MATHEWS (V.O.) (from phone) Hello... ? 
WELLES (into phone) Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter... 
MRS MATHEWS (V.O.) (from phone) I remember.  You just left... 
WELLES (into phone) I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne... (struggling) When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true... 
Welles climbs off the car, paces, aching with misery... 
MRS MATHEWS (V.O.) What are you talking about... ? 
WELLES She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress... 
MRS MATHEWS (V.O.) What... ? 
Tears comes to Welles' eyes.  It's the hardest thing he's ever had to do in his entire life. 
WELLES Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead. 
MRS MATHEWS Who is this... ? 
WELLES Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her... 
MRS MATHEWS (V.O.) Who are you? 
WELLES They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her... 
MRS MATHEWS No... 
WELLES He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes... 
MRS MATHEWS (V.O.) No... no... no... 
WELLES They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her... 
MRS MATHEWS (V.O.) Why... why are you doing this to me... ? 
WELLES They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time... 
MRS MATHEWS is HEARD SCREAMING, letting out a CHOCKING SOB. Welles falls back against the car, holds his head, weeping... 
WELLES I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... there wasn't anything anyone could do... 
Welles pushes disconnect, lowers the phone, drops it to the ground, utterly drained.  He puts his forearm over his eyes, gasping, sucking air... 
He looks to the motel room, tamping down his sorrow, willing it to fuel his rage... 
He takes out his gun, hands unsteady, determined, opens the gun and pours the bullets out.  He closes the gun and walks towards the motel room... 
INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
Welles SHOVES the door aside.  The door's hinge breaks and the door falls... 
Eddie sits propped up against one wall, turns to look... 
The door SLAMS to the floor. 
Welles moves forward, enraged, closing on Eddie, raising his arm with the gun grasped by the butt... 
Eddie's eyes go wide with fear... 
Welles SWINGS the gun down at Eddie's head... 
EXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS 
The only SOUNDS come from the NIGHT FOREST.  CRICKETS and distant BIRDS.  We can't see anything but the TOTAL DARKNESS through the open door of the room.  A CAR is HEARD, getting LOUDER as it passes, FAINTER as it gets further away. 
Finally, Welles comes to the doorway, in shock, steadying himself against the door frame, shirt and suit spattered red.  His gun hand and gun are soaked with dripping blood. 
Welles looks back into the room, backing away.  He turns and goes to his car... 
IN THE CAR 
Welles climbs in the driver's side, shoves his bloody gun into his holster, tries to wipe blood from his hand onto his shirt, revolted.  He starts the car. 
INT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Welles enters and crosses through... 
EXT.  QUEENS STREET -- DAY 
A relatively quiet residential street.  HOMES are small, two story affairs, close together, each very much like its neighbor, some with tiny yards fenced in by brick walls. 
Welles' Ford comes slowly down the street.  CHILDREN in school uniforms are heading off for the day in groups. 
Welles parallel parks. 
IN THE CAR 
Welles turns off the engine. He's watching a HOUSE on the other side of the street.  The house is brick on the bottom, aluminum siding on top, quaint, with brick staircase from the front door down to a GARAGE underneath, plastic PINK FLAMINGOS on the small lawn. 
Cars pass in the street.  Welles watches school children pass on the near sidewalk.  He slumps down a little in his seat, adjusting the rearview mirror, adjusting his side mirror, rolling up the window. 
Welles takes a cautionary look around, takes out his gun, pours bullets out and pockets them.  He picks up a PAPER BAG off the passenger seat and opens it. 
He takes out a long, thin metal FILE, pulling off the shrink wrap packaging, feels the file with his thumb. 
Keeping his open gun low under the steering wheel, Welles slides the file into the barrel, scraping gently all along the gun's inner barrel. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT.  WELLES' CAR -- LATER DAY 
Welles sits smoking a cigarette, watching the quaint house. He looks in his side mirror... 
There's a large CAR coming down the block with its turn signal on.  Welles slumps a little lower. 
The car passes, slowing.  The GARAGE DOOR of the quaint house begins to open. 
Welles watches... Can't really see the driver of the car except for the back of his head, but he's huge.  It's a good bet it's Machine. Beside him in the passenger seat is a GREY HAIRED OLD WOMAN. 
The car pulls into the darkness of the quaint house's garage.  After a moment, the OLD WOMAN comes from the garage, walks with a cane, wears glasses.  She goes to the sidewalk, checks her MAILBOX, finds it empty. 
Welles watches. 
The old woman goes back to the garage.  She goes inside. The garage door closes behind her. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT.  WELLES' CAR -- NIGHT 
Welles still watches the house.  There's a light on in one of the second floor windows, curtains closed. 
Welles yawns, shaking his head, trying to stay awake. 
At the quaint house, a light comes on in the front picture window.  Looks like a living room or dining room.  The old woman comes to sit at a table. 
Welles takes binoculars off the front seat... 
THROUGH BINOCULARS 
The old woman says something to someone we cannot see. She's at the dinner table, with a place setting in front of her.  After a moment, someone joins her... 
It's Machine, you can tell by his bulk, by his huge forearms.  The lacy curtains of the window block part of our view, so we never see his face. 
IN THE CAR 
Welles lowers the binoculars, still watching. 
Through the window across the street, Machine can be seen putting a plate of food in front of the old woman.  The old woman smiles up at him, says something. 
Machine goes to light two candles on the table with matches, then goes back to stand beside the old woman. 
Machine is seen from behind, bends to give the old woman a kiss on the cheek, then leaves the room.  The old woman starts to eat. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY 
Dawn light is just breaking.  Welles has fallen asleep, slumped low behind the wheel, snoring lightly. 
Welles awakens with a start, looking around, confused.  He calms, rubbing his eyes, wiping sweat from his features. 
ACROSS THE STREET 
The quaint house's garage door begins to rise. 
IN THE CAR 
Welles sees this, keeps low, watching... The big car backs out into the street.  The old woman's behind the wheel, wearing a hat, driving away, alone. 
Welles watches the car head away in the rear view mirror. 
ON THE STREET 
Welles gets out of his car, shuts the door quietly behind him.  He starts walking towards the quaint house, looks all directions, making sure no one's around. 
Ahead, the garage door begins to close. 
Welles picks up the pace, trying not to look too conspicuous.  The garage door's halfway down... 
Welles runs towards the garage, has to dive and roll to get there, but he makes it under the door just as it closes. 
ABOVE 
In ONE WINDOW of the quaint house, an eyeball is peering out from lacy curtains, then moves away and curtains fall shut. 
INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, GARAGE -- DAY 
Welles gets up, takes out his gun, brushing off. The garage is dark, full of BOXES and JUNK.  Welles moves towards the door to the house. 
INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY 
Machine, in T-shirt and jeans, seen only from behind, comes to a DRESSER and opens a bottom drawer.  His huge hands push clothing aside, digging deep to the bottom of the drawer, taking out the WRESTLING MASK. 
Machine throws the chair, runs, leaps... Machine lands on the table, crawls to the far edge, GRABBING down with his meaty fists as Welles moves forward... 
Under the table, Welles jerks back, avoiding, then rises, extending his knees, PUSHING upwards from underneath... 
Welles FLIPS the table, throwing Machine to the floor... 
Welles charges towards the kitchen door, falls, gets up... Machine gets to his feet... 
IN THE KITCHEN 
Welles SHOVES through the swinging door... Machine BURSTS through, catching Welles, TACKLING him... 
Welles hits the floor with Machine on top.  Machine begins to rein PUNCHES down on Welles, head and back... 
Welles tries to cover up, taking a real beating... 
Machine rises, gripping Welles, LIFTING him, THROWS him... 
Welles SMASHES into shelves of knick-knacks over the kitchen sink, SHATTERING a WINDOW, landing on the sink and counter. 
Machine comes to grip Welles again, drags him across the counter, KNOCKING EVERYTHING to the floor... Machine SWINGS Welles, releases him... 
Welles SLAMS the refrigerator and slumps to the ground, tries to stay conscious, trying weakly to get back up... Machine comes to Welles, gets on his knees... 
Machine wraps his arm around Welles' neck from behind, gets him in a CHOKE HOLD, tightens his grip, cutting off Welles airway with his forearm... 
Welles tries to break Machine's impossible grip with one hand, begins searching the floor with his other hand... frantically feeling for anything he can use... 
Welles' face is blood red... 
Welles' hand grasps desperately... finds a FORK, grips it... 
Welles SWINGS the fork back, STABS it into Machine's thigh! 
Machine SCREAMS, releases Welles and falls back, reaching around to the fork... 
Welles gets to his knees, sucking air, turns to look... 
Machine crawls away, pulls the fork out with trembling fingers.  Beyond him, there's the BASEMENT DOOR. 
Welles gets to his feet, looking... He grabs a FRYING PAN off the counter, gripping it in both hands and moving towards Machine... 
Machine's getting up... Welles BASHES Machine in the face with an upward swing of the frying pan... 
Machine is sent backpedaling, CRASHING into the oven! 
Welles drops the pan, leaps over Machine, to the door... 
IN THE BASEMENT 
Welles comes down the stairs, falls when he gets to the bottom, barely has any strength left.  He looks all directions, sees the LAUNDRY CHUTE in the ceiling... 
Welles gets up, stumbling, falls to his knees at the PILE of dirty LAUNDRY, starts digging through it, searching desperately, throwing clothing aside... 
Behind, Machine comes down the stairs, a bloody mess... 
Welles searches the laundry pile... 
Machine reaches the bottom of the stairs, heading for Welles.  Welles turns, has the GUN in hand, FIRES TWICE... HITTING Machine in the shoulder and stomach, knocking Machine a few steps backwards... 
Welles FIRES... 
Machine's HIT in the CHEST, falling back, into hanging laundry, pulling down the clothes line and sheets... 
Machine hits the ground, wrapped in sheets. 
Welles stands, still aiming the gun, pulls the trigger on an empty chamber.  Out of bullets. 
Machine's trying to pull free from the sheets, trying to get back up to his feet.  Welles lets out a sob, drops the gun, walking to Machine... 
Welles climbs onto Machine from behind, takes clothing line in hand, starts wrapping the cord around Machine's throat... 
Welles pulls back on the clothes line, pulling it tight... 
Machine tries to get his fingers around the cord.  Welles stands, pulling tighter, putting a foot on Machine's back, pulling the clothes line with all his might... 
The cord's cutting into Welles' hand, drawing blood. 
Machine, face down, lets out a gurgling sound, struggling, struggling... till he finally stops moving. 
Welles releases the cord, takes a step back, breathing hard, trembling.  He looks around the basement. 
Welles walks to pick up his gun, replaces the gun in his holster.  He stands looking at Machine. 
Welles walks to Machine, bends, grasps Machine wrestling mask, pulling it off.  He rolls Machine over... 
Welles stares down at Machine.  We never see Machine's face. 
INT.  KITCHEN -- DAY 
Welles comes up from the basement, slow, hurting.  He looks around at the damage done, looks down to see he's still holding Machine's mask.  He drops it. 
EXT.  QUAINT HOUSE -- DAY 
Welles crosses the street, going to his car.  He gets into his car, starts it, pulls out and drives away. 
EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE -- DAY 
BIRDS SING.  KIDS are kicking around a soccer ball down the street.  Welles' Ford arrives, pulls into the driveway. 
INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY -- DAY 
Welles comes in the front door, still a horrible mess. 
WELLES Hello?!  Amy?

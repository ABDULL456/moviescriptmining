1   INT. HILLSIDE VILLA - MORNING                                 1 
Stare at my broken face in a gilded mirror. The breaks occurred a lifetime ago, healed uneven. I wear a white tropical button-down, a Republican-gold Rolex, a pirate-patch over what was my left eye. 
ME (V.O.) I'm old. And all I have left is the will to remember... 
I reach into a dresser drawer, pull out a yellowed black & white picture of HER: this beatific blonde, sleeping. Below me is a week-old L.A. Times with the headline: Matriarch of Television Series, Empire Ridge, Retires. 
The Matriarch's picture in the middle.                            * 
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...and the fear I'll forget... 
Slide HER over the Matriarch's picture: the Matriarch 30 years younger now. Lift my eyes back to my reflection. 
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) I killed innocent men. I betrayed sacred oaths. I reaped profit from horror. The names are dead or too guilty to tell. The events so brutal they beg to be re-told... 
Legend: Los Angeles, Fall 1958 
2   INT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - FIGHT NIGHT                         2 
The battered face of an Irish Pug. Same guy? No. A hard jab bashes the Pug out of frame. And there I am: next to the `Ring' Magazine Reporter chewing the ass out of his cigar. 
ME (V.O.) Lieutenant Dave Klein, Vice Division. LAPD. That's what my face looked like before. 
My point of view now: Irish Pug on the business end of this bantam Black's combos. Standing to my left: SERGEANT RICHARD "JUNIOR" STEMMONS. Twenty-six. 
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) Junior Stemmons. A partner I never asked for. The scowl meant to hide a shit-scared kid who'd been teaching evidence classes three months ago. His Old-Man was an LAPD lifer who never got past Sergeant. 
JUNIOR STEMMONS We should make our move now. 
ME Mid-fight? Look at the crowd: you wanna be at the center of a riot? 
JUNIOR STEMMONS I don't wanna be here when Noonan and the Feds show up. 
I point at the bantam Black: 
ME We let Sanderline finish this beating, we get his gratitude.                          * 
Junior eyes the exits clockwise, nervous, waiting for `Untouchables' to break the doors down. I hate the way panic smells when I stand this close to it. 
JUNIOR STEMMONS We gonna let Rock-a-bye fight too- 
ME -relax Junior. 
3   INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                              3 
The Bantam Black: SANDERLINE JOHNSON. Led through the double doors. He sees me, then his gaze shifts to Junior popping jabs inches from REUBEN RUIZ: a muscled middle-weight, fight- taped hands cuffed behind his back. I smile big: 
ME Sanderline, I'm Lieutenant Klein of the LAPD and a real big fan- 
JUNIOR STEMMONS -you're under arrest. 
Sanderline spooks, steps back. Turn and make sure Junior sees the fire in my eyes, keep staring at Junior as I speak to Sanderline again: 
ME No you're not. Reuben is- 
REUBEN RUIZ -Lieutenant Dave why you arrest- 
ME -for being a ranked fighter who still steals hubcaps. Shut up. (off Ruiz, back to Sanderline) If I was gonna arrest you, I wouldn't have let you finish: and that hook-uppercut combo you got is something special. (from Reuben, beat) Reuben's in custody. But you could be our Guest. Whaddya say? 
4   EXT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - MOMENT LATER                        4 
Me, Junior, Reuben, and Sanderline aim for the nearest exit. Behind the stands. Reuben and Sanderline in street clothes, hats pulled down tight. Feature the Announcer: 
RING ANNOUNCER Ladies and Gentleman...due to circumstances beyond our control, Rock-A-Bye Ruiz will not fight this- 
-BOOS drown the PA. Beer and lit cigars shell the Announcer. Fights erupt in the stands. I can't stifle a chuckle. Three exits down: day late-dollar short Feds. WELLES NOONAN, elbows- out, surveying the scene like a half-assed Rommel. 
ME (V.O.) Welles Noonan, US Attorney. Ivy League Crimefighter. Launching a big boxing probe as a way to begin prying into everything else crooked and corrupt in LA. 
Move faster. 
UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.) Me and Sam G. 
ME (V.O.) G for `Giancana.' I owe him favors for the rest of my life. 
UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.) We're out at the place in Palm Springs. You should come out for the weekend. 
ME Tell Sam if I get minute- 
UNIDENTIFIED VOICE -yer gonna have to make a minute for him. Now. See, we think the Spade might testify that Sam owns him and how we was grooming him for a title shot he was gonna tank. A fight everybody woulda' got flush off of, including the Spade.                        * (beat, quieter) Have him look out the window Klein. 
Click. A breath. Drop the phone on the cradle...step to the window...open it...then I chuckle genuine: 
ME Sanderline, you gotta see this... 
Trusting puppy Sanderline steps to the window: 
SANDERLINE JOHNSON What'm I- 
-smash his head against the frame using his forward motion. He loses muscle control for the split-second it takes me to pitch his legs up and out. My face a quick-change evil mask. 
Feature Sanderline's nine-story fall. That Ambassador Hotel robe billows behind him like a cape. He detonates an overhead streetlight with a bomb sound, then hits the driveway. 
Unzip my fly, hustle into the bathroom, screams from outside now. Flush the toilet as Junior and Ruiz pile through the door. Step out, play it baffled: look at the bed where Sanderline sat, then the open window, screams floating up... 
ME DID THAT MUTT JUST JUMP? 
Lunge to the window: Sanderline post-mortem. Head shattered. Valets sprinting. Junior on the phone. Ruiz steps-up next to me: horrified. I keep staring at the smashed body...whisper: 
ME (CONT'D) Remember where you live. 
Reuben has to use both hands to steady himself. 
6   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - BRADLEY'S OFFICE - MORNING           6 
Spartan space appointed with high-ticket items like the mahogany table around which we sit. Outside: echoes of a protest filter through the windows: 
MUFFLED PROTEST AMALGAM (O.C.) MEXICAN BROTHERS SI! IMPERIAL DODGERS NO! 
Four of us at the table glued to the T.V, watching U.S. Attorney Welles Noonan lambasting the LAPD. 
ME (V.O.) LA's version of the Young Turks, only meaner. (MORE) 
ME (V.O.) (cont'd) Boyce Bradley, Chief of Detectives. Smartest man in town. And one of the richest: Dad was a Real Estate Developer who owned a strip of land that's now known as the Santa Monica Freeway. On either side, Bradley's book-ends: D.A. Bob Gallaudet, not the smartest man in town: `Gas Chamber' Bob cribbed my notes at USC Law. And Tom Bethune, running for a City Council seat that'll decide if this Mexican slum called Chavez Ravine gets bulldozed and renamed `Dodger Stadium.'              * 
BRADLEY Turn it off. 
Bethune leaps like a lapdog, hits the power. 
ME I was pissing. He was jumping. 
Bradley picks up a newspaper: 
BRADLEY `US Attorney Noonan is accusing the Los Angeles Police Department in general, and Lt. David Klein in particular, of murder at worst, gross incompetence at best...' 
ME Noonan had Sanderline scared. After he sang to me he panicked & jumped. 
TOM BETHUNE He did spend a month in Camarillo Mental Hospital last year- 
GAS CHAMBER BOB -and wearing that hotel robe over his clothes makes him look even more looney-bin. 
TOM BETHUNE Plus, Reuben Ruiz recanted. So Noonan's Boxing Probe is dead. He's got nothing- 
BRADLEY -but time, a mandate and new targets...I need to speak to the Lieutenant alone. 
Bob and Tom nod, pat my back on the way out: proud uncles lending support before Dad drops the hammer. Door closes. I stand, step to the window, big Pro-Mex protest below: Geeks and placards: `BASEBALL IS AS AMERICAN AS THE TRAIL OF TEARS! 
BRADLEY (CONT'D) Describe to me your duty, as you understood it, regarding Sanderline Johnson and Reuben Ruiz. 
ME Take both men into custody before Noonan and the Feds could, and find                   * out what they were going to tell- 
BRADLEY -and why did I choose you for this? 
ME Because I'm a Cop with a law degree, and you thought my legal- 
BRADLEY -because your a thug with a law degree. Because I thought by now you'd be so indebted to this Department for not indicting and/or                   * imprisoning you, that diligent, honest discharge of duty would be assured. (beat) And I made a horrible misjudgment.                    * 
ME Bethune and Gallaudet don't think so. 
BRADLEY Bob's happy because he wants to be State Attorney General and his most likely opponent will be Welles Noonan. Tom's happy because Morton Diskant, who's leading their City Council race, is endorsed by Noonan. Thus, they're not seeing the larger play. (with calculated emphasis) Noonan's new target will likely be the LAPD itself. 
ME How do you know that? 
ME What would Mom and Dad say? 
ME Nothing. That's where I learned it. 
She stands, goes to the stove. 
MEG Poor you. 
ME Yeah, pour me...a cup please. Black, no sugar. 
Meg stares darts. I smile to defuse. 
ME (CONT'D) Pretty please. 
She fetches cups and saucers. 
ME (CONT'D) How's work?                                             * 
MEG It's work. 
ME How's Pete? 
MEG More work. 
Quiet while we wait for the pot...and quiet always means creeping sleep: an Enemy I never stop fighting. Force my eyes open, shift in my seat: I've been exhausted for years. 
I drift despite my best efforts and for a split second you see the Hell I see when sleep wins: 
10   INT./EXT. NIGHTMARE                                          10 
Fire where the clouds should be -- POP -- in a backseat, point-blank Tommy-gunning two smiling men -- POP -- Marine fatigues soaked in blood, plunging my bayonet into a cheesecake-white belly -- POP -- that beautiful blonde from       * the Olympic, smiling -- POP-                                      * 
11   INT. WESTWOOD COTTAGE - SAME MOMENT                          11 
-awake. My leg jerks, kicks a big Wing-Tip. A cup of coffee pipes in front of me. Then voices. I turn: PETE BONDURANT has his hands on my sister's shoulders. 
ME (V.O.) Big Pete Bondurant. One-time LA Sheriff. Bounced when he beat-dead a Prisoner who spit at him. A duly impressed Howard Hughes hired him on as his full-time muscle. My Sister's new Hump. My oldest living Friend. 
PETE (turns back at me) You look like Death taking a shit. 
Meg cackles. 
MEG He's still got that MGM-face. 
PETE You're still the only guy who ever traded movie-potential for Police work. 
MEG Because in the movies they make you pull your punches. 
Drain my mug. To Pete: 
ME Wanna do LAPD a favor tonight? 
MEG No. We're going to the Cocoanut- 
-Pete puts an extended index finger in front of Meg's lips, which she bends backwards. 
PETE 'Favor' mean `free?' 
ME Means $500 an hour. 
MEG Gimme the phone so I can find another Date- 
ME -you're the only Woman I know who calls Men- 
MEG -you're the only Man I know who doesn't call Women. 
Pete laughs, then:                                             * 
PETE What are we doing? 
12   EXT. LOW RENT OFFICE BUILDING, EAST LA - NIGHT            12 
Me and Junior in the car. Pete street-side, tucked into the shadows -- mimes jacking off, checks his watch. Everybody bored. Glance again at the file in my lap: 
ME (V.O.) Morton Diskant, a man who preferred migrant workers to million dollar ballparks. Beating Bethune in their City Council Race despite getting outspent 10 to 1. (beat) If he wins, the Dodgers don't get a Stadium, Mexicans get to keep raising chickens two miles from City Hall and Bradley makes sure I                   * burn for Sanderline Johnson.                         * 
Junior in the backseat, penning in a steno, mouthing something to himself. 
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) Junior brought along because he begged. Already hip to how many ways you can make money with a badge. 
JUNIOR STEMMONS You got a birthday coming up. 
ME -and maybe salvage something that's a close cousin to `respect.' But what about your wife and kid getting hold of those pictures? 
Wait for the big futile scream/struggle. Keep waiting. Diskant just sits. No words. And now I wish he'd cry, throw punches, anything...but he doesn't. I turn to Junior: 
ME (CONT'D) Take the Quiff home. 
QUIFF My name's Franklin- 
ME -of course it is. 
Junior pulls Quiff out the door. By his hand. Just Pete, Me, and Diskant now. Silent moments drag sour... 
ME (CONT'D) I need a nod from you Morton, let's me know you get it- 
DISKANT -don't say my name... 
PETE He gets it. 
ME Someone from the Times will call for a quote. Whatever your reason for dropping out make it real. 
As Pete and I turn to leave: 
DISKANT (not looking at us) You eventually lose the ability to reconcile the things you've done to people. That's Hell. 
A long moment on me and Pete. Blunted by what we just heard. 
14   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - NEXT MOMENT                        14 
Pete driving. Silence. Tune to an all-night Jazz signal, turn up the volume loud enough to jumble doubts. Toss Pete his cut. A $500 roll. 
PETE (pocketing the money) Y'know Hughes has a job you're tailor-made for. I already gave him your- 
ME -no thanks. 
PETE Stop pretending you're not a pig for all this, Klein. 
ME I still got a day job, Pete- 
PETE -tossing more Bantamweights out                       * windows? 
I wait too long, answer in too high a voice: 
ME The Mutt jumped. 
PETE (laughs small, then:) Not even the people who don't know you believe that. If somebody from the DA's office decides to dig, you could fry Boy-o. Be nice to be in with a billionaire who's got a fleet of planes, fly you outta the country on a moment's notice. (beat) C'mon -- it's a cake legal gig. He                    * just wants you to burn some actress that stopped fucking him. 
Stop in front of Meg's place. Pete leaves the engine running, jumps out. 
PETE (CONT'D) Tomorrow. Hughes Aircraft, 7pm                        * It'll be worth it. 
I watch Pete go into Meg's place. Drive on. Stop sign. A block away: Black Buick parallel to me. Exhaust plumes. Like they're waiting. I keep my eyes on the rear-view as I pass...but it just stays put...idling. 
15   INT. MY HOME, HOLLYWOOD HILLS - MOMENTS LATER             15 
Lights off but something grabs my eye instantly. Kitchen table: a manila envelope. 100 $100-bills. USC season tickets. A note: `Thanks for proving Flying Monkeys only live in Oz. Sam G.' Exhale. Flip to the same jazz station. Sit. Start another futile fight with sleep. 
The last thing I see before I nod black: my War Trophy, a Japanese Officer's Samurai Sword mounted on my mantle. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
16   INT./EXT. NIGHTMARE                                            16 
Artillery barrages from Hell: Okinawa, 1945. A hate-fueled frenzy hacking up half-starved Jap Soldiers. They dive off the Cliffs to escape me: this massive, gray-eyed Marine. 
I dive after them. Bombing toward a world below already ablaze. Falling. Gaining on a figure in a bathrobe. This guttural scream turns mechanical, like a ring as I recognize Sanderline Johnson: his pieced-together face smiling up. Snap awake. My phone ringing. 1 AM. Rip the phone from the wall:         * 
ME (CONT'D) Klein- 
BRADLEY (O.S.) -you know who Hector Magdalena is? 
ME (as cobwebs clear) ...yeah...Narco's Snitch. 
BRADLEY (O.S.) He's missing. His home was broken into at some point within the last hour. 
ME So send Robbery. 
BRADLEY (O.C.) The only thing taken was him. Wilshire Station is on-scene. Get over there right now. 
ME Why me? 
BRADLEY Call it penance. 
BIDDIE Bushes. Spyin' on Lucille. Seen him                   * there before! He's a black saboteur                   * looking for fertile white wombs. Wanna breed a mulatto master race-                    * 
-cut into the crazy: 
ME Officer. 
The Six-Pack crosses to confer. 
ME (CONT'D) Besides bat-shit insanity, is there anything else about her that rings true? 
OFFICER Heard an argument, loud, maybe a minute or two, then silence. 
ME What's this `Peeper' riff she's on? 
OFFICER She saw someone in the bushes earlier. She's reported that kind of thing a dozen other times. She's also reported flying saucers, so... 
ME See if any of the other Neighbors can verify this `Peeper' thing.                       * 
Roam. A hallway. Junior the grim-faced professional, He's got that damn steno out, scribbling like he's on a deadline. 
JUNIOR STEMMONS No one touch a thing `til I say. 
He's hovering over a lake of blood, drag marks originating in that lake lead out to the garage. Junior sees me. See him startle, then jut his tough-guy chin on reflex: 
JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D) Dave- 
ME -Lieutenant Klein. I said `meet me' in twenty minutes' not `go in without me.' 
JUNIOR STEMMONS All I've been doing- 
ME (hard/harsh/low) -is stepping on dicks. You don't know the history, the players or the play. 
Pull Junior aside, impart the following tightly: 
ME (CONT'D) The Department gave Magdalena a                      * monopoly on the LA dope trade decades ago- 
JUNIOR STEMMONS -what Department? 
ME Us Pollyanna -- LAPD. We bullet- proofed him in exchange for 60% of his profit and a promise he only deal drugs in Darktown and East LA-                  * 
JUNIOR STEMMONS -Black and Mexican- 
ME -give the man a prize. He'd also                     * rat his competition and kill the ones we couldn't convict. Now keep your mouth shut and stay on my hip. 
JUNIOR STEMMONS                            * Fine.                                                * 
I want to bounce his head off the wall. I continue my tour instead. Follow the blood-trail out into the garage where it   * ends in another smaller lake of blood. 
JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)                   * Loaded him into a car- 
ME -are all the Magdalena vehicles accounted for? 
JUNIOR STEMMONS Except for the Son's: Tommy.                         * 
Continue the tour. Kitchen. Two Dobermans, shot dead. Feature matching bullet wounds right between their eyes -- yell to      * the Officer with the Biddie:                                    * 
ME OFFICER. 
As he pokes his head around the corner: 
ME (CONT'D) The old lady hear dogs barking?                       * Gunshots? 
OFFICER No, I asked. Just the yelling. 
Examine the wounds closer. Catch myself petting the deceased pooches. To Junior: 
ME She didn't hear barking...so they were either lousy guard dogs...or they knew the Killer. (point to the wounds) You can't hit something this clean unless you're point blank. He could've been petting them when he fired: look at the burn pattern-                      * (point) Like when you shoot something with a silencer. 
JUNIOR STEMMONS How do you know that? 
ME (stare so he gets it) I've shot things with silencers... And the old lady didn't hear any                      * gunshots. 
JUNIOR STEMMONS You make a family member for it? Tommy? 
ME Maybe...                                              * 
JUNIOR STEMMONS Do you want to issue an APB? 
ME I want to talk to Bradley first. Where are the Mother and Daughter?                   * 
19   INT. FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             19 
BARTENDER Sanderline Johnson was my second                      * cousin, Peckerwood. I wouldn't                        * drink that with my gun hand. 
He vanishes behind a stained curtain. Feel those voodoo         * stares from behind...and I switch the scotch glass to my left   * hand as nonchalant as possible. Bartender reappears, motions me back. I follow. Backstage. I see a figure stretched prone, ice-pack pressed to his face, rolled reefer between his lips. 
ME (V.O.) Lester Lake. One-time velvet voiced crooner. But a dabble in the dope trade cost him a set of slashed vocal cords at the hands of none                      * other than Hector Magdalena.                          * 
Only as I get closer do I see the badly swollen black eye. He looks up at me. A voice like sand-paper left out in the sun:    * 
LESTER LAKE Lieutenant Dave Klein. Slayer of                      * Sanderline Johnson...y'got stones                     * showing up this far South.                            * 
ME What happened to your face? 
LESTER LAKE (beat) Tommy Mag wanted to make sure I understood something he was saying. 
ME Where is he? 
LESTER LAKE Left an hour ago. Emptied my safe. 
ME Shit. He's wise. 
LESTER LAKE To what? You looking for him? 
Lester hands me the reefer, take it, toke geeky, belch smoke. 
ME (at the reefer) Just never got this... 
Lester takes it back, draws deep. 
LESTER LAKE Too white to appreciate good grass.                   * 
Now watch Lester's attitude improve toot sweet: 
ME Hector Magdalena is missing, presumed dead. Tommy is our sole suspect. 
He spurts smoke, sits up like a shot, beams.                    * 
LESTER LAKE Muthafucker -- there is a God. If only I'd known this an hour ago. 
ME Heartbreaker, huh? You let him gig here last night? 
LESTER LAKE I don't let him, he just does. Nails on a chalkboard too. He rushed the stage last week when we had Charlie Mingus drop in for a set. Mingus looked at this half-Mex                   * greaser kid trying to play `Round                     * Midnight,' said that fool couldn't                    * find them keys with a flashlight.' 
ME Tommy's playing days are over. 
LESTER LAKE Hallelujah. 
ME What time did he show up? 
LESTER LAKE Around four. Him and these Pachucos         * poppin' switchblades like punks. (mops his brow of blood) The only thing that was keepin' him         * `untouched' was Hector...                   * (beat, hopeful-prayer) Is he really dead?                          * 
ME There's blood all over his house, seems to belong to him. There's just no body. Not yet. 
LESTER LAKE (a toke, a thought) I don't feature Tommy for it.               * 
ME (my head kinks a bit)                   * How's that? How many times has he           * been in here, busted you up? 
LESTER LAKE Yeah, but he ain't got the salt             * to truly take a Man's life.                 * Especially not Hector's...he was            * scared of him.                              * 
ME                                * Why?                                        * 
LESTER LAKE                       * `Cuz Hector been whippin' Tommy's           * ass from the time he could talk.            * 
ME                                * What about the Wife? Beat her too?          * 
LESTER LAKE                       * We used to call that old bitch `the         * Burglar'...eyes were so black, it           * looked like she had a mask on.              * 
ME                                * And the daughter? Lucille?                  * 
Lester can't quip that one as quick. Tokes. Shaking his head.   * 
LESTER LAKE                                 * Things up off the street. Rumors.                     * 
ME                                       * Like?                                                 * 
LESTER LAKE                                 * Hector had turned her out. Using                      * her the way the Romans used to use                    * their daughters when they did                         * business: Some pussy to sweeten the                   * pot. Rumor was she got picked up in                   * this trick sweep few weeks back.                      * 
ME                                          * Hector was whoring her?                               * 
LESTER LAKE                                 * Hector was an evil Muthafucker.                       * 
...Lester tilts his neck back, points to a long keloid scar     * that stretches across his throat...                             * 
BRADLEY -no. We can't risk that. Do you             * make him for the murderer? 
ME Yeah. Hector's disappearance is definitely an inside job. That whole family feels hinky. The daughter was all bruises and no tears and Hector's hop-head wife            * looks part punching bag. 
BRADLEY Do you suspect either of the women?         * 
ME According to Wilhite, they were in Santa Barbara at the time. 
BRADLEY Verify that. Where is your partner? 
ME Vouching in evidence at Wilshire Station. 
BRADLEY Keep him on that. He had excellent ratings as an evidence teacher and          * I trust him more than you. (beat) Find Tommy Magdalena. Focus everything on that effort & I want him apprehended Klein, not killed. 
ME What about Hector? Still missing. 
BRADLEY And most likely dead. Find the Son.         * Stakeout the residence. Put tails on both the mother and daughter -- I want this investigation working quietly, and around the clock. 
ME                                * And what do we do if Hector turns           * up?                                         * 
BRADLEY                                    * If he's alive, bring him to me. If he's dead, have him John Doe'd at                    * the morgue until Noonan can be                       * drawn off and this FBI situation                     * sorted out.                                          * 
ME Wilhite. He was operating Hector- 
BRADLEY -don't worry about Dan Wilhite. You deal directly with me. Now go out the back. I don't want the press recognizing you. 
Swallow my sneer. Push through the service doors. Hard. Headed back toward the kitchen, an exit sign. I pass an alcove: Her. Alone. Smoke break. Beauty you almost never get to examine up close. I stop, stammer, she gives me a once- over, thinks I'm a Reporter... 
ME You got a light? 
WOMAN (searches my empty hands) You got a cigarette? 
I fumble for a Chesterfield. She pulls a Zippo slow. 
WOMAN (CONT'D) If you snap a picture of me, I get to set you on fire. Fair? 
I smile too wide -- fuck. I kill it, try to gather up the bits of `cool' that shattered with the sophomore smile. 
ME It didn't look like you were all that upset with the attention. 
WOMAN Good thing you're not a cop. 
ME (beat) How's that? 
WOMAN Your power of observation leaves lots to be desired. 
Lights my cigarette. I hold it in my mouth to hide shaking hands. 
ME Thank you. 
WOMAN Don't thank me: these things are bad for you. 
ME You believe everything you read? 
Stubs her cigarette. 
WOMAN You believe anything you read? 
She starts walking back the way I came. 
ME (hail-mary) Do you eat Dinner? 
WOMAN No. 
I can't stop watching her, even after she pushes back through the double doors, re-entering the fray head-first. I step after her. A reporter finally makes me. Random catcalls of `Klein! `Hey, Enforcer!' Shutterbugs beeline my way, firing flashbulbs from the hip. Close the door quick and bolt. 
ME (V.O.) Make a note: steal Bethune's guest-                     * list, then go door-to-door until                        * you find her again. 
24   INT. WILSHIRE STATION - DAY                                  24 
Stroll. Sidelong stares on the periphery. Muted whispers from     * desk cops. Feature this rookie chump clear a path as I pass.      * Down a flight of stairs to the evidence lockers. Junior writes seizure abstracts, sealing materials in green-banded       * evidence bags. A pile stacked neatly on the table next to him. That red steno pad in full view. 
ME This everything from the house? 
A beat. He makes me wait as he finishes writing. 
JUNIOR STEMMONS Everything worthwhile. 
ME What did you tell the Watch Commander upstairs? 
JUNIOR STEMMONS (schoolboy proud) That this was a random drug seizure. I'm not using names and I'm number coding everything. A load of interesting stuff too. (points to each stack) I got unregistered fire-arms, more dope than I've ever seen, and some mail from business associates that seems hinky. We should follow up-           * (grabs an envelope)                     * -here, this one, `Hurwitz Holdings'         * Hector had some real estate dealings- 
ME For 10 give it any name you want. I'm a salaried employee of LAPD,                      * that means I'll have to find time off hours to do this. 
A long, cold moment drags...                                    * 
MILTEER Agreed. Start tonight. Someone's                      * been stealing groceries from our talent domiciles. There's no proof that it's her, but it's her. Peter will provide you addresses. 
ME (faux fey) Thank you Peter. 
MILTEER We look forward to your updates. 
27   INT. PAY PHONE ON SEPULVEDA - LATE AFTERNOON              27 
Dialing the Station: 
ME Sergeant, pass a message to Stemmons: I want him to meet me at the one-thousand block of South Tremaine tonight at 11 and at some point between now and then, I'll need him to do a preliminary work- up on a woman named Glenda Bledsoe. (beat, check spelling) B-L-E-D-S-O-E. Thanks. 
I hang up, step out, yawn. 
28   EXT. ATOMIC VAMPIRE SET - DUSK                            28 
Two-fisting coffees. On top of a hill overlooking the `Atomic Vampires' shoot. Pure schlock. The spaceship: a totaled Cadillac replete with home-made canopy and cardboard extensions on the fins. Crew: homeless winos. Extras: homeless drug-fiends. Scan the assembled `talent'...and see: 
HER. My black and white picture. The Beauty at the fight. The starlet I threw a Hail Mary dinner pass to at Bethune's victory party: GLENDA BLEDSOE. Emerging from a small trailer. 
ME (V.O.) Twice in a day doesn't happen. Not in a city like LA. Not like this. (beat) This is fate. This is Cupid firing his whole fucking quiver. Move. Make sure she's real. 
HER laughing. Melodic. I hike down through the bramble. 
29   EXT. ATOMIC VAMPIRE SET - DUSK                               29 
Walk past a pair of beat Airstream Clippers. Watch her propping up this silver-haired junkie. She grabs a sound blanket, drapes him, hands him her coffee before siting down next to another Woman and rehearsing. 
I eyeball the rest of the `set.' Winos in werewolf masks and capes, holding wooden ray-guns spray-painted silver: One pisses, bottle in one hand, cigarette/dick in the other. 
The "Director" is a fey manic, fingering a snuff-box. 
DIRECTOR This is the big Armada landing, so I need everybody's energy up, up up! Where's my Alien Commander? 
The Pissing WEREWOLF careens back to set, pulling at his zipper, mask askew, covering his eyes. 
WEREWOLF RIGHT HERE GOD DAMN IT. 
MICKEY COHEN, 62, former mob boss. He boils eggs on a hot- plate and slings hash to extras lining plywood picnic tables. 
ME (V.O.) Mickey Cohen: one-time LA crime kingpin and West Coast Mob heavy who now trawls for loose change. 
Winos vibe LAPD, make a hole as I approach: 
ME (CONT'D) Cecil B. Demoted. 
MICKEY COHEN Where Klein goes tsuris follows. This is what I hate about being down, lip from the likes of you. 
ME If this is `down' I never want to see `out.' How the mighty have fallen. 
MICKEY COHEN (gives it right back) Which one of us are you talking about Klein? Word is the Federal Bureau is all hot and bothered with you Gonif. Hey, I hear J. Edgar schtups his personal assistant and makes him wear ladies hose. 
ME What else are you hearing? 
MICKEY COHEN That this Welles Noonan character has developed quite a crush. That you might want to consider relocating to Dogdick, Delaware. 
ME Been a marked man for years Mick. 
MICKEY COHEN But the bullseye on your back's never been quite so big...if you need a new line of work, I got this faygele leading man needs replacing- 
-follow Mickey's gaze over to ROCK ROCKWELL. Buff McMan Meat-   * the guy with Glenda at the Bethune party. He's primping with    * other boys decked in surplus SS uniforms, checking the side     * mirror of one of the `Alien craft' before his big close-up.     * 
MICKEY COHEN His agent told me he could play straight. 
ME                                          * His agent lied.                                       * 
MICKEY COHEN                                * You interested?                                       * 
ME No. But I am interested in your                       * leading lady. Bradley sent me. Saw                    * her at the Bethune- 
MICKEY COHEN -not a chance. I'm still trying to play hide the submarine. 
ME You want Chief Bradley angry? 
MICKEY COHEN Ten years ago I could call for that                   * little Pisher's head on a stick. (looks around) And now... 
ME And now the only thing you're putting on sticks are corn dogs. What's her name, Mick? 
ME Seltzer will take the blood out. 
Junior bitchy, like some broad you stood up: 
JUNIOR STEMMONS I give you the shirt off my back                        * and you bash me!                                        * 
ME When a Superior Officer tells you to leave the room, you leave the                        * fucking room.                                           * 
Junior balls the shirt, stuffs it in his desk drawer. Takes a     * deep breath.                                                      * 
JUNIOR STEMMONS I made a file on the Bledsoe broad. The one you asked about. 
ME Thanks. But forget it. 
JUNIOR STEMMONS I spent a whole day putting it together and this skirt's got skeletons. 
Reminded, glance at my hand: "A I N G E" in smeared ink. Junior rips open a file, blathers Bledsoe preliminaries: 
JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D) Shoplifting in Bakersfield at 17. Prostitution arrest at 21. Known associate of a Kern County homicide victim, this convicted pimp named Dwight Gillette, probably her pimp. Stabbed to death in his home, weapon never recovered- 
ME Forget it. Burn it, s'not important now. 
Take the file from him, flip through; thorough, detailed. Glenda priors scream back instant conviction. 
JUNIOR STEMMONS Why is it not important? 
Plant the file in his chest as my answer. 
ME I need an address on a guy named Ainge, George Ainge-                                    * 
JUNIOR STEMMONS -what about Magdalena? 
My temper turning threadbare. 
ME -after you get the Ainge address,                       * get back to the Magda- 
JUNIOR STEMMONS (picks up Glenda's file) -is Ainge related to this Cunt? 
Snap-grit-grab him: buttons from his shirt pop, bounce. 
ME We're partners in name only. You want to stay in the room next time, Junior? Do something to impress me: like finding that address. 
Dig Junior trying to hide tears now behind that mad-dog glare: makes me want to break the bones in his face. 
39   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - MORNING                               39 
Driving, running parallels to avoid Fed tails. No Black Buicks...But a Gray Packard shifts behind me on a cadence.        * 
ME (V.O.) Noonan replaced the Buick with a                        * Packard and a better Shadow-Man.                        * But I could still spot the tail.                        * 
Run a red light at Rossmore, leave the Packard behind.            * 
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) This jet-engine urge to see her. Needing it like a junkie does. No logic. Just the push. 
Driving past Glenda's house now. No Corvette. Driving past      * the Griffith Park `Vampires' set: addicts/crew rolling up sleeping bags. No Corvette. Pull the address list Dandy handed me: Talent Domiciles. 
Pasadena. Howard's Fuck-Pad supreme: A tudor mansion with airplane-shaped hedges. A Corvette in the drive. Stop at the curb. Open shades. Flashes of her. Gathering something. Check my Hamilton, look up as: KNOCK-KNOCK on my window. Her face, inches-close. Bags of groceries in her hands and this wry little smile: watch me kill Hughes's new Dick with kindness.    * 
Roll the window down, stay blank-slate. She features my cuts/bruises. Her quiet, deep voice is like medicine: 
GLENDA BLEDSOE Better looking than the last guy Howard hired. Once you heal. (she recognizes me) Wait a minute. You were there, the other night, the Bethune Party...                     * 
My heart jammed up into my throat. Push past it.                * 
ME Yeah.                                                 * 
GLENDA Mickey told me this `Bent Cop' everybody used to call- (mocking, I love it:) -`The Enforcer' was asking about me. Told me to be careful. So you're LAPD after all... 
ME In theory. 
GLENDA BLEDSOE You're going to arrest me for breaking and entering? 
ME Depends. (nod to groceries) Those Howard's? 
GLENDA BLEDSOE Everything's Howard's. 
ME Except you. 
GLENDA BLEDSOE That's why I left. 
ME You just shop here now? 
Back booth with a view of the street. Bido Lito's across the way. Eyeball the entrance and adjoining alley. On the table in front of me, mugshots: known Tommy Magdalena associates.     * Mostly greaser kids with low-rent juvie sheets.                 * 
Stare at that photo of Tommy. 
ME (V.O.) Stakeout work. Browse mugs. Match a face out front if I get lucky. Wait till Bido Lito's gets busy before I make my move. 
43   INT. DINER - NIGHT (LATER)                                43 
Snub my last Chesterfield, stifle a yawn, check my Hamilton. 9:20 PM. Bito Crowd bops out front. Valet ballet.               * Scanning...spot a face...pull my mugshots...Steve Wenzel,       * Okie white-trash from El Monte, shoving his way through the crush out in front of the club, hits the side alley. 
I'm up. Dump a pocketful of coins on the table. Hit the door. 
44   EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS                                  44 
Cross fast, play the wall and the shadows close. Watch as Wenzel climbs steps to a flop overtop of the club. Get deeper into the alley: a padlocked two-car overhang at the rear. Grip my .45, stock down, swing, split the lock. Chain spools at my feet, slide inside the overhang...a car concealed under a tarpaulin, peel it off slow...revealing a red `32 Ford.       * 
ME (V.O.)                                  * Tommy's Deuce.                                       * 
Pull the pig-sticker off my ankle, stab the Driver-side tire.   * 
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)                            * Now he's on foot.                                       * 
45   INT. SECOND FLOOR FLOP - CONTINUOUS                          45 
Jimmy the door,   slide inside silent. Muffled sounds through the floor, some   jazz combo wailing away at Bido Lito's below. Voices down the   hall, male, laughter, goofball guffaws. George Gobel on   the tube: `Well, I'll be a dirty bird! 
Creep in a crouch, my .45 at the hip, safety off. Move toward the flicker at the far end of the hall. Sounds of pissing         * nearby, ease around a doorjamb .45 first: bedroom barren, dust-caked mattress, a half dozen bottles of Old Crow lie scattered among sash cords & used heroin spikes. 
Light from the bathroom...a pair of legs visible, female. Dark but pale, splayed from inside the bathroom...the right foot slowly moves back and forth like the heel is trying to gain some purchase on fast-draining life. Somebody flushes, zips up, steps over the two legs. 
Duck back into the hall as this Greaser stinking of pomade wafts past, weaving back toward the TV room. 
46   INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS                                    46 
Inside. Move fast now. A fist-sized lump swells mid-chest, blossoms into my throat. I don't want to see what I know is there. Turn the corner: 
Club Alabam songbird Tilly Hopwell. Three breaths from death. A spike snapped off in her greyish, motionless left arm. Her right hand claws at tile. These beautiful dark eyes stare up at me like she was hoping for someone sooner. Throttle marks on her neck, one breast exposed, bra pulled down for a grope. 
I don't want to touch her face but I do...she closes her eyes the moment my fingertips hit. That gases my hate. Choke back sudden tears. 
VOICE BEHIND ME FUCK YOU DOIN'? 
Turn back. GREASER in the doorway, brown-bagged T-Bird hits the floor as he reaches for his waist -- stand and shoot him in the throat. Drive the .45 into his sternum like a blade before I fire the second-third-fourth shots. He falls/flails.     * Jump-shock from the other room.                                   * 
ME                                            * POLICE!                                                 * 
Bodies scramble. No words. Just Pistol fire through the half-     * rotted walls -- punks taking potshots. No compliance means I      * hit the hallway shooting back. Firing dead-bang at a couple       * fleeing silhouettes -- see them pop-stumble-fall-                 * 
-the archway above my head shreds, collapses. Somebody firing a sub-machine gun. Flat on my ass, my back finds the wall,        * cough up plaster, sleeve my eyes to see. Then quiet, save the     * rattle-clap of changing clips.                                    * 
ME                                            * PUT THAT GOD DAMN GUN DOW-                              * 
TOMMY MAGDALENA (O.C.) -YOU SET ME UP YOU COCKSUCKER! 
Machine-gun fire lights up my left side. Roll. Taste floor        * grime as subsonic zips snap close...bullets miss by inches.       * 
TOMMY MAGDALENA -RAT FUCK COP! YOU KILLED HIM                           * WILHITE! 
Every part of me pauses...`Wilhite'...back door gets blunted open, frantic footfalls recede. That big bent V-8 on Tommy's `32 Deuce roars to life. Up now, plow through the cloud of cordite. See one of Tommy's Pachucos propped up against the       * wall, unhit, unhurt. Point my .45 and pull the trigger a I        * pass. Hit an empty chamber...this punk's lucky day. 
47   EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS                                      47 
Out the door reloading as the `32 Deuce barrels away. Tommy fires shots into the air to clear traffic. Wenzel in the          * passenger seat, screams to do the same. The Driver's side rim     * sparks fireworks.                                                 * 
Pandemonium out in front of Bido Lito's as the crowd stampedes ass-over-elbows. Sprint to my car, inside, key          * dispatch fast as I wheel rough off the curb:                      * 
ME Shots fired, 1600 block of Ivar.                        * Suspect fleeing scene in red `32                        * Ford Deuce travelling westbound on                      * Wilcox, vehicle impaired, intercept                     * at Hollywood Blvd- 
-horns blare as I slalom club-goers scrambling across Ivar. Punch it over-top Sunset, parallel to the Deuce. Rip a left       * on Selma. Stay on my radio: 
ME -and I need an ambulance to respond to 1607 North Ivar, second floor, female negro, possible overdose. 
Up ahead I catch a fireworks show: the Deuce gouges pavement      * across the 4-way. Clip 90 MPH catching up. Squeal onto Wilcox     * as Tommy hooks a right onto Hollywood.                            * 
Two prowlers pass the next second, sirens lit, full scream.       * 
48   EXT. HOLLYWOOD AND VINE - CONTINUOUS                         48 
Haul ass up to Hollywood, round it: See Tommy and Wenzel sitting upright, the Deuce spun sidelong, firing M3 `Grease Guns' into the approaching prowlers. Both cars go helter- skelter under fire. Six-packs spill to the street, belly          * crawl, brandish .38 service snubs and pop flimsy return fire. 
Tommy jumps down, runs, rifling his jacket for clips. Wenzel stays atop the car -- gun my engine, split the abandoned          * prowlers. Wenzel looks up mid-reload as I T-bone the `Deuce'      * at speed. The impact rockets him rag-doll end over end before     * he bombs back down to the street, wet sack, multiple bruises/fractures/breaks...blood pooling in pints. 
JUNIOR STEMMONS                              * Lieutenant!                                            * 
A hate-scowl for Junior: trying to put enough heat behind it     * to melt his head. Ainge lights up.                               * 
GEORGE AINGE                                 * Y'all are Cops!?                                       * 
ME                                           * Shut your mouth.                                       * 
Ainge sees me bent on Glenda. Looks past me, past the gun in     * his face, aims right at Junior.                                  * 
GEORGE AINGE                                 * Back in `50, Glenda the Good Witch                     * put a blade in her pimp `bout as                       * deep as I put my pink in her, this                     * mongrel named Dwight Gillette.                         * 
Junior fixes me, pulls that steno, starts scribbling openly -- * I grab it, shred it. Ainge grins at the voodoo between us.     * 
GEORGE AINGE (CONT'D)                        * Could use a couple LAPD favors, and                    * ain't guttin' a pimp still a crime?                    * 
JUNIOR STEMMONS                              * (aimed at ME)                                      * Capitol crime.                                         *

ME                                           * -show it to me.                                        * 
GEORGE AINGE                                 * I'll have my lawyer take a picture                     * of it for you-                                         * 
-throw his TV at his head: legitimately trying to kill him       * now and he knows it. Off his chair, crawling.                    * 
JUNIOR STEMMONS                             * STOP!                                                  * (more question than                                * statement)                                       * YOU ARE NOT BENT ON AN EX-WHORE!                       * 
I grab the shattered tube: throw it again. Big POP inches        * from Ainge. Angry at myself for missing twice:                   * 
ME                                           * GOD DAMN IT-                                           * 
JUNIOR STEMMONS                              * -HE'S A MATERIAL WITNESS TO A MURD-                    *

JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)                     * -YOU WILL CEASE AND DESIST KLEIN-                      * 
-final push with my foot gives me enough room to dead-bolt it    * behind him. Ainge can't fit under his bed.                       * 
GEORGE AINGE                                 * I AIN'T RESISTING YOU!                                 * 
ME                                           * I'm not arresting you.                                 * 
Flip the mattress. Teen Tit mags and jack-off socks fly with     * it. Ainge under pine slats. Panic. I put my foot through,        * bash his gut -- rip him out from underneath.                     * 
ME (CONT'D)                                  * (hissing)                                          * Where is it?                                           * 
Ainge unable to speak, gasping for air. Step to his closet:      * shred hinges when I open it. Rip the clothes rod down:           * nothing. Pull shelves from the wall: a Louisville Slugger        * falls at my feet. I smile. Ainge goes frightwig. Step to him.    * 
ME (CONT'D)                                  * WHERE?!                                                * 
Swing it into a wall. Gaping holes in holster. Bring it back like Babe Ruth over his head. 
ME (CONT'D)                                  * -that blade or your life.                              * 
Door bashed open behind me -- deadbolt assembly pops, pieces     * hit me -- then something big/black-metallic ends my night:       * Junior, tear-streaked cheeks, Ainge's mailbox in-hand, pulled    * free from the stucco. I drop. Ainge turns cheerleader:           * 
GEORGE AINGE                                 * NICE!                                                  * 
Roll to my knees: guttural groans I can't place   because        * they're mine. Junior rips a radio cord from the   wall, wraps    * it around my neck, pulls my head back, feel his   tears hit my   * shoulders. Veins in his arms go Pop. Eyes in my   head go Pop.   * 
JUNIOR STEMMONS                              * Last time you push me out a door!                      * For a dirty split-tail! You're-                        * (cinches hard) -not dragging me down! If Bradley doesn't get you, Noonan will! And- (through gritted-teeth)                            * -you're gonna burn all by yourself! 
-go black. Then eyes open...out for hours/days/months...what?    * 
Feel. Hangman's bruise forming around my neck. Junior and        * Ainge gone. Floorboards under Ainge's bed pried-up. Crawl to     * the hole: a hiding spot, empty of whatever was in it.            * 
ME (V.O.)                                    * Call it: the knife was here. Ainge                     * was crawling under his bed not to                      * escape me, but to hand it over. Too                    * hate-wired to see it.                                  * 
I check my watch: 11 PM.                                         * 
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)                           * Junior the Player. Junior the                          * Underestimated. Junior the Former                      * Evidence Teacher: a murder weapon,                     * a witness, a two-hour head-start.                      *

58   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - NEXT MOMENT                         58   * 
My glove box ripped open, contents gone.                        * 
Look up. Let him see it in my face: humorless and half lit.

Late. Pull in, plop the dishrag loaded with ice on the front      * seat. Blood still seeping, slick it back in my hair. Step         * from the car-- woozy/weaving, the goose-egg on my head feels      * like a hand grenade.                                              * 
Up the front walk, lean on the doorbell. She answers, Silk        * chemise barring tan shoulders, her hair swept up a long,          * perfect neck. If she just woke up, she doesn't look it.           * 
GLENDA BLEDSOE                                * I could say something witty about                       * "gentleman callers at this hour,                        * covered in blood" but--                                 * 
No time to trade repartee. Out with it:                           *

-click it off. Abrupt. She notices, says nothing. After another half mile she points to a side road: 655 TOPANGA CYN      * RD on the mailbox. I pull in. A gravel drive gives way to a       * bungalow, tucked into the trees.                                  *

Drop dimes. Dial Pete. 
ME Hey- 
PETE (O.S.) -Junior's left the fucking planet. 
ME You find him? 
PETE Yeah. I swung by his apartment, car was out front. I scoped it: a sawed- off shotgun in front, canned tuna in the back seat. Think he's living outta that car. After he left, I tried to get inside his place: The front door is triple pad-locked. 
ME (out loud) That knife is in there- 
PETE -the what? 
Shit. Ignore it, maybe Pete will too. 
ME Meet me down the street from his place. You got bolt cutters? 
PETE I'll bring `em. 
ME Thirty minutes. 
73   EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY                              73 
Junior's stucco-beige apartment building looms a block up. Cursory checks of the rear and side-view mirrors. Sans tail as I pull the Powerhawk in behind Pete's Caddy. Step out, sidle up driver's side. 
PETE Who's car is that? 
ME Long story. 
PETE Junior looked real skeezed this morning. Like he was on a dope jag. 
ME Yeah? 
PETE Sweated up like a stuck pig. And be careful. He was fucking around with his front door before he left. I don't know what he was doing. 
ME Two honks if he shows. Then meet me in the alley, back of his place. 
PETE (handing me bolt-cutters) What about this Bledsoe broad? Milteer has called me twice. 
ME (taking the bolt-cutters) One thing at a time pal. 
74   EXT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                    74 
Hustle across the street. Hang my badge over my shirt-pocket. 
75   INT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER          75 
Up three flights. Junior: #303: three padlocks:hinge/receiver hardware extending between door and jamb. Three kicks and a shoulder to splinter the door. Stop, look: Some kind of twine stretched taut, just inside the door...trip-wire. Pull my pig- sticker, extend it between door and jamb...see the twine stretching tighter -- flick the blade, snag twine, slice it. 
Stand. Put my boot into the door full. Snaps at the hinges. 
76   INT. APT. 303 - NEXT MOMENT                               76 
Move slow. Examine close: Eye-bolt pulley system, jerry- rigged around the door. Severed twine attached to the trigger of a shotgun taped atop a jello mold at knee level. 
Continue to look around. Sex-horror grimace: like catching Pop fingering Mom. Junior's place a tiny, filthy one bedroom. 
ME (V.O.) Junior the Insane: You couldn't hide what he was hiding in 1958 LA, and not have it rot your mind. 
Bear traps barely hidden under sheets. Rat-traps garnished with razor blades across the floor. Smell rotten flowers: his shirt that I wore/bled-on crumpled on his pillow -- yellowed jizz stains cover black blood stains. Stifle a gag. 
Card table: an empty green-banded evidence bag. Gape at it. Then walk over, read the abstracts: 1284 South Tremaine. 
Welles Noonan staring. He picks nipped/mutilated fingernails. 
ME (CONT'D) Civil servants can't afford manicures? 
WELLES NOONAN Breaking and entering, theft, and willful destruction of private property...and I'll add attempted murder to the current first degree murder charge I'm about to file against you. 
ME Proof. If you had it, you wouldn't be fucking around with shitty shakedown routine -- you'd file. Coercion equals confession. So let's see you pound it out of me. 
WELLES NOONAN Where are the files you stole from Sergeant Richard Stemmons. 
ME Junior. Your secret weapon right? I mean, I know J. Edgar is a slanted fuck, but traditionally `vicious fags' don't make the best major case witnesses. (beat, keep pushing) I'm worried those burning dildos may have damaged his credibility. 
WELLES NOONAN Oh I don't need his testimony Klein. I'll just force yours. 
ME Not if you had the next hundred years. 
WELLES NOONAN Sanderline Johnson, your links to Sam Giancana to Mickey Cohen, extortion, bribes, murder-for-hire. I'll put you in every pair of cross- hairs I can find. I'll torch everything you've ever touched. You have no idea how deep I run Klein. And how far I'm willing to go to fuck you- 
ME -everyone knows I'm a piece-a-shit. What are you proving? Bradley's the guy flanking you right now. The guy who's vulnerable right now. 
WELLES NOONAN You're all angles and graft Klein. Why trust a God damn word that comes out of your- 
ME -you done anything with the Magdalena case? 
WELLES NOONAN (thrown) Prelims: drug pusher gone missing, presumed dead, we're investigat- 
ME (scoffing) -Dealing drugs for 20 years! Arrested once. Hall a' fame career! You photographed the head of Narco in-front of his house... 
WELLES NOONAN AND? 
ME Jesus Christ, you need cue cards? (sell this fucker now) Come after me: you get me. Go after what I can give you and you get the LAPD's power-set on a slab. 
WELLES NOONAN I don't believe you'd turn. Treacherous yes, traitorous no. Tell me where Stemmons' files are. 
ME I'll bring them to you. 
WELLES NOONAN You're not leaving here Klein. 
ME Then like I said: you only get me. 
Noonan stands, firm: 
WELLES NOONAN I'll take it. 
On his way out I speak fast -- the last ace in my deck: 
ME I give you the body of Dan Wilhite, head of LAPD's Narcotics Division. Proof of a 20-year criminal collusion between his department and Hector Magdalena and my testimony to link the dots. (beat, make him believe) Then I leave LA for good. 
Noonan at the door: please bite-please bite...but he just smirks, walks out. Real panic now: no ideas on what comes next. 15 seconds. Door opens again: one of Noonan's deputies pushes a sheet. Scan it: Federal Witness Agreement. Noonan back: two cups of coffee. Read it over. 
WELLES NOONAN What happened to Wilhite? 
ME Suicide. 
WELLES NOONAN Like Sanderline Johnson? 
Ignore him. Sign the agreement. 
WELLES NOONAN (CONT'D) Get me Stemmons files and Wilhite's body by noon tomorrow. 
Gulp the coffee back, the burn feels good. 
ME No more tails. I don't want anyone else incriminated. 
WELLES NOONAN Agreed. 
ME (nod to agreement) I get a copy of that? 
WELLES NOONAN After a judge signs it. Now Leave. 
Stand-nod-take my coffee-leave. Door closes. Noonan shreds the Witness agreement. Tosses it in the trash. Off the baffled Deputy. 
WELLES NOONAN (CONT'D) We wait for him to deliver, then we arrest him. You never saw that agreement. 
DEPUTY #1 Tail him? 
WELLES NOONAN No. Let him get comfortable...let him believe me. 
83   INT. CAB - NIGHT                                             83 
Backseat. Suborned Cabby driving fast. LAPD on board. 
GLENDA BLEDSOE Or desperation. Depends on the day. 
The laughter ebbs, her eyes still shine. 
GLENDA BLEDSOE (CONT'D) I'll get there though. (beat) I'll get there. 
I let the silence take...try not to shatter it with: 
ME Dwight Gillette. 
She doesn't blanch. 
GLENDA BLEDSOE He asked me to take his `niece and nephew' to their cousin in Oxnard. These beautiful, funny little kids. (tears she doesn't swipe) I dropped them off. Didn't ask any questions -- I believed Dwight. A week later I saw their pictures in the Post Office. A week after that their little bodies came in on the tide near San Pedro. (beat, tears stream) I'll never shake the thought that maybe those poor kids thought I was part of it. That I knew what was going to happen to them. So I pray to God that he let them look in when I put that knife into Dwight. (beat) But I'll never ask his forgiveness for doing it... (beat, clears her eyes) Why do they call you `Enforcer?' 
She actually gets closer, I can feel her breath on me. 
ME I've killed 44 men. 
She blanches, but never blinks...never takes her eyes away from mine. 
ME (CONT'D) 33 for War. 2 for principle. 9 for profit -- mostly. Why did you sign with Hughes, knowing what he was? 
GLENDA BLEDSOE `For profit -- mostly.' 
Silence. A feeling like: `and there we are...' 
ME I'm not much good. 
GLENDA BLEDSOE Me neither. 
She touches my quake. Two breaths with her hand on mine and it all goes quiet: the shakes, the images, the fear. She takes my head, pulls me to her bare breasts. The only things audible: my breathing, a clock ticking. Both slowly fade out. 
BLACK. 
Wake up quiet, look at my Hamilton. 6 AM. Sit up slow. 
Look back at her, sleeping, just stare. I lean down, kiss her lightly, her taste lingers, inhale her, hold that...it's the last good thing you'll get today. 
88   INT. MEG'S HOUSE - EARLY A.M.                                88 
Dark. Stay quiet. Maneuver into the kitchen. Turn on a light. On the table: safe open, it's contents laid-out neatly, short- stacks of files, $1000 in twenties. I sit, start searching for something else...Pete's voice behind me: 
PETE (O.C.) The Knife ain't there. File on top of that middle pile: George Ainge in an `undisclosed locale.' 
I don't turn. Pete sits next to me. Sets a shotgun down. 
PETE Junior documented everything like a fucking Monk. (pulls a file) Like here: `has evidence' you murdered Sanderline Johnson. (MORE) 
PETE (cont'd) Kept track of `suspected contract killings' you pulled for the mob. 
Look at Pete. Dark rings, deathbed eyes. 
ME You been up all night? 
PETE In-case Stemmons made a house-call. He's got every goddamn address of everybody you know... (beat, hard) And you should've told me about the Bledsoe broad. 
ME There's nothing to tell. 
Feature Pete, righteously pissed: 
PETE Then call Milteer about this dead Pimp Gillette. I'm no legal mind like you, but I'll bet a murder beef would violate her morals clause quick. (beat, hands phone) Collect the rest of your money. 
ME I don't want it anymore. 
PETE Then give that five grand back. 
ME Junior stole it. 
Pete pauses, scoffs, turns back toward Meg's bedroom walks: 
PETE People are gonna start lining-up to see you bleed, Pal. 
Door closes. I flip through Junior's files: the same architect-neat block printing. Find a Glenda entry: 
SUBSEQUENT TO HER FATAL STABBING OF DWIGHT Gillette, MISS BLEDSOE SECRETED THE MURDER WEAPON WITH GEORGE AINGE. I HAVE ACQUIRED THIS KNIFE. IT IS A SIX-INCH BLADE WITH A MOTHER-OF-PEARL GRIP WHICH SUSTAINED RIGHT THUMB AND RIGHT INDEX PRINTS WHICH MATCH ELEVEN COMPARISON POINTS TO FINGERPRINTS ON FILE FROM MISS BLEDSOE'S 1946 JUVENILE SHOPLIFTING ARREST. 
Shred it. Grab another file. Hyper-detailed: subscript clarifications, attachments, pictures, procedural notes to the U.S.A.W.N.: United States Attorney Welles Noonan. 
Then I see the tab of the file furthest down: BOYCE BRADLEY. Open it: Noonan's business card stapled to the front cover. Flip forward. Scan. See Bradley's name, finger tracks across a page. A company name: `HURWITZ HOLDINGS' 
I read it all...and feel my jaw slowly unhinge... 
All Bradley can muster is: 
BRADLEY How? 
ME Junior Stemmons. The ex-evidence teacher. His `excellent ratings' didn't stop him from stealing the Magdalena seizure and doing his own investigation. 
BRADLEY Why would he investigate me? 
Hand him Noonan's business card: dig the big Federal Eagle in American Blue. 
ME That was stapled to the cover. (beat) Why would Noonan worry about a Turd like me now...when a high profile target like you can be taken down. 
Silence. I smile wide at it. Bradley, scrambling. 
BRADLEY Where is Stemmons? 
ME No idea. If you haven't spoken to Internal Affairs today, I'm sure they've called. Junior's apartment caught fire. Deeply deviant material inside. Round him up- (my angle) -and anyone he's got with him. 
Bradley readjusts his glasses. 
BRADLEY I'll issue an A.P.B. saying Stemmons is a known deviant targeting kindergarten children. 
ME Now, quid pro quo...you subpoenaed Wilhite too. 
Bradley's reaction: Feature the angler getting angled. 
BRADLEY How do y- 
ME -don't worry `how.' Why? 
Bradley says nothing. Then, like a klieg-light, it hits me. 
ME (CONT'D) You're going after Narco yourself. 
BRADLEY Exposing the corrupt parts of the LAPD will redeem the whole. I'll prove that Police can police themselves- 
ME -so you show-up Noonan...co-opt his crusade and condemn your own before he can...Jesus Christ can you turn lemons to lemonade. 
BRADLEY No Cop will testify against other Cops. This is why Wilhite has suddenly disappeared. 
ME And how. (beat) So where do we go now Chief? 
BRADLEY (beat, eyes flick again to the files I'm holding...) There are other forces at work here...faces we need to identify. Names we need to know. A third party. (MORE) 
BRADLEY (cont'd) Find out who Klein and I'll reinstate you, rescind that subpoena & burn the coroner's report on Sanderline- 
ME -that report is only useful to Noonan now. 
BRADLEY No. It ensures our mutual destruction should you choose to share the contents of that Stemmons file. Which I know you won't do until you figure out how it will best benefit you. 
He walks off, imperious, impervious, gets engulfed by the press ranks once again. 
ME (V.O.) A mistake to underestimate me now Chief. The price to keep your secrets is steep...and you're going to pay up. Soon. 
Back to the Powerhawk, fresh-scrubbed six-packs standing near it, the trunk stink ripe past the point of concealment. They see me, deferential nods. One squeaky wheel offers: 
SIX-PACK Something in your trunk smells to high hell Lieutenant. 
ME Dead body. 
Laughter. Easily amused academy types. Brush by grinning, give `em an "Enforcer" story to tell the other rookies. I jump in the Powerhawk and tear off. 
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) Borrowed time burning fast. My days are done. Only hours remain. Whatever moves I have left...make them now. 
91   INT. MEG'S HOUSE - LATER                                     91 
Going through files. Filling my own steno pad with scrawl. Pete walks in from the garage, face bunched up, bit-lemon. 
PETE Fucking Christ. You can't keep that car in the garage, the smell's coming into the house. 
Meg wanders in, dressed for work. 
MEG Open the windows. 
PETE That's not gonna help. 
ME (still scribbling) Take a couple bottles of bleach, pour it over the trunk. 
PETE What do you got in there? 
ME My foreseeable future. 
BRADLEY Things like? 
ME Stemmons files...and Wilhite's body. He committed suicide after you subpoenaed him. 
BRADLEY This body is in your possession? 
Just nod. 
ME And it's what you need to burn Narco to the ground...but if those files and his body were to be given to Noonan and the Feds, with me providing the cherry-on-top testimony of a rogue cop. Well. The word `Cataclysmic' comes to mind. 
BRADLEY What will this cost? 
ME A percentage of your Dodger Stadium stake in perpetuity. You buy my silence for a fourth of Hurwitz Holdings. 
Bradley scoffs, pithy smile. 
BRADLEY Doubtful. 
ME What'd you expect? A stick-up? Empty your safe? I'm about to disappear for good, and you're gonna fund my new life. You can't counter-punch out of this. Arrest me and I snitch the world. (point to the file) I'll hold that over your head for the rest of your life. Renege on our deal and it won't matter if it's tomorrow or ten years from now...I'll fry you with that file. (at my cracked Hamilton) I'm officially outta time now Chief. Call it. 
Bradley: an actual, full-blown facial tic. His Adam's apple bobs as he realizes that he's finally been beaten. 
BRADLEY Wilhite's body...Bury it. 
97   INT. PETE'S CADILLAC - MORNING                               97 
Cruising up the Topanga Canyon. Almost home... 
ME (V.O.) Shaking to see her, touch her... 
98   EXT. BUNGALOW - MORNING                                      98 
Door locked. Knocking. Pete opens up. Standing drunk. A pissed-off nod. 
99   INT. BUNGALOW - NEXT MOMENT                                  99 
Liquor wafts off of him. 
ME You go to bed drunk, or just been up all night. 
No answer as I follow him into the house. 
KLEIN Where's Glenda, is she asle- 
-round the corner: Glenda shaking but refusing to cry. I go pale: what is this? Somebody to the left, look: Milteer. Look back at Pete: tears in his bleary eyes as he crushes me with a right cross. 
ME (V.O.) Seen Pete do this a dozen times and every time the same thought: God help me if he ever hits me like that... 
Instant-drop, moan. Glenda screaming. 
ME (CONT'D) Don't kill me. 
Pete looks to Milteer, wipes blurred eyes. 
MILTEER The harder you hit him the quicker I say `stop' -- and cease that absurd crying. 
Pete bludgeons me. I try to get closer to Glenda. Feel my nose shatter. Another swing: right cheek detonates. A left hook to take advantage of my momentum: left eye explodes. Glenda's crying/screaming gets me madder than anything. 
GLENDA BLEDSOE (at Milteer) THAT IMPOTENT SHIT- 
MILTEER -touch me and he dies. 
Pete knocks me down again. My face in pieces. 
MILTEER (CONT'D) Kick him-kick him-kick him. 
Pete hesitates, puts his boot into my guts: 1, 2, 3- 
MILTEER (CONT'D) (prim, official) -you may stop. (beat, for the room) Howard determined that this was the price for your time together. 
Milteer produces a Polaroid, takes a snapshot of my shattered husk, hands the camera to Pete on his way out: 
MILTEER You still have a job. 
Milteer gone. I spit volumes of blood. I'll talk with a slur for the next year. Pete reaches for me, blotto, sobbing. 
PETE ...I'm sorry Dave... 
Pushing out words past shattered teeth. 
ME I put you here...that Powerhawk-

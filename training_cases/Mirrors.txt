"I give you the secret of all secrets. Mirrors are the gates through which death comes and goes. Tell no one." 
Orphée, Jean Cocteau

1A   INT. NIGHT - HARLEM SUBWAY STATION                             1A 
A subway screeches by at full speed revealing a station platform somewhere in Harlem. 
A man runs for his life in the deserted space. He's an African American male in his forties wearing a security guard uniform. 
He turns into an empty corridor, climbs a set of stairs towards the exit, but- The gates are down and the station is closed. 
Desperate and out of breath, he is forced to trace his way back, searching for an exit or a place to hide. He sees a door to the public restroom and runs inside. 
1B   INT. NIGHT - SUBWAY PUBLIC RESTROOM                            1B 
The place is deserted as well. One of the mirrors is smashed while the others are covered by graffiti and dirt - 
The neon lights are flickering, bringing the place in and out of the dark. 
The man checks each stall one at a time. 
His face lights up as he looks inside the last one- 
A SMALL WINDOW ABOVE THE TOILET IS JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO CRAWL THROUGH. 
He steps onto the toilet seat but the window is shut too tight. After a brief struggle, he swings it open, only to discover- 
A wall of bricks. 
Panic returns to his eyes. He slowly opens the stall door, fearful of what could be waiting outside. 
A FAINT SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS is heard. 
He quickly shuts the door, holding his breath. Frozen. 
Silence. 
His heart racing, he exits the stall in the direction of the sound. The place is empty. 
The room is revealed by flashes of flickering neon lights. 
He moves closer to the sinks and the spiderweb cracked mirror. His image is fragmented and deformed. It resembles a Cubist portrait.

MAN I'm sorry... I... I... I wasn't trying to get away... 
He talks to his own reflection in the mirror- 
MAN (CONT'D) No, please don't... 
He approaches and starts crying like a child. His head resting against the mirror, he pleads for his life. Then, seeing the dirt and grime on the mirror, his behaving shifts to another extreme. He starts cleaning it frantically with his hands. Too frantically- 
A piece of the spiderweb cracked mirror falls on the ground. 
Immediately, he bends down to pick it up but- 
HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR REMAINS STANDING IN SILENCE, WATCHING HIM. 
Looking up, the man realizes his reflection has become independent. A separate being... 
Terrified, he slowly stands staring at his stationary double. 
The pointy and sharp piece of broken mirror in his hand reflects the neon lights just like a knife blade. 
His eyes turn cold with fear when- 
HIS DOUBLE IN THE MIRROR STABS ITSELF DEEP IN ITS THROAT! 
IN REALITY, THE MAN HAS NOT MOVED AN INCH, YET HIS THROAT RIPS OPEN, RELEASING A RIVER OF BLOOD. 
Void of any facial expression, the man's reflection slices his jugular from end to end. 
In reality, the man chokes on his own blood which splatters on the mirror- TURNING THE IMAGE TO A DARK DEEP RED.

OPENING CREDITS ON- 
All the reflections catch in the glass buildings of Manhattan- 
They shake hands. 
LARRY You look awful. 
BEN Thanks Larry. 
LARRY You know, you should sleep at night. Come in... 
Ben follows him into the office. 
9   INT. DAY - LARRY'S' OFFICE                                    9 
Larry takes a seat and briefly looks over the messages and files that have been dropped off on his desk- 
LARRY So did you find an apartment yet? 
BEN No, not yet. 
LARRY You need a place to stay? 
BEN No, I'm staying at my sister's, in Queens. 
LARRY I didn't know you had a sister. What does she do? 
BEN She's a bartender. 
LARRY That's not too good for you! Anyway, you know you are always welcome to stay at our house. 
Larry looks up at Ben, slightly uneasy-

LARRY (CONT'D) I ran into Amy the other day. How are things going between the two of you? 
Ben remains silent. He obviously doesn't want to get into that subject. 
LARRY (CONT'D) So, why did you want to see me Ben? 
BEN You know what I want. I'm ready to come back, I'm feeling much better now. 
LARRY Listen Ben, I can't bring you back on the force. Nobody in the squad wants you around right now. I'm sorry but I have to be honest with you. You understand, right? 
BEN Larry, I'm telling you, I'm ready. 
LARRY If it was up to me, I would bring you back tomorrow, but I'm not the only one who decides. Listen, I think I've got something else for you. I know a guy at the Mayflower corporation and they need someone to watch over one of their department stores. 
BEN What?! Come on Larry, a security guard job... I'm not ready to retire yet! 
LARRY Hey! I'm just trying to help here. I know you're over qualified for that position but it's a good opportunity for you for the time being...until the situation here quiets down. Also the money is not that bad. 
Ben is having a hard time to contain his anger. 
LARRY (CONT'D) You need the money, Ben. You're in the middle of a divorce and you've got child support to cover. If you want to see your kids, you've got to get a job, any job. 
Deep inside, Ben knows Larry's right. 
(CONTINUED)

LARRY (CONT'D) Do you know the Mayflower on West 38th Street? 
BEN I do. The one that burned down? 
LARRY Yes, their night watchman hasn't shown up for work in several days. They need someone right away. Take it, relax, and we will talk about your situation again in a couple months. 
BEN Yeah, in a couple months... I gave everything for the NYPD. I almost died out there. Everyone seems to have forgotten that. 
LARRY I didn't. 
CUT TO: 
10   INT. DAY- CORONER'S OFFICE                                     10 
We discover a whole different world- 
In the sterile environment of the NYC Chief Medical Examiner's Office, forensic scientists with tape recorders in hand, describe the corpses. 
We are a world away from the Hollywood clichés of neatly laid out, immaculate cadavers. Here, some of the corpses have reached a state of advanced decomposition and others are still frozen in contorted positions, expressing their ultimate agony before dying. From the homeless man fished out of the river, to the woman killed by gun shots, each corpse tells his own story... 
Amidst the group of doctors 35-year-old AMY, deeply immersed in an autopsy, is interrupted by her cell phone. 
Amy checks the display for the incoming call- BEN. She hesitates for a moment and doesn't answer the call. 
Amy goes back to the postmortem analysis on her tape recorder. 
11   EXT. DAY - NEW YORK                                            11 
Dozens of pigeons fly away as the above ground subway passes by.

15   EXT. DUSK - MAYFLOWER - SECURITY GUARD TRAILER                15 
It's almost night. Ben and Lorenzo have finished their visit and exit the department store. 
LORENZO We were a pretty big team working here before the fire. When you stop to think that of all the department stores in New York, this one was the most beautiful, the most luxurious... It breaks your heart, it really does... 
(CONTINUED) 
15   CONTINUED:                                                       15 
Outside the building behind the fence blocking its entry, a construction trailer has been outfitted for the guards. 
LORENZO (CONT'D) Here you go. This is where you'll be spending most of your time. At least you've got electricity in here. It's nice and warm, and there's even a TV. 
16   INT. NIGHT - SECURITY GUARD TRAILER                              16 
Cartoons flicker on an old television set. All bundled up in a coat, and wearing a woolen hat, a young boy is watching TV. Lorenzo and Ben enter the mobile home- 
LORENZO Lorenzo Junior, my grandson... Say hello Lorenzo. 
LORENZO JR. Hello. 
LORENZO Lorenzo and I are going to the movies tonight... 
Lorenzo strokes his grandson on the head and proceeds to the back of the mobile home, leaving Ben alone with the child. The boy looks almost hypnotized by the images on TV. 
BEN How old are you, Lorenzo? 
LORENZO JR. 
Lorenzo Jr. shifts his attention from the cartoons and stares Ben in the face- 
LORENZO JR. (CONT'D) Do you work in the department store? 
BEN I do now. 
LORENZO JR. Grandpa says there are ghosts in the store... Is that true? 
Ben smiles. 
BEN I think your grandpa just wants to scare you a little. 
(CONTINUED) 
16   CONTINUED:                                                       16 
Lorenzo Senior has changed clothes, and returns with a uniform, which he hands over to Ben- 
LORENZO Here, this should fit you. Lorenzo, put your coat on... We are already late. (to Ben, on the sly) There's a drop of Jack Daniel's in the cupboard... To keep yourself warm. 
Lorenzo hands over the keys- 
LORENZO (CONT'D) Well, Ben, the place is all yours. 
He's about to leave when- 
LORENZO (CONT'D) Oh! I forgot the most important thing... the flashlights! You'll be needing one of these at night. We've got two of them. They run on batteries. Don't forget to charge them... See you in the morning, Ben. 
BEN See you tomorrow. 
Lorenzo and Lorenzo Jr. exit the trailer. Through the window, Ben sees them walk out to the street. 
Ben inspects the trailer- scattered with knickknacks, the decoration of the place corresponds well with Lorenzo's personality - warmhearted and humble. 
The clock on the wall shows 7 p.m.... A long night lies ahead. 
Ben grabs a flashlight and turns it on. The beam of light is dazzling- 
CUT TO: 
17   INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER - A FEW HOURS LATER                        17 
The flashlight sweeps across the dark entrance hall. 
Wearing the security guard's uniform marked with an embroidered "M", Ben makes his first round of the store. 
The pigeons perched on the roof seem to observe him. 
Ben proceeds slowly up the stairs. 
18    - SECOND FLOOR -                                                18 
In the Men's department, Ben's flashlight is a mere luminous spot twirling in the night. 
The ever-present mirrors magnify the space to infinity. 
19    - THIRD FLOOR -                                                 19 
Ben walks through the different sections of the Ladies' department. He examines the remains of the charred garments sagging on the hangers. 
The silhouettes of the burnt mannequins emerge in the gloom of the night. 
STRANGE AND DISTURBING SHAPES REFLECT OFF THE MIRRORS. 
19A   EXT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER                                          19A 
BEN Fuck... 
A few inches of water cover the basement floor. One of the water pipes must have burst due to the cold. 
(CONTINUED) 
36   CONTINUED:                                                       36 
The light flickers back for a moment, revealing before him-        the narrow subterranean corridors of the department store. 
Along a wall, Ben finds a fuse box and pushes some of the switches. Further down in the corridor, a couple of fluorescent lights flicker to life- two tiny sources deep inside the darkness. 
AS BEN DISCOVERS HIS SURROUNDINGS, THE CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY, UP ALONG THE STAIRS, THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR, IT ACCELERATES AND STOPS IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR- 
IN THE REFLECTION, WE SEE THE BASEMENT DOOR SHUT... 
FADE TO BLACK 
37   EXT. DAY - NEW JERSEY STREET                                       37 
It's been snowing all day and a white coat of powder outlines the trees and houses. 
On the front lawn of their house, 5 year old MICHAEL and 7 year old DAISY are building a snowman. 
MICHAEL Why did they say on TV that it wasn't supposed to snow today, but tomorrow instead? Why did they lie? 
DAISY Sometimes they make mistakes, Michael. It happens... 
MICHAEL Grown-ups don't make mistakes. Only little children do. 
Slightly annoyed, the little boy places the eyes on the snowman. 
Daisy's face lights up with a big smile when she catches sight of her father's car approaching- 
DAISY Daddy! 
Michael turns around and sees Ben exiting his 1986 Oldsmobile, with a big wrapped package in his arms. 
The children abandon their snowman and rush towards their father. Ben takes Michael into his arms- 
MICHAEL (pointing to the wrapped present) What is that? 
(CONTINUED) 
37   CONTINUED:                                                     37 
BEN Well I don't know, I just found this package hidden behind a tree. 
MICHAEL Is it for me? 
BEN Maybe... (to his daughter) Daisy, has Michael been a good boy? Does he deserve his birthday present? 
Michael nods. 
DAISY No! Yesterday he finished the whole bag of candy when mom had told him he could only have one piece. 
MICHAEL Not true! 
DAISY Yes it's true! 
MICHAEL No, it's not true... She's lying Daddy. I've been a very good boy, I promise. 
They enter the house. 
BEN Is mom back? 
DAISY Not yet. Rosa came to pick us up from school today. 
38   INT. DAY - HOUSE - CONTINUITY                                  38 
In the kitchen, ROSA, the nanny, is rinsing the dishes from the afternoon snack- 
BEN Hello Rosa! 
ROSA Hello Señor Carson. How are you? 
BEN I'm good, very good... What time will Amy be back? 
(CONTINUED) 
38   CONTINUED:                                                     38 
ROSA Not before six, Sir... 
BEN OK, I'll wait for her. 
ROSA Do you want me to fix you a snack? 
BEN No, thank you. I'll be fine. 
Ben takes off his coat and joins the kids in the living room. He hands over the present to his son. 
Daisy is sitting in the armchair, holding her cat, TIGER, in her arms. 
BEN (CONT'D) Happy birthday, Michael. 
Ben exits the room. Amy is left alone- 
Through the window, she watches Ben exit the house and get into his car. 
When she turns away, she discovers Michael and Daisy standing outside the bathtub dripping wet in their towels. She smiles, and quickly comes to dry them. 
MICHAEL Mom? 
AMY Yes, honey. 
MICHAEL Is Daddy coming back to live with us? 
She smiles gently. 
AMY I don't know sweetheart. I don't know. 
43   INT. DAY - BASEMENT CORRIDOR MAYFLOWER                        43 
The beams from the flashlight are reflected in the few inches of water flooding the basement corridor. Since yesterday, the water level has continued to rise. 
The outline of Ben and Lorenzo's silhouettes appear in the staircase leading to the ground floor- 
BEN I haven't managed to find the source of the leak. My guess is it doesn't come from the store... It must be a municipal pipe that blew with the cold... 
LORENZO I'll call the company tomorrow morning and have them come take a look at it. 
44   INT. NIGHT- SECURITY GUARD TRAILER                            44 
On the gas stove, a kettle is whistling. 
(CONTINUED) 
44   CONTINUED:                                                     44 
Ben rummages through the cupboards and the drawers. He finds some instant coffee next to the bottle of Jack Daniels. He briefly hesitates between the coffee and the whisky... 
He grabs a cup and pours the boiling water into the instant coffee. 
In the reflection of the clock, we see Ben watching TV. It is past midnight. Ben gets up and grabs his flashlight- It's time for his rounds. 
45   INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER CENTRAL HALL                            45 
Through the shattered panes of the central dome, we see Ben walking through the store. 
Since the mysterious occurrences of the night before, his attitude has changed. He avoids, as much as possible, looking into the mirrors. He is on guard, fearing another supernatural manifestation. 
The shadows, the mannequins, and the shapes in the mirrors are all disturbing and unsettling. 
Even what remains of the sculptures on the top of the marble columns seems alive in the dark. 
As he crosses the entrance hall, a glint of light catches his attention. Despite himself, he stops and gazes into the mirror- 
AT THE FAR END OF THE STORE, ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS IS IN FULL SWING AND BATHED IN DAYLIGHT! EVERYTHING IS SPOTLESS, AS IF THE FIRE HAD NEVER TAKEN PLACE. CUSTOMERS COME AND GO AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED. 
How is this possible? Ben turns around to see the same spot in the real world- ONLY IT'S IN RUINS... 
Ben glances back at the reflection in the mirror- 
The vision of the past prevails. Unable to ignore it, Ben decides to check it out for himself... 
Ben wanders off towards the far end of the store, a landscape of dust and desolation. HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR, ON THE OTHER HAND, HEADS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE "FLASHBACK"- 
We follow him in the mirror- 
Ben has left the night behind and enters the "daytime" department. Everything is in perfect order and unspoiled. 
Ben continues his journey into the past. 
(CONTINUED) 
45   CONTINUED:                                                       45 
The customers jostle one another while shopping during a big sale. Children run wild in the aisles. Women fight over articles of clothing. 
Ben stops dead in his tracks when he notices, around his shoes, a transparent liquid spilling out on the floor- 
He bends down and dips his fingertips into the liquid- GASOLINE. Gallons of flowing gasoline gradually spreading over the floor of the department store. 
Ben turns around and sees, under the shelving, A HAND LIGHTING A ZIPPO- 
The lighter falls to the floor in slow motion. 
The liquid bursts into flame instantly. THE CHEERFUL VISION OF A DAY IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE QUICKLY TURNS INTO A NIGHTMARE- 
EVERYTHING IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THE CLOTHES, THE MANNEQUINS AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, THE CROWD! THE AGONIZING SHRIEKS OF PAIN AND PANIC ARE DEAFENING. 
Frightened, Ben steps back- 
The flames spread quickly to the escalators where the crowd has rushed to escape death- 
HORRIFIC VISIONS OF PEOPLE BURNING ALIVE... INCINERATED FLESH. FACES DISTORTED BY THE PAIN, SKIN MELTING TO THE BONE. 
In the midst of the flames through the heat waves, Ben spots the face of the firestarter- IS IT HIS OWN? 
Ben has no time to react. In a split second, his uniform catches fire. 
Sensing something wrong, Ben turns around. 
In the silence he faces his infinite reflections, all of them identical- OR ALMOST... 
Taking a closer look Ben notices one of the duplicates' faces bearing an expression slightly different from the others'. A SUBTLE GRIN. 
(CONTINUED) 
54    CONTINUED: (2)                                                 54 
Knowing that it has been noticed by Ben, the "rebel duplicate" turns his face towards Ben, eyeing him with an evil gaze- 
We can hardly recognize Ben's image. 
The duplicate takes a step forward from the line of the other reflections and slowly walks towards Ben. 
Instinctively, Ben closes his eyes in an attempt to make the vision disappear. 
When he opens up his eyes again- 
HIS EVIL DOUBLE RUSHES TOWARDS HIM- 
Ben steps back terrified. 
CUT TO: 
55    INT. DAY- CORONER'S OFFICE                                     55 
Under the dazzling neon light of the NYPD coroner's premises, Amy is in full swing submitting her conclusions on a homicide to the police inspectors in charge of the investigation. 
She is interrupted by somebody who enters the room- There is someone for her at the reception, who insists on seeing her urgently. Amy excuses herself, removes her examination gloves, and exits the autopsy room. 
We follow her down the corridors as she passes men in police uniforms and doctors in white coats, in the endless comings and goings between the police station and the hospital. 
The atmosphere here is highly charged, reflecting the excessive activity of this particular department. There is no doubt- we are in New York City. 
55A   CORONER'S OFFICE LOBBY - CONTINUOUS                           55A 
Amy comes to the reception desk. Ben, who clearly hasn't slept since the night before, is pacing back and forth. 
AMY Are you OK? What's happening? What are you doing here? 
BEN Amy, I need you to do me a favor... 
(CONTINUED) 
55A   CONTINUED:                                                   55A 
AMY Listen, I am in the middle of work, I don't really have time now. 
BEN I need your help... It won't take more than twenty minutes. Please, Amy? 
From his pocket, Ben takes out Gary's driver's license. He shows it to her- 
BEN (CONT'D) You picked up this guy yesterday morning... I need to take a look at him. It's very important. 
AMY Why do you want to see him? 
BEN He used to work at the Mayflower as a night watchman, before I replaced him. 
AMY Where did you get his driver's license? 
BEN I found his wallet in the department store. I need to find out how he died... 
AMY You are no longer a cop, Ben. This isn't your business anymore. 
BEN He sent me a package before he died, with newspaper articles about the Mayflower... I think he was trying to tell me something... I don't know him. I've never even met him, Amy... I need to figure this out. 
56    INT. DAY - MORGUE                                              56 
The refrigerated compartment bays, containing the corpses, are aligned along the basement walls. 
A young doctor escorts Ben and Amy down the corridors of the morgue. As he is walking, the doctor flips through the register, in search of a name. 
(CONTINUED) 
56   CONTINUED:                                                      56 
YOUNG DOCTOR Gary Lewis... Gary Lewis... Oh, there he is, 58B... He slashed his throat... 
AMY (to Ben) There you go... There's your answer. Your man committed suicide. 
BEN You know a lot of people who cut their own throats? 
YOUNG DOCTOR (interrupting) Well, all I know is that the cops are still investigating this one. That's why we still have the body. People can be very creative when it comes to suicide. I'm sure it's not the craziest thing you've seen. 
The young doctor stops in front of the number 58B. He opens the door to the refrigerated compartment bay and pulls out the tray carrying the corpse, wrapped in a white sheet- 
YOUNG DOCTOR (CONT'D) Gary Lewis... 
He lifts the sheet, revealing Gary Lewis' upper body- 
Gary's eyes are rolled upwards and his throat is wide open. His skin has become translucent, almost purple. His contorted corpse is frozen in a deadly expression of profound suffering... His flesh has started to decompose and putrefy. 
Ben stares at the body, in search of a hint, a clue, any useful information... 
AMY (irritated) OK... This is way over my head. I don't have time for your barfly theories. 
Ben realizes that he will not succeed in convincing her. Not today. 
BEN Thanks for your help... 
He's on his way out, when she holds him back- 
AMY You should go home and get some rest. This guy probably just killed himself because he couldn't live with himself anymore. It happens to thousands of people, you know... 
CUT TO: 
58   INT. DAY - APARTMENT QUEENS - BATHROOM                           58 
The steam has fogged up the mirror of the medicine cabinet. 
Ben grabs a towel and steps out of the shower. 
He watches his blurry reflection. With his finger, on the surface of the fogged mirror, he writes- 
ESSEKER 
He contemplates the dripping letters for a long moment, trying to interpret their meaning. 
(CONTINUED) 
58   CONTINUED:                                                     58 
In the end, he wipes off the mirror with his hand, erasing the word. 
Angela is standing behind him in the door opening- 
ANGELA I'm off... Amy called me today, she's worried about you. What's happening, Ben? 
BEN Please, not you... 
ANGELA I'm your sister, you can talk to me. Is it your new job? That place, the Mayflower, has bad vibes. It's getting under your skin. Just think about what I told you... 
BEN I made a deal, Angie... I can't just walk out on them like that. I need this job, I need the money. I'm not going to sleep on your couch for the rest of my life! 
ANGELA You won't have any trouble finding another one. A daytime job, a regular job... 
While she's talking, we see the scene from another point of view- from inside the mirror- As if SOMEONE ELSE WAS LISTENING TO THEM. 
Angela leaves the bathroom. Ben brushes his teeth. He leans over to rinse his mouth, and when he straightens up- 
IT IS NOT HIM IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MIRROR, BUT GARY LEWIS WHO SLASHES HIS THROAT FROM END TO END WITH A SHARP PIECE OF MIRROR- 
Ben steps back and loses his balance, knocking down a shelf. Angela rushes into the bathroom- 
ANGELA (CONT'D) What happened Ben? Are you all right? 
He refuses her help. 
BEN LEAVE ME ALONE... 
Ben gets to his feet and looks into the mirror. His reflection is back. Everything looks normal but-

CUT TO: 
59   EXT. DAY- GARY LEWIS' BUILDING                                 59 
The sun sets behind the Harlem skyline. 
Ben's Oldsmobile pulls over in the street- He has decided to pass by Gary Lewis' old house before his nightshift. 
He presses the doorbell next to Gary Lewis' name. An old lady answers- 
BEN Mrs. Lewis... Sorry to bother you... My name is Ben Carson. I worked with Gary, at Mayflower. Could I come up and talk to you for a few minutes? 
Silence. 
BEN (CONT'D) Mrs. Lewis ? 
MRS. LEWIS ...5th floor, apartment 3B... 
The entrance door of the building opens. 
CUT TO: 
60   INT. DAY- MRS. LEWIS' APARTMENT                                60 
MRS. LEWIS is at least 80 years old, and almost blind behind her thick glasses. She lives alone in the small apartment that she used to share with her grandson. 
We sense that she is distraught by Gary's death. 
MRS. LEWIS ...My Gary hadn't slept at home for three weeks. At first I figured he had found himself a girlfriend, so I didn't worry much about it... It's terrible. The policeman told me that he was living in the streets... They found his body in the subway. Why? He had everything he needed here. Every morning I would have his breakfast ready when he'd come home from work. 
(CONTINUED) 
61A   INT. NIGHT - LADIES' DEPARTMENT DRESSING ROOMS                61A 
The screams come closer. Ben passes the counters and enters the dressing rooms - or rather, what is left of them since the fire. 
The woman must be in here, hiding somewhere. 
(CONTINUED) 
61A   CONTINUED:                                                  61A 
BEN I'm here Ma'am... 
Short of breath, Ben inspects the dressing rooms with his flashlight. 
The woman seems to have vanished. 
BEN (CONT'D) Ma'am? I'm right he... 
ANOTHER SHRIEK IS EMITTED, RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. He turns around- 
No one there. 
About to leave the dressing rooms, Ben catches sight of a mirror. In the reflection he sees the row of empty rooms- 
A BLOODY HAND BURSTS OUT FROM THE LAST ONE, ACCOMPANIED BY ANOTHER PIERCING SCREECH OF PAIN! 
Ben runs to it, but finds it empty. IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MIRROR, HOWEVER, THE HAND IS STILL STRETCHED OUT TOWARDS HIM! 
Ben stops to think- If he can somehow move the mirror to have it face the last booth, he might be able to see what truly happened inside. 
Ben unhooks the mirror. 
It is way too heavy and bulky to carry. He lets it slide down the wall. 
Inch by inch, Ben hauls the mirror across the floor. 
He reaches the last dressing room- 
Through the reflection in the mirror, he examines the interior of the cubicle. 
In the dark he catches sight of BARE FEET STAMPING AGAINST THE TILED FLOOR. The torn, half-burnt curtains conceal the rest of the body... 
With his eyes fixed on the mirror, Ben walks backward towards the dressing room. He is scared of what he is about to discover. He gives the curtain a quick yank, revealing- 
A NAKED YOUNG WOMAN IS GOING INTO SPASMS AND SCREECHING WITH PAIN. DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF REAL FLAMES, HER SKIN AND FLESH ARE ROASTING, AS IF SHE WERE BURNING ALIVE FROM THE INSIDE OUT!

62    INT. NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE                                  62 
We are in the darkness of Daisy and Michael's bedroom. Michael is terrified and cries out for his mother- 
MICHAEL Mom! Mom! 
Amy swings the door open and turns on the light. 
AMY What is it Michael? 
The little boy throws himself into his mother's arms. Daisy wakes up. 
AMY (CONT'D) What is it? Did you have a bad dream? 
MICHAEL There's a lady screaming... 
AMY Where Michael? 
Michael points to the mirror wall facing the bunk beds. 
MICHAEL There... In the mirror... 
AMY No, Michael... Look, there's nothing there. 
MICHAEL I saw her mom. I swear I did. 
AMY It was just a nightmare. It's late, you have to go back to sleep. I'll turn on the night-light, if you want. 
Amy tucks him into bed and kisses him. Before leaving the room she plugs in the night-light. 
DAISY Mom, can you leave the door open? 
AMY Sure sweetheart... OK, you two go to sleep now. 
(CONTINUED) 
62   CONTINUED:                                                     62 
Amy leaves the room. 
The camera flashes illuminate the crime scene. 
Angela's body lies afloat in the bathtub. The apartment is entirely flooded. 
Two men in police uniforms close off a security zone, to keep the intrusive neighbors away. 
A detective is interrogating an old Puerto Rican couple- the downstairs neighbors. They were the ones who alerted the police, after having noticed the water leakage. The old woman explains how "it was raining blood into her living room"... 
Amongst the police officers and the legal medical squad, we find Larry. He is in charge of the case. 
Leaning over the bathtub, Larry examines the visible parts of the corpse. Angela's face is concealed by her own long black hair, floating in the murky water. 
Larry slips on an examination glove, pulls up his sleeve and sinks his arm into the blood-red bath. He feels around for the chain of the plug in order to drain the bathtub. 
The water level begins to recede, gradually revealing Angela's naked corpse. 
With the tip of his fingers, Larry lifts away the few strands of hair covering Angela's face-

Taken by surprise, he steps back from the horrifying sight of this JAW-LESS FACE. 
Larry removes his glove, wipes off his bloodied arm and starts to leave the bathroom when something else catches his attention- 
He comes closer to the spiderweb cracked medicine cabinet mirror. A TINY DROP OF BLOOD is dripping from one of the cracks. 
Strange. 
A DARK SILHOUETTE PASSES BEHIND HIM IN THE REFLECTION. He turns immediately- The bloodied bathroom is still and silent. Angela's destroyed body lies in the empty bathtub. 
A police inspector in the next room, calls out to him- 
POLICE INSPECTOR O.S. Larry? Take a look at this... 
LARRY What is it? 
POLICE INSPECTOR O.S. Come take a look for yourself. 
Larry exits the bathroom. The police inspector in the living room holds a picture frame in his hands. He turns towards Larry- 
POLICE INSPECTOR Look... Isn't Ben Carson in the picture? 
CUT TO: 
67   INT. DAY - POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM                    67 
Still wearing his uniform, Ben is sitting alone in one of the interrogation rooms of the police station. His haggard face expresses great grief. His sister's death has left him distraught. 
He fiddles with an empty plastic cup in his hands. 
The classic two-way mirror facing him, throws back his reflection. 
Ben knows that he is being watched. 
Behind the two-way mirror, Amy observes him. Larry is standing next to her. 
LARRY The water has obliterated most of the marks. No trace of struggle or broken entry, the entrance door was locked. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
67   CONTINUED:                                                     67 LARRY (CONT'D) The person who did this must have had the keys to her apartment, or otherwise it was somebody she knew... 
AMY He would never have laid a finger on her. When their father died, Ben took care of his sister. Angela meant the world to him. 
LARRY Listen, so far, his statement is pretty consistent with the facts... We checked it out, he did place a call from work at 12:30, and the woman's downstairs neighbors claim they started noticing the water leakage at around two in the morning. The daytime security guard, Lorenzo Sappeli, confirms he came on after Ben's shift at seven a.m. The only strange thing, and it may just be a coincidence, is that Ben told Sappeli that he had decided to quit his job, as if he was planning to go away somewhere... Did he mention anything about it to you? 
AMY No, lately, communication hasn't quite been our strong point... (she smiles) I only found out yesterday that he was staying at his sister's. What are you going to do with him? 
LARRY I figure we'll let him go. At this point we haven't got any real reason to keep him here. And, I think he's had his share for the day. 
AMY You know what's gonna happen if you let him go. He won't stop here. I know him, he won't stop until he finds who did this to her. 
LARRY Listen, where we stand now, we got nothing, not a single clue. I'm sure he can help us. 
AMY What kind of friend are you? You are using him. He's not a cop anymore.

LARRY He's still the best one I know, even if he's one of the suspects. 
Amy comes closer to the two-way mirror. She looks at her ex- husband on the other side. He seems overcome with grief and confusion. She can see the distress in his eyes. 
LARRY (CONT'D) Try to keep an eye on him.

CUT TO: 
72   INT. NIGHT -QUEENS APARTMENT                                       72 
Back in the Queens apartment, Ben still hasn't gotten any sleep. On the wall, he is assembling all the newspaper clippings, articles and photographs that Gary sent him. 
Each and every mirror in Angela's apartment has been covered with sheets, blankets, old rags- anything he could find to neutralize the reflective surfaces. 
With the phone cradled between his ear and shoulder he is in the middle of a heated conversation- 
BEN ...Look up Esseker... Yes, Echo, Sierra, Sierra, Echo, Kilo, Echo, Romeo... Esseker. No idea, my guess is that it's a name... No, I haven't got a first name. Yes, in New York. Over the past five or six years. I know it's hazy but that's all I've got. I already looked it up in the phone book. I also called someone at the IRS and at the DMV, but nothing there. It's very important Larry. You'll call me back? Ok... 
Ben hangs up the phone and remains in front of the wall covered with clippings for a moment. Now he can have a clear overview of Gary's investigative research. 
All the articles date back approximately to the same period and are all related to the fire that ravaged Mayflower five years ago. 
But not a hint of Esseker. 
Ben studies the newspaper clippings, trying to piece the story together- 
" Deadly Fire at Mayflower- 29 dead and 78 wounded " 
"   Brutal Massacre- Mother and her three daughters slaughtered..." 
" ...the children, drowned, in the bathtub... " 
" ...the throat slit open... " 
" Mayflower's security guard taken in for questioning... " 
(CONTINUED) 
72   CONTINUED:                                                     72 
" The night watchman confesses to setting the fire but firmly denies the accusation of murdering his family... " 
" Terrence Berry confesses but claims the mirrors are guilty- The security guard at Mayflower finally confesses. He started the fire in the department store with the intention of destroying the mirrors, responsible, according to him, for the death of his wife and three daughters. " 
Ben observes Terrence Berry's face in one of the archive photographs. He looks like a perfectly normal guy, rather kind, surely he was a good father... Ben can't help but empathize with him. 
As he looks up, Ben catches a glimpse of his reflection in the window- 
What if he too lost his mind and went on to slaughter his family? Or what if the mirrors would do it? 
The phone rings- 
BEN (CONT'D) Yes, so, what'd you find out? Nothing under that name? Shit, shit, shit, shit... Can you look up Berry, Terrence Berry... 
Ben holds on the line, for a moment. 
BEN (CONT'D) ...Got anything? Great...No, I already know all that. Is he still alive? No... Can you find out where he was committed before his death? Wait, I'm writing it down... 
Ben sits down on the bed and scribbles down the address on a piece of paper. 
BEN (CONT'D) ...Roosevelt Psychiatric Detention Center... Yeah, I know where it is. Thanks. 
He hangs up the phone. Under the blanket, next to him, he spots the T-shirt that his sister was wearing the other night. 
The pain is too strong. He cannot hold back his tears anymore and starts crying.

The next morning - 
Heavy-eyed and sleepy, Michael is hypnotized in front of the weather forecast on TV. 
The hot chocolate set in front of him is getting cold. His sister Daisy pours herself some more orange juice. Amy, shaking a box of cereal, interrupts the little boy in his dream state- 
AMY Do you want the cereal in your hot chocolate or in a separate bowl? 
The little boy does not answer. 
AMY (CONT'D) Michael? 
MICHAEL In the chocolate... 
AMY ...In the chocolate, please, mom... 
MICHAEL (repeating after her) ...Please, mom. 
She pours the cereal in his hot chocolate. 
DAISY Yuck, that's gross, how can you eat that? 
AMY Come on, come on, let's get going, or you're going to be late for school. 
Michael begins to eat his breakfast, his gaze still fixed on the weatherman's forecast on TV. As Amy fills the cat's bowl with pellets, Tiger rushes over to join the rest of the family.

Ben drives nervously. He feels guilty about his conduct in front of the children. A thousand thoughts rush through his head, leaving him in an utter state of confusion. He doesn't know what to do nor what to think anymore. 
Ben reaches for his cell phone and dials Larry's number- 
BEN Hello, Larry? It's me... I'm going to need your help again- 
LARRY (O.S.) Come on, Ben... For Christ's sake! What are you doing? 
BEN Mayflower used to be a hospital before it became a department store. St. John's Hospital. Do you have any idea where all the medical records could have ended up after it closed down? 
LARRY (O.S.) How am I supposed to know that?! 
BEN Go to the city hall archives... They must have something considering it was a public hospital. 
LARRY (O.S.) I've got others things to do. I can't go to City Hall today. I've - 
BEN Larry, Larry stop it... If I could go myself, I wouldn't be asking you. Go to the City Hall archives, and ask them to look up Esseker among the former patients. Please. 
LARRY (O.S.) Ben, for god's sake, what are you trying to prove? 
BEN Please, do it for me. 
LARRY (O.S.) You know you're a real pain in the ass.

BEN Talk to you later. 
Ben hangs up. 
He glances back at the rear view mirror and sees ANGELA'S CORPSE, SITTING ON THE BACK SEAT! 
Startled, he loses control of the vehicle. A truck approaches at full speed in the opposite lane. He barely avoids the collision. 
Two other cars appear. Ben zigzags in and out, just barely avoiding a fatal crash. 
He stops along the edge of the road. 
Ben closes his eyes and rests his head against the steering wheel in an attempt to clear his mind. He looks up into the rear- view mirror again- 
ANGELA'S REFLECTION IS STILL THERE. Behind her long black hair, she fixes him with a milky gaze. 
Ben flies into a rage. HE SMASHES THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR WITH HIS BARE FIST, REDUCING IT TO SCRAPS... 
Ben is alone and lost. 
BEN (CONT'D) What have I done? I don't understand... What have I done? 
Insert on what is written on the side rear-view mirror- 
"OBJECTS IN MIRROR ARE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR" 
83   EXT. NIGHT -MANHATTAN STREET - NYPD POLICE STATION              83 
Under the pouring rain, the police patrol cars come and go in front of the police station. 
A bit further away we recognize Ben's Oldsmobile, parked on an adjacent street. Ben is waiting inside. 
A man approaches, knocks on the car window and enters the vehicle. It's LARRY- 
The rainwater drips down his raincoat. Under his arm he holds a file of documents, wrapped in a plastic bag. 
LARRY This ought to make you happy... (handing him the file) Anna Esseker...

Ben nervously tears open the plastic wrapping- 
LARRY (CONT'D) I wasn't quite sure what you needed, so I got all of her medical records. 
BEN Perfect, Larry. That's perfect. 
Ben skims through the pages. He cannot believe that he has finally discovered who Esseker is... 
LARRY Everyone's real edgy up there. You're still a fuckin' murder suspect. People are wondering why I let you out. You have to tell me more. What does the history of the Mayflower have to do with the death of your sister? 
BEN I don't know exactly. I can't tell you, but some really fucked up things started happening to me when I took the job over there. Nothing makes any sense to me either but I have to follow my instinct. 
Larry notices the broken rear-view mirror- 
LARRY What happened? Did you have an accident? 
Ben is too absorbed in the records. He doesn't answer. 
BEN Anna Esseker... Where did you find her files? Did you go to City Hall? 
LARRY No, you were wrong about that, they had nothing. All the medical records from St. John's Hospital are still up there with the unclassified cases. 
Ben squints at him. 
The little boy does as his mother says.      He gets up and dashes out of the room. 
Amy's glance freezes in horror. Terrified, she almost loses her balance- 
MICHAEL'S REFLECTION IS STILL IN THE MIRROR, SITTING IN A SQUATTING POSITION! 
HE LOOKS AT AMY WITH A BIG SMILE. 
Amy attempts to speak but can't- 
The mirror image of her son remains silent. 
Amy steps closer to the mirror and, in the reflection, behind the boy, she discovers- 
HER MIRROR IMAGE IS THERE TOO, BEARING THE SAME FORCED GRIN...

BEN I'm right here, Amy. I'm here now... Thank god you're alright. 
Ben comforts her, holding her tightly with all his strength. 
AMY We can't stay here, we have to leave the house now... We can go to my mother's or to a hotel...

The windowpanes and picture frames have been wrapped securely with newspaper and tape. 
Every inch of reflective surface in the house, such as the TV- screen and the shiny taps, have been "neutralized" with strips of masking tape...

The young man looks at Ben questioningly. Apparently he has never heard the name before. 
JIMMY (to his mother inside) There's a man who's looking for... (back to Ben) You said Anna? (Ben confirms) Anna Esseker, Mom! 
Jimmy's mother, in her fifties, an obese woman who has trouble moving around- shows up in the opening of the door -

101   INT. DAY - FARMHOUSE BASEMENT                                101 
We are in the dark basement, under the farmhouse. The door to the first floor opens, letting the light in. Ben appears next to the silhouette of an old man- ROBERT ESSEKER, 80 years old, Anna's elder brother. 
Robert walks down the steps, signaling Ben to follow him- 
ROBERT You know, up to this day, the visions of Anna's fits still haunt me at night. 
They walk through the basement towards an old wooden door. 
ROBERT (CONT'D) I helped my father fix up this part of the basement, especially for her- 
The old man turns the key in the padlock. Slowly, the door swings open, revealing- 
ROBERT (CONT'D) Her fits were too violent. My mother couldn't take her screams anymore. 
What's left of a very primitive child's room, SURROUNDED BY DOUBLE WIRE FENCING AND IRON BARS. Rather than a cell, it more resembles a HUMAN-SIZED CAGE, CAPABLE OF RESISTING THE MOST FEROCIOUS BEAST. 
As he's talking, images flash on screen- painful memories from that time come back to him- 
Anna being carried to the basement, her innocent eyes full of hate. It's even hard to recognize the face of a little girl. Her howling screams. Her nails digging into her own flesh. Her unnatural strength and the violent thrashing of her arms and legs.

ROBERT (CONT'D) We had every priest, doctor, healer, coming from all over the state, one after the other. But no one could help her. 
Ben comes closer to the iron bars of the cage. He can see Anna's scratch marks next to the bed, giving his imagination a taste of her plight and suffering. 
ROBERT (CONT'D) Finally, Dr. Kane from New York answered my parents' cry for help. He rejected the idea of demonic possession, said he didn't believe in it. He was convinced that Anna suffered from a rare form of personality disorder. He wanted Anna under his care, at St. John's. My parents were very poor, but he agreed to cover all the hospital costs... In less than five months, Dr. Kane had cured Anna. It was unbelievable. She was her old self again. A real miracle of science. 
BEN And after the hospital? 
ROBERT You don't know? She died there with all of Kane's other patients. 
Ben takes the old release form out of his pocket and shows it to Robert. 
BEN Anna left the hospital two days before the massacre. Kane changed the records to make her disappear. 
ROBERT You're not a journalist, are you? What do you want? 
BEN I want to know. After St. John's, where did she go? 
Robert stares at Ben, unsure of saying what he's about to reveal to this perfect stranger- 
ROBERT Anna came back to live with us for a while...

BEN For a while? 
Robert lowers his eyes. 
BEN (CONT'D) And after? Why did she leave? 
ROBERT Because... Because strange things started to happen in the house... 
BEN With Anna? 
ROBERT No, not with Anna... 
The old man obviously doesn't want to get into the details. The memories are too painful. 
BEN With the mirrors? 
Robert stiffens, eyeing Ben with a dark look- How does he know? 
BEN (CONT'D) Mr. Esseker, tell me where I can find your sister. It's very important. It's a matter of life and death. 
SISTER ANNA St. John's closed down in 1952. Who are you? 
Ben sits down. Even at a short distance he cannot discern the face of Anna Esseker, who is now Sister Anna. 
BEN My name is Benjamin Carson. I work as a night watchman at 1229 West 38th Street in New York City, what used to be St. John's Hospital. 
SISTER ANNA What is it you want Mr. Carson? 
BEN I need your help. 
SISTER ANNA My help? I don't quite see how I could possibly be of any help. 
BEN My wife and children are in danger. What is threatening my family is asking for you... 
For a split second, Ben makes eye contact with Anna behind the screen. She has understood... 
BEN (CONT'D) If you don't help me I may lose the only thing that matters to me. 
SISTER ANNA I cannot leave the precincts. It's impossible. 
BEN Tell me why are the mirrors from the old hospital so determined to find you? 
Sister Anna remains silent- 
BEN (CONT'D) I must know, Sister. 
SISTER ANNA It is not the wish of the mirrors to find me, but of what is imprisoned inside them. The mirrors are merely windows on our world...

BEN A window... For what? For whom? 
ANNA At the time that I was at St. John's, Dr. Kane's therapy for personality disorders consisted of locking the patient up in a mirrored room for several days on end, in order to force him to confront his own image. I spent the darkest days of my life in that room. On the 6th day the nurses found me lifeless, almost dead. Since that day, I have never had another fit. But deep down inside I've always known the truth. 
BEN What truth? 
ANNA There is no cure for schizophrenia, it was something else, Mr. Carson. And whatever it was, it entered the mirror. 
We can feel the emotion in her voice. 
ANNA (CONT'D) I thought that after fifty years, this would have all gone away. They would have disappeared from the mirrors. I didn't know.... I'm sorry but if I agree to go with you and return to that place, I will make it possible for them to cross the threshold back into the real world. 
Everything is now making sense for Ben- 
BEN It entered with you and they need you to get out. 
ANNA The consequences of such an act, Mr. Carson, would be more devastating than letting them suffer where they are now. I'm going to pray for you and your family. That's all I can do right now, Mr. Carson. God bless you... 
She stands to leave. 
(CONTINUED) 
107A CONTINUED: (3)                                               107A 
BEN Wait... Please, listen to me- Terence Berry, Gary Lewis and many others before me... Those are the people who died trying to find you. Because they failed, their families died too. My sister was murdered two days ago... My wife and kids will next if you don't come with me. Look- 
From his wallet Ben takes out a wrinkled photograph of Michael, as a baby, in Amy's arms. Daisy stands next to them in the picture. Ben presses the photograph against the grating for Anna to look at it. 
BEN (CONT'D) My wife and two children. They're all I've got. They're innocent... Please. 
Anna stays quiet a moment behind the screen and leaves. 
BEN (CONT'D) I KNOW YOU ARE SCARED OF GOING BACK THERE. IT'S EASIER TO KEEP HIDING BUT THIS IS NOT THE HOUSE OF GOD ANYMORE. WHILE YOU'RE PRAYING PEOPLE ARE DYING ON YOUR TIME! 
Anna doesn't respond and disappears in the distance. 
Ben failed. He's desperate and lost. He has a hard time containing his anger. 
105   EXT. DAY - MONASTERY                                         105 
On the horizon, a red sun sets behind the treetops. It's almost nightfall. 
The bells from the monastery begin to toll. 
The cross above the monastery reflects upside down in a puddle of rain water. 
Frustrated, Ben walks back to his car and dials his home number on his cell phone - 
106   EXT. NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE                                 106 
In the distance, the lights of Manhattan sparkle in the night. 
In the house, all the lights are off. 
All is quiet, too quiet. 
108   INT. NIGHT - HALLWAY                                             108 
In the hallway, the shiny doorknob leading to Amy's bedroom is the only reflecting surface that has been forgotten. 
In the distorted reflection, we see Michael's silhouette approaching. The little boy reaches for the knob but- 
IN REALITY, NO HAND TOUCHES IT- 
At the bottom of the stairs, Amy catches sight of Michael at the other end of the living room. 
(CONTINUED) 
117   CONTINUED:                                                   117 
The first floor is completely flooded. ALL THE SPACE IS COVERED BY A THIN LAYER OF WATER THAT'S MIRRORING EVERYTHING IN HOUSE. 
The little boy has climbed up onto a stool and is scraping the paint off the mirror with a sharp knife... It was Michael who had scraped all the mirrors in the house in order to set the force of the mirrors free. 
AMY (CONT'D) Michael ! 
He doesn't answer. He doesn't seem to hear her. 
Amy comes down the last step. 
AMY (CONT'D) Michael ? What are you doing? 
The little boy turns around towards his mother with a big smile- 
IN THE MIRROR, HIS REFLECTION REMAINS FACING THEM. 
MICHAEL They want to come play with us, Mommy. 
Amy moves slowly towards her son. 
AMY Michael, I want you to drop that knife, do you hear me? You know very well you are not allowed to play with that, don't you? 
Michael looks at her in confusion and steps down from the stool. 
AMY (CONT'D) That's a good boy, now give me the knife... 
Instead of obeying, Michael runs off and disappears into another room on the first floor. 
AMY (CONT'D) MICHAEL ! 
Amy rushes after him. 
118   INT. NIGHT - BEDROOM                                         118 
Amy's cell phone, laying on the night table, begins to ring. On the display we can see the call is from Ben. 
Through the wooden slats of the closet door, Daisy catches sight of the phone. 
(CONTINUED) 
118   CONTINUED:                                                      118 
She thinks about leaving the closet to answer, but remembers her mother's strict instructions about staying in the hiding place. 
The phone continues to ring, but no one answer it. 
119   INT. NIGHT - FIRST FLOOR                                         119 
Amy hears the phone ringing upstairs, but she cannot answer it now- She must find Michael first. 
CUT TO : 
120   EXT/INT. NIGHT - BEN'S CAR - MANHATTAN                           120 
Ben's car drives down a Manhattan street. 
Behind the wheel, Ben is on the phone and gets Amy's voicemail. He dials again- 
BEN Answer! God damn it... Answer the phone... 
Once again he gets the voicemail. 
BEN (CONT'D) Fuck... 
Ben is losing his calm. 
121   EXT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER DEPARTMENT STORE                          121 
Ben's car pulls up in front of the department store. Through the windshield, Anna catches sight of the devastated building. 
Ben hangs up the phone- 
BEN Something's wrong over there, my wife is not answering. 
Ben is torn - He knows that going back to Amy isn't going to help- 
BEN (CONT'D) We have to get inside the Mayflower now. 
Anna steps out. She cannot conceal the sudden shiver that runs through her when she stands in front of the former hospital- 
ANNA From now on, I'm going to close my eyes. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
121   CONTINUED:                                                  121 ANNA (CONT'D) Take me to the basement, to the mirror room. It has to stop where it began... 
Ben grabs her forcefully- 
BEN Come on, let's go. 
ANNA You stay outside... 
Anna steps over the rubble as she feels her way into the mirror room. 
IN ALL THE MIRRORS IT'S NOT ANNA THE NUN, BUT ANNA THE LITTLE GIRL THAT WE CAN SEE- 
When she places her hand against one of the mirrors, cracks appear instantly. The pressure on the other side is growing stronger and stronger. 
(CONTINUED) 
125   CONTINUED:                                                 125 
Anna positions herself in the center of the room, from where her reflection is multiplied to infinity from all the possible angles. 
She kneels down with her eyes closed. 
CUT TO : 
126   INT. NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE                                 126 
Compared to the gloom of the basement in the department store, the second floor of the house seems to be bathed in light. 
Michael is sitting quietly in front of his room. As Narcissus did, he is observing his reflection, mirrored in the surface of the water that covers the wooden floor. 
AMY Michael ? 
Hypnotized by his mirror image, the little boy does not hear his mother's call. 
Amy appears at the top of the stairs and catches sight of him. 
AMY (CONT'D) Michael... Michael, look at me... I'm right here. 
Michael doesn't answer. Gently, he caresses his reflection in the surface of the water. 
Amy comes up to him slowly, determined to pull him away from his reflection... 
She lays her hand on his shoulder. 
This time Michael reacts and turns towards her. 
Before he can utter a single word- 
THE REFLECTION OF THE HAND BECOMES REAL, GRABBING THE CHILD'S WRISTS. MICHAEL'S REFLECTION PULLS HIM THROUGH ITS SURFACE. MICHAEL DISAPPEARS INTO THE FLOOR. 
Amy throws herself to the ground in an attempt to catch him. Too late, the little boy has been submerged in the thin layer of water covering the floor. MICHAEL HAS BEEN PULLED INTO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR! 
Amy sees her son struggling under the water, as if he were caught under a coat of ice. 
AMY (CONT'D) Michael, Michael... No, no... 
(CONTINUED) 
126   CONTINUED:                                                   126 
In desperation, Amy beats her fists against the floor with all her strength, trying to break through to the other side. 
AMY (CONT'D) MICHAEL !! NOOOOO... 
Flying into a rage, she beats her fists again and again in an attempt to break the surface and save Michael from drowning. 
She sees Michael's body sinking into the depths... 
CUT TO : 
127   INT. NIGHT - MIRROR ROOM                                      127 
Back to the subterranean world of the department store. 
Ben is waiting in the corridor with his gun in hand. 
In the mirror room, Anna recites a prayer for strength. IN THE REFLECTION, YOUNG ANNA IS DOING THE SAME... 
The mirrors around her shake more and more violently- 
Anna remains with her eyes still shut. 
Ben sees cracks forming on the walls and the surface of the water at his feet trembling... 
127A INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER                                        127A 
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING IN THE REST OF THE STORE AS WELL- ON EACH FLOOR, IN EVERY DEPARTMENT, ALL THE MIRRORS BEGIN TO VIBRATE UNCONTROLLABLY, TO TWIST OUT OF SHAPE, TO SWELL, TO SHRIVEL AND FINALLY- 
127B BACK IN THE MIRROR ROOM                                       127B 
ANNA OPENS HER EYES- 
ALL THE MIRRORS EXPLODE! 
FROM ONE AREA TO THE NEXT IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE, THE EXPLOSIONS ARE SPECTACULAR AND APOCALYPTIC. 
Anna's eyes freeze- her pupils constrict- thousands of shards of glass are sent flying into the air, piercing through her body like a dozen sharpened daggers. 
The blow of the explosion causes the walls to tremble. Instinctively, Ben takes shelter behind the wall. 
CUT TO : 
With his bloodied face, Ben is no longer the same man anymore- Something in his eyes has shifted. Rage and violence have replaced the terror and dread. He is determined to put an end to the creature, no matter what happens. 
He slides the weapon in his belt and steps, with his bare hands, towards what once was "Anna"... 
Crouched over in the water, the demon looks up, ready to charge. Ben takes another step forward with the same determination. The creature thrusts itself against him- 
THE CLASH IS EXTREMELY VIOLENT. Ben uses all his strength to keep his assailant's jaw at a distance. 
In a swift movement, Ben turns around AND IMPALES "ANNA" ON THE BROKEN GAS PIPE! 
IN A GUSH OF BLOOD THE SHARP METAL TIP PIERCES THROUGH HER STOMACH BUT- 
Despite being momentarily immobilised, the demon seems unaffected by the near total destruction of its outer shell. On the contrary, it struggles more violently to escape from the trap. 
Ben moves away, keeping an eye on "Anna". He takes his gun and aims it at her. Ben is exhausted. With his arm outstretched, he is ready to shoot, waiting for the right moment. 
The silhouette suddenly emerges from the dark. 
Ben stands by- 
The demon goes through the cloud of gas- Ben fires- 
THE EXPLOSION IS INSTANTANEOUS. "ANNA" IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THE FIRE SPREADS THROUGH THE TUNNELS. 
Ben throws himself to the ground to avoid the flames. 
(CONTINUED) 
129   CONTINUED: (3)                                                129 
SUDDENLY, IN A DOMINO EFFECT, ONE EXPLOSION FOLLOWS THE OTHER. A BLAST OCCURS A BIT FURTHER DOWN THE TUNNEL, AND ANOTHER INSIDE THE WALLS. 
THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAYS ARE ABOUT TO COLLAPSE- 
Cracks appear everywhere. The brick walls begin to fall apart. 
A part of the ceiling at the far end of the corridor caves in. 
Ben gets back on his feet and dashes for the stairs. 
Totally burnt, flesh charred, "Anna" is enraged by her prey's resistance. The blazing demon runs after Ben. 
Behind them, one after the other, sections of the walls collapse. 
Ben runs as fast as he can. 
"Anna" is coming closer to him, when suddenly - 
JUST BEHIND BEN, A SECTION OF THE GROUND FLOOR CAVES IN, BURYING HER UNDER A MASS OF RUBBLE. 
Ben narrowly escaped the collapse. He reaches the staircase and catches sight of the exit above when suddenly- 
THE ENTIRE FOUNDATION OF THE BUILDING COLLAPSES OVER HIM. 
Ben finds himself crushed along the floor and penetrates the mirroring water surface DISAPPEARING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR. 
129A INT. NIGHT - JERSEY HOUSE                                     129A 
All of her efforts are in vain. Amy is unable to bring back her son. 
Nonetheless, she continues with the same determination, refusing to accept reality. 
She finally breaks down, pleading with the sky above... 
129B THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR                                  129B 
Lost and floating in this strange and unfamiliar place, Ben turns and sees Michael's body/soul which is also trapped in this parallel dimension, on the other side of the mirror. 
In the distance, he can see the surface leading to the hallway of the New Jersey house. Above it, Amy tries to resuscitate Michael. 
(CONTINUED) 
129B CONTINUED:                                                 129B 
Ben grabs his son and holds him tightly in his arms for a moment, then pushes him towards the surface- 
THE CHILD OPENS HIS EYES!- 
130   INT. NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE                                130 
MICHAEL COMES AROUND, COUGHING OUT THE WATER FROM HIS LUNGS. Amy bursts into tears, sobbing with joy. She holds him tightly in her arms, with all her strength, with all her love. 
Holding Michael in her arms, Amy comes back for Daisy in the bedroom. She opens the closet door and finds her little girl inside. The child throws herself into her mother's arms- 
DAISY It is over, Mom? 
Amy throws a glance at her reflection in the mirror. Everything seems back to normal. 
AMY Yes sweetheart, it's over... 
Amy holds her two children tightly, savoring this moment of joy and relief. 
Through the window, we see the first light of dawn appearing on the horizon. 
131   INT. DAWN - MAYFLOWER                                       131

1   INT. SUV -- DAY                                                 1 
No sound. We are in a speeding SUV. The passenger, LARA, unsnaps her seat belt and reaches for the door handle. The driver, JOHN, sees her door open and dives to GRAB her. The SUV spins, HORNS BLARE, TIRES SCREECH, cars swerve to avoid collision. We aren't sure what is happening, but we know something has gone terribly wrong. Cut to BLACK. Read: 
THE LAST THREE YEARS 
2   INT. STEAK HOUSE -- NIGHT                                       2 
Two couples sit at a table, picking at dessert, JOHN and LARA BRENNAN on one side, MICK and ERIT on the other. JOHN is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a kid with a discipline problem. You have to really know him to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you. He is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd. LARA looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit. She appears to have had a hard day at the office. She's been drinking at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves. John's good-looking brother, MICK, boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous, if slightly trashy, girlfriend, ERIT, who isn't ashamed of her body or sharing her opinions. JOHN and MICK are laughing. Lara puts cash on the tray beside Mick's credit card. 
LARA You know what? If you were smart you would stop talking right now. 
ERIT Sue me. I just know that women should never work for women. 
John laughs and applauds.   Mick buries his head. 
LARA How can you say that?? 
ERIT They're always threatened. Especially if you're beautiful and they're not. 
LARA Erit, you are so full of shit. 
ERIT So, your boss isn't threatened by you? 
(CONTINUED) 
2   CONTINUED:                                                       2 
LARA Because she's a bitch! -- (as John and Mick laugh) --Not because she's a woman. 
ERIT And you would describe her as "attractive"? 
LARA That has nothing to do with it! 
ERIT And there is my answer. 
JOHN Either of you like another drink? 
Lara shoots John a burning look as Erit builds on her victory. 
ERIT Women should work under men, men under women. That's it. 
JOHN (egging her on) But men under men? 
ERIT That's fine, too. (the men burst into laughter) They're used to it! Why are you laughing? 
MICK (re: Erit) I don't know, bro, but I think I'd rather work under you than her. 
ERIT (insulted, shoots back) Oh please, I'd rather work under him, too. 
That was a dig at Mick but Lara is primed for a fight. 
LARA You'd rather "work under" John? 
ERIT You have a problem with that, too? 
(CONTINUED) 
2   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                   2 
LARA No, why would I have a problem with your little sexual innuendo? 
ERIT What is up your ass tonight?? 
Mick throws John a "This is all your fault and now it is going to explode" look. John feigns complete innocence. 
LARA So, I shouldn't take offense that you're coming on to my husband right in front of me. 
ERIT (claws out now) Lara, if I wanted your husband I would have him. 
LARA How? You couldn't possibly show him more of your tits. 
The men are on their feet before blows are exchanged. 
ERIT -- You know what your problem is?! 
JOHN                             MICK That was a great meal!           Okay--okay! 
3   EXT. STEAK HOUSE PARKING LOT -- NIGHT                               3 
Mick and Erit head toward Mick's sporty pickup.     John and Lara step into foreground, Lara still fuming. 
JOHN She is completely full of shit. 
LARA DON'T try and agree with me now. 
JOHN You know what? I don't even believe she is in the dental profession. 
Lara knows this game; he is trying to get her out of her black mood, and she has no intention of letting him. 
LARA Shut up. 
(CONTINUED) 
JOHN Three, and I have papers to grade. Can you pick up Luke? 
LARA After yesterday I probably don't have a job anyway. Do you think it was wrong to call her a useless cow? 
(CONTINUED) 
9    CONTINUED:    (2)                                               9 
JOHN Bosses admire that kind of frank exchange. 
LARA (pulls note off fridge) Did you call your father? 
JOHN When? 
LARA (heading for bathroom) "When?" Yesterday, for his birthday! 
10   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BATHROOM                                   10 
Lara puts her foot up and jabs herself with insulin. 
JOHN (O.S.) I sent him flowers and a handmade card. 
LARA You're completely impossible. 
JOHN (O.S.) Did you notice what I got for my birthday this year? A grunt. 
11   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN                                    11 
JOHN Mom said Happy Birthday and my father went . Made me tear up. 
Lara returns, trying hard not to smile. 
LARA Ever think that someone has to be the bigger person here? 
JOHN (to Luke) Remember this for the custody hearing: how Mommy is always scolding Daddy. 
LARA How are you going to feel if Luke grows up and doesn't call you? 
Lara can't keep a straight face and heads to the foyer. 
(CONTINUED) 
11   CONTINUED:                                                        11 
JOHN Now she's driving a wedge between us. 
LARA I give up. 
JOHN And now she is abandoning you. 
Lara grabs her raincoat and notices a stain on the back shoulder. Irritated, she heads back to the bathroom. 
12   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM                          12 
Lara rinses the stain under the sink, surprised to see it run red. She looks at her hands: blood. The doorbell rings. 
13   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN                                      13 
John rises to answer the door. 
14   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM                          14 
Lara looks at her coat, wonders how the hell she got blood on her shoulder. She rubs liquid soap into it. 
15   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER                                        15 
As John opens the door, DETECTIVE QUINN shows his badge. DETECTIVE COLLERO and a team of detectives push past. John has no time to react. 
DETECTIVE QUINN Police.   Mr. Brennan? 
LUKE sees the police rush past him and gets scared. 
DETECTIVE QUINN (CONT'D) My name is Detective Quinn. This is a search warrant for these premises. 
John hears Luke cry and instinctively heads inside. 
DETECTIVE QUINN (CONT'D) (stops him) Stay where you are. 
JOHN Get your -- 
DETECTIVE QUINN Touch me again and you'll be arrested. 
16   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWN THE HALL                                  16 
Lara steps from the bathroom and is met by Detective Collero. She sees the coat with the water spot; nods to a team member, who takes it and bags it under: 
DETECTIVE COLLERO Lara Brennan? 
LARA WHAT?! 
DETECTIVE COLLERO Lara Brennan, you are under arrest for the murder of Elizabeth Gesas. 
She takes her wrist and professionally turns and cuffs her. 
LARA She's dead??     Elizabeth is dead?? 
17   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER                                          17 
JOHN (tries to push past) She didn't do anything! 
DETECTIVE QUINN I will only -- 
JOHN (tries again) She didn't do anything! 
JOHN Every night at bedtime. 
LARA What are you building?    A fort? 
Lara pulls him into a hug; no response. She kisses his head and sits at the table with John. She squeezes his hand. 
LARA (CONT'D) Was he scared going to school? 
JOHN I walked him to class, gave him a kiss; he didn't even look back to wave. 
LARA What did you make him for lunch? 
(CONTINUED) 
24   CONTINUED:                                                       24 
JOHN Turkey sandwich, just butter and bread, no "vegetables" on it. He swore he ate his apple. 
He hands her a pack of photos.      Lara devours them. 
LARA Look at his friends.   And his desk. This is his teacher? 
JOHN Miss Phillips. 
LARA You may have to move to another school district. 
JOHN Already spoke to a realtor. 
LARA (still looking at photos) How was your first day? 
JOHN Excellent. Over half my class stayed awake. Talked to your mom. 
LARA When is she coming? 
JOHN She's having a lot of trouble with her business. 
LARA It's only been a couple of years, I'm sure she'll get around to it. (beat) Have you heard anything? 
JOHN About the appeal? Yes, and I'm just not telling you. What did Meyer say? 
LARA --Don't-- 
JOHN -- It can take months for the court to rule. 
(CONTINUED) 
24   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 24 
LARA I saw that woman. She was there. She couldn't have just disappeared. 
JOHN Meyer's looking for a new investigator. 
LARA Her coat snagged my purse, I felt a button pop - they must have been blind not to find it. 
JOHN He'll go through all the evidence again. 
LARA Great, because I haven't quite bankrupted us yet. 
JOHN We're doing fine. 
LARA (fondly) You just lie and lie. (strokes his face) But you are very handsome. (admiring him) Can you do me a favor? 
JOHN I don't know, I'm a little busy. 
LARA I need you to run for governor. 
JOHN -- Oh, that I can do. 
LARA You can change this rule about no conjugal visits, because I don't think I can last another twenty years. 
She smiles but is already traveling toward a dark place.    He reaches out and holds her tight, stroking her back. 
LARA (CONT'D) I'm okay.   I'm okay. 
(CONTINUED) 
24   CONTINUED:    (3)                                               24 
JOHN I know. But it's going to be fine. I promise. 
She just stares at Luke, his back to them, playing. 
LARA You think he'll ever want to kiss me again? 
25   INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- LATER               25 
The prisoners file out and are patted down. Lara turns and blows Luke and John a kiss. They watch with the other visitors, who all stand on the far side of the room. 
26   INT. COUNTY JAIL - CHANGING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER               26 
Lara and the female inmates pull off their visiting jump- suits and hand them to a female guard, who searches them for contraband. Lara retrieves her regular jump-suit and pulls it on over her underwear. Another small, daily humiliation. 
27   INT. JOHN'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT                                   27 
Start VERY CLOSE ON JOHN'S DIGITAL WATCH. Widen to see Luke standing on a low step at the sink in his pajamas using a complicated-looking electric toothbrush. John sits on the toilet, staring at his watch. 
JOHN Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty. 
Luke puts it down and checks his teeth in the mirror. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Good? 
Luke nods. 
MEYER That it no longer matters what we believe; Lara's not getting out. And you have no idea how much I hate saying that. 
JOHN (exiting) I'll find someone to file the pleadings. 
(CONTINUED) 
31   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                   31 
MEYER John! Come on! For Christ's sake. JOHN!! 
John is long gone.    Meyer hurls his sandwich into the trash. 
32   INT. COUNTY JAIL - VISITING BOOTHS -- DAY                           32 
John waits alone on the visitors' side of the glass. The door opens, and Lara steps up on the other side. John smiles and picks up the phone, but Lara sees something in his face and doesn't pick up her phone, just stares at him. 
John fights to keep his smile and nods for her to pick up her phone -- but now she can see the verdict chiseled on his face. Lara gasps and cries inconsolably. 
John keeps the smile plastered on his face, but now tears run down his cheeks. He taps on the glass and points at her phone, but she doesn't respond. He taps harder and harder -- desperately wanting to comfort her, but she won't allow it. 
He bangs on the glass with his fist, drawing the attention of the guard on his side. 
Lara turns and exits. John stands and yells her name, but she can't hear it, and neither can we. 
33   EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY                                33 
We're in an old working class neighborhood.    John sits in his car, trying to pull himself together. 
34   INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY                                34 
MICK opens the door. GRACE, their mother, looks up from clearing the lunch dishes. John's face tells them everything they need to know. Mick slams his fist against the door. 
In the back yard with Luke, GEORGE, John's father turns to see Grace tearfully embrace John. George looks away, uncomfortable, and distracts Luke's attention. 
35   EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE - BACK YARD -- LATE AFTERNOON         35 
John, Mick and Grace sit in the worn wicker chairs on the back porch. Erit steps out with beers to replace their empties. She sits and they stare off, watching Luke and George play with the dog. After a moment Erit looks to John: 
ERIT I know you won't want to hear this... 
(CONTINUED) 
35   CONTINUED:                                                       35 
MICK -- Erit, go put somebody to sleep. 
She stares unbelieving, then walks off in a huff. 
JOHN Thanks. 
MICK Had to be done. (long beat) I am really going to pay for that. 
John has to smile. 
36   EXT. THE HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT (DUSK)                           36 
John drives through a rough part of town on their way home. He stops at a light and notes the dealers on the corner. A flashy car pulls up, hands are slapped; call the driver DAVID. He takes a roll of cash from the dealer, looks around, catches John staring. John looks away quickly and drives off. 
37   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                     37 
John sits at his desk, surrounded by boxes of documents and photographs. As John sifts through the evidence... 
38   INT. LARA'S OFFICE - THE PAST -- NIGHT                           38 
Lara and her boss ELIZABETH argue loudly. 
39   EXT. PARKING GARAGE - THE PAST -- NIGHT                          39 
It's RAINING outside. ELIZABETH stands at her car door in a small, partially covered garage -- maybe a dozen spots. She turns toward camera -- 
A FIRE EXTINGUISHER comes right at camera, making a terrible impact and 
ELIZABETH collapses to the floor. 
40   EXT. PARKING GARAGE - THE PAST -- NIGHT                          40 
Lara turns, holding the fire extinguisher. 
41   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS                                41 
As he flips through a handwritten witness statement. 
42   EXT. PARKING LOT - THE PAST -- NIGHT                            42 
Lara's car speeds out of the parking lot. A male co-worker steps out of the rain just as her car passes. He stops as he sees ELIZABETH'S BODY lying beside her car. 
43   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BATHROOM - THE PAST -- DAY                 43 
Lara tries to scrub the blood off of her coat. 
44   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                    44 
The phone beside him SHRIEKS.   John picks it up. 
45   EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ENTRANCE -- NIGHT          45 
It's late; prime time for the ER.    John runs in. 
46   INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - SEVENTH FLOOR -- NIGHT               46 
John enters breathlessly and finds the Nurses' Station. 
JOHN Lara Brennan; my wife. She was sent up here. Brennan. B-R- 
And then a female hand appears beside him, opens another drawer and reaches in. John stares at the hand, afraid to move, afraid to look up. The hand finds a tube of glue, places it on the counter and moves away. 
John turns to see LARA walking away. She turns, smiling and shaking her head, and disappears into the dining room. 
Stunned, John looks down at the glue on the counter, then suddenly pushes away and rushes into the dining room. No sign of her. And she isn't in the living room. He bolts into the foyer and finds the front door slightly ajar. He flings it open... 
52   EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT                                       52 
John rushes out into the street, looking up and down for her -- finally realizing she was never there. 
(CONTINUED) 
52   CONTINUED:                                                         52 
He stands in the middle of the street, now searching for some way to survive. 
53   INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - JOHN'S CLASSROOM -- DAY                   53 
Don Quixote is written on the chalkboard. 
JOHN So, what is it about?   Julie? 
JULIE That belief in someone's virtue is more important than virtue itself? 
JOHN No. I mean, yes, that's in there. But what is it about? 
No takers. 
JOHN (CONT'D) It is about how rational thought destroys the soul. It is about the triumph of irrationality, and the power that is in it. 
54   INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - LIBRARY -- DAY                            54 
John drops an armload of books into a library cart, each having something to do with prison or prison life. 
He sits at a table at the back, flipping through them one at a time and discards each in turn. 
As the shadows grow longer we find him staring at the computer screen linked to the school system. 
ON THE SCREEN: a book summary disappears, to be replaced by the school search engine -- many of the items have already been inspected. John finds one that reads "Over The Walls." 
He clicks on the link and the title page appears. The author is DAMON PENNINGTON. There's a photo of him. The caption reads that he LIVES IN BROOKLYN, NY. 
55   EXT. BROOKLYN, NEW YORK - STREET -- DAY                            55 
John gets out of a cab and heads into a local dive bar. 
56   INT. BAR -- DAY                                                    56 
A couple of guys at the bar yell at the dog race on the TV screen. DAMON hands John a beer and nods toward a table. 
(CONTINUED) 
56   CONTINUED:                                                          56 
JOHN It's a course that investigates what drives men to be free, no matter the cost. 
DAMON Somebody else had dibs on Papillon? 
JOHN You escaped from jail seven times. 
Damon lights a cigarette.       A TOUGH GUY nearby objects. 
TOUGH GUY No smoking!! 
DAMON Yeah, who would want to cut short your precious life? 
Damon takes a deep drag. 
JOHN Mind if I tape you? 
DAMON Go for it, it can't be used as evidence. What do you want to know? 
John sets up the small digital recorder. 
JOHN How you escaped when no one else could. 
DAMON Balls and a little luck. (beat) No prison in the world is airtight. Each one has a key. You have to find it. 
JOHN How do you do that? 
DAMON A lot of looking. Especially at things that break the daily routine. Guards get comfortable doing the same thing every day. Something happens where they have to think, adapt. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
56   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 56 
DAMON (CONT'D) That's when they will make mistakes. But when you see it you have to be ready. You have to have the entire plan already in place before you even know how you are going to get out of the jail. Escaping is easy; the hardest part is staying free. 
57   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                      57 
The tape recorder plays Damon's voice; John tears large sheets of art paper from a pad and tacks them to his bedroom wall. 
DAMON (O.S.) You have to know where you are going to go and how you are going to get there. You have to know how they plan to catch you, where, and when. 
JOHN (O.S.) How the hell do you know that? 
He starts to write on the paper with a large felt marker. 
DAMON (O.S.) You pay off someone who knows. And a lot depends on if the prison is in the country or the city. 
58   INT. BAR -- DAY                                                   58 
JOHN The city. 
96   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON                            96 
John uses Photoshop, looking through family pictures for an appropriate one to use for Lara's ID. Some of them are of the family at a cottage. He finds one that will work and starts to crop himself and Luke (as a baby) out of the photo. Then he turns and notices Luke standing behind him, staring at the screen. 
97   EXT. PITTSBURGH -- DAY                                           97 
A helicopter swoops over a bridge and traces the Monongahela River through the city. On the door of the helicopter is emblazoned the name of a local tour company. 
98   INT. HELICOPTER -- DAY                                           98 
John sits among six other passengers. 
COPTER PILOT On the left, Allegheny County Jail. Built in 1995, it is now the largest jail in the world. There have been three escape attempts. No one's made it out alive. On your right... 
Everyone else looks to the right as the pilot continues. John stays fixed on the left window. 
HIS POINT OF VIEW: 
The massive rooftops of the jail. But then he sees exactly what he is looking for: workmen wearing yellow helmets spread hot tar and roofing paper. He spots a workman carrying a bucket heading around a tall outcropping on the roof. 
99    INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - CLASSROOM -- DAY                          99 
LYLA, a student, reads from The Idiot as John returns to his desk with papers in his hands. His laptop lies open to Google Earth -- the rooftop view of the jail, from another angle. John closes it and spreads the papers on his desk -- a printed color version of the same. He draws an arrow to the outcropping where we now see a door; labels it ELEVATOR. 
LYLA On the first landing, which was as small as the necessary turn of the stairs allowed, there was a niche in the column, about a yard wide, and in this niche the prince felt convinced that a man stood concealed. He thought he could distinguish a figure standing there. 
100   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY                                         100 
John searches Craigslist for HELICOPTER PILOTS. Clicks on one that reads EXPERIENCED HELICOPTER PILOT, COMBAT VET, WILL CONSIDER ANY OFFER. 
ANGLE ON JOHN'S WALL 
Where a magazine clipping of a helicopter sits under the heading ESCAPE. Overlapping it he pins trimmed print-outs of several PILOT candidates. 
Directly underneath is the Google Earth photo of the rooftop of the jail, the door marked with an arrow, and the landing site indicated with an X in a circle. 
Below that is a rough sketch of the visitor's room and the adjacent corridor with an arrow marking the elevator. In block letters beside it is the word "KEY?" 
101   INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT                             101 
Luke, John and George stand in the foyer, Luke with his child- sized, brightly-colored overnight bag. John pulls off Luke's coat, kisses him on the head and looks up at George. 
JOHN Thanks. 
George nods, takes Luke's hand and walks to the kitchen. 
102   EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT                                      102 
John drives, taking note of the corners where young men hang out, selling drugs or contraband. 
103   EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT                                      103 
John walks up to a guy leaning on the bumper of his car, the trunk partially open. Call him MOUSS. 
JOHN Adderall? 
MOUSS Ten apiece, five for forty. 
John hands him a twenty, Mouss digs into a bag in his trunk and hands him a blister-pack strip of two pills, samples. 
JOHN I need some passports. 
MOUSS Piss off. 
John nods and walks back across the street.   The guy watches. 
104   INT. CAR -- NIGHT                                                104 
John climbs into his car and tosses the pills onto the passenger seat, among a half dozen others. There is a sharp RAP on his window; Mouss. John rolls down the window. 
MOUSS You have to pay up front. 
JOHN I can do that. 
MOUSS You know the Uptown on 5th Ave? 
JOHN No. 
MOUSS Ask for Harv. 
JOHN What's your name? 
MOUSS Just say Mouss. 
105   EXT. UPTOWN LOUNGE - 5TH AVENUE -- NIGHT                         105 
John parks and steps out of his car. 
106   INT. UPTOWN LOUNGE -- NIGHT                                      106 
Hip-hop blares, the clientele are low-lives, John doesn't exactly fit in as he enters and orders. His words are drowned out. The bartender gives him a beer on tap. John asks for "Hart." The bartender nods to a man at the back who is playing a video game. John walks off, passing a LONG-HAIRED GUY at the bar who watches him. John approaches HARV. 
JOHN Mouss said to come see you. 
HARV He did, did he? What do you want? 
JOHN Three passports, a driver's license, and real social security number. 
HARV How do you know Mouss? 
JOHN He babysits my kid. 
HARV (sizes him up, then:) Okay. 
John waits for the janitor to leave his tiny office and grabs the door before it closes. He slips inside and finds a rack with keys. He takes one from the hook marked ELEVATORS. 
138   INT. BRENNAN'S GARAGE -- NIGHT                                    138 
John files down the elevator key as he did the house key. 
139   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE -- DAY                                139 
John moves aside a box on the shelf and removes the handgun, wrapped in an old chamois. 
PAULA     (O.S.) John? 
He turns to see Paula standing in the open garage door. 
JOHN Hi. 
(CONTINUED) 
139   CONTINUED:                                                           139 
John tries to look casual as he stands with the thinly disguised gun in his hand. 
PAULA I was wondering if I could ask you to water my plants next week; I'm going in for an operation. 
JOHN I hope it's nothing serious. 
PAULA My idiot doctor misdiagnosed me. He's blaming the lab; the lab's blaming him. But I'll be fine. Thanks. 
And she walks off.    John gets in the car and slips the gun between the seats. 
140   INT. PRIUS -- DAY                                                    140 
John pulls into the empty parking lot beside Don's and waits. Checks his watch: 1:49 PM. A car pulls in. The guy sits there for a second, then gets out and enters the restaurant. 
141   INT. PRIUS -- DAY                                                    141 
John checks his watch. 2:14. He looks around, knowing he is supposed to leave. He makes a call. 
RECEPTIONIST (O.S.) English Department, this is Catherine. 
JOHN Hi. It's John. Luke isn't feeling well, I'm going to take him home. I need Carl to cover my 2:30 class. 
RECEPTIONIST (O.S.) I will let him know. 
142   INT. PRIUS - DON'S PARKING LOT - MANCHESTER -- AFTERNOON             142 
John checks his watch: 2:27. His cell phone rings, displays the name MICK; John presses IGNORE. He feels for the gun between the seats. 
143   EXT. DON'S PARKING LOT - MANCHESTER -- AFTERNOON                     143 
The guy comes out of the restaurant. John watches him walk to his car. The man sees him and stares back. John checks his watch. 2:45. The guy drives off, leaving the lot empty. 
(CONTINUED) 
143   CONTINUED:                                                          143 
John presses the VOICEMAIL button on his phone. 
MICK (V.O.) Are you ever going to answer your goddamn phone? 
Suddenly a man in a helmet raps on his side window and John realizes MIKE has pulled up without him noticing. His hand goes to the split between the seats, but stops short as the SECOND RIDER pulls up to the passenger window. 
MIKE You were supposed to leave. 
JOHN I need them. 
MIKE You notice that guy was a cop? 
JOHN Which guy? 
MIKE The one with the red light in his back window. 
John feels ridiculous.       Mike hands him the documents. 
MIKE (CONT'D) Just give me the money. 
John hands him the envelope of money.       Mike checks it. 
MIKE (CONT'D) You want this too much. You're going to fuck it up. 
Mike speeds off. The second rider gives John a look and follows. John looks over the passports with their new names. 
144   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE -- AFTERNOON                            144 
Luke gets out of the car and heads into the house, swinging his lunch pale. John watches him go, then reaches down beside his seat and pulls out the gun, wrapped in a cloth. He hides it in the garage and thinks about what he is doing. 
145   INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY                                145 
John moves through the line toward the metal detector. He takes his key ring out of his pocket and slips it, and the separate elevator bump key, into a white plastic dish and 
(CONTINUED) 
145   CONTINUED:                                                         145 
places it atop the X-ray machine. He steps through the metal detector and then grabs the plastic dish before the guard can get to it. He hands the dish to the guard. 
JOHN How are you doing today? 
GUARD Don't touch that. 
JOHN Sorry. 
John puts the dish down, and we see the bump key is gone -- John palmed it. The guard dumps John's key ring on the counter with the keys and cell phones from the other visitors. 
MICK (O.S.) Let me in, asshole!! 
153   EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -- CONTINUOUS                      153 
Mick bangs again. 
MICK (O.S.) Open up! (more banging) Your car is in the garage, I know you're in there! 
154   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS                                    154 
John doesn't move. As we pull back we see that the living room and dining room have been stripped of every bit of furniture, save an old TV set sitting on a box. John knows he can't let his brother see this. 
The MALE NEIGHBOR in the house to the south opens his door and looks out and scowls. 
MALE NEIGHBOR What's your problem? He's not home! 
MICK Not home?   So you're saying I'm blind? 
MALE NEIGHBOR No, I'm saying you're an idiot. 
(CONTINUED) 
154   CONTINUED:                                                             154 
Mick pounds on the door aggressively.      Then just gives up. 
MICK You know what? You're right.    I am an idiot. 
And he walks off to his car. 
155   EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS                                       155 
John leans back against the wall, in the middle of the bare room, and listens to his brother's car start and drive away. 
156   OMITTED                                                                156 AND                                                                          AND 
158   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- EVENING                                         158 
John stands, staring at his wall, now a vast collage, layer upon layer of photographs and notes. And no answers. 
LUKE (O.S.) ...Dad? 
159   EXT. PARK -- DAY                                                       159 
John sits on a bench, frustrated and lost.      Luke trots up. 
LUKE Can I have my cookies? 
JOHN You hungry?    You want your sandwich? 
LUKE No. 
John hands him two packaged cookies. Luke runs off and hands them to Carrie. Her attractive young mother, Nicole, sitting a couple of benches down, calls and draws John's attention. 
NICOLE Carrie! (to John) I'm sorry. She just already has it all figured out. (John nods awkwardly) Nicole. 
JOHN I remember. 
(CONTINUED) 
159   CONTINUED:                                                           159 
NICOLE (knows he doesn't) Really? 
JOHN (smiles and admits) I remember your daughter. 
NICOLE She's hard to forget. (digs in her bag) Oh, this is for you. Luke was supposed to bring it home. 
Hands him an envelope. He opens it and sees a birthday invitation with jungle animals on the cover. 
JOHN He has his father's memory. 
NICOLE It's for Carrie's birthday party. Please come; I'd love to meet your wife. 
JOHN I'm afraid she can't be there. ...It's complicated. 
NICOLE I understand. With me, too. Carrie, come on, time for lunch. (to John) We're going to the cafe on the corner, would you like to join us? 
JOHN Oh, we're pretty...you know.... 
NICOLE Busy? 
John smiles, busted. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) Come on, we owe you for the cookies. 
JOHN That's true.     And I made those cookies. 
NICOLE And learned how to pre-package them. 
(CONTINUED) 
159   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               159 
JOHN Which requires a considerable amount of machinery. Come on, Luke. 
They walk toward the street, the kids trailing behind. Neither John nor Nicole speak for a moment. 
NICOLE Do you trade off time with Luke? 
JOHN No. Luke and I are together full time. 
NICOLE Wow. I guess that's why I see you so much. 
(CONTINUED) 
189   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               189 
JOHN What do you want from me? 
LARA Nothing. You're too perfect already. You know you never even asked me if I did it. If I killed her. 
JOHN (stopped dead) Because I knew you didn't. 
LARA Then you'd be wrong. 
She leans forward and whispers in his ear. 
LARA (CONT'D) I grabbed the fire extinguisher. I hit her in the face. I heard her neck snap. You know why I did it? Because she pissed me off. I threw her purse in the river. We paid for dinner with the cash from her wallet. 
She sits back a bit to look in his face. Only now, looking in his eyes, a crack forms in her tough exterior. 
LARA (CONT'D) I'm sorry.   I'm actually very sorry. 
She stands. The guard opens the door and lets her into the changing room. John watches, unable to breathe. 
190   INT. COUNTY JAIL - CHANGING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                  190 
Lara gets one last look at John, through the glass, and then disappears behind the partition. She sits on the bench, leans her head between her knees, and breaks into shards. 
191   INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS                       191 
John exits along with all the other visitors, destroyed by what he has heard, playing out what she said in his head. Then suddenly he just stops. The crowd keeps moving, leaving him behind. The guard following the group sees him standing there. Commands him: 
GUARD #2 Sir, you cannot stand there. (beat) SIR, you need to exit the building NOW. 
192   INT. COUNTY JAIL - VISITING BOOTHS -- MOMENTS LATER                  192 
Lara takes a seat on her side of the glass partition.    She picks up her phone and opens her mouth to speak. 
JOHN Shut up. I don't care what you say or how you say it. I don't believe you did it and I never will. I know who you are. 
She opens her mouth to object but John slams the phone into the cradle. She pounds on the window. He just stares at her. Her eyes well up, and she smiles through her tears. 
193   INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER                         193 
John steps out and sees the MAJOR waiting with his keys. They exchange a look. 
JOHN Thank you. 
The Major nods and locks the door.    John heads out. 
194   INT. TOY SHOP -- DAY                                                 194 
Luke in his arms, John takes a My Little Pony off the shelf. 
JOHN You think? 
LUKE (already an expert) Girls love them. 
195   INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY                                 195 
Grace opens the door. George stands a few steps behind her, quiet. Grace sees John and is immediately concerned. 
JOHN Hi Mom. 
GRACE What are you doing here? 
JOHN I've got class. 
GRACE Five o'clock at night? 
(CONTINUED) 
195   CONTINUED:                                                          195 
JOHN Yes. (kisses Luke) Bye. 
Luke runs in as John walks off. 
196   EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS                         196 
John's father watches through the window as his son leaves. In his gut, George knows something is wrong. 
197   EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT                                         197 
John sits in his car down the street, watching the corner where he noticed kids selling drugs. 
A car shows up - the same flashy car he saw weeks ago. The street dealer looks around, runs to the window, makes an exchange, and then the car drives off again. John checks his watch and settles in to wait. 
198   EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT                                         198 
John watches as other cars drive up and score drugs. And then finally the flashy car cruises up again. John checks his watch: it has been two hours. Again the street dealer runs up and hands the driver an envelope. We recognize the driver -- he is the one from earlier, whom we are going to call DAVID. He drives away. John follows. 
199   EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT                                         199 
John follows the flashy car at a distance.    It stops at another corner and something is exchanged.    It drives on; John follows. 
200   EXT. HILL DISTRICT - NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT                          200 
Not the best part of town. It looks rough even for The Hill. The flashy car parks and David crosses the street. 
Half a block back, John turns left at the corner and then makes a quick right into the alley. He guesses how many houses from the corner David stopped, gets out and checks over the fences. 
He stops a few houses away when he sees the porch light on a house flick on. David waits on the dilapidated back porch. He waves to whoever is watching him through the pinhole and the light goes out again. 
(CONTINUED) WHITE    9-10-09                                                68. 
John catches Alex's eyes darting to the counter. Following his gaze he finds Alex's revolver on the counter. John grabs it, flips open the cylinder and spills out the cartridges. 
DAVID I can't kneel! 
JOHN On the floor! 
David kneels with great difficulty.         Alex calmly does as he's told, his eyes on John. 
(CONTINUED) 
203   CONTINUED:                                                          203 
John grabs the paper bag out of Alex's hand and opens it, finds a couple thousand in cash. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Where's the rest? 
DAVID That's twelve hundred dollars! (emptying his pockets) Here, take it. 
A couple of hundred dollars spill onto the floor. 
JOHN (gun on Alex) Where do you keep your money?! 
Alex scoffs, seeing weakness in John. 
ALEX Yeah, I'm going to give you my money. 
JOHN I'll shoot you! 
ALEX You won't even shoot a dog. 
JOHN Tell me! 
ALEX Shoot the floor again, impress me. 
John pistol-whips him and Alex goes down. John holds his gun to his head while he is on the ground bleeding. 
JOHN I'm going to kill you both. 
ALEX No, I'm going to kill you both. 
DAVID Give him your money! 
ALEX (to David) Keep your dead bitch mouth shut. 
Enraged, John fires a round into Alex's leg.      Alex screams. 
(CONTINUED) 
203   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                     203 
DAVID Stop it!! 
ALEX (smiles thru pain) See? You aren't going to kill me. That was the worst you can do. So, now you've done it. Go home. I'll come find you and kill you. 
John looks around desperately. He spots an open bottle of tequila in the clutter on the counter. He grabs it and pours it on the floor. 
ALEX (CONT'D) You're wasting some good shit. 
Now he pours it on Alex. 
JOHN Yeah, good shit; high alcohol content. 
John smashes the bottle on the floor; tequila goes everywhere. 
THUG (O.S.) What's going on?! Let me out! 
ALEX You going to burn me out? 
John lights a rag as the thug in the closet continues to yell and pound. Now calmly: 
JOHN Yeah.    That's what I'm going to do. 
DAVID Oh Jesus.    Oh Jesus. 
JOHN Your money. 
ALEX (no longer smiling) This is a meth lab, you idiot! 
JOHN No.    It was. 
And he tosses the burning rag at the smashed bottle.        David screams as the room explodes in flames. 
(CONTINUED) 
203   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                 203 
ALEX (suddenly desperate) My kid is upstairs!! 
JOHN -- What?? 
ALEX MY KID!! 
Without warning, Alex dashes for the front hall. Stunned, John doesn't shoot. He grabs David by the hair, sticks the gun in his temple and shoves him into the front hall. 
DAVID Let me go!! 
JOHN Get up there!! 
John pushes him up the stairs as a shield, following the trail of blood. 
DAVID The house is going to explode! 
ANGLE ON BACK DOOR 
Nabulsi sees the brightly painted walls of the child's room. 
LT. NABULSI He have a kid? 
SGT. HARRIS Neighbor said wife left with him last year. Big surprise there. 
LT. NABULSI They type all this blood yet? 
SGT. HARRIS No, but someone left through the back door bleeding. Zone Three found a gunshot victim dead on a transit bench. 
Nabulsi nods and descends the stairs. 
216   EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- NIGHT                                      216 
John snips the links of a tall chainlink fence, then turns and walks back to the Prius. 
217   INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT                             217 
John eases open his parents' front door and removes his key from the lock. It's the middle of the night, so he is surprised to see a light on in the kitchen. He enters, carrying his jacket and backpack, and places them on a chair. When he gets to the kitchen he sees his father in his pajamas, reading a biography and sipping a cup of tea. 
JOHN Hi.    What are you doing up? 
George shrugs.     An uncomfortable silence. 
JOHN (CONT'D) I've come to get Luke. 
George nods. After another silence, John starts down the hall. His father appears in the hallway behind him. 
GEORGE John?    Are you alright? 
John turns around, surprised. 
JOHN I'm fine. 
The two men look at each other for a moment, John leaves the room. 
His father steps into the living room and notices his jacket falling off the chair. George lifts it to set it right and sees something is sticking out of the backpack: airplane tickets and passports. 
218   INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                                 218 
John steps into the room that he had as a teenager. Luke sleeps in the single bed. John sits beside him, touches his face, then looks around the room, wondering how he got here, and is overwhelmed. 
219   INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                  219 
George slips the tickets and passports out of the side pocket. We do not see the destination, but he does. He opens the passport and reads each of the false names. 
220   INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                               220 
John brushes away tears, no idea how he could be acting like this. He tries to wake Luke. 
JOHN Hey.   Hey, buddy. 
Not a chance. John checks the old alarm clock: it's just after three AM. He lies down beside Luke for just a moment. 
221   INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- NIGHT                                    221 
John WAKES to the sound of a whistle. He checks the clock. It's almost five. How could that have happened? 
222   INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT                         222 
John helps a sleepy Luke with his jacket, pancake rolled in his hand. John stands from the table strewn with food. 
JOHN What do you say? 
LUKE Thank you. 
JOHN Give Grandma a big kiss. 
LUKE I'm too tired to kiss. 
JOHN Luke... 
GRACE I'll get lots of kisses next weekend. (to John) We want to take him to the Harvest Festival in Kutztown, where they have the Clydesdales. 
John thinks about saying something, can't.   He watches Luke give Grace a kiss. 
LUKE Thank you, Grandma. 
John turns to his father, who stands in the doorway. 
His father holds out the jacket in silence. John takes it. The airline tickets stick out from the inside pocket. 
(CONTINUED) 
222   CONTINUED:                                                            222 
John realizes the tickets have been moved from the bag. He looks at his father, who gazes back at him in silence. John can tell by the look in his father's eye that he knows. 
JOHN Bye Mom. 
They kiss.    John's father stands behind him. 
GEORGE Goodbye. 
George grabs his son in an awkward hug.      John is shocked. He pats his father's back. They break. 
JOHN (to Luke) Let's go. 
John leaves.      The front door closes.   Grace walks away. 
223   EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- PRE-DAWN                                      223 
John stands in the brightly lit, glass-walled kiosk of a rental car company, the Prius parked at the curb, as the sun threatens to break over the horizon. 
SGT. HARRIS She's in prison for life.      The rapist is out. 
LT. NABULSI Find him. 
238   EXT. NICOLE'S HOUSE -- MORNING                                        238 
John stands with Luke, who holds a hand-wrapped gift.        Luke knocks at the front door of a lovely small house. 
NICOLE   (O.S.) Hello? 
They see Nicole in the side yard, spreading a paper tablecloth. 
JOHN ...Hi. 
They move to help keep the tablecloth from blowing away. 
NICOLE Thanks.   Good to see you.

LUKE (hands her present) It's a pony. 
NICOLE Those aren't easy to wrap. (now awkward) You know the party is at eleven, right? 
JOHN What time is it? (checks watch) Nine. Oh, I'm so sorry, I should have looked more carefully. 
NICOLE It's no problem. (to Luke, re: present) Why don't you go give this to Carrie? 
Luke spots Carrie on the back step and runs over. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) Well, I guess you can help. 
JOHN Oh. Actually, I can't stay.   I have to run some errands. 
NICOLE (recovering with grace) We'll see you later then. 
JOHN Thanks so much. (a moment) If.... 
John looks to Luke and realizes this might be the last time he sees him. 
JOHN (CONT'D) He...He has my parents' phone number in his pocket. In case I'm late. 
NICOLE No problem. 
John throws one more look at Luke then walks off.

SGT. HARRIS (checks papers in his hand) County; right here in town. 
LT. NABULSI (after mulling this over) She have a husband or kid old enough to drive?

Harris speeds toward the hospital.         Nabulsi is on the radio. 
DISPATCHER (V.O.) Lieutenant, the prisoner is secure; jail personnel are 10-27, Code 4. A squad car will meet you at the entrance. 
Nabulsi puts the walkie down and flips on the siren.          Harris reacts. 
SGT. HARRIS She just said -- 
LT. NABULSI Run the light. 
258   INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - ROOM 7725 -- DAY                             258 
A second handgun and holster      slides across the floor to meet the one that already lies by      John's feet. The two guards kneel, facing the far wall.       John pulls a roll of duct tape from the backpack and tosses      it to the terrified nurse. 
JOHN Tape their hands and feet. (when he hesitates) Do it!! 
The nurse tapes the guards' wrists behind their backs. 
LARA You have to stop this. 
JAIL GUARD #1 You walk out that door with him and you will both be killed.

258   CONTINUED:                                                                258 
JOHN Tape their mouths! 
John picks up the key and undoes Lara's cuffs. 
LARA No.   Stop. 
John yanks her clothing and a white smock out of the bag and tosses them to her. 
JOHN Put it on. 
LARA WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?! 
JOHN Because we have no other choice!! Put it on! (to nurse) Turn around. 
He does, John starts taping his wrists. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Lara, put the clothes on! 
LARA No. 
JOHN NOW!! 
LARA No! 
They stare at each other.         John offers her his cell phone. 
JOHN Okay. Tell your son you aren't coming. 
LARA ...Where is he? 
JOHN Waiting for you. Tell him you aren't coming. 
LARA How can you do this to me?

258    CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 258 
JOHN Push send. Tell him I'm not coming back either. 
LARA John -- 
JOHN Does it look like I'm going home?! Tell him he is alone now and his mother and father aren't coming back! 
Lara stares at him with hatred, mutters: 
LARA You son of a bitch. 
Lara pulls off her prison garb, standing before them naked except for her panties. She quite purposely does not turn away or cover herself, but lets her eyes burn into him. John presses the STOPWATCH button on his watch and the COUNTER starts running. 
259    EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ENTRANCE -- DAY              259 
A squad car pulls up outside the hospital's main entrance. One officer strides into the Emergency Room while the other takes a look around the parking lot. 
260    INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - SEVENTH FLOOR HALLWAY                  260 
Lara and John step out into the hall. John's eyes flick to the Nurse's Desk but he keeps walking. As they pass we notice DR. LIFSON standing there with Lara's file in her hand. The Duty Nurse notices as well. It takes a second for Lifson to understand what is going on. She steps out into the hall and stares after them. 
DR. LIFSON What are you doing? 
John yanks Lara's arm and makes a dash for the elevator, pulling his gun from his pocket. 
The Duty Nurse sees what is happening and bolts down the hall, throwing open the door to room 7725. 
260A   INT. HOSPITAL - 7TH FLOOR ELEVATOR LOBBY                          260A 
The elevator doors are closing as John arrives and jams his arm in between them. The passengers see the weapon.

JOHN Get out!    Get out! 
They scurry out and the doors close. A heartbeat later the next elevator opens and the cop from downstairs steps off. 
271   INT. ELEVATOR - LOBBY LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS                         271 
The doors open. John peers around the corner, hiding his weapon. No police in the lobby, but through the glass doors he sees a squad car screeching to a halt. He grabs Lara's hand and leads her out of the elevator and around the corner. 
They weave down a corridor, deeper into the hospital, passing another cop at the Emergency Desk who has his back to them. 
They turn the corner, see a hospital guard running toward them. John recognizes him as the guard he argued with when Lara attempted suicide. John stiffens, but the guard runs past -- looking for a couple in lab coats. They quicken their steps. The guard stops at the end of the hall and turns to stare, recognizing them. He lifts his walkie and speaks. 
HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #1 Main floor, rear corridor. 
John and Lara turn a corner. John spots the SHIPPING OFFICE. They enter and head for the loading bay. 
272   INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS                                 272 
Nabulsi and Harris break into the lobby, sweating. Officers run in the front doors toward him. Nabulsi surveys the scene, realizes they couldn't have gone out the front. He hears a shout: 
HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #1 (O.S.) Back here! 
They turn and run in the direction of the voice, turning the corner and seeing the SECURITY GUARD at the end of the hall, who sees them coming turns and runs off after John and Lara. 
LT. NABULSI (into radio, on the run) Get units to Grant Street! 
273   EXT. HOSPITAL LOADING DOCK -- CONTINUOUS                          273 
John punches open the door and they hop down off the dock and take off for the street. 
274   EXT. REAR OF UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS                    274 
John tugs Lara across the street, dodging traffic. He yanks off his jacket and pulls it back on inside-out -- this side is black and gold. 
275    EXT. REAR OF UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS                        275 
Nabulsi runs out of the loading dock and into the middle of Grant Street, HARRIS and the two OFFICERS trailing. Very few pedestrians right here. Nabulsi looks to his right: a crowded crosswalk, fans heading through a pedestrian mall to a Penguins game. He looks to his left: more fans moving toward the stadium. Almost all of them are wearing team colors - a sea of black and gold. Nabulsi curses. 
276    EXT. NEARBY PEDESTRIAN MALL -- DAY                                    276 
Lara and John weave through the fans. 
JOHN Put your hair down. 
Lara obeys without thinking. John checks his watch, then opens a door. Leaving the throng of fans, he guides Lara through and down the stairs into the T-Train Subway Station. 
277    EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS                                277 
Nabulsi runs to the crosswalk as Harris takes the other direction. The other two officers take the far sidewalks. 
278    INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS                             278 
John and Lara quicken their pace.    The camera tilts up and to the glass ceiling. 
278A   EXT. PEDESTRIAN MALL -- CONTINUOUS                                    278A 
Nabulsi searches the faces in the mall. He looks down through the station skylight, catches a fleeting glimpse of them. He runs for the entrance, his walkie flying to his face. 
LT. NABULSI They're on the platform! Block stations in either direction! Call the Port Authority. Stop all trains! 
279    INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS                             279 
John sees a train approaching as they come down the stairs. Almost dragging Lara, John nudges past slower people to make it onto the train. Then they wait. The doors don't close. 
280    EXT.    UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - MAIN ENTRANCE -- CONTINUOUS             280 
Walkie in hand, Harris jumps into their unmarked car and pulls out. Two SQUAD CARS wail out past him. WHITE    9-10-09                                             96.

John spots him coming, slips the long screwdriver from the small backpack he's carrying. Lara sees him tighten his fingers around the grip. The doors finally close just as: 
283   INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS                          283 
Nabulsi bounds down the stairs. The train leaves the station. Nabulsi leaps down onto the tracks and chases it. 
284   EXT. T-TRAIN STATION -- DAY                                        284 
This station sits above ground. Three squad cars scream up. The officers clamor out of the cars and run for the platform. 
285   EXT.    DOWNTOWN STREET -- DAY                                     285

The T-Train DRIVER gets an emergency call from the base. He looks back into the car as IT RISES UP OUT OF THE UNDERGROUND. 
Daylight floods the car as the train emerges from underground. John jams the long screwdriver into the door and PRIES IT OPEN. 
288   EXT. T-TRAIN AND TRACKS -- DAY                                     288 
The wheels SCREECH and the brakes SEIZE. Passengers topple to the floor. John grabs Lara and they leap out onto the tracks. 
He finds the slit he cut in the tall fence. They slip out through it, onto the street and into the parking lot beyond. 
289   INT. HARRIS' UNMARKED CAR -- CONTINUOUS                            289 
Harris screams along the road on the far side of the tracks. He locks up his BRAKES as he sees the stalled T-Train. WHITE    9-10-09                                               97.

299   EXT. CITY STREETS -- MORNING                                      299 
John drives like a man possessed. 
300   INT. SUV - DRIVING THROUGH INTERSECTION -- MORNING                300 
John brakes as he spots a State Trooper vehicle at an intersection. As he keeps an eye on the rearview mirror, the squad car puts on its flashers, turns and follows them. 
John's hands tighten on the wheel. He keeps the speedometer at 35, praying he's not their target. 
The police vehicle passes them and takes off fast down the four lane street. 
John breathes again and drives on. He checks the stopwatch - 29 minutes flicks to 30. He pushes the button on the GPS. 
GPS VOICE Time to destination: eleven minutes. 
Lara sees him sweat, unaware of the significance of the time. 
301   EXT. STREETS -- DAY                                               301

302   INT. SUV - FOUR LANE STREET -- DAY                                302 
John's eyes flick to his stopwatch: 32 minutes flicks to 33. 
Signs appear quickly now.    Interstate: Keep Right; Zoo: Next Left. 
John keeps driving, hoping somehow that he won't have to make this choice -- their freedom, or their son. 
Too many questions rage across his face. Perhaps they can escape and his parents can somehow arrange to get Luke to them. Or perhaps Luke would be better off with his grandparents after all. 
Then there it is: 
The sign to the interstate points to the entrance ahead on the right.

302   CONTINUED:                                                        302

John takes the freeway ramp. 
303   EXT. INTERSTATE -- CONTINUOUS                                     303

304   INT. SUV - DRIVING -- CONTINUOUS                                  304 
LARA You took the wrong turn!    It's back there. 
No response. Lara looks back over her shoulder, wondering if this is some kind of shortcut. 
LARA (CONT'D) The zoo is back there. You're going the wrong way! (no response) It's back there! (no response) WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!! 
JOHN She'll call my parents. 
LARA What?? 
JOHN They'll take care of him, I will figure out how to get him to us. 
LARA Are you out of your mind! 
JOHN I tried!! There's no more time!! Any second now there's going to be a roadblock ahead! It might be there now!! If we don't get out now we don't get out!! 
Lara sits back in her seat, stunned and horrified, as John continues. 
(CONTINUED) 
304   CONTINUED:                                                         304 
JOHN (CONT'D) I promise. I promise I will find a way to get Luke to us. I will find some way. 
Lara unsnaps her seat belt. She reaches for the door latch. John sees her pull the door and GRABS her by the shirt as he slams his foot on the brakes! 
The tires SCREAM, the SUV skids into an uncontrolled turn. 
Horns blare. Cars behind them swerve to avoid collision. John holds Lara in her seat as the SUV flies around in a circle and finally comes to a dead stop on the shoulder, miraculously facing in the right direction. 
John allows himself to breathe. He lets go of Lara's shirt. She opens the door and steps out. 
John closes his eyes and tries to gather himself back together. He opens his door and steps out. 
305   EXT. INTERSTATE HWY - SHOULDER -- DAY                              305 
John sees the big rig truck driver look back from where he's pulled over. John nods to him that everything is okay and comes around the bumper to find Lara sitting on the gravel shoulder, leaning against the back tire, staring out at the field beyond. He sits beside her in silence. 
Behind them the cars whip by.    No one even thinks to stop to see if they need help. 
Lara and John watch a cow in the farmer's field. 
LARA John? (no reply) What are we going to do? 
JOHN (finally) We're going to the train station. 
John turns right, heading downtown. 
312   INT. POLICE STATION -- DAY                                          312 
Detective Quinn spots Harris fly in carrying a brimming green trash bag. Quinn jumps up and follows him into the SITUATION ROOM. COLLERO hurries to catch up. 
Harris dumps the contents onto the conference table as she enters. Quinn immediately dives into the contents. HARRIS and COLLERO share an awkward look. 
SGT. HARRIS (smitten) Hi. 
DETECTIVE COLLERO (casting her eyes down) Hi. 
She and Harris dig into the crumpled papers and photos. 
DETECTIVE QUINN (to Collero) You're not going to nod off, are you?

John double-parks and pulls on a ball cap. Traffic is snarled, the place is awash with police and squad cars. Hundreds of people mill out front. 
JOHN Stay in the car. 
John puts on his sunglasses and walks right through the middle of it all. Lara watches, certain he will be spotted and arrested. 
John steps onto the crowded sidewalk outside the front doors. He speaks to a large woman; she shakes her head. He goes on to speak to a black couple, who apparently aren't interested. He approaches an elderly couple.

Nabulsi is on the phone, catching hell from his Captain, who has had an earful from his counterpart in the State Police. 
LT. NABULSI I understand....I understand. I didn't tell them to stop EVERY vehicle. Just the ones with a couple and a young child. 
He hangs up, takes the quarter from his pocket and spins it on his desk. 
316   INT./EXT. FREEWAY TOLLBOOTH -- DAY                               316 
John spies the tollbooth ahead, traffic down to two lanes. The ELDERLY MAN beside him has a small bag on his lap. 
ELDERLY MAN Are you sure twenty dollars is enough? Ticket to Buffalo costs three times that. 
And now we notice the man's WIFE sitting in the back seat, with Luke and Lara. John pays the toll.

JOHN (re: SUV) This thing is very good on gas. 
A State Trooper waves them toward the booth. 
The trooper ahead checks them out and waves them on.       They are free. 
The same trooper stops the car behind them -- in it, a couple with a child. 
317   INT. POLICE STATION - NABULSI'S OFFICE -- DAY                        317 
DETECTIVE COLLERO Every one in the state. 
LT. NABULSI Go wider. Send their photos to every train, bus station and airport in a three hundred mile radius. 
DETECTIVE COLLERO (looking at her pad) So, Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Michigan, Kentucky and Indiana? 
LT. NABULSI You know what direction they are going, smart ass? 
DETECTIVE COLLERO Captain, a lot of these places barely have fax machines. 
LT. NABULSI Then start dialing. (as they exit:) Prioritize. Closest airports first. 
Nabulsi spins the quarter again, staring at it as if it will give him the answer. 
318   EXT. DOWNTOWN BUFFALO -- AFTERNOON                                   318

Harris steps out into the HALL, passing an INTERVIEW ROOM. 
Behind the glass he sees QUINN grilling MICK. Harris keeps going into Nabulsi's office. Nabulsi sits, spinning the coin, jacket off, shirt untucked. 
SGT. HARRIS You want to see it? 
LT. NABULSI Only if it will tell me where they are. 
He notes them, taps the screen again and the two take their place beside the others on the watch list. He motions for the traveler to hand over her passport. 
ANGLE ON THE BRENNANS 
walking away. 
329    INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- NIGHT                   329 
The phones are quiet. Alone, Harris stares at the portion of the wall that he assembled. Collero enters. 
DETECTIVE QUINN Too bad you didn't find more of it. 
SGT. HARRIS Yeah. And wish I could figure out where this is. 
He points to a small torn photo, taped back together. 
SGT. HARRIS (CONT'D) I checked websites for every tourist destination I could -- 
DETECTIVE COLLERO That's the presidential palace. (Harris turns & stares) It was all over CNN. When they deposed...what's-his-name. 
330    INT. POLICE STATION - NABULSI'S OFFICE -- NIGHT                 330 
Harris bursts in. 
SGT. HARRIS We know where they're going! 
331    INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - GATE B-15 -- NIGHT                       331 
John and Lara sit, waiting to board, Luke asleep. 
AIR CANADA ATTENDANT (V.O.) We'll now begin boarding by rows. 
331A   INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - SECURITY OFFICE -- NIGHT                 331A 
An AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF snatches photos of Lara and John out of the printer and bolts out of the office, joined by two other OFFICERS. 
332    INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - JETWAY -- NIGHT                              332 
John, Lara and Luke walk down the jetway, until they are stopped by the crowd of passengers before them. John tries not to show how nervous he really is. 
332A   INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - GATES -- NIGHT                               332A 
Airport Security runs up to the gate and pushes past the boarding passengers, searching their faces. The Airport Security Chief strides past the passengers and onto the jetway, the pages of photographs in his hand. 
333    INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- NIGHT                       333 
Nabulsi waits in silence on the other end of a phone.     The room is full, no one speaks. 
334    INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - JETWAY -- NIGHT                              334 
A second AIRPORT SECURITY OFFICER squeezes along the wall, passing the waiting passengers. We pan to see Luke's brightly colored roller-board. Our hearts stop; it is all over. 
335    INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- NIGHT                       335 
Nabulsi waits on the other line for an eternity.    Finally: 
AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF (O.S.) Sorry. There is no one by their description on the flight. 
LT. NABULSI They're on it. Do you have the photographs? 
335A   INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - JETWAY -- NIGHT                              335A 
The young AIR CANADA FLIGHT ATTENDANT kneels to help the child with the colorful rollerboard -- we see it's a FIVE YEAR-OLD GIRL. 
AIR CANADA ATTENDANT Can I take this for you? 
AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF (V.O.) We have the photographs. They aren't on this plane. 
336    INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - GATE 32 -- CONTINUOUS                        336 
Now see the GATE NUMBER and destination: PORT-AU-PRINCE. 
(CONTINUED) 
336   CONTINUED:                                                            336 
AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF (listens, turns to attendant #2) Are there any other flights to Haiti tonight? 
337   INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                    337 
AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF     (O.S.) No other flights. Anything else? 
LT. NABULSI ....No.   Thank you. 
Nabulsi hangs up, defeated.     Quinn stares out the window, deep in thought. 
DETECTIVE QUINN It's starting to rain. 
Nabulsi looks at him as if he's nuts. 
DETECTIVE COLLERO I'll call the FBI. 
Collero exits, Quinn turns and looks at the partial "wall." 
DETECTIVE QUINN You ask yourself why we found this bag and not the others? 
338   INT. AIRPLANE -- NIGHT                                                338 
Lara looks up from her son, sees her husband staring out the window at the darkness beyond. Ding. 
AIR CANADA ATTENDANT (V.O.) The captain has switched off the seat belt light. Flight time to Caracas, Venezuela this evening is five hours and fifteen minutes. While in your seat, the captain asks-- 
339   INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- NIGHT                         339

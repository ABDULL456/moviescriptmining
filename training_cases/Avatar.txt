WAINFLEET That is just wrong. 
Jake, pumping his chair, looks around as -- 
A huge TRACTOR, taller than a house, ROARS past on muddy wheels. He notices something sticking in the tires -- ARROWS. The neolithic weapons are jarring amid all the advanced technology. 
Beyond the tractor, two VTOL vehicles take off. Armored and heavily armed, they are AT-99 "SCORPION" GUNSHIPS. 
MITSUBISHI MK-6 AMPSUITS -- human operated walking machines 4 meters tall -- patrol the perimeter. They are heavily armored, and armed with a huge rotary cannon called a GAU-90. 
Beyond the outer fence stands a black wall of forest hundreds of feet high.   A SENTRY GUN OPENS FIRE from a tower. TRACERS light up the twilight. A shadowy SHAPE SHRIEKS and drops off the fence. It is an armed camp in a state of siege. 
WAINFLEET and Fike give Jake and his chair the hairy eyeball as he approaches. 
JAKE What're you two limpdicks starin' at? 
As Jake rolls past, SOMETHING SWOOPS down behind him and -- 
K-KRASH! SMASHES against the chain-link right next to his head. 
A vicious AERIAL PREDATOR a meter across gnashes glass fangs against the steel. It STABS at him through the chain link with a tail ending in a glistening stiletto. A STINGBAT. 
WAINFLEET casually BLASTS IT with his PISTOL.   It drops off the fence, tail still lashing. 
WAINFLEET Seen a lotta guys leave this place in a wheelchair. Never seen anybody show up in one. 
Jake stares at the gnashing fangs of the dying alien. 
ON A WALKWAY of the OPS CENTER, seen from above, a UNIFORMED FIGURE grips the railing, watching Jake pump his chair through the tunnel below. 
The hair is clipped short. The scalp is etched by long parallel SCARS where some Pandoran denizen's claws raked across it. The bare arms, below tightly rolled sleeves, seem hewn out of some hard tropical wood. Criss-crossed by scars. 
The MAN raises his masked face to look at the sky.    He eyes are an icy steel gray. 
HIS POV -- the mighty POLYPHEMUS seems to fill the sky, beyond the clouds. 
MAN (V.O.) You are not in Kansas any more... CUT TO: 
INT. COMMISSARY - TWILIGHT 
THE MAN from the balcony -- COLONEL MILES QUARITCH -- is the HEAD OF SECURITY for the Hell's Gate colony. A hundred new arrivals watch raptly as he paces like a panther across the front of the large cafeteria. He stops, stance wide. 
Without his mask, we see that Quaritch's features are rugged and handsome, except for the SCAR, which runs from scalp to jaw down one side of his face. On one hip he carries a very large PISTOL. 
QUARITCH ... You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen. Respect that fact every second of every day. 
JAKE ROLLS IN, watching from the back. 
COLONEL QUARITCH raises his hand and points out the window, toward the dark treeline. 
QUARITCH Out beyond that fence every living thing that crawls, flies or squats in the mud wants to kill you and eat your eyes for jujubees. 
The room gets very quiet. 
QUARITCH We have an indigenous population of humanoids here called the Na'vi. They're fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin which can stop your heart in one minute. We operate -- we live -- at a constant threat condition yellow. 
PAN ACROSS the solid faces of miners, Cat-machine drivers, engineers, geologists, as they take that in. 
QUARITCH As head of security, it's my job to keep you alive.    I will not succeed -- (pausing for effect) -- not with all of you. If you wish to survive, you need a strong mental attitude, you need to follow procedure... 
PUSH IN ON JAKE, watching as the briefing continues. 
JAKE (V.O.) Nothing like an old-school safety brief to put your mind at ease. CUT TO: 
INT. CORRIDOR 
People are roaming in both directions, looking for rooms, lugging duffels and cases. 
An eager young XENOANTHROPOLOGIST, staggering under an overpacked duffel, runs to catch up to Jake. 
NORM Hey, you're Jake right? Tom's brother? You look just like him. (off Jake's wary look) Sorry, I'm Norm Spellman, I went through avatar training with him. 
Norm offers his hand and Jake shakes it. 
NORM He was a great guy -- funny.     It was a big shock to all of us. 
JAKE Yeah. 
Jake pumps the wheels of his chair, rolling on.       Norm walks with him. 
NORM And duh! -- obviously you look like him. I mean, if you weren't genetically identical, you wouldn't be taking over his avatar. 
JAKE That's why I'm here. 
NORM So -- you want to go check it out? CUT TO: 
INT. BIO-LAB - DAY 
JAKE AND NORM enter the BIO-LAB -- a large lab complex with many adjoining rooms. 
MAX Me and Norm were out here to drive these remotely controlled bodies called avatars. They're grown from human DNA mixed with DNA from the natives here. 
A scientist, DOCTOR MAX CULLIMORE, is supervising the uncrating of two SHIPPING CONTAINERS. The nearer has the sides removed, revealing -- a ceiling-height acrylic TANK. 
Norm stops to stare, and Jake rolls past him as if drawn by some unseen force, toward -- 
THE AMNIO TANK. There is a FIGURE floating lanquidly inside, which looks like a man. A very large, very blue, man. 
Blood circulates through a synthetic UMBILICAL in the abdomen. As the figure turns in the amniotic fluid, we see that it has a lemur-like TAIL. The skin is cyan-blue. Long black hair drifts, graceful as seaweed. 
JAKE Damn.   They got big. 
NORM Yeah, they mature on the trip out. (to Max) So the proprioceptive sims worked pretty well. 
MAX Yeah, they've got great muscle tone. Give us a few hours, you guys can take them for a spin. 
THE FIGURE'S sleeping face turns toward us, and the features are -- despite feline ears and a long feral snout -- definitely JAKE'S. 
JAKE It looks like him. 
NORM No, it looks like you.   This is your avatar now, Jake. 
ON JAKE, mesmerized as he stares into the tank. 
JAKE (V.O.) The idea is -- every driver is matched to his own avatar -- 
Jake glances through a PRESSURE WINDOW. In an adjoining chamber (the AMBIENT ROOM) JAKE'S AVATAR lies on a gurney, breathing slowly in PANDORAN AIR. NORM'S AVATAR is on a second gurney. Both are attended by med techs in exo-masks. 
Norm slips into his LINK CHAIR, expertly donning biometric sensors. 
GRACE How much link time have you logged? 
NORM Five hundred and twenty hours. 
Grace looks pointedly at Jake. 
JAKE Like -- an hour. 
GRACE Tell me you're joking. 
Grace opens the hood of Jake's link unit. Jake starts hauling himself across from his wheelchair. She reaches to help him but -- 
JAKE Don't!   I got this. 
Grace steps back, hands raised.    He drags himself into the unit. 
GRACE So you just figured you'd come out here to the most hostile environment known to man, with no training of any kind, and see how it went? What was going through your head? 
He meets her eyes with a defiant glare. 
JAKE Maybe I was just tired of doctors telling me what I couldn't do. 
Grace watches him laboriously pull his inert legs into the link chair by hand. 
Jake settles into the warm fluid gel packs lining the unit. It seems to enfold him. Grace adjusts his biometric sensors, then lowers the UPPER CLAMSHELL -- 
GRACE Relax and let your mind go blank.    That shouldn't be hard for you. 
JAKE Kiss the darkest part of my lily white -- 
But the SLAMMING HOOD muffles the rest. 
MAX Initiate link. 
The LINK TECH touches some controls. 
ON A LARGE MONITOR a 3D SCAN of Jake's brain appears. Regions of activity flow with complex shifting colors. 
MAX That's a gorgeous brain.     Nice activity. 
GRACE Go figure. (walking away) Alright, I'm going in. 
TECH Phase-lock at forty percent.    He's in transition. 
Max watches a display showing the avatar's nervous system aligning with Jake's -- two ghostly networks of light merging. 
MAX That's it.     Find your way home. 
ECU JAKE, inside the link unit. His eyes move under the lids, like a dreamer in REM sleep as -- 
INSIDE JAKE'S MIND -- radiant streamers coalesce into a pulsing TUNNEL OF LIGHT and -- 
THE SCREEN FLARES WHITE -- ZZZWHAP! -- resolving into an overexposed, out-of-focus image -- two BLURRY FACES wearing masks, looking down. 
ECU JAKE'S AVATAR -- two very intense eyes FILL FRAME, the pupils contracting. Golden irises pulse with life. 
MAX He's in. 
TECH Phase-lock ninety nine percent. The link is stable. 
Blinking, Jake slowly sits up on the gurney. He looks down at his AVATAR BODY, touching his chest with one hand. 
MAX Take it slow, Jake. We need to check your motor control. Try touching your fingertips together -- 
But Jake isn't listening. He's staring at his legs.     He eases them off the gurney and -- 
HIS BLUE FEET touch the concrete floor, taking his weight. 
JAKE STANDS, feeling the strength in his legs.    His expression is child-like with wonder. 
HIS POV -- looking down at the med techs, who seem the size of children next to his 9' tall frame. 
He sees something like a blue tentacle curl across his arm and he JERKS AROUND in alarm. HIS TAIL. 
As he turns to see it, the tail sweeps instruments off a table with a crash. Jake laughs and grins at Max. 
MED TECH Easy, Jake, I need you to sit down -- 
But Jake takes a step, then another. The wires to the bio- monitors pull taut, and he yanks them off his chest. 
MAX Jake! Wait, we have to run some tests -- 
But Jake pushes past the protesting med techs, toward the door and -- 
EXT. AVATAR COMPOUND - DAY 
Jake emerges, blinking in the morning sun. He finds himself in the AVATAR COMPOUND -- a living and training area. 
Nearby, a couple of AVATARS are playing one-on-one in front of a (non-regulation height) basketball net. Others go about their daily activities around the compound. 
Jake flexes his legs -- JUMPS -- and lands a little unsteadily, but his expression is joyful. 
He takes a few steps and breaks into a RUN. People are calling to him, somehwere, but he doesn't hear them -- he's running. RUNNING! 
He finds himself in the COMPOUND GARDEN, and stops amid neatly tended rows of ALIEN PLANTS. He looks down, wiggling his toes in the warm soil. Then inhales deeply -- revelling in the alien smells -- earth, plants, the nearby forest. He looks at his bare footprint in the soil of an alien world. 
GRACE (O.S.) Hey Marine! 
Jake turns at the familiar voice to see -- 
A statuesque FEMALE AVATAR walking toward him. AVATAR GRACE is magnificent, with panther thighs, flat muscular stomach and firm athlete's breasts. She wears shorts and a T-shirt. In human years she would be about 35. 
JAKE Grace? 
GRACE Well who'd you expect, numbnuts?   Think fast! 
She throws him a piece of Pandoran fruit, which he catches. 
GRACE Motor control is looking good. 
Jake bites into the fruit, the juice running down his chin. 
He points to his scarred face. 
QUARITCH They could fix this if I rotated back. But you know what? I kinda like it. Reminds me every day what's out there. Besides, I can't leave -- 
He looks out, as if he can see through the wall to the tree- line. 
QUARITCH This is my war, here. 
Quaritch climbs the `suit and reaches into the cockpit, throwing some switches. The `suit's gas-turbine spools up with a rising WHINE. 
QUARITCH The avatar program is a joke -- buncha limpdick scientists. But we have a unique opportunity here, you and I. A recon Marine in an avatar body could get me the intel I need, on the ground, right in the hostiles' camp. 
The WHINE is now a roaring WHOOSH as the `suit trembles with power. The air boils above the exhaust vents. 
Quaritch reaches in and operates the controls, flexing one huge hand. He nods to the waiting mechanic -- 
QUARITCH Looks good. (to Jake) I need you to learn about these savages, gain their trust. Find out how I can force their cooperation, or hit `em hard if they don't. Maybe you can keep some of my boys from going home like you. Or bagged-and-tagged. 
JAKE (NODDING) That sounds real good, Colonel.   So -- am I still with Augustine? 
QUARITCH On paper. You walk like one of her science pukes, you quack like one, but you report to me. Can you do that for me? 
Jake nods. Quaritch brings the `suit to life. He steps forward and pivots smoothly. 
He balances the two ton machine on one foot while sweeping the arms in strong, graceful arcs. Jake realizes he is doing a WU-SHOO KATA. A flawless display of strength and control. He's impressive, and Jake is impressed. Quaritch is the kind of man he respects -- focused, hard. Determined. 
QUARITCH Look, son -- I take care of my own. Get me what I need, I'll see you get your legs back when you rotate home. Your real legs. 
He raises the `suit's hand, and slams the canopy shut like the visor of a helmet. Jake watches Quaritch walk past, huge feet CLANGING -- KUNG! KUNG! KUNG! 
INT. BIO LAB - DAY 
GRACE is on the move, gulping coffee, in a hurry to get their FIRST SORTIE started. She hands a clipboard to MAX. 
GRACE Start calibrating. We're on the flight line in ten minutes. 
Max nods and jogs ahead toward the LINK ROOM. JAKE and NORM fall in with Grace as they enter the CONNECTING CORRIDOR. 
GRACE What did Atilla want? 
JAKE Just Marines comparin' tattoos. 
GRACE (not buying it) Yeah. Well, listen to me, Marine -- 
She stops, turning to drill him with a look. 
GRACE -- you're driving an avatar, now.     That means you're in my world, got it? 
JAKE Got it. 
She turns and enters the LINK ROOM. 
INT. LINK ROOM 
Grace crosses to the controls of Jake's LINK UNIT. As the others catch up -- 
GRACE That son of a bitch has screwed up this program enough. All this -- (indicating link room) -- exists so we can go out there and build a bridge of trust to these people, who could teach us so much. But thanks to Quaritch and his thugs the Na'vi won't even talk to us anymore. 
JAKE Then how's this supposed to work? 
GRACE We have a new face. (turning to Norm) You're fluent, you've studied the culture. You're non-threatening. The ones we know best -- the Omaticaya clan -- may give you a chance. Maybe you can get them back to the table before things go tits-up for good. 
NORM This is failing as a pep talk. 
Jake hauls himself across from wheelchair to link. 
JAKE How do we contact them? 
GRACE We don't. They contact us. If they see us taking our samples, treating the forest with respect -- (pointedly to Jake) Not trampling everything in sight -- they may reach out to us. 
JAKE Or they may skin us and make a drum. 
Jake lies back, lowering the sensor array over his body. 
GRACE Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the talking. 
She closes his clamshell, HARD, and we -- CUT TO: 
EXT. RAIN FOREST / AERIAL - DAY 
FLYING over a carpet of rainforest, past sheer cliffs and cloud-wreathed mesas. TRUDY'S SAMSON TILT-ROTOR chases its shadow across the treetops. Though big as a Blackhawk, it is tiny in the vast primeval landscape. 
ANGLE THROUGH the open side doors of the Samson. Trooper WAINFLEET, in exo-mask and body armor, leans on his door gun, scanning for aerial predators. 
In avatar form JAKE, GRACE and NORM watch the forest unrolling beneath them, the wind blasting their clothes. Jake mans the other door gun, his feet propped on the skids. 
TRUDY flies from a pressurized cockpit. She banks to follow a shallow river. 
TRUDY (INTERCOM) Sturmbeest herd, one o'clock. 
Norm grins and points, excitedly. Jake looks in time to see-- A herd of STURMBEEST -- massive six-legged creatures reminiscent of buffalo -- thundering across the river. 
GRACE Looks like a bull, six cows and some juveniles. 
NORM The bull has the red on the dorsal armor? 
Grace nods approvingly. 
TIME CUT -- Hundreds of purple winged creatures take flight from a lake, startled by the Samson. They skim the water above their own reflections. TETRAPTERONS. 
TIME CUT -- the ground drops away as the Samson flies over a WATERFALL hundreds of feet high. Trudy banks hard, rolling in on the gorge below like it's a gun-run. 
Wainfleet WHOOPS while Norm looks like he's about to puke. 
WAINFLEET Yo Chacon!     Get some! 
Jake grins into the airstream. CUT TO: 
EXT. CLEARING - DAY 
A small meadow among towering trees. The fern-like "grass" is beaten down in waves by the rotor-wash as the Samson settles to the ground. 
Jake pulls the massive door gun off its pintle mount and hefts it like an assault rifle. 
He and Wainfleet leap out to secure the LZ, scanning the tree- line warily, weapons aimed. 
SOMETHING rises up behind him out of focus -- 
A THANATOR. The most awesome land predator the universe has ever conceived This thing could eat a T-rex and have the Alien for desert. 
It is a black six-limbed panther from Hell, with an armored head and massive distensible jaws. 
JAKE, unaware of the advancing thanator, is still bracing the hammerhead -- 
JAKE That's what I'm talkin' about, bitch! 
The bull wheels around, TRUMPETING in fear, and CRASHES away through splintering undergrowth. 
JAKE That's right motherf-- 
A guttural SNARL behind him. Jake spins in time to see -- 
THREE TONS of rippling thanator LAUNCH over him, landing between him and the hammerhead. The ground shakes. 
The thanator emits an earsplitting ROAR, enraged that the hammerhead got away. It twists on itself, turning to face Jake, and bares its fangs with a lethal HISS. 
JAKE What about this one?       Run, don't run? What? 
GRACE Run.     Definitely RUN! 
Jake BOLTS as -- 
The thanator LEAPS after him and -- 
Jake launches himself between two large trunks, forcing the beast to claw its way around to the side while -- 
Jake scrambles up -- around -- over a tangle of roots and -- 
SK-RASH!! CLAWS SLASH the air behind him, EXPLODING bark off a trunk as -- 
JAKE wills himself forward in a frenzy. With rippling muscle the beast is airborne again, blacking out the sun but -- 
JAKE dives under a massive root system, and -- 
CRASH! Kindling rains around him as the beast tears into the root-trunks above him. Claws SLASH down next to him as he rolls and crawls -- 
Glistening jaws SMASH and SNAP against the barrier trunks, sending chunks of wood flying. It's spittle sprays across Jake, jaws inches away as -- 
He rolls onto his back, and FIRES his AR point blank but the rifle is SNATCHED out of his hands. The beast SCREECHES an ungodly WAIL of pain and rage and -- RIPS the ENTIRE TRUNK away. Jake scrambles to escape but -- 
GLISTENING JAWS lunge downward, SNAP SHUT and -- 
The creature rips Jake out of the tree, shaking him like a junkyard dog with a rabbit, only -- 
It has him by the BACKPACK, so Jake unlatches it and -- 
He FLIES FREE as the thanator crushes the pack with its teeth. Giving Jake a moment to sprint away, but -- 
With a hideous BELLOW the thanator crashes after him, splintering trees. 
JAKE RUNS in a blur, dodging between trunks as a glistening black tornado shreds the forest behind him and -- 
He sees WATER ahead and DIVES OUTWARD with all his might -- 
The thanator's jaws SNAP SHUT inches behind him as he flies out into open space and -- 
JAKE SPLASHES down into a swiftly moving river. 
The thanator LEAPS DOWN AFTER HIM, pursuing from rock to rock, its claws swiping like a grizzly fishing for salmon. 
Jake ducks under as -- FWHOOSH! -- black claws SLASH past his face amid turbulent bubbles. 
A WATERFALL ahead. Jake is swept over the falls, with the thanator SWIPING at him from a rock, just MISSING and -- 
Jake disappears down the throat of the thundering cataract. 
EXT. RIVER BELOW FALLS - DAY 
The water boils below the cataract. Jake's head bursts through the surface, and he gasps for breath. 
He is carried along by the current, but manages to grab a limb on a fallen tree. He weakly pulls himself up, and just lies there gasping on the trunk. 
Above him, on the cliff, the THANATOR BELLOWS, a roar which echoes across the jungle. CUT TO: 
EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY 
JAKE, wet and bruised, crouches under a screen of giant leaves.   He hacks manically at the end of a cut sapling with his knife, forming a crude but sharp tip. 
EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY 
TRACKING with Jake as he walks through the forest like it's a minefield, carrying his SPEAR white-knuckled. He is freaked and hyper-alert. 
The trees here are a hundred meters high, blocking out the sky. A few pencil beams of sunlight filter down into the cyan gloom. 
POV FROM ABOVE -- looking down through leaves we watch Jake move warily through the forest. 
ECU -- TWO GOLDEN EYES, bright in the shadows. 
DOWNANGLE as Jake passes under a tree limb. Invisible to him, draped on the limb like a leopard, is a striking NA'VI GIRL. She watches, only her eyes moving. 
She is lithe as a cat, with a long neck, muscular shoulders, and nubile breasts. And she is devastatingly beautiful -- for a girl with a tail. In human age she would be 18. Her name is NEYTIRI(nay-Tee-ree). 
Jake passes less than 2 meters beneath her, oblivious. 
NEYTIRI rises soundlessly. In one fluid, sinuous movement she NOCKS an arrow to her BOW and DRAWS, aiming RIGHT AT JAKE. Utterly silent. 
Below her Jake is totally unaware of the arrow aimed at his THROAT. 
ON NEYTIRI as she follows him with the bow, muscles tensing for the shot -- 
-- and SOMETHING drifts down in front of her, F.G.    She hesitates. 
RACK FOCUS to the tip of the arrow -- where a single WOODSPRITE floats down to land on the arrow-head.Like a dandelion seed, but larger, the WOODSPRITE waves its silky CILIA, feather light, as it balances on the deadly point. It glows faintly in the dark shadows. 
NEYTIRI frowns, puzzled, and LOWERS her bow slowly.   The woodsprite WHIRLS away into the gloom. CUT TO: 
INT./EXT. SAMSON - SUNSET 
GRACE and NORM peer down into the shadowed forest as TRUDY banks in a search pattern. 
TRUDY (INTERCOM) I'm going to have to call it, guys. We're not allowed to run night ops. Colonel's orders. 
Neytiri ignores him, assuming a prayer posture over the dead animal. 
NEYTIRI (in Na'vi) Forgive me. May your spirit run with the Great Mother. 
JAKE I would have been screwed if you hadn't come along -- 
She rises and walks away without looking at Jake. 
JAKE Hey, wait. Wait!   Where you goin'? 
He crashes through some plants, catching up to her. 
JAKE Slow down a second will you. I just want to thank you for killing those -- 
He makes the mistake of grasping her shoulder and -- 
WHACK! She WALLOPS him upside the head with her bow in a fierce backhand swing, laying him out flat. 
He looks up to see a FURY standing over him. A Fury who speaks English -- accented, halting, angry English. 
NEYTIRI Don't thank! You don't thank for this! This is sad. Very sad, only. 
JAKE Okay, I'm sorry.    Whatever I did -- I'm sorry. 
She gestures at the bodies of the viperwolves. 
NEYTIRI All this is your fault! They did not need to die. 
JAKE They attacked me.   How'm I the bad guy HERE-- 
She silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat. 
NEYTIRI Your fault! You are like a baby, making noise, don't know what to do. You should not come here, all of you! You only come and make problems. Only. 
Jake gets up, slowly, facing her. 
JAKE Okay, fine, you love your little forest friends. So why not just let them kill my ass? What's the thinking? 
CU Neytiri -- looking away. Finally, reluctantly, her eyes MEET HIS for the first time -- a riveting gaze with those big gold orbs. 
NEYTIRI Why save you? 
JAKE Yes, why save me? 
NEYTIRI You have a strong heart.   No fear. 
She leans closer -- 
NEYTIRI But stupid! Ignorant like a child! 
She turns away, stalking off, but Jake goes after her. 
TRACKING WITH Neytiri as she climbs nimbly along a huge ROOT. 
WIDER as she trots with perfect balance along the root, which forms an elevated walkway. 
Jake runs to catch up, realizing suddenly that he is far above the forest floor. Throughout the following they move through a GLOWING PHANTASMAGORICAL FOREST. 
JAKE If I'm so ignorant, maybe you should teach me. 
NEYTIRI Sky people can not learn.   You do not See. 
She leaps to another elevated root.   Jake follows, surprised that he made it. 
JAKE Whooaa. 
He runs to catch up with her easy jogging pace. 
JAKE Then teach me to "see." 
She stops and he almost runs into her. 
NEYTIRI No one can teach you to See. 
Then she turns and trots on. 
EXT. GORGE - NIGHT 
They run across the elevated root of an enormous tree -- a horizontal trunk big as an oak. 
WIDE SHOT as they cross a DEEP GORGE. A waterfall shimmers silver in the Polyphemus-light. Vines hang down a hundred feet into the gorge, and among them swoop stingbats and other night flyers. 
JAKE Hey, slow down. Look, I think we just got off on the wrong foot and -- 
Jake looks down, suddenly aware of the height. 
JAKE --you just have to get to know me. I'm Jake. Jake Sull-- 
A vine catches his spear and spins him off balance.   He drops the spear and almost falls off the root. 
JAKE Whooaaa -- shit! 
Neytiri catches him with one hand, gripping his bicep. He watches the spear cartwheel down to splash in the river. 
She pulls him upright. Shouts at him in English and Na'vi. 
JAKE I need your help. 
NEYTIRI You should not be here. 
JAKE So take me with you. 
NEYTIRI No. You go back. 
DOWN ANGLE FROM FAR ABOVE -- several WOODSPRITES float down through the trees. FOLLOW THEM as they descend silently toward Jake and Neytiri. 
NEYTIRI, sensing a presence, looks up to see -- 
The WOODSPRITES, PULSING with purpose, float right towards Jake. They dance gently around his shoulders and head. 
JAKE (off her amazed look) What? 
More woodsprites gather around him.   Several ALIGHT on him. 
Jake holds still, knowing he should be afraid -- but somehow he's not. He spreads his arms. More sprites come, landing all over his arms, hands, body. 
JAKE Who's Eywa? 
Neytiri kneels before her like an acolyte as Mo'at passes. 
The villagers stare silently as the Matriarch circles slowly around Jake, examining his tail and the end of his queue. 
MO'AT (thick accent) What are you called? 
JAKE Jake Sully. 
She produces a long THORN between her fingertips. With a flourish she strikes his chest. 
Jake flinches. RED BLOOD wells up and Mo'at rubs some between her fingertips. She tastes it. 
MO'AT Why did you come to us? 
JAKE I came to learn. 
MO'AT We have tried to teach other Sky People. It is hard to fill a cup which is already full. 
JAKE My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask Doctor Augustine. I'm no scientist. 
MO'AT What are you? 
JAKE I don't know. I was a Marine -- uh, a warrior. Of the Jarhead clan. 
TSU'TEY (SUBTITLED) A warrior! I could kill him easily! 
EYTUKAN (SUBTITLED) No! This is the first warrior dreamwalker we have seen. We need to learn more about him. 
JAKE What's going on?   What are they saying? 
MO'AT (to Neytiri, subtitled) Daughter. You will teach him our way, to speak and walk as we do. 
NEYTIRI looks shocked, then angry. 
NEYTIRI (SUBTITLED) Why me? That's not fair!     I only-- 
MO'AT (SUBTITLED) It is decided! 
Neytiri subsides, turning to glare at Jake. 
MO'AT (to Jake) My daughter will teach you our ways. Learn well, Jakesully. We will see if your insanity can be cured. 
She turns to Neytiri, her expression stern -- 
MO'AT (SUBTITLED) He is your responsibility. 
Neytiri nods, accepting, but she's not a happy camper.   She grabs Jake's arm and pulls him roughly away. 
JAKE So it's all good, right?   You and me -- 
NEYTIRI Do not speak. CUT TO: 
INT. SECOND LEVEL/HOMETREE 
LATER, Neytiri leads Jake up the spiral to the SECOND LEVEL. He now wears only a ratty LOINCLOTH. His wounds are bound with plant-fiber bandages. 
THE ENTIRE CLAN is squatting at dinner in a huge circle. They stop talking and turn to gaze at Jake as he enters the circle. 
JAKE Don't get up. 
Neytiri crosses the circle to the cook pit and returns with several large leaves heaped with food. She kneels next to Jake, placing the food in front of him almost DEFIANTLY. 
JAKE You never told me your name. 
NEYTIRI Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite. 
JAKE Okay, again, a whole lot slower. 
NEYTIRI (exaggerated slowness) Neytiri. Nay-TEE-ree. 
Jake knows she's baiting him.   He smiles in response. 
JAKE Nay-TEE-ree. That's nice. Nay-TEE-ree. 
ACROSS THE CIRCLE, Tsu'tey, Mo'at and Eytukan sit together, glancing up occasionally from their food to the stranger. 
TSU'TEY (SUBTITLED) These aliens try to look like people, but they can't. 
MO'AT (SUBTITLED) He seems dim to me.   And his eyes are too small. 
NEYTIRI motions for Jake to take portions from the serving leaves onto his own leaf. 
JAKE Your mom likes me.    I can tell. 
MO'AT, watching Jake and Neytiri, leans over to Eytukan. 
MO'AT (SUBTITLED) Neytiri will test this "warrior." Hey may learn nothing -- but we will learn much. 
EYTUKAN You speak truth. We must understand these Sky People if we are to drive them out. 
Jake munches on a white shrimp-like thing. 
JAKE These rock. What are they? 
NEYTIRI Teylu. You call beetle larvae. 
Jake blanches. She heaps some more onto his leaf -- a CHALLENGE -- and Jake meets her eyes, takes a handful, and starts munching enthusiastically. 
JAKE That's some damn fine teylu. That's like grandma's teylu. 
CU TSU'TEY, warily eyeing Jake -- 
TSU'TEY (SUBTITLED) I say she will kill him. CUT TO: 
INT. THIRD LEVEL - NIGHT 
The sleeping level -- families nesting in groups on woven hammocks the size of trampolines. The hunters sleep along SPOKES joining the inner trunk to the tree's outer shell. 
Jake lies awake in a hammock, people rustling in the darkness around him. Neytiri is nearby, curled up like a little girl. She stares at him for a moment, then closes her eyes. 
Jake watches the glowing bugs fluttering inside a night- light, a pulse of life energy. A strange peace spreads through him. He closes his eyes and -- CUT TO: 
INT. LINK ROOM - NIGHT 
-- a young mother pounds seeds into meal, while nursing an infant. 
--children chase each other and climb like monkeys. One bold LITTLE GIRL runs up to Jake, stops -- staring -- then shrieks with laughter as she runs back to her playmates. 
GRINNING, Jake turns to see NEYTIRI cantering toward him on a DIREHORSE. She leads a second horse, an old sway-backed MARE. His grin drops. 
EXT. RIVER NEAR HOMETREE - DAY 
JAKE nervously grips the surcingle of the mare. Neytiri holds its nose-ring while Jake clumsily mounts. 
Jake bends one of its ANTENNAE down to the tip of his queue. He hesitantly touches them together and -- 
TIGHT SHOT -- the tendrils INTERWEAVE. 
Jake's PUPILS DILATE and his mouth drops open. The horse's eyes also go wide and it HONKS nervously. Neytiri touches her fingertips to the neural interface. 
NEYTIRI This is shahaylu -- the bond. Feel her heartbeat, her breath. Feel her strong legs. 
Jake closes his eyes, nodding.   One with the horse. 
TSU'TEY and another young hunter come out of the forest leading TWO DIREHORSES. The magnificent animals drink from the edge of the pool. Tsu'tey watches Jake's riding lesson with disdain. 
NEYTIRI You may tell her what to do -- (she touches her head) -- inside. For now, say where to go. 
JAKE Forward. 
The horse LAUNCHES into a GALLOP. Jake flops around, with no idea how to sit the animal, and is promptly THROWN OFF. He lands painfully in the mud. 
He gets up, brushing mud off knees and ass, as Neytiri leads the horse back to him. 
NEYTIRI Again. 
SERIES OF JUMP CUTS -- Jake falls off the horse in various ways, seemingly landing harder each time. 
ON JAKE, face down in the mud of the riverbank. He painfully rises to hands and knees. Which is when he sees -- 
TSU'TEY and another HUNTER thundering across the shallow river on their direhorses. Spray blasts up from their hooves. 
Jake stands, covered in mud, as Tsu'tey stops his horse next to him, looking down with disdain. 
TSU'TEY You should go away. 
JAKE (to Neytiri) I knew this guy could speak English. 
Tsu'tey turns to Neytiri, who is leading the old mare back. 
TSU'TEY (SUBTITLED) This alien will learn nothing.   A rock Sees more. 
She sighs in agreement. Tsu'tey and the other hunter wheel their horses around and THUNDER OFF into the woods. 
NEYTIRI gestures to Jake's horse. 
NEYTIRI Again. CUT TO: 
OPS CENTER - NIGHT 
Grouped around a table are JAKE, COLONEL QUARITCH, SELFRIDGE and few ENGINEERS and OFFICERS. Jake is talking them through plans he's made of Hometree's inner structure. 
JAKE You've got outer columns, then a secondary ring here, and an inner ring. Then a core structure, it's like a spiral, that's how they move up and down. 
QUARITCH I'm going to need accurate scans of all these columns. 
JAKE Roger that. 
ANGLE ON MAX, at the stairwell. He's been watching Jake talking rapidly to Quaritch, but can't hear him. Frowning, he backs away, down the stairs. CUT TO: 
INT. BIO LAB - DAY 
JAKE, GRACE and NORM are packing science gear and supplies. 
GRACE I'm not about to let Quaritch and Selfridge micro-manage this thing. (she looks pointedly at Jake) We're going up into the mountains. (MORE) 
GRACE (cont'd) There's a mobile link up at Site 26 that we can work out of. 
NORM The Hallelujah Mountains? 
GRACE That's right. 
NORM Yesssss! (off Jake's look) The legendary Floating Mountains of Pandora? Heard of them? CUT TO: 
EXT. RAINFOREST - AERIAL - DAY 
A SAMSON THUNDERS over the rainforest, climbing into the mist- shrouded mountains. 
In the SEALED COCKPIT, Norm is up front, sitting left seat so Trudy can talk him through the flight controls. Jake and Grace are behind them, in the jump-seats. 
Grace and Norm's UNCONSCIOUS AVATARS ride in the open back compartment. 
TRUDY It only takes tiny inputs.   Here, put your hand on the cyclic -- 
She points to the stick between her knees. Norm hesitantly reaches over and rests his hand on hers. 
TRUDY Feel how small the moves are? You barely have to think it, and the aircraft reacts. 
ON NORM -- reacting to tiny inputs from the hot lady-pilot. 
THE SAMSON is dwarfed by enormous ARCHES OF ROCK. 
GRACE See these magnetic formations.   We're getting close. 
TRUDY Yeah we are. Look at my instruments. 
On the dash, many of the displays are fritzing out. 
GRACE Yup. We're in the flux vortex. 
AHEAD, a cloud bank parts, revealing -- 
THE HALLELUJAH MOUNTAINS.   Right in front of them. 
NORM Oh. My. God. 
Jake leans forward between the seatbacks for a good look out the front canopy. 
JAKE'S POV -- enormous islands of rock are hovering a half mile above the ground. They are overgrown with rainforest, and straggly beards of vines hang down beneath them. Waterfalls stream down the sides and dissolve into spray at the bottom. 
NEYTIRI stands next to him, correcting his position as he draws a longbow. 
BARKING commands, she SMACKS him on the shoulder, then the elbow, repositioning him roughly. 
JAKE (V.O.) Neytiri thinks I'm some kind of retard. 
HUMAN JAKE emerges from the LINK to see -- 
TRUDY and NORM caught IN THE ACT on Norm's bunk. Norm blushes and Trudy waves, pulling the blanket over their heads. 
JAKE (V.O.) Norm's attitude has improved lately. 
NORM works with JAKE at the small table in the SHACK kitchen. 
NORM Thank you? 
JAKE Ireiyo. 
Norm comically exaggerates the pronunciation. 
NORM Irrrreiyo. Irrrreiyo.   You've gotta roll the R, r-r-r-oll it. 
Norm makes Jake repeat the word, getting more frustrated. 
JAKE (V.O.) It's good he's back on board, but he thinks I'm a retard too. 
TRACKING WITH JAKE'S FEET as he runs over rocks, leaping onto a thick root, running on across the rough bark. 
JAKE (V.O.) My feet are getting tougher.   I can run farther every day. 
Neytiri leads him along a massive root, and soon they are running 30 meters above the ground. 
He sprints with her through the trees, trying to keep up. She CLIMBS and LEAPS with the ease of a spider monkey. 
JAKE (V.O.) I have to trust my body to know what to do. With Neytiri it's learn fast or die. 
Neytiri LEAPS off into space, falling, falling until -- 
She catches an enormous palm leaf and, gripping it, allows its DROOP to slow her fall. She lets go, plummeting, and catches another. 
JAKE FOLLOWS in a leap of faith. THE CAMERA PLUNGES with him, from leaf to leaf, down and down in a dizzying kinetic rush. 
He drops down from the last leaf, landing next to her on a game trail. He is exhilarated to still be alive. 
Neytiri is surprised -- that he followed.   That he lived. 
TIGHT ON HUMAN JAKE, in the shack. Thinking as he looks at the pictures of Grace with the laughing kids at the school. 
IN THE COMMONS -- AVATAR NORM formally greets MO'AT. The Matriarch looks on as GRACE kneels to hug children she knows. Grace's eyes sparkle as she chats with them in Na'vi. 
JAKE (V.O.) I sweet-talked Mo'at into giving Norm and Grace a hall pass. Now Grace even makes me coffee before link every morning. 
Grace looks up to see Neytiri approaching. It is an awkward moment between them. Grace makes the formal gesture of greeting. 
GRACE (Na'vi, subtitled) I See you, Neytiri Mo'at'ite. 
NEYTIRI I See you, Doctor Grace Augustine. 
ANOTHER DAY -- NEYTIRI kneels on a game trail, pointing out the tracks in the mud to Jake. She touches the edges of the plants around her, and sniffs the air. 
JAKE (V.O.) I'm learning to read the trails, the tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest scents and sounds. 
JAKE AND NEYTIRI watch through a screen of leaves as -- 
A HERD of huge, armored STURMBEEST walks through the shallows of a lake. In the middle of the herd, the babies are sheltered from predators among their parents' legs. 
One of the BULLS trumpets, and a flock of TETRAPTERONS takes flight, an explosion of purple wings. 
Jake stares at the strange and wild alien tableau. 
ANOTHER PLACE -- NEYTIRI STANDS utterly still, except for her ears, which move with a life of their own. Her eyes are closed. She speaks very softly to Jake -- 
NEYTIRI When you hear nothing, you will hear everything. When you see nothing, you will See everything. 
JAKE (V.O.) Sometimes I have no idea what she's talking about. 
Jake and Neytiri creep quietly, stalking a large male HEXAPEDE -- a six legged deer-like creature. 
Jake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as Neytiri watches. He takes a bead on the hexapede -- tracks it for a beat with the drawn bow, then RELAXES his arm. Zen archery. 
JAKE (V.O.) It's been a month and I'm still not allowed to make a kill. She says the forest hasn't given permission. 
OMIITED 
NEYTIRI and JAKE crawl through the undergrowth.   She points and he parts some leaves to see -- 
A MOTHER VIPERWOLF bringing meat to her cubs, which frisk around her legs. She licks their faces. 
JAKE (V.O.) There's a lot of crap like that. She's always going on about the flow of energy-- the spirits of the animals and what not -- 
VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- HUMAN JAKE talks into the lens.    He's changing -- un-shaven, cheeks hollow. Pale. 
JAKE (SMIRKING) I just hope this treehugger shit isn't on the final. 
Visible behind him, Grace is hunched over her samples. 
GRACE (without looking up) This isn't just about eye-hand coordination out there. You need to listen to what she says. Try to see the forest through their eyes. 
JAKE Excuse me -- this is my video-log here, okay? 
NEYTIRI AND JAKE move through the NIGHT FOREST, surrounded by galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence. They move gracefully, soundlessly -- two forest spirits. 
CU JAKE -- the pupils of his cat eyes dilated. The night forest floods his brain with its million bio-sources. 
NIGHT SHOT, from overhead -- Jake and Neytiri bow-fishing from a dugout canoe over huge glowing ANEMONES at the bottom of a pool. 
A large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow.      ZAP! Jake drills it. He holds up the fish, triumphantly. 
ANOTHER DAY -- Neytiri stands close behind Jake, adjusting his position as he draws his bow. Only now her hands are GENTLE as they move on his arms, his shoulders. 
Aware of her touch, Jake's focus is broken.   Their eyes meet, and she pulls away quickly. 
NIGHT -- they enter a CLEARING filled with chest-high ferns. Neytiri signals him to move slowly. They approach a creature on one of the ferns. An ugly, stick-like LIZARD-THING perched on a frond. As he approaches -- 
SNAP! A long spine whips in a circle, unfurling a bioluminescent membrane -- a disk a meter across, opening like a Chinese fan. It FLIES OFF, a living Frisbee. 
JAKE looks down -- the massive trunk dwindles to the size of a licorice stick. A chunk breaks off a boulder as he climbs over it -- it floats upward. 
They reach the upper branches of the beanstalk. Above them, the craggy underbelly of MONS Veritatis looms. Spray from one of the waterfalls hits them. 
Some of the HANGING VINES are brushing over the upper branches of the beanstalk with a crackling hiss. 
One by one the hunters grab onto vines as they pass. 
Jake shrugs and leaps to a passing vine, his feet dangling over nothingness. They climb toward the floating islands above. 
EXT. MONS VERITATIS - DAY 
TINY FIGURES cross a causeway of vines connecting a small island of unobtanium to the main mass of Mons Veritatis. 
WIDE SHOT looking down a rock face bigger than Half Dome -- the sheer side of Mons Veritatis. 
Banshees circle next to the cliffs, flashing in shafts of sunlight. Waterfalls dissolve into nothingness below. 
EXT. GROTTO/BANSHEE ROOKERY - DAY 
A waterfall THUNDERS down into the void like a faucet of the gods. Jake looks down the sheer cliff at the world far below -- a view from Olympus. 
A SHRIEK and the THWAP THWAP of leathery wings -- NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE swoops in to perch at the edge of the grotto. She dismounts and, like a falconer, covers its eyes with a woven HOOD. It waits, docile, as -- 
She joins Jake and the hunter party. Tsu'tey leads them through the cave until they emerge onto a CLIFF FACE. And Jake sees -- 
The BANSHEE ROOKERY. HUNDREDS of banshees huddle on rock out- croppings as far as the eye can see. They cling to the walls with the fore-claws on their wings, or perch on ledges. 
TSU'TEY Jakesully will go first. 
Tsu'tey smirks at Jake, a challenge in his eyes. The two teenage Hunters are scared but trying to act tough. 
Tsu'tey scowls when Neytiri leads Jake out onto the ledge. 
NEYTIRI (WHISPERING) Now you choose your ikran. This you must feel -- inside. If he also chooses you, move quick, like I showed. You will have one chance. 
JAKE How will I know if he chooses me? 
NEYTIRI He will try to kill you. 
JAKE Outstanding. 
Out of sight of Tsu'tey, Neytiri takes his hand and squeezes it. Jake feels a rush of emotion, but she breaks away like it didn't happen. He is on his own, on the ledge with -- 
The BANSHEES. They eye him as he approaches. Several SHRIEK and take flight. Others flap their wings and yawn, showing rows of fangs, in a threat display. 
Jake unrolls a weighted leather strap, like a one-ended BOLO. 
A LARGE MALE spreads enormous wings, SHRIEKS, and glares straight at him. 
Jake looks directly into its eyes -- and strides toward it. 
JAKE Let's dance. 
The challenged banshee HISSES and leaps at him, jaws wide as-- 
Jake times the lunge, swinging the bolo, feinting and then slipping aside as the banshee's jaws miss him, SNAPPING SHUT. 
Jake WHAPS the bolo across its snout. The weighted thong whips twice around its long jaws, tying them shut. A MUFFLED SCREAM and it SLASHES at his stomach with razor talons but -- 
Jake is already leaping, over the talons and tackling the banshee around the neck. It topples on its side, and he SWARMS IT -- arms around its thrashing head. 
Jake grabs its whip-like antenna and brings it toward his queue but -- 
The bony head SLAMS sideways, and BAM! -- clocks him right in the face, almost knocking him out and -- 
IT WRITHES, flinging him to the ground. He slides on the rock and almost goes over the edge as -- 
NEYTIRI gasps. Tsu'tey laughs and yells mockingly. 
The bolo is coming loose as the creature shakes its head, way pissed off now, but -- 
Jake scrambles up and leaps straight at it. Claws rake his leg but he gets his arms around its head and CLAMPS DOWN HARD. They flop to the ground and he scrambles on top, pinning it and -- 
Grabs its whipping antenna, locks it under his arm, and jams the end of his queue into it. They FUSE together and -- 
The banshee stops struggling. It lies there panting.   They are locked together, literally eye to eye. 
JAKE That's right! You're mine. 
ECU BANSHEE -- the pupil like a deep black well. 
Jake relaxes his grip and slowly, warily, slides his leg over the creature's back. 
Neytiri runs to him. 
NEYTIRI First flight seals the bond. You cannot wait. 
Jake sits astride the creature, feeling its power.   He grips a hank of the beast's main, and -- 
JAKE Heeeyyyaaaah! 
THWAP! THWAP! The banshee is off like a shot. Jake SCREAMS as they PLUMMET off the cliff -- the banshee WAILS and -- 
They fall together, spiralling out of control, and he is almost tossed lose. The thing is SQUAWKING and SHRIEKING so much he can't think. 
JAKE Shut the hell up!! 
It does. 
JAKE Level out!     Fly straight! 
It levels out. Jake cocks his head, only thinking "bank left" and the animal complies. He settles the banshee into an easy loping beat of its huge wings, while he catches his breath. 
NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE falls into formation with him.   She signals "follow me" and DIVES. 
Jake guides his banshee clumsily after her. Neytiri's banshee moves with precise movements of its wingtips, while Jake's wobbles and dips, almost falling out of the sky. 
THE CAMERA SWOOPS after them as Neytiri leads an arcing DIVE around the flank of Mons Veritatis. The scenery is stunning. They pass waterfalls and swoop between hanging vines. 
Neytiri leads Jake in a sharp bank, skimming close to the cliffs. They punch through streamers of cloud and emerge into sunlight. 
Jake is getting the hang of it. He jinks left, then right, then dives, tucking himself tight against the animal's back. He's reckless, fearless. Half in control and LOVING IT. 
Neytiri dives next to him as he lets out a long WHOOP of joy. CUT TO: 
BELOW, seemingly in the womb of the earth, Jake walks slowly into the center of a tight circle of seated elders and hunters. An ELDER is slowly rapping a large WATER DRUM. 
TIME CUT -- MO'AT purifies him with smoke from burning herbs, CHANTING in a low monotone. Jake, squatting, washes the smoke over himself with his palms. 
MACRO - MO'AT'S FINGERS unwrap a piece of wood riddled with holes. She catches the end of a glowing purple WORM, and draws it out of the wood. 
MO'AT (SUBTITLED) Oh wise worm, eater of the Sacred Tree -- bless this worthy Hunter with a true vision. 
MO'AT places the worm on Jake's out-stretched TONGUE. It twists on itself, lighting his mouth before he closes it. She indicates he should chew. He does. 
MACRO -- AN EARTHEN JAR is opened. EYTUKAN removes a writhing black ARACHNOID, the Pandoran equivalent of a scorpion. 
He places it against the back of Jake's neck and presses. The insect drives its stinger into Jake's skin and -- 
Jake grimaces. Mo'at and Eytukan step back, leaving Jake alone in the circle. 
Neytiri watches intently, joining in the low chant. 
SLOW DOLLY IN on Jake. His eyes OPEN. He looks around at the faces -- they seem to TRANSFORM, becoming threatening. 
Jake looks down at the palms of his hands. 
JAKE'S POV -- his hands recede, his whole body, the ground and -- 
INSTANTLY the circle of Na'vi recedes, as if to a distant horizon, leaving vast ground in between. SPACE is utterly distorted, and SOUND as well -- echoing, THUNDEROUS. 
ECU JAKE -- pupils DILATED black. He looks around and -- 
The onlookers are gone, replaced by a ring of glowing trees, which seem miles high. The whole image is bathed in spectral radiance. Jake looks down -- 
JAKE'S POV -- his body and hands transforming -- fingers stretching into tendrils, legs becoming roots which spread outward across the ground, a thousand glowing dendrites which connect to the roots of the trees and -- 
CUT TO REALITY -- Jake is on his hands and knees, PUKING in the dirt. He contorts, crying out in agony as the venom contracts his muscles but -- 
IN HIS VISION Jake stands serene on a FLOATING MOUNTAIN CLIFF. A GREAT BLACK SHADOW covers him, the unmistakable X silhouette of a diving LEONOPTERYX. The LAST SHADOW. 
CAMERA SCREAMS down on him as the shadow grows larger -- WE RUSH into his face, into the blackness of his pupil which FILLS THE UNIVERSE and -- 
REAL JAKE writhes in the dirt, his back arched as his muscles seize. He foams and thrashes, his eyes rolled back in his head, while inside -- 
TIME ITSELF HAS ACCELERATED -- clouds scream around the mountain tops, mist boils through the forest. He feels the wind of time blowing through him as -- 
REAL JAKE claws the ground, moaning, staring blindly while -- 
INSIDE, IN POV he FLIES over the landscape of Pandora -- 
--but the forest is BLASTED. Fires flicker among trees that are BURNED black and lifeless in a smoky twilight. 
A great WINGED SHADOW is cast below, rippling over the devastated ground. AVATAR JAKE looks down at the shadow. Realizes HE is casting it, and we RUSH IN to his PUPIL and -- 
PULL BACK from the eye of a GREAT LEONOPTERYX, flying lordly and terrible over the land. It lets out an almighty SHRIEK which seems to echo to eternity and -- 
SLAM CUT to Jake, on his back, GASPING -- back in his body. He weakly rolls up to one elbow and looks around the room. 
MO'AT It is finished. 
Neytiri's face is flooded with relief.   The faces of the clan elders look at Jake expectantly. 
EYTUKAN (SUBTITLED) Did your Spirit Animal come? 
Jake looks from Eytukan to Mo'at, Tsu'tey and the elders. How can he tell them what he has seen? 
Mo'at puts her splayed fingers against his face, seeming to peer into his troubled soul. 
MO'AT (to Jake) Something has come. (to the others, subtitled) It will take time for the meaning to be clear. 
She steps back, and Eytukan motions for Jake to stand. He gets up, weakly. 
OUTSIDE THE ENCLOSURE -- Eytukan emerges with Jake and the others. The entire clan is gathered, waiting to hear what has happened. Jake looks up at the Leonopteryx Skull Totem, which seems to stare down at him. 
GRACE watches, her eyes brimming. Proud. Relieved. Amazed. 
Eytukan places both hands on Jake's chest and holds them there. 
EYTUKAN (SUBTITLED) You are now a son of the Omaticaya.   You are part of the People. 
All the members of the clan press forward, crowding around and putting their hands on Jake's shoulders, back, chest -- hands upon hands, until he is connected to everyone. DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT 
JAKE and NEYTIRI run silhouetted in the night. Behind them waterfalls cascade down in the silvery light. POLYPHEMUS RISES behind the trees. 
NEYTIRI DIVES from a rock, slicing into a mirror of water. Jake follows her and -- 
UNDERWATER, they swim over glowing ANEMONES. 
They seem to float in a cosmic dance above a luminous garden of waving shapes. Tiny purple fish swirl around them. 
Their hands come together, fingers twining, as they float weightlessly, as if between worlds. DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. WILLOW GLADE 
Laughing, they run together into a stand of WILLOWS. Their trunks are as gnarled as bonsai. Long faintly glowing tendrils hang straight down in pastel curtains. 
Underfoot, a bed of moss glows faintly. It REACTS to their footsteps with expanding rings of light. 
It is an exquisitely beautiful spot. 
The willows stir, responding to their presence. She holds up her hands, letting the TENDRILS caress her. 
NEYTIRI This is a place for prayers to be heard. And sometimes answered. 
Jake puts out his hands and the tendrils play over his fingers, his palms, his forearms. His eyes go wide. We hear the WHISPERING of ancient Na'vi VOICES. 
JAKE It's like -- a sound you feel. 
NEYTIRI We call this utraya mokri -- the Tree of Voices. The voices of our ancestors, who live within Eywa. 
A few WOODSPRITES circle around them, some alighting on their shoulders and arms. 
They stand, very close together now. Her eyes are intense, almost luminous. He feels drawn into them. 
But she pulls back a little. 
NEYTIRI You are Omaticaya now. You may make your own bow from the wood of Hometree. (she looks away) And you may choose a woman. 
He positions himself where the camera-eyes of the robotic juggernaut will see him. 
INT. OPS CENTER - DAY 
CLOSE ON MONITOR -- Jake shouts but there's no sound feed. 
WIDER as the TRACTOR OPERATOR sees him and pulls back on the remote throttles. He yells to his SUPERVISOR. 
OPERATOR Hey, I got one of the natives blockin' my blade here. 
This attracts the attention of Selfridge, who comes over to the workstation. 
ON THE SCREEN -- Jake, in his Omaticaya loincloth and ceremonial body paint, is unrecognizable. 
SUPERVISOR (to Selfridge) What do we do? 
SELFRIDGE Roll on. He'll move. These people have to learn that we don't stop. 
TIGHT ON THROTTLES as the operator pushes them forward. 
ON THE SCREEN Jake stumbles back, tripping, disappears below the blade for a second -- reappears, running to the side. 
EXT. WILLOW GLADE 
JAKE grabs a rock and LEAPS onto the dozer.   He climbs quickly to the CAMERA MAST. 
SMASH! The rock crashes into the lens of the camera. Jake beats the rock furiously against it, pounding it to junk. 
INT. OPS CENTER 
CLOSE ON MONITOR -- as Jake's demonic face is replaced by noise. 
OPERATOR I'm blind. 
He pulls back on the throttles. 
EXT. WILLOW GLADE 
THE JUGGERNAUT grinds to a stop. But the ROAR of engines continues because -- 
MORE DOZERS and TRACTORS advance nearby, crushing the forest before them. Trees are slashed down by the PLASMA CUTTERS. Terrified animals flee before the onslaught. 
POWERSUITS and TROOPERS stride through the ravaged forest, blasting anything that moves. A trooper sees Jake on the dozer. He rips off a BURST and -- 
Rounds CLANG into metal as Jake dives off the machine. He grabs Neytiri and they run into concealing foliage. From behind a screen of leaves, they watch as -- 
THE DOZERS advance, obliterating the sacred site, leaving only mud and wood splinters in their path. 
CU NEYTIRI, stunned by the nightmarish, unfathomable wrongness of it. She sobs as the willows die. 
INT. OPS CENTER 
MINUTES LATER, the operator is playing back the CAMERA'S FEED for Quaritch and the others. 
QUARITCH Freeze it, right -- there. 
ON MONITOR -- the image expands, until Jake's face is clear, frozen in an animal snarl. 
SELFRIDGE Son of a bitch! 
PUSH IN ON QUARITCH as his jaw clenches in cold fury. 
He turns and strides toward the door, shouting to his WATCH COMMANDER as he passes. 
QUARITCH Get me a pilot! CUT TO: 
INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - DAY 
A RAIDING PARTY of hunters, their bodies painted, raise weapons overhead. AVATAR GRACE watches with growing alarm. 
EYTUKAN (SUBTITLED) Tsu'tey will lead the war party! 
Tsu'tey steps forward, face full of hate, raising a war cry among the hunters. 
GRACE (SUBTITLED) Please -- this will only make it worse -- 
TSU'TEY You do not speak here! 
JAKE and NEYTIRI cross the commons toward them. Jake feels all eyes turn toward him. He takes her arm, stopping her. 
JAKE (to Neytiri, low) Okay, listen. There's something I have to tell you. It's gonna be hard. I just need you to -- 
He sees TSU'TEY striding toward them, his face a mask of fury. 
TSU'TEY You! 
Tsu'tey walks right up and SLAMS Jake in the chest with both hands. It is so unexpected, that Jake topples on his ass. 
TSU'TEY You mated with this woman?! 
GRACE Oh shit. 
Jake stands. He reaches out for Neytiri.   She goes to him, clutching his hand. 
MO'AT Is this true? 
NEYTIRI (SUBTITLED) We are mated before Eywa. It is done. 
Tsu'tey turns to Mo'at and Eytukan, his face anguished. 
TSU'TEY (SUBTITLED) Neytiri was promised to me! Everything is changing. Everything is being destroyed! 
Tsu'tey points at Jake, his pain shifting to rage. 
TSU'TEY (SUBTITLED) These aliens kill everything they touch, like poison. 
MO'AT Neytiri! If you choose this path, you can never be Tsahik. Your life will be wasted. 
Neytiri looks at her mother -- sees the grief in her eyes. 
NEYTIRI I have chosen. 
Tsu'tey draws his knife and -- 
TSU'TEY Yeeeeeaaa! 
GRACE Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot me? (to Selfridge) You need to muzzle your dog! 
SELFRIDGE Can we just take this down a couple notches, please. 
JAKE (to Quaritch) You say you want to keep your people alive. Start by listening to her. 
Jake nods to Grace to continue. 
GRACE (to Selfridge) This is bad, Parker. Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you can't imagine. 
SELFRIDGE You know what? You throw a stick in the air around here it falls on some sacred fern. 
GRACE I'm not talking about pagan voodoo here -- I'm talking about something real and measurable in the biology of the forest. 
SELFRIDGE (FRUSTRATED) Which is what exactly? 
Grace's nerve fails. A rush of conflicting emotions -- the need to act, to do something, colliding with her scientific rigor. 
GRACE (to Jake) I can't do this. How am I supposed to reduce years of work to a sound bite for the illiterate? 
JAKE Just tell him what you know in your heart. 
She turns to Parker, steeling herself. 
GRACE Alright, look -- I don't have the answers yet, I'm just now starting to even frame the questions. What we think we know -- is that there's some kind of electrochemical communication between the roots of the trees. Like the synapses between neurons. Each tree has ten to the fourth connections to the trees around it, and there are ten to the twelfth trees on Pandora -- 
SELFRIDGE That's a lot I'm guessing. 
GRACE That's more connections than the human brain. You get it? It's a network -- a global network. And the Na'vi can access it -- they can upload and download data -- memories -- at sites like the one you destroyed. 
SELFRIDGE What the hell have you people been smoking out there? They're just. Goddamn. Trees. 
GRACE You need to wake up, Parker. The wealth of this world isn't in the ground -- it's all around us. The Na'vi know that, and they're fighting to defend it. If you want to share this world with them, you need to understand them. 
QUARITCH We understand them just fine.   Thanks to Jake here. 
Jake shares a look of alarm with Grace as Quaritch selects a NEW CLIP on the main monitor -- 
TIGHT ON MONITOR -- VIDEO-LOG IMAGE of Jake, looking haggard and borderline deranged, rambling in a late-night monologue. 
JAKE (RECORDED) They're not going to give up their home -- they're not gonna make a deal. For what? Lite beer and shopping channel? There's nothing we have that they want. We're a horror to them. We're the monsters from space. 
JAKE watches with a growing dread as his words condemn the people he has grown to love. 
JAKE (RECORDED) They're never going to leave Hometree. 
Quaritch FREEZES the recording. 
QUARITCH Since a deal can't be made -- it gets real simple. (to Jake, icily) So thanks. I'm getting all emotional.    I might just give you a big wet kiss. 
GRACE Parker, we have to talk, like rational people. 
SELFRIDGE Well, I'd cherish that, but unfortunately you're out of here on the next shuttle. All of you. I'm shutting down the Avatar Program, effective now. 
ON JAKE, GRACE AND NORM, speechless. SLOW DISSOLVE TO: 
A WALL OF FIRE. Silhouettes of direhorse riders cross in SLOW MOTION, spears and bows held high. 
INT. OPS CENTER - MORNING 
MONITOR SCREEN IMAGE -- WAINFLEET pans a camera across the smoldering hulks of BURNED DOZERS. The toppled remains of a charred ampsuit. Dead troopers bristling with arrows. 
WAINFLEET They hit with banshees first. Set the ampsuit on fire. Driver's toast. 
Quaritch and Selfridge look on grimly. 
QUARITCH The rest of the squad? 
WAINFLEET Six bodies -- that's all of `em. And the equipment is totalled. 
SELFRIDGE Christ. 
INT. SELFRIDGE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Selfridge is stares soberly as Quaritch outlines the plan. 
QUARITCH I can do it with minimal casualties to the indigenous. We'll clear them out with gas first. It'll be humane. More or less. 
Selfridge sighs and rubs his face. 
QUARITCH Hey, don't go limp on me now. This is exactly the incident we needed. 
SELFRIDGE Alright, let's pull the trigger. CUT TO: 
INT. BIO LAB 
MAX and the lab staff are glumly packing files and equipment, under the watchful eye of armed SEC-OPS TROOPERS. JAKE, GRACE, NORM stare bleakly at each other. 
GRACE They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose, to trigger a response. They're fabricating this war to get what they want. 
NORM I can't believe that. 
JAKE Yup. That's how it's done. When people are sitting on shit you want, you make them your enemy. Then you're justified in taking it. 
TRUDY RUNS into the lab, breathless. She's wearing full flight gear and carrying her helmet. 
TRUDY Sec-ops is rolling the gunships.   They're gonna hit Hometree! 
JAKE When? 
TRUDY Now.    We're spooling up now! I gotta go. 
GRACE My God. 
Jake pumps furiously toward the door, Grace following. 
INT. OPS CENTER - DAY 
SELFRIDGE surveys the airfield, where crews swarm over the gunships, loading ordnance. He turns as JAKE and GRACE charge toward him. 
GRACE Parker, wait. Stop! These are people you're about to -- 
SELFRIDGE They're fly-bitten savages who live in a tree! Look around -- I don't know about you but I see a lot of trees. They can move. 
GRACE For God's sake, there are children in there. Babies! 
MO'AT You are one of us.   Help us! 
Jake takes the knife and cuts Grace free. 
JAKE We've gotta move!    He's gonna blow the columns. 
As Grace realizes what he means, he grabs her and they RUN. Around them the Omaticaya flee in horror and confusion. 
IN THE COCKPIT, Quaritch watches as the Omaticaya stream away from the Great Tree, running along roots and branches. 
QUARITCH That's how you scatter the roaches. Okay, switch missiles. Give me H-E's at the base of the west columns. 
PILOTS (V.O.) Copy, switching missiles. 
IN TRUDY'S SAMSON -- she hears the other pilots acknowledging Quaritch's order. 
TRUDY Screw it. 
She takes her finger OFF the fire-control and pulls her aircraft out of formation. 
PUSHING IN ON QUARITCH, the Hometree reflecting in his glasses. 
QUARITCH Bring it down. 
MISSILES stream down from the DRAGON and the other gunships and -- 
The base of Hometree VANISHES in a chain of HIGH-EXPLOSIVE BLASTS. The massive PILLARS fragment into matchsticks, and -- 
The Omaticaya watch in horror as -- 
HOMETREE GROANS and starts to MOVE. 
In a cacophony of cracking, splintering roots, the mighty tree TOPPLES with agonizing slowness. 
AT THE BANSHEE EYRIE, TSU'TEY and the other hunters spur their mounts into flight. They swoop among the branches as the tree, the one fixed thing in their lives, MOVES. 
It CRASHES DOWN through the forest canopy, crushing the lesser trees in its path, FALLING PONDEROUSLY. 
HOMETREE hits the ground like the end of the world, raising a great cloud of dust and pulverized debris. 
IN THE DRAGON cockpit, Quaritch surveys the destruction. 
QUARITCH Nice work people. Alright, let's light it up. 
INCENDIARIES launch from the gunships, EXPLODING into gouts of FIRE in the debris of Hometree. 
THE GUNSHIPS fan the flames through the trees like a fire- storm. The Omaticaya retreat as a WALL OF FIRE advances. 
JAKE SEARCHES for Neytiri amid swirling smoke and sparks. 
JAKE Neytiri!   Neytiri! 
GRACE is gathering crying CHILDREN, and herding them away from the fire-storm. 
NEYTIRI stumbles through the burning wreckage at the edge of the INFERNO. She sees -- 
EYTUKAN. A large shard of wood is driven through him like a spear. He recognizes her as she kneels over him. 
EYTUKAN (SUBTITLED) Daughter -- take my bow. Protect the People. 
In his last living moment he places his bow in her hands. 
She collapses over him, her face crumpling in grief. 
JAKE reels out of the smoke.    Kneels next to her. 
JAKE I'm sorry -- 
She shoves him away and stands, screaming at him as tears stream down her face. 
NEYTIRI Get away from me, Jake. Go away! Never come back! 
Jake stumbles back as she slumps down by her father's body. Sparks and smoke swirl around him. He watches as -- 
NETYIRI kneels, grieving. Slumped over, clutching her stomach. Keening like an animal. 
SLOW MOTION -- Jake staggers lost and alone through the burning forest. Utterly shattered. Eyes vacant. 
JAKE (V.O.) I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace. Sooner or later though, you always have to wake up... 
INT. LINK ROOM 
SELFRIDGE watches a video feed of the destruction on one of the monitors. Max and NORM stare in shock. 
SELFRIDGE Pull the plug. 
A TROOPER crosses to the console and grabs the handle of the MASTER BREAKER -- 
EXT. RAINFOREST 
The strings are cut. Jake flops to the ground, limp. 
Elsewhere in the smoky Hell, Grace slumps unconscious. The crying kids pull at her. Mo'at, leading a group of Omaticaya, comes upon the scene. 
She grabs the kids and pulls them away, leaving Grace's avatar helpless in the path of the flames. She hesitates, then -- 
MO'AT (SUBTITLED) Bring her. 
INT. LINK ROOM 
BLACKNESS. Then the top clamshell of Jake's unit is yanked upward, and troopers grab him, zip-tie his wrists as we -- CUT TO: 
EXT. RAINFOREST - DUSK 
ON A HILLSIDE -- a grieving Neytiri stands with Mo'at and the Omaticaya refugees. Two hunters pull Grace's avatar on a travois. 
They watch as the flames burn like a funeral pyre below. A great pall of smoke darkens the landscape. DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. LOCK-UP - NIGHT 
Jake, Grace, and Norm are in a common holding cell. They sit, staring in silence. Too wired to sleep, too emotionally drained to move. 
GRACE They never wanted us to succeed. 
AT THE DESK OUTSIDE, the lone TROOPER looks up as -- 
Trudy is flying on visual only, by the light of Polyphemus. Her instruments are showing gibberish. 
TRUDY Well, at least they won't be able to track us up here. Not this deep in the vortex. 
JAKE It's strongest at the Well of Souls, right? 
TRUDY Yeah. 
JAKE Good, `cause that's where we're going. 
TRUDY Copy. 
He gives Grace an ampule of morphine for the pain. 
JAKE I'm gonna get you some help, Grace. 
GRACE Forget it, it doesn't matter. 
Jake grabs her shoulders. 
JAKE No!   The People can help you. I know it. CUT TO: 
EXT. WELL OF SOULS - AERIAL - DAWN 
Dawn light paints the massive ARCHES of magnetic rock above the Well of Souls. 
Tiny as an insect, the SAMSON passes. 
JAKE (V.O.) The Well of Souls. The heart of the forest. I knew the People would go there. 
EXT. WELL OF SOULS - DAWN 
The WELL OF SOULS is a deep caldera 100 meters across. It is ringed with enormous WILLOWS whose roots seem to pour down the sheer rock walls like candle wax. 
AT THE BOTTOM, in a natural amphitheater, the Omaticaya refugees are clustered around a central rock outcropping which forms a kind of dais and altar. 
Shafts of dawn light reach to the bottom of the grotto, lighting a single willow -- the MOTHER TREE. Ancient and gnarled, it grows in the center of the rock. 
Its ROOTS spread down to the grotto floor, where they merge with the roots of the willows ringing the Well -- forming a braided mat resembling the surface of a brain. 
Mo'at stands on the dais, leading them in a CHANT. 
MO'AT (SUBTITLED) Wise ancestors who live within Eywa, guide us. Give us a sign. CUT TO: 
EXT. FOREST CLEARING   - DAWN 
The shack descends from the sky like a gift from the gods. It bumps to the ground. CUT TO: 
INT. SHACK -- DAY 
Grace lies, comatose, in her open link. Trudy gives Jake a look that says "not much time." Jake feels Grace's cold forehead, then crosses to his own link. 
As Trudy helps him in, Norm rapidly preps the system. 
NORM (LOW) Tsu'tey is Olo'eyctan now. He's not going to let you get near that place. 
JAKE I've gotta try, Norm. 
Jake pulls the clamshell down and we -- CUT TO: 
EXT. RUINS OF HOMETREE - DAY 
CU JAKE'S AVATAR -- HIS EYES OPEN. He sits up. The forest is silent, shrouded in smoke that the sun can't penetrate. The animals have fled. Ash blows on the wind. 
JAKE (V.O.) Outcast. Betrayer. Alien. To ever face them again, I was gonna have to change the rules. 
DISSOLVE -- JAKE reaches the top of a rise. The forest beyond is utterly DEVASTATED. The trees burned and fallen. Small fires still flicker across a landscape in Hell. 
JAKE stares. It is his vision, made real. He stumbles through the dark wasteland, sparks and ash swirling around him. 
A SCREECH.    Jake looks up as -- 
HIS BANSHEE -- bonded for life -- flaps down to a landing in front of him. He steps to it, and strokes its head. It nudges his chest like a horse. 
JAKE (V.O.) Sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move. 
JAKE Come on, boy. Time to fly. 
OMIITED 
EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY 
THE GREAT LEONOPTERYX glides effortlessly along the ridge where Jake and Neytiri first encountered him. 
It scans for prey below, its magnificent indigo-crested head cocking left, then right. 
JAKE (V.O.) The way I had it figured, Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky. Nothing attacks him. So why would he ever look up? 
FROM ABOVE -- THE SMALL SHADOW of Jake's banshee falls across the back of the mighty Toruk. 
JAKE (V.O.) But that was just a theory. 
JAKE DIVES and WE RUSH DOWN toward the great beast and our own shadow then -- CUT TO: 
EXT. WELL OF SOULS - LATE AFTERNOON 
The Omaticaya people lift their voices in a SONG filled with tragic loss and yearning for deliverance. 
CLOSE ON NEYTIRI, singing. A SHADOW CROSSES HER FACE.   She looks up, and her eyes go wide as -- 
A TERRIBLE CRY echoes, turning all eyes skyward.   AN ENORMOUS SHADOW covers the crowd as -- 
TORUK comes out of the sun, beating its huge wings to slow its descent. Its crimson and black wings, backlit by the sun, seem to glow from within. 
The People CRY OUT in alarm and scatter as the dreaded beast alights in their midst. And that's when they see -- 
JAKE, riding high on its shoulders, plugged-in to its antenna. It folds its wings and stands calmly amid the paralyzed Na'vi. 
Toruk lowers its body. They stare in awe as Jake dismounts and strokes the magnificent animal's flank. 
NEYTIRI, TSU'TEY and MO'AT watch in stunned amazement as the legendary Rider of Last Shadow walks toward them. 
NEYTIRI (breathing the words) Toruk Macto. 
Neytiri raises her arms. 
JAKE SPEAKS, the pain of Grace's death in the passion and fury of his voice. Tsu'tey TRANSLATES beside him. 
JAKE The Sky People have sent a message that they can take whatever they want, and no one can stop them. But we will send them a message. Ride out, as fast as the wind can carry you, tell the other clans to come. Tell them Toruk Macto calls to them. Fly now with me brothers and sisters! Fly! And we will show the Sky People that this is our land! 
TSU'TEY finishes with a bloodcurdling war-cry, and the entire CLAN responds, their shouts echoing across the forest. 
JAKE takes Neytiri's hand and runs to the leonopteryx.   He vaults onto its back and pulls her up behind him. 
THE HUNTERS run to their banshees, mounting quickly. Jake's leonopteryx rises on mighty wings into the night sky. With a thunder of wings, the banshees take off after it. 
LONG LENS -- POLYPHEMUS. Across its face, the banshees rise like a swarm of bats. Groups of riders peel off in different directions. CUT TO: 
EXT. CLAN GATHERING - NIGHT 
JAKE and NEYTIRI stand before the gathered members of ANOTHER CLAN. Jake speaks as she translates. We don't hear the words. 
TRACK ACROSS the faces of the clan, a sea of eyes in flickering fire-light. 
JAKE (V.O.) We rode out to the four winds. To the horse clans of the plain, to the ikran people of the mountains. When Toruk Macto called them, they came. 
VARIOUS ANGLES -- SLOW MOTION as riders vault onto their armored direhorses. Banshee riders raise spears and bows, spurring their mounts to leap skyward. CUT TO: 
EXT. WELL OF SOULS - DAWN 
With a WHOOSH and the crack of mighty wings, JAKE RETURNS. Jake and Neytiri alight from his legendary mount. 
Around them HUNDREDS OF BANSHEES are landing.   A gathering of eagles. 
FROM ABOVE we can see hundreds of Na'vi streaming down into the Well of Souls and many hundreds more camped in the forest above it. 
DIREHORSE RIDERS are arriving along many trails. 
BANSHEE RIDERS circle and swoop, darkening the sky above the grotto. 
JAKE, standing next to the Leonopteryx, watches his army gathering. CUT TO: 
INT. COMMISSARY - DAY 
It's standing room only as all base personnel are crowded into the dining hall. A portable 3D GRAPHICS PROJECTOR has been set up, and the lights are down. QUARITCH stands in front of the display image -- a classic pre-mission briefing. 
QUARITCH People, you are fighting for survival. There's an aboriginal horde out there massing for an attack. First slide. 
The display shows an overhead image of the Well of Souls.    It looks like Woodstock in the jungle. 
QUARITCH These orbital images show the hostiles' numbers have gone from a couple of hundred to over two thousand in one day, and more are pouring in. By next week it could be twenty thousand. Then they'll be overrunning our perimeter here. We can't wait. Our only security lies in pre- emptive attack. We will fight terror with terror. 
TRACKING ACROSS the grim faces of the miners and troopers. Fear transforming to hatred in their eyes. 
QUARITCH Next slide. This mountain stronghold is supposedly protected by their deity. When we destroy it, we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep they won't come within a thousand klicks of this place. CUT TO: 
INT. ARMOR BAY - DAY 
TROOPERS issue automatic weapons and magazines to a long line of mine workers. The miners lock and load like the red- blooded redneck NRA supporters they are. 
BLASTING TECHS are setting radio-detonated primer charges into two-ton stacks of EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND. The stacks are band-strapped together on pallets. 
TRACKING WITH SELFRIDGE, staring around him in growing dismay as he walks through the full-scale mobilization. 
He approaches Quaritch, who is barking orders amid a hive of activity around the ampsuits. 
SELFRIDGE This thing is completely out of control! 
Quaritch ignores him, turning away to focus on ordnance loading. 
SELFRIDGE Listen to me! I am not authorizing you to turn the mine-workers local into a freakin' militia! 
QUARITCH I declared threat condition red. That puts all on-world assets under my command. 
SELFRIDGE You think you can pull this palace coup shit on me?! I can have your ass with one call -- 
Quaritch grabs him and PINS him against the side of an ampsuit. 
QUARITCH You're a long way from Earth. 
Selfridge is paralyzed. Physical force -- against him? Quaritch releases him and walks away. 
QUARITCH (to his men) Get him out of here. 
Several troopers converge on Selfridge. 
SELFRIDGE You touch me you're so fired. 
He pushes through them and they escort him toward the door. CUT TO: 
INT. SHACK - DAY 
HUMAN JAKE, NORM and TRUDY are gathered around the comms monitor, talking to MAX. 
MAX I don't know how secure this channel is. 
JAKE Talk fast. 
MAX It's crazy here, Jake. It's full mobilization. They're rigging the shuttles as bombers. They've made up these big pallets of mine explosives. It's for some kind of shock and awe campaign. 
TRUDY Frickin' daisycutters. 
NORM Holy shit. 
JAKE (to Max) Can you talk to Selfridge? Maybe we can cut some kinda deal before this thing goes all the way. 
MAX No, Quaritch has taken over. He's rolling and there's no stopping him. 
JAKE When? 
MAX Oh six hundred tomorrow. 
Jake takes that in. 
JAKE Thanks. 
Max signs off. 
NORM We're screwed. 
TRUDY You know he's gonna commit those bombers straight to the Well of Souls. 
UP ANGLE as AMPSUITS descend from the Dragon on cables. Their massive feet smash down, and they march forward, leading the army into the forest. 
LYLE WAINFLEET, walking point in his hydraulic suit, scans his cockpit screens. He sees movement on the FLIR display -- ghostly THERMAL SIGNATURES. 
WAINFLEET Contact. Two hundred meters. 
A chilling SOUND echoes through the forest -- the ululating WAR CRIES of untold Na'vi. The troopers, look around, spooked. They can't tell where the sound is coming from. 
Then they feel it -- the GROUND ITSELF SHAKING.    They grip their weapons, bracing themselves as -- 
THREE HUNDRED NA'VI HORSEMEN charge through the forest at a full gallop, their hooves POUNDING the earth. It is an awesome sight. 
NORM SPELLMAN rides with the Na'vi hunters, carrying an assault rifle. 
THE NA'VI CHARGE thunders toward the human line.   The hunters raise their bows as -- 
THE AMPSUITS raise their GAU-90's. 
ON THE THERMAL IMAGERS target-cursors track the ghost riders. 
QUARITCH Fire for effect. 
The entire line of troopers opens fire. TRACERS riddle the jungle, blasting foliage into confetti. 
CHARGING DIREHORSES crash down, flipping over. Riders are flung off. The withering fire continues, and the ranks are decimated as -- 
RIDERS LAUNCH their arrows at a full gallop. A few hit their marks among the troopers. NORM FIRES his AR on full auto. 
TWO CHARGING DIREHORSES have a heavy log slung between them like a battering ram. At a full gallop they hit an ampsuit, FLIPPING IT onto its back with a blown-out canopy. Victory is short lived as the two riders are cut down. 
NORM'S HORSE is hit by tracer fire. He is flung off as the creature cartwheels. He hits hard, scrambling for cover as -- 
A WARRIOR HURLS his spear a moment before his horse is cut down. It SLAMS through an ampsuit's canopy but -- 
THE MERCILESS FIRE continues. Horses rear and collapse. Riders pivot their mounts to flee and -- 
THE THERMAL SCREENS show the remaining ghost riders scattering. 
LYLE signals and the line advances, firing sporadically at moving targets. 
OVERHEAD, NA'VI HUNTERS stream through the trees, running along the branches. 
As the troopers advance into bow range, the NA'VI open fire and -- 
TROOPERS SPROUT ARROWS in throat, legs, masks -- the targets Jake taught them, but -- 
THE FIRING LINE aims upward, tracking the THERMAL TARGETS. TRACERS rip through the foliage and -- 
NA'VI FALL while others retreat as bark and wood is blasted off the limbs beneath their feet. 
NORM sprints frantically through the woods, shouting into his HANDSET -- 
NORM Jake!   Jake! We're falling back! 
SURVIVING NA'VI flee the horrific onslaught.   It is a total rout. 
IN THE DRAGON, Quaritch catches glimpses of the figures streaming through the forest below. 
QUARITCH Blue team, switch forties.   Fire at will. 
Led by the Dragon, the gunships FIRE streamers of 40mm ROCKETS ahead of them. The jungle EXPLODES with HE bursts. Circular SHOCK WAVES flash outward through the jungle -- 
STROBOSCOPIC GLIMPSES of terrified horses rearing, Na'vi leaping, as the jungle rocks with the concussive onslaught. 
HUNTERS LOOK UP as a dark shape hovers overhead. The downblast of the VALKYRIE'S lift jets shreds the forest. 
INSIDE THE SHUTTLE'S cargo bay, a row of DAISYCUTTERS are lined up. Troopers roll the first pallet down the ramp. 
THE PALLET falls into the jungle below and -- 
BA-WHOOOOOM! -- an enormous high-explosive blast rips a huge hole in the forest. A white concussion wave flashes out across the ground for hundreds of meters in all directions. 
AT GROUND LEVEL it is an apocalypse. Running Na'vi are blasted out of existence by fire and shock waves. 
IN THE CARGO BAY the troopers WHOOP and high-five. 
TROOPERS Yeah baby!     Get some! 
GROUND TROOPS ADVANCE, firing flamethrowers, AR's and GAU- 90's. 
EXT. FLOATING MOUNTAINS - AERIAL 
Quaritch's fleet flies into the shadow of the Mountain of Truth. 
QUARITCH Blue team, stay with the ground units. Red team, with me. We're punching for the main target. 
Quaritch glances up to see -- 
A squadron of WINGED SHAPES, diving out of the morning glare like birds of prey. 
CLOSE ON JAKE, rushing straight down, SCREAMING a war cry as he leads the charge and -- 
SCORES OF BANSHEES SLAM into the gunships and Samsons like falcons hitting fat turkeys. The air battle is joined. 
JAKE'S GREAT LEONOPTERYX flairs into its signature crimson X shape just before -- 
K-WHAM!! -- it knocks a Scorpion tumbling. It coils around the gunship, slashing furiously as they spin together. JAKE can barely hang onto the gyrating creature. 
The pilot of the Scorpion sees nothing but jaws slamming into his canopy.   Jake releases the gunship and it careens into a CLIFF, tearing off one rotor -- then plummets into the trees. There is a satisfying FIREBALL. 
SCORPIONS fall out of formation to pursue individual banshee riders, FIRING cannons and rockets. 
JAKE BANKS as the cliff face next to him explodes with cannon rounds. SCREAMING down on him is another Scorpion. 
JAKE tucks and dives along the cliff, feeling the rounds splitting the air around him and -- 
The Scorpions bank after the furiously jinking banshees as they head for cover among the floating mountains, or dive down into the trees. 
DOOR GUNNERS in a SAMSON are shooting down banshees like Messerschmidts from a B-17 as -- 
WE FOLLOW TSU'TEY'S BANSHEE in a full delta dive. He swoops in from its blind spot and -- 
THE GUNNERS SWIVEL too late as Tsu'tey flashes past them, SHOOTING ARROWS with deadly accuracy. 
A SCORPION gunship dives after a banshee. It fires an air-to- air missile and the banshee vanishes in an EXPLOSION. 
THE TROOPERS open fire but -- the stampede drives over them like a wave. Tree-trunk feet shatter the ampsuit cockpits. Troopers are crushed or asphyxiated. 
NEARBY the foot-soldiers see LIVING SHADOWS flow out of the gloom as -- 
VIPERWOLVES race among them with flashing jaws. The troopers FIRE wildly as they go down, hitting each other as much as their attackers. 
The survivors break and run as more viperwolves bound out of the shadows. 
JAKE BANKS, watching as HUNDREDS of rider-less WILD BANSHEES converge on Quaritch's ships. They literally darken the sky. 
JAKE What the hell -- ? 
The wild banshees wheel among the ships, ripping into them. 
ON JAKE -- slowly getting it.   EYWA is in the fight. 
JAKE WHOO-HOOOO! 
A GUNNER fires from the door of a Samson. There is a CRASH and the head of a BANSHEE lunges in the open door, jerking him out. Other banshees tear at the pilot's windshield. 
NEYTIRI watches in awe as the ground troops scatter in disarray. The viperwolves flash past her, ignoring her. 
She senses something and turns slowly to see -- 
A THANATOR emerging from the smoke behind her. A glistening black demon. She stands paralyzed before its stygian gaze-- 
-- and the thanator lowers itself, until its head is just above the ground. It holds that position -- waiting. 
Trembling, she approaches the waiting demon. 
EXT. FOREST 
A smoky hell. Fires burn all around. The troopers are disorganized, falling back. Shooting at shadows. Panicked yelling fills the comm freq. 
WAINFLEET and another AMPSUIT are charging together through the smoky gloom. 
WAINFLEET A and C squads -- rally at my pos.   I want -- (screaming on the comm) Who's screaming God damn it?! 
TROOPER (ON RADIO) We gotta get outta here! Whoever's in charge, call for extraction! 
WAINFLEET Shutup you crybabies! 
SOMETHING slams into the other `suit, tackling it OUT OF FRAME. Wainfleet whirls to see his squad-mate missing. He moves through a screen of foliage to reveal -- 
The AMPSUIT -- ripped open. Driver gone. Blood inside the cockpit. He WHIRLS at a sound in time to see -- 
A THANATOR LEAPING straight at him -- WAINFLEET raises his cannon but-- 
WHAM!! It's on him, slamming him to the ground. The cannon goes flying. He's face to face with its nightmare jaws, right outside his canopy-- 
On its back is NEYTIRI, and it's a toss up which one looks more pissed off. The thanator rears back, muscles rippling as it poises to strike and -- 
K-KRAAACKK! Slams its teeth right through his canopy. Wainfleet's SCREAM is brief. 
Neytiri's demon mount rears up and its triumphant ROAR echoes through the forest. 
INT. CORRIDOR 
Max runs down the hall, leading the other scientists.   He's yelling into an AIRCOM HANDSET -- 
MAX Rogue One, Rogue One, this is Max.   Tell Jake we are in motion. (to the scientists) Get in there. Barricade the door! 
INT. LINK ROOM 
The door is hurled open and the SCIENTISTS charge in. 
Science geeks barricade the door as AVATAR-DRIVERS scramble into their link units, pulling the clamshells down. 
INT. CORRIDOR 
Max checks the door is secure from his side then runs down a connecting corridor. CUT TO: 
EXT. SHACK 
HUMAN NORM emerges from the airlock, wearing breathing gear and carrying an AR. He stumbles, dazed, toward the battle. 
EXT. MOUNTAINS/ AERIAL 
JAKE SIGNALS and a formation of hunters rolls in, diving at the lead shuttle, which is already besieged by winged creatures. 
THE CARGO RAMP is the scene of a pitched battle. Na'vi hunters hurl themselves off their mounts in waves, overwhelming the troopers. 
HUNTERS are shot, falling out of the ship, as others fly in. They shoot arrows and spears from the end of the ramp, and troopers fall back deeper into the fuselage. 
The panicked CREW CHIEF slams a switch and the ramp begins to close, a second before he is cut down by a spear. 
JAKE'S LEONOPTERYX plummets at the shuttle from behind. He swoops down, flairs to reduce speed, rolls off his mount and lands, tumbling on the shuttle's broad back as -- 
GUNNERS try to swing their guns toward him but he RAKES them with his AR, still running forward and -- 
JAKE PULLS two grenades from his battle harness, yanking the pins out with his teeth. He hurls them down the intakes of the VTOL turbofans as -- 
HIS LEONOPTERYX BANKS in a tight arc back toward him and -- 
HE SPRINTS ON as the grenades EXPLODE, shattering the turbines, which riddle the fuselage with shrapnel and -- 
JAKE LEAPS INTO SPACE, landing on the back of his mount and reconnecting. They flap away, gaining altitude as fire BLASTS out of the bottom of the shuttle. 
ON THE FLIGHT DECK, the pilot feels the ship dropping. 
PILOT Mains to a hundred percent!   Get me airspeed! 
The pilot and copilot slam the throttle levers forward and -- 
The FUSION ENGINES BLAZE, thrusting the shuttle forward.    It still falls, its remaining lift fans screaming, until -- 
IT'S CLIPPING the tree tops when it gets enough translational lift to fly and -- 
THE PILOT PULLS back on the stick, lifting the nose. 
PILOT We're good! 
BEHIND HIM, a surviving Na'vi hunter runs forward and -- 
THOONK!   ARROWHEADS sprout from the pilots' necks and chests.

Alien III Screenplay by John Fasano Story by Vincent Ward & John Fasano 
FIRST DRAFT March 29, 1990 
"But how will you die when your time comes, Narcissus, since you have no mother?  Without a mother, one cannot love.  Without a mother, one cannot die." 
- Hesse 
ALIEN III 
THE SCREEN IS BLACK 
A pinpoint of light appears. Red.  An ember. Unseen BELLOWS blow. 
GLASS FURNACE 
The embers glow.  Flame. The fire GROWS. 
A RIVER OF MOLTEN GLASS 
Heated by the furnace to over 1,300 degrees fahrenheit. White Hot. 
GLASS FACTORY 
Flickering flame casts dancing shadows on wooden walls. Coarsely grained wood.  Moisture blasted out by years of intense heat.  Timbers split.  Patched with new wood, it too now old and dry. 
SMOKE 
Billows up the walls. Hangs as an angry, black cloud amongst the rafters and beams of the vaulted ceiling.  Almost obscures -- 
A MAN 
On a narrow LEDGE, twenty feet about the Glassworks' floor. His clothing is Medieval.  A rough textured cassock. He is a MONK. 
LOUVERS are set into the wall.  He angles them open. The smoke begins to escape. 
The Monk turns, raises arms and LEAPS from his lofty perch -- Gently gliding down to the floor with the aid of a FLOWING FOX -- a primitive hand-held pulley that runs down a rope. He lands next to the glass furnace, surrounded by -- 
MORE MONKS 
By their dress.  With Blowing Iron and Pontil. They blow and shape the molten glass.  Crack off the finished pieces.  The old way. 
ONE PARTICULAR MONK 
Black skinned, early fifties. Stirs his five foot long blowing iron in the molten glass, but he is watching something else.  It moves him to song. Lilting tenor lifts high into the air. This is BROTHER KYLE. 
BROTHER KYLE Well would he guess the ascending of the star, Wherein his patient's fortunes settled were. He knew the course of every malady, Were it of cold or heat or moist or dry. Brother John, would-be Doctour of Physick. 
We see the object of his song: 
BROTHER JOHN 
Not yet forty.  Strong features, but fear behind the eyes. The fear that comes from a lack of inner confidence. A good face, nonetheless. He stirs a thick mixture in a mortar. Next to him another MONK sits holding his arm out in front of him, cassock sleeve rolled up, revealing a vicious BURN. 
BROTHER KYLE Tend you quickly he will, with bottles from a shelf. But heals not, so easily, The ills which plague himself. 
Brother John stops stirring. 
BROTHER JOHN (to Kyle) Enough. 
He scoops the salve out with his fingers and applies it to the Burned Monk's arm.  The Burned Monk INHALES sharpley as the cool mixture contacts the injured area. 
BROTHER JOHN (to the burned Monk) Relax. (to Kyle) Put those lungs of yours to better use. 
BROTHER KYLE Yes, Doc Tor. 
Kyle laughs, removes the blowing iron from the molten glass -- a BLOB of white hot glass hanging on the end. 
He rolls the blob on the Marver, a flat, polished piece of iron, then begins to blow a bottle shaped container. 
John wraps a fray-edged cloth bandage around the burn. 
JOHN Keep this from getting wet.  Go home at late afternoon mealtime and don't come back to work today -- 
BURNED MONK But John -- 
JOHN I'll tell the Abbot.  Just rest today. You're lucky you only burned yourself on the side of the furnace.  If some of that glass had gotten on your arm -- 
He points to the top of his forearm. 
JOHN 
Rows right into it. His coracle pitches in the choppy surf. He scrambles onto the ship's cracked tile surface. Teeters -- balances -- moves to the unmistakeable HATCH. Looks around for a knob, a handle -- 
NEXT TO THE HATCH 
A small panel door whose black and yellow stripes denote urgency.  John hesitantly opens the door, revealing a shiny metal LEVER.  He stares at it...a beat. Then quickly pulls it down... WUORRRSH -! Hull door OPENS. 
The doorway is a black maw. John crosses himself. Begins to lower his foot into the hatch -- 
KYLE O/S Watch it! 
He almost falls backwards off the ship.  Looks back -- 
THE OTHER MONKS 
Are rapidly approaching. Kyle gestulates wildly -- 
KYLE John!  Wait -- !  Don't go in! 
John turns back to the open hatch. Machine recirculated air flows out. He feels it on the skin of his face.  Cool. Cool, and artificial.  It calls to him. He steps in.  Swallowed by the blackness -- 
WHOOSH-CLANG -! The door closes behind him. 
INT. SULACO ESCAPE POD #4 - DAY 
Dark.  Dim red lights.  John stands still as his eyes adjust to the darkness.  He sees: 
NEWT'S HYPER SLEEP TUBE 
A glass and metal COFFIN -- pneumatic piping twines around its base.  The glass lid is BROKEN.  A Small RED LIGHT pulses at the head of the tube -- a soft VOICE and TONE, like your seat belt warning -- is audible... 
COMPUTER VOICE (sotto) Seal broken...seal broken... 
John finds himself moving towards the tube... Looks through the broken lid: 
IN THE TUBE 
There is a splattered BLOOD STAIN on the sterile white interior.  OLD, turned rust-brown. Whatever happened here happened a while ago. Rust colored drips trail down to -- 
THE FLOOR 
Drag marks.  His eyes follow the stains to a pile of Bloody clothing against a control panel.  A jumpsuit.  Torn. Child size.  The head of child's DOLL, but no body to be found. 
JOHN 
Looks back towards the door. Part of him wants to get the hell out here -- but he fights back his fear.  He is a doctor - or trying to be - someone in here may need his help.  He presses forward -- Averts his gaze from the clothing, UP to the blinking and glowing instrument panels and their myraid -- 
LIGHTS 
Pressure lights.  Data lights.  Warning lights. Thousands of lights.  Like the stars in the sky. 
It's been decades since he's seen technology like this -- and never this close up.  He steps further into the ship, his fear now replaced by fascination, follows the lights.... 
ON A PALE GREEN SCREEN 
LED numbers race -- 7,291.01.05...06...07 A legand identifies "Elapsed since separation." He moves on... 
A VIDEO MONITOR 
Through scanning bars of snow, an image: A WOMAN with a YOUNG GIRL standing in front of her. The Woman's arms are wrapped around the girl. Protective. Maternal. 
The Woman speaks.  Her message repeats itself. A tape loop, although John has no idea what that is. 
WOMAN ...taking pod four.  The Crew of the SS Sulaco and all Marine commandoes are dead. Ship's sensors have interrupted the hyper sleep cycle.  An overlooked alien egg has hatched.  Bishop and Hicks have been killed. Xenomorphs have infested the cruiser.  Newt and I are taking pod four.  The Crew of... 
The WARNING TONE of the Woman's message rekindles John's fear. He moves more hesitantly around the periphery of the ship, following the trail of blinking instruments -- Drawn to touch a button.  Click... 
SOMETHING TENTACLE-LIKE DROPS DOWN ON HIS SHOULDER! Just an oxygen mask. 
John feels his rapidly BEATING heart as he pushes aside the plastic, dangling object and continues around the shuttle. His hand brushes over a SENSOR which responds by lighting and -- 
HSSSSSSSSS -! A BLAST of freon shoots out of an overhead pipe -- John SHOUTS and back up into -- 
ANOTHER HYPER SLEEP TUBE!!! 
Next to Newt's now empty tube. Humming gently.  Still operational. John approaches it cautiously. He can make out the occupant through the lid... 
A WOMAN 
He smiles at her. Friendly, not sexual. 
RIPLEY 
Shakes her head.  Tries to speak -- Her lips form soundless words. She looks over her other shoulder, sees -- 
THE SHIP - RIPLEY POV 
Bobbing on the surface. Growing small with each stroke of the oars. 
RIPLEY 
Brows knit.  Fights the cobwebs in her brain. Tries to focus on the ship -- Remembers. Turns to John, tries to speak -- 
RIPLEY Wait.  New... 
She loses consciousness. 
GO TO BLACK... 
INT. THE ABBEY - RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY 
Streaks of light move across the darkness. Form patterns of light and shadow against the wooden walls. There is a sublime stillness, but coming through the walls are the muted, far off SOUNDS of the Abbey -- The SAWING of wood.  HAMMERING. WHISPERED prayers. LILTING song. 
We move down off the wall to a hand-made wooden bed. Ripley in restless sleep. 
EXT. ARCEON SEA - DUSK 
The waters grown rough with the approach of night.  Wind whips across white wave tops -- SPRAYS the dozen Monks who LASH their boats to Ripley's SHIP with thick hemp ropes -- Start to tow it to shore... 
INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Ripley is sleeping -- but struggling against some unseen foe -- She tries to sit up -- can't.  Tries to shake off the effects of the suspended animation...looks up through half-lidded eyes: 
JOHN 
Sits next to her.  Quite asleep. Hands swathed in white bandages.  Book resting on his lap. 
She squints to make the figure standing in the shadows behind him -- it's skin picks up and reflects tiny points of flickering cangle light - seems to ripple as it moves -- 
THE ALIEN 
Big, black shiny-smooth head moves into the taper light. It moves towards her, cable-like arms held out at its side -- moving out of sync with its feet -- Ripley tries to move - to cry out -- She can't. 
She can only move her eyes.  She looks over at John, sleeping peacefully.  He doesn't notice the Alien -- 
The Alien moves closer. She can feel his breath -- it evaporates the sweat  on her forehead -- a CHILL runs through her but she still can't move -- 
The Alien stands alongside her bed. Extends a six-fingered hand... Gently rests it on her stomach. Cocks its head -- like it's listening to something. The implication is clear. 
Ripley finds her voice -- 
RIPLEY AAAAAAAAAAAARGH! 
Her eyes open wide -- She sits bolt upright. 
A hand moves to her forehead.  Gently pushes her head back to the pillow.  John's. 
JOHN You're out of it.  Out of it... 
Ripley falls back, eyes glued to where the alien appeared. John sees her focal point, looks back over his shoulder: Nothing. Ripley's eyes roll back into her head. She tries to speak -- It was there. Her hand, at her side, tightens into a fist -- 
John's hand covers hers. Eases the fingers open again. She feels the coarse bandages against her palm. 
He starts to read quietly from Saint Augustines' Confessions. She begins to drowse again as his soft voice flows over her like waves lapping against the shore... 
EXT. SURGACE OF ARCEON - DAY 
A HOWLING DUST STORM has kicked up.  The monks wear small round goggles, have rags tied over their noses, as they work at a huge BLOCK AND TACKLE arrangement -- 
Hundreds of ropes grow TAUT. Timbers GROAN. They LIFT Ripley's SHIP -- SWING it over to a large portal -- 
INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY 
Ripley lays with eyes closed. Muffled VOICES outside her door: 
ABBOT How is the woman, John? 
JOHN I don't think she's here yet. 
RIPLEY (calculates) Loose for two days.  This planet could be overrun within the week. 
Ripley grabs the Abbot by his cassock -- 
RIPLEY Look, there's a xenomorph -- (sees his confusion) An Alien creature.  A killer.  A monster. And now it's here. 
The Abbot looks at her the way you look at that guy on the corner of Santa Monica and 3rd who's babbling about Judgement Day.  The guy with his pants down around his kness. 
She sees this, releases her hold on him... RIPLEY Calm down, Ripley.  Okay, I was with a platoon of Colonial Marines on a mission to planetoid LV426.  We left Earth six months ago - maybe a year -- 
ABBOT (interrupts) Wait a moment -- 
The Abbot becomes aware of John's presence in the doorway. Turns over his shoulder at him. 
ABBOT Leave us. 
John waits there a beat, then backs out and closes the door. 
ABBOT Continue. 
RIPLEY We launched in the Cruiser Sulaco from Gateway sub-orbital space station -- 
ABBOT Not possible. 
RIPLEY What do you mean? 
ABBOT When we left Earth seventy years ago, it was on the brink of a New Dark Age. Technology was on the verge of destroying the planet's environment.  A computer virus was threatening to wipe away all recorded knowledge.  There didn't seem to be any way it could be averted.  In the almost forty years since we were towed out here in hypersleep, the news that came with occasional supply ships only got worse. Finally, the ships stopped coming.  We had to resign ourselves to the fact that worst had come to pass, and the Earth no longer existed. 
Now she gives him that look. RIPLEY (slowly) Uh...All right... Forget the Earth - How many people do you have here?  Let's worry about them.  Warn them -- 
A new look overtakes the Abbot's face.  A look of fear. Now she's getting to him - or is she? He abruptly stands. 
ABBOT Your mind is troubled.  You need to rest some more. 
RIPLEY I don't need rest - I need to get to your people.  You've got to get to them -- tell them about the alien -- 
He heads for the door -- 
ABBOT I have had enough for now. 
RIPLEY Enough?  Didn't you hear what I said? It could wipe out the entire population of this planet.  It may have started already - Have there been any unusual deaths since I got here? 
The Abbot stops in the door - 
ABBOT No.  And there won't be. 
The Abbot SLAMS the door behind him. 
THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY 
John stands nearby as the Abbot addresses two BURLY MONKS 
ABBOT Bolt it. 
The guards move to bolt the door. 
JOHN What is it -- What's wrong? 
ABBOT Your patient is in a dangerous mental state.  Nobody gets in or out until I say so. 
JOHN But I.  Her meals -- 
ABBOT Nobody. 
JOHN Father, I don't understand -- 
The Abbot turns and disappears down the hall. John looks from the departing Abbot to the two Guard/Monks. 
THE LIBRARY - NIGHT 
John has his head buried in his hands.  His back rises and falls with the rhythmic breathing of sleep. Mattias curled up on his feet.  Asleep as well. WHAM! The Library door FLIES open --! John sits bolt upright -- 
A HYSTERICAL MONK bursts in. Rushes to John's table. 
HYSTERICAL MONK Brother John!  You're here!  The Abbot said you'd -- I need -- you're the medic -- 
JOHN What?! 
HYSTERICAL MONK My Sandy -- she's ill -- 
It TWISTS at the end of the fork, acid blood dripping onto the wood floor -- each drop bursting into a little pool of FIRE. 
The Hysterical Monk turns to the now raging hay fire -- The entire corner of the barn is ablaze -- SHOVES the abomination in -- 
The Sheep/Alien POPS and SIZZLES as tongues of flame leap up to lap at it's struggling body -- tiny tail whipping about -- 
The creature dies, its fading screams are soon the only sound heard within the barn.  The Hysterical Monk holds his fork in the flame as he looks back to check on -- 
JOHN 
Face contorted, eyes glued to the burning creature.  Heaving lungs push air through his diaphram, but no sound comes from his open mouth -- The Doctor in training has seen the devil. 
EXT. HYSTERICAL MONK'S BARN - NIGHT 
Wooden walls collapse inward as the building becomes a pyre. Acrid black smoke curls up to the ceiling and spreads out across the rafters... 
We pull back from the sight INTO a window. Into 
INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Ripley, watches the burning barn.  Frustrated, she climbs out of the bed on unsteady legs, wearing her tank top and shorts. Pulls on a coarse wollen cassock, ties the rope belt -- 
RIPLEY Idiots...I'll -- 
WHAM! The door BURSTS OPEN -- 
RIPLEY What the -? 
Four BURLY MONKS rush in and grab her. TEAR her out of bed -- 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Ripley is dragged down the darkened hallway. 
ABBOT V.O. An evil has come to Arceon... 
IN THE TRIBUNAL ROOM - NIGHT 
As he continues we move down a row of stern Monk faces, ending at the Abbots... 
ABBOT You heard Brother Graham tell of the devil inside sheep's wool -- 
He motions towards the Hysterical Monk, sitting in the crowd. 
ABBOT An evil brought by this woman in her vessel of technology. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
A large circular room with wooden walls stretching thirty feet high.  Light creeps in through stained glass windows. 
Hundreds of monks sits in a gallery that looms over the floor of the Tribunal.  On the floor: 
The Abbot and the five eldest Monks sit at a long table facing the witness stand.  On the stand: 
RIPLEY 
Considers the faces that surround her.  Fear.  Hate. 
RIPLEY This can't be happening. 
BALD TRIBUNAL MONK You have no voice in this tribunal. 
RIPLEY You must listen to me!  You're all in terrible danger!  It came with me on the ship -- 
ABBOT We know that.  At first we believed its arrival was a good omen.  But it has only brought pestilence.  Dead sheep.  Dead fish. 
BALD TRIBUNAL MONK Evil. 
Ripley turns to the Abbot. 
RIPLEY Yes, the ship brought it.  Not evil. It brought the Alien.  I told you, it's here. 
ABBOT We know the name of the evil it brought. It brought technology.  Technology to destroy our planet, as surely as it destroyed the Earth. 
MONK IN AUDIENCE Destruction! 
RIPLEY I was on the Earth less than a year ago. It's still there.  People, cities, all still there! 
A murmur through the crowd.  Some are listening to her. The Abbot looks around.  He must be in command. 
JOHN Please, sir, let me finish.  I feel that there may be something to what she says. 
ABBOT There isn't. 
The Abbot moves to his table, begins to gather up his gavel, notebook.  John follows him -- 
JOHN I don't understand what you are doing. 
ABBOT This colony is my responsibility.  I am protecting the colony. 
JOHN From what?  This woman?  You never gave her a chance.  How can you be so sure you're right? 
ABBOT A better question is what makes you think I'm wrong? 
JOHN You didn't see this thing -- this demon -- Brother Graham and I -- we both saw it. 
ABBOT (realizes) That's right.  You both did. (beat) And what was it? 
JOHN I -- I don't know what it was.  But I don't think Ripley was a party to it. 
ABBOT She admits she brought it. 
JOHN But she tried to warn us -- 
ABBOT You know that's how the devil works. Deception. 
JOHN But I believe her.  I don't know how to describe it -- A feeling. 
ABBOT You haven't seen a woman in thirty years. Where does this feeling originate, John? 
JOHN (points to his head) Here. 
Pause. 
ABBOT I believe you.  But your feelings are fooling you. 
JOHN It's - It's her conviction.  I just think -- 
The Abbot snaps at him -- 
ABBOT Don't think. 
John takes a step back at the Abbot's tone.  A tone he's never heard before.  The Abbot runs a hand through his thinning hair. Forces a smile. 
ABBOT It's been a long night.  For all of us. You really don't understand what you're dealing with here. 
JOHN That's what she said. 
The Abbot chafes. 
ABBOT These are ideas which threaten the very system we live under.  The creature is dead and the woman is gone.  Forget them. Both.  Go read.  Go fishing.  Go anywhere, but leave this alone. 
JOHN But I -- 
ABBOT Alone.  I'll get Philip to let Mattias into the Library, all right?  For your own good, just stay out of this. 
John looks like he's going to protest. 
ABBOT I mean it. 
JOHN (slowly) Yes, Father. 
John turns and leaves the room. The Abbot stares after him. 
INT. PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT 
Dark. Dank. Dreary. A NAIL is hammered into a board.  Then another. The board is old, twisted.  The grain is pronounced, splintered. 
Another board is lifted into place, a nail held -- BAM-BAM-BAM - HAMMERED in tight. 
TWO ANCIENT WORKERS 
Drab, torn gray clothing. Hammer the boards over the opening in the wall. Methodically covering up -- 
RIPLEY 
Watching them work. BAM-BAM-BAM. Defeated. 
ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY (INTERCUT) 
The first golden rays of daylight filter through the huge stained glass windows.  John rapidly flips through the Medieval tome in front of him - past an illustration of Satan depicted as having a FACE on his ASS -- further still -- then stops. This is it. 
We can't see what the illustration is, but we see his REACTION: 
His eyes open wide as saucers.  SLAMS the book closed as if the image would strike blind.  He turns to Mattias as if to say something -- Decides not to wake the sleeping dog. 
John wraps the book's chain around his hand and puts one foot up against the shelf.  Pulls -- SPANKT! The old chain gives way. 
Face set, he loops the shoulder strap of his burlap medical bag over his shoulder.  Clutches the book to his chest, gently pets his sleeping dog and goes... 
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ABBOT'S OFFICE - DAY 
John strides down the corridor purposefully but stops and flattens himself against the wall when the door to the Abbot's office opens suddenly -- 
BROTHER GRAHAM, The Hysterical Monk, is forcibly led from the room by two burly Monks, taken down the corridor in the other direction.  He is gagged.  A third Burly Monk moves out of the doorway with the Abbot. 
JOHN Now find John and have him brought to me immediately. 
THIRD BURLY MONK Yes, Father. 
ABBOT Start in the library.  And keep it quiet. 
The Third Burly Monk nods and moves off. The Abbot watches him leave, then goes back into the room and closes the door.  John stares at the closed door a beat and then makes up his mind.  He turns and runs back down the hallway... 
INT. GLASS FACTORY - DAY 
The first Monks straggle in for the morning shift. Kyle is among them.  He lifts his blowing iron from a wall mounted rack and moves towards the glass furnace as two other Monks begin to stoke the fire. 
John enters. Looks around the room and for a frantic moment cannot find -- 
KYLE 
At the glass furnace.  About to dip his blowing iron into the MOLTEN GLASS.  John runs over to him. Almost knocks him over -- 
KYLE Hey!  Watch it! 
He sees that John is agitated -- 
KYLE What?  What is it? 
The other monks begin to notice the commotion, start moving in for a look... 
JOHN I -- Abbot.  Must -- 
John tries to catch his breath.  He gestulates wildly. Kyle puts down his blowing iron. 
KYLE John - relax.  Take a deep breath - Christ, now I sound like you -- 
He sees the book clutched in John's white knuckled hands. 
KYLE Is that it, John?  Is it the book --? 
JOHN (panting) Yes.  Devil. 
Kyle moves closer to him.  Cautiously. John sees the other monks gathering around -- Closing in on him - whispering -- 
WHISPERING MONKS He's got it... 
SECOND WHISPERING MONK Like the Comet Woman... 
THIRD WHISPERING MONK He found her... WHISPERING MONK He's infected... 
John sees one of the Monks run out -- undoubtedly going to tell the Abbot.  John looks into his friend Kyle's face -- Fear. 
KYLE Everything's gonna be fine.  Now, let's see the -- 
JOHN Don't humor me -- I'm -- KYLE Sure.  Everything's gonna be fine... 
If only he could explain - he can't. John YANKS the book away -- spins -- Bursts through the crowd... 
KYLE Wait -- JOHN! 
INT. SHAFT ROOM - DAY 
The cage is still down, the ropes stretching into the abyss. John runs in.  Moves to the ropes.  Places the book on the floor. Tightens his scarred hands on the rope -- Mind racing: The woman will know.  Know what it is.  How to combat it. He PULLS -- 
There's no tension against the ropes. John FALLS back on his ass. 
The ropes WHIZ through the rusty pulley overhead. Pile on the floor in front of John. He lifts the end of the rope.  Stares: BITTEN THROUGH. 
RIPLEY Wherever I go. 
A HAND pushes a crust of bread through the hole. She opens her eyes to look at the food.  The White-Haired Man's head appears -- 
WHITE-HAIRED MAN Take it. 
RIPLEY Thanks, but no thanks, Anthony. 
She knows his name. 
ANTHONY You waiting for meat?  They don't bring me meat because they know I'm an android. Really don't need it.  Bread's better for you anyway.  Harder to digest, so it makes you feel fuller than you are. 
RIPLEY Not hungry. 
Anthony takes a bite. 
ANTHONY Mmmm.  Just a little crunchy. 
Ripley twists onto her back until she's staring up at the ceiling. 
RIPLEY Waste of time. 
ANTHONY You don't eat, you'll starve to death, girl. 
RIPLEY That was the plan when they put me down here.  And why should you care? 
ANTHONY Because I'm a synthetic person you don't think I can care? 
RIPLEY Believe me, that's a discussion you don't want to have with me. 
ANTHONY You told me you had a bad experience and a good one with androids -- 
RIPLEY That's one of each.  That means you could go either way.  I'm tired of talking about this. 
He pushes the bread towards her again. 
ANTHONY You've still gotta eat.  You gotta fight the bastards -- 
RIPLEY I'm tired of fighting.  Maybe I'll be dead before he finds me.  Maybe he won't get the satisfaction. 
ANTHONY He?  You make it sound like this Alien has a personal score to settle with you. The biology you describe:  Queen laying eggs, larvae, drone -- that's very insectoid.  Insects usually don't bear grudges. 
RIPLEY And Androids usually aren't the prisoners of lunatics that believe they're ancient Greeks. 
ANTHONY Medieval Monks. 
RIPLEY Whatever. 
ANTHONY And they've only chose to live the life style, they don't believe they're -- (hears something) What's that? 
Ripley strains to listen.  In the distance: KNOCKING.  Someone is knocking on the walls. A VOICE calls out -- 
INT. PRISON LEVEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
JOHN (hoarse) Ripley! 
He moves down the hallway. BANGS his fist against the walls every few feet -- Waits a moment for a reply, then moves on. 
INT. ANTHONY'S CELL 
Anthony gets off the floor - Moves so she can see into his cell: 
The walls of Anthony's cell are covered with charcoal sketches - Different versions of demons and the devil.  She rolls her eyes - This guy is an Android! 
Anthony crosses to his cell door, peers through eye level. 
INT. PRISON LEVEL CORRIDOR HALLWAY - ANTHONY POV 
John coming towards him, knocking on the doors of boarded up cells. 
ANTHONY Hey -- you knocking -- cut it out -- You're going to wake everybody up. 
John moves to Anthony's door.  Looks at him through the slot. Anthony recognizes him. 
ANTHONY Brother John? 
John unbolts Anthony's door. Picks him up by his cassock -- 
JOHN Anthony?  Thought you dead fifteen years. 
RIPLEY Well, you start appreciating him more than me and I'll find a way to shut you down, capisce, Andy?  How do we get up? 
JOHN There are ladders. 
She stops.  John and Anthony continue on a few steps and then stop and walk back to her. 
RIPLEY Five miles with the Alien between us and there?  Good luck, boys. 
She turns and heads back towards her cell -- John catches her shoulder -- 
JOHN You can't -- 
RIPLEY Can't what?  Not help you go to your deaths?  I've had my fill of that. 
JOHN I need you.  I can't do it alone. 
RIPLEY I've fought these creatures twice before.  It take a lot to kill these things.  Heavy artillery. 
ANTHONY We don't have weapons here. 
RIPLEY How about something we can make weapons from?  Do you have anything like that -- any modern things here? 
John SHAKES his head vehemently -- 
JOHN We renounced technology.  It was those things that caused the Plague. 
RIPLEY This is a man-made planet.  Something has to be recirculating your air, your water. 
JOHN God? 
RIPLEY Please. 
JOHN I don't know.  I just took it for granted. 
RIPLEY Most people do.  Without some sort of technology we haven't got a chance. 
From behind them: 
ANTHONY There is technology. 
John and Ripley turn to look at him. 
ANTHONY A room.  A Technology room.  Fresh air and water come out. 
RIPLEY An atmosphere processing plant -- 
ANTHONY The heart and lungs of Arceon. 
RIPLEY Where is it? 
ANTHONY One level beneath the underground sea. 
JOHN That's five levels up -- 
ANTHONY (points into the gloom) On the other side of the orbiter. 
John looks at Ripley -- 
JOHN A chance. 
Ripley looks from John's earnest face to the darkness and back. 
RIPLEY All right.  You've got me - so far. But here's the deal:  I don't know how many of your brethren are going to be alive when we get up there, but if we make it to my ship, you're all coming with me.  We'll take as many of your precious books as we can carry, but we're going.  I'm not going to fight this thing again to end up alone again.  Understand? 
John nods his head. 
RIPLEY We're all dead anyway.  We might as well go fi -- 
She feels a TWINGE in her midsection -- Doubles over.  Anthony and John each take an arm -- 
RIPLEY Ugh - I'm all right. 
She takes a deep breath. 
RIPLEY Still thawing out.  I hate hyper sleep... Come on. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ARCEON - MONASTERY LEVEL - NIGHT 
RIPLEY I got a belly full of that from the Psychtechs when I was on Earth.  Yeah. "Survivor Guilt syndrome," or something like that.  But that's not what I was thinking about.  I was thinking about my "friend" up there. 
She looks up. 
RIPLEY He was on the pod.  He killed Newt but not me.  Why not me?  It's almost like he's playing with me.  Maybe they have some sort of race memory.  Maybe he knows what I did to his "mother." That's why he didn't just kill me. That would be too easy.  He has to torment me. 
JOHN You make it sound human. 
RIPLEY Hell, I don't know what it is. 
John unconsiously fingers his book. 
JOHN I think I do. 
INT. LADDER-WELL - PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT 
At the end of the space a rough hewn wooden ladder leads to another block of cell corridors four stories up. Years of damp air have warped the ladder. Ripley leads the way, torch in her left hand. They climb... 
INT. END OF PRISON CORRIDOR - FOURTH LEVEL - NIGHT 
Dark.  Ripley is the first one up. She raises her torch and heads down the new corridor alone. The cells here have no doors. She holds her torch in one -- An old skeleton sits in quiet contemplation. 
AT THE LADDER 
John is just climbing off, Anthony right behind him. Anthony is winded.  He reaches up for a helping hand. John looks back and sees that Ripley has moved ahead without them, then reaches down to help Anthony. Their hands clasp -- 
ANTHONY HAS A "VISION" 
He is seemingly standing in an open field, sheep grazing peacefully at his side. SUDDENLY he is ATTACKED by a horde of Medieval demons. 
Fish faced demons.  Man-headed bird demons. They fly about him, grab hold of his limbs. The Sheep nearest him opens it's mouth to reveal a horde of razor sharp fangs, SINKS THEM INTO HIS ANKLE -- 
Anthony SCREAMS -! 
RIPLEY 
Down the corridor HEARS the scream, turns back -- sees Anthony fighting with himself, struggling against John's grasp - 
ANTHONY 
Balanced precariously on the top of the ladder in the real world as he fights against the demons in his android mind -- He JERKS -- Pulls his left ankle out of the grasp of the DEMON SHEEP -- OFF the ladder - forty foot drop waiting below him... 
JOHN 
Struggles to keep his death grip on Anthony's hand. It's all that keeps Anthony from falling back down the shaft -- 
JOHN Jesus Christ.  Ripleeeee -! 
He PULLS with all his might... 
ANTHONY 
SEES a horrible BIRD-DEMON grasping his hand in its beak -- BITING through his wrist.  He waves his staff in the air -- He aims for its head: CRACK -! WHACKS John's hand with his staff -- 
John HOWLS in pain - LETS GO -- 
Anthony TEETERS BACK ON ONE FOOT, arms waving in the air -- 
Ripley's hands SHOOT OUT -- GRAB Anthony's cassock -- STOP his fall. 
Anthony's eyes open wide at the sight of this new horror -- A terrible, wet, black cable-armed CREATURE that's latched itself onto his cassock -- Long, shiny head. Ripley has become the Alien. 
WHACK! Anthony HITS the Creature with his staff -- HITS Ripley on the head. WHACK! Again.  In the face. 
John tries to take hold of Anthony's staff arm -- WHACK! The cane WHIPS against the side of his head, knocking him back. Ripley sets her feet and pulls on Anthony's cassock -- Opens her mouth - GRUNTS -- 
ANTHONY sees the terrible Alien open it's maw to devour him. 
WHACK! His staff connects with the bridge of Ripley's nose. She sees flashes of light -- loses her balance -- Pitches forward, starts to go over with Anthony -- 
JOHN GRABS THEM! 
Wraps his arms around the struggling pair and like a sumo wrestler LIFTS and FALLS backwards - carrying the three of them into the corridor -- WHUMPH! 
They land on the floor in a heap. Anthony continues to FLAIL ABOUT -- 
Ripley and John pin him to the floor between them. Finally, the vision leaves him. He loses consciousness. 
JOHN 
RIPLEY I've faced this evil twice before - I guess I've gotten sensitive to it -- (beat) You're really a Doctor? 
John pats his canvas bag. 
JOHN See my bag? 
RIPLEY What's that book? 
JOHN Just a book. 
RIPLEY I don't buy "just a book" from a guy who says we can't leave the planet without the library. JOHN It's just... a medical book I might need. 
RIPLEY You don't have any food in there, do you? 
JOHN Only if you can eat bandages. 
Ripley rubs her midsection. 
RIPLEY In a few hours that's going to sound good.  Going in and out of suspended animation - Christ I probably haven't eaten in a year. 
ANTHONY (without opening eyes) You should've eaten the bread. 
RIPLEY AND JOHN Rest! 
Ripley lets her head loll back against the wall. Closes her eyes.  Time passes. Her brow knits. John sees this. 
JOHN You all right? 
RIPLEY Aces. 
JOHN You weren't hurt when I landed on you? Bruised a rib? 
He reaches over and puts his hands beneath her cassock. Feels her midsection.  His hands are warm. 
RIPLEY Are you sure you're a doctor? 
He withdraws his hands. 
JOHN Sort of.  My father passed on when we first came here.  The Abbey's Physician - Father Anselm - took me in.  He really raised me -- (pause) Taught me what he could before he passed away.  He was schooled on Earth. 
RIPLEY Well, I'm just hungry. 
JOHN You haven't eaten since I took you out of your tube. 
RIPLEY You did that... 
She reaches out and takes hold of his hands.  Turns them over. 
RIPLEY You burned yourself on the escape pod. 
Her hands on his makes him feel...uncomfortable. 
RIPLEY Thank you, I guess. 
They look into each other's eyes -- 
ANTHONY O/S You should've eaten the bread. 
Ripley, embarrassed, releases his hands. Looks at Anthony.  He's trying to stand. 
ANTHONY Enough rest.  There's beasties afoot. 
They start into... 
A NARROW CORRIDOR 
Ceiling so low their torches must be held out in front of them. Ripley makes an effort not to move faster than the two monks. 
INT. LADDER SHAFT 
A great long ladder hanging in the middle of nowhere. Seems at least a mile long. The group climbs... 
A SERPENTINE CORRIDOR 
Liquid drips through the ceiling planks over head. Falls into RED puddles on the slanted floor. 
John kneels, dips his fingertips -- 
JOHN Blood. (sniffs) Mixed with sea water. 
ANTHONY 
Bringing up the rear, puts his walking stick down -- SNAPP!!! Everybody stops at the sound. 
ABBOT What was that? 
Anthony pulls his stick from the grasp of a-- 
ANTHONY Man trap. 
They lower their candles.  Look to: 
THE FLOOR 
Interspersed throughout the timbers -- Spring jawed, steel toothed, BEAR TRAPS. Rusted.  Open.  And all around them. 
ANTHONY In case anyone tried to get in and tamper with the technology. 
The four of them are standing in the middle of a mine-field of man traps.  Nobody moves. 
ABBOT What do we do? 
RIPLEY Don't move.  Don't breath. 
ABBOT We can't just stand here and wait. 
RIPLEY Floor's too unstable to try to walk around them. 
John pulls a loose board from the corridor wall. Turns and kneels at the trap in front of him. Pokes the end of the board into the jaws... SNAP!! 
The others jump at the sound -- 
ABBOT John - what are you doing? 
John pulls the stick out of the rusted jaws. Moves to the next trap -- Snap!! 
RIPLEY He's thinking like a leader.  Everyone: Grab wood.  Spring the traps.  Clear a path. (proud of him) Good work, Father John. 
JOHN Brother. 
RIPLEY Brother.  Let's go. 
Ripley pulls a plank from the wall next to her. Exposes a bit of the surface underneath -- It's METAL. 
She touches the cool, familiar material.  Smiles. Now she knows this is not a dream. She turns and SPRINGS the trap in front of her -- SNAP!! 
THE FOUR 
Slowly make their way down the corridor, one hand holding a candle high, the other poking a piece of wood into the trap in front of them... SNAP-SNAP...SNAP. SNAP. walking carefully around the yet unfired traps.... 
THE DOOR TO THE TECHNOLOGY ROOM 
A huge wooden door with no knob or handle.  Looks like it could almost be part of the wall.  John and Ripley are the first to it.  They put down their planks and begin to feel around the edges of the door for some purchase. The Abbot joins them. 
BACK IN THE CORRIDOR 
Anthony lags behind.  He senses a presence in the hallway. Hears a sound behind him. We see a GLIMPSE of something -- He turns towards the sound -- 
Empty hallway. 
He thinks.  Starts forward again -- with his ear cocked to the rear... SNAP! 
AT THE DOOR 
Ripley, John and The Abbot knock on the door, walls. Ripley leans her head against the wall in frustration and exhaustion.  To get this far, and be locked out. She feels sick to her stomach. How long since she had food? She looks over at John. He is staring at her. He turns red at being caught.  Cute. 
JOHN I just - are you allright? 
RIPLEY Tied.  Without sleep, food -- I just feel my age. (smiles) Figuring hyperspace time, I'm almost a hundred. 
She wipes her brow and goes back to knocking... 
JOHN Hello? 
The wall beneath his fist sounds hollow. Fingernails find the edge of the plank and pull -- The plank slides aside on tiny, rusty pneumatic pistons. 
BEHIND THE PLANK 
A primitive KEYBOARD.  Circa late twentieth century. 
ABBOT Maybe more than one of us. 
RIPLEY Let's talk about the facts, Mr. Abbot. 
She looks at the windmills. WHOOSH...WHOOSH... 
RIPLEY This is your technology? 
ABBOT Even this is forbidden to us. 
RIPLEY Well then, the facts are that we're screwed. 
She moves into the room.  Walks around one of the Windmills. 
RIPLEY An Eco system.  Nothing to recycle your atmosphere except the green plants.  Winds generated down here -- (looks at the floor) Windmills use the natural surface winds to turn wheels underground, create tides on the seas to recirculate your water... 
ANTHONY More than that.  There are pumps beneath the floor - I can feel their vibration. 
RIPLEY Probably pumping this air through charcoal filters. 
WHOOSH...WHOOSH... 
RIPLEY It gets colder all the time here, right? 
John looks at her questioningly. 
JOHN Yes... 
RIPLEY Your wood burning fires throw soot into the atmosphere, building the cloud layer - cutting off the sun's rays - cooling the planet, forcing you to burn more wood. 
WHOOSH...WHOOSH... 
ANTHONY The Greenhouse Effect.  It's how the Earth almost destroyed itself in the late 20th century. 
RIPLEY Don't you see?  This is a planet set to self destruct.  Not in ten minutes or two hours but soon.  Your atmosphere here is finite.  If the plants die the fires will eat up all the oxygen - this planetoid will be dead - Everyone will die. 
The Abbot has the look of a man who has been beaten in the last few meters of a Marathon. 
ABBOT It's here.  I was just hoping I would be dead long before it came to this. 
JOHN What? 
ABBOT We're supposed to die here.  That's the point. 
RIPLEY Wait a minute -- you were exiled --? 
ABBOT The punishment for our crime was death. 
Anthony sits up. 
ANTHONY This planet is the supreme triumph of planned obsolesence.  A certain amount of primitive materials with an atmosphere processing system as fragile as a real environment but not replenishable. 
The Abbot has a faraway look in his eyes... 
ABBOT Poetic justice for the anti-technologists. The Company's best work.  You know, I used to be a corporate executive.  Middle range V.P.  Then my wife got hit by a speed craft. I chucked it all and joined the order. Be a monk -- see the world.  Being here, being chairman of the board... 
RIPLEY No, now I understand why I landed here. To join you happy lunatics in your deaths. 
Ripley moves away... John starts after her. 
JOHN Ripley, wait -- 
The Abbot stands, blocks his way. 
ABBOT Where can she go?  She's trapped. (beat) Trapped inside her own prison.  A prison in her mind.  Inside her mind.  Dancing. Sparklets of light - dance with the june bugs in the recesses of ourmindstheyare coming to danceintheshadowof... 
John and Ripley turn to look at the Abbot. He begins to speak faster.  Faster. He shakes.  Vibrates is more accurate -- A trickle of BLOOD runs from his left ear... 
ABBOT RidingthewildwindsofchangeNoescapeNo escapeforthewickedEvilEvilthynameis woman.Woman.Womanheiscoming.Heiscoming foryouuuuuuuuu --* 
SPLORTCH-KT--!! The Abbot's HEAD EXPLODES --!!! Like a ripe melon dropped ten stories onto pavement. Blood, bone, hair and brain matter SPRAY John. John SCREAMS. 
A HORRIBLE ALIEN HEAD BURSTER 
Is all that sits atop the blood spurting neck of the Abbot. It keeps it's hold on the Abbot's spinal cord -- The Abbot's body continues to stagger around, arms jerking mechanically as lack of fresh nerve impulses from the brain works its way through the system. 
Ripley SCREAMS. The Infant Alien-headed corpse stumbles towards her -- She plucks Anthony's staff from the floor and SWINGS -- -- Like a child hitting a baseball from a TEE -- WHACK-K -!! BLASTS the Chest/head burster across the room -- 
It hits the floor SCRAMBLING.  Scuttles down into where the Windmills meet the floor.  Disappears. 
RIPLEY He could be waiting on the other side of that door.  We might not get ten feet before he kills the three of us. 
He shakes his head. 
JOHN We had better go, then. 
He smiles. She smiles back. They move up the ladder. 
It leads up a damp, short shaft, walls GREEN with algae, to 
AN UNDERGROUND DOCK - NIGHT 
The ladder shaft opens onto a barnacled pier.  Ripley and John climb out onto the wooden structure.  Before them: 
AN UNDERGROUND SEA stretches the width of the entire planet, over five miles across.  The floor of the lowest level of the top half of the orbiter makes a ceiling that looms a hundred feet overhead. 
The water sparkles with a golden glow. 
JOHN Must be day on the surface of the planet. 
RIPLEY Where is the light coming from? JOHN Mirrors.  Reflect the outside light down great shafts -- through lenses.  That's what they make in the glass factory. Lenses.  Look -- 
She turns: 
A HUGE WATERFALL 
Lit from within by daylight beaming down from above -- pours into the sea a short distance from them. 
JOHN Opens to the surface.  Water flows in and out.  I don't know how.  There's one at either end.  I came down on the other side. 
RIPLEY What do we do? 
John points to three small leather and wood coracles bobbing at the end of their ropes. 
JOHN We cross. 
INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - DAY 
Anthony has dragged himself to a sitting position against the bottom of one of the windmills.  He winces as he prods his tender ankle with the end of his staff.  It SPARKS. The large canvas arms of the windmill rotate above his head. The wind blows through his hair. WHOOSH...WHOOSH... Feels good. 
Anthony reaches up and waves his hand of his "eyes." 
ANTHONY Now the seer can only see what God wants him to.  Forty years on a planet of Monks and I've finally found religion. 
A floor board CREAKS. Anthony strains to hear: 
ANTHONY John?  Ripley? 
WHOOSH...WHOOSH... He knows it is not. 
ANTHONY Well come then.  I haven't got forever. 
A shadow falls across his face.  He can feel it. He doesn't have to see what is here. 
THE UNDERGROUND OCEAN - DAY INTO NIGHT 
The leather boat makes its way across the sea. John rows while Ripley holds the torch aloft. As night falls she takes the oars. 
The Ocean is dead calm.  The coracle glides across the glass- like surface.  John flexes his scarred fingers. 
RIPLEY Your hands okay? 
JOHN They'll be fine.  You've been on a boat before. 
Ripley squints ahead of them. The ocean seems to go on forever. 
RIPLEY I was a warrant officer on a ship -- but I did all my sailing in space. 
JOHN Father Anselm used to take me on his coracle when I was little. 
Ripley leans forward - scans his face. 
RIPLEY How old were you when they towed this satellite out here? 
JOHN Five.  The Abbot said they put us to sleep for the thirty years it took to get here.  We've had almost forty more.  Until now. 
RIPLEY What happened to your mother? 
JOHN Never had one.  I mean, never knew her. I mean, I did, once.  She left my father when he joined the movement.  If she hadn't I wouldn't be here.  They kept the other children with the women, on Earth.  That was too long ago now.  Like a dream. 
Climb through a hole where a trap door has been torn off it's hinges.  They look at the grim tableau: 
Monks impaled on their own pikes. Tangled together in their own pungy stakes. Alien cocoon material cobwebbed over their bodies. 
THE MONASTERY 
Flickering fires lit the first few floor windows. Ripley takes a step towards it -- Reaches back and pulls John... 
INT. GLASS FACTORY - NIGHT 
The Glass furnace boils almost to the point of overflow. Small fires burn out of control around the room. Finished glass pieces BURST from the heat. Ripley and John enter. 
JOHN This is the glassworks.  They have tools here -- (spots) Kyle -- 
He runs across the room -- 
BROTHER KYLE 
Sits calmly at the Marver table. He places playing cards on the table in front of him. Solitaire. He sings to himself quietly. 
KYLE (sotto) Can't see my baby. Don't see my baby.  Bay be. 
John grabs him by the lapels - pulls him to his feet. The playing cards fall to the floor -- Kyle watches them, not John. 
JOHN Kyle.  Brother Kyle. 
KYLE Cards on the floor, fifty two pickup. Black king on red queen, put the ace up -- 
John SHAKES him. 
JOHN Kyle goddammit! 
Ripley moves closer. 
RIPLEY John - it's too late -- 
Kyle begins to sing faster.  Faster. 
KYLE Ace up.  Put the ace up.  Redaceupup. Blackaceup.Up.Pup-pup-pup-chaka- boomloommawhacka -- Booomalooma looma -- 
Ripley and John look at each other. They know what this means. John pulls a length of rope off a nearby table. Moves in front of Kyle.  Looks into his glassy eyes. A tear runs down his cheek. 
JOHN Keep singing, my friend. 
John loops the rope around Kyle's neck. Strangles him. Eases the lifeless body to the floor. Stares at it. 
RIPLEY 
Pulls a blowing iron from the rack.  Feels its weight and balance.  A reasonable weapon.  She crosses to John. 
JOHN I killed him.  I'm a doctor and I killed him. 
RIPLEY You had to.  You're supposed to end suffering. 
She hands him a pontil, a pointed iron spear used to form the molten glass shapes. 
RIPLEY Let's get the hell out of here. 
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT 
Ripley and John move up the stairs. Flickering orange lit from below. Smoke and soot rise from the first on the lower floors. 
INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 
They enter carefully.  The room is exactly as John left it, books out of shelves, hanging on their chains. 
RIPLEY He's made a mess. 
John pushes ahead of her. 
JOHN No.  He hasn't been up here yet.  I did this. 
He moves to the nearest shelf and uses his pontil to pry open the lock -- 
JOHN Here - philosophy - we'll start here -- 
AAAROO --! A HAIRY BLUR flies out from between the stacks -- WHUMPH!  Knocks John to the floor -- Licks his face. 
JOHN Mattias! 
JOHN 
Finds himself HANGING over the bubbling glass vat - Caught - DANGLING on the Flying Fox rope.  Five feet away - the ledge the Flying Fox is launched from.  He looks down: 
He can see the huge open vat of molten glass below him.  To its right, the Water DUMP TANK - a large wine cask-looking affair where finished pieces are cooled.  He looks up: 
Ripley holding onto the edge of the broken floor above. 
JOHN Are you all right? 
Ripley grunts an affirmative response. At least is she falls, it will only be a twenty-foot drop to the floor.  John is looking at instant par-boiling. John starts to move hand over hand UP the rope.  He begins to sweat. A drop of sweat falls... HSSS! POPS AND SIZZLES as it hits the surface of the molten glass -- 
RIPLEY 
Tries to pull herself up to the floor above -- The next level is a raging fire. 
She can only hang and DROP.  She DOES -! Falls the two stories. Bends her knees and ROLLS on impact. 
JOHN 
Has reached the ledge overlooking the furnace. He stands.  Sees Ripley slowly rising -- 
JOHN Ripley -! 
Ripley shakily gets to her feet. Hops on one foot. 
RIPLEY Aargh.  I'm fine.  Let's get the fuck out of -- 
SUDDENLY 
THE ALIEN'S head breaks the surface of the molten glass. SCREAMING.  STEAMING.  It is white-hot - translucent -- covered with -- It looks like MOLTEN GLASS!! 
Hook-like hands grasp the edge of the tank -- It tries to climb out -- 
Ripley turns to run.  Tender ankle gives out. She falls face down on the floor -- Rolls over -- 
THE ALIEN is going to climb out of the vat -- She SCREAMS -- 
JOHN 
Grabs the Flying Fox handle. SWINGS down the rope - across the room -- PAST the Alien -- 
It turns away from Ripley - She scrambles across the floor... 
John lands HARD. Points -- 
JOHN Ripley - the lever!! 
Ripley looks next to her:  a burning wooden lever. 
The Alien has one foot out of the glass furnace -- 
RIPLEY grabs the lever -- Hssssst! Putting out the fire with her hand -- Pulls -- 
THE HUGE DUMP TANK OF WATER 
DUMPS.  Empties a thousand gallons -- RAINS DOWN on the Alien. It HOWLS in pain -- 
The Molten Glass instantly COOLS -- The rapid extreme temperature change causes the beast to BE-THWOOOoooOOM -!! EXPLODE into a million pieces...!!!! 
Ripley helps John off the floor. They are battered.  Bloody. They look into the vat. The steam clears... 
The room is littered with Alien Bits. Each piece is encased in glass -- Trapped like a fly in amber. 
JOHN Saw that happen to a bottle once. 
RIPLEY (panting) Beat... Beat him - ugh -- 
She grabs her stomach as her knees give out. John gives her an arm for support. 
JOHN We've got to get to the Library -- 
RIPLEY Don't worry.  Ship.  Just -- 
They look up: 
Mattias looks down through the hole in the floor. BARKS... 
INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 
JOHN My book -- I know what to do -- 
RIPLEY What, an exorcism?  No good. 
JOHN You can't do this.  Ripley - listen to me - you're confusing feeling of guilt for actual sin - I can help you -- 
RIPLEY (ignoring) I've set a time lock.  When the pod escapes the Colony's gravitational pull this compartment will open.  Then all you have to do is get into the Stasis tube with Mattias and press the blue button.  With any luck a freighter or something will pick you up.  Good luck. 
He pounds his fists against the door. 
JOHN NO!  No, Goddammit - you can't do this. You can't let it win. 
She turns away from the door. 
RIPLEY It always wins.  We killed it, but it's still inside me -- You're my last chance. If I can keep you alive it'll make up for all those I've lost. 
JOHN Listen to me!  You have to let me try! Ripley:  You're MY only chance! 
She's listening... 
JOHN I told you Father Anselm raised me. He raised me and when he was dying I couldn't do anything to save him.  I didn't know enough.  It was my fault he died.  If you don't let me try to save you my body will live but my soul will be dead. 
Ripley turns and stares at him. 
JOHN Please. 
CUT TO: 
THE PAGE 
A MEDIEVAL ETCHING. A Monk vomits up the devil. 
Pull back as John lowers Ripley to the pod floor. John closes his eyes. Closes the book. 
He pours some water into a small plastic cup. Retrieves a small pouch of herbs.  Opens it. Wrinkles his nose - they smell -- pours these ancient medicines into the space age cup. 
RIPLEY What is this stuff? 
JOHN (forceful) Something that will make you well. Something that will make you sick. 
RIPLEY I don't -- 
JOHN Shut up and drink. 
He lifts the back of Ripley's head -- FORCES the drink down her throat. 
John swings his leg over her midsection.  STRADDLES her. Presses his two hands together in prayer. Then balls them into one fist. Takes a deep, preparatory breath... 
Ripley starts to GAG -- Cough. Her body starts to JERK -- 
John BRINGS HIS FIST DOWN INTO HER STOMACH -- WHAMM -!! 
Ripley CONVULSES -- has the dry heaves -- 
WHAM!  WHAM --! John PUMMELS Ripley's diaphragm! 
She sputters -- VOMITS a thick mucous-like substance -- HEAVES -- 
Ripley's back arches -- She SCREAMS a gut wrenching WAIL -- Her torso BULGES as the creature is forced upwards. 
John BEARS down -- Pushes UP under her ribs -- FORCING the chest-burster up her throat -- 
Ripley fights for air as the alien STOPS halfway up her esophagus -- She's choking -- 
John crosses himself -- takes a deep breath -- Lowers his mouth to hers -- Inhales.  Exhales.  CPR. 
THE ALIEN CHEST BURSTER 
SLITHERS out of Ripley's mouth -- 
INTO JOHN'S!! Reptilian tail whips about before disappearing down his gullet. 
John falls back against a computer console. Gagging.  Fights to speak. 
Ripley raises herself up on one elbow. Alien mucous drooling down her chin. Hair matted against her forehead. 
RIPLEY Why? JOHN Choking.  It was the only way. 
He drops the open book in front of her: She sees the etching.

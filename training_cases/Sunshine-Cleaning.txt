FADE IN: 
1   EXT. ALBUQUERQUE - DAY                                            1 
ROSE LORKOWSKI, 30, drives through Albuquerque. She passes small adobe houses, the Air force base, parched earth playgrounds, University cafes and other distinctive sights. 
On the   highway she passes under the freeway interchange, a tangle   of rust and turquoise ramps. The Sandia mountains rise in the   distance as Rose heads up to the nicer neighborhoods of the   foothills. 
2   EXT. SEVEN FIGURE HOUSE - DAY                                     2 
Rose pulls up to an expensive looking Spanish style house and parks. She gets out of the car, pops the hatch and pulls out a vacuum cleaner and assorted cleaning supplies. 
3   INT. SEVEN FIGURE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                       3 
Rose drags a vacuum cleaner into a room where expensive decor collides with the debris of a recent party. 
She collects beer bottles from end tables, book shelves and house plants. Cigarette butts float in cocktail glasses. 
Rose plugs in the vacuum cord and glances out the sliding glass doors. A group of twenty somethings frolic in the pool. 
A lanky trust funder slides open the door and drips water onto the carpet as he makes his way to retrieve a cold beer. 
He brushes past Rose on his way back out. Rose turns on the vacuum and wonders if he even saw her. 
4   INT. FAIR N SQUARE MARKET - DAY                                   4 
The space is packed with every kind of snack imaginable. JOE LORKOWSKI, 53, talks as the OWNER stocks shelves. 
OWNER I've got the five stores here and then two in Rio Rancho.

JOE That's fantastic. See, if we're talking that kind of volume I can absolutely massage the numbers a little. Seriously, you're not gonna be able to keep it on the shelf. 
Joe pulls out some order forms. 
OWNER Yeah, I'd need to look at some things before I can place an order. 
The owner looks at Joe's business card. 
OWNER How about I give you a call if I decide to-- 
JOE I'll call you. Not a problem. No problem at all. Even better, I'll swing by. You're on my route. How `bout that? I'll swing by tomorrow. 
OWNER Yeah, tomorrow's not good. 
JOE Thursday then. That's better anyway. That'll give you a chance to take a look see on those other stores. We'll put everything on one order and get you a good price break. 
The owner seems to consider the offer. Joe scans the shelves. 
JOE My advice to you - weed out some of this weaker product to make more space for the corn. Like this... 
Joe reaches over and grabs a packet of organic fruit bar. 
JOE Apricot Fruit Leather. Whose bright idea was it to stock that? I mean come on, what self respecting kid asks his mom for apricot fruit leather?

The owner is not amused. 
5   EXT. FAIR N SQUARE MARKET - DAY                                 5 
Joe pulls a hand cart stacked high with Fancy Corn canisters to his rusted Monte Carlo. 
6   EXT. LUCKY BOY RESTAURANT - DAY                                 6 
Through the glass pane we see disgruntled waitress, NORAH LORKOWSKI (25). She appears to be in a heated argument with MR. KIM, the restaurant owner. A customer watches the exchange with amusement. 
Norah takes off her apron, throws it at Mr. Kim. Norah exits the restaurant. Mr. Kim trails her. Then MRS. KIM notices and joins the fray. 
MR. KIM You are fired. 
NORAH I so don't care. 
Norah flips him off and walk down the street. As she continues to walk she realizes that quitting her job might not have been the best decision ever. 
NORAH Fuck.

7    INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - DAY                          7 
A banana floats in the toilet. OSCAR LORKOWSKI, 7, smiles and kicks the flush lever. Whoosh... the banana is sucked down the drain. Gone. 
Well, not quite. Oscar watches water fill the basin and spill onto the floor. Oscar turns and walks out. 
8    INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                           8 
Oscar steps from the bathroom and walks quickly down the empty hall. 
9    INT. BUSINESSMAN'S CAR -   SPORTING GOODS STORE LOT - DAY        9 
A BUSINESSMAN removes a single shotgun shell from the glove compartment. He drops it in his shirt pocket, sprays breath freshener in his mouth and gets out of his car. 
NORAH It was just Mr. Kim being a dick head. 
ROSE I thought you liked Mr. Kim. 
NORAH Yeah, before Mrs. Kim started working there. Now he's a full on gym teacher, I swear to God. 
ROSE When are you going to grow up and start taking responsibility for-- 
NORAH Oh please, you love it when I fuck up. Love it. Me screwing up gives you the hugest woody. 
ROSE Shut up and take the ten. 
Norah takes the ten. Rose looks at the TV. 
NORAH There was a diner scene earlier. With a waitress. 
Rose looks at Norah. 
ROSE Any pie? 
Norah smiles and opens the door to leave. 
NORAH Completely pie free.

21   INT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                      21 
Rose wraps the vacuum cleaner cord while another MOLLY MAID wipes down the last window. 
Through the window, a smartly dressed pregnant woman walks toward the house with shopping bags in hand. 
MOLLY MAID The lady's here. 
Rose nods and heads downstairs. 
22   INT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                             22 
PAULA DATZMAN-MEAD sets her bags down on the table and fishes a checkbook from her purse. Rose enters with the vacuum cleaner in tow. 
ROSE We're all finished. Since it's our first visit we did the blinds and appliances but normally we'll alternate those weekly. Nobody mentioned anything to us about laundry so we didn't bother with that but if you want laundry included there is an extra... 
PAULA Rose? Rose Lorkowski? 
Startled, Rose looks the woman in the eye for the first time. 
PAULA It's Paula Datzman... cheerleading squad junior year. 
Recognition punches Rose in the face. 
ROSE Paula Datzman. Wow. 
Awkward silence. 
ROSE How are you? 
PAULA Great! I'm Paula Datzman-Mead now.

ROSE Congratulations. 
PAULA Thanks. We're expecting our second in a couple of months. 
Paula pats her swollen belly and Rose forces a smile. 
PAULA How are you? You look just the same. 
ROSE I'm good. Really good! 
PAULA God, I always envied you so much. Head cheerleader... dating the quarterback... So did you and Mac end up getting married? 
ROSE Nope. No. (Awkward silence) I'm not sure...I think he ended up marrying Heather Volkman. 
PAULA Wow. Well it's so good to see you. Let me get your info so I can send you an invite to the baby shower. 
Paula gets a piece of paper and a pen and hands it to Rose. 
PAULA It'll be like a big reunion. The whole gang from high school will be there. 
Rose writes her number and address on the scrap of paper. 
PAULA So what are you doing now? 
Woops. Paula immediately regrets the question. 
ROSE I... I've just gotten my real estate license, and so...

PAULA Real estate? 
ROSE Yeah, this... this is just kind of a temporary thing and I'm about to just really phase over into the real estate full time. 
PAULA You're kidding, I'm in real estate! 
Paula pulls a business card from her purse and hands it to Rose. The card has a picture of Paula's smiling face. 
PAULA With Long and Foster. Who are you with? 
Oscar steps closer. Joe twists something on the binoculars and pushes the lenses closer together to accommodate Oscar's small face. Better. 
JOE Those were your grandma's. She'd watch birds with those. 
Oscar walks around the room examining various objects and clunks them against a lamp in the process. 
JOE Hey, hey. Careful. 
Joe holds out his hand to retrieve the binoculars. 
JOE Why don't we put those away. 
Oscar doesn't want to. He hesitates. Joe raises an eyebrow. Oscar shuffles back to his grampa and hands them over. 
(CONTINUED)

OSCAR Why can't I play with them? 
JOE Because it's not a toy. It's a scientific instrument. 
Oscar's disappointed. 
JOE You can play with them when I'm around to supervise. 
OSCAR You're around now. 
JOE I'm tired now. 
Joe studies the binoculars for a moment and then sets them back on the shelf. 
29   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                              29 
Rose shakes her head and hands Norah another dish. 
ROSE Well I'm not putting him in special ed. I'll figure out a way to put him in private school before I do that. 
NORAH Rose, you buy generic cigarettes with couch change. How are you gonna pay for private school? 
JOE Who's going to private school? 
Rose turns and sees her dad leaning in the door way. 
ROSE Nobody dad, we're just talking. 
JOE Oscar get suspended again? 
Yes, that's it.

JOE The kid's a little strange. What? That's against the law now? It's not like he's out killing kittens or any damn thing. I swear everyone's so damn uptight these days. 
29A   INT. FAIR AND SQUARE - DAY                                       29A 
Oscar rides a mechanical horse. 
Rose pushes a cart down the isle and dials her cell phone. She grabs a box of cereal and tosses it in her cart. 
30    INT. MAC'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                                    30 
Mac sits at the table with a cup of coffee and reads the paper. A young girl holds out the telephone. 
MAC Hello. 
INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION 
ROSE Mac, it's me. 
MAC What are you doing calling here? 
ROSE I know, I'm sorry. 
MAC Heather could have easily-- 
ROSE I thought she had yoga on Saturdays. 
MAC Still, it's not cool.

30B   EXT. FAIR AND SQUARE - DAY                                           30B 
Rose and Oscar walk to the car with the groceries. 
31    INT. FAMILY RESTAURANT - NIGHT                                          31 
The Lorkowski family dines in style. 
ROSE (O.S.) Are you even listening? 
Norah turns to face Rose at the other side of the table. 
NORAH No thanks. 
ROSE What do you mean `no thanks'? What else do you have to do? You don't have a job. You don't go to school. What, are you going to live with Dad the rest of your life? 
39   EXT. BAR - DAY                                                        39 
Joe walks though a low rent part of town carrying a barrel of Fancy Corn. He ducks into the neighborhood bar. 
40   INT. BAR - DAY                                                        40 
Joe enters a dingy little corner bar where everyone's a regular. A couple of old guys slump over the bar. The BARTENDER smiles. 
BARTENDER Hey Joe, what you got for me? 
JOE World's finest corn snack. 
Joe hands the canister to the bartender and sits down on a stool. The bartender pours him a beer.

BARTENDER See where old Miller's house sold? 
Joe nods. A grizzled REGULAR nearby looks over at Joe. 
REGULAR Bet you could get a chunk of change for your place. You should cash out now before the market turns sour. 
Joe shakes his head. 
JOE I'm not selling my house. No way. I don't care how much those idiots would shell out for it. I got history in that house. You think they understand about history? 
REGULAR Still... How much commission you get on that popcorn? Bet you gotta sell a lot of corn to- 
JOE Hey, the corn's good. Really good. Not like the pet food but that was a phenomenon. 
The bartender sets a basket of cheddar popcorn in the space between Joe and the grizzled regular. 
JOE It'll get there. Takes time to get to know the market. Develop a relationship with the buyers. But it'll get there. Who doesn't like popcorn for Christ's sake. 
REGULAR My brother-in-law's in sales. 
The regular scoops up a handful of powdery orange popcorn. 
REGULAR Last year he buys a cow. 
JOE Why would you buy a cow?

REGULAR Not a live cow. A whole butchered cow from a rancher. On the hoof they call it. 
JOE Mm hmm. 
Joe looks at him with renewed interest. 
REGULAR He sells off the parts of this cow to a bunch of restaurants. Direct. Made a killing. 
The grizzled man licks orange powder from his fingers. 
JOE What'd he do with the brains and intestines? 
Regular shrugs. Joe's wheels are turning. 
JOE So he cuts out the middle man. Not a bad idea. 
Joe takes a drink of his beer while he mulls it over. 
JOE Course it'd be smarter to do that with something that didn't have bad parts. Like... shrimp. 
41   EXT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - SIX DAYS LATER - MORNING                    41 
Another day in paradise. 
42   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NORAH'S BEDROOM - MORNING                   42 
Norah sleeps in her clothes and makeup from the previous night. Knocking wakes her. 
JOE (though the door) Rose is on the phone. Norah? 
NORAH I'm sleeping.

JOE She says it's important. 
With great effort Norah picks up the receiver. 
NORAH What do you want? 
ROSE Mac got us another gig. 
NORAH I'm sleeping. 
ROSE I'll pick you up in an hour. 
NORAH No. 
43   EXT. ALBUQUERQUE - DAY                                                 43 
Rose's Nissan rolls down a rough looking Albuquerque street toward a trailer park. 
44   INT. ROSE'S CAR - DAY                                                  44

Rose and Norah struggle to transport the stinking mattress to the dumpster. It is a clumsy process. The thing tips and falls on Norah. 
52   INT. MALL - CANDY STORE - DAY                                         52 
Tucked inside a mall, the candy store does brisk business. Pimple-faced clerks ring up clumps of overweight families. 
Oscar pretends to look at hard candies while he listens to Joe and the MANAGER. 
MANAGER You're telling me this Fancy Corn stuff is some kind of health food? 
JOE Well, it's a candy... and a health food. Absolutely. Absolutely. 
MANAGER Yeah, I don't know. We don't have much more shelf space. 
Oscar spots a GIRL perusing wax lips. She looks to be about five or six. Joe ignores the manager and reads ingredients off a Twizzler package. 
JOE Glycerol monostearate? What is that? I can't even read that. 
Joe spins a can of Fancy Corn around and points to the ingredients. 
JOE Read that. 
The manager leans close. 
MANAGER High fructose-- 
JOE No. The first thing listed. The number one ingredient.

MANAGER Corn. 
JOE Exactly. Corn. Can you think of anything more wholesome? It's all American for Christ's sake. 
The manager's not buying it. Oscar takes action. He positions himself next to the girl. 
OSCAR Do you know if they sell fancy corn here? 
The girl looks at him suspiciously. 
OSCAR Do you even know what fancy corn is? 
GIRL Yes. 
OSCAR Well, do they sell it here? 
GIRL I dunno. 
She looks back to the lips and tries to ignore Oscar. 
OSCAR I heard that the strawberry fancy corn gives you bionic strength. 
GIRL That's stupid. 
OSCAR It's true. Some kind of chemical in the strawberry flavoring. If you eat a whole lot of it, it gives you bionic strength. 
The girl gives Oscar a long stare. 
GIRL I don't believe you. 
OSCAR I don't care if you do or not.

The girl watches him for a moment and then walks over and tugs her mother's shirt. 
JOE I read where these chemicals are getting into the streams, making hermaphrodidic frogs! You think mothers want to expose their kids to that stuff? No way. More and more people are looking for healthy alternatives which is why the demand for this product is so huge right now. 
MANAGER Like I said, I already put in all the orders I want for this year. 
Just then, the GIRL'S MOTHER walks up to the manager. 
GIRL'S MOTHER Excuse me. Do you carry something called fancy corn? 
Joe looks at Oscar. Oscar smiles.

Much progress has been made on the trailer. Rose and Norah work on the last remaining piles of trash. 
NORAH It seems wrong though doesn't it... to throw everything away. 
Rose tosses a tattered fanny pack onto the heap in the garbage can. Norah plucks it out and opens it. 
Norah pulls out a PHOTO ID. She holds it up. The woman on the ID looks street-worn and crazy. 
NORAH I bet this is her. 
MAC I can't believe you... I mean, I feel like I got you into this mess. 
Her sense of pride wilts. Her hand instinctively reaches up to massage the nicotine patch on her arm. 
ROSE No, I-- 
MAC Listen, I'm gonna pay for new real estate classes. Okay? 
Rose looks at Mac. Shrugs. Mac smiles.

MAC We'll get you your license and then get you a little photo in the real estate section. You can drive people around all day and talk about... Gosh, what would you talk about? (Suddenly very serious) Crown molding? 
Rose smiles. Apparently it's some private joke. 
ROSE Oh yeah, definitely talk about crown molding. 
The phrase seems to send a ripple of pleasure through Mac. 
ROSE Property easements, square footage, appliances... 
Mac reacts to each word as if it were some filthy sex talk. He looks at Rose and raises an eyebrow. 
MAC You're holding out on me. 
Rose rolls her eyes and laughs. 
ROSE Freak. 
MAC Say it. Come on. One time. 
She smiles and shakes her head. Mac waits. Rose relents. 
ROSE Curb appeal. 
Mac growls and pounces on Rose. It's fun and light. Rose laughs while Mac makes a show of mauling her neck. 
He falls on the bed and reaches out. Rose takes his hand. It's rough against hers. There's a circular indentation where his wedding ring isn't. 
Rose stops laughing. She touches the invisible ring. 
ROSE Why'd you pick her?

Mac looks up. Buzz kill. The residue of a smile fades. 
MAC You know it wasn't like that. 
ROSE How was it like? 
He takes a step back. 
MAC Are you going to do that? 
ROSE No. 
MAC If this is going to get all heavy-- 
ROSE No. 
Rose turns around and kisses Mac. One of those soft, teasing kisses that ends with a look that kicks things in gear. 
59   EXT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - TWO DAYS LATER - DAY                  59 
Rose pulls her car up to one of many warehouses in the area and double checks the address on a scrap of paper. 
60   INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - DAY                                   60 
Rose and Norah enter this no frills operation. Cinder block walls and concrete floors. A small TV on the front counter offers up a not-so-classic afternoon movie line up. 
As they approach, the clerk drops out of sight behind the counter. Rose leans over to see the clerk on his knees searching for something small and lost. 
ROSE Winston? 
WINSTON, 35, crudely handsome with dark unkempt hair and full lips, looks up. 
ROSE I spoke with you on the phone. I'm Rose Lorkowski.

Rose sticks out her right hand. 
Winston stands to reveal he is missing his right arm. He clumsily shakes her hand with his left. 
ROSE So, our situation is... 
On the TV, a waitress enters the frame. Rose stops. She and Norah both turn and look at the TV. 
The waitress pours coffee and exits the frame without a word. Rose and Norah turn back to Winston. Rose continues. 
ROSE We're doing some postmortem kind of um... specialized cleaning stuff and we had this really difficult... 
NORAH Smelly. 
Rose looks at Norah and nods. 
ROSE I'll drop Oscar by around seven. 
NORAH (sarcastically) You have class tonight? 
Rose smiles uncomfortably. 
ROSE Mortgage lenders and financing. 
Norah shakes her head in disgust. 
NORAH Heather's pregnant again. Did you know that? He's never going to leave her. 
Rose clenches her jaw and picks at a crack in the steering wheel. Norah gets out of the car. 
NORAH God, you're pathetic. 
Norah slams the door and watches Rose drive off. 
Norah stands at the door well and scans the apartment number listings. She sees the name she's looking for, LYNN WISEMAN. 
Just then, LYNN, the woman from the photos, opens the door and walks past. Caught off guard, Norah follows her.

64   FOLLOWING THROUGH STREETS                                          64 
They walk several blocks, Norah keeping a safe distance behind Lynn. 
65   EXT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES BUILDING - DAY                     65 
Lynn opens the door to the building and disappears inside. Norah follows.

Lynn steps into an elevator. Norah does too. 
67   INT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY          67 
The doors close. Lynn slaps the `stop elevator' button. Norah emits a small yelp. 
LYNN Who are you? 
NORAH What? 
LYNN Why are you following me? 
NORAH I'm not following you. 
LYNN You are following me! 
Lynn freezes for a moment. It seems she isn't even breathing. Her anger twists into fear. 
LYNN Aren't you? 
Norah remains silent. Lynn paces back and forth. 
LYNN Oh no. 
NORAH What?

LYNN Shit! This is not happening. 
Norah is uncomfortable. Lynn spins around to face Norah. 
LYNN Listen, I'm sorry. I thought... I thought you were following me. 
NORAH That's all right. 
Lynn steps closer. 
LYNN You think I'm crazy. 
NORAH No. No I don't. 
LYNN I'm not crazy. 
NORAH It was a mistake. No big deal. 
Lynn smiles. Norah releases the stop button. Nothing happens. 
LYNN It's not moving. 
NORAH Let's press the alarm button. 
Lynn shrugs. Norah presses the alarm button. There's a loud quick ring. They wait for something to happen. 
An awkward silence hangs in the air. Norah gives it another quick punch for good measure. Smiles. They look at the ceiling. They look at the floor. Norah makes little noises. 
Norah takes out her sign language book. She steals a quick sideways look at Lynn before settling on the series of small, illustrated hands before her. 
LYNN Go to the university? 
NORAH Me? No. 
Lynn leans close and checks out the book.

NORAH Yeah well, what about Dad? 
ROSE Oh please, Dad would survive just fine. You should do it. 
As Norah thinks about a possible move glistening rivulets of chocolate ice cream drip down Oscar's cone, over his hand and on to Norah's leg. 
NORAH Ahh! Lick around the base. Secure the perimeter. (To Rose) Don't you teach this kid anything? 
Norah demonstrates proper technique. She extends her tongue out to the bottom edge of the dripping glob, then twirls the cone to lick away the troublesome chocolate. 
LYNN (O.S.) It's the gorilla girl. 
Norah looks up to see Lynn with a milk shake in hand. An involuntary smile breaks across Norah. 
LYNN You never came to donate. 
NORAH Yeah. 
Lynn looks at Rose. An awkward moment passes. 
NORAH My sister. 
Rose smiles, nods a hi. Something familiar about the girl nags at Rose. She searches to connect a face out of context. 
Lynn eyes Norah. Chemistry. 
LYNN We have snacks you know. Juice boxes. 
NORAH Had I known about the juice boxes...

SHERM You still selling that luggage? 
JOE No, no. That was a whole big mess. 
SHERM Crappy zippers. Wasn't that it? 
Sherm smiles. Joe's smile disappears. 
JOE Yeah, that's been a while now. Dropped the luggage around the time your other lot when out of business. 
Touche. Sherm's smile dissolves. 
SHERM I could maybe drop it to nineteen even.

Rose has no idea how to respond. Norah turns to face Oscar. 
NORAH It just means your mom wasn't married when she had you. It's no big deal. In a couple of years you're gonna find it's a free pass to cool. You'll probably start a band called Bastard Son. Use it to impress the chicks. Trust me, the whole bastard thing... it's working for you. 
Oscar looks to Rose and then back to Norah. 
Rose's phone rings. She answers it, relieved for the distraction 
ROSE Hello, Sunshine Cleaning... Well, I'm glad you liked the Fancy Corn....Okay, yeah, yeah. 
Rose grabs a pen, hands it to Norah and motions for her to write something down.

Rose pulls the van up to the house and sees the old lady sitting out front. MRS. DAVIS. 
ROSE Oh, man. 
Rose and Norah exchange a look and then Rose turns to Oscar. 
ROSE OK. Stay in the van. You want a soda or anything? 
Oscar shakes his head. 
ROSE We won't be long. 
As Rose and Norah get out and unload supplies the old lady stands to greet them. She's dressed up in the way old ladies are when they expect company. 
ROSE Mrs. Davis? 
The woman nods. She is dazed with grief. 
ROSE We're the cleaning service. 
MRS. DAVIS Yes, yes. I... I wanted to give you the keys. 
The old woman holds out a shaky hand. Rose gently takes the keys. Norah hangs back. 
MRS. DAVIS In the sunroom. That's where my husband... I had bridge and... 
She blinks twice, slowly, then snaps back.

ROSE No, no. I think we can find it.

Rose and Norah gather their things and head up the stairs. 
MRS. DAVIS My son-in-law's coming to take me to lunch at the Howard Johnson's. They have such nice rolls there. 
Rose hands Norah the key and motions for her to go ahead. 
ROSE Would you like to sit for a moment, Mrs. Davis? 
MRS. DAVIS Yes dear, I think I would. 
Rose sits down on the steps with Mrs. Davis and Norah quietly enters the house. 
From the van Oscar watches Rose and the old woman sit side by side on the front step. Rose's hand rests lightly on the woman's bony shoulder. Words seem useless.

Norah looks around the room furnished modestly with a mixture of antiques and things that are simply old. 
Yellow sticky notes cling to doors, walls, light switches, etc. Each note contains a simple instruction such as `turn off light' or `watch news at 6:00'. 
Norah walks past family photos that line the hall.

A yellow square sticks to a picture frame on the coffee table. The frame holds the image of a smiling young couple in a different era. The note reads `Edna plays bridge at 4:00'. 
Norah slips a Tyvec jumper on and looks out the window. A car pull up to the curb. Norah stops and watches her sister walk Mrs. Davis to the car before starting her work.

NORAH You made it seem so fun. 
LYNN Oh it is fun. Would you like a refreshment? 
Norah smiles and shakes her head. 
LYNN No? 
Norah watches Lynn's hands push up her sleeve. Lynn rubs iodine in expanding circles on the inside of Norah's arm. 
Lynn puts plastic gloves on and ties a tourniquet around Norah's arm. She puts a rubber ball in Norah's hand. 
LYNN Can you squeeze that for me? 
Norah squeezes the ball and Lynn touches the plump vein.

NORAH Oh my God, is that the needle? It's a fucking cocktail straw. 
Norah looks nervous. Lynn smiles reassuringly. 
LYNN Trust me, I'm very good at this. Squeeze again. 
Norah squeezes, Lynn touches the soft blue stripe of blood beneath Norah's skin and slides the needle into the vein. 
LYNN Wasn't that fun? 
NORAH You might have oversold it. 
Lynn smiles. 
LYNN Kind of twirl the ball around in your hand. Good. It doesn't hurt, does it? 
NORAH (shakes her head) Feels hot. 
LYNN That's a good sign. 
Norah self-consciously nods and smiles. Lynn turns and jostles the bag of blood.

OSCAR What's that? 
WINSTON This is a World War Two Mitchell Cannon Nose Bomber. 
Oscar leans in closer to examine all the tiny pieces. 
OSCAR You make all these models? 
Winston nods and points to a teeny plastic strut.

WINSTON Dab the end of that in the glue. Just a little bit. 
Oscar carefully dabs the plastic piece in the puddle of glue and hands it to Winston. 
OSCAR What's that piece for? 
WINSTON It's a strut. 
With delicate precision, Winston attaches the piece. 
OSCAR What's a strut? 
WINSTON Supports the wing. 
Oscar examines one of the many completed models. 
OSCAR Seems like it'd be hard to build models with just one hand. 
WINSTON It is. 
140    EXT. ISOLATED ROAD - AFTERNOON                                       140

Rose pulls the Nissan in. She checks her lipstick in the rearview mirror before getting out and heading to the door. 
141    EXT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - AFTERNOON                               141

Norah examines a snapshot on the fridge. A chubby middle-aged woman surrounded by cats. The woman is bald and smiling. 
Norah spots some incense. She holds a stick to her nose. 
143   INT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON                143 
Norah lights the incense stick and sets it on the dresser next to a little statue of the laughing Buddha. A collection of cat whiskers sits in the Buddha's lap. 
Evidence of death soils the bed. Books crowd the night stand. Living with Breast Cancer, Foods That Fight Cancer, and Coming to Terms With Death.

Norah rolls out plastic sheeting and prepares the room. 
144   INT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - GREAT ROOM - AFTERNOON                   144 
The room titters with wannabe country clubbers. They nibble appetizers around a pastel tower of gifts. 
Rose lifts a cheese puff to her mouth. She's flanked by Paula and a MOUSEY WOMAN in a pink dress and matching pink pumps. 
MOUSEY So Rose, what are you doing? Are you still cleaning houses? 
PAULA Rose has gone into real estate. 
MOUSEY Really? 
ROSE Actually, I own my own business. 
MOUSEY A real estate business? 
ROSE No. It's a biohazard removal and crime scene clean up service. It's a growth niche industry right now ­ highly technical and competitive. 
MOUSEY What does that mean ­ biohazard removal whatever? 
ROSE A lot of times, when somebody dies, it can be kind of, you know, messy. So, we go in and clean up all that left over mess. Make sure that the area is clean and sanitary. 
Paula and Mousy exchange a glance infused with disgust. 
ROSE People just don't understand the health and safety risks involved in disposing of biological material like blood and body fluids.

It hits Rose that she does not belong here. And for the first time, she does not want to belong here. She turns to Paula. 
ROSE You know what? I... uh...Actually, there's somewhere I need to be. 
PAULA Oh nooo! You can't leave now. We're just starting the games. 
ROSE Yeah. Well... (smiles and nods) Yeah. 
Rose stands and weaves her way through the throng of Stepford moms. Relief sweeps across her face as she nears the door. 
150   INT. ROSE'S CAR - EVENING                                         150

151   EXT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - NIGHT                                151 
Rose pulls up near the fire trucks and still smoldering house. Rose steps from the car with an expression of horror. 
Fear grips her as she scans the area for her sister. Then she sees Norah, sitting in the van across the street. Headphones on. Kitten curled up in her lap. 
Rose marches over but Norah doesn't notice her until she raps on the window. Norah pulls off her headphones, opens the door and slides out of the van. 
NORAH It was an accident. 
Rose's mouth slackens as her mind stumbles over the probable consequences of the scene before her. 
ROSE Oh my God, what have you done? 
NORAH It was an accident.

ROSE How does this happen? Huh? How do you burn down a house, Norah? Jesus fucking Christ! 
NORAH Jesus Rose, Calm down. 
Rose throws her keys at Norah. 
Norah turns to shield the kitten. The keys thump her arm. Norah eyes her sister. So that's how it's gonna be. 
NORAH Well, if you had been here to help me but no, you're off desperately trying to impress stupid high school people who don't even matter. Prove to your old cheerleading squad that you're not this huge loser. If you had been here doing your job it wouldn't have happened. So don't try to put all this on me. 
Norah's denial of responsibility knocks the wind from Rose. 
ROSE This is on you. You did this. You set a fucking house on fire! You. 
NORAH Oh, go ahead and play the martyr. It's like your favorite thing. 
ROSE I can't believe I was so stupid to think that you could handle a little bit of responsibility. 
NORAH I am   so sick of all your holier than   thou bullshit. Why don't you take   a look at you're own life, huh?   You're a real inspiration. 
ROSE Well maybe if I didn't have to take care of everybody in this family.

NORAH Fuck you. I'm done being your excuse. 
Norah, filthy with soot, turns and walks away from Rose, the fire and everything. The kitten clings to her shirt. 
ROSE Oh that's great. Turn everything to shit and then walk away. 
Without turning or breaking her stride, Norah flips off Rose. 
Rose leans down and picks up her keys, then turns and watches the firemen hose down the house. 
152   EXT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - NIGHT                                 152 
Rose, looking worse for wear, tries to open the door but the store is closed and the door is locked. 
ROSE Great. 
She bangs on the glass doors. 
153   INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - NIGHT                                 153 
Winston walks from the back room and opens the door. 
WINSTON Long baby shower. 
ROSE I'm sorry, I... everything's horrible. 
Rose is about to break. 
WINSTON Oscar's asleep in back. 
ROSE Norah's ruined everything. She burnt down a house. A client's house.

WINSTON Yeah. 
ROSE You know? 
WINSTON Carl told me. 
ROSE How does he...? 
ROSE No, I like it very much. 
Rose looks up and Mac senses something bad is coming his way. 
ROSE It's just this thing we're doing. 
MAC Come on, let's not do that. 
But Rose is resolute. She looks Mac in the eye. 
ROSE I don't want this anymore. 
Disbelief gives way to the unpleasant understanding. 
MAC So that's it? 
Rose gives an almost imperceptible nod. Mac tries hard to ignore the rising slurry of hurt and anger. 
MAC That's it then. 
Mac hesitates, hoping for a last minute reprieve. Finally, he nods and Rose watches him walk away. 
158   INT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES ­ ONE WEEK LATER - DAY            158 
Norah steps off the elevator. People in white coats walk past her, bump into her. Norah spots Lynn. 
Lynn sees Norah and looks away. 
GUY IN WHITE COAT (O.S.) Is this your first time donating? 
Norah turns to the GUY IN THE WHITE COAT addressing her. He holds a clipboard. 
NORAH No.

GUY IN WHITE COAT Can I get your name? 
NORAH I need to talk to Lynn. 
Lynn approaches. 
LYNN She can't donate. You can't donate. 
She points to a sign indicating how often people can donate. 
LYNN Forty-eight days. It's not been forty-eight days. 
NORAH Why are you acting like this? Why haven't you called me back. 
LYNN Listen, I just, don't think you're the kind of person I need to be hanging out with right now. 
NORAH What's that supposed to mean? 
LYNN Do I really need to spell it out? 
Norah stands stunned. Sad. Blank. She pulls the packet of photos out of her bag and holds them out to Lynn. 
NORAH Here. 
Lynn takes the packet. As she walks back to the reclining blood donors she tosses the photos in a trash can. 
A smiling Korean woman gives Norah a cup of juice and puts an `I gave blood today' sticker on her chest. 
159   EXT. TINGLEY PARK- DAY                                            159 
Joe sits on a bench near the pond with his feet propped up on a canister of Fancy Corn. He reaches into the open canister next to him and pulls out a handful of gourmet corn.

A few pieces land in his mouth, the remainder he tosses to a flotilla of ducks. Joe smiles as the greedy little bastards squabble over his offering.

Rose and Oscar struggle to unload the super wet-vac from the van. Other equipment litters pavement around the van. 
Winston records serial numbers onto a clipboard. 
WINSTON I'm sure I can turn this stuff around pretty quick. 
ROSE Thanks. For everything. 
OSCAR Are you coming to my party? 
Awkward moment. Rose looks from Oscar to Winston. 
ROSE We're going to Hinkle's Saturday for Oscar's birthday. It'd be great if you came. 
WINSTON Sounds like a blast. 
Rose smiles at the sincere enthusiasm in Winston's voice. 
161   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT                            161 
Rose steps out of the shower and wraps her hair in a towel. As she walks past the mirror she plucks off the affirmation note and tosses it in the trash. 
162   INT. HINKLE'S RESTAURANT - A FEW DAYS LATER - DAY               162 
Norah shakes her head. 
NORAH I've got my own ideas. 
Rose nods. As they exit, she turns to Norah. 
ROSE So, you really think he's hot? 
NORAH Winston? No. 
164   INT. HINKLE'S RESTAURANT - DAY                                 164 
Rose and Norah return from the bathroom. Joe eyeballs the girls in silent appraisal of the situation. Seems okay. 
NORAH You gonna open my present? 
Oscar opens the package of fake tattoos. 
OSCAR Cool. 
NORAH The guy said that if you're careful they'll last a whole month. And these aren't stupid kiddie unicorns and shit. They're all based on classic biker designs. 
Oscar picks up one of the tattoos.

OSCAR Cool. 
ROSE What's that say? 
NORAH Li'l bastard. 
Rose looks at Norah. 
ROSE Cool. 
Oscar slips his arm out of his sleeve and inside his shirt and stares at Winston admiringly. Rose whispers in Oscar's ear and he pulls his arm back into his sleeve. 
NORAH I'm thinking of taking a road trip. 
JOE Where? 
Shrug. 
ROSE How? 
NORAH Haven't worked it all out yet. I was thinking I could maybe take the van. 
Rose shakes her head. 
ROSE I'm selling the van. 
JOE Don't sell the van. 
ROSE Have to. Can't afford the payment. 
JOE No, listen... just don't sell the van. 
Rose forces a smile and examines her pizza. She can't watch her father cling to another impotent dream.

JOE Just don't sell the van yet. Okay? 
Oscar slowly retracts his arm again. With his remaining arm he lifts the binoculars to his face. 
JOE Rose tells me you make models. 
WINSTON Yeah. 
JOE Any money in that? 
WINSTON Not really. 
The wait staff begins to sing a birthday song. 
165   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - OSCAR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                      165 
Rose quietly kisses Oscar's forehead and pulls up the covers. She turns and steals another look before shutting the door. 
166   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                          166 
Rose sizes up her stack of unopened bills. She opens one, sighs, sets it aside. She moves on to the next one. 
The TV flickers blue light into the room. Rose stops and looks at the TV. 
167   INT. NORAH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT                         167 
The phone wakes Norah. She fumbles for the receiver. 
NORAH What? 
ROSE (over the phone) Turn your TV on. Channel sixty- five. 
Norah clicks on the TV and watches slack-jawed as a WAITRESS hands menus to two hard nosed detectives. One of the TV DETECITVES looks up and smiles.

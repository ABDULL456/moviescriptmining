Screenplay by 
Randall Jahnson and Oliver Stone 
SHOOTING DRAFT 
INT. BLACK SCREEN 
MORRISON'S VOICE The movie will begin in five moments The mindless voice announced All those unseated will await the next show We filed slowly, languidly into the hall The auditorium was fast and silent As we seated and were darkened The voice continued "The program for this evening is not new You've seen this entertainment Through and through You've seen your birth, your life and death You might recall all the rest Did you have a good world when you died? Enough to base a movie on?" 
FADE IN: 
INT. RECORDING STUDIO (LAST SESSION) - LA DEC 1970 - NIGHT 
A dark silence hovers along the deserted, bunker-like studio. MIKE stands and booms shadow a grand piano... 
The ENGINEER waits in the booth, lit, alert man, bored, fiddling... 
ENGINEER Hey Jim, It's your birthday man, whaddaya say we try this another night... 
Camera moving tentatively along the shadows, discovering the sidelight on a Navy surplus pea jacket thrown on a chair; moving to a candle's orange flutter on pages written with verse... a hand breaking the seal of the bottle of Irish Bushmill's whiskey. 
VOICE (off) Kill the lights a little more, will ya John? 
They might drop a bit more... Camera crawling past the FINGERS weaving a new cigarette out of the Marlboro pack. An ashtray full of butts... and an asthmatic horrid cough, filled with phlegm... crawling up the slight paunch in the bright jersey with #66 on it... stitched on the sleeve is the team mascot -- an American Indian in full headdress. 
ENGINEER (off) Hey man, how come the Doors aren't in on this? 
Camera revealing JAMES DOUGLAS MORRISON, -- 27, poet, buried in the shadows, curls of cigarette smoke about his haunted sensuous eyes, meditative lips scragged with beard and long greasy hair, not a pretty sight, yet a man full and bold and struggling for survival through his words... beneath the Bushmill moon, he takes the tambourine and shakes it violently in our face 
JIM No music, No Doors. Let's roll... Is everybody in?... Is Everybody in?... Is everybody in? The ceremony is about to begin... 
He shakes a TAMBOURINE at the mike and one of his sudden giant Indian YELLS rock through the studio. 
JIM WAKE UP!!!! HAS THIS DREAM STOPPED!!!! 
Music riffs from "American Prayer". AUDIENCE SOUNDS ghostly on the track. The ENGINEER reeling backwards from the sudden shift in sound, cursing silent. 
JIM VOICE Let me tell you about the heartache and the loss of God Wandering wandering in hopeless night Indian's scattered on dawn's highway bleeding ghosts crowd the young childs fragile eggshell mind... (wind sounds) 
The GRIN on Jim's face magnesium flares out to: 
EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY (1940'S) 
The blinding YELLOWNESS of the desert, so barren, so hot it stings to look at. An OLD CHEVROLET winds through the yellow- orange landscape beneath a brooding blue SKY crackling with ELECTRICITY -- the storm coming in in the distance as the MUSIC writhes out at us like a reptile from under a rock -- the beat of RIDERS ON THE STORM. 
DOORS SONG Riders on the storm (2) Into this house we're born Into this world we're thrown Like a dog without a bone An actor out on loan Riders on the storm 
CREDITS ROLL, OVER THIS DREAMSCAPE 
JIM VOICE (continues over imagery) ...me and my mother and father and grandmother and grandfather were driving through the desert at dawn and a truckload of Indian workers had either hit another car or just -- I don't know what happened... Indians were scattered all over the highway bleeding to death. 
INT. CAR - DAY 
MOM, DAD, the youngest BABY in the front seat -- pointing at the storm. 
GRANDMA & GRANDAD in the back with JIM, about 4 and his SISTER, 3 asleep. 
Mom's a beauty and Dad's an austere handsome military man in civilian clothes, mouthing words -- look, wake them up, a desert storm... but we barely hear 
A LIGHTNING BOLT shreds the blue sky with a thunderous sound, frightening dawn of creation... 
Grandma nudging Jim awake. His eyes open -- 
Just as the car turns the bend -- revealing 
An overturned TRUCK lying in the road -- dead and wounded INDIANS everywhere... A cop car, ambulance. A terrible accident... 
The first thing Jim sees... 
An old INDIAN FACE staring at him... 
The car pulling alongside, Dad rolling his window down... asking if he can help (SOUNDLESS) A line of wailing INDIAN WOMEN, CHILDREN 
Mom's scared face... 
JIM VOICE ...but it was the first time I tasted fear. I musta been about four, like a child is just like a flower, his head is floating in the breeze. 
Grandma trying to hide Jim's face but he looks back... 
THE COP WAVING THEM THROUGH 
The kid looking back through the rear window, terrified -- his first view of death. The bodies, the sense of doom overlaying the land -- a child's worst nightmare. 
MOM It's just a dream, Jimmy, just a dream 
SONG (continues) There's a killer on the road His brain is squirming like a toad Take a long holiday Let your children play If you give this man a ride Sweet family will die There's a killer on the road 
The boy's eyes going back to the Indian MAN looking at him... then to the dying opened body bleeding out its guts on the asphalt... the dying man's face, twisted, moaning, amazing eyes at the point of death -- they settle on Jim 
MOM It's just a dream Jimmy, just a dream 
A strange SOUND occurs -- the rattle of an ancient gourd, "shi-chi-chi, shi-chi-chi". Something flying through the air. A bull-roarer, a whirling leather thong, announcing the appearance of a shaman. 
INTO JIM -- his eyes staring out the back His receding point of view -- the Indians, the overturned truck... 
JIM VOICE ...The reaction I get now looking back is the soul of the ghosts of those dead Indians -- maybe one or two of them were just running around freaking out and just leaped into my soul -- and they're still there. (wind, music) 
JIM ...cause... you're the one... 
He moves. Kisses her swiftly, softly, right on the lips. 
GIRL (mesmerized, awkward) Wow... neat... (looks back) ...maybe you should meet my old man? 
JIM Later. You got a name? 
He looks into her face. Classic American face, freckles, big round eyes soft as rain, long sunset red hair. She feels his intense, starving eyes. He kisses her a second time. 
The YOUNG MAN coming back with the rolling paper -- sees him. 
As he hops back on the railing -- swings out into the tree -- looks back once. 
JIM Mine's Jim. 
A moment. She must decide. The YOUNG MAN within earshot. 
GIRL Pam... 
The ice broken in that instant. Jim smiles. 
JIM Jim and Pam, Pam and Jim... 
He vanishes. The Man abreast of Pamela, as if he's seen a vision. 
YOUNG MAN Who the hell was that? 
PAMELA (everything's cool) That's Jim. My new friend. 
INT. UCLA SCREENING ROOM - DAY (1965) 
On the screen a 16mm black and white student film of a stunning BLOND in black bra, panties, garters dancing in black heels on top of a TV set. panning down to images of goose-stepping Nazis and a Nuremberg rally on the set. Sounds of lovemaking and an Indian peyote ceremony from the track, an Indian holy man incanting... Jim's VOICE comes on the track as well. 
JIM'S VOICE Nietzche said "all great things must first wear monstrous and terrifying masks in order to inscribe themselves on the hearts of humanity". Listen children -- to the sound of the Nuremberg night. 
STUDENTS in the audience groan at the pretention of it. Moving to JIM's eyes hidden in his parka hood, peeking through at the screen. 
A CLOSEUP now of JIM on screen looking straight into the lens as he takes a hit on a hash pipe, and winks. 
JIM VOICE (on screen) Have you ever seen God? -- a mandala. A symmetrical angel. Felt? Yes. Fucking the Sun. Heard? The music. Voices. Touched? An animal. Your hand Tasted? Rare meat, corn, water and wine 
STUDENTS (ad lib) SSSSssss... ego trip man, c'mon! 
RAY MANZAREK, a tall student with powerful voice and manner, thick glasses, long hair sweeping down over his eyes, leans over to Jim. 
RAY Hey man it's great, don't listen to em, it's non-linear man, it's poetry man, everything Godard stands for. 
The lights coming on as the last absurdist images flicker off. Hissing and a big Bronx cheer summarize the feelings of the 100 odd STUDENTS crammed into a bunker-like theater. 
A youngish INSTRUCTOR stirs to the front row from a row of upset FACULTY. Hands shooting up to criticize. 
INSTRUCTOR This is pretty shocking stuff Mr. Morrison. And I might say indulgent. Naziism and masturbation, when used for shock value, are not art. But to be constructive, let's start with your intention. What was it? 
STUDENT 1 It was a bore!! That's what! (laughter) 
TRICK, BONES and JACK, three friends sitting next to Jim, shoot their hands up. 
TRICK Hey it was better'n a Warhol picture. 
GIRL 1 No it wasn't. It was worse! 
TRICK A guy sleeping for seven hours... 
STUDENT 2 ...is less pretentious! There was no political consciousness. Naziism is... 
JACK Hey hold on man! You guys are the facists! 
BONES It takes genitalism to absurdity man, just cause the squares here can't dig it cause the film school's still so square... 
VOICES Oh c'mon man, give it a break. Boo! Beatniks go home! Take another mushroom... 
A cacophony of voices, critics, emotions blend out over Jim's quiet eyes. 
INSTRUCTOR HOLD IT DOWN!!... Mr. Morrison -- what are your feelings? 
JIM I quit. (walks out) 
EXT. TURKEY JOINT WEST - NIGHT 
JIM, BONES, TRICK, JACK approaching the bar. MUSIC of "GLORIA" blasting from the door, CHICKS popping in and out, definitely college crowd circa '65. 
TRICK (to Jim) Hey man whatdya expect, an Oscar? 
BONES You can't quit, you gotta voice. People can't dig cause they don't understand yet. 
JACK If you're an individual, if you're too good, they wanna cut your dick off. Look what happened to Orson Wells. 
TRICK You quit now, they'll yank your deferment in no time and they'll get you for Vietnam man. Three more months you graduate. 
BONES Be cool, you never learned fuckin patience Morrison, you want everything at once. 
NICK They didn't get it. So make your films and fuck what they think. 
JIM You know what I think? 
He slows, a dramatic young lion pose, surveying the girls. 
BONES Yeah whadday you think? 
The two of them race down by its side, slowing to a walk. His [...] loved orphan voice. 
JIM Can I stay with you tonight? We could talk 'till dawn. I just don't want to be alone. 
PAM (hesitant) Okay... just talk though. No funny stuff. 
JIM Okay. I promise. 
PAM I've been real upset. I lost my car on the freeway yesterday. I left it somewhere and I can't remember where and when I went back it was gone. My sister... 
JIM I bet you never expected life could be this hard. (strokes her hair affectionately) And you're still so young. 
She breaks into sobs, seeking his arms. He hugs her. 
JIM I wonder where we'll be ten years from now? 
PAM I really don't want to know 
JIM Come on. 
JIM (SONG) Choose now, they croon Beneath the moon Beside an ancient lake Enter again the sweet forest Enter the hot dream Come with us Everything is broken up and dances 
EXT. VENICE BUILDING - NIGHT 
Their silhouettes mount the fire escape of a jagged old structure overlooking the boardwalk. 
EXT. VENICE ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
PAM glancing through Jim's notebooks as they sit on his sleeping bag with a lantern and bunsen burner, overlooking moon, ocean, scudding clouds and a vast forest of television antennas. Fires burn from the beach. 
In the notebooks, at intervals during the conversation, we see powerful sketches colored in visionary hallucinogenic William Blake mode with writing between. Books are everywhere -- panning Kerouac, Ginsberg, Nietzsche, Rimbaud, Mailer, Artaud, mythological works, shamanistic books, a library of stolen ideas. 
PAM (reading, looking) These are like beautiful! I never read much poetry in school. I hated it. What's a "shaman"? (mispronounces) 
JIM He's the medicine man who starts in a peyote trance. And he gets everyone in the tribe going and they share in his vision and it heals them. It's the same in all cultures -- Greeks, Jesus. Some Indians say the first shaman invented sex. He's the one who makes you crazy. 
PAM Are you a "shaman"? 
JIM Uh (pause) no. I just write about it. What turns you on? 
PAM I don't know. Experience. Freedom. Love... Now. Peyote's like love. When it's given it's blessed. When it's sold it's damned. I like peyote. I like acid, it's easier to get. I like the spiritual voyage. The first time I did acid I saw God. I did. I had a friend who was Christ. And he was Judas too. I suddenly knew the secret of everything -- that we're all one, the universe is one. And that everything is beautiful. 
JIM Is it? I don't know. I think you're alive by confronting death -- by experiencing pain. 
PAM I think you're alive by recognizing beauty -- seeing truth because when you discover truth you discover what love is... we're all saying the same thing. It's "love me and I'll love you." 
JIM (looks at her, ironic) It's only thru death that you know life. Jesus, medicine men heal people by sacrificing their own life. 
PAM Do you love Death? 
JIM I think life hurts a lot more than death. When you die the pain is over. 
Pam shivers, a strange thought. 
PAM Why do I look at you... and see my death? (pause, shrugs) No, that's ridiculous. 
JIM I bet your dad's a school teacher. 
PAM How did you know! 
JIM I don't know. 
PAM What was your father? 
JIM Military 
PAM I bet you moved around a lot. 
JIM Yeah, about 8 times. 
PAM How many sisters and brothers? 
JIM Two. 
PAM One... she's the pretty one... I love your neck. (she gets in his lap) 
He runs his fingers thru her hair, kissing her gently. 
JIM "...but one, the most beautiful one of all dances in a ring of fire and throws off the challenge with a shrug" 
PAM That's beautiful. Who did you write it for? 
JIM I wrote it for you. 
The panties coming off. Rousseau dangling from the Venice moon. He moves a little over excited, nervous, more awkward than we might expect. 
PAM ...take your time, Jim... there's no hurry, I'm all you have to do tonight... 
DOORS SONG Well the clock says it's time to close now I guess I'd better go now... As we depart the rooftop. Your fingers weak with minarets Speaking secret alphabets I light another cigarette Learn to forget, learn to forget, learn to forget 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Possibly we hear the soft backbeat of MOONLIGHT DRIVE without lyrics. 
RAY MANZAREK is meditating in yoga posture, longer hair as well, in his post-graduate phase, sandals, colorful hippie shirt. But the meditation is not going well. He's shaking his head at himself, frowning. 
RAY Om om... No bliss! No bliss! 
Jim has approached closer, amused, looking down. 
JIM Let's try it again, come on. I'm just getting into it. 
PAM (on floor) I think it's hot!! 
ROBBIE (strumming) I still think the lyrics are weird man. 
JOHN (frustrated) I still think it sounds like the bottom of a fishbowl man. 
JIM (to Robbie, aggravated) Then you write one man! We need more songs anyway. We all gotta go back and write. 
They're drained, tired, in a large rehersal/living room 30 feet high, fronted by large glass windows looking out at the beach at Marina. The room is filled with golden, gorgeous setting sunlight. 
PAMELA goes to the kitchen with DOROTHY, Ray's Japanese fiancee. 
ROBBIE I been working on something goes like this... A minor. (chords his guitar) "You know that it would be untrue You know that I would be a liar If I was to say to you Girl, we couldn't get much higher" F sharp... chorus "Come on baby, light my fire Try to set the night on fire..." 
Robbie's voice is tinny but something immediate's in the air, all the radar out. 
RAY Okay man there's some good changes in there. 
JIM Got any more lyrics? 
ROBBIE (gives Jim a page of lyrics) Some. I call it "Light My Fire". I figger if I'm gonna compete with your stuff it's gotta be about earth, fire or snakes. 
JIM Don't underestimate Death. 
JOHN Yeah but it sounds like the Byrds man, we're not folk rock man. How 'bout trying it with a Latin beat. 
ROBBIE I thought we could do the usual verse chorus verse chorus and 
JOHN We don't need a bridge. 
ROBBIE Yeah, we could maybe improvise a couple piano and guitar solos over it (kicks in second verse) "The time to hesitate is through" (doesn't have the second line) Du du duh dud dada . . . 
JIM (spontaneous) "No time to wallow in the mire Try now we can only lose And our love become a funeral pyre Come on baby light my fire" 
John drumming it, different, more Latin. 
JIM Pretty good! Pretty neat!! 
RAY (to John) Nice groove, John. Chaka chaka chaka, then bula burump bula (to Robbie) ...you're right, it could take a coupla long solos, that's wild man, like Butterfield did on "East-West" -- really hip. 
ROBBIE Y'ever heard Coltrane's "Favorite Things"? 
JOHN (hitting the drums) Yeah -- maybe stretch it out and put it in 4/4 on bass, 3/4 on guitar and snare. 
RAY (clicking, excited) Why not! A minor to B minor. Jazz! That then is jazz! But it needs a hook. Something. Give me some space. I need some space. Leave the room guys. Come on! Go! 
The three excluded Doors head out to the beach like obedient schoolboys while Ray fools with his organ. 
EXT. VENICE BEACH - DAY 
As they go out, JIM hugging ROBBIE's head to his shoulder as they feel the excitement of a new song. 
JOHN (irritated at Ray) Guy's obnoxious, man always bossin' people around! I thought we were equals! 
JIM Aren't we? (to Robbie) That was great Robbie. Whaddaya thinking about when you play? 
ROBBIE Don't know. Mostly the fish in my fish tank. 
JIM (laughs) Hey whadya say we take some of that Tijuana acid and see what kinda trouble we can get into tonight? 
ROBBIE The chicks always go for you man. I get the dogs. 
JIM Then we'll start a religion or plan a murder or go to Tijuana. 
JOHN Whatsamatter with you man, what about Pam, you got the morals of a coyote. 
JIM Why you wanna sleep with her John, just to bug me? 
JOHN Hell NO! 
JIM ...means "hell yes". She likes you man, she really does and y'all should. What's a rock and roll band for man, if you can't party all night and do bad things? 
RAY (yelling from the house) I GOT IT I GOT IT... GET IN HERE. HURRY. 
JOHN Sieg Heil! 
As they head back. 
INT. RAY'S HOUSE - DAY 
TIGHT on RAY like a schoolmaster cueing them. 
RAY Okay here it is. Bach and Rock. Count it off John 
JOHN (clicking) (crack) 
It goes. The famous organ intro to LIGHT MY FIRE blends over the room like magic, carrying JIM, ROBBIE, JOHN, DOROTHY, PAMELA along over: 
EXT. SUNSET STRIP (TRAVELLING) - NIGHT (1966) 
A row of NIGHTCLUBS glisten off the hoods of passing traffic. Marquees announce: THE BYRDS, RED ROOSTER, LOVE, THE HERD, TURTLES, CAPTAIN BEEFHEART. The CLUBS are PANDORA'S BOX, THE TRIP, CIRO'S, BIDO LITO'S, GAZZARRI'S, THE EXPERIENCE... . Headlights and neon intercut with: 
DOCUMENTARY TYPE SHOTS of TEENAGERS, HIPPIES, LONGHAIRS, running summer rampant, banging tambourines. COPS busting kids against cars on the street as PARENTS go by rolling up their windows. The action was on the street. LIGHT MY FIRE carries over the montage. 
DOORS SONG You know that it would be untrue etc. 
JIM VOICE (last session) The music was new black polished chrome and came over the summer like liquid night. 
He is in an isolated cathedral of rocks. The CRONE, muttering, leaving through another crevice. Suddenly a MOUNTAIN LION is visible, stretched hugely across a rock. It growls ferociously, upset, and suddenly shoots out the back of the cave. Silence. 
Jim, thunderstruck, gaping. A gallery of ancient INDIAN PETROGLYPHS surround him on all sides. Curious, oblong figures, buffalo, sacred deer and bear, creatures of the hunt; hunters and their weapons, rain clouds, masked deities proclaiming the answers to the Mysteries, the story of Creation. 
Camera weaving up to see one of the faces of the deities -- staring at him from the wall -- an eagle's face... 
DOORS SONG There's danger on the edge of town Ride the King's highway Weird scenes inside the gold mine Ride the King's highway west, baby 
The sound of a rattle -- "shichishichi" -- he realizes he's being watched. By what? He whips his eyes everywhere. A large LIZARD perches on a boulder assesses him calmly, tatters of a former skin clinging to its throat, spits a forked tongue and drills its black pearly eyes into his skull... Now the sound of the Bull-Roarer, whipping the air, announcing the appearance of the shaman. 
Jim's struck with an overwhelming sense of... awe... ancient mysteries. He turns. The lizard is looking at him. 
The GHOST of the DEAD INDIAN is also looking at him. We are looking at JIM from its point of view -- a blur of light, some headdress, a sense of skins... music drops back, no lyrics... the voice is old, familiar, possible Spanish descent dialect or huararchi. 
INDIAN GHOST VOICE ...you are a prince among white men, yet you are a warrior among us. You are ready now. Go out "walk with the pain of the world, travel to the end of the wind" -- and change it for all men as you were born to do. 
The voice, the pretense, -- the glow too quickly fades -- leaving Jim so alone, not sure what he has heard, yet he knows he has heard, and he knows he has seen -- and once you have seen, it will never be the same again. His eyes. 
EXT. CAVE - DAY 
JIM exits the cave. 
MATCH CUT TO: 
INT. WHISKY A GO GO - NIGHT 
EXTREME CLOSE on JIM'S EYES as he continues with THE END. 
DOORS SONG Ride the snake Ride the snake, to the lake The ancient lake The snake is long, seven miles Ride the snake He's old, and his skin is cold 
Camera pulling out from his eyes. There's something different tonight. Something in the air. His eyes are open, he's facing outward, gripping the mike for his life, hair falling in his face, dripping sweat, we sense all his soul concentrated in what he has to say. 
Cliques of GROUPIES have staked claims at the foot of the stage, eyes fucking him as he writhes, spreading his legs. Every twitch, every moment he sucks out the tension on the musical interludes generates a whip of a reaction in his audience. 
Nobody is moving in the club. The DANCERS are still, the GO GO GIRLS in their white plastic boots and dresses hang motionless in their gilded cages. Even the WAITRESSES have stopped, frozen with their trays, denying something is going to happen. 
PAMELA, DOROTHY... JERRY from the Fog, also the manager of this place, watches from the balcony, shaking his head, doesn't understand. Panning to two RECORD TYPES with him -- JAC HOLZMAN, distinguished six footer, suit, and PAUL ROTHCHILD, funky, pigtailed, ex-con, early 30s. 
JIM & DOORS The west is best (2) Get here and we'll do the rest The blue bus is calling us (2) Driver where you taking us? 
The band has come together fully now. ROBBIE'S fingers sliding across the trembling strings, staring at the ceiling, wandering around the darkened portions of stage left, he feels Jim -- echoes him back with his flamenco-blues guitar. 
JOHN on drums, reading Jim's moods, throws in the spontaneous and violent riffs that keep it savage. He literally tortures Jim's ears with his drums. 
And RAY, concentrated with his nodding head like a big flamingo over his keyboard, mixing it up, throwing curves, yet also -- and more delicately -- torturing Jim with the messianic organ sounds that shriek in his ears. There is something of Merlin in Ray -- the alchemist knowing how to play Jim. 
And JIM -- "that sneaky silent lithe flowing flexing animal" -- ready at last to share both his body and his soul with the world, to live out the words of the Indian prophet... to lead. 
JIM The killer awoke before dawn He put his boots on He took a face from the ancient gallery And he walked on down the hall 
Ray looks over up from his board, catches Robby with a 'what's this?' look... They go with it, improvising... 
Jim clutching the mike tighter, seeking solace in its arms; it all hangs in the air as if he doesn't have any idea what he's going to say next. 
JIM He went to the room where his sister lived And he paid a visit to his brother And then he went on down the hall... 
Pamela sensing something is coming... the AUDIENCE... Jerry... the go-go dancers... 
JIM And he came to a door, And he looked inside "Father?" "Yes, son?" "I want to kill you". 
FLASH -- A FATHER'S FACE, any face, older, any man... 
JIM Mother... I want to... 
FLASH -- A MOTHER'S FACE, any face, older, a woman 
JIM AAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHHH YOOOOOUUUUUUUUUU!!!!! FUCK YOU ALL NIGHT! 
The SCREAMS primal, pure Jim -- Indian savagery ripped from the depths of his soul, of his pain -- bouncing off the walls... 
As the AUDIENCE gasps, shocked, stunned... 
As the guitar hits a high, horrid reverb, JIM in slightly SLOW MOTION suddenly tightens his backbone as if electrocuted and shoots violently backwards, hitting the floor like a puppet cut from his string -- we sense Jim himself has crossed a barrier now, gone into yet another stage of his performance, a stage from which he can never return. Like the gunfighter who has killed his first man. 
RAY sees it instantly where it's going, hits the organ! Robbie and John follow. the instruments EXPLODE all at once trying to bury Jim in his primal unmistakeable scream. 
The CLUB in shock. Tribal taboo broken in one instant. Jerry exploding off the balcony toward the stage... 
Pamela, extremely moved and impressed, and Dorothy... the go- go girls, as jaded as they come, are stunned tension... the groupies love it. 
Jim has jumped up now, dancing an Indian war dance around the mike. 
JIM Come on baby take a chance with us (X3) And meet me in the back of the blue bus Doona blue rog onna blue bus Doona blue yeah! Come on yeah! 
INT. BACKSTAGE WHISKY HALLWAY - THAT NIGHT 
JIM is being muscled out the door by JERRY, livid. 
JERRY NOBODY'S GONNA FUCK THEIR MOTHER ON MY STAGE! YOU'RE OUTTA HERE. You don't ever come back to play, you don't ever come back to drink -- You're DEAD ON THE STRIP! 
JIM (ranting back at him) Kill the father, fuck the mother, kill the father, fuck the mother -- that's what I'm into! That's what I'm into! 
Jerry pinning Jim to the wall, 
JERRY You -- MORRISON! You're fucking filthy twisted perverse punk, get back to your fucking sewer!! 
JIM (calmly smiling) You have the face of a pig man. 
Lost in the melee, RAY and JOHN springing Jim back from likely death 
EXT. AIRPORT TARMAC - DAY 
Screaming FANS chase the DOORS to a commercial airplane, scribbling autographs. One of the GIRLS smacking JIM on the lips as he laughs, her cameras clicking. PAMELA shooting a home movie of it, pushed aside by the crowd, rescued by ROBBIE and the new young manager, BILL SIDDONS... 
DOORS SONG Oh show me the way to the next whisky bar Oh don't ask why Oh don't ask why 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE (SEEN FROM PLANE) - DAY 
The City as seen by: 
INT. AIRPLANE - DAY 
JIM'S face pressed to the window, PAMELA next to him hugging each other. 
JIM (real close, hugging her) I don't mind dying in a plane crash, a smile on my face. 
PAMELA (cutting his food) As compared to what? 
JIM I just don't want to go out slow -- brain tumor, botulism. I want to feel what it's like, cause death is only going to happen to you once. 
PAMELA I don't want to die ever, what a weird thing to say. 
DOORS SONG For if we don't find the next whisky bar I tell you we must die I tell you I tell you I tell you we must die 
EXT. CBS - NEW YORK - NIGHT (SUMMER, 1967) 
A LIMOUSINE pulling up in front of the Ed Sullivan Marquee. The sidewalk is mobbed with FANS, mostly YOUNG GIRLS. 
DOORS SONG Oh moon of Alabama We now must say goodbye We've lost our good ol mama We must have whiskey oh you know why 
INT. LIMO - NIGHT 
JIM looking out at the MOB with the other DOORS and PAMELA. The look on his face is ironic. 
His POV -- the YOUNG GIRLS' FACES, arms grasping at the windows like tentacles of a poisonous hydra, their faces deformed by SILENT SCREAMS (we hear faint strangled shrieks below the song)... POLICE and SECURITY pressing them back, linking arms to clear a path for the Doors. 
DOORS SONG Show me the way to the next little girl Oh don't ask why Oh don't ask why 
The GIRLS crying hysterically as Jim lazily, leopardly, moves across the CROWD, almost like Oswald waiting for the Ruby bullet but with that sweet, pleasant smile on his face, dark glasses concealing... 
GIRLS (faint) Oh Jimmmmm, pleeeaaase look, I looove youuuuu, Jimmmmmm, pleeeeeaase, Jimmmmm, here, sign miiiine... take a picture Jim?... Jim, Jim, oh please look at me Jim!! 
Their voices distorting. A GIRLCHILD squeezing thru the cordon with the fatal bullet. In slightly SLOW MOTION, Jim seeing her come... as she glues herself hip to hip, lip to lip with Jim, her hands clawing at his leather pants. It takes TWO COPS to peel her off. Pamela furious. Jim is gracious with everyone, signs patiently, talks, kisses, shakes hands with the boys, lets them touch his hair, his body, poses for a picture, seems to like it. 
DOORS SONG For if we don't find the next little girl I tell you we must die I tell you I tell you I tell you we must die 
INT. CBS BACKSTAGE - THAT EVENING 
The nervous PRODUCER, HERB, leading "MR. SULLIVAN" thru the corridor to the Doors' DRESSING ROOM past several "ACTS" getting ready to go on... animals, tumblers, a soprano wailing... 
PRODUCER Right this way Mr. Sullivan. They're called "the Doors". They got the number one single in the country -- "Light Your Fire". 
SULLIVAN "Light Your Fire"? Is that sooo? 
PRODUCER They look pretty grungy but we're... 
INT. DOORS DRESSING ROOM - EVENING 
Bedlam. MAKE-UP ARTISTS pancaking the faces of the DOORS -- the nightmare coming true. RAY in a white suit with too many pinstripes. ROBBIE a spearmint turtleneck, beads, long sideburns, JOHN in red velveteen head to foot with a tie-dye splotch on the front of it. Their hair's being violated enough by a nervous gay black HAIR DESIGNER to make them totally self-conscious and nervous about their first live TV appearance -- all except JIM who remains in his signature black leather with the silver navajo belt and shiny spangles -- watching a portable TV... A GIRL leaving his side, crossing Pamela. Eye contact between them speaks of Pamela's jealousy. 
JOHN (indignant) You're gonna cut it! 
HAIRDRESSER (doing John) No, I'm going to worship it. What kind of shampoo are you using? 
JOHN The kind you get in hotels. 
HAIRDRESSER Pamper yourself sweetheart, you don't want split ends, you're a celebrity now. (moving to Ray) You have very serious-serious hair, it needs to rebel. I'll give it a tinge of something freaky. 
RAY I'd rather stay the same color. 
HAIRDRESSER Scaredy cat. 
ROBBIE What about me? 
HAIRDRESSER (a look) Honey, we don't have enough time. 
TELEVISION INSERT -- images of DETROIT burning, summer of 
TV NEWSMAN ...here in Detroit, 42 people dead, more than 2000 injured... 1400 buildings burned, 5000 people have just lost their homes as Detroit joins more than 100 cities torn by riots this hot summer! 
On JIM, as they pancake him, reflective. 
JIM No wonder "Light My Fire's" number one. 
HAIRDRESSER (to JIM) What about you handsome? 
JIM (friendly) The biggest mistakes in my life have been haircuts. 
PAM Don't wash it. Don't set it. He likes it the way it is... 
HAIRDRESSER (backing off) All right, be mean... 
Commotion from the doorway as the PRODUCER leads the lock- jawed MR. SULLIVAN in with everyone bowing and scraping to the Pope. 
PRODUCER Boys -- meet Mr. Sullivan 
Mr. Sullivan waves from the doorway. 
SULLIVAN Hi boys, heard your song "Light That Fire" (Herb corrects) ...think you're great... good luck out there. 
JIM Maybe you're the cause! 
PAM Right. 
JIM I mean I don't have this problem with anybody else. 
PAM (getting the bottle) Give it to me!!! 
JIM (getting it back) No!!!!! Mommy!!! 
PAM (gives up, tries to exit) Fuck you man I'm outta here. 
He grabs her. They lurch, smashing the lamp. WILD CHILD song kicking in. 
JIM (excited now) Get mad! Yeahhh! Love my girl! Yeah, go fuck the other guys. How many white guys have you fucked Pam? 10, 20? Black guys what? You like Chinese dicks? Mongolian penis? 30? 
PAM (fighting) ...how many dogs have you fucked! You don't say No to anybody! Drugs, dogs, uglies, you'd fuck a doorknob with butter on it! 
JIM How could I do that 
PAM (shouting top of her lungs) You're the first one who couldn't make it with me anyway! You're the only limp dick in the lot!!! 
Camera running at them from the end of the room. JIM laughs manically as they roll off the bed into a wall. Kicking, hitting hard. 
DOORS SONG Wild Child full of grace Savior of the human race Your cool face Natural child, terrible child Not your mother or your father's child Your own child, screaming wild 
JIM HA HA HA!! WILL YOU DIE FOR ME! 
PAM NO! WILL YOU DIE FOR ME!! 
JIM I'D DIE FOR ANYBODY. 
PAM WHAT ABOUT ME! WHAT ABOUT ME! 
JIM CUNT CUNT CUNT. 
PAM LIAR LIAR LIAR. YOU PROMISED. YOU PROMISED. 
JIM I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I'M SORRY. 
A VOICE across the wall joining in, banging. 
VOICE SHADDUP WILLYA. I'M TRYING TO SLEEP!!!! 
JIM THEN MOVE TO MIAMI YOU SLAVE!!! 
More nagging. By this time the fight has expired of its own volition. 
JIM (quietly) You were saying? 
They giggle, start to laugh. Then they cuddle on the floor, in the corner, in this semi-lit New York hotel room. 
JIM (low) ...will you die for me, Pam, a clown, a despicable clown?... a mere despicable clown? 
PAM Yes yes yes. 
JIM ...I need a home. A place to hide. 
PAM ...with me. Yes... yes... 
JIM (mumbling) ...how could we make a home?... where there's sanctuary? 
PAM ...yes, yes, yes. 
He's hard now. She's guiding him inside her. 
JIM ...we're in Africa, we're just animals... I wanna stay inside you all night baby... let's fuck death away, now fuck death away... 
PAM ...yes... 
INT. PRESS CONFERENCE - HOTEL SUITE NEW YORK - DAY 
Camera moving in past the buffet, champagne, flowers in the hotel suite overlooking CENTRAL PARK... to the DOORS in armchairs surrounded by an informal group of a DOZEN JOURNALISTS and PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS... JIM behind dark shades drinking long Hawaiian fruit punches, decked out in snakeskin. 
JOURNALIST 1 (stiff, Times type) What are your songs about Mr. Morrison? 
TIME DISSOLVES over the questions and answers. A vaguely dreamy quality. 
JIM Uh love death travel... revolt. We all write the songs, we're interested in anything about disorder, chaos, especially activity which seems to have no meaning... I think when you make peace with authority, you become authority. 
JOURNALIST 1 Can you define that a little more? 
JIM Yeah you can call us erotic politicians I guess. 
DISSOLVING OVER: 
JOURNALIST 2 Do you really consider yourself a shaman Mr. Morrison? 
DISSOLVING OVER: 
JIM ...a scapegoat maybe -- I take on the audiences' fantasies, obeying their impulses. When the impulses are destructive, I'm destructive. It's kinda like sucking the puss out of a rattlesnake, something like that. 
JOURNALIST 1 (smiling) ...like a medicine man or witch doctor? 
RAY (cuts in) Jim said to me once, the history of rock and roll's like Greek drama or caveman stories. The audience comes to see ancient rituals in ancient caves. Their souls in jeopardy. They're not watching any longer, they're participating -- and everything's in play, your life, your death... 
JOURNALIST 1 (glib) Is that why they scream so much? 
Gentle laughter. The JOURNALISTS don't get it... panning their looks. The backbeat of CRYSTAL SHIP, dreamy hazy, Warhol- like interview floating over the room like a giant mushroom cloud. 
JIM Great! A new thing. 
As she goes to a bowl of cocaine, laid alongside a bottle of champagne and a basketful of items all catered by Jim. He's at her bookcase, thumbing through an ancient manuscript. 
JIM Wow how old is this? 
INSERT -- the DRAWINGS in the book pertain to Witchcraft. 
PATRICIA (snorting) 14th Century. I practice the Craft. 
JIM The Craft? 
PATRICIA I'm a witch (smiles) A white one. 
JIM (impressed) Wow! You Patricia? Who would've guessed? 
Ironic of course when you look at her long dark locks and demeanor. She looks back at him, challenging. 
PATRICIA The Kennealy's were Celtic cheiftains and pre-Christian shamans when your Druid ancestors the Morrisons were a minor Scottish clan founded by a bastard son of the king of Norway. 
JIM reappraising her. Her eye contact is very direct. 
PATRICIA It's a religion, witchcraft. Witches are the protectors of the seasons, the harvests, goddesses of the grain. And when crossed, destroyers. 
Jim waits. Something in the feeling of the room has shifted. The sound of her razor chopping coke. He snorts -- the first time. 
PATRICIA You ever try drinking blood? 
JIM What? 
PATRICIA It works you know. You drink blood the right time of the moon... they used to dance in the forests naked. I think that's what offended the Puritans and led to the Burnings. They were a sexual threat to their male order like the Bacchae -- five days a year for Dionysus, they used to wander the hills in ancient Greece, the first witches, clans of wild women fucking, looting, eating animals raw, the wine in their blood running hot -- looking for Dionysus... to tear him to pieces -- isn't that wild? 
Jim is down on his knees crawling around her. She is crawling back. 
JIM (hooked) Where do you get the blood? 
Patricia laughs. 
SUPERIMPOSITION TO: 
PATRICIA drawing blood from her arm -- wipes it on his mouth. Some of it spills out, tamping the white powder with red stains. Jim watching enthralled, coked out. She hands him the jewelled Moroccan dagger. 
PATRICIA Blood is the rose of mysterious union, symbol of potency... now you. 
JIM No... I don't like... cutting myself. 
PATRICIA (stern) Don't be such a child! If I do it, you have to do it. 
He extends his arm. The look between them. He closes his eyes like a little boy. She makes the cut. 
DOORS SONG Before you slip into unconsciousness I'd like to have another kiss Another flashing chance at bliss Another kiss, another kiss 
SUPERIMPOSITIONS: 
Candles, incense burn. As Jim and Patricia dance in the loft naked to music, drinking champagne. 
JUMP CUT: He is chasing her with one of her goat horns between his legs. They wrestle, yell, lusty bacchanale. 
SUPERIMPOSITIONS TO: 
They're fucking madly on the wooden floor of the loft, bathed in blood and white powder all over the place, rain pelting the windows, thunder, Orff's "Carmina Burana" cutting in over the Doors' song. 
PATRICIA (sexy) Come on rock god, fuck me, fuck me good. 
In slightly ape-like SLOW MOTION, he's wildly thrusting at her like a stallion, then reaches down, yanks out her diaphragm -- holds it to her eyes briefly and throws it across the room into the fireplace. 
JIM (lips out of sync) I'm gonna burn you down. 
PATRICIA Come on... 
Incants him to climax with CELTIC WORDS. 
Jim is wild, reaching for the Moroccan dagger, holding it to her face as he continues to pump. 
PATRICIA Cut me! Cut me go on! 
JIM (knife to her cheek) Nobody'd ever look at you again -- 'cept me. I'd scar you forever. 
PATRICIA Yeah YEAH! 
JIM AWRIGHT! AWRIGHT! 
PATRICIA FUCK ME! FUCK ME!! GO ON FUCK ME!!! 
DOORS SONG The crystal ship is being filled A thousand girls, a thousand thrills A million ways to spend your time When we get back I'll drop a line 
The camera shooting up to the ceiling in a tilting dutch angle as the world comes unglued. Jim yelling with release. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO - NEW YORK - ANOTHER DAY 
GLORIA STAVERS, beautiful 30ish ex-Vogue model shooting Jim for her layout. It's not going well. He's resisting, the attitude negative to be photographed, compounded by the acid it seems he's on. 
GLORIA Take off your shirt. 
JIM (cow noise) Mooooooo!!! 
GLORIA (taking his shirt off) You remind me of a Russian peasant. I see you standing in a wheat field. The pride, the arrogance. You love to look at yourself don't you. You love yourself. (he's moving, getting into it) ...good... big cat stalking... 
JIM I like outer space. 
Tom Baker brings a tall, incredible looking BLONDE in black leather towards him. 
TOM Hey where's my joint? (a roach goes back) There's this chick sings with the Velvet Underground, Andy's band. She says she can drink you under the table. 
They stare at each other like two cats. Eye level stares that go on and on. She finally hisses in a German accent. 
NICO I'm Nico. It's boring tonight. Some of us are going downtown to a new club. You want to come? 
A voice to kill, looks to undress, fully as tall as Jim. 
TOM (distantly heard) ...elevate your taste in trolls man. 
JIM (to Nico who reaches for her vodka) Vodka? Race you. 
NICO Your death... 
JIM (to Ray and Robbie) Wanna go?... Come on let's go. 
ROBBIE She looks too freaky to me. 
NICO Wait just a minute. 
As she floats away. 
JIM Come on there's pussy Robbie. 
ROBBIE (excited) Hey I met this chick Lynne, she wants to be alone. 
Lynne is there, pretty, nods to Jim. 
RAY Come on Jim, let's go. 
JIM (childlike) Don't you guys wanna meet Andy Warhol? 
JOHN Tell you the truth, I can live without him. He's a freak. Let's get outta here. We got a show tomorrow. 
JIM Come on man! I thought we were gonna be a band, the four of us -- and party all night, rock and roll! 
RAY (laughs) I could never keep up with you Jim. I couldn't make the music. 
Jim's eyes briefly on -- Pamela giggling with the French Count, putting her hand on his arm as she laughs. Innocent, nothing meant but a moment... 
JIM (desperate mockery, grabs Ray) Don't go. Don't leave! You can't leave. I don't know what will happen. It might be Death. 
RAY Come on Jim, this isn't our scene, these people are vampires. We gotta stick together man, the four of us. Let's make the myths man. 
A moment, strange. Slightly SLOW MOTION. Ray tapping Jim's shoulder goodbye... Robbie and John's faces passing on. As if they're parting -- in a symbolic way. Jim blinking in the same SLOW MOTION, looking. Nico is gone -- but Tom is there, across the room, waving. 
The INDIAN SHAMAN looks like he's standing there in a corner. Jim, ripped, heads for him, but the PR WOMAN cuts him off. Jim forgets he saw the Indian. 
PR MAN Right here Jim, right here. Andy's waiting. You know what you have in common is uniqueness. 
Past more faces. The Music has subtly shifted to STRANGE DAYS somewhere along the way. 
DOORS SONG Strange days have found us Strange days have tracked us down They're going to destroy Our casual joys We shall go on playing or find a new town 
Past a cache of QUEENS in white leather ogling Jim, one of them coming over boldly, chatting him up (AD LIB dimly heard), them grabbing his crotch and kissing him. Jim rearing back, laughing but wary. Past the RICH LADIES dripping with jewels and faces peeled from Brazilian sleep tanks and Swiss knives. 
Past a YOUNG MAN dressed in Jim Morrison leather pants with his hair and eye make-up, a warped image of Jim, smiling back at him. 
JIM (looking for Nico) Nico! 
INT. BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT 
A quieter room, drugged out, the PR GUY cheerily leading JIM, stepping over SLEEPING BODIES, over fur coats strewn across the floor... to a MAN with white hair like a circus clown, his back to us, talking with some black-tied EUROPEAN ARISTOCRATS looking so cool. 
WARHOL Well, it was such a big opening, we just had to go to Philadelphia, y'know, you were supposed to, mmm... 
PR GUY (butting in) Andy! Andy! 
ANDY turning at the interruption. He looks like a chic voodoo doll. Holding an incongruous gold telephone in his arms like a teddy bear. 
Slightly SLOW MO as Warhol's black empty eyes confront Jim -- a pit of nothingness in them, amnesia, death. In Jim's SLOW MOTION reaction we read what he sees. Andy going on with his story, to the group that includes TOM BAKER. 
ANDY ...but so many people showed up, the paintings were getting crushed, so they took them all down... um, it really looked great y'know... maybe uhhh... (long pause) 
PR MAN (cutting in) ...the walls. The blank walls. Andy was the art. Should do a show. Just walls. Today it's really about people, not what they do. It's the astronaut that matters, not the voyage, the actor, not the movie -- how do I say, it's the trip, not arriving. 
Andy is looking at Jim. Jim at Andy. 
PR MAN (babbling on) ...you know what Andy says, some day everybody's gonna be famous for 15 seconds, but it won't mean anything. 
BAKER That's too short. I need a coupla hours. 
They laugh. Andy's eyes hidden, face as white as styrofoam. 
ANDY We'd just love to have you in our movies Jim, you're so beautiful, you'd be so good, you mmmm, here... this is for you Jim. 
Andy shows his eyes, gives Jim the gold telephone he's carrying. 
ANDY Edie gave this to me and said mmmmm, I could talk to God with this. But I don't really have anything to say. So... mmmm now you can talk to God. Oh hi! 
Vanishes, waving to somebody else. Jim holding the phone. 
DOORS SONG Strange days have found us And through their strange hours We linger alone 
Nico reappears waving at him to come quickly. 
Jim shakes his head, weary. Suddenly he's scared inside. 
JIM You're wrong. What they want I can't give... my death -- ripped to pieces -- do you feel their power? (the noise pounding) 
PATRICIA You have no choice, Jim. I see you up there like Icarus. I see you flying closer and closer to the sun. And your wings are melting... 
JIM I want to live, Patricia. I don't wanna die. 
Jim's ironic eyes, to the ceiling. Laden with a power to which he has married himself yet brave, resisting as she pulls his zipper down and goes to her knees in front of him. Shaking his head. 
JIM Patricia... Patricia... 
A beefy COP stands there looking at them, 
COP Whatcha doing there? 
JIM Uh... nuthin' 
COP (approaching, suspicious) Okay, outta there both of you. No one's allowed backstage. Let's go. 
PATRICIA You idiot, don't you know who... 
JIM Hey, I'm with the band man. It's cool. Take it easy. 
THE COP has no patience, grabs JIM by the arm and pulls. JIM shoves him off. THE COP pushes back. A shoving match. 
COP Let's go. NOW! You're both under arrest. 
JIM (pointing to his crotch, angry) Hey, eat it man! 
The cop whips out a black can from his belt, sprays Jim. 
JIM Mace! Shit! (in pain) 
Patricia screaming at the COP grabs JIM, propelling him violently out the stall of the bathroom. 
INT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - SAME NIGHT 
PATRICIA Help! They got Jim!!! 
JIM Why'd you blind me man? You blinded me! 
SIDDONS and RAY running up with ROADIES and OTHERS. 
SIDDONS What the hell happened! (to Jim) Don't touch Jim. Get some water. Don't touch your eyes. 
JIM (in pain) I BEEN BLINDED MAN. I BEEN MACED. 
COP (realizing) Hey all he said was... 
SIDDONS He was WHAT! He's Jim Morrison for chrissake. Jim, Jim -- you okay -- let's get you under the water here. Don't touch, you'll be okay. 
COP 2 comes up. 
COP 1 I'm going to have to issue a warrant for his arrest. 
SIDDONS Are you NUTS! (blocking them) 
JIM guided back into the shower stall by his entourage, eyes blind as Oedipus, starts to laugh. A black Irish laugh. 
Ray looking on PATRICIA in the hallway. A beat, senses what happened. 
RAY Why don't you leave him alone lady, he doesn't need more shit in his life. 
PATRICIA What do you know what Jim needs? 
A precise military Drum Beat hits as we launch into "The Unknown Soldier". 
DOORS SONG ...Hup two -- three -- four... COMPANY HALT! 
INT. NEW HAVEN STAGE - THAT NIGHT 
THE DOORS on stage, JIM - eyes masked, facing death at a mock execution, in full black leather armor. 
DOORS SONG Present arms!... 
The famous drum roll, tension building. Sudden sound of guitar. Jim crumples to the ground. Blood shooting from his mouth. 
JIM & DOORS Make a grave for the unknown soldier Nestled in your hollow shoulder The unknown soldier Practice as the news is read Television children dead Bullet strikes the helmet's head It's all over The war is over! 
The audience is enrapt. Jim suddenly jumps up, looses the blood curdling scream of an aroused demon and the band bangs into Willie Dixon's BACK DOOR MAN. 
JIM & DOORS OH YEEEEAAAAHHHHHHHHHH! AYYYYYYAAAAAMMMMAAA BACK DOOR MAN. 
The FANS go wild, to the farthest reaches of the arena, as he grabs his crotch and shakes it at them. INSTAMATICS flashing rapidly as the KIDS press forward at Jim fondling the mike stand, sliding up and down its smooth shaft. 
JIM & DOORS Well the men don't know But the little girls unnerstan'... 
Joints sail onto the stage at his feet, ready to be smoked. A TEENAGE BOY & GIRL make a break thru the cordon of COPS at the front of the stage, heading for Jim. The Cops chase them down mid-stage, and wrestle them back to the edge -- throwing them back into the audience. 
JIM & DOORS When all the good people are trying to sleep I'm out there making my midnight creep Yeah, cause I'm a backdoor man The men don't know But the little girls unnerstan'... 
Danger fills the air, electric. Jim strutting, Indian like, up to one of the Cops, whipping off his hat and flipping it to the Crowd, which roars with approval. A couple Cops looking at Jim, sensing they're being challenged but not sure how. They shuffle and look offstage for direction. Their apparent impotence brings redoubled jeering from the Kids. 
RAY, next to his stick of incense on the organ, shares a look with JOHN as they head into the instrumental break in the song. There's something different about Jim -- more demonic, more driven -- a spirit has taken him over. 
RAY'S POV -- JIM catching his look, but no recognition in those eyes. They're dark pools, like Warhol's eyes. He turns away, taking the mike and off the cuff rapping improvisationally with the backbeat, keeping poetic meter. 
JIM I wanna tell you 'bout something that happened just a few minutes ago right here in New Haven. This is New Haven isn't it? New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America? 
RAY (aside to Robbie) He could go all the way man! In five years he could be in the White House. Another JFK. 
Robbie's look tells us he thinks Ray is as much caught up in his dreams as Jim. 
CUT TO: 
FLASHBULBS hits us full frame as: 
INT. MUG SHOT - LIMBO 
A reminder of the reality as the thud of a clanking gate shuts. MORRISON's profile, disheveled hair -- he glares angrily. 
FLASH! 
FRONTAL SHOT, slated Police Dept -- New Haven Conn -- 23750 -- 12-10-67. A sullen handsome portrait. 
INT. RECORDING STUDIO - (LAST SESSION) - LOS ANGELES NIGHT 
JIM drinks... an ugly cough. Silence. In this puffy wrack and ruin there is still the ironic tones and sweet delight of the boy amazed and amused by it all. We hear the ghostly CROWD still cheering. 
JIM I drink so I can talk to assholes. This includes me. Let's just say I was testing the bounds of reality -- that's-all -- I was curious... I kinda always preferred to be hated. Like Erich Von Stroheim in the movies... the man you loved to hate... it's meant to be ironic, courage wants to laugh. Y'know it's essentially a stupid situation. I go out on a stage and I howl for people. In me they see what they want to see -- some say the Lizard King, whatever that means, or some black-clad leather demon whatever that means... but really I think of myself as a sensitive, intelligent human being but with the soul of a clown which always forces me to blow it at the most crucial moment... (pause) a fake hero... a joke the gods played on me... it's okay, I accept the joke... and smile. Death old friend, death and my cock, I can forgive my injuries in the name of wisdom, luxury, romance. Words got me the wound and will get me well. All join now in lament of my cock, a tongue of knowledge in the feathered night. Boys get crazy in the head and suffer. I sacrifice my cock on the alter of silence. 
The ENGINEER looking at him puzzled. Has Jim lost it? MIKE, his friend, is there in the Engineer's booth, with the Door's SECRETARY, Leticia, and an elegant MYSTERY WOMAN. They're smoking dope, partying. 
MIKE Hey Jim, how 'bout hitting a strip- joint? It's getting late and we can... 
JIM Nah, later... 
The violent backbeat of THE WASP now picking up. 
JIM Now listen to this I'll tell you about Texas Radio and the big beat soft driven slow and mad like some new language reaching your head with the cold sudden fury of a divine messenger let me tell you about heartache and the loss of God wandering, wandering in hopeless night out here on the perimeter there are no stars out here we is stoned, immaculate... but I tell you this: No eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn. 
EXT. LOS ANGELES - DAWN (1968) 
JIM walks the dawn streets. Classic image -- jeans, boots, jacket, the sun starting to rise on the smog and translucent pink light along Santa Monica Boulevard outside the cheap Alta Cienega Motel where he lives... PEACE FROG shoots us through. 
DOORS SONG Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven Blood stains the roofs and palm trees of Venice Blood in my love in the terrible summer The bloody red sun of phantastic L.A. 
Over the SONG, a MONTAGE of the 60's passing to its darker side. 
DOCUMENTARY IMAGES 
MARTIN LUTHER KING assassinated, BOBBY KENNEDY gunned down, PEGGY FLEMMING ice skating at the Olympics; A QUAKER burns himself to death protesting the war in Vietnam; B-52 bombs dropped on CAMBODIA; KENT STATE erupts; CHARLES MANSON is arrested. 
INT. BARNEY'S BEANERY - LOS ANGELES - MONDAY 
JIM -- drinking in Barney's Bar. 
HEADLINE READS: 
"KANSAS COPS SLAM DOORS; CONCERT CANCELLED," 2nd HEADLINE: "DOORS 3RD ALBUM OUT, SALES UP, MAGIC DOWN." 
Dissolve to CRITIC'S FACE. Back to Jim's face. Superimpositions over it of: 
NEWS FLASHES 
LYNDON JOHNSON's dog face on TV withdrawing: NIXON waving as he wins '68; Rowen and Martin's LAUGH IN; COLUMBIA STUDENTS taking over; 3rd HEADLINE: "MORRISON BUSTED IN VEGAS". MARTIN LUTHER KING going down again; NIXON winning; massive ANTI- WAR PROTESTS in Washington; floating space ships in "2001"; B-52s sailing over Vietnam 4th HEADLINE: "DOORS PROVOKE CHICAGO RIOTS" -- again and again, faster, faster. 
DOORS SONG Blood is the rose of mysterious union! There's blood in the streets & it's up to my knees She came Blood in the streets of Chicago She came Blood on the rise and it's following me Just about the break of day (etc) The river runs red down the legs of the city She came The women are crying red rivers of weeping 
The MONTAGE collides into an ECU on JIM -- drinking as if to silence the images, the sounds we hear and see on his face. Spirits crying for release. In alcoholic solace. He passes out, head hitting the bar. 
Jim's English friend, MIKE, walks in, throwing a harsh shaft of LA morning light across the dark bar and JIM's face, bleary eyed, passed out on the counter. He has a drinking paunch. With him are TOM BAKER, "TOM", the actor from the Warhol scene in New York and a huge biker type drinker named DOG, one of Jim's roadmen, a beard fanning his chest, tattoos everywhere. In the front of these three monoliths are about twenty beer bottles, numerous Jack Daniels bottles emptied and a lesbian BARTENDRESS pouring up a breakfast shot of bloody Marys... Mike hands Dog a breakfast in a brown paper bag. 
MIKE Morning. Pour me breakfast Delores... 
Delores pouring the bloody mary. As Mike scoffs at Jim passed out. 
MIKE Whatsa matter with Jimbo? Can't handle it huh (studying the beer bottles for leftovers) 
TOM Pussy whipped, man... 
DOG reaching in, dragging Jim's face up by the hair. Sticks Mike's greasy eggs and bacon in front of Jim. 
DOG Hey Jim, come on babe, eat this. . . one last place to go. Ray's getting it on. 
Jim is suddenly alert -- an instant and surprising transformation, without hangover, eager eyed. 
JIM (sparkling) Alive she cried! Right Dog, another cubic centimeter of chance (slaps Dog, notices the eggs, queasy) Ugh, I can't eat this stuff, it'll really make me sick. Gimme a Dos Equis will ya Delores? And a Ramos gin fizz with it. 
TOM Fuck man did you fade or what, we were on a "death run" up to the 9000 building after the gig, you bet me a grand you'd walk the ledge. 
JIM (instantly) Let's go... Right now! 
TOM Then mumbling about "gotta go home, sanctuary," pussy whipped. We were gonna film it! A thousand bucks! (to Delores) Give him a double. 
JIM A triple, Tom, shem and shaun... 
TOM ...imagine me and Morrison in a fuckin movie together, can you imagine two powerful two-fisted Irish fucking drinking guys in a movie, in a documentary movie!! 
MIKE I'll direct the shit out of it, man. Dennis Hopper can do it, I can do it. 
JIM (drinking the fizz down) ...all of us direct it! In black and white. Call it "Zero." A real road movie! Two of these (points to drink) you feel a lot better. 
As he pisses on the floor next to the bar stool. 
DOG Whatcha doing! Oh fuck. 
DELORES Fuck you Morrison. You're outta here you fuckhead, get out! 
PAM And you're gonna change those stinky leathers you been wearing for three weeks. 
JIM I don't know 'bout that. 
PAM What the hell are you on? 
JIM Uh -- just some low grade acid. It's not heavy. (whispers) Pam, read my mind. 
PAM Jesus Jim! Goddamit! You PROMISED. I made the duck! People are coming! Ray and Dorothy think we're flaky enough and I... you said you'd wait till after, you're going to peak before me. 
JIM Hey it's okay, it's okay... come on, we'll trip and then eat our feast. 
PAM Yeah sure. 
Putting down the bags at their porch, pausing. He moves to her, kisses her, conciliatory and gentle. 
JIM Come on baby, y'know it's a good thing for Ray and Dorothy I think women are such noble creatures -- they carry on your name with dignity after you die. (spawning like minnows) 
PAM What are you saying? You wanna marry me Jim? 
JIM (elusively) I think women basically have a comic approach to life -- I mean how can they not when they look up in the dark and see a dangling penis, seeking entry. It looks like a face y'know -- little beard "Hi mom" (Pam giggling now) I wanna get inside you. Look around. (humming) "Do the funky chicken, do dah, dah, funky chicken do da da "love my girl" -- 
She's cracking up now. As he takes the acid out, holds it in front of her like a sacrament. 
JIM Let's go wild child, let's get out there Romeo and Juliet, Marilyn Monroe and Vincent Van Gogh, Jim and Pam, rock and roll (a poem) ...all the poetry has wolves in it, but one Pam -- the most beautiful one of all -- dances in a ring of fire and throws off the challenge with a shrug 
As she takes the tablet on her tongue, swallows. 
PAM (romantic) I like it when you sing to me 
JIM 'cause I'm the poet and you're my muse 
Strains of YOU'RE LOST, LITTLE GIRL drift in, setting a more ominous tone. 
INT. JIM AND PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - THAT DAY 
The FOOD is laid out, the DUCK cooking... but no one is there as we move across this tastefully decorated house to PAMELA in the living room, rattled, obsessively going through Jim's papers. PEOPLE are knocking at the door. Guests looking through the windows, tapping. A giant poster of Marilyn Monroe frames Pamela. 
PAM What am I going to do about these papers! Jim, Jim -- you really need someone to organize this stuff. Your handwriting's just like a little kid. 
Jim is somewhere else -- pulling out the DUCK which is totally charred black. He laughs. 
PAM My God look at this. I wonder if William Blake was ever this disorganized. 
RAY and DOROTHY walking in. ROBBIE and JOHN general commotion. Dorothy immediately seeing the duck, runs to it... 
DOROTHY Oh the duck! 
JIM (coming over) Get some drinks, man. Over there (getting Pam's attention) Pam! 
PAM I'm gonna be your editor now, seriously I'm going to organize all your stuff. I'm gonna take out all the fuck words. 
DOORS SONG You're lost little girl You're lost little girl You're lost, tell me Who are you? 
PEOPLE are introducing themselves, coming in from all over, like in a shoebox. Hippies. Doors people... now TOM BAKER with MIKE and DOG... Now an aggressive Chuck Berry type BLACK SINGER with John's GIRLFRIEND. Then a TIMOTHY LEARY look- alike appears. CHATTER blending everywhere as we build to a vast confusion at Jim and Pam's party. 
JIM Let's go wild child, let's get out there Romeo and Juliet, Marilyn Monroe and Vincent Van Gogh, Jim and Pam, rock and roll (a poem) "Clothed in sunlight Restless in wanting Dying of fever Changed shapes of an empire Vast promissory notes of joy How it has changed you How slowly estranged you Solely arranged you Beg you for mercy" 
As she takes the tablet on her tongue, swallows. 
JIM (cupping her chin) Pam... Honey, you're trying too hard. 
PAM I'm not -- I'm not. 
JIM (soft, reassuring) Yes you are. 
PAM There's some great poetry here Jim, some wonderful ideas. 
JIM Yeah but nobody wants to read poetry anymore, nobody cares, it's not like important y'know. Just put it away. Not right now. 
PAM (lost) But what am I supposed to do? How do I fit in? Who am I supposed to be around all these people? 
The FRENCH COUNT coming in now, from the Warhol party in New York. They're looking at her, embarrassing as everyone overhears. 
COUNT Darling Pamela, I brought you a little something. 
JIM (ignoring it) You're my girl, that's who... 
PAMELA (laughs insanely) I'm not your girl, don't give me that shit. I know you fuck everything that touches you. 
Only in life would ANNE O'RIORDAN walk in at this precise moment, a smile on her face. Ray's eyes roll. 
ANNE Hi Jim... (waiting for the introduction to Pam) 
JIM (to Pamela) All right so I do. I live my life the way I want. I don't want anyone expecting anything from me -- including you! You don't like it then get the fuck out! (to Anne) Oh hi Anne. You know Pam? She's a little pissed off right now but... 
RAY Okay Jim let's eat that duck. 
DOROTHY (calming Pamela) Come on Pam, let's put out the plates... 
PAMELA (stunned, pushing thru to Anne) Anne O'Riordan. Are you Anne O'Riordan? 
ANNE You must be Pamela 
PAMELA (eyeing her up and down through her tears) You actually put your dick in this woman Jim? 
JIM Well I... sometimes yeah 
PAMELA (condescending to Anne) I understand... I really do but don't ever think that Jim's gonna love you or take care of you. You're one of a hundred you know 
Exiting with the other Doors... Dog picking the duck up from the floor. 
DOG Hey, fuck him, let's eat this thing. 
Pamela is sobbing, in a quiet bewildered voice, repeating to herself. 
PAM What the hell's happened to us Jim? What the hell is happening to us. There's some great poetry... 
On Jim... saddened. 
DOORS SONG You're lost little girl (2) You're lost, tell me Who are you? 
INT. TUNNEL - OUTDOOR THEATRE - NIGHT 
The backbeat of NOT TO TOUCH THE EARTH as a DOCUMENTARY FILM CREW, moves past us directed by MIKE and DOG and TOM shoot past us, sun guns, nagras ("Rolling! Speed!") then... 
A mad rush of HANDS and SCREAMS as SHAPES whip by under swinging light-bulbs -- big BLACK BODYGUARDS, six or seven of them, bulling their way thru the grasping faces, as MORRISON appears... camera swinging wildly with him to reveal: 
EXT. ARENA - (ANY CITY) - NIGHT 
THOUSANDS OF FANS roaring "DOORS! DOORS! DOORS!" 
VOICE (loudspeaker) Ladies and Gentlemen, from Los Angeles California -- The DOORS! 
SIDDONS (in crush) Jim! Your Mom's here with your brother. What do you want me to do with 'em? 
JIM (shakes his head) HIDE ME!!! 
HARD CUT TO: 
Madness. COPS lining the edge of the stage, looking worried. As Jim throws his leather jacket into the cheering crowd and does the ghost dance around the microphone, Indian style, one foot, resurrecting the dead, the power of the circle. The stage is bottom lit, Dantean in look. The Doors casting giant shadows of heroic proportions. DEA AGENTS in suits and short hair take photos from the front of the stage, clipboards in hand. Blocked by a row of cops, it is impossible for Jim to communicate with his audience. 
JIM & DOORS There's been a slaughter here Don't stop to speak or look around Your gloves and fan are on the ground We're getting out of town we're going on the run And you're the one I want to come Not to touch the earth Not to see the sun Nothing left to do But run, run, run Let's run, let's run... 
SIDDONS yelling at MIKE, the roadie. 
SIDDONS Vice Squad says one more "fuck or shit" they're gonna close us down man. 
MIKE Stick my dick in their ear! 
Jim ignoring all this, one hand cupped to his ear listening for the sound of the earth, gone into a shaman-like state, weird spiralling chords carrying over the following MONTAGE of hallucinatory insanity. 
JIM & DOORS House upon the hill Moon is lying still... 
EXT. JIM & PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT 
A POV up at the house -- into which JIM enters. The lights are on. Sage at the door sniffing. 
INT. JIM & PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT 
JIM & DOORS Shadows of the trees witnessing the wild breeze Come on baby run with me Run with me, let's run... 
JIM'S POV entering the bedroom -- PAMELA naked in bed with the COUNT, is snorting heroin. Shadows of the trees and leaves blowing against the walls. Their voices, dim, distant. 
JIM (ironic) Oh hi... I didn't realize you were entertaining. 
PAM (stoned) Hi. 
She sits up on the bed, wobbly. The COUNT, more sophisticated in these things, lights a cigarette from the bedside table, revealing heroin paraphernalia. 
COUNT Scusi Jimmy, I hope you're cool about this... 
JIM (very cool) Don't forget your smack on the way out. 
EXT. ARENA - CONCERT 
Jim's struggling to break through the barrier of cops. 
JIM (yelling) The mansion is warm at the top of the hill Rich are the rooms and the comforts there Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs You won't know a thing till you get inside 
BACK TO: 
INT. JIM & PAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The COUNT is gone. JIM, icy cold, grabs PAM by the wrist. 
JIM I told you about that shit. Or are we talking about death choices here? 
PAM I'm just doing my thing, just like you said, it's my thing, why can't I have a thing. Ow! You're hurting me! 
JIM (rising anger) Get up. Hurt? You want to know HURT? Let me introduce you to my good friend hurt. 
He is on her, throws her from the bed. She runs and hides in the closet, slamming the door behind her. 
PAM (screaming) NO FUCK YOU! THIS IS MY... 
JIM (crazed) Ah sanctuary!... a soft place to hide. 
PAM (inside) ...from you, you pig! 
As he picks up a can of lighter fluid and douses the closet door and the floor. 
JIM I'll give you a place to hide forever! 
We INTERCUT with PAM inside the closet yelling for mercy inside. 
PAM JIM! 
He puts a candle to the drenched door/floor. 
EXT. ALTA CIENEGA MOTEL ROOM - SAME DAY 
PAM's mascara is running from her eyes, begging to get in. The BLACK MAID cleaning the adjacent room overheard, unsurprised. 
PAM Jim, I gotta talk! Let me in please. I gotta talk. 
JIM Now Pam sweetheart, I'm busy. 
Pamela listening at the door. She's on the second story of a cheap motel overlooking a boring parking lot on the edge of La Cienega. 
PAM Jim, I know there's someone in there, I can't believe you're doing this again. You're disgusting. 
INTERCUTS TO: 
INT. MOTEL ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 
JIM Well you see Pam there's this crazy girl in here, she's just lying on the bed with her legs open and I don't know what to do. 
PAM FUCK YOU!!! I want to see her. 
JIM (off) It's your cousin Lizzie, you don't want to see her. Go home. 
PAM We're all sisters, let me see her. Jim,... I got this wonderful leg of lamb in the oven for supper... and the house is immaculate. Sage is waiting. He wants you to play with him... are you coming... 
JIM Almost. 
PAM Jim goddamit answer me!! (no answer, she yells) JIM! I FUCKED HIM TO HURT YOU! HE DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO ME!! 
PEOPLE in the parking lot looking up. A silence is her only response. She waits, turns away from the closed door as TOUCH ME BABE cuts in: 
DOORS SONG C'mon, c'mon, c'mon c'mon now Touch me babe Can't you see that I am not afraid 
INT. RECORDING STUDIO - THAT NIGHT 
In the VOCAL BOOTH, JIM is chugging on a brown paper bag with whiskey in it, crooning with heart but the voice is warped, weak. 
JIM What was that promise you made Why don't you tell me what she said What was that promise that she made I'm gonna love you Till the heaven stops the rain I'm gonna love you Till the stars fall from the sky For you and I... 
VARIOUS PEOPLE are hanging around the studio listening -- a couple of HIPPIE CHICKS, A BURN VICTIM w/ bandages, a CHARLES MANSON TYPE, a Siberian HUSKY, the TIM LEARY type. Paper bags, burgers, bottles, California rose, apple juice, hard- boiled eggs. 
In the ENGINEERING BOOTH. ROTHCHILD, the producer, is displeased. 
PAUL (to Botnick the engineer) ...fuckin' neanderthal primadonna is too drunk to see. (cuts the music, to Jim) Cut it... that was beautiful sweetheat, we had a technical problem, we'll take it again from the top babe whenever you're ready. 
On the floor, the DOORS are depressed. DENSMORE looking at MORRISON, aimlessly, nervously. KRIEGER looking tired and beaten, takes a discreet hit on a joint. Ray scans an art book, patient. 
DENSMORE What's his fucking problem? 
JIM (equally false) Paul babe. 
PAUL Right here baby. 
JIM Why don't you suck a fart out of my asshole you slave driving facist motherfucker! 
As he stalks out of the booth. Raging, near-incomprehensible. 
A small portable TV set is playing the "Dean Martin Show" low on one end of the recording console. Around the room the detritus of the time -- Mailer's "Armies of the Night", The Stone's "Beggar's Banquet", Janis' "Cheap Thrills", Traffic, The Band. 
PAUL (exasperated) I hear the booze, I hear the smokes Jim, I don't hear the voice and babe I didn't hear the song! 
JIM So what are we going to tonight Paul! 67 takes! It's stale! 
RAY (coming in with JOHN) Alright, let's try something else. 
JIM I wanna sing blues. This stuffs getting too self-conscious. 
ROBBIE (offended) Cause it's my song man? 
JIM (simultaneous, incomprehensible) Let's sing "Rock is Dead"! You're all a buncha slaves... "Oh come all ye faithful." 
PAUL (hot) Shut up Jim! I don't understand! I don't. What are ya doing! I love you like a brother, I do, but why are you fucking this up. It's a perfect radio song for chrissake! No one wants to hear the blues anymore! Think like a singer, you're the only baritone crooner we got left... Sinatra, Elvis, Crosby, you're as good as they are, but WHY ARE YOU FUCKING THIS UP! WHY! 
Pause. Jim's face darkening. Something he sees on the television. He stops, frozen, sickly. Several BIMBETTES are dancing around a shiny new automobile as strains of LIGHT MY FIRE pop out. 
JIM Catchy, you sold it to a commercial? 
Ray, Siddons, Robbie, John, shuffling for a moment. 
JIM For that? How much did you get for it? 
RAY Now, Jim... 
JIM HOW MUCH? 
SIDDONS It was $50,000. You weren't talking to us that week and we figgered you... 
JIM You figured? What the fuck is this Ray? 
RAY It's not like a big deal Jim, the song's already been commercialized, the money was great. Robbie wrote the lyrics and he didn't mind, neither did I, neither did John... we gotta get to TV. 
JIM What?... are you saying? Are we the Doors? One for all and all for one? Do you know what you're saying to those millions of kids! "Just kidding, not real". That's what you're saying. 
JOHN Oh come on man, you think just cause you're the lead man in the band you can run the whole show. 
JIM (building intensity) You think I was kidding Ray? (turning to John) Hey John, those are interesting shoes, you like those shoes? 
PAMELA, looking drawn and pathetic finds this moment to walk into the studio. 
JOHN (aggressive) Yeah I do. 
INT. MIAMI AUDITORIUM - NIGHT (1969) 
Crammed into every available space of an old SEAPLANE HANGAR with no seats -- standing room only -- a MASS of KIDS swelter in the heat, grumbling, fanning themselves with programs as a warm-up BAND plays. 
In the wings of the stage, a RADIO DJ/CRITIC is recording on tape. It's the same kid we saw long ago at the Whiskey backstage, pronouncing the arrival of the Doors on the scene. Now he's got a beard, glasses, a more cynical face. 
RADIO DJ/CRITIC (into microphone) A hot night in Miami January '69 -- every space in the auditorium is consumed... unfortunately the Doors have long since sold out. They've become an act. Morrison "falls" off the stage at least every other performance. "The Soft Parade" album only confirms the plasticity of their approach. Songs like "Touch Me" and "Follow Me Down" are not the Doors we once knew. So the question is: Why am I here? Are funerals entertainment? 
DENSMORE looks on from the stage wings, withdraws -- to RAY nearby. 
DENSMORE He ain't gonna show! I know it man. We should fuckin' go on without him. 
RAY Bill's with him. They're an hour away, he'll get him here. 
INT. NEW ORLEANS AIRPORT BAR - SAME NIGHT 
SIDDONS, the manager tugs on MORRISON who's getting soused with DOG, TOM, MIKE, and ROTHCHILD the producer. The P.A. SYSTEM announcing the departure of the Miami flight! 
SIDDONS Goddamit Jim! We missed one already, we gotta get this one man! 
Jim slams has shot glass on the bar. He's got a beard for the first time, looking like a tribal elder. 
JIM More! 
MIKE Four more all around and up and down! 
As the WAITRESS takes the order 
SIDDONS (urgent) NO! CUT EM OFF! CUT EM OFF! 
JIM Don't be so melodramatic Bill, it's not fun anymore. 
DOG I can't fly sober. 
SIDDONS Jim, you don't show for this one, we're dead, the whole group -- no more bookings. 
JIM I care. 
PAUL Come on Jim, we'll get fuckin' laid in Miami. 
SIDDONS We need the work Jim! They're making us post a $10,000 bond just to show up -- we're the only group in rock-n- roll with a fuck clause! (aside to Dog) Get him on the fuckin' plane. That's what I pay you for. 
DOG (to Bill) You're an awful little guy to be talking like that. 
JIM (muttering) Chump change, we're working for chump change. 
SIDDONS Look at you, you're a pathetic fuckin' slob and so are all your friends! 
JIM I got an idea Bill, you're fired. 
INTERCUT TO: 
INT. MIAMI AUDITORIUM - THAT NIGHT 
The warm-up BAND is applauded and booed. The CROWD resembles a pit of snakes, wriggling on top of each other. Impatient CATCALLS. 
INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
JOHN Listen to 'em! They're not coming for the music anymore. They're coming to see a fuckin' freak show! 
RAY You think it's easy for him. He moves left he's got vice squad, on the right narcs -- and the audience just waiting for him to get busted. 
JOHN He wanted it! Not us. I just don't fuckin' get the point anymore. I never did I guess. Y'ask me he's just become a drunken fuckin' asshole that's what. And he's gonna take us down with him. 
RAY Compassion was never your forte man. 
JOHN Don't lecture me Mr. Philosopher, you never felt a fuckin thing in your life. I loved that man. I loved what he was. 
Robbie strums his guitar, breaks the tension in the room. A lick of "Five to One". 
ROBBIE It ain't the old Jim that's for sure. I think he's living for everybody else man and somewhere along the way he's lost his own self. 
RAY (almost to himself) The wine man, the ancient wine. The ancient wine. 
ROBBIE What? 
RAY Something he once told us. About Dionysos. When the madness took over... 
INTERCUT TO: 
OMIT 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
INT. AIRPLANE - THAT NIGHT 
The STEWARDESS, uptight, tries a smile at JIM, TOM, MIKE all belted in one row. 
STEWARDESS My name is Rita Hager and if... 
JIM If your name is Rita, then yor ol man must be ol man Rita!! (guffaws) 
TOM, MIKE & DOG (chorusing) That ol man Riva, he just keep rolling along! 
STEWARDESS Excuse me sir, my father is not my old man. 
A BABY, with her MOTHER, stares at Jim fascinated. He lifts his dark glasses, winks back at her. 
TIMECUT TO: 
INT. PLANE - SAME NIGHT 
PILOT escorting FOUR FBI AGENTS aboard. 
CAPTAIN As captain of this ship I'm placing all four of you under arrest. The FBI will... 
MIKE For what! What'd we do! 
TOM Read me my rights, motherfuckers... motherfuckin bulls! 
JIM stunned in his drunkenness. SIDDONS and ROTHCHILD protesting AD LIBS. 
INT. MIAMI AUDITORIUM - THAT NIGHT 
The CROWD is heckling a long-haired HIPPIE in a leather hat who cradles a live, snow-white LAMB telling him to "GET OFF", screaming AD LIB for the "DOORS, DOORS, DOORS!! JIM JIM JIM!!" 
HIPPIE Look at this thing! Look at this beautiful little living thing!! How can you eat it!! How can you eat its flesh??? 
CATCALLS. Angry fists pound the edge of the proscenium. Bodies push and pack against each other. If Hieronymus Bosch had painted a rock concert, this would be it. 
HIPPIE LOVE ANIMALS, DON'T EAT THEM!!!! (Boos!!) 
INT. BACKSTAGE - THAT NIGHT 
Excitement. EVERYBODY moving fast... 
...as JIM, dark sunglasses and beard, surrounded by TWO FBI AGENTS and his BODYGUARDS move toward the stage, two hours late. SIDDONS with him arguing AD LIB with RAY and the PROMOTER, a southern sleazeball with long muttonchops and velvet shirt and beads. A mess -- the CROWD chanting DOORS! DOORS! DOORS! DOORS! 
SIDDONS (screaming at promoter) What the FUCK happened to the SEATS!! (grabs him) What's the FUCKING IDEA man! THERE'S NO SEATS! 
PROMOTER I took 'em out! What's wrong with that! We stuffed an extra five thou in there. (pissed at Jim) Where the fuck you been! 
SIDDONS That wasn't THE FUCKING IDEA MAN!! We're gonna sue you!... We're pulling the plug. 
PROMOTER So sue me! You're playing or you ain't leaving here with your equipment sonny! 
SIDDONS (to Ray) We're not playing. 
Meanwhile, JOHN arguing with RAY and JIM who sways, drunk. The FBI agents get lost in the background. 
JOHN I'm not going out there man! 
RAY JOHN, C'MON!! 
JOHN Look at him! I'm not going out there 'till I get some sorta guarantee he's gonna stay in line. I've had it with this shit. 
JIM Whatsa matter, scared Johnny boy? 
JOHN (going physically for Jim) YOU'RE A FUCKIN ASSHOLE MAN!! 
RAY JOHN!! STOP IT!! COME ON!! 
Jim laughing, throws his arm around ROBBIE for support, ROBBIE patient with him. John yelling as they approach the curtains and the lights and the first monster realization of the THOUSAND MOUTHS waiting in the pit of hell. 
JOHN You're pushing death Morrison. Everybody thinks we're drug addicts cause of you Morrison. 
JIM We the Beatles yet? 
JOHN (held by Ray) We took drugs to EXPAND MINDS ASSHOLE, not ESCAPE. I'M NOT GOING OUT THERE WITH YOU. 
JIM Hey John y'ever eaten human flesh? When we get to New York, I know this chick... 
RAY (taking John aside) Come on man. 
JOHN I'm not going out there! 
RAY We'll talk tomorrow, we'll settle it. Just do it tonight man and... 
As JIM brings up a tiny vial with a lubricating head on it, holds it to Robbie's lips playfully. They're in the shadows. 
JIM ...just a touch Robbie, it's the funkiest stuff, you'll play like an orgasm tonight... 
ROBBIE No man come on, I don't want any. 
JIM ...just a little lick, come on trust me... for old times, the four of us, let's get together one more time,... the Doors man... Please. For me. 
Something so sincere in Jim's eyes. Robbie takes the fatal lick. Jim smiles manically as the NUREMBERG SOUNDS of the CROWD drown them out. 
ROBBIE You said you love pain man, but you run from it every chance you get. 
INT. STAGE - SAME NIGHT 
The DOORS come out finally. The noise is overwhelming. Acid, light, noise. Wagnerian Gods, Hitler... 
JIM spreading his arms like Icarus set to fly. The ROARS redouble, their FEET stomping out: 
CROWD (insane) DOORS DOORS DOORS DOORS... 
Joints are thrown by the dozen on the stage at Jim's feet. He is a god now as he bends regally, picks one up. 
COPS everywhere looking as... 
He lights it. The CROWD going nuts as the DOORS go into the ominous introductory strains of FIVE TO ONE trying to get the onus off Jim and the show on the road. The Audience knows the song, go into a primal FOOT STOMP with it. Bras are thrown on stage. Kids writhe madly in the primal Doors dance. 
People with SPARKLERS running through the hangar. CAMERA FLASHBULBS popping throughout the show... get Jim on film while you can. 
Jim, drunk, high, smoking the jay, won't go into the lyrics right off, forcing the Doors to circle the beat again. He jerks his hand back from the mike as if it were a hot wire. 
JIM ARE YOU READY!!!! (beat) ARE YOU REAAAAAAADYYYYYYYYY!! 
He looks like he's really gonna tear it all off now. A flash of boxer shorts. RAY moving. SIDDONS moving. DOG getting to him first, wrapping him in a bearhug from behind, lifting him holding his pants up. 
VINCE THE ROADIE DON'T DO IT MAN. DON'T DO IT! 
RAY HEY JIM. 
JIM C'MON! C'MON! NO LIMITS, NO LAWS! NO LIMITS, NO LAWS! NO LIMITS, NO LAWS! 
The place is in PANDEMONIUM now. GIRLS jumping on stage and dancing with Jim still in Vince the Roadie's bearhug. Another RIOT... COPS fighting the TEENAGERS off the stage, now wobbling under the weight. 
PROMOTER (pissed, head bandaged) GET OFF THE FUCKING STAGE! GET OFF THE FUCKING STAGE!! (stiffarms Jim off the stage) 
RAY starts playing BREAK ON THROUGH trying to keep things normal. 
JIM now out there in the arena in a CONGA LINE, doing his rain dance, hands on hips, the TEENAGERS forming a long snake behind him. 
The huge speaker columns teeter and fall. A corner of the STAGE now COLLAPSES from the weight, PEOPLE spilling on the floor, screams. The power console tips over next to DENSMORE. He bails. Manzarek and Krieger follow. 
The PROMOTER is yelling at SIDDONS about his insurance contract as the COPS and FBI AGENTS close in, looking for Jim. 
COPS Where's the guy with the penis! 
Who is out there leading his naked drunken FLOCK, hundreds of them in a phallic Pied Piper dance thru the darkened seaplane hanger. From BREAK ON THROUGH PART TWO: 
JIM ET AL & DOORS You know the day destroys the night Night divides the day Try to run, try to hide BREAK ON THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE BREAK ON THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE BREAK ON THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE Dead cats! Dead rats! Did you see what they were at Dead cat in a top hat! Sucking on a young man's blood Fat cat in a top hat Thinks he's an aristocrat Thinks he can kill and slaughter Thinks he can shoot my daughter Dead cats! Dead rats! Think you're an aristocrat Crap, that's crap 
Ray watching from the corner of the stage, littered with bras, bottles, shirts, shoes, socks, panties, hats, broken equipment, debris -- the end of the dream. The Doors as a live band are dead. 
DISSOLVING TO: 
INT. MIAMI COURTROOM - DAY (1970) 
The "Charges" are being read by the JUDGE, distant, not of this world. The court is lit in southern gothic daylight, ghostly chiaroscuro, all colors bled. Camera moving along the sweaty white faces of the six older JURORS, all of them straight "silent majority"... past the PROSECUTOR, his shadow cutting the jury box... onto JIM bearded, smoking 2 packs a day, a deep racking cough, sitting with his elder ATTORNEY... RAY, ROBBIE, JOHN, PAMELA, OTHERS in support are there in background. The trial is going down like a morphine dream, Jim featured in diopter close-up. 
JUDGE VOICE ...you are charged under four counts with lewd behavior, simulated masturbation, public drunkenness, profanity, and public exposure. 
A blues riff goes by -- brief, ghostly from RUNNING BLUE. 
JIM SONG Poor Otis dead and gone Left me here to sing his song Pretty little girl with the red dress on Poor Otis dead and gone 
JIM (V.O.) I can't believe this is happening I can't believe all these people are sniffing each other & backing away, teeth grinning, hair raised, growling, here in the slaughtered wind This is it No more fun the death of all joy has come 
The PRESS SECTION is full as Jim's older LAWYER argues in front of the JURY, a distant voice. 
LAWYER Your Honor, I would like to bring to the Court's attention the contemporary Broadway musical "Hair" in which cast members disrobe and appear naked on the stage. 
JUDGE (pounds his gavel) Inadmissable evidence. 
JIM VOICE OVER I had a vision of America Seen from the air 28,000 ft. & going fast A one-armed man in a Texas parking labyrinth A burnt tree like a giant primeval bird in an empty lot in Fresno 
SUPERIMPOSITION: 
LAWYER Your Honor... any difference from the Miami nightclubs where comedians frequently incorporate profanity into their acts 
JUDGE (gavel) Inadmissable evidence. 
JIM VOICE OVER Miles & miles of hotel corridors & elevators, filled with citizens Motel Money Murder, Madness Change the mood from glad to sadness Play the ghost song baby 
The backbeat of WHEN THE MUSIC'S OVER starts, into its spiralling descent. 
SUPERIMPOSITION: 
LAWYER (distant) ...there has not been one shred of evidence: 300 photographs and not one shows a thing; not reliable testimony, nothing but hysterical heresay 
The PRESS is bored, their numbers reduced. The spectators have changed from kids to OLDER PEOPLE intent on preserving their way of life. A TAPE is playing of Jim's devil voice at the concert, cursing: "Come on up here. No limits! No laws", etc... (screams, obscenity) 
JIM & DOORS (SONG) When the music's over (3) Turn out the lights (3) For the music is your special friend Dance on fire as it intends Music is your only friend Until the end (2) 
SUPERIMPOSITION TO: 
LAWYER ...this is a major First Amendment violation by the Police and Politicians of Miami. Every witness they've brought has admitted under oath to not actually seeing the client's genitals -- except one who... 
The PRESS section is now down to about THREE bored FACES, one of them PATRICIA KENNEALY who looks pregnant. 
JIM smiles at her. 
JIM & DOORS Cancel my subscription to the Resurrection Send my credentials to the house of detention I got some friends inside 
EXT. ORANGE BOWL - MIAMI - DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE (DAY) 
ANITA BRYANT & JACKIE GLEASON at the NATIONAL DECENCY RALLY. A large CROWD in the vicinity of 100,000. NIXON addressing them. 
JIM & DOORS SONG (OVER) The face in the mirror won't stop The girl in the window won't stop A feast of friends alive she cried Waiting for me Outside! 
MONTAGE -- NEWSPAPER HEADLINES SPIN OUT:

A ROLLING STONE WANTED POSTER ON JIM -- "In the County of Dade/Dead -- Did He Or Didn't He?". 
JIM & DOORS SONG (OVER) Before I sink into the big sleep I want to hear The scream of the butterfly Come back baby Back into my arms 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - MIAMI BEACH - DAY 
The MUSIC continuing into a long backbeat without lyrics -- emphasizing the downward spiralling theme... 
JIM ...Well, you gonna get rid of it? Fucked up people y'know, crazies, unwanted Indians just throw it in the river.

AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY 
Written by 
Tracy Letts 
1   AN ENDLESS SKY AT TWILIGHT                                  1 
Foreboding. Heat lightning in the distance. Miles of unforgiving, summer-scorched prairie. 
BEVERLY (OS) ..."Life is very long..." 
2   MILES OF STRAIGHT ROAD                                      2 
Two lanes, not a car in sight. Cracked asphalt undulates over gentle, browned hills, disappears into an infinite horizon. 
BEVERLY (OS) TS Eliot. Not the first person to say it, certainly not the first person to think it. 
3   A LAKE IN THE GATHERING DUSK                                3 
Flat, still. An empty aluminum rowboat lolls listlessly, tied haphazardly to an old wooden dock. 
BEVERLY (OS) But he's given credit for it because he bothered to write it down. 
4   AN OLD FARM HOUSE SITTING ATOP A LOW HILL                   4 
At the end of a long gravel road.   Surrounded by towering black walnuts and lace-bark elms.   A farm once, no one's put a plow to earth here in decades. 
BEVERLY (OS) So if you say it, you have to say his name after it. "Life is very long:" TS Eliot. Absolutely goddamn right. 
Wrap around porches, forgotten gardens. Imposing in the gathering gloom. A single downstairs window glows. 
BEVERLY (OS) (CONT'D) Give the devil his due. Very few poets could've made it through Eliot's trial and come out, brilliantined and double-breasted and Anglican. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   2. 4   CONTINUED:                                                    4 
And now, a face fills the screen -- 
5   INT. BEVERLY'S DIMLY LIT STUDY - TWILIGHT                     5 
BEVERLY WESTON. A craggy, wise and deeply sad Okie.    We take a long moment, just to study that face. 
BEVERLY Not hard to imagine, faced with Eliot's first wife, lovely Viv, how Crane or Berryman might have reacted, just foot-raced to the nearest bridge; Olympian Suicidalists. 
Stares out the window at the darkening, ominous horizon. 
BEVERLY (CONT'D) Not Eliot: after sufficient years of ecclesiastical guilt, plop her in the nearest asylum and get on with it. 
He sits   at a cluttered desk, his face damp with sweat. Nurses a glass   of whiskey, his staggered delivery due more to his careful   selection of words than drunkenness. He's talking to someone   we do not yet see. 
BEVERLY (CONT'D) God-a-mighty. You have to admire the purity of the survivor's instinct. 
From somewhere upstairs, a THUD. He looks to the ceiling. 
BEVERLY (CONT'D) Violet. My wife. She takes pills, sometimes a great many. They affect... among other things, her equilibrium. Fortunately, they eliminate her need for equilibrium... 
6   INT. VIOLET'S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT                              6 
Full of shadows. She sits up slowly from rumpled sheets. We're on her profile, CLOSE, silhouetted against the faint light from the open bathroom door. She hesitates on the edge of the bed, getting her bearings. Finds a pack of Winstons, lights one. Listens to the voices filtering up from below. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft    3. 
7   INT. THE STUDY - TWILIGHT                                       7 
Beverly shifts, waiting for the sound of more movement from the rooms overhead. When there is none -- 
BEVERLY My wife takes pills and I drink. That's the bargain we've struck. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
8   INT. VIOLET'S BEDROOM/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - TWILIGHT               8 
She gathers herself to stand. Moves to the door. We FOLLOW HER CLOSELY. Her hair unkempt, her steps unsteady, into -- 
BEVERLY The reasons why we partake are anymore inconsequential. 
The hallway, walls lined with photos of long-dead pioneer ancestors and faded school photographs of three daughters. 
BEVERLY (CONT'D) The facts are: my wife takes pills and I drink. That's the bargain we've struck, just one paragraph of our marriage contract... cruel covenant. And these facts have over time made burdensome the maintenance of traditional American routine. 
She makes her way to the stairs starts down. 
BEVERLY (CONT'D) Rather than once more vow abstinence with my fingers crossed in the queasy hope of righting our ship, I've chosen to turn my life over to a Higher Power and join the ranks of the Hiring Class. 
The light from the study slices across the living room. 
BEVERLY (CONT'D) It's not a decision with which I'm entirely comfortable. I know how to launder my dirty undies. Done it all my life, but I'm finding it's getting in the way of my drinking. 
She can see a portion of Beverly's desk, a woman's legs. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   4. 8   CONTINUED:                                                     8 
BEVERLY (CONT'D) Sorry about the heat in here. My wife is cold-blooded and not just in the metaphorical sense. She does not believe in air-conditioning... as if it is a thing to be disbelieved. I knew your father, you know. Bought many a watermelon from Mr Youngblood's fruit stand. He did pass, didn't he?? 
JOHNNA Yes, sir. 
BEVERLY May I ask how? 
JOHNNA He had a heart attack. Fell into a flatbed truck full of wine grapes. 
Outside, the sound of a CAR pulling up. Ivy pulls back the drape and the shade, finds a big Cadillac arriving. 
IVY Aunt Mattie Fae's here. 
VIOLET She means to come in here and tell me what's what. 
IVY I don't know how Uncle Charlie puts up with it. 
VIOLET He smokes a lot of grass. 
IVY He does? 
VIOLET He smokes a lot of grass. 
15   INT/EXT. CHARLIE'S CADILLAC/WESTON HOUSE - DAY                15 
MATTIE FAE I told Vi, "Take all those goddamn books he's so fond of and make a big pile in the front yard and have yourself a bonfire." 
MATTIE FAE AIKEN, sixty-one, Violet's baby sister, larger than life, is in the passenger seat. CHARLIE, Mattie Fae's husband, easy-going, is behind the wheel. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   15. 15   CONTINUED:                                                   15 
CHARLIE You don't burn a man's books. 
MATTIE FAE You do, if the situation calls for it. 
CHARLIE The man's books didn't do anything. 
MATTIE FAE You get any ideas about just up and taking off, Charlie Aiken, you better believe -- 
CHARLIE I'm not going anywhere. 
Charlie parks, they climb out into the blinding sunlight. 
MATTIE FAE I'm saying if you did, I'll give you two days to get your head straight and then it's all going up in a blaze of glory. Not that you have any books lying around. I don't think I've ever seen you read a book in my life. 
CHARLIE That bother you? 
MATTIE FAE What's the last book you read? 
CHARLIE Beverly was a teacher; teachers read books, I'm in the upholstery business. 
Ivy comes out of the house to meet them. Mattie Fae spots her, makes a beeline for her, envelopes Ivy in a hug. 
MATTIE FAE Ah, sweetie. Your daddy's done this before. Just takes off, no call, nothing. I told your mother, "You pack that son-of-a-bitch's bags and have `em waiting for him on the front porch." 
Mattie Fae sweeps past Ivy into the -- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   16. 
16   INT. WESTON HOUSE - DAY                                     16 
Ivy and Charlie follow. 
MATTIE FAE Where's your mother? 
IVY Upstairs. 
CHARLIE They've always had trouble, Ivy. 
MATTIE FAE He'll come back again, I know he will, he always does. Beverly is a very complicated man. 
IVY Kind of like Charles. 
CHARLIE Yes, like Little Charles. Exactly -- 
MATTIE FAE Oh.   He's nothing like Little Charles. 
CHARLIE She just means in their sort of quiet complicated ways -- 
MATTIE FAE Little Charles isn't complicated, he's just unemployed. 
The phone begins to RING.   Ivy eyes it apprehensively. 
CHARLIE He's an observer. 
MATTIE FAE All he observes is the television. (and) Why is it so dark in here? 
CHARLIE So you can't even see Ivy's point? That Little Charles and Beverly share some kind of... complication. 
MATTIE FAE You have to be smart to be complicated. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   17. 16   CONTINUED:                                                    16 
The phone STOPS.    Violet's answered it upstairs. 
CHARLIE Are you saying our boy isn't smart? 
MATTIE FAE Yes, that's what I'm saying. 
Ivy steals glances upstairs, concerned about the phone. 
MATTIE FAE (CONT'D) I'm sweating. Are you sweating? 
CHARLIE Hell, yes, I'm sweating, it's ninety degrees in here. 
MATTIE FAE Feel my back. 
CHARLIE I don't want to feel your back. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) Goddamn, it's hot. 
Bill unlocks the trunk, begins unloading luggage. 
BILL Suppose your mom's turned on the air conditioner? 
BARBARA You kidding? Remember the parakeets? 
BILL The parakeets? 
BARBARA I didn't tell you about the parakeets? She got a parakeet for some insane reason, and the little fucker croaked after two days. So she went to the pet store and raised hell and they gave her another parakeet. That one died after one day. (MORE) "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   21. 19   CONTINUED:                                                     19 BARBARA (CONT'D) So she went back and they gave her a third parakeet and that one died too. So the chick from the pet store came out here to see just what in the hell this serial parakeet killer was doing to bump off these birds. 
They head for the house with suitcases, wilting in the heat. 
BILL And? 
BARBARA The heat. It was too hot. They were dying from the heat. 
BILL Jesus. 
BARBARA These are tropical birds, all right? They live in the fucking tropics. 
He laughs.    Barb looks over to Jean smoking by the fence. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) What, is she smoking a cigar? 
BILL Are you ready for this? 
BARBARA No.    No way. 
20   INT. WESTON HOUSE - AFTERNOON                                  20 
Charlie is poking around the old stereo, finds an LP, the TV beside him is tuned to a Royals game. 
CHARLIE Violet's a Clapton fan? 
Johnna passes through, Charlie holds up his empty bottle. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) `Scuse me, dear...could I trouble you for another beer? 
MATTIE FAE Goddam it, she's not a waitress. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   22. 20   CONTINUED:                                                   20 
CHARLIE I know that. 
MATTIE FAE Then get your own beer. 
JOHNNA (takes the empty/goes) I'll get it. 
MATTIE FAE I don't believe you. Watchin' a ball game, drinkin' beers. You have any sense of what's going on around you? 
CHARLIE Am I supposed to sit here like a statue? You're drinking whiskey. 
MATTIE FAE I'm having a cocktail. 
CHARLIE You're drinking straight whiskey! 
MATTIE FAE Just... show a little class. 
BARBARA ...Mom? 
Barbara and Bill have entered, are quickly descended upon by Mattie Fae and Charlie. Hugs, overlapping dialogue. 
MATTIE FAE (CONT'D)                     BARBARA Oh my God, Barbara --! You        Hi, Aunt Mattie Fae -- give me some sugar! 
MATTIE FAE (CONT'D)                    BILL Bill!     Look how skinny you     Hi, Mattie Fae. are! 
BILL Hi, Charlie. 
Jean enters behind her parents, stands sheepishly. 
MATTIE FAE Oh my gosh, will you look at this one? Come here and give your Aunt Mattie Fae some sugar! "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   23. 20   CONTINUED:                                                    20 
MATTIE FAE (CONT'D)                      CHARLIE My gosh, you're so big! Look       `Lo, Bill. Man you have at your boobs! Last time I         dropped some weight, haven't saw you, you looked like a         you? Hello, sweetheart. little boy! 
BARBARA Hi, Uncle Charlie. 
CHARLIE How was the flight from Denver? 
BILL Fine... 
Violet appears on the stairs, rushes to Barbara. 
VIOLET Barb... 
BARBARA It's okay, Mom. I'm here, I'm here. Shh, it's okay, I'm here. 
Ivy appears at the top of the stairs, watches her mother in her sister's arms. Bill turns to Charlie, quietly: 
BILL No word then? 
CHARLIE                         MATTIE FAE No.                                No, huh-uh. 
VIOLET                            BARBARA What am I going to do?             It's okay, Mom. 
JOHNNA My grandma. 
JEAN Is there something in it? 
JOHNNA My umbilical cord. 
Jean recoils.   Johnna smiles. 
JEAN Ewww, are you serious? 
JOHNNA When a Cheyenne is born, their umbilical cord is dried and sewn into a pouch. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft    27. 21   CONTINUED:                                                    21 
JEAN You're Cheyenne. Like that movie Powwow Highway. Did you see that? 
JOHNNA                                      * Yes. We wear it for the rest of our                    * lives. If we lose it, our souls belong nowhere and when we die our souls walk the Earth looking for where we belong. 
Johnna starts back for the house with her mint.       Off Jean -- 
22   INT. THE BACK PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON                           22 
A screened in back porch off the kitchen. Bill and Barb sit at an old linoleum table. 
BILL This was when? 
Violet stands smoking, unhappily watching Charlie and Mattie Fae climb into the Caddie and disappear down the gravel drive, heading back to Tulsa. 
VIOLET Saturday morning. The Indian girl made us biscuits and gravy. We ate some, he walked out the door, this door right there. Got into his truck. And that was it. 
Johnna enters with her mint, crosses into the kitchen. 
BARBARA He just left...? 
VIOLET I went to bed Saturday night, got up Sunday... still no Beverly. I didn't make much of it, thought he'd gone out on a bender. 
BARBARA Why would he do that? Not like he couldn't drink at home. Unless you were riding his ass. 
VIOLET I never said anything to him about his drinking, never got on him about it. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   28. 22   CONTINUED:                                                      22 
BARBARA Really. 
VILOET Barbara, I swear. He could drink himself into obliv-uh, obliv-en-um... 
BARBARA Oblivion. 
BILL So Sunday, still no sign of him... 
VIOLET Yes, Sunday. No sign. I started getting worried, don'tcha know. That's when I got worked up about that safety deposit box.   We kept an awful lot of cash in that box, some expensive jewelry. I had a diamond ring in that box appraised at seven thousand dollars -- 
Johnna returns with glasses of iced tea, each with a sprig of mint, delivers them to Bill and Barbara. 
BARBARA Wait, wait, wait, I'm missing something. Why do you care about a safety deposit box? 
VIOLET Well, I know what you'll say about this, but, your father and I had an urge-ment... arrangement. If something were to ever happen to one of us, the other one would go empty that box. 
BARBARA Because... 
BILL The money and jewelry gets rolled into the estate, bank seals the box until probate is settled. Can take months. 
VIOLET Right, that's right -- 
BARBARA You're such a fucking cynic. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   29. 22   CONTINUED:                                                   22 
VIOLET I knew you would disapprove -- 
Johnna cuts into a freshly baked apple pie in the kitchen. 
BARBARA Okay, what about the safety deposit box? 
VIOLET I had to wait for the bank to open on Monday. And after I emptied that box, I called the police and reported him missing. Monday morning. 
BARBARA And you only had Ivy call me today? 
VIOLET I didn't want to worry you, honey -- 
BARBARA                             BILL Jesus Christ.                     Vi, you sure there wasn't some event that triggered his leaving, some incident. 
VIOLET (CONT'D) You mean like a fight. 
Johnna places pieces of pie in front of Bill and Barb. 
BILL Yes. 
VIOLET No. And we fought enough... you know... but no, he just left. 
BARBARA Maybe he needed some time away from you. 
VIOLET That's nice of you to say. 
BARBARA Good old unfathomable Dad. 
VIOLET Oh. That man. What I first fell of with -- fell in love with, you know, was his mystery. I thought it was sexy as hell. (MORE) "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft     30. 22   CONTINUED:                                                     22 VIOLET (CONT'D) You knew he was the smartest one in the room, knew if he just said something... knock you out. But he'd just stand there, little smile on his face... not say a word. Sexy. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
BARBARA Daddy gave me his blessing. 
VIOLET `S what he told you. 
BARBARA Now you're going to tell me the true story, some terrible shit Daddy said behind my back? 
BILL Hey, enough. Everybody's on edge -- 
VIOLET Beverly didn't say terrible things behind your back -- 
BILL Vi, come on -- 
VIOLET He just told me he's disappointed in you because you settled. He thought                  * you had talent, as a writer.                         * 
BARBARA Daddy never said anything like that to you. What a load of absolute horseshit. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   34. 23   CONTINUED:                                                      23 
VIOLET Oh, horseshit, horseshit, let's all say horseshit. Say horseshit, Bill. 
BILL Horseshit. 
Violet goes. Barb and Bill exchange a look. Barb looks to Ivy, who's blank. Barb takes a beat, follows Violet. 
24   INT. BATHROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                                  24 
Violet is closing the bathroom door.       Barb stops her. 
BARBARA Are you high? 
VIOLET Excuse me. 
BARBARA I mean literally. You taking something? 
VIOLET A muscle relaxer. 
BARBARA Listen to me: I will not go through this with you again. 
VIOLET I don't know what you're talking about. 
BARBARA These fucking pills? Calls at three                     * AM about people in your backyard? 
VIOLET Stop yelling at me! 
BARBARA The police, all the rest of it? 
VIOLET It's not the same thing. I didn't have a reason. 
BARBARA So now it's okay to get hooked because you have a reason. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   35. 24   CONTINUED:                                                    24 
VIOLET I'm not hooked on anything. 
BARBARA I don't want to know if you are or not, I'm just saying I won't go -- 
VIOLET I'm not.   I'm in pain. 
BARBARA Because of your mouth. 
VIOLET Yes, because my mouth burns from the chemotheeeahh -- 
BARBARA Are you in a lot of pain? 
Violet starts to break down, sits on the lidded toilet. 
VIOLET Yes, I'm in pain. I have got... gotten cancer. In my mouth. And it burns like a... bullshit. And Beverly's disappeared and you're yelling at me. 
BARBARA I'm not yelling at you. 
VIOLET You couldn't come home when I got cancer but as soon as Beverly disappeared you rushed back -- 
BARBARA I'm sorry... you're right. I'm sorry. 
Barbara kneels, takes her mother's hand. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) Know where I think he is? I think he got some whiskey, a carton of cigarettes, and a couple of good spy novels... I think he got out on the boat, steered it to a nice spot, close to shore... and he's fishing, and reading, and drinking, maybe even writing a little. I think he'll walk right through that door any time. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft    36. 
25   INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/STAIRS/ATTIC ROOM - TWILIGHT           25 
Jean walks down the hall, perusing photos of her ancestors. Rail-thin, sunburned dust bowl farmers, WWII GIs standing in front of battered Packards before shipping out to die on the beaches of Normandy. Violet and Bev on their wedding day. Jean's mother and aunts in grade school, with prom dates. 
The photos end in a doorway that leads to a narrow, wooden staircase. Jean climbs it to -- 
26   INT. THE ATTIC BEDROOM - TWILIGHT                            26 
Finds Johnna on her bed in the small ascetic attic room, reading T.S. Eliot. Jean KNOCKS on the open door. 
JEAN Hi, again... Am I bugging you? 
JOHNNA No, do you need something? 
JEAN No, I thought maybe you'd like to smoke a bowl with me? 
JOHNNA No, thank you. 
JEAN Okay. I didn't know. (beat) Do you mind if I smoke a bowl? 
41   EXT. SKIATOOK LAKE ROAD - DAWN                               41 
The sun's just topped the horizon, throws long early shadows across the flat expanse of prairie. Scattered trees, a ribbon of asphalt leading to a distant lake, telephone poles. 
We're HIGH ABOVE the country road, following the Sheriff cruiser below. Barb's rental sedan trails behind. 
BARBARA (OS) I used to go out with that boy. That man. 
42   INT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - EARLY MORNING                     42 
Bill drives, Ivy up front with him. Barbara sits in the back with Jean. Watches the sheriff's car ahead. 
JEAN What man? The Sheriff? 
BARBARA In high school. He was my prom date. 
JEAN You're kidding. 
BARBARA Day of the prom, his father got drunk and stole his car, stole his own son's car, went somewhere, Mexico. Deon showed up at the door. He'd been crying. Confessed he didn't have a way to take me to the prom. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   48. 42   CONTINUED:                                                   42 
The cruiser slows, pulls through a pipe gate and over a cattle-crossing, heads for a small collection of emergency vehicles parked around a brush-strewn cove. Bev's old Chevy pick-up truck sits to one side. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) So we got a six-pack and broke into the chapel, stayed up all night talking and kissing. Now here he is, showing me -- (fights her emotions) It's so surreal. Thank God we can't tell the future. We'd never get out of bed. 
The cars stop.    The Sheriff gets out. 
BILL Let me go first, see what they need. 
Bill goes.    Barb fixes Jean with a look. 
BARBARA Listen to me: die after me, all right? I don't care what else you do, where you go, how you screw up your life, just... survive. Outlive me, please. 
They watch the men. A resolute Bill returns to get Barbara and Ivy. The sisters climb out, follow him to the water's edge. Jean waits a moment, then steps out of the car. 
Watches her father lead her mother down the small cracked concrete boat ramp to where the Sheriff waits by a covered body. As the Sheriff pulls back the tarp -- 
43   INT. A STERILE ROOM - DAY                                    43 
White walls, bright overhead light. We're CLOSE on a man's pale, lifeless hand. Another hand enters frame with a sponge, begins cleaning off the mud, filth. 
44   EXT. WESTON HOUSE - DAY                                      44 
The Weston clan walks to Beverly's Lincoln, Bill, Jean. Barb and Ivy help a distraught Violet. All wear mourning black. 
45   INT. THE STERILE ROOM - DAY                                  45 
Beverly's sodden shoes are removed, his socks. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   49. 45   CONTINUED:                                                      45 
His limp, greyish arm is guided into a starched white shirt- sleeve. The buttons carefully buttoned.

Bill drives. Jean beside him. Barbara and Ivy sit in the back seat, flanking Violet. They ride in silence. We study their faces, the brown countryside outside. 
Bill notices something in his rearview, a red speck, coming up fast, very fast. A sports car. 
It's suddenly right behind them, filling his mirrors. It waits for a semi loaded down with massive circular hay bales to pass in the opposite lane, then -- 
ROARS around. A Ferrari, it's throaty V-10 RUMBLING as it SCREAMS past, accelerates down the road. Bill and Jean exchange a look, watch it disappear. 
47   INT. THE STERILE ROOM - DAY                                     47 
Strong male hands lift Beverly's now dressed body carefully and place it into the casket. Adjust the pillow, comb his hair into place, fold his hands across his chest. 
We never see his face, never see his whole body. Only these small, intimate pieces. 
48   INT/EXT. CAR/FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF PAWHUSKA - DAY             48 
A few mourners enter the church as Bill pulls in to park, discovers the Ferrari already there. A woman emerging. 
BARBARA Holy shit, that's Karen. 
KAREN WESTON, forty, lithe, climbing from the car. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) Do you remember your Aunt Karen? 
JEAN Kind of... 
STEVE HEIDEBRECHT, fifty, greying, athletic, tan and handsome, gets out of the driver's side. 
BARBARA                                       * That must be this year's man. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   50. 48   CONTINUED:                                                      48 
Mattie Fae and Charlie are waiting for them, start over as Violet emerges into the blinding sun. Recoils slightly. Mattie Fae catches her, whispers comforts into her ear, helps her toward the church steps. 
We stay back, watching the Westons enter the church -- 
KAREN (VO) I spent so    much time in our bedroom pretending    my pillow was my husband and did he    like the dinner I made and where were    we going to vacation that winter and    he'd surprise me with tickets to    Belize and we'd kiss. 
49   INT. BEVERLY'S LINCOLN (MOVING) - AFTERNOON                     49 
Barbara drives, Karen beside her. Heat radiates off the road. They follow Charlie's Caddie, Vi and Ivy visible in the Caddie's back seat window ahead of us. 
KAREN I mean I'd kiss my pillow, and then I'd tell him I'd been to the doctor that day and I'd found out I was pregnant. I know how pathetic that sounds, but it was innocent enough. Then real life takes over, cause it always does -- 
52   INT. THE KITCHEN - AFTERNOON                                 52 
Johnna's at the sink, washing and breaking beans, every kitchen surface is covered with the large dinner she's preparing. Barbara enters, Karen still pursuing her. 
KAREN You get a read off Steve?   Did you like him? 
BARBARA We said two words to each other -- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   55. 52   CONTINUED:                                                        52 
KAREN You get a feel, though, don't you? Did you get a feel? 
BARBARA He seemed very nice, sweetheart -- 
Barb grabs a glass from the cabinet, opens the freezer for ice, lets her head linger in the cold. 
KAREN He is, and -- 
BARBARA -- but what I think doesn't matter. I'm not marrying him -- 
KAREN I guess what I'm telling you is that I'm happy. I've been unhappy most of my life,   my adult life. I doubt you've been aware of that. I know our lives have led us apart, you, me and Ivy. Maybe we're not as close as, as close as some families -- 
Barb gives up on the freezer, fills her glass with iced tea. 
BARBARA Yeah, we really need to talk about Mom, what to do about Mom -- 
KAREN -- but I think I haven't wanted to live my unhappiness in view of my family. But now I'm just really happy. I'd like us to get to know each other a little better. 
Barbara stares at her, what is she talking about? 
BARBARA Yes.    Yes. 
Karen wraps her arms around Barbara. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) Okay.   Yes. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   56. 
53   EXT. PAWHUSKA LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON          53 
The Ferrari pulls into the lot. Bill crawls out, heads for the store. An anxious Jean calls after him. 
JEAN Hurry, okay? 
BILL I will, sweetheart. 
Steve joins Jean, leans against the car. Throughout the following they watch Bill shop for wine inside. 
STEVE Is it always this hot? 
JEAN Usually it's hotter. 
STEVE Hard to imagine. (a beat) How old are you, about, seventeen? 
JEAN Fourteen. 
STEVE Fourteen, right... Know what I was doing when I was fourteen? Cattle processing. Know what that is? 
JEAN It doesn't sound good. 
STEVE Slaughterhouse sanitation. 
JEAN That's disgusting. 
STEVE I don't recommend it. But hey. Put food on the table. Get it? 
An impatient Jean watches her father comparing wines inside. 
STEVE (CONT'D) What's that smell? 
She sniffs. Doesn't smell much of anything really. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   57. 53   CONTINUED:                                                     53 
JEAN Dumpster over there? 
STEVE Nah, that's not what I'm smelling. 
He sniffs the air, then sniffs her. 
JEAN What are you doing? 
STEVE Do I smell what I think I smell? 
JEAN What do you smell? 
STEVE What do you think I smell? 
JEAN I think you smell that dumpster. 
He whiffs, hard, breathing her in. 
STEVE Is that... pot? You smoking pot? 
JEAN No. 
STEVE You can tell me. 
JEAN No. 
BARBARA I've seen where that gets me! I'm sick of the whole notion of the enduring female. GROW UP!

BILL Our kid is just trying to deal with this goddamn madhouse you've dragged her into. 
BARBARA This madhouse is my home. 
BILL Think about that statement for a second, why don't you? 
BARBARA Jean is here with me because this is a family event. 
BILL Jean's here with you because she's a buffer between you and the shrill insanity of your mother. 
BARBARA Y'know, you'd have a lot more credibility if you had any credibility. 
BILL You can't resist, can you? 
BARBARA You're a pretty easy mark. 
BILL You're so goddamn self-righteous, you know? You're so -- 
BARBARA Surely you must've known when you started porking Pippi Longstocking you were due for a little self- righteousness, just a smidge of indignation on my part -- 
BILL Maybe I split because of it. 
They've reached the back porch stairs. She turns on him. 
BARBARA Is this your confession, then, when you finally unload all? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   69. 60   CONTINUED:                                                    60 
BILL You're thoughtful, Barbara, but you're not open. You're passionate, but you're hard. You're a good, decent, funny, wonderful woman, and I love you, but you're a pain in the ass. 
Bill pushes past her up the stairs, disappears inside. 
61   INT. BEVERLY'S STUDY - AFTERNOON                              61 
Violet stands in the middle of the room. Sunlight streams in through the windows surrounding her. Approaches Beverly's swivel chair, touches the back, ...slowly spins it ...sits. 
VIOLET August... your month. Locusts are raging, "Summer psalm become summer wrath." `Course it's only August out there. In here... who knows? (and then) All right... okay. "The Carriage held but just Ourselves," dum-de-dum...mm, best I got... Emily Dickenson's all I got... something something, "Horse's Heads Were Toward Eternity..." 
Produces a bottle of pills, shakes one out, takes it. 
VIOLET (CONT'D) That's for me. One for me. 
Surveys the photos behind his desk. The girls. Vi and Bev together in happier times. Picks up the hardback Meadowlark Bill left. Finds Beverly's reading glasses on the desk, puts them on. Thumbs through it, finds the dedication: simply: 
VIOLET (CONT'D) For My Violet... 
Violet smiles ruefully, takes another pill. 
VIOLET (CONT'D) For the girls, God love `em. 
Surveys the book with something bordering on disgust. Another pill. Sits. Waiting. For what? She's not sure. 
BARBARA (OS) Mom?!   Food's on the table! 
She takes a final look around, takes one last pill. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   70. 
62   INT. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON                                62 
Johnna, Karen, Steve and Mattie Fae carry in serving dishes, set them down on the already overladen table. Charlie pours himself a sweet tea. 
KAREN This is lovely! You do all this? 
JOHNNA                         MATTIE FAE Mm-hmm.                         She's a wonder, this one. 
Bill passes through, carries us into the living room where he finds Jean, still watching the movie. 
BILL Turn that off, it's time to eat. 
JEAN Don't suppose I could eat in here? 
BILL You suppose right. 
Ivy comes down the stairs, looking. 
IVY Did I hear Little Charles? 
CHARLIE He went back out to the car. 
63   EXT. BACK YARD - AFTERNOON                                  63 
Ivy steps out onto the porch. Little Charles is by his father's car, retrieving a Pyrex dish. 
LITTLE CHARLES Mom's casserole. 
Shuts the door, rests the casserole on the hood. 
IVY They said you overslept. 
LITTLE CHARLES Maybe I purposely accidentally overslept. I don't know. I'm sorry. 
IVY Please. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   71. 63   CONTINUED:                                                   63

Steve hustles into the kitchen to talk on the phone. 
CHARLIE We ask that you watch over Beverly, too, as he, as he... as he... makes his journey. We thank thee, O Lord, that we are able to join together to pay tribute to this fine man, in his house, with his beautiful daughters. We are truly blessed in our, our fellowship, our togetherness, our... our fellowship. Thank thee for the food, O Lord, that we can share this food and replenish our bodies with... nutrients.

CHARLIE (CONT'D) We recognize now more than ever the power, the... joy of family. We ask that you bless and watch over this family. Amen. 
STEVE Amen.   Sorry folks. 
BILL Let's eat. 
They begin to eat.     Everyone but Violet, who smokes instead. 
VIOLET Barb, have any use for that sideboard? 
BARBARA Hm? 
VIOLET That sideboard there, you have any interest in that? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   75. 64   CONTINUED:                                                    64

VIOLET I'm getting rid of a lot of this stuff and I thought you might want that sideboard. 
BARBARA No, Mom, I... I wouldn't have any way to get that home to Colorado. 
KAREN Really pretty. 
VIOLET Mm.   Maybe Ivy'll take it. 
IVY I have something like that, remember -- 
VIOLET Clearing all this out of here. I want to have a brand new everything. 
BARBARA I. I guess I'm just sort of... not prepared to talk about your stuff. 
VIOLET Suit yourself. 
STEVE This food is just spectacular.

IVY You like your food, Mom? 
VIOLET I haven't tried much of it, yet -- 
BARBARA Johnna cooked this whole meal by herself.

VIOLET (CONT'D) Y'all did know she's getting paid, right? 
CHARLIE Jean, so I'm curious, when you say you don't eat meat, you mean you don't eat meat of any kind? 
JEAN Right. 
CHARLIE And is that for health reasons, or...? 
JEAN When you eat meat, you ingest an animal's fear. 
VIOLET Ingest what? It's fur? 
JEAN Fear. 
VIOLET I thought she said -- 
CHARLIE How do you do that? You can't eat fear. 
JEAN Sure you can. What happens to you, when you feel afraid? Doesn't your body produce all sorts of chemical reactions? 
CHARLIE Does it? 
LITTLE CHARLES                            IVY It does.                             Yes.

LITTLE CHARLES -- yep, and cortisol -- 
JEAN Don't you think an animal experiences fear? 
STEVE You bet it does. I used to work in a cattle processing plant, lot of fear flying around that place. 
JEAN So when you eat an animal, you're eating all that fear it felt when it was slaughtered to make food. 
CHARLIE Wow. You mean I've been eating fear, what, three times a day for sixty years? 
MATTIE FAE This one won't have a meal `less there's meat in it. 
MATTIE FAE What's the matter? 
LITTLE CHARLES                         IVY Dad --?                             You okay, Uncle -- 
CHARLIE I got a big bite of fear! I'm shakin' in my boots! Fear never tasted so good. 
Laughter.    Charlie digs into his plate ravenously. 
STEVE Right, right, it's pretty good once you get used to the taste. 
BARBARA I catch her eating a cheeseburger every now and again. 
JEAN I do not! 
BARBARA Double cheeseburger, bacon, extra fear. 
JEAN Mom, you are such a liar! 
More laughter. Violet stares at Jean.

VIOLET We took care of it some time back. 
BARBARA Mom, we don't want to talk about this. 
VIOLET I want to talk about it. What about what I want to talk about, that count for anything? (beat) Bev made some good investments, believe it or not, and we had money for you girls in his will, but we talked it over after some years passed and decided to change things, leave everything to me. We never got around to taking care of it legally, but you should know he meant to leave the money to me. 
BARBARA Okay. 
VIOLET Okay? (looks to Ivy, Karen) Okay? 
IVY Okay. 
VIOLET Karen?   Okay? 
Uncertain, Karen looks to Steve, then Barbara. 
BARBARA Okay. 
KAREN Okay. 
VIOLET Okay. But now some of this furniture, some of this old shit you can just have. I don't want it, got no use for it. Maybe I should have an auction. 
MATTIE FAE Sure, an auction's a fine idea -- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   83. 64   CONTINUED:                                                      64 
VIOLET Some things, though, like the silver, that's worth a pretty penny. But if you like I'll sell it to you, cheaper'n I might get in an auction. 
BARBARA Or you might never get around to the auction and then we can just have it for free after you die. 
IVY Barbara... 
Beat.   Violet coolly studies Barbara. 
VIOLET You might at that. 
LITTLE CHARLES Excuse me, Bill? I'm wondering, the reading you did, those poems --? 
VIOLET Where are you living now, Bill? You want this old sideboard? 
BILL I beg your pardon. 
VIOLET You and Barbara are separated, right? Or you divorced already? 
BILL ...We're separated. 
VIOLET (to Barbara) Thought you could slip that one by me, didn't you? 
BARBARA What is the matter with you? 
VIOLET Nobody slips anything by me. I know what's what. Your father thought he's slipping one by me, right? No way. I'm sorry you two're having trouble, maybe you can work it out.

BARBARA Help us to benefit from an illustration of your storybook marriage. 
VIOLET Truth is, you can't compete with a younger woman. One of those unfair things in life. Is there a younger woman involved? 
BARBARA You've said enough on this topic, I think. 
BILL Yes.   There's a younger woman. 
VIOLET Y'see?   Odds're against you there, babe. 
IVY Mom believes women don't grow more attractive with age. 
KAREN Oh, I disagree, I -- 
VIOLET I didn't say they "don't grow more attractive," I said they get ugly. And it's not really a matter of opinion, Karen dear. You've only just started to prove it yourself. 
IVY Please, momma. 
VIOLET I told you, I'm just telling the --

The hallway is empty, but we hear the sounds of the search coming from the bedroom. Barbara appears, looks through the linen closet, looking behind stacked towels and old electric blankets. Finds a bottle of pills in the back. 
Ivy comes upstairs, followed closely by Karen. Hold out pill        * bottles, Barb adds them to the ones she's already collected in a large Ziplock bag.

IVY Charles and I are going to New York.

IVY We have plans. 
BARBARA Like what? 
IVY None of your business.

Karen moves to her mother, sits next to her on the swing. Barb leans against a fence post, Ivy hangs back.                      * 
KAREN I get embarrassed just thinking about it. 
Karen takes a tube of hand creme from her purse. 
VIOLET Oh... nothing to be embarrassed about. Secret crushes, secret schemes. Province of teenage girls. I can't imagine anything more delicate, or bittersweet. Some part of you girls I always identified with... no matter how old you get, a woman's hard-pressed to throw off that part of herself. (to Karen, re: hand creme) That smells good. 
KAREN It's apple. You want some? 
VIOLET Yes, please. 
Violet puts out her cigarette. Karen passes her the creme. 
VIOLET (CONT'D) I ever tell you the story of Raymond Qualls? Not much story to it. Boy I had a crush on when I was thirteen or so. Rough-looking boy, beat-up Levis, messy hair. Terrible underbite.

He was so proud of those boots, you could tell, way he'd strut around, all arms and elbows, puffed up and cocksure. I decided I needed to get a girly pair of those same boots and I convinced myself he'd ask me to go steady. He'd see me in those boots and say "Now there's the gal for me." 
Violet lights another cigarette.                                    * 
VIOLET (CONT'D) Found the boots in a window downtown and just went crazy: praying for those boots, rehearsing the conversation I'd have with Raymond when he saw me in my boots. Must've asked my momma a hundred times if I could get those boots. "What do you want for Christmas, Vi?" "Momma, I'll give all of it up just for those boots." Bargaining, you know? She started dropping hints about a package under the tree she had wrapped up, about the size of a boot box, nice wrapping paper. "Now, Vi, don't you cheat and look in there before Christmas morning." Little smile on her face. Christmas morning, I was up like a shot, boy, under the tree, tearing open that box. There was a pair of boots, all right... men's work boots, holes in the toes, chewed up laces, caked in mud and dog shit. Lord, my momma laughed for days. 
Silence. 
BARBARA Please don't tell me that's the end of the story. 
VIOLET Oh, no.   That's the end. 
Ivy shakes her head, goes inside. She's had enough of Violet to last a lifetime. 
KAREN You never got the boots? "August" 11/09/12 Pink Draft   101. 72   CONTINUED:                                                      72 
VIOLET No, huh-uh. 
BARBARA Okay, well, that's the worst story I ever heard. That makes me wish for a heartwarming claw hammer story. 
VIOLET My momma was a nasty-mean old lady.   I suppose that's where I get it from. 
An awkward moment. 
KAREN You're not nasty-mean. You're our mother and we love you. 
But then, another pill bottle.       And another. 
BARBARA We'll hang on to the bucket of these we have at home. For evidence. For your trial. 
She gets up to go, gets to the door, turns and fires one last pill bottle at him. Leaves. Ivy lingers, grins at Burke. 
78   INT/EXT. TALLGRASS PRAIRIE PRESERVE/BEV'S LINCOLN - DAY       78 
The sun parched Indian grass and Turkey Toot are wilting but stirred by prairie winds. Bev's old Lincoln follows a thread of blacktop through the tall grass. Barb drives, Ivy up front. Karen's in the back with Violet. 
VIOLET Pull the car over. 
BARBARA We'll be home in a few minutes. 
VIOLET Pull the car over. (beat) I'm going to be sick. 
Barbara looks back, sees her mother means this literally, pulls to the side of the road. Violet gets out quickly. 
We stay with Barbara as she climbs out of the car, stares across the road, waiting for Violet, who can be heard retching. Karen and Ivy still in the car. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   106. 78   CONTINUED:                                                    78 
The sound fades as Barbara contemplates the prairie and for a long moment... loses herself, back to this land, to her home. Her expression is unreadable, enigmatic. 
Then behind her, out of focus, we become aware of Violet running away, across the prairie, through the tall grass. 
Barbara turns, simply to get back in the car, sees Violet running through the field. 
BARBARA Mom? 
Violet keeps running. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) Mom?!   Where are you going? 
Barbara watches for another moment. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) Goddamn it. Mom! 
Barbara takes off after her. Ivy and Karen climb out, but don't follow. Shield their eyes to watch the chase. 
It's an odd sight, the two women, racing through the grass. One almost seventy, the other nearing fifty. 
Barbara is slow in her pursuit at first, maybe because of her shoes, or maybe because she just feels silly. Then realizes that Violet is not stopping... not unless Barbara stops her. 
Violet runs through the tall grass, puts a foot wrong, goes down. Barbara catches up, out of breath, collapses. They lay on the ground, wheezing, sweating. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) Where the fuck are you going, Mom? 
And now we see the full beauty of the land, the distant horizon, the high cumulous clouds, the endless blue sky. Barb and Violet two dots, lost in the unforgiving prairie. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) There's nowhere to go. 
79   INT/EXT. LINCOLN/WESTON HOUSE DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON             79 
Barb pulls the Lincoln in beside Charlie's Caddie and Ivy's Honda. Shuts off the engine. Ivy and Karen climb out, start back for the house. Barbara turns to Violet. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   107. 79   CONTINUED:                                                      79

VIOLET Please, honey -- 
BARBARA No, it's important I say this. I lost my temper at dinner and went too far.                    * 
VIOLET Barbara. The day, the funeral... the pills. I was spoiling for a fight and you gave it to me. 
BARBARA So... truce? 
VIOLET (laughs) Truce. 
They take a long moment, then --                                      * 
BARBARA What now? 
VIOLET How do you mean? 
BARBARA Don't you think you should at least consider a rehab center? 
Karen turns, realizing they're not following. Should she go back to the car? She decides no, continues inside. 
VIOLET I can't go through that again. No, I can do this. You got rid of my pills, right? 
BARBARA All we could find. 
VIOLET I don't have that many hiding places. 
BARBARA Mom, now, come on. 
VIOLET You wanna search me? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   108. 79   CONTINUED:                                                     79 
BARBARA Uh... no. 
VIOLET If the pills are gone, I'll be fine. Just need a few days to get my feet under me. 
BARBARA I can't imagine what all this must be like for you right now. I just want you to know, you're not alone. If you need any help -- 
VIOLET I don't need help. 
Ivy and Little Charles go. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) I don't understand this meanness. I look at you and your sister and the way you talk to people and I don't understand it. I can't understand why folks can't be respectful of one another. I don't think there's any excuse for it. My family didn't treat each other that way. 
MATTIE FAE Maybe that's because your family -- 
CHARLIE You had better not say anything about my family right now. I mean it. We buried a man yesterday I loved very much. And whatever faults he may have had, he was a good, kind, decent person. And to hear you tear into your own son not even a day later dishonors Beverly's memory. We've been married thirty-eight years. I wouldn't trade them for anything. But if you can't find a generous place in your heart for your own son, we're not going to make it to thirty-nine. 
He goes. She takes a moment to collect herself, turns to follow, finds Barbara standing out in the open kitchen door.       * There's an awkward moment. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   112. 80   CONTINUED:                                                     80

MATTIE FAE That's -- you have a cigarette, hon? 
BARBARA No, I quit years ago. 
MATTIE FAE So did I. Just sounded good to me. I thought at dinner... at that horrible dinner last night, seemed like, something might be going on between Ivy and Little Charles. Do you know if that's true? 
BARBARA Oh, this is...I'm not sure what to... 
MATTIE FAE Look, just. Is it true? 
BARBARA Yes.    It's true. 
MATTIE FAE Okay.   That can't happen.

BARBARA -- but believe it or not, it's not as uncommon as you might -- 
MATTIE FAE Listen to me. They're not cousins. 
BARBARA Beg pardon? 
MATTIE FAE Little Charles is not your cousin. He's your brother. He's your blood brother. He is not your cousin. He is your blood brother. Half-brother. He's your father's child. Which means that he is Ivy's brother. Do you see? Little Charles and Ivy are brother and sister. 
Karen and Steve enter from outside. 
BARBARA Go away. 
KAREN We're just going to -- 
BARBARA Go away!   NOW! GO AWAY!

MATTIE FAE Yes.   Y'know, I'm not proud of this. 
BARBARA Really. You people amaze me. What, were you drunk? Was this just some -- 
MATTIE FAE I wasn't drunk, no. Maybe it's hard for you to believe, looking at me, knowing me the way you do, all these years. I know to you, I'm just your old fat Aunt Mattie Fae. I'm more than that, sweetheart, there's more to me than that. I don't know why Little Charles is such a disappointment to me. Maybe he, well, I don't know why. I'm disappointed for him, more than anything. I made a mistake, a long time ago. Okay? I paid for it. But the mistake ends here. 
BARBARA If Ivy found out, it would destroy her. 
MATTIE FAE I'm sure as hell not gonna tell her. You have to find a way to stop it. You have to put a stop to it.

It's late, the house still. We MOVE through dark rooms, drawn to the murmur of SOUND and a faint sound coming from outside the kitchen --

KAREN Out at the car. We're leaving. Back to Florida, tonight, now. Me and Steve, together. Want to give me some grief about that? 
BARBARA Now wait just a goddamn -- 
KAREN You better find out from Jean exactly what went on before you start pointing fingers. Cause I doubt Jean's blameless in all this. And I'm not blaming her, just cause I said she's not blameless doesn't mean I've blamed her. I'm saying she might share in the responsibility. It's not cut and dried, black and white, good and bad. It lives where everything lives: somewhere in the middle. Where the rest of us live, everyone but you. 
BARBARA Karen-- 
KAREN He's not perfect. Just like the rest of us, down here in the muck. I'm no angel myself. I've done some things I'm not proud of. Things you'll never know about. I may even have to do some things I'm not proud of again. Cause sometimes life puts you in a corner that way.

Karen bursts through the screen door, rushes down the steps to Steve's waiting Ferrari, it's lights already on, engine running. Throws her suitcase in the back. 
Barb steps out onto the porch as it reverses, SLAMS into gear and accelerates down the drive, spewing gravel as it goes. 
Bill comes out, watches it disappear with Barbara.      Then:

IVY I have lived in this town, year in and year out, hoping against hope someone would come into my life-- 
BARBARA Don't get all Carson McCullers on me. Now wipe that tragic look off your face and eat some catfish. 
They head into the dining room, find Violet smoking, working on her jigsaw puzzle.

Johnna reenters with plates, then goes. 
BARBARA Eat. 
VIOLET No. 
BARBARA Eat it.    Mom? Eat it. 
VIOLET No. 
BARBARA Eat it, you fucker.   Eat that catfish. 
VIOLET Go to hell. 
BARBARA That doesn't cut any fucking ice with me. Now eat that fucking fish. 
IVY Mom, I have something to talk to you-- 
BARBARA No you don't. 
IVY Barbara-- 
BARBARA No you don't. Shut up.    Shut the fuck up. 
IVY Please-- 
VIOLET What's to talk about? 
IVY Mom-- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   127. 88   CONTINUED:                                                      88 
BARBARA Forget it.     Eat that fucking fish. 
VIOLET I'm not hungry. 
BARBARA Eat it. 
VIOLET NO! 
IVY Mom, I need to--! 
VIOLET NO! 
IVY MOM! 
VIOLET Your father tore himself up over it, thirty some-odd years, but Beverly wouldn't have been Beverly if he didn't have plenty to brood about. 
IVY Mom, what are you...? 
BARBARA Oh honey... 
VIOLET Better you girls know now though, now you're older. Never know when someone might need a kidney. 
Ivy looks from Violet to Barbara... suddenly lurches away from the table, knocking over her chair. 
IVY Why in God's name did you tell me this? 
VIOLET Hey, what do you care? 
IVY You're monsters. 
VIOLET Come on now -- 
IVY Monsters... 
VIOLET Who's the injured party here? 
Ivy flees from the dining room, pursued by Barbara -- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft    131. 
89   INT. FRONT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                               89 
BARBARA Ivy, listen -- 
IVY Leave me alone. 
BARBARA When Mattie Fae told me, I didn't know what to do -- 
Ivy runs from the house. 
90   EXT. WESTON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                                90 
Ivy rushes to her car, still followed by Barbara. 
BARBARA I was trying to protect you -- 
IVY We'll go anyway, we'll still go away. 
Ivy gets in the car, starts it, revs the engine.    Barbara tries to open the car door. 
BARBARA This is not my fault. 
Barbara pounds on the car window. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) I didn't tell you, Mom told you! It wasn't me, it was Mom! 
The car window slides down. 
IVY There's no difference. 
Ivy floors the car, roars out of the driveway, leaving Barb standing there. After a moment, Barb turns, stares up at the house, angry, resolute. Starts back inside. 
91   INT. WESTON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                                91 
Finds Violet still at the table, lighting a cigarette. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   132. 91   CONTINUED:                                                   91 
VIOLET We couldn't let Ivy run off with Little Charles. Just wouldn't be right. 
Barbara doesn't respond, keeps her distance. 
VIOLET (CONT'D) She'll be back. She's a sweet girl, Ivy, and I love her to death. But she isn't strong. Not like you. Or me. 
BARBARA You knew about Daddy and Mattie Fae? 
VIOLET Oh sure. I never told them I knew. But your father knew. He knew I knew. But we never talked about it. I chose the higher ground. (and then) If I'd had the chance, there at the end, I would've told him, "I hope this isn't about Little Charles, cause you know I know all about that." If I'd reached him at that motel, I would've said, "You'd be better off if you quit sulking about this ancient history." 
BARBARA ...what motel? 
VIOLET I called over there on Monday after I got into that safety deposit box. But it was too late, he'd checked out. 
BARBARA How did you know where he was? 
Violet is growing agitated with the interrogation. 
VIOLET The note. He said I could call him over at the Country Squire Motel -- 
BARBARA He left a note? 
VIOLET And I did, I called him on Monday. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft       133. 91   CONTINUED:                                                       91 
BARBARA After you got the money out of your                       * safety deposit box... 
VIOLET We had an arrangement. You have to                        * understand, for people like your                          * father and me, who never had any                          * money, ever, as kids, people from our                     * generation, that money is important.                      *

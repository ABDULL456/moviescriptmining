OVER BLACK We hear labored breathing. 
BLACK FRAME QUOTE APPEARS: 
"Revenge is a dish best served cold" 
- Old Klingon Proverb - QUOTE FADES OUT 
WE STAY ON BLACK ...breathing continues... 
Then a MAN'S VOICE talks over the breathing; 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Do you find me sadistic? 
CUT TO: 
BLACK AND WHITE CU of a WOMAN lying on the floor, looking up. The woman on the floor has just taken a severe spaghetti-western-style gang beating. Her face is bloody, beaten up, and torn. The high contrast B/W turning the red blood into black blood. 
A hand belonging to the off-screen Man's Voice ENTERS FRAME holding a white handkerchief with the name "BILL" sewn in the corner, and begins tenderly wiping away the blood from the young woman's face. Little by little as the Male Voice speaks, the beautiful face underneath is revealed to the audience. But what can't be wiped away, is the white hot hate that shines in both eyes at the man who stands over her, the "BILL" of the title. 
In another    age men who shook the world for their    own purposes were called    conquerors. In our age, the men who    shake the planet for    their own power and greed are called    corrupters. And of the    world's corrupters Bill stands alone.    For while he 
corrupts the world, inside himself he is pure. 
BILL'S VOICE (O.S.) I bet I could fry an egg on your head about now, if I wanted to. 
He continues wiping away the blood. 
BILL'S VOICE (O.S.) No kiddo, I'd like to believe, even now, you're aware enough to know there isn't a trace of sadism in my actions... Okay - Maybe towards these other jokers - bot not your. 
OVERHEAD SHOT We see for a moment, A WIDE SHOT looking down at the woman on the floor. Bill (from behind) bent down over her. Four others in black suits, standing over her (three are female, one is male). And about four DEAD BODIES lying in their own blood. We also see we're in a wedding chapel that's been redecorated by blood death and gunfire. And firstly or lastly, depending on the viewer, that the woman on the floor is dressed in a white bridal gown. This woman is our Heroine, and from this moment forth she will only be referred to as The BRIDE. 
Back to CU of The BRIDE. 
The BRIDE on the floor. Her pretty face is wiped clean. 
BILL'S VOICE (O.S.) No Kiddo at this moment, this is me at my most masochistic. 
While still in her CU The Bride speaks for the first time in the picture. She looks up at the man standing over her and says; 
THE BRIDE Bill, I'm pregnant. It's your baby. 
After saying the "y" in "baby", we hear a BANG and The Bride receives a bullet in the side of her head. 
CUT TO: BLACK SCREEN: Presentation Credit 
"The 4th Film by QUENTIN TARANTINO" 
CUT TO: 
B/W CU of a Young MAN in a TUXEDO. Shot to death. 
The BRIDE speaks to us in a VO; 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) That's Tim, Arthur's best friend. 
CU A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN in a frilly pink dress with two bullet holes in her. 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) That's his girlfriend Janeen. 
CU A PLUMP YOUNG WOMAN, shot to death, wedding bouquet still clutched in her dead fist. 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) That's my best friend from work Erica. 
AN OLDER MAN IN A BLACK SUIT shot fulla holes. 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) That's the minister. I think his name was Reverend Hillhouse. 
A DEAD OLDER WOMAN by his side in an old-fashioned flower print dress. 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) That's his wife. 
A DEAD OLDER WOMAN slumped over an organ. 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) Organ player, don't know her name. 
A YOUNG MAN IN A TUXEDO WITH HIS FACE BLOWN OFF. 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) That's Arthur. Arthur Plympton. The 
name on his driver's license was Charles Arthur Plympton, but for some reason he preferred Arthur. Maybe if he went by Carles people would have called him Charlie. If that was his reason for going by Arthur I can understand it. Nothing wrong with the name Charlie, except he didn't look like a Charlie, he looked like an Arthur. Obviously you'll have to take my word on this. Speaking of names, I was about two seconds away from becoming Mrs. Charles Arthur Plympton. 
And then finally, The Bride. 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) And that, that's me. I'm the Bride. 
We do a DISSOLVE from the Bride looking dead in the bridal gown 
To 
The Bride, still in B/W, still in a bridal gown, but the asswippin she took in the scene before must have been in the past, because she looks like a million dollars now.......three million even. 
INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT 
The Bride behind the wheel of a Volkswagen Karman Ghia convertible. Her long blodne hair whipping in the wind. A PROCESS SHOT PLAYS behind her. 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) Looked dead, didn't I? Well I wasn't, but it wasn'T for lack fo trying, I can tell you that. Actually Bill's last bullet put me in a coma. A coma I was to lie in for five years. When I woke up, ...I went on what the movie advertisements refer to as a Roaring Rampage of Revenge. I roarded and I rampaged and I got bloody satisfaction. In all, I've killed 33 people to get to this piont right now. I have only one more. The last one. 
The one I'M driving to right now. The only one left. And when I arrive at my destination..... .... I'm gonna Kill Bill. 
TITLE SEQUENCE 
As a female-sung ballad of heartbreaking lament plays on the soundtrack, we see the credits of "Kill Bill" play over the Bride in her bridal gown, driving to the film's climax. 
The sequence ends with the Bride arriving at Bill's home. 
WE FADE TO BLACK 
BLACK FRAME TITLE APPEARS: 
Chapter one 
CUT TO: 
EX CU The BRIDE's EYEBALL IN GLORIOUS COLOR WE CUT OUT ONE...TWO...THREE...TO A CU of The BRIDE IN GLORIOUS COLOR She's sitting in a parked pickup truck. Her eyes focused on something. 
The BRIDE'S POV: A very homey three-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of Pasadena, California. A purple Dodge Neon sits parked in the driveway. A tricylce, a big wheel, and a few toys sprinkle the grass on the front yard. A mailbox with the name "The BELLS" on it sits out in front of the lawn. We hear but don't see ice cream truck bells. 
SUBTITLE APPEARS AT SCREEN BOTTOM: 
"The city of PASADENA, CALIFORNIA" 
We hear a Car Door Open and Close....THEN....The Bride Walks into the shot, heading for the front door. 
EX CU: A long, white female finger pushes a doorbell. 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL PASADENA STREET - DAY 
The front door opens and an attractive black HOUSEWIFE the same age as The Bride stands in the doorway. The Housewife's face shows immediate recognition of the blonde on her doorstep. 
The BRIDE on the porch; we do a quick Shaw-Brothers-style Zoom into her eyes. 
FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE (That means our Heroine is remembering something, and we see it with an orange filter.) We're back inside the wedding chapel. The Bride is taking the beating of her life by four people in black suits. A black woman PUNCHES HER in the face... WE see it's the black housewife, five years earlier. 
The BRIDE ON THE PORCH We Zoom quick out of her eyes to CU, a VENGEANCE THEME PLAYS LOUD ON THE SOUNDTRACK. (Whenever we hear this theme throughout the picture, we'll quickly learn what accompanies it is The Bride goin Krakatoa all over whoever's ass happens to be in front of her at that moment.) As the Vengeance Theme plays, a Vein in The Bride's forehead begins to pulsate. When the Vengeance Theme stops, The Bride ATTACKS The Housewife. 
INT. HOUSEWIFE'S NICE HOME - DAY 
The white woman and the black woman FLY into the center of the living room, CRASHING onto her coffe table in front of the sofa. 
VERNITA You have every right to wanna get even -- 
THE BRIDE -- But that's where you're wrong, Vernita. I don't want to get even. To get even, even Steven. I would have to kill you, go into Nikki's room, kill her, then wait for your old man, Dr. Bell, to come home and kill him. That would make us even. No, my unborn daughter will just hafta be satisfied with your death at her mother's hands. 
Vernita knows no matter what else is said, blood will spill. 
VERNITA When do we do this? 
THE BRIDE It all depends... When do you want to die? Tomorrow? The day after tomorrow? That's about as long as I'll wait. 
VERNITA How bout tonight, bitch? 
THE BRIDE Spendid. Where? 
VERNITA There's a baseball diamond where our little league has its games, about a mile from here. We meet there around two-thirty in the morning, dressed all in black, your hair in a black stocking, and we have us a knife fight, we won't be 
bothered. I have to fix Nikki's cereal. 
As they continue to talk, Vernita pulls down a cereal bowl for her daughter and lays it on the kitchen counter. 
THE BRIDE Bill said you were one of the best ladies he'd ever seen with an edged weapon. 
Vernita moves to another kitchen cabinet, and pulls down a box of the sugar cereal, "Kaboom." 
VERNITA Fuck you, bitch, I know he didn't qualify it, so you can just kiss my motherfuckin ass, Black Mamba. (snorts to herself) Black Mamba, I shoulda been motherfuckin Black Mamba. 
As the two females continue to talk, Vernita reaches her hand inside the cereal box. 
THE BRIDE Weapon of choice? And if you want to stick with your butcher knife, I'm cool with that. 
VERNITA Very funny. 
Vernita FIRES A GUN from inside the cereal box at The Bride.... 
.... The bullet explodes out of the cardboard box, and HITS the coffee mugh directly in front of The Bride, BLOWING IT TO SMITHEREENS. 
The Bride THROWS HERSELF ON THE FLOOR.... 
Vernita pulls the gun out of the cereal box and FIREES again... 
...The bullet HITS THE FLOOR of the tiny kitchen... 
...The Bride moves under the kitchen table, then using her back, LIFTS THE TABLE OFF THE GROUND, RAMMING IT STRAIGHT INTO Vernita, pinning her flat up against the table top, and the kitchen counter. 
While her left hand holds the table,    her right hand goes to the SOG on her belt, her fingers wrap    around the blade's grip, lifting it up out of the sheath    and PLUNGING IT THROUGH THE TABLE TOP up to the handle, with    all the SOG's steel entering Vernita's abdomen. 
The table falls back to the floor with the dying homemaker pinned to it. The two former colleagues meet eyes. 
VERNITA Sorry, bout the bushwhack. Please don't... 
THE BRIDE Do to your daughter, what you did to mine... (she takes her hand) ...I won't. 
Vernita dies. 
The Bride removes her Sog, looks up and sees little Nikki standing in the doorway of her room. The little girl sees her mother dead on the floor, lying in her own blood. And she sees the blonde lady standing over her mother, bloody knife still in her hand. But oddly enough, Nikki doesn't cry. The little girl locks eyes with the big girl, and holds her stare. 
As she    talks to the little girl, she removes an already stained    with blood white handkerchief with the name "BILL" sewn on    it. And the blonde wipes the girl's mother's blood off her    blade. 
THE BRIDE It was not my intention to do this in front of you. For that I'm sorry. But you can take my word for it, your mother had it coming. When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, I'll be waiting. 
And with that apology, statement, and invitation, The Bride walks out the kitchen side door, leaving the little girl to her mourning. 
EXT. VERNITA'S HOME - DAY 
The Bride walks down the dead woman's driveway to her vehicle. She glances at the lawn toys one more time as she makes here getaway. 
She climbs into her big, yellow pickup truck, with the words "Pussy Wagon" written across the flatbed's hatch door in a pimpy font. She takes out a ringed notebook and turns to a page that's headline reads; 
DEATH LIST FIVE 
On the pager are five names numbered going down the page written in red ink. 
The first name has a line drawn through it with black ink. 
The second name on the list is; 
VERNITA GREEN COBRA 
The Bride takes a black felt pen and draws a line through Vernita's name. Turns on the truck's engine and drives out of the residential district. 
FADE TO BLACK. OVER BLACK TITLE CARD:

The comatose Bride 
FADE UP ON 
CU The comatose Bride lying in her hospital bed, wide open unblinking sightless eyes, that constantly stare yet see nothing. The Bride is at the beginning of her comatose journey. 
A SUBTITLE APPEARS: under her face. 
"Five years and four months earlier in the city of El Paso, Texas" 
Although we're only in a tight CU, we can tell a few things: one, she's in her hospital room; two, she's alone; three, it's night; and four, one hellva RAINSTORM is pounding outside. 
EXT. EL PASO GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
The rain pisses down in buckets in front of the hospital... 
WHEN... 
The wheel to an Alfa Romeo rolls into FRAME and stops. 
The car door opens and two yellow galoshes step out into the wet night. 
OVERHEAD SHOT A red umbrella opens as rain falls down. 
CU the back of a head wearing a yellow rainslicker hood, framed by the red umbrella above it, which water cascades down and beats a rhythm against.

WE GO TO SPLIT SCREEN 
Left Side                   Right Side CU The Bride's unblinking        The back of the yellow comatose sleep.                  slicker - walking in the rain towards the hospital's entrance. 
CU her yellow galoshes slapping against the wet asphalt, and splashing through puddles.

INSERT:    A LITTLE WHITE NURSE'S    CAP IS PLACED ON TOP    of the woman's blonde    head. 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
The door marked "ladies" is opened, and a beautiful 6-foot blonde in a white nurse's uniform, with a matching white eye patch over her left eye, steps out, carrying the nurse's tray with the "Goodbye forever"-filled syringe on it. She walks down the corridor towards The sleeping Bride's room. 
CAMERA MOVES UP TO Orderly's face, leading two TRUCKDRIVERS. The Bride HEARS BILL'S VOICE SPEAK FOR THE ORDERLY; 
BILL'S VOICE                            ORDERLY (in time)                              (in time) She's right in here.                She's right in here. 
SPLIT SCREEN FINISHES STAY WITH The BRIDE'S SCREEN 
The Bride decides the best course    of action,    till she gets her bearings, is to play possum.    She throws    herself back down on the bed, just as the three men    enter her    room. They see just what they expected    to see, The    Bride lying in her bed in her coma. 
She duplicates her comatose eyes-wide-open-fixed stare. Except knowing she's awake, and sees everything in front of her, creates a slightly different effect. 
The Bride, however, while she sees the Two Truckdrivers for what they are, when she sees The Orderly she sees Bill, when The Orderly talks she hears Bill. WE HOWEVER WILL NEVER SEE BILL'S FACE COMPLETELY. 
The Orderly takes her shee covering off, and hitches up her hospital gown till her blonde pussy is exposed. He does kind of a "TA-DA" presentation of her vagina. 
THE ORDERLY Now is that the cutest little blonde pussy you ever saw, or is that the cutest little blonde pussy, YOU-EVEA-SAW? 
Trucker #2 (Gerald) would tend to agree, Trucker #1 (Warren) fronts. 
WARREN I seen better. 
CU The BRIDE EYES WIDE OPEN PLAYING POSSUM. She can't believe she's being exhibited in this manner. A look of chagrin crosses her trying-to-be expressionless face, "I've seen a fuck load better than you, fatass." 
THE ORDERLY Yeah, in a movie - maybe. But I know damn well this is the best pussy you ever saw you had touchin rights to. The price is seventy five dollars a fuck gentlemen, you gittin your freak on or what? 
The Truckers pay the bill of fare. 
As The Orderly counts The Truckers' money, he lays out the rules; 
THE ORDERLY Here's the rules; Rule    number one; no punchin 'er. Nurse comes in tomorrow    an she got 'er a shiner - or less    some teeth, jig's up. So no knuckle    sandwiches under no circumstances.    And by the 
way, this little cunt's a spitter - it's a motor reflex thing but spit or no, no punchin. Now are we absolutely positively clear about rule number one? 
TWO TRUCKERS Yeah. 
THE ORDERLY Rule number two; No monkey bites, no hickeys - in fact no leavin no marks of no kind. But after that, it's allll goooood. Her plummin down there don't work no more, so feel free to cum in 'er all ya wont. Keep the noise down - try not to make a mess, and I'll be back in twenty. 
The Orderly turns to leave, then remembers something, and turns back. He takes out the most disgusting jar of vaseline in the history of cinema, and hands it to Warren. 
THE ORDERLY Oh by the way, not all the time, but sometimes this cunt's cunt can get drier than a bucket of sand. If she dry, lube up with this and you'll be goo to go. BON-APPETIT, gentlemen. 
And with that, The Orderly's gone. 
The BRIDE'S POV: As soon as he leaves the Two Truckers start giggling. Warren begins to unbuckle the belt that lies beneath his belly. While he looks down to accomplish this, The BRIDE'S POV BLINKS. 
GERALD Hey Warren, she just blinked. 
WARREN He said she can't blink. 
GERALD I know what he said, I'm tellin ya 
she just did. 
Warren drops his Levi's to his ankles. 
WARREN Just wait, when I get through with this little dumbbell, she gonna stand up and recite the Gettysburg Ad-dress. 
Warren begins to climb up on the bed and mount The Bride. Before he does he stops, and looks back to Gerald. 
WARREN Hey, Gerald. 
GERALD Yeah? 
WARREN This shit ain't no peep show. Go out in the hall and I'll let ya know when it's your turn. 
GERALD Awww c'mon, I gotta leave the room? 
WARREN I can't get no errection wit you lookin at me, so go on. 
GERALD Well, just hurry up then. 
Gerald leaves the room; we go out with him in the hallway. 
INT. HALLWAY (HOSPITAL) - NIGHT 
Gerald paces, waiting for his turn behind the door. 
THEN... 
He hears behind the door a commotion, then Warren SCREAM LIKE A BITCH. He bangs on the closed door and says; 
GERALD He man, keep it down in there, I can hear your ass out here. 
More falsetto SCREAMS behind the door... 
THEN... 
The HEAVY THUD of a body falling. Not what the expected. 
INT. THE BRIDE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Gerald pushes open the door to see one hellva sight. His buddy, bloody and lying motionless on the floor, and The Bride lying haphazardly on the bed, in her coma. 
He moves to his buddy, who's dead. Then moves to The comatose Bride... Who SUDDENLY SPRINGS TO LIFE, GRABBING him by the front of his shirt, YANKING HIM DOWN TO HER, and PLUNGING the I.V. NEEDLE in her arm DEEP INTO HIS TEMPLE, THEN TWISTING IT AROUND and AROUND, turning the right side of his brain into scrambled eggs a la The BRIDE. She tosses the now brain-dead Gerald to the floor. 
The BRIDE upon waking, without leaving the bed    where she lay the last five years, has just killed two men.    She throws off the bloody blankets, whips her legs off    the side of the bed, and tries to stand - THEN QUICKLY FALLS    OUT OF FRAME. WE HEAR THE CRASH BELOW FRAME. 
The Bride is flat on the floor. Her legs and feet don't work. Which means she's stuck on the floor with only a functioning top half, and a completely useless bottom half. What's a girl to do? 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
The elevator doors open, and The Orderly steps out. 
BACK TO The BRIDE She hears the sound of Bill's boots approaching the room... STEP...STEP...STEP... 
She sees Gerald has a Trucker's knife in a holster attached to his belt. Her hands removes it. 
The Orderly swaggers down the hall to The Bride's room, red Reeboks slapping against the smooth floor. 
CU The BRIDE She SNAPS the knife's BLADE OPEN in her CU. 
The Orderly pushes open The Bride's door, stopping in shock. 
The ORDERLY'S POV: He sees an empty bed with bloodstains on it, Two dead Truckers on the floor, and no Bride. 
ORDERLY Oh shit! 
WE GO TO SLOW MOTION    as he freaks, Then PAN DOWN HIM... Past shirts - pants - to    his Reeboks...Once on the floor WE SEE The BRIDE, curled up    low next to the doorway, behind his ankles, knife ready.    WE GO BACK TO 24 FRAMES A SECOND. He steps into the room;    when he does The Bride reaches out and SLASHES both of his    Achilles tendons. 
The STANDING ORDERLY lets out a "YELP," adn FALLS OUT OF FRAME. 
IMPACT CUT The Orderly HITTING the floor face first. The boy is stunned. 
The BRIDE (Confined to the floor) crawls over and drags the stunned fucker across the floor, placing his melon head between the door and the door frame. Then taking the door in her right hand. 
SLAM! 
SLAM! 
SLAM! 
SLAMMING HIS HEAD THREE TIMES BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE DOOR FRAME. 
The ORDERLY lies on the floor in a stange state of consciousness. He's in both excruciating pain, and quite sure he's lost his mind, since at this moment he's lying on the floor, looking up at The comatose Bride asking him questions. 
THE BRIDE Where's Bill? 
THE ORDERLY (hurt and confused) Who? 
SLAM! 
He screams. 
THE BRIDE Bill! Where is Bill! 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) It was at that age, a half-Chinese, half-Japanese American Army brat witnessed the murder of her Master Sergeant father. And the rape, then murder of her mother at the hands of Japan's most ruthless Yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto. She swore revenge...luckily for her, Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile. 
SHOCK CUT O-REN ON TOP OF BOSS MATSUMOTO PLUNGING A HUGE KNIFE INTO HIS CHEST. A STREAM OF RED BLOOD SHOOTS UP OUT OF HIM like a geyser. Boss is naked, O-Ren wears a Japanese schoolgirl uniform. 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) At thirteen, she got her revenge. 
The Boss's screams cause TWO OF BOSS'S MEN to run into the room, only to be SHOT DOWN by O-Ren, as she removes a gun from a holster strapped to her thigh. 
The 20-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII on a rooftop with a high-powered, scope-sight rifle up to her eye. Her EYE is HUGELY MAGNIFIED in the SCOPE. 
THE BRIDE By twenty, she was one of the tip top of female assassins in the world. 
She fires. 
INT. CAR - DAY 
A Central American General riding backseat    of his government vehicle. TWO BEAUTIFUL LATIN WOMEN in one-   piece bathing suits sit on either side of him. They both wear    sashes down their front; one reads, "Miss Panama," the other    reads, "Miss Venezuela." As we cut to this shot, he has    both hands on each of their bare knees. He's laughing as the    TOP OF HIS HEAD is BLOWN OFF. 
The 23-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII stands before Bill and The Bride. (Bill is not clearly viewed.) 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) At twenty-three she joined Bill's Deadly Vipers... 
The 25-YEAR-OLD O-REN ISHII BEATING UP the pregnant Bride with the other Vipers...

She cries for all the innocent people at the wedding chapel, who died simply because they were unlucky enough to cross her path... 
She cries for the betrayal at the hands of her lover... 
She cries for the treachery at the hands of her comrades... 
She cries for the five years of life snatched from her... 
She cries for the countless violations she endured while incapacitated...

END OF MUSIC MONTAGE 
EXT./INT. BUCK'S TRUCK DRIVING IN DESERT (MOVING) - NIGHT 
POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD: The truck shines its headlight beams on an open patch of prairie wasteland. We see dirt, rocks, plants, and an oil derrick pumping up and down. 
The Bride thinks the restaurant so small it's almost hard to imagine there could be a back room to it. 
Before getting a response from whoever it was he was yelling to a moment ago, The Sushi Chef turns back to The Bride. 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) -- What other Japanese you learn? 
The Bride puts on a thinking face. 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) Oh...let's see..."Arigato." 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) "Arigato"...Very good. 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) ..."Ah-So"... 
SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE) "Ah-So!" You know what "Ah-So" meansß 
THE BRIDE "I See." 
SUSHI CHEF I see - Very good. 
THE BRIDE I already said "Domo", right? 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) Yes. 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) "Kon-netie-wa." 
The Sushi Chef goes "Oooh" like he's just discovered the answer to a mystery. 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) ..."Kon-nichi-wa"...repeat please. 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) "Kon-nichi-wa?" 
Saying with surprise and admiration; 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) Most impressive...you say Japanese words, like you Japanese. 
The Bride smiles and lets loose with a girlish giggle. 
THE BRIDE Now you're making fun of me. 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) No no no - serious business. Pronunciation - very good. You say "Arigato" ...like we say "Arigato." 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) Well, thank you - I mean...arigato. 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) You should learn Japanese - very easy. 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) No kidding, I heard it's kinda hard. 
Whenever the Sushi Chef doesn't either hear your or understand you, he yells the word; 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) What! 
And everybody always speaks LOUDER and CLEARER immediately afterwards. 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) I always heard it was difficult. 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) Yes yes yes - most difficult. But you have Japanese tongue. 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) Maybe I was Japanese in another life. 
The Sushi Chef proclaims as if he should know; 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) Most definitely, most definitely Japanese in another life. 
He sets an order of colorful, raw fish in front of the young blonde woman, that not only looks good, it looks beautiful. 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) How did you know tuna's my favorite? 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) What! 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) Tuna's my favorite. 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) Ah, thank you very much. 
He YELLS    OFFSCREEN in Japanese agai. A little BALD JAPANESE MAN with    a shitty attitude, comes out from the back room. He heads for    the tall blonde asking in a grumbly voice in Japanese,    "What she wants to drink?" 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) (to the bald man) I beg your pardon? 
The Sushi Chef pantomimes drinking. 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) - Drink - 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) Oh yes, a bottle of warm sake. 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) Ahhh sake, (he holds up his thumb) Very good. 
In Japanese he YELLS/ORDERS the warm sake, the little Bald Man disappears. The Bride takes a bite out of her fish. 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) First time in Japan? 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) A-huh. 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) What! 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) Yes, this is my first time. 
As the chef slices the next portion with a large knife, he asks; 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) What brings you to Okinawa? 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) I came to see a man. 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) Aaahh, you have friend live in Okinawa? 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) Not quite. 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) Not friend? 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) I've never met him. 
The Sushi Chef continues slicing..... 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) 
Who is he, may I ask? 
THE BRIDE Hattori Hanzo. 
There's a break in the Sushi Chef's slicing. After a beat, he brings a bloody finger INTO FRAME and sticks it in his mouth. 
The little Bald man appears with a bottle of warm sake, he pours one for The Bride, then disappears again. 
As The Bride sips the sake, she looks at the chef. 
As The Sushi Chef sucks his finger, he looks at The Bride. 
The Sushi Chef drops the voice he had been using up to that point...and IN JAPANESE SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH asks; 
SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE) What do you want with Hattori Hanzo? 
The Bride answers in Japanese; 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) I need Japanese steel. 
SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE) Why do you need Japanese steel? 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) I have vermin to kill. 
SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) You must have big rats you need Hattori Hanzo steel. 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) Huge. 
INT. HATTORI HANZO'S ATTIC - DAY 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) At the age of twenty, Bill backed his Nippon progeny financially and philosophically in her Shakespearian-in-magnitude power struggle with the other Yakuza clans, over who would rule vice in the city of Tokyo. 
Japamation images of O-Ren and her Army, taking on ANOTHER YAKUZA ARMY, among falling cherry blossoms. 
WE CUT BACK AND FORTH between cartoon images of this and the real life real McCoy samurai sword battle. 
O-Ren's ability is simply amazing. 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) When it was all over, it was the geisha-regaled O-Ren Ishii that proved the victor. 
INT. JAPANESE NIGHT CLUB 
O-Ren has just become the official leader of crime in the city of Tokyo. The six Yakuza clan bosses, each with TWO BODYGUARDS standing behind them, toast their new leader, with much laughter and drinking...all except one...BOSS TANAKA. 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) And just in case you're wondering how could a half breed Japanese Chinese American become the boss of all criminal activity in Tokyo, Japan,... I'll tell you. The subject of O-Ren's blood and nationality came up before the council only once. The night O-Ren assumed power over the crime council. 
Boss Tanaka is the picture of angered ambiance among the alcohol-fueled frivolity. 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) The man who seems bound and determined to break the mood is Boss Tanaka. And what Boss Tanaka thinks is... 
Boss Tanaka brings his fist down on the table, smashing the plate in front of him into itty bitty pieces. 
The party comes to a halt as all eyes go to the leader of the Tanaka Crime Family. 
CRIME FAMILY LEADER #2 (JAPANESE) Tanaka? What's the meaning of this outburst? This is a time for celebration. 
BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE) And what exactly should I be celebrating? The perversion of our illustrious council? 
The Bosses all react with shock and outrage...O-Ren remains cool. She raises her voice for the first word, but lowers it for the rest of the sentence. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) Gentlemen...Boss Tanaka obviously has something on his mind. Allow him to express it. 
BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE) My father... (looking at a clan head) ...along with yours and... (looking at another) ...along With yours, started this council. And while you drink like fish and laugh like donkeys, they weep in the afterlife over the perversion committed today. 
The BOSSES react again...O-Ren; 
O-REN (JAPANESE) 
Silence! (then composed) Of what perversion do you speak, Tanaka? 
Boss Tanaka looks at the female half-breed American and says; 
BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE) I speak, Mistress Ishii,....of the perversion done to this council, which I love more than my own children,...by making a half Chinese American its leader. 
Then... 
Faster than you can say Jimminy Cricket,... 
O-Ren's samurai sword is unsheathed... 
Boss Tanaka's head is liberated from its body... 
The head hits the floor... 
And from the spot between its shoulder blades, a geyser of blood shoots up in the air. 
The BOSSES who were shocked at Tanaka's words are even more flabbergasted at O-Ren's resonse. 
The two bodyguard's, standing behind Boss Tanaka, hands go to their swords and draw them. 
O-Ren turns her blade in their direction. 
The Bosses and their bodyguards say nothing,...only watch. 
The lady looks across at the two men and says in and authoritative voice; 
O-REN (JAPANESE) Fight me or work for me. 
They look at her for a moment, then they lower their swords. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) Drop them on the ground. 
They do. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) Get behind me. 
They do. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) Get on your knees. 
They do. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) Put your foreheads on the floor. 
They do. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) Keep your mouths shut. 
You better believe they do. 
The mistress' eyes got to the other bosses looking at her. 
As she speaks English, bodyguard translators translate for their bosses. 
O-REN I'm going to say this in English so you know how serious I am. As your leader, I encourage you to -- from time to time and always in a respectful manner, and with the complete knowledge that my decision is final -- to question my logic. If you're unconvinced a particular plan of action I've decided is the wisest, tell me so. But allow me to convince you. And I will promise you, right here and now, no subject will be taboo...except the subject that was just under discussion. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) (to a bodyguard) Hand me that head. 
He picks it off the floor and meekly offers it to the Queen. 
She takes it by the hair and holds it up as she speaks. 
O-REN (ENGLISH) 
The price you pay for bringing up either my Chinese or my American heritage as a negative is, I collect your fuckin head. (now completely American) Just like this fucker here. Now if any of you sonsabitches got anything else to say, now's the fuckin time. 
Nobody says anything. 
O-REN (ENGLISH) I didn't think so. (pause) Meeting adjourned. 
EXT. THE HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES - JAPANESE RESTAURANT 
The entire O-Ren Ishii crew moves through the restaurant. The CUSTOMERS all look up now as the crew passes. The restaurant staff acts as if the Shogun himself has just showed up on their doorstep demanding a meal. No doubt if the meal is not satisfactory the staff will gladly slice off a finger. The door to a private dining room is slid open, the crew steps inside, the door is slid shut. 
INT. PRIVATE DINING AREA (RESTAURANT) - NIGHT 
The private dining area of the Japanese restaurant. The patrons are surrounded by white paper walls. The CAMERA CIRCLES around O-REN ISHII. 
Sitting in between her, two personal bodyguards, the Yubari sisters, YUKI AND GO GO. The Yubari sisters are younger than O-Ren; Yuki is sixteen and Go Go is seventeen. Both girls are dressed in Japanese schoolgirl uniforms complete with plaid skirts and matching blazers. 
FLASH ON EX CU OF AN EYEBALL (The BRIDE's) 
On her right is her French and Japanese lawyer, SOFIE FATALE. 
FLASH ON EX CU OF AN EYEBALL 
The bunch of mop-topped young men, who all wear black suits, white shirts, thin black ties and Kato masks over their eyes, are her soldiers, "The CRAZY 88." 
FLASH ON EX CU OF AN EAR, The Bride's fingers come into FRAME and move blonde hair out of the sensory appendage's way. 
And finally there's a tall dark American in a black suit sans Kato mask -- that's O-Ren's head of security, MR. BARREL. 
They're all drinking and having a good time as Sofie tells a joke in Japanese. 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) The mop tops in black suits and Kato masks were O-Ren's soldiers, "The Crazy 88." The two young girls in the schoolgirl uniforms are her personal bodyguards, the Yubari sisters. Yuki, aged sixteen, and Go Go, aged seventeen. The pretty lady who's dressed like she's a villain on Star Trek is O-Ren's best friend and her lawyer, Sofie Fatale. And finally, the American in the black suit but sans Kato mask, O-Ren's head of security, Mr. Barrel. 
SUDDENLY O-Ren hears something. Like a deer in the forest, her head springs up on alert. It's almost as if she's listening to The Bride's narration. 
The Bride's NARRATION SUDDENLY STOPS IN MIDSENTENCE -- 
O-Ren removes a SMALL DAGGER-DART from the folds of her robe and THROWS IT in the direction of the sound. 
CU The BRIDE dressed in a kimono on the other side of the private dining room's paper wall. The DART FLIES THROUGH The PAPER, STREAKS BY HER FACE, almost taking off the tip of her nose in the process. 
EX CU The EYES of The Bride, pointed down at the bodies by her feet, 
...BEAT 
...they Look back up at O-Ren. 
O-REN standing in between Go Go and Mr. Barrel. Her eyes narrow. 
The BRIDE swipes the air with her sword, the blood of the dead attackers flies off. 
GO GO and MR. BARREL unsheath their swords. 
WHEN... 
We hear a LOUD SOUND of many ENGINES behind the Bride. Then behind her, through the broken pictures window we see seventeen motorcycles pull up to the parking lot. All the riders wear black suits with kato masks, and all carry samurai swords. 
The BRIDE looks from the reinforcements to O-Ren. 
O-REN smiles. 
O   -REN (ENGLISH) (to the     Bride) You didn't     think it was going to be that easy,     did you? 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) (to O-Ren) You know, for a second there, yeah I did. 
O-Ren smiles... 
O-REN (ENGLISH) Silly rabbit... 
Both O-Ren and the Bride finish the phrase together,... 
O-REN/THE BRIDE ...Trix Are for kids. 
This is something they used to say back when they fought alongside of each other as "Vipers." 
The seventeen Crazy 88 reinforcements come running into the restaurant and with drawn swords surround The Bride. 
As a HEAVY METAL COMBAT BEAT begins to PULSATE ON THE SOUNDTRACK, The Boys and The Bride have a Spaghetti Western Stand-off. 
We do a 360 INSIDE the CIRCLE of The Crazy 88, who surround the yellow-haired warrior. Not all have Samurai swords; one JUGGLES TWO HATCHETS, another TWIRLS A THREE-STAFF TRIPLE IRON over his head. 
As the Heavy Metal music builds...We Cut to various Shots of The Two Opposing Forces Preparing to Strike....Hands on Sword Handles...Feet finding Combat Stance...etc... 
....Until Heavy Metal reaches its Breaking Point... 
...At that point, the Metal EXPLODES OVER THE SOUNDTRACK...IN TIME WITH The BRIDE EXPLODING INTO A VIOLENT KILLING MACHINE ON SCREEN. 
As she matches skill with the army of black-suited boys, arms flailing, silver blade Clashing and Slashing, long blonde hair whipping like a whirling dervish.... ...She's a Goddess of War Venus. 
Not only is the FIGHT CUT TO THE HEAVY METAL MUSIC, but The Bride seems to be somewhat dancing to it as she fights. 
This explosion of furious violence is punctuated CINEMATICALLY BY THE COLOR IN THE FILM POPPING OFF, and the fight being filmed in HIGH CONTRAST BLACK AND WHITE, turning the squirting, spewing geysers of BLOOD FROM CRIMSON RED TO OIL BLACK. 
Many members of The Crazy 88 are Sliced, Slashed, and liberated from the limbs they were born with at The Bride's blade. 
Some SPECIFIC MOMENTS 
While Clashing swords, The Bride whips the silver Boomerang out of its holster, and Throws it... 
....It Twirls Through the Air... 
...Embedding itself longways in one of the boy's faces. 
The Bride does a Mid-Air Somersault over the head of an Attacker, landing solid on her feet behind him...Slash, he's Out. 
The Bride is knocked to the floor, her Attacker stands over her to Spear the young blonde, Her Legs Spring Up In The Air, Ankles Lock Around The Boy's Neck. 
She throws him down to the ground. With his neck still in the vise-like grip of her ankles, She removes The SOG Knife from its sheath and Plunges it Deep Into The Boy's Chest. 
While still on the ground, an Attacker Charges at her. Yanking the Boomerang out of the Dead Boy's Face, She Sends It Flying in the Charging Man's path... 
...Boomerang Twirling Through the Air Close to the Ground... 
...Chopping Off the Charging Attacker's Foot in Mid Step, he falls flat. 
The Bride jumps up onto an attacker's shoulders. She locks her legs around him so he's helpless at shaking her off. 
...she swings down with her sword, and cuts the man's hands off. 
So while the helpless man with no hands screams, the now nine foot tall Bride fights with the others. 
When she's through she brings the blade across the man she's perched on's throat. He falls to his knees, bringing the Bride back to the floor like an alevator. 
As soon as her soles touch ground, she's off his shoulders, somersaulting on the floor, bringing her blade up between an attacker's legs into his groin. 
He lets out a scream, as she yanks her blade free. 
ONE ATTACKER steps out from the rest, "The Best One." He Twirls his sword expertly, challenging the young woman to, "Come get a piece." 
The Bride does a screaming charge towards him.... ...Sword raised, The Attacker stands his ground, calm - steady, waiting for the blonde-haired locomotive to 
collide.....They meet..... 
SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE - SWING - CLASH - SPIN - CLASH - LOCK - TWIRL - SEPARATE - 
They match each other blow for blow, till one makes a mistake. It's the male. The Bride's swing, that's neither clashed or blocked, slices off his right arm. 
...The arm, still gripping the samurai sword, drops to the floor. 
The Bride pushes the Hanzo Sword right through the middle of his chest. 
Only half of the Crazy 88s that started the fight remain alive, or intact...They start to approach...The Bride, still holding the sword that's still impaling the skilled Attacker, backs up, keeping his body between her and the remaining killers. 
Like a boxer, The Bride uses the momentary break in the action, to rest on her feet.....THEN...yanks the blade from his chest cavity....The Body Twitches - Spasms - Grunts and Crashes to the floor. 
The Attackers start to close in...The Bride readies herself for their attack....THEN (in perfect time with the Heavy Metal)...Drops to the floor on her back, Spinning like a top. She Swings and Slashes and Cuts down below at their legs and feet, like some hellish samurai sword-weilding turtle flipped over on its shell.... 
Many black-suited, mask-wearing boys drop to the ground. 
...Still Spinning like a break dancer, she spins up on top of her head, and Pops back up on her feet. 
And then there were seven. 
The seven remaining sword-weilding, black-suited boys moved out of range of the Bride's blade when she dropped to the floor. Now spread out, they make a large half-circle. 
The Bride, slowly points the tip of her blade to the floor, lowers herself to one knee and slightly bows her head. In repose. 
EX CU The Bride's eyes pointed up, watch them move closer, COLOR COMES BACK INTO THE FILM. We see her face is splashed with blood. 
O-REN WHIPS OPEN a red fan. 
GO GO stands by the restaurant's junction box, she flips the switch. 
The room goes dark. 
The Crazy 7 make a wide circle around the blonde who's still on the floor.... 
...Looking down on her breathing hard in the shadows. As she breathes in and out, The FACE OF A LIONESS IS SUPERIMPOSED OVER HER FACE. 
Breathe in (Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) - Breathe in (Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) ..... 
The Bride rises to her feet... 
The Crazy 7 move in a circle around The Bride, she moves in a circle inside of their circle, all eight of them move in rhythm with the Metal... 
The Heavy Metal Music builds....to a big finish...THEN both Music and The Bride Explode! 
WIDE SHOT - FRAMED LIKE A KABUKI STAGE With the lights off, The White paper wall the eight killers fight in front of turns a Psychedelic Bright Blue. The snow falling outside is reflected against the paper wall like black snow falling on a blue shadow puppet stage. 
The eight samurais are Black Silhouettes against the blue backdrop. They begin to combat in a dance of blood, steel and death. The Bride does a sword-weilding dosey-doe with all sword-weilding partners. 
She CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASHES with all of them - They seperate - stalk each other for a moment to the beat - then CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASH again, with The Bride killing or hacking the limbs of one unlucky dance partner at each encounter - Sometimes during the separation, The Bride crouches down low in repose while the others continue to circle stalk...THEN...She Strikes again. 
We Cut in closer whenever we need to. 
O-REN ISHII Screams at her "...last line of defense;" 
O-REN (ENGLISH) What are you waiting for? Are you on a date? Attack her you fool! 
THE BRIDE Oh my God... (pause) ...She just called you a fool. She just called you a fool in front of me. Not only am I your opponent. I'm a female fellow countryman. And you're going to risk your life - to say nothing of harming me - for a woman who refers to you as a fool? 
O-REN is furious, and slaps Mr. Barrel on the shoulder. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) Attack, Goddamn you! 
The Bride acts like she's embarrassed to witness what she just saw. 
Mr. Barrel spins in O-Ren's direction shooting her a look she's never seen from him before. 
He then looks back to the Bride. 
Her eyes are waiting for his. She says with just the slightest hint of plea in her voice; 
THE BRIDE I'll owe ya one. 
He looks at her a BEAT longer...then says as he resheaths his sword; 
MR. BARREL The things I do for a pretty face. 
INSERT: The Blade sliding back down into the Sheath, The Handle locks into place with a Click. 
He looks back over his shoulder at his former Mistress, and says; 
MR. BARREL (JAPANESE) I quit. 
O-Ren fries and egg on her head. 
Then   with his sheathed Sword    in his right hand, and his left hand   in his pants pocket, he    walks across the carnage-strewn room   and out the front door.    As he walks, when he's parallel with   the Bride, He stops and    says; 
MR. BARREL About that one you owe me. 
THE BRIDE Yes? 
MR. BARREL I'm gonna collect someday, you know? 
THE BRIDE I'll be disappointed if you don't. 
He continues walking without a look back. Before he Exits the restaurant, he throws a look in Sofie's direction, Who's lying minus her arm in a pool of her own blood, and says; 
MR. BARREL Tough luck bout that arm Sofe. 
He exits the Movie. 
O-REN and The BRIDE match eyes. The Japanese gal says; 
O-REN (ENGLISH) Very funny. (pause) Your instrument is quite impressive. 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) Domo. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) Where was it made? 
THE BRIDE Okinawa. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) Whom in Okinawa made you this steel? 
THE BRIDE This is Hattori Hanzo steel. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) YOU LIE!! 
The Bride just smiles at her rival's response. 
O-Ren's composure returns. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) Swords however never get tired. I hope you've saved your energy. If you haven't, you might not last five minutes. (pause) 
Have you seen the garden in this establishment? 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) No. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) Oh, you really should. It's quite beautiful. Allow me. 
O-Ren moves out of the position she's stood in for the entire battle. She steps on the doormat of a corpse, that serves the same purpose of a bottom step, and moves over to the white paper wall and slides it open....REVEALING.... 
.....A WHITE WINTER WONDERLAND, set against a Jet Black sky. A Snow-covered Japanese Garden awaits right outside. Snow falls from the sky (Slightly artificial, not phony - but Operatic/Theatrical). O-Ren stands next to the Bride in the doorway looking out into the white night. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) As last looks go, you could do worse. 
The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld steps outside... 
The Bride follows her... 
INT. SNOW-COVERED JAPANESE GARDEN - NIGHT 
As snow falls around them, they stand the correct distance from one another. 
COMBAT MUSIC BEGINS PLAYING, but not Japanese drums - Spanish Flamenco Guitar....... 
The Bride Unsheaths her Sword Quickly...Holding it out in front of her...Tip of Blade pointed at O-Ren...Sword's Handle and her Fingers wrapped around that handle, up by her cheek...Her eyes are Reflected on the Blade...Snow falls around her. 
O-Ren begins walking forward towards the Bride...She raises up her Sword, still in its sheath, in front of her face vertically...then begins slowly unsheathing it...Snow falls around her. 
O-REN'S FEET White socks in wooden clogs, walk forward, Crunching Snow underneath them... 
The BRIDE Holding Sword...Eyes reflected in Blade...her Yellow Sneakers Crunching snow underneath them... 
O-REN when her Sword is fully unsheathed, the Japanese combat artist holds both arms straight out at her sides, Sword in one hand - Wood sheath in the other, like a bird.... 
....The Two Women circle each other.... 
They SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...CIRCLE...SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE... 
O-REN LEAPS in the air does a Somersault over the Bride's head, landing behind her opponent. She brings her Sword down in a Slashing Swing... 
SLASHING The BRIDE across her back - Spinning her around... 
O-Ren goes in for the kill...The Bride meets her blade... The Blades Clash and Lock...The Two Women's faces come together as the Blades become entangled... 
O-Ren moves her arm in a counter-clockwise motion that loosens the grip enough to bring her sword handle hard into The Bride's mouth... 
Knocking her backwards over a small, stone bench - Flat on her ass in a koi pond. 
- The Combat Guitar Stops - 
O-Ren doesn't charge the fallen blonde, She laughs; 
O-REN (ENGLISH) Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords. Bill might of humored you, but you will find neither humor nor mercy at my blade. Now unless you intend to commit sepeku among the koi, stand up and fight. You may not be able to fight like a samurai, but you can at least die like a samurai. 
The Combat Guitar starts again...As The Bride slowly rises out of the koi pond. She brings up her sword and Says Calmly to O-Ren in Japanese; 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) Attack me. With everything you have. 
The Two Women Clash Swords furiously, their attack ends with 
The Bride's Striking O-Ren - not fatally - but deep. They separate... 
...breathing hard...Cold Air coming out of their mouths like two locomotives... 
O-Ren looks down to her wound, then back up to The Bride. The respect for the Bride's ability is transparent. 
The Two Women Circle Stalk each other again... 
Red Blood running down Yellow Legs onto Yellow Sneakers... 
Wooden Clogs crunching the Snow, Blood trail dripping down legs staining White Socks with Red... 
They Attack, the Geisha figurine and The tall western girl with the mane of Whipping Blonde Hair. They Swing - Twist - Turn - Clash, matching blow for blow till they both back off. 
Both Women are out of breath and have    to stop to recuperate. As they both drink the harsh cold air    into their lungs, leaving red blood stains in the white    snow, the two females have the same thought. The next clash    will be their last. 
The Bride, runs across lawns and hides behind parked cars on the street, as the bullets rip up homes, lawns, and automobiles. 
When Yuki's car reaches the end of the dead end,... 
She jerks the wheel... 
SPINNING the car around, pointing it in the opposite direction. 
SHE HITS THE GAS AGAIN... 
SHE PULLS THE MACHINE GUN TRIGGER AGAIN... 
BULLETS TEAR UP the cars lining the street. 
In the hail of bullets, the Bride tries to fire back. 
Yuki reaches the end of the street and spins the car around. 
She gets ready to make a third pass. 
Some PEOPLE in the house behind the Bride, look out of their front door. 
The Bride yells at them; 
THE BRIDE Stay in your house and stay down on the floor! 
Yuki speeds after her, but this time she pops the curb and drives across the front lawns on the street heading right for her. 
The Bride runs into the house she's in front of. 
She runs through the living room, to the kitchen and the back door, but the kitchen's where the family that lives here is hiding and they block the door. 
Yuki's sports car pulls up in front of the house. She stands up in the convertible. Takes out a grenade, pulls the pin and says; 
YUKI (JAPANESE) Time for the rabbit to come out of her hole! 
She lobs the grenade up on the porch, then throws herself face down on the lawn. 
The porch and the front of the house explodes into splinters. 
Everybody in the kitchen is blown back. 
Realizing there's no getting out of the back door, the Bride runs back into the living room that's now missing a wall, and runs up the home's staircase leading to the bedrooms. 
Yuki steps into the house, sub-machine gun in hand... 
The Bride makes it to the top of the stairs, and is just about to disappear behind the upstairs hallway wall... 
WHEN... 
Yuki fires up at her, hitting her twice in the leg. 
The upstairs hallway, two bedroom doorways line both sides of the hallway. The Bride crashes to the floor -- SCREAMING -- blood pours out of her gunshots. 
Yuki charges up the stairs...machine gun blazing, tearing up the house. 
The Bride aims her 9mm where she expects Yuki to emerge. 
Yuki gets to the top of the stairs, and steps into the hallway. 
The Bride fires... 
The Bride's bullet wings Yuki in the left breast, knocking her through a bedroom doorway. 
THE BRIDE (to herself) Gotcha! 
Yuki screams like a little girl at the pain. She yells from the doorway into the hallway; 
YUKI (JAPANESE) You fucking bitch! You shot me in my breast! They're not fully developed yet, you fucking asshole! Now I'm always gonna have a dimple! 
The Bride answers Yuki back with an imitation of Yuki's giggle, which makes the youngin blow her top. 
YUKI (JAPANESE) Piss me off! 
She fires her machine gun around the corner, tearing up everything around the Bride. 
When the young girl stops firing, the Bride yells; 
THE BRIDE    (JAPANESE) Yuki, in about two    minutes there's going to be an army    of police here. So if you're gonna    kill me, now's the time. 
From her hiding place, Yuki snorts a line of baby blue powder. It gives her energy. 
THE BRIDE (O.S., ENGLISH) So what's it gonna be bitch? 
Slapping a new clip in her machine gun. 
YUKI (JAPANESE) That fucking does it! 
Yuki comes around the corner FIRING her machine gun in the 
Bride's direction, ripping up everything around her. 
The Bride lying flat on the floor fires her 9mm. 
The explosion of ammo creates the hysteria of warfare combat. 
Yuki charges the Bride, Kamakazi style. 
Three more bullets rip into the Bride, the Bride fires up at Yuki, hitting her three times in the body, knocking her off her feet, and sending her tumbling down the stairs. 
The Bride shot up, pulls herself to the top of the stairs. She sees Yuki lying at the bottom, dead. 
Yuki's face, dead,    eyes closed...then they pop up open... Guess what...she's    not dead. Though she's bloody and her schoolgirl uniform    is filled with bullet holes she rises. Her head turns in the    direction of the Bride... 
The Bride sees this and can't believe it... 
They lock eyes... 
...Yuki, who no longer has the machine gun, takes out a deadly looking knife and snaps it open with a smile that builds to a scream... 
She charges up the steps at the Bride. 
The startled Bride fires at her...the 9mm's empty... 
Yuki charging up the steps, yelling, knife raised high... 
The Bride, hurriedly removes the pistol she keeps in her ankle holster. 
Yuki chargin... 
The Bride cocks back the hammer... 
...Yuki charging, getting closer... 
The Bride FIRES 
Bullet hits Yuki, stops her for a quarter of a second, but she keeps charging... 
The Bride fires again... 
Yuki jerks but keeps on charging... 
Bride fires... 
Yuki jerks, but keeps charging... 
Bride fires... 
Yuki jerks, keeps chargin, almost at her, knife raised high... 
The Bride FIRES 
Yuki jerks, but keeps charging, knife ready to do its duty... 
A FEMALE VOICE FROM OFF SCREEN says to the Doorman; 
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Open the door Alburt, let's see what this Bill looks like. 
The door opens revealing BILL to the other side of the door, and for the first time, to the audience. He looks cool. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Bill looks inside and sees a fancy hotel room converted into a crap game. A crap table has been erected in the middle of the suite. SEVEN MEN stand around the table trying their luck. All playing has stopped at the opening of the door. 
One woman in a beautiful black dress, stands at the head of the table...It's her game...her name is L.F. O'BOYLE. 
Bill stands in the doorway. ALBURT the doorman, who wears a 
tux, waits for L.F.'s word. 
L.F. O'BOYLE Are you a policeman, Bill? 
BILL Not anymore? 
L.F. laughs. 
L.F. Let him play, Alburt. 
Bill steps inside and the game continues in earnest. 
L.F. (to the players) We now return to the game already in progress. The point is nine gentlemen, nine is the point... 
As Alburt    frisks him, Bill takes in the room. There are five other men    all wearing black tuxedos, all carrying samurai swords (as    is Alburt), all working for Miss O'Boyle. In his hand Bill    holds his sheathed Hanzo sword. Referring to the sword; 
ALBURT I'll take that. 
BILL You'll have to. 
The two men stare... 
L.F. Now now boys...Mr. Bill, do you intend to start any shit with that sword? 
BILL I give you my word of honor, I will start nothing. 
L.F. Good enough for me. (back to game) 
ALBURT Miss O'Boyle required a two-hundred dollar membership fee. 
BILL That's rather pricey. 
ALBURT You wanna play for free, go to Vegas. You start now you'll be there by sundown. 
Bill takes out a roll of bills that would choke a rodeo bull to death. He peels off two hundred. 
BILL I think I'll stay here. I'm thirsty. 
ALBURT That way. 
Bill walks over to the suite's bar, a YOUNG WOMAN tends it. 
BILL Beer. 
BARTENDER Twenty dollars. 
BILL Twenty dollars for a beer? 
BARTENDER High cost of living shooter. You don't like it, go to Vegas. You can 
get a prime rib dinner there for 
BILL What am I going to do, I'm thirsty. (throws a 20 on the bar) Pour the beer. 
The Bartender produces a dixie cup, and a can of Budweiser. She pops the top and fills the cup, leaving half of the beer inside the can. She then offers only the cup to Bill. 
BILL (pointing to the can) I don't get that? 
The Bartender slowly shakes her head, no. 
He lifts the dixie cup to his lips, and says; 
BILL Cheers. 
Bill approaches the table with his dixie cup of beer. 
L.F. Gentlemen, let's    see if the new kid in school wants    to play right away. (to Bill) How bout it new    kid, you wanna handle my bones,    or do you just like to watch? 
Dropping his money roll on the table... 
BILL I came to play. 
Color L.F. impressed. 
L.F. Boys take a look at this man, he's what Webster's calls, a gambler. The dice belong to you , sir. 
With her table stick, she pushes the dice to Bill. He takes them and inspects them. 
L.F. I hope you're not implying anything, friend? 
BILL (as he inspects dice) I'm not implying anything. 
Alburt starts to move from his position by the door. 
ALBURT That did it fuckhead, you're out the door -- 
L.F. motions him back to his position. 
The players watch L.F. And Bill, an opposite ends of the table, trade quips. 
Bill looks from the dice to L.F. 
BILL You looked me over when I stood in your doorway. I'm looking you over as I step up to your table. If I don't know, I don't throw. 
L.F. Are you satisfied? 
BILL More or less. 
L.F. I think we're getting into a antagonistic relationship. 
BILL Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were trying to take my money, and I was trying to take yours. 
L.F. It's just a game. 
Bill throws ten thousand dollars on the table, the room reacts. 
BILL If you're game, take my bet sportsman. 
L.F. Covered. 
Bill smiles as he rolls the dice in his hand, then throws...7...The room reacts...L.F. smiles and pushes the money and the dice back to Bill with her stick. He picks up his winnings, tosses them back on the table, and says; 
BILL Shoot it all. 
The room reacts. 
L.F. Covered. 
He holds the dice in his fist...and throws...5... 
L.F. The point is five, gentlemen, five is the point. 
Bill throws...5...more reaction...more money... 
BILL Shoot it all. 
L.F. Covered. 
He shoots again, he wins again... 
L.F. O'Boyle hides in her room, holding a gun, pointed at the front door. 
She sits in bushwhack mode, waiting for Bill, or anybody for that matter, to step through the doorway. 
WHEN... 
The window her back is up against SHATTERS, and a black gloved hand reaches inside and GRABS her by her hair, and YANKS her out the window. 
EXT. HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT 
Bill on the ledge of the hotel window (the 26th floor), outside L.F. O'Boyle's room. 
He's yanked her outside and he's dangling her over the side by her hair. 
BILL Do you know a Jessica? 
L.F. Is too hysterical to answer. 
BILL Well, she knows you. 
He drops her...... 
............... SHE FALLS.... 
...................................SHE SPLATS. 
Bill watches her all the way down. When he's confident her fall was fatal, he leaves the ledge. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
BLACK FRAME TITLE CARD: 
Chapter seven 
"The lonely grave of Paula Schultz" 
EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER - DAY 
A small camper trailer sits all by its lonesome in the middle of a barren Texas wasteland. 
A SUBTITLE APPEARS under this image; 
"The city of Austin Texas." 
A fist knocks on the trailer door. 
It opens, revealing    Bill's    brother, BUDD. Not the Slick Willie Budd with the    black    suit and the silver-tipped black cowboy boots we saw    earlier    at the wedding chapel massacre. No, the Budd we see    now is    the Budd who climbed into a bottle five years ago, got    himself    comfortable, and decided to live there. 
Bill, looking like    a cool million, stands out in the dirt and dust of Budd's lot    of land, looking up at his brother in his natural habitat. In    the B.G. we can see Elle Driver lounging in the passenger's    seat. 
Budd, surprised by the visitor, says; 
BUDD Great day in the morning. Brother Bill livin up to his familia obligation. 
BILL How ya doin' Budd? 
BUDD Oh, you know my life, Bill, just a mad rush of wild parties and wealthy women. 
Budd squints into the sun at the woman in Bill's ear. 
BUDD Is that that tall blonde one-eyed Viking bitch in the passenger seat? 
BILL It's Elle. Want to say hello? 
BUDD Never said "bye," can't seem to think of a reason to say, "hi." 
INSERT: INT. - BILL'S CAR 
Elle inside, blasting both the stereo and the air conditioner. She watches the brotherly scene play out through the car windshield. Obviously there's no love lost between Elle and Budd. 
BUDD What'd ya wanna talk about? 
BILL Are you not going to invite me in? 
BUDD No. 
BILL May I ask why not? 
BUDD It stinks in there, that's why. Now what's so important it requires a reunion? 
TIME CUT 
The estranged brothers continue their conversation. Budd sits in the doorway of his trailer, bottle of jack in his hand. Bill stands. 
BUDD You tryin to tell me she cut her way through eighty-eight bodyguards 'fore she got to O-Ren? 
BILL No. There wasn't really eighty eight of them, they just called themselves The Crazy 88. 
BUDD Why. 
BILL 
I dunno, I guess they thought it sounded cool. Anyhow, she had about 26 or 27 around her when (BLEEP) attacked. They all fell under her Hanzo sword. 
The mention of a Hattori Hanzo sword gets Budd's attention. 
BUDD She got 'er a Hattori Hanzo sword? 
Bill nods his head, "yes." 
BILL She has a Hanzo Jingi sword. 
BUDD He made her one? Didn't he swear a blood oath never to make another sword? 
BILL It would appear he's broken it. 
Budd doesn't say anything at first...THEN; 
BUDD Them Japs know how to carry a grudge don't they? Or is it just you tend to bring that out in people? 
BILL (pause) I know this is a ridiculous question before I ask, but you by any chance haven't kept up with your swordplay? 
BUDD Hell, I pawned that years ago. 
BILL You pawned a Hattori Hanzo sword? 
BUDD Yep. 
The disrespect is pain. 
BILL It was priceless. 
BUDD Not in El Paso it ain't. In El Pso I got me 250 Dollars for it. 
BILL Since it was a gift from me, why didn't you offer me the chance to buy it back? 
BUDD Because that would've required me to acknowledge your existence. Drunken bum though I may be, I don't need booze that bad. But who the hell gives a crap anyway. That bitch ain't gittin no Bushido points for killin a white trash piece of shit like me with a samurai sword. I'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill. If she wants to fight me, all she gotta do is come down to the Club, start some shit, and we'll be in a a fight. 
BILL -- Budd, you need to listen to me. I know we haven't spoken for quite some time, and the last time we spoke wasn't the most pleasant. But you need to get over being mad at me, and start becoming afraid of Bea. Because she is coming, and she's coming to kill you. And unless you accept my assistance, I have no doubt she will succeed. 
Budd sees Bill's true concern for his welfare. 
Bill tries to charm his brother. 
BILL Can't we forget the past, and look at the happy side of all this? 
Budd chuckles. 
BUDD And what would that happy side be? 
BILL She's brought "the boys" back together. 
Budd is touched by Bill's concern and chuckles to himself. 
The BRIDE standing in the doorway is HIT SMACK DAB in the chest, and PROPELLED THROUGH the AIR BACKWARDS. 
Landing hard on her back in the dirt. 
Budd casually rises from his rocking chair and lifts the needle off the phonograph, cutting off the music. 
Then with shotgun in hand, stands in the doorway of the trailer looking down at The Bride. 
BUDD'S POV: The Bride laid out in the dirt below him -- Sword separated from her grasp -- Bloody mess down her front -- Groan from her throat. 
Budd steps down from the trailer onto the dirt, standing over The Bride. 
BUDD Bet your sweet ass that don't sting like a bitch. 
More groans coming out of The blood splattered Bride. 
BUDD 
You done got a double dose of rock salt, right in the ole tit. Now not havin tits as fine or as big as yours, I can't even imagine how bad that shit stings... 
He lowers down on his haunchers, over her. 
BUDD ...But I don't wont to neather. 
The Bride, hurting and incapacitated from the shotgun blast, still nevertheless defiant, SPITS a gob of bloody saliva, right in ole Budd's face. 
Budd, gob of spit running down on his cheek and nose. The cowboy removes a red bandana from his back pocket, and wipes away the goo. Then his eyeballs go down to the spitter. 
BUDD Now I know when it    comes to a rock salt burn, you're    feelin pretty much like a expert    bout now. But truth be told, you    ain't felt all rock salt's got to    offer till you took a double dose    in your backside. 
With the help of his cowboy boot he rolls The Bride over onto her stomach, exposing her butt. 
SNAPPING the barrel closed, he takes aim and FIRES both barrels -- EXECUTION STYLE -- right into her keister. 
The Bride does the one thing she has yet to do with any opponent during the movie up till now. Her head rears back and she lets out a SCREAM! 
BUDD That gentled ya down, didn't it? Yep...ain't nobody a badass with two barrels of rock salt dug deep in their backyard. 
THEN... 
Almost mercifully, the man once known as "Sidewinder," sticks a syringe in her arm, dropping her unconscious. 
THEN... 
Knocking down a swig of Jack Daniels, he removes a small silver cell phone from his pants pocket, raises the antenna, and presses one button on the panel. 
INT. ELLE DRIVER'S GYM - NIGHT 
The six-foot tall, long-haired blonde with the codename "California Mountain Snake," is doing a savage boxing workout with her COACH. 
This is one white bitch who can kick some serious FUCKIN ass. With one mighty blow from her huge right arm (synched to the sound of a CAR CRASH), her boxing Coach buys the farm. 
Elle on cell phone. We cut Back and Forth. 
ELLE Bill? 
BUDD Wrong brother, you hateful bitch. 
ELLE ....Budd? 
BUDD Bingo. 
ELLE And what do I owe this dubious pleasure? 
BUDD I just caught me the cowgirl, ain't never been caught. 
This gets Elle's attention. 
ELLE Do you mean what I think you mean? 
BUDD If you think I mean I got 'er, you thought right. 
ELLE Did you kill her? 
BUDD Not yet I ain't. But I can sure do it easy enough. She's so gentle right now, I could preform her coup de grace with a rock. 
ELLE What are you waiting for, run outta liquid courage. 
BUDD No. It's just...I ain't killed nobody in a long Goddamn time. And just 'tween you, me, and Jesus Christ, kinda made me a promise I wasn't gonna. Be that however it is. Back when I did kill people...I got paid for it. Just don't seem right...turn amateur this time of life. 
We stay on Elle's side for the following exchange. 
BUDD (O.S.) Anywho, guess what I'm holdin in my hand right now. 
We cut back to Budd's side. And what he's holding is The Bride's Hattori Hanzo sword. 
BUDD A brand spankin new Hattori Hanzo sword. And I'm here to tell ya Elle, that's what I call sharp. 
ELLE How much? 
BUDD Oh, that's hard to say. Seein it's priceless and all. 
ELLE I'll give you a hundred thousand dollars for it. 
BUDD I'm sure you would. But I'll take, one million. 
ELLE Jeez Budd, who'd ever guess you were such a capitalist. I thought drunks like yourself were beyond such monetary concerns? 
BUDD Well Elle, a million dollars buys a whole lotta Jack. 
ELLE Why then are you selling it to a hateful bitch like me, when you know Bill would pay more? 
BUDD If I'm gonna drink myself to death, ...it won't be on Bill's dollar. It's gonna be on yours. 
ELLE What's the terms? 
BUDD You buy a ticket to Texas, and I'll see you here tomorrow mornin. You give me a million in foldin cash, I'll give you the greatest sword ever made by a man. How's that sound? 
ELLE Sounds like we got a deal. One 
condition. 
BUDD What? 
ELLE You kill her tonight. (pause) And one more thing. 
BUDD You said one condition. 
ELLE It's a caveat to the same condition. 
BUDD What? 
ELLE She must suffer to her last breath. 
BUDD That Elle darlin, I can pretty damwell guarantee. 
ELLE Then I'll see you in the morning millionaire. 
CUT TO: 
OVERHEAD SHOT - EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT 
We look down on a spooky Texas graveyard... Tombstones...Graves...Dirt...Low-hanging fog. This could be the opening shot of a Texas zombie movie. We also see TWO MEN WITH SHOVELS (one which is Budd, the other which is ERNIE) digging up a grave. Budd's beat-to-shit pickup is in the shot too. Its headlight beams shining on the two men. And last but not least, The Bride, bound and gagged, lying in the flatbed 
of Budd's pickup. 
The BRIDE She begins to come to from the shot in her arm. Some dried blood lies caked around her wounds. Rope binds her wrists tightly together in front of her. 
A big leather cowboy belt is wrapped tight around her cherry brown cowboy boots. Her eyelids flutter open...and she sees stars. A giant, black Texas night sky full of them. 
She has no idea where she is. 
She turns her head to the left and sees, 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) That's a lot better. But you're still too agitated. Can you hear your heart? It's like I'm buried alive with Buddy Rich. Turn off that flashlight. 
Fear comes into her voice as she combats herself. 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) No! I can't turn off the light. Yes you can. The darkness will have a calming effect. Now turn off that fucking light. 
She does. The screen goes Jet Black 
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT 
Budd and Ernie are finished filling the grave. The old coffin, with the body of Paula Schultz, in the back of the flatbed. Before they climb into the truck and drive away, Budd lays a dozen red roses on The Bride's grave. 
INT. BUDD'S TRAILER (MOVING) - NIGHT 
Budd behind the wheel. Ernie in the passenger's seat. Car radio playing Mexican music. Budd's silver cell phone rings. 
BUDD (into phone) Yellow? 
INT. AIRPLANE (FLYING) - NIGHT 
Elle Driver sits in a seat on a passenger jet enroute to the great state of Texas. She calls Budd on the airplane phone. 
ELLE Didja do it? 
BUDD Elle darlin, she's sufferin as we speak. 
A smile spreads across Elle's face. She rests her head back against the seat's headrest. Her eyelids close. She slightly parts her lips...and lets out a; 
"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh" 
This is the face of satisfaction. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
BLACK FRAME TITLE APPEARS: 
Chapter eight 
"The cruel tutelage of Pai Mei" 
FADE UP ON 
EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - CHINA - DAY 
We see a beautiful mountain range in the middle of China. A SUBTITLE APPEARS UNDERNEATH: 
"SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF CHINA" 
A VOICE OVER SPOKEN BY BILL, tells us a story over this landscape; 
BILL (V.O.) Once upon a time in China, some believe around the year, one-double knot-three. 
As Bill tells this story, it will be illustrated On Screen by footage from Old Shaw Brothers Martial arts flicks of the 70's. Especially Films that feature Chinese Actor LO LIEH as the old, white-haired, white-eyebrowed Villian "PAI MEI." 
BILL (V.O.; CONT'D) ...head priest of The White Lotus Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down the road, contemplating whatever a man with Pai Mei's infinite power would contemplate -- Which is another way of saying, who knows. When, a Shaolin monk appeared on the road traveling in the opposite direction. As the monk and the priest crossed paths...Pai Mei -- in a practically unfathomable display of generosity, gave the monk the slightest of nods. The nod, was not returned. Was it the intention of the Shaolin monk to insult Pai Mei? Or, did he just fail to see the generous social gesture? The motives of the monk, remain, unknown. What is known, were the consequences. The next morning Pai Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple, and demanded that the temple's head Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck, to repay the insult. The Abbot, at first, tried to console Pai Mei, only to find, Pai Mei was inconsolable. So began, the massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and all sixty of the monks inside, at the fists of the White Lotus. And so began, the legend of Pai Mei's Ten-Point Palm - Exploding Heart Technique. 
THE BRIDE (V.O.) What praytell, is a ten-point palm - exploding heart technique? 
BILL (V.O.) Quite simply, the deadliest blow in all of the martial arts. He hits you with his fingertips, at ten different pressure points on your body. And then, he lets you walk away. But once you've taken five steps, your heart explodes inside your body, and you fall to the floor dead. 
We see on screen Pai Mei demonstrate this technique on five shaolin monks. Who after being hit...take five steps...then 
fall to the floor dead. 
EXT. JEEP (MOVING) - DAY 
Bill and The Bride, years earlier, driving in a jeep through the mountains of China, enroute to PAI MEI's. 
THE BRIDE Did he teach you that? 
BILL No. He teaches no one the ten-point palm - exploding heart technique. But he is Nietzsche's psalm personified. If Pai Mei doesn't kill you, he will make you stronger. Now one of the things I always liked about you, Kiddo, is you appear wise beyond your years. Then allow me to impart, a word to the wise. Whatever - WHAT - EVER - Pai Mei says, Obey. If you flash him - even for an instant - a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out. And if you throw any American sass his way, he will snap your back and your neck like they were twigs, and that will be the story of you. 
EXT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY 
The Bride sits in the jeep, by herself, parked in front of the Priest Pai Mei's home located high up on top of White Lotus Mountain. 
For over 100 years, his home used to be the temple of the White Lotus Clan, and he was the temple's head priest. The temple served as a home to over 60 priests and disciples. But now - the year 1990 - the White Lotus Clan is no more. All the priests have died. All that remains, is a very old man, who once upon a time, some worshipped as a god and some feared as a devil...neither was wrong. 
A huge stone staircase of one hundred steps climb up a hill leading to Pei Mei's home. Bill climbs down to the jeep. 
BILL He'll accept you as his student. 
THE BRIDE Caught him in a good mood, aye? 
BILL More like a sadistic one. 
She climbs out, and gets her bag out of the back. 
Bill casts a glance at the stone steps he just decended. 
BILL Just seeing those steps again makes me ache. You're gonna have plenty of fun carrying buckets of water up and down that fucker. 
THE BRIDE Why did he accept me? 
BILL Because he's a very very very old man. And like all rotten bastards, when they get old, they become lonely. Not that that has any effect on their disposition. But they do learn the value of company. 
THE BRIDE When will I see you again? 
BILL That's the title of my favorite soul song of the Seventies. 
THE BRIDE What? 
BILL Nothing. When he tells me you're done. 
THE BRIDE When do you think that might be? 
BILL That my dearest, all depends on you. Now remember, no backtalk, no sarcasm. Least not for the first year. You're going to have to let him warm up for you. He hates Caucasians, despises Americans, and has nothing but contempt for women, so in your case, that may take a little while. Adios. 
ZOOM... 
The jeep speeds off down the road...leaving the Bride all alone, somewhere in the middle of China. 
She begins the journey before her by ascending the 100 steps to Pai Mei. 
INT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE 
The huge temple is exactly like it must have been a hundred years ago, except now it's empty and dusty. 
The Bride enters, She's winded from climbing up those fuckin steps. 
THE BRIDE (yelling) Hello! 
Her Voice ECHOES in the cavernous temple. 
PAI MEI's VOICE ECHOES back; 
PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.) Up the stairs, yankee woman! 
A beautiful (but dusty) Mahagony staircase leads to Pai Mei's private chamber. 
THE BRIDE (to herself) More stairs, Jesus Christ. 
The still unseen Man's voice BOOMS back; 
PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.) If it is Christ you seek, turn back now. 
She climbs the wooden staircase. 
INT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE CHAMBER 
PAI MEI'S POV: We see through Pei Mei's pupils, through a sheer scarlet scrim that hangs down in front of his sitting area. The Bride enters the room. 
She approaches the old man, reaches the edge of his sitting area in front of the scrim, lowers to one knee and bows her head. 
PAI MEI * Now that really would be a shame. 
He takes the sword from her grasp... 
SWINGS once... 
The BLADES's against her jugular. 
He SWINGS twice... 
The BLADE's against the pocket of her throat. 
He SWINGS a third time... 
The BLADE's against the nipple of her right breast. 
PAI MEI * Your swordsmanship is amateur at best. 
He tosses the sword in the air, catching it by the tip of the blade. Then like a mallet, brings the handle end down hard on the top of The Bride's head. She lets out a howl, and falls to the floor, holding the lump on her noggin. 
PAI MEI * I'm a hundred and fifty years old, and you can't even make me break a sweat. 
He CHOPS the sword in half with his hand. 
PAI MEI * Let's see your Tiger and Crane style match my Eagles's Claw. 
Again she ATTACKS...again he eludes. 
Like a Gordon Liu and Lo Lieh film, they do their animal style martial arts dance. 
As she STRIKES and he BLOCKS...he yells out; 
PAI MEI * ...pathetic.....terrible...you idiot, you should've landed that blow...you call that crane?... Enough, I grow bored. 
With little effort on his part, he reaches out and GRABS her wrist, TWISTS...She's on the floor, with her arm stuck out in the air behind her, her wrist still between his fingers. He could literally break her arm in half. 
PAI MEI * I asked you to show me what you know, and you did. Not a goddamn thing. 
He TWISTS her wrist... 
...The pain is excruciating..... 
PAI MEI * Like all yankee women, the only thing you know how to do is order 
in restaurants and spend a man's money. 
He TWISTS more... 
She CRIES OUT. 
PAI MEI * Excruciating isn't it? I asked you a question! 
Through gritted teeth, she answers; 
THE BRIDE * Yes! 
PAI MEI * I could chop off your arm at will. I think I shall. 
He raises his other hand to chop off her arm. 
The Bride SCREAMS in ENGLISH; 
THE BRIDE No please don't! 
PAI MEI * If you wish to speak romantic languages, you've come to the wrong place. 
THE BRIDE * Please don't cut my arm off! 
PAI MEI * It's my arm now. I can do with it what I please. If you can stop me, I suggest you try. 
THE BRIDE * I can't! 
PAI MEI * Because you're helpless? 
THE BRIDE * Yes! 
PAI MEI * Have you ever felt this before? 
THE BRIDE * No! 
PAI MEI * Compared to me you're as helpless as a worm fighting an eagle, aren't you? 
THE BRIDE * Yes!!! 
PAI MEI * THAT'S THE BEGGING! 
He lets go of her wrist. She cradles her still-throbbing arm. 
PAI MEI * Is it your wish to learn how to make others as helpless as you were? 
THE BRIDE * Yes. 
PAI MEI * Can you cook? 
THE BRIDE * Yes. 
PAI MEI * I'll be the judge of    that. (pause) Draw me a bath...your    training will begin tomorrow. That    arm is still mine. You may lose it    yet. 
TIME CUT 
EXT. WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY 
Pai Mei stands in front of a wood wall three inches in front of him. His right fist is cocked back by his breastplate, he's concentrating on a certain spot on the wall. 
The Bride stands behind him, watching. 
He lets out a SCREAM, and puts his fist THROUGH THE WALL. 
He turns to the new student; 
PAI MEI * Since your arm now belongs to me, I want it strong. Can you do that? 
THE BRIDE * I can, but not that close. 
PAI MEI * Then you can't do it. 
THE BRIDE * I can put my hand through that at six inches. 
PAI MEI * And you could shoot a man from a rooftop with a scope-sight rifle, if you so desired, but this is not what I asked. What if your enemy is three inches in front of you, what do you do then? Curl into a ball? Or do you put your fist through him. 
He HITS the wall again leaving another hole. 
PAI MEI * Now begin. 
The Bride takes her place in front of the wall. She HITS it. Only managing to stain the wall with the blood from her scraped knuckles. Then again. And again.... 
INT. DINNER TABLE - NIGHT 
Both Pai Mei    and The Bride sit at the dinner table. Pai Mei concentrates    on eating. The Bride's hand is scraped bloody. She tries to    eat a bowl of rice with chopsticks, but her fingers won't    work. She puts down the sticks and takes a scoop of rice    with her fingers. 
Pai Mei WHACKS her on top of her head with his stick. 
PAI MEI * If you want to eat like a dog, I will make you live and sleep like a dog. Outside. If you want to live and sleep like a human being, pick up those sticks. 
She does. 
THE WOOD WALL 
The Bride HITTING it. 
She looks at her fucked-up hand, then to the wall, hesitating....Then Pai Mei's behind her. 
PAI MEI * It's the wood that       should fear your hand, not the other       way around. No wonder you can't do       it, you acquiesce to defeat       before you even begin. 
The camper door swings open. The Bride emerges from Budd's home, looking like a Barbie doll that's been dug up after ten years buried in the backyard, carrying a Hanzo sword. Every footfall creating a cloud of dust. 
The two women, each carrying a samurai sword, face each other in showdown position. 
A shark smile spreads across Elle's face. 
ELLE Bravo, Bea. I actually thought that alacky had got the best of you. 
THE BRIDE You thought wrong. 
The Bride unsheaths her sword with great flourish. 
Elle does the same. 
ELLE (referring to the sword) What's that? 
THE BRIDE Budd's Hanzo sword. 
ELLE He said he pawned it. 
THE BRIDE Guess that makes him a liar, don't it? 
Without raising their swords into position, the two blonde warriors circle each other. 
THE BRIDE (question) Elle? 
ELLE (answer) Bea. 
THE BRIDE I was wondering, just 'tween us girls, what did you say to Pai Mei for him to snatch out your eye? 
FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE of Pai Mei SNATCHING out Elle's eye with his Eagle's Claw. 
ELLE I called him a bastard. 
THE BRIDE Oooh, not so good. 
ELLE Were I to do it over again, I'd bite my tongue. 
THE BRIDE One more question? 
ELLE Shoot. 
THE BRIDE Where's Bill? 
ELLE Villa Quatro. 
THE BRIDE Gulf of Mexico? 
Elle nods her head 'yes.' 
THE BRIDE You wouldn't lie to me now? 
ELLE Why lie? 
Elle raises up The Bride's Hanzo sword into position. 
The Bride raises up her sword. 
THE BRIDE I saw what you did to that little Mamba in there. Want to try that on somebody your own size? 
ELLE I intend to. 
The Bride completely drops her sword stance and her samurai bearing. 
THE BRIDE Oh    Elle,   I    should warn   you    before we get started. Hattori Hanzo swords are extremely sharp. They can    take   a    little   getting    used   to. Careful not to cut your own arm off. 
ELLE I don't rattle, bitch! 
The Bride brings her sword back into combat position. 
THE BRIDE You're gonna bleed though, you're gonna bleed a lot. 
THEN... 
SPAGHETTI WESTERN MUSIC EXPLODES ON THE SOUNDTRACK. 
The two blonde warriors....swords in position...no longer circle each other....but instead move forward...closer and closer to each other....one baby step at a time... 
CU OF GIRLS. 
EX CU'S OF: 
Their separate GRIPS on the SWORD'S HANDLE. 
Their FEET moving closer. 
The Bride's eye. 
Elle's eye. 
The Tips of each other's Blade. 
Their Blonde Hair. 
As the Operatic Spaghetti Western Music Builds to a crescendo...we CUT BACK AND FORTH between CU's of the two women that get TIGHTER AND TIGHTER as we ZOOM in CLOSER and CLOSER....UNTIL...We reach the THEME'S CLIMAX.... 
Both women let loose with a    Samurai Grunt and Swing. 
EX CU: TWO SILVER BLADES CLASH. 
EX CU: BLONDE HAIR WHIPPING. 
EX CU: TWO SILVER BLADES CLASH AGAIN. 
TWO SHOT: The TWO WOMEN WARRIORS stand their ground, STRIKING and DEFENDING...When they stop, no one's been touched. 
The TWO WOMEN - Swords in attack position - stare across to the other one, as they prepare for their next attack... 
Now they begin to circle again. 
CU THEIR FEET making a circular walk. 
They ATTACK... 
EX CU BLADES MEET -- However this time we don't know who's on the left or the right. One Blade maneuvers around the other. 
EX EX CU: of TIP OF BLADE SLICING OPEN SKIN, about a quarter of an inch. It looks like a scalpel cut. No blood. Just skin separating. We don't know who's cut. 
The TWO WOMEN stand and face each other. Neither knows if it's them who has been struck. Neither woman bleeds. 
We feel a count of...One Mississippi... 
EX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE, clean as a whistle. 
EX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE with a smudge of CRIMSON BLOOD on its TIP. 
We feel a count of Two Mississippi... 
ELLE, 
BLOOD begins to PROJECTILE SPRAY out of a slice in Elle's neck only a quarter of an inch long. The Blood does not exit the neck as liquid but as a FINE RED MIST, like that of an aerosol can, we even HEAR the slight SPRAY WHISTLE. Elle feels nothing. She turns her eyes towards the sound of the spray, and sees the blood escaping her like air from a balloon. She lifts her hand and places it in the path of the spray, it's immediately BATHED IN RED. 
Elle drops the Bride's sword. 
As her blood continues to escape, both women look across each other. 
The effect is that Elle Driver is a balloon and her life is escaping before both their very eyes. And now looking across at each other, the two women see the other for the first time, not as adversaries, or opponents, or as rivals, or as bitches...but as sisters. 
Elle no longer has enough life in her to stand up...She falls to her knees in front of The Bride.... 
...then as she dies, she leans the side of her head against The Bride's standing body. Her blood runs down The Bride's leg. As she passes on, Elle gently wraps her arms around the Bride's leg. 
The Bride's hands go down to Elle's long blonde hair, and begins gently stroking it, easing her pain as she expires. 
THE BRIDE Oh, it's me all right. 
BILL I hear you were driving a truck? 
THE BRIDE My pussy wagon died on me. Who's your little friend? 
He glances down at the sleeping child. 
BILL Oh, you mean the little tow head next to me, who looks extraordinarily like you? 
THE BRIDE Yeah, that one. 
BILL Her name is B.B. 
The Bride gets choked up again, emotion betrays her voice. 
THE BRIDE B.B.? 
BILL Yes. Do you approve? 
She wipes her eyes. Her hand moves under her shirt, fingertips rest on scar. 
THE BRIDE Yes. Can she hear us? 
BILL Not now, she's in dream land. 
THE BRIDE How old is she? 
BILL What do you mean by that? 
THE BRIDE How many years has she been alive? 
BILL Don't ask how old she is, ask, if she's five. 
THE BRIDE Is she five? 
BILL Aren't mothers like God, aren't you supposed to automatically know? 
THE BRIDE I did and I do. (pause) I want to meet her. 
BILL Have dinner with us at my hacienda tonight. She's expecting you. 
THE BRIDE What do you mean? 
BILL I knew you were on your way, so I told B.B. Her mommy was coming to see her. 
THE BRIDE (confused) What have you told her about me? 
BILL That you were sick, that you were asleep, but one day you'd wake up and come back to her. And she asked me, "If Mommy's been asleep since I was born, how will she know what I look like?" To which I replied, "Because Mommy's been dreaming of you." And she said, "Then I'm gonna start dreaming of her." So I gave her a 
picture of you -- 
THE BRIDE -- which one? 
BILL The one I took of you in Paris, sitting on the steps with the baguette in your hand. Since she was one and a half years old, she's slept with that picture of you next to her bed. 
The EXACT PHOTO DISSOLVES OVER The Bride's face, then DISSOLVES AWAY. 
THE BRIDE You know, prettier photos of me do exist. 
BILL And she's seen them. But the one she wants looking after her while she sleeps is the one of you holding bread. (pause) We normally have dinner around seven, is that convenient? 
THE BRIDE Yes. 
Pause....The cars get closer... 
THE BRIDE When do we cross swords? 
BILL Well, it just so happens, my hacienda comes with its very own private beach. And my private beach, just so happens to look particularly beautiful bathed in moonlight. And there just so happens to be a full moon out tonight. So, swordfighter, if you 
want to sword fight, that's where I suggest. But if you wanna be old school about it - then we can wait till dawn, and slice each other up at sunrise, like a couple real life honest to goodness samurais. As per usual Kiddo, I'll leave the big decisions up to you. 
The cars will soon pass... 
THE BRIDE Do me a courtesy? 
BILL Anything. 
THE BRIDE Slow down as we pass...I want another look at her. 
BILL Wear something nice tonight? 
THE BRIDE I have a dress all picked out. 
BILL Will I like it? 
THE BRIDE You said I looked beautiful last time you saw me in it. 
BILL I'll dress up too. 
His foot moves off the gas, slowing the car; her foot does the same. 
The cars in SLOW MOTION start to pass. 
The Bride looks into the other car. 
We ZOOM past Bill to the little girl in the passenger seat. We go ONE FRAME AT A TIME till the car moves past us, to Bill holding a pistol with a large silencer pointing right at our face. He FIRES. It emits only a tiny PHOOF. 
The Bride throws herself across the passenger seat as the driver's side window EXPLODES over her head. 
The two cars pass each other. 
The Bride straightens herself in the driver's seat. She looks in the rearview as Bill and her daughter drive away. Grabbing the cell phone she screams in it; 
THE BRIDE You fucking maricone! 
Bill on his cell, eyes on rearview. 
BILL Now you just wait one second there little missy. Unless I'm confused, we are trying to kill each other aren't we? Now I wasn't planning on taking a shot at you in front of the squirt, but, she is asleep. And if you're gonna forget everything I ever taught you, and gawk like you ain't got good sense, I'm gonna take a shot, am I not? 
THE BRIDE Did she wake up? 
BILL Of course not. She's like you that way. I look forward to this evening. It was great speaking with you, Bea. 
He hangs up. 
INT. WHERE HATTORI HANZO SLEEPS - JAPAN - NIGHT 
Hattori Hanzo lies sleeping on his mat... 
WHEN... 
His phone wakes him up in the middle of the night...He hurriedly answers it. 
HANZO (JAPANESE) (in phone; groggy) Hello.... 
INT. MEXICO HOTEL - DAY 
The Bride's on the phone, calling Japan, in tears. 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) Hattori! 
HANZO (ENGLISH) Beatrix, what's wrong? 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) She's alive! My baby girl's alive! 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE BRIDE DRIVING TO BILL'S VILLA 
The same shot we saw during the opening credits. She's dressed in a white bridal gown, the exact replica of the one she was bushwhacked in. 
Over her CU we DISSOLVE TO A CU OF HANZO talking to her earlier on the phone. 
A SHOTGUN BLAST BLOWS A HOLE in the door, right where the bent over woman was previously standing. 
Karen kicks open the door, Pump Action Shotgun in hand. 
The Bride's on her back, on the floor below her. 
Karen aims the shotgun down at her. 
With her foot, The Bride kicks the front door. 
It SLAMS BACK HITTING Karen in the face. 
The Bride scrambles to her feet, running for cover. 
Karen pushes the door aside, steps into the room, and FIRES the shotgun The Bride's way. 
The Bride DIVES out of the way. 
The BLAST DESTROYS the side of the room it HITS. 
The Bride comes up from the floor with her SOG in her hand, and THROWS IT across the room at Karen... 
Karen BLOCKS the thrown knife with her shotgun. The blade sticking in the weapon's wooden stock. She removes the knife, and drops it to the floor. 
The Bride is a sitting duck. There's nothing she can do except wait to get shot. 
KAREN So you came here to kill Lisa Wong, huh? Well that's my sister, bitch. I'm Karen Wong, and I've come here to kill you. 
She raises the shotgun, and takes aim at The Bride... 
THE BRIDE Wait a second! 
Karen stops. 
THE BRIDE Yes, I'm an assassin. Yes I did come here to kill your sister. But I'm not gonna do that now. 
KAREN Oh, I know you're not -- 
THE BRIDE - listen to me! I just found out, right now - not two minutes before you blew a hole in the door, I'm pregnant. 
Karen looks at her, "what?". 
THE BRIDE On that table is the    home pregnancy kit. On the floor by    the door is the strip that says    I'm pregnant. I'm telling you the    truth, I don't want to and I won't    kill your sister. I just want    to go home. 
KAREN What is this, bullshit story number twelve in the female assassin's handbook? 
THE BRIDE Any other time you'd be a hundred percent right. But this time you're a hundred percent wrong. I'm the deadliest woman in the world, but right now I'm scared shitless for my baby. Please, you hafta believe me. Look at the strip, it's on the floor. 
Karen looks over to the door, and sees the tiny strip on the floor. 
KAREN Sit down on that bed and put your hands behind your head. 
The Bride complies. Karen bends down and picks the strip off the floor. Then takes the package it came in and reads the directions on the box. 
THE BRIDE Blue means pregnant. 
KAREN I'll read it myself, thank you. 
It is blue, Karen's starting to believe her. 
KAREN Okay, say I were to believe you, what then? 
THE BRIDE Just go home. I'll do the same. 
Karen does...She starts backing out of the room...before she leaves, she says; 
KAREN You fucked with the Wong sisters. 
BACK ON THE PORCH 
THE BRIDE Facing Karen Wong, was the most frightening moment I have ever experienced. And that includes three years with that evil bastard Pai Mei. Before that strip turned blue, I was a woman, I was your woman. I was a killer, who killed for you. Before that strip turned blue, I would have jumped a motorcycle on to a speeding train ...for you. But once that strip turned blue, I could no longer do any of those things. Not anymore. Because now I was a mother. A mother who only had one thought on her mind. Please don't harm my baby. Can you understand that? 
BILL Yes. But why tell me now, and not then? 
THE BRIDE You wouldn't have let me go. Specially once you found out I was pregnant. You would've tried to talk me out of it. It would have been a big scene. I just said fuck it. 
Starting to get mad. 
BILL Fuck who? 
THE BRIDE Bill, you couldn't know I was pregnant, once you knew, you'd claim it, and I didn't want that. 
BILL That's not your decision to make. 
THE BRIDE Yes, but it's the right decision. And I made it for my daughter. Everybody on this earth deserves to start with a clean slate. But with us - my daughter would be born into a world she shouldn't be. Robbing her of the one thing everybody deserves. She would be born with blood stains. I had to choose. I chose her. 
She takes a sip of wine. It's morning now. And now it's her turn. 
THE BRIDE You know five years ago, if I had to make a list of impossible things that could never happen. You performing a coup de grace on me by bustin a cap in my crown, would be right at the top of the list. (beat) I'd've been wrong, wouldn't I? 
Bill listens stoney, then; 
BILL I'm sorry was that a question? Of impossible things that could never happen - yes in this instance you would have been wrong. 
The Bride listens stoney, then; 
THE BRIDE Well? 
BILL Well what? 
THE BRIDE Explain yourself. 
BILL I already have. When I told you the story of when I thought you were dead. Didn't you get how badly I felt? 
THE BRIDE You call that an explanation? 
BILL Well if that's too cryptic let's get literal. (beat) There are consequences to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard. You experienced some of them. 
That's his explanation. 
She hears it. 
They both understand one another. 
THE BRIDE You and I have unfinished business. 
BILL Baby, you ain't kidding. 
They both laugh. 
BILL You know how proud I am of you, don't you? 
THE BRIDE Yes. 
BILL You know I was rooting for you, don't you? 
THE BRIDE I figured. 
BILL You know on that beach out there I want you to be the victor? 
She nods her head, yes. 
BILL You also know you're going to have to defeat me. I can't just give it to you, even though I want to. 
THE BRIDE It won't be necessary for you to give me anything. I've surpassed you. I'll take it. 
BILL Well, as they say in Missouri, show me. 
EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING 
As the blue waves of the Gulf of Mexico crash on the beach, The Bride in her bridal gown, and Bill, his tuxedo jacket off, face each other in a combat stance. 
The BRIDE Breeze blowing her blonde hair, holding her Hanzo sword in its sheath.

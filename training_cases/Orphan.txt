FADE IN: CLOSE -- KATE COLEMAN (MID 30S ) She's a simple beauty and very pregnant, propped up in a bed, wearing a hospital gown. A heart rate monitor BEEPS. She touches her swollen belly, flush with excitement, her eyes full of wonder. 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Okayp, just relax.now. This'll be over Caitti before you know it. Kate looks up. Her smile falters-as we REVEAL: 
INT. DELIVERY ROOM - NIGHT 
Harsh lights overhead. -THUNDER rumbles outside. Kate's on a. delivery table, legs already in the stirrups. A sheet hangs- across her belly so we can't see what's going on below her waist. A DOCTOR and NURSE snap pn gloves, prepare instruments: SHARP BLADES and CURETTES, NEEDLES and FORCEPS. Kate is stricken. She tries to sit up. 
KATE Wait, I've changed my mind. I don't want to do this anymore. The Doctor gives the Nurse an exasperated look. The Nurse takes Rate's hand, eases her back onto the table. 
NURSE Your baby is dead. There's nothing. else we can do. Kate reels, her world turned upside-dowp. Emotional free-fall. 
KATE No, this isn't what's supposed to happen. My baby's alive! 
NURSE We're so sorry. A terrible loss, we're so sorry... 
KATE But it's still alive! It's moving! Feel it, you can feel it! Kate tries to put the Nurse's hand on her.belly but the-Nurse- pulls away and hands the Doctor a pair of gleaming.blunt-tipped SURGICAL SCISSORS. The Doctor leans between Rate's spread legs, disappearing behind the curtain. Rate gasps. 
RATE No, stop! I want to be asleep! 
-DOCTOR- TOO late for anesthesia.'' The baby's coming. You're.going to experience some pressure now... - Kate winces and bites her lip as the Doctor goes about his unseen work. A GOOD-LOOKING MAN in surgical scrubs stands behind him.. Bizarrely, he's videotaping-the whole thing. He's Kate's husband, JOHN (late 30's). He smiles at her from behind -the camera. 
JOHN It's okay, honeys You're doing great! The Doctor hands the scissors, now slick with gore, to the Nurse. H e takes a SUCTION. CATHETER and disappears behind-the curtain again. The Nurse - presses a button on a vacuum pump and the machine begins to HUM. Kate tightly closes her eyes. 
KATE This isn't happening. Wake up, wake up, wake up... Suddenly -- the thin wail of a BABY CRYING. Rate's eyes go wide w ith horror as the smiling Nurse approaches with a wriggling bundle wrapped in a blanket. Blood seeps through the pink fabric. W e can't see what's inside, but it's moving. And it's CRYING. 
NURSE Congratulations, Mrs. Coleman. It's a girl . The Nurse offers her the bloody, blanketed bundle. Kate screams - 
INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
-- then snaps awake. She's been having a nightmare. John lies n ext to her in bed. Be stirs, but doesn't wake. Kate slips out of bed and quickly pads to the bathroom; 
INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Kate closes the door. We now see that she's not pregnant in reality, only in her nightmare. She slides to the cold floor in t he dark, a hand on her flat belly as she starts to cry... 
INT. DOCTOR BROWNING'S OFFICE - DAY 
Water TRICKLES in a little Zen fountain. Kate sits across from -DR. -BROWNING, a mousy-haired woman in her 50's. 
DR. BROWNING A lot of women experience difficulties around the anniversary of the miscarriage or the baby's expected due date. It's perfectly normal. 
KATE I was thinking of" going back to work. I really thought 1 was doing better. 
DR. BROWNING You are. Think about where you were just four months ago. - (off Kate's look) Are you still sober? Kate hesitates. Dr. Browning gives her a penetrating look. 
KATE I drove by the wine shop,on my.way.bome the other day. 
DR. BROWNING Did you stop? 
KATE I really wanted to. The thought went through m' head, you know. it wasn't for me, it just might be nice to have a bottle handy in case we had guests. 
DR. BROWNING. But you didn't go in? 
KATE No. 
DR. BROWNING That's all that matters. Let's try to stay focused on the. positive. Grief is different for everyone. You have to take it at your own pace.. Keep writing in your journal. You're doing fine. Rate smiles weakly. unconvinced. 
INT. LIVING ROOM -.DAY 
Rate hangs curtains over a beautiful picture window. She steps' back to admire her work, then sighs. Now what? Now that she s done, the house suddenly seems-quiet and lonely and too big. 
INT. NURSERY - DAY 
JOHN John. It's nice to meet you. She smiles and demurely offers her hand, giggling as he takes it. She blushes, then turns back to her painting. It's a half- finished jungle scene with a SMILING LION crouched beneath a tree. 
JOHN So what's this one going to bo? 
ESTHER My paintings are stories that come from my imagination. -This one'-s about a'sad mother lion who can't find her cube. 
JOHN She's smiling. 
ESTHER She's dreaming about her babies. It's the only thing that makes her happy. 
JOHN Well, I hope she finds them. 
ESTHER She will. I,bok. As she speaks, Esther dabs her brush and paints little lion cubs curled up in front of their sleeping mother: 
ESTHER They were lost'in the jungle 'and they were so scared because they didn't'have a mother or father. But just when they thought they'd be alone forever, they found their mother sleeping under this tree. And they felt so safe that they fell asleep too. Now when-the mother lion wakes up, her dream will have come true. She has her family again. 
JOHN Where did you learn how to do this? 
ESTHER Y've just had lots of time to practice, I guess. It's so boring here. 
JOAN You don't play outside with the other girls? Sounds like they're having fun. 
ESTHER I like staying inside. That way I don't get my clothes dirty. 
JOHN (amused) - Well, that's very responsible of you, but I'll- bet the sisters could find something else for you. to wear. 
ESTEER You.don't like my dress? - Don't you think it's pretty? - 
JOHN Your dress is. very pretty. I'm ,just saying. you could -probably go outside if you really wanted to. 
- ESTHER (a beat, hesitant) I don't like laying with the other .girls. I'm different from everyone. 
JOHN There's nothing wrong with different. 
ESTHER Yes, there is. Everybody says there's not, but it isn't true. I don't care. If I'm sad or lonely, I just come in here a nd paint a story with a happy endingg And when people say they like. my paintings, it makes me feel better. (off his look) I think.peo le should always try to take the bad things that happen to them and turn them into something good. Don't you? John is taken aback. Who j t1m1s )dc? Before he can respond: 
.- RATE (O.S.) There you are. Rate and Sister Abigail stand in the doorway. John waves for Kate to enter and Esther sits up eagerly when she does. Abigail's expression darkens when she sees who John has been talking to. 
JOHN Hey, I'd like you to meet someone. - (to Esther). Esther, this is my wife, Kate. Kate smiles and offers her hand, but instead of shaking it, Esther lovingly presses it to her cheek. 
ESTIIR - Motta... Kate'and John exchange a beumsed look'. 
JOHN She painted these all by herself. 
' RATE Wow, you're quite the little-artist. 
ESTHE'R Thank you. You smell nice. Kate laughs. Sister Abigail shifts uncomfortably. 
ESTHER Would you like me to paint you a picture? You can watch me if-you want. I'm normally a little shy, but -- 
SISTER ABIGAIL' Esther, I'm sorry, they don't have time for you to paint them a picture. (off Esther's look) They have to come with me now. Yolanda's going home with them tomorrow. isn't that wonderful? Esther wilts. She releases Rate's hand and musters a weak smile. 
ESTHER Yes. I'm sure she'll be very happy. 
KATE It was nice meeting you. 
ESTHER - The pleasure was mine. 
JOHN (to Sister Abigail) You've got a real talent on your hands here. 
SISTER ABIGAIL Yes, we're very lucky to have her. But there's something -strange-in Abigail's voice -- she definitely doesn't un -lucky. Esther watches them go. 
INT. HOME FOR GIRLS - ENTRY - DAY 
Sister Abigail walks Kate and John to the front door. 
I5. 
SISTER ABIGAIL The notary will be here at.ten for-you- to sign the placement agreement. 
KATE Thank you so much for all your help. Kate gives her a warm hug. But mid-embrace, she notices something: Esther is at the end of the hallway, peering at them from around a corner. Abigail and John see--her,' too. 
- JOHN.. No. Don't say that. - 
RATE- - we -try to .have a baby and I have a 'third-trimester miscarriage that leaves. me sterile. 'We try to adopt and she dies the night before we bring her home. That doesn't sound like' somebody's trying to tell us. something? 
JOHN   - Yolanda didn' t the to.teach us a lesson.. We didn't make this-happen. 
KATE ' It doesn't make.anndifference. I can't go through this again. 
JOHN so let's not. Let's adopt.Bather. This brings Kate back to reality. She eyes him coolly. 
KATE Her body's barely cold and you're already thinking about replacing her? 
JOHN . We can't replace Yolanda any more than We can replace Jessie. But we can't help her anymore, either. Esther is alive and needs a family. Right now. 
KATE We have to at least wait until.-- 
JOHN -Until what? I don't want to waste .a nother year of our lives wishing for something that we.can't-have. (beat). I want us to feel like a family again. Kate regards him for a beat, conflicted. Then: 
KATE Let's see what Sister Abigail thinks. 
INT. HOME FOR GIRLS - SISTER ABIGAIL'S OFFICE - DAY - 
Sister Abigail hands Rate and John a folder with a Polaroid of Esther stapled to it. Her- case file. 
SISTER ABIGAIL For the most -part, she's an'ideal child. She's originally from Russia, but her English is flawless, Smart as a.tvhip and very mature Â°for her age. I don't think I've-ever had to tell her .anything-twice and I've never had to clean-up after her.. She's a bit of a- nQat-freak. 
JOHN I think we can handle that. 
SISTER.ABIGAIL She's also fiercely independent., Whatever the other-children want to do, she wants to.dc the opposite. 
JOHN She told me they make fun of her. 
SISTER ABIGAIL I'm sure they do, but she doesn't make- things any easier on herself. She just doesn't seem interested in friends.. She doesn't even play like a normal child. She just reads and paints. Most of the time she barely-speaks. 
KATE Why do'you think that is? 
SISTER ABIGAIL . Well, like most of the girls here, there's been no shortage of hardship in her life.- She's been orphaned twice-- her birthmother died of AIDS, then the American family who adopted her was- killed in.a house fire. And I strongly suspect that she's been sexually abused as well. 
KATE By who? 
SISTER ABIGAIL I don't know. There's nothing in her -history, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything. Russian adoption - records. are notoriously unreliable. 
JOHN Then what are you basing this on? Sister Abigail hesitates. Deciding how much to say. 
SISTER ABIGAIL I wish I knew. There's just something missing with her. A-spark you see in a child's eyes that isn't there. I've only seen that-before in cases where the child had been severely traumatized. It might also explain - some of her idiosyncratic behaviors. 
JOHN Like what? 
SISTER ABIGAIL She refuses to shower or change clothes with the other girls.' She won't even allow the housemother in-the bathroom with her. She.'.s also very concerned with her physical appearance for her age. She's like a teenager getting ready for a date every morning. She insists on wearing dresses-every day. The ribbons around her wrists and neck stay on day and night. . The only trouble we ever had with her was when we tried to take them off. She kicked two of Sister Francis' teeth-out. Kate and Tohn are taken. aback. Abigail sighs. 
SISTER ABIGAIL I'm sorry. I'm 'not trying to discourage you. If you're serious, I'll do everything I can to-expedite the process, given the circumstances. 
(BEAT) My one reservation is..this. When-an adoption fails, it's usually because the parents didn't know what to expect. -And'in this case, I can't' tell you what to expect because the plain fact of the- matter is that-I don't knaw. 
INT: HOME FOR GIRLS - CHAPEL DAY Esther is happily-helping a NUN clean the sanctuary. Kate and John sit in a pew near the back of the empty chapel. 
KATE She really did open up with us, didn't she? 
JOHN She latched. right onto you. We're probably the best chance she has at a. normal life. Esther looks up from her work and waves at them. They wave back. 
KATE A normal life..' That sounds really good,',doesn't it? - She smiles. and takes John- .'s hand. 
EXT. HOME FOR GIRLS - DAY. 
CAXERA FOLLOWS Esther's feet, saddle shoes CLICKING on -the walk. Kate walks beside her, holding her hand. In Esther's free hand, she clutches a DOG-EARED BIBLE held together with a rubber band. Activity on the playground stops as the girls watch Esther leave. None of them look sorry to see her go. She ignores them. John puts.Esther's things ---- a small suitcase and her-paintings in the trunk of the car.. Sister-Abigail sees them off.- 
SISTER ABIGAIL If you ever need anything, please don't hesitate to call. Before Kate. can respond, Esther tugs on her arm. 
_ESTHER Come on! Let's-go) Kate laughingly lets Esther drag her away. 
RATE (to Abigail) We wills Sister Abigail happily watches them go.. Rate and Esther smile and wave goodbye.' She'waves back... but once the car pulls out, her smile fades. She seems'vaguely troubled as they drive away... 
John walks behind Esther, his-hands over her eyes. Kate leads her into the darkened roam by the hand. 
KATE Are you ready? Esther nods excitedly. John uncovers her eyes. Esther stops short in awe. It's the FISH TAN C from the shopping, mall. Esther kneels before it, entranced. She turns the black light on and off, marveling at- how it makes her dzess glow and the colors in her paintings light- -up. She gives Kate and John a. big smile. 
INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Rate and John get dressed for church. John pulls on a tie. Kate searches through a jewelry box. She's missing something. 
KATE nave-you seen my pearls? 
INT. CHURCH -- DAY 
Sunday morning in America. Kate and John sit with Doris and the kids. -A.PRIEST reads-from the scripture and a SIGN LANGUAGE II?TERPRETBR translates. Esther follows along in her own Bible and Kate notices aphoto poking from between its pages. All she can see is the face of a RUGGED-LOOKING MAN in his 40's. She eyes it curiously...

INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY

KATE Did you take this out of my jewelry box? Max shakes her head, confused. 
KATE Then-how did it get in your room? 
MAX 
I DON'T KNOW. 
KATE Somebody put this around T.J.'s neck. Who was it if it wasn't.you? Max shrugs. She looks-nervous. Kate sighs. 
RATE Go take a time-out and think about it. 
ESTHER But we're playing] 
KATE She can finish your game later. (to Max) Come on. Max pouts and follows Kate upstairs. Esther watches them go. 
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
Esther stands in front of a class full of KIDS. Their teacher, MRS. GROSSE, is introducing her. Esther's wearing a pretty little dress'and Shirley Temple curls, but her usually unflappable smile seems wary, uncertain in the face of these staring third graders. 
MRS. CROSSE This is our new student. Her name is Esther Coleman and I want you all to make her feel very welcome today. One of the kids, BRENDA, whispers. a wisecrack to a FRIEND. Esther shifts uncomfortably. 
INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 
Esther sits at the end of the table where Brenda and her FRIENDS are eating.. They eye her derisively. Esther ignores them- and prays over her lunch. The other girls exchange amused looks. Brenda folds her hands and makes an earnest, mocking face: 
BRENDA Dear Jesus, please help me to not dress like such a freak tomorrow. The girls laugh. Esther pays no attention. 
INT./EXT. TREEHOUSE - DAY 
Daniel and his friends AUSTIN and TREVOR run down a short path through the woods behind.the Coleman's house to a tall tree. CAMERA REVEALS an enclosed treehouse about ten feet up -This is' no "Little Rascals" job -- this thing was professionally built. They climb up to it.

O

EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - DAY 
Esther and Max pick wildflowers along the edge of the forest. 
ESTHER Let's pick flowers for Daddy. Max.nods happily. 'Then Esther notices something that makes her stop short. A girl approaching on a bicycle... It's Brenda. She pretends to not see Bather, just rides right by. Esther watches, her face strangely slack... then starts to follow .her. Max gives Esther a confused look, but tags along. 
EXT. PARK -- DAY 
Esther finds Brenda's bike parked at a neighborhood playground ---- swings carousel, jun7le gym, and a-tall corkscrew slide made-tor look like a rocket ship. There are KIDS playing. MOMS watching. 
A BONELESS GUY with a shopping cart full of stuffed garbage bags asleep by a tree. WOMEN. doing pilates. Esther ignores them all. Brenda is climbing on the jungle gym with some other kids. Esther walks over with Max in tow and just watches Brenda play. Brenda sees her and makes a face. Esther just stands there. Staring. 
BRENDA . What are you looking at? No response. Max tug on Esther's arm, but she's rooted in place, staring blankly at Brenda. Finally, Brenda can't take it. She climbs off the jungle gym and walks away. Esther watches 'her go.. Brenda gets on a swing, but just as she starts to get some height, Ester' right there,.star n ,_p a her again. Max happily grabs a swing for herself, but Esther is fixated on Brenda. 
BRENDA Stop staring at.mel Stop ital. But Esther is unwavering. Can't take her eyes off of her. Brenda gets off the swing and runs away. Esther calmly walks after her. 
BRENDA Go-away! Stop following me, freak! Max sees Esther following Brenda and grudgingly gets off the swing, hurrying to -catch up. Brenda gives them an angry look. 
" BRENDA Why don't you two,go home and change each other's diapers? Esther and Max follow Brenda across the park,, Max still uncertain about what's going on.. Brenda heads for. the tall corkscrew slide. Steep stairs lead to the enclosed top, the tip of the rocket ship. Brenda starts up the stairs, then pauses. She turns to Esther. 
BRENDA You go first. Esther doesn't move, but Max gladly takes her turn. After a beat, Esther follows Max up the stairs. Brenda stays behind, watching. Max goes down the spiraling slide, but Esther just stands at the top, looking down at Brenda. 
BRENDA Gol! Esther, continues to stare down at her for a beat, then turns and -disappears from eight. only. then does Brenda climb up. Max runs to the stairs for- another turn. Brenda reaches the top and looks around. She sees Max.' But where's Esther? She turns. 
Suddenly, Es er is right in ,AIL of her.   She didn't' go down the slide, she was just crouched out of sight. Brenda gasps -- -- then Este spits Jn her face acrd ush hex dawn the airs. Brenda SCREAMS as she falls,-limbs flailing, out-of-control. She lands hard in the dirt and just lies there crying, clutching her arm and bleeding from a gash in her forehead. Brenda's scream draws alarmed looks. The Homeless Guy startles awake. one of the playground mothers comes running to help. But Max stands frozen, gaping at Esther in total shock. Esther stares blankly down.at Brenda from atop the slide. Utterly emotionless. 
EXT. PARK - DAY (TIMCUT) 
BRENDA'S FATHER arrives on the scene. Brenda says something. to -him and points at Esther and Max, who watch from a distance. 
ESTHER Are you going to tell on me? Max shrugs. 
ESTHER I didn't mean to hurt her. I just wanted her-to stop picking on me. (off Max's look) Don't you hate it when someone is mean to you for no reason? Wouldn't you do almost anything to make them stop? A best. Max nods. Esther offers her hand and Max takes it.

ESTHER Give it-back. 
DANIEL, Make me.

INT.-DENTIST'S OFFICE - EXAM ROOM -- DAY 
The DENTIST lowers Esther back in the chair, pulls on rubber gloves. The HYGIENIST clips a dental bib around Esther's neck. 
HYGIENIST She hasn't had a check-up in about two years, so she's a little nervous. 
-DENTIST she doesn't look to me. Now let's have a look at those co ppers. Esther just looks at the ceiling with her mouth tightly shut. 
DENTIST. Come on, darling, open wide. -Esther eyes him anxiously; then reluctantly opens. Just a bit. 
DENTIST That a girl: Little wider... She opens more. He leans in to take a look... Suddenly, she SHdMPS dawnn his jinx s hard Pnou h to draw blo-mss fr and locks ï¿½n like Rottweileï¿½] The Hygienist is frozen in shock.

Driving home.. Kate stews, on her last frayed nerve. Esther gazes out the window, seemingly oblivious, singing a little nonsense song under her breath: "La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La--la-la ..." Kate stops at a traffic light. Glances outside. She's stopped next to a LIQUOR.STORE. Kate quickly looks .away, her temptation real enough to startle her. The light turns green and she drives off without looking back. Esther keeps SINGING.. A few blocks later, they pass a BAR. Then a bus shelter with a big ABSOLUTE VODKA AD. Kate probably drives by them every day, but now they're popping out at her, sly old enemies that never really left, re-emerging from the shadowy recesses of her mind. She tries to focus on the road, Esther's VOICE grating in her head... "La-la-la, la-la-la-la:.. La-la-la, la-la-la-la..." 
INT. FOYER -- DAY 
Kate and Esther enter. Esther skips upstairs. Kate sighs, angry and frustrated. She plays a message on the ANSWERING MACHINE. 
SISTER ABIGAIL (V.0.) Hello, this is Sister Abigail calling for John and Kate. Please call me as soon as you get this message. I have. something that we need to discuss in person. It's regarding. Esther. 
UPSTAIRS Esther stands at the top of the stairs, listening to-the message- She's heard everything. And she's scared. Scared and pissed. 
INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BEDROOM.- NIGHT 
Kate and John get ready for bed. 
KATE He's been our dentist for ten years. Why would he lie to us? 
JQAN I didn't say he's lying. I just think Ws-blowing it out of proportion, 
KATE I saw the bite marks. We're lucky he's not suing us. 
JOHN Fine, but I don't believe for a"second that she just did it for no reason. 
RATE That's because she's always on her best behavior with you. 
JOHN' That's. not true. I've had to deal with her at her worst.. 
- KATE What you think is her worst is what she's like with me all the time. She's completely- different with me than she is with you'., 
JOHN So you've seen her haul off'and bite someone like an animal? 
ESTHER ' Look for the key to the treehouse.' -Max nods and they start searching the room. Esther rifles through John 's desk. - Nothing.  She looks in a closet. A DARK PLASTIC CASE with Two PADLOCKS on it catches her eye... 
Max opens a. keepsake chest and finds SEVERAL KEYS on:a ring. She excitedly shows them to Esther. Esther smiles and takes them. As they're about to leave,.Esther. Uses. She looks back at the- closed closet. Then looks at the keys. Max eyes her curiously. Esther slides a chair over to. the closet and opens it.. She stands on the chair, pulls down the case with the padlocks on it, and sets it on the floor. She tries a couple of.keys. Then -- CLICK. There's a GUN inside. A shiny revolver and a BOX OF AMMUNITION. Esther's face lights up. She.carefully picks up the gun{-turns it over, looks at it. Max's eyes nearly pop out. Esther gives her a sly look, then loads a single bullet, SPINS. the cylinder... .and points the cmn at ax. Ri.aht between the Bye 
ESTHER Do you -want to_ play? - A beat. Max shakes her head. Esther smiles, fingers the trigger. After a long, awful, pants wetting eternity, she lowers the gun. 
ESTHER You're right. We'd better not. 
(BEAT) Not yet. - 
INT. LIVING ROOM -- DAY 
Sister Abigail sits across from Kate and John with a grave look. 
SISTER ABIGAIL When you first asked about adopting Esther, I expressed some misgivings. But I wasn't completely straightforward with you. You see, I love children. I've worked with them my entire life. And the thing about love is that it sometimes clouds your judgement. 
(BEAT) But the truth is that I knew there was something wrong with Esther from the moment I laid eyes on her. Kate sits up, concerned. John bristles. 
- KATE You said you suspected, some kind of abuse. 
SISTER ABIGAIL Yes, but there was something else. It was hard to say chat it was at first. Just-a feeling that she was a profoundly damaged little girl. 
(MORE) 
SISTER ABIGAIL ' (CONY' D) (beat) s eemed Then I notaced that she - always k_ to. be around whenever ther' wwasa get kind of trouble.- Two girls iii a fight. And there she'd be . Someone would get caught stealing. And ell she'd - myself it Was But I never really. believed it. (beat) l who After you told me about the gir broke her arm, -:E -started wondering again. I called the achool:Esther went to while she was with the Wallaces and asked if there'd been any serious accidents while she.Was there.. One incident was still fresh in everyone's minds. A boy in one of her classes was stabbed in the throat with a pair of 'scissors. All the kids-who saw it happen said it was an accident, that he was running with the scissors and fell. But once again, Esther, was there. 
ANGLE - ESTHER is eavesdropping from around the corner. She slips away. 
BACK TO SCENE 
JOAN But none of these things were her fault. 
SISTER ABIGAIL That's; g I was reluc!tant to t anything bef ore. Now'I think th at may a have been a mistake. (off their-looks) Children like Esther, who've spent their entire lives-in institutions, have never had' a chance to 'form normal, lasting bonds.. The longterm effects of 'this- can be devastating.   In the very worst cases, children who fail to form early attachments are unable to learn the difference between'right and wrong. They can lie, cheat, steal --- .or worse -and and have no remorse whatsoever for their actions.' They view other human beings as objects, pawns for their amusement. And they can-be potentially very dangerous.

INT. LIVING ROOM'- DAY 
JOEt7- This.doesh't sound like Esther at all. 
SISTER ABIGAIL A severely character-disturbed child can appear to be -completely normal, -even exceptional. It's like they have two faces one-they show the outside world in order'to get what they want, and the other, their true face, lying just beneath the surface. 
INT. MAX'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Max sits on her bed, wearing a jacket and clutching her "Bello. Kitty" backpack. Anxious and waiting. Esther enters. - 
- E5T_HBR Let's go. 
INT. LIVING ROOM  - DAY - 
KATE What about the orphanage in Russia where she was raised? Wouldn't they have been able to tell? 
SISTER ABIGAIL - I've put in a call to the director there, but she could have easily slipped through the. cracks. 
JOHN - So the bottom line here is that you don't have proof of any of this. 
SISTER ABIGAIL That's true,-I don't. But I believe the circumstantial evidence is enough to warrant taking the next step. 
RATE Which is what? - 
SISTER -ABIGAIL Get Esther out of'the house. Kate and John are stunned. 
JOHN You want to disrupt the adoption over this?! 
SISTER ABIGAIL - If I'm-wrong, she-can come back home. But you need to get her to a therapist who can tell you what you're dealing 
WITH 
MAX 
YOU, TRICKED ME. 
ESTHER. That doesn't matter. 'They'll send you to jail just for helping me bury her. Max starts to cry. Esther moves closer, comforting. 
ESTHER She wanted to take me away from you. 
(BEAT) Now we eau be together forever.

It's Esther. She smiles  at the. vendor and walks away. She- spots the Homeless Guy across the park and casually heads toward him. As she approaches, we see that she's carrying the -plastic yrocery bag with the bloody hammer and sister Abigail's things in t. She carefully looks around to snake sure nobody is watching, then nonchalantly tosses the incriminating bag into the Homeless Guy's shopping cart and keeps walking, sucking on her SpongeBob pop... 
INT. LIVING ' ROOM -  DAY

JOHN You're not going to therapy? When did you decide that? 
SATE When do you think? John sighs. A tense-beat. 
JOHN I know you were. upset. But we have to at least consider the possibility that she's right about this. 
KATE No, we don't. Why does everybody around here get the.benefit of the doubt fro m you except me? 
JOHN That's not true. I'm just..worried about you, that's all. We can hire someone to help you with the kids if it's getting to be too much.

ESTHER I don't think !'Tommy likes me very much. 
John is taken aback. An awkward beat.- 
JOHN That's not true..- Mc=my loves 'you. 
ESTHER It's all right. I understand if she doesn't. It must be difficult to love an adopted child as much as- your own.. 
JOHN Sweetheart, .you are just as much a part of this family- as Danny. and Max are. Mommy doesn't love'you any less because you're adopted. Do you understand? She nods, but doesn't look convinced. John thinks. 
JOHN Why don't you do something special for her? So she can see what a good girl you are. I'll bet she'd like that. Esther's face brightens. 
EST LER That's a wonderful idea. I think I know just what I'm.going to do, too.

DR. BROWNING. But Max says she didn't see Esther do anything wrong. Max is cover.ng for her. And X don't think it's the first time. 
DR. BROWNING It also-wouldn't be the first time that you've tried to blame Esther for. something that was really your fault. 
XATE This. isn-'t all in my head. Sister Abigail was right. There is something wrong with Esther. And I don't care anymore if I can't prove it. I'want her out of this house. John and Dr. Browning exchange a dark look. 
DR. B' OWNING So you're at a place where you would actually let somebody take her away? 
KATE I'll do whatever I have to,do to protect my children. 
JOHN 56 will 1. (re: Dr. Browning) That's why she's here. something in his voice makes Kate apprehensive. An uneasy beat. 
DR. BROWNING I have an opening held for you at a residential rehabilitation clinic about forty-five miles from here. They specialize in extended treatment for women who are relapsed alcoholics. Kate is stunned silent. She gapes at. them. with a mix of anger and fear, unable to stop' a flash of guilt. How much do they know...?. 
KATE . What are you talking.about?

KATE I haven't had a drink in almost a year. John sighs, frustrated.- Dr. Browning intervenes, her voice infuriatingly even. and calm.' 
DR. DROWNING Relapse is very common in early sobriety. We can help you. But not until you drop the charade. - 
KATE It's not a charade. I wanted to- drink i t. You have no fucking idea how.badly I wanted to drink it. But I didn't. (off John's look) I know 1 should have told you..  I was just afraid of what you'd do. 
JOHN I wanted you to come to me. That's why ,I didn't confront you with it last night. If Max had gotten hurt this morning, it. would've been because I trusted you tell me if there was a problem. 
RATE What happened this morning had nothing to do with this! 
DANIEL -Stop it!- She's going to kill us if we don't tell! Morn and Dad can protect us! Max. shakes her head. Daniel releases her. 
DANIEL Why not? 
MAX 
NOBODY CAN. Daniel stops short. Max hesitates, then gets up and shows him the pictures that she hid from him when he first came in. They're crude crayon drawings of Max and Esther. In the first, Esther stands atop the rocket ship slide and pushes Brenda down the stairs while Max watches.. The= next one turns Daniel's blood cold. X &'s of Sister Abigail's murder. Esther stands over Sister Abigail with a bloody hammer wh e r e Max cowers under the bridge. The last one is of Esther and Max in the treehouse. Esther is covered in blood.

ESTHER She's fine. Lot's not wake her. 
KATE What are you doing in here?

(LAUGHS) Honestly, we're past that now, aren't we?. 
t KATE I'um not going to let you hurt my children. - 
ESTHER 1m not the one who passedouutt drunk. and let I hear the first step is (on.ffideannttially) -admitting that. you have a problem. 
KATE (a beat, stricken) Who told you about that. - Esther holds up Kate's journal:: Kate blanches. 
ESTHER It's in your journal. I found ï¿½it a few weeks ago.. It's very intimate. 3 learned so much about you. Your marital troubles, your drinking problem. Where you hide your wine bottles. You have lovely handwriting, by the way. Would you like to bear my favorite part? Esther has a page marked. She reads: 
ESTHER "Eight weeks before my due date, Jessica died-from several undiagnosed birth defects. I hadn't felt her move for days, but now that I knew she was dead, I started-to feel her kick again. It's called phantom fetal movement, like the pain felt in a missing limb. I was an amputee and my baby was the lost part of me. Because of other complications, Doctor Kosgrove didn't want to induce. So I had to wait to go into labor. For sixteen days I carried Jessica's body and felt her ghostnow a kicking in my-belly. y womb coffin and inside me slept a corpse." (to Kate) How perfectly hideous. No wonder you turned into a nasty, smelly drunk. Kate is dumbfounded, trembling with impotent rage and raw emotion. 
ESTHER Kate. You don't know how lucky you are, I'll never have children of my own. My father paw to that while I was still-in diapers. I. actually don't"remember a 7 time when he wasn't fucking.me.

RATE I'mi pot weak.. 
ESTHER Please. You're soft. Like,& worm. Losing your baby could have. made you stronger. But for you it's alwa s.more therapy and more- pills and more booze. Anything so that you don.'t have to actually face the so state of your miserable existence. And why should you? You've got John to carry your dead weight around.. But you know something? You don't deserve him. And sooner 'or later, he's going to figure that out. Esther stands up to leave. Kate-blocks her path. 
ESTHER What are you going to do? Hit me? -Kate. looks really tempted. A beat. She puts out her hand for the journal. Esther gives it to her with a smile. Kate steps aside. 
ESTHER See you tomorrow. She leaves. Kate glares after her. -

FINAL DESTINATION 2 By J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress 
FADE IN: 
INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT 
TITLES OVER: 
A padded wall is papered with NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS that date back to the early 1900s: 
"LOCAL FOWLER BROTHERS LOSE $35 TICKETS TO BOARD TITANIC" appears over "FOWLER BROTHERS KILLED IN COAL MINE MISHAP." Another series of articles reads, "JEWISH PROFESSOR DENIED ADMITTANCE TO HINDENBURG" and "PROFESSOR RABINOWITZ KILLED IN AVALANCHE." Etc... 
Continuing along the wall, the newspaper articles all focus on the fates of the original SURVIVORS of the FLIGHT 180 CRASH. 
We DISSOLVE between the various headlines depicting the gruesome deaths of Tod, Terry, Ms. Lewton, Billy Hitchcock, Carter and Alex Browning. 
Also in the mix are various CRIME SCENE PHOTOS of the deaths. 
Decapitated torsos, crushed, mangled bodies, the charred remains of another and the face- down body of Alex Browning. 
MAPS line the walls as well, pinpointing the locations of numerous deaths, perhaps seeking a pattern. Charts that timeline bizarre deaths, seating charts of downed aircraft, etc... 
LATEX -GLOVED HANDS tear out the last article, apply fun- tack to its corners and place it in the center of all the others: 
A REMEMBRANCE FOR THE VICTIMS OF FLIGHT 180 
Friday marks one year anniversary. 
END TITLES. 
FLASH TO BLACK as a HAND ENTERS FRAME, PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 
EXT. KIMBERLY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 
KIMBERLY BURROUGHS, 19, puts a folded AAA map in her mouth. She opens the back of a RED NISSAN SUV, and pla ces her duffel bag inside. 
That done, she lets the map drop from her mouth, catches it in her free hand and turns to hug her father, MR. BURROUGHS. 
KIMBERLY Thanks, Dad. I'll call you. 
MR. BU RROUGHS You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card? 
KIMBERLY Relax, Dad. It's Daytona, not Mongolia. 
MR. BURROUGHS (playful) Fix -A-flat? Road flares? Sunblock? Mace? 
SHAINA (O.S.) Condoms, handcuffs, lube? 
Kimberly and Mr. Burroughs turn to see -- 
SHAINA, 19, tall leggy brunette. Tan, tight tube top revealing her pierced navel, Kimberly's best friend. She walks up the driveway with her bags. 
SHAINA Just kidding, Mr. B. Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on her. 
MR. BURROUGHS (sarcastic) Oh, that makes me feel a lot better. 
Shaina throws her bags in, shuts the back and climbs in the SUV. Kimberly hugs her dad, kissing him on the cheek. 
KIMBERLY I know this is the first time we've been apart since. But everything's gonna be okay. 
MR. BURROUGHS I know, honey. I just -- 
Kimberly hugs him tighter. Cutting him off. 
MR. BURROUGHS Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this... 
KIMBERLY (softly) I know, Dad. 
SHAINA (O.S.) Hello, the guys are waiting! 
Kimberly gives him a quick kiss, jumps behind the wheel, starts the car and pulls away as Shaina cranks up the stereo. 
MR. BURROUGHS Buckle up! 
Mr. Burroughs waves as the girls roar off. As he looks down he spots an OIL STAIN left by Kimberly's SUV. As he drags his shoe across the stain, a SLIGHT BREEZE blows past his face. 
CAMERA PUSHES IN as a look of concern crosses his face. 
EXT. HIGHWAY ON RAMP - DAY 
ON OLD WOMAN 
As she pushes her supermarket cart up the on ramp. A SQUEAKY WHEEL is shrill and disturbing. 
DRIVERS of several waiting vehicles avoid staring at her weathered face as she passes. Up ahead waiting in line, is Kimberly's red SUV. 
KIMBERLY I will, Dad. Bye, luv you. 
Kimberly passes a STATION WAGON on her right, the DRIVER squinting at a map while driving. A mattress and some furniture tied to the top SHIFT as the wagon hits a bump. 
SHAINA Um, Kimberly, your dad's not gonna call like every ten minutes is he? 
Before Kimberly can answer, Dano sees a CHP speeding up behind him. He lowers the joint at once. 
DANO (hiding bag of weed in pants) Shit! There's a cop behind us. Pull into the right lane now! 
Kimberly, scared, does as she's told nearly colliding with a speeding flat bed semi hauling a huge load of logs ! 
A HORN BLASTS. The truck swerves. Then speeds by on the right. A COILED CHAIN drops down to the highway. 
DANO Look first, idiot! 
Shaina turns up the radio and leans over to Kimberly. 
SHAINA Ignore 'em. 
ON LOG TRUCK 
One end of the RUSTY CHAIN holding the logs in place rattles on the pavement, sparking. 
Looking in her rearview mirror, Kimberly turns pale - the COP pulls in behind her. 
KIMBERLY Dano, put that out NOW. 
Dano takes one last drag and flicks the joint out the window. It bounces on the windshield of a FORD EXPEDITION to their left. 
INSIDE THE EXPEDITION 
KAT, 28, very corporate America, wears a navy blue power suit and speaks into a phone headset while smoking a cigarette. 
KAT 
No, I'm stuck on Jury Duty so I won't be able to pitch the campaign. Let's get Silverstein to come in and... 
Kat sees the joint that smoulders in the dried leaves beneath her windshield wipers. A moment later, a small FLAME crackles. 
KAT What the hell?     No,   not you. 
Kat flicks on her WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID, successfully putting out the joint, but her worn wipers smear ash and fluid around, impairing her vision. 
Kat turns and looks at -- 
DANO, dead serious all of a sudden. Staring straight ahead. 
DANO What's the cop doing?      Did he see that? 
Kat sees the tailgating CHP, smiles, then resumes her conversation. 
KAT Forget it, I'll call him myself. 
Kat hangs up, then looks down at her cell phone, squints and dials a number... 
PAN OFF KAT TO OFFICER THOMAS BURKE 
Early 20's, rookie cop, who seems to have missed the entire exchange. 
INSIDE THE POLICE CAR 
Thomas speaks into his radio. 
THOMAS I was supposed to be off today. How did I get screwed? 
DISPATCHER (O.S.) No biggie. Drake called in sick. 
THOMAS Copy that. (switches off; annoyed) Go on, sleep it off Drake. 
Thomas tries to sip from a McDonald's coffee cup on the dashboard, but it's TOO HOT. He places it back on the dash. 
The VIBRATIONS of the road make the COFFEE CUP slide closer and closer to the edge of the dashboard. 
BACK TO KIMBERLY'S SUV 
Dano nervously looks back. 
FRANKIE Relax, dude. 
But Kimberly still looks uneasy as her dashboard "Check Engine" light begins flickering. 
Kimberly spots a road sign -- Next Service 18 Miles. 
KIMBERLY This trip better be wor th it. What's the guy- girl ratio again? 
INSIDE TRANS AM 
Its driver, EVAN SCHAEFFER, 21, flashes a cocky smile at Kimberly, clearly making Frankie jealous. 
FRANKIE A Trans Am. That shit went out with New Kids on the Block. 
DANO 
Yeah. Who does he think he is? Knight Rider? 
FRANKIE (laughs; then) Who? 
Frankie leans out and tosses milkshake on Evan's window. 
DANO You know, Hasselhoff before he did Baywatch. 
Evan, pissed off, flips off Frankie. The windshield wipers smear around the thick milky fluid. The sun blinding him. 
KIMBERLY What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona? 
SHAINA How does a nice mature fuck sound? 
Kimberly laughs, then leans in close to Shaina. 
KIMBERLY Hey, thanks for talking    me into this trip. Ever since     my mom... I dunno, I just feel like    I'm starting to live again,    you know? 
Shaina smiles in understanding. 
INSIDE POLICE CRUISER 
Thomas bends to wipe up the mess. He only glances at the road as he tries to soak up the coffee. 
Suddenly up ahead, THE RUSTY CHAIN SNAPS! The logs roll off the side of the truck onto the highway. 
One bounces as it hits, and slams through Thomas' front winshield and out the back, taking Thomas' head with it. 
EUGENE slams on his brakes. His Harley slides out and he is SLAMMED to the ground, sliding at 60 miles per hour across the highway, right in front of the yellow mini-bus. 
The MINI- BUS DRIVER brakes to avoid Eugene. The FOOTBALL PLAYERS tumble forward and hit him in the head. He loses control and slides off the road onto the grass median. 
He blows a front tire and the mini-bus begins to flip, ROLLING several times int o the oncoming lanes of traffic, and is HIT by a MACK TRUCK. 
Eugene slides into a huge log, and hits it with a sickening crunch. Only to be HIT and CRUSHED by his sliding motorcycle. 
Rory looks up too late and REAR ENDS Thomas' car, EXPLODING the gas tank and HURLING Rory's dead body halfway through the windshield where it remains half in/half onto the hood. 
KAT, dialing, looks up, slams on her brakes, but SKIDS on oil from the Chevette. She swerves into Kimberly, SIDE SWIPES her, then swerves to miss a huge log -- only to run head on into two more, flipping the Expedition end over end right next to Kimberly. 
Kimberly swerves back from being hit by Kat, just in time to see a huge log ahead. She tries to turn hard to the right to avoid it, but hits it broadside -- 
Sending the SUV FLIPPING OVER the top of the log and SLIDING down the road. Inside, Shaina, Dano and Frankie are tossed around like rag dolls, shredded by glass and shrapnel -- Frankie is EJECTED out the side window. 
Kimberly's SUV slides to a stop on its side. She looks back to her mangled but still alive friends and up in time to see 
NORA'S PACER 
Nora sees the collisions ahead and slams on the brakes but the fallen Naya bottle prevents her from braking, and she SLAMS into the back of Kat's Expedition. 
The crash test dummy collision folds her Pacer and it EXPLODES into a huge fireball. 
EVAN, blinded by the smeared windshield, is too late. He swerves his Trans Am around the burning cars onto the wet grass. 
Kimberly sees the topless Trans Am slowly roll out of a huge WALL OF FIRE and coast to a stop. Evan comes up battered and bloody but still alive. He is trapped in his burning car, screaming and trying to release the seatbelt. 
Then, just when she thought it was over, a HUGE SEMI slides thro ugh the wall of fire, SMASHING the Trans Am out of the way, SPINNING it like a top. With the back sliding at 90 degrees it keeps on coming. 
KIMBERLY'S POV 
The semi's grill comes right at her! 
CU ON KIMBERLY 
She screams and we -- 
CUT TO: 
THE HIGHWAY O N RAMP - NISSAN SUV - 8 MINUTES EARLIER 
Sweating profusely, Kimberly's eyes dart around, taking in her surroundings... 
DANO (O.S.) Flight 180. You know, that plane crash with those kids from Mount Abraham. 
The Old Woman BUMPS the window - scaring the shit out of everyone. 
The kids ad-lib "Let's go" and "Fucking Freak!" 
KIMBERLY No!   We'll all die if we do! 
The cop turns on his FLASHERS. 
DANO I told you she'd ruin everything! 
SHAINA Shut up, Dano, just stay cool. (to Kimberly) He's just stoned. 
Officer Thomas Burke exits his car and approaches the passenger side of the SUV, hand on weapon. Thomas taps the window with his knuckle. 
THOMAS What's going on here? 
KIMBERLY (incoherent, through tears) There's going to be a pile up. Logs. Bodies everywhere. I saw it happen. It happened. 
Thomas looks to the guys in back who shrug, "we don't know her." 
THOMAS Miss, please step out of the vehicle. 
As she does, Thomas discretely unsnaps his holster. RORY nervously eyes the action. Sneaks a paper bundle into his sock. ISABELLA, the pregnant woman in the White Van, gets out. She gives Thomas her friendliest smile, milking the pregnant belly. 
ISABELLA Excuse me, but is there some way we could just drive around? I have a delivery. 
Her CELL PHONE RINGS and she leans back inside to answer it. 
ISABELLA Hey hon, you got a mysterious caller on the answering machine from Planned Parenthood. What's going on? 
As she listens, growing agitated, the Harley Rider dismounts and pulls off his helmet. Revealing EUGENE DIX, 35, a nebbishy school teacher in cool leathers. 
INSIDE PACER 
NORA watches the SUV, distressed. 
NORA What on Earth are they doing? 
TIM (picking up two Naya bottles) Who am I, David Blane? 
Nora gives Tim a hard stare, then they both break into smiles. Nora tousles his hair. And doesn't stop. 
TIM (good-natured laughter) Okay, quit it already. 
As he laughs, something pains his jaw and he winces. THOMAS isn't quite sure what kind of insanity he's dealing with yet. Dano and Frankie, no help, stare dead ahead. 
KIMBERLY (trying to calm herself) The radio played the same songs, the old lady's bag broke the exact same way it did in my premonition. 
Kimberly erupts into a panic when she sees the LOG TRUCK speed past. She grabs at Thomas for emphasis. 
KIMBERLY THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone! 
THOMAS Alright miss, calm down. I just need this lane open. I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder! 
KIMBERLY You're not listening to me!   You have to do something! 
EVAN impatiently yells out the window of his TRANS AM. 
EVAN Arrest this whack-job, wouldja? Some of us have lives, y'know. 
Kimberly looks to Shaina for support, but even Shaina can't meet her eyes. 
KIMBERLY Why won't anyone listen to me? 
Thomas, subtly reaching for his cuffs. 
THOMAS I'm not going to tell you to calm down again -- 
A SERIES OF CRASHES AND EXPLOSIONS ARE HEARD. In the distance. It's neverending. Horrific. Kimberly's face crumbles. She screams in horror and collapses against the SUV. 
Thomas runs to his patrol car. 
The White Delivery Van makes a J- turn out of the line of cars and SPEEDS down the onramp in reverse, Isabella screaming angrily into her cell phone. 
ISABELLA You couldn't keep your dick in check for a month?! 
The other drivers exit their cars, craning their necks to see what's happened up ahead. Kat takes a deep drag off her smoke. 
KAT Great, now I'm really gonna be late. 
Thomas barks into the radio handset -- 
THOMAS L.A. 51, I need assistance and requesting paramedics for a major T.A. At -- 
INSIDE THE SUV 
Frankie watches the traffic start to back up as a couple of passing cars BRAKE HARD. Shaina anxiously watches Kimberly pacing behind the SUV. 
SHAINA Kimberly, what's going on? 
DETECTIVE SUBY Officer Burke? Could I see you in here? 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The DOOR OPENS. Detective Suby enters, leading Thomas. Through a two - way mirror, they can see the others chatting anxiously. 
DETECTIVE SUBY Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again. (beat) Did you? 
THOMAS 
Of course not. That would be irresponsible and unprofessional. 
Detective Suby's persistent glare makes Thomas uncomfortable. 
THOMAS Look, you weren't there. It was weird. She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew. (beat) Never mind. 
DETECTIVE SUBY I thought we we re finished with this bullshit. This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line. 
But Thomas isn't listening. He's glued to Kimberly's words. When Detective Suby realizes this, he stops and listens. 
KIMBER LY But if I was never meant to pull over, then we all should have died in the pile up. 
TIM Which means Death could be coming for us. 
Detective Suby looks pissed o ff. 
DETECTIVE SUBY Way to console the witnesses Burke. 
At the same time, we watch Evan enter the other room, grab his jacket and wave goodbye to the others. 
DETECTIVE SUBY You got 'em thinking Death is after them? Shit, they're the luckiest sons o' bitches on the planet. Get this guy Evan Shaeffer; Yesterday the kid wins the lotto and today some looney bitch b locks traffic and he avoids the worst pile up in years. I should be so damn unlucky. 
INT. A ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Kimberly, Nora, Tim, Kat, Eugene and Rory now seem affected by what they've heard. 
KAT 
What if it's true? What if it's happening all over again? 
The fluorescent light above FLICKERS ominously. Nora, disturbed, stands up in a huff, grabbing Tim's arm. 
NORA You're all certifiable, you know that? I can't believe I've been listening to this crap. Come on, Tim, let's go outside. 
TIM Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'. 
EUGENE Look lady, we're just yankin' your chain. 
RORY Yeah, you're acting like we all just got the Diff'rent Strokes curse or something. 
Eugene and Rory burst out laughin g. Nora shakes her head, disgusted. 
NORA What's wrong with you people? 
Nora pulls a reluctant Tim out of the room. As she opens the door, the others watch Detective Suby and Thomas appear from nowhere to calm her down . When the door swings shut, an awkward silence. Suddenly, the door opens again and Thomas leads Mr. Burroughs inside. Mr. Burroughs sees Kimberly and chokes back tears. 
MR. BURROUGHS Kimberly... 
The sight of her fath er crying is enough to make Kimberly's own dam burst. She rushes over to him and buries her head in his chest, sobbing. 
MR. BURROUGHS Can I take her home? 
Thomas nods. 
DETECTIVE SUBY Sure, you can all go. 
By now, the fluorescent light flickers out of control. When Rory, Kat and Eugene stand up, Thomas looks helpless. 
KAT First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense. 
RORY Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season. 
As Thomas watches them file out, the fluorescent light POPS. Then DARKNESS. 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Kimberly sits at the table. Mr. Burroughs sets down a cup of tea before her. Both are shaken. 
KIMBERLY I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others. I've got this terrible feeling. 
MR. BURROUGHS What feeling? 
KIMBERLY That it's not over yet. 
She picks up the tea, it clatters in her trembling hands. 
Evan makes one last push with his foot - accidently flipping the SWITCH - the GARBAGE DISPOSAL GRINDS METAL! 
Evan, horrified, miraculously yanks his hand free, brushing against the knife in the toaster. 
When the SHOCK goes through Evan's body, his other hand jerks out, knocking the flaming frying pan to the floor. 
The entire kitchen is in flames, including the new TV blocking the door. The window slams SHUT! The room fills with smoke. 
EVAN Jesus Christ! 
Evan grabs a fire extinguisher. A mere dribble of foam comes out. He begins COUGHING in the smoke. 
Evan tries the window - STUCK! He has no choice but to smash the kitchenette window with the fire extinguisher to get to the fire escape. 
He dr ops the fire extinguisher, starts to climb out the window, hears a creak and looks up just as -- 
A large jagged shard of glass comes CRASHING down at him -- Evan jumps back just in time as it shatters before him. The fire completely engulfs the kitchen. 
He bravely jumps through the window pane, landing on the fire escape. He runs down the fire escape from floor to floor. 
A LARGE BLAST from his window showers him with glass and brick shrapnel, but ultimately, he makes it to the fire escape's lowest level, intact. 
He tries to lower the rusty metal ladder to the ground. It budges once, then twice, but won't go down. So he climbs over the railing and gently drops to the ground. 
Safe and sound, he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to walk -- 
SUDDENLY he s lips on the very grease he threw out the window, his legs shoot out from under him and he lands on his back. 
The rusty ladder suddenly dislodges and hurls downward -- coming right for Evan's face -- but stops halfway! 
As Evan laughs, breathing a final sigh of relief, it suddenly PLUMMETS again -- impaling Evan through his eye socket! 
INT. POLICE STATION - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT 
Thomas sits at the computer terminal. He checks to make sure no one's watching as he enters a SEARCH for Alex Browning. 
Ten websites come up, all devoted to the Flight 180 Curse. Thomas scrolls around, seeing the death pix and autopsy photos of Flight 180 "survivors". 
Headlines blare, "Freak Accident?" "Bizarre Coincidence?" describing the way the victims died. As Thomas begins a localized search of the word, "PREMONITION" -- 
SPOOKY HUMMING from behind him. 
Thomas whirls around to see Det. Suby looking over his shoulder, humming the music from an old monster movie. Suby presses one hand to his forehead, the other polishing an apple against his vest. 
DETECTIVE SUBY (as if entranced) Ooooh, I see it now. Your future... A transfer to another department. 
Suby bites the apple, casually offering nothing more. Thomas, embarrassed, flicks off the computer, stands. 
THOMAS You've made your point. 
DETECTIVE SUBY Good. Cause we just got some new info and I don't ne ed you getting freaky on me. 
THOMAS What? 
DETECTIVE SUBY Evan Shaeffer's dead. Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought. 
Detective Suby shrugs and walks away, munching the apple. Thomas looks stunned. 
INT. KAT'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Kat cradles a phone to her shoulder. She watches television and crushes Oreos into a bowl of ice- cream. 
KAT No, Mom. Just turn on any station, they've been playing it all day. (beat; rolls her eyes) Yes, Mother. Channel four will do just fine. Here it is, gotta go. 
She hangs up the phone, mesmerized by the report: 
FOOTAGE FROM A HELICOPTER shows the pile up wreckage. 
ANCHOR MAN (V.O.) Route 18 was backed up for almost nine hours today when a record breaking pile up... 
INT. NORA'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Nora and Tim watch the same report. 
ANCHOR MAN (V.O.) ...killed An estimated 18 people. Emergency crews spent hours sifting through the wreckage. 
INT. EUGENE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Eugene looks up from grading midterm bluebooks to watch. 
ANCHOR MAN (V.O.) ...hoping To recover any survivors from this tragic collision. So far, the police are refusing to release the names of the victims until their families are notified. 
INT. KIMBERLY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Mr. Burroughs numbly watches the same report. He doesn't see Kimberly enter behind him from the kitchen. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. KIMBERLY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
The room is dark except for one burning candle. Kimberly tosses and turns. The wind sends a single branch scraping against her window. A porch swing SQUEAKS back and forth. Adding to her anxiety. 
A BREEZE ENTERS, sputtering out the candle. Kimberly sits upright in bed and sees the WINDOW IS SHUT. Huh? She lights a match and sees the candle wax dripped onto her table, forming the gooey shape of a...180? The match goes out in her hand. The room is dark again. 
Headlights fr om passing cars cast eerie shadows on her ceiling. Shadows resembling PLANES seem to transform into a SKULL. 
Kimberly, freaked out, looks around to see the blinking light from the VCR: it flashes 18:0 a few times, then 12:00. 
She can't take it anymore. She yanks the VCR cord from the wall and flicks on the lights, ridding the room of shadows. And anxiously turns on her computer. 
EXT. STONEYBROOK HOSPITAL - DAY 
Kimberly drives a beat up Hyundai through an eerie morning mist that surrounds the grounds of the Stoneybrook Hospital. 
ANGLE ON 
A computer printout in the shotgun seat: MAPQUEST directions to "Stoneybrook Hospital". 
As Kimberly drives through the gate, the mist almost seems to follow her inside. 
A SIGN offers a choice between "Emergency/Medica l Care" or "Psychiatric Treatment Center." Kimberly drives to the mental ward. 
INT. MENTAL WARD - DAY 
A PHYSICIAN in a lab coat leads a nervous Kimberly down the center of a long corridor. The Physician consults a clipboard. 
PHYSICIAN ...at the request of the patient, you are to relinquish any sharp objects such as nail files, pencils, pens, safety pins, bobby pins, no matches, lighters, belts, belt buckles, earrings, chokers, shoelaces... 
Kimberly watches carefully as the Physician comes to a door and punches "4514" into the electronic lock. They continue down another corridor. 
Lights flicker,patients cackle and moan in the B.G. 
PHYSICIAN ...paper clips, watches, food, drinks, keys, poisons, pills and medications. (looks at Kimberly) You have a cell phone on you? 
Kimberly nods, hands it over. 
PHYSICIAN Then I think we're all done. 
They arrive at a door to a padded room. The Physician punches in another code. 
KIMBERLY Wait. Is she...dangerous or something? 
PHYSICIAN No honey, but she expects you are. 
KIMBERLY Jesus, how long are you going to keep her locked up this way? 
PHYSICIAN Depends on her, I guess.   She's voluntary. 
The door hisses open. 
INT. CLEAR'S PADDED ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
REVEAL CLEAR RIVERS 
While still beautiful, this young woman bears few traces of her former self. Her eyes dart around suspiciously, maddened by chronic paranoia. Her hair is patchy, her eyes dark and haunted. Bordering on savage. Her movements are fidgety, erratic, always distracted by something unseen. 
KIMBERLY Clear Rivers? 
Clear looks Kimberly up and down and steps back, allowing her inside her inner sanctum. A mattress on the floor, a plastic bottle of water, some paperbacks and a bedpan. 
Kimberly's jaw drops when she sees the far wall: a SHRINE to flight 180. The wall is papered with art icles about all the survivors (as seen in the opening title montage). 
The door SLAMS. Kimberly jumps. 
CLEAR Kimberly Burroughs, eh?    What do you want? 
KIMBERLY I thought...I thought you might be able to help me. 
CLEAR (snicker) Yeah, how? 
KIMBERLY I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up. .. I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me. 
CLEAR Nice work. Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me. (gives Kimberly the once over) But I doubt you'll survive that long. 
Kimberly flinches. 
KIMBERLY It's not just about me. Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident. What if the others are in danger, too? 
CLEAR Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up. 
KIMBERLY What list? 
THOMAS I tried calling last night but your father -- 
KIMBERLY Evan Shaeffer's dead. 
Thoma s nods and leans against the large glass windows that reflect the sky behind them. 
THOMAS I know. I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight. 
KIMBERLY Then you believe all this?? That Death is working off a list? 
Thomas hesitates before answering. 
THOMAS I didn't. Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors. 
KIMBERLY Clean up? I don't... 
Suddenly through the reflection of the window glass, Kimberly sees hundreds of pigeons dive bomb her at once! 
Like a scene out of THE BIRDS, Kimberly must duck and cover as the pigeons assault her from every angle. 
But when Kimberly turns away from the reflection, toward the actual pigeons, THEY'RE GONE. ALL IN HER HEAD. 
KI MBERLY Did you see that?? 
Thomas, concerned for her, saw nothing. 
KIMBERLY Pigeons... It's a sign! If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacke d by Pigeons! 
THOMAS I'm not following you -- 
KIMBERLY They're next on the list.   We have to find them. 
EXT. MEDICAL COMPLEX - DAY 
ANGLE ON 
Woman's N ike shoe on a down-moving escalator. Reveal Nora taking her son Tim to a dentist's office. The SHOELACE snags on a bolt of one of the steel side panels, untying it... 
TIM (mischievous smile) You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight? I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks. 
NORA Nice try, kiddo. 
Tim smiles, then winces from the pain in his mouth. 
THE DANGLING SHOELACE heads straight for the escalator grate. IT GETS SWALLOWED UP. As Tim steps off, Nora TRIPS forward. Her caught sneaker is pulled tighter into the innards of the metal staircase. 
TIM Mom! 
Tim watches helplessly as Nora reaches down, tug ging at her sneaker, fear mounting. Tim also grabs her sneaker and yanks. Finally, the shoelace SNAPS, and Nora's free again. 
TIM You okay? 
Nora puts on a brave face and begins tying one long shoelace to the stubby one. 
NORA Sure hon. I'm fine.   Let's shake it, we're late. 
Tim nods. The wind picks up as they continue past a -- 
CONSTRUCTION CREW 
Who apply industrial suction cups to large, thick sheets of PLATED GLASS . 
Tim stares in childlike fascination as they pass JACKHAMMERS, a CEMENT MIXER, and an EXCAVATOR. 
INT. CLEAR'S PADDED ROOM - DAY 
Clear Rivers applies fun- tack to the back of a newspaper article and sticks it on the wall devoted to Flight 180. 
REVEAL 
A photo of Eva, "Lotto Winner Killed By Ladder". 
Clear backs away, pausing to look at a group photo of the Survivors of Flight 180 just before take off. Smiling faces. 
TIM Not so much. 
Dr. Lees keeps a skeptical smile to himself. 
INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The RECEPTIONIST appears next to the fallen fish food with a VACUUM. She plugs it in an outlet below the fishtank. 
A startling GRIND as the vacuum turns on and coughs up a nail. She vacuums up the fish food around Nora's feet. 
The DEAD FISH gets sucked into the water filter in the fishtank which sputters and stops. The water level RISES, spilling water over the side of the tank. The water TRICKLES closer to the outlet. 
BACK IN DR. LEES' OFFICE 
SLOW DOLLY up to Tim. Choking, gurgling. His eyes are open, but rolled up. His hand limply reaches up...then drops. 
Sounds of commotion in the next room seem to fade away as we continue our SLOW DOLLY into Tim's eyes. 
They GLAZE OVER...the choking stops. And a HAND reaches into frame and pulls the puffer fish out of Tim's mouth. 
REVEAL JEAN looking petrified at the close call, looking around to make sure nobody saw... 
EXT. MEDICAL COMPLEX - LATER 
Nora and Tim, feeling better now, walk past the CONSTRUCTION CREW. A CRANE OPERATOR smiles at Tim, who smiles back. 
From across the mall, the tiny running figures of Kimberly and Thomas appear in the dis tance, pointing and screaming. 
TIM What are they doing here? And why are they yelling "pigeons"? 
Just then, Tim and Nora walk into a large cluster of PIGEONS who suddenly burst into flight, startling the Crane Operator, whose hand inadvertently jerks a lever - 
A METALLIC CHAIN RATTLE fills the air and Tim looks up just as a HUGE SHEET OF GLASS PLUMMETS downward toward him and CRUSHES him, his mangled body visible underneath. 
As two pearly whites roll around on the sidewalk, NORA SCREAMS. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. MEDICAL COMPLEX - LATER 
Emergency vehicles everywhere. Thomas seems exhausted as he walks back to Kimberly, who stands by his car. In the BG, EMTs load a stretcher into an ambulance. 
THOMAS (shaking his head) Nora's not coming. She refuses to leave her son. 
KIMBERLY We have to tell her she's in danger! 
THOMAS (sadly) I did. And right now, I don't think she cares. 
EXT. KIMBERLY'S HOUSE - DAY 
Thomas' car turns into the driveway and parks. Kimberly holds up her hand and watches it tremble. 
KIMBERLY It's happening again.   It's fucking 
happening again. I hoped we'd get there and they'd be okay, that Clear Rivers was full of shit and Evan's death was just a freak accident... 
Thomas kills the engine to listen. 
KIMBERLY But we're all going to die. We can't stop it. It's just a matter of time. I'm so scared. 
Thomas takes her hand and squeeze s it reassuringly. 
THOMAS I am too. But you can use that fear. It'll sharpen your instincts. Keep you alert fro signs. It's the only way you'll be able to sav e the others...and me. 
Kimberly, seeming overwhelmed, pulls her hand back. Thomas senses he's losing her, and softens her approach. 
THOMAS I know you didn't ask for any of this, Kimberly. But I don't think you have it in you to quit either. 
Kimberly stares straight ahead, the weight of the world sinking in. BANG! A startling pound on the roof of Thomas' car. 
Kimberly jumps, then spins around to see: 
CLEAR RIVERS - standing in the driveway. A determined, powerful presence. Kimberly exits the car. A MOMENT where Kimberly and Clear stare each other down. 
KIMBERLY Clear/Thomas. Thomas/Clear. 
Clear nods absently to Thomas, still focused on Kimberly. 
KIMBERLY (bitter) The second one just dies.   A 16 year old kid. 
CLEAR (nods; a faint trace of guilt) I hope you're ready for this. 
EXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 
Thomas' car pulls into a partially filled parking lot. Kimberly, Thomas and Clear file out and head to the door. 
KIMBERLY This is cheery. 
THOMAS Who is this guy, anyway? 
CLEAR A mortician. He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us. 
THOMAS Should we knock? 
CLEAR (looking ill) He probably already knows we're coming. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME - MOMENTS LATER 
MORTICIAN But be warned. To disrupt the grand design is to unravel the tapestry of the universe. When you pull all the threads apart, you may find yourself hanging from them. 
The Mortician finally lets Kimberly go. 
CLEAR One last question. Why is Death working backwards this time? 
The Mortician glances at his watch - Evan's bran d new Rolex. 
MORTICIAN (shakes head; a sick smile) Sorry, time's up. 
EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 
CLOSE UP - GAS DRIPPING 
From the nozzle in Thomas' car. Thomas fills the tank, watching for signs of danger. Clear's hand is poised over the gas pumps' EMERGENCY CUT-OFF VALVE 
Some SKATE RATS exit the mini -mart with a pack of Camels, followed by Kimberly, who carries a couple of Red Bulls and hands them out. 
THOMAS New life defeats death? Follow the signs? Where the hell did you find that guy? 
KIMBERLY Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful. 
CLEAR He was. If we can use your ability to see the signs, we can cheat Death long enough to figure out what "new life" means. (off their looks) I know, it worries me that I 
understand him. 
Thomas tops off the tank. Some gas spills to the ground. Quick looks all around -- sure enough, one of the Skate Rats is about to strike a match. 
CLEAR'S HAND SLAPS the kid in the back of the head, stopping him mid - motion. 
CLEAR What the fuck are you thinking? 
The startled Skate Rat shrinks back from Clear's rage. 
SKATE RAT I'm thinkin', suck my junk, bee yatch. 
Thomas chuckles to himself and looks at Kimberly who -- 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. LAKE - DAY 
POV DRIVER. Grease-covered female hands reach out toward a steering wheel of a white van speeding out of control TOWARD A LAKE! 
The van crashes through a railing and PLUNGES into the water. In moments, the van fills with water, the driver inside trapped. Drowning. Horrible. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. GAS STATION - DAY 
KIMBERLY 
Comes to Thomas' arms - GASPING uncontrollably for breath. Terror- stricken. She begins hyperventilating. 
THOMAS What is it? What did you see? 
It's so bad, Kimberly can't speak. She coughs and gags as if recently drowned. Clear scans the perimeter for immediate dangers. 
QUICK CUTS: 
A POWER REPAIRMAN 
On a cherry picker messes with the transformer, a LAWN BOY pull- starts a WEED WHACKER close to broken glass, a MECHANIC on a tall ladder changes out the gas price numbers, a female DOG WALKER with three dogs approaches the ladder. 
CLEAR 
You have to tell us now. 
KIMBERLY I...I... 
Clear shakes her head by the shoulders and barks commands like an angry drill sergeant. 
CLEAR You're strong. Do you hear me? You're a fucking warrior. Nothing scares you. In fact you happen to be the single most powerful woman on earth. Now what did you see? 
The words slowly take affect. Kimberly becomes centered, getting her breath back, and speaks without a hitch. 
KIMBERLY I was driving a white van. It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned. It was...horrible. 
CLEAR You were there? 
KIMBERLY I can practically taste the water in my throat. And something else. The smell of flowers... 
CLEAR (confused) Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition? 
Thomas gently releases her, paces. 
He makes a fist, is about to knock - when the DOOR FLINGS OPEN and a ROTTWEILER LUNGES for his throat - only to have its collar snagged at the last second by its owner - 
JORGE CRUZ, late 30's, handsome, cocky. He speaks above Rotty's BARKING: 
JORGE What? 
THOMAS I'm Officer Burke.    I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz. 
Suddenly, with an unexpected fury, Jorge SCREAMS at his dog. 
JORGE Shut up!!! 
The Rottweiler cowers, and Jorge shoves it to the floor, where it lands on its feet and fearfully trots away. Jorge's face is once again pleasant, but it's a thin veneer. 
Jorge sees Clear and Kimberly behind Thomas and frowns. 
THOMAS Are you Jorge Cruz? 
JORGE Maybe.   What's this about? 
THOMAS May we come in? 
JORGE No.   What's this about? 
ANGLE ON CLEAR - eyeing what appears to be DROPS OF BLOOD on the tile floor. She takes in what she can see of -- 
THE ROOM 
As if a tornado had hit it. Wedding photos smashed and torn. Furniture over-turned. 
THOMAS (a little stern) It's about your wife, Isabella. Now is she here? 
Jorge's eyes flicker ever -so- involuntarily behind him. 
JORGE No.   I'm alone. 
But by now, Thomas has seen everything Clear has and more. He stares through the house, into a bedroom and sees - 
A FEMALE FOOT lying half0buried under the bedspr ead. 
THOMAS Look, pal, it's probably nothing. But I need to see -- 
Jorge is already closing the door. 
JORGE Forget it. You'll need a warrant. I know, I'm a lawyer. 
Clear rushes the door, shoulders it and expertly wriggles past Jorge's grasp. 
JORGE Stop!!!   You can't go in there!!! 
Clear tears into the bedroom, grabs the bedspread and THROWS it to the floor to reveal a YOUNG WOMAN, naked, trembling with fear, takes a closer look at Clear. 
YOUNG WOMAN We never meant to hurt you Isa...You're not Isabella! 
Meanwhile, Jorge yells at Thomas. 
JORGE I'm going to sue your ass! 
KIMBERLY Whose blood is that on the floor? 
Defensively, Jorge holds up his arm. Freshly cut. 
JORGE Mine, you idiot. The dog went nuts this afternoon. Now arrest her! 
KIMBERLY Where's Isabella? Did you finally kill her you fucking wife beater? 
Jorge flinches. It's time to come clean. 
JORGE We had a fight. Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me. Wouldn't say where she was going. 
THOMAS What was the fight about? 
JORGE Take a guess. 
THOMAS Does she have a cell phone?   A way we can contact her? 
JORGE She did. 
He eyes a SHATTERED CELL PHONE on the floor. 
CLEAR We're wasting time with this piece of shit. Let's just get to the meeting. 
Jorge turns to soothe the frightened Young Woman in the bed. 
JORGE Hey, when you find her, tell her the kid's half mine. 
Eugene stares blankly at the CONCAVE MIRROR in the upper corner. He's disturbed by the WARPED REFLECTION OF: 
THE GAUNT MAN leans closer to Nora's hair and as the doors finally close, he leans over and SMELLS it. Creepy. 
EUGENE Um, by the way, your shoe's untied. 
Nora bends down to tie her shoelace (the one that snapped). She tries tying the long dangling shoelace to the stubby one as Eugene's cell phone VIBRATES in his hand. Startled, he drops it to the floor. Then looks embarrassed. 
EUGENE Probably for you, anyway. 
Nora picks it up. STATIC CRACKLES. It's hard to make out Thomas' yelling. 
NORA Officer Burke?   I can't hear... 
A beat of confusion, then she slowly turns to see the clawed hooks and hands of the Prosthetic limbs. Terror. She freezes. 
EUGENE What is it? What's wrong? 
But Nora's too frightened to speak. Eugene grabs the phone, hearing unintelligible STATIC. 
INTERCUT CLEAR 
As she frantically hits the elevator button. When it fails to come, she runs downstairs. 
INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 
Nora slowly rises to her feet, feverishly mouthing a prayer... As the door opens, Nora rushes out - unseen to her, her long braid gets snagged on one of the PROSTHETIC HOOKS, YANKING her backwards. 
NORA Let me go let me go! 
EUGENE Oh, watch it, you've caught your uh... 
The Guant Man's sweet voice and demeanor are a clear contrast to his outward appearance. 
MAN Goodness gracious, darling, let me help you with... 
Nora panic,s as Eugene and the Man try to untangle her braid. Nora desperately spins her body around, sticking her head back inside the elevator. 
Kat appears in the lobby, smoking a cigarette. 
KAT You alright, Nora? 
The elevator DOORS begin to close, and CLAMP around Nora's neck, her head inside, body outside the elevator. 
Eugene pounds on the BUMPERS, but they don't seem to work! 
NORA My God, someone please let me out of this -- 
INTERCUT 
The UP BUTTON is lit. Clear rushes to the lobby. 
The Elevator RISES! 
INSIDE THE ELEVATOR, Eugene watches Nora's head drop to floor level - then he pounds the Emergency Button - which SHORTS OUT! 
Nora's body lifts upwards from the force of the elevator floor! 
Nora's screams of terror and agony fill the air as the elevator repeatedly LURCHES UPWARDS. 
Kat gasps in horror to see this poor woman suspended above the floor. 
It lurches. And lurches. And lurches. The horror never ends. 
Clear comes from the stairwell and is shocked by the sight. She runs to the elevator doors, trying to pry them apart to no avail. 
All Kat can do, crying, is grab hold of Nora's flailing legs and try to pull her back down. 
The elevator lurches a final time. NORA'S HEADLESS BODY fall down into Kat's arms, knocking her to the floor. Kat freaks, skittering away as the body convulses. 
INSIDE THE ELEVATOR 
Eugene balls his hands to his mouth in undeniable fear. A bloodcurdling moan escapes him. He stares transfixed as Nora's head, still aghast in terror, rolls around the floor. 
The sight clearly sends Eugene over the edge. He SCREAMS, CLAWS AND POUNDS, desperate to escape the elevator. 
INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 
Eugene suddenly bursts through the door, babbling incoherently. Kimberly, Thomas and Rory look on, bewildered. 
EUGENE ...no escapes my ass. I control my fate. I die on my terms, hear me Reaper cockscuker?! 
Eugene's in another world. He approaches Thomas and lunges for his GUN - yanking it from the holster! 
THOMAS What the hell are you...? 
Rory cringes at his name, pockets his stash, then EXITS FRAME. WE PUSH IN, the news van gas tank is leaking. A SMALL DRIP... 
EXT. GIBBON'S FARM - CONTINUOUS 
Thomas, Kimberly, Clear and Rory watch the JAWS OF LIFE being clamped onto Kat's door. 
THOMAS Where's the cell phone Clear gave you? 
RORY I dunno. I think I gave it to Eugene back at your place. 
THOMAS Damn it. We have to call the Greenwood Police Station and warn Isabella. 
Thomas runs in the direction of some local POLICE. After he leaves, Rory drifts away from the pack, hand in pocket. 
Kimberly moves back to Kat, who chain -smokes in the front seat of the Expedition. 
KIMBERLY You doing alright in there? 
KAT My legs are starting to cramp up. And God, why am I so thirsty? Does anyone have any Fiji? 
The KA-CHUNK of the Jaws of Life next to Kat startles her half to death. 
KAT Christ, you wanna give me a heads up next time, pal? 
Brian and Mr. Gibbons approach with a cup of tap water. They hand it to kat, who frowns but drinks anyway. 
CUT TO: 
THE DRIP 
Of the leaking gas becomes a steady trickle. GAS SLITHERS over packed dirt, around debris, toward the crash site. 
BACK TO: 
THOMAS DARK ROOM 
Speaks to another COP who clicks off his radio. 
COP She's at Phelps Memorial. They're prepping her to give birth right now. 
THOMAS Where's that? 
COP A few miles up the road.   Near the docks. 
KAT 
Lights one cigarette off the other KA -CHUCNK! The sound makes her flinch, dropping the cigarette on the floor. 
KAT Damn, can't you be quieter with that thing? 
RESCUE WORKER (dripping scorn) Sure, I'll just set it to the "quiet" mode. 
Kat rescues the glowing cigarette from around her feet and inhales. KA-CHUNK!!! She jumps again, but maintains her composure. 
MEANWHILE 
The gasoline purposefully trickles down corrugated steel, through pipes, closer and closer to the Expedition. At one point, the gas even disappears into a hole in the ground, only to resurface twenty feet closer to the site... 
KIMBERLY 
Looks confused to watch Rory climb between the fence wires and drift the Dead Oak Tree into the field. Thomas runs down the hill toward Kimberly. 
THOMAS We gotta go now.   Isabella's in labor. 
Rescue Workers pull off a large chunk of door. KA-CHUNK! Kat Flinches. 
KIMBERLY What about that? 
CLEAR (calls over to Kat) How you doing in there, hero? 
KAT (re: spike behind head) I guess it could be worse. 
Brian hands out drinks to Rescue Workers. 
THOMAS So let's go...Where the hell is Rory?! 
Thomas sees Rory in the field and angrily hops the fence, heading directly under the dead Oak Tree. 
Rory, his back to everyone, finally opens the BINDLE. Enraptured, he delicately unfolds it... 
KIMBERLY 
Is put on alert by a fresh BREEZE. Her attention is caught by the WINDOW of an emergency vehicle. IN THE REFLECTION, Kimberly sees a man sitting on the Expedition, but when she spins ar ound, there's no one there. 
KA-CHUNG! The door comes off the Expedition, finally freeing Kat! Everyone applauds! 
The Nurse SNEEZES. 
ANESTHESIOLOGIST Goddamn it, keep her still! 
NURSE Sorry, doctor. 
XCU NEEDLE 
Tracing skin between Isabella's constantly moving vertebra. 
ANGLE ON BUMBLEBEE 
It buzzes about the room, darting between the he ads of the doctors and nurses, hovering above the -- 
ANESTHESIOLOGIST, who traces the long needle down Isabella's spine, finding the proper vertebrae. 
ANESTHESIOLOGIST Perfectly still now... 
Everyone freezes. SILENCE. As the tip of the needle presses the skin down -- 
The BEE lands on the Anesthesiologist's ear. And STINGS! 
FLINCH! 
The NEEDLE SINKS IN - a NURSE GASPS. Did something go wrong? 
ANESTHESIOLOGIST Done. (tears welling) Now could someone please find the open window and fucking close it? 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS 
Kimberly speeds the truck down some dangerously twisty roads slick from wet leaves. 
KIMBERLY This makes no sense. Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake. Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested? 
CLEAR I don't think so. Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we 
tried to change it. 
THOMAS Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can. 
CLEAR If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be... 
A somber beat. Then Thomas looks over at the speedometer. 
THOMAS Um, Kimberly? This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down. 
KIMBERLY Don't worry. Nothing can happen to us. 
THOMAS I wasn't worried about us. 
Suddenly, Kimberly clutches her throat! 
HARD CUT TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
UNKNOWN POV 
A NURSE hovers over us in a hospital, WRESTLING us down by the look of things. There is SCREAMING all around. The image comes at us so fast, we see only the briefest glimpse of the NAMETAG on her uniform: 
KALARJIAN 
THOMAS (O.S.) Kimberly! Slow down! 
BACK TO: 
INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS 
Kimberly "comes to" at the wheel -- FLAILING DESPERATELY at the steering wheel. She even claws at Thomas who tries to control the neglected steering wheel. 
CLEAR Slow down! We're... 
Kimberly looks up as the truck comes around a blind curve, where cars are backed up at a stop sign. Kimberly screams and SLAMS on the brakes. 
The truck SKIDS on wet leaves, completely out of control, towards a LANDSCAPING TRUCK parked on the shoulder. 
Kimberly's truck hits the loading ramps and launches itself twenty feet into the air, DUKES OF HAZZARD-style. 
And lands miraculously without a scratch! On a parallel road. And keeps going. Dumb, insane fucking luck. 
Kimberly shakes off her premonition and looks out the rear window. She turns around with a cocky smile. 
She rubs her throat and FLOORS IT again to Thomas' horror, more determined. 
CLEAR (eyes darting) What did you see? What am I looking for? 
ORDERLY Need a pen? Sure. If you like, I'll bring crosswords for you, too. 
Eugene tries nodding his thanks, but the tube in his throat hampers his movement. 
ANCHOR WOMAN (O.S.) ...police Have speculated that one of the deaths may have been 
narcotics related and urge children to stay away from d rugs. 
Finally, the Orderly pushes the cart away, revealing the TV. An ANCHOR MAN taps his pages on the desktop. 
ANCHOR MAN Good advice, Sue. And stay in school. Up next, Johnny Showers has the weather... 
A WEATHERMAN dressed as a frog points out cloud formations. 
Eugene, tormented, stares at the screen as the Orderly begins pushing the huge cart out of the room. 
The sound of a SKIDDING CAR fills the room. It comes from the TV which shows a PSA featuring CRASH TEST DUMMIES. 
ORDERLY Jeez, it's freezing in here. 
The Orderly flicks the thermostat and one by one, VENTS CLOSE just below the ceiling. 
Eugene's eyes fill with terror - he knows something's wrong. 
ANGLE ON OXYGEN HOSE - 
Bursting. It HISSES softly. We follow the OBLIVIOUS ORDERLY out of the room. 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 
A hospital ADMINISTRATOR briskly strides up to the Orderly. 
ADMINISTRATOR What are you doing? The Henzels are still waiting for you in the Children's Ward -- 
The Orderly smacks his forehead - shit. Totally forgot. 
ORDERLY Right, right, right.     Gregory's big day. 
ADMINISTRATOR And Mrs. Dempsey in hydrotherapy can't feel her legs. 
The Orderly, nodding rapidly, is halfway down the hall by now. The Administrator shakes his head in disgust and walks past. 
The HUGE CART. Which now blocks the door on Eugene's room. 
EXT. PHELPS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS 
Kimberly seems to have ditched the cops. She speeds the pick up through the medical facility. 
EXT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 
The pick up skids to a halt in front of the hospital. Kimberly, Thomas and Clear run outside and into the building. 
INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY 
The OXYGEN HOSE hisses, but is drowned out by the volume of the TV. Eugene's eyes dart frantically as a blaring fast food commercial ends. The n, a NEWS REPORT comes on. The BANNER: 
ROUTE 18 TRAGEDY 
Footage showing grieving families, wreaths on doors, yellow ribbons, and emergency crews pulling wreckage apart, dissolve together over: 
ANCHOR    WOMAN (O.S.) Mor e tears were    shed this morning in the wake of     yesterday's tragedy that rocked the     Tri -State area... 
Suddenly, the FRAYED ELECTRIC CORD of Eugene's TV begins sparking. The sound DROPS OUT, the picture SPUTTERS. 
Eugene goes white with terror. He looks back to -- 
The broken OXYGEN TUBE. HISSING softly. The BEEPS of the EEG machine frantically increase. Eugene reaches for the nurse call switch. Mockingly out of reach by mere millimeters. 
INT. NURSES STATION - DAY 
Clear, Kimberly and Thomas dash toward the main desk. 
CLEAR Isabella Cruz.    What room's she in? 
RECEPTIONIST I'm sorry, I can't give out that info unless you're a relative. 
CLEAR I'm her sister. 
The Receptionist eyes her dubiously. 
RECEPTIONIST I'll have to see your ID, Ms. Cruz. 
Clear vaults over the counter, straight-arms the Receptionist and seizes the computer. Thomas and Kimberly look on, stunned. 
CLEAR Delivery rooms are downstairs. I'll find Eugene and catch up with you. 
NURSE What are you doing in here?    Get the hell out! Right now! 
Finally we hear the BABY CRY! The Nurse immediately moves in to swaddle the newborn. Dr. Kalarjian beams at the very groggy looking Isabella. 
OBSTETRICIAN Isabella, look down and see your son. 
To the confusion of everyone around them, Kimberly and Thomas BURST INTO CHEERS! They jump, dance and hug each other. 
It's a magical moment -- 
EXT. EUGENE'S PRIVATE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The RAT stops gnawing. The TV stops sparking. A wave of intense relief washes over Eugene. He pantomimes reaching into his shirt pocket and lighting a victory cigar. 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 
Relaxed and invigorated, Kimberly and Thomas giddily exit the delivery room as Clear runs up to them. 
CLEAR A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene. 
THOMAS Don't sweat it.   It's over. 
CLEAR She had the baby? 
KIMBERLY New life defeats death. We've done it. Death has to rewrite the list. We're safe. 
Steve watches, confused, as Clear whoops with delight and HUGS the others. Clear laughs with a relief that seems completely foreign to her. Kimberly laughs with her, then is suddenly rocked by a vision -- 
HARD CUT TO: 
UNKOWN POV 
Looking up a the EEG machine. Flatlined! 
THOMAS (O.S.) Kimberly! Are you okay?! 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - BACK TO PRESENT 
Kimberly, on the ground, looks frazzled as she SNAPS out of her trance. Thomas helps her to her feet. 
THOMAS Are you okay? You just face planted! 
KIMBERLY I know how it feels to be dead. 
Her lips blue, Kimberly shivers uncontrollably. Clear sees TWO SECURITY GUARDS round a distant corner and quickly walks the others toward an EMERGENCY LOADING ZONE. 
CLEAR What did you see? 
KIMBERLY I was dead. And came back to life. An EEG machine. Where's Eugene? 
THOMAS But it's over. Isabella's baby was the key. You saw her die and everything, right? 
KIMBERLY I don't...what if I made a mistake? 
THOMAS Impossible. She was on the onramp. 
Kimberly reluctantly closes her eyes and remembers. 
CUT TO: 
PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN 
Moment of the pile-up premonition. A WHITE VAN in fr ont of Kimberly suddenly slams on its brakes and pulls onto the shoulder. 
Kimberly screams, swerving around the van just in time to avoid an accident. 
BACK TO: 
Kimberly, overcome with self- doubt. 
KIMBERLY I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile -up. 
THOMAS Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean? 
CLEAR Can you remember anything about it? 
Kimberly shuts her eyes, remembering: 
EXT. LAKE - DAY 
POV DRIVER 
Grease-covered hands reach out toward a steering wheel of a white van speeding out of control TOWARD A LAKE! 
The van crashes through a railing and PLUNGES into the water. In moments, the van fills with water, the driver inside trapped. Drowning. Horrible. 
THOMAS That's crazy. You can't give up now. We can still fight this thing. 
But Kimberly isn't listening. She stares through the glass doors at the -- 
AMBULANCE 
A red stripe down the side, but the hood is completely white. Six floral scented air-fresheners hang from the rearview. The 'van' from her vision! And it's running! 
KIMBERLY I have to do this. 
Kimberly wipes tears from her eyes, kisses Thomas' cheek, then turns and runs before he can speak. 
EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 
Kimberly heads right for the open ambulance. The driver's door almost seems to swing open for her as she gets in. 
INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 
Thomas frantically tries to get through the electric doors, which SPARK and short out. He struggles to pry them apart. 
EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 
Kimberly shifts into gear and speeds off. Thomas squeezes through the doors and runs after her. An EMT, the driver of the stolen ambulance, rushes outside. 
EMT What the fuck?! 
EXT. LAKE - DAY 
Thomas chases the ambulance, watching helplessly as it barrels over curbs, pylons and a fence, ultimately plunging straight into the lake! 
Thomas sprints to the lake as fast as he can - the EMT trailing far behind. 
INSIDE THE AMBULANCE 
Kimberly panics as the ambulance fills with water and she takes a final gasp of air -- 
ON THE LAKE'S EDGE 
Thomas stares in horror at the percolating air bubbles as the vehicle descends below the surface -- and he dives in! 
UNDERWATER 
Thomas swims into the dark, murky water. Deeper and deeper, he g ets to the ambulance and tries to open the door. Stuck. He withdraws his baton and BANGS on the glass - nothing! 
He tries coming up for air, but his pants snag on the jagged metal of the twisted bumper. He squirms frantically... 
And as his exhausted body loses consciousness, everything -- 
FADE TO BLACK. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
BLACKNESS. 
DR. KALARJIAN (O.S.) Ready and...CLEAR! 
The SHOCK of defribulator paddles brings Kimberly back to life. 
KIMBERLY'S POV 
Looking up at Dr. Kalarjian, all she can see is part of a woman's face and a partial nametage reading "Kalarjian". 
It would appear as if she's choking Kimberly, but -- 
An EEG MONITOR turns from a flatline to a steady heartbeat, the same POV as the premonition. 
NURSE She's back! 
DR. KALARJIAN Five CC's of narcodon. I want her stabilized and prepped for ICU. 
Kimberly turns her head to see 
THOMAS 
Unconscious, CPR being performed on him by the EMT (who's now soaking wet). Thomas doesn't respond. 
An INTERN opens an eyelid, points a flashlight at his eyes. Shakes his head, nothing. The sopping wet EMT goes back to performing CPR. 
Finally, Thomas coughs up water, chokes, gasps for air, then BOLTS UPRIGHT. 
THOMAS Kimberly?! 
He turns to see Kimberly reaching out for him. Immeasurably relieved, he takes her hand and allows himself to be eased back down to the platform. Kimberly's eyes fill with tears. 
KIMBERLY (whispering) Welcome back. We did it.           For real.

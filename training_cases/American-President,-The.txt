MAIN TITLES END ON 
EXT. BEAUTIFUL ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY 
It's an early November morning, and the sun has just come over this extraordinary building. WE HOLD on this for a moment before we 
CUT TO: 
INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE RESIDENCE - DAY 
A SECRET SERVICE AGENT presses the button by the private elevator as he talks into his shirt cuff. 
AGENT COOPER Liberty's moving. 
Another AGENT rounds the corner into the corridor and is followed a step or two later by 
PRESIDENT ANDREW BENJAMIN SHEPHERD. 
SHEPHERD's walking with his personal assistant, JANIE, a shy, professional and incredibly efficient 25-year-old. 
JANIE The 10:15 event's been moved inside to the Indian Treaty Room. 
SHEPHERD (to Janie) The 10:15 is American Fisheries? 
JANIE Yes, sir. They're giving you a 200-pound halibut. 
SHEPHERD Janie, make a note. We need to schedule more events where somebody gives me a really big fish. 
JANIE starts to make a note. 
JANIE Yes, sir. 
SHEPHERD Janie, I was kidding. 
JANIE Of course, sir. 
SHEPHERD (to the AGENT at the elevator) Hey, Cooper. 
AGENT COOPER 'Morning, Mr. President. 
SHEPHERD and JANIE enter the elevator. As the doors close... 
JANIE Mr. Rothschild asked to have a moment with you this morning. 
SHEPHERD Is he upset about the speech last night? 
JANIE He seemed concerned. 
SHEPHERD Well, it wouldn't be a Monday morning unless Lewis was concerned about something I did Sunday night. 
The elevator doors open, revealing LEWIS ROTHSCHILD. At 32, LEWIS is the President's chief domestic policy advisor. It would appear that he averages about two hours sleep a night, though that doesn't seem to slow him down. 
LEWIS You skipped the whole paragraph. 
SHEPHERD (to Janie) And Monday morning it is. 
LEWIS falls into the pace as the three of them head for the double doors leading to the South Lawn. 
LEWIS "American can no longer afford to pretend that they live in a great society"...and then nothing. You dumped the whole handguns paragraph. 
SHEPHERD This is a time for prudence, Lewis. 
LEWIS That was the kick-ass section. 
The three of them are now OUTSIDE and making their way down the COVERED WALKWAY that runs from the East Wing to the West Wing. 
SHEPHERD I thought what with being the President and all... 
LEWIS Sir, of course I didn't mean to imply-- 
SHEPHERD I thought you'd be turning cartwheels this morning, Lewis -- 63 percent job approval. 
LEWIS That's great news, sir, but... 
They walk past a GROUNDKEEPER who's at work at a patch of grass. 
GROUNDKEEPER 'Morning, Mr. President. 
Before he's even completed the last syllable of the greeting, JANIE quickly and quietly said-- 
JANIE Charlie. 
SHEPHERD 'Morning, Charlie. 
LEWIS Sir, the press is gonna need an explanation. 
SHEPHERD For what? 
SHEPHERD, LEWIS and JANIE walk through the door being held open by an AGENT. The conversation continues as they make their way through the corridors of 
INT. THE WEST WING - DAY 
SHEPHERD It would appear to be a letter from the entire environmental community. These people are outta control. 
A.J. I think they're just frustrated, Mr. President. 
ROBIN Are they blaming the President for global warming? 
A.J. Well, they don't think he caused it, if that's what you mean. 
(continuing; to SHEPHERD) Sir, I'm on the phone with these people twice a week. I honestly don't know what they want at this point. 
LEWIS What they want is a 20 percent reduction in fossil fuel emissions. 
A.J. It won't pass at 20 percent. 
LEWIS We haven't really tried. 
A.J. Lewis, McSorley, McCluskey and Shane hold too many markers. If we try to push this through and lose, there will be a very loud thud when we hit the ground, and that's not what you want in an election year. 
SHEPHERD Talk to the GDC again, A.J. Tell them the President resents the implication that he's turned his back on the environment. Tell them I'll send 455 to the floor. But we're gonna ask for a 10 percent reduction. If they want to pull their support, fine. At 63 percent job approval rating. I don't need their help getting a bill passed. We gotta get going-- where's Leon? 
A.J. (to an AIDE) Would you call Mr. Kodak and tell him the President's-- 
A.J.'s sentence is cut short by the sound of a head-on pedestrian collision in the outer office-- 
MRS. CHAPIL (O.S.) Aaagh! 
KODAK (O.S.) Sorry! Sorry, my fault. 
A.J. (to the AIDE) Never mind. 
LEON KODAK comes into the oval office. The White House pollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz. He, along with A.J., LEWIS, and ROBIN, are regarded as the President's Starting Team. The people in this room have grown very close over the past few years. 
KODAK Excuse me. Good morning, Mr. President. 
SHEPHERD You all right? 
KODAK They keep moving that big ficus plant. 
A.J. We're all here, Mr. President. 
SHEPHERD Okay. First, I wanted to say congratulations. Three years ago, we were elected to the White House by one of the narrowest margins in history, and today Kodak tells us 63 percent of registered voters think we're doing a good job. 
KODAK Wait a second. You wanted me to poll registered voters? 
Everyone LAUGHS... even SHEPHERD smiles... 
SHEPHERD But the poll also tells us what we already knew: We don't get this crime bill of ours through Congress and these numbers are gonna be a memory. So, starting today, we're shifting it into gear. 
ROBIN Can I tell my morning press gaggle that gun control-- 
A.J. Crime control, Robin. Gun control means we're wimps and we're soft on crime. 
LEWIS Hang on, are we not-- 
A.J. Lewis-- 
LEWIS Are we not putting back the handgun restrictions?! 
A.J. We're leaving 'em out. 
LEWIS Sir, we campaigned on this issue. Now, I understand we took it out when we were in the low forties, but we can push it through now. 
SHEPHERD After the elections. 
LEWIS Sir, we may never have an opportunity like this again. Let's take this 63 percent out for a spin and see what it can do. 
SHEPHERD We can't take it out for a spin, Lewis. We need it to get re-elected. For reasons passing understanding, people do not relate guns to gun-related crime. 
A.J. Robin, you can brief the press this afternoon. As of today, the crime bill's priority one on the President's domestic agenda. 
ROBIN Got it. 
A.J. Leon, you're gonna run the war room. We're gonna need detailed projections for all the target districts by the end of the week. And, Leon, don't be a nice, sweet guy from Brooklyn. Do what the N.R.A. does. 
KODAK Scare the shit out of 'em? 
A.J. Yeah. 
KODAK I can do that. 
A.J. Lewis, we want you to be legislative liaison on this. You're gonna run the show on the hill. 
LEWIS Can I just say, to return to the subject for one moment, that it might be easier to fight a war on drugs if we weren't arming drug dealers. 
SHEPHERD responds a little too quickly -- we see a spark of a temper. 
SHEPHERD Lewis, we've gotta fight the fights we can win. 
LEWIS Yes, sir. 
A.J. We want to announce the crime bill at the State of the Union, which is 72 days from today. The last nose count put us 18 votes short. 
SHEPHERD Eighteen votes in 72 days. Thank you, everyone. Janie, what's next? 
A.J. Thank you, Mr. President. 
The meeting's over. LEWIS, ROBIN, and KODAK say their "Thank you, Mr. President"'s as they exit. 
JANIE Security briefing, sir. 
CUT TO: 
LUCY Are my lips swollen? 
SHEPHERD Are they supposed to be? 
LUCY Yeah. 
SHEPHERD Then you're doing fine. 
LUCY Whatcha got behind your back? 
SHEPHERD A little gift. 
LUCY Is it a dirt bike? 
SHEPHERD Nope. 
He hands her an old textbook ... 
LUCY Is it a really old seventh-grade textbook of yours that you're gonna make me read cover to cover and discuss at dinner and drive me crazy with? 
SHEPHERD I'm not comfortable with the "really old" part, but everything else you said was true. 
LUCY (reading the cover) "Understanding the Constitution." 
SHEPHERD Your social studies teacher said your class would be starting on the Constitution this week. 
LUCY You talked to Mr. Linder? 
SHEPHERD Yes. It's called a Parent-Teacher Conference. Mr. Linder and I were the key player in that discussion. Why don't you like social studies, Luce? 
LUCY I like it fine, Dad. 
SHEPHERD All your other teachers say you're happy, you're enthusiastic, you've always got your hand up...Mr. Linder says you don't participate unless he calls on you, and even then it's a one-word answer. 
LUCY I don't know what to say, Dad. I guess I'm just not...I don't know. 
SHEPHERD Luce, take a look at this book. This is exciting stuff. It's about who we are and what we want. Read what it says on the first page. 
LUCY (reading) "Property of Gilmore Junior High School." 
SHEPHERD The next page. 
LUCY (reading) "We, the People, of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union..." 
SHEPHERD See? Grabs you right off the bat. It's a page-turner. 
LUCY I can't wait. 
SHEPHERD Good, 'cause it's possible the subject might come up at dinner tonight. 
LUCY Do you see it as part of your job to torture me? 
SHEPHERD No, it's just one of the perks. See you tonight. 
He gives her a kiss on the head and heads out the door. Behind him, he hears Lucy's rendition of "Hail to the Chief." SHEPHERD shoots her a look as we 
CUT TO: 
INT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT 
Where SHEPHERD is finishing a meeting with the DEFENSE SECRETARY, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS and a NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, each of whom is accompanied by at least one DEPUTY or AIDE. A.J. is also present. 
DEFENSE SECRETARY The C-STAD hardware's been in place for a month. We've got 22 instructors from the Army Air Defense School waiting to go down and train the Israelis. 
A.J. How soon can you deploy them? 
CHAIRMAN We can airlift 'em in the morning. They'll have C-STAD operational in 20 days. 
A.J. Any security concerns? 
SECURITY ADVISOR If anybody wanted to hit it, they'd have hit it by now. 
SHEPHERD Okay. Let's move on it. Thank you, gentlemen. 
SHEPHERD and A.J. leave the Cabinet Room amidst a volley of "good-bye" 's and "Thank you, Mr. President"'s. They pass MRS. CHAPIL and JANIE. 
SHEPHERD (continuing) Have a good evening, Mrs. Chapil. 
MRS. CHAPIL You too, Mr. President. 
SHEPHERD starts his walk from the West Wing back to the residence. 
It is the exact reverse of the path he took to the OVAL OFFICE in the morning. 
SHEPHERD I'll see you in the morning, Janie. 
JANIE You will, Mr. President. 
A SECRET SERVICE AGENT follows at a distance. 
AGENT #2 (sotto) Liberty is moving. 
A.J. Leo Solomon brought in a hired gun at the GDC. 
SHEPHERD It's about time. 
A.J. She's a lawyer from Virginia named Sydney Ellen Wade. I know this woman well. She's had a lot of success getting congressmen elected. 
SHEPHERD Maybe we should try to steal her. Ten percent, A.J. Don't let them leave the room till they're clear about that. 
A.J. You know, if you've got a free second, maybe you could stop in and say hello. It might smooth the way. 
SHEPHERD The GDC meeting. Right. 
CUT TO: 
INT. A.J.'s OFFICE - DAY 
A.J. Your concerns are not falling on deaf ears. The environmental lobby has known no greater alley in the White House than President Shepherd. 
SYDNEY Hardly an impressive distinction, A.J. 
SUSAN is trying to avert the inevitable-- 
SUSAN Sydney, we should leave Mr. MacInerney alone now. He's already given us more time than-- 
SYDNEY Susan, Mr. MacInerney doesn't want us to leave, because Mr. MacInerney's not yet done what he needs to do today. 
SUSAN Sir, Ms. Wade's been thrown into the deep end of the pool on her first day. She hasn't even had a chance to read the report of the Quebec Conference. 
SYDNEY -- whose brain is telling her to slam on the brakes, check her swing, smile and leave the building -- decides, instead, to hit the gas and swing away. The OTHERS are watching this as if they were watching the evolution of a train wreck. 
SYDNEY You're right. I haven't read it. If someone had asked me yesterday, I'd have told them the Quebec Conference was made up of six professional hockey teams. But what I do know is that it's time for the President to run for president again. Leon Kodak is as good as it gets when it comes to electoral strategy, and I'm certain he's told the President exactly what I'd tell him: Nail down Michigan and California, where they make cars and airplanes -- and burn plenty of fossil fuel. But if I had read these eight hundred pages, I would have discovered that it's the burning of fossil fuels that's been mostly responsible for global warming and that the 20 percent reduction recommended by the GDC is a necessary first step toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse effect that has gone unchecked by this administration... 
SUSAN (to SYDNEY) It's really time to-- 
SYDNEY Susan, I promise you, the White House Chief of Staff will not let us leave here until he's broken the bad news. 
No one in the room really understands what's going on... except A.J., who would like to take the time to admire SYDNEY but, of course, can't. 
A.J. (pause) I'm afraid Sydney's right. Although not about Michigan and California. The President has asked me to convey to you that he's sending his energy bill to the floor with a call for a reduction of 10 percent. 
There's an uncomfortable silence in the room... 
A.J. (continuing) The President is willing to go it alone on this, but he's asking for, and frankly he's expecting, the full support of the GDC. 
SYDNEY The President's expecting our full support? 
A.J. Yes, he is. 
SYDNEY The President's dreamin', A.J. 
SUSAN Sydney! 
SYDNEY --the President has critically misjudged reality. If he honestly thinks that the environmental community is going to whistle a happy tune while rallying support around this pitifully lame mockery of environmental leadership just because he's a nice guy and he's done better than his predecessors, then your boss is the Chief Executive of Fantasyland. 
VOICE (O.S.) Let's take him out back and beat the shit out of him. 
SYDNEY's blown out her speakers because she's turned in the direction of the private office entrance to see, live and in person, The President of the United States. 
She is frozen. Mortified. If she were capable of thought process, she would be preying for something heavy to fall on her head right now. 
A.J. Good morning, Mr. President. How are you today? 
SHEPHERD Couldn't be better. (to the GROUP) I apologize for the interruption, but A.J. asked me to stop and say hello. You wouldn't be Sydney Ellen Wade, by any chance, would you? 
SYDNEY Mr. President, I'm...don't know what to say. I'm speechless. 
SHEPHERD All evidence to the contrary. 
SUSAN Mr. President, we haven't met. My name is Susan Sloan. I used to work with Congressman Myers. I hope this episode in no way-- 
SHEPHERD Sydney? 
SYDNEY Yes, sir? 
SHEPHERD You got a second? 
SYDNEY (quietly) Of course. 
SYDNEY gets up to leave. SHEPHERD escorts her out of A.J.'s office and into the hallway. 
SHEPHERD I thought maybe we might have a word in private. Someplace a little less intimidating. (calling) Janie? 
JANIE Yes, sir. 
SHEPHERD (to SYDNEY) This is my personal assistant, Janie Basdin. Janie, would you show Ms. Wade into the rec room. I'll be there in a second. 
SHEPHERD enters a doorway off of the hall. SYDNEY continues down the hallway. 
JANIE (to SYDNEY) This way... 
JANIE leads SYDNEY into... 
INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY 
...where SYDNEY just stands uncomfortably, not knowing whether to sit or stand. Waiting. Trying -- the way a jumper on a window ledge tries not to look down -- trying not to notice things like the JFK Desk, the Seal of the President of the United States, the bust of Lincoln... 
SHEPHERD strides in-- 
SHEPHERD Sorry to keep you waiting. 
SYDNEY Mr. President-- 
SHEPHERD Is it okay if I call you Sydney? 
SYDNEY Of course. Mr. President-- 
SHEPHERD Have you ever been in the Oval Office? 
SYDNEY I've just been on the regular tour. It didn't include... 
SHEPHERD I hear it's pretty good. 
SYDNEY (quietly) My name's Sydney Ellen Wade. I'd like to-- 
OPERATOR (O.S.) (filtered) The President's expecting your call, ma'am. I'll put you right through. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SHEPHERD'S PRIVATE OFFICE/THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT 
He's just opened a bottle of beer when the phone rings. He picks up the phone-- 
SHEPHERD Hello. 
SYDNEY Mr. President, I'm sure there's an appropriate thing to say at this moment. Probably some formal apology for the nice-ass remark would be in order. I just don't quite know how to word it. 
SHEPHERD It's my fault. I shouldn't have called you at home. Should I call you at the office tomorrow? 
SYDNEY No, sir, of course not. I mean -- yes, you can call me anytime you want -- this is fine. Right now is fine. When I said "of course not," I meat that...You know what? The hell with it -- I'm moving to another country. 
SHEPHERD (smiling) What did you mean when you said you don't have a phone. 
SYDNEY I just moved to Washington over the weekend, and my apartment isn't ready yet. This is my sister's apartment. Come to think of it, how did you get this number? 
SHEPHERD (beat) How did I get the number. That's a reasonable question. I don't know. Probably the FBI. 
SYDNEY (trying to pretend it's just another guy on the phone) The FBI. Sure. 'Cause i-if you want to find someone and you're the president, that's who you would call. 
SHEPHERD You know who else is good at that? 
SYDNEY The C.I.A.? 
SHEPHERD Well, yeah, but I was thinking of the Internal Revenue Service. They have computer files that...Well...I should stop stalling. As I'm sure you know, the French have elected themselves a new president, and we're having a formal state dinner at the White House, and I was wondering -- and you're under no obligation at all -- but I thought it might be fun... I was wondering if you maybe wanted to go...with me, and uh... there it is. That's why I was calling. 
There's a long silence on the phone. 
SHEPHERD (continuing) Sydney? Sydney, Congress doesn't take this long to-- 
SYDNEY The President has asked me to join him in representing our country. I'm honored. I'm equal to the task. And I won't let you down, sir. 
SHEPHERD (beat) Sydney, this is just a dinner. We're not gonna be doing espionage or anything. 
SYDNEY No. Of course. I'm a little...uh...what do I do? I, I mean, where do I go? Should I meet you? Will you... 
SHEPHERD I'm gonna have a very nice woman named Marsha Bridgeport call you. She's the White House Social Director, and she'll help you with anything you want. Now when she calls you and tells you her name is Marsha Bridgeport, it'll help if you give her the benefit of the doubt. 
SYDNEY Of course. 
SHEPHERD I'll see you Thursday night. 
SYDNEY Mr. President, thank you for asking me. Really. This is a first for me. 
SHEPHERD Me too. 
They hang up. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 
INT. THE CRIME BILL WAR ROOM - DAY 
A large conference room at OEOB has been converted for the use of a half-dozen STAFFERS as well as ten or twelve interns, some of them high school age. A sign on a corkboard reads, "17 Votes in 69 Days." 
The two numbers are written on two separate pads of paper so that the top sheets can be torn off to reveal the following numbers in descending order. 
There is also a bulletin board that lists every member of the House of Representatives and is divided up into five columns: FOR, LEANING TOWARDS, UNDECIDED, LEANING AGAINST, and AGAINST. 
KODAK Who's on Indiana? (raising his voice) Excuse me. New people, I can't remember your names. Raise your hand if you're on Indiana. 
Two INTERNS raise their hands-- 
KODAK (continuing) Put your hands down -- you're on Illinois. 
LEWIS comes in. 
LEWIS We've got Jarrett. 
KODAK What? 
LEWIS George Jarrett. He's ours. Solid "yes." 
KODAK I don't believe it. (to an INTERN) You. New guy. "Jarrett, Democrat, Minnesota." Slide his name on over to "for." (to Lewis) We just had his name laminated under "Undecided." How'd you get the fence pole out of his butt? 
LEWIS I wish I could take credit. He just said, "Lewis, I support the President a hundred percent ." Not the bill, the President. 
LEWIS We're gonna win this in a walk. It's like a kissing booth at a carnival. Give us a vote, get a photo-op with number 63. 
LEWIS reaches to the tote board and pulls the "17" off, revealing "16." 
LEWIS We should have gone after the handguns. 
KODAK We gotta do one thing at a time. 
LEWIS We don't have time to do one thing at a time. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FOSSIL FUEL WAR ROOM - DAY 
A GDC conference room that SYDNEY, her assistant, DAVID, and two INTERNS have made into their 72-day headquarters. A similar tote board reads "23 Votes in 69 Days." 
The two interns are marking spreadsheets. DAVID is on one phone, SYDNEY is on another. 
A.J. Sydney, come on in. You look beautiful. 
SYDNEY Thank you. I have no idea what I'm doing here. 
A.J. I promise you there's no hidden agenda. 
SHEPHERD approaches SYDNEY. 
SHEPHERD Sydney. Andrew Shepherd. We spoke on the phone. 
SYDNEY Yes, sir. I remember. 
ESTHER, MACINERNERY, A.J.'S wife, joins them. 
A.J. You know my wife, Esther. 
SYDNEY Sure. It's nice to see you again. 
ESTHER (affectionately) Sydney, the President told me about how you two met. I think it's priceless. 
SYDNEY I don't know what happened. One minute I was calling him a mockery of an environmental leader. The next minute I had a date. 
ESTHER Men like being insulted by women. It makes them feel loved. Don't ask me why. 
A.J. Sydney, when you meet the French President, don't make him feel too loved, all right? We just signed a new trade agreement. 
SYDNEY Got it. 
The French President, D'ASTIER, and his WIFE approach. 
SHEPHERD (to D'Astier) Mr. President, would allow me to introduce Sydney Ellen Wade of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Sydney, this is President Rene-Jean D'Astier and his wife Monique Danielle D'Astier of France. 
SYDNEY An honor to meet you both. 
JANIE Mr. President, I'm sorry to interrupt. The receiving line is in place. 
SHEPHERD Sydney, it sounds like our table's ready. 
SHEPHERD's guests make their way out of the residence, leaving SHEPHERD with SYDNEY and the FRENCH PRESIDENT and MDME. D'ASTIER. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT 
SHEPHERD and SYDNEY are walking down the staircase that leads to the red-carpeted hall through which the President enters the East Room. 
The GROUP escorting the President gives them wide berth so that the two of them can have some privacy. 
SHEPHERD Once we hit the bottom of the stairs, I gotta do a thing. You'll be escorted... 
SYDNEY They took me through it. 
After a slight pause-- 
SYDNEY (continuing) Do you do this often, sir? 
SHEPHERD (beat) This is, actually, only our second State Dinner. The first was for the Emperor of Japan, who died shortly after that, so we stopped having them for a while, just in case. 
SYDNEY I meant do you go out on...do you-- often--do you-- 
SHEPHERD Do I date a lot? 
SYDNEY Well, yeah. 
SHEPHERD No. How 'bout you? 
SYDNEY Me? Lately, I seem to be going out on a lot of first dates. 
SHEPHERD Then you're experienced at this. 
SYDNEY Oh yeah, you can ask me anything. 
SHEPHERD How are we doing so far? 
SYDNEY It's hard to say at this point. So far it's just your typical first date stuff. 
And all of a sudden an INCREDIBLE SOUND from inside the East Room-- 
--The Marine Corps Brass and Percussion Ensemble plays four ruffles and flourishes. 
SHEPHERD Damn. And I wanted to find a way to be different from the other guys. 
A BOOMING VOICE over the P.A. announces-- 
VOICE (O.S.) Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. 
And now -- the whole walk timing out with incredible precision -- 
SHEPHERD By the way, nice shoes. 
--SHEPHERD walks into the hall as the Brass and Percussion Ensemble plays HAIL TO THE CHIEF. 
The 180 GUESTS come to their feet and applaud long and loud. 
The GROUP following the President catches up to the spot where SYDNEY has stopped walking. They all join in the applause. We can see in SYDNEY's face that she's been quite swept up.

The room is beautifully appointed, with the Marine Corps Dance Band playing dinner music -- and the SECRET SERVICE strategically positioned.

MRS. CHAPIL Good morning, Mr. President. Mr. Rothschild and Miss McCall are in the office, sir. They said they needed to speak with you before scheduling. 
SHEPHERD Fine. Janie, can you get me the number of a local florist? 
JANIE I'll take care of it, sir. Where do you want them sent? 
SHEPHERD I want to do it myself. I just need the phone number. 
JANIE I don't understand. 
SHEPHERD I want the phone number of a florist. 
JANIE You just want the phone number? 
SHEPHERD Yeah. 
JANIE (beat) I don't understand, sir, is there-- 
SHEPHERD I want to send some flowers, Janie. I want to do it myself. I don't want to staff it out, and I don't want to issue an Executive Order. I just want a phone number. 
JANIE I'll get it for you right away, sir.

ROBIN Mr. President, we need five minutes before scheduling if you can spare it.

JANIE enters and hands SHEPHERD a piece of paper. 
SHEPHERD (continuing) Thank you, Janie. 
She exits. 
LEWIS Who are we calling, sir? 
SHEPHERD I'm calling the Organization of the United Brotherhood of It's-None-of- Your-Damn-Business, Lewis. I'll be with you in a minute. 
LEWIS Yes, sir. 
LEWIS and ROBIN exit the Oval Office. SHEPHERD picks up the phone. 
SHEPHERD (to the OPERATOR) Yeah, good morning. How do I get an outside line? Really? That's simple. Thank you. 
SHEPHERD dials the phone number JANIE's given him.

ROBIN Does this have something to do with Sydney Wade? 
JANIE I'm really not at liberty to say. 
There's a quick knock at the door -- Leo's SECRETARY steps in with a strange-looking package. 
SYDNEY Leo, there is no relationship. It was one night. It's done. 
LEO'S SECRETARY Mr. Solomon, this was just delivered by White House messenger. It's marked "Perishable." 
LEO The White House has sent me something perishable? 
LEO'S SECRETARY It's for Ms. Wade. 
LEO Here we go... 
SYDNEY begins unwrapping the package. 
SYDNEY Relax, Leo. I'm sure it's just a formality. 
LEO'S SECRETARY (exited) It's from him. 
LEO Of course it's from him. 
SYDNEY So he had some staff flunky send me a fruit basket. 
LEO'S SECRETARY He wrote the note himself. 
SYDNEY I'm sure he didn't take the time to-- 
LEO'S SECRETARY The messenger said he was waiting in the Oval Office for ten minutes while the President wrote the card. 
SYDNEY Okay, listen, so he-- (to LEO'S SECRETARY) --it took him ten minutes to write a card?! 
LEO'S SECRETARY Apparently he went through several drafts. 
SYDNEY can't stifle her laugh -- she sees what the gift is. 
LEO What is it...what is it? 
SYDNEY A ham. 
LEO (beat) A ham? 
SYDNEY He sent me a Virginia ham.

SHEPHERD is conferring with LEWIS and ROBIN. 
ROBIN Sir, they're gonna be pressing today about whether the White House is prepared to soften the assault weapons section of the crime bill. 
LEWIS There is no need to entertain that at this point. 
ROBIN How do you want me to handle the Sydney issue? 
SHEPHERD The Sydney issue? 
LEWIS We should have a consensus on how the White House is going to handle it. 
SHEPHERD I sure hope the Sydney issue refers in some way to a problem we're having with Australia, because if it's anything else... 
JANIE pokes her head in. 
JANIE Mr. President, Ms. Wade is here to see you. 
SHEPHERD Tell her she can come right in. I'm finished here. 
JANIE Yes, sir. 
SHEPHERD (to LEWIS and ROBIN) There is no Sydney issue. 
SYDNEY enters, crossing paths with LEWIS and ROBIN. They exchange pleasantries. 
SYDNEY (to SHEPHERD) Thanks for seeing me on such short notice. 
SHEPHERD No problem. Did you get the ham? 
SYDNEY I got the ham, yes. Thank you very much. 
SHEPHERD I wanted to send you flowers, but there seem to be some kinks in the system. I'm really glad you stopped by. I had such a good time last night. 
SYDNEY So did I. It's just that... 
JANIE enters. 
JANIE They're 45 seconds away, sir. 
During the following, JANIE will go to the desk, pick up two briefing books and stick them in a briefcase and gather up his things -- all without interrupting the conversation a beat. 
SHEPHERD I'm delivering a luncheon speech at the Governor's Conference this morning. I'm sorry to--

STAFFER #1 So it comes down to character. 
STAFFER #2 The press like him, Senator. The networks, the newspapers, they're-- 
RUMSON Reporters like him. Networks and newspapers like ratings and circulation. For all the bitching we do about liberal bias in the press when it comes down to a character debate... 
STAFFER #3 The press is an unwitting accomplice. 
CARL Bob, the character debate didn't work out for us. 
RUMSON Because it couldn't. Our polling told us that attacking his character less than a year after he'd lost his wife was gonna be a turn-off and was gonna make people feel sorry for him. We couldn't run the campaign we wanted because the opponent was a widower. 
CARL He's still a widower. Time's passed, but-- 
RUMSON (to the rest) You'll have to forgive my friend. He's been on a hunting trip and cut off from the world.

SHEPHERD This isn't about Rumson. What I did tonight was not about political gain. 
KODAK But it can be, sir. What you did tonight was very presidential. 
SHEPHERD Leon, somewhere in Libyan right now there's a janitor working the night shift at the Libyan Intelligence Headquarters. He's going about his job 'cause he has no idea that in about an hour he's gonna die in a massive explosion.

SALLY Is there anything at all about the C-STAD weapons system that could have been mistaken by Libyan Intelligence as offensive rather than defensive? 
SHEPHERD No. We did everything but show them the blueprints. The hardware was sitting in a airplane hangar for a month. They didn't hit it until the 
American personnel got there. Leslie. 
LESLIE Sir, there's an unconfirmed report that you were with Sydney Wade when you learned of the attack. Can you comment? 
A.J. (sotto to ROBIN) Get him off. 
SHEPHERD Yes, we'd just finished dinner. 
ROBIN Last question. 
MARK Sir, would you care to comment on the status of your relationship? 
SHEPHERD We don't have a relationship. We just had dinner. 
CAROL Can you tell us if she spent the night at the White House or did-- 
ROBIN enters. 
ROBIN Good morning, Mr. President. Hi, Sydney. I came over as soon as Lewis called.

ROBIN I think the important thing is not to make it look like we're panicking. 
SHEPHERD See, and I think the important thing is actually not to be panicking.

LEWIS How do we exit Sydney from the building and what do we say to the press at that point? 
ROBIN We need a diversion. 
SYDNEY A diversion. 
ROBIN You understand that by diversion I'm not saying we set the White House on fire. 
SHEPHERD No, please, let's do. 
LEWIS Can I state very clearly that I can't be party to anything illegal. 
A.J. Good for you, Lewis. 
LEWIS Say what you want, but it's always the guy in my job that ends up doing eighteen months in Danbury Minimum Security Prison. 
SHEPHERD Rest easy, Lewis. We're not creating a diversion. 
ROBIN No diversion.

SHEPHERD regards A.J. for a moment...clearly the man planned ahead. 
LEWIS Okay. Good. Now, the press statement. 
SHEPHERD (to SYDNEY) Sydney, when you leave here, you're gonna run into reporters and photographers. Your picture's gonna be taken every day, and you're gonna be asked questions every day. Answer them, don't answer them -- it's entirely up to you. The White House has no official position except to say "no comment." 
ROBIN No comment? 
SHEPHERD The White House doesn't comment on the President's personal life. 
LEWIS We can't just leave it at that, sir. 
SHEPHERD I tell you what, Lewis, we just did. 
LEWIS But, sir... 
A.J. (the meeting's over) Thank you, Mr. President.

LEWIS Respectfully, sir. I think we should examine the new poll for more than its value as a box score. 
SHEPHERD Examine what? They don't like that I'm going out with Sydney. 
LEWIS It's not that simple, sir. I think this poll helps bribg a murky problem into specific relief. 
SHEPHERD Whose problem we talking about, Lewis? Yours? You worried about your job? This poll isn't talking about my Presidency. This poll is talking about my life. Two hundred and sixty-four million people have decided-- 
LEWIS Mr. President, two hundred and sixty- four million people don't give a damn about your life. They give a damn about their own. 
A.J. All right, that's enough. 
LEWIS Mr. President, you've raised a daughter almost entirely on your own, and she's terrific. What does it say to you that in the last seven weeks, 59 percent of this country has begun to question your family values? 
A.J. The President doesn't answer to you, Lewis. 
LEWIS Oh yes, he does, A.J.  I'm a citizen, this is my president, and in this country it is not only permissible to question our leaders, it is our responsibility. But you already know that, Mr. President, because you have a deeper love of this country than any man I've ever known, and I want to know what it says to you that in the past seven weeks 59 percent of Americans have begun to question your patriotism? 
SHEPHERD Look, if people want to listen to Bob Rumson-- 
LEWIS They don't have a choice! Rob Rumson's the only one doing the talking. People want leadership. And in the absence of genuine leadership, they will listen to anyone who steps up to the microphone. They want leadership, Mr. President. They're so thirsty for it, they'll crawl through the desert toward a mirage, and when they discover there's no water, they'll drink the sand. 
SHEPHERD (evenly) Lewis, we've had Presidents who were beloved, who couldn't find a coherent sentence with two hands and a flashlight. People don't drink the sand, 'cause they're thirsty, Lewis. They drink it 'cause they don't know the difference.

SHEPHERD (continuing) Have Lewis put the final drafts of the State of the Union and the Crime Bill announcement on my desk in the morning. 
A.J. Yes, sir. 
SHEPHERD gets to the doorway...stops...turns around... 
SHEPHERD If Mary hadn't died...would we have won three years ago? 
A.J. Would we have won? 
SHEPHERD If we'd had to go through a character debate three years ago, would we have won? 
A.J. I don't know. But I would've liked that campaign. If my friend Andy Shepherd had shown up, I would have liked that campaign. 
SHEPHERD looks away...nods absently... 
SHEPHERD (pause) Yeah. 
SHEPHERD exits, leaving A.J. alone as we 
CUT TO: 
INT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
A series of shots showing SHEPHERD walking down the corridor to the dish room, then walking down a long corridor which contains a series of paintings of various presidents. Then sitting alone in the Oval Office, lost in thought... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. RESIDENCE DINING ROOM - EARLY MORNING 
SHEPHERD and LUCY are eating breakfast in silence, neither of them very happy, each with their own problems. A nearby T.V. MONITOR glows with the live coverage of ROBIN's morning press briefing. 
Finally... 
SHEPHERD You're not hungry? 
LUCY This is oatmeal. 
SHEPHERD Yeah. 
LUCY We never have oatmeal. 
SHEPHERD It's good for you. 
LUCY I'm from Wisconsin. I need food. 
SHEPHERD You're not from Wisconsin. I'm from Wisconsin. You've lived in Washington your whole life. 
He glances toward the T.V. screen. ROBIN's standing up there doing what she's been told: "No comment...No, this President is not participating in character debates..." He mutes the volume. 
SHEPHERD (continuing) How are you doing in your Constitutional debates? 
LUCY We're done. 
SHEPHERD You're done? 
ANGLE - ROBIN 
who's picked up the receiver from a wall phone and punches in four numbers. 
She turns in to the wall to shield her conversation from the rest of the room. 
ROBIN (into phone) Lewis...call A.J. and come on down here...I don't know, but something's happening. 
SHEPHERD ...and although I have not been willing to engage in his attacks on me, I've been here three years and three days, and I can tell you without hesitation: Being President of this country is entirely about character. 
LEWIS enters with A.J. and KODAK. 
SHEPHERD (continuing) For the record: Yes, I am a card- carrying member of the A.C.L.U. But the more important question is why aren't you, Bob? This is an organization whose sole purpose is to defend the Bill of Rights, so it naturally begs the questions. 
SHEPHERD (continuing) Why would a senator, his party's most powerful spokesman and a candidate for president, choose to reject upholding the Constitution? If you can answer that question, then, folks, you're smarter than I am, because I didn't understand it until a couple of minutes ago. Everybody knows American isn't easy. America is advanced citizenship. 
SHEPHERD (continuing) You gotta want it bad, 'cause it's gonna put up a fight. It's gonna say, "You want free speech? Let's see you acknowledge a man whose words make your blood boil, who's standing center stage and advocating, at the top of his lungs, that which you would spend a lifetime opposing at the top of yours. You want to claim this land as the land of the free, then the symbol of your country can't just be a flag; the symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest." Show me that, defend that, celebrate that in your classrooms. Then you can stand up and sing about the land of the free. I've known Bob Rumson for years. I've been operating under the assumption that the reason Bob devotes so much time and energy to shouting at the rain was that he simply didn't get it. Well, I was wrong. 
SHEPHERD (continuing) Bob's problem isn't that he doesn't get it. Bob's problem is that he can't sell it. Nobody has ever won an election by talking about what I was just talking about. 
SHEPHERD (continuing) This is a country made up of people with hard jobs that they're terrified of losing. The roots of freedom are of little or no interest to them at the moment. We are a nation afraid to go out at night. We're a society that has assigned low priority to education and has looked the other way while our public schools have been decimated. We have serious problems to solve, and we need serious men to solve them. And whatever your particular problem is, friend, I promise you, Bob Rumson is not the least bit interested in solving it. He is interested in two things and two things only: Making you afraid of it and telling you who's to blame for it. That, ladies and gentlemen, is how you win elections. You gather a group of middle-aged, middle-class, middle- income voters who remember with longing an easier time, and you talk to them about family and American values and personal character. Then you have an old photo of the President's girlfriend. You scream about patriotism and you tell them she's to blame for their lot in life, you go on television and you call her a whore. Sydney Ellen Wade has done nothing to you, Bob. She has done nothing but put herself through law school, prosecute criminals for five years, represent the interests of public school teachers for two years, and lobby for the safety of our natural resources. 
SHEPHERD (continuing) You want a character debate? Fine, but you better stick with me, 'cause Sydney Ellen Wade is way out of your league. I've loved two women in my life. I lost one to cancer, and I lost the other 'cause I was so busy keeping my job I forgot to do my job. Well that ends right now. 
SHEPHERD (continuing) Tomorrow morning the White House is sending a bill to Congress for its consideration. It's White House Resolution 455, an energy bill requiring a 20 percent reduction of the emission of fossil fuels over the next ten years. It is by far the most aggressive stride ever taken in the fight to reverse the effects of global warming. The other piece of legislation is the crime bill. As of today it no longer exists. I'm throwing it out. I'm throwing it out and writing a law that makes sense. You cannot address crime prevention without getting rid of assault weapons and handguns. I consider them a threat to national security, and I will go door to door if I have to, but I'm gonna convince Americans that I'm right, and I'm gonna get the guns. We've got serous problems, and we need serious men, and if you want to talk about character, Bob, you'd better come at me with more than a burning flag and a membership card. If you want to talk about character and American values, fine. Just tell me where and when, and I'll show up. This is a time for serious men, Bob, and your fifteen minutes are up. My name's Andrew Shepherd, and I am the President. 
SHEPHERD exits the press room, leaving a stunned room in his wake. 
The MURMURS begin from the PRESS CORPS. They're talking among themselves, confirming that they just saw what they just saw. ROBIN steps to the podium. 
ROBIN Any questions? 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY - WEST WING - DAY 
A.J. and LEWIS are following after the President. 
A.J. Well, you don't see that every day of the week. 
LEWIS He's got the whole White House Press Corps asking each other how to spell "erudite." 
A.J. Lewis, call the printer. 
LEWIS I know. Gotta rewrite the State of the Union. 
A.J. Every word, Lewis. It's a whole new ball game. You've got 35 minutes. 
LEWIS Oh, good. I thought I was gonna be rushed. 
LEWIS goes off in one direction. A.J. heads towards the Oval Office. 
CUT TO: 
INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY 
SHEPHERD is on the phone. 
SHEPHERD I don't want the limo. I don't want an escort. 
A.J. enters. 
SHEPHERD (continuing) I want a plain, ordinary, non- bullet-proof automobile. Someone around here must have a Chevy I can borrow. Well, find one and meet me outside the West Wing entrance in five minutes. 
A.J. Where are you going? 
SHEPHERD I'm going to her house. I'm gonna stand at her front door till she lets me in. And I'm not leaving till I get her back. 
A.J. How're you gonna do that? 
SHEPHERD I haven't worked that out yet. But I'm sure groveling will be involved. 
A.J. You're just gonna drive over? 
SHEPHERD I'm the Commander-in-Chief of the most powerful army in the world. You don't think I can drive ten blocks? 
SYDNEY Just stay away from DuPont Circle. I hear it's murder this time of day. 
SHEPHERD doesn't need to turn around to know who's standing in the doorway, but of course he does anyway. 
SYDNEY Hi, A.J. 
A.J. It's nice to see you, Ms. Wade. If anybody needs me, I'll be in the Roosevelt Room, giving Lewis oxygen. 
A.J. exits. 
SYDNEY I heard your speech. I was in my car, and it just kind of steered its way over here. 
SHEPHERD I'm glad. 
SYDNEY and SHEPHERD just gaze at each other for a moment and smile. SYDNEY starts toward him. 
SHEPHERD (continuing) Sydney, I didn't decide to send 455 to the floor to get you back. 
SYDNEY I didn't come back 'cause you decided to send 455 to the floor. 
They move to kiss. It doesn't last very long because... 
LEWIS (entering) Mr. President, I thought you might want to look at this. I moved Social Security up front. Hello, Sydney. 
JANIE enters--

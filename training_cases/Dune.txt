REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.) (an excited whisper) A chance for escape? But for whom? 
15.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT 
EMPEROR Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank. 
NAVIGATOR LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life. 
16.  INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE  - NIGHT 
REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.) He shouldn't speak of this... 
15.  BACK TO SCENE 
NAVIGATOR ...gives the Bene Gesserit sisterhood the metaphysical ability to see beyond...to have superior powers... Our power to fold space is in the spice... Without us, your empire would be lost on isolated scattered planets... You would be lost. 
EMPEROR I can assure you... 
NAVIGATOR Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT... 
16.  BACK TO SCENE 
REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.) Here it comes... 
17.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT 
NAVIGATOR We ourselves... foresee a slight problem within House Atreides.... Paul.... Paul Atreides. 
EMPEROR You mean, of course, Duke Leto Atreides... his father. Page missing 24.  EXT. CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT 
High on the rock cliff stands Castle Caladan, Its appearance us dark and medieval. There is a window on the seaward wall lit from within... 
25.  INT. TRAINING ROOM - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT 
...by a drifting glowglobe. Paul sits at an L-shaped table studying filmbooks and maps of Arrakis and the Universe. 
25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK 
We SEE vast star fields and galaxies. 
25.  BACK TO SCENE 
PAUL (whispering) Here we are now... nineteen light years beyond... 
25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK 
We SEE the galaxies move as we HEAR a HUM. 
PAUL (V.O.) (whispering) ... beyond Epsilon Alangue... is Arrakis. 
We HOLD on this, then we see Arrakis grow larger in the filmbook screen and we SEE it is a planet of vast deserts. 
25.  BACK TO SCENE 
PAUL (whispering again) It does look dry.... 
25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK 
The picture grows larger again, and we see the Arrakeen Valley. FILMBOOK (V.O.) Each day the palms along the outer wall of the Palace at Arrakeen consume enough water to sustain the lives of one hundred men. The palms were placed by the Harkonnens to flaunt their water wealth in front of the city Fremen. 
25.  BACK TO SCENE 
PAUL Where are the Harkonnens from here? 
25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK 
The star fields and galaxies move slightly then. 
PAUL (V.O.) (whispering) There!... Geidi Prime and the Baron Harkonnen... the enemy. 
25.  BACK TO SCENE 
PAUL Well, how do the Fremen survive there? 
YUEH We don't know much about the Fremen... They live in the deep desert... some of them in the cities and they have blue- within-blue eyes... 
PAUL (smiling) The eyes -- yes, yes... saturation of the blood by the spice -- melange. Could the spice affect us in other ways? 
THUFIR Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily. 
PAUL (rising) The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke! 
Paul bows. 
THUFIR (CONT'D) Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence. 
PAUL I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going? 
THUFIR We have our new army. (in the same breath) Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him. 
Thufir, noticing a SQUAD OF GUARDS at the other end of the training room, calls out to them. 
THUFIR (CONT'D) Clear and lock the room. 
Gurney activates a series of locks.  LIGHTS GLOWS above each doorway. 
THUFIR (CONT'D) Activate a fighter. 
25C. ROBOT FIGHT 
Suddenly a FIGHTER ROBOT lowers from the ceiling. As the robot begins to rotate and go through several frightening, complicated movements, Dr. Yueh places a plastic device around Paul's neck.  He tightens it around the Adam's apple above Paul's voice box. Paul turns and emits a very strange, powerful sound through the weirding module as he rushes towards the robot. 
GURNEY (to Yueh) Precise control.... 
26.  INT. HALLWAY - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT 
The hallway is empty in the foreground but in the distance a changing of the guard is seen. 26A. through 26B.   (Deleted) 
27.  INT. HALLWAY - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT 
Paul walks down the stairway.  In the distance, moving troops are packing Atreides belongings. Beyond, Paul sees some troops carrying a large bull's head.  The horns are covered with dried blood. 
PAUL The bull that killed my grandfather... is this an evil omen? 
Suddenly, DUNCAN IDAHO appears from behind the giant black head. 
PAUL (happily) Duncan! 
DUNCAN Paul. (they shake hands) I was on my way to say goodbye to you.  I have to go on ahead. 
PAUL Why?  I wish you were coming with us. 
DUNCAN It's something for your father.  He wants to talk to you. (places hand on Paul's chest) I'll see you in Arrakis.  May the hand of God be with you. 
PAUL May the hand of God be with us all, Duncan. 
28.  EXT. CLIFF WALL - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT 
Paul walks to meet his father near the wall. 
PAUL (diffident) Father. 
DUKE LETO Thank you for joining me, Paul. (voice tired) It will be good to get to our new home and have all this upset behind us. 28A. (Deleted) 
28B. DUKE LETO AND PAUL AGAINST SEA 
They look out over the sea.  A huge wave crashes below. 
The Duke turns to Paul. 
DUKE LETO (CONT'D) (inner voice) My son. (out loud) Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides three generations....  He swears you are the finest student he's ever taught. Yueh, Gurney and Duncan say the same.... It makes me feel very proud... 
PAUL I want you to be proud of me. 
JESSICA I vowed never to regret my decision. I'll pay for my own mistakes. 
REVEREND MOTHER And your son will pay with you. 
42.  INT. DUKE LETO'S QUARTERS - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT 
Under a dim glowglobe, the DUKE is writing a note on a scroll-like piece of paper. 
Finishing reading, the Duke seals the message in a cylinder and presses his signet ring, with a red hawk symbol of House of Atreides, into a hole, which seals the cylinder with a swift HISSING. 
He pauses, studying the metal tube. With a VOICE COMMAND, he extinguishes the glowglobe above him. He leans back in his chair as lightning flashes outside the window. 
FADE TO: 
35.  BACK TO SCENE 
Paul enters the room and Jessica closes the door behind them. 
JESSICA Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you... (to Reverend Mother) Please... REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace. 
JESSICA Your Reverence. 
PAUL (inner voice) What does she fear? (out loud) What about my Father? 
JESSICA Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you. 
Jessica leaves the room. The Reverend Mother speaks to Paul using The Voice, a Bene Gesserit training which permits an adept to control others merely by selected tone shadings of the voice. It sounds as if two people are talking -- one normal and the other gutteral and slightly electronic. The effect is strange, yet subtle. 
REVEREND MOTHER (using The Voice) Now you come here. 
Paul finds he cannot help but obey her, yet he fights her controlling him. 
PAUL (inner voice) She's using The Voice. (out loud) No. 
She sees him struggling. 
REVEREND MOTHER (inner voice) Some strength there. Surprising! (out loud) Come here. 
The Reverend Mother holds up a green metal cube. 
REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D) See this... Put your right hand in the box. 
Paul stares at the hole in the box. PAUL What's in the box? 
REVEREND MOTHER Pain. 
Just then, she raises one hand to his neck. Paul sees a glint of metal. He tries to back away. 
REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D) (The Voice) STOP! Put your hand in the box. 
Paul's hand goes in. Fear passes over his face. 
PAUL (inner voice) The Voice again. 
REVEREND MOTHER I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals. 
PAUL Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal? 
REVEREND MOTHER Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat. 
PAUL (whispering) It burns. 
REVEREND MOTHER SILENCE... SILENCE. 
PAUL (inner voice)(struggling to compose himself) I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling. 
REVEREND MOTHER You feel the flesh crisping? 
36.  THE HAND - PAUL'S MENTAL IMAGE 
Paul's inner mind sees his hand on fire with all sorts of sores. The skin is bubbling. 
73.  INT. GENERATOR ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY 
Down in the basement, Atreides engineers are removing a complicated device from heavy machinery. A MAN radios back to Thufir. 
ATREIDES RADIO MAN We found and removed another sabotage device. I think it will go up now. The engineers activate a series of atometric Holtzman generators. Suddenly SOUNDS begin. The machines start; at first low, then they WHINE upwards to a high pitch. When the pitch is steady, a series of levers are pulled. 
74.  EXT. PALACE - ARRAKEEN - DAY 
Just after the second set of levers is pulled, a huge house shield is seen going up in a box shape, encompassing the Palace with SHIMMERING protection. 
75.  EXT. WINDOW - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY 
From a small window, Thufir observes the shield with a critical eye. 
THUFIR (inner voice; worried) We found these sabotage devices too easily... 
76.  INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY 
Two giant glowglobes drift into the Great Hall where Jessica and Dr. Yueh stand watching a giant bull's head is being hung above the massive fireplace. The MOVING TROOPS are unpacking crates and organizing furnishings. Jessica watches them. Distant SOUNDS reverberate inside an elaborate air vent beside them. 
DR. YUEH Listen here.... You can here the people of Arrakeen outside.... Can you here the cry "Soo Soo Sook" of the water sellers? 
JESSICA So many reminders of the scarcity of water. 
DR. YUEH Have you noticed the line of palms along the wall... the Harkonnen put them in... to flaunt their water wealth in front of these people.... Each day those palms take enough water to sustain the life of one hundred men. 
JESSICA The way you say Harkonnen... I didn't know you had so much reason to hate them. 
DR. YUEH (swiftly) My wife... you didn't know my wife... they... JESSICA (out loud) Forgive me... (inner voice) ... His wife was Bene Gesserit too... the signs are al over him.... They must have killed here. 
Jessica sees a droplet of sweat break out on Yueh's cheek. 
DR. YUEH I'm sorry I'm unable to talk about it. 
Above them a series of iron curtains begins to open over deep rock window slots, sending  narrow shafts of light down across the room. TWO ATREIDES WOMEN in uniform approach. 
ATREIDES WOMAN #1 (referring to several robed figures standing in the room) My lady... the local people... the maids and servants await your inspection. Hawat has cleared them. 
Dr. Yueh turns to Jessica. 
DR. YUEH The Harkonnens may have tampered medically.... please wait. 
He turns a yellow light on a moves it over the crowd. The yellow light beam plays over the blue- within-blue eyes. One of the women, the Shadout Mapes, watches Jessica continuously. Yueh's hand shakes slightly. 
JESSICA (inner voice; noticing Yueh's hands) He's hiding something -- holding something back. (She studies his face closely.) It's not just his wife... He's a good man though. He's probably trying to save my feelings... (We see her mouth.) I could use The Voice... make him tell me... It would only shame him. (We see her eyes.) I must place more trust in my friends. (We see Yueh turn toward her, fearful.) 77.  INT. PASSAGEWAY - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY 
Paul wanders through the darkened passageways alone, his footsteps echoing as goes. He takes pleasure observing the details of the rock Palace but all the while he feels an uneasiness -- a feeling of fear builds in him. 
78.  INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY 
Paul enters a small bedroom and sits down on the bed. He opens the filmbook, and activates it. 
78A. INSERT - FILMBOOK 
We SEE a gigantic carryall lower down above a spice harvester and pick it up off the desert floor as a narrator speaks over. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) One carryall handles four spice mining teams; however, it will fly only two harvesters at a time. Today, we have nine hundred and thirty harvesters and nine hundred and eighty-one carryalls.... 
78.  BACK TO SCENE 
Paul looks up. Across the room he sees a tray of small pastries which have been laid out. He goes to them and scans them with his poison detector, which he carries on his belt. A pleasant tone SOUNDS and the word "safe" appears in green light. Paul takes a pastry bites it and turns back towards the bed. Suddenly he stops. He looks at the pastry. 
PAUL (inner voice) Spice... 
As he continues eating he notices the sunlight through the slates over the window begins to GLOW white hot. Paul's eyes are intense as the light GLOWS brilliantly. 
PAUL (CONT'D) (whispering inner voice) Terrible purpose.... What is it?

Jessica continues to tremble. 
JESSICA (inner voice) I must speak with you Leto! 91.  INT. PASSAGEWAY - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY 
Outside in the passageway, feet suddenly move quietly toward the door to Jessica's room. 
92.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY 
Jessica HEARS this and looks up just as the Shadout Mapes silently enters her room. 
JESSICA (staring at the blue-eyed woman -- waiting for possible danger.) Yes? 
SHADOUT MAPES I am the Shadout Mapes, your housekeeper, Noble Born. What are your orders. 
JESSICA You may refer to me as "my lady." I am not noble born. I'm the bound concubine of Duke Leto -- mother of the heir designate.... "Shadout"... that's an ancient word. 
MAPES (strangely asked) You know the ancient tongues? 
JESSICA I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages. 
MAPES As the legend says. 
JESSICA (inner voice) That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham. (out loud) I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin. 
Mapes takes a step backward to flee. 
JESSICA (CONT'D) I know many things. I know you came prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice. MAPES My lady, I... the weapon was sent as a gift if you should prove to be the one. 
JESSICA And the means of my death should I prove otherwise. (inner voice) Now we will see which way the decision tips. 
Slowly Mapes reaches into her dress and brings out a sheathed knife. She unleashes it. 
MAPES Do you know this my lady? 
JESSICA (inner voice) It could only be one thing.... (out loud) It's a crysknife. 
MAPES Say it not lightly... (very slowly) Do you know its meaning? 
JESSICA (inner voice) Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death. (out loud) It's a maker... 
Mapes SCREAMS with elation and grief. 
JESSICA (CONT'D) (inner voice) Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close... (out loud) Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker? 
MAPES My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock. 
Mapes sheathes the blade... slowly JESSICA (inner voice) There's more here... yes! (out loud) Mapes, you've sheathed that blade unblooded. 
With a GASP Mapes drops the knife into Jessica's hands and opens her blouse. 
MAPES Take the water of my life! 
Jessica withdraws the knife from the sheath and, with the blade, scratches a line just above Mapes' right breast. 
MAPES (CONT'D) You are ours.... You are the one. 
PAUL No one. It... seemed the proper way. 
KYNES That it is. (inner voice) He shall know your ways as if born to them. 
Kyne's Fremen guard are watching Paul very closely now.

They crest the top of the wall which opens out into a black, level expanse of rock, cratered and fractured. On the other side is the huge, seemingly endless plain of sand, the Great Desert. In the hazy distance, flashes of light can be seen. 
96.  INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY 
PAUL Will we see a worm? 
KYNES Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms. 
PAUL Always? 
KYNES Always. 
PAUL Why do they come? 
KYNES To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. PAUL (inner voice) I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things. (out loud, suddenly) Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice? 
Kynes turns instantly and stares at Paul. Gurney sees the wonder in Kynes' eyes. 
GURNEY The young master is a trained Mentat, an advanced student of Prana Bindu has studied under some of the finest teachers in the Universe. 
Kynes takes a second look at young Paul. 
KYNES As I said... they defend the spice sands. As to their relationship with the spice... who knows.

98.  INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY 
GURNEY Dust cloud ahead, Sire. 
KYNES That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice. 
DUKE LETO Wormsign? Is it wormsign? KYNES Yes!... worm. Big one! You've got sharp eyes Sire.... May I? 
Kynes grabs the microphone and dials in the correct frequency. 
106. INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DESERT - DAY 
DUKE LETO (yelling at the men) Two men in each of the spotters... You!... over here... run!! 
The ground is really shaking now.  A tremendous low THUNDERING sound grows along with a high rasping HISS. 
KYNES (to Paul and Gurney -- yelling over the noise) I can't see him yet but he's very close... DUKE LETO (out loud to himself as he watches the men scrambling) Damn sloppy -- really damn sloppy. 
FOUR MEN begin tumbling into the Duke's machine. 
GURNEY Come on boys... come on. (Then, to the Duke) We're going to be heavy, Sire. 
The men press on Gurney and Paul.  Paul can feel the fear. The sound is a horrible ROAR and deeper RUMBLING now and the `thopter is vibrating and shaking violently.  The air suddenly begins to SPARK with static electricity. 
KYNES (nervous) Here he is... We've got to go. 
The Duke closes the doorways, surveys the area one last time, then takes the controls. 
106A.     INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY 
The ship strains and lifts off -- slowly. 
Paul sees the brown powder clumped on the suits of the men... their bluish eyes.  He smells the spice. He begins to feel its affect. 
PAUL (inner voice as a blinding light comes and goes) Spice!... pure un-refined spice! 
KYNES (murmuring) Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world. 
DUKE LETO (yelling) What's that you're saying? 
KYNES Nothing. 
A spice miner turns and sees Kynes, who remains silent. SPICE MINER #1 (astonished) Liet! 
SPICE MINER #2 Shhhhh. 
Paul hears this, then looks to Kynes -- locks on his image. 
PAUL (inner voice) Liet? 
KYNES (pointing down and yelling) You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch! 
Paul looks down as the Duke banks over the harvester. 
107. EXT. HARVESTER - DESERT - DAY 
Static electricity is IGNITING in the air and the sand is swirling around the harvester.  Then they see it.  A wide hole emerges from the sand, glistening spokes within it. The hole is twice the size of the harvester.  Suddenly the machine turns and slides into the hole, parts of it EXPLODING.  The SOUND is deafening.  The Duke's ship is WHINING to stay aloft. 
108. INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY 
GURNEY Gods, what a monster. 
DUKE LETO Someone is going to pay for this... I promise.

DUKE LETO (happily) Duncan!  What have you discovered about the Fremen, Duncan -- tell me.  Why haven't we heard from you? 
DUNCAN My lord... I suspect so much.  I think they are the allies we seek... they are strong and fierce... they do not give their loyalty easily or quickly....  As you know, the Imperium has never been able to take a census of the Fremen.  Everyone thinks that there are but few -- wandering here and there in the desert.... My lord, I suspect an incredible secret has been kept on this planet... that the Fremen exist in vast numbers... vast numbers... and it is they that control Arrakis.

Through the black smoke, large SARDAUKAR chase after THREE SOLDIERS and them with hydraulic knife-guns.  One blade enters the back of one man's head and comes out his nose.  Tremendous NOISE of battle.  Gurney and a squad of TROOPERS climb through bodies and thick smoke.  Gurney has the Duke's dog safely inside his coat.  The little dog's head sticks out -- looking about.  Gurney strokes the dog's neck when the reach safety behind some rock.  Small glimpses, as the smoke moves this way or that, let them see thousands of Sardaukar fighting.

She looks up. She sees the huge Baron Harkonnen staring down at her.  In the distance she HEARS the battle raging. BARON The drug was timed.  Dr. Yueh has been very valuable to us....

We move into Paul's eye, where the mouse moon appear and revolves slowly.  The moon begins to explode. The pieces of the moon soar toward us burning with white-hot flames.  Within the flames we see... 
139. (Deleted) 
139A.     EXT. ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT 
... the burning Palace of Arrakeen.  We move closer to it. 
189B.     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT 
We then see Duke Leto's face.  The Baron leans over the Duke and clutches the skin on the Duke's face. He begins pulling it.  The skin on the Duke's race slowly rips open -- making a hideous tearing SOUND. Black SMOKE issues forth from the hole which teats larger. 
PAUL (V.O.) (distorted) House Atreides is ruined. (less distorted) This moon holds my past. 
139C.     INT. VESTIBULE - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Inside and through the SMOKE Paul sees Feyd tear the Red Duke insignia off his father's uniform.  He sees Feyd laughing.  The moving, now-brilliant red hawk insignia becomes... 
139D.     EXT. CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT 
... a burning meteor ROARING over the castle on Caladan.  The meteor crashes in the black sea. 
PAUL (V.O.) This moon holds my future. 139E.     INT. WATER - NIGHT 
Foaming confusion turning into a small, twisting fetus under the sea.  Its eyes closed.  Moving close to it, its eyes snap open.  Through the eyes is the pale white face of JESSICA. 
139F.     EXT. SHIELD WALL - DESERT - NIGHT 
There is a huge soaring WIND sound and beyond JESSICA the dunes roll like ocean waves. 
139G.     EXT. MOUSE MOON - NIGHT 
The moon continues to spew out pieces of moving images which are seen then disappear as fast as sparks.  The broken, burning pieces float eerily toward us over the undulating dunes below.  One image floats closer.  It is a hand folded into a fist. 
PAUL (V.O.) I am only a seed... 
The fist begins to open. 
DUKE LETO (V.O.) The seed must grow. 
The hand opens fully with slow blue fluid pulsating out the very center of the palm.  The hand floats eerily forward. 
DUKE LETO (V.O.) The sleeper must awaken. 
139H.     EXT. WATER - NIGHT 
The last image which passes is foaming and spitting dark blue water.  As the image passes, the black smoke trailing behind it obscures the picture to blackness. 
140. EXT. ROCK - DESERT - NIGHT 
Through the darkness we move to Paul's clenched hand.  It opens, revealing the signet ring in the very center of his palm.  Paul looks upward to the moons of Arrakis.  He looks back to the ring, then to his mother. 
Paul plants the thumper which begins a powerful rhythmic noise.  He turns to Jessica. 
PAUL (returning) Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper. 
JESSICA (puts in her noseplug) I'm ready. 
Paul and Jessica move into camera and exit right. 
151B.     EXT. DEEP DESERT AND ROCKS - NIGHT 
Another burst of LIGHTNING.  The distant rock seems to have grown no larger.  Their muscles begin to ache.  Suddenly they HEAR the thumper start behind them. 
PAUL Keep going... 
152. EXT. DEEP DESERT AND ROCKS - NIGHT (LATER) 
Their breathing becomes very labored.  The sand moves like slow water, forever rolling down and up. Then they hear the worm, the low thundering HISS shaking the tonnage of sand.  The thumper stops. Paul turns. 
PAUL Faster!! JESSICA (screaming) It's deafening! 
Their bodies ache and they feel like dropping, yet the cliff is still a good distance away.  The worm SOUND grows louder and Paul turns to look. 
153. EXT. WORM - DESERT - NIGHT 
A flash of LIGHTNING.  The worm is now coming toward them.  The mound of sand over the worm is enormous and is approaching at a terrifyingly fast speed. The power of this worm is awesome. 
153A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - NIGHT 
PAUL (screaming) Run! 
JESSICA I can't... I can't. 
She turns to see.  Then she runs. 
153B.     EXT. DRUM SAND - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT 
All at once their feet tromp down on firmer sand. The SOUND is very loud. 
PAUL Drum sand! 
The DRUMMING sound ECHOES deep within the ground. Jessica falls.  Paul stops and drags her up.  They run again.  The worm SOUND becomes unbearably loud. Static electricity SPARKS giant bolts of pure white LIGHTNING and the air turns to ozone.  Finally they find rock.  Behind them the SOUND of the worm changes.  They turn. 
154. EXT. WORM - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT 
The gigantic head of the worm is just breaking through the sand.  The mouth begins to open in an eighty-foot circle of teeth and darkness.  The mouth arches forward searching for them. 
155. EXT. BASE OF THE CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT 
Paul and Jessica climb up and up inside a narrow slit of rock. 155A.     INT. ROCK CLIFF - DESERT - NIGHT 
The worm's mouth climbs higher also but it cannot penetrate the narrow opening in the rock. 
156. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT 
Paul and Jessica have scrambled upwards a couple of hundred feet. 
156A.     EXT. WORM AND ROCK - NIGHT 
Still the worm stretches up to them.  Suddenly the worm begins BANGING on the rock.  Huge SHUDDERS drive through the black stone.  Over and over again the worm mindlessly hits at the rock. 
156B.     EXT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT 
Paul and Jessica crouch further back in the tiny passageway of safety, but a solid back wall of rock prevents them from moving back any more. 
156C.     INT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT 
The breath from the worm is like a hurricane of WIND. 
PAUL (inner voice) Cinnamon... the spice! (out loud) Do you smell it? 
JESSICA Yes... 
JESSICA Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit. 
A FREMEN It is the legend. 
167. EXT. CLIFF - FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT 
Up on the rock, Paul turns.  He takes a step, then notices a small figure standing in front of him.  It is a girl. 
CHANI I am Chani, daughter of Liet....  I would not have permitted you to harm my tribe. 
PAUL (inner voice) From my dream... so beautiful.  Liet.... is this Kynes' daughter? 
Paul stares at her in wonder. CHANI Come with me.  I'll show you an easier way down. 
They exit. 
168. EXT. FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT 
STILGAR (to Paul, as they meet) You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly. 
PAUL (thinking) What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon? 
STILGAR We call that one Muad'dib. 
PAUL Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib? 
STILGAR You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us....  We welcome you. 
Wind blows a cloud of dust through the rock.  High above the moon with the mouse shadow glows brilliantly.  It dissolves into the sun. 
168A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY 
Paul, Jessica and the Fremen march through the dunes. 
171. through 171B.  (Deleted) 
172. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DUSK/SUNSET 
HEAT WAVES and sand dunes.  Mysterious SOUNDS echo in the distance as the giant sun is setting. 
Chani takes Paul to the top of a dune.  They stare at the sunset and a huge rock outcropping in the distance. CHANI Seitch Tabr. 
Paul looks at the rock, then turns to her. 
CHANI (CONT'D) Tell me of your homeworld, Usul. 
These words rend Paul's soul.  He cannot speak.  He reaches out and touches her hand - her cheek. 
173. (Deleted) 
174. INT. ENTRANCE - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT 
The Fremen troop enters into a large square room with slot passageways going off in various directions. 
175. INT. PASSAGEWAY - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT 
They all move down one of the passageways which are beautifully but very plainly cut with lasguns.  They are like passages in the pyramids, dark with sharp turns and inclines upwards or downwards, some very steep and long, and others descending hundreds of feet.  There is a strong, moaning WIND. 
176. through 177.   (Deleted) 
178. INT. PASSAGEWAY/STAIRS - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT 
A quiet WIND can be heard -- deep and moaning. 
JESSICA Moisture... 
She looks at Paul.  He, too, notices. 
PAUL Wind traps... huge ones. 
Down a long, sloping, narrow passageway they go until they reach a stairway cut into the stone.  It is very dark and gets increasingly darker as they descend.  The WIND sound grows.  The air grows colder and damper.  Paul and Jessica share another questioning look.  At the bottom of the stairs they pass through a narrow slot doorway which suddenly opens out on something so totally unexpected it shocks Paul. 179. INT. RESERVOIR  -SIETCH TABR - NIGHT 
DISSOLVE TO: 
183. through 187.   (Deleted) 188. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT 
Fremen carry the Fremen REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO in on a litter.  The old Reverend Mother is old a frail yet extremely beautiful and mysterious.  She turns to Paul and Jessica with a strange look. 
REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO (to Jessica, in an ancient voice) So you are the ones. 
She turns away towards the monks who are very busy blowing horns and waving pots of burning spice, purifying the area of the rite.  Several Fremen blow on dip sticks and a FEMALE CHOIR begins a haunting chorale as the giant pipe organ blows beautiful low notes below. 
Paul looks to his mother. 
He then sees Chani. 
CU Chani. 
CU Paul -- he cannot stop looking at her. 
Stilgar motions to Paul. 
STILGAR (whispering to Paul) Do you know the Water of Life?... Come... ...Watch... the mystery of mysteries... the end and the beginning. 
He shows Paul through a narrow passageway -- almost a slot through the stone to a small room.  Through an opening in the stone wall, Paul is shown a very strange and somewhat horrifying scene. 
189. INT. BABY WORM - MAKER ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT 
A thirty-foot baby worm is being lowered into a stone chamber.  The chamber is then covered with a wire top.  Valves are turned and water rushes into the chamber.  The worm begins to writhe violently and leap and bang against the bars above.  The worm begins to turn inside out from the mouth back and it begins to gag.  Some monks and watermasters quickly drain the stone chamber and wrench the worm out using large steel hooks.  They hold the worm above a large tub.  A watermaster-reed man runs a long reed in to the worm, causing it to spasm and gag up a beautiful deep blue bile as it dies. 
189A.     INT. MAKER ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT 
The bile and worm water are combined in ceremonial containers.  Paul turns to Stilgar. STILGAR The Water of Life. 
PAUL (inner voice) The most lethal poison in the Universe. 
Then we HEAR from Paul's memory his conversation with the Reverend Mother: 
REVEREND MOTHER ... Many men have tried. 
PAUL Did they try and fail? 
REVEREND MOTHER They tried and died. 
190. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT 
Stilgar and Paul return to the ledge above the Hall of Rites.  A MONK PRIEST steps forward, addresses the crowd, silencing them.  The other monks move back carrying their smoking cleansing bags. 
MONK #1 One among us has consented to enter the rite.  She will attempt to pass within that we not lose the strength of our Reverend Mother. 
PAUL (inner voice)(turning to his mother) What if she should fail? 
He brings the jug close to Jessica. 
MONK #1 Drink! 
Jessica drinks. 
JESSICA (inner voice) The ultimate awareness spectrum narcotic. I must transform the poison configuration within my body... the blue must be made clean. 
She swallows.  Her body contorts and spasms violently.  She screams.  The Reverend Mother screams with her. 191  (Deleted) 
192. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT 
We see Jessica sitting, shoulders tight and spasming -- straining, her eyelids half-closed and flickering.

170. INT. BASEMENT ROOM - GEIDI PRIME - DAY 
Nefud stands eating candies behind Thufir's chair. Nefud has a stun gun, even though Thufir's hands are tied.  The Baron enters with Feyd. 
BARON Oh Thufir, I see they've installed your heart plug already....  Don't be angry. Everyone gets one here.  But this is not why we're here.  We've brought you a little cat, Thufir.  You must care for it if you wish to live.  A poison has been introduced into you, Thufir Hawat.  By milking this smooth little cat body each day you receive your antidote... it must be done each day....  Also, you must do something for me if you wish to live.  You know I lost Piter, my dear Mentat... 
Thufir gives the Baron a weak, wide-eyed stare. 
FEYD All I can see is an Atreides that I want to kill. 
BARON Feyd, no, no!  Thufir's a Harkonnen now, aren't you Thufir? 
THUFIR (inner voice) My dear Duke... how I have failed you. 211. INT. JESSICA'S ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT 
Jessica's face shows signs of straining.  Women move around her, Chani and Harah at her side, helping her give birth.  Suddenly ALIA is born and her freshly- born moist body is held up in front of Jessica. Alia's eyes snap open, burning brightly. 
HARAH What will you call her? 
JESSICA Alia. 
As they lift Alia for Jessica to see... 
ALIA Mother. 
210. INT. TRAINING ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT 
Paul walks down the steps into the training room - followed by Harah's two sons.  He pauses at the foot of the steps. 
PAUL Activate your weirding modules... 
Paul activates his, and the Fremens follow suit. 
PAUL Set the range for two meters. 
Paul walks down the line of Fremen. 
PAUL Korba... (points to robot) The arm... 
KORBA (aiming the module) Chuuk-sa... 
PAUL Motion... Chuuk-sa... 
KORBA Chuuuk-sa... 
He fires the module and the arm of the robot is shot off.  Paul smiles and hits him on the shoulder - Paul walks on. PAUL Stilgar... 
One of the FREMEN calls out to Paul. 
A FREMEN Muad'dib!... 
The word `Muad'dib' causes a tremendous power to build.  The module shakes violently in his hand - it suddenly fires upwards, and the wall explodes. 
PAUL (inner voice) My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well? 
211A.     NEW SCENE 
STILGAR (to Paul as he applies red colour to the shoulders of several large Fremen men) Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin. 
He pauses, then holds up his brilliantly red hand. 
212. (Deleted) 
213. EXT. DESERT - DAY 
An EXPLOSION.  Paul turns and his eyes are totally blue.  He lifts binoculars to them and looks.  He sees the Fremen fighters below charging at the Harkonnens.  As the Fremen run they make powerful SOUNDS with their weirding modules, exploding everything in their path and catching things on fire. 
213A.     EXT. CARRYALL - DESERT - DAY 
In the distance, a huge spice carryall is shot down and it falls to the ground EXPLODING more violently on impact. 
213. BACK TO SCENE

A furious Rabban sirs in a black steel tub in the Great Hall.  A squad of TROOPS stands at attention in front of him, listening to his screaming fit. 
RABBAN Falsify the reports.  We can't hide it all, tell them we've lost only two hundred harvesters... and forty carryalls... and don't let my uncle know about the destruction of the spice silos....  I will catch this Muad'dib and suck the blood from him!!  SUCK THE BLOOD FROM HIM!!! 219J. through 222.  (Deleted)

226B.     EXT. DESERT - DAY 
Fighting is going on between Fremen and some smugglers.  Paul moves down a smokey dune with Stilgar followed by Fremen and Fedaykin. 
PAUL We surprised a band of smugglers. 
STILGAR (racing into thick smoke) Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen. 
Paul and Stilgar move through the smoke.  A man runs up with a maula pistol aimed at Paul but Paul spins and punctures the man's chest with a sound from his weirding module.  Paul turns and a large figure comes through the smoke.  They surprise each other. The figure holds a gun. 
PAUL Gurney!... 
The figure stops -- stunned. 
PAUL (CONT'D) You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck. 
GURNEY (peering; whisper of hope) Paul!!  Paul!! 
PAUL Don't you trust your own eyes. 
GURNEY They said you were dead.  They said... 
Paul shows him the signet ring on his fingers. Gurney moves forward, his eyes tearing, and the two embrace each other and pound each other on the back. 
GURNEY You young pup!  You young pup! 227. NEW SCENE - WORLD REPORT

The Emperor sits on his throne.  Behind him are his Sardaukar officers.  In front of him are several Guildsmen.  One holds a large electrical apparatus up to the face plate of another which translates his strange voice into English. 
TANKED GUILDSMAN #2 Emperor Shaddam IV... You have one last chance to take matters into your own hands and bring the situation under the control on Arrakis. 
EMPEROR What do you mean one last... 
TANKED GUILDSMAN #2 Do not speak!...  Listen!...  You do not have more than this one chance....  I represent the entire Guild in this matter....  You have failed to kill the Atreides heir... Paul. 
EMPEROR But he was said to... 
TANKED GUILDSMEN #2 (moans like a cow) Noooooo... he is not dead.  He is not eaten by worms as you have wanted to believe.  He is not missing.  He is in the deep desert with the Fremen.  The Spice is in great danger.  We are not asking... we are telling... remedy the situation or you will live out your life in a pain amplifier. 
The Guildsmen turn and leave. 
EMPEROR Who is this Paula Atreides to the Guild? And why? 
Cut to Paul screaming horribly in the desert.

Alia walks forward in the very dark room.  Blood rushes from her nose.  She forces herself to walk to Jessica's bed.  She finds that Jessica's nose is bleeding also.  Jessica wakes in pain.  They stare at each other in the darkness. 
JESSICA ALIA! 
ALIA Mother - help me!

Navigator chewing giant eye and spewing blood and light and sounds.  Paul's mouth double exposes over Navigator and eye.  The sound from Paul's mouth destroys the Navigator and opens the Alam.

Chani looks to the Fedaykin, then they look at Paul who lies motionless.  She cuts the rope bonds with her crysknife.  Her fingers tremble as does the whole of the desert. 
Paul's eyes snap open.  He sits up slowly.  Chani stares at him in awe. 
CHANI Paul... Paul. 240B.     EXT. WAVE CRASHING 
A huge wave crashes and Paul sees the image of his father.  Paul slowly gets to his knees, then stands.

The storm is howling now.  Sand blasts against rock and rips pieces away. 
267. INT. STEEL TENT - EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - DAY 
EMPEROR Bring in that floating fat man... the Baron. 
The Baron is brought in.  Distant warning SIGNALS begin.  The Baron is fighting to contain his fear because RABBAN'S HEAD SITS ALL BLOODY ON THE FLOOR in front of him.  Finally the Emperor speaks. 
EMPEROR Why have you brought me here? 
BARON Your Highness... There must be some mistake... I never requested your presence. 
EMPEROR Ah?  But your lack of action demanded it. Your dreadful mismanagement, your bad judgement in assigning to Rabban -- (he gestures toward the head) -- the governorship....  You forced me to come here and set things straight... personally. A VOICE Bring in the messenger. 
Alia is brought in by the Sardaukar soldiers.  She is smiling. 
ALIA I am the messenger from Muad'dib.  Poor Emperor, I'm afraid my brother won't be very pleased with you. 
EMPEROR Silence!...  I do not court your brother's pleasure. 
Suddenly the Reverend Mother looks horrified and grabs her throat. 
REVEREND MOTHER (struggling, speaking) Kill this child!!  She's an abomination!! Kill her. (points to Alia, who is smiling at her) Get out of my mind!!! 
ALIA Not until you tell them both who I really am. 
REVEREND MOTHER (strained speech void of emotion) Sister of Paul Muad'dib. 
The Reverend Mother slumps.  The Baron's mouth flies open.  The Emperor's face goes pale, his lips tremble. 
EMPEROR Paul's sister... Paul is Muad'dib?! 
He turns quickly and looks at the two Guild agents present in the room.  They stare at him icily.  Alia is smiles happily. 
268. INT. COMMUNICATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN - DAY 
Paul smiles. 
PAUL (laughs)(to Gurney and Stilgar) Alia keeps pace with the storm. Gurney and Stilgar don't understand.  Suddenly enormous dust clouds and LIGHTNING sweep up over the Shield Wall.

Gurney gives a hand signal and... 
GURNEY (they put on their hoods) Atomics! 
269. EXT. SHIELD WALL - ARRAKEEN - DAY 
...TWENTY EXPLOSIONS of hydrogen bomb intensity go off in a row, cutting a huge gorge through the width of the massive Shield Wall.  As the EXPLOSIONS go off, a WIND howls, destroying much of Arrakeen and covering the rest with tons of sand.  Sand rips at the Palace and the Emperor's ship. 
270. INT. STEEL TENT - EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - DAY 
Alia smiles as they HEAR the tremendous roaring, atomic screams of the explosions.  The Emperor's ship's warning SIGNALS are now close and loud. 
ALIA My brother is coming... with many Fremen warriors. 
A Sardaukar rushes in. 
SARDAUKAR OFFICER #2 The Shield Wall is gone. 
EMPEROR Impossible! 
ALIA Not impossible.  I told you... He is here now. 
SARDAUKAR OFFICER #2 Majesty, into the ship! 
EMPEROR (to his officers)(rising) Release the Sardaukar.  Baron... give this little abomination to the storm. 
They all leave the room, including the Sardaukars. 270A. through 271.  (Deleted) 
Thufir approaches Paul, concealing the knife.  They come face to face.  The Emperor seems strangely tense at this moment.  Paul notices this.  He looks Thufir over. 
PAUL (CONT'D) (inner voice) A knife.... (out loud) In payment of the many years of service to my family, you may know ask of me anything you wish.  Anything at all. (quietly) Do you need my life, old friend? 
He turns his back on him. 
PAUL (CONT'D) (quiet) It is yours. 
Thufir's eyes grow sad and wide. 
PAUL I mean this, Thufir.  If you are to strike, do it now. 
Thufir's hand rises, as Jessica gasps, but the old Mentat pulls his heart plug out with a quick tearing motion.  Paul turns and catches him as he sags. 
His head lolls back and he looks up to Paul urgently. THUFIR (CONT'D) Three... generations... of you... 
His breath escapes him and he is dead. 
PAUL (to the guards) Carry this noble Atreides warrior away. Do him all honor. 
The guards do as they are instructed. 
PAUL Emperor Shadam the IV... there are Guild Heighliners above us containing many Great Houses of the Lansraad....  SEND THEM BACK! 
EMPEROR How dare you speak to me... 
GUILDSMAN #2 (speaking into electric microphone) Stop your speaking!! 
PAUL (to the Guildsmen) Good.  You have some idea of what I would do but I will tell it to one who has never been seen... one who hides deep in the Heighliner control rooms.  He will hear it first. 
GUILDSMEN #3 (fear) No! 
Paul smiles as we move closer and closer to him. 
282. INT. CONTROL ROOM - HEIGHLINER - SPACE 
Suddenly we are in the Heighliner control room, near the floor in the chemical spills.  We move up into the orange gas.  THUNDERING begins to shake the Heighliner. 
PAUL (V.O.) Where are you....  Let me see you or there will be no spice. We move into very thick gas and there is a ROARING. Suddenly Paul sees the Third Stage Navigator. 
PAUL (V.O.)(CONT'D) You know what I'm about to say is true.... I have the power to destroy the spice forever. 
The Guild Navigator's mouth stretches back in a horrible MOAN.  The moan becomes more pained and grows louder and louder. 
283. INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY 
The Guildsmen in the room are MOANING and SCREAMING and swarming out towards the doorway -- the Fremen stop them.  The Emperor and all are amazed and frightened.  There is a long hush.  The old Reverend Mother then turns and glares at Paul. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours. 
REVEREND MOTHER Stop him, Jessica! 
JESSICA Stop him yourself. 
PAUL You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand. 
REVEREND MOTHER You mustn't speak of... 
PAUL (using The Voice) SILENCE! 
The old woman is shot backwards by the power of his shout.  Her breath is knocked out of her. 
PAUL (CONT'D) I remember your gom jabbar, now you remember mine.  I can kill with a word. A Fedaykin stand forward and recites from the prophecy. 
FEDAYKIN #1 ...and his word shall carry death eternal to those who stand against the righteous.

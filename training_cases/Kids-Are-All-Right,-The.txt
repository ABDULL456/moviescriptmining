JULES Laser, no phone calls at the table. 
LASER (into phone) Lemme hit you back. 
Laser hangs up.   Nic re-enters with a large glass of red. NIC (sitting down) Who was that? LASER Nobody.    Clay. 
Jules and Nic share a look. Jules starts making maternal windshield wiper strokes with her thumb on Laser's arm. JULES Can I ask you something? What do you get from your relationship with Clay? LASER What do you mean, "get"? 
Laser looks down at Jules' thumb on his arm. JULES Do you feel like he's the kind of person who will help you grow? LASER Mom, you're windshield wiping me. 
NIC Hey, did you start on those thank- you notes for your birthday gifts? 
JONI Not yet.   But I will... 
NIC I just think it's easier to knock them out when it's fresh. JONI Yeah, I know, I'll do them tonight. 
NIC Great...I mean, you don't want to have to start with an apology. You know? Then it's embarrassing. JULES Okay, honey. She got it. Let it go. NIC Okay, I'll let it go... (then) I mean, if it was up to you, our kids wouldn't even write thank-you notes, they'd just send out good vibes. 
Nic takes another swig of vino and smiles at Joni through increasingly plum-stained teeth. NIC (CONT'D) I can't believe my baby's 18. 
JULES I know... 
NIC (devolving into baby talk) Big girl. You're a big girl... JONI Mom... 
Joni mimes wiping her teeth.   Embarrassed, Nic starts licking at her stained teeth. 
INT. JONI'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT As Joni cranks out thank-you notes, Laser enters. 
JONI What? Laser looks nervous. 
LASER Have you thought any more about, you know, making that call...? JONI Yeah.   I don't want to. 
LASER Okay...I was just wondering if you changed your mind. 
JONI I haven't. 
He starts to leave, but her answer bugs him.    He turns back. LASER How can you not even be curious? 
JONI Sorry, Laser. I just don't want to, okay? I'm leaving soon and I don't want to deal with that right now. (co-dependent leak) And also, that could really hurt moms' feelings... 
LASER God, why do you worry about them so much? They don't even have to know about it! 
JONI Look, you can do it when you turn 18, okay? LASER I never ask you for anything. 
Laser walks out of the room.   Joni feels horrible. 
INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT 
Nic and Jules lay in bed watching TV, unwinding from the day. NIC I just don't understand why you bought the truck now. 
JULES Because if I'm starting this business I need something to haul my equipment in. 
NIC Jesus Christ! Nic flops back, traumatized. 
NIC (CONT'D) The whole neighborhood heard that! JULES No, they didn't. 
NIC Well, that was a vibe kill. 
Jules looks defeated. 
INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
Joni turns back to the file on the desk. She flips though some pages of documents and stops. CLOSE ON a PHOTO of a 4 YEAR-OLD BOY standing in a sandbox looking straight into a camera with a big, open grin. 
MATCH CUT TO: 
EXT. FARM - DAY 
We see that boy, 35 years later, carrying a box of tomatoes and putting them in the back of a truck. This is PAUL, Joni and Laser's biological father. 
INT. PAUL'S RESTAURANT - "WYSIWYG"    - DAY Paul walks in carrying the box of tomatoes. He approaches TANYA, (30's) the restaurant's super sexy hostess. PAUL How you doing, foxy? 
TANYA Mm, flapjack, you're smelling ripe. 
PAUL Oh, sorry... TANYA No, I like it. It's earthy. 
PAUL What can I say. I've just been out there, you know...hoe-ing. (looking at the seating chart) How's it looking tonight? They stand close to each other, peering at the chart. 
TANYA Gonna be tight. PAUL Really... 
Paul's cell rings. He gives Tanya a hand squeeze and heads for the kitchen, answering. PAUL (CONT'D) Hello. 
WOMAN'S VOICE Hi, is this Paul Hatfield? 
PAUL It is.   Who's this? 
WOMAN'S VOICE My name is Wendy Minter. I'm calling from The Pacific Cryobank. PAUL Okay.   What can I do for you? 
WENDY I just need to confirm that you donated sperm with us between 1991 and 1993. At the mention of the word sperm, Paul goes pale. 
PAUL Yeah...I did a little bit of that back then... 
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Paul enters. The kitchen is humming with COOKS prepping for the dinner rush. He looks around for a quiet spot. 
WENDY As you know the Cryobank has a confidentiality policy which prohibits us from releasing your identity without your consent. 
A cook, MARGO, approaches Paul to speak with him.   Paul nods: "Can't talk." Hands her the box of tomatoes. 
PAUL Uh-huh. Paul heads to the back of the kitchen, searching for privacy. 
INT. PANTRY - SAME Paul moves into the pantry, finds the farthest corner. 
WENDY (O.S.) Well we've been contacted by a young woman conceived using your semen, and she's asked if you'd be open to having contact with her. 
JONI Yeah. Well, technically my half- brother. Each of my moms had a kid, you know, with your sperm... PAUL No.   I didn't know. 
JONI Oh. PAUL Both of them? 
JONI Yeah. 
PAUL Like in two? JONI Uh huh.   Like in gay. 
PAUL Good deal.     I love lesbians. Paul cringes at his lameness.     Joni doesn't know what to say. 
OMITTED. 
EXT. "WYSIWYG", PARKING LOT - NEXT DAY 
Joni and Laser get out of the car and head to the restaurant to meet Paul. They're both clearly nervous. 
JONI I just don't want you to have big expectations. 
LASER Will you quit saying that?    I don't have any expectations. JONI Okay. I'm just saying he might be weird. I mean, he donated sperm... LASER Well if he hadn't done it, you wouldn't be here. So respect, yo! 
INT. "WYSIWYG" - DAY Paul sits alone at a table facing the entrance.   He nervously checks the door as customers enter. 
MINUTES LATER- Joni and Laser enter the restaurant.   They look nervous too. 
ANGLE ON PAUL 
He studies them for a beat, sees them looking around. Figures they must be "his kids." They look in his direction, spot him. He raises his hand, stands. They walk over. 
The moment is rife.    Paul holds out his hand to Joni. PAUL Joni.    Hey. Nice to meet you. 
JONI Nice to meet you too. Paul holds out a hand to Laser. 
PAUL And Laser, right? LASER Right. 
PAUL Very cool name. 
LASER Thanks. 
PAUL Thanks for making the trek all the way over here. No one knows what comes next. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Cool, I got a table set up for us out here... 
Paul turns and leads them out to the outdoor dining area. 
EXT. OUTDOOR DINING AREA - MINUTES LATER 
They all sit eating.    Paul can't help but study their faces. PAUL Listen, feel free and ask me anything you want, okay? (off their stares) Or we can just hang out. That's fine too. Whatever you guys want. 
LASER/JONI Okay. Paul presses on, trying to break the ice. 
PAUL Anything you want to ask me, Laser? LASER I...uh...I didn't really have any specific questions... PAUL (helping him out) That's fine. I'd love to know about you guys. What about you, Joni? What are you up to? JONI Uh, well, I just graduated high school. I'm starting college in the fall. PAUL Oh yeah?     Congratulations. 
JONI Yeah...totally...thank you. 
Now Paul and Laser share a somewhat awkward man-hug. 
PAUL Really nice to meet you, Laser. 
LASER Yeah. 
Joni gives a quick wave to Paul. She turns to go and Laser follows. Paul watches them walk away. He looks stirred up by the meeting. 
INT. JONI'S CAR - DAY 
Joni and Laser head back home. 
JONI I just never pictured him that way. I just...I don't know...He was so cool and interesting. I can't believe that was him...He was so nice, you know?... LASER I guess... 
JONI You guess? 
LASER Yeah... JONI God, Laser! You're the one that wanted to meet him so bad! 
LASER I know. 
JONI Well what did you think of him? LASER I don't know. He seemed kind of into himself. 
OMITTED 
INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - TV ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Nic and Jules are cuddled up affectionately on the couch watching cable. They see Laser on his way out of the house. 
JULES Hey bug, come here. We're watching "Locked Up Abroad: Uganda." LASER I saw it.    It was gnarly. NIC Where are you going? 
LASER Clay's. 
Jules and Nic shoot each other a concerned look. 
NIC Don't be back late, okay? 
LASER I know. JULES Can I have a hug before you go? 
LASER Mom... JULES Just a quick one.   Please! 
LASER Hug her.    That's what she's there for. 
Laser leaves.   Nic hits mute on the TV, looks at Jules. NIC Ugh. Maybe we should just sit him down and ask him already. 
JULES What?    "Are you and Clay fucking?" 
NIC "Exploring" is the word I'd use... 
JULES And what if he is "exploring?" This is the age for that. Why should we care? 
CLAY (CONT'D) Whoa! 
Clay turns on the dildo.      It starts to gyrate. 
CLAY (CONT'D) Yo, it's alive! 
LASER Dude, put it back!! Laughing, Clay throws the dildo back in the drawer.    Then he grabs one of the DVDs and spins back around. 
CLAY Dude, we're watching this. 
INT. LASER'S ROOM - DAY 
Laser and Clay sit on the bed.     They look at each other. Then Laser hits play. 
ON SCREEN 
We see a COP giving a young MAN a BLOW-JOB. Laser and Clay sit motionless, shocked, disgusted, riveted. 
CLAY Think the whole thing's like this? 
LASER Want me to fast-forward? 
Clay doesn't answer.    They just keep watching. 
OMITTED 
OMITTED 
EXT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY Jules pulls her truck into the driveway, almost running over Laser's bike. 
INT. LASER'S ROOM - DAY 
Laser and Clay are still watching the porn...as Jules walks in the room. JULES Laser, you left your bike out... 
Laser reflexively grabs for the remote. As he fumbles for it, Jules sees what they're watching. She looks mortified. 
INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT EVENING 
We enter a family conference already in progress. Nic and Jules act calm but are inwardly mortified that their 15-year-old son found their porn. 
NIC Laser, your mom and I accept you and love you unconditionally? You know that, right? 
LASER Yeah. 
NIC And you know you can be open with us about anything. 
LASER Yeah, I know. 
Jules steels herself for a frank discussion. 
JULES Laser, is there anything you want to talk about? LASER Like what? NIC Anything.     Anything on your mind. 
NIC But why didn't you tell us? 
JONI Because we knew you'd be upset. 
NIC WE'RE NOT UPSET!! 
Jules calms her riled-up partner. JULES Honey... (to Joni; expressing her upset more calmly) We just wish you'd have included us in your thinking. But what's done is done. You met him, and now you guys can move on-- 
JONI (sheepish) Actually... (beat) I want to see him again. JULES                             LASER You do?!                         You do?! 
JONI (CONT'D) (to Laser) Yeah. I was gonna tell you. 
NIC Whoa! Whoa! No. No way. (regaining dominance) Nobody is seeing anyone until we meet him! 
Joni looks at Laser.   They knew this would happen. 
INT. NIC AND JULES' BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Nic and Jules do a post-mortem as they floss. 
NIC Yeah, I get it. He's their biological father and all that crap but it still feels really shitty. Like we're not enough or something, you know? 
JULES Of course I know. I don't want to time-share our kids with someone. Especially when it's Joni's last summer home. No way. 
When Jules leaves the room Nic pulls a clump of long, wet red hair out of the sink. NIC Jesus, Jules! The plumber was just here! 
Nic throws the clump of hair in the trash. 
INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
NIC (getting tactical) Look, we need to be smart about this. If we act like grubby bitches, we're just gonna make it worse. JULES I know... 
NIC Let's just kill him with kindness and put it to bed. 
JULES I'm with you, honey. (then) We're gonna get through this, okay? 
Nic smiles.   She loves when Jules shows confidence. NIC I love you, chicken. 
The women bump fists.   They have a plan. JULES I love you too, pony. 
EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON 
Paul rides slowly down the street, checking addresses. He pulls over and cuts his engine in front of the Allgood house. 
OMITTED 
INT/EXT. ALLGOOD FRONT DOOR - AFTERNOON 
Paul rings the bell. Waits. The door opens and Nic and Jules are there smiling with "kill him with kindness" faces. 
NIC Paul! It is so great to meet you. I'm Nic. This is Jules. 
They both laugh.    Nic's funny sometimes. 
EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - ECHO PARK - DAY 
Jules drives slowly up the hill looking for Paul's address. She sees the house and pulls in the driveway next to an old truck and a motorcycle. 
EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY 
Jules and Paul walk through Paul's backyard, evaluating. JULES ...We could do a kind of a Secret Garden thing with trellises and topiary... (clocking his face) ...or something more Asian, minimal, with a rock garden feel. It's up to you... PAUL What do you think? 
JULES Personally, I'm tired of minimal. I'm into more is more. Let's not try to tame the space. I think it would look great all lush and overgrown and fecund... PAUL Fecund? 
JULES I'm sorry, you know, fertile... 
PAUL No, I love that word. You just don't hear it that often. (thinking) More is more. Yeah. Let's do that. 
Jules is staring at Paul. 
PAUL (CONT'D) What? 
JULES Sorry, I just keep seeing my kids in your expressions... 
Jules looks more intensely at Paul's face. JULES (CONT'D) You and Laser have the same mouth. 
PAUL You think so? 
JULES Yeah. The observation strikes Paul. Suddenly, he's feeling a kind of fast-tracked intimacy with Jules he hadn't expected. 
EXT. BACKYARD - ALLGOOD HOUSE - EVENING Jules and Laser play Ping-Pong as Nic gets home with Chinese take-out for the family dinner. 
NIC What's the score? 
JULES Pretty close. Laser cranks a forehand that whizzes past Jules. 
LASER 20-3...match point. NIC So how'd it go today? 
JULES Great.   We settled on a concept. 
NIC What is it? 
JULES It's hard to explain. You have to kind of see the space to get it. 
NIC (to Laser) Laser, did you write Pup-pup a Get Well card? (off his silence) Laser! What do I have to do?! I bought you a card. I left it on your desk. All you had to do was-- LASER Mom, settle! I will... 
NIC Don't tell me to settle, mister. And if it's not in the mail by tomorrow morning, we're not going to the Dodger game Saturday. 
LASER Whatever, I have other plans anyway. 
NIC What other plans? (off his silence) I'm asking you a quest-- 
LASER I said I'd do something with Paul! Laser serves a rocket, whizzing past a flailing Jules. He tosses the racquet on the table and leaves. Nic yells: 
Laser doesn't quite buy Paul's altruism.    He looks over at him, then away. 
INT. JONI'S ROOM - DAY 
Jai and Joni and Sasha play Scrabble.    Sasha checks out the photos of Paul on Joni's phone. 
SASHA Hello? Donor Dad? Stone cold fox. JAI Must you take everything beautiful and make it dirty? 
SASHA I'm just saying. Spermster's a hottie. Is he single? 
JONI Okay, first of all, ewww. Second, he's a really good person and I'd prefer it if you didn't taint him with your whore juice. 
Sasha hops up, energized by the banter. 
SASHA Fair enough, hairy muff. I'm outta here. You love birds can split my letters... 
Sasha splits and suddenly the room is thick with nervous tension. 
JONI You want to keep playing? 
JAI Sure. 
As Jai incorporates Sasha's tiles into his own, we see Joni gathering her nerve to make a move. Jai probably feels it but in his nervousness he can't look at Joni. 
JAI (CONT'D) Sometimes I feel sorry for Sasha, you know... JONI Yeah... 
Joni starts to move in, her face draws closer to Jai's, inch by inch. 
Somehow, deep down, Jai can sense her moving towards him which exhilarates and freaks the shit out of him at the same time. To the point where he lets slip... JAI It's like she has to sexualize every experience, you know? It's just sad... That stops Joni in her tracks. 
JONI Yeah, it is. It's really sad. Jai's sabotaged the mood and they both know it. 
INT. NIC AND JULES' BATHROOM - NIGHT Jules walks in to find Nic in sexy satin man-PJ's, sitting at the rim of a RUNNING BATH. There are candles burning. 
JULES Wow.    What's this? 
NIC Come here.     Sit down. 
Jules takes a seat beside her.       Nic holds her hand. 
NIC (CONT'D) I'm sorry I've been such a bitch lately. I know I'm not being my highest self. 
JULES Yeah, well... 
NIC You've been really patient with me. I just want you to know that hasn't gone unrecognized. 
Nic gives her a long, sweet kiss.      Jules is warming up. 
NIC (CONT'D) Get in. 
CUT TO - JULES 
JULES No, please, just take it away... PAUL You had one bite. 
JULES I have another you may as well just tape it to my ass cause that's where it'll end up. 
PAUL Hey now, don't go negative on your ass. 
Jules blushes at all this talk of her ass. JULES So...you're good with the plants? (off his silence) Look, we don't have to do that. We could do go in a totally different direction if you-- 
PAUL No, I'm just thinking. Hang on. (covers his eyes) Yeah, I'm good with the plants. 
JULES Sorry. Sometimes I mistake silence for criticism. 
PAUL I wasn't criticizing you. 
JULES No, I know...I just... (beat) Sometimes Nic can be a little critical, you know. She's a perfectionist. 
PAUL That doesn't mean you have to be negative. 
Jules looks away.    We HEAR a knock from the back. LUIS (O.S.) Excuse me, Senora? Hello? 
Jules turns, sees Luis standing at the glass door. JULES What's up? 
LUIS 5 o'clock. JULES Yeah.     Okay. 
Jules wants Luis to leave her alone.    But he's not going. LUIS Same time tomorrow? 
JULES Yes!    Same time! 
Luis leaves.   Jules turns back to Paul, laughs nervously. 
JULES (CONT'D) Okay.     I'm gonna take off too... 
PAUL (in Luis's accent) Same time tomorrow? Jules pushes Paul, laughing. 
JULES That's mean. 
Paul hands her a Tupperware with some of the pie in it. 
PAUL Here, take this... 
JULES No! 
PAUL Just give it to the kids. JULES Okay!   God, you're such a pusher! Jules grabs the pie and gives him a kiss on the mouth, almost as a mistake. Before they know it, they're making out. 
Jules snaps back, freaked. JULES (CONT'D) Whoa. I'm sorry. That was...I don't know where that came from... PAUL (freaked himself) It's okay... 
JULES Okay.   I'm gonna go now... 
Jules starts backing away, acting as if nothing happened. 
PAUL Jules...? 
LASER Hey buddy.     Good boy. 
Laser sees the dog has no tags. He looks around for an owner. The dog nuzzles Laser for affection. 
LASER (CONT'D) I've seen this dog around.        I wonder if he's lost. 
CLAY Let's pee on his head. 
LASER What? Clay unzips his fly.     It's difficult with the plaster cast. 
LASER (CONT'D) Dude, don't do that. CLAY Come on.     Hold him... 
Clay yanks the dog by his scruff. LASER Dude, Quit it! 
CLAY (mocking) Duuude, quit it! 
Suddenly, Laser gets it. His friend is the tool.     He grabs the dog and smacks him to get him to run away. LASER Go!   Run!    Get out of here! 
The dog TAKES OFF.     Clay shoves Laser. CLAY Why are you such a fag?! 
Laser shoves Clay back hard. LASER Why are you such a dick?! 
Clay HITS Laser in the mouth. Laser touches his lip.     Sees blood, and walks away. Friendship over. 
EXT. URBAN FARM PARKING LOT - ECHO PARK - MAGIC HOUR 
Paul and Joni walk to his motorcycle parked in the dirt lot behind them. Paul grabs his helmet off the bike, hands it to Joni. 
PAUL Here, put this on. Joni takes the helmet and puts it on. Paul fastens the buckle for her. They get on the bike and take off down the hill. 
EXT. ECHO PARK TO THE WEST SIDE - MAGIC HOUR Paul takes Joni home on his motorcycle via Sunset Boulevard. She holds Paul tightly. 
INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING The ladies sit in the living room watching TV. 
JULES Relax. She'll get home when she gets home. 
NIC Quit telling me to relax! They go back to watching TV.   After a beat, we HEAR a motorcycle pull up. 
NIC (CONT'D) What the fuck...! 
EXT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Paul and Joni climb off the bike. Nic storms out of the house to intercept them by the sidewalk. 
NIC Funny how someone conveniently forgot to tell me they were driving home on a motorcycle! 
JONI Mom... 
NIC You know how many people I've seen come into the hospital paralyzed from motorcycle accidents?! 
PAUL I'm a very safe rider... 
They stare at each other.      It's like watching two magnets. PAUL The air is clear. 
Jules grabs Paul and starts smothering him with kisses. It takes a second for Paul to get his bearings, but when he does, he starts kissing her back with equal fervor, pushing her up against the wall, wedging his hand between her legs. JULES Paul, I can't! 
PAUL You don't want to?! 
JULES No, I do! It's just... (urgent whisper) I have a guy outside! 
Overcome with lust, Jules wraps her legs around his waist and Paul walks her into... 
HIS BEDROOM 
Quick cuts of their awkward ravenous gropings. Somewhere between slapstick and animal. He pulls her hair back hard. She loves it. She pulls his hair back harder. He yelps. She pulls down his underwear. Her eyes widen. It's been decades since she's seen a hard cock in the flesh. 
JULES Oh.   Well.     Hel-lo! 
Cut to them fucking. It's gawky and passionate.    Somewhere in the middle of it, Jules starts laughing. PAUL What? 
JULES Nothing. Paul flips her on her hands and knees and they go at it some more. 
She keeps laughing. Paul goes harder to make her stop. The paces grows quicker. They're getting closer. And then... 
LUIS (O.S.) Hello?   Excuse me, Senora Allgood?! They stop mid-thrust. 
JULES You gotta be fucking kidding me! She dislodges from Paul and starts dressing furiously. 
INT./EXT.   PAUL'S HOUSE - DAY Jules runs out to meet Luis, waiting patiently at the door. 
JULES What's up? 
LUIS Where do you want the stones? 
JULES (catching her breath) The stones? Over by the fence. 
Luis stares at his employer. She looks totally disheveled. Jules starts feeling her hair, smoothing it into shape. 
JULES (CONT'D) (defensive) What? I was using the bathroom. (then) Do you need to use the bathroom? 
Luis stares at her feet.       She looks down.   She's barefoot. 
EXT. PUBLIC PARK - DAY 
Paul and Laser shoot hoop. There's a tense-ness to their patter. Laser takes the ball and steps to the top of the key and shoots. Drains it. 
LASER That's H. PAUL I know. 
Laser steps up to left side of the basket, calls his shot. LASER Lay-up. 
PAUL Hey, don't take it easy on me cause you're winning-- 
Laser does a trick behind the back lay-up.        Nails it.   Then tosses the ball to Paul. PAUL (CONT'D) Nobody likes a show-off. 
Nic tightens at the mention of Paul. 
JOEL So, the kids have been spending time with him? 
NIC Oh, yeah, they're spending all kinds of quality time together. 
STELLA (senses the sarcasm) Well, it's great they like him so much.   You know, you hear these stories about kids meeting their donors and the guys end up being nothing like they were on paper. NIC No, everyone's getting along famously. Apparently Paul can do no wrong... Nic grabs a passing waiter by the arm. 
NIC (CONT'D) Can we get another bottle of the Seavey Cabernet? Jules gives Nic a look.   Joel and Stella feel the tension between them. 
STELLA Hey, have you guys tried those Açai fruit packs? 
JULES No, but they're pushing them like crack at Whole Foods. 
STELLA I know.    Joel's addicted. 
JOEL What I do is I throw one in the blender with some bananas, frozen strawberries and hemp milk and I'll tell you, it's sensational. 
Nic slaps her forehead. NIC Oh, just fucking kill me... 
Everyone stiffens.   Jules is embarrassed. JULES Honey... 
NIC I'm sorry guys, but I just can't, with the fucking hemp milk and the organic farming and heirloom tomatoes. (mocking-voice) "Oh no, don't throw that in the trash, no man, you gotta throw that into the composting bin so the fucking worms can shit all over it and turn it into glorious multch and we can all feel better about ourselves." God! What a bunch of bullshit! 
Nic takes a big swallow from her glass.   Jules windshield wipes Nic's forearm. 
JULES (sotto) How about some green tea, honey... Nic slams her glass on the table.   Explodes. 
NIC You know what, Jules?! I like my wine! Okay? So fucking sue me! And fyi, red wine has a chemical called Resveratrol in it, which has been proven to significantly extend human lifespan! 
JULES Yeah, if you drink a thousand bottles a day! 
NIC Fuck you. Nic storms off.   Jules turns to Joel and Stella, ashen. 
JULES I'm sorry. 
INT. RESTAURANT BAR - MINUTES LATER 
Jules walks over to the bar. Nic is sitting in the corner. JULES What the hell is going on with you? 
NIC This whole Paul thing is driving me crazy! I feel like he's taking over my family. 
Jules tries to bring it down.   She yells in hushed tones. JULES No. He's not! 
NIC (nerves fraying) Okay! Okay. I'm sorry.      I'm just exhausted... 
JULES Maybe you need to take some time off and recharge. 
NIC (self-pitying) Sure, and who's gonna pay for that? Jules looks pissed off, and hurt. 
NIC (CONT'D) Look, I'm sorry, I just feel like I'm carrying the whole load here. 
Paul grabs Jules' wrist and mouths "wait!"   Jules rips her arm free and walks out. 
MOMENTS LATER - JULES 
walks outside and is stunned to find Luis already back from Home Depot, sneezing and wiping his nose. 
JULES Did you go to Home Depot? LUIS Yeah.   I just got back. 
JULES That was fast! 
LUIS Yeah, no lines. 
His look of confusion trips off her paranoia.      She's convinced he knows everything. 
JULES What's that look? LUIS What look? JULES The look you're giving me right now! LUIS That's no look.     That just my face. 
JULES Look, I'm not gonna play this game with you! You need to keep your judgements to yourself! 
LUIS Senora, I didn't give no looks! JULES I don't ask you why you keep blowing your nose constantly! I mean, if you have a drug problem that's your business... 
LUIS I don't have no drug problem! I have the allergies! JULES Then why are you a gardener?! 
Luis stares at Jules, innocent. LUIS Cause I love the flowers. 
JULES Look, this isn't gonna work. I'll pay you through the end of the day and then we're done. 
Jules walks past a totally confused Luis. 
INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Jules lies on her side. Nic shuffles to get to close to her. Jules moves away, still pissed at her. Nic realizes she needs to make amends. 
INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING The family sits in silence, having breakfast.     Nic looks around the table, feeling like a pariah. NIC Look, I know you've all been enjoying your time with Paul. And I know I haven't been as open to him as everyone else and this has caused some...friction...between us. But I'd like to try and change that... Everyone keeps eating, uncommitted.   "And...?" 
NIC (CONT'D) So I was thinking. Maybe it would be nice if we all had dinner at his house sometime. That way, I could get to know him a little better, and I could see all the good work mom's been doing with his backyard. Nic looks at Jules and smiles. Everyone nods.     They recognize this is a big step for Nic. 
OMITTED 
EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY 
Paul walks out to check on Jules. She's sweating her ass off, shlepping stacks of heavy mulch across the yard. 
PAUL How's it going? JULES Okay... 
PAUL Here, let me help. 
Paul takes some of her load and together they transport the sod to the other side of the yard. Neither know what to say. 
Paul stares at her, waiting for her lead. 
JULES We can't be doing this... 
Tanya's face drops. 
TANYA What happened? 
PAUL You know, our thing is really fun and easy, but...I don't want to be 50 and still "hanging out." You know? If I really want a family then I have to stop getting in these situations that don't go anywhere. Paul just looks at her.   Tanya gets it. 
TANYA (welling up) Oh. 
Paul knows enough to say nothing.      Tanya gets up and walks off. TANYA (CONT'D) Fuck you. 
Paul sits there, feeling like an asshole. 
EXT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR 
The family packs into the Volvo to head to Paul's. 
INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MAGIC HOUR 
Paul gets dinner ready with Joni and Laser as his sous-chefs. Both kids seem really jazzed to be cooking with him. 
IN THE BACKYARD -EVENING 
Jules tours Nic around the backyard, looking a little freaked out as she shows her the work she's been doing. 
JULES I'm gonna do some planting over there so it won't look so bare... 
NIC It looks great, honey. Very indigenous. I'm so proud of you. 
Nic kisses Jules spontaneously. Jules looks nauseous again. They head back up the stairs, toward Paul's house. NIC (CONT'D) Hey, so how's that guy Luis working out? 
JULES Oh, I had to fire him. 
NIC (surprised) Really?! JULES Yeah, he had a drug problem. 
NIC Whoa.   What kind of drugs? 
JULES Blow, I think... 
INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER 
Nic flips through Paul's album collection, including Joni Mitchell's Blue. 
INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
Everyone digs into the meal, enjoying themselves.   Especially Nic, who's committed to redeeming herself. 
PAUL Hey Nic, I think you're gonna love this `98 Screaming Eagle. NIC You know what, I think I'm gonna stick with water tonight. But thank you so much. The Allgoods look at Nic: this is a first. 
NIC (CONT'D) God, Paul, this steak is delicious. What's the seasoning? 
PAUL I just mist it with a little truffle oil. 
PAUL Hey. It's hard enough to open your heart in this world. Don't make it harder. LASER You're right. (to Nic; contrite) I'm sorry, mom. Nic looks at Paul.    Stunned.   Then looks at Jules and points to Paul. 
NIC I like this guy. 
Paul looks at Joni. 
PAUL You didn't tell me you were named after Joni M. 
JONI It's just so dorky. I don't really like to bring it up. 
PAUL I think it's cool. NIC (getting up) Hey Paul. Where's your bathroom? 
PAUL Just around there. 
On her way to the loo, Nic turns back to Paul. 
NIC You know what? I think I will try some of that Screaming Eagle. 
INT. PAUL'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Nic washes her hands at the sink. Something catches her eye. She lifts Paul's hairbrush from the shelf in front of her and examines it. She reaches into the bristles and pulls out... 
A few strands of long red hair. 
Nic pales. 
CUT TO Nic on her knees in Paul's shower, pulling a clump of tell- tale red hair from the drain. 
CUT TO Nic skulks out of the bathroom.   She looks out and b-lines for the bedroom. 
CUT TO Nic pulling pillows off Paul's bed.   Her look tells us she's found hair here as well. 
THEN WE CUT TO Nic sitting back down at the table. She looks drained. Nobody notices. The sound drops out. 
NIC'S POV: Paul and Jules talking comfortably. 
Joni and Laser chiming in, smiling, one big happy family. REVERSE ONTO NIC: 
Totally disconnected. Shell-shocked. She wants to scream but it feels like she's trapped in cement. Things slow way down... 
OMITTED 
INT. NIC AND JULES' BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT Nic and Jules perform their nightly ablutions.   Jules is sonic-caring her teeth. 
JULES (through the sonic buzz) Well, you and Paul seemed to get on like gang-busters... 
NIC You're sleeping with him, aren't you. JULES (freaked) What? 
Nic turns to her, eyes red with anger. 
NIC Just be honest with me. Don't make me feel crazier than I feel right now! 
JONI You're excused. (then back to Jai) Hey, can I talk to you? 
Joni leads Jai to a private corner. 
She leans in and kisses Jai. And Jai actually returns the kiss. And it's completely sweet and intimate. 
But then the kiss starts to morph as Joni's energy turns manic, intense, less romantic than emotionally needy. We see Jai start to pull away. But Joni keeps holding him, wanting more. Finally, Jai breaks off the kiss. 
JAI Joni...Joni... 
JONI What? 
Joni looks pained, embarrassed.      Jai keeps holding her hands. JAI Are you okay? 
JONI Yeah, I'm fine... Joni pulls free and escapes, leaving a confused Jai in her wake. 
INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Jules walks in to find Nic, awake, in bed. 
JULES Just getting another pillow.   The couch is kind of saggy. 
NIC Is your back okay? Jules perks up: is this an invitation to share the bed again? 
JULES It's a little ache-y. NIC You should take some Advil. 
Guess not. Suddenly they hear bumping and loud footsteps downstairs. 
INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Jules walks downstairs to find Joni stumbling toward her bedroom. 
JULES Hey.    How was the party? 
Joni tries to avert her mom's questioning gaze. 
JONI Fine. 
JULES How big was it? JONI I don't know. Medium...ish... 
Jules takes in the glassy look in her daughter's eyes. JULES Are you drunk? 
JONI No. Nic enters from the stairs, having caught the last piece. 
NIC I hope you had a designated driver. JONI Why?    I'm not drunk. 
NIC Well, you seem drunk to me. 
JONI Yeah, well, you should know. NIC (furious; incredulous) What did you just say to me?! 
JONI I'm going to bed. 
JONI I don't know... Joni looks down welling up. 
JONI (CONT'D) I just wish you could've been... PAUL What? 
Joni chokes back tears. JONI Better... 
Paul and Joni look up at each other when the door suddenly flings open. Nic is there, fuming. 
NIC You've got some balls, mister! 
PAUL Nic, hold on... 
Nic walks toward he and Joni.   Joni ducks back inside. 
NIC No, you hold on! Let me tell you something, you really hurt my kids! PAUL Well, they're kinda my... 
NIC (cutting him off) No! They're not. This is not your family. This is my family! You're just a fucking interloper... Jules joins Nic, concerned things are getting out of hand. 
PAUL I didn't mean to hurt anyone... Paul and Jules share a look as Nic deals the coup de grace. 
NIC If you want a family so much, go out and make one of your own! Nic heads back inside and slams the door behind her. 
Paul stand alone, spinning. After a moment he spontaneously looks back into the house. Laser is staring at him through the window. Their eyes lock and Paul give Laser a contrite smile. That's the final straw for Laser. He grabs his plate and walks out of view. 
Reeling, Paul heads for his motorcycle. He gets on the bike, helmet in hand. Turns on the ignition. He picks up the helmet and pauses, shaking in the hell of his own making. Losing it, he hurls the helmet at the motorcycle. 
INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - TV ROOM - THAT NIGHT 
Laser, Joni and Nic watch "Locked Up Abroad" Jules walks in front of them, picks up the remote and turns off the TV. JULES I need to say something. 
Everyone sits up.   Jules acts stoic but she's wrecked. 
JULES (CONT'D) Look, it's no big secret your mom and are in hell right now. Bottom line...marriage is hard...really fucking hard. Just two people, slogging through the shit, year after year, getting older, changing. It's a fucking marathon, okay?! Everyone is silenced by the outpouring.   Jules soldiers on. 
JULES (CONT'D) So sometimes you're together so long, you just stop seeing the other person. You just see weird projections of your own junk. And instead of talking to each other, you go off the rails, and act grubby and make stupid choices. Which is what I did. And I feel sick about it because I love you guys and I love your mom and that's the truth. Sometimes you hurt the ones you love the most. I don't know why. Maybe if I read more Russian novels I would... 
Nic looks down, overwhelmed by it all. JULES (CONT'D) Anyway, I just wanted to say how sorry I am about what I did and that I hope you'll forgive me eventually. (awkward) Thank you. 
And, without further ado, Jules hands the remote back to Laser and departs the field. Everyone's silenced by Jules' rambling apologia, especially Nic. 
OMITTED. 
INT. JONI'S ROOM - MORNING 
Joni wakes up. She looks around her room. There's nothing on the walls. The floor is covered with boxes taped and labeled. It's time to go. 
EXT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY 
Nic and Jules stuff the last of Joni's things in the back of their station wagon. Laser and Joni bring the last of the boxes out of the house. 
INT. VOLVO STATION WAGON - DAY The Allgoods are on the road, heading to college.

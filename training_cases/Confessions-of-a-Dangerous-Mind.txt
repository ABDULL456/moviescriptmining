This film is a reenactment of actual events. It is based on Mr. Barris's private journals, public records, and hundreds of hours of taped interviews. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. NYC STREET - NIGHT 
SUBTITLE: NEW YORK CITY, FALL 1981 
It's raining.    A cab speeds down a dark, bumpy side-street. 
INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS 
Looking in his rearview mirror, the cab driver checks out his passenger: a sweaty young man in a gold blazer with a "P" insignia over his breast pocket. Several paper bags on the back seat hedge him in. The young man is immersed in the scrawled list he clutches in his hand. A passing street light momentarily illuminates the list and we glimpse a few of the entries: double-coated waterproof fuse (500 feet); .38 ammo (hollowpoint configuration); potato chips (Lays). 
GONG SHOW 
An excerpt from The Gong Show (reenacted). The video image fills the screen. We watch a fat man recite Hamlet, punctuating his soliloquy with loud belching noises. The audience is booing. Eventually the man gets gonged. Chuck Barris, age 50, hat pulled over his eyes, dances out from the wings to comfort the agitated performer. 
PERFORMER Why'd they do that? I wasn't done. 
BARRIS (AGE 50) I don't understand. Juice, why'd you gong this nice man? 
JAYE P. MORGAN Not to be.     That is the answer. 
The studio audience laughs. 
INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT 
The cab sloshes to a stop in front of a liquor store. The young man gets out, jogs through the rain toward the fluorescent storefront. The cab driver waits, listens to staticky reports in a foreign language on his radio. The meter is running. The back seat is piled high with bags. 
GONG SHOW 
Chuck Barris spastically dances on the screen along with Gene Gene the Dancing Machine. Barris turns to the camera, points at it. 
BARRIS We'll be right back with more stuff. 
INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT 
The back of the cab is filled with even more bags and boxes. The cab stops. The young man gets out and confers with a shady looking guy on the corner. The young man pulls out a big wad of cash. Money and a small package change hands. The meter in the cab is at thirty-five dollars and change. 
THE GONG SHOW 
Chuck Barris is being sniffed in the crotch by a large dog. The audience howls with glee. Suddenly the video image explodes. Slow motion sparks and shards of glass shoot toward the camera. We pull back to reveal we're in a darkened, messy hotel room. We pan across the walls, past taped-up, yellowed newspaper clippings with headlines like "Gong Show a New Low in Television", "The Dumbing of America", and "Chuck Barris is the Decline of Western Civilization." We come to rest on a naked middle-aged man crouching in the shadows in the corner, holding a gun. This is Chuck Barris. The television continues to sputter, spark, and smoke. There is a knock at the door. 
BARRIS (mumbly) Fuck. Shit. Piss. 
Naked Barris, still holding the gun, seems panicked. He hesitates, trying to determine his options. Should he answer the door? Should he climb out onto the window ledge? Finally, he creeps to the door and peeks out the peephole for a long moment. He unlocks the door, opens it. The sweaty, young man, a bellhop, stands there with his many bags. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
He tries to appear casual as takes in the sight: a naked Chuck Barris holding a gun, an exploded, smoking tv set in the background. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) (weakly) More stuff? 
BELLHOP Yes sir, Mr. Barris. Everything you requested. Except I couldn't find a... (consults list) ... DH-10 directional fragmentation mine. 
BARRIS Well, it's late. (mumbling and bowing) But thank you. Thank you for trying. You are a scholar and a... 
Barris trails off, gives a quick glance both ways down the hall, then motions for the bellhop to enter. The bellhop places the bags on a table, fishes in his pocket and pulls out some bills. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) Keep it. It's okay. Keep it.    You are a scholar and a... 
Barris trails off. 
BELLHOP (eyes averted) Thank you, sir. 
Suddenly Barris becomes agitated. 
BARRIS Why are you not looking at me like that? Do I look ugly to you? (runs to the mirror) It's the not sleeping. I'm not sleeping, see. I have a lot on my... 
Barris trails off. There is a pause.   The bellhop attempts to make conversation. 
BELLHOP (re: exploded tv) Um, another Gong Show rerun, sir? 
Young Barris rolling on the ground in battle with another boy, as a crowd of children look on. 
BARRIS (V.O.) A constant, inarticulate rage leading to fist fight after fist fight. 
INT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - MORNING 
Young Barris watches dust motes lit by the early morning sunlight pouring through his bedroom window. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BARRIS (V.O.) The calm I felt watching dust suspended in the early morning sunlight. 
INT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Young Barris sits on the floor and watches the shadow of a man walking upstairs. The young boy is clearly terrified. 
BARRIS (V.O.) I remember fear. 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING 
Toddler Barris watches his mother change clothes. He studies her pendulous breasts. She looks down, smiles warmly. 
BARRIS (V.O.) Love. 
MOTHER You like the way mommy looks, Chuckie? 
BARRIS (AGE 4) Yes. 
MOTHER I bet you would like to be a mommy some day, wouldn't you? 
BARRIS Yes, mommy. Please. 
MOTHER C'mere, you. 
His mother lifts the little boy to her breasts and presses his face against them. He is in heaven. 
INT. CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY 
Four year old Chuck sits at the dining room table with several other four year olds. They all wear party hats. Barris's father, a milquetoast middle-aged man enters in birthday hat, carrying a cake decorated with four lit candles. He leads the children in "Happy Birthday Dear Chuck" as young Chuck beams. 
BARRIS (V.O.) Rejection. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Chuck glances at the kitchen doorway. His mother stands there, staring at him. She dressed in black mourning clothes, complete with veil. 
INT. NURSERY - DAY 
Young Chuck peeks in as his mother sits in a rocking chair and holds Barris's infant sister. She fusses with the bows and frills on the baby's outfit. The light in the room is golden and warm. 
BARRIS (V.O.) Expulsion. 
We move in on the little boy's devastated face, then follow him as he turns and walks down the hall into darkness. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
A sixteen year old Barris lies on his back on a couch lazily tossing a football in the air. Tuvia, a thirteen year old girl, sits on the floor playing with a puppy. In the background, throughout the scene, we hear the inept playing of scales on a bass violin. 
BARRIS (V.O.) When I was sixteen I had an experience with my little sister's friend Tuvia that left an indelible impression. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) Phoebe's no Walter Page, huh, Tuvia? 
TUVIA I don't know who that is. 
BARRIS Of course you don't. (beat) Why are you waiting around anyway, listening to this cacophonous cacophony, when you could be in your own abode disrupting the lives of your own siblings? 
TUVIA I don't know what anything you say means. 
BARRIS No.    You wouldn't, would you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Barris watches Tuvia playing with the dog. She gets on all fours and yelps, imitating the dog. This excites the dog, who bounces around her. Barris studies Tuvia's exposed white underwear for a while. This excites Barris. Finally he pulls an afghan off the back of the couch and drapes it over his pants. We hear him unzip his fly. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) Hey. 
TUVIA (not looking) What? 
BARRIS Hey, Tuvia. 
TUVIA (turning) Wha-at?! 
Tuvia sees Barris fiddling with something under the afghan. She gets quiet. 
The tourists "ooooh." Another tour group comes around a corner. This one is led by Georgia, a perky, blonde southern girl. The two groups squeeze past each other. Chuck tries to make eye contact with Georgia. He smiles at her, but she ignores him. 
INT. NBC COMMISSARY - DAY 
Barris is at the cash register paying for his food. He looks around for a place to sit. He spots Georgia, sitting with a female friend, and he sits at a table behind, so as to listen unobserved to their conversation. 
GIRLFRIEND That fella Raymond in payroll is kinda cute, huh? 
GEORGIA Cute's all well and good, Mary Ann, but what you want is a man who's goin' places. A go-getter on the management fast-track. 
Barris registers this information. 
INT. NBC PERSONNEL OFFICE - DAY 
Barris stands at the counter talking to a female clerk. 
BARRIS Management trainee application, please. 
The clerk hands him an application without looking up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BARRIS (CONT'D) How many people applying for this so far? 
CLERK (calculating) Let's see, including you... about two thousand. 
BARRIS For how many positions? 
CLERK (looking up and smiling) Five. 
INT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY 
Barris sitting with a book and copying the names of three of the board of directors of RCA onto his application under the heading of "Personal References." 
INT. BARRIS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Young Barris is having sex with Georgia. They finish. Barris rolls off her and onto his back. Georgia sighs. 
GEORGIA Tell me again. 
BARRIS Head of network sales at thirty.   Head of the entire network at forty. 
GEORGIA And? 
BARRIS (rote) Dead of a heart attack by fifty with all my millions left to you. 
GEORGIA You're wonderful. I love you, Mr. Chuck Barris, management trainee. 
She climbs on top of Barris and begins kissing him all over. 
BARRIS (V.O.) Life was sweet. For a minute. 
INT. BARRIS'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 
Georgia is looking radiant as she reads a movie magazine. Barris enters. She runs over to kiss him. 
GEORGIA Baby doll! 
BARRIS I got fired. 
She pulls away, studies him for a moment, lets it sink in. 
GEORGIA Fired? 
BARRIS Fired.   F-I-R... 
GEORGIA Fired?   What the fuck did you get fired for?! 
BARRIS I don't know, efficiency cutback. Some bullshit... Look, it's gonna be... 
GEORGIA Well, I'm pregnant, you fuck! 
BARRIS Pregnant? 
GEORGIA Yeah, pregnant! 
BARRIS What the fuck did you get pregnant for?! 
GEORGIA What do you mean, what the fuck did I get pregnant for? You got me fucking pregnant, you fuck! 
BARRIS Well, fuck you. 
INT. BAR - NIGHT 
Barris sits drunkenly at the bar.   He talks to a drunken guy next to him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Young Barris watches happily from behind the cameras. He spots, Debbie, a pretty, bland young woman with headphones and a clipboard. He sidles over to her. 
BARRIS Hi. 
DEBBIE What? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BARRIS Hi! 
DEBBIE Oh. 
BARRIS I wrote this song. 
DEBBIE Oh.    Uh-huh. 
BARRIS It's number three on the pop charts. 
Barris pulls out music magazine clipping as proof. 
DEBBIE Huh. 
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Barris and Debbie are having dinner. 
BARRIS See, I believe there's a great future in television. 
DEBBIE Uh-huh. 
BARRIS So I'm going to take my royalties and create a pilot. A pilot is what they call a test tv show. 
DEBBIE I work in tv. 
BARRIS Yeah. It's gonna be a game show. I believe there's a great future in game shows. 
DEBBIE That's good. 
BARRIS Everyone loves game shows, right? 
DEBBIE I don't know. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BARRIS Well, they do. 
DEBBIE That's great then. 
BARRIS I'm on my way! 
There is a long, awkward silence.    They both saw away at their steaks. 
INT. DEBBIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Barris and Debbie are having sex, sort of mechanical. They're plowing through, kind of like sawing through their steaks. When it's over, they both just lie there. 
INT. DEBBIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Young Barris, in his underwear, sits alone in the semi- darkness and stares out the window. The front door unlocks and a woman enters, backlit from the hallway. She turns on the light. This is Penny Pacino, eighteen, a beatnik in a black leotard and skirt and black mascara. She has red hair. She sees Barris on the couch. 
PENNY Hello. 
BARRIS Hi.   Don't be alarmed    I'm with Debbie. 
PENNY Yeah, I figured. 
Penny walks past him, drops her keys and bag on the counter, and enters the kitchenette. Barris watches her ass. 
PENNY (CONT'D) You hungry? 
BARRIS Um, no thanks. 
PENNY Thirsty? 
BARRIS If you have a beer. 
Penny returns with two beers, hands one to Barris.      She sits in a chair across from him. They both drink. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PENNY So how was sex with Debbie?   I've always wondered. 
BARRIS (a little taken aback) It was good. Fine. Thanks for asking. 
PENNY No problem. I just got fucked by this drummer cat. A really righteous Negro hipster. 
EXT. ABC BUILDING - DAY 
Penny leans on a signpost smoking a cigarette. Barris emerges from the building with his cardboard set. He looks grave. He approaches Penny. 
PENNY No? 
BARRIS (lighting up) They bought it! 
Penny screams, hugs Barris. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) They bought it they bought it they bought it... 
The two dance around on the street. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) They're giving me seventy-five hundred fucking dollars to make a pilot! 
PENNY Oh my God!     Oh my God! We gotta go celebrate!     Let's go roller skating! 
Penny kisses Barris. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BARRIS I can't, Pen. I got a date. 
PENNY Okay.     That's cool.    Call me after. 
BARRIS Yeha, okay. I will. 
Barris walks off.       We stay on Penny smoking her cigarette.

BARRIS TENSELY DIRECTING ACTIVITY ON THE SET. 
GIGGLY BACHELORETTE ASKING QUESTION. 
GAWKY BACHELORS MUGGING. 
TOOTHY HOST GUFFAWING. 
ACTUAL BARRIS (V.O.) I figured I was in. All I had to do was get the pilot made and I'd be a millionaire. Everyone would love me. 
MUSIC OUT SUDDENLY. 
EXT. TERRACE - DAY 
ACTUAL BARRIS (staring off) Was anyone ever so young? 
INT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - DAY 
Barris, 32, lies on his bed on his back and tosses the football in the air. A very very very old dog lies on the floor. Phoebe, Barris's 26 year old sister enters. 
PHOEBE Chuck... 
BARRIS Albert's dead. 
PHOEBE Well, he led an amazingly long life. 
BARRIS Still, it's hard to go on. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PHOEBE Y'know, you've been staring out this window for six months now. 
BARRIS I'm trying to come up with new tv shows, if you must know. Okay? That's what I'm doing. I believe there's a real future in tv. (holds up notebook, shakes it) Look. Ideas. Okay? 
PHOEBE You're thirty-two years old, and you have no career and no prospects. 
BARRIS Thanks for the status report, Phoebe. Look, I just gotta come up with the right concept. Then, boom. (holds up notebook again) Which, by the way, I've almost got. 
PHOEBE You're breaking mom's heart.     You know that, don't you? 
Barris looks out the window at his emaciated mother sitting in the yard in an old wicker-backed wheelchair and staring off into space. 
BARRIS Somehow, and don't ask me why, Phoebe, my being born broke mom's heart. 
Barris watches his mother for a long moment. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) Hey Phoebe, you ever see what's-her-name, Tuvia, anymore? 
PHOEBE Who? 
BARRIS Tuvia.   Your friend.   Tuvia.   The girl. 
PHOEBE Oh. No. I heard something. I think she got divorced recently or something. 
Chuck stops chewing. 
BARRIS Jesus. 
BYRD I'm happy to report you fit our profile, Mr. Barris. Are you interested in this work? 
Long pause. 
BARRIS Well, what's the profile? 
BYRD Are you interested in this work, Mr. Barris? 
BARRIS Yeah, sure, I wanna be a secret agent. Contract agent. Whatever. Get to fuck beautiful Eastern European women. Wear a trenchcoat. Sounds like a kick. 
BYRD The work we do is very serious. It's essential in quelling the rise of communism and allowing democracy to gain its rightful foothold around the globe. 
BARRIS Sure.    Yeah. Okay.   That's good. 
EXT. ABANDONED ARMY BASE - DAY 
The place is ramshackle and overgrown.   It looks deserted.    A barbed-wire fence surrounds it. 
INT. BASE REC ROOM - DAY 
A severe-looking instructor is teaching a class to an assembled group of scary-looking men: losers, psychos, mercenaries, Latin American thugs, and Chuck Barris. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
INSTRUCTOR #1 There are several efficient methods of killing a man, were you to find yourself without a weapon. The edge of your hand against the adversary's Adam's apple. (demonstrates on mannequin) This will crush the windpipe causing strangulation and death. 
The students take notes. 
INSTRUCTOR #1 (CONT'D) Boxing your adversary's ears with proper force will cause his ear drums to burst and possibly result in bleeding in the brain. And death. 
EXT. BARRACKS - NIGHT 
It's dark. Byrd sits on a step, smoking a cigarette.     Barris approaches. 
BARRIS You're training me to be a killer. 
BYRD See, Chuck, I knew you were fairly bright. 
BARRIS I can't kill people.    My future is in television. 
BYRD Listen, you're thirty-two years old and you've achieved nothing. Jesus Christ was dead and alive again by thirty-three. Better get cracking. 
BARRIS I have ideas for shows. 
BYRD Oh, good. Why don't you spend another six months developing 'em while staring out the window at mommy's house next to poor dead Albert the dog. 
BARRIS How do you know all that? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BYRD I know everything about you, Chuck. For fuck's sake, I know which hand you jerk off with. 
Barris lifts his hands, tries to remember. 
BYRD (CONT'D) Right. Leave in the morning, if you want. But I'm here to tell you this is honest work for good pay. You'd be helping to make the world safer. And your country would be grateful. 
Byrd rises, stubs out his cigarette in his hand. 
BYRD (CONT'D) It'll toughen you up. 
Barris sits there staring into the blackness. 
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
Another big, frightening instructor stands before the class. Behind him is a full-sized diagram of a man which illustrates all major arteries and organs. He is demonstrating the proper way to grip a knife, then using the knife, he points to various sites on the body. 
Angle on Chuck Barris. He has copied the diagram of the man in his notebook and is writing "Carotoid artery carries blood to brain. Death in seconds." He then writes: "Game show idea: Slice of Life. Interesting!!" 
EXT. FIELD - DAY 
Several canvas dummies are propped up in the field. Barris and other students slash at the dummies with big knives. 
INT. WORKSHOP - DAY 
Barris and other students are assembling rifles. 
EXT. MUDDY FIELD - NIGHT 
Barris and other students crawl on their bellies through mud. 
INT. LABORATORY - DAY 
The severe instructor, in a lab coat, is mixing chemicals. 
YOUNG BARRIS I was just -- 
BYRD (softening) I like you. I really do. And you're gonna do fine tomorrow. And we're gonna become great friends. And you're gonna have a very nice little career. But you've got to grow up. There's a war on. 
YOUNG BARRIS What war? 
BYRD (walking away) That's not your concern. 
INT. MEXICAN HOTEL ROOM   -   NIGHT 
It's hot. There are two twin beds in the room. Byrd sleeps soundly in one. Barris lies in the other, eyes wide open. 
EXT. MEXICO CITY STREET - DAY 
Renda is buying a newspaper at the kiosk. He completes the transaction and takes a few steps with his paper. Barris blocks his way, holding a phrase book and shaking. 
BARRIS Excusa me, por favor, Senor. 
Renda stops. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) Donde es-bla ra-ba-blala los bloteros? 
RENDA No comprende. 
Renda tries to get away from this pesky tourist.   Barris follows him, calling after him. 
BARRIS Ra-bla-bla-mamos las minjares? 
Renda picks up his pace, as does Barris.   Benitez approaches. 
BENITEZ May I be of some assistance here? 
Renda appears relieved, until he feels the gun in his back. 
INT. CAR - DAY 
Renda's in the back between Barris and Benitez. Brazioni drives. Renda seems pale and nervous, as does Barris in his gaudy tourist wear and sunglasses. The car drives slowly through the crowded Mexico City streets. They arrive at a jammed intersection and are suddenly confronted with a big parade. It's Day of the Dead; the streets are filled with dancing skeletons. It's wild and frightening. Brazioni glances at Renda in the reaview mirror. 
BRAZIONI Day of the dead. 
EXT. FIELD - DAY 
The car stops in a deserted field. Barris gets out first. His shirt is soaked through with sweat. Suddenly there's a commotion inside the car. Renda has gotten hold of a gun. He shoots Brazioni and Benitez. Barris panics and dives behind the car. Renda steps cautiously outside of the car, looking for Barris. Barris grabs Renda's foot. Renda falls, the gun flies from his hand. Barris kicks the gun under the car, his own gun drawn. He points the gun at Renda, who is on his stomach. Barris doesn't shoot. He's scared, shaking wildly. Renda looks up at Barris, trying to figure him out. He slowly rises to his feet, turns to Barris with a pleading look in his eyes. 
RENDA Por favor. No me mates, senor.   Tengo tres bebes. Barris sucks in a deep gulp of air. His hand shakes.   He pulls out Spansh-English dictionary. 
BARRIS Again. 
RENDA Que? BARRIS Repitolo. Again. 
RENDA No me mates. Tengo tres bebes. Barris flips through the dictionary. A church bell chimes, startling Barris. His gun goes off accidentally and the bullet hits Renda in the face, tearing most of it away. Renda falls, but is still alive. He screams out of where his mouth was. A wedding party emerges from the distant church. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BARRIS Oh Christ.     Oh crap. 
Barris tries to stop Renda from screaming by covering the hole in Renda's face. Barris throws up, some of it landing on Renda's pants. He wipes his own mouth with his bloody hand and looks at the still screaming Renda. The churchgoers are starting to squint in Barris's direction. Barris shoots Renda again. And again and again and again and again. More blood spatters Barris's clothing and face. The church bell continues to chime. 
INT. AIRPLANE - DAY 
Barris and Byrd sit side-by-side in first class.    This time Barris has the window seat and stares out. 
BYRD Beautiful country, isn't it? 
YOUNG BARRIS Yeah. 
BYRD You did us proud, Chuck. 
Barris doesn't say anything. 
BYRD (CONT'D) Renda was a bad guy. He really was. 
BARRIS Yeah. 
INT. APARTMENT - EVENING 
Barris enters carrying an overnight bag and some mail. He flips on the hall light and stares at himself in a mirror. 
BARRIS (V.O.) I had changed. I could see it in my eyes. Something dark. 
Barris notices a fleck on the side of his nose.    It's dried blood. He distractedly rubs at it. 
EXT. FIELD - DAY 
Renda's contorted face in close-up as he is shot.   Blood spurting. Echoey church bells chime. 
RENDA No me mates. Yo tengo tres bebes. 
INT. APARTMENT - EVENING 
The bachelorette makes a mock-horrified expression as the studio audience erupts in laughter. Barris buries his face in his hands. 
INT. DATING GAME SET - DAY 
A brunette bachelorette asks a question. 
BRUNETTE BACHELORETTE Bachelor number one, what nationality are you? 
HANDSOME BACHELOR Well, my father is Welsh and my mother is Hungarian, so I guess that makes me Well- Hung. 
The audience goes wild.   Barris pulls at his hair. 
INT. DATING GAME SET - DAY 
A black bachelorette asks a question. 
BLACK BACHELORETTE Bachelor number three, I play the trombone. If I blew you, what would you sound like? 
The audience screams with delight. 
INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY 
Leonard Goldberg, a bunch of network executives, and Barris sit around a conference table and watch a tv. On it is The Dating Game. A black bachelor is responding to the trombone question.   He simulates the receiving of a blow job, moaning and writhing in his seat as the studio audience howls. Barris has his head in his hands. Goldberg signals an assistant, who switches off the television. The executives look quite grim. 
GOLDBERG Chuck, quite frankly these episodes are unairable. 
BARRIS Look, Len, the show's spontaneous, it's unscripted. That's it's charm. I can't control what people say. 
EXECUTIVE Be that as it may, Mr. Barris, we can't have black men getting blow jobs on national television! 
GOLDBERG The point isn't that he's black, Hank. 
EXECUTIVE (beat) Well, I know that. That's not what I meant. 
BARRIS Look, Len, nobody is indifferent to these shows. Right? And that's good. Show business must avoid indifference at all costs. 
EXECUTIVE Even when taste is involved? 
BARRIS Taste is just a word. 
EXECUTIVE You don't fuck with taste, my friend! 
BARRIS (uncomprehending) What does that even mean?   I don't even under -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GOLDBERG Chuck, we cannot air this stuff. That's it. If you can't figure out how to retain your spontaneity without the contestants being lewd, we're going to have to pull the show. 
INT. BAR - NIGHT 
Barris is drunk and brooding. He picks a fight with a big man who has unintentionally knocked into him at the bar. Barris is brutal and effective, utilizing the techniques he learned from one of the scary instructors at training camp. This gives him an idea. 
INT. DATING GAME SET - DAY 
The contestants are onstage.   Barris appears, warm and charming. 
BARRIS Hi, folks. Before we begin taping today, I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Peter Jenks of the Federal Communications Commission. 
The severe training camp instructor joins Barris onstage. 
INSTRUCTOR #1 (increasingly psychotic) Thank you, Mr. Barris. I don't know if any of you are aware of this, but it's a federal offense to make licentious remarks on a network television broadcoast. The penalty for this disgusting, un-American behavior is one year in prison or a ten thousand dollar fine or both. Anyone making a sick, subversive remark tonight will be arrested immediately. I will then personally escort the offender to federal prison for booking under edict number 364 of the Broadcast Act of 1963. And it's a long drive to that prison. Just you and me. No other witnesses -- 
BARRIS (jumping in) Any questions? 
There are none. The contestants are paralyzed with fear. Jenks is red-faced, trembling. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BARRIS (CONT'D) Okay.   Have fun, everybody!' 
EXT. TERRACE - DAY 
The actual Barris being interviewed. 
ACTUAL BARRIS Sometimes as a younger man I stretched the truth to get what I wanted. "Through all the lying days of my youth/I swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun;/Now I may whither into the truth." Yeats. You heard of him? 
INTERVIEWER (O.C.) Yeah.   Of course. 
ACTUAL BARRIS Sure you have. (beat) Anyway, my little lie worked. We aired and become a big hit. A phenomenon, really. 
INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE, BARRIS PRODUCTIONS - DAY 
SUBTITLE: BARRIS PRODUCTIONS, LOS ANGELES, 1967 
This is the sixties and the office is crazily appointed. Street signs, funny posters, faux Tiffany lamps, mobiles, lava lamps, an inflatable sex doll, etc. Barris, 36, is behind his desk, feet up and on the phone. He wears a t- shirt and jeans and loafers. This is a new Barris, confident and successful and hip and relaxed and slovenly. Outside in the bullpen area we hear the hustle and bustle, laughing and screaming of a busy but casual office. 
BARRIS (into phone) Terrific, Rod! Yeah, I'll get back to you on Monday. Great. Thanks. Bye. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) C'mere, Ronnie. I want to show you something neat. It's okay. 
The fat bachelor enters the courtyard. 
EXT. TERRACE - DAY 
ACTUAL BARRIS I felt bad about Ronnie. But really I did that ugly, fat, stupid kid a favor. He was ugly and fat and stupid. More life wouldn't have changed that for him. No woman would ever have loved him. That's just the brutal truth, y'know? 
INT. LONDON HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Barris enters the room, shaky and scared. 
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Barris rips open the Polaroid box, pulls out the foil paper that protects the film, rips that open and pulls out a small white plastic vial. Barris greases the vial with Vaseline and sticks it up his ass. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
He looks at himself in the mirror, naked and pathetic. There is a knock at the door. He stiffens, grabs his gun and pads out of the bathroom. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Barris peeks out the peephole.   We see a fish-eye view of Patricia Watson. 
BARRIS Olivia? 
PATRICIA It's Patricia, actually. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER 
Barris and Patricia sit sipping champagne.   Both are drunk. 
PATRICIA ... and so then I spent a year in Operation Chaos, inside the anti-war movement as an agent provocateur, nudging it toward violence in order to discred it. That was fun. I got to wear granny glasses. 
BARRIS Sounds fun. So tell me, Patricia, why'd you come up here tonight? 
PATRICIA I don't know. You're sort of cute in a homely way. And it's always lonely when that civilian you're fucking calls out the name off your fake passport. 
BARRIS "All the information I have about myself is from forged documents." 
PATRICIA Nabokov. 
Barris is thrilled and kisses her. It begins to turn hot and heavy. Suddenly Barris pulls away. 
BARRIS Actually, I just gotta go into the bathroom and take care of something. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PATRICIA No, baby.    Leave the microfilm in. 
EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY 
A plane lands. 
INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT TERMINAL, CUSTOMS - DAY 
Barris waits sweatily in line with a small a carry-on suitcase. When the line moves, he walks as if perhaps he has something up his ass. A customs agent walks past the line with a dog. The dog sniffs Barris's ass in passing. 
EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY 
Barris steps out of the terminal. A black limo pulls up. The back door opens and Barris gets in. 
INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS 
Seated in the back are Jim Byrd and Simon Oliver, 50. Oliver is pure ivy league with a pipe. When he speaks it is with an affected British accent. Byrd is pissy. 
BYRD Hey, buddy. This is Simon Oliver. 
BARRIS Hey. 
BYRD Everything go okay?    You don't look too good. 
OLIVER Mr. Barris, do not ever again jeopardize one of my missions by killing a game show contestant. Is that understood? 
BARRIS You're welcome, pal. 
OLIVER Do I make myself clear? 
BARRIS Fuck you!    They're my contestants. 
OLIVER Amateur.

INT. EMPTY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Barris and Penny are having sex on the floor. 
PENNY So, man, are you seeing anyone? 
BARRIS Nobody serious. You? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PENNY No.   I think we should get married. 
BARRIS Aw, Pen, don't start -- 
PENNY No, listen, it makes sense. You and I feel exactly the same about marriage, right? How much bullshit it is, right? And the odds of us finding someone else with the exact same view on it are small. So, it makes sense. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Barris, 50, types away. He is sweaty and naked except for a towel draped over his head. 
BARRIS (V.O.) I liked Penny. I even loved her in my way. But the idea of tying myself down for the rest of my life... I remember my parents' marriage. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CHILDHOOD KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Barris, five, sits at the dinner table with his parents. His father, dressed in a dental smock, stares down at his plate as he eats. His mother absently chews and stares vacantly into space. 
MOTHER We need a new ice box. 
The father shrugs. 
INT. DATING GAME SET - DAY 
The set, which holds four couples, divides in the middle to reveal a new refrigerator. 
ANNOUNCER A brand new Amana refrigerator-freezer with automatic ice maker! 
One of the couples is cheering and screaming hysterically, happy and in love and kissing. The other couples look disappointed and angry at their spouses. 
We pull back to reveal we're watching this on a tv in: 
INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - MORNING 
The office is filled to capacity with with hippy-like employees watching The Newlywed Game. Many sit on the floor, jammed up against each other. A few women are nursing infants. Someone passes a joint. Barris sits behind his desk, with a "Make Love Not War" helmet on his head, his feet up, and a guitar in his lap. 
BARRIS Beautiful. Did you see that? How much they loved each other just then? That's what it's all about, kiddies. 
Everyone agrees.   Someone switches off the tv. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) Okay, guys, new business. We're winning our slots every week. 
Everyone cheers. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) But that means we need you Bandits to get on the contestant mill. Our supply of dumbfucks is lagging behind our demand for dumbfucks. And I'm gonna be introducing three new shows in the coming months: The Parent Game, The Game Game, and the Dollar Ninety-Eight Beauty Pageant, so we're gonna really need you guys to carry your weight. Nuff said. Any other business? 
EMPLOYEE #1 Yeah. Rick took four slices of pizza at lunch yesterday. Everyone else only got two. 
BARRIS Oooh.    Is that true, Rick?    Where are you? 
RICK Here.    No, it's not true. 
BARRIS Any other witnesses to this alleged infraction? 
EMPLOYEE #2 I saw it.    He took four.    I only got one. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BARRIS Rick, you're dead meat, buddy. (shoots Rick with finger) I sentence you to... dance for us in today's post-meeting version of "Out of Limits" featuring the musical stylings of the CBP Stompers. 
Everyone cheers. 
RICK Aw, Chuck. 
BARRIS Get up here, you rascule, you. 
Rick heads up to Barris's desk. Everyone laughs. A few employees have joined Barris at his desk with instruments. They break into a raucous banjo version of "Out of Limits." Rick dances. Everyone's laughing and clapping. 
MONTAGE 
As "Out of Limits" continues, now the actual version, we see montage of Barris shooting, stabbing, and garroting various foreign-looking people in strange, murky locations intercut with Barris having sex with Patricia Watson in different bedrooms and motel rooms, Barris dancing with Patricia in various exotic locales, and Barris on the set for his many game shows, happily directing the bustling activity. 
INT. RANCH-STYLE LIVING ROOM - DAY 
The actual Jim Lange, host of The Dating Game. 
MONICA Have a seat. 
Barris sits on the couch. Monica sits next to him. Mindy is in the background, futzing around in the kitchen area. 
MONICA (CONT'D) So... have you accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior, Chuck? 
BARRIS (beat) Yes, I have. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. MONICA'S LIVING ROOM - A BIT LATER 
Barris, Monica, and Mindy sit on the couch watching a religious show on television. 
EXT. TERRACE - DAY 
ACTUAL BARRIS Yeah, I remember that religious girl, sure. Monica Something. Fleming. Oh God, she had the softest, fleeciest clam I ever experienced. It took a little more work than usual, but I got in there, baby. (smacks lips, then stares off into space) It was some clam. Oh Lordy. You get old, y'know, but the taste for soft clam, it just doesn't go away. This is the great tragedy of getting old. 
INT. BARRIS PRODUCTIONS - DAY 
The room is abuzz with activity. Lots of people on the phone talking. A potential Newlywed Game couple being interviewed. Monica sits in the waiting area, eavesdrops on the interview with the Newlywed Couple. 
WOMAN Getting married to Alan is the best thing I've ever done. It's just so wonderful knowing that you've got someone by your side through everything for he rest of your life. 
The couple kisses. 
LORETTA 'kay, Mon.     He's off. 
Monica enters the office. 
INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Monica enters.   Barris wears a deerstalker cap. 
BARRIS My sweet little clamato. 
Monica leans down and kisses Barris. 
MONICA I'm pregnant. 
Barris's eye twitches. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MONICA (CONT'D) (crying) I can't be pregnant, Chuck. 
BARRIS Is it mine? 
Monica looks at him incredulously, flings an ashtray at him, misses. She sits at the desk, looks glumly out the window. 
MONICA I can't believe you asked me that. 
BARRIS I know. I'm sorry. (beat) But you're sure, right? 
MONICA I hate you so much right now. 
BARRIS Look, we'll take care of it. 
MONICA How?    Are you gonna marry me? 
BARRIS (carefully) Well, no. Not at this point. 
MONICA I'm not murdering my baby! (weeping) I can't... do that. Please... 
Barris sighs.    He touches Monica's hand.

Barris and Monica sit in first class. Barris stares out the window. Monica stares straight ahead. 
BARRIS Beautiful country, isn't it? 
EXT. MEXICAN ALLEY - DAY

Barris supports her and leads her into the office.

LORETTA Rod Flexner's here. 
BARRIS Shit piss fuck, send him in. 
Flexner enters.    He's a suit. 
FLEXNER Chuck!    Great to see you. 
BARRIS What's up, Rod? 
FLEXNER Well, the thing is, Chuck, some of your shows aren't doing too well in the old ratings war. The Family Game, for one. 
BARRIS Okay. 
We move into Barris's eyes. 
INT. FAMILY GAME SET 
The show is in progress. Suddenly shots are fired from offstage. The host and contestants are slaughtered. It's bloody and violent. 
INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - DAY 
We're on Barris's eyes. 
FLEXNER And How's Your Mother-in-Law is, quite frankly, in the toilet, Chuck.

INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - DAY 
FLEXNER So I've been put in the unfortunate position of having to inform you that the network is canceling all four of these shows. Now don't shoot me, Chuck, I'm just the messenger. 
INT. BAR - NIGHT 
Barris drinks alone.   He's sullen and sauced. 
BARRIS (to bartender) They killed my babies. Just like that. I pushed them into the world through the birth canal of my imagination. Lovingly. Tenderly. Where's the humanity of these people? 
BARTENDER The fucking bastards. 
BARRIS What am I gonna do now? (sees pretty woman) Hey there, can I buy you a drink? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LARGE MAN What are you blind, asshole?   This lady's with me. 
BARRIS (screaming) Fuck you! 
The large man stands to face Barris. He is very large. Barris stands. The man swings at Barris. Barris easily deflects the punch, grabs the man's forearm and breaks it with a sickening crack. The man screams. Barris gets him in a chokehold from behind. The man whimpers and gags. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) Let's see, if I remember correctly, the next move breaks your neck, which kills you instantly or paralyzes you. Depending on your luck. 
LARGE MAN Please. 
BARRIS (lets go) Get out of here, you pussy faggot piece of shit dog-shit shithead. 
The large man hurries from the bar. Everyone in the bar, including the large man's date, watches Barris. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) (to the woman) Hi. I'm Chuck Barris, tv producer.   Have you ever done any acting? 
BYRD (O.S.) Over here, Strawberry-dick. 
Barris looks over and makes out Byrd sitting on a rock with a view of L.A. spread out in front of him. Barris joins him. 
BARRIS Jesus, how do you know these things? 
BYRD We even know what she actually thought it tasted like. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BARRIS Really? I could never find that out. What did she think? 
BYRD It's a "need to know", my friend.   So tell me, what can I do you for? 
BARRIS I could really use an assignment, Jim. To straighten my head. 
BYRD I got something for your head. 
INT. DATING GAME SET 
A Dating Game couple waits anxiously for host Jim Lange to announce their destination. 
JIM LANGE ... and we're the sending the two of you for three days and three nights to beautiful... West Berlin! 
The couple screams excitedly by reflect, but as the destination sinks in, their perplexity becomes apparent. 
EXT. WEST BERLIN STREET - DAY 
Barris and the Dating Game couple walk along. It's cold and gray and they all wear heavy coats. The couple wear cameras around their necks. Nobody looks happy. 
INT. BEER HALL - NIGHT 
Barris sits in the corner of this noisy, smoky place. He has a stein of beer and reads a paper as a group of drunken Germans in the background sing a song. Patricia Watson approaches and sits. Barris looks up and smiles. 
BARRIS Treesh. 
PATRICIA Leibchen. (kisses him, sits) So, here's what we got.   Name's Hans Colbert. (pulls out photos) Other side of the wall.   We don't like him very much. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BARRIS (singing Toot-toot-tootsie) Bye-bye, Colbert, bye-bye. 
PATRICIA You'll work with a kraut named Keeler. He's been trailing Colbert for a month now. Knows the routine. Keeler's a drunk, so you stay sober and take charge. 
BARRIS (collecting photos) Done and done. See you after? 
PATRICIA Prove how much you love me, baby.   Kill for me. Then I'm all yours. 
INT. TUNNEL - DAY 
Barris crawls through a long dirt tunnel. Telephone cables run along the floor. An occasional bare bulb lights the way. 
INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - DAY 
A middle-aged man stands in his underwear at a mirror and shaves. The stall shower pushes away from the wall revealing a hole. Barris steps through it, covered in dust. He nods at the shaving man. He nods back, hands Barris a gun and a change of clothes, and continues shaving. 
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER 
Barris exits the apartment building in the clean clothes. We see the East Berlin side of the wall in the background. A car pulls up and Barris gets in. 
INT. CAR, RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY 
Barris sits in the parked car with Keeler, a heavyset, silent German man with nicotine stained fingers and teeth. He is constantly smoking and writing in a tiny notebook. There is a long silence. 
BARRIS What you writing, Sig? 
KEELER I am keeping track of all the goings on on this street. 
Barris looks out the window. There is nothing going on, yet Keeler keeps writing. More silence. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BARRIS Hey, Keeler, a bird just flew by. 
KEELER Yah.   I know how to do my job. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. PARKED CAR - NIGHT 
Barris and Keeler are still in the car. Keeler continues to smoke and write. A well-rested, happy-looking Colbert walks by with a group of people. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. PARKED CAR - AFTERNOON 
Picard drives fast. Barris eyes him suspiciously, fingers his gun. Picard spots a Fiat in his rearview mirror. 
PICARD Merde. KGB. They know who you are, Monsieur Barris. It is their intention to kill you very much in East Berlin. 
Barris checks in the passenger side mirror. 
BARRIS Merde!   MERDE! PICARD Not to worry, my friend. 
Picard speeds up dramatically, but continues to drive calmly. Barris is agitated. 
PICARD (CONT'D) I am Paul Picard, by the way. Nice to meet you. Do not worry, I am not KGB.            I do not want to kill you, I want you to live a long happy life and have many dancing grandchildren to admire. 
Picard screeches around a corner, then another one.            He's lost the Fiat, for the moment. 
EXT. QUIET EAST BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING 
Picard's car stops at the curb. Picard and Barris emerge. Picard opens the trunk. He lifts out a big folded-up clump of rubber with a an engine mounted on it. 
BARRIS What the hell is that? 
PICARD Your ride, Monsieur Barris. 
Picard unfolds the rubber mass. He pulls a cord and it begins to inflate. It is an airplane, a one person inflatable plane. 
BARRIS No fucking way. 
PICARD It's quite reliable and easy to operate. It will get you over the wall. Or you can stay here. In the German Democratic Republic. I will arrange for you to get a good factory job. No, you must fly, like Daedalus before you, to the freedom of the west. 
BARRIS Christ.   What about you? 
PICARD They do not catch me, monsieur. This is my talent, to get away always. In guerre. In amour. This is my talent, and perhaps this is my curse. 
EXT. BERLIN WALL - DAY 
The fully-inflated rubber plane flies down the street, dipping and rising erratically. The noise is deafening. Barris lies on his stomach and steers, looking petrified.    He approaches the wall and manages to get the plane over it. The plane is shot by a soldier. Air hisses out. 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY 
Barris sits on a park bench.   Jim Byrd approaches, sits. 
BYRD (chuckling) So, did you have a nice flight? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BARRIS Fuck you, Jim. It was terrifying. 
BYRD Seems the KGB knew exactly what you were up to. You were there to kill Colbert, they were there to kill you. I'm thinking we got a mole. So much hate in the world, Chuck. 
BARRIS Am I in danger still? 
BYRD Jesus, yes. KGB didn't go out of business since yesterday, so far as I know. You're fucked, Chuck. But our main concern should be: if they know who you are, they know who I am. 
BARRIS Fuck off.     What do we do? 
BYRD Bow out. Lay low. That's what I'm gonna do. You're lucky you have another career to immerse yourself in. 
INT. REHEARSAL HALL - DAY 
Barris sits with a several network executive and some other staff members watching a fat man tap dance badly and, because of his weight, extremely loudly. It's painful for everybody to watch. The fat man finishes. 
BARRIS Thank you.     Thanks.   That was great. 
The fat smiles and exits.       Barris puts his head in his hands. 
EXECUTIVE WOMAN I don't know, Chuck. It's looking bleak. 
BARRIS There's gotta be somebody in America with some talent. Ted Mack got bookings every week. 
The executives look at each other. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) Bring in the next thing. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
An assistant opens the door and a middle-aged woman in pale blue polyester pants and Joan Crawford painted on eyebrows enters with a guitar. She begins to sing a folk song, very sincerely, in a very off-key monotone. It's unbearable and depressing. Barris glances over at the executive; she's checking her watch again. The song is endless.    Barris's eyes grow cloudy. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. FIELD - DAY 
This is the same field where Renda was shot. Now, the folksinging woman is in the field singing. Barris pulls out a gun and aims it at the woman. Her eyes widen in terror, but she keeps singing. A church bell chimes and Barris shoots her. She flies back, spurting blood. Her guitar hits the ground with a twang. 
INT. REHEARSAL HALL - DAY 
Barris snaps out of his fantasy with renewed energy      The folksinger is still droning on. 
BARRIS (ushering out) Thank you. Thank you. We'll be in touch. That was wonderful.

EXECUTIVE WOMAN You lack confidence, that's all. 
BARRIS I lack confidence? 
EXECUTIVE WOMAN But we'll take care of that. We'll get you some confidence powder. Leave that to us. 
BARRIS Confidence powder?

INT. WINGS - CONTINUOUS 
Barris snorts some cocaine. We hear the act and audience "booing" and yelling "Gong him!" in the background. 
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
The actual Jaye P. Morgan is being interviewed. 
ACTUAL JAYE P. MORGAN Chuck was real different on stage and off. Very tense. He was always looking over his shoulder. Even when we were fucking. Sort of an enigma. 
INT. GONG SHOW SET - DAY 
Barris dances onstage with Gene Gene the Dancing Machine. 
INT. SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM - DAY 
The actual Gene Gene is being interviewed. 
GENE GENE Oh yeah, a real Jekyll and Hyde. Sometimes nice as you please. Give you the shirt off his back. Other times he'd rant like a crazy man. I remember once he screamed at me that I didn't know anything about dancing. "Nijinsky," he yelled, "now there was a dancer!" 
INT. GONG SHOW SET - DAY 
A black guy with weird teeth and a speech impediment attempts stand-up. He looks petrified. 
BLACK COMEDIAN Today I had a bad day today...

BLACK COMEDIAN (CONT'D) It was so bad, my wife didn't even know how to cook. (MORE)

CONTINUED: BLACK COMEDIAN (CONT'D) That barracuda took an egg, put it in a pot of water, and burned the water. We had to rush that to the hospital. 
The audience boos. 
BLACK COMEDIAN (CONT'D) My mother-in-law... 
The booing continues. The comedian can't take it. He looks disoriented. He turns away from the audience and puts his head in his hands. Jamie Farr gongs him. 
EXT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY 
The actual Jamie Farr sits next to the pool. In the background we see a couple of kids with enormous noses splashing around in the water. 
JAMIE FARR Chuck used to love to discuss philosophy. I think he was very saddened that the public saw him as this sort of spastic moron. I remember at the time I was reading Wittgenstein. And Chuck was just thrilled to have someone else in addition to Rex Reed to talk about that stuff with. 
INT. BARRIS'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 
Barris lies in bed next to Patricia. It's 12:30 AM. He's chatting on the phone, lazily twirling the cord. Patricia reads. 
WAITER Are you gentlemen ready to order? 
KEELER I'll have the shrimp scampi and a green salad. 
WAITER And for you, sir. 
KEELER Um, Just give me a steak.    Rare. 
WAITER Thank you. 
The waiter leaves.    Keeler sips his drink, stares at Barris. 
KEELER "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy whole might. Work while it is called, for the night cometh wherein no man can work." 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
BARRIS That's Carlyle! 
KEELER Yes. 
BARRIS It's amazing you should quote him.   He's my hero. 
KEELER I read in a book recently that killing your first man is like making love to your first woman. Every smell, every nuance, you remember with a special allure, as if the acts had occured outside civilization, outside time. And when the allure is gone, you are condemned. 
BARRIS Condemned? 
KEELER I am condemned to live the rest of my life outside civilization. You will be too, my good friend. 
Barris looks into Keeler's hollow eyes. 
EXT. TERRACE - DAY 
The actual Barris puffs on his cigar. 
ACTUAL BARRIS The next day I heard Keeler offed himself. 
EXT. L.A. HOTEL - NIGHT 
Keeler falls silently in slow motion from a very high window. 
ACTUAL BARRIS (V.O.) You never really know in the world of espionage if something labeled a suicide actually is a suicide. But he was dead. That I knew. 
INT. MARTONI'S - NIGHT 
Barris eats dinner with Penny.   Barris seems depressed. Penny is reserved.

PENNY When you called, I wasn't gonna come. 
BARRIS I'm glad you did, Pen. 
PENNY I said to myself, enough.      Enough of this jerk already. Enough. 
BARRIS I could see how you would feel that way. 
PENNY But I've come upon something interesting through my delvings into human psychology. It's called TA, Transactual Analysis. 
BARRIS Transactional Analysis. 
PENNY Now see, by correcting me you're responding as "Parent" to my "Child." (authoritative voice) "Here's the proper way to say this word, Penny." But that's okay. As long as we both understand that's what you're doing. Y'know, I'm okay, you're okay. So what's wrong, Chuck? Are you okay? 
BARRIS A guy I knew killed himself last night. 
PENNY My God. Everyone you know kills themselves. Or tries. Who is it this time? 
BARRIS You don't know him.   A stagehand. 
PENNY Why'd he do it? 
BARRIS He didn't like his work anymore. 
PENNY Is being a stagehand really bad or something? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
BARRIS (beat) Yeah, it's pretty bad. 
Patricia storms up to the table. 
PATRICIA You were supposed to meet me at The Palm two hours ago. 
BARRIS Oh fuck, I forgot. 
PENNY Who is this? 
BARRIS I'll take it! Don't hang up! 
Barris picks up the phone. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) Hello? 
TUVIA (O.S.) Hello, is this Chuck Barris? 
BARRIS Yes. 
TUVIA (O.S.) Oh, this is Tuvia Feldman.    I don't know if you remember me -- 
BARRIS Of course I do.

(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GUY Hey, Chuck, I got a talent. 
BARRIS 
Not now. 
GUY Just take a second. 
The guy gets down on all fours and starts barking and panting like a dog. It is a repulsive and frightening sight, but Barris becomes transfixed by it and cannot take his eyes off the guy. 
TUVIA (O.C.) Chuck? 
Barris tears his eyes away from the dog guy to look at Tuvia. She is an older middle-aged lady. Younger than Chuck, but clearly of no interest to him. The disappointment on his face is palpable. 
TUVIA (CONT'D) It's Tuvia! Remember? Hi! 
BARRIS (V.O.) Old Tuvia. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) Hi. 
TUVIA You look great. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. BAR - LATER 
Barris sits in a booth across from Tuvia. The relationship has shifted once again. Now middle-aged Tuvia is trying to flirt. As they talk, she touches his arm repeatedly. She laughs at everything he says. She reapplies lipstick as they talk. There's a quiet desperation in her eyes. Barris is pleasant but unengaged. 
BARRIS (V.O.) Ah, Tuvia. The fantasy of Tuvia forever cast out by the reality of Tuvia. Finally, because of my fame and her desperate straits, her poverty and single parenthood, she was going to submit to me. Finally I could've had her. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: BARRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D) I could've had what had so long eluded me. But now she was old and I wasn't interested.

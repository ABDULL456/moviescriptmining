1   EXT. HALFWAY HOUSE PORCH. DAY                               1 
KYM, a darkly beautiful girl in her early 20's, is smoking furiously on the porch of an URBAN HALFWAY HOUSE. She glances impatiently at her watch and presses her ear to her cell phone. As she exhales, WE HEAR the rumble of thunder. 
Irritated, she crams her cell phone into her bag. ROSA a halfway house staff nurse is patiently handling WALTER, an irate patient who is screeching... 
WALTER I want my fucking Zippo now! Walter starts yanking at his hair. 
ROSA Walter, that is a behavior... 
WALTER (raking his nails against his forearm) Fuck you! 
ROSA And you are making a choice. Her cell phone rings... 
ROSA (to Walter) Hold on...Hello? 
WALTER God! 
KYM Don't you get it yet, Waldo? She's making a choice not to give you your lighter because you'll torch the Self-Help library again. 
WALTER I'm Walter. Kill anybody recently? Run anybody over with a fucking car? 
Kym grinds her cigarette under her heel and blows smoke but gives no signal that she's heard anything. She yanks her cell phone out of her bag as... 
A tan Mercedes STATION WAGON pulls up in front of the House.

ROSA (to Kym) That them? 
KYM Yes. Finally. 
Rosa takes two of Kym's several bags. They are oddly matched. A Coach tote, a fake Prada, a Gristedes bag, and a World Wildlife Fund tote bag. 
WALTER You're not letting her get behind the wheel are you? Are you? 
ROSA Walter, you are only responsible for yourself. (To Kym) This is all your stuff? 
KYM You know you never gave me your cell number. 
ROSA (sotto) It was a mistake. I'm lucky I didn't get fired. We've discussed this. (She offers her hand) Good luck. 
Kym doesn't appear to have heard her but she shakes the hand barely... so very, very faintly. Kym's dad, PAUL BUCHMAN, a tired, prosperous man in his late 50's steps around the car and trots up the porch steps. He is wearing a big smile and his glasses are foggy. They hug. Kym talks rapidly over his shoulder... 
KYM Oh my god. Here you are. I thought you were going to abandon me in rehab. It's 12:30. You guys are half an hour late. I've been standing here with these lunatics. You look so great. Paul offers his hand to Rosa. 
PAUL Hello. I'm Paul Buchman.

ROSA I'm Rosa. We met last time you came up. 
PAUL (doesn't remember) Of course, of course. 
KYM Let's go, let's go. Where is everybody? CAROL, a handsome woman in her 40's, waves from the car. 
KYM (loudly) Hey Carol. How are ya? 
CAROL Hello Kym. 
She offers the can.

KYM I prefer Pepsi from the fountain. 
3   EXT. MINI-MART PARKING LOT. DAY.                            3 
Carol looks at Paul. He is fiddling with the dashboard. 
4   INT. MINI-MART. DAY.                                        4 Kym fills her Big Gulp at the fountain and pays at the counter. The COUNTER GIRL gives her change. 
COUNTER GIRL I saw you on COPS. Kym appears not to have heard. She pockets her change and leaves. 
5   INT. STATION WAGON. DAY.                                    5 
As Paul drives through a bucolic, well-to-do neighborhood featuring a beautiful old church. 
6   EXT. THE BUCHMAN HOUSE. DAY.                                6 The station wagon pulls into a CIRCULAR DRIVEWAY lined with trees and bushes of beautiful blue hydrangea. There are several late model cars parked in the driveway of the SPRAWLING, SHINGLED HOUSE. Young people crawling everywhere in the midst of WEDDING PREPARATION, wrapping garlands and hanging paper lanterns. A LITTLE GIRL tosses rose petals in the swimming pool. The atmosphere is slightly punch drunk and friendly. 
Paul unloads Kym's bags. 
KYM I'll do it, Dad. 
She doesn't. 
7   INT. BUCHMAN LIVING ROOM. DAY.                                7 
Kym charges into the house where NORMAN SKLEAR and more friends of Rachel are decorating. They stare at her as she runs up the stairs to the second floor. CAMERA RUNS ALL THE 
WAY UP WITH HER. 
We hear... 
RACHEL'S VOICE OFF Can we raise this hem half an inch? 
EMMA'S VOICE OFF Yeah, yeah. Here, let me just... 
8   INT. UPSTAIRS. DAY. CONTINUOUS --                             8 
Kym slams open the master bedroom door and finds her older sister, RACHEL, trying on her wedding dress with the help of her best friend EMMA. Radiant and sexy, Rachel glows like an angel in her creamy white and gold sari. Emma has pins in her mouth and a tape measure around her neck. 
KYM Oh my god, you are just mi-nute! 
RACHEL Kymmie! 
EMMA (to Kym) You can't smoke in here-- Rachel and Kym squeal and embrace. Rachel is slightly awkward as Emma frantically tries to keep the billowing fabric from combustion. 
KYM Ow! 
RACHEL I have pins all over me. You look great! 
KYM I'm fat. Rehab makes you fat. All the vending machines. Look at you, missy! I'd swear to god you were puking again! 
(CONTINUED)

RACHEL Hah! 
EMMA Kym! 
KYM Emma! (To Rachel) No seriously, you're so tiny it's like you're Asian. Dad wants us to sleep in the same room so you'll be able to watch me while he's asleep and I won't sneak out of the house and blow dealers and shoot heroin. 
RACHEL Dad did not say "blow dealers." 
KYM I told him I'd just sleep in Ethan's room. 
A DIFFERENT NURSE is waiting by the sinks examining her teeth in the mirror. Kym bangs open the door of her stall with her foot. The door swings back and Kym spills her sample all over herself. 
KYM Piss! 
16   EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER. DAY.                               16 
As she runs up the OUTSIDE STAIRCASE Kym wipes at her shirt with a wet paper towel. She yanks open the door and a bird poops on her. 
KYM Shit! 
17   INT. COMMUNITY CENTER MEETING ROOM. DAY.                    17 
Narcotics Anonymous Meeting. Chairs, light. An ATTRACTIVE GUY is sharing. Kym slams in, frazzled and late. A few people look at her as she grabs a folding chair from a stack leaning against the wall and the other chairs slide to the floor with a huge clatter. 
KYM 
COCKSUCKER! 
ATTRACTIVE GUY Only once. My dealer. I was really broke. The room breaks up. Kym struggles to rearrange the fallen chairs. She is pissed. 
ATTRACTIVE GUY Let's see...that was Tuesday... 
18   INT. COMMUNITY CENTER MEETING ROOM. LATER.                  18 
PASTOR MEL, a guest speaker, shares details of his struggles inside the "12 Step" Process. Kym, like everyone present, is riveted.

21   EXT. BUCHMAN HOUSE. DAY.                                  21 
Sweaty and fed up with Carol's bike, Kym cycles into the Buchman driveway. Paul has been watching for her out the kitchen window while doing dishes. He waves and yells to his wife. 
PAUL Carol, she's here! 
KYM Where did you think I was? 
PAUL I made you a sandwich, sweetheart! Meatloaf! 
Kym's shoulders slump. 
Watching from an upstairs window, Rachel observes Kym wheel the bike up the driveway and Paul hurrying from the kitchen to meet her, carrying a meat loaf sandwich and a glass of milk. There is an awkward exchange of items. Paul hugs and mushes Kym and kisses her on the forehead. Rachel opens the window, calls down. 
RACHEL Kymberly! 
22   EXT. BUCHMAN BACKYARD. DAY.                               22 
Fiancee SIDNEY, sexy, compact, thirties, and best man KIERAN, are stringing lights all over the house and yard. Kieran is on a ladder. He is the same ATTRACTIVE GUY from the meeting. Sidney is completely wrapped, chest to knees, in twinkly white lights and he unspools himself as needed. Rachel arrives with Kym who is holding the aircraft carrier sized meatloaf sandwich that's oozing lettuce and ketchup and the enormous glass of milk. She holds them both like they're suspended in formaldehyde. Emma is working on her tan. 
RACHEL No. You guys are not getting my design concept.

SIDNEY Oh. I thought you said Satan Claus. 
KIERAN I thought she said Panty Hose. Or Panda Claws. 
EMMA Pandas are endangered. 
RACHEL I know. We're having an endangered Panda fleeing for its life for the ice sculpture. Or impaling itself on some bamboo. Kym! This is Sidney Williams, my betrothed. Sidney, meet my sister, Kym. 
KYM Oh my god. You're black. (To Rachel) Sorry I called him a dawg. 
RACHEL That's fine. 
RACHEL Because. 
(CONTINUED) 
24   CONTINUED:                                               24 
KYM What does that mean? 
RACHEL I wasn't entirely sure when you were coming or even if you'd make it. 
Kym looks sharply at her. 
RACHEL I wasn't sure if you'd have time for a fitting. 
KYM Bullshit. It's a sari. You take a bolt of cloth and wrap it around you. Jesus Christ I've been home one day and I can't get a straight answer out of anybody. 
RACHEL What are you talking about? 
KYM I'm talking about Dad offering me food every ten seconds... 
RACHEL Dad offers Irish Hunger Strikers food every ten seconds. 
KYM No. He has to know where I am and what I'm doing all the time because he has never resolved his own trust issues. 
EMMA That's odd. 
KYM Shut up. 
EMMA Blow me. 
RACHEL Oh, leave Dad alone. 
(CONTINUED) 
24   CONTINUED:                                               24 
KYM I'd love to but he won't let me. I feel him watching me all the time. And Carol and you guys too. 
EMMA I know I have nothing better to think about. 
KYM Everybody's looking at me like I'm the visiting sociopath. What are you people waiting for me to do? Burn the house down? They both look at her. 
KYM That was a mattress fire and it wasn't even at home! It was on a sleep over! God! I should just get HAZMAT tattooed on my forehead for you people. 
RACHEL Stop! You're like a harpy. Is being my "Maid of Honor" this important to you? I didn't think you gave a shit. 
Beat. 
KYM How could you fucking say that to me? 
RACHEL Jesus. Emma! 
EMMA What? 
RACHEL Emma, would you be horribly offended and hurt if I asked you to step down as... (exaggerated, practically with quote fingers) ..."Maid of Honor?" 
EMMA Yes. 
(CONTINUED) 
24   CONTINUED:                                               24 
KYM Now Emma's got another reason to hate me. Like she needed one. 
EMMA Is it what you want? 
For an instant, conflict and pain flicker over Rachel's sweet face. 
RACHEL Not really. 
RACHEL I have no memory of that whatsoever. 
EMMA Do you remember trying to outrun him and leading him on a high speed chase across 96th street? 
RACHEL Gotta say no. 
(CONTINUED) 
27   CONTINUED:                                               27 
EMMA Well I would like to share with everyone that Miss Rachel-before she got her license or even had any idea how to drive- out maneuvered an irate, screaming cab driver across 96th street to the East river, handily avoiding two EMT guys loading an old lady on a gurney, while at the same time, applying Cocofudge Lip Gloss in the rearview mirror. 
Bravos all around. 
EMMA Wait, wait. She actually got the number of one of the E.M.T guys and went out with him. Twice. 
KYM (loudly) Was that the guy with the peroxide hair? Abby, not looking at her daughter, shushes her. 
EMMA Anyway, when the taxi driver finally caught up with us, Rachel talked him down from his Middle Eastern fury in pretend Farsi, and ended up using his radio thing to call his dispatcher and recommend this guy for a commendation. 
RACHEL Mahamoud! Such a nice man. 
EMMA We were driving so fast! It was one of the more exhilarating moments in my life...sadly...but I knew that Miss Rachel would make it okay. So here's to you, my dear, dear friend. A woman who can drive fast, pick up a paramedic, make up languages and get you home in one piece. Sidney, you are a lucky bastard. 
SIDNEY Hear hear.

27   CONTINUED:                                                  27 
RACHEL Where? Where? 
Abby smiles broadly at Rachel and blows her a kiss. 
Kym rises with her glass and takes Emma's place on stage. She glows in the candlelight. 
KYM (for the crowd) Relax, it's seltzer. Low giggles. 
KYM (CONT'D) Hello. I'm Shiva the destroyer and your harbinger of doom for the evening. I want to thank you all for coming and welcome you even though I haven't seen most of you since my latest stretch in the Big House... 
Scattered low giggles. 
KYM (CONT'D) You all look fabulous. During the twenty minutes I was not in the hole for making a shiv out of my toothbrush, I actually did participate in the infamous 12 Step program. 12 Steps. Step-ball- change, step-ball-change. I'm still waiting for the change part. Some guests laugh. Sidney grins. Carol, Paul, Rachel, and Abby sit silently. Andrew moves in towards his wife. 
KYM (CONT'D) But as they say, relapse is an almost always inevitable component of recovery, God knows I've got high marks in that mode! 
Everyone is staring at Kym. 
KYM (CONT'D) Anyhoo, as more of you know than are likely to admit, one of the actual steps is about making amends.

KYM (CONT'D) So I spent a lot of time calling up people who barely remembered me - who barely remembered anything - and apologizing to them for bouncing a check or passing out in the bathtub and flooding their house, or otherwise involving them in sordid activities they were desperately trying to forget. I had to call this one girl who was, I think, fourteen, but I couldn't talk to her because her Mom took out a restraining order. 
Kym thinks this is hysterical. Paul does not. 
KYM (CONT'D) Anyway, I did a lot of apologizing to people who were practically strangers so I very much want to take this opportunity to not only congratulate my extraordinary sister, the future explorer in matters of the mind, thank you very much, and her adorable, impending husband on the occasion of their unprecedented nuptials.. but also to apologize to my extraordinary sister, the future explorer in matters of the mind, for... Everything! And I really mean that, Rachel. I've been a nightmare and you've been a saint. I'm so damned glad I'm here with you and Sidney and his family and ours, and I am so happy for you guys, I really am. So, I am hereby raising my seltzer in celebration of my laudatory sister and herewith making amends. Sidney, you are robbing our dysfunctional family of one of it's most vital ingredients, and it's only member still willing to lend me money. (She pauses for a second) Enjoy Hawaii. La Chaim. 
She lifts her glass and downs it's contents. There is a smattering of applause. 
KYM (CONT'D) (to the group) One down. What's for dessert?

PAUL Rachel. She just got home. 
RACHEL Again. 
KYM I had no idea you were so angry, doctor. 
RACHEL I'm not. 
PAUL Kymmie, your sister's got a lot on her plate. She's uptight about... 
RACHEL I'm not uptight, Dad.

PAUL She's meeting Sidney's folks for the first time, there's menus, there's all that live music, you're home, there's a thousand things to worry about. 
CAROL Absolutely, a wedding will take it right out of you, boy. 
PAUL Yeah, it would be so lovely if we could all just... 
KYM (removing seeds) You people need to purge. You people really should go to Nar-Anon or something. I mean it. 
CAROL Oh my lord. Kym, we have gone through Nar-Anon, baby. You know that. 
RACHEL (turning her head) You people? You mean the people in this room? Your family? 
KYM All of you people living in this little world of judgement and paranoia and mistrust. I can feel it every second. At the slightest sign of ingratitude or absence of atonement it's like the freaking Salem Witch Trials around here. I might as well be... 
PAUL (pouncing) Don't even start... 
CAROL (standing next to her husband) Nobody can make you feel any way unless you let them, Kym. 
(CONTINUED) 
30   CONTINUED:                                               30 
KYM Thank you Carol, for your inevitable pearl of wisdom, but you people are my family. You people make me feel like shit a hundred times a day. You try living under Dad's constant monitoring for five minutes and see how you like it. 
PAUL What constant monitoring? 
KYM "I'll drive you!" "Carol, she's back!" "Don't sleep here, sleep there." "Here. Eat this." Dad, you're obsessed. 
RACHEL Please. That's hardly news. You may not know this...sure you do...the only way to engage Dad in any meaningful communication is to start the conversation with your name. "Have you heard from Kym? How's Kym?" It resuscitates him. It jars him into the moment. Like an alarm. 
PAUL That's unfair, Rachel. And completely untrue. 
RACHEL And she's even worse! "Dad, you're never going to believe this, but I lost the car again." "Dad, you're never going to believe this, but that check you sent me never showed up and my landlord hates me." "Dad, can somebody meet me downstairs with cab fare and you're never going to believe this but I need to go to the emergency room and my neighbor's suing me and my checkbook got stolen!" 
KYM Gee, Rach, sounds like you have some paternal/sibling issues to work through. 
(CONTINUED) 
30   CONTINUED:                                               30 
RACHEL Are you kidding? The two of you are like a double helix of crises. In the language of psychology one could say you both suffer from acute boundary issues. 
PAUL Rachel! It's nice that you're getting your Ph.D-- 
RACHEL (she throws up her hands.) --Oh god-- 
PAUL --but don't be patronizing. It's ugly. It doesn't become you. 
RACHEL How come she gets to spout off about paternal issues, but god forbid I should even reference the "boundary thing," even though I actually know what I'm talking about? 
KYM (waving her arms) Hello? By the way? I'm not in crisis. I haven't been in crisis for a year. 
RACHEL You just got out of rehab! 
30   CONTINUED:                                                30 
PAUL Kymmie, she's pregnant. She's exhausted. 
KYM Of course. Fair enough. I'm off to raid the medicine cabinet. 
Kym is gone. 
SIDNEY She's not serious? 
Everyone gathers around Rachel. 
CAROL Oh, Rachel darling, and Sidney, I couldn't be happier. 
SIDNEY She wasn't serious, was she? 
PAUL Do either of you want anything? A sandwich? You must be hungry. There's cold Saagwala and a little Aloo Gobi left over? 
RACHEL No thanks, Dad. I really am pretty sleepy. 
PAUL You're pretty everything! He mushes her face and kisses her cheek. Then he mushes Carol's face. 
CAROL Holy cow. What a day. I think I've aged. I mean it. (To Paul) ) Would you mind if I went to bed, darling? 
PAUL (kissing her again) Of course not. I'll be up, Carol. I'm just going to load the dishwasher. 
(CONTINUED)

Sidney intones the opening bars to Paul's heroic "DISHWASHER THEME". Paul raises the Cautionary Finger in Sidney's direction. Sidney stops with the music. 
CAROL Let me help, it'll be quicker. 
Now the Cautionary Finger is levelled at Carol. 
PAUL Don't mess with the King. 
CAROL Okay,okay. Hands in the air, Carol leaves the room. 
KIERAN Wow. That's it for me too, you guys. Good night everybody. Kieran lays a manly, buddy hug on Sidney. 
KIERAN Congratulations, man. 
SIDNEY Thanks, my friend. 
Kieran leaves. Now it's just Rachel, Paul and Sidney. Paul is beaming like a klieg light. 
RACHEL I've never been so tired in my life. 
Paul gives Rachel a kiss on the cheek and mushes her face some more. 
RACHEL Dad? 
PAUL Yes, sweetheart? 
RACHEL I hope it's okay, I told Mom at dinner. About the baby. 
PAUL Of course, lamb chop. I'm so happy! I'm going to be a grandpa!

RACHEL I'm not exactly sure what that means. 
ABBY Well, she needs a lot of acknowledgement. 
RACHEL You think? 
ABBY Stop. It can't be easy. Everybody knowing her troubles. 
RACHEL Mom, she's sold syndication rights to her troubles. 
ABBY Stop. 
RACHEL Mom, does it bother you at all, Carol doing so much wedding stuff? 
ABBY Not at all, darling, I'm thrilled to be providing the flowers. You know how much that means to me. They're going to be exquisite! 
RACHEL Yes, I'm sure, and that's so great and so you, but you can do whatever else you want, you know. I'd love it. 
ABBY Thank you, my sweetheart. I just know I'd be one of those wedding mothers who goes completely insane about the hors d'oeuvres. Andrew says I shouldn't be allowed near a shrimp puff. 
RACHEL Huh. 
ABBY There are so many other people for you to worry about.

RACHEL You're right. 
ABBY But this is going to be the most beautiful wedding ever. And I hope your sister has a wonderful time too...Anyway I'm going to be a grandmother! Hooray! 
RACHEL Hooray! 
ABBY I'm so excited. I have always wanted to be a grandmother. Even when I was thirty. Here. This ring was grandma's and she wanted you to have it. 
RACHEL Is she dead? 
ABBY Rachel. 
RACHEL It's beautiful. Thanks, Mom. I hope it's a boy. 
ABBY As long as it's healthy. Try the ring on. Rachel does. 
ABBY You've always had the most beautiful hands. 
36   EXT./INT. SCOTTY'S JAMAICAN RESTAURANT. DAY.              36 
A neighborhood place, but on the other side of the parkway from the Buchmans' neighborhood. Friendly, bustling, kids on bikes and skateboards, etc. Large windows offer a view of a stop sign, Fanny's Beauty Salon, Soul to Soul Liquor, a barber shop, etc.

36   CONTINUED:                                               36 
The restaurant is fluorescently lit, with a Jamaican flag on the wall and photos of Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, and Bob Marley. There is a counter at the front where you place your order and pick up your food. There is a Foosball table, and a pinball machine. 
Kym and Kieran are playing Foosball at the ancient table where someone has painted Jamaican jerseys on all the players. They are both viciously competitive and genuinely irritated with each other. 
KIERAN Your hand is on the turf. 
KYM What turf? 
KIERAN The turf. The table. 
Paul sits heavily. 
RACHEL They're your friends, Dad. 
PAUL They're not my friends. I've just known them my entire life. 
SIDNEY Just so you know, my mother expects to be carried in by liveried servants to the triumphant swirls of the harp and seated on a solid gold throne forged by nuns. 
RACHEL Really? Because right now I have her shoveling kelp in the laundry room. But I have it as a montage. Kieran and Kym arrive on the porch. Kym settles herself on a big comfy chaise. 
KYM Where are you putting me? In the stockade? 
PAUL Kym, stop it. You're at the family table. 
Kym turns her face to the sun, shutting her eyes. 
KYM (heedless) Don't put me with Michael and Sandy.

KYM Sandy never called me back after I sent her an amends e-mail from Milestones. I hate it when people don't meet you half way. 
PAUL The family table. With us. 
CLOSE ON SEATING PLACEMENT BOARD-- Paul moves Kym's "marker" -- the MONOPOLY DOG -- to the family table. 
WIDER-- 
EMMA Oops. That's nine. I thought you were having tables of eight? 
RACHEL (pointedly) I am. 
KYM (to anyone, her eyes still closed) Where are you putting me? 
RACHEL I was thinking of putting you with Cookie Puss and the Chicago cousins because they always get really drunk and need wrangling. 
KYM Can someone else do it? I was planning on enjoying myself. 
RACHEL You're the only one they're afraid of. 
KYM Still? God. 
Rachel pushes the MONOPOLY DOG to a different table.

PAUL (not getting it) We can move Grandma Rose and her companion. That's actually a great idea. 
Kym opens one eye and sees Paul switch markers -- the MONOPOLY DOG is back at the FAMILY TABLE. Rachel stares at her father. 
KYM That's all I need. Another reason for Grandma Rose to hate me. 
PAUL She doesn't hate you. 
KYM She's still mad about that thing at the Rite Aid. 
PAUL Nonsense! 
CAROL Ha! 
SIDNEY You see Paul, I think your problem lies in lid placement.

PAUL Rachel, you're out of the will. 
SIDNEY Observe. 
With a flourish, Sidney presents a beautifully stacked dishwasher. Paul pats his shoulder somberly. 
PAUL Clean out this machine please, boy. So I can break out the whup-ass. 
Screaming all around. Kym jumps up and down with her arms on Rachel's shoulders. Rachel glances at her sister, laughing. 
SIDNEY/KIERAN (delightedly) He's breakin' out the whup ass! 
A SWEET MONTAGE. 
Paul is loading the dishwasher like a champ. Carol and Emma are smiling and giggling. 
Kieran has his eye on the clock. Sidney trash talks from the sidelines. 
SIDNEY You know one of the early signs of senile dementia is an obsessive need to organize. 
PAUL Rachel, go fetch me my dart gun. 
SIDNEY I find it touching but ultimately sad when the warriors of yesteryear are reluctant to lay down their plastic containers from Zabar's and retire gracefully. 
PAUL Kieran, how's my time?

KIERAN You have twenty-five seconds. 
PAUL I need more dishes. You amateur! 
SIDNEY What? No way! 
PAUL Somebody give me some dishes! Kym yanks open a cupboard and passes a handful of dishes to Paul. He begins to load them. 
CLOSE ON PAUL He has a bowl in his hands. We see the bowl is a plastic child's bowl with Engines and Cabooses all over it. Paul turns the bowl around in his hands like a steering wheel. 
It dawns on Kym that she's handed her father Ethan's bowl. She is stricken. Paul looks to Carol. He seems bewildered. The kitchen falls silent and Carol takes Ethan's bowl and places it in the sink, out of sight. She leads Paul gently out of the kitchen. 
CLOSE ON KYM -- 
CLOSE ON RACHEL -- She turns and leaves the kitchen. Sidney follows her. Emma and Norman Sklear step out onto the porch. Kieran takes the Ethan bowl from the sink and puts it quietly back in the cupboard and shuts the door. Kym doesn't know what to do.

Rachel is driving, Kym is in the passenger seat. The radio is on and neither says anything. Kym cranks down the window, tries to light a cigarette. 
KYM Mom is handling the flowers? 
RACHEL Well, she's growing them and choosing them - but they are being delivered by her people. 
KYM Got it. Wow. Nurturing and growing things from the soil. Textbook, right? 
PAUL It was an accident. 
KYM Yes! I was stoned out of my mind! Jesus Christ, who do I have to be now? Mother Theresa? Did I use up all the love I'm allowed for this lifetime because I killed our little brother? 
PAUL No, it was an accident! 
KYM I'm sorry! I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry! 
Paul bursts out weeping. 
PAUL It was an accident. Kym, her hair still in foils, rushes out of the house. 
Carol turns to Rachel. Rachel bolts upstairs. Carol turns to Paul. Paul waves her away. Carol is bawling too.

INTERCUT the conversation: 
ABBY Hello Paul. 
PAUL Is Kym with you? 
ABBY No. Why? Did she go somewhere? 
PAUL She left the house about an hour ago. 
ABBY To a meeting? 
PAUL She and Rachel had an argument. 
ABBY Oh, dear. The night before her wedding? What was it about? 
PAUL Look, Abby, it doesn't matter. She left the house. She took the car. 
ABBY What was the argument about? 
PAUL I don't know. They were both getting their hair done...

PAUL For god's sake Abby! I'm trying to figure out where she went before I call the police! 
ABBY Well, last time you called the police looking for her she was upstairs, asleep in the guest room. 
PAUL She wasn't asleep, she was unconscious! And I'm glad I called the police because it took twenty minutes to wake her up and at least something was being done! 
ABBY Paul, I'm trying to help. 
PAUL You're trying to dismiss everything! 
ABBY She's not a criminal!

Kieran, looking drawn under the fluorescent lights, stands inside the Jamaican restaurant staring out at the night. 
THROUGH THE WINDOW a beat up WHITE HONDA tears ass right through the stop sign and screeches on up the road. Kieran flinches.

KYM Ahhh.... 
ABBY You should call your father. 
The air seems to go out of Kym for a moment. 
KYM In a minute. I need a glass of water. 
ABBY I've made some tea. 
Abby picks up the tray, leading the way from the kitchen into the living room. Trailing behind her, Kym looks around her mother's unfamiliar house -- the spaciousness and stark modernity of Andrew's house stand in marked contrast to the rampant folksy-ness of the Buchman house.

Abby places the tea service on a low table in front of a sprawling sofa in the stone-walled living room. 
ABBY Here darling. Sit down. You look upset. 
Kym sits, pours and sips. Abby remains standing and tightens the belt of her bathrobe. 
KYM When will Andrew be back? 
ABBY Not too late. He's at a dinner. 
Beat. 
ABBY I spoke to grandma today. She sends her love. Is everything all right with the wedding? 
KYM Yes. 
ABBY Good. 
KYM Dad was loading the dishwasher... 
ABBY Mmm hmmm... 
KYM And I handed him Ethan's bowl with the trains on it by accident. 
Kym begins to weep. Abby remains still. Kym's weeping becomes louder and louder. She is having trouble breathing. Just as Abby reaches out to touch her... 
KYM Why did you leave me in charge of him? Abby stops.

NOW -- The cop is studying Kym's license and registration. NOW -- An AMBULANCE has arrived. Red lights flashing. 
The crowd of onlookers has swelled considerably. 
NOW -- The cop gives a clearly upset Kym a Breathalyzer test as PARAMEDICS wrap a pressure cuff around her arm -- she exhales into the Breathalyzer tube, her eyes darting between the cop, the cracked windshield of the car and the gawking crowd up on the road. 
TIME CUT -- The paramedic holds Kym firmly by the chin and peers deeply into her right eye. The other paramedic blots at Kym's swollen lip with a gauze and hands her an ice pack. 
TIME CUT -- The cop gives Kym her license and hands her an official looking form, which she stuffs in her shoulder bag. 
64   EXT. THE BUCHMAN HOUSE. DAY.                                 64 
A truck towing the beat-up station wagon comes to a halt in the street in front of the Buchman house. Kym steps down from the passenger seat, ignoring whatever the driver just said in parting. The house is festooned with peonies and lights and WORKERS hurrying about. Everything looks absolutely beautiful. CATERERS are running from their vans into the house with armloads of food, drinks, etc. Abby's flowers are being unloaded from another van. Decorative chandeliers are being carried inside. VALETS are setting up their car-parking operation (a decorated picnic table) at the foot of the driveway. 
Kym squares her shoulders and begins her long walk up to the Buchman house, back into the chaos. A CUTE VALET passes Kym on the lawn, carrying two paper cups of coffee, dressed in an Indian military tunic. He takes in Kym's disheveled and bruised appearance. 
VALET Um. Hi. 
KYM I'm the Maid of Honor.

VALET Hey, I know you. I used to work at the dog grooming place. 
Kym keeps walking, ignoring him. 
VALET Hey, you holding? 
Paul and Carol, beautifully dressed, appear on the front porch and hurry towards Kym. 
PAUL Kymmie? 
CAROL Oh my lord... 
PAUL Are you all right? They meet at the circular driveway. 
KYM I hit Mom. 
PAUL Oh my god is she... 
KYM Not with the car.

He tries to touch her. She stops his hand. Paul backs off. 
PAUL You can't just vanish. You can't just leave. You have to call. You always have to call. 
Rachel dabs gently at Kym's face with a washcloth while Kym scrubs at her nails with a brush. 
She glides the soapy washcloth over Kym's back. She notices the word ethan inscribed within the design of the rose and thorns image tattooed on Kym's left shoulder. 
Rachel rinses shampoo and leaves and dirt out of her sister's hair while Kym brushes her teeth. 
Rachel dabs makeup on Kym's chin as Kym's hands tremble with the mascara. 
RACHEL I got it.

A canopy of cherry blossoms leads from the living room terrace to the opened living room doors. Sidney, looking stunning in a dove grey Nehru suit and a lavender pocket square, waits at the altar with groomsmen Kieran, Norman Sklear, and Cousin Joseph (now wearing full dress U.S. Army uniform)... and officiating JUDGE CASTLE. 
SFX: LIVE MUSIC -- "Here Comes The Bride" on distant electric guitar and drums plus foreground violin and gently chanted "Rachel's" and "Sidney's" by the assembled friends. Emma's smiling face fills the frame as the ceremony begins. Bridesmaids Emma, Kayra Williams, Victoria, and - -

Kym in her dress with her striped hair, split lip and black eye, trying to find her game face. The wedding guests are slack-jawed. Mrs. Williams (Sidney's mom) looks like she's passing a stone. 
Abby stands quietly with Andrew in the first row. She looks composed and lovely and has the tiniest hint of a bruise on her chin. The procession reaches the altar and the wedding party turns to face Rachel and Paul. Paul is beaming, walking his beautiful daughter from the side of the house and across the terrace to the living room. She glows in her white and gold Sari. 
They reach the altar of blossoms. Rachel kisses her dad's cheek and he hugs her. Things are set up so that Rachel and Sidney stand just inside the living room, facing the beautiful backyard. Kym reaches for Rachel's bouquet but Rachel has handed it to Emma by reflex. Kym tries to cover her gesture. Rachel and Sidney join hands. 
JUDGE CASTLE We're here on this beautiful day... 
Somebody's baby starts to cry. 
JUDGE CASTLE Exactly. Everybody cracks up, especially Kym. She laughs a beat longer than anybody else.

Rachel is crying. Sidney takes his pocket square and carefully dries her tears. 
Abby is drying her own eyes. 
Rachel makes her own declaration to Sidney. Norman Sklear hands Sidney an acoustic guitar and Sidney strums it and plucks a delicate melody. 
SIDNEY For you. (to Rachel's stomach) And you...ahem... (sings) 
"She used to work in a diner Never saw a woman look finer I used to order just to watch her float across the floor She grew up in a small town Never put her roots down Daddy always kept movin', so she did too.

EVERYONE La Chaim. Rachel suddenly stands on a chair and bangs on a glass with a spoon. 
RACHEL Friends and family, family and friends! I have an announcement to make! I'm the bride and I'm knocked up! Surprised whooping and hollering. 
RACHEL I'm exercising my bridely, knocked up prerogatives and demand that 
everybody starts dancing. And this means you too, Mom! Abby smiles. SFX: The Deejay spins an infectious platter (TBD). 
RACHEL Oh yay! Dad c'mon. C'mon Dad! This is my favorite song! 
PAUL Ooo. Look at me, I'm dancing. She drags Paul to the temporary poolside patio dance floor. Paul is a fantastic dancer! Sidney drags his dad to the dance floor. He's dramatic and weird! Abby smiles politely at Kym and goes to sit down with Andrew. Kieran spirits Kym to the patio, where they join the dancers.

Inside the tent, yet another group of musician friends are currently laying down an evocative, hypnotic and extremely cool, jazzy "world music" groove as the same attractive and immaculate young servers (from the rehearsal dinner) circulate with trays of delicious appetizers, wine, seltzer, etc. 
Kym is still wearing her sari. She stands next to her mother. They are doing their wedding party duties. Neither woman is looking at the other.

The dancers are oblivious to Kym's presence. 
KYM (to Rachel) Hi. Where's Mom? 
Rachel has her head on Sidney's shoulder, her eyes closed. 
RACHEL Taking a break. 
KYM How can you take a break from your own daughter's wedding? 
RACHEL Mom doesn't actually participate in things. 
KYM And anyway, she hasn't even done anything all day. 
RACHEL I was thinking about getting her a cat. Cats are really annoying. At some point you have to deal with them, right? Or they starve to death and piss on your sheets. 
KYM It's so nice here. Suddenly Kieran sweeps into the room. 
KIERAN You can run but you can't hide! Kym shrieks as Kieran grabs her and plants a wet one on her, dipping her to the floor. They careen into Sidney and Rachel. Sidney grabs Rachel and starts molesting her.

Andrew pops his head in. 
ANDREW They're bringing the car around.

ABBY Darling, I'm exhausted. I had such a marvelous time. Those dancers were so beautiful. But weddings are really for young people. 
PAUL Susanna has a public relations firm and she just lost one of her assistants. 
SUSANNA Weddings. They're an epidemic. Your father gave me my start about a hundred years ago. 
PAUL No, no. Hardly. Well... 
SUSANNA We could definitely use an extra body right about now. Have you ever thought about Public Relations? 
KYM The public is kind of afraid of me. 
Susanna and Paul laugh. 
PAUL The firm is opening an office right here in town, just in time for the holidays. You could stay right here. 
SUSANNA Have you ever thought about P.R. Kym?

SUSANNA Goodbye Paul. It was just beautiful. Bye Kym. She leaves.

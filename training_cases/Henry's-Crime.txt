HENRY'S CRIME 
Written by 
Sacha Gervasi 
INT. TOLL BOOTH - DAWN 
A LONE TOLL BOOTH ATTENDANT sits inside his glass box on an empty stretch of interstate. This is HENRY. He looks out at the horizon. It's starting to get light out. There's snow on the ground. He's neither asleep nor awake. 
INT. TOLL BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER 
HENRY'S PLASTIC GLOVES unscrew a THERMOS, pour coffee into a Styrofoam cup. There are only a few drops left. 
A CAR Approaches. Henry straightens, slides open his window. But the CAR veers over to the automated EZ-PASS LANE... Henry closes the window, watches the car disappear. He downs the last of his coffee, looks back out at the horizon again. It's cloudy out there. 
A CLOCK flips to 6:00. 
INT. TOLL BOOTH - LATER 
Henry packs up his thermos, puts on his coat and steps out into the icy morning. He walks toward his truck. The traffic is beginning to build. 
EXT. BUFFALO STREET - MORNING 
Henry's old FORD PICK-UP drives past the enormous, abandoned CENTRAL TRAIN TERMINAL. 
EXT. BUFFALO STREET - MORNING 
The pick-up turns down toward a neighborhood of modest salt-box houses. 
EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MORNING 
Henry's truck rolls into his driveway. 
INT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
Henry enters. Hangs up his down jacket on a row of hooks. It's clean and ordinary in here. His wife, DEBBIE, is in the kitchen. She's wearing a NURSES uniform. Henry notices the dining room table set for one for breakfast. Eggs, bacon, sausage. He's a little surprised. Debbie appears. Lays down the toast. 
HENRY Smells good. 
DEBBIE Sit down. He sits. She smiles. Starts buttering the toast. 
HENRY Wow. Thanks. He digs in. 
DEBBIE How was your night? 
HENRY Good. How was yours? She's still buttering the toast. Carefully. 
DEBBIE Good. She sets it down. 
HENRY This is great. She sits down next to him. Watches him eat. 
HENRY (CONT'D) Your shift's at eight thirty? She nods. 
HENRY (CONT'D) You not eating? 
DEBBIE I already did. He takes another bite. 
HENRY You okay? 
Pause. 
DEBBIE Are you coming with me to Cindy and Bill's on Saturday? 
HENRY Sure. What time? Pause. 
DEBBIE For the baby shower. 
HENRY Right. She just stares at him... 
DEBBIE Well, I don't want to go to Cindy and Bill's. 
HENRY What? 
DEBBIE I mean I want Cindy and Bill to come here. 
HENRY Cindy and Bill are welcome here anytime. Pause. 
DEBBIE Henry. Isn't it time...isn't it time for us? Henry stops eating. 
HENRY You're talking about kids. 
DEBBIE Of course I am. 
HENRY Okay. 
DEBBIE 'Okay' you want kids? Pause. 
INT. PRISON TIER - NIGHT 
One by one we see lights blinking off across the vast string of cells. 
FADE OUT : 
INT. VISITING AREA - DAY 
Henry's wife Debbie sits at one of the metal visiting tables. She's dressed up. She's really made an effort. A door opens, Henry appears. He looks different. Some time has passed. He smiles, walks over. Then sits. 
DEBBIE Hi. 
HENRY Hi. You look beautiful. 
DEBBIE Thank you. How are you doing? 
HENRY I'm okay. How about you? 
DEBBIE I'm good. A beat. 
DEBBIE (CONT'D) Listen, Henry. I have something I need to talk to you about. 
HENRY Okay. 
DEBBIE I fell in love. Henry takes that in. 
HENRY Oh. Pause. 
DEBBIE I just...I mean it just happened. Pause. 
HENRY Okay. Wow... 
DEBBIE I'm sorry, Henry. 
HENRY It's alright. 
DEBBIE You're not mad? He thinks. 
HENRY No. He looks at her. 
HENRY (CONT'D) I want you to be happy. 
DEBBIE You too, Henry. No one moves. 
EXT. PRISON YARD - LATER THAT DAY 
Henry sits on a bench alone, processing what just happened. He looks up at the sky. Gray and empty. Max arrives, sits down next to Henry, carefully puts a hand around his shoulder. 
MAX I ever tell you I was married? Henry turns to him. 
MAX (CONT'D) I mean nearly. I had a lovely correspondence going with Jocelyn Steinberg in Utica. Problem was when she finally came on visitor's day she said I was too short. Henry thinks. 
HENRY Books and covers. 
MAX Right. Books and covers. 
CUT TO: 
TWO YEARS LATER 
INT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - DAY 
There's music on a radio. Pull back to reveal Henry sitting on his bunk. He's grown a beard. Their cell has temporarily been converted into a makeshift BARBERSHOP. CONVICTS of various races wait to get their hair cut by Max the Barber. Max holds up a mirror to his customer, FINK. 
MAX Clean as a whistle. 
FINK (checking himself out) Max, I think you missed your calling. 
MAX Thank you. 
(THEN) Who do we got next, Henry? Henry checks the schedule by his side, calls out a name. 
HENRY Hector. You're up. Standing just outside, A GUARD watches the make-shift barbershop carefully. Hector takes his seat. Max wraps a sheet around his neck. 
HECTOR Hey, Max. When are you up for parole? 
MAX October. 
HECTOR Show us what you did for the board last time. 
MAX I'm working. The other INMATES egg him on. 
OTHER INMATES Show us! 
MAX Leave me alone. 
INMATES Come on! Show us. Max finally puts his clippers down. 
MAX Get out of here, Henry. 
EXT. PRISON - DAY 
It's cloudy. Henry walks through the front GATE of the prison. He takes a long deep breath of free air. It's cold. We see his exhale. He starts to walk. 
INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY 
Henry sits in the back of the bus, the New York countryside streaking past him in a blur... 
EXT. BUFFALO STREET - DAY 
Henry turns onto his old street. 
EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - DAY 
Henry walks up to his doorway. He hesitates before ringing the bell. A beat. The door opens. It's -- 
JOE The guy who got sick several years before. He's wearing a suit and tie now. 
JOE Henry. How you doing? 
HENRY Hey. 
JOE 
(CALLING OUT) Debbie! Henry's here. 
(TO HENRY) Come on in. Make yourself at home. 
HENRY Thanks. 
INT. HENRY'S OLD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Henry enters. His old house looks more or less the same. Joe heads over to small display of KITCHENWARE SAMPLES in the living room. 
JOE Don't mind me. I'm just getting set up for my meeting. You want a beer? 
HENRY Sure. 
JOE 
(CALLING OUT) Honey, do mind getting Henry a beer? 
As Joe clips several FLOW CHARTS onto an easel -- they look like they were done by a kid -- Debbie appears with a Bud Lite. She hands it to Henry. She smiles. 
DEBBIE Hi. 
HENRY Hi. It's not so awkward. 
INT. GARAGE - MINUTES LATER 
Debbie leads Henry to a NAVY BAG and a BOX with Henry's name on it. 
DEBBIE I think that's everything you wanted. 
HENRY Thanks. A beat. They just stand there for a moment. 
HENRY (CONT'D) Are you happy? 
DEBBIE I am, Henry. 
HENRY I'm glad. He means it. Henry picks up the box, shoulders the bag. 
DEBBIE So what are you going to do now? 
HENRY I don't know yet. Joe enters. 
JOE Honey, they're starting to arrive. Joe grabs a DISPLAY STAND featuring kitchen products. 
DEBBIE 
(TO HENRY) We're having a meeting. It's his new business. 
JOE Hey, maybe you'd be interested, Henry. You could become a distributor for Jin Chi. They all head out of the garage. 
JOE (CONT'D) It's Korean kitchenware. The future of food storage. Plus, if you recruit distributors, you get paid even more. Passing through the living room arriving GUESTS notice Henry walking out carrying his box. 
HENRY You mean like a pyramid scheme? 
JOE No! God, no. It's a multi-layered marketing paradigm. 
(HENRY'S LOOK) Anyway, why don't you give it some thought? Henry nods, starts to head out. 
JOE (CONT'D) Henry. 
HENRY Yeah? 
HENRY It does? 
FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER Henry, You've done your time. You are now a free free man. 
(THEN) How does it feel? Henry takes a breath. 
HENRY Good. 
She signs a document and hands it to him. 
FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER So, What's next? Henry doesn't answer. The SOUND of boots, move in on HENRY'S EXPRESSION, staring, as we 
CUT TO : 
HENRY'S DIRTY BOOTS march along the street with purpose... We follow them. After a while, the boots stop. 
EXT. MAIN ST. BUFFALO - DAY 
HENRY looks up : we travel around him, see what he sees : 
THE FIRST BUFFALO BANK Directly across the street. Holding on Henry as he contemplates the place... Henry takes a deep breath. Focuses in. There's something happening, he's not sure what it is...an idea perhaps, an instinct that somehow with each passing moment becomes more like a knowing.... A moment of revelation. He starts across the street toward the bank, moving now, heading right toward the front door, transfixed, as the SOUND DROPS out and he begins to smile -- 
SCREEEECH! A car HITS Henry in the side. He's knocked down. A GIRL (30s) Rushes out of the car. 
JULIE What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Are you okay? (into cell phone) Stan. I gotta call you back! I just ran someone over. No, he looks okay. 
She hangs up. 
JULIE (CONT'D) You idiot, you weren't even looking where you were going! Are you okay? Henry's a little delirious. 
HENRY I think I'm okay. He grabs his thigh. Winces with pain. Tries to get up. 
JULIE No. Stay on the ground. The bank Guard FRANK rushes over. 
FRANK Is he alright? Don't get up. I'll call an ambulance. 
HENRY No, don't. (Starts to stand) I think I'm okay. 
FRANK 
(RECOGNIZING HIM) You! 
HENRY 
(RECOGNIZING HIM) Yeah. Me. 
JULIE (to Frank, confused) Is he alright? 
FRANK Are you alright? 
HENRY Yeah. Fine. 
JULIE He just walked right out into the street. He came out of nowhere. 
FRANK I saw the whole thing. You were on the phone. You weren't even paying attention. 
JULIE Yes. I was. I know how to drive. Cars are honking now as Henry limps his way over to the sidewalk. 
JULIE (CONT'D) What are you doing? Get back on the ground! 
FRANK Park your car. I'm going to take him into that cafe. She jumps back in her car and pulls it over to the side. Frank comes over to Henry, takes his arm. 
FRANK (CONT'D) They let you out, huh. 
HENRY Yeah. 
FRANK Let's get you a seat in here. 
INT. ORPHEUM CAFE - CONTINUOUS 
Frank sets Henry down in a chair at one of the tables by the door. 
FRANK Pierre! Une Verre d'eau. 
HENRY Thanks. Julie comes in. 
JULIE Did you call an ambulance? I'm calling an ambulance. 
HENRY It's okay. I really am fine. 
FRANK Yeah. He's alright for a guy who just got run over. (sucks his teeth) Lucky I guess. Frank leaves. 
JULIE I think we should call a doctor. Henry just stares at her. For a long moment. 
JULIE (CONT'D) What? Are you okay? He keeps staring... 
JULIE (CONT'D) Hello, guy? Are you okay? Do you need a doctor? A beat. 
MAX What? 
HENRY My destiny. 
MAX Good. What is it? A beat. Henry leans in. 
HENRY The bank. 
MAX The bank is your destiny? 
HENRY Yeah. 
MAX What bank? 
HENRY The one I didn't rob. Pause. 
MAX But you went to jail for it. 
HENRY Exactly. 
MAX What are you talking about Henry? Henry looks around. Closer -- 
HENRY I did the time, I may as well have done the crime. 
MAX Ah, that. Time. Crime. Right. 
(THEN) I still don't get it. Pause. 
HENRY I need your help. 
MAX What for? 
HENRY 
(A WHISPER) To rob the bank. Pause. 
HENRY (CONT'D) So what do you say? 
MAX I'm in Jail. That's what I say. 
HENRY You've got your review coming up -- 
MAX -- So? 
HENRY So you can get of here. If you want to. 
MAX No. It's not as simple as that. 
HENRY Yes, it is. 
MAX No, it's not. 
HENRY Yes. It is. 
MAX No, it's not. 
HENRY 
MAX -- 
MAX I'm happy here. This is my home. 
HENRY This is not a home. This is a prison. 
MAX Whatever you want to call it, I'm happy here. A beat. Henry looks at Max now. He looks frail. 
HENRY Max. You can't die in this place. 
MAX I can die wherever I want. 
HENRY You really want to die here? 
MAX What do you want, Henry? 
HENRY I'm asking for your help. 
MAX To rob that bank?! 
HENRY I've thought about it. It's the right thing. 
(THEN) For both of us. A long beat. Max gets up : 
MAX Henry. I got cards. 
HENRY 
MAX -- 
Henry catches up. She crosses the street, ignoring the traffic. Henry follows. 
HENRY Is it always like that? 
JULIE What? 
HENRY (gesturing back to the 
THEATRE) That. 
JULIE You mean rehearsal? 
HENRY Yeah. 
JULIE It's a process. 
HENRY Looks complicated. 
JULIE It's all pain. 
(THEN) Chekhov, right? They reach the Cafe. He opens the door for her : 
HENRY I thought you were listening. She looks at him, curiously. 
HENRY (CONT'D) I'm Henry by the way. 
JULIE Julie. 
INT. CAFE ORPHEUM - DAY 
They enter. It's busy. 
PIERRE Madame Julie! 
JULIE Coffee, Pierre. She points at Henry. 
JULIE (CONT'D) You want one? 
HENRY Sure. 
SHE SIGNALS : 
JULIE Two. They stand right there at the bar. Silence. Henry notices the play poster on the wall over her shoulder. Looks at it. Then back at her. Comparing her photo to the live person. 
JULIE (CONT'D) What? She turns to see what he's looking at. A beat. 
JULIE (CONT'D) So what do you think? 
HENRY Doesn't look like you. 
JULIE No, I meant the poster. 
HENRY Oh. It's funny. 
JULIE Actors on a tree is funny? 
HENRY Yeah. She smiles. Pierre puts the coffees down on the bar. 
JULIE That's the director's joke. She starts dropping cubes of sugar in her cup. 
JULIE (CONT'D) He's making a comment on the American culture. Actors faces as falling fruit. Birth, death, the consumption of the ID. Henry's interested. 
JULIE (CONT'D) To him, the American dream has become the world's nightmare. "You are the country of apocalypse." 
(THEN ) That's what he told us on the first day of rehearsal, anyway. 
HENRY Oh. 
JULIE The irony is, he loves the American dream. I mean that's why he's here, right? 
(WHISPERS) But I know for a fact he hates himself for loving it. It's always an inside job, isn't it? 
HENRY Yeah. I guess. Pause. 
JULIE But the truth is I wasn't listening. I was playing it safe. 
(THEN) He was right. The jerk. About that, anyway... She drinks her coffee. 
JULIE (CONT'D) You know the Cherry Orchard was Chekhov's last play. He was dying when he wrote it. She thinks. He listens. 
JULIE (CONT'D) It's perfect. 
HENRY Why? 
JULIE (CONT'D It's my last play too. Here in Buffalo. 
HENRY You're leaving? She downs the last of her coffee. 
MAX (nearly on his knees) I'm going to die right here. I told you! 
HENRY Come on, Max, we're going to miss that bus. Henry helps Max back up again. 
EXT. BUS - DAY 
A GREYHOUND BUS rumbles through the countryside. 
INT. BUS - DAY 
Henry and Max sit up front right next to the driver. Max has his eyes closed. He still looks woozy. 
HENRY You hungry? He opens his bag and pulls out a sandwich. Offers it to him. Max doesn't say anything. 
HENRY (CONT'D) It's pastrami. On rye. A beat. Max opens one eye... 
A KEY GOING INTO A LOCK... 
INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Henry opens the door for Max. They enter. 
HENRY Here we are. Henry indicates the tiny bed in the corner of the living room. There are some second hand books on the bedside table like `Future Shock' by Alvin Toffler and Dostoyevsky. 
HENRY (CONT'D) That one's yours. 
Max goes over, looks at the books. Sits down on the bed. 
MAX Thanks. 
HENRY Anything else you need? A beat. 
MAX Yeah. 
INT. HENRY'S BATHROOM - LATER 
Max reclines in the steaming TUB, luxuriating in the warm water. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and relaxes. After a moment he notices a fancy-looking bottle on the side. 
MAX (reads the label) Ah. The land of milk and honey. Pours it into his bath. 
EXT. BUFFALO STREET - DAY 
As they cross a street, Max notices a coffee shop on the other side. 
MAX What is this obsession with coffee, Henry? When did that happen? 
HENRY I'm not sure, Max. But it seems to give people a lot of purpose. They walk into the Cafe Orpheum. 
INT. CAFE ORPHEUM, BATHROOM -- DAY 
THE PROHIBITION-ERA PHOTO Henry looked at earlier when he was pissing. Max is staring at the thing now too... 
MAX Oh my God. Are you kidding? This was eighty years ago. It's ridiculous. Oh my God. That tunnel's probably not even there anymore! Are you dreaming, Henry? 
HENRY It's a start. 
MAX A start? This was your plan? An old cartoon in a pissoir? 
HENRY It's an article. 
MAX Whatever, Henry. Why don't we just go in with guns and do it the old-fashioned way? 
HENRY No. No guns. 
MAX What? 
HENRY Someone could get hurt. Pause. 
MAX That's sweet, kid. 
HENRY (the tunnel photo) Maybe it's still there, Max. A beat. 
MAX 
(SURE) Uh-huh. 
HENRY Maybe it is. Max looks at him. 
MAX Right. Okay. Yes. First things first. Why don't we go take a look at this bank of yours? 
(THEN) At least we know that's still there. Henry looks at him. 
INT. FIRST BUFFALO BANK - DAY 
Max and Henry walk in to the grand banking hall. 
MAX Money is a mistress with a hard heart. 
JULIE Oh. 
MAX Henry, let's get out of these people's way! Henry turns to Julie. 
HENRY 
(TO JULIE) What are you doing after rehearsal? 
JULIE Why? 
HENRY Do you like Chinese? 
JULIE Yeah. 
HENRY Golden Dragon? 
JULIE It's okay. 
HENRY Eight o'clock? 
SHE DECIDES : 
JULIE Sure. They look at each other as ACTORS return to the stage. DAREK moves towards his place in the front seats. 
DAREK Work. Work! It's time to work Americans! 
(SEES HER) Even you Djula... Max grabs Henry -- 
MAX Let's go. 
HENRY See you, Julie. 
JULIE Stay out of jail. Henry waves. 
EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER 
Max and Henry exit the back stage doors. 
MAX You were right, Henry. You got a nose like a bloodhound! 
HENRY You found it? 
MAX Yeah. Right there. In Lophakin's dressing room. 
HENRY Who? 
MAX Lophakin. We find a way to get into his dressing room and we're right as rain! Henry and Max notice FRANK standing at the corner of the alley having a cigarette. He glares at them as they pass... 
INT. APARTMENT, BATHROOM - LATER 
Henry gets ready for his date. Max keeps talking, sitting on the side of the tub as he draws the bath... 
MAX I can see it, Henry. It's all in front of me. The vault. The bank. The tunnel. The pieces of the puzzle are on the table. All we got to do is put them in the right order! 
(THEN) The only thing is the dirt...where does the dirt from the tunnel go? 
HENRY What about the vault? 
MAX First things first. I'm on the dirt. 
HENRY Okay. How do I look? 
MAX Like Henry. 
(THEN) We had a good day, Kid. It's good to be back in the soup. 
(MORE) 
MAX (CONT'D) (he starts to take off his 
CLOTHES) Go have a nice supper. 
A CHOPSTICK Henry places it between a PLATE and a NAPKIN, linking them together like...a tunnel... 
INT. GOLDEN DRAGON - RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Henry waits for Julie. He's all cleaned up. Fresh shirt. 
JULIE Sorry I'm late. I'm starving. She sits. Looks at the menu. A GUY who's leaving, sees her : 
GUY Julie. 
JULIE Bruce. The guy glances at Henry. Leaves. 
JULIE (CONT'D) That guy's a total dick. Hi, Henry. She studies the menu. 
HENRY Hi. How was rehearsal? She puts it down. No answer. 
JULIE So what were you in prison for, Max? Max slurps his coffee. 
MAX I'm a confidence man. 
JULIE You mean a `con' man? 
MAX I never liked that word. It's only half of what it is. The word confidence comes from the latin. Fides. With Faith. Belief. 
(THEN) That's what I'm about. She considers this. 
JULIE You mean you make people feel good...and then you rip them off? 
MAX Yes. He glances at Henry. 
MAX (CONT'D) But I was always much better at the feeling good part than the ripping off part. 
(THEN) Hence, the prison. 
JULIE Aren't you guys worried about getting caught? 
MAX Not really. For me it's a win-win situation. 
JULIE How? 
MAX I like jail. Three hots and a cot. Julie looks at Henry now... 
JULIE You too, Henry? You like jail? 
HENRY No. I like it out here. 
JULIE So why would you take the risk? Is it the money? Henry doesn't answer, starts to collect the plates. 
JULIE (CONT'D) It must be the money. Henry smiles. 
JULIE (CONT'D) You are a criminal. A greedy little criminal. 
HENRY (washing the plates) `Your brother Leonid says I'm an upstart, a money grubber... 
(THEN) ...but I don't care a bit'. He turns to her. 
HENRY (CONT'D) `I just want you to believe in me like the old days.' 
JULIE You remember! 
MAX What is that? 
JULIE It's Chekhov! 
MAX Chekhov?! 
HENRY We read it last night. 
JULIE 
(TO HENRY) You really are good. 
(TO MAX) He's a natural. 
MAX I thought you were on a date. 
HENRY We were. 
MAX Reading Chekhov's a date? Beat. 
HENRY Yeah. She downs her coffee. Stands. 
JULIE I got to get to the theatre -- 
MAX Can you give me a ride there? 
JULIE Why? 
MAX I'm a volunteer! She regards him a moment. 
JULIE You weren't in any of those plays, were you? 
MAX No. 
(THEN) But can you give me a ride? 
INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - DAY 
Julie as Madame Ranevsky. Her brother GAYEV and her daughter VARYA are also on stage. 
JULIE All white! All White! Oh, my Cherry Orchard. After the dark, stormy autumn and the winter frosts you are young again and full of happiness; the heavenly angels have never abandoned you... 
(MORE) 
ARNOLD You knew this day would come. You deserve this, lubya. He closes his eyes. Bows his head. Starts to weep... 
INT. THEATRE - MORNING 
CLOSE ON DAREK : the veins on the side of his forehead pulsate with rage... 
DAREK Unprofessional shit! 
ARNOLD Mr. Millodragovich -- 
DAREK 
(HISSING) Shit! 
INT. THEATRE - MORNING 
Julie stands in the wings. Max joins her. 
MAX What's happening? 
JULIE Arnold's leaving the production. 
MAX Oh. Gosh. 
DAREK AND ARNOLD on the stage. Simon behind them. Darek is right in 
ARNOLD'S FACE : 
ARNOLD But I have no choice it's Willie Lohman we're talking about! (brandishing the letter) A Ken Waterstone production! 
DAREK OOOH-LA-LA! A Ken Waterstone production. The heaven's have opened. You lucky boy. 
(MORE) 
DAREK (CONT'D) Run, run, to that pandering, populist, piece-of-shit-Waterstone and his spineless productions! You're perfect for it. 
ARNOLD Good-bye, Darek. 
(THEN) I'm sorry. Arnold marches off the stage with his case. 
DAREK Simone! I need a new Lopakhin. Now. 
(CALLING OUT) I'm dying, Olga! Cigarettes! Cigarettes NOW! And COFFEE! 
SIMON We'll hold auditions this afternoon, Darek! I'll get the list -- Darek ingests caffeine and nicotine at an alarming rate : 
DAREK I've seen that shit-list! It's a disaster. 
SIMON What do we do? 
DAREK I must think. He moves stage left past Julie... 
DAREK (CONT'D) Djula! Your orchard cannot be felled before she has a chance to grow. And with that he disappears with Olga out the door. 
JULIE Perfect. Beat. 
MAX 
(A SHRUG) It is Ken Waterstone. She shoots him a look, picks up her stuff and goes... 
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 
Julie, on the phone, searches for her keys in the bag as she approaches her car. 
JULIE Yes, Stan, yes! I know it's bullshit but that's what's happening... 
(SHE LISTENS) I don't know, he's `thinking'... She gets in the car. Tries to find a roach in the ashtray. A KNOCK at the passenger window. She looks up. It's MAX. 
JULIE (CONT'D) What? He gestures, `Can I come in?'. Max gets in. 
JULIE (CONT'D) Sorry, I can't give you a ride -- 
MAX You said he was a natural. 
JULIE Stan. Let me call you back. (she hangs up, to Max) What? 
MAX Henry. 
JULIE Henry what? 
MAX Henry would be perfect for it. 
JULIE Perfect for what? 
MAX For Lophakin. It takes a moment till her mind gets a hold of the idea. 
JULIE You mean Henry should play Lophakin? 
HENRY Good God in Heaven. My father was one of your father's serfs, and your grandfather's serf before that. But you, you did so much for me in the old days that I've forgotten all that... His yearning is suddenly palpable. Intense. Tender. 
HENRY (CONT'D) I love you...like a sister...more than a sister. Henry drops to his knees, supplicates. 
DAREK You piece of shit! Yes! Henry just breathes. He's unbreakable. A beat. 
DAREK (CONT'D) Good. 
Henry looks up. 
HENRY Good? 
DAREK Yes. Darek considers him. 
DAREK (CONT'D) Tomorrow. Be more good. Henry and Julie share a look. He actually did it. 
INT. JULIE'S CAR -- NIGHT - MOVING 
She drives. Henry rides shotgun. They both look at the road ahead. In silence. After a while... 
JULIE Does this make me an accessory? 
HENRY I think so. A beat. 
JULIE Things have certainly gotten a lot more interesting since you showed up. 
HENRY You mean since you ran me over... She smiles. 
INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
They make love. It's more intense than before. They climax. They lie there, breathless, looking at each other... 
INT. KITCHEN TABLE - LATE AT NIGHT 
She makes tea. Henry sits at the table watching her. 
JULIE So why are you robbing the bank, Henry? He doesn't answer. 
JULIE (CONT'D) It's not just about the money, is it? 
HENRY No. 
JULIE So why are you doing it? It takes a moment for him to answer. 
HENRY I used to sit in that toll booth and think about just getting in one of those cars, going wherever they went. Just joining someone else's life. 
JULIE You were asleep at the wheel. Henry smiles. 
HENRY Yeah, I was. 
(THEN) It was easier for me to go to jail than tell my wife the truth. 
JULIE Which was? 
HENRY That I was going along with everything. I didn't know I could change it. 
(THEN) So now I'm changing it. 
JULIE Robbing the bank is changing it? 
HENRY It already has. She gets the honey out of the cupboard. Pours some in her tea. 
JULIE What was your wife like? 
HENRY Nice. A beat. 
HENRY (CONT'D) Are you sure you're okay with this? I know it's a lot. She turns to him. 
JULIE Not for a girl like me, Henry. 
INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE STAGE - MORNING 
Darek addresses the full cast. Henry by his side. 
DAREK This is Mr. Henry Smith. He will be taking over the role of Lophakin. If you please. He leads a light round of applause. Henry acknowledges 
IT: 
HENRY Thanks. Thank you. Looking forward. 
DAREK Top of act three. Twenty minutes. Olga, cigarettes! Henry walks briskly away. Julie watches him... 
INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - MORNING 
Henry enters his dressing room, locking the door behind him. Max is already waiting. He turns the music on. They move the GIANT ARMOIRE that's against the wall aside. Max spreads a blanket on the floor to catch the falling rubble and holds another against the wall to muffle the sound. Henry pulls a sledgehammer out of a bag : 
WHACK! He POUNDS the wall AGAIN and AGAIN... 
JOE 
(WIPING OFF) How? 
HENRY We might have a job for you. Max shoots a look at Henry. Joe chugs a glass of water, looking at both of them now. 
JOE No foolin'? 
INT. TUNNEL - DAY 
Henry, Max and Joe stand hunched over at the end of the tunnel. 
HENRY There's maybe twenty feet till the bottom of that vault. 
JOE That's a lot of dirt, Henry. Max studies Joe. 
HENRY So what do you think? 
JOE I think we should get some guns and go get the money through the front door! 
HENRY No guns. People could get hurt. 
JOE What about fake ones? 
HENRY They're still guns. 
MAX Listen Joseph, guns are dangerous and we're not doing a simple hold-up. Tellers and tears and chump change. We're doing an old fashioned heist. We're going right into the belly of the beast. 
(THEN) Are you in or are you in? 
ON JOE Considering it... He picks up a shovel and CRUNCHES into the wall of dirt. 
JOE I hope we don't get caught. 
INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
Henry and Julie are in bed. He memorizes his lines. The TV's on low. Julie's Buffaloto commercial comes on. Julie snaps it off. 
JULIE I hate that commercial. 
HENRY I like it. She looks at him. 
JULIE So what's your plan? 
HENRY For what? 
JULIE For when it's done. After. (making light of it) Am I going to see your picture in the post office or something? 
HENRY I hope not. 
JULIE But have you thought about what happens after? 
HENRY Not really, no. He thinks carefully before he says it : 
HENRY (CONT'D) I don't know. Maybe I could meet you out west... 
JULIE Out west? 
HENRY Yeah. Maybe you could meet me there. 
JULIE 
(SHE LAUGHS) When did you think of that? 
HENRY Just now. 
(THEN) So what about it? 
JULIE What about what? 
HENRY Meeting me -- 
JULIE -- I'm not going anywhere, Henry -- 
HENRY You're not? 
JULIE No. 
HENRY I thought that was your plan. Do the play 
AND -- 
JULIE Plans change, Henry. Okay? She gets out of bed. Throws on her robe. 
JULIE (CONT'D) I think I ran out of maple syrup. 
INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
EDDIE Relax, old man. Henry and I go way back. We've known each other since high school, isn't that right? 
HENRY Yeah. I know you. 
EDDIE Appreciate you keeping your mouth shut, Henry. One thing I admire in a man is the quality of loyalty. 
HENRY What do you want, Eddie? 
EDDIE Nothing. Just the American dream. 
CUT TO : 
MAX AND HENRY At the window. Looking down as EDDIE gets into his car. He senses them watching him. Turns around. Gives them the thumbs up. 
INT. APARTMENT - SAME TIME 
Max and Henry watch Eddie leave. 
MAX I'm gonna kill him. With a knife. 
HENRY You can't kill him. 
JOE (slurred, on the floor) Yeah. You can't kill him, Max. He's got the vault -- 
MAX Shut up, Joe. 
He looks over at Joe on the floor. Thinks about how easy it would be to just kick him in the head. 
JOE Deb says we can't have sex till the kid's born. Says the kid'll know about it. 
MAX Go home. Please. Before it's too late. 
CUT TO : 
INT. STAGE - DAY 
Henry in period costume. He has a beard. He watches from the stalls as they run a dress rehearsal. 
TROFIMOV I'm sorry to be blunt, but, for God's sake, the man has robbed you. 
MADAME RANEVSKY (stopping her ears) No! No! No! Don't say that! 
TROFIMOV He's a scoundrel: everybody knows it but you. He's a petty scoundrel, a user... ON HENRY, feeling like the accused. From the stage Julie sees him. 
MADAME RANEVSKY You are twenty six or twenty seven, and you're still in the lower grades! 
TROFIMOV Who cares? She locks eyes with Henry now : 
MADAME RANEVSKY You ought to be grown up by now. At your age, you ought to understand about love -- 
DAREK Where are you, Djula? Where?! 
MADAME RANEVSKY (with double the fire) You ought to love someone yourself! You ought to have an affair. Yes! Yes! 
DAREK Yes. Yes. Good Djula! Scene. 
(THEN) Carlotta and the girls. 
(MORE) 
DAREK (CONT'D) 
(A CLAP) Let's run the magic scene! Julie walks off the stage. She knows Henry is waiting for her. 
HENRY What happened last night? 
JULIE I came to my senses. 
(THEN) And you should too. She walks on. He follows... 
HENRY We should talk about it. She turns. 
JULIE I don't want to, Henry. 
INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER 
Henry arrives to find Max attaching one of the bags of dirt to a pulley. Above them, Joe begins to hoist it up through the open skylight. Henry looks up. 
MAX (tugging the pulley) Three feet of it so far today. We'll make it. Henry goes to the open doors of the Armoire. The tunnel is deeper now and all lit up... 
EXT. PARKING LOT BEHIND THE THEATRE - LATER 
Henry, Max and Joe make their way toward Joe's car. 
JOE What do you think guys? If it's a boy do I cut him or not? 
MAX Well, you know what they say, cleanliness is next to Godliness.

EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
AN AMBULANCE Peels into the drive. A PATIENT is wheeled inside. 
INT. HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT 
REVEAL HENRY Walking down a corridor toward a NURSE'S STATION at the far end. The doors open for him...he hesitates 
HENRY'S POV DEBBIE in profile, smiling and talking to a seated receptionist who touches her very pregnant belly. Henry takes a step back, the doors close. He watches through the glass a moment... Debbie looks radiant. Peaceful. Happy. 
HENRY Walks back outside again. It's as if he got all the answers he needed... 
INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 
Max and Joe are digging. Looks like they've been at it for hours - covered in dirt and sweat. Henry enters the tunnel. 
MAX There he is! 
Henry picks up his shovel. Starts to dig. He goes at it hard. Max catches his mood. 
MAX (CONT'D) You okay, Henry? 
HENRY No. He turns to Max. 
HENRY (CONT'D) I'm not leaving her. 
JOE Who? 
MAX The girl -- He throws down his shovel. 
MAX (CONT'D) Now listen, Henry. You're digging this tunnel. And you're gonna rob that bank. You're gonna take the money and you're gonna put it in the car and we're gonna drive away. 
(THEN) This is one thing. Julie is another thing. This is not that. That is not this. Understand? 
ON HENRY 
JOE Hey! I think I got something... Joe furiously digs his shovel into the caked-in dirt above his head. Suddenly the ceiling of dirt comes free burying Joe who struggles to get out. Above, from where the dirt once was, is the smooth surface of concrete. The bottom of the vault. 
MAX We have arrived! Look at that. Joe gets to his feet - he looks dazed. 
INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Henry and Max are finished packing up the apartment. Henry looks out the window. A beautiful clear blue sky. 
HENRY Not a cloud in the sky. 
MAX So clear you can see tomorrow. 
(THEN) You're a good man, Henry. Thank you. 
HENRY You too, Max. Let's go.

INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE, GREEN ROOM - SAME TIME 
The cast, dressed for stage, is gathered in the green room, chatting nervously to one another. 
HENRY AND JULIE Standing on opposite sides of the room. Hush descends as DAREK walks in. 
DAREK In this `American dream' of ours, everyone is happy and smiling, they have achieved their objectives...and yet in life there is only change, upheaval, the birth of the new...and that birth is painful. 
ON JULIE avoiding Henry's gaze. 
DAREK (CONT'D) Our play is about misery, disconnection, a future that we don't see hitting us like a train...but tonight, my players, we show them...that this not a future to fear! He leaves. The players applaud -- 
GAYEV 
(THRILLED) Off the cushion in the corner ; double into the centre pocket! Everyone laughs. 
SIMON Ten minutes people! 
INT. JULIE'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
Julie sits by her vanity finishing her make-up. A knock on the door. 
JULIE Come in. Henry appears. She's surprised. 
HENRY I want you to meet me in California. 
JULIE Henry, we've been over this -- 
Max struggles to the top of a telephone pole by an open electrical box. His cell phone vibrates. He pulls it out, reads it. 
"YOU" He unzips a fanny pack, pulls out a WIRE CUTTER, but his hands are trembling and he drops it... Thirty feet to the ground. 
CRACK! 
MAX Shit. 
INT. STAGE - SAME TIME 
Standing next to Simon, Henry watches Julie perform from the side of the stage. 
MADAME RANEVSKY Oh, my childhood, my innocent childhood! I used to sleep in this nursery. 
(MORE) 
MADAME RANEVSKY (CONT'D) I looked out from here into the garden. I woke up happy every morning. 
HENRY Isn't she beautiful? 
SIMON Yes. She looks out toward the window through which there is now a projection of the ORCHARD, this time in autumnal decay... 
MADAME RANEVSKY Oh, my cherry orchard... 
INT. BANK - SAME TIME 
ON FRANK Waiting...as he and Bernie watch Stan load the money into the vault. 
BERNIE You ever think what you could do with all that money, Frank? 
STAN I know what you'd do. Buy the Bills and put them in first place. 
BERNIE You'd need a lot more money than that. But I guarantee you I'd have them back in the Super Bowl within two seasons. 
STAN Perfect. Another chance to lose. Frank laughs nervously. 
EXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME 
Max picks up the wire cutters off the ground, checks his watch. His heart jumps. He starts up the pole again. Finally reaches the top. Struggles to find the right wire. 
MAX Oh god, oh god. Where are you, you little pischer? He finally finds the right one and CUTS IT : 
INT. BANK - SAME TIME 
Bernie and Stan place the last of the money in the vault. 
BERNIE We're good. Bernie closes the vault.

EXT. POWER POLE - SAME TIME 
Max looks at the screen. ALL THE NUMBERS MATCH. The red light turns GREEN. He sighs, relieved. 
LOPHAKIN (O.S.) I saw this excellent piece of theatre yesterday. Really very funny. 
INT. STAGE - NIGHT -- SAME TIME 
MADAME RANEVSKY I'm sure it wasn't in the least funny. I believe people like you should examine their own lives instead of going to the theatre to observe other peoples! 
LOPHAKIN True enough. To be honest. We live a stupid life. 
EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF BANK - SAME TIME 
Frank, Stan and Bernie are by the truck. 
STAN Well this is it, Frank. 
BERNIE We got you something. 
WHITE HEAT AND SPARKS EDDIE's manic face behind the mask, a man possessed, screaming, a river of molten steel dripping down right in front of him. KRUUUNK! The bottom of the vault drops onto the ground. 
INT. TUNNEL - A MINUTE LATER 
Smoke clears to reveal EDDIE. He pulls off his hood. 
EDDIE Welcome to my world, bitches. They all look up at THE HOLE. 
JOE Fuck, yeah. 
ON HENRY 
INT. VAULT - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
as his head rises into view through the newly cut hole. He climbs in and touches the saran-wrapped STACK OF CASH, subdivided into bricks. He sits on it. Thinking... It's dead quiet in here. Max pops his head up. Stares at the cash : 
MAX 
(SMILING) You're on, Henry! 
MADAME RANEVSKY (O.S.) Is the cherry orchard sold? 
INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS 
Audience's POV as Madame Ranevsky faces Lophakin on the other side of the stage. It's like a showdown. 
LOPHAKIN Yes. 
MADAME RANEVSKY Who bought it? Pause. 
LOPHAKIN I did. Madame Ranevsky is overwhelmed by the news. Varya takes her keys and throws them on the floor. Exits in a rage. 
LOPHAKIN (CONT'D) I bought it. Wait a minute ; don't rush me. I'm all dizzy. I can't talk... 
INT. VAULT -- SAME TIME 
EDDIE, JOE AND MAX Stuff duffel bags full of cash. 
JOE Deb's gonna freak. 
INT. STAGE - NIGHT 
Lophakin swirls on stage... 
LOPHAKIN ...and now the Cherry Orchard is mine. Mine! 
(LAUGHING) God! God in heaven. The Cherry Orchard is mine! Tell me I'm drunk, tell me I'm out of my mind, tell me I'm dreaming! 
INT. TUNNEL ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
EDDIE, JOE AND MAX Finish lining up the duffels of cash by the door. 
MAX That's everything. 
EDDIE Yes, it is. Max freezes, suddenly notices Eddie is standing there with A GUN pointed at him and Joe. 
MAX What's that, Eddie? 
EDDIE It's a gun, Max. Max doesn't seem so surprised. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) (with the gun) Joe! Take the money out back to my car. Joe doesn't move. Eddie waves the gun. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) Joe! Max boldly steps right in front of the gun. 
MAX Stay right where you are, Joe. Eddie puts the gun to Max's stomach. 
EDDIE Don't be stupid, Max. 
MAX You're not going to do this, Eddie. Eddie smiles. 
MAX (CONT'D) You can shoot me dead if you want, but you're going to have to shoot me dead. Eddie PUNCHES Max in the gut, then pops him in the head as he throws him back. 
EDDIE I'm not playing with you, old man. 
JOE What are you doing, Eddie? The door swings open -- HENRY -- walks in on the scene... 
EDDIE Welcome to the party, Brando. Seeing the gun, Henry freezes at the door. Eddie's in the middle, Max and Joe by the mouth of the tunnel, Max on the floor, a gash on his forehead from Eddie's blow. 
HENRY What are you doing, Eddie? Eddie turns at him. 
EDDIE It's money, Henry. Money. 
MAX This was your chance you idiot. You could've been a better man but you did it again. You messed up. And now you're back with the maggots. Just one big missed opportunity. Eddie kicks him again. 
JOE Yeah. Come on, Eddie. We're here. We're done. He's right. Come on, man. 
EDDIE Shut up, Joe. Get the money. Put it in the car. Shut up. He turns back to Henry. 
CUT TO : 
INT. STAGE -- SAME TIME 
The Peasants/hooded figures raise their axes. They suddenly have the manner of executioners... They stand ready to fell Madame Ranevsky's beloved orchard. 
JULIE (as Madame Ranevsky) One last look at these walls, these windows...Dear mother used to love to walk about in this room. 
GAYEV My sister! My sister! 
ANYA (O.S.) Mamma! 
TROFIMOV (V.O.) Aa-oo! 
JULIE (as Madame Ranevsky) We're coming. The sound of the HOODED FIGURES as they chop the trees behind her. It's horrific. Madame Ranevsky holds her hands over her ears and falls to the ground...and begins to weep... 
INT. CAR - SAME TIME 
HENRY Stop the car! 
MAX Henry! 
HENRY Joe, stop the car. 
MAX He can't stop the car, it's the getaway! 
JOE Yeah, you can't -- 
HENRY 
STOP THE FUCKING CAR! Joe screeches to a halt. Henry gets out of the car. 
MAX What the hell are you doing? Henry starts to run back toward the theatre as best he can... Max sticks his head out the window. 
MAX (CONT'D) Henry! But he's already gone... 
INT. STAGE - SAME TIME 
The HOODED FIGURES finish destroying the orchard. TREES litter the stage... Madame Ranevsky still holds her hands over her ears on the ground... 
As the cacophony ends, she gets up slowly and turns to walk off the stage... 
SHE FREEZES : 
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER Coming down the aisle is HENRY as LOPHAKIN Pause. He comes closer. He's limping slightly.... 
LOPHAKIN I had to come back. I couldn't get on the train. The moment I stepped on the platform, the blood drained from my heart. ON JULIE, in shock. 
LOPHAKIN (CONT'D) I knew I might never see you again. He steps up on the stage... 
ON DAREK 
DAREK What is he doing? Why is Lophakin back?! 
ON HENRY 
LOPHAKIN I had to come back. 
MADAME RANEVSKY 
(A WHISPER) Henry, what is this? What are you doing? 
LOPHAKIN This is the only way you'll listen to me. She looks out to the audience. EAGER FACES awaiting Madame Ranevsky's response... 
MADAME RANEVSKY You should have gotten on that stupid train. You made a mistake. 
LOPHAKIN The mistake would have been getting on that train without telling you how I feel. 
MADAME RANEVSKY Ha! Don't pretend you care about me. All you care about is money. 
She tries to get past him. He blocks her. 
LOPHAKIN You think this is about money? 
MADAME RANEVSKY Yes. He grabs her. 
HENRY It's never been about money. You know that. 
MADAME RANEVSKY Let go of me! 
LOPHAKIN No. 
MADAME RANEVSKY Damn it! Just leave, Henry! (under her breath) Get off the fucking stage -- 
HENRY Take a chance. Meet me in Moscow. 
MADAME RANEVSKY No, I'm perfectly happy here.

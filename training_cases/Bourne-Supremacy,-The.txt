1    EXT. MERCEDES WINDSHIELD -- DUSK                                       1 
It's raining... 
Light strobes across the wet glass at a rhythmic pace... 
Suddenly -- through the window a face -- JASON BOURNE -- riding in the backseat -- his gaze fixed. 
A1   INT. MERCEDES -- NIGHT                                                A1 
On his knee -- a syringe and a gun -- 
The eyes of the driver, JARDA, watching -- 
BOURNE'S POV -- the passenger -- back of his HEAD -- cell phone rings -- the HEAD turns -- it's CONKLIN -- 
BOURNE returns his stare... 
CUT TO -- 
2    INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                          2 
BOURNE'S EYES OPEN! -- panicked -- gasping -- trying to stay quiet -- MARIE sleeps. 
A2   INT. COTTAGE LIVING AREA/BATHROOM -- NIGHT                            A2 
BOURNE moving for the medicine cabinet. Digs through the medicine cabinet. Downs something specific. 
3    INT./EXT. COTTAGE LIVING ROOM/VERANDA -- NIGHT One minute later.       BOURNE moves out onto the veranda. 
MARIE pads in. Watching him for a moment. Concerned. Clearly it's not the first time this has happened. 
The   y both loo   k differe   nt than last we    saw them;    his hair is lon   ger. She'    s a blond   e. Hippie trav    elers. Th    eir cottage is    humble but    sweet.

MARIE Where were you, Jason? 
BOURNE In the car.         Conklin up front. 
MARIE I'll get the book. 
BOURNE No.    There's nothing new. 
MARIE You're sure? (he nods) We should still -- we should write it down. 
BOURNE Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --               * 
MARIE -- it hasn't been two years --                            * 
BOURNE -- it's alwa   ys bad and it's    never                   * anything but    bits and piece   s anyway!                * (she's    gone quiet)                               * You ever thi   nk that maybe i   t's just                 * making it wo   rse? You don't     wonder that?            * 
She lays her hands on his shoulders, steadies him. 
MARIE We write them down because sooner or                      * later you're going to remember something                  * good.                                                     * 
BOURNE (softens) I do remember something good.       All the time. I remember you. 
She smiles.     Kisses him.   Leads him back in. 
4   INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM -- NIGHT MARIE getting BOURNE into the bed. Turning down the light. Getting him settled. Waiting for that pill to kick in. What would he do without her? 
BOURNE I'm trying, Marie, Okay? 
MARIE I worry when you get like this. 
BOURNE It's just a nightmare. 
MARIE I don't mean that.   I worry when you try to ignore it. 
He    hesitates. But that gets him. He knows she's right. And    with that opening, he's letting go. Resistance fol   ding. Almost childlike. She's gathering him in. He'   s letting her do it... 
MARIE (CONT'D) Sleep.   Sleep now. 
BOURNE I should be better by now. 
MARIE You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over. 
BOURNE But it ends up the same. 
MARIE One day it will be different. It just takes time. (beat) We'll make new memories. You and me. 
Silence. She strokes his face. He gives in to her tenderness. He's fading. Two waifs in the dark.

NEVINS takes his overcoat off, tosses it on the empty chair. We see a big ass .45 for just a second under his suit jacket. 
NEVINS Alright, Mr.    Bourne, is that your name? (BOURN   E nods) Name's Nevin   s. I'm with the US Consulate. Could I see    your passport? 
BOURNE, silent, hands over his passport.

NICKY That I was an American student in Paris.

305    EXT. MOSCOW OUTDOOR MARKET -- DAY                          305 
A labyrinth of stalls. Food. Hardware. Clothes. And crowded. Even this hard-to-impress CROWD noticing --

THE CAB -- squibbing past SLOWER CARS and --                    * 
KIRILL on him -- move for move -- follow the leader and --      * 
BOURNE -- checks the rearview -- he's lost them all but the     * G-WAGON -- who the hell is that? --                             * 
The Heavyweights.   World Championship Belt up for grabs.       * 
KIRILL -- gaining -- nearly pulling level.                      * 
BOURNE -- nowhere to go -- that's never stopped him before -    * - he carves a path -- turns two lanes into three as             * sparks his way through a lane split --                          * 
THE G-WAGON -- roaring after him. 
BOURNE -- checks the mirror -- closer -- who the Hell is that guy? --

BOURNE -- BRAKES -- 
TUNNEL -- As the two vehicles scrape along each other -- 
KIRILL -- FIRING BACK -- odd angle -- 
BOURNE -- ducking for meager cover as bullets stitch through the roof --

KIRILL -- in a controlled fury -- 
354   INT. SIXTH FLOOR HALLWAY -- EVENING                          354 
IRENA -- her key at the door. Domestic disturbance playing across the hall. She opens up and -- 
355   INT. IRENA'S APARTMENT -- EVENING                            355 
It's dark.   And she's barely through the door when -- 
IRENA jumps -- chokes back a CRY -- 
BOURNE is standing there -- propped there actually -- behind her -- gun in hand -- motioning for her to be quiet -- 
BOURNE (his shabby Russian) (Quiet. Silence. Okay?) 
IRENA nods. Scared. Gun in hand, BOURNE pushes the door the last few inches so it's fully closed. 
IRENA (I have no money.       No drugs.   Is that what you want?) 
And now she can really see him. He's a disaster. Shivering. Bloody. Eyes more hollow than hers are. 
BOURNE Sit.  Can yo   u... (tryin   g to conjure the Russi   an--) (The chair.     Have the chair.) 
IRENA (accented) I speak English. 
BOURNE staring at her.    Nods.    Gestures for her to sit. 
BOURNE Please... 
So she does.   And here they are. 
BOURNE (CONT'D) (cont'd) Of all the p       eople in the world, you're the only one I h       ave anything to offer. (hesit       ating) That's why I        came here. 
IRENA (she's terrified) Okay. 
He'   s got some   thing bes   ide him. Somet    hing he's    taken off the    wall. IT    'S THE PH   OTOGRAPH. The     Neski fami   ly. Same as the    one that    was in th   e Hotel Brecker   . Mom, Da    d and Irena, arm   s around e   ach other   , in front of t   he house.     Before it was    abandoned   . Happy.      Smiling. Per    fect. 
BOURNE It's nice. (a beat) Does this picture mean anything to you?                          * (no answer)                                                * Hmm?                                                             * 
IRENA It's nothing. It's just a picture. 
BOURNE No. It's because you don't know how they died. 
IRENA (he couldn't understand) No, I do.                                                        * 
A change in BOURNE as he studies her, measures her.                Some moment of truth is here. IRENA braces, unsure. 
BOURNE I would want        to know. (beat) I would want        to know that my mother didn't kill my fath       er. I would want to know that        she didn't kill herself. 
IRENA What? 
She really looks at him now.           Fear overwhelmed by curiosity. 
BOURNE I would grow up thinking that they didn't love me if they just left me like that. 
Irena making sure her eyes don't leave his.    They don't. 
BOURNE (CONT'D) (cont'd) It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it? 
IRENA (wary) Yes... 
BOURNE That's not what happened to your parents. 
IRENA Then what? 
BOURNE I killed them. 
Body blows, but he has her attention.    She wipes a tear. 
BOURNE (CONT'D)                        * It was my jo   b. My first time. Your father was s   upposed to be alone. But then your mother,    she came out of nowhere... (a lit   tle shrug) I had to cha   nge my plan. (beat) You understa   nd me? (does    she?) You don't ha   ve to live like that anymore. Thinking tha   t. 
IRENA You killed them. 
BOURNE nods, that's right. 
BOURNE They loved you. (beat) And I killed them. 
IRENA                                     * How...how can...how can you be here and               * say this?                                             * 
BOURNE                                    * I don't want you to forgive me.                       * 
She stands suddenly. Stands because if she doesn't she'll burst into tears. Because she knows if she starts crying she won't be able to make sense of this. 
IRENA For who?                                              * (he doesn't answer) KILLED FOR WHO? 
BOURNE pushes himself to his feet.    A real effort. 
BOURNE It doesn't matter.     Your life is hard enough. 
IRENA You're a liar. 
BOURNE You know I'm not. 
IRENA YOU'RE A LIAR!

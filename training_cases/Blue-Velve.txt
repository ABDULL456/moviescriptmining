FADE IN: 
FOLDS OF BLUE VELVET UNDULATE EVER SO SLOWLY. 
WITH TITLES 
DISSOLVE TO: 
1. EXT. BEAUMONTS' FRONT LAWN - DAY 
Blue skies. PAN SLOWLY DOWN to clean white picket fence, with beautiful red roses in front of it. Birds CHIRP in the distance. A faint sprinkler SOUND is heard. Very sweet MUSIC is playing. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
2. EXT. TREE - DAY 
A songbird SINGS in the tree. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
3. EXT. CROSSWALK - SHADY STREET - DAY 
A very clean uniformed, smiling POLICEMAN with arms outstretched allows clean happy SCHOOL CHILDREN to cross the street safely. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
4. EXT. SHADY STREET - DAY 
A bright red gorgeous fire engine is moving very slowly down the street. 
We MOVE IN to see the happy face of a FIREMAN. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
5. EXT. FLOWER GARDEN - DAY 
Yellow tulips sway in a warm afternoon breeze. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
6. EXT. BEAUMONTS' FRONT LAWN - DAY 
The same white picket fence with roses in front of it. 
PANNING SLOWLY now away from the roses down to the rich green lawn and over to the sprinkler which goes around and around shooting water droplets sparkling in the light. 
This is slightly SLOW MOTION and DREAMY. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
7. EXT. BEAUMONTS' FRONT LAWN - DAY 
CLOSER ON WATER DROPLETS. The water droplets are somewhat abstracted as they dance in the light. 
PAN DOWN now to the green grass, traveling along the grass. 
The MUSIC becomes fainter as we MOVE SUDDENLY under the grass, now as if in a dark forest. 
SLOWLY MOVING THROUGH. 
The grass is like great timbers. 
It is GETTING DARKER and ominous SOUNDS come up as we discover black insects crawling and scratching in the darkness. 
FADE TO: 
8. EXT. BEAUMONT'S FRONT LAWN - DAY 
MR. BEAUMONT is watering flowers and grass with the hose. 
He is dressed in khaki trousers, canvas shoes, old white shirt, straw hat and dark glasses. 
CLOSE - MR. BEAUMONT 
watches his watering, then looks up. 
The sky and the neighborhood are reflected in his dark glasses.  He moves his false teeth around a little in his mouth, jutting out his chin in the process.  He's thinking about who knows what. 
He looks back down at his lawn. 
CLOSEUP - WATER ON GRASS 
The water hits the grass and mats it down. 
WIDER - MR. BEAUMONT 
moves the hose over a bush and gets a kink in it. 
Water stops coming out of the nozzle and there is a LOUD HISSING NOISE of water under pressure. 
CLOSEUP - KINK IN HOSE 
Loud HISSING NOISE. 
As Jeffrey moves quickly toward the telephone. 
JEFFREY I'm sorry, Louise. 
17. INT. PHONE/HALLWAY - COLLEGE - NIGHT 
The phone dangles on its cord in the foreground as Jeffrey moves toward it in the background.  Louise slowly follows Jeffrey, but stays in back of him.  Jeffrey picks up the phone.

You're going to have to work at the store.

FADE TO: 
23. INT. GIRLS DORM LOBBY - COLLEGE - NIGHT 
Jeffrey is waiting in a girls dorm lobby for Louise. 
Girls are milling around.  Louise gets off an elevator with some other girls.  She forces a smile at Jeffrey as she comes toward him. 
JEFFREY Can't you come to the damn airport? 
LOUISE Jeffrey. I can't. I really can't. I have to go to that class tonight. I can't get out of it. I really can't. I love you, Jeffrey. I'll miss you. 
JEFFREY Alright. I'll call you in a couple of days, you know. I'll let you know how things are. 
LOUISE Okay. I'll be here. You better git-going. I gotta go too sweetie. I hope your father's okay. I love you. I'm sorry, Jeffrey. 
JEFFREY I love you too, Louise. Damn it. I'll see you. 
They kiss. 
CUT TO: 
24. EXT. LANDING STRIP 
A PLANE TAKES OFF 
DISSOLVE TO: 
25. EXT. ANOTHER LANDING STRIP 
A PLANE LANDS 
26. EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT 
Jeffrey comes walking out of the airport, where his Mother and AUNT BARBARA, who is a very absent-minded little woman with very thick glasses, are waiting for him. 
They are parked illegally and another car is honking at them.  Their trunk is open in anticipation of Jeffrey's things.  They are waving and yelling at Jeffrey to get his attention.  He finally joins them and kisses his Mother, then his Aunt. 
JEFFREY Hi Mom. Hi Aunt Barbara. 
They AD LIB hellos. 
MRS. BEAUMONT (a bit concerned) Where's all your things, Jeffrey? 
JEFFREY This is it. 
Mrs. Beaumont looks at Jeffrey. 
JEFFREY I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have. 
AUNT BARBARA You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight? 
34. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
All he can see are curtains surrounding a bed and stacks of medical machinery.  Doctor Gynde comes out from behind the curtains and walks to Jeffrey. 
DR. GYNDE Hello Jeffrey. 
JEFFREY Hello, Doctor Gynde. How is he? 
DR. GYNDE He's fighting hard. Jeffrey. it's very important that your father doesn't try to move. he's been immobilized. It would be very painful for him. sit close. you do the talking and moving. He knows you're here. He became very emotional. I don't think he likes the idea of you seeing him like this. 
Nurse Cindy goes to the bed.  She begins to pull the curtains back revealing Mr. Beaumont. 
NURSE CINDY (smiling a big smile) Mr. Beaumont! Your son is here to visit you. 
Then we see Mr. Beaumont.  He has numerous tubes and needles going into different parts of him.  A stainless steel device holds his head perfectly still.  Nurse Cindy picks up a tray and leaves. 
JEFFREY (shocked but concealing it) Hi Dad. 
MR. BEAUMONT (speaking as plainly as possible, but sounds like mumbling) Hey Jeff. 
Jeffrey goes to him and puts out his hand to shake his father's hand but remembers his father cannot move.  Jeffrey pats him on the shoulder. 
JEFFREY Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good. 
MR. BEAUMONT (lips moving but hardly any sound) uh uh. 
JEFFREY Are you feeling okay? 
MR. BEAUMONT (more mumbling) uh uh. 
Tears well up in Mr. Beaumont's eyes.  Before Jeffrey can stop him he reaches for Jeffrey's hand, then struggling against tremendous pain he manages to form words. 
MR. BEAUMONT (more plainly but under strain) Good to see you, son. 
JEFFREY (holding back tears) It's good to see you, Dad. 
Jeffrey squeezes his father's hand. 
35. EXT. VACANT FIELD - DAY 
Jeffrey is walking down a dirt road on his way home.  He kicks up little clouds of dust as he walks.  He has some time to think about things. He sees a green bottle in the distance. He gathers up a few more rocks and pitches them one by one at the bottle.  He misses. 
He looks for a few more good rocks to throw and while looking through some tall grass and weeds, he sees something strange. 
He looks closer.  It is a HUMAN EAR, covered with crawling ants. 
Jeffrey immediately stands up and looks around.  All he sees are houses - some laundry drying - a very peaceful scene.  No one seems to be around - No one seems to be watching him. 
He looks again at the ear. 
We are so close we can hear ants racing frantically around the ear into it. There is dried blood on part of it. 
Jeffrey finds a brown paper bad and using a twig, he pushes the ear onto it.  Again, he stands up and looks around. 
IN THE DISTANCE, a MAN goes into the back door of a house.  Nothing more. 
Jeffery hurries off, carrying the bag with the ear in it. 
CUT TO: 
36. EXT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY 
Jeffrey goes up the front steps... 
37. INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY 
... and to the Reception Desk.  A POLICE OFFICER is standing behind the counter. 
JEFFREY Hello. could you tell me if Detective Williams is still working here? 
POLICE OFFICER He's up in Room 221. Right up the stairs. 
CUT TO: 
38. 	INT. ROOM 221 - POLICE STATION - DAY 
Jeffrey enters Room 221 and sees the desk marked, "DETECTIVE J.D. WILLIAMS," however, the desk is empty.  TWO MEN are talking at the end of the room; one of them comes toward Jeffrey. 
JEFFREY Are you Detective Williams? 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Yes. 
JEFFREY My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store? 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he? 
JEFFREY He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear. 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS (matter of factly) You did? A human ear? 
JEFFREY Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you. 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it. 
Jeffrey opens the bag and lets Detective Williams look inside. 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS (continuing) That sure looks like a human ear, doesn't it?. Let's run it down to the Coroner's Office and see what they make of it. Then, I want you to show me exactly where you found it. 
JEFFREY Pest control. gotta do your apartment. 
DOROTHY Oh God, that stuff stinks. 
JEFFREY (as he goes in) Nope. it's new stuff. no smell. 
DOROTHY Oh yeah, that's good. 
68. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Jeffrey goes all around the baseboards, spraying.  All the while he's getting a good look around the apartment. 
There is a window above the kitchen sink out to the fire escape.  Jeffrey looks around to see what Dorothy is doing and she is watching him spraying. The apartment is smaller than he thought, so he sprays the kitchen very slowly and makes believe the sprayer is jammed. 
Suddenly, there is knocking at the door. 
DOROTHY What is this. Grand Central Station? 
She opens the door.  Jeffrey looks. It's not Sandy. A MAN, with a yellow sports coat, is standing there.  Jeffrey begins to sweat, because the MAN looked around Dorothy to see him.  Dorothy says something to the Man which Jeffrey cannot hear. 
The next time Jeffrey looks up, the Man is gone.  The whole thing looks to be turning out badly when Jeffrey spots a key on the counter.  On a long shot, he steals it just as the front door shuts. He wraps things up and gets out. 
JEFFREY (to Dorothy) That oughta do it. 
DOROTHY Yeah. 
69. 	INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
Jeffrey leaves.  Out on the stairs, he finds Sandy with her "Awake" magazines. 
SANDY Are you alright? 
JEFFREY Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened? 
As they go downstairs, 
SANDY I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright? 
JEFFREY Yes and no. Did you recognize him? 
SANDY No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall. 
JEFFREY I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key. (he shows it to her) Pretty nifty, huh? 
SANDY Yeah, if it opens the door. 
JEFFREY Yeah. 
70. 	INT. LOBBY - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
They get to the door of the apartment building. 
JEFFREY You go first. 
71. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - DAY 
They leave the building separately.  When Jeffrey gets to the car, Sandy isn't there.  He looks around.  He starts the car and drives off. 
There, up ahead, he spots her.  He pulls over and she gets in. 
SANDY So. what's next? 
JEFFREY Pretty clever. Are you game for more? 
SANDY I owe you. since I goofed up this one. 
JEFFREY You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight? 
SANDY Yes. I do. 
JEFFREY Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that. 
72. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/WILLIAMS HOME - DAY 
Jeffrey is driving Sandy home. 
SANDY You really want to do this, don't you? 
JEFFREY I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder. 
They pull up in front of Sandy's house. 
SANDY (making up her mind - against her better judgment) I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do? 
JEFFREY (studies her a moment, then) First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings. 
SANDY I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7. 
JEFFREY Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good? 
SANDY Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock. 
JEFFREY Okay. You better get out before someone sees us. 
Sandy gets out of the car and without turning around walks into her house.  Jeffrey calls out after her. 
JEFFREY See ya! 
JEFFREY (raising his glass) Here's to. an interesting experience. 
SANDY I'll drink to that. 
They drink. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
77. INT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT 
Later. Jeffrey and Sandy have just finished dinner.  The M.C. is arranging a floral art deco microphone and a SAXOPHONE PLAYER, a BASS PLAYER, and a DRUMMER are on stage. 
M.C. (very low key) Ladies and gentlemen. The Blue Lady. Miss Dorothy Vallens. 
There is quite a round of applause, even though most people continue laughing, talking, and drinking.  Dorothy Vallens comes out on stage. 
She smiles. The house lights are still up. As she sings the first lines of "BLUE MOON" the house lights go down and a blue spot light comes up on her as she sings the word, "Blue." This is a very sexy and slow version of the song. 
During the song, Jeffrey and Sandy look at one another with the thought that this is the woman whose apartment they are about to break into. 
Jeffrey and Sandy leave as Dorothy starts her next song, "BLUE VELVET." They hear the first few lines before they get out the door. 
78. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT 
They hurry to the car, get in, and drive off. 
CUT TO: 
79. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR - NIGHT 
Jeffrey and Sandy drive through dark areas of the city.  They don't talk as they drive, but again they sneak glances at one another. 
80. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT 
They turn in to the street where Dorothy Vallens lives and glide to a stop close to the building.  Jeffery cuts the engine. 
It is very quiet.  Both are looking around to see if anyone is out or watching.  Jeffrey tries to look up out the front windshield to the Seventh Floor.  It is dark.  Sandy moves.  Every tiny sound is heard. Sandy looks at Jeffrey for some time, then back at the building. 
SANDY Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it. 
JEFFREY Why not? 
SANDY It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you. 
JEFFREY It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car? 
SANDY Yeah. but. 
JEFFREY Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay? 
SANDY O.K. 
JEFFREY Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit. 
SANDY . I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee. 
JEFFREY I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went. 
SANDY I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over. 
JEFFREY Oh, okay. can I call? 
SANDY Okay. yeah, call. 
JEFFREY Look. it can wait till Sunday. 
SANDY Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep? 
JEFFREY Yeah. 
SANDY I'm going to wait here until she comes. 
JEFFREY Are you sure? 
SANDY I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay? 
Jeffrey nods. 
JEFFREY Okay. thanks. 
SANDY I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert. 
JEFFREY That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay? 
SANDY Okay, okay. Bye. 
Jeffrey gets out of the car and shuts the door.  He looks in one more time at Sandy.  They stare at each other silently. 
Jeffrey can see her lips in the black darkness of the car.  Sandy watches him cross the lawn and go into the apartment building.  She slides over and sits in the driver's seat. 
CUT TO: 
81. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Jeffrey hurries up the stairs to the Seventh Floor. 
SOMEONE comes out of an apartment just as Jeffrey gets to the Seventh Floor. 
JEFFREY Jeffrey. 
DOROTHY Jeffrey. Jeffrey what? 
JEFFREY Jeffrey nothing. 
DOROTHY You tell me!! Let me see that wallet. (reads his license) Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont? 
JEFFREY I wanted to see you. 
DOROTHY What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here? 
JEFFREY Nobody. 
DOROTHY Shit. You better tell me something. 
JEFFREY I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it. 
DOROTHY An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before. 
JEFFREY I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you. 
DOROTHY Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME. 
JEFFREY (scared, nervous) . I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed. 
DOROTHY (interrupting) The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word. 
JEFFREY (trying to remember) You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more. 
Dorothy stares at Jeffrey studying him for some time thinking. 
DOROTHY That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what? 
JEFFREY Well. 
DOROTHY THEN WHAT? 
JEFFREY Then you got undressed. 
DOROTHY How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress? 
JEFFREY (quietly; feeling guilty) Never before this. 
DOROTHY How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you. (gets an idea) Get undressed. I want to see you. 
JEFFREY No. Come on. 
DOROTHY NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you. 
JEFFREY Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave. 
DOROTHY No way. 
Dorothy moves to the kitchen counter and gets a knife.  She goes to Jeffrey.  Now she has a knife and a gun.  He's scared. 
DOROTHY Get undressed. I want to see you. 
Jeffrey begins to undress. First he takes off his shoes and socks, Then his shirt.  He undoes his belt and unzips his pants and takes them off.  Now he is only in his underwear. 
DOROTHY STAND UP. 
He does. 
DOROTHY (continuing) Come closer. 
Dorothy has a strange look on her face.  She reaches out and pulls Jeffrey's underpants down to his knees.  She looks at him. 
DOROTHY (whispering) What do you want from me? 
JEFFREY (quietly, getting very hot) I . I don't know. 
DOROTHY (whispering) What do you want? 
Dorothy is getting very DREAMY and begins to talk in a childlike voice. She opens her robe and pulls Jeffrey to her breasts. 
DOROTHY Don't move. don't look at me. 
Jeffrey's eyes close with nervous ecstasy as Dorothy begins touching him. 
DOROTHY Do you like that? 
JEFFREY Yes. 
He tries to touch her. 
DOROTHY Don't move or I'll kill you. 
She looks at him. 
DOROTHY (continuing) Do you like talk like that? 
JEFFREY No. 
DOROTHY Lie down on the bed. 
He lies down.  He looks frightened. 
JEFFREY I'll go then. 
He starts to put on his underwear.  They're inside out.  He tries to turn them around. 
DOROTHY Don? 
JEFFREY No. 
DOROTHY Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please. 
Jeffrey turns to her.  He studies her.  He reaches out and takes her shoulders.  He moves down and holds her. 
DOROTHY (whispering) Thank you. honey. 
JEFFREY (whispering) It's okay. It's okay. 
They lie together for a long silent moment. 
DOROTHY Do you like the way I feel? 
JEFFREY (hesitates) Yes. 
DOROTHY See my breasts?  . See? 
Jeffrey looks. 
JEFFREY Yes. 
DOROTHY See my nipples? 
JEFFREY Yes. 
DOROTHY (whispering) You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard. 
Jeffrey starts to move closer.  Dorothy closes her eyes. 
DOROTHY (continuing) Go ahead. I don't mind. 
Jeffrey can't help himself.  He licks and sucks her nipples and feels her breasts.  They both are getting very hot. 
DOROTHY Feel me. 
Jeffrey is all over her now.  Dorothy suddenly seems to recognize him. 
DOROTHY You can hit me, if you want to. 
JEFFREY No. please. I won't. 
Dorothy arches back and whining she throws her head back hard against the wall. 
JEFFREY Stop it! 
She moves and won't let him feel her anymore.  She holds his hands away. 
DOROTHY (whispering) Do you like me? 
JEFFREY (whispering) Yes, I like you. 
DOROTHY (whispering) You can be my special friend and come and put that in me. 
They start making love.  Suddenly, Dorothy starts crying. 
JEFFREY What's the matter? 
Suddenly Dorothy slaps Jeffrey in the face. very hard. 
DOROTHY Get off me. 
Jeffrey gets off her, pressing his hand to his face.  Dorothy goes into the bathroom crying all the way.  Jeffrey sits, confused. 
Suddenly Jeffrey hears a horrible scream from Dorothy.  A true scream of horror.  He rushes into the bathroom to see what is wrong. 
92. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
She is just flushing something down the toilet.  The water SOUND rushes. He turns to her.  She is trembling and in a state of shock. 
DOROTHY I made it go down the toilet. 
JEFFREY What? 
He looks in the swirling water. It looks like an ear revolving around and around then whatever it is disappears. 
DOROTHY I made it go down the toilet. 
Jeffrey looks up. he sees written with a bar of soap the words "look down" on the mirror. 
He looks down into the sink.  At the bottom he sees a small clot of blood and a smear of fresher blood. 
Jeffrey suddenly remembers mentally Frank's high helium voice reverberating in the bathroom. 
93. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
FLASHBACK 
Frank in bathroom. 
94. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
119. INT. BACK STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
. to a back stairway leading to the roof. 
120. EXT. ROOFTOP - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
The storm is closer and the dark clouds move violently in front of a full moon.  The wind continues to moan.  They move to the roof top and Dorothy leads Jeffrey through the chimneys to the edge of the building.  A very sad forlorn version of "Somewhere over the Rainbow" - creeps through the wind. 
DOROTHY (as she stares down) Look. 
JEFFREY (turning to her quickly) No. 
DOROTHY (continuing to look down, her eyes widening - she whispers) Falling. 
JEFFREY No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble? 
He moves closer to her. 
JEFFREY (continuing) Who is Don? 
DOROTHY (very crazy and angry) Don?. Are you in with them? 
JEFFREY (whispering) No. But you're in very big trouble. 
DOROTHY Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me? 
JEFFREY I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.? 
DOROTHY Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh? 
JEFFREY Yes. 
DOROTHY (whispering) . or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now. 
JEFFREY No. I should go. 
DOROTHY Please. please stay. 
She makes him kiss her. he really likes it.  Once again, Jeffrey and Dorothy get VERY HOT.  Dorothy and Jeffrey lie down on the roof.  Dorothy cries out suddenly and bangs her head hard again and again against the roof. 
JEFFREY Why Dorothy? 
We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper into it. 
DOROTHY Don? I have to make it hurt. I want there to be nothing again. Don!!! (as she slams her head again and again) 
She reaches up and clutches Jeffrey then pulls him down with a feverish kiss.  Lightening cracks above them and the wind howls. 
FADE TO WHITE: 
FADE DOWN TO: 
121. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT 
Jeffrey leaves the pool of light from a street light and walks into darkness.  He continues down the sidewalk.  He looks up at the starry sky. The stars are so far away - the feeling is cold and lonely. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
121A. 
Darkness: There are bell tones sounding, and as each one sounds pin points of light appear on Mr. Beaumonts distorted dream face.  He is trying to speak.  He's trying to say "Jeffrey." 
121B. 
Another dark image appears.  A robin sits in a tree at night.  Very close. There is a slow low reverberating chirping sound. 
121C. 
Now Dorothy's apartment building at night.  A very low angle looking up to the roof.  Suddenly a pinpoint of red appears coming toward us from the roof.  It flies toward us very fast growing larger until we see it is a red high-heeled shoe.  As it fills the screen it becomes red lips of Dorothy's which open into a scream. 
121D. 
Jeffrey wakes in his room - terrified. 
122. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Jeffrey is talking with Aunt Barbara in the semi-dark living room. 
JEFFREY Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house? 
AUNT BARBARA Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house. 
JEFFREY Oh yeah?. Have you seen any? 
AUNT BARBARA I've seen a few. 
JEFFREY Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go. 
AUNT BARBARA Okay honey. 
Jeffrey leaves and Aunt Barbara moves about tapping on the walls.  She moves into a dark area and taps.  Something falls.  She reaches down. 
In EXTREME CLOSEUP we see a termite walking by her shoe on the thick carpet.  Then in EXTREME CLOSEUP we see Aunt Barbara's fingers pinch the termite and bring it up in front of her thick glasses for a look.  She looks at the termite, then looks back at the walls. 
We GLIDE ALONG the dark walls of the house. 
CUT TO: 
JEFFREY Well. (looking around, feeling funny) Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean? 
Just then, Mrs. Williams starts down with the coffee for Jeffrey. She sees Mike at the bottom of the stairs.  This seems strange to her. 
MRS. WILLIAMS Mike?. Are you alright? 
Mike starts upstairs. 
MIKE (mumbling) Yes. 
Downstairs, Jeffrey and Sandy hear that Mike was close by.  Mrs. Williams and Mike pass on the stairs and Mrs. Williams enters the basement.  She throws Sandy a concerned look.  Just then, Mike calls downstairs. 
MIKE Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute? 
SANDY (calling up) Sure. just a sec. (to Jeffrey) Excuse me. 
125. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Upstairs, Mike is by the front door. 
MIKE Come on out a minute, okay? 
SANDY Okay. 
They leave. 
125A. INT. WILLIAMS' BASEMENT - NIGHT 
Downstairs Mrs. Williams picks up some dishes. 
MRS. WILLIAMS Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes. 
JEFFREY Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes? 
MRS. WILLIAMS Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon. 
Detective Williams comes to the top of the stairs and calls down. 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Jeffrey? 
JEFFREY Yes? 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures. 
126. INT. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS' STUDY - NIGHT 
Jeffrey enters Detective Williams' study. 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS (continuing) Take a look at these. These are the photos of the vacant lot where you found the ear. You might find them interesting. 
Jeffrey begins going through the pictures.  They are 8 X 10 black and white prints.  Mostly they are pictures of weeds, but they look quite beautiful in an abstract way.  As he goes through them. 
JEFFREY These are beautiful. How's the case coming? 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Okay. 
JEFFREY Anything you can tell me? 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS The criminals are winning. 
JEFFREY Is that why you say it's horrible? 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Yes. 
JEFFREY I guess you've seen some bad things. 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you. 
JEFFREY Why do you do it? 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance. 
JEFFREY Yeah. I get it. 
Suddenly Jeffrey sees something in the black and white photos.  A piece of cloth in the grass.  Carefully he asks. 
JEFFREY What is this? What color is it? 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS (leaning over to see) Blue. It's Blue Velvet. 
Sandy comes into her father's study looking upset.  Detective Williams puts the photos away. 
SANDY Can I use the car for a while? 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Sure. What's up? 
SANDY I want to buy Jeffrey a Dairy Queen. 
JEFFREY A Dairy Queen? (he holds his stomach) Oh yeah? Sure, that sounds great.

Jeffrey gets in and Sandy starts the car.  She pulls out.  They drive away. 
JEFFREY What's with Mike? 
FRANK (telephone V.O.) Speak to me Fucker. 
Jeffrey hangs up immediately.  He's scared. 
JEFFREY (to himself) Stupid!! So stupid. now she might be in even more trouble with Frank. I hope not. I hope not. tomorrow I have to find out more about Frank. 
133. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY 
Jeffrey has a camera taped and rigged to the dashboard aimed at the front door of Frank Booth's apartment building.  The camera is covered with a cardboard shoe box.  Jeffrey is eating a sandwich which was wrapped in wax paper and is waiting and watching. 
A LADY steps out of the building and begins walking down the steps. Jeffrey reaches over and removes the shoe box and quickly takes two pictures. 
We see a MAN walk down the street and turn up the steps.  Jeffrey shoots, but really only gets the back of the man. 
JEFFREY Damn! 
He replaces the cardboard box and continues eating. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
134. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY 
Later in the day.  Jeffrey sits waiting.  He looks at his watch.  It says 
As he looks up he sees Frank getting out of a car with another man. the Yellow Man.  They head for Frank's building.  Jeffrey hurriedly removes the shoe box and begins snapping pictures.  They mount the steps and disappear within the old dark structure. 
JEFFREY Wow. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
135. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY 
Jeffrey's watch - the hand - time lapses around to 3:00. 
JEFFREY (out loud to himself) Fifteen more minutes. 
Just then, he sees movement and takes the box off the camera.  He starts shooting as TWO MEN come out the door.  It is the Yellow Man and a man who is very well dressed with wavy hair and a mustache.  He carries an alligator-skin briefcase FRANK HAS DISAPPEARED.  Both are talking together and now laughing.  Jeffrey takes five or six pictures and then tries to cover the camera as they approach.  The box falls.  The Yellow Man looks, but Jeffrey gets the box back in time and pretends to be looking in the glove compartment. 
The two men walk right by Jeffrey and get into the car behind his. Jeffrey decides to follow them.  He waits a few seconds and starts off. 
136. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 
They drive through town. 
137. FACTORY BUILDING - DAY 
. to a large factory building, park and go up a flight of metal stairs on the side of the building.  Jeffrey steps into the shadows and watches them.  At a metal landing they stop.  He sees them standing on their tip toes in order to see something in the distance.  The man with the alligator briefcase is laughing with the Yellow Man at what he sees.  He grips the Yellow Man on the shoulder.  Jeffrey cannot see what they see from his vintage point.  He looks at his watch. "3:25". 
JEFFREY You gotta wait for me Sandy. I'm on a real roll. 
He quickly takes a picture of the two of them on the staircase. 
138. EXT. ALLEY - DAY 
. then he goes down an alley in the direction they were looking.  At the end of the alley he turns left and stops short. 
139. EXT. COLD STORAGE COMPANY - DAY 
He sees a crowd of people, an ambulance, and two police cars.  He walks closer.  Through the crowd he sees a broken window.  Hanging in the window is a dead man.  Blood is dripping out of a huge wound to the head. 
On the sidewalk in front of the building a woman is lying in shock. Her legs have been brutally broken and are angled back toward her head in horrible positions.  Jeffrey stands next to two black guys.  Suddenly one of the police officers start pushing everyone away.  Jeffrey turns to them. 
JEFFREY What happened? 
GUY #1 He was blown away man. can't you see? 
GUY #2 That cracker was the biggest dealer in this section of the city, brother. the police are going to find more drugs in there than you can believe. It's a speedball heaven in there. 
JEFFREY Oh yeah? What about the woman? 
GUY #1 Probably just a whore he happened to be with at the time. 
JEFFREY Man oh brother. 
GUY #1 This is the way the world is my man. take a good look. 
Jeffrey takes a last look before checking his watch and hurrying off. 
CUT TO: 
140. EXT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
Jeffrey drives up to the corner where Sandy is standing.  She is frantically looking around.  Jeffrey stops for her. 
SANDY (looking beyond the car) GO ON!!!. GO! 
Jeffrey looks around.  A big FOOTBALL PLAYER is running up to a chain link fence across the street, but it's too late - Mike sees Jeffrey. Everything stops for a moment.  Then, Mike runs off. 
SANDY Oh great. 
141. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
Sandy goes around and gets in the car. 
SANDY (continuing) You were late. 
JEFFREY I'm really sorry. 
She moves closer to him, towards his back touching it with her tongue. She gets down in a pose and holds it. 
DOROTHY I'm a statue. you can feel me.you can do anything you want. 
Jeffrey's hands find her flesh and move about. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Jeffrey and Dorothy are making love in her bed in almost total darkness. 
DOROTHY (dreamily) What do you want to do? 
JEFFREY I'm doing it. 
DOROTHY Are you a bad boy? 
JEFFREY Whatiya mean? 
DOROTHY Do you want to do bad things? (very dreamy) Anything. anything. 
JEFFREY (whispering hot) What do you want? 
DOROTHY I want you to hurt me. 
JEFFREY No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you. (she doesn't react) . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police. 
DOROTHY No police!!!. (pushing herself back against the headboard; then frantic) No police!! 
Suddenly, Dorothy gets very odd.  She turns into a little girl.  She has a frightening little girl smile. 
DOROTHY You like to open me. don't you? 
JEFFREY Yes. 
DOROTHY (thinking with a grin) What if I told Frank that you opened me? 
For just one quiet moment we see the stairway to Dorothy's apartment. It is empty.  Then back to Jeffrey and Dorothy. 
JEFFREY That wouldn't be too good, would it? 
DOROTHY Frank would open you. 
JEFFREY Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone. 
DOROTHY (smiles very strangely) Does that scare you? 
JEFFREY Shut up. 
DOROTHY Beeeee careful. 
JEFFREY (scared and mad) Come on Dorothy. 
DOROTHY What if Frank came over here and found us? 
The curtains in the kitchen bellow out with an eerie gust of wind. 
JEFFREY Look, snap out of it, will ya? 
DOROTHY Kiss me. 
They kiss. 
DOROTHY (continuing) Do you love me? 
JEFFREY Do you love me? 
DOROTHY I asked first. 
JEFFREY Sometimes I think I do. 
DOROTHY And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then! 
She bolts up. 
JEFFREY Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud! 
DOROTHY Just get outta my bed. 
She hits out at Jeffrey and strikes him in the face.  Jeffrey struggles with her to keep her from hitting him again but she breaks loose and slams out at his face again.  He pushes back hard and her head actually hits the wall.  She smiles through the pain. 
JEFFREY Oh God. are you alright. 
She falls on him and smothers him with kisses. 
DOROTHY See. see how you hurt me? Now. Open me. enter me. 
Jeffrey moves on top of her in the darkness. 
We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper into it. 
DOROTHY I love you Don with all my heart. 
JEFFREY No. it's not Don. 
But he can't stop himself or her from making love. 
DOROTHY Come inside me. Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. (very frantic) Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. 
147. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Frank takes Jeffrey on a wide-eyed terror walk down the stairway. 
CUT TO: 
148. INT. FRANK'S CAR/CITY STREETS - NIGHT 
Frank and Dorothy are in the front seat.  Jeffrey is sandwiched between two very dirty strange guys in the back.  Frank is driving very fast and very crazy.  Sitting next to him on the front seat is a police radio which periodically blares out police reports.  At the lights, when they turn green, Frank lays rubber. 
FRANK Where you wanna go? I know!. We gotta see Ben. We gotta, right? 
PAUL (laughing) Yeah. we gotta see Ben. 
The car roars through a seedy street lined with bars and clubs.  Liquor and sex shop signs glow in hot neon colors.  They are blurred visions because of the speed of Frank's car. 
Driving music plays. Frank careens dangerously down various narrow streets, just barely making turns.  The Ford bounces off several curbs.  Dorothy occasionally steals a glance back at Jeffrey.  She squeals out loud - sometimes with glee, mostly in fear. 
Raymond and Paul laugh with Frank, yell out or light cigarettes. 
149. EXT. "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT 
Frank finally gets to where he's going - a corner bar - and skids to a hault.  They all pile out.  Frank grabs Jeffrey. 
FRANK Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too. 
RAYMOND Okay Frank. 
FRANK (to Jeffrey) What kinda beer do you like? 
JEFFREY (just says it) Heineken. 
FRANK FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!! 
He grabs Jeffrey and pushes him into the bar. 
150. INT. "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT 
Moving fast now, they go through this dark frightening place.  Frank has Jeffrey by the neck forcing him faster.  In the back there is a black man fondling a white girl near a doorway. 
151. INT. BACK ROOM - "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT 
They go through the door to a back room.  A few naked girls are there near beds with curtains around them.  One girl lies on her bed with dried vomit around her head and pillow.  Suddenly Frank spots his friend Willard. He runs toward him violently and grabs him by the throat. 
FRANK Hey shithead. that's the last time I get you high and watch you freak out - motherfucker you tore my coat and I lost my lucky piece of blue velvet, man. 
152. 	INT. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS' STUDY - NIGHT

154. INT. STAIRS AND LANDING - BEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
... and go up a flight of dirty wooden steps.  Frank bangs on a door at the first landing.  Raymond joins him with a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer. 
FRANK Hey Ben. OPEN UP. It's Frank. 
A tall, slender man with a smoking jacket and a mustache opens the door. It's BEN.  His voice is very horse from years of smoking. 
BEN (very gracious) Frank. Come in. 
FRANK Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer. 
BEN Fine. Welcome. Come sit down. 
155. INT. BEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The apartment is very large.  All the furniture is over-stuffed.  In the room there is a very much over-weight WOMAN dressed in black and a greasy-looking COUPLE.  On the couch, a YOUNG WOMAN plays with a large doll. 
FRANK (getting higher all the time) Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer? 
BEN (smiling) Certainly Frank. (to the fat woman) Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down? 
Everyone kinds of mills around.  Paul sits down in a chair and starts laughing at some private joke in his head. 
FRANK Shit Ben! How the shit are ya? 
BEN Fine Frank. Fine. How are you? 
FRANK Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too. 
DOROTHY (very anxious) Frank? 
FRANK You want to see him too, right? 
DOROTHY Yes, but. 
FRANK Then, shut up! 
Frank sees Dorothy look back at Jeffrey. 
FRANK (continuing) Hey. What's this fuck got to do with anything. 
159. INT. FRANK'S CAR/DIRT ROAD - NIGHT 
Frank angrily swerves the car off onto a small dirt road bouncing down it, screeching to a halt near an orchard of trees.  He turns violently around to Jeffrey. 
FRANK What are you lookin' at? 
JEFFREY Nothing. 
FRANK (locks eyes with Jeffrey; long pause) Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes. (takes helium) You like me?. 
Jeffrey is quiet. 
FRANK (still high voice) Look at these. What are these? 
DOROTHY Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please. 
Frank is doing something to Dorothy's chest but Jeffrey can't see. 
FRANK Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE? 
DOROTHY Those are my breasts. 
FRANK Can I feel 'em? 
DOROTHY If you want to. 
Frank takes helium. 
FRANK Baby wants to pinch 'em. 
She winces and tries to pull away. 
FRANK (continuing) What's the matter? Give 'em back. They're just a little red, that's all. let me feel 'em again. Come here. 
Frank pulls her over and starts to pinch her again.  It really hurts her and she is frightened and in pain. 
JEFFREY Hey. leave her alone. 
Frank pretends not to hear Jeffrey and pinches Dorothy's breasts real hard. She stifles a scream.  Jeffrey gets mad.  He hits Frank hard in the face. Everyone is deadly silent as Frank turns to Jeffrey.  Frank stares at Jeffrey. 
FRANK NEXT! . out of the car fuck. HELP HIM OUT, RAYMOND!! 
160. EXT. FRANK'S CAR/DIRT ROAD - NIGHT 
Frank gets out and presses his face against the rear window.  His distorted face is hideous.  He opens the back door.  Raymond and Paul grab Jeffrey and pull him out of the car.  The Greasy Girl laughs nervously. 
DOROTHY Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it. 
FRANK Shut up. Gimme your lipstick. (takes gas) . Hey, pretty, pretty. 
Dorothy doesn't move fast enough so Frank dumps her whole purse out on the front seat and grabs the lipstick and a flashlight.  He puts lipstick heavy onto his lips. 
While Raymond and Paul hold Jeffrey.  Frank kisses Jeffrey all over the mouth.  Jeffrey tries to hit Frank and pull away, but Raymond and Paul have a hold of him.  Jeffrey looks very strange with these big blotches of red lipstick on his face and mouth. 
DOROTHY LEAVE HIM ALONE!! FRANK!! 
Frank slams the front door shut to muffle Dorothy.  He grabs Jeffrey and presses his frightened face against the front window.  Then, the back window.  Then, he flops Jeffrey up on the hood with Paul's help and presses Jeffrey's face against the rear window.  Inside the car, this show is crazy and scary.  Then, Frank takes Jeffrey over to the side of the car again. 
FRANK (to Jeffrey) You're fuckin' lucky to be alive. LOOK AT ME! 
Raymond pulls Jeffrey's face back so he's looking at Frank.  Dorothy and the Greasy Girl watch in terror. 
FRANK Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck? 
JEFFREY Yes. 
FRANK I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck! 
Frank takes a small square of blue velvet out of his pocket and begins feeling Jeffrey's face with it. 
FRANK (continuing; breathing heavily) You feel good. feel my muscles. 
Raymond makes Jeffrey raise his arm and Jeffrey feels Frank's biceps. 
FRANK (continuing) You like that? (to Raymond and Paul) Hold him tight for me. 
Suddenly Frank starts hitting Jeffrey in the face.  Dorothy screams at the car window. 
CUT TO BLACK:

DISSOLVE TO: 
173. INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
Jeffrey climbs the stairs up to Detective Williams' office. 
174. INT. ROOM 221 - POLICE STATION - DAY 
He rounds the corner and steps inside the office, when he stops short with fear.  Detective Williams is not there, but sitting at a desk next to Detective Williams' desk is the Yellow Man.  Their eyes lock. 
Jeffrey freezes. 
JEFFREY Excuse me. 
Jeffrey turns away as quickly as possible and goes over to a water cooler and gets a drink, keeping his back to the Yellow Man.  He shakes with fear.  He slowly turns around.  The Yellow Man is studying some papers on his desk. 
Again the Yellow Man looks up.  This time he is slightly suspicious and he cooks his head.  Jeffrey cannot move. 
Finally, Jeffrey is able to step away.  As he leaves the Yellow Man's line of sight, Jeffrey catches the names on the door. 
DETECTIVES J.R. WILLIAMS AND T.R. GORDON 
JEFFREY (inner voice) Gordon. Gordon. a police inspector. wait a minute. wait a minute.

178. INT. ROOM 221 - POLICE STATION - DAY 
JEFFREY (continuing, inner voice) Took all those drugs away. Gordon took those drugs away. 
CUT TO: 
179. EXT. WILLIAMS HOME - NIGHT 
Jeffrey walks through the darkness, carrying the photos.  He stops in front of Detective Williams' house and hesitates.  Jeffrey's face has a troubled look.  He approaches the front door. 
He hesitates again before finally knocking.  Detective Williams answers the door.  Sandy is in the background.  When she sees the look on Jeffrey's face, she knows why he's there. 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Jeffrey! Come on in. 
JEFFREY Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you. 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift. 
JEFFREY (with a goofy smile to Sandy) Yeah. 
180. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Sandy gives him a concerned look.  Jeffrey follows Detective Williams to his study. 
181. INT. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS STUDY - NIGHT 
He closes the door behind him. 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Okay? 
JEFFREY Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this. 
He shows him the picture of Frank and studies Detective Williams' face as he sees it. 
JEFFREY (continuing) This is Frank Booth. His address is on the back of the photo. He, in my opinion, is very sick and dangerous. This photo here is of Frank with another man as they went into Frank's apartment. 
Jeffrey casually hands the photo over and watches Detective Williams' face extra carefully.  Detective Williams doesn't flinch, yet his eyes slowly glide upwards to meet Jeffrey's. 
JEFFREY (continuing) And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son. 
JEFFREY (continuing) I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and. (he decides not to tell Detective Williams everything) . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help. 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved? 
JEFFREY I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more. 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS Is Sandy part of this? 
JEFFREY No. not at all. 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS (referring to the photos) Who knows you have these? 
JEFFREY Only you. and the photo lab. 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS You're all through with this now? 
JEFFREY Yes sir. I sure am. 
Detective Williams studies Jeffrey, then the photos. 
Jeffrey starts the car and pulls out. 
SANDY What was that all about? 
JEFFREY Nothing. really! It's good to see you. 
SANDY It's good to see you. 
JEFFREY Where to? 
SANDY Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?

Jeffrey and Sandy go downstairs to a basement which is dark and crowded with kids dancing and talking.  Jeffrey and Sandy are holding hands. Jeffrey feels a little out of place. 
A COUPLE OF GIRLS raise their eyebrows and give approving looks to Sandy. The music is loud, fast dancing music. 
SANDY You want to dance? 
JEFFREY I can't dance fast. 
SANDY Really? 
JEFFREY Really. you want to dance with someone else? 
SANDY NO. 
JEFFREY Let's wait for some slow one. 
SANDY Just a minute. 
Sandy leaves Jeffrey for a moment and Jeffrey watches her make her way through the crowd to a GIRL by the record player.  Sandy confers with the girl.  Sandy comes back to Jeffrey. 
SANDY Don't worry. I took care of it. You want something to drink? 
Just then, the music goes slow. 
JEFFREY You want to dance? 
SANDY Okay. 
They begin to dance.  At first, further apart, then, they make the mistake of looking in each other's eyes and they move very close together. They move around to another look.  Then they kiss.  They kiss for the entire rest of the song.  Between songs and during the entire next song. They finally, as they say, come up for air. 
SANDY I love you, Jeffrey. 
They kiss again.  Then they dance and look at each other.  Then they hug each other.  As they hug, Jeffrey closes his eyes. 
JEFFREY (inner voice) I really do love you.

They say goodnight to the PARENTS in the living room and leave through the front door.  They can't take their eyes off one another.  They are totally oblivious to the THREE GUYS in a car across the street. 
As soon as Jeffrey gets Sandy and himself in his car, he starts it and moves off. 
194. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT 
The dark car comes to life with a loud low roar and peels out with a scream.  It follows Jeffrey and Sandy for a way, then it roars up behind them swaying back and forth, honking its horn and trying to ram Jeffrey's car in the rear. 
Jeffrey looks frantically in the rear view mirror.  Sandy turns around in fear.  Jeffrey guns his car and races down the street. 
SANDY Oh my God. What's wrong? 
JEFFREY Frank!! 
He swerves around the corner.  Up ahead, a car is pulling out of a driveway. 
JEFFREY (continuing; referring to the car ahead) Come on. MOVE IT! 
Jeffrey swings hard around another corner and heads up a dark street, passing "Lincoln St." 
JEFFREY I can't outrun this guy. 
He floors the car and flies down another street very fast. 
JEFFREY My father has a gun at home. 
They enter the living room.  Mrs. Williams comes in from the kitchen. 
SANDY (hurrying) Is Dad home? 
MRS. WILLIAMS (shocked at sight) No. 
SANDY You better call him and get an ambulance too. 
Dorothy is clinging to Jeffrey.  Mrs. Williams goes to call. 
Sandy moves closer.  Jeffrey looks at Sandy and she returns the look. 
DOROTHY (crazy) Where have you been? (screams) Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God. 
JEFFREY It's okay. it's okay. 
DOROTHY (like a little girl) My secret lover. 
Mrs. Williams comes in. 
MRS. WILLIAMS The ambulance will be here in a minute. I left word for John. The police are on their way. 
DOROTHY (screams) Don't get the police. Oh God, ...Jeffrey I CAN'T STAND IT!! STOP IT. STOP IT. LOVE ME, 
She looks up at Mrs. Williams. 
DOROTHY (continuing) I opened myself to him. He put his disease in me. 
She presses herself tight to Jeffrey. 
DOROTHY (continuing) Tell me its okay. I opened myself to you. Okay, okay, okay, okay? 
Mrs. Williams watches with confusion and worry for the hurt this is causing Sandy.  Sandy is crying now and turns away. 
JEFFREY Sandy? ...Sandy, please. 
MRS. WILLIAMS I'll get a coat for her. 
She leaves the room hurriedly. 
SANDY (crying) Jeffrey? .What's going on? 
JEFFREY Shh. I'll tell you. 
DOROTHY (quietly) They hurt his head.

JEFFREY I promise, Dorothy. I promise. 
212. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT 
The real scene is before us.  Police cars line the street along with a huge fire truck and several ambulances.  Special police marksmen are crouched behind cars and behind a stone wall opposite Frank's building. Screams are heard from within and police radios blare.  Shots are being fired into a black window.  Once in a while a shot is returned.  Two policeman are dead and one is being loaded onto an ambulance.

JEFFREY (speaking to T.R. Gordon who doesn't hear him because he's almost dead) I'm leaving now. I'll let them find you all on their own. find all this horror on their own. (whispers) Good bye. 
He goes out and closes the door. 
215. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
The door clicks shut.  He makes his way quietly down the hall to the stairway. thinking.  He starts down the stairs. 
JEFFREY So. Frank escaped. 
He rounds the corner on a landing on the stairway and goes down another floor. and another.  At the next landing, something out the window catches his eye.  He notices a man get out of the car.  He recognizes the man. It is the well-dressed man he saw with the alligator briefcase.  Jeffrey watches the man come toward Dorothy's building.  Then his eye goes back to the man's car.  It is Frank's car.  He notices the man is carrying a police radio. 
JEFFREY (to himself) Frank's car. Is this man a cop? He has a radio!. So did Frank though and he's no cop. that's for sure. and he's driving Frank's car. who is he? 
The man enters the building at the front entrance directly below Jeffrey.

The horror and strangeness of the scene within strikes him again.  He rushes to the Yellow Man and takes the police radio out of his pocket. He runs into the back of the apartment - to the back bedroom where he crouches down behind a double bed. 
JEFFREY (into the radio) Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!! 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS (over radio) Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey? 
JEFFREY Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment. (thinks; hits himself in the forehead; inner voice) Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!! (thinks some more - fast) Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.

FRANK (calling pleasantly in the direction of the back bedroom) Hey neighbor. shit for brains. You forgot I have a police radio. I know where your cute little butt is hiding. Here I come! Ready or not! 
He starts down the hall to the back bedroom.  The police radio which Jeffrey planted under the bed and Frank's radio both start broadcasting. Frank turns his radio off - now only the one under the bed plays.

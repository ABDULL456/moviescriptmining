EXT. SPACE 
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK. . . 
INT. ARGO CITY 
AND REVEALS THE inside of a domed city honeycombed with fantastic arches. The city is inhabited by young beautiful people in luxurious but simple costumes. 
THE CAMERA ROAMS through the City, observing some people seated at a kind of cafe sipping drinks and relaxing; other people are in some kind of exercise class doing beautiful graceful movement; and finally a class of five year old children listen intently to a teacher who is demonstrating a molecular model. 
TEACHER And now, who can give me the electron wave functions for Kryptonian covalent bonding? 
The five year olds eagerly raise their hands. The teacher points to one. 
CHILD The cube root of the wavelength over the natural log of the integral of the speed of light squared. 
The teacher smiles. 
TEACHER Well, maybe that was a bit too easy... 
THE CAMERA ROAMS ON through the city, following the sound of a strange, ethereally beautiful singing. The CAMERA discovers the source of the sound: an ARTIST sculpting a beautiful crystalline object with a MATTERWAND. The wand makes the singing noise as it creates matter out of energy. The Artist, whose name is ZALTAR, sometimes whistles along in counterpoint. . 
A small girl is watching him with fascination. Her name is Kara, and she is seven. 
Behind her, the dome, which encloses the City, marks the edge of the limbo outside. 
KARA What are you making: 
ZALTAR It's going to be a tree, I think. 
KARA What's a tree? 
ZALTAR It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went. 
KARA Where is Earth? 
ZALTAR Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school? 
KARA Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head. 
Zaltar laughs. 
ZALTAR Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space. 
KARA I don't understand. 
ZALTAR Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this. 
Zaltar takes a small OMEGAHEDRON out of his pocket and holds it in his hand. 
ZALTAR. This is one of the four Power Sources of the City. I borrowed it from the Guardians. Look what I can do with it. 
Zaltar touches his MATTER.WAND to the OMEGAHEDRON and the wand instantly becomes charged with flickering light. He touches his wand to the tree sculpture---and the sculpture comes alive with dancing lights and shadows. Kara claps her hands with delight at the spectacle. Zaltar steps back and admires his handiwork. He carefully puts down the OMEGAHEDRON at his feet, takes a small flask from his belt, and drinks. 
ZALTAR You see, a tree is a living thing. 
KARA Can you create life? 
ZALTAR No, no, just the illusion of life. A kind of half-life, maybe. A pale shadow of the real thing. But it is lovely, the way the light plays over the surface. . . 
A woman's voice can be heard calling in the distance. 
WOMAN'S VOICE Kara. Kara. 
Kara calls out in reply. 
KARA I'm here, mother. 
She hands him a chicken drumstick and a hard-boiled egg. 
GEORGE Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you. 
SELENA Why George, are you proposing? 
GEORGE Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but... 
SELENA George---I thought you'd never ask. 
A shrill whistling sound from above makes them look up. With a loud plop and a spatter of icing the OMEGAHEDRON falls into the middle of the chocolate cake. 
GEORGE What the heck is that? 
They look up in the boughs of the tree overhead, and then down at the chocolate cake splashed all over the checked cloth. 
SELENA A squirrel Frisbee? 
Selena reaches out and picks up the OMEGAHEDRON. It comes away from the cake without a trace of the chocolate icing sticking to its surface, as if made of some substance, which repels other kinds of matter. 
Selena holds the shining Omegahedron in her hand and examines it, turning it around and around as if hypnotized. Her face takes on a new expression. Almost as if the simple, wholesome innocence of her nature had been blasted away by some profound new knowledge of the universe. 
SELENA That's funny. I'd swear I know just what this is, but I've never seen it before. 
She stands up and walks across the checkered cloth, in a beeline for the pickup truck. 
GEORGE Hey, where you going? 
SELENA (calling over her shoulder) I've got things to do. 
GEORGE What about my proposal? 
SELENA (dismissively) Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch. 
She gets in the pickup and. drives away. 
GEORGE Hey! My truck! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
KARA' S FACE 
She is ten years older now, a young lady. Almost ready to assume the long flowing gown of an adult, but still in the tunic worn by those under eighteen. 
ALURA (voice over) But Kara, you are too young to go. 
ANOTHER ANGLE. ARGO CITY. DIMMED 
They are in the assembly amphitheater of the city, where the kindergarten nuclear physics class was seen. Kara is in the centre of the ring, with adults seated in scattered rows around her. Her parents Zor-El and Alura are standing in front of her. 
KARA I am almost an adult. This is what I want. 
ZOR-EL But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous. 
KARA It was my fault we lost the Power Source. 
ZOR-EL Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it. 
KARA I allowed it to escape the City. 
ALURA Ever since we told you how your cousin Superman was sent there as an infant, all you have wanted to do was visit this place. 
KARA Yes, I do want to go. But someone must go. Our scanning shows the Power Source has finally reached the Earth. It could destroy everything unless someone brings it back. 
ZOR-EL Superman will return it. 
KARA Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl- 
KARA I'll have super powers there. Like him. We can't wait. Our lights are fading. Look around you. When I was a child the City was bright and shining. Look at it now. 
Zor-El and Alura sigh. There is no denying that the brilliance of Argo City has been much dimmed since Kara was a little girl. 
ALURA What do your teachers think? 
Zor-El looks around the circle. A beautiful woman speaks. 
TEACHER It would be sad to lose one of our finest young ones to the dimension barrier-- but the City cannot last much longer without the Power Source. It is her future she's fighting for, Zor-El. 
LINDA I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it. 
MR. DANVERS Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here. 
He rises and walks around the desk toward her. He puts his hand on her shoulder in a fatherly fashion. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CAMPUS. DORM 
MR. Danvers is carrying her suitcase as he shows her around the campus. 
MR DANVERS ...since your school records were lost in the fire, we'11 start you out easy first. You'll have English, Latin, French, History, Art, Chemistry, Math, Biology and Computing. Later on, you can add some electives. I think we'll put you in "G" dorm. 
He opens the door and ushers her into the dorm. 
INT. DORM. CORRIDOR 
MR. Danvers leads Linda down the corridor. 
A girl dorm monitor sees him and yells out the traditional signal. 
STUDENT MONITOR Man on the floor! 
Immediately, several of the room doors along the corridor slam shut. MR. Danvers smiles indulgently and leads Linda along to one of the rooms with an open door. 
INT. DORM ROOM 
LUCY LANE, still in her softball flannels, is digging mud out of her cleats with a Swiss Army Knife held over a wastebasket. MR. Danvers knocks on the open door, in the pre-entry signal of Earth. Lucy looks up. 
LUCY Oh, MR. Danvers, come in and park it. 
MR. DANVERS Lucy, your roommate still home with anorexia? 
LUCY It wasn't anorexia. It was the food. 
MR DANVERS Linda, this is Lucy Lane. You can room with her. Show her around, Lucy; I believe you know her cousin, MR., uh, Kent. Lucy turns into a bundle of enthusiasm. She grabs Linda's suitcase and leads her into the room chattering away excitedly. 
LUCY Wow, you're Clark's cousin?? Fabuloso! Clark's a hunk. My sister Lois was a real nerd to let that one get away. You'll love it here, we have a great dorm, some really insane characters, I mean radical craziness... 
MR. Danvers slips away, leaving the two new roommates to get acquainted. 
Lucy puts Linda's suitcase on the bare mattress of the empty bed and opens the dresser drawers to help her unpack. 
LINDA I can do that. 
LUCY No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving? 
She looks down at the nearly empty suitcase. LINDA There isn't any. 
LUCY This is all your clothes? 
Lucy involuntarily glances over her shoulder at the bulging closet beside. her own bed. Lucy's bed is smothered with teddy bears, and the walls around it are covered with photos and posters of male rock singers, movie stars, and tennis players. Also a large painted poster of SUPERMAN. 
LINDA I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since... 
LUCY Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something? 
LINDA I'd rather not talk about it. 
LUCY You're not...an orphan are you? 
LINDA My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth. 
LUCY Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time. 
LINDA Thank you. You're very kind. 
LUCY I'm real sorry, Linda, I should've known it was something tragic if you show up without a wardrobe. Here, try on this. And this. 
Lucy starts pulling clothes out of her closet and tossing to Linda. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SCHOOL PLAYING FIELDS. DAY 
Girls in their adorable school gym outfits run around playing field hockey. Linda hangs back on the outskirts of the mob. She sees Myra put her stick between Lucy's legs and trip her. Linda stops to help Lucy up. 
MR. DANVERS You may go, Linda. But try not to clown around in the future. 
She meekly heads for the door. He turns to erase the blackboard. Something stays his hand, and he looks at the problem. Then he puts down the eraser and starts to copy the problem on a piece of paper. 
EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE SCHOOL. DAY 
Selena's Cadillac drives past the school. softball in front. Girls are playing softball in front. 
INT. CADILLAC 
Bianca is driving. Selena sits in the back brooding. Her tarot cards and the metal gargoyle box are beside her on the open counter of a  built-in bar. She suddenly calls out to Bianca. 
SELENA Stop the car! 
Bianca jams on the brakes and the car screeches to a halt. 
EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE SCHOOL 
The girls stop their softball game and turn to stare at the Cadillac. 
INT. CADILLAC 
Selena is gathering up her scattered things from the floor of the car. 
SELENA I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall. 
BIANCA What is it? 
SELENA The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it. 
The metal gargoyle box is glowing with an inner radiance. 
SELENA What does it mean? 
BIANCA The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near . 
They stare out the car window at the girls' softball game, which was resumed. 
SELENA Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game? 
BIANCA Softball. 
SELENA It must be the girls. One of the girls. 
BIANCA But which one? 
SELENA Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention. 
Bianca starts up the car again and drives smoothly away. 
SELENA We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out. 
BIANCA And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy! 
The car swerves slightly. 
SELENA Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK? 
BIANCA Sorry, mistress. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DORM. DAY 
Linda is standing at the bathroom' window of her dorm room, looking outside with a melancholy expression. She slides the curtain across the window, so no one can see in. 
INT. LINDA AND LUCY'S ROOM. DAY 
Lucy runs in, fresh from her softball game, and sits down on the bed as usual to dig the mud out of her cleats. Lucy's bed is still a riot of stuffed animals and frilly lace pillows. Linda's bed' across the room is austere and almost monastic, with no family photos, posters, or toys. 
LUCY Hey, Linda, you in there? 
LINDA (o.s.) Uh-huh. 
Linda answers from inside the shut bathroom door. LUCY How much longer you gonna be? 
LINDA (o.s.) Not long. I'm cutting my hair. 
CUT TO: 
INT. OFFICE IN THE MATH DEPARTMENT 
Mr. Danvers sits at his computer, which is spewing out page after page of a complicated printout. Finally the printer stops. He reads out the bottom line. 
MR . DANVERS Five billion, two hundred and seventy-one million, nine thousand, and ten. 
He sits back in his chair and puffs thoughtfully on his pipe. 
EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS. BENCH. DAY. LATER 
The campus is deserted. Linda still pretends to read, but her sense of loneliness is palpable. Suddenly Mr. Danvers is beside her, looking down. 
MR. DANVERS No plans for the weekend, Linda? 
LINDA No, MR. Danvers. 
MR. DANVERS Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner? 
LINDA I'd love to. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BACKYARD OF DANVERS'S HOUSE. DAY 
Mr. & Mrs. Danvers and Linda sit outside under the trees at a table piled high with delicious home cooked food. ,The dog begs for scraps. As the scene progresses (MOS) the Danvers bring Linda out of her shyness until they all laugh together sharing food, jokes and happiness. A. dreamlike moment of nostalgia from everyone's childhood. 
INT. SELENA'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY 
Selena, at her most glamorous, in silk hostess pajamas and scads of pearls, stands looking out the French, doors of her mansion. She is staring shamelessly at ETHAN, a handsome young landscape gardener. Bianca is standing beside Selena. 
BIANCA Is he your entertainment for tonight? 
SELENA He will be. In about five minutes. 
BIANCA Have fun. 
Bianca exits, and Selena waves to Ethan from the French doors. 
EXT. SELENA'S HOUSE. GARDEN. DAY. 
Ethan is sketching the house, adding new trees and shrubs in his drawing. He sees Selena waving, and walks over to her. 
INT. SELENA'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY 
SELENA Finished your estimate? 
ETHAN Well, there's several ways to go . 
SELENA Come in, have a drink, we'll talk. 
She ushers him inside and sits him down in front of the vast hearth. 
SELENA You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around. 
ETHAN I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service. 
SELENA I bet they do. 
ETHAN What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire. 
SELENA Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage. 
Ethan spreads his drawings out on his knees. 
ETHAN Now we could put in rhododendrons or lilacs...depending on how alkaline your soil is. 
Selena gives a cursory glance at the sketch, and then turns to a silver tray beside her. She picks up a frosty pitcher and pours an iced fruit drink into two tall glasses. 
SELENA I just love plants and growing things. It must be wonderful to have green thumbs. Cheers! 
Ethan looks at the drink with misgiving. 
ETHAN Uh, no thanks, I don't drink during the day. 
Selena gestures outside. SELENA But look, it's almost sundown! 
SELENA Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself. 
Selena closes the door while he's off his guard. Nigel takes a pocket mirror out of his shoulder bag and stares with horror at his reflection. His face is erupting all over in ugly red blotches. 
NIGEL Nasty bitch! 
EXT. GROUNDS OF SELENA'S MANSION. SUNSET 
Ethan staggers across the lawn, still clutching his head, obviously very ill. As he disappears through the shrubbery on the far side of the lawn, he mutters drunkenly to himself. 
ETHAN Rhododendron.. . .honeysuckle. . . 
INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM 
Selena enters and finds Ethan gone. She is furious. She walks to the French doors. 
SELENA Ethan. Come back. You'll spoil everything! INT. THE DANVERS' LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 
Linda is playing chess with MR. Danvers, while his wife knits on the sofa. 
MRS. DANVERS I think you'd better be getting back to the dorm, Linda. The housemother'll expect you to sign in by eight. 
Linda stands up from the chessboard. 
LINDA Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers. 
MR. DANVERS What? Me? 
LINDA Sure. Mate in five moves. 
She moves the pieces chonk, chonk, chonk, chonk, chonk... 
LINDA ...and there goes my king. Got to hand it to you, I didn't see it coming. Well, bye. 
She walks out the door into the night. 
MRS . DANVERS What a lovely child. Such nice manners. We must have her back, don't you think? 
MR. Danvers 'grunts absent-mindedly, bemused at his loss. 
INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 
Selena paces agitatedly in her living room. Finally she stops in front of the ornate mirror hanging on the wall. She puts her hand on the heavy veil covering it. 
SELENA Show me Ethan. 
She rips aside the veil. The IMAGE IN THE MIRROR SHOWS ETHAN STAGGERING DRUNKENLY THROUGH THE NIGHT COWN THE CENTRE WHITE LINE OF A HIGHWAY. CARS WHIZZ PAST HIM IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. 
SELENA The silly fool! EXT. HAMBURGER HEAVEN. NIGHT 
Lucy is in front of the local hamburger drive-in in her Thunderbird convertible, talking to the foxiest dude at Rindge Tech. Other teens are hanging out and listening to rock music outside the drive-in. Lucy catches sight of Linda walking along the side of the road. 
LUCY Hey, Linda! (to the boy) It's my roommate. You'll love her. She's really off the wall! 
Lucy jumps out of her car, runs over to Linda, and whispers urgently in her ear. 
LUCY Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away... 
LINDA Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight. 
LUCY Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you. 
LINDA It doesn't seem right. 
LUCY Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl? 
Linda catches sight of a figure teetering down the centre, white line of the highway. Cars honk and zoom past him. 
LINDA Look at that guy! 
Lucy whirls around and looks. 
LUCY What a space cadet. (yelling and waving) Hey, you dingleberry! Get outta the street! 
Ethan ignores them, and continues to teeter deliriously. 
INSERT.  ETHAN'S P.O.V. 
INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM 
Selena watches the image of Ethan and Supergirl in her mirror. Her face is a study in jealousy and dismay. 
ETHAN (in the mirror) God...you're beautiful. 
SELENA That was meant for me! 
EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE/GAS STATION. BULLDOZER. RING OF FIRE 
SUPERGIRL Thank you. I'm going to close this up again. 
ETHAN Wait...don't leave me in here... 
SUPERGIRL It's for your own protection. 
She pulls the massive steel jaws shut and tears the scoop off the bulldozer with a sound of rending metal. Immediately afterwards, the flames reach the underground storage tank and the bulldozer is enveloped in a FIERY EXPLOSION. 
EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE. OUTSIDE RING OF FIRE. NIGHT 
The entire gas station is a column of flame and black smoke reaching up into the night sky. A fire truck and a police car arrive on the scene, sirens screaming. The tourist family watch from a safe distance, their toddler clapping his hands excitedly at the spectacle. 
EXT. IN THE SKY. HIGH ABOVE THE ACCIDENT. NIGHT 
Supergirl flies out of the column of black smoke, carrying the sealed bulldozer scoop with Ethan and Lucy safely inside. 
ETHAN (calling from inside) What's happening? 
SUPERGIRL (shouting over the wind) I'm taking you to the hospital. 
ETHAN (within) Let me out. I have to talk to you. 
SUPERGIRL Later. 
EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE. POST FIRE. NIGHT 
The firemen have smothered the fire with a blanket of foam. The blackened bulldozer minus its front scoop stands next to the smashed station wagon. A bewildered policeman is searching for victims. 
POLICEMAN Where's the casualties? You can't tell me there's no casualties. 
INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 
Bianca enters and sees Selena staring raptly at the mirror. BIANCA I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger? 
SELENA It's what we were warned about. 
Selena points to the mirror, which shows the IMAGE OF SUPERGIRL FLYING THROUGH THE AIR CARRYING THE BULLDOZER SCOOP. Bianca can't quite make out what it is at first. 
BIANCA A Storm Dragon? 
SELENA No, a super girl. 
EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. NIGHT 
Supergirl lands with the bulldozer scoop in front of the emergency entrance. There is no one around. Supergirl rips open the sealed scoop with a loud noise of rending metal. 
INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM. NIGHT 
TWO INTERNS are chatting in the corridor near the doors. They jump at the sound of bending steel outside. 
FIRST INTERN What was that? 
SECOND INTERN Maybe we better take a look. 
EXT . HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. NIGHT 
Supergirl has strapped Ethan and the semi-conscious Lucy onto wheeled gurneys. 
ETHAN Don't leave me. 
SUPERGIRL I have to. 
ETHAN When can I see, you again ? 
SUPERGIRL Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye. 
She gives the gurneys a shove. 
BIANCA Whatever you say. 
SELENA Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on. 
She shuts the lid of the gargoyle box, sealing the spinning OMEGAHEDRON safely inside. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DANVERS ' LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 
Mrs. Danvers is on the phone. 
MRS. DANVERS The housemother still doesn't answer. 
Mrs. Danvers hangs up the phone with a worried expression. 
MR. DANVERS Probably drunk again. I'm sure Linda got back all right. 
MRS. DANVERS We should have driven her. 
Mr. Danvers stands up and puts on his jacket. 
MR. DANVERS I'll just drop by the school and. make sure she's all right. 
EXT. MIDVALE SCHOOL. DESERTED CAMPUS. OUTSIDE THE DORM. NIGHT 
Linda drives up in Lucy's car, the one left behind at the scene of the accident outside the hamburger place. She drives past the paddle tennis court and parks in front of the dorm. Linda gets out of the car, and lets herself into the dorm with a key. Inside, she signs her name in the book. , 
INT. DORM CORRIDOR. NIGHT 
Linda walks down the long dormitory corridor past room after empty room. The place is kind of spooky. 
INT. LINDA'S ROOM. NIGHT 
Linda enters the room she shares with Lucy. She puts Lucy's car keys on her bedside table next to the snapshots of  Lucy's family and of her half-dozen current boyfriends. Linda turns and crosses the room to her own monastic bed in its drab, undecorated corner. She lies down on her bed with a sigh, staring at the ceiling in a melancholy mood. 
Suddenly, she senses that something is not right. She gets up from the bed, walks to the window, and gazes out a-t the deserted campus. 
EXT. OUTSIDE DORM. TENNIS COURT. NIGHT. 
The dorm is set apart from other school buildings and surrounded by tall trees. The tennis court is visible from Linda's window, and a city park adjoining the school property. The UNSEEN MONSTER is heard approaching through the park with a thud of heavy footfalls and the crack of snapping tree trunks and branches. A bolt of lightning flashes, followed by a crash of thunder. The wind howls. A storm is brewing. 
Far away across the campus something huge and powerful forces itself between the two big oaks, snapping them like matchsticks. The unseen monster hauls its enormous bulk toward the dormitory, crushing everything in its path, its footsteps making the ground tremble like an earthquake. 
INT. LINDA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 
Linda watches with uncomprehending eyes the approaching swath of destruction heading straight for her. Nothing she has learned about this strange alien world has prepared" her for this. For the first time since she left Argo City, her eyes show fear. And yet there's a deeper streak of defiance in her that impels her to stand her ground and face the horrible juggernaut. 
EXT. FORM. TENNIS COURT. CAMPUS. NIGHT 
HUGE FOOTPRINTS sink into the damp grass of the campus. A bicycle rack full of Schwinns is flattened into the dirt with a metallic screech. The monster proceeds inexorably toward the wooden rain shelter on one side of the tennis court. The shelter is crushed to kindling wood. The monster drags its enormous unseen bulk across the smooth clay surface of the tennis court, crunching , deep cracked depressions in the clay. The net stretches and groans toward Linda as the' invisible enormity comes closer, and finally snaps with a loud twanging sound as the steel cables part. The tall cyclone fence bulges outward toward Linda and momentarily outlines the form of" the monster before it crumples and falls with the screech of twisted steel. The only thing between Linda and the monster is Lucy.' s parked car. The monster stomps the car flat with a noise like colliding express trains and heads for Linda. 
INT. LINDA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 
LINDA Hey, that's my roommate's car! 
Determination floods her face. She whips off her brunette wig and her civilian clothing to reveal the blonde hair and red blue tunic of SUPERGIRL! 
EXT. OUTSIDE THE DORM. NIGHT 
Supergirl flies out the dorm window and lands in front of the unseen monster. She raises her hand in challenge and calls out in a commanding voice. 
SUPERGIRL Leave this place and do no harm. 
Something picks Supergirl up and flings her against the wall of the dorm, crushing the soft drink dispenser under her and squirting cola in every direction. Lightning flashes and thunder booms overhead. Supergirl picks herself up, shaken. 
She launches herself directly at the space in mid-air ten feet above the monster's footprints. She crashes into something hard and invisible with the sound of a tremendous impact. Supergirl falls to the ground, staggered by the concussion. The irresistible force has met the immovable object. Supergirl looks up, and---altering the wavelength of her X-Ray vision to a transcendental frequency---paints this beam over the monster and just for an instant makes it visible: a HUGE NIGHTMARE SHAPE LOOMING OVER HER, AND REACHING OUT TO CRUSH HER WITH MASSIVE TALONS. Then the image fades. 
Supergirl is seized again and flung against the school flagpole, breaking it off at the base. Supergirl stands up and seizes the flagpole. She looks up at the flickering lightning in the sky. She flies straight upward into the storm with the bare flagpole held in front of her. 
EXT. THUNDER STORM. LIGHTNING 
Again and again huge bolts of lightning strike the flagpole. Supergirl's face is contorted with agony as her body absorbs enough electricity to run Las Vegas for a year. She looks down and sees through a break in the clouds the campus far below. 
EXT. CAMPUS 
Suddenly Supergirl dives down from the sky, glowing with accumulated electricity. She embraces the monster with a tremendous crackle of energy. The two of them are bathed in brilliant arc light. The monster is briefly made visible again by the energy. But this time it is shrinking, shriveling up into a shapeless lump. The light fades as the energy is discharged. A dark, shapeless lump detaches itself from Supergirl's grasp and flies shrieking away into the night. Supergirl stands alone and exhausted, her muscles trembling with fatigue. 
She shakes hands shyly with Jimmy, then turns to Lucy. 
LINDA I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car. 
LUCY Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D. 
Jimmy keeps looking at Linda. 
JIMMY Do you have any theories about last night? 
LINDA Theories? 
JIMMY How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- - 
LUCY (overlapping) Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second? 
JIMMY -- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural? 
LINDA I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is. 
JIMMY Can I quote you? 
Lucy hands Jimmy a stainless steel urinal. 
LUCY Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die? 
JIMMY Oh, sure. 
He steps into Lucy's bathroom with the urinal and fills it with water from her shower. Lucy grabs Linda's arm and whispers urgently in her ear. 
LUCY Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop. 
LINDA He's nice. 
LUCY Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead! 
Jimmy emerges from the bathroom with his daffodils neatly arranged in the stainless steel jug. 
JIMMY Where is your cousin Clark, by the way? 
LINDA He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation. 
JIMMY I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop ! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HOSPITAL. ENTRANCE. LATE AFTERNOON 
Bianca drives Selena's Cadillac up to the emergency entrance and parks in the ambulance zone. Selena get out of the back seat in a dramatic opera cape of raw silk with opal trim. 
SELENA (to Bianca) This won't take long. Keep the motor running. 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. LATE AFTERNOON 
Selena strides down the hospital corridor almost as if she is floating an inch above the floor. Her huge silk cape billows around her, making her seem larger-than-life. Nurses, orderlies, patients scatter to get out of her way. Her presence is so formidable and she moves so fast and inexorably that no one has a chance to stop her and inquire what she's doing there. She knows exactly where she's going to. She turns a corner, and steps inside an open door and closes it behind her. 
INT. ETHAN'S ROOM. DAY 
He is sitting in bed, an ice bag on his head, drawing a picture of Supergirl on a piece of cardboard. He is in pajamas and robe. 
Selena steps beside the bed. He looks up. 
ETHAN Oh no, not you again. 
SELENA What an adorable hat. 
ETHAN They think I have a concussion. 
SELENA And you think you're in love. 
ETHAN I know it. 
SELENA This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion. 
ETHAN Why should I believe you? 
SELENA It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl. 
A team of surgeons and nurses are bent over a patient on the table. Ethan runs through in the background. The surgeons continue with their work. The heart-lung machine wheels through after him, followed by the scalpels flying through the air like a swarm of hornets. 
The surgical team doesn't look up from their work. 
Several cylinders of anesthetic gas tear themselves loose from the wall and trundle away out of the room after Ethan and the other apparatus. One of the nurses finally looks up. 
NURSE Doctor, I think you' re going to have a gas problem. 
DOCTOR I shouldn't have had the cabbage at lunch. 
INT. X-RAY ROOM 
Ethan bursts into an empty surgical X-Ray room---the pursuing apparatus visible a few yards behind. He slams the heavy lead-lined door and bolts it shut. 
He hears the thud of the apparatus beating impotently against the door. He leans against the door panting, his cotton hospital gown and robe soaked with cold sweat. Suddenly, with a whir of motors, the giant multi-armed C.A.T. SCANNER behind him comes to life, its lights glowing, and reaches out its chrome steel arms toward him. 
Ethan yells, runs across the room, climbs on a gurney, rips a metal grill off the wall, and dives into the air conditioning duct. 
INT. DUCT 
Ethan scrambles noisily along inside the metal duct as if all the fiends of hell were after him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LUCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM 
Lucy is showing off the controls of her bed. The door opens. Lucy, Jimmy and Linda look with amazement at what's outside in the corridor. 
LUCY Omigod. 
A DELIVERY BOY enters with A SPECTACULAR FLORAL ARRANGEMENT. 
DELIVERY BOY Where you want this? 
LUCY Over by the window. It must be from my sister. Give him a tip, Jimmy. 
Jimmy is acutely aware how pathetic his daffodils look as he fumbles in his pocket for a dollar for the delivery boy. Suddenly overhead there is a loud banging and clattering from the air-conditioning duct. Everyone looks up at the ceiling with alarm. But Linda's X-RAY VISION lets her alone recognize Ethan. 
JIMMY Gosh, what do you suppose .that is? 
LINDA Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy. 
LUCY You're not gonna stay for the ice cream? 
LINDA I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers. 
LUCY Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming. 
Her phone rings and she picks it up. 
LUCY Phillip! When are you gonna come see me? 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR 
Linda walks out of Lucy's room and quickly down the corridor. Jimmy hurries to catch up with her. 
JIMMY Can I give you a lift? 
LINDA Oh, no thanks. 
JIMMY It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions. 
Linda's heart sinks as she realises she doesn't know how to get rid of him politely. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL SUNSET 
Ethan batters the top off a ventilator and crawls out onto the roof. He turns and quickly replaces the aluminum top, bashing it firmly closed with his fist. He straightens up, sweat-soaked, bedraggled, haggard and exhausted, looking like an escaped lunatic with his disheveled hair and his torn hospital robe. He heaves a sigh of relief, and turns to see Selena standing behind him, her silk cape billowing in the breeze. 
SELENA Give up? 
Ethan  takes a beat to make sure he's not hallucinating, then he summons new reserves of strength and runs over to the TALL BRICK SMOKESTACK from the hospital's incinerator. 
ETHAN Never! 
He starts to climb up the steel ladder on the side of the chimney. 
JIMMY There goes my Pulitzer Prize. 
Linda steps around to the other side of his car. Bianca is staring up at the chimney from the driver's seat of the Cadillac. She doesn't see Linda lift up a sewer grating with her toe and drop noiselessly and suddenly out of sight into the storm drain below. 
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND HOSPITAL 
A red and blue streak bursts upwards out of another storm drain. The iron cover flips off and lands with a clang as Supergirl flies skyward toward the roof. 
EXT. TOP OF CHIMNEY 
Ethan's grip fails and he falls. 
EXT. CHIMNEY. SKY 
Supergirl appears, snatches Ethan in mid-air, and flies off with him into the clouds above. 
EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL 
Selena reacts with relief---then, realizing who has saved him, her face clouds with resentment. 
EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY 
Jimmy Olsen's magazine pops open and film unspools out of his camera as his motor drive whirrs. 
JIMMY Darn! 
He turns to Bianca, who is looking up in the sky from beside the Cadillac. 
JIMMY Hey lady, did you see that? 
Bianca gives him a glance of contempt. 
BIANCA See what? 
JIMMY The girl---dressed like Superman--caught that guy in mid-air. 
BIANCA Really? Maybe you should check into the hospital and have your head examined. 
EXT. HIGH IN THE AIR ABOVE THE HOSPITAL. SUNSET 
Supergirl carries Ethan beside her, her arm tight around his upper chest, his arm over her shoulders. They are above the clouds bathed in the rich warm glow of sunset. He looks at her ecstatically, his eyes drunk with love. 
ETHAN You're alive! She didn't kill you! 
SUPERGIRL Who didn't? 
ETHAN That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you. 
SUPERGIRL You love me? 
ETHAN My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms... 
SUPERGIRL We have to have a long talk about all this. 
ETHAN I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower. 
EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY. TWILIGHT 
Selena comes striding out 'of the hospital, scowling. Jimmy Olsen notices her, and senses her aura of power. He drops his useless Nikon into his camera bag and starts rummaging for another camera. 
BIANCA Home? 
SELENA No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me. 
BIANCA (shrewdly) Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener? 
Selena looks at Bianca with wounded dignity. 
SELENA I use men, but I'm not addicted to them. I can quit whenever I want. 
She gets in the back seat of the car, just as Jimmy Olsen snaps a photo of her with a Polaroid. Selena slams the car door and Bianca drives off. Jimmy examines the instant photo he just took. His eyes widen with wonder and the hair prickles on the back of his neck as he sees the image. 
INSERT: THE POLAROID IN JIMMY'S HAND. THE PICTURE OF SELENA ENTERING HER CAR, BUT BEHIND HER THERE IS A HIDEOUS LOOMING SHADOW---MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN NIGEL SHOWED IT TO HER. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK. NIGHT 
ETHAN You're not afraid are you? 
SUPERGIRL Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand. 
ETHAN If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school. 
SUPERGIRL Well...I guess one is all right. 
She closes her eyes, parts her lips, and leans forward. 
SUPERGIRL Is this how? 
ETHAN Terrific. 
Their lips meet. Zowie. 
SELENA What a touching scene! 
Her voice is like having a bucket of ice water dashed over you. Ethan and Supergirl pull apart. The Ferris wheel has carried them all the way around and back down again. Selena is standing beside them. Supergirl stands up and steps boldly out of the gondola to confront her. 
SUPERGIRL Who are you ? 
SELENA I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry. 
SUPERGIRL I don't scare that easily. 
Selena rummages down deep in her handbag and pulls out the gargoyle box. 
SELENA All right, Miss Know-it-all. If I can't have him, nobody can. 
She holds the gargoyle box out toward the Ferris wheel. 
SELENA Coffer of Shadow, show your Power! 
INSERT C.U. OF THE BOLTS HOLDING ETHAN'S GONDOLA TO THE FERRIS WHEEL: THE BOLTS UNSCREW AND FALL OUT. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Ethan yells as his gondola falls off the Ferris wheel and down onto the tent, which covers the DODGEM CARS. 
INT. DODGEM CARS TENT 
He falls through the tent and onto the electrified floor below. The wooden gondola shatters on impact. Ethan sits up, dazed by the fall, and sees a dodgem car painted like the face of a vicious football player heading toward him. Ethan scrambles away on his hands and knees. Another hideously painted car attacks him, and another, and another. He dodges and scuttles around desperately. Finally he manages to climb aboard one of the cars. 
EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK 
Supergirl reaches out to seize Selena. But Selena holds up the gargoyle box and is surrounded by an impenetrable, glowing shield of force. Supergirl tries to push through, the shield in vain. 
Supergirl flies to the little fence made out of steel spikes surrounding the Haunted House. At super speed she rips up the entire line of fence posts and hurls them like javelins at Selena. 
Selena dissolves her force field and tries to run away, ducking and dodging the rain of javelins. She turns too quickly and the GARGOYLE BOX slips out of her hand and rolls underneath the deck of the carousel. Selena moans with despair, and pauses, reluctant to leave without the box. This is the opportunity Supergirl needs. The fence posts bury themselves in the ground in a perfect circle around Selena---effectively imprisoning her. 
SUPERGIRL That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while. 
SELENA A cheap trick. 
SUPERGIRL Cheap but effective. 
INT. DODGEM CAR TENT 
Ethan is holding on to his car desperately as all the other cars viciously ram into it. Suddenly his car is lifted up, carried through a hole in the tent roof, and off into the night sky. 
ETHAN Supergirl'? 
He looks under the car. There she is, carrying him to safety. She smiles reassuringly. 
EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK 
Selena is trapped inside the ring of posts, fumbling in her bag. One by one she takes out dried herbs, feathers, dusts, and flings them at the bars while she shouts magic word. Nothing works. 
SELENA Yookoohoo! No, that's not it. Sis-o-reb! Nope. Ka-ma-hoochie! 
Bianca appears out of the shadows. Selena looks up, embarrassed. 
BIANCA Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you. 
SELENA Shut up, and get me a hacksaw. 
SELENA Let us begin. I invoke the rule of seven. 
OTHERS IN UNISON The Circle is complete. 
NIGEL You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena. 
SELENA We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft. 
INDIAN WOMAN But Superman has been away. 
SELENA It is not Superman I speak of, but his cousin Kara. She knows we exist.. 
ELDERLY MAN Then she must be destroyed. 
NIGEL How did she find out about us? 
ELDERLY MAN That is unimportant. Now that she knows, she will become curious and learn more. When she learns we plan to restore the ancient religion of this planet and avenge the centuries of persecution---she will try to stop us. 
BIANCA We must destroy her first. 
ERICA But how can we destroy her? 
SELENA By the Rite of Ultimate Power. One person must volunteer  to take on the combined power of us all. 
Nigel stands up and points an accusing finger at Selena. 
NIGEL You! You want to take our power for yourself! 
Selena reacts calmly, speaking in low, modulated tones, as if to an overstimulated child. 
SELENA Nige1, you know the one who takes on Ultimate Power must sacrifice the last sparks of her own spirit. 
Selena takes hold of a golden chain hanging around her neck and draws out a little glass vial attached to it. Inside the glass vial a tiny spark glows brightly. 
SELENA (continuing) Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice? 
NIGEL You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power. 
SELENA Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel? 
NIGEL Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart. 
SELENA Nonsense. 
Nigel pulls aside the heavy veil covering her mirror. 
FOR AN INSTANT SELENA SEES HER REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR. BEHIND HER LOOMS THE DARK, EVIL PRESENCE, INVISIBLE TO THE OTHERS IN THE ROOM, AND MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN SHE GLIMPSED IT AT HER GARDEN PARTY. 
Then Bianca leaps to the mirror and pulls the veil back across it. Bianca stands challenging Nigel, daring him to try again. Selena looks at the gargoyle-shaped Coffer of Shadow, sitting beside her hearth. It too seems much larger than when we last saw it at the hospital. Selena wonders for a beat if maybe Nigel is right. Can the Shadow be ruling her? 
BIANCA Enough quibbling. Let us vote. 
They all draw their sacred white-handled knives out of concealment in their clothing. Nigel defiantly places his on the floor with its blade pointing inward. Then one by one, the others put down their knives with the blades pointing outward. They all look at Nigel. His shoulders sag with dejection. 
SELENA I invoke the rule of seven. Do you agree? 
Nigel speaks with the voice of someone pronouncing his own death sentence. 
NIGEL I have no choice. 
His knife turns by itself on the floor until its blade points outward. Everyone joins hands in the circle. A fire springs to life on the hearth. Someone starts to chant in a strange ancient tongue. Slowly the heavy, opulent living room begins to change: the carpet becomes the floor of an ancient stone temple with dark brown stains splattered across its massive granite blocks, the walls start to melt away. Outside the windows the dark night is replaced by hot, brutal sunlight pounding down on an endless desert stretching away to the horizon. 
The house completely dissolves and is replaced by monumental stone ruins. The smoky fire crackles and sends its dark plumes boiling skyward. The only thing remaining of Selena's house is the hearth and the Coffer of Shadow. Selena stands up And walks out of the centre of the circle toward the Coffer. She opens the lid. She pulls the glass vial off the golden chain around her neck and drops it into the Coffer. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TROPICAL BEACH. DAY 
Ethan wanders along the beach with Supergirl, holding hands. She stops to pick up a seashell. Ethan clutches his head as if he has a sudden violent headache, moans, and collapses on the sand. Supergirl kneels beside him. 
SUPERGIRL Ethan, what IS wrong? 
Ethan opens his eyes and looks at her. He speaks in a voice of bleak despair. 
ETHAN She said it wouldn't last. 
SUPERGIRL What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you? 
SUPERGIRL I don't see why not. 
ETHAN But what if---it wasn't real? 
SUPERGIRL Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever. 
Ethan's face lights up. The future begins to exist for him again. 
ETHAN Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think? 
SUPERGIRL Are you asking me for a "date"? 
ETHAN Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available. 
SUPERGIRL Aren't you forgetting about Selena? 
ETHAN She'll forget about us eventually. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM 
In the polished surface of her mirror, Selena makes a scene appear: Ethan and Supergirl on the tropical island. 
SUPERGIRL (image) There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil... 
ETHAN (image) I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TROPIAL ISLAND 
Supergirl becomes very excited. 
SUPERGIRL That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live? 
ETHAN In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there. 
SUPERGIRL I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park. 
She stands up. 
ETHAN Wait. Don't leave me. 
SUPERGIRL You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source. 
He stands up and takes her hand. 
ETHAN Before you go... 
SUPERGIRL What? 
ETHAN Just one kiss. For old times' sake. 
SUPERGIRL And you can see how you feel about me, right? 
ETHAN Yes. 
She closes her eyes and parts her lips. Slowly their lips come together and touch. Then a sudden rush of sheer desire flows through them and the simple experimental kiss become an ecstatic prelude to the heights of lovemaking. But before either one of them can go one step further, ETHAN DISAPPEARS WITH A FLASH OF BLINDING WHITE LIGHT. A cloud darkens the sun, and the trees are lashed into a frenzy by gale-force winds. Selena's laughter can be heard from somewhere far away. 
SUPERGIRL Ethan! 
Supergirl flies into the air. 
EXT. TROPICAL ISLAND. SUNSET. SKY ABOVE ISLAND. DAY 
Supergirl flies around the island very fast at high speed, searching for Ethan and Selena. She hovers like an eagle for a moment, then speeds straight upwards. 
EXT. ABOVE THE OCEAN. DAY 
Supergirl flies back to North America, faster than she has ever flown before. 
EXT. ABOVE MIDVALE. DAY 
Supergirl zeros in on Selena's house like an exocet. 
EXT. SELENA'S FRONT LAWN 
Supergirl lands and walks toward the towering French doors of the living room. But something distracts her. She turns and enters the gigantic conservatory to her right. 
INT. CONSERVATORY 
Supergirl looks around and sees in the middle of the conservatory a reflecting pool surrounded by exotic plants. She walks closer and looks down into the reflecting pool. In the bottom of the shallow pool she sees Ethan securely bound. His eyes stare wildly. Dead or drowning. 
SUPERGIRL Ethan! 
She leaps into the shallow pool, and sinks over her head. A polygonal section of the surface of the reflecting pool detaches itself from the water and rises up perpendicularly. It is a door to the Phantom Zone. Supergirl is trapped behind an impenetrable force field, looking out in despair. Ethan is not there with her. His image has disappeared. 
The real flesh and blood Ethan appears with Selena from behind the strangler fig. They look in at Supergirl trapped behind the shimmering polygon that la ads to the Phantom Zone. Selena laughs at her, but Ethan stares as if at a long forgotten acquaintance whose name he is trying to recall. 
Selena notices Ethan's wandering attention and she puts her arms possessively around him. 
SELENA Enjoy your prison, Supergirl. It's forever. 
Supergirl calls out to Ethan, her hands and face pressed against the transparent wall of her prison, but no sound can escape the impenetrable force field. 
INT. PHANTOM ZONE DOOR 
Supergirl is seen in reverse, beating on the hard crystalline surface of the prison. 
SUPERGIRL Ethan! Don't let her do this! 
Beyond the threshold of the zone, Selena in her conservatory kisses Ethan with fierce lust. He returns her , emotion, forgetting all about Supergirl. 
SUPERGIRL No. No. It isn't true. 
The image of Selena and Ethan begins to recede, getting smaller and smaller, until it vanishes entirely in infinite blackness. 
EXT. SPACE 
The flat two-dimensional polygon that is Supergirl's prison whirls away through space. Behind the transparent surface we can see Supergirl's face stained with tears. 
EXT. PHANTOM ZONE 
Another kind of reality. Unlike anything we have ever seen. The crystal prison lands on the ground of the Phantom Zone and shatters. Supergirl picks herself up from among the fragments of her prison and looks around. The landscape is utterly strange and alien, with a feel of stark, oppressive sterility. As far as the eye can see there is no sign of life. Supergirl stands up and raises her arms to fly. She hops into the air about eight inches and lands flat-footedly on the sand. With a shock she realises SHE CAN'T FLY. 
She hops a few more times, with no more success. 
She picks up a small rock from the ground. She tries to crush it in her hand. She can't. Angrily she hurls it from her as far as she can. Instead of disappearing into infinity it drops at her feet a few yards away. She scoops up some sand from the ground and holds it cupped in her hand. She takes a deep breath and tries to blow it away. She is barely able to disturb a few grains. She drops the sand and sits down on a rock, forlorn and dejected. 
Suddenly she hears Alura's voice, very faint and coming from a long distance away. 
ALURA'S VOICE Kara, where are you? 
KARA Mother? I can hardly hear you. 
ALURA. S VOICE Kara! You're alive. We were so worried. You disappeared from the scanners... 
KARA I'm lost, Mother. In some awful place. I can't fly anymore. And I'm weak. 
ALURA'S VOICE Kara, you must not give up. We must retrieve the Power Source. The City is dying. 
KARA Then send someone else. I failed. 
ALURA'S VOICE We can't. The' dimension barrier is stronger. We no longer have the power to push through. 
KARA But Mother, I'm lost. 
ALURA' S VOICE You must try. . . it's cold. And dark. . . 
The rest of her sentence fades out, and is lost. 
KARA Mother---I tried. I really tried. 
Kara puts her face in her hands and starts to sob hopelessly. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. UNITED NATIONS, NEW YORK. DAY 
Establishing shot. 
INT. GENERAL ASSEMBLY 
The DELEGATE FROM URITANIA is going on (in Esperanto) denouncing the latest outrage against his peace-loving country. A few bored DELEGATES of various nationalities are sprawled in their seats listening to the simultaneous translation over earphones. The dign1fied PRESIDENT of the General Assembly is sitting on the dais behind the ranting delegate. With a FLASH OF LIGHT and a chok1ng cloud of sulfur fumes, Selena appears beside the podium. She is in her shimmering white robe. The dozing delegates wake up with amazement. The URITANIAN delegate stares at her with his mouth open as she slides him away from the microphone. 
ZALTAR A few hundred parasangs that way. I avoid them. And you should too. 
Zaltar leads Supergirl past the singing sculptures. She smiles as she passes them, and remembers his "tree" in Argo City. 
SUPERGIRL ...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..." 
ZALTAR What? Palace? Hardly. 
SUPERGIRL Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City... 
ZALTAR Yes. Can't seem to get away from that style. Must try something new. 
INT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE 
He helps her down a long spiraling staircase to the floor of a high domed room. In the centre of the room is a huge round table cluttered with tools, models and unfinished projects. 
SUPERGIRL It's lovely. . . 
ZALTAR No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness. 
SUPERGIRL Are you happy, Zaltar? 
ZALTAR What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time. 
SUPERGIRL But what about other people? Don't you miss them? 
They have reached the ground floor. Zaltar plucks one of the liquid filled bulbs from the stem of a large plant growing in a niche in the wall. He squirts some of the green liquid in his mouth with great satisfaction. 
ZALTAR I look at them all the time. Every planet in the galaxy. It's quite boring. Here, rub some of this onto that bruise. 
He carefully applies some of the green liquid to the wound on her scalp. 
SUPERGIRL You look at them? How? 
ZALTAR The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools. 
Zaltar sweeps the clutter off the table and onto the floor. 
He passes his hand over the table and instantly the table turns into a WINDOW INTO ANOTHER WORLD, showing an image of a herdboy riding on the back of a water buffalo in a rice paddy. 
ZALTAR There you see? What could be more boring than that? 
He waves his hand, and the image disappears. 
SUPERGIRL Wait. Could...could I see the place I just came from? 
Zaltar sighs with great martyrdom, and starts to fiddle with his controls. 
ZALTAR It'll only make you sad. 
He shows her the proper hand gestures to control the image. 
ZALTAR This goes closer. This moves it around. And this begins. 
He gestures with his hand and the WINDOW OPENS again. Supergirl ZOOMS THE IMAGE IN as fast as she can, trembling with desperate urgency. The IMAGE ON THE TABLE DISSOLVES FROM HIGH ABOVE A CITY DOWN TO : 
EXT. WALL STREET.  DAY 
The financial district. Bank clerks are shoveling money out the windows of several large, imposing banks. Passersby ignore the bonanza, and trudge dejectedly on. 
INT. STOCK EXCHANGE. DAY 
Chaos and pandemonium on the floor. Not the everyday chaos and pandemonium you always see. Brokers are trying to strangle one another. Fist fights. Bloody noses. The crunch of breaking knuckles. 
EXT. SUPERMARKET.  DAY 
People are waiting in line with wheelbarrows full of money. The store manager shakes his head and sends them away. The only people he lets in the store are a man with a live turkey under his arm, a little old lady carrying a Rembrandt in a nice gold frame, a woman who gives him her fur coat and a man with an antique clock. 
EXT. HIGH ABOVE SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN.  DAY 
The CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN and DISSOLVES THROUGH THE ROOF TO: 
INT. ANTE ROOM IN SELENA'S NEW HOUSE 
A mob of dignitaries and petitioners is waiting anxiously outside the large imposing doors to Selena's reception room. Generals in uniform, diplomats wearing their medals pinned ,on their formal suits, bankers in pin stripes, and the robed ecclesiastics and holy men of various faiths. A secretary opens the door to the reception room, and the dignitaries all surge forward. 
SECRETARY No more audiences today. Go home. All of you. 
JIMMY I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know. 
There is the clank of an iron door, and Ethan enters the prison with several of the guards in Selena's livery. He walks past the cells, glancing now and then with compassion at the poor wretches inside. Lucy calls out as he passes. 
LUCY Hey! Ethan! 
ETHAN Hmmm? 
LUCY Remember me? We were in a disaster together. 
ETHAN . Oh yeah, the girl in the hospital, on the other stretcher. 
LUCY Right! Say, do you swing any weight around here? 
ETHAN A little. 
LUCY Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place. 
ETHAN I'll mention it upstairs. 
He turns to go, but Jimmy reaches out and grabs his sleeve. 
JIMMY The blonde girl who saved your life---where is she now? 
Ethan pauses. Buried memories rise to the surface of his mind, bringing pain. 
ETHAN She's gone. No one will ever see her again. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE IN THE ZONE 
Supergirl waves her hand over the table angrily, decisively. The WINDOW of the Zone closes, and the image of Ethan disappears. She crosses to Zaltar, who is reclining on a couch in an adjoining room, getting drunk on the green liquid from the plant bladders. 
SUPERGIRL Zaltar, please help me. 
ZALTAR Of course, my dear. What can I do? 
SUPERGIRL Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me. 
Zaltar looks pained, and takes several deep drinks of green plant sap before he answers. 
ZALTAR There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here. 
SUPERGIRL If there's a way in, there must be a way out. 
ZALTAR No, that's not true---there's well...no-- 
He suddenly has an idea, vaguely forming at the back of his drink-sodden brain. He toys with it, while Supergirl leans forward eagerly, waiting. He changes his mind several times about whether it's possible or not, each time changing his facial expression. Supergirl has the feeling she's watching a debate conducted by squints and grimaces. 
ZALTAR There is a way. 
SUPERGIRL I knew it! 
ZALTAR But it's impossible. 
SUPERGIRL Why? 
ZALTAR No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it. 
Supergirl's heart sinks. She rocks back, clutching her knees, trying not to show her sadness. 
ZALTAR I could do it. 
She is suddenly all excitement and hopefulness again. 
SUPERGIRL Then teach me how. 
ZALTAR No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think. 
He takes another sip of his drink. 
SUPERGIRL Tell me how. to do it. If you could do it, I can. 
He looks at her shrewdly, appraising her abilities with a suddenly lucid glance. 
ZALTAR Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.

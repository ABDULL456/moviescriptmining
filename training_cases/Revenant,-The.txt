FADE IN: 
EXT. UPPER MISSOURI RIVER/1820'S - EVENING 
ANGLE ON A SINGLE COTTONWOOD LEAF... brown and crisp... clinging to its empty branch... the solitary sign of life on an otherwise barren tree. 
A gust of wind... the leaf breaks free... flutters down, landing in the slow current of the Missouri. The last leaf of the fall, taking its final journey south. 
As it floats along the surface, rising and falling with the current, all we can hear is the river's gentle movement... the trickle of water... the splash of timid rapids... until DISTANT VOICES invade this world... soft at first, but growing louder... LAUGHTER... SINGING. 
And then our leaf CRASHES INTO A WOODEN BOARD... the BOW OF A BOAT. We hear the VOICES EVEN CLEARER... MEN'S VOICES, as we rise up the bow... see it's a FLATBOAT BEACHED ON A SANDBAR at the center of the river. 
Beyond the flatboat are the voices... TWENTY MEN of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, making camp along the shore... hauling wood, building campfires, pitching squares of canvas for makeshift rooftops. And this camp is full of life because these are some of the first men to ever see this untouched wilderness... men with a whole new world just waiting for them to claim their share. 
EXT. CAMP - EVENING 
CAPTAIN ANDREW HENRY, (late 20's), dressed in a buckskin jacket with long fringe... thick belt pulled tightly around his waist with two pistols and a knife hanging from it. He stands out among the others... like an imposter pretending to be a member of some exclusive club. He pulls off one of his gloves... examines the BLOOD-FILLED BLISTERS lining his palm. 
From across the camp, JOHN FITZGERALD, (40's), solid and thick... dark eyes of a killer, watches Henry. He nudges MACE BOONE, (40's), a thief in a previous life. 
FITZGERALD Likely got a splinter. Can't figure what to do without Mama here to pull it out for him. 
Boone chuckles... spits in Henry's direction. 
BOONE Need a doc, Captain? 
Henry looks up... sees Fitzgerald and Boone grinning at him. He slides his glove back on. 
HENRY Gather more wood. 
Fitzgerald waits for Henry to turn, then gives his back an exaggerated salute. 
FITZGERALD (under his breath) Shame my Pap was a broken down drunk. Else he could've bought me a Captain's job too. 
Boone snickers. Fitzgerald stomps his boot onto a branch, easily snaps it into two easy-to-carry pieces. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) We got a plan for these fires, Captain, or are we roastin' berries all the way up to Fort Union? 
HENRY Glass and the others will be back with some game, Fitzgerald. Just make sure you have the fires ready. 
FITZGERALD My supper's in the hands of a hermit nigger, a kid and a dummy. Hell, my belly feels full already. 
Fitzgerald's boot CRACKS another branch... and when it does, we hear the EXPLOSION OF A GUNSHOT. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WILDERNESS - EVENING 
And a CLOUD OF SMOKE surrounding the LONG BARREL OF AN ANSTADT RIFLE. 
The smoke fades, and at the other end of the rifle we see the face of HUGH GLASS, (40's), African-American, one eye still closed, as the other calmly stares down that barrel. 
VOICE (O.S.) Shit fire, you got him, Mr. Glass! 
Glass lowers the rifle, as PIG GILMORE, (30's), fat and filthy, races past. 
Henry shoves a TRAPPER toward the water. An arrow drives into the trapper's leg... he goes down. Henry lifts the man to pull him into the river, but several more arrows bury in the man's back... he falls limp. Henry FIRES HIS PISTOLS, dropping the WARRIOR. 
Bridger and Pig join Glass... splash into the river, SHOOTING back at the attacking Arikara. The water deepens, and they start swimming toward the flatboat. 
ARROWS HISS into the water all around them. 
Glass is still in the shallows... aims his pistol... BAM... shoots an oncoming warrior... spins after the other men... joins them as they near the flatboat. 
A final TRAPPER charges down the shore behind them. SEVERAL WARRIORS pursue him. 
TRAPPER WAIT! 
He aims his pistol over his shoulder as he runs... pulls the trigger... CLICK... pulls it again... CLICK. But he's too scared to stop his finger... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... THUD... as a hatchet buries in his back. He crashes face first into the shallows. 
The Arikara leader, (ELK'S TONGUE), animal bones braided into his mohawk, a NECKLACE OF HUMAN EARS around his neck, straddles the dying man. Elk's Tongue grabs the Trapper by the hair, and CUTS OFF HIS LEFT EAR, then holds it up to Glass and the others, as he SCREAMS HIS WAR CRY. 
Glass and the men shove the flatboat off the sandbar... start scrambling aboard, as arrows dart past them... drive into the wooden boat. 
Suddenly a WARRIOR EXPLODES FROM THE WATER... tackles Bridger as he climbs up the side of the flatboat... jerks him back into the river. Bridger flails in the water... watches the warrior raise his hatchet high to slam down... just as Glass SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS ANSTADT into the back of the Warrior's head. 
The Warrior collapses under the surface. Glass grabs Bridger's hand... drags him up onto the deck. 
BRIDGER Thank you. 
But Glass is already gone... FIRING BACK AT THE ARIKARA, as the current carries them away. 
VOICE (O.S.) HEY! 
Pig looks over the side... sees a frantic WILLIAM ANDERSON gripped to the edge. Pig pulls him onto the boat. 
Fitzgerald and Glass grab LONGPOLES... shove them against the river's bottom to pick up speed. 
Henry stands on deck, watching as Elk's Tongue yanks a DYING TRAPPER's head back by his hair to peel away his scalp. 
Henry drops his eyes... can't watch. The TRAPPER'S SCREAM ECHOES OVER HIM. 
EXT. MISSOURI RIVER/FLATBOAT - LATER 
Quiet and dark... the battle long over. The flatboat floats with the gentle current. The NINE SURVIVING TRAPPERS are scattered around the deck... Glass digging an arrow out of WALLACE MURPHY'S SHOULDER... Fitzgerald poling on one side with Anderson on the other... STUBBY BILL VANCE and Pig standing patrol with their rifles... Bridger doctoring a badly WOUNDED TRAPPER... and Henry standing at the front of the flatboat, staring off blankly. 
FITZGERALD What's the plan, Captain? 
Henry's still lost in those screams. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Captain! What the hell do we do now? 
Henry snaps out of his stare... turns to the men... obviously doesn't have an answer. 
ANDERSON We're just floatin' farther from Fort Union. 
Henry's eyes instinctively look to Glass. 
GLASS The Missouri's no good. Not if the `Ree's running it. 
FITZGERALD So we just float the hell down to Mexico or wherever else this river takes us? 
GLASS We get ourselves safe outta range, then track another course up. 
FITZGERALD Add weeks to the trip. 
BRIDGER Better that than endin' up scalped on the side of the river. 
FITZGERALD (shoving him away) Shut up, kid, you don't get no say in this. 
Bridger starts to respond, but Fitzgerald's angry glare stops him. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) (back to Henry) And in case you hadn't noticed, Captain, we're twelve men short of what we were. (off the badly wounded TRAPPER) Thirteen before long. 
HENRY I understand our situation, Mr. Fitzgerald. We do like Glass said... put some distance between us and the Arikara, then chart a course to Fort Union. 
Fitzgerald MUMBLES UNDER HIS BREATH... rolls those dark eyes to Anderson. Glass gives Henry a nod. 
EXT. MISSOURI RIVER/FLATBOAT - NIGHT 
The others exchange nervous glances... uh-oh. 
Fitzgerald walks to Glass... snaps his fingers for Glass' Anstadt. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Lemme see what's so special `bout that shooter of yours. 
Nothing from Glass, so Fitzgerald grabs the barrel, but Glass holds firm. 
GLASS Middle of workin' on it. 
FITZGERALD Well you can stop workin' on it, and let me have a look like I said. 
Fitzgerald gives another tug, but Glass' grip only grows tighter. His eyes roll up to Fitzgerald... make it clear he isn't giving up his rifle. And they hold that stare just as hard as they're holding Glass' rifle. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) You forget your place? 
GLASS Best I can tell, my place is right where I want it... on the smart end of my rifle. 
Fitzgerald realizes the barrel he's holding is aimed right at his stomach, while Glass' hand seems suddenly very close to the trigger. But Fitzgerald's pride and that whiskey won't let him lose this tug of war. 
FITZGERALD I'd be careful if I was you, boy. 
And this thing's about to turn real ugly... until... 
HENRY That's enough, Fitzgerald. Go sober up and get to sleep. (MORE) HENRY(CONT'D) If you're passed out when we break camp tomorrow, I leave you here. 
Fitzgerald holds his glare on Glass, then releases the rifle, shoving it back at Glass. He glances to Henry, and throws back a big gulp from the bottle just for spite, before backing away from Glass. 
FITZGERALD That's the trouble with this part of the world. No mirrors. Niggers forget what color they are. 
Glass ignores Fitzgerald... goes back to his rifle. Fitzgerald tosses the bottle at Anderson, then jerks his blanket up... walks off to sleep by himself. 
Glass glances up from his work... just long enough to give Bridger a nod. 
EXT. CAMP - LATER 
Fitzgerald sleeping off that whiskey. The others snoring in a cluster at the center of the camp. Henry lies there awake... looks across to Glass, still sitting against the tree, a HANDRAWN MAP in his lap, as his eyes pierce the darkness. Henry eases over to Glass. 
HENRY Can't sleep either? 
GLASS Never like closin' my eyes when I'm not sure who'll be standin' over me when I open `em. 
HENRY I keep thinking about Boone and the others... how maybe I should've had us make camp further up river. 
GLASS The tracks I saw... those `Ree had been tailin' us for a while. They'd have gone as far north as it took. (BEAT) You're a good man, Captain. Soon as you realize that, these others will too. 
Henry likes hearing that... still isn't sure it's true. 
HENRY Your years trappin' and guidin' out here... have you had much experience with the Arikara? 
GLASS Enough to try and stay outta their way. 
HENRY (motions to Glass' map) But you know this country well enough to get us past them... up to Fort Union? 
GLASS I been here a long while. Whether that gets us to Union or not... 
Henry waits for more... doesn't get it. So he just nods and starts back to his blanket.... stops. 
HENRY What Fitzgerald said earlier... he doesn't speak for the rest. 
GLASS He wasn't wrong. Truth is that's what I prefer about this country... it's got no eye for the color of a man's skin. 
HENRY (BEAT) Try to get some sleep, Hugh. 
Henry climbs back under his blanket. Glass just sits there looking at the map. 
ANGLE ON GLASS' MAP... 
...primitive at best. Sketched mountains... winding blue lines for rivers... small dots are scattered about with names beside them... "Brazeau", "Talbot", "Union". And DOZENS OF TRIANGLE PINE TREES have been drawn, representing the endless wilderness. 
We TIGHTEN ON THOSE TRIANGLES until we're lost in them. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
HENRY Lay that rag over his eyes, Mr. Bridger. 
BRIDGER But, Captain. 
HENRY Do it. 
Bridger hesitates, then reaches to fold the wet rag down over Glass' wide open eyes. And Glass must know what's happening, because his eyes roll up to Bridger's... his lips try to form a word... his hand digs its fingers into the dirt beside him. 
CUT TO: 
GLASS' POV - ON BRIDGER... 
...the boy looking away as he pulls the rag over our eyes... everything goes black. 
HENRY (O.S.) Step clear, Mr. Bridger. 
A LONG BEAT in the dark, waiting for that gunshot, then... 
BACK TO SCENE 
Henry standing over Glass... pistol aimed down. His hand trembles slightly. 
Pig turns away... presses his hands over his ears. 
Bridger takes a few steps back... stares at Henry. 
Henry struggles to steady his aim, until finally it calms... because he's thought of something else. 
HENRY (CONT'D) There's a seventy dollar bonus from the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to the two men that stay with Glass... see this through. Then give him a proper burial. 
BRIDGER I'll stay with him... money or not. 
PIG Same here. 
HENRY I can't let you stay back, Pig. Without Glass, I'll need you to scout. 
Henry looks to the others... they all drop their eyes... not interested. 
HENRY (CONT'D) Just need one more. 
FITZGERALD Two won't stand much chance against a party of `Ree, Captain, and seventy dollars won't buy me a new setta ears. 
HENRY A hundred then. 
Still nothing from the others. 
BRIDGER They can have my share too. I owe Glass that at least. 
FITZGERALD That case I'll hang back with the kid. I don't mind fallin' a day or so behind for two hundred. 
HENRY But Glass is to be cared for until. Understood? 
FITZGERALD (motions to Bridger) I'll let the young doctor do his job. 
Henry hesitates... doesn't like this, but knows it's the best option left. 
HENRY The rest gather your gear. 
Bridger reaches down... lifts the rag from Glass' face. Their eyes meet... Bridger gives Glass a nod. 
EXT. CAMP - LATER 
Henry and the others are loaded and ready to leave. Pig bends down over Glass. 
PIG I'll see ya at Fort Union, Hugh. 
Glass's glazed eyes focus on Pig. He moves the only thing he can... BLINKS a "yes" back at him. 
HENRY (to Fitzgerald and BRIDGER) As long as necessary. 
BRIDGER I'll look after him. 
Henry turns... leads the men into the trees... toward the Grand... toward Fort Union. 
A few of them land, but it's only a moment before Fitzgerald is back in control... HEAD-BUTTING Bridger off of him... tossing him away, then KICKING BRIDGER IN THE STOMACH... AGAIN. He grabs his knife... is ready to finish Bridger off... 
...but Fitzgerald is smart enough to know that out here, two are safer than one... even when one is just a kid. He starts walking away. 
BRIDGER I'm goin' back for him. 
FITZGERALD Far as we ran all night, you couldn't find Glass with dogs and a map. And I don't believe you really want to. `Cause after leavin' him to die the first time, I doubt he'd be too happy to see you now. 
Fitzgerald digs at the dirt with the knife... covers the fire's remains. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) And just so we're clear. If you try to backtrack without me knowin', or ever get so guilty you feel the need to tell somebody. 
Fitzgerald looks at Bridger... hard... evil. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I'll have no choice but to gut you from nuts to nose. 
Fitzgerald stares his point home, then shoves the blade into his belt, and stands. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) Now let's go. 
Bridger wipes the blood from his face, then throws one last glance behind him before following Fitzgerald. 
EXT. CAMP - MORNING 
Empty and quiet... no sign of life... until GLASS' HAND RISES BETWEEN THE BRANCHES. His fingers dig into the earth, pulling himself up from the hole... a dead man climbing out of his own grave. 
He rolls out to the ground... arches in pain when his back hits the cold, hard surface. Glass lies there shivering, regaining what little strength he has, then rolls over... starts dragging himself again with that one good arm. He makes it to the blanket... wraps it around him. 
Glass rests there in the center of camp... unable to move... his eyes scanning the surroundings... no food... no water... and he's wide open in this clearing... an easy target for any predator. So he grabs his Possibles bag and GUNPOWDER HORN, and drags himself toward the cover of brush. 
And every movement takes all the will Glass has... a push with his good leg followed by a pull with his healthy arm... inch by inch... foot by foot... sweat pouring down his face as he finally reaches the cover of the trees... continues on... dragging himself across the forest floor in a desperate, hopeless crawl for survival. 
But finally it's too much for Glass... the fever and pain overwhelm him. He collapses... falls unconscious. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY 
Glass lies in the dirt, weak... dehydrated... starving. He looks at his hands... scratched and bloody from clawing his weight. 
He unwraps his small, leather Possibles bag... dumps it to the ground, revealing it contents... flints, a straight razor, his map, and a LEATHER NECKLACE WITH THE SIX-INCH BEAR CLAW attached. Glass grabs the razor... cuts SEVERAL THIN STRIPS FROM THE BLANKET, and wraps them around his hands. 
He shoves the rest back in the bag, and does the only thing he can do... start crawling again... push with his healthy leg... pull with his good arm. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - LATER 
Glass dragging himself up a steep slope... over rocks... the jagged edges catching the wounds... tearing the primitive stitching. The gashes rip wider... blood oozes down, leaving a crimson trail dripping down the rock behind him. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT 
The wind is howling through the trees. Glass lies beneath a cluster of brush... shivering... bleeding. Every aching breath creates a puff of smoke in the cold, night air. 
EXT. MARSH - DAY 
Thick with a sea of four-foot high Cattails... like miniature cornstalks. Looking down from above the marsh we see a two- foot wide path of crushed plants that reaches the center of the marsh, and stops. 
We tighten on the end of the path, until we see Glass lying among the Cattails. He's sawing off one of the stalks with the straight razor... peeling away the husk, and eating the tender flesh beneath. 
Mosquitoes move in clouds around him... over his face... arms. But Glass' injured body only allows him one action at a time, so the mosquitoes have their fill of him, as he gnaws on the Cattail. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY 
Glass pulling himself along the ground... stopping to tear a FEW BERRIES from a plant, and shove them in his mouth. He flinches as he swallows. He starts to move again, but freezes... listens... RUSHING WATER. 
Glass digs his fingers into the ground with new energy... pulls himself toward the sound... up over a ridge... and there it is at the bottom of the ridge... 
...THE GRAND RIVER... WATER. Glass crawls down toward it. 
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY 
Glass drags himself to the river's edge, cupping handfuls of water and rubbing it over his parched lips... withstanding the pain to gulp it down. 
As he does, Glass notices a FISH hovering in the shallows beside him. He makes a desperate grab for the fish, but it darts easily away. 
Glass cups more water to his mouth, but with each drink, he feels the water leak from a hole in his throat... run down his neck. He leans out over the surface to check his reflection... barely recognizes the swollen, stitched- together, disfigured face staring back at him. He fights off the urge to vomit... pulls the razor from the leather bag, and cuts more strips of blanket, soaking them in the river, then cleaning his wounds. 
EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT 
Dark... the moon hidden behind clouds. A heavy mist hangs over the river. Glass is draped across the log, eyes closed... letting the slow current carry him south. But then his eyes open... because he hears something... a LOW RUMBLE. 
Glass looks to the river banks... too foggy to see anything clearly. The RUMBLE GROWS LOUDER. He peers ahead... too dark to see much... just ANOTHER SPLINTERED LOG floating in front of him, its one jagged branch rising up in the air. 
But then THE LOG VANISHES. Glass squints through the fog, scanning the surface. But it's gone... the water's empty... that LOW RUMBLE GROWS EVEN LOUDER. 
Glass looks to the water beside him... a BRANCH GLIDES PAST AT A HIGHER SPEED. And now Glass knows what's coming, but it's too late... because the world suddenly turns upside down, as Glass tumbles over the edge of a TWENTY FOOT WATERFALL. 
He spirals downward... crashes into the rushing current. He's washed forward with the suddenly violent rapids. They pull him under the surface, then toss him GASPING back out. 
The river carries him blindly through the mist... tossing... turning... SLAMMING HIM INTO A HUGE BOULDER... CRACK... he spins off, swept away headfirst... the foaming water sucking him down the rocky gauntlet. 
He tumbles over more boulders... his Possibles bag snaps loose... Glass makes a grab for it, but is suddenly flipped down another set of falls. 
The Possibles Bag is lost in the raging river. 
Glass sinks beneath the surface, then floats back up, as the rapids calm... spit Glass to the gentle shallows. His body drifts face-down toward shore. 
And just when we're sure Glass has to finally be dead, his arm reaches up from the water... he digs his fingers into the muddy bank, and drags himself out of the river. 
Glass collapses unconscious to the ground, his body shrouded in that mist. 
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY 
TIGHT ON THE LEFT SIDE OF GLASS' FACE... the right still pressed into the muddy bank. The sun beats down... then SHADOWS APPEAR... BOUNCE ACROSS HIM... something is standing over Glass. 
And then a VULTURE'S HEAD DROPS INTO FRAME... 
...latches its beak onto Glass' cheek... tugs at it... stretches it. Glass' eyes pop open... we PULL BACK to see THREE VULTURES surrounding Glass' body, pecking and clawing at his battered wounds. 
Glass swings his good arm, knocking one of the vultures away. He tries to cry out, but only that PRIMITIVE HISS ERUPTS from his throat. 
The vultures dance away from his flailing... aren't willing to give up their meal so easily... dart in for quick attacks on his flesh. 
Glass grasps a branch... swings at the birds, beating them back. The vultures give up the battle... fly away. 
Glass crumbles back to the ground... squints up into the sun... the SILHOUETTES OF THE VULTURES CIRCLING ABOVE HIM... waiting for him to die. 
Glass looks down to his wounds, again oozing blood. He glances around... sees a ridge just a few hundred yards away. 
At the base of the ridge, a GIANT BOULDER has broken free, creating a partial cave. Glass starts crawling toward it. And if it's possible, he looks even closer to death now than when he started this journey. 
EXT. CAVE - DAY 
No more than ten feet deep, but enough to hide from predators. Glass drags himself as far back in the recess as he can... collapses against the rock wall. 
INT. CAVE - DAY 
Glass gathers loose sticks and grass into a small pile... begins sparking rocks together to build a fire. 
INT. CAVE - LATER 
The fire burns beside Glass, as he TEARS A SINGLE THREAD of cloth from the tattered blanket, then feeds it through a tiny hole in a JAGGED, NEEDLE-SIZED SLIVER OF SHARPENED ROCK... a man-made needle and thread. 
Glass goes to work on the open wounds of his chest... piercing his skin with the rock... wincing with pain as he tugs the thread through the fresh hole in his skin... pierces the other side of the wound, then pulls the flesh tightly together... before repeating the excruciating process all over again... pierce... pull... pierce... tighten. 
EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT 
The moon's glow reflects off the water. 
INT. CAVE - NIGHT 
ANGLE ON GLASS' HAND... 
...holding a small sharp stone, and SCRATCHING LETTERS INTO THE CAVE'S ROCK WALL. 
WE PAN DOWN TO THE GROUND... still listening to the SCRATCHING OF THE ROCK as we glide across the dirt... reach the fire... its flame warm and strong. We TIGHTEN ON THE FIRE, until WE'RE INSIDE IT... and then WE PULL BACK... 
...and we see the fire has long died away... just black ash. The O.S. SCRATCHING has silenced. We glide back across the cave floor... to Glass unconscious on the ground. And above him on the wall, we see what he had been scratching... 
"Robbed and left to die by Fitzgerald and Bridger. If find eether kill for Hugh Glass" 
The Arikara... unknowingly standing just above Glass... looking back to the tracks... scanning the water. But the surface is empty, and the river's too thick with mud to see anything below. 
But they keep looking... and we're waiting for Glass to explode from the river, gasping for air. But he doesn't... and they keep scanning for what seems an eternity, until finally, the warriors turn... start walking back up the path. 
Behind them, Glass' face inches to the surface... pulls in some oxygen... watches as they fade into the trees. 
Then Glass rolls the rock away... starts moving deeper into the river... fighting the current to grab rocks and boulders... pulling himself to the other side. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY 
Glass limps through the trees, still dripping with the muddy water of the Grand. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - LATER 
Glass is on his knees, desperately grabbing for a TINY FIELD MOUSE. The rodent escapes into a hole. Glass claws at the ground after it. He's starving to death. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT 
The rain beating down through the trees. Glass huddles in a cluster of bushes, trying to stay dry... shivering in the cold. He reaches out from the cover, grabbing his moccasin boot standing in the rain. He pulls it in... slurps back the rainfall that it's caught. 
EXT. PRAIRIE - EVENING 
Glass limps slowly across the rolling prairie. He's weak... starving... isn't going to make it much further. He drops to his hands and knees. 
And then he feels something... the ground almost trembling under his hands. He watches his hands quiver with vibration. A RUMBLE BUILDS. Glass strains to hear... looks to the crest of a hill... labors up the gentle slope toward the sound. 
EXT. PRAIRIE/HILL - EVENING 
Glass reaches the crest... looks over the other side to a HERD OF BUFFALO THUNDERING ACROSS THE PRAIRIE. 
An incredible site... hundreds of massive creatures... their hooves tearing up the earth, leaving a cloud of dust behind them. 
Behind the herd, a PACK OF WOLVES FIGHT OVER A FALLEN BUFFALO. 
Glass lies in the high grass, watching the wolves SNARL AND SNAP over the remains. And he eyes that buffalo... the closest he's been to food in days. 
EXT. PLAINS - NIGHT 
The five wolves rest around the downed buffalo, their snouts bloody from the meal. Suddenly, one of the wolves' heads snaps up... bares its teeth... SNARLS. 
And then we see what the wolf is growling at... Glass... limping out of the shadows toward the animals, holding a BURNING SAGE BUSH IN EACH HAND... like giant FLAMING HANDS clawing in the night. 
The wolves jump to their feet, unsure of what's approaching. They growl at Glass. But Glass keeps coming... doing his best to YELL... more like GROWL back at the wolves. He swings the flaming brush, tossing glowing sparks through the air. 
The wolves spread out, instinctively surrounding Glass. But Glass singles out each one... charges, waving the flames... driving each wolf back. 
Four of the wolves back away, but the leader holds its ground... even moves toward Glass... only a few feet away... SNARLING... bloody jaws ready to attack, but still not sure what its up against. 
Glass shakes the flames at the wolf... it SNAPS AT GLASS' ARM. Glass swings the other... slams the fiery plant across the wolf's head. 
The wolf YELPS... leaps back... starts to run away, but turns back... makes another charge at Glass. But Glass is ready... throws the flaming ball of sage at the wolf, then clubs it with the other. The animal's fur begins to burn. 
The frightened wolf has had enough... rolls on the ground, then spins to join the rest of its pack. They run a safe distance, then stop... keeping a watch on Glass. 
Glass drags the burning sage bushes along the ground, igniting the grass and brush... creating a foot-high flaming wall between him and the wolves. 
He stretches the flame into a circle, a fiery ring surrounds the fallen buffalo. 
The wolves have seen enough... turn... race away from the flames. 
As the grass around him burns, Glass drops the sage plants... attacks the buffalo remains, tearing away bloody chunks of flesh from the carcass, and shoving them into his mouth... a starving animal that's finally found food. 
EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT 
From high above the prairie... Glass and the buffalo at the center of that glowing ring of fire. 
EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY 
The wind's gusting... bending the high golden grass over on its side. Glass moves slowly across, pulling his collar up to shield his face from the cold winds. He spots something in the distant sky ahead... a THIN LINE OF BLACK SMOKE. Glass picks up his pace... hope spurring him on. 
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY 
The charred, skeletal remains of a tribe's village... just black posts where tee-pees once stood... a half-burned log lodge still smokes, sending that black line into the sky. 
Three Feathers runs his hand across Glass' back, dragging a HANDFUL OF WORMS for Glass to see. As Glass' eyes widen in panic, Spotted Horse SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS KNIFE against Glass' head. 
Glass drops to his knees... makes a dazed grab for Spotted Horse... misses... and Spotted Horse HITS GLASS AGAIN. Glass tumbles unconscious to the dirt. 
Spotted Horse says something to the others... they grab Glass' limp arms... drag him toward the horses. 
EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - NIGHT 
Dozens of glowing campfires dot the prairie, along with a sea of tee-pees, their willow poles fanning against the night sky. Animal hides and painted designs decorate the various tee-pees and lodges. SIOUX CHILDREN laugh and play about the village... freeze when they hear Spotted Horse and the other riders splash across the stream. 
The warriors ride into the village, Glass' body tossed over the back of Three Feather's horse. The children race to them. 
ANGLE ON GLASS... regaining consciousness... eyes blinking... trying to focus. 
CUT TO: 
GLASS' POV - FROM THE BACK OF THE HORSE... 
...to the children's eager faces swarming around him... studying this strange face. 
Spotted Horse - YELLING SOMETHING at the children... they back away from Glass... fall into line behind the riders. 
Sioux MEN and WOMEN watch as the procession moves past... to a tee-pee set away from the rest... its hide walls decorated with wild lightning bolts and buffalo and vaguely human figures circling the sun. 
An OLD MEDICINE MAN, gnarled and leathery, a DEAD RAVEN tied in his long hair, his naked chest painted with red and black stripes, steps out of the tee-pee. He eyes Glass, as Three Feathers and Running Fox carry him inside. 
Suddenly, the Medicine Man begins CHANTING. 
CUT TO: 
A FLURRY OF IMAGES ACCOMPANIED BY THE MEDICINE MAN'S V.O. CHANTING... 
LEATHER STRAPS SNAPPING AROUND GLASS' WRISTS AND ANKLES... stretched tight. 
Glass, naked, on his stomach at the center of the tee-pee, his arms and legs outstretched, secured to wooden stakes in the ground. The white worms cover his back. 
The Medicine Man... CHANTING... waving burning sticks in the air. 
A THICK LIQUID BOILING IN A POT... the Medicine Man's twisted hand reaching a gourd container in... filling it with the steaming mixture. 
The liquid POURING OVER GLASS' BACK. 
GLASS' FACE... arched to the sky... twisted in horrible pain. He SCREAMS THAT HORRIBLE GROWLING CRY. 
MORE IMAGES... even faster... the CHANTING more frantic... 
A SIOUX WOMAN,(WAKI), staring down. 
HANDS wiping a GREEN SLUDGE over Glass' neck... chest. 
The Medicine Man dancing... chanting... shaking sticks lined with RATTLESNAKE TAILS. 
The moonlight shining through the tee-pee, illuminating the images of the buffalo and dancing shapes. 
Waki gently pouring fluid into Glass' mouth. 
The Medicine Man holding the SEVERED HEAD OF A SNAKE... lightly sinking the fangs around the wounds on Glass' throat. 
GLASS' EYES... wide open... rolling up white into his head. 
AND THE CHANTING STOPS... the world goes dark. 
EXT. YELLOWSTONE RIVER - DAY 
Cutting through the open prairie. Snow-covered peaks touch the sky in the distance. 
Fitzgerald and Bridger trudge their way across the prairie, dressed in furs. They rise up a steep slope... reach the top, and spot the cluster of log buildings inside a massive thirty-foot tall wooden fence. Fort Union. 
Bridger smiles... relieved. 
FITZGERALD `Bout goddamn time. 
They start down the slope. Fitzgerald grabs Bridger's arm... firmly. 
Bridger's head snaps to Fitzgerald... don't make this worse. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) So that's what we did. 
Pig reaches up... gives Bridger a pat on the back. But to Bridger, it feels like a red-hot blade. 
HENRY Glad to hear you pulled your weight, Mr. Bridger. I knew you would. 
FITZGERALD More than his share, Captain. 
And now Fitzgerald has snared Bridger into his lie. Bridger drops his eyes to his feet. 
HENRY Speaking of shares. 
Henry turns to a SAFE resting against the wall. Fitzgerald watches as Henry spins the dial... locks in the combination, then pulls the latch. The safe door swings open... 
...revealing STACKS OF CASH. 
Fitzgerald's eyes lock on all that money. Henry pulls out a handful... starts counting them out onto the desk. 
HENRY (CONT'D) Am I to assume the agreed arrangement didn't change? 
FITZGERALD Fortunate for me, it did not. 
HENRY Well thank you both for your courage and honor. You have done yourselves proud. 
Fitzgerald swipes up his pile of bills. Henry drops a couple bills in front of Bridger. 
HENRY (CONT'D) You're owed something for what you did. 
Bridger stares down at the bills a beat, then snatches them... pushes his way out of the office before he might have to look someone in the eye. 
FITZGERALD He's beat hisself up most of the trip... wishin' he'da done more. 
HENRY We all saw the shape Glass was in. There was no more to be done. 
FITZGERALD That's what I been tellin' him. 
INT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY 
Empty, except for Bridger curled up on his cot, squeezing those crumpled bills in his hand, crying. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. TEE-PEE - DAY 
Glass sleeps under a buffalo robe. His eyes flicker open. 
CUT TO: 
GLASS' POV - ON THE BUFFALO AND DANCING FIGURE DESIGNS SHADOWED THROUGH THE TEE-PEE. 
GLASS - His hand reaching up to his throat. It looks much better than we last saw. And the stitches are gone from his face, now just long, pink scars. He stiffly raises himself up... remembers his back... struggles to reach behind him... scarred but clean... no maggots. 
He looks beside him... sees BUCKSKIN PANTS AND SHIRT resting on the ground... waiting for him. 
EXT. TEE-PEE - DAY 
ANGLE ON GLASS... dressed... pushing his way out through the flap of the tee-pee... limping out into the midday sun, and shielding his eyes. He looks like a man that hasn't seen the light of day for weeks. 
Glass adjusts to the brightness... stares in wonder at the scene. 
And then we see what Glass is looking at, and understand his reaction... the entire village is blanketed in snow. The Sioux VILLAGERS move about, wearing heavy skins and furs. 
A WOMEN'S O.S. VOICE turns Glass... 
...to WAKI, the woman from the images, walking toward him, bundled in fur. She says something else we can't understand... points to Glass' feet. Glass looks down... to his BARE FEET BURIED DEEP IN THE SNOW. He hadn't noticed. 
And then Waki smiles... a sweet, pretty smile. She takes his hand... leads him back into the tee-pee. 
INT. TEE-PEE - CONTINUOUS 
Glass and Waki enter. She pulls a pair of moccasins from a basket... hands them to Glass. 
Spotted Horse (cont'd) We trade Bra-zo. 
Glass stares at the tanning hides, then down at his leg. Finally, he nods. Spotted Horse starts walking... waves for Glass to follow. 
Spotted Horse (cont'd) Come. Eat. 
Glass follows after him. The children sneak in behind, giggling as they tail Glass across camp. 
Glass glances back... New Moon and Little One duck behind a tee-pee... wait for him to continue before they scoot back out after him. 
INT. CHIEF'S LODGE - NIGHT 
Glass, Spotted Horse, Three Feathers, Running Fox and OTHER WARRIORS sit around a fire, eating with CHIEF RED HAWK, the Medicine Man, and several other TRIBAL ELDERS. 
GLASS The men stole my rifle. 
The Sioux don't understand. Glass reaches over, taking Spotted Horse's plate. 
GLASS (CONT'D) They took. They took... 
Glass aims an imaginary rifle. 
GLASS (CONT'D) ...my rifle. My gear. 
Now Spotted Horse understands... translates for the others. 
GLASS (CONT'D) They left me to die. So I mean to find `em both. Get my rifle back. 
Spotted Horse translates again. Red Hawk nods, studying Glass. 
Red Hawk SAYS SOMETHING to Glass... motions to the BEAR CLAW NECKLACE. Glass looks to Spotted Horse. 
SPOTTED HORSE Red Hawk ask who kill griz-lee. 
Glass touches his chest. Red Hawk nods, impressed. Glass points to the JAGGED SCARS running up Red Hawk's neck to a MISSING RIGHT EAR. 
GLASS Grizzly? 
Red Hawk smiles... shakes his head. 
RED HAWK Arikara. 
That word, Glass understands. Red Hawk rambles a long sentence in Sioux. The other members LAUGH. 
SPOTTED HORSE He say Arikara take right ear of Sioux. Left ear of whites. Not know what they take from you. 
Glass smiles along with the others. They continue their meal. 
EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - DAY 
Snow falls over Glass, as he stands outside the tee-pee, flexing his injured leg... putting more weight on it... testing its recovered strength. 
Suddenly, a SPEAR PLANTS INTO THE GROUND BETWEEN HIS FEET. Glass turns, startled... sees Spotted Horse, Three Feathers, Running Fox, and several OTHER WARRIORS staring at him. 
Glass' eyes jump from the spear to the warriors, unsure. 
Spotted Horse strides to Glass... grabs the spear, then spins it sideways... stares at Glass, until a smile spreads across Spotted Horse's face... he holds the spear out to Glass. 
SPOTTED HORSE Buff-A-lo Man hunt with Sioux? 
Glass relaxes... nods... takes the spear from Spotted Horse. Three Feathers hands a BUFFALO HIDE to Glass... motions for Glass to put it on. 
THREE FEATHERS Tatanka Wicasa. 
Glass wraps the hide around him. The Warriors smile and nod. 
EXT. FOREST - DAY 
A world of silent white... like we're inside a giant snow- globe. The sky is emptying all the snow it has over us... pouring down... the only sound comes from the flakes hitting the already fallen snow. The pale trunks of Cottonwoods rise up from the white ground. 
Then out of the white... a SHAPE APPEARS... a GIANT WOLF WALKING ON ITS HIND LEGS. But as the wolf comes closer, we see it's not a wolf at all... it's THREE FEATHERS, wearing his WOLF SKIN. He CRIES OUT... HOWLING WILDLY. 
A few yards beside him, another WARRIOR is doing the same... CHANTING... beating his spear against the Cottonwoods as he walks. 
Spotted Horse (O.S.) Bra-zo. 
Glass turns to Spotted Horse, pointing to the hides. Glass nods... looks back to the last of the hides being pulled down... doesn't seem as excited as he once might have been. 
EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - LATER 
Spotted Horse and Three Feathers sit atop their horses. Three Feathers holds the reins to another horse packed with hides. An empty horse stands beside them... waiting for Glass. 
Glass is leaning over to New Moon and Little One... handing them the CRUDE BUFFALO CARVING he made from the wood. 
GLASS (taps his chest) Tatanka Wicasa. 
The little boys smile. Glass nods to Waki, then waves to Red Hawk and the Medicine Man. They return it... watch Glass climb onto his horse. 
Glass, Spotted Horse and Three Feathers ride out of the village. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY 
Glass, Spotted Horse and Three Feathers ride along a high ridge, surrounded by empty snow-covered wilderness. They have the world to themselves. 
EXT. CAMP - NIGHT 
Glass crouches over a shallow, five-foot long hole surrounded by deep snow. The hole is filled with small fires and rocks. And he's watching Spotted Horse and Three Feathers tossing rocks into their own matching holes, then dragging the dirt back into them. Spotted Horse throws a glance back to Glass, making sure he understands. 
Glass nods... pulls the dirt back in, covering the flames. He watches Spotted Horse spread a blanket over the warm ground, then does the same. He sits on the mound of dirt... leans back against a tree... feels the warmth rise up from beneath him. 
He nods to Spotted Horse, who is already resting under his blanket. 
GLASS Nice. 
SPOTTED HORSE (NODS) Nice. 
Glass pulls the buffalo hide around himself... keeping watch. 
SPOTTED HORSE (cont'd) Sleep. No Arikara. 
Glass nods... but still doesn't close his eyes. Spotted Horse tosses his knife over beside Glass. Glass takes it... nods to Spotted Horse. 
SPOTTED HORSE (cont'd) Me sleep. 
Spotted Horse rolls over, turning his back on Glass... trusting him with the knife. Three Feathers does the same. 
Glass just stares out into the night. 
INT. FORT UNION/BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT 
Dark and quiet... except for the SNORING of a few men. Fitzgerald sleeps on his cot. A shadow glides across him... hovers over his face. 
Fitzgerald's eyes blink open. 
CUT TO: 
FITZGERALD'S POV... 
...on GLASS STANDING OVER HIM... his scarred face calm and deadly... raising a knife to drive down into Fitzgerald's chest. 
FITZGERALD No... please. 
But Glass swings the blade. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING 
And Spotted Horse shaking Glass awake from his dream. Glass' hand flies up, the knife gripped. But Spotted Horse grabs his arm... stops it in mid-swing... holds it until Glass realizes it was a dream... relaxes. 
SPOTTED HORSE We go. 
Glass calms... nods. 
EXT. FORT BRAZEAU - DAY 
Just a small cluster of log buildings sitting along the banks of the Missouri. Dozens of tee-pees and tents are set up outside the complex. 
Spotted Horse stares at Glass a long beat, then... 
SPOTTED HORSE You spend your life hunting enemy. Enemy wins. 
GLASS It will be over soon. 
Then Glass pulls the Bear Claw Necklace off... hands it to Spotted Horse. Spotted Horse holds it... then proudly slides it over his head. 
GLASS (CONT'D) (IN SIOUX) Thank you. 
Spotted Horse raises his hand in goodbye, then spins his horse and starts away. Three Feathers does the same. Glass returns it... watches them ride off. 
EXT. FORT BRAZEAU - NIGHT 
Glass is in the trees beyond the tents and tee-pees... crouched on the ground... dragging the dirt back over the fire and rocks. He slides up onto the mound... feels the warmth, and smiles... just a little. 
EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - MORNING 
Glass rides a PAINT MARE along a ridge overlooking the river. Fort Brazeau stands in the distance behind him. 
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY 
Snowy and cold. Glass leads the line of riders through the snow. 
EXT. FORT UNION - EVENING 
But you can't tell if it's day or night through the blizzard. Fitzgerald, Pig, Anderson, Bridger, Murphy and Stubby Joe trudge through the snow in their snowshoes... finally reach the bunkhouse. 
INT. BUNKHOUSE - EVENING 
Anderson shoves the door closed against the wind... latches it. The men look worn and battered... wind-burnt faces, icicles in their beards. 
FITZGERALD I had enough of this cold as hell shit. 
ANDERSON What'd you figure when ya signed on outta that St. Louis whorehouse you was workin'? That you was headin' off to paradise? 
Pig snorts a laugh at Fitzgerald's expense. 
FITZGERALD I tell ya what I figured, I figured I'd be somewhere the piss wouldn't freeze before I got it outta my pecker. 
BRIDGER Figured wrong. 
Fitzgerald throws Bridger a glare... wants to throw more, but Bridger's returning the stare... hard... so Fitzgerald decides he'd better not push it. 
FITZGERALD Waste a time to check traps in this weather... while Henry sits warmin' his ass on the stove in his office. 
STUBBY BILL Why don't you go tell him that, Fitz? Then start your hike back to St. Louie. 
FITZGERALD Shit, I walked up here, I got no problem walkin' back. 
MURPHY Contracted for twelve months. We all did. 
FITZGERALD Henry can shove that contract up his toasty warm ass, or I'll do it for him. 
The others laugh at Fitzgerald's rambling. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) You don't think I will? 
The men shake their heads. Fitzgerald grabs his gloves... starts strapping his snowshoes back on. 
ANDERSON Just give that fat little whore you're so sweet on a couple extra bits... she'll have you thinkin' it's Spring already. 
The men laugh as Fitzgerald walks out... leaves the door wide open for the cold wind to pour over the others. Pig scurries over, shoving it closed. 
As the other men gather around a table to play cards, Bridger pulls a JOURNAL from under his cot... falls onto the cot, and starts writing. 
INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - EVENING 
Fitzgerald enters... looks around the empty office. 
FITZGERALD Hello? Captain? 
The place is empty. Fitzgerald eyes Henry's desk... then past his desk... to the SAFE... its door CRACKED OPEN... STACKS OF MONEY visible inside. 
Glass takes off through the forest. 
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT 
Glass hanging onto the paint mare, as she gallops through the trees... the animal's nostrils spread wide, pulling in all the oxygen it can. 
Glass glances back... sees SHAPES BEHIND HIM... HORSES... ridden by Elk's Tongue and eight other warriors. 
Glass digs his heels into the horse, squeezing every ounce of speed from her legs... pushing her toward the clearing up ahead... throwing another glance back... then looking in front of him, and realizing it isn't a clearing at all... 
...it's the edge of the world. 
The paint mare explodes from the trees, then runs out of ground... because she's just galloped off the side of a cliff. 
The horse sails downward toward a thick forest of trees, its legs flailing for something to stand on. 
Glass drops the rifle to grip the horse's mane, hanging on for what seems an endless fall. 
The mare SLAMS LEG-FIRST INTO THE TREE-TOPS with Glass still on her back. The Paint Mare SQUEALS as she drops into the snow-covered trees, carrying Glass with her. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS 
And the horse comes crashing through the branches... the massive limbs slowing her fall... snapping off as her body hits and twists... tosses Glass away. 
The Paint Mare continues her deadly descent, the trees tearing at her body... catching her head... SNAPPING her neck. 
Glass slams off a branch... tumbles to the ground with a thud. The Paint Mare hits the snow beside him... very dead. 
Glass struggles to breath... finally GASPS... sucks in the oxygen. He lays there a moment... stares up through the trees... 
...to Elk's Tongue and the others staring down from the top of the cliff... with no way to get to Glass. 
Glass rises to his knees... glances around for his rifle... lost. He flinches with what must be broken ribs... drags himself up, and staggers to the horse... pulls his knife and cuts the snowshoes from the back of the saddle. 
He throws the snowshoes over his shoulder... continues on, through the woods... alone... in the middle of nowhere... again. 
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY 
From high above... the small shape of Glass making his way over the snowy ground... heading toward TWO DISTANT SHACKS. 
EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY 
A makeshift town on the banks of the Missouri. Two ramshackle structures... the General Store and a tattered livery stable filled with horses. 
INT. FORT TALBOT/GENERAL STORE - DAY 
More like a saloon that sells a few supplies. A gang of TRAPPERS drink and play cards. A RUNTY MAN stands behind the counter, watching them... 
...until the door blows open, and in steps Glass. He pulls the fur hat away from his face, and what a sight he is... scarred face stiff from the cold... ice frozen in his beard. 
The room falls silent... everyone staring at Glass. Until TRAPPER #1 snorts a laugh. Glass limps to the counter. All eyes follow him. 
GLASS (struggling to make his frozen lips move) I'm Hugh Glass of... 
RUNTY MAN We don't serve niggers. 
Glass stares at the Runty Man a beat, then... 
GLASS Of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company on my way to Fort Union. 
RUNTY MAN I don't care if you was with Lewis and Clark headed for the new world. We don't serve niggers. 
GLASS All I need is a horse and enough supplies to... 
TRAPPER Ice musta froze up his ears, `cause he ain't listenin' to you, Cees. 
GLASS ...to get me to Fort Union. I can sign a draft made good by Captain Henry. 
The Runty Man just stares at Glass... grins a TOOTHLESS GRIN. 
RUNTY MAN What the fuck happened to your face, boy? You try to slice all the black off? 
STUBBY BILL'S POV... 
...on the blanket of fog hanging in the air... that same CRUNCHING, as a SHADOW APPEARS... growing clearer... a FIGURE walking... leading a horse behind him... appearing out of the mist like a ghost... GLASS. 
STUBBY BILL - STARES DOWN IN SHOCK... 
...sure his eyes are betraying him. But then Glass looks straight up at Stubby Bill, and there's no doubt. 
STUBBY BILL Jesus Christ. 
INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT 
Dark and quiet... just Pig's snoring rattling the silence. Suddenly the door kicks open... SLAMS into the wall... and there's GLASS' SILHOUETTE FILLING THE DOORWAY. 
GROANS from the awakened men... hands moving through the dark for oil lamps... turning them bright... until the room's fully lit... and they all see Glass standing there... eyes floating across the room, searching for a target. 
The men just stare back at him, like they're all part of the same dream. 
Except for Bridger, who's propped up in his cot like he's been waiting all night... waiting every night... for Glass to appear in that doorway. 
BRIDGER I'm sorry. 
Glass raises the stolen pistol... aims it at Bridger. And the young man doesn't flinch... almost as if he wants to make sure Glass doesn't miss. 
The other men just watch in silence, not sure what the hell's going on. 
Glass holds his aim on Bridger's face... a face that's haunted him... kept him alive. 
GLASS You took everything I had... left me to die. 
Glass walks toward Bridger, the gun still raised... each step of his feet on the wood floor is like the thud of an executioner's drum. 
MUMBLING from the other men, as they watch this ghost reach Bridger... stand over him, the pistol aimed down. 
GLASS (CONT'D) Why? 
BRIDGER I was scared of dyin'. (BEAT) But every day since, I've wished I had. 
Glass' finger tightens on the trigger, ready to make Bridger's wish come true. 
The rest of the bunkhouse watches this execution in wide- eyed, stone silence, afraid to move. 
GLASS There wasn't no `Ree that night, was there? 
A long beat, then... 
BRIDGER No. 
Glass PISTOL WHIPS BRIDGER, knocking him to the floor. And before Bridger can crawl away, Glass in over him... those aching, frozen fists beating mercilessly down on Bridger. 
And Bridger doesn't fight back... just does his best to cover up, but the blows keep coming, and Bridger's face is covered in blood... 
...just as Henry runs inside, half-dressed from where Stubby Bill awoke him. Henry grabs Glass... pulls him off. 
Glass spins... jams his pistol right in Henry's face. 
HENRY Hugh. Wait. 
Glass is crazy with rage... barely stops himself from pulling that trigger. But finally, he calms... his arm sinks, lowering his aim. He glances around the bunkhouse. 
GLASS Where's Fitzgerald and my rifle? 
HENRY Deserted two days ago. Along with about five hundred dollars of company money. (BEAT) Let's get some coffee to warm you up. (to Glass, but looking at BRIDGER) I wanna hear what happened. 
Glass looks back to Bridger... they hold a long stare, until Glass walks out. 
BRIDGER Wait. Please! 
But Glass and Henry disappear, leaving Bridger alone with all those eyes burning into him. Bridger looks to Pig, but Pig just lowers his eyes... can't even look at the boy. 
The men step into their boots and furs... file out after Glass and Henry... leaving Bridger alone in the bunkhouse. 
INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - NIGHT 
STUBBY BILL (cont'd) Just left this on his bunk. 
Henry takes the journal... flips it open. 
HENRY (READING) "Every day I think about what I done. I want to tell Pig and the others the truth but am afraid what they'll think of me. I look at Fitzgerald and want to kill him but am afraid to try. I am a coward and wish he hadn't been lyin about the Ree that night. I wish they had come and kilt us both." 
Glass considers the words a beat, then swings onto his horse. 
GLASS If I run across the boy, I'll send him back your way. 
Glass sees Henry on horseback, trotting toward them. 
GLASS (CONT'D) Where're you headed? 
HENRY Fitzgerald stole five hundred dollars. Rocky Mountain Fur Company wants him too. 
GLASS I can do this on my own. 
HENRY I know you can. But maybe you won't have to. 
Glass stares at Henry a beat, then finally just pulls his horse around... heads for the river. Henry nods to Pig and Murphy as he follows after Glass. 
EXT. ROCK LEDGE - DAY 
From above Fort Union. Our POV on Glass and Henry riding south along the icy river. 
And then we see our POV is Bridger's... standing along the ledge, loaded with all his gear. He watches the riders another moment, then turns... hikes the opposite direction... leaving Fort Union behind forever. 
EXT. FORT TALBOT/GENERAL STORE - DAY 
The Runty Man behind the counter. A few of the same Trappers drinking... playing cards. Just another day at Fort Talbot. 
The door swings open, and a FUR-COVERED FIGURE enters. 
RUNTY MAN We ain't got no food to spare, friend, if that's what you're lookin' for. 
The figure pulls back his furs, and we see it's Fitzgerald... cold and miserable. 
FITZGERALD Then what the hell have ya got? 
RUNTY MAN Whiskey and blankets mostly. Weather's held back deliveries. 
Fitzgerald throws a glance to the Trappers. 
FITZGERALD Gimme a couple bottles then. Goddamn ice shredded my boat. Been walkin' for two days. 
The Runty Man hands Fitzgerald the bottles. Fitzgerald pops one... gulps some down. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) How much for one of them horses out there? 
RUNTY MAN Horses ain't cheap this time a year. 
FITZGERALD Whatever the price, Rocky Mountain Fur Company's good for it. 
And those words stop everything. The Trappers all turn from their game. The Runty Man glares at Fitzgerald. 
RUNTY MAN You're the second son of a bitch come in here makin' that claim. And the first one left a bad taste. 
FITZGERALD That right? Well I don't know nothin' about that. Just that I need a horse. 
RUNTY MAN So did this other fella. So he stole one... along with Lange's pistola. 
Trapper #1 nods to Fitzgerald. 
FITZGERALD Fine then, I'll pay cash for the horse. How much? 
RUNTY MAN How `bout you pay for your friend's too. 
TRAPPER #1 And my shooter. 
FITZGERALD Wasn't my friend. 
Trapper #1 stands up. 
HENRY This was Fitzgerald camped here? 
GLASS Couple nights back. But these tracks aren't all his. 
HENRY He's travelin' with somebody? 
GLASS (shakes his head) Came in after. Prints are smooth. Mocassins. 
Henry throws Glass a look... he knows what that means. 
GLASS (CONT'D) Could be Sioux... Blackfoot even. 
HENRY But you figure they're `Ree. 
GLASS I don't figure nothin', Captain. But whoever it is, they're a good day behind Fitzgerald. 
Glass walks, leading his horse, as he follows the tracks away from camp. Henry rides after him. 
GLASS (CONT'D) And they're on his trail too, so we should keep it quiet... don't announce we're back here. 
HENRY You told me once you knew enough to keep away from the `Ree. 
GLASS I do. 
HENRY You figure this is smart then? 
Glass swings up onto his horse. 
GLASS You're welcome to head back, Captain. 
Glass trots off. Henry watches him a beat, then throws a glance into the trees... follows after Glass. 
EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT 
Glass kneels on the ground, building a fire-bed... dragging the dirt over the fire and rocks. Henry's under a blanket, watching him. 
HENRY What if we find Fitzgerald... and I ask you not to do this? 
Glass spreads a blanket over the ground. 
GLASS Don't ask me. 
Glass settles in on the warm earth. Henry just keeps watching him. 
EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - LATER 
ANGLE ON HENRY... 
...asleep under the blanket. O.S. RUSTLING sends his eyes flashing open. He raises up... rifle ready. 
He glances at Glass, who puts a finger over his lips. 
HENRY (WHISPERS) `Ree? 
Glass doesn't answer... just keeps searching the brush. 
Henry's groggy eyes dart around the night... spots MOVEMENT IN THE BRUSH. 
HENRY (CONT'D) There! 
GLASS Wait! 
But it's too late... Henry fires... BOOM... the shot explodes through the night... 
...and the DEER leaps away. 
Henry looks to Glass... shakes his head... sorry. 
HENRY So much for stayin' quiet. 
CUT TO: 
FITZGERALD - SQUATTING BESIDE A SMALL FIRE... 
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT 
Glass charges from the forest... spots Henry's horse standing in the trees... tears through the snow toward it... leaps off the still-moving animal in a fluid slide... hits the ground with his rifle ready... 
...and sees HENRY'S BODY face-up in the snow. 
Glass drops to a knee... scans the darkness, as he slides over to Henry... 
...and we see he's a bloody mess... a GUNSHOT WOUND in his chest leaking out onto the snow... HIS HEAD SCALPED... LEFT EAR SLICED OFF. 
Glass stands back up, turning in a circle, as he peers into the distance around him. But there's nothing out there. Glass SCREAMS in rage. 
He turns back to Henry... crouches down over him. 
GLASS You shouldn't a come. 
As Glass looks at Henry, he notices something... takes Henry by the chin, and tilts his head. And HENRY'S RIGHT EAR HAS BEEN CUT OFF AS WELL. 
Glass stares at Henry a beat, then squints out into the forest. 
GLASS (CONT'D) (repeating Spotted Horse's words under his breath) Arikara take right ear of Sioux. Left ear of whites. Not know what they take from you. 
EXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT 
Glass on horseback, leading Henry's horse behind him across the snow-covered meadow. Henry's fur-covered body is draped over the saddle. 
EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT 
A thick layer of ice covers the narrow river, thinning just a bit at the center. Glass kneels near the middle, chopping at the thick ice to get to the water beneath. He makes a hole... dips his canteen down into it, glancing around into the darkness. 
Then Glass turns... stares up a slope into the dark forest beyond... like he knows what's waiting for him there. 
He walks to the horses, tied in the trees at the base of the slope... Henry still laying across the saddle of his horse in his bloody furs. 
Glass SNAPS A BRANCH FROM A FALLEN TREE... looks back up that slope. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT 
OUR POV FROM DEEP IN THE FOREST... 
...watching from the shadowy brush, as Glass appears up over the distant slope... riding through the trees, with Henry draped over the horse behind. 
The forest is quiet... just the CRACKING of crusty snow and branches under the horses' hooves. 
Then BOOM... as the ANSTADT BARREL WE HADN'T SEEN BESIDE US FLASHES IN THE NIGHT... 
...and Glass tumbles off his horse. 
The horses prance around with a start, then settle... and then FITZGERALD RISES FROM THE BRUSH BESIDE US... eases toward the horses, reloading the Anstadt as he moves. 
He reaches Glass, face down in the snow... his furs covering him. 
And Fitzgerald has that rifle aimed, ready for Glass to suddenly roll over firing... 
...but Glass doesn't move. Fitzgerald nudges him with his boot, then crouches down... grabs Glass by the shoulder, and pulls him over... 
...and there's HENRY'S LIFELESS FACE HIDDEN BENEATH THE FURS... and that BROKEN BRANCH sticking up along his back. 
ANGLE FROM BEHIND HENRY'S HORSE... 
...on the REST OF THE BRANCH RIGGED TO GLASS' SADDLE to hold Henry upright... 
...and then what we thought was Henry flung over the second horse... MOVING... the bloody fur-covered arm lifting a rifle... the head raising up... it's GLASS... taking aim... 
...as Fitzgerald realizes what's happened... spins with the Anstadt... 
...to Glass laying across the horse... rifle dead set on Fitzgerald... BOOM... BOOM... both rifles explode... 
...Fitzgerald goes flying backward into the brush. 
Fitzgerald's wild shot hits Henry's horse, sending it rearing up, tossing Glass to the ground. 
But Glass is on his feet in a flash... reloading as he charges into the brush...

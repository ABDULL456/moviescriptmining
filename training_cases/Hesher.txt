HESHER 
Written by 
Spencer Susser & David Michod 
July 7th, 2008 EXT. STREET - DAY 
A small kid, TJ FORNEY (13), with a grubby worn cast on his arm, rides his BMX really fast down a street. He chases a tow truck towing a badly wrecked red Volvo. 
He struggles to keep up. The truck makes a turn. TJ follows, turning dangerously in front of oncoming traffic. 
The truck makes another turn. TJ turns with it, running straight into the side of a car pulling out of a driveway. He comes off his bike and is thrown across the hood. He picks himself up, stunned. The driver of the car gets out to see if he's hurt. 
TJ looks down the street to see the tow truck disappearing in the distance. He hurries back to his bike. He jumps on and continues after the truck. 
TJ gives chase. He gains on the truck. He can see it pull into a used car lot ahead - FAIR OAKS CAR CITY. 
EXT. FAIR OAKS CAR CITY - DAY 
TJ arrives at the car lot as the TOW TRUCK DRIVER is lowering the car onto the drive. TJ dumps his bike, out of breath. 
TJ This car has to go back. 
TOW TRUCK DRIVER Huh? 
TJ This car has to go back to where it came from. Put it back on the truck. 
TOW TRUCK DRIVER What are you talking about, kid? 
The driver continues working, unhooking the car from the truck. 
TJ Stop unhooking it. There's been a mistake. 
TOW TRUCK DRIVER I was told to bring it here. That's what it says on my work order. Talk to that guy if you've got a problem. 
The driver nods in the direction of LARRY TOWERS, who is approaching with 17 year-old DUSTIN HOWARD and another man, TONY, in dirty overalls. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
LARRY (to tow truck driver) Hey, Bill. 
Larry shakes the tow truck driver's hand. 
TJ This car has to go back where it came from. 
LARRY I beg your pardon? 
TJ It was brought here by mistake. 
Larry smiles at the little out-of-breath kid. 
LARRY And where was it supposed to go? 
TJ It wasn't supposed to go anywhere. It needs to go back where it came from. The guy who sold it to you made a mistake. 
LARRY (TO TONY) What's the deal with this car again, Tony? 
Tony flips through a stack of papers he's holding. 
TONY Ah let's see, we bought this car yesterday afternoon from a Paul Forney- 
TJ That's my dad. It wasn't his to sell. 
LARRY Well, it's his name on the pink slip, son. And that means it's his to sell if he wants. 
TJ Yeah, but I'm just telling you it was a mistake, OK, so it needs to go back where it came from. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
The car has now been lowered off the back of the tow truck. Larry moves away from TJ and approaches the driver. 
LARRY Thanks, Bill. (TO TONY) You got that work order there? 
Tony looks through his papers for the work order. TJ doesn't like being ignored. He moves around to the driver's side of the wrecked car and wrenches open the bashed-in door. He climbs behind the wheel, slams the door shut and locks the door. 
LARRY (CONT'D) Get out of the car, son. 
TJ ignores him. Larry doesn't have time for this. 
LARRY (CONT'D) Dustin, get him outta there, will ya? 
Dustin moves around to the open driver's side window. 
DUSTIN Come on dude, get out of the car. 
TJ turns the key and begins winding the window up. Dustin reaches in trying to unlock the door. 
DUSTIN (CONT'D) C'mon. Open it. 
Despite the glide and the wind in his hair he's slouching and looks depressed. 
EXT. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - MOMENTS LATER 
TJ rides his bike through an eerily barren unfinished housing development - half-built houses and perfectly sealed wide streets. 
Up ahead, he can see a small section of unfinished road - a big patch of dirt and rocks. He veers up a driveway to avoid it. He passes the dirt patch and then comes down off the curb back onto the road, trying to keep control of his bike. He hits the road and loses his balance. The handlebars twist and he crashes onto the road. 
He jumps up and yelps in pain, clutching his elbow. He looks at it. It's badly grazed. He yelps again, angry. He picks up a rock lying in the street and charges towards an unfinished house. He hurls the rock through its front window. Glass crashes down. 
A silent beat passes, and then the front door of the house opens and a late-20s, long-greasy-haired, wiry shirtless guy in filthy black jeans emerges. He has a baby moustache and a cracked front tooth. This is HESHER. He makes a determined line toward TJ. 
HESHER The fuck you think you're doing!? 
Before TJ can back away Hesher grabs him by the back of his T- shirt and drags him kicking and squealing towards the house. 
INT. HALF-BUILT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Hesher drags TJ into the unfinished front room. He slams TJ against an uncoated drywall. Hesher pulls a pair of garden shears from his back pocket and squeezes TJ's nose between the blades. 
TJ is terrified. He squirms. 
HESHER The fuck you think you're doing!? 
TJ Nothing. 
HESHER You got five seconds or I'm gonna cut your fuckin' nose off. 
TJ I was just, I was just going to school. I, I didn't know anyone was here. 
Hesher stares intimidatingly at TJ. TJ looks seriously scared. 
HESHER Bullshit. You're gonna fuckin' - 
Hesher is suddenly startled. His ears prick up like a rabbit. He hits the deck dragging TJ down with him. Their faces are close together. Hesher makes a very serious finger-to-mouth gesture to 'shhhh'. 
The SOUND of a car idling outside. Hesher listens. 
TJ is on his stomach, freaked. TJ looks around the room - a duffel bag, some beer cans, a few porn magazines, a weathered bass guitar and a sleeping bag. 
A car door closes loudly. Hesher peers through the window and sees a SECURITY GUARD inspecting TJ's bike in the front yard and then making his way toward the house. 
Hesher looks at TJ with serious and considered venom. 
HESHER (CONT'D) You just fucked me. 
Hesher snaps into action. With speed and precision he gathers his stuff together. He shoves it all his duffel bag. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
SECURITY GUARD (O.S.) Who's in there? 
Hesher lights the fuse on a stick of homemade dynamite wrapped in duct tape and throws it through the broken window. He then slips out the back door, leaving TJ face down on the floor freaked out and confused. 
SECURITY GUARD (O.S.) (CONT'D) What the hell- 
BOOM! Dirt sprays against the house and pours in through the window. TJ cowers, then hears the guttural roar of a van starting up. He hears the van screech away. 
SECURITY GUARD (O.S.) (CONT'D) Hey! Get back here! 
TJ jumps to his feet and looks out the window. A dirty black van screams out onto the road and tears away, spraying dirt and rocks in its wake. The security guard stumbles around, covered in dirt and disoriented. He rushes back to his car and gives chase. TJ lets them get away up the street, then bolts to the front door. 
EXT. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - CONTINUOUS 
TJ darts for his bike. He picks it up and rides off quickly. 
EXT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING 
Outside a public high school, kids mill around before class. Lots of noise. 
TJ rides down a path and clocks Dustin Howard, the kid from the car lot, who stands talking with friends by his car - a shiny 2007 YELLOW CONVERTIBLE MUSTANG. They spot each other. TJ quickly looks away (oh shit) and b-lines for the bike rack. 
INT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL / HALL - DAY 
TJ opens his locker. He pulls out a clear zip-lock bag with a rotten apple inside. He looks at it a moment then puts it back in the locker. 
A kid puts his hand on TJ's shoulder. 
KID 1 Hey, TJ. You're back. Welcome back. 
Another kid comes over, eating a bagel. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
KID 2 Hey, Teej. Welcome back, man. 
TJ nods, despondent, putting books into his backpack. 
KID 2 (CONT'D) How you feeling, man? 
COUNSELLOR Look, TJ. I know you've been through a lot and it's gonna take time to readjust, but as you know, the school can't tolerate this kind of behavior. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: COUNSELLOR (CONT'D) I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt this time, but you can't be starting fights. 
TJ I didn't start anything. He pushed me. 
COUNSELLOR What he did or didn't do isn't important. What's important is what you do, and how you react. Do you understand? 
TJ Not really. 
COUNSELLOR Which part don't you understand? 
TJ I don't understand the part about how it's not important that he pushed me and he punched me and he kicked me and he told me to suck his cock and now I'm the bad guy sitting in the office. 
The counsellor cuts him off. 
COUNSELLOR Hey, hey, hey. I do not wanna hear that kind of language in my office. 
TJ Yeah, but I didn't - 
COUNSELLOR Listen, I'm gonna cut you some slack, but you're gonna have to meet me halfway here. 
TJ shakes his head. He gives up on this conversation. He looks out the window. Hesher is out there - smoking and watching. 
TJ is suddenly unnerved. 
COUNSELLOR (CONT'D) I should really be suspending you, but I won't if you can promise me you'll put in a real effort... (noticing TJ looking ELSEWHERE) Are you listening? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
TJ Yeah, OK. 
EXT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL - LATE AFTERNOON 
It's after school. TJ walks out to his bike. It's the last one left on the rack. Only a couple of other kids are still on campus. TJ looks around. He jumps on his bike and quickly rides off. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 
TJ enters the house, which is quiet except for the sounds of a TV. There are no lights on so it feels dark. 
He walks past the TV room, the TV is on. Dad is on his back, fast asleep, mouth wide open. He barely seems alive, until he makes a small whimper. His mouth closes, he swallows, then his mouth drops open again. 
TJ picks up the remote control from a mess of empty pill bottles on the coffee table and switches off the TV. 
TJ walks past the kitchen and drops his backpack. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / GRANDMA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
TJ walks past his grandma's bedroom. The door is open. He gently knocks. She's sitting up in bed, reading. 
GRANDMA Hi, pumpkin. 
TJ Hey. 
TJ stands in the doorway. Grandma takes off her glasses. 
GRANDMA How was your day? 
TJ Pretty much sucked. 
GRANDMA Why sweetheart? 
TJ thinks for a moment. 
TJ I don't know. It just sucked. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Grandma looks at TJ with an empathetic nod. 
TJ (CONT'D) Do you want me to turn on the light for you? 
GRANDMA Do I look like I'm sitting in darkness here? 
TJ I don't know, maybe, a little. 
GRANDMA Maybe I need new glasses? 
She holds her glasses up for closer inspection. 
GRANDMA (CONT'D) Actually, I don't even know if these are mine. 
TJ Whose are they? 
GRANDMA Geez, I don't know. 
TJ Well, can you see better with them? 
GRANDMA Jesus, I don't know. 
TJ I don't know. It feels kinda weird, I can't tell. 
DOCTOR It will feel strange for a few days, but should start to feel normal again soon. Alright, lookin' good. I s'pose I should write you a note for school. 
The doctor writes the note. While he does so he makes chit chat. 
DOCTOR (CONT'D) How's your Dad doing? 
TJ Not great. I don't know. You should probably just ask him yourself. 
INT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL / CLASSROOM - DAY 
Mrs. Elsberry drones on from the front of the class. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
MRS ELSBERRY If we consider that dreams serve a metaphoric function in narrative fiction, as they do in life, what metaphoric function would you suggest the dreams here are serving? 
TJ sits in the back of the class, by the window. 
A little pebble hits TJ's desk. It bounces onto the floor. TJ looks around to find where it came from - and then another one hits him in the head. 
He looks out the window. Hesher is right outside the window. He takes the cap off of a large BLACK MAGIC MARKER. He holds it up to his nose and takes a long slow inhale. He exhales slow and long, staring hard at TJ. 
TJ looks around confused. Hesher recaps the marker, throws it hard at TJ and wanders off. The marker hits TJ, then falls to floor near his feet. He reaches for it. Mrs. Elsberry sees this. 
MRS ELSBERRY (CONT'D) TJ! What are you doing? Please pass that forward. 
TJ passes the marker forward. Mrs. Elsberry sets the marker on her desk. 
MRS ELSBERRY (CONT'D) You can collect this after class. 
She continues back to the chalkboard. 
MRS ELSBERRY (O.S.) (CONT'D) OK, so for our protagonist, are these dreams premonitions or desires or even nightmares perhaps? 
EXT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL - AFTERNOON 
It's after school. Kids are leaving campus. TJ wheels his bike across the school yard. 
EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER 
TJ rides his bike down the street. Dustin's YELLOW MUSTANG appears beside him. Dustin is boiling. 
DUSTIN You're fuckin' dead. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
We see that someone has drawn - in BIG BLACK MARKER - a crude picture of a body, sitting on a toilet with a big erect penis. The picture is drawn on the side of Dustin's Mustang door, so his real head lines up with the drawing. It's drawn in perspective so it looks like Dustin's head is attached to the naked defecating body to outsiders. The words 'SUCK MY COCK' have been scrawled beside the picture. Dustin swerves the car toward TJ, narrowly missing him. TJ cuts into a large super market parking lot, attempting to get away. 
Dustin accelerates ahead of TJ and screeches to a halt in front of him, cutting him off, almost hitting him. TJ stumbles and falls off his bike. His bike lands on top of him. 
Dustin jumps out of his car and starts beating TJ in the middle of parking lot traffic. TJ struggles just to protect himself, cowering on the ground and covering his head. Dustin tries to wrestle TJ free of the bike so as to get a clearer shot at him. He drags TJ by his T-shirt, ripping it off in the process. 
And then a WOMAN'S VOICE - 
VOICE (O.S.) Hey! 
Dustin ignores the voice. He continues beating TJ. 
VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Hey! Leave him alone! 
Dustin ignores again. 
VOICE (CONT'D) Hey! I said stop it! 
Dustin ignores one last time - a beat passes, then the woman, NICOLE (mid-20s), appears behind Dustin and jumps onto his back, bear hugging his face. 
NICOLE Leave him alone! 
Dustin shakes erratically, Nicole has a tight grip on him, but eventually Dustin manages to throw her onto the ground. 
DUSTIN What the fuck are you doing lady? 
Nicole picks herself up off the ground and holds up her fists like she's ready to fight. She doesn't look very tough. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
NICOLE What are you doing?! 
Nicole stands defiantly between Dustin and TJ. Dustin looks around at the scene he's created in the street. A man steps out of his car. Dustin realizes it's time to go. 
DUSTIN (TO TJ) I'm not finished, you fuck. 
He gets back into his car, slams the door and speeds off. 
Nicole watches him go, then helps TJ up. TJ is shirtless, scrawny, dirty and traumatized. 
NICOLE Are you alright? 
NICOLE I know, that's the point. I used to hate this crazy sour stuff, I don't know what happened. I just recently acquired a taste for it. I don't even really know what's in it, but I pretty much eat it all the time. And I'm sure it's making me fat. I just don't want to end up like those fat old ladies you sometimes see, you know, the really fat ones? 
TJ doesn't know what to make of her. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) I don't know why I'm telling you this. Anyway, I was secretly hoping that you loved these - 
Holding up the licorice, then taking a bite. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) So you could eat 'em for me. But now I can see you don't like em' and I'm kinda glad cuz it means more for me. I guess I'm sort of a hypocrite in a way. 
She smiles at that. TJ attempts to smile back, but he's so confused he ends up making a strange face. He awkwardly looks away. 
EXT. FORNEY HOUSE - DAY 
Nicole's car pulls up. TJ gets out and notices a dirty black van creeping slowly around the corner toward them. This makes him very nervous. 
TJ OK, thanks for the ride. I really appreciate it. 
He hurries to the door. 
NICOLE Hey! 
TJ turns. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) You want your bike? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TJ notices his bike still in Nicole's back seat. 
TJ Shit. 
TJ rushes back. He drags it out of her car. 
TJ (CONT'D) Thanks. 
He wheels it back towards the house. TJ goes around the side of the house to the back door. He knocks on the back door. Grandma appears at the door. 
GRANDMA Hi, TJ. What you doing around the back? 
Grandma lets TJ in. TJ is nervous. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
TJ I just, I dunno. I was just dumping my bike. 
TJ heads for the living room. 
TJ (CONT'D) (CALLING) Hey, Dad! 
GRANDMA Your Dad's gone to the supermarket, honey. Everything OK? 
TJ Ah, yeah, OK. 
But TJ isn't listening. He can't stop thinking about that black van. He exits the kitchen. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / FRONT DOOR - DAY 
TJ walks the hall carefully to the front door. He squints through the peephole. 
The black van is parked directly in front of the house. TJ can't see properly through the hole. 
He turns, to get a better look through the TV room window. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / TV ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
TJ turns to the living room. There is Hesher standing in the middle of the room with a dirty duffel bag over his shoulder. 
TJ is petrified. They stand looking at each other for a long moment. 
HESHER Where's the laundry room? 
TJ My dad'll be home soon. 
HESHER Where's the laundry room? 
TJ Why? 
HESHER You've got two seconds to tell me where the laundry room is before I tear your fuckin' head off and skull fuck you. 
TJ points to a door off the lounge. 
TJ It's through there. But why? You can't - my dad's gonna be home soon. 
Hesher stares at him for a second, then heads for the door. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / LAUNDRY - CONTINUOUS 
Hesher empties his sack into the washing machine. TJ steps into the room, wary. Hesher ignores him. 
Hesher continues flipping channels. He's not finding anything he wants. 
DAD Did you tell him he can't? 
TJ Yes. 
HESHER How come you only have four channels? 
Hesher gets up off the couch and exits the room. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Hesher enters the kitchen. Grandma is still crumbing chicken. 
He starts going through drawers right next to her. He doesn't acknowledge her. 
Grandma notices him, but not seemingly his cigarette, his state of undress or his complete stranger-ness. 
GRANDMA Hello there. 
HESHER Hello, old lady. 
His cigarette is done. He flicks it into the sink. It sizzles out. He opens another drawer. 
Dad enters with his grocery bag. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
DAD (TO HESHER) Can I help you with something? 
Hesher shuts the drawer. He's holding a fork. 
HESHER Nope, I'm good. 
He exits the kitchen. 
EXT. FORNEY HOUSE / BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 
Hesher strides across the back lawn in his underwear. 
TJ and Dad step out the door and watch him. 
Hesher reaches a telephone pole and climbs it nimbly like a monkey. At the top, he fiddles around with the fork, banging and wrenching at the cable box. 
He drops the fork to the ground and begins his descent. Only a couple of feet from the ground, he loses his grip and falls, crashing down into a thick bush at the base of the pole. 
HESHER Motherfucker. 
TJ and Dad stand staring frozen. 
Hesher lifts himself up out of the bushes, brushes himself off and heads back to the house. 
He walks right past them and back inside. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / TV ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Hesher sits back down on the couch and begins to flip through the newly acquired channels. He finds porn and drops the remote down beside him. He sits back and watches girl-on-girl action. 
TJ and Dad stand just inside the TV room, stunned, watching the newly acquired porn. 
Then a LOUD BUZZ marking the end of the wash's cycle sounds from the laundry room. 
Hesher gets up off the couch and heads for it. 
A stunned and silent (bar the porn noise) moment later, TJ follows. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Dad picks up the remote and switches the TV off. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / LAUNDRY - CONTINUOUS 
Hesher loads his wet laundry into the dryer. TJ's nervous. 
TJ So, ah, what are you doing now? 
Hesher slams the dryer door shut and wrenches the dial around. The dryer starts up loud. Hesher pretends he can't hear TJ. 
HESHER Huh? 
He turns and looks into the garage which is right off the laundry room. He points inside. 
HESHER (CONT'D) (LOUD) This your room? 
TJ (huh?) That's the garage. 
Hesher walks into the garage with his bag and slams the door leaving TJ standing in the laundry room with the noisy dryer. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
TJ enters and sits opposite. 
TJ I want to get the car back. 
LARRY Yeah, I figured that. You made it pretty clear the last time you were here, and I thought I made it pretty clear that I couldn't give it to you. 
TJ What do I need to do to get it back? 
LARRY The car's not for sale. 
TJ I want to get it back, though. How much do you want for it? 
Larry takes a breath. He doesn't want to be having this conversation. He counts the obstacles out on his fingers. 
LARRY I don't know. We're talking at least eighteen hundred dollars, not including taxes, registration, ADM, or dealer's fees. On top of that, you'd need a driver's license. I'm guessing you don't have one of those. You'd need valid car insurance. I'm guessing you don't have that either. But even if you did have these things, I still couldn't sell it to you because the car's not street legal. There's a million reasons why I can't sell it to you. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
For a second it seems Larry feels sympathetic toward TJ. 
LARRY (CONT'D) Look kid, I appreciate your enthusiasm, I really do, but I don't know what to tell you. You can't have the car. End of story. 
TJ churns all this over in his head. Larry thinks he's made himself clear. He motions to the papers on his desk. 
LARRY (CONT'D) Do you mind if I get back to it here? 
EXT. FAIR OAKS CAR CITY / OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
TJ walks out of Larry's office, forlorn. He walks across the showroom, head down, mumbling angrily to himself. 
He is stopped by a hand on his chest. It's Dustin. 
DUSTIN You're lucky I'm at work right now. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
TJ sits on his bike staring at a Ralph's supermarket. 
INT. RALPH'S SUPERMARKET - MOMENTS LATER 
Nicole is at the checkout, checking grocery items. She finishes with a customer and TJ appears next in line, with an ice cream cone. 
NICOLE Hi Sir, how are you today? Oh, hey. 
TJ Hey. 
NICOLE How's it goin'? 
TJ I got you a replacement ice cream. 
Nicole is a little taken aback. 
NICOLE Oh my god. That's so sweet, thanks. 
TJ smiles awkwardly. He hands her the cone. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TJ I paid for it over there. 
He points to the ice cream counter on the other side of the store. 
NICOLE Oh, OK. 
She holds the cone, not quite sure what to do with it, not quite sure how to take this kid. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) Thanks. 
TJ (NERVOUS) Sure, OK. See ya. 
TJ walks away. 
NICOLE See ya. 
Nicole watches him leave while a line of customers wait to be served. She smiles at the next customer, sharing the moment. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) (to next customer) Hi. 
She starts checking the customer's items, still holding her melting cone. She looks up out the door. She can see TJ outside, shaking his head and mumbling to himself. He feels like an idiot. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE - EVENING 
TJ enters the house. Dad isn't on the couch. He heads for the kitchen. He stops abruptly in the doorway. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Hesher and Grandma are at the counter. Grandma is baking an apple pie. Hesher is joyfully eating the apple slices she is preparing for the pie. They don't notice TJ. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Hesher shoves the money in his pocket, ignoring TJ. He unzips his fly and turns to urinate in the bowl. 
TJ What are you doing here? 
HESHER Pissing. 
TJ What are you doing at my school? 
HESHER I'm putting out a fire. 
TJ notices that he isn't actually urinating in the bowl. He's spraying his pee all over the seat and the lid and the wall and the floor. He finishes and zips up. He turns and shoves past TJ. 
Hesher looks at his hair in the mirror, then exits. TJ watches him leave, frustrated. He follows him out. 
INT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL / HALL - CONTINUOUS 
TJ sees Hesher disappear through the crowd. From behind, TJ is grabbed and dragged back into the bathroom. 
INT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL / BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
TJ is swung by his backpack across the bathroom. His backpack gets ripped off him and he goes down, sliding across the pissy floor. He looks up. It's Dustin, seriously angry. TJ leaps up and shoves Dustin back. Dustin stumbles backwards and trips over TJ's bag in the middle of the bathroom floor. 
Dustin falls and lands on his ass. He flounders embarrassingly. TJ knows he's a dead man. 
Dustin jumps up and grabs TJ by the back of his head. He shoves TJ's face down onto the filthy urinal tray. TJ struggles. 
DUSTIN You fucked my car, you little prick. 
Dustin holds TJ's head down in the tray. He shoves his face into the little yellow urinal deodorizer cake. 
DUSTIN (CONT'D) Eat the cake. 
TJ goes to lift himself up. Dustin punches him and then stands, putting his foot on TJ's neck, jamming TJ's head into the tray. He pushes the flusher. The urinal flushes all over TJ's face. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
DUSTIN (CONT'D) Fuckin' eat it. 
Hesher comes back into the bathroom. Dustin turns and looks at him, sensing danger. TJ looks up from the bathroom floor, eyes pleading for help. Hesher walks calmly towards TJ and Dustin. But instead of saving TJ, he walks straight past them and into the stall where he just completed his drug deal. 
He grabs his cigarette lighter from the top of toilet tank. He lights a cigarette, takes a long drag, blows the smoke in the air and walks back out again. Dustin watches him go. He puts another boot into TJ. 
DUSTIN (CONT'D) It's your birthday. Eat your fuckin' cake. 
EXT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
TJ waits with his bike in the street outside the school. He's beat up, wet and dirty. School's out. Most kids have already left. Dad pulls up in Grandma's maroon Buick. He gets out and opens the back door for TJ's bike. 
DAD You ready? 
TJ I don't wanna go. 
DAD It'll be good for us, Teej. C'mon. We'll be late. 
Dad takes TJ's bike and starts trying to fit it in the backseat. 
TJ I really don't want to go. 
DAD I don't think anyone ever 'wants to go' to these things. It's supposed to be good for us. That's the whole point. 
TJ stands watching his Dad struggle with the bike. 
DAD (CONT'D) C'mon. Give me a hand here. 
INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - DAY 
TJ and Dad sit on beanbags set out in a circle of about 12. Eight of these beanbags have people sitting on them - adults and a few kids. Some drink tea and coffee from little styrofoam cups. The tone is sombre. Dad and TJ look unsure of themselves. The chairperson of the meeting is MERYL, a 42 year-old grief counsellor. 
MERYL OK, so welcome everyone to the Transformational Grief Group. My name is Meryl. We should start off by going around the circle and introducing ourselves and briefly explaining why we are here. Hi Miss, would you please start us off? 
A heavy set woman, COLEEN, and her husband, JACK, sit on beanbags looking pale and sad. 
COLEEN We are the Bolder family. I am Coleen and this is my husband Jack. Our daughter Cynthia was murdered last year. (she chokes a bit) She was the victim of a violent attack that was unfair and sick. 
She can't go on. Her husband Jack sets his hand on her shoulder. She is able to hold back the tears. 
COLEEN (CONT'D) We are here because we need help. We lost our baby and we are broken. 
JACK Hi, my name is Jack. As my wife said, we're here hoping for some answers and just some help with the pain. 
MERYL Thank you, Coleen and Jack. Welcome. 
Weird silence. 
MERYL (CONT'D) (to Dad and TJ) Sir. 
Dad shuffles in his seat, looks around the group. 
TJ What are we doing? 
Hesher gets out of the van and slams the door shut. He goes around the back of the van and opens the back doors. He pulls something out and shuts the doors again. 
Through the side-view mirror, TJ can see Hesher filling up a big beat-up plastic gas container. He continues to smoke. 
INT. HESHER'S VAN - LATER 
Hesher brings the van to a quiet halt across the street from a suburban house. He kills the engine and surveys the area. 
TJ has no idea where they are. 
TJ What are we - 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TJ catches himself asking questions, but stops himself mid- sentence. He looks out the window and across the street and sees Dustin Howard's YELLOW MUSTANG parked in the drive. 
TJ (CONT'D) (OH SHIT) What are you doing? 
Hesher smiles to himself - he's looking forward to this. He opens the van door and climbs out. TJ is in a quiet panic. 
EXT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Hesher opens the van's back doors and grabs the container of gasoline. TJ appears beside him, still panicked. 
TJ Hey, seriously. What are you doing? 
Hesher makes his way across the street toward the house and the yellow Mustang. 
He pours gasoline all over the car. He does this with confidence - he's clearly had some practice. 
TJ (CONT'D) (loud whisper - too loud) Come on. This is insane. Let's get out of here. 
Hesher ignores him and continues dousing the car with gas. 
The porch light comes on. Someone peels open the front window curtains and looks out. TJ and Hesher drop to the ground behind the Mustang. TJ is terrified. He looks over to Hesher who is smiling, in his element, this is the happiest we have seen him. 
The curtains close but the porch light stays on. Unfazed, Hesher hops back up and empties the gas can onto the Mustang. 
Hesher stands a moment, admiring the car, saying a silent goodbye to it perhaps, as he pulls a single bent cigarette from his pocket. 
He straightens it, then lights it with a match. 
TJ (CONT'D) (QUIETLY FRANTIC) C'mon, man. Let's just go. 
Hesher takes one long drag on the cigarette, then calmly flicks the still lit match onto the Mustang. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Instantly, it erupts in flames. 
Hesher picks up the gas can and walks calmly back to the van. TJ follows still franticly looking back at the car and the house. 
Hesher gets in the van and throws the gas can into the back. 
TJ goes to the passenger door. 
It's locked. He wrestles the handle, panicking. 
TJ (CONT'D) Open the door! It's locked! 
Hesher starts the van and pulls away, leaving TJ stranded in the street. 
The front door of the house opens and a woman appears on the porch. Discovering the car in flames, she screams. 
TJ takes off, running across the street and through a neighbor's yard, down the side of the neighbor's house, with the woman on the porch screaming at him. 
WOMAN Hey, get back here! 
EXT. STREETS & BACKYARDS - NIGHT 
TJ runs. He jumps fences and slips down the sides of houses. He's running fast and breathing hard. 
He finds his way out onto another dark and quiet street. 
He stops. He has no idea where he is or where to go. 
Then - HEADLIGHTS appear at the end of the street. They bear down on him slowly. TJ stands immobile. He can now see it is Hesher's van, approaching slow and menacing. 
The van stops about 10 feet from TJ. A moment's stand off. 
Then Hesher sticks his head out the window. 
HESHER Get in. 
TJ You fucking ditched me. 
HESHER Get in the van, dude. 
TJ gets onto his bike. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
HESHER (CONT'D) Come on dude, don't be silly, let's just car pool. 
TJ clearly doesn't want to ride his bike home, but his is reluctant to go with Hesher. 
TJ Fine, just don't talk to me. 
HESHER I won't say shit. 
EXT. RALPH'S SUPERMARKET / PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER 
TJ and Hesher load TJ's bike into the back of Hesher's van. Hesher closes the back doors and they get in. 
INT. HESHER'S VAN - CONTINUOUS 
HESHER Look dude, I'm really sorry about the fire the other night - 
He waits a beat for TJ to respond. TJ is still mad, he says nothing. 
HESHER (CONT'D) That was totally out of control. Foolish and irresponsible actually. 
TJ looks at Hesher, doubting his sincerity. 
HESHER (CONT'D) I want you to have this - 
Hesher reaches into the back of the van and picks up a dirty magazine. He flips through some pages and shows TJ a photo. 
TJ pushes the magazine away, disgusted. 
TJ Get that away from me. 
HESHER Dude are you gay? I can't work you out. 
Hesher spots Nicole getting into her car. He drops the magazine on TJ's lap and fires up the engine. 
TJ spots Nicole. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TJ Hey, what are you doing? 
Hesher puts the car in gear and begins to follow Nicole's car out of the parking lot. 
TJ (CONT'D) Stop the car, I want to get out. 
HESHER Shush. 
TJ opens the door. Hesher grabs his arm. 
HESHER (CONT'D) You get out of this van, I'll rip your dick off and fuck her for you. 
Hesher means business. TJ is silent and back on edge. 
Nicole drives through the parking lot. Hesher follows her out of the lot and into the street. 
INT. HESHER'S VAN / STREET - MOMENTS LATER 
Hesher bobs his head in time with a heavy metal track that blasts from the stereo. 
TJ is ignoring Hesher, looking straight ahead at Nicole's car. Nicole stops at a red light behind another car. Hesher pulls up behind her and starts playing air drums to the track. 
The light turns green. Nicole hits the gas, running straight into the back of the car in front which hadn't started moving yet. 
HESHER Whoops. 
TJ's first impulse is to duck. Hesher watches the road. We hear the sounds of an angry DRIVER yelling at Nicole. 
Through the windscreen we see the guy get out of his car, yelling at Nicole. 
EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS 
Nicole is flustered and begins to cry. The driver is inspecting the smashed rear end of his car. 
NICOLE I'm sorry. I didn't - 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
DRIVER You just messed up the back of my car you stupid idiot. You need to pay attention when you're driving a fucking car - 
HESHER (O.S.) I think I can help here. 
Hesher is out of the van approaching on foot, smoking. 
HESHER (CONT'D) I saw the whole thing. The chick here was stopped and you reversed right into her. 
DRIVER What? 
DAD TJ! I don't want to hear one more word from you! 
TJ Fine. Fuck this. 
TJ sweeps his plate off the table. It goes crashing onto the kitchen floor, food everywhere. Grandma walks back into the room, looking worried. Hesher seems riveted, like he's watching the tennis. 
And then Dad sweeps his plate off the table. Crash, food, mess. He glares back at TJ. 
DAD That make you feel better? 
TJ wrenches his chair back and storms off. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) 
Dad sits a moment. With TJ gone, his reproach turns to shame. Grandma and Hesher make eye contact with each other. 
Dad gets up and leaves the kitchen. 
Hesher shovels some more food into his mouth. Grandma looks concerned. 
GRANDMA Did I miss something? 
HESHER (MOUTH FULL) Not really. Paul came in and said some dumb shit which TJ got angry about and so TJ smashed his plate and then Paul smashed his plate too but I got a feeling he smashed his one cuz he couldn't actually think of anything to say cuz he kinda knew TJ had a point and so now he feels bad about it and so he's gone somewhere. (takes another mouthful) I don't know where. 
Grandma contemplates this. 
GRANDMA Those boys have been through a lot. 
This makes Grandma very sad. 
GRANDMA (CONT'D) Sometimes I wonder if they're ever gonna smile again 
Tears well in Grandma's eyes. Grandma is quietly crying. 
GRANDMA (CONT'D) I just wish there was something more I could do. 
A long beat passes. 
Hesher doesn't know what to say. He pours applesauce on his food. Grandma looks around the kitchen at the mess. She shakes her head, takes a deep breath and starts cleaning up. She picks up bits of broken plate and takes them to the sink. Hesher watches her. 
HESHER This is delicious. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (5) 
GRANDMA Thank you, dear. 
Hesher holds up a piece of bacon covered in applesauce and licks off the sauce. 
HESHER What's green and slimy and smells like bacon? 
GRANDMA I don't know, dear. 
HESHER What's green and slimy and smells like bacon? 
GRANDMA A worm? I don't know. I'm going to lie down. I'm not feeling well. I'm very nauseated. 
HESHER Oh, OK. 
Grandma exits. Hesher finishes the last few bites of his dinner. He notices Dad's pill bottle. He reaches for them. He unscrews the lid and empties a few into his hand. He swallows the pills. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / GRANDMA'S BEDROOM DOORWAY - NIGHT 
Grandma lies in bed on top of her covers. Hesher enters the doorway and knocks lightly. 
HESHER Did you figure it out yet? 
GRANDMA Figure what out, dear? 
HESHER What's green and slimy and smells like bacon? 
GRANDMA No, not yet dear. Can you do me a favor? 
HESHER Sure, what? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
GRANDMA Will you please hand me that red tin on the cabinet dear? 
Hesher enters the room, grabs the tin from on top of the cabinet and hands it to Grandma on the bed. 
HESHER Kermit the frog's finger. 
GRANDMA What? 
HESHER Think about it... Miss Piggy. 
Grandma opens her red tin and takes out what looks like a rolled cigarette. 
HESHER (CONT'D) Woah, what's that? 
Grandma is stoned and sleepy and fading out. 
GRANDMA So is TJ the mouse? 
HESHER Maybe he is. 
GRANDMA Well then, what am I? 
HESHER You're an old lady. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (5) 
GRANDMA No, I'm a grandmother. 
HESHER Yes you are. And you know what grandmother? I'm gonna go on a walk with you in the morning. 
GRANDMA Oh, that's nice. Where are you going? 
HESHER I'm not going anywhere. I'm going with you. Around the block, I guess. 
GRANDMA Oh, OK, well have a nice time. I'll see you when you get back. 
HESHER No, I'm going with you. 
GRANDMA Ohh, OK, caauuse iii... 
Grandma has fallen asleep, but mumbles like she is continuing the conversation. Hesher smiles to himself, turns off her lamp and exits the room. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Hesher enters. He stands over what's left of the mess on the kitchen floor. He lights up a cigarette off the stove's flame and takes a long, slow drag, as he crouches down and starts picking up pieces of broken plate from the pile. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
Dad is asleep on the couch. A single shaft of bright sunlight lands on his face, causing him to stir. 
TJ nimbly reaches down to the table, covered with dirty dishes and pill bottles, and quietly picks up his dad's wallet. He removes an ATM card and places the wallet back where it was. He exits. 
EXT. FAIR OAKS STREET / ATM - MORNING 
Close on an ATM card, sliding into the slot. Fingers type numbers. A small stack of twenty dollar bills pours out. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TJ puts the money in a dirty envelope, pockets it and rides off on his bike. 
INT. FAIR OAKS CAR CITY - MORNING 
TJ walks through the showroom to Larry's office. Larry is on the phone. TJ stands and waits. Larry watches him. The kid isn't going anywhere. 
LARRY Yeah, why don't you just have him send them over... Sure... Scott, can you hold on a minute? (TO TJ) What do you want? 
TJ Can I talk to you? 
LARRY I'm on the phone here. Can you see that? 
TJ I need to talk to you. 
LARRY I'm on the phone. Wait outside. I'll be with you in a minute. 
TJ takes a seat outside the office. Larry closes the door. Dustin Howard appears. 
DUSTIN The fuck are you doing here? 
TJ I came to talk to him. 
DUSTIN What about? 
TJ It's none of your business. 
DUSTIN What do you wanna talk to him about? 
TJ ignores him. Dustin taps TJ's leg with his foot. 
DUSTIN (CONT'D) What do you want to talk about? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TJ Just leave me alone. 
Larry's door opens. Larry emerges from his office. TJ stands. 
LARRY What? 
TJ I got the money. 
LARRY What money? 
TJ The money for the car. 
TJ (CONT'D) Oh, Jesus. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
He disappears into the room for a second then emerges again in tears, his hands on his face. He heads back to the living room. 
TJ (CONT'D) What happened? 
DAD I don't know, she just, she just didn't wake up. 
TJ is in shock. He sits on the couch next to dad. They are both lost for words. Hesher stands in the corner with his head shoved between the walls. 
Hesher joins TJ and Dad on the couch. They are all raging inside, confused, lost and upset. They sit together in silence for a long beat, in the same boat for the first time. 
Hesher breaks the silence. He kicks the table over as he stands. 
HESHER I gotta get the fuck out of here before I hurt someone. 
He leaves through the front door, leaving it open behind him. 
TJ gets up in a daze and stands at the doorway looking out. It has started to drizzle. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / GRANDMA'S BEDROOM - DAY 
TJ stands in the doorway working up the nerve to enter. 
He enters and leans down to Grandma and tries to lift her onto the bed. She is heavy for him, he struggles. 
He gets her on top of the bed and looks at her for a moment. 
TJ breaks into tears. He leans down onto the bed holding Grandma, crying into her chest. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / TJ'S ROOM - DAY 
TJ sits on his bed and looks inside the envelope of cash. He closes it and seals it shut. On the front he writes: 'NICOLE'S PARKING TICKET FUND. LOVE TJ.' 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE / TJ'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Close on a small piece of paper with a hand written number. The numbers are dialed on a phone. TJ waits while the phone rings. Answering machine. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
NICOLE (ANSWERING MACHINE) Hi, it's Nicole. I'm not in right now, but leave a message and I'll call you back. 
Beep. 
TJ Ah, hi. It's TJ here. I, ah, I'm sorry to bug you, but um, I don't know, I guess I wanted to talk to you right now. I don't know. I have a present for you too, so maybe I'll just come drop it off or something, or ah, yeah... Um, OK. Bye. 
He hangs up the phone and exits. 
EXT. FORNEY HOUSE - AFTERNOON 
TJ walks out the front door. Dad is quietly sitting on the front steps wearing a T-shirt in the light rain. TJ goes to his bike. 
TJ What are you doing? 
DAD (SNAPPING TO) I don't know. Getting some fresh air, I guess. 
TJ It's starting to rain. 
Dad reaches out his hand and catches a few drops. 
DAD Yeah. 
TJ picks up his bike and rides. We stay with Dad as TJ disappears down the wet street. 
EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON 
TJ rides his bike. He rounds a corner onto Nicole's street. 
He jumps off his bike outside her building and wheels it inside the front fence. 
EXT. NICOLE'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 
TJ climbs the stairs of Nicole's building. As he approaches her apartment door, he hears loud, but muffled music. 
He knocks on the door. No answer. The music is really loud. 
He knocks again. No answer. He tries the door handle. It gives. 
He pushes the door open tentatively. 
INT. NICOLE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
TJ enters the apartment. The music is blasting. He looks around the living area. Clothes are strewn around. He sees Hesher's combat boots, T-shirt, jeans. TJ looks seriously troubled. 
We can faintly hear heavy breathing/moaning coming from the bedroom. 
TJ walks over to a door. It's an inch ajar. He pushes it open gently. 
It's raining hard. TJ storms out, just as Hesher is making his way up the path, his van parked on the street behind him. Hesher reaches out his arm to slow TJ. 
HESHER I wanna talk to you. 
TJ pushes Hesher's arm out of the way. 
TJ Get your fucking hands away from me! I told you, I never want to see you again. 
Hesher, at a loss, watches TJ grab a brick from the muddy garden and throw it through the passenger side window of his van. 
Hesher charges TJ. He throws him into the muddy garden and kneels over him holding him by the collar of his hooded sweatshirt. 
HESHER I fuckin' told you, leave my van out of this! 
Hesher lifts TJ up and slams him back down on the ground, knocking the wind out of him. TJ struggles to get away. 
TJ Let go of me! Fuckin' let go of me. 
Dad runs out the front door and pulls Hesher off TJ by the back of his shirt. 
DAD What in God's name - 
Hesher shakes free from Dad's grip and punches him square in the nose. Dad goes down hard. 
HESHER Don't fuckin' touch m- 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Without hesitation, TJ jumps on Hesher's back, bear hugging his face. They struggle for a beat, until Hesher manages to throw TJ off. He lands on the wet grass like a ragdoll. 
HESHER (CONT'D) Fuck you both! Motherfuckers! 
Hesher stands breathing hard, dripping wet from the rain, fists clenched. 
He turns back to his van, gets in, slams the door and peels away. TJ picks himself up out of the mud, grabs his bike and rides off in the opposite direction. Dad stands holding his bloody nose. He watches Hesher, he watches TJ. He is left confused and bleeding in the pouring rain. 
EXT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
It's raining cats and dogs. TJ stands outside Dustin's house, soaking wet with his hoodie pulled over his head, the garden shears in his hand. 
He walks around the side of the house and looks in the window. 
INT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
From TJ's POV outside, we see Dustin in the kitchen preparing a sandwich, one eye on the TV. He takes the sandwich to the couch in front of the TV and lies down. 
EXT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
TJ walks around the back of the house. He tries the handle to the back door. It's locked. TJ sees the dog door. He climbs through the flap, trying to be as quiet as possible. The TV is loud inside. 
INT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
TJ treads softly through the kitchen, soaking wet, shears poised. 
He walks through to the living area. He steps behind the couch out of Dustin's line of sight. Dustin's bare feet hang off the end of the couch. 
TJ ducks down. He opens the shears and carefully brings them down over Dustin's big toe. He squeezes them shut... 
Dustin squeals. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TJ Where's my car? 
DUSTIN What are you doing!? 
TJ Where's my fucking car? 
DUSTIN Are you crazy?! 
TJ You make me ask one more time, your toe's coming off. I swear to God. 
DUSTIN It's gone to the wrecker's. 
TJ What? 
DUSTIN The wrecking yard. 
TJ Bullshit. 
TJ squeezes a little harder. Dustin squeals a little louder. 
DUSTIN Why would I be lying? 
TJ Because you're a fucking asshole. Tell me where it is. 
DUSTIN It's gone to the wrecker's. I swear to God. 
TJ squeezes harder. Dustin squeals. 
He closes his eyes. 
INT. MIDDLE CLASS HOME - DAY 
FLASHBACK 
A doorbell rings. TJ runs to the door wearing the bottom half a suit. It's the pizza man. 
TJ Hi. (yells into house) Pizza's here, I need money. 
Dad, clean shaven, dressed in a suit, comes to the door and pays. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TJ (CONT'D) (yells into the house) OK, pizza's here. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) (YELLING BACK) Alright, let's do it. 
The woman comes down the stairs with her hair nicely done, wearing a fancy pink dress, it's TJ's MOM. 
MOM Teej, c'mon sweetheart. We have to go. We're going to be late. 
TJ What about the pizza? 
MOM We'll eat it in the car. 
She begins to do up TJ's tie. 
MOM (CONT'D) (TO DAD) Honey, will you grab the present? 
Dad picks up a large box off the side table, it's clearly heavy. 
DAD Holy crap, what is this thing? 
The three emerge from the house. TJ is wearing a suit and carrying the pizza box, Dad's carrying the heavy present, and Mom's carrying a bouquet of flowers and her purse. Dad stands at the door of a little white car. Clearly the box is too big. 
DAD (CONT'D) Ah, slight problem. 
Mom open the back of her red volvo which is parked right next to the white car. 
MOM We'll take my car. 
Dad does a heel spins around the white car and heads towards Mom's red volvo, never losing a beat. 
DAD Sure thing. 
INT. RED VOLVO - CONTINUOUS 
FLASHBACK 
Dad's driving, eating a slice of pizza. TJ is in the backseat, looking out the window, also eating pizza. Mom does her make-up in the visor mirror. 
DAD I think we should keep the new one and give them our old one. 
MOM That's a great idea. I'll be sure to let them know that our dirty old microwave is a gift from you. 
DAD Good. I'm not even sure they know who I am. 
MOM Honey, they're my friends. Please. 
DAD OK, I just don't understand why they get so many presents. 
MOM A microwave and a bottle of scotch is hardly a lot of presents. 
DAD And flowers. 
Mom half-laughs and shakes her head. 
TJ (mouth full of pizza) Mom can you turn on the radio? 
MOM Sure honey. How about some oldies? 
TJ Oldies but goodies. 
Mom turns on the oldies station. Dion And The Belmont's, "A Teenager In Love" plays. Dad sings along. 
The car hits a bump. Mom smudges her lipstick. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
MOM (TO DAD) Honey? 
She turns to Dad and we can see her lipstick has gone up onto her cheek. She smiles at Dad. They all smile at this, then - 
From out of nowhere, the car is T-BONED on the passenger's side. The impact is massive. The NOISE is deafening. Smashed glass. The car spins into the oncoming traffic and is hit by a delivery truck. The car flips. More deafening noise... 
INT. RED VOLVO / D&S WRECKING YARD - MORNING 
TJ wakes in the wrecked car at the wrecking yard. The loud sound of crunching metal continues. TJ is startled and disoriented. He realizes the car is moving. 
INT. FORNEY HOUSE - DAY 
Nicole stands at the door. TJ is unimpressed with seeing her. He stands in the doorway looking silly with his tie. 
TJ Hesher's not here. 
NICOLE I came to see you. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TJ Why? What do you want? 
NICOLE I wanted to tell you something. 
TJ stares at her. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) I didn't know if I should come here or not, but I couldn't stop thinking about it. I thought maybe if I came you'd still just be really angry at me and hate me, but then I thought if I didn't you'd think I didn't care and you'd hate me anyway, so I figured I might as well come, just in case, so here I am. 
TJ Yeah, well what do you want? 
NICOLE I want to apologize. I feel bad about what happened. I didn't take your feelings into consideration - 
TJ Yeah, well, whatever. It doesn't really matter. I have to go. 
NICOLE Yes it does. It does to me. I like you, TJ. We're friends. 
TJ looks at her, he doesn't really want to be mad at her. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) I understand if you don't want to be my friend. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. Sometimes I just... I don't know. I just wanted to come around and say all that, but maybe you still hate me and so it doesn't matter, but I just came round to say that, but I've said it now, so I should just go. So, OK, bye. 
Nicole walks off. She gets half way across the lawn before - 
TJ I'm sorry I broke your lamp. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
Nicole turns. 
NICOLE It's OK. 
TJ And I'm sorry I called you a fat prostitute. 
NICOLE It's OK. 
TJ You're not fat. 
Nicole smiles at this. 
NICOLE But I'm a prostitute? 
TJ I dunno. Maybe. 
They smile at one another. She crosses the lawn back toward TJ. She fixes his tie. She smiles again and then she leaves. 
INT. GRANDMA'S CAR / FAIR OAKS STREET - AFTERNOON 
Dad and TJ sit in the front seat. They are still angry and not speaking to each other. It is an unpleasant and uncomfortable ride. They both wear a suit and tie. 
EXT. FUNERAL HOME - AFTERNOON 
Dad and TJ drive into the funeral home parking lot in Grandma's car. A few people are milling around. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 
Dad and TJ enter the funeral home foyer. They look like they don't know where they're supposed to go. They are greeted by the funeral director from earlier. He talks in a soft monotone whisper. 
FUNERAL DIRECTOR Excuse me, Mr. Forney, may I have a word? 
He takes Dad aside. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT'D) I hate to have to do this here, but there's a couple of things I need to discuss with you quickly, if that's OK. 
DAD Ah, sure. 
FUNERAL DIRECTOR I know that we discussed your preferences for some aspects of today's service, including your choice of the cedar casket which the insurance company had covered. Unfortunately we were out of those and instead we've chosen a mahogany casket. Now there is an extra charge for the mahogany which I need to clear with you before we proceed. Is that OK? 
Dad looks confused. He doesn't know how he's supposed to respond. 
DAD Ah, I guess. 
FUNERAL DIRECTOR OK, great, thank you. If you could just sign here. 
The director hands Dad a fancy pen and holds out a dense order form for him to sign. 
FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT'D) Just at the bottom there. 
Dad's pen hovers. He doesn't know where he's signing. 
HESHER Um... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
The funeral director looks over to Dad, not sure what to do. He lightly puts his hand on Hesher's arm to guide him off stage. 
FUNERAL DIRECTOR I'm sorry, sir- 
Hesher pushes the funeral director's arm away hard. 
HESHER You touch me again, I'll rip your fucking head off and skull fuck you. 
The funeral director backs off, scared and unsure of what to do. 
HESHER (CONT'D) Ah, OK. Listen. I know you guys don't want me here and I don't want to fucking be here, but I'm not here for me, I'm fuckin' here for her- 
Hesher gestures to Grandma's coffin. 
HESHER (CONT'D) - and I'm not fuckin' here to say goodbye or have my farewell or whatever the fuck you assholes call it - this is not how I want to say goodbye to someone I like - in this shit-hole with these- 
Hesher points to the funeral director. 
HESHER (CONT'D) - fuckin' assholes. 
TJ's dad stands and interrupts. 
DAD OK, this is enough- 
HESHER Yeah, well why don't you shut up for a second and listen cause I'm going to say what I want to say and then you'll never see me again. Alright?! 
There is a beat of silence. No one knows what to say or do. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) 
HESHER (CONT'D) I'm here cause she's been trying to tell you guys something, but you don't want to listen... so I'm gonna fuckin' break it down. 
Hesher takes a long pull from his beer can. 
HESHER (CONT'D) I pulled the gas tank from an old Chevy and I wanted to fuckin' blow it up, so I did. I didn't think about the millions of bits of metal that were gonna fly in every direction. I almost killed myself. I woke up in a hospital. I couldn't remember what happened and then this doctor at the end of my bed said 'son', and I said, 'don't call me son you fuckin' cunt', then he said, 'you blew off your nut'. Some shrapnel had penetrated my left scrotal sack and ripped the furry sucker right off. My left fucking nut was gone, just like that. 
Hesher makes a magic disappearing arm gesture, spilling a bit of beer on the floor. 
HESHER (CONT'D) I went crazy. I assaulted a nurse, a doctor or two, I can't remember. I got arrested. I got sent to juvie. But all I could think about day and night was my missing fuckin' nut. I couldn't eat or sleep, I just wanted my fucking nut back. I had to get out of there and find it, so I busted out of juvie and went lookin' for it. I looked for days, but didn't find shit. 
The tiny crowd listens, half offended, half intrigued. 
HESHER (CONT'D) And then one night I was taking a shit and I was just staring down at my balls, looking at my flabby piece of sack where my left nut used to be and then I noticed my right nut, for like the first time. My right nut was just sitting there, totally happy, just hanging out. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (5) HESHER (CONT'D) All this time I'd been driving myself crazy thinking about my missing nut and not thinking about the nut I still had all along. And I realized, I've still got a nut. I've still got one good nut. God or the Devil or whoever left me with one good nut. At least I didn't lose both my nuts. I've still got one good nut and it works, and my dick works too. 
Hesher looks up at TJ and Dad, sad and imploring, he's made his point. They look back at him stunned. 
HESHER (CONT'D) You lost your mom. You lost your wife. I lost a nut. 
Hesher takes the last swig of his Budweiser. He sways, drunk. This soaks in with the crowd. 
HESHER (CONT'D) Fuck this. 
Hesher throws the can down. He goes to stomp on it. He misses and stumbles, crashing into the microphone podium, knocking it over and falling in a heap with it. He starts puking on the stage. A couple of old ladies are horrified. 
The funeral director motions to his assistants that now is the time to move the coffin out. Hesitantly, they obey. Hesher looks over from the floor. 
HESHER (CONT'D) Leave her alone. We're not finished yet. 
FUNERAL DIRECTOR (POLITELY) Unfortunately sir, we need to be. 
They continue to push the coffin away. Hesher lifts himself up and wipes the vomit from his face and steps toward the coffin. The funeral workers back away. 
HESHER I told Grandma I was going on a walk with her and I'm gonna do it! 
Determined, Hesher leans down and unlocks the wheels of the coffin stand. 
Dad stands, not exactly sure what to do. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (6) 
With purpose Hesher pushes the coffin down the stage ramp and down the center aisle of the room, toward the exit. He turns to TJ - 
HESHER (CONT'D) You promised Grandma you'd go on a walk with her. This is your last chance. 
Hesher seems overcome with emotion, he continues pushing the coffin toward the exit and out through the doors. 
TJ and Dad watch him, unsure. After a moment, They follow him to the door. They stand at the doors watching Hesher push the coffin out into the parking lot. 
TJ is overcome with emotion, his eyes well with tears. He heads across the lot and catches up with Hesher, joining him on the walk. Dad watches for a beat, his eyes well up too, then he does the same. 
All three are now walking together through the funeral home parking lot with Grandma's coffin. They don't speak. It's a release. Other mourners watch from the doorway. 
EXT. FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS

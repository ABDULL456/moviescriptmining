THE HEBREW HAMMER 
Written by 
Jonathan Kesselman 
Over BLACK, we hear the first few bars of Jingle Bells. The music morphs into an OMINOUS SCORE. 
With a thunderous BOOM, comes a TITLE CARD reading "HANUKKAH PAST." 
EXT. PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY 
We start on JESUS ON A CRUCIFIX, and then violently CRANE down to reveal MORDECHAI (10), a timid little Hasidic boy standing nervously at the foot of the statue. 
Behind Morty is a wall with the graffiti phrase "HANUKKAH IS 4 HOMOS" scrawled across it. He clutches his Sandy Koufax lunchbox tightly as he looks off into the distance. He's got quite a large bulge in his pants for a child his age. 
We see a menacing, EXTREMELY WIDE ANGLE shot of the school. Superimposed over the picture are the words, "ST. PETER, PAUL, AND MARY PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL." 
Mordechai takes a deep breath, and walks towards the school. 
EXT. SCHOOLYARD - MOMENTS LATER 
Mordechai walks past a row of bleachers occupied by FOUR GENTILE CHILDREN. 
GENTILE BOY 1 Hey Mordechai, look. I dropped a penny. 
He drops a penny. The other children cackle. 
The Gentile Girl next to him holds up a bag of bagels. 
GENTILE GIRL 1 Hey Mordechai. Want a bagel? 
Gentile Boy 1 feigns choking. 
GENTILE BOY 2 Hey Jew nose, save some oxygen for us. 
More laughter. Morty attempts to take it all in stride. We PUSH into GENTILE GIRL 2, a severe looking puritanically dressed child as she turns to face the camera. 
GENTILE GIRL 2 Hey Morty, my mom says that unless your people wise up and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior you're all going to burn in hell. 
Dead silence. The other children exchange "Now that went a little over the line" looks. 
The silence is broken by the sound of the SCHOOLBELL. Morty gathers himself, and walks off. 
INT. CLASSROOM - LATER 
As Morty holds a small gift wrapped box in his hands we hear a tinny version of the song Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel. 
He tears open the wrapping paper to reveal a DREIDEL. He looks at his gift, and then looks off-screen. We PAN with his look to reveal... 
A group of Christian children congregating around a large, garishly decorated Christmas tree. A very Vegas Merry Christmas sign flashes as a larger-than-life HI-FI version of the Christmas song Jingle Bells blares. The children festively slap high fives as they open their presents. 
We cut to a SLOW-MOTION CU of Gentile Boy 1 enamored with his brand new ATC motorbike. 
We cut to a SLOW-MOTION CU of Gentile Girl 1. She wears an "I Love Jesus" T-shirt and holds an adorable dog with a bow affixed to its head in her arms. It licks her on the face. 
We cut back to Mordechai. He looks down at his pathetic excuse for a present. He's on the verge of tears. 
Gentile Boy 1 calls to Mordechai as he drives his ATC. 
GENTILE BOY 1 Hey everybody! Look what Mordechai got. Nice spinning top Morty. 
The other children take notice of Mordechai's gift and begin to laugh. 
Mordechai is crushed. MRS. HIGHSMITH (40's), an incredibly Waspy teacher puts down her copy of 'Modern W.A.S.P.,' and appears genuinely concerned by the teasing Mordechai has weathered. She walks over to comfort him. 
MRS. HIGHSMITH Now, now class let's not make fun of Mordechai's spinning top. We need to all learn the importance of tolerance and understanding. Isn't that right Mordechai? 
MORDECHAI Yes Mrs. Highsmith. 
The pubic area of their dresses moisten in synchrony. 
The Hammer winks back. 
An OLD WOMAN calls to the Hammer from the window of a second story flat. 
OLD WOMAN Hammer, why don't you come eat by us for Shabat. My Miriam is all grown up now. God willing, you should settle down and marry. 
We punch in to a CLOSE UP of a demure Miriam as the Hammer takes stock of the goods. She is an atrociously ugly girl wearing orthodontic headgear, and bespectacled with a pair oversized librarian's glasses. 
The Hammer shakes off his wave of nausea. 
HAMMER Thanks for the invite Mrs. Kleinman, but right now G dash d's the only one for me. 
OLD WOMAN I can dig it. 
The Hammer continues on down the street. The old woman and Miriam are framed in the BG. 
OLD WOMAN (CONT'D) Hammer, you're the baaddest Hebe this side of Tel Aviv. 
The Hammer stops for a second and smiles at the compliment. 
HAMMER (To himself) Shabat Shalom! 
He walks off frame. 
EXT. GHETTO ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER 
Some TEENAGE GENTILE BOYS play keep away with a yarmulke belonging to SHLOMO, another young Hasidic kid. 
SHLOMO Give it back! Give me back my yarmulke! 
TEENAGE GENTILE Hey Teddy, throw me the frisbee. 
TEDDY (the non-speaking teen Gentile) throws the yarmulke, and we FOLLOW it as it spins towards another TEENAGE GENTILE. The other Teenage Gentile excitedly extends his hands to catch, but right before it reaches him another hand comes into frame and snatches it. He looks up, and we cut to his... 
POV as we tilt up to reveal The Hammer. He looks pretty damn big and pissed off from this angle. 
The Teenage Gentile  begins to shake and stammer. 
TEENAGE GENTILE (CONT'D) We...we were going to give it back. I swear to god. 
HAMMER Did you just take god's name in vain? 
TEENAGE GENTILE No, no. It...It's not like that. We were just about... 
HAMMER Just about to leave, right? 
TEENAGE GENTILE Yeah, yeah, that's right. We were just about to leave. C'mon Teddy. 
The two run off. 
The Hammer looks down to Shlomo. His spirit seems broken. 
HAMMER You alright? 
SHLOMO I guess. Sometimes I wonder why I even bother praying to one god. 
HAMMER Hey, hey! Be proud of who you are. You're a bad, bold, big-nosed, biblical brother. You feelin' me? 
The kid's morale is boosted. 
SHLOMO Yeah. You're right. 
HAMMER Aveenooh Shalom Alechem little brother. 
The Hammer pounds his fist into his chest ala the Black Panthers. The kid returns the gesture. 
SHLOMO Thanks Hammer. 
As Rudolph's nose dims, so do the lights in the room. Santa picks up a remote in his hand, and turns on a SLIDE PROJECTOR. 
SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D) Over the course of my career as Santa Claus, I've made it my mission to ensure that Jews, Christians, and African Americans could all observe their respective holidays in harmony. 
We see a slide of THE HEBREW HAMMER, an African American man (Mohammed), and Santa Claus arm in arm below a banner in a mall reading "HAPPY HOLIDAYS!" 
SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D) I was responsible for pushing the Happy Holidays Ordinance, in which all Merry Christmas signage was replaced by the Trans-relgious and inoffensive phrase 'Happy Holidays.' 
We see another slide in which an assembly of SCHOOLCHILDREN are singing. 
SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D) It was nearly a decade ago, in conjunction with our friends in the Jewish and African American communities that I supported a bill that mandated that 'Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel' and 'I'm dreaming of a bright Kwanzaa' be taught and sung in elementary schools along with the Christmas standards 'Frosty The Snowman', and 'Deck The Halls.' Which is why upon examination of my annual naughty and nice list it shocked me to discover that my own son, Damian... 
Damian, preoccupied with the cigarette he's attempting to light, looks up in response to his name. A brown bagged bottle of booze now sits on the table in front of him. We can see Santa and the reindeer in silhouette on the slide projection screen behind him. 
SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D) The heir to the Red Suit could be so filled with hate. 
Santa addresses Damian. 
SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D) Damian, when I learned of your ludicrous scheme to wipe out Hanukkah, my first reaction was one of disgust. Now, I'm only filled with sadness and disappointment. Disappointed that I failed to teach you the true meaning of Christmas. What do you have to say for yourself? 
We being a SLOW PUSH into Damian as he ponders the question. The cigarette dangles from his lips. 
Rudolph nods to Blitzen. Blitzen returns the gesture with a nod of acknowledgment. 
With a slow and measured pace Damian says... 
DAMIAN Ho. Ho. Ho. 
On the slide projector screen behind Damian, we see the silhouetted images of Blitzen and Rudolph goring Santa through the chest with their antlers. Damian cringes. 
Blood trickles from Santa's mouth, and with his last breath he utters the words... 
SANTA CLAUS Et tu, Blitzen? 
Santa falls out of frame with a thud. Standing behind him with bloodied antlers is Blitzen. 
Damian walks over to the newly deceased Santa, takes his bloodstained Santa's hat, and put it on his own head. From this point on in the screenplay, Damian will now be referred to as SANTA. 
The elves in the room, in various stages of shock, stare at their new master in horror. 
SANTA What are you fucking midgets looking at!? Get back to work! We have Hanukkah to destroy! 
STAR OF DAVID WIPE TO: 
EXT. THE JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - DAY 
A building resembling the Pentagon with the exception that it's shaped like the Star Of David. Superimposed over the picture are the words, "JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE." 
INT. THE JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - DAY 
A smoky chamber reminiscent of the Senate or the United Nations. A GIANT BANNER reading "HANUKKAH NOW!," illustrated with a Hasid in silhouette with his fist raised, covers the back wall behind the men. 
As with the Senate House Committee, various factions of the JDL sit behind plaques describing the group they represent. We see members from: The Anti-Defamation League, Jews Against Drunk Driving, etc. A chair belonging to THE COALITION OF JEWISH ATHLETES is empty. 
The floor is chaotic. The JDL Chief bangs his gavel and yells... 
CHIEF Gentleman! 
His pleas for silence are ignored. 
CHIEF (CONT'D) Gentleman! Please! 
Still chaos. He flips a light switch on and off a few times as he says... 
CHIEF (CONT'D) Sheket B'vakasha! Sheket B'vakasha! 
The entire hall responds in unison... 
HALL Hey! 
ADL CHAIRMAN Only problem is, ever since we kicked him out, he wants nothing to do with us. There's no way we can persuade him to come back. 
Esther lifts her skirt a few inches. 
ESTHER Perhaps I can persuade him. 
STAR OF DAVID WIPE TO: 
INT. HEBREW HAMMER INVESTIGATIONS - PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY 
A shoddy low-rent office replete with Film Noirish lighting via the blinds. The Hammer fiddles with a dreidel as he sits with his feet propped up on his desk. His Shtreml hat is skewed to one side and a toothpick dangles from his lips. 
HAMMER (V.O.) It was the day before Hanukkah when she strolled into my office. 
There is knock at the door. 
HAMMER (CONT'D) Come in. 
The door opens to reveal a long denim skirt covering every possible inch of flesh. We tilt up the length of the skirt to reveal Esther. She is breathtakingly sexy. 
The Hammer quickly removes his feet from the table. Esther approaches his desk and sits. 
ESTHER Mr. Jefferson Carver? 
HAMMER Please, call me Mordechai. 
HAMMER (V.O.) (CONT'D) From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times... 
ESTHER Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to? 
HAMMER (V.O.) Oh, the things I would do to her if I had the... 
The Hammer attempts to press stop on his tape recorder, but accidentally FAST FORWARDS to another part of the tape. We hear the sound of SEXUAL INTERCOURSE. The Hammer scrambles for the STOP button. 
HAMMER (CONT'D) Client notes. Sorry. (Beat) What can I do for you? 
ESTHER My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you. 
HAMMER How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on? 
ESTHER (Annoyed) Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively. 
The Hammer makes the realization. 
HAMMER Your mother? Oh. Whoops. 
ESTHER Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of. 
HAMMER I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good friend, but my days... 
The Hammer stops himself and glances over Esther's shoulder. 
In the doorway stands a BLONDE BOMBSHELL in a mink coat. 
BLONDE BOMBSHELL Mr. Hammer? I'd like to hire you to put a tail on my husband. I think my life might be in danger. I think he wants to kill me. 
HAMMER Sorry Shiksa, I think you got the wrong office. I'm the Hebrew Hammer. Mike Hammer's down the hall. 
The Blonde Bombshell is confused for a moment. 
BLONDE BOMBSHELL Oh. 
She leaves. 
HAMMER Listen. Esther, you seem like a nice girl, so I'm only gonna say this once. I no longer affiliate myself with that organization. The politics there were brutal. Besides, I've already got a full case load. 
Esther looks down at his desk. 
We cut to a shot of the Hammer's In/Out Box. Both are completely empty, and thickly coated with spiderwebs. 
MRS. CARVER (Hysterically) Nonsense young man. You'll eat everything in front of you. After all, there are people starving in China. Isn't that right Mun Chi? 
We cut to a previously unseen end of the table. MUN CHI, a skin and bones elderly Chinese man looks up in response to his name. The plate directly in front of him is still pristine. He mutters something in Chinese and then reaches for a chicken wing on a platter in the middle of the table. 
Mrs. Carver smacks his hands away with a wooden salad spoon and then glares at him. 
MRS. CARVER (CONT'D) Not until Mordechai finishes everything in front of him. 
Mrs. Carver directs her piercing stare at the Hammer. 
MRS. CARVER (CONT'D) Mordechai!? (Beat) So, Esther, how did you and Mordechai meet. You know they call him the Hebrew Hammer for a reason. 
Esther coughs up some of her food. The Hammer interjects. 
HAMMER Mom! Esther works for the JDL. They sent her to try and recruit me back to save Hanukkah for them. What she doesn't seem to understand is that nothing, not even god himself could convince me to ever work for them again. 
ESTHER But Hanukkah's in dan... 
The Hammer cuts her off. 
HAMMER Not my problem. If you'll excuse me now, I need to use the bathroom. 
He stands and leaves. 
Mrs. Carver stares lovingly at Esther. 
MRS. CARVER You like my Mordechai, yes? 
ESTHER He's...he's very nice. (Desperately) But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me. 
MRS. CARVER Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl. (Beat) I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai. 
ESTHER (Confused) What do you want me to do? 
MRS. CARVER He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there. 
Esther begins to choke again. 
MRS. CARVER (CONT'D) Is this something you could do for me? 
The Hammer calls out from the bathroom. 
HAMMER Mom, where do you keep the plunger? 
MRS. CARVER (Yells) It's under the sink by my tampons! 
Esther appears panicked. 
MRS. CARVER (CONT'D) So, do we have a deal? 
In the BG, we hear the toilet FLUSH. The Hammer begins his walk back to the table. 
ESTHER Deal. 
The Hammer sits down. 
HAMMER So, what did you two ladies discuss while I was gone. 
Esther begins to speak, but Mrs. Carver interrupts. 
MRS. CARVER I was just telling your nice friend Esther about how I used to have such a problem with the gas. (To Esther) So, once I started taking two charcoal pills before I ate, the gas cleared itself right up. 
Esther plays along. 
ESTHER Thanks. That's...good to know. 
Mrs. Carver turns her attention towards her son. 
MRS. CARVER Mordechai. Do you love your mother? 
HAMMER Mordechai Baruch Netanyahoo. 
The vault-like gate slides open in a futuristic manner, and the Hammer steps in. The gate shuts behind him, and he finds himself in an all white room. A microphone is placed by another massive door directly in front of him. 
COMPUTERIZED VOICE Please state the six dishes found on the Passover Seder plate in alphabetical order? 
HAMMER Beitzah, Charoset, Chazeret, Karpas, Maror, and Zeroa. 
The second door slides open, and Morty steps forward into the next room. Inside this room lies a single violin in a case. 
COMPUTERIZED VOICE Please demonstrate musical aptitude. 
The Hammer picks up the violin and begins to play 'Hava Nagila.' He's pretty damn good at it. The next door slides open, and Hammer steps forward into yet another room. 
A drape, about four feet high off the floor, is stretched into a semi-circle against the wall of the room. 
COMPUTERIZED VOICE (CONT'D) Please step forward and remove your undergarments. 
The Hammer steps inside the drape, and drops his pants. 
A panel on the wall opens, and a metal probe heads for his shmekel. He is clearly uncomfortable with this bit of testing. 
HAMMER Oooh. That's cold. 
COMPUTERIZED VOICE Circumcision confirmed. 
The door slides open, and the Hammer quickly pulls his pants up as he steps into the next room. The room is completely empty with the exception of a one way mirror on the front wall by the door. 
COMPUTERIZED VOICE (CONT'D) Final test initiated. 
Nothing happens. The Hammer waits a few seconds, but quickly becomes agitated. 
HAMMER Hello? Can anybody hear me? I think this machine is broken or something. Hello? (To himself) This is ridiculous! I didn't even want to come here. I shlep all the way out to the middle of nowhere, for lord knows what purpose, and... 
We cut to the OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR. The Chief observes the Hammer as he continues to whine. Next to them, a METER with the label "WHINING SCALE" slowly grows in magnitude as the Hammer continues to rant. The meter bars go from red to yellow in color. 
HAMMER (CONT'D) I am so unhappy with this situation. Why Mordechai? Why do you always feel it necessary to do what other people want you to do? Why can't you be your own man... 
CHIEF Come on. Come on. 
The meter bars switch from yellow to green, finally passing the '0  - Jewish' mark. 
CHIEF (CONT'D) (To himself) He's still got it. 
Back inside with the Hammer, the doors slide open, revealing the Chief to the Hammer. 
CHIEF (CONT'D) Welcome back Hammer. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
The Hammer and the Chief make their way down the hallway. 
CHIEF Since you've been gone Hammer, some things have changed around here. Our agents are now subjected to a strict physical training regiment. Take a look. 
The Chief stops at a door labeled "Goldsmith's Gym." The sign is illustrated with a picture of a Hasidic Jew squatting a dumbbell a la Gold's Gym. The Chief opens the door. 
INT. KARATE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Inside, about FIVE or so HASIDS decked out in white Karate gi's stand facing the door. By the front door, A GROUP LEADER, notices the Hammer, and walks towards the door. He bows with his hands folded in front of him as a sign of respect. 
The Hammer returns the gesture. 
The Group Leader shakes his head in one last respect, and then turns away from the Hammer as he goes back to his class. On the back of his gi is written the word "JEW-DO." 
HAMMER A minion practicing Jew-do, the deadly fighting art. Cool. 
CHIEF There's more. Follow me. 
BLACK TEENAGER Oh shit! 
The teen runs inside. 
The Hammer's Caddy pulls up to a stop right at camera, giving us a full view of the license plate. It reads, "LCHAIM." 
INT. KWANZAA LIBERATION FRONT HQ - MOMENTS LATER 
A handful of BAAAD BROTHERS, decked out in a mixture of African clothing and combat gear relax to the sounds of mellow Blaxploitation music. 'KWANZAA NOW!' posters and other Pro-Kwanzaa propaganda hang on the walls of the room, machine guns rest idly against sofas,  blunts are passed around. We're talking Black Panthers here. A WHITE ACCOUNTANT counts money at a card table to the side of the room. 
The black teenager enters breathlessly. 
BLACK TEENAGER Hey, yo, we got ourselves a visitor. 
O.S., one of the BAAAD BROTHERS inquires. 
BAAAD BROTHER (O.S.) Who is it? 
BLACK TEENAGER It's some pimped out Hebrew dude in a caddy. 
The men scramble for their guns, inserting clips, and removing safeties. 
The front doors bust open, and we DOLLY into the Hammer. 
All guns are trained on him. 
From behind the frontline of gunmen, MOHAMMED, clearly the leader of the operation, pushes his way through. 
He walks towards the Hammer. You can feel the tension in the room. 
MOHAMMED The Hebrew Hammer! My main Kike! 
HAMMER Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim. My main nigga! 
The two embrace in a warm hug. The White Accountant looks up in shock from the card table. His nametag is clearly visible, and it reads, "WHITE ACCOUNTANT." He points at Mohammed. 
WHITE ACCOUNTANT You...you just called him a Kike. 
He points to the Hammer. 
WHITE ACCOUNTANT (CONT'D) And you. You just called him a Nigger. 
The Hammer and Mohammed look to one another. They're having a hard time understanding his concern. 
MOHAMMED Well it's okay when we call each other that. 
The White Accountant thinks it over for a second. 
WHITE ACCOUNTANT Oh. 
The other Brothers put their guns down and go back to their pre-Hammer activities, and the accountant takes his place back at the card table. 
Mohammed puts his arm around the Hammer. 
MOHAMMED So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF? 
HAMMER I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa? 
MOHAMMED Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode. 
The Hammer looks over at the Brothers smoking weed, making out with their girlfriends, etc. Mohammed takes notice. 
MOHAMMED (CONT'D) Gotta always be cool under pressure. You know what I'm sayin. 
HAMMER True dat. True dat. So, what's the word on the street? 
MOHAMMED Word is that papa's got a brand new bag, and it's velvety red, and it ain't gonna be overnight Fed-Exed to Jerusalem. If you know what I mean. 
This clearly flies over the Hammer's yarmulke. 
SANTA (CONT'D) With the Hebrew Hammer out of the picture, Hanukkah will be nothing more than a confusing and hard to pronounce word. I want to thank you very much Jamal for all of your help. 
We cut to the other side to reveal whom he's speaking to. Jamal, the same black 'elf' from the Kwanzaa Liberation Front sits at the table across from Santa. 
JAMAL Pfff. Shit nigga, ain't no thang. Hey, yo Santy Claus, so does this mean that you gonna make me an official elf now? 
SANTA Can you believe this guy Tiny Tim? 
Santa looks over to TINY TIM. Unshaven, not so tiny anymore, and still on crutches, Tiny Tim's grown up since 'A Christmas Carol.' A common street thug. C'mon, did you seriously think that Scrooge would give free handouts to the Cratchit family forever? 
Tiny Tim shrugs his shoulders. 
SANTA (CONT'D) Take a look around you Jamal. Do you see any colored midgets in my workshop? 
A shot of a couple of the same elves from the conference room slaving away on the assembly line. 
SANTA (CONT'D) Your presence would be a disruption to the utopian model of efficiency I've created here. 
JAMAL That's some cold shit. 
The ELVES appear to be struggling with the speed at which the products move down the assembly line. The HEAD ELF steps out from the assembly line and addresses Santa. 
HEAD ELF Utopian model of efficiency my ass! Ever since you took charge, this place has been more like a sweatshop. 
The other elves stop working and vocalize their agreement with the Head Elf. 
HEAD ELF (CONT'D) We know our rights Santa! You're in violation of the union regulations! We're going on strike! 
The other elves shout out their approval. Santa takes it all in stride. 
SANTA You know something, you're right. 
The Head Elf is taken aback by what seems to be a glimpse of compassion on Santa's part. 
HEAD ELF Really? 
SANTA Yeah. This is a sweatshop. And since you elves aren't willing to do the work, I made arrangements to have some Taiwanese children shipped over. And I might add, they're more than willing to work for peanuts. 
Santa performs the two fingered whistle. 
SANTA (CONT'D) Come on in boys! 
A group of FIVE TAIWANESE BOYS file past Santa towards the assembly line. 
As each child passes Santa, he hands them each a bag of PEANUTS. 
At the assembly line, the Taiwanese boys move like lightning as they gift wrap boxes clearly labeled "NIKEY," "KATHY LEE CLOTHING COMPANY," and "STARSTRUCKS COFFEE." 
The elves, including Jamal, watch in amazement at their agility and efficiency. 
Defeated, they shuffle out of the workshop. 
TINY TIM So, what's our first plan of attack Santa? 
SANTA While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant. 
Santa walks over to a FED-Y truck overflowing with large brown cardboard boxes marked 'PRODUCT.' 
SANTA (CONT'D) I want you and your men to target every young person in the Jewish neighborhoods of every major city of this country. I want you to flood their streets with this product. 
TINY TIM What should I charge? 
SANTA Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples. 
Tiny Tim's curiosity is peaked. 
TINY TIM So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine? 
SANTA Worse. 
CHIEF We're on it Hammer. How'd you do with Santa? 
HAMMER It was a trap. I'm back at square one. 
CHIEF Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once. 
HAMMER Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen. 
CHIEF One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The... 
We cut back to the Hammer on the payphone. He holds the receiver away from his ear. He doesn't want to hear this. 
HAMMER The fate of Hanukkah. Right. Right. Yeah, Got it. Will do. Okay, bye now. 
He hangs up and leaves. 
STAR OF DAVID WIPE TO: 
INT. MALL OF AMERICA - DAY 
'Merry Christmas' decorations and signage dominate the landscape of the establishing shot of the Mall. 
Tiny Tim, walkie-talkie in hand, surveys this Christmas Wonderland with smug satisfaction. He spots a small, barely visible Hanukkah decoration poking out from beneath one of the other Christmas decorations. 
He rips it from the wall and tosses it into a small trashcan bonfire. 
Tiny Tim speaks into his the walkie-talkie. 
TINY TIM One partridge in a pear tree to two turtle doves. What's your status? 
CUT TO: 
ANOTHER PART OF THE MALL 
Two adult sized Santa's Helpers, TONY AND MIKEY stand with walkie-talkies behind the nightclub velvet ropes, and hold back the throngs (15-20 extras) of screaming children attempting to make their way past the red curtain to see Santa. A huge 'Citizen Kane'/Big Brother style poster with a menacing picture of Santa looms behind them. It reads, "SANTA CLAUS: HE KNOWS IF YOU'VE BEEN NAUGHTY OR NICE." 
Santa's staging area is very Studio 54. Both Tony and Mikey are decked out in Addidas warm up pants, gold chains, etc. Tony, very Guido in his mannerisms, replies into his walkie... 
TONY Nothing stirring here. 
A little BLONDE GENTILE GIRL tugs on Tony's sleeve. 
BLONDE GENTILE GIRL Can I be next? Please, please! 
TONY Let's get a look at you, shall we. 
The Gentile Girl pulls her Power Muff Girls T-shirt down, allowing the two to get a better look at it. 
TONY (CONT'D) A power muff girls T. Very nice. Alright, now spin around. 
She twirls for the two. 
TONY (CONT'D) Very nice! Alright. You're cool. Go on and see Santa, sunshine. 
A pushy, FRECKLE FACED GENTILE BOY steps out of line and approaches the two. 
FRECKLE FACED GENTILE BOY That's not fair! How come she gets to go next? We were here first! 
TONY Oh really! Is that a fact? Well guess what buddy? You ain't gettin' in to see Santa today, so why don't you just turn around and high tail it home. 
The kid begins to sob uncontrollably. 
FRECKLE FACED GENTILE BOY But I've been waiting to see Santa all year. 
Tony apes him. 
TONY But I've been waiting to see Santa all year. 
The kid is a pathetic mess. 
INSIDE THE CURTAIN 
JIMMY, an adorable six year old sits on Santa's lap. Santa's assistants, two busty blondes named BAMBI and TAWNI, flank his chair. 
SANTA And what do the Jewish people do during Hanukkah? 
JIMMY They worship the devil and sacrifice small Gentile children like me in bizarre, sadistic rituals. 
SANTA That's right. Santa can tell that you've been a very good boy this year. Run along now Jimmy. 
Bambi and Tawni escort Jimmy out, and re-enter with Esther and the Hammer. Santa's confused. 
SANTA (CONT'D) Sorry folks, I don't do couples. 
HAMMER If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt. 
SANTA Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am? 
The Hammer rips off his baseball hat and T-shirt. Santa gasps. 
HAMMER Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah. 
SANTA The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive. 
The Hammer takes out his gun and points it Santa. 
HAMMER What's your shpiel, Santa? 
SANTA Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering? (To Bambi and Tawni) Girls. 
Santa snaps his fingers, and Bambi and Tawni drape themselves on either side of the Hammer, rubbing his arms erotically. 
SANTA (CONT'D) Bambi. Tawni. I'd like for you to meet world renown Semitic super stud, Mordechai Jefferson Carver. 
Bambi speaks with a thick Southern drawl. 
BAMBI Oh, I declare I just love Jewish men. They're so sensitive and well read. 
Esther is clearly jealous. 
The Hammer's enjoying the attention. He looks down at Bambi's breasts. We're talking HUGE, obviously augmented boobolas. A large crucifix chain hangs around her neck, nestled in between the mounds of silicone. We hear the requisite DING as it sparkles. 
The Hammer is released from the sexual spell of the Gentile Seductress. 
HAMMER Sorry Santa. I like my women like my matzah. Unleavened. 
The girls move away from the Hammer. Esther smiles at the Hammer's resolve. 
HAMMER (CONT'D) This is where you go down. 
Suddenly, Tony draws the curtain back. 
TONY Hey, hurry it up in there. We gotta bunch of kids... 
He sees the Hammer with his gun pointed at Santa's head. 
TONY (CONT'D) Oh shit! 
Esther pulls out her piece and points it at Tony. 
ESTHER Back it up buddy! 
He does. The entire crowd of children can now see what's happening. Hushed, fearful whispers. MC Hammer steps out of line and pleads... 
MC HAMMER Please Hammer, don't hurt em'! 
The Hammer does a double take. MC Hammer gives a "Did I just say that?" expression. 
HAMMER Let's do this clean. I don't want to make a scene Santa. 
She turns around, pleasantly surprised. 
ESTHER Hey. 
HAMMER Do you want to get out of here? 
She looks relieved. 
ESTHER I would love to get out of here. 
INT. THE HAMMER'S PAD - NIGHT 
A smooth, laid back Blaxploitation era song pumps from the speakers. We do a SLOW PAN from the stereo into a TIGHT SHOT of Esther and the Hammer slow dancing. Sexy. Esther grunts and moans a bit. 
We begin a SLOW ZOOM back from the two, eventually pulling back far enough to see what Esther's moaning about. The Hammer is a seriously terrible dancer, stepping on her toes, forcing her into awkward positions, etc. 
We see a CU of the Hammer accidentally stepping on her toes yet again. 
ESTHER Ouch! 
Esther pulls herself away from the Hammer. 
HAMMER Sorry. I'm better with men. 
ESTHER (Sensually) Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing. 
HAMMER You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...Oh. I get it. 
We see a TIGHT MEDIUM SHOT of Esther. Her erect nipples are clearly outlined through her blouse. Now, the Hammer's really getting it. 
HAMMER (CONT'D) Now we're talking Boobola. 
ESTHER Mordechai? 
HAMMER Yes Esther. 
ESTHER I want you to talk dirty to me. 
HAMMER Oh. Okay. 
He thinks for a moment. 
HAMMER (CONT'D) I want to have lots of children by you. Get a good paying, stable job. Settle down in Long Island somewhere. Someplace nice. Fancy. But not fancy schmancy. 
She's warming up. 
HAMMER (CONT'D) I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar. 
ESTHER Keep going. 
HAMMER Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism. 
She's on fire for him. 
ESTHER Oh god, yes! Keep going! Don't stop! 
HAMMER Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life. 
ESTHER Kiss me you Semitic stud! 
She grabs him and kisses him passionately. 
ESTHER (CONT'D) (Playfully) Hmm. I feel something poking around down there. Maybe I should investigate. What do you think about that Mr. Certified Circumcised Dick? 
She begins to unzip his pants. We cut to a shot of an excited Mordechai as we hear the sound of the unzipping of his pants reach its conclusion. 
A CU on her as she looks down at his Jewish Manhood. A wide eyed, almost shocked reaction. She slowly looks back to him and smiles slyly. 
ESTHER (CONT'D) Shabat Shalom! 
STAR OF DAVID WIPE TO: 
INT. JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - MAIN CHAMBER - DAY 
The Star Of David vault-like doors open, and the Hammer and Esther hurriedly enter the room. The Chief waits for them. 
CHIEF Mordechai. Thank god you're here. 
HAMMER What's up? 
CHIEF About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole. 
He clicks a button on a remote control, and static fills the GIANT TELECOMMUNICATIONS SCREEN, eventually fading into the image of a larger then life SANTA. 
SANTA And now my Hanukkah loving friends, I will reveal to you the true nature of my diabolical scheme. 
An image of a GIANT CLOCK in the shape of a Star Of David. 
SANTA (V.O.) (CONT'D) The Jewish Atomic clock, located in the outskirts of Jerusalem. Keeper of time for the Jewish Calendar. Powered by Judeum. An element so rare, it exists only inside the clock itself. 
We TILT down to reveal a BLUE GLOWING SUBSTANCE in its base. 
Santa comes back on screen. 
SANTA (CONT'D) Once I extract the Judeum from the clock, the Jewish Calendar will cease to exist, forever eradicating Hanukkah. In less than twenty four hours, which by your Jewish Calendar is approximately... 
He struggles with this one. He looks at someone O.S. at the North Pole. 
SANTA (CONT'D) (To someone at North Pole) Can I borrow that pen and notepad? 
A notepad and pen are handed to him from O.S. Santa makes some written calculations on the notepad. He's clearly having trouble. 
The Hammer and Esther exchange looks. 
SANTA (CONT'D) (Uncertain) Four years and three quarters a lunar cycle? (Shifting back into psycho mode) Well, whatever! In less than twenty four Christian hours, Hanukkah will be nothing more than a fond memory. Tiny Tim. 
Tiny Tim hobbles into frame on his crutches. 
TINY TIM Merry Christmas everybody, and god bless us, everyone. 
The two laugh hysterically. 
SANTA End transmission. 
The transmission, however, doesn't end. The two abruptly stop laughing. Santa begins to talk to TINY TIM. 
SANTA (CONT'D) So, how was I? 
TINY TIM It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about. 
SANTA Really? Good, good. 
We cut to more confused reactions of the Hammer and Esther. 
SANTA (CONT'D) I wasn't too over the top? 
TINY TIM No, it was the perfect level. 
SANTA Thanks. Oh, did I tell you. I picked up that new KC and the Sunshine Band record that you recommended. You were right, it is good. 
Santa looks towards the camera and begins to react strangely. 
SANTA (CONT'D) (To O.S. Cameraman) Why is the red light on the camera still on? Are you still filming me!? 
Santa approaches the camera. 
SANTA (CONT'D) You fucking ass... 
Static fills the screen. 
We cut to a sign reading "THE WEST BANK PALMS: A GATED COMMUNITY. COMING SOON!" On it, we see an illustration of a housing compound surrounded by a remarkable amount of BARBED WIRE. 
We PAN over to the highway as the Hammer zips past on his motorcycle. 
INT. ESTHER'S CADILLAC - CONTINUOUS 
The Hammer, unaware of her presence, speeds by her large Cadillac. She puts the car into gear. 
EXT. ISRAELI OPEN  HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Tucked out of sight behind a billboard, Esther pulls off from her side of the road and onto the highway in pursuit of the Hammer. And yes, the car is lowered, with white walled tires. 
The camera makes it way up to reveal a large ROADSIDE BILLBOARD ARROW, resembling the ones you might see advertising casinos on the drive into Vegas announces "THE JEWISH ATOMIC CLOCK. 20 Kilometers." 
CUT TO: 
EXT. JEWISH ATOMIC CLOCK - AFTERNOON 
From the outside the J.A.C has the appearance of an observatory. For no apparent reason, a small MOTORCYCLE RAMP sits near the front door. 
A single Fed-Y truck pulls into the dirt parking lot. 
A gang of THUG ELVES spill out of the back of the truck as a S.W.A.T. team would. 
HEAD ELF Go, go, go! 
The Head Elf jumps out, and out of frame. 
CUT TO: 
An ELF FLUNKY stand by a SMALL MOTORCYCLE RAMP, studying it curiously. The Head Elf walks into frame. 
HEAD ELF (CONT'D) What's this doing here? 
ELF FLUNKY Not sure. I think it was left over from an Israeli Robbie Kneivel television special. You want me to get rid of it? 
HEAD ELF No time. Besides, it's not like someone's gonna jump their motorcycle into the building while we're inside. 
The HEAD THUG ELF points up towards the sky. 
HEAD ELF (CONT'D) There's Santa now. 
The Thug Elves look up to the sky, and we do an OVERHEAD PUSH DOWN ON THEM as helicopter force winds blow their hats off. 
The carriage of SANTA'S SLEIGH touches down on the ground. 
Tiny Tim sits shotgun in the sleigh while Santa vomits violently over the other side. Santa finishes up, and wipes his mouth with his hand. 
TINY TIM You okay? 
SANTA No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly? 
TINY TIM I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir. 
Santa takes this in. 
CUT TO: 
Santa paces as a Drill Sargent would in front of the line of harnessed reindeer. They're shivering in their hooves. 
SANTA Who's the leader of this operation? 
More scared reindeer faces. Comet furtively motions towards Rudolph with his antlers. Santa sees this, marches quickly up to Rudolph, and gets in his face. 
SANTA (CONT'D) What's your major malfunction, dumbfuck!? 
Rudolph's scared shitless. 
SANTA (CONT'D) Step forward son! 
SANTA Get him boys! 
Santa's Elf Thugs open a CHEST filled with LARGE SUB-MACHINE GUNS. The chest is labeled "HEAVY ARTILLERY." With great difficulty, they struggle to pull the heavy machinery out of the box. 
The Hammer, mildly amused, watches them. 
The Hammer blasts away, and the elves scramble for safety. The sound of gunfire is deafening and constant. 
An Elf sneaks quietly towards Santa's gun. 
Esther walks in through the front door and spots something O.S. that gives her cause for concern. 
Unbeknownst to the Hammer, the SNEAKY ELF picks up Santa's gun.  He raises it at the Hammer, ready to fire. 
ESTHER Mordechai! Behind you! 
The Hammer turns and nails the elf just in time. 
Esther, gun drawn, backs up into frame with the Hammer, and the two fire off rounds. 
HAMMER What are you doing here? 
ESTHER Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone. 
HAMMER I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong. 
ESTHER I forgive you. 
HAMMER Go check on the clock. I'll finish up here. 
We do another QUICK PUSH into the Hammer as he turns towards Tiny Tim. 
Tiny Tim, standing alone with his crutches tucked under his arms, looks like a deer caught in headlights. 
The Hammer grins mischievously. 
TINY TIM Uh oh. 
The Hammer begins firing. 
In SLOW-MOTION, Tiny Tim hobbles as fast as he can towards an overturned table, gunfire trailing him. Like a pole vaulter with two poles, Tiny Tim plants his crutches firmly into the ground and launches himself over the table. 
He lands directly on top of Santa, who cowers underneath the table. 
SANTA Get off of me you cripple! 
TINY TIM What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes. 
We DOLLY BACK with the Hammer as he approaches the camera, firing rounds at the table. 
We cut to the duct taped Hasidic Guards tied to their chairs. One of them frantically nudges the other and motions to the window. Fear fills both of their eyes. 
We see what they see. Through the window, the SUN is quickly setting behind the mountains. 
We cut back to the Hammer. The speed with which he shoots begins to slow. 
Esther, checking the clock for damage calls to him. 
ESTHER What's the matter? 
HAMMER I don't know. I'm feeling kind of tired. 
We cut back to Santa and Tiny Tim underneath the table. We HEAR the shooting continue to slow, until finally it ceases altogether. Santa and Tiny Tim exchange looks. 
SANTA What's going on? Why'd he stop? 
TINY TIM Maybe he ran out of ammo. 
SANTA Take a look. 
JAMAL Merry Kwanzaa nigga! 
STAR OF DAVID WIPE TO: 
INT. JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - MAIN CHAMBER - SATURDAY NIGHT 
The Hammer and Mohammed enter through the vault doors. The Chief waits anxiously. 
CHIEF Mordechai, you're back. The clock? 
HAMMER Still ticking. Thanks to the help from the Brothers at the KLF, Hanukkah's safe for now. 
CHIEF That's wonderful! 
The Chief notices the Hammer's dejected look. 
CHIEF (CONT'D) So why the long face? 
HAMMER It's Esther. Santa's got her. 
CHIEF My Esther! Oh Mordechai. 
The Chief, overcome by sadness, slumps down into a chair. 
CHIEF (CONT'D) Please. Will you help me? 
HAMMER I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission. 
Mo, standing in the BG, gives the Chief the fist/chest salute. 
MOHAMMED Asalam Alekem. 
CHIEF (To Mo) You're a mench. Thank you. (To Hammer) Mordechai, by any means necessary, you bring my Esther back to me. Even if it requires using Judaism's most powerful weapon. 
HAMMER Oh no, not the... 
The Chief shakes his head yes. 
HAMMER (CONT'D) There won't be any need for that sir. 
CHIEF Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands. 
HAMMER I know sir. I won't let you down. 
The Hammer motions to Mo, and the two begin to leave. They pass by Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. The Hammer acknowledges him. 
HAMMER (CONT'D) Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. 
SAMMY DAVIS JR. JR. You two cats are beautiful. I love you guys. You take care babe. 
Mo whispers into the Hammer's ear. 
MOHAMMED What's wrong with him? 
HAMMER He's still working out some identity issues. 
STAR OF DAVID WIPE TO: 
EXT. NORTH POLE - DAY 
The Hammer and Mo crawl onto the snow covered bluff overlooking Santa's Workshop. With his binoculars, the Hammer scopes out the compound below. 
BINOCULAR POV - Instead of your standard two circles filling the screen, we see the world through a pair of Star Of Davids. The place resembles the exterior of an industrial warehouse, with two Elves on guard with guns. 
HAMMER It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet. 
MOHAMMED I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years. 
The Hammer puts the binoculars down. 
Suddenly, the two women are pushed from his lap as a SASSY BLACK PROSTITUTE rises up between his legs from underneath the table. 
SASSY BLACK PROSTITUTE Listen motherfucker, I already told you! I don't care how much yo ass is payin' me, if you call me that one more time there ain't gonna be no more visits down to the South Pole! You feelin' me!? 
His ego deflates a bit. 
SANTA Yes maam, loud and clear. 
Tiny Tim enters the room. He has a black eye and his clothing is torn. 
SASSY BLACK PROSTITUTE Damn sugar, what happened to you? 
TINY TIM Santa, I got some really bad news. 
EXT. COMPOUND PERIMETER WALL - DAY 
The Hammer wears Tefilon, consisting of leather straps with boxes, wrapped around his head and arms. He silently bows his head in front of the gigantic wall as he mumbles something to himself. Mo nervously scans the area for guards. 
MOHAMMED What are you doing? 
HAMMER Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall. 
The Hammer unwraps his leather straps, and then tosses them high over the wall. 
The boxes on the straps catch on a pipe. The line is pulled taut, and the boxes hold secure against the pipe. 
The Hammer and Mo begin to scale the wall a la the 60's Batman and Robin television show. The Hammer leads the way while Mo, directly behind him, has his arms wrapped tightly around his waist. The Hammer stops climbing for a second, and turns to him. 
HAMMER (CONT'D) You know, you don't have to hold on to my waist. You're tied in. 
Mo releases his arms from the Hammer's waist. Indeed, he is tied in. 
MOHAMMED I knew that. 
EXT. SANTA'S COMPOUND PERIMETER WALL - OTHER SIDE - MOMENTS LATER 
The Hammer and Mo drop from the wall onto the ground. The Hammer looks around. 
No guards in sight. In front of them is door clearly marked "BACK DOOR." 
MOHAMMED Well, that was easy. 
Mo heads for the door. The Hammer calls to him. 
HAMMER Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system. 
MOHAMMED A stereo type alarm system? 
HAMMER Take a look. 
The Hammer points to above the door. Sure enough, there sit TWO LARGE STEREO SPEAKERS. 
MOHAMMED How do we bypass it? 
HAMMER The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound. 
This pisses Mo off. 
MOHAMMED Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player. 
HAMMER Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon. 
The two enter through the door. 
INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS 
The Hammer shuts the door behind them. So far, so good. 
Suddenly, the two hear the sound of footsteps coming down the hall. They duck into a corner. 
HAMMER That's...that's a very good question. And I do know that it does have something to do with...dreidels, and... 
Esther chimes in. 
ESTHER ...and latkes. 
HAMMER And latkes! And some miracle oil that lasted eight days. And that my friend, should've been enough for you. Take him away Mo. 
Mo drags Santa out of the room. 
SANTA I'm sorry. I see the light now. I was wrong. I'm... 
And Santa's gone. 
The Hammer turns to Esther, and gets down on one knee. He places a ring on her finger. 
HAMMER Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal, will you marry me? 
She glows. 
ESTHER Yes! Of course! I'd gladly give up my last name to be with you. 
The two kiss in celebration. 
Joe pokes his head out into the Hallway. 
JOE LIEBERMAN What happened out there? 
He looks to the Hammer. The Hammer shrugs his shoulders. 
JOE LIEBERMAN (CONT'D) Oh Mordechai, you know how I detest gore. 
HAMMER Well then maybe you should have thought about that before you ran with him. C'mon, let's get you back to Washington. 
And we PULL out as the three make their way down the hallway. 
TITLE CARD: ONE WEEK LATER. CHRISTMAS EVE. 
INT. MRS. CARVER'S HOUSE - SHABAT 
Mrs. Carver exits the kitchen, platters of food in hand. 
MRS. CARVER Shabat Shalom everybody! 
We see Esther and the Hammer at the other end of the table. They smile and hold hands. Domestic bliss. 
HAMMER/ESTHER Shabat Shalom! 
With a bit of difficulty, Mrs. Carver works her large behind into her chair. 
HAMMER And a Merry Christmas to all of our Gentile friends. Mun Chi. 
The Hammer raises his glass in honor of Mun Chi. Mun Chi returns the gesture. 
HAMMER (CONT'D) Before we start the Sabbath, I'd personally just like to thank god for all the blessings I've received over the past year. A beautiful fiancee... 
Esther smiles. 
HAMMER (CONT'D) ...a wonderful mother... 
Mrs. Carver is as proud as can be... 
HAMMER (CONT'D) ...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community. 
MRS. CARVER Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos. 
She squeezes his hand. 
HAMMER Thanks mom.

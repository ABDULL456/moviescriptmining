1 EXT. GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 1 
From high above we see the castle gardens covered in a blanket of snow. We hear the tread of footsteps then see a beautiful WOMAN in a fur-lined cloak heading towards an unseen object. 
ERIC (V.0.) Once upon a time, in deep winter, a Queen was admiring the falling snow when she saw a rose blooming in defiance of the cold. The rose looks miraculously red. Nearby, a RAVEN looks on. The Queen gazes at the flower, then bends down. 
ERIC (V.0.) Reaching for it, she pricked her finger and three drops of blood fell. BOOM -- with the impact of an artillery shell, a DROP OF BLOOD lands in the snow. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. The Queen startles, then calmly touches her stomach. 
ERIC (V.0.) And because the red seemed so alive against the white, she thought, if only I had a child as white as snow, lips as red as blood, hair as black as a raven's wings and all with the strength of that rose. A beat, then we hear the piercing cry of a new-born baby -- 
2 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY. 2 
We find ourselves in a crowded chamber full of MIDWIVES and PHYSICIANS. Moving through the chaos we glimpse buckets of water, dirty sponges, astrology charts and protection charms -- until we see a BABY GIRL in the arms of her happy mother. 
ERIC (V.O.) Soon after, a daughter was born to the Queen and was named "Snow White." With a radiant smile, the Queen offers SNOW WHITE to her proud father, KING MAGNUS. The baby's CRIES grow louder as the King cradles her gently in his arms, turning towards a mirror. 
ERIC V/O And she was adored throughout the kingdom as much for her defiant spirit as for her beauty. 
3 EXT. WOODS NEAR CASTLE - DAY. 3 
A wounded MAGPIE is twitching in a puddle of water. SNOW WHITE, aged 7 now, steps towards it hesitantly, looking concerned. 
(CONTINUED) 
3 CONTINUED: 3 
YOUNG SNOW WHITE Pick it up, William. Her companion, William, also 7, braces himself, reaches down, then steps back in alarm as the bird starts flapping wildly. He tries to cover his embarrassment by sounding knowledgeable. 
YOUNG WILLIAM It's dying. It doesn't want to be touched. Snow White ignores him, approaching the bird herself. She kneels down, hesitates, then reaches out and strokes the magpie, calming its flapping before she picks it up. High up on a tree, ANOTHER MAGPIE looks on. 
4 EXT. SEASIDE VILLAGE/ CASTLE BRIDGE - DAY 4 
SNOW WHITE runs, cupping the wounded bird in her hand, William dashing after her. The sun is out and the fields and forests are lit up in all their glory. The children sprint through a BEAUTIFUL SEASIDE VILLAGE -- thatched homes with flower gardens, HAPPY FARMERS and FAIR VILLAGE MAIDENS -- 
YOUNG SNOW WHITE Hurry, William! Hurry! They run down the dunes, waves crashing, the sand gleaming in the sunlight, until they see the BEAUTIFUL CASTLE up ahead -- 
5 EXT. CLOISTER GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY 5 
A single apple tree stands in the middle of the cloisters. It stands out. Snow White and William dash past it into the castle.

7 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY. 7 
Snow White bursts into her parent's chamber. The King and Queen turn from the window. Two PHYSICIANS are in attendance. Snow White is too young and preoccupied to notice but her mother's smile is tinged with sadness and her father looks heartbroken. 
YOUNG SNOW WHITE We found it in the woods. The Queen takes the wounded magpie from Snow White. The King looks on sadly as she pulls a RIBBON from Snow White's hair and carefully binds the magpie's wing. William watches from the doorway, noticing how frail the Queen looks. The magpie's flapping gradually calms, its pain easing. 
QUEEN It will heal in time. Snow White's eyes are fixed on the little bird. 
(CONTINUED) 
7 CONTINUED: 7 
SNOW WHITE You did? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RAVENNA Yes. A King tore me from her arms, dressed me in lace and stole my innocence. Snow White's smile dies a bit; confused. 
RAVENNA I can never take your mother's place, but I feel that you and I are bound. (touches her heart) I feel it here. Snow White mimics, touching her own heart, and smiles at Ravenna. It should be a touching moment but something in Snow White's face - the way her smile lights up the room - gives Ravenna pause. 
12 INT. CATHEDRAL - DAY 12 
Ravenna, in a stunning dress,.walks down the center aisle. All the NOBLES in the land are present. Ravenna looks at them, on either side of the aisle. They are all smiling, nodding appreciation. But they aren't really looking at Ravenna. She follows their gaze to -- Snow White, behind, holding the folds of silk from the wedding dress. Snow White looks up, adoringly, at Ravenna. As the bride and groom reach the altar, KING MAGNUS turns and smiles, the happiest man alive. 
13 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - NIGHT 13 
King Magnus lies on the bed, drunk - half with wine and half with lust. His eyes fixed on -- Ravenna, in a sheer silk nightgown standing near the fireplace, holding a goblet. Staring a seductive hole through him. She starts slowly toward him, never taking her eyes off him. He licks his lips - can't wait for her to arrive. 
KING MAGNUS (Gazing at her lustfully) Who are you? 
RAVENNA The bane of Kings. When she does arrive she slowly crawls onto the bed, rolls him on his back, straddles him and offers the goblet. 
RAVENNA Sup, my lord. King Magnus drains the goblet, tosses it and gropes her body. 
(CONTINUED) 
13 CONTINUED: 13 
RAVENNA Now you are mine. Her eyes gleam in the firelight. Magnus tries to playfully wrestle her off, but she grabs his hands and holds him down firmly. 
RAVENNA I will destroy you. 
KING MAGNUS 
(LOVING IT) Indeed, you will. She rips open his shirt then bends down and kisses him on the lips. He can't believe how good she tastes. 
RAVENNA As my people were destroyed. As my family was destroyed. As I would have been destroyed. He is slightly confused by this and his face begins to show discomfort. 
RAVENNA But when a woman stays young forever - no man can resist her - and the world is hers. He suddenly STARTS TO CHOKE, his eyes widening in surprise. As he struggles for breath... 
KING MAGNUS What...? 
RAVENNA First I will take your life, my lord. Then I will take your throne. She reaches beneath the sheets, pulls out an ORNATE DAGGER and BRINGS IT DOWN THROUGH HIM -- 13a EXT. OUTSIDE ROYAL BEDROOM 13a Several Guards line the hallway. The door opens and Ravenna emerges. As she moves past them... 
RAVENNA The King has laid down his sword for the night. Their eyes take her, lustfully, in as she strides away and disappears around a corner. 
CUT TO: 
13b INT. GYPSY WAGON - FLASHBACK - DAY. 13b Ravenna's mother takes Ravenna's hand and holds it over a bowl of white liquid. 
RAVENNA'S MOTHER You must trust me, my love. With a small blade she nicks Ravenna's wrist. Three drops of blood fall into the white liquid - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Finn, Ravenna's brother blasts through the door. 
FINN They're coming! The King's men! 
RAVENNA Drink! Ravenna chokes it down. 
RAVENNA'S MOTHER Drink! And with it the ability to steal youth and beauty! For that is your ultimate power and only protection. Finn steps forward. 
FINN I will protect my sister! Ravenna's mother reaches out and touches her son's forehead, closes her eyes, an incantation of sorts... 
FINN So it shall be, Finn. 
CUT TO: 
14 EXT. COURTYARD/CASTLE - PRESENT - NIGHT 14 
Ravenna exits the castle and crosses the courtyard with a lantern. A portcullis opens and DARK FIGURES emerge from the shadows, entering the castle. Leading them is a tall pale-eyed warrior (FINN). He looks at Ravenna devotedly. 
RAVENNA Welcome, brother. 
A chill wind whips through the woods. Lying sprawled on the ground we see a man (ERIC) who looks like he's dead. 
(CONTINUED) 
22 CONTINUED: 22 It's only as we move closer to his rugged face that we see the empty FLAGON OF GROG by his side and realize he's drunk. His eyes flicker, as a WOMAN'S SCREAM cuts through the woods. 
FLASH TO: 
THE SPECTRE OF A WOMAN SARA, beautiful, in pain. A patch of blood blossoms on her dress. Her mouth is open, screaming but no sound comes out. 
BACK TO SCENE - WE HEAR THE SCREAM Eric's eyes flicker and begin to open -- then he hears it again. 
ROSE (O.S.) Help!!!! He rises to his feet unsteadily, his head pounding from a hangover, then grabs two THROWING HATCHETS and slides them into his harness on his back -- 
23-240MITTED 23-24 
25 EXT. FOREST - DAY. 25 
Eric runs past trees and ducks under branches, crashing into a few, still drunk. As he arrives at a clearing he sees a beautiful girl, (ROSE), fighting off a HUGE TATTOOED WARRIOR, 
(BROCH). 
ERIC Lay a hand on her and I'll take your head! BROCH turns and sees the huntsman with his hatchet raised. 
BROCH Ale given you courage again, huntsman? 
ERIC Won't take much courage to split your skull from here. 
BROCH Aye, but first you'd have to see straight. Broch advances with a grin, drawing his own axe. Trying to clear his vision and steady his aim, Eric hurls the hatchet -- and MISSES, the blade sticking in the tree above the frightened Greta's head -- Broch is on Eric in an instant, swinging his huge battle axe. Eric narrowly avoids the deadly blows, his natural skill and dexterity slowed down by all the ale he's drunk. 
(CONTINUED) 
13A 
25 CONTINUED: 25 Rose looks on, terrified, as Broch drives Eric towards the trees. He corners him against an oak and swings his axe -- only for Eric to duck at the last moment -- The blade buries itself deep in the tree, stuck. We realize now from Eric's dark smile that he lured Broch into the trap. He draws his second hatchet, but instead of using the blade, cracks Broch over the head with the handle, knocking him out. Rose looks on in admiration as the huntsman goes through Broch's pockets. 
(CONTINUED) 
25 CONTINUED: (2) 25 
ROSE Thank you. Eric turns. Rose sees how handsome he is. Eric stares at her thoughtfully then approaches and gently lifts her chin, examining her pretty features. Rose doesn't seem to mind, looking back with an inviting smile. 
ROSE I don't know how to repay you? Eric stares at her a moment, then suddenly picks her up and tosses her over his shoulders. 
ERIC Don't worry, somebody else will. 
26 OMITTED 26 
27 EXT. VILLAGE - DAY. 27 
And now we see a RICKETY PRISON WAGON full of BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, just like Rose, staring out furiously from behind bars. Eric and a SLAVE MERCHANT haggle over Rose who is bound and gagged, looking just as furious as the other women. 
SLAVE MERCHANT Her nose is on the large size and her chin's a little weak. 
ERIC Your eyes are dim. 
SLAVE MERCHANT I'll give you two gold pieces. 
ERIC After all the business we've done together? Rose curses behind her gag as Eric pulls her away. 
SLAVE MERCHANT Four gold pieces and that's my final offer! Eric doesn't even bother to turn around. 
ERIC I'll peddle my wares elsewhere, thank you. The slave merchant sees his prize disappearing and calls out: 
SLAVE MERCHANT Ten gold pieces! Eric hesitates, but it's not from a guilty conscience, he's just considering the price. Then he smiles, turns. They have a deal. 
14A 
28 INT. PRISON TOWER/ SNOW WHITE'S CELL - DAY. 28 
ROSE I don't know, princess. Rose shakes her head, still gazing at Snow White, then hears the distant cries of other female prisoners. 
ROSE What will they do to me? 
33 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 33 
Ravenna sweeps into the great hall. The Generals and Finn snap to attention. She stops and stares at TWO MEN, the captured insurgents. THOMAS, a grizzled old rebel, looks badly bruised and beaten, while his handsome son, LAIN, is unmarked. They both stare at her defiantly. Ravenna faces the two rebels. A SOLDIER steps forward. 
SOLDIER My Queen, these two were captured leading an ambush of our supply caravan. Ravenna seems intrigued, steps forward, eyeing them. 
RAVENNA You left your home, your family, the bosom of my protection, to aid my enemies? Why? 
THOMAS Because under your rule we have lost everything. We will not stop until this kingdom is free. 
RAVENNA Lost everything? 
(REGARDS IAIN) Your son? She moves to Iain, right up to his face. 
RAVENNA Very handsome. 
(TO THOMAS) Obviously a debt owed to your wife. She reaches out and touches Iain's strong jaw. He struggles against the Guards that hold him back. 
RAVENNA There was a time I would have lost my heart to a face like yours -- and you would have no doubt broken mine. In a flash Iain grabs a Guard's dagger and rams it into Ravenna's chest. She makes a pained face, looks down at the dagger, then up to Iain. 
RAVENNA You would kill your Queen? She pulls the dagger out - there is no"wound, no blood - and drops it on the ground. Iain and Thomas are shocked. 
(CONTINUED) 
33 CONTINUED: 33 
RAVENNA (admiring; to Iain) You have beauty. And courage. But how strong is your heart? She smiles, almost regrettably, then places her hand on his chest. We hear HIS HEART START TO HAMMER -- LOUDER AND LOUDER. He grimaces in pain as she SQUEEZES -- the hammering filling his ears -- until his heart finally bursts and he drops dead. Thomas falls to his knees in horror, trying to revive his son. Finn draws his sword to behead him when Ravenna raises her hand. 
RAVENNA No. Let him return to the Duke and speak of the generosity of his Queen. With that she sweeps out, followed by Finn. It's only now that we see the lines on her face. Finn takes her by the arm as she falters. 
FINN Are you alright? Ravenna pulls her arm away furiously. The General and the others stare, alarmed. 
RAVENNA 
(TO ALL) 
OUT!!!!! They quickly exit, all save Finn, who watches, concerned, as Ravenna leans against the wall for support. She pulls herself together, looks at Finn. 
FINN Magic comes at a lofty price. 
RAVENNA And the expense grows. 
FINN You look... 
RAVENNA old?... 
FINN Tired. 
RAVENNA My powers... fade. This is about as much as Ravenna can confess. Finn watches as she walks up the stairs to the mirror chamber. Then he turns and CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE. A GUARD appears and Finn nods. 
33a INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - ROYAL PALACE 33a Ravenna walks into the room. Eyes the mirror, afraid to look at herself. 
FINN (O.S.) I have something for what ails you. She turns to see -- Finn, with Rose. Ravenna almost smiles. Rose holds her gaze defiantly. Ravenna walks over, admires her face, smiles, then takes her by the throat and -- LIFTS HER OFF HER FEET. Rose opens her mouth to scream but instead of sound, ENERGY pours out. Ravenna opens her mouth, DEVOURING GRETA'S YOUTH AND BEAUTY. Like a flower blooming, her lines vanish. Like a flower wilting, Rose AGES until she's as old as the scullery maids. 
34 INT. PRISON TOWER/ SNOW WHITE'S CELL 34 
Snow White hears approaching footsteps and watches as a Guard opens Greta's cell and tosses someone in. 
SNOW WHITE Rose?... The Guard clangs the cell door shut and walks away. Snow White peers through the shadows. Can't quite make her out. 
SNOW WHITE Rose?... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
35 INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - DAY. 35 
FINN Your beating heart. Snow White grips the roofing nail even tighter as she looks at him. As he leans closer, she notices his off hand - the dagger and -- She SLASHES him across the face with the nail. Blood flies. Finn reacts, grabs his face in pain, yells and Snow White kicks him and runs for the door, locking it behind -- 
39 INT. GRETA'S CELL/ TOWER STEPS - DAY. 39 
Snow White hurtles down the steps to Greta's cell. She is shocked by what she sees. Rose, now an old woman, looks to her. Snow White fumbles with the keys. Rose holds out both her hands. Snow White takes them, looks into her eyes. 
ROSE Go. Finn stumbles to the cell door, clutching his face. 
FINN 
GUARDS! Snow White tosses the keys into an empty cell and races away. 
40 INT. CORRIDOR/ CASTLE - DAY. 40 
Snow White runs down the steps into a corridor and sees ARMED GUARDS appear at the other end. She hurries into another tower, bolting the door shut behind her, and charges down the steps. 
41 EXT. COURTYARD/ CASTLE - DAY. 41 
SNOW WHITE BURSTS OUTSIDE -- into the light. She almost hyperventilates at all the air, the sky. Then she runs through the courtyard toward the portcullis. The magpies fly right into her face then away, telling her to follow. She does and heads straight for the small opening at the base of the castle wall - the entrance to the SEWERS. As the magpies rise, she slides on one hip, plunging into the darkness below. The guards follow but can't squeeze through the opening, running towards the Portcullis instead. 
42 INT. SEWER - DAY. 42 
Snow White splashes through the deep stinking sludge. 
43 EXT. PORTCULLIS - DAY. 43 
The old rebel, Thomas, with his son's body draped over a mule, looks back curiously as he hears the guards yelling -- 
CHIEF GUARD 0/S Open the gates! The Princess has escaped! He stares in surprise as riders gallop out. 
44 EXT. SEA - OUTSIDE CASTLE - DAY. 44 
Snow White is swept out of the sewers into the sea. Seaweed wraps itself around her limbs, pulling her deeper.into the depths, but she kicks and fights her way back to the surface -- gasping for air. 
45 EXT. BEACH -- OUTSIDE CASTLE - DAY. 45 
Snow White swims ashore. She looks up and sees a maze of large rocks stretching out. She sets off in one direction when the two MAGPIES reappear, urging her to follow them in another direction. She scrambles after them and sees a WHITE MARE waiting for her on the beach, lying on its side, allowing her to climb on. The mare raises itself and is away in a flash. 
46 EXT. BEACH - DAY. 46 
Galloping hooves skim the surf, RIDERS pursuing Snow White. 
47 EXT. DECIMATED VILLAGE - DAY. 47 
Snow White rides towards the village -- only it's unrecognizable now -- most of the cottages have been razed to the ground or boarded up. A group of people including children - skeletal, hungry, desperate - see her approach and move out to greet her. She stops her horse for a moment, gazing past tears at the devastation and the state of villagers all around her. At first their approach seems harmless but as they get closer their faces reveal dangerous desperation and -- She gallops off, looking back to see the Queen's men giving chase. 
48 EXT. FIELDS AND WOODLAND BEYOND THE VILLAGE - DAY. 48 
The fields and woods are even more devastated than the village. Farmland has been burnt to cinders and trees chopped down. All around Snow White the world is stubble and ash. 
49 EXT. ENDLESS MOOR - AERIAL SHOT - DAY. 49 
Snow White crests a hill, her mare rearing as she sees -- THE DARK FOREST -- A VAST WALL OF PRIMORDIAL TREES. A mist seeps from the forest like an evil miasma. Snow white hesitates -- then sees the riders closing in and urges her mare on -- 
50 EXT. MISTY BOGS/ ENTRANCE TO THE DARK FOREST - DAY. 50 
Shadows everywhere. The mare charges into the misty bog then suddenly loses her footing. She rears -- throwing Snow White onto the safety of solid ground. Snow White tries to grab her reins but the horse pulls away, not wanting to endanger her life. She tries again but the horse backs farther away from her. Slowly they're separated by the swirling fog -- As Snow White sees the silhouettes of the riders reappear. Reluctantly she turns and runs into the forest -- 
(CONTINUED) 
50 CONTINUED: 50 The riders are about to follow when their horses rear and kick in terror. One guard is thrown off and sucked down in the bog, frightening off the others. Despite their concern for Snow White, the MAGPIES are also too afraid to enter the forest. 
51 EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 51 
Snow White hurtles through the trees, a ghostly fog rising up all around her, then trips over a root, landing face first in -- A patch of LARGE MUSHROOMS that unleash CLOUDS OF POLLEN. She coughs, trying to fan the pollen away, but it's too late. She hurries on, but the hallucinations come thick and fast now -- The trees look almost human, hooded figures peering at her through the haze. She sees owls without eyes. Black oil oozing out of tree trunks. A hanging vine reaches down and touches her like a hand and now she runs -- More terrors rage at her from the swirling mist. She stumbles again and when she looks up vampire bats scream at her from the trees. Huge skeletal forms crack out of the bark, descending on her until she finally passes out. 
52 EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF DARK FOREST -- DAY.(D4N) 52 
From high above, we see the unconscious Snow White as mist whirls in a circle. 52a EXT. CASTLE BEACH - NIGHT.(D4N) 52a Vicious waves crash into rocks. Nature's anger on display. 
BROCH You owe me money from my pocket and money for the girl! 
ERIC I have it right here in my pocket. If you'll just help me up. Eric holds his hand out. Broch walks over, suspicious. When he's close, Eric grabs his arm and kicks with both feet in Broch's chest. Broch flies back, then strides to Eric and kicks him in the side. Hurts. 
BROCH I want my money! 
ERIC Actually, I seem to have drunk it all. You're welcome to it when it comes out again. Broch hauls him back up to his feet. He takes a swing but somehow the drunken Eric dodges the blow, swinging back at him. Everyone has come out of the Inn to enjoy the fight. Eric lands a body blow to Broch, who doubles over. Eric comes in for the kill, winds up and swings - Missing Broch but hitting a HORSE on the ass. It kicks its legs, sending him flying. He lands in a heap and drops his head back. Hands lift him and -- Drop him in a horse trough. He's underwater for a few seconds before he comes to and lifts out his head, eyes still closed. 
ERIC 
(MUMBLING DRUNKENLY) Perfume? He opens his eyes to see Finn gazing down at him. 
ERIC Royalty. That explains it. 
FINN The Queen demands your presence. 
ERIC Can't you see I'm having a bath?

58 INT. THRONE ROOM - CASTLE - DAY. 58 
RAVENS perch on the ledges and LURCHERS scamper about. Eric, still drunk, filthy, damp clothes, face bruised, enters the room, eyes the ravens, then looks at -- Ravenna on her throne. She watches him curiously. He's more interested in the aged scullery maids, including Rose, who are staring at him accusingly. He has no idea who they are or what he's done wrong. Finally he comes before the Queen, sizing her up like a tavern beauty. 
(CONTINUED) 
58 CONTINUED: 58 
RAVENNA My brother tells me you are a widower, a drunkard and one of few who has ventured into the dark forest. Finn looks on, standing nearby. 
RAVENNA One of my prisoners has escaped there. 
ERIC Then he's dead - 
RAVENNA She. She shoots Finn a pointed look then looks back at Eric. 
ERIC Then she is certainly dead. 
RAVENNA Find her. Bring her to me. Eric holds her gaze, uneasy at the request. 
ERIC I've been to the Dark Forest enough times to know I'm not going back. 
RAVENNA You will be rewarded handsomely. 
ERIC Coin's no good to me if I'm lying dead with crows picking at my eyes. Ravenna steps off her throne now, approaching him. 
RAVENNA There may be more than gold in the offing. 
ERIC Why is her life of such value? 
RAVENNA That is none of your concern. 
ERIC I'll determine what concerns me, thank you. She smiles, moves even closer to him. 
RAVENNA You will do this for me, Huntsman. 
(CONTINUED) 
28A 
58 CONTINUED: (2) 58 
ERIC And if I refuse? Ravenna nods to the Guards, who pull their swords. Dying to cut him to pieces. Eric eyes them, then looks to her and, in complete honesty -- 
(CONTINUED) 
ERIC Well,it's a long way, through the forest, and that... that's a dangerous road, I couldn't even consider it for less than thirty gold pieces... 
SNOW WHITE A hundred. Deliver me safe to the Duke. I give you my word. 
(CONTINUED) 
36B 67b CONTINUED: (3) 67b Deep quandary. Still suspicious.. 
ERIC Who are you? She looks at him levelly. 
SNOW WHITE Maybe that's a question you should have asked the queen. Stand-off. 
SNOW WHITE Do we have a deal? 
ERIC I don't trust you Billy Goat. 
SNOW WHITE I've given you my word. He spits on his hand. She puts out her hand. He shakes it. 
ERIC I still don't trust you. 
SNOW WHITE I don't trust you either. She wipes it on her skirt. Behind them, a commotion. They run off.

68 OMITTED 68 68a EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 68a Tree roots gleam with an eerie phosphorescent light. The mist closes in. Snow White looks around the forest, unnerved by the haunting silence and the deep shadows. Reluctantly she focuses on Eric, trying to take her mind off the terrors around her. He sits on a log for a breath. 
ERIC We'll stay the night here. 
SNOW WHITE You haven't answered me. 
ERIC I don't recall a question. 
SNOW WHITE Where are we going? He takes a stick, draws in the dirt. 
ERIC Queen. Mountains. Dark Forest. Here. Past. There's a village. She takes the stick, points to a different spot in the dirt. 
SNOW WHITE I'm going to the Duke's Castle. He grabs the stick back. 
ERIC You'll go where I take you. 
SNOW WHITE You'll take me to the Duke's castle or I'll go alone.

37A 68a CONTINUED: 68a SNOW WHITE (cont'd) (beat; looks around) As soon as you get me out of the forest. 
ERIC You're rather demanding, and not all that endearing, you know? 
(CONTINUED) 
68a CONTINUED: (2) 68a 
SNOW WHITE There's a reward that awaits you. There are noblemen there, an army. 
ERIC 
(LAUGHS) An army? The Duke fights? He hides behind walls. I know sheep that have more fight in them. (after a beat) How much? (off her look) Reward? Just for argument's sake? 
SNOW WHITE How much do you want? Eric considers this, not sure how or if to negotiate. 
SNOW WHITE Two hundred gold pieces. Do we have a deal? More, a lot more, than he was expecting. 
ERIC I'll deliver you to safety m' lady. 
SNOW WHITE Swear it. 
DUKE HAMMOND And I cannot afford to lose my only heir! You do not know the dark forest! 
WILLIAM Then I'll find someone who does. William pulls away. 
WILLIAM I will not abandon her a second time.

78 EXT. STABLES/ INN/ VILLAGE - DAY 78 
A motley crew of woodsmen stand side to side. Finn is eyeing them, sizing them up, picking a crew. 
FINN Which of you knows the dark forest? A powerfully built Yakut tracker, ALDAN, and BROCH both nod. 
FINN You. You. You. You. He's selected Aldan, Broch and points to others. As we move down the line we see -- William, hat low, trying to look tough. Finn selects a few more. 
FINN Load and prepare. You ride for bounty. Into the dark forest. The rest of you. Away ! As they disperse.. William sets his jaw, and heads off.. 
CUT TO: The men ride out of the village. Suddenly they stop. Standing up ahead is William, blocking their path. He calls to them. 
WILLIAM You need a bowman? FINN calls back. 
FINN I have a bowman. Away. WILLIAM stands unblinking. 
FINN I said away, damn you! WILLIAM doesn't move. Finn turns to the bowman. 
FINN Kill him.

78 CONTINUED: 78 The bowman smiles, draws his bow. BEFORE he can loose an arrow: 
THWACK! THWACK!! Two arrows strike the bowman in the throat, lifting him off his horse, stone dead. FINN turns. WILLIAM lowers his bow. 
WILLIAM I said do you need a bowman? Finn studies William with dead eyes.

BROCH Clear the road. But William doesn't budge. One of the other mercenaries grins, then rides towards William, drawing his sword. He raises it when William unslings his bow and loosens two arrows at close range, hitting him in each thigh and knocking him off his horse. Broch draws his enormous battle axe, about to charge, when Finn rides forward and stops him. 
FINN Wait! Finn sizes up William. 
FINN You're quick with a bow. 
WILLIAM I want to ride with you. 
FINN Why? 
WILLIAM You are paying well and I need the coin. 
FINN Have you traversed the Dark Forest? 
ERIC Now hold it - business end pointed at me.

SNOW WHITE What do you mean? 
(CONTINUED) 
83b CONTINUED: (2) 83b He jumps at her again and she puts her right foot forward, knife in right hand pointed. He starts to slowly move toward her. One step at a time. 
ERIC Now stay back. You're too small to attack. You have to parry; use your opponents strength against him. Raise your opposing forearm. She does. He comes closer. 
ERIC With it you block and deflect an opposing thrust. You'll lose meat but you won't die from it. Wait until I'm close. He steps forward. 
ERIC Not yet. Watch my hands, not my eyes. He moves even closer. 
ERIC Not yet. Not until you can feel my breath. He moves right up to her. 
ERIC Now. Their faces are inches apart. 
ERIC This close. Drive it through me. To the hilt. Now look in my eyes. 
(SHE DOES) Don't pull it out 'til you see my soul. Their eyes are still locked. 
SNOW WHITE Why do I need to learn how to kill? He looks at her. 
ERIC There's a lot you need to learn lass. Eric backs away. 
ERIC Keep that. She nods, now-focused on him in a way other than as an instructor. He turns and walks away.

SNOW WHITE Where are you going? 
ERIC Fumee. 
84C EXT. CLOISTER GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 84C 
A single blossom flowers on the dying apple tree. Ravenna, looking weaker than before, stares at it quietly, as if she were gazing at Snow White. She reaches out and crushes the blossom in her hand, turning it into ash. Her look is one of conviction. 
RAVENNA Find her. 
85 MOVED TO 10A 85 
86 MOVED TO 13A 86 
87 EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 87 
Finn reacts as if he heard Ravenna's words. He did. They have that kind of connection. Spooked, he continues on. The other trackers follow, William looking tense. At the back of the group, one of the mercenaries slows down, sensing something in the forest. William is still watching Finn when they hear a bloodcurdling CRY behind them. The mercenary's horse gallops out of the trees without its rider, a gaping wound in its side. William and the others look shaken but Finn doesn't even turn around, riding on. 87a EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 87a Eric pulls Snow White along. Beyond a bridge we see open fens -- the bridge LEADS OUT OF THE DARK FOREST -- and birds circling on the distant horizon. Snow White looks relieved as she follows him down a slope. They hurry through a sea of mist when suddenly Eric stops. 
SNOW WHITE What is it? 
ERIC It can't be this easy. He quietly unsheathes a hatchet. 
SNOW WHITE Is this the end of the Dark Forest? 
ERIC (not paying attention) Uh-huh. 
(CONTINUED) 
87a CONTINUED: 87a 
ERIC I don't know, but keep smiling. A beautiful LITTLE GIRL, LILY, moves away from her friends and offers her hand. Snow White stops, looks down at the girl, trying not to stare at her scar. 90-93a OMITTED 90-93a 93b EXT. BANKS OF THE LAKE/ FENLAND VILLAGE - DAY. 93b Eric sits by the lake, ANNA bandaging his wounds. 
ANNA You have travelled far Huntsman. With a heavy burden. Snow white is playing with Lily. They are making little dolls from straw. 
ERIC I've had worse jobs. And anyway, she's not that heavy. 
ANNA You mean... you do not know who she is? His eyes narrow. 
ERIC What do you mean? He looks over. 
(CONTINUED) 
52aA 93b CONTINUED: 93b 
ERIC Who is she? 
ACROSS THE WAY Snow White draws eyes upon the doll. Snow White's eyes fill with tears. 
LILY My father showed me how to make them. But he's gone away. Lily takes a stick and marks the dolls face with a scar.. 
LILY Here. She's finished. She hands it to her. 
(CONTINUED) 
52A 93b CONTINUED: (2) 93b 
SNOW WHITE She's beautiful. Lily smiles and runs off to play. Behind her Eric appears. 
SNOW WHITE These women... This place.. It's very peaceful. But it makes me very sad. 
ERIC Why didn't you tell me? She stops. She knows. 
ERIC Because I'd think it too fell a task? You'd be right. She looks at him. Shakes her head. 
SNOW WHITE That's not why. It's because I've never said the words. She looks at Lily playing. 
SNOW WHITE I'm not sure I believe it myself. I never felt like a.. (She stops.) Alone in a dark cell. For years. Fighting to cling to memories. What he looked like. Smelled like. The kind man with the big arms and the wonderful smiles.. To me.. he wasn't The King. He was my father. Eric doesn't know what to say. In time, he reaches in his pocket. 
ERIC Here. 
SNOW WHITE What is it? 
ERIC I've carried it a long time. 
SNOW WHITE What is it made of? 
ERIC Gristle from a stag's heart. (off her look) 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
52B 93b CONTINUED: (3) 93b 
ERIC (CONT'D) The stag's the most timid animal in the forest but there's a bone in it's heart that gives it courage in it's hour of need and makes it the bravest in of all God's creatures. It's a protection charm. 
(HE SHRUGS) Or so they say. They share a look. 
SNOW WHITE Was it hers? It's the most honest and emotional he's been with her. 
ERIC Take it. She does. 
SNOW WHITE Thank you, huntsman. He looks at the sky. 
ERIC It's getting dark. He walks away. 
(CONTINUED) 
93b CONTINUED: (4) 93b 
COLL That song takes me back to the battle of Tylweth Gate. A small horde versus an army. Pickaxes against swords and spears. 
DUIR Them were the days. 
(BEAT) What happened to your quailing cough? Coll shakes his head, "dunno". The two of them smile then join in the singing. A drunken GORT takes a swig of ale and staggers over to GUS. 
GORT Play louder, you whey-face, I can still hear those harpy fairies. He takes another swig and sings at the top of his voice, out of tune, trying to drown out the humming of the unseen fairies. Snow White and the huntsman look on, smiling. 
ERIC Legend has it dwarves were created to uncover all the riches hidden on earth. Not just gold and precious stones, but the beauty in people's hearts. 
SNOW WHITE Really? 
ERIC Ask me, they've lost the art if they ever had it. When the Queen seized their mines she stole their treasure but more than that she stole their pride. And as if to prove it, GORT and NION sing and share from a flask of rum before they tumble to the ground-near Muir as the song ends. Eric notices the tumble and chuckles. 
GORT What are you pribbling at, longshanks?! 
ERIC Nothing half-wit. 
GORT I'm half of nothing.you canker blossom.

64A 
130 CONTINUED: 130 
MUIR Son?... Sing the one. Perched on his stone, QUERT nods; sings a more CHEERFUL SONG. Eric watches as Snow White walks over to Muir. Before she can say anything... 
(CONTINUED) 
130 CONTINUED: (2) 130 
MUIR That seat's not taken, if that's what you were about to ask. She sits on the log beside him. Gort and Nion eye her. 
SNOW WHITE Thank you so much, sir. 
MUIR It's only a log, no need to praise me. 
SNOW WHITE No. For before. For defending me. 
MUIR Your father was a good man. The kingdom prospered. Our people prospered. 
SNOW WHITE There were more of you? 
MUIR Aye. And that is all Muir will say on the subject. Gort fills in. 
GORT One day the group you see before you went down into the mine for a month long shift. Gus was only a boy. When we came back to the surface... nothing. The land was black, everything, everyone... dead, gone. We searched but... Gort surprises himself by choking up a bit. Muir helps out. 
MUIR That was the month your father died. 
SNOW WHITE I'm so sorry. 
MUIR As am I, princess. As am I. GUS walks over to Snow White. 
GUS I know I'm a bit spongy to look at, Miss, but would you care to dance-with a little 'un? 
SNOW WHITE I'd be honored. Snow White gets up and dances with Gus as the song picks up. 
(CONTINUED) 
130 CONTINUED: (3) 130 Nion and Gort watch her dance with Gus. Nion's not impressed, leans in to Gort... 
NION I don't trust her. And I don't believe in her, no matter what Muir says. Gort is still melancholy... 
GORT Just you and me,... do you think there are any of us left? Do you think perhaps they were merely banished? 
NION As long as the Queen's in charge we'll never know. 
GORT Well, maybe that's the point, isn't it? (beat; out of the blue) I feel funny. Queer almost. 
GUS Aye! The other Dwarves trade looks. Nion, the last, shrugs. As Snow White strokes the hart's neck, the golden light brightens, engulfing her. 
-- SUDDENLY AN ARROW FLIES THROUGH THE AIR -- AND PIERCES THE 
WHITE HART'S FLANK. The HART roars in pain and bolts. The fairies and animals scatter in all directions now, their sanctuary violated. Eric looks up to see ALDAN the Yakut emerging through the trees on horseback, notching another arrow to his bow. A FIERCE WIND rips through the sanctuary now, shadows spreading where there was once light. Eric sees FINN appear on horseback, looking like a demon god in the gathering darkness. The huntsman grabs his axe. So do the dwarves, pulling on their battle masks. WILLIAM emerges through the trees to see ALDAN aiming his bow at Snow White. He rides into the Yakut's horse, knocking him off balance just as he fires -- The arrow narrowly misses Snow White, thudding into a tree. Gus grabs her by the hand. 
GUS Come on! He runs with her into the forest. Aldan turns on William furiously, drawing his curved sword, but before he can swing the dwarves attack both men -- Eric only has eyes for Finn. They stare at each other in the roaring wind, then Finn gallops into the forest after-Snow White Eric RUNS in the same direction -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) William fends off the furious dwarf attack then rides off in pursuit of snow white -- Aldan sees him but is too busy defending himself against COLL and DUIR to give chase -- 
132 EXT. ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 132 
All around the forest the shadow of death is spreading. Gus runs, dragging Snow White behind him. Galloping through the trees, WILLIAM spots them up ahead, riding faster. 
133 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 133 
Bow and arrow at the ready, Eric runs after Finn. All around him the forest is darkening. He follows the sound of galloping hooves when suddenly they stop. He stops too, notching an arrow to his bow, peering into the gloom and listening. There's a tense silence, then SUDDENLY HE HEARS A NOISE. He spins around, ready to fire, when he sees it's only Finn's riderless horse galloping past -- He realizes too late that it's a trick -- FINN EXPLODES OUT OF THE DARKNESS, catching him a glancing blow with his sword -- 
134 EXT. STONE RUINS/ GROVE/ ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 134 
Coll and Duir leap up at Aldan, trying to drag him off his horse, but he's a ferocious fighter, driving them both back -- 
135 EXT. ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 135 
William spots Snow White up ahead. She disappears into the trees and he rides faster. She erupts from behind a branch and pulls him off his horse. Gus races over and raises his axe -- 
SNOW WHITE Gus, no! Gus's axe stops inches from William's eyes. Snow White recognizes the young warrior, staring at him in surprise. 
SNOW WHITE I saw you at the village. William looks up at her, out of breath: 
WILLIAM It's me. William. Snow White stares in disbelief, tears of surprise welling in her eyes. Gus looks even more confused, lowering his axe. William slowly rises to his feet, gazing back at Snow White, when THEY HEAR A TWIG SNAP -- Gus hears it too, spinning around -- 
(CONTINUED) 
135 CONTINUED: 135 -- To see ALDAN with an arrow notched to his bow -- 
GUS 
PRINCESS! Gus launches himself -- and takes the arrow meant for Snow White. Before Aldan can load another arrow -- William fires an arrow of his own, striking him in the chest. The Yakut topples over, dead at last but still astride his horse. Snow White falls to her knees in anguish, cradling the dying Gus. He smiles weakly, holding her gaze, then whispers: 
GUS I shan't leave you, Miss. 
136 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 136 
Eric charges into Finn with a cry of rage. Finn deflects the blow and hurls him back into the trees. Driven by fury, Eric charges again, but Finn uses his anger against him, ducking under the vicious blow and landing a brutal one of his own -- Eric crashes into another tree. His eyes are still full of hatred but his body is weak. Finn smiles in contempt from a few yards away. 
FINN I captured many girls, but your wife was special. 
ERIC What?! 
FINN She fought and then she begged. For her life. Please?!!! You should know she called for you. Your Sara. 
ERIC How do you know her name?! Eric is shocked, desperate. 
FINN She told me. Just before I slit her throat. 
-ERIC Bastard... .- Eric notices a fallen TREE TRUNK behind Finn -- dead branches STICKING UP LIKE SPIKES. Finn steps toward him... 
FINN Now you can look for her in the other world and beg for her forgiveness. 
(CONTINUED) 
71A 
136 CONTINUED: 136 Finn smiles and raises his sword for the death blow -- when ERIC LUNGES. He throws himself at Finn, his momentum carrying them both into THE DEAD TREE'S SPIKED BRANCHES -- The branches pierce Finn's body, their tips digging into Eric's flesh. Finn howls in agony -- 
137 OMITTED 137 
SNOW WHITE Leave him, huntsman. He's our friend. He glares but his eyes glisten with tears. Snow White is still bowed over Gus's body, sobbing, mourning. The prayer chant ends. Nion spits with anger and walks away. 
NION We need to convene. They all follow him a few steps away, where they have privacy. 
BEITH What is it, Nion? 
NION This is what happens when dwarves mix with men. We always come out worse. We have big hearts and we'll fight for any cause -- but for what? For some new Queen to call us runts and turn us out of our homes again? 
GORT I've nothing against the girl, but I'm not willing to risk my life for her either, like poor Gus. Beith considers quietly, the other dwarves listening too. 
DUIR (whispers to Coll) Does this mean we're not fighting the Queen? 
COLL 
(WHISPERS BACK) Not sure yet. 
QUERT What about the gold he promised us? 
NION What use is gold if you're dangling by your bony neck, you jackdaw?! 
BEITH Aye, the Queen will flay us alive for helping her! 
(CONTINUED) 
144 CONTINUED: (2) 144 
MUIR The White Hart blessed the girl. Nion shakes his head and rolls his eyes, but Beith listens. 
MUIR Even our own legends speak of the redeemer who will heal the land. 
GORT That little mutton? 
MUIR All the lions and wolves in the kingdom have tried to defeat the Queen and failed. Why not a mutton? The dwarves stare at him incredulously. 
NION Gus lost his life because of her! 
MUIR No. He gave his life for her. As will I if necessary. Look at us. Look at what we've become. They trade looks. They know where he's going with this. 
MUIR We were once proud, now we pilfer and drink and dream of when we didn't. I am willing to die for a chance at becoming the man I once was. And that is the last word. Quert puts his arm around his father and kisses his forehead. Beith and Gort trade a nod and a smile. 
145 EXT. STONE RUINS/ GROVE/ ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 145 
QUERT sings a CELTIC MELODY OF LOSS as Gus is laid out on a funeral pyre. All around him, THE BRIGHT COLORS OF THE ENCHANTED FOREST HAVE FADED and there are no animals and fairies to be seen. It's as if Ravenna's shadow has passed here too. The tough, battle hardened dwarves shed tears like children. Snow White looks heartbroken as Beith lights the pyre. As the flames rise, a HAUNTING LAMENT carries us into the next scene --- 
146 OMITTED 146 
147 EXT. HILLS - DAY. 147 
Quert's SONG CONTINUES as the group make their way across the barren hills and into the mountains -- 
148 EXT. HIGHLAND HILLS - DAY. 148 
William walks alongside Snow White, glancing at her tentatively. He waits until the others are out of earshot. 
WILLIAM I'm sorry I left you. She looks over and sees the remorse in his eyes. 
SNOW WHITE You didn't. 
WILLIAM If I'd known you were alive I would have come sooner. 
SNOW WHITE We were children, William. You're here now. They reach some steep rocks and Eric turns around, offering Snow White his hand. She takes it and he helps her up the slope. William looks on, feeling jealous. Beith follows Duir and Coll up to the summit of the hill, then looks at the surrounding peaks. 
BEITH We'll rest the night at the top of this hill. 148a INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - ROYAL PALACE - DAY. 148a From above - Ravenna stands in the center of the room, surrounded by ravens. She raises her arms and they take flight, circling above her. She lowers her arms and their swirling pattern lowers, until she is completely surrounded by them - a tornado of ravens. She has become them, and they her. 
149 EXT. CAMP SITE/ MOUNTAINS - NIGHT. 149 
A FIRE CRACKLES. The dwarves have set up camp. Coll and Duir sit on a rocky outcrop, Coll braiding Duir's hair while Duir sharpens his axe. 
COLL That's not how you sharpen an axe. You sharpen downward. Not upward.. 
WILLIAM The same way you led me when we were children. I followed you everywhere. Ran when you called. I would have done anything for you. She looks touched by his words, smiling softly, trying to make light of them. 
SNOW WHITE That's not how I remember it. 
WILLIAM No? 
SNOW WHITE No... They gaze into each other's eyes, close enough to kiss. 
SNOW WHITE I remember we were always arguing. And fighting. And... She trails off, lost in his gaze. He stops, leans closer and kisses her gently. They stay like that a moment, then William pulls away, holding something in his hand. Snow White smiles as she sees that it's an APPLE. With a mischievous smile, William holds out the apple for Snow White, just like he did when they were children. 
SNOW WHITE I remember this trick. 
WILLIAM (With mock innocence) What trick? Snow White holds his gaze, then snatches the apple from him before he can take a bite, raising it to her lips with a smile. As she bites -- 150b OMITTED 150b 150c OMITTED 150c 150d EXT. CAMP SITE/ MOUNTAINS - DAWN. 150d. Eric, startled,- awakens. 
150e EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAWN. 150e As Snow White chews, a flicker of a smile crosses William's face. Snow White stares curiously, then suddenly gasps, struggling to breathe -- 150f EXT. CAMP SITE/ MOUNTAINS - DAWN. 150f Eric stands up, looks around, dwarves still asleep. He shakes William, who wakes at the ready. They walk into the trees and follow -- 
A SINGLE SET OF TRACKS. 150g EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAWN. 150g Snow White staggers back and collapses in the snow, choking from poison. Her eyes water and her vision blurs. The false William kneels beside her and slowly she sees Ravenna's features burning through, her cold blue eyes gleaming in 
TRIUMPH -- A SCREAM fills the air -- not Snow White but dozens of birds shrieking in the sky above -- 
151-157 OMITTED 151-157 
158 EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY. 158 
Eric and William hear the panicked bird cries and run -- 158a EXT. SILVER BIRCH TREES/ MOUNTAINS - DAY. 158a Snow White's limbs are petrified, frost spreading across her cheeks -- but her eyes are open, taking in everything. Ravenna leans over her, smiling. 
RAVENNA You see, child, love always betrays us. A sigh escapes Snow White's lips, condensing into steam. 
RAVENNA By fairest blood it was done and only by fairest blood can it be undone. You- were the only one who could break the-spell and end my life, and the only one pure enough to save me. She draws away, unwrapping her sacramental dagger. 
RAVENNA You don't realize how lucky you are, never to know what it is to grow old. 
(CONTINUED) 
158a CONTINUED: 158a She raises the knife, about to cut out Snow White's heart - 
WHEN SUDDENLY HER BODY SHATTERS INTO A FLOCK OF SHRIEKING 
RAVENS -- And now we see the HUNTSMAN STANDING THERE, AXE IN HAND, THE 
RAVENS FLAPPING AROUND HIM -- William blasts with a sword at the screeching birds -- Eric goes after her now, swinging his twin hatchets. The ravens scream and pluck at his eyes but he hacks at them fiercely, William joining in, until the shrieking birds finally take to the sky and vanish on the horizon. Eric and William rush to Snow White's side now. The dwarves arrive too, hurrying through the snow. William cradles Snow White in his arms, trying to revive her, but it's no use. Eric stares in dismay as he sees the poison drain the color from her lips. He kneels down and gazes at her. William turns to the dwarves. 
WILLIAM What are you looking at? Help her! The dwarves stare back at him gravely but don't respond. He's desperate now, irrational -- 
WILLIAM You are dwarves, healers, save her! He grabs the blind seer, MUIR, shaking him. 
WILLIAM Do something! Muir stares back at him with his empty eyes, tears glistening in them. William collapses in prayer, the light in Snow White's eyes almost gone. Eric looks over, sees William's grief is as great as his own, and finally stops fighting. Snow White looks up at William as if she wants to say something, then the light in her eyes goes out. The dwarves are heartbroken. Eric looks dazed. William leans down and kisses Snow White gently on the lips. He pulls away,.hoping against hope. And then -- Nothing happens. She lies there, lifeless and white as the falling snow. On all the faces - realizing that she is truly gone.

161 INT. MIRROR ROOM - DAY. 161 
The ravens burst into the mirror room and "crash" to the ground. Their swirl becomes -- Ravenna, on all fours, looking worse for wear, surrounded by dead ravens. The effort depleted her. She GROWLS as she crawls toward the mirror.

171 INT. GENERAL'S TENT - NIGHT. 171 
The council session continues. Duke Hammond stares at William gravely. 
DUKE HAMMOND My duty is to protect the people who come to me for help. I will defend them with my last drop of blood but I will not abandon these walls. I cannot afford to believe in miracles. He suddenly stops as the SHOUTS outside the tent get louder. He goes to the flap, opens it to see -- Snow White , still dressed in her white funeral robes, stands at the top of the stairs that leads down into the courtyard. 171a EXT. COURTYARD - DUKE HAMMOND'S CASTLE 171a Everyone comes out of their tents and stands beneath Snow White. Her heart pounding, she makes her way down the stairs. All are riveted by the sight of her, as if they're looking on an angel or a living miracle. Eric makes his way back into the courtyard and he, too, is stunned as he slides in next to the dwarves in the crowd. 
BEITH It's a miracle! Duke Hammond, embarrassed and still stunned by the sight of her, walks up the stairs to greet her. Several Generals follow him but stay a few steps below them. Hammond takes her by the hands as they speak. 
DUKE HAMMOND Your highness... (He can't believe his eyes) We thought you... 
SNOW WHITE No, my lord. William, below, stares at her in joy while his father still looks dazed. 
(CONTINUED) 
171a CONTINUED: 171a 
DUKE HAMMOND You must rest - 
SNOW WHITE I have rested long enough. Her voice is gentle but full of quiet conviction. 
SNOW WHITE I am ready to ride by your side, my lord, when you face the Queen in battle. The Duke looks speechless for a moment. 
DUKE HAMMOND There will be no battle, your highness. The best thing you can do for your people is stay safe behind these walls. 
SNOW WHITE That is all I thought to do when I escaped. But I have come to learn there is no peace while others suffer. Have you not learned that? 
DUKE HAMMOND The Queen cannot be defeated. She cannot be killed. And therefore there can be no victory. Snow White hesitates, her heart pounding, then replies: 
SNOW WHITE I can vanquish her. Defeat her. I am the only one. She told me so herself. Duke Hammond starts to object, but Snow White's eyes and, now her feet, lead her down the stairs to her people. When she reaches the last step - now at their level - she speaks... 
SNOW WHITE I have been told that I represent you, that it is my place to inspire you. That is wronct. I am not a Queen, not a leader, not a warrior. Absolute silence in the courtyard as people, lords, knights hang on her every word. 
SNOW WHITE You represent me, who I've become - your hopes,: your courage, your will - inspires me. 
(BEAT) I have also been told my place is not to fight but to stay here, safely behind these walls. I will not.

SNOW WHITE If Ravenna comes for me, I will ride to meet her. And if she doesn't, I will ride to meet her. (looks back at Generals) Alone if I must. (back to people) But if you would join me, I will gladly give my life for you. For this land and its people have lost too much. Eric and the dwarves couldn't look prouder. Duke Hammond stares at her for a moment, then BOWS. A beat, then William follows, then all the Lords and Knights. His eyes fixed on Snow White, Eric bows too. Then Beith. Then Muir and his son, Quert. Then Coll and Duir. And finally even Gort and Nion. Snow White stands alone, overwhelmed by the faith of the kneeling warriors, and the responsibility on her shoulders. 171b INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - ROYAL PALACE - NIGHT. 171b Ravenna raises her head to look into the mirror. 
MIRROR MAN Yes, my Queen! Yes!!!! The Mirror Man laughs because Ravenna's face is younger, her energy has returned and we see why when -- WE PULL BACK to reveal several CRONES, young only minutes before, now old and lying on the floor. Ravenna smiles, girding herself for the fight to come.

She is happy to see him. 
Coll and Duir wade through the sewage, their axes held up in front of them, not a flicker of emotion on their faces. 
DUIR Seven dwarves against an army.

SNOW WHITE Then we should ride now. They'll have the portcullis up by the time we arrive. Duke Hammond considers, then raises his sword. Snow white glances at the huntsman.

189 CONTINUED: 189 Fire rains down on the Duke's army now, panic spreading in the ranks. Snow White takes her father's banner and holds it aloft, rallying the men and riding on. 
190 EXT. GATEHOUSE - DAWN. 190 
Two unsuspecting guards collapse outside the gatehouse. Before the other guards can react, Coll and Duir are on them, moving fast and hard, the assault over in seconds. 
191 EXT. SEWER MANHOLE/ COURTYARD - DAWN. 191 
Beith sees Coll and Duir signal from outside the gatehouse. 
BEITH Come on! 
192 EXT. BEACH - DAWN. 192 
Waves crash over the rocks. Fireballs explode in the sand. Snow White sees men falling all around her, tears welling in her eyes, but she never falters. As William rides on, he sees the castle walls through the smoke, the portcullis still down. 
193 INT. GATEHOUSE -- DAWN. 193 
207 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY. 207 
Snow White storms into the throne room. She is breathing heavily, a mix of fear and determination. 
KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK The raven claw ring, taps, resonating through the halls. Ravenna stands at the top of the stairs, the mirror room behind her. Snow White approaches. 
SNOW WHITE It ends today... I have come for YOU! 
RAVENNA 
(MOCKINGLY) My rose has returned (looking at Gus' small sword) .with a thorn! 207a OMITTED 207a 
(CONTINUED) 
207a CONTINUED: 207a 
208 OMITTED 208 
209 OMITTED 209 209a INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY. 209a Eric, William and a dozen men rush in. Ravenna smiles, raises her hand. 
RAVENNA I'll show you thorns! In a terrifying tremor, the black ceiling of the throne room starts to shatter into millions of shards. Snow White turns back to see William, Eric and Hammond's men - the shards fall down like razor blades. The men try to protect themselves. Some are caught out and skewered to the stone floor. Ravenna looks down at them in complete satisfaction. 
The millions of black shards circle around Eric and his men, completely blocking them and keeping them away from Snow White. 
RAVENNA Come! ... Avenge your father, who was too weak to raise his sword. The millions of shards assemble themselves into three seven foot tall, razor sharp creatures. The DARK FAERIES: Ravenna's ultimate soldiers. Snow White looks at Eric and William - unable to help her. 
(CONTINUED) 
209a CONTINUED: 209a Eric, William and the other men are completely surrounded by these creatures; they move so fast. Eric tries to step away from them... to no avail. One of the creatures rises in front of William. William tries to slash the creature. His sword goes through and the creature reforms itself right away. The Dark Faerie opens it's mouth and screeches. William gets smashed aside, saved only by his shield. The Dark Faerie grabs the soldier right behind William and sends him crashing into the wall. Snow White walks up the stairs, torn and powerless. She looks at Eric one last time. Eric looks back as he fights off a Dark Faerie with his two shields. He knows he does not have much time left but he is ready to make the final sacrifice. 
ERIC (battle cry!) Kill her! 209b INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - DAY. 209b Snow White braces herself and promptly follows Ravenna into the mirror room. Now Snow White is exactly where Ravenna wants her to be. The two women circle each other like heavyweight boxers. 
SNOW WHITE Ten years you locked me away! Ravenna seems to relish this. 
RAVENNA And every day, every hour led you to this ,moment. It burned inside you. It drove you forward, and here you are.. Listening only to her heart, Snow White lunges towards Ravenna and tries - strikes at her with her sword. Ravenna steps aside and with very little effort - throws her to the other side of the room. 
RAVENNA That's it. Fight. Fight for your land... for your loss and for Hope! 
(CONTINUED) 
96A 209b CONTINUED: 209b Snow White slams and slides across the floor, she stops under the archway at the top of the stairs. She is dazed. Ravenna treads on her back, then grabs her hair, pulls her head up to see William and his men being massacred. 
RAVENNA Watch them die. You gave them hope and they believed you. You have lead them to their deaths. How foolish your followers. 
209c INT. THRONE ROOM - SAME - DAY 209c Eric is trying to stay alive. He rams a Faerie into a pillar. Shredding the stone, the Faerie explodes in shards and reforms immediately behind Eric. Grabbing the first man in sight, the Faerie throws the poor soldier to the other side of the room. on the opposite side another Faerie slides faster than the blink of an eye, grabs the man in flight extending it's cutting limbs and claws the soldier to his death. It is like carnage in slow motion. 209d OMITTED 209d 209e MOVED TO 209B 209e 
210 INT. THRONE ROOM - SAME - DAY. 210 
William is being overrun by a school of shards. The shards shape up into a Faerie taking William up high. In a violent arm blow, the Faerie projects William onto the banquet table six feet lower. The table shatters in splinters, William bouncing like a rag doll. Spinning around on it's way down, the Faerie skewers a soldier and impales another one into a pillar. The Faerie drags him ten feet up, tearing and digging deep into the stone column. 
211 INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - DAY. 211 
Enraged, Snow White jolts her body and frees herself from Ravenna's grasp. She swings her sword at Ravenna. She parries every attack with her bare hands. Snow White is breathless. One more strike... but Ravenna blocks it again, and this time she doesn't let go. 
(CONTINUED) 
97A 
211 CONTINUED: 211 
RAVENNA (face to face with Snow White) You were never ready for this princess! Snow White struggles to get out of her lock. Ravenna is too strong. Snow White's wrist is twisted. She holds her sword tight but can't use it. Ravenna forces the twist. Her fragile bones crack. Snow White screams in pain. The sword drops on the ground. 
SNOW WHITE 
(GRUNTING) I will... defeat... you... I am the only... 
RAVENNA Oh... please! Ravenna back hands Snow White, sending her crashing to the wall. SLAM! Cuts on her face. Ravenna looms closer, through the fire in the middle of the room. She stands IN the fire, unaffected. For Snow White it is a vision of pure hell. So much power, so much hate. 
RAVENNA I have lived many lives. Ravaged entire kingdoms, I have been given powers you can't fathom. You cannot defeat ME? .you are but a child!

Revised First Draft 
NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS AND SOME "OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. 
NOTE ALSO: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT WAS IN THE NON- PREFORMAT FONT "TIMES NEW ROMAN". THIS HAS BEEN CHANGED TO PREFORMATTED TEXT FOR THIS SOFT COPY. 
Though mentioned often in the script, the creatures in PITCH BLACK are seldom seen at length; rather, they are glimpsed, they are heard, they are felt. They are, really, the embodiment of your nocturnal fears: A howling coyote that jars you awake; the painting on the wall that comes to life when stared at too long...the sway of your bed just before the earthquake hits. Chimera of the night. The point is made so the reader appreciates that the focus of the finished film will not be on what the creatures do, but on what the creatures do to reveal the inner nature of the characters. For PITCH BLACK is, at its heart, a story of humanity and courage -- and lack of the same.

CUT IN: 
INT. MAIN CABIN 
A CRYO-LOCKER BLOWS OPEN, spitting out... 
CAROLYN FRY. She hits the deck of the main cabin: Four crew lockers in a forward section, countless more in back. But the deck is canted at a sick angle and ALARMS SCREAM everywhere: The world is dying around her. 
Legs wobbly, shivering like a flu victim, Fry stumbles to the next forward locker. It's riddled with holes. One DEAD CREWIE is seen through fractured plexi, body pocked and bloodied. But in the next cryo-locked... 
The CAPTAIN is struggling awake. Fry's face floods with relief. Slapping an intercom: 
FRY Hear me? Cap'n? Some kinda compromise to the hull...holding for now, but...Goddamn, I'm glad you're alive. Gotta pull your E-release...no, red handle, red handle. I'll get the warm-ups out while -- 
PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT: Particles bore through the cabin, blasting open the captain's chest, shattering plexi, DETONATING INSTRUMENTS on the opposite wall and leaving CONTRAILS HISSING in the air. 
Fry lands on her ass, horrified. Suddenly... 
Another LOCKER BLOWS OPEN. A body falls right on top of Fry -- but this one's still alive. Disoriented, frantic: 
OWENS Why did I fall on you? 
FRY He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when -- 
OWENS I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall at all? 
FRY You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too. 
OWENS Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. I'm Owens. Right? 
They swap nightmare looks, momentarily unsure of their own identities. 
FRY Cryo-sleep. Swear to God, it sloughs brain cells. 
INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN 
They stumble into nav-bay. ALARMS CONTINUE. Fry grabs warm-up suits out of storage, pitches one to Owens, checks her screens. 
FRY 1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. Somethin' took a swipe at us. 
OWENS Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space.... 
Owens activates an exterior view: A planet rushes up at us. That's why they have gravity. 
FRY Jesus God.... 
EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY 
The SHIP PLOWS through the upper atmosphere, antennae pylons already disintegrating. 
INT. PASSAGE TO FLIGHT DECK 
Heart battering her ribs, Fry runs forward, using hand-holds to steady herself. Over a headset: 
OWENS (V.O.) They trained you for this, right? Fry? FRY? 
FRY I'm not dying for them. 
She pushes it. But this time... 
EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY 
No bolts fire. Nothing separates from the SHIP THAT SCREAMS DOWN through the clouds. 
INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN 
Now we see why: Owens reopened the jettison doors locally -- and blocked them open. 
FRY Owens! 
OWENS 70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out! 
INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY 
Seething anger and guilt, Fry pops more airbrakes, shedding more speed, more heat. The ship does level -- but it's still being pounded hellishly. She tries to get a stable view out... 
The windscreen. We're breaking through cloud-bottoms. There's just a glimpse of landscape before... 
EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY 
An airbrake fails. It shears off and pinwheels into... 
INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY 
The windscreen. It cracks into a thousand spiderwebs -- but impossibly it holds. For now. 
OWENS (V.O.) What the shit was that? 
Sunlight flares from every fractured edge: It's like looking into burning diamonds, and Fry can only get an impression of the outside world. Now she has to rely on... 
A ground-mapping display. 120 meters altitude. And dropping. 
INT. CRYO-LOCKER - DAY 
INTERCUT Johns. Realizing he's in some kind of shit-storm, he claws at safety restraints. 
INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY 
Ground-mapper: 60 meters. COLLISION ALARMS kick in. 
Out the fractured windscreen, we see a huge dark mass rise up into view. Land. 
40 meters...30...20...10.... 
Fry braces. 
IMPACT. The WINDSCREENS IMPLODE. AIR HURRICANES in. 
INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN 
IMPACT. Chairs rip from their moorings. Strapped into one, Owens slams into the ceiling. 
INT. MAIN CABIN - DAY 
IMPACT. Johns BLOWS OUT of his locker -- and wishes to God he would've stayed inside, because just beside him... 
The hull is cracking open. 
NIGHTMARE SHOT: A huge section of the cabin tears free... skitters and CRASHES along the planetfloor behind us...and disintegrates out of sight. 40 cryo-lockers vanished with it. 40 lives. 
INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY 
Hammered by WIND, Fry opens her eyes experimentally. 
FRY'S POV: A vortex of motion, of speed, of blurring debris. But the ship is burrowing in. Burrowing under. 
Fry pivots her chair 180 degrees a nanosecond before... Dirt avalanches into the cockpit. It buries CAMERA. 
BLACKOUT 
INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY 
Choking yellow dust. Ghostly silhouettes are COUGHING, MOANING, CALLING OUT to other survivors in English and, surreally, in Arabic. Soon we find... 
Four male "Chrislams": The pillar-steady IMAM (50ish), and THREE PILGRIMS, young and excitable (late-teens). (NOTE: The Chrislams represent a union between Christianity and Islam. They have the iconography of Christians yet the physical look of Arab Muslims.) 
WIDE SHOT: All around them is stark and unforgiving terrain. The valley floor is relieved only by low hills to one side, spiked with earthen spires. Scorching down on everything are two suns -- one red, one yellow. 
PARIS Well. Our own little slice of heaven. 
The Chrislams fall to their knees. Confusion as they try to orient themselves. 
IMAM Please...which way to New Mecca? We must know the direction in order to pray. 
North? South? East? West? Nobody knows. Johns snaps open a compass, finds the needle swaying rudderlessly. The SCREAMING inside the ship finally ends. 
INT. CRASH SHIP - DAY 
As Fry holds Owens, now dead. 
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY 
The four Chrislams have devised a way to pray: Backs together, each faces a different compass point. 
EXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY 
Fry climbs onto the back of the ship. Johns Paris, Zeke, Shazza, Audrey are already here. 
JOHNS Big talk about a scouting party... 
Fry sees the huge smoldering scar in the ground behind the ship. One glance confirms that there are no other survivors. 
JOHNS (CONT'D) ...then we saw this. 
PARIS Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me? 
AUDREY Like I just ran, or something.... 
SHAZZA Feel one lung short. All of us. 
PARIS Well, I tend toward the asthmatic. And with all this dust.... 
Faces turn to Fry: They're looking to her for answers. 
FRY It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to -- 
ZEKE So what the bloody hell happened, anyways? 
FRY Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know. 
SHAZZA Well, I for one, am thoroughly fucking grateful. This beast wasn't made to land like this. But cripes, you rode it down. (to others) C'mon, you lousy ingrates, only reason we're alive is a'cuzza her. 
Others CHIME AGREEMENT, laying thankful hands on Fry's shoulders. HOLD on Fry, her face betraying nothing as they anoint her their savior. 
INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY 
Breaking out pressure suits: 
FRY Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last. 
AUDREY Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse? (off their looks) Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me. 
SHAZZA We're worried you'll scare us. (ushering her away) Name's "Audrey," right, love? And you're goin' to Taurus Three like we were? 
AUDREY Yeah, but...do we even have enough food to get there? Or will we have to resort to cannibalism? 
ZEKE (to Fry) I'll see 'bout makin' this air go a bit further, cap'n. With your permission, a' course. 
Fry blinks. "They actually think I'm the captain." Zeke and the others get to work. Fry finds herself staring at another problem. Riddick. 
FRY And him? 
JOHNS Big Evil? 
FRY We just keep him locked up forever? 
JOHNS Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on -- 
FRY I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous? 
JOHNS Only around humans. 
Nav-bay. Gathered, the survivors take inventory: Johns has a pistol, shotgun, baton. Zeke and Shazza offer up a pick-ax, digging tools, hunting boomerang. Imam shows a ceremonial blade. Paris straggles in with antique curios. 
JOHNS What the hell are these? 
PARIS Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare. 
ZEKE An' this? 
PARIS Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very very rare, since the tribe's extinct. 
ZEKE 'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess. 
PARIS Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us? 
JOHNS First, because he can only live out there for so long -- he's gonna come back and take what we got. Second, for the sheer thrill of the kill. 
A beat. They all grab for weapons. 
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY 
Johns stands atop the crash ship, scanning with a scope. He fixates on... 
A blue glow on the horizon. "What the hell is it?" 
Zeke and Shazza modify breather units, adding straps and tubing and ball-floats. The prototype is tested on Audrey. She sucks on the mouthpiece -- and finds that it works, supplying oxygen on demand rather than in a constant flow. 
Chrislams convert to traditional bedouin head-gear, readying for travel. 
Fry finishes wrapping Owens' body. She looks to the yellow sun, low on the horizon. The red sun seems inclined to follow. 
FRY Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler. 
ZEKE What, you're goin' off, too? 
FRY Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad. 
SHAZZA A'course we will. 
PILGRIM #1 (O.S.) Imam...Imam.... 
(NOTE: "Imam" is pronounced "el-ee-MAM.") 
Fry and the others round the ship to see... 
A blue star flaring into view. It's rising as the other suns are setting. 
SHAZZA My bloody oath.... 
AUDREY Three suns? 
ZEKE (to Fry) So much for your nightfall. 
PARIS So much for my cocktail hour. 
IMAM We take this to be a good sign -- a path, a direction from God. 
Johns swings down from the top of the ship. 
JOHNS A very good sign. (re: blue sun) That's Riddick's direction. You do not wanna be caught in the dark with this guy. 
FRY Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset. 
JOHNS (nodding) Which means he went toward sunrise. 
EXT. PLANET - DAY 
Trekking, the Chrislams waft incense pots and CHANT FROM THE KORAN as they head toward the blue star. Johns provides shotgun escort; Fry carries Paris' second war-pick on a shoulder. Silhouetted against the alien sky, the scouting party is an odd, odd sight. 
Already sun-battered, Johns crafts an eye-visor out of plexi. Fry tries to wrap her head like the Chrislams. Imam helps. 
FRY So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then.... 
IMAM You know who Muhammad was? 
FRY Some prophet guy? 
IMAM "Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God. 
Fry nods. Johns smiles, leaves. Just as her heart settles, SOMETHING CREAKS behind her. 
It's an orrery, a mechanical device that shows the motion of the planets around their suns. Solar powered, the orrery starts turning, CREAKING. One planet seems always to have sunlight. 
FRY No darkness. No lights because no darkness.... 
EXT. PORCH - SETTLEMENT - DAY 
Fry reaches a porch. It looks out over the rear of the settlement and more unforgiving terrain. She starts back inside -- but something glints at the edge of her vision. Fry turns back...parts clothes on a laundry line...and sees the source of the glint. 
Excited hits on her breather. 
Fry vaults off the porch -- and starts walking as if on magnetic bearing. Soon she's running. 
EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY 
FRY (V.O.) Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! 
Johns and the Chrislams trade looks. 
EXT. SKIFF - DAY 
FRY Allahu Akbar! 
Fry stops on a groomed runway, out of breath. The others catch up. They too marvel at... 
The skiff, a light-duty vehicle of hybrid technology -- part bush plane, part space craft. Its fabric wings are wind-torn -- but the hull looks intact. 
EXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY 
CLOSE on caviar being added to toast-points. 
A SCRABBLING SOUND stops Paris in mid-bite. He eases out of his rocker, moves to the rear edge of the ship and looks down on... 
A shadow ducking under him. Small rocks still trickle down a dirt rampart just climbed by...someone. 
PARIS This now qualifies as the worst fun I've ever had. Stop it. 
No response. 
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY 
War-pick in hand, Paris eases to ground-level. He checks the perimeter, looks inside the ship. Nobody. Is he being fucked with? Again? He hopes? 
PARIS Audrey? Oh, Audrey.... 
AUDREY (O.S.) What? 
Paris spins. The voice came from the cargo hold -- and not where he expected. 
INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY 
Blades of sunlight stream in through cracks in the hull. Paris enters to find Shazza and Audrey cutting open containers, searching for usable goods. 
PARIS Tell me that was you. 
AUDREY Okay, it was me. What'd I do now? 
PARIS Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what. 
SHAZZA What're you goin' on about? She's been right here for the last.... 
They all see it: Sun-blades are momentarily blocked by something passing outside. Someone. 
SHAZZA (a quiet probe) Zeke? 
No answer. Audrey springs to the other side of hold, puts an eye to a crack there. 
HULL-CRACK POV: Far away, Zeke finishes digging the grave. He starts toward the ship. 
Audrey whirls back, mouths a silent alarm: "RIDDICK!" 
Paris goes bloodless. Shazza grabs the war-pick out of his frozen hands, moves catlike to the main doors and poises there, ready to strike. Audrey follows with the hunting boomerang. All eyes watch as... 
The sun-blades, winking off and on, chart Riddick's approach: We feel like we're inside a magician's sword box, watching the blades shave closer and closer to us. Suddenly he appears... 
And Shazza swings hard. 
JOHNS ...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie.... 
FRY Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what.... 
She hauls him off -- only to have Shazza start punching Riddick. 
SHAZZA What'd you do with 'im? You bloody sick animal you, what'dja do with me Zeke? 
EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY 
Fry and Johns stand over the grave. It's a gory mess -- but no sign of Zeke. Johns has Riddick's confiscated shiv. 
FRY He used that? 
JOHNS Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut. 
FRY So why isn't it all bloody? 
JOHNS I assume he licked it clean. 
INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY 
Riddick is back in chains, face pulpy from the beating, listening to SOTTO VOCE VOICES outside. Fry enters, looks at him hard. 
FRY So where is he? 
Riddick turns away, revealing a broken goggle-lens. The eye beneath is closed: For some reason, he won't look at her. 
FRY Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before.... (no response) If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull. 
RIDDICK 'Mean the whispers? 
FRY What whispers? 
RIDDICK The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight. 
Fry stares. Riddick gets a black satisfaction from his role as Boogeyman: If fear is the only kind of respect he can get, Riddick is going to grab some with both hands. 
FRY Why don't we try the truth now? 
A head-shaking beat, then: 
RIDDICK All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now. 
FRY Show me your eyes. 
Again he turns away. She strips the goggles off. He sits with lids shut tight, anticipating the pain. 
FRY Show me, Riddick. 
Imagine a virgin undressing in front of someone for the first time. That's how Riddick opens his eyes, startling us: No irises, just huge black-pool pupils. And from deep within, a jewel-like eyeshine. His eyes are as beautiful and unsettling as those of a starved jaguar. 
FRY You did this? To yourself? 
RIDDICK Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor." 
FRY Heard about it. Just never seen it. 
RIDDICK Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns. (replacing goggles) Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time. 
FRY Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked. 
RIDDICK Look deeper. 
He CLICKS HIS TONGUE at her. 
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY 
Chain looped over one shoulder, Fry heads back to the grave site. Johns, Imam, Shazza, and Audrey keep pace as... 
JOHNS I know what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to -- 
FRY Let's just be sure. 
JOHNS I am sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into -- 
FRY We're gonna find the body, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it. 
They drop down and suspend their heads over the bloody grave, listening. Nothing now. 
INT. SPIRE - DAY 
FRY I'm over here in the -- 
Something tugs on her chain. 
FRY Oh, God.... 
CLOSE on her feet. Kicking hard at the walls, trying to gouge out footholds. 
A stronger tug. Fry loses altitude, slipping closer to... 
The MADLY CLICKING LAIR below. 
She tries to jettison her belt -- but can't brace herself up and undo the belt. Suddenly... 
Something explodes near her head. Daylight appears, followed by faces, human faces. They're breaking through the spire with the pick-ax. Hands reach inside... 
EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DAY 
...and birth her into daylight. Overlapping: 
JOHNS We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now.... 
IMAM The child heard you before any of us could even.... 
SHAZZA Did you find him? You find Zeke? 
FRY (half insane) ...wasn't Riddick...it was...it was... goddamn, that was stupid....but wasn't Riddick. Somethin' else down there that got Zeke and nearly got -- 
Her. She flies back into the spire. Something's still got the chain. 
The others grab at flailing limbs. It's a tug-of-war now, human hands on one end, unseen "hands" on the other -- and the humans are losing. Until... 
Imam unsheathes his blade... 
And slices through Fry's belt. 
INT. SPIRE - DAY 
As the chain falls down the spire. Without Fry. 
INT./EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY 
FAST SHOTS: Survivors packing up O2, liquor, umbrellas, the Koran -- whatever qualifies as "essential" on this planet. Amid the activity, Audrey pauses to look at... 
The spired hills. 
INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY 
Fry and Imam pull a power cell from the ship's battery bay, THUMPING it down on the deck. 
IMAM One is all? 
FRY For now. 
INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY 
At his personal locker, Johns digs out a box of shotgun shells. He bypasses the blue-metal shells for a red-metal one. There's something special about it -- though what, we can't be sure. 
INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY 
A shadow falls over Riddick. He doesn't look up. 
RIDDICK Found somethin' worse than me, huh? 
JOHNS We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now. 
Now their eyes meet. Johns RATCHETS HIS SHOTGUN and points it at Riddick's head. 
RIDDICK Woof, woof. 
The SHOTGUN EXPLODES. CAMERA PANS off of Johns to show Riddick still alive. The shotgun discharged next to his head and blew off his wrist chains. 
JOHNS Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't. 
JOHNS Little ratty-ass. 
FRY Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts. 
SHAZZA Not a star-jumper. 
RIDDICK Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up. (to Fry) Right? 
Fry looks from Riddick to Johns. "How did he know that?" 
FRY Little help here? 
They muscle the power cell aboard. Riddick starts to follow, but Johns blocks. He doesn't want Riddick inside. 
JOHNS Check those containers for me. See what we can patch wings with. 
EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY 
With religious fervor, the Chrislams are repairing the moisture- recovery unit -- the machine Allah led them to. 
INT. SKIFF - DAY 
START on the battery bay. Hands are adapting the power cell to the skiffs older electrical system. Soon... 
Lights wink on throughout the ship. 
FRY Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells. 
JOHNS How many? 
FRY 15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch. 
JOHNS 25 kilos each, huh? 
SHAZZA Old sand-cat outside. See if I can't get it up and chuggin'. 
JOHNS Do it. And if you need an extra hand, tap our problem child out.... (looking out) Where's Riddick? 
EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY 
He's walking the ghost town, finding dead gardens...upended chairs and furniture...broken skylights. Behind his back... 
Audrey and Pilgrim #3 (the youngest Chrislam) scurry through FRAME, stalking this curious monster in their midst. 
EXT. MOISTURE-RECOVERY UNIT - SETTLEMENT - DAY 
CLOSE on the other Chrislams, faces charged with anticipation while awaiting... 
The first drop of water. It appears at the bottom of a pipette. 
Tongues fight for it. Another drop forms in its place. Now another and another. It brings CHEERS. 
INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY 
CLOSE on Paris' hands. Getting ready to celebrate, he unwraps crystal goblets...dusts off the refectory table...and rehangs an old Christmas garland. INTERCUT WITH... 
EXT. CORING ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY 
Hands digging in dirt. 
Covertly, Audrey and Pilgrim #3 watch Riddick digging near the entrance of a tall windowless structure. 
He excavates a pair of broken eyeglasses... a shattered light... and a child's tin robot, timeless. Riddick thumbs a solar panel clean. The robot's language program warbles to life: 
ROBOT "...to all intruders. I am the guardian of this land. I will protect my masters at all cost. Death to all intruders..." 
Riddick stands and tries the doors. Locked. He peers through a small filthy window. Is there something moving inside? Nothing now. Riddick removes some windblown trash from a doorside sign. "Coring Room." 
JOHNS (O.S.) Missin' the party. C'mon. 
It's Johns, keeping him on a short leash. Leaving, Riddick kicks a trash bin. Hard. 
RIDDICK Missin' the party. C'mon. 
He leaves. HOLD on the trash bin a beat. 
AUDREY (O.S.) Talkin' to me? 
IMAM Ali.... 
INT. CORING ROOM - DAY 
CHAOTIC SHOTS: More NESTS EXPLODE into individual creatures, winged hatchlings moving like bats in a fire, talons hacking and slashing. His exit blocked, Pilgrim #3 veers into... 
A dark supply room. He slams the door, MUMBLES A BLESSING and waits for the storm to pass. He's been cut -- but at least he's still alive. 
EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY 
As the survivors run for the coring room. 
INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY 
As Riddick stays behind to drink their water. 
INT. CORING ROOM - DAY 
HINGES ARE BLASTED AWAY. The door caves in. Imam shoulders past Johns to enter and find... 
The empty coring room. 
IMAM Ali? 
A NOISE from the supply room. Is it Ali? Just too scared to come out? Imam opens the door... 
And hatchlings pour out. 
Moving with a gang-intelligence, they circle the room in a wave, soar high into the rafters -- then plunge into the coring shaft, SQUEALS VANISHING to infinity. Shocked silence, then... 
Pilgrim #3 tumbles to the ground. He's been shredded into bloody kite-tails. There was a nest inside the supply room. 
Imam falls on him in grief. Johns and Fry inch forward to peer down... 
The coring shaft. It's littered with human bones. The skeletons of the settlers. Scattered about and picked clean. 
EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY 
Against a blue sunrise, the Chrislams hold a prayer service. Paris and Audrey attend. Riddick watches from afar. 
INT. CORING ROOM - DAY 
SHAZZA Why was the door chained up? Why the bloody hell would they lock themselves in like that? 
JOHNS Not sure, but tell you what: Chrislams better not be diggin' another grave out there. 
RIDDICK (O.S.) Other buildings weren't secure... 
They turn. Riddick enters. 
RIDDICK (CONT'D) ...so they ran here. Heaviest doors. Thought they'd be safe inside, but... (looks down shaft) Someone forget to lock the back door. 
Shazza joins him at the shaft. Gazing on the human remains: 
SHAZZA So that's what come of me Zeke. An' you saw it. You was right there. 
Riddick nods. 
SHAZZA (CONT'D) You were tryin' to kill him too. 
RIDDICK (shrugging, "not necessarily") Just wanted his O-2. (a beat) Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead. 
Shazza can't deny it. She looks at him differently now, the man she once beat while in chains. She takes off her breather. 
SHAZZA Take it. 
RIDDICK (suspicious) What, it's broken? 
SHAZZA Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it. 
Riddick accepts it awkwardly, sucks down some pure O2. Johns watches the exchange closely, not much liking the idea of Riddick being promoted to oxygen-breathing human. 
JOHNS (to Fry) Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all -- 
FRY 60 years ago. 
JOHNS Wha'? 
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY 
The sand-cat reaches the crash ship. Bodies leap off. Paris steals a look at... 
The rising planet. It threatens to blot out suns, sky, universe. 
INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY 
Johns yanks the first power cell and starts dragging it over the deck. Riddick yanks a second cell and, carrying it on his shoulder, passes Johns with a suck-my-ass grin. Johns shoulders his cell and stumbles after. 
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY 
Shazza wheels the sand-cat around, getting clearance between it and the ship. 
The Chrislams lash a scrap-metal sled to the sand-cat. 
Riddick drops the first cell onto the sled, Johns the second. They're racing the eclipse and each other. 
EXT. SKY - DAY TO DUSK 
As the rings of the planet eclipse the yellow sun. 
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DUSK 
It's like God just closed a blind: Daylight dims. The change in light brings a GROWING HIGH-PITCHED SOUND. 
FRY Don't stop, don't stop.... 
But Paris can't help himself. He squints to see... 
EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DUSK 
The spires. THE SOUND seems to come from there. 
EXT. SKY - DUSK 
As the rings eclipse the red sun. 
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK 
A second darkness sweeps over the survivors. Now they all stop, beholding... 
EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK 
Something pouring from the spire-tops. Backlit by coronal light, it first seems to be smoke or ash -- but soon we realize these are living things, HATCHLINGS SQUEALING IN DELIGHT over their first nightfall. 
EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK 
JOHNS Jesus, how many can there.... 
They keep coming, filling the sky with thick waves. Mercifully, the hatchlings seem to be moving away. But now one wave cleaves from another -- and does a quick about-face. 
PARIS Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee. 
FRY Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo. 
They run. Reach the cargo hold. Turn back to see... 
Riddick and Shazza still coming. Hearing the SQUEALING WAVE descending on them... 
Riddick and Shazza hit to the dirt. Hatchlings torrent just inches overhead. 
CLOSE on Shazza. Horrified. Hard to breathe. Like being underwater. 
CLOSE on Riddick. He watches in awe, no more frightened that a kid lying on his back looking up at the stars. Experimenting, he eases a bone-shiv into the hatchlings. Instantly it's whittled down to nothing. It's like a river of razor blades. 
The hatchling keep coming. Shazza whips a panicky look at the cargo hold. Can she make it? Should she even try? 
AUDREY Tell her to stay there. Stay down. SHAZZA, JUST STAY DOWN! 
Shazza starts worming toward the cargo hold. Suddenly the hatchings vanish. A beat. Is it safe? Shazza gets to her feet... 
FRY No, no, NO, NO, NO.... 
...and the wave is back, enveloping Shazza. 
INT./EXT. CARGO HOLD - DEEP DUSK 
Now she challenges him to be the mind-reader. 
JOHNS (CONT'D) Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane. 
FRY (to others) We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock. 
PARIS I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night. 
FRY We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes. 
Troubled faces. Is it just our imagination? Or is the light on the floor growing dimmer? 
AUDREY You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there? 
PARIS Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot. 
JOHNS Back it up. How long can this last? Few minutes? Couple hours? 
No one knows for sure. 
IMAM I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness. 
JOHNS Those suns gotta come back sometime. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then. 
FRY I'm sure that's what someone else said. Locked inside that coring room. 
A persuasive thought. Eyes swing back to Audrey. 
JOHNS Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there? 
FRY Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen. 
JOHNS Smoke screen for what? 
FRY For your own fear. 
JOHNS (eyes narrowing) Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE? 
Two seconds pass. 
FRY How much you weigh, Johns? 
JOHNS What the hell's it matter? 
FRY How much? 
JOHNS 79 kilos. 
FRY Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and that's why you can't come up with a better plan. 
He makes a move for her. Riddick blocks. Johns' shotgun bumps the underside of Riddick's chin. 
RIDDICK Think about that reward, Johns. 
JOHNS I'm willing to take a cut in pay. 
RIDDICK How 'bout a cut in your gut? 
Johns looks down. CAMERA DROPS to reveal the shiv Riddick holds, poised for evisceration. 
JOHNS Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this. 
IMAM Please...this solves nothing...please.... 
Johns backs off first. The light grows dimmer. 
FRY (to Audrey) They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them. 
IMAM And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark? 
FRY No, I'm not. But he can. 
She's pointing, of course, to Riddick. 
EXT. PLANET - NIGHT 
The eclipsing planet dominates half the sky. In whatever coronal light remains, we see clouds forming. 
RIDDICK (shaking head) Had it with deals. 
FRY But I just wanted to say -- 
RIDDICK Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better. 
It worries Fry. "If he doesn't expect to go free...." 
RIDDICK (CONT'D) Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there. 
FRY We can, can't we? Trust you? 
RIDDICK Actually... (completely genuine) That's what I been askin' myself. 
He walks away. HOLD on Fry -- wondering if she hasn't made a terrible, terrible mistake. 
EXT. NIGHT 
The drag-sled begins moving. 
SERIES OF TRACKING SHOTS: Riddick running point, goggles off, eyes flashing. Johns and Imam pulling the drag-sled like malamutes, handlights sweeping. Pilgrims #1 at the first side- guard position, Fry and Audrey at the second, each position carrying an umbrella torch, FIREBALLS BLAZING. Paris stumbling along at rear-point, sweeping the cutter back and forth, every shadow a threat. They are a train of light. 
CLOSE on the sled. Holding four power cells and eight bottles of booze. 
CLOSE on Fry. Looking down. Noting sand-cat tracks underfoot. 
EXT. NIGHT 
Below us run the survivors. CRANE UP AND AWAY so that their lights become insignificant...so that we include, in FOREGROUND, the silhouettes of gliding predators. They're following from above, awaiting their chance. 
EXT. NIGHT 
FRY'S POV: Of the ground. The sand-cat tracks have vanished. 
JOHNS So you noticed too? 
FRY Riddick. Riddick. 
The procession grinds to a halt. Everyone sucks hard on breathers as they muster inside the light. 
FRY Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them? 
RIDDICK Saw something I didn't like. 
JOHNS Such as. 
RIDDICK Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you? 
Paris looks over his shoulder. "We went around what?" Nearby CLICKING breaks up the confrontation. 
FRY Let's move. (to Audrey) Just a detour. He'll get us there. 
PARIS Can we switch? 
FRY What, switch what? 
PARIS I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can.... (off their stares) Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here -- 
JOHNS She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells. 
PARIS Oh, so I'm disposable? 
FRY I'll switch, I'll switch! Christ, just get this train moving! 
EXT. NIGHT 
They trundle on, Fry the new tail-gunner. 
At side guard, Paris relaxes a bit -- even though the CLICKING never seems far from earshot. A weak FIREBALL SPEWS from his torch. He checks the reservoir. Almost empty. 
PARIS Light, please, need light here.... 
Still moving, Johns and Imam train lights on Paris while he refuels. For a brief moment, Audrey strays from the light. 
PREDATOR'S POV: Dive-bombing the girl. 
A HIGH-VELOCITY CLICKING: It's like an incoming missile. Imam lunges at the last nanosecond... 
Imagine a hundred Geiger-counters next to a truckload of plutonium. That's the SOUND that rides the wind now. 
RIDDICK Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think. 
FRY Think about what? 
JOHNS About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick! 
RIDDICK (answering Fry) About the girl. 
FRY What about her? 
RIDDICK What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding. 
JOHNS What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut. 
RIDDICK (agreeing) No. She's not. 
It hits Fry like a two-by-four. She looks at Audrey. 
AUDREY (confessing) I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything.... 
FRY No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner. 
JOHNS (finally getting it) Aw, this can't be happening to me.... 
RIDDICK They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood. 
IMAM Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between -- 
RIDDICK (scanning) There is no "safe." 
An epic beat. The wind gusts...the FLAMES CHATTER...their ears fill with CANYON SOUNDS. 
FRY It's not gonna work. We gotta go back. 
Johns brays. 
JOHNS Hey, you're the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a whipped dog? 
FRY I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship. 
JOHNS I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here. 
FRY Are you fucking high again? Just listen to -- 
JOHNS No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get -- 
IMAM She's the captain, we should listen to -- 
JOHNS Listen to her? Her? When she was willing to sacrifice us all? 
A beat. Eyes turn to Fry. She wants to protest -- but can't. 
AUDREY What's he talkin' about? 
JOHNS During the crash, she -- 
FRY (a warning growl) This does not help us, Johns. 
JOHNS -- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us -- 
FRY Just shut up, okay? 
JOHNS -- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we are disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her. 
FRY Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE! 
She rushes him, ready to rip his eyes out. He shunts her aside. 
JOHNS We're not alive because of her -- we're alive in spite of her. 
He swung below the belt -- and connected. Fry's chin quakes, her knees fail. The undertow of events finally pulls her down. 
FRY We cannot go through there.... 
JOHNS (lording) How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh? 
RIDDICK What, you 'spect me to do it? 
JOHNS What's one more to you? Like this is the one that sends you to Hell? 
RIDDICK Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you. 
EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT 
As Fry and the others keep slowing. 
EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT 
JOHNS Awright. You do the girl, I'll keep the others off your back. 
Riddick stops. Reconsiders. 
JOHNS (CONT'D) Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples. 
RIDDICK (shakes head) Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum. 
JOHNS Like who, Mr. Chrislam? 
EXTREMELY TIGHT on both men: In their eyes, we see the new partnership splintering apart: "Like Mr. Johns." 
Riddick makes a play for the shotgun. It BLASTS skyward. 
EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT 
As the fight erupts: 
FRY Bring the light! 
AUDREY What're they doing? What're we -- 
FRY Leave the sled, let's go, go, go! 
EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT 
FIGHT SCENE: Johns' light hits the ground, creating an arena of illumination. FAST CLICKING nearby. Still struggling, Riddick and Johns somehow manage to gang-aim the shotgun and BLAST THE CLICKING AWAY. 
The shotgun goes free. Johns lunges for it, but Riddick kicks it into the night. And then pulls his shiv. 
RIDDICK Gotta stay in the light, Johns. That's the only rule. 
Johns circles inside the light. Fucking with him, Riddick starts poking and jabbing, backing him up against the wail of dark. Johns stumbles over something. A bone. A club. 
Riddick finds his own bone-club, and now they go at it like two cavemen. Riddick beats on Johns' club-hand, breaking fingers, forcing him to drop the bone. Just trying to get away now, Johns makes a desperate lunge for the light, but... 
Riddick shivs open his back. 
RIDDICK Remember that moment? 
Gushing blood, Johns starts crawling pathetically with the light. Riddick dogs him. 
RIDDICK Shoulda never took the chains off, Johns. You were one brave fuck, before. Now look at you. Oh, yeah, you were Billy Bad-ass with your gauge...with your chains.... 
Johns finds the shotgun. "And I'm still Billy Bad-ass." He sweeps it around with the light, ready to kill... 
Blackness. Where'd Riddick go? 
CLICKING behind Johns. He whirls to see... 
Something big coming for him. Johns BLASTS IT back into the night, dropping the light as he does. Eyes in the back of his head, he whirls again and takes aim on... 
Another bull-rushing predator. 
Johns triggers a bad round. Crazed, he ratchets and levels the shotgun for another try. He's too late. 
BIG CLOSEUP as the ejected shell rolls to a stop. It's red. Johns loaded a morphine shell in the dark. 
RIDDICK'S POV: With Johns skewered by the armpits, the predator lifts him off the ground and "stares" with a deceptively gentle CLICKING-COOING SOUND. 
PREDATOR'S POV: Of Johns' final expression. 
RIDDICK'S POV: The predator rears back its head -- then slams forward, hitting Johns with the full force of its skull-blade, splitting him in two. 
EXT. NIGHT 
EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
The torches. Maxed out. Burning non-stop. 
Fry and Imam. Sled chains on. Lapping up O2. Each holding a torch. 
Pilgrim #1. Clutching a handlight. 
Audrey. Rolling under her sled-shield, becoming the turtle in a metal carapace. 
Riddick. Goggles on. He has no desire to see what horrors will surround them. There's just one path, anyway: Straight through. 
RIDDICK As fast as you can. 
FRY You sure you can keep -- 
RIDDICK As fast as you can. 
EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
SLEW OF SHOTS: Fry and Imam on the move, dragging the shield fast. Audrey speed-crawling beneath. Pilgrim #1 tripping along behind the shield. And Riddick behind them all, face already tortured, pulling 200 pounds of stubborn-mule cargo -- yet somehow keeping pace. The torch flames, stretched by the wind, flank them in fire. 
EXT. CANYON RIM - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
As predators launch from the rim. 
EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
First come the hatchlings, streaming right into their faces -- then veering away at the last second, repulsed by light. Next come FERAL SOUNDS overhead. 
RIDDICK Don't look. 
Thin blue liquid spatters them. 
RIDDICK Do not look up. 
More spattering. Fry looks up -- and stumbles when she beholds... 
A ceiling of predators. At the cusp of light, they dive and weave and dart, slashing each other in a rabid desire to SOUND OUT the humans below. It's like looking into a bucket of angry eels. 
RIDDICK Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going! 
His voice whips them like the Devil's coxswain. Chastened, Fry keeps her eyes down and speed up. 
More blue blood showers down -- followed by entrails dropping out of the sky. Could this be Hell itself? 
IMAM (a muttered mantra) "So dark the clouds around my way I cannot see, But through the darkness I believe God leadeth me. I gladly place my hand in His when all is dim, And, closing my weary eyes, lean hard on him...." 
Now WHOLE CORPSES ARE CRASHING DOWN around them, victims of in-fighting. Fry and Imam start slaloming through the ghastly mess. 
Pilgrim #1 passes too close to a corpse: A blade slices his leg, drawing blood. He keeps his mouth shut. 
EXT. CHOKE-POINT - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
The passage narrows into a choke-point. Fry sees it first. 
FRY Riddick? RIDDICK? 
Ahead, a clot of dead predators blocks the canyon. 
AUDREY What? What is it? 
RIDDICK It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT! 
Steeling themselves, they start climbing. 
But Audrey, on all fours, has to discover the corpses with her hands. Then, taking exception at being walked on... 
One "corpse" snaps at her. Audrey recoils sideways... 
And tumbles down the mound of corpses. She's exposed. 
PREDATORS' POV: Rapid-fire images of Audrey. Flashes from 10 different predators. 
FRY Audrey! 
Audrey shakes out of it and scrambles for the shield just as... 
He's found a crevice in the canyon wall. 
RIDDICK Inside...inside.... 
EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
They crawl into the fissure. The second torch dies behind them. 
EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
There's just one light left now -- the one Riddick wears on his back. By its glow, we watch him lift the shield, muscle it over to the crevice... 
EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
...and slide it over the opening. A black beat. 
AUDREY (a beat) Why's he still out there? 
Fry's not sure. Is he protecting them? Or entombing them? 
EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
Working like Sisyphus, Riddick hauls the cells up a muddy rise. He stops at the top, peers through the rain. 
RIDDICK'S POV: Of the settlement. 
Riddick disappears over the rise. The four cells follow, slithering through the mud like a serpent's tail. 
EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
AUDREY He's not coming back, is he? 
Fry checks Imam's face. Did Riddick say anything to you?" Imam wags his head. A bleak beat -- before Fry realizes she can see his face. 
FRY There's light in here. 
It's a soft glow from above. Imam climbs higher to discover small blue-white lights clinging to rocks. He plucks a few. 
FRY What are they? 
CLOSE on the lights in Imam's palm. They writhe with life. 
IMAM Larva.... 
AUDREY Glow worms.... 
FRY (mind racing) How many bottles we got? Empty ones? 
INT. SKIFF - NIGHT 
Riddick boards the dark craft. 
Connects the power cells to the battery bay. 
Watches the ship come to life. 
EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
CLOSE on a liquor bottle. It's half full of glow-worms. 
AUDREY More, more, we need more.... 
They climb higher. Little by little, the bottle brightens their world. 
EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT 
Drenched in light, Riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff, looking out into dark rain. Is he struggling with a decision? Or just savoring the safe harbor? Then very deliberately... 
Riddick smashes his handlight on the hull. He steps inside and closes the hatch behind him. 
EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
Something claws its way up the rise. Standing, we see that it's Fry, a bottle of glow-worms strung around her neck. Ahead she spies... 
The settlement. Silhouetted by engine-light. 
EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT 
RIDDICK Just give me your hand. 
FRY But they...they could still be.... 
RIDDICK No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn. 
A beat. She takes his hand -- and jerks him down the gangway. They sprawl through mud. She gets a knee on his neck. 
FRY I will not give up on them! I Will not leave anyone on this rock with those fucking things, even if it means -- 
In a blur, Riddick rolls and slaps a shiv on her neck. Is history repeating itself? Riddick's face, though, is strangely calm. Curious. Even gentle. 
RIDDICK You'd die for them? 
FRY I would try for them. 
RIDDICK You barely know them. 
FRY But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I do feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them. 
EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
MORE SCRABBLING at the shield. Imam cocks his blade back, ready to do battle with... 
Fry. She heaves the shield aside. Behind her, Riddick. 
AUDREY (big-eyed) You came for us.... 
RIDDICK Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this? 
EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
Protected by the meager light of two glow-worm bottles, the four remaining survivors head out. 
RIDDICK Tighter, tighter.... 
EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT 
RIDDICK Stop. 
They pile up awkwardly. Fry listens hard. Only RAINFALL. 
FRY I don't hear -- 
He covers her mouth. 
RIDDICK'S POV: Water has pooled at the base of the muddy rise. A predator drinks there. 
RIDDICK (on his breath) Doesn't see us...wait for it to leave.... 
RIDDICK'S POV: Another predator lands to drink. Then another. Their backs are to us, but the pool is turning into a major gathering place. 
Soon they all can hear CLICKING above the RAIN. Their nightmare is far from over. 
RIDDICK Get behind me. 
RIDDICK'S POV: Of a half-dozen predators shifting places at the pool. A slim gap appears. 
RIDDICK When I go, we go. Full-throttle. 
CLOSE on their hands, gripping each other. 
RIDDICK Ready...ready.... 
RIDDICK'S POV: The gap between predators widens into a passage. A gauntlet within a gauntlet. 
Riddick runs. Linked like paper dolls, the others follow blindly. 
RIDDICK'S POV: Of a predator turning to "stare" over its shoulder. 
PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick bearing down fast. 
The survivors hit the water like lawn mowers on legs, crashing through, scattering water and predators alike, managing to reach... 
The muddy rise. Audrey loses her grip on the others... 
And starts back-sliding. She CRIES OUT, turning the head of...

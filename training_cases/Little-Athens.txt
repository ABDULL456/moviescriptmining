FADE IN: 
INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MORNING 
The room is dark and messy. JERRY, a soft, unshaven boy of about eighteen years, sits on the end of his bed in boxers and an old t- shirt. He has not quite woken up yet. 
Jerry pulls a huge, well-traveled SUITCASE from his closet and tosses it onto the bed. He begins grabbing articles of CLOTHING from the closet and tossing them into the Suitcase. 
INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER 
Jerry is in his kitchen, which is no brighter than his bedroom, and not much cleaner. Jerry takes another bite of his peanut butter and jelly SANDWICH. He chews mechanically, washing it down with a can of SODA. His lazy mind is somewhere else. 
INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
Jerry gargles with a generic brand of MOUTHWASH and spits into the sink. 
He catches a glimpse of himself in the medicine cabinet mirror - he is not very attractive. He grabs his TOOTHBRUSH and RAZOR, and exits the bathroom. 
INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
The room has been stripped except for the bed minus its bedsheets, a naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a small TV on top of it, an old POGO STICK propped against the wall near the GARBAGE CAN at the foot of the bed, and a few posters and scraps of trash. Jerry tosses his Toothbrush and Razor into his Suitcase next to a VIDEO GAME CONSOLE and several VIDEO GAMES, on top of which lies GRAND THEFT AUTO III. He has pitifully few belongings. He shuts the Suitcase. 
INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
The living room is also a mess - the place is either a pig sty or a house full of bachelors. Jerry, now in sweatpants and sneakers, but still wearing the same t-shirt that he slept in, carries his Suitcase through the foyer to the front door. He about-faces to look at the interior of his home. He will not miss it. 
He turns to open the screen door - it's stuck. He fiddles with handle until the screen door opens. He exits, letting the screen door slam shut behind him. 
TITLE CARD: 
Little Athens 
EXT. RESCUE SQUAD -- MORNING 
The old building is badly in need of a fresh paint job.   A faded sign reading "ATHENS RESCUE SQUAD" stands in front. 
HEATHER (O.S.) You hear about your ex? 
ALLISON (O.S.) Jerry? 
INT. RESCUE SQUAD, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS 
The kitchen is empty except for HEATHER and ALLISON, both about nineteen and dressed in EMS uniforms with "EMS" stitched conspicuously on the back, seated on opposite sides of a wooden table. Heather is dark-haired, about 5'9" and built like a lingerie model. Allison has blond hair, is several inches shorter than Heather, and although not overweight, she has a softer build than Heather. Heather has take-out PANCAKES and SAUSAGES in front of her, and she is putting it away like she is preparing for famine. Allison has a BAGEL and a PEACH, which remain hardly touched - she has a lot on her mind. 
HEATHER Yeah, asshole Jerry. He's moving to Middletown. He left this morning. 
ALLISON No way.   How do you know? 
HEATHER Carter said. He got some job at some company, giving his uncle hand-jobs. 
Having put away the last of her food, Heather lights a CIGARETTE and stands near the open window, careful to blow the smoke out the window. 
ALLISON Doesn't sound so bad. 
HEATHER I got us tickets to see Adam tomorrow. 
ALLISON I don't want to go to a baseball game. You're going with Derek anyway. 
HEATHER Ally, I don't want to go either, but Derek told Adam he'd go, and I'm not going by myself. 
ALLISON I thought Adam was hurt. 
HEATHER I wish. 
Heather takes a drag of her Cigarette and exhales out the window. 
EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT -- MORNING 
BRAD, in jeans with his t-shirt thrown over his shoulder, is standing in front of the door, waiting. MEGAN, in shorts, a t-shirt and a baseball cap, and AMY, in a sunskirt, look on. All in their late teens, they are unmade and worn-out, as if they hadn't slept last night. 
Brad rings the doorbell twice and waits some more. Brad walks over to the window a few feet over from the door, trying to peer through the shades. Megan passes the time by pulling Jimmy's MAIL out of the mailbox that hangs next to the door. 
BRAD (banging on the window pane) Hey! Jimmy! 
The door opens and JIMMY answers, in his very late teens, about 5'4" and thin, dressed in boxers, a t-shirt and bedroom slippers. Jimmy's tired, but Brad's a friendly face. 
BRAD (CONT'D) Finally! 
JIMMY Office hours are nine to five. 
MEGAN You have a lot of credit card bills in there, Jimmy. 
JIMMY (holding his hand out for the Mail) I know. 
Megan hands Jimmy the Mail. 
INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
JINA, Jessica's mother, opens the front door and enters the living room wearing a grocery checkout clerk's uniform. Jina drops her old, worn out purse onto the coffee table and enters the hallway. She opens the bathroom door and enters. 
INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
Jessica is brushing her teeth when Jina enters. 
JINA Aren't you supposed to be watching Katie right now? 
Jina reaches around Jessica and opens the medicine cabinet, grabs a bottle of ASPIRIN, and shuts it. Jessica continues brushing as if her mother were not there. 
JINA (CONT'D) Did you get my message? 
Jessica shakes her head in the negative sense. Jina exits the bathroom and Jessica follows, still brushing her teeth. 
INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
Jessica walks over to the ANSWERING MACHINE and hits a button. The Answering Machine clicks on as Jessica brushes unenthusiastically. 
ANSWERING MACHINE (electronic voice) You have one new message. (Jina's voice) Hi Jess, it's your mother, calling to say happy birthday, since you'll be gone when I get home. I'm driving your sister to school and I'm leaving the car for her, so I'll be taking the train back. 
Jessica starts up as if she'd been struck. She spins around to an open window near the couch, leans out, and spits out the toothpaste 
to the concrete sidewalk below. Her mother's voice continues to pour forth from the Answering Machine. 
ANSWERING MACHINE (CONT'D) By the way, you should call your sister and stop this not-talking nonsense. 
Jessica finishes spitting the suds from her mouth and spins back towards the Answering Machine. 
ANSWERING MACHINE (CONT'D) Anyway, I know how you hate long messages, so I'll see you tomorrow... 
Suddenly wide awake, Jessica turns to her mother. 
JESSICA That's fucking bullshit. 
JINA Here we go again. 
JESSICA What about my car?! 
JINA Jessica, your sister got into beauty school, and she's going. Now I've got about two hours sleep before I have to drive her all the way the hell up there. 
JESSICA Yeah, I heard that. 
JINA Jess, you're still living here for free. 
JESSICA On the couch! 
JINA Jessica, it's still my car, and she needs it. Can't you be happy for your sister? 
JESSICA Oh yeah, I'm real happy. She gets my car, and I get shit. Thanks, Jina. Do me a favor and tell her how fucking happy I am for her. 
JINA If you're going to be like this, I'm just going to bed. 
Jessica storms back into the bathroom and rinses her mouth out with water. 
Jessica returns to the living room wearing a t-shirt that reads "Athens Youth Group" in large letters along the front. Jina is gone. Jessica runs her hand through her hair, tossing it haphazardly. She grabs a pair of large SUNGLASSES off of the coffee table and places them over her eyes. 
She opens the door and exits the apartment. 
EXT. RON'S GYM -- MORNING 
Jimmy's PIECE-OF-SHIT hatchback is parked in front of the small bare-bones gym. 
INT. RON'S GYM, LOCKER ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
Jimmy now dressed in worn-out heavily-frayed khaki shorts and a short-sleeve button down shirt with a "Ron's Gym" emblem on the pocket, stands before his locker twisting the combination lock with one hand while rotating steel CHINESE STRESS BALLS with his other hand. He opens the locker and pulls out a large brown LUNCH BAG propped prominently at the base. 
RON (O.S.) Hey Jimmy.   You fix the lat machine? 
RON, the tall, well-built, forty-something owner of the gym, approaches. Jimmy turns toward Ron. The row of lockers serves as a backdrop. 
JIMMY Yeah. 
RON Jimmy, I'm just gonna say this, alright? I gotta let you go. I can't afford two employees. 
JIMMY So you're keeping Melinda? 
RON Yeah. 
JIMMY Ron, that is totally fucked!   I been here way longer than her! 
RON Yeah, but I'm running a business. There're guys who pay me dues just 'cause she works here. 
JIMMY But she doesn't do anything! She just sits at the front desk all day. 
RON I know that. 
JIMMY Tell her to fix the fucking lat machine, she'll look at you cross-eyed. 
RON I can't afford two employees, and she attracts business. That's it. 
JIMMY Fucking great. Thanks. 
KATIE But it's okay to drink. 
JESSICA When you're older it'll be okay. 
KATIE How old are you? 
JESSICA Old enough. 
KATIE But you're not twenty-one yet. The law says you have to be twenty-one. 
JESSICA Katie, can you not ask so many questions today? I've got too much to think about. 
KATIE Cause it's your birthday? 
JESSICA Yes. 
KATIE Happy Birthday! 
JESSICA Thank you. 
Jessica begins walking faster, soon breaking into a crippled run, the weight of Katie bearing down on her. They reach their destination - a rickety old merry-go-round. Jessica turns her back to the merry-go-round, allowing Katie to step onto it. 
JESSICA (CONT'D) Hold on tight or you'll get hurt. 
KATIE I will. 
Katie grabs a handle as Jessica begins to spin the machine. Katie sails around happily as Jessica steps back to watch, Katie's youthful enthusiasm lulling Jessica into a nostalgic gloom. 
INT. AMBULANCE -- MORNING 
HEATHER is driving the AMBULANCE, sirens blaring, a CIGARETTE hanging out of her mouth, with ALLISON riding shotgun. HARRY, mild- mannered, rotund, middle-aged and slightly balding, is in the back sitting on a bench extending from the side of the ambulance, adjacent to a stretcher. Harry sits expressionless, adjusting his spectacles as the ambulance shakes mildly from the driving. 
ALLISON (pointing) Turn left at the light. 
EXT. ROAD -- CONTINUOUS 
WIDE on the ambulance tearing through town, lights flashing. Heather is driving extremely fast in this emergency situation, recklessly passing both moving vehicles as well as stationary vehicles that have stopped to let the ambulance pass, on her way to running through a red light. In the rear of the ambulance, Harry whips back and forth on the bench, yet remains calm, as if unaware of Heather's reckless driving. 
EXT. POOL, PARKING LOT -- CONTINUOUS 
Within the parking lot, the ambulance comes to a screeching halt in front of a large picket fence encircling the pool. At the gate stands the LIFEGUARD. 
All three climb out of the ambulance.    Harry rushes toward the Lifeguard. Heather takes a final puff    of her Cigarette and flicks it aside before continuing in the same   direction as Harry. Allison lags behind, pulling a BACKBOARD and a   large FIRST AID KIT out of the ambulance. 
LIFEGUARD She's in here. 
They enter the gate. 
EXT. POOL -- CONTINUOUS 
Heather and Harry follow the Lifeguard into the pool area, where several BYSTANDERS have gathered around the VICTIM, BYSTANDER #1 and PETE among them. Heather gets to the Victim first, but stops short - she recognizes the Victim. Harry brushes past Heather. 
HARRY (to Bystanders) Can you give us some room, please? 
The crowd backs up a bit, and Harry checks for vitals. 
HARRY (CONT'D) (looking up to Heather) She's breathing. 
Harry looks the Victim over a bit. 
HARRY (CONT'D) (to Lifeguard) What happened? 
LIFEGUARD I'm not sure. She just passed out, right where you see her. 
HARRY Did you see her eat anything? 
LIFEGUARD Uh-uh. 
Heather turns and walks back toward Allison coming through the gate carrying the Backboard and First Aid Kit - she wants a word with Allison. They talk in hushed tones. 
HEATHER I know her. 
ALLISON Yeah?    How? 
Allison hands Heather the First Aid Kit as they move back toward Harry. 
HEATHER When I was dating Steve, that slut fucked him. 
ALLISON How do you know? 
HEATHER She started dating Steve right after we broke up. I mean right after. I asked him if there was another girl, and he never answered. He couldn't answer, because he was fucking that slut. 
ALLISON That doesn't mean they fucked. 
Heather gives Allison a disapproving look, as if to say "don't be stupid, stupid." 
As Heather and Allison approach the Victim, Harry looks up. 
HARRY Alright, she ain't comin' around. 
Allison lays the Backboard adjacent to the Victim, and the three place her on the Backboard. Heather is a bit rough. 
HARRY (CONT'D) (instinctively) Whoa, easy. 
CARLOS Jess, you just passed me!        In my car! 
Carlos continues to look as his Car makes a right turn and disappears from view. 
CARLOS (CONT'D) Jess, this is bullshit! Bring back my car! 
A horn honks, and Carlos steps toward the side of the road as a STATION WAGON passes right by him. He continues to stand in the street, although to the side. 
CARLOS (CONT'D) Jess, I know you're coming back here. I know you're not leaving me standing here. 
Carlos waits impatiently. Jessica pulls up in the Car and comes to a stop alongside him - she had gone around the block to pick him up. He gets in the passenger-side door. 
JESSICA Sorry. 
The Car pulls away. 
INT. CARLOS' CAR -- CONTINUOUS 
Carlos has a look of disgust on his face. 
JESSICA I would have brought the car back, but I need it. 
CARLOS So you ask. 
JESSICA I said I'm sorry. 
CARLOS Yeah right. And why the hell are you still driving? 
JESSICA Fine. 
The Car stops, Carlos and Jessica climb out of the Car and pass in back of it without a word. Carlos climbs into the driver seat, and Jessica the passenger seat. Jessica grabs Carlos's Nachos and starts munching them down, dipping each one into the CHEESE SAUCE that is on the side. 
CARLOS Where's the squirt? 
JESSICA At my place watching TV. 
CARLOS You left her alone? 
JESSICA Just for a minute. I left my novel at Aaron's. 
CARLOS You need it now? Aren't you supposed to be watching her? 
JESSICA Yeah, I'm stuck with her all weekend. I'm just gonna get through these last few weeks like I promised, and I'm done, I did a good thing, and some other moron can take a turn being her big sister. 
CARLOS Don't know why you wanted another sister when you hate the one you got. 
Jessica needs to change the subject. 
JESSICA What're you up to? 
CARLOS Guess who stopped by. 
JESSICA Who? 
CARLOS Guess. 
JESSICA Mary Lynn. 
CARLOS Yes.     Gigantic beast of a woman that she is. 
Jessica is obviously delighting in this. She enjoys Carlos fighting off the affections of this very unattractive girl. 
JESSICA Aw Carlos, I think you should give her a shot. She's probably one of those personality girls. 
CARLOS Yeah, what you know about personality? 
JESSICA I bet she'll give it up right away. 
CARLOS Now that's something you know about. 
JESSICA You should go for it.   Drain them pipes. 
CARLOS Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. 
Carlos reaches down and blasts the radio as the Car speeds down the road. 
EXT. PIZZA SHOP -- MORNING 
Jimmy is carrying several full insulated pizza CARRYING BAGS, with several brown LUNCH BAGS full of food on top. Although the pile looks unwieldy, Jimmy has no trouble with it. He places the pile on the roof of his PIECE-OF-SHIT, opens the passenger door, and places the pile on the passenger seat. 
He closes the door, and pulls a DELIVERY LIST out of his pocket to examine while walking around to the driver's side. Jimmy gets into the driver's seat and pulls out his CELL PHONE. 
JIMMY (into his cell phone) Hey, Car, it's me. I got a delivery in the area so I'm stopping by a little early. See you in a little while. 
Jimmy hangs up, starts his Piece-of-Shit, and pulls out of the parking lot. 
EXT. COUNTY ROAD -- MORNING 
A POLICE CAR is sitting off the road, positioned to surprise unsuspecting speeders. The lone occupant, DEREK, twenty, about 6' tall with athletic build, in his police-officer uniform, is reading the SPORTS SECTION of a newspaper. 
INT. DEREK'S POLICE CAR -- CONTINUOUS 
OTS on Derek as he turns the page and continues reading the sports section. A young preppy high school PUNK speeds by in a CORVETTE - the RADAR GUN reads 93 m.p.h. As he passes, the punk looks straight at Derek, mouth open, clearly surprised by Derek's presence. Derek picks up his head and returns the stare of the surprised Punk as he passes. 
Jessica throws the Nachos on the coffee table and sits on the couch, head in her hands, on the verge of tears. 
JESSICA Shit, shit... 
PITT Yeah, you did it. 
JESSICA Fuck you, Pitt. 
INT. POOL, MEN'S BATHROOM -- MORNING 
COREY is MOPPING the floor. He glances up as Pedro steps over to him. Corey and Pedro talk and argue like two kids on a playground. 
PEDRO Hey, mehn. 
COREY What're you doing back? 
PEDRO I got your sister. (forming breasts with his hands) She got big. 
COREY That's my little sister. 
PEDRO She's hot, mehn. Esta buenisima. 
COREY Just take her back to our place! 
PEDRO I can't because we got no place.   We got thrown out. 
COREY He threw us out?! 
PEDRO Si! And all our shit's still in there! And Pancho, too! 
COREY That's illegal, isn't it?!   He can't just lock us out! 
PEDRO Si, he sucks cock. I mean, I gotta go find a job, I smell like shit, I'm fucked! 
COREY Maybe you should talk to your boss.    Like, ask him to take you back. 
PEDRO No, fuck him, mehn! Just gimme Mr. Cocksucker's address. 
COREY What for? 
PEDRO I take care of this. 
COREY Don't do anything that'll get us into trouble. 
PEDRO Do you think I'm stupid, mehn? Don't worry about this. I talk to him. But first I take care of business. 
Pedro bangs on a stall door, with no response.    Pedro pushes the door to the stall open. 
PEDRO (CONT'D) Okay, mehn.     Good. Voy a cagar. 
Pedro disappears behind the door of the stall.    Corey leans his Mop against the wall and exits. 
EXT. CAR'S HOUSE -- DAY 
JIMMY pulls his PIECE-OF-SHIT into the driveway of what appears to be a one-story house, next to a RANGE ROVER. He climbs out with the strap of his BACKPACK hanging over one shoulder and walks around the house to the back yard. 
The yard slopes significantly from the front yard to the back yard, and the view of the back of the house reveals two stories. As Jimmy turns the corner, he spots a black CAT walking up to him. He grabs the Cat. 
INT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 
WIDE on Jimmy holding the Cat behind a set of sliding glass doors, one door partially open. He enters and shuts the door behind him. Music is playing through stereo speakers, and a black-and-white movie is playing on the TV with the sound shut off. CAR, an Asian- American late-twenty-something, is sitting back on the couch facing 
the TV. Magazines, junk food, remote controls and a CORDLESS PHONE are spread out on the coffee table. If Car notices Jimmy enter the room, he shows no sign of it. 
JIMMY Saw your cat outside. 
Jimmy tosses the Cat on the floor, and it scurries off to another part of the house. Jimmy sits in a recliner beside the couch, glad to take a load off. Jimmy takes a peak at the TV. 
JIMMY (CONT'D) I gotta get back to work. I got more pies in the car. 
No response. The Cordless Phone starts ringing.    Car remains perfectly still. 
JIMMY (CONT'D) Car? 
No response.   The Cordless Phone continues to ring. 
Jimmy leans over from his chair and waves a hand in front of Car. Nothing. Jimmy jumps up from his recliner. He stares at Car. He steps over, takes two fingers and checks Car's pulse. He stands back, unsure of what to do. 
Hesitant, Jimmy walks over to a closet, opens the door, and slides a GYM BAG out into the room. He opens the Gym Bag and pulls out a large bag of MARIJUANA and a few jars of K. He throws them into his Backpack, zips up the Gym Bag, and puts it back into the closet. 
Jimmy exits through the sliding glass doors. 
EXT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 
Jimmy shuts the doors behind him. He stops in his tracks just outside the doors, thoughts running through his mind. 
INT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 
WIDE on Jimmy through the doors as he about faces and stares into the house. He slides the doors open and re-enters. 
He picks up the Gym Bag and carries it to the front of the couch. He sets down Gym Bag and drops to his knees, all while noticing that Car appears to be staring at him. He unloads the remaining contents of the Gym Bag into his Backpack, including a few bags of PILLS, a few more jars of K, and two large bags of WHITE POWDER. 
He throws one strap of his Backpack over his shoulder and stands in front of Car. Jimmy stares at Car. 
JIMMY That's retarded. 
The Female Passenger begins to slowly stir.    It is clear she is out of it - still very woozy. 
DAVE See?   I told ya. 
JIMMY Dave, you're a sick fuck.   I'm calling 911. Look at the blood! 
Jimmy reaches for his Cell Phone, but Dave again objects. 
DAVE Put that shit away. I'll take her home and give her some K, she'll be fine. 
JIMMY She needs a doctor.   What the hell's K gonna do? 
DAVE Jimmy, listen, she's gonna be fine. A guy like you should be avoidin' that kinda' attention. 
JIMMY You should take better care of your girl. 
DAVE Bro, she ain't my girl. She plows through all my drugs, and I fuck her like a goddam whore. She's a whore. 
FEMALE PASSENGER (O.S.) Fuck you, Dave, you asshole! 
DAVE See, she's fine. 
Dave lights a CIGARETTE. 
JIMMY Holy shit. You're fucked up. (seeing an opportunity) Hey, you need any juice or anythin'? 
DAVE No, man, I'm good. 
JIMMY You sure? Look, man, I just got a buncha' stuff. Coke, e, K. I gotta sell it fast, you can sell it to your crackhead friends whenever. 
DAVE You been placin' bets with Bobby the Bookie again? 
JIMMY No. I'm just, I'm payin', like, twenty percent on my cards and shit, and it drives me fuckin' nuts, pissin' all my money away. 
DAVE Sellin' drugs ta pay off the plastic, huh? 
JIMMY You want it? 
DAVE Look, I'm definitely interested in a little bit for myself, definitely, but I ain't no dealer like you. Lemme think about it. 
JIMMY Hey, your nose is bleedin'. 
Dave reflexively puts a finger to his nostril and examines it for blood. 
DAVE Seriously? 
JIMMY No, just horsin' around. 
DAVE Listen, I gotta get going.    Patch her head up and shit. 
JIMMY Yeah. (regarding Dave's Car) Sorry, man. 
DAVE Don't even sweat it, man, I told ya. 
Jimmy and Dave get in their respective cars and drive off. 
EXT. POOL, SWINGS -- DAY 
EMILY is seated on a swing off to the side of the gated pool area, smoking a CIGARETTE, looking in through the gate at the pool. She's wearing an old, yet barely worn, BASEBALL CAP. 
COREY (O.S.) You smoke?! 
EMILY Yeah, so?     You do drugs. 
Corey enters the frame, grabs the Cigarette and stomps it out, but Emily's nonchalant demeanor remains. 
COREY How would you know? 
EMILY Everybody knows my brother does drugs. 
COREY So you heard about that thing that happened? 
EMILY Yeah.   Everybody knows about that, too. 
COREY If you think so highly of me, what the hell are you doing here? 
EMILY I'm just saying. Why'd you try to put everything back in the house? 
COREY We ran outta of gas. We were right outside his house - what the hell else were we supposed to do? He wasn't supposed to be home for another hour. At least he took it easy on us. 
EMILY (changing the subject) Here, I brought this. 
Emily hands Corey the Baseball Cap.     Corey is caught off-guard. 
COREY What for? 
EMILY Dad gave it to you, remember?     You left it. I brought it for you. 
COREY Keep it.     I don't wear hats. 
EMILY I don't want it. 
Jimmy opens his trunk and pulls his BACKPACK out. 
JIMMY (CONT'D) Where's my Grand Theft Auto? 
MATT I lent it to Jerry. 
JIMMY What'd you do that for?    Get it back. 
MATT He moved down the shore.    This morning. 
Rushed, Jimmy blows it off and pulls a jar of K out of his Backpack. 
JIMMY Alright, sixty bucks. 
MATT What?   Fer one freakin' jar?! 
JIMMY Dude, stop your bitchin' and pay up.      I told you this shit, I told you. 
MATT You said extra, I thought you meant, like, fifty! 
JIMMY Asshole, fifty is the regular fuckin' price! 
MATT This is fuckin' extortion! Knowin' I'm meetin' this chick, so you jack up the price! 
JIMMY Look! This is a pain in my ass, comin' way out here, and I said I'd charge you extra. I don't give a shit if its ten over the regular price, or twenty-five over your fuckin' "discount price," but you're payin' sixty bucks for this jar. 
MATT (weakly) Man, what the hell. (looks in his Wallet) I need some cash for food and drinks, man! I'm takin' this girl out! 
JIMMY (considering) Gimme fifty even. 
MATT C'mon, man! I need as much cash as I can get! What if she wants to go somewhere?! And gas! Dude, just take forty-five! 
JIMMY (breaking) Fine, you cheap-ass fuckin' bastard. 
Jimmy accepts the Forty-Five Dollars, and gives Matt the jar of K. Jimmy is pissed. 
JIMMY (CONT'D) Here, man, go fuckin' get high. 
MATT (almost apologetic) See ya. 
Jimmy throws his Backpack back in the trunk and slams it shut. 
EXT. POOL, CLUBHOUSE -- DAY 
COREY is on a PAYPHONE outside the restrooms, talking to PEDRO. 
PEDRO'S VOICE He said "no," mehn. The cocksucker won't let us back in. 
EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE -- CONTINUOUS 
Pedro is on a PAYPHONE.   We cut back and forth between Pedro and Corey. 
COREY That's great. 
PEDRO Hey, this isn't my fault, mehn. 
A short beat as Corey thinks. 
PEDRO (CONT'D) Hello? 
Corey hangs up and puts more coins into the Payphone.   Pete approaches, looking for Corey. 
PETE Corey. 
Corey tries to phase out Pete's voice. 
PETE (CONT'D) The Blandinos just called again.   The broken glass is still there. 
ROB'S VOICE (via the Payphone) Hello? 
PETE And the grass needs to be cut. 
COREY (hurriedly to Pete) Okay, I'll take care of it. 
PETE (sarcastic) Don't forget to put gas in it. 
Pete exits. 
COREY Rob?     It's Corey Becker. 
ROB'S VOICE Hey. 
COREY You got any spare cash? 
EXT. POOL -- MOMENTS LATER 
EMILY is laying back in a lounge chair. Corey enters the pool area from clubhouse carrying the BASEBALL CAP. He walks over to his MOPED chained to the gate, throws on his Baseball Cap, unlocks his Moped, and pushes it through the gate where resident KIDS are gathered around a ping pong table. Emily watches as he hops on the Moped and throws on his HELMET. KID #1, one of the younger kids at the table, spot Corey in the distance. 
KID #1 Corey!     Hey Corey! 
Corey looks over as he starts his Moped. 
KID #1 (CONT'D) Gorski says he can beat you! 
JIMMY No.     Nobody answered the door. 
KWON Well, you want to come by now? I'll be here. You can make your pick-up. 
JIMMY Can't do it now. I'm delivering on the other side of town. 
KWON Deliveries? Jimmy, fuck the pizza.     Stop by and get your shit. 
JIMMY I can't.   What's the big deal? 
Jimmy, very anxious, runs a red light.    A CAR going the other way stops and honks. 
KWON Jimmy, my cousin's dead, and there's a shitload 'a shit missing from our house. 
JIMMY Car? 
KWON What do you think? 
JIMMY I don't know. 
The TRAFFIC in front of Jimmy slows, and Jimmy coasts to a standstill at the tail of the traffic and in the middle of a busy intersection. 
KWON I want you to come over here and tell me everything that happened when you stopped by. 
JIMMY Nothing happened, Kwon.   I knocked and no one answered. 
KWON You didn't ring the doorbell? 
Jimmy's light turns yellow while he is still at a standstill in the middle of the intersection. 
JIMMY That's what I meant. 
KWON And no one answered. 
JIMMY No.     No one answered. 
KWON You left a message on our house phone this morning. Why didn't you call our cells when you got here? 
Jimmy's light turns red, and he is still at a standstill in the middle of the intersection. A CAR at the head of the cross traffic inches up to Jimmy's Piece-of-Shit and honks, but Jimmy does not seem to notice. 
JIMMY (stumped) Why didn't I call.     Good question. 
KWON What the fuck do I care, you think it's a good question?! Are you fucking kidding me?! 
JIMMY Look, I didn't think of it.    I got a lotta shit on my mind right now. 
KWON Jimmy, do you have my drugs? 
JIMMY No. 
The cross traffic honking grows louder, even though there is nowhere for Jimmy to go. 
KWON Alright.     If you hear anything, you call me. 
JIMMY I will.     Sorry about Car. 
KWON Thanks, Jimmy. 
Jimmy hangs up. 
EXT. INTERSECTION -- CONTINUOUS 
Cars are still honking at Jimmy as he continues to sit at a standstill in the intersection. 
JIMMY (generally to the other drivers) Fuck off! 
Jimmy throws his Piece-of-Shit in reverse, then cuts left, through and out of the intersection. 
EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT -- DAY 
JIMMY parallel parks his PIECE-OF-SHIT in front of his apartment and exits carrying his BACKPACK. He unlocks the door to his apartment, opens it, and steps one foot inside. 
INT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS 
Jimmy slides the Backpack into his apartment. TIGHT on the backpack as it slides across the hardwood floor, straight towards the camera, to a halt immediately in front of the camera. Jimmy steps back outside and shuts the door. 
EXT. ROB'S HOUSE -- DAY 
COREY is standing in the middle of an unkept lawn, watching ROB, about eighteen and wearing Corey's HELMET, ride Corey's MOPED in circles around him on the lawn. He's treating the Moped rather roughly, pulling wheelies and kicking the tail end out repeatedly. Corey is watching impatiently, holding the BASEBALL CAP at his side. 
Rob jumps the Moped over the curb into the street, then turns up the driveway and pulls up alongside Corey. Rob removes the Helmet. 
ROB I'll take it. 
INT. AARON'S HOUSE -- DAY 
AARON returns from the kitchen drinking from a can of SODA. TROY and PITT are on the couch, VIDEO GAME CONTROLLERS in their hands, waiting for the VIDEO GAME to load. Troy is lighting a CIGARETTE. 
AARON (to Troy) C'mon, let's go find her. 
TROY I'm not gonna go scouring the countryside lookin' fer her. 
AARON Gimme yer keys. 
ALLISON You must think so. You tried to set me up with him. 
DEREK I thought it was a bad match.     It was Heather's idea. 
ALLISON So she thinks I can't do better. 
DEREK You know what she thinks better than me. 
Allison climbs out of bed, and her mood changes from thoughtful to business-like. She begins putting her CLOTHES on. 
ALLISON Let's get dressed, she'll be here. 
Derek looks calmly over at the ALARM CLOCK on the nightstand. 
DEREK Let's let her walk in on us, and look surprised. 
ALLISON Hurry up. 
Allison opens the door and walks out, a little bow-legged. 
INT. PIZZA SHOP -- DAY 
JIMMY walks through the front door. PIZZA POP spots him immediately from behind the counter. The PHONE rings, but Pizza Pop ignores it. 
PIZZA POP Hey-a Jimmy.    Where you been? 
JIMMY Around.     Deliverin'. 
PIZZA POP Hurry - sit down Anna eat something.       We got more deliveries for you. 
Jimmy walks around the counter, grabs a couple of SLICES and throws them in the oven. Pizza Pop picks up the Phone. 
PIZZA POP (CONT'D) (into the Phone) Poppy's! 
INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- DAY 
The door bursts open and JESSICA enters, followed by CARLOS.   KATIE is watching TV. 
JESSICA Did your parents call? 
KATIE Nope!    Where were you? 
JESSICA Out with Carlos. 
Jessica disappears into the kitchen. 
KATIE The VCR is broken. 
INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS 
Jessica tosses a FROZEN DINNER into the microwave. 
JESSICA (yelling to Carlos in the living room) 'Los, are you hungry?! 
CARLOS (O.S.) I guess. 
INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
Jessica places two Frozen Dinners, complete with a FORK apiece, down on the coffee table. Katie grabs her Fork. 
KATIE Are we going to have TV dinners all weekend? 
JESSICA No.     I promise. You want some milk? 
KATIE Can I have ice-tea? 
JESSICA Of course. (to Carlos) Can you make her some ice-tea? 
CARLOS Aren't you gonna eat? 
JESSICA I'm gonna take a shower. 
Carlos is disappointed that Jessica wants to fix herself up to see Carter. Katie is already eating. 
INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
We're behind JESSICA as she removes her SHORTS and her SHIRT. 
INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
Katie now has a glass of ICE-TEA in front of her.    Carlos is behind the TV and VCR, fiddling with the wires. 
KATIE Are you Jessica's new boyfriend? 
CARLOS No. 
KATIE I wish you were. I don't like Aaron. 
CARLOS Neither do I. 
KATIE Don't you like Jessica? 
CARLOS Kind of, I guess. She's nice. 
Jimmy is sitting in an alley behind the pizza shop, finishing a COKE with plenty of ice. Kwon emerges from the back door of the pizza shop. Jimmy sees Kwon, and hides his displeasure as best he can. 
KWON Hey, Jimmy. 
JIMMY What's up. 
KWON I'm just looking for my stuff.   Let's take a ride. 
JIMMY Where? 
KWON Your place. 
JIMMY Can't do it 'til after work. 
KWON You're sitting here on your ass! 
JIMMY I gotta eat. I'm going back to work now. My boss needs me - I'm the only delivery guy. 
KWON Is that your piece-of-shit out front? 
JIMMY Yeah. 
KWON Let's check that out. 
JIMMY I told you, I ain't got your shit. 
KWON Hey! Until I find the drugs, everyone is a suspect! 
Jimmy's Cell Phone rings. 
KWON (CONT'D) (regarding the call) Fuck that. Let's look in your car. 
Jimmy reaches into his pocket, but instead of a cell phone, he pulls out his car KEYS, which he tosses at Kwon. Kwon storms off, and Jimmy grabs his CELL PHONE out of his other pocket and answers it. 
JIMMY Hey, it's Jimmy. 
INT. DAVE'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS 
Dave is standing in front of finishing up blending a PROTEIN DRINK, holding a CORDLESS PHONE to his ear. Cut back and forth between Jimmy and Dave. 
DAVE Hey man, it's Dave.   I got happy news for you. 
JIMMY You want the juice? 
DAVE I told ya, I got plenty. But about the other stuff, I been thinkin' 'bout your problem, and I know a guy who could help you out. Buy a lot a' your shit all at once. 
JIMMY The juice? 
DAVE No, no. I'm talkin' 'bout the coke an' shit. I might know somebody. 
JIMMY (lowering his voice in case Kwon comes back) Who? 
DAVE This spear-chucker from Manville. Sold me some fake D-ball once. I tied his brother's dog to my front bumper and we talked it out. Turned out to be an okay guy. I gave him a call and he's definitely lookin'. 
JIMMY For how much? 
Dave, having walked into the living room, takes a seat on the couch next to the FEMALE PASSENGER we saw earlier, her head now bandaged. She is snorting a line of COKE off of the coffee table. 
DAVE Well, he's pretty small time, but he's itchin' to move up a few notches. 
JIMMY He's got money? 
DAVE He talks so much shit it's hard to tell. You need to talk to him. 
Jimmy considers, then pulls a PEN and his DELIVERY LIST out of his pocket. He turns the Delivery List over to write on the back. 
JIMMY Gimme his number, man. 
EXT. PIZZA SHOP -- CONTINUOUS 
The doors of Jimmy's PIECE-OF-SHIT are flung wide open.    Kwon is hauling Jimmy's spare TIRE out of the trunk. 
JIMMY Kwon, what the hell are you doing? 
Kwon dumps the Tire on the ground and, seeing nowhere to hide anything, stands straight up and looks at Jimmy. 
KWON When you off work? 
JIMMY Don't know.     Maybe nine or nine-thirty. 
Kwon tosses Jimmy his KEYS back, jumps in his BMW, and takes off. Jimmy becomes increasingly resolved as he watches him leave. Jimmy pulls out his Delivery List and his Cell Phone. He turns the Delivery List over to the number on the back and punches it into his Cell Phone. He paces as he talks. 
SINJIN'S VOICE Hello? 
JIMMY Is this Sinjin? 
SINJIN'S VOICE Yeah, who's this? 
JIMMY This is Jimmy. Juicehead Dave's friend. 
SINJIN'S VOICE Yeah, I know. 
EXT. POOL -- DAY 
HEATHER (busting Carter's chops with a mocking tone) What's up. 
As Heather passes, Carter mockingly shows Heather the back of his hand as if to smack her. Heather and Allison pass, and Carter holds the door open with his foot as he looks for something to prop it open. 
INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS 
From the inside we can see that Carter's house is the same house that Jerry moved out of this morning - Jerry was Carter's housemate. Heather and Allison walk in as if they know their way around. Carter spots a large clay LAWN DWARF on the back porch. He reaches for it. 
CARTER Stay outta my room. 
Heather holds out the vodka. 
HEATHER Wanna shot? 
CARTER Later.   I wanna see how crazy it gets. 
HEATHER Skirt. 
Carter props the screen door open with the Lawn Dwarf. 
EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- EVENING 
PEDRO, EMILY and COREY, now wearing the BASEBALL CAP, are parked in the TOW TRUCK across the street from the front of Carter's house. Porno magazines lie on the dashboard and the floor. BERUBI, walking along the side of the house from the back yard, spots Pedro behind the wheel. He approaches. 
EMILY (to Corey, disapproving) I can't believe you're doing this. 
COREY (aside to Pedro) Ya think it's a good idea we leave it out here on the street like this? 
PEDRO (aside to Corey) Forget about that, mehn. (referring to Berubi) 
I'll talk to Berubi. I know what to say to this guy. Don't worry. 
BERUBI Hey, Pedro, what's up with the Mustang? 
Berubi motions to the MUSTANG hitched to the back of it. 
PEDRO Que?    Ah, el Mustang? 
Pedro starts to climb out of the Tow Truck. 
BERUBI Yeah. 
PEDRO Nada.    I'm doing a favor for a friend. 
BERUBI So you're driving around with his car hitched to your tow truck? 
Pedro shuts the door to his Tow Truck and pulls up his shorts. 
PEDRO Bueno, he's a good friend. 
BERUBI Sounds good.    Come on an' grab a beer. 
PEDRO (to Berubi) Hey, listen, can I sleep on your couch? 
BERUBI Kimmock's got couch. 
PEDRO Come on, mehn, we're in trouble here.      We got thrown out of our home. 
BERUBI You got evicted? 
PEDRO Si. I went out to get a gallon of milk for my dog, I come back, my keys don't work, and the cocksucker put an eviction notice on the door. He didn't even tell us! Now my milk's spoiling in my truck, Pancho's probably pissing all over the place, I'm fucked. 
BERUBI Hey, listen, if you want, you can crash in Jerry's room. He moved out. 
PEDRO He did? 
BERUBI Don't park there. Park in back. 
PEDRO Si, si.     No problem, mehn. 
BERUBI (to Corey) What's up, Becker. 
Corey sticks his hand up to say hello. 
INT. CARLOS' CAR -- CONTINUOUS 
Carlos's CAR is parked in street in front of Carter's house, just down the street from where Pedro has parked, but on the opposite side of the street and facing in the opposite direction. Through the windshield, we see Berubi head back toward the house as Pedro glances at Jessica, now showered and dressed in a yellow tank-top, before climbing back into the Tow Truck and pulling back out onto the road. Carlos has noticed Pedro, but Jessica, silent as she stares at the house, has not. 
Finally, Carlos speaks up. 
CARLOS Did you know he was having a party? 
Jessica grabs the rear view mirror and aims it toward herself.   She begins fixing her hair in the mirror. 
She pulls her LIPSTICK out of her PURSE and begins to apply it as Carlos watches. She puts her Lipstick away and stares at Carter's house another moment. She checks to see that her SUNGLASSES are still hanging on the front of her shirt. 
JESSICA Let's go. 
EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- CONTINUOUS 
Jessica climbs out of the car and shuts the door. Carlos follows suit. They move around the side of the house toward the back porch. Jessica stops in her tracks and turns to face Carlos. 
JESSICA Wait here a second and let me talk to him. 
JESSICA Look, don't even get into the cheating thing, 'cause you're seein' Rachel still. Don't call me the slut. 
CARTER Look, I'm not gettin' into it with you. I'm through with that bullshit. 
JESSICA Fine. Just, I need your help with Aaron. Just help me this one last time, that's it. 
CARTER He's probably gonna be here tonight, Aaron. 
JESSICA You're kidding. You barely even know who he is! 
CARTER No, but I know Troy real good. He said he'd be bringin' him. I ain't got nothin' against Aaron, so I said "what the hell." 
JESSICA Look, can you just kick his ass for me? Please? 
CARTER Shit, Jess, I don't wanna be fightin' no friend 'a Troy's. Can't you just work this shit out? 
JESSICA Carter, he hit me! And sprayed me with pepper spray! 
CARTER What the hell. 
Carter contemplates, and Jessica realizes that the best thing to do is keep silent and let Carter's good side take over. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Look, if he tries anything tonight, I'll do something. 
JESSICA What'll you do? 
CARTER Whadda you mean what'll I do?! (facetious) I'm gonna dance with him! Fuckin' I'll beat his ass! I don't wanna, but if he shows up tonight and makes like he's gonna hit you, I'll beat his ass. 
JESSICA What if he doesn't come? 
CARTER Troy said he was bringin' him. If he doesn't, call him or somethin'. But I'm not a fuckin' bounty hunter whose gonna chase Aaron across the goddam country. 
Jessica is not completely satisfied, but Carter has decided what he's going to do, and that's that. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Alright? 
JESSICA Alright, fine. 
CARTER You're welcome. 
Carter exits, leaving the door open, but Jessica doesn't follow. 
EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT 
JIMMY has parked his PIECE-OF-SHIT in the rear of the back yard behind all of the other CARS that have pulled in. He climbs out, slides his CHINESE STRESS BALLS into his pocket, and walks toward the house, his BACKPACK strapped over both shoulders like a schoolboy. 
INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER 
Jimmy steps through the open screen door into the kitchen. 
HEATHER (O.S.) Hey, there he is! Jimmy! 
HEATHER and ALLISON are playing CARDS at the kitchen table with a male PARTYGOER. They jump up from the table and approach Jimmy. 
Jimmy pulls three small bags of MARIJUANA out of his BACKPACK. Allison pulls out some BILLS. 
JIMMY Thirty bucks. 
ALLISON (counting Bills) I only got ten. 
JIMMY I don't believe this shit. 
ALLISON (finishing counting) Nine. 
JIMMY You got nine! Jesus Christ!      You knew what you asked for! 
HEATHER Jimmy, relax. My God. 
JIMMY No, this is fuckin' ridiculous. What'd you call me for? I ain't runnin' a goddam soup kitchen here. 
HEATHER (mock seductive) Can't you just take care of us for tonight? 
JIMMY Yes, for thirty bucks. 
ALLISON Here then, take nine for one. 
JIMMY It's ten. 
HEATHER You know what? You need to get laid, Jimmy. Maybe you'd relax a little. 
JIMMY Fine.     Enjoy your night. 
Jimmy as he stuffs the Marijuana back in his Backpack and heads into the hallway. 
HEATHER Well I'm not going to drop to my knees for a lousy dimebag, so fuck him. 
INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BATHROOM -- NIGHT 
The door is shut.    JESSICA is talking on her CELL PHONE. 
JESSICA (trying to muster a sweet voice) What are you doing? 
KATIE'S VOICE Watching TV. 
CARLOS Is he gonna help? 
JESSICA He said he would. 
Carlos pulls a pint of WHISKEY out of his back pocket. 
CARLOS Look.   Wanna shot? 
Jessica accepts the Whiskey and takes a long pull. She holds onto the Whiskey without saying anything, and Carlos does not object. She begins to take in the sights and sounds of the party, and notices COREY leaning against a rusty old washing machine near the KEG as PEDRO hands him another BEER. 
Jessica's POV as Corey spots her standing next to Carlos. He continues to stare at Jessica, clearly taken by the sight of her, his eyes locking onto hers. The desperation of their individual struggles is lost for a moment. 
PEDRO You want me to talk to her? 
The moment quickly passes as Corey turns his attention back to Pedro. 
COREY No. 
PEDRO Si. So let's go fix the tire on the Mustang. 
Corey attention is again drawn to the ping pong game, and Jessica takes note. 
CARLOS (to Jessica) You wanna play? 
Carlos motions toward the large kitchen window.   Jessica turns to look through it. 
INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS 
Jessica and Carlos are staring through the window at the CARD game taking place at the kitchen table. HEATHER and ALLISON are back at it with the male PARTYGOER they were playing with earlier, as well as CARD PLAYER, who has recently joined them. Heather is smoking a CIGARETTE. Card Player is dealing a round of asshole. All are visibly drunk. 
HEATHER (examining her Cards) What's dickhead doing? I knew he was lying. 
Jessica turns toward the steps leading out onto the back yard, and Carlos follows. Heather and Card Player each place one card face- down on the table, exchanging one for the other. 
HEATHER (CONT'D) (to Card Player) This is your best card? 
CARD PLAYER I ain't happy about it. 
HEATHER Shut up and drink, asshole. (to Allison) I should call him. 
Card Player obeys and drinks. 
ALLISON He said he'll be here. 
HEATHER He's probably got that Tess on all fours, fucking the shit out of her like the skank she is. (thinking about it) No, you're right, fuck him. (throwing three fours down on the table face- up) Drink. Fucking everyone drink. 
All obey Heather. 
INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
We recognize the room as Jerry's old bedroom, empty except for a bed stripped of it's sheets, a naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a small TV on top of it, and a few posters and scraps of trash that have been left behind. JIMMY and RJ are looking across the room at SINJIN, a young African-American male about RJ's age, with an average build, sharply dressed in a button-down, and sport coat. Sinjin has his back to Jimmy, and is bouncing up and down on a rusty old POGO STICK - his behavior constituting a sharp contrast to his stylish threads. LOUIE, an overweight, slobbish Caucasian male a few years older than Sinjin, sits in a rickety old WHEELCHAIR that might creak even more than Sinjin's pogo stick - in Louie's lap rests a BOWLING BALL BAG. Upon seeing Sinjin and Louie, Jimmy fondles his WATER BOTTLE nervously. He turns around to watch RJ closing the door behind them. 
LOUIE Sinjin! 
Sinjin spins on the Pogo Stick and spots RJ and Jimmy standing at the entrance. Sinjin loses his balance and places a foot on the ground. He steps off the Pogo Stick and composes himself after his exhaustive venture. 
SINJIN Mr. Pizzaman! What's up? (referring to Jimmy's BACKPACK) Got any calzones in there? 
Sinjin tosses the Pogo Stick aside. 
SINJIN (CONT'D) (re the Pogo Stick) It's harder than it looks. 
Sinjin turns the GARBAGE CAN over and sits on it while motioning to the bed. 
SINJIN (CONT'D) (comfortably, to Jimmy) Sit down, man, sit down. 
RJ walks over to lock the door as Jimmy inches closer into the room. 
RJ Yo, door don't lock. 
SINJIN Well you got to stand your big muthafuckin' ass outside then, 'cause ain't nobody comin' in here. 
Everybody looks at RJ. 
RJ I don't give a shit. 
RJ steps out and shuts the door behind him. 
SINJIN Alright.     Jimmy, sit down, sit down. 
Jimmy is clearly uncomfortable at the sight of these two. 
JIMMY I like to stand usually. 
SINJIN Alright. I'm Sinjin.      That legless waste is Louie. 
LOUIE I got legs little Massey muthafucka. 
JIMMY (to Sinjin) I thought it was gonna be just me an' you. 
SINJIN It is. Don't be worryin' Louie - he's just here to have a good time. 
EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT 
Drunk Partygoer hangs up and turns over to a couple of other Partygoers. 
DRUNK PARTYGOER (CONT'D) (to Partygoers) Cops are comin'! I'm tellin' Carter. 
The other Partygoers are not impressed - they continue to sit and drink. Drunk Partygoer loses focus and rejoins them. 
EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT 
COREY and MITCH barter over the Mustang, though Mitch seems more interested in his BEER than the car. PEDRO is putting the last touches on putting on the NEW TIRE. He picks the FLAT TIRE up and tosses it in the trunk. 
COREY It's a good car. 
MITCH It's alright. I'd have to ask Jeremy. What do you want for it? 
COREY Make an offer. 
MITCH Twelve hundred. 
COREY Twelve hundred! That's nothing! 
MITCH Look, there's a lotta shit that Jeremy's gotta do with it. It's not like he can just switch the fuckin' plates and it's a go. 
PEDRO Coño, we got thrown outta our apartment! We need more money! 
MITCH Steal some more cars.   I'll see what I can do. 
Mitch polishes off his Beer and holds the empty cup up. 
MITCH (CONT'D) You want another? 
EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT 
AARON and TROY step out onto the back porch and spot JESSICA and CARLOS. Upon seeing them, Carlos stands straight up. 
CARLOS Aaron's here. 
Jessica, still pacing, stops in her tracks and turns around beside Carlos. It's too late to gracefully exit, so Carlos stands there frozen. Jessica does not seem afraid. 
Aaron and Troy approach.    It's clear Troy doesn't really want to be there. 
AARON (to Carlos) Hey guy. 
CARLOS Hey. 
AARON You like talking to my girl? 
CARLOS Aaron, I didn't mean nothin'. 
AARON No?     Just friends? 
CARLOS Yeah. 
AARON What's the matter, don't like her that way? 
Carlos painfully does not answer. Jessica, unfazed, takes another hit of WHISKEY. Jessica is confident because of the booze and because of Carter's promise. Jessica and Aaron begin arguing in calm "I'm above this" mannerisms. 
AARON (CONT'D) (to Carlos) Go 'head, take her home. Fuck 'er brains out. She'll give you a little surprise. 
Carlos simply stands there, ashamed of his inability to act. 
JESSICA Fuck you, I'm clean. You're the cheatin' asshole with bumps on your cock. 
AARON (to Troy) Hold this. 
Aaron hands his beer to Troy and then grabs the Whiskey Jessica is holding. Jessica flinches as if afraid Aaron would hit her. 
AARON (CONT'D) Better wipe this off good. You never know. 
Aaron uses his shirt to vigorously rub the mouth of the bottle before taking a long pull. The Whiskey is almost gone. Jessica grabs back the Whiskey, wipes it off as Aaron did, and polishes it off. 
AARON (CONT'D) You're good at that. You ready yet to go bang some dude? Maybe Carlos here? 
JESSICA Fuck you. I'm going to get Carter, and he's gonna kick your ass. 
AARON Carter ain't gonna kick shit. 
JESSICA We'll see, right? 
Jessica moves to leave, but Aaron grabs her arm. 
AARON Hold on a minute ... 
Jessica smashes the bottle over Aaron's head, knocking Aaron to the floor in a daze. 
JESSICA That's for the pepper spray, asshole! 
The PARTYGOERS in the back yard are now fixed on Jessica and Aaron. CARTER runs over, holding his CIGAR and a BEER. BERUBI is behind Carter, eager for a fight. 
CARTER What's goin' on? 
TROY She smashed a whiskey bottle over his head. 
JESSICA He grabbed me! I'm not gonna sit and wait until he hits me again! He can just keep his fuckin' hands off me! 
HEATHER I don't mean it! You're my best friend! My sister! I love you so much! 
ALLISON No, maybe you shouldn't.     Maybe I don't deserve it! 
HEATHER You deserve it! You're so perfect! 
ALLISON Don't say that! I'm not, I'm not! 
HEATHER Yes you are! 
WIDE on Heather and Allison. The noise of the party drowns out their conversation. Allison is whispering forcefully into Heather's ear. Heather is listening, but cannot hear. We see her lips form the word "what?" Allison continues whispering, and Heather's face becomes furious. She pushes Allison back. 
HEATHER (CONT'D) You fucking slut! 
Heather shoves Allison hard off the couch. As Allison stumbles roughly and attempts to recover, PARTYGOERS, mostly guys, gather around, cheering wildly. Heather kicks furiously at Allison, who is on all fours employing the turtle defense. We catch a glimpse of Allison's face - she is in utter panic. Heather's foot catches Allison square in the face, knocking her limp. 
Most of the crowd has stopped cheering. Heather continues to kick at Allison's limp body, and two SKINNY GUYS pull Heather away. Heather shakes them off and leaves in a huff, while everyone is tending to Allison. 
INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, HALLWAY -- MOMENT'S LATER 
HEATHER, visibly psychotic, and still very drunk, is making a beeline straight for RJ, who shows no sign of noticing Heather until she is directly in front of him. 
HEATHER (pointing to Berubi's bedroom) Wanna take me in there and fuck my brains out? 
RJ Sure, I don't give a shit. 
HEATHER Fucking great, let's go. 
Heather heads towards Berubi's bedroom, and RJ follows, passing JIMMY and BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES. Jimmy looks back at RJ as he passes. 
INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
Jimmy reenters the room he retreated from earlier, with Bobby in tow. The room is empty. 
BOBBY What the fuck Jimmy? 
JIMMY Just hold on. 
Jimmy steps further into the room and stands pensive as Bobby takes a seat. Bobby lights up a CIGARETTE. 
BOBBY I can't figure you Jimmy. 
SINJIN (O.S.) Where the fuck is RJ? 
The door bursts open again with a violent thrash, and LOUIE fires into view on his WHEELCHAIR with SINJIN pushing from behind. 
LOUIE Take it easy you stupid motherfucker! 
Sinjin kicks the door shut with the back of his foot and wheels Louie into the room. Louie is holding a half-full bottle of JACK DANIELS in his hand, the BOWLING BALL BAG still in his lap. 
SINJIN This your partner? 
JIMMY Where you been? 
SINJIN Just gettin' a drink, Jimmy.     You took long enough. 
Sinjin wheels Louie in a haphazard, indirect arc somehow closing on the center of the room. The doorknob rattles. 
SINJIN (CONT'D) (to Louie) Thought that shit didn't lock. 
Sinjin is staring at the door, but Louie is pre-occuppied. 
LOUIE (to Bobby) You're Buggerin' Bobby Bales. 
BOBBY Excuse me you cripple motherfucker? 
LOUIE Buggerin' Bobby Bales.     Sayeed knows you. 
BOBBY Call me that again. 
Louie takes a strong pull from the bottle of Jack. 
SINJIN Louie, shut the fuck up.     Let's just do this. 
LOUIE Call you what again?     What everyone calls you? 
BOBBY Yeah.   Call me that. 
LOUIE Buggerin' Bobby Bales. 
Bobby stands, tosses his Cigarette aside, and marches toward Louie. Sinjin knowingly looses his grip on the Wheelchair and steps back. 
SINJIN Bobby, let's relax now.   Louie may be a fool... 
Bobby grabs Louie by the collar and throws him from the Wheelchair. Louis lands heavily on his crippled frame, dazed, the Bowling Ball Bag dribbling onto the floor near Sinjin. Bobby grabs the Wheelchair in both hands and begins smashing it against the wall and into the floor. 
As Jimmy and Sinjin watch, dumbfounded, the large clay LAWN DWARF we saw earlier bursts trough the window and lands in the center of the room. Everyone stops to stare at the Lawn Dwarf, including Bobby. 
EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT 
JESSICA storms through the yard toward Carlos' CAR.   CARLOS is right behind. 
JESSICA Where'd we park? 
JESSICA Thank you. 
EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT 
EMILY, her back up against a tree, continues making out with an aggressive MALE PARTYGOER 1. As MALE PARTYGOER 1 comes up for air, we see that he has a hand down Emily's pants, fingering her. Emily's mind is somewhere else. 
Emily snaps back to reality and removes Male Partygoer 1's hand and pushes him away from her - she won't become another slut in a town full of them. 
MALE PARTYGOER 1 Hey, what's wrong? 
Emily makes for the front door and into the house. 
EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT 
MITCH has refilled his BEER and patiently waits for a counteroffer from COREY. 
COREY How about two thousand even? 
Impatient with the proceedings, PEDRO walks over to the passenger door of the Mustang, swings it open, and leans inside, struggling a bit. 
MITCH Can't do it. 
COREY Why not? 
MITCH It's not economically... (searching for the word) Good, right, sound, whatever. 
Pedro reappears from the backseat, holding an expensive STEREO. 
PEDRO Okay, give us two thousand and I give you this nice stereo for free. 
MITCH Where the hell you get that? 
COREY Yeah, what the hell is that?! 
PEDRO (to Mitch) It was in the car. 
MITCH I don't want a stereo. 
PEDRO You can have it for free, mehn. 
MITCH Where's the speakers? 
PEDRO In the back. 
Corey walks over, opens the door and looks in the back.   His gaze falls upon an item on the floor in the back seat area. 
PEDRO (CONT'D) (O.S.) This stereo's a motherfucker, mehn, I'm telling you. I was gonna keep it myself. 
Corey pulls out from the back seat of the Mustang holding a large red and blue POLICE LIGHT. He is dumbfounded. Corey looks to Pedro for an explanation. 
PEDRO (CONT'D) What's that? 
COREY I thought you'd tell me! 
MITCH It looks like police cherries. 
COREY It can't be. 
MITCH Look fellas, I'd like to help you out, but I'm not into buying stolen cop cars. It don't seem right somehow. 
Corey and Pedro struggle for an explanation, but are left speechless. 
EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT 
JESSICA and AARON are leaning against a random partygoer's CAR. They look very calm. 
JESSICA I didn't cheat. 
AARON Fine, you say so, fine. 
JESSICA That's it? 
AARON Well what the hell can I do? There's nothin'. I got your goddam initials tattoo'd next to my balls. 
JESSICA It was a stupid thing to do. 
AARON You don't like it?! 
JESSICA Well of course I like it!       But what if we break up? 
AARON Yeah, I thought about that.    I'll say it's for Jesus H. Christ. 
JESSICA Great. Then you could start going to church. 
Two POLICE CARS pull onto the lawn to break up the party, both cars flashing their red and blue lights. TROY approaches Jessica and Aaron. 
TROY Cops're here. I'm goin'. 
AARON (to Jessica) You need a lift? 
JESSICA Okay. 
INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS 
SINJIN Alright everybody calm the fuck down! This shit's gettin' outta hand- 
BANG! Everybody freezes as the sound and smoke of a gunshot lingers, then checks to make sure they weren't hit. As doorknob starts rattling with increasing intensity, everyone checks to make sure they weren't hit, then turns to the source of the gunshot. Louie is holding the Gun as he lays on his side, having scrambled to grab the Gun. 
The door bursts open - it's RJ, out of breath. 
EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS 
POLICE OFFICER 1 is using one hand to hold onto PEDRO, still HANDCUFFED, by his upper arm, and the other hand to unlock and open the rear driver side door of his POLICE CAR. POLICE OFFICER 2 watches as he keeps hold of COREY by his HANDCUFFS. 
POLICE OFFICER 2 (to Police Officer 1) Holy shit, you hear that? 
The two officers hasten their actions. Police Officer 1 lowers Pedro into the Police Car, then moves to the front seat of the vehicle and grabs the C.B. 
POLICE OFFICER 1 This is Unit one five seven. Shot fired at 15 Saddlebrook. Repeat, shot fired at 15 Saddlebrook. Request backup immediately. 
INT. POLICE CAR -- CONTINUOUS 
Police Officer 2 shoves Corey into the POLICE CAR next to Pedro. Corey and Pedro sit in the rear of the police car, and Police Officer 2 slams the door. Through the windshield we see Police 
Officer 2 run toward the house as he draws his PISTOL.   He moves up the porch past... 
EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH -- NIGHT 
DEREK walks up the steps onto the back porch as PARTYGOERS move out of the house away from the sound of the gunshot. He notices POLICE OFFICER 2 behind him. 
DEREK You call that in? 
POLICE OFFICER 2 (moving up the porch and into the house) We should get everybody out of the house. 
HEATHER (O.S.) (friendly) Derek? 
Derek and Police Officer 2 turn to see HEATHER walking onto the back porch from the kitchen. 
DEREK Heather, go home. This is gonna get- 
Heather interrupts Derek's statement with a swift, unexpected knee to Derek's groin. Derek doubles over, and Heather grabs him by the hair. 
POLICE OFFICER 2 Hey! 
Police Officer 2 shoves Heather to the ground, grabs Derek's HANDCUFFS, and cuffs her hands behind her. Derek is still stunned from the assault. 
POLICE OFFICER 2 (CONT'D) Derek, you alright? 
ALLISON, who had been standing back watching the assault, approaches Heather, who is getting up onto her knees. Allison gets on her knees and hugs Heather, who cannot hug back because of the handcuffs. Allison is bawling. 
ALLISON I'm so sorry, Heather, I'm so sorry. 
Heather is shutting her eyes extremely tightly, struggling not to cry. She does not attempt to pull away from Allison's tight embrace. 
INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
SINJIN marches straight toward LOUIE, who wears the pathetic look of a child about to be disciplined. 
SINJIN Louie!   What the fuck are you shootin' at? 
LOUIE (pointing at BOBBY) Him! 
BOBBY You missed. 
SINJIN Gimme that motherfuckin' gun. 
Sinjin grabs the GUN from Louie. KWON is sitting up, still dazed, holding a HANDKERCHIEF to stem the flow of blood streaming out of his nose. 
RJ Cops're here. 
Sinjin turns to inspect the room, contemplating the situation.   He walks toward Jimmy's BACKPACK. 
RJ (CONT'D) We should go, Sinjin. 
SINJIN (facetious) I'm not sure about that, RJ! Let's break out the chalk board, some X's and O's, an' make fer certain! (taking command) Just toss Louie out the fuckin' window! 
KWON Sinjin, those are my drugs. 
SINJIN (holding out the Backpack) These are my drugs, (pointing at the BOWLING BALL BAG) That's your money. 
LOUIE (to RJ) Easy motherfucker! 
RJ drops Louie out the window like a sack of bird seed, Louie is followed by the remains of his wheelchair, then by RJ himself. Kwon stands up and grabs the bowling ball bag. 
KWON That's my gun, too. 
SINJIN (heading out the window after RJ) I'll send it UPS. 
Sinjin disappears out the window.   Bobby is about to follow, but turns back toward Jimmy. 
BOBBY You owe me. 
Bobby exits.   Kwon stands over Jimmy. 
KWON (foreboding) I'll see you around, Jimmy. 
Jimmy watches as Kwon exits out the window.

CONRAD Yeah. I'm seeing a doctor. Are you? 
KAREN Uh... Uh, well, Dr. Crawford gave me a name, and I went for a while. But uh... I dunno.It just didn't work for me, I guess. He just kept telling me all the things I already knew, and , uh... finally, I decided... the only one who can help me is myself. At least, that's what my dad says. I don't mean it's not right for you, Conrad. I mean I think that if it's something you want to do, that's what you should be doing. 
CONRAD Well, ya, I don't know how long I'll keep it up. I sorta got shoved into it.

COACH SALAN You gotta be kidding me. I don't get it. I excuse you from practice twice a week so you can see some shrink. I work with you every damn night at your convenience. What the hell more am I supposed to do for you? 
CONRAD Nothing. 
COACH SALAN Bright kid like you, everything going for you. See, I don't get it. Why do you wanna keep messing up your life?

Dr Berger fiddles for his keys in the dark to open his office's door. 
DR BERGER Just wait, just hold on... 
CONRAD I need...     I need...

DR BERGER Shit. You'd think they'd assume there'd be an emergency now and then?! 
DR BERGER (cont'd) Don't take it off. Just sit down. 
Conrad cries. 
CONRAD Something happened! 
DR BERGER What? 
CONRAD It's...

DR BERGER For what? 
CONRAD For what I did! 
DR BERGER What did you do? 
CONRAD What I did to him! 
DR BERGER What did you do? 
CONRAD It's something... It's something... Don't you see? It's gotta be somebody's fault or there's no godamm point! 
DR BERGER Point? What point? It happened! 
CONRAD No, no... Oh, no. I don't mean that. It's that... It's just that... Buck, Bucky, I didn't mean it!

CONRAD ...and I couldn't! 
CONRAD I just wish I'd known...I could've done something. 
DR BERGER You saw her once and now you' want to take her on too? 
CONRAD No! 
DR BERGER No? 
CONRAD No. I just... 
DR BERGER What? 
CONRAD That isn't it. I... I feel bad about this, I feel really bad about this. And just let me feel bad about this! 
DR BERGER Okay. Listen. I feel bad about it too. 
CONRAD Why do things have to happen to people? It isn't fair.

Conrad cries 
CONRAD I'm scared! I'm scared. 
DR BERGER Feelings are scary. And sometimes they're painful. And if you can't feel pain, then you're not gonna feel anything else either. You know what I'm saying? 
CONRAD I think so. 
DR BERGER You're here and you're alive. And don't tell me you don't feel that. 
CONRAD It doesn't feel good. 
DR BERGER It is good. Believe me.

Conrad is out of breath. 
BETH What? 
CALVIN What you started. 
BETH What I started? 
CALVIN What you started. 
BETH Ha! There's no point discussing it. 
CALVIN I think there is a point. 
BETH He controls you even when you are two thousand miles away. 
CALVIN He isn't the problem. 
BETH Isn't he? 
CALVIN No, he isn't. Let's talk about what's really bothering you. 
BETH No, no. Let's talk about what's bothering you. Cos' that's what you want, isn't it? 
CALVIN Jesus, what have I done to make you so angry with me? 
(CONTINUED) 
151   CONTINUED:                                                 151 
BETH It's not what you've done, it's what you think I've done. You blame me for the whole thing. 
CALVIN Can't you see anything except in terms of how it affects you? 
BETH No! I can't! And neither can you, and neither can anybody else! Only maybe I'm just a little more honest about it! 
CALVIN Well, stop being so godamn honest, and start being a little generous! And start thinking about him for a while! 
BETH I don't know what he expects from me. I never have known. 
CALVIN Well, I'll tell you what he expects! 
BETH What? He wants me to throw my arms around him everytime he passes an exam? Well, I can't do it! I cannot respond when someone says: "Here, I just did this great thing. Love me.". I can't! 
CALVIN All he wants... All he wants is to know you don't hate him. That's it. 
BETH Hate him? My God! How could I hate him? Mothers don't hate their sons! Is that what he told you? Do you see how you accept what he says with no questions, and you can't do the same thing to me, can you? 
CALVIN I just try to keep this family together... 
(CONTINUED) 
151   CONTINUED:                                                   151 
BETH (she shouts) I don't know what everyone wants from me anymore! 
AUDREY Beth, nobody wants anything from you. 
WARD Beth, listen. We all just want... Cal, Con, everybody, we just want you to be happy. 
BETH Happy? 
WARD Yes. 
BETH Ward, you tell me the definition of happy, uh? But first, you better make sure that your kids are good and safe, that no one's fallen off a horse, or been hit by a car, or drowned in that swimming pool you're so proud of! And then you come to me and tell me how to be happy! 
She leaves. Calvin follows. Ward and his wife just stand there. 
152   INT. JET ­ DAY                                               152 
Beth stares away from Calvin, as in a void. She sighs, closes her eyes; Calvin turns away from the window, looks at Beth and remembers... 
When they were happily dancing...    [ to and fro twice] 
Calvin in his plane seat, reflects.

CONRAD Yeah. It was kind of a rough week. 
CALVIN I hope your grandmother wasn't too tough on you? 
CONRAD No. She was fine. I'm glad you're back. 
Conrad gives his mother a hug, but she is like made of stone. Calvin sees it. 
CONRAD (cont'd) Good night. 
Beth remains transfixed as if she didn't know what it was all about. Calvin sees it. 
154   INT. BEDROOM ­ NIGHT                                       154 
Beth is not sleeping, she looks up, sees her husband wrinkled pillow, but he is not in bed. She looks at the time, gets up, puts on a robe. 
155   INT. STAIRS ­ NIGHT                                        155

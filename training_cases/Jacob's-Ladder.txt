"JACOB'S LADDER" 
by 
Bruce Joel Rubin 
EXT.  VIETNAM - DUSK 
A swarm of helicopters swoops out of a yellow sky and deposits an army of men over a Vietnamese hillside. 
The SOLDIERS scramble over the terraced rice paddies for the protection of the jungle. Falling into coulmns, like strands of soldier ants, seventy-five men, at combat readiness, assemble on the edge of a sweltering wilderness. 
It is dusk. The mood is lazy, soporific. Members of one platoon huddle close to the ground smoking a joint. JERRY Strong stuff. 
ROD (to JACOB, a soldier squatting several yards away) Hey, Professor, how many times can you shit in an hour? 
GEORGE Don't bug 'im. 
DOUG Where are those gooks already? 
FRANK Some offensive. I don't even think they're out there. 
PAUL Jesus, this grass is something else. 
JACOB SINGER returns to the group, pulling up his pants. 
ROD Why even bother to pull 'em up? 
FRANK You jackin' off out there again, huh Jake? 
PAUL Hey, get off his back. 
ROD It's called philosophizing, right Professor? 
JACOB gives them the finger. 
JACOB Up yours, you adolescent scum. 
Laughter. 
SERGEANT (V.O.) Mount your bayonets. 
FRANK (frightened) Oh shit! 
PAUL Goddam! 
ROD Gimme that joint! 
JERRY Hey, something's wrong. 
GEORGE What is it? 
JERRY My head. 
GEORGE It's nerves. Take another toke. 
GEORGE reaches out, extending a joint. Suddenly he gasps and falls to the ground, his body convulsing uncontrollably. The others stand back, startled. JACOB grabs him and shoves a rifle barrel between his chattering teeth. 
ROD What's going on? 
Before anyone can answer JERRY grabs his head, screaming. He turns frantically in all directions. 
JERRY Help me! Help me! 
PAUL What the hell ... ? 
In seconds JERRY is spinning wildly out of control, his head shaking into a terrific blur. He crashes into FRANK with the force of a truck. FRANK slams into the ground as all the air rushes from his lungs. He begins gasping and hyperventilating. His eyes grow wide and frenzied as he gulps for air. Fear and confusion sweep across his face. The MEN watch, horrified, as FRANK's terror escalates beyond reason into all- out panic. 
Suddenly FRANK begins howling. He lunges for his bayonet and, without warning, attacks the MEN around him. 
PAUL God Almighty! 
PAUL spins out of the way as FRANK's bayonet impales the ground. JACOB jumps on top of FRANK and wrestles him into the tall grass. PAUL rushes to his assistance. 
JACOB stares at FRANK's face as FRANK struggles beneath him. It is the face of a madman. 
PAUL Good God! What's happening? 
The sudden chaos is intensified by the sound of fighting erupting behind them. Guns crackle and bursts of light penetrate the darkening sky. 
ROD Behind you! Look out! This is it! 
The MEN spin around. PAUL panics and jumps to his feet, leaving JACOB alone with FRANK. FRANK's eyes burn with demonic force as he gathers his strength. 
JACOB Don't leave me. 
Dark figures, silhouetted by the setting sun, are storming at them. SOLDIERS squint to see. It is a horrifying vision. 
PAUL They're coming! 
JACOB steps off a graffiti-festooned ELEVATOR into a long impersonal hallway. He uses three keys to unlock the door to his APARTMENT. 
INT.  JACOB'S APT. - DAWN 
JACOB enters the darkness without turning on the light. He tries to navigate his way to the BATHROOM, illuminated by a tiny nightlight in the distance. His effort is unsuccessful. He bangs loudly into a table. A WOMAN"s voice calls out. 
JEZZIE (V.O.) Jake, is that you? 
JACOB What the hell did you do, move all the furniture? 
JEZZIE (V.O.) Why didn't you turn on the light? 
JACOB I didn't want to wake you. 
JEZZIE (V.O.) (sleepy but pleasant) Gee, thanks a lot. 
JACOB Where is the lamp? 
JEZZIE (V.O.) Where are you? 
JACOB If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was. 
JEZZIE (V.O.) I moved the couch. That's all. 
JACOB Where to? 
JACOB crashes into it. A light suddenly goes on. JEZEBEL "JEZZIE" PIPKIN, 33, is standing in the BEDROOM door tying a man's terrycloth bathrobe around her waist. Although sleepy, disheveled, and not looking her best, it is obvious that JEZZIE is a beefy woman, juicy and sensual. 
JEZZIE That help? 
JACOB (nearly sprawled over the couch) Thanks. 
He pushes himself up. 
JEZZIE What do you think? 
JACOB What do you mean? 
JEZZIE The room! 
JACOB Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow. 
JEZZIE It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late? 
JACOB Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time. 
JEZZIE (seeing the grease on his uniform) What happened to you? 
JACOB (unbuttoning his shirt as he walks to the BATHROOM) Don't ask. 
JACOB steps into the BATHROOM and pulls at his clothes, leaving them in a pile on the floor. He reaches for the faucet and sends a stream of water pouding against the porcelain tub. JEZZIE enjoys JACOB's nakedness. She reaches out to his chest and squeezes one of his nipples. His body tenses slightly. JEZZIE drops her robe. They enter the shower together. 
EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT 
A DENSE RAIN falls on a dark night filling puddles of water. JACOB is crawling through the underbrush in the Vietnamese JUNGLE. His shirt is bloodsoaked. He moves slowly, creeping on his right forearm. His left arm is holding his intestines from spilling onto the grass. 
JACOB Help me. Someone. 
Suddenly a flashlight beam can be seen in the distance. It dances around the bamboo trees and draws closer to JACOB. It is impossible to see who is carrying it. The light darts near the ground where JACOB is lying and then bursts directly into his eyes. 
INT.  JACOB'S APT. - DAY 
SUNLIGHT pours through the BEDROOM window. JACOB is sleeping fitfully as a bar of light saturates his face. His hand rushes up to cover and protect his eyes but the damage is done. He is awake. 
JACOB lies in bed for a few moments, dazed. Slowly his hand gropes along the shelf at the head of the bed, searching for his glasses. He has trouble finding them. As his hand sweeps blindly across the headboard it hits the telephone and sends it crashing to the floor. He sits up with a disgusted look on his face and searches the out-of-focus shelf behind him. Suddenly JEZZIE enters. 
JEZZIE You up? 
JACOB No. Have you seen my glasses? 
JEZZIE (shaking her head) Where'd you leave 'em? 
JACOB I don't know. 
JEZZIE Did you look around the headboard? 
JACOB (wearily) Jezzie, I can't see. 
JEZZIE (she scans the shelf) Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom. 
She leaves and returns moments later with his glasses and a large paper bag. She tosses them both onto the bed. 
JACOB Thanks. (he puts on his glasses and notices the bag) What's that? 
JEZZIE Your kid dropped it off. 
JACOB Who? Jed? 
JEZZIE (stooping to pick up the phone) No. The little one. 
JACOB Ready? 
JEZZIE Just gettin' rid of the garbage. 
JACOB and JEZZIE, both wearing postal uniforms, head for the ELEVATOR. They are surprised that it has arrived promptly. JEZZIE reaches out and playfully sticks her tongue into JACOB's ear. He pulls her into the ELEVATOR. They disappear, laughing, behind its closing doors. 
EXT.  NEW YORK CITY - DAY 
JACOB is driving a mail truck through the crowded streets of midtown Manhattan. As he drives he is humming to himself a rendition of Al Jolson's "Sonny Boy." 
JACOB stops his truck in front of a LAUNDRY on West 46th Street. He opens the back door and pulls a stack of boxes toward him. He lifts them with effort and slams the door with his foot. It doesn't close. He considers giving it another whack but the boxes are heavy. He turns instead and waddles toward the store. 
INT.  LAUNDRY - DAY 
A heavyset WOMAN with a dark tan is standing behind a counter cluttered with laundry. A picture of Richard Nixon is still stapled to the wall. She looks at JACOB. 
WOMAN Where do you expect me to put those? I don't have any room. 
She tries clearing the counter, but it doesn't help. 
WOMAN (continuing) How 'bout over there? (she points to a table) No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room. 
JACOB They're awfully heavy. 
WOMAN I know. That's why I'm asking. 
JACOB waddles reluctantly toward the back of the store. CHINESE LAUNDERERS are hovering over piles of clothes. Steam from the pressing machines shoots into the air. 
JACOB (huffing and puffing) Where's Wong? 
WOMAN That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired. 
JACOB stoops to put the boxes on the shelf. There is a snapping sound and he winces in pain. Massaging his back, JACOB unfolds some papers for the WOMAN's signature. 
JACOB How was Palm Springs? 
WOMAN Hot. Where do I sign? 
JACOB (pointing to the line) You got a nice tan, though. 
WOMAN Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask? (she looks heavenward) Two hundred dollars a night, for what? 
She hands JACOB the wrong sheet. 
JACOB No. I'll take the other one. (he takes it) Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably. 
WOMAN If you're lucky. 
JACOB smiles to himself as he leaves the store. He walks carefully. His back is out. 
INT.  MAIL TRUCK - DAY 
ANGLE ON THE MAIL TRUCK stuck in traffic. Nothing is moving. Horns are blaring and drivers are agitated. JACOB reaches for a newspaper lying on top of his mail bags. To his shock one of the bags appears to move. Curious, JACOB pokes at it. Instantly a terrifying figure pops out from beneath it and stares at him with a frightening glare. JACOB jumps back, stunned. It is a moment before he realizes that he is looking at an old WINO who has been sleeping in the truck. The man's face is covered in strange bumps. 
JACOB Goddamn it! What the hell ... ? 
WINO (pleading) I didn't take nothin'. I was just napping. Don't hit me. I was cold. 
JACOB (lifting the man up) What the hell do you think you're doing? You can't do this. This is government property. 
He begins opening the door. The WINO begs. 
WINO Don't throw me out. They're gonna get me. They'll tear me to pieces. 
He holds on to JACOB's leg. JACOB tries to pull away. 
JACOB Come on. You can't stay here. 
WINO Please! I never hurt anybody when I was alive. Believe me. I don't belong here. 
JACOB gives the WINO a strange look and then escorts him from the truck. A hundred eyes peer out of motionless cars and follow him as he leads the WINO to the sidewalk. JACOB pulls a dollar bill from his pocket and places it in the WINO's hand. The OLD MAN crumples it into a ball and turns away. He has a frightened look on his face. JACOB returns to the truck shaking his head. 
JACOB New York! 
He climbs into his seat and glances into his rear view mirror. He notices the WINO edging fearfully along the side of a building. A horn honks and traffic begins moving. When JACOB looks back the WINO is no longer there. 
INT.  GARAGE - DAY 
JACOB drives his mail truck into the huge POST OFFICE PARKING GARAGE on 34th Street. His mind seems distracted. He has difficulty parking. 
INT.  POST OFFICE - DAY 
We see a vast room filled with hundreds of PEOPLE sorting and moving mail. 
JACOB, carrying a bag of McDonald's hamburgers, walks stiffly through the aisles, his left hand rubbing his back. Several workers greet him and grab for his french fries. He offers them around. 
ANGLE ON a conveyor belt sorting mail. A hand reaches in, correcting mistakes. Suddenly a hamburger passes by. JEZZIE looks up and smiles. 
JEZZIE Jake! 
JACOB I can't relax. 
LOUIS Wiggle your toes. 
JACOB wiggles his toes. At that instant, LOUIS twists JACOB's neck rapidly. There is a loud cracking sound. 
EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT 
THERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT. A MAN rushes at the camera yelling. 
MAN I found one. He's alive. 
He shines a flashlight into the lens creating rings and halos. 
CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - DAY 
Suddenly LOUIS reappears, a halo effect still visible behind his head. 
JACOB God almighty. What did you do to me? 
LOUIS I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit. 
JACOB I had this weird flash just then. 
LOUIS What? 
JACOB I don't know. I've been having them recently. (he thinks a moment, then changes the subject) You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that? 
LOUIS Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you. 
JACOB Louis, you're a life saver. 
LOUIS I know. 
EXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS - EVENING 
JACOB is walking down Nostrand Avenue. He is singing to himself and imitating Al Jolson. 
JACOB When there are gray skies, I don't mind the gray skies, as long as there's you ... 
He hums. It is near dusk and lights are just coming on. The shop windows have a particularly garish look about them. The mannequins are dressed in inexpensive, almost tawdry, clothes and have a pathetic appearance. A few shops have set up their Christmas decorations. 
The ornamentation seems strangely out of place; almost blasphemous. 
JACOB passes a street gang standing in the doorway of a local drug store. They chortle and make taunting sounds. 
GIRL (shaking her tits, singing) "Hey, Mr. Postman ... " 
JACOB stops and stares at them. To their surprise, he begins to sing with them. He knows the words. They like that. It is a sweet moment. 
JACOB continues walking. He comes to a cross street. The light is green. He is still singing to himself and does not notice a BLACK CAR sharging around the corner. The car is moving at full speed, heading straight toward him. A YOUNG MAN walking a few steps behind yells out. 
YOUNG MAN Look out! 
JACOB turns and sees the car. He scoots out of the way but it swerves in his direction. The YOUNG MAN calls out again. 
YOUNG MAN Jump! 
With a huge thrust, JACOB hurls himself onto the curb as the car shoots by. Two MEN are peering at him from the back seat. They are laughing like madmen and shaking their heads. They do not look human. JACOB yells and waves his fist, to no effect. After a moment he turns to thank the YOUNG MAN whose scream had saved him, but he is gone. 
INT.  JACOB'S APT. - DUSK 
JACOB and JEZZIE are lying in bed. They are a sensual couple and even in quiet, reflective moments such as this, their positioning is erotic and stimulating. Both of them are nude. JACOB's hands are clasped behind his neck and he is staring mournfully at the ceiling. JEZZIE is lying on her side, her left leg draped across JACOB's pelvis. Her head is propped up on her right arm while her left hand strokes the bayonet scar on JACOB's stomach. Neither are talking. Suddenly, out of the blue, JEZZIE speaks. 
JEZZIE Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife. 
JACOB Why do you bring her up? 
JEZZIE 'Cause she's always on your mind. 
JACOB When was the last time I said a word? 
JEZZIE It has nothin' to do with talkin'. 
She pauses for a while, long enough to suppose that the conversation is over. Then she continues. 
JEZZIE (continuing) Or maybe it's the war. 
JACOB closes his eyes. 
JEZZIE (continuing) It's still there, Jake. (she points to his brain) Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ... 
JACOB (annoyed) What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures? 
JEZZIE New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed. 
JACOB They're like demons, Jez. 
JEZZIE Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not. (she rubs his forehead) It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is. 
JACOB doesn't stop. A POLICEMAN, guarding the entrance, runs after him. 
JACOB charges through the interior corridors of the aging institution. A LINE OF MENTAL PATIENTS, all holding hands, is moving down the hall. They break ranks as he charges by and begin to scream. Their ATTENDANT tries to calm them down but the sight of the POLICEMAN increases their hysteria. They grab hold of him as he tries to get by. 
POLICEMAN LET GO! GET AWAY! 
INT.  GROUP ROOM - DAY 
JACOB dashes out of view. He runs down another corridor, wildly searching for a specific room. He finds it and rushes inside. He is surprised to find A GROUP OF MEN AND WOMEN seated in a circle. They all look up at him. 
LEADER Can I help you? 
JACOB I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office? 
The LEADER stares at him uncomfortably. After a moment he gets up and takes JACOB into a corner of the room. Everyone is watching them. The LEADER speaks quietly. 
LEADER I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died. 
JACOB (stunned) Died? 
LEADER A car accident. 
JACOB Jesus, Jesus! ... When? 
LEADER Last month, before Thanksgiving. 
JACOB How did it happen? 
LEADER No one knows. They say it blew up. 
JACOB (growing pale) Blew up? What do you mean it blew up? 
The LEADER shrugs and tries to put his arm around JACOB, but he pulls away. 
LEADER Do you want me to get someone? 
JACOB No. No. It's okay. I'm okay. 
He backs quickly to the door. As he turns to leave he realizes that all of the PEOPLE in the group are watching him intently. 
Unsettled, JACOB hurries back into the hallway. He is frightened and confused. Suddenly a voice calls out. 
POLICEMAN HEY YOU! MAILMAN! 
JACOB turns and sees the POLICEMAN waiting for him. His gun is drawn. 
POLICEMAN Hold it. Just hold it. Where the hell do you think you are? This is Bellevue, for God's sake. People running around here get shot. 
The GROUP LEADER pokes his head out of the door and motions to the POLICEMAN. 
LEADER It's alright. He's okay. 
POLICEMAN (nodding, reholstering his gun) Come on, get out of here. I wouldn't want to interfere with the U.S. Mail. 
He leads JACOB toward the lobby. JACOB does not look back. 
INT.  DELLA'S APT. - NIGHT 
WE HEAR LOUD DANCE MUSIC. SLY AND THE FAMILY STONE. JACOB is with some POST OFFICE EMPLOYEES at a crowded party in a small apartment. A DRUNK is telling a bad joke and trying to hold a glass of wine at the same time. It is constantly on the verge of spilling. JACOB is fixated on it. In the background, we see JEZZIE dancing and motioning for JACOB to join her. He nods no. The DRUNK, who keeps asking people if they "get it," takes JACOB's head nodding as a sign of confusion and keeps trying to re-explain the joke. 
JACOB hears a strange noise and looks around. It seems to be coming from a covered bird cage. He goes over to it and lifts the cover. The BIRD is flapping its wings wildly as if trying to get out. The sound, loud and insistent, startles him. He lowers the cover. 
In the DINING ROOM, several people are gathered around ELSA, an attractive black woman who is reading palms. She sees JACOB and calls over the music. 
ELSA Hey, you! Let me look at your hand! 
JACOB shrugs. DELLA, dancing nearby, calls out. 
DELLA Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book. 
JACOB No, thanks. 
DELLA It's fun. 
CUT TO A CLOSE UP OF JACOB'S HAND. ELSA is squeezing the mounds and examining the lines. What begins as a playful expression on her face turns suddenly serious. She reaches for his other hand and compares the two of them. JEZZIE looks over from her dancing and eyes the scene jealously. 
ELSA You have an unusual hand. 
JACOB I could have told you that. 
ELSA You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split. 
She studies his life line with growing concern. JEZZIE tries to get JACOB's attention. He ignores her. 
ELSA (continuing) You know, you got a strange line here. 
JACOB (examining it) It's short, huh? 
ELSA Short? It's ended. 
JACOB Where? 
JEZZIE What do you mean? Where do you think? 
JACOB Where's Della? Bring her here? 
JEZZIE Why? What for? 
JACOB Show me Della! 
JEZZIE (confused) Hey, I'm here. 
JACOB eyes her with a pleading look. Annoyed, JEZZIE leaves JACOB and crosses the room. He watches her as she goes. JACOB is holding his stomach and rocking painfully. Moments later JEZZIE returns with DELLA. 
DELLA Hiya Jake. That was some dance. 
JACOB (staring at her closely) Della? 
DELLA (feeling the strangeness) You want to see me? Well, here I am. 
JACOB I see. 
DELLA What do you want? 
JACOB Just to see you. That's all. 
DELLA (a bit uncomfortable) Well, how do I look? 
JACOB Like Della. 
Suddenly JACOB breaks out in a dense sweat and begins shaking. His entire body is convulsive. 
JEZZIE Are you feeling all right? Shit, you're burning up. Feel his forehead. 
DELLA (checking his forehead and cheeks) Damn, that's hot. Maybe from dancing. 
JEZZIE I think you should lie down. 
JACOB is shaking uncontrollably. People are gathering around. 
JEZZIE (continuing) Can't you stop it? 
JACOB If I could stop it, I'd stop it. 
WOMAN Is he sick? 
DELLA He's on fire. 
ELSA Let me help you. 
She reaches out to JACOB. Unexpectedly he recoils, jumping to his feet like a wild man. He begins to scream. 
JACOB Stay away from me! Don't you come near me! All of you. Go to hell! Go to hell, goddamn you! Stay away! 
JEZZIE stares at JACOB with a confused and embarrassed look. A MAN whispers to her. 
MAN I'll call a cab. 
INT.  JACOB'S APT. - NIGHT 
JACOB is lying in bed in his own BEDROOM with a thermometer in his mouth. JEZZIE is pacing the floor with great agitation. 
JEZZIE I've never been so mortified in my whole life. Never! Screaming like that. I don't understand what's gotten into you, Jake, to make you do a thing like that. You're not acting normal. I've lived with too many crazies in my life. I don't want it anymore. I can't handle it. I'm tired of men flipping out on me. Shit, you'd think it was my fault. Well you picked me, remember that. I don't need this. 
The NEIGHBOR pounds on the wall. 
JEZZIE (continuing) All right! All right! 
JEZZIE jabs her finger at the wall. 
JEZZIE (continuing) If you go crazy on me you're goin' crazy by yourself. You understand? 
JEZZIE reaches for his mouth and pulls out the thermometer. She looks at it closely and then squints to see it better. 
JACOB What's it say? A hundred and two? 
JEZZIE I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor. 
She runs out of the room. JACOB calls after her. 
JACOB What does it say? 
JEZZIE (V.O.) It's gone to the top. 
JACOB How high is that? 
JEZZIE (V.O.) The numbers stop at 107. 
JEZZIE is on the phone to the doctor in the next room. 
FADE IN sounds of feet shuffling across the carpet. A glass rattles on a tray. A television is on low in the background. Slowly the CAMERA LENS opens from JACOB's P.O.V. and we see JEZZIE puttering around the BEDROOM. Suddenly she is aware that JACOB is watching her. She smiles. 
JEZZIE Jake. (she places her hand on his head and strokes his hair) You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine. 
JACOB Am I home? 
JEZZIE You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil. (she smiles) What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh? 
JACOB Are we in Brooklyn? 
JEZZIE You're right here, Jake. You just rest. (she puffs up his pillow) The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate. (she strokes his forehead, and gets up) Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up. 
JEZZIE leaves the room. JACOB watches her as she goes. He seems lost and confused. 
INT.  JACOB'S KITCHEN - DAY 
JACOB, unshaven, wearing his bathrobe, is sitting at the KITCHEN TABLE. PILES OF BOOKS on demonology are spread out before him. He studies them to distraction. JEZZIE is standing by the counter making sandwiches. She wraps them in plastic Baggies and puts one in a lunch box, another in the refrigerator. She is dressed in her postal uniform. 
JEZZIE You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time. (JEZZIE knocks on JACOB's head) Hello! Anybody home? (she looks in his ear) Anybody in there? 
JACOB What? 
JEZZIE just stares at him. She does not respond. JACOB returns to his books. 
CUT TO CLOSE UP IMAGES OF WINGED DEMONS, real demons, with spindly horns and long tails. JACOB's huge finger, magnified, scans page after page of ancient images and archaic text. JEZZIE, enraged at his lack of attention, returns to packing her lunch box. Suddenly she spins around. 
JEZZIE Goddamn it! I can't stand it anymore. I've had it up to here. Go ahead and rot if you want ... You son-of-a- bitch, I'm talking to you. 
CUT BACK to the DEMONS. Suddenly a crashing sound catches JACOB's attention as a KITCHEN POT flies by his head. He looks up to see JEZZIE knocking pots and pans off the kitchen counter and kicking them wildly across the room. The noise is terrible. The intensity of her rage is shocking. The pots crash into every surface, knocking all his books onto the floor. And then, suddenly, she stops. 
JEZZIE stoops down to the floor and picks up her sandwich, stuffs it back in its plastic Baggie, and puts it back in her lunch box. She is about to leave when she stops and looks at JACOB. 
JEZZIE (continuing, her anger in check) I made you a tuna fish sandwich. It's in the fridge. Eat a carrot with it. The aspirin's on the bottom shelf. We're out of soap so, if for some reason you decide to wash yourself again, use the dishwashing stuff. (she walks out of the room and returns with her coat) I'm sorry I yelled, but you get on my nerves. (she bends down and makes eye contact with JACOB) Hello? Listen, I gotta go. 
JEZZIE sits on his lap, gives him a big kiss, and then, unexpectedly, raises two fingers, like horns, over her head. The gesture catches JACOB's full attention. 
JEZZIE (continuing) Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind. (she kisses his cheek) Love me a little? 
JACOB (speaking with affection) You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up. 
Suddenly the telephone rings. It startles them. 
JEZZIE Oh shit. Tell 'em I've left. 
JEZZIE grabs her jacket and shoves her arm in it upside down. A pocketful of change falls on the floor. JACOB smiles. JEZZIE curses as she struggles to pick it up and get the jacket on right. JACOB gets the phone. 
JACOB Hello. 
PAUL (V.O.) Jacob Singer? 
JACOB Speaking. 
PAUL (V.O.) Paul Gruneger! 
JACOB Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned! 
JACOB indicates it's for him. JEZZIE throws him a kiss goodbye and hurries out the door. 
JACOB (continuing) Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years? 
PAUL (V.O.) A long time. 
JACOB Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life? 
PAUL (V.O.) Nothin' much. 
JACOB Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor? 
PAUL (V.O.) I need to see you, Jake. 
JACOB Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick. 
PAUL (V.O.) I need to see you. 
INT.  PAUL'S CAR - DAY 
JACOB and PAUL are driving through EAST NEW YORK heading toward WILLIAMSBURG. The elevated trains rumble above them. JACOB pats PAUL on the back. 
JACOB Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds. 
PAUL I work in a bakery. 
JACOB You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed? 
PAUL Count 'em on one hand. 
JACOB It's almost like a conspiracy, huh? 
PAUL No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it. 
JACOB Everywhere, like a plague. 
PAUL God almighty. I thought I was the only one. 
JACOB Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams. 
PAUL Oh God. I know. I know. 
JACOB What is it Paul? What's happening to me? 
PAUL They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire. (he fumbles in his coat pocket and pulls out a small Bible and silver cross) I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army. 
JACOB (stunned) The army? 
PAUL She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us? 
JACOB I don't know. I don't know. 
PAUL They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something. 
JACOB leans back in the booth, his mind racing. The YOUNG MAN in the next booth is watching them with rapt attention. 
INT.  MEN'S ROOM - DAY 
PAUL and JACOB are in the MEN'S ROOM. PAUL flushes the urinal. 
PAUL I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home. 
JACOB You come home with me. 
PAUL What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind? 
JACOB Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there. 
PAUL smiles. 
EXT.  BAR - DAY 
The TWO MEN leave the bar on a dingy side street. It is cold outside. Christmas lights seem ludicrous dangling in the bar's front window. PAUL looks at them and smiles. 
PAUL Merry Christmas. 
PAUL steps into the street and walks to the driver's side of his car. He pulls out his keys and opens the door. JACOB looks down on the sidewalk and notices a dime. 
JACOB Goddamn, this is my lucky day. 
He bends down to pick it up. PAUL inserts the key into the ignition and steps on the gas. He turns the key. 
THE CAR EXPLODES. Pieces of metal and flesh fly into the air. JACOB sprawls out flat on the ground as the debris hurls above him. He covers his head. 
EXT.  VIETNAM 
CUT TO A HELICOPTER suffering an air bombardment. Flack is exploding all around it and the shock waves are rocking the craft violently. JACOB's eyes peer to the left. 
INFANTRY GUNNERS are firing rockets into the JUNGLE below. A pair of MEDICS are huddled over him. A sudden gush of arterial bleeding sends a stream of blood splattering over the inside of the windshield. The PILOT, unable to see, clears it away with his hands. 
JACOB screams over the roar of the chopper. One of the MEDICS presses his ear close to JACOB to hear. 
JACOB Help me! 
MEDIC We're doing the best we can. 
JACOB Get me out of here! 
EXT.  BAR - DAY 
THE YOUNG MAN from the bar grabs JACOB under the arms and drags him down the sidewalk. 
YOUNG MAN Just hold on. 
JACOB Where am I? Who are you? 
The YOUNG MAN yanks JACOB around the corner just as another explosion consumes the car. The air is filled with flames and flying debris. The YOUNG MAN pulls JACOB into the bar. 
YOUNG MAN Just lie still. You're okay. You're not hurt. 
The CUSTOMERS are in a state of bedlam. Part of the wall has blown apart and bricks and glass are everywhere. The cross from around PAUL's neck is buried in the debris. Sirens are heard in the distance. A BLACK CAR speeds off down the street. JACOB looks for the YOUNG MAN who had helped him. He is gone. 
EXT.  FUNERAL PROCESSION - DAY 
A FUNERAL PROCESSION heads down Ocean Parkway. 
INT.  JACOB'S CAR - DAY 
JACOB and JEZZIE are driving in an old Chevy Nova. They are dressed up. JACOB's face is bruised and he has a gauze pad over his ear. They drive in silence. JACOB appears very sad. Slowly his right hand reaches across the seat, seeking JEZZIE's. Their fingers embrace. 
EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY 
The FUNERAL PROCESSION enters the CEMETERY. Cars park along the length of the narrow road. MEN IN DARK SUITS emerge from their cars along with WIVES and GIRLFRIENDS. 
He hesitates. They all understand. 
ROD What's that have to do with anything? 
FRANK It was bad grass. That's all it was. 
JERRY Grass never did that to me. 
DOUG You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing. 
ROD It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over. 
JACOB ... I've seen them, too. 
ROD Shit! 
JERRY So have I. 
JACOB Look, there's something fucking strange going on here. You know Paul's not the only one who's died. You remember Dr. Carlson over at Bellevue? His car blew up, too. 
ROD Dr. Carlson's dead? 
JACOB An explosion, just like Paul's. 
JERRY No! 
FRANK Jesus! 
GEORGE You think they're connected? 
JACOB (he nods) I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy. 
ROD Not me, buddy. 
JACOB Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on. 
DOUG Do you think it has something to do with ... the offensive? 
JACOB It's got something to do with some- thing. I think we've got to confront the army. If they're hiding shit from us, we better find out what it is. 
ROD Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall. 
JACOB Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one. 
ROD Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you. 
JACOB We should get ourselves a lawyer. 
ROD I say you should get a shrink. 
DOUG Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game. 
JERRY Me, too. 
ROD You guys are fucking paranoid. It was bad grass. That's all it was. There's no such thing as demons. 
INT.  LAW OFFICE - DAY 
JACOB, FRANK, JERRY, GEORGE, DOUG, and ROD are sitting on plush chairs in the LAW OFFICE of DONALD GEARY. GEARY, a red-faced man with three chins, is sucking on an ice cube. He looks at each of the men, and then spits the ice cube into an empty glass. It clinks. 
GEARY I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart. 
JACOB This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what. 
GEARY The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean? 
JACOB Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man. 
GEARY Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here? 
GEARY stands up and grabs a bag of Cheetos from a file drawer. He chomps down a few and offers the bag to the others. There are no takers. Thirsty, he downs the ice cube and cracks it between his teeth. 
GEARY (continuing) Okay. I'll look into it. 
The MEN are surprised and excited. 
PAUL Wow! Do you think we have a chance? 
GEARY What do you want, a fortune teller or a lawyer? ... I'll need sworn depositions from each of you and a list of the other members of the platoon, or their survivors. 
DOUG Hey, this is great. 
GEARY I'll tell you, if we find the military is implicated in any way, you could stand to recover quite a lot of money. Not that I can predict anything, but some class action suits of this kind have been awarded fairly generous judgements. That wouldn't be so bad, would it Mr. Singer? 
JACOB Doctor. (GEARY looks at him oddly) Ph.D. 
GEARY Ah! I thought you were a mailman. 
JACOB I am. 
BEARER No waller. Nothing. 
JACOB They stole it. 
RESIDENT Who did? 
JACOB I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had. 
RESIDENT We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call? 
NURSE I'll page him. 
JACOB Call my chiropractor. 
NURSE We're doing everything we can. 
JACOB Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue. 
RESIDENT I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little. 
JACOB No. Don't move me. 
The RESIDENT ignores him. JACOB screams. 
RESIDENT I don't have to ask if you can feel that. 
JACOB Goddamn it. I want Louis. 
NURSE Who's Louis? 
RESIDENT He's out of it. I'm taking him down to X-ray. 
An ORDERLY pushes the gurney through a pair of sliding doors. JACOB tries to get up but the pain keeps him immobilized. 
INT.  CORRIDORS - NIGHT 
JACOB begins a journey down what appears to be an endless series of corridors. The wheels of the gurney turn with a hypnotic regularity. The smooth tile floor gives way to roguh cement. The ORDERLY's feet plod through pools of blood that coagulate in cracks and crevices along the way. The surface grows rougher, the wheels more insistent. Body parts and human bile splash against the walls as the gurney moves faster. 
JACOB Where are you taking me? Where am I? 
ORDERLY You know where you are. 
JACOB, panicked, tries again to get up but to no effect. He glances to the side and sees mournful CREATURES being led into dark rooms. No one fights or struggles. We hear muffled screams from behind closed doors. Occasionally he glances inside the rooms and sees mangled bodies in strange contraptions, people in rusty iron lungs, and hanging from metal cages. Dark eyes peer out in horror. In one room a baseboard heater bursts into flame. No one seems concerned. A door opens. A bicycle with plastic streamers on the handlebars lies crushed and mangled. One of its wheels is still spinning. JACOB cries out but it is not his voice we hear. Rather it is a familiar unearthly roar. His whole body stiffens. As he rounds the corner he sees a figure, its head vibrating in endless terror. it is the same image he has seen before. JACOB screams. 
INT.  ROOM - NIGHT 
JACOB is wheeled into a tiny ROOM. A numer of "DOCTORS" are waiting. As they draw closer JACOB notices that something about them is not right. They bear a subtle resemblance to Bosch-like DEMONS, creatures of another world. JACOB tries to sit up but winces in pain. He cannot move. He tries to scream but no sound comes out. 
Chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling. They are lowered and attached with speed and efficiency to JACOB's arms and legs. He screams. 
JACOB Oh God! 
The "DOCTORS" laugh. There is the sound of a huge door closing. JACOB is left in semi-darkness. Suddenly a new group of "DOCTORS" emerges from the shadows. They are carrying sharp surgical instruments. They surround JACOB, their eyes glistening as bright as their blades. JACOB is panting and sweating in fear. One of the "DOCTORS" leans over JACOB. He gasps with horror. It is JEZZIE. 
JACOB JEZZIE! 
She pays no attention to him. He stares at her, THE CAMERA TILTING DOWN HER BODY. As it gets to her foot we see it is a decaying mass, swarming with maggots. The "DOCTORS" laugh. They take great pleasure in his suffering. Their voices are strange and not human. Each utterance contains a multitude of contradictory tones, sincere and compassionate, taunting and mocking at the same time. The confusion of meanings is a torment of its own. 
JACOB (continuing) Get me out of here. 
"DOCTOR" Where do you want to go? 
JACOB Take me home. 
"DOCTOR" Home? (they all laugh) This is your home. You're dead. 
JACOB Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead. 
"DOCTOR" What are you then? 
JACOB I'm alive. 
"DOCTOR" Then what are you doing here? 
JACOB I don't know. I don't know. (he struggles like an animal) This isn't happening. 
"DOCTOR" What isn't happening? 
JACOB Let me out of here! 
"DOCTOR" There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember? 
A "DOCTOR" approaches JACOB. As he turns, we notice with horror that he has no eyes or eye sockets. He extracts a long needle from his belt and positions it over JACOB's head. Like a divining rod it locates a particular point near the crown of his head. With a powerful thrust the "DOCTOR" shoves the needle into JACOB's skull and pushes it slowly into his brain. JACOB howls. 
EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT 
CUT RAPIDLY TO VIETNAM and a replay of flashes of the opening sequence of the film. SOLDIERS with bayonets are charging over rice paddies in the dark of the night. ONE OF THE SOLDIERS charges at JACOB with a long bayonet blade and jams it into his intestines. JACOB cries out. 
INT.  ROOM - NIGHT 
JACOB yells. 
JACOB Louis! I'm here! In here! 
INT.  JACOB'S ROOM - DAY 
LOUIS storms through JACOB's door followed by several NURSES and ORDERLIES. 
JACOB LOUIS! 
NURSE 1 You can't go in there! 
ORDERLY You're going to have to leave. 
LOUIS stares furiously at JACOB stretched out on the traction apparatus. He begins to yell. 
LOUIS Good God, Jake. What have they done? (he examines JACOB and screams at the NURSES) What is this, the Middle Ages? And they call this modern medicine. This is barbaric! Barbaric! (turning to JACOB) It's okay, Jake. It's not serious. I'll get you out of here. (yelling at the ORDERLY) What is this, the Inquisition? Why don't you just burn him at the stake and put him out of his misery? 
LOUIS charges over to the traction equipment and begins working the pulleys that suspend JACOB over the bed. The NURSES and ORDERLIES become instantly hysterical and start screaming. 
ORDERLY What the hell do you think ... ? 
LOUIS Don't you come near me. 
NURSE 2 You can't do that! 
LOUIS What is this, a prison? Stay back. 
NURSE 1 You can't. Call the police. 
One of the ORDERLIES lunges at LOUIS who swings back at him with one of the pulley chains. It just misses. 
LOUIS (to the ORDERLIES) You take one step and I'll wrap this around your neck. 
LOUIS lowers JACOB into a wheelchair while holding the others at bay. 
LOUIS (continuing) Hold on, Jake, we're getting out of here. 
NURSES and ORDERLIES part as he pushes him quickly from the room. 
OMIT 
INT.  CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - EVENING 
LOUIS helps JACOB over to an adjusting table in a room that, compared with the hospital, is comfortable and serene. He pushes a lever and the table rises to a vertical position. JACOB leans against it and rides it down to a horizontal position. Every moment is agony for him. 
LOUIS Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words. (JACOB barely hears them) Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you? 
JACOB (nearly whispering) Am I dead, Louis? (LOUIS leans over to hear) Am I dead? 
LOUIS (smiling) From a slipped disc? That'd be a first. 
JACOB I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis. 
LOUIS Well, I'll see what I can do about it. 
JACOB I've seen it. It's all pain. 
LOUIS (working on JACOB's spine like a master mechanic) You ever read Meister Eckart? (JACOB shakes his head "no") How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart? (LOUIS takes hold of JACOB's legs and yanks them swiftly) Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side. 
JACOB turns to his left. LOUIS shakes his head in dismay. 
LOUIS The other "right," okay? (he helps JACOB turn over) You're a regular basket case, you know that? (he moves JACOB's arm over his head) Eckart saw Hell, too. 
LOUIS positions JACOB's other arm, bends his legs, and then pushes down on his thigh. His spine moves with a cracking sound. JACOB groans. 
LOUIS (continuing) You know what he said? The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of your life; your memories, your attachments. They burn 'em all away. But they're not punish- ing you, he said. They're freeing your soul. Okay, other side. 
He helps JACOB and repositions him. Again he pushes and the spine cracks. 
LOUIS (continuing) Wonderful. So the way he sees it, if you're frightened of dying and hold- ing on, you'll see devils tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace then the devils are really angels freeing you from the earth. It's just a matter of how you look at it, that's all. So don't worry, okay? Relax. Wiggle your toes. 
JACOB's toes dance as LOUIS gives him a quick, unexpected jab to the lower vertebrae in his back. 
LOUIS (continuing) Perfect. We got it. (LOUIS pushes a lever and the table rises back up) Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand. 
JACOB What? By myself? 
LOUIS You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try. 
JACOB steps cautiously away from the table. He moves hesitantly, with deliberate restraint. LOUIS encourages him like a faith healer coaxing the lame. His first steps have an aura of the miraculous about them. JACOB walks slowly, without help. LOUIS smiles impishly. He looks like a giant cherub. 
LOUIS Hallelujah. 
LOUIS puts his arm around him. Then JACOB tries again, gradually rediscovering his balance and strength. With each step his confidence returns. LOUIS is pleased. Then, suddenly, without warning, JACOB turns and heads toward the door. 
LOUIS What are you doing? 
JACOB There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis. 
JEZZIE It's just me. 
JACOB Jezzie? 
JEZZIE Who else were you expecting? 
JACOB Let go! 
JEZZIE Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called? 
JACOB Stay away from me, Jez. 
JEZZIE I want to know. You tell me! 
JACOB You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news! 
He pushes her away and jumps out of the shower. 
CUT TO JACOB dressing and piling the last of his clothes into his suitcase. JEZZIE, in a robe, is watching him. 
JEZZIE Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that. 
JACOB I can do anything I want. 
She stares at him with confusion. THE PHONE RINGS. 
JACOB Don't! 
JEZZIE It might be for me. 
JACOB I'm not here. You haven't seen me. 
JEZZIE (picking up the receiver) Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what? (JACOB looks up) Vietnam? ... What experiments? 
JACOB lunges for the phone. 
JACOB Hello. This is Jacob Singer. (he listens with growing fascination) God almighty! ... Yes. Yes. Right. Where would you like to meet? (he listens) How will I know you. (JACOB seems uncomfortable) Okay. I'll be there. 
He hangs up the phone and stands silently for a moment. 
JEZZIE Who was that? 
JACOB A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him. 
JEZZIE How? 
JACOB I have no idea. (he thinks) I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God. 
JEZZIE How do you know he's telling the truth? 
JACOB stares at JEZZIE for several moments but does not respond. The 11:00 NEWS is coming on. JACOB's image can be seen on the screen. We hear the NEWSCASTER speaking. 
NEWSCASTER Leading the news tonight, a bizarre demonstration on the steps of the U.S. Army Recruiting Headquarters, in downtown Manhattan. Jacob Singer, an alleged Vietnam vet ... 
JACOB Alleged? Alleged? 
NEWSCASTER ... challenged the United States Army to admit conducting secret experi- ments involving hundreds of American soldiers during the Vietnam war. 
JEZZIE stares at the T.V., dumbfounded. JACOB takes his suitcase and hurries to the front door. He opens it a crack and peers into the hallway. JEZZIE runs after him. 
JEZZIE (almost threatening) Don't leave me, Jake. 
INT.  BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
JACOB gazes at JEZZIE for a moment and then hurries down the HALL. He stops at the stairwell and looks back. JEZZIE is still standing there. She is very angry. JACOB just stares at her for a moment and then disappears down the stairwell. 
EXT.  WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
JACOB is standing near the WESTSIDE HIGHWAY. GROUPS OF MEN in black leather jackets are crusing the area and look at JACOB with curiosity. One MAN in particular cruises by several times and then approaches him. 
MICHAEL Jacob? Hi. I'm Michael Newman. Friends call me Mike. 
JACOB is startled when he sees him. He is the same YOUNG MAN who has appeared throughout the film, assisting JACOB in moments of crisis. 
MICHAEL (continuing) Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight. 
JACOB I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me? 
MICHAEL Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors. 
A POLICE CAR passes them on the street. MICHAEL grabs JACOB's shoulder and turns him away nervously. 
MICHAEL (continuing) Come on, we're not safe around here. 
HUDSON RIVER PIER - NIGHT 
JACOB and MICHAEL are sitting on a deserted WEST SIDE PIER that juts into the Hudson River. JACOB is wide-eyed as he listens to MICHAEL's story. 
MICHAEL So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68. 
MICHAEL (continuing) I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it. 
JACOB Never? 
MICHAEL I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue. 
JACOB What is it? 
MICHAEL Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on. 
JACOB (fearful) I don't know. 
MICHAEL "Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh? (JACOB smiles, his mouth open) Stick out your tongue. (JACOB obeys as an eyedropper deposits a drop of liquid on the back of his tongue) That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax. 
JACOB One drop? 
MICHAEL It's strong stuff. 
JACOB stretches out on the bed. He stares up at the ceiling and examines its pock-marked lunar look. Long cracks and shallow craters erode the surface. It is an alien terrain. 
JACOB I think I'm falling asleep. 
MICHAEL Pleasant dreams. 
The words send a jolt through JACOB's body. He tries to get up but can't. He's frightened. 
JACOB I can't move. 
MICHAEL Just relax. 
JACOB What's happening? Help me. 
The ceiling begins to rumble. Cracks split wide open. Huge crevasses tear through the plaster. JACOB's world is crumbling. He stares in horror as DEMONIC FORMS attempt to surge through the rupture above him. Piercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the darkness. Hooved feet and pointed claws clamor to break through. 
JACOB (continuing) HELP ME! 
Instantly MICHAEL appears standing over him. He is holding the vial with the antidote. He draws an eyedropper full of the fluid and holds it over JACOB's mouth. 
MICHAEL Take it! 
JACOB fights him, but MICHAEL forces the entire contents of the eyedropper down his throat. JACOB gags. He tries to spit it out, but can't. 
Suddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks break off and collide like continental plates. The collisons wreak havoc on the DEMONS, chopping and dismembering them. Body parts fall from the ceiling like a Devil's rain. Horrible screams echo from the other side. 
MICHAEL (continuing) Don't fight it. It's your own mind. It's your own fears. 
Flashes of light and dark storm over JACOB's head, thundering like a war in the heavens. It is a scene of raw power and growing catastrophe. It builds in fury and rage until suddenly the ceiling explodes. JACOB's eyes stare into the formlessness expanding around him. All space is becoming a dark liquid void. 
Gradually the liquid grows bluer, clearer. There is an undulating sense to the imagery, a feeling of womb-like comfort. Strange lights appear and sparkle before us like sunlight on the ocean. JACOB is rushing upward, toward the surface. 
With the delirious sound of water giving way to air, JACOB breaks through. To his amazement, he finds himself floating out-stretched on shimmering sunlit water. Above him are clouds of such wondrous beauty that they cannot possibly be of the earth. Pillars of golden light reach down from the heavens creating a cathedral of light. It is a vision of heaven, a vast, almost mythic paradise. JACOB is awed. 
A sudden movement catches his attention. He looks over and sees MICHAEL standing before him. Only MICHAEL looks different. His face seems to radiate an inner light, a transcendental beauty. JACOB is nearly blinded by his presence and must shield his eyes to look at him. 
MICHAEL So, how you doin'? 
The casualness of the words catches JACOB by surprise. He sits up. To his shock and amazement, he finds that he is back in THE HOTEL ROOM. MICHAEL is standing at the foot of the bed. JACOB is totally disoriented. His eyes move slowly around the room, taking everything in. He doesn't speak. 
MICHAEL (continuing) It was better than you expected, huh? 
JACOB just stares at him for a while and then suddenly begins to laugh. It is a huge laugh, full of energy and life. 
MICHAEL (continuing) And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone. 
JACOB I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle. 
MICHAEL Better living through chemistry, that's my motto. 
EXT.  GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY 
JACOB and MICHAEL are walking through the STREETS OF GREENWICH VILLAGE. It is early MORNING and the sidewalks are bustling with PEOPLE. JACOB stares into their faces and beams when they smile back. MICHAEL enjoys JACOB's happiness. 
EXT.  WASHINGTON SQUARE - DAY 
JACOB and MICHAEL walk through WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK. 
JACOB It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there. 
MICHAEL Well that's good to know. 
JACOB Mike, it was real. It was glorious. 
MICHAEL Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back. 
JACOB I would have stayed there if I could. 
MICHAEL I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here. 
He points to two POLICEMEN on the far side of the SQUARE. 
JEZZIE Oh yeah? (her eyes twinkle suggestively) Try leavin' without me. 
JACOB laughs. JEZZIE doesn't. Unexpectedly she grabs JACOB and pushes him onto the bed. In seconds they are all over each other, their clothes flying in all directions. They seem as happy as could be. 
OMIT 
INT.  GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY 
JACOB enters GRAND CENTRAL STATION. He checks out all the PEOPLE around him. Not a DEMON in sight. Hurrying to the TICKET WINDOW he gets in line. The TICKET SELLER looks up. 
JACOB Chicago. One way. For tomorrow. 
SELLER How many? 
JACOB One. 
SELLER That'll be $119.75. 
JACOB pulls out MICHAEL's credit card. The SELLER rings it up. While he is waiting JACOB notices a POLICEMAN looking at him. The stare unsettles him. The SELLER hands JACOB his ticket. He takes it and hurries into the CROWD. Looking back he notices the POLICEMAN is following him. 
INT.  MEN'S ROOM - DAY 
JACOB enters the MEN'S ROOM. He hurries into one of the stalsls, drops his pants, and sits. He eyes the graffiti on the walls and then notices a wad of tissue stuffed into a hole between him and the next stall. It is moving. Suddenly the tissue falls to the floor. JACOB glances at the hole curiously and leans forward to examine it. He is shocked to see an eye staring back at him. 
JACOB Goddamn it! (he covers it with his hand. A pencil jabs his palm. He yells) Fucking pervert. 
Two lips form around the hole. A tongue wags obscenely. 
VOICE Dream on! 
JACOB (shocked) What?! 
The mouth is gone. JACOB hears the stall door fly open and feet running from the room. He jumps up and grabs his pants. He dashes out of the MEN'S ROOM. He hears footsteps and chases after them. 
INT.  GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY 
JACOB bursts into the MAIN TERMINAL. He sees someone rushing toward the main doors and speeds after him. HOMELESS PEOPLE, huddling along the corridors, watch as they run past. Escaping to the street, the MAN disappears in the holiday throngs. JACOB, crazed, stands gasping for breath. His fists dig into his coat pocket. Suddenly he feels something and seems surprised when MICHAEL's CARD emerges in his hands. 
OMIT 
INT.  SOHO LOFT BUILDING - EVENING 
JACOB runs up the stairs in a SOHO LOFT BUILDING. It is a dingy, industrial staircase, poorly lit. He reaches a door with MICHAEL's name painted on it in large black letters. He knocks loudly. There is no answer. He pounds on it. Another door opens on the floor above. A head sticks out. 
MAN You lookin' for Mike? 
JACOB (panting hard) Where is he? 
MAN Don't know. Hasn't picked his mail up in days. It's not like him. 
JACOB has a frenzied look in his eyes. He searches around the staircase and sees a pile of lumber stacked in a corner. He grabs a two-by-four and lunges at the door. 
MAN What the hell are you doing? 
JACOB doesn't answer. He smashes wildly at the door until the lock flies open. 
INT.  MICHAEL'S LOFT - EVENING 
JACOB charges into the dark space groping for a light. He finds it. The LOFT is a disaster area. Nothing is standing. JACOB runs from room to room. In the back he discovers a large private chemistry lab. Glass vials and bottles are shattered on the floor. 
JACOB rifles through the cabinets. A few bottles are intact but their labels mean nothing to him. 
He reaches for one cabinet and notices a reddish liquid oozing out from the bottom. He opens it. MICHAEL's severed head stares him in the face. It is smiling. 
A scream rings out as the MAN from upstairs sees what JACOB has seen. JACOB jumps back, trips, and falls over MICHAEL's headless body. It is lying sprawled across the floor. 
MAN Oh my God! 
JACOB stumbles to pull himself up. He is in a state of unrelieved panic. He runs past the MAN and spills out the doorr. He takes two and three stairs at a time, nearly flying to the street. 
EXT.  SOHO STREETS - NIGHT 
JACOB rushes into the icy air and runs wildly down the sidewalk as fast as his legs will move. With unexpected violence he charges into the side of a building. Over and over he hurls himself against it. He grabs for the bricks. His fingers insert themselves into the crevices. It is as though he is trying to merge with the wall. 
Suddenly JACOB turns and dashes into the street. A taxi is speeding toward him, its lights the only sign of life and warmth in the dark night. JACOB steps into its path. It is hard to tell if he is trying to stop the cab or waiting to be hit. The taxi screeches to a halt. JACOB stares at it a moment and then steps to get in. The DRIVER tries to pull off but JACOB yanks at the door and drags himself inside. 
INT.  TAXI - NIGHT 
Rain is beginning to fall. It streaks the windows. 
JACOB (barely audible) I'm going to Brooklyn. 
DRIVER Sorry, Mac. Not with me you're not. I get lost in Brooklyn. 
JACOB I know the way. 
JACOB reaches into his pants pocket, pulls out a twenty dollar bill, and hands it to the DRIVER. He takes it. 
JACOB (continuing) Look, this is all the money I've got in the world. Take me home and it's yours. 
STERN (he smiles) Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it? 
JACOB Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft. (STERN nods his head. They walk a moment in silence) I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos. 
STERN (looking at JACOB with affection) Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. (he pauses) Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with? 
JACOB (smiling coyly) I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady. 
STERN (with a fatherly demeanor) Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it. 
INT.  OFF CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
JACOB and PROFESSOR STERN are sitting at a quiet table in a nearly empty coffee shop. They are both fixing cups of tea, not speaking. Suddenly JACOB looks at STERN. 
JACOB I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean. (STERN looks at him questioningly) I need to know about ... demons. 
STERN (surprised) Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ? 
JACOB No. (he pauses a moment) I see them. 
STERN See them? (he smiles uncomforta- bly) What do you mean? Physically? 
JACOB (hesitantly) Yes. 
STERN pauses. He looks at JACOB. The intensity of his gaze is unsettling and JACOB reaches for his tea. The cup rattles. 
STERN I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob, (he pauses) this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now. 
JACOB I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life. 
A look of concern fills STERN's eyes. 
JACOB (continuing) Christ, I know how it sounds. 
STERN Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist? 
JACOB Yes. (suddenly uneasy) I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis. (he pauses uncomforta- bly) It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to. 
STERN I don't know what to say. 
JACOB I need your insight, your intuition. 
STERN sips his tea slowly. He is thinking. 
STERN Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit? 
JACOB I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense. (he pauses) Please help me. 
STERN (trying to be delicate) Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves. 
JACOB (disturbed) But I see them. 
STERN Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob. (he muses) You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint. 
JACOB Hell, you think I am? 
STERN I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing. 
JACOB gazes at his old friend and mentor, frustration blazing in his eyes. They are both surprised to see tears form and run down his cheek. JACOB reaches for a napkin and dries them quickly. STERN, uncomfortable in the face of emotion, turns away. 
ADDENDUM 2: THE PARTY AT DELLA'S 
Suddenly a strange and terrifying spectacle unfolds before him. The DANCERS undergo a shocking transformation, a full three- dimensional alteration of their physical forms. Clothes fuse to their bodies like new skin. Horns and tails emerge and grow like exotic genitalia, exciting a frenzy among the DANCERS. New appendages appear unfolding from their flesh. Dorsal fins protrude from their backs. Armored scales run in scallops down their legs. Tails entwine sensuously. Long tongues lick at the undersides of reptilian bellies. The metamorphosis holds a biological fascination. Bones and flesh mold into new forms of life, creatures of another world. 
CUT TO JACOB's face as it registers terror and disbelief. He stares at the DANCERS. They are perverse, corrupt aspects of their normal selves. He is mesmerized by JEZZIE. Her flesh has grown hard and wrinkled and has the markings of a snake. Her tongue, long and curled, darts in and out of her mouth repeatedly. Her eyes are thin and domineering. They lock JACOB in their gaze. He wants to stop, to run, but JEZZIE won't release him. 
JACOB grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision from them but it won't go away. The music throbs. His actions become spastic, almost delirious. His hysteria attracts the attention of the other DANCERS. 
A circle forms around JACOB and JEZZIE as their frenzy transcends the boundaries of dance and erupts into an almost orgiastic display. JACOB is out of control. His fury becomes a kind of exorcism, a desperate attempt to free himself from his body and his mind. 
CUT TO JACOB as his eyes pass beyond pain. The dark walls of the APARTMENT fade away. 
EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT 
Strange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness, outlined by a bright moon that is emerging from behind a large cloud. The faces are looking down and voices are speaking. 
VOICE He's burning up. 
VOICE Total delirium. 
VOICE He'll never make it. 
VOICE That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out. 
VOICE Push 'em back. 
JACOB (V.O.) (crying weakly) Help me! 
His eyes focus on the moon. Rings of light emanate from it filling the sky with their sparkling brilliance. The rings draw us forward with a quickening intensity that grows into exhilarating speed. The rush causes them to flash stroboscopically and produce a dazzling, almost sensual, surge of color. The display is spectacular and compelling. A voice can be heard in the distance. 
JEZZIE wraps herself around his shivering body and warms him with her own. The image seems tender and comforting until we notice JEZZIE's tongue darting nervously in and out. It looks strangely like a snake's. 
ADDENDUM 6: THE HOSPITAL 
The RESIDENT injects the serum into JACOB's veins while two ORDERLIES hold him still. JACOB barely struggles. His eyes fixate on the EMERGENCY ROOM WALL. It is white and sterile. Within moments it begins to emit a reddish glow. JACOB watches with astonishment as the wall's two-dimensional surface separates into three-dimensional planes. The solid surface gives way to a DARK CHAMBER that was not there before. 
Out of the transmuted space CREATURES begin to form. Bosch-like DEMONS with horns and tails, undeniably of another world. Slowly several of them emerge from the wall and approach JACOB. They look like parodies of doctors and nurses, wearing traditional hospital gowns. Without a word they wheel him through the space where the wall had been. JACOB tries to scream but no sound comes out. 
INT.  HELL - NIGHT 
The DARK CHAMBER is filled with mournful CREATURES being led by DEMONS through a series of CORRIDORS. No one fights or struggles. JACOB's stretcher is moved through the darkness. He tries to sit up but is forced back down. He is obviously drugged. 
JACOB is wheeled into a tiny CHAMBER. A number of DEMONS are waiting for him. Chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling. They are lowered and attached with speed and efficiency to JACOB's arms and legs. The devices are manipulated smoothly and JACOB is lifted off the stretcher. The chains retract, stretching him spread-eagle in the air. He screams loudly. 
JACOB Oh God! 
The DEMONS laugh. There is the sound of a huge door closing. JACOB is left in darkness. The darkness is hallucinogenic. Fires appear beyond the boundaries of the wall; images of Dante's Inferno, souls of the dead in endless torment. JACOB is but one of countless beings sharing a vastness of torment. His own screams for help are lost in the magnitude of voices crying. 
Suddenly, out of the meancing shadows, a contingent of DEMONS emerges. They are carrying sharp surgical instruments. They surround JACOB, their eyes glistening as bright as their blades. JACOB is panting and sweating with fear. For an instant, one of the DEMONS looks like JEZZIE. JACOB calls out to her. 
JACOB Jezzie! Help me! 
The DEMONS laugh as she changes form. They take great pleasure in his suffering. Their voices are strange and not human. Each utterance contains a multitude of contradictory tones, sincere and compassionate, taunting and mocking at the same time. The confusion of meanings is a torment of its own. 
ADDENDUM 7: JACOB'S BEDROOM 
INT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM 
JACOB is lying on the floor of his BEDROOM doing exercises for his back. He has several days' growth of beard and does not look well. His mind is drifting and only the occasional pain in his back reminds him of what he is doing. JEZZIE can be heard vacuuming the carpet in the LIVING ROOM. Suddenly the door swings open. The wail of the vacuum cleaner causes JACOB to tense. His eyes drift down from the ceiling. JEZZIE vacuums around him and seems insensitive to his presence. 
JEZZIE shoves the vacuum cleaner under the bed and hits something. JACOB tightens. She looks and is shocked to discover a can of gasoline and boxes of kitchen matches. It takes her a second to understand the implications of what she has found. JACOB is ready when she begins yelling. 
JEZZIE You're completely off your rocker, you know that? You'd think you fell on your head instead of your back. What are you planning to do, burn down the apartment along with your demons? 
She begins to remove the gasoline can. 
JACOB (yelling) Don't you touch it. (he glares at her) 
JEZZIE lets go of the can and grabs the vacuum. She moves it furiously across the carpet. Suddenly JACOB sees her tongue darting in and out, unconsciously. She looks strange, not human. JACOB freezes. He yells out. 
JACOB Who are you? 
The sound of the vacuum cleaner drowns out his voice. He yells again. JEZZIE sees him and turns off the machine. His voice booms out. 
JACOB (continuing) Who the hell are you? 
JEZZIE ignores the question and turns the vacuum cleaner back on. JACOB rolls over and pulls out the plug. 
JACOB Why won't you answer me? 
JEZZIE (angry) Cause you know goddamn well who I am. 
JACOB I don't know you. 
JEZZIE You've lived with me for two years. 
JACOB That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana. 
JEZZIE What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy? 
JACOB You know goddamn well what I mean. 
JEZZIE You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you. 
JACOB Well leave then. Go to Hell. 
JEZZIE (furious) You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing! 
She storms out of the room, kicking the vacuum cleaner as she goes. JACOB can see flashes of her through the open crack of the bedroom door. Occasional curses and epithets hurl through the opening along with a flood of tears. 
JACOB catches glimpses of her as she grabs her coat from the hall closet and as she pulls her money out of the desk drawer. He can see the lamp as she shoves it to the floor and hears it shatter as she stomps on it with her foot. There is a blur as she heads to the front door and a deafening bang as she leaves. 
JACOB's eyes drift up to the ceiling. They hardly blink. He stares at the plaster, chipped and cracked, above him. Suddenly the cracks begin to move. JACOB jumps up. A DEMON is materializing over his head. JACOB yells and grabs hold of the extension pole for the vacuum cleaner. With a furious cry he begins jamming it at the ceiling. Rather than blot out the evolving image his attack helps to define it. JACOB slams harder. Plaster and wood lath cover the floor. The DEMON is gone. Panting hard, JACOB reaches for matches and the gasoline can. He stops and stares at them with great intensity. 
ADDENDUM 8: THE ANTIDOTE SEQUENCE 
The ceiling begins to rumble. Cracks split wide open. Huge crevasses tear through the plaster. JACOB's world is crumbling. He stares in horror as DEMONIC FORMS attempt to surge through the rupture above him. Piercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the darkness. Hooved feet and pointed claws clamor to break through. 
JACOB (continuing) HELP ME! 
Instantly MICHAEL appears standing over him. He is holding the vial with the antidote. He draws an eyedropper full of the fluid and holds it over JACOB's mouth. 
MICHAEL Take it! 
JACOB fights him but MICHAEL forces the entire contents of the eyedropper down his throat. JACOB gags. He tries to spit it out, but can't. 
Suddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks break off and collide with one another like continental plates. The collisions wreak havoc on the DEMONS, chopping and dismembering them. Body parts fall from the ceiling like a Devil's rain. Horrible screams echo from the other side. 
Flashes of light and dark storm over JACOB's head, thundering like a war in the heavens. It is a scene of raw power and growing catastrophe. It builds in fury and rage until suddenly the ceiling explodes. 
JEZZIE Jake, don't leave me! 
JACOB throws the chair at the floor, opens the door, and hurries into the HALLWAY. JEZZIE scurries around the chair and runs to the door. She yells after him, but he is already gone. 
ADDENDUM 10: THE END OF THE MOVIE 
INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT 
JACOB stoops in front of the APARTMENT door and reaches his hand underneath a section of the hallway carpet. It comes back with a key. He inserts it into the lock and gently opens the door. 
JACOB (calling out) Hello. It's me. 
INT.  SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The lights are on and the APARTMENT looks comfortable and cozy. 
JACOB Hello? Is anyone home? Jed? Elie? Dad- dy's here. 
There is still no answer. JACOB is surprised. He walks into the LIVING ROOM and then the KITCHEN. No one is around. He walks into his old BEDROOM and then the BOYS' ROOM. He is surprised to hear footsteps coming down the hall. He turns around and calls out. 
JACOB Sarah, is that you? I hope you don't mind. I needed to come home. 
JACOB is startled to see JEZZIE enter the room. She does not seem to be her usual self. She seems larger, more imposing. 
JEZZIE Hello, Jake. I knew you'd come here in the end. 
JACOB is nervous. 
JACOB Where's Sarah? Where are the boys? 
JEZZIE Sit down, Jake. 
JACOB Where are they? 
JEZZIE Sit down! 
JACOB No! What's going on? Where's my family? 
JEZZIE It's over, Jake. It's all over. 
JACOB Where have they gone? 
JEZZIE Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished. 
JEZZIE stares at JACOB with a frightening, powerful glare. Her lips snarl. Her tongue begins darting in and out, only now it is not a nervous habit but a conscious act. JACOB's body feels the first waves of an inner tremor. His legs are shaking. 
JACOB What's going on? 
JEZZIE smiles at him. Her tongue wags and suddenly shoots from her mouth beyond human extension. JACOB recoils. 
JACOB (whispering to himself) This isn't happening. 
JEZZIE Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer. 
JEZZIE's head begins to tighten and squeeze, as though she is suffering from cramps. JACOB watches in horror as her skull gives birth to pointed horns. 
JACOB Oh God! 
JEZZIE What's wrong, Jake? (she mocks him) Forget to take your antidote? 
JACOB (screaming) Goddamn you! 
JEZZIE (smiling and then laughing) I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise. (she laughs with a hu- miliating tone) A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up. 
JACOB's eyes are locked on JEZZIE. His mouth is wide open. His body is shaking badly. He tries to back away from her but his legs barely move. 
JEZZIE There is nowhere to run, Jacob. You're home. 
Suddenly the pictures on the wall crash to the floor. Plaster from the ceiling breaks off in huge chunks and slams to the carpet. Light bulbs and lamps explode. JACOB runs to the door. He pulls it open and screams. He is on the edge of a fiery abyss. JEZZIE laughs with a new intensity of demonic force. JACOB spins around. 
JACOB WHO ARE YOU? 
JEZZIE How many times have you asked me that? How many times? 
JACOB TELL ME, DAMN YOU! 
JEZZIE (with consummate power) You know who I am. 
Suddenly JEZZIE reaches for her tongue and pulls at it with all her might. It is an act of total, unrelieved grotesqueness. With each yank the horror grows as JEZZIE literally pulls herself inside out before JACOB's eyes. 
The emerging creature is JEZZIE transfigured, a demonic presence beyond anything we have seen before. It is black and covered with a thick oozing slime. Its head, still recognizable as JEZZIE, is rodent-like, with piercing green eyes and terrible horns protruding from its brow. Its powerful arms have long spiked claws. Its feet are cloven hooves. Extending from its back is a long, thick, muscular tail that whips around the room with devastating force. It throws furniture crashing through the air. 
A sudden cracking sound emerges from the DEMON's back. Dark forms penetrate the air. JACOB is breathless as huge wings unfold and spread out to the living room walls. The sound of their flapping is deafening. The walls shatter from their blows. As they crumble darkness appears on the other side. There are no other rooms. The VOID envelops them. The INFERNO emerges in all directions. The DEMON roars. 
DEMON (with JEZZIE's voice) Still love me, Jake? (it laughs and reaches out to him) COME! 
CUT TO JACOB's face. He has gone beyond fear. An intensity of rage is building in him that we have not witnessed before. His whole image seems transformed by it. He glows like a volcano before it erupts. 
Suddenly he explodes. The full fury of the Ladder detonates inside him. He yells at the DEMON with all his might.

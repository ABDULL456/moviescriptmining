SUPERED TITLES READ: More of this is true than you would believe. 
FADE IN: 
2   ...CLOSE ON A MAN'S FACE...                                      2 He is STARING at us with fixed concentration. He is sweating slightly in the summer heat. We hold for a moment. Silence, apart from the soft swish of an unseen ceiling fan. WIDE SHOT - the Man, wearing military uniform, sits at his desk in his office, still staring straight ahead. SUPERED TITLES appear, reading: General Putkin, United States Army Intelligence SED. Arlington, Virginia. 1983. The General's assistant, LIEUTENANT BOONE, sits at his desk, working. After a moment Putkin seems to come to a decision. 
GENERAL PUTKIN 
(SOLEMNLY) Boone? 
LIEUTENANT BOONE Yes General? 
GENERAL PUTKIN I'm going into the next office. 
LIEUTENANT BOONE Yes sir. 
The General stands up, smooths down his uniform, steps out from behind his desk and begins to walk. Boone watches, with some trepidation, as the General increases his pace. He quickens to a jog, his face set with determination. 
He breaks into a run... 
Then he slams into the WALL of the office, rebounds and lies splayed on the floor. He stares up at the wall balefully. 
GENERAL PUTKIN Damn it! 
3   EXT. FORT BRAGG - DAY                                          3 
General Putkin is being driven in a jeep through the vast military base. He has a band-aid over his injured nose. SUPERED TITLES read: Special Forces Command Centre, Fort Bragg, North Carolina. 
GENERAL PUTKIN (O.S.) I have been having ideas, gentlemen. Challenging ideas. And when I thought about these ideas I thought about who in the U.S Army would be most receptive to my challenging ideas. 
The Jeep pulls up at the SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE. The General gets out, a brief case in his hand and surveys the centre. 
GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D) (O.S.) 
(CONT'D) Which section of the military is always straining to reach the peak of their physical and mental capabilities? 
4   INT. SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE - DAY                       4 
General Putkin stands in front of a room full of seated 
SPECIAL FORCES OFFICERS. 
GENERAL PUTKIN You are, gentlemen. Special Forces. The assembled Officers nod modestly. 
GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D) I want to talk to you about Mind Wars, gentlemen. War...With... 
MINDS... His audience stare at him. With a flourish he produces a BENT FORK from his briefcase. 
GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D) How'd you like to be able to do this? What if you could teach soldiers to do this? Would you be interested? Silence. 
(CONTINUED) 
4   CONTINUED:                                                 4 
GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D) (changing tack) Or, or let's say you have a unit operating outside the protection of mainline units. What happens if someone gets hurt? How do you deal with that? He surveys the blank faces. 
GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D) Psychic healing! Protect the unit with hands-off healing. Using the mind to heal. Silence. Putkin senses he is not convincing his audience. 
GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D) Let's talk about time! What if time is not a point but a space and at any one instant we can be anywhere in that space! (Laughing) Physicists go nuts when I say that! Silence. He is growing desperate. 
GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D) Animals! Stopping the hearts of animals! This is the idea I'm coming to you with. You have access to animals right? Special Forces look like they've had enough. A tough looking officer - MAJOR JIM HOLTZ - stirs. 
MAJOR HOLTZ No sir. We don't have access to animals. 
5   EXT. SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE - DAY                   5 
A dejected General Putkin climbs back into his jeep. Lieutenant Boone, in the driving seat, looks at him with sympathy. 
LYN CASSADY We...don't...divulge. 
21   INT. LYN'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER                               21 
Bob and Lyn are talking, passing a bottle of Scotch backwards and forwards between them. Both are drunk. 
LYN CASSADY Okay. Let me ask you something. What color were the chairs in the hotel bar? 
BOB 
(BEAT) Uh...? 
(CONTINUED) 
21   CONTINUED:                                                21 
LYN CASSADY You were in there for hours. What color were the chairs? 
BOB Um...brown? 
LYN CASSADY They were green. How many lights are there in this room? Bob starts to look around. 
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D) A Super Soldier wouldn't need to look. He would just know. 
BOB A Super Soldier? 
LYN CASSADY A Jedi Warrior. He would know where all the lights were. He could walk through a room and tell you how many power outlets there were. People are walking around with their eyes closed. At Level One we were trained to instantly absorb all details. 
BOB 
(BEAT) What's a Jedi Warrior? 
LYN CASSADY You're looking at one. 
BOB You're a Jedi Warrior? 
LYN CASSADY That's correct. 
BOB What does that...? I don't think 
I... 
LYN CASSADY 
(PATIENTLY) I'm Sergeant First Class Lyn Cassady, Special Forces, retired. In the eighties I was trained at Fort Bragg in a secret initiative code-named Project Jedi. The objective of the project was to create Super Soldiers.

LYN CASSADY (CONT'D) Soldiers with Super Powers. We were the first generation of the New Earth Army. 
BOB 
(BEAT) You've got super powers? 
LYN CASSADY That's correct. 
BOB Hold on, let me...let me just... He takes out his NOTEBOOK, fumbling, trying to get into journalist mode. 
BOB (CONT'D) Okay, so, so you're saying you were a Psychic Spy, like Lacey? 
LYN CASSADY We prefer the term Remote Viewer. 
BOB How does that work? 
LYN CASSADY Different Jedi had different techniques. Mel Landau used to visualize packing all his cares and worries in a little suitcase, to clear his mind. Steve Cuttle used to read Bible verse... 
BOB What about you? Lyn thinks about it. 
LYN CASSADY Well, I find drinking helps. Also if I'm listening to classic rock music. 
BOB Yeah? (Beat) Like who? 
LYN CASSADY What's this? 
BOB What? Nothing. I was just doodling. Lyn examines Bob - something DIFFERENT IN HIS ATTITUDE. 
BOB (CONT'D) What's the matter? 
LYN CASSADY 
(BEAT) Nothing. He considers for a moment, struggling with himself, then seems to reluctantly come to a decision. He reaches into the bag on his bed and pulls out a dog-eared BOOK. He hands it to Bob. Bob examines the book - on the cover is a picture of Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man and the title Pentagon Report 92245. The New Earth Army Manual. Bob stares at the book. He opens the first page and reads...

21   CONTINUED: (6)                                         21 
BOB (V.O.) 
(READING) The U.S Army doesn't really have any serious alternative than to be Wonderful! Bob looks at the DISCLAIMER at the bottom of the page. 
BOB(V.O.) (CONT'D) 
(READING) This does not represent the official position of the United States Army at this time. Bob looks up at Lyn who nods gravely. 
LYN CASSADY You wanted to know who Bill Django was? (Beat) He's the man who wrote that book. 
22   EXT. EXPRESSWAY - IRAQ - MORNING                          22 
Lyn's CAR roars down the expressway into Southern Iraq, passing A TANK which sits by the road-side. 
23   I/E. CAR - MORNING                                        23 Lyn drives. A hung-over Bob sits reading the New Earth Army Manual. 
BOB 
(READING) The New Earth Army is a banner under which the forces of good can gather. The courage and nobility of the Warrior, blended with the spirituality of the Monk. 
24   EXT. ROAD - DAY                                           24 
The car passes oil fields, beyond the buildings thinning out into the desert. 
BOB The Jedi Warrior will follow in the footsteps of the great Imagineers of the past - Jesus Christ, Lao Tse Tung, Walt Disney... 
25   I/E. CAR - DAY                                            25 Bob is still reading.

BOB 
(READING) The role of The New Earth Army is to RESOLVE CONFLICT world-wide. Jedis will parachute into war zones, utilizing sparkly eyes technique, carrying symbolic flowers and animals, playing indigenous music and words of peace... INSERT: An illustration of a SOLDIER CARRYING A LAMB and some LILIES - with what appears to be some kind of loudspeaker strapped to his shoulder. 
BOB (CONT'D) What's the sparkly eyes technique? Lyn raises his shades and twinkles his eyes at Bob for a moment. 
BOB (CONT'D) Okay. 
LYN CASSADY You see it? 
BOB I think so. (Beat) Lyn? 
LYN CASSADY Yeah? 
BOB Who is this Bill Django? Lyn draws on his cigarette thoughtfully. 
LYN CASSADY I don't know where to begin. 
26   EXT. VIETNAM - DAY - THE PAST                              26 
LOW ANGLE - a YOUNG BILL DJANGO - military buzz cut and all - trips out of a HOVERING HELICOPTER and falls, head- first down towards us. WE FREEZE FRAME on his YELLING FACE just before it hits the camera. 
27   INT. CAR - AS BEFORE                                       27 
Lyn exhales smoke.

33   EXT. POOL - DAY                                           33 
FOUR PEOPLE are floating on their backs breathing rapidly and loudly. Each one is supported by a partner. Bill, his buzz-cut growing out, floats amongst them, sobbing uncontrollably. TITLES READ: Reichian Rebirthing, San Jose. 
34   EXT. HILL - DAY                                           34 
A PLATINUM HAIRED WOMAN is leading a GROUP OF RUNNERS, including Bill, down the hill. They run in an odd way - prancing like horses, their eyes closed, arms raised, smiling ecstatically. TITLES READ Beyond Jogging Movement, Stockton. One of the group runs into a tree. 
35   INT. ROOM - DAY                                           35 
Bill lies on his side on a gurney, his hair longer now. We can't see what is being done to him, but he is sobbing uncontrollably once again. TITLES READ Higher Essence Colonic Irrigation Therapy, Monterey. 
36   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                          36 
LONG SHOT - A GROUP OF BARE-CHESTED MEN, including BILL, stand on the roof of the house. TITLES READ The Whole Man Movement - Auburn. A LEADER gives Bill a signal and he jumps off, falls fifteen foot to the road below. He hurts himself quite badly. 
37   INT. ESALEN INSTITUTE - DAY                               37 
Bill sits amongst a large MEDITATION GROUP, long-haired and bearded, indistinguishable now from the San-Francisco Bay area Hippies all around him. TITLES READ: Esalen Institute for the Advancement of Human Potential, Big Sur. 
(CONTINUED) 
37   CONTINUED:                                                  37 
ARROWS POINT at various MEDITATORS around the hall, identifying them as BOB DYLAN, GEORGE HARRISON and HENRY 
MILLER. Bill senses someone staring at him and glances over to the Meditator next to him - Aviator shades, a baseball cap pulled low, empty cigarette holder clenched between his teeth. The Meditator continues to stare intently at him. Then opens his coat to reveal the Magnum .45 strapped to his chest. Bill smiles nervously. An ARROW identifies the gunman as 
HUNTER S. THOMPSON. 
BOB (V.O.) Bill disappeared into the New Age Movement for six years. Bill feels Thompson staring at him. He smiles nervously. 
38   EXT. FORT BRAGG - MAIN GATES - THE PAST - DAY               38 
It's 1980. Bill walks down the road towards the entrance gates. His long hair is braided. He has an EYE painted on his forehead. 
BOB (V.O.) Like all Shamen before him, he had traversed the wilderness. Now he was returning to his people, a changed man. The SENTRIES at the gate check Bill's PASS suspiciously. 
BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) He brought with him his confidential report - The New Earth Army Manual. The Gates swing open and Bill passes through. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
39   EXT. DESERT - DAY                                           39 
Lyn crouches revolving a curious aluminium CONE towards the sun. Bob sits by the car, reading the manual. He looks up, watches Lyn. 
BOB 
(BEAT) Does it direct your powers? 
(CONTINUED) 
39   CONTINUED:                                                  39 
LYN CASSADY What? 
BOB The cone. Does it direct your psychic powers or something? 
LYN CASSADY No. 
BOB What does it do? Lyn takes some BURGERS out of a cooler box and puts them into the cone. 
LYN CASSADY It cooks supper. He examines the stove approvingly. 
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D) Solar. Utilizing the power of the universe - no pollution, totally renewable. This is like New Earth Army technology. Bob picks up the Manual and starts to read. Lyn watches him. 
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D) Pretty mind-blowing, isn't it? First time I read it, I was like...what the fuck? 
BOB Yes. (Beat) But... He stops. 
LYN CASSADY What? 
BOB Nothing. 
LYN CASSADY Go on - what? 
BILL DJANGO I'd like us to begin this with a mantra. If we could all breathe in and then out, holding a long "eeeeee." The OFFICERS stare at him. There are sniggers. Bill stares them down. 
BILL DJANGO (CONT'D) Breathe in...(they comply) and out... 
OFFICERS 
(EMBARRASSED) 
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ee. They finish. Bill nods, smiling, stares around at them. 
BILL DJANGO We are a Hollow Army, gentlemen. Vietnam has crushed our soul. We are traumatized and melancholic. We are ashamed. That is why I have brought you to this place of Sanctuary. Here we can mend our wounds and dream our dreams. My dream is of an America that will lead the world to paradise, an America that no longer has an exploitative view of natural resources, that no longer promotes consumption at all costs. I believe this is America's destiny.

BILL DJANGO (CONT'D) But to achieve it we must become the first Superpower to develop super powers. We must create Warrior Monks - men and women who can fall in love with everyone, sense plant auras, pass through walls, stop saying mindless cliches and see into the future. I want you to JOIN me in this vision. (Beat) Be ALL you can BE. Bill finishes. We TRACK along the OFFICERS' FACES - really not sure what to do or say. We reach one officer who looks like Lee Marvin. This is BRIGADIER GENERAL DEAN HOPGOOD. His eyes are shining with excitement. 
BOB (V.O.) Amongst Bill's audience that night was Brigadier General Dean Hopgood, from the Defense Intelligence Agency. For some time the General had been concerned about information he had been receiving about Soviet research into psychic powers. 
44   EXT. POOL - DAY - THE PAST                                44 
Wearing trunks, the Brigadier General lounges by his pool, engrossed in a PAPER-BACK BOOK titled Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain. 
BOB (V.O.) According to some stories the Soviets were psychically spying on American bases and had designed "psychotronic generators" - machines capable of bombarding the President with negative energy. 
45   INT. LABORATORY - DAY - THE PAST                          45 
Two DIABOLICAL-LOOKING RUSSIAN SCIENTISTS are wiring up some KITTENS to a MACHINE. 
BOB (V.O.) They were also conducting sadistic experiments to see whether animals had psychic powers. 
46   ANOTHER LABORATORY                                        46 Another DIABOLICAL SCIENTIST is wiring up the KITTENS' 
MOTHER.

BOB (V.O.) Could they, for instance, telepathically detect that their babies were distressed? 
47   FIRST LABORATORY                                          47 With a gloating smile one of the Scientists approaches one of the KITTENS with a lit CIGARETTE. The kitten gives a pitiful MEW as the Scientists LOOMS over it. 
48   EXT. POOL - DAY - THE PAST                                48 
Brigadier General Hopgood can't read on. 
BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD Sick bastards... 
49   INT. OFFICE - DAY - THE PAST                              49 
Brigadier General Hopgood is briefing two senior Pentagon 
OFFICIALS. 
OFFICIAL But why did the Soviets begin this type of research? 
BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD Well sir, it looks like they heard about our attempt to telepathically communicate with one of our nuclear subs - the Nautilus - while it was under the Polar cap. 
OFFICIAL 
(BEAT) What attempt? 
BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD There was no attempt, sir. It seems the story was a French hoax. But the Russians think the story about the story being a French hoax is just a story sir. 
SECOND OFFICIAL So, they've started psi research because they thought we were doing psi research, when in fact we weren't doing psi research? 
(CONTINUED) 
49    CONTINUED:                                                    49 
BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD Yes sir. But now that they are doing psi research, we're going to have to do psi research, sir. We can't afford to have the Russians leading the field in the paranormal. The Officials consider this gravely. 
55   EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY - MUCH LATER                          55 
A sweating Bob sits in the shadow of the car, tossing a COIN. Lyn sits smoking. 
LYN WHEATON Heads. 
BOB (checking the coin) Right. He tosses again. 
LYN WHEATON Heads.

BOB 
(CHECKING) Right. He tosses again. 
BOB (CONT'D) What's your record at this? 
LYN WHEATON Two hundred and sixty four. Tails. 
BOB 
(CHECKING) Right. That's pretty... He stops, listening. We hear the sound of an approaching ENGINE. The two men turn to see a WHITE PICK-UP TRUCK approaching. 
BOB (CONT'D) (scrambling to his 
FEET) Oh thank Christ. Bob scuttles into the middle of the road, waving frantically. The pick-up slows and pulls over. A YOUNG IRAQI MAN looks out at them. 
BOB (CONT'D) Can you help us? We drove into a rock. Could you take us to a town or someplace? Smiling, the Iraqi gestures to the back of the pick-up. 
BOB (CONT'D) 
(RELAXING) Thank you! Thanks so much! He grabs his case and climbs up onto the back of the truck. Lyn stares at the driver, then, with a sigh picks up his bag and follows Bob. 
56   EXT. DESERT ROAD DAY - BACK OF TRUCK                      56 
As the Truck bumps off down the road, Bob and Lyn sit down and find themselves facing TWO YOUNG IRAQI MEN. 
BOB Hi! Hello there. Thanks so much for this. The two Young Men smile in a friendly fashion. 
(CONTINUED) 
56   CONTINUED:                                                 56 
BOB (CONT'D) 
(LAUGHING) Don't know if we would have lasted much longer. Phew! One of the Young Men nods, smiling. He reaches casually forward and takes Lyn's BAG from him. Lyn just sits there, resigned as the Young Man roots through the contents. 
BOB (CONT'D) 
(OBLIVIOUS) Yeah, it gets pretty hot out here, huh? The Young Man takes out a ROCK COMPILATION CD from Lyn's bag and inspects it. 
YOUNG IRAQI (to the other) Deep Purple. They laugh. 
BOB (laughing too) Oh, you speak English? Great. Deep Purple. Right. You guys like Deep Purple? You like rock or, or... He suddenly notices the Young Iraqi is holding a HANDGUN. The Driver leans out the window and shouts something over the roar of the engine. The Young Man next to Lyn takes off his scarf and starts to blindfold Lyn with it. 
BOB (CONT'D) (smile fading) Lyn? Is this...is this...? 
LYN CASSADY 
(WEARILY) Yeah. 
57   INT. ROOM - NIGHT                                          57 
Bob and Lyn, their hands tied, sit on a mattress in the otherwise empty room, lit by a shaft of moonlight from the small window above them. From next door comes the faint sound of a period song playing. Bob is losing it. 
BOB We're going to die! I'm going to be killed by Al Qaeda! 
(CONTINUED) 
57   CONTINUED:                                                57 
From the next room we hear the Young Iraqis start to sing along to the track, laughing. Lyn listens. 
Bob thinks about this then raises his hands to choke Lyn. Lyn THROWS him - sailing through the air. He crashes down into the floor behind Lyn. 
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D) See? I hardly moved. Physics wise there's not much going on. It's the psychic energy that's important. (Beat) You okay? 
BOB (in pain) Sharp...edges... 
LYN CASSADY (helping him up) You felt fear didn't you? Before hand? Bob massages his back, impressed despite himself. 
BOB Yes. 
LYN CASSADY Would you say that level of fear was abnormal for you? Bob thinks about this. 
BOB I don't know. I was pretty terrified anyway but the fear I felt on the run-up to the choking did seem, you know, unusual. 
LYN CASSADY 
(PLEASED) You know why? It wasn't you. It was me. I was inside your head. Fighting with the Mind. Suddenly the door opens and one of the Young Iraqis comes in, smiling. 
YOUNGER IRAQI Okay. We go. 
58   EXT. DESERT - EARLY MORNING                              58 
The White Pick-Up bounces over the sand. Bob and Lyn sit in the back with one of the Young Iraqis, who has Lyn's back-pack. 
BOB 
(SOFTLY) I'm sorry I freaked out, Lyn.

58   CONTINUED:                                                 58 
LYN CASSADY That's okay. You learnt a lesson. "Whatever you fear most has no power - it is your fear that has power." 
BOB 
(IMPRESSED) Huh. 
LYN CASSADY Oprah. 
BOB Uhuh. (Beat) You really don't work for DeWitts? 
LYN CASSADY Just my cover. 
BOB 
(BEAT) Gus Lacey said you ran a dance studio. That was just cover too, right? 
LYN CASSADY No. I do run a dance school. I love dance. 
BOB Oh. Okay. (Beat) And you're really on a mission out here? 
LYN CASSADY In time, Bob. 
BOB 
(BEAT) Were you just kidding me back there - about me having some Jedi in me? 
LYN CASSADY We learn to recognize our own kind after a while. You ever dream about flying? 
BOB Yes. 
LYN CASSADY That's one of the signs. 
BOB Do you really think so? 
(CONTINUED) 
58   CONTINUED: (2)                                            58 
LYN CASSADY Don't you? Haven't you always really felt you were different? Bob considers this. 
BOB Yes. Yes I have. 
LYN CASSADY That's the way it is for us. We're the ones who don't fit in as kids. 
Lyn shrugs, embarrassed.   Bill nods. 
BILL DJANGO (CONT'D) You've gotta free your feet before you can free your mind, Lyn. 
LYN CASSADY 
(EMBARRASSED) Not much of a dancer sir. Bill examines Lyn's face through narrowed eyes. 
BILL DJANGO But that isn't true is it Lyn? You can dance. It's just someone told you not to. 
63   BEDROOM - 1965                                            63 A TWELVE YEAR OLD LYN - is dancing away to a track on the radio. His FATHER weaves drunkenly past the door and stops, watching.

BILL DJANGO Well, I'm your commanding officer Lyn, and I'm ordering you to let the dance out! Lyn starts to dance with a little more abandon. 
BILL DJANGO (CONT'D) C'mon goddamit! DANCE! Let it go! Let it all go! Lyn starts to go for it. And it's true - he CAN dance. 
BILL DJANGO (CONT'D) (with approval) Welcome to the Heroes Journey Lyn. Lyn smiles shyly. 
BILL DJANGO (CONT'D) (to the room) Okay remember everyone, we don't officially exist as a unit so I'm afraid there's no coffee budget. Bring your own coffee. Oh, and no solid food for the first week. As the track continues we...

MONTAGE SEQUENCE BEGINS 
66   EXT. FORT BRAGG - DAY                                     66 
UNIFORMED SOLDIERS march double time across the parade deck. 
SPECIAL FORCES TROOPS "I don't know but I've been told Eskimo Pussy is mighty cold..." 
67   EXT. - DAY - JEDI WARRIORS                                67

JEDI WARRIORS Ommmm... 
68   INT. MESS HALL - DAY                                      68 
Soldiers shovel in mouthfuls of creamed potato and steak.

70   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                          70 
The Jedis stand watching a JEEP driving down a course marked out on the field. 
71   INT. INSIDE THE JEEP - DAY                                71 
Bill sits next to a nervous JEDI TRAINEE who is driving. The Jedi is BLINDFOLDED. 
BILL DJANGO 
(CALMLY) Okay, you're doing very well. Now feel the next bend... 
72   EXT. ON THE FIELD - DAY                                   72 
Scotty, Larry and Lyn sit focusing on a wall of SMALL WOODEN CUPBOARDS. Each cupboard has a letter and number printed on its door. 
BILL DJANGO 
A-9. The three men focus on the cupboard in question. 
SCOTTY It's...it's something cylindrical? I think it's a pencil? 
BILL DJANGO Okay. Larry? Larry rolls his eyes up in his head, speaks in a high wavering voice with a bad cockney accent. 
LARRY HOOPER This is Larry's Spirit Guide, Maud. I'm looking into the cupboard now and I'm seeing...I'm seeing...a tin mug? 
BILL DJANGO Lyn? Lyn stares at his hands, focused. He looks up suddenly, puzzled. 
LYN CASSADY It's a man on a chair. Bill unlocks the little cupboard and takes a photograph of the Lincoln Memorial. There are murmurs of admiration from the watching Jedis. 
(CONTINUED) 
82   CONTINUED:                                                82 
LARRY HOOPER 
(BLUSTERING) Oh, no, wait. See, I thought you said K, not A! Bill ignores him, smiles at Lyn. 
BILL DJANGO Bravo Zulu, Lyn. Outstanding. Larry looks daggers at Lyn. 
83   EXT. FIELD - DAY - THE PAST                               83 
Lyn is walking calmly over the HOT COALS as the other Jedis watch, impressed. 
84   INT. GYM - DAY - THE PAST                                 84 
Bill is leading the Jedis in AIKIDO. 
BILL DJANGO Aikido is a vehicle for harmonizing ourselves with the Universe and the Way. Look upon these sessions as an opportunity to discover yourself and your training partner in a loving environment. 
LATER Larry flails violently at Lyn. Lyn FLIPS him with ease. Larry gets up and CHARGES bellowing at Lyn who FLIPS him out of the frame. Bill joins Lyn. 
BILL DJANGO (CONT'D) (addressing the watching Jedi's) Notice how Lyn's circular motions turned Larry's aggression back upon him. Good work Lyn. A CHAIR flies through the frame, just missing Lyn's head. 
BILL DJANGO (CONT'D) (without looking at 
HIM) Larry, go outside, calm down. 
85   INT. REMOTE VIEWING ROOM - DAY - THE PAST                 85 
Lyn lies on a couch drinking a beer, staring at a large BROWN ENVELOPE. Bill sits beside him with pad and paper. 
(CONTINUED) 
85   CONTINUED:                                             85 Lyn opens the envelope and stares at the PHOTOGRAPH of the NATO GENERAL inside. 
BOB (V.O.) After a year's training, Lyn was given his first tasking. A senior Nato General had been kidnapped by Red Brigade members in Italy. Bill was unofficially asked if his unit would be able to help find him before it was too late. 
LYN CASSADY 
(CONCENTRATING) We're north of Verona. It's a little town. There's a lake nearby. I can see a Cinema. Across from the Cinema is a shop or, or...it's a cafe. He's in the apartment above. The town is called...it's something sweet. (Beat) Dolce. It's called Dolce. Bill looks proudly over to where an important looking OFFICIAL watches from the next room. The Official looks impressed. 
BOB (V.O.) It's true that the unit never found out whether any of their remote viewings were accurate or not. Nevertheless from that moment on Lyn's reputation soared. 
86   INT. EX-MESS HALL - DAY                                   86 
Lyn stands in front of the other Jedis. 
BILL DJANGO Rank, medals...these things mean little to the Jedi. But growth in spirit, in wisdom, in psychic power, these things earn our respect. He presents Lyn with an EAGLE FEATHER. 
BILL DJANGO (CONT'D) Native Americans believed that when one received an Eagle feather, it was the mark of love, of gratitude and ultimate respect. Only true Human Beings may carry the Eagle feather. He gives the feather to a deeply moved Lyn, as the other Jedis applaud. Larry watches Lyn with HATE. 
87   INT. REMOTE VIEWING ROOM - DAY - THE PAST                 87 
Lyn lies on the couch, drinking another beer, the Eagle Feather on a chain around his neck. A period song is playing in the room. 
BOB (V.O.) The word soon got out in the intelligence community that there was a sergeant at Fort Bragg who could find whatever you needed found. It was as if Lyn could fly anywhere in the world without leaving his room. We TRACK INTO LYN'S EYE - UNTIL WE ARE INSIDE HIS MIND. LYN'S MIND P.O.V - We move towards the wall. 
BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) As Bill Django said - the Force truly was strong with this one. As the song breaks into the chorus we burst through the wall, into freedom... 
91   EXT. ARMY BASE - DAY - THE PAST                          91 
OVER-HEAD SHOT - Ben lies on the ground staring up at us. We hear the sound of an approaching engine. 
BOB (V.O.) Another demonstration involved letting a recruit drive a jeep over him. This, in the end, was to be his undoing. Next second a JEEP roars straight over Ben, going at sixty miles an hour. We FREEZE FRAME on the JEEP. 
BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) Before his untimely death Ben caused quite a stir by advocating his controversial "shock and awe" knife attack method. 
92   INT. DOJO - DAY                                          92 
Ben leaps spastically in the air, spinning and shrieking, a knife held in one hand. 
BOB (V.O.) The approach was hailed by some knife aficionados as revolutionary but criticized by others who believed that the leaping and spinning might lead you to accidentally stab yourself. TRACKING ALONG BEN'S TRAINEE JEDIS - as they watch his display. 
BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) Lyn Cassady, however, became a firm convert to the style. We reach LYN who TURNS TO CAMERA. 
LYN CASSADY Ben, you're not forgotten. The knife you gave me lies next to my beret. God bless Ben Echmeyer. 
93   EXT. DESERT - EARLY MORNING                               93 
We UN-FREEZE ON LYN - as he whirls and shrieks towards the Insurgent. Bob watches amazed from where he lies on the sand. 
BOB (V.O.) Of course, Lyn didn't actually have a knife with him at this particular time...so I still think what he did was kinda...reckless. The Insurgent, understandably startled, flinches backwards, trips over the water bottle and falls on his ass. Lyn scoops up the gallon bottle of water and begins to POUND the fallen man with it. The Young Iraqi moves to intervene but Lyn smacks him in the face with the bottle. The BLINDFOLDED IRAQI IN THE TRUCK manages to open the door and stumbles out, claws his blindfold off and races away over the sand. The second Insurgent is distracted for a moment by his victim's flight. When he turns back Lyn has scooped up the Insurgent's GUN and is aiming it at him. Beat. Nobody moves. 
94   EXT. ROAD - MOMENTS LATER                                 94 
The sun is rising as the PICK-UP TRUCK roars over the sand and swerves onto the road. 
INSIDE THE TRUCK Lyn drives. Bob is leaning out of the window, staring at the road behind them. 
BOB (pulling his head back in) They're not coming! We're okay! Oh God, we're gonna be okay! The Truck crests a hill and we see the IRAQI MAN running desperately down the road ahead of us, his hands tied. 
LYN CASSADY There he is. He puts his foot down and the truck roars after the running man. 
(CONTINUED) 
94   CONTINUED:                                                94 
TRACKING SHOT - pulling the IRAQI MAN, running for all he's worth. Lyn leans out of the truck window as he drives up behind him. 
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D) (yelling over the 
ENGINE) Sir? You're okay! We're Americans. We're here to help you! Terrified the Man sprints faster. Lyn tries to pass him, but the Man veers at the same time and the truck CLIPS him, sending him flying. 
IN THE TRUCK 
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D) Oh crap! 
BOB What happened? 
LYN CASSADY 
(BRAKING) I think I just ran him over. 
95   EXT. ROAD                                                 95 
Lyn runs over to where the MAN lies moaning on the road, his head bleeding. 
LYN CASSADY Sir? Are you okay? (Beat) Bob, give me a hand here will you? Bob gets out and the two lift the Iraqi Man and begin to carry him back towards the truck. They stop listening to an approaching rumble. 
BOB Oh shit! Oh shit, they're coming! They scuttle faster back towards the truck, the Iraqi Man dangling between them. Next second, two GLEAMING WHITE SUVs crest the hill and roar towards them. Seeing the road blocked by the truck, the SUVs screech to a halt and several MEN IN FLAK JACKETS AND SUNGLASSES tumble out in formation, aiming their M-16's at Lyn and Bob. ARMED MEN'S P.O.V - Lyn and Bob stare at them before dropping the bound Iraqi on the ground. Bob waves nervously. 
(CONTINUED) 
95   CONTINUED:                                                 95

96   INT. S.U.V - DAY                                           96 
LAPTOP SCREEN We're rushing over a CGI DESERT, between the CGI rivers Tigress and Euphrates towards a GLEAMING CITY rising from the sand. 
NIXON (O.S.) Then I say "There it is. The Future!" Bob and the Iraqi Man sit beside TODD NIXON - a suit. Lyn sits behind in between two of the PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS, who are nodding along to the music playing in the car. Nixon, holding the LAPTOP for Bob to see, watches the screen, moved. 
NIXON (CONT'D) We play this on these big screens at the conferences, you know? This trumpet music blasting out. Every time I see it, it gets me. He glances over at the Iraqi Man who is holding a dressing to the cut on his forehead, pale and shaken. 
TEXAN SECURITY MAN Bullshit. 
NIXON (cheerfully, out of the window) He did fill her up last time Gary. 
(CONTINUED) 
99    CONTINUED:                                                99 
TEXAN SECURITY MAN With respect sir, bull-fucking- shit. I tanked her last time. 
THIRD SECURITY MAN Every time! Can we get some sort of fucking system so we don't... We hear a sudden, sharp POPPING sound. Immediately the Men drop into CROUCHES, scanning the area. 
TEXAN SECURITY MAN 
(YELLING) Contact! We've got contact! He opens FIRE - IMMEDIATE CHAOS: people scream, duck down, some cars reverse desperately and collide with the cars behind. The other Security Men join in the shooting. 
THIRD SECURITY MAN 
(SHOOTING) Where? Where's the shooter? 
100   ACROSS THE STREET                                        100 Another SUV - identical, but black, is passing, hemmed in by traffic. A stray BULLET from the gas-station pings off it's armor plating. Immediately it screeches to a halt and a NEW DETACHMENT OF SECURITY MEN roll from the car - same flak-jackets and Oakley sunglasses but different color uniforms. 
NEW SECURITY MAN (into radio) Contact! We're under fire! The New Detachment open FIRE blindly in the general direction of the Station. 
101   GAS STATION                                              101 ...as bullets smack off the parked SUV. 
THIRD SECURITY MAN Two o'clock! Two o'clock! All the Security Men turns and begin spraying bullets across the road. Car windshields and windows explode. 
INSIDE THE SUV A scowling Nixon has slid low in his seat. 
NIXON (muttering to 
HIMSELF)

101   CONTINUED:                                                101 
NIXON (CONT'D) Trying to help you fucking savages. Mahmud, Bob and Lyn are lying flat on the seats. 
MAHMUD DAASH My house is not far. We could walk from here. Bob flinches as another bullet ricochets off the SUV. 
BOB Sounds good Muhammad. 
MAHMUD DAASH Mahmud. 
102   GAS STATION                                               102 As machine-gun fire from across the street strafes the station and Nixon's Security men return fire blindly. 
FIRST SECURITY MAN (yelling into Radio) Krom One this is Freedom Frontier. We are under attack. This is a FUBAR situation. Requesting Kiowa! Behind him Lyn, Bob and Mahmud crawl across the station on their hands and knees, bullets zipping past them. 
103   EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER                               103 
Mahmud leads Bob and Lyn at a crouching run down the street, amongst the crowd of Iraqis fleeing the gunfire behind them. We hear the whup-whup of a helicopter as a Kiowa Warrior passes over head. Moments later we hear an EXPLOSION as the helicopter opens fire with a MISSILE... 
104   INT. MAHMUD'S HOUSE - EVENING                             104 
TRACKING along a wall, past a crooked WEDDING PORTRAIT - a smiling Mahmud and WIFE, the glass broken... 
BOB (V.O.) Muhammad led us to his home which it turned out had been robbed in his absence. We TRACK past a row of BULLET HOLES in the wall, a section of smoke damaged wall paper. 
(CONTINUED) 
104   CONTINUED:                                                  104 
BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) And also accidentally set on fire by a US tank. Neighbors told him his wife had left, they weren't sure where she had gone. We reach Bob, Lyn and Mahmud eating at a low table. The windows behind them have been partially boarded up. Mahmud is sunk into a profound depression. Lyn looks tired, pale. They eat in awkward silence. 
LYN CASSADY What is this? 
MAHMUD DAASH Taameeyah. 
LYN CASSADY They're really good. Bob nods politely. Mahmud nods, sighs. 
BOB (V.O.) I understood he was going     through a lot, but considering we     had saved him from kidnappers     I still thought his welcome could     have been a little warmer. Lyn clears his throat. 
LYN CASSADY I'm very sorry for running you over, sir. Mahmud shrugs. 
LYN CASSADY Level Two. Intuition. We were trained to make correct decisions. Somebody runs up to you and says "There's a fork in the road. Do we turn left or do we turn right? And you go...(snapping his fingers) "We go right!" Bob stares at him. 
BOB Just...instant? 
LYN CASSADY Instant. (Snapping his fingers) Just like that. 
BOB 
WE'VE BEEN SITTING HERE FOR HALF 
AN HOUR! HOW'S THAT "INSTANT?" Lyn abruptly starts the engine and takes the right turn. 
BOB (CONT'D) Oh, it's that way? 
LYN CASSADY 
(GRIMLY) Yes. It's this way. 
BOB Right. Now you know.

Below us the car drives off into the empty landscape, getting smaller and smaller. Then... BOOM. We see the flash of the explosion and the Renault is flipped like a toy car. A ribbon of black smoke rises into the blue sky. Silence. 
128   EXT. DESERT - LATER                                      128 
BOB's P.O.V - We are stumbling forward towards a sand berm. We hear the sound of heavy breathing. 
BOB (O.S.) 
(CROAKING) What...what happened? Lyn is staggering over the sand with Bob on his back. He is holding his backpack. Bob has a gash on his forehead which is bleeding. Under the blood his face is white. In the distance, behind them, we can see the column of black smoke rising. 
LYN CASSADY 
IED. 
BOB 
(BEAT) What? 
LYN CASSADY Improvised Explosive Device. 
BOB Oh Jesus. 
LYN CASSADY You're okay Bob. It's gonna be okay. 
BOB I can't believe this. Great fucking intuition Lyn. I can't...put me down. I can walk. Put me down. Lyn puts Bob down. Bob keels sideways onto the sand and lies there, wheezing. 
BOB (CONT'D) Oh, Jeez. Oh, Jeez. 
LYN CASSADY Alright, c'mon... He hauls Bob to his feet, puts his baseball cap on him and pulls him onto his back. Bob hangs there limply as Lyn sets off again. 
(CONTINUED) 
128   CONTINUED:                                               128 
Lyn reaches up and gropes at Bob's face, removing his spectacles. Bob doesn't notice. 
BOB Where are we going? We should stay with the car so the army can find us. 
LYN CASSADY Fedayeen will find us first. 
BOB Well, I disagree. I totally disagree.(Beat) The Federal what? 
LYN CASSADY Fedayeen Saddam. Paramilitary. Fellas who probably laid the IED. They could be on their way now. Hold this Bob. He passes Bob his backpack. They stagger on in silence for a moment, Bob jogging up and down on Lyn's back. Lyn snaps the legs off Bob's glasses, uses them as improvised divining rods to scan the sand ahead. 
BOB What are you doing? 
LYN CASSADY Could be IED's or mines around here. I'm checking for disturbances in the telluric current. 
LYN CASSADY I don't have Crohns. 
BOB What's the matter with you? 
LYN CASSADY I'm dying. Bob stares at him, stunned. 
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D) I've been murdered. 
130   EXT. DESERT - NIGHT                                      130 
Lyn sits staring up at the immense MOON above them. Bob sits watching, huddled against the cold, in the shelter of some rocks. Lyn gets up, stumbles back over to him and lies down, struggling for breath, white with pain. 
LYN CASSADY It's gone Bob. I can't find him. I've lost my power. It's the curse. 
BOB What curse? 
LYN CASSADY (With profound 
SADNESS) They took this... beautiful thing we'd been building and they corrupted it. They destroyed the New Earth Army. 
(CONTINUED)

LYN CASSADY I did. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
131   INT. EX-MESS HALL - FORT BRAGG - DAY - THE PAST           131 
The Jedis, now indistinguishable from other soldiers, stand white-washing over the COSMIC MURALS. Major Holtz stands watching. 
MAJOR HOLTZ Yoga is not the business of the US Army, ladies. Drumming circles are not the business of the Army. And love and peace is most certainly not the business of the Army. So you girls better start thinking about how you CAN engage in the business of the United States Army, which, in case you have forgotten, involves winning fucking wars! 
BOB (V.O.) When the dust of the Pendleton Affair had settled it revealed a surprising victor. 
132   INT. MAJOR HOLTZ'S OFFICE - DAY - THE PAST                132 
Larry stands to attention in front of Holtz, a REPORT held under one arm. 
BOB (V.O.) Major Holtz regarded Larry Hooper as a patriotic whistle-blower and the one sound fruit in an otherwise dubious barrel of apples. 
LARRY HOOPER It's some scientific research I've done for possible offensive psi applications sir. (Beat) I did show the report to Lieutenant Colonel Django, but he didn't seem interested. Holtz snorts angrily. 
(CONTINUED) 
132   CONTINUED:                                                 132 
MAJOR HOLTZ 
(MUTTERING) I bet he wasn't. He takes the report and begins to look through it. Pause. He looks up slowly at Larry. 
MAJOR HOLTZ (CONT'D) We have men who can do this? 
LARRY HOOPER (a sly smile) I think I know one sir. Holtz ponders the report, tempted. 
MAJOR HOLTZ But we don't have the resources. 
LARRY HOOPER Well sir...there is goat lab? 
133   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - DAY - THE PAST                   133 
The building we saw at the top of the film. A hundred GOATS stare silently at us. 
BOB (V.O.) Goat Lab was originally created as a clandestine laboratory to provide in-the-field surgical training for Special Forces soldiers. We BOOM down to reveal that many of the goats have their legs in PLASTER. 
BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) The goats would get shot in the leg with a bolt gun and then a trainee would have to dress the wound successfully. Goat lab actually used to be called Dog Lab... 
134   SMALL DOG STARING AT US                                    134 ...with big, brown eyes. 
BOB (V.O.) But it turned out most soldiers didn't feel good shooting dogs in the leg... A SOLDIER stares doubtfully down at the dog, bolt-gun in hand. 
135   EXT. NEVADA TEST SITE - DAY - THE PAST                 135 
(SOLEMNLY) The goat is dead. The three men stare at him. 
MAJOR HOLTZ 
(HOARSELY) Goat number four? 
SOLDIER 
(SURPRISED) No. Number five. 
144   EXT. DESERT - NIGHT - THE PRESENT                        144 
Bob stares at Lyn aghast. 
BOB Collateral damage? 
LYN CASSADY (eyes glistening) Collateral damage. (Beat) That was it. I'd used my powers for evil and it was like I brought a curse upon us all. Like that poem where the guy kills the seagull and they make him wear it round his neck. Every night I'd dream of that goat in its little bib, it's mouth opening and closing but nothing coming out... Bob shakes his head, stares out into the darkness. 
(CONTINUED) 
144   CONTINUED:                                                  144 
BOB The silence of the goats. Lyn flicks a suspicious glance at Bob, but is reassured by his solemn expression. 
LYN CASSADY I finished my tour and I quit. I walked out of the unit and I never went back. 
145   EXT. FORT BRAGG - DAY                                       145 
Lyn, wearing civilian clothes and holding a suitcase, is walking off the base. He reaches the gates and turns for one last look at the place that has been his home. 
BOB (V.O.) But before he could leave Larry arranged one last parting gift. Lyn tuns back to the gates and finds Larry Hooper standing in front of him, looking WIRED. 
LYN CASSADY What do you wan...? Before he can finish Larry CHOPS his hand down in an odd blow onto Lyn's forehead. Lyn staggers back a little, holding his head. 
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D) What the hell? Larry has already darted around him with a crazy laugh and is running madly back into the base. Lyn stares after him, stunned. 
LYN CASSADY (V.O.) (CONT'D) It was the Dim Mak. 
146   EXT. DESERT - NIGHT - THE PRESENT                           146 
Bob looks at Lyn, puzzled. 
BOB The Dim Mak? 
LYN CASSADY The Dim Mak. The Quivering Palm. The Death Touch. It's like this legendary, martial arts move. It was forbidden in the New Earth Army. Larry had got it from a mail- order book. 
(CONTINUED)

LYN CASSADY (Beat, patiently) It kills you Bob. With one touch. 
BOB Jesus. 
LYN CASSADY There's a story that Wong Wifu, great Chinese martial artist, had a fight with some guy and had him beat when the guy gave him this light tap, and Wong looked at him and the guy just nodded. That was it. He'd given him the death touch and Wong died. 
BOB Then and there? 
LYN CASSADY No. Eighteen years later. That's the weird thing with Dim Mak - you never know when it's going to take effect. He flops back, too tired to talk anymore. Bob watches him as he falls asleep. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
147   EXT. DESERT - MORNING                                      147 
The same horizon, the dunes now burning under the sun. We TRACK back and find Bob and Lyn lying asleep, lips cracked, dehydrated, exhausted. Faintly we hear a sound - a tinny BELL. It gets closer. Groggily Bob opens his eyes just as a GOAT walks into the frame and walks past him, the bell tied around its neck. Bob lies, watching it pass, trying to work out if it's a hallucination. He struggles to his feet and sets off up the berm he's been lying at the foot of. The goat walks on ahead of Bob, crests the top of the berm and disappears from sight. Bob reaches the top of the berm and stands, swaying, staring down at something. CLOSE ON BOB'S FACE - stunned. 
148   EXT. BERM - DAY                                          148 
Bob is dragging a barely conscious Lyn up the berm, following the goat. He staggers, barely able to put one foot in front of the other. At last we crest the top of the berm and find ourselves looking down on a WATER-HOLE, fringed with palms. The goat stands drinking. It stops to look up at us. 
149   EXT. WATER-HOLE - DAY                                    149 
Bob and Lyn collapse into the wet mud of the hole. Bob manages to cup some water into Lyn's mouth and then his own. He rolls onto his back, stares up at the burning sky. We hear a dull roaring, muffled, growing in volume. A HELICOPTER is approaching... 
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) Oh, that's an Iraqi Psyops leaflet they dropped on us. 
BOB 
(READING) "American Soldier - your wives are back home having sex with Bart Simpson and Bert Reynolds." 
LARRY HOOPER Yeah, hadn't exactly done their homework there. Lyn is staring at Bill who is looking a little vacantly at the racks of CD's. Larry notices. 
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) How'd you find us, Lyn? 
LYN CASSADY I remote viewed you. Larry smiles a little mockingly. 
BOB If this is Psyops what are you doing here? 
LARRY HOOPER I said primarily Psyops. This is a restricted area, you understand? Everything you hear and see stays secret or you go to prison. Bob nods a little nervously. 
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) There are individuals in the current administration who are looking for...creative solutions for the War on Terror.

154   CONTINUED: (2)                                          154 
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) They're far more open minded then their predecessors, and they've out-sourced experimental research to my company. He indicates the PSIC name badge he's wearing. 
BOB "Sick?" 
LARRY HOOPER It's pronounced psi-ike. Psychic Systems International Corp. Turns out certain people had heard about the New Earth Army and were interested in some of the work we were doing back then. They got in touch with me, I got in touch with Bill. 
LYN CASSADY (To Bill) You're working for him? Bill frowns at the CDs, not seeming to hear. 
LARRY HOOPER Bill's been looking into subliminal messaging. (Selecting a disc) This is one we've designed to play to our own troops before combat. He puts the disc in a player and presses play. We hear a burst of a period song. 
BOB There's a subliminal message in this? 
LARRY HOOPER (reading the CD) This is..."Don't get drunk before firing heavy machine guns." We've got all sort of products in development.(To Worker) Tell them one of our new ideas. 
PSIC WORKER Air bag mine? 
LARRY HOOPER Air bag mine. Non-lethal mine, catapults the fucker up into air. (To another) Gimme another one. 
2ND PSIC WORKER Blast target with pheromones and then release Attack Bees. 
(CONTINUED) 
154   CONTINUED: (3)                                           154 
LARRY HOOPER Excellent. Attack Bees. The Forces of Nature! Another. 
1ST PSIC WORKER Project Achilles. We mutilate enemy corpses and... 
LARRY HOOPER We're not doing that anymore! (Throwing an eraser at the worker) Idiot! He turns back to Lyn. 
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) The point is we've got a budget, we've got supporters. I'm rebuilding the New Earth Army. Only this time without the hippy crap. Bill stands up and starts walking a little unsteadily towards the door. 
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) You okay Bill? 
BILL DJANGO (Without turning) Gonna get some ice-cream. Larry waits until Bill has left before turning back to Lyn. 
LARRY HOOPER You get the odd flash of what he used to be but... he's pretty burnt out with the booze. Larry shakes his head in apparent sorrow. Then he notices some candy on a desk. 
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) Ooo, Twizzlers. He picks it up and starts to eat it. 
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) (To Lyn) You want one? Lyn shakes his head, trying not to show the emotions he is feeling. 
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) (Watching him) God, I love these things... 
155   INT. BASE - CORRIDOR - DAY                               155 
Bob helps Lyn down the corridor. Lyn suddenly stops, listening. There is a faint sound of MUSIC coming from somewhere nearby. 
156   INT. BASE - CELL CORRIDOR - DAY                          156 
Lyn walks down the corridor, Bob following. At the end of the corridor is a single door with a SPY-HOLE. The loud music is coming from there. We can hear now that it is an annoying children's show song or heavy metal. We TRACK towards the door... Lyn hesitates then slides back the SPY-HOLE cover and peers in. 
159   INT. ARMY BASE - TENT - NIGHT                         159 
Lyn lies sleeping. Larry sits at the foot of his bed, smoking a cigar. He watches Lyn for a moment, then COUGHS deliberately. Nothing. He repeats the cough - louder. Lyn wakes. 
LARRY HOOPER Oh. Didn't mean to wake you. The two men stare at each other. 
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) Heard you weren't feeling well? 
LYN CASSADY 
(BEAT) Just tired. 
LARRY HOOPER How'd you find us? 
LYN CASSADY I told you. I remote viewed you. 
LARRY HOOPER 
(SMILING) Scotty Mercer told you, didn't he? 
LYN CASSADY No. 
LARRY HOOPER Yeah, he did. We told Scotty we were coming over here, asked him if he wanted some work. 
LYN CASSADY I haven't seen Scotty. 
LARRY HOOPER That's funny, because he told me he'd run into you and mentioned that there might be some jobs going with us over here. (Beat) Isn't that why you came, really, Lyn? You want back in, don't you? Lyn stares at him, disturbed, afraid this might be true. 
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) It can happen. You've only got to say the word. Could be the new Golden Age for Psi research. 
(MORE)                (CONTINUED) 
159   CONTINUED:                                                 159 
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) You, me and Bill, back together again. Just like the old days. Larry closes his eyes, trying to remember something. 
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) Mother Earth, my life support system. As a soldier I must drink your blue water, live inside your red clay and eat your green skin. Lyn listens, moved despite himself. 
160   EXT. BASE - NIGHT                                          160 
Bill and Bob stand on a picnic table, under the full moon. Bill is leading Bob through some YOGA POSITIONS. Both are drunk. 
LARRY HOOPER (V.O.) I pray my boots will always kiss your face and my footsteps match your heartbeat. 
161   INT. ARMY BASE - TENT - NIGHT                              161 
Lyn can't help but join in the prayer. 
LARRY AND LYN Carry my body through space and time. You are my connection to the Universe... 
162   EXT. BASE - NIGHT                                          162 
Bill and Bob both stand in a difficult position - balanced on one leg. 
LARRY AND LYN (V.O.) ...and all that comes after. I am yours and you are mine. As we watch Bill slowly topples forward off the table and crashes out of sight below. 
163   INT. ARMY BASE - ROOM - NIGHT                              163 
The two men finish the prayer. 
LARRY AND LYN I salute you. 
(CONTINUED) 
163   CONTINUED:                                                 163 
LARRY HOOPER 
(BEAT) Don't make a decision now. Tell me in the morning. He pats Lyn's leg, walks out. 
164   EXT. BASE - NIGHT                                          164 
Bob is holding a concussed Bill who has a cut on his head. 
BOB Bill? Bill are you okay? Bill opens his eyes suddenly. 
ARMY BROADCASTER (CONT'D) That hurt Greg, you fucking dip- shit. (Laughing too)You fuckity fuck dip-shit fuck-hole. (Remembering something) Hey! Music! He hits a button. 
168   EXT. BASE - MORNING                                        168 
CLOSE on a LOUDSPEAKER - blasting a period song out over the base. We BOOM down to where two SOLDIERS are dancing, tripping. 
ALL OVER THE BASE Soldiers are wandering around, talking, some falling to their knees, weak with laughter. Some stand alone, staring with a beatific smile at the sky. 
(CONTINUED) 
168   CONTINUED:                                               168 
As the music plays on a STRYKER ARMORED VEHICLE drives around the corner of a building, a SOLDIER standing up, arms raised, in the gun turret. The Stryker screeches into a clumsy skid, the Soldier having to hang on. The Stryker roars off again, heading straight for the GATES of the base. 
SOLDIER (calling down into the vehicle) You're going to hit the gates. You're going to hit the gates. The Stryker veers left and smashes through the perimeter fence and out into the desert. 
SOLDIER (CONT'D) 
(CALMLY) It's okay. You missed them. 
169   INT. RADIO STATION - MORNING                             169 
The DJ and the Producer are wrestling over the sound desk, laughing. 
170   INT. BASE - CORRIDOR                                     170 
Bob and Bill walk towards the cell block. 
BOB 
(ANGRY) Don't you think it might have been more sensible if we hadn't drunk the fucking water? 
BILL DJANGO That might have aroused suspicion. But don't worry. Over the years I have built up a massive tolerance to all narcotics. 
171   INT. CELL - MORNING                                      171 
An IRAQI PRISONER looks up startled as the door to the cell is flung open and Bill stands, filling the doorway, bare-chested, wild-eyed and wild-haired. 
BILL DJANGO In the name of the New Earth Army and loving people everywhere I'm liberating this base! 
172   INT. GOAT SHED - MORNING                                 172 
Lyn slides open the door to the shed and begins to shoo the goats out into the light. 
173   EXT. BASE - LATER                                        173 
As the music continues Bob, Lyn and Bill appear leading a column of nervous IRAQI PRISONERS out of the building, towards the gates. Lyn and Bill are holding BABY GOATS in their ARMS. A tripping Bob is holding bunches of flowers - it's as close as they can get to the illustration from the New Earth Army Manual. Lyn holds up a hand to stop the procession. Larry stands in front of them, a GUN in his hand, his face blank. Lyn and Larry stare at each other. Then, unexpectedly, Larry starts to cry. 
LYN CASSADY 
(SOFTLY) Give me the gun Larry. Larry starts to raise the gun to his mouth. Pauses. Scratches his head. 
LARRY HOOPER Wow. I'm hungry. He wanders off. 
ARMY DJ (O.S.) (Over loudspeaker, 
LAUGHING) Hey! More music! (muffled) Get off, will ya? Over the loud-speakers we hear the opening of a period song. 
LYN CASSADY (Beat, relieved) Okay, let's go. 
174   FLATTENED SECTION OF FENCE                               174 Bob and Lyn stand at one side, Bill at the other, beckoning the prisoners through, hugging the prisoners as they pass through. 
LYN CASSADY We're very sorry. Ma'assalama. 
(CONTINUED) 
174   CONTINUED:                                              174 
One by one the Iraqis walk out through the broken fence, staring around them suspiciously, expecting a trap. Nothing happens, no one shoots them. 
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D) 
(WAVING) That's it. Keep going. Ma'assalama. The Iraqis start to hurry away over the sand. Beyond them we can the Stryker, driving in circles in the desert, a NAKED SOLDIER stands whooping on top. 
175   EXT. BASE - LATER                                        175

SUSAN Yes... 
EDMUND Is it Latin for worst game ever invented? 
LUCY We could play hide-and-seek 
PETER but we're already having so much fun! 
TUMNUS Spare Oom, is that in Narnia? 
LUCY Narnia? What's that? 
TUMNUS My dear girl, you're in it!  Everything from the lamp post, all the way to castle Cair Paravel on the Eastern Sea, every stick and stone, every icicle, is Narnia, 
LUCY This is an awfully big wardrobe 
TUMNUS I'm sorry, please allow me to introduce myself, my name is Tumnus 
LUCY Glad to meet you, Mr. Tumnus! *extends hand* I'm Lucy Pevensie. Oh, you shake it! 
TUMNUS Why? 
LUCY I-I don't know! People do it when they meet each other. 
TUMNUS Lucy Pevensie, from the shining city of War Drobe in the far land of Spare Oom, how would it be if you came and had tea with me? 
LUCY Oh! Well, thank you very much! But I probably should be getting back... 
TUMNUS Oh, come on! It's not every day I get to make a new friend! And there's a... roaring fire! And toast and cakes! And maybe... we'll even break into the sardines. 
LUCY Well, maybe for just a little while... if you have... sardines. 
TUMNUS By the bucket load, 
TUMNUS Come Along. 
IN TUMNUS' HOUSE 
LUCY Can I help you with that? 
TUMNUS Why thank you! 
Lucy looks at the picture. 
TUMNUS Oh... That is my father. 
LUCY He had a nice face. You look just like him. 
TUMNUS We must move quietly the woods are full of her spies, even some of the trees are on her side 
LUCY I think so. (Tumnus starts to return her handkerchief, but she gives it back) Keep it, you need it more than I do. 
Tumnus laughs, and touches Lucy's nose... 
MR. TUMNUS Go...   Come on, go! 
Lucy runs off, and Mr. Tumnus returns to his home 
Lucy heads for the wardrobe

PETER 98, 99, 100... Ready or not here I come. 
LUCY I'm back, I'm back, it's alright, 
EDMUND Shhh, he's coming. 
PETER You know, I'm not sure if you two have quite gotten the idea of this game! 
LUCY but weren't you wondering where I was? 
EDMUND That's the point! That's why he was seeking you! 
SUSAN Does this mean I win? 
PETER I don't think Lucy wants to play anymore. 
Susan looks in the wardrobe.. 
SUSAN The only wood in here is the back of the wardrobe. 
PETER One game at a time Lu, we don't all have your imagination. 
LUCY But I wasn't imagining! 
SUSAN that's enough 
Dwarf puts knife to Edmund's throat 
WHITE WITCH What is it Ginarrbrik? 
EDMUND He won't let go! 
DWARF Is that how you address the Queen of Narnia? 
EDMUND I didn't know? 
DWARF Well, you shall know her better afterwards. 
WHITE WITCH Wait! What is your name Son-of-Adam? 
EDMUND Edmund, your majesty. 
WHITE WITCH And how was it, Edmund, that you came to enter my dominion? 
EDMUND I walked through a wardrobe following my sister. 
WHITE WITCH Your sister? How many are you? 
EDMUND four 
WHITE WITCH Edmund you look so cold! Come and sit with me here on my sledge. (Edmund joins her) Now, would like something warm to drink. 
EDMUND Yes...your majesty.(Take vial and drops a green drop on snow that become a hot drink that the dwarf gives Edmund) How did you do that? 
WHITE WITCH I can make anything you like. 
EDMUND Could you make me taller? 
WHITE WITCH I can make anything you like to eat 
EDMUND Turkish Delight

WHITE WITCH I'd love to see your family 
PETER (rolls over still half asleep) Lucy, what are talking about? 
LUCY Narnia! It's all in the wardrobe, like I told you! 
Susan comes in. 
SUSAN Oh Lucy, you've been dreaming. 
LUCY No I wasn't, I saw Mr. Tumnus again! Oh, and this time - Edmund went too. 
PETER You saw the faun? 
LUCY Well, he didn't actually go there with me. What were you doing Edmund? 
EDMUND I-I was just playing along. You know what little children are like these days, they just don't know when to stop pretending (sits on his bed looking smugly at Lucy) 
Lucy starts to cry and runs out of the room. Susan runs after her and so does Peter - who shoves Edmund over 
EDMUND Ow! 
Lucy runs down the hall and smack into the Professor, she looks up a little frightened and then starts her crying all over again, hugging him 
MRS. MACREADY You children are one shenanigan shy of sleeping' in the stable- oh, Professor! I told them you were not to be disturbed. 
PROFESSOR Oh, it's alright Mrs. Macready - I'm sure there's a logical explanation. But I think this one needs some hot chocolate. 
MRS. MACREADY Yes Professor. Come on, dear. 
Mrs. Macready takes Lucy down the hall. Peter and Susan turn to go 
PROFESSOR *Ahem* (the two turn and follow him into his office and the Professor sits at his desk and takes some tobacco out of it's silver apple case and puts it in his pipe) 
PROFESSOR You seem to have upset the internal balance of my housekeeper. 
PETER We are very sorry sir, it won't happen again. 
SUSAN It's our sister sir, Lucy. 
PROF The weeping girl? 
CRICKET 
PETER Peter winds up, goes for the bowl! 
Ball hits Edmund in the leg 
EDMUND Ow! 
PETER Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream! 
EDMUND Can't we play hide and go seek again? 
PETER I thought you said that it was a kid's game. 
SUSAN Besides, we can all use the fresh air. 
EDMUND Not like there's air inside 
PETER Are you ready then? 
EDMUND Are you? (smacks his bat on the ground and gets ready to hit the ball) 
Peter pitches the ball, hard, and Edmund whacks it good and it smashes through an upstairs window and crashes into a suit of armor. 
UPSTAIRS 
The children are looking at the broken window and the suit of armor on the floor 
PETER Well done, Ed! 
EDMUND You bowled it! 
SUSAN Listen, Mrs. Macready is coming 
PETER Run! 
EDMUND (runs to the wardrobe and opens the door) Come on! 
SUSAN You have got to be joking. 
LUCY Is he alright? 
MR. BEAVER Further in.(Mr. Beaver scurries off, Susan grabs Peter by the arm) 
SUSAN Peter, we don't know what you are doing. 
EDMUND She's right. How do we know we can trust this beaver? 
PETER He say's he knows the faun. 
SUSAN He's a beaver...he shouldn't be saying anything! 
MR. BEAVER Is everything alright? 
PETER Yes. We were just talking 
MR. BEAVER That's better left for safer corners. 
LUCY He means the trees. 
Walk to Beaver's dam through the cliffs under a bridge and then they see the Dam 
MR. BEAVER There is home sweet home. 
LUCY Oh, what a beautiful dam Mr. Beaver. 
MR. BEAVER Merely a trifle. 
MRS. BEAVER Is that you Beaver? I find out you've been out with Badger again I'll...Oh, they're not Badgers. I never thought I would see this day 
to Mr. Beaver You couldn't give me ten minutes warning...look at this fur. 
MR. BEAVER I would have given you a week if I thought it would help (hee hee) 
MRS. BEAVER Well you must be cold and hungry. Let's get you inside for some food and civilized conversation. 
Lucy, Susan & Peter follow Mrs. Beaver inside, Edmund see's Jadis's castle...right where it's suppose to be 
MR. BEAVER Enjoying the scenery, are we? 
PETER I think you've made a mistake; we're not heroes! 
SUSAN We're from Finchley! 
PETER I think it's time we were going. 
LUCY But what about Mr. Tumnus? 
PETER Sorry Lucy. It's out of our hands. 
SUSAN Thank you for your hospitality. 
PETER Ed, time to go- Ed? (looks around the room) I'm going to kill him. 
MR. BEAVER You may not have to...Has Edmund been to Narnia before? 
Shot of Ed walking to the Witch's castle without his coat - shot of the others trying to catch up to him 
PETER Hurry up! 
They reach the top of the hill and see Ed going through the Witch's castle gates 
LUCY (shouting) Edmund! 
MR. BEAVER Shh! They'll hear ya! 
Peter starts to run after Edmund but Mr. Beaver grabs him by the sleeve of his coat 
PETER Get off me! 
PETER We just can't let him go! 
BEAVER Don't you get it?! He's the bait! She wants all of ya in there!!! To kill ya! 
SUSAN This is all your fault! None of this would have happened if you had just listened to me in the first place! 
PETER So you knew this would happen? 
SUSAN I didn't know what would happen... 
WHITE WITCH Couldn't even do that! 
EDMUND I...I did bring them half way. There at the dam at the house of the beaver's! 
WHITE WITCH Well...I guess your not a total lost then. 
Edmund approaches again. 
EDMUND Is there any chance I may have some more Turkish delight now? 
WHITE WITCH Ginnabrick, our guest is hungry 
GINNABRICK This way...for your num nums... 
WHITE WITCH Maugrim!!!! You know what to do.... 
Maugrim let's out a howl, Edmund realizes the horrible truth as wolves surround the castle...they charge from the castle 
BACK AT THE BEAVERS HOUSE 
MAUGRIM Take them 
MR.BEAVER Hurry Mum, they are after us! 
MRS. BEAVER right then... 
SUSAN What is she doing? 
MRS. BEAVER Don't worry, you'll thank you me later. it's a long journey and a beaver gets cranky when he's hungry. 
BEAVER I'M CRANKY NOW! 
SUSAN Do you think we should bring jam? 
PETER Only if the Witch has toast. 
GOES INSIDE THE TUNNEL 
MR. BEAVER This should lead to Aslan's 
FOX Humans in Narnia, now that's some valuable information 
MAUGRIM Where are they?!!! 
Lucy cries out, Peter shushes her 
the fox looks around hopelessly, and then hangs his head in shame 
FOX They , they , were heading North. 
MAUGRIM Quickly, smell them out. 
they cast aside the fox , where he lays whimpering on the ground 
Mrs. Beaver is patching up the Fox, as the children listen to his tale 
LUCY are you all right? 
FOX Well, I wish I could say their bark was worse than their bite. 
He winces in pain, and continues to talk 
MRS. BEAVER Stop squirming! You're worse than beaver on bath day 
MR. BEAVER Worst day of the year 
FOX Well I am afraid that is all the healing I have time for. 
SUSAN You're leaving? 
FOX It has been a pleasure my Queen. I have been asked by Aslan HIMSELF to gather more troops. 
MR. BEAVER You've seen Aslan! 
MRS. BEAVER What is He like? 
FOX Like everything we have ever heard. He'll be a good help fighting the White Witch 
SUSAN We are not planning fighting any witch 
WHITE WITCH Guard! 
GUARD Yes, your majesty 
WHITE WITCH Release the Faun (Guard hit chains and Tumnus cries out in pain as they drop him by the Witch) Do you know why you are here? 
MR. TUMNUS Because I believe in a free Narnia 
Witch stares at him coldly 
WHITE WITCH You're here because he (points at Edmund) turned you in...for sweeties. (turns to dwarf and guard) Take him (Tumnus) upstairs and ready my sleigh, Edmund misses his family. 
THE ROCK BRIDGE 
MR. BEAVER Now Aslan's camp is just over there by the stone table just across the frozen river. 
SUSAN River? 
MRS. BEAVER It's been frozen for 100 years 
PETER It seems so far 
MRS. BEAVER It's the world dear, did you expect it to be small? 
SUSAN Smaller... 
They continue their journey. 
BACK TO EDMUND 
Dwarf brings Edmund up and he sees Tumnus turned to stone 
WHITE WITCH Whenever you are ready Son-of-Adam. 
Sleigh goes off into forest with Edmund looking at the cold White Witch 
FATHER CHRISTMAS 
MR. BEAVER Come on, before we're old 
LUCY Presents! 
FATHER CHRISTMAS Lucy, Eve's Daughter. These are for you. The juice of the fire flower. If you, or one of your friends are wounded, one drop of this cordial will restore them. And though I do not expect you to use it, this. 
LUCY Well, I think I could be brave enough. 
FATHER CHRISTMAS I'm sure you could. But battles are ugly affairs. Eve's Daughter, Susan. Trust in this bow, for it does not easily miss. 
SUSAN What happened to, 'battles are ugly affairs?' 
FATHER CHRISTMAS And, though you don't seem to have trouble making yourself heard, this. When you put this horn to your lips and blow it, wherever you are, help will come. 
SUSAN Thanks. 
FATHER CHRISTMAS And, Peter. These are tools, not toys. The time to use them may be soon at hand. 
FATHER CHRISTMAS Bare them well! I best be off, winter is almost over and things do pile up when you've been gone a thousand years. Long live Aslan! (he gets in his sleigh and rides off) 
THE CHILDREN Bye... Merry Christmas! 
LUCY Told you he was real! 
PETER Did you hear what he said... winter is almost over. You no what that means... no more ice! 
CROSSING THE RIVER 
SUSAN Wait, maybe we should think about this. 
PETER We don't have time. 
SUSAN I was just trying to be realistic 
PETER No, you're trying to be smart...as usual! 
CROSSING THE ICE 
MR. BEAVER Wait, maybe I should go first. 
PETER Maybe you should. 
ASLAN What's done is done. There is no reason to bring up the past with your brother. 
EDMUND Hello... 
LUCY Oh, Edmund (Hugs him and Susan does too) 
SUSAN How are you feeling? 
EDMUND I'm feeling kinda tired 
PETER Get some rest...and Edmund try not to wander off again. 
Some time later, breakfast 
LUCY Narnia isn't going to run out of toast Edmund 
PETER then you better pack some for the journey 
SUSAN So were going home? 
PETER You are, I promised I'd keep you three safe but there's no reason I can't stay and help. 
LUCY but they need us...All four of us 
PETER Lucy it's too dangerous. You almost drowned, Edmund was almost killed! 
EDMUND Which is why we have to stay. 
They all look at him. 
EDMUND I've seen what the White Witch can do and I've helped her do it, and we can't leave these people behind to suffer for it. 
Lucy holds Ed's hand. 
SUSAN Well I guess that's it then. *gets up* 
PETER Where are you going? 
SUSAN (picks up bow and quiver) To get in some practice. 
Narnians cheer. 
WHITE WITCH How will I know your promise will be kept? 
Aslan roars. the White Witch falls into her seat and the Narnians laugh. The White Witch leaves. Aslan sighs and walks into his tent. 
THAT NIGHT... 
Lucy is quietly resting, when she see's a shadow...she wakes Susan 
LUCY Susan! 
Susan see's the shadow, the two leave their tent. Aslan is leaving the camp...they follow him. and follow him...and follow him. Until- 
ASLAN Aren't you suppose to be in bed? 
LUCY We couldn't sleep 
SUSAN Please, Aslan. Couldn't we come with you? 
ASLAN I would be glad of the company tonight. 
(Walk further) 
ASLAN It is time. From now on, I must go on alone. Thank you Susan. Thank you Lucy. And farewell. 
LUCY (later after lots of jeers towards Aslan as he walks to the Stone Table) Why doesn't he fight back? 
WHITE WITCH Bind him. Wait. First let him be shaved. 
More jeers and catcalls... 
WHITE WITCH Tonight, the Deep magic will be appeased, but tomorrow, we will take Narnia, Forever! 
WHITE WITCH You know, Aslan, I'm a little disappointed in you. Did you really think that by giving your life you would save the Human boy? Ha. You are giving up your life, and saving no one. So much for love. 
WHITE WITCH In that knowledge... Despair... and DIE!!!!!! 
She plunges in the knife and Aslan's growls in pain and his eyes slowly close 
GRYPHON They come, you highness, in numbers and weapons far greater then our own. 
OREIUS Numbers do not win a battle 
PETER No, but I bet they help 
Arrival of the Witch's army 
WHITE WITCH I take no interest in prisoners. Kill them all 
Army charges, gryphons attack 
OTMAN Look to the sky 
BATTLE TRULY BEGINS 
PETER Are you with me? 
ORIEUS To the death! 
PETER FOR NARNIA, AND FOR ASLAN!!!! 
PETER'S CHARGE BEGINS 
Back to the girls at the Stone Table 
Lucy and Susan wake up. 
SUSAN We should go. 
LUCY I'm so cold. 
They start walking away...Stone Table cracks 
LUCY Susan! 
SUSAN What have they done? 
Aslan appears, sending shivers down EVERYONE'S spine! 
ASLAN Come, lets search the castle - others may still be trapped inside and Peter will need all the help he can get. 
BACK TO THE BATTLE 
PETER Ed! There are too many of them! Go! Get out of here! Get the girls, and get them home! 
BEAVER Come on, you heard him! 
Ed starts to leave, then sees the Witch. And starts to go back 
BEAVER Peter said to go! 
EDMUND Peter's not King yet! 
Edmund rushes down the hill and breaks the witch's sword, then she stabs him with the remainders of her wand. so the next thing that is actually said is a grunt issued from Edmund and... 
PETER Edmund!!(silenced) 
Peter and the Witch fight, then they see Aslan 
WITCH Impossible! 
Aslan rushes to kill the Witch, everything disappears 
ASLAN It is finished. 
The three Pevensies reunite 
SUSAN Where's Edmund? 
The dwarf hobbles up and is about to finish Edmund 
SUSAN Edmund! (shoots arrow, kills the dwarf) 
Edmund coughs and gasps. Lucy pulls out her cordial and places one drop on Edmund's lips. He stops moving momentarily before gasping and sitting up 
PETER When are you ever going to do are you're told? 
Laughing and hugging  Group Hug Lucy gets the idea to heal everyone and she walks over too someone else who is hurt. Then you see Cair Paravel, and horns blowing. The coronation of the Pevensies began. They walk up the aisle happily, and stand next to their cool chairs.

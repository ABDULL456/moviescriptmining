(SWEET) Listen, Marky, you made a mistake. You're human. I'm human. And this time it was you. Maybe six months from now, you'll walk in on me. I don't know, but probably. Sheila SNEEZES again. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Shut the fuck up. (then, to Mark, sweet) And. maybe I'm talking crazy, but I don't want to throw away our life together over something like this. We're getting married! I'm willing to fight for us. 
MARK I'm not. And you know why? Because Sheila loves me -- and not just for my money. Sheila squeezes his shoulder. 
ELIZABETH I'm sorry if I care that my future husband can support me. We didn't all grow up with a silver spoon in our mouths. You can't even imagine what it's like going to bed hungry, night after night. 
MARK What are you talking about?! Both your parents are CPAs. 
ELIZABETH My parents worked their asses off to send me to private school. Do you know what it's like driving a Pontiac when everyone else gets a Beemer the second they menstruate? That shit stays with you. 
MARK It's over, Elizabeth. 
ELIZABETH For the record, there's a shitload of things that I hate about you, but I still, would've gotten married. (beat, sweet) Because I love you. 
MARK (rolls his eyes) I'm gonna need the ring back. She grabs her bag and heads for the exit. Mark follows. 
ELIZABETH You sad little troll! I hope you and your hooker enjoy chlamydia together! 
MARK Elizabeth. The ring. 
ELIZABETH (not turning around) I'm not even listening to you anymore. She starts to open the door. He closes it. The ring! 
ELIZABETH Like I even want your gay-ass ring. She tries pulling it off. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) It's not coming off. I'll go to the jeweler's tomorrow. Mark takes her hand and removes the ring with ease. Elizabeth steps out into the night. The door SLAMS behind her. 
CHYRON: 3 MONTHS LATER 
EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY 
A red 1994 Grand Am with a cracked windshield peels into the half-empty lot and screeches to a halt. The license plate reads "HERS." 
INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 
Elizabeth walks down the empty hall. It's possible a person has never looked less happy to be anywhere. FAINT SOFT ROCK plays from an open door. Something from inside the classroom catches Elizabeth's eye. 
ELIZABETH (under her breath) You've gotta be shitting me. 
TURN TO REVEAL 
AMY'S CLASSROOM The room has been decorated to within an inch of its life. Every surface is covered with posters like "Noted African-Americans," or "Hispanic American Hall of Fame," or "Women Who Dared." A RED DELICIOUS APPLE has been placed on each student's desk. Amy, dressed casually in cargo shorts and texas, is trying to hang a large "INTEGRITY" poster. She looks over, sees Elizabeth staring at her, and immediately lights up. 
AMY Elizabeth Halsey, as I live and breathe! 
ELIZABETH Amy Squirrel. 
AMY I know we barely got a chance to get to know one another last year -- what with you planning the wedding of the century and me juggling all my extra-currics -- but I just want to say that I'm super excited to be across-the-hall-mates. 
ELIZABETH Okay. 
AMY And I know you kinda skated by last year, doing the bare minimum thing -- you were kind of a lone wolf -- but now you're back and I just know that you are going to rededicate yourself to the task at -- Amy notices Elizabeth's bare hands. 
AMY (CONT'D) Where's your beautiful ring? 
ELIZABETH My fiance and I broke it off. I found him in bed with someone else. Oh my gosh! 
ELIZABETH It was another man. 
AMY 
(INCREDULOUS) Shut the front door! (motioning for a hug) Somebody needs a hug. 
ELIZABETH Somebody doesn't. 
AMY Hm. Another time then. Elizabeth takes an apple from a desk. 
ELIZABETH Yeah, I'm not going to that. 
LYNN But it's mandatory. 
ELIZABETH ("I'm so scared") Ooohhh... 
LYNN Yeah, I probably won't go either. I don't know I might. I'll probably go, but just sit in the back. Maybe leave early. Maybe stay till the end. Play it by ear. Or just stay till the end. Lynn takes both their, trays and dumps them. 
LYNN (CONT'D) This was fun. 
ELIZABETH Yeah, it was alright. When you said you were taking me to lunch, I kinda thought it was going to be nicer, but this was okay. 
LYNN Sorry. 
ELIZABETH It's okay. You can get me next time. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Not much character, not many furnishings. 
Elizabeth is online looking at a PORN SITE. She stares at the SCREEN and compares breasts to the ones in US Weekly. She reaches for a bong and pulls a huge hit. The front door opens and her roommate, KIRK, early 30s, boarish and carrying a tattered backpack and a Big Gulp, walks quickly past Elizabeth. 
ELIZABETH Hey, Kirk, what do you think about me with Jessica Simpson's tits? He stares at her chest intently. She's not bothered by it. Go bigger. Kirk enters his bedroom and slams the door. 
ELIZABETH Cool, yeah. She glances at the clock: 3:14 AM. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (under her breath) Fuck my ass. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Elizabeth is asleep. After a beat, the ALARM goes off. She checks the clock: 5.:15. She groans. 
INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 
First day of school excitement. The bell RINGS, and like rats, the KIDS scurry to their various classes. Before long, the hallway is empty. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - MORNING 
In one corner, CHASE, clearly at the top of the seventh grade food chain, shows off a photo spread of herself modelling in a "Western-Style" clothing catalogue. GARRETT, 12, wearing grey, stained sweatpants and a grey sweatshirt with block letters that read "GYMNASTICS," stares longingly at Chase from a few desks away. 
CHASE The photographer was, like, sooo nice. He made me feel sooo comfortable. 
(THEN) I might get flown to Kansas City for their fashion week. 
GARRETT 
(RIVETED) Oh my. Chase and her friends turn to face Garrett, who's as surprised as they are that he spoke. 
CHASE Stalk much? Garrett quickly turns away. Chase rolls her eyes. An angry-looking kid, TRISTAN, wearing a MICHAEL VICK JERSEY, turns to Garrett. 
TRISTAN 
(FAKE SNEEZING) Faggot. 
GARRETT 
(EARNEST) Bless you. 
TRISTAN What'd you say to me? Elizabeth, with large bags under her eyes, enters the class. Tristan, on a dime, heads back to his seat. The class immediately quiets down. SASHA, 12, dressed like a paralegal, walks up to Elizabeth with a large Tupperware tray. 
SASHA Hi, I'm Sasha. It's a pleasure to meet you. (handing over tupperware) My mother baked these for you. 
ELIZABETH (not looking up) Just leave them on the desk. Sasha, confused, gently puts them down and stands there. After a moment, Elizabeth looks up. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) You need something? 
- Sasha shakes her head and retreats to her desk at the front of the class. 
Empty. Elizabeth looks around and spots the "INTEGRITY" poster on the wall. She walks over and studies it. 
INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 
Elizabeth walks down the hallway with the rolled up poster. She. passes a man, obviously lost, looking at a map. This is SCOTT, 30. Handsome in a wholesome way. Elizabeth walks by as he looks up at her helplessly. She turns on her heels. Fresh fish. 
ELIZABETH 
(VERY FRIENDLY) Hi there. You look a little lost. 
SCOTT Hi. Can you tell me where Room 124 is? 
ELIZABETH I'll do you one better. I'll take you there. 
SCOTT Oh, you don't have to do that. 
ELIZABETH Will you stop? It'd be my pleasure. 
SCOTT Thanks! I feel like I've been walking around in circles for the last fifteen minutes. 
(EXTENDS HAND) Scott Delacorte. I'm the new sub. 
ELIZABETH Elizabeth Halsey, 7th Grade Language Arts. Welcome, welcome. They shake hands a beat too long. Elizabeth notices Scott's VERY EXPENSIVE WATCH. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Helluva watch. What's that -- a Jaeger- LeCoultre? 
SCOTT Good eye! 
ELIZABETH Thanks. I love men's watches. It's kind of a hobby. 
SCOTT It's a bummer knowing my watch could feed a village for .a year, but my grandfather designed it, so... 
ELIZABETH Oh? Your grandfather designs watches? 
SCOTT The family business. My mom's maiden name is Jaeger. 
ELIZABETH Shut up! 
SCOTT My parents had a minor meltdown when I decided to join the Peace Corps and become a teacher. But they've been cool about it. Elizabeth smiles and they start walking down the hall. 
SCOTT (CONT'D) Integrity. 
ELIZABETH 
SCOTT (pointing to poster).. The poster. "Integrity." What a great message for the kids. 
ELIZABETH That's why I got it. They turn a corner. Garrett wheels his backpack past them. 
GARRETT Hey, Ms. Halsey! 
ELIZABETH Hey... dude... She slaps him five. Scott notices, smiles. 
SCOTT Man, I can't wait for the day that I have my own classroom. 
ELIZABETH Yeah... So did you and your wife just move to town? 
SCOTT I'm not married. 
ELIZABETH Me neither. I was engaged until I walked in on my fiance cheating on me. With his brother. 
SCOTT That's horrible! 
(NOTICING) Ooh, 124! This is me. 
ELIZABETH Nice to meet you, Scott Delacourte. Hopefully, we'll be seeing a lot of each other. 
SCOTT 
(LEANING IN) You know, there are less expensive options. Have you looked into South America? 
ELIZABETH I'll be back. Elizabeth dramatically scoops a handful of mints from the bowl and storms out. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Elizabeth, her cell phone cradled to her ear, pulls a LEAN CUISINE out of a freezer STOCKED with them. 
ELIZABETH 
(ON PHONE) Look, I just really need some money. It's, for a surgery I need. Elizabeth pokes holes in the Lean Cuisine with a knife and turns on the microwave. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) 
(ON PHONE) Yes, as a matter of fact, it is about my breasts, dad. 
(BEAT) Sorry. Happy belated birthday. So, can you wire me some money or not? 
EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT 
Elizabeth walks up a driveway and looks around. 
ELIZABETH (on phone, whispering) So I won't beat around the bush, Grammy. She pulls the kitchen knife from her bag and SLASHES the back tire of a late-model CAMRY. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (on phone, whispering) I'm dying and I need money for surgery. Really? Nothing? Don't you get social security or something? Elizabeth goes around to another tire. Slash. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - LATER 
Elizabeth is still on the phone. CLOSE ON her computer screen. Her checking account balance: $45.66. 
ELIZABETH (into phone, losing patience) Listen, limpdick, you owe me for breaking off the engagement. Do you know how embarrassing that was?! 
(BEAT) Lover, I don't want to fight. It's just 10000 dollars and it would really mean the world to me. Lover? You there? Elizabeth hurls her phone at the wall. It smashes. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Fucking Troll! Kirk pokes his head out of his bedroom. 
KIRK Did you call my name? 
ELIZABETH No. I said 'fucking troll.' 
KIRK Oh, I thought you said Kirk. He turns and heads back in to his room. 
ELIZABETH Hey, you got ten grand? 
KIRK Nope. Kirk closes his door. After a beat, he opens it. 
KIRK (CONT'D) Also, I might be a little short on the rent this month. Like, a lot short. 
He closes his door. The microwave BEEPS. Dinner's ready. 
INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY 
Elizabeth and Lynn speak in hushed voices in the corner by a vending machine. Amy grades papers on a ratty- looking couch. She glances up at Elizabeth and Lynn. 
LYNN I don't know. That's a lot of money. 
ELIZABETH I know. And I hate asking a friend for money -- especially as good a friend as you. This has its desired effect on Lynn. 
LYNN Maybe I could sell that jewelry my grandmother gave me? 
ELIZABETH That turquoise crap? Blech. No one's buying that. (then, catching herself) But it looks great on you. 
LYNN Thanks. What about Mark? 
ELIZABETH What type of person do you think I am?! That assbag cheated on me. Did I ever tell you that he has a mole on the tip of his dick? 
ELIZABETH I'm just trying to better myself. I don't think that's asking for so much. Amy walks over. 
INT. J.A.M.S. - ADMINISTRATION BULLPEN - DAY 
Elizabeth walks past the SCHOOL SECRETARY toward the Principal's office. 
SCHOOL SECRETARY You can't go in there. He's with a student. Elizabeth ignores her, adjusts her blouse, and enters. 
INT. J.A.M.S. - PRINCIPAL SNUR'S OFFICE - DAY 
The office is decorated with a DOLPHIN motif. Figurines, a picture of Principal Snur kissing a dolphin. Dolphin calendars. This guy loves dolphins. Principal Snur sits next to ARKADY, a small pale kid. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR If you don't like to get wet, Arkady, you could try using deodorant, anti-. perspirant, maybe some cologne. I know a lot of the older boys are wearing the body spray. 
ARKADY 
(BROKEN ENGLISH) Bodish spray. Elizabeth enters and immediately recoils from the smell. 
ELIZABETH Blugh! Arkady and Principal Snur both look up. He holds up his finger -- "one minute." Elizabeth notices his cheap dolphin watch. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR So why don't you think about that and I'll let your teachers know that you're working on it? Arkady nods and quickly exits. 
ELIZABETH Sorry, I didn't realize you were in with anyone. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR We were just finishing up. Elizabeth, I actually meant to talk to you. Did I hear that you were showing movies all last week? 
ELIZABETH Um... some clips, maybe. I think in a lot, of ways, movies are the new books. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR Huh. Elizabeth tries a different tact. She picks up a dolphin- shaped clock from the desk. 
ELIZABETH Is this new? I love it! I think dolphins are smarter than humans. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR Me too! And if you like that, you'll love this. 
Principal Snur pulls out an "Adopt-A-Dolphin" certificate. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT`D) He lives in the Cayman Islands. 
ELIZABETH What a great story. Principal Snur visibly relaxes. He's sitting across from a kindred spirit. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR So what else is new? 
ELIZABETH Actually, I was thinking that I want to get more involved. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR What a nice surprise. 
ELIZABETH Specifically, I thought I could supervise the car wash. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR Amy's been running it the last two years... 
ELIZABETH She just does so much. It might be nice to give her a little rest. Especially that early on a Saturday. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR I'm so happy that you're dedicating yourself and becoming a real member of the JAMS family. 
ELIZABETH It just feels so good to help. 
MATCH CUT TO: 
INT. J.A.M.S. - PRINCIPAL SNUR'S OFFICE - DAY 
Amy stands in the door where Elizabeth was just standing. Principal Snur is behind his desk. 
AMY Elizabeth?! For the seventh grade carwash? That's bonkers! 
Amy immediately regrets saying "bonkers." 
AMY (CONT'D) I'm sorry. I didn't mean to blow my stack. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR I just thought it was nice to see some other teachers step up. 
PRINCIPAL:SNUR 
(TO HIMSELF) Amazing. 
AMY (O.S.) Wally? Are you in here? It's Amy Squirrel. He instinctively covers himself with the brochure. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR Amy? What are you doing? Get out! 
INTERCUT WITH: Amy standing inside. She scrunches her nose at the smell. 
AMY This'll just take a sec. I thought you might want to know that Elizabeth Halsey showed up at the carwash in a bikini top and short-shorts. It was pretty racy stuff. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR 
(THRU STALL) Can we talk about this later? 
AMY (quoting some adage) "Later we'll all die, said the gator to the fly." 
Another TEACHER walks past Amy, looking confused. He hesitates and then goes into an adjoining stall. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR Look, Josh Gershman's dad called and said that the carwash was a huge success. And Lauren Rissman's dad called and said the kids had a great time. 
AMY I don't want to speak out of school, but I happened to be pedalling by and saw her get.pretty chummy with the money. ,And remember, we barely know anything about her. She was a real lone wolf last year. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR Are you accusing Elizabeth of embezzling from the seventh grade car wash? 
AMY Something about this doesn't pass the smell test, Wally. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR Well, they raised over $7000, so whatever she did worked. And next time you accuse a fellow teacher of stealing, you better be damn sure. We're done here. Amy takes a deep breath. Her face is BEET RED. 
AMY Thanks for the pep talk. Have a super day, you two. Amy exits. Immediately, there is an IMMENSE ERUPTION from the other stall, followed by a sigh. 
MALE TEACHER (O.S.) 
(IN STALL) Christ... I thought she was never going to leave. 
INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY 
Sandy, the math teacher with the ponytail, sits at the table grading papers. Another TEACHER dozes in the corner. 
ELIZABETH (entering, very friendly) Hey! Are those new Doc Marten's? 
Sandy looks behind him at the dozing teacher. "Is she talking to me?" Guilty. 
ELIZABETH How's Period 5? 
SANDY Great, thanks for asking. We got a new bassist and we finally got a regular gig, which is nice because it's earned. It's time to show the world that a bunch of teachers can really rock out. 
ELIZABETH Awesome! 
(THEN) Hey, would you mind grabbing me my yogurt from the fridge? Sure thing. Sandy goes to the fridge. Elizabeth pulls visine from her bag, and as his head goes into the fridge, she squirts the entire container into his coffee mug. 
SANDY (CONT'D) You should come to one of our shows. He hands her the yogurt. 
ELIZABETH Oh, I can't. Elizabeth exits. Sandy sadly takes a sip of his coffee. 
SANDY I didn't even tell you the dates. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY 
Elizabeth's class is seated. They're staring at her, waiting for her to begin. 
CHASE Are we starting "School Ties" today? Elizabeth holds up her finger while she finishes reading a 
NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC. 
The camera ANGLES to show that she is studying a picture of a topless AFRICAN TRIBESWOMAN with large breasts. After a beat, Elizabeth looks up. 
ELIZABETH (news to her) Yeah, Silly, I meant after. 
SCOTT Cool! Let's get a group together. 
ELIZABETH Yeah, definitely! Or just the two of us. Scott looks around, then lowers his voice. 
SCOTT Oh. Um, listen, I'm really flattered. You're one of the nicest people I've met here. But... I'm actually seeing someone. 
ELIZABETH Oh? 
SCOTT Yeah, we've been keeping it quiet. 
ELIZABETH Because she's ugly? 
SCOTT No. She's beautiful. She's great. She really cares about the kids. It's just... when you're dating a co-worker... 
ELIZABETH 
(REALIZING) Squirrel? Elizabeth whips around to see Amy, who's now sharing a frozen yogurt with the formerly bawling girl. Amy looks up, smiles and gives a thumbs up to Elizabeth and Scott, signalling that everything's okay with the girl. Elizabeth NOTICES Amy's LARGE BREASTS straining against her blouse. She quietly seethes. 
SCOTT Anyways, thanks again for asking me out. I'm honored. And I'll take a raincheck on that group date. See ya! Scott crosses through the cafeteria. Lynn returns with a four cartons of milk. 
LYNN Here you go. I got you one of each. 
Lynn hands them to Elizabeth, who takes them, drops them in the trash and storms off. 
EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT 
At night, under the stars, the SCHOOL looks peaceful, serene. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - NIGHT 
Elizabeth is up front. She's staring,at the PARENTS. They stare right back at her. It's awkwardly silent for a beat too long. 
ELIZABETH Hi, my name's Elizabeth Halsey. Soooooo... Any questions? Sasha's Mother eagerly raises her hand. Elizabeth points to her. 
SASHA'S MOTHER Hi, I'm Sasha's mother. We waved to each other at the carwash. I'm a little concerned with the importance you're placing on movies. What about the state test? Elizabeth points to her sign on the wall -- "Don't Question My Authority." 
ELIZABETH That's exactly what I say to my students. Listen, I'm a good teacher. And the school hired me because I'm good at what I do. (as the parents take this in) And the reason your son loves my class is because I inspire him. Movies are one tool that I use. I also use other multimedia techniques, which I'm not going to get into right now. Look, I could take you day by day through my entire syllabus, but that's not how I do things. I'm not one of these stuffy teachers who's totally by the book. I talk to the kids like they're little adults. It's about mutual respect. So that's my spiel, as the Jews say. 
(THEN) Help yourselves to some delicious snacks and drinks in the back. Class dismissed. They head to the back of the class. ANGLE ON 
A "refreshments" table. A lonely package of OREOS rests against a PITCHER OF TAP WATER. Elizabeth tries to sneak out the door, but is stopped by a sharply dressed PARENT. 
PARENT #1 Excuse me, Ms. Halsey. 
(EXTENDING HAND) I'm Chris' dad. From Elizabeth's reaction, she clearly has no idea who Chris is. 
ELIZABETH Chris... Great kid -- and precocious. You must be so proud. 
CHRIS' DAD Oh, what a relief. I just wish his grades would reflect it. 
ELIZABETH If I know Chris, he'll get there. 
CHRIS' DAD Listen, I know you have a full plate, but if you could keep an eye on Chris, my wife and I would really appreciate it. Chris' dad shakes her hand. Elizabeth opens her hand, sees a tightly folded HUNDRED DOLLAR bill. She looks back up at Chris' dad. 
CHRIS' DAD (CONT'D) 
(WINKING) For supplies. Or whatever. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Elizabeth stands with another set of parents. They're eating Oreos and sipping water. 
ELIZABETH You're Chase's parents? Great kid -- and precocious. You must be so proud. The parents beam. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The SONG continues as Elizabeth throws more money in her "New Tits" jar and enters a new amount into her notebook. The new balance: $1473. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY 
"Gangster's Paradise" CONTINUES and we see that the class is now watching "Dangerous Minds" with Michelle Pfeiffer as a tough-as-nails teacher in an inner-city school. 
INT. AMY'S CLASSROOM - SAME 
The SONG continues as Amy, in her empty classroom, stands against the adjoining wall, her ear pressed to it. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - ANOTHER DAY 
The SONG continues. The class is still watching "Dangerous Minds." There's some NOISE in the hall. Elizabeth PAUSES the movie, STOPPING the song. She leans into the hall. 
ELIZABETH Enough with the commotion! The hallway goes silent. She comes back in and UNPAUSES the movie. The SONG comes back on. 
INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 
The SONG continues as the hallway fills with excited kids, who race down the hall and talk animatedly with friends. Elizabeth pushes through the center. 
EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY 
The SONG continues. Elizabeth sits in her car. She lights a joint with the cigarette lighter and deeply inhales. KNOCK KNOCK! The SONG abruptly ENDS. Elizabeth jumps. She turns to her window, sees Sasha, bundled in her winter coat, waving. 
ELIZABETH (through the window) What do you want? Sasha motions for her to roll down the window. Elizabeth doesn't. 
SASHA Is that marijuana? 
ELIZABETH It is. But it's medicinal. Doctor gave it to me. Not that it's any of your business. 
SASHA Oh, okay. Feel better. 
(THEN) My mom and I made you holiday cookies. Here. Sasha pulls out a tupperware container. 
ELIZABETH (peering through window) Are those oatmeal raisin? 
SASHA Sugar. Elizabeth considers, then manually rolls down the window a crack. She grabs the container and quickly closes her window. Elizabeth starts eating a cookie. 
ELIZABETH You have anything to drink? Sasha shakes her head. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Word to the wise: stop dressing like you're running for congress. 
SASHA I don't want to run for congress. I want to be president. 
ELIZABETH See? That's what I'm talking about. Keep saying stuff like that, you're gonna get punched. You really want to be President or is that what your parents tell to be? Sasha shrugs. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) You don't have to decide right now. Who knows? Maybe you wake up one day and decide that you love giving massages and you want to be a masseuse. Salary plus tips. Think about it. 
SASHA If I think about it, will I get extra credit? 
ELIZABETH (shakes her head) Hopeless. Watch your feet. 
Elizabeth reverses. Sasha jumps away from the car. Elizabeth peels out, passing the school marquee that reads, "Happy Holidays, Jammers! See you in '09!" 
INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY 
Elizabeth rolls over. It's 3:40 PM. She yawns and gets out of bed. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - DAY 
QUICK CUTS. Elizabeth opens her refrigerator. Nothing except ketchup packets, mustard packets and soy sauce packets. She reaches for her bong and tries lighting it. Once. Twice. She shakes the lighter. No luck. She carries the bong to the stove, turns on the stove, and tries lighting it from there. No luck. 
ELIZABETH Seriously? 
EXT. LIQUOR STORE - AFTERNOON 
INT. J.A.M.S. - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAWN 
The sun is breaking. 
INT. AMY'S CAR - SAME 
Amy listens to NPR as she pulls into the empty parking lot. Suddenly, she SLAMS on her brakes. ELIZABETH'S CAR is already there. Amy puts her car in park and gets out. She walks over to Elizabeth's car and feels the hood. 
AMY Cold. 
INT. J.A.M.S. - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
The clicking of Amy's shoes ECHO through the empty hallway. She stops, takes off her shoes. She pitter-patters down the hall to Elizabeth's classroom and PEERS in. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - SAME 
Elizabeth is at the chalkboard, intently writing questions. She senses something in her periphery and looks over at her window. Nothing. Elizabeth goes back to work. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - LATER 
Elizabeth waits in the doorway impatiently as the kids filter in. Garrett brings up the rear, rolling his backpack into class. 
ELIZABETH 
(TO GARRETT) Let's go, Sylvia Plath. Garrett rolls his backpack over Elizabeth's shoe.. Elizabeth winces and glares at Garrett. The rest of the class enters, stops, noticing WORK PACKETS on each of their desks. 
CHASE 
(LOOKING AROUND) Where's the TV? 
ELIZABETH 
(ALL BUSINESS) Everyone, take your seats. Shawn turns to Spencer. 
SHAWN What do you think's going on? Spencer shrugs. 
ELIZABETH Come on, come on. We have a lot to cover so sit down. The class, still confused, quickly take their seats. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Alright then. Now. Open your To'Kill A Mockingbird to page one. The kids slowly take out their books. We HEAR the distinct sound of twenty-five book spines cracking as they're opened for the first time. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (checking her notes) Good. Now, who can tell me why Jem cries when the hole in the tree is filled with cement? Anyone? 
GARRETT Because she's a cry baby. The kids chuckle. Chase looks back at Garrett. 
ELIZABETH 
(TO GARRETT) Get out. Garrett clicks up the handle on his bag and heads for the door. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) We're here to learn. Anyone else have a problem with that? Good. So who has the answer to my question? Everyone looks down. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Nobody's read this book? It's on the syllabus. 
SASHA (raising hand and answering) You never assigned it to us. 
ELIZABETH Well, now I am. And we're having a quiz tomorrow. Panic. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) On the first hundred pages. 
PANDEMONIUM. 
SASHA You can't do that! I have band and jazz band tonight! 
SHAWN We haven't had homework all year! 
ELIZABETH Hey! Zip your shit! We've fallen behind, and honestly, your practice tests scores sucked balls -- which was embarrassing to me both on a personal level and as an educator. 
(BEAT) Things are about to change. Recess is over. 
(LOOKING DOWN) Oh shit. Hold on. Elizabeth turns away from them and starts rebuttoning. Sandy tries to sneak a peek. Scott shoots him a dirty look. Sandy gives an innocent shrug. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (grabs yogurt from fridge) I've just been such a mess the last few days. Working myself to the bone. 
AMY Yeah, it's been quite a change. 
SCOTT. Well, I think it's great. Some teachers just sail by, doing the bare minimum. It's good to know there are still some actual educators out there. Elizabeth smiles for Scott, like, "You get me." 
ELIZABETH Well, I should get going. Nice seeing all of you. Amy and Elizabeth smile thinly at one another. Elizabeth squeezes Scott's shoulder as she exits. Amy notices. 
SCOTT 
(RE ELIZABETH) What a good egg. 
INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - LATER 
Amy and Sasha sit in the empty auditorium. Sasha is dressed as LITTLE ORPHAN ANNIE, including the RED WIG." Student STAGEHANDS construct a set. 
AMY What else, Sasha? 
SASHA I don't know. I told you about the car wash money. 
AMY I can't prove that. What else? 
SASHA I think I've told you everything. 
AMY And no more movies in class? 
SASHA No, we're actually learning. Did you know that Animal Farm isn't even really about animals -- 
AMY 
(SNAPPING) Animal Farm?! That's not even on the syllabus! 
(MORE) 
AMY (CONT'D) (then, collecting herself) I know you're forgetting something. Do you want extra credit on your diorama or not? 
SASHA I want it! Let me think... Oh there was... never mind. 
AMY What? 
SASHA It was okay. It was medicinal. 
AMY Wait. Hold your horses. What was medicinal? 
SASHA Ms. Halsey was smoking in her car, but she told me her doctor prescribed it. 
AMY 
(TO HERSELF) Holy guacamole.

POLICE OFFICER #1 (to German Shepherd, coaxing) Come on, Axel, what do you smell, boy? The Police Officers continue the search. They lead the dogs up against lockers and knock on class doors. Amy and Principal Snur watch from the end of the hallway. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR 
(TO AMY) You better be right about this -- or I'm going to be getting a lot of panicked calls from parents. 
AMY Trust me, Wally. My kids in D.A.R.E. tell me everything and there are drugs in this school. And not just the students. Some of the female teachers. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - THE NEXT DAY 
INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY 
The kids are laughing and engaged. TURN TO REVEAL SCOTT, dressed in overalls and a straw hat with a piece of hay in his mouth, animatedly teaching. He's holding a copy of "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer." 
ELIZABETH (V.0.) Yeah. So I'm off to the funeral. Wish me luck. 
EXT. SIGMA NU - MOMENTS LATER 
Elizabeth knocks on the door. A buff, shirtless guy in a backwards hat opens it. He likes what he sees. 
FRAT GUY Hi there. 
ELIZABETH Is Tucker here? 
FRAT GUY 
(DISAPPOINTED) Yeah, hold on. T-baaaaag! Someone's here. (then, back to Elizabeth) So you coming to our "CEOs and Corporate Ho's" party tonight? Elizabeth just stares at the Frat Guy. He turns away. Tucker, dressed identically to the Frat Guy but twenty pounds overweight, hustles down the stairs. He has a tattoo of intertwined teabags around his bicep. 
TUCKER 
INT. SIGMA NU - TUCKER'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Tucker sits on his bed. Elizabeth leans against a desk, unwilling to sit down on anything in his disgusting room. BOB MARLEY plays softly. 
TUCKER Do you ever talk to my brother? 
ELIZABETH No. He dumped me, remember? 
TUCKER You and my brother always had the histrionics. 
(THEN) So, do you want to come to our party tonight? "CEOs and Corporate Ho's?" We're kinda light on Ho's. 
ELIZABETH Like I told "Frat Guy #1," I'm not interested. 
TUCKER Then what's up? 
ELIZABETH I need some date rape drugs. 
TUCKER (hurt, defensive) Two things. Number one: who do you think I am? Yeah, I like to party and yeah, I'm in an awesome frat, but that really hurts. And two: they're not "date rape" drugs. It's called GHB -- and it's for weightlifting. It helps build mass, okay? Why do you even want it? 
ELIZABETH 
(DEADPAN) For lifting. 
(THEN) I have money and I'm in a rush. She takes out a wad of cash. 
TUCKER That's all you needed to say. No need to get all histrionic on me. Tucker walks over to a chest, opens it, and takes out a small lockbox. He unlocks it and takes out a small bottle containing a clear liquid. 
TUCKER (CONT'D) One capful makes you feel really good. Two capfuls will knock her out for a couple hours. You don't want to take any more than two. Elizabeth hands him some cash. He hands her the jar and then gives her a big, warm hug. 
TUCKER (CONT'D) Listen, I know you and my brother aren't together anymore, but I still think of you as a sister, okay? 
ELIZABETH Get your hand off my ass. 
TUCKER Sorry, didn't even know I put it down there. Good luck with your lifting. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S CAR - DAY 
As Elizabeth drives, we HEAR a phone RINGING. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) I.S.A.T. How can I direct your call? 
ELIZABETH (O.S.) Hi, my name is Marjorie Goodman and I'm calling from the Chicago Tribune. Who could I speak to regarding allegations of racial bias on your standardized tests? A beat. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Please hold. 
INT. T.G.I.FRIDAY'S - NIGHT 
ELIZABETH Well, that makes two of us. Elizabeth gives Carl "fuck me" eyes. He nervously sips his drink. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) What turns you on, Carl? 
CARL Everything. 
ELIZABETH You know what turns me on, Carl? He giggles nervously. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) 
(WHISPERS) Sex in an office. Getting fucked really, really hard against a wooden desk. 
CARL 
(SWALLOWS) Mine's metal. 
ELIZABETH Even better. 
INT. ILLINOIS STANDARDIZED TEST OFFICES - NIGHT 
Carl flips on the fluorescent lights and they flicker on, like dominoes across the ceiling. They enter his office and Carl awkwardly leans against the metal desk. 
CARL (gesturing, as promised) So this is the desk. 
ELIZABETH Do you have anything to drink? Carl goes to a mini-fridge and pulls out an already opened bottle of white wine. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) White wine in the office. You're a bad boy. Carl pours a glass. Elizabeth swigs from the bottle. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Do you have any music? 
CARL Um... I could put on some internet radio. Carl goes to fiddle with his computer. Elizabeth quickly reaches into her purse and pulls out the bottle of GHB. She pours a little into Carl's wine. And then a little bit more. As he turns around, she hands him the glass. 
ELIZABETH A toast. To new friends. 
CARL To new lovers. CLINK. Carl downs his glass. 
CARL (CONT'D) 
(NERVOUS) I'm gonna take off my shoes. Is that okay? 
ELIZABETH Whatever, man. I'm gonna hit the lady's room. 
CARL K, first door on your right. Don't be long. Carl starts carefully clearing everything off of his desk. 
INT. STANDARDIZED TEST OFFICES - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Elizabeth waits in the bathroom. Yawns. Checks her watch. 
INT. STANDARDIZED TEST OFFICES - LATER 
She walks back in. Carl looks woozy. The only thing keeping him from passing out is the prospect of seeing Elizabeth naked. 
CARL 
(SLURRING) I wanna fug ya agains dis desk. 
ELIZABETH Easy, Cowboy. Carl stumbles towards her. Elizabeth deftly moves around the desk and exits into the bullpen. 
CARL Marblorie! 
ELIZABETH (as to a child) Carl, I'm gonna need you to pass the fuck out. Carl smiles as he feebly chases after her. He. stops at the photocopier, steadies himself momentarily and then passes out, STILL STANDING. Elizabeth grabs the lanyard from Carl's neck and heads back into his office. She goes over to the filing cabinets, unlocks it with one of the keys, and starts rifling. She pulls out a folder. 
2009 ILLINOIS STANDARDIZED TEST 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) And bingo was his name-o. She walks over to the photocopier and pushes Carl over. He collapses on the ground -- out cold. She copies the test and puts it back and grabs a stack of scantrons from a shelf. She takes a post-it, scribbles something and sticks it to his forehead. As Elizabeth exits, the camera PUSHES IN: "You were AMAZING. Love, Marjorie." 
CUT TO: 
MAINTENANCE GUY What's wrong with your face? 
AMY What's wrong with your face?!?! 
MAINTENANCE GUY Just making conversation. He finds the right key and opens the desk. 
MAINTENANCE GUY (CONT'D) All set. 
AMY (buying it back) Super! Thanks a bunch, Amos! The Maintenance Man exits. Amy immediately opens the desk and rummages through it. She pulls out the "Annie" wig. 
AMY (CONT'D) Busted. She pulls out a test booklet. There's a piece ripped out from the front page. Amy's eyes narrow. She runs to the floor, where she has neat stacks of what used to be in her desk. She finds her test booklet and compares the two, clocking the I.S.A.T. address. 
AMY (CONT'D) Looks like somebody's in big, big trouble. 
EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY

SCOTT Alright, guys, count-off. The students begin their count-off.

GARRETT 
As the students continue counting off, we 
CUT TO: D.C. Montage: --Elizabeth and Scott walk with the kids through ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY. Elizabeth snaps her gum. --Elizabeth, Scott and the kids follow a TOUR GUIDE through the WHITE HOUSE. Elizabeth takes the gum from her mouth and looks for a place to toss it. She doesn't see a trash can and quickly sticks it to the bottom of an antique table. --Chase has Elizabeth take a "Charlie's Angels" posed picture of her and her minions. Elizabeth takes the picture before they're fully posed and hands the camera back. 
END MONTAGE. 
INT. ILLINOIS STANDARDIZED TEST OFFICES - DAY 
Amy, her face still covered in the rash, sits across from Carl Halabi, the administrator that Elizabeth roofied. Carl is staring at a photo of Elizabeth. 
CARL She changed her hair. Is Marjorie in some kind of trouble? 
AMY I think you're the one that might be in some kind of trouble! Did you or did you not give her a copy of the state test? 
CARL What?! No! 
(THEN) All I did was give her a couple of quotes ,for her article and that's it. 
AMY What article? 
CARL For the Tribune. She's a reporter there. Right? Amy's eyes go wide. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
Amy's car ZOOMS past the camera. 
INT. AMY'S CAR - DAY 
Amy's drives, her hands at 10 and 2. CLOSE ON the speedometer as the needle hovers between 55 and 56 mph. 
SCOTT Oh my gosh, I'm dry-humping the shit out of you. 
ELIZABETH Erg. Dry fuck the fuck out of me. 
SCOTT Oh my gosh, I'm so close... I'm... pfft. Ugh. Scott rolls off of Elizabeth and exhales deeply. There's a wet spot on his jeans. 
SCOTT (CONT'D) That was a mistake. 
ELIZABETH That was fast. 
SCOTT I know, I'm sorry. But this isn't me. And I. know this isn't you. I'm in love with Amy. 
ELIZABETH But we're so good together. We both hate slavery, we both love teaching. And call me crazy, but I always imagined us spending summers at your family's compound in Hyannisport. 
SCOTT I know. And you're awesome and you have a huge heart and I love your empathy. It's just, when I was dry-humping you, I couldn't stop thinking about dry-humping Any. 
ELIZABETH It's because of my tits, isn't it? Well, I'm getting new ones in, like, two days. Don't make a decision until you see them. 
SCOTT Elizabeth, I think you're beautiful just the way you are, even with your flat chest. And I think Amy's beautiful. But I just have to do what's right. I made Amy a promise. 
Scott holds up his hand, showing off a PROMISE RING. 
ELIZABETH What're you -- 13? Elizabeth angrily gets up and pulls on her socks. 
SCOTT Wait, Elizabeth. Don't go. Spend the night here with me. You can sleep on the other bed. 
ELIZABETH 
(FAKE EXCITEMENT) Ooh, like a slumber party? I'm leaving. And for the record, your band sucks, asstard. Elizabeth opens the room door and exits. She tries slamming the door, but it's on a spring so it closes very, very slowly. 
EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - DAY 
The kids listen to a TOUR GUIDE on the steps of the memorial. Garrett sneaks furtive glances at Chase. Elizabeth stands away from the group, on her cell. 
ELIZABETH 
(ON PHONE) Wally. Why would I cheat? If I'm guilty of anything, it's teaching too hard. Great... I've got nothing to hide. She ends the call. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Fuck! Scott, wearing a Thomas Jefferson souvenir T-shirt, and all of the students look over at Elizabeth. 
ELIZABETH.(CONT'D) What?! The Tour Guide looks around uncertainly before continuing. 
TOUR GUIDE And does anyone know what Abraham Lincoln's nickname was? Sasha's hand shoots up. 
SASHA Honest Abe. 
TOUR GUIDE "Honest Abe", that's right. Because Lincoln always said what was on his mind, even if that meant being unpopular. Abraham Lincoln always showed great courage. Garrett takes this in. He looks over at Chase and then, after a beat, raises his hand. 
TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D) Yes? 
GARRETT I love Chase Streeter-Rossi. All eyes turn to Garrett. Chase looks mortified. 
TOUR GUIDE Okay then. Any other questions? 
GARRETT (presses, turns to Chase) I love you, Chase. I've always loved you. And even though you pretty much stopped talking to me in fifth grade, I don't care. I remember the Chase that wrote me a card when my dad was overweight and had to go to the hospital because of his heart -- 
SASHA That was from the whole class. 
GARRETT Shut up, Sasha, I'm talking about a different card. 
(CONTINUING) And then, a year later, when he left my mom and moved in with his trainer, you wrote me another card. What happened to us? Remember when we had a sleepover in the second grade and you wet your bed and you were so embarrassed and you made me promise not to ever tell anyone. Well, I never did and I never will. I know we're really young, but remember Romeo and Juliet were only 13. A lot of people don't know that. So there it is. My heart on a sleeve. (goes into rhyming verse) Don't let me leave / Always believe / A beat. Chase stares at Garrett. 
CHASE Gross. Chase's friends all start laughing. The rest of the class joins in. Garrett runs down the steps, away from everyone. 
SCOTT Alright, guys, let's settle down. The Tour Guide looks around, uncertain. 
TOUR GUIDE 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. AMY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Amy, the phone cradled to her ear, leans back on her couch. She's wearing splotches of calamine lotion over her rash and her hair is pulled back. A TURTLE plods across her kitchen table. 
AMY 
(WHEELS SPINNING) Oh my gosh. We just might have a Mary Kay Letourneau situation on our hands. Amy scratches the turtle's neck as it continues across the table. 
SCOTT I don't know. You think? 
AMY I know. The woman's a criminal mastermind. 
SCOTT This is such a mess. 
AMY What I need from you is to focus and get our kids home safe. I'll take care of everything here. 
SCOTT Thanks, Amy. You're a lifesaver. 
AMY It's what I do. Love you, Scooter. She hangs up the phone and cockily kicks her feet onto the table, accidentally knocking the turtle to the floor. 
AMY (CONT'D) Oh boy. 
EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - NIGHT 
We're no longer in the tourist areas. A STRAY DOG walks down the middle of the street. SIRENS WAIL. PROSTITUTES hail Johns with catcalls. Elizabeth, still in her broken heels, walks down the gritty street. - 
ELIZABETH 
(CALLING) Garrett! Garrett! Her phone RINGS. She checks the CALLER ID -- "HOT SCOTT." 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) 
(ANSWERING PHONE) I'm looking for him! Stop fucking calling me! 
She powers her phone off and continues down the street. She passes two PROSTITUTES. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Hey, guys. Hi. I'm looking for a young kid, about 13. Really annoying, kind of a cry baby. Have you seen him? 
PROSTITUTE #1 Fuck you. 
ELIZABETH Fantastic. 
PROSTITUTE #2 You best step off, bitch, because this is my block. This here's Poetry's block. 
ELIZABETH Poetry? 
PROSTITUTE #1 Cause that's how she fuck. 
PROSTITUTE #2 I fuck like that. Lyrical. Something occurs to Elizabeth. She smiles. 
ELIZABETH Thank you, Poetry. And Poetry's friend. Elizabeth walks off and sticks out her hand, trying to hail a cab. She passes a bunch of HOMELESS MEN warming up by a trash can fire. 
HOMELESS MAN #1 Won't get a cab in this neighborhood. A CAR slows next to Elizabeth. A JOHN rolls down the passenger window and leans out. 
JOHN Hey, sweetheart. How much for a titty fuck? 
ELIZABETH I need a ride. 
JOHN Oh yeah, I need a ride, too. Right through those titties. 
ELIZABETH No, I need a ride. Like you driving, and me pointing mace at your face. I'll give you ten bucks. 
JOHN 
(A BEAT) This is weird. Twenty. Elizabeth hops in. 
Principal.Snur sits across from Garrett's mother, Melody, who is beside herself. She is wearing a beret. A DETECTIVE and Amy are standing behind the desk. Principal Snur passes her a dolphin-shaped tissue box. 
DETECTIVE What else can you tell us about Garrett and Ms. Halsey's relationship? 
MELODY It was strictly student/teacher. Garrett's a gifted poet and Ms. Halsey was trying to bring that out of him. Amy snorts. 
DETECTIVE Did they ever spend time outside of the classroom? 
MELODY Aside from Christmas at our house? Absolutely not. The Detective glances at the Principal, like "Oh boy." 
AMY She used to give all the guys that look. That sex look. You know -- Amy gives her version of a sexy look to the Detective. 
AMY (CONT'D) She's a monster. 
DETECTIVE Mrs. Tiara, I think we might need to consider the possibility that Elizabeth Halsey has abducted your son and that the two of them are involved in a sexual relationship. 
MELODY 
(INCONSOLABLE) Marbles doesn't even have armpit hair! 
DETECTIVE (quietly, to Principal Snur) We should send out an Amber Alert. We need to catch this Sicko. 
TV NEWS FOOTAGE A REPORTER talks to camera on the steps of J.A.M.S. Other NEWS CREWS are in the bg. 
REPORTER A school official close to the scandal confirms that in addition to her alleged sexual relationship with the unnamed seventh grader, Elizabeth Halsey has been investigated for possible drug use, standardized testing fraud, and the theft of an "Annie" wig from a school production. The TV Report flashes an unflattering photo of ELIZABETH with a BLURRED OUT GARRETT. In front of the school, the Reporter turns to Principal Snur. 
REPORTER (CONT'D) Can you comment on any of these allegations? 
PRINCIPAL SNUR The superintendent will speak to the press shortly, but for now, I'd just like to say that I hope Ms. Halsey does the right thing and brings back our student. 
INT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - TRAIN STATION - NIGHT 
Elizabeth buys two tickets. Garrett hovers beside her.

EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT 
KIRK And she has touched the lives of those around her -- until last night. Elizabeth pulls Kirk into a lawyer/client huddle. 
ELIZABETH 
(WHISPERS) You kind of sound like a pro. 
KIRK 
(WHISPERS) Do you think they're going to find out that I didn't pass the bar? 
ELIZABETH 
(WHISPERS) You're doing great. They break from their huddle. 
KIRK Your administration jumped to conclusions, set off a media fire-storm and has humiliated one of its own. As Ms. .Halsey's chief counsel, I've advised her that we have an extremely strong case of libel and that it's certainly within her province to sue the district. 
SUPERINTENDENT How do we make this go away? 
KIRK Ms. Halsey is not a litigious woman. She wants this whole matter to go away as quickly and painlessly as possible. Kirk slides a piece of paper across the desk. 
KIRK (CONT'D) This is a list of our demands. The Superintendent and Principal Snur scan the list. 
SUPERINTENDENT You're kidding me. 
ELIZABETH Don't answer right now. Let it marinate. Oh, and I should mention that if this goes to trial, I can cry on cue. Elizabeth starts crying. Everybody looks at her, aghast. And as quickly she started, she stops. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Now, if you'll all excuse me, I should be heading to fifth period. I hate to be tardy. 
INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY 
Elizabeth heads down the empty hallway. From the auditorium, the faint sound of "Tomorrow, Tomorrow" from "Annie" can be heard. Amy steps out of the auditorium, humming along to the song. She notices Elizabeth coming to her. Amy debates her options. 
AMY Elizabeth! I was so worried. You gave us quite a scare, you did. Elizabeth doesn't acknowledge her and continues walking toward Amy, only feet away now. 
AMY (CONT'D) (attempting some levity) Somebody's being a grumple-- BAM! Elizabeth punches Amy square in the nose. Amy drops to her knees and grabs her nose, now squirting blood. 
AMY (CONT'D) Elizabeth keeps walking and turns a corner. A BELL RINGS and the hallway starts filling with STUDENTS. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.) Well, it's been another great year at 
JAMS... 
INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - GYM - DAY 
QUICK CUTS. The year is winding down. Instead of gym, kids are using the time to sign each other's yearbooks. Chase walks up to Garrett with her yearbook, asks him to sign it. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.) Who can forget the exciting addition of a climbing wall to the small gym... 
INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY 
QUICK CUTS. It's class photo day. With each FLASH, we SEE a different TEACHER with a different CLASS. And finally AMY, with a bandage over her nose and two black eyes, smiles widely alongside her CLASS. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.) .Or the student/teacher spelling bee. 
INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY 
Much like the first scene of the movie. The teachers are sipping plastic flutes of Champagne. Principal Snur is up front. Elizabeth lingers in the back. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR I think that was a huge s-u-c-c-a-s-s. Polite laughter. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D) But seriously... With summer around the corner, it's time to not only say goodbye to another school year, but to also say goodbye to one of our own. Elizabeth smiles. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D) Amy Squirrel. Amy, her face completely healed, steps forward, with a pursed smile. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D) After six short years of outstanding, tireless work here, Amy is transferring out of the district.

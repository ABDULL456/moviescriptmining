Trainspotting 
Screenplay by 
John Hodge 
Based on the Novel by 
Irvine Welsh 
Directed by 
Danny Boyle 
EXT. STREET. DAY 
Legs run along the pavement. They are Mark Renton's. 
Just ahead of him is Spud. They are both belting along. 
As they travel, various objects (pens, tapes, CDs, toiletries, ties, sunglasses, etc.) either fall or are discarded from inside their jackets. 
They are pursued by two hard-looking Store Detectives in identical uniforms. The men are fast, but Renton and Spud maintain their lead. 
RENTON (voice-over) 
Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family, Choose a fucking big television, Choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players, and electrical tin openers. 
Suddenly, as Renton crosses a road, a car skids to a halt, inches from him. 
In a moment of detachment he stops and looks at the shocked driver, then at Spud, who has continued running, then at the Two Men, who are now closing in on him. 
He smiles. 
INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT ROOM. DAY 
In a bare, dingy room, Renton lies on the floor, alone, motionless and drugged. 
RENTON (v.o) 
Choose good health, low cholesterol and dental insurance. Choose fixed-interest mortgage repayments. Choose a starter home. Choose your friends. 
EXT. FOOTBALL PITCH. NIGHT 
On a flood lit five-a-side pitch, Renton and his friends are taking on another team at football. 
The opposition all wear an identical strip (Arsenal), whereas Renton and his friends wear an odd assortment of gear. 
Three girls -- Lizzy, Gail, and Allison and Baby -- stand by the side, watching. 
The boys are outclassed by the team with the strip but play much dirtier. 
As each performs a characteristic bit of play, the play freezes and their name is visible, printed or written on some item of clothing. (T-Shirt, baseball cap, shorts, trainers). In Begbie's case, his name appears as a tatoo on his arm. 
Sick Boy commits a sneaky foul and indignantly denies it. 
Begbie commits an obvious foul and make no effort to deny it. 
Spud, in goal, lets the ball in between his legs. 
Tommy kicks the ball as hard as he can. 
Renton's litany continues over the action: 
RENTON (v.o) 
Choose leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose a three piece suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY and wondering who you are on a Sunday morning. Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing sprit-crushing game shows, stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pishing you last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked-up brats you have spawned to replace yourself. Choose your future. Choose life. 
Renton is hit straight in the face by the ball. He lies back on the astroturf. Voice-over continues. 
But who would I want to do a thing like that? 
INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY 
Renton lies on the floor. 
Swanney, Allison and Baby, Sick Boy and Spud are shooting up or preparing to shoot up. Sick Boy is talking to Allison as he taps up a vein on her arm. 
RENTON (v.o) 
SWANNEY 
Sure, sure. I've heard it before. 
RENTON 
The Sick Boy method. 
They both look at Sick Boy 
SWANNEY 
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him. 
RENTON 
He's always been lacking in moral fibre. 
SWANNEY 
He knows a lot about Sean Connery. 
RENTON 
That's hardly a substitute. 
SWANNEY 
you'll need one more hit. 
RENTON 
No, I don't think so. 
SWANNEY 
To see you through the night that lies ahead. 
Freeze Frame on Swanney. 
RENTON (v.o) 
We called him the mother superior on account of the length of his habit. He knew all about it. On it, off it, he knew it all. Of course I'd have another shot: after all, I had work to do. 
INT. RENTON'S FLAT ROOM. DAY 
The door opens and Renton enters carrying shopping bags. He empties them on to a mattress beside three buckets and a television. 
RENTON (v.o) 
Relinquishing junk. Stage One: preparation. For this you will need: one room which you will not leave; one mattress; tomato soup, ten tins of; mushroom soup, eight tins of, for consumption cold; ice cream, vanilla, one large tub of; Magnesia, Milk of, one bottle; paracetamol; mouth wash; vitamins; mineral water; Lucozade; pornography; one bucket for urine, one for feces, and one for vomitus; one television; and one bottle of Valium, which I have already procured, from my mother, who is, in her own domestic and socially acceptable way, also a drug addict. 
Renton swallows several Valium tablets. Voice-over continues. 
And now I'm ready. All I need is a final hit to soothe the pain while the Valium takes effect. 
INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY 
Swanney, Sick Boy, Spud and Allison and Baby all lie inert while the telephone rings. 
INT. CALL BOX. DAY 
Renton curses as he slams down the receiver. He dials again. 
RENTON 
Mikey. It's Mark Renton. Can you help me out? 
INT. MIKEY'S FLAT. DAY 
Renton holds two opium suppositories in the palm of his hand. 
RENTON (v.o) 
This was typical of Mikey Forrester. 
(on screen) 
What the fuck are these? 
His head is over the bowl now. Gradually he reaches still further until his head is lowered into the bowl, followed by his neck, torso, other arm, and finally his legs, all disappearing. 
The cubicle is empty. 
INT. UNDER WATER. DAY 
Renton, dressed as before, swims through murky depths until he reaches the bottom, where he picks up the suppositories, which glow like luminous pearls, before heading up towards the surface again. 
INT. HORRIBLE TOILET CUBICLE. DAY 
The toilet is empty. 
Suddenly Renton appears through the bowl, then his arms as he lifts himself out. Still clasping his two suppositories, he walks out of the toilet. 
INT. RENTON'S ROOM. DAY 
The mattress, buckets and supplies are laid out as before. 
The door opens and Renton enters, still soaking and dripping. 
The suppositories are in his hand. He holds them up, and they twinkle in the light. 
RENTON 
Now. Now I'm ready. 
INT. RENTON'S ROOM. DAY 
The cans of soup, the bottle of water, and the carton of ice cream are empty, the bottle of pills spilt, the magazines well thumbed. 
SICK BOY 
You Only Live Twice? 
RENTON 
Nineteen-sixty-seven. 
SICK BOY 
Running time? 
RENTON 
One hundred and sixteen minutes. 
SICK BOY 
Director? 
RENTON 
Lewis Gilbert. 
SICK BOY 
Screenwriter? 
RENTON 
Eh - Ian Fleming? 
SICK BOY 
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them. 
RENTON 
OK, so who was it, then? 
SICK BOY 
You can look it up. 
Sick Boy throws across a worn copy of a film guide. 
Renton cannot be bothered to pick it up. 
How are you feeling since you came off the skag? For myself, I'm bored. 
RENTON 
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make? 
EXT. PARK. DAY 
Sick Boy rests the gun down. 
SICK BOY 
All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory. 
RENTON 
What about The Untouchables? 
SICK BOY 
I don't rate that at all. 
RENTON 
Despite the Academy award? 
SICK BOY 
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote. 
RENTON Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it? SICK BOY 
Yeah. 
RENTON 
That's your theory? 
SICK BOY 
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated. 
RENTON 
Give me the gun. 
EXT. PARK. DAY Through the sight again. This time a Skinhead and his muscle-bound dog are in view. 
Sick Boy and Renton talk like Sean Connery. 
SICK BOY 
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights? 
RENTON 
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem. 
The gun fires and the dog yelps, jumps up and bites its owner (the Skinhead). 
SICK BOY 
For a vegetarian, Rents, you're a fucking evil shot. 
EXT. PARK. DAY 
Renton loads up again. 
RENTON (v.o) 
Without heroin, I attempted to lead a useful and fulfilling life as a good citizen. 
INT. CAFÃ‰. DAY 
Two milkshakes clink together. 
Renton and Spud and seated at a booth, dressed in their own fashion for job interviews. 
RENTON 
Good luck, Spud. 
MAN 1 
Do you recall the school motto? 
RENTON 
Of course, the motto, the motto -- 
MAN 1 
Strive, hope, believe and conquer. 
RENTON 
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world. 
Renton looks pious under scrutiny. 
MAN 2 
Mr. Renton -- 
RENTON 
Yes. 
MAN 2 
You seem eminently suited to this post but I wonder if you could explain the gaps in your employment record? 
RENTON 
Yes, I can. The truth -- well, the truth is that I've had a long-standing problem with heroin addiction. I've been know to sniff it, smoke it, swallow it, stick it up my arse and inject it into my veins. I've been trying to combat this addiction, but unless you count social security scams and shoplifting, I haven't had a regular job in years. I feel it's important to mention this. 
There is silence. 
A paper clip crashes to the floor. 
INT. OFFICE. DAY 
The same office. The same team are interviewing Spud. 
SPUD 
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am. 
MAN 1 
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application? 
SPUD 
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right? 
MAN 1 
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it. 
SPUD 
Hey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man. You're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. I'm merely here. But obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it? 
MAN 2 
Mr. Murphy, what attracts you to the leisure industry? 
SPUD 
In a word, pleasure. My pleasure in other people's leisure. 
WOMAN 
What do you see as your main strengths? 
SPUD 
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars. 
WOMAN 
Begbie, his story complete, finishes his pint. The others continue to stare at him, frozen as though expecting something more. Begbie smiles and throws the pint over his head. 
Freeze-frame: the glass in mid-air and Begbie's smiling face. 
RENTON (v.o) 
And that was it. That was Begbie's story. Or at least that was Begbie's version of the story. But a couple of days later I got the truth from Tommy. It was one of his major weaknesses: he never told lies, never took drugs, and never cheated on anyone. 
INT. TOMMY'S FLAT. DAY 
Renton's hand flicks through a long row of videos on the floor while the sound of weights being lifted (by Tommy) emanates from nearby. 
Most of the videos are feature films or comedy shows, some with titles written in Tommy's hand, but two catch Renton's attention. 
They are 100 Great Goals and Tommy and Lizzy Vol. 1, the latter a handwritten title. 
Renton looks from the video round to Tommy, who is engrossed in lifting weights. 
TOMMY 
Well, sure it was Wednesday morning, we were in the Volley playing pool, that much is true. 
INT. POOL HALL. DAY 
Tommy's account over a depiction of his version. 
TOMMY (v.o) 
But Begbie is playing absolutely fucking gash. He's got a hangover so bad he can hardly hold the fucking cue, never mind pot the ball. I'm doing my best to lose, trying to humour him, like, but it's not doing any good: every time I touch the ball I pot something, every time Begbie goes near the table he fucks it up. So he's got the hump, right, but finally I manage to set it up so all he's go to do is pot the black to win one game and salvage a little pride and maybe not kick my head in, right. So he's on the black, pressure shot, and it all goes wrong, big time. What does he do? Picks on this specky wee gadge at the bar and accuses him of putting him off by looking at him. Can you believe it? I mean, the poor cunt hasn't even glanced in our direction. He's sitting there quiet as a mouse when Beggars gubs him with the cue. He was going to chib him, I tell you, then I thought he was going to do me. The Beggar is fucking psycho, but he's a mate, you know, so what can you do? 
The events are as follows: 
Begbie and Tommy are playing pool. 
Begbie, furious, miscues, goes in off, etc. 
Tommy deliberately misses sitters and tries to look annoyed. 
Begbie lines up to play the black. It is unmissable. 
At the bar beyond sits a harmless young Man, wearing the same clothes as the Hard Man in Begbie's account except that they are now baggy rather than taut. He is clearly not staring at Begbie but drinks a half-pint and eats some crisps. 
As Begbie plays, the Man bites a crisp. 
Begbie miscues, rips the cloth and the ball flies off the table. 
Tommy catches it and looks up to see Begbie assaulting the young Man. 
Tommy cautiously restrains Begbie and he reaches into his jacket for a knife. 
Begbie turns and for a moment looks as though he might attack Tommy. 
INT. TOMMY'S FLAT. DAY 
Tommy puts down his weights. 
Renton holds up 100 Great Goals. 
RENTON 
Can I borrow this one? 
INT. PUB 2. NIGHT 
The freeze-frame of the glass in mid-air and Begbie's smiling face. 
RENTON (v.o) 
Yeah, the guy's a psycho, but it's true, he's a mate as well, so what can you do? Just stand back and watch and try not to get involved. Begbie didn't do drugs either, he just did people. That what he got off on: his own sensory addiction. 
The glass falls into the crowd. 
Screaming starts. A Woman is bleeding from a wound in her head. The Men beside her turn furiously around to look for the source of the glass. 
Up on the balcony, Begbie stands up. The screams and shouting continue below. 
Begbie appears at the bottom of the staircase down from the balcony. 
He strides towards the bleeding Woman and begins shouting. 
I read it in Cosmopolitan. 
LIZZY 
It's an interesting theory. 
GAIL 
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy. 
LIZZY 
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday? 
GAIL 
What happened? 
LIZZY 
He forgot. Useless motherfucker. 
INT. NIGHTCLUB. DANCE AREA. NIGHT 
Tommy and Spud seated as before. Their words are subtitled. 
As they are speaking Gail and Lizzy return and sit down. 
TOMMY 
Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us. 
SPUD 
That's fair enough. 
TOMMY 
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night. 
SPUD 
Went ballistic? 
TOMMY 
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.' 
SPUD 
So what's it going to be? 
TOMMY 
Well, I've paid for the ticket. 
GAIL AND LIZZY 
What are you two talking about? 
TOMMY AND SPUID 
Football. What were you talking about? 
GAIL and LIZZY 
Shopping 
Standing nearby but apart from them is Renton. 
Renton notes Spud and Tommy with their partners, and across the other side Sick Boy and Begbie are engaged in flirtatious conversation with Two Women. 
RENTON (v.o) 
The situation was becoming serious. Young Renton noticed the haste with which the successful, in the sexual sphere as in all others, egregated themselves from the failures. 
Begbie and Sick Boy with the Two Women. 
Renton standing among a group of lone nerds. 
I think I left something back at the - 
The girl has disappeared into the back of the taxi. 
Renton looks around. 
TAXI DRIVER 
Are you getting in or not, pal? 
EXT. ROAD. NIGHT 
The taxi motors along. 
INT. TAXI. NIGHT 
Renton and Diane are kissing passionately in the back. 
EXT. STREET. NIGHT 
Spud is pushed against the wall held by his lapels. He drinks from a bottle of beer in one hand. 
GAIL 
Do you understand? 
Spud nods drunkenly. 
Gail releases her grip. 
Our relationship is not being redefined; it is developing in an appropriate, organic fashion. I expect you to be a considerate and thoughtful lover, generous but firm. Failure on your part to live up to these very reasonable expectations will result in swift resumption of a non-sex situation. Right? 
Spud drinks from a bottle in the other hand and says nothing but he does not look too happy. 
INT. TOMMY'S FLAT. NIGHT 
Tommy and Lizzy kiss while Tommy unlocks the door. 
INT. DIANE'S HOME, HALLWAY. NIGHT 
In a darkened suburban hallway, the door opens and two figures enter. 
RENTON 
Diane. 
DIANE 
Ssshh! 
RENTON 
Sorry. 
DIANE 
Shut up. 
They walk through another door and close it behind them. 
INT. TOMMY'S FLAT. NIGHT 
Tommy and Lizzy kiss against the inside of th door, taking their outer clothes off. 
INT. DIANE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 
By a pale bedside light, Diane and Renton undress. 
INT. GAIL'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 
Spud is lying unconscious on the bed. Gail stands over him. 
GAIL 
Wake up, Spud, wake up. Sex. 
She kicks him. He moans. 
Casual sex. 
DIANE 
And don't make any noise. 
INT. TOMMY'S FLAT. NIGHT 
The lights are full on now. Lizzy sits on the bed clutching a blanket around herself. 
Tommy hops around in his underwear, searching desperately. 
All the videos are opened and scattered everywhere. LIZZY 
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy? 
TOMMY 
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake. 
LIZZY 
Returned it? Where? To the video shop, Tommy? To the fucking video store? So every punter in Edinburgh is jerking off to our video? God, Tommy, I feel sick. 
INT. DIANE'S HOME, LIVING-ROOM. MORNING 
Renton lies submerged under a blanket. 
The sounds of a normal morning travel from a room nearby: whistles, radio, voices. 
Renton peeps over the edge of the blanket, then covers his head again. 
INT. GAIL'S BEDROOM. MORNING 
Spud opens his eyes. With his fingers, he feels crusted liquid around his mouth. 
Abruptly he turns around: the bed is soaked in vomit. 
He looks under the cover and drops it again in revulsion. 
INT. DIANE'S HOME, LIVING-ROOM. DAY 
Renton pulls himself up off the sofa and dresses as quickly as possible. 
INT. GAIL'S BEDROOM. DAY 
Spud wipes the vomit from his chest with a pillowcase, which he dumps in the middle of the sheets before gathering the whole lot up as a bundle. 
INT. DIANE'S HOME, HALL/KITCHEN. DAY 
The door swings open. A Man and a Woman, about Renton's age, sit at the kitchen table. They look up to see Renton in the doorway. MAN 
Good Morning. 
WOMAN 
Come in and sit down. You must be Mark. 
Renton walks to the table and sits down. RENTON 
Yes, that's me. 
WOMAN 
You're a friend of Diane's? 
RENTON 
More of a friend of a friend, really. 
MAN 
Right. 
RENTON 
Are you her flatmates? 
The couple exchange a look and laugh. WOMAN 
Flatmates. I must remember that one. 
SPUD I guess this means I'll never get to have sex with Gail. 
INT. TOMMY'S FLAT. DAY 
Tommy sits alone, watching 
100 Great Goals 
EXT. STREET. DAY 
Renton paces briskly down the street, followed by Diane. DIANE I don't see why not. 
RENTON 
Because it's illegal. 
DIANE 
Holding hands? 
RENTON 
No, not holding hands. 
DIANE 
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night. 
RENTON 
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet. 
They stop at the school gates. DIANE 
Calm down. You're not going to jail. 
RENTON 
Easy for you to say. 
DIANE 
Can I see you again? 
RENTON 
Certainly not. 
Renton walks away. DIANE 
If you don't see me again I'll tell the police. 
Renton turns and walks back to her. They stand for a moment, then Renton walks away again. Diane smiles. (to herself) 
I'll see you around then. 
EXT. VIDEO STORE. DAY 
In the cold light of morning, Tommy and Lizzy wait, not speaking, outside the still-closed video store. 
EXT. RAIL BRIDGE. DAY 
A train speeds across. 
INT. TRAIN. DAY 
Sick Boy, Tommy, Spud and Renton sit drinking from an extensive carry-out. SICK BOY 
This had better be good. 
TOMMY 
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack. 
SICK BOY 
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing. 
TOMMY 
It looks easy, this, but it's not. It looks like a doss, like a soft option, but living like this, it's a full-time business. 
He injects. 
INT. SHOP. DAY 
Renton, Spud, and Sick Boy are stuffing objects into their shirts and pockets. 
INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY 
Renton lies back, narcotized. 
EXT. STREET. DAY 
Renton and Spud are running along the street. Two uniformed Store Detectives are running after them. Sick Boy stands in a doorway. As the Detectives run past, he strolls away in the opposite direction. 
INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY 
Renton lies back as before. SICK BOY 
Ursula Andress was the quintessential Bond girl. That's what everyone says. The embodiment of his superiority to us: beautiful, exotic, highly sexual and yet unavailable to everyone but him. Shite. Let's face it: if she'd shag one punter from Edinburgh, she'd shag the fucking lot of us. 
INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. LATER 
Spud cooks up, watched by Swanney. Nearby lie the drugged forms of Renton, Sick Boy and Allison and Baby. 
INT. RENTON FAMILY HOME, LIVING-ROOM. NIGHT 
Renton's Mother and Father sit reading the paper and a magazine. 
INT. RENTON FAMILY HOME, PARENTS' BEDROOM. NIGHT 
Renton trawls through drawers and any containers (shoe boxes, make-up boxes, under the mattress, etc.) until he finds some cash/jewelry. 
INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY 
Renton lies back, staring vacantly ahead. Tommy flops down beside him. Renton shows barely a flicker of awareness. TOMMY 
Lizzy's gone, Mark, she's gone and fucking dumped me. It was the video tape and that Iggy Pop business and all sorts of other stuff. She told me where to go and no mistake. I said, is there any chance of getting back together, like, but no way, no fucking way. 
INT. HOSPITAL WARD SITTING-ROOM. DAY 
A few elderly patients sit in armchairs watching daytime television. Renton and Spud jump and climb through an open window. Watched by the helpless patients, they calmly disconnect the television and take it with them as they leave by the same route. 
INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY 
Renton and Tommy slumped side by side as before. TOMMY 
I want to try it, Mark. You're always going on about how it's the ultimate hit and that. Better than sex. Come on, I'm a fucking adult. I want to find out for myself. 
Renton huddles up and leans away from Tommy. I've got the money. Tommy produces ten pounds from his pocket. 
EXT. STREET. DAY 
Renton and Spud run along the street. 
INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY 
Tommy lies drugged on the floor. 
INT. FLAT TO BE BURGLED. DAY 
The door of an ordinary flat is kicked open. Begbie walks in, crowbar in hand, followed by Sick Boy and Spud. 
INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY 
SICK BOY 
Honor Blackman a.k.a. Pussy Galore, what a total fucking misnomer. I wouldn't touch her with yours. I'd sooner shag Col Kreb. At least you know where you are with a woman like that. Not much to look at, like, but personality, that's what counts, that's what keeps a relationship going through the years. Like heroin. I mean, heroin's got fucking great personality. 
Sick Boy opens the heel of a his shoe to reveal a syringe. 
INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY 
Swanney hands over a small bag of heroin in exchange for ten pounds from Renton. 
INT. FLAT TO BE BURGLED, KITCHEN. DAY 
Spud checks the fridge and pulls out a large chunk of deep-frozen meat. He hits with the crowbar until it fractures and splits. Inside there is some jewellery. 
He hands Renton the syringe. Renton inject, then lies back on the dirty, red, carpeted floor. He lies completely still. His pupils shrink. His breathing becomes slow, shallow and intermittent. He sinks into the floor until he is lying in a coffin-shaped and coffin-sized pit, lined by the red carpet. Swanney stands over him. SWANNEY 
Perhaps sir would like me to call for a taxi? 
An ambulance siren becomes faintly audible. 
INT. SWANNEY'S STAIRWELL. NIGHT 
The siren is a little louder. Swanney holds Renton under his arms and drags him backwards down the steps. 
EXT. STREET. NIGHT 
As Swanney emerges, still dragging Renton, the siren grows louder and then an ambulance speeds by without stopping. Swanney drags Renton across the pavement and into the open door of a waiting taxi. Swanney then steps out of the taxi's other door, pausing only to tuck a ten-pound note into Renton's pocket before closing the door. 
INT. TAXI. NIGHT 
Renton lies on the floor of the taxi, as Swanney left him, rolling slightly as the taxi takes a corner. 
EXT. HOSPITAL/TAXI. NIGHT 
The taxi is stationary. We do not see the driver's face but his hand opens the door and then drags Renton out on to the pavement by his ankles before taking the ten pound note, getting back in the cab and driving away. Renton lies on the pavement. Two Porters life him by arms and ankles on to a trolley. We do not see the Porters's faces as they wheel Renton into the hospital. 
INT. HOSPITAL ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. NIGHT 
Renton is wheeled through the department, then into a bay surrounded by a white nylon curtain. 
INT. TROLLEY BAY. NIGHT 
The Porters lift Renton from one trolley on to another, then leave him alone in the bay surrounded by the curtain. Renton lies alone. His breathing is still shallow and erratic. Around him is the usual accident and emergency paraphernalia: blood pressure machine, oxygen tap, bandages, etc. A Doctor comes in and gives Renton an injection, then leaves. DOCTOR 
Wake up. Wake up. 
Renton breathes more easily. 
The Two Porters return with another trolley. They lift Renton roughly on to it and wheel him away. 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. NIGHT 
The Porters wheel Renton along. 
INT. WARD. NIGHT 
The Porters lift Renton off the trolley and dump him on the bed. A nurse sticks a thermometer in his mouth. 
INT. WARD. DAY 
Renton's Father and Mother lift Renton, now fully conscious, off the bed and dump him in a wheelchair. 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. DAY 
Mother walks ahead. Behind her, Father pushes Renton in the wheelchair. 
INT. TAXI. DAY 
Mother and Father sit on either side of Renton. 
INT. RENTON'S BEDROOM. DAY 
Father shoves Renton on to the bed, then walks out past Mother, who looks at Renton for a moment before closing the door. 
INT. OTHER SIDE OF RENTON'S BEDROOM DOOR. DAY 
Renton's Father's hand slides three bolts across to lock the door. 
INT. RENTON'S BEDROOM. DAY 
Renton lies on the bed. RENTON (v.o) 
I don't feel the sickness yet, but it's in the post, that's for sure. I'm in the junky limbo at the moment, too ill to sleep, too tired to stay awake, but the sickness is on its way. Sweat, chills, nausea, pain and craving. Need like nothing else I have ever known will soon take hold of me. It's on the way. 
The door opens. Renton's Mother walks in with a bowl of soup and a piece of bread. Father watches from the doorway. MOTHER 
We'll help you, son. You'll stay with us until you get better. We'll beat this together. 
RENTON 
Maybe I could go back to the clinic. 
MOTHER 
Fanfare. 
And now, question number three: is he guilty or not guilty? 
MOTHER 
He's our son. 
DOCTOR 
Is the correct answer. 
Fanfare. 
And now it's time to 'Take the Test'. 
Lights flash. Music. A garish Hostess walks on with two envelopes. She holds them out for Mother to choose one. 
INT. CONSULTING ROOM. DAY 
The Doctor watches in silence as the Hostess, now dressed as a medical technician, draws blood from Renton's arm and puts it into a tube. She marks the tube with a pre-printed, numbered label. 
INT. STUDIO. DAY 
Mother opens one of the envelopes. She is speechless with joy. The plastic booth opens up. Lights flash again, etc. Renton steps out. 
INT. SOCIAL CLUB. NIGHT 
Renton, his Mother and Father sit at a table in the local social club. It is a Saturday night and the club is busy. Everyone sits in rapt silence. It is not initially clear what is going on. Near the bar a Caller with a microphone calls over the PA - Two and four, twenty-four...seven...fifteen...clickety-click, sixty-six - And so on, as he draws the numbers from the drum. Everyone studies their cards, except Renton, who studies the people instead, his drink untouched. The number-calling continues until suddenly interrupted by Mother's voice. MOTHER Mark...Mark, you've got a house. House! House! For goodness's sake, Mark. They bustle around him and pass his card to the front. RENTON (v.o) 
It seems, however, that I really am the luckiest guy in the world. Several years of addiction right in the middle of an epidemic, surrounded by the living dead, but not me -- I'm negative. It's official. And once the pain goes away, that's when the real battle starts. Depression. Boredom. You feel so fucking low, you'll want to fucking top yourself. 
His mother counts a wad of money in front of him. 
EXT. HOUSING ESTATE. DAY 
On the door of a flat 'plaguer', 'HIV', and 'junky AIDS scum' are daubed on the walls. The sound of a ball being regularly bounced against a wall can be heard. 
INT. TOMMY'S FLAT. NIGHT 
It is poorly furnished. Tommy is seated. Renton has the football, which he kicks against the wall and catches, then drops and kicks again, and so on. The ball is slightly flat. RENTON 
Are you getting out much? 
TOMMY 
No. 
RENTON 
Following the game at all? 
TOMMY 
No. 
RENTON 
No. Me Neither. 
Renton drops the ball. It rolls to a halt in the corner. He sits down. TOMMY 
You take the test? 
RENTON 
Aye. 
TOMMY 
Clear? 
RENTON 
Aye. 
TOMMY 
That's nice. 
RENTON 
When are you going to visit him? 
SICK BOY 
Don't know. Maybe Thursday. 
RENTON 
You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet? 
Sick Boy is silent. He stiffens as he avoids Renton's gaze. They shift fractionally apart. RENTON tuts. SICK BOY 
Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse. 
RENTON 
You're all hear. 
SICK BOY 
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.' Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think? 
RENTON 
Fuck you. 
SICK BOY 
And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm getting on with life. What are you doing? 
INT. RENTON'S BEDSIT. NIGHT 
Renton sits alone on the bed, making a joint and reading a book. There is a knock at the door. Renton answers the door. RENTON 
What do you want? 
DIANE 
Are you clean? 
RENTON 
Yes. 
DIANE 
Is that a promise, then? 
RENTON 
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is. 
DIANE 
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell? 
RENTON 
No. 
DIANE 
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is. 
RENTON 
Well, it isn't. 
DIANE 
Smells like it. 
RENTON 
You're too young. 
DIANE 
as he is wanted by the police in connection with an armed robbery in a jeweller's in Corstorphine. Take care. Yours with love, Diane. 
There is a buzz at the door. Renton re-examines the letter. There is another buzz. RENTON 
Oh no. 
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BEDSIT. NIGHT 
Renton opens the door to an unseen figure. It is Begbie. 
INT. BEDSIT. NIGHT 
Renton sits on the bed. Begbie stands over him, pointing a gun at his head. He pulls the trigger. It clicks harmlessly. BEGBIE 
Armed robbery? With a replica? How can it be armed robbery? It's a fucking scandal. 
He 'fires' the gun a few more times at his own head, then chucks it to the floor. 
And the haul. Look. 
He digs a few rings out of his pocket and throws them to Renton. 
Solid silver, my arse. I took it to a fence -- it's trash, pure trash. There's young couples investing all their hopes in that stuff, and what are they getting? 
RENTON 
It's a scandal, Franco. 
BEGBIE 
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way. 
INT. BEDSIT. DAY 
Begbie is sitting on the bed in his underwear, eating cereal while watching television. A small carry-out is nearby. Renton finishes dressing for work. He pauses at the open door, looking back towards his guest. RENTON (v.o) 
Begbie settled in in no time at all. 
Begbie opens a can of beer. Renton closes the door. 
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BEDSIT. DAY 
Renton closes his door. He is about to walk away when he heard Begbie shouting. BEGBIE (from the bedsit) 
Rents, Rents, come fucking back here. 
Renton opens the door. Begbie is holding out an empty packet of cigarettes. 
Look. 
RENTON 
What? 
BEGBIE 
I've no fucking cigarettes. 
Begbie throws the packet down to the floor. It lands near the door. He has turned back to the television and takes a swig of beer. RENTON 
Right. 
Renton closes the door again. 
INT. BEDSIT. NIGHT 
Renton and Begbie lie in the single bed with their heads at opposite ends. Begbie snores. Renton is wide awake, with a pair of smelly- socked feet only inches from his nose. RENTON (v.o) 
Yeah, the guy's a psycho, but it's true, he's a mate as well, so what can you do? 
INT. LONDON BEDSIT. DAY 
Where the first empty packet of cigarettes fell to the floor there is now a large heap of empty packets: the product of weeks at sixty a day. Another one lands on the pile. Begbie, still in his underwear, still can in hand, sits watchig the racing as before. Behind his, cigarettes and alcohol are stacked up like a miniature duty-free warehouse. Renton sits behind him, reading a book. BEGBIE 
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on. 
RENTON 
Can you not go yourself. 
How much? 
SICK BOY 
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ----------} 
RENTON 
So? 
SICK BOY 
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London. 
RENTON 
So we've just come from Tommy's funeral and you're telling me about a skag deal? 
BEGBIE 
Yeah. 
There is silence. RENTON 
What was your price? 
SICK BOY 
Four Grand. 
RENTON 
But you don't have the money? 
SICK BOY 
We're two thousand short. 
RENTON 
That's tough. 
SICK BOY 
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London. 
RENTON 
Sorry, boys, I don't have two thousand pounds. 
BEGBIE 
Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement. 
RENTON 
Jesus. 
BEGBIE 
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty-three pounds. 
RENTON 
Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again? 
SPUD 
I want the money, Mark, that's all. 
BEGBIE 
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail. 
EXT. STREET. DAY 
Renton is visible first, apparently talking to himself, then Diane. RENTON 
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six. 
SPUD 
I got the last one. 
RENTON 
It's your round Franco. 
Begbie stands up. BEGBIE 
OK. Same again? 
SICK BOY 
I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK? 
RENTON 
The moment you turn your back, we're out that door. 
Sick Boy walks away towards the toilet. SICK BOY 
I'll be right after you. 
BEGBIE 
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back -- 
RENTON 
We'll be half-way down the road with the money. 
BEGBIE 
I'd fucking kill you. 
RENTON 
I guess you would, Franco. 
Begbie walks away to the bar. Spud and Renton look at each other and the bag of money. 
Are you game for it? 
Spud looks at the bag and around the pub towards the toilet door and Begbie. Begbie stands at the bar, awaiting the pints. 
Well? 
SPUD 
Are you serious? 
Renton looks around. RENTON 
I don't know. What do you think? 
Spud says nothing. Suddenly they are interrupted. SICK BOY 
Still here, I see. 
Sick Boy sits down. RENTON 
Why not? I know I would. Where's Franco? 
Renton turns to see Begbie making his way through the crowd with the pints helf precariously. As he reaches the table a Man standing with a group of friends accidentally nudges Begbie, causing a pint to spill over him. BEGBIE 
For fuck's sake. 
MAN 
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another. 
BEGBIE 
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot. 
MAN 
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

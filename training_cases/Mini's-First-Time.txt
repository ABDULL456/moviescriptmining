MINI'S FIRST TIME 
Written by 
Nick Guthe 
CLOSE ON: 
The face of MINERVA "MINI" DROGUES, 18, watching something. She looks extremely bored by the television images flickering across her eyes. She has a pretty face: Large eyes, and pouty mouth. Her knowing look is incongruous with a face clearly still that of a girl. 
-                    MINI (V.O.) I know what you're thinking. Don't bullshit me, because I do... You're -         thinking, oh dear lord in heaven, please, I'm begging you. I'll gouge -         out my eyes with the straw in my drink right now. I'll jam every last kernel of popcorn into my -         mouth until I suffocate, just not another fucking teenage coming-of- age story. 
We pull back to reveal her body, which is moving out of that awkward stage between adolescence and womanhood. Though tall and thin, her hips haven't quite rounded. She's wearing a "FUCT" T-shirt and jean shorts. 
MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D) Well, relax...no prom night highjinks, no nerds becoming popular and no Shakespeare set in high school...I promise. 
CLOSE ON: THE TV SCREEN. "When Animals Attack" is on. In a series of quick cuts: 
A zoo keeper is mauled by an elephant. 
A sport fisherman is attacked on the deck of a boat by a shark he and his buddies thought was dead. 
A pit bull clamps down on his owner's arm. 
An alligator hunter stupidly puts his head in the mouth of a just-captured alligator, only to have it chomp down on his skull. 
MINI (V.O.) Since it happened, everyone's asked me how it all started. 
Mini's face registers no reaction to the gruesome images. We now see she is sitting in the living room of a well-appointed Studio City hillside home. 
INT. THE LIVING ROOM- EVENING- A PARTY. 
TEENAGERS OF PRIVILEGE and their UPTIGHT PARENTS are milling around, dancing and chatting as A DEEJAY spins tunes. 
MINI (V.O.) I suppose the obvious answer is my eighteenth birthday... 
Mini dances with a few friends in a very short mini-skirt and halter top. She clearly understands how to the drive the boys crazy and this is not lost on her mother, DIANE, 42, who stands off to the side, nursing a drink with some other HYPER- AEROBICIZED MOTHERS. 
MINI (V.O.) See, I was blessed with a terrific mom. Not only is she a lush, but she also hates me. 
Diane is beautiful, but there is an essential hardness to her that comes from a life spent trading on her looks. The blouse and mini-skirt she wears are inappropriately revealing for the occasion of her daughter's birthday. 
MINI (V.O.) A few days before the party, I overhear her on the phone ordering me a male stripper. Nothing says "I love you" like ten inches of man meat in your face. 
Diane and the other mothers are talking about Mini's dancing. 
MINI (V.O.) And knowing dear old ma, she'll try and nail him after the party...in my bed. 
Mini's friend KAYLA, a little rounder, but also brash, comes dancing over. She's swaying her hips provocatively at Mini, almost challenging her. 
MIKE RUDELL, a tanned and trim man of 55, watches their display, clearly enjoying the way it's jump-starting his imagination. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MINI (V.O.) That guy? Our neighbor Mike Rudell, big shot TV producer and the guy my mom screws whenever the batteries run out. 
Kayla and Mini begin dancing together in a very explicit way, clearly trying to make the adults uncomfortable. 
MINI Yo, bee-ach! 
KAYLA Yo, birthday bee-ach! 
MINI Is it on? 
KAYLA Oh, it's on! 
MINI That's my girl! 
Mini grabs Kayla and dips her low. 
INT. THE KITCHEN - LATER. 
Kayla instructs some CATERERS to start wheeling a giant birthday cake into the living room. The caterers look confused, but Kayla is insistent and the young men obey, starting to wheel the cake down the long hall. 
INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The cake emerges from the hallway. The caterers begin singing "Happy Birthday", as Diane turns to see it and her eyes flash rage. As Diane comes storming over, we switch to SLOW MOTION. 
MINI (V.O.) See, to understand me, you need to understand that life, in my opinion, is all about new experiences. "Firsts" is what I call them. 
As she strides across the room, the look of vitriolic rage on Diane's face grows stronger with every step. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D) Somewhere around fourteen, when I had my first...rhymes with duck, I realized that the goal of life, any life, should be to cram as many "firsts" into it as possible. 
We switch back to real time. 
DIANE What the hell are you doing? I said wait until- (looking around) She's not even here, you morons! 
MINI No, Troy, I want to suck your dick right now! 
TROY Jesus, Mini, come on, get off! 
MINI (screaming) No, Troy! You said I could, now come on! 
She gets down on her knees, struggling to get a hand in his pants. The crowd howls with approval, as they almost can't believe their eyes. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MINI Let's see it! Come on, I want to suck your throbbing member right now! 
Troy finally pushes her off, humiliated, and runs down the hall as the mob laughs at him. Kayla looks at her gratefully and smiles. 
CUT TO: 
Mini applying frosty hot pink lipstick, making her lips as full as possible. 
DIANE (O.S.) Mini? 
Mini looks towards the door, deciding to ignore her mother. 
DIANE (O.S.) (screaming) 
MINI?! 
Mini turns towards the sound. 
MINI WHAT?! 
Diane comes storming in. 
DIANE When I call you, I expect you to answer. 
MINI (flatly) Sorry. 
DIANE Don't patronize me. 
MINI (sugar sweet) Sorry! 
DIANE If you're trying to get me to call you a spoiled little ungrateful bitch, you're out of luck, because I won't give you the satisfaction. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MINI Thanks, mommy. 
Diane's eyes narrow, as it's clear Mini knows exactly where her mother's buttons are. 
MINI (CONT'D) What do you want? 
DIANE I'm going out and I need you to wait for the delivery from the liquor store. They'll be here by nine. 
MINI Fine. 
Diane gives Mini the once over, lingering on her mini-skirt. Diane winces at the outfit. 
DIANE Just thought you should know, that makes your thighs look fat. 
MINI (deadpan) Gosh, you're right, mom, I'm such a cow. 
MINI (V.O.) It's a freakin' miracle I'm not anorexic after eighteen years of her little pep talks. 
MINI Have fun, don't do anything I wouldn't. 
Diane turns and leaves. 
DIANE (over her shoulder) Well, that doesn't leave much. 
MINI (under her breath) Cunt. 
Mini turns back to the mirror. 
INT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Mini pulls on a pair of thigh-high stockings, as a lit cigarette hangs from M her mouth. 
MINI (V.O.) My mother moved out to LA from Ohio when she was twenty to become an actress. Even though she was a total flatliner, somehow she managed to land a few bit parts on soaps...without screwing anyone. 
INT. A HALLWAY OF THE HOUSE - LATER. 
Mini walks along the corridor in a pair of "fuck me" pumps, as the doorbell is heard ringing. 
MINI (V.O.) When she gets really sauced, she'll pop the tapes in and make me watch, then I'll threaten to call the suicide hotline. 
She continues through the living room towards the door, hiking her mini skirt up a little. 
MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D) After a few years, she got desperate and spread 'em for this fat, ugly producer when he promised to give her a role in some bullshit cable series that was basically softcore porn. She got knocked up with me and he told her she couldn't be on the show, unless she hoovered me out. 
She reaches the front the door. 
CUT BACK TO: 18 YEAR OLD MINI MIXING HER MARTINI IN THE WET BAR. 
MINI (V.O.) So it pretty much went on like that until... 
MALE VOICE (O.S.) Mini? Diane? I'm home. 
MINI (V.O.) Five years ago, when she met Martin. 
Mini starts downing the drink in a few big gulps. M MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D) It was a win-win... 
INT. A HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT 
Mini, Diane and MARTIN TANNEN, 45, a trim executive in an Armani suit and $300 haircut, mingle at a large corporate cocktail party. Martin, a man who understands, in his world, style over substance is a way of life, works the crowd effortlessly. 
MINI (V.O.) He didn't want kids, but needed a ready-made family to help project an image of stability for his corporate outings...We finally got out of Reseda... 
CUT TO: 
Mini at the bar, stealing the drink of a TROPHY WIFE who has turned her back on it, to make a point to her OLDER HUSBAND. 
MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D) It was great for about a year... 
CUT TO: 
LATER. Martin finishes talking to a client and heads out on the balcony to get some air, where he sees Diane kissing a HANDSOME YOUNG EXECUTIVE off to the side. Martin stiffens as he watches in SLOW MOTION her tongue slip into his mouth. 
MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D) Then he figured out what he had married...by then it was too late. 
INT. THE FRONT DOOR TO THE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Martin puts his keys and cell phone on a table near the door. 
MINI (breezing past him) You're home early. 
MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D) First time in three months he's walked in before Letterman. He totally forgot my birthday party, and right now I'm thinking his pin cushion must have given him the walking papers or...found a new pin. 
MARTIN Yeah...uh... (searching) A dinner with a client got canceled. 
MINI (V.O.) Bingo. 
MINI Tough day? 
MARTIN About the same... 
They head back into the living room. 
MINI Protecting all those poor defenseless oil companies from those big bad environmentalists? M ARTIN Someone's got to make the payments on your Beemer. 
MINI (V.O.) He's a partner at a public relations firm, which is ironic because I can't remember the last time he and my mom were seen in public together...or had relations. 
He plops down on the couch, taking an electronic organizer out of his breast pocket. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARTIN Is your mother around? 
MINI No, she went to a party off Beachwood. She was in one of her "happy moods", so I doubt she'll be sleeping here... 
MARTIN Oh. 
MINI (innocently) If you were thinking of inviting a guest over. 
MARTIN (measured) I wasn't, but thanks for the concern...You're going out on a school night? 
MINI Yeah? 
Martin punches a few buttons on the organizer, his mind clearly elsewhere. 
MARTIN Mmm...Is your homework done? 
MINI Haven't even cracked a book. 
MARTIN (not listening) Mmm... 
INT. MINI'S BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER. 
Mini double checks her purse for everything: lipstick, compact, Altoids, a flask of liquor and a string of condoms. 
MINI (V.O.) Considering how many guys my mom has done in his bed, you've got to admire his resolve. He could've left her years ago, but with no pre- nup, he loses half and he just won't give in. 
EXT. THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER. 
Mini walks out the front door, revealing an impressive front of the house with stone pillars and a brick circular drive. Martin's MERCEDES 500 SL COUPE and Mini's BMW Z3 convertible sit in the open garage. 
MINI (V.O.) Their arrangement actually keeps everything very calm. 
Mini gets into her BMW. 
EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - NIGHT 
The BMW drives down the street, weaving in and out of traffic.             M MINI (V.O.) As I said, the rule of firsts guides my life. Once you've gotten into every club in town and had enough Ivy League lawyers cum too fast, drastic measures are called for. 
EXT. AN OFFICE BUILDING IN SHERMAN OAKS - DAY 
This time Mini walks in, dressed like a normal high school student, past a SECURITY GUARD. 
MINI (V.O.) But believe me, they didn't have too much trouble honoring that request. 
INT. AN IMPRESSIVE CORNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Mini is led in by a SECRETARY who presents Mini to one of the PENINSULA BUSINESSMEN sitting behind a large oak desk. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MINI (V.O.) I'd make house calls to offices at lunch hour and we'd say I was someone's niece or cousin in town on vacation. 
The man stands up and greets her like she's family, and then quickly shuts the door. E XT. A HOUSE IN THE HILLS - NIGHT 
Mini arrives in her convertible and gets out dressed in a cheerleaders uniform. 
MINI (V.O.) And then when football season started, Saturday through Monday... 
INT. THE ENTRANCE TO THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
A HUSKY MAN in a football jersey opens the door to find Mini waving her pom poms with a Texas sized grin on her face. 
MINI (V.O.) I was busier than Domino's. 
INT/EXT. A MULTI LEVEL PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT 
Mini drives into the garage. 
MINI (V.O.) Then one Thursday night I get a a last minute gig at a fuck pad in Westwood that some executive keeps so "wifey" doesn't find the motel bills on the gold card statements. They say I'm just his type...young. 
INT. THE LOBBY OF A MODERN APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Mini walks quickly through the lobby. 
MINI (V.O.) They tell me he's not big on the chit-chat and he loves paying extra for the stuff we charge extra for. 
INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT- MOMENTS LATER. 
Mini knocks on the door. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MALE VOICE (O.S.) It's open. 
INT. THE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
The executive "convenience" apartment is cold, sterile and clearly just used for short amounts of time. Mini opens the door, passing the closet, the bathroom door and then stops suddenly as she sees... 
MARTIN, her stepfather, sitting up in bed. 
She quickly turns away before he sees her face. 
MARTIN Hello? 
MINI (V.O.) Can you fucking believe it? 
Mini goes back towards the front door, panicking. She absently hangs her jacket up in the closet, to buy some time. 
MINI Uh...hi, (quickly adopting a southern accent) Sorry, I'm Mlate. 
ARTIN Don't worry about it. 
MINI Mind if I freshen up? 
MARTIN Sure. 
Mini ducks into the bathroom. 
INT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Mini shuts the door, turns on the light and looks at herself in the mirror. She's almost white from the shock. She looks down at the counter. 
MINI (V.O.) My own dad! My first thought was "how sick is he?" But then I started thinking...I'm one to talk, and...well... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Mini's expression softens as she examines herself closer. 
MINI (V.O.) Why not? I mean, he isn't my real dad...and talk about a first. The more I thought about it... 
A wicked glint dances across her eyes. 
MINI (V.O.) ...the more turned on I got. Then I thought that if my mother could do some strange guy in my bed, I could do her strange guy in this bed. 
MARTIN (O.S.) Everything alright in there? 
Martin just stares straight ahead, numb. After another moment he walks to the railing of the garage, staring down at the street below. 
MARTIN'S POV: A few cars rush by on the street below. It appears to be about a three or four story drop. 
He looks back at Mini. He starts to lift a leg over the railing. 
MINI Uh, that fall probably won't kill you, and considering what a caring nurturer your wife is, I don't think that's a risk you can afford to take. 
Martin looks down at the street for another moment. 
MINI (V.O.) God, what a drama queen. Don't let this little act fool you. He'd never let mom get all his money. 
He glances back at her, looking tortured. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MINI (V.O.) This is just his twisted public relations brain working overtime to figure what the appropriate response should be to fucking your stepdaughter...ah ha! Contemplate suicide! M artin backs away from the railing. 
MINI (V.O.) Now that's thinking outside the box. 
INT. AN ALL NIGHT COFFEE SHOP - LATER. 
Martin and Mini sit at a booth. Martin stirs his coffee looking shell shocked. Mini devours a plate of Belgian waffles covered with whipped cream. 
MINI (V.O.) We spent the next few hours just sitting there. I don't think we said three words. I think he was trying to find a way to justify the whole thing, but it was actually one of the sweetest nights I ever spent with a guy. 
EXT. VENTURA BLVD- JUST BEFORE DAWN. 
Mini drives home with the top down. 
MINI (V.O.) He told me it was a monumental mistake and that we should both never mention it again. I told him that was fine. 
INT. THEIR KITCHEN - MORNING 
Mini sits at the table eating cereal. Martin enters, looking a little guilty as they exchange an awkward glance. 
MINI (V.O.) Suddenly, he started coming home every night and even started really asking me about my homework. 
MARTIN Morning, Kiddo, you finish those math problems? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MINI (V.O.) Kiddo? 
Mini looks up at him, raising her eyebrows. 
MARTIN I'd be happy to help you with it, if you need. 
MINI Actually, I'm thinking about starting a 401K plan at work, could you help me pick a good mutual fund? 
Martin looks down uncomfortably. 
INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Martin watches television next to Diane, who's passed out with an empty bottle of vodka sitting on the coffee table. A BOTTLE OF PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION is open as well. Martin looks over at Diane, pokes her to make sure she's truly blitzed, checks his watch and stands up. I NT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Mini lies in bed under the covers, reading. The door to her room opens. She looks at the clock. It reads: 12:15am. Martin enters. 
MINI (V.O.) It took exactly one week. 
INT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The lights are off, and the two of them are going at it under the covers. 
MINI (V.O.) In the beginning, I was concerned this would violate my rule as he technically was a repeat customer, but then I realized this was my first affair, and with my stepfather no less. To be perfectly honest...I loved it. Talk about electric, knowing at any moment she could walk in was better than any drug. It reminded me of when I was young and brought guys home after school. 
INT. MINI'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Mini and Martin are locked in an embrace behind a steamed- over glass shower door. 
MINI (V.O.) At first, we were very discreet, only doing it when Joan Crawford wasn't home or was completely comatose. 
INT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Mini and Martin post coital, catching their breath, as they both stare at the ceiling. Martin looks over at her and they share a conspiratorial smile. 
MINI (V.O.) Then we got bolder, doing it before she would pass out. I think we were seeing exactly how far we could push the envelope. 
INT. THE LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
Mini and Martin poke their heads out from the hallway that leads to Mini's bedroom. Diane is watching TV with a martini glass in her hand. 
MINI (V.O.) One night we did it before "Entertainment Tonight" ended. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Them under the covers, but this time the lights in her room are on.              M MINI (V.O.) We even almost got caught. 
DIANE (O.S.) Mini? 
INT. THE GIRL'S BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER. 
The SCHOOL NURSE, HELGA HAUPTFÜHRER, 55 and very Aryan, enters the empty bathroom and walks into a stall. 
MINI (V.O.) The school nurse, a regimented Kraut lush named Helga Hauptführer, or "der Führer" as she was affectionately known, starts jonesing for her afternoon nip... I NT. THE STALL - CONTINUOUS 
Hauptführer sits down and takes a bottle of vodka out of her nurses coat. 
MINI (V.O.) ...exactly 45 minutes after lunch each day. 
She takes a long slug. 
INT. THE NURSE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Mini quickly picks the flimsy lock on the medicine cabinet with a paper clip. She quickly looks through the bottles. 
MINI (V.O.) Which leaves me free to help myself to the candy store. 
Mini finds what she needs and holds it up to read the label. 
CLOSE ON: THE LABEL indicating "RITALIN" and the dosage. 
Mini quickly closes the cabinet, walks out and stuffs the bottle in her pocket, just before Hauptführer enters. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MINI (V.O.) Thank god for the quack who invented ADD and the lazy parents willing to let "Der Führer" keep their kids comfortably numb on what basically amounts to legalized speed. 
INT. THE TANNEN'S KITCHEN - EVENING 
Mini stands at the counter, making her mom A MARGARITA. She's cutting up all kinds of tropical fruits and putting them into a blender. 
MINI (V.O.) My fears of mom giving up the sauce were unfounded. Actually, she started drinking more. 
She then takes a few tablets of Ritalin and grinds them up with their coffee grinder. She pours that into the blender and puts the lid on. 
MINI (V.O.) Which gave me the perfect opportunity to prescribe her a little pick-me-up. 
She turns on the blender. 
INT. DIANE'S DRESSING ROOM- MOMENTS LATER. 
Diane's getting dressed for a party, trying to gracefully camouflage her cast with jewelry. 
DIANE (annoyed) Mini! I asked you for that drink ten minutes ago! 
Mini walks in, carrying the margarita. D IANE Put it on the counter. 
MINI You're welcome. 
Diane takes a pain killer and washes it down with the margarita. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DIANE Mmm...this is really good. What's in it, Sweetie? 
MINI (V.O.) The first time in my life she calls me "sweetie" and I've just slipped her the mother of all Mickeys. 
MINI Oh, this and that. 
INT. A POSH PARTY IN THE HILLS - NIGHT 
The party is chock full of TROPHY WIVES and their decidedly less attractive HUSBANDS. Diane is in a full blown booze and Ritalin induced monologue, having cornered TWO WOMEN. 
DIANE My god, let me tell you, breaking my hand on that bitch's face... 
The two women recoil. 
DIANE ...was the best thing that ever happened to me. 
MINI (V.O.) Phase three: rambling incoherent monologues in public. 
DIANE I feel fantastic, just fabulous. I mean, I feel like I could run a marathon like that Bruce Jenner guy. He did that, right? Boy, I'll tell you before he had that face lift that made him look like a drag queen, I would've let him stick his javelin in me any day. 
Suddenly, her ears unconsciously pick up the strands of a conversation going on behind them between TWO HUSBANDS. 
HUSBAND #1 So I looked each and every juror in the eye- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DIANE (spinning around) I want to talk to you about juries, will you come and talk to me about juries? 
HUSBAND #1 Uh... 
DIANE I'd like to be on a jury and say "guilty!" or "sidebar!" What do you think goes on in all the sequestered situations? Do you think any of the jurors have sex with each other? I was once on an episode of Love Boat, playing the role of "Bikini Girl" and my line was "I'll have another," it was with "Isaac" at the pool bar. I had to suck one of the associate producers off to get the line, but it got me my SAG card, so I guess it was worth it. T he men shoot each other an uncomfortable glance. 
HUSBAND #2 Uh, I think I could use a refill. 
MALE VOICE (V.O.) Do you feel safe? 
DIANE (looking around) Who is this? 
MALE VOICE (V.O.) You didn't answer the question. 
Mini and the two skatepunks giggle with glee at the terror they're inflicting. 
She looks around, scanning THE MALL. Nothing seems out of the ordinary.            D IANE This isn't funny. I'm hanging up. 
MALE VOICE (V.O.) I wouldn't do that. 
DIANE If this is some kind of joke... 
MALE VOICE (V.O.) I assure you, I'm no joke. May I say that pink blouse is very fetching. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
Panicked, she heads for an exit. A FEW SHOPPERS look at her with concern. 
MALE VOICE (V.O.) Diane, your car is the other way. (menacing) Now answer my question. Do you feel safe? 
A whimper escapes from her throat as she looks around. 
DIANE I'm hanging up. 
MALE VOICE (V.O.) (very calm) Hang up and you're dead. 
DIANE (falling apart) Why are you doing this? 
MALE VOICE (V.O.) Can you see me? 
She scans the crowd frantically, then starts walking towards a VICTORIA'S SECRET STORE for help. 
MALE VOICE (V.O.) Pick me out something sexy. 
DIANE Leave me alone! 
MALE VOICE (V.O.) (very calm) But I'm so close to you... 
She stops, frozen in fear. Just then, the second SKATEPUNK comes up behind her, brushing into her. She jerks away from him. 
DIANE (screeching) Get away!!! 
EVERY SHOPPER within ear shot turns around, including TWO SECURITY GUARDS. 
SKATEPUNK #2 Take it easy, lady, what the hell's your problem? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
The skatepunk walks away. 
MINI and THE FIRST SKATEPUNK watch with amusement from an upper level as A SECURITY GUARD moves towards her. 
MALE VOICE (V.O.) Peek a boo...I'm coming for you...but that guard can't help you. Maybe you should make a run for that Gold Jag you drive home to Mira Loma Lane. 
DIANE (whimpering) How do you know where I live? 
MALE VOICE (O.S.) I know everything about you. 
DIANE No! 
DIFFERENT MALE VOICE (O.S.) 
Maam? 
Diane spins around to find TWO SECURITY GUARDS standing behind her. S ECURITY GUARD #1 
I'm going to have to ask you to leave the mall. We'll walk you to your car. 
DIANE No! I can't leave, he knows where I live! 
SECURITY GUARD #1 
Maam, you're going to have to leave. 
DIANE Did you hear me?! He knows where I live! 
SECURITY GUARD #1 
Who knows? 
She hands him the phone. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DIANE Him! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She hangs up the phone and looks back at the hallway, but as she does, she sees reflected in a wall mirror: ANOTHER BLACK CLAD FIGURE outside the living room window, but this one holds a HAND AXE. 
She turns around to look out the window. THE FIGURE raises the axe slowly. 
DIANE No...no...help! Help! 
She heads towards the front door to scream for help, but the axe wielding figure moves swiftly towards the door, making it unsafe for her to even try. Her face dissolves into utter despair, as she stumbles out of the room. 
INT. THE FAMILY DEN - CONTINUOUS 
Diane runs in to check that the sliding doors are locked. She clicks the lock shut, just as THE FIRST FIGURE with the knife appears in the door frame. 
DIANE Oh, God! Help! Someone! 
Diane is transfixed by her own eyes reflected in the lenses of the goggles. 
DIANE (softly ) No, please, no. 
She slowly backs away from the door, as the figure tries to open it. The door frame rattles on its track, as the figure D violently tugs at the handle. 
IANE Help! Someone please, help me! 
INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
She runs back in, checking THE WINDOW. It's clear. She decides to check the front door. She runs over and looks out the peep hole. 
PEEP HOLE POV: It appears clear. 
She starts to undo the lock and then slowly peeks through the slit in the door, leaving the chain on. 
THROUGH THE SLIT: everything looks good. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She opens the door and looks towards the front gate, which is open. She looks as if she's thinking of making a dash for the gates. Just then, from behind the gate, steps the AXE WIELDING FIGURE. 
It shakes a finger "no" at her, as it walks towards the house. Terrified, she slams the door, locking it behind her. She instinctively pushes her back against the door, hyper- ventilating. She looks up at the ceiling, her eyes filling with tears. 
DIANE Please God, please God...please! 
She looks around the room, searching for options. Suddenly, her eyes bulge as she sees THE KNIFE WIELDING FIGURE standing not ten feet away in the door to the kitchen. 
Diane screams and runs back down the hallway, towards the bedroom. The knife wielding figure follows behind her. She looks back, as it runs after her, grabbing her by the shoulder. She shrieks and struggles out of it's grasp before running in the bathroom and slamming the door. 
INT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Diane throws her weight against the door, struggling to keep the intruder out. She looks for anything to help her, and then sees in the window to the bathroom...THE AXE WIELDING FIGURE standing silently, staring back at her. D iane collapses to the floor in a pool of tears. She looks up again at THE WINDOW: It's empty. The pushing on the door suddenly stops, but Diane is so disturbed, she doesn't notice through her sobs. 
CLOSE ON: 
A PAIR OF BLACK GLOVED HANDS puts the bedroom phone back on its cradle. 
MINI (V.O.) Our work finished... 
INT. DOCTOR HOGGLY WOGGLY'S TYLER TEXAS BARBECUE - LATER. 
Mini and Martin laugh and giggle at the enormous slabs of beef put in front of them. 
MINI (V.O.) We rewarded ourselves on a job well done... 
INT. THE HALLWAY OF THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - LATER. 
Mini and Martin walk down the hallway towards the master bedroom. 
MINI (V.O.) And we returned home expecting to find her blabbering like a three year old. 
MINI Mom, we're home! 
MARTIN Diane, honey, we brought you a pulled pork plate! 
They reach the door to the bathroom. It's still closed. Martin and Mini exchange a look, not believing that Diane could still be in there. 
MARTIN Honey? You okay?...Honey? 
MINI Mom? 
Martin tries the door. Diane still appears to be leaning against it. He pushes hard on the door, opening it a few inches. Mini reaches in and shoves Diane over so they can can open the door. She appears drugged. They lay her flat and try to wake her up. 
MARTIN Diane, it's us, wake up. 
Mini slaps her hard across the face. 
MINI (feigning concern) Wake up, Mommy. 
MARTIN Mini. 
MINI Killjoy. 
MINI (V.O.) Our neighbor, Mike Rudell, the scumbag at my birthday, produces it and it's so twisted, I'm surprised I didn't think of it. 
On the screen, the host introduces THE COUPLE, who nervously walk out to the studio applause. 
MINI (V.O.) Take happy couples about to marry and try to break them up. The catch is the couples are always sent on dates with people just a little better looking than their fiancés. 
Then the TWO DATES are brought out to sit on either side of the couple. Both dates are, indeed, slightly better looking than the engaged couple. 
INT. THE BATHROOM - LATER. 
Mini checks Diane's pulse. 
MINI (V.O.) And we waited some more. 
INT. THE LIVING ROOM - LATER. 
Martin sits on the couch. He looks up as Mini comes in from the bathroom, shaking her head "no", indicating she's not I dead yet. 
NT. THE BATHROOM - LATER. 
Mini checks Diane's pulse again. 
MINI (V.O.) Typical mom, she managed to fuck up her last act of free will... 
INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The 11 O'clock news is starting, as Mini impatiently looks towards the hallway leading to the bathroom. 
MINI (V.O.) Finally, it was time to do the only humane thing. 
Mini stands up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MINI Come on, let's go. 
MARTIN What? 
MINI It's time to speed this up. 
MARTIN Speed this up? 
MINI We can't wait anymore, our alibi is only believable for maybe another hour. We can say that after dinner we went to a movie, but if she hasn't croaked by midnight, you can forget about this. 
Martin looks at her for a long moment, clearly realizing the implications of "speed this up". 
MARTIN No, I'm sorry, this is going somewhere I'm not prepared to go. 
MINI Oh, but you were prepared to sit here until the pills did her in? I hate to break it to you, but wherever you "weren't prepared to go"...the hypocrite express just rolled into the station. 
Martin stares straight ahead, coming to grips with the truth of his actions. 
MARTIN What are you suggesting? 
MINI Well, I thought we'd disembowel her and leave her for the raccoons. 
Martin recoils. 
MINI Kidding...God, you've lost your sense of humor. Don't worry, it'll be painless. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
Martin takes a deep breath, considering his options. 
INT. DIANE'S WALK IN CLOSET- MOMENTS LATER. 
Mini goes through her mother's clothes, as Diane lies crumpled in a heap on the floor. Martin looks on impatiently. 
MINI (V.O.) To be honest, I think we both knew in our hearts it would come to this. And as my first assisted suicide, I was going to make it flawless. M 
ARTIN Come on, we don't have time. 
MINI Look, if we're going to screw up the details we might as well call San Quentin and tell them to fire up the dutch oven. (off his confusion) The gas chamber? (exasperated) Martin, please, I can't explain everything. 
Mini holds a chic black Chanel suit up to the full length mirror. 
CUT TO: 
Mini applying make-up and lipstick to Diane's face in front of her vanity mirror. Martin holds Diane's head still. 
MARTIN I don't think this is a good idea. 
MINI Have you lost your mind, "Mr. Public Relations"? What's the one thing all her friends are going to be talking about when they find out? (waits for his answer) "How did she look"? Do you think anyone will think twice if the answer is "fabulous"? 
INT. THE GARAGE - CONTINUOUS 
The door to the dark garage opens and Mini turns on a light. Martin, carrying Diane (now dressed in the suit) over his shoulder, struggles through the doorway. 
INT. DIANE'S JAGUAR- MOMENTS LATER. 
Martin seems a bit taken aback by the question. 
MARTIN Of course, we did that too, but I couldn't feel a pulse. Mini took a course at school in CPR and tried that, but... (taking a breath) it didn't work. 
GARSON So your wife did this sometime between 8:00 and 11:33 when you placed the 911 call? 
MARTIN Yes. 
GARSON May I ask why you left your wife alone when she had been acting in such an unstable state? 
MARTIN We never thought she'd do anything like...this. After the episode in the mall, Diane hadn't left the house for three days and my daughter and I just needed a break. It's been a very stressful time. 
GARSON Of course. So this was your wife's car? 
MARTIN Yes. 
GARSON Was it in the garage when you left for dinner or did she drive it in? 
MARTIN What? 
GARSON Was it in the garage when you left? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MARTIN (a little flustered) Is, is that important? G ARSON Just trying to reconstruct what happened. 
MARTIN Oh, well...after she was brought home from the mall, the car was towed here and we put it in the garage. 
GARSON And no one drove it during those three days? 
MARTIN No, Mini and I have our own cars. 
GARSON We are going to have to impound it for a few days to take it to the crime lab. 
MARTIN Crime lab? Oh, okay. 
GARSON Again, purely routine. 
MARTIN Sure. 
GARSON Have you found a note yet? 
MARTIN (confused) I'm sorry? 
Garson's eyes flicker for a split second. 
GARSON A suicide note? The deceased usually leaves one. 
MARTIN Oh...right, no...not yet. But we haven't really looked. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
GARSON Mind if I take a look around? 
Martin hesitates for just a split second. 
MARTIN No...of course not. 
INT. MINI'S BEDROOM- MOMENTS LATER. 
Mini and Martin whisper together. 
MINI Who cares if we didn't leave a note? Just relax. 
MARTIN But they said it's-- 
MINI So what? He'll do his little dance and chalk it up to another failed actress who realized after forty she might as well be dead. 
MARTIN (remembering something) Oh, shit! 
MINI What? 
MARTIN The sweatsuits and goggles. 
MINI I already snuck out the back and threw them in Mike Rudell's garbage cans. 
MARTIN (exhaling) Good. 
MINI Angelpie, just relax, we did it, we're free. 
EXT. THE LAS HADAS RESORT- MANZANILLO MEXICO - DAY 
Martin and Mini arrive in a shuttle bus in front of the lush resort. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MINI (V.O.) After the funeral, I felt it would be good idea if we took a vacation and went somewhere where we could act like a real couple for the first time. 
MARTIN Detective, not to be overly sensitive, but do I need my lawyer here? Because these sound like the questions one asks when there's a homicide investigation. 
GARSON Mr. Tannen, I'd really like to just finish this up, I've got real homicides that need attention. How about if I just ask you some questions and the one's you don't want to answer, we'll just skip? 
MINI That sounds good, doesn't it, Dad? I mean, let's just get this over with. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Martin looks at Mini, trying hard not to allow his anger to escape for a second. 
MARTIN Fair enough. 
GARSON Terrific...now, the preliminary blood report indicated she had ritalin in her system. 
Mini's eyes shift between Garson and his note pad. 
MARTIN I wasn't aware my wife was taking ritalin. 
GARSON Neither was her physician, he had never prescribed it. 
MARTIN Well, as you may have discovered by now, my wife had substance abuse problems, I'm sure there were many drugs she took without a prescription. 
GARSON I know, but it's an odd drug to be taking. It's mostly given to adults and children with Attention Deficit Disorder to calm them. But in people who don't need it, it has the reverse effect, making them incredibly hyper and agitated. 
MARTIN Again, Detective, I really can't say why she was taking these drugs. 
GARSON Fair enough...Mr. Tannen, were you and your wife close? 
MARTIN No...we led, for the most part, separate lives. We had decided to stay together for Mini. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MINI (V.O.) O oh...sacrifice personal happiness for the benefit of the child. Excellent. 
GARSON I see... 
MARTIN Listen, Detective Garson, I must admit I don't see the relevance of these questions. Diane was an extremely disturbed person. Haven't you interviewed enough people who saw her at her worst? 
GARSON Yes, but what I'm still unclear about is her time of death. 
MARTIN Well, that makes two of us... Again, detective, we were out for the whole evening. 
GARSON (looking at his notes) After dinner you saw a movie that night? 
MARTIN That's right. 
MINI (V.O.) Start time 9 o'clock. 
GARSON What did you see? 
MARTIN That new Jackie Chan movie where the terrorists try to blow up Mount Rushmore. 
MINI (V.O.) Running time 115 minutes. 
GARSON Ahh...My buddy told me the end is crazy. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
MINI (V.O.) For god sakes, does he think we wouldn't actually see it? 
MARTIN Yeah, he slides down Washington's nose with the bomb strapped to him. 
MINI Dad...Don't give it away, he hasn't seen it yet. 
Martin turns to Mini, giving her a fatherly smile. 
MARTIN Another demerit... 
Mini rolls her eyes at Garson. 
GARSON That's okay...Where did you see it? 
MARTIN The Galleria. 
MINI (V.O.) Drive time 17 minutes. 
GARSON And you got home at? 
MINI (V.O.) Precisely... 
MARTIN 
MINI (V.O.) With 12 minutes of previews. You didn't think we'd forget the previews? 
MARTIN Now, if there aren't any more questions, it is a school night. 
GARSON No, that about wraps it up for now. 
MARTIN What the hell's gotten into you? I just expressed concern for you and you turn around and threaten me? Mini, in a relationship, it's okay to worry about someone else. 
MINI (V.O.) I kind of have to admire this. He really is one of the world's premiere bullshit artists. 
MARTIN Haven't you ever been in a relationship? 
The questions hangs in the air. Mini looks down, almost ashamed. 
MARTIN My god, you haven't. 
She tries to hold back the tears as she looks up. 
MINI Congratulations... (sniffling) you're my first. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
He comes over and gives her a very sweet hug. 
MARTIN Oh, angel. 
MINI (V.O.) And I'd like to thank the academy and god and, oh yeah, "Free Tibet". 
INT. AN ELEVATOR - MORNING 
Martin rides up in the elevator with other OFFICE WORKERS. His eyes look tired from staying up all night. 
MINI (V.O.) Fake tears aside...he actually was my first relationship. Which, in itself, was significant, because I had always felt that by living my life by the rule of firsts, I would never be able to find someone who could accept me on those terms. 
INT. MARTIN'S OFFICE - MORNING 
He strides off the elevator sending "hellos" and nods to his employees, as he passes the large corporate logo: "BOYD, MATHER, TANNEN & ASSOCIATES". 
MINI (V.O.) And I was willing to give him the chance to be that person... 
He reaches his desk, where his YOUNG SECRETARY, LOIS, is waiting with an envelope. 
MINI (V.O.) ...if he could just hold it together. 
MARTIN Morning, Lois. 
LOIS Mr. Tannen, this just arrived for you. 
She hands him a manila envelope marked "MARTIN TANNEN- VIA MESSENGER". He takes it from her and walks into his office, sitting down. He opens the package to find an 8x10 glossy photo of: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MINI SITTING WITH HIM AT THE POOL IN MEXICO. The caption reads: "THANK HEAVEN FOR LITTLE GIRLS". 
MINI (V.O.) That's when things started to get interesting. 
Martin looks up, the empty look in his eyes revealing a terrified mind already calculating the potential outcomes. He examines THE ENVELOPE. There is a SPEEDWAY COURIER STICKER, but no return address. 
INT. MARTIN'S CAR - LATER. 
Martin angrily honks his horn in slow traffic as he talks on his cell. 
MARTIN Lois, I need you to re-schedule the Chapman meeting... (listening) I know...Tell him...tell him it's an unavoidable emergency. 
INT. SPEEDWAY COURIER - DAY 
Martin stands at the front desk, talking to A CLERK. 
MARTIN What do you mean you don't keep records on who your senders are? 
CLERK When it's paid cash, we only keep records on packages, not envelopes. 
EXT. THE SPEEDWAY BRANCH - CONTINUOUS 
Martin walks outside, frustrated. His cell goes off and he answers it. 
MARTIN Yeah? 
LOIS (O.S.) Mr. Tannen, I just spoke to Mr. Chapman...he told me to tell you that he's going to be seeking a new firm to handle his company's needs. 
Martin's jaw tightens. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARTIN Thank you, Lois. 
Martin hangs up the phone, as he looks up, he sees across the street a large sign on a modern office building: RUDELL WORLDWIDE ENTERTAINMENT. 
Martin closes his eyes, trying to remain in control. 
INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM AT MARTIN'S FIRM - LATER. 
Martin walks into the office to find his partners, STEVE BOYD and CHARLES MATHER waiting for him. Martin looks surprised and concerned. 
RUDELL It was just finished. I'm sorry your mother never got to see it completed. 
MINI I know she'd approve. 
RUDELL If you don't mind me asking, ...how are you doing? 
MINI It's been hard, but I guess I've just been telling myself that she's probably much happier where she is now. 
RUDELL You're absolutely- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MINI Positive!? 
Mini giggles, almost embarrassed. 
RUDELL (chuckling) Well, that too, but "correct" was the word I was thinking of. Do you like the show? 
MINI Oh, god, it's my favorite. I love how you never know if the couples will decide to stay together. 
RUDELL I could arrange for you to go to the set one day if you'd like, or even be a contestant? 
MINI A contestant? Really? 
RUDELL Sure, those dates are really quite harmless. You just spend an evening with the person. We prep you on what to say before the show. 
MINI It sounds like fun. 
Rudell lets his eyes take a walk all over her. Mini, keenly aware, blushes. 
RUDELL Anyway, what's on your mind? 
MINI Well, um...this may sound strange, but you haven't seen any suspicious looking people around our house lately? 
RUDELL No, is everything okay? 
MINI Yes, it's just that since mom's death, someone sent us a photo of Martin and I together. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
RUDELL Together? 
MINI It indicated that we were...I know this sounds crazy, but...a couple. 
RUDELL A couple? You and Martin? Hmmm...I mean, certainly older men and younger women are an (searching again) ...accepted part of society, but for someone to do that, well...it's just tasteless. 
MINI Exactly, so we're just trying to figure who Rit could be. 
UDELL Hmm, I haven't noticed anyone at all...Out of curiosity, what kind of a picture could they send you to indicate that you and Martin were together? 
MINI Oh, it wasn't like we were naked or anything. I mean, of course, he's seen me naked, he is my step- father. 
RUDELL Of course. 
EXT. RUDELL'S POOL - LATER. 
Mini and Rudell sit at a table, enjoying iced teas, as Mini flirts shamelessly with him. 
MINI (V.O.) Much to my surprise, I was invited to stay for a refreshing beverage... 
EXT. RUDELL'S HOT HOUSE - LATER. 
Rudell shows Mini around his collection of rare tropical flowers. He plucks a tiger lily off a stem and puts it in her hair. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MINI (V.O.) I knew he had had no shortage of young women in his bed, but he had been paying for it in one form or another for a long time. 
EXT. RUDELL'S PUTTING GREEN - LATER. 
Rudell shows Mini how to use a pitching wedge on the small putting green off his back patio. He stands behind her, wrapping his arms around her, guiding her arms through the swing. 
MINI (V.O.) And the one undeniable fact I had learned from Martin is that there is no greater thrill or triumph in a man's life... 
INT. RUDELL'S KITCHEN - LATER. 
Rudell makes her a giant banana split, covering it with whip cream. 
MINI (V.O.) ...than getting a ripe young woman to open the gates to heaven for no other reason than she wanted to. 
He accidently gets some whip cream on his nose. Mini reaches over and wipes it off, licking her finger clean. Rudell tries to hide the wonderment in his eyes. 
MINI (V.O.) Frankly, I'm surprised the anticipation of pulling off a mother-daughter double dip didn't give him a stroke right there. E XT. RUDELL'S FRONT GATE - LATER. 
Mini walks out, skipping down the path, singing "The Candy Man" to herself. 
MINI "Who can take tomorrow? Dip it in a dream, separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream, the candy man, oh, the candy man can" 
MINI (sniffling) You gonna cuff me, Copper!? 
Garson looks at Mini, clearly not convinced of her innocence. 
GARSON She's free to go. 
INT. THE LOBBY OF MARTIN'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 
Martin gets off the elevator and heads across the lobby. GARSON and A UNIFORMED OFFICER approach him. Martin looks a little unnerved to see them. 
GARSON Ah, Mr. Tannen, we were just coming up to see you. Have you got a minute? 
MARTIN Detective, I told you no more questions without my lawyer. 
GARSON I think you'd better call him. 
INT. AN INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER. 
Martin sits at a table, conferring with his lawyer, NED VOLANT, an impeccably dressed operator with a mane of thick, heavily gelled hair. Garson sits across from them. 
GARSON There's a small discrepancy that I can't quite figure out and I was hoping you might be able to explain it. 
MARTIN I suppose I can try. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GARSON The final toxicology report came back and your wife definitely didn't die from the pills. She wasn't conscious past 9:30, but it was the fumes that killed her. M ARTIN Well, hallelujah, thanks for the update- 
VOLANT Martin, easy. 
MARTIN I'm sorry, but this is harassment. 
GARSON See, here's what I needed to ask you. The gas tank in the Jag was almost full, just a gallon had been used. 
MARTIN And? 
GARSON Well, if she was unconscious by 9:30, that means the car must have been running for at least two hours when you found her. An unconscious person can't turn on a car, right? 
VOLANT Detective, with all due respect, could you get to the point? 
GARSON Well, here's where I get confused, see, that particular model idling for two hours will burn at least four gallons of gas. 
Martin tries to remain calm, as the panic starts to settle in for a long stay. 
GARSON So, there's really no way the tank could be almost full if it was running for two hours. Is there? 
He looks at Martin, waiting for an answer. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
GARSON So, I guess what I'm asking is, whose idea was it to put her in the car? 
VOLANT Martin, don't say anything. 
GARSON Now, Mr. Tannen, you clearly had the most to gain from her death, but I've learned from a number of your wife's friends that she and Mini had a strained relationship. 
VOLANT Again, Detective, my client won't be answering anything, so let's just cut the cat and mouse. 
GARSON I'd like Mr. Tannen to know that if he's trying to be a protective father by covering up something Mini did, I'd be careful. The district attorney is viewing this case as an opportunity to show the public that the rich don't get away with murder in this town. 
Martin whispers something in Volant's ear and he in turn, V whispers back. 
OLANT Does this mean he's offering Mr. Tannen immunity if he says he was protecting his daughter? 
Garson takes a sip of water, as Martin anxiously waits for his answer. 
GARSON It's a strong possibility. But he wants Mr. Tannen to know he will go for the maximum sentence if he doesn't. No manslaughter, no plea bargains, nothing. 
Martin's eyes shift slightly. 
INT. ANOTHER INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Garson, now finished with Martin, sits across from Mini and her lawyer, HERB PELHAM, who doesn't look nearly as confident as Martin's lawyer. 
MINI It was Colonel Mustard in the library with the candlestick. 
Garson smiles at Mini, admiring her resolve. 
PELHAM (nervously) Uh...Miss Drogues, as your lawyer- 
MINI Don't wet your pants, I know when to shut up and swallow... 
Mini takes out a sip a water, letting a trickle of liquid roll down her chin. 
MINI ...my tongue. 
Even Garson appears a little intimidated by the overt flirtation. 
GARSON Look, the fact that the marriage was unhappy and there was no pre- nup gives all the motive to Martin. 
MARTIN You? You went on- 
MINI Yeah, I thought it'd be a gas...now shhh... 
CLOSE ON THE SCREEN: 
HOST Jason, you said that the reason you wanted to come on the show was to test your ability to resist temptation. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JASON (a bit nervous) Well, since Becky and I have dated since high school and decided to remain virgins until marriage, I just wanted to go on a date with another girl just to see how I would react. You know, whether there'd be any feelings of doubt about my decision? 
HOST So, after dinner, what happened? 
JASON Oh, gosh, well she suggested we go to a dance club she knew. I'm not really a good dancer, but I said "yes." 
BECKY (hurt) We never go dancing. 
Jason smiles at her uncomfortably. 
HOST So, Mini, is Jason a good dancer? M INI Well, he's a damn quick learner, and not just at dancing. 
MARTIN shoots a look at Mini 
MINI Martin, for god's sake, that was their line. You think I talk like that? 
CLOSE ON THE SCREEN: 
HOST Oh, really? So there was some other teacher-student stuff going on? 
JASON (uncomfortable) Uh, no, not really- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MINI Oh, come on, what about when we went back to your place? 
BECKY You what?! 
JASON I, I don't know what she's talking about. 
MINI Come on, don't be bashful. He put on some soft music and- 
JASON No! This isn't true, why are you- 
MINI We started kissing and- 
BECKY Jason! 
JASON (to Mini) Shut up! 
STUDIO AUDIENCE OOOOHHHHH! 
MINI But, Jay-Jay, it was really special. (to the host) He loves to be called "Jay-Jay". 
BECKY You, you... 
MINI Let me tell you, Becky, you're in for a wild ride from this Bronco. 
STUDIO AUDIENCE WHOOOOOOAAAA! 
CUT TO: 
MARTIN staring at Mini. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
MARTIN Did, did you... 
BECKY (O.S.) You slept with her?! 
MINI God, Martin, it was a one time thing. He was a virgin, how could I say "no"? Believe me, she'll thank me after their wedding night. 
MARTIN You had me come home early to- 
MINI Don't be jealous. It won't happen again. It was just a goof. 
Martin stands there, speechless, while ON THE SCREEN: 
BECKY dissolves into a puddle of tears as Jason tries to console her. Suddenly, she runs off stage. 
MARTIN picks up the remote and hits "mute". 
MARTIN Rudell? He let you go on? 
MINI Yeah, I thought it would be fun. I wasn't really supposed to, you know, "go all the way" but- 
MARTIN I can't believe you...th-that couple, you ruined their relationship. M INI Excuse me, but the show is called Absolutely Positive for a reason. Clearly, the only thing Jason was positive about was- 
He heads for the door again. 
MARTIN Now, if you'll excuse me... 
Mini grabs him again, desperate. 
MINI Please-- Look, I'm sorry, I really am, but this isn't the answer! 
Martin grabs her wrist, forcefully. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (7) 
MINI You're hurting me! 
MARTIN (through his teeth) Calm down or I'll snap it in two, do you hear me? 
Mini nods her head. 
MARTIN Now, I want you to wait here for me. Do you understand? 
Mini nods again. 
MINI (softly) Please don't do this. 
He lets go and calmly walks towards the sliding doors to the back yard. Mini watches him go. 
EXT. RUDELL'S FRONT DOOR- MOMENTS LATER. 
Martin stands outside and rings the bell. The door opens and Rudell stands there in a smoking jacket and pajamas. He looks Martin up and down with a self-satisfied smile, as Sinatra's R "Nice and Easy" is playing on his stereo in the background. 
UDELL Martin, what a surprise, how are you? 
MARTIN Just watched Mini on your show. 
RUDELL Ahh...was tonight the night? We taped that two weeks ago. Let me tell you, I have girls audition all the time for me and... (enjoying this) She was fucking incredible. 
Rudell watches Martin's eyes for a reaction. 
MARTIN A natural, huh? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RUDELL Like a duck to water...and totally willing to take direction. 
Martin's jaw tightens, as Rudell is loving twisting the knife in him. 
RUDELL I wish all the girls I worked with had her...how can I put this?... Need to please. 
MARTIN You son of a bitch... 
Martin explodes, punching Rudell in the mouth, sending him staggering backwards inside. 
SINATRA (V.O.) "Let's take it nice and easy..." 
INT. THE TANNEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Mini stands at the window, nervously waiting on the phone. She looks out THE WINDOW at the fight beginning in Rudell's house. 
MINI (frantic) Yes, hello, you've got to send a police car to 2376 Mira Loma Lane right away! My father's gone crazy, I think he's going to hurt our neighbor...yes 2376 Mira Loma, oh god, hurry! 
INT. RUDELL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Rudell struggles to his feet and charges Martin, shoving him against his wet bar. Rudell grabs a glass and smashes it over Martin's face, grinding the glass into his face. 
SINATRA (V.O.) "Hey, baby, what's your hurry? Relax, don't you worry..." 
Martin screams in agony and throws Rudell off him. Rudell crashes into a glass coffee table, smashing it to pieces. 
Martin tries to pick the glass out of his eyes, as Rudell gets to his feet and grabs one of metal legs of the shattered coffee table. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
He rushes Martin, clubbing him in the head with it. Martin crumples to the floor and Rudell starts kicking him. Martin grabs Rudell by the ankles and flips him. 
The two men grapple on the floor. 
MARTIN Where are they?! Huh? 
RUDELL What are you talk- 
MARTIN Don't fuck with me! The negatives! 
RUDELL What?! 
EXT. RUDELL'S PATIO AND POOL - CONTINUOUS 
Rudell and Martin crash through the plate glass window on to the brick patio. Martin gets to his feet first and grabs a golf club propped up on a chair next to the putting green. 
A MAILMAN hauls a bag of sympathy cards to the front door. She leads him inside where he dumps them next to three other bags full. 
EXT. A DUSTY TWO LANE ROAD IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY - DAY 
The sun is blistering hot as Mini drives Martin's Mercedes convertible with the top down. 
MINI (V.O.) Martin's assets were put in a trust for me and since I was eighteen, I was allowed to live by myself. 
She turns down another road at a sign reading "LOMPOC STATE PRISON, 5 MILES". 
INT. A VISITING ROOM AT LOMPOC - DAY 
Mini and Martin sit facing each other behind a plexiglas barrier. There are dividers between each phone to provide the prisoners with a little privacy. 
MINI I'm sorry I forgot to bring that book you wanted. 
MARTIN It's okay, Myou can mail it. 
INI Are you okay? You look like you haven't showered in days. 
MARTIN (disturbed) Well...uh...you have to be careful about sh-...So how's school? 
MINI (excited) You'll never guess what happened. 
MARTIN What? 
MINI I was voted valedictorian! 
MARTIN But don't you have to be- 
MINI The best student? I know! But the students took a vote and they said they wanted me to have it for demonstrating remarkable courage in the face of unspeakable loss. 
MARTIN (smiling sadly) I wonder how the real valedictorian feels? 
MINI Like slitting his wrists with the sharp end of a protractor. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARTIN Is Rudell out of his coma yet? 
MINI I don't know, why? 
MARTIN Why? (taken aback) Mini, if he recovers, he may try to blackmail you with those pictures. 
MINI (nonchalant) Oh...I wouldn't worry about that. 
MARTIN But if the D.A. got those pictures, you could- 
MINI I'm pretty sure he won't be doing anything with them. 
He looks suddenly very worried. 
MARTIN Mini, you're not thinking of sleeping with him to keep him quiet? Because I've met people in here who could help us with him, if it comes to that. 
MINI Help us? 
MARTIN They know people on the outside we could...pay to make sure he doesn't try to take advantage of you. 
MINI Oh, gosh, that's so romantic. It's like you're a real life criminal with connections and everything, but I'm a little surprised you haven't figured it out yet. 
MARTIN What?

Over jungle sound effects, the CAMERA is low, moving through brush from the POV of a stalking animal. As the brush parts, revealing Wall Street and the New York Stock Exchange, we HEAR the resonant voice of GENE HACKMAN. 
GENE HACKMAN (V.O.) The world of investing can be a jungle. 
1A      WE SEE a charging, snorting BULL.                             1A 
GENE HACKMAN (V.O.) Bulls. 
1B      WE SEE a ferocious, growling BEAR.                            1B 
GENE HACKMAN (V.O.) Bears.   Danger at every turn. 
Pretentious CLASSICAL MUSIC kicks in. 
GENE HACKMAN (V.O.) That's why we at Stratton Oakmont pride ourselves on being the best. 
1C-1D   VARIOUS SHOTS -- a conservative young MAN reviews a stock   1C-1D portfolio with a wealthy older COUPLE; a smiling young WOMAN sits before a computer talking into a headset. 
GENE HACKMAN (V.O.) Trained professionals to guide you through the financial wilderness. 
1E      WE SEE the Stratton "team" - an ethnically diverse group      1E of ACTORS with their handsome, grey-templed "CHAIRMAN". 
GENE HACKMAN (V.O.) Stratton Oakmont. Stabilty. Integrity. Pride. 
1F      WE SEE a shot of the black glass Stratton Building, and:      1F

Absolute bedlam. 300 drunken STOCKBROKERS, most in their early 20s, chant wildly as JORDAN BELFORT, handsome, 30, stands beside a DWARF dressed in tights, cape & helmet. 
JORDAN Twenty five grand to the first cocksucker to nail a bullseye! 
The "bullseye" is a large dollar sign in the middle of a giant velcro "dartboard". The Wolf of Wall Street      Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13 
JORDAN (CONT'D) Watch and learn, people! 
The Brokers go apeshit as Jordan grabs the Dwarf by his pants and collar. In the Crowd, cash flies as side bets are made. Jordan winds up, aims for the "dartboard". 
JORDAN (CONT'D) One.   Two.      Throw!! 
The Brokers cheer, and as the screaming Dwarf takes flight, hurtling toward camera, we FREEZE FRAME: 
JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) My name is Jordan Belfort. No, not                      * him, me. I'm a former member of                         * the middle class raised by two accountants in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens.

Jordan, 7, smiles as he poses behind a lemonade stand, his parents Max and Leah behind him; Jordan, 13, stands holding a styrofoam cooler, selling ices on the beach; Jordan, 18, smiles as he holds an Amway sales brochure.

A CHERRY RED Ferrari Testarossa ZOOMS down the L.I.E. 
JORDAN (V.O.) --which really pissed me off because it was three shy of a million a week. 
The Ferrari weaves in and out of traffic. 
JORDAN (V.O.) Hey, my Ferrari was white, like Don Johnson's in Miami Vice. 
We see the same Ferrari, now in WHITE, as it zooms away, a BLONDE head bobbing up and down in Jordan's lap.

We see NAOMI, 24, blonde and gorgeous, a living wet dream in LaPerla lingerie. 
JORDAN (V.O.) My wife, Naomi, the Duchess of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, a former model and Miller Lite girl. 
Naomi licks her lips; she's incredibly, painfully hot. 
JORDAN (V.O.) Yeah, she was the one blowing me in the Ferrari, so put your dick back in your pants.

JORDAN Wait a second. You're telling me if I sell two thousand dollars worth of stock, my commission is a thousand bucks? 
DWAYNE Technically, yeah, but not even the biggest schmuck buys two thousand dollars of this shit. 
28   INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - (LATER THAT) DAY       (DEC '87)         28 
As others Brokers bark into phones, Jordan sits, phone cradled in his shoulder, making notes. A few beats, then: 
JORDAN (into phone) Mr. Fleming, good morning, Jordan Belfort with Investor's Center in New York City. You recently responded to one of our ads... 
A few of the other Brokers glance over, eavesdropping. 
JORDAN (CONT'D) The reason I'm calling is that an extremely exciting investment opportunity crossed my desk today. Typically our firm recommends no more than five stocks per year: this is one of them... 
A few more Brokers look over... 
JORDAN (CONT'D) Aerotyne International is a cutting edge tech firm out of the Midwest, awaiting imminent patent approval on a new generation of radar equipment... 
LATER.   Now all the Brokers listen in rapt attention. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
JORDAN (CONT'D) -- so if Aerotyne's shares rise to only a dollar -- and our research indicates they could go much, much higher -- your profit on a mere three thousand dollar investment would be upwards of fifty thousand... That's right, you could pay off your mortgage. 
Seconds tick by; an eternity, then he starts writing: 
JORDAN (CONT'D) Four thousand dollars, will that be check or money order?... Thank you, sir. 
Jordan hangs up, scrawls out a "buy" ticket. 
JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Just like that I made two grand. The other guys looked at me like I'd just discovered fire. 
Toby Welch and the other cave-Brokers stare at him. 
TOBY WELCH How'd you fuckin' do that? 
29   INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - (ANOTHER) DAY (FEB `88)               29 
Jordan sits at his desk in mid-pitch, totally focused. 
JORDAN It's a rock-solid company, sir, it's the next Microsoft... Six thousand. Terrific. 
As Jordan continues talking, wrapping up the sale... 
JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Though I knew I was selling garbage, within twelve weeks I was making a fortune. 
And as he starts scrawling out a buy ticket... 
JORDAN (V.O.) And as a wise man once told me, my only responsibility was to put meat on the table.

30    INT. KACANDES DINER - BAYSIDE - DAY        (JUN `88)                 30 
Wearing a suit, Jordan sits in a booth reading the Wall Street Journal as a WAITRESS serves the food. DONNIE AZOFF, preppy-looking, 25, with horn-rims and bright white teeth approaches from the takeout counter. 
DONNIE That your Jag in the lot? 
JORDAN Yeah. 
DONNIE Nice ride.      Donnie Azoff. 
JORDAN Jordan Belfort. 
DONNIE I've seen it around. We live in the same building. Twelfth floor? (Jordan nods) What do you do, bro? 
JORDAN Stock broker. 
DONNIE Kids furniture, me and my brother- in-law. Making any money? 
JORDAN Seventy grand last month. 
DONNIE Get the fuck out. You made seventy grand in one month. 
JORDAN Seventy two actually. 
Donnie studies him, isn't sure if he's full of shit. 
DONNIE Tell you what. You show me a pay stub with $72,000 on it, I'm quitting my job right now and coming to work with you.

DONNIE (CONT'D)                      * Holy shit. 
Jordan watches as Donnie crosses to a pay phone and dials. 
JORDAN (V.O.) And he did quit his job, which I thought was a little weird. I mean I had just met this fucking guy. 
A few beats, then into phone: 
DONNIE Yo Paulie, it's Donnie...     Yeah, listen, I quit. 
Jordan studies Donnie as he continues his conversation... 
TERESA It's beautiful. 
Jordan helps her try it on.       She smiles, but he detects a wave of... something. 
JORDAN They're small, I know, but the stones are really high quality. 
TERESA No, no.   I love it. 
JORDAN Then what? 
They sit in silence.       Finally: 
TERESA I don't know, it's just -- these stocks, these crappy companies. 
JORDAN In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
TERESA Why can't you be legitimate now? 
JORDAN It's not illegal, Teresa, technically. I mean they're real stocks, they're just... 
TERESA Never gonna make anybody money. (a few beats; then) Wouldn't you feel better selling this junk to rich people, who can afford to lose the money at least? 
JORDAN Rich people don't buy penny stocks. 
TERESA Why not? 
And on Jordan's look: 
JORDAN (V.O.) Because they're too smart, that's why not.

The camera PUSHES IN on Jordan as he stands before a large dry erase board. 
JORDAN (V.O.) But what if they didn't sound like jerk-offs? What if I took this bunch of nincompoops and molded them in my own image? I reinvented the company, gave it a new image, a new name. Something patrician, blue-blooded, something that reeked of tradition and anti- semitism. 
And as his Brokers settle in to folding chairs-- 
JORDAN Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton Oakmont.   The clients we've gone after in the past -- they're done. We will now target exclusively the wealthiest one percent of Americans. The methods we've used -- over. Loud, obnoxious sales hype is worthless with these people. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 JORDAN (CONT'D) In military terms it's like carpet- bombing -- noisy, menacing and only marginally effective. As Stratton brokers you will be laser- guided smart-bombs aimed at high- priority targets. You will establish an initial relationship with your clients selling only blue chip stocks -- then and only then will you attempt to sell the pink sheets, where the real money is. Now the key to every sale is this: 
Jordan writes the word "URGENCY" on the board. 
JORDAN (CONT'D) No one buys stock unless he thinks it's going up and going up now. You must convince your client to buy before the takeover happens, before the lawsuit is settled, before the patent is granted. If he says I'll think about it and call you back, it's over, you're dead! No one calls back! So you have to create urgency --

JORDAN --and once Kodak settles the lawsuit, institutions will be permitted to buy their shares in large blocks again. And when that happens, which is any day now, what do you think will happen to the price of Kodak stock?

Jordan motions to DANIELLE HARRISON, 19, pretty, sitting       * in a chair nearby. Behind her, Rugrat uses clippers to shave her thick brown mane. The place goes nuts. 
JORDAN (CONT'D) FYI, Danielle tells me she's using the money for breast implants! Is this a great company or what?!! 
More wild applause as Jordan signals across the bullpen to Donnie. We hear the opening strains of "Stars & Stripes Forever" as he opens the door to a

Bustling with activity. Jordan enters, crosses toward his office. Off to the side of the bullpen, he notices three dozen YOUNG MEN in business suits. He approaches his assistant JANET, 20s, dressed all in black. 
JORDAN The hell's all this? 
JANET The Forbes article.    They're applying for jobs. 
They spot Jordan, start clamoring, waving their resumes. 
JOB APPLICANTS Mr. Belfort!    Over here! Sir! The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
JORDAN (V.O.) Forbes had made me a superstar. Every day dozens of money-crazed kids beat a path to my door with resumes they hadn't even bothered to spellcheck. 
Jordan crosses through the packed bullpen, where 150 BROKERS, no older than 22, are crammed elbow to elbow talking into phones. Some have pets, which they tend to while they work -- iguanas, snakes, turtles, even a chimp. Others are getting shoulder rubs by Masseuses or being fitted for suits by a TAILOR. Over the above: 
JORDAN (V.O.) If we hired `em, they dropped out of college overnight and blew whatever allowance they had on a new suit from our in-house tailor. The median age of our brokerage couldn't get served in the bar down the street.

MAX You zip it, too, Azoff, those boiling teeth of yours are hurting my fucking eyes! (turning to Jordan) My own son! From my very loins! What do you think this is?                          * 
JORDAN Will you calm down -- 
MAX You don't think there's any end in sight, do you? It's all one giant party to you schmendricks! The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 MAX (CONT'D) (holds up AMEX bill) $26,000 for one dinner!! 
JORDAN Donnie ordered sides. 
DONNIE Yeah, that was... Sorry. 
MAX (glowering) What is EJ Entertainment?     What is EJ Entertainment?! 
JORDAN (restraining a grin) You tell me, Dad. 
MAX It's a goddamn prostitution ring is what it is!! 
Jordan feigns shock, turns to Donnie: did you know it was a prostitution ring?! 
DONNIE Doesn't the IRS allow for T&A? 
MAX It's T&E and stop fucking with me! What kind of hookers take credit cards, anyway?! 
Jordan takes the bill, starts flipping through it. 
JORDAN (V.O.) In Stratton parlance, there were three kinds of hookers. There were blue chips, the top of the line. Model material. They were priced between $300 and $500 and made you wear a condom unless you gave them a hefty tip, which I always did. 
77A   A "BLUE CHIP" HOOKER FLOATS THROUGH, SURROUNDED BY             *77A STRATTON BROKERS.                                              * 
JORDAN (V.O.) Then came NASDAQs, who were pretty, but not great, usually in the two to three hundred dollar range. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

DONNIE Ssshhhhoes... shhhoooess... 
Jordan suspects Donnie may actually be onto something. But just then... 
SEA OTTER Holy fuck. 
Jordan peers over the balcony where Sea Otter's looking. 
NAOMI LAPAGLIA. 22, the hottest blonde ever, has entered the party with her date BLAIR. She smiles, full lips parting over perfect white teeth, a ridiculously short dress barely covering her long tan legs and full breasts. 
RUGRAT My nutsack's about to explode. 
ROBBIE                                * Someone's gotta take that down. 
There's no debate who that someone should be. Eyes locked on Naomi, Jordan makes his way downstairs. 
WITH NAOMI taking in the party, her eyes flitting to things: art, chandeliers, crystal, etc. 
NAOMI (V.O.) A lotta people would look at me and think: "golddigger, she's out to land the richest husband she can." But you see, I came from nothing. Like, below the poverty line. And when you come from nothing, being rich means never having to go back to that. 
Jordan approaches CRISTY, 20s, one of his guests. 
CRISTY Jordan, hey. (he smiles; Cristy picks up his intent) Have you met my friend Naomi? 
Jordan takes Naomi's hand, doesn't let go. 
JORDAN Naomi. 
NAOMI You have an awesome house. I don't think I've ever been in a house like this. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13 
JORDAN You like it? I just got it. I guess it's okay. Six bedrooms, two hot-tubs, one off the master suite overlooking the water. You like to jet-ski? 
Naomi's date Blair offers his hand to break them apart. Toby Welch lurks behind him, giving him the evil-eye. 
BLAIR Hi.   Blair Hollingsworth. 
Jordan barely acknowledges him, focused on Naomi. 
Outside, HILDY AZOFF chats with Teresa. Her eyes stray to Jordan chatting up Naomi. Teresa's eyes follow hers and sees them. Ouch. Hildy goes. 
JORDAN You're telling me you've never jet- ski'ed in your life?! 
NAOMI Never. 
BLAIR Y'know, we really should hit it, there's two other parties we're s'posed to get to -- 
JORDAN What?    You just got here.   Stay. 
Naomi looks like she'd like to.     Hildy approaches, introduces herself, then: 
HILDY Jordan, Teresa needs your help. 
JORDAN With what? 
HILDY I dunno, you'll have to ask your wife what she wants. 
Jordan sees: Teresa is watching from afar. 
DONNIE(O.S.) Oh sweet Jesus! 
Jordan turns to see a drunk Donnie, cock in hand, jerking off to Naomi. Hildy comes running over. The Wolf of Wall Street     Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13 
HILDY Donnie!   What the fuck are you doing?! 
During the melee that follows -- Hildy admonishing Donnie, Blair removing Naomi from the party -- 
JORDAN (V.O.) The day I met Naomi was the day I truly became the Wolf. Every guy wanted her -- so I had to have her. 
-- Jordan watches her go. Naomi shoots a glance back to him and, like that, he's hooked.

Romantic; elegant. Over a bottle of `53 Lafite, Jordan sits in mid conversation with Naomi, who is stunning in a low-cut black cocktail dress. 
JORDAN Bay Ridge.      That's near Staten Island? 
NAOMI Brooklyn, across the Verrazano Bridge. Guinea gulch. Ever been? 
JORDAN You're Italian? 
NAOMI My dad's side. Also Dutch, German, English -- I'm a mutt. Actually I have family over there, in London. My Aunt Emma. 
JORDAN That explains it then. 
NAOMI What? 
JORDAN (smiles) You're a Duchess. The Duchess of Bay Ridge. 
Naomi smiles, flags a passing WAITER. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
NAOMI Could I have a straw please? 
The Waiter nods, heads off.     A few beats, then:

89   INT. LIMOSINE - NIGHT (AUG `92)                                 89 
Giggling like a child, Jordan pours coke from a vial, creating a little mound atop one of Naomi's breasts. 
JORDAN Hold still, don't move. (to the Driver) Watch the potholes! The Wolf of Wall Street     Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
More giggling, then he snorts the coke off her breast, burying his face in it as he climbs on top of her. Naomi laughs uncontrollably as the limo glides to a stop. The door opens from outside -- the Doorman? 
TERESA (O.S.) Get out of the fucking car. 
Jordan looks up, locks eyes with Teresa. He jumps off Naomi, stumbles out, closing the door behind himself.

The limo takes off.    Teresa starts crying... 
JORDAN I thought you were at the beach house, I-- 
TERESA I married you when you had nothing-- 
JORDAN Teresa... I don't know what to say. 
TERESA You're like a totally different person. 
JORDAN I'm not. I'm sorry.        I made a mistake, okay? 
TERESA Tell me you don't love her. 
JORDAN I... 
TERESA (off his silence) Jordan? 
Jordan says nothing.       Finally, Teresa starts sobbing. 
JORDAN (V.O.) I felt horrible. 
Jordan holds her, letting her cry. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

JORDAN (V.O.) Say what you will, but the Duchess did have style. She brought in a decorator, feng shui'd the place-- she even hired a gay butler. 
NICHOLAS THE BUTLER, 40s, enters with hot towels on a silver tray. 
JORDAN Thank you, Nicholas. 
Jordan takes a towel, wipes his face.      Naomi smiles.

JORDAN I just want my stuff back, okay? 
NICHOLAS THE BUTLER I didn't take anything.

Jordan turns, then crosses to them, smiling. 
AUNT EMMA Jordan dear, how lovely. 
JORDAN It's so nice to see you again.

JORDAN You're an aspiring landscape architect?! But what happened to wine connoisseur? Oh wait, that was last month!

Naomi winds up with the water glass. Jordan stands tall, puffs himself up, arms flexed at his sides. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) Stop flexing your arms, you look like a fucking imbecile. (re: his crotch) And don't think that impresses me much. 
Jordan looks down: he has a morning erection. 
JORDAN I wasn't flexing my arms. You're just lucky to have a husband who's in such great shape. Now get over here and kiss me! 
NAOMI Kiss you?!

Jordan enters the tiny pink wonderland. On the fluffy pink carpet is Naomi, now in a minidress hiked above her hips, Manolo Blahniks showing polished red toes. Between her legs sits SKYLAR, their 5-month-old daughter. 
JORDAN Hey, Skylar. 
NAOMI (little girl voice) Good morning Daddy. Where's my kiss? 
Jordan kisses the baby, picks her up. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
JORDAN (playing along) Does Daddy get to kiss both his girls? 
NAOMI Ohhh, no! Daddy doesn't even get to touch Mommy for a very, very long time. 
Naomi lays back on her elbows, thighs parted - she's wearing no panties. The wind goes out of Jordan. 
JORDAN C'mon, Nay, please. You know how sorry I am. I swear I-- 
NAOMI (cutting him off) Daddy shouldn't waste his time. And from now on it's going to be nothing but short, short skirts around the house! And Mommy's so sick and tired of wearing panties, uhhh. In fact she's decided to throw them all away. (parting her thighs) So take a good look. You'll be seeing an awful lot of it around the house, but no touching. 
She licks her lips seductively.     Jordan sets Skylar aside, starts grovelling. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) What's wrong, Daddy? 
Naomi slips her index finger in her mouth, starts sucking it. Jordan can barely speak. 
JORDAN C'mon, why are you doing this? I said I'm sorry. 
NAOMI (pouting) Ohhhh poor, poor Dada. He loves to say how wrong he is when he's ready to come in his own pants. Isn't that right Dada? Mommy loves Daddy so, so much and there's nothing she wants to do more right now than to make love to Daddy all day long. Well, I guess it's time for Daddy to be taught his first lesson. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages     3/5/13 
Naomi runs her fingers over her stomach and on to her inner thigh, then up toward her vagina. Jordan watches transfixed, then a change comes over him... 
JORDAN I wouldn't do that if I were you Mommy. I think Mommy should hear a story before she decides to please herself like that. Can Daddy tell Mommy a story? (off her nod) And does mommy promise to keep her legs spread wide, wide open the whole time? (she nods dreamily) Good. Once upon a time there was a great big mansion in Long Island and the people who lived there had lots and lots of money. But of all the possessions they had, there was one thing that was much more valuable than all the rest combined, and that was their little baby daughter. 
Naomi listens, legs still spread, hand on her crotch. 
JORDAN (CONT'D) Now because he was very security- conscious, the Daddy hired two full-time guards, big hairy men both named Rocco, and they installed security cameras all around the house. And one of those cameras is right over Daddy's shoulder. 
Naomi's eyes widen -- she look toward a Teddy Bear on a shelf. WE SEE that one of the eyes is a pinhole camera. 
JORDAN (CONT'D) So smile, Mommy! You're on Candid Camera!

STEVE MADDEN (CONT'D) For those of you who don't know me, my name is Steve Madden. I'm -- 
ONE BROKER We know who you are! The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
Steve clears his throat, looks over at Jordan -- he's terrified. Jordan motions for him to calm down. 
STEVE MADDEN I uh, I'd like to start by telling you about my background in the shoe industry. 
ANOTHER BROKER Nice fucking hat! 
STEVE MADDEN I uh... first started working in the shoe industry, in a shoe store. When I was sixteen, my friends were out chasing girls, but I was learning about women's shoes. 
KALIL                        PETER DEBLASIO Move the mike closer.             We can't fucking hear you! 
He moves the mic; feedback SCREECHES through the bullpen. 
STEVE MADDEN (CONT'D) Sorry... Anyway, my first job was at a shoe store like I said where I worked in the stockroom. You know, I can honestly say I've been a lover of women's shoes since I was twelve-- 
BROKER #4 Freak! 
STEVE MADDEN No. Heh-heh. Not like that. I mean somehow I became fascinated with the endless design possibilities for women's shoes-- 
BROKER #5                        BROKER #6 Queer!                            Get a fucking life! 
Boos, hisses. Steve looks at Jordan, who motions for him to speed up. He grabs a shoe from one of the boxes. 
STEVE MADDEN (CONT'D) This shoe --    the Mary Lou -- is the one that    really put me on the map. It's a     black patent leather variation of    the Mary Jane, but-- 
SPLAT! A half-eaten grapefruit lands at Steve's feet. In a flash, Jordan rushes over, grabs the mic-- The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13 
JORDAN All right, let's hear it for Steve Madden and the wonderful Mary Lou! 
Huge applause, with stomping feet; howling, etc. 
JORDAN (CONT'D) Okay, now that you got that out of your system, I want you to know why Steve is so completely off the fucking wall... It's because this man is a creative genius. Steve's power, his gift -- is that he creates trends. Artists like Steve come along once a century! Elvis! Andy Warhol!    Giorgio Armani! Who knows how high this stock could go? The 20s? The 50s? The 80s? 
Applause; war whoops.      Jordan motions for quiet. 
JORDAN (CONT'D) I want everybody to look down. See that little black box in front of you? It's called a telephone. Now I'm gonna let you in on a little secret about this telephone -- it won't dial itself! That's right -- until you take some action, it's nothing more than a worthless hunk of plastic, like a loaded M16 without a trained Marine to pull the trigger. And in the case of the telephone, it's the action of you, a highly trained Strattonite, a killer who will not take no for an answer!   A person who will not hang up the phone until his client either buys or fucking dies! 
The Brokers go crazy.      Jordan looks around. 
JORDAN (CONT'D) I don't care if you graduated from Harvard or Bumfuck University or never got past fourth fucking grade! That phone is the great equalizer! (pause; looks around) There is no nobility in poverty. I've been rich, and I've been poor and I choose rich every time. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 JORDAN (CONT'D) At least as a rich man, when I have to face my problems, I show up in the back of a limo wearing a $2000 suit and $40,000 gold watch! 
Jordan takes off his GOLD WATCH, flings it to the Crowd. Brokers go nuts, fighting over it like a home-run ball. 
JORDAN (CONT'D) And if anyone here thinks I'm crazy, get the fuck out and get a job at McDonald's, because that's where you fucking belong! But before you depart this room full of winners, I want you to take a good look at the person next to you, because one day in the not-so- distant future, you'll be sitting at a red light in your beat-up old Pinto, and that person's gonna pull up in a brand new Porsche, with their gorgeous young wife at their side. And who will you be next to? Some ugly beast with three days of razor-stubble in a sleeveless moo-moo, crammed in next to you with a carload of groceries from the fucking Price Club! 
He scans the Brokers; they're on the edge of their seats. 
JORDAN (CONT'D) So you listen to me and listen carefully. Are you behind on your credit card bills? Good. Pick up the phone and start dialing. Is your landlord threatening to evict you? Good. Pick up the phone and start dialing. Does your girlfriend think you're a fucking loser? Pick up the phone and start fucking dialing! I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich! I want you to go out and spend money! Leverage yourself, back yourself into a corner, let the consequences of failure become so fucking unthinkable that you'll have no choice but to do whatever it takes to win! 
The Brokers go absolutely APESHIT. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
JORDAN (CONT'D) You have an obligation here, people! To your clients! To this firm! An obligation to yourself, godammit! You ram Steve Madden stock down your clients' throats and make them choke on it till they buy 20,000 shares! Be aggressive! Be ferocious! Be telephone fucking terrorists!! 
Before Jordan is even finished, the Brokers GO BERSERK, some already dialing their phones. 
JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) At 1 p.m. we opened the stock for sale at $4.50 a share. By 1:03 it was over eighteen dollars.

And as we continue PANNING the room... 
JORDAN (V.O.) Of course I couldn't have done this without help. I'd leaked the word on Wall Street that Stratton was a buyer up until twenty. So not only were we pushing Madden, all the big firms were too. 
We continue PANNING the frenzied Brokers... The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

Donnie pours champagne nearby, oblivious to Jordan, who sits at his desk, speaking directly to camera: 
JORDAN Of the two million shares being offered for sale, a million belonged to me, held in phony accounts by my ratholes. Once the price hit the high teens, I-- 
Jordan abruptly stops.     A beat, then: 
JORDAN (CONT'D) Like I said before, who gives a shit? As always, the point is this-- 
BACK TO SCENE -- Donnie hands Jordan a glass of Dom. 
JORDAN I mean, one like this. Just had her extended to put a chopper on the back. 
Jordan points out the Bell-Jet helicopter. 
AGENT DENHAM Never been on a boat with a second mode of transportation on top of it. 
Jordan finds the file he's been looking for, offers it. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
AGENT DENHAM (CONT'D) (before he'll accept) What is this? 
JORDAN Names and addresses of every guest at my wedding. Friends, clients. I even threw in the seating chart. Heard that's why you wanted the video, figured this'd expedite whatever it is you're doing. (Denham looks: it's indeed a guest list from the wedding) I wanted to show you I've got nothing to hide. I know you're investigating Stratton but for the life of me I can't figure out why. Sure, my company is unorthodox; what brokerage isn't? Maybe we're a little louder than most but we don't do anything illegal. Talk to the SEC, they'll tell you, they checked us out up and down. 
AGENT DENHAM The SEC's actually a civil regulatory agency. We pursue criminal activity. 
JORDAN That's what I'm saying. You guys take on real crime. Which is why I'm so curious: what do you think we did? 
The reason Jordan asked him here, Denham realizes. 
AGENT DENHAM I can't discuss ongoing investigations. 
JORDAN I understand. 
AGENT DENHAM Though, to be frank, this case kinda got dumped on my desk. Some higher-up felt your shop needed looking into after all that press, fell on me to do the looking. 
JORDAN You know who you should be looking at? Goldman, Lehman Brothers, Merrill. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 JORDAN (CONT'D) What those guys're up to with collateralized debt obligations? This internet stock bullshit? C'mon. If you want, I'll walk you through exactly -- 
AGENT DENHAM -- that'd be great. And if there's anything you can give me just to close out your file, get it off my desk-- 
JORDAN -- sure, get you back to the real criminals -- 
AGENT DENHAM -- then we could both profit from this little sit-down. 
Jordan sizes him up: what did Denham mean by "profit"? 
JORDAN You sure you don't want anything to drink? Water for your pal? (Denham demurs) Rumor is your started out in finance. Even got your broker's license before you joined the bureau. 
AGENT DENHAM Who told you that? 
JORDAN (searches his memory) Jeez, who was it...? (comes up short) Ever regret it? Giving up the money-crazed, pin-striped life? Ever think where you'd be if you'd stuck with it? 
AGENT DENHAM When I'm riding the subway home, sweating my balls off, in a suit I've worn three days, sure. 
JORDAN Whattaya pull in working at the bureau, if you don't mind me asking. 50-60K a year? 
AGENT DENHAM Just about. We get a free handgun out of it, though, that doesn't suck. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
JORDAN S'crazy, the world we live in, the jobs with real value, the ones we should appreciate -- firefighters, teachers, FBI agents -- those are the ones we pay the least. 
AGENT DENHAM Way of the world. 
JORDAN That's one thing I like about what I do, the opportunity to make that right. Take this kid we had interning last year. Didn't want to be a broker, wanted to be an environmental scientist or something, he had a student loan debts up to his eyeballs. Anyway, his mom gets sick, all they can afford is third-rate care. Some of us got together, made an investment on his behalf and -- boom -- overnight everything changes, she's seeing the best doctors in the country. Sadly, didn't work out, she passed but still: having the power to do that makes all the other bullshit worth while. (as Denham considers that) See, it's all about proper guidance, Pat. Knowing someone with the right relationships, who's discreet. I can change a life almost every day. 
They measure each other. 
AGENT DENHAM How much that intern make off your deal? 
JORDAN North of half a million. 
Denham summons Agent Hughes over. To Jordan: 
AGENT DENHAM Can you say that again, what you told me? (Jordan declines with a smile; to Agent Hughes) I believe Mr. Belfort just tried to bribe a federal officer. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
JORDAN What? I was making conversation. 
AGENT DENHAM Sounds like that to me, Jordan. 
JORDAN ...no, no, no... 
AGENT DENHAM ...sounded like that... 
JORDAN ...no, to constitute a bribe, don't I have to make an explicit offer of money for services? With an exact dollar figure attached? All I said was "north" of half a million. According to the U.S. Criminal Code, that dog won't hunt, Pat. (then) Heard you were a straight arrow. That you wouldn't bend the rules other agents might. He was right. 
AGENT DENHAM You did a background check on me? 
JORDAN Figured you were looking into me, was only fair. Plus you sail on a yacht fit for a Bond villain, sometimes you gotta act the part. 
AGENT DENHAM This is why you invited me down to your yacht? With a couple hookers on it -- 
JORDAN -- those are friends -- 
AGENT DENHAM -- to get a sense of the guy who was coming after you? 
Jordan puts his hands up: "you got me." 
JORDAN Thanks for coming down. Now get off my boat. 
AGENT DENHAM You know, most of the Wall Street jackasses I bust, they were born to the life. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13 AGENT DENHAM (CONT'D) Their father was a douchebag before them, and his father before that. But you, you got this way all on your own. Good for you, Jordan. (as he starts to go) Thank you for having us. I'm absolutely certain we'll see each other again. (before he does) You know, this is about the nicest boat I've ever been on. Just think what a hero I'll be in the office when the bureau seizes it. 
Jordan watches him go, temper flaring: he can't let Denham get the final word. He calls after them: 
JORDAN Hey, Denham! I'm gonna eat a claw of lobster now as I get my cock sucked by Heidi down below. You have a super ride home on the subway thinking about that!                          * 
As he watches them pull away, seething -- 
JORDAN (V.O.) He was a numbers guy, a follow-the- fucking-money'er. He wasn't gonna come at me through my guys, looking for a weak link and a quick kill. He was gonna come at me like an accountant would, the way Ness got Capone, through my books. Which meant? It was ass- covering time. 
SAUREL Jordan Belfort! At last! Nicholas has told me so much. 
RUGRAT Jordan, Jean-Jacques Saurel. 
JORDAN Nice to make your acquaintance. This is some lobby you got. 
SAUREL Ah, yes. We gave our designer an unlimited budget and he exceeded it. Come! You must tell me all about your adventure with the stewardess over coffee! 
They disappear upstairs.

151   INT. BANQUE REAL DE GENEVE - SAUREL'S OFFICE - DAY               151 
Jordan, Rugrat and Donnie drink coffee with Saurel and one other SWISS BANKER. It's an impressive office, with          * an enormous fish tank. 
DONNIE We have a joke in America. "Heaven is a place where the police are Brits, the chefs are Italian, the car mechanics are German, the prostitutes are French and the bankers are Swiss." I never got it `til now -- look at those fucking fish! Come here, little guy... 
SAUREL Yes, we have the same joke here. Only sometimes the English are chauffeurs and the chefs are French. The Germans, alas, are always mechanics; no one wants to grant them more authority than that. 
Polite laughter. Jordan, not as impressed by the fish, cuts straight to the point: 
JORDAN I'm curious about your bank secrecy laws. 
SAUREL Excusez-moi, Jordan, Swiss custom requires ten minutes of idle chit- chat before business can be discussed. (a smile) Of course, let's get "down to it." What would you like to know? 
JORDAN Under what circumstances would you be obligated to cooperate with an FBI or U.S. Justice Department investigation? 
SAUREL Ca depend. 
JORDAN Ca depend?      Ca depend on what? The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
SAUREL Whether America plans to invade Switzerland in the coming months. 
RUGRAT Want me to see if tanks are rolling down the Rue de la Croix? 
More chuckles.   Through Jordan's forced smile: 
JORDAN (V.O.) What I'm asking, you Swiss dick, is are you going to fuck me over. 
SAUREL (V.O.) I understand perfectly, you American shitheel. 
Saurel smiles. 
SAUREL The only way the Banque Real de Geneve would cooperate with a foreign legal body is if the crime being pursued also happened to be a crime in Switzerland. But there are very few Swiss laws pertaining to your "rumored" improprieties. Which is why Mr. Azoff's joke is most appropriate: from a financial standpoint you are now in heaven, and we welcome you. If the U.S. Justice Department or FBI or SEC or IRS sent us a subpoena, it would become papier-toillette. We would wipe our ass with it. 
Everyone's impressed.      Except Jordan. 
JORDAN Unless it was an investigation into stock fraud -- which is a crime in Switzerland. Then you'd have to cooperate. 
SAUREL (now he's impressed) Yes, we would. Assuming the account is under your name. However, if it were in the name of a nominee of yours... 
They take each other in. The Wolf of Wall Street     Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
JORDAN (V.O.) Was that yodeling I just heard or did you just say what I thought you said? 
SAUREL (V.O.) Yes!   Yes! 
As the meeting wraps up with handshakes, Jordan's V.O. overwhelms Saurel's V.O.. 
JORDAN (V.O.) He was telling me to use a rathole. Problem was: sneaking a U.S. rathole into Switzerland was a chance I couldn't take. What I needed was somebody with a European passport.

AUNT EMMA So tell me about this plan of yours. 
JORDAN I'd like us to go to Switzerland tomorrow so you can open an account. I'll fund it, and I'll pay you really well for your trouble. 
AUNT EMMA Oh my. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13 
JORDAN Next month maybe you can fly to New York and we can start moving the cash. 
AUNT EMMA Moving the cash. (smiles) I feel like a character in an Ian Fleming novel. It's all quite racy, isn't it? 
JORDAN It is, and it's illegal too. Of course if you ever got in trouble, I'd come forward in two seconds, say I duped you, but even still. 
AUNT EMMA Risk is what keeps us young, isn't it darling? 
JORDAN I like that attitude. Promise me                      * you'll spend at least ten thousand pounds per month out of the account, okay? 
AUNT EMMA (chuckles) I wouldn't even know how. I really do have everything I need. 
JORDAN But I bet you don't have everything you want. How about a bigger apartment so your grandkids can sleep over? 
BRAD I dunno, not much. Fuck, they'd probably do it just for the miles. 
DONNIE What about my money? The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

DONNIE My money. I got a few mil of my own I wanna move. I'll call you, you can come pick it up.

Jordan can't respond. Phone still to his ear, his eyelids droop. Drool spills from his slackened jaw. 
JORDAN (V.O.) After fifteen years in storage, the Lemmons had developed a delayed fuse. 
JORDAN'S POV -- is hazy as he stares at his own reflection in the pay phone. 
JORDAN (V.O.) It took 90 minutes for the little fuckers to kick in, but once they did -- pow! I had skipped the tingle phase and went straight to the drool phase. 
JORDAN'S POV -- the phone gets further and further away. 
JORDAN (V.O.) Actually I'd discovered a new phase: the cerebral palsy phase. 
BAMMM!! Jordan hits the floor with a thud, crashed out on his back. From the dangling phone, we hear: 
BO DIETL (O.S.) (over phone) Jordan! Jordan! Do not get behind the wheel! Just tell me where you're at, I'll send Rocco! 
Jordan lolls his head toward the phone, tries to reach for it; he can't. He lays there for a while, then: 
JORDAN (V.O.) C'mon, stand up! 
He rolls onto all fours, lifts a hand, topples over. 
JORDAN (V.O.) Okay, walking is off the list of options. All right, what else is there? (a brainstorm) I can crawl, like Skylar! 
Slowly, Jordan begins crawling like an infant to the top of the staircase.

The Lamborghini is parked at the bottom, twenty steps down. He starts to crawl down the stairs, stops. Tries again. Can't figure out how to do it. 
JORDAN (V.O.) Fuck!   The kid makes it look so easy! 
An icy wind blows through his T-shirt. 
JORDAN (V.O.) -- this seemed the most civilized way to transport it overseas. 
ON ANOTHER BAG, this one brimming with bottles of pills, bags of pot, vials of coke. Jordan and Donnie cut up lines as a HOSTESS serves Bloody Marys. 
HOSTESS Can I get you anything else, gentlemen? 
JORDAN I have a rare condition that requires me to drink one of these every fifteen minutes. If you could set your egg timer, I'd appreciate it. 
She goes. The blow is ready for inhaling. Jordan and Donnie are doing a "you first, no, you first" routine with a rolled up $100 when a CELL rings. Donnie grabs it.

JORDAN (no time for it) Thanks but where does this leave us in regard to her account? It goes into probate or what? 
SAUREL Not to worry, Jordan. Your aunt, before she died, signed a document naming you as her successor. 
JORDAN She did?! 
SAUREL (a sly grin) Well. Not as of yet. 
And as they continue talking, Jordan pulls out a nautical map of the Italian coastline:

DONNIE (CONT'D) You know, we're all behind you. Everyone at the office. (he removes an envelope, hands it to Jordan) We bought back your mortgage. All the founding partners threw in a million apiece. Figured none of us would have it if it weren't for you. 
Jordan's profoundly touched. Donnie squeezes his shoulder. A real moment of friendship. 
DONNIE (CONT'D) You gotta fight this thing, baby. 
Jordan nods.

Jordan sits alone, finishes writing a long list of names on a yellow legal pad. 
JORDAN (V.O.) For the next six hours, I came up with a list. Friends, enemies, business associates, anybody who'd ever known me or taken so much as a stock tip. The first name on the list was Donnie's. 
And as Jordan heaves a huge sigh, we're suddenly...

Wearing a suit and tie, Jordan walks in to the bullpen, where the Brokers spot him, giving him a standing ovation. He forces a smile, waves to the crowd. 
As Robbie and Chester Ming look on, Jordan forces a smile as he approaches Donnie, who gives him a hug. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

Jordan and Donnie sit at the coffee table over takeout sushi. 
JORDAN The trial won't be for months, so obviously I'll be counting on you to pick up the slack. 
DONNIE Whatever you need, bro.     You know that. 
Jordan reaches in his jacket for a yellow slip of PAPER. 
JORDAN And you know how much that means to me. Hey, you know what I wanted to ask you? 
Jordan catches Donnie's eye, pushes the PAPER over in front of him. 
JORDAN (CONT'D) The Steve Madden deal, did he ever come through on that? 
Donnie looks down at the paper, reads Jordan's writing: 
"DON'T INCRIMINATE YOURSELF.      I'M WEARING A WIRE." 
JORDAN (CONT'D) Remember he was supposed to kick back like four mil from that one account? 
DONNIE Uh... tell you the truth I was so fucked up, I don't really remember anything about that. 
Donnie slips the paper in his jacket, gives Jordan a look -- "Thank you." Jordan nods. 
JORDAN Well if you talk to him, let me know. You want the last yellowtail? 
DONNIE Why not? 
JORDAN (V.O.) And thus began my career as a government cooperator. I was a rat... The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

Jordan lays alone, asleep in bed.      We hear the DOORBELL. 
JORDAN (V.O.) But I wasn't losing any sleep over it. 
After a few beats, Violet knocks, enters.      Jordan stirs. 
VIOLET I'm sorry, Mr. Jordan.     You got a visitor.

AGENT DENHAM I need you to get dressed. 
JORDAN Why?   What's going on? 
AGENT DENHAM You're going to jail. 
Agent Denham holds up the slip of yellow paper that Jordan gave to Donnie. And on Jordan's look... 
JORDAN (V.O.) Donnie Azoff, my partner. My best friend.

JUDGE DREDD 
FADE IN: 
BLACK SCREEN. 
NARRATOR In the third millennium, the world... changed. 
1 MONTAGE (STOCK - IF DESIRED) 1 Vicious events, both natural and man-made. Earthquakes. Floods. Ice storms. War. Riots. Chaos and injustice. 
NARRATOR(CONT'D) Climate. Nations. Borders. All were in upheaval. Humanity itself turned as violent as the planet. Civilization threatened to collapse. And then... a solution was found. The crumbling, teetering legal system was merged with the overburdened police, creating a powerful and efficient hybrid. Trained equally in jurisprudence and combat, these new guardians (X) of Society could dispense both justice and punishment. They were (X) police, jury and executioner, all in one. They were... The Judges.

5 EXT. WASTELAND - DAY 5 
It looks like the beginning of time... or its end. Nothing grows here. Nothing could. This is the CURSED EARTH. With a WHIRR, a SHUTTLE appears in the sky. We PAN it to a GIANT CITY WALL. A LOCK-LIKE GATE chugs open. The shuttle ENTERS. 
6 INT. CITY LOCK - DAY 6 
As the massive craft settles, it is sprayed down by HI-POWERED JETS. Brown dirt drips away to show eroding metal and the LOGO: 
"MEGA-CITY JUDGE SYSTEM - ASPEN PRISON SHUTTLE #3." 
P.A. SYSTEM 
ASPEN PRISON SHUTTLE DOCKED. (X) 
PAROLEES, PREPARE TO DISEMBARK. (X) The shuttle's air lock port whooses OPEN. A line of drably (X) dressed men and women exit, carrying their few possessions. (X) 
JUDGE DREDD 2 Rev. #1: 16/4/94 
7 THE CITY LOCK - INNER GATE TO CITY - DAY 7 One by one the parolees return to society. We follow the last: HERMAN FERGUSON ("FERGIE"). Fergie's a.genius - a genius without common sense, street smarts, or muscle tone. So his career as a master criminal has gone absolutely nowhere. 
GATE GUARD 
(SCANNING HIM) Ferguson, Herman. Six month sentence Aspen Prison served. Welcome back, Citizen. Your living _ assignment is Block Y, "Heavenly Haven", Red Quad. Watch it or (X) your ass will be back in Aspen. (X) Fergie hurries through the gate. We follow him - as he stops in his tracks. He's looking at 
8 A MAGNIFICENT CITY 8 Giant towers reach miles into the sky. Elevated skyways are filled with traffic. Flying Barges and Shuttles service the highest levels. Dominating all is a building shaped like an EAGLE: The Hall of Justice. Almost lost and forgotten among' (X) the towering buildings is a relic from our time: The Statue of (X) Liberty. Title Supered: (X) 
MEGA-CITY ONE: 2539 (X) Fergie takes another look at the gleaming city, and then his (X) papers. (X) 
FERGIE (X) Heavenly Haven. Sounds nice. 
CUT TO: 
9 EXT. HEAVENLY HAVEN BLOCK - DAY 9 
And it is nice - a perfect Utopian future of happy families strolling through a green urban park. CAMERA WIDENS... and we realize that the scene is a, "video poster" on a bleak and rubble-filled EMPTY LOT..Z

10 NEW ANGLE - THE EMPTY LOT 10 A MUNICIPAL VEHICLE pulls up. A bored CITY TECH gets out, goes to the Video Poster Standee and turns it OFF in mid-ilspe. The sudden silence attracts some attention. The TECH drops in a NEW VIDEO CART which begins to PLAY as he drives away. Rezzies gather around to watch the new video.

FIRST RESIDENT Our Park! They stole our park! 
SECOND RESIDENT Lying bastards! 
HERSHEY Take cover! 
26 WIDER 26 As bullets seek them out, both riders dive off their bikes and roll into combat positions behind a low wall. Hershey's partner BRISCO is young and eager... too eager. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BRISCO 
(BEHIND BARRICADE) Just like an Academy Simulation, right down to the crossfire. 
(RISING) I'll lead off, you follow. 
HERSHEY (yanking him back) This isn't a Sim, Rookie! Stand down and wait for back up! (into helmet mike) In position outside Heavenly Haven. Pinned down by fire from upper floors. 
CUT TO: 
27 EXT. VIEW OVER MEGA - NIGHT 27 
A figure close to CAMERA straddles an even bigger LAWMASTER CYCLE that makes a Harley look like a mo-ped. The rider's GLOVED HAND activates the Lawmaster's CITY MAP. 
HERSHEY(V.O.) Fire is coming from Level Y, repeat Y. Request back-up, nearest Judge! The map BEEPS, shows a route. The hand moves to the THROTTLE. 
2E LAWMASTER - WIDER 28 -DA,RS away from the CAMERA, burning rubber. 
CUT TO: 
29 EXT. STREET - BLOCK WAR - NIGHT 29 
Hershey and Brisco are pinned down under a barrage of fire. Smoke fills the street, the sounds of automatic weapons fire, exploding glass, and screams, fill the air. Hershey tries to ae: a shot off - a bullet CRACKS her face plate - 
CUT TO: 
3C THAT ONCOMING LAWMASTER 30 Whips around a corner - dodges a burned out vehicle. The mighty bike VAULTS the barricades and lands. A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL sails in front of it,, EXPLODES. The rider'does a WHEELIE! 
UP ANGLE The bike parts the flames like a curtain, SMASHES DOWN right in the middle of all the chaos. The Rider gets off. 
32 HERSHEY AND BRISCO 
huddle behind their bikes at the perimeter. They react to a figure emerging from the smoke. 
BRISCO That's our back-up? He's a sitting duck out there. You'd think he wants them to see him. Hershey smiles ruefully. 
HERSHEY If that's who I think it is... he does. 
33 THE FIGURE 
Steps out of the flames. Six feet of armored justice, he was raised in a State Orphanage that taught him Duty and Honor. Now, he serves that State as Judge... Jury... and Executioner. ::is BADGE fills the frame: "DREDD". 
CUT TO: 
34 _N':. SQUATTER'S LEVEL - NIGHT 
Tw:st stares down, scared. 
TWIST Fuck. That's Judge Dredd. We gotta surrender while we can-- He starts to raise his gun over his head. Zed smacks him in the yaw with his own weapon. 
ZED You chickenshit bowab! He's gonna surrender to us. And then we'll blow his brains out. (shouting). Come and get us, Dredd! Zed FIRES out the window. Reggie happily joins, then the others. Finally Twist shrugs, FIRES too. 
REGGIE' More ammo! A terrified Fergie hands him a clip. 
,5 EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT 
The stream of GUNFIRE chews up the pavement at Dredd's feet. 
HERSHEY Down! You crazy futz - ! 
36 DREDD 36 strides calmly over to them. 
DREDD He's firing a 64 laze pumper from six hundred feet. He couldn't hit me if I painted a bull's eye on my ass. 
(GLANCING UP) We'll keep it simple. Standard relay. Single file. I'm point. Hershey nods. Brisco, eager to prove himself, steps in front of Dredd at the Heavenly Block entrance. 
DREDD(CONT'D) You - last. Dredd pushes Brisco behind Hershey. Turns toward Heavenly as re draws his massive LAWGIVER HANDGUN. Dredd speaks into the ::ny computer in the breech as he aims at the door. 
DREDD(CONT'D) Grenade. :'ï¿½BccM! The round knocks the steel door off its hinges. Dredd r:zxs :z aside and the Judges enter. 
TWIST 
(SEEING IT) Lawgiver! Awesome! And he snatches it up, and aims at Dredd's head! 
49 WIDER 49 
ZED 
(SHOUTING) Don't touch it! They're booby trapped - ! Too late. A high pitched BEEP is the only warning before the Handgun EXPLODES, knocking Zed off his feet. 
C NEW ANGLE 50 Zed starts to get up - sees Twist's ARM on his body! Screaming, flings it aside and jumps up - right into Dredd's KICK. 
DREDD Mega-City Municipal Code 334.8. Willful destruction of property. That's two years. WHAR:. He hits Zed in the face. Zed rocks, but stays up. He fries tc grab a nearby weapon, but Dredd kicks it away. 
DREDD(CONT'D) Code 11-5C. Illegal possession of assault weapons. Five years. Zed blocks Dredd's next blow; pulls him into a brutal embrace, slams Dredd against the walf. Again! 
DREDD(CONT'D) Code 7034-A. Resisting arrest. Twenty years. Dredd breaks free! Slams Zed once, twice. Zed flies back against the wall. 
FAVORING ZED 
DREDD(CONT'D) 9804. Assault on a Judge with deadly intent. 
ZED (tough, scornful) Don't tell me. Life. CAMERA REVEALS that Zed another weapon hidden behind his back. Now, he goes for it! 
52 FAVORING DREDD 52 We weren't expecting Zed's move. Dredd was. While we were blinking, he kicked a fallen weapon up from the floor and caught 
DREDD No... Death. He FIRES at the same moment as Zed! Zed's shot hits Dredd's ARMOR, pings off. Dredd's shot hits Zed's heart. 
DREDD(CONT'D) Court is adjourned.

HERSHEY I was supposed to watch out for him. 
DREDD He made the mistake. Not you. Dredd cocks his head, listening. Somehow in the din and confusion he has heard something. He turns. 
:5 NEW ANGLE 55 The food robot is coming down the corridor, skittering around bodies and debris. Its actions are less smooth than before, and its voice seems off, too. 
(CONTINUED) 
55 CONTINUED: 55 
FOOD ROBOT Ummm, umm, yumm! Healthful and nutritious food rations, ready to eat! Dredd suddenly pushes forward in the crowd. Hershey follows. She watches, puzzled, as he steps in the automaton's path, takes an assault rifle from another Judge and AIMS it! 
DREDD 
(TO ROBOT) Halt! You have ten seconds to surrender. Ten. Nine. 
HERSHEY 
(PUZZLED) Dredd, It's just a servo-droid - 
DREDD (aside to Hershey) The guide wire in the floor isn't working. (to the robot) Five! Four! 
FOOD ROBOT Ah, just put your credit in your selection and - credit in the slot and-and - shit! The robot stops. The jumble of food in back spills out and Fergie uncoils from the cramped interior, still holding the scarK r.a wires he was using to manipulate the machine. 
DREDD Mega-City Municipal Code 1286.4: Willful sabotage of a public servo-droid. That's six months, citizen. He grabs Fergie, pushes him against the wall. 
DREDD(CONT'D) (taking it)- Let's see your Unicard. 
FERGIE Come on, give me a break, Judge uh-. 
(SEEING NAMETAG) D-dredd? By now Dredd has run his scanner over Fergie's chip and Fergie's dossier is zipping by. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 2) 
DREDD FERGUSON, Herman. Forget six months: You've hacked into city droids, computers... (reading, interested) Cash machines, robot taxis... And you haven't even been out of jail for twenty four hours. 
(TO HERSHEY) He's habitual, Hershey. Automatic (X) five year sentence. 
FERGIE Five years? But - I - I had no choice, judge - He sees Dredd's impassive face, turns to Hershey's more sympathetic one. 
FERGIE(CONT'D) They were killing each other up there, I had to get out! I only hacked the droid to save my life! It was the only way! 
(LEAVING) I pray you're right, Dredd. 
WITH DREDD 
S Ch As Griffin leaves, Dredd turns. As he passes the Council (X) amber, Fargo beckons to him. Startled, Dredd joins him. (X) 
DREDD (X) Chief Justice? 
(X) 
FARGO Four Summary Executions, Dredd. (X) Were they necessary? 
(X) 
DREDD (X) They were unavoidable, sir. Out (X) there... that's the reality. (X) 
FARGO 
W (X) e make our own reality, Dredd. (X) Maybe it ' s time for a new one. (X) Although I doubt Judge Griffin would (X) recognize a new reality if he (X) arrested it himself. 
(X) 
DREDD With all due respect, sir, how can you say that when you spend most of your time - D edd breaks off; he's said too much. But Fargo won't let him she hook. 
FARGO Most of my time where? 
DREDD At the Academy... Sir. 
FARGO Don't you mean at the Academy wiping Cadet's Asses? That is what they say in the squad room, isn't it? 
DREDD It.. doesn't matter what they say, Sir. You're the.Chief Justice of Mega City. If rt weren't for you and the others like you, we wouldn't have our justice system. There isn't a Judge in Mega-City who doesn't want to follow in your footsteps. 
(CONTINUED) 
7 CONTINUED: 57 
FARGO I'm glad you feel that way, Dredd. Because starting tomorrow you're going to spend one day a week at the Academy... teaching. Dredd takes this in his stride. 
DR,EDD I'd be honored. Unarmed combat, or marksmanship? 
FARGO (exiting, with a grin) Ethics. And as Dredd reacts, we

Dredd glares at the embarrassed technicians. 
DREDD(CONT'D) Yours... if they ever get it to work. LAUGHTER. Dredd moves to a lectern. Faces the class. 
DREDD(CONT'D) All of these things are nothing (X) but toys. Bottom line, final word, (X) end of the day, when you're alone in the dark... all that counts... is this. takes something from the lectern shelf, throws it down. It's all-but holy book: THE LAW.

HERSHEY Well, I think your truth is relative. I have a personal life. I have lots-of friends. 
DREDD Really. How long since you saw any of them? 
HERSHEY 
(DEFENSIVE) Well, my shifts have been changed a lot lately. Two, three months, (X) tops. 
DREDD You've only been on the street a year. You're still in denial. 
LILY Vardis, if you're right, then this Judge Dredd isn't really part of the conspiracy.

The wreck burning behind him, Dredd head back towards his bike... suddenly STOPS. He sees TWO FIGURES in front of him. And, the moment he does, he knows without. looking that there are two identical ones behind him. They're garbed for combat, yet without even the trace of humanity that seeps through a Street Judge's armor. These are the feared JUDGE HUNTERS. All have drawn weapons. The LEADER holds up a HOLO WARRANT with Dredd's PICTURE.

HERSHEY Stop video. Do you hear it? When Lily Hammond says "Dredd", it's (X) part of the conversation. And when Vardis Hammond,,sa s 'Dredd' it (X) could just as easily be the same.

Griffin bangs the gavel for silence.

DREDD Judge Hershey. I'm really glad I picked you to defend me.

1C- TR:AL 103 
HERSHEY Cadet Olmeyer is acknowledged by (X) all his instructors to be an expert in the field of still and video graphics. His affidavit states that this surveillance video is of such low definition that even after all known enhancements are used, no positive identification can be made of the killer. Since the uniform of a Judge could be counterfeit, I repeat my objection to this video being entered as evidence in this case. (turning to Griffin) I ask for a ruling.

Under a fading SUNSET we SEE the forbidden land beyond: THE CURSED EARTH. We TIGHTEN on Fargo, grizzled, weary; the girl, fresh, tearful. Like so many, she reveres this man and what he represents.

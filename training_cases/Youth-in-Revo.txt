SAILOR #1 So he owes us nine hundred dollars. 
NICK Well, I think he used that nine hundred dollars to buy his Lincoln. He's giving my mom a joyride in it now. But he'll be back this afternoon, so I would come back then. He's pretty stubborn. You might have to beat it out of him. 
SAILOR #1 That can be arranged. In the meantime we're leaving the piece of shit in the driveway. With a note. Nick looks one more time to the Chevy as the third sailor finishes painting the hood with the words: PAY UP OR DIE. 
NICK I like it. Very to the point. Well... See you guys this afternoon! The sailors nod, somewhat perplexed by this kid's demeanor. As they turn to go and Nick closes the door... 
LEFTY (V.O.) I might have to kill myself. 
EXT. HILLS ABOVE UC CAMPUS - DAY 
In the clearing, a UC JOCK stands behind his ASIAN GIRLFRIEND, kissing her neck and removing her clothes. 
NICK (V.O.) I hope you have a good reason. Reveal Nick and his friend LEFTY, 16, belly down in the grass overlooking the clearing. Lefty watches the copulating couple with a pair of binoculars. 
LEFTY My sister said she saw Millie Filbert holding hands with some college guy. 
NICK I dunno, Lefty. I think your sister is just waging psychological warfare. 
LEFTY Well it's working. What am I gonna do, Nick? I'm obsessed. I think about Millie so much my balls ache. 
NICK Maybe your just not wacking off enough. As if in response, Lefty passes the binoculars off to Nick and then turns over onto his back and unzips his pants. As Lefty jerks it, Nick looks with nonchalance... 
THROUGH THE BINOCULARS The couple hump in the grass, her legs in the air. 
LEFTY (O.S.) So, I've been taping my pecker to my right leg at night. 
NICK (V.O.) In case you haven't heard, Lefty's erect member takes a dramatic turn midway up the shaft. 
LEFTY (O.S.) Then I look at this issue of Better Homes and Gardens that has a girl that looks just like Millie until it gets good and hard. I think it's starting to straighten out. 
NICK Why don't you just have your parents take you to the dick doctor? 
LEFTY (O.S.) Are you kidding? It would kill them to know that I even get hard-ons. 
NICK Still, you might want to get it fixed before asking Millie out. 
LEFTY (O.S.) True. What if I shove it up the wrong hole? Nick gives a dubious glance in Lefty's direction. 
NICK (V.O.) Lefty's grasp of the female anatomy is somewhat tenuous; he imagines there are orifices galore down there. 
INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY 
JERRY Nick, you little shit, get down here! Jerry hollers from the kitchen where Estelle gapes out the window. Nick calmly joins them from upstairs. 
ESTELLE Nick, do you know anything about this? She points out the window and they all take in the Chevy and the sailors' oh-so-subtle note on the hood. 
NICK Oh, yeah. Those sailors came by. They want their money back. I guess there was a banana in the transmission. 
JERRY You tell them when I was coming back? 
NICK Now why would I do that? Jerry seeths inwardly at Nick's mock innocence. 
ESTELLE What are you going to do, Jerry? 
JERRY I think I'll go get the Lincoln washed. 
ESTELLE You're leaving? What happens when the sailor comes back for his nine- hundred dollars? 
JERRY Just tell him he bought the car with my standard guarantee. Thirty days or thirty feet. Whichever comes first. I'm in the right. And on cue comes the ring of the doorbell and the simultaneous pounding of angry Navy fists on the back door. They peer out the window and find the fleet on the front steps. 
NICK Oh, look. The sailors are here. Jerry first starts to dart one way and then another, searching for a hiding space as he hisses. 
JERRY Get rid of them! And then the front door gets kicked open and a mob of sailors pour in. Jerry flees. A HANDHELD CAM chase as he heads for the back and is cut off by the sailors coming in. Jerry bolts up the stairs. 
NICK Jerry, where are you going? Just tell them you are in the right. 
INT. ESTELLE'S HOME - CONTINUOUS 
They manage to grab Jerry by the legs and haul him down the stairs. Jerry loses his grasp step by step, crying with a sound not unlike E.T. when the flashlight hit him in the cornfield. The two big guys with bad haircuts hold Jerry off the ground while the earnstwhile Chevy owner goes through his pockets. 
SAILOR #1 Sixty-three lousy dollars. 
JERRY That's my life savings! One of the sailors pokes Jerry in the gut hard and he whimpers. 
INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY 
Nick sleeps on a pull out cot. He bolts upright at the banging, his hair going in all directions. 
MRS. SAUNDERS (O.S.) It's your neighbor, Mrs. Saunders. Church services begin at seven fifteen prompt. Donuts will be served. Nick glances down at the morning wood elevating his boxers. Mrs. Saunders narrows her eyes at Nick through the screen door and takes off. 
EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY 
Nick steps out of the trailer in a bathrobe, toiletries in one hand, towel in the other. He heads off down the wooded path. 
EXT. WOODS - DAY 
The serene melodies of rousing HYMNS float from the well- attended congregation in the meeting hall. WE TRACK across the trees as Nick makes his way down the path. He slows to observe the sun coming through the canopy overhead. He glances off the path and comes to a sudden stop. A grape arbor flanked by Corinthian columns set against the blue of Clear Lake. A chestnut haired SHEENI SAUNDERS stands facing the water, her head tilted down to read the book in her hands. The wind coming off the lake blows her dress just enough to give a hint of the shapely thighs underneath. 
Light falls in shafts through the latticework of the arbor like something out of a Fran√ßois Boucher painting. 
NICK (V.O.) The moment I see her I know the Gods, while having cruelly endowed me with imperfect posture and pussy postponing pimples, had put me here for a purpose. My heart palpitates. My mind races. I get an instant 
T.E. Super:                (Thundering Erection) Sheeni glances up from her book and looks over her shoulder at him. Nick just stares. She gives an amused smile, almost flirtatious. Nick grins back. 
SHEENI Your robe is open. Nick looks down. He pulls the robe closed, scowls, and goes into a flustered march down the path. 
INT. PUBLIC REST ROOM - DAY 
An austere   cement shed with three dripping shower heads and no privacy   walls. Nick lathers up under the spray. Jerry appears in   the foreground and removes his robe. He goes to the shower   head next to Nick and turns it on. Nick reacts to Jerry and hastily tries to resume rinsing himself off. Jerry gurgles water and spits. He starts warbling rock lyrics. 
EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY 
Nick comes up the path and stops short at the picket fence. Estelle and Sheeni squat on the patio steps. 
SHEENI Hel-lo, Excitable Boy. 
ESTELLE Nick, honey, meet Sheeni Saunders. 
NICK Hello. 
ESTELLE Sheeni needs to go to the grocery store. I've offered her your help in carrying her bags. Nick regards Sheeni and her mischievous smirk. 
NICK Thanks a pantsful. 
EXT. RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY 
A dusty road. Nick totes a watermelon and a paper bag. He watches as Sheeni works on a Popsicle. Full lips that cry out to be kissed. 
NICK You don't have to go to services? 
SHEENI No. Much to the consternation of my fanatical parents I have converted to atheism. Fortunately my brother, Paul, paved the way for such transgressions. 
NICK Paul is an atheist too? 
SHEENI Buddhist, I believe, though we have not seen him in some time. I myself am looking forward to being free of parental bondage. 
NICK Likewise. 
SHEENI Well, your mother seems very nice, though your father I think might be rather dim. 
NICK Jerry and I share no blood links of any kind. As they pass the meeting hall there comes a surge of HYMNS in chorus. 
NICK Sounds rather zealous. 
SHEENI Yes, even though I am no longer a believer I always found the services wonderfully aerobic. 
NICK You could say the same thing about sex. Sheeni stops. She looks at Nick intently. 
SHEENI Nick, are you going to turn out like all the other young men and have nothing on your mind except carnal pleasures? 
NICK I hardly ever think about sex. 
SHEENI Really? I think about it all the time. It's the hormones at work, you know. She resumes walking. Nick follows her with confusion. 
EXT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY 
They regard the two story Pacemaker mobile home. 
NICK Wow. A second floor. 
NICK Please do. She takes a dramatic pause. 
SHEENI RamDam 12/ Sizzle mop/ Crunch down/ Safety net/ Hot! Hot! Hot!/ Void. She gives a slightly amused smile at Nick's blank expression. 
NICK (V.O.) If that's poetry, I'm a turkey scrotum. 
INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT 
TIME LAPSE of Nick thrashing about in bed. During this montage there is the constant ticking of a clock. 
NICK (V.O.) Here is an hour by hour account of the worst night of my life. Nick flipping through a Penthouse under the covers. 
NICK (V.O.) 1 AM. I decide it is just a case of puppy love and look forward to the interesting women I shall meet in the future. 
EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT 
A light comes on in the window. 
INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY 
Nick at the dining table, writing a note. 
NICK (V.O.) 2 AM. I conclude the only way out is suicide. I begin to pen a poignant suicide note. Sheeni will see Trent for the shallow pedant he is and always treasure my memory. 
JERRY (O.S.) Turn off the damn light! 
EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT 
Nick paces about back and forth in the yard. 
NICK (V.O.) 3 AM. I decide I am too chicken for any of the manly, violent means of suicide. I shall swallow sleeping pills. Where to get them, though? 
INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT 
Nick is in bed jerking off. The trailer shakes despite his best efforts. 
NICK (V.O.) 4 AM. I can not die an inviolate virgin. Either I find a way to get laid soon or suicide gets postponed until after high school. 
JERRY (O.S.) You wanna beat your meat, go outside! 
INT. PUBLIC REST ROOM - DAY 
Nick in the shower going to town on his T.E. 
NICK (V.O.) 5 AM. It will be too painful to see Sheeni again. I shall ask Mom if we can cut our vacation short and return to Oakland. 
INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY 
Nick rolls over on the cot and looks up with the gaze of a manic insomniac. 
NICK (V.O.) 6 AM. Violent panic! I have to see Sheeni again! 
INT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY 
The door opens to reveal Nick standing outside in shorts, an I'M SINGLE, LET'S MINGLE shirt, and tennis shoes. Sheeni stands in the door. Sleep-fogged eyes. 
NICK Good morning! 
SHEENI Nick? God what time is it? 
NICK Seven o'clock. How about breakfast? 
SHEENI (smiling with endearment) Come back in two hours. I'm going on a hike. You can join me if you'd like. She closes the door. 
Super:     One hour fifty seven minutes later A knock on the door. Sheeni opens it to reveal... Nick, dressed the same. Sheeni wears Khakis, red bandanna neckerchief, and an Australian bush hat. She looks like the world's most desirable Girl Scout. She examines Nick's attire. 
SHEENI Nick, where are your hiking boots, water bottle, provisions, survey maps and compass? 
NICK Like John Muir I enter the wilderness with nothing more than my journal and a childlike sense of wonder. 
SHEENI Okay, but I have no plans to baby any slackers. 
EXT. WOODS - DAY 
Sheeni leads the way up hill. Nick clutches his cramped stomach with one hand, his journal in the other. He watches the rhythmic movements of her ass through her hiking shorts. 
ESTELLE Jerry! Jerry chuckles. Nick stares at him, perhaps resolving to murder the trucker in his sleep. 
INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - LATER 
Nick lies below us on the cot, unable to sleep with the anticipation of the imminent loss of his virginity. 
EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT/DAY 
Another perfect California summer dawn, a pale moon lingering in the blue morning sky. Nick emerges from My Green Haven in his robe. He starts off down the path. 
EXT. WOODS - DAY 
The trailer park is relatively silent save for birds and the distant sound of dogs barking. 
EXT. PUBLIC REST ROOM - DAY 
Nick approaches the shower building. As he nears, the sound of water running can be heard from the ladies' side. 
INT. PUBLIC REST ROOM (WOMEN'S SIDE) - DAY 
The women's side has real stalls and privacy doors. Nick spots the chamber at the end where Sheeni's naked form showers, obscured by tacky stained glass. He kicks off his slippers. Hangs his robe on a hook. He approaches the stall. Flashing super:       Thundering Erection He opens the shower door and steps into the steamy spray. He embraces her. Pendulous breasts, sagging skin, a patch of white hair under a drooping belly, wrinkles... It's Mrs. Saunders! She looks up startled. Nick lets out a horrible woman-like scream. Mrs. Saunders starts screaming too, the sound of a pig being slaughtered. She hurls a bar of soap. The bar strikes Nick upside the head and he loses his footing on the slippery tile. He goes down, taking Mrs. Saunders with him. They wrangle in the mist as Nick tries to escape. 
MRS. SAUNDERS 
RAPE! RAAAAAPE! Suddenly the door opens. It's Sheeni in her robe. She reaches out and pulls Nick up. 
SHEENI Get out quick! Still wearing her robe, she dives into the spray to save her mother. Nick grabs his robe and retreats. 
INT. CAFE - DAY 
Nick slouches in a corner of the shop, his hands trembling as he brings his coffee to his lips. He hears the door open and looks up, but instead of the cops finds Sheeni. She joins him at the table. 
NICK Should I go to the sheriff's now? 
SHEENI No. I managed to convince Mother you were retarded and couldn't read the sign. 
Nick nods thankfully. 
NICK Say, where were you anyway?   We said five minutes to six. 
SHEENI I'm sorry. But, Nick, women are always discreetly late. It's expected of us. 
NICK Swell. And the punctual guy fries in the chair for rape. 
SHEENI Don't complain. At least you got to shower with a naked woman. (licking donut powder off her fingers) What are your plans today? 
NICK My parents want to go to Middletown. Jerry has the moronic notion of buying a trailer there before we leave. 
SHEENI I should like to come with you, Nick. The more time we spend together the better. I fear when you leave we might never see each other again. Nick nods glumly. Clearly a devastating thought. 
INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY 
Sheeni's in back with Nick, but doesn't seem to mind the wind tunnel. She has a scarf tied around her chestnut locks. Nick looks down as she casually rests a hand on the inside of his thigh. As they round a curve at 60, she yanks Nick's sunglasses off and tosses them over her shoulder into the lake. 
EXT. GEEZER'S MANOR - DAY 
Estelle, Jerry, Nick, and a toothless old GEEZER whose gut rivals Jerry's, all stare at a rusty RV that looks like it might not make the trip back. In the background, Sheeni pets a goat in the dusty yard. 
JERRY What's your cash price? 
GEEZER I said in the ad. Thousand dollars firm. 
JERRY Thousand, huh? That must be with a guarantee. 
GEEZER As is, where she is. 
JERRY I don't know. Those rusty propane tanks are a fire hazard. The roof probably needs work. I couldn't go above eight hundred. The geezer ponders the bad news. Estelle shakes her head and goes inside the RV to inspect. 
ESTELLE (O.S.) There are mouse droppings in all the closets, Jerry. 
GEEZER I might take nine fifty. 
JERRY Nine hundred. Sheeni lets out a squeal of delight. They all turn their attention to where she has discovered a box full of squirming 
PUPPIES. She brings one of them over. 
NICK How about I have a quick vasectomy just to be on the safe side? 
SHEENI (matter of fact) Well, Nick, that, of course, is up to you. 
Nick looks displeased that his sarcasm didn't register. 
EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY 
Jerry hitches the trailer to the back of the Lincoln. Estelle loads up the trunk. 
ESTELLE Nick, honey, say goodbye to Sheeni. It's time to hit the road. Nick watches Sheeni kiss Albert. He looks less than enthused at the thought of sloppy-seconds. Finally Sheeni hands Nick the dog. Nick and Sheeni stand there an awkward beat. Sheeni leans in and gives him a peck on the cheek. 
SHEENI (whispering in his ear) Don't forget, darling. Red wine and Consumer Reports. She smiles. They're the sexiest words Nick's ever heard. He grabs her and kisses her deeply. Jerry HONKS the horn and they break off. 
INT. LINCOLN - DAY 
Nick gets into the back seat with Albert. The dog whimpers. Sheeni stands off to the side, waving at them both. 
JERRY Okay. Back to civilization! He fires up the Lincoln and they kick up dust. Albert slobbers all over Nick. Nick sets him down and watches Sheeni in the side-mirror, waving in the road. 
NICK (V.O.) I have a tall mountain to climb, with many treacherous glaciers still to cross, but finally, I have obtained a stamped entry visa to the paradise that lay beyond. Sheeni watches the Lincoln and trailer recede toward the horizon. 
NICK (V.O.) In short... I have a very real prospect for getting laid. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY 
The Lincoln and RV slow to a stop outside the home. 
I/E. LINCOLN - DAY They all stare at the empty space where the Chevy-Nova used to be. Jerry gets a smirk of satisfaction. 
JERRY You see that, Babe. They caved. 
EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY 
Jerry backs the RV into the drive as Nick helps his mother with her belongings and they enter the house. The RV scrapes its way through a few overhanging tree branches before Jerry decides it's parked. There comes a woman's scream from inside the house. 
INT. ESTELLE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Jerry joins Nick and Estelle in the doorway. There in the living room, surrounded by all the furniture pushed neatly against the walls, is Jerry's camouflaged Chevy. 
NICK I guess they didn't cave after all. Jerry pops the hood and lets out a whistle. 
JERRY Boy, everything's complete. There's even water in the windshield washer. 
ESTELLE How did they ever get it in here? My front door can't be more than three feet wide. 
JERRY Looks like they brought it in piece by piece and then reassembled it. 
ESTELLE But it would take an army of mechanics to do all that! Jerry slams down the hood. 
JERRY Or a navy, Babe. Or a navy. 
EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY 
A cab pulls up in front of the house and Nick's sister, Joanie gets out of the back. She tips the driver, and as she crosses the front yard, gawks at the RV sitting in the drive. 
INT. ESTELLE'S HOME - HALLWAY - DAY 
Nick's door is ajar. Nick pulls up his trousers and comes into the hall. He listens to the voices downstairs. 
STAIRS - CONTINUOUS He comes down the first few steps and is met with the sight of his mother and sister staring up at him. 
ESTELLE Nick, your sister came all the way from LA for a weekend visit! Nick and Joanie meet eyes. She lifts a quizzical eyebrow. 
NICK Stellar. 
INT. ESTELLE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
Albert chews on Jerry's sock under the table. 
JERRY Can someone do something about the mutt? The family dines over take-out fried chicken. Jerry kicks Albert and the puppy goes tumbling across the floor. 
ESTELLE I don't know, Jerry. Can someone do something about the monstrosity dripping oil in my living room? 
NICK And how is Trent? Not too suicidal I hope. 
INT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY 
Sheeni relaxes on a love seat, cradling the phone with her shoulder as she eats grapes from a bowl. WE INTERCUT. 
SHEENI Of course, he was disconsolate, but we talked all day and he's come to see this as an opportunity for growth. Oh, and Nick, Trent wanted me to tell you that he bears you no ill will. 
NICK Nor I him. I wish him all the best. 
SHEENI His parents are sending him to a French speaking boarding school this year. He's sure to get along there. So how is my darling Albert? 
NICK Well, though he's taken a disliking to Jerry. 
SHEENI And you, Nickie? How are you? 
NICK I regret, Love of My Life, my father has lost his job and I will now be forced to go to public school. 
SHEENI How unfortunate. What did he do? 
NICK He's a writer - sort of. He writes advertising copy. 
SHEENI Really? (pensive beat) Nick, I suggest we look at your father's firing as a blessing in disguise. 
NICK How so? 
SHEENI I propose we get your father a job here in Ukiah and you can come and live with him. 
NICK Brilliant. Not that I'm fond of Ukiah, but I'd live in a drainage culvert to be with you. 
SHEENI Oh, Nickie. Now, I happen to know Progressive Plywood is looking for an assistant editor. It would be perfect for your father. Nick furrows his brow with skepticism. 
NICK I had no idea you had knowledge of the employment opportunities of trade magazines. 
SHEENI The owner is the father of a friend of mine. 
NICK Anyone I know? 
SHEENI Okay, it's Trent's father. So what? 
NICK So why would Trent want to help my father move to Ukiah? 
SHEENI I told you, darling. Trent harbors you no ill will. I will have him call your father up pretending to be a head hunter. 
NICK Very well, but I don't see how I am to live with him. My mother values my indentured servitude. 
SHEENI You must influence her to send you away. I feel this will require being in a constant state of open revolt on your part. 
NICK What do you want me to do? 
SHEENI I propose you rent the film Rebel Without a Cause as soon as possible. You must emulate James Dean... CLOSE ON her GLOSSY LIPS. 
SHEENI ...You must be bad, Nickie. Be very, very bad. A glint of resolve in Nick's eyes. 
NICK I will, darling. I will! And in pre-lap comes the DING DONG of the doorbell. 
INT. ESTELLE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Joanie and Nick sit in the Chevy Nova watching Rebel Without a Cause through the windshield. 
Estelle enters the living room with tears streaming down her face and a police officer, LANCE WESCOTT, 45, with a flattop, watery red eyes, and assorted guns, flashlights, and billy clubs. 
ESTELLE Kids? This is Officer Lance Wescott. He has some bad news. After a beat, Nick rolls down the window. 
LANCE Your mother's friend Jerry had a heart attack in a bar in Dallas. He's dead. Estelle sobs, but isn't joined by her children. She turns to Lance. 
ESTELLE Will they be sending his belongings? 
LANCE Uh... I'm afraid they've already been sent. To his wife. Beat. Nick looks to Joanie. They both look to their mother. 
ESTELLE His... His wife?!? She bursts into tears and collapses into Officer Lance Wescott's arms. 
LANCE There, there, Ma'am. It's going to be okay. Nick watches his mother sobbing against the cop's chest for a beat before he rolls up the window and he and Joanie resume watching the movie. Estelle's cries of despair become... 
INT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT 
EXT. OAKLAND - DAY 
Nick walks Albert down the sidewalk. Lefty crosses the street to him and they walk together. 
NICK Hey, Lefty. How's it hangin'? 
LEFTY You'll never believe who called me, Nick. Millie Filbert! 
NICK What?!? Why? 
LEFTY I dunno. She just called and asked if I wanted to hang out tonight. I didn't want to ask why. I need to find someplace for us to get it on. Albert squats to poop in someone's yard. The boys pause to wait for him. 
NICK You can use my house if you want. 
LEFTY Really? 
NICK Sure. My Mom and Lance are going to a movie and I'm planning on stealing Jerry's trailer and torching it in a parking lot, so you'll have the whole house to yourself. 
LEFTY Right on. Albert finishes his business and they resume walking. 
NICK So where you headed anyway? 
LEFTY Dr. Browerly's office. My parents are making me see a shrink now. 
NICK He asking lots of weird questions? 
LEFTY You bet your left nut he is! He asked if I had any lustful thoughts toward my sister. 
NICK What did you tell him? 
LEFTY I told him about beating off once with her brassiere. 
NICK What did you tell him that for? 
LEFTY You don't know what it's like. I think they release chemicals in their office to make you tell the truth. 
NICK Sounds like a professional. He must be very expensive. 
LEFTY I wouldn't know. The bill goes to your house. 
NICK My mom is paying for your therapy? 
LEFTY I guess so. It was your cyclops I was staring at. 
NICK Yes, but it was your idea. 
LEFTY That's true. Gee, maybe I am gay. 
NICK Don't be retarded. We were doing research for our girlfriends. 
LEFTY Oh, right. I forgot. That's a relief. So you'll leave the door open? 
NICK Yeah, just don't blow your load on my sheets. 
LEFTY Thanks a pantsful, Nick. 
NICK Don't mention it. See ya, Lefty. 
INT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY 
Nick hunches over his desk doing homework, headphones over his ears. Estelle knocks and enters. Nick pulls the headphones down around his neck. 
ESTELLE Lance and I are walking down to the movie theater. There's TV dinners in the freezer. Oh, and Nick - your father got a job in Ukiah. 
NICK Mom? Do you think it might be a good idea if I moved in with him? 
ESTELLE Nick, that just wouldn't work. I depend on that child support money to eat. 
NICK But shouldn't you depend on the child support money for, you know... child support? 
ESTELLE Watch your smart mouth. She slams the door. 
EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY 
NICK (V.O.) The plan is simple. Nick places two full cannisters of gasoline into the trunk of the Lincoln. Nick's behind the wheel, backing up the car. 
We find Nick waiting in the drive with a pile of suitcases beside him. 
LEFTY (O.S.) Psst. Nick. Nick finds Lefty lurking in the shrubs that divide his mother's lawn from the neighbor's. He limps to his friend. 
NICK I was wondering what happened to you. Did you get to blow your wad? 
LEFTY No. I did not get to blow my wad. 
NICK Did you get interrupted? 
LEFTY No. Worse. 
NICK What's worse than being interrupted? 
LEFTY Millie is a lesbian. 
NICK 
WHAT?!? 
LEFTY The only reason she wanted to hang out with me is because she heard that I showed you my slinky and thought I was gay too. 
NICK Sorry, man. I didn't have a great night either. 
LEFTY Well, I dunno what you're gonna do, but I'm giving suicide serious consideration this time. 
NICK Or you could just fake it and then hide out in Ukiah with me. Then later come back and maybe Millie Filbert will boink you out of pity. 
LEFTY Hey, that's not a bad idea. Thanks a pantsful, Nick. A pair of headlights swing into the drive and Lefty ducks out of sight. The headlights turn out to belong to George Twisp's 
BMW. The driver's side window rolls down to reveal Nick's dad. Lacey leans over George's seat to wave at Nick through the window and show him some of her cleavage. 
LACEY Hiya, Nick! 
NICK Hi, Lacey. Hi, Dad. The trunk pops open. 
NICK Is there any way I could sit up front with Lacey, Dad? Mom's boyfriend beat me pretty badly. 
GEORGE Sorry, Nick. In this car, faggots get the back seat. 
I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - NIGHT Nick is in the back, crowded in by his belongings and Albert. They ride in tense silence until they pass the sight of the fire, where FIRE FIGHTERS sift through the ash. 
GEORGE My God. Look what you've done. Lacey turns to look at Nick over the seat. They share a smile. 
EXT. UKIAH - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
Morning peers over the distant hills. 
INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY 
The BMW pulls into the drive of the house - a plywood rectangle perched on cement blocks. Aluminum windows. A swamp cooler on the shallow-pitched roof. They all emerge from the car. 
GEORGE Go ahead and bring your stuff inside. Lacey and I need a nap. C'mon, Sugar Puss. Nick watches longingly as George leads Lacey into the home. As he places his hand on Lacey's ass, he looks back over his shoulder and throws a smug look in Nick's direction. 
NICK (V.O.) What a competitive asshole. 
EXT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY 
Nick reaches the door and gently knocks. But it's Sheeni's ogre of a father who answers the door and stares at Nick sternly. 
NICK Uhm, hello. Is Sheeni available? 
MR. SAUNDERS She most certainly is not. As a matter of fact, we've banned you from her life, Nick Twisp. 
NICK Excuse me? 
MR. SAUNDERS Trent Preston informed us that not only were you moving here to pursue my daughter, but that you're not even mentally-handicapped, and thus molested my wife in the shower of sound mind and body. 
NICK That rat-fink-fuck! 
MR. SAUNDERS You watch your language. This is a Christian home. We're sending Sheeni to Les √âcole des Arts and Literatures in Santa Cruz. 
NICK Santa Cruz! But she'll be miserable without me. We're in love. The ogre snorts in condescending amusement. 
MR. SAUNDERS Then I guess it's a good thing Trent is going there too. She'll have someone to console her. And with that, Mr. Saunders slams the door so hard in Nick's face that the entire two story mobile home rocks back and forth. 
NICK Hello, Paul. How did you know my name? 
PAUL We've met. 
NICK No we haven't. 
PAUL In a previous life. 
NICK Oh. Paul begins rolling a joint. 
PAUL Nice fire in Berkeley. 
NICK Did Sheeni tell you that was me? 
PAUL She didn't have to. 
NICK Why? Was I an arsonist in a previous life? 
PAUL No. But Sheeni was. 
NICK My God. What did she burn? 
PAUL Men. Men and boys. Paul hands the joint out to Nick. He regards it dubiously. 
INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY 
An empty hallway. PSYCHEDELIC SOUND plays. Nick comes around the corner, literally floating down the hall. He breaststrokes through the air toward us. 
INT. GEORGE AND LACEY'S ROOM - DAY 
He passes just under the door frame and comes down, feet touching carpet. He looks into the mirror and finds Fran√ßois lounging on the bed behind him. 
NICK My God, Fran√ßois! What was Paul smoking? 
FRANCOIS Shut up and go with it. Nick shrugs and opens the top dresser drawer, revealing Lacey's lingerie. Nick starts dancing, doing a strip tease for himself. WE PAN AROUND the room, and when we reach Nick again, he's wearing nothing but a pair of Lacey's thongs. He models in front of the mirror, regarding his bulging T.E. He removes a C-cup bra and holds it high. He uses the elastic straps to fasten the bra onto his head. He starts dancing up a storm to the cheesy Vengaboys rendition of BRAZIL in his head. Waving arms. Bicycling leg movements. 
As he backs up we can see that George is watching him from the doorway, a Safeway bag in his arms. Lacey peers over his shoulder. The MUSIC halts abruptly. 
GEORGE What the... What the hell? Nick gives a startled jump. 
LACEY Is..? Is that my bra? 
INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - NIGHT 
Nick sits at the table, considerably more clothed and sober. George works on a jug of zin. 
GEORGE We're calling that fruitcake display strike one. Two more strikes and it's back to Oakland. Nick nods. The front door opens and MRS. CRAMPTON enters with Safeway bags of her own. Dwayne follows close behind her. 
DWAYNE Hey, Nick! Albert barks and jumps at Dwayne's feet. 
NICK Uh... Hi, Dwayne. What are you doing here? 
DWAYNE Ain't ya heard. We're gonna be roommates! Ain't that zinky? Nick looks to his father in horror as Dwayne goes chasing after the dog. 
MRS. CRAMPTON Dwayne, get yer dumb ass back here and take yer sleepin' pill. You must be Nick. Wash yer hands, boy. I don't serve two shifts. 
NICK Uh... Dad? What's going on? 
GEORGE Mrs. Crampton's our new housekeeper. I'm renting out the spare room to her seeing as her camper has been deemed unfit for human habitation. 
NICK What about Dwayne? 
GEORGE He's bunking with you. 
NICK Dad! 
GEORGE You working on strike two? Nick leans back and glares in silent protest as everyone takes their seats at the table. 
INT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Nick tries to shut out the sound of Dwayne getting into the creaky bed behind him. 
DWAYNE Say, Nick. You wanna sleep in bed with me? It'll be tons warmer. 
NICK No thank you, Dwayne. A knock at the door. Lacey enters. 
VIJAY So how is Sheeni? 
NICK I don't know. She sent me this letter. But it's in French. 
VIJAY Shall I translate it for you? 
NICK You speak French? 
VIJAY I speak French, English, Hindi, Marathi, and Urdu. 
LEFTY That must come in handy. Nick hands over the letter and Vijay starts reading it silently. He chuckles as he reads and Nick squints his eyes at him in annoyance. Vijay picks up on it, clears his throat and reads aloud. 
VIJAY Dear, Nick... 
INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - SUNSET 
In Nick's imagination, Sheeni puts pen to paper at her desk which affords a view of the sun setting on the ocean. 
SHEENI (V.O.) ...I am writing you from my room in Santa Cruz. Surprisingly, boarding school has proven to be a welcome liberation as well as... 
INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
SHEENI (V.O.) ...a stimulating experience which I am now not so quick to change. Sheeni slips into a nightgown as other GIRLS walk around scantily clad behind her. 
SHEENI Perhaps you should consider learning French and enrolling. That said... 
INT. √âCOLE DES ARTS ET LITT√âRATURE - HALLWAY - DAY 
Sheeni chats up a gathering of HANDSOME BOYS in the hall. They regard her lustfully. 
SHEENI (V.O.) ...English cannot be spoken on campus even if you are hemorrhaging from an accidental limb amputation. 
INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY 
SHEENI (V.O.) I have made friends with the head of the girls' basketball team. Her name is Heather, and despite her popularity, she is saving herself for college boys. HEATHER, a slender giantess, poses with the other members of the BASKETBALL TEAM for a yearbook photo. 
INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
SHEENI (V.O.) I have an interesting roommate from New York named Taggarty... TAGGARTY, short dark hair, intense green eyes, Manhattan sophistication cloaked in fragile ripeness, snaps a Polaroid of a sleepy BOY. 
SHEENI (V.O.) She has already slept with seventeen boys and hopes to rack up fifty before leaving here. Taggarty tacks the picture to a wall covered with Polaroids. She writes the boy's grade (C-) beneath his image. 
EXT. BEACH - DAY 
The distant figure on the windsurf board can only be Trent. 
SHEENI (V.O.) Trent has taken up windsurfing and has been designated target number one by all the girls. I am still very angry at him for the betrayal but he claims he wants to mend our friendship. The figure falls into the surf and the crowd of watching BIKINI-CLAD GIRLS gasp in horror. 
SHEENI (V.O.) I guess we shall see. 
INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 
VIJAY 
(READING) All in all, I'm happy and look forward to further growth in this rich, intellectual environment. Vijay sets down the letter. Nick waits a beat, staring in disbelief. 
NICK That's it? Nothing else about me? Vijay picks up the letter again. 
VIJAY Oh yes... Love to you and Albert. (setting down the letter) Who's Albert? 
NICK Albert is our dog. This is a disaster. What the hell does she mean Trent wants to mend the relationship? 
VIJAY I don't know, but this Taggarty girl sounds very uninhibited. I wonder if she's made it with a Hindu yet. 
LEFTY Heather sounds like a babe. You think if I grew a beard I'd pass for college age? 
NICK I've got to get to Sheeni as soon as possible. If I don't Trent Preston is going to mindfuck her into thinking she doesn't like me. 
LEFTY And then he'll probably fuck her in other ways. Did you know you're supposed to put your pinkie in a girl's bumhole, Vijay? 
NICK Will you shut up and help me out? 
LEFTY Sorry, Nick. What should we do? 
NICK I suggest we steal my father's BMW and take a trip to Santa Cruz. Vijay, you'll have to be our translator. 
INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
The two boys brush their pearlies over the grungy sink. 
VIJAY I am in a state of sexual frenzy. What is your plan? 
NICK We drape a blanket over the lower bunk for Sheeni and me. You tackle Taggarty on the top bunk. Here's a condom. I slipped two to Lefty, leaving us with four. 
VIJAY What if they don't go for it? 
NICK They'll go for it. You can cut the sexual tension in that room with a knife. 
INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
SHEENI Don't be silly, darling. Not with others in the room. (leaning in to whisper) We must wait until everyone falls asleep. Nick tries to appear unconcerned. She gives him a kiss and climbs into her narrow bed. As Nick and Vijay prepare their sleeping bags on the floor, they watch Taggarty climb up to her bunk in the sky. 
TAGGERTY Goodnight boys. Do you need the light on to take off your clothes? 
NICK No. (flipping off the light) We can find our zippers in the dark. 
A beat of BLACKNESS. Then a light tap at the door. There is the sound of Sheeni getting out of bed. She cracks the door, letting in just enough light from the hall that a MALE SHADOW gets cast across the two boys on the floor. Nick squints and tries to hear what Sheeni and the male shadow are whispering to each other. After a beat, Sheeni closes the door and the room plunges into BLACKNESS once again. Nick listens as Sheeni climbs back into bed as if nothing happened. 
NICK Sheeni? 
SHEENI Yes, Nick? 
NICK Was that the matron? 
SHEENI No. Beat. 
NICK Then who was it? 
SHEENI It was Trent. Beat. 
NICK Did you say it was Trent? 
SHEENI Yes. He came to discuss our friendship. I told him now was not the time. 
NICK So where is Trent now? 
SHEENI I assume he went back to the boys' dorm. Now really, Nickie, you are keeping everyone awake with your inquiries. Though silence follows, we take a moment to allow Nick's mind to race in the dark. He stands and looks at the mirror above the dresser. Fran√ßois can be made out sitting by the window in the moonlight, stroking the Thompson. 
FRAN√áOIS Now is our chance. 
NICK Chance for what? 
FRAN√áOIS To confront our nemesis. We must go to the boys' dorm and kill Trent where he sleeps. 
NICK I suppose we should at least get a look at him. To see what we're dealing with. 
FRAN√áOIS Very well. (stubbing out his 
CIGARETTE) You see what we are dealing with... and zen I wll deal wiz it. And with that he cocks the Thompson for dramatic flare. 
INT. GIRLS' DORM - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Nick emerges from the room in nothing but his underwear and a whindbreaker. He creeps down the hall. 
EXT. ECOLE DES ARTS ET LITTERATURE - GROUNDS - NIGHT 
The school SECURITY VAN crawls by in the background, a searchlight sweeping the grounds. The moment it is out of sight, Nick darts from the bushes of the girls' dorm and races across the campus to the boys' dorm. 
INT. BOYS DORM - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Nick makes his way down the hall, checking the names on the colored paper cut-out shapes that adorn the doors. He stops and backtracks when he spots the door that boasts the names TRENT and ED. Nick knocks on the door. It opens inward to reveal a bare-chested, hulking athlete in a pajama pants. This is ED SOLOMON. 
NICK Trent? 
ED No. Who the hell are you? 
NICK I am Nick Twisp. 
ED Oh, so you're Nick. 
NICK Is Trent here? 
INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
Nick enters the dark room to the sound of the bed squeaking. Vijay and Taggarty grunt away on the top bunk. He watches the moon lit forms thumping together. He turns his attention to the sleeping beauty on the bottom bunk. He moves toward her. She blinks, waking and smiles at the sight of him. 
NICK Sheeni? 
SHEENI Yes, darling. 
NICK Was Trent here? 
SHEENI Yes, Nick. Nick hangs his head. 
SHEENI But I sent him away again. Nick stares into her eyes to discern her honesty, but he finds nothing but adoration. 
SHEENI Because I want you, darling. Not even Trent can match the industriousness and tenacity with which you have pursued me. 
She smiles. Nick smiles too. She reaches out to pull him into her bed as... The door to the room slams open and they are suddenly backlit by the harsh beam of the matron's flashlight. 
MATRON Q'est que c'est passer ici?!? Nick bolts upright, smacking his head against the top bunk. He lands on the floor, where he gets a view of... Trent standing behind the matron. The blinding light makes his features difficult to make out but his white teeth are definitely smiling diabolically. 
EXT. GIRLS' DORM - NIGHT 
The boys come out of the front door of the dormitory, the matron, flanked by SCHOOL SECURITY GUARDS, hot on their heels. The girls in the dorm appear on the balcony in droves, cheering the boys' escape. Vijay's pants fall to his ankles, tripping him up. Nick and Lefty grab Vijay by the arms and pull him up again as if he were a wounded war buddy in a retreat from the Vietnamese Army. They reach the Beamer at the edge of the grounds. Nick gets in first. Lefty dives through the back window, legs kicking. Vijay slams the door just as the matron and her security team catches up to them. The authorities bang on the windows as Nick peels out. INDIAN POP blares from the car. They speed off into the night. 
I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - NIGHT Lefty lets out a holler of joy. 
LEFTY I did it three times! Two long ones and a quickie. 
NICK Great. Just great. How about you, Vijay? 
VIJAY It was difficult to tell with that condom, Nick. Why did you buy such thick ones? 
NICK That brand was top-rated by Consumers. 
VIJAY Well, she's safe. No organism could penetrate those walls. 
NICK You think the girls are in trouble? 
VIJAY They will likely notify their parents. Perhaps even expel them. 
NICK That's it! Expel them. Then Sheeni will have to come back to Ukiah. The car sputters. Nick's eyes go to the gas gauge. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 101 - RAINING - NIGHT 
The rain is coming down again. Nick shivers in his underwear. Vijay isn't in much more and Lefty's sheet is drenched. 
VIJAY What will we do? 
NICK Well, we can't stay in the car. Sooner or later Highway Patrol is going to come by and ask for our non-existent driver's license. 
LEFTY But we have no money! 
VIJAY I have no shoes! I'll catch pneumonia and die a indeterminate proto-quasi-virgin! 
EXT. HIGHWAY 101 - RAINING - NIGHT 
A couple coins are inserted into a roadside pay phone. There is ringing on the other end. 
ESTELLE (V.O.) Hello? 
NICK (into phone) Mom? It's Nick. I'm sorry to wake you, but I'm hoping you'll help your only son. Especially seeing as it would really piss off Dad. A long beat. 
ESTELLE (V.O.) Where are you, Nick? 
EXT. HIGHWAY 101 - RAINING - NIGHT 
The three boys are still standing in the rain by the pay phone. The three of them huddle under their only windbreaker. A pair of headlights appear in the rain. The headlights flash twice and Nick runs out into the road. 
POV TRUCK DRIVER Nick waving frantically in nothing but tightie-whities. The truck pulls to a stop and the passenger door opens to reveal, the driver, a man named WALLY RUMPKIN, a seven foot tall giant in a plaid shirt and bib overalls. He looks down at our three waylaid adventurers. 
WALLY Pardon me. But is one of you Nick Twisp? The two other boys exchange confused glances, not entirely if this is how people go missing. 
NICK Yeah. I'm Nick. 
WALLY I'm Wally. I'm a friend of your mom's. Nick nods, not yet sure whether or not this gentle giant is actually blushing with shyness or red with agitation at being sent on a midnight mission. 
NICK I'm sixteen, Dad. 
GEORGE Shut your pie hole! (turning to Lacey and 
PAUL) That boy is an underaged minor. I'm going to have you arrested and charged with child molesting. 
LACEY Don't be an idiot, George. No one was naked. 
GEORGE When you get out of prison, you will both have to register as sex offenders. You will never be able to get a decent job again. 
PAUL I've never had a decent job. I don't think I'd want one. 
LACEY Let's go, Paul. George, I'll pick up the rest of my things tomorrow. 
GEORGE Not until you pay me the rest of the money you owe. 
LACEY I paid you all your money! 
GEORGE Not the extra charges. She gets up in his face. 
LACEY Fuck-your-stinking-extra-charges. As Lacey and Paul depart, Nick turns and dreamily wanders back toward his room. 
GEORGE (O.S.) Using bad language in front of a minor. The judge will hear about that too. Nick gets back into his room and closes the door behind him. SWISH TO... Dwayne playing Nintendo naked. He looks over his shoulder. 
DWAYNE What's all the ruckus about? 
NICK Dwayne! Please cover yourself. 
DWAYNE You wanna play Nintendo all night? 
NICK Of course not. I'm tired. Let's go to sleep. Nick unplugs the Nintendo and climbs into bed. Dwayne just sits there on the floor, naked as a clam. 
INT. NICK'S ROOM - THE DEAD OF NIGHT 
NICK (V.O.) A strange night. I dreamed of wrestling for what seemed like hours with an amorous walrus... Nick squirms with an amorphous blob, they wrestle against the red abstract background. 
INT. NICK'S ROOM - MORNING 
Nick's bleary eyes snap open and wander to the floor, where his pajamas lie in a crumpled pile. 
NICK (V.O.) There is only one explanation: I have been Dwayned. A pillow whacks across a blubbery face. 
NICK Wake up! I know what you were doing last night, you disgusting beast! 
DWAYNE Don't be mad, Nick. I like you. Dwayne throws off his sheets. Nick shudders at the sight. ...which is when Mrs. Crampton barges in.. 
MRS. CRAMPTON Boys, time to get-- AHH! Dwayne! Where's yer pajamas? 
DWAYNE Nick made me take them off, Mom. He took off his too. 
MRS. CRAMPTON You leave my son alone. Don't go co'rupt him with yer nastiness! 
NICK We weren't doing anything, Mrs. Crampton. It was just hot last night. 
MRS. CRAMPTON If you get hot, boys, open a window. Don't go takin' off yer pajamas. That's nasty. 
INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY 
Nick dials on the phone. Behind him, Dwayne eats breakfast, cheerfully kicking his feet back and forth under the chair. 
TAGGARTY (V.O.) Bonjour. 
NICK Taggarty? It's Nick. 
INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - DAY 
Taggarty's at her desk. Her thick rimmed glasses almost make her look studious. WE INTERCUT. 
TAGGARTY Hey, Nick. I suppose you want to talk to Sheeni. 
NICK If you please. Taggarty crosses to the bunks, where Sheeni is curled up among the sheets as if in some Renaissance portrait. 
TAGGARTY It's your would-be-lover. Sheeni sleepily takes the phone. 
SHEENI Nick? 
A view of the thin birch walls. We come to rest on Nick, shivering under an electric blanket. There's a blob of snot on his upper-lip. 
NICK (V.O.) No matter. Tomorrow I will be reunited with My Everlasting Love. And I will not be stopped. Not by an outbreak of the plague, nor by a cruel return of the ice-age. Not even by the Gods themselves. 
EXT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY 
The velvet voices of the Rat Pack come from the home. Nick emerges from the Camper wrapped in the electric blanket. He scurries into the house. 
INT. BATHRROOM - DAY 
Nick showers. Nick straightens his Garcia tie in the mirror. He applies hair gel. Nick examines the whitehead on his brow. He pinches and a glob of puss smacks the mirror. 
INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - HALLWAY - DAY 
He emerges into the hall and dances with an invisible partner into the... 
LIVING ROOM where the phone RINGS. He flips off the stereo with the remote and snatches up the phone. 
NICK Twisp residence. 
ESTELLE (V.O.) Nick? 
NICK Oh. Hey, Mom. What's up? 
ESTELLE (V.O.) Nickie, I have some bad news! Nick sighs. 
NICK Okay. I'm ready. What is it? 
ESTELLE (V.O.) I'm afraid Lance and Wally got into a terrible row. He tried to arrest Wally and Wally broke Lance's jaw. 
NICK What's the bad news? 
ESTELLE (V.O.) The Berkeley police know you started the fire. Lance told them where you are. Nick glances up and sees the black and white patrol car pulling up outside. 
ESTELLE (V.O.) Nick, they're coming to arrest you! He slams down the phone. 
EXT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY 
The window slides open and Nick comes crawling out, leaping to the ground. He takes off running through the woods. 
EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY 
Nick pounds on the door. 
LEFTY (O.S.) Nick? Nick turns to find Lefty coming up the path with two bags of groceries under his arms. 
NICK Lefty, have you seen Vijay, today? 
LEFTY Nick, haven't you heard? Vijay's been arrested. 
NICK Arrested?!? 
LEFTY For grand theft auto. They found his prints in your father's car. 
NICK That's terrible. Did he go quietly? 
LEFTY No. He said you were his accomplice and now the Ukiah police are looking for you! We linger a beat on Nick's blank expression. Then - 
EXT. WOODS - DUSK 
We're off and running through the woods, trying to keep up with Nick as he flees. 
NICK (V.O.) The day has proven to be a disaster. Where did I gone wrong? I have a decision to make. 
EXT. COVERED BRIDGE - NIGHT 
The spotlight from the overhead helicopter sweeps over the bridge and continues down the road. 
NICK (V.O.) I could hit the road and spend my life a fugitive with my integrity nearly intact. 
UNDER THE BRIDGE Nick squats in the shadows. He's holding a bouquet of municipal flowers and dabs the sweat on his head with his tie. 
NICK (V.O.) It's that or risk incarceration to keep my dinner date. 
(BEAT) Obviously the answer is clear. 
They begin eating. A helicopter passes by outside, search light briefly coming through the windows. Nick watches Mr. Saunders take a handful of mashed potatoes and apply it to his face like war paint. 
MRS. SAUNDERS Paul? Your father looks rather strange. 
PAUL Well, mother, he is sitting in his own bowel movement. 
MRS. SAUNDERS That's no excuse. Another helicopter passes overhead. 
TAGGARTY The food is delicious, Paul. 
PAUL Thank you. 
(BEAT) Sister, darling, how long has it been since we all observed the rituals of Thanksgiving? 
SHEENI Not long enough, Paul. 
NICK I hope it's the first of many such occasions for me. Sheeni narrows her eyes at him. A long beat as they all dine in silence. Then- Mrs. Saunders croaks out in song. 
MRS. SAUNDERS Siiiilent night, Hooooly night/ Aaaall in calm, aaall is bright... Paul begins humming approvingly and one by one the others accompany her as Mr. Saunders pretends to conduct them with a drumstick. 
EVERYONE Round yon virgin Mother and Child/ Holy infant so tender and mild/ Sleep in heavenly peace... Sle-eep in heavenly pee-eace. 
And with that, the doorbell rings. Taggarty gets up and opens the door. 
TAGGARTY Oh, Trent, you made it. Nick glances up with a start as TRENT PRESTON makes his entrance. He's not quite the deity Nick's expected, but rather a fairly plain, blond with slightly androgenous features and a certain flamboyance. His black eye, courtesy of Ed Solomon, still remains. 
TRENT Hello, Taggarty. Hello, Everyone. Mr. Saunders grunts his acknowledgement as he takes the pitcher and pours water into his own lap. 
SHEENI Trent, darling, this is Nick. Trent swivels slowly around and they lock eyes. 
TRENT Nick, at last we meet. 
NICK Hello, Trent. 
TAGGARTY Have a seat, Trent. 
TRENT I'm sorry, Taggarty, I can't stay. I have bad news. 
SHEENI What is it? 
TRENT Bernice Lynch has tried to commit suicide. Sheeni and Taggarty gasp. Nick swallows hard. 
TRENT She swallowed a number of sleeping pills, and is now in a coma. 
SHEENI The poor girl. 
TRENT There's more. Before I left school, I searched her room. 
NICK Did you obtain proper authorization from the officials? 
TRENT No, Nick, I acted on my own initiative. In Bernice's closet, I found this letter. He dramatically extracts the letter from his pocket. 
TRENT In the letter, the writer instructed Bernice to begin sedating Sheeni with drugs he himself supplied. 
TAGGARTY Nick, you didn't! 
NICK Well, you see... 
SHEENI Nick! You could have killed me! 
MR. SAUNDERS Who died? 
TRENT No one yet, Mr. Saunders. Mrs. Saunders points a liver spotted finger in his direction. 
MRS. SAUNDERS 
ARREST HIM! 
TRENT I can't arrest him. But I have called the Santa Cruz Police. They are on their way here now. Nick places his napkin next to his plate and stands. 
NICK Well, I shall be going now. Please continue without me. 
TRENT Nick, I suggest you remain here and face the consequences like a man. Nick stops in front of Trent. 
NICK Thank you for that unsolicited counsel, Trent. And please, do drop dead. The other guests murmur their shock. Nick stops in the doorway. 
NICK Let me make it easy. I'll be at Redwood High School tomorrow morning. Round up your donut dipping friends. I'm turning myself in. Nick slams down the phone before Lance can respond. 
I/E. BUS (MOVING) - DAY Nick sits by the window, the suitcase on the seat next to him. 
EXT. UKIAH - DAY 
And the bus flies past the sign that says WELCOME TO UKIAH. 
EXT. UKIAH BUS STOP - NIGHT 
Nick steps off the bus and finds Lefty loading his belongings underneath. 
NICK Lefty? Lefty lifts his eyes and sees his friend. 
LEFTY Nick? What are you doing here? Everyone and their mother's mother is looking for you. 
NICK They have me soon enough. Where are you going? 
LEFTY Home. I'm done being dead, Nick. Heather and I are going back to Oakland for Christmas. You should have heard how glad my parents were that I didn't kill myself. They were even happier when they found out I'm not gay. 
NICK That's great, Lefty. 
LEFTY Yeah, being in love is pretty great. So what's your plan, Nick? 
Nick answers with only pensive silence. 
EXT. PAUL'S HIDEOUT ABOVE GARAGE - NIGHT 
Nick is about to knock on the door when Paul opens it in another display of clairvoyance. 
PAUL Welcome back, Nick. We had a feeling you were coming. 
INT. PAUL'S HIDEOUT ABOVE GARAGE - LATER 
Nick sits beside Paul and Lacey on the couch as they watch the infamous "chicken scene" in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. 
NICK (V.O.) Paul and Lacey are kind enough to share some leftover fungi to help calm my nerves. That, combined with yet another viewing of James Dean's performance is what gives me my final burst of inspiration. They all watch transfixed as JAMES DEAN leaps from his automobile just in time to escape demise. 
INT. PAUL'S HIDEOUT ABOVE GARAGE - LATER 
As the END CREDITS of REBEL play behind them, Lacey fits a bombshell wig on Nick's head and finishes the last touches of make-up that make him... ...who we will come to know as CARLOTTA ULANSKY. Nick regards his female alter-ego in the mirror. 
NICK (V.O.) Fran√ßois of course wants no part of this, and demands that we make a run for the border. But I have decided to veto him. It's time to face the music. 
INT. BMW 325I - DAY 
Nick turns the key in the ignition and CHRISTMAS MUSIC rises from the speakers. And the music plays over... 
EXT. REDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
...where a crowd begins to form in anticipation of Nick's arrival. Nick watches from behind a tree on the ridge. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. REDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - LATER 
...where police cars and news crews are pulling up to interview the students. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. REDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - LATER 
The parking lot is now filled with police cruisers and FBI vans, the news crews, REDWOOD HIGH STUDENTS, and an apparently CALIFORNIA WIDE NICK TWISP CULT FOLLOWING. TINA MANION, 17, speaks into a STUDENT NEWS CREW CAMERA. 
TINA This is Tina Manion reporting live at Redwood High in Ukiah where local law enforcement as well as the FBI awaits the promised arrival of Nick Twisp. There comes a murmur from the crowd and Tina directs the student camera-man to the road on the ridge where... George's BMW pulls to a stop overlooking the school. 
GEORGE Hey. That's my car! The crowd hushes as the door opens and Nick emerges. 
NICK'S POV of the parking lot below, which looks like the kind of turn out one would expect of a Star Wars prequel. 
ON THE VARIOUS FACES OF THE CROWD staring up in silence. Estelle, Wally, Vijay, Trent, Dwayne, George, Lacey, Paul... Nick gives a little wave as if he were a celebrity. The parking lot erupts with CHEERS of his name. A few Berkeley KIDS hold up a sign that reads I'M SINGLE, LET'S 
MINGLE. Then - shouts of warning from the megaphones. And as the flashers and sirens come to life, Nick jumps back into his father's car and peels out. 
I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - DAY Nick glances in the rear view mirror as the cops bear through the cloud kicked up in his wake. 
NICK (V.O.) ...my father, no longer burdened with crippling child support payments, would now be able to afford the model BMW he always wanted... 
I/E. BMW M6SMG - MOVING - FLASHFORWARD - DAY Dwayne sticks his head out the window and shouts with glee as his flab flaps in the wind. 
NICK (V.O.) ...and would come to find the surrogate son he always wanted in Dwayne, the only organism alive that could possibly appreciate George's driving. As the car accelerates, we see the vanity plate reads THUNDER 
ROD. 
NICK (V.O.) Leaving just one last piece of business. 
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 
And finally we arrive on Sheeni, expressionless. And as we continue to PAN we reach... Carlotta standing in the background. The bombshell haircut and thick glasses can barely be made out through her veil. Paul finishes his trumpet solo and there is a moment of silence to observe the open casket and the SINGLE, LET'S MINGLE shirt and shorts that are being buried inside. 
EXT. CEMETERY - DUSK 
Sheeni makes her way toward the line of limos and hearses. She approaches the distant Carlotta. 
SHEENI Excuse me. Are you a friend of Nick's? Carlotta looks up, startled. She composes herself and shakes Sheeni's hand. 
NICK/CARLOTTA A terribly old friend. Carlotta Ulanksy. I'm sorry for your loss. 
SHEENI You shouldn't be, Carlotta. I am no doubt culpable for Nick's actions. 
NICK/CARLOTTA Well, love does compel us to desperate acts. People cannot always act rationally. 
(MORE) 
NICK/CARLOTTA (cont'd) The greater the love, the stronger the passions, the more reckless the crimes. Sheeni lets go a slight, wistful smile. 
SHEENI Yes, Carlotta. Nick had wonderful a way of making me feel worthy of the pursuit. 
NICK/CARLOTTA My dear, if there's one thing the demise of Nick Twisp has taught me, it's that self worth comes from within. Sheeni gives a pensive nod. 
SHEENI Would you like to stay the night, Carlotta? We can reminisce of our departed. 
NICK/CARLOTTA Oh, my. A kind offer, but I really must... 
SHEENI It's just... I don't think I could bear to be alone tonight. Carlotta does her best not to look conflicted, but it shows. 
INT. SHEENI'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Carlotta hurriedly finishes tucking herself in while Sheeni brushes in the bathroom. Carlotta hastily switches out the light. Sheeni emerges in a few small scraps of flimsy black lace. 
NICK/CARLOTTA Goodness. What an attractive negligee. 
SHEENI Do you like it? I bought it in Santa Rosa last fall. I had hoped to wear it for Nick. 
NICK/CARLOTTA Oh, darling, I'm sure he would have found it most... Appealing. Sheeni crawls into bed. She cuddles close. 
SHEENI I like lying here with you, Carlotta. 
NICK/CARLOTTA You do? 
SHEENI I can't think of anyone I'd rather lie here with. Carlotta furrows her brow. 
SHEENI Except maybe Nick. If Nick were here, what do you suppose he would do to me? 
NICK/CARLOTTA Make love to you I would think. 
SHEENI Then why don't you? 
NICK/CARLOTTA Pardon? 
SHEENI Take off that silly wig and make love to me! Sheeni tugs off the wig and tosses it across the room. 
NICK Sheeni! You knew! 
SHEENI Of course, Nick. Did you really expect to fool your soul mate with such a disguise? Nick swoons, grasping her gauze-glazed nakedness. 
SHEENI Take me darling! And as they engage in a feverish kiss, ROUSING HYMNS surge. The church chorus' joyful song rings Hallelujah. The two lovers are entwined before an abstract RED 
BACKGROUND. 
LAS VEGAS OF THE BODY Into the NICK'S PENIS nightclub where champagne bottles POP with the ringing in of a new era, and the Leopards ROAR, and the stage erupts with fireworks.

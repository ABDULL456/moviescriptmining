"BAD LIEUTENANT" 
by 
Abel Ferrara and Zoe Lund 
FIRST DRAFT 
This story takes place during a World Series between the Mets and the A's. Canseco plays for Oakland, and Strawberry is still with New York. 
DAY ONE: 
GAME THREE: LT WINS 
EXT: EARLY MORNING - LT'S HOME - QUEENS 
This typical QUEENS HOUSE is sandwiched between other neighboring, nearly identical HOUSES. 
The MORNING SOUNDS Of FAMILY BICKERING, LAWN MOWERS, and SHOUTED GOOD-BYES are heard coming from many HOUSES on this close-knit block. A NEW BABY can be heard BAWLING inside LT'S HOUSE. 
LT, hurried and harried, stumbles out his FRONT DOOR. He heads for his CAR, parked askew in the DRIVEWAY. 
LT is some 40 years old. His natural swagger makes up for his lack of conventional good looks. He is obviously hung- over. 
LT squints, pained by the SUN. He fumbles with his SHADES, puts them on. 
LT's TWIN EIGHT YEAR-OLD SONS trundle out the FRONT DOOR of the HOUSE, bickering as they run to catch up with their Daddy. The hefty TWINS wear ill-fitting PAROCHIAL SCHOOL UNIFORMS. Their oversize PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BRIEFCASES threaten to trip them up. 
LT's WIFE, BABE in arms, comes out to watch LT's lovely SEVEN YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER head off toward her school on foot. Many other members of LT's EXTENDED FAMILY hang out on the STOOP and the LAWN. 
As the TWINS cross the LAWN, the bickering turns physical. They start whacking each other with the BRIEFCASES. The TWINS pile into LT'S CAR. 
CUT TO: 
INT: MORNING - LT'S CAR - EN ROUTE TO/AT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL 
The CAR is obviously LT's home away from home. FOOD DEBRIS, BEER CANS, VODKA BOTTLES and other garbage litter the interior. 
An impressive HAND-GUN is visible between the seats. 
An old ICON of MOTHER MARY rides on the DASHBOARD. 
As the TWINS get in, LT tries to hide the GUN and the illicit detritus. 
To little avail. The TWINS pay no mind to his machinations; they have evidently seen it all before. 
As LT drives the TWINS to SCHOOL, the three play wild rough- house. 
LT gives a cursory glance to the crime scene. A couple of COPS greet him; LT keeps walking. 
The BET COP digs his attitude. 
BET COP But hey -- we make the best of it, man, don't we? Huh? How about them Mets! 
FOLLOW LT - over to a GROUP of COPS. They greet him and everyone immediately crams into a parked CAR. The CAR stays parked for the duration of their meeting. 
CUT TO: 
INT: AFTERNOON - UNMARKED COP CAR (PARKED) - QUEENS 
Now that LT, the BET COP and the OTHER COPS are inside the CAR, they can do business. LT pays several COPS their WINNINGS for last night's game. CASH and congratulatory banter is exchanged. 
Now LT has to take their BETS for tomorrow afternoon's GAME, the FOURTH GAME of the World Series. LT urges the COPS to bet against the Mets. 
LT No fucking way they're gonna do it in four games straight. 
COP ONE You serious, man? I wanna go Mets all the way! 
LT Go ahead, man.If you've got shit for brains. But if you wanna win the bucks, go with Oakland. 
COP TWO I thought Strawberry was gonna -- 
LT I know that nigger like he's my brother. He ain't gonna let us off so easy. He'll make us sweat first. This game's going to Oakland. Not a doubt in my mind, man. 
Silence. The COPS think about it for a moment. 
BET COP speaks up first; hands LT some CASH. When he talks to LT, his fawning posture is obvious. 
BET COP I'm in. Here. 
COP ONE SHRUGS his assent, gives CASH to LT. The OTHER COPS follow his example, place their BETS on OAKLAND. 
The COP BETS total $800 -- on OAKLAND. LT has obviously been the bookie for this precinct for a long time. He takes care of a lot of action and has these guy's faith. 
LT nods a goodbye, quickly gets out of the CAR. The BET COP and the OTHER COPS remain inside. 
CUT TO: 
EXT: AFTERNOON - PAY PHONE - MIDTOWN - 38TH STREET & 3RD AVENUE 
LT pulls up alone beside a PHONE BOOTH and phones in the COPS' bets and his own to LITE. More than an anonymous connection to the BOOKIE, LITE is obviously LT's old friend -- and a hustler just like himself. 
LT shouts into the PHONE and holds it close to his ear. The TRAFFIC NOISE is loud and irritating. 
LT (into the phone) I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the 
LT What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you? 
JC The rich kind. (shakes his head) Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide. 
LT Fuck you. (takes a deep hit) Just give me back a little something for the road. 
LT takes a handful of the COKE and puts it in a DOLLAR BILL; pockets it. 
JC See you in a coupla days. Have the cash ready. 
JC splits, runs up the stairs. 
CUT TO: 
INT: NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM 
Religious/hip artifacts abound. It's a nice, if messy apartment. 
However, it is definitely not large enough to merit the $3,500 that ARIANE quotes as her rent. 
ARIANE is LT's mistress. 
BOWTAY, her girlfriend, lounges on the COUCH. BOWTAY plays the third when LT is in the mood for a menage a trois. She's around a lot. 
BOWTAY is already zonked out on something. Maybe LUDES. 
ARIANE Got something good for us? 
LT gives her the COKE. ARIANE takes some immediately. BOWTAY sloppily partakes. 
Before LT can even sit down, the GIRLS start bitching. 
ARIANE I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant! 
LT Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man! 
ARIANE It's nothing. This is New York, man... (beat) Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money! 
ANGLE - BOWTAY on the COUCH. It's obvious that she's going nowhere. And fast. 
ARIANE We've been rehearsing a new monologue. From Shad's Saint Joan, you know? Bowtay does it wonderfully well. 
LT breaks out more COKE and some GRASS. 
LT All right, Bowtay. Show us your stuff. 
ARIANE lifts BOWTAY to her feet. BOWTAY staggers into the center of the room, then falls back down on her knees. It happens to be appropriate for the scene. 
EXT/INT: LATE NIGHT - KOREAN DELI 
LT approaches the market where he intends to buy the DIET COKES. 
A display of FRESH FRUITS & VEGETABLES extends onto the sidewalk. 
LT notices a SQUAD CAR, parked in front of the MARKET. LT picks up his pace. 
Closer now, LT sees a YOUNG UNIFORMED COP outside, standing with the KOREAN OWNER, an elderly man who doesn't speak much English. The OWNER is agitated and out of breath. He argues fiercely with TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS. 
A SQUAD CAR is parked in front of the MARKET. 
LT gets an idea. He takes command. 
LT (to Cop) What's going on? 
The UNIFORMED COP is a timid rookie. 
COP Uh, Lieutenant, Sir -- The owner says they stole cash from the register. He was chasing them down the block when I caught up with them. 
The KOREAN OWNER is still agitated. He tries to give his side of the story, mixing English and Korean. At the same time -- 
The TWO BLACK KIDS plead their case. They try to drown out the OWNER. It all gets rather noisy. 
YOUNG BLACK KID We didn't do nothing, man ! 
LT shouts in the YOUNG BLACK KID'S FACE. It's shockingly loud. 
LT Shut the fuck up! 
LT turns to the UNIFORMED COP. 
LT (to Cop) Go get me a Bud. A High Boy. And make sure it's fucking cold. (indicates the situation at hand) I'll straighten this out. 
The UNIFORMED COP looks at LT for a moment, then goes. 
LT is now alone with the KOREAN OWNER and the TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS. 
LT turns to the OWNER. 
LT How much did they take? 
KOREAN OWNER Five hundred dollars cash. 
The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS continue protesting their innocence. 
YOUNG BLACK KID We didn't -- 
CUT TO: 
INT: DAWN - ARIANE'S APARTMENT 
BOWTAY is curled up on the floor, asleep. 
ARIANE is busy with a GOBLET, some TIN FOIL and other esoteric stuff. 
LT comes through the door with the SIX-PACK of DIET COKES and the SIX-PACK of BUDWEISER. 
He puts them down, takes a BEER for himself. ARIANE doesn't turn around. She's busy preparing drugs. 
ARIANE I got you a present. Better shit then you got, cop! 
LT comes and looks over her shoulder. He sees -- 
A PILE of BROWN HEROIN on a TIN FOIL SHEET. ARIANE is preparing the implements for "chasing the dragon." 
BOWTAY rolls over, sprawls on the floor in an even sexier position. 
On her face, an expression of utter bliss. 
LT abandons the BEER. 
LT Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in -- 
ARIANE Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant... 
ARIANE helps LT with the thin, TIN FOIL PIPE. She burns the SMACK on the TIN FOIL SHEET for him so that he can manage to inhale the PLUME OF SMOKE in time. 
He gets a nice, deep hit. 
ARIANE gracefully takes a hit of her own. 
They are both very high, already. Beginning to NOD OUT. 
ARIANE goes back to the IMPLEMENTS and prepares another hit. 
This time she catches the SMOKE in a SHERRY GOBLET and LT drinks it. 
LT is very high now. A meditative, hallucinatory state. 
ARIANE takes a DIET COKE and lies down on the BED. 
She slowly sips soda through a straw. Her eyes are closed. 
LT sits in an EASY CHAIR by the WINDOW. 
TWINS (shrug - in unison) It's 7-0: Oakland. (single Twin) That nigger could have let it drop and gone home. 
LT curses and stomps around. The TWINS mimic his every move. All three are pissed. The rest of the FAMILY pays no mind. 
CUT TO: 
INT: EVENING - LT'S CAR 
LT is furious. He COKES UP. DRINKS heavily. 
Tired of the SPORTS STATIONS, LT turns on 911. There is a call for an uptown MURDER SCENE. 
HARD CUT TO: 
EXT: NIGHT - 153RD/MARTIN LUTHER KING - CRIME SCENE 
CU - A YOUNG BLACK DEALER, eyes open, shot dead. 
LT drives up, sizes up the scene. It's fresh territory. He'll milk it for what it's worth. 
LT ignores his colleagues, the COPS ON THE SCENE. He knows some of the DEALERS and STREET CHARACTERS on the sidelines. 
He heads straight for them. 
LT greets an impressively beautiful, six foot tall TRANSVESTITE. He takes her aside. 
LT Hey, Veronica baby, looking good! What's going down? 
LT slips a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL into VERONICA'S well-filled BRA. 
VERONICA (confidentially - to LT) Willie got shot by one of his boys. (giggles) But there's a ki under the back seat. 
LT I'll put it in my trunk. 
LT saunters up to the MURDER CAR, DEAD WILLIE still in the front seat. LT is obviously berserk to get the KI, but he can't show it. LT susses out the situation. 
Around him, POLICE TECHNICIAN-TYPES are busy lifting fingerprints and analyzing the CAR and WILLIE -- to no apparent avail. 
LT uses his Lieutenants' privilege to enter the MURDER CAR and begin his own investigation. 
TIRE TRACKS are discovered nearby. The OTHER COPS are distracted. 
LT takes his shot. He reaches for and finds the KI of COCAINE under the BACK SEAT. LT slips it under his COAT and emerges from the MURDER CAR. 
Outside the MURDER CAR, LT makes to stand up. In the act, he -- DROPS the BAG of COKE! 
LT is stunned. He can't believe the KI is actually in the shitty, gutter water, in plain view of the other COPS. 
CUT TO: 
INT: LATE NIGHT - CORRIDORS OF A CITY HOSPITAL - HUNTING FOR THE NUN 
The HOSPITAL is an inferno. LT exploits his cop privileges; shows his BADGE to the GUARDS. 
He wants to get into the inner sanctum. Beyond where even COPS were allowed to go. He wants to get to the NUN. 
A sexy NURSE stops him. 
NURSE Can I help you? 
LT can't help but check her out and flirt. 
LT I'm in charge of the investigation. Just checking security. 
NURSE (Suspicious) Security? 
LT Do you want those guys coming back? For the nun? Or for you? 
The NURSE looks at him, unsure, then walks off down the CORRIDOR. 
LT continues his hunt. 
He comes upon a DOOR that is plastered with "QUARANTINE" SIGNS. One too many, perhaps. LT senses the NUN is inside. 
He has to open the DOOR, but hopes he won't get a blast of disease in his face. He CROSSES himself -- wearing a smirk, but nonetheless. Going on instinct, LT opens the door a crack. 
He's right. It's the NUN. He positions himself outside the DOOR, keeping it open a few inches. He peeks inside without being seen. 
CUT TO: 
INT: LATE NIGHT - THE NUN'S HOSPITAL EXAMINING ROOM 
From just outside the door, LT peep-toms on the NUN while she is being examined. He sees her stark naked, laid out on a table, her legs spread wide apart. 
The DOCTORS, NURSES, COUNSELORS work on the NUN as if they are automatons. They don't grasp either the humanity or the trotitism of the scene. LT does. The image of The Alabaster Nun turns him on no end. Yet there is also a deeper pathos to the scene. 
And the NUN is spectacularly beautiful. She doesn't speak. Looks like a Pieta. 
A DOCTOR in a WHITE-COAT reads the MEDICAL REPORT to a FEMALE COP. The FEMALE COP writes down the details on a hard-backed pad. As if it's a parking ticket. 
The moving contrast between the words and the image seems to be apparent to LT -- and the NUN -- alone. 
DOCTOR (to Female Cop) They inserted a crucifix eleven centimeters into her vaginal aperture, breaking the hymen membrane. Then they pursued the same course with their natural organs of sexual penetration. They used a sharp object, probably a hunting knife with a curved blade, to carve a cross between her shoulder blades, entering the flesh an average of nearly one centimeter throughout the area of the wound. They -- 
Finally, as if she knew he was there all along, the NUN looks up at where LT is hiding and boldly meets his eyes. 
ARIANE Do you believe in God? Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?. 
LT hesitates. 
ARIANE kneels down in front of LT. As if in prayer. 
She starts giving him head. 
Before he can answer The Question, he is saved by the bell. The PHONE RINGS. LT picks up immediately. It's LITE. 
As LT speaks to LITE, ARIANE continues to give him head. 
LT (to LITE; over the phone) Yeah, I know, I know all about it. Enough already about the fucking nuns. Yeah. Yeah. So just take the bet. Don't give me any hassles, man. Just put in my bet. 30 G's. Yeah. And I got $900 from the cops on Oakland. Yeah. Right. Strawberry's gonna knock em dead. Of course he is! You know that! Yeah. Yeah. Have faith, man! OK. Right. 
LT hangs up, thinks ARIANE won't resurface the God Question. 
ARIANE does, even as she gives him head. Every time she speaks, she pulls away and it frustrates him. This dialectic continues throughout the scene. 
ARIANE Do you believe in God? 
LT thinks about it, even as ARIANE gets him hotter and hotter. 
LT The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way. 
ARIANE I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God? 
LT What's to believe? 
ARIANE That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins. 
LT can't respond. He's distracted by his own pleasure. 
ARIANE does something OC that causes LT sudden pain. 
LT cries out. Snaps to attention. Looks at ARIANE. 
ARIANE Your sins, Lieutenant! (beat) And look around you! Where do you think all this shit came from? 
ARIANE gives him head again. LT is more excited now than before she hurt him. 
LT People. 
ARIANE You believe that man is the be-all and end-all? 
LT Yeah. 
ARIANE OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God? 
LT grins. He takes out his own ROLLING PAPER, starts to ROLL a JOINT with their POT. 
LT Well, I'm sure we could arrange something... Unless you fancy a few days in jail... 
He blackmails them into humiliating sex scenes. On a side street off Eleventh Avenue, LT plays it out until dawn. 
CUT TO: 
DAY THREE: 
GAME FIVE: LT LOSES $30,000 
EXT INT: DAWN - THE CHURCH/CONVENT 
LT drives up erratically and parks his CAR in front of the CHURCH/CONVENT. 
LT stumbles into the CHURCH. Alone now, he notes various aspects of the DESECRATION, but can't see much because he's blind drunk. 
The enormous, graphically bloody CRUCIFIX confronts him. 
He collapses immediately into a PEW. Sleeps. 
TIME PASSES 
CUT TO: 
INT: MORNING - CHURCH/CONVENT 
LT wakes up. Ruckus all around him. The COPS are there in force -- including some of the guys from the BAR, the UPTOWN MURDER and the HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. They are privately checking out the Scene of the Crime, looking for leads that will give them an advantage. Everyone wants the TWO NUNS to talk. The NUNS are in a circle of interrogators. At first, LT can't even see them. 
The ELDERLY NUN was attacked but not raped. They carved crosses on her. 
In the background, the questioning has already begun. The interrogators become increasingly frustrated. It can be heard in their voices. They want the reward, and -- despite a certain constipated "respect" in their attitude -- the COPS are willing to browbeat the NUNS to get it. 
LT silently bums a COFFEE off a COP and staggers into the ring. 
LT hangs back in the crowd, staring at the YOUNG NUN as the COPS interrogate both NUNS. 
COP 1 Can't you tell us anything? Sisters? Anything at all? 
The ELDERLY NUN speaks up. 
ELDERLY NUN They broke my glasses. I didn't see anything, but I did hear them. They were young. And there were two of them. They spoke Spanish. One of them was named Julio. 
LT, on the sidelines, turns to an OLDER COP. LT mutters his commentary 
LT (to Older Cop) Julio. Great. There are 20,000 spics named "Julio". 
CUT TO: 
INT: AFTERNOON  "WHITE" CHURCH  HIS DAUGHTER'S FIRST COMMUNION 
CU  LT'S EIGHT YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER takes the WAFER for the first time. 
LT is dressed to kill. Looks like a corpse. 
He watches his DAUGHTER'S First Communion and is truly moved. 
Remembers his own past. 
While the rest of the attendant EXTENDED FAMILY, FRIENDS, and SOME COPS enter the COMMUNION PARADE, LT stands alone at the back of the CHURCH like an usher. He holds the COLLECTION BASKET and quietly watches the whole scene. 
LT, his betting friend who is not a cop comes up beside him. 
LITE OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do? 
LT I wanna go double or nothing on the next game. 
LITE Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind? 
LT I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money 
LITE Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it! 
LT (stoic) There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out. 
LITE looks his friend up and down as if he's lost his mind. 
LITE Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac! 
LT That's my problem. Just put in my bet. 
LITE gestures assent, but is not happy. He waits a moment, looks around. 
POV LITE - LT'S FRIENDS and FAMILY. LT'S DAUGHTER in her COMMUNION DRESS. 
From the pristine interior of the "WHITE CHURCH" we -- 
HARD CUT TO: 
INT: AFTERNOON  THE CHURCH/CONVENT 
The interior of the CHURCH/CONVENT is still desecrated. In stark contrast to the "White Church" (above, Scene 22). 
POLICE ROPES have cordoned off certain desecrated areas of the CHURCH. In other places, MOPS and SLOPPY BUCKETS of SHIT- WATER wait for someone to finish cleaning up. 
When the DOORMAN sights LT, he lifts the ROPE, nods respectfully at the habitual patron. 
CUT TO: 
INT: EVENING - LIMELIGHT NIGHTCLUB - THE V.I.P. ROOM 
LT arrives. 
The V.I.P. ROOM is more laid-back, less populous than the throng-filled cave outside. The MUSIC is muted here, and more interesting. 
PARTIERS sit at the BAR, or at COCKTAIL TABLES. CHIC WAITRONS serve the clientele: HOTSHOT BOHEMIAN REGULARS, DRUG DEALERS and HOPEFUL RICH ADDICTS. In the privacy of the V.I.P.ROOM, drug use is hardly concealed. 
LT sashays over to LITE'S table, sits down. LT has taken on an attitude of false bravado. He greets LITE with a crazy grin. LITE is grim, doesn't respond in kind. He's not amused. 
LT orders a VODKA. 
LITE Do you have the money? 
LT (giggles) What money? 
LITE Don't bullshit me. 
LT keeps doing COKE off hs wrist, even as ne speaks to LITE. LT can't seem to wipe the smile off his face. 
LT I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone. 
LITE This psycho can. 
LT Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game. 
LITE (laughs in his face) You're a fucking joke, you know that? (turns grim) He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that! 
LT Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure the bet gets in. 
A COCKTAIL WAITRESS delivers LT's VODKA. LT orders another one, flirts with her -- she's gone in a flash. LT downs the VODKA in one shot. 
LITE You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids -- 
LT Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and -- 
LITE He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it? 
LT I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic. 
This breaks LT up. He laughs until he cries. LITE watches the spectacle. Falls silent. They sit quietly for a moment. 
LT, impatient with the delivery of his second VODKA, takes a bottle cut of his COAT and re-fills his GLASS. DRINKS it down. 
LT gets up a moment later, brushes himself off, and swaggers out of the V.I.P. ROOM. 
CUT TO: 
INT: NIGHT - THE LIMELIGHT CLUB 
LT is in the throng again. The MUSIC blasts, the PARTIERS push and shove... 
LT elbows his way through the crowd. 
He makes moves on GIRLS. Banters with PATRONS. At the DOOR, he hesitates before going out, dallies with the BOUNCER. 
LT felt safe in the CLUB. New he's gotta go OUTSIDE. He's shit-scared. 
EXT. LT leaves the CLUB for the STREET, looking over his shoulder all the way. 
CUT TO: 
INT: NIGHT - STAIRWELL OF J.C.'S APARTMENT BUILDING 
LT enters an APARTMENT BUILDING, faces a dark and sinister staircase. 
STRANGE NOISES come from the APARTMENTS ABOVE. 
LT climbs. He hugs the wall, GUN at the ready. To LT, it seems some gothic horror may await him at any turn. 
On one landing, he comes upon a PIT-BULL. A GRANDMOTHER pulls him back inside an APARTMENT by the LEASH. 
On another landing, he sees a JUNKIE SHOOTING UP in the shadows. On another landing, a BIG GUY comes barreling out of his APARTMENT and down the stairs, almost bringing LT down with him. 
On another landing, a guy is taking out very PECULIAR GARBAGE. It might be body parts to an active imagination. At last, he reaches the DOOR to the APARTMENT for which he's been looking. 
HARD CUT TO: 
INT: NIGHT - J.C.'S STRAIGHT PUERTO RICAN APARTMENT 
A cheerful apartment. Quite different in atmosphere from the STAIRWELL, above. 
A large, multi-generation PUERTO RICAN FAMILY sits around the dinner table, eating CHICKEN ON RICE AND BEANS. JC is at the table. 
RELIGIOUS ARTIFACTS abound. 
A CODED KNOCK on the DOOR. 
JC jumps up to answer it. 
It's LT. (The hideous stairs led here.) 
POV LT - RAPID. ERRATIC. HAND HELD - LT looks for SNIPERS in the anonymous dark WINDOWS on the anonymous darks walls that create the mescarole canyon of the STREET. 
LT is entirely alone. He is stock-still, victim of his own terror. 
Suddenly. LT can move. He takes out his GUN, presses himself against the nearest WALL. From that position, he hears -- 
A BRASH FEMALE VOICE, coming from somewhere in the darkness. 
It is almost as loud as the "SHOT". 
BRASH FEMALE VOICE (OC) Hey motherfucker! Take that backfire up the ass! 
LT can't believe that there is no "SNIPER", there was never any SHOT. It was a BACKFIRE! 
ANGLE - The CAR in question passes by. It HONKS, defiantly. 
Evidently, it is the CAR that had BACKFIRED. 
BRASH FEMALE VOICE (OC) Fuck you. 
LT is still pressed against the wall, GUN at the ready. He cannot be relieved. The terror is with him. 
CUT TO: 
INT: LATE NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT 
LT rushes in, triple bolts the DOOR behind him. He immediately pulls the DRAPES. 
LT Someone just took a shot at me... 
Ariane laughs. 
ARIANE Sure, baby Sure And you don't do cocaine, either. 
LT turns on her. Adamant. Pleading with her to believe him. 
LT It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me. (beat) You gotta believe me! 
ARIANE (shrugs) Why? 
ARIANE walks away, speaks with her back to LT. 
LT Just kick back, baby. Make yourself at home. (suddenly pissed) But of course it won't be nobody's home, if you don't come through with the fucking rent! 
LT lays his COAT down on the BED. Puts the CIGAR BOX of MONEY under it. 
LT sits down near the PHONE. He lights his CRACKPIPE with a MATCH from the MATCHBOOK on which LITE wrote the BOOKIE'S NUMBER. Then he tries to reach the BOOKIE. Some sort of wacky Mob joint answers. 
ARIANE shoots up BOWTAY, next. 
They do it on the BED, exploiting all possible erotic connotations. 
When LT rushes, he gets totally paranoid. Jumps at sounds, sneaks to the WINDOW, hears noises that aren't there. 
Then he flips, and becomes crazy-bold. Opens the DRAPES. Sticks his head out the WINDOW, waves his GUN at specters. 
Then he becomes shit-scared, again. His behavior is lunatic. 
ARIANE LAUGHS at his antics. 
Finally LT becomes wildly sensual. Revealing himself with total abandon. Dances. In the midst of this -- 
The PHONE RINGS LT is seriously startled. Then he realizes who it may be. He slowly answers the phone. 
LT can hardly speak. He is NUDE, and communicating from another world syllable by syllable. 
LT (into the phone) Large? 
LARGE (OC) All right, cop. I want my money. 
LT It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game. 
LARGE (OC) What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game? 
LT Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet. 
LARGE (OC) Let me think about it. 
LT There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing. 
BIG SILENCE on the PHONE. 
LARGE (CO -- lethal) Oh, really? 
LT Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop! 
LARGE (OC) OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it? 
LT absorbs this, then bursts out. 
LT Fuck the nuns, man! I'm talking about Strawberry! Is the bet down? 
LARGE takes a moment. 
LARGE (OC) Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine. 
GAME SEVEN: LT GETS DOUBLE OR NOTHING: $120,000 
INT: DAWN THROUGH HIGH NOON  CHURCH/CONVENT 
CU - The ALABASTER NUN. She is lying cross -- probably has been all night. 
VARIOUS ANGLES. The still-desecrated CHURCH in all its enduring glory. Shafts of blood-red dawn-light. The NUN. 
TIME PASSES. 
VARIOUS ANGLES. Mid-morning; The NUN is still lying cross. 
TIME PASSES. 
VARIOUS ANGLES. High Noon. The NUN is still lying cross. 
Suddenly -- 
LT appears in the doorway, a black silhouette against the white light of noon. For a moment, he watches her from a distance. 
The NUN knows he is there. After a time, she gets up, goes to the altar, kneels. As if waiting for him. 
LT staggers down the center aisle. He's carrying the CIGAR BOX. 
LT joins the NUN, kneeling next to her at the altar. 
ANGLE - The CHALICE is still missing. 
They are all alone. At the ALTAR, before the CRUCIFIX, LT confronts the NUN face to face. The NUN holds her ROSARY BEADS. 
LT finally speaks. He thinks she'll be turned on by his offer of "help". 
LT Listen to me, Sister, listen to me good. The other cops'll just put the guys through the system. They're juveniles. They'll walk! Get it? But I'll beat the system and do justice. Real justice. For you. 
The NUN turns to run. 
NUN I have already forgiven them. 
LT is desperate. He lunges forward. Pleads with her. 
LT Come on lady! They put out cigarettes on your tits, man! Get with the program! Don't you want them behind bars? Or away from the world for good? How could you forgive these motherfu -- excuse me. These guys. How could you? Deep down, don't you want them to pay for what they did to you? Don't you want the crime avenged? 
NUN I have forgiven them. 
LT Nun! These boys still have their weapons, Sister. Your forgiveness will leave blood in its wake. What if they do it to other nuns? Other virgins? Old women who die from the shock? Do you have the rights let these boys go free? Can you bear the burden. Sister? 
The NUN turns to him, simple and pure, pure and simple. 
JESUS I forgive you. 
LT Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I -- 
LT averts his eyes. When he looks up again -- 
JESUS is back on the CROSS. Inert, and yet -- 
LT rises, moves around the interior of the CHURCH. He stumbles, struggles, pleads. Falls, rises, falls and rises again -- as if wrestling with an invisible assailant. 
He collapses in a corner. 
LT Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good. 
JESUS I forgive you. 
EPIPHANY. BLOODY CHRIST ON THE CROSS. HALLELUJAH! 
In the aftermath of his revelation, he notices, cleanly, a hunched, ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN carrying something toward the ALTAR. 
He staggers toward her. Yes. The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN has the CHALICE! 
LT grabs the CHALICE. The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN doesn't let go. 
LT The chalice. Tell me! Who gave it to you! Tell me where the fuck you got it! Take me there! Now! 
At first, she doesn't speak at all. LT begins to CRY. Begs her to tell him. Then he wields his PISTOL, repeats his plea. Then breaks into TEARS. 
She speaks at last. 
ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN I can't tell you. 
Gun in hand, LT gets down on his knees. 
LT In the name of God, you must. 
ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN My husband will give me Hell, Mister. 
LT We've already got Hell, Sister. 
She meets LT's eyes, seems to understand something. Calmly, she tells him what he needs to know. 
ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN It's very hard. He's a -- you're not a cop, are you? 
LT No. Not a cop. 
ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN My husband is a fence. He got this chalice from a couple of kids. Just yesterday, I think. I stole it out of his shop so as to return it to where it ought to be. It's a holy thing, you know. A holy thing. 
LT Shut up. Let's watch the game. 
LT sits down next to the KIDS. SMOKES with them, watches the Game. LT must hold the PIPE for them, as they are HANDCUFFED. 
LT gets them super-high, and himself likewise. He still holds his GUN. 
The KIDS go along with it. Taking it moment to moment. 
All three, despite the situation, are heavily into the Game. 
LT Strawberry... 
PAOLO Yeah... 
After a moment, LT gets up. The KIDS understand that they must do the same. 
LT Give me the robes. 
The KIDS hand over the PURPLE ROBES and LT puts them on. 
JULIO You're not a cop are you? 
LT No. 
LT exits. Taking the KIDS along. He carries the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX. 
CUT TO: 
EXT INT: EVENING - LT'S CAR AND STREETS EN ROUTE TO RENDEZ- VOUS 
VARIOUS ANGLES - LT drives toward the fatal rendez-vous with the BOOKIE. He is wearing the PURPLE ROBES from the CHURCH/CONVENT and has the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX. 
LT has the KIDS handcuffed in the back seat. (The Scene mirrors Scene 2. in which LT drove his own TWINS to school.) 
The FINAL GAME (SEVEN) is on the RADIO. LT is listening, but also not listening. 
LT talks wildly about Jesus Christ. And about the misery they pass in the street. He waves his GUN wildly, punctuating his speech with potentially lethal gestures. He aims the GUN at JULIO and PAULO, then at himself, then out the window, then at the KIDS, again. 
LT Jesus died for your sins, you motherfuckers! Not me. No. I didn't die for your sins. No, not me. Jesus went and did it. (beat) So why did you do what you did? If you want to live, tell me now, motherfuckers! Tell me now! 
LT turns around and looks at JULIO and PAOLO, both of them HANDCUFFED in the back seat. 
POV LT - CU - JULIO and PAOLO both have TEARS running down their cheeks. Silently. 
LT I forgive you. 
LT starts CRYING too, at the same time CURSING at the TRAFFIC.

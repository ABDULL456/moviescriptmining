What do you think I want to melt him with...(Josh, don't forget to take out the garbage)  Just a second!  Throw the...(Josh, did you hear what your mother said?)  One minute!  (Josh Baskin!)  Your hesitancy has cost you dearly.  The wizard, sensing your apprehension, unleashes a fatal blow from the ice scepter.  With luck, you will thaw in several million years.  Great. 
MOM C'mon Josh, it's starting to get awfully late! 
JOSH Okay. Okay. Okay. 
SCENE 2 
JOSH Take the garbage out.  Every day, take the garbage out...Rick Rodin is on the mound for the Yankees!  He looks into the catcher's mitt, shakes off the first signal, takes the turn, wipes the sweat off his brow, leans back and fires...

JOSH Need it.  Got it.  Got it.  Need it...

JOSH Huh? 
SCOTT You've gotta slow down.  Pace yourself.  Slowly!  Slowly! 
JOSH Sorry.  Today's my first day. 
SCOTT I know! 
JOSH So how long have you worked here? 
SCOTT Five years.  Work stinks but the fringe benefits are great!  See that girl over there in the red?  Say hi to her and she'll be yours.  She'll wrap her legs around you so tight you'll be begging for mercy! 
JOSH Well, I'll stay away from her then! 
SCOTT Excuse me.  Yeah Brennan.  I gave it to you yesterday!  Oh, here it is. I don't have time to xerox it.  Let the new guy do it. 
SCENE 27 
MR. M That's total bullshit Paul! 
PAUL Look sir, the favorability rate is... 
MR. M Come on!  Let's not lie to ourselves!  If a kid likes a toy it sells. That's all! 
SUSAN But every bit of research and focus testing... 
MR. M It works with research, it works with focus testing, it just doesn't work with the kids! 
JOSH Sorry!  I'm sorry! 
PAUL Why don't you watch where the hell you're going! 
JOSH Oh, he can't come to the phone right now. 
MOM Why not?  Why not?  What did you do to him?! 
JOSH I didn't do anything to him!  I think he's a terrific kid! 
MOM I want proof that he's all right! 
JOSH Uh, well, all right.  Ask me something that only he would know.  Then I'll ask him for you and that way you'll know that he's okay. 
MOM Ask him what I used to sing to him when he was a little boy. 
JOSH Isn't there something else that you would rather ask him? 
MOM Ask him! 
JOSH Oh, I got it!  I got it!  Memories, like the corner of my mind.  Misty water color memories, of the way we were.  Scattered pictures...Look, you're gonna see him again really soon.  I promise.  I cross my heart. We'll talk about this later.

WOMAN One, two, three... 
SCENE 31 
JOSH I'm never eating again. 
MR. M Only what? 
JOSH Well, the pieces don't move. 
MR. M What do you mean? 
JOSH Well, on the old set you could slide the men up and down the ice, and now all they do is spin around.  It was more like real hockey the old way.  Why did they change it? 
MR. M I don't know. 
JOSH You see, the Star Fighters are good because you can change all the pieces.  But I never liked the Galactakons.  You only get one robot, and they don't come with a vehicle. 
MR. M I see. 
JOSH Plus you can't take them underwater.  And if you do they...Neat! 
MR. M Okay, let's check out the...Piano lessons? 
JOSH Three years. 
MR. M Me too.  Everyday, after school....Chopsticks....What department did you say you were in? 
JOSH Oh, I'm in computers. 
MR. M Computers?  You just saved me a trip to the gym Son. 
SCENE 34 
SUSAN Vice President in charge of Product Development. 
PAUL Vice President!  He's only been here a week!  Vice President?! 
SUSAN And he came from data processing! 
PAUL He's out of his mind!  The old man has finally lost it! 
SUSAN Did you know they gave him Bob's old office? 
PAUL Bob's office?!  Bob's office is bigger than my office!  There's got to be a reason.  Things like this don't happen unless there's a reason. 
SCENE 35 
BILLY You're the luckiest guy I know. 
SCENE 36 
PAUL Did you check Mattel? 
SUSAN Nothing. 
PAUL Colleco? 
SUSAN Zero. 
PAUL He can't come from nowhere Susan.  He has to come from somewhere.  How about Hasbro? 
SUSAN Yes.  And Fisher Price and Worlds of Wonder.  I have called everywhere. Nobody's ever heard of him! 
PAUL Great! 
SUSAN Face it Paul.  The guy comes from data processing. 
PAUL Terrific.  That is just terrific!  This is just terrific! 
SUSAN You're being paranoid Paul. 
SCENE 37 
PAUL These tests were conducted over a six month period using a double-blind format of eight over-lapping demographic groups.  Every region of the country was sampled, the focus testing showed a solid base in the 9 to 11-year old bracket--with a possible carry-over into the 12-year olds. When you consider that Nobots and Transformers pull over 37 percent market share, and that we are targeting the same area, I think that we should see one quarter of that and that is one fifth of the total revenue from all of last year.  Any questions?  Yes?  Yes? 
JOSH I don't get it. 
PAUL What exactly don't you get? 
JOSH It turns from a building into a robot, right? 
PAUL Precisely. 
JOSH Well, what's fun about that? 
PAUL Well, if you had read your industry breakdown, you would see that our success in the action figure area has climbed from 27 percent to 45 percent in the last two years.  There, that might help. 
JOSH Oh. 
PAUL Ho! Ho! Ho!  He is vicious! 
SUSAN He's not vicious. 
PAUL Oh, come on Susan, don't kid yourself.  That man is a killer! 
SUSAN All he said was "I don't get it." 
PAUL I don't get it!  I don't get!  I don't get!  He's going for the throat, trying to eviscerate me!  Did you see the look on Macmillan's face?! 
SUSAN Mmm Hmm. 
SCENE 39 
REALTOR It's quite a unique space.  The lines are so clean and you don't get any of that partition quality.  It has 50-foot ceilings, all hardwood floors, ample closet space, a modern kitchen, a brand new bathroom with a jet stream jacuzzi. 
BILLY We'll take it. 
SCENE 40 
MAN Baskin.  Rental delivery! 
JOSH Dear Mom and Dad.  They said that I could write you and let you know I was okay.  So far, they're treating me fine.  I've got enough to eat and I'm perfectly safe.  They say that I'll get out of here in about a month.  In the mean time, it's a lot like camp!  I watch TV and even get outside once in a while.  I know you miss me.  But try not to worry.  I think this experience might even be good for me.  I love you very much and I know that I'll see you soon.  Your son, Joshua.  P.S. Give Rachel a kiss from her big brother. 
SCENE 41 
WOMAN It's very beautiful and I'm having a lovely time. 
MR. M I'm glad Miss Patterson. 
WOMAN It's much better than last year.  I just wanted to tell you that. 
MR. M I'll have another scotch....Susan. 
SUSAN Love your tux. 
MR. M I think it's the same as the maitre's. 
SUSAN Have you decided what you're doing on the Danberry line? 
MR. M No, I haven't. 
SUSAN They were so, incisive.  It's Beluga.  Macmillan orders it every year....You all right?  You okay?  You want a glass of water?  You want something to drink? 
JOSH Could I have a milkshake or something? 
SUSAN I've got a car outside.  You want to get out of here? 
JOSH Uh Huh. 
SUSAN Let's go. 
SCENE 45 
SUSAN I'm not really a big one for parties.  You know, I like things that are a little more intimate. 
JOSH Wow!  Is this your car? 
SUSAN Well, it's the company's car. 
JOSH Oh, this is the coolest thing I've ever seen! 
SUSAN I mean, just seeing someone in the office, you don't really get a chance to know them.  I mean, just being with you here tonight, I really get a sense of who you are. 
JOSH Are you gonna eat these fries? 
SUSAN No. No.... 
JOSH Hey mister?  You want some of these fries?  We're not going to eat them. 
DRIVER No, thank you. 
SUSAN You see, it's hard in a business situation...I mean there's this invisible line and even you're attracted to someone...What, are you going to call someone before...? 
JOSH No. 
SUSAN Uh, I mean at this point in my life I...Don't...Don't play with the radio...Leave the uh...Don't...I'm really vulnerable right now!  You know...I mean, I love my job and I.... 
JOSH Ejector seat!  This is great!  Hey!  Come on up!  Hey, that was my apartment. 
SUSAN Really?  I'd love to see where you live. 
SCENE 46 
JOSH Wouldn't you rather play basketball?  I know how to play that.  We could be like a team for the Macmillan Company. 
PAUL No. 
JOSH I'm not very good at sports, but I'll give it a try.  My best sport is video hockey. 
PAUL That isn't a sport. 
JOSH Well, it takes eye to hand coordination. 
PAUL It's not a sport if you don't sweat! 
JOSH What about golf?  You don't sweat and that's a sport. 
PAUL Yeah, and you're not sittin' there letting some machine do all the work! 
JOSH What about car racing? 
PAUL Aw shut up Baskin! 
JOSH What are the rules again? 
PAUL I told you.  Over the line to serve.  Yellow is out of bounds.  Play to 21--ready? 
JOSH Sorry.  Sorry. 
PAUL One nothing.  Come on!  Get it!  Get it!  Get it! 
JOSH Okay. 
PAUL Thatta boy!  Okay, you ready?  All right....Ho ho!  Nice try!  That was in!  Two zip.  Just made it.  Two zip.  Ready?  Okay!  Here we go!...19/18. 
JOSH Uh, that was under the line. 
PAUL What? 
JOSH That was under the line.  You said it had to be over the line on a serve. 
PAUL No I didn't. 
JOSH Yeah you did!  You said it had to be over the line on a serve! 
JOSH Well, you work just as hard as he does and you're not like that. 
SUSAN You don't...you don't know me that well. 
JOSH Yes I do.  You're one of the nicest people I've met. 
SUSAN How do you do it? 
SCENE 52 
PAUL What's this? 
SUSAN What does it look like?!  Shampoo, razor, toothpaste, two neckties and your exercise tape!  Oh, and I want my keys back! 
PAUL Sure.  It's just some scratches.  He'll get over it. 
SUSAN Oh, it has nothing to do with him. 
PAUL Oh come on Susan!  He's just another link in the chain!  First it was Tom Caulfield, then Handlen.  Then Golding, then me!  Am I missing somebody? 
SUSAN It's not like that anymore! 
PAUL What is so special about Baskin? 
SUSAN He's a grown up! 
PAUL Susan. 
SUSAN I can't believe you brought up Golding. 
SCENE 53 
BILLY And many more!  What are you going to wish for this time? 
SCENE 54 
BILLY I know what we can do!  We can go out and get some beers, some dirty magazines and go back... 
JOSH Uh, I can't Billy. 
BILLY What you mean you can't?  Of course you can!  It's your birthday! 
SUSAN Listen. 
JOSH What?  Music? 
SUSAN Wanna dance? 
JOSH Dance? 
SUSAN Well we don't have to if you don't want to. 
JOSH Okay.  Okay. 
SUSAN All right. JOSH Okay....Are you cold? 
SUSAN Mm Mm. 
JOSH We could get some hot chocolate....You can wear my jacket if you want. 
SCENE 58 
SUSAN Oh, I haven't done this in a long time....What were you like when you were younger? 
JOSH Oh, I wasn't much different. 
SUSAN I believe that about you....I've been thinking about you a lot....It's crazy....In my car, lying in bed....I've just never gone out with someone like you....With all the other men there was so much to hide....I feel like I can tell you anything. 
JOSH Susan?  There's something I think I should tell you. 
SUSAN What? 
SCENE 59 
SUSAN You want the light on? 
SCENE 60

SUSAN I know. 
SCENE 63

SUSAN Send out for some sandwiches. 
MR. M Maybe next year, all right?  Next year. 
SCENE 65 
SUSAN You can do it.  I know you can! 
JOSH I cannot plan a whole line! 
SUSAN Why?  Nobody knows more about toys in the entire company! JOSH Susan, doing that means marketing and strategy and stuff like that! 
SUSAN All he wants is a proposal! 
JOSH I can't! 
JOSH Well, Wednesday would be better than Thursday... 
WOMAN Mr. Baskin can't be disturbed! 
JOSH Yeah, I have the Keating example right here...

JOSH Shh!  I'm right in the middle of something okay? 
BILLY That's the list.  All you've got to do is call! 
JOSH Can you give me just a minute, please? 
BILLY What are you talking about?  This is the list! 
JOSH Would you come back at lunch?  All right, I'm a little bit busy right now...Hello?

BILLY Who the fuck do you think you are?! 
JOSH Hey! 
BILLY Hey, you're Josh Baskin!  Remember?  You broke your arm on my roof! You hid in my basement when Robert Diceman was about to rip your head off! 
JOSH You don't get it, do you?  This is important! 
BILLY I'm your best friend.  What's more important than that, huh?  I'm three months older than you are--asshole! 
SCENE 69 
SUSAN Oh!  And who isn't?  You think that there isn't a frightened kid inside of me, too! 
JOSH No!  I mean I really am thirteen!  I went to bed one night and I was a kid, and when I woke up the next morning I was a grown up. 
SUSAN Oh right!  And just yesterday I was a school girl with pigtails!  Why are you doing this Josh? 
JOSH There was this carnival in New Jersey.  I made a wish on this machine. It was called a Zoltar Machine... 
SUSAN Oh stop it! 
JOSH It was called a Zoltar Machine!  It had this bobbing head that looked just like a devil and if you got a quarter in the devil's mouth you could make a wish and I did!  So I made a wish to be big!  That is what I'm trying to tell you!  I changed into a grown up but I'm really just a kid! 
SUSAN Fine Josh!  You're a kid!  Look, I really don't know what it is that you're trying to tell me.  But we have a very big presentation to give tomorrow, so I'm going to get some sleep. 
SCENE 70

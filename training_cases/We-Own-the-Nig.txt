WE OWN THE NIGHT 
Written by 
James Gray 
FADE IN: 
A PAIR OF SMOKESTACKS AGAINST AN ORANGE AUTUMN SUN SKY... THE CAMERA ZOOMS OUT to REVEAL: A CEMETERY in the foreground. TOMBSTONES blend into a NEVER-ENDING SEA OF MIDDLE-CLASS ROW HOUSES in the distance, and nothing seems to separate the two. A NEWLY DUG GRAVE is in the LOWER LEFT-HAND CORNER of our FRAME. 
MILITARY DRUMS. HUNDREDS of POLICEMEN, in their DRESS BLUES, ENTER from FRAME RIGHT. A FEW COPS CARRY a COFFIN. 
SUPERIMPOSE ON THE SCREEN'S LEFT SIDE: THE FOLLOWING WORDS FADE IN--PARAGRAPH BY PARAGRAPH: 
New York, New York.   1988. 
A new breed of narcotics has swept the great city, bringing with it a ferocious crime wave more terrifying than any in recent memory. 
The old criminal order is gone. In its place, new ethnic groups rise up to seize control without respect for traditional rules of engagement. 
Outmanned and outgunned, demoralized by cutbacks and scandal, the Police find themselves burying one of their own at the rate of twice a month... 
The WORDS TURN BLOOD RED, then DISAPPEAR. The POLICE LOWER THE COFFIN when they arrive at the SITE. As we begin to ZOOM INTO a CLOSE ANGLE ON THEM, we HEAR MUSIC. A THUMPING POP BEAT. THE CLASH'S "ROCK THE CASBAH"... SMASH CUT TO: 
CLOSE ON: BOBBY GREEN, thirty. He is passionate and vital and handsome, a real physical presence. His CLOTHES are stylish, expensive. A sly SMILE. He steps forward, into: 
INT. STOREROOM 
The camera MOVES with him to SEE: ROSARIO DIAZ, twenties, dark-skinned, impossibly gorgeous. Leaning up against the wall, biting her lower lip, eyeing Bobby with true desire. 
BOBBY GREEN ...you're so fuckin' beautiful, you know that...? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She beams. They kiss, PASSIONATELY. SUPERIMPOSE: "BROOKLYN". They really GO AT IT. They are ferocious; as they DEVOUR each other: 
ROSARIO DIAZ I love you, baby... 
Then we HEAR a fist BANGING ON A DOOR, a MUFFLED VOICE: 
MUFFLED VOICE Bobby!   You in there? 
No ANSWER--they're too busy making out. Then, MORE BANGING. They both START LAUGHING. The voice continues: 
MUFFLED VOICE (CONT'D) Bobby! [If] you two could just keep your hands off each other for a second--I, I think we got a situation brewin' out front! 
ROSARIO DIAZ It's Jumbo... We gotta go anyway... 
BOBBY GREEN (beat; to the door) I'll be out in a second, Louis! 
She grabs him; he moves back in, starts MAULING her again. She SLIDES DOWN his body, perhaps to perform fellatio... 
CUT TO: 
INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - MAIN ROOM 
A huge, bustling, vibrant nightclub, very `80's. Decadent, pure New York. BOBBY emerges from the back room area, straightening out his outfit. ROSARIO is behind him, fixing herself and walking toward the front of the club. Bobby enters the PULSING, VITAL HEART of the place. As he appears, everyone approaches, happily shouting out his name. He is having a blast. 
Bobby is the master of this domain. An `80's version of Tony Manero from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, but without kitsch. He is genuine cool. MUSIC: BLONDIE'S "HEART OF GLASS." Bobby waves hello to people, greets them ("Hey, baby!"), a pretty girl kisses him (the women love him). Moves with a swagger, a DANCE. As he sways, he re-buttons his shirt, claps his hands. He is the CLUB MANAGER, and HE LOVES every minute of it. He's GIDDY, ALIVE, a PERMANENT GRIN. WE WANT HIS LIFE. SENSUOUS, SEDUCTIVE, INCREDIBLE FUN. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
A MAN waves to BOBBY. Bobby SEES: seated at a table, surrounded by his gang: VADIM NEZHINSKI. Thirty-five, acne- scarred, huge black pompadour, big gut. One of his men, PAVEL LUBYARSKY, is next to him. Bobby nods back to them. 
NEAR THE COAT CHECK 
Rosario meets up with several of her girlfriends, and we SEE an OPERATION at work: people come get their coats, slide the coat check girls a HUNDRED BUCKS, and with their coats the patrons get JUNK put in their jacket pockets. Rosario looks to one of her girls--ALINA, a young Russian with too much makeup--and counts the cash. Pockets some of it. From Rosario's BEHAVIOR, we SEE she's INVOLVED in the DRUG TRADE. 
INT. THE FRONT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT - LOBBY 
A HUGE FIGHT that's breaking out. Violent. Club patrons and SECURITY GUYS are in the melee. Girls SCREAM. ROSARIO moves past all this, to the front door. LOUIS FALSETTI, forty, backs off from the multiple struggles all around him. Louis is wearing a jacket that says "SECURITY" on it. He is the jocular type, very overweight, redfaced. Bobby arrives at the fight scene. With cheery braggadocio: 
BOBBY GREEN What the fuck's goin' on in here? 
Bobby moves RIGHT IN. Grabs a struggling and drunk PATRON, puts him in a headlock. He gives the Patron a SHOT TO THE TEMPLE, just to keep him docile. Lou, Bobby's best friend, watches the imbroglio with an amused and cowardly detachment, CHORTLING with every punch and scream. He balances a drink in his hand with marvelous care, avoiding spillage. But the BATTLE GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER. Seeing his friend Bobby, who's hardly got everything in control: 
LOUIS FALSETTI Okay, Bobkes! Looks like you got everything under control here--so uh, so I'm gonna go outside, take my break! 
BOBBY GREEN Yeah--just keep that wide load of yours outta trouble, arright? 
LOUIS FALSETTI Yes, your fuckin' majesty! 
The Patron is acting up again, trying to free himself from Bobby's grip. Bobby looks down at him. With humor: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOBBY GREEN What're you doing?!? You gotta behave yourself here! 
Gives the guy a shot in the head. Meanwhile: LOUIS saunters past the melee, jumping gracefully over a fallen drunk. He BOWS in triumph when others applaud his leap. Everyone laughs as he goes out the door. Bouncer FREDDIE helps clean up the mess. A GIRL SCREAMS as a GUY is flipped on his back by bouncers. A PATRON with BLOOD ON HIS FACE, acting like an eight year-old, to Bobby (who hurls his guy out of frame): 
BLOODIED PATRON C'mon, Mr. Green! I didn't do nothing! 
BOBBY GREEN Well now you're gonna do nothing someplace else! (louder, to all fighters; pointing:) Now listen--one of these days I'm gonna run this whole block, and I see any you in here again--any you-- I'll bust your fuckin' hole! (to Freddie) Throw `em out on their ass. I gotta go upstairs, drop off my keys with the old man. 
We MOVE past partygoers. THEN, APPEARING AT THE TOP OF THE STEPS: Bobby and Rosario--who's being eyed up and down salaciously by the men in the party. The two start to come down the narrow stairs leading to the basement. A portly, ebullient man, RUSSELL DE KEIFER: 
RUSSELL DE KEIFER Bobby? Bobby Grusinsky, that you? How you doin'?! (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: RUSSELL DE KEIFER (CONT'D) It's me, Russell De Keifer, from across Northern Boulevard, remember? You still bartending that Russian joint, out there in Brooklyn? 
BOBBY GREEN Nah.   Nah, I'm managing now. 
RUSSELL DE KEIFER Oh, big shot! 
BOBBY GREEN Yeah. I'll see you `round, arright? 
Bobby slinks past De Keifer.     Rosario touches his arm: 
ROSARIO DIAZ What'd he call you? 
BOBBY GREEN (slightly sheepish) I changed my name--I use my mother's name now. It's better for business. C'mon... 
INT. BASEMENT 
A wiry YOUNG POLICE REPORTER, in uniform, moves to Joseph. Burt stands nearby, proud: 
YOUNG POLICE REPORTER Captain Grusinsky, hi! I'm Officer Timpanaro from SPRING 3100, the police magazine-- 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY How you doing... 
The Reporter reads his question off a small pad.      (VERY important that he come off like an amateur.) 
YOUNG POLICE REPORTER So: um, you are now the third-- 
Someone hits his arm.     He drops his pad, picks it up. 
YOUNG POLICE REPORTER (CONT'D) The third youngest captain on the Force, and our P.B.A. readers'll wanna know just how that, um-- (looks at his pad) --Feels! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY Feels like nothin'. Nah, it feels good! I love trying to, you know, help make the City safer for people and everything... 
ACROSS THE ROOM: 
Bobby and Rosario come down the stairs. Bobby immediately SEES his family, though they don't see him yet. To Rosario, quiet: 
BOBBY GREEN That's them there. In the corner. Lookit `em--two peas in a pod. 
ROSARIO DIAZ Yeah--I see `em! They don't look that bad though, you know? For cops? (re: Michael, Jack) Who're those other guys? 
BOBBY GREEN [My] Father's friends--they were all in Korea together. (with a laugh) Biggest bunch of fuckin' stiffs... (moves closer) Look, don't talk to nobody, we'll get out quicker. 
ROSARIO DIAZ (beat; darkening) I ain't gonna embarrass you. 
BOBBY GREEN N--I just wanna get out quick, that's all... 
ACROSS THE ROOM 
Bobby approaches, looks over to Sandra. The two nod an AWKWARD HELLO. Then the two brothers meet. We SEE the relationship between them. Strained, but a warmth deep UNDERNEATH: 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY Bobby, hey! You, you got off work and everything-- 
BOBBY GREEN Yeah I did so...congratulations... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SIMULTANEOUS: Burt motions to JACK, MICHAEL.      The two WALK UPSTAIRS. Burt steps forward. 
BURT GRUSINSKY Hello. 
BOBBY GREEN Pop. (Rosario moves near) Everybody, this is my girlfriend. Rosario. 
ROSARIO DIAZ Nice to meet you! 
BOBBY GREEN This's my brother. And my father. 
Burt and Joseph take one look at her and respond with subdued "hellos." She is not exactly, well, PROPER- LOOKING. And she isn't white. She picks up on this, tries to act as though she doesn't care. Burt turns to Bobby: 
BURT GRUSINSKY We gotta talk to you. Alone. 
ANGLE ON BOBBY. This gives him pause, but Rosario gives him a slight nod of her head, assuring him it's okay. So: 
INT. CHURCH - UPSTAIRS 
Jack and Michael are walking through the seemingly empty main hall of the church. Looking for anyone who may be hanging out, ducking in and around. They spot a COUPLE, making out in one of the pews. The man is shirtless, the woman in her bra. Caught, they let out an embarrassed CHUCKLE. With offense, but also humor: 
MICHAEL SOLO In a house of God, no less? C'mon, get up... 
The couple sheepishly exits the room, pulling on their clothes. As they do, they pass: Bobby, Burt, and Joseph coming up the stairs. Joseph pulls up the rear, standing behind his father. Bobby sees Jack and Michael, now seated several rows back. BEAT, then: 
MICHAEL SOLO (CONT'D) Hello, Bobby. Nice suit you got on. 
Bobby gladly gives a nod of recognition, sits down in an empty front pew. Burt brushes lint off his son's shoulder: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BURT GRUSINSKY Your hair's long. 
Joseph lingers, leaves. Father and son. ALONE. Then, staring straight ahead as he takes a drag of his cigarette: 
BOBBY GREEN Congratulations. You got me up here. 
BURT GRUSINSKY I knew you wouldn't help us. I told your brother, I said, `no point even bringing him down here.' 
BOBBY GREEN Good.   Then now you know. 
Bobby starts to leave.   Burt grabs his arm: 
BURT GRUSINSKY Hold on a second--lemme ask you a question. That girl of yours downstairs--she Puerto Rican? 
BOBBY GREEN Yeah.   I like the dark meat. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (5) 
BURT GRUSINSKY She hooking you up? 
BOBBY GREEN (lets out a chuckle) Why, you want some? 
BURT GRUSINSKY Yeah, keep laughing--your mother, rest in peace, I think she was too easy on you. 
BOBBY GREEN I gotta go, Pop. I'll see you `round. 
Bobby turns his back on Burt, getting up to walk downstairs. Burt remains emotional, reaching out to his son when Bobby is not looking, lowering it to no avail. 
INT. BASEMENT 
The music is off now. Bobby comes down, Burt follows. Joseph is getting something whispered in his ear by another cop. A squat man with a bad toupee starts to speak: NYPD Deputy Commissioner SPIRO GIAVANNIS. 
SPIRO GIAVANNIS Everyone?   Everyone! 
Rosario is leaning up against a post, drinking, watching the party. She stares down a GUY who OGLES HER LASCIVIOUSLY. With a sense of humor, she winks at him: 
ROSARIO DIAZ You take a picture, it'll last longer. 
Bobby approaches Rosario, grabs her hand: 
BOBBY GREEN C'mon, let's get outta here, [we'll] go party with Jumbo. 
He tugs her away.   She stops him.   With assurance: 
ROSARIO DIAZ We could stay if you want, baby. They don't like me, I don't care-- you're better than them anyway-- 
BOBBY GREEN (waves her off) We're goin'. C'mon. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She hurriedly puts down her drink. Joe stands near Spiro, but his attention is on his brother: 
SPIRO GIAVANNIS I'm Deputy Commissioner Spiro GIAVANNIS-- 
APPLAUSE.    Bobby, Rosario move to the exit.   SIMULTANEOUS: 
SPIRO GIAVANNIS (CONT'D) You know, we look around in these troubled times, and in moments like this we need leaders, men and women who can bring order back to our great communities. We're here this holiday season to give thanks for one of these men, our Russian brother, Joseph Grusinsky. 
CHEERS.   Joseph smiles, waves.   Filled with hubris. 
SPIRO GIAVANNIS (CONT'D) ...Joseph, many of us've known your father, Deputy Chief Burt Grusinsky, for many years, and I know he wants to say a little something. Chief? 
APPLAUSE for Burt, who waves, steps up: 
BURT GRUSINSKY Thank you. You know, I used to tell my kids, "work first, play later," and my son Joseph really took it to heart. He's been a real fighter over the years... He overcome his mother's passing, and the dyslexia--eventually wound up graduating John Jay as salutatorian and distinguished himself many times. (turns to Joseph) Anyway, you've shown yourself to be very brave and selfless, and I'm just, I'm very proud here tonight. 
BIG APPLAUSE as JOSEPH STEPS FORWARD. BOBBY AND ROSARIO squeeze through the crowd, to the stairs. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY Thank you everybody for coming-- happy Thanksgiving. Before I say anything else... We got some bad news this morning. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) One of our Irish brothers was killed in the line of duty last night--detective Edward Conlon was gunned down serving a warrant on Northern Boulevard. The clock's about to strike ten, so I thought we might give a moment of silence to remember. 
BOBBY STOPS. Instinctively, he turns back to the room, motions to Rosario to stop. Out of respect. She does. Then: the CHURCH BELL rings. TEN TIMES. Silence. The BELL GONGS. The CAMERA DOLLIES PAST: JOSEPH and his family, and JACK, and MICHAEL, then past ROSARIO, and BURT, and BOBBY. The bell stops. The SEA of BLUE, the POLICE, genuflect. Our characters do not. Instead, BOBBY STARES at JOSEPH AND BURT across the crowded room. They return the glare, and Bobby exits... 
EXT. QUEENS STREET - FRONT OF AN APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
The camera TILTS UP to an apartment window.   We CUT INSIDE: 
INT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM 
MUSIC UP: PRINCE'S "HOUSEQUAKE." Hot girls and flashy- looking guys. The men are drinking. The women make themselves up en masse in front of a large mirror over the sofa. A couple KISSES in the corner. Everyone's getting ready for a night of revelry on the town. They are SINGING, having a GREAT TIME. The decor is late `70's, though not exaggeratedly so. DRUGS are EVERYWHERE. We MOVE PAST THIS TO: 
INT. BOBBY'S BEDROOM 
PAN around the ROOM: a set of weights on the carpeted floor, with clothes scattered everywhere; on the wall, a Jets football schedule, a Led Zeppelin poster. Bobby is PRIMPING in the mirror. Rosario stands on Bobby's king bed, DANCING SENSUALLY to the music in a state of partial undress. She MOVES with great FREEDOM, puffing on a JOINT. 
ROSARIO DIAZ I'm gonna be like Madonna. You think I'm like Madonna...? 
Bobby sees Rosario in the reflection; his face lights up. 
ROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D) We're both Leos, you know. 
BOBBY GREEN You're just like her, baby... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Bobby opens his top drawer to get a watch. REVEALS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS in CASH, hidden underneath a fake drawer bottom. Traces his fingers across the money with private pride, then puts on the watch. Rosario bounces down on the bed. Reaching under the bed sneakily, she pulls out a small box. She hides it. Then: 
JACK SHAPIRO What if your brother's inside? 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY It's his day off. He ain't gonna be there. 
Joseph clicks his weapon into place. 
MICHAEL SOLO What if he is?    We still go? 
Joseph is deeply troubled by the prospect. 
MICHAEL SOLO (CONT'D) What's it gonna be? 
ANGLE ON JOSEPH. 
EXT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB 
Mob scene.    Bobby and Rosario and Louis and the gang enter. 
INT. EL CARIBE - CLUB ENTRANCE 
Bobby gleefully shakes hands upon entering, then splits from the group. Rosario joins several girls as they fix themselves up in front of large lobby mirrors... 
INT. MARAT'S APARTMENT - FOYER/LIVING ROOM 
Opening the door is Kalina, who embraces him.   In Russian: 
KALINA BUZHAYEV (SUBTITLE) Bobby! Our daughter and her husband Eli come by for dinner. You want something, some tea? 
BOBBY GREEN No no, I'm all right... Hi everybody... 
A grown woman, Marat's daughter MASHA, waves while sifting through a stack of FURS on the sofa. One of her young children, a daughter, holds her hand. 
INT. DINING ROOM 
Marat sits at the head of a table with lots of FOOD (including a HUGE SMOKED FISH) on it. He waves Bobby over, ebullient. ELI MIRICHENKO, Masha's husband, is seated here, too--trying to talk to his young toddler SON. Bobby sits down, next to Marat. 
BOBBY GREEN Everything's really rockin' tonight. Line's halfway `round the block. 
MARAT BUZHAYEV Yes, it's good... 
The toddler runs to Bobby. Bobby lifts the youngster onto his knee; as he bounces the child on his knee, he turns back to Marat: 
BOBBY GREEN You wanted to talk to me? 
Marat nods, waves to Kalina for drinks. 
MARAT BUZHAYEV You know, maybe we open another spot next year. Across from Brighton. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOBBY GREEN 'S a good move. 
MARAT BUZHAYEV We need someone in charge here full- time, then. And we think you do a great job. 
BOBBY GREEN I appreciate that. You know, I been thinking `bout it--I'd like to become a partner here too--buy in with you. (BEAT) I mean, I got a lot of ideas. 
KALINA BUZHAYEV (SUBTITLE) (EXCITED) Already! He's got so many ideas! 
BOBBY GREEN Well, I just think we could do more. Maybe expand into Sheepshead Bay. I know a good spot--we add a restaurant there, get the spill- over. Like what your brother did, in Miami. 
Marat nods, considering this. Reaches to the FISH. He takes the EYE out of the fish and starts to suck on it. Daughter Masha stands behind her seated husband, holding and bouncing her little girl. ELI antes up, to Marat: 
ELI MIRICHENKO That's gonna take a lot of money, Papa. Your fur business can support that right now? 
Marat waves him off.    Turns back to Bobby, re Eli: 
MARAT BUZHAYEV My son-in-law, he worries people take advantage of me. 
BOBBY GREEN I can understand that. But I got money to invest--we could make it something real special over there. Do what I did downstairs--you know, bring in name DJs on different nights? (BEAT) What do you think? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
Marat grins from ear to ear.   Excitedly, he nods.   Then: 
MARAT BUZHAYEV Yes. Together we do it. You come to our Thanksgiving again, on Thursday? 
BOBBY GREEN Yeah, sure.   I'll come. 
MARAT BUZHAYEV Good--we talk more, at the dinner. 
The two hug. Bobby is being shown out by Kalina, and is about to depart when Buzhayev calls to his wife in Russian: 
MARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D) Give him, for tonight! 
She reaches for her purse.   But Bobby refuses graciously, waving it off as he exits: 
BOBBY GREEN Nah nah, no thank you... 
INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - MAIN ROOM 
A LARGE NEON SUN is lowered from the top of the theater. Sitting on it, singing: `80's POP STAR TAYLOR DANE. The CROWD GOES NUTS. As this happens: BOBBY ENTERS, sits down at a table against the back wall. Louis is next to him. 
LOUIS FALSETTI My brother! How'd it go? (Bobby smiles, winks) Ho, well! I'm guessing it went pretty good then! 
BOBBY GREEN Listen--I get this done, I want you to be a host. In one of our spots. 
BURT GRUSINSKY Don't EVER speak to me like that again. You hear me? I'll rap you right in the mouth! 
BOBBY GREEN You fuckin' touch me!? You gonna fuckin' touch me?!? 
Bobby COCKS HIS FIST. BUT BURT IS READY. A STANDOFF. Then Bobby decides against it, bolts. On BURT as we GO TO: 
INT. MARAT'S APARTMENT - DAY 
BOBBY ENTERS. Packed with people. A family get-together for Thanksgiving. Children abound, a PARTY atmosphere. BOBBY is in the FOYER, holding a cake he's brought. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Several FURS laid out on a felt-covered bench. Into the LIVING ROOM, he sees Masha and ELI seated on the couch, holding the hand of their son, who is dressed in a striped suit. Upon seeing Bobby, ELI NODS TO HIM and Masha enters the foyer, greeting Bobby with a kiss on both cheeks and taking the wrapped present from him. 
INT. DINING ROOM 
Bobby enters. Sitting at the large table is MARAT, playing with one of his grandchildren. Bobby knocks on the doorframe to announce his entrance. When Buzhayev spots him, the child hides behind Marat's leg. Marat lets out a laugh at this; to the child: 
MARAT BUZHAYEV No no--it's okay. Say hello... 
The boy waves perfunctorily. 
MARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D) Now--we go this week to the field, okay? To ride the horses? Go to Mama. 
Marat addresses the boy clutching his leg (AD-LIB a Russian "go"), kisses him, and the child runs off. Bobby steps closer to Marat: 
BOBBY GREEN Mr. Buzhayev... I'm real sorry about what happened the other night. (BEAT) [If] I was working, maybe I would've been able to do something, but... Anyway, I'm sorry. 
MARAT BUZHAYEV It's not your fault... 
Marat darkens considerably. More interior tone, almost as much for himself as for Bobby: 
MARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D) You can't always control everyone in your family... (BEAT) My nephew, he don't come back to the club anymore. 
Marat brings his hand to his head, looks pained. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOBBY GREEN You don't mind my saying, I think that's probably the right thing to do. (BEAT) Things get back to normal, I'm hoping we could get started on what we talked about. 
MARAT BUZHAYEV (shakes his head) We need time for the bad publicity to go away. 
BOBBY GREEN Mr. Buzhayev, my getting arrested ain't gonna be a problem. I don't got a record-- 
With great effort, Marat stands. 
MARAT BUZHAYEV I know.   I don't worry about any of that. 
He puts his arm around Bobby's shoulder. 
MARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D) I used to teach chemistry before I come over here, and now I have the fur store, and this. One thing I learned here, you can always start over. So don't worry--someday, we do it. Okay? Someday. 
BOBBY GREEN Yeah...   All right... 
KALINA BUZHAYEV (O.C.; SUBTITLE) Food is ready! 
Marat looks at Bobby with great sympathy as they walk toward the LIVING ROOM. 
MARAT BUZHAYEV You take some time off, everything will be fixed in a little bit. Then you come back. I pay you for the time. Come on... 
Bobby mutters a "THANK YOU." Buzhayev touches his cheek. Marat then turns back into THE DINING ROOM, spreading his arms affectionately and wide, yelling "OHHH" to the children as they cheer. ANGLE ON BOBBY as we GO TO: 
INT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - UPSTAIRS OFFICE 
Present: Joseph, Michael, Jack. Joe's seated at the head of a long table, which is covered with coffee, deli sandwich remnants, and police reports, etc. They are working; we greet them in media res. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY He stabbed himself, he was a bundle guy. Mighta known how they're movin' it. See, that's the key-- 
ALL OF A SUDDEN, IN COMES BOBBY.   Intense beat.    Finally: 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) We waited `til it was your day off. (BEAT) We had to go--I'm sorry. 
Beat.   Bobby takes a step toward him: 
BOBBY GREEN You had to hit that spot. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY Nezhinski was seen there, Bobby! What am I supposed to do--announce it in advance, compromise the whole thing? (BEAT) C'mon. 
BOBBY GREEN I had plans down there. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY Yeah, well, I tried. What do you want from me, anyway? You know, you're standing there feeling sorry for yourself, but you wouldn't be in this shit if you didn't fuck around in the first place. 
BOBBY GREEN You got real balls saying that to me. I made something for myself, and you come in and fuck it up? Just `cause I'm not trying to be like you? And Pop-- 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY Bobby, you're the one acting like you're above it all all the time! (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) Fuckin' around with your little Puerto Rican all day-- 
BOBBY GREEN What did you call her? 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY You heard me. Have some fucking class for once. 
Bobby takes another confrontational step forward.       Raging: 
BOBBY GREEN You piece of shit... 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (ignoring him) [You] go around like you're a big shot... You're a joke! Grow up already! Fuckin' loser... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
STOCKY LATINO MAN Call. 
Bobby takes a SHOT OF LIQUOR.    Turns over his cards.    He has a pair of QUEENS: 
BOBBY GREEN Siegfried and Roy, baby! Two fucking queens! 
STOCKY LATINO MAN Goddamnit! 
A pair of tens. Bobby stands, CLAPS ONCE.       Lou, thrilled, jumps up and HUGS Bobby. 
LOUIS FALSETTI Bobkes, I love you! 
Rosario has a slightly serious look on her face as she calls out to Bobby: 
ROSARIO DIAZ Bobby--it's for you! 
BOBBY GREEN Who is it? 
She shakes her head as if to say, "I don't know." Slightly peeved that he needs to attend to the call, he leaves the table. As he does so, Louis, to some girl, proudly: 
LOUIS FALSETTI I was the one told him to keep goin'! 
Then Louis grabs the pot for himself as Bobby picks up the phone, several feet away from the ruckus. He covers his free ear with his hand to hear better: 
BOBBY GREEN Hello? 
MICHAEL SOLO (PHONE FILTER) Bobby, it's Michael Solo--I got some bad news. (BEAT) Your brother's been shot. He's at St. John's--they're workin' on him now. I just thought you should know. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
Bobby, of course, is stunned. The poker table in the background is a riot, a contrast to the sober message Bobby's getting. He turns his back to the crowd; sotto: 
BOBBY GREEN Is--is he gonna be all right? 
MICHAEL SOLO Listen, your father's coming--I gotta go. But he's at St. John's. 
HANG UP. Bobby waits a beat, frozen, then does the same. Rosario knows something is wrong, approaches him. 
ROSARIO DIAZ Bobby? 
BOBBY GREEN My brother was shot...they're operating on him now. 
Rosario sees how remote he is, what a blow it is.     She pulls him to her: 
ROSARIO DIAZ You gotta go see him--be there for him and your father. 
Bobby eyes her, walks to the table.      A CLOSE SHOT on him. 
BOBBY GREEN Game's over, everybody. 
STOCKY LATINO MAN What, you shuttin' it down?!? 
BOBBY GREEN That's right.    I gotta go. 
LOUIS FALSETTI Bobkes--?   What's wrong? 
STOCKY LATINO MAN Fuck you, man!    We're in deep here! 
Bobby grabs his coat. Rosario responds in kind, moves to Bobby. He spins to her. In hushed tones: 
BOBBY GREEN What're you doing? 
ROSARIO DIAZ I wanna come too. For you-- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
BOBBY GREEN No--it's gonna be a fuckin' scene. I'll call you later. 
ROSARIO DIAZ BOBBY-- 
BOBBY GREEN Don't argue. 
Bobby moves to Louis: 
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) Louis, lock up and take her home. 
LOUIS FALSETTI (confused, he nods) Sure, Bob. Everything cool? 
Hurt, Rosario spins around and enters Bobby's room, closing the door behind her. 
BOBBY GREEN Yeah, no--I just remembered I gotta do something, that's all-- 
Pats Louis' arm as if to reassure him. Then the Latino Man tries to grab some of the pot. OTHER PLAYERS REVOLT: 
OTHER PLAYERS Hey--HEY!     What the fuck?!? 
A FIGHT BREAKS OUT. Louis moves over to the WOMEN, holding them back (odd--they weren't going anywhere to begin with): 
LOUIS FALSETTI Take it easy, TAKE IT EASY! Calm down and everything'll be, uh, non compos mentis! 
PUSHING, SHOVING. PUNCHING. Bobby exits his place, leaving behind Rosario and Louis and chaos... 
SANDRA GRUSINSKY It's okay. 
Bobby walks toward the entrance.   Stops.    Sandra seems to read his mind, speaks: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SANDRA GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) He's alone. Your father just left for the precinct. 
Bobby nods subtly, mouths a "THANK YOU." The Guards step aside. He walks to the doors. Pauses. ENTERS: 
INT. WARD 
Joseph's bed is in the back of the large space. His face is blocked by hospital curtains. Bobby steps forward. 
Slowly, he walks to his brother's bed. He peels away the CURTAIN. Looks at JOSEPH'S FACE. Joseph's visage is completely RAVAGED on the left side, covered with bandages that are soaked with blood. A TERRIBLE IMAGE. The emotion surges within him; he's HEARTBROKEN. 
It is a surprisingly painful moment. We can TELL he didn't expect this level of destruction. His mouth drops open slightly. Joseph's eyes open just a bit but don't look at Bobby. Bobby slowly lifts his fingers, touches Joe's arm gently. His fingers move down to his brother's hand. Joseph is unresponsive but conscious. All of a sudden: 
NURSE Sir...? 
Joseph's hand closes around Bobby's fingers. The connection is huge. Bobby's eyes well up, and he rubs them, almost ashamed of the emotion. It is a shocking OUTPOURING of FEELING from him. 
He leans over haltingly, kisses his brother's forehead: 
NURSE (CONT'D) Sir, I'm sorry--I.C.U. visiting hours are over. 
He waits a beat. The Nurse gently pulls his shoulder. He backs away, his eyes reddened. The camera MOVES INTO a CLOSE SHOT on BOBBY as we GO TO: 
INT. TENEMENT - HALLWAY 
A loud, active hallway of a housing project. Graffiti on the walls, trash on the floor, but FULL OF LIFE. 
Bobby emerges from the elevator, emotionally distraught. He SEES, in one far corner of the hall, two young Latino teens smoking CRACK. 
He goes to one of the apartment doors, KNOCKS.    Opening the door is a LATE MIDDLE-AGED LATINO WOMAN. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Behind her, is ROSARIO. (The woman who answers the door is clearly Rosario's mother.) 
INT. ROSARIO'S APARTMENT - FOYER 
Rosario's mother discreetly backs away from the door. He and Rosario stare at each other for a moment. Bobby gropes for words. His emotions bubble up inside of him; then, barely audible, his voice cracking: 
BOBBY GREEN ...Feels like it was my fault... 
He sinks down, holding her tight, his head at her stomach. She gently strokes his hair, kissing the top of his head. 
She shakes her head to reassure him, whispering "no...no...". In this moment, he needs her. In this moment, he is like a twelve year-old boy... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CAFE CAPPUCCINO - BRIGHTON AVENUE - NIGHT 
Across from the El Caribe. It's like a scene out of Balm in Gilead here--raucous clubgoers are eating burgers and drinking coffee after their nights on the town. Bobby and Rosario and Louis sit at one of the tables. Bobby kisses Rosario on her forehead as she reaches into her purse. She looks through a small ziplock bag with a vial of cocaine. Louis, meanwhile, is unaware of Bobby's state of mind, and is busy putting on a show--as usual: 
LOUIS FALSETTI Where'd you run off to, like a Jew? You got outta there, it became like a real zoo. The spics-- (looks to Rosario) `Scuse me--the P.R.s, they're goin' nuts for the money--picka picka picka picka--and the girls, they're screamin', and I'm keepin' everybody in line. I'm fuckin' bustin' heads, like Bruce Lee--I'm fuckin' bustin' heads-- 
He gets up and starts kicking and chopping in the air in the clumsiest manner possible. Accidentally kicks the waitress, who's bringing the check. 
LOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D) Oh, `scuse me, sorry about that. 
Bobby picks up the check, hands Louis some cash. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOBBY GREEN Hercules, do me a favor--before you kill a waitress, go pay the check. 
LOUIS FALSETTI Arright. But I'll tell you Bobkes, nobody else could ever do for you what I did. 
Louis smiles, walks off.    Scoops up the tip from a nearby table. 
BOBBY GREEN Don't tell Louis nothing about what happened. Far as he knows, my family moved away, [a] long time ago. 
ROSARIO DIAZ I ain't ever gonna say nothing! I just thought...maybe he could cheer you up a little. 
Bobby kisses her atop her head. JUST THEN: VADIM AND HIS GANG enter the establishment. They create a ruckus. Spotting Bobby and Rosario, Vadim ambles toward them: 
VADIM NEZHINSKI Hey, look who's here! 
ROSARIO DIAZ Hey Vadim... (as Vadim approaches) We were just gettin' something to eat. 
VADIM NEZHINSKI (nods; to Bobby:) You make it through that bust okay? 
Bobby gives a simple nod as well. Inside, Bobby is extremely uneasy, though outwardly he is quietly confident: 
BOBBY GREEN I didn't have nothing on me. 
VADIM NEZHINSKI Glad to hear it. 
Without making eye contact, Bobby shrugs; then: 
BOBBY GREEN Your uncle's got some problems now, though. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
A large room, lit by fluorescents. Mostly empty of furniture in the center, with vending machines against the wall and a sole IBM PC in a corner. A huge GUN RACK is on the wall, conspicuous, a hint perhaps of the violence to come. It is Bobby and Burt, Jack and Michael. Bobby's been telling his story. He and Burt are seated--Jack looks out the small window in the door, then turns the LOCK for privacy; and a nervous Michael is pacing: 
MICHAEL SOLO Nezhinski got a hit list? On us?!? 
Bobby looks at his father, then nods.      Mouths an almost INAUDIBLE: 
BOBBY GREEN Yeah... 
Michael purses his lips, then spins around to Burt. 
MICHAEL SOLO We gotta go bust `em, Burt--right now. 
ANGLE ON BURT.    He betrays no hint of concern: 
BURT GRUSINSKY No. They'll be back on the street in a day. We gotta try and catch `em with their hands full--find out where they got the real weight. Then we can move. 
MICHAEL SOLO That could take us forever! 
BURT GRUSINSKY Doesn't matter. It's our only play. 
Uncustomarily, Jack speaks: 
JACK SHAPIRO I say we go hit `em all. Wipe `em out, suicide-by-cop-- 
BURT GRUSINSKY What're you talkin' about?! C'mon, don't be a first-class schmuck! (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JACK SHAPIRO But we don't got the time to infiltrate `em-- 
Burt lets his temper flare; briefly, we SEE a more mature version of Bobby: 
BURT GRUSINSKY Then we make the time! (to Mike, Bobby) Look, I want you all to understand something--we don't ever play in the dirt here, okay? Not ever, no matter what! (BEAT) You piss in your pants, you only stay warm for so long. 
MICHAEL SOLO What about callin' in the Feds? They got a lot more juice than we DO-- 
BURT GRUSINSKY Bunch of college boys from Kansas. We protect our own here. 
Bobby sees an opening: 
BOBBY GREEN Pop, Nezhinski's been talkin' about a shipment he's got comin'. Maybe that's how you get to him. 
MICHAEL SOLO How you know about that, Bobby? 
BOBBY GREEN (somewhat sheepish) They been wanting me to buy in for a while. 
Michael turns to the others.    Brightening: 
MICHAEL SOLO Well, maybe that's it, then. If we can get him-- (re: Bobby) To set something up, maybe one of our uncles could move in-- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
JACK SHAPIRO (pointing to Bobby; with some ridicule) It'd have to be him-- 
BURT GRUSINSKY Forget it, both of you. 
BOBBY GREEN What do you mean, set something up? 
BURT GRUSINSKY BOBBY-- 
MICHAEL SOLO You'd go set up a buy with `em, just like they've been asking you to. We follow you to the spot, bust `em a week later. That way, your name's clean, nobody knows you're involved-- 
BURT GRUSINSKY That's too dangerous for him! We don't know how solid his cover is out there! (to Bobby) That girlfriend of yours, she knows about you, right? So can we just get back to the discussion please? 
A beat.   Bobby is dead serious: 
BOBBY GREEN Pop? 
BURT GRUSINSKY What? 
BOBBY GREEN You could trust her. 
BURT GRUSINSKY Good. I'm glad. But it's not happening. So forget it. 
BOBBY GREEN But...but you could get killed-- 
BURT GRUSINSKY Don't worry about me, just worry about yourself, arright? Anything happens with your brother I'll call you. Goodbye. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
A beat.   Bobby is still there, fixated. 
BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) Goodbye! 
Finally, Bobby exits.   We GO TO: 
INT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Bobby enters his room, which is dark. Rosario is here, asleep. Her back to Bobby. Upon hearing him enter, she turns and looks at him (and US) in SLOW MOTION... 
Bobby sits on the edge of the bed, touches her back. She senses something wrong and speaks, voice ravaged by sleep: 
ROSARIO DIAZ Everything okay? (BEAT) They said on the television your brother was doing better. 
Bobby nods. 
ROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D) Me and my mother, we said a prayer for him. 
Bobby takes the BEEPER.     Michael touches his shoulder: 
MICHAEL SOLO (CONT'D) Just be smart about things. Okay? You get burnt and we gotta put you in protection, it's still better than winding up dead. An informant dies, they talk about you for a day. A week later, ain't no one remembers your name. (BEAT) Moral of the story is, don't die. You understand? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
ANGLE ON BOBBY as he sobers.   Nods.   Then: 
BOBBY GREEN You need to promise me something, though. You won't investigate my girlfriend--she's, she don't know any better. 
MICHAEL SOLO She won't be a target. Just make sure she don't open her mouth. 
BOBBY GREEN I'll take care of it. 
Michael grabs Bobby's shoulder, a gesture of affection. 
MICHAEL SOLO You know we known you your whole life, kid? Good luck. 
INT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - LATER 
Bobby enters the bedroom. Presses his answering machine button, and a message begins to play. It is Rosario. 
ROSARIO DIAZ'S VOICE Hi, Bobby. It's me. Just wanted to see how you were doing--I guess you're at the hospital now... I hope your family's doing good... Okay, I love you... Jumbo says hello too... 
As her voice plays on the machine: he moves to the dresser, where he opens the top drawer. INSIDE: THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS--his SAVINGS. He begins to take the money out of the drawer and count it when: we HEAR a SOFT BUZZ. He quickly looks over, CHECKS THE BEEPER. He stares at the paged number... 
EXT. FLUSHING MEADOW PARK - FOGGY DUSK 
A MAN #1 stands by a bench, almost floating in the fog. He is stocky, dressed in a down vest. Bobby enters the frame, trepidatious; he and the man eye each other for a moment, then Bobby holds out the beeper. The man takes it. 
MAN #1 takes out A KEL DEVICE LISTENING UNIT and its accessories. Among them, a CIGARETTE LIGHTER. He UNSCREWS THE LIGHTER. Complex electronic innards. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN #1 Your wire's in here--we're gonna follow the signal. Find the stash house and make the deal, you leave the rest to us. 
BOBBY GREEN You gonna leave me all alone out there? 
MAN #1 (shrugs; then) I ain't gonna lie to you.   There's always a risk. 
Man #1 hands Bobby the LIGHTER.    He FIRES it.    It works. 
MAN #1 (CONT'D) Your cover's blown, call for help-- don't try and be a hero. Just get outta the way--place could turn into a butcher shop. Talk about pussy--that'll be our signal to come in early. 
BOBBY GREEN You come up with that one all by yourself? 
MAN #1 (ignores the joke) Just do the deal and get out. Bear in mind, your life is in that lighter. Anything goes wrong, the department'll get word to your father. 
The Man unceremoniously turns to leave.     Then, suddenly: 
MAN #1 (CONT'D) And oh--G.Q. told me to tell you-- your brother's coming along real good. They reset his jaw and sometimes he's awake. 
Bobby acknowledges that with a single nod of his head. The man departs. Bobby grasps the lighter tight, looks at the man as he virtually disappears back into the fog... 
INT. CHURCH - EARLY EVENING 
It is an older Catholic church, a beautiful interior. A line of young Latino women hold candles, singing as they walk toward the altars. A HEALING MASS. Rosario is here. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She lights a candle at the altar, then walking back to the pew, she SEES BOBBY and approaches. Bobby looks around, seeming harried and paranoid... 
ROSARIO DIAZ Bobby--what're you doing here? 
Bobby looks at her, his eyes filled with emotion. 
BOBBY GREEN I--I need to talk to you. 
ROSARIO DIAZ I'm coming home in a little bit. 
He doesn't respond at all. 
ROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D) Bobby? 
He appears almost in tears...    Finally, sotto: 
BOBBY GREEN I--I'm gonna inform. For the police. (BEAT) I'm gonna help `em set up Nezhinski. 
Rosario is shocked.     Almost inaudible: 
ROSARIO DIAZ What...? 
As she steps back, he moves forward: 
BOBBY GREEN I had to do it, Rosario. These motherfuckers--they were gonna come after my father. 
Rosario tries to recover.    Can barely speak.     Sotto: 
ROSARIO DIAZ But Nezhinski finds out, he'd kill YOU-- 
BOBBY GREEN He ain't ever gonna find out.    He ain't ever gonna know. 
ROSARIO DIAZ But what if something goes wrong? What's gonna happen to you?!? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
BOBBY GREEN I don't know... I'd, I'd probably have to go into protection. 
Bobby takes the front passenger seat.      Pavel is behind him. Someone we DON'T KNOW is driving. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Bobby is somewhat edgy, with Pavel behind him. The car pulls away from the curb. Then: Pavel throws a small towel over Bobby's head. POINTS A REVOLVER AT BOBBY'S TEMPLE. Bobby is startled by the action, blinded. Trying to stay calm... 
PAVEL LUBYARSKY Put your hands out, where I could see `em. 
BOBBY GREEN You know me. 
PAVEL LUBYARSKY Shut your fuckin' mouth and do it! 
Bobby obliges. The driver, looking anxiously in his rear view mirror, makes a SHARP LEFT, and the car VEERS. Pavel then PATS BOBBY DOWN, searching for a wire, anything incriminating. To the driver: 
PAVEL LUBYARSKY (CONT'D) Turn at the light... 
The CAR makes A SHARP LEFT.      In Russian, subtitled: 
PAVEL LUBYARSKY (CONT'D) Go left.    Again. 
EXT. STREET 
The Livery Car makes another brutal SHARP LEFT, tires screeching just slightly. 
INT. LIVERY CAR 
Pavel again: 
PAVEL LUBYARSKY'S VOICE Let's go.   No one's on us. 
The camera MOVES INTO a SHOT OF THE HOODED BOBBY... 
EXT. STREET 
The Livery Car pulls up to the curb. We are on: a strange residential street with tenements and graffiti everywhere. Dark, deserted. Many silhouetted figures stand in doorways up and down the block. They are all armed, with shotguns and machine guns slung over their shoulders. A GARBAGE CAN IS ON FIRE a few yards away. The men get out of the car. They pull Bobby out: 
INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY 
They walk up the stairs, PULLING Bobby up over the steps. He stumbles. They pick him up, lead him to a door. 
INT. TENEMENT - APARTMENT - FRONT ROOM 
Someone pulls the hood off him. Bobby looks around. The room is ABSOLUTELY BARE. The driver puts Bobby's bag of money down on the floor. A TEENAGED BOY wearing a SURGICAL MASK comes and puts one on Bobby's face as well. Bobby surveys the place. Where the hell is he? With that mask on his face, we HEAR his BREATHING, loud and present, through the sequence. 
It could be night or day, we wouldn't know. The windows are blocked with duct tape to obscure all light. There is VISQUINE hanging from seemingly everywhere. Parts of rooms are cordoned off with the material. SILHOUETTED FIGURES ROAM through the space like apparitions. A SLAVIC-LOOKING MAN takes Bobby's bag of money, leaves the room. 
IN THE HALLWAY 
Stands Pavel, masked as well, armed now with a Kalashnikov rifle. Without a word, he motions with a move of his head to Bobby. "FOLLOW ME," he seems to be saying. 
INT. BEDROOM 
Bobby enters the room, right behind Pavel. He SEES: a dresser with a clock on it and a small mirror. Tables set up in the middle of the room with brown jars on them. There is a television on in the corner, a Russian ethnic musical program silently unfolding. 
There are other people in the room: a BROWN-HAIRED MAN; and two dark-haired SLAVIC-LOOKING WOMEN. It's an assembly line for the preparation of narcotics. 
The SLAVIC MAN takes out the STACKS OF BILLS. Starts counting them methodically. Pavel motions to the Brown- Haired Man, puts up two fingers. 
On cue, the Brown-Haired Man rubs his hands together, then takes two large JARS from his desk. Beneath the desk, Bobby spots what looks like an ENORMOUS NUMBER of packages of NARCOTICS, stacked against the wall. 
This is clearly THEIR STASH HOUSE. The Brown-Haired Man pours powdery contents from a jar out onto his desk blotter. He sits down, takes off his jacket, REVEALING: TATTOOS, UP AND DOWN BOTH OF HIS ARMS. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
The designs combine several images--skulls, snakes, and the SPIDER WEB element that marked Vadim's own tattoo. 
He takes a RUSTY LETTER OPENER--it had been sitting atop the desk--and pierces a GREEN PACKAGE. White powder seeps from the package. 
Bobby watches from behind the mask as the man pushes and pulls what looks like pure cocaine in powder form. He uses two PLAYING CARDS to move the drug. Bobby eyes that RUSTY LETTER OPENER... 
The Brown-Haired Man dips a measuring spoon in another powder to add to the mix. He is cutting the drug. He continues to manipulate the substance, and his hands move with a kind of grace that one expects from a seasoned chef on a cooking show. 
CLOSE SHOT on some lines of COCAINE. Pavel takes a toot. He OFFERS it to Bobby as a taste. Bobby accepts. He pulls down his mask momentarily, RUBBING a RATHER LARGE QUANTITY OF THE DRUG ON HIS GUMS, HIS LIP. We HEAR: 
VADIM NEZHINSKI'S VOICE You needed to come here tonight...? 
Bobby looks over to see: EMERGING FROM THE BLACK, FROM DOWN A DARKENED HALLWAY: VADIM NEZHINSKI. Everyone is wearing a surgical mask--except, of course, for him. Bobby eyes him with eyes that seem to become more BLOODSHOT by the second. 
VADIM NEZHINSKI What's the matter, ain't Pavel good enough for you? 
BOBBY GREEN That's all the money I got.    And I ain't gonna leave it alone. 
The Slavic Youth finishes counting Bobby's cash: 
SLAVIC YOUTH It's all there.     Fifty grand. 
Vadim points to the MONEY: 
VADIM NEZHINSKI Where'd you get this? 
BOBBY GREEN From my savings. From El Caribe and Rasputin. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
VADIM NEZHINSKI (nods; then:) That buys you three keys in here. (BEAT) With the crack on the street, it's worth two hundred k. Maybe more. 
Bobby gets up, into a crouch, amidst the gunfire.    Dodging the bullets. 
An ESU Police Officer does not recognize Bobby as an ally, and he trains his assault rifle on Bobby. Bobby screams, his hands raised: 
BOBBY GREEN I'm with you!     I'm with YOU! 
This is INAUDIBLE, with all the ammo being dispensed, and Bobby knows it; so he dodges the Officer; the Officer begins to unload his weapon, getting CLOSER to BOBBY. 
AND CLOSER. 
AND CLOSER.     Bobby is about to be killed when: 
HE SEES HIS CHANCE. HE CHARGES BACKWARD. WITH FEROCIOUS DETERMINATION, HE THROWS HIMSELF OUT A NEARBY WINDOW. 
THE PANE SHATTERS. BOBBY TUMBLES THROUGH, HIS FACE AND BODY RIDDLED WITH SHARDS OF GLASS. 
EXT. TENEMENT 
Bobby FALLS roughly twenty feet through the air. His body tumbles upside-down, toward a wrought-iron FENCE that surrounds the base of the apartment building's side. 
Bobby HITS the FENCE. His LEG GETS CAUGHT on one of the small spikes. He SCREAMS as we GO BACK TO: 
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING 
Cop cars pull up by the dozen, from EVERYWHERE. Out of one comes BURT GRUSINSKY, carrying a shotgun. He charges right into the structure... 
INT. DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOM 
Nezhinski opens the window, about to go out onto the fire escape. A WARRANT UNIT OFFICER is below. Looks up: 
WARRANT UNIT OFFICER Halt!   Police! 
BEHIND HIM: 
JACK SHAPIRO Hold it right there! Hands on your head! 
VADIM SPINS AROUND.   FREEZES.   His hands are in the air. 
VADIM NEZHINSKI Don't shoot! 
Officers pour in, among them BURT. Cops forcefully push Vadim to the ground. Start to cuff him. Burt pulls Jack ASIDE: 
BURT GRUSINSKY Where's my goddamned kid?!? 
Jack is speechless--he doesn't know. (We SEE that Burt's question--revealing Bobby's identity--REGISTERS on VADIM'S FACE.) Vadim mutters, aloud but sotto, in Russian: 
VADIM NEZHINSKI (SUBTITLE) He is a dead man... 
OFFICERS (not comprehending) Shut up! Get down! 
Burt frantically PUSHES THROUGH THE CROWD OF COPS... 
EXT. TENEMENT - APARTMENT - ALLEYWAY 
Bobby is upside-down, hanging from the fence, but he is alert. Two members of the EMERGENCY SERVICES UNIT approach him. 
On sheer instinct alone, he starts to PULL his LEG off the small SPIKE, his teeth clenched. An ARMY of ESU TROOPS and PARAMEDICS come to BOBBY'S AID... (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOBBY is being lowered from the fence. An AMBULANCE ZOOMS UP the STREET, to the alley. Burt rushes to his son. Jack and Mike come right behind him. Bobby looks at his father, his face nicked by many small cuts from the glass. Sheepish, he cannot say a word and averts his father's gaze. 
BURT GRUSINSKY Jesus. 
EMERGENCY SERVICES GUY He's gonna be okay, Chief. (to others) Clear out! 
Burt eases when he hears this. They move Bobby toward the ambulance. Burt turns to Michael. Sotto: 
BURT GRUSINSKY You guys go on a bust like this and you don't tell me about it? You think I'm born yesterday? 
MICHAEL SOLO I guess we do. 
BURT GRUSINSKY You're a real comedian! He's gonna need to be in protection now! 
INT. AMBULANCE 
Bobby sits up on the stretcher as a MEDIC treats his leg. Burt approaches, watches for a moment. The Medic leaves the post for a moment, and the two are ALONE. Burt stares at his son, who finally speaks: 
BOBBY GREEN I'll be all right, Pop. 
BURT GRUSINSKY (shakes head; then:) Well, I guess I don't have a say in anything anymore. Anyway... You did it. You did it and it took real balls. (BEAT) But now you're burnt--and we gotta get you someplace safe, keep you under wraps for awhile. 
BOBBY GREEN I need you to get my girlfriend, Pop. I need her to come with me. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Burt is getting emotional, aware of how close his son came to death. Trying not to show it--and failing. 
BURT GRUSINSKY I'll get them to take care of that. Just go get yourself fixed up-- that's the most important thing. 
With that, the Medic returns, and with a heavy heart, Burt closes the ambulance door. Bobby is alone with the Medic for a moment in the back of the vehicle; he watches through the window as his father walks to his car. Bobby sinks to the cot, lies down. AS VADIM NEZHINSKI is LED AWAY in HANDCUFFS... 
BLACKNESS. 
FADE IN: 
A LOCAL NEWS CHANNEL: the STORY is about the BUST: MAJOR NARCOTICS SEIZURE, 40 KILOS OF COCAINE. An OFFICER is KILLED; Two PERPETRATORS (among them: PAVEL and the SLAVIC MAN) KILLED. Four others wounded. 
MORE THAN A DOZEN ARRESTS. We SEE the PERPS, lined up against the walls. VADIM NEZHINSKI'S MUG SHOT. We're told he's AWAITING TRIAL. In a RELATED STORY-- 
BOBBY GREEN I'm real glad you're home... 
The two separate, both smiling gently. Breaking the moment: (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SANDRA GRUSINSKY Everyone, let's, let's move inside-- there's plenty to eat! 
Soft laughter. Small talk begins. The group dissipates, moves to eat, etc. Burt moves to Joseph: 
BURT GRUSINSKY Joseph--we got some things we need to discuss, when you get the chance. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY We could do it now if you want, Pop. In the den. 
Burt nods, reluctantly. All our men walk to the den-- except for Bobby, who hears: ROSARIO, down the hall. She approaches him. 
ROSARIO DIAZ Bobby, I'm gonna go back to the motel. 
BOBBY GREEN What're you talking about? They got a lot of food over there--why don't you go eat something? 
ROSARIO DIAZ (shakes her head) N--I'm gonna go back. 
A beat. Bobby senses she's not completely right. Looks into her eyes, then, more an accusation than a question: 
BOBBY GREEN (WHISPERED) You fucked up? 
A muttered "no" from Rosario, hardly a committed denial. Before he can say anything, from the DEN, Burt peeks his head out: 
BURT GRUSINSKY Bobby--you should hear this too, for the trial. 
Burt motions for Bobby to enter the den.       Back to Rosario: 
BOBBY GREEN We gotta straighten this out later. 
Bobby then moves to the den. 
INT. JOSEPH'S HOUSE - DEN 
Burt and Joseph and Jack and Mike.    Bobby enters the room. As he does, we HEAR: 
MICHAEL SOLO Nezhinski's cache was huge, about 40 keys--yayo, some angel dust too. 
BURT GRUSINSKY We're gonna try and turn him, get him to tell us how they're bringing it in. But don't worry--we'll make sure he does plenty of time. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY He ain't gonna be reliable, Pop. 
Bobby closes the door behind him softly.       Joseph sees Bobby, is surprised he's here... 
BURT GRUSINSKY Well, you marry an ape, you don't complain about the stench of bananas. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY Where is he? 
JACK SHAPIRO He's at Rikers. Tucked in, nice and comfy. We're taking him to the A.D.A. next week, for a meeting. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY I wanna go with you on that. See his fuckin' face. 
Jack nods. 
MICHAEL SOLO I'll tell you, though--streets're dead. Junkies're waitin' out there for something big, no question. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY That's `cause we got their number one. Dried it up at the source. 
All of a sudden, a VOICE from behind: 
BOBBY GREEN That don't mean nothing. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Everyone turns around, slightly surprised Bobby's opened his mouth here: 
BURT GRUSINSKY What's that, Bobby? 
BOBBY GREEN There's a whole network full of suppliers. The organization goes deep. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY Bobby--you done a lot for us already. You don't gotta get involved in this anymore. Okay? 
BURT GRUSINSKY I asked him to come in, Joe. If he's gonna have to testify, he should know all this. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY This's police business, Pop--you gonna make him an honorary member of the Force now? 
An ugly beat.    Then: 
BOBBY GREEN I'll be outside if you need me. 
Bobby exits, and Burt watches him depart. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
The unaware crowd is having a great time. Children run around the rooms. Bobby SEES GUARD #2, approaches. Burt comes up next to him, takes him into a corner: 
BURT GRUSINSKY BOBBY-- (SOTTO) What was said in there, he--he didn't mean it. 
Bobby contemplates this; we SEE that he tacitly accepts his father's words. Then: 
BOBBY GREEN Well, why's he goin' back to work so soon, anyway? He ain't ready. 
(CONTINUED) 
Slight comfort. She nods. Bobby leans over, kisses her. He tenderly puts his hand on her face. She kisses his hand. Their GUARDS are WATCHING. She smiles, and that love returns: 
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) C'mon... Let's go back--this'll all be over soon. I promise... 
FADE OUT. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
FADE IN: 
EXT. OUTSIDE RIKER'S ISLAND PRISON - EARLY MORNING 
Vadim Nezhinski is being led, in handcuffs, into an unmarked Chevy. Both JOSEPH and Jack are here. Joseph and Vadim exchange looks as Vadim is placed into the back seat. Joe's expression is pure suppressed rage... 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY I'll go in the lead car. You stay with him `til we get to the A.D.A.'s. 
JACK SHAPIRO You got it... 
Joseph gets in his lead car, also an unmarked Chevy.    Both vehicles pull away from the curb... 
INT. STAIRWELL - OUTSIDE MARAT BUZHAYEV'S APARTMENT 
We SEE Bobby's ARMED GUARDS waiting on the steps.    TILT UP TO the closed door. Over this, we HEAR: 
MARAT BUZHAYEV (O.S.) We heard all about you in the news. We were all very sorry about your brother. 
INT. MARAT BUZHAYEV'S APARTMENT - RAINY DAY 
Bobby and Marat Buzhayev, inside the living room.   Bobby sits down, on the couch's armrest; Marat is in an easy chair, his lunch being served on a T.V. tray in front of him by his wife Kalina. The television plays a Russian movie, and Marat seasons his food. 
BOBBY GREEN Thank you... You know Mr. Buzhayev, I come to see you today `cause...with everything that's gone on, I don't think it's a good idea for me to stay in New York anymore. I was hoping maybe you could ask your brother if I could work with him, down in Miami. On his restaurant. 
MARAT BUZHAYEV I could talk to him. I think he would like you very much. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOBBY GREEN I'd appreciate it. 
Marat turns to Bobby, puts his hand on his knee. Emotional: 
MARAT BUZHAYEV We're going to be very sad if you're going. Having you here in this house meant a lot to us. You know, my wife and me, we have only daughters. 
BOBBY GREEN You always been very important to me too. (checks his watch) I should probably go now. 
MARAT BUZHAYEV Bobby--you'll always be welcome back here. 
Bobby is moved.    The two embrace. 
INT. VADIM'S COP CAR 
The car is moving. Jack is driving. Another cop is in the front passenger seat. Two other cops straddle Vadim. Silence, then, motioning toward Joseph's car: 
VADIM NEZHINSKI They did good.    On his face. 
JACK SHAPIRO Shut your fuckin' mouth. 
INT. JOSEPH'S CAR 
As Joseph looks back at Vadim's vehicle, behind him: 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY He makes a deal today, maybe my brother don't gotta take the stand... Least that's something... 
INT. VADIM'S COP CAR 
Jack puts a cigarette in his mouth, turns to the cop next to him: 
JACK SHAPIRO Give me that lighter. 
ALL OF A SUDDEN: (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
A VAN CROSSES THE LINE OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. COMES RIGHT TOWARD THEM, SLAMMING INTO PASSENGER'S SIDE. EXPLOSIVE. A THUNDERING SOUND, GLASS EVERYWHERE. THE COP IN THE PASSENGER'S SEAT FLIES RIGHT THROUGH THE FRONT WINDSHIELD. He's probably killed. 
INT. JOSEPH'S CAR 
The cops see this accident.     The DRIVER: 
DRIVER Holy shit! 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY Stop the fuckin' car! 
As Joseph PULLS OUT HIS GUN, READYING HIMSELF TO DO BATTLE, ANOTHER CAR PULLS IN BETWEEN THEM. AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE immediately pins Joseph and the other two police inside the vehicle. 
INT. VADIM'S COP CAR 
THREE MEN IN SKI MASKS emerge from the van, automatic WEAPONS IN HAND. JACK PULLS OUT HIS PIECE and immediately begins firing at them, using the wheel and dashboard as cover. He opens his door to slink out. 
VADIM HITS THE FLOOR. 
The other two officers are immediately riddled with GUNFIRE. 
Two of the men PULL VADIM toward them. The third man in a ski mask is hit by Jack's fire, but has just enough adrenaline to get into the SECOND CAR. 
IT SPEEDS AWAY. 
INT. BOBBY'S CAR 
Bobby and Rosario are in the back seat. She looks through her pocketbook for some gum, he remains focused on the view through the windshield of his father's car. 
Bobby's driver, Vitt, follows Burt down the streets. RAIN is FALLING frighteningly HARD, to the point where the windshield wipers aren't moving fast enough for the water on the windshield. Upsetting. Visibility's terrible. 
The cars swing onto the Kosciusko Bridge loop. The traffic is sparse this early morning. We HEAR the THUMPETY-THUMP of the bridge beams and the windshield wipers. And we HEAR the steady, haunting HUM of the bridge surface beneath the wheels of the automobiles. Bobby puts his arm around Rosario, in the back seat. Re the rain: 
BOBBY GREEN It's really coming down... 
ROSARIO DIAZ Bobby--I think I left my watch at the hotel-- 
Bobby does not answer, instead spots an OLDSMOBILE driving alongside his vehicle. Seems a bit suspicious, the way it's moving... 
BOBBY GREEN Hey--Vitt--I think somethin's on our right! 
VITT THE GUARD (TURNING) Huh--? 
A FLASH! 
CRACK! A BULLET punctures the windshield, but we don't HEAR the SHOT. The hole SEEMS TO APPEAR almost out of nowhere. The windshield cracks down the middle... VITT IS HIT in the SHOULDER, and he lets out a piercing cry. Blood hits the seat. Rosario screams. Bobby pushes her head down, into the back seat. 
THE CAR starts to swerve. Bobby climbs awkwardly over to the front seat. Takes the WHEEL, forcefully pulling Vitt to the side. To Rosario: 
BOBBY GREEN Get down! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Rosario crouches, covers the back of her head with her hands. THE WATER gets pushed away by the speedy wipers REVEALING: BURT'S CAR AND THE OLDSMOBILE HITTING EACH OTHER, SIDE TO SIDE; THEN, A HUBCAP--we don't know from which car it's been dislodged... 
COMES SPINNING AT INCREDIBLE SPEED. AT BOBBY'S WINDSHIELD. Right at BOBBY, RIGHT AT US. WE BLINK. Bobby swerves. THE HUBCAP SKIDS OFF the front windshield. Bobby brushes up against the guardrail. We SEE THAT IT is all that protects him from spinning off into the river, two hundred feet below. 
Bobby darts from lane to lane, and the THIRD POLICE CAR-- behind the Olds--has SLAMMED on its BRAKES to avoid hitting Bobby's car... 
THE OLDS IS RIGHT NEXT TO BURT'S CAR.      BOBBY SEES the barrel of the gun swing to Burt. 
ANOTHER BIG PUDDLE--A MUFFLED THUNDERCLAP sound... The water slides away, REVEALING that the back window of Burt's car has shattered. 
Bobby is startled at this, his mouth momentarily drooping open. He CAN SEE: 
HIS FATHER, FIRING his WEAPON out the window at the OLDS. We HEAR BURT through the RADIO, a STATIC-RAVAGED SIGNAL: 
BURT'S VOICE (RADIO FILTER) They got a hit on! Get support, now! 
Bobby pulls up alongside the Olds. Looks inside. He tries to get a good look but cannot. He SEES TWO people in the car, one driving and one doing the shooting-- 
BOOM!   And it punctures a hole in the side of Bobby's rear door.   Rosario is JOLTED--screams again... 
BOBBY GREEN Rosario!   You hurt? 
She shakes her head, her face still buried in the vinyl. She's hysterical--but physically unharmed. 
The traffic gets denser now. The WEATHER is terrible, blinding. Rushes of WATER COVER the glass around the car, wrecking visibility. We ARE ON: the B.Q.E., with many trucks, big and small, on it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
The Olds weaves in and out, in front of and behind, many large semis. BOBBY WATCHES AS: Burt's car is right behind the Olds. This is unbelievably dangerous. 
A TRUCK starts changing lanes. The Olds scoots past it before it does, but: Burt does not. THE TRUCK CLIPS Burt's car on the driver's side. He sneaks through, recovering and keeping up the pursuit. 
POLICE CARS, SIRENS BLAZING, JOIN THE PURSUIT... 
The truck starts to skid on the drenched roadway. Then: IT JACKNIFES, spinning out. The Police Car behind Bobby's slams into the truck, making a MACABRE CRUNCHING SOUND. 
BOBBY'S EYES, as he turns around and witnesses the horrific accident through the RAIN-SOAKED rear window. It is TERRIBLE: 
The truck CRUSHES the Police car, its carriage flipping over and flattening the vehicle and probably the people inside. 
The Olds skids ferociously, pulling off the expressway toward city streets. Burt's car follows. Burt's car and the Olds are neck-and-neck. Bobby pulls up beside Burt. Into the radio: 
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) Pop, lay back! 
But Burt does not. Burt has a clear shot at the hooded man in the back seat. HE FIRES. 
A HIT! We can see the BLOOD spatter the perp's automobile. The man's head jerks back spasmodically. We HEAR: 
BURT'S VOICE (RADIO FILTER) I got him!   I got the sonofabitch! 
AND THEN, CLOSE SHOT ON BOBBY: THREE QUICK CUTS, CLOSER AND CLOSER...SILENCE... He sees, through the rain: a LONG SHOTGUN BARREL come out of the window from the rear passenger's seat area. 
His eyes pop. The OLDS SPEEDS UP.    THE BARREL OF THE SHOTGUN turns: 
WATER covers the windshield, BLINDING the driver (and us). The water slides off the glass. 
THEN: A TERRIBLE THUNDERCLAP. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
BOBBY WATCHES as BLOOD COVERS BURT'S FACE. He's been HIT. He loses control of the automobile... Bobby freezes, IN DISBELIEF. IN HORROR. HIS FATHER HAS BEEN SHOT... 
EXT. STREET 
Through the RAIN, we SEE: a patch of parochial school children, ASIAN CHILDREN, on the streetcorner. 
BOBBY GREEN You gonna fuckin' catch these guys? 
A nod.   Bobby senses uncertainty: 
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) You ain't got nothing, do you. 
Michael looks to Jack, who steps forward: 
JACK SHAPIRO All our uncles on the street been hearing about a big deal, goin' down maybe Monday or Tuesday. (BEAT) They don't know where yet, but...we got a feeling--[now that] Nezhinski's out, he's gonna be there. 
BOBBY GREEN (growing emotional) You gotta find that spot... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MICHAEL SOLO You and your brother don't gotta worry about any of that. Just take the time you need-- 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY MIKE-- 
The men all turn around.    Joseph stands there, wounded but COMMITTED: 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) I'll be ready to come back and head it up. I'll be ready and, and we'll get `em. (BEAT) After the funeral. 
Joseph turns and reenters the room with the coffin. Bobby WATCHES him from behind, as his hand runs along the top of the casket. We HEAR: 
BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM... 
EXT. INTERBORO CEMETERY - DAY 
A LIMOUSINE pulls up against the backdrop of thousands of tombstones. Emerging are Bobby and Joseph. They are both wearing dark sunglasses. Rosario and Sandra and the children get out behind them and are led away by funeral coordinators to another place in the coming processional. In the distance, many many people and a long line of cars move toward the two brothers. 
The Undertaker walks away briefly, to direct some traffic. Bobby slowly puts his arm around Joseph's waist, prompting: 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY Bobby... I'm real glad you're with me now... 
BOBBY GREEN Course... 
Joseph grows more emotional, adjusts his sunglasses.    Leans to Bobby, clears his throat. Sotto: 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY You know, I was...I was jealous of you, [for a] long time. 
Bobby is surprised to hear this admission, and is taken aback by the honesty of it--especially in this moment. Joseph grabs his brother's arm, his voice cracking: (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) ...I always did what Pop wanted. And you were free... 
Bobby tears up, his voice breaking too; he shakes his head: 
BOBBY GREEN No.... I did it to hurt him...   I disappointed him... 
Interrupting the moment, the Undertaker approaches: 
UNDERTAKER Gentlemen? 
The Undertaker guides the two men toward the procession. Just as the drums reach a THUNDEROUS VOLUME, we GO TO: 
MINUTES LATER. 
A line of cars files into the cemetery, led by the HEARSE. The procession is PHENOMENALLY LONG. The New York skyline is in the distance. 
UNIFORMED POLICE LINE the narrow road. The COFFIN is removed from the HEARSE, put on WHEELS for the move to the gravesite. Bobby, Joseph approach. The DRUMS CONTINUE: 
BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM... 
People get out of their cars. Many of them we recognize from elsewhere in the film but don't know by name. One of the people to emerge from a Town Car is MARAT BUZHAYEV and his ever-present BABUSHKA WIFE, KALINA. 
The walk begins, with everyone saluting Bobby and Joseph. 
Behind them, the Mayor, the Commissioner, all the rank and file of the Force. The turnout is enormous. Rosario is here too, though several rows back. She is with the women. 
Bobby peers at the procession, which is made up of hundreds of SALUTING COPS, others. AMONG THEM, we SPOT: 
LOUIS FALSETTI. 
At that moment, BOBBY SEES his old friend, and the two make EYE CONTACT. Bobby is greatly moved by his appearance, and nods subtly to Jumbo. Louis salutes gently, a slight and sympathetic smile coming across his face... 
SIMULTANEOUS: Joseph takes a look at the COFFIN, grows more distraught. He breaks down. Bobby is there to catch him and does. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
Several WHITE-GLOVED COPS move to help, and then, trying to recompose himself, he squeezes his brother's forearm for support. Tries to straighten: 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY ...It's all right... I'll be all right... 
Bobby is devastated by seeing his brother like this and is momentarily rendered speechless. He tightens his own grasp around Joseph, leads him on the walk behind the COFFIN. 
FURTHER DOWN THE PROCESSIONAL 
Rosario. Walking. Eyeing the Cops, the Cop Wives. She does not fit in. Cops are staring at her. She SEES COP WIVES looking at her, leaning over to each other and TALKING ABOUT HER. Though she can't hear what they're saying, she is made to feel terribly uneasy... 
Rosario quickens her pace away from them, and the MARCH MOVES ON... 
EXT. GRAVESITE 
The line of police and relatives now heap dirt onto the coffin, which is in the ground. BOBBY and JOSEPH silently lead the line, shoveling dirt and moving on. Rosario moves behind them. Bobby SEES: BEYOND THE CEMETARY GROUNDS: TEENAGERS have climbed the trees. And they're LAUGHING at the spectacle. Michael stands next to Bobby. 
A beat, then Bobby speaks in a way that's preoccupied. Almost as if the words are more for himself than for Mike: 
CONTINUED: (2) BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) What fuckin' life did you have? You're a fuckin' cokehead--look at you! 
ROSARIO DIAZ (beat; deeply hurt) And you were clean, Bobby? We were TOGETHER-- 
BOBBY GREEN Well, maybe I was a piece of shit too! Wasting my goddamned time! 
She is momentarily speechless. 
ROSARIO DIAZ How could you say that...? We had PLANS-- 
BOBBY GREEN Wake up!   All that was nothing! 
ROSARIO DIAZ No! Now is nothing! Look at what's happened to your family, Bobby--your father, he's dead--look at your brother! It could all happen to you! 
BOBBY GREEN My brother's gonna be all right-- and nothing's gonna happen to me. 
ROSARIO DIAZ That's what you said before. 
A moment, then she turns to walk toward the bedroom. 
BOBBY GREEN Hey--where you goin'-- 
Bobby grabs her. 
ROSARIO DIAZ Get off me!   Let me go! 
He holds her by the wrists: 
BOBBY GREEN What the fuck you doin'? 
ROSARIO DIAZ Get off me! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
A TUSSLE. As he tries to restrain her, a torrent of emotion explodes from Rosario: 
ROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D) Get off me--I don't want it! It's not what I want! 
She breaks free. Panting, tears streaming down her cheeks. After a beat, Bobby seeks to calm her. 
BOBBY GREEN All right. Why don't you just calm down and think about it a little. 
She looks at him, frozen. 
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) You think about it, you'll feel different. You'll understand. And in time, we'll look back on all this and you'll see I was right. Look--I love you. (BEAT) Why don't you go get some rest? 
Without a word, she turns and walks back into the bedroom. Closes the door. Bobby sinks to the couch, picks up his drink. After a beat, we HEAR a: 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) We appreciate your patience, Bobby. 
THE FACE OF SPIRO GIAVANNIS 
As he looks into the CAMERA. We can't yet TELL where we are. He continues, backing up from us slowly, leading us somewhere not yet in focus: 
SPIRO GIAVANNIS The Commissioner is here now, and he's ready to go. 
We PAN AROUND to REVEAL: BOBBY GREEN, as he steps forward, in FORMAL POLICE UNIFORM. His HAIR is cut, closely-cropped now. He is clean shaven. A REAL PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION. 
INT. COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE - DAY 
A lavish room. Filled with photographs of important people shaking hands, receiving awards, etc. COMMISSIONER WILLIAM RUDDY, a middle-aged, balding, and yes, ruddy-faced man, is here. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COMMISSIONER RUDDY We're all very sorry about your father--he was a great man. 
BOBBY GREEN Thank you, sir. I'm gonna try and do my part too, now. 
COMMISSIONER RUDDY Good.   Raise your right hand. 
Ruddy leads him to the corner of the office. Bobby is guided into position as: the Commissioner picks up a small, leather-bound black book. With one hand, he holds the Bible upon which Bobby places his hand. With the other, he holds a manual, off which he reads an oath: 
COMMISSIONER RUDDY (CONT'D) "I hereby pledge and declare..." 
Bobby repeats after him. (This process continues until the entire PLEDGE IS COMPLETED.) 
BOBBY GREEN "I, Robert Green, hereby pledge and DECLARE-- 
SERIES OF SHOTS: 
Of Bobby in the POLICE ARMORY. He is RECEIVING his GUN and his BADGE. Over this, we STILL HEAR: 
BOBBY GREEN "--that I will support and defend the Constitution, both of the United States government and the State of New York, to the best of my ability..." 
INT. POLICE STATION HALLWAY 
He walks down the hall, with his back to us. 
BOBBY GREEN "...I will faithfully discharge my duties in the rank of rider in the New York City Police Department. So help me God." 
BACK TO THE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE 
Ruddy and Giavannis shake Bobby's hand vigorously: 
(CONTINUED) 
SIRENS. A GUN BATTLE. The LOOKOUT with the AK-47 is hit-- fatally. Bobby SEES several people FLEEING out a back entrance toward another section of the weeds. Joseph remains in the grass, his head down, his hands on his head. We cannot SEE his face... 
INT. ABANDONED BATHROOM STRUCTURE 
Vadim Nezhinski is frazzled by the approaching FORCE he sees through the window. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Moving with tremendous speed, he begins to light the FURS on FIRE... SMOKE... Vadim BEGINS TO COUGH, taking a suitcase of money with him. He backs out of the STRUCTURE. 
EXT. FLOYD BENNETT FIELD 
BILIOUS CLOUDS OF SMOKE.     BOBBY is MOVING TOWARD THE BUILDING. 
VADIM SCURRIES INTO THE WEEDS... THE SMALL STRUCTURE REALLY STARTS TO BURN. It is an odd flame, BLUE and SILENT. 
BOBBY RUNS OFF, into THE WEEDS, following VADIM. ELI CHARGES TOWARD HIS CAR. JACK is RIGHT BEHIND HIM: 
JACK SHAPIRO Stop!   Halt! 
Jack ruthlessly pumps Eli full of bullets, and the man falls down dead. Jack approaches, mercilessly FIRES ANOTHER SHOT into the corpse... 
INT. WEEDS 
The WIND HOWLS... Tall, tawny-colored weeds, marsh. BOBBY moves through the DENSE WEED GROWTH. Pushing his way through the brown plants. 
We HEAR POLICE DOGS. BOBBY starts THRASHING. The CAMERA is HAND-HELD, MOVING TO AND FRO WITH FEROCIOUS and VERTIGINOUS SPEED. ANGLE ON BOBBY as we: 
FLASH CUT TO: 
INT. CAR - IN THE RAIN 
It is Bobby, SEEING, through the WET GLASS: BURT, AS HE IS SHOT. DURING THE CHASE IN THE RAIN. We GO BACK TO: 
EXT. WEEDS 
Bobby raises his shotgun as he RACES THROUGH THE PHRAGMITES GRASS. The WEEDS PART. It is TRICKY. HEAVY BREATHING. BOBBY SEES other MEN running through the weeds, but he can't tell who's who. CONFUSION... 
BOBBY STOPS. FEET CRUSHING THE TWIGS... A GUNSHOT, FROM WHERE, GOD ONLY KNOWS... A RUSH OF IMAGES--SHADOWED FIGURES, OBSCURED BY THE WEEDS, APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR LIKE PHANTOMS... 
BOBBY'S HEARTBEAT THUMPS ON THE SOUNDTRACK... A MAN backing up toward him; each man has his back to the other... (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOBBY DOESN'T SEE HIM YET. BUT WE CAN. THE CAMERA ZOOMS INTO BOBBY, WITH THE FIGURE BEHIND HIM. BOBBY SEES THE SHADOW ON THE GROUND. He turns, SLOWLY...raises his weapon, about to FIRE when he realizes: 
It's MICHAEL SOLO, who, in profile to Bobby is unaware he's almost been killed. He stops when he feels the barrel of Bobby's shotgun against his ribs. SLOWLY TURNING AROUND, he sees BOBBY. WHISPERED: 
MICHAEL SOLO This's too dangerous. We'll all wind up killing each other-- 
BOBBY GREEN Vadim is in here with us. Radio our guys, tell `em to get into the clearing. 
ALL OF A SUDDEN, we HEAR, SHOUTED: 
MAN'S VOICE Bobby!   We got the old man! 
Bobby looks at Michael, points to his earpiece. Michael nods, and as we HEAR Mike's words into his radio ("Our guys, outta the brush!") Bobby starts to back up, toward the clearing... 
EXT. CLEARING 
Bobby is greeted by the boys. Other POLICE, including Michael Solo, emerge from the weeds, quietly. Jack APPROACHES: 
JACK SHAPIRO We got the old man--Buzhayev. Up by the cars. His grandkids are safe--they're in the van. 
Bobby acknowledges this, turns to another OFFICER: 
BOBBY GREEN Are all our guys out? 
The Officer looks, counts.     Then nods.   Bobby looks toward the weeds and says: 
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) Burn it. 
SEVERAL COPS BREAK FLARES, ROLLING THEM INTO THE WEEDS. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
All the officers back up--all of them except Bobby. Who stands, shotgun in hand, waiting for VADIM NEZHINSKI to emerge from the now-burning brush. 
TWO OTHER MEN come out of the fire, coughing. They are carrying their guns and thus killed by POLICE GUNFIRE. NO SIGHT OF NEZHINSKI AS BOBBY WAITS. AT LAST, HE DECIDES TO GO IN. 
MICHAEL SOLO Bobby?   What're you doin'-- 
BOBBY GREEN I'm not gonna let him get away... 
AS the other POLICE panic around him, Bobby ENTERS THE FIRE... 
INT. FIERY WEEDS 
Bobby walks through the FLAME. It is OTHERWORLDLY. The ORANGE-BLUE, the SMOKE, it all seems to blow from left to right... 
CHAOS of HEAT, SMOKE... We HEAR ONLY THE RUSHING WIND... BOBBY seems INCONCEIVABLY DRIVEN. Methodically stepping forward, past the FIRES, PEERING THROUGH SMOKE. NOTHING... JUST TUFTS OF SMOKE... 
Then he spots an area in which the SMOKE FLOWS UNNATURALLY, AGAINST THE BREEZE, as though it SURGES AROUND SOMETHING... SOMETHING COVERED IN SMOKE, STANDING... 
A GUST OF WIND PASSES--REVEALING--A SILHOUETTED FIGURE, WITH HIS ARM RAISED, POINTING, RIGHT AT BOBBY. 
VADIM NEZHINSKI, POISED TO SHOOT.

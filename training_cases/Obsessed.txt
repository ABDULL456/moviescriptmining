DEREK (with humor) Are you following me? 
LISA No. I'm taking these files to Mister Charles' office. They said it was this way. 
DEREK Derek Charles? 
LISA I guess you probably know him. 
DEREK Oh, yeah, I know him. (lowers his voice) Kind of an asshole, takes himself waaaay too seriously. But don't tell him I said that.     L ISA I could get you into trouble? 
DEREK Deep trouble.

DEREK (with a smile) Good point. 
Patrick CHUCKLES as Derek enters his office and vanishes inside. Patrick notices Lisa standing there with her arm load of files. 
PATRICK (to Lisa) Can I help you? 
Lisa stares at Derek's office. 
LISA That's Derek Charles? 
PATRICK Yes. 
Lisa breaks into a smile; obviously charmed.

DEREK Matter of fact, I just got off the line to Berlin. 
GAGE And? 
DEREK Ganz doesn't like the way the Stock Market's been gyrating and he thinks the hedge fund wave is about to crest. 
AGE You think he's right? 
BETH (cont'd) I've already met a dozen other women with kids the same age. One of them, Lauren something asked if we'd like to come over for a barbecue on Saturday.

DEREK Well, she probably didn't know when to come in. 
BETH I thought you said she was plain. Derek, that girl may be a lot of things but one of them is not plain. 
DEREK How would I know?    I only have eyes for you.      B ETH (LAUGHS) Oh, you are so slick. 
They put Kyle in his stroller.

DEREK (cont'd) (SHOUTS) Lisa! 
No response. He puts his ear to her naked chest, trying to detect a heartbeat. If there is one, he can't hear it. Derek gently slaps her cheeks. Rolls back her eye lids. Nothing.

DEREK There WAS NO affair. 
REYES So she just... made it up in her head? With no help from you? 
DEREK Maybe I was too nice to her, said something she took the wrong way, I don't know. All I know is I did not lead her on. 
REYES And you had no idea she'd be at the hotel? 
DEREK None. I don't even know how she got in my room. 
REYES Apparently she told one of the housekeepers she was your wife and lost her key. 
DEREK Doesn't that prove she did this on her own? 
REYES All it proves is she lost her key.

DEREK (cont'd) But I've told you the truth.    I have to know you believe me. 
BETH (weary sigh) I don't know what to believe. All I know is, I need to be alone for awhile. 
DEREK Beth, don't -- 
BETH I need to be alone -- 
Beth moves quickly upstairs. Leaving Derek there. He sits back on the couch, head in his hands. At a loss. After a beat-

LISA Come in. I'm sorry I'm such a mess but they won't let me take a shower or wash my hair. (dismissive laugh) Apparently I'm still on suicide watch. 
REYES I'm a police officer assigned to your case. How are you feeling? 
LISA Well, still a bit groggy from the medication. But it isn't stopping me from feeling ashamed for all the trouble I've caused. 
REYES Do you feel like talking about the other night? 
LISA Have you spoken to Derek? 
REYES Yes. 
LISA And he's all right? 
REYES Relatively speaking. 
ISA When can I see him? 
EYES See him? 
LISA Derek. 
REYES I'm afraid that's not possible.

DEREK Goddamit, Joe, if there's an injured party here, it's me. 
JOE Derek, calm down. I believe you and you know I'll back you up all the way. But if I find out there was something going on, I won't have a choice. 
DEREK That's not going to happen because there's nothing to find out. 
OE Good. Then you have nothing to worry about. Meantime I'm going to put Ben on the Ganz account. 
DEREK But Ganz is my client -- 
JOE Look, maybe you should take some time off. Just til this blows over. 
Marge sticks her head in. 
MARGE Sorry to interrupt. Derek, there's a Detective Reyes here to see you. 
Joe and Derek exchange looks.

INT. DEREK'S OFFICE - LATER 
Derek and Monica Reyes face each other across Derek's desk. 
DEREK She obviously ordered the flowers for herself. 
REYES With your credit card. 
DEREK My secretary keeps all my personal information on her computer. Lisa must have accessed it when she was working my desk. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Reyes gives him a blank look. 
DEREK (cont'd) You think I sent the flowers?   I'd have to be as crazy as she is. 
REYES There's more. 
DEREK More? 
Reyes opens a bag. 
REYES This is a print out of Lisa's blog. It's sort of a diary she was keeping. 
Reyes puts a large pile of papers on Derek's desk. 
REYES (cont'd) It's a rather graphic and detailed account of your various sexual liaisons together. D 
EREK What? 
REYES You can read them for yourself but I should warn you they're a little... X- rated. 
Derek pages through, growing more alarmed. We see thing like "THREE TIMES... FROM BEHIND... ON THE FLOOR... I WAS SCREAMING... WE WERE LIKE TWO ANIMALS... COMING TOGETHER OVER AND OVER... WHEN HE SLAPPED ME THE PAIN WAS EXQUISITE..." 
DEREK (REACTING) This is... none of this ever happened. I was never at her apartment. I never even touched her, let alone did any of this... 
REYES According to those entries, you're quite the accomplished lover, Mister Charles. And you made promises to her, promises to divorce your wife and marry her... 
DEREK You can't possibly believe this. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
REYES Whether I believe it or not is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is that she believes it. 
DEREK There's got to be something I can do to protect myself... my family. 
REYES You could file a restraining order.    But that may not be necessary. 
DEREK Why not? 
LISA Lisa's left town. She was released in the custody of an older sister yesterday. Her sister flew down from San Francisco and took her back. Lisa's agreed to check herself into a neuropsychiatric hospital up there. 
DEREK (some relief) Well, I can't say I'm unhappy to hear she's gone. Maybe now she can get the help she needs. 
REYES W ith any luck, Mister Charles, you'll never hear from her again. 
BETH (SLOWLY) I am telling you... you did.

INT. CHARLES LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT S amantha is sprawled on the couch. The TV is going, she's listening to music on her I-pod while texting a friend on her phone and paging through a teen magazine all at the same time, multi-tasking. 
She doesn't hear the door bell RING the first time. Or the second. Then there's a LOUD KNOCKING. Samantha becomes aware, looks around, then sees a shadowy figure through the frosted window next to the door. 
With a SIGH of annoyance, Samantha gets up and goes to the door. She unlocks and opens it. Lisa is standing on the threshold, looking fresh and pretty and smiling. 
LISA (super friendly) Hi, I'm Beth's friend Allie.      She's expecting me. 
Lisa breezes right in. 
SAMANTHA Mister and Mrs. Charles are out. 
LISA Out? 
SAMANTHA They went to dinner. 
LISA What? Beth told me to drop by. That's strange. Oh well, I have something for Kyle. I'll just run up and give it to him. 
SAMANTHA You can't.     He's sleeping. 
LISA Oh, I won't wake him.

SAMANTHA Maybe you should come back. 
LISA But I'm here right now. Why should I... oh, I see. Just doing your duty. Good girl. You know what, let me call Beth. 
Lisa takes out a cell phone, punches in a number.      Samantha looks relieved. 
LISA (cont'd) (into her cell) Beth? Hey, girlfriend. It's Allie. Where am I? Where are you! I'm at your place. You told me to come by. to Samantha) No it's okay. She forgot. (back into cell) No, Samantha was a little concerned so I said I'd call you. (winks at Samantha) Yeah. Okay, honey. You two have a great night. (to Samantha; holding out the CELL) Oh, wait. Did you want to talk to her? 
Samantha shakes her head "no." 
LISA (cont'd) (into cell) Beth, I'll call you tomorrow. 
Lisa clicks off. 
LISA (cont'd) (to Samantha) Great. This will only take me a minute. 
Lisa crosses to the stairs and goes up.      Samantha returns to the couch and resumes texting. 
INT. KYLE'S BEDROOM 
yle is asleep in his crib. The door cracks open, emitting light from the hall, turning Lisa into a silhouette. She enters the room, silent as a ghost, and approaches Kyle's crib. She stands over him, smiling down at the vulnerable sleeping child. 
Then, Lisa turns away and looks at herself in a mirror.

LISA Thanks, Samantha.   Nice meeting you. 
SAMANTHA (preoccupied; doesn't even LOOK) You, too. 
Lisa vanishes. Samantha sends a last message, then thinks she ought to check on the baby. She gets up, starts for the stairs when she gets another text message on her phone. She checks it, laughs and returns to the couch to text her friend back.                                                  C UT TO:

INT. ER WAITING AREA - A MINUTE LATER 
erek and Beth confer with Reyes.       Beth is very agitated. 
REYES Apparently Lisa stole her sister's ID to buy a ticket and board a plane to LA earlier today, then used her sister's credit card to rent a car. The sister didn't even know she was gone until a few hours ago. She said Lisa had been doing well in therapy. She didn't know she checked herself out this morning... 
BETH (EMPHATIC) She was in our house -- alone with our son. 
DEREK he doctor says he's fine. 
BETH Well, I'm not fine. to Reyes; demanding) I want you to find her. 
REYES We will. She violated the restraining order so we can arrest her. Look, Mrs. Charles, I know you're upset. I'm a mother, too... 
BETH How would you feel if it was your child? 
REYES Exactly the same as you. 
(CONTINUED) 
D

BETH Find her. 
Beth goes back into the examining room to join Kyle. 
DEREK Now what? Am I supposed to go out and buy a gun or something? 
REYES She didn't physically harm him. 
DEREK No, but she could have. Is that the message she's trying to send? R EYES Either that or...maybe she was trying to show you she could love him. off Derek's sickened reaction) People like Lisa... their emotions can turn on a dime. What you don't want is her feelings for you to change to rage. I don't know. But there's a good chance she'll try to get in touch. If she does, you need to call me right away. Meanwhile, you might want to beef up your home security. 
erek nods.

BETH Derek! 
Derek races out of the room. 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM 
The bedroom has been trashed. The bed has been stripped. The ceiling mirror is now a spider-webs of cracks.

BETH She never left.   She was here the whole time. 
Beth scrambles over and finds a wedding photo of herself and Derek. Again, her head has been removed. B ETH (cont'd) What kind of sick person... 
Derek crouches down and holds Beth who begins to cry, her body shaking. 
DEREK It's all right, it's all right... 
BETH No Derek! It's not all right!!! We have to do something. We can't live like this. 
As he holds his wife, Derek looks up and sees their reflection in the mirror -- twisted and distorted, like Lisa's mind.

DEREK Are you sure? 
BETH Yes. 
here's still that frostiness between them. 
DEREK All right. Say hi to your dad and tell your mom everything's going to be fine, I love her. And call me when you're leaving the house.

Beth clicks off and turns to Kyle. 
BETH (cont'd) Come on, sweetie. We're gonna take a little trip. 
KYLE (EXCITED) Legoland?

BETH Much more fun than Legoland.     We're going down to Nana and Poppa's.

LISA'S VOICE How are you? 
PATRICK I've missed you. 
LISA'S VOICE I've missed you, too. Everything okay around the office? 
PATRICK (hushed/secretive) Well, actually... 
LISA'S VOICE What? 
PATRICK I'm a little concerned. I heard the Charles' took out a restraining order against you. 
LISA'S VOICE (LAUGHS) Oh, that. That was Beth's doing. She's not handling this very well. Derek's just waiting for the right time to tell her he's leaving. P

INT. MASTER BEDROOM 
Lisa enters, carrying the ice bucket with the champagne bottle in it and the two flutes. She smiles excitedly, like a woman preparing for her lover's return. 
Lisa places the champagne on the night table. 
She removes her coat to reveal a sexy white nightgown, then reaches into the coat pocket and takes out a paper bag.

The ice bucket and champagne sit on the night table. 
Lisa stretches out on the bed, amid the rose petals, leaving a space for her lover beside her. She gazes up at the cracked ceiling mirror. She smiles at herself and, thanks to the cracked mirror, her smile is distorted, scary and insane- looking. 
EXT. CHARLES HOUSE 
Beth pulls into the drive. 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM 
On the bed, Lisa hears the car. 
She rolls off the bed and crosses to the window, parting the curtains to look out.

BETH'S VOICE (barely audible; to Kyle) Mommy will just be a minute. 
Lisa tenses, suddenly fearful. 
INT. DEREK'S OFFICE

Beth lets herself in. She's about to set the alarm when she hears the floor creak above her. 
Beth freezes.    She waits, listens. 
No further sound.    But Beth knows. 
Beth goes to the front door as if to leave. She opens the door and closes it as if she left the house. 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM 
Lisa, standing very still near the window, hears the sound of the door opening downstairs, then closing. 
Relieved, she moves to the window and peers out, expecting to see Beth getting into the car. But there's no sight of her.

Beth pulls off her shoes and lays them by the door. She begins to quietly tip toe up the stairs, certain to be as quiet as she can.

Beth enters to see Lisa peering out the window. 
BETH Girl, you're even dumber than my husband said you were. (BEAT) Or did you just forget to take your meds? 
Lisa whirls around. Beth is standing in the doorway, giving Lisa a deadly look, like a cat who's just trapped a mouse. 
Beth takes notice of the rose petals on the bed and floor. 
Lisa is wide-eyed, terrified, caught. Lisa begins to edge her way around the room. 
BETH (cont'd) You really fucked up this time... coming back to my house. Didn't you get my message? 
Lisa's eyes dart around for escape.   Beth seems remarkably calm. 
BETH (cont'd) You can look all you want but you're not getting out of here. ot until I've given you the beating of your life... bitch. 
And she means it, too. 
Lisa tries to dart around her. But Beth cuts her off, grabbing Lisa by the throat and forcing her back, slamming her hard against the bed post. L isa bounces off the post, stunned. Beth is on her, slapping her hard, grabbing a handful of Lisa's hair, ripping it out by the roots as Lisa tries to get free. Lisa lets out a subhuman shriek of pain. 
Beth tosses the hank of hair aside, keeps on coming.    She's beyond pissed. 
Lisa turns and desperately hobbles for the front door. But Beth easily beats her to it, knocking Lisa aside and throwing the chain. B eth turns and faces Lisa with a murderous look. Hugging the wall for support Lisa back away, leaving a bloody smear. Beth advances. 
In the kitchen, the phone RINGS.       Both women freeze.

Lisa tries to make it to the kitchen to get the phone. Beth grabs her by the sleeve and pulls her back. The sleeve tears loose in Beth's hand. 
DEREK'S VOICE Beth? 
Lisa stumbles back toward the stairs. She scrambles upward, thinking maybe she can get to the phone in the bedroom. 
Lisa reaches the top step just as Beth snags her ankle, stopping her. Lisa rolls around and viciously kicks Beth in the shoulder with her other leg. Beth falls back, tumbles halfway down the stairs. D EREK'S VOICE (cont'd) Beth, pick up! 
Lisa makes it to the bedroom.   She sees the phone on the night stand.

Reacting in surprise and panic. 
DEREK Lisa? 
Before she can answer, Beth is suddenly there. She rips the phone from Lisa's hand and strikes her with it. As Lisa stumbles back into the hall landing, Beth speaks calmly, even sweetly, into the receiver.

EREK (cont'd) I need to speak to Lt. Reyes.   It's an emergency! 
Beth goes out into the hall and Lisa springs on her. 
he two women fight, going up against the bannister. They claw and punch at each other. With renewed strength, Lisa forces Beth up against the bannister. Beth looks over the side and down... 
Fifteen feet below is that large glass dining table. 
Lisa bangs Beth against the bannister. A few feet away is a heavy crystal chandelier suspended from the ceiling by a metal chain. T he bannister rail begins to crack. Lisa tries to force Beth over, then Beth suddenly swings them around, reversing positions -- 
The bannister cracks, breaks apart and Lisa topples over the side. 
As she's about to fall, Lisa reaches out and grabs the chandelier with both hands. 
By a miracle, it supports her and she swings back and forth like a human pendulum but now the chandelier is beginning to pull loose from it's ceiling mount. Plaster cracks and rips away. 
Lisa swings back and forth, dangling. 
Beth stands on the landing. She looks at terrified Lisa, then up at the ceiling mount. It won't take Lisa's weight much longer. 
And both women know it. 
Lisa hangs by one hand, reaching out with her other hand to Beth who could pull her to safety. 
LISA Please....

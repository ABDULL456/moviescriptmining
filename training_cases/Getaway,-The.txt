DOC (pointing to the poster) It doesn't look like that. 
CAROL What do you mean? You've never been there. 
DOC I've been there every day for the last four years. 
She crosses to him and gives him a hug, then returns to her ironing. 
DOC (CONT'D) What's Beynon got set up? 
CAROL Small town, small bank, big money. 
She holds up some 11 by 14 photographs in front of him. 
DOC Where did you get those? 
CAROL I've been doing my homework. 
DOC Just like old times? 
CAROL Better than old times. 
DOC I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch. 
CAROL I made a mistake. I'll never make another one. 
DOC (after a moment) Where did you get them developed? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
CAROL Assumed name... Houston. 
DOC Good. 
RAFTER A MOMENT) 
How much is the score? 
CAROL Half a million. 
DOC That Beynon's got a long arm. 
CAROL (after a moment) What do you want for dinner? 
DOC Whisky and a peach. 
She laughs softly, and goes to a cupboard and takes out four bottles of whisky, four glasses and a bowl of ice. Doc smiles at her and begins sampling. 
CAROL (as Doc eats a peach with a sharp knife) How does it taste? 
DOC Just the way I remembered. 
Doc reaches across the table and touches her hand gently. 
DOC (CONT'D) You been okay? 
CAROL Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel. 
DOC How's Estelle? 
CAROL Fatter... some things never change. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DOC Boring. 
CAROL Nothing's been boring since you found me. 
DOC (carefully) That's not all of it. 
CAROL No. It's been a long time. 
A pause. He continues stroking her arm. 
DOC You go out much? 
CAROL After four years and now the question comes up. 
DOC Couldn't handle it then. Now I can. 
CAROL (with warmth and a smile) I'm still here, Doc. 
He stands, kisses her gently. She stands and they move toward the stairs. 
INT. BEDROOM 
THEY ENTER THE BEDROOM AND SIT SIDE BY SIDE ON THE DOUBLE bed. They both sit rigidly. Doc's eyes are on Carol, she stares vacantly expectant. 
Doc begins to unbutton her blouse, it comes undone with agonizing slowness... Carol pulls her shoulders back helping Doc drop the garment down to her waist. 
Carol begins to laugh softly. 
DOC Why are you laughing? 
CAROL I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you. 
DOC That doesn't hurt. 
CAROL But sometimes I cried a lot too. 
DOC (trying to smile) I didn't. I just waited. 
CAROL (deeply moved) Want to cry now? 
Doc smiling, still holding her hand, leads her from the table. 
THEY CAN'T KEEP THEIR HANDS OFF EACH OTHER AND LAUGHING with complete release they half carry each other into the bedroom. 
EXT. RIVER WALK CANAL - SAN ANTONIO - DAY 
BEYNON IS IN THE BOAT. LUNCH HAS BEEN SET. DOC COMES ABOARD. 
DOC You gotta be kidding. 
BEYNON Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch. 
Doc sits. 
Pedal boats cut through the water in the background. 
BEYNON (CONT'D) Glad to see you in civilian clothes. 
The Accountant and Swain are with Beynon in the boat. Apart from them two pedal boats come up behind Beynon's boat. Cully and Hayhoe are in one, and two other men are pedalling along in a boat numbered 13. 
DOC All it takes is a long arm. 
BEYNON Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions. 
DOC (sarcastic) I guess it was because I was a model prisoner. 
BEYNON This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him... 
Beynon nods toward the Accountant. He then turns and gestures toward the other two men. 
BEYNON (CONT'D) (continuing) You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals. 
DOC (flat, hard) I get my own help. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BEYNON (quiet strength) You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up. 
It's not a big bank but it handles cash deposits for an oil company... half a million... it's a family thing, the brother of the bank director is on the board of directors at Con-Sol Oil... Beacon City. 
Beynon nods to the two men and they immediately begin to approach in their paddle boat. 
RUDY BUTLER -- hard eyes and an easy smile; obviously a heavy gun... 
PRANK JACKSON -- young, mid-twenties, ruddy face and blond hair; a small man with blank, insensitive features. 
DOC (nods to Cully, Swain and Hayhoe) What about them? 
BEYNON They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean. 
As the two men arrive... 
BEYNON (CONT'D) (continuing) Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson... 
DOC (to Rudy) I heard about you. You work with Miller. 
RUDY You're out of touch. Cops blew him up. 
DOC Where? 
RUDY Chicago. 
DOC You were with him? 
RUDY Yeah. I got out. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
DOC (to Jackson) What about you? 
JACKSON I was backup man on a payroll job. (as Doc looks hard at him) I hit some liquor stores... I drive good. 
RUDY I drive. 
DOC Sure, (to Beynon) You're working on the passports... (as Beynon nods) ... and visas? 
RUDY What about the vault? 
DOC Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business... 
RUDY Wire pull over? 
DOC One-inch stuff on a three-number combination. 
RUDY I'm good at that. 
DOC I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way... 
RUDY (smile) Whatever you need. 
To Rudy and Jackson, Doc points to the map and farmhouse picture: 
DOC Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
CAROL (holding two passports and four visas held together by a rubber band) If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso. 
She hands Doc the visas, as she puts the two passports in her bag. 
DOC I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to GollieÂ«s. Okay. Any questions? 
RUDY Aren't we going a little hard? 
DOC What do you have in mind? 
RUDY It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one. 
DOC (a long look at Rudy) Dillinger got killed. 
Jackson and Rudy begin to exit. The Accountant enters. 
DOC (CONT'D) (to Accountant) Tell Beynon I want no mistakes. 
I make four phone calls, his boys better pick up. 
ACCOUNTANT I understand. 
DOC Beynon has to be alone at the drop ... one car at the ranch and that's it. I won't have the money... she won't know where it is until I'm sure it's clear. 
ACCOUNTANT He understands. 
DOC Make sure everybody does. 
INT. BEACON HOTEL - NIGHT 
DOC AND CAROL ARE GETTING READY FOR BED. It is the night before the robbery. Carol stands looking in the mirror. 
CAROL You know how I feel? 
DOC My mind's not on guessing games. 
Carol turns away from the mirror. 
CAROL Promise you won't laugh. 
DOC (shakes his head; smiles) If it's funny I'm going to laugh. 
CAROL I feel like the night before the first day of school. 
DOC That bad? 
Carol laughs. 
DOC (CONT'D) You promised not to laugh. 
They both laugh. Long beat. Carol gets into bed. Doc is already in bed. 
CAROL It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more. 
DOC Waiting's hard. You never learn how. 
CAROL You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting. 
DOC At least you were outside. 
CAROL It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DOC Bullshit. 
CAROL I mean it. 
DOC I know you do. But it is different. (before she can interrupt suddenly up a notch) It's different. (quieting down) We'll be all right tomorrow. 
A LATTICE-WORK BARRIER made of wrought-iron is pulled across the vault opening... the Bank President snaps the latch-lock closed. 
CAROL - IN THE PANEL TRUCK. She pulls the van carefully to a stop at the intersection as the stoplight blinks red... She turns her eyes back to Doc... 
DOC, CATCHES HER LOOK, then instantly springs into action. He reaches down, pulls a hatch-like cover up from the floor of the truck, revealing the road below... a portion of a manhole cover is visible. 
DOC (barking the words) Two feet forward... 
CAROL ROLLS THE TRUCK SLIGHTLY FORWARD 
ON THE STREET - SEVERAL CARS can be seen moving up behind the panel truck. 
DOC GRABS THE TONGS, inserts the ends into the manhole cover notches. He lifts the tongs and slides the manhole cover forward. Doc drops down through the truck hatchway and into open manhole, carrying the huge cutters with him. As he disappears from sight... 
98 RUDY DRIVING ON THE SIDE AVENUE, still moving parallel 98 to Main Street. The Buick is now geographically well forward of the panel truck. Jackson stares at his watch. 
JACKSON Now! 
Rudy makes a sharp left. The car accelerates, its wheels begin to quietly whine. 
Main Street comes back into view... 
CAROL WATCHING THE SIGNAL... still red... 
A MAN IN A PONTIAC eases to a stop behind the panel truck. He watches the signal. 
DOC STANDING IN THE SEWER PIPE. He turns on a flashlight, moves ahead. His feet slosh through the six-inch-high murky water. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Doc shines the light on several ankle-thick conduit lines that run along the sewer wall... He moves down the dark oval corridor... 
EXT. THE BANK 
THE GUARD OPENS THE FRONT DOOR, allowing the morning PATRONS to enter. 
INT. THE BANK 
THE PRESIDENT SMILES UPON SEEING THE CUSTOMERS. He looks over to the wood-frame clock on the far wall. 
THE CLOCK READS 9:00 EXACTLY 
RUDY - IN THE BUICK - MAKES ANOTHER LEFT TURN, now back onto Main Street. 
THE BANK APPEARS A HALF-BLOCK AWAY through the car window. Rudy and Jackson pull their watch caps down over their faces; the holes cut into the caps are wide enough to recognize a disparity between their features... 
MAIN STREET - THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL has now blinked to green. 
CAROL IS GRINDING AWAY AT THE DEAD ENGINE of the panel truck... 
THE MAN IN THE PONTIAC leans on his HORN... other cars behind him begin to HONK. 
CAROL LEANS OUT OF THE CAB OF THE PANEL TRUCK and gestures for the cars to pass her. She again GRINDS away at the engine. 
DOC'S WATCH - SHOWING 9:01. 
DOC STANDS AT A MASSIVE CONNECTING BOX where four 112 strands of the conduit intersect. He puts the wire cutters to the first conduit, grasps the insulated handles and with a crunching POP, he cuts through the conduit with one bite. Doc immediately starts on the next strand. 
CAROL - ON MAIN STREET - trying to start the engine. 
THE BUICK SLAMS TO A STOP IN FRONT OF THE BANK. Rudy Il4 and Jackson pull open the car doors. 
DOC CUTTING THE LAST AND LARGEST CONDUIT. 
INT. THE BANK 
THE BANK GUARD is placing a local high school basketball schedule and display into position. 
SEVERAL PATRONS have formed small lines and are transacting business with the Tellers. 
The wall clock shows the time at 9:02. 
RUDY AND JACKSON BURST THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR. They stand shoulder to shoulder, guns extended the full length of their arms. Beneath the mask Rudy's smile is visible. 
THE BANK GUARD LOOKS UP PROM THE BASKETBALL DISPLAY. His eyes widen... both guns are leveled directly at him... simultaneously the lights go out... 
THE BANK PRESIDENT DESPERATELY PUSHES THE ALARM BUTTON near his desk. (INSERT: Button and bell.) Nothing happens. 
CAROL - ON MAIN STREET - trying to start the engine. 
INT. A DENTIST'S OFFICE 
THE D.D.S. TORTURES A BALDING PATIENT with a drill. The PATIENT groans, lifts one leg in the air from the pain. 
When the power goes, the Dentist quizzically raises the drill and examines it. The Patient pants in relief. 
DENTIST Superior technology, my ass. 
AN ELECTRIC WEATHER/TIME INDICATOR - above the town square... as the bulbs dim... 
DOC RUNNING DOWN THE SEWER; stopping at the manhole he scrambles up the permanent ladderway, tossing his wire cutters up into the truck parked over him. 
THE BANK GUARD, glassy-eyed, but conscious; he has the look of a prizefighter who has just suffered a knockout, but is ready for one more round. 
THE BANK PRESIDENT in his prone position. He looks at Jackson, then to the vault. 
THE PANEL TRUCK - now at the other end of Main Street. 
CAROL EXITS THE VAN, carries the second sack to a large rubbish bin in front of an empty store. She deposits the grocery bag... 
DOC WORKING. The suitcase is now filled. He snaps the fasteners shut . 
DOC EXITS THE VAULT after withdrawing his .45 from his coat pocket . 
JACKSON SEES DOC LEAVE THE VAULT. He edges around the side of the tellers' cages toward the front of the bank. 
DOC MOVES TOWARDS JACKSON'S OLD VANTAGE POINT NEAR THE SIDE DOOR. He passes the bank president. 
RUDY NOW WATCHES DOC 
DOC CARRIES THE HEAVY SUITCASE IN HIS LEFT HAND. He gestures to Rudy and Jackson with his pistol while moving towards the side door. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JACKSON HALF RUNS PASSING RUDY ON HIS WAY TO THE FRONT ENTRANCE still watching the Bank Guard. 
THE BANK GUARD STILL PUNCH DRUNK PULLS HIMSELF UP TO HIS HANDS and knees... the Guard looks at his pistol. 
DOC STOPS AT THE KICKED IN SIDE DOOR. HE COVERS THE ENTIRE bank with his gun. 
THE BANK GUARD BEGINS TO CRAWL WITH AGONIZING SLOWNESS towards his pistol. 
RUDY EYES STILL ON DOC 
JACKSON NOW AT THE FRONT DOOR IS PARALYZED WATCHING THE GUARD. 
DOC GESTURES TO RUDY AND JACKSON TO GET MOVING. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
CAROL PARKS THE VAN, CROSSES TO A FORD, GETS IN, DRIVES AWAY. 
INT. BANK 
THE GUARD HAS MORE THAN HALF CLOSED THE DISTANCE TO THE .38. 
JACKSON LEVELS HIS .44. 
DOC AND RUDY. BOTH SEE WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. 
DOC (shouts) Just pick it up. 
RUDY Don't! 
JACKSON PULLS THE TRIGGER THREE TIMES. 
THE BANK GUARD'S BODY turns end-over-end from Jackson's bullets. Some of the bank Patrons SCREAM, others SOB with fright. 
DOC - His eyes are furious. 
RUDY AND JACKSON - Rudy shoves Jackson out the front door. 
DOC COVERS THEIR EXIT, then slips out the side door and into the alley. 
EXT. MAIN STREET 
RUDY GUNS THE BUICK FORWARD, the wheels tearing at the asphalt. Jackson's shoulders rock back as the big car accelerates. 
THE ALLEY DOC, GUN AND SUITCASE IN HAND, nears the end of the alleyway. 
CAROL - IN A FORD - suddenly pulls up, filling the roadway opening. 
DOC TOSSES THE SUITCASE into the back of the car... then slides the pistol under his coat and slips behind the wheel as Carol slides over to the passenger seat. 
INT. THE FORD 
DOC PULLS OFF THE WATCH CAP MASK; his face taut. 
THE FORD SMOKES OFF as Doc kicks it into gear... 
MAIN STREET BEACON CITY A SERIES OF ANGLES 
THE BUICK STREAKS DOWN THE CENTER OF THE ROADWAY... Two bombs detonate into fireballs... The Hay truck blazes upward, bales instantly igniting. 
The grange at the opposite end of town becomes an orange- flame inferno... 
Traffic stalls on the boulevard; Drivers and Pedestrians gawk at the twin blazes. 
RUDY ZIG ZAGS THE BUICK ALONG. Maneuvering through the stopped traffic. 
DOC SLIDES THE FORD THROUGH A RIGHT AND LEFT TURN, emerging onto smoke-covered Main Street. 
The speeding Ford avoids a halting car, then suddenly spins out of control, jumps across the sidewalk, splinters a wood bench, and finally slides in a complete circle across the grass of a small park. 
THEY GET IN THE CAR AND LEAVE. 
EXT. BOTTOM OP HILL - DAY 
CAROL IS DRIVING., tooling comfortably along a country road. Doc is beside her, the suitcase resting in the back seat. After several moments of silence: 
CAROL What about the bank? 
DOC (after a moment) Jackson panicked and nailed the guard. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Carol takes a deep breath,, then turns her look at the side window. 
CAROL Oh, Christ. 
Doc leans forward., snaps on the radio. 
EXT. ABANDONED FARM - DAY 
RUDY BUTLER STUMBLES BACK OVER THE CREST OP THE HILLOCK and onto the pathway in front of the barn. His figure is slightly grotesque; the raincoat shows two holes from Doc's .45 slugs, along with considerable dirt and grass stains picked up on his ass-over-tea kettle trip to the bottom of the hill. He is obviously in some pain, his walk is a half-lurch. 
EXT. SIDE OF THE BARN - DAY 
RUDY TURNS ON A RUSTED TAP which sends all-pocketed water gurgling down into a mold-covered trough. Rudy pulls off the yellow raincoat, revealing the fact he has worn one of the padded bullet-proof vests. Rudy undoes the vest, lets it fall to his feet. A huge crimson stain shows at his collarbone. 
RUDY TOUCHES THE BLOOD WITH HIS RIGHT HAND, then looks at his hand. Breathing heavily he kneels down and begins to splash the purling water across his face and then he laughs. 
INT. STATION WAGON - DAY 
DIALOGUE COMES ON THE RADIO DESCRIBING THE ROBBERY. $750,000 stolen. 
DOC We got between four and five. 
Carol starts to open the bag and count. 
Doc flicks off the radio then cracks open the windwing. Doc reflectively studies the roadside ahead. They are heading along a comfortable tree and meadowlined thoroughfare that carries only a sparse amount of traffic. 
Doc's eyes suddenly narrow on the road ahead. 
CAROL (now noticing the road) Doc... 
DOC (flat) I see it... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ON THE ROAD AHEAD HIGHWAY PATROLMEN HAVE FORMED a traffic barricade. Several cars and trucks are being waved through the check-point. Wearing sunglasses and Stetson hats, the Uniformed officers make a cursory glance into each passing vehicle. 
DOC ANALYZES THE SITUATION WITHOUT CHANGING EXPRESSION He slips the station wagon up behind a pickup truck in the line of slowly-passing vehicles. 
She turns, starts to reach into the back. Doc gently catches her arm, preventing her from moving further. 
DOC (CONT'D) They're looking for three men... remember? 
A YOUNG OFFICER looks into the cab of the pickup, then glances at the empty flatbed. Another PATROLMAN flanks the other side of the truck, repeating the procedure. Several Patrol Cars, fully loaded with additional OFFICERS, are parked nearby. The pickup truck is waved through. The station wagon rolls up to the check-point. 
DOC ROLLS DOWN HIS WINDOW. He smiles and nods to the Young Patrolman. 
DOC (CONT'D) (big smile) What's the problem? 
CAROL STUDIES THE OFFICER on her side of the car through the closed window... the Officer peers back at her then into the rear seat. 
THE STATION WAGON is waved ahead without a second glance by the Patrolman; Doc accelerates away from the roadblock... After a moment, Doc leans forward, snapping on the radio. 
EXT. THE FARM - RUDY - DAY 
Inside the barn, behind the wheel of the panel truck, Rudy's matted black hair is in contrast to his blanched face. He starts the engine, painfully bringing it to a ROAR. The panel truck leaps crazily forward, careening across the barn floor, SMASHING through the edge of the wooden doors as it bursts out into the sunlight. 
EXT. SMALL TOWN - DAY 
The station wagon rolls down the main street and stops near an outdoor phone booth at a filling station. 
INT. STATION WAGON 
DOC SHUTS OFF THE ENGINE, PULLS OPEN HIS DOOR. 
DOC MOVES INSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH CARRYING A FIST-FULL 
of loose change. He begins to dial... 
INT. BEYNON'S OFFICE - DAY 
THE PHONE RINGS. THE ACCOUNTANT LIFTS THE RECEIVER. 
ACCOUNTANT I 'm here. 
He presses a button on the intercom. 
ANOTHER PHONE IN THE OFFICE 234 
INT. HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 
DOC MOVES THROUGH THE SERVICE PORCH/PANTRY and into the kitchen. 
INT. KITCHEN - BEYNON - LATE AFTERNOON/NIGHT 
BEYNON SITS AT THE LONG KITCHEN TABLE] head on hand, eyes slightly glared... on the checkered oilcloth in front of him is a quart bottle of Jim Beam, now half full. He's drinking the sour mash straight with a water chaser. 
DOC LOOKS STEADILY AT BEYNON for a moment,, sets the suitcase down on the floor, then crosses to the sink, picks up a glass and sits down at the table. Doc pours himself a drink, takes a sip. 
BEYNON Hello, McCoy. 
DOC Beynon. 
BEYNON (swishing the drink) News said two persons killed. 
Except for a faint thickness of speech, Beynon seems quite sober. Beynon wears a .38 Detective Special C.T.G. in a worn leather belly holster. 
DOC Three... Rudy got ambitious. 
BEYNON And you got him... 
DOC That's right. 
Doc looks at Beynon, notes his gun, then continues stacking the money. 
BEYNON What about your wife? 
DOC What about her? (moving right to the business at hand) Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North. 
INT. STATION WAGON 
PARKED UNDER THE COTTONWOOD AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE. CAROL SITS CHEWING GUM... LINES OF STRAIN HAVE FORMED ACROSS HER FACE. 
INT. KITCHEN 
DOC LISTENS CAREFULLY TO BEYNON. 
BEYNON Your wife told me no one would be killed. 
DOC You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me. 
BEYNON They may nail me into this now, McCoy. 
DOC That's your problem. 
BEYNON (smiles) You know, you and I may be two of a kind. 
DOC No way. I always do my own work. 
Beynon smiles and slops three fingers of whiskey into Doc's glass. 
BEYNON Here. I understand the way you feel. As a matter of fact, you and I might share a great many feelings... 
Beynon drinks from his glass. Doc continues counting the money. 
DOC (snaps the words) I'm in a hurry. 
BEYNON You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are. 
DOC No applause! 
Beynon pauses a moment. Doc looks steadily across the table into BeynonTs eyes. Prom beyond there might be the quiet sound of a screen door opening. Beynon gets out of the chair, stands beside the table. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BEYNON Let's examine the situation. One, an extremely attractive woman. Then, there's the woman's husband, a skillful bank robber serving a long sentence in prison. Three, a man with political influence, a man who can easily get a parole for a convict... why should he? 
Beynon sips his glass slowly. Doc's hand edges down toward his waist band. 
BEYNON (CONT'D) (continuing) A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank. 
DOC I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8. 
BEYNON (cautiously) What do you add up to here? 
DOC One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million. 
BEYNON A little more was taken out before. (a beat) My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts. 
DOC So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you. 
BEYNON (smiles., nodding) The obvious. (as his smile fades) But we are both not interested in that right now. 
DOC No. (a long beat) My old lady must have made a lot of promises. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
BEYNON Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled. 
DOC PULLS THE WAGON to an abrupt halt within a parking stall - - at an isolated area. He steps out onto the concrete flooring, slams the door shut. 
Doc turns away from the car. As he approaches the elevator, Doc tears the orange auto park stub into fragments and drops them into a trash bin without missing a stride. 
INT. TRAIN STATION - MORNING 
CAROL IS STANDING IN A TICKET LINE THAT MOVES slowly foward. She struggles, clutching the heavy, money laden suitcase and her oversize purse between both arms. The line of ticket buyers moves forward .just fast enough to make it impractical to set the suitcase down. The station is ancient, vaultlike. Baggage lockers line the perimeter of the lobby and extend off into clumped rows within the wings of the station. 
CAROL APPROACHES THE TICKET WINDOW. She places the suitcase flush against the base of the counter and holds it tightly in place with one leg. Carol pops open her purse... a clumsy item in itself... as she lifts her wallet and the elderly ticket-seller looks across to her. 
CAROL Two day coach tickets -- on the Flyer. 
TICKET-SELLER Thirty-four fifty-six with tax leaves in forty-five minutes, gate three. 
Carol pays the tariff, places the tickets into her purse along with the change. Wearily, she labors the satchel back into her hand, then turns and begins to slowly walk down the seemingly acres-wide station promenade. 
NEAR A PORTICO WITHIN THE MAIN LOBBY, Carol sits uncomfortably on a shiny wooden bench -- the suitcase rests on the floor pressed tightly between her ankles. She glances across the promenade walls, her eyes finding: 
A CLOCK READING: 9:40 
ON A LOBBY BENCH - LATER 
CAROL STARES ACROSS THE ROOM at the scattering of passengers waiting on the wooden seats opposite from her. 
Carol's nervous boredom increases; she looks down at her lap, pretends to find something wrong with her nails and begins rubbing the cuticles. Carol finally rises impulsively from the bench, immediately reaching for the brown leather satchel. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CAROL WALKS BACK DOWN THE PROMENADE while carrying   the suitcase. As other baggage-laden passengers scurry   around her, she looks across the arcade, her eyes finding   a glass- walled Cocktail Lounge. She hesitates, then begins   to trudge in that direction. 
A BANK OF LOCKERS STANDS NEAR THE COCKTAIL LOUNGE. As Carol approaches, an elderly WOMAN deposits a coin in one of the numbered lockers, opens the metal door and places a small suitcase inside. Closing and re-locking the door, the Woman quickly moves away. Having noted the woman and more than tired of hauling her burden around the station, Carol steps to the end locker, takes a quarter out of her purse, then studies the time scarred operating instructions on the face of the locker. She slips the quarter into the slot and opens the locker door. As Carol bends to pick up the suitcase, the locker door swings closed... She tries to open it but the door has re-locked itself... Carol quite disgusted with her predicament, again sets the suitcase down and pulls a quarter out of her change purse. As she again reads the numbered directions, a YOUNG MAN appears at her shoulder. 
THE MAN IS A PROTOTYPE OF URBAN SLEAZINESS, Doberman Pinscher features are broken by a weedybrown moustache, a cheap corduroy suit is set off by an oddly matched bow tie. The Man's appearance suggests a kind of drug store dapperness. 
DAPPER MAN Kind of tricky, isn't it? 
She turns, startled by his sudden proximity. In one smooth movement the Dapper Man plucks the quarter from Carol's hand, deposits it in the slot and swings the locker door open. Setting the heavy suitcase inside, he closes the door, tests it to show that it 
has been re-locked, then removes the key from the lock and puts it into Carol's hand. She is intimidated momentarily by the Man's sudden appearance and forcefulness, as well as his intentions. 
CAROL Thank you. 
DAPPER MAN (toothy grin) No trouble lady. 
Stepping backward, his canine features disappear into a welter of station activity. Carol watches his receding figure for a moment, then simultaneously placing the key into her purse, she turns and begins moving towards the Cocktail Lounge. 
INT. BARN - DAY 
EMPTY CAGES STACKED ALONG A WOODEN WALL 
A YOUNG KITTEN IN A CARDBOARD BOX wrestling with the barrel of a .44. A thick veined hand gently rubs the gun over the fur along the cat's neck and backbone. 
RUDY BUTLER IS PREOCCUPIED WITH THE CAT, giving little attention to the thirtyish Man standing nearby. 
HAROLD CLINTON puts away a large syringe then snaps shut the medical bag. Rudy lies across a cot in one corner of the barn- like Animal Hospital. The large room is lined with stalls, cages and pens, many of them vacant. 
The wonded criminal is bare-chested. A plaster cast has been attached to his left arm and shoulder. 
FRAN CLINTON SITS ON A HIGH WOODEN STOOL opposite   Rudy. Five years younger than her husband, tight sweater and   skirt, bright scarlet fingernail polish, well-built, her   face suggests sensuality. Fran's bare, milk-white legs   are crossed under her rumpled skirt. 
RUDY (to Harold) What's the damage? 
HAROLD Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day. 
RUDY I got a nurse in mind. 
HAROLD (going along, oblivious to the implication) The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then... 
RUDY (flashing a grin despite the pain) The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso. 
HAROLD That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Rudy smiles at Mrs. Clinton. He's never met Fran before, but he's known her for years. 
RUDY Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton? 
FRAN (scared, but trying to be friendly) Just... tell us what you want. 
Rudy looks back down at the gun and cat. The following silence is like a scream. Finally: 
RUDY What kind of car do you have, Harold? 
FRAN (cutting in) A Ford... We have a Ford. 
RUDY That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back... 
He points the gun at Mrs. Clinton. 
THE THIEF ALLOWS HIMSELF A QUICK SMILE. Turning away from the window he picks up the suitcase, unbolts the lock and steps back out into the vestibule. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
AT THE BACK OF THE SMOKER, the Thief seats himself next to a window and places the suitcase on the cushioned chair opposite from him. In the forward position of the car, well behind the Thief's back, a dozen Passengers are scattered about the lounge chairs. A Conductor appears at the end of the smoker opposite the Thief and begins to collect and punch tickets. 
As the train begins to pick up speed, the Thief lifts an abandoned copy of the newpaper off the cushion next to him. He glances at the front page, then unfolds the width of the paper. As a precaution against regaining poverty, the Thief rests one foot against the suitcase. All seems secure. Then, Doc sits down next to the Thief. 
DOC COMPANIONABLY SLIDES AN ARM BEHIND THE BACK OP THE THIEF'S NECK, pulling him close. 
DOC (softly almost gently) When you pop a lock don't mark it. 
The Thief's knife instantly flashes into his hand, but before he can bring it into play, Doc catches his arms. 
THE KNIFE IS TIGHTLY WEDGED INTO THE THIEF'S HAND. Doc's fingers are vise-like at his wrist. 
THE OTHER PASSENGERS REMAIN PRE-OCCUPIED AT THE OTHER end of the car, taking no note of the quiet encounter. 
THE CONDUCTOR IS STILL AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE CAR from Doc and the Thief. He continues collecting and punching fares. 
INT. STATION GATE - DAY 
CAROL IS EXITING. THERE IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE 
LOUDSPEAKER -- the train has left. 
INT. TRAIN - DAY 
THE CONDUCTOR AS SEEN BY THE THIEF'S WIDENING EYES. He methodically punches the tickets, never looking more than two seats ahead. 
THE THIEF'S EYES BULGE AS DOC CHOPS HIM ON THE WINDPIPE. The Thief goes out. Is he dead? 
DOC CHOPS HIM AGAIN. IF HE ISN'T DEAD HE LOOKS IT. 
Doc pulls the Thief's hat down over his head. 
INT. STATION - DAY 
CAROL CROSSES INTO THE STATION, TAKES A DEEP BREATH. 
Sits... waiting. The soldier comes by, stops. She doesn't recognize anything. 
INT. TRAIN - DAY 
THE CONDUCTOR ARRIVES AT THE LOUNGE CHAIRS WHERE DOC AND THE thief are seated. He stops in the aisleway, expectantly leaning in Doc's direction. 
CONDUCTOR Tickets? 
As Doc takes out his wallet, peels a fifty out and gives it to him. 
DOC End of the line. Two. 
CONDUCTOR (grumpily) All right. 
The conductor cuts the fare receipt and begins to make change. 
THE THIEF SITS FACING THE WINDOW LOOKING VERY DEAD 
INT. CLINTON'S FORD - DAY 
RUDY SITS IN THE BACK SEAT AS HAROLD CAUTIOUSLY MOTORS 
DOWN the highway. With his one good arm, Rudy cares for the kitten resting in the cardboard box on the back seat. 
RUDY Talk a little, Harold, loosen up... good for you. 
Harold works his jaw, his grip tightens on the wheel. 
FRAN (chuckling at Harold) Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy? 
RUDY I Just want to find a suitcase. 
INT. KITCHEN - BEYNON'S RANCH - DAY 
BEYNON'S BODY REMAINS OUT OF SIGHT behind the overturned kitchen table... a small trickle of blood oozes out from under one of the table legs. 
The Accountant stands with Cully, Hayhoe and Swain staring down at Beynon's body. 
ACCOUNTANT They may still be going to Nogales. 
SWAIN What about Laughlin in El Paso? 
ACCOUNTANT Cover both, get someone down there... either Rudy and McCoy's got half a million. 
SWAIN They've got to switch cars. 
ACCOUNTANT Put out the word. 
HAYHOE (looking back at Beynon) What about Jack? 
ACCOUNTANT Tonight... take him out in the country, throw him down a dry well, if you can find one. 
DOC (looking at Carol and thinking about Beynon) No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on. 
CAROL Like what? 
But Doc doesn't answer. 
INT. TRANSIT HOTEL - NIGHT 
DOC LIES NEXT TO CAROL. Carol is eating a hamburger wrapped in wax paper. She passes one over to Doc along with some greasy french fries and a couple of napkins . 
The Suitcase has been placed on the small writing desk across the room. Doc silently munches his hamburger. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Doc glances at the poster rolled up. Carol hasn't put it up on the wall yet. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FIRST TRAIN - NIGHT 
THE TRAIN GOES CLICKETY CLICK THROUGH THE NIGHT, the young panther is stalking and prowling among the sleeping passengers. His Mother catches him, takes him back to his seat. 
INT. TRANSIT HOTEL - NIGHT 
CAROL IS BUSY UNBANDING THE MONEY PADS. A LARGE STACK OF discarded wrappers have been placed in a metal trash can near her leg. Behind her, Doc, now in his undershirt, reads a Texas newspaper. 
CAROL CONTINUES TO LOOSEN THE GREENBACKS. She is surrounded on the double bed by stacks of money. She lights a match, drops it into the wastebasket. The money bands quickly burst into flames, consume themselves, then die back into crinkly ashes. 
DOC (not looking up) There may be a hunting party. 
CAROL Why, there's nothing on the news? 
DOC I didn't mean police. 
He continues thinking. Carol watches him for a moment. 
CAROL Tell me about it. 
Doc looks across at her. 
DOC (calmly) Loredo is out. I've been thinking about Rudy. If he was on his own, we're okay. If Beynon bought him out... 
Doc looks at her. 
CAROL What? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DOC If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso. 
Rudy knew about Laughlins. 
CAROL You're full of ifs. 
DOC I think you liked it with him. 
I think he got to you. 
CAROL Maybe. At least I got to him. (pause) Where do we go from here? 
DOC El Paso. 
INT. FIRST TRAIN - NIGHT 
A WATER PISTOL APPEARS AROUND THE CORNER   OF AN EMPTY PASSENGER CHAIR. The seven year old brat   squeezes off several plumes of water. The Thief is hit by the   gun's spray, water runs slowly down his ear and the back of   his neck. 
KID Bang! 
THE BOY WATCHES THE IMMOBILE MAN. He fires again, once again there is no reaction. The brat steps forward... smiling, he pushes the thief's arm, pushes harder. 
THE THIEF'S BODY SUDDENLY FALLS BACK ACROSS THE CHAIR. His eyes roll upward... staring at the panther. His neck is bruised, he pushes his hat back slowly. 
THIEF (very hoarsely) Get me a doctor. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
CAROL SLEEPS ON HER STOMACH, her head resting across one arm. Doc lies beside her, eyes open. He looks over at Carol a moment, noting the long strands of hair that move rhythmically back and forth from her gentle breathing. After a moment Doc quietly stands, moves to the writing table and stares at the black suitcase. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
He opens the valise and lifts the large stack of greenbacks into a shaft of light coming through a crack in the drawn shade. Still holding the money, Doc looks back at Carol. 
ONE LAST TIGHTLY BOUND MONEY PAD - NIGHT 
Printed clearly on the brown wrapper. 
FIRST BANK OF BEACON CITY 
RUDY How you doing over there, Harold? You sleep okay last night? Good. I'm glad to hear it. Did you listen to the news? That means we don't have to drive so hard today, Harold... we're gonna be travelling a lot faster than they are... We got a lot more time than I figured. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Rudy continues smiling. He pulls the sheet away from Frank, then allows his hand to reach down, cupping her breast from inside the bra. Fran half awakens, pulls herself closer to Rudy. 
INT. ACCOUNTANT'S OFFICE - DAY 
HAYHOE, THE ACCOUNTANT and the rest of the boys are sitting in the office waiting. 
INT. CAR - DAY 
RUDY IS DRIVING NOW, Fran and Harold are not speaking. 
INT. CAR - DAY 
DOC AND CAROL. DOC IS DRIVING. They are also silent. 
INT. LAUGHLIN HOTEL - EL PASO - MORNING 
CANNON (one of the Accountant's boys, whom we have not seen before) ENTERS THE DARK NEARLY DESERTED LOBBY and approaches the reception desk. The large room is populated by overstuffed and threadbare furniture. 
LAUGHLIN looks very much like Dub Taylor and speaks Spanish just about as badly. He flashes a quick grin from behind the counter as Cannon draws near. At the switchboard behind Laughlin, CARMEN, maybe 35, sits next to the telephone jacks (all of them idle) readinc a movie magazine. 
CANNON You Laughlin? 
LAUGHLIN (Mr. Friendly) Yes, sir, and that's my wife and that's Junior. 
Laughlin indicates a seventeen year old BELLBOY sleeping in one of the overstuffed chairs. 
CANNON Congratulations. I need a room. 
LAUGHLIN No trouble. You came to the right place, one thing we got is a lot of rooms. What else can I do for you? 
INT. DOC AND CAROL'S CAR - DAY 
AS IT MOTORS DOWN THE TEXAS HIGHWAY. The black suitcase is propped up between Doc and Carol in the front seat. Doc, seated on the passenger side, bangs the car radio with his hand. The radio is obviously not working as he turns the dials and pushes the buttons. 
DOC (cajoling it) C'mon workl I (almost pleading) C'mon. 
We hear garbled words for a moment, pleasing Doc... and then the radio conks out again. This time Doc hits the radio hard. 
DOC (CONT'D) (angrily to the radio) Give me the news!! 
When it is clear that the radio won't work: 
DOC (CONT'D) You can't trust anything these days. 
CAROL I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody... 
DOC SLAMS THE BRAKE, GRABS THE WHEEL as the car veers over to the side of the road. 
DOC I trust... (he opens the black suitcase) Want to see what I trust... In God we trust... (he pulls out a bill and points at it) The word's on every bill!!! 
CAROL (slamming the suitcase closed) You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left. 
She starts the car up again, and continues driving, her knuckles tightening around the steering wheel. 
INT. CLINTON'S FORD - ANGLES - DAY 
AS IT LEISURELY MOVES ALONG THE ROADWAY BORDERED BY MILES OF SAGEBRUSH. Harold drives, Fran is again in the front seat beside her husband... a scrunched up sack of food beside her. She wipes her mouth with a napkin, shoves it inside the paper bag, then turns to watch the passing scenery. Rudy sits in the back, eating spareribs. He suddenly throws a just finished bone at Fran, hitting her on the shoulder. 
RUDY Have a bone, baby. 
He throws another sparerib at Fran. 
FRAN (shouts) Oh, Christ, you wrecked my blouse. 
God damn it, Rudy, what did you do that for? Jesus. 
RUDY (laughing) I'll tell you why I did it... it makes me feel good. 
He laughs and again throws another bone at Fran. She suddenly catches his mood and begins laughing herself ... tossing a bone back at Rudy. 
HAROLD CONTINUES DRIVING. His knuckles whiten around the steering wheel as a sparerib bounces off the window in front of him. 
THE KITTEN IS SLEEPING WITHIN the cardboard box, oblivious to Rudy and Fran's laughter. (That will be the day.) 
EXT. SMALL TEXAS TOWN - DAY 
THE CHEVY MOVES ALONG with the light mid-day traffic, passing various roadside business establishments, then pulls up before a radio/TV repair and sales shop. 
INT. RADIO/TV STORE - DAY 
ALL THE LATEST MODEL RADIOS are stacked on shelves around the small room... a television display featuring several models is in one corner of the shop. Another TV is playing near the counter and the PROPRIETOR'S desk. 
DOC A portable. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Carol moves ahead of Doc,, exits the Sporting Goods Store and starts up the sidewalk. 
DOC WATCHES HER FOR A MOMENT, THEN HEADS FOR THE DOOR HIMSELF 
EXT. SIDEWALK 
CAROL WALKS ALONE BACK TOWARDS THE CAR. 
INT. POLICE CAR 
HOMER AND JETHRO CONTINUE STARING AT THE CHEW. Their car is pointed towards the Radio Store, its back to the Sporting Goods house. 
DOC LEAVES THE SPORTING GOODS STORE, CROSSES THE STREET and begins walking up the opposite sidewalk, back towards the Chevy. 
CAROL PASSES THE POLICE CAR AND NEARS THE CHEVY 
INT. POLICE CAR 
THE TWO RURAL COPS MOVE INTO ACTION; their car pulls forward and parks diagonally across the street, partially blocking the roadway as xvell as nearly obstructing the Chevy. 
CAROL STANDS FROZEN AS HOMER AND JETHRO HOP OUT OF THE POLICE car, guns drawn. 
DOC CROSSES THE STREET BEHIND THE COP CAR 
HE LEVELS HIS big gun... 
Doc FIRES the shotgun through the "brown wrapping paper point blank into the squad car, caving in one side of the machine and blasting the radiator into a steaming wreck. 
Homer and Jethro hit the ground, paralyzed with fright as their car EXPLODES behind them. 
With three more BLASTS Doc blows most of the top off the police car then calmly reloads. 
DOC Slide those guns! 
The two cops send their guns clattering across the pavement. 
CAROL HAS INSTANTLY MOVED BACK INTO THE CHEVY, started the engine and begun maneuvering it out onto the street. She makes a U-turn, then pulls up near Doc. 
DOC STEPS FORWARD, KICKS THE TWO PISTOLS BACK UNDER the police car near the gas tank. 
He walks to the back of the car. 
Carol throws open the passenger door of the Chevy. 
Doc SHOOTS the gas tank of the squad car, it instantly ignites. 
Walking calmly around the burning police car Doc then starts to climb into the Chevy. 
Carol REVS the engine. 
Doc pauses a moment, looking back at the prone police officers and the blazing automobile. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Carol guns the car forward -- Doc, unprepared for the Chevy's sudden movement, falls flat on his face across the pavement. 
CAROL THROWS THE CHEVY INTO REVERSE, AND ROARS back to pick up Doc. 
DOC, A LITTLE CHAGRINED, PICKS HIMSELF UP, GRABS his gun and jumps into the Chevy. He slams the door closed, Carol again tears forward -- tires peeling down the pavement. 
HOMER AND JETHRO RAISE THEMSELVES. With very long faces they study the burning remains of their once proud squad car. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 
THE CHEVY SPEEDS OUT OF TOWN,, onto an open stretch of road. 
INT. CHEVY 
DOC JAMS ONE MORE SHELL INTO HIS PAPER-WRAPPED gun -- Carol grips the wheel tightly concentrating on the road... the Chevy continues to accelerate. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 
THE CHEVY CROSSES THE ROAD'S BROKEN WHITE LINE and passes a lumbering Greyhound bus. 
DOC, STARING AT THE HIGHWAY BEHIND THEM; the bus fades off into the horizon... 
DOC (finally) Here. 
THE CHEVY PULLS OFF THE HIGHWAY, MOVES UP A DIRT road for twenty yards then pulls into a cornfield of a well laid out farm, smashing through the six foot high stalks. Well out of sight, the Chevy slams to an abrupt halt. 
DOC AND CAROL, RUNNING THROUGH THE CORNFIELD AND BACK UP THE DIRT road toward the highway. Doc still carries his gun in the brown wrapping paper. Carol labors with the suitcase as she runs. 
ON THE HIGHWAY DOC STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, waving both arms overhead. The Greyhound bus comes to a lurching halt, Doc and Carol scramble aboard. 
INT. BUS 
DOC BUYS TWO FARES FROM THE SCOWLING GREYHOUND DRIVER. The bus again moves forward. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DOC WATCHES THE WAITRESS TURN AWAY 
THE CAR HOP STARES AT THE CEMENT PAVEMENT. Within the kitchen behind her the cooks all look toward the parking lot... their faces expectant. 
DOC WATCHING THE WAITRESS 
DOC She made us. 
Carol looks into the rear view mirror. Across the wide lot a police car appears, cutting in off the highway. 
Doc goes into the back seat, Carol kicks the engine over, jams the stick into gear. All this is accomplished while staring into the rear view mirror. 
DOC LIFTS THE LAUNDRY BAG-COVERED SHOTGUN onto his lap. 
THE POLICE CAR cruises slowly along the line of autos... 
INT. POLICE CAR 
TWO OFFICERS SCAN THE PARKING LOT. THE PASSENGER COP CRADLES a riot gun. 
PASSENGER COP Mercury. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
THE SQUAD CAR PULLS TO A STOP FIFTEEN FEET behind the Mercury, seemingly blocking the way. 
DOC Now. 
CAROL STANDS ON THE ACCELERATOR. THE MERCURY GOES screaming forward, as Doc shoots out the back window. Then, as the terrified cops duck to the side, he shoots out their front windshield. The Mercury bounces up across the sidewalk as the empty plates and glasses topple off the serving tray and roll across the concrete. The car slams back down through a vacant space on the opposite side, and moves around in a semicircle across the asphalt, heading for the highway exit. 
DOC SMASHES OUT THE REAR WINDOW with the butt of his shotgun. 
THE BLACK AND WHITE NOW IN REVERSE, ZOOMING BACK, trying to get between the Mercury and the highway. 
CAROL BRINGING THE CAR AROUND, SHE CAN SEE THE SQUAD CAR streaking backward. She pulls the wheel to the right and brings her car across the front of the still stopping Police Car. 
THE OFFICERS TRY TO BRING THEIR GUNS INTO PLAY AS THE Mercury streaks in front of them. 
DOC FIRES THE SHOTGUN TWICE 
THE POLICE CAR EXPLODES. THE HOOD IS LIFTED OFF THE CAR. Both Officers jump out of the vehicle, pouring shots after the retreating Mercury. 
CAROL - SCREAMING AS THE FRONT AND BACK WINDSHIELDS SHATTER around her. 
THE MERCURY, BADLY RIDDLED, PULLS OUT ONTO THE HIGHWAY 
ANOTHER SQUAD CAR COMES SPEEDING UP in the opposite direction. The Driver hits the brakes, the tires smoke along the street as the Black and White SCREAMS to a stop. 
CAROL PULLS THE MERCURY BY THE SQUAD CAR 
DOC FIRES ANOTHER TWO BURSTS... 
THE POLICE CAR - THE FRONT AND BACK FENDERS ARE HIT; the wheels disintegrate - the impact of the shells rocks the Black and White upward. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
THE SECOND PASSENGER COP, FIRING A .38 OUT HIS BACK WINDOW at the Mercury as it streaks down the road. Three holes open up on the trunk of the auto. 
DOC CAN SEE BOTH OFFICERS JUMP OUT OF THE SECOND Black and White through the rear window. Carol makes a quick turn off the highway. 
THE MERCURY ROARS DOWN THE DARK STREET INTO THE CITY'S COMMERCIAL SECTION, suddenly slow, makes another sharp turn - this time through a red light. 
DOWN A SMALLER STREET FILLED WITH SHOPS - CAROL ROUNDS THE CORNER, whips up to the curb - Doc and Carol jump out of the car. She carries the suitcase, he hangs onto his big gun. 
DOC AND CAROL, MOVING DOWN A DESERTED SIDEWALK; the SOUND of sirens. They round a corner, then quickly move into an alley. 
THE ALLEY IS NARROW, DESERTED. DOC AND CAROL pull back into an alcove as a prowl car goes SCREAMING down the street and off into the night. They continue down the alley. 
THE OPPOSITE ENTRANCE TO THE ALLEY IS BLOCKED BY a large metal garbage container, and the DRIVER empties two cans of garbage into it. Then he starts across the narrow street beyond in order to grab several others. 
DOC LOOKS BEHIND HIM, THEN GRABS CAROL'S ARM. They run for the container. Doc tosses the suitcase into the container, jumps in, reaches back, pulls Carol in beside him. SIRENS again sound close by. 
AFTER A MOMENT, A LARGE GARBAGE TRUCK PULLS UP, lifts the container with hooks and dumps the garbage and Doc and Carol into the truck. 
A SERIES OP ANGLES AS A CRUSHER BEGINS TO MOVE TOWARDS THEM INSIDE THE TRUCK. Doc and Carol start to panic, but they have room enough. 
WITHIN THE TRUCK DOC WIGGLES HIS .45 out of his jacket and into his hand. He, Carol and the suitcase are crushed tightly amongst the garbage. A moment after Doc frees his gun, a load of garbage descends on their shelter, partially obscuring them. 
THE TRUCK PULLS OUT 
DOC AND CAROL SWEATING... BREATHING HARD. Again the SOUND of sirens... the truck lurches forward. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
THE TRUCK MOVES ALONG THE EMPTY STREETS, passing several prowling squad cars. 
EXT. STREETS - SERIES OF ANGLES - SUNRISE 
DOC Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another. 
CAROL (setting the condition) No more about Beynon. 
DOC Whatever happens it's over. 
A pause. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
CAROL (not trusting his mouth) Sounds good. 
DOC You want to try with me? 
CAROL (smiling) Things can't get much worse can they? 
DOC I don't see how. 
A long moment. 
CAROL (finally talcing Doc's arm) Okay. 
DOC (slow smile) You and me. 
CAROL Can we make it? 
DOC We get to Mexico, we can have a life. 
CAROL That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted. 
As she pulls herself against him: 
DOC I'm going to try and get it for you. 
They pull each other closer, tightly holding one another. 
RUDY IS LYING IN BED READING A NEWSPAPER PILLED WITH DOC AND CAROL. The fact that they have been seen in the North. He smiles. 
Fran is in the bed beside him asleep naked under the sheets. 
RUDY (calling softly) Harold, you've had ten minutes, get out of there. 
No answer. Rudy gets up and crosses to the bathroom. 
INT. BATHROOM - DAY 
HAROLD IS HANGING FROM A BRACKET. Very dead and not very pretty. Rudy looks at him, then sits on the John continuing to read his paper.

RUDY AND FRAN ENTER THE HOTEL, EACH OF THEM CARRYING OVERNIGHT BAGS. 
Cannon watches them from across the room, carefully cleaning his teeth with a cinnamon toothpick. 
INT. FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR LAUGHLIN HOTEL - MORNING 
LAUGHLIN LEADS RUDY AND FRAN down the dark-walled hallway, stopping before room number 4l8. Laughlin turns the key in the lock, opens the door. 
LAUGHLIN It's hard to figure. There's something about the composition of the track at Pimlico... You can't go by the clock, any speed horse, take a second off any other track in the country. 
INT. ROOM 418 
AS THE GROUP ENTERS. 
LAUGHLIN (continuing) ... but a speed horse is the only thing that consistently holds form. They got to let 'em run, dumb God damn trainers try to rate 'em, just breaks their heart. 
Rudy kicks the door shut with a slam, grabs Laughlin's shoulder, spins him around, hits him full in the stomach. As Laughlin begins to fall Rudy catches him, wallops him again in the mid-section, then throws him back into a ratty armchair. Rudy instantly pulls out his .44 and shoves it hard against Laughlin's mouth. 
RUDY Okay, sweetpea, you get two choices. Live or die. 
RUDY (CONT'D) Do what I tell you, you not only get to live, but maybe you'll pick up some money. 
EXT. AIR TERMINAL - EL PASO ENTRANCE - DAY 
THE ACCOUNTANT., SWAIN, CULLY AND HAYHOE APPROACH A PARKED OLDSMOBILE... A HOOD IS DRIVING. 
INT. ROOM 
ON THE BED IN DOC AND CAROL'S ROOM, THE SUITCASE IS NOW CLOSED; the .45 automatic sits beside it... Doc's overcoat also lies across the bedpsread, near it the wrapped shotgun. The poster is again on the wall. 
CAROL still in the bathroom of room 318. She wears only a slip. Carol is washing out her bra and panties in the washbasin, using a coarse bar of soap. Doc enters; he begins taking off his shirt. 
DOC We've got some food coming, should be here any minute. 
CAROL Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours. 
DOC Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M. 
CAROL (mild complaint) Oh, Jesus... how? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DOC Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight. 
CAROL (smiles) I'll be ready. 
DOC (down) Yeah. 
CAROL What's wrong? 
DOC (shrugs) I don't know. 
CAROL Get in the shower. You'll feel okay. 
DOC (smile) Whatever you say. 
INT. FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY 
AS RUDY AND FRAN EMERGE FROM THEIR ROOM. The door shuts behind them, Rudy guides Fran to the stairs. 
INT. BATHROOM 318 
DOC STANDS IN THE SHOWER, THE HARD SPRAY BREAKING OVER THE BACK OF HIS SKULL. Tired, he closes his eyes, rests the side of his head against the tile. 
INT. BEDROOM 318 
CAROL STILL WEARING THE SLIP, she lies back across the bed. Her eyelids slowly fall shut. Carol has pushed the suitcase, overcoat and .45 off to one side. 
RUDY AND FRAN COME DOWN THE STAIRS. Rudy puts one hand inside his overcoat. 
INSIDE THE OLDSMOBILE - EL PASO CITY STREETS 
AS THE HOOD DRIVES, SWAIN IS BESIDE HIM IN THE FRONT, CULLY, THE ACCOUNTANT AND HAYHOE ride in the back seat. 
INT. ROOM 318 
CAROL IS NAPPING LIGHTLY ON THE BED AS DOC BURSTS out of the bathroom... again dressed in his shorts, holding his pants in one hand. 
DOC Get upI Carol's eyes snap open. 
DOC (CONT'D) (continuing) We're moving now! 
He quickly pulls his pants on... 
CAROL What is it? 
DOC Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses. 
CAROL So what? 
DOC If they are not here, he must have sent them away. 
INT. CORRIDOR THIRD FLOOR 
RUDY AND FRAN STEP INTO THE HALLWAY TOWARD ROOM 3l8a passing several rooms. Fran's face is taut. Rudy starts his nervous grin. 
INT. ROOM 
DOC SNAPS HIS ZIPPER CLOSED, REACHES FOR HIS SHIRT. 
CAROL You're crazy. 
DOC (hard) Get your clothes on, move your butt. 
She looks at him, doesn't move. 
CAROL Sorry. Look, I'm clean. I want to get some rest. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She is interrupted by a hard knock on the door. Doc drops his shirt to the floor. He quickly reaches down, lifts his .45. Doc gestures to Carol... she moves towards the door. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CULLY, SWAIN AND HAYHOE APPEAR FROM THE ALCOVE BEHIND the Accountant. They look over his shoulder toward the rear of the hotel, their eyes finding Doc and Carol. 
INT. WITHIN THE MAIN LOBBY 
DOC HAS ONE HAND IN HIS OUTSIDE COAT POCKET, WRAPPED 
around the .45. Carol continues to hold the suitcase up in front of herself, almost like a shield. The distance between Doc and Carol and the hotel entrance has been effectively cut off by the four opponents standing near the reception desk. Carol edges backward a few steps, toward the massive wooden staircase. 
ACCOUNTANT Just have her set it down. 
Doc's hand comes out of his coat pocket, a slow gesture revealing that his palm is empty. 
DOC You want it? Come and take it. 
THE ACCOUNTANT NOW PLANKED BY THE THREE MEN 
ACCOUNTANT (quietly) Get him. 
As the three men reach for their guns. 
DOC MOVES MUCH PASTER. HE DUCKS TO   THE RIGHT, levels the disguised shotgun and fires in the   same movement. The reception desk near the Accountant   splinters from the blast and he is hit painfully. The other   three men duck away from the sudden burst of fire power. 
DOC AND CAROL JUMP FOR THE STAIRS 
HAYHOE LEVELS HIS PISTOL AT THE RETREATING COUPLE Another shot from Doc's riot gun... this one breaking open the floor at Hayhoe's feet and cutting him down at the knees. Cannon, Cully, Swain and Max open fire as they dive for cover. They miss their shots, digging up walls, stairs and flooring. 
ON THE WINDING STAIRWAY DOC AND CAROL FLEE UPWARD She struggles with the heavy suitcase, Doc transfers the riot gun to his left hand, pulls out the more accurate .45 to use with his right. 
WITHIN THE LOBBY THE SIX MEN SPLIT FORCES 
Cully and the Accountant run to the elevator, enter it, pull the door shut. Swain and Hayhoe, limping, and Cannon and Max start for the stairwell in direct pursuit of Doc and Carol. All the men, save the Accountant, now have guns in their hands. 
SWAIN AND HAYHOE CAUTIOUSLY GOING UPWARD. Still below the first level landing, their eyes search overhead. The SOUND of Doc and Carol's pounding feet can be heard. 
HAYHOE LEANS OUT OVER THE BANISTER, points his gun directly up and fires. 
DOC AND CAROL BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOOR landings as Hayhoe's bullet tears by, ripping through the wooden banister supports. 
INSIDE THE ELEVATOR THE ACCOUNTANT AND CULLY WATCH the arrow indicator pass "Two." 
DOC AIMING HIS .45 RESTING IT ON THE BANISTER He fires two shots back down the stairwell. 
SWAIN AND HAYHOE MOVING UP THE STEPS TWO AT A TIME Suddenly Hayhoe's leg buckles as a .45 slug tears through his hip, the other bullet ripping the plaster wall near his shoulder. 
SWAIN IS NOW BESIDE THE BANISTER, he points his 54l revolver straight up... empties it. 
DOC AND CAROL AS SWAIN'S BULLETS BREAK AROUND THEM. Doc pulls Carol down, lifts the riot gun and fires down the stairwell with a huge roar. 
THE STAIRCASE TEN FEET IN FRONT OF SWAIN IS SMASHED by Doc's blast. Swain has to climb over the uprooted planking to continue moving upward. Cannon following. 
THE ELEVATOR INDICATOR STOPPING AT "THREE" 
CULLY PULLS OPEN THE DOOR, MOVES OUT INTO THE corridor. The Accountant remains within the elevator. 
SWAIN ON THE STAIRWAY FIRES HIS PISTOL UPWARD 
CAROL, ON THE STAIRWAY ABOVE, AS THE SHOTS SMASH PAST, runs ahead of Doc by three steps. They pass the second landing, keep moving upwards towards the third. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Doc's focus of attention is downward. He knows that he and Carol are being pursued up the stairwell, but he isn't aware of the fact that the gunsels have split their forces. 
RUDY ON THE THIRD FLOOR AGAIN RISES LIKE LAZARUS FROM THE DEAD. His head bloodied from Doc's heavy pistol, he slowly wobbles to his feet. Rudy looks down at Fran... she sobs violently, her back leaning against the wall. Rudy picks up his .44 then stumbles into the open door of Doc and Carol's room. He unsteadily crosses to the bathroom, closes the door. 
CAROL FRANTICALLY MOVING UPWARD, DOC HAS NOW FALLEN five steps behind. 
DOC FIRES THE .45 DOWN THE STAIRWELL AT 
SWAIN ON THE THIRD FLOOR 
Cully walks cautiously down the corridor, pistol raised. He moves toward the landing, having covered one quarter of the distance from the elevator. The Accountant is still within the elevator. 
Carol comes up the stairwell and looks back for Doc. The SOUND of Swain's pistol and Doc's answering .45. Carol senses a movement; she turns and sees Cully's gun leveled at her. As Carol screams: 
Doc dives onto the landing facing the corridor... his plane of movement knee high.,, the riot gun in his left hand, .45 in his right. 
CULLY IS HIT IN THE CHEST BY BUCKSHOT. The killing wounds fling him upward as he fires his own gun... his aim destroyed by the death blows,, the bullets stray above Carol, high of their mark. 
DOC FIRES THREE TIMES MORE AT THE ELEVATOR CABLE 
THE CORRIDOR WALL NEAR THE ELEVATOR IS SMASHED BY ONE OF the riot gun's jumbo shots, as is the top of the elevator. The plaster flies away revealing further damage. The cables are smashed, the elevator breaks loose and plummets downward. 
THE EMERGENCY CABLE, INSIDE THE SHAFT 
THE MECHANISM TRANSFERS OVER, line catching within the pulley housing. The line snaps taut - halting the speeding car. 
WITHIN THE LOBBY 
Doc half turns to Carol. 
DOC You okay? 
CAROL (nodding) Where do we go from here? 
DOC I don't know, airport I guess. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CAROL They will have our description before we can get a plane. 
DOC (way down) Yeah. 
SLIM I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you? 
DOC I kinda doubt it. 
Slim is obviously pleased that some excitement has come into his life. 
SLIM That's good... I'll cooperate, don't worry about that... yes sir, I've had some trouble with the law myself. 
Doc and Carol look at the man. 
SLIM (CONT'D) Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir. 
CAROL (beginning to laugh) Oh my God. 
SLIM That little job cost me a hundred dollars... didn't even get to keep the fish. 
DOC (resigned to the insanity of the moment) Let's just get to the border. 
SLIM Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is. 
EXT. CASETA BRIDGE CROSSING - DAY 
THE AMERICAN OFFICIALS SIMPLY WAVE THE CAR BY. 
At the white line a Mexican CUSTOMS OFFICER emerges from the station house. As he looks inside the car: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
OFFICIAL Buenas tardes... Your destination. 
SLIM (speaking right up) Chihuahua... gonna do some sightseeing. 
The Official smiles and motions them past. 
INT. CAR 
AS IT HEADS INTO CHIHUAHUA ON THE MEXICAN SIDE. 
SLIM Which way? 
DOC Juarez - Chihuahua City road. 
SLIM Don't you want to go to the airport? 
DOC Not now. 
CAROL How long before this car's hot? 
DOC (after a moment) Pull over. 
Slim stops the car near the soft shoulder of the dirt road. Doc looks at Slim. 
DOC (CONT'D) (continuing) Listen... how much money did you make this year? 
SLIM (slightly offended) What's it to you? 
DOC (patient) Come on. How much? 
SLIM 'Bout five thousand. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DOC How about if I buy your car for ten grand? 
SLIM You serious? 
DOC Sure am. 
SLIM And I keep my mouth shut? 
DOC That's what I want. 
SLIM I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?

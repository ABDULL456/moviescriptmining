OMINOUS, THREATENING MUSIC. The upper tail fin of a jet plane emerges through the cloud layer and PASSES THROUGH the FRAME like a shark's fin through water. It passes by again in the opposite direction. MUSIC BUILDS as the fin comes straight TOWARD the CAMERA, MUSIC SWELLS to CRESCENDO as entire jet plane lifts out of clouds and passes overhead.

P.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.) The red zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers. There is no stopping in the white zone. 
P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.) No. The white zone is for loading and unloading, and there is no stopping in the red zone. 
P.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.) The red zone has always been for loading and unloading, and there is never stopping in a white zone. 
P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.) Don't tell me which zone is for stopping and which zone is for loading. 
P.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.) Listen, Betty. Don't start up with your white zone shit again! 
Elaine enters terminal building. 
INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT 
Elaine is approached by a religious ZEALOT #1. 
ZEALOT #1 Hello, we'd like you to have this flower from the Religious Consciousness Church. 
ELAINE No, but thank you very much. 
Arrival-Departure TV monitors. Elaine approaches. 
ELAINE'S POV - TV MONITORS 
Reads: Flight 209 to Chicago - Depart Gate 89 - 7:25 p.m. Arrival monitor is goldfish swimming. 
BACK TO ELAINE 
She checks her watch and walks past Security Check area. CAMERA STAYS with a middle-aged couple, SHIRLEY and JACK, waiting to pass through Security Check. Behind them is sign reading: WARNING, HIJACKING IS A FEDERAL OFFENSE, etc. 
SHIRLEY Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago. 
JACK Yeah, I think he is. (waves) Hey, Fred! 
FRED recognizes Jack. 
FRED (yelling) Hi, Jack!!! 
A swarm of police and airport security men descend on Fred and take him away. 
EXT. AIRPORT - PASSENGER LOADING ZONE - NIGHT 
A limousine arrives. Two colorfully dressed BLACK DUDES emerge. An extra pesters them. Two HARE KRISHNA'S arrive on foot and walk toward terminal. 
P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.) There's just no stopping in the white zone. 
P.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.) Christ, you're as bad as your mother! 
P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.) Oh, really, Vernon! Why pretend? We both know perfectly well what it is you're talking about. You want me to have an abortion. 
P.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.) It's really the only sensible thing to do. If it's done properly, therapeutically, there's no danger involved. 
P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.) Have you considered that what's inside me is a human being; that it's alive. We made love. It's us -- you and me. 
P.A. SYSTER (male v.o.) That isn't true. A fetus at this stage is not a human being, nor is it a person. 
Krishnas enter terminal building. 
INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT 
The Krishnas are approached by the Religious Zealot. 
ELAINE It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect! 
She leaves. 
STRIKER (to CAMERA) What a pisser. 
INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - CONCESSION AREA - NIGHT 
CAPTAIN CLARENCE OVEUR is standing at the magazine racks. The first two sections of the display are books; the third is girly magazines. The captions over the disÂ­play are FICTION, NON-FICTION, WHACKING MATERIAL. He selects a magazine entitled "Modern Sperm" and begins to page through. 
P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.) Captain Clarence Oveur, white courtesy phone. Captain Clarence Oveur, white courtesy phone. 
Captain Oveur approaches telephones and picks up a red phone. 
OPERATOR (v.o.) No, the white phone.

OVEUR This is Captain Oveur. 
OPERATOR (v.o.) One moment for your call from the Mayo Clinic. 
P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.) Captain Oveur, white courtesy phone. Captain Clarence Oveur... 
OVEUR (yelling at ceiling) I've got it! 
P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.) All right. Thank you.

TURNANSKY (v.o.) This is Doctor Turnansky at the Mayo Clinic. 
INT. DR. TURNANSKY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
DR. TURNANSKY is seated at desk. Behind him are shelves filled with mayonnaise jars. 
TURNANSKY There's a passenger on your Chicago flight two-oh-niner, a little girl named Lisa Davis -- en route to Minneapolis. She's scheduled for a heart transplant and we'd like you to tell her mother that we found a donor an hour ago. 
On his desk is a beaker containing a beating heart. 
TURNANSKY We have the heart here ready for surgery and we must have the recipient on the operating table within six hours. 
The heart jumps out of the beaker, across the desk and falls off the edge. 
TURNANSKY I want you to make sure she is kept in a reclined position and that a continuous watch is kept on her I.V. 
INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - PHONE AREA - NIGHT 
TURNANSKY (v.o.) Also, it's important that...

EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT 
Ambulance arrives at airplane. Attendants and MRS. DAVIS unload LISA DAVIS into wheelchair. 
INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT 
Elaine and Striker are walking together. 
STRIKER Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over. 
ELAINE I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run. 
STRIKER Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change. 
ELAINE Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing? 
In the b.g. an airline PORTER is transporting an ELDERLY COUPLE in an electric cart. They round the corner too fast and the woman falls out. Husband doesn't notice. 
STRIKER You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record. 
ELAINE Your war record? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history. 
STRIKER You expect me to believe that? 
In the b.g. the Elderly Woman staggers to her feet and is immediately run over by another electric cart. 
ELAINE It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility. 
STRIKER But if you'll just give me... 
ELAINE It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry. 
She walks off. Dramatic MUSIC as Striker glares with determination. The religious Zealot tries to pin a flower on his lapel. 
CHECK-IN LADY Smoking or non-smoking?

INT. PASSENGER CABIN - ANOTHER AREA - NIGHT 
Elaine approaches Mrs. Davis and Lisa. 
ELAINE We'll be taking off real soon so we better fasten you in tight.

The temperature there is sixty-two degrees, with a twenty percent chance of precipitation. And now here's Victor with People in the news. 
BASTA (v.o.) Thank you, Clarence. Ali McGraw announced another spin on the marriage-go-round. And who's the lucky guy? You guessed it. None other than Olympic gymnast... 
Elaine approaches Mrs. Elderly. Striker's seat is vacant. 
ELAINE Would you like something to read? 
MRS. ELDERLY Do you have anything light? 
Elaine hands her a small piece of paper. 
ELAINE How about this leaflet: 'Famous Jewish Sports Legends?' 
MRS. ELDERLY (taking pamphlet) Yes. Thank you.

CAMERA WIDENS to reveal Mrs. Elderly's legs dangling next to him. She has hung herself. 
STRIKER It's just that when I start to talk about Elaine, I get so carried away -- I lose all track of time -- not unlike Oliver in 'Jesus: the Man.'

She takes a cup. 
BERNICE Ah, won't you sit down? 
MILTON Thank you. Cream? 
BERNICE No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men. 
MILTON Were you vacationing in Los Angeles? 
BERNICE Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.? 
MILTON No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation. 
INT. PASSENGER CABIN - NIGHT 
Elaine is taking orders from a couple and their eight year old son. 
ELAINE Would you like to order dinner now? 
MR. HAMMEN Yes. Steak for Joey and my wife and I will have the fish. 
JOEY When can I see the cockpit, Dad? 
MR. HAMMEN Well, I think that the pilots are too busy flying the plane for that, Joey. 
JOEY Aw, gee whiz. 
ELAINE I tell you what, Joey. I'll talk to the Captain and see what I can arrange. 
JOEY Gee! That'd be swell! 
Elaine moves on to the two Black Dudes.

Elaine is replacing a magazine and catches sight of Striker. 
ELAINE'S POV - STRIKER 
Boring another passenger. 
He turns to Basta. 
MURDOCK Ah, Victor, why don't you get the coordinates on the altitude vector and find out the ratio of direct velocity over engine speed? 
Victor is puzzled. 
JOEY You are Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets! 
MURDOCK I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence? 
OVEUR No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here. 
MURDOCK All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock. 
He points to his nametag. 
MURDOCK I'm an airline pilot. (to Oveur) Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies. 
JOEY I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense. 
MURDOCK (into microphone) Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner. 
JOEY ...and that lots of times you don't even run down court. 
MURDOCK We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner. 
JOEY ...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs. 
MURDOCK The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night. 
Murdock realizes he has given himself away. He quickly looks to see if Oveur is listening. Oveur is busy checking instruments. Murdock grabs Joey by the collar and whispers angrily. 
MURDOCK Listen, kid, I've been hearing that crap ever since I was at UCLA. Tell your old man to drag Unseld and Lanier up and down the court for forty-eight minutes. (into mike) Ah...Denver Control, this is Flight two- zero-niner continuing on a heading two- niner-niner...niner, ah...niner...niner.

Elaine is seated next to Striker. 
STRIKER Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember? 
ELAINE I remember everything. All I have are memories. 
Soft MUSIC begins. 
ELAINE Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us. 
STRIKER That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine. 
ELAINE But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past! 
Elaine leaves, teary-eyed.

INSERT - STRIKER'S PAINTING 
Randy takes the guitar and walks down the aisle. The guitar clonks people on the back of the head. Randy approaches Lisa. 
RANDY Is it all right if I talk to your daughter? 
MRS. DAVIS Oh, I think that would be nice. 
RANDY (to Lisa, who is reading) Hi! 
LISA Hi! 
RANDY I'm Randy. 
LISA I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar! 
RANDY I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song. 
LISA Oh, I'd love to. 
RANDY Okay, this is one of my favorites. 
Randy is sitting on the edge of the gurney as she strums three opening chords. 
RANDY (strumming and singing in ballad tempo) 'I've traveled the banks of the River Jordan, to find where it flows to the sea.' 
Stewardesses and passengers notice the singer and peer around corners and over seat backs. A man's head peers upside down from the TOP OF THE FRAME. 
RANDY 'I looked in the eyes of the cold and the hungry and saw that I was looking at me.' 
As singing continues, Shirley and Jack look at each other with saccherine smiles, the Hammens do the same, then the Krishnas, then the Black Dudes. Finally, everyone is smiling sweetly at each other.

Tempo Jumps to rock pace. 
RANDY 'There is only one river. There is only one sea.' 
Randy, in her growing enthusiasm, swings her guitar, knocking the I.V. connection tube from Lisa's arm. The I.V. squirts, and Lisa turns pale and hollowÂ­cheeked. No one else notices. 
RANDY 'And it flows through you, and it flows through me. There is only one people, we are one and the same.' 
Lisa manages to reconnect her I.V. 
RANDY (still singing) 'We are all one spirit, one name. We are the Father, we are the son.' 
Randy again knocks I.V. from Lisa's arm with guitar as the passengers start to get into the music. 
RANDY 'In the Dawn of Creation. We are one.' 
Mrs. Davis rushes to reconnect Lisa's I.V. Lisa doesn't react. Mrs. Davis pounds Lisa's chest. 
RANDY & PASSENGERS 'We are only one people, we are one and the same.' 
As Lisa revives, Randy swings her guitar and clonks Mrs. Davis on the head. 
RANDY & PASSENGERS 'We are all one spirit on Earth, one name.'

ELAINE Who wants to be first? 
MURDOCK Go ahead, Clarence, I got it. 
Oveur removes his headset, Elaine puts tray down. 
ELAINE How's the weather? 
MURDOCK Not so good. We've got some heavy stuff ahead of us. It might get rough again unless we can climb on top. But our airspeed is holding steady at six hundred ten knots. 
ELAINE That's great. By the way, Joey Hammen asked me if you would autograph this basketball.

The MAN next to her is wearing a surgical cap with mask. Hanging around his neck is a stethoscope. He's sleeping. 
ELAINE Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?

McCROSKEY Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit smoking. 
He lights up a cigarette. McCroskey walks toward a table and leans on his hands. 
McCROSKEY I want the best available man on this. A man who knows this plane inside and out and won't crack under pressure. 
HINSHAW How about Sal Mineo? 
McCROSKEY Get me Rex Kramer! 
EXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT 
Lightning and THUNDER. 
INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT 
Elaine is in the pilot's seat and the inflated automatic pilot is in co-pilot's seat. 
McCROSKEY (v.o.) Now, Elaine, right next to the throttle is the air speed gauge. What speed does it indicate? 
ELAINE Three hundred twenty miles per hour. 
INSERT - AIR SPEED GAUGE 
BACK TO SCENE 
We see, but Elaine does not notice, the automatic pilot very slowly beginning to deflate. 
McCROSKEY (v.o.) Good. Now check your altitude. That's the dial just below and to the right of the air speed indicator. 
ELAINE Thirty-five thousand feet. 
INSERT - ALTIMATER 
Altitude is dropping. 
BACK TO SCENE 
ELAINE No, wait. Now it says thirty-four thousand feet. It's dropping! It's dropping fast! Why is it doing that? 
By now the automatic pilot is really slumped over as it is quite deflated. It is staring at her with a half smile. Elaine notices it. 
INT. KRAMER'S HOUSE 
SOUND of car screeching to a stop. PAUL CAREY, twenty-four year-old, cleancut, naive-looking, navigator trainee enters and pushes doorbell. We HEAR the typical eight-note chime progression. The CHIMES then play the Air Force Fight song. A dog BARKS and MRS. KRAMER opens the door. 
CAREY Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer. 
MRS. KRAMER Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out. 
INT. KRAMER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
When Carey enters, a big dog jumps on him with its paws on his chest. 
MRS. KRAMER Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there. 
CAREY (holding off dog) Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer. 
MRS. KRAMER Something about a plane with no pilot? 
Carey begins to lose battle with the dog, while trying to remain polite. 
CAREY Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much. 
MRS. KRAMER Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there. 
Shep is growling and Carey's arm is locked firmly in his Jaws. 
CAREY Well...the airline business...does have... its moments... 
Shep pins Carey against the wall, ripping his sleeve. 
CAREY ...but after...awhile...you begin to... (gasp) ...get used to it. 
MRS. KRAMER Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here. 
We hear a THUD and loud growling. 
MRS. KRAMER Are you a pilot yourself? 
Carey is on the floor desperately fighting off the dog, which is on top of him. 
CAREY I'm...in a...argh...navigator training program. 
KRAMER enters, buttoning his coat. 
KRAMER It's unbelievable! How many times have I warned those people about food inspection? 
Kramer is tying his tie in the mirror. In the corner of the mirror, Carey is being thrashed by the dog. 
KRAMER The airport management, the F.A.A., and the airlines, they're all cheats and liars! All right, let's get out of here. 
EXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT 
THUNDER and lightning.

HARI KRISHNA #2 Rama Rama. 
INT. PASSENGER CABIN - ANOTHER AREA - NIGHT 
Striker is sitting next to a MAN FROM INDIA in a business suit and turban. 
STRIKER You see, the day we left the village it was raining, so we had to take a special jeep to the main road... 
The Indian is dousing himself with a can of gasoline. In b.g. Randy is talking to passengers. 
STRIKER In fact, we were lucky to even get a jeep since just the day before the only one we had broke down -- it had a bad axle... 
The Indian lights a match to immolate himself. Randy approaches. 
RANDY Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering... 
STRIKER The cockpit? What is it? 
RANDY It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes? 
The Indian holds the match, awaiting the outcome. 
STRIKER Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it. 
BERNICE I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me. 
MILTON You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean. 
BERNICE Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff. 
MILTON That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.' 
INT. PASSENGER CABIN - NIGHT 
Randy approaches Mrs. Schiff. 
RANDY Would you care for a soft drink?

MRS. SCHIFF Ooooh, such a nice soft drink. 
INT. O'HARE WEATHER CENTER - CLOSEUP ON TYPEWRITER 
CAMERA PULLS OUT to reveal Dispatcher typing message. 
RADIO (v.o.) National Weather Service reporting Omaha fogged in. Visibility zero. 
The Dispatcher attempts to remove the message, but it is stuck in the cartridge. He yanks on it, but the paper stretches out like rubber. The scene now becomes like a cartoon. He lodges his feet against the typewriter and pulls until the paper stretches to his face. He grumbles in Donald Duck voice. The typewriter snaps back and hits him. 
INT. CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT 
McCROSKEY (to Air Controller #2) Macias, get me Captain Oveur's wife on the phone. We'd better let her know what's going on. 
Air Controller #1 rushes in holding a piece of paper and hands it to McCroskey. 
AIR CONTROLLER #1 Steve, this weather bulletin just came off the wire. 
McCroskey frowns and hands it to Hinshaw. 
McCROSKEY Johnny, what can you make out of this? 
HINSHAW This? Why, I could make a hat or a broach... 
McCroskey grabs the note from him. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
MRS. OVEUR is in bed. Phone on night table RINGS. She reaches for it sleepily.

AIR CONTROLLER #2 (v.o.) This is Ed Macias calling from the airport. There's some trouble on your husband's flight. 
SHOT WIDENS to reveal she is sleeping with a horse. 
AIR CONTROLLER #2 (v.o.) We don't know how serious it is yet, but Harry Ballard thought you'd want to get down here right away. 
MRS. OVEUR I'll be right down. 
She hangs up the phone and rises. 
MRS. OVEUR I've got to go to the airport. You can let yourself out the back door. There's juice in the refrigerator. 
HORSE (sounding like Mr. Ed) Did you finish? Was I good? 
MRS. OVEUR Oh, you're all so concerned about performance! 
EXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT 
THUNDER and lightning; turbulent weather. 
INT. CABIN - NIGHT

KRAMER This is gonna be a real sweat. (into mike) Gunderson, let me know when you get anything. 
McCROSKEY I can't take much more of this! Johnny, how about some more coffee? 
HINSHAW Would you like half of my provolone and roast beef? 
McCROSKEY Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines. 
He pops a couple pills. Fifteen REPORTERS, Cameramen, etc. enter with Air Controller #l. 
AIR CONTROLLER #1 (to McCroskey) Steve, these reporters won't leave without a statement. 
REPORTER #1 How much longer can the sick passengers hold out? 
McCROSKEY Half hour...maybe forty-five minutes. 
REPORTER #2 Who's flying the plane? 
Air Controller #2 enters and hands McCroskey a note. Hands holding microphones are thrust INTO FRAME in front of McCroskey. One hand is holding an ice cream cone. 
McCROSKEY One of the passengers. But he's an experienced air force pilot who flew during the war so there's no cause for alarm. Hinshaw, take over. 
McCroskey exits. 
REPORTER #3 Have the families been notified? 
HINSHAW I think Florence Henderson knows about it! 
REPORTER #1 What are the chances of bringing this plane in safely? 
HINSHAW What are the chances of returning something to Montgomery Ward the week after Christmas?

KRAMER All right. Colosimo, you'll work the relay. Roberts, double check all air traffic within five miles. 
Roberts is scratching his ear. 
KRAMER And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson? 
GUNDERSON Yes, Captain? 
KRAMER Did you decide on a runway yet? 
GUNDERSON Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind. 
HINSHAW And the foliage looks so pretty this time of year. 
Gunderson exits.

MRS. OVEUR Steve! 
McCROSKEY Linda, your husband and the others are alive but unconscious. 
HINSHAW Just like Gerald Ford! 
McCROSKEY Now there's a chance we can save them if Striker can get this plane down on time. 
MRS. OVEUR That isn't much of a chance, is it? 
HINSHAW (appalled) Where did you get that dress? It's an eye- sore!

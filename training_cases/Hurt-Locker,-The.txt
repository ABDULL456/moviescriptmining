THOMPSON Need to keep my options open. 
Thompson twists to get his chest protector on. Eyes tight, brow furrowed, squints into the far distance. That's going to be a mean motherfucker. 
THOMPSON Okay. I'm going to make my approach. This area looks okay. No power-lines. Clean line of sight. If it looks alright when I get down there, I'm going to plug it in and we'll just blow it. Boom -- no more bomb -- give these people something to think about. (MORE) 
THOMPSON (CONT'D) I want them to know if they're going to leave a bomb on the side of the road for us, we're going to blow up their little road. Leave them a crater and an ear ache. 
Sanborn and Thompson put in their earplugs. 
SANBORN Ready? 
Thompson nods. 
THOMPSON I'm craving a hamburger, is that strange? 
Next, Sanborn takes a metal helmet with a thick glass front and seals Thompson's face in. Sanborn attaches the breathing hose. Taps his boss on the shoulder. 
SANBORN Not for you. (sealing him in) Happy trails. 
THOMPSON (HEADSET) This is Blaster One. 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Copy, that. Blaster One. You're good to go. 
Thompson turns to face the white bag and begins his walk toward it. 
EXT.   ROAD    DAY 
Thompson's stride is slowed by the eighty-pound suit...He CLUNKS down the road. Dust clouding from his boots... 
He moves past the same mounds of charred and rotting stuff, inner tubes, soda bottles, crumpled cans, steaming animal waste, and bits of fluttering plastic that the bot passed... 
The question is not - do you see a white garbage bag? It's which of these bags is the BOMB? 
Sweat slides down into his eyes. 
THOMPSON (HEADSET) 200 meters. It's boiling in here. 
UPRANGE 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Copy that. 200 meters. 
The RASP of Thompson's BREATHING loud on Sanborn's walkie- talkie... 
DOWNRANGE 
Thompson walks on. 
A knot of flies floats in the air in front of his helmet.    He lifts an arm and they disappear. 
The desert sun glints off a nearby car and momentarily bleaches his mask bright white. 
A YOUNG GIRL with an INFANT BABY in her arms appears in a far off doorway, then withdraws out of sight. 
He looks down, CAREFULLY watches his footfalls.   Garbage piled on top of garbage. 
UPRANGE 
Eldridge and Sanborn are at the ready, scanning the area and watching Thompson. 
THOMPSON (0.S) (OVER WALKIE) One hundred. 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Copy, that. 100 meters out. 
DOWNRANGE 
Thompson: careful footfalls on sand. 
Breathing. Heat.   Sun.   Sweat.   Flies. 
Suddenly a DOG out of nowhere charges, BARKING ferociously. 
Thompson is momentarily startled.    Then resumes his walking. The dog runs off. 
Thompson blinks more sweat out of his eyes. 
THOMPSON (HEADSET) Twenty five. 
UPRANGE WITH SANBORN 
Sanborn lifts the walkie.   Sweat in his eyes.   Wipes it away. 
SANBORN Copy twenty five. You're in the kill zone. 
THOMPSON (HEADSET) Thanks for reminding me. 
Eldridge nods.   Everything progressing nice and easy. 
DOWNRANGE WITH THOMPSON 
Thompson is standing over the blasting cap. 
THOMPSON (HEADSET) Alright. I'm here. I'm gonna put it in. 
SANBORN (OVER WALKIE) Copy that. 
Thompson picks the blasting cap off the ground and looks up -- 
As distant THUMP of approaching chopper wash quickly becomes super loud in his ears. 
--starts to run.   Fear in his eyes. 
BUTCHER 
--smiles back at Eldridge-- 
MACRO: thumb on send button of the cell phone. 
THOMPSON 
--running full out now-- 
BOOM --- 
- Fireball blasts out from the bomb 
-- flattening Thompson 
-- Blood splatters the inside of his helmet. 
-- thick cloud of particulate matter roils out in slow motion 
-- hitting Eldridge and Sanborn -- turning them black. 
With the roiling cloud we begin to float up and out over the entire city of Baghdad: 
--we see intersections jammed with traffic; American Humvees and tanks idle next to red-and-white taxis, beat-up Opals, the military and civilian mixed up in one snarling line, all competing for space, advantage... 
--we continue to rise until we take in the entire massive metropolis. Mosques and office towers ascend from a maze of dusty streets teeming with life despite two decades of war... 
The roiling black cloud thins in a light breeze and we hard CUT TO: 
BLACK 
CUT TO: 
INT CAMP VICTORY   TRAILER   DAY 
A shaft of afternoon sun creeps past a plywood-covered window, faintly lighting the interior of a narrow, low- ceilinged room. 
In the dimness we see contours: desk, chair, a large locker, and the silhouette of a MAN moving a cot away from the window. On the cot is a small duffle bag. 
We hear a knock from the outside. 
The man moving the cot stops. 
JAMES Yeah. 
SANBORN O.S. Sergeant James? 
JAMES It's open. 
The door opens and in the light we see Sanborn. 
SANBORN Sergeant James. (extending his hand) J.T. Sanborn. Welcome to Bravo Company and welcome to Camp Victory. 
JAMES Victory? I thought this was called Camp Liberty. 
SANBORN (SHRUGS) They changed it last week. Victory sounds better. 
JAMES It's Will. Good to meet you J.T. 
SERGEANT WILLIAM JAMES extends a hand. A former DELTA soldier is in his late twenties, good-looking, appealing face, solid build, one of the lucky ones. And yet, look closer. In the right light, there's an unusual depth to his expression, to his eyes and all-American face, as if he's guarding an inner chaos that could rush out at any time. 
Right now, however, James is doing his best to act like a regular nice guy. 
Sanborn looks around the empty room.   One duffle. 
SANBORN So, is that all you brought from Kabul? 
James motions to the locker. 
JAMES Yeah. Here, give me a hand with this. 
Sanborn helps James move the locker against the wall. 
JAMES By the window. 
They push the locker over the window, blocking the light. It's very dark in the room now. 
JAMES A mortar once hit near my trailer -- boom -- a two inch piece of frag cut through the aluminum and flew this far (gesturing with his hands) over my head, past my balls and landed in my computer hard-drive. Where's the damn light? 
Sanborn finds the switch in the corner. Then he comes back and taps the metal locker, testing its strength. 
SANBORN This should stop any lateral pieces. 
JAMES Yeah, I'm good unless it comes through the roof (smiles) in which case I'm gonna need a closed casket. 
Sanborn doesn't like the joke, tries to change gears. 
SANBORN The accent -- you from Georgia? 
JAMES Tennessee.     Trailer park off I-5. 
SANBORN Oh, right. I'm from Vermont. You know, "live free or die." Trees. Snow. Maple syrup. Pot. 
James gives him a polite smile. 
Sanborn soldiers on: 
ELDRIDGE Well I guess it makes sense. Anybody comes alongside the Humvee, we're dead. Anybody looks at you funny, you're dead. Pretty much, the bottom line, is if you're in Iraq you're dead. How's a tank going to stop that? 
SANBORN Gimme a break, Owen. 
ELDRIDGE (SMILING) Sorry. Just trying to scare the new guy. 
EXT   CAMP VICTORY/BAGHDAD OUTSKIRTS   MORNING 
The Humvee moves out of the base and into the outskirts of the city. Heat and sand and little else. 
INT   HUMVEE 
JAMES We had a few bombs up in Kabul too. 
ELDRIDGE Sure, I bet you did. But you're going to be real busy here, boss. 
James smiles, settles back in the seat. 
EXT   HUMVEE 
The Humvee is now approaching a cluster of cars. 
INT   HUMVEE 
SANBORN Hey Owen -- watch the fucking road. 
Eldridge moves up to the gunner's seat on top of the Humvee. 
EXT   HUMVEE 
Eldridge has a collection of rocks he keeps in the gunner's nest and now he throws one at the car in front of him. The passenger turns around. 
ELDRIDGE Imshee -- Imshee ! 
CUT TO: 
EXT BAGHDAD STREET   EARLY MORNING 
The Humvee grinds to a stop on the outskirts of town. It's a place teeming with trash, with dwellings that look as beaten down as the people. The ghetto of the ghetto. 
James is first out, Sanborn comes up behind him. 
Eldridge climbs out of the turret. 
They are now out in the open -- standing on Iraqi sand -- where anything can happen. 
SANBORN (TO ELDRIDGE) Clear here. 
Eldridge nods and begins turning suspicious bits of plastic over with the tip of his boots. 
ELDRIDGE Clear here. 
JAMES (looking around at the EMPTY STREET) Where are the guys who called this in? 
James walks on. Sanborn and Eldridge exchange a glance `what the hell,' and follow him. 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Victory Main, Victory Main, this is Blaster Mike. Interogative, Do you have an updated poz for the link- up? Has their position changed? 
After a moment a scratchy voice over his walkie. 
DISPATCH O.S. (OVER WALKIE) Blaster Mike, this is Victory Main. Negative. Figures to follow. Three- four-five-three is your grid. You should have a visual on them right now. They're waving an American FLAG 
Sanborn keys his GPSw unit. 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Negative, Main. No one in sight. 
DISPATCH O.S. (OVER WALKIE) Blaster Mike. You should have a visual, waving a flag. 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) (looking at empty space) Well, that's were I am and I don't see any guys in fatigues, and I sure as hell don't see any American flag, Over. 
James, Sanborn and Eldridge continue their slow walk down the street. An empty Humvee comes into view. 
ELDRIDGE They abandoned their vehicle? 
James walks forward. Unconcerned. Takes out a cigarette and lights it. Sanborn's walkie comes to life. 
DISPATCH O.S. (OVER WALKIE) Roger, Blaster. I copied you the first time. 
James approaches the empty Humvee. 
Stops. Turns to see a tiny American flag being waved in the window of a nearby building. James jogs over to the building, opens the door. 
JAMES Hello boys -- 
Looking into a room full of SOLDIERS who are trying not to look afraid. 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Yeah, thanks. Roger that. 
JAMES (TO SOLDIERS) Don't tell me the bomb is in there with you. 
A SERGEANT, slightly embarrassed, climbs out into the open and tries to act nonchalant. 
He points down the block, which is a sea of trash and white plastic bags. 
SERGEANT (pointing far down the ROAD) Down on that block, one of our informants says there is an IED in a white plastic bag. 
James has heard enough and even though the Sergeant may have more to say -- 
JAMES I'll get it. (turning to Sanborn) Break out the suit. (turning back to the SERGEANT) ) Keep your guys back. 
INT. CAMP VICTORY    MESS TENT   DAY 
Eldridge and Sanborn chowing down - two guys among a sea of SOLDIERS. Behind them in the mess tent hang the signs of various fast-food restaurants that cater to the troops: PIZZA HUT, SUBWAY, BURGER KING. 
SANBORN Ketchup? 
Eldridge passes his ketchup over to Sanborn. 
ELDRIDGE This is not Pizza Hut. (removing a slice of PEPPERONI) And this is not pepperoni. It's round and meaty, but it ain't pepperoni. 
SANBORN Goat meat, probably. 
ELDRIDGE Goat meat pepperoni? I'd be glad if this was goat meat pepperoni. (MORE) 
ELDRIDGE (CONT'D) I'd eat a truckload of goat meat pepperoni. No, this is something else. (slapping the fake pepperoni on the table) This is unholy. 
SANBORN Pray for something better -- and while you're at it, pray for a new team leader. 
ELDRIDGE You sure you want to be the guy in the bomb suit? 
They see James at a food station. 
SANBORN Be better than him. 
James approaches the table. 
ELDRIDGE Hey, James. 
James sits down to an awkward silence. Eldridge stops eating. Considers him. 
ELDRIDGE (TO JAMES) That was some crazy shit you pulled out there. 
JAMES Yeah? 
ELDRIDGE Hell yeah. You're either really lucky or really good. Right up on the car like that. Gun to the head. Crazy. You know it might backfire on you someday. You know that. You might actually die. And then what? 
James is puzzled. 
JAMES I don't know, what? 
ELDRIDGE You don't meet your maker. You just get vaporized into little bits of DNA. 
Sanborn watches Eldridge closely. Is he referring to Thompson? 
SANBORN (trying to be helpful) He asks everyone what they think about death. Ever since Thompson was KIA. 
James nods, turns to Eldridge: 
JAMES I don't think about it. Waste of time. 
James goes back to eating.     Eldridge keeps looking at him, then lets it go. 
EXT. CAMP VICTORY   MESS TENT   DAY 
Midday in Iraq. The heat is oppressive, biblical. 
James, Sanborn and Eldridge emerge into the blazing sun and the tumult of the base. Trucks barrel by. And troops -- everywhere, troops. 
James stops in front of young Iraqi KID selling pirated DVDs, while Sanborn and Eldridge continue on to the head shed. The kid, whose name is PELE, has DVDs fanned on a table. 
PELE One for five, two for nine. 
JAMES (HAVING FUN) Three for twelve? 
PELE Three for thirteen. And for you, no tax. 
JAMES (laughing, fishes out a five) Keep the change. 
EXT   HEAD SHED   PORCH 
Sanborn is smoking a cigarette and watching James buy DVDs, weighing him, when the team's FIRST SERGEANT, stocky with a paternal way about him, holds out a white envelope to Sanborn. 
FIRST SERGEANT The tags finally came. Figured you'd want to be the one to take them over.(handing Sanborn the ENVELOPE) 
SANBORN Thanks, I will handle it. 
The Sergeant nods. Sanborn stuffs the envelope in his back pocket. And the Sergeant heads inside, walking past -- 
INT   HEAD SHED   SIDE OFFICE 
A small office space with the door opened a crack. Behind the door, Eldridge is sitting on a swivel chair, looking at a computer screen, playing a computer game. Next to him in another swivel chair is LT. COL. JOHN CAMBRIDGE, a MILITARY PSYCHIATRIST, who is looking at Eldridge and the screen. 
ELDRIDGE (singing the jingle) "Be all that you can be," right? But what if all I can be is dead on the side of an Iraqi road? 
LT. COL CAMBRIDGE I'd like to see you move past this feeling that you're going to die, Owen. 
ELDRIDGE (looking at the screen) Why? I think it's logical. This is a war, right Doc? People die all the time. Why not me? 
LT. COL CAMBRIDGE That's true. But what concerns me is how much you think about it. You have to change the record in your head, think about other things. 
ELDRIDGE What do you think about? 
LT. COL CAMBRIDGE I don't dwell on death.(looking at his watch) I don't obsess. You understand what I'm getting at? 
Eldridge looks up at last. 
EXT CAMP VICTORY JAMES' TRAILER    NIGHT 
James stands before the open door of his trailer with the satellite phone in hand. Overhead a canopy of stars blinks. 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES ...So in sixteen months time I believe five million gallons per day is in fact rather conservative. 
SOUNDS out the window. An Executive turns his head nervously. 
EXECUTIVE But security is still the big variable? 
The Ambassador brushes his hand in dismissal. 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES Only on the margins. (SMILING) Everyday, the risks diminish and the rewards multiply-- 
Eldridge enters. 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES Ah, and here is EOD. You see gentlemen, everything is fine. The site is secure. The bomb -- if there even is one -- will easily be dispensed by the crack American team. 
ELDRIDGE Excuse me. 
Eldridge rushes over to the window to see the street. 
ELDRIDGE (INTO WALKIE) Blaster Mike, I'm at the window. 
SANBORN 
He's stationed himself near the mouth of the alley.   Wisps of smoke and flames in the air. 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Copy that. How's the fire look from up there. 
AMBASSADOR'S OFFICE 
ELDRIDGE (INTO WALKIE) Flames a meter high, over. 
JAMES 
Close to the burning car. SMOKE rising from the hood and the under carriage awash in FLAMES, like a sleeping dragon. 
James sprays the fire-extinguisher and the fire subsides. He inspects the interior - looks normal enough - and tries to open the trunk with a pair of pliers, but the handle doesn't give and snaps off under his effort. He kicks the trunk but it remains shut. He turns and lumbers up range, jaw set. 
SANBORN 
Watching James walk back uprange. 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Blaster One, what is going on? 
JAMES O.S. (HEADSET) Stay put, I'll be right back. 
Standing alone in the kill zone at the mouth of the alley. 
ELDRIDGE (OVER WALKIE) What's happening? 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Good question. But I'm not liking it. 
HUMVEE 
James is buried inside the Humvee, searching. He tosses what he doesn't need, and a succession of items comes flying out -- food, clothing, a tarp. Now James walks back towards the Blue Opal without saying a word. In his hand is a crowbar. 
BLUE OPAL 
James winds up and swings hard at the door. Wham! Nope. Wham! Wham! Wham! 
He drops the crowbar and tries the trunk. Presto, it opens, revealing: a trunk overflowing with EXPLOSIVES -- ten times what we've seen before. James is taken aback. 
JAMES (HEADSET) We're all in the kill zone on this one. 
SANBORN 
Sanborn stares at James and the car. Great. 
JAMES 
Now inside the car, slipping on the slimy seats, he cuts the seat cushions with his knife, and rips out the foam upholstery, and finds more bad news buried underneath: SIX ARTILLERY SHELLS and a WIRE that leads to the floorboard and goes under the carpeting. 
James DIVES to the wire and cuts it, then rips open the carpet to reveal more wire -- and follows the wire through the car, ripping apart the car PIECE by PIECE, cutting wire as he goes. 
AMBASSADOR'S OFFICE 
An executive gets up to look out the window. 
ELDRIDGE (TO EXECUTIVE) Sir, I'm going to need you to stay away from the window. 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES Yes, please, sit down. It's safe. 
EXECUTIVE Why is he here, if it's safe? 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES He is just an observer. 
EXECUTIVE (TO ELDRIDGE) Is that true, we're safe here? 
ELDRIDGE (DISTRACTED) In my opinion, no. 
Executives take this as a cue to leave. Getting up, shuffling out of the room. The Ambassador is furious at Eldridge, advancing on him. 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES This is idiotic. Why not tow the vehicle away from the building? 
ELDRIDGE I believe the lane is too narrow for a Humvee, Sir. 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES Donkeys.   Use donkeys. 
ELDRIDGE I don't believe we have any of those on hand, Sir. 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES Jesus, Lord. You Americans really are incompetent. No donkeys on hand? What do you think I'm talking about, a full squadron of farm animals? 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Negative, Negative. Hold your fire. (shouting at bicyclist) Get the fuck out of here! 
The bicyclist does an about face, but not before casting a last suspicious glance back at the car bomb. 
Sanborn refocuses on the Opal; he's losing his cool. 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Blaster One, do you copy, over? 
JAMES 
Still sitting in the back seat. Now he sees the smoking vent. 
JAMES (HEADSET) Gimmie a minute. 
ELDRIDGE 
Eyes never leaving the street below, flicks the safety of his rifle back on. 
Geddes notices the sweat on Eldridge's face, and feels a sudden surge of sympathy for the younger man. 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES Well done.     That took great self control. 
ELDRIDGE Thank you, sir. Again, I apologize for the intrusion into -- 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES Yes, but I doubt the insurgents will appreciate your restraint. (in a kindly, paternal tone) If I may give you a piece of free advice, next time, pull the trigger. 
ELDRIDGE Well, actually, the uh--rules -- 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES That's the only way out, I'm afraid. When you're in a losing battle, you have to draw blood. No insurgency in modern history has ever been truly defeated, so all you can do is manage your exit. Clear a wide swath of bodies so you have room to withdraw. 
Suddenly the office door opens and a YOUNG AIDE appears. 
AIDE The building is empty, Sir, except for you. 
Geddes nods, grabs his coat and moves to Eldridge for one last jab. 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES I'm sorry to say it, but that's just how it's done. You need to show some vigor. In Kenya, we executed the insurgents in their beds, until they gave us room. Falklands, the same. That's just how it's done. 
Eldridge looks up, he's had enough.   Swings around. 
ELDRIDGE Is that how you did it in Northern Ireland? With murder? 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES (SMILING) There you are. Now you're showing some vigor. 
And leaves. 
ELDRIDGE (INTO WALKIE) J.T, the building is clear now. We can pull out. 
SANBORN 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Roger that. (to James) Will, we can pull out. The building is evacuated. (NO ANSWER) James? 
Still no answer. 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Blaster One, we are cleared to leave this fucking site. Walk away. Do you copy, over? 
JAMES 
JAMES (HEADSET) Stay where you are, Sanborn. I'm not done. 
And with that, James turns off his walkie.      CLICK. 
ELDRIDGE 
ELDRIDGE (INTO WALKIE) J.T., are we moving? 
SANBORN 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Negative. Negative. 
ELDRIDGE O.S. (OVER TALKIE) I didn't copy that. Did you say negative? 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Roger. We are staying until James is finished. (NERVOUSLY) James, what's the situation? (NO ANSWER) Goddamn, Will, I need a report. 
JAMES 
James' POV. He sees in the corner of the back seat, having just wiped away a puddle of fire retardant, a little black box, with a wire leading out of it. He grabs the box. 
JAMES Got it. 
BLUE OPAL 
The black box goes flying out of the car. 
EXT   MOUTH OF CUL DE SAC 
Sanborn is furious, stalking ahead of James as they return uprange. 
Sanborn passes Eldridge, who has come down from the ambassador's office. 
SANBORN Take the suit. 
HUMVEE 
James' face looks flushed, red, sweat dripping. Eldridge begins ripping apart the Velcro from James' legs. 
MOMENTS LATER 
James sits in the car, smoking. 
SANBORN Fuck, Owen. I don't know. Probably not. 
CUT TO: 
EXT CAMP VICTORY   WEAPONS DISCHARGE STATION   AFTERNOON 
James, Sanborn and Eldridge are discharging their weapons, dry firing them into steel drums. Clicking of ammunition. Long shadows. 
EXT CAMP VICTORY   FIRST SERGEANT'S TRAILER    AFTERNOON 
James steps out, grabs a smoke, as a soccer ball rolls beside him. It's Pele's. Inviting James to play. 
PELE (SHOUTING) Ball! Ball! 
James picks it up, and carries it over to a pile of sandbags and sits down. Pele runs up. 
PELE Give it. 
JAMES Give me my five bucks and I'll give you your ball. 
PELE Five dollars - for what? 
JAMES Those DVDs were crap. They were so fuzzy I couldn't see a thing. 
PELE No, impossible. 
JAMES I'm telling you, they were fuzzy. 
PELE That's Hollywood, my man. Special effects. 
The boy's chutzpa amuses James. He's starting to like this kid. 
JAMES What's your name anyway? 
PELE Pele. 
JAMES Oh yeah - like the soccer player? 
PELE Yes, the great Pele 
James gets up. Motions for the kid to give him space. 
JAMES Ready? One, two -- 
He smashes the ball in Pele's direction -- it flies up. Pele blocks it easily, kicking high in the air. 
JAMES -- three. Shit. 
Pele comes back over to James, who has sat back down.   He notices the bomb patch on James' uniform. 
PELE (pointing to the patch) So you are EOD -- boomala boomala. It's fun, no? 
JAMES I like to disarm them. Tell   you what, kid, I'll buy another   DVD from you but if this one is   fuzzy you better watch out. Cause   I'm coming for you. 
INT   CAMP VICTORY MESS TENT    DAY 
Sanborn and Eldridge eat together. In the corner of the room, James is eating alone in a sea of soldiers. 
INT CAMP VICTORY   HEAD SHED 
Eldridge and the psychiatrist are back in session. 
ELDRIDGE (LEANING FORWARD) What if I should be pulling the trigger more often? Killing people? Bomb makers. 
LT. COL. CAMBBRIDGE That's not your mission. Your mission is to protect life. Render safe. 
ELDRIDGE But what if I need to change the mission - to survive? That bicyclist I told you about? I'm ninety percent sure he was an insurgent. I could have shot him. Not my mission. But it would have been legal. 
LT. COL. CAMBBRIDGE You don't have to turn into an animal just to protect yourself. 
ELDRIDGE You don't? 
LT. COL. CAMBBRIDGE No. 
ELDRIDGE And you know this from your extensive work in the field. 
LT. COL. CAMBBRIDGE I've done my field duty. 
ELDRIDGE Where was that? Yale? 
LT. COL CAMBRIDGE Look, Specialist, if you want to stop talking to me, you can. These sessions are voluntary. You chose to be here, talking to me, just like you chose the Army, just like you chose EOD. You're in an elite volunteer unit. Not many guys have the IQ or the nerves to do it. Be proud of it. 
Eldridge considers this.    The psychiatrist taps his pencil. Waiting. 
ELDRIDGE Keep the soldier in the fight and the fight in the soldier, right Doc? 
Eldridge puts out his hand, and they shake. 
ELDRIDGE Seriously, I appreciate what you're saying. But you need to get out from behind this desk more. 
INT CAMP VICTORY   LAUNDRY ROOM   NIGHT 
James is watching his clothes dry as they tumble around the machine. 
Sanborn comes in with a pile of laundry. Sees James. 
SANBORN Hey. 
JAMES Hey. 
DAYS LEFT IN BRAVO COMPANY'S ROTATION: 17 
CRATER 
James is inside a CRATER in the middle of the road, working on an EIGHT-FOOT MISSILE. He attaches A ROCKET WRENCH, a metal band with two explosive tubes, to the nose of the missile -- and flips a switch. 
The two   tubes ignite like a firecracker, shooting small flames.   Then the flames grow and band spins and FLIES off, ZIPPING   into the air above James' head like a metal frisbee, landing   fifty feet away. 
James peers into the nose cone.    A hollow void. 
SANBORN (OVER WALKIE) James? Do you copy? James? 
He climbs to the top of the crater. 
JAMES (INTO HEADSET) It's empty. 
EXT/INT CRATER   MOMENTS LATER 
The soldiers are gathered around the pit to see EOD work. It's not everyday you get to see an eight foot missile towed out of a hole. 
James is down in the pit. Sanborn hands him a chain. Working together, they wrap it around the missile. When they're done, Sanborn signals Eldridge, who is behind the wheel of the Humvee, ready to tow the missile out of the crater. 
SANBORN (TO ELDRIDGE) Rock it out, slowly. 
The chain creaks, then stops. The tires spin uselessly. 
SANBORN (CONT'D) Try gunning it. 
The tires only spin faster. 
Sanborn moves to get a closer look. His knees come very near to the creaking chain. 
JAMES (seeing this from the pit) Sanborn, watch that chain. 
SANBORN It's alright. 
When... 
KA-BOOOOM -- the sky flashes orange overhead --James flat on his back, dazed. A shard of metal ZOOMS into the pit, missing him by inches -- as the soldiers dive into the pit for cover, shouting "RPG, RPG!" 
HUMVEE 
Eldridge, who is in the driver's seat, starts shooting his M4 rifle. 
ELDRIDGE (SHOUTING) What am I shooting at? 
Sanborn jumping into the Humvee. 
SANBORN (SHOUTING BACK) I don't fucking know! -- but James is down!!! 
He fires in the same direction as Eldridge. The Humvee gets peppered with bullets. The armor holds. But it doesn't look like it's going to last for much longer. 
Sanborn grabs Eldridge. And they dive back into the pit, joining James and THREE SOLDIERS: a SERGEANT one PRIVATE and a CORPORAL who is a SNIPER. 
James is sitting up, taking off his bomb suit. He appears to be unharmed. 
ROAD 
One of the soldiers is in the turret of a Humvee, firing the big .50 machine gun in all directions. 
CRATER 
SERGEANT (TO SNIPER) Get up there with your Barret and help him out. 
[Note: Barret is the large .50 SNIPER RIFLE carried by one of the soldiers, a specialty gun with an extremely long range.] 
The SNIPER hoists the heavy gun to the edge of the crater and looks down the scope. 
As he does, Sanborn, Eldridge, and James, and the other soldiers pop up and lay down covering fire. Then they quickly pop back down. 
ROAD 
The soldier in the Humvee is still churning his machine gun, shooting in all directions, expending hundreds of bullets a minute. 
CRATER 
SNIPER (TO SERGEANT) I don't see nothing out there. Chris is shooting wild. 
SERGEANT (INTO WALKIE) Hey Chris - can you hear me? Chill out on the fifty man. 
ROAD 
The soldier in the Humvee fires a few more seconds. Picks up his walkie. 
SOLDIER (INTO WALKIE) Copy that. 
-- As a bullet hits him in the neck, killing him instantly. 
CRATER 
SNIPER Holy shit. He killed Chris. 
Everyone in the pit pops up and fires in every direction, a knee-jerk response. 
A soldier picks up his walkie and keys it. We can't hear him talking over the retorts of the soldiers firing rifles. 
The men are pinned down, paralyzed by fear. Sniper fire from one of the buildings rakes the top of the crater. 
-- Bullets kick up sand on the far side of the crater, opposite the men. 
JAMES Good. There's another one just behind him. Up a meter. 
Sanborn fires once. Audible exhale. 
JAMES Good. 
James scans the area. Silence. 
CRATER AN HOUR LATER 
The sun lower in the sky. Around the pit, the fallen soldier has been pushed to one side, and the living are hanging on to their sanity. 
Eldridge and the remaining soldier have exhausted their water supply. 
Sanborn and James are in EXACTLY the same position as when we left them. Focused. Sanborn's finger on the trigger. Sanborn breathes out, the sniper breathing. He's been doing this for an hour, time and the desert heat have taken their toll. 
Sanborn blinks sweat away. 
SANBORN POV 
The scope BLURS. He regains focus. 
JAMES 
Noticing Sanborn's fatigue. 
JAMES Eldridge, grab me the juice out of an MRE. 
Eldridge digs around the DEAD SOLDIER'S backpack and retrieves a packet of juice, which he passes to James. 
James inserts the straw into the juice pack. 
He hesitates, not sure if Sanborn will accept the gesture after all the hostility that's passed between them. But he brings the straw to Sanborn's lips. 
At first, Sanborn keeps his attention on the rifle scope. But then he opens his parched mouth, and sips. 
--Suddenly, there's movement, a flutter of fabric, in the distance off Eldridge's shoulder. He stiffens. 
ELDRIDGE Uh, Will. 
JAMES Yeah. 
ELDRIDGE At my one o'clock. Two hundred meters. Something moved behind a parked car. Either a tan dog or a man in a light-colored shirt. 
JAMES Deal with it. 
ELDRIDGE Uh--Ok. 
Eldridge looks down his scope, unsure. James keeps his focus forward on the building. 
ELDRIDGE I don't think it's a dog.   Should I fire? 
JAMES It's your call. 
Eldridge shifts his weight onto his rifle. 
There's a flutter of movement in the distance. 
Eldridge pulls the trigger. Spraying the car in the distance. Empties his entire magazine. 
From behind the car, something falls to the ground, and the tiniest sliver of a rifle clatters after it. 
The soldier in the pit comes over to Eldridge to see what he's done. 
SOLDIER Good hit, man. 
James and Sanborn don't turn around. 
Eldridge slumps, spent. 
CRATER TWO HOURS LATER 
Sun casting long shadows. 
James and Sanborn in the same focused position. Eldridge still watches the rear. 
The soldier in the pit reaches his breaking point. 
SOLDIER I'm going to go for the Humvee. What do you say? 
SERGEANT I don't know. 
SOLDIER We've been here two hours and they ain't seen nothing. I'm going to go for it. 
And with that he dashes up and out of the crater. 
Sanborn keeps his eye on the scope. 
ROAD 
The soldier runs to the Humvee, gets in, and turns the vehicle around, driving it back to the pit. 
He dives out of the vehicle and back to the pit. 
SOLDIER (EXCITED) Those fuckers are dead. 
SERGEANT What if they hit us with an RPG when we get out? What if they were just waiting for us to get in the Humvee. 
SOLDIER It's safe. I'm telling you (TO SANBORN) You got those fuckers. 
A gust of wind rattles the front door. 
SANBORN That punch was harder than I hit you. I'm owed a good one. 
JAMES Alright. 
ELDRIDGE Hold on, we need some rules. No face shots. 
James lifts off his shirt, getting into fighting mode. Eldridge picks up a marker and begins to draw a bulls-eye on James' stomach, stopping when he sees a cluster of scars. 
JAMES Beauty mark, my mother dropped me at birth. 
ELDRIDGE Looks like frag scars. 
Sanborn slugs James. James doubles over, loses his balance and falls back. James gets up, laughing so hard it hurts. Tears of laughter falling down his face. 
JAMES Ahhhh! Excellent. Now your turn. 
Sanborn braces for the blow. James gets ready to strike, then fakes a swing -- his fist stops just shy of Sanborn's cheek. 
Sanborn's eyes go wide as -- James nails him with his other hand, right in the gut -- Sanborn doubles over. 
JAMES (LAUGHING) Looks like it hurt. 
Moving forward aggressively, suddenly James looks like he could kill. A complete change in his demeanor, as wind rocks the trailer, causing the light bulb to rattle and cast a STRANGE SHADOW 
-- then James rushes Sanborn, tackling him -- they crash into the corner of the room -- in a flash James is on top of Sanborn, pinning him -- Sanborn moves to punch James but James pins his hands -- James taps Sanborn lightly on the cheek, caressing his cheek. 
JAMES There there. It'll be okay. 
SANBORN Get off of me you freak. 
Sanborn tries to buck James off. Forcefully raising his hips. 
JAMES Oh yeah, ride me, ride me. 
Sanborn reaches for his boot knife. He flicks it open, brings the blade to James' throat. Their eyes lock. James dismounts, laughing. Stumbles back to the table. 
JAMES You're alright, Sanborn. Let's have another. 
CUT TO: 
EXT CAMP VICTORY   LATER 
The wind is blowing harder, kicking up sand. Overhead, a full moon is blazing. 
James looks up at the moon. It's dazzling. James and Eldridge support Sanborn as they weave towards Eldridge's trailer. 
JAMES I got him. 
Eldridge passes Sanborn off to James, and heads up the stairs to his trailer. 
ELDRIDGE Later. 
Sanborn sags. James pulls him back. They walk a little farther to Sanborn's trailer -- 
JAMES Okay. Here we go big boy. 
And half carries Sanborn up the steps. 
INT. SANBORN'S TRAILER 
James eases Sanborn onto a cot, and as he falls onto the cot, the WHITE ENVELOPE falls out of his pocket. 
SANBORN Do you think I have what it takes to get in the bomb suit? 
James didn't expect this. 
JAMES Sure. 
James picks up the white envelope and puts it on Sanborn's night table. 
He looks back. Sanborn is already asleep. 
EXT   CAMP VICTORY   AFTER MIDNIGHT 
The whole camp is asleep but James is standing outside, holding a satellite phone. He's swaying. Drunk. 
CONNIE O.S. (SLEEPILY) James, my God, what time is it? Are you alright. 
Pause. 
CONNIE O.S. James? 
JAMES (SLIGHTLY SLURRED) I'm doing fine, babe. How are you? 
CONNIE O.S. Well, you woke me up. But - ah - we - we're fine. (getting more lively) Will junior said "bobba" He means bottle, but he's talking, Will. 
James looks around the camp. All he sees is its immensity, the tremendous scope of the operation. This is military might, raw power. As good as it gets. 
JAMES Great. I'll call you tomorrow when you're awake. 
CONNIE O.S. Will, I can't wait until you come home. 
Silence. 
CONNIE (CONT'D) Will? 
JAMES (trying his best to mean IT) Yeah, me too. 
JAMES What the hell does that mean? 
ELDRIDGE Healthy. 
JAMES You're healthy? Well, why not. 
They go back to eating. 
Sanborn joins James and Eldridge. 
SANBORN What's up team? 
They nod silently as he sits. Sluggishly he throws his hand down on the table. 
SANBORN Can I get a Huu-haa? 
Eldridge slaps a tired hand on top of Sanborn's. James follows suit. They wearily lift their arms in mock enthusiasm. 
All at once:   "Huu-haa." 
Sanborn wolfs down some food. 
JAMES I'm going back to sleep now. 
ELDRIDGE Let's roll. 
They get up to bus their trays. And nearing the dirty-tray bin, the flaps of the tent billow more and more vigorously. Outside, a storm is brewing. 
Each man unfurls the checkered scarf around their neck and wraps their face for the wind. 
EXT CAMP VICTORY    DAY 
Wind rakes sand and dust over the tent city, giving it an otherworldly aspect. Throngs of men and vehicles fight the swirl. It impedes their every move. 
The three men continue onwards, as the intensity of the storm grows. 
EXT HEAD SHED DAY 
The storm is HOWLING now. Visibility is reduced to a few feet. Red sand blows mercilessly. It's Mars. 
TITLE OVER: 
DAYS LEFT IN BRAVO COMPANY'S ROTATION: 16 
As they approach the head shed, a Humvee comes blasting out of the storm from the other direction. It skids to a halt in front of them. 
Three wounded EOD TECHS and an EOD TEAM LEADER tumble out. 
They look awful. One step shy of death. One man's face is smeared brown. Blood oozes from a deep gash in his cheek. Another tech is covered in black soot. Their hands still clutch their weapons -- the battle still wages in their minds. 
TEAM LEADER (shouting to James) It was a car bomb. Fucking nasty one -- they had a decoy detonator set up so that when I disarmed it nothing happened -- then, I'm walking back uprange to get some more tools and boooom!!! If I hadn't been wearing the suit, I'd be dead right now. 
ELDRIDGE Get a Medic to look at your cheek. 
The wounded TEAM LEADER touches his face and blood smears on his hand...he looks down...surreal to see your own blood. The First Sergeant trots over. 
TEAM LEADER (amazed at the sight of HIS BLOOD) ) It's no big deal. (now turning his attention back to James) ) Be careful. They're starting to hide the detonator really well. 
The FIRST SERGEANT turns his attention to James: 
FIRST SERGEANT Sorry to ruin your day off, but your team is up. 
James blinks back sand and dust blowing into his eyes. 
So much for the nap. 
INT HUMVEE    CAMP VICTORY   PARKING LOT 
Lt. COL. CAMBRIDGE knocks on the window. Startling the men. His face appears in the sand storm. 
LT. COL. CAMBRIDGE (SHOUTING) Are you guys about to go out? 
JAMES Yeah. 
LT. COL. CAMBRIDGE Mind if I ride along? I'm sick to death of sitting behind a desk all the time. 
James shoots Eldridge a look.   Eldridge shrugs. 
JAMES Anytime, Sir. It's a privilege. 
The LT. COL. CAMBRIDGE gets in. As they drive out. 
JAMES Don't mean to insult your intelligence, Sir. But if the shit hits the fan, please don't fire out of these windows. They're bullet proof and the round will just bounce around the cabin. 
EXT. ABU GRAIB CENTER   BOMBED OUT BUILDING   DAY 
A partially destroyed building fills the screen. A mess of bricks and rebar. Wind swirls sand up into the air. 
Nearby, an OLD IRAQI MAN with a DONKEY drawn cart is unloading new bricks to repair the building. 
Farther up the road, a good distance from the building, are two parked Humvees. Nearby, James and his team are talking to a small cluster of SOLDIERS. 
SOLDIER 1 (pointing back at the BUILDING) Right up those stairs. 
JAMES You been inside already? 
SOLDIER 1 In there? Fuck no. We've had reports of all kinds of shit coming out of that house -- and-- 
James takes his eyes off the building and turns to the Soldier. 
GUARD Are you cleared to leave the camp through this gate, Sir? 
James nods. 
GUARD I'm going to need to see your ID again. 
JAMES Don't fuck with me man, I'm having a bad day already. 
The guard stares at James. James stares at the guard. The guard shrugs, waves James through. 
EXT BAGHDAD STREET     NIGHT 
The truck goes down a series of streets. It comes into a poor neighborhood and stops at a house. 
DVD MAN Pele. 
JAMES Wait here. 
James gets out. 
EXT BAGHDAD STREET     HOUSE 
The dwelling is set back behind a low wall. Hard to see much of it in the dim light. 
James takes a step forward, toward the wall. 
SUDDENLY-- 
the DVD truck peels out. 
James looks at its retreating tail lights. A moment of indecision as he considers his situation: alone in Baghdad. 
Then he vaults the low wall, landing in 
EXT BAGHDAD COURTYARD 
A modest courtyard. Light comes from one window in the house, the rest is dark. Crickets. 
James walks around to the back of the house. There's a door. He tries the knob. It opens. 
INT IRAQI HOUSE      HALLWAY 
In a dark hallway. Murmuring of a television. James moves towards the noise. 
INT IRAQI HOUSE   ANTECHAMBER 
James comes to an antechamber. Behind it is a very low stone archway. He goes through the archway, where - 
INT IRAQI HOUSE   LIVING ROOM 
A MAN -- call him Kalim -- older, fifties, dressed in traditional garb, sits at a table drinking tea, watching an Egyptian game show on television. 
James walks in, gun drawn. 
The man is spooked. He spills his tea, looks wildly for an exit. 
James puts his fingers to his lips. 
JAMES Do you speak English? 
KALIM English, French, Arabic. 
JAMES (QUIETLY) I want the people responsible for Pele. 
KALIM For whom? 
JAMES Pele. The body bomb. 
KALIM Pele? I don't know. But please sit down. I am professor Kalim, this is my home. You are a guest. Sit. 
JAMES Take me to the people responsible. 
KALIM Of course, whatever you seek, I will help you find. Please, please sit, down. You are CIA, no? I am very pleased to have CIA in my home. 
James raises his gun to aim at the man's face. 
JAMES Maybe you don't understand? 
The man is suddenly very afraid. 
KALIM Please, be careful. Be slow. A gun can go off. 
As the back door opens 
-- James spins to see 
-- a WOMAN, older, matronly. She sees James, his gun. And she starts shouting at James in Arabic, then English, "Get out, get out." 
James swings his gun to her. 
SUDDENLY-- 
-- behind the woman comes Pele. He runs to his father's side. 
-- James turns to the boy, to say something -- 
-- his mother is rushing James now, swinging a candlestick 
-- he spins to the door, trying to get out of there -- 
Two soldiers run past them, carrying a stretcher. 
SANBORN Hey. 
They stop to see what he's looking at. Twisted metal. 
SANBORN That's an engine block. A big one, too. From a truck probably. 
JAMES Oil tanker? 
SANBORN It's what I'm thinking. 
The men keep walking, and now the SOUNDS from the Inferno are louder. 
Another man rushes towards them, his face shrouded in blackness. 
Sanborn points his rifle at the man's head. Hits him with the Hi-Beam of his light. The man is wearing a black wool ski mask. 
SANBORN Stop! Wagef! Wagef! 
SKI MASKED MAN No. I am working here. 
Sanborn looks at him. Doesn't reply. 
James puts his gun up on the guy. Now Eldridge does too. This guy is about to be toast. 
When... 
A face appears next to him. 
FACE He's with me. 
Guns cover the face... 
Then they see that above the face is a helmet... 
And on the top of the helmet is a COLONEL'S INSIGNIA. 
COLONEL REED Okay fellas? 
JAMES Sorry, Sir. I didn't recognize you. 
Guns are lowered, fast. 
Now that the Colonel is fully visible in the light we can see that he's shaken by the scene of destruction around him. 
COLONEL REED We haven't found a body so it could be a suicide bomber or some clever bastard that caused all this -- and slipped away to sip tea with his mommie -- we just don't know. 
As the Colonel struggles to define the horror he's just seen, James jumps in to save him: 
JAMES We'll take a close look, Sir. 
COLONEL REED This kind of situation we may never know what happened. This is a mass casualty situation - terrible destruction. 
JAMES Roger that, Sir. We'll do our best. 
A stretcher comes by. 
COLONEL REED They're cowards, you know. I wish they would stand up and fight us, man to man, instead of playing hide and seek with me. 
JAMES Roger, Sir. We better get moving. 
COLONEL REED Right, go ahead Sergeant. 
The Colonel nods and moves off. His translator stands for a moment. Takes off his ski mask to reveal an intelligent face with deep set eyes and a dirty smear of five o'clock shadow. 
SKI MASKED MAN I'm Ahmed. My name is Ahmed. Thank you for not shooting me. 
The men move on... 
Advancing toward the plume of smoke and embers rising into the sky...smell of burning rubber and charred metal... 
...until they see it -- 
--the twisted steel carcasses of two small vehicles and a TANKER. 
The image is biblical - the wounded and dead piled together in one Hieronymus Bosch maze of tangled limbs, body parts... 
Palm trees burning at the top...like Olympic torches. 
SOLDIERS secure the area.   GRIEVING FAMILIES swarm around the dead and dying -- 
James, Sanborn and Eldridge approach. Wind fans nearby flames into a fountain of embers that float up into the black desert night. 
James moves through charred metal, stumbling over something sharp. 
-- then something hits his leg... What? Flashlight, gun -- DOWN! -- it's a CHICKEN, charred -- feathers burned off but still walking around - disoriented, dying... 
James stumbles sideways to avoid the charred hens... 
SOUNDS distant and near of wailing, MEDICS racing onto the SCENE -- 
A WOMAN wearing Bhurka appears out of the distant flames and haze -- looking disoriented, in apparent state of shock -- 
SANBORN 
A BODY lies trapped beneath a pile of rubble. Sanborn reaches down to remove one of the chunks of stone. It slides away, but another falls in its place. 
ELDRIDGE 
There's no answer. 
WALL 
SANBORN He's gone. 
They both drop to the ground on the other side. 
They scan the ground with their flashlights. 
The BODY of an Iraqi insurgent is lying close to where Eldridge had been standing. He's pulped from bullet wounds, and gasping for breath. 
JAMES This guy comes out of the dark - Eldridge shoots. 
He scavenges the ground looking for brass casings. 
Nothing. 
SANBORN Three shots, close range. He takes a step forward to see what he's hit. 
JAMES Another guy comes from behind him -- gets the drop on him. You're a hostage. 
They look up and down the wall. 
SANBORN That way is towards the tanker, troops. 
DARK STREET 
They run about fifty yards when Sanborn TRIPS, stumbles, James catches him as he falls, and they keep going. 
In the distance, they see Eldridge's back and the backs of two other MEN, just as they are turning a corner. 
They SPRINT to the corner, and pause to catch their breath as James hands Sanborn his flashlight. 
JAMES Hit `em with both lights on three. 
SANBORN Fuck. Okay. 
JAMES One. Two. 
Sanborn shoulders his rifle and readies both spotlights. 
JAMES Three. 
They spin around the corner - flash of light revealing NOTHING but an empty street. 
They sprint to the next block, where Eldridge is being walked quickly at gun point. 
The men's rifles are at his head. 
JAMES Again. One two three. Do it. Do it. 
Sanborn shines the lights on the backs of both men. 
James fires. Three shots at the guy on the left of Eldridge. Three shots at the guy on the right. 
Sanborn kills the flashlights. 
James goes running towards the group, Sanborn running next to him. Both have their guns up but lights off. 
They get to the group and all three men are on the ground. Both Iraqis are dead -- shot clean in the back. 
Eldridge is bleeding profusely from his leg, but he's alive. 
James and Sanborn pick Eldridge up and drudge back with him. 
ELDRIDGE Am I dead? 
JAMES No. You're fine. 
ELDRIDGE Am I dead? Am I dead? Am I dead? 
Off James' face -- 
INT   CAMP VICTORY SHOWER STALLS   LATER THAT NIGHT 
James walks in. The room is empty. Florescent lights hum. James is still wearing his fatigues. His whole midsection is red with Eldridge's blood. 
James heads to the shower and steps inside, fully clothed. He turns on the water. 
Aims the shower head to his stomach. Sinks down so it can hit the bloody stains. 
As the uniform grows wet, then gets soaked, the pinkish water swirls down the drain -- 
EXT   CAMP VICTORY   FIRST SERGEANT'S TRAILER 
James and Sanborn emerge into the wind. 
SANBORN So how you doing with this? 
JAMES Fine. I'm fine. 
SANBORN Fine? You know I lied to our sergeant. (MORE) 
SANBORN (CONT'D) So Eldridge wouldn't have to go around saying he was shot by his own team leader. 
JAMES Yeah. Thanks. I'm just tired. 
SANBORN You want some sleeping pills? 
UPRANGE 
SANBORN (RELIEVED) Copy that. 
--When, suddenly, the SOUND of SOLDIERS SHOUTING in the distance catches Sanborn's ear. 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Hustle back, something's going on. 
MOMENTS LATER 
James comes back sweating profusely from his run. Sanborn helps take his helmet off. 
As two SOLDIERS come running over. More SHOUTING in the distance, louder now. "Hands on your head." "Don't move asshole." "Stop. Stop." 
In addition, the sound of SHOUTING IN ARABIC. A loud jumble. 
Over that, SOLDIERS YELLING: "Get back." "Form a perimeter." 
A NERVOUS SOLDIER trots up to James and Sanborn. 
JAMES What's going on? 
NERVOUS SOLDIER We've got a situation with a suicide bomber. 
JAMES We'll follow you. 
They follow the soldier down the road. The soldier is sweating, terrified. 
EXT   BAGHDAD ROAD 
The road has been cordoned off by SOLDIERS on all sides. 
In the middle of the road an IRAQI MAN IN A NEW BLACK SUIT is standing with his hands above his head. He's distraught. Hair mussed. 
A SERGEANT seems to have taken command of the situation, and now he alone is shouting to the man. "Stay still. Don't Move. If you keep walking we will shoot you." 
A TRANSLATOR in a black ski mask is helping him get the message across. 
The translator edges forward to talk to the BLACK SUIT man. 
SERGEANT Keep that translator back. 
One of the soldiers grabs the translator. 
TRANSLATOR (to the soldier) But the bomb was forced on him. Against his will. He is not a bad man! 
James and Sanborn and the NERVOUS SOLDIER come onto the scene. 
The Sergeant turns to James and explains. 
SERGEANT He came walking up to our checkpoint, said he had a bomb strapped to him. He was sorry. He didn't want it to blow up. He begged us to take it off him. 
TRANSLATOR (TO JAMES) Help this man. He's not a bad man. 
SANBORN Not a bad man? You've got to be kidding me. (TO JAMES) This is a trap. He wants to draw people close to him. 
JAMES (TO TRANSLATOR) Tell him to open his jacket. I need to see the bomb. 
The translator SHOUTS in Arabic and the MAN unbuttons his jacket, revealing several sticks of dynamite strapped to his chest. 
JAMES (to the soldier) With that much bang, I'd need a hundred meter perimeter. (TO TRANSLATOR) Tell him to get on his knees. 
The translator SHOUTS. BLACK SUIT complies. 
SERGEANT Can we just shoot him? 
As James considers that option when -- 
TRANSLATOR NO. He's not a bad man. He has a family. The bomb was forced on him. He is asking for help. Only help. 
JAMES (TO TRANSLATOR) I want you one hundred meters away, like everybody else. 
TRANSLATOR But how will I hear? 
JAMES You don't need to. I'm going down there. 
Meanwhile, the BLACK SUIT man is SHOUTING something in Arabic. 
JAMES (TO TRANSLATOR) What the fuck is he shouting now? 
TRANSLATOR He's asking you to hurry. He thinks the bomb has a timer on it. 
James turns to Sanborn 
JAMES Where's that helmet? 
Sanborn pulls James aside. 
SANBORN We've had our differences. Eldridge? That's water under the bridge. It happened. But this -- this is suicide. 
James smiles at Sanborn. He just doesn't get it. 
JAMES That's why it's called a suicide bomb. 
SANBORN It's suicide for you, Will. 
JAMES Nah. That guy wants to catch an American? I'll give him an American. 
Sanborn reluctantly hands him his helmet, and seals him in. 
--Down the road, sprinting now. Rifle flapping. 
DOWNRANGE 
Sanborn skids to a halt, hands James the cutters. 
James hands his gun to Sanborn, who holds it on the man's forehead. 
James sets to work, applying the cutters to the thick metal holding the bomb to his chest. 
The man is crying now. 
Sanborn sees the Casio. It reads 4:00 
SANBORN Holy shit. You weren't kidding. 
JAMES Nope. 
James works the cutter blade. 
CU: Bolt Cutter. It SCRAPS futilely against the metal. 
JAMES (SOTTO) What is this made out of? 
BLACK SUIT Please. Please. 
SANBORN Case hardened steel. 
James doubles his effort. 
CU: Bolt Cutter. The blade bites the steel, but it doesn't give. 
James squeezes with all his might. 
JAMES Motherfucker. What's our time? 
Sanborn looks at the Casio. 
SANBORN Three minutes. 
JAMES Shit. Ok. Let me think. 
He puts the bolt cutter down on the ground. 
JAMES We'd need an arc welder to get this off properly. 
SANBORN I don't think we have one of those in the truck. 
CU: Casio Watch 2:30. 
JAMES Let's try the back of it. 
Sanborn nods. Keeps the gun on the man's head. His hand is starting to shake. 
James goes behind the man, and rips open the back of his shirt, revealing the back of the bomb. Here too it is a welded band, but the metal looks thinner. Weaker. 
James works it with the cutter. 
CU: Casio Watch 1:30. 
SANBORN We have to bail. 
JAMES Go. I got the suit. 
Sanborn looks at the guy. 
SANBORN What do you want me to do with the pistol? 
JAMES Take it with you, that's a good pistol. 
SANBORN When do you leave? 
JAMES In forty five seconds. 
Sanborn turns, and begins running uprange. 
SANBORN (shouting to soldiers) Get back! Get back! 
The soldiers turn and run. 
James tries and tries to clip the metal. It's a no go. He comes around to face the man. 
JAMES I'm sorry. 
BLACK SUIT Please, please. 
JAMES The metal is too thick. 
BLACK SUIT Help me. Help me! 
James drops the bolt cutter, kneels down in front of the man, and shakes his head. That's it. 
The man understands James' gesture. He reaches forward, grabbing James' suit. 
BLACK SUIT No! No! 
James clubs his hand away. 
JAMES Sorry. 
JAMES This traffic is pissing me off. 
SANBORN Where are we, anyway? 
JAMES I know where I am but I'm lost. 
They drive on.   Dust off the desert floor blows into the WINDSHIELD -- 
TIME CUT TO: 
INT   KNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE   SUPERMARKET   DAY 
A big one. Vast, hyper-hygenic, the aisles stretching on, loaded with glistening produce. Muzac. A cathedral to consumerism. 
We find James walking through the supermarket, looking like a new man. His hair has grown, softening his features. He's scrubbed clean, dust free, and dressed in Bermuda shorts and a clashing Polo shirt. The All American Dad. A suburban softie. Pushing a shopping cart. 
Welcome home, son, for you are no longer in Baghdad.     You're in the "big PX" -- America. 
A beautiful young WOMAN approaches him from the other end of the aisle. She too, is pushing a shopping cart, and in it is a small BOY. She smiles at James, and says: 
YOUNG WOMAN Honey, you grab the barbecue sauce and I'll meet you in aisle four. 
And CONNIE JAMES smiles again, and pats her husband on the shoulder. 
Now James knows he's really home. 
JAMES 
Pushes the cart over to the sauce section. Down the squeaky- clean aisle. 
His progress is impeded by an OBESE WOMAN who is mulling over cat litter. Her overflowing cart blocks the aisle. 
James stops. Hands tight on the shopping cart. He looks at her hard. She ignores him. Where's the 9mm when you need it? 
James clears his throat. She sees him. Moves her cart. 
He continues on, walking through the cavernous space. 
At last, he's at the sauce section. He is rattled by the abundance after the bleakness of Iraq, and the array of choices is dizzying. 
--He reaches for a bottle, then pulls back, unsure. 
--Giving up, he picks a bottle at random and tosses it into the cart. 
INT KNOXVILLE   JAMES HOUSE   KITCHEN   MORNING SOME DAYS LATER 
James is washing the vegetables they've just bought at the grocery store. Mushrooms bob in a pool of water at the bottom of the sink. James tries to clean them individually, but can't. They crumble in his hands. 
CONNIE Let's put the chicken on first and the vegetables on last, so they don't burn? 
James struggles with the mushrooms. Makes no reply. 
CONNIE CONT'D Will? 
JAMES Yeah, okay. (beat) You know, they're really short on bomb techs over there. 
Connie knows where this is going, but she fights the inevitable. 
CONNIE Well, good thing the army is hiring, and they've got so many great guys over there. 
JAMES Uh-huh. 
James wipes his hands on the dish towel and walks out. Looking at his retreating back, she accidentally knocks a glass off the counter, and it shatters. 
EXT   JAMES HOUSE    LATER THAT DAY 
A few NEIGHBORS have gathered for a barbecue in James' backyard. It's a simple, low-key affair. James is tending meat on a grill. 
INT   JAMES HOUSE    CONTINUOUS 
The doorbell rings. Connie rushes to open it. It's Sanborn. She hugs him. 
CONNIE Thanks for coming. Maybe he'll listen to you. 
SANBORN I know how to talk to him. 
EXT   JAMES HOUSE    A LITTLE LATER 
Behind the barbecue, Sanborn finds a moment to confront James privately. 
SANBORN What the fuck is the matter with you? You got a family, kid, nice looking burgers. 
James studies the grilling meat. 
JAMES I know, it's crazy. So how's life at home treating you? 
Sanborn holds up his hand. He's wearing a wedding ring. 
SANBORN I made the plunge. (big smile) But I thought we were talking about you. 
JAMES We just did, buddy. 
INT   JAMES' SON'S BEDROOM   LATER THAT NIGHT 
The boy is in a cradle, face up and wide awake. James comes in to tuck him in. 
James pulls a book of fairy tales off the shelf, flips through it. Can't read that fluff. 
He pulls up a chair. Begins to play with a Jack-In-the-Box. He winds it up.

GLADYS Oh, my! (waving out window) Hello, Father Donigan!  Sidewalks, sidewalks? 
Iris mimes drinking, "glug, glug."

IRIS That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ. 
EXT. MALL OF AMERICA 
In the vast, already full parking lot, we see Gladys Leeman's station wagon searching for a parking spot. 
IRIS Oh, there's a parking space over there.  Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL REBECCA LEEMAN stands in front of Amber and addresses the camerman (O.S.).

INT. GUN RANGE 
Becky, in shooting goggles and ear muffs, FIRES a Glock- 17 9mm pistol with both hands.  Sign on wall reads: "Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club."  (See Iona in b.g. with an arsenal of sniper weaponry.)

Becky stops firing and takes off her hear muffs.

CHLORIS (cont'd) Yeah, you boys sure picked a good year.  If I was a betting woman, and there was a line on this in Vegas, I'd lay down ten-to-one that it all comes down to Amber Atkins and Becky Leeman. Oh, sweet Jesus, what a showdown this could be if Cain and Abel... 
The SOUND RECORDIST enters and Lisa spins out of control, taking him out.  She leans over and comforts him.

MARY (labored breaths) ...Amber does my hair...once a week. 
AMBER (flattered and embarrassed) Well...it's the least I can do for the reigning Mount Rose Junior Miss Amer-- 
Amber pulls the brush away with a clump of Mary's hair dangling from it. 
AMBER (cont'd) Oh God... 
MARY What? 
AMBER Huh?  Oh...Uh, just a little snarl... 
Amber mouths, "Shhh!  Don't tell!" to camera as she tries to pull the clump of hair from the brush.

But we're inside my home now and I've gotta warn you, I'm wearin' my "wife apron" and "mom hat."  So, I can safely say that I'm the mother of the most talented contestant Mount Rose has ever seen. 
JUMP CUT TO:

JOHN I'm just out here watching the young girls - contestants - like the rest of my friends and neighbors...

PAT (re: Amber) Are you gettin' her?  Uh, the third one, the blonde one.

Brett slaps Pat on the back. 
BRETT Leave him alone, leave him alone. It's okay. 
EXT. CHLORIS KLINHAGEN'S HOUSE - FRONT LAWN 
John, his car hood open, is caught aiming his video camera at the girls performing a dance.  They wear partially constructed U.S. Monument Headdresses.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - KITCHEN 
Move through kitchen.  LUNCH LADIES haul, serve and prepare food.  Pan over to Amber, who's unhappily scraping and spraying lunch trays as they're dropped off at her window.  Becky, flirting her ass off, comes to the window with Brett, handsome football player we saw before.  Both carry trays. 
BECKY So, Brett, do you wanna go to the lake with me on Thursday? 
BRETT Um, actually, I got practice on Thursday. 
BECKY ...Yah-well, maybe Friday, then.  A bunch of us were gonna go cow-tippin'. 
SUPER: BRETT CLEMMENS, CAPTAIN, MOUNT ROSE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM 
BRETT (seeing Amber) Uh, I-uh-I'm kinda busy Friday. 
Amber looks up to see Brett looking at her.  He smiles. She smiles.  You can feel the attraction.  Amber becomes girlishly self-conscious -- adjusting her rubber apron and brushing hair out of her eyes with her big rubber gloves. 
BRETT (cont'd) (to Amber) Hi... 
AMBER Hi. 
Becky notices their attraction and goes from flirt to uber-bitch in a heartbeat. 
BECKY Giver her your tray, Brett.  You're holdin' up the line. 
Brett looks at Beck, then at Amber, not wanting to make her clean his tray. 
BRETT Uh... 
BECKY Give it to her! 
A visibly upset Amber still applies make-up to Brett. 
AMBER Yah-sure, Tammy liked to driver her dad's thresher - she said the heavy vibration helped her think, y'know? But I know for a fact she only smoked after a good drive.  You ask me or anyone else who isn't scared to talk about it - Tammy was murdered. (holding back tears) God, I bet Diane Sawyer never had to deal with crap like this... (to crew guy) Toss me "Caucasian #5," would ya? 
A crew guy walks IN FRAME and hands her a make-up jar. 
AMBER (cont'd) Man, I can't wait for fishin' season... 
Mr. Larson bursts in, white as a corpse. 
MR. LARSON Amber...

She grabs the keys and RUNS OUT. 
EXT. TRAILER PARK STREET/INT. HEARSE - NIGHT 
Amber drives fast and furious as we come to what's left of her trailer.  All the NEIGHBORS are out drinkin' beers, eatin' food and watchin' the excitement. 
AMBER Oh my God - no!  Is my mom okay?  Was she home? 
Hearse SCREECHES to a halt.  We hear a THUD, then MOANS from in back.  Amber jumps out.  Camera follows, a la "COPS."  It's pandemonium with fire trucks, neighbors, an ambulance, etc. 
AMBER (cont'd) Mom!  Mom!?  MOMMMM! 
Loretta runs up to Amber as TWO FIREMEN approach. 
FIREMAN #1 You family? 
LORETTA No, she's just screamin' "Mom, Mom!" kcause she's got Tourettes... She's Annette's kid, dipshit. 
AMBER (to Loretta) Is Mom okay? 
LORETTA She's alive, sweetie. 
AMBER Where is she?! 
LORETTA She's right over there. 
Camera pans over to see a semi-conscious Annette as they load her stretcher into the ambulance, shut the doors and start to pull away.  Amber runs after them. 
AMBER Mommmm!  I'll be right behind you in the hearse! 
LORETTA Don't let that worry you, Annette! 
EST. SHOT - FARMINGTON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.) So, doctor, is this sort of an unusual injury here? 
DOCTOR Oh you betcha, this was a doozy. Right now, our chief concern is to stabilize Annette, then, in surgery, remove this here. 
Removing BANDAGE to reveal BEER CAN, still held in her hand. 
AMBER Oh, Mom, it's so ugly. 
ANNETTE Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons. (weak) Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY!  Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window.  Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.

AMBER Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I- I'm not goin' through this again. 
ANNETTE You're not goin' through this again? You?  You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels. 
AMBER Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary. 
ANNETTE Let me tell you "scary," Amber.  Look at me.  Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age?  I'm a "lifer" here.  Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day. 
AMBER That's it, I'm goin'... 
ANNETTE Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you... 
Amber sits on the bed. 
AMBER God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'. 
ANNETTE (smiling) It's me...I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over.  This pageant's your ticket outta here.  I know you can win, Amber.

Annette hugs Amber. 
INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

LORETTA Hell-no, she ain't quittin'. 
AMBER No.  Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him. 
DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.) So has your mom kept your dad's life a secret? 
AMBER No.  She never hid the fact that my dad picked his career over us.  What'd she used to say? 
LORETTA "Once a carnie, always a carnie." 
AMBER Oh-yah. EXT. MOUNT ROSE STREET - MORNING 
The twin officers lean against their car. 
TWIN OFFICER #1 The Atkins fire?  Foul play?  Shit-no. After some thorough investigatin', we determined it musta been a bad wirin'. Mosta them trailer-folk plug a TV, VCR, crock pot and Fry-daddy into one outlet and don't think nothin' of it ktil KABLEWEY! 
TWIN OFFICER #2 (taking a pinch of Skoal) Not enough left to fill a tin. 
INT. HOSPITAL - ANNETTE'S ROOM - DAY 
Annette is in bad shape. The candy striper nervously stands beside her, holding a syringe. 
ANNETTE "Bad wirin'?!"  Well, if that ain't the biggest crock-a-shit ever. (turning on the candy striper) Ooowwww-Jesus!  Did K-Mart have a sale on dull needles? 
CANDY STRIPER I-I just need one more "do-over."

Follow the contestants up to the door. 
JANELLE Thank you. 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - DAY 
ON STAGE "Through the Eyes of Love" plays as Janelle performs her INTERPRETATIVE DANCE while signing the words.  In the f.g., Gladys appears very serious. 
GLADYS (loud whisper) I'll be honest.  This is a hard time for me.  This is the part of the pageant when you realize that tomorrow night, all but one of these girls will walk out of here a loser.  It's hard for me to know how that must feel, but I'm sure it doesn't feel good. 
In b.g., a BIG STAGE LIGHT FALLS on Janelle's head. CRASH!  Gladys and CAMERA rush the stage.  "Through the Eyes of Love" continues throughout. 
EXT. LORETTA'S TRAILER - PORCH - THAT NIGHT 
A very shaken Amber paces. 
AMBER Don't you get it?  I was supposed to go first.  I was contestant number one.  That light was meant for my head.  If Janelle hadn't wanted to change numbers... God, I owe my life to that deaf baby. 
Loretta enters, portable phone and drink in hand. 
LORETTA That was your mom.  She wanted you to have this. 
AMBER (taking drink) Really, Loretta? 
LORETTA (avoiding eye contact) You-betcha. 
AMBER My mom wanted me to have this? 
LORETTA Oh, shut up.  I thought it might help you get some sleep. 
AMBER Loretta, never have kids. 
LORETTA Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could. 
Loretta pulls a bag out of a closet and hands it to Amber. 
LORETTA (cont'd) Here, your ma did want you to have this since your other one got toasted and all. 
Amber pulls out an ELEGANT GREEN GOWN. 
AMBER Oh...my...God!  It's just like Diane Sawyer's!  kCourse it's not a size ten, Diane was a little hippy back then.  Oh, thank you!  Thank you! Thank you! 
She hugs Loretta.

Laughter and applause trail off. 
GLADYS (cont'd) Welcome to the Mount Rose American Teen Princess Pageant.  While every contestant you'll meet tonight is special and unique, they all have one thing in common.  They're all "Proud - to - be - an - American!" 
Wild applause!  Jazzy patriotic medley tape.  Gym doors fly open and like a Felliniesque Vegas review, CONTESTANTS enter wearing gowns and U.S. Monument Headdresses.  They struggle to maintain balance as they dance, moving only their arms, on stage. 
AMBER You heard me.  Where is it? 
The other contestants slowly clear a path between them. 
BECKY If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it. 
AMBER I just did. 
BECKY Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, kcause you're talkin' like crazy. 
They start to slowly circle each other - a cat fight's brewin'. 
AMBER Oh-oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky - bring it on. 
BECKY Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch! 
AMBER Oh, I'll "get it."  I'll "get it" all right.  I might even take seconds. 
They're moving ever closer... 
BECKY If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya. 
AMBER Bitch! 
IRIS (stepping between them) Girls!  Girls! 
BECKY Give me your stringy-ass hair! 
AMBER I'll get you! 
CREW GUY (O.S.) (barely audible) Oh God, don't stop kem now... 
BECKY You're choking my, you fucking bitch! 
IRIS (putting hand over camera) Y'know, I-I don't think yous boys should, uh, should be in here while the girls are changin'. 
AMBER I hate her! 
IRIS We all do.  Now let's go. 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM 
Gladys is center stage. 
GLADYS Yah-so how kbout a big round of applause for last year's Mount Rose American Teen Princess, in a farewell performance.  Who could forget her lip- synching to "Don't Cry Out Loud," by Melissa Manchester.  And here she is, Mary Johanson! 
Applause!  Gladys exits.  TAPED MUSIC "It's My Turn."  A NURSE pushes MARY JOHANSON out in her wheelchair, complete with portable oxygen.  Mary wears a gigantic black wig and silver gown which hangs off her boney body. She moves her lips to the words as the nurse pushes her emotionally around the stage. 
EXT. GYMNASIUM - HALLWAY 
Contestants, in "physical fitness" outfits, wait outside the double doors, holding freshly painted red, white and blue step ladders.  Becky and Amber stare at each other from opposite ends of the line. 
IRIS All right, why don't we take up the stepladders, all right?  For the Physical Fitness number? 
BECKY (picking up her stool) They're wet. 
LISA Hey, my hands are stuck. 
MOLLY (sniffing) Uh, I'm kinda dizzy from the fumes. 
IRIS Well, hold kem away from you so it doesn't get on the outfits. (turning to Servettes) What kinda mental retard paints step ladders the morning of a pageant. 
ON STAGE 
Hank is being pulled off stage by Harold.  Gladys adjusts her dress, frazzled. 
HANK (under throughout) Here come the judge - pinch, pinch - here come the judge - pinch, pinch - here come the judge... 
GLADYS Get back!  Get back, you total retard! 
LORETTA Go Hank! 
CHLORIS No.  Here. 
Chloris pulls a simple BLACK LEOTARD from the bag. 
CHLORIS (cont'd) It's nothin' special, but talent like yours doesn't need to hide behind sequins. 
AMBER Mrs. K-- 
CHLORIS You're... you're special and... Ah hell, go out there and kick some Leeman ass. 
Amber, overcome with joy, gives her a big hug. 
CHLORIS (cont'd) Not so hard, sweetie.  I heard somethin' snap... 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM 
ON STAGE: Leslie Miller, in uniform, performs an amazingly sexy cheer as TWO SINGLET-CLAD WRESTLERS wrestle (One is boyfriend, Pat.). 
LESLIE Roll him over -- (clap, clap, clap) Lay him flat (clap, clap, clap) Pin his shoulders (clap, clap, clap) To the mat (clap, clap, clap) Roll him over, lay him flat, pin his shoulders, to the mat!  Yeahhhh! 
She JUMPS, KICKS and ends with SPLITS.  APPLAUSE! 
JUMP CUT TO: 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - LATER 
Michelle Johanson is on stage, sitting on a stool, wearing all black.  She smiles warmly.  Then, with one sweep of her hand across her face, her smile drops. She's dead serious. 
MICHELLE (without emotion) Fade in...Earth.  The year is two- thousand twenty-four.  The question on everyone's mind:  What is...Soylent Green? 
She sweeps her hand back across her face and she's "in character," pained, near death, and overly dramatic. 
BACKSTAGE - LEFT - CONTINUOUS 
Amber, now in the leotard, talks to Iris.  Michelle performs from "Soylent Green" in the b.g. 
AMBER (loud whisper) Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me?  Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on? 
IRIS Amber, I'm sorry.  I really am.  But you know the rules.  All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant. 
AMBER But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule? 
IRIS Sorry.  I-I don't make the rules. 
AMBER This, this... This is bullshit! 
IRIS Amber Atkins!  That is not American Teen Princess language! 
AMBER Good, kcause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant - it's, it's Nazi Germany! 
Amber storms off. 
IRIS (shaking head) Where do they get this stuff... 
INT. BACKSTAGE 
CAMERA FOLLOWS AMBER as she storms over to BACKSTAGE - RIGHT where Gladys watches Michelle ON STAGE. 
AMBER Mrs. Leeman? 
GLADYS (turning) Huh? 
AMBER I-I'm wearin' this costume.  I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight. 
GLADYS Oh really - I don't think so. (suddenly aware of camera) Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance.  And this... (pointing to costume) This is why we have the rule.  My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage.  We have kids in the audience. 
AMBER But, you - I mean... It's not my fault.  I-I... Please?  I didn't do anything wrong... 
Amber starts to cry. 
MICHELLE (climaxing) That's why... I must say... (raising arm upward) Soylent Green... is... people. 
BECKY (talking over music) I don't know how many of you know this, but I've got a very special fella in my life - that's right, I do... And if nobody minds, I'd like to sing a little song, just for him. 
SPOT FOLLOWS as Becky stands and walks center stage to what appears to be a COVERED MANNEQUIN.  TAPED INTRO TO "I Can't Take My Eyes Off You." 
BECKY (cont'd) You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off of you.  You'd be like Heaven to touch.  I wanna hold you so much.  At long last love has arrived and I thank God I'm alive. 
Becky removes the sheet, revealing a MANNEQUIN dressed like JESUS as he appeared on the cross: long hair, beard, crown of thorns, loincloth.  The ARMS ARE STUFFED so they move freely.  (Hands of stigmata.) 
BECKY (cont'd) You're just to good to be true.  Can't take my eyes off of you... 
Becky TALK-SINGS - a la William Shatner's "Rocket Man" - and DANCES around the Jesus mannequin doing the jitter- bug, the twist and a slow dance (his arms on her shoulders). 
DURING THE SLOW DANCE, THE LOIN CLOTH SLIPS AND BECKY MUST HOLD IT UP - GIVING THE APPEARANCE OF GRABBING HIS CROTCH. 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - BACKSTAGE 
Iris approaches Lisa who's given her outfit to Amber. 
IRIS C'mon, Lisa.  You're up next. 
LISA I quit.  And, uh, since my costume, y'know, was okay'd a month ago?  I'm givin' it to Amber. 
Amber breaks a smile. 
Taped music ENDS.  APPLAUSE.  Gladys, mic in hand, joins Becky for a big hug. 
GLADYS Boy, I'd hate to follow that.  Wow! 
Becky exits, pulling the wheeled Jesus behind her. 
GLADYS (cont'd) Voice of an angel, that one. 
Iris runs self-consciously out on stage, whispers in Gladys' ear, then runs back off stage. 
GLADYS (cont'd) ...Uh, I was just told that contestant number seven, Lisa Swenson, has quite the pageant. 
CROWD REACTS. 
GLADYS (cont'd) Well, these things happen.  At any rate, we still have one more contestant - number eight, Amber Atkins. 
Gladys exits.  A taped hip, hot DRUM BEAT starts. Suddenly, Amber glides into CENTER SPOT.  (Now wearing Lisa's costume, sleeves rolled up.)  Her feet burst into an amazing routine.  The loud drum beats seem to fly from her hands and feet as they punctuate the rhythm.  There's no glitz, just unbelievable skill.  It appears effortless as she floats around stage.  Like watching Michael Jackson moon walk for the first time, you can't take your eyes off her.  She concludes, center stage, with the GREATEST THIRTY SECONDS OF HER LIFE.  The audience goes WILD!  Amber takes bow after bow - they love her.  Gladys enters quickly, mic in hand. 
GLADYS (cont'd) Okay, okay, okay!  Well, now, it's finally time to say good-bye to our judges, so they can go make the toughest decision of their lives. 
PAN TO JUDGES.  They look nervous as hell.  A relaxed Hank sniffs from a paint soaked bag. 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASS ROOM - NIGHT 
Judges stare nervously at the camera - clip boards in front of them.  Hank's LOUD BREATHING from the paint soaked bag is obviously getting on John's nerves. 
DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.) So who get's the crown?  How are you going to figure this all out? 
JOHN Uh, we're gonna, y'know, compare scores and uh, figure out a-a winner. kCause we don't know the winner yet... I mean, I-I don't know who Jean and Harold picked.  No idea.  Did Gladys send you in here? 
HANK I know the winner!  I know the winner! I know the winner! 
JOHN No you don't!  Shut your goddamn mouth, you son-of-a-bitch!! 
Nerves shot, John suddenly LAUNCHES himself across the table at Hank. 
HAROLD Wait a second. 
JOHN You shut it!  You goddamn retard! 
Hank freezes, then starts to wail! 
HANK EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE! 
HAROLD Come on!  Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat! 
Hank stops crying and goes back to the bag. 
ANNETTE Shit. 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - STAGE 
The ELDERLY MAN/MAYOR, from earlier scene, enters and sings to a tape as Becky takes her victory walk. 
ELDERLY MAN/MAYOR (tune of "Miss America") "Here she is, Our Mount Rose American Teen Princess.  Look at her, doesn't she look fine.  Our hearts swell big, as we look at her.  Our Mount Rose American Teen Princess." 
EXT./INT. HIGH SCHOOL - LATER 
AMBULANCE pulls up.  Mary Johanson, unconscious, slumped in wheelchair, is brought out and put in.  Amber and Loretta wheel Annette out.  Paramedics put her in, too. 
ANNETTE We was robbed. 
LORETTA Okay.  Take her purse. 
AMBER Bye mom. 
ANNETTE We was robbed. 
AMBER It's okay. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER 
Amber faces camera as ambulance pulls away. 
AMBER Oh, Mom's okay.  They're just givin' her a ride back.  She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over. 
LORETTA Thank God for bunge cords. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER 
AMBER (tearing up) ...Yah-well, at least, y'know, I got to perform.  And Mom got to see me. (crying) I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer... 
Loretta puts her arm around Amber.  They walk off as Leslie and Pat approach. 
LESLIE Hey-hey, I'm Second Runner-up!  Whooo! I got second place! 
PAT Third. 
LESLIE Huh? 
Lisa passes by with her parents.  They look pissed. 
LISA No, it was worth it.  Amber shoulda won. 
LISA'S FATHER I'll tell ya one thing.  Peter never woulda pulled a shenanigan like that. 
LISA Well, y'know what, dad?  Y'know what? Peter's gay! 
She runs off.  Her parents stop DEAD IN THEIR TRACKS. 
LISA'S FATHER What?! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASS ROOM - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON BECKY'S FACE.  Flashes illuminate it.  With each photo she changes her smile and expression.  She loves this. 
PULL BACK to reveal two older men, with old-style news cameras, flash pictures. 
DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.) So, how does it feel to be the new Mount Rose American Teen Princess, Becky? 
OLDER MEN turn and look at camera, then take out a pen and note pad. 
BECKY Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know?  I mean, I won!  I'm the winner!  I'm going to State! 
Harold rushes off for the parade, joining other folks carrying baskets, lawn chairs and flags on the sidewalk. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
EXT. MOUNT ROSE STREET - BACK TO DOCUMENTARY CAMERA 
PAN OVER to see Gladys helping Becky climb on the swan, unaware of camera.  In b.g., DOCUMENTARY CREW interviews Amber and Leslie on their convertible behind the swan float. 
GLADYS C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it.  Now get up there.  Ride it side-saddle if you have to - like a horse.  C'mon, now. 
BECKY It smells funny.  Like gasoline. 
GLADYS Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico. 
BECKY My dress'll reek. 
GLADYS Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny.  Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth. 
EXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER 
Amber and Leslie, in gowns, look unhappy as they stare straight ahead, exhaust fumes - that appear to come from the swan's ass - cover them and their old convertible. 
LESLIE Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck? 
AMBER Yeah... 
LESLIE And the bite marks on my ears? 
AMBER (slowly turning) Yes... 
LESLIE I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs. 
AMBER Yes, Leslie! 
EXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER 
Hank rubs his head, then angrily gets out of the truck, SLAMMING THE DOOR ON ONE OF THE SUSPENDERS ON HIS OVERALLS.  He starts to walk, but can't, eventually leaning out from the truck - only moving his arms as if walking. 
EXT. MOUNT ROSE SIDE STREET - LATER 
Hank, still stuck in the door, is being teased by a GROUP OF KIDS who poke at him with flags and sticks.  ANOTHER LITTLE KID taunts him with his cotton candy - keeping it just out of his reach.  Hank bats at them like Frankenstein and the torch wielding townsfolk. 
EXT. MOUNT ROSE SIDE STREET - LATER 
Hank, still stuck in the door, holds the little kid by the back of the shirt in one hand and eats the kid's cotton candy with the other.  The kid struggles to get away.  A few BROKEN FLAGS are scattered on the ground. 
HANK Help...Hank!  Help...Hank! Help...Hank!  Help...Hank! 
ON SWAN FLOAT.  Gladys approaches. 
GLADYS Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan. 
IRIS Uh, Gladys? 
GLADYS What! 
IRIS We need more bars! 
GLADYS This is -- what? 
IRIS Enid ate a whole pan! 
GLADYS I swear to God she can't do anything by herself. 
EXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER 
AMBER (to camera) Oh-yah, this is exactly how I pictured it.  Chokin' on swan gas. 
Suddenly, like a gasoline soaked pinata, it EXPLODES! 
Gladys is thrown back.  Flames.  Screaming.  PANDEMONIUM! Becky doesn't have a chance.  She's a pink taffeta BALL OF FIRE.  The swan's back eventually collapses taking Becky into it's burning belly. 
MR. MELCHOIR Remember to count, ladies.  Cross on the left and arms up on eight!  On the beat!  On the beat!  Keep on it!  Keep movin' it!  C'mon, Miss Forest Lake, take that stick out of your ass or I will.  All right.  Very nice.  Now come on, arms out.  We're in the front row.  Come on, sell it!  That's very nice.  Remember, figure eights, ladies... 
INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA - MOMENTS LATER 
Colleen and Terry smoke and drink at a tall tiki table that's covered with empties.  In the b.g., a pageant worker passes out PINK BAGS to the contestants.  All the while, TWO FAT KIDS play "Marco Polo" in the pool. 
COLLEEN (tipsy, holding up glass) I can sum up our entire philosophy with this glass.  I look at it and say, "it's half full."  Which, in the beauty pageant biz means, "Where the hell's my waiter!" 
She laughs hard, then spins around in her chair. 
COLLEEN (cont'd) (screaming) Stop with the fuckin' Marco-Polo before I rip your fat little heads off! 
INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - STAGE AREA - AUDIENCE CHAIRS 
A very mature Miss Burnsville talks to Amber who is staring at Miss Burnsville's supernaturally well- supported chest. 
MR. MELCHOIR Miss Burnsville, you're up next... 
JUMP CUT TO: 
INT. STAGE AREA - AUDIENCE CHAIRS - MOMENTS LATER 
Amber sits addressing the camera.  Miss Burnsville is gone. 
AMBER Don't tell anyone, but, I have a little secret weapon of my own. 
Amber pulls out a jar of Vaseline from her purse and smiles innocently. 
INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA - SHELLFISH BUFFET - DAY 
Contestants hungrily fill their plates with seafood. 
INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA - SHELLFISH BUFFET 
Amber stands beside the buffet, holding only a salad. 
AMBER I don't eat shellfish.  Mom always says, "Don't ever eat nothin' that can carry its house around with it - who knows the last time it's been cleaned."  She should know. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA 
Amber eats at a tall tiki table with Miss Minneapolis. 
MISS MINNEAPOLIS ... I've done about thirty-five pageants.  I guess my most memorable one'd have to be Miss Teen America, 1995.  It was in Vegas.  My roommate did Adam West. 
SUPER: MR. WEST WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT 
MISS MINNEAPOLIS (cont'd) She said he was sooo horny. 
Amber stares at her with wide-eyed disbelief. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - STAGE AREA - DAY 
Amber watches four contestants in a row practice their talents.  All are equally amazing. "THEME from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY" starts.  Miss Minneapolis steps ON STAGE - silver unitard, silver streamers, silver tap shoes.  She starts a TAP ROUTINE that RIVALS AMBER'S. 
AMBER (whispering to camera) Oh my God.  Look at her, she's awesome.  I should just go home now. 
Terry and Colleen stand in front of the stage. 
TERRY Okay, okay, that's enough - I get it. 
SUDDENLY Miss Minneapolis FREEZES. 
MISS MINNEAPOLIS Oh - oh my God... (doubling over in pain) I gotta go! 
She runs off toward the RESTROOM. 
COLLEEN (calling after her) Well, you're gonna have to do somethin' with those nerves before Nationals.  Thirty-million people aren't gonna wait while you run to the john. 
FEMALE PRISONER Get your sweet ass off the bunk, Cinnamon. 
GLADYS (V.O. ON PHONE) Gotta go. 
Click.  DIAL TONE. 
EXT. LORETTA'S TRAILER - DAY 
Annette (left arm's been amputated and replaced with metal pincers which she hasn't mastered yet) sits at the picnic table with Amber and Loretta.  Throughout the following, Annette struggles to open a beer can which keeps flying out of her pincers.  (Handmade "congratulations" posters cover the lawn and trailer.) 
AMBER I just, I just can't believe it.  I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess! 
LORETTA Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama - look out! 
AMBER I'm gonna be on TV!  Just like Diane Sawyer. 
Annette opens a beer with a new HOOK replacing her hand. 
LORETTA Annette, just use your hand. 
ANNETTE They told me to practice. 
AMBER Okay, ready?  Here's the signal I'm gonna give Ma when I'm on TV. 
Amber MIMES inhaling a cigarette and Annette embraces her. 
ANNETTE My little Carol Burnett. 
EXT. AIR FIELD 
In the middle of a corn field.  The "runaway" is a gravel path cut between rows of corn.  A FOUR-SEATER plane is on the runway, in front of a group of town folk with hand- made "good luck" signs.  Amber (in Minnesota sash and tiara) and the Mayor stand beside the plane.  (NOTE: The plane never moves.) 
EXT. AIR FIELD - LATER 
MAYOR (into bullhorn) Here she is, Minnesota's American Teen Princess - soon to be the next America's American Teen Princess - our little Amber! 
ZOOM IN ON AMBER as PEOPLE cheer Amber on.

A giant Sarah Rose Cosmetics logo on the wall greets Amber. 
SUPER: SARAH ROSE COSMETICS NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS, LINCOLN, ALABAMA. 
The CONTESTANTS, including Amber, look around for the directory.  It reads: FOR LEASE.  A sign at the front of the building reads: SEIZED. 
SUPER: IN ITS FIFTIETH YEAR, SARAH ROSE COSMETICS WAS SEIZED BY THE IRS FOR TAX EVASION...

The contestants TEAR DOWN the Sarah Rose Logo.

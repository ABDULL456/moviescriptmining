BODY OF EVIDENCE 
B O D Y   O F   E V I D E N C E 
by Brad Mirman (second draft) 
Over the BLACK we hear the SOUNDS of two people making love.  A MAN'S VOICE MOANS passionately. 
FADE IN: 
INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT 
ANDREW MARSH lies on his back in bed.  He is a frail-looking man in his early sixties, with thinning gray hair.  On top of him is a much younger WOMAN.  Although her back is to us, we catch flashes of her face for a moment as she turns from side to side.  We see enough to know that this is a beautiful woman. 
She moves wildly, grinding her hips into him, her head arched back, her hands rubbing lightly over her breasts.  She reaches down, grabbing his hips and jerks them upwards, forcing him deeper inside her.  They move together -- faster -- and faster. 
The CAMERA slowly begins to PULL BACK.  As it does we see what we are watching is on a TELEVISION. 
Further back still.  We see TWO UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS standing before the television watching the act. 
The CAMERA begins to pan around the room.  Rain streaks down the windows of the room -- LIGHTNING flashes outside.  A VIDEO CAMERA is set up on a tripod.  More PLAIN CLOTHES POLICE, looking, dusting, talking. 
We continue to PAN.  We can now see it is the same room on the tape.  ON the bed lies the naked body of ANDREW MARSH, a sheet covering his lower torso.  His face is ashen, mouth open, his dull eyes looking out in a fixed stare.  The last instant of his life is etched upon a face frozen in pain. 
EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT 
LIGHTNING fills the night sky.  THUNDER BOOMS overhead.  The wind whips the RAIN furiously against anything in its path. The CAMERA moves slowly along rows of beautiful HOMES.  At the end is a cul-de-sac.  Several POLICE CARS are in the driveway, their RED LIGHTS FLASHING. 
A four-door SEDAN pulls into the driveway.  JOHN CARDENAS steps out into the rain.  He is a handsome Latin in his thirties, with hard, chiseled features and black, slicked-backed hair. He does not run through the rain -- he walks. 
DETECTIVE REESE, a man who looks more like an accountant than a homicide detective runs out to meet him. 
CARDENAS Is it Marsh? 
REESE Yeah. 
Just a hint of sadness shows on Cardenas' face.  It lasts an instant, then it's gone. 
REESE Sir, do you mind if we get out of the rain? 
Cardenas doesn't move.  He ignores the question. 
CARDENAS Who found him? 
REESE His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow. 
CARDENAS She was here? 
REESE No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers. 
CARDENAS Show me. 
Reese starts for the house.  Cardenas looks up into the night sky.  A FLASH of LIGHTNING fills the SCREEN. 
INT.  HOUSE, BEDROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA - NIGHT 
Pull back to reveal a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER snapping pictures of Marsh in bed. 
Cardenas enters followed by Reese.  He moves through the FORENSIC and MEDICAL TEAMS.  Anything Cardenas feels about the gruesome sight before him is hidden behind a mask of indifference. 
Standing by the bed is ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ROGER TROXELL, a short, baby-faced man.  Cardenas looks down at the body, then over at the MEDICAL EXAMINER, DR. HENRY McCURDY, a portly man with windblown cheeks and bloodshot eyes. 
CARDENAS How long? 
MCCURDY About three hours. 
CARDENAS Cause? 
MCCURDY Not sure.  I'll have everything you need tomorrow. 
CARDENAS Any prints on the nasal spray? 
REESE Marsh's and Rebecca Lawson's. 
TROXELL What if he did know what was in it? A lot of users put it in nasal spray bottles so they can use it in public. 
MCCURDY Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want. 
CARDENAS Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene? 
REESE A man across the street from Marsh saw her drive up about four thirty Sunday afternoon.  And her prints are all over the place. 
Cardenas stands and walks to a DART BOARD on the wall.  He gathers the DARTS, moves back and tosses one. 
TROXELL Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose? 
CARDENAS What did he say about Miss Lawson? 
TROXELL He can remember at least one occasion -- and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office. 
Cardenas throws another dart at the board. 
CARDENAS So she knew about his heart? 
TROXELL Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson. 
CARDENAS What about the will? 
TROXELL That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything. 
EXT.  CEMETERY - MORNING 
Gray clouds hang over head.  A light drizzle falls.  A GROUP of MOURNERS hold umbrellas as they stand around the grave. 
In the b.g. the PRESS is visible, held back my private SECURITY GUARDS. 
A WOMAN dressed in BLACK stands in the front of the MOUNERS, her face hidden behind a hat and veil.  RAYMOND SATTLER, a tall, distinguished-looking man in his sixties stands beside her.  He supports his weight with the aid of a CANE.  The service concludes.  Sattler along with several other PEOPLE offer her their condolences.  Joanne Braslow is there.  She does not go over to Rebecca. 
CARDENAS AND REESE stand off to the side by a large oak tree. Cardenas watches and waits.  He steps forward as Sattler leads the woman by. 
CARDENAS Miss Lawson? 
The Woman stops.  Her back is to Cardenas. 
CARDENAS I'm District Attorney, John Cardenas. 
REBECCA LAWSON removes her hat and veil and slowly turns around.  She is in her late twenties.  A deep pain fills her face -- controlled, but evident.  Her eyes are tired -- heavy from crying -- but no tears show now.  This is a woman whose grief is private and not displayed for others.  Although emotionally drained she is still stunningly beautiful.  So beautiful that even Cardenas' usually cool demeanor cannot hide how impressed he is. 
SATTLER I don't think that this is the time, or the place. 
CARDENAS I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry. 
SATTLER An inquiry into what? 
CARDENAS For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death? 
SATTLER Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime. 
CARDENAS Did I say it was a natural death? 
Cardenas and Rebecca lock eyes.  Rebecca stares at him genuinely shocked by his accusation.  Cardenas nods and walks away.  In the b.g. we see Joanne staring at Rebecca with hostility. 
INT.  HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Large and homey.  A fire roars in the fireplace.  FRANK DULANEY sits on his couch as he goes over some PAPERWORK.  He is mid- thirties, powerful, self-assured. 
SHARON DULANEY enters.  She is an attractive woman in her early thirties.  She kisses him on the cheek then pushes his PAPERWORK aside and sits down on his lap. 
SHARON You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing. 
SATTLER I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files. 
DULANEY Why? 
SATTLER Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have. 
DULANEY Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have. 
SATTLER (jokingly) Well, I guess that makes you the best. (candidly) Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit three million dollars.  As executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us.  All I'm asking you to do is talk to her. 
Dulaney thinks about it for a moment. 
DULANEY Alright, I'll talk to her 
SATTLER She's waiting in the conference room. 
Dulaney stands and walks towards the door. 
SATTLER (continuing) You know, I knew Andrew Marsh for almost twenty years -- or thought I did.  What do you think would make a man in his condition do the things he did? 
Dulaney stops at the door and looks back. 
DULANEY I think the question is:  What is it about her that made him want to do it? 
INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Rebecca is seated at the end of the conference table smoking a CIGARETTE.  Sunlight flows through a window and highlights her hair.  She is dressed in a fashionable business suit that clings to every curve of her body. 
Dulaney enters the room.  When he sees her he can't help but stare.  Rebecca notes his gaze. 
DULANEY Miss Lawson, I'm Frank Dulaney. 
She raises the cigarette to her lips.  Dulaney notices despite her outward composure her hand is shaking. 
REBECCA (nervously) Are you going to represent me? 
DULANEY There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur. (beat) Did you kill him? 
Rebecca appears hurt by the question. 
REBECCA You don't waste any time, do you? 
Dulaney doesn't answer.  He studies her -- his eyes probing hers. 
REBECCA (continuing) Do you think I did it? 
DULANEY I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you. 
REBECCA You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint? 
DULANEY Not a very good one I'm afraid. 
REBECCA And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney. 
DULANEY You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges. 
Rebecca's anxiety begins to surface.  She feigns a weak smile. 
REBECCA He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others. 
DULANEY You still haven't answered my question. 
She takes a long drag of her cigarette before answering.  She looks at Dulaney.  Displaying emotions is not something that comes easily.  Tears well up in her eyes. 
REBECCA (emotionally) I loved him.  A big part of my life has been torn away from me, Mr. Dulaney.  A part I can never get back -- and on top of that people are saying that I am somehow responsible for it.  They've taken everything that is good and caring about two people in love and made it dirty. 
A single tear streams down her check.  She knows what he wants to hear her say -- and she resents having to say it. 
REBECCA No -- I didn't kill him. 
REESE What time did you leave? 
REBECCA Six thirty -- and he was very much alive. 
CARDENAS Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine? 
REBECCA I have. 
CARDENAS Did you use it the night Marsh died? 
REBECCA No.  I haven't done it in years. 
REESE Did Marsh use it? 
REBECCA No -- never. 
REESE It had to get there somehow. 
REBECCA It didn't get there from me. 
CARDENAS Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition? 
REBECCA No. 
CARDENAS Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions. 
REBECCA That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious. 
REESE He never mentioned his heart disease? 
DULANEY She just said that. 
REESE Why do you think he lied to you? 
DULANEY That's something only Marsh would know. 
REESE I think Miss Lawson knew it too.  I think she slipped him the coke and he popped his cork giving her the high- hard-one. 
Dulaney's anger shows.  He stands. 
DULANEY That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you. 
CARDENAS Sit down, Frank. 
DULANEY No.  Miss Lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions. She doesn't have to sit here and be insulted.  So, either you charge her now or we're leaving. 
A beat.  Dulaney and Cardenas lock eyes.  Cardenas shrugs his shoulders. 
CARDENAS Fine. 
Dulaney motions for Rebecca to get up.  She stands and they walk to the door.  Reese looks at Cardenas.  Cardenas nods. 
REESE Rebecca Lawson, you're under arrest for the murder of Andrew Marsh. 
Rebecca is stunned -- frightened.  She looks at Dulaney in disbelief.  Dulaney looks at Cardenas angrily.  Reese removes his handcuffs as he moves towards Rebecca. 
REESE You have the right to remain silent. If you give up-- 
CARDENAS (to Reese) I don't think the handcuffs will be necessary.  You can finish giving Miss Lawson her rights outside. 
Reese grabs Rebecca by the arm and leads her to the door.  She looks back at Frank, her face filled with fear -- her eyes welling with tears. 
REBECCA (frightened) Frank! 
DULANEY I'll have you out in a few hours. 
Reese ushers her through the door.  A beat.  Dulaney and Cardenas are left alone.  Cardenas starts fishing through a can of NUTS, carefully extracting the cashews.  Dulaney continues to stand. 
DULANEY Lookin' to make the papers, John? 
REBECCA Something like that. 
DULANEY We're not animals. 
As Rebecca speaks, Dulaney seems captivated. 
REBECCA Of course we are.  Our primal urges are still there -- but we've taken sex and intellectualized it, refined it down to its most essential components.  It's bland, easy, mechanical.  There's great passion in the struggle -- such craving in denial.  Do you know what it's like to yearn for something?  I'm not talking about wanting, or needing. I'm talking about an urge so deep that your skin burns and every cell in your body pulses with desire? 
Dulaney appears moved by the passion of her words -- but he's uncomfortable by it and quickly pushes it aside. 
DULANEY (awkwardly) I think we're getting a little off the subject here. 
REBECCA I thought the subject was sex? 
DULANEY As it pertains to you -- not me. (beat) Did you always know you had different... tastes? 
REBECCA Yes. 
DULANEY How? 
REBECCA I don't know if it's something I can explain to you. 
DULANEY Why not? 
REBECCA Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined. 
DULANEY Try. 
Rebecca thinks for a moment. 
REBECCA When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down. 
DULANEY If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard? 
REBECCA Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it. 
Dulaney appears lost in her words.  This isn't lost on Rebecca. She walks off.  Dulaney stares after her intrigued. 
INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - EVENING 
A light rain falls outside.  Dulaney picks at his food.  He stares out the window.  He seems oblivious to the conversation between Sharon and Michael. 
MICHAEL Albert's got the stomach flu. 
SHARON That's too bad. 
MICHAEL No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch. 
SHARON Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well. 
MICHAEL Not even if they're a dork? 
SHARON Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling. 
MICHAEL No way.  Jerry Milner stopped by and Albert puked right in front of him. 
Sharon tries to suppress a grin. 
SHARON Don't use language like that at the dinner table. 
MICHAEL Sorry. 
Sharon looks at Dulaney.  He is still staring out the window, deep in thought. 
INT.  DEN - EVENING 
Dulaney is at his desk, looking at PHOTOGRAPHS of Marsh and the bedroom.  Sharon enters. 
SHARON Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him. 
INT.  RESTAURANT - DAY 
Dimly lit.  Dark wood and leather.  Dulaney sits at a table with Rebecca.  She removes a CIGARETTE and holds it, waiting for Dulaney to light it.  Dulaney fumbles through his pockets and removes a book of MATCHES.  He lights one.  Rebecca doesn't lean forward to meet him.  He must go to her.  She looks into his eyes as she cups her hand over his.  A beat.  She lights the cigarette and takes a drag, then arches her neck back and blows a stream of smoke towards the ceiling.  SHE DOES NOT BLOW OUT THE MATCH OR REMOVE HER HAND FROM DULANEY'S.  She watches him as it burns down towards his fingers.  After a long moment she leans in and sensually blows out the match and releases his hand. 
DULANEY How'd you meet Marsh? 
REBECCA I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless. 
A FOURSOME a few tables away are staring at her.  Rebecca sees them. 
DULANEY -- And then? 
REBECCA We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left. 
DULANEY Why didn't you live together? 
REBECCA Andrew was worried about how it would look. 
A COUPLE in a booth are looking at Rebecca and whispering. Rebecca and Dulaney notice them. 
REBECCA Can we get out of here? 
DULANEY Sure.  Where to? 
Rebecca stands up.  She doesn't answer.  She just walks off. 
EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 
Dulaney pulls up in his car behind Rebecca's.  They get out. Dulaney follows her as she walks to the door. 
DULANEY This is your house. 
REBECCA (walking towards the door) I know. 
Dulaney stops. 
DULANEY I don't think this is a good idea. 
Rebecca stops and turns towards him. 
REBECCA Why not? 
DULANEY Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house. 
REBECCA Is it against the law? 
DULANEY No -- it just doesn't look right. 
Rebecca stares at him for a moment, then looks down the street to her left and back to her right, then back at Dulaney. 
REBECCA No one's looking. 
She walks to her front door and opens it.  She enters, leaving the door open.  Dulaney waits for a moment, then follows. 
INT.  REBECCA'S, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 
Dulaney enters.  Rebecca is standing in the middle of the room. Her back is to Dulaney, but she knows he is there.  Dulaney looks around the room.  He stares at a group of PHOTOGRAPHS on the wall.  On the other WALL is a GIANT TELEVISION SCREEN. 
DULANEY'S POV - OF THE WALL 
filled with EROTIC PAINTINGS AND PHOTOGRAPHS -- sensual but not vulgar. 
Rebecca walks over and stands very close to him as he studies the artwork. 
REBECCA What do you think? 
DULANEY I think the photographer's probably a voyeur. 
REBECCA I'm the photographer. 
Sattler walks over with another MAN.  He ignores Biggs. 
SATTLER Frank -- this is Harvey Willows from the L.A. Times.  He'd like to ask you a few questions. 
MAN It's an incredible story going on here. (as if quoting a headline) Woman accused of using sex to kill lover. 
BIGGS I'll say -- it's gonna give a whole new meaning to the state nickname. 
Biggs LAUGHS and walks off.  Sattler glares at him.  Dulaney smirks. 
MAN (confused) What's the state nickname? 
DULANEY (dryly) The Beaver State. 
EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY 
Rows of new Town Houses line the street.  Dulaney drives up and walks towards the front door of one of them.  He KNOCKS. JOANNE BRASLOW answers.  She stares at Dulaney innocently. 
INT.  JOANNE'S TOWN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Sparsely decorated.  Very trendy.  High tech furniture and designer lights.  Joanne sits on the couch -- Dulaney on one of the chairs.  There is COFFEE on the table. 
JOANNE I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along. 
DULANEY What changed? 
JOANNE He did.  Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough  -- and well... 
Joanne stops as emotion fills her.  Her eyes well with tears. 
DULANEY You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you? 
JOANNE I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca. 
DULANEY I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much? 
JOANNE I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it. 
DULANEY If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder? 
JOANNE Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had. 
DULANEY How do you know what kind of sex they had? 
JOANNE I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place. 
DULANEY Did Mr. Marsh use drugs? 
JOANNE No. 
DULANEY What about Miss Lawson? 
JOANNE Yes -- cocaine. 
Dulaney is shocked by this. 
DULANEY How do you know that? 
JOANNE I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial. 
Dulaney looks like he's been kicked in the stomach. 
JOANNE Is something wrong. 
A beat.  Dulaney looks at her slowly. DULANEY What?  No -- nothing.  Thank you for your time. 
He gets up and walks to the door.  Joanne stands and stares after him with a trace of a grin. 
INT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - DAY 
JUDGE BURNHAM, a confident BLACK MAN in his fifties sits behind the bench.  He is strong-willed -- tough but fair.  There is a rough edge to him from his childhood on the streets. 
JUDGE BURNHAM This trial by its very nature is explosive.  The press is going to have a field day and I will not tolerate any activity in my courtroom that will fuel it. (to Dulaney and Cardenas) Both of you are going to be delving into very personal aspects of peoples lives.  I warn you now.  When you do so -- if you cannot establish a clear line of relevancy early on in your examinations I will stop you.  Is that clear? 
Dulaney and Cardenas both nod. 
JUDGE BURNHAM Mr. Cardenas. 
Cardenas stands and walks towards the JURY. 
CARDENAS (points to Rebecca) You all can see the defendant, Rebecca Lawson.  But as this trial proceeds you will see that she is not only the defendant -- she is the murder weapon itself. 
(stops and thinks for a moment) Is that possible?  Can a person actually be a weapon?  The answer is yes.  If I hit you and you die -- I am the cause of your death.  But can sex be called a weapon?  Yes.  And what a deadly weapon Rebecca Lawson made of it.  The State will prove that Miss Lawson seduced Andrew Marsh -- that she put increasing sexual demands on him while she secretly administered cocaine.  All the while knowing that he had a severe heart condition. (beat) She is a beautiful woman -- but when this trial is over you will see her no differently than a gun, or a knife or any other instrument used as a weapon.  She is a killer.  And the worst kind -- one who disguised herself as a loving partner. 
Cardenas walks back to the prosecution table and sits down. 
JUDGE BURNHAM Mr. Dulaney? 
Dulaney stands up and approaches the jury. 
DULANEY I know what you're thinking -- and it's a mistake.  You look at Miss Lawson and you see a beautiful woman who was involved with an older man -- and you think she looks like the type.  She could've done it.  And that's exactly what the District Attorney wants you to think.  Yes, she is beautiful.  So what?  Does that make her a killer?  Of course not.  This case is not about appearances.  It's about facts. (beat) As Mr. Cardenas presents his case you will see that there are very few facts -- that the bulk of the States evidence is circumstantial.  I'm confident that by the conclusion of this trial you will not just have a reasonable doubt.  You will have no doubt at all --  that Rebecca Lawson is innocent of the charges against her. 
INT.  COURTROOM - LATER - DAY 
McCurdy is on the witness stand.  Cardenas stands before him. 
CARDENAS Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death? 
MCCURDY A massive cardiac arrest. 
CARDENAS What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death? 
MCCURDY Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease. 
CARDENAS Was the heart attack the result of natural causes? 
MCCURDY No. 
CARDENAS What induced it? 
MCCURDY We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood. 
CARDENAS So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine? 
MCCURDY I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage. 
CARDENAS Then how did it get into his body? 
MCCURDY We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine. 
Cardenas holds up a bottle of NASAL SPRAY in a PLASTIC BAG.  He brings it over to McCurdy. 
CARDENAS Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand? 
MCCURDY (examines it) Yes. 
CARDENAS Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A. (to McCurdy) Were any fingerprints found on the bottle? 
MCCURDY Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's. 
CARDENAS Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition? 
MCCURDY Increase his heart rate. 
CARDENAS -- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine? 
MCCURDY It would be an added stress to his heart. 
CARDENAS What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love? 
JOANNE Yes. 
CARDENAS Tell the court about that, please. 
JOANNE I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial. 
CARDENAS Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death? 
JOANNE Yes. 
CARDENAS How did he look? 
JOANNE Horrible.  He was tired and pale. 
CARDENAS Did you talk about Miss Lawson? 
JOANNE Yes. 
CARDENAS What did Mr. Marsh say? 
JOANNE He was worried.  He said that she was acting stranger and stranger.  He said that if this kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it. 
There is an audible BUZZ from the crowd.  For the first time Rebecca's confident exterior seems to fade and is replaced with genuine concern. 
CARDENAS Thank you. (to Dulaney) Your witness. 
Cardenas sits down.  Dulaney gets up slowly and walks towards Joanne. 
DULANEY How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom? 
JOANNE What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial? 
DULANEY Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom? 
JOANNE Yes-- (thinks a moment) It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth. 
DULANEY Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death? 
JOANNE He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it. 
DULANEY Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile? 
JOANNE Yes -- he mentioned it. 
DULANEY So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress. 
JOANNE I suppose. 
DULANEY So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it. 
THE JURY waits anxiously for her answer. 
Joanne fidgets in his chair as she thinks.  She appears confused. 
JOANNE I don't know.  I'm not sure. 
DULANEY Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible? 
JOANNE (begrudgingly) Yes.  I suppose it's possible. 
Cardenas leans back in his seat frustrated.  Rebecca breathes a sigh of relief. 
INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON 
Quiet and desolate -- most of the city employees have left for the day.  Dulaney walks towards the back of the lot with Rebecca. 
REBECCA You were brilliant today. 
DULANEY It's only the beginning. 
CARDENAS Did you ever see her again after that? 
DR. PALEY Yes -- several times. 
CARDENAS What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson? 
DR. PALEY We stopped seeing each other. 
CARDENAS Why? 
DR. PALEY Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me. 
CARDENAS What kind of information? 
DR. PALEY She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart. 
WHISPERS from the crowd fill the room. 
CARDENAS Did you suggest any? 
DR. PALEY Yes -- Insulin and others. 
CARDENAS What did she say? 
DR. PALEY She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high. 
CARDENAS -- And what did you suggest? 
DR. PALEY Cocaine. 
More GASPS from the crowd.  Rebecca's remains calm, but her eyes glare at Paley hatefully. 
CARDENAS (to Dulaney) Your witness. 
Cardenas sits down.  Dulaney approaches Paley with a smile. 
DULANEY Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson? 
DR. PALEY We had dinner at a restaurant. 
DULANEY Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot? 
DR. PALEY No. 
DULANEY You didn't grab her and try to kiss her? 
DR. PALEY No. 
DULANEY If necessary I can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence. 
Paley thinks for a moment.  He is nervous. 
DR. PALEY Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument. 
DULANEY And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not. 
DR. PALEY (hesitantly) Yes. 
DULANEY And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson? 
DR. PALEY No. 
Dulaney walks back to his desk and removes a TAPE PLAYER from a cardboard box. 
DULANEY Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now. 
CARDENAS Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made. 
Dulaney takes out two pieces of PAPER and approaches the bench. 
DULANEY (pleading) Rebecca -- please.  No more. 
Rebecca stares at him warmly -- fondly. 
REBECCA I told you in the beginning that it was my way.  My way can be many things -- pleasure or pain. 
She lifts a bottle of white vinegar and holds it over his burn. He tenses as she pours it on his chest.  -- then relaxes when he realizes it's water.  He breathes a SIGH of relief. 
REBECCA You see how life is, Frank?  We judge things.  We look at things from the outside and assume we know what's on the inside. 
She takes a sip from the bottle. 
REBECCA Water.  But you assumed it was vinegar -- because you were only looking at the outside. 
Her meaning isn't lost on Dulaney.  She watches him -- as if studying him -- then slowly -- very slowly,  she pulls on the belt of her ROBE.  The robe parts revealing the beauty of her body.  She gently lowers herself on top of him -- pressing her breasts against him.  Dulaney's breathing quickens in excitement.  Rebecca moves her head to his chest -- kissing his burns softly while her fingers caress lightly over his stomach. She gradually moves her head down -- lower -- and lower. 
CLOSE ON DULANEY 
he stares at the ceiling -- his mind a maze of confusion.  Soon the power of her touch fills him -- overpowering him.  His eyes close.  The pain that only moments ago filled his body is replaced with pleasure. 
INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
It's late.  Dulaney enters quietly and heads for the stairs.  A LIGHT comes on.  Sharon is sitting on the couch waiting. 
SHARON Late night? 
Her voice startles Dulaney. 
DULANEY Yeah -- what are you doing up? 
SHARON We have to talk. 
DULANEY What's wrong? 
SHARON That's what I was hoping you'd tell me. 
Dulaney enters the living room. 
DULANEY Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point? 
SHARON Where have you been? 
DULANEY Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements. 
SHARON Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you. (beat) You were with her, weren't you? 
DULANEY Yes. 
SHARON Why did you lie to me? 
DULANEY Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking. 
Sharon springs off the couch. 
SHARON This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to turn this around on me. 
DULANEY I'm not. 
SHARON You're sleeping with her, aren't you? 
DULANEY No. 
SHARON It's bad enough that you are.  It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me. 
She starts to walks out of the room.  Dulaney grabs her by the arm. 
DULANEY Sharon... 
She swings around and slaps him across the face, then stares at him angrily, her eyes filled with tears. 
CARDENAS Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened. 
DULANEY (to Cardenas) I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else. 
CARDENAS Your Honor -- please! 
JUDGE BURNHAM I'll see both of you in my chambers. Right now. 
INT.  JUDGE BURNHAM'S CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER 
Judge Burnham lights a cigarette and sits on the edge of his desk.  Dulaney and Cardenas stand before him. 
JUDGE BURNHAM Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you? 
DULANEY No, Your Honor. 
JUDGE BURNHAM Maybe you don't know what it's like where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but I do.  I came from a neighborhood just like hers.  This is a whole other world for her.  She's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people.  So, she puts on her best dress, fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible. (beat) Being poor and having pride is not a crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you attempt to impeach another witness' testimony in my courtroom -- your foundations better be based on something other than semantics. 
EXT.  COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON 
Dulaney walks down the steps.  Cardenas joins him. 
CARDENAS I'm surprised you can walk after the way Burnham chewed your ass out this afternoon. 
Cardenas grins.  His comment was meant as a friendly jab between old friends.  Dulaney doesn't see it that way. 
DULANEY (coldly) I've got work to do. 
CARDENAS Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds. 
DULANEY I didn't hear it. 
CARDENAS What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you. 
DULANEY Back off, John. 
Cardenas studies him for a moment. 
CARDENAS You're sleeping with her, aren't you? 
Dulaney forces a laugh.  It's not a very convincing one. 
DULANEY That's ridiculous. 
CARDENAS I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over. 
DULANEY You don't know what you're talking about. 
CARDENAS Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning? 
DULANEY You've been following me? 
CARDENAS Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm building a case against her, remember? 
Something in Dulaney snaps.  He grabs Cardenas and pushes him up against the wall.  Cardenas pushes back. 
CARDENAS If your head wasn't up your ass you would have thought of it too.  You're losing perspective.  Get out while you can -- before she takes you down with her. 
INT.  HALLWAY - AFTERNOON 
Dulaney walks towards his office.  Biggs walks quickly down the hall and joins him. 
BIGGS I've been waiting for you to get back. 
DULANEY You got something on the coke? 
BIGGS No -- but I got something. 
Biggs steps into Dulaney's office.  Dulaney follows. 
JUDGE BURNHAM Due to the sensitive nature of this witness' testimony and the inability of the spectators to allow him to complete it, I am clearing the courtroom. 
Sounds of protest fill the room as the BAILIFFS start to usher out the crowd. 
INT.  COURTROOM LATER 
The gallery is empty.  Only Dulaney, Rebecca, Cardenas, Troxell, Roston, Judge Burnham, The Jury and Court Officials remain. 
CARDENAS What did she do next, Mr. Roston? 
ROSTON She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her. (beat) At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die. 
CARDENAS If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it? 
ROSTON I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had. 
CARDENAS What happened after that? 
ROSTON I woke up the next morning and she was gone. 
CARDENAS Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson? 
ROSTON Yes. 
CARDENAS Who was your primary beneficiary? 
ROSTON She was. 
CARDENAS Thank you.  The State rests. 
JUDGE BURNHAM Mister Dulaney? 
Dulaney is stunned -- deep in thought.  He doesn't appear to hear the question. 
JUDGE BURNHAM Mister Dulaney? 
Dulaney looks at the jury.  What he sees isn't good.  He thinks for a moment.  He leans over and quickly speaks with Rebecca. We cannot hear them -- but their conversation is heated. Rebecca says something.  Dulaney looks at Roston.  A beat. Dulaney stands. 
DULANEY Mr. Roston, you said it was the best sex you ever had.  Is that the best sex with a woman, or a man? 
Cardenas bolts from his seat. 
CARDENAS Objection! 
DULANEY I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual? 
CARDENAS Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial. 
DULANEY Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was. 
Judge Burnham thinks for a moment. 
JUDGE BURNHAM The witness will answer the question. 
DULANEY Mr. Roston? 
ROSTON Yes. 
DULANEY And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson? 
ROSTON Yes. 
DULANEY And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover? 
ROSTON Yes. 
DULANEY And she left shortly after that? 
A pause.  Roston thinks, struggling to make a decision. 
MISS SELLERS There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired. 
INT.  DULANEY'S OFFICE - DUSK 
Dulaney is at his desk.  Biggs enters excited. 
BIGGS Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting.  I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler. 
DULANEY Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive. 
BIGGS What would Joanne Braslow need with an estate attorney?  She wasn't even mentioned in Marsh's will. 
Dulaney thinks for a moment.  He grins as an idea enters his mind. 
DULANEY Not this will. 
INT.  FILE ROOM - EVENING 
Dulaney and Biggs sit at a table going through a stack of papers.  Dulaney traces his finger along a piece of paper. 
DULANEY Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 
BIGGS What good does that do -- it's the old will? 
DULANEY Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated. 
BIGGS She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick. 
INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - EVENING 
Dulaney is washing up for dinner.  He speaks to Sharon who is in the bedroom. 
DULANEY I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend. 
SHARON Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael. 
Sharon leaves the room.  Dulaney reaches for his TOOTHBRUSH -- picks up a TUBE of TOOTH PASTE.  It is empty.  He stares at the EMPTY TUBE. 
DULANEY (to himself) Drug store. 
INT.  COURTROOM - MORNING 
Dulaney looks worn, tired -- the tension between him and Rebecca shows. 
JUDGE BURNHAM Mr. Dulaney, are you ready to call your next witness? 
Dulaney doesn't seem to hear him. 
JUDGE BURNHAM Mr. Dulaney, are you with us? 
Dulaney snaps out of it. 
DULANEY Yes, Your Honor.  The defense recalls Joanne Braslow. 
As Joanne walks towards the stand Dulaney looks over at Rebecca.  It's as if he is trying to make up his mind about her.  Joanne takes her seat. 
JUDGE BURNHAM Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath. 
DULANEY How often do you use cocaine? 
Cardenas shoots out of his seat. 
CARDENAS Objection, Your Honor. 
JUDGE BURNHAM (impatiently) Counsel approach the bench. 
Dulaney and Cardenas walk over to the bench. 
JUDGE BURNHAM Mr. Dulaney, I'm getting tired of seeing you this close to me. 
DULANEY Would you read for us the time of the purchase? 
JOANNE Three fifteen. 
DULANEY A.M -- or P.M.? 
JOANNE P.M. 
DULANEY You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there? 
JOANNE I don't know. 
DULANEY Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought? 
JOANNE (nervously) No. 
DULANEY Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle? 
JOANNE No!  Why would I want to kill him? 
DULANEY Because you were jealous.  Because he cut you out of the will.  Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored. 
SILENCE fills the room.  Members of the JURY look at Rebecca, they are confused -- doubt fills their minds. 
DULANEY The defense rests. 
INT.  DULANEY'S DEN - EVENING 
Dark.  Dulaney is standing by the window, watching the RAIN FALL outside.  Sharon enters. 
SHARON We can't go on like this, Frank. 
Dulaney continues to stare out the window. 
DULANEY I know. 
SHARON Talk to me. 
He shakes his NO. 
SHARON Please -- this is ripping us apart. 
DULANEY (emotionally) I can't talk about it now. 
She senses his pain and moves to him, wrapping her arms around his shoulders. 
SHARON Don't shut me out.  Let me in. 
He turns and faces her.  She can see the pain on his face. 
DULANEY You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore.  I don't know me anymore. 
SHARON We can't pretend this isn't happening. 
DULANEY Please -- not now. 
SHARON Why didn't you come to me? 
DULANEY I don't know. 
SHARON You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me. 
DULANEY It's more involved than that. 
SHARON It was a place to start. 
DULANEY You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you? 
SHARON I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are. 
Dulaney sits beside Rebecca.  In the row behind them is Sattler and Biggs. 
The JURY enters.  Their faces betray nothing.  One by one they file into their seats. 
Cardenas sits with Troxell -- both of them watching anxiously. 
JUDGE BURNHAM Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? 
The JURY FOREMAN stands. 
JURY FOREMAN We have, Your Honor. 
The BAILIFF walks over and takes the VERDICT SLIP from the FOREMAN, then walks over to Judge Burnham and hands it to him. Judge Burnham reads the decision.  He hands it back to the Bailiff who takes it to the COURT CLERK. 
ON REBECCA 
She waits nervously for the Court Clerk to read the verdict. 
ON CARDENAS 
he taps his pen against the desk anxiously. 
ON THE COURT CLERK 
He opens the verdict slip and looks at it.  He stands slowly. 
COURT CLERK The jury finds the defendant -- not guilty. 
Relief floods Rebecca's face.  Dulaney shows no emotion. Sattler and Biggs shakes hands, then lean forward to congratulate Dulaney. 
Rebecca turns to Dulaney to hug him -- before she can, Dulaney has picked up his briefcase and is leaving the courtroom. 
INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON 
Dulaney walks towards his car with Biggs.  There is no sense of victory or elation. 
BIGGS What are you gonna do now? 
DULANEY Take some time off. 
BIGGS You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne? 
DULANEY I don't know. 
Dulaney reaches his car. 
DULANEY You did a good job, Charlie. 
BIGGS Thanks, Mister D. 
Biggs walks away.  Dulaney takes out his keys, opens the door to his car.  He is about to get in when he senses someone behind him.  He turns around. 
Joanne steps out from behind a pillar.  She stares at Dulaney hatefully.  Her hand is inside her purse. 
JOANNE That bastard should have left me something.  I worked for him for six years -- and he goes and gives it all to her. 
Dulaney looks around the parking lot.  He is alone.  Joanne is obviously very high on something.  Her mind seems to wander, her eyes drift. 
JOANNE You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off. 
DULANEY Then you would have gotten your money? 
JOANNE Yes. 
DULANEY You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne? 
JOANNE Do you think if I did I'd be stupid enough to tell you? 
Dulaney looks her hand fidgeting in her purse. 
Two CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES are on the floor by the couch.  Dulaney looks on the coffee table. 
HIS POV - COFFEE TABLE 
A VIAL is open and on its side.  A RAZOR BLADE and STRAW lay next to it.  A pile of WHITE POWDER has been dumped out. Several lines of cocaine have been drawn. 
Dulaney starts to move towards the living room.  He is almost at the door when the BIG SCREEN TELEVISION TURNS ON.  We see the tape of Dulaney and Rebecca making love. 
REBECCA (OS) Is this what you're looking for, Frank? 
Dulaney turns around to find Rebecca standing behind him, a remote control in her hand. 
DULANEY (distant) You killed him.  You killed him -- and I got you off. 
REBECCA That's crazy. 
DULANEY Is it?  Joanne Braslow was perfect, wasn't she?  You knew we'd see her on the tape and find out about her coke problem.  After that, the digging should have been easy -- but we missed the will.  You knew we were following her, so you called Koehler and had him contact her.  That put us right back on track.  All we needed then was to prove that she had an opportunity.  The drug store took care of that.  She dropped off the stuff and you came back and killed him.  Didn't you? 
She shrugs her shoulders.  His frustration clearly amuses her. She grins slightly, almost taunting him. 
DULANEY I want the tape. 
Dulaney starts into the living room. 
REBECCA I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy. 
DULANEY That wasn't the deal. 
REBECCA (provoking him) So, sue me. (as cold as ice) Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again. 
DULANEY (growing angrier) I'm not leaving without that tape. 
REBECCA Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite. 
Dulaney loses control. 
DULANEY You fuckin' bitch! 
He grabs her by the shoulders and pushes her into the wall. Rebecca struggles, but it is little use -- he is a man consumed with rage.  Dulaney continues to smash her into the wall. 
Rebecca reaches onto the desk -- lifts up a FOUNTAIN PEN and stabs it into Dulaney's shoulder at the base of his neck. Dulaney SCREAMS and lets go.  Rebecca starts to runs into the living room.  Dulaney follows. 
INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Dulaney catches Rebecca -- grabs her -- spins her around -- then backhands her across the face, knocking her to the ground. In the b.g. the VIDEO of them in bed plays on the screen. Dulaney sits on top of her and grabs her by the hair.  He repeatedly smashes her head onto the floor. 
MAN'S VOICE Let her go! 
Dulaney stops.  He looks behind him. 
HIS POV 
Standing in the bedroom doorway is Dr. Paley.  He is holding a GUN at Dulaney. 
Dulaney stares at him with disbelief as he staggers to his feet, his hand holding the wound on his shoulder.  A short, breathless LAUGH drifts out of Dulaney as he starts to put it all together.  Rebecca stands up, holding her head as she tries to catch her breath. 
DR. PALEY (to Rebecca) Are you alright? 
Rebecca NODS.  Her face hardens. 
REBECCA You've got to kill him, Alan. 
DR. PALEY What? 
DULANEY She's right, Paley.  You've got to kill me.  She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're an accessory to murder. 
REBECCA Shoot him. 
Paley struggles to make a decision.  The gun shakes in his hand.  Suddenly, the whole scheme becomes clear to Dulaney.

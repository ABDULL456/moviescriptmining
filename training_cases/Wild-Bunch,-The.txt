FADE IN: 
OUTSKIRTS OF A SOUTH TEXAS RAILROAD YARD (SAN RAFAEL) 
A TRAIN ROARS PAST REVEALING IN THE DISTANCE FIVE MET RIDING TOWARD CAMERA along the tracks. In CLOSE F.G. is.the back part of a sign. 
NARRATOR To most of America in 1913, the Age of Innocence had arrived and the stories of the Indian Wars and the Gold.RuSh and the Great Gunfighters had become either barroom ballyhoo or front-porch remiraiscences... .But on both sides of the $io Grande men still lived as thia7 had in the 1 70's and 1 80's -- unchanged. men in a changing land. THEY WEAR THE KHAKI UNIFORMS OF THE UNITED STATES CnVALJRY.. The horses bear the government brand and the saddles are regulation. PIKE BISHOP,. wearing lieutenant's bars, rides slightly ahead of the others. He rides stiffly; always slightly in pain... Pike is a not unhandsome, leather-faced man in his early forties. A thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant for violence who is afraid of nothing - except the. changes in himself and those around him. Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero -- his values are not ours -- he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank. robber, a killer of men. His sympathies are not for fences, for trolleys.and telegraphs or better schools. He lives outside and against society because he believes in that way of life and if he has moments of sympathy for others, moments of regret, t hey ' are short lived. He is not a 'good man' according to the righteous... To them he is totally bad, and he wouldn't have it any other way. Next to him DUTCH ENGSTROM wears the uniform of a sergeant. Dutch is bigâ good-natured with a fast gun hand, strong loyalty and, like Pike, a bone deep distaste for rules and regulations. He can sing,. has more than his share of charm, but believes in nothing except two men, and Pike is one. Behind them ride two brothers, LYLE and TECTOR GORCH, dressed as corporals. Lyle and Tector are big, tough, hot tempered and sudden. They work together, eat together and 
CONTINUED 
2 CONTINUED sometimes sleep together with the same whore. Brutal, vicious in a fight, illiterate,. they are always pressing for an advantage and once they get it -- they never let go. They are without loyalty or honor, to anyone except each other and that is limited. A fifth man wears the single stripe of a PFC. This is. AL'GEL. Angel is a good-looking, bilingual Mexican boy in his middle 20's who has seen so much blood and violence and cruelty under Diaz that he rebelled -- but his rebellion was not with Villa or Obregon, his was a one-man revolution against them all. He believes in his family, his village and the inherent dignity of. man (some men at least). " He is faster than his companions with a gun -- and a better shot -- but he can't. laugh at the loss of love or suffer the loss of pride -- Mexican pride - a pride that can kill him, but if it does,. he will have no regrets. REACHING THE SIGN THE MEN STOP. Witut.speaking they, begin to brush off their clothing and get their uniforms in order. 
4 THE SIGN READS IN RAILROAD LETTERS: SAN RAFAEL, TEXAS And underneath, someone has printed: 
Wï¿½LCO ME TO SAN RAFAEL 
THE SEVENTH OLDEST TOWN IN SOUTH TEXAS 
FOUNDED 1703, POPULATION 5 
1914, POPULATION 2682 
STAY ON AND GROW WITH OUR COMMUNITY PIKE' AND ' DUTCH STARE FOR A MOMENT AT THE SIGN, slightly bemused. _ 
DUTCH Make you feel welcome? 
PIKE 
(DRYLY) It helps.. 
TEC TOR What's it say? 
ANGEL (baiting him) It invites us to stay with the community and grow. It is here, perhaps with time and small miracle -- that you could be taught to read. 
CONTINUED 
5 CONTINUED Tector looks at Angel for a long moment, then turns to Pike. 
TECTOR I never enlisted to serve with no smart-mouthed kid. 
ANGEL Nor I with dogs. 
DUTCH (grinning at Pike) ITd like to transfer to another unit -- there seems to be dissension in the ranks. 
PIKE (t0 Teotor and Angel) Itll transfer both of you -- just one more word. They look at him silently. He means it. Finally Tike spurs his horse and the group sta'ts for town, CAMERA PANNING. THEM PAST. THE STATt.ON Aï¿½M BOXCARS into a side street. 
EXT.. MAIN SQUARE OF SAN RAFAEL DAY 
THE SQUARE. SHOWS THE MEXICAN/SPANISH INFLUENCE AND.IS CROWDED with weekend visitors. Men,. women and children are. milling about, shopping and idly trading gossip.. The town.has the look of turn of the century Americana along with its.Spanisn heritage. The group of soldiers enter almost unnoticed.- Riding downethe street they pass: A LARGE TENT IN FRONT OF WHICH IS A BANNER ANNOUNCING a W.C.T.U. meeting, which, according to the SOUNDS of the bass drum and a sermon denouncing rum, is presently going on inside. 
SPEAKER (OS) Leviticus. 10.9. Do not drink wine or strong drink thou,nor thy sons with thee least ye die. It shall be a statute forever. Look. not though. upon. the. wine when it. is red when it giveth his color in the cup when it moveth itself aright at the last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder. 
CONTINUED 
CONTINUED 
SPEAKER (OS) (CONTID) 
(THEN) That is in the good book.. but here in this town, it is five cents a glass. Five cents a glass, does anyone think that that is really the price of a ----drink? The price of a drink let him decide who has lost his courage and his pride and who lies a govelling heap of clay not far removed from a beast today.- 
CONGREGATION (OS) I hereby solemnly procaise, God helping me, to abstain from all di stilled, fer- mented and malt ligi34rs3 including wine, beer and cider, and to employ all proper means to discourage the Ilse of and. traffic in the same. 
AS THE GROUP RIDES AROUND THE SQUARE,. THREE. SOLDIERS, ABE,. PHIL AND BURT, at the hitching rail on one side of the street,. turn and keep pace with the group on horseback. 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE THREE OTHER SOLDIERS, 
BUCK, FRANK AND CRAZY LEE, DO THE SAME. 
10 PIKE AND HIS GROUP RIDE PAST THE GENERAL STORE AND THE 
SALOON. AT Tï¿½- END OF THE STREET, THEY DISMOUNT ACROSS FROM THE YELLOW AND BROWN RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION BUILDING. As they swing out of the saddle the other ' soldiers' join them. 1l.' PIKE AND HIS COMPANIONS REMOVE EMPTY SADDLE BAGS FROM their horses and step onto the boardwalk or sidewalk that surrounds the'square. Some passersby look curiously. 
PAYMASTER (reaching for air) What is it?...What do you want? 25 DUTCH., LYLE AND THE. OTHER MEN SWIFTLY MOVE behind the counter. Pike ignores the paymaster and turns to: 26 CRAZY LEE STRINGFELLOW,. a young, compulsive killer with just enough sense to. pour piss out of a boot (if the instructions were printed on the heel: (the instructions are -- to pour, tip!) 
PIKE If they move, kill them. C.L. grins happily and squats on the floor, his 12 gauge pump shotgun angled up at: 
27 THE TERRIFIED PAYMASTER, HIS TWO ASSISTANTS AND MARGARET, A HATCHET-FACED HARRIDAN IN HER FIFTIES i,iho enters the office carrying. a.wrapped package and is instantly shoved into. a corner with the other prisoners. 28 ON THE STREET -- THE W.C.T.U. BASS DRUM BOOMS CLOSER as the parade picks up kids and other scoffing supporters as it moves around the square. . People and their children are crowding through the trees to the boardwalk to watch the band. and group of believers following the_,. in a formation that is almost as rigid as. their song and their faces. 
29 ON THE ROOF TOP -- HARRIGAN AND THORNTON NERVOUSLY WATCH THE 
BAND.. THE OTHER MEN EQUALLY TENSE KEEP THEIR RIFLES TRAINED 
ON THE DOOR. 
EARRIGAN Damn them! The parade moves toward the saloon. 
THO RNTO N They should have been told: 
HARRI GAN Told-what!? Sus t how. long do you think anyone in this manure pile can keep his mouth shut? Before Thornton can answer: 30 T..C.. SHIFTS TO CHANGE POSITION and his hand. touches the tin roof, ,causing him to.yelp with pain.. The others snap a look in his. direction, then freeze as: 31 'VECTOR ON THE BOARDWALK. LOOKS UP,. SEES NOTHING, leans back against a rail watching the horses and the hymn singers. After a moment, he smiles a little, beating time,. as he remembers some forgotten march he watched from his daddy's shoulders. 
32 IN THE PAY OFFICE -- ANGEL CROSSES TO THE WINDOW AS THE NOISE FROM THE PARADE GROWS LOUDER. He looks out Behind hi:: 3.3 PIKE AND THE OTHERS ARE LOADING SACKS OF SILVER into their saddle bags. They are almost ready to. leave. The paymaster, his assistants and the customer, their hands still up, watch C.L. 
MARGARET Trash -- Filthy trash! 
C.L. (gently.) You just. hush now -- 
ANGEL People marching and singing coming down the street -- going to pass near the horses. 
CONTINUED 
33 CONTINUED 
C 
PIKE 
(GRINNING) Well, we'll just join in. Angel, turning away, hesitates, looking up through the window 
AT: 
34 SUNLIGHT GLEAMING OFF THE BARREL OF A GUN ON THE ROOF ACROSS 
THE STREET 
ANGEL Rifles -- one -- no three,. maybe more, on the roof. 
35 PIKE QUICKLY CROSSES TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKS OUT. 
PIKE Waiting for us 
(SOFTLY) Son of a bitch He turns and crosses quickly to the back door. Dutch follows. Pike opens it a little, looks ou.t at. 
EXT. REAR OF OFFICE'- DAY 
36 FRA? BUILDINGS AND BARE ADOBE HUTS SURROUNDED BY TRASH AND 
TIN CANS AND AMONG THEM THE INDISTINCT. FIGURES OF RIFLES AND HATS -- they are surrounded. - 37 IN THE OFFICE -- DUTCH JOINS PIKE AT THE DOOR and looks out, then curses softly. 
DUTCH How in hell could they have known we were coming? 
PIKE How in hell do I know? 
DUTCH Where do we go? 
-PIKE Out front -- that's where the horses are.. He shuts the door, crosses toward the paymaster. 
CONTINUED 
37 CONTINTJED 
C.L. We go ing..out back, Mr. Bishop? 
PIKE No, son -- we got company there too -- (as the boy looks at him) -Besides, when I travel, I like my feet to dangle. 
C.L. (indicating the prisoners) I kill 'em-now? 
PIKE (after a moment) No. You just hold them here and wait as long as you can -- after the shooting starts. 
C.L. 111-1 hold 'am till hell freezes over or you say different ! Pike, pushing the frightened paymaster in front of him, hesitates., looks. at C.L., then continues to . the door, grabs the handle, looks back again. 
38 C.L."IS CROUCHED IN FRONT OF THE TWO ASSISTANTS AND MARGARET., singing to himself, happy as a clam. 39 DUTCH, ANGEL AND THE OTHERS look at Pike. They are ready. 40 PIKE JERKS OPEN THE DOOR,. KICKS THE terrified paymaster out into the street. 
(SHARPLY) Come on pardner, let's get out of here. - 
PIKE (Grinning at him)- You.sound like you're all caught up, 
THORNTON Caught up enough to know we've overstayed our welcomes 
PIKE (Suddenly angry) What in hell is the matter with you? 
ELIZABETH Stay -- please, 
'PIKE 
(CONTINUES) We've got money.to spend and not a worry in the worlds 
(THEN) They're not going to look for us in their own backyard, 
(CONTINUED) 
CHANGE 
20-B 
101-4 (CONTINUED): 
THORNTON How can you be. so damned sure? He shakes off the girl, crosses to a sideboard, pours a drink.. 
PIKE 
(FLATLY) That's my business -- being sure. There is a knock at the door and. Thornton whirls. Elizabeth throws the bolt. 
THORNTON 
(SAVAGELY) Hold it! 
PIKE 
(GRINNING) Relax -- just a little champagne I ordered. 
101-D ELIZABETH. STICKS. OUT HER TONGUE AT THORNTON AND OPENS THE. DOOR and gunfire fills the room as: 
101-E A DEPUTY SHERIFF STEPS INTO THE DOORWAY-AND SHOOTS THORNTON high on the shoulder. Thornton. is knocked sprawling... The Deputy moves into the room (followed by three other men) and fires at Pike but misses, as. 101-F PIKE SLIPS PAST the screaming women into an adjoining room. The other men pursue.P.ike as the Deputy bends down and snaps Thornton's wrists together with handcuffs. The sound: of gunfire is heard from the street outside, then two of the men re-enter the room. The Deputy looks up.. 
DEPUTY Get him? The man shakes his head. 101-G THORNTON, HIS FACE TWISTED WITH PAIN AND BITTERNESS, makes no attempt â¢to struggle as he .is pulled to his feet and moved out the door. 
102, THEY ARE SILENT, RIDING, EVEN LYLE is embarrassed by this betrayal. 
PIKE He's had five years on the r ck pile, Dutch -- and twenty more to u go -- that.can hurt a man. 
LYLE (after a moment) Say -- I've heard it's like the.old times in Argentina...3utch Cassidy down. there making a killing... 
PIKE. Bolivia...but it'll be over there too, pretty soon. Those :pining companies will bring down a bunch .of hardcases and Butchtll get his.. 
(THEN) ..Every one of us is worth a year of drinking and whoring to any fool that can read a wanted poster and carry a gun. 
DUTCH 
(SOFTLY) Deke Thornton isn't just. any fool that can carry a gun and read-a wanted poster. 
PIKE Fo -- but he takes a dim view of 20 more years in the Carcel -- 
(THEN) We can hope he ain't on. our tail -- but don't bet on it.. 
LYLE 
(HAPPILY) Tector and I have been stealing since the big depression and we ain't never been caught. This Thornton don't bother us nohe.. 
PIKE 
(WEARY) I don't really give a damn about Deke Thornton...I just know that I'd surely like to aet the hell off. this horse. 
CUT TO: 
107 THORNTON-LOOKS AT HIM WHITE WITH ANGER, then .c ntrols it - he is trapped. Finally, he nods and moves away, then stops and turns back, his anger almost beyond any control. 
THORNTON Tell me, Mr. Harrigan.-- how does it feel? (as Harrigan looks at him) Getting paid for it? (stepping closer) -Getting paid to sit back and hire your killings with the law's arms around you? How does it feel to be so damned right;? 
HARR IGAN (after a moment, coldly) Good, Mr..Thornton...it feels good. 
THORNTON 
110 COFFER SWINGS OFF HIS HORSE FOLLOWED BY SEVERAL OTHERS. 
COFFER I knowed I wounded' three -- but I wasn't sure about -- 
THORNTON (as the others yell in 
PROTEST) Jabali:... 111 JABALI, AN AGING NAVAHO INDIAN trots up to.him'. 
THORNTON This pelt should clear you up -- take him back to town...and tell Harrigan to get me a list of every Army garrison and payroll schedule on the border. (to.the.others, crossing to his horse) We got another half hour of light and they might be just up ahead counting their money. 
EXT. BANDIT CAMP - DAY (SUNSET EFFECT) 
112 PIKE AND HIS MEN RIDE INTO THE RUINS OF A SMALL RANCHERO. A young boy takes their horses while an old.man and his wounded son (the father of the boy) watch. Behind them, an ancient woman pays no attention as she slaps tortillas into shape. Two small children watch, big-eyed. ;113 THE MEN ARE QUIET WITH FATIGUE AS THEY DISMOUNT AND TIE. j THEIR HORSES.. FREDDY SYKES, a skinny old man in tattered range clothes, crosses to Pike as he unloads his saddle bags. 
SYKES Them others ain't comin'? 
PIKE No. 
SYKES (after a moment) None of 'em? 111 PIKE TAKES THE BAGS OUT OF THE CORRAL TO THE FIRE that burns near an adobe wall and drops them on a poncho, watches as the others do the same. 
SYKES (joining him again; worried) But I got horses and gear for all them fellers like you said -- 
PIKE They won't need them -- we will. Sykes thinks this over, finally nods. a little and turns away. 115 LYLE AND HIS BROTHER AND DUTCH STAND in a half. circle around the poncho. waiting. Angel, the last, drops his saddle bag, then crosses to the wall and drops down to rest. For a long moment the men look down.a-t the pile of saddle bags. 
LYLE About the sharing up... 
PIKE 
(WEARILY) The sharing up's going to be the some as always. 
CONTINUED 
CHANGE 
115 CONTINUED 
LYLE (whining; pointing to 
ANGEL) Tector and I don? t like the idea of him getting the same as us...He's just starting out and this is our stake for new territory. Pike looks at him silently. He has heard this kind of argument many times in the past and it is obvious he is sick to death of it. Lyle finally looks awa- at his brother; 
TECTOR And I figure a 'share to that old man for watching the horses is a share too much. ll& PIKE TAKES A KNIFE OUT OF HIS BELT, opens a saddle bag,. takes out a sack of silver, kneels to slit the bag open. 
LYLE You hear me, Pike? -- I said it ain't fair... Pike stands,. flips the knife into the ground, faces the brothers. 
P IKE 
(SOFTLY) If you two boys don't like equal shares why in hell don't you just take it all? They look at him silently. 
117 DUTCH DRIFTS AWAY A LITTLE TO TIE SIDE OF PIKE. â¢SYKES MOVES OUT OF THE BACKGROUND, a buffalo gun now dangling from one arm. The brothers tense. Angel laughs softly. 
PIKE (almost a whisper) Well,..why don't you answer me, you dapnned yellow.-livered trash? The brothers fide, et., look at each other. 
LYLE Ah.--' Pike, you know... 
CONTINUED 
117 CONTINUED 
PIKE (his voice a whip) I don't know a damned thing except I either lead this bunch or I end it -- right now; 
LYLE No, sir -- we divide just as you say. Pike looks at them a moment, then picks up his knife and alicea open a bag and -turns it upside down and dumps the contents onto the spread-out poncho watching as: 
118 STEEL WASHERS POUR 01 0 THE PONCHO 119 THE GROUP IS SILENT IN DISBEL'EF staring at the pile of worthless steel. Hykes eases up, takes a cautious look. 
TECTOR Rings:, Steel rings! 
DUTCH. (quietly). Washers! 
120 PIKE TURNS AWAY. LYLE TAKES ANOTHER BAG AND CUTS INTO IT. More-washers pour out. _ 
PIKE (under his breath) Son of a bitch! 121 LYLE'S BOOT FLASHES INTO THE PILE. The washers fly in all directions. Lyle whirls on Pike. 
LYLE Washers...we shot our way out of that town for a dollar's worth of steel holes. He kicks into the pile and scatters Washers across the clearing. 
PIKE They set it up:

EXT. DESERT - DAY (SUNSET EFFECT) 
133 DEKE THORNTON AND THE BOUNTY HUNTERS ARE GROUPED AROUND A 
- FIRE EATING.. 
T.C. How close you figure we are? 
THORNTON Not close enough... They're across the border by now. - 
COFFER Deke - you rode with. Pike -- what kind of a man are we up against? 
THORNTON (after a long moment; softly) The best -- 
(THEN) 
CONTINUED 
CHANGE 
133 CONTINUED THORNTON (CONT tD ) He's never got caught. - (after a moment) And he won't be if you boys don't learn your trade. - 
FESS How was it -- then mm (as Thornton looks at him) You know -- in the old days? I only come out here last spring. 
THORNTON (after a long moment) You can saddle up or shut up -- take your choice -- 
COFFER (after a long moment) "What will he do? 
THORNTON That's what I have to figure. 
COFFER Maybe they'll split up. 
THORNTON No -- not 'that. bunch. They'll try again. - - 
T.C. How do you know?' But Thornton doesn't answer. 
EXT. PIKE'S CAMP - NIGHT 
134 PIKE AND DUTCH ARE SIDE BY SIDE IN THEIR blankets listening to Angel play the guitar. For several moments they are. silent, then: 
PIKE Didn't you run some kind of mine -- in Sonora? 
DUTCH Yeah, I helped run a little copper -- nothing for us there except day wages, if it was running now -- which it ain't. 
CHANGE 
3L.. 135 PIKE FINDS IT.IMPOSSIBLE TO get comfortable. Groaning and wincing with pain he shifts on the bedroll. 
PIKE Why in the hell, did you ever quit it? 
DUTCH Why in hell are you still goin'? 
PIKE I don.'t know"any better -- maybe don't want any better, (then, after a moment) Hell, I wouldn't know what to do with 'better' if it poked me.in the eye with a sharp stick. 
DUTCH (laughing softly) You -never gave it :a chance9 Pike. 
PIKE 
(ANGRY) I threw away more chances in one year that you will see in your whole.l.ife -- but that don't mean you have. to ' be a damn fool like me. Dutch sits up, rolls and lights a cigarette. 
DUTCH You got a halfway hard mouth, partner. 
PIKE What in hell do you want me to-say ,-? 
DUTCH Just don't give me, no lectures.. They are silent -- finally: 
PIKE: This was going to be my last, too... I'm not getting around any better -- like the red-haired lady said to the. white-haired judge -- 'I only got so many miles left -in my backside, Your Honor, and I aim to keep it moving while I'm still young enough to feel. what it's there for.' (a.s Dutch -laughs softly) I'd like to make a good score -. then back off. CONTINUED 
135 CONTINUED 
DUTCH Back off to what? (as Pike doesn't answer) Any real ideas for a next one? Pike closes his eyes and leans back. 
PIKE Pershing. has. got men spread over the whole border. Everyone of those garrisons is going to be.gptting payroll. 
DUTCH That kind of information is kind of. rough to come by. 
PIKE (sitting up) Well -- I don't figure it's going to .be easy, but it can be done. 
DUTCH. They'll be waiting for us. 
TECTOR 
(PIOUSLY) 'Pears 'Brother Pike' needs help, Brother Lyle. 
LYLE Riding with 'Brother Pike' and old .man Sykes makes a man wonder if it ain't time to pick up his chips and-find another game. 
TECTOR (suddenly yelling at Pike) How in hell are you going to side any- body if you can't get on a horse. 152 PIKE LOOKS AT THEM, THEN STEPS onto the makeshift stirrup and mounts, concealing his pain, taking a few seconds to gather up the reins and position himself. In the b.g., Dutch swings onto his horse. 
PIKE Were about two hours from the Santa Caterinas. He turns and rides toward the mountains, the men following. 
153 SYKES RIDES UP BESIDE PIKE 
SYKES That was a mighty fine talk you gave the boys 'bout stickin' to- gether. (as Pike doesn't 
ANSWER)

SYKES (CONT'D) That Gorch was near killin' me or me him --

PIKE We started together -- we'll end it together. 
SYKES By God, that's the way I see it -- that's the way it's always been with me...Sorry 'bout Deke - never figured him that way, (then, as Pike doesn't answer) Back in. San. Rafael -- my boy how' d. he do? They ride for a while in silence as: Pike. thinks this over, finally:. _ 
PIKE Your boy2 
SYKES C.L. -- Clarence Lee -- my daughter's boy ---not too bright, but a good boy -- He handle higself all right? -- I told him -- you do -- just what Mister Bishop says -- Did he conduct hisself well? 
PIKE (after a long moment) He did fine -- 
(THEN) Why didn't you tell me he was your grandson? 
SYKES Well, you had enough on your mind He had to pull his weight just like the rest of us -- just wanted to know he didn't let you down -- run. when things got hot -- 
PIKE (after a moment) No ---he did fine...just fine.

THORN TON AND THE BOUNTY HITTERS follow the wild bunch's 
trail. They are hot and tired and with the exception of Thornton,.. are apprehensive. Coffer pulls up, calls to Thornton: 
COFFER That culvert -- good place for them ----to make an ambush. 
THORNTON Go on - ride up and find out. Coffer hesitates, his -ayes wide with fear. Thornton draws his gun, pulls back the hammer. 
THORNTO1 
(SAVAGELY) Go onl Coffer rides forward. 
THORNTON (to the others) Next time I want advice from any of you scum I'll ask for it -- until then, keep . your mouths shut and do what y-ou' re to ld%

C OFFER 
(WHINING) We was supposed to go after them -- Thornton reins up, looks at Coffer, who looks quickly away. 
THORNTON You have something to say? Coffer instantly lifts his hands in submission and shakes his head. Then, after a moment: 
COFFER They say Freddy Sykes is with them -- you rode with the old man, didn't you, Mr. Thornton -- you and Pike and the old man? But Thornton rides on and doesn't answer. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ANGEL'S VILLAGE - DAY 
159 TECTOR AND LYLE ARE SEATED ON THE GROUND trying to duplicate the intricacies oÂ£ a very complicated cat's cradle demon- strated to them by ROCIO, the lovely bright-eyed 13 year old sister of Angel. Both men are drinking tequilla, but both are sober, entranced and completely dominated by the girl. All three straighten as: 160 CARMEN, ANGEL'S MOTHER, CALLS from a nearby fire where she is preparing food with her mother. 
CARMEN Miha -- trigame auga.por los frijolesl The girl jumps to her feet, hands both men a bucket (or olla) and leads.them down the bank to the river. (The natural beauty of this location should contrast with other landscapes in the picture. This village and its inhabitants represent a complete and green contrast to the arid world of the wild bunch), 
CWGE8 
161 AN GEL AND PIKE SEATED IN THE THATCHED SHADE OF A RAMADA WITH 
DON JOSE, ANGEL'S GRANDFATHER, WATCH SILENTLY. SYKES IS A FEW FEET AWAY. Angel watches dully,. his eyes mirroring his agony. Pike laughs softly, watching. 
PIKE Hard to believe. 
DON JOSE Not so hard -- we all dream of being a-child again -- even the worst of us -- perhaps the worst most of all.. 
PIKE (looking: at him) You know us, then -- 
DON JOSE I know myself only -- where I have been, what I have done. 
PIKE Like to ride with us, old man? And for a moment, the old man's eyes flash as he watches: 162- DUTCH AND THREEVILLAGERS SHOEING a very small, very mean 16L. mule. All four have been drinking a little and are thoroughly enjoying themselves as is the mule as he pitches and knocks them all sprawling.. 
DON JOSE -- I am too old. (almost cursing, indicating 
SYKES) .Too old even to ride beside this ancient gringo. 
165 SYKES LAUGHS AND DRINKS 
SYKES Hell, you ain't so old; partner. 
166 ANGEL STANDS, TURNS TO THEM 
ANGEL 
(BITTERLY) And the soldier. who shot my father what was his name? 
CONTINUED 
166 CONTINUED 
DON JOSE They were many -- who shot -- your father resisted like a man and died like a man -- names in this matter have no importance. (to Pike proudly) I killed one; (as Pike looks at him) I lie -- I ran -- 
SYKES Joe --'by God I like you. I like a man who tells the truth. 
ANGEL 
181 HIS GRANDFATHER, WATCHING PIKE AND DUTCH AND CARMALITA, laughing softly to himself, finally turns, his smile fading. 
DON JOSE Why do you wish to know -- for your father - or the whore? Pike looks up as Angel fights within himself to find an answer, 
PIKE 
(FINALLY) It doesn't make any difference, kid our business is in Agua Verde For a moment Angel looks like he will explode, then he lifts a bottle of tequi.lla in salute to Pike. 
ANGEL As you say, Jefe - to Agua Verde and 'our business.' 
CUT TO: 
EXT.. AGUA VERDE PLAZA - DAY 
182 PIKE AND THE-OTHER It N ARE WATERING THEIR HORSES under the shade of several large trees in the main plaza of Agua Verde,. The town itself is dull and sun colored like. the surrounding country.

ANGEL (joining Pike) He's been here; 186 THE HORSES PUT THEIR EARS BACK and whinny nervously as an incredible noise is heard off scene. The men snap their heads.around and look at: 
187 A HUGE CLOUD OF DUST FROM THE EDGE OF T1 014N MOVING DOWN THE STREET towards the plaza. Inside is the almost ghostlike appearance of a 1912 or 1913 touring car. Four mounted men are riding on each side and a host of small.children are running, screaming, behind it. 
188 THE CAR PULLS UP IN FRONT OF THE CANTINA-LIKE BUILDING. 
SIX MEN GET OUT AND TWO OF THEM INSTANTLY BEGIN DUSTING AND POLISHING. The mounted guards. take up positions around the vehicle. The group shows deference to a large man wearing general's braid. -EL 'MAPACHE. Next to him is his second in command, ZAMORRA. The third man dressed in white linen is MOHR, a German military advisor. With him is ERNST, his aide. 189 PIKE AND THE OTHERS WATCH with interest as the men enter a cantina-like building. Then without a word they cross the

SYKES Pike... .I heard about one they got up north that. kin fly; Pike nods sagely. Te.ctor Gorch on the other side of the car hears the remark. 
TECTOR 
(SCORNFULLY) .That was a balloon ,you damned old fool. 
PIKE No,. the old man's right. They -got t em now with motors and wings -- cover 60 miles in less than an hour...goin' to use them in the war, they say. (as T(ector looks at him astonished) This could cover. 30 miles in an hour -- ' cording to the road, of course. 
DUTCH That could run a horse right into the ground. 
PIKE Not that easy -- these automobiles can't stand.any rough ground -- or hot sun like a horse ---they're for show mostly. 191 TECTOR TOUCHES A FENDER AND ONE of the guards spurs toward him, cursing in Spanish. Tector backs off,. hands in the air.

MAPACHE Qua basura es este? Mapache again. kicks Angel.. 
ZAMORRA Why did he try to kill His Excellency...? 
PIKE He didn't, he was. after the girl... Mapache is having difficulty understanding. He looks at Z'amorra with a puzzled expression. 
ZAMORRA La.muchacha,.. 
DUTCH Era su novia; The Mexicans immediately respond to Dutch's explanation. Both Z.amorra and Mapache smile. 
O MAP ACHE 
(PLEASED) His fiancee??... 
PIKE He went a little crazy when he saw her with you. Mapache laughs. His ego is pleased with the idea that.he had taken someone's woman. He turns and explains grandly in Spanish to the rest of. the cantina. 
MA PA CHE Mato su vieja porque salio con El Mapache; The soldiers in the cantina laugh and ad lib their response..

MOHR (.to Pike) Are you men in Agua Verde for business? 
PIKE. Thought we might sell a few horses. 
MOHR You must have been associated with the American Army, is that riot so? Tector and Lyle snicker slightly at the remark. Mapache and Zamorra turn, listening carefully to the conversation. The cantina is silent. 
DUTCH -No -- were not associated with anyone... 
MOHR I see,..1 was curious because of.the equipment which you are carrying. (as they look at him) That pistol is restricted for use'by army personnel. It can't be purchased or even owned... legally. 
-PIKE 
(GUARDEDLY) Is that so? - - 
MOHR You're surprised at my interest? (then as Pike doesn't answer) Weapons are a specialty of mine. Mohr bows his head slightly and clicks his heels barely audib3y, 
MOHR I am Commander Frederick Mohr-of the Imperial German. Army. For the last six- months I have been in Mexico helping fight against the revolutionaries. 212. ANGEL ON THE FLOOR IS CONSCIOUS, but uimoving., listening to what is being said. Several of Mapache's men stand around him.

THO RNTO N (turning to them) Dutch Engstrom...going from the village. 
COFFER $1000 dead or alive. 
T.C.- Bet they sold the guns. 
THORN TON ,,-Coming out one at a time. i (then, crossing to his horse) We'll get down at the bottom of the wash and see if we can thin the odds a little. He mounts and they ride off. 
EXT. CAMP - DAY 
DUTCH HAS DISMOUNTED AND IS TALKING TO PIKE AND THE OTHERS. On a ridge above camp, using binoculars, they look across the badlands below and at the town far in the distance. 
LYLE Well, he had guts -- 
PIAE 
(SOFTLY ) We're just lucky he didn't talk. 
DUTCH Yeah - he played his string out right to the end. 
PIKE We take one sack to pay our way. Bury the rest -- together. They think this over, then nod. 
EXT. BADLANDS - DAY 
437 THE BOUNTY HUNTERS CRASH through the brush into a small clearing, then split up, looking for tracks. The country around them is a maze of rocks and thick mesquite and chaparral. Sykes' horse, blood running. down its flanks, is standing in the clearing,-grazing. 
T.,C. He can't be far. 
COFFER Lots of blood over here -- then it stops and no tracks.

437 CONTINUED 
T. C. We'11 find him. Ten dollars says he's dead by now. 
THORNTON .It'll take us a day to find him if he is -- if he isn't, he's holding a gun on us right now. 438 THE IAN TENSE,-THEIR WEAPONS coming up. 
THORNTON We'll go after the others. 
JESS Just leaving him here? He's worth money. 
THORNTON (softly, bitterly) Jess, you come back tomorrow and watch the buzzards. They'll show you where he is -- you might even get a pair of. boots. Jess thinks this over and grins, then the smile fades. 
JESS But what if he ain't dead? 
THORNTON Your problem.. He turns his horse and rides away,. the others following, 439 SYKES, HIDDEN IN THE ROCKS and brush above them,â¢slowly lowers his rifle and sags back. His leg is dark with dried blood and he's weak. Around the wound is a crude bandage made from his shirt -- with a tourniquet twisted tightly above it. After a moment, there is a noise and he looks away at: 
440 THE FIGURE OF A MEXICAN PEON -- BLURRED AND INDISTINCT AGAINST THE RAYS of the late afternoon sun, a machete dangling from his hand. 
EXT. CAMP AREA - DAY 
PIKE AND THE OTHERS NOW MOUNTED, look over the camp.

DUTCH 
(RISING) Angel?... 
PIKE Yeah. 464 THEY CROSS TO THEIR HORSES, THEIR DRUNKENNESS LESSENING with every step. Pike and Dutch pull rifles. or shotguns from their saddle scab- bards as do . Lyle.and-Tector,. then they move up the village street..

PIKE We want Angel; Mapache stares at them without answering. 
ZAMORRA. You are very stupid...very stupid!

474 ZAMORRA, STILL SEATED at the table pours himself a drink, the clink of the glass against the bottle loud in the silence. Beside him the.Germans rise slowly. Mapache, still holding Angel from behind, leans over his shoulder and whispers in his ear:

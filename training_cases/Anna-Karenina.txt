Based on the novel by Leo Tolstoy. 
INT. POKROVSKOE--NIGHT 
CLOSE--Expert fingers--female, unlovely, capable--shape a small lump of dough which, with some shreds of cabbage, becomes a filled bun called a pirozhok . . . which is now placed on a baking tray to join rows of pirozhoki ready for the oven. 
CLOSE-- One hand opens the oven, and, mittened by an apron, removes a tray of perfectly baked pirozhoki, which the other hand replaces with the fresh tray . . . slightly burning itself on a knuckle. 
TITLE OVER: FEBRUARY 1872 POKROVSKOE, KONSTANTIN LEVIN'S ESTATE 300 MILES SOUTH OF MOSCOW: 
INT. KITCHEN, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--NIGHT 
Agafia sucks her knuckle and checks what's cooking on the stove-top. She is the cook-housekeeper. 
AGAFIA He needs to come in if he's to wash himself. 
A Kitchen Maid at the sink obediently dries her hands on her apron. A dozing dog, Laska, pricks up her ears. 
EXT. YARD, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--NIGHT 
It's snowing. The Kitchen Maid, shawled, with a lantern, makes her way across the yard towards the cowshed, a short distance, and pushes open the frozen door. Laska is at her heels, but is made to stay outside. 
INT. COWSHED, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--NIGHT 
The herd stirs at the lantern light. The bull, Berkut, with a ring through his nose, snorts as the girl goes by. At the back of the shed a cow is calving. 
Levin is midwifing, sleeves pulled back, blood and slime up to his elbows. He is 34. His steward, Vasili, holds up a lantern. Levin pulls carefully at the emerging forefeet. 
LEVIN Good girl . . . good girl, Pava. 
The calf's head emerges. 
KITCHEN MAID (ARRIVING) Agafia Mishaylovna says dinner's like to spoil. 
The calf enters the world like a diver. Levin is feeling great pride and pleasure. 
LEVIN . . . her father's colour. 
VASILI Worth coming home for, Konstantin Dmitrich! 
LEVIN I stayed too long in Moscow. 
The cow nuzzles and licks her calf. 
INT. DINING ROOM, POKROVSKOE--NIGHT 
Cleaned up, in a smock shirt, Levin bites hungrily into a pirozhok, talking. He has a book on a book-rest. Agafia ladles soup for him. Three generations of family portraits look down on him. 
LEVIN . . . She's a beauty. That's twelve cows sired by Berkut! 
AGAFIA So one of you is doing what the good Lord made you for. 
Levin evades, ducks into spooning up soup, finding his place in his book. Agafia goes out. Alone, Levin closes the book and stares into himself. 
INT. (MOSCOW)-- DAY 
CLOSE--Expert fingers scrape a cut-throat razor across a lathered cheek . . . and again, skirting luxuriant facial hair on pampered skin. 
TITLE OVER: PRINCE OBLONSKY'S HOUSE, MOSCOW 
INT. OBLONSKY'S DRESSING ROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE, SAME TIME-- DAY 
There is a door to the landing and a door to the bedroom. 
Prince Stepan Oblonsky-- Stiva to his friends--is 34 and liked by every- body. A barber comes in every morning to shave him. His valet, Matvey, is older and almost a friend. He holds up an enormous pear. 
MATVEY What should I do with this? 
Oblonsky puts the barber on hold to have a look. 
OBLONSKY Where did you find it? 
MATVEY In your hat. Your Excellency. 
Oblonsky thinks about it, lets the barber finish. He stands and removes his dressing gown. 
OBLONSKY Yes . . . I picked it up somewhere for Daria Alexandrovna and the children. 
Matvey is ready with Oblonsky's shirt, which he puts over his master's head like a horse's collar. 
INT. "DAY NURSERY," OBLONSKY HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY 
There is a sloping lineup of five children, aged eight, five, four, three and two, dressed and brushed for presentation to their mother, Princess Daria Oblonsky, known as Dolly . . . who we now see is heavily pregnant. Stand- ing by is a French governess, Mlle. Roland, and a Nurse. Mlle. Roland is buxom. 
Dolly picks up the youngest, Vasya, to kiss him and hands him to the Nurse, and kisses the others in ascending order. 
DOLLY Bonjour, Lili; bonjour, Masha; bonjour, Grisha; bonjour, Tanya. 
Who's coming to see Grandmama? 
INT. OBLONSKY'S DRESSING ROOM, SAME TIME-- DAY 
Oblonsky, dressed now and holding a cup of coffee, checks from the window. 
OBLONSKY'S POV-- 
INT. OBLONSKY'S DRESSING ROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE--DAY 
Oblonsky has been bunking down on his couch. He moans and groans. He gets up and tries the door to the bedroom. It's locked. He knocks timidly. 
OBLONSKY (PITEOUSLY) Dolly . . . please think of the children . . . 
He listens hopefully. The other door, leading to the upper landing, is opened violently by Dolly. 
DOLLY You think of the children! Their lives are ruined now! 
She slams the door behind her. 
INT. BEDROOM LEVEL, OBLONSKY HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY 
Oblonsky comes out of his dressing room to see the main bedroom door slammed. He attempts to go in but the door is locked. 
OBLONSKY Oh, Dolly . . . I beg you . . . 
Matvey come to the top of the stairs with a telegram. 
MATVEY Telegram. Should I send up the barber? 
OBLONSKY No, just the razor. 
Oblonsky tears open the telegram. 
MATVEY Don't worry, sir, things will shape them- selves, you'll see. 
OBLONSKY (RELIEVED) My sister Anna's coming tomorrow. We're saved. 
INT. OBLONSKY'S OFFICE, MOSCOW--DAY 
Inner doors open and Oblonsky comes out of his private office. He is his genial self. Everyone in the general office-- minor officials, clerks-- stands up for him and bows. Oblonsky is wearing government uniform--green coat with gold embroidery on the collar--instead of his own coat. Oblonsky is helped out of one coat into the other. 
DOORKEEPER Some man came without an appointment, Your Excellency . . . waiting outside. 
Oblonsky opens the door to look. Levin is sitting waiting on a bench, wear- ing a sheepskin coat, cap and scuffed boots. 
OBLONSKY Levin! Where did you disappear? 
He seizes Levin and kisses him. 
LEVIN (NERVOUS) I'm very anxious to see you. I need your advice. 
OBLONSKY Well, then, come into my room. 
Oblonsky leads Levin back through the general office, where everyone stands up again. Levin's sheepskin and boots attract curious glances. 
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) This is my oldest friend, Konstantin Dmit- rich Levin! Someone send word I'll be a few minutes late. 
INT. OBLONSKY'S PRIVATE OFFICE, SAME TIME--DAY 
Oblonsky leads Levin inside and closes the door. 
OBLONSKY I've been hard at it. Sit down. 
Levin undoes his coat and sits down. 
LEVIN Hard at what exactly? 
OBLONSKY Why, we're overwhelmed with work! 
LEVIN Oh--paperwork. 
OBLONSKY Paperwork is the soul of Russia. Farming is only the stomach. When am I going to come and shoot some snipe? 
Seeing the clothes Levin is wearing, he laughs. 
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) Oh, but look at you, in Western clothes you told me you'd never wear again. Some- thing's up. 
LEVIN Yes. I'm in love. I've come back to propose. Have you guessed who she is? 
OBLONSKY (rolls his eyes comically) I have a suspicion. Why didn't you propose when you were here? 
LEVIN I decided it was impossible. Kitty is of the heavens, an angel, and I am of the earth-- but then I thought and thought, and . . . there's no life for me without her! . . . Do I have a chance? 
OBLONSKY Of course you do. The Shcherbatskys are giving a soiree this evening. Get there early before the crowd. If I may suggest . . . 
LEVIN Anything! What? 
OBLONSKY New boots. 
LEVIN Right. Anything else? 
OBLONSKY (HESITATES) We'd better have dinner together. 
Come on, we'll meet later at l'Angleterre. Or do you prefer the Hermitage? 
Oblonsky ushers Levin back into the general office. 
INT. GENERAL OFFICE, SAME TIME--DAY 
. . . Everyone stands up as before. The Doorkeeper produces Oblonsky's top- coat and helps him into it. 
OBLONSKY No--five-thirty at l'Angleterre--I owe them more than the Hermitage, so it wouldn't be fair to withdraw my custom. (taking his hat) Boots, and a coat. And a proper hat. 
He ushers Levin out. 
EXT. L'ANGLETERRE RESTAURANT, MOSCOW--DAY 
Firstly, a Moscow street scene, busy with people going about their business, on foot and in conveyances. 
Anna, found out, smiles tentatively. 
ANNA Was it love? 
COUNTESS VRONSKY Always. My sons are ashamed of me. But I'd rather end up wishing I hadn't than end up wishing I had--wouldn't you? 
ANNA I . . . I don't know . . . 
Anna looks at the snow on the window. She is unsettled by the conversation. 
EXT. SHCHERBATSKY HOUSE. MOSCOW--NIGHT 
A sleigh (i.e., a cab) brings Levin. 
INT. ENTRANCE HALL, SHCHERBATSKY HOUSE, SAME TIME--NIGHT 
The Hall Porter lets Levin into the house. A Footman takes Levin's hat and coat. Levin is uneasy--he seems to be first to arrive. He decides he has come too early. He pulls his coat back from the Footman. 
LEVIN I'll come back. 
UP ABOVE 
Princess Ekaterina (Kitty) Shcherbatsky is eighteen. Eager to see who has arrived, she hurries from the direction of the reception room and looks down into the entrance hall in time to see Levin snatch his hat back from the Footman. 
KITTY Konstantin! 
LEVIN I'm too early. 
KITTY (PLEASED) No! Come up! 
DOWN BELOW 
Kitty runs off out of Levin's view. He flings his hat and coat at the Foot- man and runs up the stairs. 
INT. RECEPTION ROOM, SHCHERBATSKY HOUSE, SAME TIME--NIGHT 
Levin hurries in and finds Kitty seated prettily in a "receiving" pose. She is alone. 
KITTY Look at me! I'm receiving for Papa and Maman who are late to dress. It's my first reception. 
Levin plays along, kissing her hand elaborately. 
LEVIN Princess Ekaterina! Delighted, delighted! 
KITTY ( FORMAL) I'm so pleased you were able to be with us, Konstantin Dmitrich! 
LEVIN (DROPPING IT) Kitty . . . you look . . . you look-- 
KITTY Stiva told us you were back. How long are you staying? 
LEVIN I don't know. It depends on you. 
KITTY On me? 
He has got ahead of himself. Doors are flung open and the hosts, Prince and Princess Shcherbatsky, and a crowd of guests who have arrived together, are greeting each other. Levin has to make a quick decision, and he makes the wrong one--to go on. 
LEVIN What I mean to say--I came with only one purpose--I want to--will you be my wife? 
Kitty panics. A wave of Guests is almost upon her. 
LEVIN (CONT'D) I'm sorry--sorry--wrong moment--but will you? 
KITTY I can't. I'm sorry. 
Kitty flees. Levin seems stunned, surrounded now by greetings, laughter, and servants with trays of drinks. 
LEVIN Yes. It was impossible. 
Prince and Princess Shcherbatsky receive a young married member of Kitty's set, Countess Nordston . . . and introduce Levin, who hears and sees noth- ing. He turns away, leaving the Countess hung out to dry. 
Levin finds himself face to face with Burisov, a silky Officer in sky blue uniform, who introduces himself. 
BURISOV Burisov. Are you the brother of Nikolai Levin? 
LEVIN Yes. 
BURISOV He's in Moscow, he's staying at the Unicorn in Khitrovka. 
LEVIN How do you know? 
BURISOV (SMILES) It's the sort of thing I know. 
He bows to Levin and turns away to greet someone. 
Levin reacts, decides to leave. He makes for the door. He nearly collides with someone, gives and receives an apology, and suddenly understands who this man in Guards uniform must be. Levin turns. 
LEVIN Count Vronsky? 
VRONSKY Yes. 
Levin pauses awkwardly. Vronsky hesitates, bows and continues on. Levin witnesses Kitty seeing Vronsky approaching, and sees her face light up. Vronsky kisses her hand. 
VRONSKY (CONT'D) (BANTERING) Princess Kitty . . . It's been so long, and yet it seems like yesterday. 
His banter is lost on her. She laughs happily. 
KITTY It was yesterday! 
Levin turns away and leaves. 
EXT. SHCHERBATSKY HOUSE--NIGHT 
VRONSKY Hello, what's this? 
GUARDS OFFICER Austrian royalty on their honeymoon. I've got them for four days. 
VRONSKY Bad luck. What do they like? Art? 
GUARDS OFFICER Food. 
VRONSKY Here's the train. 
EXT. PLATFORM, THE ARRIVING TRAIN, SAME TIME--DAY 
Vronsky moves closer to the slowing train, scanning the windows going by. 
EXT. PLATFORM ENTRANCE GATE, SAME TIME--DAY 
The Guards Officer and the Stationmaster are disconcerted to see the obvious "private coach" stop seriously short (or long) behind luggage wagons, etc. 
STATIONMASTER I'll see to it. 
He hurries away towards the engine. 
Oblonsky hurries through, relieved not to be late. 
EXT. PLATFORM, SAME TIME--DAY 
Vronsky is saluted by his mother's Major Domo, a tall man in livery with a cockade. 
MAJOR DOMO Second carriage, Your Excellency. I'll see to the Countess's luggage and bring it on to the house. 
Vronsky nods, and makes his way towards the second coach, against the flow of disembarked passengers. 
EXT. TRAIN (ENGINE), SAME TIME 
The Stationmaster speaks to the Engine Driver. 
EXT. EXIT/ENTRANCE GATE, SAME TIME--DAY 
The Guards Officer with the bouquet stands uncertainly while arriving passengers go past him. 
EXT. "PRIVATE COACH," SAME TIME--DAY 
The Royal Austrian Honeymooners peer anxiously through the window. 
INT. TRAIN, SAME TIME-- DAY 
Countess Vronsky remains sitting. Annushka packs away Anna's blanket and pillow. Anna looks out of the window. 
ANNA I'll come back. 
Anna moves to the door opening on to the "porch." Vronsky is on the point of entering. He steps back to allow her by. They barely exchange a glance as she passes him, but, simultaneously, each of them looks back. Anna looks away quickly. His look lingers before he turns away to enter the carriage. 
INT./EXT. PORCH--DAY 
Anna, from her vantage point spots Oblonsky, calls to him. Annushka, with her bag, comes onto the porch and descends to follow her mistress. 
EXT. PLATFORM, SAME TIME--DAY 
Anna steps down to the platform and embraces Oblonsky. They are delighted to see each other. 
ANNA (ACCUSINGLY) You don't look ashamed. 
OBLONSKY (CONTRITE) I am, I really am. 
INT. TRAIN, SAME TIME-- DAY 
Countess Vronsky remains in her seat. Vronsky bends at the window, look- ing at Oblonsky and Anna. 
VRONSKY Yes, of course. Oblonsky's sister . . . Karenina. 
COUNTESS Charmante, don't you think? (to her Maid) Wait for me in the carriage. I'll take Tosca. 
She takes the dog. The Maid leaves with her bag. 
VRONSKY . . . You stayed longer in St. Petersburg. 
COUNTESS VRONSKY Long enough for you to start a little love affair, I hear. 
VRONSKY I can't think what you're referring to, Maman. 
He glances back to the window, where Anna turns back to enter the train. 
EXT. PLATFORM, SAME TIME--DAY 
As Anna turns back, a Railwayman with a hammer for tapping wheels is in her way. He steps back for her with a bow and a "Madame!" Anna glances at him and moves past him. The man taps a wheel, making a ring- ing sound which means the wheel is okay. 
As Anna mounts the steps, a Train Guard looks up and down the plat- form, holding a green flag. 
INT. TRAIN, SAME TIME-- DAY 
Anna enters from the porch. 
ANNA There, Countess, you have found your son and I have found my brother. 
COUNTESS VRONSKY Madame Karenin has a son, too. It's the first time they have been apart, so she frets about him. 
VRONSKY Excuse me for not recognizing you before. 
COUNTESS VRONSKY We passed the time telling each other about our sons. 
ANNA Yes, I've been hearing all about you. 
INT. RECEPTION ROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE--DAY 
Anna, Kitty, Tanya and Grisha are at a handsome card table where board games, dominoes, cards, etc., are kept. There is a spill of alphabet bricks, each with a letter printed in it. They are spelling out their names in alphabet bricks. Grisha is on Anna's lap pulling at her hair. The spelling business, including misspellings by Grisha, creates a noise of laughter and mock-rebuke. Tanya at the same time is trying to pull a ring from Anna's finger. 
Kitty is not at all frightened of Anna now; enraptured by her, laughing. 
ANNA Grisha, don't pull so hard, you're getting it all in a tangle--and look for another G for GRIGORI-- (She takes off her ring for Tanya) --here, darling, you can wear it till you go TO BED-- 
Dolly sits apart, embroidering. She looks up at the sound of voices down- stairs, Oblonsky coming home. The children hear their father and abandon the card table, running out to greet him. Dolly stands up to leave by a dif- ferent door, giving Anna a collusive glance. 
Anna pushes aside the alphabet bricks. 
ANNA (CONT'D) Well, that's the end of that. 
KITTY Will you stay for the Bobrishchev's ball, Anna? 
ANNA Oh . . . I always feel dull at a ball. 
KITTY How can you ever be dull? 
Oblonsky arrives in the doorway with Tanya and Grisha hanging on him. 
KITTY (CONT'D) Stiva! Tell Anna she must come to the ball. 
OBLONSKY Of course she must. 
He cocks an eye at Anna: how did it go with Dolly? Anna moves her head: upstairs. 
ANNA . . . and God go with you. 
Kitty catches the moment. 
OBLONSKY (LEAVING) You can introduce me to your new governess. 
TANYA She's old! She's a hundred! 
Which leaves Anna and Kitty alone. 
ANNA I know why you want me to come. You want everyone to be there because you're sure it's going to be your night. 
KITTY How did you know? 
Anna's smile is her acting out a mock-mysteriousness. 
ANNA I know everything. 
She has moved alphabet letters around to spell out VRONSKY. She laughs at Kitty's tearful, joyful nodding, genuinely happy for Kitty. 
ANNA (CONT'D) Oh, to be your age again . . . surrounded by that blue mist, like mist on the mountains 
that clears slowly to reveal the terrifying, beautiful valley you must enter to become grown-up . . . I was eighteen too, when I got married . . . 
A quiet note of regret hangs in the air between them for a moment before Anna dispels it. 
INT. RECEPTION ROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE--NIGHT 
With only a lamp or two lit, and the door open, Anna sits alone at the card table, with a neglected book, one hand playing idly with the alpha- bet bricks. Their pleasant clicks are the only sound as she remains lost in thought. She closes her book, marking the place. She is going to go up to bed. She hears the sound of the doorbell. 
INT. ENTRANCE HALL, OBLONSKY HOUSE, SAME TIME--NIGHT 
Vronsky has been let in spattered with snow. 
SERVANT . . . no, Your Excellency . . . He's just gone up. . . . The Princess retired early . . . Is there a message? 
Vronsky glances up and sees Anna looking down. Their eyes meet. A second passes. Vronsky is about to speak. Anna turns away and moves out of his view, towards further stairs, with her book. 
VRONSKY No. 
EXT. NEAR POKROVSKOE--DAY 
Levin is coming home in a sleigh, driven by his one-eyed coachman, Ignat. He is huddled under a bearskin blanket. The house is in sight. 
The sleigh overtakes a Peasant Woman, Serafina, walking to the house car- rying a big bundle of willow wands strapped to her back: a strong young woman with a handsome face. She stops and bows her head. Levin looks at her. She then looks him in the face. 
Laska, barking joyfully, races from the house. 
INT. BATHHOUSE, POKROVSKOE-- DAY 
The bathhouse has a stove which heats water. There is a brazier to create instant steam, but not now. Levin, almost naked, lies on a plank deck, thoughtful, staring at something . . . no, at someone: Serafina, who is put- ting on her clothes. Postcoitum. She has no angst. Dressed, she crosses herself. 
LEVIN Will you go to confession? 
Serafina nods indifferently. 
LEVIN (CONT'D) God will forgive you. 
SERAFINA And you also, master. He is watching. 
LEVIN God forgive us then, for committing the act of love. 
She nods without irony. 
SERAFINA He is merciful. 
LEVIN "Not according to my deserts, O Lord, but according to thy mercy"--that's a fine prayer. But I'm full of doubt. Sometimes I even doubt that God exists. 
SERAFINA How can there be anything if God didn't make it? 
LEVIN I don't know. One day science will tell us. 
SERAFINA That's sinful talk if the priest heard you. 
Kitty looks for Vronsky, can't see him, then is taken aback to see him with Anna. Kitty watches Anna dancing. Anna says something which makes Vronsky laugh. Anna laughs. Anna blossoms in front of Kitty's eyes. Vron- sky twirls Anna around and she comes smiling into his arms. 
It goes on like that. Kitty watches them from within the arms of young men, old men, from the wall. Anna and Vronsky dance slow, they dance fast, gaily, solemnly, gazes locked. 
Others are noticing too: Countess Nordston, Princess Shcherbatsky, and eagle-eyed matrons. Anna, oblivious, has found a release in herself. 
Countess Nordston finds Kitty sitting alone. Korsunsky announces the Mazurka. 
COUNTESS NORDSTON You're not dancing the mazurka? I won't have it. 
She pulls Kitty to her feet. 
countess nordston (cont'd) I'm engaged by General Glub--I give him to you. 
THE MAZURKA . . . 
Korsunsky supervises a large circle of couples who change partners as they go round, with one couple dancing in the middle of the circle. 
KORSUNSKY . . . the lady chooses a lady and a gentleman . . . ! 
The lady in the middle beckons to Anna and the man who, changing part- ners, happens to be dancing with her. They enter the middle where they have their solo turn as a couple, while the original couple reenter the circum- ference. Anna is flushed with pleasure. Among the surrounding dancers, Vronsky has no eyes for his partner, only for Anna. Kitty, dancing, watches Vronsky incredulous. 
KORSUNSKY (CONT'D) (ADDRESSING ANNA) . . . and the lady chooses a lady and a gentleman . . . ! 
Anna looks smilingly around the dancing circle and sees Kitty staring at her. Anna "wakes up." Everything which made her drunk makes her sober in the instant. She waits until the change of partners brings Kitty and Vronsky together. She beckons them into the middle. Her own partner expects to re-join the circumference with Anna, but she makes an apology and escapes through the circle, running towards the door. 
With a howl and clatter, the St. Petersburg express seems to crash through the ballroom. 
MONTAGE 
An abstract, nightmarish, discordant noise of clattering and howling accompanies unexplained flame--light on wood, glass, iron . . . blackness opens like a door on a blizzard of light, and slams shut. 
Anna's face, eyes closed, floats ghostlike. 
INT. TRAIN, SAME TIME--NIGHT 
Anna comes to consciousness in the dimly lit carriage, making sense of what seems like a hallucination. Wind and snow batter on the window. The Carriage Stoker, in long coat and cap, deals with the stove, clears frost off a thermometer on the wall. He leaves, opening the door to snow and wind and slamming it behind him. 
EXT. RUSSIA--NIGHT 
The train "speeds" (35 m.p.h.) through a blizzard. 
INT. THE TRAIN 
Anna has a reading lamp hooked over her armrest, and a novel. She cuts a page with a paper-knife. But the book cannot hold her. She is reading without taking it in. She turns back a page and tries again, but almost at once she turns to the window where the dark reflection of her face looks back at her. Kitty's face staring as she stared at Anna, betrayed. 
Anna turns away from the window. The Guard comes through the door, letting in wind and snow, and shuts it. He walks through the carriage. 
GUARD Bologoye! Fifteen minutes. 
The train is slowing. 
EXT. BOLOGOYE--NIGHT 
The train clanks to a halt at a small station. Anna (and a few others) get down from the train. She wears a heavy cloak. The wind blows a few snowflakes through the station but the roof keeps off the snow. She is glad of the fresh air. Here and there, men are walking, smoking, laughing together. She feels better. 
A tall outline of a man in a greatcoat and military cap emerges from the flickering gloom. She catches her breath. He salutes her. 
VRONSKY Can I be of service to you? 
ANNA I didn't know you were . . . Why are you leaving? 
VRONSKY You know why. I have to be where you are. I can't not. 
ANNA This is wrong. If you're a good man, forget everything that happened, as I will. 
VRONSKY I'll never forget a single thing about you, not a word, not a gesture-- 
ANNA That's enough! 
She climbs the steps on to the porch. At the door to the carriage she pauses. The encounter has left her feeling elated and frightened. 
EXT. STATION, ST. PETERSBURG--DAY 
The train arrives. Vronsky gets down from the train and starts to walk towards Anna's carriage. His German valet, Franz, runs up to him (from second class). 
VRONSKY Take the luggage home. 
Franz runs back the other way. Vronsky walks on, then stops when he sees Karenin waiting on the platform, smiling and going forward to hand Anna down the steps. Kapitonich enters the carriage. Vronsky hesitates. 
ANNA (ANXIOUS) Is Serozha all right? 
KARENIN Oh, is that all I get? Yes, he's quite well. 
Vronsky steps forward. Anna knows he's there. She angles herself to avoid looking at him. 
VRONSKY Did you have a good night? 
He bows to Karenin. 
ANNA Yes, quite comfortable. Count Vronsky. 
Karenin extends a hand indifferently then dismisses Vronsky, drawing Anna with him. 
KARENIN I have to get back to the Committee . . . 
He walks Anna away. 
KARENIN (CONT'D) Well--were you a success? 
ANNA I? Oh--Dolly and Stiva . . . yes, I think so . . . 
He comes to bed in his nightshirt. 
KARENIN (CONT'D) Here it made quite a sensation. 
He gets into bed. Anna waits dead-eyed. Karenin blows his candle out. 
INT. KITTY'S ROOM, SHCHERBATSKY HOUSE, MOSCOW--DAY 
Kitty, a hollow-eyed version of herself, in a demure nightdress, sits upright on a chaise longue with her legs stretched out. The Family Doctor deferen- tially removes one of her slippers as though it were an intimate garment. 
FAMILY DOCTOR Forgive me, Princess, but I must . . . 
With a silver "fork" the Doctor tests the sole of her foot for a reflex. Kitty is miserably going along with a farce she despises. 
INT. OUTSIDE KITTY'S ROOM, SAME TIME--DAY 
The Prince and Princess are hovering. The Princess flutters with anxiety, the Prince is in a temper. 
PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY Am I the only one who knows what's wrong with her? 
But a Celebrity Doctor, as shiny as his own gold watch which he is check- ing, is bearing down on them, riding over a Footman's attempt to announce him. 
PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY Oh, thank God, doctor--my friends say you're the only one who can save her! 
CELEBRITY DOCTOR Possibly, Princess, possibly! At your service, Your Excellencies. Where is the patient? 
INT. KITTY'S ROOM, SAME TIME--DAY 
Kitty is sobbing with shame: the Celebrity Doctor has stripped her to the waist and is tapping her chest. The Family Doctor can't bear it and excuses himself. 
CELEBRITY DOCTOR Come, come, Princess, we are not backward people--I handle naked bodies every day. Deep breath now . . . 
INT. OUTSIDE KITTY'S ROOM, SAME TIME--DAY 
The Family Doctor and the parents are in a huddle. The Prince is apoplectic. 
PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY By God. I'll challenge the scoundrel! 
FAMILY DOCTOR It's the modern way . . . 
PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY (to the Prince) You're not a doctor! 
FAMILY DOCTOR Her symptoms . . . loss of appetite, fast PULSE-- 
PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY Well, whose pulse wouldn't be fast if some brute of a-- 
The Celebrity Doctor comes briskly out of Kitty's room, checking his watch. 
CELEBRITY DOCTOR Nervous palpitations. We must treat the nerves. A tubercular cavity is suspected, too soon to tell. Soden water every two hours. I must see her again tomorrow. (HE BOWS) Prince! Princess! 
He's gone. The Prince enters Kitty's room. 
INT. KITTY'S ROOM, SAME TIME--DAY 
Kitty is humiliated and triple-wrapped against the violation of her bosom. 
PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY Don't you fret, my little Kate! You'll wake up one fine morning and say to yourself--"I feel well and happy and I'll go out for a walk with Papa!" 
The Prince is mortified when Kitty's sobs redouble. 
INT. ART EXHIBITION, ST. PETERSBURG--DAY 
The social set Anna now moves in is the brilliant circle with connections to the Court on one hand and to the demi-monde of artists on the other. A leading light of this set is Princess Betsy Tverskaya, a rich society beauty. Betsy's immediate circle includes Tuskevich, her "admirer." 
Anna lifts her eyes to see Vronsky in front of her, talking to Betsy. Vronsky sees Anna and bows. She acknowledges him and kisses Betsy, and moves on, studying the next picture. Vronsky watches Anna move on. Betsy cocks an eye at him. 
INT. PIANO RECITAL, ST. PETERSBURG--DAY 
A few rows of chairs in someone's reception room, a mixed audience of guests, a flashy pianist . . . Betsy with a "toy" dog on her lap, Tuskevich on one side, Anna on the other. 
The dog yaps and sneezes. Betsy hands the dog to Tuskevich, who goes to exit with the dog. As Tuskevich leaves, Vronsky comes in. Anna sees him. She turns back to the piano. Betsy glances at her. 
EXT. PARK, ST. PETERSBURG--DAY 
Anna and Betsy, on a bright snow-white day, are being driven through a park in Betsy's smart equipage . . . towards a horseman walking towards them: Vronsky salutes the little carriage as it trots by him. Anna keeps looking straight ahead. Betsy acknowledges Vronsky's salute. 
BETSY I want to give a small dinner before the opera. Is there anyone you would like me to ask? 
ANNA Yes . . . Yes, the Metropolitan Bishop of St. Petersburg. 
Betsy laughs. 
INT. STAIRS AND ENTRANCE HALL, KARENIN HOUSE--NIGHT 
Annushka puts Anna's opera cloak over her shoulders, while Korney stands ready with Karenin's cloak and opera hat. Karenin comes down the stairs to join Anna. Kapitonich stands ready to let them out. 
KARENIN Countess Lydia tells me you haven't been to one of her evenings since you returned. 
ANNA The last one was to meet a missionary, the one before was for a lecture on the union of the Greek and Roman churches. (CLIMBS DOWN) I'm sorry--I know you're fond of her. Come on, or we'll be late. 
Kapitonich opens the door to let them out. 
INT. "FRENCH THEATRE," ST. PETERSBURG--NIGHT 
This is a small theatre with a "promenade" area where a group of Guards Officers of high and low rank mix together to enjoy the chanteuses, the comedians and the can-can girls. Vronsky is with his Commanding Officer, Colonel Demin. 
DEMIN Here's the thing, Vronsky. A posting has come up and there's a promotion in it for you. 
VRONSKY Thank you, sir. 
DEMIN The garrison in Tashkent. 
REVERSE 
Her self-possessed face, lit by fireworks, falls apart in misery. 
The firework display continues for a short minute and is applauded. Betsy acknowledges the congratulations and sycophancy which are her due. Foot- men come through the room with trays of ices. 
Anna is still at the window, unaware that there is only darkness outside. In the room, Betsy notes the oddity: Anna alone with her back to the room. 
REVERSE ON ANNA 
Anna opens her eyes. She is lost for a moment, perplexed. 
vronsky (O.C.) May I have the honour of bringing you an ice? 
Anna turns, understanding nothing. 
VRONSKY (CONT'D) Ices are being served. 
ANNA I would prefer to try a cigarette. 
She sits down. Vronsky takes out a cigarette case. He lights her cigarette. She tries it and coughs. 
VRONSKY (IN FRENCH) Courage! 
Anna smiles. Puffs delicately once. 
ANNA Thank you. 
She gives the cigarette to him. 
ANNA (CONT'D) I'll try another one sometime. 
VRONSKY When? 
She looks at him in surprise. He dunks the cigarette in an abandoned dish of ice cream. 
VRONSKY (CONT'D) Where? 
ANNA Just as I was thinking your manners have improved since Moscow. You behaved badly, very badly. 
VRONSKY And who was responsible for that? 
Anna gets up and walks over to Betsy's chair. 
ANNA Give me a cup of tea. 
Betsy obediently gets up to fill a cup from the samovar. Vronsky follows Anna. This is watched by more than one guest. Betsy hands the cup to Anna. 
BETSY How nice--Alexei Aleksandrevich has arrived. 
Karenin enters smiling. Lisa Merkalova and Anna's Friend share a delicious-malicious moment. 
LISA MERKALOVA I'm not sure my nerves can stand another Alexei at this moment. 
As Betsy and Karenin move smilingly to greet each other, Karenin's radar picks up the two women's intimate laughter. 
Karenin remains at apparent ease, as though unaware of people's glances at Vronsky and Anna, and he kisses Betsy's hand. Princess Myagkaya has meanwhile gone over to Anna. Anna likes her and is glad of the diversion. 
PRINCESS MYAGKAYA So the Schuzburgs asked us to dinner. The sauce was said to have cost a thousand rou- bles, and it was ghastly. We had to ask them back. I gave them a sauce that cost eighty- five kopeks and it was a triumph. 
Anna and Vronsky laugh. Princess Myagkaya moves on. 
VRONSKY Were you glad to see me or not? 
ANNA This must stop. You make me feel as if I were guilty of something. 
VRONSKY What do you want me to do? 
ANNA I want you to go to Moscow and beg Kitty to forgive you. 
VRONSKY No, that's not what you want. Moscow? I can do better than that. Tonight I refused a posting to Tashkent. I can change my mind, and you'll never see me again. 
ANNA If you have any thought for me, you will give me back my peace. 
VRONSKY I have no peace to give. There can be no peace for us--only misery or the greatest happiness. You are my whole life now. 
She looks at him and nods slowly, as if in thought. 
Betsy diplomatically leads Karenin to Anna. 
BETSY Your husband is impossible!-- his opinions are all wrong but he talks so brilliantly he wins every argument. 
Anna looks up at her, hearing nothing. 
ANNA What? 
She notices Karenin, who kisses her hand. Vronsky acknowledges Karenin. 
KARENIN I called to take you home. 
ANNA No, I'm staying. Send the carriage back for me. 
KARENIN Of course. 
He bows to Betsy. Ignoring Vronsky, he turns away. 
LATER 
Vronsky is with one group of guests, Anna with another. She is animated, excited, at a small table, involved in a game of cards-- which she wins, to local applause. She speaks a "must go" to Betsy, and swiftly goes to the door. 
INT. ENTRANCE HALL, TVERSKOY HOUSE--NIGHT 
Vronsky opens his door to Anna. They don't speak. He takes her hand and brings her in. 
SEX AS BEFORE 
INT. VRONSKY'S APARTMENT, SAME TIME--DAY 
Vronsky leads Anna through the apartment to the bedroom. 
SEX AS BEFORE 
INT. VRONSKY'S BEDROOM, SAME TIME--DAY 
Vronsky takes off Anna's outer clothes, slowly and carefully, starting with her hat and veil. 
SEX AS BEFORE 
INT. VRONSKY'S BEDROOM, SAME TIME--DAY 
Anna, in underclothes, unbuttons Vronsky's shirt. 
SEX AS BEFORE 
INT. VRONSKY'S BEDROOM, SAME TIME--DAY 
Anna and Vronsky are standing kissing passionately. He has no shirt. 
SEX AS BEFORE 
INT. VRONSKY'S BEDROOM, SAME TIME--DAY 
Anna ends up half off the edge of Vronsky's bed, climaxing upside down and falling to the floor. Vronsky, also half off the bed, looks down at her. He reaches down for her. She grasps hold of his hand, huddled, hugs it to her, distressed to tears. 
ANNA Oh God forgive me. It's the end of everything--I've got nothing left now, only you. Remember that. 
VRONSKY Anna . . . Anna . . . how can I not remem- ber? You're my happiness. 
He draws her back on to the bed, kisses her face, her shoulder . . . 
ANNA Happiness! You murdered my happiness. 
She tries to leave but he attacks her as a lover, and she gives way, responding. 
ANNA (CONT'D) Murderer. Murderer. Go on. Go on. Go on. 
She starts hitting him. 
ANNA (CONT'D) Yes. Go on. Go on. Go on. 
EXT. SPRING MELT (POKROVSKOE)--DAY 
In sunshine, a large chunk of ice loses its purchase on winter and goes floating along a stream of tiny ice floes between grassy banks almost free of snow, with early aconites showing. 
EXT. POKROVSKOE--DAY 
The icy stream flows under a footbridge which has a broken handrail. Vasili, the steward, is on the bridge with a Carpenter. Levin, on horseback, is displeased. 
LEVIN I thought that had been done. 
VASILI I gave the order. What can you do with these people? 
Levin rides on, into an expanded prospect of fields and woods, snow on the ground. 
LATER 
When Levin gets in view of the house, he is puzzled by the distant sight of a three-horse sledge arriving. 
INT. DINING ROOM, POKROVSKOE--DAY 
The new arrival is Oblonsky, enjoying his food. 
OBLONSKY Ah--potage aux choux a la Russe! 
Agafia comes in with the roast fowl. 
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) Agafia!--if you opened up in Moscow, l'Angleterre would go out of business. 
Do you want news of Moscow? 
LEVIN Of Babylon? No. 
OBLONSKY You're right, what do you care? You love the country--you've got it. You love agricultur- ing, and, Lord knows, you've got it. You love shooting--you've got it. You've got every- thing you want! 
Agafia, leaving, throws Levin a look (no wife). 
LEVIN All right, go on, then. Have you stopped stealing bread rolls? 
OBLONSKY Ballet girl, oriental type. How can I help it? 
LEVIN So, nothing new to tell me. How is--how are the Shcherbatskys? 
OBLONSKY You mean Kitty. 
LEVIN I . . . Is she engaged now? 
OBLONSKY No. Vronsky went back to St. Petersburg. 
He waits for this to sink in. 
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) Kitty will be at Ergoshovo visiting Dolly in the summer. You could . . . 
LEVIN Oh yes, as if I had time in the summer! And I've got extra land this year at Kashin for the haymaking. 
ANNA And you love me? 
VRONSKY Yes. 
ANNA How much? 
VRONSKY This much. 
Anna drags the front of her skirts out of her way. 
ANNA This much? 
VRONSKY Yes. 
ANNA This much? 
VRONSKY Yes. 
ANNA This much? 
VRONSKY Yes. 
ANNA This much? And this much? And this much? 
VRONSKY Yes. 
ANNA ( FIERCELY) And . . . this . . . much . . . ? 
She falls on him. He strokes her hair. 
Her hand comes into view, the index finger bloody. She carefully paints his lips with it. She kisses his lips clean, and rolls off him onto her back. 
ANNA (CONT'D) So this is love. This. 
INT. KARENIN'S STUDY, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY 
SUMMER 
Korney brings Countess Lydia. Karenin comes from behind his desk to invite her to a chair. 
KARENIN Countess . . . I thought you would be at Peterhof now. 
LYDIA I've come from there. I'm distressed that you haven't taken your usual house this year. 
KARENIN Anna wanted a change. She is spending the summer at Tsarskoe. 
LYDIA Near Princess Betsy. And . . . 
Karenin waits. 
LYDIA (CONT'D) The Guards are in summer camp at Tsarskoe. 
Karenin waits. 
LYDIA (CONT'D) Alexei Alexandrovich, forgive me but you are too tolerant! Your wife . . . 
Karenin affects surprise. 
KARENIN Oh, is this about my wife? 
He smiles at her. 
KARENIN (CONT'D) My wife is beyond reproach. She is, after all, my wife. 
Countess Lydia gets the message. She rises to go. Karenin kisses her hand and accompanies her to the door. She leaves him, and his social mask gives way to his disturbance. 
INT. DEMIN'S HOUSE, TSARSKOE--NIGHT 
The Commanding Officer is throwing a party for his officers: serious drink- ing, Soldier Servants, a crowded table on the large verandah, Soldier Sing- ers in white linen tunics performing operetta and folk songs. Vronsky, in party spirit, is with Petritsky and another friend, Yashvin, singing along. 
An officer we don't know is, surprisingly, hailed as "Vronsky!"--he's Vronsky's elder brother, Alexander. He gestures "Later!" and goes to Vron- sky. The brothers embrace. 
ALEXANDER Alyosha . . . a message from Maman. Her friend Princess Sorokina has a house here, and a virgin daughter, that's not part of the 
message, but they'll all be at the races and you're expected to supper afterwards. 
The song ends and Demin, half drunk, climbs on the table, shouts for silence and a toast. 
DEMIN Gentlemen--I give you--the regiment! 
General uproar. "The regiment." 
EXT. DEMIN'S GARDEN, TSARSKOE--NIGHT 
On a garden bench where the noise of the party is quieter, Vronsky and Alexander talk. 
ALEXANDER I heard you turned down a promotion. 
VRONSKY That was Maman interfering. 
ALEXANDER Yes. And now she's come up with a princess for you. (SERIOUSLY) Alexei--we're brothers, so don't take offence. Getting married puts the pack on your back--it leaves your hands free for climbing the ladder. Getting serious about a married woman is like carrying your pack in your arms. 
VRONSKY So they talk about me. I'm leaving, Sasha. 
ALEXANDER An assignation? 
VRONSKY Come on, I'll introduce you. 
EXT. STABLES, TSARSKOE--NIGHT 
Vronsky with Alexander beside him clucks his tongue at the black opening of a stable and calls softly for Frou-Frou. There's a stir within and the mare's head appears. Vronsky opens the door. 
ANNA Yes, and I'm only going to die having your baby. 
VRONSKY That's all nonsense! 
She kisses him all over his face. 
ANNA Tell me it is, tell me it is. You love me. Only me. 
VRONSKY Your note said your husband would be out. 
ANNA He was late. Serves him right. And you. Why do you call him my husband? He isn't my husband--he's a clock, a wooden doll-- 
VRONSKY But it was awkward . . . a matter of your honour. You made an agreement. 
Anna flares up again. 
ANNA Do you think of my honour when you're sharing whores with your Hindoo! 
VRONSKY Your demon again! 
ANNA I'll be glad to die, before you start to hate me! 
VRONSKY Anna . . . 
Anna gives a gasp. She laughs. 
ANNA Put your hand there. There! Did you feel him move! 
INT. COMMITTEE CHAMBER, ST. PETERSBURG--NIGHT 
"The Committee" is in session. Stremov has the floor. He is referring to a map of Russia on an easel, splotched with colours. Karenin is there but not listening, his thoughts far away. 
STREMOV I must respectfully ask Minister Karenin whether his proposals for the regulation of these colourful Gypsy tribes, of these schol- arly God-fearing Jews, and of--but I'm afraid I have lost the Minister's attention . . . 
All turn to look at Karenin, who sits staring at nothing, unaware even of the pause. He wakes. For a beat he hardly knows where he is. 
INT. ENTRANCE HALL, KARENIN HOUSE--NIGHT 
Kapitonich lets Karenin in. Karenin is brisk. 
KARENIN Who is here? 
KAPITONICH Only Madame, Your Excellency. 
Karenin goes up the staircase. There is an urgency in him, a fury. 
INT. ANNA'S BOUDOIR, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--NIGHT 
Karenin walks in and goes to her bureau, empties out little drawers and receptacles, looking for the key to the main drawer. Anna comes in from the bedroom, alarmed, in her nightdress. 
ANNA I wanted to see him because . . . 
KARENIN I do not wish to be told why a woman wants to see her lover. 
He pulls furiously at the locked drawer, then looks around for an implement. 
ANNA What are you . . . ? 
KARENIN I want his letters. 
Karenin finds an iron bootjack. Anna tries to stop him. He pushes her aside and smashes the wood around the lock, then, struggling against her, he takes from the open drawer a pretty cardboard box, a good guess. He confirms that it contains letters. 
KARENIN (CONT'D) I am going to Moscow tomorrow, and then to the provinces with a commission to investigate conditions among the Jews and Gypsies--whose conditions I infinitely prefer to my own. I will not return to this house until divorce has put you into the street. Meanwhile my son will be sent to live with my eldest sister. 
ANNA (WAILS) Alexei . . . please . . . leave me Serozha . . . ! 
Karenin looks at her with contempt. 
KARENIN Do you think I would let you have my son? You are depraved, a woman without honour. I thank God the curse of love is lifted from me. 
He walks out with the box of letters. 
EXT. STREET, MOSCOW--DAY 
WINTER AGAIN 
Oblonsky arrives outside his office building in a cab. He enters. 
INT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING, MOSCOW--DAY 
Saluted by the Hall Porter, Oblonsky mounts a semi-grand staircase and arrives at the entrance to his department. He goes in. 
INT. OUTER ROOM, OBLONSKY'S OFFICE, SAME TIME--DAY 
Levin stands up in his almost new, hardly used coat, top hat and boots. 
OBLONSKY Levin! What . . . ? 
Levin smiles, hopefully, sheepish. 
LEVIN I need your advice . . . 
It's a reprise. Oblonsky understands. He seizes Levin and kisses him. 
INT. RECEPTION ROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE--NIGHT 
A small group. Dolly is playing the piano. Kitty turns the pages for Dolly. The old Prince Shcherbatsky and the Princess are with Countess Nordston and Oblonsky. 
COUNTESS NORDSTON Well, is he coming? 
Kitty, keeping half an eye on the door, sees Levin enter and misses the page- turn. Oblonsky goes to greet Levin. 
LEVIN How can she? I mean, look at me! Suppose she's only marrying me to get married? Suppose she's still in love with Vronsky? 
She's making a terrible mistake! I'll go to her and tell her she's free, that's what I must do . . . 
MATVEY Your coat, sir. 
Levin snatches the coat and puts it on, and dashes out of the room. 
INT. ENTRANCE HALL, SHCHERBATSKY HOUSE-- DAY 
Levin, in disarray, is let into the house. The entrance hall is crowded, loud and chaotic with children, maids, governesses and Kitty's mother. Tanya, Masha and Lili are bridesmaids. Grisha is a page. Princess Shcherbatsky, trying to create order among last-minute bouquet distribution, hair- adjustments, shoe-changing, etc., sees Levin and explodes. 
PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY Konstantin!--what-- ? 
LEVIN I have to talk to Kitty. 
PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY You're not allowed to see her! 
Levin gallops up the stairs. 
INT. KITTY'S ROOM, SHCHERBATSKY HOUSE--DAY 
Kitty, dressed for the church, is whispering into the crack of the bedroom door. 
KITTY No. I don't understand at all! What's the matter with you? 
INT. OUTSIDE KITTY'S ROOM, SAME TIME--DAY 
LEVIN You can't love me. Think it over! Let people say what they like! 
KITTY ( FRIGHTENED) Are you mad? Have you changed your mind? 
LEVIN Yes. If you don't love me. 
KITTY But I do love you! 
Levin hesitates, desperate. 
LEVIN Do you? Well, I love you! 
KITTY Oh, Konstantin! 
They link hands through the opening, each with a hand to kiss. 
OVER-- CHURCH ORGAN MUSIC 
INT. CHURCH--DAY 
A mere fragment of a long and ornate marriage ceremony . . . 
The grizzled Priest lights two decorated candles, holding them askew in his left hand, and he uses his right hand to touch Levin and, more tenderly, Kitty. He gives the couple the candles, Kitty taking hers in her gloved hand. Levin looks blissfully at Kitty. 
MIX TO 
The Priest lifts crowns from their heads, and invites them to kiss each other, relieving them of their candles. 
The Choir bursts with pride. 
INT. NURSERY, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY 
The baby girl, two months old, is being fed by a Wet Nurse. Replete, the baby is given over to the Nursemaid who lays the child in her crib. 
Karenin watches all this. The women ignore him: they are used to him now, and Karenin is harmless. Karenin stares fascinated at the baby, who stares back. 
INT. BOUDOIR, KARENIN HOUSE, ST. PETERSBURG-- DAY 
Anna stares at herself in the mirror. The act of raising a pair of scissors is an effort. She isolates a thick lock of her hair, and snips it off. 
INT. BEDROOM, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY 
Anna's hair is short all over. She sits up in bed, listening to Princess Betsy, who has brought the current gossip. 
BETSY . . . and there was her husband wearing her best ballgown, rouge all over his face . . . ma chere, le scandale! . . . But I'd better tell you some regimental news . . . 
INT. ENTRANCE HALL, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY 
Karenin enters and sees a glamorous Footman standing in the entrance hall, holding a white fur cape. 
KARENIN Who is here? 
FOOTMAN Princess Elisabeth Federovna Tverskaya, Your Excellency. 
INT. BEDROOM LEVEL, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY 
Karenin approaches the bedroom door. 
anna (O.C.) No--I don't want to see him. 
betsy (O.C.) . . . but your husband surely wouldn't . . . 
INT. BEDROOM, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY 
Anna sees Karenin who is about to retreat. 
KARENIN Please excuse me. 
ANNA No--stay. 
BETSY I am so glad to see you. Everyone asks after you. 
Karenin bows to her and kisses Anna's hand. 
A respectful cough at the door reveals an obsequious male Shopkeeper. Kar- enin is bewildered. 
KARENIN Madame Odette . . . ? 
SHOPKEEPER Excuse the liberty, Your Excellency . . . it's for a bonnet and some ribbons Her Excel- lency has overlooked. If you wish us to address ourselves to Her Excellency, please be so good as to tell us where we might . . . 
Karenin is stricken into immobility, his face hiding in one propped-up hand. A tear falls on the blotter. Slyudin rescues him, ushering the Shopkeeper out. 
Countess Lydia arrives in full fluttering cry. 
LYDIA I have forced my way in! I have heard! 
KARENIN Countess, every shopkeeper has heard. 
LYDIA My dear friend! Don't give way to sorrow. Our Lord Jesus Christ has you in his care. 
KARENIN No, I'm done for. I don't understand any- thing. All day long I'm being asked to make decisions about bills and servants, the kitchen, Serozha's clothes . . . 
LYDIA I understand. I understand everything. I am going to act. The household arrangements you can leave to me. I will come every day. I will be a second mother to Serozha. 
He clasps both her hands and kisses them. Lydia falls to her knees. 
LYDIA (CONT'D) He that humbleth himself shall be exalted! You must not thank me. Thank Him whose love pours through me! 
EXT. SNOWY COUNTRYSIDE, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--DAY 
The sleigh brings Levin and Kitty home through deep snow all around. The house comes into view. 
SLEIGH 
They have been on honeymoon travels, attested by hotel labels on the lug- gage. Kitty, eager and anxious, looks at the approaching house. Not too bad. Levin takes her hand. She smiles at him, to calm him. 
EXT. THE HOUSE, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--DAY 
Agafia and Vasili come out on the porch. The house has been painted, the window frames smartened up, and paper flowers are tied to the posts of the porch. The sleigh pulls up. Levin carries Kitty through the snow to the porch. Agafia bobs. Vasili bows. 
LEVIN This is Agafia, and Vasili, the steward . . . My wife, Ekaterina Alexandrovna Levin. 
KITTY I am very pleased to meet you both. 
Kuzma sidles by with a bow and goes to take the luggage from the sleigh. 
LEVIN And that was Kuzma. Come inside! 
VASILI Careful--door's still a bit . . . (to Levin's look) it's all right, it'll be dry tomorrow . . . 
INT. SITTING ROOM, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME-- DAY 
Levin shows Kitty in. He is immensely relieved. It never looked better. At the same time he realises that Agafia is agitated: a word in private. 
LEVIN Is it all right? 
Kitty nods, smiles gamely--it's not like home. 
LEVIN (CONT'D) Sit down a minute. 
KITTY No--I want to see everything. 
Agafia panics. 
LEVIN A moment. 
Levin follows Agafia out. 
INT. STAIRS, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--DAY 
Agafia follows Levin up the stairs. She is outraged. 
AGAFIA . . . and now I'm doing kitchen maid's work because Nadya's parents won't let her set foot in this house, and who can blame them!--it's indecent! 
INT. GUEST BEDROOM, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME-- DAY 
Levin enters the small bedroom. Agafia waits outside. 
Nikolai is in the bed-- wasted, near death. He lies in squalor. Masha is wiping his face. She stands up at Levin's approach. Levin bends over Niko- lai, presses his gaunt hand. Nikolai opens his eyes. 
LEVIN It's me, Konstantin. 
NIKOLAI Yes, good. The doctor here is useless--get me a doctor from Moscow. 
LEVIN Where did you go? I asked for you every- where, when I was getting married. 
Nikolai sighs and closes his eyes. Levin retreats, looks to Masha. 
MASHA (WHISPERS) I'm sorry . . . I couldn't leave him. I know I've done wrong. 
LEVIN Yes. My wife . . . You can't stay now. 
Levin goes outside to Agafia and closes the door. 
INT. OUTSIDE GUEST BEDROOM, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME-- DAY 
AGAFIA I couldn't go against Nikolai Dmitrich's orders . . . 
LEVIN Yes--yes . . . She's going. 
An unwelcome thought strikes Levin. 
LEVIN (CONT'D) Did the doctor see her? 
Agafia nods guiltily. 
LYDIA My friend . . . you would be blowing on the embers of a fire which must be allowed to die . . . Let me write to her. 
EXT. TOY SHOP, ST. PETERSBURG--DAY 
Anna is looking into the display window of a toy shop. She is excited, glow- ing. She enters the shop. 
INT. VRONSKY'S FLAT, ST. PETERSBURG--DAY 
Returning from the toy shop with a wrapped parcel, Anna comes in. Luggage is stacked up in the hallway and Franz is unpacking stuff in the main room. 
She sees that a hand-delivered letter is waiting for her. She opens it. Anna reads the letter. For a moment she is devastated by it--but then, furious, she tears it up. 
EXT. KARENIN HOUSE, ST. PETERSBURG--DAY 
It's very early morning. The street is not awake. A hired cab brings Anna to her former home. She is heavily veiled, and carries the wrapped parcel from the toy shop. The cab is to wait for her. She rings the doorbell. 
A sleepy Servant opens the big wooden door. 
ANNA I'm here to see Sergei Alexeyich. 
The young Servant doesn't know her. Anna steps past him, pushing money into his hand. 
INT. ENTRANCE HALL, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY 
Kapitonich, pulling on his livery greatcoat, comes to the inner glass door and lets Anna in. He does not recognise her. 
ANNA I have brought something for Sergei Alexeyich. 
Kapitonich scrutinises her, prepared to forestall her. 
KAPITONICH He is not up yet. Would you wish to wait? Who shall I say . . . ? 
Kapitonich peers at her and realises who she is. He steps back and bows. 
KAPITONICH (CONT'D) Please come in, Your Excellency. 
Anna goes quickly to the stairs. 
KAPITONICH (CONT'D) Allow me to announce you. The tutor may be there and not dressed. 
Anna shakes her head and is almost running away from him. Kapitonich gives chase. 
INT. STAIRS, KARENIN'S HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY 
KAPITONICH Please allow me! 
INT. UPPER LEVEL, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME-- DAY 
Anna dashes past two Housemaids who gape at her, and disappears round the corner. She's a little mad now. 
INT. UPPER STAIRS, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME-- DAY 
Anna, wild-eyed, climbs the stairs and meets the tutor, Vasily Lukich, coming down, buttoning his waistcoat. Lukich is startled, not knowing her. 
ANNA I've come to see Sergei Alexeyich. 
Kapitonich reaches these stairs, calling, "Your Excellency . . . !" 
INT. TOP FLOOR, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME-- DAY 
Anna dashes for Serozha's door and flings herself through it. 
INT. "SEROZHA'S ROOM," KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY 
It's no longer Serozha's room. A large Woman sits up in bed. She's probably the Cook. She cries out. Anna reels back. She looks panicked. 
Kapitonich catches up, out of breath. 
KAPITONICH He's been moved to the small sitting room. 
INT. UPPER STAIRS, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME-- DAY 
At the bottom of the Upper Stairs, Lukich, the Housemaids and a couple of half-dressed Footmen have their heads together. They move aside as Anna hurries by, seeing nothing. 
INT. UPPER LEVEL, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME-- DAY 
Kapitonich catches up with Anna at the door of the "small sitting room." 
KAPITONICH I'll just look in. 
Anna shakes her head and walks past him, into the room. 
INT. BEDROOM, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY 
The curtains are drawn closed. The room is dim. Anna sees Serozha sitting up, yawning, his eyes closed, and falling back on the pillow. She comes to the bed and whispers his name. Serozha raises himself on his elbow, opens his eyes and smiles dreamily and falls forward into her arms. 
SEROZHA Mama. 
ANNA Oh, my dear little boy. 
SEROZHA I knew you would come. Today is my birthday. 
Serozha rubs his face on her neck, falls back on the pillow, only half awake and going back to sleep. Anna looks at him avidly, touching his forearms, his shoulders, the hair over his ears. She can't stop her own tears. He comes awake. 
SEROZHA (CONT'D) Are you crying? 
ANNA I won't cry. It's time for you to get dressed. And I almost forgot your present, look . . . open it . . . 
Serozha takes off her hat. 
SEROZHA You don't want that . . . Let me see. 
ANNA I would love to be there if I could get a box. 
YASHVIN (BOWS) Madame, your box is number four! You'll find me there with Princess Myagkaya. Will you come, Vronsky? 
Vronsky shakes his head. Yashvin kisses Anna's hand. 
ANNA I see why . . . Alexei is so fond of you. 
Yashvin laughs and bows himself out. 
VRONSKY You know you can't go to the theatre? 
ANNA Annushka! 
VRONSKY For heaven's sake-- 
Annushka comes. 
ANNA A bath. I'll come in and choose a dress. 
Annushka goes. 
VRONSKY Anna--I implore you--don't you know . . . ? 
ANNA I'm not ashamed of who I am or what I've done: are you ashamed for me? Why do you keep a room at the hotel? Aren't we together? Have you changed towards me? 
VRONSKY It's because I love you and care about you. 
ANNA If that's the case, I don't know why you aren't coming with me. 
VRONSKY That would make it worse. 
ANNA You're afraid. Well, I'm not. 
INT. OPERA HOUSE, ST. PETERSBURG--NIGHT 
Before the performance, the stairs, galleries and corridors, giving access to the stalls and boxes, are crowded with the town's highest society. And Anna, at her most beautiful, is magically cleaving through it. Awareness of her presence is like a contagion, and yet everyone manages not to catch her eye . . . so while all around her there are people impeding each other with greetings, Anna's path opens before her. 
She knows what is happening. It shocks her but her eyes barely show it. The spell is broken by Princess Myagkaya (she of the 85 kopek sauce) who hails her. 
PRINCESS MYAGKAYA Anna . . . ! 
She picks up on the surrounding effect of this, and rubs it in with mischief, taking Anna's arm. 
princess myagkaya (cont'd) Something has done you good--you look wonderful. 
INT. VRONSKY'S FLAT, ST PETERSBURG--NIGHT 
Vronsky sits and broods. Angrily, he changes his mind. He jumps up call- ing for Franz. 
EXT. OPERA HOUSE, ST. PETERSBURG--NIGHT 
Vronsky's cab draws up outside the brightly lit, deserted opera house. He alights. 
INT. STAIRS, GALLERY, OPERA HOUSE--NIGHT 
Vronsky comes up the stairs. The place is deserted, apart from Atten- dants . . . one of whom takes Vronsky's cloak and gives him a token. 
INT. ANNA'S BOX, OPERA HOUSE, SAME TIME-- NIGHT 
On stage, Act One is just ending, and the curtain falls. The applause gives way to chatter. 
PRINCESS MYAGKAYA Should we visit or stay put? 
Anna sees Vronsky entering on the side-aisle below. He looks up at the boxes, seeking her. She turns away. 
ANNA Stay put. 
Princess Myagkaya has engaged the attention of Stremov in the neighbour- ing box. 
PRINCESS MYAGKAYA Minister! Congratulations. Come in for a moment. 
But Stremov only bows coldly and turns away. Yashvin notes this and begins to chew his moustache anxiously. Anna's neighbour on the other side, a meek husband of a battle-axe, admires her openly. 
Anna sees that Vronsky has stopped to talk to Countess Vronsky and the Princesses Sorokina. The young Princess seems animated by Vronsky, who bows himself away. 
Princess Myagkaya sees where Anna is looking. 
princess myagkaya (cont'd) Princess Sorokina and her daughter, they're from Moscow, neighbours of Countess Vron- sky, quite well off, no sons, she's a widow. 
Anna gives her a smiling but wounded look. 
princess myagkaya (cont'd) My dear, I'm a sales catalogue. 
INT. OPERA HOUSE, SAME TIME--NIGHT 
Vronsky meets Alexander in the aisle and greets him. 
VRONSKY You'll come up to see us afterwards . . . ? 
ALEXANDER Talk to Varya. 
Alexander indicates his seat to Vronsky. Vronsky sits by Varya. 
VRONSKY Will you call on Anna? 
VARYA Oh, Alexei . . . I'm fond of you . . . but . . . 
VRONSKY For God's sake, Anna isn't a criminal! 
VARYA I'd call on her if she'd only broken the law. But she broke the rules. 
VRONSKY I know how to make you sleep. 
LATER--IN BED 
Vronsky makes love to Anna but it's not working for her. Her eyes stray around. By the bed is a carafe of water, an empty glass and a pharmacy bottle as dark as ink, with a handwritten label. 
EXT. MOSCOW--DAY 
High summer. Heat and dust. 
INT. TEA SHOP, MOSCOW--DAY 
Anna, with some dainty shopping by her, is taking tea in a genteel cafe. Her eye is caught by a mother and son at another table. The boy is a "Serozha." Anna misses her son acutely in that moment. 
Then Dolly enters the tea shop. Anna's heart lifts for a moment and she is about to greet her, but then realises that Dolly is one of a trio of "society ladies," and Anna lowers her head. When she sneaks a look, she catches one of the ladies whispering to the others. Anna realises that she has been recognised by a stranger, and is notorious. She "hides" in her purse, finding money to leave on the table so that she can escape. A sound makes her look up and she sees that Dolly has sat down opposite her. 
DOLLY Anna . . . I am very glad to see you. Are you well? How is your little one? 
Anna nods, words won't come. 
DOLLY (CONT'D) Stiva wanted to invite you and Count Vron- sky to the house but it's impossible . . . 
ANNA I understand. 
DOLLY No, no--you don't. Kitty and her husband are with us. She's in Moscow to have the baby. 
ANNA Kitty . . . ? Oh, tell her how pleased I am . . . ! 
DOLLY Perhaps I'll wait a year or two. (she gulps a laugh) Oh . . . love! 
ANNA Yes . . . love! Don't you disapprove of me for what I've done? 
DOLLY No. I wish I'd done the same. But no one asked me! Well . . . I wouldn't have been brave enough. (she blinks tears) Stiva, you know . . . he doesn't change . . . like all men, I suppose. 
She doesn't notice her tactlessness but it lands on Anna, who manages a smile. 
EXT. GRAND HOTEL, MOSCOW--NIGHT 
INT. HOTEL SUITE, MOSCOW--NIGHT 
Anna, in a nightdress, is awake in the night, staring out of the grand window of a grand hotel, smoking. 
INT. HOTEL BEDROOM, SAME TIME--NIGHT 
Anna comes back to bed. Vronsky is asleep. She unstops a pharmacy bottle (a different one) and pours a draught mixed with water. 
INT. BEDROOM, MOSCOW HOTEL--DAY 
Anna sleeps alone in the bed. Annushka, after a tap on the door, comes in cautiously, worried. 
ANNUSHKA Madame . . . Madame . . . 
Anna sits up. 
ANNUSHKA (CONT'D) Are you ill? 
ANNA What time is it? Is Anya up? 
ANNUSHKA It's afternoon, Madame. 
ANNA I'm all right. It's all right. (PAUSE) Get them to bring up all our trunks and travel cases. We've been here long enough. 
INT. HOTEL SUITE, MOSCOW--DAY 
Vronsky comes in, noting the empty trunks and cases stacked up. Anna comes from her room to greet him. She is making an effort to be pleasant, but she looks excited, febrile. 
ANNA I had an inspiration. Why do we have to wait here? Why can't we wait in the coun- try? I don't want to hear any more about a divorce, or think about it. 
VRONSKY Good! I'm bored here. When should we go? 
ANNA If I bore you here, I'll bore you in the country. 
VRONSKY I didn't say you bore me. Moscow bores me. When should we go? . . . Tomorrow? 
But Anna's mood has turned. 
ANNA I can't be ready by tomorrow. 
VRONSKY The day after, then. 
ANNA If you like. 
VRONSKY No, wait. That's Sunday. I have to see Maman. 
ANNA That's twenty minutes away in the train-- you could go to see her tomorrow--or was it that you wanted to spend Sunday with Princess Sorokina? 
VRONSKY Please don't spoil everything. I can't see Maman tomorrow because she won't have read the papers she has to sign. Oh, and then there's the bank . . . But we can leave on Tuesday. 
ANNA In that case, let's not bother. I'll leave on Sunday or not at all. 
VRONSKY That's absurd! 
ANNA It's absurd to you because you have no understanding for my life here. 
VRONSKY Anna . . . Anna . . . 
ANNA You've stopped loving me. You've given up everything for me, and it's turned you against me. Why lie about it? 
VRONSKY Stop. I put off our departure for a day or two, and you tell me I don't love you. 
ANNA Because I've been living off your love and there's none left, so this is over! Finished. 
ANNA When Count Vronsky comes back, tell him . . . I don't want to be disturbed. 
INT. BEDROOM, HOTEL SUITE--NIGHT 
Anna is listening for Vronsky's return. She hears him come in. She hears him approach. Then she hears Annushka's voice, then Vronsky's voice. She waits in suspense, disappointed as Vronsky's steps retreat. 
INT. STUDY, HOTEL SUITE--NIGHT 
Anna, holding a candle-lamp, finds Vronsky asleep on the couch. She hesi- tates, but turns away. 
INT. BEDROOM, HOTEL SUITE--DAY 
Anna wakes. She re-collects herself. She looks at the bedside clock. In a sud- den hurry she leaves the bed and the bedroom. 
INT. OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM, HOTEL SUITE, SAME TIME--DAY 
Anna finds Annushka waiting. 
ANNA Count Vronsky . . . ? 
ANNUSHKA He went out early, to the stables, he said. 
Anna collapses on a chair and weeps. 
ANNA Oh, Annushka . . . I should have died. Do you remember? 
ANNUSHKA Don't take it to heart, Anna Arkadyeva . . . 
ANNA I've made him hate me. 
INT. CLOSE (HOTEL)--DAY 
Anna's hand writes in a hurry: "I'm to blame. Come home. I'm frightened." 
INT. HOTEL SUITE, SAME TIME--DAY 
Anna seals the note and gives it to Annushka. 
ANNA Tell Michael to hurry. 
Annushka runs out with the note. 
INT. HOTEL SUITE--DAY 
Anna is keeping watch at the window . . . and is rewarded by the return- ing coach. She hurries out. 
INT. STAIRS, HOTEL--DAY 
Anna looks down into the entrance hall. Michael, the Coachman, comes in and comes up the stairs to her. She sees that he is holding her note. 
MICHAEL Count Vronsky had already left, Your Excel- lency. He took a cab to the station . . . to the Countess. 
INT. LOCAL TRAIN--DAY 
Anna clutches her red bag to her, sitting among passengers. 
Anna looks about her. Across the carriage she sees through the window that her train is overtaking another passenger train on the next line. 
She looks at the windows of the other train "going by" . . . seeing the pas- sengers inside. 
Unexpectedly, she seems to see a Man who might be Vronsky sitting opposite a laughing Woman who might be Princess Sorokina. 
Anna's body jerks involuntarily. She half rises. The image, however, is brief and is borne away, as her own train goes by, accelerating. The win- dows opposite pick up speed as she leaves them behind-- 
And then she has the same illusion again-- a "Vronsky" and a "Sorokina" glimpsed in the other train and snatched away in the instant. 
Now she stands up and goes to the opposite window, where the windows of the other train are flashing by in the (anachronistic) manner of pro- jected film-frames, and she sees "Vronskys" and "Sorokinas" flashing by at gathering speed. And then the train has gone and there's nothing going by but the view. 
Anna collapses into the nearest seat. 
EXT. LOCAL STATION, SAME TIME--DAY 
The train arrives at a small station. 
Anna steps down from the train. The platform is well populated by people waiting to board the train or to meet the arriving passengers. There is an energy about the people-- shouting, laughter, movement. Porters shout for custom. A couple of Young Men seem to be laughing rudely directly at her, but they pass by, ignoring her. 
Anna pauses, bewildered, lost, not knowing what to do next. 
She sees the Sorokina Coachman on the platform, recognising his distinctive livery, a cockade in his hat. 
ANNA Are you waiting for the Princess Sorokina? 
COACHMAN No, Your Excellency, both princesses are at the house of Countess Vronsky. I'm waiting FOR HIM-- 
Anna turns back, agitated, expecting Vronsky to appear, but what comes is a Footman carrying three hatboxes and a large box from a dress shop. 
Anna walks away, along the platform, impeded by people going by her, aware that some are staring at her as she passes. A Boy selling drinks grins at her. A little group of Ladies and Children meeting a bespectacled man off the train are laughing and chattering but fall silent and look at her. She increases her pace. She hurries away towards the far end of the platform. Beyond her, a goods train is slowly approaching. Between her and the train, two Maidservants are walking towards her. They turn their heads to look at her, remarking on her dress. 
MAIDSERVANT Look at that lace on her . . . 
There is a rough bench near the end of the platform. Anna reaches it and sits down. The two girls turn again to look back at her, and are struck by the sight of Anna sitting alone in profile. The goods train reaches her and the first wagon goes past her. The two girls stop and watch, vaguely puzzled by her. 
As they watch, the beautiful woman on the bench gets up and walks the few steps to the edge of the wooden platform and into the path of the train, disappearing from view between the wheels of one of the wagons. 
EXT. (POKROVSKOE)--DAY 
CLOSE--A SCYTHE CUTS A SWATHE THROUGH STANDING HAY. 
EXT. RAILS--THE RED HANDBAG 
--lying separate against a rail, is clipped by a rolling train-wheel and knocked aside, spilling its contents . . .

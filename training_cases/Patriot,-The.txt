THE PATRIOT 
by 
Robert Rodat 
October 9, 1998 
FADE IN: 
CREDITS OVER: 
EXT.  SOUTH CAROLINA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 
Woodlands.  Beautiful.  Untamed.  Soaring old-growth elms arch over riverside maples along the shores of the gently curving, deep-water Santee River. 
SUPERIMPOSITION: 
SOUTH CAROLINA April, 1776 
Upstream, the swamps.  Beautiful.  Hundreds of BIRDS SING. Shafts of sunlight pierce the canopy, cutting through the hanging moss and kudzu, falling onto soft, swaying ferns covering the high ground. 
The water is clear, with fields of floating lily pads, each with a stark white flower rising from it. 
SUPERIMPOSITION: 
THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY 
EXT.  POND BLUFF - DAY 
A farm built between the banks of the river and the deep green of the swamps.  Good, fertile land, hacked out of the wilderness. 
The perfectly tended fields are ripe with barley, hops, alfalfa and tobacco.  Two sturdy brothers, NATHAN, 13 and SAMUEL, 12, work one of the fields, rhythmically swinging scythes through the barley. 
The house, built of native brick, is well-constructed and well-maintained.  There's a barn, a workshop and a forge. It is a home of substance rather than wealth.  On the front porch, MARGARET, 11, pumps a butter churn while her brother, WILLIAM, 6, watches. 
GABRIEL, 18, strong and handsome, walks out of the woods with a musket in his hand and a dozen game-birds over his shoulder.  At his side walks THOMAS, 14, also carrying a musket. 
INT.  WORKSHOP - DAY 
A perfect colonial workshop, fastidiously arranged with every conceivable tool of the period.  A foot-powered lathe.  A drop-forge.  A lifting saw.  Racks of tools, planes, hammers, augers, drills, blocks, all hanging in their places.  All very well-worn. 
FRANCIS MARION methodically works his lathe, turning a piece of hardwood, shaving off tiny curls of wood with a razor-sharp chisel.  He's in his late-forties, strong and weathered.  His hands, though big and callused, handle the chisel with a surgeon's precision.  Self-educated and self-sufficient, he has built himself, as he built his farm, brick by brick, from the coarse clay of the earth. 
A finely-made rocking chair, missing only the dowel on which Marion is working, sits on the work table.  The chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web of perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue. 
Sitting on the woodpile, SUSAN, 4, a silent, stone-face wisp of a child, watches her father. 
Marion takes the piece of wood out of the lathe, carefully fits it into the chair, inserts a peg and taps it into place.  Then he steps back and appraises his handiwork. 
He picks up the chair and hooks the top rail to a scale, countering with a three-pound weight.  The chair floats. 
Marion blows softly on the weight which sinks.  Susan nods, so far, so good.  Marion puts the chair on the floor and walks slowly around it, checking every angle. 
Then, the acid test.  He takes a deep breath and lowers himself onto the seat, gingerly adding an ounce at a time. Not a creak.  He smiles and sits back with a sigh. 
CRACK!  THE CHAIR SPLINTERS under Marion's weight, DUMPING HIM on his ass on a pile of broken wood. 
MARION Damnation! 
He picks up some of the wood, about to fling it across the room but stops as Susan shoots him a disapproving look. He calms himself. 
MARION Sorry. 
Susan gets down from the woodpile and puts the remains of the chair in the fireplace.  As she climbs back up to her perch, Marion steps over to his wood rack, extracts a fresh dowel, fits it into the lathe and starts all over again. 
END CREDITS. 
EXT.  WORKSHOP - DUSK 
Marion leaves the workshop with Susan at his side.  Nathan and Samuel walk past, exhausted from their day in the field. 
NATHAN Father, I saw a post rider at the house. 
MARION Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field? 
SAMUEL We got it all cut and we bundled half of it. 
MARION Those swimming breaks cut into the day, don't they? 
Marion walks on without waiting for a reply from his contrite sons who jostle one another, trying to pass off the blame.  Gabriel and Thomas walk out of the barn. 
GABRIEL Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside. 
MARION Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk? 
THOMAS Better.  She's near ready to calve. 
Marion nods and motions for Susan to go with Gabriel and Thomas to the house.  She does so and Marion walks on alone toward: 
EXT.  HILLTOP - POND BLUFF - SUNSET 
The loveliest spot on the farm.  A beautiful view of the house, barns, river, fields and hills beyond.  A gravestone stands in the shade of a single apple tree.  It reads: 
ELIZABETH PUTNAM MARION   1738-1773 
Above her name is a carving of the night sky, at the center of which is the NORTH STAR, steady and guiding. 
Marion approaches.  He gives himself a moment to look at the grave, then he starts picking apples, speaking to the gravestone in a quiet voice that is more matter-of-fact than sorrowful. 
MARION ... and they bundled half... almost no trace of the boys you knew... 
A soft wind blows some dry leaves along the ground. Marion pauses as if listening to a spoken reply. 
MARION ... no, she still hasn't spoken... Margaret was her age when you... I remember the time at the river when we couldn't find Catherine... you couldn't stop crying... and she was asleep in the wagon the entire time... 
EXT.  BENNINGTON OVERLOOK - DAY 
The two carriages pass a view of their entire valley. Scattered farms with a patchwork of cultivated fields surrounding the town of Bennington. 
EXT.  SANTEE ROAD - DAY 
Passing through rolling farmland, the Marions head toward the coast.  They pass a large contingent of South Carolina Militia, drilling in a field.  The children, particularly Gabriel, watch avidly. 
EXT.  CHARLESTON - DAY 
A big, bustling city.  Marion and Gabriel negotiate the carriages through the busy streets.  The children watch, wide-eyed, seeing taverns, a public gallows, drunkards, street entertainers, well-dressed ladies attended by their maids, food venders, a man with a trained bear. 
EXT.  CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - CHARLESTON - DAY 
Grand.  Four stories.  Marion and his children pull up. CHARLOTTE MOTTE hurries out.  She's in her mid-thirties, beautiful, with a deep sadness that she keeps hidden as best she can. 
The children leap from the carriages and swarm around her, embracing her, smothering her with kisses. 
THE CHILDREN Aunt Charlotte!  Aunt Charlotte! 
CHARLOTTE Welcome!  Welcome!  Margaret, William, look at you...! (to Marion) They're huge.  What have you been feeding them? 
MARION They're from good stock on their mother's side. 
CHARLOTTE Thank you. 
Charlotte hustles the children toward the door. 
CHARLOTTE Come, come, inside, wait until you see what I have... 
THE CHILDREN (simultaneous) Presents!  For me?  What do you have? 
CHARLOTTE Inside, inside... 
Charlotte sweeps past Marion who smiles and follows her into the house. 
INT.  PARLOR - CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Marion watches as Charlotte finishes handing out presents. Susan plays with a new doll.  William has half-a-dozen new spinning tops, skimming around the floor.  Margaret holds a new dress up to herself.  Samuel, Nathan and Thomas tear into packages holding platoons of lead soldiers.  Gabriel looks through a new book. 
Charlotte sees Marion watching her, rises and joins him at the doorway. 
MARION You look well, Charlotte. 
CHARLOTTE As do you. 
Suddenly Thomas and Samuel race through the doorway, forcing Marion and Charlotte together, their bodies close. They step back and exchange warm but uneasy smiles. 
The moment is broken by the SOUND OF CHILDREN.  Marion and Charlotte gratefully turn their attention back to them. 
EXT.  CHARLESTON SQUARE - NIGHT 
Down the block from the Motte house.  A yelling crowd of Sons of Liberty is massed around a Liberty Tree from which hang dozens of glowing lanterns.  Most of the men in the crowd are drunk.  Vendors sell rum, ale, food and banners emblazoned with a coiled snake and the legend, "Don't Tread On Me."  Scores of on-lookers, including respectable people, as well as street urchins, whores and drunkards, watch the proceedings. 
Several Sons of Liberty string up effigies of King George III and Governor Wilmington.  They light the effigies on fire.  As they begin to blaze, the crowd cheers. 
EXT.  CHARLOTTE'S BALCONY - NIGHT 
Marion's children, except Gabriel, stand on the balcony watching the mob.  Marion steps out onto the balcony. 
MARION Inside, all of you... 
The children turn to Marion with stricken expressions. Marion relents. 
MARION Very well. 
The children turn back to the mob.  Marion joins them. 
THOMAS Look!  There's Gabriel! 
They see Gabriel making his way through the crowd.  He sees them and waves, then enters the house. 
A moment later Charlotte steps out onto the balcony and sees: 
IN THE SQUARE, a pair of drunk Sons of Liberty, pull down one of the smoldering effigies, cut off its head, then start hacking at it's groin with a sword. 
Appalled, Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion and snaps at the children. 
CHARLOTTE Children, inside!  All of you! Right now. 
The children start to protest, but a glance at Charlotte's resolute expression makes them think better of it.  They file into the house.  Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion and shoos the children inside.  Gabriel steps out and joins them. 
MARION What news? 
GABRIEL The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army. 
MARION Is that why the Assembly was convened? 
GABRIEL Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money. 
MARION And the Governor? 
GABRIEL He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body. 
MARION Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence. 
CHARLOTTE And send us to war alongside Massachusetts. 
MARION Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought. 
GABRIEL Lee is counting on your vote and expects you to be the first to enlist. 
Marion nods thoughtfully without revealing what he thinks of Lee's expectations.  Marion turns back to watch the mob. 
EXT.  ASSEMBLY HALL - CHARLESTON - DAY 
The capital building of South Carolina.  A large crowd of lower-class men and women is massed in front of the Assembly Hall.  As well-dressed Assemblymen walk into the building, the CROWD YELLS words of encouragement to some and berates others. 
LEE A long time ago... 
MARION Thirteen years... 
LEE That's a damn long time... 
The Speaker POUNDS HIS GAVEL again. 
SPEAKER Gentlemen!  Please! 
Marion and Lee ignore the speaker. 
MARION You were an Englishman then... 
LEE I was an American, I just didn't know it yet... 
The astonished Assemblymen and now even the Speaker watch the argument avidly, turning their heads in simultaneous anticipation of each rejoinder. 
MARION We don't have to go to war to gain independence... 
LEE Balderdash! 
MARION There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal... 
LEE Name five hundred. 
MARION Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery... 
LEE That's five, keep going... 
MARION ... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery... 
LEE You said bribery twice... 
Marion speaks slowly and firmly. 
MARION We do not have to go to war to gain independence. 
Lee says nothing for a moment, then he speaks more seriously, quietly, grimly. 
LEE Francis, I was at Bunker Hill.  It was as bad as anything you and I saw on the frontier.  Worse than the slaughter at the Ashuelot River. The British advanced three times and we killed over seven hundred of them at point blank range.  And still, they advanced and they took the ground.  That is the measure of their resolve.  If your principles dictate independence, then war is the only way.  It has come to that. 
Marion is silent for a long moment.  He softens, finds himself unsteady and speaks far more honestly than he ever wanted to. 
MARION I have seven children.  My wife is dead.  Who's to care for them if I go to war? 
Lee is stunned by Marion's honesty and his show of weakness.  At first Lee has no answer, then: 
LEE Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles. 
MARION That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead. 
LEE And your principles? 
MARION I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles. 
The other Assemblymen, both Patriots and Loyalists, stare at him, appalled.  Marion, feeling weak, sits down.  Lee looks at his friend with more sympathy than disappointment.  Then Lee turns to Robinson who addresses the chair. 
ROBINSON Mister Speaker, I call for a vote on a levy to the Continental Army. 
HAMILL Second. 
SPEAKER So moved. 
The vote is taken on a roll call.  Gabriel watches from the gallery. 
SPEAKER Mr. Robinson. 
ROBINSON Yea. 
SPEAKER Mr. Hamill. 
HAMILL Yea. 
SPEAKER Mr. Johnson. 
JOHNSON Yea. 
SPEAKER Mr. Simms. 
SIMMS Nay. 
SPEAKER Mr. Marion. 
No response. 
SPEAKER Mr. Marion. 
MARION Nay. 
In the gallery Gabriel turns and walks out.  The roll call continues.  Marion sits, eyes straight ahead. 
EXT.  ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY 
The crowd waits.  The doors open and a PAGE BOY dashes out and runs to the Continental Captain at the recruiting table. 
PAGE BOY Twenty-eight to twelve, the levy passed! 
The Continental Captain motions to an assembled squadron. They raise their muskets and FIRE A VOLLEY into the air. Other soldiers, STRIKE UP A MARTIAL AIR ON FIFES AND DRUMS.  Volunteers crowd around the recruiting table, YELLING and jostling for position. 
The delegates walk out.  Both Patriots and Loyalists give Marion a wide berth. 
Marion sees Gabriel, standing near the crowd at the recruiting table.  Marion walks up to him. 
GABRIEL Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle. 
MARION When you have children, I hope you'll understand. 
MARION No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here. 
Thomas appears at the doorway with a pair of muskets.  He gives one to Nathan and offers the other to his father. 
MARION Put those away. 
THOMAS But father, they might come this way. 
MARION Put them away. 
Reluctantly, Thomas takes the muskets back into the house. 
MARION Enough.  I'll be in the workshop. Samuel, the cows.  Thomas, attend to your studies here on the porch. Nathan, on the back porch.  If you see anyone, come get me.  Margaret, please keep William close to you. No one is to go past the yard wall. 
They all nod.  Marion walks off toward the workshop, followed by Susan.  The others hesitate. 
MARION Children. 
They head off to do as they were told. 
INT.  WORKSHOP - DAY 
Marion works the lathe.  Susan watches from her perch on the woodpile. 
EXT.  BARN - DAY 
The SOUND OF A CRASH from inside the barn.  An angry cow runs out of the barn, dragging a tenacious Samuel who is holding onto the cow's neck. 
Samuel's grip fails and he lands in the dirt.  The cow runs about thirty yards down the hill, stopping on the bank of the river.  Samuel grabs a rope and heads down the hill to get the cow. 
ON THE RIVERBANK 
As Samuel approaches the cow, he see it skittishly approaching then retreating from the water.  Then he sees the cause -- the water in the river has a pale, pink hue. Samuel stares at it, trying to figure out what it is. 
Behind him, Margaret sees her brother beyond the yard wall. 
MARGARET Samuel... 
He doesn't respond.  Margaret, trailed by William, walks down toward Samuel. 
MARGARET Samuel, get up to the house.  You heard father... 
Then she sees it, too.  The pale pink is turning redder and redder.  And then the BODIES.  First one, then more, many more.  Torn apart.  Missing limbs.  Those with wide- open wounds, are already drained of blood.  Others are still seeping, leaving trails of deep red in the paler red of the surrounding water. 
Samuel, Margaret and William stand frozen, appalled and fascinated. 
MARION steps out of the workshop and sees the children at the river.  He can't see what they're looking at. Irritated, he walks toward them.  Then, as he nears the river, he sees the color of the water and the bodies that have hypnotized his children.  He quickens his stride, speaking calmly but firmly, careful not to frighten them. 
MARION Up to the house, now.  All of you, come on.  Now. 
EXT.  MARION'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Quiet.  Dark.  Marion stands on the front porch, looking out into the night, listening, hearing nothing.  He glances up at the star-filled sky, tracking his eyes from the Big Dipper to the NORTH STAR. 
BEHIND THE HOUSE, A FIGURE IN THE DARKNESS, carrying a musket, moves from shadow to shadow. 
INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Margaret and Samuel and William talk, their voices low. 
SAMUEL They're going to come. 
MARGARET Quiet. 
SAMUEL We're going to have to fight them off. 
WILLIAM Father will do that. 
SAMUEL They'll probably kill us men and do Lord knows what to you women. 
MARGARET Samuel! 
A SOUND.  They all stop.  Something moved behind the kitchen.  Margaret silently eases the others out of the room, through the darkened hall toward their father. 
SUDDENLY IN FRONT OF THEM, A BLOODY FIGURE 
Big.  Hulking.  In uniform.  Margaret SCREAMS.  William and Samuel CRY OUT.  The figure moves toward them... 
Marion, on the porch, hears the scream, races into the house.  He sees the figure, moves toward it... 
THE FIGURE MOVES INTO THE LIGHT... Marion sees the bloodied face... 
MARION Gabriel! 
Gabriel is wounded, battered and dirty.  He carries a musket and a dispatch case.  He sways.  Marion catches him and eases him to a seat. 
MARGARET You're hurt. 
THOMAS The battle, were you there? 
MARION Margaret, get bandages and water. Thomas, the porch, eyes open. 
Marion checks Gabriel's wounds which are nasty but not life-threatening. 
GABRIEL Have you seen any Redcoats? 
MARION Not yet.  What happened? 
Margaret brings water and linen to Marion who expertly cleans Gabriel's wounds and applies field-dressings. 
GABRIEL It wasn't like Saratoga.  There, we stayed in the trees, but this time Gates marched us straight at the Redcoats.  They fired two volleys into us and we broke like straw.  I was given these dispatches... I saw Virginia Regulars surrender... as they laid down their weapons the British Green Dragoons rode into them and hacked them to bits... killed them all, over two hundred men. 
Marion's appalled. 
MARION They had surrendered? 
Gabriel nods.  Marion's stunned.  Gabriel tries to rise. 
The three wounded Patriots who just left Marion's farm hear the horses coming, stand on the side of the road, raise their arms and a white cloth of surrender. 
The Green Dragoons rein in.  Tarleton stops in front of the three men.  He motions for one of his men to lower his weapon.  Then he speaks calmly, quietly, to the wounded men. 
TARLETON You're surrendering. 
CONTINENTAL SERGEANT Yes, sir. 
TARLETON What unit? 
CONTINENTAL SERGEANT First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton. 
TARLETON Who cared for your wounds? 
They hesitate. 
CONTINENTAL SERGEANT We did. 
TARLETON With a lace table cloth? 
Tarleton turns to his second-in-command, MAJOR WILKINS. 
TARLETON Kill them. 
Tarleton rides off.  Wilkins and several other Dragoons calmly FIRE THEIR PISTOLS, killing the three Patriots. The troops ride off, thundering past the bodies of the three men. 
EXT.  POND BLUFF - DAY 
Marion and his children tend the wounded.  Gabriel, weak but walking, helps.  REDCOAT INFANTRY appears out of the woods, heading toward the house.  Three dozen men.  Scouts and flank units covering the main body.  Marion gathers his family around him, stands and waits. 
The Redcoats get to the house, warily eye the wounded and Marion's family.  A young REDCOAT LIEUTENANT motions his men to check out the house and barn, then looks at the wounded, doing a silent count.  He turns to Marion. 
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT These men are of my regiment.  Thank you. 
Marion nods.  ONE OF THE REDCOATS emerges from the house carrying Gabriel's dispatch case. 
REDCOAT Rebel dispatches, sir. 
Gabriel steps up. 
GABRIEL I carried those.  I was wounded, these people gave me care, they have nothing to do with the dispatches. 
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT I understand. 
The SOUND OF HORSES HOOVES.  All turn and see: 
TARLETON AND THE GREEN DRAGOONS 
Thundering down the road toward the house.  It's an impressive, frightening sight. 
They rein in their horses, stopping in the yard, enveloped by their trailing cloud of dust. 
Tarleton surveys the scene, then speaks to the young Redcoat Lieutenant. 
TARLETON Lieutenant, have a detachment take our wounded to our surgeons at Camden crossing.  Use whatever horses and wagons you can find here. 
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT Yes, sir. 
He hands the dispatch case to Tarleton. 
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT We found this, sir. 
Tarleton opens it and quickly scans the contents. 
TARLETON Who carried this? 
GABRIEL I did. 
TARLETON (to Lt. re: Gabriel) Take this one to Camden, he's a spy. He will be hung. 
Marion quickly steps between Tarleton and Gabriel. 
MARION Colonel, he's a dispatch rider and that's a marked dispatch case. 
Tarleton ignores Marion and continues speaking to the Lieutenant. 
TARLETON Fire the house and barns. 
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT Yes, sir. 
MARION Colonel... 
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT And the Rebel wounded? 
TARLETON Kill them. 
The Redcoat Lieutenant and several of his men are shocked by the order.  Marion is, also, but he's more concerned with Gabriel.  He pushes past some Redcoats and stands at Tarleton's mount, looking up. 
MARION A dispatch rider with a marked case cannot be held for spying. 
Tarleton finally pays attention to Marion.  He looks down at his anguished face and offers the barest of smiles. 
TARLETON We're not going to hold him, we're going to hang him. 
MARION But... 
Tarleton draws his pistol and points it at Marion. Gabriel tries to intercede but is held back by a burly Redcoat Corporal. 
GABRIEL Father... 
TARLETON Oh, he's your son.  You should have taught him about loyalty. 
MARION Colonel, I beg you, please reconsider.  By the rules of war, a dispatch rider with a marked case... 
Tarleton controls his shifting mount, keeping his pistol trained on Marion's face. 
TARLETON Would you like a lesson in the rules of war? 
CHARLOTTE They're asleep. 
Marion is silent.  Charlotte pours water into a washbowl and motions to Marion.  He takes off his shirt.  She begins cleaning away the blood and tending the wound on his neck. 
MARION How did this... how did I let this happen? 
CHARLOTTE You couldn't have known. 
MARION I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her... 
CHARLOTTE Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed. 
MARION I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed. 
She looks at him closely. 
CHARLOTTE If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own. 
MARION I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel. 
He stares past her, looking at the flames in the fireplace.  She tends his wounds. 
EXT.  PORCH - CHARLOTTE'S FARMHOUSE - MORNING 
Marion and Gabriel finish saddling their horses.  Marion embraces Nathan and Samuel.  Then he turns to Margaret, William and Susan. 
WILLIAM When will you be back? 
MARION I don't know, William. 
WILLIAM Tomorrow? 
Marion winces.  Margaret puts her arm around William. 
MARGARET No, not tomorrow. 
Marion kisses them both, then moves on to Susan, trying to coax a word out of the silent four-year-old: 
MARION Goodbye? 
She just looks at him. 
MARION Just one word?  Goodbye?  That's all I want. 
Susan shakes her head.  He sighs, rises and turns to Charlotte.  They hesitate, then embrace, hugging deeply but a bit awkwardly, holding each other just a moment longer than one would expect.  She looks up at him... he kisses her on the cheek. 
Marion mounts up.  And he and Gabriel head off, Susan, unnoticed and unheard, whispers: 
SUSAN Goodbye. 
Marion and Gabriel ride away. 
EXT.  CAMDEN ROAD - DAY 
Marion and Gabriel ride past the signs of a small skirmish.  Bodies.  Abandoned wagons.  Dead horses.  A burning farm. 
EXT.  CAMDEN HILLSIDE - DAY 
Marion and Gabriel ride to the crest of a hill.  A vista spreads out before them.  They see an awesome sight -- A MASSIVE SLASH OF RED approaches a MASSIVE SLASH OF BLUE. A battle is taking place about five miles away. 
Gabriel starts to spur his horse but Marion restrains him. 
MARION No, it's too late. 
Gabriel stops.  Marion points out brightly colored clusters of men behind each army. 
MARION Command posts... Patriot... British... 
The distant slash of red stops.  Marion and Gabriel hear only a GENTLE WIND and some nearby SONGBIRDS. 
Then, from a black mass of the side of the red slash, a sudden, silent eruption of white smoke. 
An instant later, the blue slash quivers.  A moment later the SOUND OF THE CANNONS, RUMBLES UP THE HILL and rolls over Marion and Gabriel. 
The RED SLASH STOPS moving.  It darkens as thousands of Redcoats raise their muskets and the front ranks kneel into firing position. 
Marion's eyes dart.  He knows what's coming. 
MARION Break for the trees... break for the trees... 
A MASSIVE ERUPTION OF WHITE SMOKE billows from the red slash.  An instant later, the blue line starts to break up as hundreds of distant Patriots fall. 
The SOUND OF THE BRITISH MUSKETS reaches Marion and Gabriel like the pattering of rain. 
Then the SMOKE OF INEFFECTIVE, SCATTERED VOLLEYS erupts from the Patriot lines.  The red line holds firm. 
MARION Send them to cover!  Goddamn you! 
But the blue line of the Patriots stays in the open field. 
From behind the Redcoats, FAST-MOVING GREEN AND RED MASSES move quickly onto the battlefield.  CAVALRY. 
GABRIEL Father, we have to do something... 
The British cavalry slams into the blue line, shattering it.  Tiny bits of blue move in every direction. 
GABRIEL Father... 
MARION It's already over. 
Marion watches, appalled.  At this distance the moving slashes of color and billowing smoke are strangely beautiful.  Marion turns his horse and heads down the hill, toward the rear of the Patriot lines. 
EXT.  AMERICAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT 
A nightmare.  SCREAMS OF AGONY.  A few hundred battered, Patriot survivors treat their wounded and prepare to move out.  The battle, so bloodless and beautiful at a distance, has, in its aftermath, become horrifically painful and ugly. 
Marion and Gabriel ride into camp, passing nervous sentries and a field surgery which is surrounded by pools of blood and amputated legs and arms.  Marion sees HARRY LEE at a make-shift command post, barking orders, trying to pull things together. 
GABRIEL I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston. 
MARION Is that so? 
GABRIEL Yes, sir. (beat) My father taught me. 
Marion looks at Gabriel closely. 
MARION Did your father teach you humility? 
GABRIEL He tried.  It didn't take. 
Marion looks Gabriel up and down. 
MARION Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island. 
GABRIEL Yes, sir. 
They mount up. 
MARION And, Corporal... (beat) ... be careful. 
GABRIEL Yes... (beat) ... father. 
They ride off in different directions. 
EXT.  BRADFORD VILLAGE - NIGHT 
Marion rides into a small village, passing several bodies in blue Continental uniforms, hanging from lampposts. Marion stops in front of a tavern, dismounts and enters. 
INT.  TAVERN - BRADFORD - NIGHT 
As Marion walks in he's greeted by cold stares from half- a-dozen men, huddles over their drinks. 
MARION I'm looking for John Billings. 
BARTENDER He's dead. 
Marion looks closely at the grim, suspicious men. 
MARION If he comes back from the dead, tell him Francis Marion is looking for him. 
BARTENDER I'll be sure to do that. 
As Marion turns to leave he notices an open bottle of Madeira on one of the tables.  He stops. 
MARION I'll wait.  Miracles happen. 
A stand-off.  Then, a hulking FIGURE appears in the shadows at the back doorway.  He's JOHN BILLINGS, big, coarse, about Marion's age.  Billings jerks his head for Marion to join him in the back room. 
INT.  BACK ROOM - TAVERN - NIGHT 
Dark.  Marion and billings talk over a bottle. 
BILLINGS You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia? 
MARION I expect to try. 
BILLINGS Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis? 
MARION It worked.  How many men can you raise? 
BILLINGS Not many.  Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose... (beat) What about you?  You've got a lot to lose. 
Marion drains his glass and stands up. 
MARION You coming, or not? 
Billings drains his glass.  They walk out together. 
EXT.  TAVERN - BRADFORD - NIGHT 
Marion and Billings ride away from the tavern, passing the hanging Patriot bodies. 
EXT.  SNOW'S ISLAND - SANTEE SWAMPS - NIGHT 
A CACOPHONY OF BIRDS AND INSECTS.  Swamp maples and willows form a canopy over moss-covered mounds and pools of plant-choked water. 
Gabriel leads several men, riding along a dry path that snakes through the swamp.  They cross a narrow land bridge onto a wooded island, joining a dozen-and-a-half men, including Marion who kneels at a campfire. 
CLOSE SHOT:  Several of Thomas' brightly painted LEAD SOLDIERS MELT in a cast-iron pan.  The little men fall to their knees then lose form, turning into bubbling, molten metal. 
The new arrivals dismount and greet the others. 
Gabriel steps up behind Marion and watches as he pours the lead into a bullet mold, closes the lid and dips the mold into a bucket of water which HISSES and STEAMS. 
GABRIEL Father, this war is about more than Thomas. 
Marion doesn't look up. 
MARION Is it? 
GABRIEL If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself. 
MARION How old are you? 
GABRIEL You know how old I am. 
MARION God help us all when you're forty. 
Marion puts some more lead soldiers into the pan.  Gabriel shakes his head, turns away and goes to tend his horse. 
EXT.  SNOW'S ISLAND ENCAMPMENT - MORNING 
Day breaks.  A low, thick swamp mist covers the encampment.  Marion, sits alone by the embers of last night's campfire.  The men are awake.  Some eat, others talk. 
Marion pulls himself out of his dark reverie.  He takes the bullets from the mold and puts them in a pouch attached to his weapons' belt.  Then he rises and heads over to the men. 
GABRIEL Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear. 
MARION Flanking riders? 
GABRIEL I didn't see any. 
Marion nods and motions to his men who check their weapons and pass the word.  Gabriel ties up his horse and takes a position near his father. 
EXT.  SANTEE ROAD - NIGHT 
The British convoy rounds the curve.  When two-thirds of the wagons have crossed the bridge, Marion FIRES, killing the Redcoat of highest rank, a CAPTAIN. 
BILLINGS AND DALTON heave CORKED BOTTLES which break, spreading their OILY CONTENTS on the wooden bridge. 
BROTHER JOSEPH fires a FLAMING ARROW, igniting the oil. 
The BRIDGE BURSTS INTO FLAMES, cutting off the tail of the convoy, stranding a dozen wagons and the herd of horses on Marion's side of the river. 
A REDCOAT LIEUTENANT takes command. 
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT Across the river!  Covering fire! Double rank! 
Marion calls to his men. 
MARION Epaulets first... Kill the officers. 
Marion and his men FIRE A WITHERING VOLLEY, KILLING ALL REDCOATS OF RANK -- two lieutenants, a sergeant and several corporals. 
The LEADERLESS REDCOAT PRIVATES take cover as Marion's men OPEN UP on the Redcoats on their side of the river. 
MARION THE WAGONS! 
With half of his men FIRING COVER, Marion and the other half run to the wagons, passing Redcoat dead and wounded... 
DALTON, notices a WOUNDED REDCOAT and pauses... 
The Redcoat looks up imploringly at Dalton who finishes reloading, then coldly FIRES, KILLING THE helpless Redcoat... 
Marion, Gabriel and Rev. Oliver see Dalton kill the wounded Redcoat as they race toward the wagons, British musketballs SPLINTERING TREES all around them... 
The horses nearest the burning bridge are terrified, BUCKING AND REARING, STRUGGLING in their traces... 
MARION LEAPS INTO THE SEAT of one wagon.  Gabriel and Billings grab the reins of two more wagons. 
The Redcoats keep up a STEADY FIRE.  TWO OF MARION'S MEN FALL, one dead another wounded. 
Marion, Gabriel and Billings STRUGGLE TO CONTROL THE FRIGHTENED HORSES, backing them up around the curve to the cover of the woods. 
MARION'S REARGUARD, Brother Joseph, Abner, Dan Scott and others, withdraws in leapfrog, FIRING BACK ACROSS THE RIVER. 
BRITISH MUSKET BALLS SLAM into the trees and SPLINTER THE WAGONS... 
Another of Marion's men is WOUNDED.  Two of his comrades HEAVE HIM onto one of the wagons... 
As Marion's men get the wagons turned and unblocked from each other, they DRIVE THEM OFF, one after another... 
Brother Joseph, Abner and the rest of the rearguard make it to Marion and LEAP INTO HIS WAGON... 
MARION snaps the reins and they THUNDER OFF, away from the BURNING BRIDGE and the FIRING Redcoats. 
EXT.  SNOW'S ISLAND - DAY 
Marion's men tend their wounded and look through the British wagons, taking inventory. 
REV. OLIVER ... two-hundred-sixty-six Brown Bess muskets, forty-one casks of powder, balls, tamping... 
BILLINGS We have enough arms for an army. Now all we need is an army. 
Marion checks out a wagon full of tools with DAN SCOTT and ROB FIELDING, a couple of sharp-eyed craftsmen.  They overlap dialogue, rapidly speaking the private language of colonial artisans. 
SCOTT Reamer, boring tool... 
MARION Swage, broach, etching tool... 
FIELDING A rolling gunsmith's shop... 
SCOTT We can rifle those musket barrels... 
FIELDING Get another hundred yards out of 'em... 
MARION We'll need a forge... 
SCOTT Easy enough... 
MARION We've got clay to make a chamber... 
FIELDING Oak to make charcoal... 
SCOTT Oil cloth and barrel staves to make a bellows... 
MARION And we can yank a wagon wheel, weight it, rig a piston and drive shaft and we'll have a flywheel to power the bellows... 
Scott and Fielding exchange an impressed look. 
SCOTT (to Fielding) That's why he's a colonel. 
Scott and Fielding roll up their sleeves and get to work. Marion hears a COMMOTION OF BARKING DOGS AND YELLING MEN and strides over to find Billings cowering before TWO HUGE GREAT DANES who stand guard at one of the wagons. 
BILLINGS Shoot them!  Shoot the damn things! 
Dalton prepares to do so. 
MARION Put that pistol down! 
SCOTT They followed us from the bridge. They won't let anyone near the wagon. 
Marion steps forward, speaking softly but firmly to the dogs. 
Marion reads Cornwallis' journal.  He looks up, stretches and walks over to a campfire where Gabriel, Billings and Rev. Oliver cook.  The dogs follow at a distance. 
BILLINGS Well? 
MARION I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes. 
BILLINGS Cheerful news to greet the morn. 
MARION His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness. 
They all turn to Marion. 
MARION Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it. 
GABRIEL Father? 
MARION Pride is his weakness. 
The men consider that. 
BILLINGS Personally, I'd prefer stupidity. 
MARION Pride will do. 
BEGIN MONTAGE:  Series of shots as follows: 
-- A VOLLEY OF MUSKET FIRE erupts from some thick underbrush, cutting down half of a squadron of Redcoats on the march.  The surviving Redcoats FIRE BACK into the trees at unseen targets to little effect. 
-- Marion rides with about fifty men. 
-- A British supply convoy makes its way through the woods.  Suddenly, Marion's men appear, rising up from the ground as if by magic, having been camouflaged by leaves and brush.  They OPEN FIRE on the convoy escort, which holds for a moment, then flees. 
-- Marion rides with about seventy-five men. 
-- Cornwallis finishes reading a dispatch and furiously flings it across the room. 
-- Marion rides with about one hundred men. 
-- Snow's Island.  Marion and his men do an inventory of a large haul of stolen British supply wagons.  The booty includes dozens of BRASS MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS, some of which Marion's men BLARE in celebration. 
-- Marion rides with about one-hundred-fifty men. 
-- Marion, Gabriel, and some of the other men watch as the flaming supports of a BURNING WOODEN BRIDGE collapse into a river. 
-- A seething Cornwallis stands at the same spot, looking at the charred, now cooled, remains of the bridge. Cornwallis angrily mounts up and rides off.  His contrite staff officers mount up and follow. 
-- Snow's Island.  Marion sits with his muddy feet on Cornwallis' campaign desk, reading Cornwallis' journal, with Cornwallis' Great Danes at his side. 
EXT.  CAMDEN - NIGHT 
Glittering lights shine from the Camden Inn, a grand structure in the center of town. 
A line of OPULENT CARRIAGES discharges well-dressed passengers, arriving for a ball.  Ladies in their finery. Patrician husbands.  Redcoat and Green Dragoon officers in magnificent dress uniforms. 
INT.  CORNWALLIS' PERSONAL QUARTERS - EVENING 
Cornwallis, standing in front of a full-length mirror, is dressed by his VALET while Major Halbert, Colonel Huntington and Tarleton look on. 
CORNWALLIS Why am I here, Colonel Halbert? 
MAJOR HALBERT For the ball, sir? 
Cornwallis holds his temper. 
CORNWALLIS Why, after six weeks, are we still here to attend a ball.  By now, we should be attending balls in North Carolina, not South Carolina. 
MAJOR HALBERT Our supply line, sir? 
CORNWALLIS Excellent guess, Major. 
The valet puts a dress coat on Cornwallis who looks at the garment with deepest disdain. 
CORNWALLIS And what, praytell, is this? 
VALET Uh... I borrowed it from Colonel North.  I took it in at the back, added wider epaulets, a court sash and looped gold braiding on the cuffs... 
CORNWALLIS It's a horse blanket. (to Major Halbert) First my personal baggage, then half the bridges and ferries between here and Charleston burned, a dozen convoys attacked.  Colonel, if you can't secure our supply line against militia, how do you expect to do so against Colonial regulars or the French when they come? 
COLONEL HALBERT Sir, they're not like regulars, we can't find them and we don't know when or where they're going to strike. 
CORNWALLIS How impolite.  And who leads these clever, secretive fellows? 
COLONEL HALBERT We don't know, sir.  He's called, the Commander by some, the Swamp Fox by others. 
CORNWALLIS Colonel, I'm a civilized man but I'm finding to difficult to remain civil.  Secure my supply line. 
COLONEL HALBERT Yes, sir. 
Cornwallis looks at his reflection with dismay, sighs and strides out.  Tarleton, amused, follows. 
EXT.  CAMDEN STREET - NIGHT 
At the far end of town Marion, Gabriel, Billings, Dalton, Scott and several other men slip through the shadows into an alley.  The lights from the ball shine from down the street and the MUSICAL STRAINS of a MINUET drift to them through the night. 
EXT.  ARMORY - NIGHT 
A block-like building on the far edge of town.  A pair of REDCOATS stand guard.  A PAIR OF DRUNKEN REDCOATS stagger out of a side-street, SINGING A MUMBLING SONG.  The Redcoat guards look at the drunk Redcoats enviously. 
REDCOAT GUARD Hey, what you got there? 
The drunken Redcoats look up, bringing their faces into the light -- THE DRUNKEN REDCOATS ARE BILLINGS AND DALTON. 
BILLINGS We got our own little party... 
DALTON To hell with the officers and their fancy dress ball... 
GUARD Give us a nip, here. 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE 
Gabriel and several of Marion's men take supplies from Green, Anne, and some other townspeople.  Gabriel looks at Anne. 
GABRIEL If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea. 
ANNE You call that a compliment? 
GABRIEL It's a start. 
She gives him a bit of a smile.  He checks out her teeth. 
GABRIEL They look nice.  As white as can be. 
She tries to glare but she can't help but laugh. 
MARION AND BILLINGS watch as Anne gives Gabriel some apples which he tosses into the air, one-by-one, catching them behind his back, a cocky move, executed with a disarming smile that makes Anne laugh again.  Marion smiles at his son's flirtation.  Billings smiles as well. 
BILLINGS He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly. 
MARION (softly) No, he takes after his mother... 
Billings is taken aback by the gentleness of Marion's words. 
MARION ... the younger ones barely remember her but Gabriel spent more time with Elizabeth... she taught him well, guided him, she was his North Star and mine... her father was a minister, in Boston, did you know that? 
Billings nods. 
MARION ... Gabriel's already a better man than I could ever hope to be... 
Marion hears himself and pulls his eyes from Gabriel, adopting a coarse, joking tone. 
MARION What do you mean, old and ugly? 
BILLINGS You got me beat on both accounts. 
MARION The hell I do. 
They mount up, grateful to leave the sincerity behind. 
Gabriel sees Marion and his men starting to ride off.  He says goodbye to Anne, then RUNS TO HIS HORSE, MOUNTING WITH A DRAMATIC LEAP.  He GALLOPS up, taking his place at his father's side.  Marion doesn't turn to look at him, but he knows he's there. 
EXT.  CAROLINA ROAD - DAY 
A patchwork of fields with a village visible in the distance.  The ROLLINS BOYS, 10 and 12, work a field, harvesting grain.  Hearing the SOUND OF HORSES' HOOVES, they stop and listen. 
Then they see a CLOUD OF DUST rising over the ridge line. Growing excited, they throw down their scythes and race down the hillside, madly stumbling and falling, trying to intersect the approaching sound. 
At the bottom of the hill they pass their father, BEN ROLLINS, who watches his sons plant themselves on the side of the road, gazing in awe at: 
MARION AND HIS MEN, THUNDERING BY.  They're an impressive sight, a hundred-and-fifty heavily armed men, on powerful mounts, raising a cloud of dust as they gallop down the road. 
EXT.  CHARLESTON ROAD - DAY 
Marion and forty of his men, including Gabriel, sit on their motionless horses in the middle of the road.  There are a number of new faces among Marion's men, among them Ben Rollins.  Gabriel is lost in thought. 
MARION Gabriel?  Are you asleep? 
GABRIEL We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some. 
BILLINGS You got salt last week. 
GABRIEL Oh, right. (beat) Baking powder, we need baking powder. 
BILLINGS We've got plenty of baking powder. You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago. 
Gabriel sighs.  They hear a SOUND APPROACHING, then see two British wagons round a curve with a guard of only SIX REDCOATS, commanded by a REDCOAT SERGEANT.  The Redcoat Sergeant signals stop. 
REDCOAT SERGEANT Halt.  Look alive, boys. 
The young Redcoat privates nervously UNSHOULDER THEIR MUSKETS. 
MARION Sergeant, this road is closed. Those wagons now belong to the Continental Army. 
REDCOAT SERGEANT Ready arms!  By twos! 
Marion's surprised by the Sergeant's order. 
MARION Sergeant, there's no reason for you and your men to die.  Just leave the wagons and go. 
REDCOAT SERGEANT Steady, boys... 
Marion sighs and lets loose with a PIERCING WHISTLE.  The underbrush parts and more of Marion's men show themselves, MUSKETS LEVELED at the outnumbered Redcoats. 
REDCOAT SERGEANT This is the King's highway and I advise you and your men to make way. (to his men) Prepare to fire. 
Marion exchanges a look with Rev. Oliver who, like Marion, doesn't want to kill these men.  Seeing no other option, Marion turns to give the order, then stops, hearing a FAINT BARELY DETECTABLE, RUMBLING SOUND... 
A moment later Brother Joseph hears it as well... HORSES HOOVES, LOTS OF THEM, growing louder by the second, THUNDERING toward them from the road behind the British wagons... 
Then, the SOUND OF MORE HORSES, coming in fast on both flanks. 
MARION It's a trap... 
The canvas sides of the British wagons are THROWN UP and DOZENS OF REDCOATS, armed with muskets, spill out... 
Marion's unmounted men run to their horses, LEAPING into their saddles... 
Then GREEN DRAGOONS appear, galloping down the wooded slopes on both flanks, astonishing horsemen, weaving through the trees without slacking their pace, SWORDS DRAWN, PISTOLS PRIMED... 
REDCOAT SERGEANT FIRE! 
A THUNDEROUS VOLLEY ERUPTS from the Redcoat infantry, KILLING several of Marion's men... 
Marion's men FIRE BACK from their BUCKING MOUNTS, most of their shots going awry... 
Behind the British wagons, a huge detachment of GREEN DRAGOONS appears, TARLETON among them... 
Marion takes a last look in the direction of the departing Tarleton.  Then he dismounts and hurries over to help the wounded.  Gabriel watches his father for a moment, then joins him with the wounded. 
EXT.  WOODED GLEN - NIGHT 
Dark.  Marion and his battered men gather, taking stock. Men drift in, mounted and on foot in ones and twos, past wary sentries.  GABRIEL RIDES UP, dismounts and reports to Marion, out of earshot of the other men. 
GABRIEL Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured. 
MARION I should have killed him when I had the chance? 
GABRIEL When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family? 
MARION No... 
GABRIEL Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause. 
Marion is silent. 
GABRIEL There will be a time and a place for revenge but killing Tarleton at the expense of your duty serves no one but yourself. (beat) Stay the course. 
The parental-sounding formality of Gabriel's words brings a thin smile to Marion's face. 
MARION Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper. 
GABRIEL She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan. 
MARION You learned her lessons better than I. 
GABRIEL She got me at a more impressionable age. 
Marion smiles, nods a silent thanks to his son and heads over to help with the wounded. 
EXT.  MARION'S ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT 
A cold, winter rain falls.  Most of Marion's grim men are huddled in lean-to's and around campfires.  Green and several other Pembroke townspeople unload a wagon of supplies while Marion, Scott and Fielding stow the provisions. 
Gabriel and Anne sit at a fire, under the cover of a lean- to, taking quietly.  He's troubled.  She tries to be hopeful. 
ANNE Next time we'll bring more blankets. 
GABRIEL That would be nice. 
ANNE Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow. 
GABRIEL That would be nice, too. 
She takes a pot off the campfire and pours him a cup of tea. 
ANNE Just because the French didn't come this fall, doesn't mean they're never going to come. 
He nods and takes a drink of the tea.  She smiles. Gabriel smiles back to her, revealing a mouthful of ink- stained, black teeth.  Before she has time to laugh... 
ROLLINS RIDES HARD INTO CAMP.  Marion hurries over, accompanied by the Great Danes.  The other men gather around. 
ROLLINS They're to be hung! 
GABRIEL But they're prisoners-of-war! 
Marion isn't as surprised as Gabriel.  He is, however, taken aback by Gabriel's black teeth.  Gabriel notices everyone looking at his mouth. 
Anne is embarrassed and regretful, seeing her joke fly in the face of the troubling news. 
EXT.  FORT CAROLINA - DAY 
A REDCOAT SENTRY sees a lone figure on horseback ride out of distant woods.  It's Rev. Oliver, carrying a white flag with one hand, holding a dispatch case in the other.  The sentry calls to the Commander of the Watch. 
REDCOAT SENTRY Sir. 
INT.  CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - FORT CAROLINA - DAY 
A temporary HQ has been set up in a commandeered farmhouse.  Cornwallis stands uncomfortably while a tailor measures him and marks alterations on a partially completed uniform.  Tarleton enters. 
TARLETON General, a message from the commander of the rebel militia. 
Cornwallis reads the message. 
CORNWALLIS It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley. 
TARLETON Are you going to meet with him? 
CORNWALLIS Most certainly.  Arrange it. 
EXT.  CAROLINA ROAD - DAY 
Marion rides, trailed by Cornwallis' Great Danes.  Behind him, two dozen heavily armed Patriots, including Rev. Oliver who carries a white flag. 
A detachment of Redcoat Cavalry, lead by Major Halbert, waits.  The Redcoats fall in on either side.  They ride on. 
EXT.  FORT CAROLINA - DAY 
Redcoat sentries see the approaching Patriots and Redcoats and open the gates.  Billings and the other Patriots stop, a hundred yards outside the barricades. 
MARION alone rides through the gates, flanked by the British cavalry, the Great Danes following closely behind. 
INT.  CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
Major Halbert ushers Marion in.  The Great Danes follow sniffing curiously, sensing something or someone. 
MAJOR HALBERT Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently. 
MARION Thank you. 
MAJOR HALBERT You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that... 
MARION (interrupting) I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley. 
MAJOR HALBERT Yes, quite, but you should know that... 
MARION As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement. (beat) And my men are excellent marksmen. 
Cornwallis sighs. 
CORNWALLIS Very well, let us move on to... 
MARION Prisoner exchange. 
CORNWALLIS Sir? 
MARION You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back. 
CORNWALLIS I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war. 
MARION If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men. 
CORNWALLIS What officers? 
Marion steps to the window, checks the view.  A wooded hillside is visible in the distance.  Marion reaches into his jacket... 
The Dragoons move on him... 
Marion extracts not a weapon, but a spyglass, which he hands to Cornwallis. 
MARION In the clearing, just down from the crest, to the left of the dark pines... 
Cornwallis looks through the spyglass. 
VIEW THROUGH THE SPYGLASS 
Though difficult to see clearly through the shimmering haze, Cornwallis can just make out a row of bound Redcoat officers, with Patriot soldiers holding muskets at their heads. 
CORNWALLIS turns coldly to Marion. 
CORNWALLIS Their names, ranks and posts? 
MARION They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night. 
Cornwallis glares at Marion. 
CORNWALLIS You are not a gentleman. 
Marion can't help but laugh at the insult. 
MARION If your conduct is the measure of a gentleman, I take that as a compliment. (coldly) Get my men. 
Cornwallis turns to Colonel Huntington. 
CORNWALLIS Arrange the exchange. 
Colonel Huntington leaves to do so. 
MARION Thank you, General.  I'm sure your officers will thank you, as well. 
Marion salutes Cornwallis who doesn't return the salute. 
THEN MARION TURNS TO TARLETON.  He walks up to him and looks him in the eye. 
MARION You don't remember me, do you? 
Tarleton examines Marion's face, finding him familiar, but unable to place him... then Tarleton remembers... 
TARLETON Ah, yes, that boy. 
Tarleton calmly holds Marion's glare. 
TARLETON Ugly business, doing one's duty. 
MARION Yes, ugly business. 
Marion takes a step closer to Tarleton, then speaks very softly, very slowly, very clearly. 
MARION If you are alive when this war is over, I'm going to kill you. 
Marion locks his eyes on Tarleton to make it perfectly clear that he means what he says.  Tarleton tries to cover his reaction but it's apparent that he's taken aback by Marion's icy words. 
Marion turns and walks out.  The two Great Danes start to follow, but Cornwallis SNAPS A COMMAND: 
CORNWALLIS Jupiter!  Mars! 
THE DOGS FREEZE, looking after Marion, who doesn't turn back.  The dogs reluctantly sidle over to Cornwallis' side. 
EXT.  ASSEMBLY YARD - FORT CAROLINA - DAY 
Redcoats glare at Marion who sits, mounted, waiting.  His eighteen men are led out of the prison blockhouse and directed to waiting horses.  Surprised to be freed, they mount up. 
CORNWALLIS AND TARLETON step out onto the front porch of Cornwallis' headquarters and watch as Marion and his men ride toward the gate. 
THE TWO GREAT DANES, watch Marion from Cornwallis' side. 
Cornwallis motions to the Redcoat Sentries to OPEN THE GATES.  They do so and Marion and his men, without hurrying, ride out. 
Then, just as the gates are closing behind him, Marion, without turning around, lets loose with a PIERCING WHISTLE... 
THE TWO GREAT DANES INSTANTLY RACE AFTER MARION, making it through the gates just as they're closing. 
CORNWALLIS, seeing his dogs run after Marion, SPUTTERS, then turns and storms back into his quarters. 
TARLETON, still off-balance from Marion's parting statement, watches Marion ride away.  Then he turns to Major Wilkins who stands nearby. 
TARLETON Take a detachment and go get our officers. 
Wilkins hurries off. 
EXT.  HILLSIDE CLEARING - ABOVE FORT CAROLINA - DAY 
Major Wilkins and a detachment of Green Dragoons ride up the wooded slope toward the bound Redcoat officers that Cornwallis saw through the spyglass.  As the Dragoons ride out of the trees into the clearing they stop dead, seeing that: 
SUSAN Why didn't he come? 
GABRIEL He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men. 
SUSAN He left us. 
GABRIEL I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll come back as soon as he can. 
Susan says nothing.  Gabriel continues, hopefully. 
GABRIEL There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you. 
SUSAN I don't care.  I hate him. 
GABRIEL You don't hate him. 
SUSAN Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back. 
Gabriel kneels down and embraces her.  She stands coldly with her arms at her sides. 
EXT.  MARION'S ENCAMPMENT - DAY 
An astonished Marion talks to Gabriel. 
MARION She spoke?  Susan spoke? 
GABRIEL Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along. 
MARION I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it... 
The cloud passes quickly. 
MARION Tell me everything she said, word for word. 
Gabriel hesitates. 
GABRIEL She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her. 
MARION She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that? 
Gabriel nods. 
MARION Isn't that something. 
Marion shakes his head at the thought, smiling to himself. Gabriel, uncomfortable with the lie, changes the subject. 
GABRIEL Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about. 
MARION What? 
GABRIEL Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there. 
Marion nods and curiously follows Gabriel. 
EXT.  PEMBROKE VILLAGE - NIGHT 
Dark.  The village square is deserted.  Marion follows Gabriel into the shadow of the village church.  They dismount, tie up their horses and enter the back door of the church. 
INT.  CHURCH - PEMBROKE VILLAGE - NIGHT 
Marion walks in and stops dead.  At the altar of the small sanctuary, HALF-A-DOZEN PEOPLE stand with Rev. Oliver.  At the center of the tiny gathering is Anne Green, flanked by her parents. 
GABRIEL Father, I'm looking for a best man. 
Marion is stunned but recovers quickly. 
MARION I'd be honored. 
They share a moment, then head down the aisle.  Marion greets Anne's parents, shaking hands with her father and bowing to her mother.  Abner, at the door, nods that the coast is clear. 
REV. OLIVER Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony... 
MARION feels every word, looking straight ahead but knowing that he's standing next to his son. 
EXT.  CHURCH - NIGHT 
In the shadows behind the church, the bride and groom say goodbye to the wedding party.  Anne talks quietly with her parents.  Marion and Gabriel talk nearby. 
GABRIEL Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days? 
MARION Granted.  Where are you going? 
GABRIEL Cheraw Falls. 
MARION It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born. 
GABRIEL I know. 
They're silent for a moment. 
MARION She would have been pleased. 
Gabriel nods, then turns to his horse, unnecessarily checking his pack ropes.  Anne joins them.  Marion embraces her and gives her a fatherly kiss. 
ANNE I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning. 
MARION It's alright.  I'm very happy for you. 
He helps her mount up.  Abner, on guard near the road, motions them on.  They all watch as Gabriel and Anne ride off. 
EXT.  WOODED ROAD - NIGHT 
Marion, Rev. Oliver and Abner ride slowly down the road. It's a beautiful, moonlit night.  Marion breaks the silence, speaking as much for himself as the others. 
MARION It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars. 
REV. OLIVER For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part. 
Marion, at the head of the rest of the brigade, waits next to an increasingly frantic, Rollins.  They see Gabriel wave, signaling all clear. 
MARION, ROLLINS AND THE OTHER MEN RIDE to the house. Rollins is the first to see THE BODIES.  Horrified, he reins back and dismounts, almost falling. 
His TWO SONS, WIFE, an OLDER MAN and WOMAN, lie dead in the dirt.  Marion's men silently watch Rollins' agony. Weeping and confused, he moves in a mad, staccato manner, as if he were a marionette, whose strings were being jerked by a drunken puppeteer. 
Marion and Rev. Oliver dismount and move toward him. Rollins sees them coming.  He hardens and strides to his horse, pulling his FLINTLOCK PISTOL from his saddle holster. 
Rev. Oliver reaches out to embrace Rollins. 
REV. OLIVER It's not time for vengeance, it's time to mourn and... 
ROLLINS PUTS THE PISTOL TO HIS HEAD AND PULLS THE TRIGGER, BLOWING HIS BRAINS OUT. 
Every man freezes in place.  For a long moment no one moves, no one speaks.  Then Marion pulls himself together and addresses the men: 
MARION Five day furlough for all men. Abner, Dan, Reverend, spread the word.  We'll reform at Acworth.  Any man who doesn't come back won't be thought a coward or uncommitted to the cause.  Attend to your families. 
The men mount up.  Marion and Gabriel ride off together. 
EXT.  PEMBROKE - NIGHT 
Marion scans the night as Gabriel and Anne mount up.  The three of them ride off, pulling a line of horses, some heavily loaded packhorses and some saddled but empty mounts. 
EXT.  SHACK - SHANTY TOWN - NIGHT 
Dark.  Quiet.  Gabriel and Anne wait in the shadows while Marion cocks his musket, checks his pistols and walks slowly toward the shack. 
He warily checks every shadow.  No one anywhere.  Then a SOUND -- A SQUEAL OF LAUGHTER, immediately followed by: 
MARGARET (O.S.) It's him!  I told you it was him! 
MARION'S CHILDREN RACE OUT OF THE SHADOWS to Marion.  He's practically bowled over as Margaret, Nathan, Samuel and William fling themselves into his arms. 
NATHAN Father! 
WILLIAM Papa... 
CHARLOTTE STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS, watching the reunion as Marion covers the children with kisses, trying to hug all of them at once as they cling to him as if they'll never let go.  MARION AND CHARLOTTE LOCK EYES over the heads of the children. 
MARION Thank you. 
Charlotte smiles.  Then Marion notices SUSAN peeking out from behind Charlotte's patched and mended skirt.  He kneels down and opens his arms to her but she doesn't move. 
He smiles to her and speaks softly: 
MARION Susan... 
She looks coldly at Marion, tightens her grip on Charlotte's skirt and retreats further behind her.  Marion looks to Charlotte who nods with guarded reassurance. Then his attention is drawn away by the demanding embraces of his other children. 
EXT.  CHERAW FALLS PATH - NIGHT 
Marion rides, leading his children, Charlotte and Anne up a steep, narrow path that cuts through a heavily wooded hillside. 
EXT.  CHERAW FALLS - NIGHT 
The remains of a tiny abandoned backcountry farm.  The house is gone, leaving only an overgrown cellar hole. 
Nearby is a barely-standing tobacco shed, one end of which has fallen to the ground.  A SOFT WIND WHISTLES AND WHISPERS through the gaps in the rough-hewn boards of the structure. 
Marion rides up to the edge of the clearing.  A MOCKINGBIRD SCREECHES nearby, startling him.  He looks back at the children, worried, anticipating a negative reaction.  Margaret smiles and turns to the other children, speaking for Marion's benefit. 
MARGARET I told you, things would get better. 
The children smile and dismount. 
INT.  TOBACCO SHED - NIGHT 
POURING RAIN.  The ceiling drips.  Marion lies, awake, with his children huddled against him, sleeping in one of the few dry spots.  They're covered with tattered quilts. 
On the other side of the children, Charlotte is also awake.  She and Marion exchange a long, silent look in the darkness, over the heads of the sleeping children. 
EXT.  WATERFALL OVERLOOK - DAY 
Marion walks the perimeter of their encampment with Nathan and Samuel.  They listen carefully. 
MARION The overlook, up there should be where you post the watch.  Work out a schedule.  Short watches, especially at night. (pointing) If you can catch some of those mockingbirds you can make cages and put them along there for alarms. (motioning for them to follow) Now let's find someplace to cache extra weapons... 
They follow Marion like soldiers. 
EXT.  CHERAW FALLS - DAY 
Marion sits on a rock while Margaret cuts his hair.  She takes her time, touching him on the head and shoulders, extending the process.  Marion, sits back, enjoying it. He notices Susan, nearby, watching silently.  He smiles. She turns away. 
EXT.  TOBACCO SHED - CHERAW FALLS - DAY 
Dark.  Shafts of light shine in through the holes in the roof.  Marion, standing in the shadows, senses someone coming.  He freezes. 
A figure rounds the corner.  It's... William.  MARION YELLS William SQUEALS IN DELIGHT, then chases his father around the corner, tagging him.  They laugh.  Marion covers his eyes and William dashes off to hide. 
EXT.  CHERAW FALLS - RIVERSIDE - DAY 
Marion sits on the side of the river with Susan who avoids looking at him.  Using the knife we've seen him use in battle he cuts slices off an apple and eats them. 
MARION Good apple. 
No response. 
MARION Very good.  Sweet. 
He cuts a slice and offers it to her.  She doesn't take it.  He puts the slice between them.  After a long moment she picks it up but as she's about to eat it, she stops, seeing something on it.  She puts it back. 
Marion looks at the apple slice and sees a dark red splotch on it.  He looks at his knife and realizes that it's dried blood. 
Off-balance, he turns to Susan who stares straight ahead, a thousand miles from Marion. 
EXT.  CHERAW FALLS RIVER - DAY 
Marion spurs his horse straight toward her, GALLOPING toward the running, crying child. 
SUSAN Please, Papa, please don't go. 
MARION RIDES TOWARD HER... 
Charlotte, Anne and Marion's children watch as: 
MARION LEANS OVER IN THE SADDLE without slowing down... 
SWOOPING HER INTO HIS LAP... 
She sits astride the saddle, facing him, her arms wrapped around him, pleading, the words tumbling from her, as fast as she can get them out... 
SUSAN ... I'll talk to you, I'll say anything you want, just tell me what you want me to say, I'll say anything, I promise, please, Papa, just stay... 
Marion envelopes the sobbing wisp of a girl, holding her, letting her cry, fighting his own tears... 
He reins back the horse, stopping in front of the others... 
He pleadingly looks to Charlotte who steps up to the horse... to take Susan... 
Marion gives Susan a final embrace, and covers her face with kisses... 
MARION I'll come back... I promise... 
Marion hands the still crying Susan down to Charlotte... 
Marion, in agony, averts his eyes, yanks his reins, and spurs his horse... 
As he rides away the children take off after him, running. 
Susan seeing the others running after Marion, struggles out of Charlotte's arms, and runs after them as well... 
Marion rides, now joined by Gabriel, faster and faster, leaving a trail of dust... 
The children slow, then stop, one after another, watching as they ride away. 
EXT.  PATRIOT ENCAMPMENT - ACWORTH - EVENING 
Grim.  The most rudimentary of the encampments we've seen. Rain pours.  Some of Marion's men huddle under lean-to's and quickly rigged tents that offer only partial protection from the cold rain. 
Abner and Scott do their best to keep a wet-wood fire going.  Rev. Oliver tries to cook. 
Marion and Gabriel ride up and dismount.  Marion joins Rev. Oliver. 
MARION How many came back? 
REV. OLIVER About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third. 
Marion nods.  He and Gabriel join some of the men under one of the lean-to's. 
EXT.  RIVERSIDE - DAY 
The rain has stopped.  The ground is still wet.  It's spring.  The first buds are on the maple trees.  A fox tentatively comes out of its winter den, followed by a pair of pups. 
Marion stands on the side of a river, looking up at a chevron of Canadian geese flying north. 
EXT.  PEMBROKE - DAY 
The Canadian Geese fly over Anne who is behind her father's store, tying food and provisions to a couple of packhorses.  A mare and a foal cavort in a nearby paddock. 
Suddenly Anne senses someone behind her and turns to see HALF-A DOZEN REDCOATS.  She's initially frightened but the REDCOAT SERGEANT, speaks politely. 
REDCOAT SERGEANT Excuse me, Ma'am, everyone has been requested to gather at the church. 
ANNE Everyone? 
REDCOAT SERGEANT Colonel Tarleton wants to address, the whole village. 
The Redcoat Sergeant deferentially motions for Anne to follow him and his men.  She sees several other townspeople, with Redcoat escorts, already heading down the street.  She follows along. 
EXT.  PEMBROKE VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY 
Tarleton and Wilkins, on horseback, watch as a large, mixed detachment of Green Dragoons and Redcoat Infantry directs the villagers into the church. 
One of the Redcoats walks out of the general store with a bowl of gumdrops.  As he starts giving them to a few of the children their parents waver, unsure of the gesture, but they reluctantly allow the children to take the candy. 
The townspeople are uneasy but they follow the orders of the Redcoats who, though carry muskets, are polite and unthreatening. 
REDCOAT Into the church, please. 
ANOTHER REDCOAT Colonel Tarleton wishes to address all of you. 
Tarleton sees the last of the townspeople enter the church.  He nods to the Redcoats near the door. 
The Redcoats CLOSE THE DOORS, chaining them shut.  The DOOR IS POUNDED ON from the inside. 
VOICE Open this door! 
ANOTHER VOICE By what right are we made prisoners? 
TARLETON NODS TO GASKINS who, along with several rough- looking LOYALIST MILITIAMEN, disappear into the blacksmith shop.  They reappear a moment later with FLAMING TORCHES and approach the church. 
Several Redcoats see what's about to happen and are appalled.  Even some of the Green Dragoons, including Wilkins, are troubled.  Wilkins rides over to Tarleton. 
WILKINS Sir? 
TARLETON Yes, Major. 
Gaskins and the Loyalist Militia stop around the church, torches ready, waiting for the final go-ahead from Tarleton.  The POUNDING AND CALLING from inside the church grows louder. 
WILKINS Sir, there is no honor in this. 
TARLETON The honor is found in the end, not the means.  This will be forgotten. (to Gaskins) Proceed. 
The Redcoats turn to the Redcoat Officers.  The Redcoat officers turn to Wilkins, who struggles with himself. Tarleton calmly watches Wilkins' distress. 
IN THE TENT 
Marion still sits.  A FLY BUZZES.  Gabriel's face has taken on a deathly, ashen look. 
Lee enters the tent.  He's silent for a moment, then speaks softly to Marion. 
LEE You have to bury him. 
No response. 
LEE I'll help you bury him. 
Lee moves toward Gabriel's body. 
MARION Don't touch him. 
LEE How many men have we seen die? 
MARION Two.  Gabriel and Thomas. 
LEE They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this. 
MARION It is ended. 
LEE No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another. (beat) Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice. 
Marion doesn't respond.  Lee waits for a long moment, then he hears the SOUND OF THE DEPARTING TROOPS OUTSIDE THE TENT. 
He looks at Marion, touches him on the shoulder and walks out. 
EXT.  PATRIOT ENCAMPMENT - DAY 
The last of the soldiers move out, leaving their smoldering campfires and refuse.  The only tent that remains is Marion's. 
EXT.  MARION'S TENT - DAY 
Marion sits in his tent, gazing obliquely at Gabriel's body which has grown even more ashen.  A SOLITARY BIRD CRIES in the distance. 
EXT.  WOODED ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT 
A dark, moonless night.  The sky is filled with stars.  A SOFT WIND BLOWS dead leaves along the ground.  A few of the leaves are blown through the opening of Marion's tent. 
INSIDE THE TENT 
Marion looks down, noticing the leaves, HEARING THE WIND. He listens for a moment.  Then he stands and walks out of the tent. 
OUTSIDE THE TENT 
Marion watches the leaves skittering along the ground.  He listens to the wind. 
The HE LOOKS UP AT THE NIGHT SKY.  The stars are bright. His eyes are drawn to the Big Dipper and from there to the Little Dipper and the... 
NORTH STAR. 
Holding his eyes on the faint, but steady star, he gradually reorients himself.  He looks around at the abandoned encampment.  Then he looks into the tent and sees Gabriel's body.  The SOFT WIND BLOWS AROUND HIM. Marion nods in response. 
EXT.  BURIAL GROUND - WOODED ENCAMPMENT - MORNING 
Marion finishes burying Gabriel, putting the last shovelfuls of dirt on the freshly turned earth.  He stands next to the grave, looking down, and says a silent prayer. 
EXT.  YORKTOWN ROAD - DAY 
The AMERICAN FORCES are on the move, all heading in the same direction.  Continentals and militiamen fill the road.  Some on horseback, others in wagons, most on foot. 
Among them, a mixed unit of Continentals and Marion's brigade, at the head of which ride Lee, Dalton, Abner and Rev. Oliver. 
Behind them, a single horseman rides up.  It's MARION. Without speaking, Marion rides up alongside Lee.  They exchange nods. 
Marion rides between Dalton on one side and Rev. Oliver on the other.  They pass a sign that reads, "Yorktown.  20 miles." 
EXT.  YORKTOWN OVERLOOK - DAY 
The road to Yorktown skirts an OVERLOOK with a view of the town and the harbor.  A few dozen arriving Patriots have stopped to look out at the view.  Marion, Lee, Rev. Oliver and Dalton join them. 
The French Fleet is visible in the harbor.  The British encampments are on a pair of peninsulas, one jutting out from land, the other jutting toward the land from a large island.  In a semi-circle around the landward peninsula, the beginnings of the Patriot encirclement are visible. It's a grand and impressive sight. 
Marion and the others turn their horses and head down the road toward the American lines. 
EXT.  YORKTOWN ENCAMPMENT - DAY 
AN INTERMITTENT EXCHANGE OF CANNON FIRE.  Not a battle, but pre-battle pot shots.  Behind the American embattlements, hundreds of American and French soldiers drill, make camp and build secondary fortifications. 
MARION, stands behind a barricade, trying to get a view of the British defenses.  A RUNNER, a boy about fifteen, dashes up to Marion. 
RUNNER You called for me, sir? 
Marion reaches into his pocket and pulls out a single WALNUT which he hands to the boy. 
MARION Take this to General Washington. 
The boy looks at the walnut and then looks at Marion as if he's joking or crazy.  He's neither.  The boy shrugs and runs off with the walnut. 
EXT.  WASHINGTON'S HEADQUARTERS - YORKTOWN 
Staff officers.  Flags.  Tents.  French and American officers look over maps and sort out dispatches. Messengers, runners and dispatch riders come and go hurriedly. 
The flap of the central HQ tent opens and GEORGE WASHINGTON steps out, followed by a pair of AIDES. Washington is tall and powerfully-built, an imposing man, worthy of respect. 
He looks around and sees the awe-struck, slightly confused messenger boy, waiting nearby. 
Washington, holding the walnut in his hand, motions him over. 
WASHINGTON Did you bring me this? 
RUNNER Yes, sir. 
Washington scribbles something on a piece of paper and hands it to the boy. 
Marion closes the journal. 
MARION He has no respect for citizen soldiers.  That's your bait... militia. 
Washington nods, considering it. 
EXT.  CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - YORKTOWN - EVENING 
Under fire.  Cornwallis and his staff.  Major Halbert strides in and gives Cornwallis a dispatch. 
MAJOR HALBERT Sir, a dispatch from General Clinton made it through the rebel lines. 
Cornwallis takes the dispatch and reads it.  It staggers him.  He sits down. 
WILKINS Sir? 
Cornwallis fumes.  His jaw sets with anger.  He slowly crumples the dispatch and speaks with quiet fury. 
CORNWALLIS Call a general staff meeting. 
AIDE Yes, sir. 
EXT.  YORKTOWN - PRE-DAWN 
Marion stands at the American battlements, looking out at the British defensive works.  Above him, stars are visible, but they're fading in the light of the pre-dawn glow from the horizon. 
Marion scans the disappearing stars, searching out the NORTH STAR, but in the increasingly harsh light of this day, he can't find it.  He turns his eyes back to the battlefield. 
EXT.  YORKTOWN BATTLEFIELD - DAY 
The sun has risen but a heavy ground fog limits visibility to a few dozen yards.  Men move like ghosts. 
THE CAMERA finds waiting squadrons of men but in the mist. There is no overview, just separate detachments: 
An orderly regiment of CONTINENTAL CAVALRY, mounted, waiting, steadying their horses. 
Two long lines of CONTINENTAL INFANTRY RESERVES... 
An American Command, including Washington, LaFayette and two dozen staff officers, attended by riders and runners... 
And, finally, MARION AND HIS MEN, who stand in the middle of a long line of Patriot militia in the center of a long, valley-line depression. 
They stand silently, unable to see anything other than each other and the gently slope of the dew-covered grass in front of them. 
They're all grim.  They know what's coming. 
Then, the SOUND OF A SINGLE DRUM, heard but unseen, coming from over the slope... 
Then, MORE DRUMS, more and more, A COMPETITION OF DRUM BEATS... 
Marion's men listen, turning their heads, trying to imagine what is happening on the other side of the rise in front of them. 
MARION MOTIONS FOR HIS OFFICERS, Dalton, Scott, Rev. Oliver and several other Patriot militia officers from other units.  They quickly gather around. 
MARION The British army believes in officers.  I believe in soldiers. After we engage, there will be no more orders.  Every man here must know what I'm about to tell you. 
They listen closely. 
MARION We are the bait in a trap.  We're militia.  Cornwallis thinks we're rabble, nothing more than a bunch of undisciplined farmers.  And if he thinks that's what we are, that's what we're going to give him. Listen up. 
They gather around closer. 
EXT.  BRITISH LINES - DAY 
Cornwallis, surrounded by his staff officers, including Tarleton, stands on a low hill, trying, with the aid of a spyglass to catch the first view of the battlefield as the morning mist begins to burn off. 
Through the fog, he just makes out the American lines.  He turns to Tarleton who also peers through a spyglass. 
CORNWALLIS Do you see that, Colonel? 
TARLETON Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center. 
Cornwallis and Tarleton exchange a pleased look. 
EXT.  LOW MEADOW - YORKTOWN - MORNING 
Marion and his men wait. 
A STRANGE SOUND.  Soft, muted.  The men turn their heads, listening, their eyes shifting. 
They hear the SOUND OF THOUSANDS OF BOOTS ON WET GRASS, advancing... 
THE CAMERA WATCHES THE FACES OF MARION AND HIS MEN as they listen to an unseen army approaching. 
ON MARION'S FACE we see him hearing every sound and we see FLASH CUTS of what he knows he's hearing: 
The BOOTS OF THE UNSEEN SOLDIERS... 
Shouldered muskets CLICKING against pack buckles... 
SILENCE at a stop... 
MORE DRUMS... 
The men around Marion wait. 
THEN, THEY SEE IT... 
A MASSIVE WALL OF RED appears over the rise in front of them... 
Thousands of Redcoats, in perfect formation, marching in lockstep, straight for them. 
Marion sees the fear on his men's faces, but none of them move... 
The BRITISH DRUMS GROW LOUDER AND LOUDER... it's almost enough to drive a man to flight... almost. 
The CAMERA explores the faces of Marion's men, faces that we know, Rev. Oliver, Scott, Abner, Marion.  All are frightened but all are motionless.

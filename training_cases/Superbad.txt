Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg 
July 20, 2006 
OPENING CREDITS OVER SUPER-FUNKY BLAXPLOITATION-STYLE MUSIC, which builds to an exciting crescendo filling us with the expectation of a thrilling, action-packed opening sequence. 
Instead we get: 
INT. SETH'S CAR - MORNING 
Seth, seventeen, a bit heavyset, in the midst of a sad attempt at growing a goatee and clearly a terrible driver, cruises along while fiddling with the CD player. He pulls out his cell and dials. 
SETH Yo. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. EVAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Evan, seventeen, a little too tall and slim, a boy who clearly never figured out how to style his hair, is finishing off a bowl of cereal. He is on his cell phone. 
EVAN What's up? 
SETH I was doing research last night, for next year, and I think I'm gonna go with Bang Bus. 
EVAN Which one's Bang Bus? 
SETH The one where they bang the chicks on the bus. Thirteen bucks a month. Total access, live Web Cam feed. The works. It'll be like I'm on the bus, banging them myself. 
EVAN That stuff's bullshit, they're all faking it. And plus, your parents are gonna look at the bill. 
SETH It shows up under a different name. (beat) I hope. Bang Bus. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 2   CONTINUED:                                                         2 SETH (CONT'D) That wouldn't look good. Maybe I should just pick the one with the least dirty sounding name. 
EVAN Weapons of Ass Destruction's out then. 
Seth pulls up in front of a house. 
SETH I could tell my parents I'm doing a project on Rome and I have to research orgies. 
EXT. EVAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Evan walks out his front door. WE REVEAL he is walking towards Seth's car. 
EVAN (still into phone) Yeah. Just tell them your taking a class on blow jobs. 
They both hang up and Evan gets in the car. Seth is about to pull away, when EVAN'S MOTHER comes out the front door. 
EVAN'S MOM Thanks for taking him, Seth. 
Evan changes the radio station. Seth slaps his hand. 
SETH Don't touch that! 
EVAN'S MOM You two are so funny. I can't imagine what you'll do without each other next year. Evan told me you didn't get into State. 
SETH Yeah, you know. I got some other places. Good places. I think we'll be fine. 
EVAN'S MOM Are you going to miss each other? 
EVAN Miss each other? No! 
(CONTINUED) 3   CONTINUED:                                                         3 
SETH That's disgusting. 
MOM Bye, boys. 
Seth and Evan drive off. 
SETH I am truly, truly jealous that you got to suck on those tits when you were a baby. 
EVAN Fuck you, man. 
EXT. CLARK SECONDARY- SOON AFTER 
They drive up to Clark Secondary. There is a giant sign that reads "Seniors - Two Glorious Weeks Until Graduation". Seth turns into the STAFF parking lot. 
INT/EXT. 7-11 STORE - MOMENTS LATER 
Seth and Evan walk past a group of smokers, towards the 7-11. 
EVAN You're being an idiot, man. You really shouldn't park there. 
SETH Fuck it. I'm a senior about to graduate. They should be suckin' my balls. It's the least they can do for stealing three years of my life. 
There are 30 guys standing behind the starting line of the school's track. We hear a TEACHER yell "Go!" and the boys start running. 
We FOLLOW them from above. All the boys keep pretty much the same pace except for one runner who slowly lags behind. The group gets so far ahead of the him that he is alone in the frame. He stops. 
CLOSE UP OF THE RUNNER: 
Kneeling on the track breathing heavily. It's Seth. 
SETH (panting) This...is...bullshit. 
A moment later a KID with prosthetic leg jogs by. 
KID (as he passes Seth) Poo-say. 
INT. CLARK SECONDARY CLASSROOM - DAY 
Evan is sitting in math class staring at HELEN'S breasts. She`s a very tall girl and is athletic in a sexy way, wearing volleyball team sweat pants and a tank top. He looks up from her breasts to her face: she is staring right at him. He immediately looks to the front of the class, embarrassed. 
The bell rings and everyone leaves. Helen walks up to Evan as they enter the hallway. He's really nervous. She offers him a pen. 
HELEN Hey Evan, thanks for the pen. 
EVAN Oh, don't worry, no worries. Just keep it. Then you'll just have it, and you won't have to borrow another pen. 
HELEN Thanks...uh...I was going to ask you, did you hear about Terry's grad party? It's going to be so insane. 
EVAN Yeah, it's a maybe. But, you know, I gotta, I got my... (MORE) (CONTINUED) 8   CONTINUED:                                                     8 EVAN (CONT'D) there's so much other fun shit that is going to be going on that night...so, you know... 
HELEN Fun shit? But I, like, never see you at any parties or anything. 
EVAN Because of all the other fun shit I'm off doing. 
HELEN (playful) Okay. So why weren't you at Dimitri's party on Saturday? 
EVAN Dimitri's? I uh...didn't want to go, because, well, I did other stuff. Saturday... (nervous, he desperately thinks) Oh yeah! Saturday night was awesome! 
(The real version of Evan's story is shown through a montage of quick flashbacks.) 
EVAN (CONT'D) (V.O) First my parents went out to a double feature, so a bunch of people came over... 
INT. EVAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Seth is there. Evan and him are surfing the Bang Bus web site. FOGELL arrives with a bottle of Sambuca. Fogell is one of those seniors who looks like he's thirteen years old. 
EVAN ...and we had a couple drinks in my basement... 
An empty bottle of Sambuca in front of them and empty beer cans at their feet, the three boys each shotgun a beer. 
EVAN (CONT'D) (V.O) ...and Seth's parents were having this cocktail party, and we went over there to, like, mingle... 
INT SETH'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Seth's parents are having a fancy cocktail party. The boys are drunk as hell. 
EVAN ...and there were actually some really interesting and, like, entertaining people there... 
The boys laugh hysterically as they each shake Tobassco Sauce onto their tongues. They writhe around in agony as several adults look at them like they are morons. 
EVAN (CONT'D) (V.O.) ...and, uh, then we saw some, uh, live music. 
INT. SETH'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT 
In Seth's basement, the boys violently wrestle. Evan gives Fogell a bloody nose, but they all can't help but laugh. 
EVAN ...then we went to a club downtown... 
EXT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT 
The bouncer of a dirty strip club rejects them. 
EVAN ...and then we pretty much called it a night and went home... 
INT. TBD HOUSE - NIGHT 
Evan pukes all over Seth. Evan and Fogell laugh hysterically as Seth yells at them. 
INT. CLARK SECONDARY HALLWAY - DAY 
We return to Evan talking to Helen in the halls. 
EVAN ...you would've loved it. 
HELEN That sounds so fun. I would love to go do something like that. 
(CONTINUED) 14   CONTINUED:                                                        14 
EVAN Yeah...well, you know, me and Seth are always cooking up...uh...fun little...events. 
Helen is disappointed in his response. 
SETH (whispering) Dude! She's havin' a fuckin' party. 
ANGLE ON: Fogell entering the room 
SETH (CONT'D) (whispering) Don't tell Fogell about the party. 
FOGELL Hey guys, I was walking here, and on the way, I saw Nicola, and she was wearing these tight white pants and a black g- string and you could see it right through the pants. 
INT. HALLWAY (FLASHBACK) - EARLIER 
We see Fogell, looking at the ass of NICOLA, an incredibly hot girl who exudes sexual vibes and looks a little skanky; you can see her black g-string through her tight white pants. She turns and notices Fogell. He gives an awkward look. 
FOGELL It's nine thirty. 
NICOLA What? 
INT. FOODS AND NUITRITION ROOM (PRESENT) - CONTINUOUS 
Back to Fogell, Seth and Evan. 
FOGELL I told her what time it was. It was awesome. She's got the nicest ass. 
SETH Like you'd know what to do with it. 
FOGELL Ha ha. I'm really gonna miss your knee- slappers when me and Evan are at State. 
SETH (pissed) Yeah, well I'll be at Junior college where the girls are half as smart, and thus twice as likely to blow me. 
FOGELL What are you guys doing tonight? 
(CONTINUED) 18   CONTINUED:                                                        18 
SETH Nothing. Sorry. You'll just have to fingerbang yourself. 
EVAN (to Fogell) What you doing? 
FOGELL Well, Seth always said I was too much of a pussy, but he was wrong. It's been arranged. At lunch, I'm going to the same place Mike Snider went to pick up my brand new false identification card. 
SETH Dude! That's perfect, `cause, Evan, didn't you just say that you heard about a party? 
FOGELL (to Evan) Why didn't you tell me? 
SETH Shut up. Who cares? Just be happy he told. And hey! Now you can buy the booze. 
FOGELL Sounds cool. Cool. 
MRS. GREIR (O.S.) If you're not in this class, leave this class! 
EVAN Well done, man. We'll see you after class. 
Fogell leaves. 
SETH Did you tell that nimrod you're not going to room with him? 
EVAN Uh...no, not yet. 
SETH You better, man. That guy is a poon-tang repellent. 
Seth sees Jules coming. 
(CONTINUED) 18   CONTINUED: (2)                                                18 
JULES Seth, dishes time. What's the hold up? 
SETH We're getting a fake ID. 
JULES Well, you two have four more years to cuddle, so let's get to work. 
EVAN Actually, we're going to different schools. 
JULES Really? You're cutting the cord? What's going to happen? 
SETH Nothing! Jesus. 
EVAN Yeah? What do people think is gonna happen? That's what I don't get. 
SETH We're not, like, dependent on each other. 
EVAN We met when we were 8, we were fine before then. It's not like we do everything together. 
INT. CLARK SECONDARY CAFETERIA - DAY 
Seth and Evan are eating together. 
EVAN So it looks like we get a little graduation party after all. 
SETH I would do terrible things to get with Jules tonight. Terrible things. 
EVAN No shit. I'd give my left foot to start dating Helen. She's killin' me. 
(CONTINUED) 30   CONTINUED:                                                        30 
SETH Hey. Here I am. 
JULES So you're coming to my party, right? It's fully on. 
SETH Yeah. Why? Should I not? 
JULES No, no, no. I really want you to come. But...uh, you did say you were getting a fake ID or something, is that right? 
SETH Very right. Right. I'm getting that. 
SHIRLEY Can you get us drinks? 
SETH Ummm... I don't know. I... think...maybe. 
JULES (half joking) Come on, you scratch our backs, we'll scratch yours. 
SETH Well, funny thing about my back. It's located on my cock. 
Shirley is offended. Jules laughs a little. Seth laughs too hard. 
SETH (CONT'D) Ha! Alright, sure. I can do that. What do you guys want? 
JULES Well, this is actually, like, a big favor, but, well, my parents gave me like a hundred bucks to feed myself for the week, but the house if full of food, so I figure I should just spend all of it on extra drinks for the party. 
SETH Wow. I would never even think of doing something that nice. 
Jules hands Seth a hundred dollars. 
(CONTINUED) 30   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 30 
JULES Well, this is really nice of you. I mean, I really appreciate this. 
Seth can't believe what he's hearing. He can barely contain his smile. 
SETH Should I just get, like, a shitload of different shit? 
JULES Whatever shit you think people would like, I don't really know. 
SHIRLEY I want Mike's Hard Lemonade. 
JULES Okay. I'll see you tonight. 
SETH Yeah! I'll see you! 
The girls walk off, leaving Seth lost in thought. He suddenly runs down the hall. 
EXT. SCHOOL FIELD - MOMENTS LATER 
Evan is standing alone amidst the rest of his gym class as they play soccer. 
GYM TEACHER Evan, get into the game. 
Evan says nothing and the teacher soon redirects his attention elsewhere. Evan sees Seth jogging towards him. 
SETH (out of breath, worked up) Man, just - Evan, listen to me. You know Jules? You know what she just did? She came up to me and asked me if I would buy her alcohol. Not just her, her whole party. Do you know what that means? It means that by some miracle, we were paired up, we talked, and she actually thought of me afterwards. Thought of me enough to decide that I was the guy that she was going to trust the fun-ness of her party with. She wants me! She fucking wants my dick! 
(CONTINUED) 31   CONTINUED:                                                       31 
EVAN Did you ever think maybe she's just using you to get her alcohol? 
SETH Of course I thought of that! LISTEN TO THIS! 
INT. FOODS AND NUITRITION ROOM (FLASHBACK) 
The same scene as before with Seth and Jules in class. 
JULES Yeah! My older brother always eats blue cheese. You know that stuff is actually moldy. 
EXT. SCHOOL FIELD - PRESENT 
SETH She has an older brother! She could have asked him, but she asked me! She looked me straight in the face and asked me. She wants to fuck me, man. Do you understand that? Fucking! Today is the day that fucking has become possible. 
EVAN Are you stupid? You're not going to be able to sleep with her tonight. 
SETH She's going to be at the party, she's gonna be drunk, and she likes me at least a little, so I can get with her. Then, I make her my girlfriend, and then I fuck her all summer long! Then, by the time college rolls around, I'm the fuckin' fucking master, man! 
EVAN Make her your girlfriend? Of course! That's good. So, hypnosis, love potion, or mind-control helmet? 
SETH Once I've gotten with her, I write her love letters, flowers, I'll do anything - I'll be the most pussy-whipped guy in the universe - what chick wouldn't go out with a guy like that? 
(CONTINUED) 33   CONTINUED:                                                       33 
The soccer ball rolls towards them. They both watch as it rolls by. 
CLASSMATE What the hell, Evan? 
Evan shrugs back. 
SETH Yeah! You almost gave me a goddamn heart attack! You better fucking have it, where is it? 
FOGELL I got it. It's flawless! It's great, man, look. 
Fogell reaches into his pocket and pulls out the fake ID. Evan grabs it. 
EVAN (reading the card) Okay Mr..."McLovin"? What kind of a stupid name is that? What are you trying to be, an Irish R&B singer? 
FOGELL Well, they let you pick any name you want when you get there. 
SETH So you picked McLovin? 
FOGELL It was between that or Muhammad. 
SETH Why was it between that or Muhammad? Why didn't you just pick a common name? 
FOGELL Actually, Seth, Muhammad is the most commonly used name on earth. 
EVAN Have you ever actually met a guy named Muhammad? 
FOGELL Have you actually ever met a guy named McLovin? 
SETH No! That's why you picked a bad name. 
(CONTINUED) 37   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 37 
EVAN You probably have federal agents tracking you for even considering the name Muhammad on a fake ID! 
SETH Look at this shit man, you don't even have a first name. It just says "NAME: MCLOVIN" 
EVAN One name? 
FOGELL I just thought McLovin sounded old, and the chicks would dig it. 
EVAN Under what circumstances would you ever have to show a chick your ID? 
FOGELL She could ask. Or, I could just show it to her. 
SETH Holy shit! I don't believe this. This says you're fucking 25! Why didn't you just put 21? 
FOGELL I knew you would ask that. Look, every day, dozens of kids roll into the liquor store with fake ID's trying to act like Joe Casual. Each and every one of these kids just so happens to be 21 years old. Just how many 21 year-olds do you think there are? 
SETH Fool! 
EVAN Calm down! It's not terrible! This might work, but it's up to you, Fogell. They'll either think, "Oh, it's another punk kid with a fake ID." Or, "Look, it's McLovin, the twenty five year-old organ donor". What's it gonna be? 
Fogell takes a deep breath. 
(CONTINUED) 37   CONTINUED: (3)                                                37 
FOGELL I am McLovin. 
SETH You're not McLovin. No one's McLovin and this is never going to work. We need a new way to get alcohol. Could we drive to Canada or something? 
FOGELL I still think it's going to work. 
They walk into the staff parking lot. Seth stops. 
SETH What the fuck? Where's my car? 
EVAN I told you, man! What did I say? I told you that was a dumb idea. 
FOGELL Why would you park in the staff- 
SETH Shut up, Fogell. 
FOGELL `Cause you're not staff. 
SETH I am aware of that, Fagell. 
Seth storms off. Evan follows him. 
FOGELL (yelling) Will you still pick me up from work? 
Evan and Seth round the corner, leaving Fogell behind. 
SETH Let's go to your house. 
INT. EVAN'S BEDROOM - SOON AFTER 
Seth puts on a shirt that is way too small and he's wearing pants that are too tight. Evan is playing the video game Grand Theft Auto. 
(CONTINUED) 38   CONTINUED:                                                        38 
SETH Now we wait for your Mom to piss off and steal your parents' booze like your brother always does. Take a bit from every bottle. Piece of cake. It's not exactly what Jules wanted, but it'll do, right? 
EVAN Come on! Just wear what you wore to school. 
SETH I told you I can't do that. I can't let Jules see me in the same shit I wore at school. It's completely unbecoming. 
SETH It's like me making my nuts saggier. 
Evan sees something in the distance. 
EVAN Whoa. What's this? 
SETH What? 
(CONTINUED) 58   CONTINUED:                                                        58 
EVAN Check it out! The cops! 
They see a cop car with the lights flashing parked outside the liquor store. Seth and Evan cautiously approach the liquor store and look inside. They see two POLICE talking with the Cashier, and Fogell is standing right beside them! 
EVAN (CONT'D) Shit! They busted Fogell! 
INT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS 
The two police, OFFICER SLATER, 30 and experienced, and OFFICER MICHAELS, 25 and learning, are talking to the Cashier. Fogell stands beside them, nervous and afraid. 
OFFICER SLATER (to cashier) So, did he punch anyone else? 
CASHIER (losing it completely) I can't do this, okay!?! I told you, I have an exam tomorrow! Can you understand that? A goddamn exam! 
The cashier breaks down crying and walks off to the back of the store. The officers look at each other. 
OFFICER MICHAELS Apparently, she has an exam. 
They chuckle. Then they turn to Fogell. 
OFFICER SLATER (turn to Fogell) So then, son, you're the one that got punched? 
Fogell looks down to his bags of liquor at his feet. Then back at the cops. He nods. 
OFFICER MICHAELS We'd like to ask you a couple questions. 
The officers each take out a note pad and a pencil. 
OFFICER MICHAELS (CONT'D) Okay, first things first. What's your name? 
(CONTINUED) 59   CONTINUED:                                                      59 
Fogell looks like his heart is about to explode out of his chest. 
FOGELL My name, it's...it's.. (tripping over his own words) Mc..mac..laddle... 
OFFICER SLATER MicMac what? 
FOGELL No, no I said, "McLovin". 
OFFICER MICHAELS McLovin? 
FOGELL McLovin. 
The officers both write down some information. 
OFFICER SLATER Cool name. And your first name? 
Fogell looks twice as scared. 
FOGELL Oh...that's uh...a good one...it's a...an interesting...uh...event... 
Fogell trails off mumbling and starts to breathe heavily, making an ODD NOISE. Behind him, in the window of the store, we see Seth and Evan peeking through. 
EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS 
Shocked, Seth and Evan walk away from the window. Seth starts to pace in anger. 
SETH I don't believe this bullshit! I can't...this isn't happening! I didn't even know you could get arrested for this shit! WE NEED THAT FUCKING LIQUOR! 
EVAN Oh my god. Are they gonna take him downtown? 
SETH Fuck Fogell! He got arrested! We're on our own. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 60   CONTINUED:                                                        60 SETH (CONT'D) We need a new way of getting liquor. (realizing) AAAHHH!! The money! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! How much money can you get? 
EVAN What are you talking about? Money? What about Fogell? 
SETH That doesn't matter anymore. I just lost a hundred dollars of Jules' money! 
EVAN We have to help him! 
SETH Help him? What are we gonna do? Bust him out of jail? I don't even know where jail is! What we need is the alcohol, which is impossible because we don't have any fucking money! 
Seth steps into the driveway leading to the parking lot. 
EVAN Fine. Just...calm down. We need to think. We need to think. 
SETH Fuck thinking! We need to act! 
Suddenly, a car pulls out of the lot going 10 mph and knocks Seth down!!! 
(CONTINUED) 70   CONTINUED:                                                        70 
SETH Then why haven't you ever made a move, you pussy? 
EVAN Because I respect her! I'm not going to put that kind of unfair pressure on her. 
SETH These aren't girls, they're women! They need our dicks as much as we need their poons - and we all love liquor, so where's the fucking beef?! 
EVAN We're leaving, okay? These guys could kill us. You want to get killed for liquor? 
SETH You're really gonna bail on me?! 
EVAN (rolls eyes) Jesus... 
Evan walks out the door. 
SETH Okay, okay...if that's how you're going to be, then I'll get the booze on my own. And you're not getting any. And neither is Helen! 
Seth storms off. 
INT. COP CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Fogell sits in the backseat. The cops are in the front. There is silence for a few beats. 
FOGELL Um...hey...uh, officers. I could answer those, uh, questions now if you want. 
OFFICER SLATER We get the gist of it. You were buying some beer, some guys came in and robbed the place. I don't think we're gonna find `em this time. 
The officers start to chuckle. 
(CONTINUED) 71   CONTINUED:                                                        71 
FOGELL It was only one guy. 
OFFICER SLATER Only one guy? Well, fuck that. We could never catch one guy. 
OFFICER MICHAELS You see, McLovin, if it was two guys, we'd have twice the chance of catching one of them. But just one guy? I mean, how are we supposed to find one guy in this whole city? 
OFFICER SLATER Yeah, McLovin. You know how many people there are in this city? I have trouble finding people I know. 
FOGELL Aren't you guys supposed to be trained or something? Don't you have a computer? 
OFFICER SLATER Yeah, that stuff can help, but if someone walks up to me on the street, and is like, "Hey, find Bob." Well, how the hell am I supposed to do that? 
FOGELL Who's Bob? 
OFFICER SLATER Exactly. If I don't know who he is, then how am I supposed to know where he is? 
OFFICER MICHAELS When you're new to the force, like I am- 
OFFICER SLATER Only six months in. (proudly) I got two and a half years under my belt. 
OFFICER MICHAELS You learn a lot of crazy stuff. For example- 
The car radio goes off. 
(CONTINUED) 71   CONTINUED: (2)                                                71 
RADIO We have a 245 at East 24 and Montgomery. It's Bailey's Bar and Grill. Car 43, respond please. 
Slater picks up the receiver. 
OFFICER SLATER Ten-four. (hangs up) Nice. Ya see, Michaels, when ever there's a call for a bar, you take it. 
OFFICER MICHAELS Good fucking call, sir. 
They chuckle. 
OFFICER SLATER Hey, McLovin. We got a situation at Bailey's. We have to see to that, but we'll drop you off right after. Okay? 
FOGELL Um...okay... 
Michael's hits the siren and they drive off. 
INT. HOUSE PARTY- KITCHEN. - CONTINUOUS 
Seth is looking in the fridge, which is full of beer. An ENORMOUS GUY nudges Seth aside and sticks his arm in. 
ENORMOUS GUY Hey Mark, you want another beer? 
Seth quickly walks away from the fridge and goes down the hall. 
INT HOUSE PARTY - DANCING ROOM 
Seth enters a room of people dancing to hip-hop. He notices all the girls are drinking Mike's Hard Lemonade, and then locates a cooler full of it across the dance area. 
He tries to make his way through the sea of dancing. A hot, sorority-type WOMAN drunk out off her ass dances over to him and starts grinding against his leg. He doesn't know how to react so he just goes with it, bumpin' and grindin' with the girl. 
EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 
An R&B slow jam plays as an exuberant Seth, a Mike's Hard Lemonade in one hand and the Woman's ass in the other as the dancing becomes increasingly sexual. As the song ends, the Woman moves on. 
Seth glances at the cooler and sees one more Mike's hard. He grabs it and puts it in his pocket. The bulge is apparent. 
Extremely pleased with himself, 
INT. HOUSE PARTY - ADJACENT ROOM 
Seth walks into the adjacent room. There are a bunch of GUYS chilling on the couch, who all look at Seth oddly as he enters. 
SETH Hey, wut up? 
The guys just nod at Seth and continue to look at him strangely. 
GUY 1 What is that? Is that red wine? 
(CONTINUED) 79   CONTINUED:                                                        79 
Thinking he's busted, Seth quickly covers the bulge in his pocket. 
SETH Uh...no. What? I don't know what you're talking about. 
GUY 1 That shit you spilled all over yourself, idiot. 
SETH (sincere) I didn't spill anything on myself. 
Seth checks himself to see what the guy is referring to. 
SETH (CONT'D) Oh shit. 
On Seth's upper thigh there is a red splotch about the size of a palm of a hand. 
SETH (CONT'D) What the hell is this? 
GUY 1 Oh my lord. You were just dancing in there, right? 
SETH Yeah, so? 
The guys all burst out laughing. 
GUY 1 It's fucking blood. 
SETH Why would I get blood on my leg from--- (beat of realization) OH SHIT! 
The guys start laughing even harder. 
SETH (CONT'D) Some girl perioded on my fucking leg! 
GUY 2 I've never seen that before in my life. 
Seth pokes at the splotch. 
(CONTINUED) 79   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 79 
SETH That is disgusting. 
Guy 1 gets up as Seth tries to cover up the mess with his shirt. 
GUY 1 I gotta show this to Bill. 
SETH Who's Bill? Don't show Bill! No! I can't believe this is happening! 
GUY 2 We should find who did it. 
SETH This is un-fucking-believable. I have to look good tonight! 
GUY 2 Who'd you dance with? 
SETH Who gives a shit? Fuck! These aren't even my pants! 
INT. HOUSE PARTY- ANOTHER ROOM 
Guy 1 brings six more guys, including the Enormous Guy, into the room. He points out the stain Seth's pants. All the guys burst out laughing. Embarrassed and fearful of the attention, Seth starts making his way out of the room. 
SETH Yeah. It's really funny, huh? Yuk it up, assholes. 
Seth works his way through another room full of people, shielding the splotch as best as he can. 
PARTY DUDE Dude! Check it out! That guy's having his period! 
Another group of people turn and laugh. 
PARTY GIRL He looks about the right age! 
SETH (to himself) I gotta clean this shit. 
(CONTINUED) 80   CONTINUED:                                                        80 
He sees a long line of people standing if front of the bathroom door. He spots a staircase and runs down into the basement. 
INT. HOUSE PARTY BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Seth is scrubbing at the mark on his thigh, but it's not doing much. He stops for a moment to take a breather as he looks around the basement. 
He spots a fridge in the corner and walks over to it. As he opens it, a look of awe sweeps across his face. Every shelf is completely filled with beer. 
SETH Jesus's tits! 
He grabs as many bottles as he can and starts sticking them in his pockets, when he notices two large jugs of detergent next to the washer. He thinks for a moment, then begins to empty out the detergent jugs. 
INT. HOUSE PARTY - CONTINUOUS 
Evan peers into a vacant room and sees a telephone. He nervously enters and picks up the phone. He dials. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS 
Helen is in a cab with BECCA, her best-friend, and two other girls. They're a little done up and really giggly. Helen's cell phone starts ringing. She hushes the other girls as she answers her phone. 
HELEN Hello? 
BECCA Is it him? 
HELEN (whispering to the girls) Shut up. 
EVAN Hey! Helen. Hi. I had bad reception. Are you at the party? 
HELEN No, I'm in a cab. I'll be there soon. Are you still coming? 
EVAN Yeah, definitely. Um, about your Goldschlager... 
(CONTINUED) 86   CONTINUED:                                                     86 
Evan can hear all the girls goofing around and giggling. 
HELEN (whispering to the girls) Shut up. 
EVAN What's going on there? 
HELEN Oh, nothing, I just wanted to make sure you were still coming, you know, and that you didn't get caught up at a cocktail party or some club. 
EVAN Nope. I'm gonna be there. 
HELEN Well, I can't wait to see you. 
EVAN I think it's going to be a real fun...event. 
HELEN Okay. Bye. 
INT. HOUSE PARTY VACANT ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Evan hangs up the phone. A huge smile crosses his face. As he turns around to exit, five older, unbelievably drunk DUDES wander into the room. 
DUDE 1 They're going to kill that guy, man. That bitch's boyfriend is so pissed. 
DUDE 2 Yeah. And he's a beast. 
They start pouring a baggy of coke on the table when one of them notices Evan standing in the corner. 
DUDE 3 Hey! Was it you? Are you the guy? The kid with the splotch on his crotch? 
Evan glances down at his crotch. He is confused and horrified. 
EVAN No. What splotch- 
(CONTINUED) 87   CONTINUED:                                                        87 
DUDE 2 I know you! Guys! I know that guy, he was at that party with me. 
DUDE 4 Who's he? 
DUDE 2 He's Jimmy's brother. The dude with the crazy raps, the one I told you about! 
They draw the coke into lines as Evan slowly heads for the door. 
EVAN Oh no, that's not me either. Wrong guy, man. Sorry. 
Dude 3 gets up and blocks the door. 
DUDE 3 No. No, that's you, man. You are fully Jimmy's brother! You were just so messed up you can't remember. 
EVAN Trust me, man. That wasn't me. I don't even listen to rap. 
DUDE 3 It was you! I know it! Come on! Rap! I've been telling these guys about you. Just give them one rap. Come on. Rap. Rap. 
They start doing the lines of coke. Evan is very afraid. 
INT. HOUSE PARTY BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER 
ANGLE ON: Seth, cowering in the corner 
Mark runs at Seth and is about to punch him, when suddenly Dude 1 tackles him onto the kitchen island! Seth turns and faces Mark's girlfriend, JACINDA. 
JACINDA You motherfucker! 
She grabs a lamp, still plugged in, and swings it at Seth. She hits him square in the chest and the light bulb explodes! 
SETH AHH!!! 
JACINDA You ruined my birthday!!! You humiliated me!!! 
SETH You're the one who used my leg as a tampon! 
She charges at him again, arms flailing. Seth scurries around the room, shielding the blows with the detergent bottles. 
Evan throws the Enormous Guy to the ground and runs. Evan backs off, spots Seth, and follows him out of the party. 
EXT HOUSE PARTY 
As Seth and Evan run up the block together, Jacinda talks into her cell phone. 
JACINDA Yeah, Fifth and Paysview, please hurry! 
EXT. DARK STREET - CONTINUOUS 
The cops and Fogell stand beside the car. The Homeless Guy is sleeping in the back. Michaels has his gun drawn and is carefully aiming at a distant stop sign. 
OFFICER SLATER You've been saying some bold words, my friend. Better not mess up. 
FOGELL You can do it, officer. 
BLAM!!! Michaels blasts off a round, which punches a hole right through the center of the "O" in the stop sign. 
OFFICER MICHAELS Boo-yaka-sha!!! Suck it, Slater. Suck my nuts. Long, but gentle. 
FOGELL Yeah! And eat his ass! 
They all laugh hysterically. 
FOGELL (CONT'D) Can I shoot one? 
The cops look at each other and shrug. 
OFFICER SLATER Yeah. Sure. Here. Go nuts. 
Slater hands Fogell the gun, when suddenly a SIREN can be heard in the distance getting closer. 
OFFICER MICHAELS Fuck. The cops! 
OFFICER SLATER Let's bail! Shotgun! 
Slater grabs the gun out of the disappointed Fogell's hand and holsters it. They all hop into the car. 
INT. COP CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Michaels kicks it into drive and they peel out. Fogell shoves the unconscious Homeless Guy over. 
OFFICER MICHAELS Hah, hah! Eat it. So, dudes, what do we do now? 
Suddenly, the car radio goes off. 
RADIO We got a 257 at Fifth and Paysview, all units in the area report to Fifth and Paysview. Car 98. That's you. Do it. Seriously. 
The cops stop and listen. 
OFFICER MICHAELS Son-of-a-bitch. (picks up radio) Car 98, ten-four. (hangs up) Ya dumb whore. Ha! 
FOGELL What does that mean? We gonna get to shoot anyone? 
OFFICER SLATER I wish. Probably some lame house party. We'll drop you off after. Cool? 
FOGELL Yeah, man. Let's show these fuckers how we roll. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MOMENTS LATER 
Seth and Evan are running down the sidewalk. They both slow to a stop to catch their breath. The party is nowhere in sight. 
SETH (wheezing heavily) ...huff...hufff...you fuckin' prick... 
EVAN What? 
SETH You...huff...bailed on me...huff...man. 
(CONTINUED) 95   CONTINUED:                                                        95 
EVAN No I didn't! 
SETH Of course you did! We were supposed to do something and you left instead of doing it! That's the definition of bailing! 
OFFICER MICHAELS Oh shit. Shit, shit, SHIT! 
OFFICER SLATER I don't believe this is happening again. 
FOGELL (frightened) Oh my god...is he...are you gonna make sure he's alright? 
OFFICER SLATER Okay, okay, we're gonna get out of the car now. McLovin, you stay right there. 
OFFICER MICHAELS That guy better not be dead. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - CONTINUOUS 
The cops get out of the car and walk over to a now sitting up Seth. He's dazed, but okay. 
EVAN I'm sorry! You pushed me first. 
SETH I didn't push you into fucking oncoming traffic! 
The boys notice the cops. 
OFFICER MICHAELS Is everyone alright? 
SETH (sarcastic) We're great. 
OFFICER SLATER Well, you should be careful boys. That's how accidents happen. 
SETH What, when cops drive like maniacs and hop the fucking curb? 
OFFICER SLATER (intimidating) Pardon? 
EVAN Nothing. 
(CONTINUED) 101   CONTINUED:                                                       101 
Evan looks like he's about to shit himself. The cops notice one of the detergent jugs in the middle of a puddle of beer. Slater dips his finger in rubs it against his gums like it was cocaine. 
OFFICER SLATER Pabst. You boys been doing a bit of drinking? 
EVAN No officer. Not at all. 
OFFICER SLATER (pointing to the other jug) Is that more beer you got over there? 
SETH Umm, no sir, detergent. 
OFFICER MICHAELS Detergent? 
SETH My clothes are dirty. 
The cops look at each other, then at the boys. 
OFFICER MICHAELS You boys stay right here. 
INT. COP CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Fogell anxiously sits in the cop car. He can't see what's going on through the shattered windshield. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - CONTINUOUS 
The cops turn away and start to whisper to one another. Seth and Evan look on, nervous. 
OFFICER SLATER Alright, Michaels. The car is completely fucked, and you're the one who fucked it up, so you've got to fix it. 
OFFICER MICHAELS What do I do? 
OFFICER SLATER We arrest these little crap stains and dump it on them, I'll take care of that. You go make sure McLovin is good to play ball. This is it, Michaels. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 103   CONTINUED:                                                    103 OFFICER SLATER (CONT'D) You wanna hang with the big boys, you gotta get your hands dirty. You cool? 
OFFICER MICHAELS Yeah, I'm cool. 
The cops nod to each other. Michaels goes back to the car and gets in. Slater walks back over to the boys. He puts his hand on his gun and pulls out his club, scaring the shit out of Evan and Seth. 
OFFICER SLATER Get on the ground. Now! Spread your shit! 
Evan and Seth lie down on their stomachs and spread their arms and legs out, terrified. 
EVAN Puh...please don't shoot. 
OFFICER SLATER (mocking) Puh- Puh- Please shut the fuck up! 
INT. COP CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Officer Michaels is sitting in the driver's seat. 
FOGELL Was the guy alright? 
OFFICER MICHAELS What? Oh, yeah, the guy was fine. 
Michaels looks back at the Homeless Guy, who looks a little bit more awake than before. 
OFFICER MICHAELS (CONT'D) Are you awake, sir? 
A little GIRL runs out and books it into the house. From inside the tent, another kid starts kicking at Seth. 
SETH Ow! 
Seth manages to free himself from the tent and he and Fogell fall to the ground. The kids continue to scream. 
FATHER(O.S.) Get away from my children! 
The guys turn and see a crazed, slightly overweight FATHER in his underwear running at them with a baseball bat. Fogell and Seth scramble to their feet as the Dad takes a swing at them, narrowly missing them. 
FATHER(CONT'D) You sick sons-of-bitches! 
Fogell throws his shoulder into the guy, knocking him down. Seth and Fogell run to the backyard gate and try to open it. They can't. 
FOGELL Help! 
Fogell starts banging as Seth looks back to see the Dad coming for them. Seth swings the detergent jug at the Father, knocking him on his ass. He quickly gets up and charges, enraged. 
(CONTINUED) 109   CONTINUED: (2)                                                109 
FOGELL (CONT'D) Aaaahhh!!!! 
Fogell gets the door open and the two boys run into the alley. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 
They sprint down the alley. Seth coughs and wheezes, slowing down as he lugs the detergent. The Father enters the alley and sees the boys running. He throws his baseball bat. It sails through the air and nails Seth in the back! He falls. 
SETH ARGGG! 
He gets up and the keeps running. 
EXT. STREET CORNER - CONTINUOUS 
Slater and Michaels, completely out of breath, desperately scan the area for the boys. 
OFFICER SLATER Stupid little bastards. 
OFFICER MICHAELS Maybe I should fire a shot? Scare `em out? 
EXT. INSIDE SOME BUSHES - CONTINUOUS 
Evan is nestled inside a large bush, frantically trying to reverse his clothes so as to disguise himself. He keeps looking out for the cops, when suddenly he hears a gunshot - BLAM!!! 
EVAN (to himself, mumbling) Oh god. Oh god. Fuck. Fuck. 
As he fumbles to turn his jacket inside out and get it on, he sees Seth and Fogell running towards him. He pops out of the bush, scaring Fogell and Seth. 
FOGELL                           SETH Ahh!                              Jesus! 
EVAN (CONT'D) Should I run!?!

SETH Fucking run! 
They all run off down the street. 
EXT MAIN STREET 
They turn a corner at the end of the block and continue running. 
They turn onto a main street and are exuberant at the sight of an oncoming bus. It stops at a nearby stop. They haul ass and make it on. 
INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS 
Out of breath, the boys dig up change and put it in the toll box, then walk towards the back of the bus. 
HOMELESS GUY (O.S.) Hey! It's you! 
Fogell looks up and sees the Homeless Guy stumbling towards them, sucking back the bottom of the lost detergent bottle. The Homeless Guy sees they have bags full of booze. 
HOMELESS GUY (CONT'D) You got booze in the bag? Can you gimme some? 
SETH No! Fuck off! You already drank our detergent beer! 
HOMELESS GUY That was beer?! (to Fogell) Well, you little shit...ain't got no cop people to help you keep your booze...gimme it... 
The Homeless Nutcase reaches for the booze. Seth steps in front of him. 
SETH Back off, or we'll kick the shit out of you! 
EVAN We can't do that. He's homeless.

SETH So? Who cares? Just because he doesn't have a home doesn't mean he can be a lunatic! 
The party is in full swing. There is loud music blaring and nearly a hundred people talking, dancing, and smoking. 
JULES Seth! Everyone, he's here! He's got it! 
Everyone turns around and sees the Seth holding all the liquor. 
RANDOM GUY He's got a shit load of booze!!! 
(CONTINUED) 117   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 117 
Everyone starts cheering! Seth sets it out on the kitchen table; it is an impressive array of inebriates. 
SETH The bar is open! 
EVERYONE (ecstatically cheering) Yeah Seth!/Clutch!/Nice!/I can't believe it!/Seth did that?!/ Who the fuck is Seth? 
In the background, we see Evan and Fogell wander into the party as Jules approaches Seth. 
JULES This is awesome. Thank you so much. 
SETH Sorry it was late. 
JULES Yeah. To be honest, people were starting to get seriously pissed off. Listen, I've got to go tell everyone the drinks are here. Don't go anywhere. Promise? 
SETH I'll be right here. 
Jules walks off. 
INT. JULES' KITCHEN   - MOMENTS LATER 
Tons of kids pour themselves drinks. Seth and about six other kids all have overflowing shots of Jaeger. 
SETH To Jules! 
Everyone drinks and recoils from the taste. A random guy refills everyone's shot glasses. 
RANDOM   GUY (pointing to   Seth) Another one, but   to you, man! Everyone, to this guy! Who   the fuck are you, man? 
SETH (exuberant) Seth!

SETH Hey! Let's do another one to me! 
Everyone laughs as Seth, very pleased with himself, starts refilling shot glasses. 
EXT. JULES BACKPORCH - CONTINUOUS 
Evan walks out onto the back porch, looking for Helen. He sees Becca. 
EVAN Becca! Hey. 
BECCA Where have you been, you almost blew it. 
EVAN What? 
BECCA Helen. She's been waiting for you. She's right over there. She's been yammering about you all night. 
EVAN What? What did she say? Does she think I'm a good guy? What did she say? 
BECCA It was something like, "I'll fully blow him tonight." 
EVAN What?!? 
Evan looks over and sees Helen standing on the balcony with a big group of people. He gets really nervous. 
EVAN (CONT'D) Oh man. This is too much. Oh god. What do I do? I lost the Goldschlager I was supposed to bring her! 
(CONTINUED) 120   CONTINUED:                                                       120 
BECCA Well, Jordana stole a bottle of tequila from her parents and her and Helen have been going at it. I think she'll be fine in that department. I'd just go over there and invite her upstairs, pronto. 
EVAN What? Oh man... (so nervous) But...she's totally hammered. If I get with her, and I'm not drunk, isn't that, like, date rape? 
BECCA It's not date rape if you're drunk, too. 
EVAN I guess. 
Evan looks at Helen and takes a deep breath. 
INT. JULES BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Evan enters the bathroom and slams the door shut, a bottle of Ouzo in one hand and a beer in the other. He looks at himself in the mirror, seeming as though he's on the verge of a full- on panic attack. 
HELEN (CONT'D) I've been waiting for you for, like, ever. What took you so long? Do you have my Goldschlager? 
EVAN Oh man, it's a crazy story- 
Helen picks up a bottle of tequila and shoves it into Evan's hand. 
HELEN Here! Don't worry, we can drink this. 
EVAN I'm already pretty wasted. But...uh...here's to you. 
Evan takes a much-unwanted drink and gags. 
HELEN Light-weight! 
Everyone laughs. 
HELEN (CONT'D) Hey...me and you should go upstairs now. I really want to...tell you something. 
EVAN (confused and drunk) Uh...uh...uh...you could just tell me right here- 
HELEN (laughing) No! Let's go upstairs, come on! 
(CONTINUED) 129   CONTINUED: (2)                                               129 
Evan hears everyone giggle as Helen pulls him towards the house. Helen trips, just managing not to fall. 
HELEN (CONT'D) Careful... 
INT. JULES' DINING ROOM WITH DANCING PEOPLE - CONTINUOUS 
Nicola and Fogell are standing in the corner of the room. Nicola is looking at Fogell's ID. 
NICOLA McLovin! That's the funniest thing I've ever seen! 
FOGELL Yeah, I just thought it sounded old. 
They both laugh and their eyes meet. 
INT. JULES KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
The party is in full swing and everyone is getting good and drunk. Jules walks up to Seth, who is clearly piss drunk. 
JULES Hey, I'm back. I had to thank the peeps for comin' out. 
SETH (really, really, drunk) Jules! The hostess with the most-est! The woman of the hour! 
Seth takes a swig of a beer. 
SETH (CONT'D) This party's blowin' my ass off! I want you to have a drink with me. 
Seth offers her a beer. 
JULES No, thanks. I'm good. But, seriously, thanks for getting all the drinks. It really made the night. 
SETH It's just how I roll, Jules. No problems, no problems. 
Jules laughs and Seth sees that his charm is working. 
(CONTINUED) 131   CONTINUED:                                                      131 
SETH (CONT'D) Uh...you know...I love talking, and conversing with you, you're so good at it, but I can't hear you. Could we just go on the...uh...balcony or something? 
Jules eyes Seth suspiciously. Seth just looks at her, smiling drunkenly. 
JULES Why not? I haven't conversed in ages. Let's do it. 
Jules walks out of the kitchen. He finishes off his beer and then, happy as shit, drunkenly dances out of the kitchen and after Jules. 
INT. JULES' BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Evan practically holds Helen up, almost dropping her several times, as they stumble into Jules' bedroom. Helen puts down the tequila and starts kissing Evan, but it's not nice kissing, it's sloppy porno kissing with way too much tongue. After a few moments Evan pulls away and looks at the remarkably drunk Helen. 
EVAN Are you okay? 
HELEN I so flirt with you in Math. 
EVAN Oh man. Helen...I want to tell you, I mean, I've wanted to tell you, for a long time- 
HELEN I know. I've wanted to get with you so hard. 
Helen kisses him. 
HELEN (CONT'D) Like...so hard. 
Helen yanks him onto the bed and starts sloppily kissing him again. Evan doesn't know what to do. She tries to take off Evan's shirt, but is way too inebriated to undo the buttons. Evan yanks it off. 
HELEN (CONT'D) Good... 
(CONTINUED) 132   CONTINUED:                                                    132 
RANDOM GIRL (yelling into the house) Hey, Ricky! Was it a quarter, or an eighth you want? 
RICKY (O.S.) A fat eighth! 
The Random Girl notices Seth and Jules. 
(CONTINUED) 134   CONTINUED: (2)                                                134 
RANDOM GIRL Whoa. Sorry. 
The girl hops down the stairs and walks off as Jules stares at the sobbing Seth. 
INT. JULES' ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Evan sitting on the bed in only his boxers, and Helen is just getting her pants off, leaving her only in her lingerie. Evan's eyes widen. She looks at Evan and rubs her breasts in a very un-sexy way. 
HELEN I wore this for you. Here we go... 
Helen crawls onto the bed, pushes Evan down, and starts seriously making out with him, drunker and sloppier than ever. 
HELEN (CONT'D) Evan, I'm so wet. 
EVAN (still nervous) You're so beautiful. 
Helen shoves her hand down Evan's boxers. Evan jolts, terrified! 
HELEN You've got such a smooth cock. 
EVAN Um...thank you. I've thought you were a really incredible person for a really long time. 
Evan looks really nervous as Helen's hand starts moving up and down. 
HELEN You've got to get hard for me...real hard. 
EVAN I'm...I'm..I'm about to. But first I just want to tell you exactly how I- 
HELEN I'm gonna suck your dick so good. 
Evan is taken aback. 
(CONTINUED) 135   CONTINUED:                                                       135 
EVAN You don't have to do that, you know, we can start this relationship on something more than just that. 
HELEN Yeah, Evan. I know. (in a sultry, whispery voice) I need you to eat my hairy love crack. 
EVAN Jesus Christ. 
Evan sits up. 
HELEN What's wrong? 
Beat. 
EVAN You don't want to do this. 
HELEN Yeah I do, I want to fuck you. 
EVAN Look, you know I really like you, Helen, but this is...it's just too intense. And I'm so drunk I don't even know how to, like, process- 
HELEN You're just being a pussy. 
EVAN What? Did you just call me a...pussy? 
HELEN Yeah...a scared little pussy- 
PUKE! Evan watches in horror as Helen vomits all over Jules' bed. 
EVAN Oh god! Oh... 
HELEN I need Becca...Becca... 
EVAN I'll...uh...I'll go get her. Are you going to be okay? 
(CONTINUED) 135   CONTINUED: (2)                                               135 
HELEN Oh God, oh God, oh...I'm puking...

INT. JULES PARENTS'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Fogell is laying on his back on the bed and Nicola is straddling him. They are kissing. Nicola sits up and takes Fogell's hand and starts sucking his fingers. 
FOGELL I've got a boner. 
NICOLA Good. Do you have a condom? 
He pulls a condom out. 
Fogell is on top of Nicola in the missionary position. 
NICOLA Oh...uh...oh... 
(CONTINUED) 140   CONTINUED:                                                       140 
FOGELL It's...it's in. (beat) It's in. 
Fogell wears the greatest look of accomplishment one could possibly imagine. 
SUDDENLY, Officer Michaels bursts into the room and flicks on the lights. 
FOGELL (CONT'D) What the hell? 
Nicola screams, grabs her clothes, and runs into the bathroom. 
OFFICER SLATER McLovin? What the fuck? 
FOGELL Officer Slater? 
OFFICER SLATER You ran away from us! (turns to the door) Michaels! Get up here! 
FOGELL No! I hit my head when we crashed. I was all disoriented and I just wandered off, confused. Seriously! 
OFFICER MICHAELS Shut the fuck up! Wait a minute. How old was that girl? 16, 17? You sick bastard, that's statutory rape, McLovin. 
Officer Slater appears in the doorway. 
OFFICER SLATER McLovin! 
OFFICER MICHAELS He was violating a sixteen year-old girl! 
FOGELL What? No! No! 
Fogell covers himself with the blanket and starts to get up. 
(CONTINUED) 140   CONTINUED: (2)                                                140 
FOGELL (CONT'D) I didn't break the law! I'm not really even- 
OFFICER MICHAELS Sit your ass down and keep it down. 
OFFICER SLATER You're going to jail, fucko. 
Nicola, now dressed, emerges from the bathroom. She screams and runs out. They take Fogell's arms and handcuff him. 
OFFICER SLATER (CONT'D) (to Fogell) They don't take kindly to your type in jail, McLovin. 
EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 
Drunk, joyful, and out of breath, the boys stop running. 
EVAN Dude. You saved me! 
SETH I totally did! I wanted to! 
EVAN Wanna sleep at my house, man? You're my best friend! 
SETH Yeah! Sleepover! Fuckin...you got pizza bagels still? 
EVAN Yeah!!!! Look what else I gots! 
Evan pulls a half bottle of tequila. 
SETH Nice! 
They start to drink it together. 
EXT. JULES' FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS 
All the kids from the party have congregated in the front yard. The cop car is parked right in front. We see the Officers dragging Fogell through the crowd of kids. 
(CONTINUED) 142   CONTINUED:                                                       142 
TERRY (O.S.) Stupid pigs. 
SUDDENLY, a WAD OF SPIT hits Slater in the shoulder! He turns and sees Terry, the guy who spat on Seth. Slater walks over and bashes the kid in the face with his nightstick. The kid drops. 
OFFICER SLATER There you go. 
OFFICER MICHAELS That does feel better. 
They throw Fogell into the back of the cop car. 
INT. COP CAR - CONTINUOUS 
The cops both get in and slam their doors. They just stare forward. 
FOGELL So...am I going to jail? 
EVAN (CONT'D) And then you saved me, man! I fucking love you! 
SETH I fucking love you, too, man! I'm not embarrassed, I just love you! 
EVAN Why don't we say that more? It feels good! I love you more than my brother, man. Like, when you went away for Easter last year, I, like, missed you. You know? 
SETH I missed you, too. Come here, man. 
Seth grabs Evan and they hug. 
SETH (CONT'D) We'll always be friends. `Cause we love each other. 
They stop hugging and sit back down. They're laughter slows down and there is a moment of silence. 
SETH (CONT'D) Like, three weeks ago I was in you room and, like, you were taking a dump and...I saw your residence placement thingy. I totally saw you're living with Fogell. So, like- 
EVAN I'm sorry, man. 
SETH Don't be! Don't be! I'm sorry. I was being a bitch. 
EVAN I need you to know that it's not like I even want to live with Fogell; it's just that I'm really afraid of living with strangers. 
There is a moment of silence. 
(CONTINUED) 147   CONTINUED: (2)                                                147 
SETH You know...I was pissed off I didn't get with Jules, but, like...we really got through a lot of our shit, you know? 
EVAN Yeah, me too. Like, yeah...at least we kind of came together, again. 
Beat. 
EVAN (CONT'D) Good night, Seth. I love you. 
SETH Night, Evan. Love you, man. 
INT. EVAN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - THE NEXT MORNING 
Evan wakes up and looks over at Seth, who is also waking. They look at each other extremely awkwardly, almost as though they drunkenly had sex with each other last night. 
EVAN Oh...uh...hey. Morning. 
SETH Uh...morning. 
They stare at each other, uncomfortable. 
EVAN You sleep good? 
SETH Yeah. This is a really good pillow. 
EVAN Um... 
Seth looks at his watch. 
SETH Maybe I should get going. 
EVAN You don't have to. I'm not, like, doing anything. 
Beat. 
(CONTINUED) 148   CONTINUED:                                                       148 
SETH Oh...do you want to hang out? I was...gonna go to the mall, actually. 
EVAN Oh. Cool, well, can I come? I need a comforter. For college. 
SETH Yeah. That'd be nice. I'd really like that. 
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NEXT DAY 
Evan is standing in the pants section of a department store. Seth walks out of the dressing room wearing jeans that are way too small. 
EVAN Don't ask me. I don't give a shit if your pants look good. 
SETH Well, I need someone's opinion. 
EVAN Fine. They're way too small. 
SETH Yeah, but when I was wearing your dad's pants last night I realized that if I buy pants that are too small it'll encourage me to lose weight. And in tight pants chicks'll kind of see my dick a little. 
EVAN Yeah, the male camel toe look is really big this year. 
Seth goes back into the dressing room and wriggles out of the pants. He walks out. 
SETH These pants suck. Let's the get the fuck out of here. 
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE 
They walk through the department store, when suddenly, Evan sees Helen and Jules looking at comforters.

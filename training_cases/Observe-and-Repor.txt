OBSERVE AND REPORT

FADE IN: 
EXT. CAROLINA MALL - MORNING 
ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT FROM THE BACK. 
A PERVERT in a trench coat runs along the edge of the mall. A group of OLD WOMEN is coming toward the MAIN ENTRANCE. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes the old women. They SCREAM! 
The Pervert ducks behind the bushes and runs with the skill of a Navy SEAL. A FAMILY is walking down the sidewalk. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes them. 
The Pervert ducks behind a dumpster. He keeps running and sees a car driving by. The Pervert flashes the CAR. 
The Pervert takes a two-step run, sees ANOTHER LADY, flashes her. He dives behind a car. Then pops up and flashes ANOTHER GIRL. 
It's an all-out Pervert assault! 
The Pervert then runs across the parking lot, jumps a fence, and darts from the property -- vanishing as quickly as a Ninja who just perfectly executed an assassination. 
INT. MALL - BUSINESS OFFICES - DAY 
MARK, the Mall Manager, walks by a group of women, who were exposed to the Pervert. They crowd around and complain loudly. 
MARK Ladies, please, we're doing everything we can to handle the situation. Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our shoppers. Now in the meantime, feel free to check out some of our wonderful back-to- school sales. Excuse me for a minute. 
Mark walks down the hallway that houses all of the business affair offices. He stops at the RECEPTIONIST'S desk. 
MARK Have you seen Ronnie? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RECEPTIONIST I haven't seen him all morning. 
The Mall Manager quickly walks off.    On the way, he passes a JANITOR. 
MARK Ramon, have you seen Ronnie? 
JANITOR No, senor. 
The Mall Manager keeps walking. 
INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY 
The Mall Manager comes into the surveillance room. It's a small office with monitors that show the different security cameras around the mall. DENNIS, a Mall Security guard with sunglasses who will not utter a word ever, turns around in the chair. 
MARK Where is Ronnie? 
Dennis shrugs. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GARAGE - DAY 
Blackness. White shafts of light sporadically shoot through the dark and we see IMAGES. A GIANT FLASHLIGHT is inserted into a UTILITY BELT. MACE is inserted in the other side. A WALKIE-TALKIE is turned on. A TASER is sparked. MIRRORED SUNGLASSES are pushed over the nose. 
A garage door raises and bright light spills in... 
EXT. GARAGE - DAY 
A garage door opens slowly and reveals a souped-up ORANGE GOLF CART. There's a siren on top that spins around. The man driving is RONNIE BARNHARDT (28), a stocky mall security guard whose expression reads all business. Ronnie pulls out of the garage... 
SUPERIMPOSE:    OBSERVE AND REPORT 
EXT. MALL - DAY 
HEAVY METAL MUSIC. A group of anarchist SKATERS rages through the mall parking lot tearing up everything they see. A couple of them smoke cigarettes. One skater grinds over a bench. One kid ollies onto the hood of a car. Another slams into an old man and knocks him over. 
Meanwhile, Ronnie sits in his golf cart -- waiting. He looks eerily like Mel Gibson at the beginning of Mad Max. 
The skaters ride past a set of construction cones. One skater picks up the cone and tosses it across the parking lot. 
The skaters soar past Ronnie, who flips on the silent orange siren and gives chase. 
As the skaters ride through the parking lot, Ronnie pulls up and drives alongside of them. 
RONNIE (cop authority voice) Pull over to the sidewalk, NOW! 
STEVIE, the leader of the skaters, yells back. 
STEVIE Fuck off, Ronnie, it's just a parking lot. 
RONNIE Sir, pull over to the sidewalk, NOW! 
HECTOR, another skater, joins in. 
RONNIE (going into cop VOICE) Step away now! 
SADDAMN I pay good money to this mall. Don't tell me where to park! 
RONNIE Sir, I will be forced to take action if you do not step back! 
SADDAMN I'm gonna kill you! 
Ronnie pulls out his taser and shoots Saddamn. Saddamn goes down hard and begins twitching. He is fucking out of it! 
Ronnie goes back to giving the interview as if nothing happened. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE As I was saying, the pervert situation here is real bleak. For all you people out there thinking of coming to the mall, please for your own safety, stay away. 
SADDAMN (still fucked up) I can't believe you tased me. 
RONNIE (to the man) That's right and I've got another one waiting right here for you. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY 
BRANDI, the make-up counter girl, globs on tons of make- up. She's a hot girl who looks like she's spent a few sticky nights in the bed of a truck. 
Ronnie stands back and watches Brandi.       Finally, he walks up to her. 
RONNIE Hey, Brandi. 
Brandi looks up from her mirror and then goes back to applying make-up. 
RONNIE That color looks great on your skin. Not just that color, but I've noticed that all make-up looks really good on you. Especially the blue around your eyes. I bet it drives the men crazy. 
Brandi glares at Ronnie. 
RONNIE It's okay.   I can say that because I'm taken. 
BRANDI What do you want, Ronnie? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE I'm here on official business. See, I don't know if you know this, but I have recently been made Head of Mall Security. Did you hear about that? 
BRANDI No. 
RONNIE Well, I'm sure you will. It's actually pretty huge news. But the reason I stopped by is to tell you that it looks like we've got a pervert on the loose. A real live psychopath who gains sexual gratification by exposing himself to ladies such as yourself. I just want to warn you to be careful when coming and going to work. 
BRANDI Okay, got it. 
RONNIE And you may not want to wear any of those skirts that you like to wear. 
BRANDI What skirts? 
RONNIE You know what skirts. Something like that could set him off. And for that matter, you better not wear any of those little low-cut top things either, okay? Especially with those black bras because, you can really see them in the light. Perverts really tend to notice stuff like that. Okay, see you later. 
Ronnie takes off and leaves Brandi still applying make- up. 
INT. MALL - NIGHT 
The lights are turned off and the mall is empty.      Ronnie walks out with Dennis. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE Dennis, man, I'm glad we've got a minute to talk. There's no easy way to say this so I'm just going to come right out with it. Mark offered me the position of Head of Mall Security. I know this isn't easy for you to hear seeing as you've been here longer than me. But I want you to know that you're my best friend and I'm only going to accept the job if you're okay with that. 
Dennis shrugs. 
RONNIE Well, you should know I've already accepted and it's too late to turn it down now. Every ship needs a captain. So you were passed over. Who gives a shit? Dennis, in time, you'll come to accept answering to me. Remember, there aren't any leaders in friendship. We cool? 
Dennis and Ronnie shake hands.    They walk out and lock the doors behind them. 
RONNIE Hey, you want to go and grab a beer or something? 
Dennis doesn't say anything and just walks to his car. Ronnie follows. 
RONNIE Yeah, you're right. You're probably in no mood to party after that news. Well, try not to take it too hard. See you later, buddy. 
Ronnie leaves Dennis and walks to his car. 
EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
Ronnie's home is a shitty double-wide at the very end of the shittiest trailer park in town. 
INT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE (CONT'D) My official orders are Observe and Report, but when Mark put me in charge of mall security, something inside of me changed. It's what I've always wanted. Things haven't always worked out, with the whole... well, you know. But this gives me faith that I can do something great. This is my call to duty and I'm going to answer. I'm going to bust this fucking pervert. I swear it on everything I am. Anyway, I better get to sleep. I got a big day tomorrow. Good night, Mom. (off no answer) Mom? 
On cue, Ronnie's Mom falls over in a drunken sleep. She starts SNORING loud as hell. Ronnie gets out of the covers and helps his Mom onto the bed. Ronnie tucks her in like a loving son. He pries the bottle from her fingers. Then, he grabs a pillow and goes to sleep on the floor. 
INT. MALL - O'CHARLEY'S - DAY 
Ronnie walks up to O'Charley's. It's the one-step-up restaurant that's in the mall. There's a BOUNCER out front who watches over the store. 
RONNIE You working the door here? 
BOUNCER That's what they tell me. They needed to hire a little security here in case the drunks get out of line or whatever. 
RONNIE Kind of funny they thought they needed more security here. Ha. You do realize that if anyone gets out of hand, you need to call me to handle the situation. 
BOUNCER I work for O'Charley's, not for the mall. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE Granted, but you realize that my jurisdiction supersedes any and all other forms of security when under the roof of Carolina Mall? 
BOUNCER You know, I thought about getting a job as a Mall Security. 
RONNIE You did? 
BOUNCER Yeah, man. I mean, I'm kind of on extended vacation from college and it's just like, I don't want to do shit, you know what I mean? My parents said I have to work if I want to live at home, but I just don't feel like doing anything. This was the easiest job I could find, I mean, what the hell could be hard about being a bouncer in a mall restaurant? But now that I think about it, Mall Security could be easier than this. 
RONNIE My young friend, you are sorely mistaken. Do you know how much stuff I'm in charge of? 
BOUNCER No. 
RONNIE A shitload. That's not even counting the parking lot. 
BOUNCER Really? I thought you just kind of chilled out and called stuff into the police. 
RONNIE No way, that's about like 75, maybe 82 percent of it. There's so much other stuff. 
BOUNCER Like what? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE Two words, Friday Night. 
BOUNCER What about it? 
RONNIE It's crazy, let's just leave it at that. 
BOUNCER Okay. 
RONNIE Listen. I like you, but I don't like the fact that you're masquerading as an official in the security world. If you're serious about a career in the security world, then perhaps I could look into getting you a job on my staff? 
BOUNCER Oh yeah? 
RONNIE Part of my job is reaching out to troubled youths such as yourself. It's who I am. 
BOUNCER Does it pay more than $6.50 an hour? 
Ronnie laughs.       He leans over to the Bouncer and whispers in his ear. 
BOUNCER (WHISPERING) Seven even. 
Ronnie stands back and winks at the Bouncer. 
BOUNCER I'd say that's more than I'm making now. 
RONNIE Hold on, this job involves a probationary period. You have to prove yourself worthy. We can't just hire any old Tom, Dick, or Harry just because they want to carry a flashlight. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOUNCER What do I have to do? 
RONNIE You have to complete a term as deputy. You will answer directly to me. Your job will be to come and find me if you see any trouble. If this works out, then I will phone the crime into the police. Now, this will train your eyes to spot various criminal activity. Once you have completed your training, you will be awarded an official position on my security staff where you will have the duty of actually phoning in crimes to the police yourself. 
BOUNCER So basically, I just do what I'm doing now and then you'll get me a job? 
RONNIE For starters. 
BOUNCER How long does this mentorship last? 
RONNIE Until Mark lets me hire another guy. 
BOUNCER Can I smoke while I work? 
RONNIE Yes, you can. 
RONNIE Rogers. 
BRANDI I can't walk right now.   I feel like I'm in shock. 
RONNIE Don't worry.   I'll carry you. 
Ronnie reaches down and picks up Brandi. She totally lets him. Ronnie struggles and can't lift her. It looks dumb. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARK Oh, fucking Jesus. 
Ronnie finally manages to lift Brandi. He carries her out of the Department Store and down through the middle of the mall. 
EXT. MALL - DAY 
A black UNMARKED POLICE CAR pulls up quickly and stops directly in front of the Main Entrance to the mall as if to say to the world, "I'm a Cop and I can do this." 
Out steps DETECTIVE HARRISON, a young cop that has the arrogance and swagger of a man who is just beginning to feel his power. 
INT. MALL MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY 
Mark sits at his desk, while Ronnie comforts a crying Brandi. Dennis stands in the corner, not saying a word. 
Detective Harrison knocks as he comes in the door. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON Your secretary told me to come on in. I'm Detective Harrison, Cabarrus County Police. 
Detective Harrison shows his badge to Mark.         The two men shake. 
MARK Mark Talbert, I manage the mall. This is Brandi, she's the one who saw the deviant. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON Hello, Brandi.     Are you doing okay? 
BRANDI I'm really shaken up. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON Yes, ma'am, I'm sure you are after all you've been through, but I'm here to tell you that we're going to work together to make sure we catch the person who did this. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE My name is Ronnie Barnhardt, chief inspector on the case and head of Mall Security here at Carolina Mall and this is my lieutenant, Dennis. From one law enforcement officer to another, I just want to welcome you and say that we will do whatever it takes to coordinate with your department in order to bring this assailant to justice. 
The Detective pauses as if he's unsure what just happened. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON Great. (back to Brandi) Okay, Brandi. Did you get a look at the suspect? 
BRANDI Yes, I did. 
RONNIE Did you get a blood sample? 
BRANDI No. 
RONNIE That's a shame. Would have been useful. 
MARK Go ahead, Detective. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON Thank you. Brandi, can you remember anything specifically? What color was his hair? Was he tall or short? 
BRANDI He was tall and skinny and he had brown hair and it was real greasy. 
Detective Harrison begins writing in his note pad as Brandi speaks. Ronnie notices this and picks up some paper and begins to write as well. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON Was his hair long or short? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BRANDI It was long about to his shoulders. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON Did he say anything? 
BRANDI No, he just stood there and you know, touched himself. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON What was he wearing? 
BRANDI Just a brown trench coat. 
RONNIE This is what I got so far. 
Ronnie holds up his paper. Ronnie has drawn a crude sketch of the Pervert that Brandi described, but it's basically a long-haired stick figure with a penis. 
RONNIE What's yours look like? 
DETECTIVE HARRISON I just wrote a description. 
RONNIE Oh. 
RONNIE Hello, Saddamn. 
SADDAMN What the fuck you want, Ronnie? 
RONNIE I want your ass to face the music is what I want. 
SADDAMN Don't come any further, bitch. The restraining order says 20 feet so just back the fuck up. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON Ronnie, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but just let me handle this. (to Saddamn) Have a good day, sir. 
RONNIE So you're just gonna let him slip right through your fingers? 
DETECTIVE HARRISON I have no reason to make him a suspect. 
RONNIE No reason? Look at him. There's every reason in the goddamn book. 
SADDAMN Why are you saying that, man? 
RONNIE I think it's obvious, Saddamn. 
SADDAMN That's fucked up. You're racist, man. 
RONNIE You're not even black. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DETECTIVE HARRISON Ronnie, stop. We're finished here. Now if you're going to tag along, I'm gonna need you to just stay back; are we clear? 
RONNIE Sure, sorry.   We're crystal. 
Detective Harrison walks away. Ronnie follows, but takes one more look at Saddamn, who flips Ronnie off. 
Saddamn goes back to hollering at girls. 
SADDAMN What's up, girl, you got a boyfriend? Free cell phones with a month trial and I throw in my phone number for free. 
INT. MALL - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY 
Ronnie stands nearby as Detective Harrison questions an old Mexican JANITOR, who stands by his cart of cleaning products. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON Did you let anybody borrow your keys? 
JANITOR No, senor. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON Have you seen anything suspicious? 
JANITOR No, senor. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON Okay, sir.   Thank you for your time. 
RONNIE Alright, I believe I can be of some assistance here. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON Ronnie, we talked about this. 
RONNIE This is a special circumstance. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DETECTIVE HARRISON What special circumstance? 
RONNIE Communication skills, watch and learn. 
Ronnie steps into the forefront. 
RONNIE Que pasa? 
JANITOR Long drawn out conversation in Spanish? 
RONNIE Como? 
JANITOR More Spanish dialogue. 
RONNIE Si. (to Harrison) Yeah, this guy definitely did it. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON What did he say? 
RONNIE I don't know, I don't speak Spanish, but judging from his tonal inflections, it's safe to say that he's hiding something. The only question is where. (to Janitor) Okay, Ramon, I'm giving you one chance and one chance only to come clean. Or else Detective Harrison is going to come over to your house and deport your whole family back to Mexico. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON No, I'm not. 
RONNIE Good cop, bad cop, just play along. (to Ramon) Where are you hiding the jewels? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JANITOR No se. 
RONNIE I lied.   It is a date. 
Before she can argue, Ronnie guns the golf cart and drives away. 
EXT. MALL - MORNING 
Ronnie sees Stevie and the Skaters doing hand rails down a ramp while mall patrons try to get by without getting nailed by flying skateboards. Ronnie drives up on his golf cart. 
STEVIE Our suspension is over. 
RONNIE I'm not here for that.    I need to talk to you. 
A giant BODYGUARD with a shaved head stands up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BODYGUARD Anything you want to say to Stevie, you can say to me, motherfucker! 
RONNIE Who the fuck are you? 
STEVIE This is my cousin, Roy.      He's a boxer. 
BODYGUARD You got a fuckin' problem, bitch?! 
Ronnie reaches into his belt and produces a can of mace. He sprays it into the eyes of the Bodyguard. The guy goes down and starts SCREAMING IN PAIN. 
BODYGUARD My eyes! 
STEVIE Jesus, Ronnie, what the fuck are you doing? 
RONNIE I need a favor. 
STEVIE I'm listening. 
RONNIE As you know, we've had a lot of crime around here lately. Between the Flasher and all the break-ins, I've decided to go to the streets. Frankly, I'm looking for a stool pigeon and you're just the right person. 
STEVIE Why would I want to help you? 
RONNIE I could make it worth your while. You like skating at the mall. I could allow you to skate here whenever you wanted. In exchange, you keep your eyes peeled and provide me with any information you come across as to the identity of the perpetrators. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
STEVIE Sorry, dude, but I'm no snitch. Go find somebody else to do your dirty work. 
RONNIE Well, let me put it another way. If you don't help me, I'm gonna spread your little butt cheeks and stick this flashlight up your ass. But like for real. Like I really will do that. This is the new me talking and I get what I need, you understand me, Stevie? 
STEVIE Alright, dude, I understand, you sick fuck. 
RONNIE Cool. In that case, have fun shreadin'. 
Ronnie gets into his Golf Cart and drives off. Stevie looks down at the Boxer who is still on the ground. 
STEVIE Stop crying, Roy. 
Stevie starts skating. 
INT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY 
Ronnie walks into the Food Court and sees Nell waiting at their table with Ronnie's morning Cinnabon. He takes a deep breath and heads over. 
NELL Hey, sweetie -- Oh, I'm sorry, good morning, Officer Barnhardt. 
RONNIE Good morning, Nell. 
NELL Where were you last night? I tried to call, but your mom said you weren't home from work yet. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE Look, I got to talk to you about something. I'm not really sure how to put this. Let's see. If you drove a Toyota. 
NELL I drive a Ford. 
RONNIE I know, but let's just pretend you drove a Toyota. Now, this Toyota runs really good. It always starts when you need it to and it gets good gas mileage and you don't have to do much to maintain it. Then you get a really important job like Astronaut, no that won't work, you get a job as the head of Wall Street. Well, you may really like that Toyota, but you're going to feel weird about driving it to work every day, right? Now let's say that somebody offers you a chance to get rid of that Toyota and instead you get a Ferrari. It may be more expensive and harder to drive, but I mean, it just looks good as hell. What would you do? 
NELL I don't get it. 
RONNIE You would trade up, Nell. Well, that's exactly what I'm doing. 
NELL Are you thinking about getting a new car? 
RONNIE No, Nell, I'm getting a new girlfriend. 
NELL What?!   Who? 
RONNIE This girl, Brandi. 
MOM Really, I thought you and Nell were going to get married some day. 
RONNIE I did too. But then I met this girl Brandi and she swept me off my feet. 
MOM Well, I always liked Nell, but as long as you're happy, Ronnie, that's all I care about. 
RONNIE I actually feel kind of bad about Nell, but I figure that I can pour all the sadness into Brandi and just really rely on her for my happiness instead of Nell. 
MOM That sounds wonderful.   Is she pretty? 
RONNIE She is, Mom. She's the most perfect girl in the whole world. 
MOM I remember when your father picked me up for our first date. I swear he was the most handsome man that I had ever laid eyes on. I knew right then and there that this would be the man that I married. 
RONNIE I hope that happens tonight. 
MOM It will, Ronnie. Then you'll have to give her a ring like the one your father gave me. 
Ronnie's Mom holds up her finger for Ronnie.       It's a giant yellow/cottony-looking diamond ring. 
RONNIE Is that a yellow diamond? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MOM It's a glass diamond.   This is how it looks now. 
RONNIE Mom, why did Dad leave? 
MOM Well, he kind of freaked out when you were born. You had so many special needs that he just couldn't handle the pressure. One day, he just couldn't take it anymore. 
RONNIE Do you think it was my fault that Dad left? 
MOM Definitely. You don't think it was mine do you? 
RONNIE Well, I didn't know, with the drinking and all. 
MOM Nope, it was all you. 
Ronnie nods. 
MOM I love you, Ronnie. 
RONNIE I love you, too, Mom. 
INT. CAPTAIN O'LANDERS - NIGHT 
The restaurant is the cheesiest of all sea food restaurants. Think one step down from Red Lobster. Ronnie sits across the table from Brandi. She chugs one of those giant frozen drinks, killing it in one gulp. 
RONNIE Damn, that was pretty impressive. 
BRANDI Yeah, work's been pissing me off, so I just need to blow off some steam. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE Well, Brandi, can I just say that you look absolutely beautiful tonight. 
BRANDI Yeah, I know. (calling to waiter) Nurse! Get me another -- (to Ronnie) You got this, right? 
RONNIE Yeah, yeah.   No problem. 
BRANDI Nurse! Bring me another and keep 'em coming. (to Ronnie) I think it's funny to call the waitress nurse. 
Ronnie takes a pill bottle out of his pocket.       He opens it up and pops a pill. 
BRANDI Hey, what's that? 
RONNIE Oh, it's nothing. 
BRANDI Don't be stingy, what the fuck is that? 
RONNIE It's just a pill I'm supposed to take. 
BRANDI Let me see. 
Ronnie hands the pills to Brandi. 
BRANDI Where the fuck did you find these? 
RONNIE The Doctor. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BRANDI Damn, Ronnie, Klonopin. I'm impressed. This is the good shit. I didn't know you partied like this. 
RONNIE Yeah, I guess I party like this every four to six hours as needed. 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE Brandi, I had a wonderful time tonight. 
BRANDI I'm so fucking shit-faced. 
They kiss again, but when they do, Brandi pukes all over the place. It's a disgusting puke and there's vomit on her cheek and stuff. Ronnie holds her head for her. 
RONNIE Are you okay? 
BRANDI My breath smells like asshole. 
Ronnie looks longingly into her eyes. 
RONNIE I love you, Brandi. 
BRANDI I think I've got puke in my teeth. 
RONNIE I don't care. 
Ronnie kisses Brandi passionately on the mouth. He walks her inside the house. On the way in, she falls over. Ronnie helps her up. He carries her into the house where the make-love spot is. 
CUT TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
INT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY 
Ronnie is with Dennis in the food court. Ronnie is smiling, but Dennis isn't saying a word as usual. 
RONNIE Don't look at me like that, Dennis. I told you I wouldn't talk. 
Ronnie sits back, but he can't help a giant grin on his face. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE I'm serious, Dennis. A gentleman never kisses and tells. So, just stop with all the pressure because it's just not gonna happen. 
Ronnie keeps on grinning at Dennis. 
RONNIE Okay, fine, you son of a bitch, you want details, I'll give you details. I had sex with Brandi last night. 
Dennis and Ronnie high-five. 
RONNIE It was amazing. I mean, I've never experienced anything like it. I've been with a girl or two. 
Dennis stares at Ronnie. 
RONNIE Okay, fine, I've been with a girl, but let me tell you, this was so much better. You know how many times we did it? Twice! BAM! BAM! BAM! 
OVER AT THE CINNABON STAND 
Nell, who looks like she's been crying nonstop, stuffs a whole Cinnabon into her face. As it fills her cheeks, she looks over to Ronnie's table and sees Ronnie making thrusting motions at the table. Nell swallows, stuffs another Cinnabon in, then storms out of the Food Court. 
BACK AT RONNIE'S TABLE 
Ronnie continues to talk to Dennis. 
RONNIE But I got to tell you, Dennis. It was steamy and sexy, but more than anything, I should tell you that it's her soul that I fell for the most. She got pretty tanked, but I could just really tell that she's a good person. The kind of person that I could see myself with. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE (CONT'D) Look, I'm gonna get out of here. There's a lot of people I need to tell about this, so I'll catch up with you later. Oh, and I almost forgot, keep your eyes peeled for crime and stuff. 
Ronnie leaves the table. 
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY 
Nell watches Brandi as she pops a couple of aspirin behind the makeup counter. She takes a deep breath and walks up to the counter. 
NELL Excuse me. 
BRANDI How may I help you? 
NELL I need to talk to you. 
BRANDI What is it, honey? Let me guess. You're looking for something to take care of those blackheads and hide that puffiness under your eyes. I've got just the thing. 
NELL No, that's not it.    Well, how much is it? 
BRANDI Fifty dollars for the bottle. 
NELL Okay, I'll take it. 
Brandi begins to ring up the cream. 
NELL Listen, I know you're Ronnie's new girlfriend. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE Seems   like a big bag of roses would   be more love than just one, but I   guess you're the expert. Gimme   one. 
The Flower Salesman takes a single red rose from the case and hands it to Ronnie. 
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY 
Brandi is behind the counter gossiping with Bruce. Ronnie holds his rose and watches them from a distance. He takes a deep breath and then walks to the counter. 
RONNIE Brandi? 
BRANDI What are you doing here? 
RONNIE I came here to see you. And to present you with this single red rose. It symbolizes 'love.' 
BRANDI Ronnie, that's really... uncalled for. 
RONNIE Well, after last night,   I just wanted you to know that   it wasn't just some fling to me.    It meant something special and I   felt it deep in my soul. 
BRUCE You fucked the Security Guard? (PLAYFUL) You are such a little slut! 
BRANDI Oh, like you've never been drunk, Bruce! 
Brandi grabs Ronnie and pulls him off to the side. 
BRANDI Ronnie, look. I got to be honest with you. I barely remember last night. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE I remember it for the both of us. 
BRANDI Okay, see here's the thing. I don't know how to say this, so I'm just gonna come on out with it. Ronnie, I could never date you seriously. I mean, you're a security guard. 
RONNIE I'm the head of Mall Security. 
BRANDI Exactly. The point is, I don't really see myself being with that. Like ever. You know what I mean? 
RONNIE Brandi, I know exactly what you mean. And I just want to thank you for being honest. You're telling me I'm not living up to my full potential in life. It's funny, because I've been feeling like this for quite some time. I guess I just needed that extra little push to get me over this hurdle I've been stuck on. How can you be with a man who isn't living the life he was meant to? 
BRANDI Yeah, something like that. And just you know, you're a security guard at the mall and it's like, come on, you know? 
RONNIE I don't like it, Brandi, but I do understand. I promise you this. Next time you see me, I will be wearing a uniform that will make you proud. I will be the man that you will be honored to call your life's love. 
BRANDI Don't bet on it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE I will though. I'll bet everything I have on you. Now I ask you for one favor. Although I am unworthy, will you accept this rose from me anyway? 
BRANDI I can't do that. And tell your girlfriend to stop coming by my work and threatening me and shit. 
Brandi walks away, leaving Ronnie there holding his flower. 
CUT TO: 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
Ronnie sits at a small table and waits patiently. Then a POLICEMAN walks into the room. Ronnie stands to shake his hand. 
RONNIE I'm here to become a police officer. 
POLICEMAN We're always on the hunt for new recruits. Do you have at least a high school diploma? 
RONNIE I have a GED. 
POLICEMAN We usually prefer an actual diploma, but GED is technically acceptable. Are you a citizen of the United States? 
RONNIE You bet your ass I am. 
POLICEMAN Okay, Mr. Barnhardt, there are several steps you have to complete in order to be eligible for the police academy. Physical evaluation, psychological test, background check. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
POLICEMAN (CONT'D) If you pass these tests, you will be admitted to the police academy. Now, I like to tell all new recruits that they should complete a ride along before making this decision. It's where you actually ride along with a real police officer during a routine patrol. It helps give you an idea of the kind of situations you'll be dealing with. Sound good? 
RONNIE That sounds fun. Sign me up. 
INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT 
Ronnie sits in the unmarked police car with Detective Harrison. 
RONNIE It's like it was meant to be. You behind the wheel. Me riding shotgun. Two brothers of the badge unite to form the ultimate crime-stopping combo. I'm psyched to be here, Harrison. Thank you for the opportunity. 
Detective Harrison keeps on driving without looking back. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CROSSROADS - A SHORT TIME LATER 
Ronnie looks petrified as he stands guard.       A BUM stands off to the side staring Ronnie down. 
Ronnie waves to the bum. The bum runs his finger under his throat. Ronnie tries to ignore him. 
A group of KIDS walk by Ronnie talking loudly. 
RONNIE Hey, no horse play. You guys get on home. 
KID You want some crack? 
RONNIE No, I don't want any crack. In fact, I didn't want to do this, but you leave me no choice in the matter. I'm placing you under citizen's arrest. 
Ronnie grabs the little Kid by the shoulders to restrain him. 
KID Let me go, motherfucker! 
RONNIE I place you under citizen's arrest for the crime of selling a Schedule 1 Narcotic. You have the right to remain silent... 
Unbeknownst to Ronnie, Gang Members start walking up behind him. It's like that scene in Training Day where all the gangsters are hanging out right across the street with guns and shit. They come up behind him as he speaks to the kids... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE ... If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you. Now I guess we just wait here for my ride to come back. 
Ronnie turns around to look for Harrison's return, but instead he sees that he is surrounded by a large group of pissed-off GANG MEMBERS. 
GANG MEMBER #1 That's my little brother you got there. 
RONNIE Who, this little guy right here? 
GANG MEMBER #1 That's right. 
RONNIE Well, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but it appears that your little brother has tried to sell me illegal drugs. I know it's hard for you to hear that. 
GANG MEMBER #1 He works for me, motherfucker! 
RONNIE Is that so? Well then, it looks like you got one less employee because I'm taking little brother down. I'll die right here before I let crime prevail. 
The Gang Members all pull out their guns and point them at Ronnie. 
RONNIE (to the little Kid) Free to go, little brother. My mistake completely. Good luck with the crack. 
The little Kid runs off. 
RONNIE Alright, so I guess I'll be seeing you folks. 
The Gang Members stand in Ronnie's way and cock their guns. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GANG MEMBER #2 Yo, waste this pig, Tone. 
RONNIE Oh, no. That's really not necessary, Tone. 
GANG MEMBER #2 Do it, man. 
Gang Member #1 puts the gun right up to Ronnie's head. 
RONNIE Oh, Jesus, I don't want to die. Don't let me die, don't do it! 
Ronnie goes down on his knees. 
RONNIE No, please!   I'm sorry! 
Ronnie reaches into his boot and pulls out a small rod. He flips his wrist and it extends into a night stick. Ronnie's begging was a trap. Ronnie pops up and begins dropping all those motherfuckers with lightning-fast precision. 
Ronnie breaks arms and busts heads like a fucking ninja. Gang Member #1 comes in and hits Ronnie with a sucker punch, busting his nose wide open. 
Ronnie stands up and goes mano y mano in a fist fight with Gang Member #1. He starts kicking Ronnie's ass. Ronnie goes down again and Gang Member #1 starts stomping Ronnie. 
Ronnie grabs Gang Member #1's leg and twists it. He takes him down. Ronnie jumps on top of him and begins beating him senseless. 
SLOW MOTION: Ronnie stands up and looks around at the pool of beaten bodies. This is Ronnie at his most primal and also at his best. 
CUT TO: 
INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Detective Harrison is eating doughnuts and laughing with a bunch of other COPS. 
(CONTINUED) 
MARK Do you have any experience, son? 
CHARLES Not really. 
RONNIE Um, sir, I have personally been training young Charles for weeks now in preparation for this day. The kid kind of looks up to me. I'm some what of a big brother to the little guy. 
Charles kind of looks at Ronnie like he's crazy. 
MARK Alright, it's actually not a bad idea. It might make our Security more visible so we can give people the illusion that we're on top of this. 
Ronnie winks at Charles. 
CHARLES Thank you, Mark. 
MARK Ronnie, one more thing. Look, if this crime doesn't come to an end pretty soon, we're gonna have to let someone go. I mean, you've always done a great job for me, but the truth is, someone is going to have to take the fall. You're the one who wanted to be Head of Mall Security and quite frankly, I just bought my wife a new Cadillac, so let's just say it won't be me. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE With Charles on my team, I can now devote more time to the robbery and Pervert case. I plan on having these wrapped up by the end of the week. 
Mark laughs to himself. 
RONNIE Why'd you just laugh? 
MARK It's nothing.    Have fun, Ronnie. 
Ronnie looks at Charles. 
RONNIE Did I say something funny? 
CHARLES Let's go, Ronnie. 
Ronnie and Charles take off. 
INT. MALL - DAY 
Ronnie and Charles stand in the middle of the floor and supervise the "mall walkers." 
CHARLES Be careful, guys. Nice and slow. 
RONNIE That's not bad, but you need to learn to speak in a more authoritative voice. Watch this. Slow it down! Slow it down! You've already received one verbal, don't make me issue a second! (back to Charles) See, you can't be intimidated. You have to make them respect you. 
CHARLES Ronnie, you know I really want to thank you for the job. You're a man of your word. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE No problem, my young student. So, I got something to tell you. Keep this between us until it's official, but I don't think I'm going to be here for much longer. 
CHARLES You're quitting? But you love this job. 
RONNIE I do love it, but it looks like someone is going to be joining the police force. 
CHARLES The real police? 
RONNIE They're calling me up. It's basically a done deal. Just a little red tape is the only thing keeping me from carrying a gun. 
CHARLES I didn't even know you wanted to become a Cop. 
RONNIE It's always been my job. The Mall thing is great training, but it has its limitations. Some stars are just meant to shine brighter than others. 
CHARLES Congrats, brother. 
RONNIE (to a mall walker) HEY, SLOW IT DOWN, LADY! 
A Mall Walker slows her pace.        She turns around and Ronnie sees that it's Nell. 
RONNIE Nell? 
NELL Hey, Ronnie. 
RONNIE What are you doing? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NELL Nothing, just getting in shape. 
RONNIE Well, that's okay, I guess.   Just watch your speed, okay? 
Nell waves and walks on. 
CHARLES Isn't that your girlfriend? 
RONNIE Ex. 
CHARLES She looked good. 
RONNIE Why would you say that? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MOM You know why. I just don't want to see you get hurt. It's my job to protect you from the bullshit. 
RONNIE Mom, I appreciate it, but I'm going to make it as a police officer. I'm tired of coming in second all the time. Everybody in life gets to go for their goals, why should I be any different? 
MOM I know. Just be careful is all. You've got a good heart and I don't want to see it broken. 
RONNIE Okay, Mom.   I hear you. 
MOM And, Ronnie, one more thing. 
RONNIE What's that, Mom? 
In the tub, a bunch of bubbles plop to the surface. 
RONNIE Mom!   That's gross! 
MOM (drunk laughing) That's right! Now you got to smell it! 
RONNIE Mom. 
EXT. POLICE ACADEMY - DAY 
The Police Academy is full of energy as new recruits pour up the steps and into the building, eager to start their training. 
Ronnie comes walking up and takes a long look at the building. Ronnie smiles to himself and heads up the stairs. 
Ronnie reaches the top where Detective Harrison is waiting. Ronnie stops. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE Ronnie Barnhardt reporting for duty. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON I can see that. Listen, I don't really know how to say this, but we're not going to be able to let you join the academy. 
RONNIE What?!   Why not? 
DETECTIVE HARRISON It seems you had a little trouble passing the minimum requirements. 
RONNIE Did I fail one of the tests? 
DETECTIVE HARRISON Well, yes, actually, you failed the psychological exam. 
RONNIE No! 
DETECTIVE HARRISON It says... (reads from the form) That Ronnie Barnhardt shows warning signs of delusion and allowing him to join the force puts his life and the lives of others in jeopardy. 
RONNIE Detective Harrison, you've got to believe me. I'm completely sound. This has got to be a mistake. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON Ronnie, I personally did your background check and this is the fifth time you've been turned down for the police academy. 
RONNIE You guys keep records on that? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DETECTIVE HARRISON We sure do. Look, I tried to talk to them, but there's no way they're gonna let you in. I'm sorry, but your dreams of becoming a Police Officer just aren't going to happen. 
RONNIE I understand. Thanks for believing in me, Detective. And just for the record, I'm not crazy. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON Take care, Ronnie. 
Detective Harrison goes inside and closes the doors on Ronnie. 
Ronnie stands outside of the closed academy by himself. 
The CAMERA PUSHES INTO Ronnie and SPINS UPSIDE-DOWN. 
CUT TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
INT. CAROLINA MALL - MORNING 
Ronnie is behind the locked gate to the food court, but it looks like he is behind bars in a prison. Ronnie slides the bars up and walks out. 
INT. MALL - DAY Ronnie walks through the mall and looks at the lights of the different shops. Everything looks colorful and weird. Ronnie is in his own head. This isn't the exciting world as before, now it's a disgusting fabricated make-believe land. 
TIME LAPSE: A DAY SPEEDS BY AS RONNIE WALKS LIKE A ZOMBIE THROUGH IT ALL. 
INT. MALL - FOOD COURT - NIGHT 
The mall is kind of winding down for the day.      The stores are closing and people are going home. 
RONNIE What do you mean? 
STEVIE I don't know.    You just seem kind of sad. 
RONNIE Nah, man, I'm fine. I mean, I'm catchin' perverts and protecting this mall and just you know, really livin' the dream. 
STEVIE That's cool.    Look, man, you want to get high? 
RONNIE No, I don't want to get high. 
STEVIE That's cool. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
The conversation dies down and the two just kind of sit there. 
RONNIE And by the way, if I see you getting high, I will call the police and have your criminal ass arrested. Don't you fuckin' ever mistake my kindness for weakness. I hate drugs and I hate you too. 
STEVIE Fine, you fucking dick. 
Steve stands up to leave.    Ronnie sits there looking sad. 
EXT. MALL - NIGHT 
Ronnie sits in his golf cart staring at the mall as the last of the customers leave. That's when Ronnie sees Brandi come out of the door. Brandi looks around and darts across the parking lot. 
Ronnie follows Brandi's path and tries to catch up with her. 
EXT. MALL - NIGHT 
Ronnie drives around, but he can't find Brandi anywhere. 
Ronnie sees a lone black car at the outer edge of the parking lot. He pulls his golf cart over and climbs out. 
Ronnie creeps up to the car and peers in the window. Inside, Ronnie sees Brandi and Detective Harrison banging like a couple of wild animals. 
Ronnie jumps back in shock! 
INT. DETECTIVE HARRISON'S CAR - NIGHT 
Brandi stops humping Detective Harrison. 
BRANDI Shhhh. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON What is it? 
BRANDI I thought I heard something. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Detective Harrison looks out of the window. He doesn't see anything. He climbs back on top of Brandi. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON It's nothing. 
OUT OF NOWHERE, A FLASHLIGHT BREAKS THE BACK WINDOW OF THE CAR. 
EXT. MALL - NIGHT 
Ronnie runs around Detective Harrison's car wielding a flashlight like a mad man. 
RONNIE HARRISON!!! 
Ronnie beats the shit out of Harrison's car.        He smashes headlights, mirrors and fenders. 
INSIDE THE CAR 
Harrison and Brandi duck down. 
BRANDI Shit! 
DETECTIVE HARRISON That motherfucker is crazy. 
BRANDI Well, you're the fucking cop.   Do something. 
DETECTIVE HARRISON You're right.    Okay, here it goes. 
Harrison reaches over Brandi and opens her door. 
BRANDI What the fuck are you doing?! 
Harrison pushes Brandi out of the car and shuts himself back in. 
OUTSIDE 
Ronnie sees Brandi and stops pummeling the car. 
(CONTINUED) 
This is the REAL DENNIS and for the first time ever, he speaks... 
DENNIS (high ghetto voice) I've been waiting on you to get on my page this whole time. You look at this mall as a Kingdom?! Shit! I look at this place like a motherfucking jail sentence. You put on that uniform every morning, but what are you really protecting? Commerce and corporations and money. Well I say, fuck that! I'm a fucking outlaw and I'm going to live that until the day I die. Now, I can show you the way, but you've got to be willing to accept it. So I'm gonna ask you now, Ronnie. Are you ready for a trip to the other side? 
RONNIE You're goddamn right I'm ready. 
DENNIS Alright then.    Let's party. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DUMPSTERS - DAY 
Dennis and Ronnie hang in the back of the mall by the dumpsters. Dennis sucks down a fat joint. He passes it to Ronnie. 
DENNIS So, yeah, usually I take a joint straight to the head before I start work in this motherfucker, but on really stressful days, I like to get drunk too. 
Dennis pulls out a flask and gulps it down. Ronnie is still staring at the joint. Finally he takes a puff and begins violently coughing. He finally stops. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE Fuck it, give me the bottle. 
Dennis hands Ronnie the bottle and he takes a big swig. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MALL - DAY 
Ronnie and Dennis stand against a wall while they check out booties of various shapes and sizes on all of the girls that walk by. 
DENNIS So then I usually come in here and perv out on girls for about an hour or two. I hooked up twice last week. One was this Asian chick and the other was this mom. She wasn't that hot, but what else do I got to do? 
Two high school girls walk by. 
DENNIS Sweet Jesus in the morning. 
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DRESSING ROOM - DAY 
Ronnie and Dennis are hanging in a dressing room. 
DENNIS Dressing rooms are a great place to hide out, because nobody is really going to think of looking for me here. You can nap or just kind of hang out and just really have some personal time. Hey, hand me that camera. 
Ronnie picks up a shitty camera and hands it to Dennis. 
DENNIS Thanks, Ronnie. 
Dennis stands up on the bench and looks into the other changing room. The two high school girls are changing into other clothes. Dennis starts taking pictures of them without them knowing. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DUMPSTERS - DAY 
Ronnie is smoking a joint and so is Dennis. 
DENNIS Right before lunch I usually blaze up again real good. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MALL - DAY 
Dennis and Ronnie walk by the skaters. 
DENNIS Hey, what's up, motherfuckers?! 
STEVIE What up, Big Den?! 
DENNIS You know, smokin' that good good. 
STEVIE Dude, why are you hanging out with Ronnie? 
RONNIE Fuck you, Stevie! 
DENNIS Hey, Ronnie's alright.   Let me see that stick. 
Stevie slides the skateboard over to Dennis. He jumps on it and does a perfectly executed kick flip. The skaters cheer! 
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY 
Brandi is at the counter with Bruce.   She helps a MALE customer. 
BRANDI That'll be $39.99. 
MALE My wife's gonna love this perfume. 
BRANDI I hope so.   It's my favorite. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Dennis holds up a sweat shirt. 
DENNIS This probably will look good with my complexion. 
RONNIE Dennis, I can't take part in this. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DENNIS Ronnie, I thought you were down?! What the fuck?! Here I am opening up myself to you and you're just gonna stick it to me like this. What the fuck has this place ever done for you? Don't you know that people see us as jokes?! A useless tool that's left in the shed. Well that's not me. Not now, not ever. I told you, I'm an outlaw. 
RONNIE I can't let you rob the mall. 
DENNIS What the fuck you mean you can't let me? 
RONNIE Come on, Dennis. We're best friends, so just put that stuff back and let's go get a beer. 
DENNIS Alright, Ronnie, you're right. 
Dennis sets the shirts down. 
DENNIS I don't really know what I was thinking. Robbing the mall? Let's just go get that beer. 
RONNIE Good, man.   That makes me feel better. 
Ronnie turns to walk, but Dennis grabs the hand of one of the mannequins and rips it off. He takes the hand and cracks Ronnie over the head with it. Ronnie goes down on his knees. 
DENNIS See ya in Mexico, bitch. 
Dennis cocks back and whacks Ronnie again.      Ronnie's lights go out. 
EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT 
Dennis pulls out of the mall driving a HARLEY DAVIDSON. He flips a joint into the air and peels out. He cruises down the street. He passes a cop car and flips it off. 
CUT TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
INT. CAROLINA MALL - MORNING 
The JANITOR walks up the floor with a mop. Ronnie is battered and bloodied from his fight with Dennis, but he is wide awake and handcuffed to THE GAP. 
RONNIE Ramon, get your ass over here! Go get my spare keys out of the office. 
The Janitor looks at Ronnie, smiles, and calmly mops in the other direction. 
RONNIE Ramon! Goddamn it get back here! Go get my goddamn keys. 
INT. MALL - MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY 
Mark sits across the desk from Ronnie and Charles. 
MARK How fucking stupid do you have to be?! I mean Dennis. What the fuck, Ronnie? How could you not have known it was Dennis? Then, how the fuck could you be so stupid as to let him get away. OBSERVE AND REPORT. Those are the only two things you have to do and you can't do those worth a shit. 
RONNIE Can I speak now? 
MARK Go ahead. 
RONNIE Are you sure? 
MARK Just start talking, Ronnie! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE It seems only natural that 'some people' would want to blame me and truth be told I do put a lot of that blame on myself. But some people might say that the cops are to blame for not catching them. Some people might say that the reason this happened was the undeniable fact that I was under- equipped and quite frankly, lacking a sufficient firearm. But not me. I carry this loss alone deep inside my heart. 
MARK Good.   Because you're fired. 
RONNIE (PLAYFUL) Fuck you. 
MARK I'm serious, Ronnie. I've always liked you, but there's just no excuse for this. Somebody is going down and I'll be damned if it's going to be me. Now, don't make a big thing out of this. Just pack your shit and get out by the end of the day. 
RONNIE Wait a minute. I thought I could trust you, Mark, and now you're telling me that you're going to be the one to put the knife in my back. Fair weather friend you are. 
MARK I'm not your friend, I'm your boss. 
RONNIE You think you're so smart, Mark. You don't know everything. If you're firing me, then you can say goodbye to your entire Security staff. Because there is no fucking way my team is going to work here if you fire me. Isn't that right, Charles? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CHARLES Ronnie, I got to talk to you about this. Mark asked me down here to escort you out. 
RONNIE And you told him to fuck off, right? Charles? Right? 
CHARLES What the fuck do you want from me, Ronnie? 
EXT. JAIL - DAY 
Ronnie walks up the steps that lead to the local jail. 
INT. JAIL - DAY 
Ronnie walks into one of those booths where you can talk to a prisoner on the opposite side of a Plexiglas divider. Ronnie sits down in wait. Then, two GUARDS appear escorting a handcuffed Dennis. Dennis takes a seat and picks up the phone. 
DENNIS What's up, Ronnie? How you doing? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE I've been better. You? 
DENNIS I'm holding it down in here. 
RONNIE Yeah, I heard they finally caught up with you. 
DENNIS I know. I should have hit Mexico, but, you know, I got stoned and just kind of kicked with this girl in Kannapolis for a while. 
RONNIE You know they fired me when they found out you were the one who robbed the mall. 
DENNIS Shit, dog.    Sorry about that. 
RONNIE It's cool, but I need to know why you did it. 
DENNIS I told you.   I'm an outlaw. 
RONNIE Come on, Dennis. 
DENNIS Man, you want to know the real reason? 
RONNIE Yeah. 
DENNIS Alright, I'll tell you. Man, that gig was one of the best jobs I ever had. I got to wear a uniform, I could smoke weed whenever I wanted. For once in my life, I felt like I was actually somebody. I know most people don't think it's shit, but I really loved it. Then, all of a sudden, I find out that your ass got promoted over me. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DENNIS (CONT'D) After all I put into it, you're the one that makes it to Head of Mall Security. You know what it's like to get passed over, Ronnie? So I got pissed off. I started robbing the joint as a way to get at them for what they did to me. But you know what, Ronnie? 
RONNIE What's that? 
DENNIS You ever love a girl so much that you can't break up with her, so the only thing you can do when she pisses you off is smack her in the goddamn face? 
RONNIE No, Dennis, I haven't. 
DENNIS Well, I have. And that's pretty much how I felt about the job. 
RONNIE Thanks for talking to me, Dennis. 
DENNIS Well, it's the least I could do after knocking you out and all. 
Ronnie starts to hang up the phone. 
DENNIS Hey, Ronnie. 
RONNIE Yeah, Dennis. 
DENNIS Bail me out of here, old friend. 
RONNIE I can't do it, Dennis. You're now a criminal who stopped caring, but my crime is that I care too much. 
Ronnie hangs up the phone and walks out. 
INT. MALL - DAY 
Ronnie comes into the mall and makes his way down the center of it, feeling naked without his uniform. 
Charles, now wearing a mall security uniform, comes out and stops Ronnie. 
CHARLES Ronnie, what are you doing back here? 
RONNIE I just came to talk to Nell. Don't get your panties in a wad, I'm just here as any normal patron. 
CHARLES Ronnie, dude, I've been all fucked up in the head. I feel like shit about what happened. I mean, here I am, just looking to shuck responsibility and I ended up hurting you in the process. Look, I should have been honest with you. I don't give two shits about this stupid job. But you do. 
RONNIE It's okay, Charles. 
CHARLES I've decided I'm going back to college. Getting stoned and studying beats this any day. I realize that now. I realize that there aren't any jobs where you can avoid hard choices. Anyway, take as long as you want at the mall. I'll keep Mark off your back. 
RONNIE Thanks, Charles. 
INT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY 
Ronnie sees Nell sitting down and eating a Cinnabon. Ronnie takes a seat at her table. 
NELL Ronnie, what are you doing here? 
Ronnie lays on the ground and sees Ramon laughing against a wall with a mop in his hands. 
RONNIE Okay, Ramon, we're fucking even! 
Ronnie picks himself up and starts running again. 
CUT TO: 
THE PERVERT 
runs past VICTORIA'S SECRET. He stops at the doorway and as if he can't resist, flashes the ladies in the store. He takes off running again. 
CUT TO: 
RONNIE 
as he runs by the RECORD STORE, which of course is BLASTING MUSIC. Ronnie stops at the doorway. 
RONNIE Turn it down.     Turn it down. 
The Record Store guy turns the MUSIC DOWN.   Ronnie goes back to his chase. 
CUT TO: 
THE PERVERT 
runs past Mark.    He looks around at all the people staring. 
MARK Okay, show's over. Enjoy your shopping experience at Carolina Mall. 
Ronnie runs past Mark. 
MARK Jesus. (calling out) Charles! 
Charles comes running up. 
CHARLES What is it? 
MARK Call the police. And go get Ronnie. 
CHARLES He's trying to help. 
MARK Just do what I ask you. 
Charles runs after them. Ronnie sees Charles coming and runs faster. Charles is moving in on him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CHARLES Hey, Ronnie! 
Ronnie turns around to see Charles as he flings him a giant flashlight. Ronnie catches it. 
RONNIE Fuck yeah! 
Ronnie starts running again, but this time, he's a little more together. 
CUT TO: 
THE PERVERT 
has made his way through the whole mall at this point, but Ronnie is right on his ass. The Pervert is heading toward the DEPARTMENT STORE. 
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY 
The Pervert comes barreling in and the ladies at the perfume and make-up counters SCREAM. 
He looks like he's charging straight at Brandi.    He's getting closer. 
BOOM! Ronnie comes in from the side and nails the Pervert with the flashlight. Ronnie jumps on top of the Perv and beats the ever-living shit out of him. This is a vision of a man leaving all out on the field. 
Ronnie stops pounding and looks up. He sees Brandi staring at him. Ronnie is overcome by anger and beats on the Pervert harder than ever before. Finally, Charles comes in and pulls Ronnie off of him. 
A huge crowd has gathered around. Ronnie has blood all over him. Ronnie picks the Pervert up and holds him tightly by the arms. Mark comes running up. 
CHARLES You want to report this to the police. 
RONNIE Hell no.   I'm taking him down myself. 
Ronnie starts to walk away with the Pervert. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARK Hey, Ronnie. 
Ronnie stops and turns around.       Mark tosses Ronnie a set of keys. 
MARK Good job, Ronnie.

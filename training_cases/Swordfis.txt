KAPLAN Senator, we just received a communication that Axl Torvalds was intercepted entering the continental U.S.

SENATOR REISMAN When? 
KAPLAN Within the last two hours. According to our source inside the F.B.I., he was nabbed coming through customs at L.A.X. Alone... 
SENATOR REISMAN Do they know who they are dealing with? 
KAPLAN It is unlikely, sir. It was a routine check and Torvalds freaked out. They just got lucky. 
SENATOR REISMAN This ain't good, boys. The Vortex has used Torvalds before. What do the feds know? 
KAPLAN Nothing as of yet. He's refusing to speak English and the Finnish consulate has already contacted the State Department... 
SENATOR REISMAN So we haven't been compromised? 
KAPLAN We're not sure. We're working on that right now. 
SENATOR REISMAN You better get sure real quick, son, 'cause someone's cock's liable to end up on the block on this one. And I promise you it won't be mine. 
KAPLAN Senator, I think we'll be okay here -- 
SENATOR REISMAN I don't fucking pay you to think, Kaplan. I pay you to keep me informed. I know the Vortex. That's why I voted against using him on American soil. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
25   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               25 
SENATOR REISMAN (CONT'D) It's like using the Ebola virus to cure a cancer patient. Son, what do you think's going to happen if he starts tying up loose ends. 
They look at each other. 
KAPLAN Yessir.   I understand.

26   EXT. MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - DAY                                    26 
We are indeed in the middle of nowhere, no nothing as far as you can see. We CONTINUE TO CRANE UP, a $140,000 Ferrari Modena flies down the road in a cloud of suspended gravel toward Stanley's dilapidated, piece-o'- crap trailer. 
27   EXT. TRAILER - ROOF - DAY                                       27 
Stan stands on the roof of his trailer, which was a dilapidated shack in the 1950s and now is a lot worse.     A chained but scruffy-looking Rottweiler runs around in front of the trailer. 
Stan looks completely different than he did in the opening sequence. He hasn't taken very good care of himself. His hair is long, and right now standing on end. He is wearing nothing but a dirty towel, and is slicing golf balls off the roof. Whack. 
As the Ferrari drives up he begins hitting golf balls at it, but he just isn't very good. Nevertheless, after a dozen bad hits, a lucky shot ricochets off the aluminum hood. 
CLOSEUP - FERRARI HOOD 
CLANG! 
BACK TO SCENE 
Stan smiles as the car slides to a halt in the gravel driveway, and turns back to his "work."

ANGLE ON STANLEY 
As we hear the DOOR SHUT and SOMEONE COMES UP the aluminum extension ladder. 
A few moments later, in SLOW MOTION, GINGER appears at the top of the ladder and steps onto the trailer's roof. Stan turns around. 
She is what the hack writers of the Thirties would call a vision. Thesauruses could be exhausted searching for adjectives that do her justice. 
In the low-rent light of Stanley's white trash haven, she is, by definition, a goddess. 
STANLEY Who are you supposed to be? 
WHACK (slice). 
She lights a cigarette, inhales deeply, then exhales. 
GINGER Hello, Stanley. 
She knows his name. 
GINGER I'm Ginger. 
STANLEY Is that right? 
WHACK (slice). 
GINGER For someone the N.S.A. has listed as the most dangerous hacker in America, you sure don't look like much. 
30   EXT. STANLEY'S TRAILER - DAY                                   30 
Stanley practically pitches her down the steps of his trailer and slams the door. 
GINGER Shit... 
31   INT. MALIBU HOUSE - DAY                                        31 
A TELEPHONE RINGS in a multi-zillion dollar Malibu beach house. A WOMAN, late twenties, grabs the receiver. Her voice is of perfect timbre and accentless. 
MELISSA (WOMAN) Hello.

STANLEY (V.O.) Melissa... (beat) Holly home? 
MELISSA (New York starts to invade her accentless accent) Stanley. Why are you calling here?

on phone. He stands in front of his now closed fridge. It is covered with pictures of his daughter, Holly. 
STANLEY I want to talk with Holly. 
INTERCUT BETWEEN the two. 
Melissa's accent continues to travel eastward from Midwest flat to full tilt Long Island. 
MELISSA It's... (looks at her watch) It's twelve-thirty, Stanley. She's in school. You know it's illegal for you to talk to her. 
STANLEY Don't do this, Mel. It's not good for Holly -- 
MELISSA How the hell would you know what is or isn't good for my daughter? You've spent the last two years in prison. 
STANLEY Mel -- 
MELISSA Stop calling me that, Stanley. 
STANLEY I just want to see my baby. 
(CONTINUED) 
32   CONTINUED:                                                       32 
MELISSA Well, she doesn't want to see you, Stanley, and I swear to fucking God, if you contact her, I'll have Larry's attorney throw you into a hole so deep and dark it'll make Leavenworth seem like two weeks in Vegas; during which I'll personally pay two ball-busting skin-heads to -- 
STANLEY Wow, Mel, you can take the girl out of the trailer park, but you can't take the trailer park out of the girl. 
She regains control.       Her voice is accentless once again. 
MELISSA (exhaling) I will not let myself be manipulated by you, Stanley. Larry's her father now. 
STANLEY Larry's the porn king -- 
MELISSA Larry's a film financier, a good husband, and an astute businessman. What films he's involved in are a function of profitability and none of your business. 
She is now downright icy. 
MELISSA Get help, Stanley, get into a program, get a therapist, get a dog, but whatever you do, stay away from my child. 
STANLEY Your child?    She's our child. 
MELISSA She will never be your child. You'll never have the kind of money to match Larry's lawyers in court. Forget Holly.

CLICK. 
The PHONE GOES DEAD. 
Stanley freaks, beats the receiver against the fridge, again, and again. Then, he calmly hangs up the phone. 
33   EXT. STANLEY'S TRAILER - DAY                                   33 
Stanley walks down the steps of his trailer. Ginger sits on the hood of her car in all her estrogenic glory, smoking and petting Stan's dog. 
STANLEY What are you doing here? 
Stanley's dog leans against her, happy. 
STANLEY (to dog, like "traitor") Judas. 
GINGER Hello, Stanley. 
She smiles at him. He smiles back, about ready to stick her in the trunk of her car. 
ROBERTS Hamlet was a Dane. 
AGENT #2 Adane? 
ROBERTS Forget it. 
Roberts sits down in a chair facing Torvalds.     He stares at him a moment, just smiling, then... 
ROBERTS Why would the number one cracker in the world risk life imprisonment to enter the continental U.S.? 
LAWYER My client has repeatedly reserved his right not answer any questions at this time. 
Torvalds looks at Roberts' badge and says something in Finnish, the only recognizable word being "Roberts." The attorney and Torvalds both laugh. Roberts looks at the attorney. 
(CONTINUED) 
34   CONTINUED:    (2)                                           34 
LAWYER He told me to tell Mister Roberts that he is quite fond of 'The X-Files.' 
Again they smile. Roberts looks at the lawyer's cup of steaming coffee and with one finger pushes it over into the lawyer's lap. 
ROBERTS You need another cup of coffee -- 
LAWYER (jumping up in great pain) Goddammit! 
Roberts grabs him by the collar and slams him into the wall, then pushes him out the door with a kick in the ass. He grabs the briefcase and tosses it out after him and locks the door. 
He turns on Torvalds, smacking him across the face. He pushes him into the wall and holds his badge in front of him. 
ROBERTS Until a year ago I was head of the largest task force on cyber- criminals in the entire world. But, I burned out. It happens. I snapped. I shot a suspect in the fucking hand. Accident. Do you know how hard it is to work a keyboard with one hand? 
TORVALDS Whatever you can do to me, he can do worse. I'm already dead. The only place I stand a chance is back in my country. I have friends there. 
ROBERTS I tell you what, you tell me what I want to know and I guarantee you'll be on the next flight to Finland. First class. Courtesy of the U.S. Government. 
Torvalds thinks quietly. 
35   INT. VIEWING ROOM - NIGHT                                        35 
Two FBI agents (BAD AGENTS #1 & 2) watch the interrogation through a two-way mirror. One of the agents looks surprisingly like Gabriel's merc that carried the young blonde girl killed outside the bank earlier. 
TORVALDS (V.O.) (over speaker) I'll tell you what I know. 
The Agents look at each other.    Bad Agent #1 dials his cell phone. 
BAD AGENT #1 (into his cell) Yes, this is Assistant Director Joy, would you find Agent Roberts. It's important that I speak with him as soon as possible. Thank you. 
INT. FBI INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 
ROBERTS Who is he? 
36   EXT. PRAGUE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                                    36 
A yellow Lamborghini Diablo drives up. In SLOW MOTION Gabriel steps out of the car, wind whipping his full- length, black Gucci overcoat. 
TORVALDS (V.O.) He exists in a world beyond your world. What we only fantasize, he does. He lives a life where nothing is beyond him. 
37   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT                                  37 
TORVALDS But it is all an act.

TORVALDS (V.O.) For all his charisma and charm. For all his wealth and expensive toys. 
-- exchanging kisses and the lingering of hands, as he slides through parting seas of beautiful people. 
TORVALDS (V.O.) Beneath it all he is a driven, unflinching, calculating machine, who takes what he wants, when he wants, then disappears --

TORVALDS (V.O.) I fly to where I am to meet him. He sends one of his people to meet me. 
A BOEING 777 SCREAMS overhead. We TILT DOWN. Stanley and Ginger walk out of LAX. A white LIMO IDLES directly in front of them. 
Stanley is wearing a black T-shirt which proclaims in large white letters across his chest, in true Scarlet Letter fashion, "LOSER!" 
A.D. JOY (V.O.) What do you mean? 
ROBERTS You didn't call me? 
A.D. JOY (V.O.) You just called me... 
Realization slowly hits him, he drops the phone and runs from the room. 
51   INT. HALLWAY - SAME TIME                                          51 
Roberts runs down the hall and into: 
52   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT                                   52 
Roberts finds Torvalds and his attorney dead.     Roberts looks into the mirror. 
Six clean bullet holes perforate his reflection. 
ROBERTS Shit! 
53   INT. PRAGUE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                                     53 
A huge, lavish, converted theater in downtown Los Angeles. A 21st Century version of 54 on equal overdoses of steroids and acid. 
54   INT. VIP SECTION - NIGHT                                          54 
Stanley and Ginger walk into a large area with individual private booths in small rooms around the perimeter. The rooms have the ability to be closed off by drawing huge, thick velvet drapes. 
(CONTINUED) 
54   CONTINUED:                                                     54 
GINGER I wish you'd let me buy you a suit. 
STANLEY I'm happy with what I'm wearing. 
GINGER You have no self-esteem, Stanley. 
STANLEY (dryly) I know. 
They walk into one of the booths in the back. Sitting around a large, oval table is our antihero, Gabriel Shear, surrounded by a handful of his crew and a gaggle of beautiful model-types. 
Ginger kisses Gabriel and with a healthy exchange of fluids, then... 
GINGER Miss me? 
Gabriel smiles, then looks back at Stanley. 
GINGER Gabriel, Stanley. Stanley, Gabriel. 
Gabriel just stares. 
GABRIEL (very familiar) Big Stan. Nice suit. 
STANLEY Thanks. 
GABRIEL You know, they say it's the clothes that make the man... 
STANLEY You buy it? 
GABRIEL Hope not. (then) Buy you a drink?

STANLEY I flew fifteen hundred miles for this meeting, how 'bout we get to the point. 
GABRIEL Actually you flew 1500 miles for 100 grand. But that's not the point. 
Stanley sits down.    Gabriel pours Stan a glass of Crown. 
GABRIEL I heard this story about this young hacker who made a virus that broke the F.B.I.'s Carnivore program that was actively reading every subscriber's E-mail and scrambled the systems. He did what the federal judges wouldn't do and kept the government out of our Privacy. 
STANLEY I think I heard that. Story is he went to jail and the federal Carnivore program is back in full swing. It was a real tragedy. What can I do for you? 
Changing the subject. 
GABRIEL Stanley, meet Helga. 
Gabriel smiles. 
The beautiful WOMAN to Stanley's right slides closer. 
HELGA (WOMAN) (heavily accented) Hi, Stanley. 
Stanley looks at her, she's a knockout; artificially perfect. He looks back at Gabriel. 
STANLEY Look, I don't have a lot of patience for this -- 
Faster and faster.       "ACCESS DENIED." 
GABRIEL Three... Two... 
"ACCESS DENIED." 
He grabs her head.       She doesn't come up.   The screen flashes: 
"ACCESS DENIED." 
GABRIEL Too bad, Stanley. Ya gotta die. 
Marco puts the silencer to his eye. 
STANLEY Wait... ! 
CLICK. The GUN is empty. Stanley tries to catch his breath. Helga lifts up her head. Everyone laughs. Gabriel walks around the table.

GABRIEL I was just fucking with you, Stan. 
Stanley is pissed. Helga, smiling, kisses him on the cheek. Stanley tries to calm down. He gets up, shoots someone's half-drank drink, zips his pants, then -- 
STANLEY So was I. 
Stanley hits the enter key and spins the computer around. 
CLOSEUP - COMPUTER SCREEN 
"ACCESS GRANTED" appears, and the Department of Defense logo scrolls across the screen.

Stanley gives them all a "fuck you" smile, then stomps out through the curtain.

55   INT. CLUB - REST ROOM - NIGHT                                    55 
Stanley pushes into the bathroom.       He kicks the wastebasket across the room. 
STANLEY Shit! 
He pushes a club kid out of the way of the sink. He turns on the water and washes his face. Slowly he leans his forehead against the mirror. Ginger appears behind him. 
STANLEY What are you looking at? 
GINGER Relax, Stanley. You can do this. 
(CONTINUED) 
55   CONTINUED:                                                      55 
STANLEY Get away from me. 
GINGER I want to help you. 
STANLEY Help? Help what, squeegee my brain off the ceiling? 
GINGER It was just a test, Stan, you passed. 
Ginger pulls out a cigarette and a lighter from her plastic overcoat. 
STANLEY A test... I don't know why I let you talk me into this. I can't believe how desperate I am. 
She exhales toward Stanley. 
GINGER I thought you were here saving your daughter, Stanley. 
He turns around. 
STANLEY (pissed) Look... I'd do anything to get Holly back. But, if I end up in a box or back in jail, then I really can't help her, can I? What I should do, is take my money and go back to court. 
GINGER Back to court? Back to Melissa's gladiators? You throw a hundred grand at her, she'll throw five back at you. It's not about Holly, it's about beating you. You know that. Think, Stanley. 
STANLEY What I'm thinking about is that you're willing to put a gun to my head to see if I can hack -- 
Suddenly three club kids come busting into the bathroom.

Ginger interrupts him by slamming Stan between the urinals and ramming her tongue into his mouth with the kind of wet, aggressive action that takes a movie from PG-13 to an R. 
FBI COMPUTER GEEK #2 Serious piece of talent. 
FBI COMPUTER GEEK #3 Way outta his league. Something's up. 
FBI COMPUTER GEEK #2 You know he also has a ten-year- old daughter, who he's not supposed to see. Maybe that's why he's here. 
Roberts looks at him like he's an idiot. 
FBI COMPUTER GEEK #2 Or maybe not. 
ROBERTS I want to know who that girl is. Pronto. 
Roberts stands. 
ROBERTS And stake out his daughter. 
58   EXT. GABRIEL'S HOUSE - POOL - NIGHT                              58 
The house is at the very top of the hills and the pool hangs off the side of the cliff, way below the house. 
The outer edge appears nonexistent, like the water hangs frozen in air. 
A very hip but very nasty soiree is in progress.    More Ibiza than Hollywood Hills. 
Stanley sits in a chair beside a pool containing a half- dozen beautiful un-clad model-types. 
Gabriel is mingling through the crowd. 
CLOSEUP - STANLEY 
Stanley stares off into the glittering lights of L.A. WIDEN. 
GABRIEL (smiles) So Stan, tell me. How'd you do it? 
STANLEY Do what? 
GABRIEL Break the code. At the club. You broke the entire encryption, a silencer against your eye and your cock in someone's mouth, all in less than sixty seconds. How? 
STANLEY I used a logic bomb, dropped it through the trap door -- 
GINGER No, you didn't. You didn't have time. 
GABRIEL C'mon, you can do better than that. How'd you do it? 
STANLEY I used a password sniffer. 
Gabriel glances at Ginger who shakes her head. 
GINGER Uh uh. 
(CONTINUED) 
58   CONTINUED:                                                      58 
STANLEY Yes, I did -- 
GABRIEL C'mon, Stanley. How'd-you-do-it? 
STANLEY I don't know exactly. I see the numbers. In my head. All my life. I don't answer equations, I just see the answers. Same with code. I can't explain --- 
Ginger eases over to where Stan is sitting. She runs her hands across his shoulders as she moves around him, dancing to the MUSIC. 
GINGER Mozart always said he didn't write music; he just wrote down what he heard in his head. So did Faulkner, just with words. 
GABRIEL (drinking wine) You definitely have a gift, Stan. The most powerful people on the planet are like you. With a laptop and a phone line you can make God look like a thirteen-year-old with a stack of Playboys and a lack of imagination. (beat) C'mere, Stan, let me show you something. 
59   INT. GABRIEL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                              59 
Stanley and Gabriel stand in Gabriel's primo designed pad, staring at an array of supercomputers. 
Stanley stands in front of the six huge flat panels, linked together, in complete awe. 
GABRIEL Pretty impressive, huh. (beat) So... 
STANLEY So? 
(CONTINUED) 
59   CONTINUED:                                                    59 
GABRIEL Here's the deal. I need a worm, Stanley. A hydra, actually. A multi-headed worm to break an encryption and then sniff out latent digital footprints throughout an encrypted network. 
STANLEY What kind of cypher? 
GABRIEL Vernam encryption. 
STANLEY A Vernam's impossible. Its key code is destroyed upon implementation. Not to mention being a true 128 bit encryption. 
GABRIEL Actually, we're talking 512 bit.

60   CONTINUED:                                                     60 
They stare at each sharing a moment of God-only-knows- what, then both break into smiles like two giddy seventh- graders at the local skating rink. 
Stanley nervously clears his throat.    She's got him. 
STANLEY Can I borrow your car? There's something I need to do. 
She reaches down beside the chair, grabs her keys and tosses them to him. Then: 
GINGER If you're going to see your daughter, you might want to reevaluate the way you look. (goes back to her book) Just a thought. 
He looks at her with open mouth amazement. In just 24 hours, she already knows what makes him tick. 
She looks up from her book and winks at him, then returns to her reading. 
61   EXT. NEWTON MONTESSORI SCHOOL - DAY                            61 
A SCHOOL BELL RINGS and three hundred screaming kids of all ages come running from the doors. 
ANGLE ON HOLLY 
Not your average ten-year-old. Even decked out in bell- bottoms and sandals there is something about the way she carries herself that is older; wiser; sadder. 
She walks into a CLOSEUP and scans the driveway. Reflected in her tiny, round lavender shades we see the circular driveway of the school jam-packed with buses and parental types in their M-series Mercedes and their Lexus SUVs. She sighs. We CRANE UP, PANNING LEFT. 
Holly walks to the edge of the street oblivious to the mayhem. She looks up and down the street then slowly drops her backpack and sits down on the curb. She pulls a well-worn copy of William Gibson's Neuromancer from her backpack, and turns up the raging ELECTRONICA from her WALKMAN. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
62   SAME SCENE - LATER                                          62 
Now there is much less pandemonium. No more buses. We CRANE DOWN TO a MEDIUM of Holly still in the exact same spot. Holly sighs, pulls back her headphones and grabs her StarTac from her backpack. She opens the phone and dials. 
63   INT. MALIBU HOUSE - DAY                                     63 
The PHONE RINGS and we PAN AROUND the seemingly empty house, finally COMING TO REST ON the back of the couch. We JIB UP and TILT DOWN. Melissa is passed out in a pool of her own drool. The PHONE continues to RING. 
64   EXT. NEWTON MONTESSORI SCHOOL - DAY                        64 
Holly hits the phone and then presses speed dial. We see "Yellow Cab" scroll across the phone. She hits "SEND." 
MAN (O.S.) Can I give you a lift? 
HOLLY Look, creep, I don't think so -- 
She stands up, ready for a fight. And there, next to her is her father; transformed. Under his arm is a three- foot-tall stuffed giraffe wrapped with a big red bow. 
HOLLY Daddy? (recognition) Daddy! 
She runs to him and wraps her arms around him. 
STANLEY Hey, sweetheart. 
HOLLY Daddy... What are you doing here? I missed you so much. 
STANLEY Me too, baby.    I brought you something. 
He holds the stuffed giraffe to her. 
HOLLY Oh, Daddy. If Mom finds out you're here she's gonna have you thrown back in jail. 
STANLEY It's okay, baby. Let me give you a ride home. 
He grabs her stuff. 
STANLEY C'mon. 
He walks toward Ginger's silver Mercedes CLK which he's borrowing. Holly runs and jumps on his back. They laugh as he carries her to the car. 
65   EXT. MALIBU HOUSE - DAY                                        65 
They sit in the CLK, parked down the street from Holly's house. 
STANLEY You believe in me, right? 
HOLLY Of course, but -- 
STANLEY I've found a way to get you back, sweetheart. It's my one shot and I'm taking it. Just give me a couple of days. 
HOLLY (crying) I don't want anything else to happen to you, Dad. 
STANLEY Holly, everything's going to be okay. You just have to trust me. 
HOLLY (crying) I love you, Daddy. 
Holly quickly kisses him, jumps out and runs, crying, from the car at full speed, with the giraffe. 
DARK SUIT #2 Why didn't you do that earlier, sir? 
Roberts looks at the agent. 
DARK SUIT #2 Sorry, sir. 
ROBERTS Go get him. 
Three of the agents bring Stanley over. 
Stan slides down by the back wheel. 
ROBERTS What are you doing in L.A., Stan? 
STANLEY (catching his breath) Vacationing... 
(CONTINUED)

ROBERTS Why were you running? We just wanted to talk. 
STANLEY Are you arresting me? 
ROBERTS For violating your parole by leaving Texas without permission or for evading a federal agent and almost getting me killed in the process? 
Stan just looks at him. 
ROBERTS No, I'm not. 
STANLEY Then why are we talking? 
ROBERTS Didn't know the court lifted the sanction preventing you from seeing your daughter. 
STANLEY Fuck you. 
ROBERTS You just want to cut through the pleasantries and get down to business? Fine. I can help you with your daughter, Stan. Help me, I'll help you. 
STANLEY You'll have to forgive me, the fact that you put me in jail for 18 months doesn't inspire a lot of trust. 
ROBERTS Whether I agreed with what you did or not, you broke the law, Stanley. 
STANLEY I guess we were both doing what we had to. This was a nice trip down memory lane, but if you're not arresting me... 
(CONTINUED) 
69   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               69 
ROBERTS So, why was it you are in L.A. again? 
STANLEY I told you -- 
ROBERTS -- vacationing. That's right. Ya know it's funny. Axl Torvalds was just here for a vacation, too. Isn't it odd that the two best hackers in the world are here at the same time. 
STANLEY I'm a sucker for Disneyland. (getting up) Tell Torvalds I said hello. 
ROBERTS If you're not careful you can tell him yourself. He's dead. 
Stanley looks at Roberts. 
ROBERTS (to his men) Give him a card. 
They do.   Stan looks at it. 
ROBERTS In case you think of anything else you want to tell me. 
Stan turns to walk off. 
STANLEY (to the agent he elbowed) Sorry about your nose. 
ROBERTS Hey, Stan. 
Stan turns. 
ROBERTS You know, you're in way over your head here. 
(CONTINUED) 
69   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                 69 
STANLEY (walking off) I know. 
ROBERTS It's a long walk back up the hill, Stanley. You want us to give you a lift? 
Stan lifts his middle finger behind him and begins the long journey back up the hill. Roberts collapses into the passenger seat. 
ROBERTS Follow him. 
RANDOM AGENT Yessir. 
Stanley looks at Ginger for a beat. 
STANLEY Actually... 
Ginger stares at Stanley, who turns to look at Gabriel. Gabriel looks at Stan, waiting. 
STANLEY Thought maybe you'd like to see me get you your hydra. 
GABRIEL Get?

Stan walks toward Gabriel. 
STANLEY C'mon. 
Gabriel walks into the hall. Stanley looks back at Ginger who mouths the words "Thank you." Stanley ignores her. Ginger reaches down and grabs a shirt off the bed. 
GABRIEL (O.S.) You look like shit. Ginger kick your ass? 
STANLEY (O.S.) (deadpan) Funny. 
Ginger sighs and tosses her gun onto the bed, then follows them.

Stanley, looking a little rough, sits in front of the huge array of flat-panels. He works quickly. The nitrogen system, an array of hoses winding across the living room floor, intermittently SHOOTS JETS of GAS upwards, dropping the temperature to a livable 85 degrees. Gabriel sits next to Stan. 
Ginger walks in.      She stands behind Stan as he works. 
GINGER Miss me? 
STANLEY Terribly.

STANLEY (V.O.) In the basement and through a file room is the only P.D.P.-10 still active and on the internet, although only a few people know this. It's an I.T.S. machine and kept online just for historical sake. I hid my worm inside it where no one would ever think to look. 
We DOLLY INTO a CLOSEUP ON a large, ominous, dark mainframe.

She runs her hand affectionately across the side of his head and walks out. 
GABRIEL I see you have a groupie. 
SENATOR REISMAN Close the door. 
He does. 
KAPLAN We have a problem. (walking toward desk) Look at these. 
Kaplan spreads out the surveillance photos on the desk. The Senator looks up at Kaplan.

Reisman, who now stands in a windowless room. The only furniture is a desk on which rests a small laptop and what appears to be a speaker. An OPERATOR sits at the desk, while Kaplan hovers in the b.g. 
REISMAN We have him yet? 
COMMUNICATION (OPERATOR) He's coming online now, sir. Ready. 
As Reisman speaks the Communication guy types. 
REISMAN We have a problem --

Gabriel and Marco sit at the same type of apparatus, a merc at the laptop. Reisman's dialogue comes out of the SPEAKER, but it is no longer Reisman, it is a COMPUTERIZED VOICE.

Gabriel looks at the surveillance photos as they come up. We INTERCUT as they speak. 
GABRIEL (irritated but respectful) Senator, I sincerely hope you did not contact me and jeopardize the safety of me and my men for this. 
REISMAN Goddamn right I did. You know where I got that? From the deputy director of the F.B.I. He thought I might be interested. 
GABRIEL Sir, with all due respect. Do you think there is any aspect of this operation I am not fully aware of? 
REISMAN We are aborting the operation and securing alternative means of finance elsewhere. 
GABRIEL What? 
REISMAN We are aborting this operation. Take a vacation. 
GABRIEL A vacation?   Have I ever failed you, sir? 
(CONTINUED) 
86   CONTINUED:                                                 86 
REISMAN That's not the point. 
GABRIEL It's my point. Senator, this operation is going forward. 
REISMAN You understand what you are saying? 
GABRIEL Everything is under control. 
He disconnects. 
87   INT. REISMAN'S HOUSE - DAY                                 87 
Reisman turns to Kaplan. 
REISMAN (regretful) Do it. Terminate the Vortex. 
KAPLAN Yessir. (beat) Sir, he does work for us. 
REISMAN Excuse us. (as the Communication guy leaves) Son, let's say you have a 200- pound Rottweiler. He loves you, and it's his job to protect you. But if he ever bites you, even once, you gotta put him down. You can't have an uncontrollable weapon running unchecked in your back yard. He becomes a liability. You never know who he might bite next. 
KAPLAN Yessir, I understand. 
88   INT. GABRIEL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                 88 
Stanley works at the keyboard. He reaches for his glass of wine and it is empty. He grabs the bottle. It, too, has been drained. He sighs and walks into the kitchen. 
89   INT. GABRIEL'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                         89 
Stan walks to the fridge. Opens the door. No wine. He sighs. He closes the door and walks off toward the wine cellar. 
GABRIEL Hold the wheel. 
Gabriel reaches in the passenger floorboard and pulls up a duffel bag. He unzips it, and withdraws what the Marines call a SAW -- a Belgian-designed machine gun, compact but with 1500 rounds of Swiss cheese action per minute, powerful enough for the U.S. to replace the M-60. 
STANLEY Shit, it's blocked. 
Gabriel looks behind them, another black Suburban has blocked them in. The one from the other side and a third comes toward them down the alley. 
GABRIEL Keep it straight. 
(CONTINUED) 
92   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                92 
The speedometer needle is pegged at 0 as they SCREAM backwards. 
Gabriel unfolds the stock and then withdraws a 100-round box wrapped in white tape and printed with AP. He clips it and pulls back the bolt. He grabs the wheel from Stan. 
GABRIEL It's just rough when you grow up lovin' James Bond movies. Don't worry, Stanley, it'll be over soon. 
ANGLE ON LAMBO 
As the Diablo slams backwards into the Suburban at sixty mph. Bam. 
Gabriel unbuckles himself and stands up through the open roof and UNLOADS FULL-AUTO into the Suburban. The armor- piercing SHELLS PENETRATE the Armalite GLASS, RIPPING the occupants to shreds. 
Gabriel turns, FIRING at the other Suburban. 
GABRIEL Drive, drive! 
Stanley slides under Gabriel as Gabriel steps into the passenger side. The wheels spin, the Lambo is wedged under the Suburban. 
GABRIEL Go, go! 
Gabriel continues to BLAST FULL-AUTO, tearing the Suburban to shrapnel. 
STANLEY I am! 
Finally the mortally wounded but still kicking Lamborghini tears free of the Suburban and rockets head- on toward the other. Stanley drives like a maniac. 
Gabriel RIPS it on FULL-AUTO, meatloafing the driver. The Suburban veers into the wall. Smack. 
Stanley whips beside it and Gabriel STRAFES down the side, opening it up. Stan whips right onto a main street. 
(CONTINUED) 
92   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                92 
More Suburbans head at them. Stan SCREAMS left into another alley. Through the cross streets whipping by at 100 mph, we see Suburbans parallel to them. 
Stan cranks his wheel right. 
STANLEY Shit! 
GABRIEL (changing out a clip) Keep your cool, Stanley. 
The Lambo rolls to a stop and Gabriel hops out, running at the Suburbans. 
After a moment of all-out GI Joe-style blitzkrieg, it's over. 
Gabriel walks to a body lying in the street.    He turns over the body and looks at the face. 
GABRIEL Goddamit.   I knew it. 
Gabriel walks back to one of the burning Suburbans where Stanley stands. 
GABRIEL Get in the fucking car, Stanley. 
STANLEY I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. 
Gabriel pulls out his H&K, points it at Stanley. 
GABRIEL You're on my good side and you want to stay there. Stanley, I like you, but don't confuse kindness with weakness. So, get in the fuckin' car. I need my hydra. 
FADE TO BLACK.

Stanley is working at his terminal. 
GINGER Stanley?   You alright? 
STANLEY What do you think? I just watched that maniac murder ten men in the street. I'm just fucking great. It doesn't matter if I get my daughter back if I'm dead. Even if I do survive this, who's gonna keep me out of jail? You? 
She walks over to him and kneels down, places her hand on his leg, looks up at him. 
REISMAN The F.B.I. was watching you -- 
GABRIEL I told you there was nothing that I was unaware of -- 
REISMAN That's why we're here. You are too arrogant, too aggressive -- 
GABRIEL You have misplaced your loyalties, Senator. You have sold America out. I am a patriot, and patriotism does not have a four-year shelf life. Unfortunately, politicians do. 
Gabriel pulls out his H&K, dangling it by his side. 
REISMAN (arrogantly) And what are you going to do with that? 
GABRIEL Thomas Jefferson once shot a man on the White House lawn for treason, Senator. You tried to execute me in the name of politics, now I execute you in the name of the people. 
Gabriel shoots Reisman in the chest.     He falls into the water.

His hands fly across the computer keys, he slides in a zip disk, transfers the file, and runs for the door.

A snazzy, sweat-suited Kaplan walks out to his shiny new silver Porsche, racquet ball racquet flipping in hand. He's so downright happy in his confidence that he is on the fast track to political Valhalla, due to his handling of this Gabriel Shear debacle, he is whistling. 
He CLICKS the Porsche key, unlocking the driver's door, tosses in his racquet and climbs in.

Smiling, he turns the key.

Gabriel turns and sees Stanley. 
GABRIEL Stan, how are you? 
STANLEY Fine.

Stan pulls out the zip disk and hands it to Gabriel who dials his cell phone.

STANLEY It's okay.    I love you, baby. 
Marco stares at Stanley as they walk out.

Gabriel jerks out his weapon and jams it against Stan's head as he and Marco roll around on the ground. 
STANLEY Won't do you any good. The money jumps every 60 seconds from one numbered account to another and will for the next ten years. 'Course it wasn't supposed to happen for another six hours. The power surge must have scrambled the internal clock. But, you kill me and you never get a single dollar. 
Gabriel eases up, wheels spinning at millions of RPMs.

STANLEY You let the hostages go and then I'll tell you where and when you can extract the money. We all walk away, nobody gets hurt. The accounts are encrypted with a 1024 bit cipher. Even I can't break through the fire wall. It's my act of God policy. (beat) Deal? 
GABRIEL I'm thinking. 
A very tense moment passes.      Gabriel looks around.   He has an idea. 
GABRIEL Tell ya what.    No deal. 
Marco pulls a length of towing cable from one of the Hummer's winches and throws the line over one of the 30- foot-high ceiling buttresses. 
Gabriel grabs the cable as it comes down as two mercs rush in and grab Stanley, one placing a knife to his throat. 
GABRIEL Marco!   Grab Agent Sculley! 
Marco grabs Ginger and drags her kicking, fighting, over to where Gabriel stands, brandishing the cable. 
STANLEY No, don't do this. 
Stanley struggles like there is no tomorrow. Gabriel hooks the end into a noose with the tow hook, and puts it over Ginger's head, pulling it taut around her neck. He cuts the cable-tie loose. She digs at them with her fingers.

GABRIEL In all reality, Stan, she has you to thank for this. That first night in Prague you broke the D.O.D. database that contained her true identity. She's D.E.A., Stan, but without you, I never would have known. 
STANLEY (freaking) What are you doing? Stop! 
GABRIEL String up the D.E.A. bitch. 
Marco hits the power switch. Ginger is yanked up into the air, hanging twenty feet above the floor. 
STANLEY Just let her down. I'll do whatever you want. 
GABRIEL One. 
STANLEY Let her go. 
Stanley jumps up and runs over to Marco.        Gabriel puts his gun to the back of Stanley's head. 
STANLEY Now, goddammit, it's done.   Let her go! 
Gabriel looks at one of his boys who is checking it with a different laptop. He nods. Marco drops the girl. 
GABRIEL Well, that was fun.

GABRIEL (V.O.) I don't think any of us want a repeat of this morning. Keep at least a hundred yards from this bus at all times and I want the airspace for five miles clear. 
127    INT. BUS - MOVING - DAY                                     127 
GABRIEL (dropping the mic and turning to the hostages) Ladies and gentlemen, we will be in your lives for approximately 55 more minutes. This bus has just become your new yard. So sit back, think happy thoughts, and this will be over before you can say 'cat in the hat.' 
Gabriel, smiling, turns to Stanley. 
GABRIEL Whaddaya think, Stanley? 
The bus hurtles down a road toward a bridge over the LA river. 
CLOSEUP ON ONE OF HOSTAGE'S EYES 
WIDER 
One of the mercs in the front speaks French again. Gabriel looks around. He smiles. 
GABRIEL Listen... 
Faintly, we can hear powerful ROTORS APPROACHING. 
GABRIEL Gentlemen... 
Stanley looks out the window as two of the mercs scramble through hatches in the roof. 
136    OMITTED                                                            136

137    EXT. SKY - DAY                                               137 
A huge black Sikorsky sky crane drops out of the sky. It has matched speed with the bus dragging four crane cables under it. 
137A   EXT. BUS (MOVING) - DAY                                      137A 
Within moments, as the bus speeds onto the bridge, the mercs on the roof have hooked the cables to the four hard-points welded into the bus' substructure for just this purpose. The mercs drop back into... 
138    INT. BUS - DAY                                               138

139    EXT. STREET - DAY                                            139 
The bus is lifted from the bridge into the air.

Roberts, hauling ass after the bus, sees the Sikorsky. 
ROBERTS Well why the fuck not.

140A   EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - DAY                              140A 
The SWAT teams sit and just continue to wait for Gabriel, who will never show up. 
140B   OMITTED                                                     140B 
140C   EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - DAY                             140C 
Joy and Agent Thomas come SCREECHING up at the airport. Agent Thomas's PHONE RINGS and he answers it. Joy walks over to the SWAT leader. 
A.D. JOY Everything in place? 
AGENT TORRES We're ready, sir. 
A.D. JOY Good -- 
AGENT THOMAS (running up) -- sir... 
A.D. JOY Yeah? 
AGENT THOMAS I don't think they're coming. 
A.D. JOY What do you mean you don't think they're coming? 
AGENT THOMAS (listening to the phone) The bus was just lifted off the street by a giant helicopter. 
A.D. JOY (freaking) What?!? 
141    INT. BUS - DAY                                              141 
GABRIEL (laughing) The only way to fly, huh, Stanley. 
Gabriel says something in French into the radio. 
142    EXT. L.A. SKY - DAY                                         142

143   INT. BUS - DAY                                          143 
The bus flies through the canyons of the downtown buildings as it continues to lift.

166   INT. BUILDING - DAY                                              166

167   EXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOF - DAY                                       167 
Sitting there on a helipad is an evil-looking, matte- black, Explorer helicopter. 
Gabriel and his men walk off the bus toward the waiting helicopter. Gabriel turns back to Stanley who is standing on the stairs of the bus. 
We hear the sound of hundreds of SIRENS APPROACHING. 
GABRIEL Well, Stanley, gotta fly. Take care of that little girl. Maybe I'll see you again one day. 
STANLEY It can't end like this.     You can't get away. 
(CONTINUED) 
167    CONTINUED:                                                        167 
GABRIEL C'mon, Stan. Everything doesn't always end the way you think it will. (beat, then) 'Sides, audiences love happy endings. 
Gabriel strides away. We hear the WHINE of the EXPLORER as it does its final POWER UP for lift off. 
Stanley looks around the bus futilely for some way to stop Gabriel. Stan can hear the cavalry about to arrive. The Explorer slowly lifts upward. 
168    EXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOF - DAY                                        168 
The Explorer shoots upward into the sky.

Stan looks around, all the hostages look back at him. Stanley sees one of the Stinger missile launchers, broken free of its box. 
169B   EXT. BUS                                                          169B 
Roberts runs onto the roof and sees Stanley who has the STINGER to his shoulder. He hits the "on" switch and it WHINES TO LIFE. 
He sights through the scope as the EXPLORER SCREAMS away and pulls the trigger. The MISSILE RIPS OUT of the tube and flies toward the EXPLORER. 
BOOM. 
The MISSILE EXPLOSION combined with the fuel creates a tremendous fireball. 
Roberts runs and tackles Stanley to the ground. Suddenly, SWAT GUYS dressed in full combat gear including masks that cover their faces surround them. 
They cuff them.    One of them almost steps on Stanley's face.

169B   CONTINUED:                                                    169B 
ROBERTS I'm F.B.I... 
SWAT GUY (ignoring him) Check the rest of the hostages, we'll come back for them. (CONTINUED) 
169B   CONTINUED:                                                       169B 
Stretchers and EMT medics run into the bus. We CRANE UP. And see the absolute pandemonium of ambulances leaving and police cars arriving. 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN: 
170    INT. FORENSIC LAB - NIGHT                                        170 
We see DOCTOR MICHEALS leaning over what is left of Gabriel's barely recognizable burned upper torso and head. Stan and Roberts walk into the room through the metal doors and stop at the end of the table. Dr. Micheals nervously looks up at Stanley and steps back. Stanley looks down at the body. 
STANLEY Are we sure this is Gabriel? 
Micheals walks over to a light-board on the wall and flicks it on. A full dental X-ray glows. Micheals hangs another over-top of it. 
DOCTOR MICHEALS The body's dentals exactly match the dentals the Israeli government sent us for an ex-Mossad agent named Gabriel Shears. 
CLOSEUP ON FACE 
It is indeed Gabriel a.k.a. Gabriel Shear. 
WIDER 
ROBERTS It sure looks like Gabriel Shear. What the hell was he doing in that bank? 
STANLEY What about Ginger? 
TORRES We searched all the hospitals and morgues but we haven't been able to find her body yet. 
STANLEY You can't find her body? 
176   BACK TO ROBERTS (PRESENT)                                      176 
Roberts looks at him inquisitively. 
ANGLE ON STANLEY 
As a wry Indiana Jones smirk slowly crosses his face.   He slowly shakes his head. 
ROBERTS Cheer up, Stan, we got him. You're a hero. 
STANLEY Yeah that's me. Hero. 
They walk to the door and out. 
ROBERTS I was wrong about you, Stanley. I wanted you to know that. You know, you should take your daughter on vacation. Relax a little, you're lucky to be alive. 
Stanley slaps Roberts on the arm and walks out. 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN: 
177   INT. CREDIT SUISSE (MONTE CARLO) - DAY                         177 
A WOMAN who looks surprisingly like Ginger with blonde hair and dark shades saunters into the Credit Suisse main bank in Monte Carlo. 
She walks up to a desk and sits down in front of a young female BANK EXECUTIVE. Both women speak in French with SUBTITLES. 
WOMAN I would like to transfer money between my employer's accounts. 
BANK EXECUTIVE Certainly. May I have your employer's account number and password, please? 
The Woman slides a piece of paper across the desk as she casually lights a cigarette. 
(CONTINUED) 
177   CONTINUED:                                                       177 
BANK EXECUTIVE (looking at the account number, realizing who she is dealing with) Oh, of course. You realize, how should I say, there is a substantial amount of money in that account. 
The sexy Woman smiles. 
WOMAN That's why I'm here. My employer doesn't like drawing attention to himself. He likes to keep a low profile. 
The Bank Executive keys in the account numbers. 
BANK EXECUTIVE Of course. Would you feel more comfortable dealing with the bank president? 
WOMAN (exhaling) Would you? 
BANK EXECUTIVE Yes... 
WOMAN Get him. 
BANK EXECUTIVE Right away. A glass of Cristal while you... Wait a moment... 
WOMAN What? 
BANK EXECUTIVE There seems to have been a series of large withdrawals out of this account. 
WOMAN That's impossible. 
The Woman spins around the terminal. 
The Executive and the Woman look at each other in astonishment, then both look back at the screen.

We PUSH INTO A CLOSEUP OF the terminal.   Then THROUGH it.

We PUSH INTO a CLOSEUP of the terminal. Then THROUGH it. We SHOOT THROUGH the system of wires and microchips, DOWN and THROUGH T1 lines, ACROSS the world at light speed, and EXIT the computer world FROM... 
179   INT. DINER - SOMEWHERE IN ARIZONA - DAY                         179 
The screen of Stanley's laptop. 
HOLLY (O.S.) Everything okay, Dad? 
Stanley, sitting at a booth, looks up from his laptop at Holly who was studying a road map of Arizona. 
STANLEY Everything's fine. Just making the last of some charitable donations..

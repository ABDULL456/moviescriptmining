Suddenly there's a popping sound and the power fails for a moment. 
BLUE What happened? 
GREEN She must've bucked. 
Two men are walking at a rapid pace: CAZ DOLOWICZ, Super- vising Towerman, an overweight man in his fifties, and a PLUMBER, a short man dressed in overalls and a cap, carry- ing a long wooden box of wrenches; he struggles to keep up with Dolowicz. The time is SUPERIMPOSED:

PLUMBER What's the goddam hurry? 
CAZ I told you -- one of my towermen dropped his wedding ring-down the john. 
PLUMBER Yeah, but what're we runnin' for? 
CAZ 
(RUNNING) Who's runnin'? They pass the Nedick's stand and Caz pushes through a gate marked: "TO SUPER'S OFFICE". 
PLUMBER How come that gate ain't locked? 
CAZ Who's gonna steal a subway train?

CAZ That's it up ahead -- those windows. 
PLUMBER What kinda tower? They've come to the door of the Tower Room. They turn, go up some steps and disappear inside.

INT. TOWER ROOM 
A long, unadorned room with a row of desks with phones, and a door marked "TOILET". Several TOWERMEN (and MRS. JENKINS, a black Towerwoman) sit at the desks before the flashing phone consoles, talking to dispatchers, trainmasters and other Towers. The predominant feature of the room, however, i is the electronic Model Board, stretched high across one wall, recording in colored slashes of light the movements of every train that passes through the sector, all of it superimposed on a painted map showing the line's track routes and stations. One of the Towermen, MARINO, rushes over to Caz as he and the Plumber enter. 
MARINO Jesus Christ, Cazâ¢, you picked a helluva day to be late -- 
CAZ You wanted a plumber down here, didn't you? Whose goddam wedding ring was it? 
MARINO 
(POINTING) Who else? Mrs. Jenkins. 
MRS. JENKINS I'm sorry, Mr. Dolowicz -- it just slipped off. 
CAZ What were you doin'r with your hand in the john, anyway? 
MRS. JENKINS (indignant). My hand-wasn't in the john, Mr. Dolowicz -- it was over the john. 
CAZ What's the difference? (to the Plumber) Go fish it out, will ya? As the Plumber heads off, Caz turns to Marino. 
CAZ The classification's been open to women for only a month and already we're in the goddam toilet! (glancing at the 
BOARD) What the hell's that? 
CONTINUED 
MARINO That's what I've been tryin' -to tell you, Caz -- a southbound local. He's laying down between 28th and 23rd. 
CAZ What the hell for? 
MARINO Dunno yet. 
CAZ How long? 
MARINO Couple-three minutes. Command Center's been trying to raise him but so far he don't answer the radio. Jesus, Caz -- why don't he answer the radio? 
CAZ Take it easy, Marino -- there's lots o' reasons. Maybe he jumped a ball and hadda leave the cab to reset a tripper -- or a door got hung and he hadda go fix it. Any- thing more serious and he'd'a called in for a car knocker. 
MARINO It's been too long, Caz -- 
CAZ Then maybe his radio's busted and the sonuvabitch is too lazy to climb down and use a telephone! I'm gonna write him up for.this, goddammit -- I'm gonna have his assn 
TOWERMAN Hey -- it's moving! Everyone wheels around to stare up at the Board. 
CAZ For Jesus Christ sake! The dumb bastard's moving backwards!!

RADIO (CORRELL) Grand Central Tower -- this is the Desk Trainmaster -- who the fuck's in charge down there? Caz glances at Mrs. Jenkins, grins, and leans over a desk to flip on a mike.

CAZ On my way, Frank. 
(AN AFTERTHOUGHT) Oh, and Frank -- please don't say "fuck" anymore on the radio -- we got some ladies down here now -- and you know how it is with ladies, Frank--- the cunts don't like it. He flips off the key and walks out the door.

BLUE Get going, Mr. Green. Green nods and goes to the front, uses a key to slide open the storm door, steps out and closes it again, then jumps down onto the tracks. 
BLUE Motorman -- come here. 
DOYLE Yes, sir? 
BLUE I want you to walk uptrack and collect all the passengers in the nine cars we out loose, and lead them back to the 28th St. Station -- is that clear?

BLUE Please be quiet -- nothing's going to happen if you do as you're told. Get going, Motorman. As Doyle leaves at one end of the train, Green reappears at the other. 
BLUE All right, Mr. Green? 
GREEN All power's out between 14th and 33rd Streets on all four tracks, local and express, north- and southbound. r

PRES COTT Each train is identified by the name of its terminus and the time of its departure --thus, an express leaving Woodlawn at 6:30 P.M. would be Woodlawn Six Three Oh, while on its return trip its new destination might be Flathush Eight Two Five. I hope you're memorizing all this junk -- I'm going to ask questions later. He has said this within earshot of a DISPATCHER who now reacts.

COMMISSIONER Mrs. Mayor -- 
CONTROLLER Hi, Jess -- 
CHAIRMAN Good afternoon.-- 
JESSIE Coffee for everybody -- and some cake? 
WARREN Uh -- better skip it, Jessie -- we're running a little short of time. We all know what's going on underground, right? So the main issue is whether to pay the ransom or not. All the rest is secondary. Phil? What do you think? 
COMMISSIONER Well -- we're fully mobilized -- I can go down there any time you say with enough firepower to wipe out an army -- but I can't guarantee the safety of the 'hostages.

BLUE Pull in your feet -- someone's liable to get hurt. The. Hippie looks up at him, smiles, and slides his feet back. Blue continues until he comes to Grey. He speaks quietly to him. 
BLUE Stop fooling around with that girl, Mr. Grey. 
GREY What's the big deal? She's a twenty buck a trick hooker.

MAYOR Warren, for Chrissake, I'm sick as a goat. What's the point?

BLUE Over and out. He gives the mike a strong tug and-snaps the wire. 
BLUE I want this train moving in thirty seconds. Tell Mr. Brown and Mr. Grey they.rcan cut the emergency brake cords. Green leaves the cab. Blue examines the gimmick one last time, then follows Green out. 
INT. SUBWAY CAR 
CLOSE SHOT - EMERGENCY BRAKE CORD as the rope with the red wooden handle, which dangles some six inches from a hole in the ceiling of the car, is cut by a pair of clippers inserted into the hole. CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Brown, standing on a seat behind the Motorman's cab.

OLD MAN Hippie -- they don't call them beatniks any more. 
CO-ED They don't call them hippies any more, either. 
MOTHER How can they let policemen dress like that? 
OLD NAN I That's his job -- he's in cognito. 
W.A.S.P. He's also dead, most likely. We were moving pretty fast by the time he jumped o,;t. 
SALESMAN They're trained to do that. 
PIMP Jump headfirst off a subway? Shiiit.

CONTINUED 
MOTHER Where do you think they're taking us now? 
OLD LIAD Don't worry -- they'll let us go pretty soon. The Hooker has been looking around with growing anxiety and now, she stands up. 
HOOXER You dumb bastards -- can't anybody count?! They all four got off.-- there's nobody driving the fucking train! There's a moment's silence as everyone digests this news. Then the Mother screams. 
111T. ASTOR PLACE PLATFORM as the lone car hurtles through the station. 
INT. TUNNEL - HIPPIE 
He raises himself on one elbow and shakes his head. He wipes some blood off his face and looks at his fingers. 
BLUE'S VOICE Remove your coats -- turn inside- out -- and put back on. He looks off. 
EMERGENCY EXIT - HIPPIE'S POV as Blue, Green, Brown and Grey take off their coats and begin turning them inside out -- illuminated by the over- head bulb. 
CLOSE SHOT - HIPPIE He blink, still in a foa. He lcoks at his empty hand for. a moment, trying to remember what should still be in it but isn't. Then he begins groping around on the ground, and whispering to himself, barely audibly. 
HIPPIE Gun -- gotta find my gun -- 
NED. SHOT - BLUE, GREEN, BROWN & GREY as they are putting their coats on again. Grey's is now a light beige poplin; Brown's a mediumn grey with fur collar; Green's a tan herringbone ;weed; Blue's a salt and pepper Donegal.

RADIO (JEN_'CINS ) Pelham One Two Three reported halfway, between Astor Place and Bleeker, speed increasing -- 
DANIELS Christ, they're gaining on us! 
PRESCOTT it has something Co do with that short move they surprised us with -- from 28th to 17th St. -- 
DANIELS What does? 
PRESCOTT Their scheme -- it's tied up some- how with that move -- it has to bet But why'd they do it? 
DANIELS I give up. 
PRESCOTT To get away from the cops in the tunnel, that's what they said -- all right, why not? Suppose they were doing something they didn't want anybody to see? 
CONTINUED 
DANIELS Like what? 
CLOSE SHOT - PRESCOTT 
PRESCOTT (softly and evenly) Like getting off the train. Daniels --- turn around, we're going back. 
WIDER ANGLE Including Daniels. 
DANIELS Like hell we are. 
PRESCOTT They're not on the train -- I'm sure of it! 
DANIELS Look, Presoctt -- I'm the one who suggested that in the first place -- but you shot me down -- something about a 'dead man's feature" -- 
PRESCOTT They figured out how to beat it -- that's their aanl,, -- that's what they started with! Daniels considers for an instant, then turns to the Driver. 
(TURNING) What's that? 
I PIMP They all green. 
THE TUNNEL (UNDERCRANKED) SHOOTING straight ahead from the-front of the train. Nothing but green lights ahead as the train races along. 
INT. TUNNEL - HIPPIE 
Propped up now against a pillar, straining to look at something, off. 
HIJACKERS - HIPPIE'S POV Blue and Brown are tying the second money vest on Green, then help him on with his shirt 4nd coat. 
MED. SHOT - HIPPIE He returns his attention to the business of locating his gun. He scrapes the heel of an extended leg (to his extreme discomfort) along the ground hoping to discover it -- and does. Seeing it, he now goes through the painful exercise of reaching for it -- finally managing this, too. Now, lifting one knee as a gun mount, he holds the revolver in both hands and starts to take aim. 
HIJACKERS - HIPPIE'S POV with the gun in the foreground, its sight being shifted as the three men are preparing to leave through the emergency exit. Now the Hippie's vision (FOCUS) blurs for a moment, and when it clears, Green has already disappeared through the door and Brown is right behind him. The gunsight centers on Brown's broad back -- and the gun fires. Brown convulses and topples backwards. 
EXT. BROADWAY - DAY 
The Squad Car, racing uptown now. 
INT. SQUAD CAR 
DANIELS You'd better be right about this, 
PRESCOTT -- 
P RES COTT Even if I am, we're probably gonna be too late. 
INT. TUNNEL 
Blue stands behind a pillar, his gun in hand, peering into the darkness, trying to locate the marksman. Green is in the well of the emergency exit, beside the metal ladder that leads up through a grate and out onto the street. Between them, before the open doorway to the well, Brown's body lies face up on the ground. Green now gestures for Blue to come across the open area separating then. 
GREEN Come on -- i 
BLUE I'd never make it -- I 
(POINTING DOWNTRACK) It came from down there someplace -- I've got to. get him. Go on 
UP -- 1 Green hesitates, looks up the ladder, looks back at Blue. 
GREEN I -- I'll wait for you -- 1 Blue looks at him fora moment, then checks his pistol and, slowly, steps out from behind the pillar. A shot rings out immediately and the ricochet off the pillar zings loudly. Blue calmly fires twice at the muzzle flash. 
MED. SHOT - HIPPIE Both shots have connected, one hitting his arm and sending the pistol flying away, the other into his upper chest, below the right shoulder. He topples over, sprawling across one rail, onto the roadbed. 
ICED, SHOT - BLUE He has stepped back behind his pillar again to listen. Silence. 
CONTINUED 
GREEN Did you hit, him -- ?! 
BLUE Quiet! He listens again, then leaves his pillar, and hurries downtrack to the next where he again waits and listens, 
MED. SHOT - HIPPIE Inadvertently, he groans. 
MED. SHOT - BLUE He has heard. Now he steps out from behind the pillar and starts forward to the next, a-little more secure. 
INT. WALL ST. PLATFORM 
as the single car flashes through the station. 
THE TUNNEL (UNDERCRANKED) As before, SHOOTING straight ahead from the front of the train. Still nothing but green lights. 
INT. FIRST CAR 
Most of the passengers are now packed at the front of the car, staring out at the track-ahead. 
W.A.S.P. Where are the goddam red lights?! 
SALESMAN There aren't any! 
MOTHER We're not stopping -- we're going to be killed! i OLD MAN There's gonna be a red light -- there has to be! 
HOOKER And what if there isn't -- ?! 
OLD MAN 
(LESS SURE) There has to be -- 
INT. TUNNEL - BLUE 
Now he can see the Hippie lying across the track ahead. He slowly starts toward him, calm, his pistol at his side. 
BLUE Mr. Green -- ! It's all right! Go on up -- I'll be right with you -- ! 
MED. SHOT - GREEN as he climbs up the ladder and starts pushing up the grating above his head.' 
MED. SHOT - HIPPIE Barely conscioous, unable to move, he watches Blue approach. 
MED. SHOT - BLUE as he continues walking, unhurried, toward the Hippie. Finally he arrives, stops, looks down at the injured man. 
BLUE You were on the train. Are you a cop? Almost imperceptibly, the Hippie nods -- just once. 
BLUE Then the Mayor will come to your funeral. X He lifts his gun to aim and fire and the Hippie manages to turn his head away. Then there's a shot -- and Blue crumples to the ground, dead. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
I as Prescott comes up and stands looking down at Blue's body. Then he turns his attention to the Hippie, bending beside him. All he can see is the long blond hair. 
PRESCOTT I'll have an ambr lance here in no time at all, Miss -- every- thing's going to be all right.

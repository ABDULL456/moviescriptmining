ARAC ATTACK! 
FADE IN: 
EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 
A rabbit hops across rough terrain. 
EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT 
Three trucks from Chemical Technologies carry barrels of toxic waste. They pass a sign: PROSPERITY, NEVADA, POP 
INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT 
A sleepy trucker called PIG PEN drives the third truck. 
SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.) I will be self-assured and confident around women. 
PIG PEN I will be self-assured and confident around women. 
EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT 
The rabbit stops at the edge of the road. The first truck speeds past. Then the second. The rabbit crosses the highway in front of the third. 
INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT 
SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.) I will not fear the unexpected. 
PIG PEN I will not fear the unexpected. 
The rabbit appears in the road, frozen by headlights. 
PIG PEN Ahhhhhhhhhh! 
Pig Pen jams on his brakes and swerves to avoid the bunny. 
EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT 
The truck slews crazily.    Missing the bunny by a whisker. 
INT. THIRD TRUCK (BRIDGE, DESERT) - NIGHT 
Pig Pen sees a bridge ahead. If he doesn't regain control, he will crash. At the last second, he gets the rig together. 
EXT. BRIDGE (DESERT) - THIRD TRUCK - NIGHT 
The rim of a wheel tags the curb. One of those toxic waste barrels falls out of the back and plunges to the water below. 
EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - NIGHT 
A biohazard warning label is legible as the barrel slips beneath the surface. Glowing toxic waste seeps from a gash in its side. Spreading through the pool like neon ink. 
EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - DAY 
The ditch is littered with garbage. The DRONE of INSECTS. No visible traces of toxic waste. A butterfly net sweeps through the air to capture an oversized horsefly. 
JOSHUA TAFT (70s), scrutinizes the bug. This old codger is more comfortable studying bugs than socializing with people. 
JOSHUA Hey, Mike.   Check this one out. 
MIKE PALMER (12) steps over for a look.     Puberty hit hard and fast for this bright, little nerd. 
MIKE He's huge! 
JOSHUA They've been like this all week. Must be something extra tasty in the water. 
MIKE Like what? 
JOSHUA Dead coyote. Snake maybe. Back in the 'Nam we'd eat python with a dash of habanero sauce. Mighty satisfying. 
JOSHUA She fills her prey with digestive acid to liquify the internal organs. Now watch... She'll drink her victim from the inside out. While it's still alive! 
MIKE (looks queasy) And you wonder why my mom doesn't like me hanging out with you. 
JOSHUA Arachnids have been roaming the earth for millions of years. And they'll be here long after the human race is dead and buried. 
Suddenly Consuela lunges at the glass.     Mike recoils. 
MIKE Bad!   Bad Consuela! 
Consuela backs up, apparently she can be intimidated. 
TARANTULA POV - MIKE 
The multi-eyed spider's PANORAMIC VISION. Mike looms large at the edge of the glass, wagging his finger. 
BACK TO MIKE 
Mike stares into the many eyes of Consuela. 
MIKE Do that again and I feed you to the parrot. 
CHARLIE SQUAWKS hungrily.    The sound of a CAR HORN. 
JOSHUA There's your mom. 
MIKE See you tomorrow, Joshua! 
Mike heads for the door. 
EXT. DESERT - DAY 
The entrance to a mine shaft protrudes from a hillside. A pickup truck is parked nearby. The faded logo on the door reads: McCORMICK AND SON MINING COMPANY, PROSPERITY, NV. 
INT. MINE SHAFT - DAY 
Rotten beams. Chipped walls. A GENERATOR POWERS a string of lightbulbs. A lone figure works at the end of the tunnel. 
CHRIS McCORMICK (30s) has rugged good looks. Weathered clothing. Dirt-stained face. Ripped muscles. 
Chris chips at the wall with his pickaxe. As it makes contact, the occasional spark flies up. Chris pauses to scrutinize the target area with his helmet-light. 
Something sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him. 
Chris is oblivious to his unseen stalker. He chips away a section of stone to reveal shiny minerals. Reflections of silver and gold splash across his face. His smile fades... 
CHRIS Damn. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Chris bends over, reaching for a bottle of water. A large rat scurries out of hiding dragging away Chris's sack lunch. 
Chris grabs his pick-axe and goes after the rat. The rodent dodges every hit. Sparks fly when the axe strikes rock. These ignite a vent of methane gas. 
A BRIEF EXPLOSION knocks Chris off his feet. He notices a small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on a stove. Chris pats out the flame as the rat scurries away with lunch. 
CHRIS Hope you like bologna! 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
A police car drives with a bicycle hanging out of the trunk. 
INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY 
SAMANTHA "SAM" PALMER (30s) is the sheriff of Prosperity and a confident, single mother. Mike is seated beside her. 
MIKE You   should see them, Mom. Each one   has a unique feeding behavior. The   spitters fire poisonous snot. The   tarantulas mummify their prey. The   jumpers can... 
SAM Why does he have all those things? 
MIKE He studies them. NASA uses spider webs in outer space. And for medicine. They've been here forever, and they'll be here long after we're all dead. 
SAM You're givin' me nightmares. 
MIKE Nightmares are cool. 
(CONTINUED) 
ASHLEY Can't you give 'em a break? 
SAM Get in the car, Ashley.       Now. 
ASHLEY But, Mom! 
Sam shoots his daughter an intimidating glance. 
BRET No sweat, babydoll.       We'll hook up later. 
SAM (threatening) Over my dead body. 
INT. SAM'S COP CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY 
Mike grins from the front seat as Ashley climbs in back. 
MIKE You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used... 
ASHLEY Shut up, dork. 
EXT. SHOULDER OF HIGHWAY - DAY 
Sam hands Bret the ticket. 
BRET Larry, do we know anybody at City Hall who can mark this go away? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LARRY Your Dad is the Mayor. 
BRET Oh, yeah. (to Sam) He signs your paycheck. 
SAM The next time you put my daughter's life in danger, I'll show you exactly how little that means to me. 
Bret and Larry feel her resolve. 
BRET Relax, bee-otch. It's all good. 
The punks remount their bikes. 
SAM I want both wheels on the ground. 
The punks REV their BIKES and defiantly wheelie toward town. 
INT. POLICE CAR - DAY 
Sam climbs behind the wheel. 
MIKE I read her her rights. 
SAM I can always count on you, Mike. 
Sam STARTS the CAR and drives toward town. 
ASHLEY Do you get off on humiliating me? 
SAM This bad girl act doesn't suit you, Ash. 
ASHLEY I'm just trying to have fun. Don't you remember what it's like to grow up here? 
SAM That's what scares me. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Sam reaches over and opens the glove box. She pulls out a stun gun. Mike passes it through the bars to Ashley. 
SAM I told you to keep this with you. 
Ashley slides the zapper into her backpack. 
ASHLEY You are so over protective. 
Mike and Ashley lip-sync along with Sam's response. 
SAM A mother's job is to protect her children. 
INT. DINER (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY 
An attractive waitress on roller-skates. A harried CHEF. Locals chow down. The RADIO BLARES in the b.g. 
WADE (V.O.) It puts food on the table. Haven't the people of this town lived hand-to-mouth for long enough? 
INT. BARBERSHOP (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY 
FLOYD and LEROY are the Jurassic era barbers. Floyd cuts Leroy's hair. The two men listen to the RADIO. 
WADE (V.O.) We're all gonna die in this hell hole. 
FLOYD Yeah, of boredom. 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
DEPUTY PETE sits with his feet up on the desk reading Playstation magazine. He listens to the RADIO. 
WADE (V.O.) Wouldn't it be nice not to worry about surviving retirement? Or taking a shot at that life-long dream? 
INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY 
WADE Think about it, Harlan, you could buy a commercial transmitter and start broadcasting to a national audience. 
HARLAN It would be nice to get the message out. Let people know the aliens walk among us. 
INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY 
Chris slows to a stop in front of the McCormick and Son Mining Company. This stately edifice was once the driving force behind the local economy. 
WADE (V.O.) If Chris McCormick refuses to sell his mines. The rest of us are out of luck. 
Chris frowns. 
INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY 
WADE (V.O.) I don't think it's fair for one person to wield that much power. But he's just like his father. Selfish. Greedy. And more than a little bit nuts. 
SAM Uh-oh. 
Sam flips on the SIREN and accelerates. 
INT. DINER - DAY 
The locals stop eating and look toward the radio. 
WADE (V.O.) That family has been digging in those tunnels since the twenties. If there was something down there, don't you think they would have found it by now? 
INT. BARBERSHOP - DAY 
Floyd and Leroy stare at the radio. 
WADE (V.O.) Common sense does not apply to crazy people. 
INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY 
WADE (V.O.) Might as well be chasing a leprechaun's pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Chris is furious as he PEELS OUT and speeds toward Harlan's. 
INT. DINER - DAY 
The locals watch Chris's pickup speed by. 
WADE (V.O.) ... lunatics... 
INT. BARBERSHOP - DAY 
Floyd and Leroy watch Chris speed by. 
WADE (V.O.) ... certifiably nuts... 
INT. POLICE CAR - (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY 
As Sam pulls into town. She sees Chris skid to a stop in front of Harlan's trailer. He leaps out of his pickup. 
ASHLEY (O.S.) Ladies first. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MIKE What's your excuse!? 
Sam sticks her head out of a room at the end of the hall. 
SAM You still want a ride, Mike? 
MIKE I'm just going to the mall. 
SAM Have fun. 
Mike heads down the hallway and out of the house. 
INT. PALMER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY 
Ashley turns on the shower, drops her robe, and climbs in. 
INT. BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY 
Ashley is surrounded by steam. She sings an edgy gangsta rap tune by NWA. Tres' bizarre, non? Shampoo lather cascades down her face. Her eyes close. She is oblivious to a small spider crossing a web in front of her. The spider gets clear as Ashley rinses off the soap. 
Ashley rubs conditioner into her hair. The lather builds. Covering her face. Forcing her eyes closed once more. The spider returns across its web right in front of her eyes. 
The water stops. Ashley reaches for the showerhead blindly knocking the spider off its web. She feels no water coming out, and fumbles for a washcloth. Reaching with eyes closed, she can't see the little spider has landed on top of the cloth. As Ashley retrieves it, the spider scurries onto its opposite side. 
Ashley wipes the soap off her face. The spider rides the washcloth and moves toward her hand. Before it can strike, Ashley gets her eyes clear and drops the cloth. 
The cloth lands on the floor atop the spider. As the beast stares out from under it, barefoot Ashley steps on the cloth. Crushing the spider without ever knowing it was there. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Ashley turns her attention to the showerhead. She cranks the water handles, trying to get the water flowing again. The handles suddenly pop off. Dozens of tiny spiders pour from the holes onto the floor. Ashley shrieks in horror. 
Sam bursts into the bathroom and yanks open the shower door. She drags Ashley out and looks at all the little spiders. 
SAM Now what? 
Ashley just screams. 
INT. HANK AND EMMA'S HOME - DAY 
The SCREAM of a SAWZALL. A house in the midst of remodeling. Sections of wall are exposed. Sheets cover furniture. HANK (30s) is the Bob Villa-poseur. 
A cat sits near an open section of wall. Watching something intently. The cat charges into the wall after unseen prey. 
EMMA (30s) comes downstairs wearing her bathrobe. She clutches her ears in pain, screaming for Hank to stop. He can't hear. She grabs his shoulder and he STOPS CUTTING. 
EMMA Why do you need to do that as six in the morning!? Do you hate me that much!? 
HANK I want to finish before I go to work. 
EMMA You've been saying that for six months! 
HANK I can't finish if you keep interrupting! 
Hanks RESTARTS the SAW as Emma staggers into the kitchen. 
INT. REMODELED HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
Emma makes herself a hangover helper. Egg, tabasco, lemon juice, and a shot of vodka. All of it goes into the BLENDER. She FIRES it UP. Competing with the noise of Hank's SAW. Then Emma notices a bowl of uneaten cat food. 
INT. REMODELED HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Emma comes back in and UNPLUGS the noisy SAW. 
HANK If you're gonna keep pulling the plug... 
EMMA Have you seen Zeke this morning? 
HANK He was chasing something earlier. 
EMMA If he got into the wall again, it's your balls in the blender. 
The Clerk grabs the PA's microphone. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CLERK (over PA speakers) All bug spray, rodent traps, ant poison and fly paper is on aisle five! 
He returns his attention to Mike. 
CLERK That'll be three fifty-two. 
Mike pays the man. 
MIKE Where's aisle five? 
The annoyed Clerk points. Mike heads over. He sees the aisle is crowded with locals squabbling over the few remaining cans of Raid, Black Flag and Off. 
EXT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE (TOWN) - DAY 
Beverly uncoils a hose, cranks a spigot. She sprays her vegetable garden with water. After a beat, a solid object is coughed up through the hose. 
Beverly continues watering. Two more unidentified objects are spewed from the hose. She reacts by cranking the spigot on full. The water sprays harder. Then inexplicably stops. 
Beverly checks the spigot. She looks into the opening of the hose. Puts it to her ear and listens. Sniffs. Now she puts the end of the hose in her mouth and sucks deeply, trying to siphon away the blockage. 
Beverly removes the hose. A FAINT RUMBLING sound. She puts it back in her mouth and sucks. A solid object comes through the hose and into her mouth. Then another. And another. A dozen things pump through the hose and into her mouth. 
Beverly yanks it out. Water spews from her mouth and out of the hose. Apparently the blockage has cleared. 
Beverly falls to her knees. Hunching forward. She vomits forth a stomach full of water... and small spiders. Mouth agape. Eyes wide in horror. She watches them scurry into the garden. Beverly tries to scream... but can only retch. 
EXT. STREET (TOWN) - DAY 
Mike Palmer rides his bike through a puddle of water. He sees Beverly throwing up in her vegetable garden. Mike it thoroughly grossed out. 
EXT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE (DESERT) - DAY 
Mike rides his bike into Joshua's front yard.    He dismounts before the BIKE stops. It CRASHES.     Mike heads inside. 
INT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY 
Mike stops short in the doorway. An off-hook TELEPHONE BEEPS incessantly. WIND MOANS through shattered windows. Furniture is tipped over. Mike moves through the chaos. 
MIKE Hello?   Joshua? Charlie? 
The spider tanks are shattered. No trace of their occupants. Mike pulls out his Cassiopeia PDA and starts recording. 
MIKE (into PDA) Captain's log. Stardate... 
Stops recording, PLAYS it BACK, listens to HIS VOICE. 
MIKE Cool! (records again) The house is deserted. No sign of Joshua Taft or his bird. The spider tanks are shattered. There is broken glass everywhere. 
Mike moves toward the back door of the cabin.    It swings open and shut in the WIND. 
EXT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE (DESERT) - BACK YARD - DAY 
Mike comes out and notices hundreds of coin-sized footprints. He follows these tracks to a cluster of wooden barricades labeled: "McCORMICK AND SONS MINING COMPANY." Mike peers toward a vertical mine shaft behind the barriers. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MIKE (into PDA) Animal tracks. Definitely too big to be spiders. Could be rats. 
Mike slips past the barricades. Following the tracks to the edge of the abyss. He can't see anything. It's too dark. 
Mike turns away and returns to the yard.    Never realizing... 
Several feet down the shaft. Hidden under a rock... the shriveled and desiccated corpse of Joshua Taft. It hangs from the side of the shaft in thick sticky webbing. Grisly. 
Suddenly the corpse is tugged loose and dragged deeper into the shaft by some unseen creature. 
EXT. MINE SHAFT - DAY 
Chris's pickup is parked outside another mine shaft. 
INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAY 
WADE Came out to feed my birds this morning. 
SAM Coyotes? 
WADE Hell no! 
The trio steps to the fence.    Only three mangy ostriches are there to greet them. 
WADE My flock had fifty birds! Where'd they go, dammit! Who the hell steals fifty birds that can't even fly!? 
SAM All this happened last night? 
WADE I guess.   And we didn't hear a thing. 
Sam gestures toward the BARKING DOG. 
SAM What about him? 
WADE Not a peep. 
Mike notices some ostrich feathers on the ground.     He heads over for a closer look. 
The DOG watches his progress.    BARKING excitedly. 
Sam talks to Wade. 
SAM How's the ostrich business? 
WADE Not so good lately. 
SAM You've got that new Hummer. You must be makin' enough to pay for it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WADE (annoyed) You like it? I'll take you for a ride. 
SAM These birds are insured.   Right? 
WADE I didn't kill my birds, Sam.      Is that what you think? 
Mike looks back to see his mom confronting Wade. 
WADE (in the distance) ... reject... absolutely not... 
Mike scrutinizes what appear to be more of those tracks that he found at Joshua's. But this time they are larger: 
MIKE (into PDA) I've found more tracks.    Even larger now. 
Mike follows the trail toward another mine entrance. This one is plugged with concrete. The tracks don't go there. They stop at what appears to be a normal patch of ground. Several ostrich feathers are scattered nearby. 
Mike takes a closer    look. Something doesn't seem right. An odd demarcation    in the soil. His fingers trace the edge of a thin film    of material. It is a lid of sorts. A sheath of sticky    webbing coated with dirt. Mike is able to lift it. 
Mike peers into a deep dark burrow three feet wide. 
INT. UNDERGROUND BURROW - DAY 
Twenty feet down the shaft.     A shape moves. 
TRAPDOOR SPIDER POV - MIKE 
A MULTI-EYED SPIDER'S VIEW of Mike at the top of the burrow. 
EXT. WADE'S RANCH - OSTRICH PEN - DAY 
Mike squints into the burrow but can't see anything. 
INT. UNDERGROUND BURROW - DAY 
A dark shape inches up the burrow toward Mike. 
EXT. WADE'S RANCH - OSTRICH PEN - DAY 
Mike is oblivious as he peers into the dark. 
EXT. WADE'S RANCH - RANCH HOUSE - DAY 
The BARKING CATTLE DOG SNAPS its TETHER and charges Mike. Sam and Wade see this and run after it. 
Bret smokes a Phillies Blunt as he donuts his TRUCK. Ashley laughs hysterically. Bret steers them around to the back of the truck stop. He SKIDS to a stop. 
ASHLEY Woo-hoo! 
Bret offers his stogie.    Ashley refuses.     Bret puffs away. 
ASHLEY Haven't you had enough of that? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BRET No such thing.     Norman's bud is da'kine. 
He coughs and they both laugh. 
BRET When I medal at the X-Games, Honda will give me full sponsorship. Then I'll take you with me on the Supercross tour. 
Ashley is silent. 
BRET Are you still thinking about going away? 
ASHLEY I don't know. I want to do something with my life, Bret. Help people. Maybe med school is still an option. 
BRET Not if you keep hanging out with me. 
ASHLEY Thanks, Mom. 
They kiss. Things head toward a serious        level of "get down." Bret slides his hand up Ashley's        shirt. Ashley gets into it. But then Bret slides his        hand toward the buttons of her 501s. Ashley removes his        hand. 
ASHLEY Slow down... 
Bret persists.       Ashley climbs off of him. 
BRET I thought you loved me. 
ASHLEY I do! 
BRET Then what's the problem? You want to leave town. You don't want to make out. 
ASHLEY I don't feel... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BRET What? 
ASHLEY I don't want to lose my virginity in the front seat of a monster truck. 
BRET Why didn't you say so? We can go outside. I've got a blanket in the back. 
ASHLEY No... I guess... I'm just not ready. 
BRET Tammy and Larry do it every night! 
ASHLEY Then call them! Have a menage a trois! 
BRET Come on,   Ashley. Mommy's not around.    You don't have to play the good   girl. Let Daddy give you what you   really want. 
Bret goes after her once more.      Ashley's not into it. 
ASHLEY Please, Bret... Please don't... 
But Bret won't listen. Ashley isn't strong enough to fight him. She reaches into her purse and pulls out her stun gun. She rams it up in Bret's crotch and pulls the trigger. 
Bret howls like a baboon in a wood chipper. He spasmodically jerks off of Ashley and tumbles out the driver's side door. 
EXT. BEHIND TRUCK STOP - DAY 
Bret twitches on the ground. 
BRET My balls? Ahh! My balls! (looks down) I pissed myself?! Damn, bee-otch! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Ashley watches from the truck. 
SAM (taken aback) Are you asking me out on a date? 
CHRIS Only if you're going to say yes. 
Sam smiles slightly. 
INT. MUSEUM - KITCHEN - DAY 
The basement door is wide open. Gladys mixes food in a bowl. A cigarette with a massive ash hangs off her lip. 
A male tarantula moves across the ceiling. The creature is the size of a pit bull. Two quivering palps flank dart-sized fangs. Multiple eyes the size of quarters. Hair all over. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Gladys is oblivious to the ominous threat above her. As she works, the spider shadows her. Every time the spider is about to strike, she goes another direction to get spices, utensils, a pan. 
Gladys places her bowl on the stove. Suddenly the tarantula drops onto the stove right in front of her. Gladys shrieks. The tarantula lashes out at her. Gladys grabs a frying pan and smashes it across the face as she stumbles backward. The spider reels, striking the burner knobs, turning on the gas. 
Gladys registers the sound of ESCAPING GAS. She looks back toward the fuse box and makes a run for it. As she goes, the tarantula fires a webline at her. 
Gladys gets the fuse off the top of the fuse box, but the webline prevents her from slotting it home. 
Gladys strains with all    her might, finally slots the fuse. She turns toward     the kitchen just in time to see the broken burner spark    to life. The gas ignites. The tarantula is engulfed in    flame. 
Gladys is knocked down by the blast. She lies on her back when a second male tarantula nails her with a webline. Gladys screams as she's dragged across the floor toward the basement door. 
The fire grows more intense, spreading quickly. 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
CHRIS So that's a 'No.' 
SAM My kids are the world to me, Chris. When their dad left... it really took a toll. On all of us. I can't go through that again. I won't. 
CHRIS No... I understand... I don't know what I was thinking... (laughs) Gladys has some crazy ideas. I'm gonna kill her. 
Deputy Pete throws open the door. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PETE The museum's on fire! 
OFF Chris's look. 
EXT. BURNING MUSEUM - DAY 
The museum burns. The volunteer fire department attacks the conflagration. All the locals are there to help. 
Sam's COP CAR SKIDS to a stop. Chris leaps out. Stares at the fire for a beat. And then he charges toward the inferno. Sam tackles him from behind. Pinning him to the ground. 
CHRIS No!   Let me go! Gladys!   Let me go! 
The museum collapses.     Chris watches it burn to the ground. 
EXT. MUSEUM - DAY (LATER) 
The fire is out. The once-proud building is now a smoldering pile of rubble. Locals stand in small groups. 
Chris wanders through the ruins as    firemen mop up. He picks something out of the char.     The map of the mines. Almost completely burned. Soaked     with water. He stares at it for a heavy beat. All that     remains of his legacy. Sam steps up. 
SAM Maybe she got out. 
Sam puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. 
CHRIS (devastated) She was cooking. The stove was broken. 
SAM Why don't you come home with me? We'll get you cleaned up. 
Chris hesitates for a moment. And then he lets the map fall. He walks out of the ruins with Sam. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Mike stands off to the side. He spots something near the edge of the ruins. He goes over to pick it up. It's a piece of arachnid exoskeleton. A spider's leg. Big. Very big. Travis the fire chief warns him away. 
Chris looks up at Sam. 
CHRIS They keep their food alive. 
Mike hands his mother the new piece of exoskeleton. 
SAM What is this? 
MIKE A spider's leg! 
Sam flinches, dropping the object to the floor. 
MIKE Careful! 
SAM No. That's a piece of cactus. Look... It's covered with spines. 
MIKE Those are quills! Tarantulas can flick them at you like darts! 
Mike does an odd flicking motion.       Kind of like a dog scratching a flea. 
SAM Giant tarantulas? 
MIKE Tarantulas! Wolfs! Trapdoors! Joshua had a ton of exotics! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CHRIS If there were giant spiders roaming the desert, don't you think somebody would've seen them by now? 
MIKE The jumpers hunt in daylight. But not the others. They only come out when the sun goes down! 
The group looks to the window, the sun hangs low in the sky. 
EXT. TOWN - DUSK 
Prosperity is bathed in sunset. The mine shaft entrances are clearly visible. Like black holes of malevolent promise. 
INT. PALMER HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY 
The garage is cluttered. Old station wagon. Bikes. Skis. Sam leads Chris to a bag full of her ex-husband's clothes. 
SAM I guess I should watch more 'Oprah.' It must be a textbook 'no-dad' kind of thing. 
Chris shifts awkwardly.     In shock.   Sad.   Sam holds up a flannel shirt. 
CHRIS That one looks kind of scratchy. 
Sam holds up a shirt that Chris approves of. He takes it and proceeds to take off his old soot-stained shirt. 
SAM All Jason cared about was getting out and starting over. I guess that included buying a new wardrobe. 
Sam turns to pass Chris a pair of Levis. He's buttoning up the new shirt. Chris takes the pants. He doesn't register Sam ogling his exposed chest. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CHRIS Gladys thought I should sell... but you know... I never wanted to get rich. If it was about the money, I would have sold out to Wade a long time ago. 
Chris moves behind the car and takes off his pants. 
CHRIS I think I just wanted to prove the gold was down there. That my family wasn't crazy to keep looking. Even after we'd lost so much. And now... she's gone, too. 
SAM I'm sorry, Chris. 
CHRIS Do you know what I'm trying to say? 
SAM It wasn't about spending the gold, it was about finding it. 
CHRIS That's right.    That's exactly right. 
Sam glimpses Chris through car windows. The poor guy's struggling to pull on some 501s. Sam turns away, but catches sight of him in a propped-up glass door. 
CHRIS Remind me never to let you do my laundry. 
She turns, only to see him in a mirror. He steps out from behind the car. Sam stares at him. 
SAM They look great. 
Chris puts himself between Ashley and the spider. He looks for a weapon. Lunges for the scissors, but the spitter nails him with a blast of glue. Chris is flung across the room and stuck to the wall by the sleeve of his shirt. He shrugs out of it and makes another grab for his scissors. He gets them. 
MIKE Get under it! Stab it in the abdomen! They don't have any armor down there! 
CHRIS How am I supposed to do that!? 
The spider leaps at Chris... and EXPLODES in midair. Bits of gore shower Chris. He stands to see Sam in the door with her shotgun. Chris is covered in spider guts. 
CHRIS I'm gonna need some new pants. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Sam finishes loading new shells into her shotgun and then pops a fresh clip into her 9mm. Chris comes out of the garage wearing clean clothes. Sam chucks him the pistol. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SAM Ever used one of these? 
CHRIS I'm a fast learner. 
Chris tries to put the gun in his pocket. And then his waistband. But these damn pants are too tight. 
Ashley uses scissors to cut web out of her hair. 
MIKE I told you! I told you all!     But nobody ever listens to Mike! Still think I'm crazy, Mom? 
SAM I'm sorry I didn't believe you. 
Ashley is about to hyperventilate. 
SAM Calm down, baby. 
ASHLEY There aren't enough wine coolers in the world to calm me down! 
SAM I won't let anything happen to you. 
Sam ka-chacks a fresh round into her shotgun. 
CHRIS What other spiders did Joshua have? 
MIKE Spitters, jumpers, orb weavers, tarantulas... 
CHRIS Why couldn't he keep goldfish like a normal person? 
Sam checks the phone.     It's dead. 
SAM We need to warn people. 
CHRIS How about the radio station? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SAM Good one.    We'll go to Harlan's. 
ASHLEY Outside?    You want to go outside? 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - PALMER HOUSE- NIGHT 
Chris and Sam open the front door of the house.          Sam looks one way. Chris the other. 
No giant spiders lurking about. Chris and Sam continue onto the lawn. Mike and Ashley watch from the safety of the doorway. They listen to the comforting SOUNDS OF a SUMMER NIGHT. 
SAM It's okay... 
Mike and Ashley move out of the doorway.          Joining the adults. They move toward the cop car. 
EXT. STREETS (TOWN) - NIGHT 
The cop car cruises. The occupants peer out the windows. Everything appears normal. Although no people are visible. 
EXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - NIGHT 
Sam, Chris, and the kids move away from the cop car to the door. They are at the far end of town. All appears to be normal. 
INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - NIGHT 
MIKE Wait, Mom! The noise will attract more of them! 
CHRIS Let's try for the mall. 
Sam leads the others toward town. 
EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
Chris and Sam hang onto the panicked kids. Harlan brings up the rear. The place is chaos. People are chased by spiders. Dragged by spiders. Killed by spiders. Eaten by spiders. 
CHRIS My truck's at the museum. 
SAM Your keys? 
CHRIS In my other pants. 
MIKE Look out! 
The group flees a trio of goo-firing spitters.    Suddenly a familiar mini-van races past. 
HARLAN Stop!    Take us with you! 
Harlan tries to flag down the speeding ride but sees... 
The van's occupants are locked in combat with a jumper. The beast is inside their vehicle and tearing them to pieces. The van crashes. 
EXT. POWER LINES (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - NIGHT 
A group of orb weavers scurry across power lines. They hit a transformer, shorting it out. The entire town is suddenly plunged into darkness. Headlights. GUNFIRE. Moonlight. Spotty illumination for the arachnids' feeding frenzy. 
EXT. ALLEY (TOWN) - NIGHT 
A dumpster. The lid rises slightly. Wade Hale peers out from within. He lifts the lid higher, oblivious to the wolf spider on top of it. The spider reaches down at him. 
WADE No!     Please! 
The spider is suddenly BLOWN AWAY by Sam and Chris.      Wade climbs out of the dumpster. 
WADE Thank you! 
Chris and Sam move on with the kids. Wade runs after them. Mike looks at garbage-covered Wade. 
MIKE You stink. 
WADE (to Ashley) Have you seen Bret? 
ASHLEY He was out at the dunes. 
SAM Go ahead.    I've got your butt. 
CHRIS What? 
SAM Your back!    I've got your back! 
Chris gives Sam a funny look.       Maybe Gladys was right... 
EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
Sam leads her group down toward the mall. Other groups of survivors do likewise. As they get closer to the mall the groups coalesce into one large pack. We recognize Deputy Pete. Fireman Travis. The roller-skating waitress. Floyd. Leroy. Hank. Emma. And many other locals. 
EXT. DESERT (NEAR MALL) - NIGHT 
Sam and Chris are at the front of the mob with their kids. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Suddenly a trapdoor spider pops out of the ground. It grabs Travis the fire chief, and pulls him under, quickly replacing the roof of its den. TRAVIS SCREAMS underground. 
MIKE Trapdoors!    They're all around us! 
SAM How can we spot them? 
Mike consults his Cassiopeia. 
MIKE I didn't download that part! 
ASHLEY You dork! 
CHRIS We're sealed up at both ends. 
Sam hands Chris a shotgun.    He tries to get the feel of it. 
SAM You pump the slide to jack in a fresh round. Point at your target and squeeze. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Chris tries it out, pumping the slide. A shell flies out the slide of the weapon and hits Wade in the head. 
WADE Watch it! 
CHRIS Like that? 
Sam shakes her head and takes the gun back.       She pulls a machete off the wall and hands it to Chris. 
SAM Try not to cut yourself. 
INT. MALL - NIGHT 
The place has the feeling of a fortress under a siege. Separate groups of townspeople are stationed at the entrances to watch the spiders' every move. 
INT. MALL - NORTH ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
WADE Why didn't we see them earlier? 
MIKE For the last time! They can't handle the sunlight. They were waiting in the mines for the sun to go down! 
CHRIS Then at daybreak they'll go back inside. We can walk out the front door. 
MIKE We won't make it that long. 
ASHLEY They're gonna come in after us? 
MIKE They're growing very fast. They need food to sustain that kind of development. 
HANK Someone should go out and get help. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
EMMA You go, Sam. 
SAM Me? 
WADE You're the sheriff. 
SAM I don't have that many handcuffs. 
PETE What about the police radio? 
SAM You're not goin' back out there, Pete. None of us are. 
CHRIS Radio Shack is full of cell phones. 
WADE But the signal won't get out of the valley. That's why we couldn't sell any of the damn things. 
HARLAN My antenna... 
The group looks up. The moon-cast shadow of the antenna is visible on the skylights that run the length of the mall. 
HARLAN I could climb up to the top. I bet I could get a signal out. 
WADE Great idea.    You should do that. 
CHRIS I'll cover you, Harlan. 
INT. MALL - NIGHT 
Wade leads Chris and Harlan toward an access door. Sam stands with her kids. Watching. Chris looks over his shoulder for one last look. Sam runs up to him, gives him the shotgun. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SAM Are you sure you can handle this? 
EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT 
Harlan checks the phone. 
HARLAN I've got a signal! 
He dials 911. 
EXT. MALL - ROOF - NIGHT 
Chris is surrounded by spiders.        He starts climbing up the antenna. 
CHRIS They're coming! 
EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT 
Harlan is on the phone.       He hears... 
OPERATOR (V.O.) 911 Emergency. 
HARLAN I'm calling from Prosperity Nevada! We're being attacked by giant spiders! The entire town has been overrun! 
Chris yells up to him. 
CHRIS No!   Don't say that! 
OPERATOR (V.O.) This is Emergency Services. Not dial-a-joke. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CLICK. The LINE GOES DEAD. Chris climbs up beside him. He FIRES several BLASTS at the approaching spiders. 
CHRIS What happened? 
HARLAN They didn't believe me! 
CHRIS What a shock!     Try again! 
The spiders are closing in as Harlan re-dials. 
OPERATOR (V.O.) 911 Emergency. 
HARLAN There was a massive explosion! Everybody's dead! 
OPERATOR (V.O.) Sir, your number has been flagged as a source of a crank call. I'm afraid I must terminate this conversation. 
CLICK. 
HARLAN She hung up on me! 
CHRIS Climb! 
Chris FIRES the SHOTGUN.       The spiders are closing in. 
INT. MALL - NIGHT 
Sam gazes up at the skylight. She can see the silhouette of Chris and Harlan climbing the antenna. Pursued by spiders. 
SAM (sotto) Oh my God... 
Ashley screams in horror nearby. 
ASHLEY They're inside! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Sam whirls to see Ashley pointing at several spiders coming out of Victoria's Secret. Sam runs over to fight them. 
WADE Over here! 
He faces off against more spiders coming through the Home and Garden store. 
EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT 
Harlan is at the top. Chris is a bit lower. The spiders are still coming. Chris SHOOTS at them. His GUN RUNS DRY. He flips it around and butt-strokes an approaching arac. 
They see a way out, head for that exit, only to find a spider coming through it. Mike tosses one of his perfume grenades at the spider, covering their retreat. 
Another spider comes after them through one of the tubes. Mike chucks another perfume bottle. The spider cowers. 
MIKE We've gotta go! 
Ashley finds a hole that leads to the slide. 
ASHLEY Here! 
She starts down with Mike close behind. A large spider looms at the end. Ashley tries to arrest her slide. But it's no use. At the last second Sam's boot kicks the arachnid clear. 
INT. MALL - NIGHT 
Ashley and Mike pour out of the slide. Chris and Sam finish off the spider and then run with the kids. 
Emma runs parallel to them across the playground's sandbox. Only to be yanked under by a trapdoor spider. 
Hank sees this and goes after the spiders with all his tools. Getting revenge with a nail gun in each hand. 
HANK It's tool time! 
Floyd is still going crazy, slicing spiders with his chain-saw, he lets out a victorious yell until a hungry spider descends on him from above and knocks him to the floor. 
Chris passes a clothing store displaying Levi 501s.    He stops for a moment to look at the jeans. 
SAM (O.S.) Chris! 
Chris continues on. 
All of the survivors meet in the middle of the mall and prepare for Custer's last stand. Spiders charge from all directions. 
Mike throws his perfume grenades. Sam and Chris SHOOT. Others use their make-shift weapons. 
Norman pulls out a joint and sparks it.    Mike sees this and gets an idea. 
MIKE Where do you grow your weed?! 
NORMAN Dude, if I tell you, I have to kill you. 
Norman takes a hit on his reefer. 
MIKE They're going to kill us, you stoner! 
Norman sees the army of spiders closing in. 
NORMAN Over here! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Norman opens    an access door. Sam and the other survivors run over and    crowd through it. Norman shuts the door behind them.     The groups of pursuing spiders collide and begin ripping    each other to pieces in a feeding frenzy. 
INT. MALL - ACCESS STAIRS - NIGHT 
Norman leads the survivors down the tight hallway. 
WADE Where are you taking us? 
NORMAN To Shangri-la. 
INT. MALL - BASEMENT POT ROOM - NIGHT 
Norman leads the survivors into a basement room full of pot paraphernalia. Hookahs. Weed growing in hydroponic units under battery powered lights. Psychedelic posters. 
NORMAN You aren't going to arrest me for this are you? 
SAM Not today. 
The group can hear SPIDERS BASHING at the upstairs door. 
WADE (to Norman) Oh great! Now you've trapped us! 
Chris moves to the bottom of the stairs. 
CHRIS We should be able to hold them off for a little while. 
Suddenly a loud BANGING ERUPTS on the wall behind them. 
INT. MINES - JUNCTION - NIGHT 
A boarded-up shaft entrance. Suddenly the WOOD SPLINTERS. Chris and the others bash through. They file into a slightly more open area with two branching tunnels. The place is stacked from floor to ceiling with barrels of toxic waste. 
CHRIS I don't believe it... 
Mike recognizes the BioHazard warning label he saw on the barrel in the drainage ditch. 
MIKE I've seen one of these before! 
ASHLEY What are they? 
CHRIS Toxic waste. 
SAM Where did you see it, Mike? 
MIKE The creek where Joshua gets his spider food. There was one in the water. 
Chris starts toward the sloping tunnel. 
CHRIS We can get out this way! 
BRET No, we can't. (turns to Wade) Isn't that tunnel blocked off, Dad? 
Chris and the others look at Wade. 
WADE Uh... yeah... he's right.   We can't get out that way. 
CHRIS You did this? 
WADE I knew you'd never sell... We're under my property so... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SAM You put all of us at risk. 
WADE I didn't have a choice! I was broke! They gave me a hundred grand! 
Sam punches him.     Knocking Wade to the ground. 
SAM I think our lives are worth a little more than that. 
CHRIS We're wasting time. 
Chris heads toward the only exit available. The others follow. Wade staggers to his feet. Stumbling after them. 
INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT 
Chris leads the group down a tunnel. They come across bits of vintage mining gear. A string of old light bulbs runs along the roof into both tunnels. 
CHRIS One end of these lights should be connected to a generator. That'll be near the entrance. 
They continue down the tunnel.     Entering... 
INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT 
A large cavern. Animal carcasses litter the ground. Some human remains. Dead pets. Dead ostriches. 
WADE My birds! You see, Sam? I wasn't lying! That's what I can put on the insurance form... giant spiders! 
ASHLEY Ewww... what's that smell? 
The others are reacting strongly. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CHRIS Methane.   This cavern is full of gas. 
ASHLEY What does that mean? 
CHRIS One spark and we're all dead. 
Norman swallows his glowing joint. 
Chris shines his flashlight on a pile of mummy bundles. 
Sam rides back the way they came, heading straight toward the male tarantula. Ashley looks over her mother's shoulder at the giant spider coming in the opposite direction. 
ASHLEY Oh shit. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Sam lifts the bike into a wheelie as the tarantula nears. 
SAM Banzai! 
With perfect timing, she brings the front wheel down hard onto the tarantula's back. Crunch! The spider is roadkill. Sam steers them down another tunnel. 
EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAWN 
Mike and Gladys gather at a generator just shy of the tunnel exit. Mike tries to start the generator. It won't catch. 
MIKE It needs gas! 
GLADYS There's a ranch! 
Gladys heads over toward Wade's ranch. 
INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN 
Chris runs along the tunnel. Consuela charges after him, Chris reaches up, smashing more light bulbs as he runs. 
EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAWN 
Mike is at the generator as Sam and Ashley ride up on the motorcycle. 
MIKE It needs gas! 
Sam tips over the motorcycle, trying to get gas out of the tank. It's clear this is not going to work. 
ASHLEY Hurry! 
INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN 
Chris runs.     Smashing light bulbs.   Consuela close behind. 
CHRIS Start the generator! 
EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAWN 
MIKE He's coming! 
ASHLEY Hurry, Mom! 
Sam has dumped some fuel into the generator.   She tries to start it. It won't turn over. 
INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN 
Chris ducks as Consuela fires quills at him.   He keeps going. 
INT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - DAWN 
Sam sees Chris at the bottom of the tunnel. She tries to start the generator again but it refuses to cooperate. 
CHRIS Throw the switch! 
SAM I don't have any power! 
ASHLEY Yo, Mom! 
Sam turns as Ashley throws her the STUN GUN. Sam catches it and brings it down to the light bulb cable... ZAPPING it. 
INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN 
As Chris runs, the light bulbs illuminate sequentially, traveling past him into the cavern. 
INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN 
A broken light bulb sparks. The filament ignites the gas-filled tunnel. A ball of flame spreads throughout the mines. 
INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - DAWN 
A huge column of flame blasts into the chamber. All the gold is illuminated. Consuela's babies are burned like popcorn.

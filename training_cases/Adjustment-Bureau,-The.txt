David stands alone looking out at the empty room. Trying to get used to it. It's not easy. 
INT. MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
David enters the huge, ornate, men's room and goes to the row of sinks. He pulls two Ricola cherry lozenges from his pocket. He twirls them in his hands for a moment. Then tosses them into the trash can. He looks at himself in the mirror, fighting to hold himself together. A sound behind him. David spins to see a WOMAN exiting one of the stalls. She's in a stunning ball gown and carrying an expensive bottle of champagne. 
WOMAN Hi. I hope I didn't startle you. 
DAVID What are you doing in here? 
WOMAN Hiding from security. 
DAVID Oh... . What did you do? 
WOMAN Crashed a wedding. One floor up. 
DAVID It's almost midnight. They'just caught on now? 
WOMAN Ivana Trump finally realized I wasn't her niece. I think after the fifth; glass of champagne my Czech accent started slipping. spite of David's state that gets a grin. 
DAVID Are you for real? 
WOMAN Life is short. 
DAVID Hard to argue with that. 
WOMAN You're that guy running for Senate aren't you? 
DAVID I'm "that guy." 
WOMAN You winning? 
DAVID No. 
WOMAN Too bad. The other guy's a tool. 
DAVID 
(LAUGHS) Maybe I should have made that clearer in my ads. 
WOMAN Personally, I think mooning your friends at a college reunion is no big deal. 
(BEAT) And I don't think the Post should have printed the photo. David just shakes his head. He will never, ever live that down and he knows it. 
WOMAN At least not full page. He can't help but crack up. 
WOMAN Listen, I've done it. 
DAVID You weren't running, for Senate at the time. 
WOMAN Do you still have a chance or is it over? 
DAVID He crushed me. She has beautiful eyes. And an exceptional gift for conveying empathy... 
WOMAN You must ...I don't know what you must be feeling... 
DAVID Winning would feel better. But losing has its advantages. 
WOMAN Like what? 
DAVID The only time a politician is alone is when he's asleep.. .or in the bathroom. After eight years in politics that gets kind of hard to take. She tilts her head a little, gives him a curious look. 
WOMAN Watching you, you'd never know it. The way she looks at him, the way she says it, David knows she sees what others miss in him -- even if he isn't even quite sure what it is. Not yet. 
DAVID Thank you... 
WOMAN Well, everything happens for a reason, right? Even losing. God, I'm really rollrng out the platitudes tonight, aren't I? 
DAVID It's the champagne. Brines out the Hallmark in people. 
WOMAN After it kills their Czech accents. She offers:him the bottle. He hesitates, then takes it. 
DAVID Why not? I have to think up some good platitudes for my speech. He takes a gulp of champagne. 
WOMAN Why the hell would you do that? 
DAVID Apparently, even if I hadn't been caught dropping my drawers in the middle of a senate campaign I would have lost the election anyway because I'm too blunt. 
WOMAN (swig of champagne) Says who? 
DAVID The TV pundits. 
HARRY Two weeks. Richardson claps him din-the shoulder and leaves. Harry watches him go. 
INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING 
An alarm clock reads "5:44 airy." It turns to "5:45" and the alarm goes off. A hand reaches over and taps the alarm off. FOLLOW the arm back to David Norris in a king-sized bed. He rubs his eyes, stretches his neck, and climbs out of bed.

EXT. 23RD STREET -- MORNING 
The bus pulls out. Harry keeps running after it. 
HARRY No... 
INT. BUS -- MORNING 
As David walks down the aisle a couple of passengers recognize his face. . .but they don't say anything. David nears an empty aisle seat. A woman is curled up in the window seat, sleeping. She wears a funky mini-dress, knee- high argyle socks under leather boots, and a (clashing) argyle bucket cap. David sits next to her. And stares. 
DAVID No way... It's the woman from election night.', He leans around to try to see the front of her face. "It's definitely her. His eyes drift down at her legs. Just then she opens her eyes. She recoils for a second;. Then` her eyes soften when she realizes who it is. 
INT. BUS -- MORNING 
David's phone rings again. As he reaches for the phone he fumbles his coffee cup, the lid comes off, and a slosh of coffee crests the brim and splashes on the woman's dress. 
DAVID Oh, Jesus... 
(FIGHTING LAUGHTER) I'm sorry. 
EXT. BROADWAY AND 19TH -- MORNING 
Harry's face. 
HARRY Shit! He's looking at a leather portfolio. We catch a glimpse inside: a complicated circuit diagram. Harry shuts the book, look's up to get a bead on" the the bus, then takes off down Broadway, again, hoping to cut it off at Union Square. 
INT.'BUS -- MORNING 
DAVID I'll pay for the damage. He pulls out his wallet. There's $7 inside. She laughs. 
WOMAN Hope your new job pays better than your old one. 
DAVID Give me your number and I'll send you a check. 
WOMAN God, that is smooth. Spill coffee on me then ask for my number. She takes the coffee from his hands and casually takes a sip, then turns back to him with a devilish look in her eyes. 
WOMAN Just let me spill some on you and we'll be even. She thrusts the cup toward his tie. David parries. 
DAVID It's my first day at the office! 
WOMAN Tell your boss some crazy chick dumped coffee on you on the MI. It's New York; he'll understand. She thrusts the cup back at him- 
DAVID No! He grabs the cup with both his hands over hers. 
WOMAN 
(ACTUALLY PLEADING) Come on. Just a little. They struggle with the cup. <,;:Both suppressing laughter. 
DAVID You're crazy. Actually crazy. The phone on David's lap'RINGS again. She snatches it with her free hand. 
WOMAN 
(INTO PHONE) He's not here! She hangs up. 
DAVID Who was that? She shrugs. Sorry, pal. He lunges for his phone, but she holds it on the other side of her body. 
DAVID What is this, third grade? 
WOMAN You forgot what that was like, didn't you? How fun it was... That stops him for a moment. Until the phone RINGS again. 
WOMAN Oh my God! How do you stand it? She drops the phone into the coffee. 
WOMAN There. We're even. He stares at her. Incredulous. They lock eyes. God knows what would come next if they were in private... The fourth RING gurgles up through the coffee. A beat. 
WOMAN Sturdy little fucker, isn't it? She pulls the phone out of the cup and wipes it off with her scarf, pushing the button which sends the call to voice mail. Then she reaches out her hand, as if to shake. 
WOMAN By the way, I'm Elise. 
EXT. UNION SQUARE -- DAY 
Elise exits.. the bus. David stands at the bus door watching her. She turns back to look at him. 
DAVID The morning after .I lost I woke up thinking about you . That melts her. Instantly. All her bravado drops. 
INT. BUS -- MORNING 
Moments later. Through the window, David watches Elise walking down the sidewalk. Their eyes meet. She blows him a little kiss before she turns the corner. His heart skips a beat as the bus continues on down Union Square East. 
EXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING 
Harry runs through Union Square bee-lining for David's bus. 
INT. BUS -- MORNING 
David looks at Elise's number, scribbled on a piece of paper. He carefully tucks her number into his wallet. Then takes the most satisfying sip of coffee he's ever had in his life-- 
EXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING 
Spotting David through the bus window, Harry thrusts his Fedora back onto his head and points at the bus-- 
INT. BUS -- MORNING 
Just as David finishes his sip the-plastic lid pops off the cup. A second earlier and the coffee would have poured all over his shirt. Instead it spills: on the floor. 
DAVID Jesus! Three men in business suits talking by the window spin to see David. it's Mr. Richardson and-two aides we recognize as the "security guards" who chased Elise away on election night. 
DAVID (,.CONT'D) What the hell are you doing?! Richardson blinks Clearly surprised. Then: 
RICHARDSON Grab him! David bolts out of the office as they lunge at him-- 
INT. RSR OFFICE FLOOR -- MORNING 
David sprints toward the door he came in. It closes as he gets there. He grabs it. It's locked. He sprints away into an internal hallway. Richardson emerges from a door in the middle of the hallway. 
David jumps a mile. It's physically impossible that Richardson could have gotten there that fast. 
RICHARDSON You can't get away, David. David spins and rushes back into the main office, then down an internal staircase to the floor below. Jumps the last five steps and hits the floor hard. As he comes up he runs smack into another RSR employee who is frozen solid. David curses, then dives around the frozen employee to find Richardson, coming out of another office. down the hall. Again, physically impossible for him to get there that fast-- David spins and-- A DISTORTED WIDE ANGLE SHOT of a chloroform rag shoved right at us. FOCUS GOES IN AND OUT... FROM DAVID'S POV, BLURRY FOCUS as he's carried toward one of the large corner offices on the 40th floor. The nameplate reads "Steve Kincaid." Richardson opens the door and ushers his men, carrying David, 
INSIDE -- Except when they walk through the door they're not in an office 40 floors above lower Manhattan,: they step inside a large warehouse... Their movement completely violates the laws of physics. 
BLACK SCREEN Silence. Then voices come up slowly: 
RICHARDSON (O.S.) Yes, sir. No, sir. No, sir. I understand that, sir. Absolutely. I'll do that, sir. 
(BEAT) What a goddamm mess. 
MCCRADY (O.S.) Was that Donaldson? 
RICHARDSON (O.S.) Yes. 
MCCRADY (O.S.) What do you want to do? 
FADE UP -- BLURRY AT FIRST -- to DAVID'S POV of the warehouse David caught a glimpse of just before he passed out. A half-dozen members of the "Intervention Team" (the Silver Suits) stand nearby. Richardson and MCCRADY (one of the men from the rooftops) stand behind David, about 20 feet away. 
RICHARDSON (O.S.) Can you reset him? 
MCCRADY (O.S.) I don't think we have the authority in a situation like this. 
RICHARDSON (O.S.) 
CALL LEGAL- 
BURDENSKY (0.S.). Legal just arrived. 
INT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY 
REVEAL BURDENSKY, a 50 year-old in a pin-stripe suit, carrying a briefcase. He.walks to Richardson. 
BURDENSKY Re-setting's off the table. This is our fault:... Richardson glances irately at Harry, who stands by himself off to the side, clearly disgraced. David, who is tied to a chair facing away from Richardson, cranes around to see who's talking. 
DAVID Hey. The suits stare back in silence for a beat, then turn back to talking amongst themselves -- though at a lower volume. 
RICHARDSON What are my options? 
BURDENSKY 
(IGNORING DAVID) You could bullshit him but you'll never be completely successful. 
DAVID Can somebody tell me what's going on? 
BURDENSKY (still ignoring him) The questions will burn in him till the day he dies. You'll have to monitor him constantly... 
ON DAVID He can hear little snippets of what Burdensky's saying-- 
BURDENSKY (PARTIALLY AUDIBLE) .to make sure he doesn't talk... the endless ripple effects... REVEAL David untying the rope restraining him. 
ON THE SUITS 
BURDENSKY If it were me, I'd level with him. 
RIC:HARDSON Completely? 
BURDENSKY That's the only way to extinguish his curiosity. Richardson turns and studies David. Then walks over to him. An uncomfortable pause. 
DAVID Who are you guys? 
RICHARDSON We're the people v ho make sure things happen according to Plan. David stares back at him for a moment. then leaps up. His rope comes off and the chair falls. He sprints toward an open door forty feet across the warehouse. Richardson makes a little gesture with his hand-- 
CLOSE-UP OF THE FLOOR It cracks.. .and displaces upward.. .so it's uneven just as David's foot comes down on it. 
BACK TO WIDE SHOT David trips and goes flying-- 
MOMENTS LATER David is dragged back to the center of the room and placed back in his chair in front of Richardson. 
RICHARDSON Did you really think I couldn't see that coming? David dabs blood from his lip, which split during the fall. 
EXT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY 
David exits through a steel door., it clangs shut behind him. He stands there unable to proceed for a long beat then starts walking to the corner to orient himself. Down one street he spots the Manhattan Bridge, down the other the Brooklyn Bridge. He's in DUMBO. 
INT. BROOKLYN COCKTAIL LOUNGE -- AFTERNOON 
David sits alone at the bar. His hand trembles slightly. 
BARTENDER You're David Norris, right? 
DAVID Ice water. 
BARTENDER That's it? David nods. Harry arrives. 
HARRY We should talk. But not here. Go back to work and I'll contact you later today with a place to meet. 
DAVID Okay. Harry can see that David is still very shaken. 
HARRY The world's exactly the same as it's always been. You just understand it more completely now.

INT. 40TH FLOOR --:DAY 
David stands in ftontof the corner office labeled "Steve Kincaid." He hesitates, then opens it. He sees an empty office with a killer view of New-,York Harbor. It's strangely disorienting for him. 
SECRETARY(O.S.) Mr. IKincaid's in the finance meeting, Congressitan. Main conference room. David turns to see her. 
DAVID Thanks. David walks away, still trying to get his bearings in the new reality he now knows. Charlie comes around a corner. 
CHARLIE There you are. I called your cell ten times. You left me hanging. 
DAVID Sorry... 
CHARLIE (seeing the look in 
DAVID'S EYES) Are you okay? (off David's nod) Come on, we're late. Happy first day by the way. They head towards the conference room. 
CHARLIE You sure you're okay. 
DAVID Fine. How about you? 
CHARLIE Great. Why? 
DAVID No headaches or-- 
CHARLIE I feel fantastic, -man. Is it just, me or is this an odd conversation? (off David" s non-response.) What the hell happened with the girl?

THEY ENTER-- 
INT. DAVID'S OFFICE -- DAY

DAVID I lost her number. 
CHARLIE You lost her number? 
DAVID (searching for something) I was pickpocketed. 
CHARLIE Come on. You can't be serious. (off David's look) You're serious... Oh, man...dude. I'm sorry... I'm really sorry... 
EXT. PIER -- ADJACENT TO WEST SIDE HIGHWAY -- DAY 
Huge shafts of morning sunlight cut across the park outside David's apartment. The trees are blooming. It's Spring now. 
INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING 
An alarm clock reads 6:29 am. David lies alone in bed. He's already awake, staring at the ceiling... After a long beat the alarm clock rings. David shuts it off. But then just lies there... 
INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT -- MORNING 
It's the same apartment -- except it's bigger now. Instead of two large windows on the park, his apartment is now six windows across. (He has bought the two one-bedrooms next to his and knocked the walls down). Three years have passed. No files on the table, like there were the last time we were here. David is on the phone in a new park-view study. 
CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.) How are you feeling about the speech? David has not noticeably aged and yet he's more tempered and subdued than when we last saw him. We `hear it in his voice: 
DAVID I'm ready... I changed a few things last night. 
CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.) Tell me at breakfast. 
THROUGH THE WINDOW AT DAVID David finishes his call, then looks out the window. There is a detachment in h-s eyes that didn't exist before. After a moment, he gets his=coat and heads for the door. 
EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING 
David exits Starbucks with a coffee. He walks across the park toward the same Fifth Avenue bus stop he did three years ado.` Even his posture and,-gait are different. 
INT. BUS -- MORNING 
David enters the Ml bus. He feeds his Metrocard into the reader as he looks down the aisle scanning the riders.. .more out of habit than actual hope. He walks back to take a seat. 
INT. BUS -- MINUTES LATER -- MORNING 
David stares idly out the window. His Blackberry buzzes with a text message. Looks down at it. Then looks back out the window. Suddenly his eyes snap into focus. DAVID'S POV: The bus passes a woman walking on the sidewalk. 
David's head whips around, only able to see her from the back now. She walks like Elise. She's dressed in the same eclectic style. He slams the red "next stop" strip, jumps to his feet, and runs to the front of the bus. 
DAVID Stop the bus. 
DRIVER The next stop-- 
DAVID Now. 
EXT. EAST VILLAGE -- MORNING 
The bus stops. David jumps out on Broadway. FOLLOW him as he takes off across the street and runs down 12th. He catches up to her at University Place. 
DAVID Elise! The woman turns around. And it's her... 
ELISE David? 
DAVID Hi. 
ELISE Wow... How areyou. Reeling from the adrenaline; David takes a moment, then: 
DAVID (from the heart) I rode the Ml to work every day for the last three years hoping one day I'd run into you again. She's amused, rather than moved, because she doesn't buy it. 
ELISE Calling would have been easier. 
DAVID I couldn't. 
ELISE Girlfriend wouldn't let you? 
DAVID No girlfriend. She looks at him with continued skepticism. But his expression is dead serious. 
DAVID (CONT'D) Can we go somewhere and talk? She hesitates. It hurt when he didn't call. She's angry at herself for that, but it's the truth. 
ELISE (re: his suit) Don't you have to get to work? 
DAVID I just got sick. 
ELISE "I haven't seen you in three years - - You make me sick" is not an ideal come-on. For the record. David smiles. She's softening. A little. His phone vibrates. He pulls it out of his pocket. 
DAVID One second. 
(PICKING UP) CharlieT can't make breakfast. 
CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.) Why not? 
DAVID And...I might have to push the speech. 
CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.) What? Are you crazy?! 
DAVID I just ran into Elise. He hangs up. 
ELISE You just hung up on your best friend. 
ELISE 
(DUH) Um, you had a girlfriend and you felt guilty. I have a thing about being lied to, David. 
DAVID I swear to God I didn't have your number. I swear on my parents' graves. 
DAVID (CONT'D) I didn't even have a last name to try to track you down. Do you know how many pages come back when you type "Elise" into Google? 
(BEAT) And none of them were you. 
ELISE (after a beat) You really are smooth. 
DAVID That's not fair. 
ELISE It's okay. I like it. I probably shouldn't, but I do. 
(BEAT) It's Sellas. Elise Sellas. 
INT. RICHARDSON'S OFFICE -- DOWNTOWN -- DAY 
McCrady holds open his Planbook to show Richardson an ever shifting diagram. 
RICHARDSON Tell me you're kidding. How could our Path-analysis miss this? McCrady just shakes his head, mystified... Richardson walks to the closet and pulls out his fedora:. 
RICHARDSON 'rlhek,e are they now?` 
MCCRADY Central Park. Bethesda Fountain. 
INT. CENTRAL PARK -- DAY 
David and Elise walk past Bethesda Fountain. 
ELISE I read somewhere you're running again. 
DAVID I haven't announced yet but... soon. 
ELISE I hope I had a little something to do with that. 
DAVID That concession speech I gave sure did. You had everything to do with that. Elise smiles. 
DAVID You know entirely too much about me given how little I know about you. 
ELISE According to Cosmo I'm supposed to keep it that way. 
DAVID According to Maxim, I'm supposed to "maintain eye contact and ask you what you do for a living." It's the first witty comment h6' :s made this time around. He's just barely starting t6Â°'looÂ§`en up. 
ELISE 
(LAUGHS) I'm a dancer. 
DAVID Oh.. 
ELISE Not like that, you pervert. In a dance company. The. Manhattan Modern Ballet. 
DAVID I think you have the wrong idea about me. 
ELISE I think it was the first thing that crossed your mind. 
DAVID Is there a performance of this company coming up that I could watch? 
ELISE Actually, we have a show opening tomorrow night. 
DAVID I'm there. You hungry yet? 
He points at the Boathouse restaurant a few hundred feet down the path they're on. 
ELISE Yeah... 
(BEAT) But I'm not putting out just because you're buying me brunch. 
DAVID We could wait an hour and call it lunch. 
ELISE I bet lines like that work wonders with the "dancers" you normally hang out with. 
DAVID So unfair... 
EXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY 
Richardson and McCrady Step out of a small outdoor bar structure. They, SpotDavid and Elise walking in the side door of the restaurant.',., Somehow Richardson and' McCrady have travelled from downtown Manhattan to the middle of Central Park in the time it took David and Elise to' walk 100 feet...

CHARLIE (CONT'D) Elise, pleasure to see you again. 
(TO DAVID) There's a crowd of people standing around downtown waiting for you. 
ELISE Your speech? 
CHARLIE He's announcing today. 
ELISE At the speech? 
DAVID It's okay. 
CHARLIE What's okay? It's not okay. The one thing you can't be this. time around is impulsive. That's why we're announcing the way we are, 
THAT'S WHY-- 
ELISE God, don't skip this for me. 
DAVID I told you I'm not letting you out of my sight. 
CHARLIE David, what the hell? 
DAVID (to Elise, realizing a way out of his dilemma) Come with me. Come and watch. 
ELISE 
(SMILING) Okay. Her phone buzzes with a text message. 
CHARLIE (to both of them) Great. Perfect solution. Now, let's pay and get you over there. Charlie waves the waiter over to give them the check. 
ELISE Now? 
CHARLIE The speech is in 30 minutes. 
ELISE I can't then. (indicating text message) They just moved my dress rehearsal to noon. David's own sixth sense kicks in. Has he been discovered? 
DAVID We can reschedule the speech. 
ELISE David! 
CHARLIE 
(TO ELISE) Thank you. David looks around for anything out of the ordinary, any sign of Richardson or his men. But. they stay out of view. He thinks they're not on to him yet. 
ELISE I'll meet you right after the rehearsal. 
DAVID Where does your company perform? 
ELISE We're n in our space. There was a`;â¢power ot outage or something. (checking the text) We're using a space" on Murray and West Broadway today. 
CHARLIE 
(REALIZING) That's four blocks from where you're speaking. David reacts: Richardson can't be behind that. 
CHARLIE You can literally walk there after the speech. David nods, his suspicions fading. 
CHARLIE 
(CHECKING WATCH) But we've got to leave right now. 
EXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY 
Richardson and his team watch as David, convinced now he's still undiscovered, stands up and heads to the door with Charlie and Elise. 
MCCRADY The "four blocks" thing was a brilliant move, boss. 
RICHARDSON (putting his hat on) We're not out of the woods yet. He looks down at the inflection points in McCrady's Planbook.

Richardson stands with McCrady on the upper level of a two- story lobby looking out at David arriving for his speech. 
INT. ELISE'S APARTMENT -- DAY 
Elise changes into her dance gear. Big smile on her face. She spots something on her bookshelf (we can't see what) and her smile fades. She takes it and puts it in a drawer. Her phone vibrates. She has a text message: "Power back on at MMB. Rehearsal at noon." 
INT. BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET FROM RSR FINANCIAL -- DAY 
McCrady hangs up a silver cell phone and nods at Richardson: "it's done." Just then Richardson's phone buzzes. The caller ID says: "Mr. Donaldson." 
RICHARDSON Richardson. Yes, sir. Believe me, it was a surprise to me too. But I think we have it under control.

DAVID .I'm here today to honor that, and to announce my intention to run for the United States Senate...

ELISE Don't worry. That's definite.

The audience applauds energetically. David nods "thank you" and steps away from the lectern they set up. He shakes two or three people's hands but then heads inside the building. 
INT. LOBBY OF RSR FINANCIAL -- DAY 
David huddles inside with Charlie. Reporters outside are in front of their cameras filing their stories amidst the lingering crowd. 
CHARLIE Good Morning America at 7am tomorrow, then you have the bankers group... David, are you listening? David's staring out the window. The sunlight has caught the building across the street just right to illuminate Richardson and McCrady on the second floor. 
INT. BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET -- DAY

CHARLIE No, we need this on the nightly-- (catching up to David and 
STOPPING HIM) David... Charlie looks at him for a moment, searching for the right words to say to a friend... 
CHARLIE Every time we get close.. .you do something to derail it. A beat. There's a truth to that. David knows it. But-- 
DAVID This is different. Trust me, it's different. David leaves. 
(COVERING) 'It's not something your mind could :comprehend. 
DAVID You're in a nice suit but the reality is you're just a minion aren't you? David pushes past Richardson and walks into a busy restaurant. McCrady quickly consults his Planbook. 
MCCRADY He's deciding how to-- 
(REALIZING) Uh..oh-- 
INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT -- DAY 
David strides in and goes right to a chair. Stands on it. 
DAVID 
(LOUD) Excuse me ladies and gentleman-- (as people turn and look, 
RECOGNIZE HIM) I'm sorry to disturb your lunch. I have a bit of an emergency. Is there anybody in this room who's ever seen a performance of the Manhattan Modern Ballet? 
EXT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT -- DAY 
From outside, Richardson and McCrady watch. 
RICHARDSON Son of a bitch. 
MCCRADY He's smart. He's very smart. David exits the restaurant from another door. He hurries toward West Broadway. 
EXT. WEST BROADWAY -- DAY 
Not a taxi in sight. David looks for one in vain. Suddenly Richardson emerges from a storefront and, goes to David. 
RICHARDSON Maybe you should try the subway. David holds him in a steely gaze. 
DAVID' Don't all those cab drivers you're diverting have Plans too? What about all the other people looking for cabs in this part of the city right n6t? What about their Plans? The ripples must be endless... Richardson is taken aback that David has figuredthis out. 
DAVID I don't care what you put in my way, I'm not going to give up. David walks off, leaving Richardson standing there. 
MINUTES LATER -- DAY Richardson and McCrady watch David looking for a taxi at a very busy intersection. 
MCCRADY You've got two more minutes keeping taxis off West Broadway before-- 
RICHARDSON 
(FRUSTRATED) I need something that's going to keep him in place longer-- 
EXT. LEONARD ST -- DAY 
On foot, David heads West towards Hudson St. Several taxis pass with their roof lights off;. Suddenly, down the street, he sees one with his roof light on. He runs for. it when-- CRASH -- twenty feet in front of him two cars collide. Metal crunches and glass breaks. This is no fender bender-- 
DAVID Jesus:., (looks for Richardson) Is this how far you people will go?! He rushes toward the accident-- 
EXT. SITE OF ACCIDENT -- DAY 
ARE An hour later. Four police cars and an ambulance. They treating one of the accident"s victims for minor scrapes ]avid is getting intervie,ved by a police officer. 
POLICE OFFICER Unfortunately you're the only witness, Congressman.

POLICE OFFICER A few more minutes. I'm sorry. I know you have to meet somebody. 
DAVID I didn't say I had to meet anyone. 
POLICE OFFICER Well ...I just assumed-- 
EXT. ROOFTOP -- DAY 
Richardson is watching David get interviewed-- 
RICHARDSON Amateur! That's an amateur's mistake! 
BACK TO SCENE -- EXT. SITE OF ACCIDENT -- DAY 
DAVID You're not a real cop, are you? You're one of them. Somebody could have been killed in that crash! Doesn't that make you-- 
"POLICE OFFICER" Sir, calm down. But David's already walking away. 
DAVID Sergeant! He goes to the highest ranking guy on the. scene. 
DAVID I know you heed a statement from me, but do I have to stay here to give it to you or-- 
SERGEANT No, sir, we know ow to get in touch with you. 
RICHARDS6N The next one! 
INT. DANCE STUDIO DAY 
Lauren walks David toward the door with the music behind it. 
LAUREN It goes without saying that I'll kill you if you hurt her. 
(BEAT) And by the way, congratulations on your announcement. 
EXT. 17TH ST -- DAY 
Richardson and McCrady down the street. 
MCCRADY (re: diagram, confused) There are several next ones-- 
RICHARDSON 
(EXASPERATED) I'm blocking them all-- His hand stretches out (as Harry did early on in film) 
MCCRADY Wait, he's-- 
INT. LOBBY / DANCE STUDIO -- DAY 
MUSIC pours out as David opens the door. A quarter of the way open, the door stops dead. 
EXT. DANCE STUDIO -- DAY 
Richardson grabs the front door and pulls. It's sealed shut. It won't budge. 
WHAT THE- 
MCCRADY Hat! Hat! McCrady is behind him He points. at Richardson's fedora, which is on the sidewalk. Fell off when he ran. Richardson sprints to grab it-- 
INT. LOBBY OF DANCE STUDIO --=DAY 
David looks through the narrow space of the open door and sees Elise dancing. The piece she's practicing fuses the gra e -ballet with the raw emotion of modern. She's ï¿½xl eattaking. 
DAVID I'm in serious trouble here... 
EXT. / INT. DANCE STUDIO -- DAY 
Richardson dashes back to the door-- 
MCCRADY 
(CONSULTING FOLIO) Forget it! He's already there... Richardson charges into the lobby to see David staring through the partially open door to the rehearsal room... 
RICHARDSON Dammit ! McCrady's phone buzzes. He pulls it out and looks at the caller ID. 
MCCRADY 
(DREAD) It's Mr. Donaldson. Richardson pulls the fedora off his head and crushes it in his hands. David turns just in time to see this. At the same time David realizes the door is no longer "stuck." 
RICHARDSON Celebrate while you can. They'll just kick it upstairs now You have no idea what you're up against. David just looks at him. He'll deal with that when it comes... 
MCCRADY Sir? Richardson grabs the phone and answers --.going outside to talk. David turns back to the dance studio. He opens the door to get an unobstructed view of Elisee,. She spins, arches, dips. David can't take his eyes off hey` When the artistic director pauses the routine to give notes, Elise gives David a. little wave. Then they start again. David looks back out at Richardson on the street, but he's gone.. 
TNT. ADJUSTMENT BUREAU HEADQUARTERS -- DUSK A defeated Richardson trudges up a long flight of stairs. 
INT. HALLWAY -- DUSK 
Richardson walks down a hallway with an impossibly shiny black floor and enters a doorway marked "Mr. Donaldson." 
INT. MR. DONALDSON'S OUTER OFFICE -- DUSK 
Two secretaries look up at him. 
SECRETARY #1 He's waiting for you. 
INT. MR. DONALDSON'S OFFICE -- DUSK 
Much larger than Richardson's office and on a higher floor. MR. DONALDSON, 45, sits at his desk reading a document. After a moment he signs it at the bottom and looks up, REVEALING Richardson, who is standing awkwardly in front of his superior's desk. Donaldson motions for him to sit down. 
INT. DANCE STUDIO -- DUSK 
now. David talks to Elise, who's showered and dressed 
DAVID You're incredible. How did you get that good? 
ELISE It's all I do. It's the only thing I ever wante& to be. And I started young. 
RICHARDSON Why was it changed? 
DONALDSON Something important. They went from "meant to be together" to "red- letter denied relationship" in a single Plan revision a few years back. As for why, specifically, that's apparently above even my pay grade... 
INT. PLAN B -- NIGHT 
David and Elise dance. He sucks, but doesn't care. A couple of people in the club recognize him and give him thumbs up... 
INT. ADJUSTMENT BUREAU HEADQUARTERS --'NIGHT 
Burdensky and a dejected Richardson walk down the hall. 
RICHARDSON You spend your whole career hoping that one day you'll get a "red- letter" case. Something you can really make a name for yourself with. Finally I get one... and it's. .booby-trapped... 
CLOSE ON THE BAR' Another set of shot glasses hit the bar. UP to REVEAL David and Elise.. 
ELISE Okay, we've al-ready used up an hour, we >etter hurry. She pills him toward the exit. 
DAVID Hurry where? 
INT. MUSTANG CLUB -- NIGHT 
Elise does a sexy, street variation on a two-step to an up- tempo pop-country ballad. David tries to follow along, mostly by bobbing his head with the beat. Sort of with the beat. 
ELISE You've got to let yourself feel the music. 
DAVID I've been told I have trouble feeling. 
ELISE Whoever said that hasn't seen you speak. 
DAVID That's different. I mean-- 
ELISE What? 
DAVID In private. With women AlthOugh that might be changing. Is there any style of dance you can:'t do? 
EXT. HUNTER'S POINT, QUEENS -- NIGHT 
David and Elise walk from the waterfront to the street. 
ELISE Next stop, the best 80s club in the city. You ready? 
DAVID To make an ass of myself for the third time in one night? Â§4`r, 6'. 
ELISE 
(POINTS) Race me to that light. You lose, you dance, I watch. You win, I dance, you watch 
DAVID' What are'the rules of the race--- 
ELISE No rules. 
DAVID Hmmm, could get ugly... He looks down an alley as if he's noticed something. When she looks, he takes off like a bat out of hell-- 
ELISE You bastard! He's got a good lead, so he flips around and runs backwards. 
DAVID Quit complaining and run. She catches up. He spins and digs it out. He can't dance, but he sure can run. He pulls away and wins. 
DAVID Yes!!!! He pumps his arms in a victory dance. 
ELISE 
(PISSED SMILE) That was good. That was very good. 
DAVID You said "no rules". She punches him in the stomach. Hard. He crumples, completely unprepared for it. 
DAVID 
(IT HURTS) Sweet Jesus! Christ on a crutch! 
ELISE 
(GIGGLING) You said you had trouble feeling. 
DAVID You're insane. 
ELISE We. need a cab. He'laughing through the'pain. 
DAVID I'm serious. You're a maniac. You should come with a warning label. 
ELISE I do. You just can't see it with my clothes on. OFF David biting his lip... and PRE-LAPPING the music-- 
INT BACK STAGE -- NIGHT .A company staff member is examining Elise's ankle while the show goes on. David arrives. Sees Elise's face. Tears streaming down her cheeks. Seeing David... 
ELISE If it's broken...my career's over. 
DAVID Don't say that. Don't. 
INT. TAXI -- NIGHT 
The taxi rushes to the hospital. David holds her. Silently trying to comfort her. But he can't look at her. 
EXT. HOSPITAL -- NIGHT 
David carries her from the taxi into the emergency room... 
INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT 
David sits in a black chair, alone, staring at the floor. 
INT. HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM -- NIGHT 
Elise lies on an exam table as -a tech x-rays her ankle. 
INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM NIGHT 
David is still staring at the floor. He looks-up to see Thompson. 
THOMPSON I always hear people saying "you yourself for what can't bla M4' hpens fih other people," but in this case, really, you can. David stands up... . and punnhesThompson in `the face. h T ompson is knocked onto his ass. People in the waiting room stare at David. Almost everyone here knows his fade. He looks at them, unable to summon his usual wit. 
THOMPSON This is what you do, David. 
(GETTING UP) This is what you did the first night you got elected. This is what you did at that college reunion. We give you opportunities people would kill for and you squander them with impulse. It doesn't take a genius to see Elise isn't exactly going to help you with that. 
(MORE) 
THOMPSON (CONT'D) You want to know why you can't have her? Look in the mirror. Thompson leaves. 
INT. HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM -- NIGHT 
More X-rays of Elise's ankle. An orthopedic surgeon enters and examines the images on the computer screen. Elise, her face, still red and tear stained tries to read the 
SURGEON'S FACE 
ELISE How bad is it? The surgeon turns to her with a classic doctor's detachment: 
SURGEON 
ELISE-- 
EXT. HOSPITAL COURTYARD -- NIGHT 
David sits alone on a bench. Thompson arrives. 
THOMPSON You're an educated man. You've read the Greek tragedies`. In the end Fate always wins... David looks back at him in steely silence. 
THOMPSON It a sprain. 
DAVID Really? 
THOMPSON This time. 
(BEAT') Do you really want to watch her lose the only thing she's ever cared about? You just got the tiniest taste of what that looks like... The thought makes David ill. 
THOMPSON Walk away. If you truly love her, walk away. She'll hate you for it...but that way she'll be able to let you go quickly. You can give her that at least. 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT 
David stands alone. Stares at the floor. Finally confronting the fact that he can't beat the forces arrayed against him. Finally ready to make the choice being forced upon him... 
INT. HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM -- DAY 
David enters to find Elise with a huge smile on her face. 
ELISE It's a sprain! It's just a sprain! David gives her a tight hug. 
ELISE It's going to be okay. The doctor said it would heal in' a month. . .maybe even less. 
DAVID You're going to: be fine. 
ELISE They want to do an MRI...to assess the ligament. damage but.: -. They break from them hug. 
DAVID It's; going to be fine. And as incredible of a dancer as you already are, yot're just going to get better and better... DavidV;embraces her again, so she won't see the tears welling in his eyes. 
(BEAT) I guess I'm here to set the record straight. 
DAVID About what? 
HARRY- Thompson was lying when he said they couldn't let you be with 8lise because :it would bring out your reckless side. 
DAVID Why, then? Why do they care so much? 
HARRY 8ecause.,..she's enough, David. If you have =her r tau rtt .ght not need to fill the d side you with votes and ataplause'and dreams of one day becoming p sident... if Harry has:looked straight into David's soul. 
HARRY I've watched you a long time. They're right to want you in the White House. It would be good for the world. That's important but it can't be the only thing that matters. 
DAVID Why are you so different than they are? 
A long beat, then: 
HARRY You know, your Dad was a smart man. He could have been a lot more -- and he wanted to be. So did your brother. But the Plan didn't call for that. This hits David hard. 
HARRY In my job, you implement the Plan... 
(EMOTIONAL) And most of the time.. .you don't even know why... 
(BEAT) I'm sorry... 
DAVID My mom? 
HARRY That wasn't me... that wasn't us at all. David takes all this in. After a;long be t he takes a drink. Then he offers the bottle to Harry, who h a esitates, then takes a drink as well. 
DAVID When Thompson told methe choice as Elise or the White House I barely hesitated. 
D1 ID But the trt t i `is after making that choice I went into a free-fall... Don't get=me wrong, it killed me to see Thompson hurt her...but I used it as an excuse. I think I left her more to save my career than hers. 
(STRUGGLING) Thompson wasn't lying. The press is already talking about me as a future president. I'm phoning in my speeches and I'm still sixteen points up in the polls. 
HARRY The public loves you. 
DAVID Before I met Elise that was all that mattered. Now I hardly notice. She's all I think about. 
(BEAT) Do you know where she's getting married? 
HARRY Front of a judge. Tomorrow morning. 
DAVID Is she happy with him? Tell me she is and I'll walk away. 
HARRY Thompson won't let you get near that courthouse. 
DAVID Harry... is she happy? 
HARRY No. A beat. 
DW-ID I have to get her back.. Harry knows how unlikely that is. 
DAVID Will you help me:ï¿½ Just help me get to her... 
HARDY They'll sense )tOu coming a mile away.' 
DAVID What if Icould move as fast as you can? 
HARRY What do you mean? 
DAVID Teach me about the doors. 
HARRY How do you know about that? 
DAVID The first day, after they caught me, they carried me through one.I thought it was a hallucination at first. Eventually I realized it's how you move around so fast. (off Harry's reluctance) If you don't want to help me because of what they'll do to you...okay, that's your choice. But if this is about protecting me then shouldn't the choice be mine? 
HARRY Do you have any idea how complicated it is to navigate through those doors... how many thousands of permutations there are in even a simple several block journey? 
DAVID You know, when I do town hall meetings I usually get introduced to forty or fifty people between when I walk, through' the door and when I start speaking. But when I'm done with the speech I can call on each one of them by `game. A beat... 
HARRY I've seen you do that (taking tl leap ) The rain is supposed to stop in the nexthou'r. We're going to need all night to do this. And we're going to need aplace surrounded by water to do it. 
MOMENTS LATER Harry and David stand outside a door to a dock office at the end of the pier. Harry dons his hat. 
HARRY Put your hand on my shoulder. And don't let go until we've crossed the threshold. 
David complies. Harry opens the door. 
DAVID Are they ever locked? 
HARRY Maybe if you have a defective hat. They step through the door and onto-- 
David rubs his head. He's exhausted-too. Mentally. 
HARRY Yourbrain can only put so much in at once. Take- a brreak. Da :} , nods. His eyg6,0s' to: Harry' s leather Planbook. He btio#ts to it -- a question: can he look at it., Harry opens tt up to a page in the middle. David's eyes look over the impossibly complex circ$t diagram. 
DAVID Could I ever learn to read that? Harry shakes his head. Impossible. 
DAVID No matter how hard I tried? 
HARRY For the same reason you can't breathe underwater or flap your arms and fly. You're not built to do it. 
DAVID (re: circuit diagram) Is that me? 
HARRY Elise. Her decision tree. What it was a few hours ago, before the rain, before we were down here. David looks at it, then looks away. 
DAVID I want to ask you what it says.. .what she's thinking.. .bit somehow that feels ...wrong. 
HARRY You know what she's thinkin-g,'David -- as much as you need to know. The rest ...well...you're`built to feel that. 
EXT. DANCE COMPANY -- NIGHT

David and Harry examine photos of a blue door at the side of a Tribeca restaurant. 
DAVID The fastest path is getting to the blue door right off the bat...

DAVID But if I can make it...I'.Il have caught them completely bysurprise. 
HARRY Assuming you make it.

TNT. MANHATTAN COUNTY COURT BUILDING -- LOBBY -- DAY Elise and Lauren step into a-polished brass elevator from New York's Tammany Hall days. Her look is distant, disconnected. Not what you're suppoeed to look like on your wedding day.

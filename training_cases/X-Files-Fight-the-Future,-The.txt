NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS, AND SOME "SCENE OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. SNOWSCAPE 
A BLINDING WHITE SCREEN, under which we hear an ominous low end Dolby THX Big Screen rumble. We're not in 19" television land anymore, Toto. As the rumble builds, TWO BLACK FIGURES appear on what now has resolved into a distant horizon. From their movements we can shortly see that the figures are men. Moving along a windswept ice sheet in an otherwise featureless land. 
A LEGEND appears: NORTH TEXAS, 35,000 B.C. 
CLOSER ON THE TWO MEN 
Continuing toward us, we can now see that they are dressed in crude garments made of animal skins. If we squint we can see their hair is long, their jutting foreheads significant of primitive Homo Sapiens. They continue toward us, the wind beating against them, CAMERA IS CRANING DOWN to the snow that lies before them. To LARGE THREE-TOED TRACKS. 
FOLLOWING THE PRIMITIVES 
As they track the three-toed prints to a rocky crevice in the hard-pack ice. The prints stop here, and so do the men. Dropping down into the crevice in pursuit of their quarry. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ICE CAVE 
Dark in here, except where the sunlight penetrates the thick, glassy ice walls. The silhouettes of the Primitives stark against the glistening cavern. The sound of flint being struck, then A TORCH CATCHES FIRE, illuminating their faces. And: 
A CREATURE 
Deeper in the cave. Fleeing the light and the men. We get only a brief glimpse of it in the torch light, seeing that it moves upright on two legs and has gray, dinosaur-like skin. And large black eyes. But it moves quickly enough away that any other identifying feature is lost in the deeper shadows. 
THE PRIMITIVES 
Removing crude weapons made of sharpened bone from under their thick fur garments, and scrabbling into the constricting cavern, giving chase. 
Following them as they moves with animal-like agility through the tightening space. Predatory hunters. Their torchlight catching: 
THE CREATURE 
As it disappears into a tight opening in a smaller crevice leading off the main one. The Primitives entering frame after a moment, only a few steps behind. The LEAD PRIMITIVE dropping to the cave floor, pulling himself into this same tight fissure in pursuit. Splitting off from his partner who exits frame still on the run. 
INT. SMALLER ICE CAVE - HIGH ANGLE DOWN 
The fiery torch comes through first, held by the lead man. Throwing dancing shadows on the walls of what appears to be a box cavern. 
CLOSE ON LEAD PRIMITIVE 
Rising quickly to his feet. Not seeing what the torch illuminates just behind him: The face of a dead Primitive Man, his body frozen into the ice. He does finally notice this, turning to see it, when he's ATTACKED VICIOUSLY FROM BEHIND. 
The torch falls to the floor so that the fight is difficult to see, but it is loud and cruel. The creature squealing wildly as the grunts of the Primitive now turn to the sounds of painful struggle. Until: 
THE SECOND PRIMITIVE MAN 
Suddenly appears, driving his bone weapon into the body of the Creature. Again and again, until the Creature is driven away into the shadows. 
The Second Man grabs the torch now, not to see if his hunting mate has survived, but in pursuit of the Creature. In the light we see that he and his weapon are covered with spatters of OILY BLACK BLOOD. As is the First Primitive whose body lies heaving on the floor. 
The Second Primitive stepping over his hunting mate, stalking the Creature into the shadows, where it has collapsed. The torch finally landing, for the first time, on its face. 
When the torchlight hits its face, the Creature attacks. But the Primitive prevails. He drops his torch and dispatches the already wounded Creature with strong hard stabs of his weapon, one of which penetrates the Creature's eye. 
LOW ANGLE ON THE DEAD CREATURE 
The torch, which lies on the ground, illuminates the dead creature's face. Its wounds are flowing with the oily black blood, which, oddly now, BEGINS TO POOL. As if it has intelligence, sentience. Pooling and traveling into a fissure in the cave floor. And disappearing. 
ANGLE ON THE SECOND PRIMITIVE 
Watching this, unknowing. His chest heaving from the fight, as the spots of Oily Black Blood which have spattered onto him begin to crawl. Crawling toward his eyes and mouth. Causing him to let out grunts of fear. 
Which are the sounds we hear as the CAMERA SLOWLY CRANES UP past the struggling Primitive to the roof of the cave, where the dancing shadows of the torch FADE AWAY with the sounds of struggle. Moving into darkness and silence. But only for a moment. Until: 
SUNSHINE BREAKS THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE CAVE - PRESENT DAY 
Along with the spade of a shovel. And then -- the earthen cave ceiling gives way and A BOY wearing Nikes and an old t-shirt falls through it. Falling PAST CAMERA. We hear a YELL, then a THUD, and a CLATTERING of the shovel that's fallen in with him. Then a pained GASPING. 
Then SEVERAL HEADS appear in the opening. These are BOYS of ten to eleven, staring down into the cave. Hot sunlight blazing in. We have traveled far, far forward in time. 
2ND BOY Hey, Stevie. You okay? 
INT. CAVE - PRESENT DAY 
THEIR POV OF STEVIE 
They start cautiously toward Stevie. CAMERA FINDING their feet. Tracking through the same OILY, BLACK SUBSTANCE we saw bleeding from the creature thirty five thousand years ago. As they move into the shadows, we HOLD ON THE SUBSTANCE....and see it MOVE. It's alive. 
TIME CUT TO: 
EXT. DIRT FIELD - SHORT TIME LATER 
CAMERA RISES out of the dirt hole, finds A GROUP OF NEIGHBORS: 
Concerned PARENTS, KIDS, including Stevie's friends. They're held at a distance by the remaining firemen. Everyone turning their concerned gazes skyward. Looking at: 
A MED-EVAC CHOPPER 
Coming off the sun-setting horizon. Moving toward us at high speed. The WHOP, WHOP of its blade soon shaking the neighborhood as it banks in and around and hovers just over the dirt field. Landing gently on the parched hard scrabble. 
The side door flies open and FIVE HAZ-MAT RESCUE PARAMEDICS jump out carrying a bubble litter. CAMERA PANS THEM to the dirt hole past THE FIRE CAPTAIN. The Haz-Mat Paramedics moving down into the hole. The Fire Captain watches this, then stares toward -- 
DR. BEN BRONSCHWEIG (in shirtsleeves, tie), exiting the chopper, following up the rear. The Captain meeting him in route. 
BRONSCHWEIG (over the chopper) Keep those people back. Get them out of here. 
FIRE CAPTAIN (to his men) Move them all back. (dogging Bronschweig) I sent four men down after the boy. They're not responding. 
Dr. Bronschweig's focus is elsewhere, though. He's making a bee line to the earthen hole where young Stevie is being pulled out and lifted into an enclosed QUARANTINE BUBBLE LITTER by the rescue squad. Bronschweig watches with great concern. Getting a good look now at Stevie's paralyzed body as it passes him. 
ANGLE ON CHOPPER 
As Stevie's body is loaded aboard, the side door is slid shut. The engine throttles up and the chopper takes flight again, almost as quickly as it arrived. The prop wash blowing: 
DR. BRONSCHWEIG 
And the gathering crowd. Bronschweig watches the chopper bank away, then turns his look to: 
THE NEIGHBORHOOD 
Where A SERIES OF UNMARKED CARGO VANS, TRUCKS are rolling in. A fleet of vehicles, driven by what looks like MILITARY PERSONNEL. Most conspicuously TWO WHITE UNMARKED TANKER TRUCKS. (There are NO MARKINGS on these vehicles.) 
RESUME BRONSCHWEIG 
As the Fire Captain moves around to face him off. 
FIRE CAPTAIN What about my men? 
DR. BRONSCHWEIG (brusquely) We're doing all we can. 
And he moves off toward the approaching trucks where the MILITARY PERSONNEL are pulling out tents, tent poles, scientific equipment. Leaving the Captain to wonder what the hell's going on. Watching the first of many REFRIGERATION UNITS being unloaded. The personnel carrying it paying him no mind as they blow past him. Moving RIGHT TO CAMERA and plunging us into BLACK. 
HOLD. Then OVER BLACK, a familiar sound again. The sound of a chopper auguring in. As we FADE UP, revealing we are: 
EXT. TOP OF A SKYSCRAPER - DAY 
The chopper is banking over the side of the building, preparing to touch down on the rooftop where FIFTEEN FBI AGENTS in dark ID windbreakers are standing. A LEGEND appears: FEDERAL BUILDING, DALLAS, TEXAS. ONE WEEK LATER. 
The chopper touches down and, again, the side door is thrown open. But now only one man exits: SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE (S.A.C.) DARIUS MICHAUD. 
Michaud moves with the measured pace of authority, approaching the waiting FBI Agents. One of whom steps up. 
FBI AGENT We've evacuated the building and been through it bottom to top. No trace of an explosive device or anything resembling one. 
S.A.C. MICHAUD Have you taken the dogs through? 
FBI AGENT Yes, sir. 
S.A.C. MICHAUD Well, take them through again. 
This is given as a non-negotiable order, to the somewhat weary FBI man. Who turns back to his charges, Michaud does not register this attitude, though. Something else has caught his attention. Causing him to walk to the edge of the building. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM, seeing what he sees now. 
On an adjacent skyscraper is what appears to be AN FBI AGENT in an ID windbreaker exiting onto the roof. CAMERA CONTINUING AROUND into A CLOSE UP PROFILE of S.A.C Michaud. Staring at this, his jaw set. He doesn't like what he sees. And what he sees is: 
EXT. ROOFTOP OPPOSING SKYSCRAPER - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
Special Agent Dana Scully is coming out the door leading onto the roof. The door slams shut behind her. She, too, is dressed in an FBI windbreaker. She's dialing her cell phone as she moves around the rooftop looking for something. Dialing the number of: 
SCULLY Mulder -- it's me -- 
MULDER (FILTER) Where are you, Scully? 
SCULLY I'm on the roof. 
MULDER (FILTER) Did you find something? 
SCULLY (impatiently) No. I haven't. 
MULDER (FILTER) What's wrong, Scully? 
SCULLY I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here. 
MULDER (FILTER) You're looking for a bomb. 
INT. SNACK AREA AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY 
Mulder takes a few steps down into the windowless room. Moving past the snack machines to a LIGHTED soda machine. 
Finding the correct change and plunking it in. Hitting a button, but... nothing comes out. 
MULDER Oh, come on. 
He beats his fist a couple of times on the front of the machine. 
Nothing. He finds more change. Plunking it in. Hits the button. Nothing. He stares at the machine a minute, then BEATS IT HARD with his fist. Nothing. 
Moving around to the back of the machine, looking for: 
ANGLE ACROSS BACK OF MACHINE 
Mulder's face peering in on the slim space between the machine and the wall. Reaching down and lifting the PLUG on the end of the electrical cord. It isn't plugged in. Realizing now why the machine hasn't spit out his sodas. 
RESUME FRONT ANGLE ON MACHINE 
As Mulder appears, stepping very lightly in front of the machine that he was just pounding away on. Looking at it, then moving quickly to the door he entered through. Grasping the knob, but finding it... LOCKED. He jiggles the knob, pulls on it. But there's no two ways about it, he's locked in. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY 
Scully stands looking at her watch. Wondering where Mulder is. When her CELL PHONE starts ringing. She answers it. 
SCULLY Scully... 
MULDER (FILTER) Scully, I found the bomb. 
SCULLY (thinks he's joking) Where are you, Mulder? 
MULDER (FILTER) I'm in the vending room. 
Scully is on the move, but she doesn't believe him for a second. 
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE VENDING MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Scully appears, heard A POUNDING. Following this noise to the door Mulder is obviously on the other side of. Tries the door. 
SCULLY Is that you pounding? 
INT. SNACK AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY 
Mulder holds his phone to his ear, using his other hand to pound. 
MULDER Scully, get somebody to open this door. 
SCULLY (FILTER) Nice try, Mulder. 
CAMERA FOLLOWING MULDER as he steps back, revealing now that he's gotten the hinged front of the coke machine open. But we can't yet see what's inside. 
MULDER Scully -- listen to me. It's in the coke machine. You've got about fourteen minutes to get this building evacuated. 
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE VENDING MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Scully is shaking her head. Tries the door again. 
SCULLY C'mon. Open the door. 
His response to this is MORE HARD POUNDING. 
SCULLY Mulder? Tell me this is a joke. 
MULDER (FILTER) Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven... 
As he is doing this, Scully is bending to see: 
THE KEYHOLE 
It's been freshly soldered over. 
INT. SNACK AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY 
Mulder stands pacing in front of: 
AN ELABORATELY ENGINEERED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE 
Wired with circuit boards, electric belts and generally looking like it would take an expert a good long time to figure out where to even start. A lot longer than the 13:58 that reads on the digital read-out. 
MULDER ...thirteen fifty six... 
SCULLY (FILTER) Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there. 
The line goes dead. And off Mulder's deepening anxiety, we: 
EXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE BOMB BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
The last of the building occupants are being hauled off in CITY BUSES which have moved in curbside. As these buses pull away, so do the fire trucks that have positioned themselves out front. And the police squad cars. As Mulder and Scully exit the front door. Moving quickly, until Mulder hits mid-plaza and slows. Scully not realizing this for a few steps, then turning. 
SCULLY What are you doing? (off his non-response) Mulder -- 
One last windbreakered Agent is exiting. Moving past them to the last cop car other than the car waiting for Mulder and Scully. 
LAST AGENT OUT All clear. 
Mulder has stopped and is looking back to the building now as Scully hustles back the few steps separating them. 
MULDER Something's wrong. 
ANGLE OVER THEM TO THE WAITING CAR 
As the Last Agent Out's car zooms away. Leaving only their car and the man driving it: a WINDBREAKERED AGENT. 
WINDBREAKERED AGENT What's he doing? 
The plaza is desolate now, void of life. 
MULDER Something's not right... 
SCULLY -- Mulder! Get in the car! 
Scully is pulling him now. Pulling him toward the car and the obviously impatient Windbreakered Agent. 
SCULLY There's no time! 
CUT TO: 
INT. SNACK AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY 
CLOSE ON BOMB. The seconds ticking off now, as it passes the :30 mark. CAMERA PULLING BACK, ADJUSTING to Michaud. His tool chest is closed up, and he is sitting on it improbably. Still staring at the bomb, then pulling his head down in what appears to be resignation. As the seconds tick away. 
CUT BACK TO: 
EXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE BOMB BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
Mulder has relented now, against his better instincts. Moving with Scully to the car, faster as they go. The Windbreaker Agent standing in the open door of the driver's side. Getting in behind the wheel... 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. VENDING MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
S.A.C. MICHAUD 
Sitting motionless in front of the bomb as the seconds tick down. 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1- -- 
HARD CUT BACK TO: 
EXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE BOMB BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
Mulder and Scully getting in the car. TRACKING BACKWARDS with them now as the Agent driving pulls away, getting only thirty, maybe forty yards when: the BOMB DETONATES and the building EXPLODES. And this is no fatwa symbolic little terror strike. This is Oklahoma City. Or do we say, Independence Day. 
REVERSE ANGLE ON CAR 
As all the windows blow out and the car is lifted up, slamming into the corner of a parked car. The air so quickly full of debris that it would seem the whole city has been destroyed. 
RESUME BUILDING 
As the debris starts to clear somewhat, much of it still floating to the ground, though. We see the fires raging on every floor. That most of the front of the building has been torn away and we can see right into many floors. 
RESUME ANGLE ON CAR 
Where it sits half cocked against a parked car. The air is full of debris, particulated matter. The rear door of the squad car opens now and Mulder gets out, covered with glass. Moving to the front passenger door, opening it for Scully. 
MULDER (with darkest irony) Next time you're buying. 
EXT. AERIAL SHOT OF WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY 
HIGH ABOVE the U.S. capital, the entire beltway. With a LEGEND, to establish. 
LOWER AND TIGHTER NOW 
On the J. Edgar Hoover Building, FBI Headquarters. Descending low on the three-sided monolith and its large interior courtyard. As another LEGEND appears, under: 
WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) In light of Waco, and Ruby Ridge... 
CUT TO: 
INT. FBI OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL REVIEW - DAY 
A formal hearing. Several ASSISTANT DIRECTORS sit at a head table, going over documents. NAME PLACECARDS in front of them. 
PANNING the group, the sound of papers shuffling, the occasional clearing of a throat creating a stale air of importance, under: 
DR. BRONSCHWEIG This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest. 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen. 
DR. BRONSCHWEIG Of what? 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community. (beat) Maybe a small roadside memorial. 
He watches the CSM exit, then back to the prostrate fireman. 
CLOSE ON PROSTRATE FIREMAN 
There is more movement within his body. Within his chest and neck, as if the creature gestating inside is continuing to stretch and grow. So that now we can see one of its BLACK EYES staring from through the clear flesh of the fireman. An eye which BLINKS at us. As we: 
CUT TO: 
INT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
Mulder and Scully appear at the end of a long hall. Moving TOWARD CAMERA where a YOUNG NAVAL GUARD sits in f.g. As a LEGEND appears, to establish. 
Mulder and Scully moving the long distance to the Guard's station. Where the Guard looks up at them with military scrutiny. 
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD ID and floor you're visiting. 
They both show their FBI IDs. 
MULDER We're going to the morgue. 
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel. 
MULDER On whose orders? 
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD General McAddie's. 
Mulder doesn't miss a beat. 
MULDER General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately. 
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD I don't know anything about that. 
MULDER Well, call General McAddie. 
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD I don't have his number. 
MULDER They can patch you in through the switchboard. 
The Guard is nervous about this, checking his watch. He picks up the phone, going through a large directory. 
MULDER Hey! We don't have time to dick around here watching you demonstrate your ignorance in the chain of command. The order came direct from General McAddie. Call him. We'll conduct our business while you confirm authorization. 
Mulder is already directing Scully past the Naval Guard who tentatively picks up the phone again. 
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD (to their backs) Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization. 
MULDER Thank you. 
LEADING Mulder and Scully, moving they've pulled off a con. 
MULDER Why is a morgue suddenly off limits on orders of a general? 
CUT TO: 
INT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - MORGUE FREEZER - NIGHT 
TRACKING TABLE HEIGHT across gurneys where white sheet-wrapped bodies lie. CAMERA LANDING ON Scully. Standing next to Mulder who is undoing the peculiar ropey stitching on the sheet used to secure the bodies. 
SCULLY This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas? 
MULDER According to this tag. 
SCULLY And you're looking for? 
SCULLY I can tell you that without even looking at him. (off Mulder's look) Conclusive organ failure due to proximal exposure to source and flying debris. 
Scully pulls out an autopsy report that was laid on the gurney under the body of the sheet-wrapped corpse. 
SCULLY This body has already been autopsied, Mulder. You can tell from the way it's been wrapped and dressed. 
Undeterred, Mulder works to get the sheet off. The first thing we notice is that he's still in his fireman's uniform. His face looks familiar to us, not because we know him, but because of the translucency of skin we saw in the other fireman. (We will also notice he's missing an arm, a leg and large part of his torso.) 
MULDER Does this fit the description you just read me, Scully? 
Scully comes around, reacting to what she sees. 
SCULLY Oh my God. This man's tissue... 
Scully is quickly removing a pair of latex gloves, stretching them on to palpate the man's tissue. 
Mulder starting up the street when he notices: 
MULDER'S POV 
Kurtzweil has stepped from between two apartments. He's staring at Mulder, nodding furtively to him. Then stepping back. 
RESUME MULDER 
Slows, then speeds up. 
EXT. SPACE BETWEEN TWO APARTMENTS - NIGHT 
Mulder appears at the end of the narrow walkway, finding Kurtzweil tucked a few yards in. 
KURTZWEIL See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you. 
MULDER Not according to the men in blue. 
KURTZWEIL What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states. 
MULDER They want to discredit you -- for what? 
KURTZWEIL For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth. 
MULDER You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why. 
KURTZWEIL You know my work? 
MULDER (pointedly) Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government -- 
KURTZWEIL I don't either, but it sure sells books. 
He says it with an ironic smile. Causing Mulder to turn and start off. But Kurtzweil hurries to grab him, to prevent this. 
KURTZWEIL I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder? 
MULDER How? 
KURTZWEIL I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper. 
MULDER You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why? 
KURTZWEIL According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder? 
MULDER It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago. 
KURTZWEIL And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that. (beat) What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas? 
MULDER Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak? 
Kurtzweil is getting intense now. 
KURTZWEIL I'm saying it wasn't the Hanta virus. 
They are both given a start when a POLICE CRUISER rolls by on the street, giving a burp of its siren. It rolls past as the two men tuck in tighter. 
MULDER What was it? 
KURTZWEIL When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins. 
MULDER What killed those men? 
KURTZWEIL What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect. 
MULDER I'll know soon enough. 
KURTZWEIL (worked up) What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved. 
MULDER A plague? 
KURTZWEIL The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon. 
MULDER Negotiating with whom? 
KURTZWEIL I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government. 
MULDER And they tell me I'm paranoid. 
KURTZWEIL Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late. 
Kurtzweil turns, starts off. Mulder stares after him. Then: 
MULDER How can I reach you? 
KURTZWEIL You can't. 
Mulder moves to catch up to Kurtzweil, pulling out his cell phone. Kurtzweil stops, turns. Truly and intensely paranoid. Mulder makes him take the cell phone. 
They are walking amid BOXES of evidence. STACKS of debris. There are FORENSIC TECHS sorting through this material. It looks like the most tedious and painstaking job in the world. 
MULDER I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found. 
FIELD AGENT We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington. 
MULDER Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.? 
FIELD AGENT Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town. 
MULDER Have you examined them? 
FIELD AGENT No. Just fossils, far as I know. 
Mulder is nodding, when both men look off at something that's caught their attention o.s. 
MULDER I'd like this person to take a look, if you don't mind. 
THEIR POV - AGENT SCULLY 
Standing in the doorway to the lab. She looks at Mulder as if she's come in spite of her misgivings. Moving toward them now. 
FIELD AGENT Let me just see if I can lay my hands on what you're looking for. 
The Field Agent nods to Scully as he passes, exiting deeper into the room. Leaving Mulder and Scully by themselves momentarily. 
MULDER You said you weren't coming? 
SCULLY I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen. 
MULDER What did you find? 
SCULLY (voice lowering pointedly) Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now. (off Mulder's look) The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body. 
MULDER How was it contracted? 
SCULLY That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat. 
Mulder's reaction is postponed, or at least subdued by the reappearance of the field agent. 
FIELD AGENT Like I said, these are fossils, and they weren't near the blast center, so they aren't going to tell you much. 
SCULLY May I? 
He offers Scully the small glass vials in which the bone fragments have been separated. She takes them, looking at them on her way over to the microscope. Tapping out a tiny fragment onto the viewing bed. She puts her eyes down to the stereoscope eyepieces, then almost immediately looks up at Mulder who translates this look almost instantly. 
MULDER You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found. 
FIELD AGENT Show you right on a map. 
Off Mulder and Scully's traded looks: 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SMALL PUBLIC PARK - WEST TEXAS - DAY 
The domed white tent is still in place, the fleet of trucks and equipment surrounding it unmanned. Several large sound-dampened generators still hum away, but the work being done here would be a mystery to anyone who didn't have access to the tent. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DOMED TENT - DAY 
An electric Bobcat-like bulldozer maneuvers a very high tech-looking CLEAR CONTAINER to the edge of the earthen hole. The container has monitors and gauges on it, oxygen tanks and what looks like a circulation refrigeration unit. A self-contained life support system. The inside of the container is covered with a thin layer of frost. 
When the small bulldozer gets the container over near the hole, several technicians lift it down off the shovel, hand carrying it toward the hole opening. As Dr. Bronschweig APPEARS, moving to a ladder that leads down into the hole. He's dressed in a haz-mat suit, with the hood off. 
DR. BRONSCHWEIG I need to have those settings checked and re-set. I need a steady minus two Celsius through the transfer of the body, after I administer the vaccine. 
The men nod to Bronschweig, begin checking the settings as Bronschweig puts his hood on, starts down into the hole, through the clear hatch. 
INT. SMALLER ICE CAVE - DAY 
The refrigeration vents are still pumping in arctic air when Dr. Bronschweig appears descending a fixed ladder. It is dark in here, save for the ice blue glow of light coming from the plastic draped area where we saw the fireman acting as an incubator/host for some kind of organism growing inside him. 
Bronschweig steps over to this area, moves aside the plastic drapery to enter. 
ANGLE INSIDE, PLASTIC LINED AREA 
Where the body of the fireman is still inside the quarantine bubble litter in f.g. Bronschweig takes out of his pocket a SYRINGE and an AMPULE. Turning now to the body. Stepping to it. Moving a work light, as he had done for the Cigarette Smoking Man, so that it shines on the face of the fireman. But when he does this, Bronschweig nearly JUMPS, his breath stolen away. Reacting to: 
ANGLE ON FIREMAN'S BODY 
The chest and torso have imploded. It has been turned into a muddy mass of blood-stained jelly; bone and tissue melted into an oozing mass which has sunken due to the fact that the creature which was inside is now gone. 
CAMERA WHIPS from Bronschweig to the wall. To the temperature gauge which reads about 6 degrees Celsius. WHIPPING BACK to Bronschweig who is now panicked. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
Holds the door. After a moment the W.M.M. enters past the Valet. As the screams of the children continue to rise and fall. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUBURBAN LONDON ESTATE - A BEAUTIFUL STUDY - EVENING 
The Well-Manicured Man enters, picks up a blinking line. Through a window he can still see the children playing. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN Yes. 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN (FILTER) We have a situation. The members are assembling. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN Is it an emergency? 
INTERCUT WITH TIGHT CSM AT INT. KENSINGTON BUILDING (NEXT LOC.) 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN Yes. A meeting is set. Tonight in London, to determine a course. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN Who called this meeting? 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis. 
This pronouncement has the power of ending any further questions. An immediate sense of gravity of the situation. The W.M.M. hangs up, moves to the window where he sees some of the HELP is running from the house. The children have all gathered around a BOY who seems to have hurt himself. He's lifted and being carried by the man who's called the W.M.M. into the house. 
Off the Well-Manicured Man's concern, we: 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT 
A discreet Town Car pulls up out front an understated building in a better West End neighborhood. A driver exits coming around for the Well-Manicured Man who is already exiting, moving to the building. As a LEGEND appears: KENSINGTON, LONDON: 8:01 PM. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KENSINGTON BUILDING - NIGHT 
The Well-Manicured Man is admitted by a Valet. The interior has the well-heeled look of money, or a finely appointed residence that no one lives in. The Valet takes the W.M.M.'s coat. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN Has Strughold arrived? 
VALET They're in the library. 
He leads the W.M.M. down a hall, to: 
INT. LARGE STATELY LIBRARY - NIGHT 
A GROUP OF MEN are standing, looking at something on a TV monitor. A surveillance video. They turn when the W.M.M. enters. CAMERA FAVORING A SMALL LEAN MAN with close-cropped hair. 
He is at once elegant and imposing with eyes that hold you with laser-like acuity. He is CONRAD STRUGHOLD. 
The others are of various ethnicities, tailored and dignified. This might be a collection of U.N. delegates. Indeed some are. 
Their business here, however, doesn't represent anyone's interests but their own. As tipped by the attendance of a GROUP ELDER from the U.S. who we've come to know. 
But, more importantly, by the Cigarette Smoking Man who holds the VCR remote. He pauses the picture. 
STRUGHOLD We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg. 
The non-response to this has the same effect as a reprimand. But the W.M.M. will not apologize of kowtow. 
STRUGHOLD While we've been made to wait, we've watched surveillance tapes which have raised more concerns. 
The Well-Manicured Man glances to the TV, sees the frame paused. 
HIS POV OF TV MONITOR 
Where Mulder and Scully's faces are seen in a hallway that we recognize as the Bethesda Naval Hospital. 
RESUME WELL-MANICURED MAN 
WELL-MANICURED MAN More concerns than that? 
STRUGHOLD We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves. 
GROUP ELDER (speaking up) The virus has mutated. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN On its own? 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN Into what? 
STRUGHOLD A new extraterrestrial biological entity. 
It takes a moment to sink in. The weight of this fact. 
MULDER You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue? 
SCULLY (nodding) The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it. 
MULDER And you've never seen anything like that? 
SCULLY No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests -- 
Mulder is listening to all this while looking down at his feet: 
MULDER This looks like new grass to you? 
SCULLY It looks pretty green for this climate. 
Mulder stops, kneels, touches the thick green carpet of turf. He digs around, lifting up a corner of a new square. 
MULDER Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say. 
SCULLY (looking off) All the equipment is brand new. 
MULDER No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks. 
They both turn, looking at something that's caught their attention on the street where their rental car is parked. Three kids, all of whom we recognize from earlier. Stevie's "friends". 
Tooling down the street on new BMX bikes. Reacting to Mulder's loud WHISTLE. This stops them, staring at Mulder blankly across the distance. 
MULDER Hey! 
They don't answer. Just keep staring, squinting into the sun. Mulder and Scully start walking toward them. 
SCULLY Do you live around here? 
2ND BOY Yeah. 
As the Agents approach. 
MULDER You see anybody digging here? 
The kids don't answer quickly. 
2ND BOY Not supposed to talk about it. 
SCULLY You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that? 
3RD BOY Nobody. 
MULDER Nobody. Same nobody who put this park in? That new equipment... (off the boys guilty looks) They buy you these bikes? 
The kids shift uncomfortably. 
SCULLY I think you better tell us. 
2ND BOY We don't even know you. 
SCULLY Well, we're FBI agents. 
2ND BOY You're not FBI agents. 
MULDER How do you know? 
2ND BOY Cause FBI agents wear like suits and goofy ties. And dresses like my mom wears to church. Like on that one show. 
Mulder and Scully pull their badges. The kids' mouths drop. 
MULDER Maybe you've been watching too much TV. 
3RD BOY They all left twenty minutes ago. 
4TH BOY Going that way. 
The kids all pointing in the same direction. 
EXT. CENTRAL TEXAS HIGHWAY - LATE DAY 
As Mulder and Scully's rental car RACES by at high speed. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MULDER AND SCULLY'S RENTAL CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
Mulder at the wheel, foot to the floor. Scully's got a map out. The mood is urgent, tense. 
MULDER Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks? 
SCULLY I don't know, Mulder. 
MULDER And where are they going with it? 
WIDE ANGLE OVER TRACKS TO MULDER AND SCULLY 
They move toward their car, but the train is coming fast. Mulder and Scully stop and wait, watching the train. As the engine breaks frame, eclipsing Mulder and Scully from view. And as it passes by we see TWO VERY FAMILIAR WHITE TANKERS loaded piggyback atop flat bed cars. 
The train, which is not much longer than this, passes. And Mulder and Scully make a mad dash for their car. The lights come on and Mulder swings the vehicle into a hard accelerating turn, taking the spoke of the intersection that parallels the tracks. As the car hauls ass after the train, we: 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. OPPOSITE END OF MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT 
The rails come up a grade where they appear out of a long bending turn. Exiting the mountain pass near the summit of the mountain. And now HEADLIGHTS appear, bouncing toward us. It's Mulder and Scully's rental chugging up the grade. 
And now pulling to a stop as it REACHES CAMERA. Then the car doors open and Mulder and Scully exit. Putting jackets against the cold desert night. Running over the gravel on the rail bed into sharp f.g. 
SCULLY What do you think it is? 
MULDER I have no idea. 
They start out toward it anyway, whatever it is. But the image that we see next might cause us to ask the same question. 
REVERSE ANGLE -- MULDER AND SCULLY'S FORMER POV 
The Agents are moving off the tracks now, picking their way toward the horizon where, at the edge of the great plateau that lays out before them, there are TWO GIANT GLOWING WHITE DOMES. 
It is otherwise pitch dark out, almost giving the impression that the domes are floating. 
It would give the distinct impression of otherworldliness, if we hadn't seen a similar, smaller glowing dome over the dirt field where the boys found the skull. And if we could not see the lights of the TRAIN rolling to a stop near the mysterious domes. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. GREAT PLATEAU - NIGHT - HIGH WIDE ANGLE 
SLOWLY CRANING DOWN as Mulder and Scully move through the low scrub of the high desert. Moving towards us as CAMERA CONTINUES ITS SLOW CRANE DOWN, REVEALING in f.g. the tops of CORN STALKS (yes, corn stalks.) What is the perimeter edge of: 
REVERSE CRANE DOWN (TO MATCH) 
Acres and acres of corn fields, laying out before us in the dark night. Running all the way to the WHITE DOMED TENTS in the b.g. 
Mulder and Scully enter the perimeter edge, disappearing into: 
EXT. ACRES OF CORN - NIGHT 
TRACKING WITH Mulder and Scully as they move through the field. 
SCULLY This is weird, Mulder. 
MULDER Very weird. 
SCULLY Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert? 
MULDER Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there. 
CONTINUE TRACKING as they move through the tall uniform rows. 
ANGLE BEHIND THE AGENTS 
Shooting down the long straight rows. CRANING UP to REVEAL DOMES once again. Like space ships that have landed. 
CUT TO: 
OPPOSITE PERIMETER OF THE FIELD OF CORN 
The Agents exit the edge of the crop field. They have come upon the glowing tents now. Tall and pillowy against the dark sky. 
There is no evidence of anyone about. No sound, no signs. 
Mulder and Scully stand at the edge of the field for a moment. Then move cautiously across an open area to one of the domes. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WHITE DOME TENT - NIGHT 
Mulder pulls open the steel door leading in. It opens with a SUCKING SOUND which suggests the interior is pressurized. And as he and Scully step in -- they both JUMP when LARGE FANS just overhead hit them both with hard blasts of air. 
Stepping quickly out of the downward blasting air, into the still silence of the space beyond. 
SCULLY Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated. 
MULDER For the purpose of what? 
HIGH OVERHEAD ANGLE 
Our view is down through the crosswires and cables that create the tension support. The effect is a combination of simplicity and perfect function. Stark and high tech. The flooring is gray and flat, featureless. But we don't yet see from this angle exactly what the white domed tent houses. 
Though the air is still and there is no movement of any kind, there is a sound that permeates the interior. A STEADY HUM. Almost electrical hum, but different. 
Mulder and Scully move together toward the middle of the space. 
EXT. ACRES OF CORN - NIGHT - MULDER AND SCULLY - VARIOUS HANDHELD 
Running flat out now, knocking away the stalks and leaves that block their way. 
Following and leading shots. 
POVs and Tracking shots. 
And chasing angles, as the Agents run through the only cover they've got. As: 
ANGLE JUST OVER THE TOP OF CROPS 
The unmarked helicopters swoop right overhead, their BRIGHT SPOTLIGHTS searching and cutting through the cornrows. As the Agents zig and zag just out of the discovering beams. As the choppers zoom right over their heads. 
REVERSE ON CHOPPERS 
Traversing the field, then doing sharp banking turns and swooping back over the field now in low drifting hovers. The wash from the blades knocking the corn stalks down so as to reveal anything hidden within. 
The bright spots making sure that nothing might escape detection. 
LOW ANGLE - CAMERA SEARCHING AND FINDING SCULLY 
as she runs up INTO FRAME. She's lost sight of: 
SCULLY Mulder?! 
ANGLE ELSEWHERE ON MULDER 
As he too runs to a stop. Hearing his name. 
MULDER Scully?! 
RESUME SCULLY 
Reacting to the sound of her name, but there's no time to find her bearings on Mulder. Not before she has to take flight again. As one of the choppers appears overhead, hovering into view. Knocking the corn down in a path moving straight toward her. 
CAMERA LEADING HER as she runs from the oncoming craft. PASSING CAMERA to the left, as the chopper passes CAMERA RIGHT. 
CUT TO: 
TRACKING FAST WITH MULDER 
Beating his way through the corn like Bomba through the jungle. 
Matching this action, as Mulder runs toward us. When one of the unmarked helicopters BREAKS INTO FRAME in an intersecting path, its BEAM passing right over Mulder and ILLUMINATING HIM. But while it doesn't slow Mulder down, the helicopter maneuvers into a hard banking turn, sweeping over the far end of the corn field and heading RIGHT BACK AT MULDER - AT US. 
CUT TO: 
NEW LOW ANGLE ON EDGE OF CORN FIELD 
Where Mulder bursts out of the perimeter, turning on a quick dime and running an out pattern, just before the chopper BURSTS into frame overhead, its search beam narrowly missing Mulder. 
NEW ANGLE ON MULDER 
Running the corner of the field, looking frantically down each corn row until he comes to a stop. No sign of: 
MULDER Scully?! 
Mulder reacting to the sound of her response: 
SCULLY (distant o.s.) Mulder! 
NEW ANGLE ON SCULLY 
She's exiting the field behind him. Running toward him, and when she gets to him they both break into a run across the desert. CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM as they sprint away. 
FOLLOWING THEM until they both start to slow. Slowing to a stop in the darkness. Turning to see: 
THEIR POV 
The helicopters have disappeared. 
RESUME MULDER AND SCULLY 
Reacting to this. 
SCULLY Where'd they go? 
MULDER I don't know. 
Then they both turn again and continue running. As fast as their feet will take them. Back towards the bluff where their car is parked. 
EXT. BLUFF OVERLOOKING CORN FIELDS - NIGHT 
Where Mulder and Scully's car is parked. Stillness, until Mulder and Scully's heads appear as they climb up from the direction of the corn fields. They get in their car and start it quickly. Mulder turns the ignition, but the car doesn't start immediately. He turns it over and over but it won't kick. 
As he does this, unbeknownst to the agents ONE OF THE BLACK HELICOPTERS rises up from below the bluff, appearing in their rear windshield. Hovering just behind the car like a giant bumblebee. Just as... 
Sitting at a booth at the dark rear of the establishment. Mulder enters frame, sitting down across from him. Kurtzweil is jumpy, but he sees from Mulder's expression that something's up. 
KURTZWEIL You found something? 
MULDER Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks. 
KURTZWEIL What? 
MULDER I'm not sure. A virus -- 
KURTZWEIL -- You saw this experiment? 
MULDER What did it look like? 
MULDER There were bees. And corn crops. 
Kurtzweil smiles at Mulder, laughs with nervous excitement. Mulder doesn't quite realize it yet, but this is news to him. 
MULDER What are they? 
Kurtzweil slides from his seat, rising. 
KURTZWEIL What do you think? 
MULDER A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus. 
KURTZWEIL That would be my guess. 
MULDER Your guess? 
But Kurtzweil doesn't respond to this. He's moving toward the back of the bar. Mulder slides out, pursuing him. 
ANGLE ON BARMAID 
The few PATRONS sitting at the bar, all turning in reaction to this sudden flurry of activity. 
INT. REAR OF DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
Near the bathrooms. Mulder catches up to Kurtzweil. 
MULDER What do you mean, your guess? 
Kurtzweil doesn't stop. So Mulder must physically stop him. 
MULDER You told me you had answers. 
KURTZWEIL Yeah, well I don't have them all. 
MULDER You've been using me -- 
KURTZWEIL I've been using you?! 
MULDER You didn't know my father -- 
KURTZWEIL I told you -- he and I were old friends -- 
MULDER You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you? 
Mulder is getting heated, rough with Kurtzweil. When, unexpectedly A MAN suddenly exits the bathroom. REACTING to this scene. Kurtzweil uses the moment to break from Mulder. Slipping out the back door. Mulder takes a beat, then goes after him. 
Pushing out the back door into the blinding brightness. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - DAY 
Mulder busts out the back door, chasing Kurtzweil. 
MULDER Kurtzweil! 
Kurtzweil turns to him. With restrained ferocity. 
KURTZWEIL You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you. 
MULDER Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters. 
KURTZWEIL And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder. 
And with that he turns now, striding off. Leaving Mulder to deal with the excellent logic of this. When suddenly Mulder reacts to A NOISE. Somewhere above him. 
MULDER'S POV 
Up on a fire escape, A MAN is moving. Mulder can only see his feet and legs from this angle, but it is clear he has been watching Mulder. Upon being spotted, the figure slides away and disappears. 
ANGLE FROM INSIDE FIRE ESCAPE BUILDING 
We get a glimpse of the man who was watching him. A face we recognize as that of the man who brushed past Mulder coming out of the vending room, not long before the building in Dallas blew. He is moving quickly now, disappearing into the shadows. CAMERA TILTING DOWN to find: 
SCULLY Something's wrong... (fighting for clarity) I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm... 
Mulder lays her down on the floor during this. Scully continues to speak, though her eyes are not focusing. She is limp in Mulder's arms. 
SCULLY ...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat. 
MULDER I think you're in anaphylactic shock 
SCULLY No -- it's -- 
Her voice is getting thin now, too. 
MULDER Scully -- 
SCULLY I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance. 
And Mulder is on his feet in a flash, running for: 
CUT TO: 
INT. MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
CLOSE OVER PHONE as Mulder races into the apartment, dashing TOWARD CAMERA, picking up the receiver, dialing. HOLDING ON THE PHONE during this action. TILTING UP for: 
MULDER This is Special Agent Fox Mulder. I have an emergency -- I have an agent down -- 
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
SCULLY - HANDHELD 
Picked up and one-two-three loaded on a gurney by TWO PARAMEDICS. 
1ST PARAMEDIC Can you hear me? Can you say your name? 
Scully is trying, but the words won't come out. 
1ST PARAMEDIC She's got constriction in the throat and larynx -- are you breathing okay? 
He lays his head down to her mouth. 
1ST PARAMEDIC Passages are open. Let's get her in the van -- 
NEIGHBORS are in the hall now, along with Mulder. Who is moving beside the Paramedics as they hustle the gurney down the hall. 
1ST PARAMEDIC Coming through people -- here we go. Coming through -- 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUED HAND HELD 
The Paramedics bang out the front door, stutter-stepping the gurney down to the walk, to their EMT VAN which sits at the curb with the LIGHT BAR FLASHING. Mulder following close by. 
MULDER She said she had a taste in the back of her throat -- there was no pre-existing allergy to bee-stings -- the bee that stung her may have been carrying a virus -- 
2ND PARAMEDIC A virus? 
1ST PARAMEDIC Get on the radio, tell them we have a cytogenic reaction, we need an advise and administer -- 
They get her to the back of the vehicle, guiding the gurney in with experienced hands. Scully's eyes are on Mulder as she's slid into the brightly lit interior. 
The 1st Paramedic blocks Mulder somewhat as he steps toward the van, anticipating that he's going with them to the hospital. But the doors are closing on him before he gets an opportunity. 
FOLLOWING MULDER around to the driver's side of the van now, moving to the driver's window where THE DRIVER can be seen in the rear view mirror, his eyes watching Mulder. 
ON MULDER 
A moment of vague recognition -- a catch in his step. 
RESUME 
As Mulder's momentum carries him to the driver's window where se see again the man from the vending room, who was also surveilling Mulder. And he has a HANDGUN pointed at Mulder, which he FIRES THROUGH THE WINDOW. The glass shattering. 
RESUME MULDER 
Throwing himself away backward, but the bullet catches him in the head. Blood and glass spraying onto the side of the van. He goes down to the ground -- as the paramedic van accelerates fast away. 
LOW ANGLE REVERSE ON MULDER 
Lying in the street, his head bleeding profusely. While in the b.g., A SECOND AMBULANCE IS SPEEDING TO THE SCENE. As it skids to a stop and TWO NEW PARAMEDICS jump out, we: 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT 
A MEDIUM SIZED PRIVATE JET is taxiing down an alley off the main runway where a 747 is speeding toward takeoff. The private jet turning TOWARD CAMERA and nosing into f.g. 
NEW ANGLE ON TARMAC 
MULDER Are we being watched? 
SKINNER I'm not taking any chances. 
Mulder nods. Pulling now at the bandage on his head. Peeling it away and revealing the wound beneath. 
MULDER I need your clothes, Byers. 
BYERS Me? 
SKINNER What are you doing? 
MULDER I've got to find Scully. 
FROHIKE Do you know where she is? 
MULDER No. But I know someone who might have an answer. Who better. 
Mulder is undoing his hospital gown now, his white buns gracing the screen for the first time in history. As he ducks into the bathroom. As the men left standing in the room all look to Byers, reluctantly removing his duds. Off this: 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT 
ANGLE OVER MAN IN A SUIT standing with his back to Mulder's room, reading a section of a newspaper (the rest of the paper sitting on a chair, as if the man's possibly set up here.) As the door to Mulder's room opens in the b.g. and Frohike appears. 
Frohike keeps his eyes on the Man as Langly appears now, followed by...Byers? We can't see clearly as the other two block our POV and the third man out doesn't show us his face. The threesome starts down the hall, their footsteps drawing the attention of the Man in a Suit. 
ANGLE OVER MULDER AND THE OTHER GUNMEN 
As they head TOWARD CAMERA. Walking at a pace. In the b.g. the Man in the Suit is drifting toward Mulder's hospital room. 
ANGLE ON MAN IN SUIT 
Suspicious. He moves to the door, looks in the little glass window. Seeing...Byers, the sheets pulled up to his nose to hide his beard and mustache. Skinner standing next to him, talking on the phone. 
The Man in the Suit looking down to the end of the hall again. 
RESUME ANGLE OVER MULDER AND THE GUNMEN 
As Mulder and his two flankers MOVE RIGHT TO CAMERA. Mulder is taking a cell phone being handed to him by Frohike. Dialing on the move. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT 
A FIGURE appears at the end of the alley, moving toward us. It could be Mulder from this distance, but as the figure comes closer we recognize him as Kurtzweil. Moving into the f.g., checking behind him, ahead of him. Jumpy. 
He takes a cautious beat, then moves to the door leading into the bar (established), reaching for the knob. Opening it, finding the Well-Manicured Man standing there. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN Dr. Kurtzweil, isn't it? Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil? 
KURTZWEIL Jesus Christ. 
Kurtzweil is shaken by the sight of this man. Backpedaling a bit, looking around and behind him for an ambush. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN You're surprised. Certainly you've been expecting some response to your indiscretion. 
The W.M.M. steps out of the doorway, following Kurtzweil. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN I'm quite sure whatever you told Agent Mulder, you have your good reason. It's a weakness in men our age; the urge to confess. (stopping his walk) I forgive you that. 
Kurtzweil is thrown by the words, and the delivery. Stopping his backward progress. Studying this upright and civil man. 
KURTZWEIL What are you doing here? What do you want from me? 
WELL-MANICURED MAN You must try to understand, what I'm here to do is only to protect my children. You and I have but short lives left. I can only hope the same isn't true for them. 
On this note, Kurtzweil turns and hoofs it back in the direction from which he came. TRACKING BACK WITH HIM until HEADLIGHTS hit his face. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
A TOWN CAR has pulled into the alley behind him. Accelerating fast down the narrow corridor. Effectively trapping Kurtzweil in. As he squints into its headlights, then turns back with fear in his eyes to the W.M.M. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT 
Where a figure is coming down the street toward us. 
Running, it's Mulder, going balls out. Running to the entrance of the bar and yanking open the door. 
INT. DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT 
Moderately crowded as Mulder enters, stopping to catch his breath. Moving to the back of the bar. Looking for: 
THE BOOTH WHERE HE MET KURTZWEIL EARLIER 
Mulder sits stunned by this. As if somehow his destiny has been validated, if not pre-ordained. Or maybe just justified. 
MULDER Why are you telling me this? 
WELL-MANICURED MAN I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked. 
MULDER What happened to Kurtzweil? 
WELL-MANICURED MAN As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future. 
MULDER Where is he? 
WELL-MANICURED MAN Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk. 
Mulder stares at the W.M.M., at his cold-blooded expression. 
MULDER Let me out. Stop the car. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN (motioning) Driver. 
Mulder reaching to this as the limo pulls to a stop. Trying the door, but the door is locked. When he turns back to the W.M.M. he has produced a handgun, which is now pointing at Mulder. Laid casually across a folded arm. Mulder reacts on seeing it. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN The men I work with will stop at nothing to clear the way for what they believe is their stake in the inevitable future. I was ordered to kill Kurtzweil. A necessary action to protect my grandchildren's lives. (beat) I might just as easily kill you. 
Mulder is recoiling as he says this. Then, without hesitation in one quick move, he SHOOTS the Driver in the head. 
The blood spattering on the front windshield -- and on Mulder who has barely had a chance to react. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN Trust no one, Mr. Mulder. 
Mulder looks at The Well-Manicured Man, expecting to be next. And for a moment, we do too. But the W.M.M. simply opens the door and steps out of the car. Holding the door open for Mulder who is still frozen by the actions that went just before. 
EXT. DESOLATE D.C. STREET - NIGHT 
Mulder steps out of the car, holding the felt envelope. The Well-Manicured Man stands with a sober, intense look. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN (with quiet force) You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project. 
MULDER How? 
WELL-MANICURED MAN The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years. (beat) Or it may not. 
MULDER What alien environment? 
WELL-MANICURED MAN Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future. 
MULDER What about you? 
WELL-MANICURED MAN My life is over. (beat) Go. 
Mulder stands speechless for a moment. Until the W.M.M. points the weapon he's still holding at him. 
WELL-MANICURED MAN Go now! 
And Mulder does. Moving away from the car, looking back over his shoulder. As the Well-Manicured Man gets back into the limousine, closes the door. A moment later... THE CAR EXPLODES INTO FLAMES, knocking Mulder to the ground. 
ANGLE ON MULDER 
The felt envelope has been jarred from his grasp. Its contents loosed from inside: a piece of paper with COORDINATES on it and an AMPULE and SYRINGE. 
Mulder gets up, looks back. Then he picks up the envelope and its contents -- and begins to run. Running as fast as he can go. Until, far down the block, he disappears. 
As the SCREEN DISSOLVES TO WHITENESS -- under which we hear an ominous low end Dolby THX Big Screen rumble. The same sound that opened our story. 
Then there is movement, as the curvilinear line of a horizon becomes visible, bi-secting the screen between the white of the earth and the white of the sky. We are: 
EXT. POLE OF INACCESSIBILITY - ANTARCTICA 
Across the expanse of whiteness, a DARK IMAGE appears on the long flat horizon. Moving toward us. As a LEGEND appears, to establish. 
CLOSER ON A SNOW TRACTOR 
Crawling across the harsh frozen land like a domed insect. 
INT. SNOW TRACTOR 
Agent Mulder sits behind the controls of the enclosed cabin, several days growth on his face. Dressed in thick, bundled outerwear. He maneuvers the vehicle to a stop. Reaching for a handheld GPS monitor to check his position. Catching his breath for a moment -- all movement is exertion in this climate. Mulder stares hard out the front window, the wipers beating time, but there is nothing out there but whiteness. He wipes the fog from a side window with his gloved hand, seeing nothing but more whiteness. Checking the GPS device again, then reaching for the door latch. 
RESUME WIDE EXTERIOR 
Agent Mulder exits the vehicle, hopping down onto the snowscape crust. Setting out on foot with the GPS device held before him. In this forbidding environment he might as well be taking a space walk -- without the security of a lifeline. Which is the impression we get as his tiny figure trudges across the ice, increasing the distance between himself and the snow tractor. 
MOVING WITH MULDER 
Up a gentle grade, the snow tractor now behind him. Moving into tight f.g. where he stops, seeing something now which allows him to pocket the GPS device. Dropping instinctively to his knees, so as to avoid being seen by: 
MULDER'S POV 
VARIOUS SHOTS of rivulets of water forming on the icy liths that encase the bodies. The water from them seeping onto the circular central floor. The condensing mist thick and swirling. 
CLOSE ON PODS 
Where the body it houses seems to move. Though AS CAMERA PUSHES IN we see that it is the creature inside this body moving, as if the heat and the defrosting are bringing the embryos to life. 
INT. UPPER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE DOWN CORRIDOR 
Scully's head pokes through now, as she's pushed through the opening that Mulder used earlier to get into the vaulted arena. Pushed in fits and starts until she's all the way through. Mulder now straining and squeezing to do the same on his own. 
The corridor is filled with heavy condensed mist now as Mulder finally slips out of the low passageway, trying to get his bearing now as he huddles low over Scully. Turning his attention to her as she COUGHS HOARSELY -- in some kind of acute spasm of pain -- but alive. 
MULDER We've got to keep moving. 
SCULLY (weakly) Where are we? 
MULDER You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa. 
Scully is struggling now as Mulder tries to pull her to her feet again. In real physical pain. 
SCULLY I can't... 
Scully can't finish speaking, her voice becoming a hoarse cough. 
SCULLY (barely a whisper) I can't go any farther. 
MULDER Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully. 
Mulder hauling Scully up off the floor AWAY FROM CAMERA now. 
NEW ANGLE ON RIBBED CORRIDOR 
CAMERA MOVING THROUGH SPACE in the empty corridor, moving at a speed equal to Mulder and Scully's as they round the semi-circular ribbed corridor to meet us. Coming out of the mist, Scully back in the fireman's carry. Approaching the place where Mulder slipped down into the corridor. 
Mulder stopping and seeing: 
THE BODY IN THE MELTING ICE LITH 
As it too moves, the embryonic creature inside it turning slightly, as if coming awake. 
REVERSE ON MULDER 
Reacting to this -- and then to Scully who suddenly starts GASPING FOR BREATH. 
Falling now from Mulder's grasps as her legs buckle and she goes down. 
LOW ANGLE ON SCULLY 
Her face is going red, straining for air. Her eyes rolling, seeking relief. As Mulder drops down beside her. 
MULDER Shit -- 
But she is unable to answer. Mulder hastening to unzip her/his jacket. To get to her neck and find a pulse. 
MULDER Scully -- 
Mulder cannot find a pulse. Scully straining harder now as Mulder reaches his fingers into her mouth, clearing her passageway. Moving on top of her now, and pumping forcefully on her chest -- trying to get air into her. One - two - three. 
And putting his mouth down to hers (FINALLY!), breathing his life into her. Pulling away from her to see that he is unsuccessful at this -- that Scully is continuing to strain. Pumping her chest again -- 
MULDER You're not dying on me now -- godammit godammit godammit -- 
As he pumps her chest. Placing his mouth over hers again and BREATH - BREATH -- BREATH. 
Lifting his mouth from hers, feeling for a pulse again, putting his eat down to her mouth, praying he'll feel the breeze of a breath. Nothing. While: 
ANGLE OVER HIM TO THE CREATURE IN THE ICY POD 
As it moves again, MORE VIOLENTLY NOW. As the ice around it continues to melt and fissure. 
RESUME MULDER 
His hands going to a pocket on the inside of the jacket Scully is wearing -- his jacket -- finding again the syringe that he used on Scully. It is still partially full of vaccine. Mulder finding this, getting ready to use it when -- 
-- Scully's body suddenly comes back to life beneath him. Labored breaths which turn into a coughing spasm. Mulder breaths relievedly for a moment, watching Scully coughing, coming back to life. Her eyes trying to focus on him, finding him. Seeing his labored relief. The panic melting away. 
SCULLY (weakly, pained whisper) Mulder... 
She wants to tell him something. He leans down next to her. 
SCULLY (continued weak) Had you big time. 
Mulder has but a moment to savor this weary victory though when he REACTS to something, that causes him to WHIP HIS HEAD AROUND. 
MULDER'S POV DOWN RIBBED CORRIDOR 
Through the condensed mist he can see CREATURES BEGINNING TO HATCH, sprouting from the melted ice-encased bodies they have gestated in. Their THREE FINGERED HANDS beating at the soft ice. Their powerful feet kicking at it, too. 
WIDE ON SCENE 
Mulder and Scully running AT CAMERA just ahead of the collapsing center. The mass of ice around them beginning to break up. Steam vents erupting instantaneously everywhere. 
CUT TO: 
HIGH ANGLE ON SCENE 
A black dome is becoming visible through the giant circle of steam, in the ever-widening center hole that Mulder and Scully are running from. Which is chasing them to the edge of the radius. 
CUT TO: 
ANGLE FOLLOWING MULDER AND SCULLY 
As Mulder struggles to pull Scully fast enough to outrace the icy debris that is tumbling away just behind them. Large chunks falling and bouncing off the superheated surface below, blown back up like water being dropped onto a hot skillet. 
CUT TO: 
EXTREMELY HIGH AND WIDE 
The Agents mere specks fleeing the circle of churning ice and steam. As it cascades away in three hundred and sixty degrees. From here the deafening sound if absorbed into the vastness, tricking us of the reality of the massive movement of frozen material down below. 
CUT TO: 
ANGLE LEADING MULDER AND SCULLY 
As Scully loses her footing, falling to the ground. Mulder dragging her back up to her feet, though, maintaining forward momentum. While behind them the thundering force of the superheated melting snow and ice is moving in on them. 
And then suddenly -- MULDER AND SCULLY are gone! 
The radial edge of the falling snow continuing only a few feet beyond where they disappeared. The violent upheaval of snow abating but slightly. Beat, beat... 
THEN THE AGENTS APPEAR AGAIN. Thrust upward by a RISING BLACK PRECIPICE which catapults them off its leading edge. As they fall the distance to the sheet of ice below. 
CUT TO: 
LOW ANGLE ON ICE SHEET 
Where the Agents hit hard on the ice sheet. The rain of ice chunks pounding all around them. As the monolithic wall of the craft continues to rise. 
Mulder trying to get to Scully in this hail of debris which he shields his face from. 
WIDE ON LEADING EDGE 
Rising faster now out of the earth as it begins to increasingly shed and break free of the frozen weight it carried. Until the bottom of the edge of the wall appears, lifting clear of the ice sheet and the crater that held it. 
CUT TO: 
EXTREME HIGH WIDE ANGLE ON SPACE SHIP 
Where now we see the scope and shape of the ship, which is breathtaking. The domed center sloping off to a gentle gradient, which is the surface that Mulder and Scully were running on. The ship is now slowly rotating as it moves upward in a gently rising hover. 
Mulder and Scully are on the ice sheet below. 
RESUME MULDER AND SCULLY 
Scully face down on the ice. Mulder lifting his head when THE HEAVY SHADOW of the ship comes over them. Looking up from this position to see: 
THE SPACE SHIP 
Moving slowly, laterally just overhead. Thunderously rumbling. The dark detail of its underside visible in this angle. As it continues to rise, the shadow passing over Mulder and Scully. 
CUT TO: 
NEW ANGLE OVER MULDER AND SCULLY 
Scully is still face down on the ice, as Mulder watches the ship's shadow cast over Mulder's SnowCat which is still parked in the distance. Moving up and off. 
The ship continues up into the Antarctic sky where it rises toward the sky where it begins to get WHITEHOT. Transforming itself into pure energy. It is visible for several moments during transformation. Then it disappears completely. As it does the RUMBLE, which dopplers across the white, barren landscape. Then it is gone. 
MULDER 
Watches this then lays his head down on Scully's back. He is spent, at the brink of complete exhaustion. His whole body heaving. But now starting to shiver, and to lose consciousness. 
Scully's body is motionless beneath him, for a moment we might believe that this is the way it might end. Out here on the ice with Mulder and Scully freezing to death. A chill wind blows off the Antarctic plain, the same LOW RUMBLE, the only taint of silence in vastness of this literal end of the world. 
Then Scully coughs -- the same hoarse cough. She's alive. Struggling to consciousness. Her head lifting slightly, TURNING TO CAMERA. Her eyes blink open and she coughs again. Feeling Mulder's weight on top of her, unaware of his condition or even where she is. 
SCULLY (weakly) Mulder... 
There is no answer. Scully struggling to pull herself out from under the weight of his body. Rolling over so that her face is opposite Mulder's now. Seeing that he has lost consciousness. Finding the strength to roll him over, so that she can cradle him and warm him. 
HIGH WIDE ANGLE ON THIS SCENE 
With the Snowcat a short distance away, Mulder and Scully in each others arms. The way it should end. 
FADE TO BLACK

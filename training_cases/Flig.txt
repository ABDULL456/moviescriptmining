CHYRON -- ATLANTA 6:12 AM 
EXT. SOMEWHAT SEEDY TWO-STORY HOTEL IN ATLANTA -- PRE-DAWN 
It's still more night than day as we look down on the HOTEL ATLANTA. The lit sign for the HOTEL ATLANTA may be the only source of light as we hear a metallic rattle. 
EXT. HOTEL ATLANTA -- SECOND FLOOR -- PRE-DAWN 
We follow the metallic rattle to a door. The rattling stops and we watch the knob slowly turn. 
Tight on a feminine arm with a tattoo that announces "hope." We pull back to find that both arms are employed in the pulling of what looks like a large suitcase. 
NICOLE MAGGEN, a beautiful but tired woman, finishes pulling the suitcase that we now surmise to be a folded-up massage table out of the motel room. With her bra in one hand and the rickety table resting against the wall of the exterior 2nd floor hallway of the motel, she assesses her situation. 
She digs in her purse, lights a cigarette and continues digging in her purse. She finds a beat-up candy tin. She opens it and quickly sorts through a collection of burnt foils, heroin foils, looking for residue. Nothing. 
She now finds and holds up the 100 bucks she just made. She flips open her cheap phone and makes a call...she thinks better of it and hangs up. 
EXT. HOTEL ATLANTA -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER 
NICOLE forces the clumsy table into the hatchback of a 1988 Toyota Tercel and slams it shut. 
INT. 1988 TOYOTA TERCEL -- PARKING LOT -- SAME TIME 
We hear the electronic ring of her cheap cell phone on "speaker phone" mode. The phone rests on the passenger seat. We pull up to find NICOLE slumped with her head resting on the steering wheel. She is exhausted and irritated... 
NICOLE (as the phone rings) Don't pick up...don't pick up... don't pick up... 
A MAN answers with music in the background..."Yo.." NICOLE quickly picks up the phone. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) It's Nic, do you have any? Good morning to you too. You're what? Well, where are you guys shooting today? Where? Text me the address. You have some...Okay. 
She hangs up the phone and catching herself in the rearview she tries to smile. 
CHYRON -- ORLANDO 7:14 AM 
EXT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES - HOTEL -- ORLANDO -- MORNING 
The sun would be rising if the sky wasn't swirling with grey clouds. We see the American Suites Hotel and recognize it as a decent commuters' hotel near the airport in Orlando. The sound of a clock radio breaks the calm of our picture. 
INT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES - HOTEL -- ORLANDO -- MORNING 
Through the clock radio we loudly hear two morning drive-time radio personalities spewing nonsensical patter... 
An attractive YOUNG WOMAN wrestles free of the covers and gets out of bed. She crosses naked through the room as a cell phone starts ringing. 
Back to the bed as WHIP WHITAKER rises into frame and inhabits the room like a lazy ape at the zoo. WHIP wears his 40 some years of life experience like a medal. Smoke hangs in the air and empty beers, a pint of vodka and two empty carafes of cheap hotel wine clutter the table as WHIP snatches up his phone and answers... 
VOICE For the love of Christ! Look...just hold...HOLD ON. 
He aggressively drains the last four inches of beer from a clear bottle and cracks the last fresh one that bobs in the hotel ice bucket. 
The naked, YOUNG WOMAN bends over to pick up her clothes. 
We witness her ass as a tanned glass vase with a perfect crack down the middle. Whip smiles, taking it all in... 
WHIP (into the phone) I've been up since the crack 'a dawn. What check? Tuition? How much does it cost to go there? 
The YOUNG WOMAN has re-lit the last half of a joint and is puffing it to life as WHIP is beckoning with his large hands. 
The YOUNG WOMAN, looking more like a stripper by the second, hands the joint to WHIP who takes a masterful drag. WHIP shakes his head in violent disapproval to what he hears on the phone. He exhales in anger as he shouts into the phone. 
WHIP (CONT'D) NO! NO! NO! You decided he needed private school...lemme talk to Knuckles. He's not? Tell'em the phone works both ways. Oh he's my son because you need a tuition check...that's great Deana. I'm glad you tracked me down in Orlando at 7 in the fucking morning to shake me down for money. Does he even like the fucking school? No I've never seen it. Yeah I wonder why not too. I gotta 9 o'clock flight, sit tight 'till I get back to Atlanta. How am I a liar? What? No, I'll call you. 
WHIP hangs up and continues to make quick work of the last beer as he stares through his thoughts and out the window. 
YOUNG WOMAN Was that your wife? 
WHIP That was my ex-wife. But you Trina, you could be my second or third wife if you'd just C'mere. 
The YOUNG WOMAN we now know as TRINA smiles seductively... 
TRINA Whip, don't even joke about that. Our flight's at 9, let's hit it. 
TRINA is still naked but she holds a navy blue skirt and a white blouse as she hands WHIP his pants. WHIP can't help but pat that perfect ass as TRINA tries to skip away. 
ON THE RADIO We hear the opening bars of a familiar rock anthem...JOE COCKER's "I'm Feeling Alright" 
WHIP Yeah, I'm feelin' a little light- headed. I shoulda ate somethin'. 
WHIP leans over the motel table, picks up a soda straw that's been cut in half. He efficiently sniffs up a line of coke. 
INT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES HOTEL-ORLANDO-HALLWAY-MORNING 
WHIP wears his pilot Blues and carries his hat as he strides confidently down the hallway. JOE COCKER continues to wail, perfectly narrating the hero's swagger that WHIP maintains while passing bad light fixtures and ornate wall paper. 
EXT. AIRPORT SOUTHJET TARMAC - AIRPLANE - MORNING RAINING 
WHIP leans against the landing gear of the JACKSON-RIDGEFIELD 88 PASSENGER JET -- He takes a swig from a small bottle of mouthwash -- gargles, then spits the green foam on the tarmac. WHIP wipes fatigue from his face as he stashes the mouthwash in his pocket, then quickly completes his visual walk around. He looks at the sky again as he steps on to the jet way ladder. His foot slips, sending his shoe SPLASHING in to a puddle. 
WHIP Son of a bitch! 
Whip shakes the rain out of his shoe as he continues up the stairs. 
KIP Nicole, this is Tiki Pot. He's my partner in this new series, he knows a lot about porn. 
NICOLE Kip I need 2 grams of "h." 
KIP Tiki and I are trying to put the narrative back in porn. Our Desdemona hasn't shown yet. (a great idea hatches...) You should play Desdemona. FUCK YEAH! You got that fair skin. 
KIP is flirting, seeing if she'll consider it... 
NICOLE Desdemona? What the fuck? 
TIKI does a line and comes up babbling. 
TIKI POT She do anal, two thousand, one hour. 
NICOLE I don't do porn, Kip. Just lemme see the "h." 
KIP Just listen, we're doing an Othello theme where the Moor finds you in bed with your nurse and- 
NICOLE He fucks me in the ass? 
KIP Well...yeah. We're giving a whole new meaning to the "beast with two backs." That's actually a title we're toying with...'beast with two backs' or Hole-thelo or Butt Hole- thelo...would you be up for it? 
TIKI POT College kid, very clean...BRETT?! 
A tall thin kid joins them. He wears a Moorish Headdress and has a bath towel wrapped around his waist. 
TIKI POT (CONT'D) Show her the pipe- 
BRETT drops the towel... 
NICOLE Fuck you Tiki, you put that in your ass and call me in the morning. Kip, have I ever done that shit for you? Never. Asshole. 
NICOLE walks away. KIP follows her...at the door. 
KIP Nic...sorry, we're tweaked, okay baby girl. Hey, c'mon you wanna stay and shoot some stills for me, you're pics are awesome. And what's going on with you? You were clean for a while and... (she begins to cry) Sweetheart, don't cry. 
NICOLE I just need a little to smoke. (flashes the cash) I've got 100. 
KIP pulls a small tin foil square from his vest pocket. 
KIP No, keep your money, okay? But, Nicole, this is the Taliban baby, very big time. It will take you down. 
NICOLE I can handle it. 
KIP (CONT'D) Don't shoot this shit, it is way too heavy. 
NICOLE I'm just gonna smoke it. I haven't done needles in weeks. 
KIP Okay, no needles and take a little coke and if you start going down just whiff a little. Okay? I wanna see you... 
KIP hands her a tiny baggy of coke. He kisses her cheek. 
CUT TO: 
INT. COCKPIT -- MORNING 
Out the window...nothing...the rain pounds. WHIP leans close to the windshield in an attempt to improve his view. 
EVANS reaches down and throws a switch. The windshield wipers go on. We can now see very clearly the path of lights the plane is to follow. WHIP looks to EVANS, smiles with stoned eyes. 
WHIP Thanks junior. 
EVANS looks out at the rain... 
EVANS Looks pretty ugly, sir. 
WHIP A little rain never hurt anybody. We're not made of sugar. What's the RVR? 
EVANS Half a mile. Right at minimums. Wind's gusting to 29. 30 is our crosswind max. 
WHIP I know what our crosswind max is. Tellem were good to go at the end. 
EVANS just stares at WHIP. 
GROUND CONTROL (ON RADIO) SouthJet 227, say intentions. 
WHIP looks right at EVANS. EVANS keys the radio. 
EVANS Orlando ground. SouthJet 227 will be ready to go at the end. 
WHIP stares forward, not looking at EVANS. 
INT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY 
Nervous passengers stare out the windows as the JR-88 lumbers along the tarmac, headed for the runway. 
We follow TRINA whose ass looks as good in a tight navy skirt as it does split bare with orange fluorescence. MARGARET speaks into the PA mic. 
MARGARET Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the seat-belt sign. Please be sure your seat-belts are securely fastened, and all carry-on items are safely stored in the over- head bin, or under the seat in front of you. Also, all personal electronic devices must be switched off, at this time. Today's flight time to Atlanta should be 52 minutes. Flight attendants please take your seats. 
16 TRINA straps into her jump-seat. 16 
INT. COCKPIT -- MORNING -- POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD 
Heavy rain lashes the nose of the plane. Lightning FLASHES. We watch the plane steer on to the GLOWING center-line. 
INT. COCKPIT 
Whip inhales his coffee and readies himself for take-off. EVANS tries to relax, continuing with the checklist. 
EVANS (reading the check-list) Elevator trim - set. Flaps, One, two, three - set. Radios - set. 
The plane rocks and shutters. WHIP seems oblivious as he continues to serenade Evans. 
WHIP (SINGING) Feelin' alright - Not feelin' too good myself - Feelin' alright - Not feelin' too good myself... 
WHIP is interrupted by Air Traffic Control. 
ATC (ON RADIO) SouthJet 227...Be advised there is a large convective cell four miles at your 11 o'clock. And another cell, 2 o'clock, 10 miles. Both moving rapidly. 
EVANS Copy, Center. (TO WHIP) Did you get that? 
WHIP Gottit Skippy. I'm just tryin' to get birdie here outta this wind bowl...What did they clear us to? 
EVANS We're cleared to Flight Level one- eight-thousand. 
THE PLANE TAKES ANOTHER VIOLENT DIP 
EVANS' headset flies off. His tie and all the loose equipment and coffee cups are thrown to the ground. 
WHIP Goddamnit! Enough of this shit! 
WHIP pushes the yoke forward. The plane pitches downward. 
EVANS What are you doing!? 
WHIP Leveling off. 
EVANS What!? 
WHIP points to the MFD screen. 
WHIP See that sliver of blue sitting between those two ugly bastards? 
C.U. MFD screen: A narrow line of blue is visible between the two monstrous convective cells. 
WHIP (CONT'D) That's a little pocket of smooth air squatting right over Lake Kissimmee... 
EVANS nervously squints at the screen. 
WHIP (CONT'D) And we're gonna thread that fucking needle. Turn me thirty degrees right! 
EVANS jumps on the radio. 
EVANS (into his mic) Center. This is SouthJet 227, We need to divert 30 degrees right... 
WHIP For weather. 
EVANS (into his mic) ...for weather. 
ATC SouthJet 227, this is Jacksonville Center. 30 Degrees, right, approved. Report back on course. 
EVANS Report back on course. 
WHIP banks the plane to the right. 
Suddenly -- the plane falls 200 feet in 2 seconds. 
A huge air pocket pulls the rug out from under the JR-88. From the cockpit we can hear the passengers scream. EVANS holds on to his headset. 
EVANS (CONT'D) Oh, Lord! 
WHIP He can't help you now, brother. 
WHIP remains cool as he rides more bad air. The plane now bounces rapidly over a non-stop succession of speed bumps. 
INT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY 
The passengers clutch each other as they rattle like bobble head dolls; it's getting worse. 
INT. COCKPIT - DAY 
WHIP pushes the throttle and the 17-year-old Jackson- Ridgefield JR-88 accelerates directly into a huge black cloud. He begins to dip the nose level to the ground. 
EVANS Why are you leveling off, sir? 
WHIP I'd like to spend less time in this shitty air, Kenny. Is that alright with you? 
WHIP pushes the 17-year-old Jackson-Ridgefield JR-88 directly into a huge black cloud. He begins to dip the nose towards the ground. 
EVANS We're approaching maximum airspeed! 
WHIP Fucking right! I'm gonna need some speed to punch through this crap. 
INT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY 
The passengers howl in fear as the plane pitches forward. 
INT. COCKPIT - DAY 
EVANS calls out to WHIP... 
EVANS You're over-speeding! 
WHIP Not yet!! 
The AIRSPEED INDICATOR moves from GREEN right up to the YELLOW line. 
WHIP banks the plane steeply to the right. From the cabin we HEAR the passengers SCREAM! 
Now ATC comes on the radio... 
ATC (ON RADIO) Uh, SouthJet 227, this is Jacksonville Center. Say altitude. 
NICOLE kicks the door shut and locks it, escaping FRAN who calls through the door. 
FRAN (O.S.) Tricky tricky, girl. Alright, so you shower up and come down. For real. We don't gotta talk about the check. Hang out a lil bit... 
NICOLE puts her camera down gently on the table. 
NICOLE (SOTTO) In your fucking dreams. 
She now flings her purse on the ground in frustration...the contents spill on to the carpet. Amidst the flotsam we focus on yet another candy tin that springs open. NICOLE fixes her stare at the hypodermic needle resting inside. 
INT. CABIN - GALLEY - DAY 
WHIP exits the lavatory drying his hands with a towel. He looks down the aisle to see TRINA far down the cabin. TRINA sees WHIP, comes back up the aisle and stands with her back to him watching the passengers. 
WHIP opens a bottle of orange juice and takes a big swig. He then pours half of it in the sink. WHIP places the open juice bottle on the liquor cart, reaches up, and grabs the cabin mic to address the passengers. 
WHIP Folks, this is Captain Whitaker. If you look up, I'm here in the galley. I will wave to you. 
WHIP steps into the aisle so the passengers can see him. WHIP waves with a calm smile that would put anyone at ease. 
WHIP (CONT'D) Good Morning. I apologize for the bumps, but Florida just doesn't seem to like us Georgians. Must be the beatin' the Bulldogs put on the Gators last fall. 
Titters of laughter from the passengers as WHIP moves the half step he needs to put himself behind the liquor cart. 
WHIP (CONT'D) Stretch out and relax. The air might stay a little cranky so I'm gonna ask that you sit tight if you can, with your seat belts fastened. 
We now watch from behind WHIP as his free hand reaches into the top drawer of the liquor cart and pulls three small vodka bottles out. 
WHIP (CONT'D) We won't have beverage service but the girls will walk through with water and snacks and I'll have you in Atlanta in about 40 minutes. Thank you. 
WHIP puts the mic to its hook. Alone in the galley and out of view, he quickly empties the vodkas into the orange juice bottle and replaces the cap. Whip shakes the juice as he tosses the little empties into the galley trash. Whip takes a healthy pull from the spiked juice, downing nearly half. 
WHIP knocks on the cockpit door. MARGARET emerges and WHIP disappears in to the cockpit. 
INT. NICOLE'S APARTMENT -- ATLANTA -- DAY 
Framed photos on a bureau show: Christmas around the tree with Mom (30) and Dad (33) and a girl who's 8 and a boy who's 5. (In the reflection of this photo we see a flame cooking heroin in a spoon.) 
Another photo depicts an 8 year-old girl's birthday party. (In the reflection of this photo see wee Nicole tying off.) 
A last photo shows NICOLE (30)and her mom (54). They are both wearing kerchiefs. We can see that her mom is gaunt and has no hair under her kerchief. (In the reflection of this photo we see the needle injected into her arm.) 
A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE is placed in front of that picture. Next to the photos is a small CD station that NICOLE taps to life and turns up. The opening bars of Michael Fitzpatrick's "Medication" begin to play. 
We pull wide to see NICOLE pull the bra from her arm that she used to tie off with. Her face is pure happiness. 
Clothes and a peach crate filled with camera equipment join a suitcase on its side that acts as a coffee table. NICOLE picks up her camera and admires it before putting it down. 
She picks up the cigarette she had staged pre dope fix and reaches for the lighter. She laughs and hums, pulls out gum, a brush...She's holding the brush when the first heavy wave of narcotic death washes over her. She leans back and uses the wall for support. "Medication" is hitting its chorus... 
NICOLE Oh man... 
She puts her arms out at her sides, euphoria. A slow, sloppy smile breaks across her face. She exhales slowly. She reaches for the now burning cigarette when the second wave of heavy drugs hits. NICOLE looks up with fear. 
NICOLE (cont'd) (CONT'D) Oh no, oh no, oh no... 
She reaches for the little bag of coke that KIP gave her. Next she grabs her phone, flipping it open. As she tries to dial it, she crumbles to her knees. NICOLE somewhat controls her fall to the ground, but her eyes are fading. The little bag of coke falls from her fingers. 
There's no way to stem the tide of the oncoming overdose. NICOLE's arms stretch out in a frozen reach as her body sinks to the floor. On her back like a girl making angels in the snow as her eyelids flutter, she slips away. 
We hear a pounding on the door. FRAN is on the other side... 
FRAN (O.S.) Open up, Nicole! I can smell that shit cooking! Open Up! Nicole. Nicole! 
INT. COCKPIT - DAY 
WHIP is now passed out in the seat next to EVANS. He has two approach plates (charts) folded and tucked between his sunglasses and eyes, creating a makeshift sleeping mask. His lower jaw hangs open as his head bobs in deep sleep. 
Margaret leans in through the cockpit door talking to Evans. 
MARGARET How long has Sleeping Beauty been out? 
EVANS maintains a military posture as he monitors the plane's progress. The flight is smooth and the sky appears clear. 
EVANS (looks at his watch) 26 minutes. We're going to start descending any second now. 
MARGARET Well, I guess you'll need to wake... 
The radio interrupts... 
ATC SouthJet 227, Atlanta Center. Descend and maintain Flight Level 30 thousand. 
EVANS Descend and maintain 30 thousand. 
Evans dials 30,000 into the auto-pilot, but just as he rolls the thumb switch to the "Descend" position... 
BANG! THE PLANE SUDDENLY PITCHES SIDEWAYS 
Instantly the autopilot's Shut-Off SOUNDS. 
WHIP jolts awake and pushes up his sleeping "shades." 
WHIP The fuck was that? 
Evans grabs his yoke and pulls. 
EVANS The stabilizer feels really stiff. 
WHIP Don't force it. 
EVANS does, we HEAR a big mechanical SNAP. 
WHIP (KEYS MIC) 260...we'll do our best. (TO EVANS) It's getting away from me! I can't hold...dump the flaps! 
EVANS We're still fast. 
The yoke is ripping away from Whip's hands. 
WHIP DO IT! 30 percent! 
Evans dumps in the flaps. The JR-88 slows dramatically and balloons up. 
WHIP (CONT'D) That bought us a little time. We need to revert to manual control. Your side first, pul... 
Whip is interrupted by the radio. 
ATC (ON RADIO) SouthJet 227, Atlanta. Fuel dump is approved. 
WHIP (KEYS MIC) Thank you. 
Evans is confused and panicked, he throws his hands up. 
WHIP (CONT'D) Evans, look at me! Manual Reversion. Red lever, on the floor, far side of the console. 
Evans sees it. 
EVANS I got it. 
WHIP Pull it up, turn it clockwise, push it back down. 
Evans does exactly that, then pulls back on his yoke -- nothing! 
EVANS Nothing! No control! 
WHIP Goddamn it!! 
Once again, the plane pitches into a dive. Whip strains to hold on. 
WHIP (CONT'D) I can't let go! Can you reach mine? 
Evans strains to reach Whip's Reversion Pull-Handle -- but can't. 
EVANS I can't reach it. 
Evans moves to release his harness, but Whip stops him. 
WHIP No! Don't! Stay strapped in! (calls over his shoulder) Margaret! Margaret! 
Margaret tumbles into the cockpit, catching herself on Whip's chair. She's crying. 
MARGARET Oh God, Whip. What's happening?! 
WHIP Get strapped into the jump-seat. I need your help. 
Margaret opens the jump-seat and starts to pull on her harness. Throughout the scene she is struggling with her harness. 
WHIP (CONT'D) Margaret, see that red lever on the floor next to my chair? The one that says, Manual Control? 
MARGARET Yes. 
WHIP On the count of three you pull it up, turn it clockwise, then push it back down. OK? You ready? 
With tears streaming down her cheeks, she gives Whip a brave nod. 
WHIP (CONT'D) Here we go. One, two... 
Whip releases back pressure from his yoke, pushing it forward -- the plane noses downward 20 degrees! 
WHIP (CONT'D) ...three! 
MORE TERRIFIED SHRIEKS come from the back. Margaret quickly disengages then re-engages the large red handle. 
Whip pulls back on his yoke. The plane pitches up. 
WHIP (CONT'D) Ok. OK. We got something. It's still stiff as hell. Evans, put in some power! 
Evans pushes up the throttles. Whip gingerly applies pressure to his stick. His face fills with worry. 
WHIP (CONT'D) I don't know. It feels like the son of a bitch wants to nose over. 
Then suddenly... WHAP! Whip's yoke flies out of his hands and SLAMS forward! 
The plane banks right and drops! Margaret SCREAMS! 
WHIP (CONT'D) SHIT! POWER BACK! (he pulls back the power) I CAN'T FUCKING BELIEVE THIS! 
EVANS OH NO! 
Now, ATC comes on the radio... 
ATC SouthJet 227, Hartsfield-Jackson is eleven o'clock and niner miles. I see you below 10,000. How are you doing? 
WHIP (keys his mic) Not good. You got anything closer? We're in a rapid dive here... 
ATC Roger, SouthJet 227. Uh...Clayton County is 2 miles at your 4 o'clock. 
WHIP Negative. We're too high...we can't pitch for glide. We have no stabilizer control. 
ATC Copy, SouthJet 227. 
The plane continues to drop, increasing its nose-down attitude and speed. 
WHIP pushes both of his feet forward, stretching his body to get leverage as we can see him pulling on the yoke, trying to get the plane out of the dive it's in. 
WHIP's eyes open to see the halogen overhead lights of a hospital room. He turns his head slightly to see the flicker of a TV with no sound. 
TELEVISION -- NEWS - NO SOUND -- GRAINY CELL PHONE FOOTAGE 
A news show runs a loop of eye witness cell phone footage of the plane turning over and crashing belly down. 
A MAN who has been watching the TV turns to see that WHIP is awake. The MAN turns off the TV, gets up and approaches WHIP's bedside. WHIP knows him. 
WHIP Charlie Anderson. 
CHARLIE ANDERSON is a late 50's former military pilot who carries that familiar air of Texas comfort and entitlement. 
CHARLIE How you feelin' Whip? Initial reports look like you pulled some move up there, kid. You saved a lot of lives. 
WHIP is moved by the first realization of survival. 
WHIP How many? 
CHARLIE moves close to deliver the news. 
CHARLIE 102 souls on board including the flight crew, and 96 of them survived the crash. Six people died. 2 crew, 4 passengers. 
WHIP 4 passengers. Are the rest badly hurt? Who'd we lose on the crew? 
A NURSE enters the room. CHARLIE nods to her. 
CHARLIE Listen, protocol is the NTSB has to make the first contact with you and the agent is here. Let me go get him. 
CHARLIE ducks out of the room. WHIP is alone and still getting his bearings. He goes to scratch his head and catches sight of his left hand. It's swollen and sore --his wrist is bandaged with a splint-brace. He now looks at both of his hands in wonder. 
WHIP hears a muffled conversation that gets clearer as do the images of MANY PEOPLE entering the room. A POLICE OFFICER accompanies a DOCTOR and TWO NTSB AGENTS. 
An NTSB AGENT holds a small voice recorder towards WHIP. 
NTSB OFFICER #1 Captain William Whitaker? Nod if you can hear me and understand me. (WHIP NODS) I'm Craig Matson from the NTSB and I'm required as the lead on the Go Team to make an initial contact with you after a major incident like the one you had today. 
WHIP nods as his senses are getting sharper. 
NTSB OFFICER #1 (CONT'D) You are in a hospital in South Atlanta. Are you aware that you were piloting a plane that went down? (WHIP NODS) I have a doctor here who can explain your medical situation. 
WHIP offers a "thumbs up" gesture. The DOCTOR steps in. 
DOCTOR I'm Doctor Kenan and the good news is that you are in good condition. You did suffer a concussion which is the reason you have a bit of blurred vision and a headache. You have numerous lacerations around your left eye. We're going to leave the patch on for a few days as a precaution. But it seems your eye is OK. MRI's show strained tendons in your left knee and ankle but you didn't break any bones. 
You have some deep bruising in your left thigh and you have a few torn ligaments in your left wrist. Nothing serious. So as soon as we clear you from the concussion, and you feel well enough -- you can go home. That could be a day, could be 3 days. Okay? 
WHIP quietly nods. The DOCTOR leaves and WHIP begins to study his body. His left leg is wrapped, his left wrist has a splint-brace -- 
NTSB OFFICER #1 I won't ask too much of you tonight, but as I said, the NTSB is required to make initial contact. How much do you remember about the flight? 
WHIP looks at the NTSB OFFICER and slowly speaks. 
WHIP I remember everything until the crash. 
WHIP's voice is failing him as his throat is sore and dry. 
NTSB OFFICER #1 Okay Mr. Whitaker, that's fine. I am required to inform you that this incident did result in the loss of life. (checks an index card) The most current information states that of the 102 souls on board we lost 6. 2 crew members and 4 passengers. 59 people were treated and released. 37 people remain in the hospital and 3 of those cases are listed as critical. 
WHIP Who on the crew died? 
NTSB OFFICER #1 Two flight attendants; (checks a note card) Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez 
WHIP tries to exhale as the loss of TRINA sinks in. 
NTSB OFFCIER #1 The rep from your Pilot's Union, Mr. Anderson, will act as our contact for you. It's important to follow your Union's guidance on press and media. The pilot's union works closely with the NTSB. So, I'm gonna head out. Good luck Mr. Whitaker. 
WHIP nods as the NTSB OFFICER leaves with the police and other officials in tow. CHARLIE returns to WHIP's side. 
WHIP I knew Trina Marquez. We spent some time together. 
CHARLIE Apparently she wasn't strapped in. A survivor reported that she was assisting a kid. 
CHARLIE tries to put a reassuring hand on WHIP's shoulder. 
WHIP How's Margaret Thomason? 
CHARLIE (checks his notes) Broken collar bone, cuts, banged up, but she's okay. She's here too. Ken Evans your copilot took a bad shot to the head. They're keepin' him in a coma to let the brain swelling go down. He's listed as critical, but we feel good about him. He's gonna be okay. 
WHIP lets that information land as his head is swirling. 
WHIP Charlie, why are you here? 
CHARLIE I'm flying a desk now. I'm a regional rep for the IAP. 
WHIP You're the rep for the pilots' union? 
CHARLIE I'm one of a few union reps for the southeast. When your plane went down all the reps got a page and since I know you I shot my hand up and said I wanted to come and be the first face you'd see. 
WHIP I'm glad it's you. 
WHIP starts to weep as he needs to begin the long process of expressing this trauma. 
CHARLIE It's good to see you too, Cowboy. You're gonna be okay. We're gonna take care of you. That's my job. 
WHIP nods as he wipes his eyes on his heavily bandaged hand. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) The union will put out a statement on your behalf. Condolences to the families who lost loved ones and gratitude to the brave men and women on the flight crew. (WHIP NODS) And I know you and Deana have been divorced for a while but maybe she and your son...? 
WHIP Yeah, Knuckles. 
CHARLIE Yeah, how old's he now? 
WHIP The meds they're giving me are fucking me up -- I'm all shaky and dried out. I can't sleep good. 
HARLING immediately picks up the small paper cup that holds WHIP's pain meds. He fishes out the two pills and stares at them. HARLING shakes his head. 
HARLING MAYS Aprazolam? That's generic Xanax and this Hydrocodone is generic Vicodin. It's shit, prolly Canadian. 
HARLING casually tosses the pills down his gullet and expertly swallows them without water. He grabs WHIP's medical chart and scours it as he prattles on... 
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) We want the premium stuff. Blue label...not the fucking well shit. Where's the dihydromorphinone? 
Or just some fucking Palladone would suffice. What is this? Fucking amateur hour over here? Get that goddamned doctor in here. You just saved a 100 people from death, they should get your fuckin' meds right. (calls to the door) YO! ROOM SERVICE! 
WHIP Listen Harling, leave it alone. (HARLING CHILLS) So you got my message and decided not to call me back? Did you bring me smokes? 
HARLING MAYS I decided to come by instead. And yes I got your fucking message and yes I brought you smokes. 
HARLING hands WHIP a pack of smokes from his pocket. He also pulls out a carton of smokes from his backpack. 
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Here is a fresh carton, enjoy. You fucking earned it -- you smoke your nuts off, champion. If I were you I'd fire up right here in the God damn room. Fuck'em, you're immortal, you're a fucking God man. 
WHIP Harling... 
WHIP motions with his hands to "calm down." 
HARLING MAYS Sorry Whip. It's just...this is big time, man. You're a hero in a time when we really need heroes. 
WHIP Shut the fuck up, Harling...Six people died. 
HARLING MAYS 96 people lived! When are you gonna take yes for an answer? Pick up the phone, man. Fuck. 
HARLING pulls something from his vest pocket and puts it in WHIP'S hand. WHIP looks at it and back at HARLING. 
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Here's a pint of Smirnoff and a few Red Bulls. You know what I'm sayin'? I know my customer. 
HARLING continues to pull items from the bag. 
WHIP Harling, take the vodka with you. 
HARLING freezes his frenzied energy with this odd command. 
HARLING MAYS What?! Take the vodka? Dude, are you insane? I'm gonna just tuck it in the bottom of your- 
WHIP Take the fucking vodka! 
HARLING hears him this time and raises his hand and nods, putting the VODKA back in his own duffel. HARLING tosses a tee shirt, sweat pants and flip-flops on the bed, then... 
HARLING MAYS Okay man. Check it out. 
HARLING holds up a silk Japanese Happi Coat, with elaborate stitching depicting colorful birds flying around Mt. Fuji. 
WHIP Look, I'm tired man. 
HARLING MAYS I'm out. You rest up. 
WHIP You gotta come and get me, tomorrow. 
WHIP pulls his keys from the bag that CHARLIE gave him. 
WHIP (CONT'D) Here are my keys. Go to the condo and bring me some nice clothes I can wear, my phone charger and grab the veal outta my fridge. It's marked. 
HARLING MAYS The veal? 
WHIP Yeah, the veal that's in my freezer. 
HARLING MAYS Done and done. What time you need me here? 
WHIP Tomorrow. I'll call you. 
HARLING MAYS Send the mayday and you're outta here in 7 minutes. (A SMILE) I got you a few stroke mags too. I've been in hospitals. I know what you need. JUGS, HOT MILFS in heat. ASSMASTERS. You should just stroke it all day. You're a hero -- know what I'm saying? If I was in here I'd be jerkin' it all day long. See, there's a smile. 
HARLING puts his hand on WHIP's forehead in an attempt to reassure him. A quiet moment before HARLING slips out. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- 11 PM -- SAME EVENING 
WHIP wakes up in a cold sweat. He is breathing heavy as he scans the room. LIGHTENING FLASHES from outside the window. Thunder RUMBLES. 
WHIP looks to the night stand where we see a pack of nicotine gum has been chewed through. WHIP uses his hands to get to the edge of the bed. He roots through the duffle bag that HARLING left and finds a pack of smokes and a Bic lighter still in its package. 
Determined to smoke, WHIP eyes a WHEEL CHAIR that has been placed next to his bed. Leaning against the wheelchair is a medical cane. 
INT. HOSPITAL -- QUIET HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER 
Wearing his Happi Coat (or robe), WHIP limps in to the empty hallway with the use of his cane. He checks the quiet corridor as he begins his quest... 
INT. HOSPITAL -- FIRE DOOR -- 11:38 PM 
The door swings open, and no one appears to be on the other side. Now WHIP fights to push the heavy door open again to slip through. A hand grabs the door and holds it. WHIP walks into the sanctity of the stairwell. 
INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWELL -- SAME TIME 
We find the owner of the helping hand was NICOLE who returns to a quiet spot along the wall of the stairwell as she demurely smokes a cigarette. 
WHIP Thank you. 
WHIP leans his cane against the wall and carefully pulls a pack of smokes from his pocket. 
WHIP (CONT'D) I didn't think anyone would have the same devious thought about using the fire stairs to have a smoke... 
NICOLE smiles and looks down, awkward around men when she is not loaded. She drops her cigarette which we see was barely smoked as she maneuvers to leave. 
WHIP (CONT'D) Don't go. I'll be quiet. 
WHIP Here's a pack. 
GAUNT YOUNG MAN Thank you, I'll pass them out in the cancer ward. Take care Nicole, you're gonna be okay. 
The GAUNT YOUNG MAN leaves, clanging away with his I.V. pole. 
NICOLE wipes away her tears, we see her hospital bracelet as well as her track marks. 
NICOLE Chemo brain. Chemo makes you pretty foggy. 
WHIP Yeah? 
NICOLE They call it chemo brain, my mom used to slur her words and get all chatty. 
WHIP Your mom had cancer. 
NICOLE Breast cancer, she was only 54. 
It's quiet. 
WHIP But why'd that guy ask you if you were gonna die? 
NICOLE I dunno. I flat-lined twice in the ambulance. Heroin addicts who use needles tend to die. Especially women for some reason. 
WHIP Is that right? 
NICOLE I have a pamphlet to prove it. A girl from AA just came to see me -- (IT'S QUIET) That guy was a trip. He made it feel like, I dunno...we were the last people left on the planet.. (drops her smoke) ...and together we should save the world. 
NICOLE steps on her cigarette and puts the nub in her pocket. She begins to leave. WHIP stops her. 
WHIP Well, where should we live? If we're gonna save the world, where should we do that? 
NICOLE laughs. 
WHIP (CONT'D) What? 
NICOLE You don't want me. 
WHIP laughs. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) What? 
WHIP You don't want me either. 
NICOLE's laugh tapers off as she senses his honesty. 
WHIP (CONT'D) Where do you live? 
NICOLE Why you wanna come visit? It's luxurious. (silence between them) I live in Bankhead, it's south Atlanta, near the bus station. 
WHIP The luxurious bus station? 
NICOLE Yeah. 
WHIP I'll come visit you. 
NICOLE You're sweet. 
WHIP I will. What's your address? 
She measures him. 
NICOLE I live at the Georgian Gardens on Taylor street. 
WHIP Georgian Gardens? 
NICOLE Yeah. 
WHIP How long are you staying here? 
NICOLE Trying to stay as long as I can but I don't have insurance to cover rehab. I'll prolly be out tomorrow. 
WHIP Oh. Okay. And you're a masseuse? 
NICOLE Yeah. 
WHIP What kind of masseuse? 
NICOLE I've been every kind of masseuse there is. 
There is strong tension between them. An orderly busts through the down the stairs. This breaks their stare. 
WHIP Good luck Nicole. 
NICOLE You too. 
WHIP leaves NICOLE where he found her. 
EXT. ST. FRANCIS REGIONAL MEDICAL HOSPITAL-LOADING DOCK-DAY 
WHIP is wheeled out of a service exit by an ORDERLY who also holds the duffle bag of WHIP's stuff around his neck. Whip no longer wears the eye patch but has a butterfly bandage over his left eye brow. 
HARLING jumps out of his 2001 Cadillac STS and immediately takes over, grabbing the duffel bag. 
WHIP Thanks Mike. 
The ORDERLY tries to hand WHIP a medical file. HARLING snatches it. 
HARLING MAYS Yeah, thanks Mike. (Harling tips him) Here's 20 American. 
ORDERLY MIKE Thanks. Good luck, sir. 
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- AIRPLANE -- DAY 
Whip walks past the plane and starts to examine the large, two-story, open-ceilinged barn that is junked full of farm equipment and old furniture. He finds... 
A WALL OF PHOTOS -- WHIP WITH HIS FATHER NEXT TO A PLANE. HIS GRANDFATHER, FATHER and WHIP pose next to the barn. 
A CROP DUSTER acts as the background for a picture with a 15 year old WHIP and his father next to a small plane. 
A series of pictures feature the PLANE in flight and SHOTS TAKEN FROM THE PLANE, aerials of the farm, etc. 
WHIP holds the framed shot of he and his dad as he walks back to the plane, resting his arm on the wing. 
WHIP pulls himself from the wall of photos and stares at his stuff. We recognize what must be the stuff he took from his house after his divorce. We see bikes, weights and fishing gear. 
Whip rummages through a box of things packed from his home office. Trophies, sports memorabilia, citations -- A PHOTO OF HE AND HIS WIFE from happier times. THEIR WEDDING PHOTO. 
Now Whip comes upon A FRAMED BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO of he and Charlie in their younger, Navy days -- wearing flight suits and standing on a carrier flight deck in front of an F-14 Tomcat. Big smiles, full of hotshot pilot swagger. 
WHIP puts the photo back and spots his golf bag. He roots out a pint of cheap vodka from the inner pocket. 
Next he finds a fifth of bourbon in his bicycle saddle bag. 
He goes to the workbench and removes a couple of bottles from the paint shelf. 
EXT. BARN -- DAY 
63 Whip dumps out the liquor onto the grass as he hobbles back 63 to the house. 
EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- NIGHT 
65 WHIP uses just his cane now as he drags a garbage bag full of empty liquor bottles to his garbage cans. He tosses the bag of empties in a can. His work done, WHIP lights a smoke and stares at the empty fields that run forever as does the landscape of his mind. He quietly tries to grasp the horror he endured and the reality of his survival. 
INT. KITCHEN TABLE -- LATER THAT NIGHT 
We hear the microwave beep and WHIP retrieves a frozen dinner. 
INT. WHITAKER FARM--LIVING ROOM DESK AREA--MOMENTS LATER 
WHIP sits at the coffee table eating his frozen dinner while watching news coverage of the crash. 
PHONE RINGS 
WHIP is startled by the phone that never rings. He snaps off the TV using the remote. 
WHIP is in no hurry to answer the phone as the old time ring continues. WHIP goes to the desk where the phone rests and he watches the old answering machine click on. We hear... 
WHIP'S FATHER'S VOICE You've reached the Whitaker Crop Dusting Company, flying lessons and plane rides. Please leave a message and it will be returned. Thank you. 
VOICE MAIL ...I think that was the beep. Hey Cowboy, it's Charlie again. 
WHIP reaches for the phone but decides to just listen to CHARLIE... 
CHARLIE (speaking to voicemail) I'm back in town and I stopped by the hospital tonight but they said you went home...so I guess you're feelin' pretty good, but um we went out to your condo and the manager said you had not returned. 
INT. CARR'S OFFICE -- ATLANTA BASEBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT 
CHARLIE sits at a beautiful wooden table in a modern glass- walled office above a baseball field. The table is populated with casually-dressed businessmen and lawyers as this after- hours meeting was called on the fly. 
CRASH SCENE PHOTOS and FILES fill the table top. We also see a photo or two of the WHITAKER FARM. 
VOICE MAIL So...you may be with relatives, which I understand. I was really hoping to see you for breakfast. I'm at the St. Regis downtown. 
There's an executive buffet on the 16th floor - 10 o'clock, okay? If you get this, please come. Some important stuff to cover. Be good. 
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM -- DESK AREA -- NIGHT 
WHIP stands still as a beep sounds, ending the message. 
INT. ST. REGIS HOTEL -- EXECUTIVE BUFFET -- MORNING 
The executive buffet is a staple at the ST. REGIS. A long center table with silver trays houses eggs and breakfast meats. Fruit, bagels and a staff of servers cater to the business elite of Atlanta. 
CHARLIE ANDERSON sits at a corner table with HUGH LANG, a young, well-dressed African American man. CHARLIE and HUGH are chatting in jocular spirit when WHIP approaches, walking much more confidently with his cane. 
CHARLIE Whip, hey buddy. Glad you got my message. Grab a seat. 
WHIP studies HUGH as he pulls out his chair. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Whip this is Hugh Lang; he's an attorney from Chicago. 
HUGH stands and shakes hands with WHIP. 
HUGH Nice to meet you Captain Whitaker. 
WHIP and HUGH remain standing, both feeling a little "alpha." 
CHARLIE Siddown. Coffee? (Whip nods, sits) Miss, can we get some fresh coffee? 
She smiles and nods. She's off to get the coffee. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) We were just talking about your copilot's wife. She told a newspaper that "God landed that plane." 
WHIP God landed the plane? 
WHIP just stares at the two men who have large buffet plates surrounding them. 
CHARLIE I too believe that God landed that plane. The same way I believe that God should hit the buffet, the turkey sausage is excellent. 
WHIP I'm good with coffee. 
CHARLIE Len Caldwell was really trying to get here this morning. (Whip seems lost) Len is the president of the pilots' union and he wanted to be here with us and meet with you but they wanted him at the crash site. So.. 
Close on TV -- A SPLIT SCREEN -- CNN's PIERS MORGAN on one side of the screen asking questions of JIM TILMON, an aviation expert. 
WE NOW SEE A PHOTO OF WHIP IN HIS SOUTHJET AIRLINE UNIFORM. 
PIERS MORGAN Captain Tilmon, we wanna play a portion of the black box that all of the news outlets have grabbed hold of... 
WHIP (ON TELEVISION) When I ask for power, push both of these forward. Got it? What's your son's name? 
WIDER...WHIP STEPS UP TO THE BAR, GLANCING AROUND. 
The BARTENDER steps up to serve WHIP... 
BARTENDER What'll you have? 
WHIP Can I get an orange juice? 
The BARTENDER leaves to grab the orange juice. 
TELEVISION -- The transcription and AUDIO of the cockpit recording continues... 
MARGARET (O.S.) Trevor. 
WHIP (O.S.) Say "I love you Trevor." 
MARGARET (O.S.) Why? 
WHIP (O.S.) The black box. 
MARGARET (O.S.) I love you Trevor. Be a good boy. Mommy loves you. 
The BARTENDER returns with the orange juice. 
BARTENDER That's it? 
WHIP And a double shot of Stoli. 
The BARTENDER nods and turns in acknowledgement of the order. 
PIERS MORGAN (ON TELEVISION) Wow. That audio paints a strong picture. Captain Whitaker is surely a hero in my opinion. 
JIM TILMON (ON TELEVISION) Absolutely. However, every incident is different. The actions of the pilots on SouthJet 227 will be heavily scrutinized. It's protocol for any investigation. 
The BARTENDER returns with a frosted glass and pours two shots over the ice. 
WHIP downs the vodka in a flash. 
The OTHER BARTENDER has the remote and starts searching for more coverage of the crash. He stops at a local report. 
ON TELEVISION WE SEE 
EXT. CRASH SITE -- DAY 
A REPORTER gives a lead in at the crash site. 
CRASH SITE REPORTER #1 Kevin, it's still chaotic here at the site. Apparently a small ministry was conducting services near to where the plane came down. So the scene here is a mix of survivors and first responders, I was able to catch up with an actual passenger moments ago... 
A YOUNG SHORT HAIRED BLONDE MAN GIVES HIS ACCOUNT 
PASSENGER 1 We were in a nose dive and people were screaming and yelling and then the plane turned upside down and we had to hold on to our seat belts to keep from falling out of our chairs -- I saw one kid fall to the floor and this flight attendant picked him up and handed him to his dad...I didn't see her again. 
CRASH SITE REPORTER #1 More details and more reports of the casualties are continuing to fly around. I can tell you that there appears to be many, many survivors. That's all I have for now. Kevin? 
Another reporter has a passenger's account. 
CRASH SITE REPORTER #2 Rebecca, surviving passengers are being put in ambulances, police cruisers and even first responder vehicles and they are being taken to local hospitals for treatment. Some of the injured appear serious and it's safe to assume at this point that there are at least a few fatalities. Let's roll the tape of the passenger I caught up with earlier. 
A MAN with SHORT DARK HAIR explains his experience. 
PASSENGER 2 We turned like a corkscrew and all I could think was, "this is really happening, I'm going to die" and then all of a sudden the plane was upside down but steady and the pilot must have known how to fly it that way. He flipped it back over and landed it hard. 
CRASH SITE REPORTER #2 Obviously a harrowing ordeal for those on the troubled plane. This is Callie J Kenner for News 5. 
A third Reporter gets a FEMALE NEIGHBOR's perspective. 
CRASH SITE REPORTER #3 Folks in the houses that border this field came running from their houses... 
NEIGHBOR I thought it was thunder at first. But it shook the ground hard. Thunder don't do like that. I ran outside and I could hear people yelling and I could see a small fire at first. I just took the dogs and headed down there. Then I saw the plane crumpled on the ground. I never seen nothing like that in my life. 
CRASH SITE REPORTER #3 Just like that plane, this community is shattered. Folks here remain on edge as media trucks continue to line their small road and crowd the field where the plane still lies. Back to you, Tom. 
EXT. CRASH SITE -- NIGHT 
A news light shines on a lone reporter who stands atop a small hill above the crash field. 
CRASH SITE REPORTER #4 We're gonna take another look at the cell phone footage that captured the last moments of SouthJet's Flight 227. 
WE SEE THE GRAINY CELL PHONE FOOTAGE OF THE PLANE 
After the PLANE levels off and smacks down in the field, we return to REPORTER #4 in the crash field. 
CRASH SITE REPORTER #4 (CONT'D) Many hours have passed since the footage you just watched but the crash site remains active as investigators work through the night. Using flood lights and miners' caps, teams continue to comb the crash field looking for the answers to the hard questions as to what brought down SouthJet's flight 227. Those answers remain in darkness as do the broken pieces of the aircraft. Hopefully sunlight will bring answers. For now this is Kent Johnson reporting. 
INT./EXT. WHIP'S BUICK -- QWIK STOP LIQUOR STORE -- DAY 
A 12-pack of beer hits the passenger seat as Whip climbs behind the wheel. Whip cracks open a "handle" (half-gallon) of vodka and takes a liberal pull. Whip's shoulders relax as the alcohol kicks in. 
71 After a moment, he starts the car, shifts into gear -- downs 71 another huge slug of vodka -- and pulls out. 
INT. WHIP'S BUICK -- ATLANTA STREET -- DAY 
Whip is at the wheel. A cigarette in one hand, an open beer in the other. He cruises slowly -- searching street signs with his beer-buzzed eyes. 
WHIP Your car doesn't run? What were you gonna do? 
NICOLE I don't...I...I was... I don't know what I was gonna do. 
Fran smirks. Whip drills Fran with his eyes... 
WHIP (with deliberate malice) Then put the fucking box in my car. 
FRAN's smirk fades. He relents and picks up the box as WHIP grabs the lighter shoulder bag and they head downstairs. 
INT. WHIP'S BUICK -- DAY 
NICOLE stares out the window as the city disappears. 
WHIP pulls a beer from the box and offers it to Nicole. NICOLE smiles, thinks about it...she shakes her head, "no." 
WHIP pops the top and takes a drink. 
NICOLE What's your name? 
WHIP looks to her, she to him. They begin to laugh at the absurdity. When it subsides... 
WHIP Whip. 
NICOLE nods. A long moment quietly passes. 
NICOLE Thank you, Captain Whip. 
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' "You Really Got a Hold on Me" plays as WHIP eases himself into a recliner using his cane. On the small table next to him rests his beer and an unopened bottle of bourbon with a glass of ice. WHIP cracks the seal on the bourbon bottle and pours a drink. He takes a sip and chases it with his beer. 
WHIP now starts to remove the brace that we clearly see under his basketball shorts. As he takes it off he tries to massage his aching leg. 
NICOLE enters the living room, fresh from a shower. WHIP studies her -- she's beautiful and innocent. 
WHIP You okay? 
NICOLE I was gonna lay down, get some rest. 
WHIP Okay. 
WHIP takes another sip before returning to massaging his leg. 
NICOLE Is it really okay that I stay here? 
WHIP Yea. I want you to stay. 
NICOLE walks over to WHIP and kneels down and gently takes over massaging his leg. WHIP exhales. 
WHIP (CONT'D) That feels better. 
NICOLE It's throbbing because the blood is having a hard time getting back to your heart. 
78 NICOLE continues to soothe his aching leg. After a moment, 78 NICOLE stands and takes the drink out of WHIP's hand and sets it down. She now bends down and kisses him softly. She now stands and takes his hand, leading him in to the bedroom. 
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- WHIP'S BEDROOM -- DAY 
WHIP's been awake for hours as he sits at the foot of the bed. Whip's wearing a long sleeve tee shirt and sweat pants and no shoes. He looks at NICOLE -- sleeping angelically on her side of the bed. Whip watches her sleep for a long moment, until... 
80 He hears something. He gets up and goes to the window. It's a car pulling up the driveway. 
INT./EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- KITCHEN DOOR -- DAY 
WHIP opens the door to find HUGH in his driveway. 
WHIP casts a strange figure with his bare chest, boxers and brandishing a shotgun. They stare at each other. 
HUGH Do you wanna shoot me or can I come inside? 
WHIP C'mon in. I'll shoot you inside. 
HUGH walks closer to the porch. WHIP questions him. 
WHIP (CONT'D) You just decided to drop by? 
HUGH Your voice mail is full and you never answer your cell phone. I called your cell 10 times. 
WHIP I turned it off. 
HUGH nods as the explanation lands. 
HUGH I thought we'd take a ride. 
WHIP measures HUGH's intention... 
WHIP Okay, gimme a minute. Wait here. 
82 HUGH nods and recedes from the door as WHIP goes to get 82 dressed. 
EXT. CRASH SITE -- OBSERVATION SCAFFOLDING -- DAY 
WHIP joins HUGH on a rectangular platform on top of a two- story scaffolding frame. The platform provides a perfect view of flight 227's final resting area. We see the awesome devastation that 50 tons of metal flying at 140 miles an hour can do to a hillside. 
HUGH You can see the initial impact sheared the right wing clean off. If only the left wing had come off at impact, I think everyone would have walked off that plane. 
WHIP The left wing partially pulled away- 
HUGH It snapped but stayed connected to the airframe. So it whipped back towards the plane, hit the fuselage in front of the tail. If you were sitting in the last 6 or 7 rows on the left side, it was like being hit by a train. 
WHIP I drank a lot the night before that flight. I drank that morning too and I used coke to straighten up. 
HUGH I'm gonna kill the toxicology report. (feels eyes of disbelief) It was done incompetently. The last time the toxicology equipment they used was calibrated was in June of 2009, which is 18 months past code. Their log that should clearly state who labeled the blood vials and when, is very incomplete. And they aren't sure who stored them. They used a preservative in the vials that has in some cases caused blood to ferment and register higher in an alcohol test. That's what I've done so far. I can handle this. 
MR. CARR I like this guy Lenny. He makes me wanna go out and sniff a few lines and fly a jet. 
LEN CALDWELL Mr. Carr, we're gonna fight to push all the fault on Jackson Ridgefield, the manufacturer. 
MR. CARR Oh and you think they're gonna just open their check book and buy us all lunch? Good fucking luck. What's my exposure Jim? 
CARR'S BUSINESS GUY The awards to the families could kill the airline. 
MR. CARR Fuck the airline. The insurance companies can have the goddamm airline. I just don't want them to come sniffing in my other pockets. 
LEN CALDWELL Speaking for the pilots' union? We don't want your airline to go away. We enjoy your contract with us and we will protect Captain Whitaker and in turn protect your airline. 
MR. CARR That's sweet Mr. Caldwell, but if the NTSB leaks that toxicology report showing my pilot was flying that plane drunk? We're all fucked. 
CHARLIE So far we've been lucky. 
MR. CARR Lucky?! Are you that goddammed dumb?! You think they're waiting for a light news day to splash the headline, "Drunk, coke-addled pilot crashes a plane?!" 
EVERYONE goes quiet as CARR's anger commands silence. 
MR. CARR (CONT'D) My brother's in DC on his knees at the foot of the throne begging for forgiveness. And so far it's working. 
They've got their boot on the neck of this girl Ellen Block runnin' the show for the NTSB and she is pissed. Can you handle that? 
HUGH can't stifle a laugh. They look to him. 
HUGH LANG Trust me, I'm gonna kill the toxicology report. That's my job. 
CARR looks to his lawyer who nods... 
CARR'S ATTORNEY I wish you luck, but we're still sorting out the best way to go forward legally. We might split from you and go it alone. 
CARR stands to signal the end of the meeting. HUGH stands to stop him. 
HUGH LANG To go it alone? Without us? That would be what the French call "a big fucking mistake." 
MR. CARR Does Whitaker know he's going to jail? 
HUGH LANG I haven't had a client go to jail yet. 
MR. CARR He's going to jail. He belongs in jail. You bet your ass he's going to jail, the question is...is he gonna die in jail? 
HUGH LANG You're wrong, Mr. Carr. 
CARR'S ATTORNEY Last time I checked, 6 counts of manslaughter is life in prison. 
MR. CARR Life in prison, what we in Georgia call "all day long." 
It goes quiet as everyone reflects on that reality. 
INT. CARR'S OFFICE -- WAITING ROOM -- DAY 
WHIP stands up as the meeting spills into the waiting room. Handshakes are exchanged as CARR walks to WHIP and offers his hand to shake. 
MR. CARR They tell me you're some kind of pilot. 
86 CARR nods, sizing WHIP up. WHIP returns the nod as HUGH 86 quickly puts a hand on WHIP's back and leads him away like a heavyweight being returned to his corner after pre-fight instructions. 
THE TELEVISION IN WHIP'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
We are now in WHIP's living room watching HOME MOVIES... 
WHIP'S VOICE Get up! What? You can't get up?! (Whip is laughing...) C'mon, Knuckles Whitaker drags himself up and goes long...go. 
We watch an 8 year-old WILL WHITAKER run long as the ball flies to him. He catches it and on-screen WHIP hollers. 
WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D) Touchdown Whitaker! Atta boy! C'mon back. What? Come back and do it again. Tired? Junior, you don't know tired. I'm not going out. You go out. Keep running. 
We pull away from the screen to find WHIP who sits on the couch. A large bottle of vodka appears empty amidst many dead beers and an ashtray that overflows. 
WHIP moves in drunken slow motion as he attempts to free a cigarette from the pack and light it. He freezes at one point and places his hands straight out in front of himself, a strange, involuntary, drunken reset. His stare is a 1000 miles offshore; he is anywhere but on this planet. Oblivion. 
The light from the HEADLIGHTS of a car in the driveway wash across the walls of the living room. We hear a car door open and women exchange good byes. 
SHEILA (O.S.) Keep coming back, Nicole. One day at a time. 
NICOLE (O.S.) I know, one day at a time. 
87A We hear them laugh as WHIP still stares in to space. 87A 
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- DOOR -- NIGHT 
The door pushes open and NICOLE comes in with the Big Book of AA in her hand. 
NICOLE Hey. Sorry I'm a little late, but we went for coffee after the meeting... (Whip doesn't look) Whip? 
NICOLE goes close to see WHIP look at her with a non-focused stare. She sees the table and reads the situation. 
NICOLE watches as WHIP stands up. In his oblivion he tries to focus. 
WHIP Don't, don't, don't! I'll get him. Knuckles, junior. See him. Yeah. I'm not calling again. Fuck him. He didn't call. Not back. Not calling back. 
NICOLE backs away as she watches the blacked-out ballet play itself out in slow, tragic fashion. WHIP motions to his lips as if he is smoking. He freezes and then steps forward and trips in to the coffee table. Whip falls to the ground. 
NICOLE checks WHIP's face to see his eyes partially opened but passed out. NICOLE goes to the bedroom and returns with a blanket that she covers WHIP with. She also places a pillow under his head making sure that his head is titled to the side so he doesn't choke. 
NICOLE looks around the room. She begins to collect the bottles and straighten up. 
INT. WHITAKER FARM -- BEDROOM -- MORNING 
WHIP I'm nervous because I was out the night before the crash at dinner- 
MARGARET With Trina... 
WHIP Yeah and I had two glasses of wine. And they might ask you about my condition that morning and if you thought I had anything to drink. 
MARGARET appears speechless... 
WHIP (CONT'D) What? 
MARGARET I've known you 11 years and you're gonna stand here and tell me you and Trina went to dinner and you drank two glasses of wine? Sounds like a nice restaurant Whip, which one was it? 
WHIP You have to tell them it was an ordinary day. I mean it was an ordinary day. You know I was in shape to fly. You have a problem with saying that? 
MARGARET It's a lie. Whip, it's a lie. Trina told me you two hadn't been to sleep. 
WHIP My lack of sleep made the plane fall apart, huh Margaret? I'm just trying to get it straight. You think that another pilot would have been able to land that plane and save more lives? 
MARGARET I didn't say that Whip. I can't imagine another pilot doing- 
WHIP Well can you imagine Trevor at this same church looking at you in that box in there? Or my son having to come and see me in prison? 
MARGARET fights tears as WHIP has struck a blow. 
MARGARET Please Whip, enough. Don't you think we've all had enough. (Whip is quiet) What do you want me to say? 
WHIP It was an ordinary day. The storm right after we took off was very severe, but as far as the flight crew was concerned it was a perfectly ordinary day. 
The tears flow now as MARGARET can't hold them in. WHIP realizes he's gone too far. Not knowing what to do, WHIP walks away. 
EXT. PEACH STREET DRUGS - AZURE BLUE SKY OF AUTUMN -- PHARMACY -- PARKING LOT - DAY 
WHIP watches an airliner fly over head as he stands by his car smoking a cigarette. He wears his suit from the funeral. NICOLE approaches. She's in a great mood. 
NICOLE Are you okay? How was it? 
WHIP It was okay, okay. How're you doin'? 
A beat. 
NICOLE Well, I got through my first day. They haven't fired me. 
WHIP That's good. Cause for a celebration. 
NICOLE They needed someone to work the night shift. They asked me and it's time and a half so... 
She sorts through her shoulder bag... 
NICOLE (CONT'D) I gotta vest and here's my name tag. Oh oh oh....I got you something.. (hands him a nice lighter) It's a P-51 mustang on there... (flies her arms like WINGS) You're dad flew a P-51, right? 
WHIP (stares at the lighter) He did. So should we get some dinner? 
NICOLE I promised Sheila I would be at the meeting tonight. She's the one that's been helping me, my sponsor. Can we do it tomorrow night? And Please, Whip don't make me choose between dinner with you and the meeting. 
WHIP nods, playing with the lighter. 
WHIP No, it's okay. You should go. 
NICOLE Why don't you come with me? We'll eat after. It's an open meeting. 
WHIP Open meeting? 
NICOLE That means anybody can come. Anybody. 
WHIP Even me? 
She is bubbling with happy spirit; she's hot. She's hard to deny as WHIP can't help but smile at her. 
INT. ST. FRANCIS CATHOLIC CHURCH -- ATLANTA -- NIGHT 
A MAN stands at a podium wearing a coat and tie. He is lost in the energized retell of a story. 
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 The cop is shining his flashlight on me. I'm standing there behind the dumpster, wearing nothing but my girlfriend's panties, vomit on my chest and I say to the cop...about two beers. 
The room erupts with laughter. NICOLE is really taken by the candor of the speaker as she joins the room in laughter. 
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D) That's why they call me "Two-Beer" Barry. 
BARRY makes eye contact with a STERN LOOKING OLD TIMER. BARRY holds up a loose leaf binder and addresses the man... 
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D) Don't worry Ed, I got the format right here. I'm sorry, Ed's giving me the stink eye. Let me get back to the format... (reads from the format) I'm Barry. I'm an alcoholic. 
THE ASSEMBLY (IN UNISON) Hi Barry. 
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 Are there any other alcoholics present? 
WHIP glances around to find himself in a sea of raised-handed alcoholics. A few look at WHIP with no judgement. 
A.A. SPEAKER # 1 (CONT'D) I like meetings that have us all identify. Because it makes me tell the truth about who I am. It reminds that I never ever told the truth. I lied about everything. My whole life had been a lie. And I was told that I would never get sober if I kept lying. 
WHIP is very reserved, poker-faced. 
A.A. SPEAKER #1 I mean, lying's what I'm good at. If I know anything in this life it's how to lie, especially about my drinking. 
We pan the faces and everyone seems immediately connected. Except WHIP who leans over to NICOLE. 
WHIP I gotta go. Okay? (NICOLE NODS) Can uh... (points to Sheila) 
NICOLE Yeah, Sheila. She can take me back to work. 
SHEILA (extends her hand) I'm Sheila. 
INT. NTSB HANGAR -- THE REMAINS OF FLIGHT 227 - DAY 
WHIP is now alone in the huge, brightly lit hangar. He sees the plane. 
The JR-88 has all of its pieces laying as close together as possible. Like the skeleton of a T-Rex in a museum. The sight is awesome, breathtaking. WHIP walks closer to the twisted wreck and stops. WHIP is overwhelmed by the sight and as he is about to leave... 
CHARLIE steps out of the passenger door and calls down to WHIP. 
CHARLIE Here's our guy. C'mon. 
WHIP walks towards a ramp that leads up to the hole in the plane where the door used to be. CHARLIE stands at the top of the ramp. Suddenly HUGH steps out of the plane... 
HUGH Captain Whitaker, we've won. 
WHIP doesn't move as HUGH starts down the ramp. 
HUGH (CONT'D) This is what we call in my profession a "walk over." 
CHARLIE They've scheduled the hearing. It's in 10 days. 
CHARLIE and HUGH reach the bottom of the ramp. 
HUGH But these hearings can be tough. You just need to stay sharp and on course and answer the questions correctly. It's no longer a question of your condition but the condition of the plane. 
This picks directly at the scab of WHIP's guilt. 
HUGH (CONT'D) I've had an "Act of God" successfully added to the list of probable causes. 
WHIP Look, it's simple. I flew a broken plane. 
CHARLIE You got it. That's right. 
WHIP And what about my toxicology report? 
HUGH (trying to stay calm) I killed it. They have no physical proof that you were intoxicated on that plane. And no eye witness claims. But there's a problem. 
This stops WHIP cold. 
HUGH (CONT'D) Because of the turbulence at the beginning of the flight and then the crash, there was never any drink service on the flight. But, they found two little vodka bottles in the galley trash bin. There was no physical evidence found on the bottles, no DNA, no finger prints. But both the bottles were uncapped and empty. The only people who had access to those bottles and could have drank them were the flight crew. Margaret, Evans and Camelia Satou all had clean tox reports. That leaves you and Trina Marquez. 
They let that land. WHIP nods. 
WHIP Okay. I see...where this is going. That's funny that they found two bottles. 
HUGH Why? 
WHIP Because I drank three. One's missing. 
HUGH explodes in frustration. 
HUGH LANG When I met you I couldn't believe what a flip, drunk, arrogant scumbag you were. 
WHIP Fuck you too, Hugh. 
HUGH LANG But I did the research and heard the analysis from the experts. I'm in awe of what you did. 
WHIP Can I go now? 
HUGH gets big as he has to add the final piece of credence to the coronation. 
HUGH LANG THE NTSB AND THE FAA TOOK 10 EXPERIENCED PILOTS AND PLACED THEM IN SIMULATORS. THEY RECREATED ALL OF THE EVENTS THAT LED TO THIS PLANE FALLING OUT OF THE SKY! 
HUGH is so loud and emotional even WHIP lends focus. 
HUGH LANG (CONT'D) Do you know how many were able to safely land these broken planes? 
Everyone waits for the response as HUGH acknowledges the debris around them... 
HUGH LANG (CONT'D) Not one. Every pilot crashed and killed everyone on board. 
WHIP Yeah. So? 
HUGH You have no capacity to accept the responsibility for the miracle you performed and the lives you saved. 
WHIP Great. I'm going home. 
WHIP pulls out his cigarettes and frees a smoke from the pack. 
HUGH LANG Do you want to go to prison? I'm trying to save your life! 
CHARLIE steps between them as this exchange spirals. 
WHIP What fucking life?! Don't kill yourself on my account, Hugh. 
WHIP starts to walk away. 
HUGH Okay, I'm done here. I'm running out a faith that this guy's gonna make it, Charlie. 
WHIP (turns on Hugh) You wanna talk about me like I'm not here? Like I'm fucking dead? 
HUGH (to Whip now) This NTSB hearing is a Federal Agency Hearing. Do you understand that? It's in 10 days and if I show up with you like this?! 
WHIP turns and walks. HUGH wheels on CHARLIE and lights him up. 
HUGH (CONT'D) Everything we've done? Everything I've done? Goes out the window. That's not on me. I did my job. It's your job, Charlie, to get him straight and get him to the church on time. 
WHIP Yeah Charlie just get him home. Sober him up long enough to save the union's contract and that fat fuck's airline. Fuck you. I shoulda died on that plane. 
106 WHIP walks away from them -- away from the bright, clean, 106 shiny floor of the hangar and into the growing rain storm. 
EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE THE WHITAKER FARM -- DAY 
The POLICE begin to disperse the NEWS RATS. WHIP pulls an officer aside. 
WHIP I'm Captain Whitaker, I was- 
YOUNG COP Yes sir, I know who you are. 
WHIP Can you get me to my car? 
YOUNG COP (STUDIES HIM) Anything you need, sir. 
WHIP walks with the YOUNG COP who shields him from the fray. 
INT. WHIP'S BUICK -- DEANA'S STREET -- MINUTES LATER 
We can see the YOUNG COP standing in front of the driver side door, shielding WHIP from the press who stay away. 
116 WHIP exhales, trying to slow his racing heart and head. He's drunk but controlled. He looks at his hands. They are shaking. 
INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE -- OFFICE - CLOSE ON TELEVISION - NIGHT 
We see WHIP on the TV repeating the speech he gave reporters on DEANA's front lawn... 
WHIP Now is a time for grieving and taking care of those injured. Thank you. I appreciate your interest in me but I ask that you leave my family in peace. 
A REPORTER now wraps up the piece... 
TELEVISION A reasonable request from a quiet, heroic man who's been through so much. This is Tilda Banden reporting from Devonwood. 
Now a DESK ANCHOR changes stories... 
DESK ANCHOR In a related story, tonight at 10 Cale Rawson talks with aviation experts to see if the tragedy of flight 227 could have been avoided. 
We boom down to find WHIP who looks drained as he sits on CHARLIE's couch in the fastidiously neat office. WHIP holds an unlit smoke. 
The WOODEN POCKET DOORS SLIDE OPEN and CHARLIE's WIFE gestures towards WHIP. WHIP stands as CHARLIE enters. 
WHIP Hey, Charlie. Thank you. Amanda was so nice to let me in. It's just...I couldn't find a safe place. 
AMANDA slides the door shut as CHARLIE throws his bag and his coat down with gusto. He reaches up and pushes a button on the TV and it goes off. 
CHARLIE What the hell is wrong with you? I spoke to Hugh, he told me that you went to your ex-wife's house? Drunk as a skunk and the news crews showed up? (Whip just stares) And the police escorted you out? 
WHIP I think it's okay. I've been watching and I think it's okay. 
CHARLIE Hugh checked every media outlet that covered it and it looks like we're good. You come off fine. 
WHIP Okay. Good then. Listen Charlie, here's the deal- 
CHARLIE No Whip. No deals. Look at you. I have no idea what you're gonna do or say, ever. You're all over the place. I was the one guy in your court. I was your apologist, your defender. But not anymore. 
WHIP No. I can do this. 
CHARLIE You're about to be questioned by a Federal Agency about piloting an airliner drunk...an airliner that crashed. And you continue to drink and stumble around. What kind of crazy do you have to be to do that? I'm scared of you. 
WHIP Let's just stick to the plan. 
CHARLIE You can't stick to anything. 
WHIP This whole thing has just been so heavy, it's killing me. Tell Hugh, I can do it. Look, I really wanna fly again, get back to my life and be done with all this shit. 
CHARLIE This hearing is 10 days away. Hugh busted his ass to try to get you excused, but there's no way. You have to appear. 
WHIP Let me stay here. They have my houses all staked out now. Let me stay here until the hearing, Charlie. I won't leave the house. 
CHARLIE takes a long look at his old, troubled friend. 
CHARLIE You can't drink here, Whip. You can't drink in my house. Can you do that? 
WHIP I won't drink. 
118 CHARLIE nods, hoping that WHIP can deliver on that promise 118 
INT. ST. JEROME HOTEL -- GUEST HALLWAY -- NIGHT 
We watch a can of Coca Cola swing in WHIP's hand. We pull out to find WHIP walking with CHARLIE down a hallway of THE ST. JEROME HOTEL. Time has passed as WHIP looks the best we've ever seen him look. He is well rested, well dressed and carrying a suit in a wardrobe bag. 
As we approach the open door to a guest room, HUGH pops out. A plain clothes SECURITY GUARD follows HUGH out of the room and stands behind him. 
HUGH You look great, Whip. I mean that. 
WHIP Thank you. I feel really good. 
HUGH I heard you haven't had a drink in 8 days. 
WHIP 9 days... (checks his watch) Two hours and 26 minutes...but who's counting? 
CHARLIE addresses the SECURITY GUARD. 
CHARLIE Officer Edmonds? 
OFFICER EDMONDS Yes sir. 
CHARLIE Whip, Officer Edmonds will be staying here tonight. Any problems he'll handle it. 
HUGH stands by the open door and gestures CHARLIE and WHIP inside... 
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
HUGH walks in to the center of the room and turns to WHIP. 
HUGH Well, Whip we just wanted to make this as easy for you as possible. 
Whip steps toward the box. 
CLOSE ON THE MINI-BAR. Whip swings open the door. 
WHOOSH -- OUR DARK SCREEN LIGHTS. 
COLORS SPARKLE as a cadre of tiny liquor bottles GLOW like jewels in a chest. 
WHIP stares at the "glimmering gems" for a long, long time -- vodka, gin, wine, bourbon. The bottles SHIMMER -- AMBER, CRYSTAL, EMERALD, RUBY. 
WHIP reaches for a frosted vodka mini bottle -- he gently pinches the neck of the bottle and lifts it out of the fridge. He holds up the mini vodka and considers it. 
Now Whip slowly removes the stopper and smells the White Whiskey. He looks at the bottle once more, then slowly twists the tiny cap back on. 
With a look of solemn resignation, Whip places the frosted mini bottle on top of the fridge and walks away. 
WE STAY CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE. The CAMERA FOCUSES on the small bottle as a small droplet of condensation runs down its side -- ever so slowly, slowly. Then suddenly... 
WHAP!!! In a flash, WHIP SCOOPS THE VODKA OUT OF FRAME!! 
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL - ELEVATOR DOORS - MORNING 
The ELEVATOR DOORS open and HUGH and CHARLIE step out and head down the hallway. 
We follow our guys as they approach WHIP's room, finding OFFICER EDMONDS exactly where we left him -- in front of WHIP's door. 
EXT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL - HALLWAY - WHIP'S DOOR - DAY 
OFFICER EDMONDS stands up as CHARLIE and HUGH approach carrying coffees. 
CHARLIE Good morning, how's our man? 
OFFICER EDMONDS Not a peep. 
CHARLIE knocks on the door and checks his watch as he waits for WHIP to answer. CHARLIE cocks his head, knocks again. 
CHARLIE I think your pilot overslept. 
HUGH You didn't let any girls in there last night did you? 
OFFICER EDMONDS No sir, not a soul. No one came in or out. 
They all wait awkwardly as HUGH checks his watch and knocks on the door. More silence... 
OFFICER EDMONDS (CONT'D) I have a room key. 
CHARLIE takes the room key and lets himself in. 
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- MORNING 
CHARLIE carefully enters WHIP's room. He is spooked by the silence. HUGH joins him as they take in the room. The bed looks slept in and the room service dinner tray rests politely on the dining table but WHIP is nowhere to be found. 
HUGH LANG Did he disappear? 
CHARLIE tentatively walks around the empty room, the bathroom, the closet, until he finally sees the adjoining room door. He turns to HUGH with a surprised look. 
CHARLIE Whip? Hello? 
CHARLIE knocks on the slightly opened adjoining door. No response, so CHARLIE lightly tosses the door open. 
INT. ADJOINING ROOM -- SAME TIME 
CHARLIE looks in to find the scene of the crime. Smoke still hangs in the air and empty bottles and cans cover every surface in the room. HUGH joins him... 
HUGH Where is he? 
CHARLIE Whip? WHIP! 
CHARLIE closes his eyes and says a silent prayer as he heads for the bathroom... 
BATHROOM -- ADJOINING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
CHARLIE is stopped by the sight of WHIP's lifeless body wedged between the tub and the toilet. 
CHARLIE WHIP?!!! WHIP!!! 
CHARLIE turns WHIP over to see his non-responsive face. HUGH arrives and freaks out. 
HUGH Is he dead? 
CHARLIE I DON'T KNOW!!! 
HUGH IS HE DEAD?! 
WHIP Yes!!! I'm dead!!! 
CHARLIE shows immediate relief that WHIP is breathing. OFFICER EDMONDS has joined them. 
OFFICER EDMONDS Should I get an ambulance? 
CHARLIE Yes! 
HUGH Wait!...just wait, Charlie...let's think about this. 
The two stare at each other and realize they are both breathing heavily from the shock and stress of their predicament. 
CHARLIE Get him to the bed... (to the Officer) 
Can you wait outside and don't let anyone in here? Thank you. 
EDMONDS leaves. CHARLIE and HUGH drag WHIP out of the bathroom and flop him on the bed. HUGH explodes. 
CHARLIE puts the glass of water to WHIP's mouth. WHIP drinks. 
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) (snaps his fingers) Coco puff... 
HUGH hands HARLING the cigarette with a slightly hollowed out tip. HARLING leans over the coke with the cigarette in his mouth and hoovers up a small pile, sucking the coke through the cigarette. 
HARLING sits up, careful to keep the cocaine in the end of the cigarette. He tips it up and lights it. 
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Little coco puff buddy. C'mon banana man. Who's the banana man? 
WHIP's head levels a look to Harling with a smile that leads us to believe that he is actually making a rally. 
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) Good man, focus up big dog. Here's the train comin' to you. 
HARLING takes a puff and holds it as he extends the cocaine cigarette to WHIP. WHIP is more nimble now as he cocks his head in acceptance of the cigarette. WHIP takes a drag and holds it. 
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D) (still holding the smoke) Keep it down big dog, banana boat's comin' tell me the banana boat's comin'... 
WHIP finally exhales the smoke, HARLING does too. WHIP smiles. 
WHIP The banana boat is here. 
HARLING MAYS Nothing can keep you down dog. Nothing keeps the big dog down. 
CHARLIE Okay, we gotta go. 
HARLING has crafted 4 big lines now, he snorts one himself in record time. Looks to HUGH and CHARLIE. 
HARLING MAYS You guys are up. 
HUGH No, I'm good. Charlie? 
CHARLIE Are you fucking crazy? 
WHIP jumps in and sniffs 2 huge lines. He looks to HARLING. 
WHIP Thanks brother, I'm back. 
HARLING gathers his things, stands and hugs WHIP. 
HARLING MAYS I love you man. 
WHIP I love you too. 
HUGH and CHARLIE are quiet as they watch the strange but sincere drug-fueled emotion pass between two old friends. HARLING eyes CHARLIE before handing him a baggie. 
HARLING MAYS There's a gram in here, you paid for it and he might need it. My work here is done. See you all on the dark side of the moon. 
HARLING leaves and our TRIO exchange looks, "Did that just happen?" 
EXT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- GUEST HALLWAY -- DAY 
133 The opening bars of Joe Cocker's "Feelin' Alright" crackle 133 just before we see WHIP step out of the hotel room and begin a relatively steady strut down the hallway. Deja Vu. Sunglasses on, WHIP is backed by HUGH and CHARLIE who flank him from a few steps behind. Further back we can see that OFFICER EDWARDS also exits the room wearing latex gloves, carrying a large plastic garbage bag that obviously holds any evidence of the debauched night or the morning's resurrection. 
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- ELEVATOR -- DAY 
WHIP, HUGH and CHARLIE ride the elevator. WHIP is buttoning his shirt and fixing his tie. It is miraculous how the coke has revived him. A MOM and her 8 year old DAUGHTER get on the elevator. 
CHARLIE Morning. 
We watch as a small trickle of blood escapes from WHIP's left nostril. HUGH pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, hands it to WHIP. 
HUGH Your nose... 
WHIP accepts the handkerchief and wipes his nose. WHIP sees blood on the cloth and tilts his head back. 
We now see that there is a mirrored ceiling to the elevator. WHIP tries to study his reflection in the ceiling as he holds the hankie to his nose. WHIP begins to wobble and CHARLIE helps him regain his balance. 
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL-ELEVATOR LOBBY-MOMENTS LATER 
Our TRIO walk as tall as they can towards the hearing room. 
HUGH I'm gonna head in and tell Ellen Block that we're here. 
HUGH hustles off as CHARLIE pulls close to WHIP. 
CHARLIE You're gonna make it. Remember, if they ask about your drinking, it's totally acceptable to say, "I don't recall." 
WHIP wheels on CHARLIE and unloads with focused anger... 
WHIP Do not tell me how to lie about my drinking. I've been lying about my drinking my whole life. 
As we disappear in to WHIP's weary eyes we hear the distinctive sound of a jetliner screaming through the air. 
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL - BALL ROOM - NTSB HEARING-DAY 
On TWO LARGE SCREENS we watch the grainy cell phone footage shot by a witness of SOUTHJET FLIGHT 227's final moments in the sky. ACCOMPANYING the Video is the REAL AUDIO of the cockpit voice recording... 
The room has a dais where the NTSB board members sit. A large blue curtain is the backing for the round NTSB shield that hangs above the proceedings. A large drop down screen will show images, graph and text as needed by the NTSB. 
A confident woman, ELLEN BLOCK, approaches carrying a file which she lays on the podium. 
ELLEN BLOCK Those are difficult images to watch. For the record, I'm Ellen Block, Hearing Officer for this hearing. Captain Whitaker, good morning. 
We see WHIP who looks rough but stable in his witness chair. 
WHIP Morning. 
ELLEN BLOCK What was captured on that video is that the aircraft was in a relatively stable glide just prior to the moment of impact. However, according to the data we retrieved from the cockpit data recorders, at exactly 9:34, after flying 27 minutes without incident, the transponder recorded a loss in altitude in excess of 4800 feet per minute in what is considered a "full pitch nose down" attitude. Then at 9:42, according to the data recorders, a decision was made to invert the aircraft. The NTSB has created animated simulation that I would like to play at this point. 
ELLEN points to the screen...

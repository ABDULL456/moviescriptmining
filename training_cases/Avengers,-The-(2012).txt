THE AVENGERS 
Written by 
Joss Whedon 
"And there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth's mightiest heroes and heroines found themselves united against a common threat. On that day, the Avengers were born--to fight the foes no single superhero could withstand! Through the years, their roster has prospered, changing many times, but their glory has never been denied! Heed the call, then--for now, the Avengers Assemble!" 
BURNING BLUE FLAMES. A smoky cube shape emerges - THE TESSERACT. Filling the screen with BLACKNESS. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THRONE ROOM, SPACE ­ NIGHT 
Kneeling behind a THRONE, a CLOTHED, ARMORED FIGURE known as THE OTHER, bows. 
THE OTHER (V.O.) The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a little world. A human world. They would wield its power,... 
CUT TO: THE OTHER faces a HORNED SHAPED SHADOW. LOKI. Loki is handed the CHITAURI SCEPTER, a long golden handle, fitted with a blue gem encircled with silver blades. 
THE OTHER (V.O.) But our ally knows its workings as they never will. He is ready to lead. And our force, our Chitauri, will follow. 
HIGH WIDE ON: TENS OF THOUSANDS of CHITAURI stand ready in a seething mass of neat rows and columns....the ground simply 
QUAKES. 
THE OTHER (V.O.) The world will be his. The universe yours. And the humans, what can they do but burn? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. S.H.I.E.L.D. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S FACILITY ­ NIGHT 
Out in the NEW MEXICO desert, a remote research facility is in a state of panic. It's an evacuation. A SWOOPING helicopter flies in. 
CHAOS. Men in suits run around like in the typical `we have to leave' fashion. Soldiers on foot jump onto Humvees, accelerating the hell out of there. A VOICE bellows from hidden loudspeakers. 
EXT. HELICOPTER PAD ­ CONTINUOUS 
Standing a few yards from the landing pad, A Fed in a suit with badass shades, peers at the helicopter as it lands. This is 
SHIELD AGENT PHIL COULSON. 
Walking out of the helicopter is SHIELD AGENT MARIA HILL, SEXY, FIERCE AND DETERMINED. Following her, SHIELD DIRECTOR NICK FURY climbs out. Hill and Fury approach Agent Coulson. 
NICK FURY How bad is it? 
AGENT PHIL COULSON That's the problem, sir. We don't know. 
INT. FACILITY FLOOR ­ NIGHT 
Agent Coulson leads Hill and Fury through the radiation section of the facility. Hundreds of technicians and other staff run around, taking only the essentials. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago. 
NICK FURY NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test phase. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in the room. Spontaneous advancement. 
AGENT MARIA HILL It just turned itself on? 
NICK FURY What are the energy levels now? 
AGENT PHIL COULSON Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered the evac. 
NICK FURY How long to get everyone out? 
AGENT PHIL COULSON Campus should be clear in the next half hour. 
NICK FURY Do better. 
CONTINUOUSLY HEADING DOWN TO RADIATION FACILITY FLOOR 
AGENT MARIA HILL Sir, evacuation may be futile. 
NICK FURY We should tell them to go back to sleep? 
LOKI I come with glad tidings, of a world made free. 
NICK FURY Free from what? 
LOKI Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart... Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart. Selvig's eyes glow BLACK. 
LOKI You will know peace. 
NICK FURY Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other thing. From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion. 
CLINT BARTON Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow. Drop a hundred feet of rock on us. He means to bury us. 
NICK FURY Like The Pharaohs of Odin. 
SELVIG He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself. You got maybe two minutes before this goes critical. 
LOKI Well, then... Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, SHOOTS FURY WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND. Barton grabs the case containing the Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel Loki is controlling. 
INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER, ENTRANCE OF EXITING TUNNEL ­ NIGHT 
Loki, Barton, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel are in the parking lot of the facility, quickly gathering certain weapons. Agent Hill watches in confusion, referring to Loki. 
CLINT BARTON (pointing to the Loki team) Need these vehicles. 
AGENT MARIA HILL Who's that? 
CLINT BARTON He didn't tell me. Agent Hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck and turns to leave, as she's walking away... 
NICK FURY (through the walkie talkie) Hill, do you copy?! Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill. 
BACK AT THE LAB Fury is sitting up, pulling out the bullet, breathing heavily. 
NICK FURY Barton is... 
INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER ­ NIGHT 
Suddenly, Hill turns to SHOOT AT BARTON, but Barton is already POINTING HIS GUN at her and starts SHOOTING, he moves the driver's seat of the truck and DRIVES OFF as Hill keeps shooting. 
BACK AT THE LAB Fury is holding his side, running. 
NICK FURY He's got the Tesseract! Track it down! The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the vacuum chamber ceiling. 
INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER/TUNNEL ­ NIGHT 
Agent Hill SLIPS into a JEEP and follows after Barton's truck.Loki's trucks SCREECH across the tunnel. Several SHIELD trucks pull up to them. A drive-by shooting ensues. Loki, who stands on top of the bed of the truck, uses his scepter and EMITS energy blasts, flipping over SHIELD trucks. They get in, the cars roar out after them. Agent Hill puts herself at a distance. 
INT. FACILITY FLOOR ­ NIGHT 
Fury races out of the hallway, avoiding falling pipes. The entire facility is now in a full earthquake. 
INT. FACILITY FLOOR, ELSEWHERE ­ CONTINUOUS 
Agent Coulson and several SHIELD agents fall down the steps, dropping SILVER CASES of information. They attempt to grab them, but... 
AGENT PHIL COULSON No! Leave it! They run out of there like a bat from hell. 
INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT 
Agent Hill's JEEP ROARS out of a side of Barton's truck and pulls up alongside them on the left. She goes way ahead and pulls her brake, swerving into a 360, facing Barton's truck and driving in reverse. Barton's ARMS reach out the open window and OPENS FIRE. Agent Hill figures `fuck it' and SHOOTS her windshield OPENING FIRE on Barton. 
EXT. VAN ­ NIGHT 
Agent Coulson jumps into a SHIELD VAN. On his walkie: 
AGENT PHIL COULSON You're clear, sir! You need to go! 
EXT. HELICOPTER PAD ­ CONTINUOUS 
Fury BOLTS out of the facility and jumps into a helicopter. The surface of the pad gives way, PLUNGING the helicopter through the surface. But Fury's chopper BARELY makes it out. 
INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT 
Still in a chase and drive-by sequence, Barton's pushes the pedal harder, which causes Agent Hill's JEEP to WOBBLE out and put her back behind. 
INT. RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER ­ NIGHT 
NATASHA Look, you can't pull me out of this right now. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON Natasha. Barton's been compromised. A beat. 
NATASHA Let me put you on hold. She nods to LUCHKOV. As Luchkov comes to take the phone off her, Natasha HITS him with her leg and HEADBUUTS him. Like a spider, she stands up elegantly and starts ATTACKING TALL THUG by KICKBOXING him in the face. Still tied, she ROLLS over WEASELLY THUG after she trips him. She then STOMPS on TALL THUG foot with peg of the chair, then 
KNOCKS HIM OUT WITH HER HEAD. Yeah, during all this Coulson is still waiting on the line. She then FLIPS over and FALLS down hard on WEASELLY THUG, BREAKING THE CHAIR. She sees TALL THUG stand. Giving her momentum, she runs at him DROP KICKING him, FALLS DOWN and FLIPS right back up and WRAPS HER LEGS AROUND HIS NECK 
AND KNOCKS HIM OUT COLD. She grabs LUCHKOV, wraps his leg around with a hanging chain and drops him down the open floor, dangling. She picks up the phone and her heels, like a boss. 
NATASHA Where's Barton now? 
AGENT PHIL COULSON We don't know. 
NATASHA But he's alive. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON We think so. I'll brief you on everything when you get back. But first, we need you to talk to the big guy. 
NATASHA Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON No, I've got Stark. You get the big guy. 
NATASHA Bozhe moi. 
EXT. INDIAN SLUM ­ NIGHT 
A LITTLE GIRL runs through the crowd, trying to force a way through. 
INT. SHACK ­ NIGHT 
A tiny shack. The LITTLE GIRL runs up the steps, only to be stopped by an attending woman. Then, the LITTLE GIRL spots him. BRUCE BANNER, their LOCAL doctor. 
ATTENDING WOMAN What are doing here?! Get out! You shouldn't be here! 
LITTLE GIRL I have to see the doctor! It's my father! 
BANNER Calm down. What's wrong? 
LITTLE GIRL My father... Banner looks behind him seeing how the girl is staring at a few people, lying down, looking very sick. 
BANNER Is he like them? The LITTLE GIRL holds out all the money she has in the world. 
LITTLE GIRL Please. 
EXT. SLUMS ­ CONTINUOUS 
Banner and the LITTLE GIRL hastily run nearly to the edge of town. The LITTLE GIRL gets ahead of herself. Banner spots local government car, he turns around, blocking any view of him. 
EXT/INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK ­ NIGHT 
Banner quickly follows the LITTLE GIRL inside her house. As he walks in, the LITTLE GIRL ESCAPES THROUGH THE WINDOW. Banner is left standing there like a dumbass. 
BANNER Should have got paid up front, Banner. Natasha then appears from behind the curtains. Banner turns around, quietly. 
NATASHA You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle. 
BANNER Avoiding stress isn't the secret. 
NATASHA Then, what is it? Yoga? 
BANNER You brought me to the edge of the city, smart. I uh... assume the whole place is surrounded? 
NATASHA Just you and me. 
BANNER And your actress buddy, is she a spy too? Do they start that young? 
NATASHA I did. 
BANNER Who are you? 
NATASHA Natasha Romanoff. 
BANNER Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff? Because that's not gonna work out for everyone. 
NATASHA No. No. Of course not. I'm here on behalf of SHIELD. 
NICK FURY PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We need a response team. 
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1 The Avengers Initiative was shut down. 
NICK FURY This isn't about The Avengers. 
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1 We're running the world's greatest covert security network and you're gonna leave the fate of human race to a handful of freaks. 
NICK FURY I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need. 
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2 You believe? 
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1 War isn't won by sentiment, Director. 
NICK FURY No, it's won by soldiers. 
INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT 
Somewhere in an old, almost WWII-esque boxing gym, STEVE ROGERS, a man out of time, THE FIRST AVENGER, FUCKIN' CAPTAIN AMERICA is PUMMELING a punching bag. With every swing, it's like a memory he's trying to fight off and repress. 
EXT. HYDRA BASE ­ DAY (FLASHBACK) 
Captain America is running through the forest, dodging mortars, gunfire and the Tesseract's energy firearms. 
STEVE (V.O.) There's not enough time! I gotta put her in the water! 
INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT 
Steve's rage keeps building as he punches the bag. It gets harder... 
INT. HORTEN H.XVIII, RED SKULL'S SHIP ­ DAY (FLASHBACK) 
Steve places his COMPASS with an image of PEGGY CARTER. The time is here for him to crash the plane. 
INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT 
Steve closes his eyes. Goes at the bag harder. 
PEGGY (V.O.) You won't be alone. 
INT. HORTEN H.XVIII, RED SKULL'S SHIP ­ DAY (FLASHBACK) 
The RED SKULL picks up the TESSERACT. 
INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT 
Steve opens his eyes and fuckin' tears the bag as the last memory kicks in. I don't think he can physically stop... 
SHIELD SCIENTIST (V.O.) Oh my god! 
INT. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S, ANTARCTICA ­ DAY (FLASHBACK) 
A half frozen Steve Roger is lying down on a medical slab. Two SHIELD SCIENTISTS run over hi-tech devices to see if his vitals are up. And it seems... 
SHIELD SCIENTIST This guy is still alive! 
INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT 
Steve FUCKING tears the bag open, off its chain, spilling out the sand. He stands, breathing hard, letting out 70 years of over repressed feeling. After taking a few breathers, Steve picks up another punching bag, which is laying next another DOZEN BAGS. He hooks the bag up and starts punching again. Fury walks in. 
NICK FURY Trouble sleeping? 
STEVE I slept for seventy years, sir. I think I've had my fill. 
NICK FURY Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world. Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the tape off his hands. He sits down. 
STEVE I went under, the world was at war, I wake up, they say we won. They didn't say what we lost. 
NICK FURY We've made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently. 
STEVE You here with a mission, sir? 
NICK FURY I am. 
STEVE Trying to get me back in the world? 
PEPPER Oooooh. 
TONY My private elevator... 
PEPPER You mean OUR elevator? 
TONY ...was teeming with sweaty workmen. I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I? Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne. 
PEPPER Not gonna be that subtle. 
TONY I'll tell you what. Next building's gonna say 'Potts' on the tower. 
PEPPER On the lease. 
TONY ...Call your mom, can you bunk over? 
JARVIS Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my protocols are being overwritten. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON Stark, we need to talk. Tony picks up his phone and looks into it at Coulson. 
TONY You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON This is urgent. 
TONY Then leave it urgently. At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears. 
TONY Security breach. 
(TO PEPPER) That's on you. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON Mr. Stark. 
PEPPER Phil! Come in. 
TONY Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent. 
PEPPER Come on in, we're celebrating. 
TONY Which is why he can't stay. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON We need you to look this over. (he holds out a file towards 
STARK) Soon as possible. 
TONY I don't like being handed things. 
PEPPER That's alright, `cause I love to be handed things. So, let's trade. She passes her glass of champagne to Coulson and takes the file from him, then takes her champagne glass back from Coulson and passes the file over to Stark. 
PEPPER Thank you. 
TONY Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON This isn't a consultation. 
PEPPER Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I know nothing about. 
TONY The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify. 
PEPPER I didn't know that either. 
TONY Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self- obsessed, don't play well with others. 
PEPPER That I did know. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON This isn't about personality profiles anymore. 
TONY Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute? Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own databases. 
TONY You know, I thought we were having a moment. 
PEPPER I was having twelve percent of a moment. This seems serious, Phil's pretty shaken. 
TONY How did you notice? Why is he Phil? 
PEPPER What is all of this? 
INT. STUTTGART GALA ­ NIGHT 
Loki looks from above the museum and descends down to where the HEAD DOCTOR is. As he makes it down and near the stage, he FLIPS his cane the other end. The guard there notices him, pulls out his gun, but Loki CLUBS his head in. CHAOS ERUPTS. Guests begin to leave the museum. Loki grabs the doctor and flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures BILCHSTEIM. Loki pulls out an OPTICAL TORTURE DEVICE. He PLUNGES down the doctor's eye. The doctor TWISTS in pain. 
EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM ­ NIGHT 
Suddenly, from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on screen. The doors to the facility open. Barton walks in and finds in a cabinet, a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium. 
EXT. STUTTGART GALA ­ NIGHT 
As the crowd runs away, Loki slowly walks out and materializes in his gold armor and helmet. The POLICE arrive and with no hesitation, he BLASTS the cars, FLIPPING them over and over. 
LOKI Kneel before me. The crowd ignores him. Another LOKI appears, blocking the crowd. Loki after Loki appears, they all grin as they raise their spears, encircling the crowd. 
LOKI I said. KNEEL!!! Everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him. Loki embracing his arms out, smiling. 
LOKI Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel. As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an ELDER GERMAN MAN refuses to kneel and stands, heroic. 
ELDER GERMAN MAN Not to men like you. 
LOKI There are no men like me. 
ELDER GERMAN MAN There are always men like you. 
LOKI Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example. Loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light GLOWS blue. Just as the ENERGY BEAM shoots out, FUCKING CAPTAIN AMERICA arrives! He dives in just in time and BLOCKS the blast with his SHIELD, knocking down Loki on his ass. 
CAPTAIN AMERICA You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing. 
LOKI 
(STANDING UP) The soldier. A man out of time. 
CAPTAIN AMERICA I'm not the one who's out of time. From above Cap, the QUINJET arrives. A machine gun is pointed towards Loki. 
NATASHA Loki, drop the weapon and stand down. Like greased lighting, Loki sends a BLAST of blue at the QUINJET. Natasha MANEUVERS it just in time, giving Cap the time to throw his shield at Loki. They both begin to DUKE IT OUT. Loki FLINGS Cap to the ground. Cap then throws his shield, but Loki SWATS it way. Cap, using all the moves of a boxer, is KNOCKED down by Loki. Standing over him, he points the scepter's tip on his helmet. 
LOKI Kneel. 
CAPTAIN AMERICA Not today! Cap FLIPS and KNOCKS him out with his leg. Loki grabs him and FLIPS him over. 
INT. QUINJET ­ NIGHT 
NATASHA The guy's all over the place. Suddenly, AC/DC's "Shoot to Thrill" overdrives the QUINJET'S speakers. 
IRON MAN Agent Romanoff, did you miss me? Both Cap and Loki look up at the sky. Tony flies over in his IRON MAN suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground. IRON MAN touches down. He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry the suit has. 
IRON MAN Make your move, Reindeer Games. Loki puts up his hands and surrenders. His armor materializes away. 
IRON MAN Good move. 
CAPTAIN AMERICA Mr. Stark. 
IRON MAN Captain. 
INT. QUINJET ­ NIGHT 
Natasha watches the skies. THUNDER. Coming out of nowhere. Fury speaks over her headset. 
NICK FURY (V.O.) Said anything? 
NATASHA Not a word. 
NICK FURY (V.O.) Just get him here. We're low on time. With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch from a distance, whispering. 
STEVE I don't like it. 
TONY What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily? 
STEVE I don't remember it being ever that easy. This guy packs a wallop. 
TONY Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates? 
STEVE What? 
TONY It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, doing time as a Capsicle. Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match. 
THOR Not here! You give up the Tesseract! You give up this poisonous dream! You come home. 
LOKI I don't have it. You need the cube to bring me home, but I've sent it off I know not where. Mjölnir flies back to his grasp. 
THOR You listen well, brother. I... 
THOR IS KNOCKED OFF THE MOUNTAIN BY IRON MAN WHO TACKLES HIM IN 
MID-FLIGHT. 
LOKI I'm listening. 
EXT. FOREST ­ CONTINUOUS 
THOR and IRON MAN CRASH into the forest. Thor rolls himself up. IRON MAN is still standing, but keeps his distance. The helmet opens up. 
THOR Do not touch me again! 
TONY Then don't take my stuff. 
THOR You have no idea what you're dealing with. 
TONY Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you weareth her drapes? 
THOR This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice! 
TONY He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then, stay out of my way... tourist. The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjölnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear across into a tree. 
INSIDE THE SUIT 
TONY Okay. From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises his hand. Mjölnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the hammer, summoning a ray of energy. IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch! Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mjölnir to his hand, raises it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back. 
INSIDE THE SUIT 
JARVIS Power at 400% capacity. 
TONY How about that? IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up. 
EXT. SKY ­ NIGHT 
The two battle. IRON MAN grasps THOR, elbowing him and SMASHING him into the side of a mountain. THOR LEAPS off the mountain and takes IRON MAN with him. 
EXT. FOREST ­ CONTINUOUS 
THOR and IRON MAN crash right back down, smashing down every tree possible. IRON MAN YANKS Thor right up. Thor grabs both HANDS BOOSTERS and begins to CRUSH them. Tony quickly CHARGES as much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor's face. Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. IRON MAN HEADBUTTS Thor, with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor... HEADBUTTS him with his fuckin' head and actually sends IRON MAN across the forest. IRON MAN boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up, ready. Thor runs with all his patience out the window. IRON MAN SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift him and SMASH him down hard. Thor summons back Mjölnir to his hand. Just as he's about to put the hammer down, IRON MAN uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him, but from behind him, IRON MAN CRASHES into his back. Thor stands facing IRON MAN. Ready to pounce... CAPTAIN AMERICA'S shield RICOCHETS off both Thor and IRON MAN, stopping them. They look up and see CAPTAIN AMERICA standing on top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand. 
CAPTAIN AMERICA Hey! That's enough! (comes down; looks at Thor) Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here. 
THOR I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes! 
CAPTAIN AMERICA Then prove it! Put the hammer down. 
IRON MAN Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his hammer! 
THOR BACKHANDS IRON MAN LIKE A PIMP WITH MJÖLNIR. Thor, losing all tolerance with this SENTENTIAL OF LIBERTY, raises the hammer. 
THOR 
(TO CAP) You want me to put the hammer down? 
THOR LEAPS HIGH INTO THE AIR, RAISING THAT FUCKING HAMMER. CAPTAIN AMERICA CROUCHES DOWN and HOLDS UP HIS SHIELD. THOR brings that hammer down onto the shield and a MASSIVE IMPLOSION OF LIGHT reacts to the vibranium shield creating a MASSIVE 
SHOCKWAVE THAT BLOWS UP ANYTHING STANDING WITHIN A MILE. IRON MAN stands up, looking around like `holy shit.' Lying right next to him is Cap, who never takes his eye off Thor. Thor looks at both men. 
CAPTAIN AMERICA Are we done here? 
THOR, CAPTAIN AMERICA AND IRON MAN STAND THERE. 
INT. HELICARRIER HALLWAY ­ NIGHT 
DOZENS of SHIELD POLICE escort Loki, who is in handcuffs, smiling. As they pass the HELICARRIER LAB, Banner stops working on the CHITAURI SCEPTER and looks up. Loki eyes him as he walks, nodding and smiling. BANNER rubs his head. 
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ NIGHT 
Loki is now free from his cuffs and is contained in a LARGE GLASS CELL held by HYDRAULIC RIGS. Fury walks up the control panel of the cell. 
COULSON) I'll fly you there. Keep the love alive. Means the portal won't collapse on itself, like it did at SHIELD. 
TONY (CONT'D) 
(TO THOR) No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing. (referring to the Iridium) Also, it means the portal can open as wide, and stay open as long, as Loki wants. 
(TO CREW) Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top sails. That man is playing GALAGA! Thought we wouldn't notice. But we did. (covering his eye, looks 
AROUND) How does Fury do this? 
AGENT MARIA HILL He turns. Tony looks around the monitors and places a BUTTON SIZE HACKING IMPLANT under Fury's desk, without anyone noticing. 
TONY Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source. A high energy density, something to kick start the cube. 
AGENT MARIA HILL When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics? 
TONY Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes, the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading? 
STEVE Does Loki need any particular kind of power source? 
BANNER He's got to heat the cube to a hundredand twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier. 
TONY Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect. 
BANNER Well, if he could do that he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet. 
TONY Finally, someone who speaks English. 
STEVE Is that what just happened? Tony and Banner shake hands. A glimmer in their eyes shines as the mutual respect for each other shows. 
TONY It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner. You're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. 
BANNER 
(LOOKS DOWN) Thanks. 
NICK FURY 
(WALKING IN) Dr. Banner is only here to track the cube. I was hoping you might join him. 
STEVE Let's start with that stick of his. It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon. 
NICK FURY I don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube. And I'd like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys. 
THOR Monkeys? I do not understand. 
STEVE I do! I understood that reference. Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself. 
TONY Shall we play, doctor? 
BANNER Let's play some. As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to playing. 
INT. BANNER'S LAB - NIGHT (LATER) 
Banner continuously scans with a gamma ray detection scanner on the scepter for radiation. Tony looks at his monitors, shifting and solving as many algorithms and equations. 
BANNER The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to process. 
TONY If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops. 
BANNER All I packed was a tooth brush. 
TONY 
(SMILES) You know, you should come by STARK TOWERS sometime. Top ten floors, all R&D. You'd love it, it's candy land. 
BANNER Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem. 
TONY Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension. No surprises. Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD. Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony. 
BANNER 
OW! Tony looks at Banner closely. 
TONY Nothing? 
BANNER And I'll read all about it. 
TONY Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us. 
BANNER Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor. I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a nightmare. 
TONY You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. (points at the MINI-ARC REACTOR in his chest) This stops it. This little circle of light. It's part of me now, not just armor. It's a... terrible privilege. 
BANNER But you can control it. 
TONY Because I learned how. 
BANNER It's different. Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face. 
TONY Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gamma exposure should have killed you. 
BANNER So you're saying that the Hulk... the other guy... saved my life? 
(MORE) 
BANNER (CONT'D) That's nice. It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what? 
TONY 
(A BEAT) I guess we'll find out. Banner and Stark get back to work at their respective computers. 
BANNER You might not like that. 
TONY You just might. 
INT. HULL HANGAR, SECURE STORAGE 10-C ­ NIGHT 
Steve, with all his MIGHT, slides the HEAVY IRON door and STEALTHILY walks in. SECURE STORAGE 10-C is a large warehouse, filled with METAL CRATES stacked. Steve looks up, seeing another level. He LEAPS up high and holds onto the catwalk railing. Steve continues to move forward. 
INT. VAN ­ NIGHT 
Inside this particular van, Selvig and a few other SOLDIERS are driving inside a long tunnel. With the CMS device inside, Selvig carefully picks up the small cylinder shape IRIDIUM with metal prongs and lightly places it a SLOT within the CMS. THE CMS ACCEPTS IT. Selvig looks at it, devilishly smiling. 
INT. BRIEFING ROOM ­ NIGHT 
On a SHIELD monitor is a photo and record of JANE FOSTER. Thor looks at her, remembering. With him is Agent Coulson. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON As soon as Loki took the doctor we moved Jane Foster. We've got an excellent observatory in Traunsee. She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee, private plane, very remote. She'll be safe. 
THOR Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for him once he's done. Erik is a good man. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON He talks about you a lot. You changed his life. You changed everything around here. 
THOR They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced, but we...we come here battling like BILCHSTEIM. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON Like what? 
THOR BILCHSTEIM? You know; huge, scaly, big antlers. You don't have those? 
AGENT PHIL COULSON Don't think so. 
THOR They are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path. Thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the window, lamenting about what has happened and what may come. 
THOR When I first came to earth, Loki's rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war. 
NICK FURY (O.S.) War hasn't started yet. 
(WALKING IN) You think you can make Loki tell us what the Tesseract is? 
THOR I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield, it's not just power he craves, it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain that would prize his need from him. 
NICK FURY A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops. 
THOR What are you asking me to do? 
NICK FURY I'm asking. What are you prepared to do? 
THOR Loki is a prisoner. 
NICK FURY Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here? Thor doesn't answer. 
NATASHA 
(ON EARPIECE) Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I'm on my way. Send Thor as well. 
(TO LOKI) Thank you for your cooperation. Natasha quickly walks out, leaving Loki frozen. 
INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING 
Fury walks in SURPRISED to see Tony and Banner stop working on the scepter. 
NICK FURY 
(ANGRY) What are you doing, Mr. Stark? 
TONY Uh...kind of been wondering the same thing about you. 
NICK FURY You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract. 
BANNER We are. The model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now. When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile. 
TONY And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. (suddenly his monitor show a collection of SECRET FILES) What is PHASE 2? Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed. 
STEVE PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make weapons. 
(TO TONY) Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow. 
NICK FURY (trying to explain) Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we're... 
TONY I'm sorry, Nick. Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of 
THE WEAPONS. 
TONY What were you lying? 
STEVE I was wrong, director. The world hasn't changed a bit. At that moment, Thor and Natasha walk into the lab. Natasha keeps her eyes right on Banner. Banner looks at her, PISSED. 
BANNER Did you know about this? 
NATASHA You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor? 
BANNER I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed. 
NATASHA Loki's manipulating you. 
BANNER And you've been doing what exactly? 
NATASHA You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you. 
BANNER Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction. 
NICK FURY Because of him. (pointing at Thor) 
THOR 
(STUNNED) Me? 
NICK FURY Last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned. 
THOR My people want nothing but peace with your planet. 
NICK FURY But you're not the only people out there, are you? And, you're not the only threat. The world's filling up with people who can't be matched, they can't be controlled. 
STEVE Like you controlled the cube? 
THOR You're work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for a higher form of war. 
STEVE A higher form? 
NICK FURY You forced our hand. We had to come up with something. 
TONY Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always calms everything right down. 
NICK FURY Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark? 
STEVE TONY I'm sure if he still made Wait! Wait! Hold on! How is weapons, Stark would be neck this now about me? deep... I'm sorry, isn't THOR everything? I thought humans were more evolved than this. 
BANNER LOOKS DOWN AND IS SHOCKED TO SEE HE'S HOLDING LOKI'S SCEPTER. The computer beeps. They all turn to it. 
TONY Got it. Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer. 
BANNER Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my little party trick after all. 
THOR Located the Tesseract? 
TONY I can get there faster. 
STEVE Look, all of us... 
THOR The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no human is a match for it. Tony turns to leave, but Steve stops him. 
STEVE You're not going alone! 
TONY You gonna stop me? 
STEVE Put on the suit, let's find out. 
TONY I'm not afraid to hit an old man. 
STEVE Put on the suit. At that moment Banner who's looking at the monitor notices something about the Tesseract. 
BANNER Oh, my God! 
OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER Barton PULLS THE TRIGGER ON HIS BOW. The arrow then EXPLODES THE 
ENGINE RIGHT OFF THE HELICARRIER! 
INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING 
Everyone is thrown in every direction. Steve, Fury, Thor and Tony are thrown across while Natasha and Banner is down in the lower equipment room. Steve looks up at Tony. 
STEVE Put on the suit! 
TONY Yep! Steve helps Tony up and out of the lab. Fury sits up, clutching his ribs. He puts on his EARPIECE. 
NICK FURY Hill?! 
INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY 
PANDEMONIUM ERUPTS. Emergency alarms set off, fire extinguishers activate near surrounding fires and every agent is in a spinning scramble for their positions and armaments. Agent Hill keeps the bridge as calm as possible. 
AGENT MARIA HILL Turn up that engine! Number 3 engine is down! Can we get a run in? (runs over to GALAGA PLAYER) Talk to me. 
GALAGA PLAYER (points to monitor) Turbine's loose. Mostly intact, but it's impossible to get out there and make repairs while we're in the air. 
AGENT MARIA HILL We lose one more engine, we won't be. Somebody's got to get inside and patch that engine. 
INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING 
NICK FURY Stark! You copy that?! 
TONY (V.O.) I'm on it! 
NICK FURY Coulson! Initiate official lock down in the detention section then get to the armory! Move out! 
INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY 
Agent Coulson runs out of the bridge. 
INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ MORNING 
Natasha looks over to Banner, who is breathing heavy, having landed hard. He is gripping the grated floor to maintain control, but his eyes are green, his face intense. 
NATASHA (CONT'D) (quietly, to herself) I'm okay. We're okay, right? 
EXT. HELICARRIER DECK ­ DAY 
Barton leads his men into the air ducts of the ship. They rappel down into a corridor. 
BARTON Get that engine down! Detention! Get him through the dark! Come with me. Two of his men follow him. They head towards the bridge. 
EXT. ND HALLWAY, CARRIER ­ MORNING 
EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY 
IRON MAN continuously BLASTS broken debris off the turbine engine. It's bad, but still fixable. 
CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.) The relays are intact. What's our next move? 
TONY Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump. I'm gonna have to get in there and push. 
EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY 
CAPTAIN AMERICA Well if that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded! 
TONY Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag... 
CAPTAIN AMERICA Speak English! 
TONY See that red lever? It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. Stand by it, wait for my word. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks over at the other side where he was. He sees the red lever and JUMPS towards it. 
INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT ­ DAY 
Thor CRASHES into another stack of crates. As he raises his head, he feels something on his lips. BLOOD. As he swipes it off, the ROAR of the HULK is not too far. Thor extends his hand out. The ROAR gets LOUDER and CLOSER. Thor focuses. His hand strains toward mid-air. His eyes tight in concentration. The HULK runs right at him. At the last second, MJÖLNIR flies into his hand and Thor UPPERCUTS HULK, WHO CRASHES INTO A FIGHTER JET. HULK stands up, shaking his head like `what the fuck just happened.' He SHAKES it off and ANGRILY rips off the TAIL of the jet, TORQUES HIS BODY LIKE A GREEK DISCUS THROWER AND... HURLS 
THE MASSIVE PLATE AT THOR. Thor SLIDES and DUCKS under the tail. Jumping up, he throws Mjölnir with all his strength, knocking the HULK head over heels. HULK falls down, hammer in hand. HE tries to lift it, but can't. Mjölnir rests atop his hand. Struggle as he may, HULK wraps his hand around the hammer. The hammer doesn't move. To no avail -- he strains with all his might, SCREAMS from the effort, BELLOWING. Thor jumps up again, KNEEING HULK in the face. Thor grabs his hammer, jumps on him, using the hammer as a lock for his CHOKEHOLD. Hulk tries to pull him off. 
INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY 
Fury and Agent Hill look over their monitors. 
NICK FURY We need a full evac on the lower hangar bay. Agent Hill nods. She leaves to exit out, but a SLIDING GRENADE appears. 
AGENT MARIA HILL 
GRENADE! The grenade goes off, sending her down the steps. Fury FIRES a shot at the open entrance. He moves over behind the side of the entrance. A handful of Barton's men enter. Watchful, ready, waiting... Fury steps out, his GUN drawn. A SHOOT OUT and HAND-TO-HAND ensues, but Fury is unable to stop one of them, which is why he is shot in the head by Agent Hill, who looks hot and sexy holding her gun. 
INT. HELICARRIER ARMORY SECTION ­ DAY 
Agent Coulson walks up the armory door. He places his head into a FACIAL RECOGNITION SCANNER. Walks into the room. 
AGENT JASPER SITWELL (V.O.) We got perimeter breach! Hostiles are in SHIELD gear. Hold on to every junction. 
INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT ­ DAY 
HULK CRASHES from under the floor, sending Thor on his ass. HULK grabs him by the neck. 
INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY 
A gunfight opens up. AGENTS exchange fire with brutally efficient tactical soldiers. 
AGENT JASPER SITWELL (V.O.) Sir, the HULK and Thor are in shuttle levels 2, 3 and 4! 
AGENT MARIA HILL Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart! 
NICK FURY Get his attention. 
AGENT MARIA HILL (on her EARPIECE) Escort 606, proceed to 270 MAIN SHUTTLE! Don't get too close. 
ESCORT 606 PILOT (V.O.) Copy. 
EXT. SKY ­ DAY 
ESCORT 606'S jet BANKS to the right, heading towards the shuttle. 
EXT. OUTSIDE SHUTTLE 
ESCORT 606 PILOT slowly makes his way in. sees the action going between Thor and the HULK. 
ESCORT 606 PILOT Target acquired. Target engaged. (pulls the trigger; fires guns at HULK) A SHOWER OF BULLETS SPRAYS THE HULK EVERYWHERE. Thor ducks for cover. The HULK turns around, letting out his PRIMAL ROAR. He jumps up, TAKES A RUNNING START AND LEAPS... 
ESCORT 606 PILOT LOOKS LIKE HE TOOK A SHIT. 
ESCORT 606 PILOT 
TARGET ANGRY! TARGET ANGRY! HULK LANDS ON THE JET'S NOSE. THE JET SPINS WILDLY. As the HULK tears it apart, ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his ejection seat, but 
HOLD THE FUCKIN' DOOR! 
EXT. SKY 
Thor, trapped in the glass cage, BOUNCES off the JUMBLING cell pod. As it draws closer to land, Thor tries to swing at glass, but misses. Land draws closer. In a final attempt before crashing, Thor positions himself onto the glass door and LEAPFROGS just as the cage is about to hit the ground. The cell CRASHES into the shore as Thor crashes out into the meadow. 
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY 
Loki has no remorse as he looks down. He closes the hatch and proceeds to leave. A WEAK VOICE. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON You're gonna lose. 
LOKI 
(TURNING) Am I? 
AGENT PHIL COULSON It's in your nature. 
LOKI Your heroes are scattered, your floating fortress falls from the sky...where is my disadvantage? 
AGENT PHIL COULSON You lack conviction. 
LOKI I don't think I... 
AGENT COULSON SHOOTS LOKI WITH HIS PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE, 
CAUSING LOKI TO BE BLOWN THROUGH THE WALL BEHIND HIM. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON So that's what it does. 
INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY 
Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN that the hatch has been open. Knowing Agent Coulson was sent there, he goes to. 
EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY 
IRON MAN continuously SPINS Engine 3, giving it all he has. THE ROTORS ARE PROPELLING PROPERLY AND FAST. The HELICARRIER LEVELS itself. 
INSIDE THE SUIT 
TONY Cap, I need the lever! 
STEVE (V.O.) I need a minute here! 
TONY Lever. Now! Tony lets go of the rotors. They spin by themselves. Tony is then caught in one. He is now fucked. IRON MAN slips into the rotors, getting chewed up. 
EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY 
CAPTAIN AMERICA CLIMBS up the loose cable and reaches the railing. BARTON'S MAN opens fire once more. CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls himself up and finally PULLS the lever. A VENT opens up from Engine 3. IRON MAN falls out, but the suit heavily damaged, hardly keeping him up. IRON MAN heads for Cap. BARTON'S MAN turns his AIM to IRON MAN, who TACKLES him into the wall. IRON MAN rolls over, tired. Cap lets out a sigh of relief. 
OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER The carrier that brought Barton and his team now leaves, taking Loki and his scepter. The carrier flies into the distance. 
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY 
Fury runs in finding Agent Coulson still alive, barely. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON Sorry, boss. They got rabbited. 
NICK FURY Just stay awake. EYES ON ME! 
AGENT PHIL COULSON No. I'm clocked out here. 
NICK FURY Not an option. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON It's okay, boss. This was never going to work... if they didn't have something... to... Agent Coulson looks away. Sighs his last breath. Nick Fury looks on grimly at Coulson. The medical team arrives. 
INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY 
NICK FURY (V.O.) Agent Coulson is down. Agent Hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on her headset, standing up. 
SHIELD AGENT (V.O.) Paramedics are on their way. 
NICK FURY (V.O.) They're here. 
INT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY 
Steve and Tony listen in as well. 
CLINT BARTON Loki, he got away? 
NATASHA Yeah. I don't suppose you know where? 
CLINT BARTON I didn't need to know. I didn't ask. He's gonna make his play soon though. Today. 
NATASHA We gotta stop him. 
CLINT BARTON Yeah? Who's we? 
NATASHA I don't know. Whoever's left. 
CLINT BARTON Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's eyesocket, I'd sleep better I suppose. 
NATASHA Now you sound like you. Natasha sits next to her partner and friend. 
CLINT BARTON But you don't. You're a spy, not a soldier. Now you want to wade into a war. Why? What did Loki do to you? 
NATASHA He didn't, I just... 
(SHE PAUSES) 
CLINT BARTON Natasha. 
NATASHA I've been compromised. I got red in my ledger. I'd like to wipe it out. 
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY 
Tony look at the empty cell container. He stands not saying a word. Steve walks in. 
STEVE Was he married? 
TONY No. There was a uh...cellist, I think. 
STEVE I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man. 
TONY He was an idiot. 
STEVE Why? For believing? 
TONY For taking on Loki alone. 
STEVE He was doing his job. 
TONY He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have... 
STEVE Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony. 
TONY 
(WALKS AWAY) Right. How did that work for him? 
STEVE Is this the first time you've lost a soldier? 
TONY (turns around sharply) WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching to Fury's fife! 
STEVE Neither am I! He's got the same blood on his hands as Loki does. Right now we've got to put that aside and get this done. Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list... 
TONY (looking at the blood stained 
WALL) He made it personal. 
STEVE That's not the point. 
TONY That is the point. That's Loki's point. He hit us all right where we live. Why? 
STEVE To tear us apart. 
TONY He had to conquer his greed, but he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That's what he wants. He wants to beat us and he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience. 
STEVE Right, I caught his act at Stuttengard. 
TONY Yeah. That's just a preview, this is opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built in the skies with his name plastered... 
(PAUSE) Sonofabitch! 
TONY Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage. You've got the blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink? 
LOKI Stalling me won't change anything. 
TONY No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You sure? I'm having one. 
LOKI The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will change that. What have I to fear? 
TONY 
THE AVENGERS. (Loki looks at him, confused) It's what we call ourselves, sort of like a team. `EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES' type of thing. 
LOKI Yes, I've met them. 
TONY 
(SMILING) Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one. 
TONY (CONT'D) But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demi-God; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them. 
LOKI That was the plan. 
TONY Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they'll come for you. From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE BRACELETS, a honing device. 
LOKI I have an army. 
TONY We have a HULK. 
LOKI I thought the beast had wandered off. 
TONY You're missing the point. There's no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it. 
LOKI (slowly walks up to him; raising the scepter) How will your friends have time for me,when they're so busy fighting you? Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing. Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING. 
LOKI It should work. 
TONY Well, performance issues. You know? In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across the room. 
TONY Jarvis. Anytime now. Loki grabs Tony by the throat again. 
LOKI You will all fall before me. LOKI THROWS TONY OUT THE WINDOW. Tony FREEFALLS down the tower. From behind Loki, an elevator opens and a RED POD SHOOTS out. The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit. It LATCHES onto Tony. IRON MAN. The suit FLIES up before he hits the ground or the gazing people. Loki looks up, angry. 
IRON MAN And there's one other person you pissed off! His name was Phil. Loki raises the scepter. IRON MAN FIRES at Loki, sending him on his ass. 
EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY 
Selvig looks up at the sky. The Tesseract's energy BEAMS into the sky. The beam then forms a VORTEX, which then opens up 
ANOTHER PORTAL. 
EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE 
A hole in space rips open, and from it, the CHITAURI ARMY SPILLS out in FLYING CHARIOTS, carrying ENERGY RIFLES with a bayonet on the end. 
INSIDE THE SUIT 
TONY Right. Army. IRON MAN flies up towards the portal. From his shoulders, a miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and FIRES. Like the JERICHO MISSILE, several targets are taken down unlike no missile. It's useless. THOUSANDS OF CHITAURI FLY OUT. IRON MAN flies towards the city. 
EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY 
The CHITAURI UNLEASH. New Yorkers fill the streets, staring at the fire fight in the distance. BOOM!!! The CHITAURI unleashes BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting storefronts aflame. 
AN EXPLOSION RIPS OUT THE WINDOWS OF THE TOP CORNER OF 
BUILDINGS. FLAME AND STONE RAIN DOWN. A DOMINO-EFFECT OF 
EXPLOSIONS RIPPLING ACROSS THE BRIDGE. 
EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY 
Loki walks onto the balcony as the SOUNDS of the CHITAURI rings out. He admires his soon to be kingdom. THOR LANDS ON THE TOWER. Loki turns to his ENEMY. 
THOR Loki! Turn off the Tesseract or I'll destroy it! 
LOKI You can't. There is no stopping it. There is only the war! 
EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING ­ DAY 
Thor grabs onto the tower. Raises MJÖLNIR and KRAKAKABOOM! A BLINDING BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding on 
MJÖLNIR. THOR AIMS THIS MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE TOWARDS THE PORTAL. 
THOR CHANNELS THE BLAST AND FIRES THE ELECTRICITY OUT AT THE 
CHITAURI SOLDIERS FLYING OUT OF THE PORTAL. THEY'RE BLASTED BACK 
IN A MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE. THE CHITAURI SOLDIERS CONVULSE, DROP 
DEAD TO THE GROUND. HE EVEN RIPS THE SHIT OUT OF A CHITAURI 
LEVIATHAN, WHICH THEN FUCKING EXPLODES. 
INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY 
Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the destruction going on in NEW YORK. Agent Hill walks up to him. 
AGENT MARIA HILL Sir. The council is on. OH SHIT. Fury presses his screen. 
EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING ­ DAY 
Atop the rooftop, HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the streaming flow of the CHITAURI RIDERS, hitting his mark each time. Hell, heeven AIMS his bow behind him, WITHOUT LOOKING and releases the arrow, EXPLODING a RIDER. 
HAWKEYE Stark. You got a lot of strings sticking to your tail. 
IRON MAN Just try and keep them off the streets. 
HAWKEYE Well, they can't bank worth a damn. Find a tight corner. 
IRON MAN I will roger that. IRON MAN does so and leads towards TIGHT CORNERS and in HAWKEYE'S view, who fires arrow upon and arrow, EXPLODING the CHITAURI RIDERS. IRON MAN keeps leading CHITAURI RIDERS UNDER TUNNELS, THROUGH OPEN PARKING GARAGES. He looks back. None left. 
INSIDE THE SUIT 
TONY Nice call. What else you got? 
HAWKEYE (V.O.) Well, Thor's taking on a squadron down on 6th. 
TONY And he didn't invite me? 
EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM ­ DAY 
We are looking INTO a conference room where office workers sit around a table. But the NOISE has caught one worker's eye, then another, and soon they are all rising, stepping to the window, mesmerized by what lies beyond. WORKERS' POVA CHITAURI LEVIATHAN SWIMS right in front of them. 
EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM ­ DAY 
Suddenly, another NOISE catches the worker's attention. THE HULK 
CRASHES THROUGH THEIR FLOOR. SLASHES HIS THROUGH THE ROOM, 
POUNDING AWAY AND JUMPS OUT ONTO THE JAW OF THE CHITAURI 
LEVIATHAN. THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN BEGINS TO HEAD DOWN, TRYING TO 
WAVE OFF THE HULK. 
EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY 
BLACK WIDOW, using the ENERGY RIFLE, is taken off her feet by a CHITAURI SOLDIER. She TIRESOMELY takes it down by cutting its throat. She grabs the ENERGY RIFLE, turns to attack. Cap stands there, holding his SHIELD. She slumps back, tired. 
BLACK WIDOW Captain, none of this is gonna mean a damn thing if we don't close that portal. 
CAPTAIN AMERICA Our biggest guns couldn't touch it. 
BLACK WIDOW Well, maybe it's not about guns. (gestures the flying 
CHARIOTS) 
CAPTAIN AMERICA You wanna get up there, you're gonna need a ride. 
BLACK WIDOW I got a ride. I could use a lift though. BLACK WIDOW backs up giving herself a running start. Cap lifts and angles his SHIELD. 
CAPTAIN AMERICA Are you sure about this? 
HAWKEYE Nat, what are you doing? 
BLACK WIDOW (V.O.) Uh... a little help! HAWKEYE pulls the trigger twice, nocks an arrow, and points it at Loki, smiling. 
HAWKEYE I've got him. 
FIRES. THE ARROW STREAKS DOWN THE CITY, STRAIGHT AT THE LOKI'S 
HEAD... 
SNATCH! LIKE A CAT, LOKI GRABS THE ARROW STRAIGHT OUT OF THE 
AIR...LOOKS STRAIGHT AT HAWKEYE, SMILING... 
BBOOOOMMM!!! THE ARROW EXPLODES IN LOKI'S FACE, CRASHING INTO 
THE STARK PENTHOUSE PAD. BLACK WIDOW looks down and building her momentum, she JUMPS of the chariot, lands on top of STARK TOWER, rolling herself to the edge. 
EXT/INT. STARK PENTHOUSE ­ DAY 
As Loki looks up, shocked at what just happened, THE HULK IS LEAPING UP AND KICKS LOKI, HURTLING TOWARDS THE GLASS WINDOW. He COLLAPSES as he hits the wall. THE HULK jumps in, ready to attack. Loki ROLLS himself up in a flurry of broken glass, 
STANDING UP TO THE HULK. 
LOKI 
ENOUGH! YOU ARE, ALL OF YOU ARE BENEATH 
ME! I AM A GOD, YOU DULL CREATURE, AND 
I WILL NOT BE BULLIED... 
HULK GRABS LOKI BY THE LEGS AND SMASHES HIM AGAINST THE FLOOR 
REPEATEDLY AND FINALLY THROWS HIM ASIDE TO THE GROUND, 
FLATTENING LOKI. 
HULK 
PUNY GOD. 
LOKI WHIMPERS IN PAIN. 
EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY 
BLACK WIDOW walks up the CMS machine. Selvig, slumped down, weakened, looks at her desperately. The Tesseract's energy is firing towards the portal, gaining in strength, at the surge of energy moving through the sky. 
BLACK WIDOW Doctor. 
SELVIG Loki's scepter, the energy...the Tesseract can't fight. You can't protect against yourself. 
BLACK WIDOW It's not your fault. You didn't know what you were doing. 
SELVIG Well, actually I think I did. I built in a safety to cut the power source. 
BLACK WIDOW Loki's scepter. 
SELVIG It might be able to close the portal. (Selvig looks down. He sees a 
GOLD GLEAM) And I'm looking right at it. 
EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY 
THOR rides on top of chariot, SMACKING SEVERAL RIDERS with the hammer. As Thor takes the reins, a CHITAURI LEVIATHAN crashes through a building, knocking him down to where Cap is, fighting off SOLDIERS. IRON MAN flies right next to the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN and aims his LASER BOOSTER at it. Nothing. 
JARVIS Sir, we will lose power before you cut through that shell. IRON MAN flies up ahead, facing the oncoming monster. 
IRON MAN JARVIS. You ever hear the tale of Jonah? 
JARVIS I wouldn't consider him a role model. 
IRON MAN FLIES TOWARDS THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, UNLEASHING EVERY ARSENAL ON THE SUIT. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN opens its mouth. IRON MAN flies in and BURSTS out the other end, making the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN collapse. IRON MAN rolls down the street. The wind is knocked out of him. He looks up with an overwhelming sigh as a SMALL BAND of CHITAURI SOLDIERS rush towards him, holding out their rifles. 
EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING ­ DAY

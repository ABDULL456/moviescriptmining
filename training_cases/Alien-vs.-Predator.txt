Aliens vs. Predator 
Dark Horse Prod. Presents 
ALIENS 
Vs. 
PREDATOR 
Screenplay by Peter Briggs 
EXT.  DEEP SPACE 
We OPEN on TOTAL BLACKNESS, a sea of stars spread across the infinite depths of space.  As the TITLES ROLL, we notice that three of these specks seem to be moving; one of them picking up acceleration and racing toward us.  Our perspective changes, and we catch a quick glimpse as it HURTLES past, and into the gravitational pull of a large brownish planet.  Kicking up SPARKS of FRICTION as it hits atmosphere. It seems to be manmade.  Or at least artificial. 
EXT.  PLANET SURFACE - DAY 
The planet is dead, barren.  Death Valley on a grand scale.  We watch the object plummet through the wispy cloud-cover, emitting a few last burning embers before falling to ground way-off in the distance.  A BOOMING ECHO resonates across the dusty plains, before settling back into an eerie silence. 
EXT.  FISSURE CANYON - DAY 
We're looking into a deep gorge, dark and sinister.  A howling wind whips dust into a sandstorm, reducing visibility to almost zero.  About seventy feet down there's a hole in the rock-face that just might be a cave entrance, and near is a peculiar SHIMMERING in the air.  We hear a mechanical BEEPING and the SHIMMERING disappears, replaced by FIVE humanoid SHAPES clinging to the sheer rock - each well over seven feet tall.  They are PREDATORS, a race of intergalactic big-game hunters on permanent safari; their clothing and weaponry a bizarre mix of aborigine and ultra-hi-tech.  In their hands are circular metal discs; 'smart weapons' which cut into the stone and give them purchase. 
PREDATOR-VISION. 
From their P.O.V., we see the fissure reduced to THERMAL HEAT SOURCES. The entrance registers as a black gaping void. 
INT.  FISSURE NEST TUNNEL 
The five hunters climb inside the rim of the tunnel, out of the wind's banshee wailing.  The lead PREDATOR reaches up to his headgear, pulling at the coupling pipes connecting it to a hidden breathing-apparatus. He removes the helmet, clips it to his rear utility pack, and takes a deep breath of the air.  A curious speckled pattern runs across his wide forehead, marking him different to the others; in addition, one of the fangs of his mandibles has been sheared away.  We'll call him BROKEN TUSK, he's the leader of the hunting party.  He reaches out a hand to caress the wall of the tunnel. 
Several feet in from the rim, it changes from rock to a textured biomechanical surface; a swirling mass of disturbing shapes.  He hurries forward in response to the GURGLING-HISS of one of his team who has found something. 
The other PREDATOR holds a telescopic spear up for scrutiny.  Skewered on the end is a shriveled FORM with eight spindly legs and a segmented tail; it's a FACEHUGGER, the first stage of the deadly ALIEN lifeform. BROKEN TUSK HISSES a caution to his party; they respond by pulling spears and elaborately-shaped swords.  Several shoulder-mounted plasma cannons slide up to firing position, tracking with their owners' helmets.  Thus armed, they move cautiously ahead...taking no chances. One helmeted PREDATOR pauses, scanning the area. 
PREDATOR-VISION. 
He switches through a variety of different views; infra-red, ultra- violet, enhanced motion-tracking.  Nothing. 
He's so pre-occupied with this task, he totally fails to notice the skeletal ALIEN loom up behind him, emerging from the biomechanical growth on the floor.  A barbed tail skewers the PREDATOR straight through the neck, splashing luminous blood across his chestplate.  A gargled DEATH-RATTLE issues from his throat, the band of PREDATORS spinning around in time to see him being dragged below the ground.  The band of extraterrestrial hunters have no time to come to his aid; they themselves are set upon by a half-dozen ALIEN WARRIORS.  The carnage is swift and terrifying, a blur of motion. 
Steel blades and serrated biomechanical limbs scythe the air, alive with the CRIES and HISSES of both adversaries.  One PREDATOR is pinned against the tunnel wall, his spear out of range.  The ALIEN claws away his face mask, and he finds himself dodging the ALIEN's toothed tongue, extended toward him with pile-driver speed.  He reaches down, grasping the 'smart-weapon' hanging from his belt and brings it up in an arc that terminates at the ALIEN's grinning face.  Big mistake.  The two are in such close proximity that the ALIEN's acidic blood sprays across the PREDATOR's head.  While their technology seems to be resistant to it, their bodies aren't:  the viscous yellow liquid begins burning into the PREDATOR's skin.  He kicks the skeletal corpse away with a HIDEOUS PIERCING SCREAM, clawing at his seared face. 
It all seems to be over as quickly as it began; there can be no question as to who were the victors.  The PREDATORS stand amidst a sea of biomechanical limbs strewn around like a charnel house.  As his companions begin to carefully decapitate the ALIEN skulls, BROKEN TUSK steps over the corpses to examine his fallen comrades.  The first PREDATOR to be attacked was killed instantly; he crosses to the other. What he finds causes him to react with pity and disgust.  His fallen comrade is only just alive; mandibles clicking frailly, half his head burnt away.  BROKEN TUSK watches the ailing PREDATOR slide a steel blade from it's sheath and offer it to him.  He takes it, knowing what has to be done.  Rolling the knife quickly over the back of his hand - the sort of elaborate trick seasoned Green Berets perform - he plunges it downward into the fallen hunter.  This unpleasant task accomplished, 
BROKEN TUSK straightens up and activates his wrist-computer.  A dark shape blots out the light coming from the entrance; a small PREDATOR shuttlecraft, sleek and elegant.  It hovers in the air with little more than a loud HUM, and extends a ramp.  The surviving PREDATORS leap aboard, carrying their trophies with the reserved silence of men returning from combat. 
One more thing need to be done.  BROKEN TUSK bends down and flips a sequence of keys on the dead PREDATOR's wrist.  A countdown is displayed in some unknown character-set, accompanied by a HIGH PITCHED BEEPING.  He then turns and swiftly boards the craft which takes smoothly to the air, it's undergear retracting. 
EXT.  PLANET SURFACE - DAY 
A white-hot fireball erupts out of the fissure, the result of the PREDATOR's suicide-destruct mechanism.  The shuttlecraft pulls quickly away, disappearing into the clouds. 
EXT.  SPACE 
A large spacecraft is suspended in orbit around the planet; the PREDATOR Mothership.  The shuttle heads swiftly towards it. 
INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - DOCKING BAY 
An airlock RUMBLES open and the PREDATORS file NOISILY into the Mothership's docking bay.  An OLD PREDATOR crouched against a strut takes time out from carving something into a block of wood to briefly look up at them.  Like the PREDATORS themselves, the ship is a curious mixture of old and new.  An elaborate frieze written in alien script runs around the wall, with racks of sophisticated equipment recessed into it.  Hatches lead off to various parts of the ship; we see BROKEN TUSK carry his ALIEN head off down one of them. 
INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY 
The gallery seems to be more mechanical than the rest of the ship. BROKEN TUSK enters, pausing next to a kind of readout device:  a cylindrical tube containing a substance similar to mercury which constantly changes it's mass into shapes and alien text.  He peers over the protective railing. 
WHAT HE SEES is magnificent:  a captive QUEEN ALIEN, the nucleus of the ALIEN society, fed by giant intravenous pipes.  Each of it's limbs is tethered by straining clamps preventing any movement.  To the rear, it's giant egg-sac glows and throbs, suspended by a jury-rigged sling. A SCANNING MECHANISM hangs above the EGGS the QUEEN lays, seemingly defying gravity.  As each EGG is scanned by a blue triangular beam - similar to a PREDATOR gun-sight - it becomes translucent, giving us a view of the pulsing FACEHUGGER inside.  This done, a manipulator are carefully loads several eggs onto a pallet, which then sinks into a hatchway in the floor.  It's an assembly-line of almost frightening mechanical efficiency. 
EXT.  SPACE 
We see a pod ejected from the Mothership, rocketing away from the planet into deep space.  The inference is obvious; the PREDATORS are seeding worlds with ALIENS to hunt. 
INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY 
The blue beam slides across one of the eggs, and suddenly changes to red, BEEPING rapidly.  BROKEN TUSK sees the flowing display-tank alter from a rotating simulation of an ALIEN WARRIOR skull to a representation of a QUEEN's head.  The manipulator arm swiftly grasps the EGG in question and moves it over to a protrusion on the floor. The causes the QUEEN to go berserk, straining at her bonds and SHRIEKING ferociously.  She's obviously been through this before and knows what's about to happen. The protrusionsplits open, spilling out an intense white light:  an energy-filled blast furnace.  The manipulator claw opens, the EGG drops in, and is no more. 
INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - LIVING QUARTERS 
An orange light plays across a wall of skulls, casting dark shadows into long-empty orbs.  BROKEN TUSK sprawls lizard-like across a flat slab of rock in the center of the room, inspecting his formidable arsenal of weaponry. Satisfied, he reaches out to run a finger across the jaw of his ALIEN trophy in an almost-erotic gesture.  He regards it for a long moment as if coming to a decision of some kind, before finally getting to his feet. 
INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY 
He sips gingerly from the cup of scalding liquid. 
PARSONS Where'd you leave them? 
KAMEN Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow. 
CASSIE MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones. 
KAMEN Shit.  When? 
CASSIE Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four. 
KAMEN looks ill. 
KAMEN Fucking great.  I invested some money in them. 
CASSIE You win some, you loose some. 
KAMEN I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with? 
CASSIE No, but I got something that might interest you. 
HIROKO enters, pulling on a leather jacket. 
HIROKO What've you got? 
KAMEN nods to her and receives a quick smile for his trouble.  They turn to watch the display clear, replaced with a computer simulation of the neighboring solar system. 
CASSIE A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time. 
PARSONS We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure. 
CASSIE Yeah.  Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace. 
The simulation ZOOMS IN, revealing two unidentified objects heading towards the planet in the center of the display.  Computer notations accompany them. 
CASSIE (CONT'D) Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive. 
HIROKO Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles. 
PARSONS That's what we thought. 
HIROKO Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through? 
PARSONS Done it already.  Nothing matches. 
CASSIE And if you thought that was interesting, watch this... 
HIROKO watches the course of the two objects simultaneously change. 
KAMEN Jesus. 
PARSONS Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at. 
KAMEN Tactical nukes, maybe? 
Everybody gives him a quick look, but nobody says anything.  It's obviously not an appealing thought. 
HIROKO Where're they headed? 
CASSIE We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion. 
There's a great exhalation of breath, and everyone swaps significant glances. HIROKO seems worried.  She scratches her forehead. 
HIROKO I don't know what to make of this.  Get a copy of the telemetry relayed back to Antarctica Traffic Control.  Better alert the nearest RimCorp Base, too. 
PARSONS nods, suddenly serious. 
PARSONS Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em? 
HIROKO Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions. 
EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - SWAMP - AFTERNOON 
Down here in the swamp, the trunks of magnificent trees terminate in gnarled roots and disappear into watery murk, much like a Louisiana bayou.  A group of attentive LEMUR-TYPE CREATURES suddenly bound for cover as a line of bullets THUDS into the wood nearby.  Seconds later, a loud HUMMING NOISE intrudes O.S. and a pair of manta-ray-shaped hover-bikes with sleek lines and garnish decals SLAMS into FRAME suspended two feet above the mire, their powerful turbines kicking-up a swirl of spray.  The two BIKERS skid to a halt and watch the CREATURES scatter.  ACKLAND and YORK - men who on Earth might be called "good 'ol boys" - are both riding one-handed; powerful hi-tech rifles gripped in the other. 
YORK   (yelling) You missed 'em, Ackland! 
ACKLAND Little fuckers move too fast.  Let's do a sweep and catch 'em on the other side. 
YORK nods his head, pulling his goggles down over his eyes.  The two bikes ROAR off in pursuit. 
KAMEN 'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me? 
HIROKO Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs. 
HIROKO takes a sip of her drink, her brow furrowing. 
HIROKO (CONT'D) This whole thing's got me spooked. 
KAMEN hops off the wheel. 
KAMEN Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight. 
HIROKO Do you think Ackland'll sit tight? 
KAMEN There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to. 
EXT.  SPACE 
A peculiar blue scanning beam plays over the rotating mass of the incapacitated satellite, examining every section.  it comes to the rent torn through it, and pauses. 
FROM THE SCANNER'S P.O.V., we see the structure of the satellite made up from a series of blue geodesic shapes.  The damage registers as a cold, black mass. 
The beam switches off and the hovering PREDATOR shuttle turns smoothly on it's axis, thrusting towards the planet. 
EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SITE - NIGHT 
Shafts of torch-light fan out above the thick foliage in the darkness. YORK and ACKLAND wade through the chin-high reeds, cursing. 
ACKLAND Found anything? 
YORK looks down at his data-stick, a handheld torch with a multi- purpose readout screen. 
YORK Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing. 
ACKLAND Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus! 
ACKLAND falls toward onto something, and YORK comes running. 
YORK What is it? 
ACKLAND steadies himself, and the two men shine their torches at the rhythmically-breathing SHAPE on the ground. 
ACKLAND It's a rhino. 
YORK Is it dead? 
ACKLAND No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.  Are you sure your stick's not broken. 
YORK looks at the data-stick again. 
YORK Yeah, it's fine. 
ACKLAND God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus. 
YORK I told you we... what's that? 
Their torch beams PAN ACROSS a three-foot high ovular shape. 
ACKLAND Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe? 
YORK Bloody big if it is.  Top's open. 
ACKLAND steps cautiously forward to shine his torch inside. 
YORK (CONT'D) Careful... 
There's nothing inside.  ACKLAND looks disappointed. 
ACKLAND It's hollow.  Think our rhino must've ate something that didn't agree with him. 
A heavy gust of air blows unexpectedly across the clearing with a BANSHEE HOWL, ruffling their hair. 
YORK Let's get back and call this in. 
ACKLAND Wait a minute. 
YORK reluctantly follows ACKLAND as he thrashes through the thinn ing foliage, coming out at the rim of the impact crater.  It's beginning to partially collapse, water seeping in.  YORK runs his beam over something at the bottom of the shallow pit. 
YORK What is that... is that metal fragments? 
ACKLAND's maybe getting a little nervous now. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER 
With nothing to do, most of the screens are out and the remaining personnel bored.  PARSONS is reading a magazine with his feet up on the console, uninterested in HIROKO and KAMEN's conversation nearby. 
HIROKO I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder. 
KAMEN Agreed. 
HIROKO When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit. 
KAMEN Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now. 
HIROKO What do you mean? 
URIOSTE walks up, very serious.  She interrupts. 
URIOSTE Sorry.  Can I have a word? 
HIROKO Sure.  What's up? 
URIOSTE Three-Pump failed a half-hour ago.  The algae must have clogged up an intake duct. 
KAMEN Think I spoke too soon... 
HIROKO Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference? 
URIOSTE I reckon it'll be another day before the smell gets unbearable. Beauvais usually fixes it, but... ah... 
HIROKO knows what she means.  BEAUVAIS is dead. 
HIROKO Can you handle it? 
URIOSTE Sure, I can manage.  But I'm not going into the Pit on my own. 
HIROKO   (to Urioste) Alright, get somebody from the auto-shop.   (to Kamen)   Is that alright? 
KAMEN Yeah, no problem.  Ask Diller, he's good with his hands. 
URIOSTE exchanges a grin with CASSIE. 
CASSIE I'll go along with that. 
A SHRILL TRILLING from his console communicator makes PARSONS leap up to answer. 
PARSONS Parsons.   (long beat)   Yeah.  Hold on. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY 
A CLOSE UP of an eye, bright blue and dilated.  DOC REVNA's shining a hand- held light into ACKLAND's face.  ACKLAND's regained consciousness, but is far from happy.  He's sitting on the edge of a cot in the base Infirmary, an antiseptic room full of automated medical equipment.  The Autodoc is suspended from the ceiling nearby, a circular cluster of sophisticated manipulator arms tipped with cutting blades and surgical paraphernalia. 
ACKLAND Hey, c'mon Doc, I feel fine.  Really. 
REVNA flicks off the probe. 
REVNA Headache?  Dehydration? 
ACKLAND The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack. 
REVNA Forget that.  I want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours. I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run. 
REVNA shakes her head and turns to KAMEN. 
REVNA (CONT'D) He's broken a fever that would kill a mule, but if he says he's alright I'm prepared to believe him.  He's all yours. 
HIROKO enters.  She watches from behind KAMEN. 
KAMEN What happened out there, Ack? 
ACKLAND   (consternated) What do you mean, 'what happened'?  What am I doing back here?  Where's York? 
HIROKO   (insistent) What's the last thing you can remember? 
ACKLAND thinks hard. 
ACKLAND We... watched a meteor hit over Linson's. 
HIROKO and KAMEN exchange significant glances. 
HIROKO A meteor? 
ACKLAND Yeah, it impacted really off.  We went out to the crash-site... and... uh... that's... that's all. 
DILLER straightens up, looking out into the surrounding trees.  It's a FAINT HUM, getting LOUDER every second. 
DILLER Yeah... 
A hoverbike appears, trailing smoke from one of it's turbine intakes as it hurtles towards the base.  Halfway between the trees and the ramp, it clips a fallen log and spins end-over-end.  It's rider flies through the air and hits the swamp face-first.  DILLER and CASSIE race down the ramp with BREWSTER YELPING excitedly in the lead. 
CASSIE I don't believe it. 
DILLER splashes through the swamp and pulls the limp body out of the mire. It's YORK.  Blood has caked around his wounded leg. 
DILLER He looks in a bad way.  Help me get him up to Infirmary. 
CASSIE Wait a minute... 
Something else has caught CASSIE's eye.  A "something" almost two metres in length protruding from the rear of the wrecked hoverbike. Grasping the haft firmly, she works it free.  CASSIE examines the PREDATOR spear, and slowly shakes her head. 
CASSIE (CONT'D) Holy Mary... 
PREDATOR-VISION. The concealed hunter watches as the colorised human curiously turns the weapon over in her hands. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY 
REVNA sits at a desk and peers into a microscope.  Every so often she GRUNTS in satisfaction and types something into her computer terminal. The stasis tube containing the dead FACEHUGGER stands to one side of the computer screen.  The Infirmary is very quiet, and only the gentle THROB of the air-conditioning intrudes.  ACKLAND tosses uncomfortably on his cot.  He finally sits up and massages his chest. 
ACKLAND Oh.  Oh God... 
REVNA lowers her pen and looks across. 
REVNA What is it? 
ACKLAND It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something. 
REVNA Do you want a tablet? 
ACKLAND winces in pain.  His breathing's getting heavy.  He nods. 
ACKLAND Uh-huh. 
REVNA gets up swiftly and crosses to an automated pharmacy.  ACKLAND's beginning to COUGH now. 
REVNA That sounds nasty.  I'll give you a couple of Demazine. 
ACKLAND nods again.  His COUGHING has deepened, and now he's banging his chest with a balled fist.  REVNA hurries over with three red tablets and a disposable cup of water.  ACKLAND takes them gratefully and gulps them down. The effect is almost immediate; ACKLAND quietens and an appreciative smile comes to his pale lips. 
REVNA (CONT'D) Better? 
ACKLAND Yeah... 
Before he has a chance to elaborate, ACKLAND COUGHS once more.  A thin spray of blood and saliva dots REVNA's white smock and speckles her cheek. ACKLAND's scrabbling fingers grab her lapels as he begins to hyperventilate. She pulls away, dragging him from the bed in the process.  He falls to the floor, his MOANS growing in volume. 
REVNA Hold on, it's alright.  I'm gonna give  you a shot... 
Her fingers tremble as she clumsily examines a tray of surgical instruments. She finds a pneumatic spray-injector, fully charged with a vial of amber liquid attached.  ACKLAND SCREAMS and fall backwards onto the floor, his hands clawing at the air.  REVNA fumbles with the injector control and gives him a blast in his upper arm.  ACKLAND convulses once then goes still, his eyes staring fixedly at the ceiling.  The Infirmary is deathly quiet once again. 
We hear a gentle CRACKING, like twigs being snapped.  REVNA watches in horrified fascination as a pool of blood spreads swiftly outward across the floor from below ACKLAND's corpse.  REVNA shudders as the body moves a little, then is rolled over by something underneath it. 
WHAT SHE SEES.  ACKLAND's body slumps forward onto it's front, revealing a gaping cavity in his back.  Bits of spine and ribcage are just visible.  A CHESTBURSTER - the second stage of the ALIEN lifeform - pulls itself clear and wipes red gunk from it's body with a pair of still-underdeveloped arms. 
Around it's head is a distinctive nascent crest.  It kicks away from ACKLAND with a powerful push from it's legs, quickly gaining balance. After a moment appraising it's new environment, it stalks off behind a table.  REVNA thinks quickly.  She leaps forward and THUMPS a large red stud next to the pressure-door, which promptly RUMBLES closed. 
The room is bathed in pools of shadows.  Plenty of hiding space for the creature.  REVNA hears breaking glass, making her start.  She cautiously edges over to the Autodoc and looks up into the forest of probe-arms. 
There's a wicked looking blade there, the kind used in major surgery. REVNA reaches up and twists the base; it detaches easily.  Now she's armed. Stooped over, she begins to stalk the CHESTBURSTER... 
There's a flurry of movement, and suddenly the hunter becomes the hunted. The CHESTBURSTER vaults from the table at her with a SHRILL SHRIEK, and REVNA blindly swings her make-shift knife in defense.  We hear a SIZZLE like frying bacon... 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY CORRIDOR 
HIROKO sprints down the corridor and reaches the Infirmary.  DILLER, CASSIE, and a few others are crowded around outside.  YORK lays unconscious on one of the medical trolleys next to the door, making access difficult.  Above them, a hinged flap on the wall lies open revealing a circular mechanism beneath.  BREWSTER scratches at the bulkhead and WHINES.  MUFFLED THUMPS come from within. 
HIROKO What happened? 
DILLER York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary. 
HIROKO   (astonished) York... 
HIROKO leans over to examine him, but a particularly loud CRASH from within the Infirmary distracts her. 
HIROKO (CONT'D) What's going on? 
CASSIE The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts. 
KAMEN claps the man on the shoulder to reassure him. 
KAMEN Don't worry about it, Yorkie.  You're safe now.  Go get come rest. 
YORK nods.  He gets to his feet and leaves the room.  HIROKO waits until the door slides shut behind him. 
HIROKO So, what do you think? 
KAMEN What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK 
It's late, and the base's exterior lighting casts yellow pools of light across the metal and concrete thoroughfares.  GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES - a tough-looking Afrikaan woman with a think accent - looks uneasily about them. Another GROUP of PEOPLE with trackers and guns are searching around in the BACKGROUND.  Nearby, the vertical yellow column of a suspension-crane gantry towers high above. 
DE VRIES C'mon, man.  One more sweep. 
GUTTIEREZ One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip. 
DE VRIES Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it? 
GUTTIEREZ Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this. 
DE VRIES pauses, listening to the sound from the surrounding forest. 
DE VRIES Listen to that... 
GUTTIEREZ cocks his head and listens.  He has no idea what she means. 
GUTTIEREZ Listen to what? 
DE VRIES That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural. 
GUTTIEREZ shivers in the wind as he looks out into the impenetrable blackness beyond the confines of the base. 
GUTTIEREZ De Vries? 
DE VRIES Yeah? 
GUTTIEREZ Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself. 
BREWSTER the dog stares in fascination at the rhinos through the meshwork fence of their pens.  The animals move around in agitation. Not at her, but at something else... 
DE VRIES Something spooking the rhinos? 
GUTTIEREZ I dunno. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - SWAMP LEVEL - DUSK 
PREDATOR-VISION. The rhino's, the dog, and the two humans can be seen way above on the platform's edge, bright red. 
Indistinct inside their camouflage cloaks, the small group of PREDATORS wade carefully through the water towards the base of the installation. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM 
DARKNESS.  DILLER and URIOSTE's VOICES heard O.S. in HUSHED TONES.  The scraping of METAL-ON-METAL. 
DILLER What is that...is that it? 
URIOSTE No.  I... think that's a regulator valve. Hold on. 
There's more NOISE. 
URIOSTE (CONT'D) Ah, got it...! 
About a dozen fluorescent strips ringing the small circular chamber illuminate.  Three others flicker erratically, one of them remaining unlit. DILLER waves the tracker cautiously around and keeps his pulse- rifle level. He enters, followed by URIOSTE.  She's carrying a portable - but bulky - piece of machinery. 
URIOSTE Are you getting anything? 
DILLER   (sarcastic) Yeah, eyestrain.  What's with the lights? 
URIOSTE They're always like that.  Head-Office are real cheap when it comes to spares.  Wave that thing in the corner... 
DILLER sweeps the tracker carefully around.  The small screen registers nothing. 
DILLER The room's clean. 
URIOSTE Great. 
URIOSTE pulls at a two-piece hexagonal grating set in the center of the floor.  It's heavy and thick with grease, but she doesn't seem to mind. Below it is what looks like a round metal plug.  Recessed into its surface is a lever next to a central pressure valve, with handholds on either side.  She turns the lever.  There's a loud CLUNK, and a plume of steam JETS out of the valve. 
URIOSTE (CONT'D) Give me a hand with this. 
GUTTIEREZ C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus. 
DE VRIES Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night. 
GUTTIEREZ starts to climb the ladder. 
DE VRIES What the hell are you doing? 
GUTTIEREZ Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself. 
DE VRIES runs her fingers through her hair in frustration.  Comes to a decision counter to what she wants to do... 
DE VRIES Wait a minute! 
GUTTIEREZ stops climbing. 
DE VRIES (CONT'D) Alright, okay.  Look... 
GUTTIEREZ What? 
DE VRIES I'll come with you. 
BREWSTER BARKS.  She drags the dog over to a metal stanchion and ties the leash around it. 
DE VRIES (CONT'D) But I'm going first... 
GUTTIEREZ Anything you say, Mammacitta. 
She climbs around GUTTIEREZ and begins to ascend the ladder.  BREWSTER WHIMPERS and plaintively BARKS after them. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK 
The rooftop is dark, mysterious.  Pieces of retrofitted junk can be seen in silhouette, edged in light from way below.  DE VRIES and GUTTIEREZ carefully step over the threshold.  They speak in WHISPERS. 
DE VRIES Careful of that edging there... 
GUTTIEREZ Yeah, I got it. 
Although we have an outstanding VIEW of the night lights of the base up here, the immediate gloom is impenetrable. 
DE VRIES Where's that flashlight? 
By way of an answer, a powerful ray cuts a swathe through the air.  DE VRIES takes the torch from him and shines it on the ground.  Circular extractor fans rotate quietly in the gloom. 
DE VRIES (CONT'D) Still got him? 
GUTTIEREZ It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left. 
DE VRIES plays the flashlight across the rooftop. 
GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D) Little bit further... 
The beam comes to rest on a protruding piece of apparatus.  A short- range antennae, about seven feet wide. 
GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right there, right behind the antennae.  I think we're got it cornered... 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK 
HIROKO bends down to inspect a small plastic grating fitted flush with the roadway.  The broken grillework is melted outwards.  KAMEN and two other men - CALDWELL and THOMAS - stand behind. 
THOMAS The door to the food storage locker was smashed open.  It must have come straight out of here. 
HIROKO yawns. 
HIROKO Alright.  Keep your eyes peeled. 
She voices her concern to KAMEN. 
HIROKO (CONT'D) If it got out of the systems, it could be anywhere. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK 
It's very quiet, and we can hear the NERVOUS BREATHING of GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES as they cautiously stalk forward. 
GUTTIEREZ Hold it, hold it... 
DE VRIES What's wrong? 
GUTTIEREZ I'm picking up another signal. 
DE VRIES looks around, unnerved. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM 
DILLER crosses to the wall-mounted winch.  On the mechanism's side is a luminous digital counter giving the current cable depth in meters.  He pulls a throw-switch, and the display slowly changes from "8" to "9.5" as the cable feeds out. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT 
URIOSTE descends the dingy shaft, partially abseiling off the walls. Her feet almost tread water.  She's down as far as she can go. 
URIOSTE (CONT'D) Whoa, whoa... 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM 
URIOSTE's VOICE echoes up out of the pit. 
URIOSTE (CONT'D)  (O.S., muffled) That's enough. 
DILLER locks the winch-switch back into it's 'up' position.  The WHINE of the cable-feed stops immediately. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT 
URIOSTE stretches out to the floating lamp, flexing her fingers. It's... just... about... in... reach... 
Six slender fingers EXPLODE from beneath the water's surface and clamp like a vise around URIOSTE's wrist.  A sleek eyeless head follows, trailing a body straight out of a charnel-house nightmare.  A SCREAM forms in her throat, rapidly cut-off as the ALIEN's other hand clamps firmly over her mouth, jerking her downwards. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM 
DILLER whirls in response to the CHOKED CRY from below.  He sees the winch tripod above the shaft RATTLE, the cable going taut as an angler's line. The wall-mounted drum is yanked so hard the lever leaps from it's 'clamped' position, freely unspooling cable at a frightening rate.  The digital counter flickers rapidly; "11...11.5...12...12.5...13..."  DILLER watches the tripod's tubular legs buckle and collapse under the tremendous strain.  He scrambles for the winch-lever and only just manages to lock it firmly into place; the over-stressed cable vibrating with a LOW METALLIC TWANG as it hits the shaft's edge.  DILLER's moment of satisfaction is short-lived; the deep-sunk bolts attaching the mechanism to the wall are pull outward by the colossal force from below.  He leaps aside, avoiding the heavy piece of machinery as it HURTLES towards him.  Watches it disappear noisily into the conduit. 
DILLER Annie! 
DILLER's quivering fingers grope for his flashlight. 
DILLER (CONT'D) Annie! 
He feverishly reaches the shaft's edge and peers into the darkness. 
WHAT HE SEES.  The torchbeam picks out the biomechanical form of the ALIEN emerging from the sewage and effortlessly climbing the shaft walls towards him.  Recoiling in horror, he makes a run for the door. Half-way there he remembers his pulse-rifle and dives to the floor, grasping it just as the ALIEN reaches the top.  DILLER fumbles with the safety and give the creature a full BLAST on rock-and-roll, BLASTING it back into the pit. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK 
GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES hear the gunfire from below. 
GUTTIEREZ The hell was that? 
PREDATOR-VISION. The PREDATOR's gaze SNAPS away from the two humans and down onto the platform below.  He watches the infra-red shapes of other people running towards the source of the shots... 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM 
DILLER's on his feet and shakily heading for the exit as ANOTHER ALIEN's claws emerge from the exposed hole.  He races across the threshold and SLAMS the thin inner door closed. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK 
In a HAND-HELD SHOT we're running with HIROKO's group along the narrow catwalk bridging the roadway to the Pump Room, KAMEN taking the lead. DILLER sprints out of the building like a bat out of hell and collides with him. 
KAMEN Kev, wha...? 
DILLER breaks free of the other man's grasp.  He looks as if he's about to say something, but never gets the chance. 
There's a sound of TEARING METAL, and a HISSING seven-foot express train of teeth and biomechanical limbs ERUPTS from the shadows. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK 
PREDATOR-VISION. Gazing down at the platform, an unseen hunter watches the swift black SHAPE of the ALIEN in amongst the group of humans... 
From the corner of her eye, DE VRIES sees something moving nearby.  She violently pulls GUTTIEREZ out of the path of the shimmering FORM that barges past them, launching itself from the rooftop. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER 
PARSONS sits bolt upright in his chair as the scene outside is relayed to his bank of screens by an exterior securi-cam. 
PARSONS Oh my God... 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK 
With superhuman strength, the ALIEN brutally back-hands DILLER, splintering his skull and killing him instantly.  His body caromes into THOMAS, knocking the man to the floor.  The ALIEN turns to KAMEN, it's questing fingers closing around his throat and hauling him off the ground.  The space on the catwalk it limited; there's so many people it's impossible to get a clean shot... 
HIROKO Move!  Get out of the way! 
HIROKO draws a bead on the ALIEN.  She flips off the safety on her rifle. It's the tiniest CLICK, but the ALIEN somehow senses danger. It's skeletal tail lashes out, sending both her and the weapon flying. CALDWELL gets in for his shot, but the tail's there in a second.  It strikes like a snake. Once.  Twice.  The stinger punctures CALDWELL's chest and throat.  Nobody could survive something like that... 
The ALIEN flicks it's skull back around to KAMEN.  The man's head is inches away from it's eyeless face...a row of burnished metal teeth open...the toothed inner tongue ready to strike... 
THOMAS grabs CALDWELL's rifle from the deck.  He races towards GUTTIEREZ, with DE VRIES close behind... 
THOMAS Catch this! 
From behind comes the SOUND of more rupturing plastic as biomechanoid limbs struggle up out of newly-broken ducts.  THOMAS heaves the rifle over the heads of the emerging ALIENS.  Although GUTTIEREZ snags it awkwardly, he quickly turns the barrel on the relentless creatures. 
GUTTIEREZ Chew on this! 
DE VRIES races up to join them, SCREAMING as she fires.  KAMEN glances down at this tracker's tiny screen.  It shows clusters of signals, lots of them. 
KAMEN   (hollering) They're all around, they're in the drainage system! 
DE VRIES reacts swiftly, loosing a round of shots at the emerging ALIENS. GUTTIEREZ yells across to KAMEN. 
GUTTIEREZ Get your ass out of here, boss! 
ALIENS are appearing everywhere.  From the overflow ducts; over the platform edges; along overhead cable supports.  Having taken on the genetic characteristics of their hosts, many of them are non-humanoid. All of them are living nightmares. 
HIROKO Oh my God... 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - LIVING QUARTERS 
CASSIE brushes her teeth in front of the wall-mounted mirror of her tiny bathroom-cubicle.  A raucous emergency klaxon GOES OFF in the corridor outside. 
CASSIE Shit. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK 
THOMAS, GUTTIEREZ, and DE VRIES are cut-off.  As they race swiftly down the street, GUTTIEREZ tries hard to interpret his tracker's signals.  A particularly loud BLEEP registers from a source immediately behind them.  He glances over his shoulder and sees an ALIEN crawling down the outside of a module towards them. 
GUTTIEREZ De Vries! 
DE VRIES' head turns.  She sees the ALIEN and nails it with a rapid burst. It falls onto the concrete nearby, writhing in it's death throes. 
The group round the corner of a building.  Across the street from them is parked KAMEN's crawler. 
GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D) Inside, inside! 
They scramble up into the cab.  GUTTIEREZ throws himself into the driver's seat.  An ALIEN sprints at the crawler with bared teeth. THOMAS looses a shot, blasting it backward into a Pepsi sign. 
THOMAS Yo' momma, boneface! 
DE VRIES   (to Guttierez) C'mon, man; punch this cow! 
GUTTIEREZ fumbles at the ignition.  They keys are there.  He flips them, and the engine GROWLS to life. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - DUSK 
PREDATOR-VISION. From way up here, we've got an outstanding view of the humans running across the platform... 
Crouching on a bright-yellow catwalk, BROKEN TUSK presses closed a panel on the small container balanced on his knee.  Inside it are rows of metal instruments with a pristine surgical quality about them. BROKEN TUSK flexes his hand experimentally.  Satisfied, he clips the medical kit onto his back before getting to his feet. 
Standing around him are several other PREDATORS.  All but one have their camouflage cloaks activated.  The SOUND of GUNFIRE way across the station draws their attention... 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK 
HIROKO and KAMEN bolt towards an external hatch, with KAMEN laying down a field of covering fire on full-automatic.  The blaze of light from the rifle's barrel abruptly stops. 
HIROKO What? 
KAMEN I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside! 
HIROKO hears a HORRIBLE NOISE nearby.  A field of cows being slaughtered by machetes would sound like this. 
HIROKO They're in with the rhino! 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - RHINO PEN - DUSK 
An ALIEN is SMASHED sideways into the one solid wall of the pen, broadsided and instantly crushed by a ton of FRENZIED rhino.  It's yellow blood eats into the weighty quadruped, eliciting ANGUISHED BELLOWS of pain from the hapless creature. 
ALIEN stingers slice through the air.  Rhinos try to bolt but are intercepted by inhumanly powerful forces.  It's wholesale carnage. 
PREDATOR-VISION. We're moving swiftly along the rooftops and surveying the melee below, lessening the distance with each second... 
Several indefinable FIGURES plunge into the fray, creating anarchy within the ALIENS' ranks.  The biomechanoids HISS with fury as the PREDATORS join battle against them... 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK 
An ALIEN hurls itself through the air and onto the speeding crawler's roof. 
INT.  CRAWLER - DUSK 
GUTTIEREZ is desperately trying to operate the tiny plastic microswitches on the headset with his fingernails. 
GUTTIEREZ What? 
THOMAS We've got company! 
THOMAS brings his weapon to bear and pulls on the trigger.  He gets off one shot, then nothing more happens.  He looks at the counter on the side.  It reads 'zero'. 
THOMAS (CONT'D) Shit, I'm dry!  You're up! 
DE VRIES raises her rifle.  She aims, and... 
CLICK. 
DE VRIES I'm jammed! 
THOMAS You're what?! 
She works the manual slide. 
DE VRIES It's locked solid... 
THOMAS Quick, give me the clip! 
DE VRIES fumbles the ammunition clip from her rifle.  It falls from her hands onto a plastic overflow grate.  THOMAS leaps after it...about a second too late.  It slips through the narrow gap, gone for good. 
THOMAS (CONT'D) Oh, Lord!  Please, no!  Not now! 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE 
HIROKO enters her office at a run.  She crosses to an inset control box on the far wall and presses a button.  Two exterior panels begin to slide closed behind the polycarbonate window. 
KERSMASH!  Fracture lines appear on the toughened plastic as it comes under assault from the razor-edge tip of an ALIEN's tail.  In shock, HIROKO reflexively falls backwards onto the floor, scrambling away. She watches the creature precariously balancing on the this ledge outside, fighting against the closing shutters with simultaneously raining repeated blows on the window with it's tail. 
The ALIEN leaps through the gap as the window gives way under the onslaught, showering splinters across the room.  The twin shutters secure behind it, closing on the creatures tail in the process.  It HISSES in indignation and thrashes about.  Like a lizard, the segmented tail SNAPS in two.  The freed ALIEN staggers a little before gaining balance, blood dripping from the laceration and penetrating the wooden floorboards.  It sights HIROKO and hurls itself in her direction, an unstoppable killing machine... 
HIROKO Holo on! 
Her VOICE quavers so badly with fear and panic, it's a wonder the computer can recognize it.  FOUR NINJA SWORDSMEN promptly appear, forming a semi-circle between HIROKO and the ALIEN.  The ALIEN halts, confused by this intrusion. It swipes at the pre-programmed holograms, bewildered by the lack of contact as it's claws pass through them. 
Gaining on a few seconds of bought time, HIROKO flings herself towards the PREDATOR spear lying forgotten nearby.  The ALIEN locks in on this sudden movement and charges through the holograms at her.  HIROKO GRUNTS, swinging the spear with her full strength... 
She's no super-athlete, but the cutting edge's advanced metallurgy does the job.  It slices half-way through the ALIEN's skull and sticks there, spewing yellow fluid everywhere.  HIROKO beats a hasty retreat as the dying biomechanoid falls to the floor, fumbling at the lodged weapon... 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS 
HIROKO reels into the outside corridor.  She SHRIEKS as her shoulders are seized from behind... 
KAMEN Come on! 
HIROKO looks at KAMEN confusedly as he continues along the corridor. 
HIROKO That's the wrong way! 
KAMEN Detour.  Other way's blocked... 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK 
Back outside, the ALIENS have sensed that something's amiss.  DE VRIES turns desperately to GUTTIEREZ. 
DE VRIES You got any slugs left? 
GUTTIEREZ looks down at the counter on his slung weapon. 
GUTTIEREZ Yeah.  Uh... 
DE VRIES rips the weapon off his shoulder.  GUTTIEREZ completes his sentence. 
GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D) ...Seven. 
BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  DE VRIES tries to make each shot count.  She sights an ALIEN crawling across the top of a group of cylindrical storage containers. Draws a bead on the metal tank and fires... 
A molten ball EXPLODES outward, transforming the immediate vicinity into a blazing inferno.  The ALIEN's body twists end-over-end, remaining immobile as it hits the deck.  A curtain of fire ripples across the platform... 
THOMAS Yes! 
Their victory is short-lived.  The other ALIENS crawl cautiously forward, flames licking their faces but leaving them unharmed.  We can clearly hear the HISSING of their internal jaws. 
DE VRIES Try again, man... 
The headset in GUTTIEREZ' hand BLEEPS as it turns into the correct channel. He YELLS into it... 
YORK Hurry up, we're losing it! 
CASSIE's eyes widen in terror... 
CASSIE Behind you! 
HIROKO turns to see the long, phallic head of an ALIEN emerge momentarily from out of the foam.  Something yanks at KAMEN and he disappears beneath the surface with an expression of pained surprise... 
HIROKO Kamen! 
HIROKO starts to thrash at the foam, but CASSIE reaches out and drags her away. 
CASSIE It's too late! 
HIROKO Nooooo! 
The chair begins to buckle, collapsing in on itself... 
YORK It's going! 
With a supreme effort, CASSIE yanks HIROKO through the gap.  YORK vaults clear as the chair SNAPS in two, leaving the bulkhead to THUNDER closed. The two women collapse in a heap on the floor. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK 
The battle outside is going badly for the PREDATORS.  There's only three of them left, and one is BROKEN TUSK. 
A projectile WHISTLES through the air towards an ALIEN, expanding in flight into a wire capture net.  Barbed tips on each corner bite into the wall of a base module, trapping the enraged creature.  Small motors WHINE as the thin metal pulls inward, slicing into the ALIEN's body... 
The PREDATOR savors the scene for just a second...which is a second too long. ALIENS are all over him, clawing and ripping at his body.  The shoulder-mounted plasma-cannon is unceremoniously yanked away and CLATTERS to the floor. 
The PREDATOR goes down, groping for the self-destruct system on his wrist. He manages to stroke a fingernail across the activation bar, but gets no further.  An ALIEN pounces at him, it's tail descending.  The PREDATOR raises his arm in reflex, but the stinger SMASHES straight through the buries it in his face-plate, taking out the wrist-computer in the process. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER 
HIROKO stares at the closed bulkhead with an expression of dazed disbelief. 
PARSONS Miss Noguchi? 
No reaction.  He tries again. 
PARSONS (CONT'D) Miss Noguchi! 
HIROKO snaps out of it.  She crosses over to the bank of monitoring screens. 
HIROKO What's the story? 
PARSONS runs through each of the screens. 
PARSONS Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate. 
HIROKO How many... how many people are missing? 
CASSIE Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place. 
HIROKO What's our weapons situation? 
DRISCOLL - a big guy with a beard - LAUGHS curtly. 
DRISCOLL Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it. 
HIROKO Auto-shop? 
CASSIE Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off. 
HIROKO Has anybody talked to them? 
CASSIE Not yet. 
HIROKO Do it. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOPS - DUSK 
BROKEN TUSK and the other PREDATOR scramble up onto the rooftop in a bid to escape their unstoppable opponents.  Back-to-back, they take up fighting positions.  A few seconds later, the first of the ALIENS arrives. 
Both the PREDATORS' shoulder cannons blaze, firing volley-after-volley. Still the ALIENS keep on coming, finally reaching the point where it's hand-to-hand...and nothing else. 
It's a vicious, fast, and bloody on both sides.  BROKEN TUSK takes flight; his companion is not as lucky.  The other PREDATOR kicks an ALIEN from him and over the roof's edge.  The ALIEN lashes out with lightning-fast reflexes, pulling the PREDATOR with it.  Both creatures hurtle downward and hit a nest of cabling stretched across from one of the modules.  Caught like flies in a spider's web.  Both thrash about, severing cables as they do.  Electrical sparks CRACKLE through the air... 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER 
Everything electrical in the Command Center flickers momentarily, and the bank of monitors turn to static.  There's an instant of silence collective concerns amongst those gathered there. 
MATT walks nervously around, holding the headset.  Everybody's eyes are on him. 
MATT Well, it occurred to me that we could use the overhead crane to load the admin module onto the back of Big Bertha.  That way we could put a bit of distance... 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER 
MATT (CONT'D)   (O.S., on speakers) ...Between us and the station.  Least 'till the guys from Fort Powell arrive. 
HIROKO That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here? 
DRISCOLL Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running. 
HIROKO Which mean physically going outside. 
DRISCOLL looks around uneasily. 
DRISCOLL Yeah. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LOWER DECK 
A small group of people, most of whom we saw in the Command Center, are clustered around a section of the poorly-lit maintenance corridor. HIROKO's wearing a black hi-tech catsuit, a fetishist's dream.  Across her shoulder is a pistol in a slung bandolier holster.  She nods at a pile of clothing in DRISCOLL's hands. 
HIROKO Is this the suit? 
DRISCOLL Uh-huh. 
She takes it from him.  Slides her legs into the bottom half and pulls it up.  YORK watches with an expression of incredulity etched on his face. 
YORK This is fuckin' lunacy!  You're not gonna make it across the platform on foot! 
CASSIE Shut up, York. 
HIROKO No, he's right.  Has anyone got a bike near here? 
A REDHEADED GIRL looks around hesitantly, then raises her voice. 
REDHEADED GIRL I have. 
HIROKO Let me have the keys. 
The GIRL rummages in her pockets and throws the keys over.  HIROKO puts them in a pocket on the suit's sleeve. 
HIROKO (CONT'D) Which one is it? 
REDHEADED GIRL Uh... the Hyundai racer.  Yellow and black stripes. 
YORK Oh, yeah.  Real inconspicuous... 
HIROKO Listen, I don't care if it's pink and purple polka-dots as long as it gets me there in one piece.  Somebody loan me a headset. 
CASSIE pulls off hers and hands it over.  DRISCOLL's watching HIROKO fasten up the suit.  He spots a mistake. 
DRISCOLL No, go back.  Second clasp from the bottom. 
HIROKO finds the offending clasp and locks it. 
HIROKO How much air-time have I got? 
CASSIE About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery. 
HIROKO Deal. 
CASSIE We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go. 
DRISCOLL Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display. 
HIROKO Sounds great. 
PARSONS It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind. 
HIROKO What?  Why? 
DRISCOLL We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick. 
HIROKO How tight are these shafts? 
CASSIE and DRISCOLL exchange worried looks. 
CASSIE Tight.  We chose a route we felt would reduce the chance of you running into any Aliens. 
HIROKO takes a deep breath.  Beads of perspiration dot her forehead. PARSONS nods. 
The heavy sealing-plug is dragged across the grating and positioned over the hole.  YORK shakes his head. 
YORK Suicide run, man.  Fuckin' suicide run. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - VENTURI DUCT 
CASSIE wasn't kidding about the venturi-duct.  It's only about half- again as wide as HIROKO.  The only illumination comes from the hazy circle above.  As the plug reseals the hole, even that's gone. 
Something flickers.  Two weak fluorescent tubes come on, lighting the murk with a faint orange haze. 
CASSIE   (O.S. on speakers) All the comforts of home. 
HIROKO Thanks, Cassie. 
CASSIE   (O.S., on speakers) Don't mention it. 
She inches her way through the narrow space towards us, breathing heavily. The CLICKING of the motion-tracker in her helmet is overwhelming in the  silence... 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ANTENNA ARRAY - NIGHT 
The station's massive antenna array is being transformed.  Otherworldly shapes comprised of surreal creatures and protrusions are starting to cover it's surface.  ALIENS drop from dizzying heights, exuding streams of gelatinous gunk from the four 'exhaust' pipes on their backs. They're building a nest of staggering proportions. 
Unnoticed by the busy biomechanoids, faint sparks flicker from the crane catwalk high above... 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT 
BROKEN TUSK sits on the catwalk floor, a small shower of sparks lighting his face.  He's attempting to repair his broken wrist computer with an intricate tool.  He removes it and presses a switch.  The display glows briefly, then fades.  He inserts it again.  Electrical sparks CRACKLE across the computer's fascia, before burning out. BROKEN TUSK throws the ruined machine away in disgust. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP 
From our P.O.V. high up near the roof of the auto-shop we see THOMAS sitting on the raised hydraulic platform.  He GRUNTS as he pulls a valve on the crawler's underside. 
Across the room, the second crawler RUMBLES out of the far bay.  One of the GREASE MONKEYS walks slowly backwards, waving it on. 
GREASE MONKEY Okay.  Back.  Back.  Little bit more... 
He steps into a pool of slippery residue and loses his footing. 
GREASE MONKEY (CONT'D) Whoa...shit! 
The man crouches and runs a finger through the colorless goo on the floor. Scowls first, then frowns.  It's sticky. 
Over near the doors, MATT exhales deeply on a cigarette.  DE VRIES is nearby, listening attentively as GUTTIEREZ gets a message on his helmet. 
GUTTIEREZ She just set off! 
MATT claps his hands together - just once - to get everybody's attention. 
MATT Okay, people.  Let's hustle... 
There's a SCREAM from behind.  They wheel around in time to see the GREASE MONKEY being tugged into the maintenance opening.  THOMAS yells down from the platform. 
THOMAS They're comin' up through the pit! 
A box with two large buttons - one green, one red - dangles from the ceiling on the end of a cable.  MATT forces down the red control, making the platform lower.  Several tons of machinery and crawler bring about the demise of the ALIENS as they reach the lip of the opening, CRUSHING their chitinous limbs to smithereens. 
An ALIEN rolls out of the pit in time, scrambling for the safety of the nearby shadows.  DE VRIES sights it. 
DE VRIES Over there! 
One of the MEN has seen it.  His head snaps up to a mammoth engine- block suspended from a winch high above.  He LEAPS for the release- catch as the ALIEN passes underneath.  Pulls hard on the grip.  Chains RATTLE noisily as the block THUNDERS down.  The ALIEN begins to look up, just a second too late.  The heavy piece of machinery SMASHES into the creature, flattening it instantly. 
Unseen by anybody, another ALIEN has escaped to the roof of the platform-bound crawler.  It wraps it's long, bony fingers around the face of the MAN, stifling his CRIES and pulling him off the deck.  The LOUD CLATTERING of his chainsaw bouncing off the floor-grating gets THOMAS' attention. 
THOMAS Mother-fucker! 
THOMAS retrieves the fallen tool and jams the 'on' switch hard.  The ALIEN's tongue shoots through the GREASE MONKEY's skull, showering THOMAS with a faint speckling of blood.  The ALIEN discards the body and lunges at THOMAS, who counters bringing the chainsaw up. 
The blade slices into the creature's throat, and up through it's head. THOMAS draws out the chainsaw quickly.  Something happens to the PITCH of the blade, a peculiar sound... 
The acid eats through the links of the chainsaw band.  Like a metallic snake, it WHIPS off it's supporting frame. 
Straight at THOMAS.

HIROKO runs back across the catwalk.  She might have missed the PREDATOR's damaged computer before, but she doesn't this time.  Her foot comes down on it and she slips.  The gun goes flying from her hand.  HIROKO watches in horror as it teeters on the catwalk's edge for a moment... 
HIROKO No! 
...Then goes over.  She drops to all fours and peers over the side. Luckily it's only fallen about four feet onto a dirty ledge.  She reaches out for it... 
INT.  FIRST CRAWLER CAB 
GUTTIEREZ pushes forward on the crawler's controls.  The head-up display projected on the cab windscreen changes from 'NEUTRAL' to 'DRIVE'. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT 
The two crawlers TEAR OUT of the auto-shop's opening doors, headlights blazing. 
INT.  FIRST CRAWLER CAB - NIGHT 
GUTTIEREZ braces himself as they speed on a collision course towards the ditched crawler they left outside auto-shop earlier. 
GUTTIEREZ Shit! 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT 
KER-SMASM!  GUTTIEREZ' crawler rams the other vehicle off the roadway and through the platform safety barrier.  It balances precariously for a second, until finally it's weight sends it plunging into the swamp in a CACOPHONY of STRESSED METAL and CRUMBLING CONCRETE. 
INT.  SECOND CRAWLER CAB - NIGHT 
MATT Yee-haa!  Demolition derby, baby! 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT 
Holding the cracked mask to his face, BROKEN TUSK looks up at the gigantic crane moving against the night sky. 
PREDATOR VISION. Although the helmet's nightsight is malfunctioning, it's still good enough to register the 'hot' infra-red shape of HIROKO on the catwalk. 
The sound of the two crawlers hurtling across the platform gets BROKEN TUSK's attention. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT 
HIROKO gets a firm grasp on one of the railing rungs, anchoring herself. Stretches for the pistol with renewed determination.  She brushes the barrel. Not good enough.  Tries again.  Success!  Her fingers curl around the weapon, and she tugs it upwards. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT 
GUTTIEREZ begins climbing the tall ladder running up to the Bertha's cab. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT 
HIROKO's running along the platform, pistol clenched firmly in hand. She thumbs her headset. 
HIROKO Rob, it's Hiroko.  Come in. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER 
CASSIE answers, holding on to the edge of her console. 
CASSIE Hiroko, it's Cassie.  What's... 
HIROKO's VOICE interrupts. 
HIROKO   (O.S., on speakers) I've lost the bike and I'm cut-off. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT 
HIROKO spins around the corner, pointing her gun cop-stance. 
HIROKO (CONT'D) If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER 
CASSIE But... 
EXT. RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT 
The heli-jet pad's just up ahead.  The relief on HIROKO's face is enormous. 
HIROKO No 'buts'.  Just do it.  Noguchi out. 
INT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT 
GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES pile inside the surprisingly cramped driver's cab. There's a seat up-front, with another behind a small control fascia pointing out-back.  DE VRIES hands over her rifle and slides into the rear.  She flicks on an overhead light.  Taped to one side is a black-and-white magazine cut-out of a naked male body-builder. 
DE VRIES Nice buns... 
She gives the control board a cursory once-over.  GUTTIEREZ calls back from his vantage point at the doorway. 
GUTTIEREZ Can you handle it? 
DE VRIES powers-up the console. 
DE VRIES Piece of cake. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - NIGHT 
HIROKO runs towards the waiting heli-jet.  The flicker of an andrenalin-fueled smile plays on her face...the disappears. 
Like a scorpion scuttling over a rock, the ALIEN climbs up on top of the grounded machine.  It's head turn towards her.  HIROKO starts to raise her pistol... then stops.  Other ALIENS are descending the nearby navigation tower... straight for her. 
HIROKO turns tail.  She races over to a ladder running up the side of a building and begins to climb. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT 
The shadow of the crane and it's cargo falls over Big Bertha's rear flatbed. Flashing warning strobes illuminate the twin hydraulic arms which rise up to meet it. 
INT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT 
DE VRIES twists on the 'waldo' controls operating the manipulator hands. 
EXT.  SWAMP - NIGHT 
ALIENS rise up out of the swamp below, and start to scale Bertha's balloon tires. 
INT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT 
GUTTIEREZ fires a barrage down at the oncoming creatures.  He HOLLERS back to DE VRIES. 
GUTTIEREZ Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones! 
DE VRIES Couple more seconds! 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT 
HIROKO takes flight across the rooftops with the ALIENS in pursuit like a pack of dogs.  She vaults extractor intakes and retrofitted junk with ease. So do the ALIENS. 
She cuts across a conduit overpass bridging two buildings across the main street, trying not to lose her footing.  Just before reaching the other side, HIROKO slips and falls to her knees.  Her headset drops thirty feet onto the concrete roadway.  Her hand rests on something red.  It's the cover for the explosive bolts connecting the conduit to the building.  She scrambles onto the rooftop and flips over the hatch. Glances up.  The ALIENS are already starting across.  She pulls the primer cylinder out by it's handle.  Jams it into the detonator, and turns... 
She races across to the rail and gazes downward. 
HIROKO'S P.O.V. The PREDATOR wades through the swamp towards something she cannot see. HIROKO looks around the platform.  She's suddenly very alone. 
HIROKO (CONT'D) Shit! 
She crosses to a maintenance ladder and begins to descend. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - SWAMP LEVEL - NIGHT 
HIROKO SPLASHES through the swamp towards the PREDATOR.  BROKEN TUSK has paused before a culvert nestled within the shadows of the platform piers, running directly out into the swamp.  Most of the drain is underwater, with only about eight inches protruding from the water. The thick metal grille covering it is mangled and twisted.  Broken from within. 
HIROKO (CONT'D) You've got to be joking.  No way am I going back in there! 
No joke.  BROKEN TUSK starts submerging to get across inside. 
HIROKO (CONT'D) Hey! 
BROKEN TUSK pauses for a moment.  He gives her a look, then disappears into the blackness.  HIROKO looks around.  It's no fun being the last person left alive here. 
HIROKO (CONT'D) Goddammit! 
She takes several deep breaths, then reluctantly follows... 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CULVERT 
HIROKO emerges within an air pocket inside the drain.  She shivers. It's just as dirty and cramped as she remembers.  Several of the maintenance lights down here are broken, and visibility is minimal. 
HIROKO (CONT'D)   (quietly) Wha...? 
BROKEN TUSK whirls, and clamps a hand across her mouth.  She gets the message. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR 
They exit the culvert through another smashed grate.  HIROKO finds herself back in the Central Reservoir again.  She wades through the water behind BROKEN TUSK, holding the spear above her head.  The two of them look very vulnerable in here.  They pass beneath the PULSATING SAC HIROKO saw earlier. It looks riper now, ready to burst.  An INSIDIOUS PULSING NOISE - like a heartbeat - gains in volume the further they travel. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER 
They come out in a chamber some forty feet in height and dominated by an enormous pump.  ALIEN gunk covers everything. 
HIROKO gasps.  High above it a QUEEN ALIEN, nesting on top of the vast mechanism.  It's EGG SAC drapes around the pump; spiraling down around it. She seems to be asleep. 
BROKEN TUSK ignores the QUEEN.  His eyes are searching the multitude of forms - human and otherwise - cocooned into the walls.  He finds what he's looking for.  Up on one wall is another PREDATOR.  Dead.  It's stomach blown open. 
HIROKO holds her spear tightly.  FACEHUGGERS pulse malignantly, wrapped around several trapped victims.  A number of empty EGGS are scattered here-and-there. 
BROKEN TUSK looks around.  No ALIENS.  He begins climbing the organic fresco, watching the QUEEN ALIEN carefully for signs of awareness.  The bellows-like SOUND of her BREATHING is overwhelming.  He reaches the entrapped PREDATOR. It's left arm is encased in a solidified mass of secreted resin.  BROKEN TUSK raises his 'smart weapon' and activates it. 
The SPLINTERING NOISE makes HIROKO wince.  She glances up at the QUEEN. It's breathing start to change, and it's head moves... 
BROKEN TUSK sees it too.  He hesitates for a moment.  The QUEEN settles, and her breathing goes back to normal.  BROKEN TUSK resumes his work, chipping off the final chunk of coating.  He sheathes the 'smart weapon', and flips open the other PREDATOR's wrist device.  He withdraws the small manipulator device we saw earlier, and goes to work... 
DOWN BELOW, HIROKO's backing away.  She doesn't see the arm coated in slime that grasps at her hair.  She shudders, stifling a SCREAM.  Her eyes are wide as she turns... 
It's KAMEN.  He's been embedded into the biomechanical frieze.  When he speaks, his voice is wracked with pain and suffering. 
KAMEN Hiroko... 
HIROKO fearfully says something beneath her breath in JAPANESE. 
UP ON THE WALL, BROKEN TUSK has finished his task.  He slides the tip of a claw across the self-destruct mechanism.  It's readout display illuminates with alien characters.  He activates a button, and the readout begins to blink... 
BELOW, KAMEN is talking to a sickened HIROKO. 
KAMEN (CONT'D) They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next. 
HIROKO What can I do? 
KAMEN I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me. 
HIROKO I... I can't! 
KAMEN You have to... 
HIROKO No! 
BROKEN TUSK appears as HIROKO's shoulder.  He raises his right arm. SCHNICK! The wrist knives slice outwards.  Red blood SPATTERS HIROKO's pale face. BROKEN TUSK grabs her arm roughly and pulls her away. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR 
BROKEN TUSK pushes HIROKO through the reservoir.  An ALIEN EGG on a nearby wall PEELS OPEN.  Before the FACEHUGGER even has a chance to spring, BROKEN TUSK swings his wrist-blades in a wide arc, cutting through the EGG and it's writhing contents. 
BROKEN TUSK SMASHES his foot hard into the face of an ALIEN.  A BLAST of displaced air hits him like a sledgehammer.  He turns... 
HIROKO's heli-jet hovers stationary just a few feet away from the tower, the door on the co-pilot's side flapping open.  She HOLLERS at the PREDATOR over the ROAR of the engines. 
HIROKO C'mon!  Jump! 
BROKEN TUSK looks down.  It's a long drop...but it's the best option available to him.  He jumps. 
THWACK!  His hands grip the door frame.  The heli-jet wobbles slightly, it's center of gravity shifting.  BROKEN TUSK hauls himself up and through the door as... 
...KER-BLAM!  A massive explosion mushrooms up from the base as the storage tanks below ignite.  The shock wave buffets the chopper against the tower. 
INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN 
BROKEN TUSK's P.O.V. The grinning face of the young QUEEN gets suddenly closer as the heli- jet is propelled towards the metal structure. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - NAVIGATION TOWER - PRE-DAWN 
CRUNCH!  The chopper hits, knocking several ALIENS from their handholds.  One of the QUEEN's arms SHOOTS OUT, wrapping itself around the port engine mount. 
INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN 
HIROKO pushes on the stick.  The heli-jet pulls away...then tilts violently to one side, engines desperately trying to compensate. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN 
The QUEEN is hanging from the beleaguered craft, it's weight drawing it slowly down.  In the BACKGROUND, the Navigation Tower begins to slowly collapse. 
INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN 
HIROKO wrestles the overtaxed controls. 
HIROKO Shit! 
BROKEN TUSK turns towards her. 
HIROKO (CONT'D) In the back!  In the back! 
The PREDATOR may not understand her words, but he can follow the frantic jerking of her hand.  He twists around to look in the chopper's rear. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN 
HIROKO pilots the heli-jet over the station's storage tanks.  The conflagration below has gotten completely out-of-hand. 
EXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN 
The QUEEN is starting to struggle up, it's arms flailing for purchase. 
INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN 
BROKEN TUSK pulls out a pulse-rifle from the rear.  He quickly takes stock of it. 
HIROKO Watch your shots!  If you hit the engine you'll blow us both to hell! 
BROKEN TUSK goes for the trigger.  His index finger won't slide into the trigger guard...it's too big!  He takes the guard in both hands and exerts pressure.  SNAP.  Problem solved. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER 
BLEEP!  There's only one set of digits left on the destruct device's display counter. 
EXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN 
A red dot of light runs across the QUEEN's head.  She must sense it somehow. Her head comes round to bear... 
BROKEN TUSK's got the pulse-rifle trained right on her. 
BROKEN TUSK Chew...on...this...! 
BLAM!  A round open a nice, neat hole in the QUEEN's head.  She YOWLS. BLAM! A second round does the job.  The QUEEN relinquishes her grip and falls, SCREECHING all the way down into the raging inferno below. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER 
The last segment of the destruct mechanism's display disappears.  We hear a 
HIGH-PITCHED TONE. 
INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN 
HIROKO throws the joystick forward. 
EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN

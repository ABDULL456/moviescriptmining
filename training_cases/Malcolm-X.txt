Fourth draft (1991) Screenplay by James Baldwin, Arnold Perl and Spike Lee Based on The Autobiography of Malcolm X as told to Alex Haley 
FADE IN: 
1  	EXT. ROXBURY STREET - THE WAR YEARS - DAY 
It is a bright sunny day on a crowded street on the black side of Boston. PEOPLE and KIDS are busy with their own things. 
SHORTY bops his way down the street. He is a runty, very dark young man of 21 with a mission and a smile on his face. He wears the flamboyant style of the time: the whole zoot-suit, pegged legs and a wide brim hat with a white feather stuck in the hat band.

5 	EXT. STREET - DAY 
FOLLOW SHOT. Shorty dodges through the crowd with his packages. His smile is one of anticipation. He nods to a PAL without stopping; eyes a COUPLE OF CHICKS dancing on the street, but is not dissuaded. 
6	INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY 
Shorty has his jacket and hat off, his sleeves rolled up. He is like a surgeon preparing for an operation. His equipment is spread out on a table: can of lye, large mason jar, wooden stirring spoon, knife, the eggs. His actions have the character of a ritual: each thing being done just so, in time-honored fashion. 
He slices the potatoes and drops the thin slices into the mason jar. He adds water and makes a paste of the starch. 
Behind Shorty is a spirited barbershop conversation. ONE MAN is getting a haircut; TWO OTHERS are watching (TOOMER, JASON) one of them from behind a newspaper. A middle-aged barber, CHOLLY, is doing most of the talking. 
CHOLLY After I hit the number that woman wasn't no good to me at all. 
The men laugh. 
ANGLE - Shorty pries open the can of lye, whiffs it. It's good and strong. He pours some in the mason jar, stirring with the wooden spoon. He cracks the eggs into the mixture and stirs. He waits as fumes rise and feels the outside of the jar as it gets hot. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - The barbershop SEEN from a door, slightly ajar. A woolly head, entirely in shadow, peers out. 
CHOLLY'S VOICE She says I'm cheap cuz I won't cop her a diamond ring. Had the indignation to call me a cheap black sunovabitch to boot. 
TOOMER And when a black woman call you a cheap black sunovabitch you've been called a cheap black sunovabitch. 
Cholly is annoyed. It's _his_ story. 
CHOLLY Will you let me tell it? 
ON SHORTY - He opens the bulky package he has been carrying, unfolds a large rubber apron and gets into it. Now he dons a pair of rubber gloves. 
SHORTY Where's Homeboy? 
He is all ready; one of his hands is filled with a huge glob of Vaseline. His manner is indignant as if he were asking the whereabouts of an exasperating child. 
CHOLLY Red's in the head, man. 
TOOMER You mean hiding in the head. 
CHOLLY Hey, Red. Your man's here and waiting on you. 
His hands full, Cholly opens the door with his feet and MALCOLM comes out, a big, gawky, bright-faced country boy, wearing downhome clothes and an expression of apprehension. 
TOOMER Gonna get that first conk laid on, hunh, Homeboy? 
CHOLLY Man, don't scare him more than he's scared already. Ain't too bad... 
Malcolm allows himself to be led to an empty chair, where Cholly drapes him with a double sheet, tucking it tightly around his neck and adding a protective collar of paper. 
CHOLLY ...Like anything else. First time a chick gets her cherry popped, she might put up a little fight. But pretty soon you can't give her enough. Right, Homeboy? 
CLOSE - MALCOLM 
Malcolm gulps, his eyes on the fuming mason jar. 
Shorty starts massaging a great quantity of Vaseline into Malcolm's scalp, covering his neck and ears as well. All the men have gathered around, involved in the ritual. For Malcolm it is closer to being a kind of execution. 
CHOLLY Git his forehead and eyebrows. 
SHORTY I know what I'm doing. 
Shorty applies the Vaseline to that area.  Now he brings over the steaming jar and places it nearby. 
SHORTY (contd) Listen. You pull my coat if it's still stinging when I get through 'cause this shit can burn a hole through cement. 
CHOLLY Hold tight, baby, and keep your eyes shut. 
Malcolm nods his head, clenches his eyes and grits his teeth. Shorty applies the congolene with a comb, working it into Malcolm's hair. 
CLOSE - MALCOLM 
MALCOLM I thought you said it was gonna sting... this ain't nothin'. 
For a moment nothing happens, then the heat hits him. He yells, tries to catch his breath: his head is on fire. 
MALCOLM (contd) You motherfucker.  You're killing me. I'm burning up. My damn head is on fire. 
He nearly leaps out of the chair, but the barber restrains him. 
Shorty, utterly unmoved by the outburst, continues working the congolene into his hair. 
Malcolm breaks out of the chair wildly. But the three men drag him to a basin where Shorty has attached the shower spray. His cries filling the room, Malcolm is ducked under the spray. Shorty starts rinsing out his hair. 
SHORTY Don't fight me, man. Let me git it out. 
Malcolm is a little relieved, he tentatively opens his eyes, then he feels the congolene again and there is another outburst. Shorty forces his head under the spray, spurts the water all over his head, wetting Malcolm and the shop in the process.

9  	INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY 
SHORTY Well, Homeboy, you almost there. Turn around. 
Shorty is supervising as Malcolm tries on a zoot suit. He slips into the jacket... 
Shoes-off, Malcolm steps into the tight-fltting peg-legged pants ...... dons a wide-brimmed hat with a bright blue feather.... Finally, fully outfitted, he leans forward toward his new image in the full-length mirror, twirling a long, dangling key chain. 
Getting ready to enter the fray, the GIRL takes off her shoes and bounces out on the floor barefoot with her partner. Their advent is greeted with cheers and ad libs. Clearly the crowd has its favorites. 
WIDER SHOT 
The music gets faster and the dancing takes on a more frantic and more remarkable quality. 
FOLLOW SHOT - MALCOLM 
He is looking for his partner, the girl he brought and now he sees her. He makes his way through the watching audience. 
CLOSE - LAURA 
She is a fine chick, cool and beautiful. She smiles as she sees Malcolm approaching. 
TWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm stand together, delighted to be with one another, starting to move to the music, as they watch the dancers. 
MALCOLM Come on, baby, let's show 'em how. 
Laura smiles shyly; she's willing. 
MALCOLM (contd) You better get out of them shoes, girl. 
Laura laughs, goes quickly to a bench and changes into a pair of sneakers. 
17 	INT. THE DANCE FLOOR 
Because of the competition, Laura and Malcolm begin at high speed. In a moment they are executing the most intricate steps of the "flapping eagle" and the "kangaroo." Malcolm starts boosting her over and around his hips, then boosting her over his shoulders. Laura is the perfect partner. She loves it. 
ANGLE WITH THE CROWD 
So does the crowd, who loves new stars. There are ad lib remarks: "Go, man, go." "Hey, Red." "Mmmmmm ummm." 
ANGLE: - SHORTY 
A big, fat, hefty BLACK WOMAN takes Shorty out to the dance floor, and she takes the lead. As they do the Lindy she is slinging Shorty around like a rag doll. This woman slides him through her legs and Shorty has had enough, he runs off the dance floor, and hides. 
TWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm are, in the phrase, cooking on all burners now; and when they execute an especially intricate step, even Hamp waves over. 
Malcolm is sweating and flushed and enormously elated. He sees that people are watching him, goading him on. He notices that Sophia, in particular, has not taken her eyes off him; she is clapping in time to his steps. 
Seeing new stars in the making, the other dancers move to the side of the floor, marking time, yielding the dance floor to them. Laura and Malcolm go into a solo. 
ANGLES 
The crowd loves it. Malcolm and Sophia are very aware of each other. The finale is the classic drag, with Laura hanging limp around Malcolm's neck as he capers off the dance floor to the spontaneous applause of the audience. 
CLOSE SHOT - SOPHIA (SLO-MO) 
Clapping enthusiastically -- in open admiration. 
CLOSE SHOT - SHORTY 
Waiting to catch them as they come off. Shorty is whistling and shaking his hand appreciatively. He is also looking out for his dance partner. 
SHORTY Hey, man, gimme some skin. 
MALCOLM Shorty, this is Laura. 
Laura is flushed and out of breath and joyous. 
LAURA 'Lo. I've got to freshen up. 
MALCOLM Now you come back. 
Laura laughs as she goes. She surely will be back. 
SHORTY That's a fine chick. 
MALCOLM Fine as May wine. 
SHORTY Except she live on the hill and got a grandma. 
MALCOLM Make it too easy and it ain't no fun. 
Then his vision catches Sophia, who is approaching him. She makes a simple, direct gesture, "Want to dance?" Malcolm eyes Shorty and wordlessly glides into Sophia's arms. 
ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR 
Immediately from the glances of the other men at the dance, he is the cynosure of all eyes. He has new status. It's a heady feeling because she is the first white girl he has ever been with socially who is not an obvious whore. He begins to show off a little, cuts a few fine steps. 
TWO-SHOT. They are dancing closer than before. Sophia begins to rock his black world. 
CLOSE - MALCOLM 
Trying to play it cool -- but he is beginning to pant. Not from the dancing, but from the situation: a gorgeous white chick asking for it. 
SOPHIA Why don't you take your little girl home, Red, and come on back? 
He stops in his tracks. He can't believe it. 
SOPHIA (contd) Just walk. Don't run. It'll be here when you get back. 
He can only grin. 
18	EXT. LAURA'S HOUSE - ROXBURY - NIGHT 
The porch of a respectable house. Malcolm with Laura; he anxious to get away. 
MALCOLM I better not come in. 
LAURA I ain't stupid. 
MALCOLM I mean it's late, baby. 
LAURA I know where you're going. 
MALCOLM I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest. 
Laura walks to the door. 
MALCOLM (contd) Baby, I'll call you tomorrow. 
LAURA What for? I ain't white and I don't put out. 
The front door opens, it's Laura's grandmother, MRS. JOHNSON. 
CLOSE EARL LITTLE 
Earl Little's face is in the same exact position as Malcolm's from the previous scene. His mouth opens in terror as the moving trolley comes closer and closer to the black man lying on the tracks. 
27 	INT. A HEARING ROOM - DAY 
A room, clinically empty; table, chair, and MR. HOLWAY. He is putting papers into his briefcase; the hearing is concluded. 
LOUISE What you mean took his own life?! 
HOLWAY I'm sorry, ma'am. You heard the verdict. A man bash in the back of his head with a hammer, lay down on the tracks and kill himself! We merely act on the verdict. We don't make them. 
He is nearly out the door. 
LOUISE Do you pay or don't you? 
HOLWAY Read the policy, ma'am. It clearly states. 
28	OMIT 
29 	INT. SOPHIA'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
Malcolm lies in bed, naked under the sheet. A half-empty whiskey bottle and an ashtray full of butts are on the night table: last night's partying. 
SOPHIA You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie? 
MALCOLM C'mere. 
WIDEN TO SHOW SOPHIA at the stove fixing eggs. She wears an apron and nothing else. It's a nicely furnished middle-class apartment. 
SOPHIA Sweetie, they're almost ready. 
MALCOLM You hear me, girl? 
She shrugs, shuts off the burner, smiles and ambles toward him. 
SOPHIA You the man. 
MALCOLM You better believe it. 
She starts to sit down on the bed next to him. 
MALCOLM (contd) Sit over there. 
He points to a nearby chair. Sophia makes an amiable hand-shrug and complacently goes. 
SOPHIA You evil this morning. 
MALCOLM What's your story, baby? 
He doesn't want to hear her; he wants to talk. He goes right on: 
MALCOLM (contd) You one of them white bitches can't get enough black dick. Is that what you are? 
Sophia smiles. She aims to please. Malcolm smacks the bed next to him. She gets up and comes over. 
MALCOLM (contd) Take it off. 
She takes off the apron. 
MALCOLM (contd) Now kiss my feet. Kiss 'em! 
CLOSE - SOPHIA 
As Sophia bends to do so. 
MALCOLM Feed me. 
ANGLE. Sophia now has the scrambled eggs on a plate at Malcolm's side. She spoons some into his mouth. He chews and swallows slowly, then grabs her head and brings it to his. A long, brutal kiss. Then he pulls her head away by the hair. She looks at him: anything he wants. 
MALCOLM Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister? 
SOPHIA Me? 
MALCOLM You will, baby -- if the time come. 
SOPHIA Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot. 
Malcolm lays back on the pillow and she holds out the eggs to him. 
MALCOLM Sure wish your mama and papa could see you now. And that ofay you gonna marry. 
30	EXT. A BEACH - BRIGHT SUNLIGHT - DAY 
Malcolm and Laura are on a deserted Cape beach. They are dressed but have their shoes and socks off, and he has his trousers rolled up. They walk, like birds, avoiding getting their feet wet as the waves roll in. 
LAURA Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart. 
MALCOLM All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin. 
LAURA I do know I love you. 
Laura stops him and moves to him. Her kiss is a tender one, exploratory. Then Malcolm responds, embracing her fully. Her arms go around him as they both drop into the sand. 
CLOSE - MALCOLM AND LAURA 
LAURA Oh, Malcolm, I love you. Please, there's no one around. Now? 
Malcolm turns his head from her, he gets up. 
MALCOLM Let's go. 
LAURA Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her. 
MALCOLM Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think. 
She looks at him. 
LAURA She raised me, my mother died when I was six. Is your mother alive? 
MALCOLM Yeah, she's alive.

It reads "KALAMAZOO STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE MENTALLY INSANE" 
39 	INT. A ROOM IN THE HOSPITAL - DAY 
The room is totally white and Louise sits in a white smock at a window in a rocking chair. 
CLOSE LOUISE 
As she rocks. 
LOUISE I said it just as plain, I said, don't let them feed that boy no pig, because he got enough of the devil in him already. I told her she ain't got no reason talk to me that way cuz' my hair blow in the wind. You want my skin. All right, I'll give it to you. I'll scrape it off. See how you like it. 
ANGLE - Louise starts to sing a Negro spiritual. 
CLOSE - MALCOLM 
He has been standing there in deep pain all along. 
THE SOUND OF A SPEEDING TRAIN IS HEARD. 
40 	EXT. THE YANKEE CLIPPER - DAY 
The crack train of the New York, New Haven & Hartford speeds through the New England countryside. 
41	INT. GALLEY OF TRAIN - NIGHT 
THREE ELDERLY BLACK WAITERS and Malcolm wearing a sandwichman's uniform are crowded around a portable radio in the galley where food is prepared. The four stand around TULLY, a bland-faced personification of fine Pullman service. They are all listening to the JOE LOUIS-BILLY CONN heavyweight championship fight. 
TULLY Nigger, shut up so we can hear. 
MALCOLM C'mon, Joe. 
WAITER #1 Turn it up, Tully. 
TULLY It is up. Fool be quiet. 
WAITER #2 Tully, move the antenna. . . . 
Tully turns some knobs. 
WAITER #3 This Mick is tough. 
TULLY Joe is just playing possum. He's waiting for an opening. 
The waiters are acting as if they are at ringside. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER A left jab to the jaw and a right cross, scored by Louis and Conn is hurt, as Louis rips a right to the jaw. Conn is staggering, but he won't go down. Conn bops a left hook, he's reeling around the ring. Louis hooks a left and a right to the jaw and Conn is down. 
The waiters are going crazy. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER He's taking the count, four, five, six, seven, he's on his back, eight, nine, he's getting up, no! The referee says it's over. The bout has stopped. 
The waiters are all jumping up and down when the galley door opens. MR. COOPER, the white man in charge of the kitchen, pops his head in. 
COOPER What in hell's going on? 
In a moment's notice Tully and the others have resumed their customary servient roles. 
TULLY Nothing, Mr. Cooper. 
COOPER Got a lot of hungry customers out there. 
TULLY Yes sir, Mr. Cooper, soup done finished. 
MALCOLM On my way, Mr. Charlie. 
Cooper eyes him narrowly. 
COOPER The name is Mr. Cooper and don't you forget it. Mr. Cooper. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER The winner and still champion, Joe Louis, but what a fight Billy Conn gave.

As Malcolm hefts his sandwich basket and a large container of coffee down the aisle, hawking as he goes. 
MALCOLM Get your good haaaam and cheeeeese sandwiches. I got coffee, I got cake and I got ice cream too. Right chere. 
ANGLE FAVORING A WHITE CUSTOMER, BLADES. 
BLADES Hey, boy. Gimme a cheese on white and coffee. 
Malcolm's mood is exuberant: the fight is still in his ears. He makes the delivery with a flourish and a smile. 
MALCOLM Yes, sir. Best in the house. 
BLADES You mighty pleased with yourself, boy. 
MALCOLM Yes, sir. I aims to please. 
BLADES I like you, boy. 
45A	INSERT - FANTASY PROJECTION. Malcolm picks up a slab of cream pie and pushes it in Blades' face. 
45B	BACK TO THE PASSENGER CAR 
Normality again: Malcolm finishes serving him with complete servility. He pulls out a bill. 
BLADES Keep the change. 
And takes a satisfying bite out of his thin sandwich.

His eyes gesture. Malcolm looks: 
MALCOLM'S P0V 
Sammy at the nearby bar: his hand in his coat pocket. 
CLOSE - ARCHIE 
His hand is also in his pocket. 
MALCOLM And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down. 
ARCHIE That's what it is. Walk on out. 
MALCOLM Let Billie finish. 
ARCHIE Now. 
Archie backs away from the table, his gun on Malcolm. 
ANGLE. As Sammy moves a step toward Malcolm, Malcolm rises in his seat. 
SOPHIA You had the number. 
MALCOLM Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.

ARCHIE What you say? 
SAMMY He gave it to you, Archie. He did. 
91  	EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT 
Malcolm comes running out of an alleyway and onto the street. He stops to catch his breath, to regain his composure. He is shook up, frustrated, but mostly saddened. He then runs down the block and into a CLOSEUP. 
91A 	INT. LITTLE HOUSE - LANSING MICHIGAN - NIGHT (REMEMBERED TIME) - FINAL FLASHBACK 
CLOSE - EARL 
Earl is sitting up in bed, he wakes his sleeping wife Louise, next to her is a baby in a crib, another child. Malcolm sleeps between Earl and her. 
91AA	ANGLE - HOUSE 
Outside the house are 5 members of THE BLACK LEGION. They are dressed in the style of the KKK, but in black sheets rather than white. WE SEE gasoline cans being passed around. 
EARL Somebody out there. Wake the children. 
Earl starts to put on his overalls and reaches for his gun which sits on a nearby chair when an explosion of flames greets the house. 
EARL (contd) Everybody out. OUT! OUT! Get the kids. 
ANGLE - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM 
Music of a dance combo heard in BG.

94	INT. HARVARD SQUARE APARTMENT - DAY 
Shorty, Sophia and PEG face Malcolm -- stoned in a chair. PEG is 17, Sophia's kid sister and Shorty's date. 
SHORTY You got to eat somethin', Red. 
SOPHIA You want eggs, baby? 
MALCOLM Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby? 
SHORTY I ain't doing bad. 
MALCOLM Man, the name musicians ain't got shit. How you gonna have something? I need a stake, a bundle, a grand. My woman can't afford it; my homey ain't got it. How about you baby? What you got? 
Peg smiles, afraid of Malcolm. 
SHORTY Jesus, Red, she's just a kid. 
MALCOLM Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this. 
Shorty eyes him with amazement. The degree of Malcolm's depravity surprises even him. 
MALCOLM Surprise you, baby? Well, that's the way it is. What kind of scratch you got on you? Turn out. Let me have it. All of you-- 
Glances exchanged among Shorty, Sophia and Peg. Shorty reaches into his pocket. 
95 	INT. HARVARD SQUARE APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Malcolm with Sophia, Shorty and Peg around him. 
MALCOLM We gone rob this town blind. Anybody want out say so. 
Nobody answers; they'll go with Malcolm. 
MALCOLM (contd) Okay. I got the stake and I got a fence. I need a driver. 
PEG How about Rudy? 
MALCOLM Who's Rudy? 
SHORTY Yeah, Rudy. 
JUMP CUT: 
95A 	SAME LOCATION - LATER 
RUDY is with them. He is a good-looking, very-light skinned black, tough as they come. 
RUDY I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one. 
MALCOLM What can you do? 
They are in the process of appraising each other, seeing which one has the bigger penis. 
RUDY You name it, feller. 
SHORTY Rudy does catering. Rich joints on Beacon Hill. 
MALCOLM That ain't bad. 
SHORTY Tell him about Baldy. 
RUDY Yeah. This rich ofay, like he's 60. I give him a bath on Friday. 
Peg and Sophia are listening, a little horrified. 
RUDY (contd) Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off. 
MALCOLM So what about him? 
RUDY So? The man got silver, china, rugs-- 
MALCOLM Might be all right. 
RUDY Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge? 
Malcolm smiles easily. 
MALCOLM You want to be the head man? 
RUDY That's right. 
MALCOLM Head nigger in charge? 
RUDY I'm the man. 
MALCOLM Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this. 
He takes out his gun, a .38 revolver. He dumps the shells on the table, then reinserts one shell and twirls the barrel. 
MALCOLM (contd) I'll flip first. 
He puts the revolver to his own head. 
PEG Don't. 
Malcolm squeezes the trigger. It clicks. Now he twirls the barrel again and hands the gun to Rudy. 
MALCOLM Your flip, baby. 
Rudy is staring at him; so are they all. Malcolm puts the gun to his temple again. 
SOPHIA Red, for God's sake-- 
He pulls the trigger a second time. Click. Now he twirls it again. 
SHORTY Christ, Red, no-- 
PEG I can't stand it. 
Each time a gate is locked his tension increases. His face is a mask hiding his fury, violence and the hunger of an advanced junkie who has not had a fix in over a week. 
GUARD WILKINS Crichlow. 
SECOND PRISONER A 5991301. 
Same procedure. 
ANGLE. SHOOTING PAST MALCOLM, FAVORING TWO OTHER PRISONERS. The guards are approaching Malcolm's cell. Past Malcolm are two experienced PRISONERS who have been watching Malcolm during the scene. They whisper surreptitiously without moving their bodies, and barely moving their lips. One of the prisoners is PETE, a huge barrel of a man, a lifer -- beaten by the system and a lifetime of incarceration. The other is BEMBRY, a man of no great physicality, but who possesses immediately the gift of leadership. It is clear that Pete and others look up to him with great respect. 
PETE Looka Satan. 
BEMBRY I see him. 
Bembry's language is very unhip. He speaks carefully. He respects words and he respects himself, something which sets him apart from all the other prisoners. 
PETE He bout to bust. 
BEMBRY No, he's not gonna bust. But he's not gonna fix his face to please them, neither. 
ANGLE. The check-in has reached the man next to Malcolm. 
GUARD WILKINS Harrington. 
THIRD PRISONER B 775717. 
GUARD BARNES Yeah. Lucky Seven. 
Door slammed and locked. 
CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM 
The guards are now in front of him. 
GUARD WILKINS Little. 
Malcolm doesn't move. 
GUARD BARNES State your number. 
Malcolm doesn't answer, doesn't blink. 
GUARD WILKINS Little. 
ANGLE. Bembry in the FG of the scene. 
BEMBRY He's a new fish, Mr. Barnes. Give him a break. 
It's a bold step by Bembry and the prisoners look over at him with admiration. Barnes accepts the irregularity and calls over to Bembry. 
GUARD BARNES 0kay, I'll give him a break. Now state your number, Little. 
CLOSE - MALCOLM 
MALCOLM I forgot it. 
CLOSE SHOT - BEMBRY 
Shaking his head in anguish. He knows what's coming. 
ANGLE. Barnes makes a small gesture and Wilkins seizes Malcolm, grabbing his head and uniform at the same time. Stenciled on the chest of his faded dungarees is Malcolm's number. The guard bends Malcolm's head to the number, shoving the material in Malcolm's face. 
GUARD WILKINS Can you read, boy? Thass your number. 
GUARD BARNES Now say it. 
MALCOLM I'm Malcolm Little, not no goddam number. 
GUARD WILKINS Oh, yes you is, baby; thass all you is. 
And slams Malcolm hard. He slumps to the floor. 
GUARD BARNES Two days in the hole. Take him. 
Wilkins drags Malcolm off as Barnes resumes the roll call. 
GUARD BARNES (contd) Burnham. 
FOURTH PRISONER A 551613, sir. 
JUMP CUT: 
103 	INT. A SOLITARY CELL - DAY 
Only the faintest light comes into the hideous room, which consists of a mattress and a slop bucket. If Malcolm were to stretch out his arms, he could touch both walls. He lies half on the stone floor, half on the mattress. 
A clang as the heavy door is opened. 
GUARD CONE Time's up. Get on your feet. 
Malcolm stands. 
GUARD CONE (contd) Little, state your number. 
A beat as Malcolm stares at the man, refusing to answer. 
GUARD CONE (contd) You just drew two more days. 
And slams the door shut. 
104	INT. SOLITARY - NIGHT 
It is almost pitch black. We can almost smell the stench of the room. Malcolm sits stony-faced, his back against a wall. 
TRUSTEE'S VOICE Water. 
The long spigot of a watering can is pushed through an opening in the cell door. Malcolm, animal-like, leaps at it and bends the spout, wrenching it off in his fury. 
105	OMIT 
106	INT. SOLITARY CELL - DAY 
TWO-SHOT - A WHITE CHAPLAIN AND MALCOLM 
CHAPLAIN GILL Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son? 
MALCOLM How bout that? 
BEMBRY Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years. 
MALCOLM A black man playing big league ball is something. 
BEMBRY I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue-eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history. 
SHOTS OF THE FACES OF THE BLACK BALL PLAYERS AND THE CONVICTS 
In the stands, cheering and joyous. 
BEMBRY (contd) Do they know who they are? Do you know where you came from? We are the Original People. 
Malcolm is listening to him now. 
BEMBRY (contd) What's your name, boy? 
Malcolm is startled; answers like a boy. 
MALCOLM Little. 
BEMBRY No. That's the name of the slave-master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you? 
CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM 
Wrapped in thought. 
ANGLE ON MALCOLM 
MALCOLM I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan. 
BEMBRY Who are you? 
CLOSE - MALCOLM 
Malcolm cannot answer because he truly does not know. 
A ball is hit. Malcolm watches its flight but his face is fixed somewhere between understanding and anger: it is the face of the future leader. 
BEMBRY I told you we are a nation, the lost Tribe of Shabazz in the wilderness of North America. 
117 	INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE PRISON - LATE AFTERNOON 
The rays of the sun come through bars that cut across Malcolm and Bembry's face. 
BEMBRY Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm-- 
MALCOLM Then the devil is white. 
BEMBRY I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils. 
MALCOLM I sure met some. 
BEMBRY No. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white man is a devil." He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men. 
CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM 
Listening. 
BEMBRY Have you ever known a good white man in all your life? Think back, did you ever meet one who wasn't evil? 
A prison whistle is heard. 
119	OMIT 
120	INT. A NICHE IN A PRISON WALL - P.M. 
Malcolm and Bembry standing close together. The feeling is of someone taking communion: with Bembry the minister and Malcolm the communicant. Their voices are little more than whispers. 
BEMBRY The body is a holy repository. 
MALCOLM I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women. 
BEMBRY A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light. 
Malcolm lifts his head. 
MALCOLM I will do it. 
BEMBRY But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission. 
Bembry kneels in a praying position. Malcolm stands. 
MALCOLM I can't. 
BEMBRY For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth-- 
MALCOLM I want to, Bembry, but I can't. 
BEMBRY --the hardest and the greatest. 
MALCOLM I can't. 
BEMBRY For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth-- 
MALCOLM I want to, Bembry, but I can't. 
BEMBRY --the hardest and the greatest. 
MALCOLM I don't know what to say to Allah. 
BEMBRY Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm? 
Malcolm laugh-snorts: 
MALCOLM Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house. 
BEMBRY Tell Him that. 
MALCOLM I don't know how. 
BEMBRY You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it. 
MALCOLM I want to. God knows I want to. 
MALCOLM They were Hebrew, weren't they? 
CHAPLAIN GILL That's right. 
MALCOLM As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew. 
CHAPLAIN GILL Just what is your question? 
MALCOLM What color were the original Hebrews? 
CHAPLAIN GILL I told you we don't know for certain. 
MALCOLM Then we don't know that God was white. 
There is a strong reaction to this. 
CHAPLAIN GILL Now just a moment, just a moment-- 
MALCOLM But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black. 
CHAPLAIN GILL Just what are you saying? 
MALCOLM I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black. 
127A	INSERT FLASH - A BLOND, BLUE-EYED JESUS ON THE CROSS (Note: Try to get footage from _The Last Temptation of Christ_ [Willem Dafoe]) 
MALCOLM'S VOICE God is black. 
128	INT. ELIJAH'S OFFICE - DAY 
Malcolm opens the door, the room is dark and he sees a small, slight man standing against the window, he doesn't move. This is the same man who appeared in Malcolm's cell, this is the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm slowly moves toward him; he is completely humbled in his presence. 
CLOSE - ELIJAH 
He turns from the window to Malcolm. 
ELIJAH My son, you've been a thief, drug dealer and a pimp and the world is still full of temptation. When God bragged how faithful Job was, the devil argued that only God's protective hedge around him kept him pure, the devil said remove the hedge and he will curse his maker. Malcolm, your hedge has been removed and I believe you will remain faithful. 
CLOSE - MALCOLM 
He cannot say anything and he drops his head, he is overwhelmed with heartfelt emotion. 
129	INT. BEMBRY'S LIVING ROOM - P.M. 
In contrast to the peaceful family scene, the room is a beehive of activity. Sidney is turning out leaflets on a mimeograph machine; Lorraine is busy making up a mailing list using 3 x 5 file cards; Bembry is recruiting on the telephone. 
MALCOLM How many you turning out? 
SIDNEY 
MALCOLM Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do. 
SIDNEY Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation. 
Earl moves toward Malcolm and extends his hands. Malcolm shakes it warmly. 
MALCOLM We can always use another good brother. 
EARL I'm a willing servant for Allah. 
129A 	EXT. CHURCH - DAY 
Sunday service has let out and Malcolm, Earl, and Sidney are "fishing." They're trying to convert the Black Christians. Malcolm speaks, while the others hand out leaflets. 
MALCOLM You think you are Christians, and yet you see your so-called white Christian brother hanging black Christians on trees. You say that white man loves you and yet he has done every evil act against you. He has everything while he is living and tells you to be a good slave and when you die you will have more than he has in Beulah's land. We so-called Negroes are in pitiful shape. Get off your knees praying to a picture of a white, pale blond, and blue-eyed Jesus. Come out of the sky. Build heaven on earth. Islam is the black man's true religion. 
130	EXT. STREET CORNER, 125TH AND SEVENTH AVENUE - DAY 
Malcolm is talking to a CROWD from a ladder. 
MALCOLM And that the white man is the devil. Yes, God is black and you are made in His image and don't know it. That's how brainwashed you are. 
The crowd is listening, caught up in Malcolm's intensity. 
MALCOLM (contd) My brothers and sisters, they tell you you will sprout wings when you die and fly to heaven. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad tells you that's pie in the sky. 
ANGLE ON SIDNEY 
Amid the listeners, watching their response. 
MALCOLM'S VOICE Have you ever seen a black man who wasn't down on his knees begging the Lord to give him in heaven what the white devil enjoys right here on earth? 
CLOSE SHOT - SEVERAL LISTENERS 
They turn from Malcolm, moving a few steps away, and now are the audience on an adjacent SPEAKER. He is a young firebrand: 
SPEAKER The Harlem Council fights for rat control, for rent control and for community control of our schools. 
PAN CONTINUES to take in ANOTHER SPEAKER, a few feet away. WE SEE the street corner is Harlem's Hyde Park, with half a dozen SPEAKERS haranguing the crowd with half a dozen panaceas. That Malcolm is just one among many: 
SECOND SPEAKER If the man behind the counter ain't black, don't go in. Boycott the man. Be black. Think black. Buy black. 
ANGLE - MALCOLM 
MALCOLM Come to our Temple and hear the truth. Because, brother and sister, you are dead. Yes you are, mentally dead, spiritually dead, morally dead. And we are here to resurrect the black man back from the dead. 
131	EXT. OPEN AIR "MAID'S MARKET" - DAY 
A place where black women come to offer themselves for day work. SEVERAL ARE SEEN. A WHITE WOMEN comes up to one to interview her (bargain with her). Malcolm's voice is heard before he is seen, speaking to the women from a ladder. 
MALCOLM'S VOICE My beautiful sister, for you are beautiful. Beautiful because you are black. Because black is beautiful. You work in the white folks' kitchen so I don't have to tell you that they're devils. 
CLOSE - MALCOLM 
MALCOLM (contd) And you are putting yourselves on the auction block, letting them examine you like a horse, like a slave. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches that you are black and should be proud... 
FACE OF ONE BLACK WOMAN, beginning to shake her head in accord. 
132	INT. TEMPLE #7 - NIGHT 
The SAME WOMAN, now at a Muslim meeting. The faces of other listeners (from the church and from the maids' market) are scattered in Malcolm's audience. 
The headquarters itself shows the progress Malcolm has made. It is better furnished, larger, and the chairs are filled. Bembry, Sidney, and Lorraine are in the back of the room, pleased with the growth. Malcolm stands at a podium. 
MALCOLM We're not American, we're Africans who happen to be in America. We were kidnapped and brought here against our will from Africa. We didn't land on Plymouth Rock, brothers and sister. Plymouth Rock landed on us. 
136 	INT. TEMPLE #7 - NIGHT 
Malcolm is addressing a HUGE AUDIENCE. His tone is more intense, more personal than before, because of his recent encounters. In the audience, sitting with Bembry, is BETTY, a lovely dark-skinned woman. Her interest in Malcolm (true, also, for most of the other unmarried sisters) is more than religious. 
MALCOLM --and what has the white devil made of them: dead souls. Oh, my he has no conscience. He should fall on his knees and say, "My kind commits history's greatest crime against your kind every day of your life." But does he? No. He scorns you, splits your head with his nightstick and calls you nigger. If you've had it, then stand up and come forward. If not us, then who? If not now, then when? 
ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE 
Many stand, some walk toward the podium speaking his name: "I'm with you, Brother Malcolm," "Praise Allah," "Me, Brother Malcolm." 
There is applause; some of the audience get to their feet -- Malcolm acknowledges their approval, trying to quiet them, but caught up in the heady excitement of leadership. 
CLOSE - BETTY AND BEMBRY 
Both are moved by Malcolm's performances. 
BETTY (whispering) He ought to try to make it a little easier, Brother Bembry. 
BEMBRY Why don't you try telling him that, Sister Betty? 
137	INT. A LARGE ANTEROOM IN TEMPLE #7 - NIGHT 
The Muslim movement has grown enormously. The activity in this anteroom, leading to other rooms off it, shows that. Betty and Bembry stand before a Directory announcing activities in the Temple: MONDAY - Fruit of Islam Meeting; TUESDAY - Unity Night; WEDNESDAY - Student Enrollment; THURSDAY - Muslim Girls Training; FRIDAY - General Civilization Class; SATURDAY - Swahili, etc. 
A stir of people and activity as Malcolm enters the anteroom. He excuses himself from a group of MUSLIMS, making his way toward Bembry. 
MALCOLM (little out of breath) Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street? 
BEMBRY I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty. 
Malcolm nods at her; she nods in return. 
BEMBRY (contd) The Sister lectures our Muslim women in hygiene and diet. 
Malcolm mutters "very good," but his mind is clearly on a million other details. 
BEMBRY (contd) The Sister stresses care of the body and regular eating habits. 
Malcolm is still distracted. 
BETTY The Sister wonders if the Brother knows what Harriet Tubman did between taking souls to the Promised Land? 
Malcolm is stopped. He looks at Betty. 
MALCOLM What? 
BETTY She ate. 
Malcolm laughs. 
BETTY (contd) And the Sister suggests he put his actions where his mouth is. 
Malcolm's laughter is heard, in response. 
138 	INT. MUSLIM CAFETERIA - NIGHT TWO-SHOT - BETTY AND MALCOLM 
MALCOLM Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why? 
BETTY If you want to tell me. 
CUT TO: 
138A 	EXT. ELIJAH'S GARDEN - DAY 
Malcolm sits next to the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. The student and the teacher. 
MALCOLM If you want to tell me. 
ELIJAH Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women. 
CUT BACK TO: 
138B 	BETTY AND MALCOLM 
Betty says nothing, she merely pushes the salad plate a little toward him. The food has thus far gone untouched. Malcolm continues. 
CLOSE - MALCOLM 
MALCOLM Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms. 
BETTY Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage? 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE - ELIJAH 
ELIJAH No. We are not Catholic priests. We do not practice celibacy. If a woman is the right height for a man, the right complexion, if her age is half the man's plus seven, if she understands that man's essential nature is strong and woman's weak, if she loves children, can cook, sew and stay out of trouble-- 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE - BETTY 
BETTY I think you've made your points, Brother Malcolm. 
MALCOLM What points? 
BETTY That you haven't time for either marriage or eating-- 
Malcolm chuckles a bit. 
BETTY (contd) --and that women aren't the only ones who talk a lot. 
Now he bursts out laughing. 
CLOSE - BROTHERS SIDNEY AND EARL 
They are alarmed at Brother Minister's behavior. 
TWO-SHOT - BETTY AND MALCOLM 
BETTY If you'll start eating, there is a question I have. Go ahead. Start. 
He takes a forkful of the salad. 
BETTY (contd) Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork. 
Malcolm's face goes taut. He nods sharply at Sidney, as Benjamin watches them both. 
MALCOLM'S VOICE I demand to see Brother Johnson. 
142 	INT. POLICE STATION - LATE P.M. 
Malcolm facing a DESK SERGEANT, TWO UNIFORMED COPS and a PLAINCLOTHESMAN off to one side. 
SERGEANT Who the hell are you? 
MALCOLM I'm from Muslim Temple 7. 
COP Never heard of you. 
MALCOLM Where is he? 
The police respond with a squeeze play intended to intimidate Malcolm: 
SERGEANT Nobody here by that name. 
PLAINCLOTHES What's your name, feller? 
He feels the power play and stiffens in resistance. 
MALCOLM I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out. 
PLAINCLOTHES You heard the Sergeant. Outside. 
Malcolm stands his ground coolly. 
MALCOLM Take a look out that window. I intend to see Brother Johnson. 
The cops eye each other. Plainclothes walks to the window. 
143	EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE - LATE P.M. 
Across from the station is a phalanx of some FIFTY MEN of the Fruit of Islam. All are dressed in dark suits with white shirts. They stand in military formation: eyes forward, every face burning. People from the neighborhood have formed a crowd behind and around them. WE MAKE OUT Benjamin among the crowd. 
143A	INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
PLAINCLOTHES Who the hell are they? 
MALCOLM Brothers of Brother Johnson. 
PLAINCLOTHES Eddie, let's see that blotter. 
TWO-SHOT - FAVOR MALCOLM 
As the cops examine the police blotter. 
SERGEANT Yeah. We got a Muslim. The relief must of put it down. 
PLAINCLOTHES But you can't see him. You ain't his lawyer. 
SERGEANT No lawyer, no see. 
MALCOLM Until I'm satisfied Brother Johnson is receiving proper medical attention, no one will move. 
Cops eye each other. Plainclothes nods slightly, he has to give in, Malcolm is not playing. 
144	INT. A LOCKUP - SAME 
The back of Malcolm's head, as he examines Brother Johnson. As he comes up OUT OF FRAME, WE SEE that Johnson has been badly beaten. 
MALCOLM (shaking) Only a pig could do a thing like that. 
PLAINCLOTHES Watch your tongue, boy. 
MALCOLM Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that. 
Sergeant puts a restraining hand on Plainclothes. 
MALCOLM (contd) That man belongs in a hospital. Get an ambulance. Now! 
145 	EXT. THE STREET - LATER (DARKER) 
As Johnson's body, on a stretcher, is hurried into an ambulance. The crowd has grown in proportions. There are ad libs: "Goddam pigs," "Damn police brutality," "Least they got him out of the meat house." 
Malcolm with the Sergeant and a LIEUTENANT, as the ambulance pulls away. 
LIEUTENANT All right, break it up. You got what you wanted. 
MALCOLM I'm not satisfied. 
Malcolm starts walking down the center of the street, after the ambulance. 
MALCOLM (contd) To the hospital. 
The Fruit of Islam fall in behind him, marching slowly. It takes on the start of a march as the neighborhood people fall in behind them. People (especially kids) race with them on the street and on the sidewalk. 
ANGLE - BENJAMIN 
Benjamin fights his way through the crowd trying to walk beside Malcolm, the Brothers in the Fruit stop him and Benjamin drops back. 
146 	EXT. LENOX AVENUE - NIGHT 
Now the march has taken over the broad avenue. COPS are forced to redirect traffic, holding up crosstown cars as the group walks solemnly by. The people walking behind have swelled it to a huge demonstration. Their faces reflect their anger and their satisfaction that, for once, something is being done about what has happened. 
147 	EXT. HARLEM HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
LONG SHOT SHOWS the Muslim men in perfect order, calm with their arms folded across their chests, waiting. Their eyes are on Malcolm as he walks toward the hospital entrance. 
SHOTS 
--of the growing crowd. 
--of the nervous cops, including some big brass. 
--of kids watching from a rooftop. 
--of Benjamin trying to emulate the Fruit of Islam. 
148	EXT. OUTSIDE HARLEM HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
Malcolm is standing in front of the Fruit of Islam men, as HIGHRANKING POLICE OFFICER GREEN comes over. 
MALCOLM Allah Akbar. 
The sweeping done, they stand together near a table at a window. 
ELIJAH Tonight I shall introduce you as my National Representative. It will be a difficult task. Your assignment is to build temples all over this nation. More work than you have ever done in your life and you will be in the public eye. My son, beware of those cameras, they are just as bad as a narcotic. 
ANGLE - AIDES and OTHERS come into the room now. They are listening. 
ELIJAH (contd) Yes, the white devil will watch your every step. Even your own Brothers will become jealous, and hostile, go slowly. So I offer you a parable -- regarding your work. 
Elijah picks up a glass and sets it before Malcolm. 
ELIJAH (contd) Here is a glass, dirty and its water foul. If you offer it to the people and they have no choice, they must drink out of it. But if you present them with this glass-- 
He is holding a clean glass, with clear water in it. 
ELIJAH (contd) --and let them make their decision, they will choose the pure vessel. Islam is the only religion which addresses the needs and problems of the so-called Negro, especially in the ghettos -- Islam is the only way out from drugs, crime, unemployment, prostitution, alcohol, gambling, fornication and adultery. 
Elijah holds up the clear glass. 
VOICE OF MALCOLM X This sweet, gentle man gave me the truth from his own mouth. And I adored him, in the sense of the Latin root of the word. Adorare, to worship and to fear. He was the first man I ever feared -- not fear such as the one has of a gun but the fear one has of the power of the sun, I pledged myself to him, even if it cost me my life. 
152	INT. A HOSPITAL WARD - DAY 
Betty is administering to a PATIENT, as a phone is heard ringing. It's answered. ANOTHER NURSE motions Betty to the phone. She finishes with her patient and goes quickly. 
BETTY Hello. 
MALCOLM'S VOICE Sister Betty? 
BETTY Yes. 
153	EXT. A PAY PHONE AT A GAS STATION - DAY 
MALCOLM I'm in Detroit. 
BETTY I know. 
MALCOLM At a gas station. (a beat) Will you marry me? 
BETTY Yes. 
MALCOLM Did you hear what I said? 
BETTY Yes I did. Did you hear my answer? 
MALCOLM I think so. Can you catch a plane? 
BETTY Yes. Did you eat? 
MALCOLM I love you. 
154 	INT. BEMBRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Betty and Malcolm sit on the floor in the dimlit room, very close. 
MALCOLM It won't be easy. 
BETTY Just hold me. 
MALCOLM It will be rough. 
BETTY Hush your mouth. 
MALCOLM I'll be away a lot. 
BETTY You're with me even when you're away. 
He embraces her. Then Betty laughs. 
BETTY (contd) I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore. 
MALCOLM What do you think? 
BETTY The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you. 
Full embrace. 
BEMBRY'S VOICE We're waiting on you folks. You trying to starve us? 
155	INT. BEMBRY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Malcolm has just cut the cake and handed a slice to Betty. Amid laughter and great warmth, Sidney unfurls the front page of the _Messenger_, the Muslim newspaper. Headline reads: "MALCOLM X WEDS BETTY SAUNDERS." Betty kisses her husband and Bembry, Lorraine, Earl, Sidney, Peter and VARIOUS BROTHERS AND SISTERS applaud. 
We notice the subtle change in the apartment: it is more comfortable; there is even evidence of some small luxury: a TV set, a new settee, etc. 
156	EXT. RALLY - HARLEM - DAY 
Malcolm is speaking to a GOOD SIZED AUDIENCE: 
MALCOLM I must emphasize at the outstart, that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad is not a politician, so I'm not here this afternoon as a Republican, nor a Democrat, not as a Mason nor an Elk, not as a Christian nor a Jew, not as a Catholic nor a Protestant, not as a Baptist nor a Methodist, not even as an American. For if I was an American the problem that confronts our people today would not exist. So I stand here as what I was when I was born: A BLACK MAN! 
CROWD REACTIONS 
MALCOLM (contd) Before there were any such things as Democrats or Republicans, we were black. Before there were any such things as Masons or Elks, we were black. Before there were any such things as Jews or Christians, we were black people. In fact long before there was ever any such place as America, we were black people... And after America has long passed from the scene there will still be BLACK PEOPLE. 
CLOSE - BENJAMIN 
He is neatly dressed in white shirt, jacket and tie, a fine young Muslim. 
BENJAMIN 2X Take your time. 
157	INT. CHICAGO TEMPLE - NIGHT 
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad sits on the stage to the right of Malcolm. This is a larger audience. 
MALCOLM What kind of black people does the Honorable Elijah Muhammad speak for? Black people who are jobless... the black masses who are poor, hungry, and angry, the black masses who are dissatisfied with the slums and ghettos in which we have been forced to live... the black masses who are tired of listening to the promises of white politicians to correct the miserable living conditions that exist in our community... the black masses that are sick of the inhuman acts of bestial brutality practiced by these semi-savage white policemen that patrol our community, like the occupation forces of a conquering enemy army... the black masses who are fed up with the anemic, Uncle Tom leadership set up by the white man to act as a spokesman for our people and to KEEP US SATISFIED AND PACIFIED WITH NOTHING! 
CROWD - REACTIONS 
CLOSE - MALCOLM 
MALCOLM If the black man cannot go back to his own people and his own land, Elijah Muhammad is asking that a part of the United States be separated and given to the Muslims so they can live separately. 
CLOSE - ELIJAH 
DR. PAYSON Let him finish. 
MALCOLM Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one. 
BROTHER BENJAMIN Tell it. 
MALCOLM --there's another one. The majority of black Americans today are Field Negroes. They don't talk about OUR progress, about OUR government, OUR navy, OUR astronauts. Hell, they won't even let you near the plant. 
159F	INT. ELIJAH'S OFFICE - DAY 
Bembry turns off the TV set and he commences to plant the seeds of "betrayal." 
CLOSE - BEMBRY 
BEMBRY Your holy apostle, dear Messenger, I am your true servant and the brothers asked me to tell you Malcolm is getting too much press. The brothers think he thinks _he_ is the Nation of Islam, that he has aspirations to lead the Nation. It was you who made Malcolm the man he is. You lifted him out of the darkness. 
CLOSE - ELIJAH 
ELIJAH Go and tell the brothers what Brother Minister is doing, has done, has been of great benefit to the Nation. 
CLOSER - BEMBRY 
BEMBRY Great benefit for himself. 
159G	BRIEF MONTAGE. THE RISE OF MALCOLM X 
EXT. STREET - HARLEM - DAY 
Malcolm is walking the streets of Harlem like he is campaigning for office. He has Brothers Sidney, Earl, and Benjamin at his side, a CROWD follows him. Malcolm sees a WINO. 
MALCOLM Brother Man, put that bottle down, take that poison away from your lips. That's what the devil wants you to do, stay high, out of your natural mind. I know, I've been there. 
The wino looks at Malcolm and continues to drink his wine. 
159H	--Malcolm emerges from a doorway to be met by an army of TV REPORTERS armed with microphones. He walks; they follow. 
159I	--Malcolm walking in Harlem, urging people to lift themselves up, come to the meetings, etc. 
159J 	INT. TEMPLE #7 
Malcolm sits with Benjamin. 
MALCOLM It's time you received your X. But first you must copy this letter, exactly as I give it to you; down to the dotted "i's," crossed "t's," everything. And you must go on a fast, just water and juices, that's it. 
CLOSE - BENJAMIN 
He takes the letter from Malcolm and looks at it. 
BENJAMIN I'll have it tomorrow. 
MALCOLM Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact. 
--Benjamin goes off in a corner and very quickly copies the letter, he's so anxious. 
--Benjamin hands Malcolm his letter, Malcolm shakes his head and hands it back, it's not exact. 
159K	EXT. STREET - HARLEM - DAY 
Malcolm is talking to a group of PEOPLE who are having a rent strike. 
MALCOLM When you live in a poor neighborhood, you're living in an area where you have poor schools. 
159L 	CUTAWAY TO MALCOLM AND BENJAMIN 
Malcolm hands him back his letter again. The fast is getting to Benjamin. 
MALCOLM (contd) When you have poor schools you have poor teachers. When you have poor teachers, you get a poor education. 
159M	CUTAWAYS TO THE DESPAIR OF HARLEM - SLUMS, TENEMENTS, GARBAGE, RATS 
MALCOLM (contd) Poor education, you only work on poor paying jobs and that enables you to live again in a poor neighborhood. 
159N	CUTAWAY TO BLACK FACES 
MALCOLM (contd) So it's a very vicious cycle. We've got to break it. 
159O	INT. MUSLIM CAFETERIA 
Benjamin weakly walks toward Malcolm and gives him his letter, which he takes. The fast is wearing him out. 
CLOSE - MALCOLM 
Malcolm is inspecting it. 
CLOSE - BENJAMIN 
His face is filled with apprehension. 
ANGLE - MALCOLM AND BENJAMIN 
MALCOLM You are now Benjamin 2X. 
BENJAMIN 2X All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister. 
MALCOLM Come, sit with us. 
ANGLE - TABLE 
Benjamin 2X sits with Malcolm and Brothers Earl and Sidney. 
MALCOLM We are now sitting with Brother Benjamin 2X. 
EARL Allah Akbar. 
SIDNEY You will be good. 
BENJAMIN 2X Brother Minister, can I have something to eat? 
Everyone laughs. 
MALCOLM Let's get this man some food. 
160	EXT. HARVARD SQUARE - DAY 
A CROWD OF STUDENTS outside the Law School. The setting is the same as the last time we saw Malcolm and Shorty here, except now the students part for him. Malcolm walks slowly toward the entrance, looking up at the Latin inscription of the building when he is stopped by a WHITE COED. 
MALCOLM I just want to sit here and be still. 
BETTY We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it. 
MALCOLM Talk about what? 
BETTY The talk is everywhere! 
MALCOLM There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation? 
BETTY We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more. 
She picks up the newspaper and reads from it: 
BETTY (contd) "Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..." 
MALCOLM There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger. 
BETTY "Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 
MALCOLM I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight. 
BETTY To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend? 
MALCOLM Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you? 
Betty gets up, goes to him gently. 
BETTY No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own. 
MALCOLM (rationalizing) I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing. 
BETTY Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!! 
MALCOLM Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life. 
BETTY A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture. 
MALCOLM Is that what this is about? Material wealth? 
BETTY What do we have, Malcolm. A broken-down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance. 
MALCOLM The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me. 
BETTY Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind? 
She touches him very gently. 
BETTY (contd) Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home? 
MALCOLM What do you want me to do? Our people need me. 
BETTY We need you too! 
MALCOLM What do you want me to do? 
BETTY Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. If you won't do that for yourself do it for us. 
164A	DETECTIVE MONTAGE 
Malcolm knocks on the door of Evelyn Williams, one of the two secretaries/wives. She opens the door and has child in her arms. 
ANGLE - APARTMENT 
SISTER EVELYN Her name is Eva Marie, she's 2 years old. Brother Minister, I did nothing wrong. I did nothing to be put in isolation. I believed in him. I believed in the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. 
CLOSE - MALCOLM

MALCOLM Sister Evelyn, believe in Allah.

CLOSE - MALCOLM 
MALCOLM He told you that? 
SISTER LUCILLE Yes sir. 
MALCOLM Are you sure? 
SISTER LUCILLE Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want. 
MALCOLM Allah will provide. 
165 	INT. BEMBRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM 
He has said everything on his mind and waits for Bembry's answer. 
PAN TO BEMBRY 
BEMBRY What are you talking about -- "blackout"? Some of the Brothers are a little jealous. Maybe they think you been a little -- overpublicized. That's all. Forget it. It's nothing. 
Malcolm is listening closely. Bembry puts an arm around him, man-to-man. 
BEMBRY (contd) Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other. 
MALCOLM (quoting Bembry back to himself) "I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle." 
Sidney reluctantly leaves, walks out the door, past Betty. She looks at him, then Malcolm. 
173 	INT. HOTEL THERESA - DAY 
Malcolm -- backed by Brothers Earl and Benjamin 2X -- faces a roomful of SUPPORTERS and REPORTERS. 
MALCOLM Because 1964 threatens to be a very explosive year on the racial front, and because I myself intend to be very active in every phase of the American Negro struggle for HUMAN RIGHTS, I have called this press conference, this morning in order to clarify my own position in the struggle -- especially in regards to politics and nonviolence. In the past I thought the thoughts, spoke the words of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, that day is over. From now on I speak my own words, and think my own thoughts. Internal differences within the Nation of Islam forced me out of it. I did not leave of my own free will. But now that it has happened, I intend to make the most of it. Now that I have more independence of action, I intend to use a more flexible approach toward working with others to get a solution to this problem. I do not pretend to be a divine man, but I do believe in divine guidance, divine power, and in the fulfillment of divine prophecy. I am not educated, nor am I an expert in any particular field, but I am sincere, and my sincerity is my credentials. I'm not out to fight other Negro leaders or organizations. We must find a common solution, to a common problem. I am going to organize and head a new mosque in New York City, known as the Muslim Mosque, Inc. This gives us a religious base, and the spiritual force necessary to rid our people of the vices that destroy the moral fiber of our community. Our political philosophy will be black nationalism. Our economic and social philosophy will be black nationalism. The Muslim Mosque, Inc. will remain wide open for ideas and financial aid from all quarters. Whites can help us, but they can't join us. There can be no black-white unity until there is first some black unity. 
A host of questions fired all at once: How many of Elijah's followers will join you? etc, etc, etc. 
Malcolm calms them: 
MALCOLM (contd) There is one further preparation I need. It is a return to the source of our great religion. I will make a pilgrimage to Mecca. 
174 	EXT. JFK AIRPORT - DAY

BETTY (contd) ...hospitality and true brotherhood as practiced here in the ancient home of Abraham, Mohammad and the great prophets of the Scriptures..." 
177 	INT/EXT. MECCA - DAY/NIGHT 
--Malcolm, wearing the garb of a pilgrim, walks with a VAST THRONG OF OTHERS, similarly clad, around the Great Temple. He wears two white towels, one over his loins, the other over his neck and shoulder, leaving the right arm and shoulder bare. He wears simple sandals. The other pilgrims are of various colors: from white, to yellow, to darkest black. 
177A 	--Malcolm and OTHER PILGRIMS kneeling together on a praying rug. 
177B	--Malcolm and SEVERAL WHITE PILGRIMS eating Muslim-style; breaking a chicken and shaking it. 
177C	--Malcolm and OTHERS walking around the Great Kaaba, a black stone set in the middle of the Great Mosque. He falls to his knees. WE SEE what he describes: 
MALCOLM'S VOICE Today, with thousands of others, I proclaimed God's greatness in the Holy City of Mecca. Wearing the Ihram garb I made my seven circuits around the Kaaba; I drank from the well of Zem Zem; I prayed to Allah from Mt. Ararat where the Ark landed. It was the only time in my life that I stood before the Creator of all and felt like a complete human being. 
178 	INT. ELIJAH'S HOME - NIGHT 
Elijah and a GROUP OF BLACK MUSLIM LEADERS. Bembry among them, it looks like he is the number two man now that Malcolm has been jettisoned. The Messenger lies in bed, he is having a coughing fit, this is the worst condition he's been in. A DOCTOR orders everyone out the room. 
MALCOLM'S VOICE You may be shocked by these words, but I have eaten from the same plate, drunk from the same glass and prayed to the same God with fellow Muslims whose eyes were blue, whose hair was blond and whose skin was the whitest of whites. And we are brothers, truly; people of all colors and races believing in One God and one humanity. Once before, in prison, the truth came and blinded me. It has happened again... 
179 	INT. MALCOLM'S HOME - NIGHT 
Betty is with Brothers Earl, Benjamin 2X, and the children. There are now four including another BABY - GAMILAH 
MALCOLM'S VOICE In the past, I have permitted myself to be used to make sweeping indictments of all white people, and these generalizations have caused injuries to some white folks who did not deserve them. Because of the spiritual rebirth which I was blessed to undergo as a result of my pilgrimage to the Holy City of Mecca, I no longer subscribe to sweeping indictments of one race. I intend to be careful not to sentence anyone who has not been proven guilty. I'm not a racist and do not subscribe to any of the tenets of racism. In all honesty and sincerity it can be stated that I wish nothing but freedom, justice and equality: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all people. 
179A 	SHOT. Malcolm is bent over in prayer, lone figure in a huge mosque. 
MALCOLM'S VOICE My first concern, of course, is with the group to which I belong, the Afro-Americans, for we, more than any other, are deprived of these inalienable rights. 
179B 	SHOT. Malcolm on a plane headed home. 
MALCOLM'S VOICE I believe the true practice of Islam can remove the cancer of racism from the hearts and souls of white Americans. 
180 	EXT. JFK AIRPORT - DAY 
A TIGHT TWO-SHOT of Malcolm and Betty in an embrace. She breaks from him and whispers: "Go ahead. I can wait now." 
181  INT. JFK AIRPORT - DAY 
A large PRESS CONFERENCE: mikes of every network, every newspaper and wire service present. Malcolm sports a beard. 
MALCOLM Let's begin. 
REPORTER #1 Malcolm, you said on your trip abroad you sensed a feeling of great brotherhood. 
MALCOLM As I recall, I pointed out that while I was in Mecca making the pilgrimage, I spoke about the brotherhood that existed at all levels among all people, all colors who had accepted the religion of Islam. I pointed out that what it had done, Islam, for those people despite their complexion differences, that it would probably do America well to study the religion of Islam and perhaps it could drive some of the racism from this society. Muslims look upon themselves as human beings, as part of the human family and therefore look upon all other segments of the human family as part of that same family. Today my friends are black, brown, red, yellow and white. 
REPORTER #8 Malcolm, are you prepared to go to the United Nations at this point and ask that charges be brought against the United States for its treatment of the American Negroes? 
MALCOLM Oh yes. 
The AUDIENCE applauds. 
MALCOLM (contd) The audience will have to be quiet. Yes, as I pointed out that during my trip that nations, African nations, Asian, Latin nations look very hypocritical when they stand up in the UN condemning South Africa and saying nothing about the racist practices that are manifested everyday against Negroes in this society. I would be not a man if I didn't do so. I wouldn't be a man. 
REPORTER #3 Are you prepared to work with some of the leaders of some of the other civil rights organizations? 
MALCOLM Certainly, we will work with any groups, organizations or leaders in any way, as long as it's genuinely designed to get results. 
REPORTER #1 Does the new beard have any religious significance? 
MALCOLM No, not particularly. But I do think that you will And black people in America, as they strive to throw off the shackles of mental colonialism, will also probably reflect an effort to throw off the shackles of cultural colonialism. And then they'll begin to reflect desires of their own with standards of their own. 
REPORTER #2 One of your more controversial remarks was a call for black people to get rifles and form rifle clubs sometime back. Do you still favor that for self-defense? 
MALCOLM I don't see why that should be controversial. I think that if white people found themselves victim of the same kind of brutality that black people in this country face, and they saw that the government was either unwilling or unable to protect them, that the intelligence on the part of the whites would make them get some rifles and protect themselves. 
A car comes roaring down the street with rifles sticking out the windows, and pulls right up in front of Malcolm's house. 
ANGLE - HOUSE 
Brothers Earl and Benjamin 2X run out of the car up to Malcolm. 
BROTHER EARL We called your house, operator said you had requested that your phone be turned off.

BROTHER EARL Let's get out of this cold. 
Brothers Earl and Benjamin take off their coats and put it over Malcolm and lead him to a police car.

BROTHER EARL I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people. 
MALCOLM I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect me. 
There is silence on the other end.

BETTY Dear heart, where are you? 
MALCOLM Is the program ready? 
BENJAMIN 2X No, Brother Minister. 
MALCOLM Why not? You've had ample time, you and the sister. 
SISTER ROBIN I apologize Brother Minister, we'll have it next week. 
He is pissed. 
MALCOLM Folks are sitting out there _today_, not next week, expecting to hear our program. 
BENJAMIN 2X Next week, Brother Minister. 
MALCOLM Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show? 
BROTHER EARL Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend. 
MALCOLM So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night? 
BROTHER EARL I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you? 
MALCOLM Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else. 
BROTHER EARL I assumed... 
MALCOLM What did I tell you about assuming? 
Malcolm starts pacing the room, nobody has ever seen him like this before. 
MALCOLM Benjamin, you better go out there and explain why the program isn't ready today. 
Benjamin 2X gets up to leave. 
MALCOLM Sister, please go with the brother. 
They both exit. 
CLOSE - MALCOLM AND EARL 
BROTHER EARL Brother Minister, what is wrong? 
MALCOLM The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for. 
BROTHER EARL Let's cancel. 
MALCOLM Is my family here yet?

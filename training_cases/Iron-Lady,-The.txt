INT. SHOP. NR CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAWN. 
The HUM of a large refrigerator just audible over the sound of Indian music - MARGARET, briefly glimpsed pondering cartons of milk. The electronic PEEP of the cash til. A man on a mobile phone pushes past MARGARET, who takes her place second in the queue. The female shopkeeper piles newspapers on the counter in front of MARGARET. Distracted by images of the bombed hotel on the TV, she hesitates for beat. 
MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER One forty-nine please. 
MARGARET How much is the milk? 
MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER Forty-nine pence. (taking the change) Thank you. MARGARET turns to leave, jostled by a tall young man wired into an ipod. 
EXT. STREET. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAWN. 
MARGARET heads down the busy street, shopping bag in hand. 
INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY. MARGARET sits at breakfast with her husband DENIS, sipping tea. DENIS butters his toast. MARGARET shakes her head. 
MARGARET Too much. Much too much butter. 
DENIS I like butter. MARGARET Milk's gone up. 
MARGARET reaches for a jug, pouring milk into it, sliding it down on a table. MARGARET (CONT'D) 49p a pint. DENIS Good grief! We'll have to economise. I suppose we could always sell the car. (chuckles) Or take in paying guests! He scoops up the newspaper and glances towards the door - DENIS (CONT'D) Watch out. She's on the prowl. MARGARET looks beyond DENIS to a a sense of growing commotion. A concerned POLICE GUARD coming up the stairs meeting JUNE [early 60's] MARGARET's carer, along a distant corridor, steady on the approach. MARGARET (to DENIS) Eat your egg. JUNE smiles with visible relief on seeing MARGARET, now sitting tapping open her egg. JUNE Goodness! There you are. JUNE's look of quiet concern. MARGARET Yes. MARGARET eats her egg. MARGARET (CONT'D) Here we are. But for JUNE, she is entirely alone. 
INT. CORRIDOR CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY. 
WHISPERING- 
JUNE I don't understand how it happened, how could she possibly have got out? It's very very important - 
MARGARET looks out of the kitchen. Her POV down the corridor of JUNE and the POLICEMAN and a CLEANER. 
JUNE (CONT'D) Please just make it really clear. Who's on after you? 
POLICE GUARD Dixon. 
MARGARET slips away. 
INT.HALL. CHESTER SQUARE. DAY. 
MARGARET hurries through the hall. 
INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAY. 
A wide cupboard- 
MARGARET's eyes move back along the rail in front of her, her fingers touch hanger after hanger of brown tweed and grey twill. 
JUNE goes over to the curtains, pulling them back, letting in the sunlight- 
JUNE Beautiful day. Oh, you've made a start. Carol's coming soon, I'll get some bags. Anything you want to go to Mark, I'll bring up a suitcase for it. 
The smell of smoke lingering. Suddenly DENIS' hand reaches across, wavering between jackets of brown tweed and grey twill- 
He reaches for a suit. 
MARGARET Wear your scarf. There's a chill out there. 
Suddenly looming over her and grinning down as if at the top of a tunnel SUSIE, MARGARET's personal secretary carrying a cardboard box. 
SUSIE Good morning Lady Thatcher. Are you alright ? (concerned) How are you feeling ? 
MARGARET I'm fine, thank you Susie. 
SUSIE I've just been reading about the bombings. 
MARGARET Yes. Frightful. 
SUSIE's mobile goes off.    She fumbles in her bag to switch it off. 
SUSIE Sorry. 
SUSIE (CONT'D) These are the books for you to sign. I brought as many as I could find. Shall we go through your appointments? 
MARGARET looks at her still nonplussed. 
SUSIE (CONT'D) We said we'd go through them today. 
MARGARET nods- 
MARGARET Yes, of course, dear. Today. 
SUSIE The invitation has come from Downing Street for the unveiling of your portrait. I'll put it on the mantelpiece, and there's an invitation from Lord Armstrong for lunch on the first Friday of next month. 
The murmur of SUSIE's voice, a kind of white noise- 
SUSIE (O.S.) (CONT'D) I said no because you've got a concert that afternoon but if you'd like to..? 
SILENCE- 
SUSIE(O.S) (CONT'D) ....It looks like a very interesting programme. 
MARGARET's listens, oddly distracted- 
MARGARET What are they playing? 
SUSIE looks at her momentarily at a loss then scrabbles back through the diary- 
SUSIE I think they said Rogers and Hammerstein. 
`SHALL WE DANCE' FROM `THE KING & I" SUDDENLY BREAKING THROUGH AS IF FROM ANOTHER TIME CARRYING INTO.... 
INT. SADLER'S WELLS. LONDON. 1950. NIGHT. 
An orchestra in full flight- 
A programme for THE KING & I on a woman's lap. A man's hand reaches in and her hands slips into his. 
INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY. 
Whilst SUSIE shuffles through the arrangements at the desk in the background, MARGARET stands at the window. 
MARGARET Silly man. 
MARGARET's gaze, seeing DENIS just visible in the street below. He looks up, smiles, 
MARGARET (CONT'D) He hasn't got his scarf on. 
A phone rings, O.S. 
MARGARET considers DENIS now wearing a pink turban and confronts the extraordinary head-gear. 
MARGARET What have you got on your head? 
DENIS smiles, throwing back his head, the swathe of pink fabric from his turban hanging down ridiculously- 
DENIS Found it in the cupboard and thought bugger it, it's Friday, why not fancy dress? 
MARGARET sits drinking her tea, JUNE's hushed tones almost audible. 
MARGARET You look ridiculous. 
MARGARET strains to hear- 
DENIS Bosslady no like? 
She makes a shushing motion. 
MARGARET (as if to a bad dog) No, Denis, Bosslady no like. 
MARGARET resumes listening. The door ajar, the sounds of life just audible outside- 
JUNE (O.S) It's taken Carol so long to get her to agree to this. She's been so reluctant to let his things go. 
DENIS sinks onto the bed, bored. 
MARGARET (without looking) Feet. 
He tuts and adjusts his legs so that his shoes don't dirty the bedspread. 
MARGARET stands, ear pressed close to the open door- 
JUNE (O.S) You can never be sure she's taking her medication...I think sometimes she hides them.. 
DENIS VO Oh, rumbled! 
MARGARET looks back at her cup of tea, spots two pills resting in the tea cup. 
She considers the pills, pops them in her mouth, drinks. 
JUNE (O.S) She's definitely more distracted than usual today. 
INT/EXT. BEDROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY. 
A shout in the street. A woman's voice. 
CAROL OOV Can I suggest you remove the sticker from the back of your car. 
Margaret looks through the net curtains and sees CAROL THATCHER[early 50's] just visible stepping out of a taxi, remonstrating with the driver, clutching her purse and waving her credit card at him with rising irritation. 
CAROL OOV (CONT'D) Well then take the sticker off! I call that false advertising! I would say keep the change, but there isn't any change. 
INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY. 
A scotch being poured. The cap not quite going back on the whisky bottle. A frantic fumble for the remotes for the tv. 
CAROL OOV Hello June, any news? I've brought every bag I could find. 
High shot of MARGARET sitting in a chair watching TV. As if she has been there a while. 
MARGARET (standing up) We must release a statement, offering our condolences. 
CAROL I'm sure they've already- 
MARGARET We must never, ever, ever give in to terrorists. 
MARGARET sees JUNE and CAROL exchange looks of `oh dear...' 
INT.BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DUSK. 
MARGARET sits in a dressing gown at a dressing table, staring at her reflection. CAROL stands behind her, holding up several dresses. 
CAROL Now ma, are we going long or just below the knee tonight? 
MARGARET Oh, below the knee I should think. 
She watches, irritated, as CAROL reaches to move a pile of DENIS' clothes- 
MARGARET (CONT'D) No! Don't move those. I haven't finished sorting them. 
CAROL settles beside her on a chair. 
CAROL I hear you went out today...You mustn't go out on your own Mummy. We've talked about that. 
MARGARET There was no milk. 
CAROL Call Robert he'll get it for you if June's not up- 
MARGARET I am not for the knackers yet. 
From behind- 
DENIS (O.S) Now take it easy, Margaret. 
DENIS just visible, perched on the bed, looks up from doing the crossword in the newspaper- 
CAROL No one is saying that. 
MARGARET If I can't go out to buy a pint of milk then what is the world coming to. Really Carol, please don't fuss about it. You've always been like this, fuss fuss fuss. You must find something better to do with your time. It's most unattractive in a woman. When I was your age the last thing I wanted to do was fuss around my mother. 
Silence- 
CAROL, inwardly stung quietly busying herself, forcing all emotion away. 
MARGARET hesitates catching DENIS' eye, with quiet warning. 
DENIS Four down, 9 letters. 
DENIS withdraws into his crossword. 
DENIS (CONT'D) Something b something t something n...something something somthing...Refusal to change course- 
MARGARET Obstinate. 
DENIS writes, pleased. 
CAROL looks up, with quiet bemusement- 
CAROL What? 
MARGARET deflects, pointing to a necklace in CAROL's hands. 
INT. DINING ROOM. HOUSE. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING. 
DENIS whispers. 
DENIS VO ...and work your way in. 
A long table packed with silverware. She looks back at her ornate and rather hideous starter, a tiny wobbling savoury confection in aspic. 
PORTLY HOST ...Attlee has his sights set on the steel industry, you mark my words. 
GREY SUITED MAN They'll be nationalizing the bloody air next. 
MALE GUEST Yes, hold your breath, sir, that's government property! 
PORTLY HOST So was your father a political man, too, Miss Roberts? 
MARGARET Oh, yes, to his core. And Mayor of Grantham. 
PORTLY HOST And a grocer as well! 
MARGARET Yes. 
Ears prick up around the table. The Host is lost for something to say. 
HOSTESS And did you help, err, in the...shop? 
MARGARET Oh, yes. It was a family business. 
GREY SUITED MAN A very good starting point for the political life, I'm sure. 
MARGARET That and a degree from Oxford. 
The put-down, though not intentional, causes Denis to smile. 
MARGARET catches the smile. She remains unruffled and goes back to her food, picking up a knife and fork, working her way in, teasing her hors d'oeuvres. 
INT. DINING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE.LONDON.PRESENT.EVENING. 
MARGARET sits oddly removed, hand instinctively covering her wine glass, as a WINE WAITER hovers. 
MARGARET (hushed aside to WAITER) Whisky. 
The MURMUR of conversation all around- 
INT. DINING ROOM. HOUSE. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING. 
Pudding is on the go and Margaret is warming to her theme. 
MARGARET What I do think is that a man should be encouraged to stand on his own two feet. Yes we help people of course we help people. But for those that can do, they must just get up and do. And if something's wrong, they shouldn't just whine about it, they should get in there and DO something about it, change things. 
The female guests exchange glances. A half-chuckle from someone. 
PORTLY HOST With all due respect, Miss Roberts, what may have served in Grantham- 
MARGARET Can serve very well for the people of Dartford too. 
MALE GUEST Really? 
A general sense of quiet incredulity. 
MARGARET I know much more than those who have never lived on a limited income. Just like the man or woman on the street, when I am short one week, I have to make economies the next. 
MARGARET says final farewells to a guest. He walks away as another couple approach. 
MARGARET You don't mind if I sit down... 
Sitting down on a nearby chair, MARGARET looks with feigned recollection at the FEMALE GUEST as she sinks down on the ground in front of her, gripping MARGARET's hand. 
FEMALE GUEST I heard you speak at conference in 1984 in Brighton just after the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel. You were remarkable. I hope you appreciate what an inspiration you have been for women like myself. 
MARGARET hesitates, smiles, nods to herself, considering- 
MARGARET It used to be about trying to do something. Now its about trying to be someone. 
The FEMALE GUEST nods and scrambled to her feet, clearly concerned, shooting a look to her HUSBAND standing beside her, waiting to depart. 
FEMALE GUEST Well anyway, I...thank you. 
MARGARET Good night to you. 
MARGARET sits alone. In the background, the chatter of Carol saying final farewells. 
CAROL (O.S.) Great to see you, thank you very much for coming. 
MALE GUEST (O.S.) Oh, thank you. It was lovely, absolutely lovely. And I'm so pleased to see your mother looking so well. 
INT. DRESSING ROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT.NIGHT. 
A mirror lined dressing room- 
CAROL helps MARGARET with her shoes. 
CAROL OK...hold on to me...that's right. 
MARGARET struggles with the catch on her pearls 
MARGARET Can you do the clasp, I can't quite - 
CAROL hurries to help her, MARGARET quietly concedes. Fingers fumble to unclasp the pearls- 
MARGARET (CONT'D) Thank you. 
CAROL drops the pearls into a jewelry box, close to MARGARET, staring back at their reflections. 
CAROL You've got an eyelash. 
CAROL catches the stray eyelash on the tip of her finger, holding it close to MARGARET, with a smile- 
CAROL (CONT'D) Make a wish. 
MARGARET, closes her eyes until- 
MARGARET blows. She opens them smiles. CAROL smiles. 
CAROL (CONT'D) I spoke to Doctor Michael today- 
MARGARET glances away, deflecting. 
CAROL (CONT'D) He is very good and very expensive- 
MARGARET ignores her- 
CAROL (CONT'D) ...I know you're not due to see him for another month but I've spoken to him and he can fit you in tomorrow. 
MARGARET almost smiles. Then sinks once more into misery. 
MARGARET Disaster. 
DENIS Hang on...Hang on...Hang on... 
DENIS fishes in his pocket pulling out a hip flask. An impromptu supper made. MARGARET takes in the aftermath of rosettes, the whiff of defeat all around. 
DENIS (CONT'D) You shaved thousands off their majority. You did splendidly. 
MARGARET Not splendidly enough. 
DENIS Ah I see. Self pity. 
MARGARET eyes him, mid chip- 
DENIS (CONT'D) No one is saying you don't need a safe seat. You deserve a safe seat. But it does not come unless you learn to play the game a little. 
MARGARET What game? 
She is fuming but he regroups with a big breath. 
DENIS You are a grocer's daughter- 
MARGARET (fiercely) -And proud of being- 
He grabs her hand, silencing her. 
DENIS - in their eyes. A single grocer's daughter. But if you were to become the wife of a moderately successful businessman- 
For the first time, we see MARGARET taken by surprise. 
DENIS (CONT'D) You'd get to parliament, and I'd get to be the happiest man in- in wherever they select you. (SILENCE) Margaret, will you marry me? 
She is genuinely stunned. 
DENIS (CONT'D) Well ? 
She is frozen. Then she begins to smile and nod her head and smile. 
MARGARET Yes. Yes! 
He leans over and kisses her, long and passionately until- 
DENIS What ? 
MARGARET I love you so much but...I will never be one of those women Denis - who stays silent and pretty on the arm of her husband. Or remote and alone in the kitchen doing the washing up for that matter. 
DENIS (trying to retain the moment) We'll get a help for that. 
He leans forward to kiss her again but she pulls away a little. 
MARGARET No - one's life must matter, Denis. Beyond the cooking and the cleaning and the children, one's life must mean more than that - I cannot die washing up a tea cup. 
He sits up and stares as if seeing her for the first time. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) I mean it Denis, say you understand. 
DENIS That's why I want to marry you, my dear. 
She kisses him. 
HEATH (CONT'D) I'm sure we are all in agreement that we must do nothing for the moment that will further inflame the current situation. 
MINISTER 1 Hear hear, Prime Minister. 
MARGARET leans forward for a better view, trying to catch his eye. HEATH wavers, mid-speech. All turn to look at MARGARET - who sits unwavering. HEATH resumes. 
HEATH - the fact of the matter is, it's absolutely crucial that we are seen by the public to be acting as conciliators and not aggressors. (Finally acknowledging Margaret) Yes, Education Secretary. 
MARGARET Yes... 
All eyes TURN on her again, hearing the reservation in her voice. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) Prime Minister, with the Miners' leader calling today for the army to mutiny in support of the strikes, this seems the wrong time for conciliation. 
SUDDENLY ALL THE LIGHTS GO OUT. 
A lot of `bloody hell' `oh for god's sake'. 
HEATH Be patient. They'll come back on in a minute. 
A beam of light cuts through, just for an instant picking out HEATH'S moon-like face surrounded by darkness. MARGARET holds the small torch. 
HEATH (CONT'D) Thank you, Margaret. 
A snigger, then the lights flicker back on. 
HEATH (CONT'D) Your thoughts are duly noted. 
MARGARET turns of the torch and clicks her handbag shut in satisfaction. Heath's words echo in her head, `compromise...compromise...compromise...' An inward look as she's caught by a memory. 
ALFRED (O.S.) We on this island are strong. We're self-reliant. Napoleon called us a nation of shopkeepers. 
INT. TOWN HALL. 1949. NIGHT. The packed town hall, ALFRED ROBERTS in full flow on stage. 
ALFRED He meant it as an insult but to me it's a compliment. That's why he couldn't beat us, and that's why Hitler can't beat us. 
The crowd of men applaud. The lone woman in their midst, YOUNG MARGARET watches her father, face aglow. 
ALFRED (CONT'D) We Conservatives believe in giving people the freedom and opportunity to fulfil their own potential, especially the young. There's no good in pretending we're all equal, we're not all the same, never have been, never will be. We should encourage our children to aspire to achieve more than we have, for our children today will be the leaders of tomorrow. 
INT. CAR. STREET. CENTRAL LONDON. 1974. DAWN ...CAROL and MARGARET seated, driving steadily along a deserted street. MARGARET thoughtful as the radio plays. 
VOICE ON THE RADIO It's 1974 and you'd think it was WWII. Blackouts, no petrol. It's a mess. Heath should resign now and make way for someone who's not afraid to tackle the unions. 
CAROL'S nervous prattle begins to break through. 
CAROL I swear, it's all gone completely out of my head. My driving instructor thinks I should pass but I feel as if I've hardly had any lessons. Ridiculous isn't it? Maybe third time lucky. MARGARET Right. The only thing you should remember is that everyone else is either reckless or inept. And often both. MARGARET eyes the road, gesturing CAROL to move forward. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) One must be brave if one is to take the wheel- 
CAROL Right-o. 
MARGARET Move over... Move to your right a little bit... 
CAROL But if I move to the right aren't I on the wrong side of the road? 
MARGARET Carol! 
CAROL Well he's in the way! 
MARGARET To the right. Move to the right! A yelp from CAROL as the car swerves a little, narrowly missing a lone CYCLIST- MARGARET (CONT'D) So sorry! Terribly sorry! MARGARET throws a wave from the wound down window. The CYCLIST swerves on recognizing her, watching as the car goes round and round the square, almost balletic. 
DENIS Too busy climbing the greasy pole MT. 
Cutting in - 
INTERVIEWER (O.S.) Mrs Thatcher I understand you recently visited the United States of America. 
MARGARET'S attention is caught by an old interview, playing on the TV. She leans forward. On screen, she sits in a neat hat, leaning forward eagerly. 
INTERVIEWER (CONT'D) What was it you took away from that visit which may be of value here in Great Britain? 
INT. STUDIO. LONDON. 1975. NIGHT 
MARGARET perched on a chair, smiling at the TV INTERVIEWER - 
MARGARET Oh that's rather easy to answer, actually. They are unafraid of success. 
INT. REECE'S OFFICE. LONDON. 1975. DAY MARGARET is watching the same interview on a TV monitor. She is watching herself intently, as are REECE and AIREY NEAVE. They are polar opposites, REECE flamboyant to NEAVE's bluff. 
She sounds very plummy, like a Conservative party wife from the shires. And she wears a hat. 
MARGARET ON TELEVISION We in Great Britain and in Europe are formed mainly by our history. They on the other hand are formed by their philosophy. Not by what has been, but by what can be. Oh, we have a great deal that we can learn from them, yes. Oh yes! 
MARGARET is trapped in the moment - but the two men exchange a glance. NEAVE freezes the picture. MARGARET smiles uneasily, like someone expecting a compliment. REECE considers her, long and hard. It is a little unsettling until- REECE Well er...For a start, that hat has got to go. And the pearls. In fact I think all hats may have to go. You look and sound like a privileged Conservative wife and we've already got her vote. You've got lovely hair but we need to do something with it - to make it more- 
AIREY NEAVE Important. 
REECE Yes. Give it more impact. But the main thing is your voice. Its too high. It has no authority. 
AIREY NEAVE Methinks the Lady doth screech too much 
REECE People don't want to be harangued by a woman or hectored. Persuaded yes. That `oh yes' at the end of the interview, that's authoritative, that's the voice of a leader. MARGARET stares at him. 
MARGARET It's all very well to talk about changing my voice, Mr Reece, but for some of my colleagues to imagine me as their leader would be like imagining, I don't know, being led into battle by their chambermaid. It's my background, and my sex. No matter how I've tried, and I have tried, to fit in, I will never be truly one of them. Both REECE and NEAVE are aware that she has spoken very nakedly - and is thus extremely vulnerable. REECE If I may say so - I think that's your trump card. You're flying in the face of everything the Tories have been thus far. It's really very exciting. One simply has to maximise your appeal, bring out all your qualities and make you look, and sound, like the leader that you could be. 
NEAVE You've got it in you to go the whole distance. 
REECE Absolutely. 
MARGARET Prime Minister?! Oh no. Oh no no no. In Britain? There will be no female Prime Minister here, not in my lifetime. No. And I told Airey, I don't expect to win the leadership, but I am going to run. Just to shake up the party. NEAVE moves in intently- NEAVE Respectfully, Margaret, I disagree. If you want to change this party, lead it. If you want to change the country, lead it. What we're talking about here today is surface. What's crucial is that you hold your course, and stay true to who you are. Never be anything other than yourself. MARGARET, though flattered, looks sceptical. 
REECE Leave us to do the rest. A BEAT MARGARET Gentlemen, I am in your hands. I may be persuaded to surrender the hat. But the pearls were a gift from my husband on the birth of our twins and they are absolutely non-negotiable. MARGARET smiles at them. 
INT. REHEARSAL ROOM. NATIONAL THEATRE. LONDON. 1975. DAY MARGARET stands humming, a THEATRICAL COACH presses her hand to MARGARET'S stomach. THEATRICAL VOICE COACH And...bring it down. MARGARET hums lower, tries to project her voice. 
MARGARET Maaaaaaaaaaaa. 
THEATRICAL VOICE COACH Good, I think we can loose the handbag, Mrs Thatcher...Hands down the sides...Because this isn't really about the voice, it's about belief...A nice deep breath. REECE and NEAVE are watching and monitoring the performance. DENIS, though present, is having a crafty fag by the window. 
THEATRICAL VOICE COACH (CONT'D) If you're calling Mr Thatcher, how would you do that? MARGARET looks over at him. MARGARET (calls) Denis. He doesn't react. 
THEATRICAL VOICE COACH Yes, I want more authority, I want conviction, I want - 
MARGARET (a little more authority) Denis. 
THEATRICAL VOICE COACH That's right, one more time, deep breath - She puts on her new, lower voice. MARGARET Denis. And DENIS reacts immediately, like a guilty thing surprised, stabbing out his cigarette, turning quickly towards her. DENIS Yes MT! 
EXT. YARD. ICE CREAM FACTORY. DAY. 
MARGARET makes her way through a crowd of applauding workers in crisp white uniforms. Like them, she wears a white cap on her head. 
MARGARET You are the backbone of our nation! Small firms like Loveday's Ice Cream. How are you? So nice to meet you ladies. 
NEWS V.O. The Irish National Liberation Army has claimed responsibility for the death of Airey Neave, Margaret Thatcher's spokesman on Northern Ireland. 
INT. CONFERENCE HALL. NIGHT. 
MARGARET on the conference podium, blinking back tears. Behind her, Denis' face etched with the same sorrow. 
INT. STEPS. HOUSE OF COMMONS. DAY 
MARGARET walks alone down the grand stairway, sombre, deep in thought. 
INT. CORRIDOR. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY. 
MARGARET looks up from the photograph, tears in her eyes. 
AIREY NEAVE (V.O.) If you want to change the party, lead it. (MORE) 
AIREY NEAVE (V.O.) (CONT'D) If you want to change the country, lead it. You've got it in you to go the whole distance! 
On MARGARET as memories flood in. A TV headline announces: ELECTION 1979. 
INT. CONFERENCE HALL. NIGHT 
MARGARET on the podium. 
MARGARET Now, as the test draws near, I ask your help. That together we can shake off the shackles of socialism and restore to greatness this country that we love so much. And the only way is for the Conservative Party to win! 
The black streak of MARGARET'S car, a blur of colour, faces, waving flags - 
TV footage of polling night. Swingometers, pollsters, impressionistic snatches of reported speech. 
More footage of PEOPLE coming out of polling stations. 
Jubilant crowds applauding.. 
MARGARET, silhouetted in her iconic stance, arms aloft... 
INT. CAR. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1979. DAY. 
MARGARET peering out of the window, hands sunk in the lap, a flash of the Royal blue fabric of her skirt, clenched in fingers. 
NEWS READER (V.O.) It's Friday the 4th of May, an historic day for Britain, a Conservative government led by Mrs. Thatcher is set to lead - 
NEWS READER 2 (V.O.) Mrs Ghandi in India, but never in the West has there been a woman Prime Minister. 
NEW READER 3 (V.O.) The place that she has secured in British history, as the first woman ever to be invited to form a government. (MORE) 
NEW READER 3 (V.O.) (CONT'D) The bonus of one of the most famous addresses in the world, Number 10 Downing Street. 
NOISE. FLAGS. BANNERS read `We LOVE YOU MAGGIE' blur through the window, an abstract cacophony of noise and colour- 
DENIS This is it, steady the buffs old girl. 
He clasps her hand for a moment as MARGARET smiles at him. 
The door swings open- 
EXT. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1979. DAY. 
The CAMERA from behind on MARGARET rising up out of the car, to face a waiting PRESS CORP. The jostle of a POLICE OFFICER, DENIS and OTHERS press her either side- 
MARGARET I should just like to say that I take very seriously the trust the British people placed in me today, and I will work hard every day to live up to that responsibility. And now, I should like to share with you a prayer of St Francis of Assisi: Where there is discord may we bring harmony... Where there is error may we bring truth... Where there is doubt may we bring faith... Where there is despair may we bring hope.. 
MARGARET is furious. 
MARGARET Don't try to hide you opinions. Goodness me, I'd much rather you were honest and straightforward about them - instead of continuously and damagingly leaking them to the press. Well? 
MOMENTARILY SILENT- 
MARGARET's eyes travel around the room in waiting- 
PYM Well, people can't pay their mortgages. 
GILMOUR The manufacturing industry is practically on its knees. 
PYM Honest, hard-working, decent people are losing their homes. It's terribly shameful. 
GILMOUR The point is, Prime Minister, that we must moderate the pace - 
HESELTINE - if we're even to have a hope of winning the next election- 
PYM Quite right. 
MARGARET Ah. Worried about our careers, are we? 
They make noises - to the effect that nothing could be further from the truth. 
But MARGARET has their measure. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) Gentlemen, if we don't cut spending we will be bankrupt. Yes the medicine is harsh but the patient requires it in order to live. Shall we withhold the medicine? No! We are not wrong. We did not seek election and win in order to manage the decline of a great nation. (MORE) 
MARGARET (CONT'D) The people of this country chose us because they believe we can restore the health of the British economy and we will do just that! Barring a failure of nerve. 
The SNAP OF COTTON - 
MARGARET looks at them in a cold fury... 
MARGARET (CONT'D) Anything else? 
SILENCE- 
MARGARET nods to the seamstress, dismissing her- 
MARGARET (CONT'D) Thank you. You saved the day once again, Crawfie, you're an angel. 
MARGARET straightens her cuff, testing the button, as the meeting slowly disbands and the MINISTERS move away. 
HOWE You can't close down a discussion because it's not what you wish to hear. 
MARGARET I don't expect everyone just to sit there and agree with me. But what kind of leader am I if I don't try to get my own way - to do what I know to be right. 
HOWE Yes. But Margaret, one must be careful of testing one's colleagues' loyalty too far. 
MARGARET glances up watching the MINISTERS disappearing, in whispered conversation, like conspirators. 
(ARCHIVE FOOTAGE) Rioting in Brixton, burning cars, huge civil unrest - 
TV JOURNALIST (V.O.) We are now one split nation, with a huge gulf dividing the employed from the unemployed. 
(ARCHIVE FOOTAGE) Protest marches, `People's March for Jobs', `No pit closures" - 
UNION ACTIVIST (V.O.) The Thatcher plan is to break the Trade Union movement. 
MARGARET (V.O.) There must be closures of uneconomic coal mines, we seek only an efficient industry. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) (more desperate) Denis- there you are. Are you alright? 
DENIS ghostlike, covered in dust, still in his pyjamas, holding up an obliterated pair of shoes. 
DENIS My shoes! 
Beyond, the wall of the bathroom entirely blown away - 
The CAW of gulls- 
EXT. GRAND HOTEL. BRIGHTON. 1984. NIGHT. 
Chaos outside the Grand Hotel in the aftermath of the bomb. 
The WHIR of SIRENS- 
DENIS and MARGARET sit in their car, looking out in silent shock at the devastated Grand hotel, reflected on the glass of the car windows. 
MARGARET (V.O.) That's when I thought I'd lost you. 
A TELEPHONE RINGS CUTTING THROUGH FROM ANOTHER TIME... 
INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. NIGHT. 
MARGARET wakes with a start, confused and fumbles for the telephone by her bed- 
MARGARET (picking up phone) Mark?... Hello darling... No, I'm fine... I'm very well... 
MARGARET squints, fingers fumbling for DENIS' watch. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) How is... How's... Sarah?... And the children..? 
MARGARET sits up - 
MARGARET (CONT'D) ...Oh... You can't... That's a pity... I was hoping to see you... No really darling... That's fine... Of course... another time... Lovely Darling... Can't wait...Yes... 
MARGARET suddenly relents, a flicker of sudden and urgent need, caught in her eyes- 
MARGARET (CONT'D) (beat) Mark? 
Silence- 
MARK gone. MARGARET hangs up, stares at- 
I Whistle A Happy Tune from the King and I just audible- 
INT. DRAWING ROOM.CHESTER SQUARE.PRESENT.NIGHT. 
MARGARET stands in the doorway, a jaunty "I Whistle A Happy Tune" seeping from the television. 
MARGARET That was Mark. Not able to come. 
DENIS (cutting in) Boy's always going AWOL. 
MARGARET Well it costs him a great deal to fly everyone up here. 
DENIS There you go, making excuses for him. Now look where it's got you. 
DENIS stands dressed in dinner jacket and bow tie as he reads the back of "The King and I" DVD. 
DENIS (CONT'D) Did you know Yul Brynner was a gypsy from Vladivostok? 
ADMIRAL LEACH (V.O.) We have to go now. 
MARGARET (V.O.) The government has now decided that a large task force will sail, as soon as all preparations are complete. 
INTERCUT (ARCHIVE FOOTAGE) the Task Force sets sail. 
INT. DRAWING ROOM. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1982. DAY 
MARGARET paces, deep in thought. 
MP 1 (O.S.) Prime Minister we do still have three weeks before our ships reach the islands. 
MP 2 (O.S.) All we're saying is that we shouldn't give up on trying to find a diplomatic solution. 
INT. CORRIDOR. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1982. DAY. 
A tea trolley and an American entourage surge down a Downing Street corridor. 
MP 1 The U.S. Secretary of State has arrived, Prime Minister. 
INT. DRAWING ROOM. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1982. DAY 
Haig and Margaret sit facing each other, flanked by senior ministers. 
GENERAL HAIG So you are proposing to go to war over these Islands. They're thousands of miles away, a handful of citizens, politically and economically... insignificant, if you'll excuse me - 
MARGARET Just like Hawaii, I imagine. 
GENERAL HAIG I'm sorry? 
MARGARET 1941, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbour. Did America go cap in hand and ask Tojo for a peaceful negotiation of terms? Did she turn her back on her own citizens there because the islands were thousands of miles from mainland United States? No, no, no! We will stand on principle or we shall not stand at all. 
GENERAL HAIG But Margaret with all due respect when one has been to war.... 
MARGARET With all due respect sir, I have done battle every single day of my life, and many men have underestimated me before. This lot seem bound to do the same but they will rue the day. 
BEAT 
MARGARET turns to a tea trolley close by- 
MARGARET (CONT'D) Now, shall I be mother? 
HAGUE looks confused, MARGARET lifting the teapot- 
MARGARET (CONT'D) Tea, Al, how do you take your tea? Black or white? 
INT. CENTRE OF OPERATIONS. 1982. DAY. 
NAVAL MEN murmuring messages quietly to NAVAL ATTACHES. Male lips to male ears, something MARGARET has seen all her life. FRANCIS PYM and JOHN NOTT stand near MARGARET. 
INTERCUT (STOCK FOOTAGE) the naval fleet sails towards the Falklands. 
A map of South Georgia and the Falkland Islands. Model boats sit on the water, flags sit on the islands. Argentinian flags. MARGARET stares at the map. A whispered message to one of the ATTACHES. He moves a model boat on the map a few inches, leading a fleet of smaller model boats. 
NAVAL ATTACHE 1 The Argentinian ship the General Belgrano and her escorts are pursuing course 273 degrees toward the Argentinian mainland. We are tracking it with our submarine HMS Conqueror. 
He points to a model submarine at some distance from the Argentinian boats. 
MARGARET Is this ship a threat? 
ADMIRAL FIELDHOUSE Both of these ships are carrying Exocet missiles, Prime Minister. Just yesterday they launched- then aborted- an attack inside the exclusion zone. There is a risk they could try it again. 
MARGARET The families. I must write to them... 
INT. DOWNING STREET. STUDY.    1982. NIGHT. 
MARGARET at her desk, looks up at Pym. 
MARGARET Foreign Secretary... 
PYM I've just been briefed by Admiral Fieldhouse. (MORE) 
PYM (CONT'D) He told me bluntly that if the Argentinians are prepared and willing to risk their aircraft, they have enough missiles to cripple most of our fleet. 
A beat. 
JOHN NOTT President Reagan and President Bellaunde of Peru have some new proposals for the peace plan - 
MARGARET (sharply) The peace plan? There will be no appeasement. This is a war. A war they started and by God, we will finish. Shall I tell you what I'm going to write to every single one of these families, these heartbroken families? I am going to tell them that no British soldier will die in vain for the Falklands. 
INTERCUT (STOCK FOOTAGE) muddy mass graves as the Falklands dead are buried. 
MILITARY VOICE Lieutenant Colonel Jones. Captain Wood. Captain Dench. Lieutenant Farlaine. Corporal Hardman. Corporal Sullivan. Corporal Briar. 
MARGARET writes to each of the families. 
MARGARET (V.O.) As the only Prime Minister in the history of our country who is also a mother with a son of my own, I can imagine your agony, and your grief. 
INTERCUT (STOCK FOOTAGE) troops march through barren landscapes, helicopters hover, a British flag. 
MINISTER (V.O.) Prime Minister, we have secured the beachhead - 
NEWS ANNOUNCERS (O.S.) The Argentinian troops are demoralized and ill equipped...The paratroops have taken Goose Green... 
RADIO VO Shortly after dark last night, our forces executed what our Commander in Chief has called a brilliant surprise night attack. 
MARGARET sits at a desk in Downing Street, listening to the news reports. A hand turns off the radio. 
DENIS Thatcher, bed. 
He heads down the hall, MARGARET following behind. 
RADIO From their new positions, our forces can see large numbers of Argentine soldiers retreating and streaming back into Port Stanley. Our forces are moving forward to exploit their success. 
INTERCUT (ARCHIVE FOOTAGE) Victory! The Union Jack is raised over Port Stanley. The task force return to England to scenes of jubilation. Embraces, balloons, joyful embraces. 
INT. CAR. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1982. DUSK. 
MARGARET peering out, a sea of union jacks and bunting. Cheers, the street lined as the car pulls into Downing Street- 
The blur of noise, cheering, jostling banners THEN the shroud of black uniforms suddenly encasing the car, blocking out the light- 
The jaunty distant sound of a military band playing- 
DENIS O/S Well done, M. 
The car door swings open- 
A CACOPHONY of CHEERS, APPLAUSE, just audible far off, as MARGARET steps out into the street, the CAMERA follows her out peering up at- 
DOWNING STREET STAFF leaning out of No 10 windows, waving flags and cheering- 
MARGARET's gaze lingering on HOWE and PYM amongst them, smiling with congratulations, clearly now part of the victory celebrations. 
A journalist stands outside the Commons making his report. 
NEWS JOURNALIST - that there must be a change in that style of management. That Mrs Thatcher must listen more, and on occasion, give in. 
INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS HALLWAY, 1990. DAY. 
MARGARET moving swiftly down the hall, leaving her cabinet in her wake. 
PYM (O.S.) The point is, Prime Minister, I don't think we can sell the idea of a tax that asks everyone to pay the same. 
MARGARET (V.O.) Our policies may be unpopular, but they are the right policies. 
MINISTER 1 (V.O.) Prime Minister I just don't think we can ask the poorest of the poor to pay the same amount of tax as a multi-millionaire. 
INT. CABINET ROOM. DOWNING STREET. 1990. DAY 
MARGARET, seated at the wide cabinet table surrounded by a subdued CABINET. Most of the familiar old faces - PYM, HESELTINE, etc. All now gone. 
HOWE the last enduring minister. 
She casts a gimlet-eye over the GREY-SUITED MEN around her. 
MARGARET There it is again! Why not? 
MINISTER 1 Because - 
MINISTER 2 Because people... on the whole... think that the tax is manifestly unfair. 
MARGARET Nonsense. Arrant nonsense. This is a simple proposition. In order to live in this country, you must pay for the privilege- something, anything! If you pay nothing, you care nothing. What do you care where you throw your rubbish? Your council estate is a mess, your town, graffiti, what do you care? It's not your problem , it's somebody else's problem- it's the government's problem! YOUR problem is, some of you, is that you haven't got the courage for this fight. You haven't had to fight hard for anything. It's all been given to you- and you feel guilty about it! Well, may I say, on behalf of all those who HAVE had to fight their way up, (and who don't feel guilty about it) we resent those slackers who take, take, take, and contribute nothing to the community! 
SILENCE. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) And I see the same thing, the same cowardice in our fight within the European Union, to retain British sovereignty of Britain, the integrity of the pound! Some of you want to make concessions. I hear some of you agree with the latest French proposals. (beat) Well, why don't you get on a boat to Calais? Yes, why don't you put on a beret, and pay 85% of your income to the French government! 
She has subdued them utterly. The silence is terrible. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) Right. What can we realistically hope to achieve by the end of session, Lord President? (MORE) 
MARGARET (CONT'D) And why have we not made more progress to date? What is that? Is that the timetable? I haven't seen that. May I see it? 
HOWE Here it is, Prime Minister. Of course. 
HOWE pushes the papers over to her. She picks up a pencil, starts to read. 
The MINISTERS watch as, quickly, she starts to score through the words. 
MARGARET The wording is sloppy here, and here. 
HOWE If you say so. 
MARGARET I do say so. 
HOWE It's merely a first draft... 
MARGARET looks down at the paperwork. 
MARGARET This is ridiculous. There are two "T's" in "committee"! 
She presses so hard that her pencil breaks, so she shoves the paper back towards him, stabbing a finger at the offending word. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) This is shameful. Shameful! I can't even rely on you for a simple timetable! Are you unwell? Yes you are unwell. Give me the pencil, give it to me! 
MINISTER 4 (O.S.) She behaved appallingly. I wouldn't have spoken to my gamekeeper like that. 
MINISTER 1 (O.S.) I don't think she can survive this. 
INT. STUDY. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1990. NIGHT. MARGARET stands, watching the evening news, HESELTINE just visible on the TV screen- HESELTINE ON TV I'm here to announce my decision to put my name forward as leader of the Conservative party. I have nothing but admiration for our Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, but I believe our party and our country need a new leader. MARGARET turns to DENIS, who stands, clearly shocked, worst fears confirmed. 
TV JOURNALIST It's extraordinary. The rules of the Conservative Party make it possible for Conservative MP's to depose a sitting Prime Minister. 
MARGARET and DENIS on the sofa. She unwraps a sweet, eyes locked on the TV. 
MARGARET I am the Prime Minister. 
Turning to Denis. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) (offering the packet) Sweetie? 
(STOCK FOOTAGE) WESTMINSTER in the moonlight -

EXT. PARIS STREET. NIGHT 
With the Eiffel Tower illuminated behind him, Trevor MacDonald makes his report. 
TREVOR MACDONALD Tonight in Paris Mrs Thatcher is among thirty four world leaders who came together to celebrate the end of the Cold War and herald the start of a peaceful new age of East/West cooperation. 
INT. GRAND HALL. PARIS. NIGHT. 
A magnificent painted hallway- 
MARGARET sweeping away from a dining room, regal in evening dress. 
INTERCUT - 
PARIS - A news journalist makes his report. 
NEWS JOURNALIST There's a general feeling that Mrs Thatcher is going to win on the first ballot. We're going to put it to bed tomorrow night, is how one of her campaign staff puts it. 
INT. GRAND HALL. PARIS. NIGHT 
MARGARET walks through a grand hall with her fellow PRESIDENTS and PRIME MINSTERS of the world, a lone woman amongst a sea of men. 
DENIS ON PHONE M, I really think you should come home and defend yourself old girl. Heseltine is campaigning ferociously. 
MARGARET ON PHONE OOV I do think my time is best spent seeing an end to the Cold War, don't you? After all this time they know what I stand for. 
PARIS - 
TREVOR MACDONALD Will she, or will she not, be in the job tomorrow? 
A GRAND HALL - a formal dinner, MARGARET flanked by bow- tied Prime Ministers and Heads of State. 
HEAD OF STATE 1 Margaret, they can't touch you. 
LONDON STREETS - CABINET MINISTERS walking along trying to hide their features from prying eyes. 
NEWS READER (O.S.) Mrs Thatcher has failed to win enough votes to secure an outright win in the leadership contest and must now decide whether to put her name forward for the second round. 
NEWS READER 2 As Mrs Thatcher leaves Paris for London to make a last ditch attempt to pull together support for her leadership, the ship may have sailed. 
INT.DINING ROOM.CHESTER SQUARE.PRESENT. 
MARGARET sips a whisky. 
MARGARET (V.O.) I offer my resignation after eleven and a half extraordinary years - 
INT. CORRIDOR. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1990. DAY. 
MARGARET descends the stairs like an operatic heroine, her hand gripping the banister of the staircase. Below the Downing St staff waiting to say goodbye. Many are in tears. 
MARGARET -proud to have left Britain in a much better state than when we took office. 
She passes the photographs of her predecessors and stops to receive a gift, opening it- 
MARGARET (CONT'D) What's this then? A radio... How useful. 
She moves down the receiving line of staff. The floor is carpeted with roses. Men's wet eyes. The door ahead. She is crying. 
Finally reaching the door, MARGARET stands bracing herself. Denis's hand on her shoulder standing behind. 
DENIS Steady, MT. 
MARGARET nods, bracing herself. A hand on the door handle. As it swings open- 
INT. BEDROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. NIGHT 
MARGARET stands staring at herself in the mirror. 
DENIS (O.S.) The greatest Prime Minister since Churchill deposed by a bunch of spineless pygmies! 
MARGARET VO All those years of taking the tough decisions, does any of it matter now? 
DENIS It's all been turned to mush! 
MARGARET What? 
DENIS lies on the bed behind her with the newspaper. 
DENIS By these fools! These lily-livered pinkos! 
MARGARET These inept placators. 
DENIS Very good! These vacillators. 
MARGARET Vacillators! Poll takers. 
DENIS Popularity seekers. 
MARGARET So busy taking the pulse of the public! 
DENIS Weak - 
MARGARET (pulling down a rack of Denis's black oxford shoes onto the floor) These...weak...weak...weak...wea.. .weak...Men! 
DENIS's clothes are all over the room and the main cupboard is open and empty apart from shoes. There are several bin liners already filled with clothes. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) Don't they know if you take the tough decisions, yes people will hate you today but they'll thank you for generations. 
DENIS Or forget you entirely and chuck you out with the rubbish! 
MARGARET turns away from this thought and opens a last big chest of drawers. 
MARGARET V/O (seizing shirts and jerseys and putting them on the floor) All I wanted was to make a difference in the world.

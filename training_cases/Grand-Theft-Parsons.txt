OPENING TITLE. 
"ALTHOUGH THIS MOTION PICTURE IS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY, CERTAIN CHARACTERS AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL." 
FADE IN: 
SUPER: 'SEPTEMBER 1973'. 
INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 
A phone rings in the dark. A little light falls from the open window, illuminating an old bakelite telephone. It sits on a small table alongside a large amount of empty bottles and a couple of overflowing ashtrays. EXT. PHIL'S TRIKE. NIGHT 
A three wheeled motorcycle is being driven through the night at great speed. The trike is moving very quickly, its headlights cutting through the darkness, its wheels sending a spray of sand flying towards us, as the driver fights to keep it on the road. This is PHIL KAUFMAN, and he's in a hurry. 
INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT 
Two figures are struggling on the floor. The male is naked. The woman sits astride him, her movements urgent, her breath fast. They appear to be having sex. 
EXT. TRIKE. DAWN 
The Trike cuts through the night, and we pull back to show desert, more desert, and then... a giant bright, flickering neon sign: 'Welcome to the Joshua Tree Inn'. 
INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 
That phone - still ringing; shrill, insistent. There is a bed next to the table. It is covered in clothes, but there is also a man's shape, which now moves. 
INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT 
A little more light, and it now appears as if our man and woman are struggling. There is fear on her face. 
INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 
Still that insistent ringing, and the covers suddenly fly off the bed. We see the man from behind as he shakes the sleep away and looks for the damn phone. 
INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT 
The woman is screaming now, and banging on the man's chest with her fists. He is motionless underneath her. 
EXT. OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE INN. DAWN 
The Trike skids to a halt amid a cloud of dust and the driver leaps off. He runs at the door, throwing it open in one movement, disappearing into the room. A broken striped 'No Entry - Police' band flutters to the ground. 
INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 
The man finally answers the phone.   At last the ringing stops. PHIL Hello? 
EXT. OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT 
The door bounces back open, and we can see the Phil walking quickly through the room. 
As he searches, we hear: 
WOMAN'S VOICE Oh my God please help me! I found your number in his pocket and I don't know... I don't know what to do. 
PHIL'S VOICE Ah, what... who are you? WOMAN'S VOICE He's dead... he's dead... and I'm... just... I don't know what to do. 
The man glances into the bathroom and opens some drawers. 
PHIL'S VOICE Hold on.   Tell me who's dead. 
WOMAN'S VOICE Parsons. Gram Parsons. We met in a bar and we had a lot to drink and he just... 
PHIL'S VOICE Are you sure he's dead? 
He looks under the beds. 
CON TINUE D: 
WOMAN'S VOICE Yeah. He's really dead.    He just... 
Phil wheels the gurney down the corridor towards the exit. A doctor in green scrubs approaches and glances down at a clipboard. 
DOCTOR Can I help you? 
PHIL Naw, I'm cool thanks. 
The doctor reads the tag on the body's toe. 
DOCTOR What are you doing? 
PHIL Just taking some stiff down to neurology. 
CON TINUE D: 
DOCTOR We don't have a neurology department. 
PHIL Urology. 
The doctor grabs the end of the gurney. Phil tugs and the doctor tugs back. After a moment, Phil sighs and shakes his head in frustration. 
PHIL (CONT'D) Okay. Just hold your horses - I'll go check the paperwork. 
The doctor holds up his clipboard. DOCTOR I have the paperwork. 
PHIL No. You have your paperwork. I need to go check my paperwork. 
He slips through the exit. The doctor waits awkwardly     for a few seconds, and then pushes open the door. 
DOCTOR Hello?   Hello... 
He glances around in surprise, but there is no-one in sight. 
EXT. DESERT. MORNING Phil's trike accelerates as it approaches a T junction.      To the right the sign points to 'Joshua Tree Town', to the left 'Los Angeles'. The trike doesn't even slow as it skids left, sending a spray of sand and gravel flying across the road. 
NB. There will be several shots of Phil driving through the desert, set to music. 
EXT. PHIL'S STREET. DAY 
The Trike pulls up outside a rambling old house. Two enormous plaster eagles flank the front door, a giant Harley Davidson sign hangs from the roof, and there's a six foot flashing neon star in the front window. Phil gets out, walks up to the door and pulls some keys out of his pocket. 
INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY 
Phil walks into the room and pours himself a drink. He slumps onto the couch, takes a sip and closes his eyes. We see movement behind him, as an attractive girl slips through a door and approaches Phil from behind. This is SUSIE, and she puts her hands over his eyes. 
SUSIE Guess who? 
PHIL Martin Luther King. 
SUSIE Try again... Susie leans over the back of the chair and gives Phil a long slow kiss. She jumps over the couch and resumes kissing, this time more passionately. Phil tries to pull away with little success. 
PHIL This.... ...isn't.... ...the best time... ...Baby.... 
Susie continues regardless, Phil is now finding it hard to resist. He eventually gives in, and they begin to kiss passionately. 
INT. PHIL'S KITCHEN. DAY 
Phil and Susie are sitting at the kitchen table.   He takes a drag from her cigarette and passes it back. SUSIE God damn!     I'm so sorry, baby. 
PHIL Yeah, out of a job again. 
SUSIE Would never have happened if you were there. 
PHIL How do you know I wasn't? 
SUSIE Well, if you were, you wouldn't have let him die. 
PHIL I was still 'on staff'. He was still my responsibility. 
CON TINUE D: 
They sit quietly for a moment.      Then: 
PHIL (CONT'D) So where have you been, anyway? 
She sighs, and stands up. 
PHIL (CONT'D) How long this time? Two weeks? 
SUSIE Your job is to arrange other people's lives. Maybe it's time to put a little thought into your own. 
Susie walks out of the room. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET. DAY 
A suburban street of small, neat bungalows. We move down the street, past house and identical house, until we rest outside another that is identical to the rest. The front door opens, and a nondescript man emerges, carrying a small overnight bag. He carefully locks the door and walks down the path to where a cab waits. We can clearly see 'New Orleans Taxi' marked on the door. 
MAN Airport, please. 
This is STANLEY PARSONS, Gram's father. 
INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY 
There is a loud banging on the front door. Phil glances out of the window, and looks momentarily puzzled. He opens the door, and a beautiful woman stands on the step. 
PHIL Long time, no see, Barbara. 
CON TINUE D: 
BARBARA Don't try and schmooze me, Kaufman, you repellent slimeball. 
She notices Susie standing behind Phil. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) The latest victim? 
Barbara walks past them into the kitchen.      Susie looks quizzically at Phil. 
PHIL Meet Barbara. 
Barbara calls out from the kitchen. BARBARA It's a lot tidier than I remember. 
Susie raises an eyebrow at Phil. 
SUSIE Who the hell is she? 
PHIL Gram's ex-girlfriend. 
Phil points at his temple as if to say she's nuts. 
SUSIE Girlfriend? Isn't he married? 
Barbara walks back into the hall. BARBARA Welcome to the seventies. 
PHIL What do you want, Barbara? 
Barbara lights a cigarette. 
BARBARA I'm here to fulfill Gram's wishes. 
She waits for him to speak. 
PHIL That's nice. I have no idea what you're talking about. 
She holds up an old piece of writing paper. 
CON TINUE D: (2) 
BARBARA Do you know what this is? 
Phil reaches for it, but Barbara snatches it away. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) It's Gram's will. 
She reads it out. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) To whom it may concern: I would like it to be known that it is my wish to leave Barbara Mansfield my assets and belongings in the event of my death. Signed: Ingram Cecil Parsons. 
Phil looks surprised. 
PHIL Did he write that with joined up writing or was it before he knew how? 
Barbara gives a wry smile. 
BARBARA Still the jester Kaufman, and still very unfunny. 
PHIL That's not a will Barbara, and you know it. BARBARA It's better than a will, actually. It's a signed promise from Gram to leave me all his assets and belongings. And anyway, it's really none of your business what this is. I've come for the guitar. 
UNDERTAKER (CONT'D) Yeah, he was here. 
Mutter. 
UNDERTAKER (CONT'D) New Orleans. Although he only just went, so he'll still be on his way to Los Angeles Airport. Big thrill for us here, as we're only a small facility. Nearly got Jane Mansfield in '67 when she passed through, but she got diverted to Frisco. Hello? 
No mutter. 
UNDERTAKER (CONT'D) Hello.    Hellooo... 
INT. PHIL'S KITCHEN. DAY 
The phone sits on the table but the room is empty. 
SUSIE (O.S) Phil? 
Susie walks in, looks around, and leaves. 
EXT. PHIL'S DRIVEWAY. DAY Phil is lying down in the back of Susie's station wagon, his feet sticking out of the back. Susie comes out of the house carrying the guitar, and sits on the steps, where she watches him. After a minute: 
SUSIE What are you doing? 
PHIL These things aren't that big. 
SUSIE Okay.    Is that a problem? 
PHIL Not really. 
Susie is confused. 
CON TINUE D: 
SUSIE Well, that's good. 
No answer.      Phil continues to check out the inside of her car. 
SUSIE (CONT'D) So what are you up to? 
PHIL It's best you don't know. 
Without a word, Susie gets up and walks into the house. Phil lies still. After a moment, she reappears with her bag. She flounces theatrically past him and opens the car door. Phil gets out of the back. SUSIE I don't know what this madness is, but I'm not getting involved. 
PHIL Well, that's the point. 
SUSIE I mean, I don't know what it is you're planning, but I'm not bailing you out again. 
PHIL Right. 
SUSIE I'm going. PHIL Again. 
She gets into the car and slams the door. She starts the engine, and Phil stands back, but the car doesn't move. After a moment the window winds down. 
SUSIE This time, I'm not coming back. 
She gives him a 'so there' smile. 
SUSIE (CONT'D) I'm going to find a man who buys his ties in bulk. 
She drives away. 
EXT. LARRY OSTERBERG'S HOME. DAY 
Phil arrives on his trike outside a small house. 
INT. LARRY OSTERBERG'S HOME. DAY 
A man is sitting cross-legged on the floor. A joss stick burns beside him, and sitar music plays in the background. This is LARRY OSTERBERG, and he is meditating. There is a loud hammering on the door. Larry shows no sign of having heard anything. More hammering at the door, but still no response. Then the letter box creaks open and an eye appears in the slot. After a moment, the eye disappears and Phil's face appears momentarily at the window. The window seems to be slightly higher than Phil, so his face appears every time he jumps up to peer into the room. 
PHIL (O.S) Hello? Anyone there? Then Phil is gone. Larry expels a big breath. The letterbox creaks opens again and the eye is back. 
PHIL (CONT'D) (O.S) There you are. I'm looking for Larry Osterberg. 
Larry sighs, and stretches. He gets up slowly, gently shakes himself to relax his muscles and walks to the door, which he opens. 
LARRY The door is unlocked. 
Phil barrels in and closes the door behind him.   He turns to take a look around the room. PHIL You Larry Osterberg? 
LARRY Meet Bernice. 
PHIL Bernice? 
LARRY Bernice is a Cadillac Superior Royale Tiara Limousine Funeral Coach. We've got a Seven gallon V8 engine offering three hundred and forty bhp at four thousand six hundred revolutions per minute. You're looking at a twenty one feet beauty with a one hundred and fifty six inch wheelbase containing a four barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor with Turbo Hydramatic transmission. Bernice weighs over six thousand pounds. 
There is a very long silence. 
PHIL It's yellow. 
LARRY Yes, it's yellow.    Bernice comes in yellow. 
PHIL It's supposed to be black. 
LARRY But they're all black. 
CON TINUE D: 
PHIL That might be my point. 
LARRY So how is a yellow hearse covered with flowers less of a surprise than a black hearse? 
PHIL I paid you two hundred dollars for a black hearse. 
LARRY (patiently) No, you paid me a hundred and eighty dollars for a hearse, and a hearse is what you've got. If you take a long, hard look at Bernice, you'll see that she's one of a kind. She's big, she's fast, she's comfortable, and she's beautiful. But she's not black. 
They stare at each other for a moment.       Then Phil sighs deeply. 
PHIL Okay.   Where are the keys? 
LARRY Why? 
PHIL I gotta go. Larry looks from Phil to Bernice and back again. 
LARRY Oh, no. She doesn't go anywhere without me. 
Phil thinks this over. 
PHIL Okay.   Well, let's boogie. 
Larry runs across and closes the doors on a pile of amps and band equipment that now sits in the garage. Phil puts the guitar in the back seat and they get into the car. 
INT. HEARSE. DAY 
Larry pulls a screwdriver out of the glove compartment and jigs it about in the ignition until the engine catches. 
CON TINUE D: Then he turns the keys and pull up and down to undo the steering lock. Phil watches curiously. 
LARRY Someone stole her last summer. 
PHIL Well, I've paid top dollar, so it's nice to see I'm getting the best... 
LARRY How did you hear of Bernice and me? 
PHIL You are famous throughout the greater Los Angeles area. 
Larry looks pleased. 
PHIL (CONT'D) But you are the only guy with a hearse. Don't go getting carried away... 
EXT. LA HIGHWAY. DAY 
One backfire, and Bernice is ready. The hearse weaves erratically across the road and then disappears in a cloud of exhaust smoke. 
INT. BARBARA'S HOME. EVENING 
Barbara sits at a table in her shabby kitchen, reading the will. She lights a cigarette and sits back in her chair. EXT. LAX. EVENING 
The hearse drives under a huge sign which reads 'Welcome to Los Angeles Airport' and peels off the main road past some offices and cargo stores. Bernice drives into a giant hangar and pulls up outside a dark and shuttered office. 
INT. HEARSE - OUTSIDE MORTUARY. EVENING 
Phil glances out of the window. 
PHIL Pull over. 
Larry parks, and Phil looks at his watch. 
Stanley is obviously having problems fully understanding what is being said. After a moment: 
STANLEY Stanley Parsons. P. J. GAMBRELL Gowna be a trip. Besta know yer otherwise gowna be a slow one. 
STANLEY Yes.   I suppose so. 
INT. MORTUARY. MORNING 
The clerk scribbles on a form. 
CLERK Papers? 
PHIL They'll be along. With this being a rush job, they said you'd understand. He passes a folded banknote across.      The clerk pockets it without a change of expression. 
CLERK Well, you'd better tell them that we've got rules. 
The men stare at each other. Then Phil pulls another note out of his pocket and passes that over. Again, the clerk pockets it. 
CLERK (CONT'D) And this is the exception which proves that particular rule. 
A beat.   Then: 
CLERK (CONT'D) Although you don't need to tell them that. 
CON TINUE D: 
Phil smiles broadly at him. The clerk turns and selects a casket from a gurney behind the counter. 
CLERK (CONT'D) And this... is your deceased. 
INT. MORTUARY. MORNING 
Phil is wheeling a casket on a gurney down the middle of the hangar. He can see Larry peering through the window at him. He can also see a uniformed policeman approaching Larry from the other side of the street. As he speeds up to try and reach Larry first, the clerk calls out from his desk. 
CLERK Good luck with her. 
Phil closes his eyes and slows to a halt. 
EXT. OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING 
Larry is jumping up and down nervously outside the window. The policeman appears at his shoulder. 
COP Excuse me, sir.    Is that your hearse? 
Larry turns slowly. 
LARRY Hearse? 
The cop points at Bernice. COP That hearse. 
Larry has started to sweat profusely. 
LARRY That hearse? 
The cop looks at him carefully. 
COP Are you okay, sir? 
LARRY Okay?   Sure... 
He leans against the window for support. 
INT. PLANE - LAX. MORNING 
Stanley is looking out of the plane's window, but the fat man is now locked on. He gestures around him. 
PJ GAMBRELL Jes sayin' 'bout the space. 
Another thoughtful pause from Stanley. 
STANLEY Yes. 
He glances out at the cargo loaders. 
PJ GAMBRELL Space ma game, kinda. Partitions. Fixed. Slidin'. Demountable. Integrated. 
STANLEY Right. 
Phil is under pressure. 
PHIL Joshua Tree, yeah. 
A buzzer sounds.         No-one moves. 
PHIL (CONT'D) Joshua Tree, Louisiana. Just outside the city. 
CLERK Never heard of that. 
CON TINUE D: 
PHIL It's small. Just another local community struggling to get by. 
The buzzer goes again, and Phil attempts to change the subject. 
PHIL (CONT'D) Use your phone? 
After a moment, the clerk nods towards the phone on the desk, before turning and disappearing into the rear of the mortuary. Phil wipes some sweat from his forehead, picks up the phone and dials. 
INT. PHIL'S LOUNGE. MORNING Susie is packing. The phone rings and she hesitates for a moment. Then she continues loading her case, leaving the phone unanswered. 
INT. CHECK IN DESK. DAY 
Stanley tries to ask a question at the check in desk, but gives up and walks toward an exit. 
INT. MORTUARY. MORNING 
The clerk returns with a casket on a gurney and Phil replaces the receiver as the clerk flips open the top of the casket and peers inside. 
CLERK (into casket) Hello there. We was looking for you. 
He wheels the casket over and Phil has a quick look inside. 
CLERK (CONT'D) Need you to sign for it again. 
Phil signs the papers. 
CLERK (CONT'D) Looks like it's your lucky day after all. 
PHIL Yeah.   I'm a real lucky guy. 
Phil again glances out of the window. 
EXT. OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING 
The cop is wandering around the hearse.    Larry trails behind him, disconsolately. 
COP I don't like the look of you. 
LARRY (miserably) No. Fair enough. 
COP Wherever there's a hippie there's a crime, even if it hasn't happened yet. That's what I always say. 
LARRY Right.   Good saying. 
He prods at the broken light with his baton. 
COP So whatcha doing here? 
LARRY We're meeting someone off a flight. 
COP You're meeting someone off a flight? 
LARRY Yes. 
COP In a hearse? 
LARRY Yes.   It's a... surprise. 
COP Which parts the surprise: The fact that you're in a bright yellow hearse, the fact that you're dressed like something out of a horror film, or the fact that you're half a mile from the terminal and they're gonna have to walk across two runways to reach you? 
Larry is looking increasingly desperate. 
CON TINUE D: 
LARRY Well... the first part. 
PHIL Yes!    We did it!! 
LARRY Did what?    What did we do? 
Phil changes the subject. 
PHIL What was all that babbling about earlier? 
LARRY I didn't babble. I just... have a problem with authority. 
CON TINUE D: 
PHIL What the hell does that mean? 
LARRY I don't like them and I don't know what to say to them. They make me feel uneasy. 
PHIL Well of course they make you feel uneasy. They're supposed to make you feel uneasy. 
Larry sulks. Phil shakes his head and glances back at the cop and Larry crashes the car straight into the hangar wall. EXT. OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING 
We pull back to reveal the enormous opening that Larry has missed. 
INT. HEARSE - OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING 
They both sit there, staring out of the windshield at the wall. 
PHIL You hit the wall. 
LARRY I clipped it. I clipped the wall. 
PHIL (shouts) There's a gap fifty yards wide! You just had to aim for the gap. How could you miss the gap? 
LARRY (babbles) I was distracted. We're supposed to be picking someone up and you arrive with a coffin and I'd only just woken up and... 
The cop peers in at the window and gestures at Phil to wind it down. As he does, the glass falls out. 
PHIL Hello, officer. I guess they make these hearses wider than they need to... 
The cop ignores him and concentrates on Larry. 
CON TINUE D: 
COP Are you on drugs, boy? 
Larry swallows hard. 
LARRY Uh, not at this time, no sir. 
COP Not at this time. Okay, well let's see. You just missed a gap of fifty yards and hit a wall in broad daylight. Why was that? 
Larry licks his lips. LARRY Well... 
Pause.   Phil wills him to speak. 
PHIL Well... 
Still nothing. Larry looks like he's trying to form words, but nothing emerges. 
COP Now I'm gonna... 
The radio in his car crackles into life. We - and he - are too far away to hear what is said. He is torn for a moment, but then: 
COP (CONT'D) Wait. 
He walks back to his car.           Phil shakes his head. 
PHIL Fantastic.     Well done. 
LARRY Oh, right.     So it's all my fault? 
PHIL You... you just drove into a wall! Of course it's your fault. Jesus! 
They both stare out of the window at the cop, who is talking animatedly into his radio. Then the flashing lights and siren go on. 
PHIL (CONT'D) Here it comes... 
CON TINUE D: (2) 
Larry turns to look at his reflection in the grimy mirror. He is shaking. 
EXT. GAS STATION FORECOURT. DAY 
The tank is full, and the attendant screws the cap back on. Phil reaches into the back and pulls out his jerry can. He passes it to the guy. 
PHIL High test. 
ATTENDANT This car runs on regular. 
Phil raises an eyebrow, glances across at the casket, and winks. PHIL Who says it's for the car? 
The man gapes at him. Larry walks over to the car and Phil gets into the passenger seat. He passes some money to the attendant and takes the can. 
ATTENDANT Ain't fer the car? 
PHIL Nope. 
Larry jiggles the screwdriver, slips Bernice into gear, and they're gone. The attendant watches them go. 
INT. HEARSE. DAY 
Larry is driving, Phil is looking out of the window.   They are still in a built up area with cars around them. 
CON TINUE D: 
LARRY We could go back. 
PHIL Why would we want to do that? 
LARRY I wasn't expecting a long trip. I haven't packed any spare clothes. We could pick up some supplies and drive out tomorrow. 
PHIL You want to go home to pick up fresh clothes? LARRY Well, yes. 
Phil stares at him. 
PHIL And then drive back out tomorrow? 
LARRY We could do that. 
PHIL Just drive the car, okay? 
LARRY We could just... 
PHIL No. LARRY It would... 
PHIL No. 
LARRY I... 
PHIL No. 
INT. BARBARA'S HOME. DAY 
Barbara is standing in her sitting room, the phone to her ear. 
BARBARA You might need to repeat that. 
CON TINUE D: 
Her mouth drops open and she sinks down onto her couch. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) Stolen? What the hell do you mean, stolen? Who steals a body? 
INT. HEARSE. DAY 
Phil is smoking. Larry is driving, his fingers tapping nervously on the wheel. He looks distracted and speaks to break the silence. 
LARRY I still don't fully understand what you do. PHIL Well, I do everything. 
LARRY Everything? 
PHIL This little number is for drinking money. By trade I'm a Road Manager. 
LARRY Oh, one of those.   Like a well- paid gopher. 
PHIL No, not like a well-paid gopher. I'm responsible for movement, maintenance and management. I'm a confidante and a companion, a partner and a patron, an ally, agent and ambassador. I'm like an executive nanny. Not a gopher. 
BARBARA Fine. 
She walks across the room and picks up the phone. 
EXT. MELON STALL. DAY 
Phil is holding the phone. 
PHIL Hello baby, it's the love machine. How are ya? 
INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY 
Barbara smiles unpleasantly. BARBARA Hello Kaufman. I know what you're up to, you thieving bastard. I know where you're going, and I know about your sick, revolting plans, and I'm coming after you. And when I catch you... 
EXT. MELON STALL. DAY 
Phil looks surprised. 
PHIL Hello Barbara. How nice to hear from you again. And so soon... 
Suddenly the door of the hearse flies open and Larry runs out. Phil holds the phone away from his ear as Barbara's shouting can be heard coming out of the receiver. He watches as Larry just makes it to a cactus and is violently sick. He glances across to where the old melon woman watches, expressionless, from her stall. After a moment, Larry wipes himself down and walks back to the car. 
PHIL (CONT'D) Sorry Barb, gotta go. 
He goes to replace the receiver, and then pops in a last comment. 
PHIL (CONT'D) It's been real, though. 
He puts the phone down, cutting off Barbara's squawk and watches Larry get into the hearse. He frowns. 
INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY 
Barbara slams the phone down. Then she picks up the receiver again and smashes it onto the table. 
BARBARA Sonofabitch! 
She walks to the door, brushing past Susie.   Then she stops. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) Okay, honey. Do you want to see who Phil Kaufman really is? Do you want to see what he's capable of? Barbara shows Susie the door. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) Or maybe you already know I'm right. 
Susie hesitantly dismisses the challenge. 
SUSIE You don't know shit about him. 
BARBARA Well why don't we find out? 
Barbara turns and walks out.    Susie looks at her packed bags then follows. 
INT. HEARSE. DAY Phil gets into the hearse, looks back at the coffin and sniffs. He looks down at the air conditioning and turns it up full. Larry starts the engine and the car stalls. 
PHIL So what's that about? 
LARRY Sunstroke. 
Phil shakes his head. 
PHIL You've hardly left the car since we met. How can you have sunstroke? 
LARRY I'm susceptible. 
CON TINUE D: 
Phil doesn't look convinced. 
PHIL You're a winner, that's what you are. A winner... 
Eventually, the engine catches. Phil immediately gestures at a small road that heads off into the desert. 
PHIL (CONT'D) Turn off here. 
LARRY This isn't the way to Palm Springs. Phil winks at him. 
PHIL It is if you're a coffin smuggler. 
EXT. HIGHWAY. DAY 
CON TINUE D: 
There is a faint noise. Larry hears it first and then Phil and then, as they strain to identify it, they see a tiny dot on the road ahead of them, which grows and grows as they watch it, and they peer hard into the wind to identify it and... it's a motorcycle cop. 
PHIL (CONT'D) I don't believe it. Middle of nowhere, and... quick - stand in front of the car! 
EXT. HIGHWAY. DAY 
They jump out of the car and shuffle sideways, until they are standing in front of the actual point of collision. LARRY What now? 
PHIL Pretend we're having a conversation. 
The buckled sign hangs dangerously above them as they both grin at the approaching policeman in a friendly manner. 
LARRY Okay.   What about? 
PHIL I don't know what about! Ever since I met you, you've talked. Yabba, yabba, yabba, every waking minute. Religion, your supersonic, supercharged car, the darkside. Now you need to talk, and you can't think of anything to say. 
The cop slows down but drives past.        Phil waves at him. 
PHIL (CONT'D) Whatever your damn fool religion is called, I think it works. 
LARRY Well... it's more a philosophy than a religion. 
The cop does a U-turn and motors towards them. 
PHIL Oh, well done. Good work. 
He shoots a vicious look at Larry.      The cop parks his bike and removes his helmet. 
CON TINUE D: As he opens his mouth to speak, a headlight falls off the car and rolls off the road. They all watch it go. 
MOTORCYCLE COP Afternoon. 
PHIL Afternoon, officer.    How's it going today? 
The sign gives an ominous creak.         Larry takes a sideways step, out of danger. 
MOTORCYCLE COP Oh, it's going fine, thank you. How are things with you? PHIL Fine, fine. We just... stopped to take a look at... 
He waves his arm at the desert. 
PHIL (CONT'D) ...the fine view you folks have got around here. 
The cop takes his sunglasses off and takes a look around, as if it's the first time he's seen it. 
MOTORCYCLE COP Well, it is mighty nice around these parts. If you like desert. 
They all look appreciatively at the desert, and the cop glances down at the keys in Larry's hand. MOTORCYCLE COP (CONT'D) (to Larry) And how are things with you today, sir? 
Larry looks flustered. 
LARRY Ooooh, I'm well. Really well, actually. Thank you. 
The cop doesn't respond, just keeps looking at Larry with a pleasant half-smile on his face. 
MOTORCYCLE COP The reason I ask, is that you appear to have driven into one of our road signs. 
CON TINUE D: (2) 
Larry turns and appears to see the huge buckled pole for the first time. 
LARRY Oh. 
MOTORCYCLE COP I'm surprised that you hadn't noticed earlier, as it does appear to be impeding your forward progress. 
Phil starts to laugh. 
PHIL That's a great line... The cop turns to Phil.        He is still smiling. 
MOTORCYCLE COP Thank you. 
A long pause.      Then: 
MOTORCYCLE COP (CONT'D) I wonder if you gentlemen can help me? 
PHIL Anything. 
PHIL Yes, I think we should go. 
Larry starts the car. He throws it into reverse and the bumper slowly disengages from the metal signpost. Suddenly the car tears loose and flies backwards, smashing into the cop's motorcycle, leaving him holding the radio and its trailing wire. Larry slams on the brakes. 
LARRY Oh shit. 
PHIL Nicely done. 
He rolls down his window and addresses the cop, who is staring with horror at his ruined motorcycle. 
PHIL (CONT'D) We'll be moving on, now that your sign no longer appears to be impeding our forward progress. 
Bernice accelerates away but slowly starts to turn in a wide ark and circles the smashed bike. The cop chases them. 
INT. HEARSE. DAY 
Phil screams at Larry. 
PHIL What the hell are you doing? 
CON TINUE D: 
LARRY The steering lock is on. 
PHIL Well...   turn it off! 
LARRY I can't - he's got the keys. 
Phil turns to watch the chasing policeman. 
PHIL So, we've escaped but we can only drive in a circle? 
LARRY Yes. 
EXT. DESERT. DAY 
They do another circuit. The exhausted cop stops, breathing heavily, and then watches in astonishment as the hearse turns and heads back towards him. 
INT. HEARSE. DAY 
Phil and Larry stare at the policeman out of the window as the car sweeps past. The cop gets his gun out of his holster, and Phil reaches into the glove box and pulls out the screwdriver. He leans across Larry, jams it into the wheel column, and snaps the steering lock in two. The hearse's direction immediately changes. 
PHIL Can we please go? LARRY Okay. 
EXT. DESERT. DAY 
The hearse roars away and the cop watches it go. 
INT. BARBARA'S CAR. DAY 
Barbara drives and Susie sits in the passenger seat.   It doesn't look as if they've spoken for hours. 
SUSIE If you hate Phil so much, why are you chasing him across California? 
BARBARA He's got Gram and I need him. 
CON TINUE D: 
SUSIE Well, that's really touching. But... you've got to come to terms with the fact that he's dead. 
Barbara shoots her a withering look. 
BARBARA I know he's dead, Honey. But he hasn't been officially identified, and there's no certificate of death. 
SUSIE I don't understand. BARBARA Let's just say I'm overly sentimental, okay? 
SUSIE This is all about money, isn't it? 
BARBARA Isn't everything? 
SUSIE Why do you think you deserve anything? 
BARBARA I was a great support to Gram before Kaufman came along and spoiled the party. 
SUSIE Phil's not responsible for your problems with Gram. 
BARBARA What do you know? 
Phil propels Larry outside. 
CON TINUE D: 
LARRY Gram Parsons? Is Gram Parsons dead? 
PHIL Better get going. 
LARRY He said someone took Gram Parson's body. Two people... 
PHIL Yeah, he was a real blabbermouth. In fact, I thought he was never gonna stop talking. Anyway, although that's real interesting, we've gotta keep to the schedule. 
LARRY Schedule? What schedule?   There is no schedule... 
PHIL Well, I think we should just make our delivery as soon as possible, don't you? Get our package to Palm Springs. Remember? 
Larry looks horrified. 
LARRY Package?   We've stolen that man's son. 
PHIL Stolen... his son? That's outrageous! I'm appalled that you could even think we'd do such a thing. 
They move round the back of the Polyonax Place, where Bernice is hidden behind an outhouse. 
LARRY I don't know what you take me for. I want to see in that box. 
Larry walks round to the back of the car. 
PHIL We've really got to go. 
Larry swings open the back window and pulls at the casket. 
LARRY It's heavy. 
CON TINUE D: (2) 
Phil glances at his watch. 
PHIL Okay, then. Well, if you're satisfied, let's go. 
LARRY I said it's heavy. 
PHIL Heavy, yes. Well, it is made of wood. Wood is heavy. Actually. 
LARRY Yeah, I remember.    Finest poplar. Larry slides the top of the casket off and looks inside. He recoils. 
LARRY (CONT'D) Jesusjesusjesus... 
He drops the lid and looks at Phil, horrified.   Phil walks over and looks inside. 
PHIL Gosh, they must have given us a full one. We'll have to sort that all out when we get to Palm Springs and... 
Larry is staring at him with horror. 
LARRY Oh my God.     You stole Gram Parsons. 
Phil gives up. 
PHIL Well, technically, we stole Gram Parsons. 
LARRY I stole a coffin, I didn't know there was a body in it. 
PHIL I'd save that line for court. 
As the enormity of the news starts to sink in, Larry hops up and down in panic. Phil watches him. 
PHIL (CONT'D) What are you doing now? 
CON TINUE D: (3) 
Larry is losing control. 
LARRY I don't know! What am I doing? I mean... What-am-I-doing? Why am I here? Why am I with you? WHAT IS GOING ON? 
PHIL Calm down. 
LARRY I thought it was bad enough when I ran over the cop's bike, but now I'm a fucking body snatcher. PHIL Well, when you've quite finished, we should go. 
PHIL Do you have friends? 
LARRY Of course I have friends. 
PHIL Well, what would you do for them? 
LARRY Anything, within reason. 
Phil stares out of the window. PHIL That's what I hate about people like you. Everything's 'within reason'. There are always boundaries, provisos. You only operate with a safety net. 
Larry is confused. 
LARRY Tell me something - if it was the other way round, would Gram be sitting here, driving your bones out into the desert? 
Phil says nothing. 
LARRY (CONT'D) Well? PHIL You've missed the point. See, it doesn't matter what he would do, or what you and your tie-dyed friends think is the correct way to behave. To me, it only matters what I do. Where you have boundaries and limits and thresholds - I only have right and wrong. If I make a promise, I keep it - that's right. If I break that promise - that's wrong. 
Phil rubs his eyes, tired. Suddenly, Larry smashes Phil across the head with a bottle of Jack Daniels. Phil slumps back in the seat and Larry, dropping the bloodied weapon, reaches across to grab the wheel and slow the hearse. 
EXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT 
Bernice fishtails across the road as Larry struggles to retain control. It eventually slides to a halt. Larry gets out and runs round to the drivers' door. 
INT. HEARSE. NIGHT 
Larry stares down at Phil. 
LARRY Ohmygod. 
He slides Phil across the seat and slips behind the wheel. He shouts at the unconscious Phil. LARRY (CONT'D) You made me do it, you bastard! I've never hit anyone in my life, but you pushed and you pushed and... you gave me no choice. 
Larry prods Phil to ensure he's unresponsive. 
EXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT 
The hearse executes a wide U-turn before gently rejoining the highway and heading back towards town. A moment after completing the turn, the one remaining headlight stutters and goes out. Bernice pulls off the road. 
INT. HEARSE. NIGHT 
LARRY Shit. He flicks the headlight switch, but to no avail. Then, in the distance, he sees a car approaching. Stanley can be glimpsed in the driving seat as the car flashes past. 
LARRY (CONT'D) Shit.   Shitshitshit. 
EXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT 
Bernice rejoins the road and drives slowly off into the darkness after Stanley. 
INT. HEARSE. NIGHT 
Phil is motionless, and Larry peers out into the darkness as the car limps on, lit only from the light of the moon. Larry sees a glow in the distance ahead, and drives towards a neon sign; 'Welcome to the Joshua Tree Inn'. 
CON TINUE D: He stops by the entrance to the inn and stares at Stanley's car parked in the bay outside room 8. He glances across at Phil, turns the car around and drives in. 
EXT. JOSHUA TREE INN. NIGHT 
Bernice glides to a stop in the bay next to Stanley's car. Larry gets out and looks around. After a moment, he walks over to the door of room eight and knocks. 
EXT. OUTSIDE ROOM 8 - JOSHUA TREE INN. NIGHT 
A tired-looking Stanley opens the door. 
STANLEY Yeah? LARRY Hi. 
STANLEY Hello. 
They stare at each other. 
LARRY Um. I'm one of the guys that took your son. 
After a moment, Stanley steps back and opens the door. 
STANLEY You'd better come in. 
EXT. HIGHWAY/CAR PARK - JOSHUA TREE INN. NIGHT A car drives past the inn and then brakes sharply and skids across the road. It reverses and pulls in, parking next to the hearse. Barbara and Susie get out and look around. Then Susie walks over to the hearse's passenger window and raps on the glass, and Barbara marches to the back of the hearse and attempts to open it. She can't. 
BARBARA Where's the catch on this piece of shit? 
STANLEY You know I can't let you do that? 
PHIL I know you have to. Stanley smashes the receiver down onto the table.   Everyone jumps. 
STANLEY I don't have to do anything, Mister Kaufman. This is MY loss! This was MY son! How dare you try to take my grief away from me. 
PHIL It's too late to claim him now. 
STANLEY What the hell does that mean? 
They are almost nose-to-nose now. 
PHIL It means that you were never there when it mattered to Gram. It means that you stopped being a father the moment he stopped doing your bidding. It means that you learned to care too late. That's what it means. 
STANLEY I don't have to justify my relationship with Gram to you. 
PHIL Not to me, no. 
Stanley sits down. 
STANLEY It's true that when Gram left college, we drifted apart. (MOR E) 
CON TINUE D: (2) STA NLEY (CONT'D) He was a disappointment to me, because he wouldn't use his brain. He had so much to offer, but he let it trickle away. 
PHIL No - he gave it his all, but in a way you could never understand. And all he ever wanted from you was approval. He wanted you to be proud of what he had achieved. 
STANLEY I kept everything. Every record, every article, every photo. 
PHIL It's no good telling me.   You should have told him. 
STANLEY I loved him. 
PHIL Too late... 
Stanley looks up at Phil. 
STANLEY I understand that you were his right-hand man, as well as his friend? 
PHIL I was both, yes. STANLEY And that you weren't there when he died? When he needed you most? 
A beat, then: 
PHIL Yes.    That's right. 
STANLEY So the guilt isn't all mine, then? 
PHIL I guess not. 
Susie walks over and takes Phil's hand. Stanley says nothing for a moment, but his eyes fill with tears. 
CON TINUE D: (3) 
STANLEY You boys took away my son. I lost him once in life, and now you're trying to take him from me again. 
He starts to cry. Larry shoots an imploring look at Phil. Barbara glances around the room. 
BARBARA Can we just cut through this? 
She gestures at Phil and Larry. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) You two stole the body. Theft. Indicates Susie. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) Sweetie, I'm sorry, but you seem to be in the whole thing up to your neck. Accessory. 
Waves a hand at Stanley. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) And you are an old fool who should have called the police, but hasn't. Stupidity. 
She walks over to the phone. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) Now, let's just call the cops and get it done. The sooner we get us a death certificate and bury him, the sooner his soul will be properly laid to rest. 
Phil walks over to Barbara, picks her up and carries her into the bathroom. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) Hey! What the hell are you doing? 
He emerges and slips the back of a chair under the handle, effectively locking the door. 
STANLEY You don't need... 
Larry holds his hand up to stop Stanley. 
LARRY I've taken heroin, speed, uppers, downers, blues, morphine, methadone, mushrooms, quaaludes, acid, valium, barbiturates, straight LSD, marijuana, marijuana laced with opium, nembutal, mescalin of course, and medical methaqualone, which made me shake uncontrollably for six weeks and vomit every hour. STANLEY (dryly) That's very impressive, son. 
LARRY Not my point. 
PHIL Better make the point. 
LARRY I started working my way through that list on June 5th 1969, and since then there hasn't been a day when I didn't at least smoke one joint. 
Phil shoots Larry a dangerous look. 
CON TINUE D: (2) 
PHIL Are we sure that this is helping? 
Larry ignores him. 
LARRY And now I've stopped. I stopped because it seems that I had something more important to do. 
They all look at him.   He gestures at Phil. 
LARRY (CONT'D) He's doing this because he gave his word. I'm prepared to do this now because I think it's right. And because I believe that each body has a soul. And Gram's soul doesn't belong in a family plot surrounded by strangers. It belongs here, where he was happiest. 
In the silence, Susie walks over and grips Phil's hand. Then Stanley gets up off the bed. 
STANLEY I'm going to go say goodbye to my son. 
Everyone looks surprised. Phil gives Larry a look of appreciative approval. Barbara starts to kick furiously at the door from inside the bathroom. Stanley pauses for a moment, and then walks outside. Phil and Larry watch him go, and Susie walks over to kiss Phil. PHIL What's that for? 
SUSIE That's for failing to reinforce my expectations. 
PHIL Well... I'll have to do that more often. 
The three of them move to the door, and Phil turns to Larry. 
PHIL (CONT'D) Did you really take all those drugs? 
LARRY Of course not. 
CON TINUE D: (3) 
He grins at Phil. 
LARRY (CONT'D) I may have got a little carried away... 
The door of the bathroom shakes and one of the hinges flies across the room. 
PHIL C'mon, time to go... 
EXT. OUTSIDE ROOM 8. NIGHT 
Phil, Larry and Susie leave room eight. They look around with surprise, but there is no sign of Stanley. Phil opens the back of the hearse and takes a quick peek inside the casket. 
PHIL Just checking. 
LARRY Yeah, he took the body and stuffed it in the trunk of his car before escaping into the night. 
Larry is already behind the wheel.   Phil opens the car door and looks at Susie. 
PHIL Are you coming? 
She smiles at him. SUSIE I reckon I am. 
She gets in. There is a final, almighty 'crash' from inside room eight. The three of them look at each other, and then Bernice is gone into the darkness. A moment later Barbara runs outside. She leaps into her car and screeches after them. In the distance a blue flashing police light suddenly materializes. 
INT. BARBARA'S CAR. NIGHT 
Barbara is on the road, driving fast. Suddenly a blue flashing police light fills her mirror. 
BARBARA Thank God! 
She pulls over and the police cruiser pulls in behind her. The traffic cop walks up and looks through the window. 
CON TINUE D: 
Phil stops pouring and shakes the can. 
PHIL Only a little left. 
He pours the rest of the can into the casket. Susie walks over to stand next to Phil. He looks down at Gram. 
PHIL (CONT'D) I'm sorry I wasn't there for you when it mattered, but I was there before, and I've been there ever since. Gram, good luck to you, wherever you are. 
They all stare at the casket. Phil wipes a tear away and tucks a can of beer into the coffin. 
CON TINUE D: (2) 
PHIL (CONT'D) That's my last one, man. 
He rests Gram's guitar against the casket, takes big puffs on his cigar to get the flame up, then tosses it into the coffin. They wait. Nothing happens. Phil edges nearer and looks inside. Then the coffin explodes into flames. All three of them are thrown backwards by the blast. 
EXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT 
The traffic cop is finishing the ticket when there is a ball of flame in the distance. Barbara just scowls. 
TRAFFIC COP Jesus!    What the hell's that? BARBARA That'll be Gram Parsons, on fire. 
TRAFFIC COP Get in the car, ma'am.   Now. 
EXT. DESERT. NIGHT 
Phil, Larry and Susie pick themselves up. They stare at the pyre. Phil is close to tears, and Susie puts her arm around him. For a moment, Phil thinks he sees the flames morph into the shape of an angel over the burning coffin. The image disappears when Larry speaks. 
LARRY Maybe too much fuel. 
PHIL Nah, I just didn't factor in the booze inside of him. Gram always... 
He breaks off as a flashing police light appears in the darkness, followed by a siren. 
PHIL (CONT'D) I think our work here is done. 
Larry and Susie run to the car. Phil lingers a moment, looking down at the flames. Then he follows the others. 
INT. HEARSE. NIGHT 
Phil jumps into the car. 
PHIL Go! 
CON TINUE D: 
The huge car screeches off into the darkness, with no lights. 
INT. CAR. NIGHT 
Stanley watches as the hearse flies past him. He glances back at the fire, smiles sadly, and bows his head for a moment. Then he turns on the ignition and drives away into the darkness. 
EXT. DESERT. NIGHT 
The police car arrives at the scene.       Barbara and the cop get out. He peers into the flames. 
TRAFFIC COP How do you know it's your boyfriend? 
BARBARA (sarcastically) I recognize that birthmark on his shoulder. Look, can I make an observation? 
TRAFFIC COP Be my guest. 
BARBARA We're in the desert. It is dark. If you want to catch someone in the dark, it's best not to turn on big flashing lights and make a loud noise with a siren. TRAFFIC COP Do you want to know what I think, ma'am? 
BARBARA No. But I'm really, really keen to find out. 
The traffic cop stares into the fire. 
TRAFFIC COP I think it was suicide. He just wanted to get away from you. 
INT. HEARSE. DAWN 
Phil is fast asleep and snoring in Bernice's passenger seat. He wakes slowly and shields his eyes from the bright sunshine that pours through the windscreen. He pulls a flask out of the glove compartment and takes a long gargle, spitting the result out of the window. 
CON TINUE D: Then he glances in the rear view mirror and sees the man sitting in the casket bay. 
GRAM Sure is hot.

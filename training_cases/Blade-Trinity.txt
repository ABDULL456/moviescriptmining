BLADE : TRINITY 
Over darkness a WOMAN'S VOICE speaks to us. 
ABIGAIL (V.0.) Italo Calvino once said that myth is the hidden part of every story, the buried part, the region that is still unexplored because there are as yet no words to enable us to get there. (beat) But I was there for the end.  I took part in it.  And I think my words can help shed light on what happened.  My name is Abigail.  This is our story. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAWN 
Harsh sunlight beats down over a bleak, unforgiving stretch of rocky desert.  Amidst this desolation rise the ruins of an ancient Sumerian ziggurat, a massive stepped pyramid of mud brick that was once the center of the city known as Ur. 
SUPER TITLE:	SOUTHEASTERN IRAQ, DHI QAR PROVINCE 
SIX MONTHS AGO 
AN EMACIATED SHEEP HERDER 
kneels by the ziggurat, tending to a ragged band of sheep.  He is conducting the first of his daily prayers, listening to a religious broadcast from Baghdad on a tinny RADIO. 
Presently, we hear HELICOPTERS.  The sheepherder looks up -- 
TWO ANERICAN RAH-66 COMANCHE HELICOPTERS 
approach from the East.  They touch down near the base of the ziggurat, rotors stirring up clouds of dust. 
FOUR FIGURES 
disembark, their bodies covered in desert camo-gear.  They wear helmets with polarized face-plates and are armed to the teeth.  To the sheepherder they might as well be aliens. 
One of the figures turns to the East.  We can see the rising sun reflected in the face-plate of his helmet -- and a hint of a skull-like under-mask/respirator beneath the face-plate. He raises a gloved hand, gives the "finger" to the new day. 
Another figure (a woman) waves a hand, urging them onward. They mount the central steps of the ziggurat. 
INT. ZIGGURAT - SHRINE - DAY 
The shrine is empty.  The woman activates a wearable computing device, calling up a schematic of the ziggurat. 
She kneels, studying the floor.  In the corner of the room she identifies a particular brick and presses it.  We hear hidden COUNTER-WEIGHTS shifting and the floor opens up -- 
-- revealing a stone stairway leading down. 
INT. ZIGGURAT - STAIRWAY - DAY 
Dark.  Sepulchral.  Spooky.  The figures descend into -- 
INT. ZIGGURAT - BURIAL VAULT - DAY 
-- an empty room with an earthen floor.  The sunlight from above barely penetrates down here.  One of the figures takes out a battery--powered lantern, turning it on, illuminating -- 
-- walls covered with CUNEIFORM WRITING.  The male figure who flipped off the sun speaks via radio headset. 
MALE FIGURE That's great. We've got dick. (turning to the others) Is there any reason we had to embark on this cluster-fuck during the day? 
The woman removes her helmet.  This is DANICA TALOS.  A vampire.  Intense, appearing to be in her 30s.  Possessing a regal air.  She wears a silver crucifix around her neck. 
DANICA Night-time's too tricky, Grimwood. You know that. 
One by one, the others remove their helmets.  All vampires: 
GRIMWOOD (30s), a hulking vampire with an imposing physique and an even more imposing set of surgical steel teeth/fangs. 
ASHER (4Os), a natural-born leader with easygoing charisma. 
WOLFE (30s), quiet and deliberative.  Right now he's readying a portable ground-penetrating radar unit. 
Grimwood studies the writing on the walls. 
GRIMWOOD What is this chicken-scratch? 
DANICA Cuneiform. Dates back about four thousand years. 
GRIMWOOD So why here? 
DANICA Because this was the cradle of civilization.  He would've been comfortable here. 
ASHER I don't know, Dan.  Seems like another dead-end. 
WOLFE I'm not so sure -- 
Wolfe looks at his unit, excited.  The others gather round. 
--	Blade reaches between the seats, ACTIVATING the newly installed nitrous oxide fuel-injection system. 
EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT 
Hyper-speed.  The Charger jets forward as the NOS nitrous system boosts the car's speed by another 300 HP, leaving any and everything in its dust.  In seconds, it has caught up to -- 
STONE AND CAMPBELL 
They draw TEC-9s, FIRING back at Blade.  The bullet-proof windshield holds as do the kevlar body panels protecting the engine -- but the rounds chew the shit out of the bodywork. 
INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT 
Blade gives his car another jolt of nitrous.  The Charger SURGES FORWARD as Stone and Campbell fall back, veering to either side.  Now Blade is ahead of them.  He checks their position in his rear-view mirror, then stands on the brakes -- 
EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT 
The Charger drops from a hundred to fifty in a heart beat, causing Stone and Campbell to rear-end Blade. 
The vamps are ejected over the handle bars of their bikes like crash-test dummies.  Stone SMASHES through Blade's back windshield, continuing into the front seat-- 
-- while Campbell tumbles over Blade's roof and across his hood, somehow managing to cling to one of the windshield wipers at the last minute. 
INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT 
Blade clutches the wheel.  He's got a HOWLING vampire in the front seat, upside down, covered in windshield fragments and another perched on his hood, obscuring his vision. 
Stone tries to right himself, clawing at Blade.  Blade struggles, keeping one hand on the wheel while he -- 
--	reaches for a shotgun secured between the seats.  He FIRES.  As the vampire ASHES, Blade hits a button on the dash. The passenger door opens, spills Stone onto the road -- 
EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT 
-- right into the path of an oncoming bus!  WHAM!  Stone is ground to paste and -- 
INT. TOUR BUS - NIGHT 
TOURISTS, mostly elderly.  The passengers are jolted in their seats as the wheels of the bus KA-THUMP over Stone's remains -- 
OLD WOMAN I hope that wasn't a dog. 
INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT 
-- and we're back in Blade's Charger as Campbell continues to HAMMER away at the windshield.  The windshield spiderwebs. Campbell manages to get a clawed hand through -- 
Blade swings his shotgun over, shoving it in Campbell's snarling mouth.  He pulls the trigger -- 
BOOM!  Campbell's CINDER-REMAINS blow over the cracked windshield.  Blade hits the wipers, spritzes window cleaner - but the mess turns to ashen sludge.  making the view worse! 
EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT 
The Talor is up ahead, weaving in and out of traffic. Fighting to see, Blade accelerates, gaining ground -- 
The VAMPIRE DRIVER leans out of his own wihdow, looking back at Blade, FIRING an AUTOMATIC PISTOL -- 
INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT 
Blade's windshield, already weakened by Campbell, SHATTERS, blowing glass fragments all over him.  Undaunted, Blade calmly reaches for his dash, hitting a button labeled "UV". 
EXT. BUSY STREET/BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT 
Roof-mounted UV DAYLIGHTS come on, bathing the car ahead and 
(more importantly) the vampire driver with UV LIGHT! 
The vampire at the wheel SHRIEKS, ASHES, leaving the car 
driverless.  Gedge tries to lean over and take the wheel -- 
INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT 
BURNING REMAINS blow back at us.  Then the view clears and -- 
EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT 
--	Blade SLAMS his charger into the Talon.  The cars briefly lock, grinding SPARKS.  Then they disengage.  Blade jerks his steering wheel, gives the Talon ANOTHER SLAM. 
The Talon hits the curb, riding halfway up onto a sidewalk, PLOWING DOWN newspaper vending machines and table-top displays piled with cheap wares, then a phone booth, a food cart. PEDESTRIANS duck for cover and -- 
-- the Talon gets some serious air, ROLLING onto its side as it comes back to earth. 
EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT 
CUMBERLAND Book us a flight, Hale.  Time to take these cowboys down. 
CUT TO: 
WHISTLER (0.S.) Pack of Reds and some matches. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY 
Whistler is buying a pack of cigarettes when he notices	-- 
A BLACK AND WHITE TABLOID 
on display nearby.  The cover story features a BLURRY PHOTO of Blade's recent melee with the vampires. 
Whistler picks up the tabloid, studying it.  Next to the photo is an ARTIST'S SKETCH OF BLADE.  The headline reads: "GUN TOTING PSYCHOPATH CAPTURED ON FILM!" 
Whistler nods to the CASHIER, hands over some more cash. 
WHISTLER I'll take this too. 
EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY 
Whistler exits the store, perusing the tabloid as he walks. We hear the WHIR of a camera's HIGH-SPEED MOTOR DRIVE and -- 
A SERIES OF DIGITAL SHOTS 
capture Whistler as he moves down the sidewalk. 
ANGLE ON AN FBI AGENT 
perched on a nearby roof, taking surveillance photos. 
FBI AGENT Subject is heading West. 
WHIP-PAN to a parked CAR, Cumberland and Hale seated within. 
CUMBERLAND Got him. 
Cumberland starts the car, starts following Whistler. 
WHISTLER (0.S.) Congratulations.  You're famous.  Just what we needed. 
INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - DAY 
CLOSE ON the tabloid as Whistler slaps it down on a workbench. WIDEN to include Whistler and Blade. 
WHISTLER Somebody screwed us.  Your face is all over the papers, the television.  Media's eating it up. 
BLADE Like I care? 
WHISTLER You should.  Something like this -- (gesturing to the tabloid) -- taking out a human, even one working for the vampires -- far as the rest of the world's concerned, you're public enemy number one. 
BLADE Didn't realize this was a popularity contest. 
Whistler shakes his head, frustrated. 
WHISTLER Damnit, Blade, don't you see what's happening?!  The fuckers are finally getting smart.  They're waging a goddamn PR campaign.  Now it's not just vampires we have to worry about, we're gonna have to take on the rest of the world too. (beat, adamant) They've got us on the run.  These last few months we've barely been staying ahead of the curve. 
BLADE You worry too much, old man. 
WHISTLER I've been doing this since before you were born, Blade.  The moment you stop worrying, you're dead. 
Then Whistler's face softens for a moment. 
WHISTLER Since the day I found you, you've been like a son to me.  I taught you everything I know. (beat) But I'm tired.  You understand? 
EXT. INNER CITY STREET - NIGHT 
It's rush hour and the streets are choked with traffic. PEOPLE mill past on the crowded sidewalk. 
We move from face to face, capturing brief portraits of working-class desperation -- an OVERWEIGHT GUY, a PAIR OF HOMELESS TEENAGERS, an ASIAN VENDOR, a STREETWALKER. 
VOICE (O.S) How about that one? 
SECOND VOICE (O.S.) No fatties.  They taste like Cheetos. 
THIRD VOICE (O.S.) What about that shrunken apple-head beeyatch-a-saurus over there? 
VOICE (O.S.) Fucking blow me, man! 
ABIGAIL 
jumps to her feet, shedding her coat and hat.  Long tresses of hair spill around her shoulders.  She's not mousy at all.  In fact, she's beautiful.  And cut like an Olympic athlete.  And equipped with a walking arsenal of weapons. 
Dingo SNARLS -- CRUNCH!  Abigail plants her heel in his face, SMASHING IN his nose.  She does a cartwheel, KICKS him again. Follows that with flurry of PUNCHES.  He goes down as -- 
-- Flick and Squid come charging!  Squid gets her in a CHOKE HOLD.  She FLIPS him over her shoulder, KICKING him in the nuts as he lands.  He curls up, GROANING -- 
Abigail turns back to Flick, ELBOWING him in the throat -- 
-- then returns to Squid, ejecting a SILVER THROWING KNIFE from a spring-loaded, automated dispenser strapped to her wrist.  She POPs the knife through Squid's chest.  He ASHES -- 
FOLLOWING ABIGAIL 
as she reaches behind her, removing a CRESCENT-SHAPED DEVICE secured to her back.  She holds the crescent in the center, the curve pointing away from her, gives it a twist and -- 
CHINKT!  The device extends from either end, telescoping outward into a three-foot long metal arc.  Connecting the two ends of the arc is a powerful, BUZZING UV LASER. 
Abigail LASHES OUT, lopping off Flick's arm.  His arm falls, ASHING.  Abigail swings the arc around, pushing it forward through Flick's mid-section like a cheese cutter -- 
Flick literally falls apart, his upper torso sliding from his trunk, ASHING in the foreground, his burning particles falling away to reveal Abigail in the background -- 
Dingo scrambles to his feet, running for his life. 
Abigail gives her UV arc a twist.  It retracts.  She secures it behind her back once again, unholsters a strange-looking "bloop" GUN with a large barrel.  She FIRES -- 
A rapidly-expanding spherule of ANTI-PERSONNEL FOAM splatters against Dingo's legs, hardening instantly, tripping him up -- 
Dingo goes down again.  He panics, trying to scrape the gunk off his legs, manages to get one of his hands stuck to the hardening mess in the process -- like a mouse in a glue-trap. 
Abigail calmly approaches.  She stands over Dingo, staring down at him with a look of cruel indifference.  She holsters her bloop gun, withdraws another SILVER STAKE -- 
ABIGAIL Scream if this hurts, chica. 
-- and SLAMS the stake into his chest. 
WIDEN OUT 
Abigail turns, surveying her work.  The ashen remains of the vampires are popping and crackling like campfire embers.  In thirty-seven seconds she's managed to eliminate them all. 
A train approaches, pulls into the station.  PASSENGERS disembark, flood the platform.  They tramp all over the ashes of the vampires, completely unaware of the recent slaughter. 
Abigail walks against the stream of traffic, boards the train. She is the sole passenger as the train pulls away. 
INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - WHISTLER'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Whistler sits on a cot, contemplating the tarnished wedding ring on his hand.  He slowly spins it around his finger. 
INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BLADE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Blade sits before a small Buddhist shrine, meditating. Incense burns.  His sword rests in a ceremonial holder.  Near silence punctuated by the intermittent ocean swell outside. 
CLOSE ON BLADE'S FACE 
We hear the SOUNDS OF VIOLENCE -- ECHOING SCREAMS, GUNSHOTS. These are Blade's thoughts.  The inner demons he is constantly trying to tame.  The sounds CRESCENDO and -- 
--	Blade opens his eyes.  He listens.  Something is wrong. 
INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT 
Blade creeps into the outer room, sword drawn. 
NOISE behind him, turns to see -- 
WHISTLER 
standing in the shadows, clutching a handgun. 
WHISTLER What is it? 
BLADE What you've been worrying about. 
They listen.  Just the sound of the ocean swell.  Then -- 
A WINDOW SHATTERS 
TWO ARMORED SWAT AGENTS lower in on rappelling lines. 
TWO MORE AGENTS 
CRASH through a bank of windows on either side, swinging in. They FIRE cannisters of TEAR GAS.  As Blade moves to engage them, Whistler RUSHES into the heart of the armory -- 
CRASH!  The three of them come FLYING DOWN in a spray of glass, landing atop one of the police cruisers below.  The roof buckles under their weight, windows SHATTERING -- 
CUMBERLAND Take him down! 
An FBI AGENT raises a CODA net gun atop his shoulder, taking aim.  BA-BANG!  Four projectiles expand out from the barrel, carrying a STEEL NET which has been strung between them. 
The netting hits Blade, wrapping around him, restricting his movements.  Immediately, a small army of agents DIVE on top of him, PUMMELING AWAY, trying to beat him into submission -- 
INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT 
On the verge of losing consciousness, Whistler props himself against a piece of machinery.  He's bleeding, been shot to hell.  One of his hands is closed, clutching something. 
Agents warily close in around him, guns raised. 
AGENT Move a finger and you're dead. 
WHISTLER (flipping them off) How 'bout this one? 
Whistler lets his other hand uncurl. He's got a REMOTE in his palm, with a tiny digital timer counting-down. 
AGENT #2 He's got something in his-- 
00:03.  00:02.  00:01.  The timer reaches zero. 
A SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS 
rock the workshop, knocking the agents back. 
EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT 
CLOUDS OF FIRE and FLAMING DEBRIS MUSHROOM OUTWARD, catching all unawares, sweeping them up off their feet with a hurricane force.  In the midst of the conflagration -- 
-- Blade briefly manages to tear free of his captors -- 
BLADE WHISTLER!!! 
-- but the wall of FIRE and LIGHT is rushing onward, sweeping up everything in its path, turning the world to white. 
INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 
FADE IN.  We are CLOSE ON Blade's perspiration-beaded face. His eyelids flutter as he slowly regains consciousness. 
CUMBERLAND (O.S.) Rise and shine, sleepyhead. 
PULL BACK.  We are in a room with a one-way mirrored window. Blade sits, hands cuffed behind him, BRIGHT LIGHTS shining down on him.  He looks disoriented, battered.  Very weak. 
Cumberland and Hale are sitting across from Blade. 
BLADE Who --? 
CUMBERLAND Special Agents Ray Cumberland and Wilson Hale, FBI.  We've been tracking you for a long time. 
BLADE Whistler -- 
HALE Dead.  Just like all of your victims. 
Blade shuts his eyes -- as if he could just wish them away. 
CUMBERLAND How many people have you killed?  Thirty? Forty?  A hundred? 
BLADE Those were familiars -- people who worked for them -- 
CUMBERLAND And by "them" you mean vampires, right? I suppose next you'll be telling us that Bigfoot's in on the conspiracy too? So what kills these bloodsu~kers, tough guy? Maybe you can give us some pointers. (counting on his ringers) You can stake 'em, right?  Then there's sunlight -- what about crosses, Wilson? Do those still work? 
HALE I don't know, Ray.  What if a vampire's Jewish? 
CUMBERLAND That's a good point.  And does garlic work on a Hindu vampire?  Or do you need saffron or something? 
Hale laughs.  Cumberland shakes his head, his smile fading. 
CUMBERLAND You can keep doing your song and dance as long as you want, Blade, but it's not going to play.  You're a stone-cold killer.  And you're sick as fuck. 
VANCE (O.S.) Let's leave the diagnosis to the professionals. 
ANGLE ON DR. EDGAR VANCE, 
standing in the doorway.  He's the man we saw on Larry King. He takes a seat by Blade, sets a leather case on a table. 
VANCE Hello, Blade.  My name is Doctor Vance. I'm with the Department of Mental Health. I've been charged with conducting a psychiatric evaluation of you. (to Cumberland and Hale) Gentleman, would you mind giving us a few moments alone? 
Cumberland nods.  They rise, exiting the room.  Vance smiles, trying to project a sympathetic air. 
Blade looks to the one-way mirror, SCREAMS. 
BLADE He's one of them!  Damnit, he's working for them! 
Vance looks to the one-way mirror as well and shrugs as if to say -- "The man's deranged.  What can I do?" 
INT. POLICE STATION - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT 
On the other side of the glass, Blade looks like a raging lunatic.  Vance enters.  He extends his hand to Vreede. 
They shake.  As they do so, we SEE a vampire GLYPH on the inside of Vreede's wrist as well.  Another familiar. 
INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Blade stares at his own reflection in the mirror.  He blinks, trying to focus -- but the drug is starting to kick in. 
INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
An elevator door opens.  Asher, Danica, and Grimwood exit, followed by the orderlies who are now wheeling the gurney.  As they move down the corridor, they pass -- 
-- Cumberland and Hale, who are chasing down Chief Vreede. 
CUMBERLAND Just hold it right there -- 
Danica shoves Cumberland aside, hard, keeps moving past him. 
Cumberland looks to Hale.  Something isn't right about this. 
INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Blade struggles, in the full throes of the drug now. 
BLADE'S POV 
His vision is blurring, various objects in the room leaving trails as he shifts his head from side to side and -- 
ASHER, DANICA, AND GRIMWOOD 
enter, followed by two of the orderlies.  Despite his incapacitation, Blade attempts to rise.  Danica plants her heel in his chest, shoving him back down. 
DANICA Easy, lover. You're not going anywhere. 
She draws closer, enjoying herself. 
DANICA We moved the humans around like, pawns, Blade.  Used them to flush you out. 
Blade tries to LUNGE from his chair at her and -- WHACK! Grimwood punches Blade across the jaw.  A brutal blow. 
GRIMWOOD Don't worry, Captain Sunshine.  Soon as we get you out of here, you'll get a chance to play. 
Danica motions to the two vampire orderlies.  They step forward with the straight-jacket, start to put it on Blade. Blade THRASHES madly.  Asher LAUGHS, enjoying this. 
DANICA Don't make this any harder than it has to be.  You're all alone, Blade.  No one can help you now. 
BA-BOOM!  The one-way mirror SHATTERS, exploding outward in a shower of SLOW-MOTION GLASS FRAGMENTS, carrying with it -- 
-- a BODY, one of the vampire mental health flunkies -- 
ASHING in mid-air as he sails into the room!  Seconds later -- 
A MAN 
VAULTS through the blown-out window, simultaneously drawing two high-tech electronic pistols. Meet HANNIBAL KING (30s), an audacious vampire hunter with an irrepressible grin.  Slapped to his chest is a "Hello, my name is" sticker with the words "FUCK YOU" written where the name should be. 
KING Why'd the Polish vampire starve to death? 
Danica spins, enraged, recognizing King instantly -- 
KING He kept biting his own lip. 
DANICA King! 
The lights go out.  Immediately, backup lights come on, followed by FIRE ALARMS.  In the ensuing confusion ~ both pistols at Asher, who drops, allowing one of the vampire orderlies behind him to take the hit. 
THE VAMPIRE ORDERLY ASHES 
But unlike Blade's victims, he disintegrates from the inside out.  (The reason is King's signature bullets -- SUN DOGS, explosive rounds that give off concentrated UV light.) 
King whips around, FIRING at -- 
-- Danica, who LEAPS behind the table.  She quickly upends it, using it as a shield, FLINGING it at King. 
A tiny "egg-timer" dial on the arrowhead spins.  It CLICKS in place, a RED LED comes on, and -- 
--	the arrowhead EXPLODES, catching all three vampires with the full force of a UV BLAST.  Grimwood ducks away from the blast as the other two vampires ASH -- 
BLADE, KING, AND ABIGAIL 
come racing out of the alcove.  They reach a stairwell.  Blade RIPS a steel door clear off its hinges, tossing it down the stairwell at a phalanx of COP REINFORCEMENTS who are charging up the stairs.  The cops go down like ten-pins. 
Blade and company have an opening.  But as they charge downward -- 
BLADE (as King and Abigail freeze) My sword.  They still have it. 
KING (apoplectic) Are you insane?!  We're practically home free!  We can't go hunting for your fucking butter-knife now! 
But Blade is already heading back the way they came and -- 
KING Hey!  HEY!!!  COME BACK HERE!!!  This is supposed to be a rescue! 
-- Abigail grabs King's shoulder, pulling him to the stairs. 
ABIGAIL Forget it, King.  Let's move. 
POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
King and Abigail rush outside.  The station is gated. FLASHING POLICE CARS are surging through the mouth of the gate. They're trapped.  Then -- 
CRASH! 
A window on the third floor of the station EXPLODES OUTWARD. Blade drops three stories, landing before King and Abigail in a cat-like crouch.  With his sword in his hand.  He looks at King, grins, flips him off. 
BLADE Now we can go. 
KING (nudging Abigail) Is he epic or what? 
The police close in around them, pinning the trio down with FIREPOWER.  Yet King and Abigail seem unconcerned because -- 
HEADLIGHTS 
are washing over them.  A beefed-up, 70s Land Cruiser is SCREAMING up the street.  The Cruiser jumps onto the sidewalk, SMASHES right through the gated wall.  SCREECHES to a stop between our trio and the police cars. 
A DRIVER (DEX) 
leans out his window, gives a little wave as the rear doors pop open.  Gruff and compact, he looks like a prize-fighter. 
DEX My name is Dex.  And I'll be saving your ass this evening. 
Blade, King, and Abigail scramble into the back of the Land Cruiser.  Dex reverses, backing out the way he came. 
The police from the squad cars are FIRING, but the Land Cruiser is armored and the bullets harmlessly SPARK off. 
INT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT 
In the backseat, Abigail looks through the rear windshield -- 
ABIGAIL'S POV 
Grimwood is running after them, actually gaining on the Land Cruiser.  Chewing up the asphalt like a cheetah. 
EXT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT 
Abigail leans out the rear window, nocking a non-UV arrow in her bow.  She takes aim at Grimwood, lets the arrow fly -- 
SHUNKT!  The arrow sinks into Grimwood's eye.  He goes down, his somersaulting figure quickly receding into the background as the Land Cruiser speeds away. 
INT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT 
Safe for the moment, King basks in the adrenaline rush of a battle well fought.  Meanwhile, Dex is on a cell phone. 
DEX We have him.  We'll be there soon. 
KING (to Blade) So my entrance back there -- what do you think?  Too flashy?  Right on the money? 
King unhuckles his combat harness, revealing a bullet-proof vest bereath it that's been riddled with imbedded slugs. 
BLADE Who are you people? 
KING My name's Hannibal King.  I'm a hunter, like you. (re: Abigail) And this little hellion is Abigail Whistler. 
Abigail just stares back at Blade, silently appraising him. 
KING That's right, Blade.  You're not hearing things.  She's Whistler's daughter.  You see, Abby, Dex, myself -- we're all part of Whistler's "contingency plan". 
BLADE And what makes you think you know so much about killing vampires? 
King reaches for his collar, pulling it down to reveal a telltale mass of scar tissue in the shape of a BITE MARK. 
KING Well for starters, I used to be one. (in a sinister tone) Do I pass the audition? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - NIGHT 
We soar through the night sky, diving down towards a cluster of gleaming, high-tech spires.  As we isolate a penthouse apartment atop one of them we hear an ANGRY SCREAM. 
DANICA (O.S.) Fucking Hannibal King! 
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT 
An impressively decorated loft bespeaking of money, power, and a certain perverse esthetic.  Danica slams her fist straight through the wall, then spins around, enraged. 
Asher and Grimwood are there too, their wounds being treated by Hendrix and a VAMPIRE TECHNICIAN.  At tie moment, they're trying to remove the arrow protruding from Grimwood's eye. 
An enormous ROTTWEILER sits nearby, attentively watching. A TRIO OF GUARDS flinch with every act of violence. Danica is strong.  Clearly, no one wants to get in her way. 
DANICA I should've ripped his ripped his bleeding heart out when I had the chance! (pointing at Asher) And don't you dare tell me "I told you so"! 
Asher raises his hands as if to say "no harm, no foul". Danica continues her tantrum, SMASHING a statue apart, SHATTERING a heavy glass tabletop.  Finally, she gives it a rest, collapsing into a chair, shoulders sagging. 
ASHER You through remodeling? 
DANICA Blow me. 
ASHER Face it, Dan.  We got caught with our pants down.  We underestimated the Nightstalkers. 
GRIMWOOD Pants down?!  They practically fucking ass-raped us! 
Grimwood GRUNTS in pain as the arrow is removed.  Asher broaches a more serious subject. 
ASHER Has he been told yet? 
VOICE (O.S.) About your failure? 
A MAN (30s) enters the room.  The same being we glimpsed in the vault.  He has a haunting gaze and a commanding presence. We will learn who he is momentarily.  But for now, it's enough to know that everyone in the room pays him deference. 
MAN Yes, I've been told. 
He places a hand on Danica's shoulder.  She tenses. 
MAN Perhaps it's time I entered the fray. 
CUT TO: 
INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON King buttoning his collar back up.  Blade, Abigail, and Sommerfield are gathered around him. 
KING You know the kind of woman that just screams trouble? You see her and every warning bell in your brain starts going off but you still ask for her number? Well that's all I ever hook up with.  But this betty blew 'em all away in the shitstorm sweepstakes. 
King reaches out to a keyboard, calling up a piece of surveillance footage on a nearby monitor.  The footage features Asher and Danica and Grimwood.  It's been slowed to a near standstill and now advances frame by frame. 
KING Her name's Danica Talos.  You met her earlier.  The man on her left is Asher, her brother. 
King types a command.  The image ZOOMS IN, tracking Grimwood. 
KING The neanderthal behind them is Jarko Grimwood. 
King freezes the footage on Danica's grainy, pixelated face. 
KING I picked Danica up in a bar, had a one night stand with her -- then spent the next five years playing step-and-fetch-it as her little vampire cabana boy. (beat) Eventually Abigail found me.  Sommerfield here managed to treat me with a cure.  Now I kill them. (beat) That's called turning a frown upside down. 
ABIGAIL We need to pool our resources, Blade. 
BLADE Why? 
ABIGAIL Because He's come back. 
King tosses a TOMB OF DRACULA comic book over to Blade.  Blade glances at the cover, then looks at them, incredulous. 
BLADE You gotta be kidding me. 
KING He's real, Blade.  Dig beneath all the movies and myths.  All the layers of bullshit that've cluttered our culture for the last five hundred years and eventually you'll strike the truth. 
BLADE (incredulous) So the movies are true? 
ON DRAKE, 
viewed through a long-lens, clad in modern, casual attire, striding in SLOW-MOTION down a PEDESTRIAN-CHOKED sidewalk. 
Slower.  A HEARTBEAT.  The pulse of the people.  And over this, intruding, the Doppler effect WAILING of an approaching car as it rushes past us in a SCREEN WIPE until we are -- 
OUTSIDE A GOTH STORE 
Drake studies a window display.  Halloween merchandise. Costumes and monster masks and -- VAMPIRE NOVELTIES.  We see vampire lunchboxes, Dracula plush dolls, plastic fangs, key chains.  Even Dracula bobbleheads. 
Drake stands in stark contrast to the mass-marketed caricature on display before him. 
INT. GOTH STORE - NIGHT 
Drake enters. The store is crowded with low-end junky goods that might appeal to tourists visiting Hollywood Boulevard. 
A pallid, Goth-guy CASHIER sits behind a counter, eating from a takeout container.  He's wafer thin, with a detached attitude.  A snot.  Further back is a sultry GOTH VIXEN. 
Behind them, on a TV, a cartoon is playing. An animated vampire cavorts -- "LITTLE BIT" (like the Hot Stuff devil from Ritchie Rich comicbooks) 
DRAKE In the window -- you sell vampire merchandise? 
Goth Guy looks up, wiping his mouth with a napkin.  Doesn't want to engage with Drake at all. 
GOTH GUY Uh, yeah -- look around, we might have a few things. 
He and the Goth Vixen have a snicker at Drake's expense.  Then she tries to be a little more helpful. 
GOTH VIXEN We've got Dracula lunchboxes.  Did you see those?  And there're bobbleheads, Pez dispensers.  We've got just about anything -- (selecting a vampire- shaped vibrator, playful) -- even vampire vibrators. 
As Drake looks around, what he sees matches his ascending rage.  Costumes, candles, vampire Christmas ornaments. Posters from different films -- Nosferatu, Lugosi, Lee -- then Love at First Bite and The Little Vampire. 
GOTH VIXEN Here, check this out -- 
She reaches into a case, pulling out a soft-drink.  The label reads: "DRA-COLA" and has a stylized vampire on it. 
GOTH VIXEN "Dracola".  Makes you want to cry, doesn't it? 
Drake just stares at the can.  His mind seems to have retreated elsewhere.  Back through the ages. 
GOTH VIXEN Was there something special you needed? 
Drake doesn't respond.  A kind of melancholy has settled over him.  He's an outsider now.  The world has moved on. 
GOTH-GUY Hey, guy, she's talking to you. 
Drake looks up as Goth Guy pours a bowl of Count Chocula. 
EXT. GOTH STORE - NIGHT 
CRASH!  Goth Guy comes flying through the display window, his trajectory taking his body clear across the street and into the display window of the store opposite us. 
INT. GOTH STORE - NIGHT 
Goth Vixen SCREAMS.  Drake LASHES out.  hauling her over the counter.  He sinks his teeth into her throat, drinking her blood with wild abandon.  He consumes it so quickly that his skin flushes BRIGHT RED. 
Then Drake tears his head away, lifting his face upward as he flings the girl aside, unleashing an ear-splitting ROAR.  And for a brief moment, the bones of his face seem to shift, once again hinting at another shape Drake might take. 
EXT. THE CITY - VARIOUS 
DRAKE's ROAR echoes through the canyons of downtown. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LUNA PARK - NIGHT/DAY 
Time-lapse.  The sun rises over the decrepit amusement park. 
INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - ARMORY - DAWN Sunlight slices down through skylights, bathing Blade, King, Abigail, and Sommerfield in its warmth.  Zoe has joined them. She's still cautious and shy, but she's also curious. 
BLADE Why wake up Drake now? 
ABIGAIL That's what we've been trying to figure out. 
KING When I was under the fang there used to be talk about some kind of vampire 'Final Solution'.  But I could never figure out why they'd want to destroy their food source.  I mean, seems stupid, right? They've always had plans for the human race.  Seems likely that whatever they're cooking up, Drake's return is a part of it. 
Blade nods, pensive. 
KING (CONT'D) Let's face it, Blade -- we're fighting a losing battle. So we kill a few hundred of them a year. Big deal.  There are thousands of them out there.  Maybe tens of th'usands.  We need a new tactic. 
BLADE Like what? 
Hedges tosses King one of the four-barreled firearms.  On the stock is an irreverent decal of the mud-flap girl silhouette. 
KING This little mamacita -- a modified version of the Army's Objective Individual Combat Weapon.  Pick your poison -- stakes, sun dogs, heat-seeking mini-rockets.  Whatever gets you hard, this puppy will pump out. (gesturing to Blade's sword, sarcastic) Of course it doesn't have the range of a sword but -- 
Next, Hedges shows Blade the CRESCENT-SHAPED DEVICE that Abigail used.  He gives the device a twist and -- 
HEDGES We call this the UV arc -- 
CHINKT!  The device extends from either end, telescoping outward.  Connecting the tips is a concentrated UV LASER. 
HEDGES You hold the arc in the center, curved away from you.  Connecting the tips is a powerful UV laser beam.  Because of its high focus, the laser cuts through vampire flesh like a knife through butter. 
KING We're still trying to sort out fact from fiction when it comes to Dracula.  Turning into mist?  Kinda doubt it.  But general shape-shifting?  Maybe. 
HEDGES (off Blade's look) Not into a bat or a wolf or anything like that.  But another human, someone with the same approximate body mass -- given enough practice it might be possible. 
BLADE How? 
HEDGES He wouldn't have a traditional skeletal structure.  Probably something more like a snake, with thousands of tiny bones in the place of a normal array.  Commensurate with this would be an exquisite control of electrical potential across his tissues, resulting in an ability to effectively change shape at will -- 
KING (raising his hand) Question.  Have you ever been laid, Hedges? 
CUT TO: 
INT. WAREHOUSE/GARAGE - DAY 
Blade, King, and Abigail, newly suited up for war, moving towards the Land Cruiser. 
BLADE Time to apply some pressure.  The weak link in the vampire chain of command has always been their familiars.  Vampires can't go out in the day, so they get humans to do their dirty work for them Blood-running, safe house maintenance, whatever -- (climbing in the Cruiser) We bleed the wanna-be vampires, they'll lead us to the real thing. 
Blade starts the ENGINE. 
INT. LAND CRUISER - DAY 
Blade looks to Abigail, who sits in the back.  She has a laptop on her knees and is assembling an MP3 playlist. 
KING She's making playlists.  Likes to listen to MP3s when she hunts.  Her own internal soundtrack, you know?  Dark-core, trip hop, whatever kids these days are listening to.  Me?   I'm more of a Kenny G fan. 
Finished, Abigail slips her earbuds into her ears, turns on her portable MP3 player.  MUSIC CUE.  The smoking bassline of Jurassic 5's 'A Day At The Races' kicks in as -- 
EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS - DAY 
-- Blade, King, and Abigail cruise the streets in a jagged fast-forward montage. 
EXT. SEEDY BAR - DAY 
The Land Cruiser jumps the curb, SCREECHING to a stop in front of a scuzzy bar.  Amidst a wall covered with graffiti and flyers we see a vampire glyph. 
INT. SEEDY BAR - DAY 
BANG!  Blade KICKS open the door.  A couple of LOW-LIFES take notice.  Blade moves around the bar, opening a refrigerator - we see packs of REFRIGERATED BLOOD inside. 
One of the low-lifes takes off running, back past the bathroom, shouldering a door at the rear -- 
EXT. SEEDY BAR - REAR ENTRANCE - DAY 
--	STUMBLING right into Abigail's arms.  She trips him up, swinging him around, pinning an arm behind him.  She pulls the back of his collar down, sees a VAMPIRE GLYPH -- 
We can't hear what the familiar is saying, but he's squealing, raising his hands in a "please don't hit me anymore" manner. 
EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS - DAY 
The Land Cruiser rockets down the streets. 
EXT. VAMPIRE SAFE HOUSES - VARIOUS - DAY 
In quick succession we see a half-dozen underworld dives -- 
-- a pool hall -- 
-- an internet cafe -- 
-- an electronics repair shop -- 
All are fronts for vampire operations, featuring back rooms with refrigerated blood and high-tech coffin-like beds where the vampires can safely sleep through the day unmolested. 
In each new location, Blade, King, and Abigail resort to oldfashioned strong-arm tactics: 
-- Blade HEAD-BUTTS a familiar. 
-- King PUNCHES a familiar across the jaw. 
DRAKE Yes.  My children seek to isolate the properties in my blood that make me immune to sunlight.  Through me, they believe they can all become Daywalkers. 
Drake glances down at the street people.  Throngs of PEOPLE are massing there, pointing up at him. 
DRAKE The world's changed much since I went to sleep.  How crowded it's become.  Look at them down there.  Lives brief as fireflies.  Do you think they can ever grasp what it means to be immortal like us? 
BLADE You're not immortal.  I must've heard a hundred of you people make the same claim. And every one of them's seen the end of my sword. 
Drake smiles, intrigued by an obviously worthy opponent. 
DRAKE Perhaps I will as well, then.  But I think it's more likely that you will fall before mine. (beat) Catch. 
Drake tosses the infant at Blade.  Blade twists around to catch it, scooping it safely up.  But when he looks back -- 
-- Drake is gone. 
KING (O.S.) Shit! 
INT. VANCE INSTITUTE - VANCE'S OFFICE - DAY 
CLOSE ON King being propped up against the wall by Abigail. Blade has joined them.  King is in terrible pain. 
KING Jesus, it hurts.  I wanna be a vampire again -- fuck!  Did you see that guy?! We're gonna lose, man.  We're gonna fucking lose. 
Abigail ignores King, cuts open his shirt.  She removes a small aerosol cannister from her belt. 
BLADE What's that? 
ABIGAIL Fibrin sealant foam, it's an elastic protein.  Help me spread the wound open. The foam should seal the hemorrhaging in his body cavity from within -- 
Together they spread the wound apart.  King is really hurting, breathing hard as he tries to fight back the pain. 
KING Hey, hey -- what'd the one lesbian vampire say to the other? 
ABIGAIL Shut up, King. 
KING -- see you in twenty-eight days -- 
King's voice trails off as he passes out.  Abigail triggers the dispenser, spraying a jet of compressed foam into it.  The foam condenses, sealing the wound up. 
INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
Blade and Abigail enter the HQ, hauling King between them. Dex and Hedges rush to meet them, relieving them of King. 
Exhausted and covered in blood, Abigail retires to her quarters, stripping off her clothes. 
INT. NIGHTSTALKERS' HEADQUARTERS - SHOWERS - DAY 
Abigail stands beneath (he showerhead, turning her face up into the scalding spray, rinsing the blood from her body. 
CLOSE ON the drain by her feet, BLOOD swirling down it. 
INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - INFIRMARY - DAY 
King drowses on a cot.  His shirt is off and his chest has been bandaged.  He opens his eyes, SEES Blade above him. 
KING Hey, Blade -- say we're successful.  Say we wipe the vampires out.  What happens then?  You ever ask yourself that? (weakly) Somehow I don't picture you parked on a porch with a jigsaw puzzle. 
King drifts back into unconsciousness again, leaving Blade left to ponder his words. 
INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - LABORATORY AREA - DAY 
Later, Sommerfield and Hedges consult with Blade and Abigail. 
HEDGES So basically we're in an arms race. They're using Drake's DNA to build themselves a better vampire -- 
BLADE (noddin) -- and we need his blood to kill them. (to Sommerfield) How's this weapon of yours coming along? 
SODDERFIELD We're almost there -- 
She gestures to a series of ampule-like prototypes.  (We'll see the completed version of this device later on.) 
SOMMERFIELD The virus is harmless to humans.  So we decided to go after the vampires' food source.  The one thing we know for sure about vampires is that they have to drink blood. If we manage to pull this off, we'll be able to contaminate every blood source on the planet.  They won't have anyone left to feed on. 
ABIGAIL Doesn't do us any good if we don't have time to finish it.  We can't just sit here.  We need to take the battle to them. 
Sommerfield lowers her head, thinking. 
SOMMERFIELD If the vampires are trying to isolate the hereditary factor in Drake that makes him immune to sunlight, they'll require certain kinds of laboratory equipment and provisions.  For instance, there's an enzyme called Taq Polymerase.  And there are only a limited number of suppliers. (beat) Give me a few hours.  I'll see if I can't hunt us up some leads. 
CUT TO: 
The girl scurries away.  Sommerfield TAP-TAPS with her cane, moving towards the storage area.  She finds a gun cabinet, feels around with her hands, locates an electronic pistol. 
INT. NGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - STORAGE AREA - NIGHT 
Sommerfield enters.  Dex and Hedges are sprawled on the floor before her, having been slaughtered.  Blood is everywnere. She doesn't see them, of course.  But we do. 
THE CAMERA SHIFTS AROUND, 
revealing Whistler crouched right behind her! 
She's unaware of his presence.  And as we watch, his facial features shift.  We hear the sickening sounds of CARTILAGE POPPING and we realize that it's Drake, not Whistler. 
With mounting dread, Sommerfield turns towards the sound.  And then Drake is upon her, rushing forward with a GROWL. 
INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
As Sommerfield's AGONIZED SCREAMS echo through the warehouse, Zoe rushes into the bathroom, looking for a place to hide. She considers the lockers, discounts them.  Then settles on -- 
A HEATING GRATE 
near the floor.  It's about fourteen inches wide -- just barely big enough for her to squeeze into. 
Zoe kneels, prying the grate off.  Inside, a heating duct extends four feet before making a ninety-degree turn upward. Zoe climbs into the duct feet first, scooting her body backwards.  Then she reaches for the grate, securing it back on, sealing herself inside. 
INT. HEATING DUCT - NIGHT 
Zoe waits.  It's cramped and claustrophobic inside the duct. She's managed to force herself all the way back to the ninety degree turn by curling up into a near fetal position. 
ZOE'S POV (THROUGH GRATE) 
Mostly tile floor and a small portion of the open doorway leading to the hallway outside. 
She listens, trying to hear past the sound of her own 
BREATHING which has been magnified because of the ducting. 
The screams from the outer rooms have stopped.  Then -- 
ZOE'S POV (THROUGH GRATE) 
A pair of boots appear in the doorway -- Drake. 
Zoe holds her breath.  We HEAR Drake searching the bathroom, opening the lockers and bathroom stalls. 
ZOE'S POV (THROUGH GRATE) Drake's boot-clad feet pass by the grate again, closer, tn~s time. They pause for an interminable moment -- 
Zoe shuts her eyes.  She can't stand it.  Finally, we hear Drake's FOOTSTEPS receding away.  Relieved, Zoe takes in a breath and opens her eyes -- 
ZOE'S POV (THROUGH GRATE) 
Drake's face is right there.  pressed up against the other side of the grate, staring at her! 
Zoe SCREAMS.  With a ROAR, Drake rips the grate off.  He tries to climb inside, but the width of the duct is too narrow to accommodate the size of his upper body. 
Instead, he reaches his right arm in, extending his clawed hand as far as he possibly can.  Zoe WHIMPERS, trying to compress her mass into an even tighter ball -- 
ON DRAKE'S HAND, 
having reached the limits of its extension -- his fingertips 
only a few scant inches from Zoe's face. 
Zoe's been allowed a moment's reprieve.  He can't reach her! 
But then we hear the sound of POPPING CARTILAGE.  Of TINY BONES shifting beneath Drake's flesh.  Drake's fingers are elongating, snake-like Reaching for Zoe's face, rapidly closing the space whici1 separates them -- 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LUNA PARK/GARAGE - NIGHT 
The real Blade and Abigail are returning.  The sliding garage door opens and the Land Cruiser glides inside. 
INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT 
Blade and Abigail enter.  The place is dark.  They know instinctively that somethong is wrong. 
Blade tries a nearby light.  The power is out.  They both draw their weapons.  Blade turns on a FLASHLIGHT.  They move onto the darkness -- 
SHADOWS loom everywhere.  It's like a tornado touched down inside.  Equipment lies smashed, tables and chairs have been overturned.  Sommerfield's lab area has been destroyed. 
ABIGAIL King -- 
DANICA Poor little King.  You look so distraught. 
Danica wipes a little blood from the corner of King's mouth. She touches her fingertips to her tongue, tasting his blood. 
DANICA You're tasting a little bland, lover.  Not getting enough fatty acids in your diet? Have you tried mackerel?  Lake trout? 
KING How about you take a sugar-frosted fuck off the end of my dick? 
DANICA Oh, there'll be time to play doctor later, believe me.  But for now, we need to have a little talk. (beat) Tell us about this bio-weapon you've been building. 
KING I can tell you two things.  Diddly.  And shit.  And diddly just left the building. 
Grimwood steps forward, throttling King for a moment. 
GRINWOOD Spit it out, you fucking fruitcake! 
KING Okay, here's the deal with the weapon - (coughing) It's a new flavor crystal formula.  Twice the chocolaty-goodness, half the calories. Plus, it helps prevent tooth decay -- 
Grimwood moves in to choke him again, but Danica intervenes. 
DANICA You're brave, King, I'll give you that. But underneath all your swagger -- 
She leans closer, caressing his face. 
DANICA -- I know what you really fear.   What would hurt you more than anything else. 
King's smile falters for a moment.  Maybe she does know.  She rubs her cheek against his. 
DANICA You don't want to go back to being one of us -- (her lips grazing his) -- do you? 
King tries to turn his head away, but Danica grips his chin, turning his head back.  He's sweating now.  Worried. 
DANICA I'm going to bite you again, King.  And then I'm going to leave you here while you turn.  I'm going to watch you, day after day, while the Thirst keeps building and building.  And then, when you can't stand it anymore -- 
She nods.  Drake appears, holding Zoe.  She's alive. Terrified.  Held firm in Drake's arms. 
DANICA -- I'm going to bring the little girl for you to feed on.  Would you like that, King?  Would you enjoy taking her life? 
King shuts his eyes, sickened at the thought.  Danica smiles. 
DANICA Now we're getting somewhere, my pet. 
CUT TO: 
INT. NIGHTSTALKERS' HEADQUARTERS - SHOOTING RANGE - NIGHT 
Abigail sits in her workshop area, restringing one of her bows.  Nearby is a table with an assortment of equipment -- a bow press, vise stand, string jig, bow scales and wrench sets. 
Across the way is a shooting range with a variety of targets set up, a wall of netting behind them to catch stray arrows. There's also a chronograph outfitted with a ballistic computer to measure arrow speed. 
CLOSE ON Abigail's hands as she works with a quiet precsion, re-setting the arrow rest, making minor adjustments to the center-shot position and wheel timing, etc. 
BLADE 
appears in the doorway, watching her. 
BLADE You alright? 
ABIGAIL (brusque) I'll be fine. 
Blade nods.  He's going to leave her alone -- but then he hesitates, wrestling to say something. 
BLADE Don't let it turn inward. 
Abigail takes a deep breath, pausing in her work. 
ABIGAIL It already has.  Since I can remember I've had this knife of sadness in my heart.  As long as it stays there, I'm strong.  I'm untouchable.  But the moment I pull it out -- (turning back to him) -- I'll die. 
Blade nods.  He understands all too well.  He leaves. 
ON ABIGAIL 
She stands, moving to the shooting range.  She straps on a quiver, takes aim at 
A 3-D HUMAN-SHAPED TARGET 
about a hundred feet away.  Just in front of the target is the chronograph, which looks like a miniature set of goal posts. 
WHOOSH!  Abigail FIRES an arrow.  It flies through the arms of the chronograph, sinking into the targets s chest.  On the screen of the ballistic computer, the arrow's speed is clocked at 240 feet per second.  We move CLOSER to her now as-- 
WHOOSH!  Abicail FIRES again. The speed is 242 fps. CLOSER -- 
Abigail selecting arrows, checking the range-dials. 
Blade sliding silver stakes into his bandoliers. 
Abigail working with Caulder, affixing the plague capsule to one of her arrowheads. 
Blade polishes his sword.  Finished, he sights down the length of it, takes a practice swing, then secures it in his back scabbard with a flourish. 
EXT. DEEP-SIX AQUARIUM STOCK - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT 
We hear the RUMBLE of two motorcycles.  Blade emerges from the alley astride his signature Ducati ST2 crotch-rocket.  Abigail appears a moment later on her own customized bike. 
Blade revs his engine.  Then the two bikes take off. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT 
Drake sits before Zoe, who has been shackled to the wall, his 
right arm encased in one of the armored gauntlets from his burial armor.  The rest of the armor has been propped up on a stand nearby. 
DRAKE Do you know who I am? 
ZOE You're the Nome King. 
Drake smiles at this. 
DRAKE The Nome King.  I like that. (leaning closer) Tell me, child.  Do you want to die? 
Zoe is terrified but tries to remain defiant. 
ZOE I'm not afraid -- I'll go to Heaven. 
DRAKE There is no Heaven.  No God.  No angels. No happy ending for good little girls. The only thing you have to look forward to is nothingness. 
As Drake talks his pupils seem to widen -- until the darkness nearly occludes the whites of his eyes.  Zoe stares at him. Can't tear her gaze away.  His eyes are hypnotic. 
DRAKE But what if you could change that?  What if you could remain a child forever? 
He reaches out, running a sharp fingernail over her cheek. 
DRAKE What if you could keep this little doll- like face of yours until the sun itself cooled to a cold, hard rock? (beat) Wouldn't you like that?  Wouldn't you accept that gift? 
Zoe reaches out, calmly touches Drake's cheek. 
ZOE My friends are coming to kill you. 
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT 
WHACK!  Grimwood PUNCHES King, whose body sags, weakened from the beatings he has undergone.  Asher and Danica look on. 
KING -- gonna be sorry you did that -- 
ASHER Nobody's coming for you, King. 
KING Sure they are.  Left a trail of digital bread crumbs -- 
DANICA Excuse me? 
KING One thing you need to know about us Nightstalkers.  When you join our club, you get this nifty little tracking node surgically implanted in your body -- 
GRIMWOOD Bullshit. 
KING Scout's honor.  One of us gets lost, the others just dial up the satellite and presto, instant cavalry. 
Grimwood looks to Asher and Danica, unsure. 
AS HER He's bluffing. 
DANICA (smiling, playing along) Okay, King, where did they put this tracking node of yours? 
He motions for her to draw closer, whispering. 
KING It's in my left ass-cheek -- 
WHACK!  Danica slaps King's face, making him see stars. 
KING Alright.  alright, it's in my right ass- cheek -- 
WHACK!  Danica slaps King again, this time knocking his head the other way.  He spits out blood -- 
Abigail nods, handing King her pistol.  Then she's out the door.  Seconds later, King follows -- 
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAYS - VARIOUS - NIGHT 
Abigail pauses, slipping her earbuds in, turning on her MP3 player.  The bumping-strains of Fluke's Absurd track kick in. Abigail uncilps her UV arc, telescopes it outward and -- 
-- suddenly it's like we're in a first-person shooter video game.  She moves through the corridors with mathematical precision, feeling the MUSIC in her bones, slicing through every vampire she encounters with deadly efficiency. 
VAMPIRES AND HUMAN FAMILIARS 
are coming out from every doorway. 
Abigail PUNCHES one in the solar plexus, DECAPITATES another, finishes off the first.  Then she's moving on, taking down a third, fourth, and fifth vampire with her rapid-fire stake dispenser.  Throwing stakes with blinding speed. 
After a half-dozen stakes, her dispenser is empty.  Without missing a beat, she presses a tab on the dispenser, ejects the clip, then reaches to her belt where a back-up is secured and slaps it in place.  The mayhem continues. 
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT 
Blade unsheathes his sword.  He parries two combatants with clubs, then whirls around, DEFLECTING a GUNSHOT from a third with the flat of his sword. 
Grimwood is furious.  His men are tripping all over themselves.  He grabs an antique battle axe that's secured to the wall.  He sees an opening, SWINGS at Blade's head -- 
-- Blade drops and the axe slices through one of Grimwood's own men. 
In an eye-blink, Blade is up again, advancing.  He cuts down another familiar, pushes forward, cuts oown a second -- 
Now Blade and Grimwood are face to face.  Grimwood swings his axe again.  Blade hooks his sword beneath it, FLIPPING it from Grimwood's hands. 
Blade sweeps his sword around in a wide arc, CUTTING straight through Grimwood's mid-section.  The upper half of Grimwood's body topples away -- 
-- then he rights himself.  A half-vampire.  He's still alive, running forward on his hands, trailing viscera.  He SPRINGS UP at Blade, all claws and gnashing teeth. 
Blade catches Grimwood by the throat, whirls him around -- 
--  and manages to IMPALE what's left of Grimwood with his sword-point.  Grimwood ASHES in Blade's arms.  The only thing left are his steel teeth, which CLATTER to the floor at Blade's feet. 
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT 
Abigail enters, SEES Zoe.  TWO VAMPIRES GUARDS stand nearby. In a flash, Abigail flings TWO SILVER STAKES at them.  Both stakes hit their mark and the vamps crumple to ASH. 
Abigail hurries over, SHOOTS apart the lock on Zoe's shackle. Zoe wraps her arms around Abigail, hugging her tight.  Abigail takes Zoe by the hand, pulling her towards the door. 
ABIGAIL Come on, hon.  Let's get you out of here. 
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
King stumbles out into the hallway, pulling his shirt back on. As he limps down the corridor, a GROWL makes him pause -- 
KING'S POV 
Beau, the vampire rottweiler, lopes around the corner.  Then -- 
TWO MORE ROTTWEILERS 
emerge behind Beau.  They're all GROWLING now. 
KING (under his breath) Fuck.  Me.  Sideways. 
The three of them break, BARKING like crazy, snouts splitting open as their jaws flower apart. 
CUT T0: 
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT 
Blade moves into the upper gallery of a vast atrium. 
DRAKE 
stands before him, waiting, sword in hand.  He extends it, touching the tip to the floor.  A challenge. 
DRAKE Are you ready to die, Blade? 
BLADE Been ready since the day I was born, mother-fucker. 
DRAKE (with a smile) Then allow me to accommodate you. 
Drake does a back-flip over the balcony.  Forty feet down. 
Blade follows, drawing his sword as he LEAPS -- 
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT 
A SERIES OF LIGHTING GANTRIES 
span the length of the atrium ceiling. 
Abigail balances on the handrail, then jumps out into space -- 
-- catching hold of one of the crosspieces.  Like an acrobat, she monkey-swings her way beneath the gantry.  If she loses her grip, she'll fall more than fifty feet. 
BA-BANG!  A bullet strikes just in front of Abigail, showering her with SPARKS.  MORE BULLETS follow. 
ANGLE ON PAIR OF VAMPIRES 
FIRING from below, trying to pick her off.  Suddenly, UV BULLETS strike each of the vampires.  As they ASH we -- 
WHIP-PAN BACK TO KING, 
having dragged his battered body out onto the upper gallery. He's playing guardian angel to Abigail, laying down cover fire so she can continue.  But then -- 
DANICA KING!!! 
DANICA 
appears behind King.  She TACKLES him, wrestling him to the floor, pummeling his face with her fist. 
King tries to ward of f the blows, but he's sorely outmatched. He swings his electronic pistol up -- 
Danica twists it from his grip, ejecting the clip from the stock.  King's sun dog bullets spill out all over the floor. She tosses the gun aside, reaches for King again -- 
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - LIGHTING GANTRY - NIGHT 
Back to Abigail.  She's breathing heavily, trying to call up new reserves of strength.  She glances down -- 
Big mistake. 
She forces herself to look back up.  She swings herself pendulum-style, manages to snag yet another crosspiece.  A SHOT RINGS OUT -- 
ANGLE ON ASHER, 
down below, armed with a rifle.  He FIRES again -- 
-- grazing Abigail's shoulder with the bullet.  Abigail CRIES OUT, nearly losing her grip. 
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT 
King rolls on his side, spits out a bloody tooth. 
KING No offense, Danica -- (gasping in pain) -- but I've wanted to kill you since the moment we slept together. 
DANICA I was that bad, huh? 
King reaches a palsied hand for his discarded pistol, points it vaguely in Danica's direction.  She LAUGHS. 
DANICA No bullets in your gun, King. 
KING Yeah, but here's the beauty -- (wiping his bloody mouth) -- these babies can be triggered remotely. 
King pulls the trigger.  The scattered sun dog bullets ERUPT with UV LIGHT.  Danica SHRIEKS, trying to shield her already burning face from the glare.  She runs, horribly wounded. 
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT 
Drake pummels Blade, flinging his body about like a ragdoll. He grabs Blade by his ankle, swings him upwards some thirty feet -- 
SMASH!  Blade collides with the underside of a massive hanging glass chandelier/lighting fixture. 
Blade FALLS back to the ground, stunned, dropping his sword. Drake pounces on him.  Blade can barely fend off Drake's blows anymore.  In desperation he digs his fingers into Drake's eyes. 
Drake swings both fists downward, Hulk-style, SHATTERING an entire section of the limestone flooring. 
A SHOCK-WAVE ripples out from the point of impact, sending waves of two-foot stone tiles flipping up into the air, knocking Blade off his feet. 
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT 
King loads a sun dog into his pistol, steadies his aim on the railing, and FIRES at Asher -- 
THE SUN DOG 
screams across the atrium, striking dead-center in Asher's open mouth.  The bullet EXPLODES.  UV LIGHT causes Asher's skull to burn up from the inside out.  His headless corpse falls forward over the gallery railing.  Then it too carbonizes and BURNS UP. 
Relieved, King sinks to his knees. 
BEHIND KING, 
as the arrowhead dispense the bio-weapon.  We SEE the virus flooding Drake's internal organs, causing them to blacken as his circulatory system carries it throughout his body. 
ON DRAKE'S FACE, 
letting loose an INHUMAN SCREAM, vomiting up a spray of blood mist.  His monstrous features begin to melt, reshaping into his more familiar face.  At the same time we -- 
GO MACR0 ONCE MORE 
Shrinking until we are amidst the spray of blood Drake expelled.  We continue shrinking until we are moving with the individual molecules of Drake's breath as the plague virions latch onto them, causing them to blacken and become necrotic. Moving with the twirling molecules until they are inhaled by -- 
DANICA, 
having retreated from her defeat by King.  She clutches her throat.  We can see the virus infiltrating her system as tiny BLACK THREADS expand across her face.  She sways, falling onto the floor.  She reaches a beseeching hand towards King -- 
-- then dies, a final still-born curse on her lips. 
MORE VAMPIRES 
are feeling the effects now too.  One by one they drop, choking, going into convulsions.  As they writhe on the floor, we watch the Daystar virus ravaging their bodies. 
BACK TO BLADE AND DRAKE 
Drake slumps against the wall.  Hero and villain are now separated by only a few feet.  Both at death's door. 
DRAKE Well done, hunter.  Well done. 
Blade stares back.  At this point, he's just trying to remain conscious.  He's lost a ton of blood. 
DRAKE You fought with honor -- 
Drake shudders, his breathing becoming increasingly shallow. 
DRAKE -- as I knew you would.  The humans are coming for you, you know.  In their eyes, you and I are the same. Allow me one last indulgence, then -- (gasping) -- a parting gift -- 
Drake grows still, his eyes locked on Blade's. 
ABIGAIL AND KING 
rush to Blade's side.  Zoe joins them.  Blade is dying, fading fast.  Abigail shakes Blade -- 
ABIGAIL 
Blade! 
Her voice sounds distant and muted, overridden by Blade's own HEARTBEAT which is fading up, dominating the soundtrack. 
ABIGAIL BLADE!!! 
Blade's eyes can't focus anymore.  They're clouding over. 
BLADE'S POV We drop away from Abigail and King -- like we're falling down 
a dark tunnel.	 Then the world FADES TO WHITE. 
EXT. CITYSCAPE	- DAWN 
FADE IN FROM WHITE.  We see the sky, the burning orb of the rising sun.  A trio of FBI helicopters ride out from the dawn, swooping down over the stirring city. 
ABIGAIL (V.0.) It didn't take long for the authorities to arrive. 
INT. LEAD HELICOPTER - DAWN 
Cumberland sits in the front passenger seat, Hale behind him. 
EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PLAZA - DAWN 
As the helicopters touch down in the plaza we see a small convoy of POLICE and FBI VEHICLES converging around them. 
Cumberland and Hale are among the first out.  They rush towards the Phoenix Towers entrance, guns drawn, DOZENS OF AGENTS and OFFICERS behind them. 
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - DAWN 
The first rays of sun penetrate through the atrium windows setting the scattered vampire corpses ablaze.  Danica, Asher, and the others all ignite. 
ABIGAIL (V.0.) When they got there, all of Drake's people were dead. 
By the time Cumberland and his men have entered, fanning out through the atrium, all they find are a series of corpse shaped piles of ash and singe marks. 
ABIGAIL (V.0.) In the weeks that followed, the rest of the world's vampires also perished. (beat) We'd finally won. 
ON CUMBERLAND,

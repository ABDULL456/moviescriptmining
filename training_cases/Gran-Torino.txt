GRAN TORINO 
Written by 
Nick Schenk 
FADE IN: 
INT. CHURCH 
We're at the funeral of Dorothy Kowalski. In attendance are mostly old folks, their offspring and several bored teenagers. WALT KOWALSKI stands towards the front of the church. He speaks to an older MAN in a bulky, out-of-date suit. 
OLDER MAN I'm real sorry about Dorothy, Walt. She was a real peach. 
WALT Thanks for coming, Al. Walt Kowalski looks young for his age. He has slate blue eyes, physically fit and has had the same buzz cut hairstyle since getting out of the military in 1953. Walt is also a perfectionist. Nothing escapes his hawklike eyes, eyes that pierce and judge. Walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at his wife's funeral. His eyes narrow at his GRANDDAUGHTER's belly button ring. 
WALT Jesus Christ. Walt's two sons, MITCH and STEVE, watch their father from across the pews. 
MITCH Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley. He can't even tone it down at Mom's funeral? 
STEVE What do you expect? Dad's still living in the 50s. He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly. 
MITCH Yeah, well your kid's wearing a Timberwolves jersey. I'm sure Dad appreciates that. 
STEVE My point is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the Old Man.

PAGE 3 It's inevitable. That's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings; the deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath, it's always something. 
MITCH What are we going to do with him? Don't you think he'll get in trouble by himself over in the old neighborhood? 
STEVE Why don't you have him move in with you? 
MITCH Ha ha. 
INT. CHURCH - LATER 
The choir sings the Beatitudes. Walt looks around disgustedly at the people gathered as one woman looks through her day planner, an old guy dozes and his Granddaughter Ashley applies nail polish. FATHER JANOVICH, the very young parish priest, steps up to the altar and delivers the eulogy for Walt's wife. Walt sits ramrod straight and listens to the thin, weak, unconvincing words of Father Janovich. 
FATHER JANOVICH Death... is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics. Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased ... and their families. Sweet to those who know the salvation that awaits them. And some may ask, what is death. Is it the end? Or is it the beginning? And what is life? What is this thing we call life? 
WALT Jesus. Walt coughs. He takes a handkerchief and wipes his lips. He looks down and notices a speck of BLOOD on the white cloth. 
CONTINUED: 
INT. WALT'S HOUSE - SAME TIME 
The house is crammed with people following the service. Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He has to keep busy. Steve steps over to his father. 
STEVE A lot of people showed up after the service. 
WALT Yeah, well, I s'pose they knew there'd be plenty of ham. I think I'll go downstairs and get some more chairs. 
STEVE I'll do it, Dad. 
WALT Naw, we need them now, not next week. 
INT. CELLAR - SAME TIME 
Grandsons JOSH, DANIEL and DAVID look through boxes in the cellar. A box of old Korea War photos are pawed through. 
Josh holds up a black-and-white PHOTO -- a young WALT looks utterly exhausted, behind him six bodies are sprawled dead on the ground. 
DAVID Is that Dad? 
DANIEL No, it's Grandpa Walt. Josh turns the photo over and reads it... 
JOSH Third Platoon, E company, March second, 1952, Korea.' 
DANIEL Where's Korea? 
JOSH Hell if I know? David holds up a MEDAL. 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 5 
DAVID Cool, I found a medal. They hear someone coming downstairs. By the time Walt descends the staircase, the boys sit on the couch, pretending to be doing nothing. Walt gives them a hard look as he grabs some chairs. 
FATHER JANOVICH No, I do. 
WALT The problem is I think you're an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who holds the hands of superstitious old women and promises them eternity.

PAGE 15 Walt shuts the front door in Father Janovich's face. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Tao walks down the street, his head in a book. He finally realizes there's a blue Chevy following slowly behind him. The blue Chevy is now parallel with Tao and keeps pace with his step. Tao looks over to the occupants of the Chevy. It's two LATINOS. Tao quickens his pace, but the Chevy easily keeps up with Tao. 
LATINO DRIVER Is you a boy or a girl, I can't tell? 
LATINO #2 What you reading, gook, Jackass And The Rice Stalk? Tao laughs, but keeps walking. 
LATINO DRIVER That's right, you keep walking. Fucking slopes everywhere you look, man. Why gooks come up in here and fuck up our neighborhood? Down the street -- is a suped-up HONDA CIVIC with a big SPOILER on the back. Inside are five Hmong gangbangers. The Hmong gangbangers notice Tao being followed by the Latinos. SPIDER, the driver, squints and then points at Tao. 
SPIDER Dude, that's my little cousin, Tao. 
SMOKIE You sure about that, Spider? 
SPIDER I'm sure. Do we do something... or what? Smokie is the gang leader. He looks at Tao for a second. 
SMOKIE Your cousin tight with anyone? 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 16 
SPIDER No, he flies solo, Smokie. 
SMOKIE Okay. Let's go help out our little cousin. Smokie nods to Spider, they roar up and stop right across from Tao and the Latinos' car. 
SMOKIE You better not be giving my bro here a hard time or you're gonna wish you never been born. 
LATINO DRIVER Oh goody, more Rice Niggers. The Latino Driver smiles and flashes a PISTOL. A Hmong kid in the back seat opens the door and displays a sub-machine gun. The Latinos are way out-gunned. 
LATINO #2 Fucking Viet Cong swamp rats. Go back to your fucking rice paddy. The Latinos screech their tires and are gone. The Hmongs in the car smile and congratulate themselves. Tao simply keeps walking down the street! 
SMOKIE Where the fuck does he think he's going? Turn us around and go after that cousin of yours. They swing a U-turn and pull up to Tao, keeping pace with him as he walks. 
SPIDER Hey, cuz, slow down, where you going? You should really think about hanging with us, man. If we all stick together, shit like that won't happen, with those Spicks. Tao nods as he walks, but doesn't answer. 
SPIDER You can't be such a little girl. You join up with us, we'll keep you out of trouble, cuz. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 17 Tao looks at the sub-machine gun cradled by the Hmong gangbanger in the back seat. Smokie takes this all in. He looks down the street and sees that in a half block, Tao will have to pass a group of Latino gangbanger types. 
SMOKIE You think about it and we'll see you tomorrow. 
EXT. TAO'S HOUSE - DAY 
Tao digs in the garden. Tao's younger sister SUE sits and reads JANE magazine on the porch. The tricked-out Honda with Blue Neon lights pulls up. Spider, Smokie and two other Hmong gangbangers get out. 
SPIDER Hey, cuz. Hey, Sue. 
SUE What do you want? 
SPIDER Came to talk to my cousin Tao. Smokie looks over to Sue. 
SMOKIE Spider, who's the other cousin? SUE laughs at the name Spider. Sue is seventeen, has long straight hair with red highlights. 
SUE Spider'? Is that what he just called you, Fong? 
SPIDER This is my little cousin, Sue. Smokie takes off his sunglasses and smiles at Sue. 
SMOKIE Hey, Sue... how old are you, girl? 
SUE Mentally, I'm way too old for you. I'm going inside.

FATHER JANOVICH Ummmm... I'll have a gin and tonic. 
WALT Attaboy. The waitress leaves. 
WALT So, what do you want? 
FATHER JANOVICH I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession. 
WALT Jesus Christ, why'd you do that? 
FATHER JANOVICH She was very insistent. She made me. 
WALT You sure are fond of promising people stuff you can't deliver on. 
FATHER JANOVICH Let's talk about something else. 
WALT Like what? 
FATHER JANOVICH Life and death. 
WALT What would you know about it? 
FATHER JANOVICH I'd like to think I know a lot. I'm a priest. 
WALT You stand at the altar and preach on and on about life and death without knowing anything other than what you learned in priest school. Everything you say sounds like it's out of the Rookie Preachers Handbook. 
FATHER JANOVICH I don't know about that... 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 22 Walt waves his hand and cuts him off. 
WALT Death is bittersweet? Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation.' That's what you know of life and death? Good God, it's pathetic. 
FATHER JANOVICH What do you know, Mr. Kowalski? 
WALT Plenty. I lived with death for three years in Korea. We shot people, we stabbed them with bayonets, we hacked seventeen-year- old kids to death with shovels, for Christ's sake. I did things that won't leave me till the day I die, horrible things, things I have to live with. 
FATHER JANOVICH And what about life? Walt has to think for a second. He struggles with his answer. 
WALT Well... I survived the war... got married... and raised a family. 
FATHER JANOVICH Sounds like you know more about death than you do living. Walt downs a shot. 
WALT Maybe so. 
INT. WALT'S BEDROOM - THAT SAME NIGHT 
Walt hears a sound and wakes up. He's very groggy, he had plenty to drink at the VFW. 
WALT Daisy? The dog sleeps in her bed in the corner. Walt looks at the clock; it's 3:48 am. Walt looks out his bedroom window. He sees the faint beam of a flashlight in his garage. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 23 
WALT Son of a bitch. Walt pulls on his robe, opens the closet and pulls out the big, 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle he took home from Korea. Walt slides a magazine into the top of the M1 and chambers a round with a loud SNAP. 
INT. GARAGE - SECONDS LATER 
The light flips on and before he can blink, Tao is face to face with the barrel of Walt's M1 RIFLE. Walt is silent, he has one eye closed so he can better aim at Tao's forehead -- which is nine inches away. Tao drops the tool he was holding, it bounces with a loud metallic clang. Tao backs away, his eyes wide with terror. As Tao backs up, Walt advances, step for step. Tao trips over a garden hose, which causes Walt to trip. They both start to fall. The lightbulb is bumped with the rifle barrel and swings back and forth. As Walt hits the garage floor, he accidentally FIRES THE RIFLE. The bullet goes through a big, metal Hamm's Beer sign on the wall. Tao scrambles to his feet and jumps like a deer over Walt. Tao runs out of the garage and into the night. Walt lies on the floor for a second, stunned. Sweat runs down his forehead. He coughs up blood. The lightbulb still swings, casting odd shadows in the garage. 
WALT Shit. 
EXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME 
Tao scrambles down the alley. Parked off to the side is Spider's Honda. Spider opens the door. 
SPIDER Get in, get in! Tao runs right past him. Spider guns the motor and pulls in front of Tao. Smokie, Spider and another gangbanger get out. 
CONTINUED: 
TAO I'm sorry. 
WALT For what? 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 33 
TAO For trying to steal your car. Walt's eyes go wide in recognition. He turns white with rage. 
WALT Get this straight, I see you on my property again, you're done. Walt turns on his heels and storms into his house. 
INT. WALT'S ENTRYWAY 
The doorbell rings. Walt opens it to find Father Janovich standing on his front step. 
FATHER JANOVICH Good afternoon, Walt. Walt's eyes narrow. 
FATHER JANOVICH I mean, Mr. Kowalski. 
WALT I already told you I'm not going to confession. 
FATHER JANOVICH Why didn't you just call the police? 
WALT Pardon? 
FATHER JANOVICH I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood. Why didn't you call the police? 
WALT Oh, I prayed for them to show up, but guess what? No answer. 
FATHER JANOVICH What were you thinking? Someone could have been killed. We're talking life and death here. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 34 
WALT Not that it's any of your goddamned business, but when things happen quickly like that, you have to react. In Korea, we never called the police' when a swarm of screaming gooks came pouring into our lines. We reacted. 
FATHER JANOVICH We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski. Walt says nothing. 
FATHER JANOVICH I've been thinking about our discussion on life and death. About what you said. About how you carry around the horrible things you were forced to do. Horrible things that won't leave you. It seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden. Things done during war are terrible, being ordered to kill, killing to save others, killing to save yourself. You're right, those are things I don't know anything about. But I do know about forgiveness. And I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins, admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them. Stronger men than you. Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace. Walt nods. Father Janovich threw a bull's-eye. Almost. 
WALT I'm impressed. You came with your guns loaded, for once. 
FATHER JANOVICH Thank you. 
WALT You have balls, Father. And what you said, you're right. I'm sure stronger men than me have found their salvation. Hallelujah. But there's one thing you're way wrong about. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 35 
FATHER JANOVICH What's that, Mr. Kowalski? 
WALT The thing that haunts a guy is the stuff he wasn't ordered to do. 
INT. OLD SCHOOL BARBERSHOP 
The old, balding BARBER finishes cutting Walt's hair. 
BARBER There, you look like a human being again. You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap bastard. 
WALT I'm just amazed that you're still alive. I keep hoping you'll die and they'll get someone good in here, but you just hang in there, you dumb, Italian-Wop-Dago, you. 
BARBER That'll be ten dollars, Walt. 
WALT Ten dollars? Jesus Christ, Martin, you keep raising the price. You sure you're not part Jew? Martin the Barber laughs at Walt. 
BARBER It's been ten bucks for the last five years and you know it, you thick-skulled, old Pollack son of a bitch. 
WALT Here's ten, keep the change. 
BARBER See you in three weeks, you prick. 
WALT If you live that long, dipshit. Walt and Martin shake hands and Walt walks out. 
TALL BLACK GUY You are fucking crazy. 
WALT You have to be pretty goddamned dumb to think you can push people around without running into someone who will push back. The black guys are a bit dumbfounded. Walt stares them down. 
WALT But you might just be dumb enough not to recognize that your luck just ran out. All bravado drains away from the black guys. Walt is a rock. Walt grins slightly and spits on the ground. 
TALL BLACK GUY Fuck this guy. He ain't worth it. The trio walks slowly across the street, forcing a car to miss a green light. Trey puts his hand out to shake Walt's... 
TREY Man, thanks a lot, mister. Walt doesn't extend a hand, he lets Trey stand there like an idiot. Trey slowly lowers his arm. Walt looks at Trey's outfit. 
WALT Go home, clown... and pull up your goddamned pants. Walt turns to Sue. 
WALT Come on, I'll give you a ride.

PAGE 40 
INT. WALT'S TRUCK - DRIVING 
Walt and Sue drive in silence. Finally Sue speaks up. 
SUE So, what's with you, you have some sort of savior complex or something? 
WALT What in the hell's the matter with you? I thought all you Asian girls were supposed to be so smart. What are you doing walking around in that neighborhood? That's how you end up in the obituaries, that is, if they can identify your body once they pull it out of the goddamned river. 
SUE I know, I know. Take it easy. Walt looks at her for a second. She's not ruffled at all. They drive. 
WALT So, that goofball back there. He's your boyfriend? 
SUE Yeah, kind of, his name is Trey. 
WALT Why in the hell would you go out with a clown like that. Why don't you date one of your... own...one of those other... Hu-mungs. 
SUE You mean, Hmong? We're Hmong, not Hu-mung. 
WALT Right. Hmong. What is a... where is Hmong or whatever? Sue laughs. 
SUE Wow! You're so enlightened. Hmong isn't a place, it's a people. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 41 Hmong people come from different parts of Laos and Thailand and China. 
WALT Then why are you in my neighborhood, instead of back there? 
SUE It's a Vietnam thing. We fought on your side and when America quit, the Communists starting killing the Hmong, so we came over here. Walt is quiet for few seconds. 
WALT Why'd you pick the Midwest, for Christ's sake? There's snow on the ground near half the year. Jungle people on the frozen tundra? 
SUE Hill people. We were hill people, not jungle people. Boo-ga, boo- ga, boo-ga. 
WALT Whatever. 
SUE Blame the Lutherans. They brought us here. 
WALT Still, you'd think the cold would keep all the assholes away. Sue laughs again at Walt's conscienceless racism. 
SUE Thanks for the ride. 
WALT Sure... You know, you seem okay. What the hell's the matter with your half-wit brother? He a little slow or something?

SUE (CONT'D)

PAGE 42 
SUE Tao is actually really bright, he just doesn't know which direction to go in. 
WALT Oh, poor Toad. 
SUE It's really common. Hmong girls over here fit in better, we adjust. The girls go to college, the boys go to jail. 
EXT. WALT'S FRONT PORCH - EARLY MORNING 
Walt drinks coffee and reads the newspaper. He flips from section to section. Daisy's at his feet. Next door, Phong sits watching Walt. He can see her mumbling under her breath. 
MITCH To hell with him, kicking us out on his birthday?! We should've stayed home with Ashley and Josh. They knew better, they wouldn't even come. The goddamned kids are smarter than we are! Mitch screeches the tires as they take off. Walt waits for them to clear out, before coming out on the porch with a can of Pabst. Daisy comes out and lies at his feet. Walt covers his mouth as he coughs. A dime-sized circle of dark, red blood is left in the palm of his hand. Walt looks at the blood as he takes another sip of beer. 
EXT. WALT'S PORCH - EVENING 
Walt continues to sit on his porch, a long row of empty Pabst beer cans are lined up on the railing. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 46 Walt looks at a photo in his wallet, his and Dorothy's wedding photo. Walt looks down at Daisy -- 
WALT We miss Momma, don't we, Daisy. A vehicle pulls up to Tao's house. A party is in full swing. Sue comes out and helps the Hmong women unload big platters of food and carry them to the house. Sue catches Walt's gaze and steps over to his porch. 
SUE Hey, Walt, what are you up to? Walt points his index finger at the can of Pabst in his hand. 
SUE We're having a barbecue. You want to come over? 
WALT What do you think? 
SUE There's tons of food. 
WALT I'll bet. Just keep your paws off my dog. 
SUE No worries, we only eat cats. 
WALT Really? 
SUE No, I'm kidding, you moron. Come on, come on over. You can be my special guest. 
WALT I'm fine right here. Walt reaches into the cooler for another beer. It's empty, just water and ice. 
WALT Son of a bitch. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 47 
SUE What have you had to eat today, Walt? 
WALT A piece of cake and some beef jerky. 
SUE Come on over and get something to eat. We've got beer, too. Walt exhales loudly -- 
WALT Oh, what the hell. It's my birthday, I may as well drink with strangers instead of myself. Walt gets up and walks with Sue towards her house. 
SUE Happy Birthday, Wally. 
WALT Don't call me Wally. 
INT. TAO'S HOUSE - KITCHEN 
Inside are thirty Hmong and Walt, who sticks out like a sore thumb. Total fish out of water. Walt looks in the refrigerator, Sue looks over his shoulder. 
WALT You do have a lot of beer, but no Pabst. 
SUE As they say, When in Hmong. 
WALT Ha ha. Are you sure it's okay I'm here? Everyone keeps looking at me and when I look back, they look at the ground. 
SUE It's fine. Phong appears from the crowd and points at Walt.

PHONG 
(SUBTITLED) You, get out. Out of our house! (to Sue) What is he doing here? Walt cringes at her presence. 
WALT What'd she say? 
SUE She said welcome to our home. 
WALT No she didn't. 
SUE No, she didn't. 
SUE Are you okay? Walt brushes past her and goes into the bathroom. 
INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME 
EPIPHANY. Walt washes his face in the sink and dries his hands. He's still pale. He looks long and hard in the mirror. Walt is stunned, it all adds up. Walt hasn't really lived in 50 years, he hasn't relaxed or exhaled or let his guard down since he got back from Korea in 1953. 
WALT (to himself) Son of a bitch. I've got more in common with these goddamned gooks than my own spoiled-rotten family.

SUE (CONT'D) 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 52 Walt looks at himself. 
WALT Happy birthday. Walt opens the bathroom door. Sue stands there with a concerned look on her face. 
SUE Are you okay? 
WALT Me? I'm fine. 
SUE You were bleeding? Walt smiles disarmingly. 
WALT I just bit my tongue. I'm fine. I'm great. Let's get some of that gook food, I'm starving. 
INT. KITCHEN 
Walt sits amongst several old Hmong Women, who take great delight in feeding him different Hmong dishes which he's obviously never tasted before. Walt reacts with great enthusiasm to the food, occasionally making jokes like he's choking, etc. This corny stuff goes over like gangbusters with the Hmong ladies. Sue comes in and rolls her eyes at Walt. 
SUE Come on, you glutton, let's go downstairs. 
WALT Why? 
SUE To mingle. 
WALT I'm fine right here. I'm mingling. 
SUE Come on, you said not to leave you alone.' 
CONTINUED: 
PAGE 53 
INT. BASEMENT - SAME TIME 
Walt and Sue descend the stairway. Walt is really out of his element down with all the Hmong teenagers. And the first person he sees across the room is Tao. 
WALT Oh great. 
SUE Well, look who's over there. 
WALT What's-his-name who tried to steal my Gran Torino. 
SUE My brother Tao. 
WALT Yeah, Toad. Tao is in the corner, he avoids Walt's gaze. Sue walks over to a group of boys, leaving Walt alone. Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He leans against the DRYER. The DRYER wobbles. Walt gets on his hands and knees. He looks under the dryer. He adjusts the short leg to balance out the machine. He just can't help it. All the Hmong kids watch Walt, trying not to laugh at this strange white man on his hands and knees fixing a dryer during a party. Walt looks up -- deer in the headlights. 
WALT It was wobbly, but I fixed it. It's fine now, shouldn't wobble anymore. The Hmong kids look away, covering their mouths with their hands. Walt glares at Tao, who immediately wipes the smile from his face. Sue walks over and hands Walt a drink. 
WALT What's this? 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 54 
SUE Rice liquor. Try it. 
WALT Alright. Sue walks off. Walt sips his rice liquor and watches the interaction between the boys and girls. One particularly gorgeous young willow-wisp of a GIRL stares across the room at Tao. Tao looks back at her, but then looks away. The Girl keeps looking at Tao, smiling and twisting her hair. Tao doesn't approach her, but three other young men do. They do their best to charm her. She's polite, but not interested, she keeps looking at Tao. Walt laughs at Tao's ineptitude, shakes his head at this wasted opportunity. Suddenly the Girl steps over to Walt. She smiles -- 
WA XAM (GIRL) My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here? 
WALT Good question. What am I doing here? Anyways, I'm Walt. 
WA XAM Hi, Walt. I'm Wa Xam. 
WALT Wa Yum? 
WA XAM No, Wa Xam. So... what do you do? 
WALT Me? Not too much... I fix stuff I guess. 
WALT No. Forget it. Stop bringing me stuff. Gee scolds Walt in Hmong. 
WALT No. I've had it. Gee opens the corner of the tinfoil. Walt looks at the food. 
CONTINUED: (4) 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 58 
WALT I can't. You have to stop. Gee pulls the tinfoil off. Walt gazes at the food. 
WALT Is that the chicken dumpling thing you brought the other day? 
EXT. WALT'S HOUSE - EVENING 
Walt pulls up in his pickup truck. Sue and Vu wait on Walt's porch. Tao stands out on the sidewalk. Walt gets out of his pickup. 
WALT What now? What? Vu rambles on in Hmong. Walt looks at his watch. He looks at Sue for the translation. 
SUE Tao is here to make amends, he's here to work for you. 
WALT No he's not. 
SUE Mother says that Tao dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt. He'll start tomorrow morning. 
WALT No. The kid is useless, I don't even want him on my property. I thought we already went over that. 
SUE It's very important to my mother that you accept. It'd be an insult to refuse. 
WALT How is this all of a sudden turned around on me? The goddamned kid tries to steal my car and somehow I'm the bad guy if I don't accept? 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 59 
SUE My family is very traditional and it will very much upset them if you don't let Tao repay... Tao interrupts from the sidewalk... 
TAO Come on, Sue. If he doesn't want to, let's just go. Sue and Vu yell at Tao to shut up at the same time; Sue in English, Vu in Hmong. 
SUE/VU Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!! Tao looks at the ground. A PAUSE. Walt sees the earnest looks on the Hmong women's faces. Their expression begs Walt. Walt gazes back at Tao. Walt looks disgusted, he exhales loudly... 
WALT Fine. Great. Tomorrow. Walt walks past them and into his house. 
WALT Jesus, Joseph and Mary. These Hmong broads are like badgers. 
EXT. WALT'S PORCH - NEXT MORNING 
Walt sits drinking coffee and reading the newspaper. Tao walks sheepishly over to the property line. 
WALT Son of a bitch, I didn't think he'd show. Walt waves Tao over. Tao barely looks at Walt. 
WALT Okay. What are you good at? 
TAO Like what? 
WALT That's what I'm asking. What are you good at?

PAGE 60 If you're gonna work for me, I have to know what you can do. 
TAO I don't know. 
WALT That's about what I expected. Okay, why don't you go over by the spruce tree and count how many birds feed at the bird feeder. 
TAO Count the birds? 
WALT Yeah, you can count? You slopes are supposed to be good at math, right? 
TAO Yes, I can count. 
EXT. WALT'S GARDEN - MORNING 
Tao stands in Walt's garden with his arms folded. Walt walks over to trim weeds around the garden fence. Walt doesn't even look at Tao. Finally... 
GRANDSON Grandpa says he want to know if you can have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch? Walt reaches in his pocket and studies a small note pad. 
WALT I don't see why not. 
(GRINS ) Tell him sometime after lunch. 
EXT. WALT'S HOUSE - MORNING 
Tao walks up the sidewalk. Before ringing the doorbell, Tao looks down at his hands which have several CALLOUSES on them. Tao rubs his hands with a smile. This has been the first time Tao has really risen to a task presented to him. Tao reaches for the doorbell... 
INT. WALT'S BATHROOM - SAME TIME 
Walt stands over the sink, coughing. In the b.g. the doorbell rings. Walt coughs up a big spot of blood, it's thick with fibers. The doorbell rings again. Walt wipes his mouth and runs the water in the sink. 
INT. WALT'S ENTRYWAY - SECONDS LATER 
Walt answers the door, just as Tao rings the doorbell a third time. Walt looks angry. 
WALT Jesus Lord almighty, knock it off. 
TAO It's my last day, whatta you want me to do? 
WALT Take the day off, you've done enough. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 64 Tao looks disappointed, but says nothing. He nods and starts to walk away. Walt calls after him... 
WALT Toad. Tao turns around. Walt wants to say something, but stops. 
WALT Nothing, never mind. Walt shuts the door. 
INT. DOCTOR'S WAITING ROOM 
Walt sits in the crowded waiting room. He looks around. He's the only WHITE PERSON in the room. Even most of the STAFF is African or from India. As Walt waits, names are called out such as Alvarez, Ngaima, Yang and Abdalla. Finally when the name Kowalski is called, the Muslim woman can't pronounce it correctly. Walt winces. 
INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE 
Walt sits in a chair, his hands folded in his lap. A short Asian man in a doctor's smock comes in with a chart. 
ASIAN DOCTOR Mr. Kowalski? 
WALT That's right. 
ASIAN DOCTOR Good afternoon. I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start on a full battery of tests. I feel that this... 
WALT Wait a minute. Where's my regular doctor, where's Dr. Fellman?

INT. MITCH'S KITCHEN 
Mitch, Karen and Ashley are in the kitchen. The phone rings and Ashley looks at the caller ID. 
ASHLEY It's Grandpa Walt. 
KAREN Well, pick it up. 
ASHLEY You talk to him. 
KAREN Mitch? 
MITCH I'm doing bills here. 
KAREN He's your father. Ashley hands him the phone and he pushes the TALK button. 
MITCH Hello, Dad. 
WALT (V.O.) Hello? It's me... Dad. 
MITCH I know. What's up? The CAMERA INTERCUTS BETWEEN Mitch in his huge kitchen and Walt sitting on the edge of his bed.

INT. TAO'S KITCHEN - A MINUTE LATER 
Tao looks on as Walt turns the faucet on and off, it drips water at its base. Walt looks under the sink. 
WALT For the love of Pete. 
TAO What? 
WALT It must be a hundred degrees in here, turn on the fan. Tao flips the switch on the CEILING FAN, the fan wobbles and shakes, it looks like it's about to fly off. Walt stares up at the fan and shakes his head. 
INT. WALT'S GARAGE 
The CEILING FAN and FAUCET are taken apart on the workbench. Walt reinstalls the diverter valve. Tao looks at all of Walt's tools. 
TAO Man, where did you get all this stuff? 
WALT What are you talking about? 
TAO All the tools and stuff. 
WALT Where the hell do you think I got them, Toad? This may come as a shock to a thief, but I actually bought the things I have with money I earned. 
TAO Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not what I meant. There's just so much shit packed in here. 
WALT You need the right tool for the right job. Every single thing here has a purpose. 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 70 
TAO Okay, what's this? Tao points to a tool. 
WALT Post hole digger. Tao starts pointing at things on the workbench in quick succession, questioning Walt with his expression. 
WALT Hand spade. Tin snips. Nail punch. Tack hammer. Putty knife. Wire stripper. Drywall saw. Tile spacers. Silence. Walt can see something is bothering Tao, but he's too uncomfortable to speak up -- 
WALT What? 
TAO I can't afford to buy all this stuff. 
WALT I didn't buy all this stuff at once, blockhead. I've lived here for fifty years. A man stays in one place long enough he tends to attract a decent set of tools. 
TAO Yeah, but... 
WALT Look, kid, I think I know where you're going with this. You don't need everything to maintain a house. I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Walt rattles around his tool bench and slaps down THREE items in quick succession. 
WALT This is for you. Roll of duct tape, can of WD-40 and a pair of vise-grips. Any man who's worth a shit can do half his household jobs with these three things. In the odd chance that doesn't work out, you can borrow something. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 71 
TAO Okay. Cool. Walt coughs and covers his mouth. Both Tao and Walt see the spot of BLOOD in his hand. 
TAO What's with that? 
WALT What's with what? 
TAO The blood you just coughed up. That's not good, you should see a doctor. Walt quickly changes the subject -- while tightening the screws that hold the fan blade to the motor hub. 
WALT So... what exactly was the deal with those guys out on my lawn that night? Who are they? 
TAO A gang. Hmong gangbangers. 
WALT I gathered that. What did they want with you? 
TAO They wanted to take me away because I blew my first initiation. 
WALT You joined up with those pukes? Damn, you are a pussy. Why in the hell did you do that? 
TAO I don't know. They were persuasive. My cousin's in the gang. They just talked me into it I guess. 
WALT Well, at least you're honest about it. A LONG SILENCE. Walt finishes fixing the ceiling fan. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MITCH Why don't you call Stevie? 
WALT Your brother lives out of state. 
MITCH Well, I don't know what to tell you, I'm on my way out. Keys in my hand. 
WALT Okay then. 
MITCH If you can't find anyone by next week, give me a call. Walt nods and hangs up. Mitch hangs up and takes a sip of beer.

MITCH Aunt Mary. Like she needs a freezer. 
INT. TAO'S HOUSE 
The doorbell rings and Tao opens the door. There stands Walt. Tao is a little shocked. 
WALT You got a minute, Toad? 
CUT TO: 
INT. WALT'S BASEMENT - A MINUTE LATER 
Walt and Tao look at the freezer strapped to the dolly. 
WALT I just need a little push. All the weight is up top, so you stay down and give me a little shove at each step. 
TAO Let me take the top. 
WALT Naw, I got it. 
TAO No really, I'll take the top. It looks pretty heavy. 
WALT I'm not crippled. I got it. 
TAO If you don't let me take the top, I ain't helping. I'll go home. 
WALT Listen, zipper head, now's not the time to go and... 
TAO You listen, old man. You came and got me because you needed help, so let me help you. Either it's top or I'm out of here. Walt studies Tao for a second. Tao doesn't blink, he holds his ground. Walt nods, trying not to grin. 
CONTINUED: (3) 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 76 
WALT Okay then, be my guest. Just don't let it slip out of your little girl hands and crush me. Tao laughs. 
TAO Don't give me any ideas. 
EXT. WALT'S BACKYARD - MINUTES LATER 
Tao and Walt ease the freezer down the back steps and pause to take a break. They both breathe hard. 
TAO That thing weighs a ton. 
WALT Yeah, but it runs like new. They don't make them like that anymore. 
TAO What are you going to do with it? 
WALT Sell it. I haven't used it in years and it was always in the way down there. 
TAO How much? 
WALT Oh, I don't know. Sixty bucks, maybe. Why, you need a freezer? 
TAO 
(NODS) Our downstairs one died. Walt thinks for a second. 
WALT Twenty-five and it's yours. 
TAO Twenty-five? You just said sixty? 
WALT Save me from wasting money on putting an ad in the paper. 
TAO You know, the Hmong consider gardening to be women's work. 
WALT Is that why I see you out in your garden all the time? Besides, zipper head, we ain't in Hu-Mong. 
TAO Funny. Walt lights a cigarette. 
TAO You should quit those. It's bad for you. 
WALT So is joining a gang, you dipshit. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
SUE (CONT'D) 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 80 
TAO Seriously, you should quit, I saw you cough up blood. 
WALT So, you ever think about what you want to do with your life? 
TAO I don't know. 
WALT You've never thought about it? 
TAO Of course I have. 
WALT Well, while you're thinking about it, try not to stomp all over my chives, you dipshit. Tao looks down; sure enough, he's standing on Walt's chives. 
TAO Sorry. 
WALT Put some mulch around the cucumbers. Tao spreads more mulch. 
TAO I was thinking about sales, maybe. 
WALT My oldest son's a salesman. He sells cars. 
TAO Does he do well? 
WALT License to steal. I worked in a Ford plant for thirty years and my son sells goddamned Japanese cars. 
TAO You made cars? 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 81 
WALT That's right. And I put the steering column in the Gran Torino when it rolled down the line in 
TAO Wow, that's cool. 
WALT It is, isn't it? 
TAO Does your son come over much? 
WALT How are you going about getting into sales? You thinking about school? 
TAO Kinda. 
WALT Well, you should. 
TAO School costs money. 
WALT Maybe you should get a job and save instead of spreading mulch in my garden. 
TAO Maybe you could just pay me. 
WALT That's funny. 
TAO What kind of job could I get? 
WALT Good question. Who the hell would hire you? 
TAO 
(DEFLATED) Yeah, I know. 
WALT Aw, go on. I'm kidding. You could get a job, easy. 
BARBER Kid, you shoulda just started with Hi' or Hello.' 
WALT Right. You should have said, Excuse me, I'm looking for a haircut if you have time.' 
BARBER Yeah. Be polite, but don't kiss ass. 
WALT Or, even better is act like you just got off a construction job. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 85 Or bitch about your girlfriend or getting your car fixed. 
BARBER Right. Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes fixed and those sons a bitches really nailed me. Screwed me right in the ass. 
WALT Exactly. Don't swear at the guy you're talking to, swear about another guy who ain't there. My son of a bitch prick fucking boss made me work overtime and he knew I had bowling tonight. 
BARBER Or, my old lady bitches to me for two fucking hours about how they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store and the minute I turn on the goddamned game, she starts crying how we never talk. 
WALT See? You come back in, Toad. Be polite and then you bring up something you can both talk about. It ain't rocket science. 
TAO Yeah, but I don't have a job or a car or a girlfriend. Walt and the Barber laugh. 
BARBER Sweet Jesus, I shoulda blown his head off when I had the chance. 
WALT Just go back outside and try it again. And don't mention you're a pussy with no car, girl, job, future or whatever. Come in and act like a man, Toad. Tao goes out, turns around and comes back in. 
TAO Excuse me, sir, I need a haircut, if you ain't too busy... you Italian son-of-a-bitch prick barber. 
CONTINUED: (3) 
WALT (CONT'D) 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 86 Walt and the Barber laugh... 
TAO Boy does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job. Walt and the Barber laugh harder. 
INT. WALT'S OLD PICKUP TRUCK - MORNING 
WALT If you do this, you're going to follow through, right? 
TAO Yeah, yeah. 
WALT No, not yeah, yeah. Yes, as in yes, sir, I'll do my best. 
TAO Yes, I'll do my best. 
WALT You better, because when I vouch for someone, it's my word and I don't want anyone making me look bad. 
TAO No, I'm good. I'm totally into this. 
WALT And don't lay down to people all the time. Always look a person in the eye. When you shake a man's hand, you can usually tell where you stand with him. Walt hands a pair of beat-up WORK GLOVES to Tao. 
WALT Here, stuff these in your back pocket. 
TAO Cool. 
WALT Just don't blow this.

PAGE 87 Walt and Tao walk up to the Superintendent's Office Trailer on a construction job site. 
INT. JOB TRAILER - SAME TIME 
Walt and Tao come in. Walt shakes hands with TIM KENNEDY, the job super. 
WALT Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon, how the hell are ya? 
KENNEDY Shitty, but who's gonna listen? 
WALT Not me. Walt pours himself a cup of the bad job-site coffee. 
KENNEDY Help yourself, Walt, you dumb Pollack. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 90 
TAO Cool. Walt pitches a hardware pouch at Tao. 
WALT And you need this too. That should about do it. 
TAO Not to bitch, but won't I be needing some tools? 
WALT Tools I got, but I ain't loaning you my tool belt. You can buy tools as you go. 
TAO I appreciate all this. 
WALT Aw, forget it. 
TAO No, I really do. Thank you. Walt sticks out his jaw and looks Tao straight in the eye. Tao doesn't know what to expect. A PAUSE. Walt puts out his HAND to Tao. Tao extends his and they SHAKE HANDS. It's really quite a moment for both of them. 
EXT. BUS STOP - AFTERNOON 
Tao gets off the bus, his tool belt over his shoulder. Tao looks tired after working, but content. He walks past an abandoned lot. The tricked-out Honda pulls up and stops. Smokie, Spider and company get out. Tao looks nervous, but remains calm. 
TAO What now? 
SPIDER Just seeing what you're up to, cuz. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 91 
TAO I'm getting home from work, not that you guys would know much about that. 
SPIDER So it's true? You got a job. 
TAO Come on, what do you guys want with me? 
SMOKIE Jesus Christ, Tao. What do you think? I've been sooooo easy on you, but I can't just go on like nothing happened. 
TAO You can't just leave me alone? 
SMOKIE Afraid not. The gangbangers grab Tao. Tao kicks and struggles as they yank away his tool belt. 
TAO Keep your hands off my stuff. 
SMOKIE Your stuff? You and everything you have is mine. I own you. Smokie pulls the tape measure off the belt and smashes it against the pavement. Whatever tools Smokie can't destroy, he tosses onto the roof of the closest building. 
SMOKIE You can't just walk away from us, Tao. It looks bad. It makes me look bad. Smokie lights a CIGARETTE and exhales... 
SMOKIE What's the phrase I'm looking for? Oh yeah, I need to save face.' Smokie grabs Tao by the neck and presses the lit CIGARETTE into Tao's cheek. Tao screams as his flesh burns. 
CONTINUED: 
PAGE 92 
EXT. WALT'S ALLEY - MORNING 
Walt spots Tao as he takes out the trash. 
WALT Hey there. Tao looks to the ground and heads in the other direction. 
TAO Hey, I gotta run. 
WALT Wait a minute. Where have you been, I haven't seen you in days? 
TAO Busy. Walt squints at Tao. He steps closer. Tao looks away. Walt tilts Tao's head up, he sees the burn. 
WALT What in the hell happened to you? 
TAO Don't worry about it. 
WALT Don't worry about it? Look at your goddamned face! 
TAO I said don't worry about it. It's not your problem. Walt looks at the ground and spits. 
WALT When? 
TAO Couple days ago. Grabbed me after I got off the bus coming home from work. 
PAGE 102 Father Janovich grabs four beers, two for each of them. He opens a Pabst and takes a big swig. 
FATHER JANOVICH Damn all this. It just isn't fair. 
WALT Nothing's fair, Father. Father Janovich and Walt sit for awhile. 
FATHER JANOVICH So, what are you going to do, Mr. Kowalski? 
WALT Call me Walt. Father Janovich nods. 
FATHER JANOVICH Alright, what are you going to do, Walt? 
WALT Not sure yet. All I do know is they don't have a goddamned chance. 
INT. WALT'S KITCHEN - MORNING 
Walt sits at the kitchen table in his robe, drinking coffee. Tao comes in without even knocking on the door. 
TAO What are you doing? 
WALT I'm thinking. 
TAO Thinking time is over. Now it's time to knock the ass out of those pricks. 
WALT I know you don't want to hear this, but you have to calm down. 
TAO What?! 
CONTINUED: (2) 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 103 
WALT You have to have a clear head, otherwise mistakes get made. Back away from what's happened, Tao. 
TAO No. Don't let me down, Walt. Not you. This is going to end, today. Walt stands up and pulls out a chair for Tao to sit in. 
WALT Sit down. 
TAO I don't want to sit. 
WALT I SAID SIT DOWN! Just listen up for a second and don't say anything. Tao sits down. Walt rubs his hands together. 
WALT I know what needs to be done. I need to prepare, this needs to be carefully planned. You know I'm the right man for this. So cool down for a little while and meet me back here at 4 P.M. I promise you, what needs to be done, will be done. 
TAO I say we go now. Right now. 
WALT And do what? You want to go kill your cousin and those other Zips. Mr. Tough-Guy-All-Of-A-Sudden is out for blood. What do you even know about it? Tao is furious, but says nothing. 
WALT Trust me, Tao. Cool down and we'll meet back here at four. Okay? Tao doesn't answer. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 104 
WALT I said okay?' You won't do anything without me. You meet me back here at four? Say okay.' 
TAO Okay. Tao storms out the back door. Walt pours more coffee. 
INT. BATHROOM 
Walt soaks in the tub. It's filled with bubbles. Walt looks over at Daisy who rests on a towel in the corner. Walt lights a CIGARETTE and exhales. Daisy curls up her lips at the smoke. 
WALT I know, I know. Give me a break, it's the first time I've ever smoked in the house. 
EXT. WALT'S YARD - DAY 
Walt meticulously mows his lawn. He carefully trims around the fence and birdbath. 
INT. OLD SCHOOL BARBERSHOP 
Martin finishes cutting Walt's hair. 
BARBER There, all done. Ten bucks American. 
WALT I don't suppose you still have steady enough hands to give a guy a straight shave, you withered, old Italian mummy? 
BARBER You? A straight shave? You've never ordered a straight shave, ever. 
FATHER JANOVICH I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski. 
WALT Is that so? 
FATHER JANOVICH It is. And every other day until you see the folly in what you are planning. 
WALT I gotta go, Padre. Busy day ahead. 
FATHER JANOVICH Go in peace. 
WALT I am at peace. Walt and Father Janovich shake hands. Walt exits. Father Janovich exhales loudly and drops into his chair. 
FATHER JANOVICH Je -- zuz -- Christ. 
INT. WALT'S KITCHEN - 3:51 P.M. 
Walt carefully reassembles the two weapons he just cleaned and oiled. Tao comes in and looks down at the two weapons -- The 30-06 M1 GARAND RIFLE and the COLT .45 PISTOL. Tao picks up the heavy RIFLE. 
TAO Which one do I get? 
WALT You ever fire a weapon? 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 108 
TAO No. Tao aims the rifle at an imaginary target. 
WALT Put that down. I got something for you. 
TAO What? 
WALT In Korea, October, 1952. We were sent up to sweep a Chink machine gun nest that had carved us up pretty bad. I was the only one who came back... I received the Silver Star. I want you to have it. 
TAO Why? 
WALT When we went up that hill, we knew it was ten to one against us, but we went anyway. This trouble now, it's similar. We're walking right into it. We might not be coming home tonight. 
TAO The hell we won't. We're going to roll in there and tear ass. 
WALT Don't be a fool, these guys are waiting for that exact reaction. Tao is quiet for a minute. 
TAO How many? 
WALT How many what? 
TAO How many men did you kill in Korea? 
WALT Thirteen for sure. Probably more. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 109 
TAO What was it like to kill a man? 
WALT You don't want to know. 
TAO Why not? 
WALT Go get the Silver Star. It's in a blue wooden box in the cellar. Tao goes downstairs. He turns on the light and goes into the cellar. Tao locates a BLUE WOODEN BOX and opens it. Tao holds up the MEDAL. He looks at it closely. AND WHAM -- Walt slams the heavy cellar DOOR shut behind him. Walt slides the BOLT LOCK into place with a loud 
CLICK. Tao couldn't kick his way out of there in ten years. Of course he tries anyway. Tao is furious. He throws things. 
TAO What the hell are you doing?! Let me out of here, you goddamned son- of-a-bitch!! 
WALT Quit smashing everything. You'll never get out of there, so just relax. 
TAO You let me out, you crazy old fuck, or I will kill you when I get out of here. Tao pounds on the door. Walt pounds back with a strength and authority which startles Tao. 
WALT You want to know how it feels to kill a man? It feels goddamned lousy. And it feels even worse when you get a medal for bravery right after you mowed down some scared kid when he tries to give up. A dumb, scared, little gook, just about your age. I shot him with the same rifle you just held upstairs.

PHONG 
(SUBTITLED) Who was that? Where are you going? You tell me what's going on?! Sue squirms away from Phong and runs outside. On her way over to Walt's house, she sees Daisy leashed to Phong's chair. It scares Sue even more. 
EXT. SMOKIE'S DUPLEX - AFTERNOON 
Father Janovich paces back and forth. The SQUAD CAR pulls up to him, which is exactly what he's been afraid of all day. 
OFFICER Sorry, Father, we have to go. 
FATHER JANOVICH I'm telling you. If we're not here, there will be bloodshed. 
OFFICER We've been here for hours. We can't afford to anchor a unit to one location. 
FATHER JANOVICH I'm begging you to stay. 
OFFICER I just got word from my Sergeant, we're pulling the plug. 
FATHER JANOVICH I'm staying. 
OFFICER No you aren't. My orders are specific. You came with us, you're leaving with us. Father Janovich looks hard at the duplex before getting into the SQUAD CAR. The SQUAD CAR drives off. Walt pulls up in front, gets out of his pickup and slams the door. He looks at the duplex. It's a total eyesore. 
WALT 
(MUTTERS) What a goddamned mess. You slopes should be ashamed of yourselves. 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 114 Walt walks up the sidewalk and stops twenty feet from the duplex. Six very scared, very jittery Hmong gangbangers look out at Walt from various doorways and windows. 
WALT Is that all you swamp rats or is there more vermin scurrying in the shadows? Smokie and Spider step out and stand on the porch. Smokie smiles at Walt. Walt spits on the ground. 
SMOKIE I wasn't sure that you'd... 
WALT Shut up, gook. I'm not here to listen to one goddamned syllable of what a shrimp-dicked little baby midget like you has to say. Spider pulls his PISTOL. 
WALT That's right, boy. Defend your boyfriend after he or you or whoever rapes a member of your family. Your own blood, for Christ's sake. Go ahead, pull your pistols, just like a bunch of ridiculous miniature toy cowboys. Smokie and several other Hmong gangbangers pull their guns. 
WALT You have no honor. You're the scum of the earth and when you're gone, do you think anyone will care? No one will mourn. You won't be missed. All the Hmong are spooked at Walt's absolute lack of fear. 
SMOKIE Where's Tao, old man? He too scared to come and stick up for himself? 
CONTINUED: 
(CONTINUED) 
PAGE 115 
WALT No. Tao is too good for this. You pukes aren't worth one second of his time. Walt slowly puts a CIGARETTE in his mouth. Even this slight movement has the gangbangers waving their PISTOLS around. Walt laughs. 
WALT You boys are a little bit jumpy. 
SPIDER You watch it, old man. 
WALT No, I think you'd better watch it. Walt looks around. Other than the gangbangers, a small group of people have gathered to watch this showdown. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WALT'S HOUSE 
Sue opens the front door, runs to the stairwell and pounds down the stairs. 
SUE Tao? Tao, are you alright? 
TAO (O.S.) 
I'M DOWN HERE! LET ME OUT!! She unlocks the CELLAR DOOR. Tao comes out in a rage. 
TAO Goddamn it! 
SUE What's going on? 
TAO He left without me! 
SUE Where? Where'd he go?! 
TAO He went to Smokie's without me. Tao takes the stairs two steps at a time.

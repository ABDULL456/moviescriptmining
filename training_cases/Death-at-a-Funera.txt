INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
MUSIC CUE: The music fades out. TIGHT SHOT on AARON (CHRIS ROCK) thirties, dressed in a black suit and tie. He looks straight ahead with a somber expression. The camera pulls back to reveal he is watching FOUR UNDERTAKERS (INCLUDING BRIAN) place a coffin on a raised platform. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The living room has been prepared for the funeral service, with several rows of chairs laid out. 
BRIAN Would you like to see... Aaron nods his head "yes", as BRIAN begins to open the coffin. Aaron crosses to the coffin. There's a dramatic moment as Aaron moves to the coffin and braces himself for what he's about to see. The coffin opens and Aaron stares long and hard at the body. 
AARON Brian... who is that? 
BRIAN Excuse me? 
AARON Who is this man I'm looking at? 'Cause it's not my father. 
BRIAN Are you sure? 
AARON Are you asking me if I'm sure I know what my father looks like? 
BRIAN People make mistakes in times of grief. 
AARON Man, look at the damn body! Brian peers into the coffin. We see it's an ASIAN MAN. 
BRIAN Oh shit! The other undertakers look embarrassed. 
AARON Come on, Brian. You know what my father looks like. He used to take you to little league. 
BRIAN I'm sorry, man. I got a little nervous. This almost never happens. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
AARON It's happened before?! You mean this is a normal thing?... This isn't Burger King. You can't just mess up my order. 
MICHELLE Yes. Today's the last day of this cycle. 
AARON Can I at least find the body first? 
EXT. FREEWAY - WIDE SHOT - DAY 
We see NORMAN'S CAR speeding along the freeway. 
INT. NORMAN'S CAR - MOVING - DAY 
NORMAN, black, slightly heavier and riddled with anxiety, is driving. His friend, DEREK, an attractive, white, clean cut doctor, rides in the passenger seat. 
NORMAN I hate funerals. It's all death, death, death. 
DEREK I don't think funerals are designed for anybody to really like. 
NORMAN I don't want a regular funeral. When I die, I want people to celebrate my life. 
(CONTINUED) 
Death at a Funeral 02/6/09 
CONTINUED: 
DEREK Not me. I want it to be the saddest day ever. I want the stock market to stop. Schools to close. And no garbage pick-up. Derek starts to light a cigarette. 
NORMAN You still smoke? 
DEREK You used to smoke. 
NORMAN I used to piss my pants too, but I stopped. The only thing I want black is my skin. At least open the window. Derek opens the window very slightly. 
NORMAN (CONT'D) I've got enough problems of my own to deal with. 
DEREK 
(DUBIOUS) Yeah? What problems? 
NORMAN I told you... About the rash... 
DEREK Got to use condoms. 
NORMAN .on my hand... 
DEREK Still got to use condoms. 
NORMAN Look at it. Norman pulls up his sleeve and makes Derek look at his wrist, but he doesn't take a great deal of interest. 
DEREK That's not a rash. 
NORMAN What is it? 
(CONTINUED) 
B. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
DEREK I don't know, but it doesn't look right. 
NORMAN Oh, damn. Norman continues to drive. Derek continues to smoke. 
NORMAN (CONT'D) If you hate funerals so much why are you coming? 
DEREK You know why. 
NORMAN Come on, man, leave Elaine alone. 
DEREK I can't. She's the one. 
NORMAN So you're going to win her back over a dead body? 
DEREK If I have to. 
INT. ELAINE'S CAR - MOVING - DAY 
ELAINE, very attractive, 27, and her boyfriend OSCAR, white, 35, are driving along wearing funeral attire. Oscar looks quite anxious as he keeps his eyes firmly on the road. 
ELAINE Are you okay? 
OSCAR Yeah, just a little nervous... 
We see Norman's car exiting the freeway. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Aaron and Michelle are standing to the side as the undertakers place the coffin on the stand. Brian nervously lifts the lid and Aaron looks inside. 
BRIAN 
(RESPECTFUL) So is this your father? 
AARON Come on, man. You know that's my father. 
BRIAN Just trying to be professional. What up, Michelle? 
MICHELLE 
(DRYLY) Brian. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He closes the lid and all four undertakers quietly head off. Aaron looks up and sees his mother, Cynthia, has entered the room. Cynthia is clearly drained and tired. She stares at the coffin. 
AARON Mom, how are you feeling? 
CYNTHIA There were so many things we wanted to do... We were going to go to China. 
AARON China? You don't even like Chinese food. 
CYNTHIA That's not the point. I haven't been feeling good. Who knows how long I'm going to live without him. It happens all the time. One spouse goes and then the next. I mean, it might be different if I had a grandchild to take my mind off of everything. 
MICHELLE Cynthia, I-- They all cross to the coffin. 
AARON (cuts Michelle off) Come on, Mom. You're healthy. You'll be fine. You've got your friends and family... Cynthia, Aaron and Michelle stand around the coffin. 
CYNTHIA Where is Ryan? Have you heard from him? 
AARON He'll be here soon. 
CYNTHIA Just seeing that boy's face makes me feel better. I've missed him so much. My baby. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) She looks down at the coffin. Aaron turns away frustrated. Michelle gently touches the coffin. 
MICHELLE Do you need anything, Cynthia? 
CYNTHIA Yeah, you can get your hand off my husband's coffin. You're leaving smudge marks. Michelle tries to wipe it off with her sleeve. 
EXT. STREET - JEFF'S HOUSE - DAY 
MUSIC: "PAPER PLANE" by M.I.A. Elaine and Oscar are walking up the stairs of a typical college apartment building. 
INT. JEFF'S HOUSE - SAME 
The music is coming from Jeff's speakers. JEFF, dressed for the funeral, sits at his desk. He's holding a pill bottle that says: "VALIUM." 
JEFF Yeah, I found them. The ones in the Valium bottle?... Yeah... I'll get them to you this evening... Can't do this afternoon... It's your fault you left them here... I've got a funeral... My uncle died... Yeah, tragic... No, I haven't taken any. I saw what they did to you... What are they anyway?... The doorbell rings. 
JEFF (CONT'D) I've gotta go, my sister's here... I'll take them with me and stop by after the funeral... Bye. The doorbell rings again. 
JEFF (CONT'D) Hang on! Jeff stands up and we see that he's only half dressed for the funeral. He doesn't have any pants on. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He puts the bottle on the counter then crosses to the door and lets Elaine and Oscar inside. 
JEFF (CONT'D) Hey, what's up? 
ELAINE Do you always open the door half naked? Come on, Jeff. We're going to be late. 
JEFF I've just got to put my pants on and I'm ready. Oscar is still a little shaky. 
JEFF (CONT'D) 
(RE: OSCAR) Is he okay? 
ELAINE Oscar's freaked out. A guy on a bike ran into the car. 
OSCAR It came out of nowhere. I didn't see him. I'm sorry. 
ELAINE It's okay, baby. (then to Jeff) Go put your damn pants on. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Jeff's face reveals his realization of what's happened. He walks off, leaving Elaine watching Oscar. 
EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY 
Norman's car is almost at the corner still being forced backwards by the flower van. We see that Derek is still lost in his own thoughts. Uncle Russell is poking at Norman with his cane. 
UNCLE RUSSELL You're going the wrong way! 
NORMAN Ow! That hurts. 
DEREK Stop the car, Norman. 
NORMAN What? 
DEREK Stop the car. I have to speak with her. I have to speak with Elaine. Norman reluctantly stops the car. Derek gets out. 
NORMAN What about Uncle Russell? I need help with Uncle Russell! It's too late. Derek is gone. The van in front of Norman honks the horn. 
UNCLE RUSSELL What's going on here? Where are we?! We're going to be late! Russell hits him on the arm with his cane. 
NORMAN Ow! Can you please stop doing that?! The van keeps beeping. Norman backs up. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Ryan is standing with Aaron. They greet the mourners. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RYAN 
(TO MOURNER) Nice to see you again. The mourner shakes hands with Ryan then walks away. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Who are all these people? I don't even recognize half of them. 
AARON It's your family. You don't recognize them from the last funeral? Ryan looks around the room. 
RYAN So what side of the family is he on? 
AARON Who? 
RYAN The guy in the leather jacket. Ryan looks around the room and sees a FOUR FOOT SIX MAN (FRANK) approaching the coffin. 
AARON I have no idea. Maybe a friend of Dad's from work or something. Aaron turns to Ryan. 
AARON (CONT'D) So, you're telling me I'm going to have to pay for the whole funeral? 
RYAN No I'm telling you you'll have the money in a few months when I get my advance. 
AARON I'm not a God damn credit agency! REVEREND DAVIS, a very calm, serene woman, suddenly appears. 
REVEREND DAVIS Aaron, how are you? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
AARON Yes, um... We're just waiting for everyone to arrive, then we can get going. I know you're in a hurry. 
REVEREND DAVIS Yes, I have two more funerals and a Christening. I don't know what it is about the Spring, but they're either coming in or going out. She laughs, but Aaron and Ryan just look at her. Reverend Davis stands there waiting to be introduced to Ryan. 
AARON Have you met my brother, Ryan? 
REVEREND DAVIS Ah, the writer, of course. I must admit I squeezed this job in because I wanted to meet you. I'm reading "Mama's Secret" right now. Don't tell anybody, I'm not supposed to be reading that kind of stuff. 
RYAN I'm sure the Lord will forgive you. Aaron is irritated. 
REVEREND DAVIS 
(TO AARON) You must be very proud of your big brother. He really made something of his life. 
(TO RYAN) I can't wait to hear your eulogy. 
AARON No, no, I'm doing the eulogy. 
REVEREND DAVIS Oh. I thought... 
RYAN Aaron is the oldest. The reverend tries her best not to look disappointed. 
UNCLE RUSSELL What are you doing?! Be careful with that. Uncle Russell bangs his cane on the floor impatiently. 
UNCLE RUSSELL (CONT'D) Hurry up, we're late. Norman slams the trunk closed. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Aaron tries to get across the room as Michelle heads into the kitchen. Ryan stops Aaron. 
AARON Oh, Ryan can you keep an eye out-- 
RYAN God damn, that Martina has grown up. ANGLE ON: MARTINA, nineteen and attractive. 
AARON Are you talking about Little Martina? 
RYAN She was like a teenager when I left, and now she's... you know. She's like damn. Aaron looks distastefully at his brother. 
AARON Can you keep an eye out for Uncle Russell? 
RYAN I think I should go see how she's been. 
AARON Yeah, why don't you do that? See if she wants a juice box. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Ryan heads off towards Martina. Aaron continues across the room. 
FRANK (O.S.) Hi there. Aaron turns and finds himself cornered by Frank. 
AARON Hello. 
FRANK I was really sorry to hear about your dad. He talked about you a lot. I saw your wedding pictures. Your wife's dress was very beautiful. Aaron is a little uncomfortable. 
AARON Uh... thanks. 
MAN Did he ever mention me?... Frank? Frank steps forward and holds out his hand. Aaron shakes it. 
AARON Frank?... I don't think so, no... Were you a friend of his? 
FRANK Something like that, yeah. Michelle sticks her head out of the kitchen. 
MICHELLE Honey. Can I see you for a moment? 
AARON Well, nice to meet you. Thanks for coming. Aaron walks away, leaving Frank alone. 
EXT. STREET - SAME TIME 
WIDE SHOT: Norman struggles to push Uncle Russell up a hill. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
UNCLE RUSSELL Come on, put your back into it. You're supposed to be a young man. Don't you have any strength? 
INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Aaron has almost made it across the room when he is intercepted by Reverend Davis. 
REVEREND DAVIS I think we should get started. really have to leave at three. 
AARON Sure. Can we just wait five minutes for my Uncle Russell? We can't start without him. 
REVEREND DAVIS .Of course. 
EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY 
Elaine and Jeff are talking to some mourners. 
ELAINE It's so nice to see you. 
WOMAN I'm so sorry to hear about your uncle. But he's in a better place now. I hear Ryan is doing the eulogy. Oscar, carrying a leaf, interrupts the conversation. 
OSCAR Look... Isn't it beautiful? He wanders off again. Elaine doesn't know what the hell is going on. 
JEFF Elaine, can I speak to you for a minute? 
ELAINE (to the mourner) I'll see you inside. Jeff takes Elaine's arm with some urgency and moves off to the side. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DUNCAN How's Pepperdine treating you? Is Professor Clarke still giving you a hard time? 
JEFF No, no. It's all worked out. Don't worry. 
DUNCAN I'm not worried about you. Duncan looks pointedly at Elaine, irritating her. Duncan looks at Oscar who is in the background. 
DUNCAN (CONT'D) So I see you brought your friend. 
ELAINE He's my boyfriend. And you know his name. Derek approaches. 
DEREK Doctor, how nice to see you again. 
DUNCAN Derek. How are you doing at the hospital? 
DEREK Great. Great. We should have lunch soon. I'd love to hear what you think about the new pediatric wing at Cedar's. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
DUNCAN Definitely. Maybe Elaine would like to join us for lunch? They both look expectantly at Elaine who looks away disgusted. Cynthia comes up to them and kisses Elaine and Jeff hello. Oscar stares at her. 
CYNTHIA Elaine... Jeff... good to see you. 
ELAINE I'm so sorry, Auntie. We're going to miss Uncle Edward so much. 
JEFF Yeah. He was a great guy. 
CYNTHIA Thank you. 
ELAINE Oscar, this is my Aunt-- Oscar grabs Cynthia in a tight hug. 
OSCAR I'm so sorry about... the death... He sings "Amazing Grace" softly as Duncan, Derek, Jeff and Elaine look on. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) Amazing Grace / How sweet the sound / That saved a wretch like me... Cynthia untangles herself from Oscar. She heads back outside. Duncan gives Elaine a look, then heads off after Cynthia. 
JEFF What are you going to do? 
ELAINE I don't know. I can't leave. Aunt Cynthia would never speak to me again. Jeff notices that Oscar has left. He rushes outside. Elaine follows. Derek follows suit. 
EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY 
We see Oscar emerging from the front doorway followed by Jeff. Then comes Elaine. Jeff approaches Oscar and stands with him as Elaine watches from the doorway. Derek walks up. 
DEREK You look nice, Elaine. 
ELAINE I'm dressed for a funeral. 
DEREK Yeah, but you make death look sexy. She looks at him. 
DEREK (CONT'D) So, I heard about the engagement. 
ELAINE Hey, hey. I don't really have time to deal with whatever happened between you and me. But I have not told my dad yet, so I would appreciate it if you would keep your mouth shut. 
DEREK Sure. Anything for you. Derek looks over and notices Oscar looking bewildered. 
DEREK (CONT'D) So that's him? That's the man you're going to spend the rest of your life with? Elaine looks over at the drugged up Oscar. Oscar leans over like he's on a nod. Jeff leans down with him, watching. Right before Oscar falls over, he comes up really fast.- Then he starts walking. 
ELAINE Yep, that's him. Oscar who has been walking in circles with a look of awe on his face, changes direction and flies by Elaine and Derek back into the house with Jeff in tow. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DEREK Elaine., I- Elaine follows the guys, leaving Derek behind. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME 
Aaron is straightening his tie and practicing his eulogy. 
AARON My father was an exceptional man... My father was-- Frank again approaches Aaron. 
FRANK Actually, there's something I'd like to talk to you about... when you have a minute. Aaron hears Uncle Russell in the background. 
AARON Yeah, that's great. Do you mind if we do it later though? My uncle just got here. 
FRANK Sure. Aaron heads off. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOUSE - SAME TIME 
Norman pushes Russell up the stairs close to where Derek is standing. He looks like he's about to collapse from exhaustion. Norman lets go of the wheelchair and catches his breath. Derek grabs the chair blocking Norman from view just as Aaron arrives. 
AARON Good afternoon, everyone. (his voice cracks) Thank you for coming... I never realized Dad was so popular. It looks like he's got more friends now that he's dead. Blank faces stare back at Aaron. Cynthia looks pained. Everyone is silent except for Oscar who laughs loudly. Elaine silences him with a look. Aaron composes himself and pulls his notes out. 
AARON (CONT'D) My father was an exceptional man... He was born in 1938. He grew up in Alabama on a farm. He loved to take long walks in the woods with his close friend, Bobby. He told me how they spent their summer days riding their bikes through the fields and swimming in the lake. As Aaron speaks, Reverend Davis looks concerned because the eulogy is so bad. She looks to Ryan who looks like "what can I do?" Jeff looks more concerned with Oscar, whose face is contorted with pain. He looks like he's going to burst. ANGLE ON: Aaron. 
AARON (CONT'D) Dad's first job was working after school as an assistant to an electrician named Mr. Thompson. Back then, Blacks weren't allowed to wear rubber gloves. So my father got shocked a lot. Because of that, he had no feeling in his fingertips. I asked my Dad what his first boss was like... The drugs have gotten the best of Oscar. He suddenly grabs Elaine's arm. Aaron keeps talking. 
OSCAR Did you just see that? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) 
ELAINE See what? 
OSCAR The coffin just moved. 
ELAINE What? 
OSCAR I'm telling you I saw it move. Aaron becomes vaguely aware of the disturbance, but battles on with his eulogy. 
AARON .He said he was a nice man, and surprisingly well dressed. When Dad was eighteen, he left home after an argument with his father. He never told me what that argument was about, but I do know that after leaving South Carolina, sadly he and Bob lost touch and never saw each other again. Dad went to college where he studied accounting, a decision which lead to a career in corporate finance... But his real passion was for the arts, with a particular fondness for theatre, dance and musicals. He was a charter member of the Negro Ensemble Company and contributed regularly to the Alvin Ailey School of Dance. Oscar's protests are getting louder. Duncan looks back at the disruption with a disapproving glare. Elaine looks at Jeff who watches, concerned. 
OSCAR There, look. It happened again. 
ELAINE Oscar, please- People start looking at Oscar, who's becoming increasingly vocal, and looking increasingly like someone on acid. 
OSCAR That coffin's moving! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (5) 
ELAINE 
(WHISPERS) Oscar. Just calm down. Aaron looks over to Oscar. 
OSCAR 
(SHOUTS) The coffin's moving! Michelle looks worried. Cynthia watches silently. Oscar jumps up. Aaron stops the eulogy. Elaine is about to die from embarrassment. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) There's someone alive in there! 
ELAINE Oscar, please sit down. Oscar ignores her and walks purposefully towards the coffin. People watch him in astonishment, including Jeff. 
OSCAR What the hell is wrong with you people?! Oscar approaches the coffin as Aaron steps off the dais. Elaine tries to hold Oscar back, but she can't. 
ELAINE 
(PANICKED) Oscar, where are you going? 
AARON What are you doing? 
OSCAR There's someone moving in there. Can't you see? Oscar tries to open the coffin. Aaron and Elaine try to restrain him, but can't. A tussle begins. Ryan jumps in to help. 
RYAN What the hell is wrong with you?! 
ELAINE Ryan, no! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (6) Elaine attempts to grab Ryan. Duncan stands up and tries to help. 
DUNCAN Get away from there! 
OSCAR No, I have to show you! He's alive! He's alive! The scene descends into absolute chaos with people pushing and struggling. Finally, the coffin falls off the platform and tips over. The dead body of Edward rolls out onto the floor at the feet of Cynthia. Cynthia screams. Aaron freezes in shock. Michelle takes Cynthia through the kitchen. The living room is left in chaos. 
EXT. BACK GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Elaine drags Oscar out the back. Jeff follows. 
INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME 
Cynthia, in tears, enters accompanied by Aaron, Michelle and Reverend Davis. 
MICHELLE It's alright, Cynthia. It's alright. She sits in a chair crying uncontrollably. Aaron is so angry, he just marches out. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Some MEN grab the body and put it back in the coffin. Aaron comes out of the kitchen and heads to the back yard. As they put the coffin back on the stand, Ryan addresses the crowd. 
RYAN Please let me extend my apologies to you all. I understand the incident you just witnessed was quite shocking, but everything will be... returned... to it's proper place. Please enjoy the refreshments, and we'll call you when we're ready to continue. 
ELAINE Come and sit down. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Aaron talks to a mourner. Norman comes up and hugs him. 
NORMAN Are you alright?... That was insane. He just fell out the coffin like a dead fish. I guess its not much of a metaphor when you're talking about a dead human, but-- 
(CONTINUED) 
Death at a Funeral 02/6/0.9 49. 
CONTINUED: Aaron looks at Norman. 
AARON Norman, please. 
NORMAN Oh yeah... Sorry. It's just that you never know when it's your time. Like, I have this weird thing on my wrist. I've had it for a few weeks now. I don't know what it is-- 
AARON Why don't you show it to my Uncle Duncan? He's a doctor. 
NORMAN He is? Great. Thanks. Norman walks off toward the kitchen. He passes Uncle Russell and Ryan talking to Martina. 
UNCLE RUSSELL I read your last book, "Black Hurt." 
RYAN Good, good. Thanks a lot. 
UNCLE RUSSELL I'm not giving you a compliment you arrogant bastard. What a load of bullshit. I wouldn't wipe my ass with it. Ryan leads Martina away from Uncle Russell. 
EXT. BACK GARDEN - SITTING AREA - DAY 
Oscar, Elaine and Jeff are standing together. 
OSCAR I swear it was moving. I must be losing my mind... (looks at his hands) Why are my hands so big?! 
ELAINE Oscar, listen to me. I need to tell you something... Elaine sits him down on the bench. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
OSCAR What is it? 
ELAINE Now... You remember I gave you some Valium earlier? 
OSCAR Yes. 
ELAINE Well it turns out that it wasn't actually Valium. Oscar just looks at Elaine. Jeff slinks off into the background. 
ELAINE (CONT'D) Can you hear me? 
OSCAR 
(YELLS) Hello? 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Cynthia is being comforted by her friends and Duncan. Norman enters and beckons Duncan over to the side. 
NORMAN Hello, Doctor, I know this is a bad time, but I've got this thing on my hand. I've had it for weeks now... Duncan is looking at Norman incredulously. 
NORMAN (CONT'D) What do you think it is? Cynthia stands up. 
CYNTHIA Duncan, I'm going back now. She exits. Reluctantly, Duncan answers Norman. 
DUNCAN You should probably go see a dermatologist. He turns to follow his sister out, but Norman pulls him back. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NORMAN Really? Why? What do you think it is? 
DUNCAN I don't know. It looks like some kind of pigment mutation. Duncan walks further out of the room. 
NORMAN Pigment mutation?! Duncan turns again. 
DUNCAN You're probably just allergic to something. Maybe from shellfish, nuts... Duncan heads further out of the room, but Norman won't give up. 
NORMAN Nuts? What kind of nuts? Duncan turns around again. 
DUNCAN I don't know. Pecans? Peanuts?... Excuse me. Duncan finally exits, leaving Norman looking shocked and terrified. 
Oscar is talking to himself in the mirror. 
OSCAR Okay. Breathe. 
(HE DOES) It's going to be okay. Breathe. You're and investment banker. You've handled mergers for billion dollar companies. You can do this. Dead bodies don't move. They don't move. But that body was moving. It was moving. Then he slaps himself. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) Snap out of it! You can handle this. You can do this. He runs the tap and splashes some water on his face. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) Alright. You're okay. Stay calm... Stay calm... Oscar is still staring at himself in the mirror. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) That's it, Oscar, keep it together. K.I.T. Keep it together. K.I.T. Keep it together. Everything's going to be fine. Nothing moved. Dead people don't move. They're stiff. They don't move, do they?

Elaine has her ear pressed against the door. She hears the scream. 
INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME 
OSCAR Easy now. Easy now. We can do this. A few hours. That's nothing. No sweat. I mean you've already been in here for... He looks at his watch. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) Where's my watch?! He sees it's on the other wrist. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) Oh! He checks the time. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) It's already been... 
INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - SAME TIME 
Elaine continues to knock on the door. 
ELAINE Open the door. Oscar. 
INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME 
Oscar finally gets a read on his watch. 
OSCAR Five minutes. Suddenly the pressure of. the situation overtakes him. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) God damn! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! 
INT. DOWNSTAIRS'- SAME TIME 
As the screaming and cursing goes on upstairs, Aaron approaches a mourner who looks concerned. 
OSCAR (O.S.) Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! 
AARON It's alright. Aaron turns around not knowing what to do. 
FRANK (O.S.) Grief does strange things to people. Aaron looks at him a little freaked out by his sudden appearance. 
AARON I guess so. 
FRANK If you remember, I have something to talk to you about. 
AARON Oh yeah. 
FRANK Is there somewhere private we could go? 
AARON Sure. They walk away. The screaming continues as Jeff, frantically, but slowly comes down the stairs re-tracing his steps and searching around for his lost bottle of pills. 
INT. STUDY - DAY 
Frank and Aaron enter. Frank looks around the room a little grief stricken himself. Aaron walks to the desk as Frank touches some mementoes he clearly remembers. Frank takes out his glasses and notices a manuscript on the desk with Aaron's name. 
FRANK Are you writing a novel? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
FRANK (CONT'D) I'll tell you how it makes me feel cheap. Like some cheap piece of ass... I mean, I'm entitled to something. 
AARON What do you want? 
FRANK What I want is a lot, but I'm not asking you for what I want. I deserve thirty thousand dollars. 
AARON Thirty thousand dollars?! I can't just give you thirty thousand dollars. My wife and I are trying to have kids-- 
FRANK Your father told me you were having trouble... 
(BEAT) Look, your father promised to take care of me, and I made sacrifices to keep him happy. Aaron gets angry. 
AARON You think you can come in here, slander my father's name and show me a few photos of you and my dad dressed up going to see "Dreamgirls"? I saw "Dreamgirls" twice. I'm not gay. That's not proof of anything... "Steppin' to the bad side / Gonna take a mean ride." 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) Aaron grabs Frank and pushes him against the wall. 
AARON (CONT'D) I'm not giving you anything but a-- Frank pulls out another photo and holds it up to Aaron's face. Aaron,releases Frank and snatches the picture. 
FRANK Now I don't want to, but I will show these photos to your mother... Do you really want me to do that today? 
AARON Wait here. He exits the study. 
INT. ENTRY CORRIDOR - DAY 
Aaron closes the study door behind him and almost bumps into two male mourners. 
MIDDLE AGED MAN Aaron, I was just telling George here how when we were boys together your dad used to love to make us all go skinny dipping. Aaron just stares at them. Then he moves toward the living room. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - BUFFET - DAY 
Aaron crosses the living room which is full of people mingling around. He's gone pale. 
AARON 
(TO HIMSELF) Oh God, oh God, oh God... He's looking around for Ryan, but there's no sign-. -Michelle watches Aaron walk around the room.

Elaine is banging on the bathroom door. 
ELAINE Oscar. Open the door. Derek arrives behind her and leans in close. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DEREK Anything I can do to help? 
ELAINE Not really, thanks. Derek moves over to face her and leans his arm on the door very coolly. 
DEREK I guess you've got it under control. Elaine ignores him and continues banging on the door. 
ELAINE Oscar? Anguished noises emanate from the bathroom. 
ELAINE (CONT'D) Oscar! Open the door. 
DEREK So what are you doing after the funeral? I've got Maxwell tickets. 
ELAINE Look... I'm busy. I don't have time for your shit. Now get the hell away from me! Derek looks hurt and storms off. 
ELAINE (CONT'D) Oscar! 
INT. BACK OF KITCHEN - DAY 
Ryan is talking to Martina. 
RYAN .so you've never been to New York? 
MARTINA I've been with my parents once. 
RYAN Oh, that's not really seeing New York. You have to come visit me. When's your birthday? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARTINA I turn eighteen next month. 
RYAN Great. All star weekend is in New York this year. 
DEREK I don't want to. 
NORMAN Just do me a favor-- Norman is pushing the cake towards Derek's mouth. 
DEREK Get away from me. Derek gets up and walks off, leaving Norman spitting out the cake. From under the table, Jeff pops up. 
JEFF You haven't seen a pill bottle around, have you? A Valium pill bottle? 
NORMAN No. But can you try this-- Jeff smiles nervously and goes back to his search on the floor. Jeff slides across the floor past Uncle Russell sitting at the other end of the table. An OLDER LADY turns to Russell. 
OLDER LADY Edward and I watched the Tony Awards every year. We would get all dressed up and sip cocktails. I'm going to miss him so much. 
UNCLE RUSSELL Don't worry. The way you look, you won't be far behind. The mourner looks shocked. Jeff continues his search along the floor. 
EXT. BACK GARDEN - SITTING AREA - DAY 
Cynthia is sitting quietly with Duncan. 
DUNCAN I'm sure we'll start soon. He looks toward the house and sees Norman exit. Duncan wants to avoid him. 
DUNCAN (CONT'D) 
(TO CYNTHIA) Let's go inside. 
CYNTHIA In a moment. Duncan gets up and heads toward the house. He passes Norman. 
NORMAN Doctor, I just have a-- Duncan doesn't stop, leaving Norman holding his wrist. Norman looks over and sees Cynthia. He sits next to her. 
NORMAN (CONT'D) I'm sorry... you know... about... you know... 
CYNTHIA Thank you. I'll be alright. I know he's watching over me. 
NORMAN You think so?' I mean, there are a lot of fine ones up in heaven. Anna Nicole Smith's dead too, you know. might be watching over her. Norman sits next to Cynthia. 
NORMAN (CONT'D) Death is a terrible thing... Did you check to make sure he.was wearing shoes? I hear they steal the shoes. And I hope you took off his ring, 'cause if it's worth anything, someone is going to take that, too. Cynthia stares at Norman. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NORMAN (CONT'D) Before he died, did he have a rash? She gets up and exits. Norman notices Jeff's pill bottle on the ground. He picks it up and puts it in his pocket. 
INT. KITCHEN - LATER 
The camera closes in on the closed garage door. We hear hushed voices. 
INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS 
AARON You don't understand. If we don't give him the money, he's going to show Mom the picture. 
RYAN Okay. Let me think, let me think. Ryan is trying to come up with a solution. 
RYAN (CONT'D) I think you should pay him the money. 
AARON What do you mean, you think I should pay him the money? Where the hell is all your money? 
RYAN I'm in debt up to my ass. I'm broke, man! 
AARON So after paying for the funeral, the clothes, the catering... Now I'm supposed to shell out thirty thousand dollars? He's your father, too. 
RYAN You're the oldest. Besides, you've been living off Mom and Dad long enough. You must have some money saved. You haven't paid rent in two years. 
AARON I have not been living off of them... I've been living with them. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
AARON (CONT'D) No I haven't paid rent, but Dad hasn't worked in five years. Who do you think has been paying all the bills? 
RYAN Well if you've got money problems and I've got money problems, what can we do? Fuck him! Aaron shows Ryan the photo again. 
RYAN (CONT'D) You've got to pay him. 
INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME 
Oscar is sitting on the toilet unrolling the toilet paper. 
OSCAR Yes, yes. Keep coming. Join the others. Join the others. 
FRANK Well, you left it on a coffee table. 
AARON What's that supposed to mean? 
FRANK Well, when you put things on coffee tables, it's assumed it's for everybody. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RYAN It kind of is... 
AARON Can we get to the point here? 
FRANK Fine by me. Aaron is now extremely irritated. He exchanges a look with Ryan confirming that there's no other way out. 
AARON 
(TO FRANK) If I write this check, then that's it. You give us the photos and stay away from our mother. Deal? 
FRANK Deal. Aaron sits down at the desk and reluctantly takes out his check book. He starts writing. 
FRANK (CONT'D) 
(TO AARON) Is it your first one? Aaron stops writing and looks up at him. 
AARON What? 
FRANK The novel... it's a first draft? 
AARON Yeah. So? 
FRANK No, nothing. Aaron continues to write the check. 
FRANK (CONT'D) I tried writing once... Didn't work for me, either. I think it's just a gift. You either have it or you don't... It must be hard for you though, especially since your younger brother is such a great writer. 
(TO RYAN) 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
FRANK (CONT'D) Your father and I read "Black Hurt" together. Truly amazing. We loved it. He was so proud of you. 
RYAN Thanks... I guess... Aaron rips the check into little pieces. 
AARON That's it. I can't do it. 
RYAN Aaron, what are you doing? 
AARON There's no way in the world I'm giving him my hard earned money. 
RYAN Don't be stupid. Not today. I'll pay you back as soon as my money comes in. 
AARON He comes in today! Of all days, he picks the day of my father's funeral! Who the hell is he? 
RYAN He has the pictures! 
AARON So what. Who cares what he's got. Let him show the world. Put it on facebook. I don't care. 
RYAN 
AARON- 
AARON Let's just get it over with. There's a long pause as everyone seems to be deciding what to do. Finally, Frank stands up. 
FRANK Fine. This is on your head. Frank heads towards the door. 
RYAN What? No, wait. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) Ryan rushes to stand in front of the door, blocking Frank's 
EXIT 
FRANK Get out of my way. 
RYAN Let's just discuss this a minute. 
Aaron and Ryan enter and slam the door. 
RYAN Why didn't you just pay him the money?! 
AARON Why did you tie him up?! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RYAN Do you want Mom to find out?! 
AARON What is wrong with you? They start to argue. 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
We hear their muffled argument through the door. Uncle Russell rolls up to Derek who is sitting at the kitchen table. 
UNCLE RUSSELL What's your problem?! 
DEREK Women are my problem. 
UNCLE RUSSELL No such thing as having a woman without a problem. If they didn't have problems, do you think they'd let us touch 'em? Let me tell you something about women. Smarter than you think they are. But not as smart as they think they are. 
DEREK She acts like she doesn't care that I exist. I mean how can she not feel what I feel? 
UNCLE RUSSELL 
(LAUGHS) Oh she feels it. She's playing hard to get. She wants you to work for it. Look, let me tell something about women. They want a man who can control them. I know they talk all this Oprah, Beyonce "single women" BS, but what they really want is an old school man. 
DEREK Really? 
UNCLE RUSSELL Listen here, boy. This is what you do: you walk up to her, slap her-- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DEREK Slap her? You want me to hit her? 
UNCLE RUSSELL Has not hitting her worked? Look, then you grab her and kiss her. The harder the better. 
DEREK Are you sure, 'cause that-- 
UNCLE RUSSELL Oh, man, I gotta shit. Where's the can? He rolls away quickly. 
INT. STUDY - DAY 
Norman and Jeff are sitting in the study. Frank is on the floor tied up, breathing heavily and making gurgling sounds. 
JEFF I can't believe you gave him five. Even if they were Valium, that's too many. I wouldn't give a guy five cough drops. Suddenly they hear the doorknob rattle. Norman and Jeff both look terrified. 
FRANK 
(MUFFLED) Hello? Jeff covers his mouth. 
UNCLE RUSSELL (O.S.) Hello?! Neither Norman nor Jeff want to speak. They argue in gestures. Finally Jeff relents. 
JEFF Hello? 
UNCLE RUSSELL (O.S.) I need the toilet. Jeff and Norman both look panicked. Norman goes to the door. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NORMAN Can't you use the one upstairs? 
UNCLE RUSSELL (O.S.) I'm in a wheelchair, you idiot! How am I supposed to get up the stairs?! 
FRANK 
(MUFFLED) Hello? Norman and Jeff look at each other not knowing what to do. 
UNCLE RUSSELL (O.S.) Open the damn door! Uncle Russell starts banging on the door with his cane. 
NORMAN What are we going to do? They look at Frank who's starting to look high as a kite. 
JEFF We'll stick him behind the couch. 
NORMAN 
MICHELLE Yeah. 
AARON Well, I don't know how to say this, but... it looks like he and my father were having sex. 
MICHELLE What? No. Not your father. With him? 
AARON Yes. 
MICHELLE No. Your father was the straightest guy I know. 
RYAN That's what I thought. 
MICHELLE Are you sure? 
AARON And now he wants thirty thousand dollars or he's going to show everyone photos of them doing... stuff... 
MICHELLE Stuff like what? Aaron and Ryan share a look. Aaron shows Michelle the picture. She reacts. 
INT. STUDY BATHROOM - DAY 
Norman lifts Uncle Russell out of the chair. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
UNCLE RUSSELL Hurry up! Norman is struggling to hold Uncle Russell up. 
UNCLE RUSSELL (CONT'D) Have you got me? 
NORMAN Yes, I've got you. 
UNCLE RUSSELL Come on, quick, quick, quick. 
NORMAN Alright, I'm trying to see where the toilet is. He maneuvers Uncle Russell to the toilet. 
UNCLE RUSSELL Pants down. Pants down. 
NORMAN No you do it. 
UNCLE RUSSELL How can I do it? I'm handicapped. Norman reluctantly helps Uncle Russell pull his pants down. 
NORMAN Alright. Alright. 
UNCLE RUSSELL Drawers. Drawers. Take down my drawers. 
NORMAN Who calls them "drawers"? Norman pulls them down. 
NORMAN (CONT'D) It's all down. 
UNCLE RUSSELL Am I there? Am I there? Norman looks and sees Uncle Russell is right over the toilet. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
NORMAN Yes, yes. Just sit down. Uncle Russell sits down on the toilet trapping Norman's hand underneath and lets loose. 
UNCLE RUSSELL Ooh, that's better. Norman pulls his hand out and looks at it in shock. ANGLE ON: Norman's hand has shit on the fingers. He starts freaking out and screaming. 
INT. STUDY - DAY 
Jeff hears Norman and jumps up. 
NORMAN (O.S.) Ahh!!! Jeff goes into the bathroom to see what's going on. 
INT. STUDY BATHROOM - DAY 
Jeff opens the door and rushes in, but is stopped in his tracks by Norman's shitty hand. 
NORMAN Ahh!!! 
JEFF Ugh! Norman, panicking, rushes to the sink, turns on the faucet full blast and sticks his hand under the water. This causes a great splashing. 
INT. STUDY - SAME TIME 
Frank peeks up from behind the couch. He's clearly high. With his hands still tied, he struggles to get to his feet. 
INT. STUDY BATHROOM - DAY 
Norman frantically washes his hands. 
OSCAR You cheater! You cheater! You're committing adultery!!! 
ELAINE Calm down. 
OSCAR I'm going to jump right now. 
ELAINE Remember you've got drugs in you. This isn't really happening. Oscar, look at me. She turns to Derek. 
ELAINE (CONT'D) 
(TO DEREK) Get out of here! She pushes him back inside. 
EXT. BACK GARDEN - SAME TIME 
As mourners mill about the lawn we hear: 
OSCAR (O.S.) I'm going to jump. I'm jumping. You're a cheater! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: People gather. around and look up. We only see Oscar from the waist up. ANGLE ON: Oscar. 
OSCAR (CONT'D) I'm going to jump. She's cheating on me! 
ELAINE (O.S.) Oscar, please. Come back here. 
INT. STUDY - DAY 
Ryan, Aaron, Jeff and Norman are as we left them. 
NORMAN There's just no way we can do it. It's impossible. Suddenly there's a knock on the door. Everyone freezes. 
DEREK (O.S.) Norman, it's Derek. Let me in. Everyone freezes. 
RYAN Oh shit. Put him in the bathroom. Aaron and Jeff drag Frank to the bathroom door. 
DEREK (O.S.) Are you in there? Aaron opens the door and we see Uncle Russell still on the toilet. He looks up. 
UNCLE RUSSELL What's that? Aaron slams the door. We can hear Russell's muffled shouting coming from behind the bathroom door. 
AARON Norman!! Why is Uncle Russell on the toilet? 
NORMAN I forgot! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
AARON How could you forget?! What the hell is wrong with you?! Another loud bang on the door. 
DEREK (O.S.) Aaron, open the door. Norman opens the door as Aaron runs over to keep Derek from entering. 
INT. STUDY/CORRIDOR - DAY 
Aaron opens the door an inch. 
AARON What is it? 
DEREK Aaron, where's Norman? 
NORMAN (from behind the door) I'm here. 
DEREK It's Oscar, he went crazy. He's-- Derek realizes that something weird's going on. 
DEREK (CONT'D) What's going on? 
AARON Nothing. Derek puts aside his curiosity for the time being. 
DEREK Look, Oscar's on the roof stark naked. He saw me kissing Elaine and now he's threatening to jump! 
JEFF I've got to go. Jeff rushes to the door. 
RYAN Where are you going? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JEFF I have to go out there. If he jumps, my sister is going to kill me. Jeff rushes out. 
AARON (to Ryan and Norman) Wait here. Aaron follows Jeff, but he does not run. He walks out. 
NORMAN So, what made you decide to get your God on? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
REVEREND DAVIS Look, I'm sorry, I really need to use 
THE PHONE-- 
NORMAN I'd like to make a confession. 
REVEREND DAVIS I'm not a priest. 
NORMAN That's okay, 'cause I'm not Catholic. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Aaron and Ryan get to the coffin and Ryan opens it up. There's an intense moment as they look down at their father in the coffin. They both stop for a moment, speechless. 
RYAN Aaron, we have to do this. Aaron looks up at Ryan and nods his assent. Ryan and Aaron lift up Frank and try their best to put him in the coffin. 
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Norman still blocks the reverend. 
NORMAN What do you think God's favorite color is? 
REVEREND DAVIS 
(ANNOYED) I have no idea. 
NORMAN I'll bet it's blue. The sky's blue. The seas are blue. And the winds blew, too. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Ryan and Aaron are staring at the body. Frank is on his stomach, tops to tails with their father. Aaron looks at it and decides that it's just wrong. 
AARON We can't leave it like that. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Ryan looks down and laughs. 
RYAN In a strange way, this might have been what he wanted. 
AARON Be serious for a second. They begin lifting him again. 
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
Norman is doing his best to keep Reverend Davis at bay. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Aaron and Ryan have swiveled the body around so that Frank is facing upwards. 
RYAN Why do you say I don't take anything seriously? You complain about me all the time, but if I didn't play the bad boy, you couldn't play the martyr. 
(MOCKING) Aaron's so great, Aaron's so right, Aaron's so responsible. (back to normal) Why don't you try laughing and enjoying life once in a while? It might make you a better a writer. 
INT. ENTRY CORRIDOR - DAY 
Norman is still talking to Reverend Davis. She looks like she really doesn't want to be there. 
REVEREND DAVIS Look, I must get to a phone. There's a man on the roof who's going to jump. 
NORMAN I'm addicted to strip clubs. The shoes, the poles, the smell. I just like to take my money and throw it in the air. I like to make it rain. 
EXT. ROOF - DAY 
Elaine is stepping off the fire escape ladder and onto the roof peak. Oscar sits sadly on the roof peak with his back to the crowd. 
ELAINE Oscar... Please don't do this... love you. 
OSCAR Then why were you with him? 
ELAINE I wasn't with him. 
OSCAR Yes, you were! I saw you! 
EXT. BACK GARDEN - CONTINUOUS 
OSCAR Thank you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DUNCAN (O.S.) Elaine! Elaine opens the bathroom door and Duncan enters. Elaine helps Oscar get dressed. 
DUNCAN (CONT'D) 
(TO ELAINE) Thank God you're safe. 
(TO OSCAR) You idiot! What the hell is wrong with you? Stay away from my daughter. 
ELAINE Look, Dad-- 
DUNCAN Elaine, stay out of this. 
ELAINE No, I'm not staying out of this. Remember how I told you we were moving in together? Well, I lied. We're getting married. Duncan is shocked. 
DUNCAN You're what?! 
ELAINE We're getting married. 
DUNCAN Elaine, you don't have to marry him just because you're pregnant. 
ELAINE I'm not marrying him because I'm pregnant. I'm marrying him because I love him. 
DUNCAN How can you love him? He's an idiot. 
ELAINE Dad, this is my life. If you don't like it, too bad. But if you want to keep me and my child in your life, you'd better change your attitude, especially about my husband. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) Elaine exits, taking Oscar with her. 
OSCAR Bye, Dad. They exit. 
EXT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Cynthia walks up to Aaron. 
CYNTHIA Baby, I really think we should start again now. Have you seen Uncle Russell? Aaron remembers where he is and looks at Ryan. They rush off to the study, passing Jeff. Jeff checks his pockets and realizes the pills are gone again. He goes off to find them. 
INT. STUDY - DAY 
Aaron and Ryan enter the study and head toward the closed bathroom door. They open it and find Uncle Russell sitting on the toilet. 
UNCLE RUSSELL What the hell is going on in this place? 
AARON I'm so sorry, Uncle Russell. There was someone on the roof-- 
UNCLE RUSSELL Never mind that. What about that dead body you dragged in here? Aaron and Ryan feign ignorance. 
AARON What dead body? 
UNCLE RUSSELL Don't mess with me. I know a dead body when I see one. I live in a retirement home. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Norman sniffs his fingers, worried. In the background we see Elaine entering the room with Oscar, now dressed, but still looking a bit wired. People respond with scattered applause and congratulations. Derek walks over and joins Norman. 
DEREK Did you hear that? She's having a kid! Derek looks at Norman who's looking sort of distant. 
DEREK (CONT'D) How's your skin thing? 
NORMAN Oh that... It's probably nothing. I'm more worried about Hepatitis C after having Uncle Russell's shit in my mouth. I think I'm feeling yellow. Norman touches his skin as he walks away, leaving Derek confused. ANGLE ON: Jeff frantically looking for the pill bottle. He gives up and sits in a chair. ANGLE ON: Ryan is wheeling Uncle Russell into the room as Aaron moves to his seat. 
UNCLE RUSSELL I'm telling you I saw the guy. He was dead! 
RYAN I know you did, Russell. We all did. 
UNCLE RUSSELL No! In the bathroom. Ryan offers a look to the other mourners indicating that Uncle Russell's a bit mad and shouldn't be listened to. ANGLE ON: Michelle comes over to Aaron. 
AARON I can't believe what a nightmare today has been. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MICHELLE I don't know. It's been sort of exciting. Aaron looks at her.

INT. HAL'S BATHROOM 
Oliver enters the bathroom and flushes bottle after bottle of pills and liquids down the toilet. Next he struggles as he looks over the old toothbrush, hairbrush, all the bottles and tubes besides the sink. He stares for a beat, then throws them all away.

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY 
Camera follow's Oliver down a long corridor. 
OLIVER (CONT'D) Now, somewhat arbitrarily, you are considered very cute by us humans, and we keep breeding you not to chase foxes, but to be cute, and we put you in movies and television shows, and you, you're chasing tennis balls cause there as close to a fox as you're going to get. Arthur stays by Oliver's side.

INT. HAL'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 
In the dark I.C.U. room, Hal is still attached to many I.V.s, Oliver is helping Hal look at a book of Japanese rock gardens with a flashlight. 
OLIVER Want me to read this? I found it in your books. 
HAL Yeah, alright. Give me the flashlight. Oliver opens it, they look at a few pages together, photos of serene gardens. 
OLIVER Nice. 
HAL Oh, that's nice. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Hal keeps peeking at a bouquet of flowers in the corner of the room. Hal takes the flashlight from Oliver and guides it to the flowers. 
OLIVER Oh, Andy brought those for you. 
HAL Oh, yeah? Hal continues to direct the light across the room, we follow the circle of light as it moves a cross a wall landing on a painting. 
HAL Oh, who did that painting? 
OLIVER Well, I don't know. Its just a painting on the wall. Hal continues exploring, Oliver's enjoying his father's curiosity, he lands on some photos displayed on the table. 
HAL A--, and these? 
OLIVER They're just photos, Pop. 
HAL But how do they relate to the exhibit? 
OLIVER They're just personal photos. They're not art. Hal slowly moves the flashlight up the wall, across the ceiling to a strange assortment of fire detectors, sprinklers, sensors, all laid out against the acoustic tile ceiling. Hal points up. Oliver looks for a beat, then... 
OLIVER Uh, well that's the water sprinkler thing. 
HAL Well, its beautiful. 
OLIVER What is? 
HAL Putting the Japanese gardens there. It's just beautiful. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Oliver looks from the ceiling to the rock garden book. The ceiling and the gardens look the same. Oliver is moved by Hal's confusion. ANDY, 45-years-old, physical, boyish, storms into the room. 
ANDY Hal. 
HAL Andy! Andy gets on the bed opposite Oliver. He gives Hal a big kiss on the lips. Hal glows. Oliver backs away slowly. Andy picks up Hal's hand, turns it palm up and presses his face into it. 
ANDY I brought something for you. Oliver watches from outside the room as Andy excitedly pulls a portable tape player out of his bag. 
ANDY We made a recording for you. 
HAL Oh, God. Andy pushes play, on the recording we hear Andy's voice: 
ANDY ON TAPE This is for our friend Hal Fields. Hal. We love you. We hear voices HOOTING, and then large FIREWORKS, LAUGHTER and CLAPPING. Oliver watches his father's happiness from a distance.

INT. OLIVER'S OFFICE 
CU on Oliver's hands drawing bright streaming colors of the fireworks. LATER: Oliver get's to his real work, pulling out a few 8X10 photos of a band "The Sads". There are some instructions on record company letterhead - he is to do an album design for their new record - they want him to draw portraits of the three members. Oliver begins to do quick portraits of them based on the photo. 
LONG-HAIRED MAN Well, I didn't ask for this. Who would ask for this? This color. This nose. This cheek, this chin. You know, this is my life. This isn't a story. This isn't a joke... Oliver is playing along, but he's really not emotionally ready for this party. He feels very far away. 
OLIVER Yeah. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LONG-HAIRED MAN I'm so glad you came, Doc. Just really good to get this stuff off my chest. 
OLIVER (in Freud accent) I'm sorry. Our time is up, uh... for this week. Thank you for coming in. The witch moves on. Oliver sits with Arthur in his lap, alone, lost in all this joviality. We see that the woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg is watching him. Just as Oliver is about to get up, she plops herself down onto the couch, ready for her session. 
OLIVER V.O. Oh, I was just- I was gonna take a break, actually. She pulls out a writing pad, oblivious. Oliver can tell she's not going to give it up. 
OLIVER (back in accent) Well, I guess we should start with your mother. The woman writes on her notepad and shows it to Oliver: "Never had one." 
OLIVER Well then your father. She mimes shooting herself in the head and dying. 
OLIVER I don't understand. You can't talk? Is it a mental problem? Do you need analysis? She writes on her pad: "I have laryngitis" 
OLIVER That's a physical problem. She smiles at him, looks at him a little too long, Oliver is more and more pulled in by her playfulness - she writes: "Why are you at a party if you're sad?" CU on Oliver, surprised and impressed by her observation. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
OLIVER I was doing such a good job of hiding it. How could you tell? Ethel holds up her notebook. She has drawn TWO EYES. Oliver's taken by her. 
OLIVER Clearly, I'm gonna need a drink. You? She smiles and nods. 
OLIVER You, stay here, yeah? Oliver moves to-- 
INT KITCHEN Elliot and Shauna are deeply engaged in conversation with someone dressed as a pickle and someone dressed as much less colorful chicken. 
ELLIOTT No, its just not a natural color for a chicken. 
SHAUNA No. 
ELLIOTT (motioning to Shauna's 
COSTUME) And look, you see what happens when you free yourself from the cage, walk away from the factory. 
SHAUNA You just have no real color. 
YOU'RE LIKE-- Oliver slips past, hands Arthur to Elliot. He scoops ice from the bucket and starts filling two cups. 
ELLIOTT Hey, hey. 
SHAUNA 
(COUNTING CUPS) Uh-oh, one. Uh-oh, two. 
ELLIOTT Two drinks. 
SHAUNA What does that me--, one, two. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ELLIOTT Well that's two, two people. 
SHAUNA Two people. A girl and a guy? 
ELLIOTT Hopefully. 
SHAUNA Yeah, wow, making moves. Oliver leaves Arthur in Elliott's arms. 
OLIVER Watch him OK? Oliver begins to leave his drinks. We see his POV of the woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg waiting on the couch. Oliver slips into one of his memories...

(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: DOCTOR LONG (cont'd) With the already weakened state of your heart and lungs... As Dr. Long talks about treatments, Oliver drifts back from the conversation, slowly retreating to a window in the far corner, as we continue to hear Dr. Long speak, we see Oliver's thoughts, fixating on "a mass about the size of a 
QUARTER" 
WE HEAR: 
DR. LONG (O.S.) (CONT'D) ... Surgery isn't possible given its location. We can start radiation treatments and see if you're strong enough for Chemo. You will be able to go home. 
WE SEE: 
SHOT OF A QUARTER ON BLACK 
SHOT OF TWO DIMES AND A NICKEL 
SHOT OF 5 NICKELS. 
SHOT OF 25 PENNIES. We cut back to Hal's face, stoically digesting the news. 
DOCTOR LONG Do you have any questions? 
HAL No. Thank you. As the doctor leaves. Oliver takes his father's hand. 
OLIVER I'm sorry. 
HAL Well, let's not rush out and tell everyone. 
OLIVER Andy? 
HAL No need to get him up a tree. Hal takes a moment and composes himself. In his eyes we can see that he knows there is an end to his life. 
HAL (CONT'D) Can you read me something? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Hal hands Oliver his Advocate magazine, he begins to read from "Tough Guys Do Dance."

GEORGIA (CONT'D) C'mon. 
INT. CHILDHOOD HALLWAY - DAY 
They stand in front of his bedroom door. 
GEORGIA When you feel bad, you go into a room and scream - loud as you want, for a minute or two, then it's out of you. It's called catharsis. She opens the door, pushes him inside, and closes the door. 
INT. OLIVER'S CHILDHOOD ROOM - DAY 
Young Oliver pauses, confused in his room. He doesn't scream.

GEORGIA Oliver, stop it. 
Oliver stands up bored, Georgia's in the connecting bathroom getting ready to go out. 
OLIVER This music's old. 
GEORGIA It's black, black music is the deepest cause they suffered the most, them and the Jews. Oliver plops down on the bed, listening to her. 
GEORGIA In my next life I'm gonna marry a good hot blooded Jew - someone full of emotion. 
OLIVER I'm Jewish right? Georgia comes and sits with him, caresses his hair as she talks with him. 
GEORGIA AT 50 You're a quarter, I'm a half, your father's none. He has the least emotions, You'll have more emotions than him, but I'll have the most emotions. She likes that she has the most emotions. They head out.

GEORGIA What? You're not allowed to interact with the art?

OLIVER Camisole? Anna laughs. 
ANNA You don't know what a camisole is? 
OLIVER I was brought up by these animals and they didn't like questions. They're both smiling now.

ANNA I used to love hotels. But now I'm always in a new apartment or... in another hotel somewhere. 
OLIVER How do you keep hold of friends... or boyfriends? 
ANNA It makes it very easy to end up alone - to leave people. 
OLIVER You can stay in the same place and still find ways to leave people. She reaches up with her hand, their fingers intertwine. 
ANNA You are like that? Its what you do? Oliver nods yes. They know each other much better than either one knew.

INT. OLIVER'S OFFICE - DAY 
GINSBERG'S READING CONTINUES OVER: Oliver flips through a mock-up he made for "The Sads" - it's all the happy faces from 1950's advertising that we saw in the last scene. One face per-panel. LATER: the three members of "The Sads" and a RECORD COMPANY REP arrive. Jelly Roll Morton piano plays, we see but do not hear the meeting take place. The Sads look at the designs, which include many of the "History Of Sadness" drawings we have seen now in CD cover format - and no portraits of the band. It's clear that The Sads are not into Oliver's work. CUT TO: After the meeting, the RECORD COMPANY REP talks to Oliver alone. 
RECORD COMPANY LADY Just do the portrait of them, it's an album cover, right? That's what they want. Yeah? Oliver's very disappointed but polite.

OLIVER Hey, I don't have a problem with gay guys. 
ANDY Have you ever had sex with a man? 
OLIVER No. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ANDY I heard that if a man hasn't had sex with another man, he's always afraid of gay men. You know, they're a threat. Oliver's blown away by the logic. 
OLIVER I don't know Andy. 
ANDY I didn't want you to feel threatened, I don't want to have sex with you. What I do, most people wouldn't even call it sex. Andy's relieved he got this off his chest, all tension is relieved for him, Oliver is just confused. 
OLIVER Okay, okay. 
ANDY Hey... Andy gives Oliver a big sweaty hug. Oliver leaves. 
INT. HAL'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Oliver enters as Hal's finishing the dishes. 
OLIVER I couldn't tell him.

OLIVER He's that bad? She picks up the phone, and gestures for Oliver to pick up the line next to him. 
ANNA (CONT'D) I'll be my dad, you be me. 
OLIVER 
OK. 
ANNA (In a deep man's voice) Honey? She gestures again, Oliver picks up the phone on his side of the bed. Anna turns away, he can only see her back across the bed. He turns away too.

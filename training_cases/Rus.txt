1   EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY                                   1 
Dark clouds passing overhead. 
The bad weather that has hovered over the Eifel mountains, (in Germany), the past three days is on it's way out.. 
2   AN EYE FLICKERS - WIDE OPEN - STARING INTENTLY                    2 
A pupil dilates and contracts in the light. The eye stares. Blinks. Thinks. Making evaluations.. 
3   EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY                                   3 
The first rays of sunshine break through. The voices of international TV commentators in different languages. 
COMMENTATORS ...in places the track is still dangerously wet, but following a drivers meeting the decision has been taken. The race is going ahead... 
4   INT. FERRARI - DAY                                                4 
The eye belongs to a 27 year old Formula 1 RACING DRIVER wearing a fireproof balaclava... 
Highly intelligent, he also happens to be World Champion. His name is painted on the side of his Ferrari. NIKI LAUDA. 
NIKI (V/O) My grandfather always said history is cruel and reductive and no matter how long we live, or how much we achieve - we are remembered for very little. So make sure it's the right things. 
NIKI stares up at the clouds. His eyelids flicker. Thinking. Agonizing. Wrestling with an all important decision... 
Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry? Should he be using slicks or wets? 
5   EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY                                          5 
We widen to find ourselves on the starting grid of a major Grand Prix. All around us... 
(CONTINUED) 5   CONTINUED:                                                       5 
Engines scream into life as DRIVERS start their cars. An OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, "One Minute"... 
Deafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently. 
NIKI This is bullshit. We have no control over our legacy. We cannot choose what we are remembered for... 
A Ferrari MECHANIC rushes towards NIKI, and shouts in Italian above the noise, (we see sub-titles)... 
MECHANIC Mass usa slicks. Le vuoi cambiare anche tu? (Mass is going on slicks. You want to change?) 
NIKI looks in his wing-mirror back to see a red McLaren, white helmet, number 12, several rows behind him. A team of MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres. 
NIKI Otherwise I wouldn't be remembered for my rivalry with this asshole. And the 1976 season. 
NIKI then looks over at the car in pole position beside him. Another McLaren, but with number 11, and a Union Jack... 
NIKI What about Hunt? Has he changed? 
MECHANIC No, he's going on wets. 
The car in pole position: JAMES HUNT, surrounded by TV crews, mechanics, girlfriends, hangers-on.. 
The Maclaren team is less than half the size of Ferrari's, but HUNT makes up for this with magnetism. The rock star of F1. 
NIKI's face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival's glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava, flirting with several hot-looking GIRLS.. 
NIKI I don't know why it became such a big thing. We were just drivers. Busting each other's balls. To me this is perfectly normal. But other people saw it differently. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 5   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   5 
NIKI (cont√≠d) That whatever it was between us went deeper. And changed us both somehow. Forever. 
NIKI stares, then... 
NIKI Be, allora usiamo anche noi quells da bagnato. (Then we go on wets, too.) 
The ten-second board is held up. 
NIKI pulls down his visor...as he and HUNT's eyes meet for a split-second, eyes staring... 
NIKI selects second gear for the wet track and revs the engine. The dashboard needle climbs through 8000, 9000, 10000 RPM. 
NIKI Maybe that explains the state of mind I was in. And why it happened. The other thing I'm remembered for. (a beat) On August 1st, that same year... 
CAPTION: "AUGUST 1st, 1976". 
9   INT. HOSPITAL A&E UNIT - (ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY) - DAY           9 
We're in a busy hospital A&E unit. Noise. Crowds. A regular Saturday late afternoon. The phone continues to ring.. 
Finally, an attractive station NURSE in her 20's, run-off-her- feet, breathlessly picks up the phone. 
NURSE Emergency... 
She covers her ears, straining to hear, listening to what is being said. Then her expression changes... 
NURSE Okay...standing by! 
The NURSE hangs up...then calls out to her NURSE and DOCTOR colleagues... 
NURSE That was the race-track..! There's been an accident..! A driver's been injured and is on his way in..! 
Instantly the atmosphere changes. A hive of activity as DOCTORS and NURSES prepare themselves for a major trauma... 
All PATIENTS with minor injuries are cleared out of the way. 
The NURSE rings upstairs to the operating theatres and consultant surgeons, telling them to stand by... 
CAPTION: "EIGHTY-EIGHT RACES EARLIER" 
Swing doors open, and a pair of shoeless, BARE FEET walks through and into the accident and emergency unit. 
Camera tilts up a pair of long legs in white racing overalls...to reveal a tall, good-looking driver, JAMES HUNT, (mid 20's), tanned, athletic, surfer long blonde hair... 
A man about whom a word comes to mind one would rarely use to describe an Englishman. SEXY. 
Blood trickles from his nose, there is bruising to his lip and the formation (already) of a nasty black eye, but make no mistake. He rocks. Drop-dead gorgeous.. 
(CONTINUED) 9    CONTINUED:                                                       9 
JAMES I think the racetrack telephoned ahead that I was coming? Hunt? James Hunt..? 
JAMES notices all the NURSES staring.. 
JAMES What's the matter? No one seen a spot of blood before? 
NURSE Are you all right? 
JAMES Absolutely fine. 
10   INT. A&E UNIT - DAY                                              10 
The attractive NURSE is examining JAMES, opening his overalls, checking for wounds, cuts and bruises... 
NURSE We all thought you'd been in an accident. 
JAMES I have. If you call a friendly disagreement with another driver an accident. 
NURSE What did you disagree about? 
JAMES None of your business. Ouch. 
NURSE Sorry. 
JAMES His wife. 
NURSE That's going to need a couple of stitches. It's a nasty cut. 
JAMES It was a nasty blow. Done with a bloody spanner. 
NURSE Why? What did you do? 
(CONTINUED) 10   CONTINUED:                                                      10 
JAMES Nothing! Only what she begged me to do. 
The NURSE notices bruising on JAMES's chest... 
NURSE Which was..? 
She examines him, testing his ribs for fractures, his chest.. 
JAMES looks up. Their eyes meet.. 
JAMES Be happy to show you if you like. 
11   INT. JAMES'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  11 
`Crash', the door flies open as JAMES and the NURSE stumble through, mid-embrace, tearing at one another's clothes... 
The apartment is basic. Cramped. Messy. Like that of a poor student. Ashtrays filled with half-smoked joints. Empty beer cans. A toaster. A kettle. A stereo. A cage containing two budgerigars. 
A mattress on the floor. 
JAMES Uuuurrrrrkkkkkkggghghhhh. 
The NURSE is shocked to hear a dreadful watery vomiting sound. She sees JAMES bent over behind the truck... 
HESKETH Nothing to be worried about! Does it before every race! Good sign, actually. Means he's stoked! 
14   EXT. PADDOCK - SAME TIME                                         14 
JAMES continues vomiting... 
JAMES (V/O) There's a lie that all drivers tell themselves. "Death is something that happens to other people." That's how you find the courage to get in the car in the first place... 
JAMES emerges, wiping his mouth... 
HESKETH All right, Superstar? 
JAMES Never better, Patron. 
JAMES (V/O) Because bad things only happen to others, right? 
HESKETH Have a gargle with this. 
(CONTINUED) 14   CONTINUED:                                                     14 
JAMES takes a quick swig of the champagne...gargles, then swallows, puts on his balaclava... 
JAMES (V/O) Problem is deep down you know that's a lie. That it could happen to you at any moment. 
HESKETH Quick toke of this... 
HESKETH passes over a joint, which JAMES inhales, taking a huge lungful from.... 
JAMES (V/O) So how do you make that terror go away? Well, booze is good for that. And wacky baccy. But better than everything else is...sex. 
JAMES goes to the NURSE...and kisses her full on the lips, then puts on his helmet, and athletically vaults into the car. 
JAMES hits the ignition, and a deafening high-pitched SCREAM as the engine starts... 
HESKETH Ahhhh! What music! They could never have predicted it, those pioneers that invented the automobile that it would possess us like this, in our imaginations, our dreams. Nursie, men love women...but even more than that, men love CARS... 
15   EXT. PADDOCK - CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY                              15 
JAMES notices another driver (NIKI LAUDA), his car already unloaded, (number 35) and mechanics working on it.. 
JAMES Who's that? 
DOC He's new. Some German. 
BUBBLES (corrects) Austrian. 
JAMES Is there a difference? 
(CONTINUED) 15   CONTINUED:                                                     15 
JAMES looks over. On the side of the car, painted markings, in the form of a signature, "Niki Lauda". 
JAMES All bloody Goosesteppers. 
16   EXT. RACE TRACK - CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY                           16 
JAMES is neck and neck with NIKI. They go into a corner. 
NIKI gets there first. Up ahead though, approaching the second bend...JAMES sees the tiniest, slimmest crack to overtake. No right-minded driver would risk it. Only a suicidal maniac. 
Which just happens to describe JAMES perfectly.. 
JAMES goes for it. Daringly. Brilliantly. And forces NIKI to slam on his brakes to prevent a certain crash... 
17   EXT. PITS - SAME TIME                                            17 
HESKETH, BUBBLES, DOC and the NURSE watch from the sidelines... 
BUBBLES That move was suicide! 
HESKETH It was also quite brilliant!! God he's got balls!! 
18   EXT. RACE TRACK - DAY                                            18 
JAMES carries on driving. Flat out. 
But on the flat, NIKI suddenly comes out of nowhere. As if his car has 50 bhp more. 
And overtakes JAMES. NIKI begins to pull away. And has the Englishman beaten.. 
JAMES sees red mist...and in an act of do-or-die vengeful madness, JAMES goes into a corner far too fast... 
...yanks his steering wheel. And outrageously shunts NIKI's car. An unforgivable act of unsportsmanlike vindictiveness. 
...and in a move that he knows will rupture the family for ever, NIKI gets to his feet.. 
NIKI Fine. Keep your money. Don't invest in me. But when I'm World Champion, and I have the trophy, and my name is not just on the back pages, but on the front too, you will regret it. 
NIKI walks out, the old man's insults ringing in his ears... 
GRANDFATHER You dare sit at my table and lecture me on what I will or won't regret? Get out! Impertinent wretch! Consider yourself disowned! 
23   INT. RAIFEISENKASSE - BANK - DAY                                23 
NIKI is in a meeting with visibly concerned BANKERS and LAWYERS. They speak in German... 
BANKER Another loan? Herr Lauda, you still haven't repaid the other... 
BANKER 2 Three.. 
BANKER Totalling millions of Schillings. Plus your Grandfather called to inform us he will no longer be offering security. 
NIKI I know. There is no room for failure. I understand that. 
NIKI (V/O) But I was still a Lauda... 
24   INT. NIKI'S CAR/ ROAD TO VIENNA AIRPORT - DAY                   24 
NIKI is driving his car. Beside him, is the attache case on his lap. His car passes under a motorway sign reading "Flughafen". (Airport)... 
NIKI (V/O) ...which meant I was still a businessman above everything else. 
25   EXT. VIENNA AIRPORT - DAY                                       25 
A private jet. A balding, blazered Englishman in late middle- age (LOUIS STANLEY), owner of BRM racing, disembarks onto the tarmac... 
NIKI (V/O) It just so happens that the business I deal in is speed. 
26   INT. VIENNA AIRPORT - CAFE                                      26 
NIKI sits with LOUIS STANLEY in an airport cafe. 
Contracts are open on the table. NIKI is signing. LOUIS STANLEY is counter-signing... 
(CONTINUED) 26   CONTINUED:                                                     26 
STANLEY In return for your money you get a car, mechanics and a place on the team. Plus fifty per cent of starting fees and bonuses for podium finishes. 
NIKI Who's the number one driver? 
STANLEY Clay Regazzoni and you will defer to him at all times. 
NIKI takes out his cheque book and pen. He looks up... 
NIKI Why would I defer to him if I am paying his wages? 
NIKI writes the cheque. STANLEY's smile fades.. 
STANLEY Because he's a proven winner at the highest level, a good guy, and someone who quite frankly, could teach you a thing or two. 
NIKI ignores this, continues scrutinizing the contract... 
NIKI OK. There is one clause missing. 
STANLEY The one about mechanics' exclusivity? Sorry. We have a cardinal rule at BRM. All information is shared between ALL our drivers.. 
NIKI And I made it perfectly clear that my mechanics work for me. No one else. This is something I cannot sign. 
NIKI takes back the cheque. STANLEY stares... 
STANLEY All right. I'll have the lawyers amend it. 
NIKI While you're at it you can tell them to amend the clause for podium finishes. Podium is first THREE places, not just wins. 
(CONTINUED) 26   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  26 
NIKI puts the cheque in his attache case. Snaps it shut, taking it with him.. 
NIKI You'll get the money on signature, as agreed. See you at winter testing. 
NIKI gets to his feet, and leaves. STANLEY watches the attache case disappear. 
STANLEY If that little git drives half as well as he negotiates, we're going to be fine. 
CUT TO: 
27   OMITTED                                                          27 
28   INT. AWARD CEREMONY - NIGHT                                      28 
An awards ceremony is in progress. The room is thick with cigar and cigarette smoke. A presenter on stage, wearing black tie... 
NIKI Thank you. 
A silence. The RECEPTIONIST continues with her work. NIKI watches her, unsure what to say, (small-talk not his forte)... 
NIKI Worked here long? 
AGNES Excuse me? 
NIKI Just wondered if you've worked here long? 
AGNES Almost eight years. 
NIKI That long? And they didn't promote you yet? 
AGNES Yes, several times. I am the AGNES. Agnes Bonnet. If you're looking for the receptionist, she's on her lunch. 
NIKI is thrown. Feels humiliated. A total jerk. He is about to say something when the door opens, and... 
Two other F1 DRIVERS walk in.. 
(CONTINUED) 30   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  30 
Glamorous, long-haired, tanned, fashionable - like rock stars, they talk effortlessly and flirt confidently with AGNES. 
What are you doing answering the phones? New haircut! Like it. What have you done to the weather? 
They make her laugh. And smile. 
NIKI feels invisible. Embarrassed. Awkward. Inadequate. He gets to his feet. And goes to the car that has come to collect him. 
As he goes, (unseen by NIKI), AGNES watches him. Ignoring the other DRIVERS. Intrigued. 
He's different. Interesting. Intense. Intelligent eyes. 
31   EXT. BRM WORKSHOPS - DAY                                         31 
The car pulls up outside the workshops. NIKI gets out of the car, and is greeted by LOUIS STANLEY, and the BRM team... 
STANLEY Niki, let me introduce you to our number 1 driver, Clay Regazzoni..and our number 2, Jean Pierre Beltoise.. 
The intimidating, muscular, moustachioed figure of CLAY REGAZZONI, the Swiss driver. NIKI and CLAY shake hands. 
STANLEY And these are your mechanics, reporting exclusively to you. As per contract... 
REGAZZONI, BELTOISE and STANLEY exchange looks as NIKI shakes hands, ad-libbed greetings with his MECHANICS. 
MECHANIC You want to see the car? 
32   INT/EXT. BRM WORKSHOPS - DAY                                     32 
NIKI is led into the workshop to see a red and white Marlboro sponsored car, number 21, with a tall air-intake duct just above the driver's helmet... 
MECHANIC There she is. The P160.. 
NIKI Same as Regazzoni's? 
(CONTINUED) 32   CONTINUED:                                                     32 
MECHANIC Identical in every detail. 
NIKI scrutinizes the car... 
NIKI She looks heavy. How much does she weigh? 
MECHANIC 540 kilos. 
NIKI That's crazy. Why so heavy..? 
MECHANIC It's a 3 litre, V12 engine, that thing weighs 190k alone. 
NIKI What horsepower are you getting out of it? 
MECHANIC 
NIKI Not enough. Needs to be 500 and the engine needs to be 20k lighter. 
MECHANIC We already tried... 
NIKI Did you use magnesium parts? 
The MECHANICS look at one another skeptically... 
33   INT. BRM WORKSHOPS - NIGHT                                      33 
Shooting from above: 
The entire car has been stripped to a thousand pieces. Now spread all over the workshop floor. 
CLAY REGAZZONI emerges from testing his car. Still amazed by the improved performance. Talking to his MECHANICS. In awe. 
He removes his helmet, then stops. 
In the distance he sees NIKI talking to AGNES the attractive TRACK MANAGER. They are clearly hitting it off.. 
40   INT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - WORKSHOPS - LOCKER-ROOM - DAY         40 
NIKI is in the showers, then getting changed for his date with AGNES. He is about to go, when he stops, and sees... 
CLAY REGAZZONI getting undressed, looking at NIKI. CLAY speaks English with an Italian accent.. 
REGAZZONI I know what you're going to say. That it's none of my business... 
NIKI What? 
REGAZZONI If it's the Track Manager you're taking on your date tonight? 
NIKI immediately becomes defensive... 
NIKI It's none of your business. 
REGAZZONI Okay, but if you want my advice...I'd let this one go. I'm not questioning your taste. She's a great girl. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 40   CONTINUED:                                                      40 
REGAZZONI (cont√≠d) But Agnes's last boyfriend was a British Formula 2 driver, who has a reputation for two things. For being a suicidal jerk on the track, and for going all night, and all day afterwards...and all night again in bed. He's an OK driver, but an IMMORTAL fuck, apparently. I don't know about you, but that's not an act I'd like to follow. (shrugs) But if that doesn't bother you... 
NIKI What's his name? The driver? 
REGAZZONI Hunt. James Hunt. 
NIKI stares. Can hardly believe it. 
REGAZZONI See? You share information, I share information. 
CLAY slaps NIKI on his back, and goes into the showers.. 
REGAZZONI That's what team-mates are for. 
NIKI (quiet/defeated) Thanks. 
41   EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT                                          41 
A restaurant in Marseilles. Through the window we can see AGNES, the attractive TRACK MANAGER sitting at a table alone. Waiting for NIKI. 
Reverse angle to reveal: 
42   INT. NIKI'S CAR/ MARSEILLES STREET - SAME TIME                   42 
NIKI is sitting in a car across the street. He stares at AGNES in the restaurant. Then starts his car, and drives off. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
43   EXT. EASTON NESTON - HESKETH RACING HQ - DAY                     43 
Easton Neston. Set in 3,300 acres, one of England's great country houses. Home to the Fermor-Hesketh family since 1700. 
JAMES and a new GIRLFRIEND drive up the gravel drive in his anything but grandiose Mini. It splutters to a stop, just in time. 
They are greeted by uniformed STAFF who take his tatty bags from his filthy car. 
44   INT. HESKETH RACING WORKSHOPS - EASTON NESTON - DAY              44 
The Hesketh Racing workshops, situated in the converted stables on the estate. HESKETH leads a blindfolded JAMES in... 
HESKETH Keep them closed...! Wait for it, wait for it... 
HESKETH removes JAMES's blindfold... 
HESKETH There! What do you say? 
JAMES opens his eyes to see a gorgeous F1 racing car, plain white, no stickers... 
HESKETH Isn't she a beauty? The March 731. Converted by the brilliant Doc..! 
DOC POSTLETHWAITE takes a modest bow. JAMES shakes hands with everyone, including his brother, (and manager), PETER.. 
JAMES She is a beauty. But...haven't you made a mistake? 
HESKETH What? 
JAMES That's not a Formula 2 car. She's F1. 
HESKETH She is, Superstar. Why? Because I got together with the beancounters, and it turns out that the economics of F1 are not so significantly different to the economics of Formula 2... 
BUBBLES clears his throat, dutifully bites his tongue.. 
JAMES What was the description? 
SUZY Mostly positive in terms of appearance. Negative only in terms of character. I've been told to avoid you. 
JAMES By whom? 
SUZY Alex. He says you're a bad boy. 
(CONTINUED) 68   CONTINUED: (2)                                              68 
JAMES Was. Not any more. New me very professional. Early to bed. Early to rise. All very dull. 
SUZY Really? 
JAMES Round-the-clock work, practise and focus. Tedious, but apparently the only way to vin against ze Goosestepper.. 
SUZY Is that what you were doing when you came in? 
JAMES Visualization techniques. Memorizing the circuit, in this case Monaco, which is next up. Eyes closed, know your way round in your sleep... (a beat) I know...I've always been a great believer in getting there on the day, putting the old foot down and playing chicken with everyone else. 
SUZY laughs.. 
JAMES But they don't want me to do that anymore...they want my body like a temple. My mind like Monk. 
SUZY And your soul? Your heart? 
JAMES What does that mean? 
SUZY You can't be so disciplined in all areas of your life, can you..? 
JAMES They want me to stop messing around, get married and settle down with the next nice girl I meet. They think it would be good for me. 
SUZY What do you think? 
(CONTINUED) 68   CONTINUED: (3)                                                  68 
JAMES Sounds bloody awful. 
SUZY laughs again... 
JAMES But since they're right about most things, they're probably right about that, too. 
JAMES looks SUZY up and down... 
JAMES You don't fancy getting married, do you? 
69   EXT. BROMPTON ORATORY CHURCH - LONDON - DAY                      69 
The sound of ringing bells. London's grandest Catholic church in the heart of Knightsbridge.. 
70   OMITTED                                                          70 
71   EXT. BROMPTON ORATORY CHURCH - DAY                               71 
JAMES and SUZY, top hat and tails, flowing white wedding dress, looking ravishing, emerge from the church. 
JAMES and SUZY fall into a passionate, sexy embrace for the paparazzi cameras. Loud cheers go up, led by HESKETH and BUBBLES. 
They make their way to the waiting convoy of cars... 
On his way: JAMES spots a serious-faced HESKETH and DOC POSTLETHWAITE in conversation with some Formula 1 types in the crowd.. 
SUZY is pulled away for photos. Clearly a bigger star even than JAMES. JAMES turns to BUBBLES, indicates HESKETH... 
JAMES What's up? 
BUBBLES Nothing. I don't want to ruin your day. 
BUBBLES stares, then reluctantly...

BUBBLES It seems your revenge against the Goosestepper might have to wait a little longer than you'd hoped. (a beat) He's just been signed by Ferrari. 
JAMES WHAT??? But that's the best team in the world. They could have ANYONE. Did he pay his way in there, too? 
BUBBLES Apparently they took back Regazzoni and he insisted they give Lauda a trial. Thinks he's a genius. Setting up the cars... 
JAMES stares...then is pulled away to pose in photographs with SUZY and her FAMILY. 
72   EXT. FIORANO - NORTHERN ITALY - DAY                              72

Closed circuit television, with 10 cameras and a complex track timing system and computers.... 
NIKI watches. Then turns to walk away. As he goes, the front door opens... 
And a beautiful dark-haired woman (MARLENE) emerges loading several BAGS into a car. Brunette, tan. Wearing a white dress. 
NIKI Are you leaving? 
MARLENE Yes. 
NIKI Can you give me a lift to the nearest town? Anywhere with a train station. 
MARLENE Sure. Nearest town is half an hour's drive. Get in. 
77   OMITTED                                                          77

The car drives. The radio plays. Marlene sings along. NIKI can't help noticing something. He turns down the music. MARLENE's smile fades.. 
MARLENE What are you doing? 
(CONTINUED) 78   CONTINUED:                                            78 
NIKI You hear that noise when you accelerate? 
MARLENE No. 
NIKI Your drive belt is loose. 
MARLENE My what? 
NIKI Alternator. And when you brake, your foot goes all the way down. Means there's air in the system. 
MARLENE Anything else? 
NIKI No. Apart from the rear brakes are imbalanced. The front right wheel is flat, and it feels like a crack in the engine block...which explains why you're drifting so much. 
MARLENE How can you tell? 
NIKI My ass. 
MARLENE What? 
NIKI God gave me an OK mind, but a really good ass, which can feel everything in a car. 
MARLENE You don't know what you're talking about. The car is fine. And it just had a service a week ago. 
NIKI Not a good one. 
MARLENE A very good one. From a proper garage. It cost a fortune. This car is good as new. Relax. 
79   EXT. MOTORWAY - HARD SHOULDER - DAY                             79 
White smoke pours from the engine. The car has broken down. Bonnet up. NIKI has tried fixing it, but to no avail. 
NIKI has a fan belt in his hand, but it's all but disintegrated under the heat of the over-worked engine. 
NIKI's hands are covered in oil. He is pushing a pen into a large crack in the engine, slick with oil and grease. 
NIKI Nothing I can do here. The car needs a garage. 
MARLENE I'm sorry. You're not in a hurry, are you? 
NIKI No. As long as I'm back in Maranello by Monday morning. 
NIKI walks out into the road. Sticks out his thumb... 
MARLENE So who are you anyway? 
MARLENE breaks into GERMAN...(we see sub-titles)... 
MARLENE You're from Vienna, aren't you. We can speak German. How do you know Curd? 
NIKI Who's Curd? 
MARLENE Curd Jurgens. The actor. It's his house. He is, or was until yesterday, my boyfriend. I must have been mad! There is something very attractive about an older man when they behave like one. But when they behave like a frightened child.. 
MARLENE gets to her feet... 
MARLENE C'mon, let me do this. Otherwise we'll never get out of here. We're in Italy, after all. 
MARLENE indicates that NIKI should take a back seat, hitches up her skirt, showing long, tanned legs.. 
(CONTINUED) 79   CONTINUED:                                                      79 
SSSCCCREEEEEEEEECCCCCHHHHHHH!!!!! 
Immediately a passing car screeches to a halt, then reverses noisily to pull level. MARLENE smiles at NIKI... 
Commentators note the improvement in JAMES's technique, maturity and performance. But then, "Puff", a plume of smoke comes out of JAMES's engine. The engine has blown... 
Immediately JAMES loses speed, and NIKI sails past, overtaking effortlessly. Taking the chequered flag. 
Television commentary in various languages tells us: NIKI LAUDA has become world champion... 
82   EXT. FERRARI PITS/USA GP TRACK SIDE - DAY                        82 
NIKI's car pulls in, to be mobbed by jubilant MECHANICS as he gets out of his car, removing his helmet, embraced by a delighted LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO...

...then falling into a passionate kiss with MARLENE... 
Champion of the World, he is immediately swallowed up by REPORTERS who are demanding interviews in Italian, German, English... 
83   EXT. USA GP/PADDOCK - DAY                                       83 
An impromptu party in the paddock area. The victor's garland still round his neck, proudly holding the FIA World Champion trophy, his hair matted with champagne, NIKI passes through the crowds, accepting everyone's congratulations.. 
He runs into JAMES, who's in bare feet as usual. MARLENE is pulled away to talk to someone else.. 
JAMES Congratulations. 
NIKI Thank you. 
JAMES Though with a car like that, the rest of us never stood a chance... 
NIKI Maybe the fact the car is so good might have something to do with me. 
JAMES You're still in a Ferrari. And I'm still in a Hesketh. On equal terms, the way it was in Formula 3, I'd beat you, and you know it. 
NIKI Never. You might get lucky and win one race. Maybe two. Because you're aggressive. But in the long run, over the course of a season, no chance. 
JAMES Why's that? 
NIKI Because you're not serious. You're just a party guy. Which is why everyone likes you. 
JAMES Now try saying that and tell me you're not jealous. 
(CONTINUED) 83   CONTINUED:                                                     83 
NIKI But all that affection, all those smiles is also a sign of their disrespect! They don't fear you. Whereas compare that to me... 
JAMES Whom no one likes... 
NIKI Right.. 
JAMES Not even his own team-mates.. 
NIKI Right! Because I'm relentless. I don't screw up. I go to bed early. I look after myself, look after my car. And then, soon as the race is finished, I go home. You should go home more often, too. I heard you got married. 
JAMES I did. 
NIKI So where is she? 
JAMES In New York. Working. 
NIKI You know I've never seen you with her, once... 
NIKI turns to MARLENE, "Let's go".. 
84   EXT. EASTON NESTON - DAY                                        84 
JAMES's Mini roars furiously up the long gravel driveway towards Easton Neston. Screeches to a halt. 
JAMES gets out of the car. Is greeted by staff, whom he uncharacteristically ignores, storming past... 
85   INT. EASTON NESTON - WORKSHOP - DAY                             85

JAMES Right, whatever it takes to beat Lauda, just say it, your word is my command. I'll do it. There are no lengths to which I will not go. And I mean it this time... 
JAMES stops, noticing BUBBLES's expression... 
JAMES What's the matter? 
Then JAMES notices what BUBBLES is doing. He's packing. 
JAMES What are you doing? 
Then JAMES notices the lack of activity in the workshops. None of the usual mechanics, or engineers.. 
JAMES Where is everyone? 
JAMES Fuck off to New York, dear. There must be a moisturizer or eye shadow somewhere that needs your vapid mush to flog it. 
SUZY How quickly beauty can turn ugly. 
JAMES Agreed. Repellent. 
SUZY stares...and goes. JAMES carries on drinking.

The following morning. The phone rings. Piercing the darkness. JAMES, clearly the worse for wear, is talking to his beloved budgies... 
JAMES Good girl... 
A surprising vulnerability, and childlike innocence about JAMES. He strokes the birds with real tenderness.. 
The phone continues ringing. JAMES picks it up... 
(CONTINUED) 90   CONTINUED:                                                      90 
JAMES (INTO PHONE) Hello? 
JAMES listens, then hears something on the phone that makes him sit up... 
JAMES (INTO PHONE) Who? McLaren? 
JAMES is waking rapidly now.. 
JAMES (INTO PHONE) Just get me in a room with them, Pete. Say anything. Today? Yes, I can do today. (checks watch) I can be there in an hour. 
JAMES starts scribbling down the address. 
91   EXT. MCLAREN HQ - TO ESTABLISH                                   91 
The headquarters of McLaren Racing in Colnbrook, Bucks. 
A small, unassuming building on the Poyle Trading Estate. Bare brickwork surrounds a brash yellow facade, with the words `MCLAREN RACING' in large white letters. 
92   INT. MCLAREN HQ - BOARDROOM - DAY                                92 
A large boardroom. Team Director TEDDY MAYER (American, from Pennsylvania, short, lawyerly, 50's - hair turning grey) sits at the head of the table. 
Next to him is Aussie Marlboro spokesman JOHN HOGAN and McLaren Team Manager and chief mechanic ALASTAIR CALDWELL. 
The atmosphere is tense, uncomfortable... 
MAYER I'll come straight to the point. Our esteemed lead driver... 
CALDWELL Fitti-fucking-paldi.. 
MAYER Has ditched us for another team at the last minute.. 
CALDWELL In November. Fucking outrageous. 
(CONTINUED) 92   CONTINUED:                                                     92 
MAYER And we need a replacement. Asap. Thankfully a few hands have already gone up. Good people... 
CALDWELL Like Jackie Ickx. 
JAMES I'm quicker than Jackie. 
MAYER But he's consistent, dependable. Sponsor friendly. He'll dress up nice. Say the right things. 
JAMES What do you want? A driver or a brushes salesman? 
MAYER We want to be successful. 
JAMES So do I. But I measure that in podium finishes and beating Niki Lauda not being a show pony for sponsors. 
MAYER I've heard about this thing with Lauda. 
CALDWELL (rolls eyes) Everyone has.. 
MAYER You really think you can beat him? He's World Champion. 
JAMES I beat him in Formula 3. 
CALDWELL This season alone he's had eight podiums, five wins, you've had what? 
HOGAN One. 
JAMES Only because I've been in the wrong car. I beat him when the playing field was level. I'd beat him again in a McLaren. (MORE)

Raised voices debating the width of the car, HUNT furious, people almost coming to blows... 
OFFICIAL The car is too wide.. 
JAMES Five eighths of an inch..! 
OFFICIAL Which makes it illegal! If you want to compete, you have to change it. 
JAMES What? You can't just `change it'. That means rebuilding the car. Who lodged the complaint? It was Ferrari, wasn't it?

CALDWELL But that'll have a knock-on effect on the oil coolers..

MARLENE walks through the house, looking for NIKI. Then finds him on a balcony...alone.. 
MARLENE Come to bed. 
MARLENE notices his mood. It's different. 
MARLENE What's the matter? 
NIKI It's the enemy, you know. Happiness. 
NIKI looks up at MARLENE... 
NIKI It weakens you. Puts doubt in your mind. Because all of a sudden you have something to lose.. 
MARLENE stares at him. 
MARLENE When you call happiness an enemy, then it's too late. (a beat) Then you have lost already. 
MARLENE turns, and goes.. 
NIKI is left alone. We can tell from his expression, he is struggling with something for the first time. Fear.

CALDWELL We've just been told, a driver's meeting has been called. 
JAMES Who by? 
CALDWELL Niki. 
JAMES's face. Instantly suspicious. 
142 INT. MEETING ROOM - NURBURGRING RACE TRACK - DAY               142 
About sixty people, (26 DRIVERS and all the different team REPRESENTATIVES), are assembled in the room, where a blazered FIA OFFICIAL and a member of the DRIVERS SAFETY COMMITTEE are sitting behind a table... 
A buzz of anticipation and curiosity. What's going on? What is all this about? NIKI gets to his feet, raises his hands calling for silence... 
(CONTINUED) 142 CONTINUED:                                                    142 
NIKI Thank you. I called this meeting because as all drivers know the Nurburgring is a race track from the Stone Ages. The most stupid, barbaric, outdated, dangerous, track in the world. You've all seen the rain which has been falling this morning. Those of you with experience know the Ring needs perfect conditions to be even remotely acceptable in terms of risk. As you can see today is anything BUT perfect, so I called this meeting to take a vote to cancel the race. 
Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry? 
ALASTAIR CALDWELL comes up to JAMES, and shouts above the noise - no time to plug his headset in... 
(CONTINUED) 144 CONTINUED:                                                    144 
CALDWELL Jochen's going on slicks. You want to change? 
JAMES looks in his wing-mirror back to his colleague, JOCHEN MASS's car, number 12, several rows behind him. 
White helmet. A team of Mclaren MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to bald, dry tyres - ('slicks'). Then JAMES looks over at the car beside him... 
JAMES Has Niki changed? 
CALDWELL No. He's going on wets. 
NIKI's car: surrounded by Italian Ferrari MECHANICS. 
JAMES Then we go on wets, too. 
JAMES pulls down his visor...as he and NIKI's eyes meet for a split-second, then... 
The STARTER waves the flag. They're off! 
JAMES's foot hits the floor - his engine screams at almost 9,000 rpms, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd. The car is catapaulted forward, the wheel-spin leaving livid black scars on the asphalt.. 
JAMES and NIKI both make good starts, and are neck and neck, but within seconds there's a McLaren right behind them, gaining fast. 
JAMES realizes it's his team-mate, JOCHEN MASS in a white helmet. Number 12. On his slick tyres. 
MASS was right to gamble on the track drying out. JAMES curses under his breath... 
JAMES Shit...! 
JAMES screwed up. Made the wrong decision. He urgently needs to change tyres. With barely one lap completed... 
He swerves angrily into the pits.. 
145 INT. PITS - DAY                                                145 
Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the crazy, panicked situation as JAMES comes into the pits to change to dry tyres. 
The McLaren team frantically changes the tyres. Four men with air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks. 
ALASTAIR CALDWELL appears, talks to JAMES.. 
CALDWELL See? I told you to go on slicks!! You didn't take my advice... 
JAMES Shut up! Where's Niki? 
CALDWELL Behind you! He made the same mistake! 
JAMES looks in his mirror to see NIKI's red helmet behind him in the pits, then... 
"Thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac. JAMES gets the signal, `Clear!' 
CALDWELL Go! Go!! Go!! 
JAMES's foot hits the floor. He roars out, with new tyres, leaving NIKI behind him in the pits... 
146 EXT. NUBURGRING - DAY                                          146

147 INT. JAMES'S CAR - DAY                                         147 
JAMES gives it everything he's got. Tearing through the gears, breaking as late as he can, engine screaming. 
The world flies past in a blur. The steering wheel shakes. The car cannot be driven any harder. No thought for safety. No thought of failure.. 
Failure is unimaginable. Unconscionable. 
He turns into the final straight, then stops when he sees something ahead. 
(CONTINUED) 147 CONTINUED:                                                     147 
Flags. Red flags. RACE MARSHALLS. Something has clearly happened. An accident.. 
The race is being stopped. JAMES brakes, slowing down. He pulls level with a uniformed MARSHALL.. 
JAMES What's up? 
MARSHALL Accident. Bad one. 
JAMES Who? 
MARSHALL We don't know yet. 
But to no avail. The PRIEST continues giving last rites. MARLENE continues to cry. The PRIEST touches NIKI's shoulder... 
NIKI (V/O) I'm here! Can't you tell? I'm here! 
(CONTINUED) 156 CONTINUED:                                                   156 
NIKI screams inside. Wanting to be heard. Wanting to give them a sign. He's OK. He's still there. But it's no use. 
NIKI blacks out again. The pain is too great. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
157 INT. CORRIDOR - HOSPITAL - DAY                                 157 
Sunrise: MARLENE has been sitting in the hospital all night supported by members of FAMILY and several FRIENDS. 
Niki's MOTHER and FATHER. CLAY REGAZZONI. 
Presently: the door to the intensive care unit opens and a DOCTOR comes out, beckoning her... 
DOCTOR Frau Lauda? Bitte kommen Sie! He's awake! And just spoke! 
MARLENE scrambles to her feet... 
MARLENE What did he say? 
DOCTOR "Tell the Priest to fuck off! I'm still alive!!" 
MARLENE covers her mouth, laughs nervously, already in tears. She and the DOCTOR rush into the intensive care unit. 
158 EXT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - DAY                                 158 
Shooting through the window we see MARLENE approach NIKI's bed. She sees NIKI.. 
And gasps. Trying to control her expression. Not give away to him how horrified she is. 
NIKI's face: is grotesque. His head has swollen to double it's size. The skin has burned off on his head, his eyes. 
MARLENE bravely composes herself. Then, without displaying the shock she feels - she goes over and kisses him.

NIKI watches the race on television, while beginning his rehab in bed, in pain as bandages are changed.. 
ON TV: JAMES narrowly misses out on a podium, but still gains on NIKI in his points total... 
CAPTION: "RACE 11. HUNT FINISHES 4th" 
161 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY - (A WEEK LATER)                           161 
NIKI continues his rehab in the hospital, now out of bed... 
ON TV: the starter's flag drops. Another Grand Prix starts. This time at Zandvoort, in the Netherlands.. 
NIKI watches the race on television as DOCTORS put a vacuuum pump into his lungs. It's AGONY. JAMES leads, driving the perfect race... 
YOUNG GERMAN DOCTOR We need to vacuum the lungs. Without this, they can't heal. But it will hurt. 
An unimaginably painful pump is forced down his burned lungs, to try to hoover out the impurities.. 
COMMENTATORS ON TV: talk about how HUNT is catching up with LAUDA on points. It spurs NIKI on, through gritted teeth. 
NIKI Aaarrrggghhhh... 
The chequered flag. JAMES crosses the line in first position. 
CAPTION: "RACE 12. HUNT WINS." 
The DOCTORS tell NIKI he's had enough vacuum treatment. He's had more than enough pain. But NIKI waves them aside... 
NIKI Again!! 
The DOCTOR nods. The vacuum is turned on again. 
NIKI screams in agony. Eyes bulging. MARLENE and NIKI's family cannot bear to watch... 
(CONTINUED) 161 CONTINUED:                                                    161

NIKI continues screaming in pain, watching the Canadian GP on TV as.. 
NIKI sits on the podium, in front of microphones, flanked on both sides by FERRARI drivers and top brass. But no one wants to talk to them. Everyone's here to talk to NIKI.. 
JAPANESE JOURNALIST How are you feeling, Niki? 
NIKI Fine. 
AMERICAN JOURNALIST Can you confirm for us exactly which procedures you have had? And the expectations for your recovery? 
(CONTINUED) 167 CONTINUED:                                                    167 
NIKI Sure. I had a skin graft operation where they put half my right thigh in my face. It doesn't look too good but one unexpected advantage is it's impossible to perspire through a skin graft, so sweat will never run in my eyes again - which is good for a driver. 
Laughter. At the back of the hall, JAMES HUNT creeps in, (unseen by anyone, disguised in a hat), to listen. 
BRAZILIAN JOURNALIST When they heard about your condition, Ferrari immediately hired another driver, Carlos Reutemann. 
NIKI Ja. Before even my first operation. 
JAPANESE JOURNALIST Is he your replacement now? 
NIKI No. Just another team-mate. Keen to make an impression. So let's see where Mr. Reutemann finishes today. 
Laughter. 
JAPANESE JOURNALIST James Hunt and McLaren have caught up a lot while you were away. 
NIKI Yes. (a beat) Is there a question now? Or are you just trying to piss me off? 
Laughter. 
JAPANESE JOURNALIST You think you can still win? 
NIKI Of course. I have the better car. I'm the better driver. But he's a clever guy and has used the time well while I was lying half-dead in hospital to win some points.. 
Laughter. 
(CONTINUED) 167 CONTINUED: (2)                                               167 
BRITISH JOURNALIST What did your wife say when she saw your face? 
NIKI She said, "Sweetie, you don't need a face to drive. Only a right foot." 
Laughter. 
BRITISH JOURNALIST I'm being serious. Do you really think your marriage can survive? With the way you look now? 
Silence. NIKI squints into the lights.. 
NIKI And I'm being serious, too. Which asshole said this? Jesus.. 
No one moves. NIKI, disgusted, rips off his microphone.. 
NIKI Fuck you. Press conference over. 
NIKI walks out. The Press Conference breaks up... 
JAMES sees the REPORTER who asked the question, laughing with his friends. JAMES watches as the REPORTER leaves... 
168 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PRESS CONFERENCE - SAME TIME             168 
JAMES goes after the REPORTER, and calls him.. 
JAMES Hey..! 
The REPORTER turns, recognizes JAMES.. 
JAMES I've got something for you on that last question... 
The BRITISH JOURNALIST smiles, "Great, thanks James!" Pulls out a tape recorder. JAMES takes him to one side, then... 
"WHACK, WHACK, WHACK" - JAMES punches his lights out, then takes the tape recorder, stuffs it into the JOURNALISTS mouth. 
JAMES Now go home to your wife and ask her how YOU look!! 
(CONTINUED) 168 CONTINUED:                                                    168

Everyone talking about NIKI's comeback. 
NIKI is in his car. The MECHANICS are talking to him in Italian... 
Mount Fuji towers imperiously, dramatically above the Japanese race track, dominating the skyline on a clear day.. 
Television cameras and press photographers assemble at the race track for the biggest sporting event of the year...

JAMES (ON PHONE) The man was in a coma. His doctors pronounced him dead!! Then he comes back and does THAT??? 
174AINT. BUBBLES HORSELY HOME - MORNING                         174A 
BUBBLES HORSLEY back at home in England. At a breakfast table.. 
BUBBLES (ON PHONE) What did you expect? That Niki would give you the championship lying down? Of course not. He's a fighter. He's going to come at you with everything he's got. But you can do this. As a driver, you're his equal - better, maybe. And God knows you're quick and brave enough. You just.. 
JAMES (ON PHONE) What? 
BUBBLES (ON PHONE) Need to find the respect for yourself to close out when it really matters. You don't much like yourself, James - that's the problem, therefore don't believe you deserve it. 
174BINT. JAMES'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                             174B 
A knock at JAMES's hotel room door.. 
JAMES I've got to go. 
JAMES hangs up, and goes to the door. He snaps it open to reveal.. 
Two gorgeous-looking BOAC Stewardesses standing outside. Smart blue blazers, short skirts, white gloves, blue caps.. 
STEWARDESS Hi. We've come for the party? 
JAMES What party? 
STEWARDESS The party we were told was going on in room 2109. 
Sure enough: on JAMES's door, the number 2109. 
JAMES Who sent you here? 
(CONTINUED) 174BCONTINUED:                                                   174B 
STEWARDESS A man. On the phone. He didn't give his name. 
JAMES This man. Did he speak with an accent? 
STEWARDESS Yes. German accent. 
JAMES can't believe it. NIKI. 
JAMES I'm afraid it was a joke.. 
STEWARDESS (liking the look of JAMES) Awwww. Pity. 
JAMES Sorry, ladies. Any other time. Not tonight. 
JAMES closes the door. Goes back into his hotel room. Then, after a moment... 
He snaps open the door. The STEWARDESSES are about to disappear into the elevator... 
JAMES Wait..!

The two STEWARDESSES are still asleep in the bed beside him. Uniforms discarded on the floor. 
Memories are now flooding back. Jesus, what was he THINKING? JAMES leaps out of bed. 
178 INT. NIKI'S ROOM - HOTEL - DAY                                 178 
JAMES No! No! NO!!!! 
JAMES tries to fend NIKI off. Swerves this way and that. But his wounded car is now running at seventy per cent at best... 
...and disaster!!! NIKI OVERTAKES HIM... 
JAMES screams in agony and frustration. He's lost it! And has no one to blame but himself! His own arrogance. And stubbornness. NIKI's overtaken him! 
THE CHEQUERED FLAG. 
JAMES roars past. Has finished in third place. But that is no consolation. NIKI has beaten him. As far as he's concerned.. 
JAMES has lost. Lost everything.

MAYER You WON!! 
JAMES Rubbish!! What about Niki?? He overtook me!! I saw it!! A Ferrari with a red helmet.. 
MAYER That wasn't Niki. That was Regazzoni. 
JAMES What??? 
MAYER Niki withdrew. Said it was too dangerous, refused to drive!! (gestures) You're Champion of the World, kiddo! 
TEDDY MAYER takes JAMES's number `11' from the side of his car, and tears it in two, leaving number `1'. 
JAMES's face: as he realizes. Then explodes with happiness.

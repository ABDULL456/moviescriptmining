"SIDEWAYS" 
Screenplay by 
Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor 
Based on the novel by 
Rex Pickett 
May 29, 2003 
UNDER THE STUDIO LOGO: 
KNOCKING at a door and distant dog BARKING. 
NOW UNDER BLACK, a CARD -- 
SATURDAY 
The rapping, at first tentative and polite, grows insistent. Then we hear someone get out of bed. 
MILES (O.S.) ...the fuck... 
A DOOR is opened, and the black gives way to BLINDING WHITE LIGHT, the way one experiences the first glimpse of day amid, say, a hangover. 
A WORKER is there. 
MILES (O.S.) Yeah? 
WORKER Hi, Miles. Can you move your car, please? 
MILES (O.S.) Why? 
WORKER The painters got to put the truck in, and you didn't park too good. 
MILES (O.S.) (a sigh, then --) Yeah, hold on. 
He closes the door with a SLAM. 
EXT. MILES'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY 
SUPERIMPOSE -- 
SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA 
Wearing only underwear, a bathrobe and clogs, MILES RAYMOND comes out of his unit and heads toward the street. He passes some SIX MEXICANS waiting to work. 
He climbs into his twelve-year-old CONVERTIBLE SAAB, parked far from the curb and blocking part of the driveway. The car starts fitfully. 
As he pulls away, the guys begin backing up the truck. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Miles rounds the corner and finds a new parking spot. 
INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS 
He cuts the engine, exhales a long breath and brings his hands to his head in a gesture of headache pain or just anguish. He leans back in his seat, closes his eyes, and soon NODS OFF. 
INT. MILES'S APARTMENT - DAY 
The door bursts open. Miles runs into the kitchen, looking just past camera. 
MILES Fuck! 
WHIP PAN TO -- 
THE MICROWAVE CLOCK that reads 10:50. 
ON THE PHONE -- 
Miles hurriedly throws clothes into a suitcase. 
MILES Yeah, no, I know I said I'd be there by noon, but there's been all this work going on at my building, and it's like a total nightmare, and I had a bunch of stuff to deal with this morning. But I'm on my way. I'm out the door right this second. It's going to be great. Yeah. Bye. 
INT. MILES'S BATHROOM - DAY 
ON THE TOILET -- 
Miles has a BOOK propped open on his knees. He turns a page, lost in his reading. 
LATER -- 
Miles SHOWERS. 
IN THE MIRROR -- 
Miles FLOSSES. 
INT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY 
Miles finally makes it to the front of the line. 
BARISTA Hey, Miles. 
MILES Hey, Simon. Triple espresso, please. 
BARISTA Rough night, huh? (ringing it up) For here? 
MILES No, I'm running late. Make it to go. And give me a New York Times and... (scanning the display case) ...a spinach croissant. 
INSIDE THE CAR -- 
Miles accelerates as he and Jack wave back. 
JACK Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now. 
MILES I can't help the traffic. 
JACK Come on. You're fucking hungover. 
MILES Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box. 
Jack turns around, and starts rooting around in a CARDBOARD WINE BOX. 
MILES Why did you tell them my book was being published? 
JACK You said you had it all lined up. 
MILES No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum... 
JACK Yeah, Conundrum. 
MILES ...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already. 
JACK I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me. 
MILES It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring. 
Jack sits back in his seat holding up a bottle of CHAMPAGNE and TWO GLASSES. 
JACK But I know it's going to happen this time. I can feel it. This is the one. I'm proud of you, man. You're the smartest guy I know. 
Jack now begins to remove the foil from the champagne bottle. 
MILES Don't open that now. It's warm. 
JACK Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it. 
MILES That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it! 
Jack untwists the wire. Instantly the cork pops off, and a fountain of champagne erupts. 
MILES For Christ's Sake, Jack! You just wasted like half of it! 
Jack begins pouring two glasses. 
JACK Shut up. (handing Miles a glass) Here's to a great week. 
MILES (coming around) Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together. 
JACK Yeah. 
MILES You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen. 
They clink and drink. 
JACK Oh, that's tasty. 
MILES 100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore. 
JACK Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark? 
MILES Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron. 
JACK Just tell me. 
MILES Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color. 
JACK (not really listening) Sure is tasty. 
EXT. FREEWAY - DAY 
The Saab heads north. 
INT. SAAB - DAY 
The boys continue to drink and drive. 
MILES Did you read the latest draft, by the way? 
JACK Oh, yeah. Yeah. 
MILES And? 
JACK I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something. 
MILES How about the new ending? Did you like that? 
JACK Oh yeah. Much better. 
MILES There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same. 
JACK Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different. 
INT. GAS STATION #1 - DAY 
Miles is pumping gas. Jack is stretching his legs nearby or perhaps cleaning the windshield. 
A CELLPHONE RINGS. Jack reaches into his pocket. 
JACK (looking at the phone) It's Christine. (snapping it open) Hey you. 
CHRIS We like it. 
JACK (to Miles) You know, you could work in a wine store. 
MILES Yeah, that would be a good move. 
Now Miles notices something about Jack. 
MILES Are you chewing gum? 
JACK Want some? 
EXT. SOLVANG, CALIFORNIA - DAY 
The Saab passes through this Danish-themed tourist town. 
SUPERIMPOSE -- 
SOLVANG 
EXT. BUELLTON, CALIFORNIA - DAY 
The Saab makes its way into this very average-looking Central coast town right off the freeway. 
SUPERIMPOSE -- 
BUELLTON 
EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY 
The Saab pulls into the parking lot of this motel. And look -- there's the WINDMILL itself, its decorative blades motionless. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Miles and Jack enter the room and throw their suitcases onto their respective beds. 
LATER -- 
The sounds of a SHOWER and OFF-KEY SINGING come from the bathroom while Miles sits impatiently on the bed. He pounds on the wall. 
MILES Hey Jack, hurry up! 
JACK (O.S.) Just a minute! 
Opening the bedside drawer, Miles finds a GIDEON'S BIBLE and tosses it in the trash -- apparently his hotel routine. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 246 - DUSK 
Freshly showered and dressed for dinner, Miles and Jack amble along the shoulder of this busy local two-lane highway. They pass a mall and a car dealership. 
JACK I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out. 
MILES It's not even a mile. 
JACK We should have driven. 
MILES Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back. 
JACK You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine? 
MILES Whoa. 
JACK Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it. 
MILES Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life. 
JACK Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff. 
MILES So you're going to stop acting? 
JACK No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along. 
MILES Uh-huh. 
JACK We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down. 
MILES If that's what feels right. 
JACK (convincing himself) It does. Feels right. 
MILES Then it's a good thing. 
JACK (nodding, feeling better) Yeah. It's good. Feels good. 
Miles leads them away from the road and across a parking lot. The camera PANS to reveal -- 
THE HITCHING POST, a local institution. 
INT. HITCHING POST BAR - DUSK 
Miles and Jack belly up. GARY, the Samoan bartender, spots Miles and extends a welcoming hand. 
GARY Hey, Miles. Long time no see. 
MILES Gary. 
GARY When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it. 
MILES Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week. 
GARY (shaking Jack's hand) My condolences. 
Jack and Miles are enjoying a post-prandial drink. 
MILES 
Looks like he's thinking about something. Then -- 
MILES I hate Tony Levin. 
Jack swirls his wine and downs it in one gulp. Just then -- 
MAYA 
Walks into the bar and takes a seat a few stools down. She has changed into a black cashmere sweater and corduroys, lovely but tired. 
MAYA (to Gary) Highliner, please. 
JACK That's on us. 
Maya looks over and smiles as Gary pours her a glass from their bottle. 
MAYA Hey, guys. 
Maya gets an American Spirit Yellow out of her purse and lights it while Gary pours her a glass. 
MILES You want to join us? 
MAYA (polite) Sure. 
In no hurry, she takes a long sip of her wine, gets up and comes down the bar. 
MAYA So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked. 
MILES I finished it. 
MAYA Good for you. 
JACK It's getting published. That's what we're up here celebrating. 
Miles shoots Jack a look. Jack responds with a "don't-fuck- it-up-brother" glower. 
MAYA That's fantastic. Congratulations. 
She offers her glass, and all clink. 
MAYA (to Jack) Are you a writer too? 
JACK No, I'm an actor. 
MAYA Oh yeah? What kind of stuff? 
JACK A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly. 
MAYA Anything I'd know? 
JACK Maybe. Recognize this? 
Jack takes a deep breath, and out comes a perfect VOICE-OVER VOICE. 
JACK "Now with low, low 5.8% APR financing." 
Maya's mouth drops open and curves into a big smile. 
MAYA That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys. 
JACK I am one of those guys. 
MAYA You are not. 
MILES He is. 
Jack launches into another one of his sure-fire hits. 
JACK (very fast) Consult your doctor before using this product. Side effects may include oily discharge, dizziness, hives, loss of appetite, difficulty breathing and low blood pressure. If you have diabetes or a history of kidney trouble... you're fucked! 
This makes Maya laugh a big throaty laugh. Jack joins in. Nervous about Jack's aggressive flirtatiousness, Miles musters a tight courtesy smile. 
MAYA (winding down) Oh. I needed that. Thank you. 
They all take a drink of wine. 
MAYA So what are you guys up to tonight? 
Before Jack has a chance to speak -- 
MILES We're pretty wiped. Probably go back to the hotel and crash. 
This makes Maya slightly embarrassed at her apparent availability, but she recovers quickly, remains breezy. 
MAYA Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying? 
MILES The Windmill. 
JACK Windmill. 
Maya downs the rest of her wine, stamps out her smoke, and picks up her jean jacket and purse. 
MAYA Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack. 
MILES See you. 
As she leaves -- 
WAITRESS Okay. And you? 
JACK (glaring at Miles) Pigs in a blanket. With extra syrup. 
EXT. LOVELY HIGHWAY - DAY 
The Saab winds along this beautiful road that meanders through large open vineyards. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INSERT -- 
A MAP and a MOVING LINE show the boys' route. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INSERT -- 
GRAPES growing on the vine. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. VINEYARD - DAY 
Framed by foreground grapevines, the Saab passes in the distance. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. FOXEN WINERY - DAY 
Miles has just downed a taste of red wine. 
MILES How much skin and stem contact? 
POURER About four weeks. 
MILES Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak? 
POURER About a year. 
MILES French or American? 
POURER Both. 
MILES Good stuff. 
JACK Yeah, oak. That's a good wood. 
Just as the pourer turns away toward other TASTERS, Jack GRABS the bottle and helps himself and Miles to another glass. They slam back their drinks like tequila. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. LOVELY AREA ON A HILL - DAY 
Miles brings the Saab to a stop, and the guys get out. Before them lies an incredible view of endless vineyards. 
MILES Nice, huh? 
JACK Beautiful. 
MILES Victoria and I used to like this view. (lost in nostalgia) Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care. 
JACK Miles. 
MILES She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines. 
JACK Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding. 
MILES I know. You told me. I'm okay with it. 
JACK Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried. 
MILES She what? (long pause) When? 
JACK About a month ago. Six weeks. 
MILES To that guy? That guy with the restaurant... 
Jack nods. Miles looks down at his shoes and draws a long breath. Then he stiffly gets back in the open car and closes the door. 
JACK Miles... MILES... 
Miles continues to stare straight ahead. 
JACK (exploding) Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out! 
MILES I want to go home now. 
JACK You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something. 
MILES Is she bringing him to the wedding? 
JACK What do you think? 
MILES You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before? 
JACK Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party! 
MILES (undeterred) I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin? 
JACK No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool. 
STEPHANIE This is our Estate Syrah... 
She pours each of them a full HALF GLASS. 
JACK You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie. 
STEPHANIE I know. I might need to be spanked. 
She notices the boring couple, visibly annoyed that she has been monopolized. 
STEPHANIE Excuse me. 
As she wanders down the bar, Jack turns to Miles, his mouth wide open. 
JACK A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked. 
MILES Do you know how often these pourers get hit on? 
They glance down the bar at Stepanie. She smiles back. 
EXT. KALYRA WINERY PARKING LOT - DAY 
Miles is killing time by the car staring at his shoes. He looks over and sees Jack waddling over from the tasting room with TWO CASES OF WINE. 
JACK Get the trunk. 
MILES You have the keys. 
Jack puts the cases down and glances back at the building. 
JACK We're on. 
MILES What? 
JACK She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out. 
MILES With Maya? 
JACK Been divorced for a year now, bud. 
Jack puts the wine in the trunk, and they get in the car. 
JACK Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on. 
MILES Well, she is cute. 
JACK Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you? (drumming on the steering wheel) Gotta love it. Gotta love it. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY 
THE TV -- 
GOLF on ESPN. 
MILES AND JACK 
sit transfixed, each on his own bed. The curtains are drawn. Then out of nowhere -- 
JACK (mocking) You know how often these pourers get hit on? (getting up) I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come? 
MILES Nah. I want to watch this. 
CLOSE ON THE TV -- 
A guy gets ready to putt. The announcer whispers what an important moment this is. The guy misses. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
UNDER BLACK -- 
The sound of an AEROSOL CAN. 
JACK Miles. Hey, Miles. Time to get up. 
WE OPEN OUR EYES TO SEE -- 
Jack spraying his feet with some Dr. Scholl's product. 
WIDE -- 
Miles pulls himself out of bed and slouches toward his suitcase. 
JACK Fucking chick in the Jacuzzi -- goddamn, Miles, fucking going nuts up here. Whole place is wide open. Assylvania. 
Jack does some actor's weird warm-up stretch. 
MILES So what should I wear? 
JACK I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer. 
As Miles begins to dig through his suitcase, Jack flips open his cellphone and speed-dials. 
JACK Don't you have any other shoes? 
Miles glances as his shoes sitting sadly on the floor. 
JACK (into the phone) Hello? Oh hey, baby, just checking in. Not much. We're about to go out for dinner, probably be out pretty late, so I thought I'd say goodnight now. I know, I love you too. I miss you. 
EXT. LOS OLIVOS - NIGHT 
The boys get out of the car and walk along a timbered sidewalk in this tourist town with wine tasting rooms and gourmet restaurants. 
Miles draws a long breath. 
STEPHANIE What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine. 
MILES Exactement! 
Jack shoots Miles a look. 
MAYA I'm having the salmon. 
MILES That's what I'm having. 
STEPHANIE (still scanning the wines) I'm thinking about the duck breast. 
JACK (slapping his menu shut) Me too. 
MAYA Well, that narrows things down. 
Stephanie lowers the menu so that only her eyes peer over the top. She looks at the others, and they look back at her. 
STEPHANIE Sounds like... Pinot Noir to me. 
Jack looks at Miles and raises one hand for a HIGH-FIVE. 
JACK Pinot! 
Miles reluctantly slaps Jack's hand. This causes the girls to laugh. MUSIC STARTS -- they're OFF! 
DINNER is improvised, but includes: 
-- The arrival of the FIRST WINE. 
-- The SALADS. 
-- Maya takes a turn with the wine list. Miles pushes her finger down into the prices with THREE DIGITS. 
-- New stemware is provided with the arrival of the SECOND WINE. 
-- The four of them DRINK. Particularly Miles. 
-- Stephanie and Jack get cozier and cozier. 
-- The SALMON and DUCK arrive. 
-- Miles is too shy to look into Maya's eyes. She's interested and available -- it's too much for him. 
-- As Miles gets DRUNKER, the camera angles become sloppier, the cutting choppier. 
-- Miles PONTIFICATES about some aspect of wine that Maya and Stephanie find interesting. Left out in the cold, his jaw tight, Jack wants to find a way in but can't. 
-- Miles reaches over to refill his glass, but Jack's arm shoots out to stop him -- "Slow down." 
CLOSE ON MILES as a distant RUMBLE begins to sound, the rumble of an oncoming ANXIETY ATTACK. By now he has drunk so much that he spaces out, descending into -- 
INT. UNDERWORLD - DARK AND TIMELESS 
Miles is boarding an OPEN BOAT atop this underground river, the River Styx. Just beyond a ghoulish HUMAN CARGO the hooded boatman CHARON wields a long staff. Miles is crossing over to the dark side. 
INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - BACK AGAIN 
Miles returns to earth to find Jack and Stephanie now in their own little world -- Jack explaining something to Stephanie that she finds fascinating, just FASCINATING. 
-- Miles converses with Maya, but it's clear from her bemused expression that he's being charming if not entirely coherent. 
-- ANOTHER WINE reaches the table -- a Comte Armand Pornrnard. 
-- Miles looks over at Jack and Stephanie. They share a short but sensual kiss. 
MOMENTS LATER -- 
Miles is on his feet threading his way through the tables. He is very unsteady, and we cut between first and third person perspectives. 
AT THE BATHROOMS -- 
He tries the MEN'S ROOM door but it's locked. He pulls the XANAX out his pocket and pops one in his mouth, swallowing it dry. 
He notices a PAYPHONE nearby. Thinking better of it for a moment, Miles makes a drunken bee-line for the receiver. 
CLOSE ON THE KEYPAD -- 
as many numbers are dialed, and we HEAR the TONES, completely out of sync, along with a sound melange of interior phone RINGING and a PICKUP. 
THE RECEIVER -- 
As Miles presses it desperately to his head. 
VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE) Hello? 
MILES Victoria. 
VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE) Miles? 
Miles feigns an implausible upbeat tone. 
MILES Victoria! How the hell are you? 
VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE) Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind? 
MILES Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round. 
VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE) Oh, Miles. You're drunk. 
Miles looks at the water, takes it and drains it. 
The girls now return to the table. The guys slide over. 
MILES (trying to appear sober) Should we get dessert? 
STEPHANIE We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever. 
Jack raises both arms like a football referee. 
JACK Excellent idea. Waiter! 
INT. SAAB - NIGHT 
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- 
Trees and bushes lit by the headlights show us we're headed into the woods. 
INSIDE -- 
Jack drives. Miles blinks heavily as he tries to make a sense of A HAND-DRAWN MAP. 
JACK (grabbing the map) Let me see that. 
EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The Saab pulls into a gravel DRIVEWAY and comes to a stop outside this wood-framed cottage. 
Jack and Miles get out and head for the front door. On the way, Jack reaches into his coat pocket and produces a string of FOUR CONDOMS. 
JACK (tearing) Here. One for you, three for me. 
Miles wordlessly takes his. Just before they climb the porch steps -- 
MILES You sure you want to do this? 
Jack stops and looks at him for a moment with almost hostile incredulity. 
THE FRONT DOOR is open. Jack knocks twice on the SCREEN DOOR before going in. 
INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The boys enter this modest living room furnished with weathered but charming old furniture. Scattered here and there are CHILDREN'S TOYS. FINGER-PAINTINGS are taped to the walls. CANDLES are lit, and MUSIC is playing. 
JACK We're here! 
Stephanie sails in. 
STEPHANIE What happened to you guys? 
JACK Couple of wrong turns. (pointing a thumb at Miles) Thanks to Magellan, here. 
After a brief hug, Stephanie and Jack peck-kiss. 
JACK Hi. 
STEPHANIE Hi. (to Miles) Maya's in the kitchen. 
Miles hesitates a moment before Jack elbows him toward -- 
EXT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Miles wanders in to find Maya squatting in front of a little temperature-controlled WINE STORAGE UNIT. 
MILES Hi. 
MAYA Hey. 
MILES She got anything good? 
MAYA Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs. (calling out) Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want? 
STEPHANIE (V.O.) Anything but the Jayer Richebourg! 
MILES She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie. 
MAYA Who do you think you're dealing with here? 
Maya slips out a bottle of ESCHEVAUX. 
MAYA How about this? 
Miles nods vigorously. Maya looks back and forth between Miles and the wine, her eyes narrowed. Then she slides it back in. 
MAYA Nope. I don't think we know each other well enough. (picking out another bottle) I'd say this guy's more our speed. 
They rise, and Miles glances at the ANDREW MURRAY SYRAH and, raising his eyebrows, agrees. Maya begins opening it. 
MAYA So what gems do you have in your collection? 
MILES Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc. 
MAYA You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it. (pushing him, playfully stern) Right now. Hurry up... 
Miles laughs, fights back a bit. 
MAYA Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read. 
MILES Yeah, I know. 
MAYA It might be too late already. What are you waiting for? 
MILES I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos... 
MAYA Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos. (sipping the wine) Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think? 
MILES My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good. 
MAYA Can I ask you a personal question? 
MILES (bracing himself) Sure. 
MAYA Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you. 
Miles laughs at first, then smiles wistfully at the question. He searches for the answer in his glass and begins slowly. 
MILES I don't know. It's a hard grape to grow. As you know. It's thin-skinned, temperamental, ripens early. It's not a survivor like Cabernet that can grow anywhere and thrive even when neglected. Pinot needs constant care and attention and in fact can only grow in specific little tucked- away corners of the world. And only the most patient and nurturing growers can do it really, can tap into Pinot's most fragile, delicate qualities. Only when someone has taken the time to truly understand its potential can Pinot be coaxed into its fullest expression. And when that happens, its flavors are the most haunting and brilliant and subtle and thrilling and ancient on the planet. 
Maya has found this answer revealing and moving. 
MILES I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you? 
MAYA What about me? 
MILES I don't know. Why are you into wine? 
MAYA I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about. 
MILES Yeah? Like what? 
MAYA Like what a fraud he was. 
Miles laughs. 
MAYA No, but I do like to think about the life of wine, how it's a living thing. I like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing, how the sun was shining that summer or if it rained... what the weather was like. I think about all those people who tended and picked the grapes, and if it's an old wine, how many of them must be dead by now. I love how wine continues to evolve, how every time I open a bottle it's going to taste different than if I had opened it on any other day. Because a bottle of wine is actually alive -- it's constantly evolving and gaining complexity. That is, until it peaks -- like your '61 -- and begins its steady, inevitable decline. And it tastes so fucking good. 
Now it is Miles's turn to be swept away. Maya's face tells us the moment is right, but Miles remains frozen. He needs another sign, and Maya is bold enough to offer it: reaches out and places one hand atop his. 
MILES (pointing) Bathroom over there? 
MAYA Yeah. 
Miles gets up and walks out. Maya sighs and gets and American Spirit out of her purse. 
INT. STEPHANIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
The bathroom's a MESS -- the shower curtain is filthy, and the chipped and water-stained tub is filled with CHILDREN'S BATH TOYS. 
Miles is bent over the sink splashing water on his face, trying to sober up and gather his courage. He stands, and without drying his face, presses his palms against his cheeks. Then he takes a deep breath and drops his hands. 
MILES You are such a loser. Come on! 
INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Miles comes out of the bathroom and looks for Maya, but she's not there. 
Then he hears a noise from the kitchen, so he goes through the door into -- 
INT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Maya is at the sink, filling a glass with water. 
MAYA I was just getting some water. You want some water? 
Miles goes to stand by her and accepts a glass of water. Just as she's about to fill a second glass, he stops her and looks her in the eye, trying to recapture a moment that is long gone. 
He kisses her and she kisses back, but the whole thing feels strained and awkward. 
After a few seconds, Maya breaks away. 
MAYA Nice. 
But instead of resuming the kiss, she steps past him, heading back into the living room. 
MAYA (O.S.) I should probably get going. 
Miles realizes he's blown it and silently berates himself. 
INT. SAAB - NIGHT 
Miles drives down the hill behind Maya's car, which leads him through this very rural road. 
EXT. WHERE THE ROAD MEETS THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
Maya's car comes to a stop just ahead of the Saab. She puts it in PARK and gets out. 
AT THE SAAB -- 
Miles rolls down his window as Maya leans over. 
MAYA You know how to get back to the Windmill, right? 
MILES Got it. 
MAYA I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did. 
MILES Good. So did I. 
MAYA Okay. See you around. 
MILES Um... did you still want to read my novel? 
MAYA Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course. 
Now Jack closes his eyes and brings the heel of his hand to his forehead as he begins to concoct the BIG LIE. 
JACK (opening his phone) Wait outside, will you? 
EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY 
Miles wanders out and looks down at Stephanie. 
STEPHANIE That was fun last night. 
MILES Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive. 
STEPHANIE Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her. 
Miles says nothing. 
STEPHANIE Where's Jack? 
MILES He had to make a phone call. 
Stephanie cuts her bike's engine and climbs off, propping it up on the kickstand. 
STEPHANIE So what are you up to today, Miles? 
MILES Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing. 
STEPHANIE Huh. 
MILES Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago. 
STEPHANIE Oops. Sorry. 
MILES You golf? 
STEPHANIE Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once. 
MILES Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it. 
Just then Jack cracks open the motel room door. 
JACK (hushed) Hey Miles. Miles. 
Miles ducks back inside. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
JACK Do you have that other condom? 
Miles reaches into his wallet and hands over the little foil square. 
MILES What'd Christine say? 
JACK Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool. 
EXT. WINDMILL INN - CONTINUOUS 
Jack bounds out of the room and down the stairs like a child on Christmas morning. 
Miles watches Jack climb on the bike behind Stephanie, grasping her waist. 
Stephanie and Jack PEEL OUT, leaving Miles alone on the balcony. 
CLOSE ON MILES -- 
As we begin to hear a SNIPPING sound which carries us to -- 
EXT. MOTEL ROOM BALCONY - DAY 
Miles sits outside carefully trimming his toenails. SNIP, SNIP, SNIP. MUSIC BEGINS for this mournful montage of solitude. 
INT. MOTEL LOBBY - DAY 
Miles takes a styrofoam cup and helps himself to a cup of complimentary COFFEE from a PUMP THERMOS. 
Then he takes a look at the rack of pamphlets of local TOURIST ATTRACTIONS -- a water park, a mystery cave, and of course winery after winery. 
EXT. WINDMILL INN JACUZZI - DAY 
Amid turbulent water, Miles corrects his students' papers. He is alone in the tub, but at the nearby pool STOCKY KIDS play noisily with SUPER-SOAKERS. 
OVER MILES'S SHOULDER -- 
The PAPER he's reading is marked up with circled spelling errors, and one entire paragraph has been crossed out. Finding a new error, Miles writes "NO!!!" 
CAMERA PANS to reveal a STACK of papers already heavily marked with corrections, some of them mottled with water stains. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Miles FLOSSES, his lips pulled back into a grotesque moue. Then he brushes with a SONIC-CARE TOOTHBRUSH. 
LATER -- 
Miles checks his machine. 
SYNTHESIZED VOICE (O.S.) No new messages. 
He hangs up, disgusted. 
EXT. CHINA PANDA RESTAURANT - DAY 
A small Buellton eatery. 
MILES Oh, you've been thinking. And? 
JACK I may have to put the wedding on hold is all. 
Miles looks at him with incredulity. 
JACK I fully realize that making a change like that might be tricky for certain people to accept at first, but life is short, Miles. I've got to be sure I'm doing the right thing before taking such a big step. And not just for my sake. I'm thinking about Christine's feelings too. I take marriage very seriously -- always have. That's why I've never done it before. The day I get married, it's going to be the real thing. 
Miles just looks at his friend, waiting for more. 
JACK Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep. 
MILES Deep. 
Miles draws a long sigh. 
JACK Don't get all judgmental on me. This is my deal. It's my life, and it's my call. 
They fall silent for a moment. Then -- 
JACK I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it. 
MILES Understanding of what? 
JACK Like I might be in love with another woman. 
MILES In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything? 
JACK Look who's talking. You've been there. 
MILES Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now? 
JACK This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married? 
MILES And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh? 
JACK (interrupting) Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even. 
MILES You're crazy. You've gone crazy. 
JACK What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine. 
MILES What? Of course I like Christine. 
JACK You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche. 
MILES That was three years ago after that first party! 
JACK Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct. (his hand on his chest) My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong. 
Just then Stephanie walks in. She cozies up to Jack, and he kisses the top of her head. 
STEPHANIE Hi, guys. We should probably get going. 
MILES Where? 
INT. BOWLING ALLEY - DUSK 
CLOSE ON A VIDEO GAME MONITOR 
as a crazy car races through the obstacle-ridden track, often leaving the road, much like Jack's libido. 
ZOOM OUT 
to reveal six-year-old SIENA seated in Jack's lap as they drive together. A delighted Siena laughs and giggles. 
Miles sits nearby with Stephanie and her fifty-something, two-pack-a-day MOTHER CARYL. 
CARYL Stephanie's heard this a thousand times, but if I'd done what I wanted and I'd bought up in Santa Maria when I had the chance, I would have made a fortune when they put in that outlet center and that Home Depot. (a drag off her cigarette, then to Stephanie) Your father knew it too, but he was a fucking chickenshit. Always was. 
Caryl looks over her shoulder, her gaze drawn to Jack and Siena, so completely happy together. 
Caryl exhales a puff of smoke as she watches. Stephanie is equally enthralled. Miles takes it all in, trying his best not to shake his head in disgust. 
INT. BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT - DUSK 
Caryl is behind the wheel of her OLDSMOBILE as Stephanie gets Siena buckled up in the backseat. Jack pulls Miles aside. 
JACK Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay? 
MILES (dispirited) Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie. 
Stephanie kisses Miles's cheek before getting in the car next to her mom. 
STEPHANIE See you, Miles. You take care. 
MILES Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl. 
SIENA AND CARYL Bye, Miles. 
As he gets in the car -- 
JACK Call me on my cell if you go out. 
MILES Yeah. 
Miles watches them drive away, then heads toward his Saab. 
INT. MINI-MART - DUSK 
CLOSE ON THE COUNTER -- 
MILES Nope. 
JACK She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you. 
MILES (preparing to swing) Can you give me some room here? 
JACK (stepping back) Oh yeah. Sure. 
Miles lifts his club. 
JACK You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot. 
MILES Thanks, Jack. 
Miles refocuses and SWINGS just as Jack offers more helpful advice. 
JACK Don't whiff it. 
WHACK! Despite the distraction, Miles manages to make a good, long drive. 
JACK Nice shot. 
MILES You're an asshole. 
NOW ON THE FAIRWAY -- 
Jack is pouring two Dixie cups of wine as Miles prepares to take his next swing. 
JACK What about your agent? Hear anything yet? 
MILES Nope. 
JACK What do you think's going on? 
MILES Could be anything. 
JACK Been checking your messages? 
MILES Obsessively. 
JACK Huh. 
MILES They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life. 
JACK But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say? 
Miles says nothing. 
JACK Or fuck those New York publishers. Publish it yourself. I'll chip in. Just get it out there, get it reviewed, get it in libraries. Let the public decide. 
Giving Jack a look that says Jack has no idea what he's talking about, Miles takes a stance over the ball and focuses. 
JACK Don't come over the top. Stay still. 
MILES Shut up. 
JACK Just trying to be helpful. (a moment later) It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet. 
Miles drops his club and turns to Jack. 
MILES Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP! 
JACK Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile. (holding out a cup of wine) Here. 
Still fuming, Miles begrudgingly accepts the wine and has a taste. He's immediately distracted from his woes. 
MILES What is it? 
JACK I don't know. Got it from Stephanie. 
Miles downs the rest and is intrigued by the taste. 
MILES Huh. Let me see the label. 
Suddenly a golfball THUDS against the hard fairway directly behind them. 
JACK (whirling around) What the fuck? 
Way back on the tee box, some 200 yards away, are a FOURSOME of two couples. One of the MEN is waving his driver. 
HUSBAND #1 (shouting, barely audible) Hurry it up, will you? 
Jack looks at Miles, the two incredulous. 
MILES Fucker hit into us. 
JACK (yelling) Hey, asshole! That's not cool! 
MILES Throw me his ball. 
Jack walks over, picks up the offending ball and tosses it to Miles. Miles gets out his 3-wood and -- THWOCK! -- cuts it back low and hard. 
JACK Nice shot. 
THE COUPLES 
duck for cover as the ball whistles over their heads. 
JACK AND MILES 
laugh hard. 
EXT. IDYLLIC PICNIC SPOT - DAY INTO DUSK 
The girls have led them to a beautiful spot. 
IN A SERIES OF SHOTS -- 
we see the progress of their picnic. We don't hear them, but there is a growing intimacy about their interaction. Even Maya and Miles seem to be overcoming residual awkwardness from the other night. Jack and Stephanie lean on each other as they eat and sip wine. 
Finally, the two couples are SILHOUETTED against the SUNSET. 
EXT. WINERY #3 PARKING LOT - EVENING 
The parking lot is crowded. The foursome join others headed toward the main building. 
INT. WINERY #3 - EVENING 
A LECTURE by British wine sage LESLIE BROUGH is in progress. He holds aloft a RIEDEL BURGUNDY GLASS containing one of the few but growing number of local reds worthy of his attention. 
IN THE AUDIENCE -- 
As our foursome listen attentively, Jack leans over to Miles. 
JACK You ever actually read any of this guy's books? 
MILES He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted. 
JACK Huh. 
Stephanie leans forward and signals to Maya with a YAWN or a GAGGING FINGER IN MOUTH that they hightail it. Although Miles protests at first, they stand and leave. 
AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM -- 
Stephanie finds a DOOR which she tests to see whether it is open. It is! She leads her pals furtively inside -- 
INT. WINEMAKING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
This is an enormous, dimly-lit chamber filled with stainless steel FERMENTATION TANKS and stacks of OAK BARRELS. 
As the two couples walk in the near-darkness, they are entranced. Maya takes Miles's hand and leads him away. 
LATER -- 
In the background, Stephanie and Jack lean against a tank, kissing. 
CAMERA DOLLIES to reveal Miles and Maya among the barrels in the foreground. They are shy with each other, on the verge of kissing but holding back. 
THE MUSIC CONTINUES... 
INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
THREE BOTTLES OF WINE sit empty on the coffee table. 
WIDE -- 
The four friends sit on the floor around the coffee table. They drink wine and pass a JOINT. Suddenly they explode in LAUGHTER. 
A sleepy Siena appears at the hallway door rubbing her eyes. Stephanie gets up, but Jack stops her, gathers Siena in his arms, and takes her back to bed. 
EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The Saab pulls away from the house. 
INT. SAAB - NIGHT 
Miles sits in his own passenger seat as Maya tries her hand at the Saab. 
EXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Maya leads Miles up her back stairway. They're both a little woozy from the hours of drinking. 
AT THE DOOR -- 
Maya searches through her purse for her keys while Miles hovers directly behind her, staring at her ear. Her ear? 
Just as Maya puts the key in the lock, he impulsively leans forward to kiss the nape of her neck. Maya's reaction is immediate -- she turns to embrace Miles, giving him a long KISS. Then she opens the door, pulls him inside and closes the door in our face. 
The camera PANS to the nearby ROOFTOPS. 
MUSIC ENDS AND SLOW DISSOLVE TO: 
THE SAME VIEW BY DAY, SUPERIMPOSED WITH -- 
THURSDAY 
The CAMERA PANS back to Maya's door, tilting down to find a blue-wrapped NEW YORK TIMES. The door opens, and Maya's hand picks up the newspaper. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Maya inside to -- 
INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
It is a small, clean apartment furnished with simple taste. 
Maya is dressed in a ROBE and holds a COFFEE MUG. She drops the paper on the dining table and continues into -- 
THE BEDROOM -- 
where Miles lies on his stomach DEAD TO THE WORLD. His stubbly face is squished against the mattress and he SNORES lightly. 
Maya looks at him for a moment before shaking his foot. 
EXT. FARMERS' MARKET - DAY 
This is a weekly event in a big PARKING LOT -- organic produce, candles and incense, honey and cider. 
JACK What? 
MILES It's private. 
JACK You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot. 
MILES Let's leave it alone. 
Jack looks at Miles, his face frozen with incomprehension. 
JACK You didn't get any, did you? (off Miles's silence) You're a homo. 
MILES Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up. 
JACK Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry. 
Miles begins to calm down. Jack grows concerned and sensitively puts one arm around his friend. 
JACK Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's... 
MILES Shut up! Shut up, Jack! 
The phone RINGS and both men look at it, silenced by the ominous sound. 
MILES Don't answer it. 
But Jack is drawn to it as though enticed by a strange game of Russian roulette. 
MILES I'm telling you, don't. 
Jack picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear. 
JACK Hello? Oh, hey, honey. How you doing? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (mouthing) Christine. 
Miles lies on his bed and clamps both hands over his ears. His face is dark with resentment. 
JACK Listen, honey. Let me call you back. Miles and I are in the middle of something. No, it's nothing serious -- Miles is just having one of his freak- outs. Yeah. Love you too. I'll call you right back. 
Jack hangs up. 
MILES This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to. (deadly serious) I want to go home. 
JACK Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me. 
MILES We gotta slow down. (closing his eyes) I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here. 
JACK I know what you need. 
INT. SEARS - DAY 
Jack watches Miles be fitted for SNEAKERS. A SALES ASSOCIATE ties Miles's laces. 
SALES ASSOCIATE There you go. 
Miles gets up and walks in a circle. 
MILES Do you like them? 
JACK Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty. 
MILES Are they too sporty? 
INT. MALL - DAY 
The boys exit Sears, Miles wearing his new shoes and carrying a PLASTIC BAG with a string handle. 
JACK Feel better? 
Miles shrugs. 
JACK (noticing something) Oh here, wait a second. I want to run in here real quick. 
He heads toward a TOYS STORE. 
JACK (over his shoulder) I want to get something for Siena. 
Mildly concerned, Miles watches Jack go into the store. 
INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY 
Miles is slumped in the passenger seat as Jack drives. They pass a BIG COMMERCIAL WINERY. Jack slows down, preparing to turn in. 
JACK How about this one? We didn't hit this one. 
MILES Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke. 
JACK You ever actually been in there, Miles? 
MILES I don't have to. 
JACK (turning the wheel) I say we check it out. You never know. 
EXT. LARGE WINERY PARKING LOT - DAY 
The Saab finds a place in the large parking lot. A TOUR BUS, whose flank reads "Solvang Wine Tours," is in the process of letting out WINE TOURISTS, many of them elderly. 
INT. LARGE WINERY - DAY 
The room boasts not only a large TASTING BAR but also display after display of t-shirts, golf shirts, olive oils, chocolate sauces and other gourmet tourist items emblazoned with the winery's logo. 
In the corner an ACOUSTIC GUITARIST with a small amp plays soothing Windham Hill-ish music. 
The pourer signals to a SECURITY GUY at the door. Across the room Jack notices the disturbance and heads over. 
Miles hoists up the SPIT BUCKET, holds it aloft and starts to GUZZLE it. Wine cascades down the sides of his face, onto his shirt and even onto his shiny new shoes. 
The Security Guy yanks the bucket away from Miles, and drags him toward the EXIT. Jack catches up. 
JACK (to the horrified onlookers) It's all right. His mother just died. 
EXT. BEACH - DAY 
Two PELICANS soar low over the water. One of the DIVES, crashing into the water and disappearing from view. 
Jack and Miles sit on the hood of the Saab, gazing at the ocean, sharing a bottle of wine. 
JACK Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right? 
MILES No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary. (a dark laugh) I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself. 
JACK What's that supposed to mean? 
MILES You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published. 
JACK What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is. 
MILES Thanks. 
JACK Don't give up. You're going to make it. 
MILES Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage. 
JACK See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that. 
MILES Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski. 
Unable to respond, Jack looks up and down the beach. 
EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY 
ZOOM! There goes the Saab. 
The CAMERA lingers behind and PANS to reveal THE DEAD DOG, now covered with FLIES AND MAGGOTS. 
EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY 
Jack and Miles pull into the parking lot. 
JACK (lighting up) Oh, look. There's Steph! 
He smiles broadly and honks his horn. Miles turns to see -- 
STEPHANIE 
seated halfway up on the motel stairs, her HELMET in her lap, watching patiently as -- 
THE SAAB 
pulls to a stop in a parking space. 
Miles masks his concern as he gets out of the car and reaches in the backseat for his Sears bag. 
JACK (calling out) Hey, baby. 
Stephanie stands up and slowly descends the steps, as Jack reaches into the trunk and pulls out a BIG CUDDLY LION DOLL. 
JACK Look what I got for our favorite girl. 
Stephanie walks toward Jack as he waddles toward her hugging the lion. When they get close, Stephanie's face transforms with rage. 
STEPHANIE YOU MOTHERFUCKER! 
She swings her helmet and HITS JACK FULL IN THE FACE. 
Jack falls, blood spraying out of his nose. Stephanie stands over him and continues to BEAT HIM with her helmet as he rolls back and forth, protecting his head with the stuffed lion. 
Miles ineffectually attempts to stop her, dancing just out of range. 
MILES Stephanie! Stop! 
STEPHANIE You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me? 
JACK I can explain. 
STEPHANIE You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die! 
With that she backs away. Glancing at her bloodied helmet, she tosses it onto the pavement before getting on her bike. 
STEPHANIE Fuckface! (to Miles) You too! 
As she speeds away, Miles is left to comfort his wounded friend. The lion lies nearby, staring blankly at the sky. 
INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY 
Seated in the passenger seat and in great agony, Jack presses a BLOOD-SOAKED TOWEL against his face. 
MILES Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her? 
JACK Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you? 
MILES No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night. 
JACK You told him. I'm fucking hurting here. 
NOW TWO PLATES ARRIVE 
mounded high with ribs, slaw, beans and butter-whipped mashed potatoes. 
JACK Mm. Mm. 
Their cheery, saftig blonde WAITRESS removes several FOIL PACKETS from her apron and places them on the table. 
WAITRESS And here're your Handi-wipes. 
JACK Oh, so that's what those are? For a second there I thought you guys were promoting safe sex. 
The waitress OVER-LAUGHS and swipes a hand at her naughty customer. 
WAITRESS I'll be right back with more corn bread. 
Jack watches her go and leans in close to Miles. 
JACK I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type. 
MILES I don't know. I wouldn't know. 
Now she comes back toward the table carrying a BIG BASKET. Beneath the hideous uniform, her nylons SH-SH-SH as she walks. When she arrives, she replenishes their corn bread basket using big TONGS. Jack watches attentively. 
JACK Nice technique there... (checking her name tag) ...Cammi. 
CAMMI It's all in the wrist. (a moment later) You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school? 
JACK No, we're from San Diego. Why? 
CAMMI I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals. 
JACK Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby? 
CAMMI Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"? 
Miles looks away and sighs. 
JACK You have to imagine him with a bandage and shorter hair. 
As Cammi stares at Jack, her face transforms in astonishment. 
CAMMI No. Way. No way! 
Jack smiles and nods. 
CAMMI Oh, my God! 
MILES Could you tell me where the bathroom is? 
CAMMI (her eyes barely leaving Jack) Uh, sure, it's right over there, right past the buffalo. 
IN A WIDE SHOT -- 
Miles gets up and heads toward the bathroom as Jack's flirtation with Cammi continues. 
The camera PANS with Miles as he walks by us and goes through the bathroom door, which closes behind him, filling the frame with the word "MEN." 
LATER -- 
A TOOTHPICK DISPENSER as a finger tips it forward to dispense one. 
WIDER -- 
Miles stands by the cash register and PICKS HIS TEETH as he watches Jack finish speaking with Cammi and head his way. 
JACK She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe. 
MILES You're joking, right? (seeing that he isn't) What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home? 
Jack rests one hand on Miles's shoulder and drops his head, thinking how best to put it. 
JACK Look, Miles. I know you're my friend and you care about me. And I know you disapprove. I respect that. But there are some things I have to do that you don't understand. You understand wine and literature and movies, but you don't understand my plight. And that's okay. 
CLOSE ON MILES -- 
as the disappointment in his friend deepens by the moment. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
UNDER BLACK, SUPERIMPOSED -- 
FRIDAY 
Now comes the sound of hysterical KNOCKING. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAWN 
Despite the knocking, Miles remains motionless in bed, his expression serene. 
Finally he awakens and drags himself toward the door, opening it to find -- 
JACK 
silhouetted against the first rosy fingers of dawn. He is barefoot. In fact he is clad only in his UNDERWEAR. Hugging himself, he PANTS and SHIVERS. 
JACK Jesus fucking Christ, it's freezing. 
He limps past Miles, yanks off the bed covers and wraps them around himself. 
JACK Vicodin. Where's the Vicodin? My nose. 
MILES creeps over, sticks his hand into the open space and pulls back the curtain to reveal -- 
A LIVING ROOM the is hideously MESSY. Draped over a deformed beanbag chair are JACK'S LEVI'S. 
Miles gathers his courage, carefully slides open the glass door, and creeps inside. 
INT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
A furtive search of Jack's pockets reveals NOTHING. Then Miles notices a HIGH-PITCHED SOUND wafting from an open door down a short HALLWAY. 
Miles feverishly begins foraging through the debris on the floor. Again nothing. Meanwhile the noise from the bedroom grows louder -- female MOANING in odd rhythmic unison with a MAN'S VOICE. 
IN THE HALLWAY -- 
Miles gets on ALL FOURS and starts crawling, weaving his way through a trail of shoes and clothes. 
Nearing the open door, the sounds grow more distinct -- 
MAN You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you. 
CAMMI I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl. 
Miles peers around the corner of the open door to see -- 
INT. CAMMI'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Cammi is TIED to the faux brass headboard. A BIG GUY slams away at her. In the corner a soundless TV shows a PRESIDENTIAL PRESS CONFERENCE. 
MAN You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch? 
CAMMI I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl. 
MAN And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore? 
CAMMI I liked it when you caught me fucking him. 
Whoa! 
Miles manages to tear his eyes away from this nature documentary and scan the room. 
IRIS IN -- 
to the WALLET atop the dresser. 
Miles's eyes dart back and forth between the couple and the wallet. His HEART BEATING LOUDLY, he goes for it. He scrambles to his feet, dashes across the room, seizes the wallet and tears out. Behind him he hears -- 
MAN (O.S.) The fuck was that? 
CAMMI (O.S.) The wallet! He took Derek's wallet! 
EXT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Miles comes flying out of the sliding glass door, followed swiftly by the man, who is of course STARK NAKED. And he's fast for a man his size. 
CAMMI (O.S.) Get him! 
INT. SAAB - MORNING 
Jack is reclined in the passenger seat FAST ASLEEP. On the radio NPR'S CARL KASSEL reads the news. 
THROUGH THE DRIVER'S WINDOW -- 
Miles comes sprinting towards us, mere steps ahead of Cammi's naked husband. Finding the car door locked, Miles knocks loudly on the glass, startling Jack awake. 
MILES Open up! Jesus! Open the goddamn door! 
Jack flips the electric locks just in time for Miles to get in before -- 
WHUMP! The guy's BELLY hits the window. He pounds on the roof before trying the door, now re-locked. 
MAN You motherfuckers! I'll kill you! I'll kill you motherfuckers! 
Miles starts the car and begins to drive away. The guy tries to keep up but can't, running barefoot on asphalt. Jack turns to look -- 
OUT THE BACK WINDOW -- 
The guy recedes in the distance. 
JACK 
removes the rings from the wallet. 
JACK You did it! You fucking did it! 
They LAUGH and SLAP HANDS. 
CLOSE ON MILES -- 
For all his failures, this time he did something right. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY 
The shades are drawn. Jack is CRASHED OUT on the bed, snoring loudly. Miles folds his shirts and trousers -- readying his bags for departure. 
At one moment he stops and watches his friend sleep. 
A KNOCK at the door. Miles goes to answer it, but once his hand is on the knob, he pauses. If we're perceptive, we will know he's hoping against hope that it's Maya. 
He opens it. It's just the MAID with her big CART. 
MAID Housekeeping.

SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE 
by Marc Norman & Tom Stoppard 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY. 
SKY. Over which a title "LONDON--SUMMER 1593" appears. Title card: In the glory days of the Elizabethan theatre two playhouses were fighting it out for writers and audiences. North of the city was the Curtain Theatre, home to England's most famous actor, Richard Burbage. Across the river was the competition, built by Philip Henslowe, a business with a cash flow problem... 
...The Rose... 
Gradually a building is revealed, The Rose Theatre, three- tiered, open to the elements and empty. On the floor, roughly printed, a poster--torn, soiled, out of date. It says: 
SEPT. 7TH & 8TH AT NOON 
MR. EDWARD ALLEYN AND THE ADMIRAL'S MEN AT THE ROSE THEATRE, BANKSIDE 
THE LAMENTABLE TRAGEDIE OF THE MONEYLENDER REVENG'D 
OVER THIS the screams of a man under torture. The screams are coming from the curtained stage. 
VOICE (O.S.) You Mongrel! Why do you howl When it is I who am bitten? 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. 
The theatre owner, PHILLIP HENSLOWE, is the man screaming. HENSLOWE'S boots are on fire. He is pinioned in a chair, with his feet stuck out over the hot colas of a fire burning in a brazier. He is being held in that position by LAMBERT, who is a thug employed by FENNYMAN, who is the owner of the VOICE. The fourth man, FREES, is FENNYMAN'S bookkeeper. 
FENNYMAN What am I, Mr. Lambert? 
LAMBERT Bitten, Mr. Fennyman. 
FENNYMAN How badly bitten, Mr. Frees? 
FREES Twelve pounds, one shilling and four pence, Mr. Fennyman, including interest. 
HENSLOWE Aaagh! I can pay you! 
FENNYMAN When? 
HENSLOWE Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake. 
FENNYMAN Take his feet out. Where will you get 
FREES (the mathematical genius with a notebook) Sixteen pounds, five shillings and nine pence 
FENNYMAN including interest in three weeks? 
HENSLOWE I have a wonderful new play! 
FENNYMAN Put his feet in. 
HENSLOWE It's a comedy. 
FENNYMAN Cut his nose off. 
HENSLOWE A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare! 
FENNYMAN And his ears. 
HENSLOWE And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman! 
FENNYMAN (hesitating) Partners! 
HENSLOWE It's a crowd-tickler--mistaken identities, a shipwreck, a pirate king, a bit with a dog, and love triumphant. 
LAMBERT I think I've seen it. I didn't like it. 
HENSLOWE This time it is by Shakespeare. 
FENNYMAN What's the title? 
HENSLOWE Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter. 
FENNYMAN Good title. 
FENNYMAN snaps his fingers at FREES and LAMBERT. LAMBERT unties HENSLOWE, FREES starts writing a contract. 
FENNYMAN (CONT'D) A play takes time. Find actors rehearsalslet's say open in three weeks. That's--what--five hundred groundlings at tuppence each, in addition four hundred groundlings tuppence each, in addition four hundred backsides at three pence--a penny extra for a cushion, call it two hundred cushions, say two performance for safety how much is that Mr. Frees? 
FREES Twenty pounds to the penny, Mr. Fennyman. 
FENNYMAN Correct! 
BURBAGE The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us. 
HENSLOWE And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you? 
BURBAGE Ask him. 
The Master of the Revels (TILNEY) comes through the curtain officiously. 
TILNEY She comes! 
He disappears back through the curtains. The hubbub falls silent, rather dramatically, and all the busy PLAYERS know what that means: they all crowd to the curtain and find places to peep through. 
INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. FRONT OF HOUSE/STAGE. DAY. 
THE POV OF THE PLAYERS. 
The arrival of QUEEN ELIZABETH, aged sixty, coming to take her place in the audience at front centre. The hill is crowded with lords and ladies, bowing ELIZABETH to her seat, which is raised high on a pedestal, affording the QUEEN an uninterrupted view of the play, and the audience an uninterrupted view of the QUEEN. Trumpets sound. 
Close on a small piece of paper: a quill is writing "W. Shakespeare." WILL rolls the paper up carefully and slips it into the mouth of the snake bangle. 
The curtain draws back and CONDELL as "VALENTINE" and BURBAGE as "PROTEUS" begin the play. 
CONDELL AS VALENTINE "Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus; Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits" 
INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. THE WINGS/BACKSTAGE. DAY. 
With BURBAGES'S presence accounted for on stage, ROSALINE curls an arm around WILL'S neck. They kiss hungrily. After a moment, WILL pulls back. 
ROSALINE When will you write me a sonnet, Will? 
WILL I have lost my gift. 
ROSALINE You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again. 
WILL Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE? 
ROSALINE Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart. 
WILL takes the snake bracelet and slips it onto her arm. ROSALINE looks at it, then at WILL. Then they kiss again, but WILL is distracted by the sound of coughing from the auditorium. 
WILL You see? The consumptives plot against me. "Will Shakespeare has a play, let us go and cough through it." 
INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. STAGE. DAY. 
"VALENTINE" is on stage with "PROTEUS." 
CONDELL AS VALENTINE 
"To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans: Coy looks with heart sore sighs; One fading moment's mirth With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights" 
As the scene continues, WILL appears at the back of the hall and finds himself next to HENSLOWE. 
WILL I feel a scene coming on. 
HENSLOWE Is it about a pirate's daughter? 
INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BACK OF THE BANQUETING HALL/STAGE. DAY. 
Laughter. It is later, and KEMPE is now on stage with his dog. The audience is roaring. 
HENSLOWE You see? Comedy. 
QUEEN ELIZABETH'S idiosyncratic laugh rises above the others. 
QUEEN Well played, Master Crab, I commend you. 
She throws a sweetheart on the stage and the dog wolfs it down. Everyone applauds. 
HENSLOWE Love and a bit with a dog, that's what they like. 
Now we meet VIOLA. VIOLA DE LESSEPS is twenty-five and beautiful, and she is laughing with great natural enjoyment. She sits slightly apart from her small family group--her parents, SIR ROBERT DE LESSEPS and LADY MARGARET DE LESSEPS. Part of the group but seated behind as befits her lower status is VIOLA'S NURSE. 
Elsewhere is LORD WESSEX, our villain. WESSEX is in his forties, dark cruel, self-important. He has noticed VIOLA. The nurse notices him. 
INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. FRONT OF HOUSE/STAGE. DAY. 
LATER. "VALENTINE" is on stage alone. He is speaking the speech rather more coarsely than the version we hear later. 
CONDELL AS VALENTINE "What light is light if Silvia be not seen? What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by? Unless it be to think that she is by And feed upon the shadow of perfection" 
Now we see that VIOLA knows the speech by heart, and is silently mouthing it with the actor. 
MESSENGER The theatres are reopened. By order of the Master of the Revels, the theatres are reopened 
FENNYMAN is intrigued. 
FREES Mr. Fennyman! Mr. Tilney has opened the playhouses. 
FENNYMAN Yes I heard. 
HENSLOWE plays his temporary advantage modestly, shrugging himself free of LAMBERT'S grip. 
HENSLOWE (to LAMBERT) If you wouldn't mind 
HENSLOWE continues on his way. FENNYMAN watches HENSLOWE, curious. 
FENNYMAN Where is the play? 
HENSLOWE Oh, it's coming, it's coming. 
INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY. 
It is. WILL is writing furiously. A burnt-down candle is still alight, although it is day outside the window. He has been writing all night. He has written about ten pages. Pleased with himself and excited, he gathers them up and leaves the room like a man with a mission. 
EXT. WILL'S HOUSE. DAY. 
Leaving the house, pages in hand, WILL nearly knocks down HENSLOWE who has come to see him. 
HENSLOWE Will! The theatres are 
Before he can finish, WILL brandishes the pages in his hand. 
WILL Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good! 
HENSLOWE Rosaline? You mean Ethel. 
WILL has gone. 
EXT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY. 
BURBAGE lives in another part of the city. WILL bangs through the door without ceremony. 
WILL (shouting) Richard! 
INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY. 
WILL enters and calls out. 
WILL Burbage? 
INT. BURBAGE'S BEDROOM. DAY. 
WILL charges into the bedroom. ROSALINE is in bed. The Master of the Revels is pulling up his breeches. WILL is shattered. 
WILL Mr. Tilney 
The unsuccessful snake bracelet glints at him from ROSALINE'S arm. 
TILNEY Like you, I found him not at home! 
WILL So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men. 
ROSALINE Will! 
WILL (to ROSALINE) I would have made you immortal. (turning to go) Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare. 
TILNEY What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe. 
WILL You have opened the playhouses? 
TILNEY I have, Master Shakespeare. 
WILL But the plague 
TILNEY (sighs) Yes, I know. But he was always hanging around the house. 
A bell can be heard ringing outside. 
ROSALINE (to WILL, leaving) Willyou're the only one, Will!--in my heart. 
EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY. 
WILL emerges looking distraught. A burning brazier stands by the wall. WILL thrusts the pages into the coals. He watches for a moment as the pages catch fire. 
Her mother LADY DE LESSEPS, is talking to the NURSE. 
LADY DE LESSEPS 
Where is she? Our guests are upon us, Lord Wessex too, bargaining for a bride. My husband will have it settled tonight. 
Behind her, the door opens revealing VIOLA as THOMAS to the NURSES view, but only for a moment. The door closes again as LADY DE LESSEPS turns. 
LADY DE LESSEPS (CONT'D) Tomorrow he drags me off to the country and it will be three weeks gone before we return from our estates. 
A different door communicating to the next room, opens and VIOLA comes in after a lightning dress change into a robe. She curtseys to her mother. 
VIOLA God save you, mother. (to NURSE) Ho water, nurse. 
The NURSE looks at her, round-eyed. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. KITCHEN. DAY. 
From a cauldron on the stove, hot water is poured into two pails, by the a KITCHEN BOY under the NURSE'S command. 
SCULLERY MAID (O.S.) Thomas Kent, sir? No sir. 
WILL (O.S.) The actor 
NURSE Who asks for him? 
WILL has come to the kitchen door with a letter. 
WILL William Shakespeare, actor, poet, and playwright of the Rose. 
The NURSE sends the SCULLERY MAID back to work. 
NURSE Master Kent ismy nephew. 
WILL (giving her the letter) I will wait. 
NURSE Much god may it do you. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BATHROOM. EVENING. 
VIOLA in her bath, reads WILL'S letter. The NURSE is adding hot water to the tub. 
VIOLA (delighted) He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona. 
NURSE (unimpressed) Verona again. 
VIOLA (devouring the letter) A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King! 
EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT. 
WILL waits hopefully. The kitchen door opens and a SERVANT flings a bucket of dirty water in the general direction of the gutter. WILL hops nimbly aside and escapes a soaking. 
SERVANT Be off! 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
The NURSE is helping VIOLA into her party dress. 
NURSE Your mother, and your father 
VIOLA (gaily) From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome? 
NURSE He looks well enough for a mountebank. 
VIOLA Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming. 
NURSE (firmly) My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell. 
VIOLA (twice as firmly) You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig! 
EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT. 
WILL spots a gaggle of MUSICIANS approaching, carrying instruments. WILL recognizes them. 
WILL Master Plum! What business here? 
MUSICIAN A five shilling business, Will. We play for the dancing. 
The sound of hooves gives hardly any warning as a GALLOPING HORSEMAN thunders through the MUSICIANS who have to leap out of the way. It is WESSEX arriving at the house, with his usual good manners. Will watches WESSEX skid to a halt and enter the house. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. BANQUETING ROOM. NIGHT. 
The NURSE calls "Madam!" from inside the room. 
VIOLA Anon, good nurse. Anon. (to WILL) Master Shakespeare?! 
WILL The same, alas. 
VIOLA Oh but why "alas?" 
WILL A lowly player. 
VIOLA Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart. 
WILL Oh--I am him too! 
The NURSE calls again. 
VIOLA (to NURSE) Anon, anon! (to WILL) I will come again. 
She goes inside for a moment. 
WILL (to himself) Oh, I am fortune's fool, I will be punished for this! 
VIOLA returns. WILL comes forward again. 
WILL (CONT'D) Oh my lady, my love! 
VIOLA If they find you here they will kill you. 
WILL You can bring them with a word. 
VIOLA Oh, not for the world! 
The NURSE calls her again: "Madam!" 
VIOLA (CONT'D) Anon, nurse! 
But she goes inside. WILL looks around and sees that there is, as ever a convenient tree. He starts to climb up toward the balcony. When his head is nearly level, a soft figure comes once more onto the balcony. WILL pops his head over the parapet and is face to face with the NURSE. The NURSE gives a yell. WILL falls out of the tree. 
EXT. DE LEESEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT. 
Male voice shout to each other inside the house, candle flames appear in different windows, the garden door is flung open, revealing SIR ROBERT with candelabra in one hand and sword in the other. By this time WILL is on top of the garden wall and he drops safely out of sight. He could have written it better. 
INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAWN. 
WILL is burning the midnight oil--literally and metaphorically. His quill has already covered a dozen sheets. He is inspired. 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY. 
It is day one. THE COMPANY is on stage. PETER is passing pages around a bunch of actors. JOHN, JAMES, and NOL are looking through their pages. 
JOHN "Draw if you be men! (to JAMES) Gregory, remember thy washing blow." 
NOL "Part, fools, put up your swords." 
WILL is going around pumping hands and slapping shoulders, flushed with excitement. HENSLOWE is reading his pages, worried. RALPH BASHFORD is next to him. 
HENSLOWE It starts well, and then it's all long- faced about some Rosaline. Where's the comedy, Will. Where's the dog? (to RALPH) Do you think it is funny? 
RALPH I was a Pirate King, now I'm a Nurse. That's funny 
WILL pulls HENSLOWE aside. 
WILL We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster. 
HENSLOWE We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster. 
WILL as notices a young scruffy thirteen-year-old actor, the URCHIN we met before. 
WILL Who are you, master? 
URCHIN I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter. 
WILL (furiously) I'll be damned if you are! 
And he helps the URCHIN off with a kick. The URCHIN glowers with resentment. HENSLOWE finds himself face to face with FENNYMAN. 
FENNYMAN Is it going well? 
HENSLOWE Very well. 
FENNYMAN But nothing is happening. 
The URCHIN nods grimly. 
URCHIN I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives. 
WILL Oh. What is your name? 
URCHIN. John Webster. Here, kitty, kitty. 
Because a stray cat is nearby. The cat show an interest. The URCHIN passes a white mouse to the cat and watches the result with sober interest. 
URCHIN (CONT'D) Plenty of blood. That is the only writing. 
WILL backs away, unnerved by the boy. 
URCHIN (CONT'D) Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off. 
WILL I have to get back. 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY. 
On stage . . . the actors carry their parts. 
NOL AS BENVOLIO 
"See where he comes. So please you step aside; I'll know his grievance or be much denied." 
MONTAGUE "I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away." 
Onstage "MONTAGUE" and "LADY MONTAGUE" make their exit. Offstage, WILL appears next to HENSLOWE. 
WILL Cut round him for now. 
HENSLOWE (not understanding) What? Who? 
WILL Romeo. 
HENSLOWE The one who came with your letter? 
WILL What? 
NOL AS BENVOLIO (O.S.) "Good morrow, cousin." 
VIOLA AS ROMEO (O.S.) "Is the day so young?" 
The voice is THOMAS'S. WILL turns back to the stage and sees him. Today THOMAS has a wig as well as his small mustache. 
NOL AS BENVOLIO "But new struck nine." 
VIOLA AS ROMEO "Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?" 
NOL AS BENVOLIO It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?" 
VIOLA AS ROMEO "Not having that which, having, makes them short." 
WILL Good 
NOL AS BENVOLIO "In love?" 
VIOLA AS ROMEO "Out." 
NOL AS BENVOLIO "Of love?" 
VIOLA AS ROMEO "Out of her favour where I am in love." 
WILL (interrupting) No, no, noDon't spend it all at once! 
The rehearsal stops. 
VIOLA AS THOMAS Yes, sir. 
WILL Do you understand me? 
VIOLA AS THOMAS No, sir. 
WILL He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet? 
HENSLOWE Juliet? You mean Ethel. 
WILL (rounding on him) God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?! (to THOMAS) What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life? 
VIOLA AS THOMAS (timidly--looking through his few sheets of paper) I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two. 
VIOLA (CONT'D) I do not know how to undress a man. 
WILL It is strange to me, too. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
The NURSE has come to listen. She puts her ear against the door. Because she hears muffled voices, she looks startled. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
WILL is half-naked. VIOLA is down to her petticoat, and chemise. The petticoat comes away. WILL flings it aside. He takes off her chemise. He is startled to find that she is tightly bandaged round the bosom. WILL finds the loose end and spins her naked. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
The NURSE, drags a chair--a rocker--outside the bedroom door, and takes up her position. She sits down, keeping guard. Pretty soon there comes the regular creak of VIOLA'S bed. The NURSE fans herself furiously with her little lacy fan. She crosses herself. A CHAMBERMAID comes along the gallery outside the bedroom door. She is dusting her way along. The CHAMBERMAID becomes aware of the regular creaking. She pauses. The NURSE begins to rock in her chair, keeping time with the creaking from within. The CHAMBERMAID stares at the NURSE. The NURSE stares at the CHAMBERMAID. 
NURSE Go to, go to. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 
WILL and VIOLA have finished making love, and lie in each other's arms. 
VIOLA I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play. 
WILL There is. 
VIOLA Even your play. 
WILL (frowns) Oh 
VIOLA And that was only my first try. 
WILL Well perhaps better than my first. (he kisses her again) 
EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAWN. 
Dawn is breaking. The sun lacing the severing clouds with envious streaks. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAWN 
The NURSE has fallen asleep in her rocking chair. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAWN. 
A rooster crows at some distance. VIOLA and WILL are in bed. She stirs drowsily. VIOLA, coming awake, speaks his name and he kisses her. 
VIOLA Will 
Then he starts to get out of bed. 
VIOLA (CONT'D) You would not leave me? 
WILL I must. Look-- how pale the window. 
VIOLA (pulling him down) Moonlight! 
WILL No, the morning rooster woke me. 
VIOLA It was the owl--come to bed 
She is winning. She kisses him and pulls the bedclothes around them. 
WILL (giving in) Oh, let Henslowe wait. 
VIOLA (pausing, pushing him away) Mr. Henslowe? 
WILL (persisting) Let him be damned for his pages! 
VIOLA Oh--no, no! 
WILL (kissing her) There is time. It is still dark. 
VIOLA It is broad day! (the rooster crows again) The rooster tells us so! 
WILL It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl. 
He kisses her and starts to make love to her again. VIOLA gives him a shove which pushes him onto the floor. She sits up and pulls on her gown. 
VIOLA You would leave us players without a scene to read today?! 
There's a knock at the door. 
NOL AS BENVOLIO (to ROMEO) "Away, be gone, the sport is at best." 
VIOLA, about to make her exit, has her hand holding the curtain at the gap. 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY. 
WILL is kissing her hand. 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. 
VIOLA AS ROMEO "Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest." 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY. 
VIOLA comes through the curtain. WILL and VIOLA kiss, dangerously--they are in a narrow space, hidden from the general backstage area. 
SAM AS JULIET (O.S.) "Come hither nurse. What is yond gentleman?" 
VIOLA (to Will) Oh let it be night! 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. 
RALPH AS NURSE "I know not." 
SAM AS JULIET "Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed." 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY. 
"JULIET'S" line bits WILL between the eyes. WILL pulls away. 
VIOLA Oh, do not go 
WILL I must. I must 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY. 
As WILL races up the ladder to his writer's corner, the rehearsal can be heard continuing. 
RALPH AS NURSE (O.S.) "His name is Romeo, and a Montague, The only son of your great enemy." 
ALLEYN (O.S.) (roaring from the audience) Terrible! 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY. 
WILL arrives at the top of the building in his writer's corner. He spins around once in a circle, rubs his hands together and spits on the floor. His manuscript is all over the table. We take a peak at the lines he has already written. INSERT MANUSCRIPT: "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun." VIOLA'S VOICE OVER speaks the line. 
VIOLA (VO) "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun!" 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING. 
VIOLA (reading) "Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon Who is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair than she" 
VIOLA is in bed, reading the lines from the manuscript page. WILL is in bed with her, reading with her. 
VIOLA (CONT'D) Oh, Will! 
WILL Yes, some of it is speakable. 
She has to speak through WILL'S kisses, he is nibbling at her neck and shoulders and she has to bat him away with the pages. 
VIOLA (continuing reading) "It is my lady, O it is my love! O that she knew she were!" 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. 
VIOLA continues the speech, edge-to-edge, now in rehearsal, with SAM as "JULIET" sighing on the balcony above her. 
VIOLA AS ROMEO "The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek. 
SAM AS JULIET (above) "Ay me." 
VIOLA AS ROMEO "She speaks. 
Oh speak again bright angel" 
We have abandoned real time. The scene continues CROSS CUT between the STAGE and VIOLA'S BED. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING. 
WILL (reading through VIOLA'S kisses) "Oh Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name." 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. 
SAM AS JULIET "Stay but a little, I will come again." 
SAM leaves the balcony through the curtain. 
VIOLA AS ROMEO "Oh blessed blessed night." 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
It is night. They have just made love. Suddenly it is very still. 
VIOLA (almost to herself) "I am feared, 
Being in night, all this but a dream, Too flattering- sweet to be substantial." 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY. 
Onstage, the scene continues. Backstage NED ALLEYN is working his way upstairs. He passes by RALPH (the Nurse) who has a couple of words "of," as it were, in "JULIET'S" chamber. 
SAM AS JULIET (O.S.) "All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world." 
RALPH AS NURSE "Madam!" 
SAM AS JULIET (O.S.) "I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--" 
RALPH AS NURSE "Madam!" 
SAM AS JULIET (O.S.) By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!" 
SAM exits (i.e. enters to us) through the curtain. 
SAM (to NED) I cannot move in this dress! and it makes me look like a pig! I have no neck in this pig dress! (and then hearing his cue from "ROMEO") Oh, she's off again! She says she's going and then she doesn't 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY. 
NED is arriving. WILL is busy writing. PETER is there, holding the pages WILL has completed, and waiting for WILL to finish his page. PETER is reading his pages. WILL sees NED arrive. He gives his page to PETER. 
WILL (to PETER) How is it? 
PETER (shrugs) It's all right. 
Typical!, says WILL'S face. Peter departs, leaving the field to NED. WILL braces himself. 
WILL NedI knowI know 
ALLEYN It's good. 
WILL Oh 
ALLEYN The title won't do. 
WILL Ah 
ALLEYN Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion. 
WILL Thank you, Ned. 
The whole exchange is in ironic code, between old soldiers. NED nods curtly and turns to descend. 
WILL (CONT'D) You are a gentleman. 
ALLEYN And you are a Warwickshire shit-house. 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY. 
PETER is just handing the pages HENSLOWE in the auditorium. HENSLOWE has acquired a performing dog. The dog does somersaults tirelessly. As PETER hands over the pages, he shakes his head. 
HENSLOWE (in disbelief) You mean, no dog of any kind? 
FENNYMAN, the born-again theatre groupie shushes HENSLOWE and looks daggers at him. 
PETER (to HENSLOWE) The Friar married them in secret, then Ned gets into a fight with one of the Capulets, Romeo tries to stop them, he gets in Ned's way, I mean in Mercutio's way, so Tybalt kills Mercutio and then Romeo kills Tybalt. Then the Prince banishes him from Verona. 
HENSLOWE (much relieved) That must be when he goes on the voyage and gets shipwrecked on the island of the Pirate King. 
FENNYMAN can't hear it. He storms over. Kicks the dog, roars at HENSLOWE . 
FENNYMAN Cease your prattling! Get out! (to the stage where the action has paused) A thousand apologies! 
SAM AS JULIET "Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow." 
The way these royal routs work is that guest mill about, chatting, bowing and generally behaving gallantly, while QUEEN ELIZABETH creates a vortex around her as she passes through the throng, occasionally honouring somebody with a couple of words, until she arrives thankfully at the best chairwhere she establishes a headquarters. Her current LORD IN WAITING ferries the lucky few forward to a brief audience with the QUEEN, each giving way to the next. VIOLA and WESSEX are, respectively, dipping and bowing as they are greeted by people who know themWill, in close attendance, joins in gratuitously, bowing until VIOLA nudges him and reminds him to curtsey instead. The QUEEN'S LORD IN WAITING plucks WESSEX'S sleeve. 
WESSEX (to him) Now? 
LORD IN WAITING Now. 
WESSEX (to Viola) The Queen asks for you. Answer well. 
The LORD IN WAITING ushers VIOLA through the crowd. WILL starts to follow. WESSEX takes him by the arm. 
WESSEX (CONT'D) Is there a man? 
WILL A man, my lord? 
WESSEX (impatiently) There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house? 
WILL A theatre poet? 
WESSEX An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house? 
WILL Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry. 
WESSEX (venomously) That dog! 
ANGLE on the QUEEN. 
The LORD IN WAITING has presented VIOLA. VIOLA speaks from a frozen curtsey. 
VIOLA Your Majesty. 
QUEEN Stand up straight, girl. 
VIOLA straightens. The QUEEN examines her. 
QUEEN (CONT'D) I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond. 
VIOLA (agreeing) Your Majesty. 
QUEEN What do you love so much? 
VIOLA Your Majesty 
QUEEN Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love? 
VIOLA I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed 
QUEEN (interrupting) They are not acted for you, they are acted for me. 
VIOLA remains silent, in apology. 
ANGLE on WILL. 
He is watching and listening. He has never seen the QUEEN so close. He is fascinated. 
QUEEN (CONT'D) And--? 
VIOLA And I love poetry above all. 
QUEEN Above Lord Wessex? 
She looks over VIOLA'S shoulder and VIOLA realises WESSEX has moved up behind her. WESSEX bows. 
QUEEN (CONT'D) (to WESSEX) My Lord--when you cannot find your wife you had better look for her at the playhouse. 
The COURTIERS titter at her pleasantry. 
QUEEN (CONT'D) But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true. 
VIOLA (blurts) Oh, but they can! 
She has forgotten herself. The COURTIERS gasp. The QUEEN considers her. WESSEX looks furious. WILL is touched. 
VIOLA (CONT'D) I meanYour Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can 
WESSEX Lady Viola isyoung in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune. 
QUEEN I thought you were here because you had none. 
Titters again. WESSEX could kill somebody. 
QUEEN (CONT'D) (by way of dismissing him) Well, no one will take your wager, it seems. 
NED comes out of character. 
ALLEYN Are you going to do it like that? And before the humbled actor can reply NED continues. 
ALLEYN (AS MECUTIO) And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something, make it a word and a blow. 
But suddenly six more men and a dog invade the stage, ready to fight. BURBAGE and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN have arrived to avenge BURBAGE'S honour with swords, clubs, and a bucket (containing pig swill). 
BURBAGE Where is that thieving hack who can't keep his pen in his own ink pot!? 
WILL has already leapt up onto the stage. 
WILL What is this rabble?! 
BURBAGE aims a blow at WILL, who ducks and grabs a stave from the nearest actor, and parries the blow. He swings at BURBAGE, a CHAMBERLAIN'S MAN swings at WILL, THOMAS cries out, someone else slashes the stage hangings bringing down the drapes, and in a moment the ADMIRAL'S MEN and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN, using their much rehearsed skills, are brawling with weapons and fist, using everything short of unbuttoned rapiers. CRAB, the dog, is yapping and snapping at any legs he can reach. HENSLOWE, a little slow to catch up on the situation, checks the page in his hand. FENNYMAN, much slower to catch up, watches enthralled. 
FENNYMAN (to HENSLOWE) Wonderful, wonderful! And a dog! 
But now HENSLOWE has worked out that these actors don't belong, nor does the scene. he enters the fray, but his interest is protecting his property. Big burly RALPH is using a couple of unlit torches as weapons; he breaks one of them over an enemy's back and HENSLOWE turns on RALPH 
HENSLOWE Not with my props! 
VIOLA is doing well enough, tripping up an enemy with a well-judged stave, and then using it to deflect a blow aimed at WILL 
VIOLA Will! What--? 
WILL A literary feud. Quite normal. 
Then he is smashed over the head. He falls off the stage taking VIOLA with him. Under the stage is a space (known as Hell) and WILL shoves VIOLA into this space. 
WILL (CONT'D) Stay hid! 
He gets back onto the stage, where the goings on are worthy of the Four Musketeers and Robin Hood combined, with SAM GOSSE, dressed as "JULIET," fighting with the best of them. There is a stack of cushions, stored for the expensive seats, and as the stack s knocked over, NED ALLEYN and others grab cushions to use as shields. Soon cushions are being ripped, and the air is full of flying feathers. The trap door in the stage opens, VIOLA'S head pops up. She looks around and, surrounded by milling legs and floating feathers, a boot catches her sideways and half knocks her wig off. In danger of having her cover blown, she ducks down again, leaving the trap open just nicely for Will to plummet down it. 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. UNDER THE STAGE. DAY. 
WILL I dreamed last night of a shipwreck. You were cast ashore in a far country. 
They embrace and kiss. In a moment they are in a world of their own. 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. UNDER THE STAGE. DAY. 
The battle rages. FENNYMAN, alone now in the auditorium, continues to watch entranced. It's the greatest show he's ever seen. HENSLOWE is desperately trying to rescue odd props that have been seconded to the fight. Someone picks up a tree that is to be used in Romeo. HENSLOWE yells. 
HENSLOWE We need that for the balcony scene! 
FENNYMAN notices this, and it rings a distant bell. He looks around the realises that some of these faces are unfamiliar. The tree comes crashing down on RALPH'S head. FENNYMAN looks at HENSLOWE. 
HENSLOWE (CONT'D) (in despair) My poor Rose! 
He collapses on to a broken bench. FENNYMAN comes over to him, grabs the script pages from his pocket, and consults them to confirm what he has now begun to suspect: that this scene is not in them. 
FENNYMAN (horrified) My investment! LAMBERT!!! 
LAMBERT has been sleeping peacefully through this, but wakes to his master's call. 
FENNYMAN (CONT'D) (points at the fray) VENGEANCE! 
HENSLOWE attempts to intervene. 
HENSLOWE I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business 
FENNYMAN Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business 
And he delivers a telling blow to a passing CHAMBERLAIN'S MAN, who wheels off the stage. LAMBERT meanwhile is making short work of the rest of the opposition, receiving help with the thorny business of identification from SAM. Stray members of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN are running from the theatre, as BURBAGE, fighting a heroic last stand, is tipped backwards by FENNYMAN off the stage and into a bucket of swill. A PAUSE. Then NED starts applauding. The others, weary from fighting, start applauding too, from all levels of the theatre. FENNYMAN looks around, starting to beam, as a din of encores and bravos engulf him. A star! 
INT. BROTHEL. NIGHT. 
The victorious army of actors bursts into the brothel, FENNYMAN at their head. He owns the brothel. The place is already crowded with WHORES and CUSTOMERS. It's a party. 
FENNYMAN (shouts) A famous victory! Kegs and legs. Open and on the house! Oh what happy hour! (and grabbing a RADDLED WHORE) Poxy Pol! You keep yourself to yourself I'll not have you infecting my investment! 
VIOLA AS THOMAS (looking around guardedly. To WILL) Is this a tavern? 
WILL It is also a tavern. 
WILL sits her down in THE COMPANY and takes the chair next to her A PRETTY WHORE immediately sits on WILL'S knee and kisses him. 
PRETTY WHORE I remember you! The poet! 
VIOLA furiously pulls the PRETTY WHORE off WILL'S lap. 
EXT. BROTHEL. NIGHT. 
WILL comes staggering out into the street. 
WILL It was I who killed him! God forgive me, God forgive me! 
He falls into a stagnant puddle, a deep gutter of water and garbage. He gets up and staggers on. 
EXT. CHURCH TOWER. NIGHT. 
A church tower looms up in the night sky. 
INT. CHURCH. NIGHT. 
This is where WILL has come. The church is empty, but for the demented, grieving figure of SHAKESPEARE, kneeling, praying, weeping, banging his head, in his private purgatory, dimly lit by tallow candles, gazed upon by effigies of the dead and images of his Redeemer. He is wet, bedraggled, weeds and leaves in his hair. 
EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY. 
A lovely sunny morning. The church bells are ringing. VIOLA and the NURSE, mounted, approach. VIOLA rides sidesaddle on a beautiful horse, and is followed, rather like Quixote by Sancho, by the NURSE on a less impressive animal. 
Riding in the opposite direction, is WESSEX. And what a happy day it is. He sings and hums to himself merrily. Here is a man who has heard wonderful news. He sees VIOLA and greets her merrily. 
WESSEX You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding. 
VIOLA It is not my riding day, my lord. 
WESSEX Bless me, I thought it was a horse. 
VIOLA I am going to church. 
WESSEX (recomposing his features to solemnity) I understand of course. It is to be expected. 
VIOLA It is to be expected on a Sunday. 
WESSEX And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house. 
VIOLA (cannot take this in) Mourning? Who is dead, my lord? 
WESSEX Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing. 
VIOLA almost faints. The NURSE steadies her. 
VIOLA (faintly) He is dead? 
WESSEX (cheerfully solemn) Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul 
VIOLA gives a silent cry. The NURSE is speaking to her in distress. 
NURSE My ladymy ladynow is the time to show your breeding. 
INT. CHURCH. DAY. 
The NURSE is holding VIOLA up as they enter the church. VIOLA seems catatonic. The NURSE lowers her onto a seat and sits down next to her. 
As they sit, the CHOIR enters singing. WESSEX, who is sitting in the next pew, looks about him with interest. He hasn't been in a church for years. What he sees turns him to jelly. He sees WILL SHAKESPEARE. 
ANGLE on WILL. 
WILL is a spectral, bedraggled figure, backlit by a great shaft of light, he would look like a ghost at the best of times, and this is the worst. Bleeding from where he has banged his head, bedraggled and ravaged by the night, he stands in a side chapel staring at WESSEX. 
WESSEX gasps and sweats, and sees WILL raise a quivering accusatory finger at him. WESSEX cracks. He starts to mumble. 
WESSEX Oh, spare me, dear ghost, spare me for the love of Christ! 
Now VIOLA sees WILL. She is still paralysed, and seems at first unable to take him in. She watches with detachment as WESSEX starts to back out of the church, finally running in terror. 
WESSEX (CONT'D) (screaming) Spare me! 
The CHOIR continues to sing, but the scream brings VIOLA to her senses and she runs to a side door where WILL is leaving. 
EXT. CHURCH. DAY. 
Outside, VIOLA sees WILL, staggering away from the church. She calls his name. 
VIOLA Will! 
He does not answer. She runs after him. 
VIOLA (CONT'D) Oh, my love, I thought you were dead! 
She claps him to her. They told each other for a moment then WILL pulls back. 
WILL and VIOLA. VIOLA dressed as THOMAS. He has present for her--a neatly written manuscript of his play, on sheets folded to octavo size. 
WILL The play. All written out for you. I had the clerk at Bridewell do it, he has a good fist for lettering. 
She wants to accept the present with joy, but something in his mood restrains her. 
WILL (CONT'D) There's a new scene 
He turns the pages and shows her. 
VIOLA Will you read it for me? 
WILL (he knows it) "Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale." 
VIOLA (reading) "It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die." 
The words of the scene become WILL'S and VIOLA'S, their way of saying the farewells they cannot utter. 
WILL "Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer" 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY. 
But the scene is continuing with VIOLA dressed as "THOMAS." Somewhere behind and up above the stage, in a deserted corner among rigging, bits of scenery, etc., they speak the lines and we hardly know ourselves whether it is rehearsal or lovemaking. But after a few moments it is definitely lovemaking. Their clothes start coming away, their words interrupted by kisses. 
WILL "thou need'st not to be gone." 
VIOLA "I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day." 
By now, her loosened bosom-bandage has been pulled away and WILL passionately embraces her nakedness. 
And into this heaving composition comes a little white mouse, unseen my them, climbing through a knot hole in the planking behind VIOLA'S head. 
An adjacent knot hole reveals a human eye and we do not need to be told it is JOHN WEBSTER'S. 
WEBSTER takes his eye away from the peephole, and frowns, thinking it out. 
EXT. ALLEWAY. DAY. 
TILNEY puts a coin in WEBSTER'S hand. 
TILNEY You will go far, I fear. 
TILNEY (CONT'D) I hope we work together again. Tilney walks away. 
EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY. 
A man is pacing up and down, in a sort of agony. He is muttering. He is glancing at a sheet of paper. He is FENNYMAN rehearsing the important role of the Apothecary, for which he has a special voice. 
FENNYMAN "Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's law Is death to any he that utters them." Then him. Then me. 
"Put this in any liquid thing you will And"--something 
He has dried up. He curses--the terror and despair. 
FENNYMAN (CONT'D) "Such mortal drugs I have" What is it? What is it? 
He is so wrapped up in all this that he simply does not notice when WESSEX rides up to the main entrance dismounts and walks inside. 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY. 
Onstage, the rehearsal continues. WESSEX strides in. Among the audience are HENSLOWE, a few actorsand JOHN WEBSTERwho sees WESSEX and jumps up and goes to him. 
WEBSTER My lord! 
WESSEX knocks him aside and continues. 
WESSEX (shouts) Shakespeare! 
Everything stops. 
WESSEX (CONT'D) You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell! 
WILL You are on my ground. 
WESSEX (drawing his sword) By God, I'll fight the lot of you 
WILL draws his sword. 
WILL I am more than enough. 
VIOLA reacts. She almost gives herself away. But the fight has started. 
HENSLOWE (in despair) It is over. 
VIOLA I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor. (she turns to WILL) I am sorry, Will. 
WILL shakes his head. This cannot be the end. VIOLA walks away, leaving by the public entrance. They all let her go, watching her silently. As she passes WABASH 
WABASH Y-y-y-you w-w-w-were w-w-w-w- wonderful. 
VIOLA Thank you. 
As she is leaving, WILL comes to life. He starts off towards herbut his progress is halted by a sock to the jaw from NED ALLEYN. WILL falls down in the dust. FENNYMAN enters, still bent over his sheet of paper, mumbling his precious lines. When he reaches the groundlings yard, he finds to his surprise the whole COMPANY is standing about in attitudes of despair or worse. FENNYMAN looks around. 
FENNYMAN Everything all right? 
EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. EVENING. 
The closure notice is nailed to the door. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
VIOLA, in her nightdress, is reading by candlelight. She is reading her private manuscript of Romeo and Julietand rereading. Next to her is a tray of covered dishes. the NURSE enters and looks at her sympathetically. She lifts the tray. She realises it is heavy. She puts it down and raises the covers and sees that VIOLA has eaten nothing. 
She looks at VIOLA'S tears, but there is nothing to be said. 
INT. TAVERN. DAY. 
They are all there--the ADMIRAL'S MEN, including WILL and HENSLOWE, drowning their sorrows. Everyone is drunk. FENNYMAN is also there, taking the disaster somewhat selfishly. 
FENNYMAN (muttering) I would have been goodI would have been great. 
He hands a flask to RALPH who is in a similar mood. 
RALPH So would I. We both would. 
RALPH contemplates the flask, and, since he's not working, takes a swig. A moment later, he keels over, rigid as a pole. The street door crashes open. BURBAGE enters. Behind him enter a solid wedge of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN, sober-faced, several with black eyes and bandages round their heads. 
FENNYMAN (shouts) Lambert! 
LAMBERT, FENNYMAN'S henchman and killer, puts down his tankard and comes forward, casually kicking chairs and tables out of his way. 
FENNYMAN (CONT'D) Kill him! 
LAMBERT reaches up to the wall over the bar and takes down once of the ceremonial weapons hanging there--a battle-axe. 
But BURBAGE has flintlock pistol stuck into his sash. BURBAGE draws and the pistol roars, shooting flame, LAMBERT curses, drops the axe, nurses his wounded hand. BURBAGE puts the pistol back into his sash. NED ALLEYN is half-drunk at a table. He staggers to his feet. He faces BURBAGE. 
ALLEYN Well, Burbage--you never did know when your scene was over. 
BURBAGE That can wait. The Master of the Revels despises us for vagrants, tinkers, and peddlers of bombast. But my father, James Burbage, had the first licence to make a company of players from Her Majesty, and he drew from poets the literature of the age. Their fame will be our fame. So let them all know, we are men of parts. We are a brotherhood, and we will be a profession. Will Shakespeare has a play. I have a theatre. The Curtain is yours. 
EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY. 
A strong wind is blowing through the trees. A BOY with a paste-pot and a bundle of flyers, is having trouble pasting a flyer on the wall of the building. A gust of wind scatters the bundle and sends a couple of dozen flyers flying into the sky. The BOY with the paste-pot runs around, trying to recover those he can. We look at the poster. It says 
BY PERMISSION OF MR. BURBAGE A HUGH FENNYMAN PRODUCTION OF MR. HENSLOWE'S PRESENTATION OF THE ADMIRAL'S MEN IN PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCELLENT AND LAMENTABLE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET with Mr. Fennyman as the Apothecary 
WILL comes out of the theatre, and passes the poster. He walks on without looking at it. A voice calls after him: 
HENSLOWE Will! 
WILL does not turn to look at him. 
HENSLOWE (CONT'D) We'll be needing a Romeo 
WILL carries on walking. 
EXT. STREETS. DAY. 
WILL is pushing through the crowds on his way to the river. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAY. 
The NURSE is helping VIOLA to dress--in a wedding dress. The NURSE is in tears. VIOLA submits to the task impassively. 
EXT. THE RIVER. DAY. 
WILL is climbing down the ladder to the waiting boats. 
INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. HALL. DAY. 
WESSEX, dressed to be a bridegroom is concluding his negotiations with DE LESSEPS, while LADY DE LESSEPS weeps. DE LESSEPS is signing papers. There is a money chest, too. 
INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY. 
Everything is ready. NED signals the musicians. Trumpets and drums sound. The house falls silent. 
INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY. 
WABASH seems to be important at the beginning. We have never been told what part he plays. He is still muttering lines and stuttering them. 
WABASH (mutter) T-t-t-two h-h-households b-both alike in d-d-d-dignity. 
WILL listens to him in agony. He finds HENSLOWE next to him. 
WILL (to HENSLOWE) We are lost. 
HENSLOWE No, it will turn out well. 
WILL How will it? 
HENSLOWE I don't know, it's a mystery. 
And off we go. HENSLOWE claps WABASH on the shoulder and sends him through the curtain. 
ANGLE on WABASH 
INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. 
The audience waits expectantly. WABASH gathers himself. 
WABASH AS THE CHORUS T-t-t-t-two 
INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY. 
WILL shuts his eyes and prays. 
INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY. 
WABASH launches himself into a perfect audacious delivery like a star. 
WABASH AS THE CHORUS "Household both alike in dignity (in fair Verona where we lay our scene) From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star- cross'd lovers take their life, Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents' strife" 
EXT. STREET. DAY. 
VIOLA and the NURSE, hurrying toward the Curtain. 
INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY. 
HEMMINGS BROTHERS are ready to go on as "SAMPSON" and "GROCERY," Act I Scene I. They shake hands. Beyond the curtain, the audience applauds the Prologue as WABASH comes through the curtain backstage. 
WILL (to WABASH) Wonderful! 
WABASH W-w-w-was it g-g-g-good? 
The HEMMINGS BROTHERS enter the arena and the play begins. 
POV: from THE WINGS: 
JOHN HEMMINGS AS SAMPSON "Gregory, on my word we'll not carry coals." 
JAMES HEMMINGS AS GREGORY "No, for then we should be colliers." WILL looks as if he would rather be dead. SAM GOSSE approaches WILL, nervously. 
SAM (nervously--in a deep bass guttural hoarse voice) Master Shakespeare 
WILL (absently) Luck be with you, Sam. (as the awful truth gets through to him) Sam? 
SAM (in the same voice) It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday. 
WILL Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line. 
SAM (the effect is horrible) "Parting is such sweet sorrow" 
HENSLOWE has been overhearing. 
HENSLOWE Another little problem. 
WILL What do we do now? 
HENSLOWE The show must  you know 
WILL Go on. 
HENSLOWE Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right. 
HENSLOWE and BURBAGE look at each other. 
BURBAGE We will all be put in the clink. 
HENSLOWE (shrugs) See you in jail. 
INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY. 
FENNYMAN, oblivious to the drama, is practising his lines in a fever of nervousness. 
FENNYMAN "Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's Law Is death to any he that utters them." Then him. Then me. 
INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. 
Swordplay. An amazing performance that holds the audience spellbound. "TYBALT" kills "MERCUTIO." 
ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO (to ROMEO) "I am hurt. 
WILL AS ROMEO Courage man. The hurt cannot be much. 
ALLEYN A MERCUTIO Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man." 
A roll of thunder. Over the heads of the audience, far above the thatched roof of the theatre, clouds are gathering in the sky. On stage "MERCUTIO" is in 'ROMEO'S" arms, but the tone of the playing is unlike anything we have seen before: without bombast, intense and real. And the audience is quiet and attentive. 
ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO (CONT'D) "--Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your arms." 
EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY. 
In the semirural view towards the City of London, there can be discerned a gaggle of approaching MEN and three is something orderly about them. As they come closer, we see that they are a company of PIKE MEN, marching toward the theatre, led by the Master of the Revels, TILNEY. Thunder rolls. 
INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. 
Figures are running across the stage, in the panic that follows "TYBALT" death. 
ACTOR AS BENVOLIO "Romeo, away, be gone! The citizens are up and Tybalt slain. Stand not amazed. The prince will doom thee death If thou art taken. Hence, be gone away!" 
WILL AS ROMEO "I am fortune's fool!" 
ACTOR AS BENVOLIO "Why dost thou stay!" 
INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY. 
WILL has just 'killed' "TYBALT." He is still breathless from fighting. he stands face to face with VIOLA. 
WILL I am fortune's fool. 
They stare at each other, transfixed. 
WILL (CONT'D) You are married? 
PAUSE. She cannot answer. 
WILL (CONT'D) If you be married, my gave is like to be my wedding bed. The implication of her silence fills the air. WILL does not move. 
INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. 
We cannot tell whether this is the play or their life. The audience, and the rest of the world, might as well not exist. WILL turn from her and begins to descend from the 'balcony.' 
VIOLA AS JULIET "Art thou gone so? 
WILL stops. 
VIOLA AS JULIET (CONT'D) Love, lord, ay husband, friend, I must hear from thee every day in the hour, For in a minute there are many days. O, by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo" 
WILL as "ROMEO" seems unable to speak. Then he says: 
WILL AS ROMEO "Farewell" 
All other sounds drain away, and time seems to stop. 
VIOLA AS JULIET "O think'st thou we shall ever meet again? Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, As one dead in the bottom of a tomb. Either my eyesight fails, or thou lookest pale." 
WILL AS ROMEO "Trust me, love, in my eyes so do you. Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu. Adieu" 
INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. 
Now the FRIAR is giving "JULIET' his potion. 
EDWARD AS FRIAR "No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death Thou shall continue two and forty hours And then awake as from a pleasant sleep" 
INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. 
HIGH ANGLE on audience and stage. "THE PRINCE" played by WABASH is having the last word. 
THE PRINCE "For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo." 
The end. There is complete silence. The ACTORS are worried. But then the audience goes mad with applause. 
INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE INNER CURTAIN/STAGE. DAY. 
The inner curtain opens, but WILL and VIOLA, are in a play of their ownembracing and kissing passionately, making their own farewell. HENSLOWE is too stunned and moved to react at first. Then he looks at the audience and the penny drops. It's a hit. 
INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM/STAGE. DAY. 
The audience roars. WILL, VIOLA, and THE COMPANY come forward to meet the applause. TILNEY and his MEN burst in. TILNEY jumps up onto the stage, where the ADMIRAL'S MEN are taking their bows. TILNEY'S "COPS" ring the stage, facing inwards. 
TILNEY (shouts triumphantly) I arrest you in the name of Queen Elizabeth! 
The AUDIENCE goes quiet. BURBAGE jumps out of the audience onto the stage. 
BURBAGE Arrest who, Mr. Tilney? 
TILNEY Everybody! The Admiral's Men, The Chamberlain's Men and everyone of you ne'er-do-wells who stands in contempt of the authority invested in me by her Majesty. 
BURBAGE Contempt? You closed the Rose--I have not opened it. 
TILNEY is at a loss but only for a moment. 
TILNEY (he points a "j'accuse" finger at VIOLA) That woman is a woman! 
The entire audience and the actors, recoil and gasp. The NURSE crosses herself. 
ALLEYN What?! A woman?! You mean that goat?! 
He points at VIOLA, brazening it out without much chance. 
TILNEY I'll see you all in the clink! In the same of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth 
And an authoritative voice from the audience interrupts him. 
VOICE Mr. Tilney! 
It is QUEEN ELIZABETH herself, descending now, her hood and cloak thrown back. She is an awesome sight. A shaft of sunlight hits her. 
QUEEN Have a care with my name, you will wear it out. 
There is a general parting of the waves, soldiers and actors, a general backing off and bowing as QUEEN ELIZABETH takes the limelight. 
QUEEN (CONT'D) The Queen of England does not attend exhibitions of public lewdness so something is out of joint. Come here, Master Kent. Let me look at you. 
VIOLA comes forward, and is about to curtsey when she catches the QUEEN'S eye, an arresting eye, which arrests the curtsey and turns it into a sweeping bow. 
QUEEN (CONT'D) Yes, the illusion is remarkable and your error, Mr. Tilney, easily forgiven, but I know something of a woman in a man's profession, yes, by God, I do know about that. That is enough from you, Maser Kent. If only Lord Wessex were here. 
VOICE He is, Ma'am. 
The voice belongs to JOHN WEBSTER. He points firmly at a figure in the audience, WESSEX, trying to look inconspicuous. 
WESSEX (weakly) Your Majesty 
QUEEN There was a wager, I rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today. (turning to WEBSTER) You are an eager boy. Did you like the play? 
WEBSTER I liked it when she stabbed herself, your Majesty. 
The QUEEN fixes WILL with a beady eye. 
QUEEN Master Shakespeare. Next time to you come to Greenwich, Come as yourself and we will speak some more. WILL bows deeply. The QUEEN turns to leave. The waves part for her. 
INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. MAIN ENTRANCE. DAY. 
The QUEEN is bowed out through the doors. 
EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY. 
A gaggle of the QUEEN'S favoured courtiers wait by her carriage. WESSEX is hurrying down the exterior staircase as the QUEEN emerges from the theatre. During the following a general egress from the Auditorium is taking place, including some of the actors crowding to see her off. WESSEX bows out of breath. 
WESSEX Your Majesty! 
QUEEN Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon? 
WESSEX Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end? 
VIOLA has come out of the theatre, amongst some of the other players. The QUEEN catches her eye.

SHOOTING DRAFT 
FADE IN: 
NEON SIGN - THE PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT 
The N and the E are not working. So it reads the PR IC motel. ROOMS TO RENT BY DAY, WEEK, MONTH. KITCHENETTES. The Prince Motel has passed its prime. A few beat up cars are parked outside rooms. We CRANE DOWN to ROOM SEVEN. Curtains closed, but someone is holding it open a crack, looking out. We PUSH in CLOSE TO THE WINDOW and the EYE looking over the parking lot. Then the curtain closes. 
INT. ROOM SEVEN - PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT 
Peeling flowered wallpaper, ultra-cheap furniture. The man moving away from the window is RODRIGUEZ. He is slender, sports a thin mustache, hair slicked straight back. He's in his late thirties. Slightly nervous. 
Another man sits on the couch, looking at a magazine. He is forty, solidly built. His name is FRANK DIVINCI. 
DIVINCI Says here they got slips in Honolulu. 325 a month. Utilities included. That's not bad. 
Rodriguez sits down. 
DIVINCI But I gotta get at least a forty footer. It'll handle rough water better and I'll need the room if I'm gonna live on it. 
Rodriguez stands up, moves back to the window. Divinci looks up. 
RODRIGUEZ I don't know how you do it. 
DIVINCI What? 
RODRIGUEZ How you can think about Hawaii now? 
DIVINCI My heart's in Hawaii. 
RODRIGUEZ You never been there. How can your heart be there. 
DIVINCI You're tellin' me there's no place you'd rather be other than here? 
RODRIGUEZ No, I'm saying I just don't know how you can think about Hawaii right now. 
DIVINCI If I was in Hawaii right now, I wouldn't be thinking about here. See the difference? 
RODRIGUEZ No. 
DIVINCI Look, I'm not in Hawaii, I'm here. But I don't want to be here, I want to be in Hawaii. I can't be in Hawaii, therefore I think about it so as to not get depressed about being here. 
RODRIGUEZ But I'm here, I know I'm here, I don't like being here, but I can't be anyplace else because I look around and I see all this shit. How do you get around that?! That's what I'm asking. 
DIVINCI Focus. 
RODRIGUEZ Focus. 
Divinci nods. Rodriguez looks at his watch. 
RODRIGUEZ It's time. No more Hawaii, okay? Focus on this. 
DIVINCI (smiles) Aloha. 
Rodriguez shakes his head, exasperated, and exits. 
RODRIGUEZ (to himself) Aloha my ass. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT 
Poor side of town. A few old cars parked on the street. Some buildings vacant. A LATE MODEL WHITE CADILLAC cruises past. We HEAR LOUD RAP MUSIC. 
INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT 
LIONEL HUDD drives. Hudd is thirty. African American. The MUSIC is loud. His clothes lean to African roots. A WOMAN sits next to the passenger window. Her name is CYNTHIA WEBB. Cynthia is thirty-five, dressed in short provocative skirt, tight top. A little too much make-up. She's lead a hard life. 
She glances at Hudd. Hudd glances at her, looks down at her skirt hiked up on her leg. 
CYNTHIA Left at the corner. 
Hudd's eyes linger on her thighs for a moment, then he turns his attention back to driving, tapping along with the heavy bass. 
EXT. PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT 
The Cadillac pulls into the parking lot. Parks in front of room SEVEN. Hudd gets out, looks around. Cynthia gets out, leads him to SEVEN. Knocks. 
The curtains pull back. Divinci looks at Hudd and Cynthia. She nods to him. The door unlocks and opens. 
Cynthia enters. Hudd looks around again. Then follows. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM SEVEN - NIGHT 
Divinci waits at the door. He and Hudd eye each other as Hudd enters the room. Divinci looks out, making sure no one has followed, then shuts the door. 
DIVINCI Hope you don't mind me checkin' you for weapons. 
HUDD Hell yes I mind. 
Rodriguez and Divinci are silent. 
CUT TO: 
DOOR - INT. APARTMENT - DAY 
KICKED IN on a grungy small apartment. Divinci and Rodriguez burst in, guns drawn. Scaring the shit out of an HISPANIC MAN (CORTEZ) and his half-naked GIRLFRIEND as they watch television. 
DIVINCI AND RODRIGUEZ NOBODY MOVE! HANDS IN THE AIR! NOW! MOVE IT! 
CUT BACK TO: 
THE .44 - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 
SLIDING across the table back to Rodriguez and Divinci. Cortez sits across from them. Wearing white t-shirt, baggy pants. Tattoos on his arms. 
CORTEZ Ain't my gun. 
RODRIGUEZ (smiles) Got your prints on it. 
CORTEZ (stands; angry) You fuck, I ain't never seen that gun before! 
RODRIGUEZ Where were you last Friday night? 
CORTEZ Fuck you. I wanna talk to a lawyer! 
Just want they wanted to hear. No alibi. 
RODRIGUEZ Lawyer's not gonna help you, Cortez. All the evidence we got points right to you. 
Cortez stares at them for a moment, then -- 
CORTEZ Did you say last Friday night? 
Cortez smiles and pulls up his shirt, revealing a long scar across his stomach. 
CORTEZ Intensive Care, you pindejo fuckin' gutter shits. And Thursday night, and Saturday, too. I just fucking got out this morning. 
CUT TO: 
MAN - EXT. ALLEY - DAY 
SLAMMING INTO A WALL, hitting hard, falling back to the dirty garbage covered alley. He's about twenty-seven, thin, blond hair tied in a pony tail. He wears a flannel shirt, jeans, boots. He doesn't want to fight. His name is DAVE. 
DAVE Alright, alright, alright... shit. I ain't gonna fight you. 
He looks up at Divinci and Rodriguez moving toward him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 
Dave is behind the desk handling the .44 with no apparent problem. 
DAVE Ain't my gun. 
RODRIGUEZ That's what they all say. 
DAVE Wish it was. No better gun than Smitty and Wes .44 mag with serial numbers filed off. (opens cylinder) Got any bullets? 
Divinci walks around, holds out his hand for the gun. 
DAVE Who did I kill? 
DIVINCI Where were you last Friday night? 
DAVE You mean, what's my alibi right? 
Dave spits on the gun, wipes off his prints with his shirt. 
DAVE I was breakin' and entering. Jewelry store on seventh and Front, about nine o'clock. Not even close to your jurisdiction. I got the rocks to prove it. 
He drops the gun, clean of prints onto the table. 
DAVE Sorry I can't help ya. But one to five is better than ten to life. 
Divinci and Rodriguez stare at Dave. They are not happy. 
CUT TO: 
MUG SHOTS - INT. HOMICIDE SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
in plastic pages. A BINDER full of criminal portraits. Divinci is going through one book. Rodriguez searches another. 
DIVINCI Montrose LaJolla... 
RODRIGUEZ We pulled him in last year for knifing that dealer on 32nd. 
DIVINCI Yeah. Almost killed him, remember? He'd be good. (calls out to ANOTHER DETECTIVE) Anybody seen Montrose LaJolla? 
ANOTHER DETECTIVE He's dead. His life partner killed him in a Domestic D about a month ago. 
Rodriguez suddenly slams his book shut. 
RODRIGUEZ Shit! 
Divinci slams his foot down on the accelerator and -- 
THE CAR 
-- tears off down the street. 
CUT TO: 
RODRIGUEZ - INT. BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 
asleep. Alone in a double bed. The PHONE RINGS. Rodriguez startles awake. Catches the phone on the second ring. 
RODRIGUEZ Who the hell is this? 
INTERCUT WITH DIVINCI - INT. MOTEL ROOM - EARLY MORNING 
Divinci on the phone in the f.g. Joe is passed out on the bed in the b.g. The room is dark. 
DIVINCI Is that any way to answer the phone? 
RODRIGUEZ Divinci, shit! It's quarter to six. 
DIVINCI I know what time it is, I'm not the one in bed. I need the photos of the scene. 
RODRIGUEZ Now? 
DIVINCI I got a suspect. But he can't remember all the details. He needs a little help. And I thought, since you're my partner, you might jump at the opportunity to lend me a fuckin' hand. 
Rodriguez sits up in bed. 
RODRIGUEZ He doesn't remember last Friday? 
DIVINCI He doesn't remember a lotta Fridays. Bring the shots and pick up a fifth of Vodka. (glances at Joe) Make it two. 
CUT TO: 
JOE - INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY 
asleep on the bed. 
DIVINCI Time to get up, Joe. 
Divinci slaps him. Joe's eyes open. 
DIVINCI I want you to look at something. 
The room is still dark. Curtains drawn. We now see Rodriguez. He's wearing a black sock cap and gloves. He hands Divinci POLICE PHOTOGRAPHS of the car, the street, the victim -- the murder scene. Divinci pulls Joe into a sitting position. 
DIVINCI There's the guy and the street and the car. You remember how you shot him. 
Joe stares at the photographs and starts to shake his head. 
DIVINCI You don't remember? That's not what you told me last night. 
Joe is confused. 
DIVINCI If you remember you can have a drink. 
Joe looks at the bottle Rodriguez holds out to him. 
DIVINCI But you gotta remember how you saw him driving toward you and you were in the street and you were afraid he was going to hit you so you had to shoot to protect yourself. You remember now don't you? 
Joe stares at the photographs for a moment, then nods. 
DIVINCI And where's your gun, Joe, where do you keep your gun? 
Joe thinks a moment, then reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out the .44. Divinci hands Joe the bottle and Joe drinks. We PUSH IN on the BOTTLE OF VODKA as the liquid drains away and we CLOSE IN TIGHT until we can SEE LIONEL HUDD'S FACE as we -- 
DISSOLVE TO: 
CLOSE UP - THE PHOTOGRAPHS 
Hudd dead. Blood on the windows. The street. Joe is drunk again. In a haze. Starts to lift the bottle. Rodriguez pulls it away. Rodriguez and Divinci always stay behind Joe. 
RODRIGUEZ Why'd you kill him? 
WILLIAM I... don't know... 
RODRIGUEZ It was your gun. 
WILLIAM ...I don't have a gun. 
DIVINCI Yes you do. In your pocket. 
WILLIAM ...I'm tired. 
DIVINCI I know, Joe, it's tough to remember things you don't wanna remember. What about your last name, Joe. You got a last name? 
Joe looks up as if trying to remember. Or trying not to. 
RODRIGUEZ Come on, Joe, everybody's got a last name. 
WILLIAM I don't remember. 
RODRIGUEZ Don't fuck with us, Joe. We're trying to help you. What's your last goddamn name? 
held by Joe's hand, which is held by Divinci's gloved hand. Divinci has held Joe's finger on the trigger and pulled it. 
The gunshot is deadened in the old building. Joe is lying in the back seat of a car, passed out, with Divinci holding the .44 in his hand. The back door is open. The engine is running. 
DIVINCI Helluva nice shot, Joe. 
Divinci pulls the 44. out of Joe's hand, then shuts the door, gets into the front. The car pulls away, exiting the warehouse. 
HAND - INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY 
signing a name at the bottom of a paper -- Joe. Beneath it is the type written name: JOE DOE. We PULL BACK and see it's Joe signing a typewritten page as Divinci and Rodriguez watch. Joe is a mess. When he finishes he pushes the paper away and puts his head down on the table. Divinci picks up the paper and we -- 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
A small yellow Toyota with a bashed up left fender pulls to the curb. Cynthia gets out lugging her purse and a bag of groceries. We HEAR ANOTHER CAR DOOR SHUT. She turns. Divinci is walking across the street from his car toward her. 
CYNTHIA It's the middle of the day. 
Divinci gives her a look as he takes the grocery bag from her. 
DIVINCI Just talk. 
CYNTHIA Since when? 
Divinci leads the way into the apartment building. 
INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Cynthia opens the door, pulls the key out of the lock as Divinci enters behind her with the groceries. 
DIVINCI I need you to do something. 
CYNTHIA Good, I need the money. 
She shuts the door. Divinci deposits the bag on the table. Cynthia picks it up, moves into the kitchen. 
DIVINCI This isn't a deal. Where you goin'? 
CYNTHIA I got perishables, okay? 
Cynthia enters the kitchen and Divinci follows. Cynthia starts unloading the groceries, putting the milk, eggs, etc. into the refrigerator. 
DIVINCI The guy we did the last deal with is dead. 
Cynthia turns suddenly. 
CYNTHIA What? 
DIVINCI Somebody popped him that night, probably when he tried to unload the stuff. I don't know. 
CYNTHIA Jesus, does anybody -- 
DIVINCI -- Don't worry, there's no connection. We got the guy who did it. 
Cynthia breathes a sigh of relief. 
CYNTHIA You scared the hell outa me. 
DIVINCI We just need you to do one thing. 
CYNTHIA ...What? 
CUT TO: 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
Divinci and Rodriguez are moving down a hallway with Cynthia. She's nervous. Wants very much not to be here. 
DIVINCI He'll be third from the left. Don't fuck up. Third from the left. 
CYNTHIA What'm I supposed to say? 
DIVINCI Just look at 'em and then look at the man the third from the left and say, It's him. 
RODRIGUEZ And I'll say, Are you sure? 
DIVINCI And you say, Absolutely. No question. 
CYNTHIA This is all I need to do right? 
DIVINCI We have a signed confession. You i.d. him, he's goin' straight into the can. 
CYNTHIA Okay, okay. But this is it. I'm not doin' anything more than this. 
DIVINCI Hey, it's a done deal. 
CUT TO: 
INT. POLICE LINEUP ROOM - DAY 
ROWS of seats face a small platform. The LINEUP WALL is striped with horizontal lines with HEIGHT NUMBERS. The brightly lighted lineup is separated from the gallery, which is in the dark. 
UNIFORMED GUARDS are on hand to make sure there is no discussion, verbal or otherwise, between accused and witness. SIX MEN file onto the platform. All shady characters. 
CYNTHIA He didn't do it. 
DIVINCI How the hell d'you know that? Were you with him at the time?! You have a good goddamn alibi for him?! 
RODRIGUEZ Maybe she was blowing him! 
CYNTHIA Better him than you. 
Rodriguez grabs her arm and pushes her against the wall. Divinci looks around quickly to see who's watching. 
DIVINCI Take it easy. 
Rodriguez angrily throws up his hands and glares at Divinci. 
RODRIGUEZ Fine, I got nothin' at stake here. 
Divinci gives him a look, then leans right up next to Cynthia. 
DIVINCI This is what they call an open and shut case. He did the kill and he's going down. Don't make the mistake of thinking you know the right thing to do. 
Divinci holds out the paper. Cynthia hesitates a beat, then takes it and signs her name. 
CUT TO: 
JOE - CLOSE SHOT - MUG SHOTS 
holding a number. The SCENE FADES WHITE with the FLASH. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
CELL DOOR - INT. JAIL - DAY 
closing on Joe who is standing in the small CELL, facing the wall, his back to us. The door is locked and we -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY 
as the .44 is placed on a shelf. But this time it's tagged with a different number. M5114000. 
CUT TO: 
THE SIGNED CONFESSION - INT. CAPT. HENDERSON'S OFFICE - DAY 
as Agent Simms reads through it to the end. 
SIMMS Doe? 
Simms looks across at Rodriguez and Divinci. Capt. Henderson and TWO OTHER DEA AGENTS (HOOPER and SARKASIAN) are also present. The DEA are in suits and ties. 
RODRIGUEZ He wouldn't give us his last name. 
SIMMS He signed a confession but he wouldn't give you his last name? 
DIVINCI He said he couldn't remember it. (points to his head) He's a head case. 
AGENT HOOPER You run prints? 
RODRIGUEZ No priors. 
AGENT SARKASIAN Ballistics match? 
RODRIGUEZ We're waiting. But a forty-four was used in commission. He had a forty- four on him. 
AGENT HOOPER It went down pretty quick. 
DIVINCI It's our street. 
CAPT. HENDERSON I think they did a helluva job. 
Suddenly Simms slams his hand down on the desk. 
SIMMS Goddammit! 
Everyone turns to Simms. He's angry. Rodriguez is uneasy. 
SIMMS Some goddamn piece a shit blows him away for NOTHING! 
The intensity of Simms anger quiets everybody. A beat as Simms regains his composure. 
SIMMS I'm sorry. Hudd was too good for this to happen... I just didn't think he'd go down this way. 
Simms crosses the room to Divinci and Rodriguez. 
SIMMS Good work. Thanks. 
He shakes their hands. Then exits. Hooper and Sarkasian follow their boss out the door. Rodriguez, Divinci and Henderson exchange a look. 
CAPT. HENDERSON Do me a favor. Make sure this one sticks. I don't want the D.E.Assholes back in here. 
CUT TO: 
HEADLIGHTS (B&W) 
coming right at us. Closer and closer. Filling the screen. 
JUDGE WEINBERG The defense may now proceed. 
John Oblinger stands to present his side of the case. But our attention stays with Helen as she approaches the table to find her team in an upset. Their conversation is a tense whisper. 
RICHARD STEIN -- Jesus Christ! 
YOUNG MAN -- I don't know where? 
RICHARD STEIN Are you sure? 
YOUNG MAN They looked all over -- 
HELEN What's wrong? 
RICHARD STEIN They can't find the murder weapon. 
HELEN What're you talking about? 
RICHARD STEIN Dunner's .44. They can't find the goddamn gun! 
YOUNG MAN They lost it or something. Misplaced it, I don't know. They can't find it anywhere. 
HELEN (no whisper this time) What?! 
A pause in the court. The judge taps his gavel in anger as we -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Rodriguez, Divinci, Richard Stein, the young man and Helen. Helen is furious. 
HELEN -- I don't have a goddamn case without the goddamn gun. His fingerprints, the ballistics, everything! I have to have the fucking gun or he's gonna walk. That murdering piece of filth will go free without the .44. How could they lose it?! 
Rodriguez and Divinci exchange a look. 
CUT TO: 
RODRIGUEZ AND DIVINCI - EXT. COURTROOM - DAY 
walking quickly down the steps. 
RODRIGUEZ The Dunner gun, you used the fucking Dunner gun?! 
DIVINCI This is not my fuck up! Our shooting was supposed to be gang-related and unsolved! Only because we tagged a goddamn undercover cop do we need the fucking .44 for evidence! Otherwise, we never woulda needed it. So don't point your finger at me! 
RODRIGUEZ Alright, alright... But how are we supposed to explain how the same gun was used in two murder cases by two different killers when it was supposed to be in police custody?! 
DIVINCI We don't explain it. It's not our fault they lost the evidence. Ballistics are already complete in Dunner's case. All we need is another gun. 
CUT TO: 
BRIEFCASE - ALLEY - DAY 
as it opens, revealing a DOZEN different HANDGUNS. 
THE GUN SELLER All my merchandise is in top condition. Untraceable. The best money can buy. 
A BLACK MAN in a three piece suit, picks up the .44 with a GLOVED HAND. His accent is British. 
THE GUN SELLER It's got good knock down, but it's slow. Unless you have a preference for revolvers, I suggest a nine millimeter auto. They are more expensive, but what they cost in money, they save in time. 
Rodriguez and Divinci look down at the gun. 
DIVINCI The .44. 
The gun seller eyes them for a moment. 
RODRIGUEZ What? 
THE GUN SELLER You look like police. 
Divinci and Rodriguez stare at the gun seller. Then he smiles. 
THE GUN SELLER No offense. 
CUT TO: 
INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY 
as the NEW .44 goes onto the shelf. CASE NUMBER C-549087. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY 
Elliot is waiting, sitting at a table, staring at papers in his open briefcase. Door opens and a GUARD leads Joe into the room. Joe looks better, for the first time. His hair is combed. And he's clean. He wears jail blues. But he is a little gaunt. And tired. Elliot stands. The guard shuts the door, leaving them alone. 
ELLIOT Joe, I'm Elliot, we met the other... well, you weren't in very good shape. You look much better. 
Joe just stares at Elliot. 
ELLIOT Have a chair. We need to talk. 
WILLIAM About what I did. 
HELEN And we would like to enter it into court records. It was the same Smith and Wesson revolver he used to viciously murder George and Carol Beaman. 
The .44 is duly entered into the records. 
CLYDE 
glances at "his" .44 as it passes into the BAILIFF'S HANDS. It's a .44 all right. 
HELEN The prosecution would like to call Mr. Steven J. Allen to the stand. 
BAILIFF Steven J. Allen. 
STEVEN J. ALLEN, a short balding bespectacled man in his fifties, crosses to the witness box where he is sworn in, then sits. 
HELEN Mr. Allen, would tell the court what you do. 
STEVEN J. ALLEN I am a lab technician for the police department. One of my duties is to examine weapons used in violent crimes. 
Clyde's attention is on Helen's LEGS. He's bored by the proceedings, but something suddenly strikes him. He looks at -- 
THE .44 SMITH AND WESSON 
-- on the evidence table. There is no BLACK STAIN on the handle. 
STEVEN J. ALLEN I tested the defendant's revolver and matched the bullets fired to the bullets removed from the deceased. 
CLYDE That ain't my gun. 
All attention turns to Clyde. His attorney, the judge, the jury, Helen, everybody is surprised by the sudden statement. 
JUDGE WEINBERG I must remind the defendant that he is not to speak out when -- 
CLYDE That ain't my gun! 
The Judge taps her gavel. John Oblinger puts a hand on Clyde's arm. Clyde pulls it away. And now things happen very fast. 
CLYDE THAT AIN'T MY FUCKIN' GUN! 
And Clyde is moving toward the gun. And the Bailiff and GUARDS are moving toward Clyde. And Helen is moving out of the way. And the Judge is standing, banging her gavel. And the jury is scared. 
CLYDE YOU'RE TRYIN' TO FUCKIN' FRAME ME! 
Clyde grabs for the gun as the bailiff and guards grab for Clyde. Clyde turns and decks the bailiff and all hell breaks lose. 
CLYDE IT AIN'T MY FUCKIN' GUN! 
CUT TO: 
INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY 
Door slams open. Rodriguez and Divinci enter. Rodriguez quickly checks all the stalls as Divinci closes the door. They are alone. When Rodriguez finishes with the stalls -- 
RODRIGUEZ We gotta put the right gun back. 
DIVINCI We can't put the right gun back! Without that gun, they won't convict Joe. 
RODRIGUEZ Without that gun they won't convict Clyde! 
DIVINCI I'm not worried about Clyde, I'm worried about us! 
RODRIGUEZ Look, Joe's never goin' to trial, right. He signed a goddamn confession! Like you said, this one is open and shut. Clyde's the one we gotta worry about. We can't let him go back on the street! He's a fuckin' psychopath. He'll kill somebody again. 
DIVINCI Shit. How the hell did that piece of puke know it wasn't his fuckin' gun?! I don't think he knows his own fuckin' mother, but he knows his fuckin' gun! 
RODRIGUEZ I don't think that's important right now. 
CUT TO: 
INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY 
The harried Desk Officer is filling out his usual paper work when Divinci and Rodriguez approach. Divinci knocks on the door. The desk officer looks up. He's had a tough day. 
DESK OFFICER Sorry, Divinci, can't do it. 
DIVINCI What d'you mean you can't do it? I gotta check something. 
DESK OFFICER You gotta get written permission from the Chief. 
RODRIGUEZ Since when?! 
DESK OFFICER Since an hour ago when he came down here and chewed me a new asshole bigger than a three car garage. 
DIVINCI What's the problem? 
DESK OFFICER Something about missing evidence or who the hell knows. I just wanna transfer the hell outa here. 
DIVINCI What the hell're we supposed to do?! 
DESK OFFICER Ask the chief. Policy ain't my department! 
CUT TO: 
INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY 
Joe's preliminary trial. Joe is seated at the defense table with Elliot. ANOTHER JUDGE, JUDGE HAROLD PINE, is behind the bench. No jury. This is a preliminary hearing to determine if there's enough evidence for Joe to stand trail. Elliot is shuffling papers in preparation for his opening. 
RODRIGUEZ Do you think we're corrupt? 
DIVINCI Hey, I never took a fuckin' bribe in my life. 
RODRIGUEZ Me either. 
DIVINCI Nobody ever bought me. 
RODRIGUEZ I know. 
DIVINCI No fuckin' way. Even the thought makes me sick. And what we did has nothing to do with being corrupt. It's two completely different things. Don't get 'em confused. 
RODRIGUEZ I guess you're right. 
DIVINCI I'm telling you. It's nothin' to do with corrupt. 
RODRIGUEZ I'm worried, that's all. 
DIVINCI Hey, you gotta worry a little. It's natural. Just don't lose your sense of humor. 
RODRIGUEZ My sense of humor, right. 
DIVINCI The problem with people is, nobody gives a shit about makin' the world a better place. You and me, I don't care what anybody says, we made the world a better place. No matter what happens. There are ten less drug dealin' assholes on the street today because of us. They're not plea bargainin' their way back onto the street, they're not clogging up the courts, and they're not costing the tax payers a fuckin' penny because they're not in prison. They were garbage. And there's nothin' wrong with takin' out the garbage. 
Divinci downs his scotch. Rodriguez nods, then -- 
RODRIGUEZ So, you think you'll get back with Caroline? 
DIVINCI Shit. Nothin' I ever do is good enough, you know? 
RODRIGUEZ Never is, never was, never will be. 
DIVINCI Guess I gotta make the effort. It's gonna cost me if I don't. 
RODRIGUEZ Tell me about it. You know how much I got left. 
DIVINCI You're gonna think I'm an idiot, but... I like Cynthia. There's no bullshit with her. I just fuckin' like her. 
RODRIGUEZ I think you just like fuckin' her. 
Rodriguez smiles. Divinci looks at him for a beat, then -- 
DIVINCI Yeah, that, too. 
CUT TO: 
NEWSPAPER - INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - DAY 
with JOE'S PHOTOGRAPH on the front page. HEADLINE: UNDERCOVER COP GUNNED DOWN BY UNDERCOVER KILLER. We PAN AROUND to Cynthia, sitting in her kitchen, staring at the photograph. 
CYNTHIA What the hell, Joe, at least you won't get run over. 
She folds up the paper and throws it in the trash can. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY 
The Dunner trial. The JURY is back. Helen, Judge Weinberg, Clyde D. Dunner (who now sports a couple bandages to his head), his attorney John Oblinger -- they're all waiting for the verdict. 
JUDGE WEINBERG The defendant will stand and face the jury. 
Clyde stands. 
JUDGE What is your verdict? 
JURY FOREMAN We find the defendant, Clyde David Dunner, not guilty. 
Helen closes her eyes in defeat. Clyde smiles. 
CLYDE Fuckin' A! 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOMICIDE DIVISION - DAY 
Divinci is on the phone. 
DIVINCI -- when was the last time you saw him? -- Uh-huh -- And you haven't seen him since then? 
Rodriguez suddenly strides up. He looks panicked. 
RODRIGUEZ We gotta talk. 
DIVINCI (into phone) Just a second. (covers phone) Calm down. I heard. Clyde walked. 
RODRIGUEZ No! (leans in close) They're takin' Joe to trial. 
Divinci stares at Rodriguez for a beat, the reality of his statement taking a moment to fully slam home. 
RODRIGUEZ They found him mentally unable to plead so his attorney pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. 
DIVINCI You gotta be kiddin' me. 
RODRIGUEZ Yeah, that's me, I love to make people laugh. You hear the one about the two cops who popped the undercover DEA? 
He takes her arm, leads her out of the station. 
INT. POLICE STATION PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT 
Divinci leads Cynthia out of the station to his car. 
CYNTHIA I thought you said all I had to do was pick him out?! That's what you said, that's all I had to do. I did what you said. But that was supposed to be all. 
DIVINCI SHUT UP! 
He opens the driver's door, pushes her in. Gets in behind her. 
INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT 
Cynthia is a bundle of nerves. Divinci slams the door. Cynthia is startled by the suddenness of his anger. 
DIVINCI What're you talkin' about? 
Cynthia opens her purse and pulls out the subpoena. 
CYNTHIA They want me in court. 
Divinci glances at the papers. 
CYNTHIA You promised me I wasn't gonna have to do anything! What the hell is goin' on?! 
This is yet another glitch that Divinci hadn't counted on. 
CYNTHIA I can't do this, Frank. I can't go into court. I'm gettin' outa here! 
DIVINCI You are not getting outa here! 
CYNTHIA Well I can't go to court! THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID I'D HAVE TO DO! 
DIVINCI WELL THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN! NOW JUST FUCKIN' CALM DOWN FOR A SECOND AND LET ME THINK! 
Cynthia glares at him, then turns away, takes a drag and blows out the smoke. 
CYNTHIA Fine. Think away. 
Divinci hesitates as ANOTHER CAR pulls out. Then turns to her. 
DIVINCI Look, you're a witness, that's all. You got nothin' to worry about. You saw something happen -- 
CYNTHIA -- What?! What did I see?! 
DIVINCI I will tell you everything you gotta know. You understand? Everything. You will know exactly what to say. 
Cynthia looks at Divinci, unsure. Divinci gives her a confident smile. Look, it's another stage, that's all. Just like dancin'. 
THE UNMARKED CAR 
pulls quickly out of the PARKING GARAGE.

INT. JAIL - MEETING ROOM - DAY 
Elliot is waiting. The guard opens the door and Joe enters. Joe is looking better. Getting him off booze has helped immensely. 
ELLIOT Hi, Joe. You're looking much better. 
WILLIAM I guess jail's been good for me. 
Elliot nods, motions for Joe to take a chair. 
ELLIOT Trial date's been set for Thursday. 
WILLIAM I've been thinking about what I did... and I don't think it's right that I try getting off. 
ELLIOT Excuse me? 
WILLIAM I want to plead guilty. I killed a man and I should be punished. 
ELLIOT ...I'm a little surprised. 
WILLIAM Why? 
ELLIOT Nobody ever wants to be punished for what they've done. It's just a new concept. But I still think our defense is reasonable. I don't believe, under the condition you were in, that you were responsible for your actions. 
WILLIAM But why was I carrying a gun? I had no right to carry a gun. 
ELLIOT If you hadn't been carrying the gun, you might be dead. 
WILLIAM And he might be alive. 
ELLIOT I understand... Can I think about this? 
WILLIAM No. I've made up my mind. 
Elliot stares at Joe for a beat, then we --

A BUTLER shows Arthur to the patio where another MAN, NATHAN MCCALL, is seated behind a table, reviewing documents. McCall is fifty-five, wears glasses. 
BUTLER Mr. Baylor is here. 
McCall looks up, smiles. 
WILLIAM Arthur. 
Arthur crosses. The two men shake hands. 
ARTHUR Nathan. How are you? 
WILLIAM Good, Arthur, thanks. Would you like some coffee, juice. 
ARTHUR No, I'm fine. 
WILLIAM Well, this is all a bit of a mystery. You certainly got my attention with your phone call. What's this all about? 
Arthur removes a NEWSPAPER from his briefcase. Opens it. Revealing the PHOTOGRAPH OF JOE and the headline: UNDERCOVER COP GUNNED DOWN BY UNDERCOVER KILLER. McCall looks at the paper. 
WILLIAM Is there something you want me to see? 
Arthur points at the photograph. McCall looks. A beat, then -- 
WILLIAM Oh my God.

We HEAR a key in the lock. The door opens and Divinci enters. He looks around. 
DIVINCI Cynthia. 
He moves into the bedroom. Sees clothes strewn around and a half empty closet. 
DIVINCI Shit! 
He heads back into the living room. Pulls open the door and almost runs into Richard Stein who was just about to knock. 
DIVINCI (startled) Jesus! 
Richard Stein is just as startled and it takes him a moment to recognize -- 
RICHARD STEIN Divinci? 
Divinci is caught off guard. 
RICHARD STEIN Richard Stein, D.A.'s office. 
DIVINCI Oh, yeah, sorry. I didn't expect -- what're you doing here? 
RICHARD STEIN I have to talk with Cynthia Webb. A witness in -- well, wait, aren't you and Detective Rodriguez on this one? 
DIVINCI (vamping) Yeah, yeah, that's why I'm here. I wanted to go over some of the details. 
RICHARD STEIN Me, too. Is she there? 
DIVINCI No. 
RICHARD STEIN I was supposed to meet her at two. (looks at watch) Do you know her? 
DIVINCI What d'you mean? 
RICHARD STEIN Well, I just mean, if she's not here... you were... (a little awkward) ...inside. 
DIVINCI (forces a smile) Oh, yeah, the legal thing. Well, she's a witness in a murder case. And when they don't answer a knock and the door's open, it's my experience, you know. I like to make sure there's no dead bodies layin' around. (pulls door shut) Don't tell on me. 
RICHARD STEIN No, no, of course not... Well, maybe I should wait. She might be stuck in traffic or something. 
DIVINCI Yeah. If she shows up, let me know. I'd like to talk to her, too. 
RICHARD STEIN Of course. 
Divinci looks at Stein for a beat, then smiles and -- 
DIVINCI See you in court. 
RICHARD STEIN Right. 
Divinci heads down the walkway. Richard Stein watches him for a moment, then looks at the closed door, then at his watch. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ELLIOT'S OFFICE - DAY 
Elliot's office is a cramped space in the PUBLIC DEFENDERS FLOOR of the CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING. A buzz of activity outside. The staff is overworked, underpaid and underappreciated. Elliot is reviewing legal documents. Knock on the door. 
ELLIOT Yeah. 
MANNY How long I got? 
DIVINCI Two days. 
MANNY Shit, two fuckin' days! 
DIVINCI Find her, puss head. 
Divinci glares at Manny, then exits. Manny watches him leave. 
MANNY Sure, Detective. Always like to help out the police whenever possible! 
CUT TO: 
INT. LARGE COURTROOM - DAY 
Joe (William) is lead into the courtroom by GUARDS. Takes his place at the DEFENSE TABLE which includes Elliot and TWO YOUNG ATTORNEYS. The PROSECUTION TABLE, which includes Richard Stein and Helen is going over last minute minutia. 
PEOPLE are taking seats in the gallery. But another attorney joins the Defense table. It's Arthur Baylor. And Richard Stein double-takes when he sees him. 
AT THE PROSECUTION TABLE 
RICHARD STEIN (to Helen) Isn't that Arthur Baylor? 
Helen turns. 
HELEN Yes. 
They watch Arthur shake hands with everyone - Elliot, the two young attorneys and Joe. 
RICHARD STEIN What's he doing here? 
Arthur takes a seat at the defense table and glances across at Helen and Richard and nods. Helen and Richard are stunned. 
HELEN What the hell? 
BAILIFF Hear ye, hear ye. All rise, face our flag and recognize the principles for which it stands. The Criminal Court, Department G is now in session. The Honorable Harold W. Pine presiding. 
Everyone rises as JUDGE HAROLD PINE enters. In black robe. Taking his place behind the bench. He sits.

Everyone sits. And even Judge Harold Pine double-takes when he sees Arthur Baylor at the Defense table. 
BAILIFF The People versus Joe Doe in case number 95-24705. 
JUDGE HAROLD PINE Before we proceed, I'd like to ask the Defense if there's anything this court should be made aware of. 
Arthur stands. 
ARTHUR Yes, your honor. I have joined the defense in the representation of Mr. William Dane McCall, otherwise known to this court as Joe Doe. 
Everyone turns to look at Joe (William McCall). CAMERA PUSHES in on him. It doesn't look as if he's sure who he is yet. 
ARTHUR I have represented the McCall family for several years before William McCall's disappearance seven years ago. It was assumed that he had died, but since he has reappeared under these tragic circumstances, I would ask this court for a continuance to allow the defense to prepare adequately in light of his real identity now being known. 
JUDGE HAROLD PINE How long do you need. 
ARTHUR One week should be sufficient. 
JUDGE HAROLD PINE Any objection to a week's continuance by the State? 
HELEN I don't... believe so, your honor. 
JUDGE HAROLD PINE Then I grant a one week continuance. We will start the proceedings next Monday morning. 
Judge Harold Pine taps his gavel.

FLASH Joe's photograph and scenes of him being lead from the courtroom. Helen and Richard Stein are watching. They can't believe it. 
NEWSCASTER -- when it was discovered that the man who has confessed to killing an undercover DEA agent, was actually himself thought dead for seven years. The man who signed the confession as Joe Doe is actually William Dane McCall, brother of Nathan McCall. Both are sons of the founder of McCall International, a corporation involved in telecommunications, computer design and development and other related industries. The net worth of both men is estimated at over a billion dollars --

INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY 
Parked on the street. Rodriguez and Divinci inside. Rodriguez reads the paper. 
RODRIGUEZ -- but William McCall shunned the business world and turned his life to medicine, receiving his medical degree from Harvard in 1969. Once again he turned his back on the established norm and spent several years in Africa performing organ transplants for the poor. 
Rodriguez slams down the paper. 
RODRIGUEZ Jesus Christ, this is who you picked? A goddamn surgeon who performs organ transplants on poor Africans?! 
DIVINCI He was living in the fuckin' street! How the hell was I supposed to know he was a goddamn doctor?! 
RODRIGUEZ He's not a goddamn doctor! You picked a fuckin' Saint to pin a fuckin' murder on! 
Divinci grabs the paper away from him. Both cops are angry, upset, frustrated and scared to death. 
RODRIGUEZ When we pick 'em, we really fuckin' pick 'em. We shoulda just picked up the fuckin' Pope. 
DUNCAN I got one piece of advise. When you break for lunch, don't get the pastrami. 
We HEAR the BARRED CELL DOOR open. 
GUARD Time to go. 
Joe gets up. Puts out his hands. They shackle him as we HEAR --

INT. LARGE COURTROOM - DAY 
Joe is sitting at the Defense table with Arthur and Elliot. The trial is underway. And they watch the .44 go to the evidence table -- the .44 with the BLACK STAIN. 
Richard Stein is seated at the Defense table. He, too, is watching the .44. He leans across to his ASSISTANT. 
RICHARD STEIN All these goddamn guns are startin' to look the same to me. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
DIVINCI - INT. LARGE COURTROOM - LATER 
on the stand, being questioned by Helen. 
HELEN And when you arrested the defendant, did he deny that he had killed Agent Hudd. 
DIVINCI No. 
HELEN Can you describe the defendant's condition at the time of his arrest. 
DIVINCI He was drunk. We could smell the booze on him. But we drew blood. He didn't object. 
HELEN We have the blood test report that shows -- (picks up report) -- that he had four times the legal limit to drive. The people would like to enter this into evidence. 
They so enter it. 
CUT TO: 
RODRIGUEZ - INT. LARGE COURTROOM - LATER 
on the stand. Elliot is cross-examining. 
ELLIOT -- and you arrested the defendant four days after the killing. What lead you to suspect Mr. McCall? 
RODRIGUEZ You ask questions. Work the neighborhood. Find out who was on the street that night. 
ELLIOT Yes, but specifically Mr. McCall? He had no previous criminal record. 
RODRIGUEZ We found someone who'd seen him in the area. So we picked him up for questioning. We didn't expect it to be him. But if someone saw him in the area that night we would want to talk to him. If he wasn't the killer, he might've seen the killer. Just routine really. 
ELLIOT Where did you find the defendant? 
RODRIGUEZ On the street. Corner of Third and Madison. 
ELLIOT What was he doing? 
RODRIGUEZ He was passed out. 
ELLIOT But you knew it was the man you were looking for. 
RODRIGUEZ Yes. 
ELLIOT Based on what? 
RODRIGUEZ His description. 
ELLIOT Who provided you with the description? 
RODRIGUEZ (hesitates a beat) Cynthia something, I think. 
Elliot moves to the defense table, glances at Arthur as he picks up a paper. Arthur nods approvingly. Elliot looks at the paper. 
ELLIOT I believe her name is Cynthia Webb. According to the statement filed the night she picked him out of the line- up. The name familiar? 
BAILIFF You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God. 
She turns her eyes from Joe. 
CYNTHIA Sure. 
BAILIFF You may be seated. 
Cynthia sits down. Looks at Divinci. 
And Joe leans across to Arthur and Elliot. Their conversation is in whispers -- 
WILLIAM I know her. 
ELLIOT She's the woman who identified you. 
WILLIAM No. I mean I know her. 
ARTHUR ...How? 
WILLIAM I'm not sure... I think I lived near her. 
Arthur exchanges a look with Elliot. Arthur turns now and looks at Cynthia. The wheels are turning. 
HELEN Please state your name for the court. 
CYNTHIA Cynthia Webb. 
HELEN Do you see the man that you identified in a police line-up in this room. 
CYNTHIA Yes. 
HELEN Is it the defendant, Mr. McCall? 
Cynthia looks at Joe. Joe looks straight at her. Cynthia turns her eyes away. 
CYNTHIA Yes. 
HELEN Please describe what you saw the night of September 14th. 
CYNTHIA I was comin' out of an all night minimart -- 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET - MINI MART - NIGHT 
Cynthia comes out of a ALL NIGHT MINI-MART with a bag of food. She walks down the street and suddenly we HEAR a GUNSHOT. Followed by a CAR CRASH. She turns toward the sound. And we HEAR RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. Then we see a man running. He has a pistol in one hand. 
Cynthia watches the man run past and disappear into the darkness. 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. LARGE COURTROOM - DAY 
Cynthia is looking at Helen. 
HELEN And you're positive the man you saw with the gun is the defendant. 
Instead of looking at Joe, Cynthia turns to Rodriguez and Divinci who are seated in the rows behind the prosecution table. They are looking right at her. They wait for her answer. 
CYNTHIA Yeah. 
HELEN No further questions. 
Divinci offers her a small smile. 
Cynthia turns away. Arthur is now standing in front of her. 
ARTHUR Miss Webb... is it Miss? 
CYNTHIA Yes. 
ARTHUR Miss Webb, had you ever seen the defendant before that night, the night you described to us? 
CYNTHIA No. 
ARTHUR Do you know what perjury is? 
CYNTHIA When you lie. 
ARTHUR When you lie under oath in a court of law. Do you know what the penalty for that is? 
CYNTHIA You go to jail. 
ARTHUR Yes... Cynthia, have you ever seen the defendant before that night? 
HELEN Objection. The witness has already answered that question. 
JUDGE HAROLD PINE Sustained. 
ARTHUR I just want to give the witness the opportunity to remember if she could have seen Mr. McCall anyplace else before the night in question. 
Divinci stares at Cynthia. As if willing her to give the answer he wants her to give. 
JUDGE HAROLD PINE Ms. Webb, do you understand the consequences of perjury? 
ARTHUR When you went home you saw Joe? 
Cynthia realizes what she's said. 
CYNTHIA No. 
HELEN Objection. Defense is trying to confuse the witness. 
ARTHUR I'm not trying to confuse the witness, it's the witness that's trying to confuse the court. I have witnesses who will refute her testimony. Witnesses who were on that corner the night of the shooting, who never saw Ms. Webb, who never heard the gunshot, who never saw Joe run past. Ms Webb saw Joe outside her apartment building that night because he lived in the alley next to it. Isn't that right, Ms Webb? 
Arthur turns dramatically to Cynthia. She is scared. 
HELEN Objection! 
Everyone's attention is on Cynthia. 
ARTHUR When I referred to him as Joe, you knew who I was talking about, didn't you. This case is the People versus Mr. William McCall. Not Joe. Joe has never been mentioned in this trial. How did you know who I was talking about, Ms. Webb? 
Cynthia looks from Arthur to Divinci. Divinci is frozen. Rodriguez is sweating. 
Then Cynthia turns and looks at Joe. 
Joe looks at her, feeling sorry for her. Not hating her. 
ARTHUR Ms. Webb, how did you know that Joe was the defendant? 
Cynthia lowers her eyes to the floor. 
CYNTHIA He lived in the alley next to my apartment building. 
Helen and Richard Stein are stunned yet again. 
HELEN (to herself) Oh shit. 
Divinci and Rodriguez are doing their best to remain cool, calm and collected. 
ARTHUR Why did you lie to this court? 
CYNTHIA I don't know. 
ARTHUR Are you afraid of somebody? 
CYNTHIA I don't know. 
ARTHUR Are you protecting somebody? 
CYNTHIA I don't know. 
JUDGE HAROLD PINE Answer the questions, Ms. Webb or I'll be forced to cite you for contempt. 
Cynthia looks up at the judge. She's not talking.

RODRIGUEZ We'll make it look gang related. 
DIVINCI Problem is we're gonna need another gun. 
RODRIGUEZ The problem?! Have you forgotten? She's in fucking jail. That's the goddamn problem. 
DIVINCI Since when is being in jail a guaranty of a long life? You just get a fuckin' gun.

MANNY Oh shit. I didn't do anything! 
DIVINCI Everything's fine, Manny. I just came to apologize. (looks at secretary) We need some privacy... 
Manny looks at Divinci, then motions for his Secretary to take a walk. She gets up, exits. 
INT. UNMARKED CAR - PARKED DOWN THE STREET - NIGHT 
Divinci and Rodriguez watch Cynthia get into the car with Manny. 
RODRIGUEZ This is the last time, Frank. The last time we kill somebody. 
DIVINCI Yeah, it's the last time. 
RODRIGUEZ This'll be eleven, Frank. Eleven is enough. 
DIVINCI I get the picture. 
Divinci looks at Rodriguez. He's staring out the window, but he looks ill. Something is not right with him. 
RODRIGUEZ It was all okay until you shot Hudd. 
DIVINCI What's goin' on here? You mad at me or something? 
RODRIGUEZ It wasn't my idea to start killing people, Frank. That's all I'm sayin'. We're in this goddamn mess because you started killing people. 
DIVINCI Drug dealers don't qualify as people. Never did, never will. So what the hell's wrong with you tonight? You suddenly worried about where all the money went? 
RODRIGUEZ I'm just sick of it, that's all. 
Divinci stares at Rodriguez for a beat, then starts car.

The unmarked car turns off the street onto the side street and stops. The lights go out.

Divinci exits. Rodriguez hesitates, then gets out with him. 
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
RODRIGUEZ Frank -- 
DIVINCI Talk to me, okay? Just fuckin' talk to me. 
Rodriguez hesitates a moment, then -- 
RODRIGUEZ I don't know... I owe some money. I don't know how I'm gonna pay it... 
DIVINCI You gambling again? 
RODRIGUEZ Yeah, yeah... I just couldn't... Frank... let's forget about this. Let's just get the fuck outa here. We got enough money, let's go. We'll get outa the country or something. 
Divinci turns toward Rodriguez. And he's got his pistol out. 
RODRIGUEZ What the hell're you doin'?! 
DIVINCI Take off your shirt. 
RODRIGUEZ What're you talkin' about? 
DIVINCI Just take off your shirt. If there's nothin' to worry about, then I'll apologize. But I'm not gonna argue. Take off your fuckin' shirt now. 
RODRIGUEZ What is this, you piece of shit?! You don't trust me?! Is that it?! YOU DON'T FUCKIN' TRUST ME AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH?! 
DIVINCI ...Take off your shirt. 
RODRIGUEZ Fuck you, you don't trust me. 
DIVINCI I'm askin' you one more time. 
RODRIGUEZ You wanna shoot me? Shoot me. 
Divinci hesitates. He doesn't want to. This is his partner. A beat, then he lowers his gun. 
DIVINCI Okay, I'm sorry. You're right. I'm fuckin' nervous. Like you. Forget it. This thing... shit. Let's just get it over with. 
Divinci holsters his gun. Rodriguez hesitates, breathes a sigh, then returns to the car. They both get back in. 
INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT 
Divinci starts up the car. 
DIVINCI I'll just feel a whole lot better when she's dead. Then we're off the hook. 
RODRIGUEZ Right. 
Divinci starts to shift gears, but suddenly throws his elbow into Rodriguez' face. And Divinci is all over him like a tornado. Slamming a fist into his face repeatedly. He grabs his shirt and rips it open REVEALING the TAPE RECORDER strapped to his body, recording their every word. 
DIVINCI YOU FUCKIN' RAT! 
Divinci puts his revolver to Rodriguez' head. Rodriguez, bleeding from the mouth and nose, looks at Frank. 
RODRIGUEZ Yeah... yeah... I am, I'm a fuckin' rat... I traded you, Frank, I fuckin' traded you... Simms knows everything. 
AGENT HOOPER It was Divinci wasn't it? 
CYNTHIA I don't know. 
SIMMS Which one pulled the trigger? Divinci or Rodriguez? 
CYNTHIA I don't know. 
Agent Simms looks right into Cynthia's eyes. 
SIMMS Detective Rodriguez is dead. He was shot in the head last night. 
This gets Cynthia's attention. 
SIMMS Rodriguez was wearing a recorder. Divinci found it. You can do addition, can't you. 
CYNTHIA You're full of shit. 
AGENT SARKASIAN Just tell us what you know. 
Cynthia looks at both of them. 
CYNTHIA Where's Divinci? 
SIMMS We don't know. But we're gonna find him. 
CYNTHIA You're gonna find him? (smiles sarcastically) Right... I don't know a fuckin' thing. 
Simms stares at her for a moment, then turns to Hooper and nods. Hooper takes Cynthia's arm and leads her out of the office. When the door closes -- 
SIMMS Get a copy of the tape to Bailor. But make sure it doesn't come from us. 
CUT TO: 
INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - DAY 
Cynthia is alone in her cell. We HEAR footsteps. She looks up as the GUARD approaches. 
GUARD Your attorney's here. 
CYNTHIA What attorney? 
INT. ROOM - COUNTY JAIL - DAY 
Cynthia enters the office. The Guard shuts the door. Cynthia finds herself facing Arthur Baylor. A tape recorder on the table in front of him. 
ARTHUR Hi, Cynthia. Please sit down. 
CYNTHIA I got nothin' to say. 
ARTHUR So I'm told. 
Arthur pushes the tape recorder and we HEAR -- 
DIVINCI'S VOICE ...Take off your shirt... 
RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE Fuck you, you don't trust me. 
DIVINCI'S VOICE I'm askin' you one more time. 
RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE You wanna shoot me? Shoot me. 
DIVINCI'S VOICE Okay, I'm sorry. You're right. I'm fuckin' nervous. Like you. Forget it. This thing... shit. Let's just get it over with. I'll just feel a whole lot better when she's dead. Then we're off the hook. 
Arthur watches Cynthia's reaction to "when she's dead." But Cynthia has seen enough not to be too shocked by anything. And her reaction is subtle. She knows better than to reveal what she's really feeling and thinking. 
RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE Right. 
DIVINCI'S VOICE YOU FUCKIN' RAT! 
RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE Yeah... yeah... I am, I'm a fuckin' rat... I traded you, Frank, I fuckin' traded you... Simms knows everything. Just fuckin' shoot me, get it the fuck over with! I DESERVE IT! I FUCKING DESERVE TO DIE! 
DIVINCI'S VOICE You're fuckin' right. 
The recording ends. Arthur shuts off the machine. 
ARTHUR I think you know my client is innocent. That's all I care about, my client. But I understand why you're scared. You're already facing perjury charges. My guess is, your involvement is deeper than that. But I don't really care, I'm not after you... I get nothing if you go to jail. But I think if I help you, I can help my client. 
CYNTHIA ...how? 
ARTHUR William -- Joe -- didn't do it, did he? 
Cynthia hesitates, then shakes her head. 
ARTHUR Why don't you sit down.

CUT TO: 
INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING) 
Door opens. Cynthia enters. Shuts the door. Tries the light. It doesn't go on. Suddenly a man is next to her -- 
MAN'S VOICE (DIVINCI) I guess you had no choice. 
Cynthia tries to move, but a hand grabs her arm. And now we see Divinci. He looks like hell. A man on the run. Desperate and dangerous. He hasn't shaved. His clothes are filthy. He looks like... Joe. Cynthia looks up at him. 
DIVINCI You had to do the right thing. 
CYNTHIA What d'you want? 
DIVINCI What do I want? 
Divinci suddenly shoves her hard across the room. 
DIVINCI Why're you asking me that? You gonna grant me three wishes? I don't know where to start. Let's see... money would be nice... love would be better... but a little loyalty... you can never get enough of that. (moves up to her) ...But we'll start with... money. 
Divinci pushes her into the bedroom. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING) 
Cynthia goes to her closet, pulls out a box, opens it. It's got her savings. 
CYNTHIA This is all I've got. 
Divinci grabs the money and stuffs it into his jacket pocket. 
CYNTHIA They'll catch you. 
DIVINCI I don't think so. 
CYNTHIA You wanna bet? 
DIVINCI They don't have a clue, baby. And you wanna know why? Because I am following my heart. 
Divinci puts aside his gun. And pushes Cynthia down on the bed. He leans in close to her. Face to face. 
DIVINCI And they don't know where that is. 
CYNTHIA So tell me about your plans. I think I'd like to hear 'em now. 
Divinci looks at Cynthia for a moment, almost with remorse. 
DIVINCI Loyalty is what it all comes down to. Nothing holds together when it's gone. And once it's gone, you don't ever get it back... You shouldn't've told 'em. 
CYNTHIA I shouldn't've done a lotta things in my life. But that's not one of 'em. 
DIVINCI Let me tell you something... the only difference between a liar and a witness is that just one of 'em knows what he's doing. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING) 
It is dark and quiet. No clue as to what's going on inside. And we hold on this for a long moment. Just wondering what's she being made to do. And then there's a MUFFLED BOOM. Divinci exits the bedroom quickly. He is upset. We HEAR the DOOR close. 
AND WHITE FEATHERS 
fall like snow flakes on Cynthia's body draped across the bed. The pillow on the floor beside her with the stuffing blown out. She has a hole in her chest, right above her heart. 
CUT TO:

Manny unlocks the door, enters his office. 
DIVINCI'S VOICE Shut the door and lock it.

MANNY You scared the shit outa me. 
DIVINCI Lock the door. 
Manny locks the door.

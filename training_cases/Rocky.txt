"ROCKY" 
by 
Sylvester Stallone 
RING PRODUCTIONS, INC. 
MASTER SCRIPT: INCLUDES ALL REVISIONS AS OF 1/7/76  REVISED: 
INT. BLUE DOOR FIGHT CLUB - NIGHT 
SUPERIMPOSE OVER ACTION... "NOVEMBER 12, 1975 - PHILADELPHIA" 
... The club itself resembles a large unemptied trash-can. The boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle. The lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is fighting. 
In the ring are two heavyweights, one white the other black. The white fighter is ROCKY BALBOA.  He is thirty years old. His face is scarred and thick around the nose... His black hair shines and hangs in his eyes.  Rocky fights in a plodding, machine-like style.  The BLACK FIGHTER dances and bangs combinations into Rocky's face with great accuracy. But the punches do not even cause Rocky to blink... He grins at his opponent and keeps grinding ahead. 
The people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for blood... They lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters. In the thick smoke they resemble spectres.  Everyone is hustling bets... The action is even heavier in the balcony. A housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet. 
The BELL RINGS and the fighters return to their corner... Somebody heaves a beer can into the ring. 
The Black Fighter spits something red in a bucket and sneers across the ring at Rocky. 
BLACK FIGHTER (to cornerman) ... I'm gonna bust his head wide open! 
In Rocky's corner he is being assisted by a shriveled, balding CORNERMAN, who is an employee of the club... He works on Rocky without any enthusiasm. 
CORNERMAN (lackluster) ... Ya waltzin' -- Give the suckers some action. 
ROCKY Hey -- 
CORNERMAN (overriding) Ya movin' like a bum -- Want some advice -- 
ROCKY ... Just gimme the water. 
A FIGHT FAN rushes up to Rocky... He is sixty-five, with yellow teeth and wearing sunglasses. 
FAN Should I bet the fight don't go the distance -- Ya feel strong? 
ROCKY Absolutely. 
CORNERMAN ... Ya want some good advice? 
ROCKY ... I just want the mouthpiece. 
The BELL RINGS... Rocky makes the sign of the cross.  The fighters engage in battle.  The other fighter grabs Rocky in a clinch and purposely butts him... The butt opens a bleeding cut on the corner of Rocky's eye. 
Rocky becomes furious over the foul and drives a flurry into the man's body... Rocky slams the man on the jaw and the fighter is out for the night.  The fans throw rubbish into the ring.  Rocky ignores it. 
The fans loudly go about collecting bets.  The referee does not bother to even count the fighter out and drags him under the ropes where he is placed on a stretcher.  Two new fighters enter the ring.  Rocky slips on a tattered robe. Embroidered clumsily on the back is, "The Italian Stallion." 
ANNOUNCER Winner, Rocky Balboa -- Next a six rounder between local lightweights. 
Without pomp Rocky climbs out of the ring and bums a cigarette from a spectator... The fighter on the stretcher passes behind him.  He watches for a moment and continues up the aisle... Before he even reaches the rear of the club the BELL RINGS and the next fight has already begun... Rocky fades into the darkness of the rear of the club. 
THE TITLE CREDITS END: 
INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
Rocky has nearly completed dressing and reaches into his locker for his hat... Also in the dingy room are ten other fighters... Two taped fighters talk shop in the corner. 
FIGHTER #1 ... Tomorrow me an' my woman are gonna tip on down to Atlantic City, man. 
FIGHTER #2 ... It's cold, Bro'. 
FIGHTER #1 ... That's right, I got the city to myself... 
Another paces nervously... Two other fighters shadowbox and spit nervously on the floor. 
A young pug combs his hair and listens to a portable RADIO that is BLASTING MUSIC. 
The fighter that Rocky has just defeated is drinking a beer and joking with three other fighters... Some of the fighters are smoking.  The room is cloudy. 
A short man of fifty enters.  He is dressed in a sweater buttoned over a t-shirt. 
PROMOTER ...Balboa!? 
FATS Please, I need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs. 
At wits' end the man picks up a large metal hook used by stevedores.  Rocky remains cool. 
ROCKY Goin' fishin'? 
The man drops the hook. 
ROCKY What's ya name again? 
FATS Bob. 
ROCKY Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band -- If ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man... Me, I ain't emotionally involved. 
Rocky's determined expression strikes home.  The fat man quickly fumbles through his pockets and hands over a small wad of bills. 
ROCKY (continuing; counting) A hundred an' thirty. 
FATS That's it, I'm broke. 
ROCKY That's it? -- Completely? 
FATS That's it. 
ROCKY What about for food an' stuff? 
FATS You have my food in ya hand. 
Rocky looks almost sympathetically into the fat man's flushed expression. 
ROCKY ... The juice is climbin' every week. 
FATS I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest. 
ROCKY Ya still light seventy. 
FATS Waits! -- Be smart.  Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars.  It's yours. 
The man quickly removes his coat and extends it... 
FATS (continuing) See, ya a smart guy, Gazzo's don't have to know nuthin'. I'll go tape up the hand like ya broke my thumb.  Gazzo won't be wise to nothin' -- Be a smart guy, keep the coat, we'll fake like ya broke the hand. 
The man extends his coat again... Rocky suddenly grabs the man's thumb and bends him to his knees. 
FATS (almost a whisper) No - no - no - Please - Please - Please don't... 
Rocky releases the man who remains almost in shock.  The thumb is fine. 
ROCKY ...That's what coulda happened. (walks off.) 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Later that morning Rocky passes "Animal Town Pet Shop" in South Philly... The shop is not very prosperous looking.  In the window hangs a sign reading "Today's special -- Mixed Kittens -- $1.50"... Rocky stops at this shop every morning. He stares at a litter of Lhasa Apsa puppies.  He taps the window and whistles.  He SEES a girl behind the counter and presses his face against the window and does his impression of the Hunchback of Notre Dame.  The girl nervously looks away. 
The girl behind the counter is ADRIAN KLEIN.  She is not very attractive, but pleasant-looking.  Thirty years old. Brown hair pulled back.  Light skinned.  She wears glasses. 
Rocky really stops by to flirt with Adrian, but she is so painfully shy nothing ever gets started... Rocky enters. 
INT. PET SHOP - DAY 
ADRIAN ... Could you take the puppy out -- 
CUSTOMER It can breathe. 
ADRIAN Please - 
CUSTOMER Please, nothin' - I paid for this dog and can do whatever I want with it - I can throw it through the window if I want - Now give me my two dollars back before I do throw it through the window. 
Rocky walks over to her, stares hard in her face and snatches the bag out of her hand.  He removes the puppy and hands it to Adrian. 
CUSTOMER Get away from me - Give me that! 
Rocky takes a couple dollars out of his pocket and hands it to the lady... She nervously exits. 
ROCKY ... How's the turtle food this week? 
ADRIAN ... Fine. 
ROCKY Me, I'm kinda aggravated. 
GAZZO It don't matter.  It's my reputation.  These guys think they can get off light.  It's bad for my reputation -- It's bad for business.  See ya killer. 
Gazzo gets into his car. 
GAZZO (to Bodyguard) ... The Rock's a good kid. 
BODYGUARD (emotionless) ... A meatbag. 
They pull away. 
EXT. GYM - DAY 
Gazzo drives off and Rocky strolls across the street to Goldmill's Gym.  On the way he passes several familiar people and exchanges waves... Out front is a young Irishman who runs a soft pretzel stand... His name is RUDY.  It is apparent from his face he was a prize fighter... He is blind and mentally defective. 
RUDY ...See the fight last night? 
RUDY Nah, I was fightin' myself. 
RUDY Apollo Creed beat the bum to pieces. 
EXT./INT. GYM - DAY 
Mickey's Gym is surrounded by bars and a couple of greasy spoons.  Out front a crowd of young Blacks talk and jive among themselves.  Two winos lean against the entrance. 
Rocky enters the gym... The place is nearly full.  The MEASURED BEAT of SKIP ROPES and THROBBING SPEED BAGS makes the room come alive, like it was a mindless piece of machinery.  Over the loudspeaker MUSIC by the Isley Brothers BLARES out... The music adds a background to the CLANG of the AUTOMATIC TIMERS, SNORTING SPARRING PARTNERS and the THUDDING of HEAVY BAGS. 
The room is divided -- Fifty percent Black -- thirty-five percent Latin -- ten percent white -- five percent other. 
As Rocky walks through the gym many of the FIGHTERS pause to wave and yell greetings. 
FIGHTER #1 Hey, hear ya knocked Spider Rice out in the sixth? 
ROCKY The third -- Shoulda seen it. 
Rocky passes another FIGHTER punching the heavy bag. 
FIGHTER #2 (removes glove) Hey, Rock, touch my hand. 
ROCKY How come? 
FIGHTER #2 C'mon, it's important. 
Rocky touches the Fighter's bare hand. 
FIGHTER #2 (continuing) Can ya tell I just whacked-off? 
Rocky smiles and moves away. 
INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY 
The dressing room is lined with dented lockers.  Wooden benches stretch across the room.  On the wall is a sign that reads, "NO KISSING." 
Rocky goes to his locker.  He tries to open it but fails. He leans his ear against the lock and rolls the tumblers. Still it does not open.  He shakes the lock forcefully, no luck... Rocky is flustered and sits on a bench to ponder the situation. 
After a moment of deep thought, Rocky stands, seizes the bench and smashes open the lock.  Opening the door Rocky is taken aback when he sees a set of very flashy clothes. 
ROCKY (mumbling) ... These ain't my clothes. 
He sees a picture of several black girls taped on the inside of the door. 
ROCKY (continuing) ... These ain't my pictures. 
A short powerful man of thirty-five enters.  His hair looks like it has been shaped with hedge clippers.  His name is MIKE. 
ROCKY Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here? 
MIKE It ain't your locker no more. 
ROCKY Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more? 
MIKE Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there. 
Rocky looks at his belongings crammed in a wilted shopping bag and follows Mike across the room... Mike leans his head into the shower room.  Two Latin fighters are lathering up. 
FIGHTER ...Hey, Peanut, gimme some soap, Man. 
MIKE (irate) Hey, Nobody -- Yeah, you, Nobody -- You don't call me Peanut. 
FIGHTER Peanut, gimme some soap. 
ROCKY You think everybody I fight is a bum. 
MICKEY Ain't they? 
Mickey shoots Rocky a quick, indifferent look and removes a rosary from his pocket and idly rolls it around his fingers. 
MICKEY (continuing) Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire. 
ROCKY Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it. 
MICKEY Hey, ever think about retirin'? 
ROCKY ...No. 
MICKEY Think about it. 
ROCKY Yeah, sure. 
Shrugging, Rocky moves away. 
ROCKY (continuing) ...I think I'm gonna take a steam -- Shoulda seen me fight -- Did good, y'know. 
Mickey leans over to Mike who approaches with a mop and pail. 
MICKEY (gesturing towards Rocky) Known him since he was fifteen -- A waste of life. 
Dejected, Rocky travels to the locker room.  He passes Big Dipper sparring in a ring... Dipper spits a mouthful of water in a bucket and looks smugly at Rocky. 
DIPPER (to Rocky) ... I dig yo' locker, Man. 
TRAINER Time, Dipper. 
Dipper smiles cruelly and begins sparring... Scene FADES on Rocky's crestfallen expression.  He moves off. 
EXT. PET SHOP - DUSK 
At sunset Rocky comes down the street and pauses at the pet shop... He is eating Colonel Sanders' fried chicken out of a bag... He taps on the window with a chicken bone. 
INT. PET SHOP - DUSK 
Inside Adrian is arranging pet toys on the counter... She hears the tapping, sees Rocky, and tenses.  Rocky enters. 
ROCKY ... Wow -- cold!  Good night to catch pneumonia. 
Adrian smiles slightly and moves behind the counter.  Rocky fumbles idly among the pet toys. 
ROCKY (continuing) Ah -- I came in here for somethin'... Oh, yeah, would ya like somebody to walk ya home? 
The girl wants to say yes but a tremendous inferiority complex will not permit it... Rocky understands. 
ROCKY (continuing) Hey, how's my buddy doin'? (looks into Butkus' cage) -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later. 
ADRIAN ... Goodnight, Rocky. 
Rocky exits.  Adrian watches his departure with mixed emotions. 
EXT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT 
A short while later Rocky arrives at Andy's Bar... He throws the Colonel Sanders bag and bones in a large public litter can.  The trash can has a bicentennial picture of George Washington pointing at a pile of garbage.  The caption reads, "There was no litter at Valley Forge!" 
INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT 
Rocky enters the bar.  He sits the Drunk in a booth... Several drinkers wave at him.  OLD ANDY sets a mug of beer in front of him... Rocky seems to be looking for someone. 
ROCKY Catch pneumonia out there -- Seen Paulie? 
Andy casually nods towards the men's room. 
Rocky traverses the room and passes TWO DRUNKS leaning on the bar. 
INT. ANDY'S RESTROOM - NIGHT 
Rocky enters the restroom... It is a vile stench hole with years of the remnants of many sick drunks caked on the wall. 
PAULIE is presently trying to comb his hair in the only remaining piece of mirror in the room... Paulie is in his early thirties.  He is medium height.  Brown hair.  Square shouldered.  He has a foul personality... A classic misanthrope. 
ROCKY Yo, Paulie. 
PAULIE (very drunk) Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror.  I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror. 
COMMENTATOR Still to be held in Philadelphia? 
APOLLO The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year. 
COMMENTATOR Where're you off to now? 
Apollo draws his wife close. 
APOLLO Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them. 
COMMENTATOR Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls? 
APOLLO (looks straight into the camera) ... Stay in school an' use your brains, dig -- Be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!!  Sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- Be a thinker not a stinker!! 
Apollo's entourage laughs and they move on... The Commentator faces the camera. 
COMMENTATOR Jerry Simpson at Kennedy Airport with the Champion, Apollo Creed. 
The sports show cuts away, but Rocky continues to look at the television with a pensive stare... Andy has been speaking the following dialogue over Apollo's broadcast. 
ANDY Nobody cares what's happenin' in the world of sports nomore -- Downhill.  Baseball, downhill -- Basketball, downhill.  Football's goin', too.  Bank on it.  Baseball use to be America's best sport... Sure -- Nuttin' like squattin' through a great double header, but now baseball's all business. 
The news report with Apollo ends.  Andy drinks. 
ANDY (continuing) Where are the real fighters? The pros.  Today we jig clowns. 
ROCKY Clown. 
ANDY Yeah. 
ROCKY He took his best shot an' became champ -- What shot did you ever take? 
ANDY Yo, Rock, you ain't happy with yourself?  Fine.  But me, I gotta business here -- I don't need to take no shot. 
Becoming despondent, Rocky rises and crosses to Paulie slumped unconscious in the booth. 
Rocky exits the bar... Andy turns to his customers. 
ANDY (continuing; boldly) Take a shot, he says! -- Sure, I'll take a shot! 
Laughing, Andy pours himself a shot. 
EXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - NIGHT 
Rocky passes an all-night sandwich shop... In the window hangs the sign "ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP, INC." Out front are several YOUNG MEN and WOMEN.  They are much too young to be out so late... A boy with a badly-chipped tooth beckons to Rocky. 
CHIPPED TOOTH (aggressively) Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man. 
ROCKY ... No wine -- Bad for ya' brain. 
CHIPPED TOOTH C'mon, man, it's cold, man. 
ROCKY No wine. 
CHIPPED TOOTH Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar. 
ROCKY Why? 
CHIPPED TOOTH (sarcastically) 'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar. 
ROCKY No dollar. 
CHIPPED TOOTH Hey, give Rocky a dime. 
YOUNG MAN #2 ... How come? 
CHIPPED TOOTH So he can call all his friends. 
ROCKY (mildly embarrassed) ... That's an old one. 
CHIPPED TOOTH Buy us some Thunderbird, man. 
Rocky ignores the statement and faces a very young girl who is smoking and leaning whore-like against the wall. 
ROCKY Is that Marie? -- Marie, ya brother know you're hangin' out so late? 
The girl, MARIE, assumes an indifferent attitude, attempting to impress her friends. 
MARIE ... Screw you. 
Marie nods. 
ROCKY (continuing) Listen, I hope ya don't -- 
MARIE I won't. 
ROCKY What was I gonna say? 
MARIE Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right? 
ROCKY Ya, somethin' like that. 
They exchange smiles and Marie moves away.  Rocky has made an impact on her life. 
MARIE Goodnight, Rocky. 
ROCKY 'Night, Marie. 
She takes a few more steps and pauses again. 
MARIE ... Fuck you, Creepo!!! 
The girl runs to her house as Rocky looks on in dismay. 
ROCKY (walks off) ... Yeah, who're you to give advice, Creepo. 
INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY 
APOLLO CREED and his LAWYER and TRAINER are seated in the offices of MILES JERGENS.  Jergens, a successful promoter looks unhappy as he looks into the scowling face of Apollo Creed. 
LAWYER Are the doctor's reports confirmed? 
JERGENS Definitely -- (reading) -- It says here, Mac Lee Green has suffered a seriously cracked third metacarpal in his left hand. 
APOLLO Damn. 
JERGENS I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green. 
TRAINER It ain't just Green, what about the time Apollo's invested -- 
JERGENS I believe we can find a solution. 
APOLLO Solution, nothin' -- What about the Bicentennial fight. 
LAWYER Jergens, don't play games with my client!  Apollo has already done nearly a million dollars worth of publicity -- 
TRAINER Ten million's worth! 
LAWYER -- And has made contractual obligations with over twenty different organizations -- He doesn't want to be embarrassed. 
APOLLO You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man! 
JERGENS (holding up some notes) I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week. 
APOLLO Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth. 
JERGENS Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth? 
LAWYER Hell with Fourth of July, man! Ten thousand things'll be goin' down on the Fourth of July! -- Apollo wants to be first! 
JERGENS That may not be possible, Jimmy. 
TRAINER This man here is the Star, dig -- Don't cause him to breathe heavy -- Now what 'bout that sucker, Billy Dukes? 
JERGENS Went to California and gained fifty pounds -- and I called every worthwhile contender, but they say five weeks isn't enough time to get in shape. 
Apollo stands beneath a new fight poster and points to it. 
APOLLO Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid.  They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!! 
JERGENS Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this. 
TRAINER Nobody wants to be dissected on the country's birthday. 
JERGENS All I can counter with is that I'm a goddamn good promoter -- I've promoted in every country in the world -- and I've tried to the best of my abilities. Perhaps you're right, and no one wants to be beat on the country's birthday... I don't know what else to say -- 
APOLLO I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty. 
TRAINER You's the novelty, Champ! 
ADRIAN It's Thanksgiving. 
ROCKY To you, to me it's Thursday. 
INT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT 
Rocky and Adrian enter a deserted skating rink. 
ROCKY Looks quiet, y'know. 
ADRIAN I think it's closed. 
ROCKY I think mebbe we're early or somethin' -- 
From across the rink a CLEANING MAN yells at them. 
CLEANER Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed! 
ROCKY (yells back) Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody. 
CLEANER (starts to walk over) Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here. 
ROCKY Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out. 
ADRIAN (softly) We could go somewhere else an' -- 
Rocky approaches the Cleaner. 
CLEANER Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'. 
ROCKY Listen, I gotta problem.  This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing -- 
CLEANER This a con? 
ROCKY Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise -- 
CLEANER Few minutes? 
ROCKY ... Ten minutes. 
CLEANER Ten minutes for ten dollars. 
ROCKY ... Yeah, give 'er the Blades. 
INT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT 
Adrian has on skates.  Rocky follows her onto the ice.  He wears street shoes. 
ADRIAN ... Aren't you skating? 
ROCKY Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles.  Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more.  All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro. 
ADRIAN And you never got the chance? 
The Cleaner yells from the sideline. 
CLEANER Nine minutes! 
ROCKY Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight.  Kinda do it like a hobby.  See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right? 
ADRIAN But you never had a chance to prove yourself. 
ROCKY Absolutely. 
CLEANER Eight minutes! 
Adrian slips and Rocky breaks her fall. 
ROCKY I just dislocated my finger. 
ADRIAN Ohh! 
CLEANER Seven minutes! 
ROCKY It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight. (opens his wallet) That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think? 
CLEANER Six! 
ROCKY How 'bout some Cokes? 
INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Rocky and Adrian enter his one-room apartment... She is nervous and taken aback by the bleakness of the room... Rocky goes to the icebox. 
ROCKY Would ya like a glass of water? 
ADRIAN ... No thanks. 
Adrian looks at the mirror above Rocky's dresser.  She sees a high school photo of Rocky.  He once was handsome and smooth-faced... Rocky steps up behind her and his face is reflected in the mirror. 
He turns on his cheap RECORD PLAYER... He reaches into the turtle bowl. 
ROCKY Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link. 
ADRIAN I sold them to you. 
ROCKY (very embarrassed) ... Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off. 
ADRIAN Do you have a phone? 
ROCKY I had it pulled.  People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call? 
ADRIAN I wanna let my brother know where I am. 
ROCKY D'you really wanna call? 
ADRIAN Yes, I do. 
ROCKY You sure? 
ADRIAN Yes. 
ROCKY Why? 
ADRIAN I think he might be worried. 
ROCKY I'll call your brother. 
Rocky flings open the window and bellows like a foghorn. 
ROCKY (continuing) !!Yo, Paulie -- Ya sister's with me!  I'll call ya later. 
Rocky closes the window and faces the woman... She is not smiling.  She looks frightened. 
ROCKY (continuing) What's the matter?  Ya don't like the room? 
ADRIAN It's fine. 
ROCKY It's only temporary. 
ADRIAN It's not that -- 
ROCKY What's the problem?  You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it? 
ADRIAN I don't think I belong here. 
ROCKY It's okay. 
ADRIAN No, I don't belong here. 
ROCKY It's all right -- You're my guest. 
ADRIAN ... I've never been in a man's apartment before. 
ROCKY (gesturing) They're all the same. 
ADRIAN I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable. 
ROCKY Yo, I'm not comfortable either. 
ADRIAN (standing) I should leave. 
ROCKY But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation. 
Adrian moves to the door... Rocky intercepts her. 
ROCKY (continuing; softly) Would ya take off your glasses? 
ADRIAN (dumbstruck) What? 
SECRETARY May I help you? 
Rocky hands her the business card. 
SECRETARY (continuing) Your name, please? 
ROCKY Balboa, Rocky Balboa. 
The Secretary rises and enters Jergens' office... Rocky eyes the multitude of sporting pictures hanging on all four walls. 
The Secretary returns. 
SECRETARY You may go in. 
Rocky collects himself and enters... 
INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY 
Miles Jergens warmly greets him. 
JERGENS Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat. 
ROCKY ... Thanks. 
JERGENS Mr. Balboa -- 
ROCKY (overriding) Rocky. 
JERGENS Rocky, do you have any representation?  A manager? 
ROCKY No -- Just me. 
JERGENS Rocky, would you be interested in -- 
ROCKY Sparrin'? 
JERGENS Excuse me. 
ROCKY I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available. 
JERGENS I'm sure you are. 
ROCKY Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what? 
JERGENS What? 
ROCKY I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner. 
Jergens seems very amused.  He lights a cigar. 
JERGENS Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship? 
ROCKY ... Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate. 
JERGENS Did you hear what I said? 
ROCKY Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ.  He's just there to help condition the man. 
JERGENS Not spar, I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship. 
The weight of the statement comes crashing down in Rocky. For a long moment he becomes nothing more than a basket case as he ponders the statement... He half regains his senses. 
ROCKY ... Ah... Absolutely. 
The SCENE FADES and becomes a black and white television. 
INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Rocky and Adrian are at her home watching an old black and white television... Rocky smiles... The film now cuts to Apollo being interviewed. 
REPORTER #1 How'd you like the 'City of Brotherly Love?' 
APOLLO I like my Philadelphia Brothers. An' I'm patriotic! 
Apollo has to move to the side to avoid a thrusting microphone. 
APOLLO (continuing; mock seriousness) If yo' don't back up I'm gonna send yo' home with a microphone in yo' nose! 
The Reporters laugh. 
ROCKY (uneasy) ... What? 
MICKEY (driving each word hard) I done it all.  I've done an' seen everything'.  Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press?  He did. He had a manager -- September 
ROCKY (softly) Ya got a good mind for dates. 
Mickey deafly continues, becoming more engrossed every second. 
MICKEY Look at this face -- twenty- one stitches over the left eye, thirty-four over the right -- my nose was busted seventeen times, the last being the Sailor Mike fight New Year's Eve, 1940, in Camden, New Jersey -- What a professional pastin' I give him.  Here, read about it. (MORE) 
MICKEY (CONT'D) (shows a tiny press clipping; points to cauliflower ear) An' he give me the vegetable on the ear.  I got pain an' experience... an' you got heart -- kinda remind me of Marciano, ya do. 
Rocky points to his most prized possession. 
ROCKY Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture. 
MICKEY Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock.  Ya move like 'im. 
Mickey has rung the bell.  Nothing could please Rocky more than being compared to his idol. 
ROCKY Really think so? 
MICKEY Ya got heart. 
ROCKY Heart, but I ain't got no Tocker. 
Rocky shifts against the wall and lowers himself into a crouch. 
MICKEY Christ, I know this business. Rocky, when I was fightin' it was the dirtiest racket goin', see.  Pugs like me was treated like fightin' dogs -- throw ya in the pit an' for ten bucks ya try to kill each other.  We had no management... (MORE) 
MICKEY (CONT'D) fought in boxcars, in whorehouse basements, any joint with a floor -- October 1931 I fought a bum who put a tack in the thumb of his glove an' punched so many holes in my face I had spit shootin' outta my cheeks -- I never had no manager watchin' out for me -- See that picture outside the gym -- 'Mighty Mick,' that's me in my prime.  I had all the tools.  I coulda starched any lightweight husky on the East Coast -- But I had no management.  Nobody ever got to know how slick I was, but I had a head for business an' stashed a few bucks an' opened the gym -- It's a dirt hole, I know it, but that an' a lotta scars is what I got to show for fifty years in the business, kid -- now you come along with this shot an' I feel like it's me gettin' the shot I never got... Yeah, we was treated like dogs -- like them Dago's, no offense, in the Colosseum in Rome there -- An' now I got all this knowledge, I wanna give it to ya so I can protect ya an' make sure ya get the best deal ya can! 
Rocky rises and opens a window. 
MICKEY (continuing) Respect, I always dished ya respect. 
ROCKY ... Ya gave Dipper my locker. 
MICKEY (almost begging) I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake.  Kid, I'm askin' man to man.  I wanna be ya manager. 
ROCKY The fight's set -- I don't need a manager. 
MICKEY Look, you can't buy what I know.  Ya can't.  I've seen it all!  I got pain an' I got experience. 
ROCKY I got pain an' experience too. 
MICKEY Please, kid. 
ROCKY (tightly) Whatever I got, I always got on the slide.  This shot's no different.  I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none. 
Mickey drops the ashtray and kneels to pick it up... He remains on one knee. 
MICKEY If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask?  Just ask. 
ROCKY I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance. 
MICKEY (yells) Rocky, I'm seventy-six years old.  Maybe you can be the winner I never was -- your shot is my last shot! 
Rocky is choked and goes into the bathroom and closes the door. 
Mickey struggles to his feet and, like a beaten man, leaves. 
Several moments later Rocky steps out and lowers himself into bed.  Springing up a second later, he runs outside. 
EXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Rocky races up the block toward the shadowy and hunched form of Mickey.  Way in the distance, we SEE Rocky stop the old man beneath a street lamp.  He places an arm around his shoulder. 
INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN 
The following morning, Rocky's ALARM CLOCK GOES OFF at exactly four A.M.  Not accustomed to rising this early, with great difficulty Rocky staggers to his feet and wavers to the bathroom.  He turns the light on and roaches scatter. 
At the top of the mirror hang the telegrams.  Rocky fills the basin and submerges his face in cold water. 
Rocky sways to the icebox and removes a dozen eggs.  He cracks five raw eggs into a glass and downs it in one swill... his body quivers. 
EXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN 
Rocky steps outside.  He is dressed in a well-worn sweat suit with a hood, gloves and sneakers.  It is pitch dark and his steaming breath attests to the cold. 
ROCKY Sure I like her. 
PAULIE (nervous laughter) What's the attraction?  I don't see it? 
ROCKY I dunno -- she fills gaps. 
PAULIE What gaps? 
ROCKY (shrugs and takes meat) She got gaps.  I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps. 
PAULIE (sharply) You ballin' her? 
ROCKY (turns around) Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister. 
PAULIE (tersely) C'mon, ya screwin' her? 
From across the room Rocky looks him hard in the eyes. 
ROCKY That's why I can't put ya together with Gazzo, cause ya talk too much -- big mouth. 
Paulie reddens.  He steps forward and slams his fists in a hanging beef. 
The punching of the beef is a muted challenge and Rocky responds. 
Rocky walks up to a beef and slams his fist into the ribs. 
The grotesque object swings in a wide arc like a hanging corpse.  Rocky moves to the next one and hooks. 
Rocky's face reveals a never before seen concentration, as though he were locked in total battle. 
PAULIE Hit the rump.  The rump! Ya'll break the ribs! 
Rocky speeds up and continues pounding on the second row of beef.  Paulie's eyes widen and his face grimaces with every punch, like he were receiving it.  Rocky moves into the dark recess of the refrigerator.  Only the dull SOUNDS of his POUNDING FISTS can be HEARD. 
Rocky works his way to Paulie again.  Every hanging beef swings and appears surrealistically alive. 
PAULIE (continuing) We do that to Creed an' they'll take us to jail for murder. 
Rocky looks at his hands.  They are drenched in red up to the elbows with beef blood. 
Paulie hands him a package of beef. 
ROCKY Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister. 
Rocky takes the package and runs out.  Paulie's bleary eyes reveal a fearful respect and slight resentment. 
INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY 
The gym is filled to capacity.  The NOISE is DEAFENING. Rocky pounds a heavy bag. 
Mickey steps forward and removes a piece of string from his pocket. 
MICKEY (passionate) Stop!  Stop!  I can't stand it! It's clumsy.  You're off balance. 
He motions to his bullish helper, Mike.  He hands him the string. 
MICKEY (continuing) Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack. 
ROCKY I never had good footwork. 
Mike completes the task. 
MICKEY Forget the footwork -- You're off balance.  The legs are sticking everywhere.  Marciano had the same problem, an' the string cured it.  When you can hit and move without breakin' the string you'll have balance. 
MIKE You'll be a very dangerous person. 
Two young boys in street clothes interrupt Mickey. 
BOY Rocky, could we have your autograph? 
ROCKY ... Sure. 
MICKEY (irate) Don't you boys ever interrupt when I'm conductin' business, or I'll kill you both -- Go away. 
The boys depart. 
MICKEY (continuing) Autographs!  Ya wanna be a writer or a fighter?  Let's work. 
Mike looks off across the gym. 
MICKEY What's happenin' here? 
DIPPER I'm happenin'!  This pig is takin' my shot -- I iz a contender.  He's nothin'. 
ROCKY (dumbstruck) Yo', Dipper, why're ya -- 
DIPPER (shaking his fist) Spar me in front of these here TV dudes -- I knock ya ass to Jersey! 
Dipper's fat black trainer holds out his hands and Dipper slaps them soul style. 
MICKEY (to Dipper) You can forget about sparring, kid. 
DIPPER Yo' know I iz the best man here!  Yo' said so yoself! 
MICKEY (almost apologetically to the crew) Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper. 
DIPPER Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too.  C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here. 
Silence looms over the gym... Apollo is apprehensive.  The scene is becoming too real.  The frightened television crew slyly begins putting away their expensive equipment. 
DIPPER (continuing; insanely) Man, yo' best keep them cameras out!  Fight me, boy! Let Creed here see the kind of punk he's fightin'! 
Mike forces his way through the crowd and stands behind Rocky. 
MIKE Don't chance it, man -- He's sick. 
MICKEY This is gettin' outta hand -- Rocky will fight in the ring January first, not here! 
DIPPER Yo' yellow, old man. 
MICKEY Not yellow, cautious. (to the crew) See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt -- 
Dipper suddenly steps forward and slaps Rocky very hard across the side of the head... The gym becomes stone cold. Dipper is in total command and enjoying every moment of it. 
DIPPER If yo're afraid to fight me, then get down an' kiss my feet, boy. 
Mickey looks nervously around and knows it's only seconds before the blood will run... Rocky stands motionless. 
MICKEY (softly) Let's take a walk, Rock. Please, don't take a chance. He wants to hurt you so you can't fight. 
Rocky swallows his pride.  He still has the string around his ankles.  He starts to shuffle away with Mickey... Dipper steps forward and viciously slaps Rocky again. 
Mike jumps forward. 
MIKE Why you tryin' to cut 'im, man! Back off, scumbag, or I'll bite your face! 
Dipper cuts loose with a hook and knocks Mike flat.  The room reeks of fear... Apollo's eyes flick back and forth between Rocky and Dipper.  Apollo taps his bodyguards and they begin to ease away. 
DIPPER ... Now, boy, kiss my feet. 
Rocky eyes his friend lying on the floor.  He shuffles forward and stands before Dipper. 
DIPPER (continuing; almost in a whisper) ... Kiss 'em. 
Rocky looks at Mickey, then lowers his eyes to Dipper's feet... Dipper smiles.  Rocky starts to bend towards the shoes.  Without warning, he explodes with a pair of combinations into Dipper's exposed ribs.  A CRACK is HEARD and Dipper sinks to the floor writhing in pain... The room is silent except for Dipper's moaning. 
Apollo is stunned by the scene.  The gym has become a very gloomy place.  He eyes Rocky with admiration and a hint of apprehension... He leaves. 
Mickey is the first one to shake off the chill... He shakes his fists at the Reporters, and puts his arm around Rocky. 
MICKEY The kid's got cannons -- Print that. 
The crowd disperses, leaving Dipper a pathetic and broken figure lying on a dirty gym floor. 
INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
They enter the dismal apartment... On the floor are at least ten telegrams.  Rocky scoops them up and tosses them aside. Next to the door is a pile of over a hundred telegrams. ADRIAN Don't you open them anymore? 
ROCKY They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag? 
Adrian steps to the window.  She pulls a pair of short but lovely curtains from a shopping bag... The colorful curtains glare in the dark room. 
ADRIAN Like? 
ROCKY Sharp -- Real nice. 
ADRIAN Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine? 
ROCKY No... Sharp -- You look great. 
Meanwhile, the trainer sits across the room in a darkened corner looking at a small television.  He is watching Rocky's bloody exhibition on the news... 
He waves at Apollo. 
TRAINER (worried) Apollo, you oughta come see this boy you're gonna fight on TV -- looks like he means business. 
Apollo is still engrossed in his paperwork. 
APOLLO I mean business, too -- (to men) The gross rental of the arena is gonna include the four hundred ushers, right? -- Gimme some coffee. 
EXT. PAULIE'S STREET - NIGHT 
It is a moonless night and Paulie staggers across the street and enters his building... He staggers up the stairs. 
INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Paulie removes his coat and tosses it listlessly in a chair... He rubs his red eyes and sways into the kitchen. 
He takes a bottle of wine out of the icebox.  As he swills the wine he hears the SOUND of Rocky's and Adrian's VOICES traveling from his sister's room.  Paulie's face tightens and he staggers towards the bedroom. 
He stands outside the bedroom door and peers through a crack... Rocky, Adrian, and the dog are watching TV in the otherwise darkened room. 
ADRIAN ... And he called the reporters -- 
ROCKY Yeah... Threw my whole day off. 
ADRIAN Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help. 
ROCKY Yo -- I ain't mad.  I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it. 
ADRIAN ... Are you going to say anything to him? 
ROCKY ... What's to say?  I dunno what he wants from me -- 
Filled with uncontrollable anger, Paulie smashes into the room. 
PAULIE Nothin'!  I want nothin' from you!!! 
ADRIAN Paulie! 
PAULIE Shutup!  I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case!  Get outta my house! 
ADRIAN It's not your house -- 
PAULIE You ain't no friend no more -- Go home!  Outta my house I want ya! 
ADRIAN Don't talk like that to him! 
PAULIE Get outta my life both of ya's. 
Paulie kicks the door out of frustration and appears to be bordering on a nervous breakdown. 
PAULIE (continuing) Outta my house I want ya!! 
ROCKY ... It's cold outside, Paulie. 
Paulie goes to the living room closet and removes a baseball bat... Rocky and Adrian quickly follow. 
PAULIE I don't want ya messin' up my sister no more -- He's scum from the corner, I don't raise ya to hang with no bum! 
Adrian is speechless... Rocky moves towards Paulie. 
PAULIE (continuing; raising the bat) ... Wanna hit on me?  C'mon -- C'mon, I'll break both ya arms so's they never work... 
Rocky freezes... 
ADRIAN ... Paulie.  Stop now! 
PAULIE I want 'im outta here -- (to Rocky) Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo? (spits) That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo! (spits again) You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs! (spits) I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too! 
ADRIAN Only a pig would say that! 
Paulie smashes a small table with the bat. 
PAULIE (to Adrian) You forget what I went through to give ya the best. 
ADRIAN You gave me what?!  Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything! 
PAULIE I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag! 
Mike has on a pair of target gloves and Rocky moves around the ring swinging at them. 
INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER 
Drenched in sweat, Rocky hums the speed bag.  His expression is hard and flushed.  Mickey clicks a stopwatch and pats Rocky's shoulder... He is very happy. 
INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER 
Rocky has just completed exercising with the medicine ball... Dino hands him a towel... Paulie crosses the gym as Rocky heads to the steam room... A thin man crosses the gym and Mickey nods. 
MICKEY What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein. 
ROCKY Yo, Benny. 
MICKEY Check the eyes, Ben. 
Benny checks the skin around Rocky's eyes. 
BENNY Ain't bad.  Seen worse -- Cover up an' things should be okay. 
MICKEY Take a shower. 
Heading towards the shower, Rocky is intercepted by Paulie who traverses the gym.  He stops Rocky at the shower room entrance. 
PAULIE Yo, Rock, I think I found an angle to make some bread usin' ya name, ya mind? 
Exhausted, Rocky studies Paulie's face a moment and nods 'yes.'... Rocky sways into the shower room and Paulie strides off. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Running... Rocky's crowd of trailing boys has tripled. Dashing through the streets, he resembles the Pied Piper. 
EXT. ART MUSEUM STAIRS - DAY 
It is twilight and Rocky is alone at the very bottom of a huge flight of steps that seem to stretch into the heavens... Rocky takes a deep breath and sprints up the never-ending stairs... Halfway up, his body shows the strain.  Nearing the top, Rocky pumps with all his strength and arrives at the very top... He looks down the steep stairs and swells with pride... He is ready. 
INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY 
Rocky is led into Mayor Rizzo's office by an aide... Rocky is very nervous as he approaches the mayor, who is seated behind his wide desk. 
MAYOR Sit down, Rocky. 
Flips open a thick file that lays in front of him. 
MAYOR (continuing) I've been going over your record -- You've been the busy type -- (reading) Nineteen arrests -- probation three times -- expelled from seven public schools in 1964 and '65. 
Rocky tries to sink into the chair. 
MAYOR (continuing) I'm a very busy man, but I just wanted to remind you that you'll be setting an example for thousands of guys like yourself and maybe start them off in a new direction and give our police force a break -- I also hope you try your very best and bring pride to Philadelphia. 
ROCKY ... I'll try. 
The mayor presses a button and a photographer enters. 
MAYOR Would you stand up, please. 
Rocky rises and the mayor shakes his hand... Their picture is taken three times... The photographer exits. 
MAYOR (continuing) Thank you for coming by, Rocky -- good luck. 
ROCKY (turns) Any time. 
MAYOR (sitting) Wait... After the fight you'll have nearly a hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- What do you plan to do with it? 
ROCKY (smiles) ... Run for mayor. 
The mayor is shocked at first but then breaks into a big, friendly laugh, and Rocky exits. 
INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Adrian and Rocky are at his apartment.  They are looking at new scrapbooks.  Newsweek Magazine: Headline: "The Italian Stallion or Donkey?" -- Philadelphia Magazine -- Rocky stands with the mayor. 
ADRIAN Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to. 
ROCKY Yeah... 
She flips through Sports Illustrated, The American Sportsman, Ring Magazine, World Boxing, True, and a multitude of other clippings. 
The TELEPHONE RINGS... Rocky rises and walks to the new white object hanging on the wall. 
ROCKY ... I can't beat him. 
ADRIAN Apollo? 
ROCKY Yeah, I can't beat him. 
Adrian touches his face. 
ROCKY I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere. 
ADRIAN What're we going to do? 
ROCKY ... I dunno. 
ADRIAN Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard. 
ROCKY It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before -- 
ADRIAN Don't say that. 
ROCKY C'mon, it's true -- But that don't bother me -- I just wanna prove somethin' -- I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed.  If I go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' I'm still standin', I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood... 
Adrian touches Rocky's face... The fighter gently lowers himself beside his woman. 
ROCKY (continuing) ... No foolin' around. 
INT. ARENA - NIGHT 
It is the night of the Bicentennial fight... The location is the Philadelphia Spectrum. 
The Spectrum is filling to capacity... Grandly dressed celebrities and wealthy fight fans lower themselves into their ringside seat.  Nearly everyone is holding a red, white, and blue sweater... 
The arena is decorated in tons of patriotic red, white and blue.  High above the ring are huge posters of GEORGE WASHINGTON - ABE LINCOLN - DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. - BEN FRANKLIN - and APOLLO CREED. 
INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
Apollo Creed sits in his dressing room... It is dead silent except for some NOISE that filters under the door from the arena. 
It is a CLOSE-UP of Apollo's hand being taped... The RASPING SOUND of the adhesive tape is very pronounced. 
INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
The atmosphere is identical to Apollo's dressing room. Adrian watches in silence as Mike wraps Rocky's hand. 
Again, the most pronounced SOUND is the RASPING of the adhesive tape. 
INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
Apollo's other hand is being wrapped.  Dead silence except for the TAPE and APOLLO'S BREATHING. 
INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
Rocky's other hand is being wrapped in a CLOSE-UP.  The only SOUND is the TAPE and ROCKY'S mounting BREATHING PATTERN. 
INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
CLOSE-UP of drops being placed in his nose to help increase his intake of oxygen.  The tremendously magnified SOUND of APOLLO TAKING IN AIR. 
INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
CLOSE-UP of the drops being placed in Rocky's nose. 
INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
A heavy coating of vaseline is applied around the Champion's eyes... In an EXTREME CLOSE-UP, the eyes shine brightly with the grease. 
INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
Grease is smeared around Rocky's eyes... In the EXTREME CLOSE-UP several deep scars are SEEN. 
INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
CLOSE-UP of Apollo's trainer digging his fingers deeply into the thick neck muscles of Apollo's upper back and neck. 
INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
CLOSE-UP OF Mike's arms wrapped around Rocky's waist and lifting his diaphragm up... Magnified BREATHING ROARS from the screen. 
INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
COMMENTATOR #1 Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Round three... Apollo comes out dancing.  He skips and side- steps Rocky's sledgehammer hooks.  An expert ring general, Apollo uses the ring fully.  Rocky keeps tearing in and Creed meets the bombing attack that cause thick swelling... Near the end of the round Rocky fires a penetrating punch to the heart. 
COMMENTATOR #1 Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations.  Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes.  The Champ backs off. 
COMMENTATOR #2 There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power. 
COMMENTATOR #1 No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. (MORE) 
COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D) Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt. 
The wallop knocks Apollo off balance... The CAMERA GOES TO A STEEP ANGLE SHOT from the floor, VERTICALLY UP Apollo's body. The SCENE GOES INTO SLOW MOTION... Rocky releases a terrifying uppercut that opens a gash under Creed's eye. Creed's face contorts with excruciation. 
TRAINER (yelling) Cover your face!  Cover up! (to Assistant) My man's cut, my man's bleedin' -- Get ready! 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
The BELL SOUNDS.  Apollo's corner works frantically to close the wound... The ring DOCTOR inspects the cut. 
TRAINER Bad?  Talk to me, man! 
DOCTOR Deep, but passable. 
APOLLO (staring at Rocky) ... That man's takin' his job too serious. 
TRAINER He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear?  Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play. 
APOLLO He got lucky. 
TRAINER Luck!  You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad. (to Assistant) More ice, now! 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Rocky's face is in very bad shape, not cut, but wretchedly swollen around the eyes. 
MICKEY How you holdin' up, kid? 
ROCKY Fine... That guy's great. 
MICKEY Gimme the water!  Ya getttin' tagged with his right.  I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes!  Can ya see? 
ROCKY (standing) See what? 
MIKE Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam. 
ROCKY He ain't losin' nothin'. 
MICKEY Keep on him -- You're doin' great. 
SERIES OF SHOTS 
In the next ten rounds, Apollo cuts and slashes Rocky to ribbons, but pays dearly... Both his eyes and lips are cut. Welts across his midsection attest to Rocky's body-battering. 
INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
Adrian is unable to remain alone... She is lured by the GROWING ROAR OF THE FANS... She exits the dressing room. 
INT. ARENA HALL - NIGHT 
Stepping out of the dressing room she walks down the corridor. The MOUNTING CHEERS make her speed up.  She opens the door at the end of the corridor and is hit by a THUNDEROUS WAVE OF SOUND.  The guard at the door inspects her and goes back to watching the fight. 
INT. ARENA - NIGHT 
Adrian stands at the rear of the arena and watches the battle.  She is entranced by the power of it all. 
Back in the ring, Rocky keeps grinding ahead.  He plants a thumping left over the Champion's heart and Creed winces... Rocky is game but losing. 
At ringside Paulie is frantic... He is living the fight from his seat. 
Mr. Gazzo and his Bodyguard watch from the second row. Gazzo looks proud.  The Bodyguard, impassive. 
INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT 
A huge and lively crowd look up at the television over the bar... They see Rocky driving Creed against the ropes and cheer loudly. 
ANDY ... The Rock's got real stones. 
TRAINER Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight. 
APOLLO ... Stop jivin'! 
TRAINER Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best! 
APOLLO ... Thanks. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Rocky no longer resembles himself... His face has completely been beaten to jelly, but his mood is buoyant. 
ROCKY How I look out there, Mick? 
MICKEY (truly worried) Great, kid, great. 
The ring Doctor leans over Rocky and checks the eyes. 
DOCTOR One more round -- How do you feel? 
Rocky is approaching the supreme moment of his life.  He cannot be bothered with pain or doctors. 
ROCKY Fine -- Go away, I'm gonna make it -- I'm gonna make it! 
Everyone is distraught over Rocky's dangerous condition. 
MICKEY We gotta stop it, kid. 
MIKE Ya gave it ya best shot! 
MICKEY Nobody's gonna say ya didn't give ya all.  I can't let ya go out. 
Rocky stands and eyes them all. 
ROCKY (impassioned and quietly) I'll kill ya all... Don't stop nothin' -- 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
The BELL RINGS... Apollo moves cautiously out of his corner and circles to Rocky's right. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
The Commentators stare unansweringly at the fighters. 
COMMENTATOR #1 The fight has slowed down to a near stand-still -- Creed circles to Rocky's right... The spectrum is nearly silent -- Neither fighter has made a motion to throw... I've never seen anything like it in the last round of a championship fight... Apollo spits blood on the canvas.  It appears he is protecting his right side.  His ribs were probably injured at the end of round fourteen. (MORE) 
COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D) It's confirmed, unofficially, Creed's ribs may be broken -- Apollo fakes a left and throws a big tired right -- Balboa's mouthpiece is out!  Creed attacks with one hand! 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Apollo feints and Rocky falls for it.  The Champion unleashes a lethal blow to the side of the head that jolts Rocky's mouthpiece into the second row... Rocky sags against the ropes in a crucified position... The insane crowd leaps to their feet. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Rocky's bloody teeth snarl at Apollo and he waves him to come ahead and fight toe to toe... Apollo obliges with a weary but effective burst of rights and lefts that have K.O. written on every punch.  Rocky counters the assault blow for blow. 
ROCKY Gimme ya best!!!! 
Mickey looks at the clock... TEN SECONDS TO GO. 
ROCKY (continuing) Gimme ya best!!! 
Blood sprays over the ropes and onto the ringside photographers... They are horrified and wipe away the blood. 
The fighters stand toe to toe and drag every remaining bit of strength from their souls and beat each other without mercy.  They look hypnotized and have entered a dimension far beyond blood and pain. 
SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE! 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
The BELL RINGS... The arena EXPLODES with thunderous approval. 
Their cornermen rush to their collapsed fighters... In the midst of all the confusion both fighters look at each other with unabashed respect -- They stand like blood-drenched gladiators on the most dramatic night of their lives. 
As though reacting to some unspoken command, they both step towards each other and embrace... Apollo whispers in Rocky's ear. 
APOLLO ... Ain't gonna be no rematch. 
ROCKY ... Don't want one.

TOBY It almost makes me want to see Roy -- he was the only one could make the thing stop overheating. (a beat) My God, he was boring. Boring and mean: you sure got crappy taste in boyfriends. At the mention of Roy's name, Caroline lightly touches the bruise on her right cheekbone. Not enjoying the talk about Roy, she pours the water into the radiator, and speaks directly to the car. CAROLINE I'd like to burn you to the ground. (to Toby; big smile) Let's go get rich in Salt Lake City! 
8    EXT. SALT LAKE CITY (DOWNTOWN) - DAY                       8 Toby waits beside the Nash Ambassador, looking toward a three-story concrete building. He holds a portable RADIO, which PLAYS DEAN MARTIN singing "Volare." 
9    INT. BUILDING - PARALLEL TIME                              9 Caroline, holding the imitation Geiger counter, stands across the counter from a MAN who is looking at her very strangely. MAN You're pulling my leg, right? CAROLINE No, I came here to look for uranium. MAN My God, lady. If you're looking for uranium, why didn't you go to Moab? CAROLINE We went there, but everybody'd beaten us there. We were too late. MAN So you came here just on the chance you'd find uranium? Listen, you mind me saying something to you might sound rude? Lady, you got more courage than you got common sense. 
10   EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - DAY                                 10 Caroline exits the building, dumps the Geiger counter in a trash can and strides to the car. She gets in, and says two words: CAROLINE Don't ask. 
11   INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - DAY                                 11 Caroline turns the key in the ignition and gets only a maddening RER-RER-RER-RER noise from the ENGINE: wearily, she rests her forehead on the steering wheel. 
12   EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - TWENTY MINUTES LATER             12 Caroline and Toby have the hood up and are peering into the engine. TOBY That mechanic in Colorado said it needed points. CAROLINE I know. Don't tell me what I already know. This thing's a bottomless pit. I don't know what to do. No matter how much money I pour into it... Suddenly a WOMAN in pedal-pushers and a thin, inexpensive sweater stops. She's vaguely low-class, but friendly and sympathetic. WOMAN I'd rather be whipped with a belt than have car trouble. 'Course these days I don't have to worry about that. My husband got laid off at the mill, and they repossessed the car, so wherever I wanna go, I just have to hoof it, you know? Caroline smiles, then her face changes. CAROLINE You don't have    a car? (as the    Woman shakes    her head) You want this    one? 
Shocked, the Woman says -- WOMAN I... uh... I... TOBY You're gonna give our car away? CAROLINE (to the Woman) Seriously. It needs points, and it overheats constantly, but you can have it if you want it, because my hand to God, I can't look at it one more minute. WOMAN Well, sure... (CONTINUED) 
12   CONTINUED:                                              12 CAROLINE Get the bags out. Get the owner's slip out of the glove compartment. We're rid of this son-of-a-bitch pink and white albatross. You don't mind taking a car with a big dent in the passenger door? WOMAN Hell, no. (she looks) There's no dent there... Caroline draws back her leg and delivers a terrific, flat-footed kick to the door, leaving a dent the size of a dish-pan. CAROLINE Oh, yes there is! Toby hands the Woman the owner's slip, Caroline gives her the keys. WOMAN ... you really just giving me this car? CAROLINE It's done. It's yours. You got yourself a Nash Ambassador! (to Toby) Let's go! Both of them pick up two bags apiece -- all they have in the world -- and off they go, feeling good. 
13   EXT. CITY STREET - DAY (FEW MINUTES LATER)                   13 1957 is all around us: gas is 29.9 cents a gallon; bread is 19 cents a loaf; cars are curved and heavily chromed; people occasionally nod and smile at strangers; children carry hula hoops. In all, a gentler time. Caroline and Toby stride along briskly, as if they knew where they were going. CAROLINE ... find ourselves a cheap room someplace, we'll get you into school, I'll brush up on my typing and get a job, and things'll start looking up. I feel it: the good times are coming. And at least we're rid of that damn Nash Ambassador! (CONTINUED) 
17    INT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S KITCHEN - ONE HOUR LATER           17 Caroline, Toby and ROY are eating at the tiny table. Roy is good-looking in a meaty, hairy-chested sort of way. Though he is on his very best behavior just now, there is a mean streak in him. Toby, delighted, holds a Winchester .22 rifle across his lap -- a peace-making gift from Roy. (CONTINUED) 
17   CONTINUED:                                               17 ROY ... I found me a room, but it's clear the hell and gone 'cross town. And I think I got a job lined up doin' tune-ups in a Texaco station. How you like it at Winstead's? CAROLINE How do you know where I work? ROY I been here almost a week. CAROLINE You followed me around?    For a week? Watching? Roy doesn't answer.   He just wiggles his eyebrows like Groucho Marx. CAROLINE And how did you ever find me? Again, Roy does the Groucho Marx.    He turns to Toby. ROY You like the rifle, Toby?    'Jack,' I mean. TOBY It's the best present I ever got. I just love it. (to Caroline) I'm going to pretend I'm shooting. 
CAROLINE Don't point that thing at anybody or I won't teach you to shoot. TOBY It's not loaded! CAROLINE You heard me:    anybody or any thing. TOBY It's got no bullets, for God's sake. CAROLINE Don't make me speak to you again. (CONTINUED) 
17   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             17 TOBY I'll point it at the sky, then. Caroline sighs. Toby opens a screenless window and points the gun up into the night sky, pretending to fire it over and over. Caroline starts to clear the table. Roy jumps up to help her. 
18   INT. LIVING ROOM - TWO HOURS LATER                           18 Caroline and Roy are   kissing on the sofa, and he is all over her: his hands    are on her breasts, her thighs, everywhere. Aroused    in spite of herself, Caroline pulls away, indicating the   light in the other room. 
CAROLINE Don't.   Toby's still up. Roy leans back, smiling, and eyes Caroline. ROY You are one sweet thing, baby: just the sight of you makes my dick hard. He pulls her to him, starting to kiss her. She fends him off, looking worriedly toward the room where Toby's light burns. ROY Aw, he won't hear anything. Again he pulls her toward him; again she turns her head from the kiss. 
Then it happens. A spasm of anger passes across his face and he shoves Caroline away from him. It's a hard shove, but nothing that could really hurt her. Violence has happened before between these two, and they recognize it. Caroline is immediately on guard, and Roy is apologetic. ROY Shit, baby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. I'm just so glad to see you. He slides toward Caroline, kisses her. This time she accepts the kiss -- feels she has no choice. 
19   INT. KITCHEN - PARALLEL TIME                                  19 Dressed for bed, Toby stands by an open window. He can hear every WORD of ROY'S, who continues to apologize between kisses. The room is illuminated by a nearby streetlamp. The frosty air from the open window causes his breath to steam. He raises two fingers to his lips, pretends to take a drag on a cigarette and blows out the steam from his breath. The VOICES in the other room grow a bit LOUDER, almost to an argument, and then SUBSIDE again. Toby takes another drag from his pretend cig- arette. He looks very young. 
20   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - AFTERNOON                           20 Toby wanders toward the rooming house. He stops to watch TWO fiftyish WOMEN who are working in a garden. One Woman looks up. WOMAN #1 Hi. TOBY Hello. The Woman stops to take a breather, lights a cigarette, pokes her companion. WOMAN #1 My Lord, look at the eyes on him -- won't he be a heartbreaker in three, four years? WOMAN #2 Bedroom eyes. Toby smiles. 
24A   EXT. TRACT HOUSE/FURTHER DOWN STREET - AFTERNOON          24A From one of the houses TERRY TAYLOR emerges, falling into step with Toby. He's Toby's age, and is almost an exact replica of him. TOBY Hey, Terry. TERRY TAYLOR Hey, Jack. What'd your mom say about skipping school today? TOBY Who listens? TERRY TAYLOR You go over to Wanda's house last night? (as Toby nods) You make out good? (as Toby nods again) How good? TOBY I fucked her 'til her nose bled. TERRY TAYLOR Sure you did!    Oh, Wolff, you're rich. 
25    INT. APARTMENT - AFTERNOON                                25 TERRY SILVER opens the door to admit Toby and Terry Taylor. Silver is a clone of both Toby and Terry Taylor. 
26   INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON                                  26 As the three boys troop through the room, they pass Terry Silver's two SISTERS, who are sprawled sensually on a sofa. SISTER #1 Oh look -- it's Elvis, Elvis, and Elvis. TERRY TAYLOR Excuse me, but does your face hurt? 'Cause it's killing me. With that piece of high wit, they're out of the room. 
27   INT. TV ROOM - AFTERNOON                                27 The boys light up three cigarettes (opening a window so the smoke will disappear), then throw themselves onto the floor in front of a black-and-white TV. Superman is ON. When Lois Lane comes on, Terry Taylor starts moaning as if sexually aroused; Terry Silver jumps to his knees and licks the TV screen repeatedly, also moaning. Toby closes his eyes, also as if in sexual transport. TOBY Oh, Lois. Oh, baby, come here -- I got six hot inches just waiting for you. TERRY TAYLOR Man, look at her! Look at that body-y-y-y. 
TERRY SILVER (continues licking screen) Um-m-m-m. M-M-M. Oh, Annette, I want you. I want you so bad. TOBY Oh, babybabybabybabybaby... You make my dick hard! The three carry on for a few more seconds. THREE OF THEM Yum, yum, yum. (CONTINUED) 
27    CONTINUED:                                             27 Making wet kissing noises, or just rocking their heads back and forth as if tempted beyond endurance. Then, slowly, they shut up and lie back down. 
27A   SAME SCENE - LATER                                           27A And this is what they really wanted: absolutely silent, all three boys stare fixedly at the screen. They are totally absorbed, caught up in the sweetness and warmth of the show. Not one of these boys has ever touched a girl's breast; all three are at least two years from their first shave; all three are pre-pubescent, and their sexuality is all bravado -- now we see them for what they are: three skinny-armed 13-year-olds, fascinated by Superman. 
28    INT. TOBY AND CAROLINE'S KITCHEN - DUSK                      28 Caroline pirouettes for her two roommates, KATHY, a diffident, sweet-faced young woman, and MARIAN, a heavyset, loud, red-faced woman who eats compulsively from a package of oatmeal cookies. Both of the women ooh and aah over Caroline's dress. KATHY That belt just makes it. CAROLINE It does pick up the green, doesn't it? MARIAN And you say he's getting serious already? CAROLINE Yes, I think. He keeps talking about marriage, keeps saying he wants to meet Toby. MARIAN Well, that's it -- three dates and you got 'im good. CAROLINE I don't know if I want him -- She stops as Toby enters the kitchen. (CONTINUED) 
28   CONTINUED:                                               28 TOBY Don't want who? KATHY (about Toby) Little pitchers... MARIAN Well, it's the tough guy who can't be bothered to go to school. CAROLINE (to Toby) Oh, it's nothing -- we were talking about Dwight. I told you about Dwight. TOBY He the one drives down from the boondocks? The mechanic? Dwight. What a stupid name. (he draws the name out) Dwiiiight. Duhhhhwight. Dwight-tah-h-h-h. Dwighttahhhhh. There is a KNOCK    on the front door. Toby sticks his head around the door,    looking into the living room. A man is outlined against    the sunset, only his black silhouette is visible. It is     our first glimpse of DWIGHT. Has the man heard him?     Toby doesn't know for sure. Caroline brings Dwight into the kitchen.     He is older than her, an attractive-enough man. He     is well-built, has a full head of brown hair, and very    white teeth. Those are his good points. On the minus     side: his over- eagerness to please, his nervous smiles    and his clothes. He wears two-tone shoes, a hand-painted    tie, and a monogrammed handkerchief, folded beyond    perfection, in the pocket. Caroline introduces him to Marian and Kathy.     Then she introduces Dwight to Toby. Dwight is all smiles. CAROLINE Would you like coffee before we go? Or a Coke? DWIGHT You know, I believe I could stand a cup of java. (CONTINUED) 
31   EXT. ROAD - MORNING                                        31 We see Dwight driving his shiny Buick, Caroline and Toby beside him. As the CAMERA TRACKS the car with VARIOUS SHOTS, we hear: DWIGHT (V.O.) ... air like wine at my place, and I don't mind saying I wouldn't live anywhere else, and that's the God's honest truth. There's good schools, honest people, and some of the best fishing in the world. Ted Williams -- you like baseball, Toby? That is, Jack, I mean -- you like baseball? 'Cause Ted Williams, whom I believe is one of the all-time greats, is also a world-class angler. Many's the day he and I've talked over the best way to get a fish to say yes to a hook. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
31    CONTINUED:                                                   31 DWIGHT (V.O.) (CONT'D) (a beat) Hunting, too: there's game everywhere you look. I don't think I flatter myself by saying that I'm something of a whiz with a rifle, and Concrete gives me every opportunity to prove it... 
32    EXT. SMALL BRIDGE - DAY                                      32 The three stand by the edge of the bridge, looking down into the water. 
They see salmon fighting the last few yards of their yearly battle to spawn. Against the rapid current, they leap again and again. Long strips of flesh hang from their bodies. DWIGHT They always show you salmon fighting to get upstream, but they never show you what they look like when they get there. Her face strained, Caroline leans over for a closer look. The salmon swim in slow, stunned circles, some with an eye missing or hanging by a membrane, a hideous sight. CAROLINE It's pitiful.     Awful. DWIGHT They'll spawn, and then they'll die. They're dying now. 
As Toby and Caroline move to the passenger side of the car, Toby speaks so Dwight can't hear: TOBY I hope to hell it's not an omen. Caroline has to fight back a smile. 
A33   EXT. CONCRETE SILO - DAY                               A33 The Buick drives into town past an enormous disused Concrete silo where "Welcome To Concrete" is painted in huge faded letters. (CONTINUED) 
26A. A33   CONTINUED:                                                  A33 DWIGHT So here we go. Welcome to Concrete. Dwight's home sweet home. Finest people in the whole state of Washington, you ask me. Lots of churches, too. A neighbor of mine says, "Looking for nice churches, come to Concrete. Looking for sin, go to hell." I think that's funny... Caroline and Toby are severely underimpressed with their first impression of Concrete. 
33    EXT. DWIGHT'S HOUSE - DAY                                   33 Dwight's Buick pulls to a stop; Dwight, Caroline, and Toby get out. The scenery is as beautiful as Dwight said it was. DWIGHT All the houses are converted Army barracks, made into duplexes -- Three children exit the    house. SKIPPER, a pleasant boy who is average in every    way, is 17. NORMA is 18, slow- spoken and sensual, Toby    cannot take his eyes off her. The third is PEARL, two    years younger than Toby. Pearl has a bald spot the size    of a dollar, high on the side of her head. DWIGHT Well. Let's see here. Kids, this is my pretty friend, Caroline Wolff, and her boy To... (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
33   CONTINUED:                                              33 DWIGHT (CONT'D) (he catches himself) Jack Wolff. These are my kids: Skipper, Norma and my baby, Pearl. Everybody says hello, shakes hands, then they all head into the house. 
36   INT. DWIGHT'S LIVING ROOM - HOUR LATER                        36 Dwight has recovered his good mood. Dressed in a marksman's coat with a padded shoulder, Dwight is laughing as he attempts to assemble Toby's Winchester .22. (CONTINUED) 
36   CONTINUED:                                              36 DWIGHT 'Turkey shoot' is just a figure of speech. TOBY There's no real turkey? DWIGHT No, it's just regulation paper targets. It's a test of skill. (a beat) And, Jack, I just found out yesterday that they won't let kids shoot. 
TOBY But you said I could! DWIGHT I know, but they got it all screwed up somehow and told me wrong at first. Toby starts to argue, but Caroline touches his arm. CAROLINE Dwight, you did tell him. DWIGHT (an edge) I don't make the rules, Caroline. If I made the rules, I might make different ones, but I don't make the rules. 
37   EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY                                         37 A sullen Toby stands with Pearl. Dwight is giving his name and the entry fee to a MAN. As the Man moves away, Caroline stops him and holds out some money. CAROLINE Wolff.   Caroline Wolff. MAN You mean you want to enter? I think it's against the rules. (CONTINUED) 
37   CONTINUED:                                             37 CAROLINE Well, that sign says this is an N.R.A. club, and I'm a dues-paying N.R.A. member. That gives me the right to participate in the activities of other chapters. MAN You'll be the only woman shooting. Caroline just smiles. The Man shrugs, takes her money and writes down her name. 
38   EXT. SHOOTING RANGE - DAY                                    38 
The shooting match has begun. The contestants have ten turns to fire ten shots apiece at a large paper bull's-eye fifty yards away. The scores and rankings are on a portable scoreboard. A contestant finishes SHOOTING. There is a pause. Everyone watches as his score is raised from behind the concrete wall on which the bull's-eye hangs. The score comes:     84. There is a smattering of applause, and it's Dwight's turn. From his stance, Dwight looks as if he is a pretty good shot. He's nervous, though, because Caroline is going to shoot, and he squeezes off his TEN SHOTS in RAPID SUCCESSION, hardly pausing to breathe. A pause, and then his score is raised: 73. Dwight smiles an inappropriate smile and hands the Winchester to Caroline. 
There are a couple of whistles as Caroline takes her position, and someone in the crowd yells out, "Oh, Mama, shake that thang!" Caroline ignores it, taking her shooting stance, which is surprisingly graceful and professional-looking. She SHOOTS her TEN BULLETS, taking time to breathe once, deeply, between each shot. The pause, and her score is raised: 93. There is a moment of surprised silence, and then the crowd gives Caroline a sincere round of applause. 
SAME SCENE - LATER Dwight looks stunned, and Toby is almost equally surprised. (CONTINUED) 
Toby nods. Silver     and Taylor howl with laughter. Furious, Toby says    "Fuck you" over and over. He pulls out a rat-tail and    scratches the words "FUCK YOU" onto the soft paint of    the bathroom wall. 
43   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - AFTERNOON                           43 Toby stands at the top of a small hill with Terry Silver and Terry Taylor. They are too casual, their faces too innocent: something's up. They wait until a middle-aged man raking leaves turns and disappears around a corner. Then the three of them open the door of a car, take off the emergency brake, and start it rolling down the hill. (CONTINUED) 
43   CONTINUED:                                             43 The car rolls silently down the hill. It CRASHES into another car at the bottom, making a LOUD NOISE. The three boys run like the wind out of sight. 
44   INT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                     44 Caroline, Toby, Marian and Kathy sit at the table eating dinner. KATHY ... exactly what I wanted for my dress. It's a Simplicity pattern, and I'm pretty sure I can make it myself. It's got big puff sleeves... Caroline takes out a cigarette. Then everybody jumps as Toby yells and jumps up knocking his chair over backwards. TOBY Oh! Toby grabs Caroline's lighter, and begins to imitate Dwight: saying, "Oh!" and "Oh, yes!" and Oh, my!" and "Here, let me!" and "I'll do that!" It's a mean, accurate imitation of Dwight. All three women laugh in spite of themselves. Caroline keeps saying "Jack, that's enough," and Marian says, "Dwight's not that bad." But they can't help laughing. Toby offers the other two women a light, then offers a broom, the back door, and the refrigerator a light. 
45   INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY                                45 The principal, MR. SHIPPY, sits behind his desk. Toby, looking scared, sits across from him. A secretary lets Caroline into the room. Mr. Shippy rises and introduces himself. Caroline doesn't respond to the introduction. CAROLINE What did he do? MR. SHIPPY He violated the school property and flouted the law. CAROLINE Can you say that in English? (CONTINUED) 
45   CONTINUED:                                                  45 MR. SHIPPY He wrote obscene words on the wall. CAROLINE (to Toby) Did you do it? (as he shakes his head "no") He didn't do it. MR. SHIPPY (strong) He wrote obscene words on the wall. 
CAROLINE What obscene words? MR. SHIPPY (after a beat) 'Fuck you.' CAROLINE That's one obscene word. Mr. Shippy looks stymied.   There is a pause. MR. SHIPPY Look, Mrs. Wolff, Jack's teachers, like him but they think he's fallen in with the wrong kind of friends. (peers at Toby's hand) Is that nicotine stain on your fingers? (as Toby shakes his head "no") I hope not. Let me tell you a story: I started smoking in college. Two packs a day. I ate 'em. (a beat) One night I went to have a cigarette and lo and behold, the pack was empty. I went downstairs and started to rummage through the garbage cans. But as I reached down -- I mean, right down into a garbage can -- I suddenly thought, 'Whoa. Hold on right there, Buster.' I went back to my room and to this day I haven't smoked another cigarette. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
45    CONTINUED:   (2)                                               45 MR. SHIPPY (CONT'D) (a beat) After that, every day I saved the exact amount of money I would've spent on cigarettes. In three years, I put it all together, and you know what I bought? I bought myself... (a dramatic pause; big finish) ... a Nash Ambassador. Caroline gives a bark of laughter. She brings out a handkerchief and coughs, as if she has a cold. Mr. Shippy looks puzzled. 
MR. SHIPPY Well, back to the point:   I think two weeks' suspension. 
51   INT. BUICK - NIGHT                                              51 Dwight is still drinking, between swallows, he gives Toby sneering glances. Dwight is driving very fast. The road begins a series of curves. Dwight doesn't slow down, and the TIRES begin to SCREAM on the curves. The road runs along a steep gorge. Dwight increases the speed, and the car begins to fishtail. TOBY I'm a little sick to my stomach. DWIGHT Sick to your stomach?   A hotshot like you? TOBY I'm not a hotshot. (CONTINUED) 
51   CONTINUED:                                                    51 DWIGHT That's what I hear. I hear you're a real hotshot. Come and go where you please, do what you please. Isn't that right? Yeah, regular man about town. Performer, too. That right, Jack? You a performer? TOBY No, sir. DWIGHT That's a goddamned lie. Dwight keeps glancing from the road to Toby, and back again. DWIGHT If there's one thing I can't stomach, it's a liar. TOBY I'm not a liar. DWIGHT Sure you are. You or Marian. Is Marian a liar? She says you're quite the little performer. Is that a lie? You tell me that's a lie and we'll drive back to Seattle so you can call her a liar to her face. You want me to do that? TOBY No. 
DWIGHT Then you must be the one's a liar, right? (as Toby nods) And you're a performer? TOBY I guess. DWIGHT You guess? You guess? Let's see your act. Go on. Do your act. (when Toby is silent) I'm waiting. TOBY I can't. (CONTINUED) 
51   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              51 DWIGHT Sure you can. TOBY No, sir. DWIGHT Do me.     I hear you do me. Again Toby shakes his head, and then gasps as the CAR SKIDS hideously close to the cliff's edge. Dwight is oblivious to the danger. DWIGHT Yeah, I hear you're good at doing me. Here. Do me with the lighter. Go on. Take it. Dwight holds out the velvet-covered Zippo, driving with one hand, and the car is all over the road. Dwight puts the lighter back into his pocket. The car slows a bit. DWIGHT Hotshot. You pull that hotshot stuff around me and I'll break every bone in your body. You understand me? (a beat) You're in for a change, mister. You got that? Huh? You got that good? (so scary) You're in for a whole 'nother ballgame. 
52   EXT. DWIGHT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   52 Dwight's Buick pulls to a stop as Norma, Skipper and Pearl come out to meet them. Dwight is calmer now. DWIGHT Skipper, go get that washtub out back, and Pearl, bring the hose around and fill it up. Hotshot and me hit a beaver. We'll salt him down. Skipper and Pearl move out on the run. Dwight slits the beaver from throat to testicles, guts it, then pulls the skin off. (CONTINUED) 
52   CONTINUED:                                                     52 DWIGHT I know you think you're better than me. Caroline told me all about your rich daddy and your prep-school brother, but your fancy days are over: you're a Concrete boy now. I'm gonna give you a big injection of Concrete. That's right -- inoculate you. Oh, my, yes. You're gonna find out that in Concrete we have to be able to do more than sing Fats Domino songs, we work... Skipper and Pearl bring the tub with four blue stars painted on its side, Dwight plops the skinned beaver into the water. The hairless carcass stands in the tub, its chin on the edge. Pearl shudders and turns away. 
53   INT. DWIGHT'S KITCHEN - SAME NIGHT (LATER)                     53 Dwight, Toby, Norma, Skipper and Pearl are eating dinner at the kitchen table. Norma speaks to Toby. NORMA You'll be in Miss Graham's class? TOBY Yeah, is she nice? NORMA She's okay.   She's pretty. TOBY I hate changing schools. DWIGHT Speaking of changing, I had a talk with Jack on the way up here, and he says he wants to be a better boy. And that's good, 'cause things weren't going well for him in Seattle: the police actually came to his house to talk to Caroline about him. Uh-huh, the police. PEARL (very low; to Toby) Criminal. (CONTINUED) 
53   CONTINUED:                                                   53 DWIGHT So here's what I think: I think idle hands are the devil's workshop, and so I found our Jack a little something to do. (to Toby) I picked up two barrels of horse- chestnuts in the park. You can spend your evenings hulling 'em. And I enrolled you in the Boy Scouts, and you've got a paper route, starting Monday, every afternoon from three to six-thirty -- pays fifty-five bucks a month. What d'you say? 
Toby glances around the table, he is subdued. TOBY I'll do it. (means it) I want to be... better. DWIGHT That's what I like to hear. Okay, you guys get these dishes cleaned up. Let's show Jack how we do it in Concrete. 
62   EXT. CAROLINE'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON                             62 
Toby and Caroline walk slowly, idly down the rail tracks. Toby avoids her eyes. CAROLINE How is it in Concrete? TOBY It's fine. CAROLINE School? TOBY School's school. My grades are okay. CAROLINE You haven't been in any trouble? (as he shakes his head) Good. How're you and Dwight? TOBY He made us all snowcream, like he said. CAROLINE Stop that, honey. TOBY What? CAROLINE (stops walking) Well, you've got your eyes out of focus. Look at me. Now, are things all right? (CONTINUED) 
62   CONTINUED:                                               62 TOBY I'm fine. CAROLINE You swear?   You act odd. TOBY No, I'm fine. CAROLINE Well, good. I'd feel awful if it hadn't worked out. A pause. 
CAROLINE I told Dwight I'd marry him. In two weeks. I don't know what else to do. I mean, he's been helping me with the rent since Kathy left. And you need a father. I think it's the best thing all the way around -- what d'you think? There is a pause as they look at each other. TOBY I think it's the best thing. CAROLINE I think it's the best thing, too. Caroline smiles, smooths his hair, then goes into the house. Toby continues to walk. Suddenly, he spins around and tears out toward the house. By God, he'll tell her just what's been going on. He bangs through the front door and up the stairs. 
63   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                         63 Toby stops dead as he sees Dwight and Caroline locked in a busy kiss. He stops dead and shrinks back into the hallway, defeated. DISSOLVE TO: 
64   INT. SKIPPER AND TOBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                        64 Toby is alone in the room    in his Boy Scout shirt and hat in front of a mirror. A     copy of Boy's Life magazine is open in front of him with    drawings of Indians performing sign language. Watching     himself in the mirror, Toby makes a sign. (CONTINUED) 
64    CONTINUED:                                            64 TOBY Hungry. He makes another sign. TOBY Food. He makes another sign. TOBY Want. He makes another sign. 
TOBY Great mystery. He makes another sign. TOBY Father. He stares silently at himself in the mirror. 
A65   INT. DWIGHT'S LIVING ROOM - DAY                             A65 Tarpaulins are everywhere. Toby stands surrounded by seven five-gallon cans of paint. Carrying paintbrushes, Dwight enters, dressed in old clothes singing "In The Still Of The Night." DWIGHT Now that's a song. Not all this Elvis Presley shit. Elvis sings about like I do brain surgery. He imitates Elvis -- moves his hips slightly and sings a few notes: DWIGHT '... uh-huh-huh, my blue suede shoes.' Dwight gives Toby a flash of his teeth and Toby smiles back. DWIGHT Let's get this place ready for Caroline. They begin painting.   After only a few strokes, though, Toby looks doubtful. (CONTINUED) 
73   CONTINUED:                                              73 Dwight sits down next to Toby, eager for details. DWIGHT How'd it start? TOBY I called him a sissy. Dwight hoots with laughter and slaps his leg. DWIGHT Well, he sure's hell can't sue you for slander. That boy fights for the pink team. Did you make him cry? 
TOBY Well... he was just ready to. I called him a big-assed, squat- to-pee sissy. (as Dwight slaps his leg again) I'd have won bigger except he hit me when I wasn't looking. DWIGHT (suddenly serious) He dry-gulched you. Now that's your fault. You gotta keep your guard up. There's no excuse for getting dry-gulched. I'll show you a couple moves after supper that'll leave Miss Arthur Gayle wondering what month it is. 
74   INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING                                    74 Still excited, Dwight is holding forth for the whole family. (We hear THUNDER of an approaching storm) DWIGHT ... so he says, 'You and who else's army?' 'Just the three of us,' I say. 'Me, myself and I.' (a beat) Well, after school he's waiting for me and he yells something -- I tell you, with people like that, you got to hurt 'em, gotta inflict pain, or they'll never leave you alone. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
74   CONTINUED:                                             74 DWIGHT (CONT'D) (a beat) So it was real hot out, okay? And there were these horse turds laying all over the place. I picked one up and went up to him, but not acting tough, okay? Acting more like, 'Oh gee, I'm so scared, please don't hurt me.' Sort of like this: Dwight slumps his shoulders, drops his chin, and looks up through his eyebrows, a simpering expression on his face. DWIGHT So I say, 'Excuse me, but what's the problem?' And he starts in on me again, blah, blah, blah, and I jam a horse turd right into that big mouth. Then I give him a sucker punch in the breadbasket, and he goes down like a... Dwight goes on, relishing the story. 
75   EXT. UTILITY PORCH - NIGHT                                   75 A steady downpour falls outside the porch. Dwight and Toby, both stripped to the waist, are boxing. Dwight is totally serious about this, absolutely sincere. The sweat streaming off the two, Dwight patiently corrects Toby's movements, or catches the boy's fist to suggest better form. Their feet shuffle, squeak on the floor. DWIGHT No, no. From the shoulder. Straight. (demonstrates) Like this. This. Otherwise you leave yourself wide open. (as Toby tries) Yeah, better, better... and keep those feet moving, shuffle, shuffle, that's right... now try for my face... good... 
76   INT. LIVING ROOM - PARALLEL TIME                             76 Caroline is on the telephone, her voice low. (Behind her, through a doorway, we can see Dwight and Toby boxing.) (CONTINUED) 
76   CONTINUED:                                              76 CAROLINE ... not good, to tell you the truth not good at all. (listens) No, he's not mean to me... (listens again) No, he's good about that: comes home right after work every night. (listens again) Oh, Marian, I don't know -- maybe I just got my hopes too high, although I don't think so. All I want is a little... (searches) ... a little son-of-a-bitching sweetness. That's all. (listens; laughs) You think so, huh? You always did have an eye for Dwight, didn't you? (leans back; watches Dwight and Toby) The thing is, he's out on the porch teaching Jack to box right now. I keep thinking if I can hang on, things'll settle down. If I can just hang on long enough, it'll work out and my kid'll have a father. You know? 
77   EXT. UTILITY PORCH - LATER                                    77 Both Dwight and Toby sweating heavily.    They lean against a wall, resting. 
TOBY You said you'd show me how to dry-gulch somebody. DWIGHT Okay. Now you can always  kick somebody in the balls, but I like this one better: What you  do is hit 'em in the throat with the side of your forearm. You  wait 'til -- hah! Without warning, Dwight lunges at Toby and swings the side of his arm toward Toby's throat. Toby dodges wildly, falling backward over a box of sports equipment. (CONTINUED) 
82   CONTINUED:                                              82 CAROLINE You remind me of a baby bird -- you know those frantic little things with their mouths wide open, wanting, wanting. TOBY Well, at least ask him about my gym shoes again. I can practice barefoot but for games I gotta have shoes. CAROLINE I'm not a referee. I won't do it. 
TOBY Oh, we know, we know: the bride won't argue. The bride won't raise her voice. CAROLINE Well, I'll tell you what    the bride will do: the bride will     get up and walk over there and    slap hell out of the bride's son.     Now does the bride's son want his    face slapped? TOBY Oh, I hate it here! I wish we could just get up and go. CAROLINE I don't have another 'get up and go' left in me! You understand? I'm telling you I've hit a god- damn wall. I can't run anymore. Now this whole thing isn't perfect for me, either... let me impress that on you real strong, okay? I don't wake up singing every morning. But I'm going to make this marriage work -- I won't join in any fights, you got that? I won't even raise my voice! Caroline points to the sink. CAROLINE See those two roses? He picked them for me on his way home last night. (CONTINUED) 
82   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              82 TOBY Big deal. CAROLINE I'm trying to concentrate on the good stuff. Norma appears in the kitchen door, wearing her cap and gown. She strikes a pose. NORMA What d'ya think? I think I look like a fool. (shrugs) Who cares? Six weeks to graduation, and California, here I come! Norma snaps her fingers and goes back to her bedroom. CAROLINE (lamely) Seriously: you have to concentrate on the good stuff. Caroline turns her attention back to the curtains. 
83   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME NIGHT           83 (LATER) "The Lawrence Welk Show" is ON the TELEVISION. Dwight, Caroline, Skipper, Norma and Pearl and Toby watch an Irish tenor sing a lugubrious ballad. Dwight stands in a corner of the room, his saxophone to his lips. He's playing along with the MUSIC, but silently. 
Occasionally he gets overcome and accidentally causes the saxophone to squawk. The Irish ballad ends, and Lawrence Welk's Champagne Orchestra strikes up a lively polka. Dwight takes a sip of his drink and grabs Caroline, pulls her to her feet, and begins to dance with her. A polka can be a decorous, contained dance. He dances Caroline vigorously around the living room, out into the kitchen, around the table, and then back again. Dwight is really good, and Caroline matches him every step of the way. Skipper turns the  VOLUME UP and Dwight kicks the dance into an even higher, wilder gear: The kids clap on the beat, the two whirl and stamp and spin. (CONTINUED) 
83   CONTINUED:                                              83 Faster and faster -- Caroline's heel catches an end table and sends it spinning and faster they go. Caroline's head is thrown back; she's laughing with pleasure. As the MUSIC reaches its CLIMAX, Dwight spins Caroline back to the sofa, lets her go, and WHAM! she lands back where she was seated exactly on the last note of the song. Amid the general laughter and applause, Caroline smiles at Toby. CAROLINE (breathy) Try to find the good stuff, honey. 
84   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON            84 Dwight and Toby face one another in the living room. Both wear their Scout uniforms. Dwight holds a box of chocolate-coated cherries in one hand. TOBY I'm telling you I didn't. DWIGHT And I know damn well you did. TOBY Well, you're wrong. DWIGHT About some things, yeah. Not about this. You're a goddam hog, and I proved it. TOBY How do you know Skipper didn't eat it? Or Norma? Or Pearl? DWIGHT I told all three of them to stay away from this candy for twenty- four hours. TOBY Well, how do you know I even ate any? DWIGHT (a triumphant smile) I counted them. You hogged down eleven chocolate covered cherries since yesterday afternoon. (CONTINUED) 
84   CONTINUED:                                             84 TOBY So what? DWIGHT So that makes you a hog. I just wanted to establish that fact, and now I have. Caroline and Skipper enter, carrying throw pillows and materials. DWIGHT (to Caroline and Skipper) Hey. Mr. Hotshot Hog and I've just been establishing some facts, and what we come up with is this: One, he's a pig who gobbles down everybody's candy; two, he lies about it; three, he lays around on his lazy ass day and night reading, reading; and four, he's not getting any ten-dollar gym shoes. That's about what we've come up with so far. SKIPPER Oh, Dad... DWIGHT (a high, mincing voice) Oh, Dad! Skipper leaves the room. Caroline sits down, begins to try various materials as coverings for the pillows. 
TOBY (to Caroline) Why don't you ever take up for me? DWIGHT (to Caroline) Why don't you ever help me straighten that boy out? Caroline doesn't even look up. She threads a needle and begins to sew. Whilst Dwight paces around the room. DWIGHT All he does is read or listen to records or sing. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
87   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT                               87 Toby and Arthur are eating ice cream cones and smoking cigarettes at the same time. They walk slowly, desultorily. Though still effeminate, Arthur has dropped much of the flounciness that he uses in public. ARTHUR ... Tobias? Your real name is Tobias? Toby... Tobias... I like it -- it's very elegant. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
87   CONTINUED:                                              87 ARTHUR (CONT'D) My real parents would probably have given me an elegant name, too. I say 'real parents' because I suspect I'm a foundling. Somebody royal -- or at least very, very beautiful had me and gave me to my poor but honest mother. (a beat) Tell me more about you. TOBY (shrugs) Every day of my life feels like a mile on the Bataan Death March. 
ARTHUR (laughs) I knew I'd like you. TOBY Why'd you point at me that day? ARTHUR Because you're an alien. You don't belong in Concrete any more than I do. This place would like to kill us because we're different. TOBY Oh, come on, Arthur.   That's a little dramatic. ARTHUR Think so? You know what chickens do if one chicken's born with a little difference? With a few black feathers on its head, say? They peck at the black spot 'til the chicken's dead -- they can't stand the fact that it's different. Now we're both different. Your difference is something other than... (husky-voiced actress) ... my difference... (normal tone) But we're both aliens here. TOBY I don't exactly feel like an alien. I've got friends here. (CONTINUED) 
87   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              87 ARTHUR Yes, and they're fools. And you act like a fool when you're around them. A prediction: if you stay in Concrete, you'll wind up working at the A&P -- either that or you'll go on a rampage with a hunting rifle. TOBY Yeah, and you'll wind up a recluse that everybody says likes to dress up in his mama's old clothes. ARTHUR (laughs) Maybe, maybe, but no matter how many times I have to repeat: my primary goal's to get out of Concrete. TOBY Burma-Shave! Arthur and Toby laugh.   As they walk on, though, Toby's face is thoughtful. 
88   INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT                                 88 Toby and ten other boys are practicing lay-ups. All the boys, Toby included, wear basketball uniforms. All the other boys wear gym shoes. Toby is barefooted. He is however, a smooth, skillful player. 
89   EXT. EDGE OF TOWN - AFTERNOON                                 89 
Toby tosses his last newspaper into a yard, folds his sack, and stands wearily for a few beats. 90   INT. UTILITY PORCH - EARLY EVENING                            90 A large, ugly DOG next to the box of baseball bats and gloves GROWLS and snaps at Toby as he goes past. 
91   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING        91 As Toby enters the room, Norma exits, wearing theatrical makeup and a gypsy costume. Behind her, drink in hand, sits Dwight, wearing a suit and tie, watching the TELEVISION NEWS with the SOUND VERY LOW. TOBY Whose dog is that on the porch? (CONTINUED) 
91   CONTINUED:                                              91 DWIGHT Yours. TOBY Mine? DWIGHT You said you wanted a dog. TOBY A collie, though. Not this one. DWIGHT Well, he's yours. You paid for him. Go get ready for Norma's play. 
95   CONTINUED:                                              95 CAROLINE (calm) Get his rifle back. DWIGHT But that dog's a champion! Caroline calmly SMASHES another PLATE on the countertop. CAROLINE Get his rifle back. DWIGHT Am I supposed to go clear to Seattle just to get... 
Before he finishes the sentence, Caroline SMASHES a GLASS on the countertop. CAROLINE Get his rifle back. DWIGHT Jesus Christ, woman, I don't even know the guy's last name. Caroline picks up a bowl. DWIGHT All right, all right. The guy's supposed to send the A.K.C. papers. When he sends 'em, I'll know his name and address, and I'll go get the god-damn rifle back. Jesus. Caroline exits leaving Dwight, Norma, and Pearl with their mouths open. 
96   EXT. HOUSE - EVENING                                          96 Caroline walks to Toby, sits next to him on the stoop. CAROLINE Well, I did it -- and the bride didn't even raise her voice: he says he'll get the rifle back as soon as the guy who sold him the dog sends the papers. Toby nods.   Caroline looks up at the evening sky and then shrugs. (CONTINUED) 
96   CONTINUED:                                              96 CAROLINE 'Course, having seen that dog, I wouldn't suggest you hang by your thumbs 'til those papers come. I mean, that dog is ugly. Toby gives her a dirty look, but Caroline's smile makes Toby grin. CAROLINE That's nice -- I haven't seen a real smile out of you in a month. TOBY Oh, Mom, can't we leave here? I hate it so much. You don't like it either -- all you do is stick your head in a sewing machine night and day. Let's just leave and start over someplace else. CAROLINE 'Start over.' Do you know how many times I've started over, sweetheart? I don't want to do it anymore. This is as far as I want to go. This place. I have to make this work somehow. We do. You're fourteen now -- you have to help me. TOBY But if... CAROLINE But me no buts, honey. I told you: I've hit a wall. And besides, it's not so bad here, if you just try to -- TOBY If you say 'look for the good stuff,' I'm gonna get Dwight's 30/30 and shoot myself! CAROLINE Seriously, though: give the place a chance. Give him a chance. TOBY Great. Just great. What a life: I gotta live with Dwight... I got a sissy for a new best friend... (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
96   CONTINUED:   (2)                                           96 TOBY (CONT'D) I got no rifle... I got no gym shoes... CAROLINE Well, look on the bright side... You got a dog. In spite of his disappointment over the rifle, in spite of all that Caroline had said about staying with Dwight, Toby is happy to see Caroline completely back to her old self again, joking with him. He grins and, with the palm of his hand, he gives her shoulder a gentle shove. She returns the gesture. And the two of them sit on the steps, staring into the twilight. 
97   INT. ARTHUR GAYLE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY                      97 Arthur is playing the piano. He and Toby sing an old song called "I Wandered Today To the Hill, Maggie." Both of them are enjoying it. As they finish the song, Arthur says a dry "Will you be able to use your musical abilities at the A&P?" Toby laughs and gives him a hard elbow in the ribs. 
98   INT. TOBY'S ROOM - NIGHT                            98 Toby is using a nail clipper over a wastebasket when he hears: DWIGHT (O.S.) Heh Hotshot! He looks up just in time to see a flashlight fly through the air toward him. He catches it. Dwight stands in the doorway. DWIGHT If you can tear yourself away from your pedicure, I want you to fetch me some of that paint from the attic. Dwight switches the room light off. TOBY Yeah. DWIGHT Is now too soon. TOBY God! 
99    INT. DWIGHT'S ATTIC                                           99 Dwight and Toby are looking for something. They both shine flashlights around the dark attic, illuminating old magazines, dolls, etc. Dwight says, "I know I put 'em up here somewhere." Then Toby's flashlight lands on the unusual tub with the four blue stars which had held the beaver. Forgotten all this time, the beaver has transmogrified into a weird, two-foot high pile of what looks like cotton candy. And, hideously enough, the cloud-like stuff is still in the shape of the beaver. Then Dwight says, "Shit -- the roof must've leaked on 'em." Toby turns to where Dwight shines his flashlight on the ten boxes of chestnuts. Also forgotten, the chestnuts are    covered with mold, too -- but a different kind: this     is wet, slick-looking stuff that rises off the chestnuts    like dough in a breadpan. A spasm of rage crosses     Toby's face, and he turns and bangs out of the attic. 
100   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)        100 A drink in one hand, idly fondling Champ's ears with the other, Dwight is watching the NEWS. On the TELEVISION we see a distraught Lana Turner   and her daughter, Cheryl Crane, as the teenaged girl   is led into a tall building.  While we see this, and   then a photograph of a stockily handsome Italian man,   we hear: NEWSCASTER (V.O.) ... Cheryl Crane, daughter of Lana Turner, was held for questioning today in the stabbing death of Johnny Stompanato, Miss Turner's companion. A spokesman for Miss Turner said today that the stabbing was an accident, and that Miss Turner's daughter will not spend even one night in jail for what the spokesman called a 'tragic accident.' Suddenly aware of another presence in   the room, Dwight turns and sees Toby, who is standing   in the doorway, also listening to the NEWSCAST. Toby    is not watching the television, though, he is staring   fixedly at Dwight. Dwight reacts then glances back at the set, where the Stompanato murder story continues. He turns slowly back to Toby, whose eyes are still locked onto his face. The SOUND on the TV FADES. 
107    EXT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S HOUSE - DAWN                     107 Toby silently closes the garage door, the Buick inside and heads for the house. 
107A   SKIPPER AND TOBY'S ROOM - NOON                              107A The clock shows noon. Toby is in bed reading Boy's Life, holding a sandwich and trying to stay awake. Suddenly Dwight appears. Dwight puts his hands into his pockets, leans against the doorway. (CONTINUED) 
107A   CONTINUED:                                                  107A DWIGHT Your mother said you were sick. Feeling better? TOBY Yeah, I am. DWIGHT Good, good.    Get some sleep, did you? TOBY Yeah, I slept about four hours. DWIGHT Must've needed it. A pause: DWIGHT Oh, by the way, you didn't happen to hear a funny pinging noise in the engine, did you? TOBY What engine? DWIGHT I was downtown with Champ a few minutes ago, and I met a guy who recognized him. Said he'd seen my dog this very morning. Told me an interesting story of how he and the dog happened to meet. What d'you think about that? 
TOBY I don't know what you -- Suddenly Dwight is across the floor and onto the bed. He straddles Toby and slaps him across the face with the left hand then the right, again and again. Toby holds a forearm protectively across his face. Dwight holds both Toby's hands with one of his and, slaps the boy's face again and again. Finally Toby manages to get his right hand loose.      He slams his forearm across Dwight's throat. Dwight rears back, choking and gagging. Toby throws off the covers and tries to run. Still choking, Dwight grabs the back of Toby's hair and forces the boy's face down against the mattress. (CONTINUED)

Dwight stumbles up gasping for breath. DWIGHT Only me. On this whole earth, to straighten you out. And I will do it kill or cure. Now get your ass up -- you're going to school. 
108    EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - NOON                                        108 A BELL RINGS as Dwight's BUICK SCREECHES to a stop and Toby gets out. As he heads toward the doors. Toby then turns to stare at Dwight's car. They lock eyes, then Dwight smirks and pulls away. Toby watches the car disappear, then spins around and walks into the school. FADE OUT. FADE UP TO: 108A   SAME SCENE - AFTERNOON                                         108A The CAMERA is in the EXACT SAME SPOT. The school seems a bit seedier, and two newly-planted saplings established in the previous scene are both eight feet taller, with wide spreading branches. Students pour out    the door. Among them Toby, taller and a bit heavier, he    now wears black leather boots, and a pack of cigarettes    rolled into the sleeve of his T-shirt. His hair is still    pure Elvis. 
Toby comes back out the door with four very different friends. CHUCK BOLGER, the most reasonable-looking of Toby's companions, is the son of a minister. A second boy, known as PSYCHO, is a hulking boy with a tendency toward sadism. JERRY HUFF is handsome in a pouty, heavy- lidded way. His Elvis pompadour is even higher than Toby's. ARCH COOK is an amiable simpleton who sometimes talks to himself or laughs for no reason. Toby and his four friends pile into Chuck Bolger's '53 CHEVY, and they PEEL OUT. 
109    INT. CHUCK BOLGER'S CAR - NOON                                 109 As the car barrels through downtown Concrete, we see a movie marquee reading... (CONTINUED) 
109   CONTINUED:                                              109 ... The Apartment, and a five foot poster that says, "ELECT JOHN KENNEDY, 1960." In the back seat, Psycho pours vodka into a half empty can of Hawaiian punch, then takes a huge swig. PSYCHO (screams it) Ag-Hhh! Gorilla blood. JERRY Oh, Psycho, shut up. CHUCK (pointing) Oh, look -- there goes Carol Baumgarten. Ain't she sweet? She's hot for Wolff. TOBY I wish. CHUCK Won't do her any good, though -- Jack's saving himself for Rhea Clark. TOBY Knock it off. JERRY You know what he said about Rhea? Said even the inside of her arm turned him on. You slay me, Wolff. She is pretty though. 
There is a brief silence. Suddenly Caroline leans across the table and speaks to Dwight in a loud, exaggerated disappointed whine: CAROLINE Oh, Rickyyy! (louder; same whine) Oh, Ricky-y-y! Please let me come down and work at the club! DWIGHT What the hell are you doing? CAROLINE Well, you treat me like Lucy, I'll act like her. I'll be working for Kennedy's campaign. 
114   INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME NIGHT (LATER)                       114 
The four of them are watching "The Untouchables." We watch as a frightened man speaks to Al Capone, who sits behind a large desk. FRIGHTENED MAN (V.O.) (on T.V.) ... please, Mr. Capone, it'll never happen again, I swear it. It was an accident. I can promise you faithfully it won't be repeated. Finally Al Capone speaks.   He leans across his desk, bugs out his eyes, and hisses: (CONTINUED) 
114   CONTINUED:                                               114 AL CAPONE (V.O.) (on T.V.) Why don't you take a little ride with Frank? The man's eyes bulge with fear, and he cries, "No!    No!" as two men escort him out the door. In the next shot we see a long black car parked on a country road, and we hear a SHOT. 
115   INT. BATHROOM - SAME NIGHT (LATER)                             115 Toby is brushing his teeth when Dwight enters. 
TOBY I'll be through in a minute. Dwight looks around. DWIGHT You left the lid off the damn toothpaste again. TOBY (not looking at him) Oh, Dwight, is that the best you can come up with? Angered, but keeping his voice low.   He pushes Toby's shoulder. DWIGHT This is my bathroom, and I say about the toothpaste, got it? (pushes again) Huh? Have you? Huh? Now if you lived with your daddy Duke and his rich wife, maybe things'd be different, but he's not here now, is he? (high, flutey voice) Oh, Duke? Duke, are you here? Dukie? Oh, how sad -- Duke's not here. Oh, boo hoo! (normal voice) My bathroom. I get to say. Got that? Still Toby doesn't respond -- Dwight reaches out and pinches the skin on Toby's waist, hard. Toby still doesn't respond, when Dwight begins to twist it. Toby spins around, eyes blazing. (CONTINUED) 
115   CONTINUED:                                              115 DWIGHT Come on. Oh, come on.     Give me an excuse. Toby hesitates, then leaves the bathroom, humiliated. 
116   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                          116 Toby exits the bathroom, then sees Caroline in a doorway. She's heard it all. They look intently at each other. Toby nods and walks on down the hall. 
117   INT. TOBY'S ROOM - INSTANTS LATER                             117 
120   CONTINUED:                                                  120 ARCH Nobody in your family ever even been in a Corvette, let alone owned one. CHUCK You wait and see if I don't get one. I'm gonna move down to Seattle, get a job at Bendix and drive a 'Vette to work every day. JERRY My uncle can have any car he wants. He makes big bucks as an electrician. 
ARCH Yeah?   How big? JERRY Hundred seventy-five a week, take home. PSYCHO Bullshitter! JERRY Fuck you, it's true. CHUCK Even the supervisors at Bendix don't make that. JERRY So how are you ever gonna make enough to drive a 'Vette then, fuck-face? The others all laugh at Chuck. Toby has reached the group and stands on the lip of the large wooden platform that they are on and listens while leaning on a large hook. PSYCHO I'm gonna drive a T-bird, someday. CHUCK An' I'm gonna own a Corvette if I have to hold up the Bendix payroll to get it. JERRY Fuck you. (CONTINUED) 
120   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                120 ARCH Me. I want to eat a big red-haired pussy. The others all laugh at him.     Toby regards them with a sneer. TOBY Losers.   What a bunch of losers. CHUCK Who you calling a loser, fuck-face? TOBY All of you. (to Chuck) You're gonna drive a Fairlane just like your daddy does. (to Psycho) How you ever going to drive a Thunderbird when you're a janitor like the rest of your family? (to Jerry) An' you can forget being an electrician, you can't even pass tenth grade math. JERRY Well fuck you.     Who died an' made you King Shit? PSYCHO Yeah, you're no better than us. TOBY I know that, Psycho. That's my point: Ha, ha, ha. You guys are my buddies. You guys are my pals. And my dear old dad's called Dwight. (he spreads his arms wide) Welcome to Concreeee... Toby topples over and falls down a bank of rubble. The other burst out laughing and hooting. The CAMERA MOVES off them and CRANES DOWN to a spread-eagled Toby's face. The LAUGHTER ECHOES around the building. Toby begins to laugh, but it soon turns to bitter tears. DISSOLVE TO:

122   INT. KENNEDY CAMPAIGN OFFICE - DAY                         122 Toby enters the small office where Caroline is running hundreds of flyers on a duplicating machine. Surprised she sees Toby's expression. CAROLINE What is it? TOBY I called Gregory at Princeton. (as Caroline reacts) He's sending me applications for prep schools. I need you to take me to Seattle to take some entrance exams. 
CAROLINE Would a prep school take you with, uh, your school record? TOBY I've got to get out of here, Mom. I've got to. I've got to get away. CAROLINE When are the tests? TOBY Saturday. CAROLINE You'll be there. TOBY He won't let you have the Buick. 
CAROLINE You'll be there! 
123   EXT. LAKESIDE SCHOOL IN SEATTLE - DAY                      123 Graceful buildings, green lawns, a CARILLON CHIMING. Toby walks toward a large building. 
124   INT./EXT. TESTING ROOM - DAY                               124 Twenty-three boys and Toby stand waiting restlessly for the tests to begin. Toby looks very different from the other intelligent looking, well-bred boys in his Elvis hairdo. 
131   INT. SCHOOL WORKSHOP - DAY                                   131 Toby is working with a table saw. Suddenly a two-inch- thick manilla envelope plops down beside him. He looks up to see Arthur standing beside him. Glancing around to see that he's unobserved, he checks the contents of the envelope: we see school stationery, blank transcript forms, and a stack of official envelopes. Toby closes his eyes. He's saved. (CONTINUED) 
131   CONTINUED:                                                  131 TOBY You could leave too, you know. ARTHUR No, I've grown progressively fond of Concrete. I think I'll stay here all alone and dress up in my mama's old clothes sometimes -- like you said. Arthur turns and    swishes away. Toby pats   the manilla envelope, turns    back to the saw. Suddenly   he jerks, looks down, and    sees that the ring finger  of his left hand is spurting    blood. Toby says a mild,   astonished "Hey," and sinks    to his knees. 
132   INT. TYPING LAB - SAME DAY (AFTERNOON)                            132 With his hand bandaged Toby sits at a typewriter with a blank transcript. He carefully types "TOBIAS WOLFF." Then, he begins to type the letter "A" in every slot for grades. 
133   EXT. STREET - EVENING                                             133 Toby mails five letters. 
134   INT. TOBY'S BEDROOM - DAY                                         134 Toby lies in bed reading the paper. He still holds his hand in the air (the white bandage is now dingy). 
Caroline appears in the doorway. CAROLINE Come help me stuff envelopes. TOBY I'll do some this afternoon. CAROLINE No, I need to take them with me. TOBY I'll be in in a minute.    Let me finish this article. (CONTINUED) 
134   CONTINUED:                                              134 CAROLINE Boy, you irritate me. (new tone) I think maybe you ought to... Yeah -- I think maybe you should just... (hisses) ... TAKE A LITTLE RIDE WITH DWIGHT. Toby laughs, and gets up to help her. 
135   EXT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING              135 
Toby starts up the sideway, Pearl exits the house with several letters in her hand. PEARL 'You got letters from those schools!' Toby grabs them as if they were the very stuff of life. Pearl stands expectantly. Toby notices her, then walks off holding the letters to his chest. 
Exasperated that conversation is continuing when he's trying to listen, Dwight reaches over, presses his hand down on the arm of the record player, then SCRAPES it back and forth on the record. It's a violent action, and it makes a GROTESQUE SOUND. The NEEDLE BOUNCES around on the scarred record. As the three of them stare at him, Dwight speaks calmly: DWIGHT I was trying to listen to a record. Dwight rises, walks outside into the back yard. Then the TELEPHONE RINGS. Pearl answers it, listens, then says, PEARL "Yeah, he's here," She holds the receiver out to Toby, whispering, "Are you Tobias?" 
TOBY Hello? All right.     Tomorrow, then. Goodbye. Toby hangs up, turns to Caroline, quietly: TOBY It's Hill School -- the last one I applied to. They haven't accepted me, but they're sending somebody up to interview me. Caroline upsets the puzzle getting up to hug Toby. 
141   INT. DRUGSTORE - AFTERNOON                                  141 Toby is sitting in a booth with MR. HOWARD, a man in his late thirties. Toby has made a real attempt to look good.    His hair is modified, and he wears a tie and a suit. TOBY ... Yeah, I enjoy my classes, especially the ones that are advanced, but I've been feeling a little restless lately. It's hard to explain. MR. HOWARD Well, you're probably bored. Not being challenged. Your application was very good, Toby, but we have many boys who want to go to Hill. Not everybody is comfortable at a prep school. TOBY I think I would be. My father and brother went to prep schools. MR. HOWARD Is that right?     Where? TOBY Deerfield and Choate. Mr. Howard is impressed. MR. HOWARD I see. Well, maybe you'd like it. Hill was difficult for me, though -- classes were hard, and the boys seemed cold -- interested in money and social position. (laughs) And I hated those snowy Pennsylvania winters! But then in my last year, something changed. The guys in my class grew close, so close that I still think of them as a second family. TOBY (honest) I want that. I do, and -- (CONTINUED) 
141   CONTINUED:                                              141 He stops    talking as we hear, O.S., "AG-H-H-H!" Psycho and Arch have    entered the drugstore. Toby's back is to the door, and    he slouches deeper into the booth, praying that he won't    be seen. Arch and Psycho buy cigarettes. ARCH ... so she said, 'No, I don't want you to do that,' and I said 'Oh, baby, let me get down and grovel on it.' I mean, I ate her pussy 'til my tongue was calloused, and then... 
Arch moves toward the    back of the store toward the area where Toby sits. Toby     inches down a bit farther into the booth. Arch stops at     a sunglass rack five feet from Toby and tries on a couple    of pairs. ARCH ... so anyway, she went off like a Roman candle -- I mean that woman can scream. I said, 'You liked that, didn't you, baby?' I said, 'You liked the old Arch Cook special, didn't you?' Arch decides to let the sunglasses go. He and Psycho move toward the front of the store, he talks about pussy. Toby exhales. MR. HOWARD Toby, boys at Hill talk roughly sometimes too -- you'd have to be ready for that. I can see you've had sort of a sheltered life. Toby nods his head. 
142   EXT. DRUGSTORE - AFTERNOON                                    142 Mr. Howard shakes Toby's hand. MR. HOWARD You seem like a fine boy, and I'll give you a good report tomorrow. But there are lots of boys applying, and we'll just have to wait and see whether -- From O.S., we hear Dwight's voice, and Toby goes rigid. (CONTINUED) 
142   CONTINUED:                                              142 DWIGHT (O.S.) Ohh, it's the Hotshot Boy. Both Mr. Howard and Toby turn to see Dwight, wearing his coveralls, ten feet away. DWIGHT Yeah, it's the guy who thinks he knows everything. Thinks he's so smart, but fella, what you don't know would fill a book. (glances at Mr. Howard's new Chevrolet; offhand) General Motors makes shit cars. 
Dwight turns and enters the drugstore. TOBY (weakly) That's, uh, that's this guy... he's a mechanic... did some bad work on our car... It's not much of an explanation, but Mr. Howard seems to buy it. He says goodbye to Toby, gets into his car, drives away. Toby stares after him. DISSOLVE TO: 
143   INT. A & P GROCERY STORE - NIGHT                              143 A few weeks have passed. Toby (his Elvis hairdo further modified) again prices and stacks food. His face is serious, his manner industrious.

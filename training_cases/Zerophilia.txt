FADE IN: 
EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT 
Mist. Dark trees.     Dripping vines.        An ENGINE RUMBLES in the distance. 
The full moon shimmers on a puddle.          A FROG SPLATS IN, splashing a one man pup tent. 
INSIDE THE TENT 
LUKE's eyes pop open, disoriented, realizing he's fallen asleep reading by flashlight. He's nineteen, still slightly awkward and unaware he's growing handsome. 
He listens as the ENGINE RUMBLES LOUDER, closer. 
He peers out through the tent flap. Glaring head lamps ROAR toward him. Scrambling out of his sleeping bag, he HURLS himself against the side of the tent, as... 
OUTSIDE 
an RV CAMPER nearly plows down the tent, skidding to a stop in the mud. 
Stillness. 
Luke extricates himself from the tent.          He runs to the driver- side window of the RV. 
LUKE Are you all right? 
Inside, ALEXA, thirties, earthy, looks up at him bleary-eyed. She nods 'yes.' 
LUKE (CONT'D) How did you even get here?       There's no road. 
ALEXA I'm sorry.     I'm from Utah. 
LUKE It's okay. 
ALEXA Are you alone out here? 
He nods 'yes.'    She bursts into TEARS. 
ALEXA (CONT'D) My husband. Bastard. I've been driving for days. I don't even know where I'm going. 
LUKE Oh, wow.    I'm really sorry. 
She gathers herself, sniffling. 
I have warm apple kringel in the camper. Would you like some? 
LUKE Uh, what is it? 
ALEXA Pastry. 
INSIDE RV CAMPER 
Luke stands at the RV's tiny kitchen counter, wolfing pastry off a paper plate. 
ALEXA So, this "Survival Quest" is your vacation? 
LUKE Yeah. It's my third try.     Kind a' lame, huh? 
ALEXA No. Seven days alone in the wilderness?   I'd be afraid. 
LUKE It's just something I really wanted to do. 
Luke notices an odd pile of stuff by the sink. 
ALEXA His shoes. Fishing lures.        The electric drill. 
As he glances out the driver-side window, MUSIC BLARES from the passing car. 
INSIDE THE CAR 
A glimpse of what might be an ORGY of BODIES intertwined. 
The FEMALE DRIVER - GRINS MANIACALLY UP at Luke as the CAR HORN SCREAMS by. 
Luke CAREENS to one side, glancing at the truck's 
LEFT SIDE VIEW MIRROR 
The car recedes in the distance, but the Female Driver appears CLOSE in the mirror's reflection, LEERING. She LICKS THE MIRROR from the inside, and disappears. 
THROUGH THE TRUCK WINDSHIELD 
Luke stares out, EYES GLAZED. 
INT. KEENAN AND LUKE'S GARAGE 
The decrepit old garage looks as if it may collapse any second. Barbells on the floor. Luke dodges and weaves, slugging a makeshift punching bag. 
Keenan appears, wiping sleep from his eyes. 
KEENAN We takin' up boxing? 
LUKE I don't know. I am. 
KEENAN What's goin' on? You competin' for Mr. Universe this week? 
LUKE Everyone should just mind their own fucking business! 
Keenan recoils at the attitude. 
KEENAN Didn't go so great, huh? 
Luke punches the bag, harder and faster, a near SEIZURE: ROAD RAGE. 
He collapses in a heap. 
KEENAN (CONT'D) Dude. 
LUKE It was goin' great. She's amazing. Funny. And really smart.    And the way she eats ravioli, like 'aah.' 
KEENAN Cool. 
LUKE Then I started feelin' all weird again, and,... oh, man, you'll think I'm nuts... Keen, I had breasts. I felt 'em. 
KEENAN Whoa, first date.     Definitely the 'new Luke!' 
LUKE No!     On me. 
KEENAN You're startin' to creep me out. Listen, I think I know what's goin' on, okay? "Acute Adolescent Anxiety." It's from the stress of college, girls, grades. It's really common. 
LUKE I'm not an adolescent.    Where'd you get this crap?! 
KEENAN The Net. I found all the symptoms right off: panic attacks, "Localized Alopecia" -that's hair loss. This doctor wrote back, "Any chance your friend, Luke, just lost his virginity?" 
LUKE You told, -you gave him my name?! 
KEENAN He's a doctor, back East. He's sending this information pack. Look, I started thinkin' you're goin' bipolar on me or somethin'. Come on, man, BREASTS?! 
Luke considers. 
EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING Luke hops down from the truck cab, fixes his shirt and hair, trying to look nonchalant as he rings the doorbell. 
Hearing something behind him, he turns as Max PUNCHES him in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him. 
MAX You son-of-a-bitch, stay the hell away from my sister! 
Luke GASPS for air. 
MAX (CONT'D) You don't say a word?! You just leave her sittin' there?! 
SYDNEY Sometimes you guys are just unfathomably stupid. 
LUKE Excuse me? 
SYDNEY Why in the world do guys say "it sucks" as if it were a bad thing? I mean, every guy's dying to get a blow job, right? So, you think they'd treat those words with profound respect, like holy scripture. "What an unbelievable sunset, honey: doesn't it just SUCK?,"... "You won an Olympic Gold Medal?!, that BLOWS!" 
LUKE I guess you're right. 
SYDNEY It must be great at your age. That river of testosterone coursing through your veins, the damn about to burst! How about we just lock this place up and go for an Olympic Gold? 
LUKE No thanks.     Jeez, lady. 
Disappointed, she checks her reflection in the freezer door. 
SYDNEY I ought to dye my hair.      Don't you think? 
LUKE Uh, I don't know.    Looks fine. 
SYDNEY Your hair is such an incredible color. 
LUKE It's brown. 
SYDNEY I love it. Do you think I could cut just a little piece? Match the color? It really "sucks." 
LUKE Nah, c'mon. You're messin' with me. 
SYDNEY I'm not. I love it. You really should get rid a' that thing, anyway. I have clippers in my bag. 
LUKE What thing? 
SYDNEY Cowlick. Right here.     See?   I can just snip it off. 
She SNIPS his hair.    Luke pulls away. 
LUKE Hey. 
SYDNEY What's the matter? Don't you like being touched? Don't you like being a guy? 
LUKE No. I mean,... What?      Sorry, but you're just bizarre. 
She CHUCKLES, lays money on the counter. 
SYDNEY May be. But I learned long ago, you can't change your true nature, even if it can change you. 
As she leaves, she takes a provocative bite of the popsicle. 
EXT. POLLY WOG'S POOL HALL - DUSK 
Acres of yellowing corn surround a dilapidated farmhouse converted into a pool hall. The windows glow from warm lights inside. 
Parked along the gravel driveway are pickup trucks, cars, and Luke's Semi. 
INSIDE POOL HALL 
Smoke, ROWDY MUSIC and the CLACK of cue balls. 
Keenan and Luke snake their way through the pool tables. 
LUKE Holy shit. It's that lady from the store! Grey and black at the bar. 
Keenan looks over at Sydney, finishing off a bourbon. 
RENTAL COUNTER 
Janine and Michelle check out a rack of billiard balls from the worldly British owner, POLLY. 
She runs the place like a wild west saloon, with such ease and confidence, it suggests there may be a shotgun under the bar. 
POLLY That boy, Keenan, still giving you trouble? 
JANINE Actually, I tried exactly what you said. 
POLLY And...? 
KEENAN What're you talkin' about? 
SYDNEY Chromosomes. Most people have forty-six: Two X if you're a girl, an X and Y if you're a guy. He's got forty seven: An X, a Y, and a Z. 
POOL TABLE 
Janine and Michelle select pool cues. 
JANINE We've only been together six months. And he's such a guy's guy, everyone's buddy, but, alcoholic parents, six months in "Juvey." 
MICHELLE Wild past, huh? 
JANINE I think the only reason he's even alive right now, is okay, partly 'cause he's so damn smart, but mostly 'cause there's this one person, he knows, absolutely, no matter what, won't bale on him. 
MICHELLE You. 
JANINE No. He doesn't trust me at all. Luke. He's a rock. 
MICHELLE Yeah? 
JANINE So, yes, you can trust him. I'm hoping Keenan's the same way. 'Cause believe me, I'm not used to rocks, I'm used to pebbles. 
Michelle LAUGHS. 
MICHELLE Grains of sand. 
Luke rejoins them with the pitcher of beer, glancing back toward the bar. Keenan comes too, with a look of concern. 
JANINE Everything okay? 
KEENAN Sure.   I need a drink. 
Keenan steals glances at Luke, trying to sort it all out. 
KEENAN (CONT'D) (aside to Luke) That lady's nuts. 
Luke nods. 
AT THE BAR 
Sydney sits at a bar stool, keeping an eye on Luke and Michelle. Jeremy lays out a cocktail napkin, speaks with a slight Texas drawl. 
JEREMY Another round? 
SYDNEY Please. You see that couple over there? I don't get it. What's he see in her? 
JEREMY The brunette? You kiddin'? I'd give my left one to be with her. 
SYDNEY Yeah?   So could he. 
POOL TABLE - LATER 
Now alone with Michelle, Luke lines up his cue stick, then catches Michelle's admiring eyes. 
She smiles, glances over at Keenan and Janine, making out by the jukebox. 
MICHELLE Your friends sorta' like each other, huh? 
LUKE Super-glue. Thirty seconds together, you can't pull 'em apart. 
MICHELLE How'd they meet? 
LUKE Keenan sold her a bike. I don't think they've been apart more than six hours since. 
Luke peers over the corner pocket, and watches Michelle shoot and sink the ball. 
LUKE (CONT'D) I never thought in a million years you'd go out with me, let alone twice. 
MICHELLE You're not s'posed to say that. That's a total pathetic, loser thing to say. But I'm gonna' take it as a huge compliment. 
MICHELLE (CONT'D) Okay, two word answers only. Why'd you ask me out in the first place? 
LUKE Beautiful. Unpretentious.     Why'd you say 'yes?' 
MICHELLE God.    Sorry. 
Luke picks the cue ball up off the floor and sets it on the table. 
He sees them watching him. 
LUKE What? 
KEENAN Man, I'd be on the floor cryin' like a baby. 
LUKE No, I'm all right. 
Surprised, they return to the game. 
Michelle lines up the cue ball again, as Luke considers,... 
with a slow-dawning realization that something, somehow, just isn't right. 
He casually touches his hand to his pants. 
He pales slightly. 
LUKE (CONT'D) Would you excuse me a sec'? 
He looks to Keenan for help. 
AT THE BAR 
Sydney watches as Keenan and Luke cross the hall toward the back. 
She flags Jeremy. 
SYDNEY Jeremy! Bourbon. Fast! (a glance at Luke) Better give me the whole bottle. 
OUTSIDE MEN'S ROOM 
Luke tries the men's room door, locked. 
KEENAN In here. 
Keenan opens another door that leads them into a store room. Luke follows, with a look of concern. 
INSIDE STORE ROOM 
KEENAN (CONT'D) I mean, it was like a precision- guided missile. 
Luke unzips and gently digs in his trousers. 
He looks down, SHUDDERS,... 
LUKE Uh- ah- 
Luke's face CONTORTS, terrified. 
KEENAN I'll get some ice. 
Luke shakes his head "no," points toward his crotch, GASPS, barely able to make a sound... 
LUKE It's-!     Look! 
Keenan gives him a look, repelled, perplexed... 
KEENAN What? 
then takes a look,... 
His EYES GET HUGE. 
KEENAN (CONT'D) DUDE!!! 
Sydney BURSTS in with the bottle of bourbon. 
SYDNEY I was afraid a' this! (to Keenan) Make sure no one gets in! 
INT. SYDNEY'S BED & BREAKFAST - LATE NIGHT 
On a corner table sits high-tech laboratory equipment. 
Keenan and Luke gulp beers, still in shock.   Luke keeps one hand down his pants for reassurance. 
SYDNEY In the world?   A hundred. A thousand. There's no way to know. It doesn't show up in any normal DNA test. It's triggered when you first have sex. 
LUKE The woman in the RV! 
KEENAN (dark) From Utah. 
SYDNEY Now, you're Morphescent whenever you're aroused. 
KEENAN You tellin' me this is gonna' happen any time he gets the hots for a girl? 
Keenan looks over at Luke... 
KEENAN (CONT'D) Man, this could be a problem. 
LUKE Is there a cure? 
SYDNEY It's not a disease!    But there are steps you can take. 
LUKE Well, what are they? 
SYDNEY Take it easy. You can't rush this. Before anything, you need to try going all the way. 
KEENAN "All the way?" 
SYDNEY You need to turn all the way into a female. 
LUKE You out of your mind?! 
SYDNEY You have to give it a try. 
KEENAN Maybe we should get a second opinion. 
LUKE Yeah, may be! 'Cause you can FORGET THAT! 
SYDNEY Fine, but I warn you, they've never seen this before. First, they'll try a barrage of antipsychotic medications, surgery, electroshock therapy, -god knows what. 
KEENAN If he were to try goin' all the way, then what? 
Luke glares at him. 
KEENAN (CONT'D) I'm just askin'. 
LUKE It ain't gonna' happen! 
SYDNEY Oh, for Chris' sake! I'm trying to help you. That Z chromosome's not latent anymore! You don't get control a' that thing, you don't know when it's going to kick in, what it's gonna' do! You want to end up with three left breasts, behemoth hips and one testicle?! 
Luke and Keenan swallow, wide-eyed at the prospect. 
Sydney calms herself down. 
SYDNEY (CONT'D) Now, there's no reason for that to happen. Sorry. You're not the only one who didn't get any sleep. Now, are you going to let me help, or not? 
KEENAN How would he even do that?   Go all the way, I mean? 
SYDNEY He's a Z. (to Luke) You become Morphescent when you get turned on. You can change all the way when you have an orgasm. 
LUKE With who? 
SYDNEY I'm available. 
LUKE No way! 
SYDNEY Well, excuse me. Truth is, at this stage, you don't really need anyone else. 
LUKE Huh? 
Sydney wearily sips a highball. She looks to Keenan for help. Keenan flashes the international sign for jacking off. 
JANINE C'mon, Michelle. Let the boys play with their pucks. 
BEHIND STACKS OF LUMBER 
Luke leans against the logs, wipes sweat from his brow, and realizes... 
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING AGAIN. 
Panicked, he grabs his crotch, feels it, 
Everything's normal. 
Or is it? 
He frantically unbuttons his shirt and peers inside,... 
He slumps back against the logs, 
WAVES OF RELIEF. 
INT. LUKE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Luke storms through the house, trying to evade Janine, who enthusiastically follows. Keenan traipses after. 
LUKE You TOLD HER?! 
KEENAN I had to. You know Janine.   She knew somethin' was up. 
JANINE I've read about this kinda' thing, but I didn't think it was real. It's so cool! 
LUKE It's disgusting! 
JANINE How can you say that? If I had a chance to be a guy for a day, I'd jump at it. Seriously, Keen, wouldn't you want to get inside a girl's body? 
Realizing she just handed him the perfect straight line... 
JANINE (CONT'D) Don't EVEN go there! (rolling her eyes) Fine. You're boys. Still, isn't it every guy's dream to have a pair of boobs to play with anytime he wants? 
LUKE Not my own! (to Keenan) Man, how could you tell her?! 
KEENAN She should be here. It's just weird, two guys alone, one turnin' into a girl. 
JANINE Yeah, I can't wait. Not exactly something you get to see every day. 
LUKE Forget it! 
JANINE What, HE gets to, and I don't! 
LUKE No one gets to! 
Luke goes in the bedroom, SLAMS the door. 
Keenan and Janine take up residence outside. 
Janine tries to peek through the keyhole, beneath the door. 
JANINE Should we put on some soft music? 
KEENAN You want a magazine in there? 
LUKE (O.S.) Shut up! 
LATER 
Janine keeps an ear held close against the door. 
KEENAN How 'bout a couple beers? 
JANINE Maybe you want to take a bath? 
LUKE (O.S.) Will you PLEASE shut up?! 
JANINE Does he sound different? 
Female Luke can't stop gazing at herself in the mirror. 
FEMALE LUKE This is too weird. This is freaking me out. 
KEENAN Should we call Dr. Catchadourian? 
FEMALE LUKE What for? I did it. Now, I can switch back. Get outta' here. 
JANINE Already? 
KEENAN Yeah, okay, yeah. 
JANINE Will you stop starin'?! 
Janine rolls her eyes, as she and Keenan back out of the room, their eyes locked on her amazing body. 
OUTSIDE BEDROOM - LATER 
Janine and Keenan are sprawled on the nearby couch. 
Luca opens the door. 
FEMALE LUKE Janine? It's like I can't get in the right mood or something. 
JANINE Welcome to my world. Oh, honey, no one could in this situation. 
FEMALE LUKE You gotta' help. I need to do this right now! 
JANINE You can't force these things. 
KEENAN Some girls go half their lives before they even have one. 
JANINE Okay, Studly, what do you suggest? 
KEENAN She likes it when I tell her stuff. 
JANINE Like what? 
KEENAN "You're so beautiful," "I love your smile," "The English Patient was my favorite movie too." 
Janine and Female Luke both roll their eyes.       Female Luke swings the door shut. 
The DOORBELL CHIMES. 
FEMALE LUKE (O.S.) Who's that?! 
KEENAN Pizza!   Figured you'll want some after. 
FRONT DOOR 
Janine throws it open, Max stands outside. 
MAX Hey. 
JANINE Can I help you? 
MAX I was lookin' for Luke. 
KEENAN Hey, man. He's not around right now. What's up? 
Female Luke comes out of the bedroom, wrapped in a sheet. 
FEMALE LUKE Thank God.     I'm starving! 
She stops in her tracks, stares at Max. 
Max stares back, intrigued. 
MAX How ya' doin'? 
Female Luke nods 'okay.' 
MAX (CONT'D) I'm Max.    You live here too? 
JANINE (shrugs) He's a hunk. 
LUCA I got to switch back.    Right now! 
JANINE What's the big deal? 
LUCA Get out of here!     Just GET OUT! 
JANINE Okay, okay. 
OUTSIDE BEDROOM 
Janine emerges from the bedroom to join Keenan.    He looks up at her, questioning. 
KEENAN What's goin' on? 
JANINE It's a girl thing. 
KEENAN Does he need any help in there? 
JANINE Not from you. 
OUTSIDE BEDROOM DOOR - LATER 
Keenan and Janine sprawled out, leaning against the door, half-eaten pizza between them on the floor, WEARY. 
BUZZING emanates from inside the bedroom. 
LUCA (O.S.) This is good! 
Keenan and Janine PERK UP. 
KEENAN Finally. 
JANINE Alright, okay, now open those little levers on the sides,... and flip that center thingy back... 
Keenan finds this particularly unsettling. 
LUCA (O.S.) (enthused) Did you get this thing at the mall? 
JANINE No. 
KEENAN Janine wouldn't have one a' those. 
JANINE Please. And mine's got way more features than that one. (Keenan's crotch) Or that one. 
Keenan gives her the evil eye. 
LUCA (O.S.) So, where'd you get it? 
JANINE It was Larissa's.    My roommate. 
Inside the bedroom, the BUZZING STOPS. 
LUCA (O.S.) GROSSS!!! 
OUTSIDE DOOR 
Keenan grabs the last bottle from his six-pack. 
KEENAN I'm just sayin', he's not that experienced with girls. 
JANINE Oh, and you are? 
KEENAN I'm startin' to wonder if you are? 
JANINE I'm not gonna' feed your fantasies. 
Keenan flips the TV remote, disturbed. 
INSIDE THE BEDROOM 
Luca sits on the edge of the bed, frustrated. 
Sydney smiles, nods in agreement. 
SYDNEY A lot of guys could use one of those. 
LUKE So, what now? Do I take pills or something? 
SYDNEY No, it doesn't work like that. This may sound odd, but I need to know if you're attracted to me. 
LUKE What?    No. 
SYDNEY Hmm.    You're not gay, are you? 
LUKE NO! Jeez! I'm just not attracted to you like that. 
SYDNEY Okay, calm down. This could be a problem. Right now, you can go either way anytime you want. It's a very special and critical time for a Z, something you'll experience only once in life. 
LUKE Good. 
SYDNEY You need to use this incredible opportunity you've been given, to figure out which you're supposed to be: male or female. 
LUKE What? 
SYDNEY Don't you see? You get to choose. 
LUKE I don't want to choose.   I want to be a guy. 
SYDNEY Yes, well, the thing is, sometimes your desires can conflict with your desires. It's important to know for sure. 
LUKE Believe me, I know. 
SYDNEY I think you need to try again. 
LUKE No way! 
SYDNEY Why're you so resistant? If the truth is, you want to be a guy, great, but if not... 
LUKE Don't even say that! 
SYDNEY Well, clearly some part of you feels differently. You couldn't change if you didn't want to. 
LUKE What?!    That's crap! 
SYDNEY That's the thing about the truth. It'll set you free, but first it can really piss you off. 
Sydney moves to leave. 
LUKE This is nuts! I'm supposed to be a guy! 
SYDNEY Then what's the problem?   You are one. 
Sydney turns to leave. 
LUKE You're not gonna' help?! 
SYDNEY I will, the moment you're ready to try again. You can come back to my place right now if you want. 
LUKE Forget it! 
EXT. LUMBER MILL - DAY 
Bikes and SUV's outside the shut down mill.    Abandoned timber surrounds an asphalt clearing. 
Luke, Keenan, Chad, Jeremy, and OTHER GUYS in the midst of a friendly, if brutal roller hockey game. 
Luke glances over and spots Max high up on a pile of logs, cheering them on. 
Jeremy passes the puck off to Luke who drives it MANIACALLY to score the winning GOAL. 
The Guys CHEER. 
CHAD Well, ain't we a basket a' biscuits? 
JEREMY Yeah, Luke, what got into you today? 
Luke breaks free of the guys, and moves off. 
INT. POLLY WOG'S POOL HALL - DAWN 
Sydney stands at the bar with a cup of coffee, chatting with Jeremy. 
JEREMY This shirt? I've had it for years. 
SYDNEY Well, it's very sexy. I love men's clothes. What else have you got in your closet? 
Jeremy smiles, unsure what she means. When Polly approaches, her eyes a little red, Jeremy pulls her aside. 
JEREMY Polly, are you alright?   Didn't mean to walk in on you. 
POLLY Oh, hon. I'm fine, thanks. Love, tears. That's the trade-off. 
She puts a hand to his cheek, reassuring.    Jeremy ducks behind the bar. 
SYDNEY My God, he's gorgeous. 
POLLY Yes, he's a Michelangelo. And the sweetest boy in the world. Sorry, darling, I'm afraid you'll find he's not your type. 
SYDNEY Oh, we'll see about that. 
POLLY I think he may prefer men. 
SYDNEY I certainly hope so. 
Keenan and Janine enter. 
SYDNEY (CONT'D) You two better have a seat. 
JANINE Is Luke alright? 
SYDNEY He should have full control over this now. Something must be really confusing him. The only thing I can think of... 
KEENAN What? 
SYDNEY When he became Luca, was he attracted to one of you? You can get really thrown by that. Janine? 
JANINE No.   Not me. 
KEENAN Well, he sure as hell wasn't attracted to me. 
JANINE No.   Definitely not. 
SYDNEY Wasn't it just the two of you? 
JANINE Not exactly. 
Janine glances to Keenan, as his eyes GO WIDE, grossed out. 
KEENAN Oh, give me a break! No way! Max?! They just had a huge fight. He tried to beat the crap out of him! 
Janine and Sydney exchange a knowing look. 
KEENAN (CONT'D) Oh, Christ, Luke's not queer!   He was just turnin' into a girl! 
JANINE Exactly.   He was a girl. 
KEENAN Oh!   This is just wrong. 
JANINE Would you rather she was attracted to me? 
KEENAN Would you?! 
JANINE Maybe I would! 
SYDNEY Whoa! HANG ON! Right now, Luke needs your help. He needs to know you're behind him, no matter what he wants. 
Janine nods. 
JANINE So, what's all this mean? 
JANINE NO! I want to know! Just exactly what's wrong with being a girl?! 
LUKE Nothin'! It's great!    It's fuckin' PHENOMENAL, if you happen to BE one! 
JANINE Maybe we should've had this conversation the other afternoon?! 
LUKE That wasn't my choice! 
JANINE I sure as hell didn't make you do it! 
KEENAN Janine, will you just let me talk to him for a sec'? 
JANINE Oh, what?! It's a 'GUY THING?!' Give me a fuckin' break! 
Janine storms off with the box. 
KEENAN Sorry, man. She talked me into it. You know Janine. 
Keenan picks up his bike, gets on. 
KEENAN (CONT'D) Look, uh,... you do like bein' a dude, right? 
LUKE Asshole! 
Keenan GRINS, rides off. 
KEENAN (calling back) You should thank me.    The one she picked out was PINK! 
UP THE WALKWAY 
Luke passes a sidewalk trash can and notices the gift box mangled inside. 
Glancing around to make sure no one's watching, he pulls the dress out, brushes off some dirt. 
He shoves it back in the trash, stares at it. 
INT. MINI-MART - NIGHT 
Luke kneels on the floor, stocking candy shelves. 
The CHIME BINGS. 
He peers over the aisle, looks around, no one in sight. 
Michelle appears by the soda dispenser, wary of him. 
MICHELLE Hi. 
LUKE Hey.     How are you? 
MICHELLE I'm okay.     You? 
As they talk, Michelle maneuvers to get closer. 
Luke maneuvers to keep his distance. 
LUKE Okay.     You look really nice. 
MICHELLE Thanks.    I was hopin' you might call. 
LUKE I was going to. 
MICHELLE There's something I need to talk to you about. -But did I do something wrong? 
LUKE No. Nothin' like that. There's just some stuff I've got to sort out. 
MICHELLE Like what? 
They gaze at each other across the magazine rack, 
a mountain range of silence between them,... 
MICHELLE (CONT'D) There's nothing you can't tell me. 
Michelle leans against the shower wall, staring at the spray of water, upset. 
Steam rises, filling the bathroom. 
She begins SINGING, longingly,... 
MICHELLE "I wanna know how to go To the inside of love. I can't find my way through." 
Washing herself, 
behind the shower curtain, 
the timbre of her singing voice mysteriously shifts. 
As her hand turns the shower faucet, it changes... 
MICHELLE (CONT'D) "I'm outside of love, To the side or above, I can't find my way with you" 
A glimpse of her shoulder behind the shower curtain, grows more muscular, 
and her voice begins LOWERING IN PITCH,... 
as MICHELLE BECOMES MAX. 
MAX "Must be a special view, Finding a me with a you, On the inside of love." 
Max steps out of the shower, and towels off in the mirror. 
INT. ORLANDO'S BED & BREAKFAST - NIGHT 
A persistent KNOCK on the door. Sydney pulls on a robe over a pair of men's boxers, wiping sleep from her eyes. She swings the door open. 
Luke stands outside in POURING RAIN. 
SYDNEY Oh, honey.     Come in. 
BY THE FIREPLACE 
Sydney pours hot tea. 
LUKE You're one too.    Why didn't you tell me? 
SYDNEY I didn't want to confuse the issue. 
LUKE So, it's true what you said? You really know. I wouldn't change unless I wanted to? 
SYDNEY Maybe some part of you. 
LUKE What part?    How much of me? I mean, for it to work? Half? More than half? What if it was only a tiny bit, -a thought? 
SYDNEY I don't know. But I believe there may be thousands of Z's out there, millions for all we know, go their whole lives without even knowing they are one. Nothing ever happens. You couldn't keep it from happening. 
LUKE I love being with Michelle. How come I can't control it when she's around? 
SYDNEY I think whatever part of yourself you deny, just gets bigger and bigger until it takes you over. 
Luke nods sadly. 
LUKE You think I don't really want to be a man. 
SYDNEY I think for some, making it stop is more important than knowing who you are. It was for me. 
LUKE Maybe for me too. 
SYDNEY Right now, you're Morphescent. The key is to have sex with another Z. You become Adulmorphic. Your gender locks. You can't just change anytime you want. 
LUKE Another Z? 
SYDNEY That's why I came all the way out here. 
LUKE And why you keep tryin' to get me in the sack? 
SYDNEY Thought maybe I could save you some distress. But you say you're not attracted to me. For it to work, both of us have to be into it. 
MAX Good. 
LUCA Where'd you learn to speak Italian? 
MAX Just tourist stuff. "I'll have the spaghetti bolognese." "How much for a room?" 
LUCA Have you been? 
MAX Little Italy. In New York. Someday, though. Want to go with me? 
Max leans over and KISSES Luca.   She responds, tentatively at first, 
then as she grows more confident,... 
her face REDDENS, she GASPS. 
Luca pulls back, self-conscious, confused.    She brushes sawdust off her dress, stands. 
LUCA Look, this was a mistake. 
MAX Yeah.   Of course.   I know. 
Looking up, Luca sees Keenan, staring at them from across the floor, incredulous. 
Keenan exits out through the giant doors. 
LUCA Oh, Jesus... 
MAX Are you and he...? 
LUCA Huh? 
MAX It's really none of my business. 
LUCA No! I'm sorry.    I shouldn't've come here. 
Max stands, brushes off the sawdust. 
MAX Please don't say you're "just visiting." That you "need to leave." I'm the one who needs to leave. 
Max skates off across the giant shop floor. 
EXT. LUMBER MILL - DUSK The Semi Truck is parked alone in the middle of the asphalt. From inside the cab, the blue dress flips over the rolled down window. 
ACROSS THE PARKING LOT 
Keenan leans against a tractor, rolls his eyes, and twists open another beer, which he gulps. 
AT THE TRUCK 
Luke hops down from the truck cab wearing Langford U. sweats and a T-shirt. 
Keenan sits on the running board. 
KEENAN I mean, what the FUCK is goin' on?! You do wanna' be a girl? You're into guys now? 
LUKE No! I don't know exactly.    I don't know. 
Keenan downs his beer, pensive.   He crushes the can and hurls it, SMACKING a garbage can. 
KEENAN What about Michelle? 
LUKE I had to be sure. I am now. Come on, it's sort of a Catch-22. I make out with a girl, I start turning into one. You gotta' admit, it's a little weird, isn't it? 
Suddenly uncomfortable sitting so close to Luke, Keenan stands. 
LUKE (CONT'D) Let's get outta' here.  You want a ride somewhere? Janine's? 
KEENAN Why don't you go see her?   Think you're more her type. 
Keenan picks up his bike. 
KEENAN (CONT'D) I'll see ya' round, okay? 
The alabaster eyes of a small Greek Statue stares blankly in the direction of the CARNAL SOUNDS coming from the bed, OFF SCREEN... 
SYDNEY (O.S.) Just let yourself go completely. 
LUKE (O.S.) Wow, this is intense. 
SYDNEY (O.S.) When two Z's do it, the lateral hypothalamus gets completely overwhelmed,... 
LUKE (O.S.) OH, MAN!! 
SYDNEY (O.S.) Cellular fission kicks in, and, well,... you can go Zytusional! 
LUKE (O.S.) Unbelievable! 
The chiseled eyes of a two-foot Statue of David, blankly stare. 
LUKE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Oh no.   What's happening? 
Luke's voice begins RISING IN PITCH... 
HALF-LUCA (O.S.) What have you done?! (Luca) NOOOOO!!!! 
The SOUNDS ESCALATE, growing increasingly more INTENSE, 
culminating in the extraordinary, never before heard, 
SOUND OF ZYTUSIONAL CLIMAX... 
LUCA/LUKE AND SYDNEY (O.S.) 
Silence. 
MIRROR - LATER 
A great-looking, bare-chested guy with Sydney's hair appears in reflection: MALE SYDNEY. 
Behind him, still strapped to the bed, is now Luca, a GAG in her mouth. 
Male Sydney carries a phone while fussing with his hair in the mirror. 
MALE SYDNEY (into phone) I hear you're the best. Yes, it's an emergency!   Please. Or I'll have to cut it myself. (to Luca) Now, you look me in the eye, and tell me that wasn't the best sex you ever had. 
Luca MOANS, STRUGGLES VIOLENTLY! 
MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D) (into phone) Half an hour! YES! THANK you! 
Male Sydney clicks the phone off. 
MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D) You can have all my clothes. Oh, and I just bought these incredible Anna Felucci pumps. (reconsiders) Maybe I should keep those. 
Male Sydney returns to dressing, a ribbed tank beneath a gray Italian tux. 
MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D) Okay, I wasn't completely honest with you, but I never lied either. It stopped. That is what you wanted.    You're Adulmorphic now. The only way to switch is to do it with another Z. 
He gazes at Luca, a pang of guilt.   He sits on the bed, speaks softly. 
MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D) I know you don't believe me, but this is the right thing for you. Eventually, you'll figure that on your own. But I could tell it was just gonna' take way too long! 
Luca stares, distraught. 
MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D) Oh, for Chris' sake. Being a woman doesn't make you any less of a man! 
The entire bed LURCHES back and forth as Luca struggles. 
Male Sydney winces, pangs of guilt, which turn to anger... 
MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D) Damnit! I can't live my whole LIFE wrong 'cause of one stupid mistake! I'm a man! I love havin' this chest, these arms! But most of all,... (grabs his pant crotch) Welcome home, boys! Hang in there, I'm takin' you out for a SPIN! 
LATER 
Luca lies alone in the room, bound and gagged on the bed. 
A KNOCK at the door. 
INSIDE THE SEMI The truck CAREENS around a CURVE. 
LUCA Can't this thing go any faster?! 
Luca considers... 
LUCA (CONT'D) You know me better than anyone. What do you think? 
KEENAN Huh? 
LUCA I mean, if I weren't a hundred percent sure which I'm s'posed to be. If you had to say. 
KEENAN All I know is, every time you look at Michelle, or think about her, you smile. What the hell else do you need to know? 
LUCA It's not right. She deserves to be with a normal guy. 
KEENAN So, you don't get to be with anyone? 
They drive in silence. 
KEENAN (CONT'D) That why they call it "zero- philia?" 
LUCA She's not gonna' want some guy who thinks maybe he's supposed to be a girl sometimes. 
KEENAN How do you know? Did you ask? 
LUCA No way I'm gonna' ask her that. 
KEENAN Well, you have to.   Where are your nads, man?! 
Luca glares at him.   Keenan realizes his mistake... 
KEENAN (CONT'D) We'll get 'em back. 
The truck ROARS on. 
EXT. POLLY WOG'S 
As Janine looks on, Male Sydney moves in for the kill. 
MALE SYDNEY Come on, let's grab a couple beers. 
Sydney tugs at his T-shirt. 
MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D) Of course, I see you brought your own six-pack. 
GRAVEL PARKING LOT 
Keenan and Luca hop down from Luke's truck, scanning the crowd. 
Janine waves to Luca and points across the way. 
Luca nods. 
LUCA Let's go! 
KEENAN Jeez.    She won't even look at me. 
They stride across the field. 
BEHIND THE BARN 
Male Sydney shoves Jeremy passionately against the wall. 
MALE SYDNEY I do love to mess with Texas. 
Keenan and Luca appear around the corner. 
LUCA There! 
MALE SYDNEY We better get outta' here. 
Keenan reaches them first.      He wrenches Male Sydney and Jeremy apart. 
LUCA I'm not sure. 
MICHELLE You asshole! 
Michelle moves off. 
ALONGSIDE THE BARN 
Luca runs up. 
MICHELLE I don't believe this.    You slept with that guy?! 
LUCA It's not what you think. 
MICHELLE Oh, please! What about Max? 
LUCA What about him? 
MICHELLE Don't you care about him at all?! 
LUCA Not like that: I'm straight!   I'm attracted to you! 
MICHELLE Oh, who cares, you idiot! And sorry to break it to you, but I'm straight too. 
LUCA No. This'll sound crazy, but I'm not who you think I am- 
MICHELLE Oh, Christ, Luke, -Luca: I know who you are! 
Luca stares, stunned. 
LUCA You know I'm a Zerophiliac?! 
MICHELLE Yes! So you can just go fuck yourself. -Literally! 
LUCA Does Max know who I am? 
MICHELLE What if he does? Do you? 
LUCA He's a guy! 
MICHELLE And you're a girl! 
LUCA I'm not! 
Michelle gestures "Oh really?!" 
LUCA (CONT'D) I'm not supposed to be! 
MICHELLE There's no supposed to be anything, you just ARE! 
LUCA Is that what you think?!   NO! 
MICHELLE Well, then congratulations! You're a guy, just like every other guy I ever met! I can't believe you slept with him! 
LUCA He was a woman! I was tricked.   I didn't know I'd switch. 
Michelle stares, incredulous. 
MICHELLE You're gonna' tell me he's a Z too?! Both of you?! 
LUCA Yes! 
MICHELLE Well, that's just perfect. What, is there something in the water around here?! 
LUCA She told me it would make it stop. That it would keep me from turning into a girl. 
MICHELLE So what?! Why's that so important to you?! There's no way this was gonna' work. 
LUCA Because I'm a Zerophiliac. 
MICHELLE Because you can't stand being one! Bye, Luca. 
LUCA (correcting her) Luke.

MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 
16TH AUGUST 1995 
NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS AND SOME "SCENE OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. 
INT. KIEV APARTMENT - NIGHT 
We're in a large closet.  JACK KIEFER, an athletic American in his late thirties wearing a headset, is wedged into a corner, staring at a television screen. 
The television shows a surveillance view of the living room that lies outside the confines of the closet.  The TV image is in black and white.  JACK shifts, trying like hell to get comfortable but he's been there a while 
ON THE SCREEN 
A bare bulb shines down on the contents of a shabby hotel room.  Directly under the blub a man, GENNADY KASIMOV, sits in a straight backed wooden chair in his blood-stained T- shirt.  There are a couple of THUGS and a stray HOOKER in the room behind him.  A legend: 
KIEV 
KASIMOV is sobbing.  Uncontrollably.  A MAN enters the room, ANATOLY, an imperious Russian in his forties, a Russian godfather.  The THUGS and HOOKERS are ushered out.  ANATOLY looks down at KASIMOV pitiously and urges him to go and sit by him in a chair he picks up for him.  KASIMOV does as he is bid, looking gratefully up at ANATOLY.  They speak in Russian which is subtitled. 
ANATOLY Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us. 
KASIMOV (sobbing) I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun. 
ANATOLY gets up out of the chair and goes to a bed across the room.  A WOMAN lies half under the sheets.  She's lying in an unnatural position on the bed, and the sheets are smeared with blood.  She's dead.  ANATOLY lifts her eyelid. 
KASIMOV I don't even know how I got here. I swear, Anatoly, I never touched her!  I didn't lay a finger on her. 
ANATOLY moves away from the WOMAN. 
ANATOLY Kasimov.  Don't flounder. 
IN THE CLOSET 
JACK, impatient, checks his watch. 
JACK Jesus, she's been under too long.  Come on, come on! 
ON THE SCREEN 
KASIMOV You're the only one who can help me. 
Desperately he tugs at ANATOLY'S jacket.  But ANATOLY hits his hand away and smacks him around the head. 
IN THE CLOSET 
JACK reacts. 
ON THE SCREEN 
ANATOLY bends close to KASIMOV. 
ANATOLY C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon. 
KASIMOV They'll kill me. 
ANATOLY paces up the room, away from KASIMOV. 
ANATOLY You asked for my help.  You asked for my help...come on... 
KASIMOV You're right, of course. 
IN THE CLOSET 
JACK leans forward. 
JACK The name pal...give us the name. 
ON THE SCREEN 
KASIMOV The contact in Minsk..the contact in Minsk..works in a travel agency. 
IN THE CLOSET 
JACK comes into the room from the closet.  He hands CLAIRE her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring.  ETHAN stops what he's doing, noticing.  She looks up at him, questioningly. 
JACK Claire. 
ETHAN Jack. 
She almost unconsciously slips the wedding ring onto her finger.  ETHAN notices.  He turns and SHOUTS to the room at large. 
ETHAN IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?! 
JACK Just waiting for you, tubs. 
He walks across the room and out the door.  CLAIRE, worried, clutches her hands together, glancing down at her wedding ring. 
We move in on it -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. JET - DAY 
-- and come out on another wedding ring, this one on a MAN's finger. One of several he's drumming on an arm rest in the plush first class cabin of a commercial airliner.  He shoves some money into his wallet, and as he does so we catch a fleeting glimpse of a photograph of CLAIRE. 
The pilot's voice makes an announcement. 
VOICE (O.S.) Ladies and gentlemen, we have leveled off at our cruising altitude of thirty-eight thousand feet-and we should be arriving in Prague right on schedule. 
A FLIGHT ATTENDANT makes her way between the seats, passing out menus. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Would you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen? 
A passenger takes one.  The ATTENDANT continues on. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT'D) Would you like to watch a movie Mr Phelps? 
The MAN with the wedding ring looks up.  JIM PHELPS is in his mid-forties, good-looking, intense.  He's a tired man, and not just now, it's a profound fatigue.  He looks up at the ATTENDANT and smiles warmly. 
PHELPS No, I prefer the theatre. 
A look crosses the FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S face; her tone becomes stilted. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Would you consider the cinema of the Ukraine? 
PHELPS Perhaps you'd choose one for me. 
The ATTENDANT turns and walks away.  PHELPS sits back, shakes a cigarette out of a pack, and taps it nervously on the armrest. 
AT THE FRONT OF THE CABIN. 
The FLIGHT ATTENDANT opens a case loaded with video 8 cassettes of feature films.  She opens a panel in the top of the case and withdraws a tape hidden back there. 
BACK AT PHELPS' SEAT 
The ATTENDANT returns with the tape and hands it to PHELPS. He takes it without a word and she moves on. 
PHELPS reaches down and turns a lever on the support between his seat and the empty one beside him. He flips up a small movie screen and angles it toward himself, away from the other passengers. He puts on a headset, opens a door in the armrest, and puts the tape in. 
He presses play. 
ON THE TAPE, 
the image of a man comes on.  EUGENE KITTRIDGE is fortyish, but seems permanently stuck in the Nixon era -- horn rimmed glasses, short short haircut, rather be caught dead than tieless.  But if he catches your eye, he will never, ever look away.  He's seated at a desk, looking into the camera. 
KITTRIDGE (on the tape) Good morning, Mr. Phelps.  The man you're about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn -- 
The screen winks and shows an image of GOLITSYN, a burly man in his forties.  The image is herky-jerky videotape, presumably taken from a concealed camera as GOLITSYN walks down a foreign street. 
KITTRIDGE (O.S.) -- a former KGB Line X officer now working the international black market selling intelligence.  This morning, we learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half of a CIA NOC list, the list of our non- official cover agents working in Eastern Europe. 
The screen shows an image of what such a list might look like, code names and other information scrolling by on a computer screen at high speed. 
KITTRIDGE (O.S.) For security reasons, the NOC list is divided into two encoded halves. Golitsyn already has the cryptonym portion, which contains agent code names and targeting areas.  This portion is useless unless combined with the second half -- the true name list that is kept in the CIA station in our Embassy in Prague. 
The Embassy itself comes on screen, a beautiful old building at the base of the Charles Bridge, which spans the Vltava River. 
KITTRIDGE (O.S.) We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the true name list at an Embassy function tomorrow night.  Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to obtain photographic proof of the theft, apprehend those involved, and return the stolen list.  I don't have to stress the importance of this matter, Jim.  We're keeping it internally black. Because of its urgency, I've already sent to Prague a team selected from your usual group. 
Still photographs come on screen, some of which we're already seen -- JACK KIEFER, CLAIRE and ETHAN. 
ETHAN Why not? 
PHELPS Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out. 
CLAIRE, who is at the computer behind them, somehow seems to be the reference point in the following exchange: 
ETHAN How was Chicago? 
PHELPS Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!" 
PHELPS laughs.  ETHAN doesn't.  The back of CLAIRE'S head is in his line of sight. 
PHELPS (CONT'D) Boy, you really are grim. Come here, take a look. 
He leads ETHAN to the window, which overlooks the city. 
EXT. PRAGUE - DAY 
ETHAN's POV of Embassy. 
INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY 
ETHAN nods. 
PHELPS (CONT'D) Beyond Charles Bridge there is our Embassy.  See it?  Tomorrow night, if anything goes wrong, this guy will steal the names of our agents in every country all over Eastern Europe.  Up for grabs to the highest bidders -- third world terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords -- any and everybody who'd love to get rid of long term coverts like us, and some very dear friends among them.  If they're exposed, they'll be executed.  Come over here.  Take a lock at this. 
CLAIRE, who is working at a computer, has pulled up a quicktime video image in a box on her screen.  In it, an old edition of the McLaughlin Report, the PBS news show, is playing. 
ETHAN is distracted by it. 
INSERT - TELEVISION 
SENATOR WALTZER, a bearded, bespectacled man in his forties, is holding forth: 
SENATOR WALTZER I'll go you one further.  I say the CIA and all its shadow organizations have become irrelevant at best and unconstitutional at worst.  It's time we throw a little light on the whole concept of the Pentagon's "black budget."  These covert agency subgroups have confidential funding, they report to no one -- who are these people?!  We were living in a democracy the last time I checked. 
BACK TO SCENE 
ETHAN looks back at JIM. 
ETHAN You're going to use Walter? 
PHELPS He's our guy. 
ETHAN Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing? 
PHELPS Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides. 
ETHAN He won't be back in a hurry? 
PHELPS No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work? 
ETHAN Sure.  If the main character does. 
PHELPS If you were me, Ethan, who would you trust to make him believable? 
JACK comes breezing in with a piece of bubble gum. 
JACK Sorry, am I interrupting? 
ETHAN Always. 
JACK shows the gum to ETHAN. 
JACK Stick of gum. If you come up against a lock you can't pick -- 
Half the gum is red, the other half is green. 
JACK (CONT'D) Red light.  Green light.  Mash them together, asta lasagna.  Don't get any on you -- you have five seconds. 
He offers the gum to ETHAN. 
PHELPS Are you gonna take it? 
CLAIRE glances up from the computer and catches ETHAN's eye. PHELPS may have caught the glance, but is focused on ETHAN. 
ETHAN (relenting) Give me the God damn gum. 
JACK Great.  Come on. 
INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT 
As the SENATOR and SARAH pass behind the entering GOLITSYN, SARAH pulls a small bottle of perfume from her purse.  But as she sprays, she points it slightly to the left, missing herself and hitting the back of GOLITSYN'S head.  He never notices.  They move on and down the flight of stairs. 
INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 
JIM PHELPS monitors the Visco views of the party.  He looks to the fourth monitor and checks a view of the party, a jumpy one, as someone hurrying up stairs. 
PHELPS Hannah.  He's marked.  Lets go. 
INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT 
On a flight of stairs, HANNAH, dressed for the party and slightly out of breath, hurries up the stairs. 
HANNAH En route. 
She also has a pair of Visco glasses, which she trains on the party below.  She pushes a micro switch on the side of her glasses, activating an electronic filter, which tints the lenses. 
PHELPS (O/S) Hannah, pull the shade (or - Hannah go to night vision). 
HANNAHíS VISCO POV 
the party looks the same, but one head in the crowd stands out.  That head is GOLITSYN'S, his hair a fluorescent green where SARAH sprayed it. 
INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT 
The SENATOR (let's just call him ETHAN) and SARAH come down the stairs and pass a sign that says "Denied Area -- Political Attaches Only."  ETHAN checks his watch.  23:00. 
He nods to SARAH, they round a corner, and come to an elevator at the end of the corridor.  A sign in front of it says "Out of Order."  They head for it anyway. 
A MARINE GUARD appears from behind a side door, catching them by surprise. 
JACK Governor's in position.  We have the elevator. 
GUARD Excuse me, can I help you? 
SARAH -- which leads directly to the Denied Area, the only limited access area in the whole facility. 
SARAH flashes an ID at the GUARD and keeps talking. 
SARAH (CONT'D) As you can see. this area has both a Marine guard and video surveillance, and is strictly monitored at all times. 
She walks up to the thumbprint analyzer on the elevator bank and slides her thumb inside.  The panel lights up and flashes a message -- "ACCESS DENIED."  SARAH and ETHAN trade a look. 
SARAH (CONT'D) (covering) Senator, don't you have a young man on your staff named JACK? 
She tries the thumb again, Still no soap. 
ETHAN Jack?  I believe we did have a young man named Jack.  Not a reliable man, as I recall.  Constantly late or behind in his work. 
Now the GUARD, noticing that Sarah's not being allowed access, comes closer to them. 
GUARD Excuse me, let me see that ID again! 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT 
JACK is still pinned to the wall by the elevator, listening to their conversation. 
PHELPS (O.S.) Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing. 
ETHAN (O.S.) (with the Senator's southern accent) We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times. 
Finally, the elevator moves down a floor and JACK is freed. 
JACK Relax your crack, Foghorn, I'm workin' on it. 
He quickly opens the gray metal box, revealing a maze of circuitry.  He patches in his computer, climbs on top of the elevator, and hits the keyboard, beginning to download. 
THE LAPTOP 
there's a split-screen of SARAH's thumbprint and the ID picture.  JACK downloads her file into the security computer. 
INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT 
Ignoring the GUARD, SARAH turns and slides her thumb into the thumbprint analyzer once more.  The panel glows, this time the message flashes -- 
EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHT 
PHELPS dashes onto the Charles Bridge and heads across the river, toward the Embassy.  He throws a look back, over his shoulder.  Paranoiaís setting in. 
EXT. EMBASSY (AS SEEN FROM CHARLES BRIDGE) - NIGHT 
Outside the Embassy, GOLITSYN escapes, pushing through the service area door and racing past a DRUNKEN COUPLE who are in the midst of a loverís quarrel, in Russian. 
Pan past the embankment and onto the bridge where PHELPS is still racing to meet ETHAN.  But he stops suddenly, as if hearing something and looks behind him, at the deepening gloom. 
EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT 
ETHAN and SARAH hear PHELPíS voice over the monitor. 
SARAH The package is in the open. 
ETHAN Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open. 
PHELPS (O.S.) Iíve got a shadow. 
ETHAN Can you lose him? 
PHELPS (O.S.) No.  Abort. 
Over ETHANís shoulder, SARAH sees GOLITSYN getting away.  Fog starts to roll over the river towards the bridge. 
SARAH Ethan.  Heís out of pocket. 
ETHAN (to Phelps) Jim we canít. 
PHELPS (O.S.) Abort.  Thatís an order. 
ETHAN Negative, Golitsynís on the move. 
INT. GETAWAY CAR - NIGHT 
Seated in the getaway car, CLAIRE listens to JIM and ETHAN argue. 
PHELPS (O.S.) No, damn it, no, I said ABORT! 
EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT 
Outside the Embassy, SARAH and ETHAN argue. 
ETHAN Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you. 
SARAH Jim gave an abort, we should walk away. 
ETHAN No, weíre going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move! 
ETHAN takes off for the bridge, leaving SARAH to shadow GOLITSYN. 
EXT. PARKING AREA - NIGHT 
HANNAH hurries toward the getaway vehicle. 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT 
ETHAN moves to the bridge stairs. 
PHELPS (O.S.) Where are you? 
ETHAN About two hundred yards from the bridge. 
PHELPS (O.S.) Theyíre covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications.  Repeat. Cut all radio communications. 
ETHAN continues to run toward the stairs to the bridge.  Past CLAIRE who sits in the getaway car.  He looks on his monitor and again sees PHELPSí POV.  Only ominous silence.  Phelps is looking back over his shoulder.  The bridge is deserted. 
EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT 
SARAH follows GOLITSYN as he hurries toward the shore, where a cobblestone promenade runs along the river.  He disappears into the fog at the edge of the river. 
EXT. STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHT 
ETHAN checks his monitor again. 
THE MONITOR 
He screws the mouthpiece back on, holds the phoneís tongue down for a second, releases it and listens.  He has a dial tone.  Now he punches in a fourteen digit number he knows by heart. 
After a moment, a FLAT VOICE comes on the other side. 
FLAT VOICE (O.S.) Satcom seven. 
ETHAN Central Europe.  Unsecured. 
FLAT VOICE (O.S.) Designator? 
ETHAN Bravo Echo one one. 
FLAT VOICE (O.S.) Switching. 
There is a long pause and then familiar voice comes on the line. 
KITTRIDGE (O.S.) This is Kittridge. 
ETHAN Go secure. 
Pause.  A funny series of CLICKS comes over the line. 
KITTRIDGE (O.S.) Go ahead. 
ETHAN Theyíre dead. 
KITTRIDGE (O.S.) Whoís dead? 
ETHAN My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know 
KITTRIDGE (O.S.) Are you damaged? 
ETHAN They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís dead too.  The disk is gone. 
KITTRIDGE (O.S.) Are you intact? 
ETHAN Do you read me?  The list is in the open! 
KITTRIDGE (O.S.) Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you followed? 
ETHAN closes his eyes.  KITTRIDGEíS voice is strong and reassuring and he needs that right now. 
ETHAN I donít think so. 
KITTRIDGE (O.S.) Donít think, be sure.  Are you clean? 
ETHAN Yes. 
KITTRIDGE (O.S.) Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself. 
ETHAN Youíre in Prague? 
KITTRIDGE (O.S.) Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me. 
ETHAN No sir. 
KITTRIDGE (O.S.) One hour. 
He hangs up.  ETHAN does the same.  He stares at the phone for a moment, thinking.  He checks his watch. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
ETHAN steps out of the phone booth and starts down the street.  Every face seems to be starring at him now, every sound is menacing.  He pulls his coat in tight, shoves his hands in his pockets and walks among the crowd. 
EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT 
ETHAN makes his way past the old town clock, a towering, gothic structure and into a plaza, surrounded mostly by residential buildings. 
ETHANíS POV 
Straight across from him is a glass enclosed restaurant built on the portico of an old palace. 
Brilliantly lit up from inside, the restaurant positively shimmers, every table visible from everywhere in the plaza. 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
ETHAN'S POV 
Diners look up, startled at the sound of the breaking wine glass.  KITTRIDGE follows the trajectory of the glass -- 
-- and sees the piece of gum, stuck to the tank. His eyes widen.  KA BOOM! 
The tiny piece of plastique explodes, SHATTERING the fish tank.  A hundred gallons of water flow over the MAN and WOMAN, knocking them to the ground. 
At the same time, ETHAN bolts for the door. 
EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT 
ETHAN races out of the restaurant and takes off, into the deserted square. 
EXT. SAFE HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT 
Silence.  ETHAN enters the darkened entry. 
INT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - NIGHT 
ETHAN glances up at the stairwell.  Naked light bulbs illuminate the way up.  He slips off his jacket and shirt, then puts his jacket back on. 
INT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 
ETHAN unscrews a bulb.  He crushes the bulb in his shirt and scatters the glass fragments on the steps.  He climbs to the next bulb. 
INT. SAFE HOUSE - DOORWAY - NIGHT 
At the now-darkened door to the apartment, there's the soft sound of another bulb being POPPED in cloth, glass fragments dropping and ETHAN'S at the door. 
INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 
In the darkened safe house, ETHAN goes to a vase with flowers, picks it up and unscrews the bottom, retrieving a Sig Sauer automatic. He moves through the rooms, checking them as he goes. 
INT. SAFE HOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT 
ETHAN checks the shower, then goes to his shaving kit, pulling out a shaving cream can and a hairspray can.  He unscrews the bottoms, retrieving cash in various denominations from various countries and a couple of passports. 
As he pockets them, he catches sight of himself in the mirror.  He's a mess.  He splashes water on his face. 
INT. SAFE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT 
ETHAN greedily tears the cap off a bottle of mineral water and proceeds to guzzle it as if he was dying of thirst. 
INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 
He comes back into the living room. Still drinking, he notices flickering lights on the other side of the room, the static from the four monitors PHELPS was watching.  One by one, he switches them off. 
THE LAPTOP 
JACK had been using lies closed at his abandoned desk.  ETHAN wakes it up. 
The computer emits a DIAL TONE, then STATIC as it hits its connection.  It prompts ETHAN along: 
SELECT USENET GROUP 
ETHAN TYPES IN 
job 314 
ETHAN Job.  Job 3:14.  March fourteen.  Job 31 March. 
The computer replies: 
SEARCHING STRING NOT FOUND 
ETHAN tries again: 
max.com 
The answer: 
SEARCH STRING NOT FOUND 
He tries a few more, quickly -- "job," "jobs," "joblist.com," but nothing comes up.  He tries something else -- "scroll usenet groups." 
The computer scrolls names of bulletin boards at a dizzying speed, by the hundreds.  That's not going anywhere. 
ETHAN pauses, slaking his bottomless thirst and trying to figure out what permutation of "job 314" he should add to the others on his computer screen.  He MUMBLES. 
MAX Very good. 
ETHAN Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first. 
ANGLE 
MATTHIAS boots up.  There's a little musical noise and the screen brightens.  The computer WHIRS and CLICKS and a complex list of names, addresses, phone numbers and other personal information scrolls by.  But Matthias is watching the digital read-out on the RF scanner. 
MATTHIAS Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good. 
MAX That's not so good for you, my friend. 
On the scanner, the digital read-out is now in the thirties. 
MATTHIAS Thirty-two and change. 
MAX (to Ethan) Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up. 
She looks from the scanner to ETHAN as if she's trying to make up her mind about something. 
MATTHIAS Forty-four.  Forty-five. 
ETHAN I'd say you've got about two minutes. 
MAX still doubts it. The OTHER MAN goes to the windows -- 
--nothing happens. He opens the French doors that lead out onto a balcony. 
EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT - BALCONY - DAY 
The OTHER MAN comes out on the balcony.  Nothing out here but a beautiful day.  He walks to the railing and looks down at the street. 
Down below, the dog that's still barking is tied to a street sign.  WOOF.  WOOF.  WOOF.  Abruptly, it stops. 
INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Back inside: 
MATTHIAS Fifty-seven. Fifty-nine. 
EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT 
A pollution control van and a taxi arrive amidst other street activity. KITTRIDGE and the FEMALE CZECH AGENT exit the taxi as BARNES and TWO OTHER UNDERCOVER MALE IMF agents leave the van. 
INT. MAX'S BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY 
Led by KITTRIDGE, the FIVE IMF AGENTS wearing Kevlar-lined trenchcoats creep through the lobby of the building and hit the stairs. They climb them silently. 
INT. MAX'S BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY 
A CLEANING WOMAN is vacuuming the hall carpeting when the AGENTS come up the stairs, guns drawn. Her jaw drops and she turns off the vacuum cleaner. 
FEMALE IMF (in czech) Switch it on.  Keep cleaning. 
KITTRIDGE looks at her sharply and gestures.  She turns the vacuum back on. They reach the door of a certain apartment and -- 
INT. APARTMENT - DAY 
-- KICK through it.  The AGENTS swarm into MAX'S apartment, guns waving in all directions.  KITTRIDGE sweeps in between them and takes command of the place -- 
--but there's nobody here.  TWO AGENTS race into the bedroom, and just as quickly out again. 
EXT. POWDER TOWER - TOP SHOT - DAY 
MAX, ETHAN, MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN move quickly across the bridge that connects Max's apartment to the tower. 
EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT BALCONY - DAY 
KITTRIDGE kicks open the door to the balcony, comes outside, and looks around.  Nobody in sight. 
KITTRIDGE GOD D- 
INT. MAX'S CAR - ETHAN AND MAX - DAY 
MAX Oh dear, Gunther will never let me use one of his apartments again. (turns to Ethan) Phew, sorry I doubted you, dear boy. You're a good sport.  Do accept the compliment. 
ETHAN Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine? 
He types in a single word. 
DISAVOWED 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. TRAIN - STATEROOM - NIGHT 
The word "disavowed" dissolves slowly over the stateroom of a high speed train, where the newly assembled IM force has gathered around a table -- KRIEGER, a dangerous-looking Frenchman of forty or so, LUTHER STICKELL, a muscular, soft- spoken American in his mid-thirties.  ETHAN, and CLAIRE. LUTHER regards the others warily. 
ETHAN Simple game.  Four players. (points to Krieger) Exfil opens the pocket -- (and to Luther) -- cyber ops lifts the wallet. 
KRIEGER Bank? 
ETHAN IMF mainframe. 
KRIEGER (after a moment) Where exactly is it? 
ETHAN In Langley. 
LUTHER In Langley?  The one in Virginia, Langley? 
KRIEGER Inside CIA headquarters at Langley. 
ETHAN nods.  KRIEGER turns to CLAIRE. 
KRIEGER (CONT'D) Is he serious? 
CLAIRE Always. 
KRIEGER If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA. 
LUTHER What are we downloading? 
ETHAN Information. 
LUTHER What kind? 
ETHAN Profitable. 
CLAIRE Payment on delivery. 
LUTHER I don't know.  This I don't know. 
ETHAN This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom. 
LUTHER There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that.. (correcting himself) With that exceptional piece of work. 
ETHAN You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks. 
LUTHER You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's -- 
CLAIRE Krieger can get it. (to Krieger) Right? 
KRIEGER May take a little time. 
ETHAN May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you. 
LUTHER Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- with the artificial intelligence Risk chip -- 
ETHAN looks at KRIEGER. 
KRIEGER Twenty-four hours. 
ETHAN looks back at LUTHER.  LUTHER thinks. 
LUTHER And I get to keep the equipment when we're done. 
ETHAN Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses. 
LUTHER I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal. 
ETHAN Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down. 
INT. CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY 
While ETHAN talks, we see what he's referring to: 
And they're suddenly, violently in each others arms, kissing and half-falling onto the converted bed.  She suddenly resists.  He senses it and pulls away. 
ETHAN Sorry. 
He rises and goes to the door.  He's got his hand on the knob when CLAIRE wraps her arms around him from behind, turns him to her and kisses him, deeply.  This time they sink slowly to the bed. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CIA LANGLEY - DAY 
Seen from the air, CIA headquarters is a sprawling complex, two huge buildings surrounded by acres of parking lots hacked out of a thick forest. 
LANGLEY 
INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY 
KITTRIDGE, BARNES, and their STAFF are hard at work, photographs and biographical data of ETHAN on various computer and television screens around the room.  KITTRIDGE leans back in his chair, staring at the ceiling. 
BARNES What I want to know is how Hunt accessed the disavowed file, even after we cut off his authorization code. 
AGENT LOWDEN/AGENT MAREK He may have used Phelps' code. They were friends, and Phelps, was still valid for twenty-four hours. 
BARNES If that's the case, we need to implement a system to immediately deactivate an agent's code immediately... 
KITTRIDGE brings his chair legs down on the floor with a BANG. 
KITTRIDGE I can't believe what I'm listening to. Hunt just kicked us in the ass, you guys are standing here trying to figure out what kind of shoes he had on!  I don't care how he did it, I want to know why he did it!  Is he recruiting?  For what purpose? 
From somewhere in the building, an ALARM sounds, not too loud in here. 
AGENT PAT/AGENT LOWDEN Survival. 
The alarm get louder as it goes off in another part of the building. 
KITTRIDGE Too short sighted.  This guy's proactive, he initiates.  The question is what does he want now and where does he need to get it and Barnes what the hell is that noise?! 
An AGENT is just coming in from the hallway. 
AGENT Fire alarm, Gene. 
KITTRIDGE Oh, for -- do we have to evacuate? 
BARNES That's S.O.P.. 
KITTRIDGE S.O.P.. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. VIRGINIA TWO LANE HIGHWAY - DAY 
SIRENS BLARING, three fire trucks race past an inconspicuous gray van parked on the shoulder of a two lane highway. 
INT. CIA LANGLEY LOBBY - DAY 
Three FIREMEN stomp into the main lobby of the CIA headquarters building.  ETHAN and KRIEGER are among them, in firemen's jumpsuits, carrying packs of equipment. 
ETHAN takes a breath as they cross to the GUARD's desk.  He looks up, above him. 
Etched into the top of one wall are the words "AND YE SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE." 
They reach the GUARD.  ETHAN, who wears Visco glasses, elbows to the front of the group and takes charge. 
ETHAN (to the Guard) We picked up alarms in sectors three, seven, and twelve. 
The GUARD checks a screen in front of him. 
GUARD RICHARD Yeah.  That's what I've got too. 
The FIREMEN look at each other.  Who is this guy?  But he seems to know what he's talking about, so -- 
ETHAN (to the Guard) What sector's the air conditioning? 
GUARD RANDALL Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one. 
ETHAN I gotta go in there and shut it down! 
GUARD RANDALL Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off. 
INT. CIA - SERVICE AREA - DAY 
ETHAN and KRIEGER in the service area - preparing.  ETHAN putting the mask in a bag. 
The GUARD returns. 
GUARD Where's the other guy? 
The GUARD moves towards ETHAN, who kicks back at him, pushing him back to KRIEGER, who zaps the GUARD on the back of the neck.  He twitches and slumps to the ground, unconscious. KRIEGER quickly grabs him around the neck. 
ETHAN turns.  Holding the GUARD'S head with one hand, KRIEGER pulls a stiletto from the sheath in the back of his belt with the other.  He jabs it toward the base of the GUARD'S skull - 
-- but ETHAN is on him in a flash.  He grabs KRIEGER's knife arm shoving it up against the wall.  Staring into KRIEGER'S face in warning. 
ETHAN Zero body count. 
KRIEGER (a threat) We'll see. 
ETHAN Time up. 
ETHAN releases him and walks away. 
INT. VERTICAL DUCT - DAY 
The Guard is tied up, lying on the floor of the Service Area Room.  ETHAN and KRIEGER are below the open vent into the duct system. 
The first climb is straight up.  KRIEGER cups his hands under ETHAN'S foot and lifts him up into the duct as he starts to climb. 
INT. DUCT - DAY 
ETHAN and KRIEGER crawl quickly through the ducts, moving horizontally now.  They reach a juncture and turn right. 
ETHAN 1 - 2 - 3 - Toast, toast.  Luther, I'm going in.  Don't disappoint me...Krieger, from here on in, absolute silence. 
INT. DUCT - DAY 
ETHAN and KRIEGER reach a ventilator shaft in the duct.  A laser net protects the ventilator, red shafts of light cris- crossing every which way.  ETHAN looks down, through the net. 
He can see the computer room below and the top of the TECHNICIAN'S head. 
INT. DUCT - DAY 
In the duct, ETHAN signals to KRIEGER, making a triangle of his hands.  KRIEGER wriggles forward and hands him a multi- sided, pyramid shaped glass object. 
ETHAN raises the pyramid and intercepts a portion of one of the laser net's beams. The pyramid glows and we realise what it is -- a prism. 
The laser beam now captive in the prism, ETHAN carefully moves it out of the centre of the ventilator shaft and directs it toward another prism, clearing a path through the shaft. 
INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY 
Up in the ceiling above it, one of the screws starts to move in the ventilator shaft, unscrewing.  When it appears ready to drop out, a thin strip of metal snakes out from between the bars of the shaft and edges up next to the screw. 
The screw drops out of its hole but it doesn't drop to the floor, it zips over and clings to the side of the metal strip with a gentle CLICK, as to a magnet. 
The screw is pulled up, through the shaft.  Now the whole shaft moves, down, into the room, held by a hand. 
It turns sideways and is pulled up, into the duct. 
A rubber tube snakes down, through the hole, coming to a stop near the thermostat, which says it's seventy-two degrees.  A gentle WHOOSH is audible as frosty air blows through the tube, cooling the room. 
INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY 
The TECHNICIAN defaults the security systems outside the terminal room. 
INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY 
It is eerily still in the locked-down computer room we saw earlier.  No-one is there, there's not a sound but for the gentle HUM of the computer as it waits to be put to use. 
Now ETHAN's head descends slowly into the room, his hair falling in front of him. 
At first it seems he's just poking his head in for a look, but he keeps coming and coming -- first his head, then shoulders, then waist, then knees, and finally we see his ankles and understand. 
He is lowered to stop in front of the thermometer and temperature read out on the computer.  Suddenly ETHAN is lifted back up quickly to hang at ceiling height above the computer as the ANALYST enters the room. 
INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY 
The TECHNICIAN crosses to the computer and sits down, a stack of work to his right. 
LUTHER'S eyes widen as he gets his first look, on the Visco monitor, of the specific information they're downloading. The NOC list. 
LUTHER Holy mother of God. 
INT. DUCT - DAY 
KRIEGER shakes with the strain of holding the rope.  His eyes suddenly widen as he sees something next to him. 
It's a rat.  KRIEGER stares. The rat stares back.  Neither moves.  Puzzled by KRIEGER'S lack of response, the rat crawls forward, inquisitive. 
KRIEGER's eyes water, his nose twitches.  He's about to sneeze. 
INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY 
LUTHER pulls himself together and WHISPERS another command into the microphone. 
LUTHER You've done it.  Eject it. 
INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY 
The 3.5 disk is ejected from the floppy drive.  ETHAN pockets it and signals to be raised. 
Slowly, his body starts to move up.  As it does, a bead of sweat rolls down his nose, balling at the tip. 
ETHAN ignores it.  But below him, he sees the floor tiles, four of them lit up under the wheels of the chair at the computer terminal. 
His eyes widen as he realizes something -- 
--the drop of sweat falls -- 
--and he catches it with his right hand. 
INT. CIA - MEN'S - DAY 
CIA ANALYST crosses corridor from restricted access door to bathroom. 
A toilet FLUSHES, smashing the silence, and the TECHNICIAN staggers out of the bathroom. He goes to the sink and throws some water on his face. He's still unaware of the piece of shiny metallic tape stuck to his shoulder blade. 
He walks out of the bathroom, crosses corridor to door. 
INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY 
On one of LUTHER'S laptops, the blinking cursor starts to move down a corridor.  LUTHER speaks into his microphone. 
LUTHER He's rolling.  Get moving! 
INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY 
ETHAN is near the ceiling, but KRIEGER isn't pulling any more.  ETHAN looks up at him, wide-eyed and gestures to pull him up.  KRIEGER shakes his head no. 
ETHAN gestures -- "WHAT?!" 
INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY 
The cursor is halfway across the screen. 
LUTHER Get out of there -- get out of there -- 
INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY 
ETHAN still dangles.  Holding the rope with one hand, KRIEGER holds out his other, demanding something.  He wants the disk. 
INT. CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY 
The TECHNICIAN makes his way back down the corridor, toward the computer room. 
INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY 
The blinking cursor is near the edge of the screen and LUTHER is sweating. 
LUTHER He's at the vault - get moving!  1 yellow, 2 yellows...Toast! 
INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY 
ETHAN, still hanging upside down, has refused.  KRIEGER demands again. 
INT. CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY 
EXT. VIRGINIA ROAD - DAY 
It may be a HUMAN SCREAM or it may be a SIREN'S WAIL but it echoes over the forest as a lone fire truck ROARS away from the headquarters building, making its escape. 
INT. FIRE TRUCK - MOVING - DAY 
LUTHER, KRIEGER, CLAIRE and ETHAN, the victorious team, are in the truck's cab.  They exchange looks of massive relief. But no one speaks.  LUTHER, in particular, looks heavily troubled by what they've just done. 
ETHAN looks at CLAIRE, who is jammed into the seat next to him.  She drops her head on his shoulder, exhausted. 
KRIEGER, in the driver's seat literally and figuratively. 
ETHAN just looks straight ahead and to CLAIRE. 
CUT TO: 
INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY 
The TECHNICIAN who discovered the theft of the list sits at one end of the now-empty conference table in the communications room.  KITTRIDGE sits in a chair beside, staring gravely at him. 
He gets up and walks to the door, where HARRY BARNES hovers. KITTRIDGE lowers his voice, it's barely audible. 
KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) (to Barnes) You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened. 
BARNES What about him...? 
He gestures to the TECHNICIAN, who watches them anxiously. 
KITTRIDGE I want him manning a radar tower in Alaska by the end of the day.  Just mail him his clothes. 
He leaves.  Barnes turns to the TECHNICIAN, who looks up at him anxiously. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LONDON - NIGHT 
Night. This street is a row of nondescript hotels, one after the other, with anonymous names like "Hotel Pomeroy," "Hotel Vincent," and "Hotel Berridge." 
LONDON 
INT. LONDON SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 
This barely furnished flat is as nondescript as the row of buildings it's in.  ETHAN hurriedly digs through an overnight bag until he finds what he's looking for -- the now-battered bible he's used to contact Max.  He flips through the pages and crosses the room to his laptop, which is powered up and waiting on the tiny desk. 
LUTHER, alone in a chair across the room. is seriously preoccupied.  KRIEGER is sprawled-on a ratty sofa, hoisting a lager and watching CNN. 
CLAIRE is at the window staring out, anxious. 
KRIEGER glances over the back of the sofa at ETHAN. 
KRIEGER You contacting your buyer? (no answer) Ethan? 
From the desk, ETHAN glances up.  Then goes back to the computer.  KRIEGER continues to glare over the sofa back. 
KRIEGER (CONT'D) Ethan?  Oh, 'scuse me Mr. Hunt? 
ETHAN ignores him, working.  His computer jams with static as it connects to a BBS.  The screen blinks and displays the familiar Bible group service through which he's contacted Max.  When it asks him which chapter and verse for the posting, ETHAN flicks through the Bible, looking for the next code.  He  begins to type. 
MAX -- Now might be an excellent time to interpret Scripture face to face. Meet on TGV, noon tomorrow.  Take seat 27.  Bring our mutual friend Job. 
KRIEGER suddenly appears over his shoulder and knocks bible out of Ethan's hands to the floor. 
KRIEGER You're not going to any meeting without me. 
ETHAN My contact is extremely shy. 
He goes back to the computer, his finger hovering over the "ENTER" button. 
LUTHER and CLAIRE watch this growing conflict closely. ETHAN sighs and stands up.  KRIEGER pulls out the blue disk he took from ETHAN in the computer room and waves it in front of him. 
KRIEGER I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this. 
CLAIRE Krieger. 
KRIEGER Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue 
ETHAN Don't you mean this? 
ANCHOR The unlikely setting...a farm in the heartland of America...the State of Wisconsin, where federal agents claim to have broken the brain trust behind an international drug ring.  For a report we go live now to CNN correspondent (Joe Jones) in the state capitol, Madison. (Joe)...? 
CNN reporter speaks to camera, on the steps of a courthouse. 
REPORTER Authorities have identified the couple as Margaret Ethan Hunt and Donald Hunt. 
BACK TO SCENE 
ETHAN looks.  CLAIRE behind him. 
INSERT - SCREEN 
An OLDER COUPLE, mid-sixties, exit the doors and are led down the steps of the courthouse in shackles.  The Reporter and other news crews race up to the door. 
REPORTER Here they are now. 
Camera follows the couple downstairs.  Police roughly pull them away from the news crews. 
BACK TO SCENE 
INSERT - SCREEN 
REPORTER They were apprehended this morning by the DEA in a major sting operation for the illegal manufacture of the drug methcathinone, known on the street as "cat". 
BACK TO SCENE 
ETHAN 
INSERT - SCREEN 
VOICE (O.S.) Similar to methamphetamines, cat is seen by officials as one of the most powerful and dangerous drugs in the world.  Some thirty-four cat labs have been seized so far, but the recently widowed Mrs. Hunt and her brother-in-law are believed to be involved in a global drug distribution network. 
A public official exits the building.  The reporter and other news crews charge up to him. 
REPORTER Mr. Fairchild, agent Fairchild, a comment please. 
The image on the television changes to an interview with a PUBLIC OFFICIAL who faces a bank of microphones. 
PUBLIC OFFICIAL I think it's sad, really.  Farmers, unless they're a conglomerate, are always operating on a paper-thin margin.  I'm afraid what we have here is a case of a naive and lonely widow with a lot of financial problems who chose to make money through illegal means. 
REPORTER That was John Fairchild, the DEA agent in charge of this investigation.  Officials tell me that international law enforcement agents are expected to arrive here later today to question the Hunts. This is Joe Jones, CNN, Love in Madison, Wisconsin. 
BACK TO SCENE 
ETHAN Kittridge... 
CLAIRE Bastard! 
ETHAN switches TV off and paces away from it.  His anger erupts and he kicks the old filing cabinets, then picks up a chair and throws it across the room so it smashes into the wall.  CLAIRE tries to get hold of him, but he shakes her away. 
ETHAN Don't...don't touch me... 
CAMERA SWING PANS between them. 
CLAIRE What are you going to do? 
ETHAN (turns to her and gestures at TV) He's expecting my call. (strides to door) I'm going to the station... (o/s at door) And I'm going to call him. 
EXT. LONDON SAFE HOUSE - RAIN - NIGHT 
ETHAN comes out from a side street by Liverpool Street Underground Station and crosses the road to the main station. CLAIRE watches him from the window. 
INT. LONDON TERMINUS RAILWAY STATION - NIGHT 
ETHAN hurries down escalator.  CAMERA MOVES IN on him.  He crosses to the TELEPHONE BOXES. He starts to dial a number. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CIA - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
A light flashes and a phone BUZZES.  KITTRIDGE in shirt and tie, picks up.  BARNES and several other AGENTS are monitoring newscasts and engaged in various activities related to the Hunt case. 
KITTRIDGE (picking up) Kittridge. 
ETHAN (O.S.) I see you've been out visiting the folks. 
KITTRIDGE (covers receiver) It's Hunt.  What do you need for a pinpoint? (to Ethan) Been watching a little T.V., have you? 
PHELPS Hey, I showed 'em to you! 
ETHAN I remember.. 
PHELPS smiles warmly, has to steady himself to maintain an upright position.  He opens a medicine bottle and takes the pain killers. 
ETHAN Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight. 
PHELPS I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge. (a fist into the table) Kittridge! 
PHELPS grips the sides of the table. 
ETHAN Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole? 
PHELPS Yeah. 
ETHAN How did Kittridge do it?.. 
EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - FLASHBACK - NIGHT 
A reprise of PHELPS'S narrative only now ETHAN'S telling it and camera is showing the events as ETHAN sees they actually happened. 
ETHAN VO - first he took care of Jack in the elevator - 
At the Embassy PHELPS sends the elevator to the top of the building, watching it go and crush Kiefer. 
ETHAN VO - he shot you on the bridge - 
On the Charles bridge PHELPS using the Visco glasses aims the gun toward them, fires, cants the glasses and tosses them into the Vltava River. 
ETHAN VO - he must have had back up take out Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.. 
There on the embankment, in the night and fog, it is KRIEGER who takes out GOLITSYN and SARAH thru the fence.. 
ETHAN VO How did he do Hannah? 
Here it is CLAIRE with back to camera who presses the detonator and turns dreamily to face it, the explosion brilliant behind her... 
ETHAN VO No.  No.  He could've taken out Hannah himself. 
PHELPS presses the remote detonator and the car blows.. 
OVER SHOULDER - PHELPS (INT. RAILWAY CAFE) 
ETHAN looking intently at him. 
ETHAN Why, Jim?  Why? 
Awkward moment. 
PHELPS ..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - without your permission.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How dare he?  You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time! 
ETHAN We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us. 
PHELPS Whatís going to make him do that? 
ETHAN What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list. 
PHELPS Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you. 
ETHAN A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris. 
PHELPS Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus. 
ETHAN If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris. 
PHELPS looks away.  Seems badly shaken. 
ETHAN Jim...? 
PHELPS I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I.. 
PHELPS breaks off abruptly.  Apparently some inner struggle over this threatens to overwhelm him.  Then, controlling it: 
PHELPS - no.  She canít know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too much at stake, Ethan. 
ETHAN Youíre probably right. 
A MAN puts a cellular phone and a radio/cassette machine on the bunk-bed.  We only see his hands as he proceeds to take the parts of a pistol out of the cassette machine and assemble a wicked-looking pistol from the seemingly innocuous electrical parts inside. 
INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - DAY 
MAX is reading the Financial Times.  MATTHIAS is looking out of the window.  A cellular phone rings inside MAXís briefcase in front of MATTHIAS.  MATTHIAS takes the phone out. 
MATTHIAS Yes... (holds phone out for Max) Itís him. 
MAX (into phone) This wasnít what we discussed. 
ETHAN (O.S.) (on phone) My apologies Max.  Couldnít be helped. Thereís a piece of black cloth under your seat.  Tear it away and youíll find the disk. 
MAX reaches down and does as instructed, finding the computer disk as promised.  She hands it to Matthias who strips off the velcro covering and slots it into the drive next to the computer in the briefcase.  He boots it up quickly and turns the briefcase containing the computer toward MAX for her to see. 
One half of the screen, with the heading "CRYPTONYM AND OPERATIONAL SPECS" is already jammed with information.  The blank second half of the screen acquires the title "TRUE NAME," and information starts filling itself in rapidly -- names, addresses, identities. 
As the two sides match up, a legend flashes: 
IDENTITY MATCH 
MAX (back into phone) Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private. 
ETHAN (O.S.) It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is. 
MAX The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314. 
ETHAN (O.S.) What about Job? 
MAX I wouldnít worry about him.  Once youíve got the money -- heíll find you. 
INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING (ANOTHER ANGLE) 
LUTHER, three rows behind in another seat, is at work on a laptop of his own.  A mobile Nokia phone is beside it - red light flashing. 
INT. SECOND CLASS CAR - MOVING (ANOTHER ANGLE) - DAY 
KITTRIDGE and BARNES move through the second class car.  They turn around and start working their way back again. 
At the front, CLAIRE is getting desperate.  A LARGE MAN passes through the door behind her. 
The LARGE MAN continues back, nearing KITTRIDGE and BARNES, who are forced to step into empty seats on the side in order to make room for him to pass.  As they move by him, their vision is momentarily blocked -- 
-- and CLAIRE gets up to follow. 
She follows to the rear of the car and she passes through the door and out of the car, after KITTRIDGE and BARNES talk in doorway. 
BARNES Only four more cars. 
KITTRIDGE And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again. 
BARNES Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV? 
KITTRIDGE High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max. 
BARNES But why tell us? 
KITTRIDGE Heís putting on a show, Barnes. 
BARNES What kind of show. 
KITTRIDGE I donít know. (looks at his wrist monitor) It didnít say on the tickets. 
KITTRIDGE and BARNES go off back through the next coach. CLAIRE follows into the same doorway and stops to speak into her wristwatch to ETHAN: 
CLAIRE Ethan...Kittridge is on the train. 
ETHAN Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther? 
CLAIRE Two cars.  Where are you? 
ETHAN You are my eyes.  Stay with him. 
She moves onto the next coach, going after KITTRIDGE and BARNES. 
INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - (MAX) - DAY 
On her computer screen in the business car, an ominous message flashes. 
A cable and hook swing down from the helicopter, almost touching the roof of the train. PHELPS crawls closer to it. 
ETHAN, behind him, is in a far more precarious position. Without goggles or suction cups, he has to use his fingers to grab small holes on the roof. 
He is flipped over by the wind, ending up facing the other way.  Loses his grip and is blown backwards over the roof. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY 
KRIEGER sees the Chunnel entrance approaching.  He gestures to PHELPS and tries to move the cable closer to him, passing over PHELPS and then back to him. 
EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY 
PHELPS grabs the cable and is about to hook the cable onto his belt, ETHAN slides into him and they both crash onto the roof. 
ETHAN grabs the cable out of PHELPS hand and clips it onto the roof. 
PHELPS and ETHAN struggle, but they are hurtling dangerously closer to the chunnel entrance. 
They're now right on top of the chunnel entrance. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY 
KRIEGER sees the tunnel, only seconds away now.  He paws at the controls, jerking back desperately on a certain lever. 
EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY 
PHELPS kicks ETHAN and he falls off the far side of the train.  PHELPS falls off the near side and holding onto the strap manages to pull himself back on. 
-- The train ZOOMS into the tunnel -- 
-- AND THE HELICOPTER ROARS RIGHT IN BEHIND IT! 
INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAY 
As the train roars into the tunnel, the business car goes nearly dark and the message on MAX'S computer screen changes one last time.  This time it says: 
CONNECTION TERMINATED. TRANSFER LOST. 
MAX'S face falls. 
MAX Damn! 
INT. REAR CAR/ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAY 
Another CONDUCTOR races into the power car, past his inert companion, and is shocked to see the copter right behind the train.  He grabs a radio and SCREAMS into it. 
CONDUCTOR No, no, it's IN the tunnel! 
VOICE (O.S.) Stop the train! 
CONDUCTOR It'll crash into us!  Accelerate, accelerate. 
EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY 
For a moment, we see no one.  No ETHAN.  No PHELPS.  Moving around to the other end of the car, we see where they've gone. 
They're dangling from either side of it. 
PHELPS paws for one of the suction cups and pulls himself back onto the roof of the train.  ETHAN reaches for the other cup. 
The helicopter, fortunate that this tunnel is double track and barely wide enough to accomodate it, pursues, KRIEGER pushing it up to full speed again. 
But it can't lift up high enough to go completely over the train. 
EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY 
PHELPS, nearing the back, manoeuvers himself to the windshield of the rear power car, trying to grab the skid of KRIEGER'S copter. 
He doesn't see what's headed toward him, coming from the other direction. 
Another train. 
At the last moment, PHELPS notices the reflection of the oncoming train in the windshield and swings back onto the roof of his train, barely avoiding getting creamed by it as it blows by. 
The helicopter avoids the oncoming train too -- and PHELPS misses the skid. 
KRIEGER tips the front of the copter, trying to decapitate ETHAN with the rotor.  PHELPS jumps onto the skid, but the copter pitches so far forward the blade hits the top of the tunnel.  SPARKS and chunks of cement fly.

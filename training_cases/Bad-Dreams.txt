BAD DREAMS

FADE IN: 
1   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - SUNSET                                         1 A serene landscape, mist collecting as the red ball of a sun dips behind the mountains. 
In the middle of a field stands a bare-chested man facing the sunset. He is HARRIS, forty-ish, greying but handsome, and very fit. His hands are outstretched as if embracing an invisible entity. He seems filled with some sort of transcendental power. Now, an air of fulfillment and resolve settles over him. He turns and walks away from us. CAMERA ADJUSTS and reveals-- 
2   EXT. UNITY HOUSE - LONG SHOT - SUNSET                             2 Once the home of Victorian Gentry, a few seasons of amateur repair work have not compensated for decades of neglect. But now as Harris walks towards it, the fading daylight and long shadows turn it into a fantasy castle. MUSIC ECHOES faintly from within; it's "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" by Iron Butterfly. If the music didn't place the era for us, the battered VW MINIBUS parked outside the house does; it's covered with flower paintings, slogans, and the ubiquitous peace sign. 
As Harris approaches the house, a dozen or so YOUNG PEOPLE rush to greet him and embrace him. Extending his arms out to enclose them all, he goes inside. 
3   INT. COMMON ROOM - SUNSET                                         3 This was probably a stately parlor in its day. There is a funky assembly of odd handmade furniture. There are muslin curtains on the windows, crude paintings, and quilts covering ripped chairs and couches. Despite the squalor, there is a neatness to the place. Now, the CAMERA begins to ROAM through the room and down the hallways lined with fading wallpaper. 
VOICES (various) --where did she go...? ... was here a moment ago... Cynthia, come on, honey, we need you... Cynthia, come out, come out wherever you are... the sun's going down, we're losing the moment...! (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED:             VOICES(CONT'D) Hey, mellow out, we got ten minutes, I like, checked the almanac, okay...? Ready or not, here we come... 
All these comments are made in relaxed and good natured tones. Finally the CAMERA PANS OVER to a little storage alcove beneath the servant's stairway. A HAND reaches in and opens the door, and inside we SEE cartons, antique toys... and then CYNTHIA, a pretty 13 year old girl who wears funky clothing and a haunted, nervous expression. 
VOICES (CONT'D) ...There you are, you naughty girl! You almost made us lose the sunset... Come on, honey, time's wasting... 
She shrinks back from the HANDS that are pulling her up and out, but they prevail, and she's up and on unsteady feet. The CAMERA stays with her as she's led back down the hallway. 
CYNTHIA (faintly) No, please... I... I really don't want to do this... Can't I just wait for you..? I--I'm not sure about this-- 
A SET OF HANDS moves in, separates Cynthia from the others. 
4   NEW ANGLE                                                        4 Revealing VICTOR, a handsome youth a few years older than Cynthia. 
VICTOR Easy, Cyn, easy. You don't want to do this, that's okay... right, Harris? 
The VOICES stop as everyone awaits an answer. CAMERA PANS across the common room, to the end we haven't seen yet. 
In the center of the room is a big cistern or font. As we watch, Harris has just DUNKED someone in it. The person steps out, laughing, sloshing in amber liquid. Standing around are other people, some already dripping wet, others awaiting their turns. Some are clothed and wet, others in varying degrees of undress. It all seems slightly off, slightly eerie, despite their smiles and cheer. Harris splashes himself with the amber liquid from the tub, pushes his hair back. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
HARRIS No, Victor, it's not okay. Here at Unity House, some things have to be done... (slight smile) ...in Unity. This is one of them. 
He WADES CLOSER to the CAMERA, within reach of Cynthia, Victor and the others. Smiles again. It's the kind of a smile that inspires trust. 
HARRIS (CONT'D) Cynthia, do you trust me? 
She nods immediately. 
HARRIS (CONT'D) And have I ever lied to you? 
She shakes her head. He GESTURES. The people around Cynthia begin to GET INTO the tub. Some remove their clothing; others get in clothes and all. Toddlers and infants are held by their parents and playfully splashed. 
HARRIS (CONT'D) Then I say to you now... to all of you now... that this will be the Ultimate Joining... of man and woman... parent and child... humanity and Godhead. 
He looks at Victor, who reluctantly lets Cynthia's hand go, gets in. Now only Cynthia remains. 
HARRIS (CONT'D) Cynthia. Come. There is no shame in this. No crime. No sin. Just the final break with the old world... As night falls, we start a new day... a day of Unity. (a command, but warm) Come to me... my lovechild. 
5   ON CYNTHIA                                                     5 His last words melt her remaining resistance. Moving like a sleepwalker, she steps into the tub, wades forward. Then she stops, looks down at the fluid lapping at her jeans... runs her hand through it. Her eyes widen. 
6   EXT. HOUSE - LONG SHOT                                             6 The sun almost gone now, red light reflecting on the gabled windows. Even the battered VW van looks good in this setting. It's beautiful. 
CYNTHIA'S VOICE No!   No... 
HARRIS' VOICE Cynthia, come back! We can't do it without you... We must have unity, my lovechild... Unity, now and through eternity... Cynthia, you cannot run... You belong to us forever--! 
Pause. The faint SOUNDS of SPLASHING and then FOOTSTEPS skittering on tired wooden floors... and then-- 
--UNITY HOUSE EXPLODES! 
7   EXPLOSION - ANOTHER ANGLE                                          7 WINDOWS blow out. Splintered BEAMS propeller through the air. The VW camper on the lawn ROCKS with the shock wave. Then a SECOND EXPLOSION blows the Victorian cupolas and widow's walk off the roof. From somewhere in the distance we HEAR SIRENS... 
CUT TO: 
8   EXT. UNITY HOUSE - NIGHT                                           8 FIRE is CONSUMING what's left of the building. Rescue workers and firefighters are running back and forth. 
9   INSPECTOR WASSERMAN                                                9 A plainclothes detective, he NODS to some uniforms, steps around some debris to move closer to the scene. He puts his collar up against the SPRAY which leaks from firehose connections. Seeing one of his men, he SHOUTS over the din. 
We FOLLOW the young nurse as she goes into-- 
16   CYNTHIA'S ROOM                                                  16 Bored, the nurse goes to the foot of the bad, checks the chart there. She moves past MONITORING EQUIPMENT which shows only subtle movement. As she begins to take Cynthia's blood pressure, CAMERA CONTINUES ON INTO THE BED and we see Cynthia, 
She is now a fully grown young woman in her late 20's.   She is curled up in a fetal ball. 
17   THE YOUNG NURSE                                                 17 finishes her work and then gathers some bottles from the side table. She goes to the door and then REACTS to a SOUND. 
She looks around, puzzled. Meanwhile, we SEE (and she DOESN'T) that there is INCREASED ACTIVITY on the monitors. 
CYNTHIA (faint, weak) No... no... it's wrong... someone... please help... 
YOUNG NURSE Holy shit... 
Stunned, the nurse DROPS the bottles with a CRASH. Recovering her composure, she darts back to the bed, watches flabbergasted as Cynthia continues to STIR, her arms weakly battling half-realized fears. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: The young nurse hits an ALARM, grabs Cynthia's arms to prevent her from pitching out of the bed, and then DOCTORS and NURSES are scrambling all over the room, and as the DIN RISES we 
CUT TO: 
18   INT. HOSPITAL PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY                                18 FLASHBULBS pop and the HOSPITAL SPOKESMAN grins clumsily, famous for fifteen minutes. 
There's eight or nine reporters here, all of them wishing they were on bigger stories. 
SPOKESMAN (in mid speech) Twelve years, two months...   nine days. 
FIRST REPORTER Is that like a world record for a coma or something? 
SPOKESMAN Actually, no. The longest one on record is 37 years. 
The first reporter closes a notebook, leaves. 
SECOND REPORTER Does she remember anything about the fire at Universe House? 
19   NEW ANGLE - SHOWING THE BACK OF THE ROOM                            19 Lieutenant (n√©e Inspector) Wasserman is there.    He's grayer, paunchier, but the raincoat is the same one. 
SPOKESMAN'S VOICE (correcting) Unity House. No, she appears to have no memory of the accident itself or the days leading up to it. It's not uncommon after serious trauma. 
THIRD REPORTER What happens to her now? Have her family or friends been notified? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
SPOKESMAN We stopped looking for any family ton years ago.. Right now we"re planning to transfer Cynthia to Dr. S.A. Berrisford's Neuropsychiatric Clinic. It's right here on our grounds, and Dr. Berrisford is familiar with both the neuromuscular problems a patient like this will encounter as well as the inevitable mental readjustment that will be required. Thank you. 
The reporters filter out. 
Wasserman is already gone. 
CUT TO: 
20   FOOT                                                                  20 as it is clumsily set down...    another FOOT slides forward. 
21   INT. THERAPY ROOM - WIDER                                             21 Cynthia is standing inside a set of parallel bars. She's pale, weak looking. A PHYSICAL THERAPIST is at her elbow, egging her on. 
THERAPIST Good... Very good... Come on, just a few more steps... 
Cynthia blinks, as if just processing the therapist's word takes some adjustment. 
CYNTHIA (weary) I... I can't... I have to rest... 
BERRISFORD'S VOICE Young lady, you've had fifteen years of rest. 
CAMERA ADJUSTS to show DR. BERRISFORD. In his 50's, avuncular, he wears half-framed glasses and a sweater vest under his medical coat. Two pieces of tissue paper mark his razor's passage on his neck. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
BERRISFORD (CONT'D) Now walk to the end of that platform, or you won't got any chocolate ice cream. 
Something about Berrisford's mock-stern tone bores in on Cynthia, gets a reaction. She gropes for an answer. 
CYNTHIA (finally) I... I hate chocolate ice cream. 
BERRISFORD Then walk to the end of the platform, or I'll shove an entire gallon down your throat. 
Cynthia's eyes crinkle with confusion. And then, ah, she gets it! A joke, the first one in over a decade. She SMILES, and it's a beautiful smile. Setting her jaw, she makes a renewed effort and reaches the and of the platform. The therapist and Berrisford both move quickly to catch her and set her down in a wheelchair. 
BERRISFORD (to the therapist) That'll be all. 
Berrisford begins wheeling Cynthia along. They leave the therapy room, go down a corridor. (Note: Passage as per location.) As they go by other patients and staff, there's a general BUZZ as people whisper about Cynthia. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
CYNTHIA I remember... a beautiful sunset. Harris, smiling at me... 
WASSERMAN (writing) Harris, he was the leader? 
Cynthia's eyes are far away.    The memories come back...   the words are slow, but vivid. 
CYNTHIA Leader, founder... chief cook and bottlewasher... (smiling) Executive in charge of Dreaming. We were all together... all working to make a now world... That last night, there was a... (brow furrowing) Gathering... a... a sort of... baptism... And then... 
She winces, rubs her eyes. 
CYNTHIA (CONT'D) I'm sorry, that's all I can see. 
WASSERMAN Miss Weston. This "Unity House"... was it a cult? 
CYNTHIA I'm sorry.     I don't understand the question. 
BERRISFORD A "cult," Cynthia. A syndrome of society you have been fortunate enough to miss. They're popular with impressionable people, the penny press... (pause) ...and lazy policemen who like to blame them for crimes they can't solve. 
Wasserman closes his notebook, gives Berrisford a cold stare. 
WASSERMAN I was there that night, Doctor. I watched them stack those bodies... (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4)      WASSERMAN(CONT'D) men, women, children. They looked like 2,000 year old mummies. They broke apart like 2,000 year old mummies. 
Cynthia gasps. 
WASSERMAN (CONT'D) If it was an accident... fine. If it wasn't... the person responsible could still be out there. (pause) And he's probably as interested in Miss Weston's memory as I am. 
He turns, nods to Cynthia. 
WASSERMAN (CONT'D) Feel better. 
He goes out.   Cynthia's breath comes in short gasps.   Finally she calms. 
CYNTHIA I don't like that man. 
BERRISFORD That makes two of us. 
He sits beside her again. 
BERRISFORD (CONT'D) But as long as you're here... (smiling) I can keep him away. 
CAMERA TIGHTENS on Cynthia as she considers this... 
CUT TO: 
26   INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY                                           26 The room is cheery, commands a view of the city. A VIDEO CAMERA sits unobtrusively in one corner. Six people sit in chairs in various stages of interest and/or boredom. 
They are MIRIAM, an attractive woman in her forties, who chain-smokes designer cigarettes; 
CONNIE, smiling, chipper; 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ED, overweight, friendly; 
LANA, pale, worried looking; 
and GILDA, tiny, frightened, withdrawn. She sits with feet pulled up on her chair, arms wrapped around her knees. 
CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Cynthia driving her electric wheelchair into the room and into a place in the circle. 
RALPH stands. Long-haired, with the staccato delivery of a stand-up comic, he smiles. 
RALPH Well, now that we're all here, we can begin. Cynthia, I'm Dr. Goldman, and I'd like to welcome you to our little group. I don't know how much my colleague Dr. Berrisford has told you about my methods. I have my detractors... but I have my successes, too! We're going to get you out of your depression... We're going to got you out of your neurosises... We're going to got you out of that hideous hospital robe and into a flimsy revealing negligee--one with the little holes here? I can see us now on a desert island... You, me, a portable waterbed-- 
As Cynthia's eyes widen, DR. ALAN GOLDMAN comes into the room, sighs with weary familiarity at Ralph's antics. (Actually, Alan doesn't look much more like a doctor than Ralph.) 
ALAN Ralph, sit down and cut out the shit, okay? 
RALPH Dr. Goldman, I was on the verge of a major breakthrough, and you blew it! 
ALAN Ralph? (when he sits) Cynthia. I'm Doctor Goldman--at least, last time I checked... (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2)      ALAN(CONT'D) and I doubt if my welcome can equal Ralph's, but I'll try. This is the Borderline Personality Group. And you are now a card-carrying member. 
CYNTHIA What's a borderline personality? 
ALAN Gilda hasn't said three words in three weeks. And now, Cynthia comes in with this love, peace and Woodstock routine and... presto. Am I missing something, or what? 
BERRISFORD She's espousing a total belief system. A kind of holistic healing matrix not unlike the dynamic energy shift model. Isn't that interesting? They're adopting it, embracing it. 
ALAN Too bad we can't follow through on this. 
BERRISFORD Why not? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ALAN Dr. Berrisford, the people in this group... some of them are deeply disturbed. Cynthia doesn't belong with them-- an experiment for one session, fine, but in the long run-- 
BERRISFORD Alan. We've opened primary channels of communication. You've opened them, Alan. Let's not rush to throw away our progress. Neuroses are hardly contagious. A few weeks in the group won't hurt Cynthia. With luck, she'll overcome her memory trauma. That would mean progress... not to Mention getting Lieutenant Wasserman off my back. In the meantime... 
He stands, puts his hand on the younger man's shoulder. 
BERRISFORD (CONT'D) She seems to like you. See if you can get her to open up, and let's press on. (pause) With a united front? 
ALAN A united front.   Sure. 
Satisfied, Berrisford smiles, goes out the door.     Alan sighs, and looks at Cynthia's image on the screen. 
CUT TO: 
29   INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - DAY                                   29 Patients in different stages of fitness use the equipment, some with supervision, others on their own. HETTIE, Berrisford's chief nurse--a Selma Diamond type--comes in with a tray of medication in paper cups. She works her way over to where 
30   CYNTHIA                                                            30 is doing log lifts on a bench. She's in a leotard and leg warmers, and there's real color in her face for the first time. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
HETTIE Drop down to first gear, honey. It's Miller time. 
She fumbles on her tray for the cup marked "Weston," hands the pills to Cynthia along with a cup of juice. 
CYNTHIA What are these? Vitamins? 
HETTIE Beauty secrets from the orient. Look what they've done for me. 
Cynthia laughs, takes the pills. Hettie moves over to Ralph, who's just finished doing bench presses. 
HETTIE Ralph, you in a cooperative mood, or do I have to tie you up again? 
RALPH Promises, promises. 
He takes the pills she gives him, smiles.      She just looks at him, taps his mouth. 
HETTIE Open. 
Of course the pills are still under his tongue. Hettie gives him a shot in the solar plexus and he GULPS. Hettie hands him the juice. 
HETTIE (CONT'D) Next time I hit lower. 
She moves on to other patients.     Ralph moves over to Cynthia. 
RALPH She's crazy about me. (watching Cynthia's workout) You're coming along. A regular Rocky. 
CYNTHIA Rocky?   The flying squirrel? 
RALPH Rocky the fighting Stallone. (on her blank look) (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2)      RALPH(CONT'D) I keep forgetting you just left the Twilight Zone. Hey, why don't you come up to my room, and I'll bring you up to date. I've got a VHS VCR, a CD, and MTV. 
CYNTHIA You're making this up...      aren't you? 
He just grins. She slips down to the floor, does some stretching exercises. 
CYNTHIA (CONT'D) Sounds like a complicated world. How do you handle it? 
RALPH Well, whenever it gets to be too much, I just let all of the negative stuff out of my body. 
CYNTHIA You mean with meditation, yoga, what? 
RALPH Nah. I just make a little hole and let it all escape. 
He pulls open his shirt. On his chest and arms are dozens of scars in neat little rows. 
Cynthia swallows, stunned.      Nonplussed, Ralph buttons back up. 
RALPH (CONT'D) Uh-uh, here comes the assistant Ayatollah. See ya. 
46   EXT. VICTOR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                   46 It's a tacky but cozy building, circa 1958. "Zeke" pulls up, rattling to a coughing halt. They get out, head up the steps. 
47   INT. VICTOR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                   47 They come in, turning on lights. It's a dingy couple of rooms, but lush with its variety of objects. Everything looks like it came from the Age of Aquarius: beanbag furniture, paper "Tiffany" shades on hanging lights, blacklight posters, hanging macrame planters. 
Cynthia loves the room and everything in it. But she is particularly drawn to a canvas on an easel in the far corner. 
48   PAINTING - HER POV                                                48 It's of her, sitting serenely in a meadow, the Unity House perched prominently on a hill in the distance. (In the doorway, the bare-chested FIGURE of a man may--or may not--be barely visible.) Cynthia's clothes in the painting are the ones she wore in the opening scene. 
But her face is that of today's Cynthia. 
49   BACK TO SCENE                                                     49 VICTOR I... did it by memory. I tried to imagine... what you'd... look like today. Guess I came pretty close. 
CYNTHIA It's beautiful. More beautiful than I ever was. 
VICTOR (softly) Then you need a new mirror. 
she smiles, flattered.    Suddenly a CAT jumps up on a crate. 
VICTOR (CONT'D) That's Chairman Meow. 
Cynthia picks him up.    Victor takes out a bottle of tequila and two glasses. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
CYNTHIA You still haven't told me how you lived. I really can't remember anything about the... accident. 
VICTOR It wasn't an accident. 
She stiffens.    His eyes are far away. 
VICTOR (CONT'D) A lot of people back then, they hated Unity House. Hated Harris and his dreams... dreams of peace... of oneness. That hate fed negative energy into the cosmic vortex... Something bad was bound to happen. That hate was so strong... so envious of what we had... 
He has SQUEEZED the shot glass in his hand so hard that it EXPLODES. Cynthia JUMPS, and that's when he notices it. 
VICTOR (CONT'D) (very normal) Oh, fuck-- 
CYNTHIA You've cut yourself-- 
She comes over, binds his hand with a dishcloth.     He holds onto her. 
VICTOR I guess talking about the past can be a little dangerous. 
He pours a shot into the remaining glass. 
VICTOR (CONT'D) Let's drink to the present. (pause) To us. 
He SIPS.   Passes the glass to her. 
50   CYNTHIA                                                            50 She hesitates...    smiles.   Drinks. 
There is a drop of blood in the glass.     She doesn't see it. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
CYNTHIA To us. 
51   BACK TO SCENE                                                      51 VICTOR (quietly) To... Unity. 
He pulls her close. They KISS... she seems to malt in his grasp. The cat jumps down. Slowly they kiss and touch each other. They stop and stare into each other's eyes. 
He moves his hand over her shoulders, neck, through her hair. She is completely his. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
52   INT. BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT                                    52 Half a dozen candles illuminate the room. 
Cynthia and Victor are making love. Not violent, but slow, passionate, dreamlike. They are completely enjoying each other. The satisfaction seems spiritual. They stare into each other's eyes the entire time. They are lost. 
Gradually Victor's rhythm builds. As his momentum increases, as the ecstasy nears, Cynthia accelerates too. Heaving, gasping, they are approaching a beautiful climax. 
But just when it seems Victor is on the verge, the very threshold, he stops and JUMPS violently out of bed. 
VICTOR Oh Jesus! 
CYNTHIA Victor? 
Victor paces around the room, practically bouncing off the walls. 
VICTOR Oh, my God. I can't believe it. What a great idea...! Too amazing! Too amazing! 
VICTOR Yeah, oh yeah...     oh, YEAH-- 
A SHOT sounds.   She SCREAMS-- 
CUT TO: 
53   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                                53 Cynthia BOLTS up out of bed. 
CYNTHIA No! 
The candles are out.    Victor isn't in the room. 
Cynthia, drenched with sweat, slowly catches her breath.      She looks around, confused. 
CYNTHIA (CONT'D) Vic? 
She goes into the other room. 
54   INT. LIVING ROOM                                                    54 No Vic. It is dark except for a FIRE in the fireplace. The flames REFLECT oddly on the slick surface of the oil painting of Unity House. 
CYNTHIA Vic? 
She checks in the kitchen. Nothing.       She looks back in the bedroom. The apartment is empty. 
She's just calming when--MEEOW! The CAT LEAPS out of nowhere, startling her, and then running out of sight. 
She swallows. Very nervous now, she sits on the couch and starts pulling on her jeans and shoes. The CAMERA MOVES AROUND her, revealing the entire apartment. We see EVERY ANGLE. It is completely quiet and still. The CAMERA SETTLES at one ANGLE on Cynthia. A shadow behind her MOVES. 
VICTOR Where are you going? 
Cynthia JUMPS from fright. 
CYNTHIA Jesus, Vic. I thought you... left. 
VICTOR Me?    Leave you all alone? 
He pulls her into his arms.      She hesitates. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
CYNTHIA Vic?   Vic, are you... happy? 
VICTOR That... (kissing her) ...has to be.. (kissing again) ...the stupidest question I ever heard... 
He keeps kissing, caressing. 
CYNTHIA I mean... with... life.   With... being alive. 
He looks at her oddly. 
VICTOR What are you talking about? 
CYNTHIA (relaxing) Never mind... I had this... bizarre dream... 
VICTOR Welcome to reality. 
He touches her soft face. He runs his hands down her neck. They kiss again, she now completely without reservation. Their embrace is so all-encompassing that, when she opens her eyes, it's only then that she SEES 
55   CLOSER                                                             55 She is kissing a BURNED AND SCARRED FACE WITH ONLY CLUMPS OF PUPPY BLACK MUSCLE HANGING ON THE BONE. It is Harris' face, the face we saw in the elevator. Cynthia GASPS, fumbles backwards off of the sofa. 
VICTOR (CONT'D) What's the matter? 
She looks back up at him.     He's Victor again, normal again. 
VICTOR (CONT'D) Cynthia? 
She knocks over a tequila bottle. It's spilled all over the floor. She is speechless. He picks the bottle up. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
VICTOR (CONT'D) Why did you pull away? 
CYNTHIA I...    I think I'd better go. 
VICTOR Why? 
She's over by the door.    Victor comes and presses against it so she can't get out. 
CYNTHIA Please let me out.

ALAN Cynthia, a double closet isn't exactly a positive I.D.-- 
MANAGER What are you two talking about? You wanna rent, or what? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Cynthia looks around, suddenly points to a stain on the rug, triumphant. 
CYNTHIA There! There, look--that's where I spilled the tequila... (on her knees, desperate) See? See? It's still wet! 
MANAGER (apologetic) Hon, I think that's from the ceiling... 
CAMERA TILTS UP. There is, indeed, a corresponding damp spot directly above the one on the rug. As we WATCH a DRIP plops down. 
MANAGER (CONT'D) ...damn plumber was supposed to fix it last week. (smiling) So! We in business?

70   INT. BERRISFORD'S OFFICE - DAY                                      70 Wasserman SLAMS his hand down on the desk, furious. Cynthia JUMPS, squeezes Alan's hand. Berrisford sits quietly, leans forward and picks up the pan holder Wasserman has displaced. 
WASSERMAN Twelve hours! You wait twelve hours to tell me about this? Am I supposed to be grateful for your civic-mindedness? I told you the Unity House case was still open-- (pointing at Cynthia) --and she's the only lead. You should have called me the minute you found out-- 
BERRISFORD (calmly) Found out what? Lieutenant, if I called the police every time one of my patients experienced a fantasy or a delusion, you'd have to move in here-- 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
CYNTHIA (sharp, stepping forward) It was not a delusion! Victor Lunes was here-- 
BERRISFORD The security guard didn't see anyone-- 
CYNTHIA Then the security guard needs glasses! Alan, tell them-- 
ALAN (on the spot) The apartment did match her general description-- 
WASSERMAN --a one bedroom flat with a beige rug... that's rather... generic. 
CYNTHIA --Victor isn't generic-- 
WASSERMAN Victor is dead! Dead for fifteen years-- 
CYNTHIA --you've seen his body? 
WASSERMAN --it was burned beyond recognition-- but there was I.D.-- 
CYNTHIA I knew it--I knew it- 
ALAN Cynthia. Look... we've all done it... tumbled out of bed positive that we've just lived something that was only a dream-- 
CYNTHIA (firmly) Damn it, it wasn't a dream--I was out there-- 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
WASSERMAN No one's denying you flow the coop, Miss Weston... You wanna prove the rest? Lemme get a policewoman to stand by while a gynecologist checks out your plumbing. We'll see soon enough if your ghost left a calling card-- 
Cynthia hauls off and gives Wasserman a tremendous SLAP. 
CYNTHIA You bastard. 
She goes to the door, looks at the doctors. 
CYNTHIA (CONT'D) You... (searching) --experts! 
She goes out, SLAMS the door.    Wasserman rubs his jaw, checks his mouth. 
BERRISFORD Wonderful! Wonderful! I've been waiting and waiting for her to finally show real anger--real emotion! This could be a breakthrough! (sincere) Thank you, Lieutenant. 
Wasserman holds a filling in his fingertips. 
WASSERMAN Hey.   Anytime.

INT. THERAPY ROOM - DAY 
CAMERA PANS past a row of PILLOWS. We WIDEN, see that each member of the group has a big pillow in front of them. 
SNAP.   Drip. 
HARRIS (CONT'D) ...You have no choice... 
He takes the match and strikes it through the pile of nails. 
The nails scatter. 
HARRIS (CONT'D) ...Come to us, Cynthia. It's time to die. Don't lot another take your place. Come to us... now. 
The match is lit.    He throws it off. 
76    SLOW MOTION                                                     76 It FALLS through the air. Lands on the soaked carpet.   An EXPLOSION of flames. They RUSH TOWARDS CYNTHIA-- 
CYNTHIA NOOOOOOOOO--! 
It is a blood-curdling and heart-stopping a scream as ever heard. 
There is a FLASH of light.

The Unity House Members and Harris are all gone. 
The group therapy people all turn to her in amazement. 
77A   MIRIAM                                                            77A Open mouthed, she DROPS the match she's holding to light a cigarette. It SIZZLES on the rug. Alan STOMPS it out, rushes over to Cynthia, who SAGS in his arms, 
CUT TO: 
77B   INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - DAY                                          77B Cynthia sits in a crumpled sprawl in Alan's office. The room is decorated in comforting tones, with Sierra Club posters and outdoors-y souvenirs. The late afternoon sun steams in through the partially closed blinds. 
Alan sits beside Cynthia on the couch, concerned.   Berrisford sucks on his pipe, makes notes. 
Wasserman, rocking on the legs of his chair, jots in his own little notebook. 
CYNTHIA (softly, tense) ...They... they sang songs as they stacked up the white containers... they were... happy. Because it was going to be their break with the world... a world that didn't understand them. I don't remember if they took a vote or if Harris just... decided. But they all agreed. They were... happy... smiling... laughing... crying from happiness as he drenched them in the gasoline... 
WASSERMAN (under his breath) --Jesus-- 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
CYNTHIA Somehow, I... I knew it was wrong... I ran... When he threw the match, I was at the other end of the hallway... There was a flash... and a... like a wind, or the hand of God--picked me up, threw me... The ceiling fell in... When I opened my eyes... (she looks up) I was here. 
Hettie appears in the doorway, tray in hand, raises her eyebrows inquisitively at Alan. Alan nods immediately: Hell, yes. Hettie comes in, gives Cynthia her medication. 
Wasserman closes his book, looks thoughtful. 
ALAN (to Wasserman) If that's what happened, why didn't you find any evidence of arson? 
WASSERMAN The plastic jerry cans would've burned up before anything else... We knew there'd been an explosion... We just didn't know how or why. 
Berrisford stands, approaches Wasserman as the police officer closes his book, moves to the doorway. 
BERRISFORD Well. You must be pleased. Closing a case after... what is it, twelve years? 
WASSERMAN Who says it's closed? 
The medical people look at him.      Cynthia's thoughts are elsewhere. 
ALAN What's that supposed to mean? 
WASSERMAN When the fairy princess here woke up, she said she didn't remember anything about 32 deaths. Now she remembers they committed suicide... (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2)      WASSERMAN(CONT'D) but she, of course, was innocent. Who knows what she'll remember tomorrow? Running for help... or pouring gasoline on the fire? 
He goes out. 
HETTIE That man's a candidate for shock therapy... with a car battery right to the cojones. 
CYNTHIA No... he's right.     I am guilty. 
They look at her, startled. 
CYNTHIA (CONT'D) I'm guilty of lying... to Unity House. I promised to be part of it... Forever. They expected me to keep my word. (pause) They still do. 
She stands, goes out. Alan and Hettie look worried. Berrisford looks... unsurprised. He turns to Alan. 
He yanks her up again, but it's not Cynthia. It's LANA. Before she can catch her breath, she's plunged back down. 
80C   LANA - CLOSER                                                      80C She's yanked up, but this time she's not in the pond, she's in that gasoline-filled cistern! 
HARRIS (CONT'D) Cleanse the spirit of the body! 
He holds her under. She starts to move her arms around to grab hold of something to pull herself up, but Harris is too strong. She flails around desperately. 
80D   CYNTHIA                                                            80D Alarmed, she moves forward-- 
80E   WITH LANA - UNDER WATER                                            80E HARRIS (CONT'D) (distant) Cleanse the spirit. 
Lana's gasping, inhaling water, turning blue.    Harris is possessed. 
HARRIS (CONT'D) Cleanse. 
Her movements slow.   Her eyes close.   She is completely still. 
80F   HARRIS - CLOSE                                                     80F He looks directly at Cynthia. 
HARRIS (CONT'D) I warned you, Cynthia. I warned you someone else would take your place. 
80G   UNDER WATER AGAIN                                                  80G His HAND withdraws from Lana. Her eyes OPEN. No life there. SHE FLOATS UPWARDS. THE CAMERA BREAKS THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WITH HER.

We're in the clinic's swimming pool! On the edge of the pool, Cynthia SCREAMS, drops to her knees in horror. 
80H   OTHER END OF BUILDING                                             80H The clinic CUSTODIAN and some staff run into the room.

Cynthia flails on the bed, already reacting to the sedative qualities of the drug. 
CYNTHIA --He killed her--he killed her because I broke my word... He said he'd take someone else, and he did... She wanted my help... my friendship... That's why... he took her... 
She's out cold. Behind the doctors, in the doorway, the other clinic patients press close, curious. Hettie pushes them out and down the hallway. 
HETTIE Move it, people, this ain't a sideshow... Get back to your rooms... 
Alan looks down at Cynthia with genuine concern.    But Berrisford eyes her totally clinically. 
BERRISFORD (thinking aloud) Fascinating. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED:             BERRISFORD(CONT'D) She's a textbook specimen from a collective environment, an immersion philosophy, run by an extremely manipulative figurehead with Messianic delusions. Unity House at its apex must have been a classic matrix of belief impression overlaid on collectivity-- (exciting himself) That would indicate she's symptomatic of a hypothetical Borderline Personality syndrome among cult followers, all externalizing their anxiety! (turning) What do you think? 
Alan looks at him disbelievingly. 
ALAN (exploding) I think she's fucking freaked out about Lana! 
BERRISFORD (a shrug) Possible. 
88   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                                88 The patients file past the nurse's station, taking their meds from Hettie. They look unsettled. 
ED (aside to Ralph) Did you see the swimming pool this morning? The cops are all over it... Fingerprints, photographs... 
RALPH Next they'll send in the fucking coast guard. Lot of good it'll do Lana. 
HE SMASHES his fist on the counter, denting it.    Hettie looks at him. 
HETTIE Ralph, we're gonna start billing you for these outbursts. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Ralph just crumples his medication cup and throws it towards her. She glares at him, doesn't say anything. 
88A   NEARBY                                                           88A Cynthia and the other women from the group sit in a waiting area. Connie sits in a sunbeam, looking ethereal. Gilda is nearby, unmoving... tear stains on her cheeks. 
CONNIE Drowning isn't so bad... I remember when I died in Atlantis... It was like failing asleep. You know what's bad? Burning. When I was in the great Fire of London, well, let me tell you-- 
Hearing this, Cynthia chokes back a sob, jumps up and leaves the room. Miriam whirls on Connie. 
MIRIAM Connie, I don't know about your previous lives, but in this one, you're a shithead. 
CYNTHIA Yes. (to Miriam) See you later. And...     thanks. 
MIRIAM Thank you. 
Miriam then gets into the elevator.         The doors remain open, Alan turns to Cynthia. 
ALAN How are you feeling? 
CYNTHIA Fine. 
ALAN Good. 
He heads off in the opposite direction. Cynthia watches him. She turns back towards Miriam. Miriam is alone in the elevator except for one other person. 
Miriam smiles and waves. 
Cynthia smiles and waves. 
From behind Miriam, Harris, all burned and puffy, smiles and waves. 
The elevator doors close. 
CYNTHIA No! 
Alan whirls around.       Cynthia rushes to the elevator. 
CYNTHIA (CONT'D) Miriam!    Stop! 
She bangs on the buttons. She pounds on the doors.          Everyone in the corridor turns to look. 
ALAN Cynthia? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
He starts to approach.   She runs to a stairwell.

VOICE Cynthia! 
ANOTHER VOICE She's trying to get away! 
There are PEOPLE pounding through the brush all around her. She gets up and runs along the path into the forest. 
VOICE Cynthia! We want you to stay with us! You mustn't be afraid! 
She is in total panic, running blindly. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
CYNTHIA Please, no. 
Branches thrash her face. She can barely see where she is going, but she comes to a halt when she reaches a dark precipice, a cliff which seemingly has no bottom--just black as night. 
The people are getting nearer. 
FEMALE VOICE She's over here. 
We see someone nearing through the brush. 
HARRIS No pain, Cynthia. There's no pain. Come with us. Share with us. Take my hand. 
Cynthia looks down the cliff. 
ORDERLY'S VOICE Take my hand.

Down the hall further, another vent. 
ED'S VOICE Come with us, Cynthia! 
CONNIE'S VOICE You must join us, Cynthia! 
Cynthia follows the voices. She is underneath another larger vent with a fan spinning inside. Everyone in the hall ignores her. 
HARRIS' VOICE Cynthia, you must reach out and embrace our love for you... You must reach out to me... 
We see Harris now, behind the fan, in brief flashes of light, burnt then normal, gazing down at Cynthia. He reaches towards her. 
CYNTHIA Where are Connie and Ed? 
His fingers ARE SLICED OFF BY THE FAN.       He takes no notice. 
HARRIS They're with us now. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
We hear SPLASHING. Cynthia looks over. Gallons of blood and solid matter pour out of the ceiling vents all down the hall. 
CYNTHIA Where are they? (she is frantic) Where are Connie and Ed?   Where are they? 
Alan wonders at the pouring red, then he hears Cynthia screaming. He runs down the hall to stop her. 
The patients and nurses watch the blood pour in horror. Cynthia is getting more and more hysterical. 
CYNTHIA (CONT'D) Where are Connie and Ed? 
Alan corners her. 
ALAN It's all right--it's all right-- 
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a BL00D-COVERED BODY careens into them, driving them apart!

RALPH What the fuck is going on?

RALPH (to his cop) Just a sec. 
CYNTHIA Ralph? What is it? 
RALPH Nothing. I just came to tell you-- (smiling, conspiratorially) Everything's gonna be okay. 
CYNTHIA What's going to be okay? 
He goes into the bathroom and rinses his blood-soaked hand. Cynthia sees this.

CYNTHIA Ralph was just here.   His hand was... all bloody. 
They go to the door and they are immediately faced with Hettie. 
HETTIE Dr. Goldman, have you seen Ralph? 
ALAN I was going to ask you the same thing. 
She holds up a paper cup with a tablet in it. 
HETTIE He didn't take his four o'clock. If he misses this one, I'm gonna...

Ralph stops suddenly and turns to him. Ralph smiles warmly. Suddenly he hits the cop in the head using two fists. 
The cop falls.

These hallways are unused.       Nobody around. 
ALAN Was he behaving strangely? 
CYNTHIA No more strangely than everybody also in this place. 
CYNTHIA'S POLICEMAN (with walkie-talkie) I can't get him. He must be shut off.

They pass an open freight elevator.       Cynthia looks in it and stops. 
There is a droplet of blood on the floor inside. 
Cynthia is terrified. 
RALPH (CONT'D) I think you know the word I'm searching for. 
He starts making deep slashes on his arm. 
RALPH (CONT'D) U, N, I, T, Y! Unity! 
CYNTHIA Oh God, Ralph! No! 
RALPH Yes, oh, yes! Eternal bliss! 
He stops and raises the scalpels to his chest.   He jabs them in and cuts open down to his stomach. 
CYNTHIA Ralph, please, stop! 
He swats at the one remaining lamp. It flickers on and off. Ralph's eyes flutter. He FALLS. Cynthia rushes to him. 
CYNTHIA (CONT'D) Ralph! 
He throws a scalpel at her.   It misses, but she is spattered with blood. 
RALPH (fading) Get back. 
Cynthia is crouched down, crying as she watches him.

Wasserman comes over to Alan and Berrisford. 
WASSERMAN You're running out of patients, Doctors.

WASSERMAN She's having a little trouble with reality--as usual.

ALAN (stunned) Isolation? Are you out of your mind? That girl needs human contact--connection--isolation is the worst thing you can do-- 
BERRISFORD Dr. Goldman, I know you're fond of the girl, but you're out of line. 
ALAN Shit. You want her on the edge, don't you... You want to play your theory out to the end-- 
Suddenly HARRIS sits up in the rear seat, a smile on the burned and scarred face. 
HARRIS Good work, Dr. Goldman.   Now, it's your turn. 
Skeletal hands GRAB Alan's throat.       He STRUGGLES.   KICKS--out of the corner of his eye he sees- 
171R   FRONT OF CAR                                                          171R Gasoline is flowing over the dented hood and through the cracked windshield and over the dash and over Alan. More and more comes. 
171S   BACK TO SCENE                                                         171S Holding Alan with one hand, Harris leans forward, pulls out the cigarette lighter! He holds the GLOWING TIP up in the air. 
HARRIS (CONT'D) Need a light? 
He presses the burning tip against Alan's gasoline soaked CREEK. It SIZZLES--Alan SCREAMS-- 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
171T   CAR - LONG SHOT                                                  171T It EXPLODES-- 
CUT TO: 
171U   ALAN - IN HIS CAR                                                171U He jerks his head up, face drenched in sweat. He's still in his original parking space! He's never even started the car! Gasping for air, still freaked, he opens the door, tumbles out. 
171V   PARKING LOT                                                      171V The box of his possessions is still on the roof of the car. Alan sees this, staggers against the car, fights a wave of nausea. Struggling to remain composed, he takes his pulse. Feels his head. Suspicion crosses his face. Then his hand moves to his shirt pocket. 
171W   FLASH CUT                                                        171W of himself taking the pill by the clinic sign. 
171X   BACK TO THE PRESENT                                              171X fingers down his throat. He HEAVES his guts out beside his car... but when he straightens up, he's clear eyed and lucid. He turns, runs like hell towards the clinic. 
171Y   INT.   CLINIC PHARMACY - NIGHT                                   171Y RON, the pharmacist, looks up as Alan storms inside. 
RON Goldman, you look like shit-- 
ALAN (pushing him aside) Show me the scrips for the therapy group-- 
RON Come on, man, I can't do that-- it's Berrisford's show all the way-- 
Ignoring him, Alan finds the files. 
ALAN Shit, this is all standard stuff-- 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
RON What do you expect? 
ALAN Do you fill these prescriptions? 
RON Nah, Berrisford does it. He comes in every morning and sets up the medication for the day--Hettie takes it as she needs it-- 
ALAN Fuck! 
He turns, tries to open the glass case with the prearranged trays. It's locked. He grabs a paperweight, SMASHES THE GLASS. 
RON Hey--! 
Alan pulls out the tray, scans it. He grabs Ron by the collar, shoves the files into his face. 
ALAN Read it.   Pesco, Ralph-- 
RON He's dead-- 
ALAN READ IT!   What's he down for? 
RON Ah, Lithium--four times a day-- 
Alan grabs the tray, holds up a pill. 
ALAN Is that Lithium? 
RON Fuck, no--that's Endoral--the complete opposite--one of those, even a normal person would flip out-- 
ALAN Tell me about it-- 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
Alan looks at the tray and its compartments labeled for Lana, Miriam, Ed... all the others. Alan GRABS them all. 
ALAN (CONT'D) What's this? And this?      And this? 
RON This is, uh, dextroamphetamine... Christ, take one of these and you can walk on the ceiling. Holy mother. Methylphenidate! Don't mass with that fucker. Clonodine! Chlorapromazine! Preludin? Shit, I didn't know they still made that... Two of these and Mother Teresa would turn into a maniac! 
BERRISFORD Dr. Goldman. 
Alan turns around. 
Berrisford bashes him in the head, neatly slicing off some skin. Alan flies against the wall. 
The gun is knocked away. 
Alan writhes a little, then dips into unconsciousness, 
Cynthia is a basket case.     She looks at Alan. 
CYNTHIA No...   no... no... 
Berrisford comes to her and starts giving her an injection. 
She calms herself.     She looks at him dreamily. 
191A   CYNTHIA'S POV                                                       191A She sees Harris gazing at her lovingly. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
HARRIS Only one thing matters. 
She touches his face. 
CYNTHIA Our love.     We'll be together.   All of us. 
Berrisford taken Alan's gun. 
192   INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER                        192 Alan comes to. The ALARMS and BELLS are still ringing. Cynthia and Berrisford are gone. 
ALAN Shit! 
193   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                             193 The corridors are run amuck with isolation patients (the worst kind) all escaped from their rooms. Alan runs out of Cynthia's room. He is surrounded by bizarre-looking people screaming, singing, dancing, praying. 
Hettie is by the stairway helping Isolation patients exit. 
HETTIE One at a time! No pushing!      Please do not use the elevator! 
Alan is frantically looking for Cynthia and Berrisford, checking everywhere, pushing open doors. 
The security guards are at the far end of the hallway.    Alan goes to Hettie. 
ALAN Where's Berrisford? 
HETTIE This is your fault! These goddamn doors won't re-lock! 
ALAN (furious ) Where is he? He's going to kill Cynthia! Tell me where he is! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
HETTIE I haven't seen him! 
The guards see Alan.      They come after him.   He runs. 
Alan scans every room. He slams into patients. The guards aren't far behind. Alan turns a corner, passing a door marked "NOT AN EXIT: ROOF ACCESS." It is ajar. He goes in without the guards seeing him. 
194   INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT                                                 194 It is dark, but the red lights FLASH. He runs up several flights. The landings face onto the outside with a railing, open, no glass. 
He turns a corner.      Cynthia is there. 
She in perched on the outside of the railing, a serene expression on her face, the wind blowing her frail white gown. 
Alan freezes.      He moves towards her slowly, hands outstretched. 
ALAN (soothingly) Cynthia, take my hand... Just relax... Think about what you're doing... Stay calm... I want you to take my hand... 
She watches him blankly.      She turns to someone behind Alan. 
CYNTHIA It's so beautiful. 
Alan turns. There on the stair above is Berrisford, his face dancing in the flashing red light. 
ALAN (to Berrisford) You piece of shit! 
Cynthia lets go. 
Alan reaches out. 
ALAN No! 
CYNTHIA S...stop it... Stop it! 
Berrisford SHOOTS. One of Alan's finger joints is BLOWN AWAY. He SCREAMS, his grip loosens, and he SLIDES down the railing. Berrisford moves several yards to stay close... begins to POUND on Alan's mutilated hand. 
ALAN Cynthia, don't let him kill you! Don't let him do this! 
CYNTHIA Unity... It... it's my destiny... I've fought it too long. Right or wrong... my death has a purpose... It will close the book. End the story. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
ALAN Your life has a purpose... to bring joy and happiness! You're part of my life now. That's an unfinished story, too... 
She looks at Berrisford viciously pounding on Alan's hand. 
CYNTHIA Let me up.     Stop it. 
She starts to climb up, but she can't. 
CYNTHIA (CONT'D) Let me up! 
BERRISFORD I'm afraid it's too late for that. 
Alan's grip on her slips down to two fingers. They CRACK. She yells from the pain. She swings in the breeze. 
Alan is weakening.   He is losing consciousness.   He knows he is about to die. 
GUARD Dr. Berrisford? 
Suddenly Berrisford freezes. 
He is paralyzed at the sight of one of the guards coming up the stairs. Berrisford backs away glaring. 
Alan GROANS.   The guard rushes over. 
GUARD (CONT'D) Jesus (Yelling down the stairs) Gomez, get up here! 
The other guard appears. 
They start helping Alan up by Pulling his arm. As they help him up, Berrisford, in a state of shock, backs further up the wall. He leans against the wall and puts the gun to his head. He trembles. He pulls the trigger. 
CLICK. 
CLICK, CLICK, CLICK. Out of bullets. The others are too busy to be noticing what he in doing. Just as they pull Cynthia to the edge, she looks up to see: 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) 
Berrisford coming to the railing, and jumping, calmly. Silently. 
GUARD (CONT'D) Holy shit. 
Cynthia numbly watches him fall.    Then she in pulled up and over... 
CUT TO: 
200   INT. HALLWAY - OVERHEAD - NIGHT                                 200 Cynthia is plopped over onto a gurney. Lights are passing her. She is being whisked down a hallway. She is descending into a haze of unconsciousness. 
DOCTOR'S VOICE I need a detox prep! Stat! 
CYNTHIA It was him... 
201   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                            201 Alan runs alongside the gurney with doctors and nurses. He clutches bloody bandages to his hand, tries to hear Cynthia. 
ALAN It's okay. It's over. It was Berrisford. He killed them. 
CYNTHIA Then all those other things... Faces... voices? They were...      in my head? 
ALAN It was Berrisford. He shot you up with hallucinogens. What he didn't do, you imagined. 
There is joy through her delirium. She is just able to clasp hands with him briefly before she disappears behind a set of double doors. 
202   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY                                         202 A new station wagon whisks along the pretty road. 
203   INT. STATION WAGON - DAY                                             203 Alan drives, Cynthia looks at a map.       They both look relaxed. They both have bandaged hands. 
CYNTHIA Go right if that's the interstate. Yeah, it is. 
207   EXT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY                                               207 Through the greenery are the charred and overgrown remains of Unity House. A chiseled sign embedded into a tree verifies it. Alan and Cynthia pull up, park. Cynthia gets out and looks around. She goes to the front entrance. Alan follows her in. 
Cynthia gives a final look around at the deteriorated structure and turns down the stairs. 
She stands at the top of what remains of the stairs. 
We FOLLOW HER DOWN. Just as she nears the bottom, the TICKING of a clock is audible. It gets LOUDER. Cynthia reaches the last stop and turns into 
215   INT. FOYER - NIGHT                                                215 We FOLLOW HER with a CONTINUOUS PAN. The foyer is new now, completely untouched by fire, just as it was at the beginning of the film. A candelabrum is lit. 
Cynthia turns and we PAN BACK TO THE STAIRCASE. It is new, unburnt. Two KIDS come scrambling down the stairs laughing. 
The entranceway, the archway to the front room, the staircase are all intact, just as we saw them in the opening scene. 
CYNTHIA peers into the kitchen. Two WOMEN in work aprons are kneading bread dough, chopping vegetables. They smile at Cynthia. 
WOMAN 1 Cynthia!   Are you staying for supper? 
Cynthia is silent, wide-eyed, taking it all in.    She turns towards the front door. Victor is coming in. 
VICTOR Cynthia.   It's good.   Come in. 
She in unable to resist. 
216   INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT                                           216 They walk in. The room is filled with people. There is a fire in the hearth. Children play. Candles illuminate the space. Unity Members smile and great her casually as she passes them. 
Miriam in talking with a BEARDED MAN intently. 
MIRIAM Cynthia, I'm so glad you're here. 
Ed and Connie are by the fireplace with some others.    They smile at Cynthia knowingly. 
Lana is sitting contentedly on the window seat reading with some children. 
Ralph is crouched with victor in a corner.    They are laughing warmly. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Gilda comes up to her. She is ebullient, happier, healthier looking than we've ever seen her. 
GILDA Cynthia, it's so wonderful here, but we miss you terribly. 
Cynthia nears Harris. He smiles at her and kisses her. Everyone in the room turns to her. Harris holds up a shiny and sharp knife with ornamentation on the handle. Cynthia doesn't see it yet. 
He puts the pointed tip against her chest. 
HARRIS It's time, Cynthia.    It's finally time, isn't it? 
EVERYONE Yes. 
CYNTHIA (fighting the vision) You don't exist. 
HARRIS I wouldn't say that. (he touches her) Go on. Take the knife. 
She can't escape his gaze. 
HARRIS (CONT'D) Do it.   You know you want to. 
GILDA You know you do, Cynthia. 
VICTOR You'll see how beautiful it is. 
SOMEONE ELSE You will. 
Cynthia clasps her hand around the knife at her chest, Harris lets go. She holds it there by herself, completely hypnotized by his words, by his eyes. 
MIRIAM Cynthia, we're only telling you this because we love you. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
HARRIS Beautiful lovechild. All will be in balance when you've joined us. All will be right when daughter is with father. 
SOMEONE You're special, Cynthia. 
SOMEONE ELSE Scared blood... daughter of the father. 
Cynthia in mortified. 
CYNTHIA I'm...? 
HARRIS Now you remember.

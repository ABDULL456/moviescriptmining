1 INT. NETHERFIELD - HERTFORDSHIRE - DAY. I 
A vast mansion is coming to life. Maids pull dustsheets off furniture; servants open shutters. Sunshine spills into the great rooms of Netherfield. outside, a glimpse of rolling parkland. 
TITLE: "It is a truth universally acknowledged... 
Its a whirlwind of activity. Servants bustle around, sweeping and polishing, readying the house for its new occupants. The shutters of a room are opened onto the imposing gardens. A coach pulls up and, through the window, we see a young man get out. 
"that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife" 
A white sheet is pulled from a spinet and obscures our vision. 
CUT TO: 
2 EXT. LONGBOURN HOUSE - DAY. 2 
Elizabeth Bennet, 20, good humoured, attractive, clearly nobody's fool, walks through a field of tall meadow grass. She is reading a novel entitled 'First Impressions'. She approaches Longbourn, a fairly run down 17th Century house with a small moat around it. Elizabeth jumps up onto a wall and crosses the moat by walking a wooden plank duck board, a reckless trick learnt in early childhood. She walks passed the back of the house where, through an open window to the library, we see her mother and father, Mr and Mrs Bennet. 
MRS BENNET My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last? We follow Elizabeth into the house, but still overhear her parents' conversation. 
MRS BENNET (CONT'D) Do you not want to know who has taken it? 
MR BENNET As you wish to tell me, I doubt I have any choice in the matter... 
3 INT. LONGBOURN - CONTINUOUS. 
As Elizabeth walks through the hallway, we hear the sound of piano scales plodding through the afternoon. She walks down the entrance hall past the room where Mary, 18, the bluestocking of the family, is practising, and finds Kitty, 16, the second youngest, and Lydia, 15, the precocious baby of the family, are listening at the door to the library. 
LYDIA 
(TO ELIZABETH) Have you heard? A Mr Bingley, a young man from the North of England, has come down on Monday in a chaise and four. 
KITTY With five thousand a year! Jane, (the eldest, most beautiful and most charmingly naive of the girls), joins them at the door. 
JANE Goodness! 
LYDIA - and he's single to be sure! 
INT. LIBRARY - LONGBOURN - CONTINUOUS. 
Mr Bennet is trying to ignore Mrs Bennet. 
MRS BENNET What a fine thing for our girls! 
MR BENNET Bow can it affect them? 
MRS BENNET My dear Mr Bennet, how can you be so tiresome! You know that he must marry one of them. 
MR BENNET Oh, so that is his design in settling here? Mr Bennet takes a book from his table and walks out of the library into the corridor where the girls are gathered, Mrs Bennet following. 
4 INT. CORRIDOR - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 
Mr Bennet walks through the girls to the drawing room pursued by Mrs Bennet. 
MRS BENNET - So you must go and visit him at once. 
5 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 5 
Mr Bennet walks to the bookshelf to replace the book he is carrying. Mary is there practising the piano. The girls come in to listen. 
LYDIA Oh, yes, Papa. 
KITTY Please, Papa! 
MR BENNET There is no need, for I already have. The piano stops. A frozen silence. They all stare. 
MRS BENNET You have? 
JANE when? 
MRS BENNET â¢ How can you tease me, Mr Bennet. You have no compassion for my poor nerves? 
CHARLOTTE On the contrary, he has ten thousand a year and owns half of Derbyshire. 
CUT TO: Sir William Lucas, 53 a hale but unsophisticated member of the self-made gentry, takes it upon himself to introduce Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy to his daughter Charlotte and the Bennet family. 
SIR WILLIAM (to Mr Bingley) My eldest daughter you know, Mrs Bennet ...miss Jane Bennet, Elizabeth and Miss Mary Bennet. 
MRS BENNET It is a pleasure. I have two others but 
they are already dancing. 
MR BINGLEY Delighted to make your acquaintance. 
SIR WILLIAM And may I introduce Mr Darcy. 
(SIGNIFICANT LOOK) -- of Pemberley, in Derbyshire! A stiff bow from Darcy, Elizabeth smiles, Darcy does not. 
CUT TO: Moments later. Elizabeth is standing in a small group with Jane, Bingley, Miss Bingley and Darcy. Bingley can't keep his eyes off Jane, but is frightfully at a loss in disguising his instant ardour. 
ELIZABETH How do you like it here in Hertfordshire, Mr Bingley? 
MR BINGLEY (smiling at Jane shyly) Very much. 
ELIZABETH The library at Netherfield, I've heard, is one of the finest in the country. 
MR BINGLEY Yes, it fills me with guilt. He looks at Jane a little blush starts around his collar. 
BINGLEY Not a good reader, you see. I like being out of doors. I mean, I can read, of 
COURSE - His sister steps in. as the blush threatens to engulf his ears. 
MISS BINGLEY 
(TO DARCY) Your library at Pemberly, Mr Darcy, is astonishingly good. 
DARCY Thank you. It is the work of many generations. 
MISS BINGLEY And then you have added so much to it yourself. 
JANE I wish I read more, but there always seems so many other things to do. 
BINGLEY That's exactly what I meant. He beams at Jane. 
CUT TO: Mr and Mrs Bennet stand a little apart from Elizabeth and the other young people. Lydia and Kitty bound up to them in a state of high excitement. 
LYDIA Mama! The regiment is arriving next week! 
KITTY And will be here for the whole winter! Mrs Forster told us! 
LYDIA They're going to be stationed in the village! 
CUT TO: Mr Bingley'turns to Jane. 
MR BINGLEY May I have the honour? They leave, to dance. 
ELIZABETH Do you dance Mr Darcy? 
DARCY Not if I can help it. Elizabeth, Darcy and Miss Bingley stand in silence as they over hear the following... 
CUT TO: 
LYDIA officers! Lots of officers! 
KITTY How will we meet them? 
LYDIA It's easy. You just walk up and down in front of them and drop something. Lydia pantomimes the actions for Kitty. 
LYDIA â¢ They pick it up. You say 'oh thank you sir' and blush prettily and then you're introduced! 
MR BENNET I have long suspected that we have two of the silliest girls in the county. 
MRS BENNET Oh Mr Bennet! I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself, and if a smart young colonel with six thousand a year should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him. Mr Darcy overhears this. Profoundly embarrassed, Lizzie moves away. 
CUT TO: The dance floor. Mr Bingley is dancing with Jane. His ears blushing with thrilled embarrassment. Mrs Bennet, with a group of other mothers, watches the young couple with rather too obvious satisfaction. 
MRS BENNET 7 That dress becomes her, does it not. 7 â¢ Though of course my Jane needs little help from couturiers. Elizabeth wanders through the throng. She looks at Bingley and Jane ending the dance - she is coy and demure, he clearly smitten - 
CUT TO: Darcy is joined by Bingley exhilarated by the dance. 
ELIZABETH Jane! Jane's face lights up. Elizabeth kisses her. 
JANE Lizzie! Oh, your face is so cold. They're being so kind to me, I feel such a terrible imposition. 
ELIZABETH Don't worry. I don't know who is more pleased at your being here, Mama or Mr Bingley. Bingley comes in having attended to the doctor. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Thank you for tending to my sister so diligently, it seems she is in better comfort here than she would be at home. 
BINGLEY It is a pleasure, I mean not to see her so sick, of course, that's terrible. I will have a room made up for you. You must be our guest here until Jane recovers. 
21 INT. DRAWING ROOM - NETHERFIELD -- DAY. 21 
Darcy is quietly reading as Bingley paces about anxiously. Caroline berates him from the sofa. 
CAROLINE BINGLEY Stay!? She is a perfectly sweet girl but save being an excellent walker, there is very little to recommend her. 
BINGLEY I thought she showed remarkable spirit coming all this way. 
CAROLINE BINGLEY The eldest Miss Bennet, as you know, I hold in excessive regard and I wish her well settled. Though I do fear with her families low connections there is little chance of it. Their uncle is in trade, you know, in Cheapside. 
BINGLEY If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside it would not make them one jot less agreeable. 
22 EXT. GARDEN -- LONGBOURN - DAY. 22 
Mr Bennet is overseeing the gardener who is pruning the hedge. Mrs Bennet bustles up. She looks very pleased with herself. 
MRS BENNET Well, my dear, its all going according to plan. He's half in love with her already! 
MR BENNET (a touch disingenuously) Who, my sweetest? 
MRS BENNET Mr Bingley! And he doesn't mind that she hasn't a penny, for he has enough for the two of them. Suddenly a distant trumpet sounds, dogs bark. The militia are arriving. Lydia and Kitty rush past. They are dressed up to the nines to greet the officers. Mrs Bennet's face lights up. 
â¢ MRS BENNET Wait for me! 
And she's gone. Mr Bennet gazes at their departing â¢ figures. 
23 EXT. MERYTON VILLAGE - DAY. 23 
Mrs Bennet and her two daughters rush down the street into the village. Dogs bark, children run alongside as a regiment of soldiers march through the street. Geese scatter; shopkeepers stand in their doorways. The two Bennet girls simper at the handsome young soldiers. Mrs Bennet, flushed and excited, runs panting behind them. Lydia deliberately drops her hankerchief. One of the soldiers stands on it. She is appalled. 
24 INT. DRAWING ROOM - NETHERFIELD - EVENING. 24 
Elizabeth is reading a book. Darcy is writing a letter. Bingley is sat nervously. Caroline, obviously bored, wanders the room looking for distraction. She looks over Darcy's shoulder. 
CAROLINE BINGLEY You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy. 
MR DARCY (without looking up) â¢ You are mistaken. I write rather slowly. Caroline Bingley lingers, annoyingly. 
CAROLINE BINGLEY How many letters you must have occasion to write, Mr Darcy. Letters of business too. How odious I should think them! 
DARCY It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours. 
CAROLINE BINGLEY Please tell your sister that I long to see her. 
DARCY I have already told her once, by your desire. Lizzie looks across from her book. 
CAROLINE BINGLEY I do dote on her, I was quite in raptures at her beautiful little design for a table. 
DARCY 
Perhaps you will give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again. At present I have not enough room to do them justice. Mr Bingley now pacing anxiously around the room. 
MR BINGLEY Its amazing, how young ladies have the patience to be so accomplished. 
CAROLINE BINGLEY What do you mean, Charles? 
MR BINGLEY They all paint tables, and embroider cushions and play the piano. I never heard of a young lady, but people say she is accomplished. 
DARCY The word is indeed applied too liberally. I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen women, in all my acquaintance, that are truely accomplished. 
â¢ CAROLINE BINGLEY Nor I, to be sure! 
ELIZABETH Goodness! You must comprehend a great deal in the idea. 
DARCY I do. 
CAROLINE BINGLEY Absolutely. She must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing and the modern languages, to deserve the word. And something in her air and manner of walking. 
DARCY I find it perfectly adequate even if society is a little less varied than in town. 
MRS BENNET But I assure you there is quite as much going on in the country as there is in the town. 
ELIZABETH Indeed Mania, I think Mr Darcy merely meant there were not such a variety of people to be met in the country as there are in town, which you must acknowledge to be true. 
â¢ MRS BENNET Nonsense, we dine with four and twenty families. Sir William Lucas for instance is a very agreeable man. So very genteel and easy. Elizabeth cringes. 
LYDIA Mr Bingley, is it true that you have promised to hold a ball here at Netherfield? 
BINGLEY Well... 
LYDIA It would be an excellent way to meet new friends. You could invite the militia. 
KITTY Oh do hold a ball. 
ELIZABETH (trying to stop Bingley being 
BAMBOOZLED) Kitty... 
BINGLEY When your sister has recovered you shall name the day. 
MARY I think a Ball is a perfectly irrational way to gain new acquaintance. It would be better if conversation instead of dancing were the order of the day. 
CAROLINE BINGLEY Indeed much more rational but rather less like a ball. 
ELIZABETH Thank you, Mary. 
BINGLEY (to Mrs Bennet) Please let me show you to Jane, you will find her quite recovered. 
CUT TO: 
30 EXT. DRIVE -- NETHERFIELD - DAY. 
The Bennet's carriage awaits. The Bingley's are gathered to see the Bennet's off. Jane is radiant - in the peak of health. 
JANE (to the Bingley's) Really, I don't know how to thank you. Bingley beams bashfully. He can't take his eyes off her. 
BINGLEY Really, you're welcome anytime you feel the least bit poorly. 
ELIZABETH 
(TO CAROLINE) Thank you for such stimulating company. It has been most instructive. 
CAROLINE BINGLEY Not at all. The pleasure is all mine. Elizabeth looks at Darcy, who does not say anything. She gets in the carriage. 
ELIZABETH Mr Darcy. 
DARCY Miss Bennet. They share a look as Elizabeth joins the rest of the Bennets in the carriage. The driver takes off. Bingley waves enthusiastically to Jane. 
BINGLEY Goodbye. Goodbye. 
31 INT. CARRIAGE - LEAVING NETHERFIELD - THE SAME. 31 
The family are all squeezed in rather too tightly. 
MRS BENNET What a high and mighty man that Mr Darcy is, quite eaten up with pride. 
32 EXT. MERYTON - DAY. 3 
The Bennet's carriage is stopped in its tracks by the Militia who are marching en masse through town. 
â¢ 33 INT. CARRIAGE - MERYTON - DAY. 33 
Lydia cannot believe her eyes as row after row of soldiers pass by the carriage with not a few of the men looking in at the Bennet girls with some interest. 
LYDIA I can't believe it, there must be a thousand of them. Leading the one troupe of Militia is Wickham a very handsome blonde officer, Lydia spots him and swoons. 
ELIZABETH (to the coachman) Please, drive on. 
34 INT. LONGBOURN - HERTFORDSHIRE - DAY. 34 
As the Bennet girls come into the house, Lydia eulogizing the Militia, they meet Mr Bennet. 
MR BENNET I hope, my dear, that you have ordered a good dinner today, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family 
party. Mr Bennet holds up the letter. 
Later; we can see the girls and Mr Bennet gathered by the fire through the doorway. Mr Collins leaves the room and takes Mrs Bennet aside to a very discrete conference, out of hearing of anyone else. 
COLLINS Mrs Bennet. You do know I have been bestowed by the good grace of Lady Catherine de Bough a parsonage of no mean size. 
â¢ MRS BENNET I have become aware of the fact. 
COLLINS â¢ Well, it.is my avowed hope that soon I may find a mistress for it, and I have to inform you that the eldest Miss Bennet has captured my special attention. Collins looks lasciviously into the room. 
MRS BENNET Mr Collins, unfortunately it is incumbent on me to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet is - very soon to be engaged. 
COLLINS Engaged! 
MRS BENNET But Miss Elizabeth next to her in both age and beauty would make anyone an excellent partner. Do not you agree, Mr Collins? Mr Collins looks through the doorway at Elizabeth 
COLLINS Indeed. Indeed. A very agreeable alternative. 
39 EXT. BACK MEADOW - LONGBOURN - DAY. 39 
Elizabeth and Jane are walking towards the house when, across the moat, they see Mr Collins come out of the house and advance towards them. 
ELIZABETH Oh no! Mx Collins spots them and darts through a door in the garden wall and hurries towards the bridge to meet them. 
ELIZABETH Quick! This way! She pulls Jane across the duck board spanning the moat, through the house and out the front. Mr Collins doubles back and follows them into the house. The girls are no-where to be seen. He looks around, puzzled. 
40 EXT. MERYTON VILLAGE - DAY. 40 
â¢ Elizabeth and Jane arrive in the village. Jane, forever the dutiful daughter, looks uneasy- Elizabeth is flushed and reckless. She looks behind them- 
ELIZABETH 
(LAUGHS) 
We've lost him. They slow down to a walk. And then stop. outside the milliner's shop the incorrigible Lydia and Kitty are chatting to Wickham, the dashing young officer we spotted earlier. He is utterly gorgeous - slim, handsome, tousled hair. The perfect romantic hero. 
ELIZABETH Kitty? Lydia! She and Jane join them. 
LYDIA We just happened to be looking for some ribbon, didn't we, Kitty? 
(KITTY NODS) And we met Mr Wickham. 
KITTY He picked up Lydia's gloves! 
LYDIA He's a lieutenant! Wickham bows. 
WICKHAM I'm enchanted. Shall we all look at some ribbons together? 
LYDIA Oh yes! 
41 INT. MILLINER'S SHOP - DAY. 41 
They come into the shop. The others go towards the counter. Wickham hangs back, and smiles a complicit, witty smile at Elizabeth. She colours. 
WICKHAM Though I must warn you, I have very poor taste. 
ELIZABETH 
(SMILES) Only a man truly confident of himself would admit that. 
WICKHAM No, it's true. My rooms in town, decorated, I thought, in the height of â¢ fashion, have reduced grown men to tears of mirth. 
ELIZABETH' 
Â¢ (LAUGHS) Then why don't you change them? 
MR WICKHAM And deny people such pleasure? 
ELIZABETH So you don't mind being laughed at? 
MR WICKHAM Not particularly. 
ELIZABETH It is a somewhat sterile quality, is it not, to be aware of ones importance in the world. 
WICKHAM Especially if, like me, one has none. Elizabeth looks at him with interest. A beat. The moment is broken by Lydia coming up. 
LYDIA Lizzie, please lend me some money! 
ELIZABETH 
Â¢ ELIZABETH Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest misfortune of all - to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! 
CUT TO: Elizabeth dances face to face with Darcy. Neither can speak. They dance for a moment in silence. 
ELIZABETH I do love a Sarabande. 
DARCY Indeed. Most invigorating. They continue, for a moment, in silence. 
ELIZABETH It is your turn to say something, Mr Darcy - I talked about the dance, now you ought to remark on the size of the room or the number of couples. 
DARCY I am perfectly happy to oblige, please advise me of what you would like most to â¢ hear. 
ELIZABETH That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But for now we may be silent. 
DARCY Do you talk as a rule while dancing? 
ELIZABETH We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will - amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb. So a little lubrication to avoid embarrassment might be advantageous. 
DARCY I see no striking resemblance of your own character in this, how near it is to mine I cannot say. (beat) Tell me do you and your sisters very often walk to Meryton? 
They are suddenly parted by the choreography of the dance. 
We stay with Elizabeth who is whisked round the floor by an elderly man who smiles at her toothlessly, Elizabeth â¢ looks back at Darcy who is dancing with Lydia. He stare at Elizabeth as he dances. Elizabeth smiles at her current partner in embarrassment. 
ELIZABETH Very mild weather we've been having. 
DANCING PARTNER (deaf as a post) Sorry. The dance spins again and she is back with Darcy. 
ELIZABETH Yes, we often walk to Meryton - it is a great opportunity to meet new people. In fact when you met us we had just had the pleasure of forming a new acquaintance. 
DARCY I will admit your Mr Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends - whether he is capable of retaining them is less certain. 
ELIZABETH He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship. I remember hearing you once say that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created? 
DARCY I am. May I ask to what these questions tend. 
ELIZABETH To make out your character, Mr Darcy. 
DARCY And what have you discovered? 
ELIZABETH very little. The dancefinishes. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly. 
DARCY I hope to afford you more clarity in the â¢ future. 
â¢ They bow to each other and Elizabeth moves quickly away from Darcy. 
CUT TO: Elizabeth is at the buffet watching Kitty quaff a huge glass of wine and having the glass immediately refilled. She is joined by Caroline Bingley who also looks at Kitty disapprovingly. 
CAROLINE BINGLEY Miss Elizabeth. Let me recommend you as a friend not to give too much confidence to all of the assertions your friend Mr Wickham might make. He is indeed a charming man, but one should never forget from where he is descended. 
ELIZABETH His lack of trustworthiness and descent appear by your account to be the same thing, 
CAROLINE BINGLEY Please excuse my interterence, it was kindly meant. â¢ A breathless Mr Collins appears. 
COLLINS Is that Mr Darcy, of Pemberley in Derbyshire? 
ELIZABETH I believe so. 
COLLINS But I must make myself known to him immediately! 
ELIZABETH But sir - 
COLLINS He is the nephew of my esteemed patroness, Lady Catherine. 
ELIZABETH 
(SURPRISED) He is? Mr Collins starts making his way determinedly towards Darcy. 
Â¢ ELIZABETH Please, Mr Collins! He'll consider it an 
IMPERTINENCE -- 
Elizabeth watches from a distance, with acute embarrassment, as Collins interrupts Darcy. Darcy does not notice him so Collins raises his voice. 
COLLINS (CONT'D) Mr Darcy! The room around him stops. Darcy is surprised and turns round. In dumbshow we see Darcy is horrified by Collins' obsequiousness, during the conversation Collins points Elizabeth out to Darcy. 
MR COLLINS My object in coming to Longbourn was to choose such a one from amongst Mr Bennet's daughters, for as you know I am next in the entail of the estate and such an alliance will surely make amends for this. (drops to his knee) And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affections. 
ELIZABETH Mr Collins - 
MR COLLINS And that no reproach on the subject of fortune will cross my lips once we are â¢ married. 
ELIZABETH You are too hasty, sir! You forget that I have made no answer. 
MR COLLINS 
(UNPERTURBED) I must add, that Lady Catherine will thoroughly approve, when I speak to her of your modesty, economy and other amiable qualities. 
ELIZABETH Sir, I am honoured by your proposal, but regret I must decline it. 
MR COLLINS (momentarily taken aback, but 
RECOVERING) I know ladies have their pretty little ways, and don't seek to seem too eager - 
ELIZABETH (in some desperation) Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious. You could not make me happy and I'm convinced I'm the last woman in the world who could make you happy. 
â¢ MR COLLINS 
(PAUSE) I 'flatter myself, cousin, that your refusal is merely a natural delicacy. Besides, you should take into account that despite your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made to you - 
ELIZABETH (rising, deeply affronted) Mr Collins - 
MR COLLINS So I must conclude that you simply seek to increase my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females. 
ELIZABETH Sir! I am not the sort of female to torment a respectable man. Please understand me - I cannot accept you! Elizabeth storms out of the room and out of the house. Mrs Bennet crashes in through another door, hot on the tail of Elizabeth. 
MRS BENNET Declined indeed! The headstrong, foolish 
CHILD- 
COLLINS Thank you, but... Head strong? 
MRS BENNET - we shall have this little hiccup dealt with immediately, Mr Collins. Mrs Bennet goes chases after Elizabeth. Mr Collins watches through a window as Elizabeth is chased by her mother. 
51 INT. LIBRARY - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 51 
Mrs Bennet marches into the library. Mr Bennet looks up in shock. 
MRS BENNET Oh Mr Bennet. We are all in a uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr Collins, for she vows she will not have him. 
Mr Bennet starter at Mrs Bennet blankley. 
MRS BENNET Mr Collins, Mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie. But Lizzy declares she will not have him, and now the danger is Mr Collins may not have Lizzy. 
MR BENNET And what am I to do? Mrs Bennet drags Mr Bennet to his feet. 
MRS BENNET Speak to Lizzy. They march to find Elizabeth. 
52 INT. HALLWAY - LONGBOURN -- THE SAME. 52 
Mr Bennet and Mrs Bennet confront Elizabeth, who has been waiting in the hallway. Perhaps the other girls form an audience from the stairs, Mr Collins looks on sheepishly from the breakfast room. 
MRS BENNET Tell her that you insist upon them marrying. 
Â¢ LIZZIE Papa, please - '. 
MRS BENNET You will have this house! 
LIZZIE I can't marry him! 
MRS BENNET You'll save your sisters from destitution! 
LIZZIE I can't! - 
MRS BENNET Go back now and say you've changed your mind! 
LIZZIE No! 
MRS BENNET Think of your family! 
LIZZIE You can't make me! 
MRS BENNET Mr Bennet, say something! 
MR KENNET Still, it's a comfort to know that whatever might befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will be sure to make the most of it. A small smile from Elizabeth. 
58 INT. BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY 58 
Elizabeth is making the bed and tidying Jane's belongings. There is a knock at the door and Charlotte enters. 
CHARLOTTE My dear Elizabeth, I've come here to tell you the news. 
ELIZABETH â¢ What news? 
CHARLOTTE 
(DEFIANTLY) Mr Collins and I are engaged to be married. A stunned pause. 
ELIZABETH Engaged? 
CHARLOTTE 
(TIMIDLY) You don't mind, do you? 
ELIZABETH No, no... (tries to recover) Of course not. 
CHARLOTTE He asked for my hand this morning .and I accepted him. Elizabeth looks quite faint. Charlotte sits on the bed. Elizabeth, after a pause, sits down beside her. 
CHARLOTTE I can see you're surprised - coming so soon after his wishing to marry you... 
ELIZABETH 
(WEAKLY) No... 
CHARLOTTE I'm not a romantic, you know. I ask only a comfortable home, and considering Mr Collin's character, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can hope for. 
ELIZABETH And that's all you expect? 
CHARLOTTE For women in our situation, what choice is there? 
ELIZABETH 
(PASSIONATELY) Don't speak like that, Charlotte! 
CHARLOTTE â¢ - to become an old maid, at best tolerated, at worst a burden, dependent on the kindness of others? Or to seek the protection of marriage. 
ELIZABETH And we only have two choices? 
CHARLOTTE Yes. An appalled silence. Elizabeth gazes at her closest friend. Charlotte has recovered herself. she now looks cool and composed - unnervingly so. 
ELIZABETH You can still change your mind, Charlotte. 
CHARLOTTE (shakes her head) I'm twenty-seven years old. We hear the sound of the militia drums... 
59 EXT. MERYTON - DAY. 59 
The militia are leaving Meryton. Hundreds of soldiers and officers in the red coats marching out of the village to the sound of pipes and drums. The villagers are out to bid them farewell. Lydia and Kitty run through the crowds very distraught. They find Elizabeth coming in the other direction. 
LYDIA It's too dreadful! They're leaving for Brighton. 
ELIZABETH All of them? 
KITTY They got the call this morning. 
LYDIA Not a word of warning! Lydia wails. Elizabeth searches the red coats for Wickham. She spots him, he glances across at her, she gives a pathetic wave and he's gone. Lydia and Kitty chase the last of the officers, leaving Elizabeth alone. She walks into the post office. 
C 60 INT. VILLAGE POST OFFICE - THE SAME. 6 
The Postmaster hands a letter to Elizabeth. Elizabeth opens it and reads it. 
POSTMASTER Bad news, Miss? 
ELIZABETH It could not be worse. I have been invited to possibly the very last place on earth I would like to go. 
61 EXT. MERYTON - DAY. 61 
Elizabeth comes out of the post office to reveal... Time has passed, the now deserted village is covered in a thick blanket of snow. A lonely Elizabeth walks away totally despondent. 
62 EXT. HUNSFORD PARSONAGE - KENT - DAY. 6< 
Charlotte's new home is a smallish but charming rectory in Kent. Charlotte greets Elizabeth, kissing her warmly. â¢ Mr Collins bows as he ushers her in. 
(EAGERLY) It's very kind of you to ask us to dine, Lady Catherine. Lady Catherine ignores her. 
MR COLLINS (whispers to Lizzie) The chimneypiece alone cost Â£400. But Lizzie doesn't hear. Darcy walks into the room. Lizzie freezes. When he sees Lizzie he, too, falters, and recovers himself. Another man (Fitzwilliam) is with him. 
ELIZABETH â¢ Mr Darcy! What are you doing here? 
MR COLLINS Mr Darcy! (another deep bow) I had no idea we would have the honour... A stiff bow from Darcy, who looks at Mr Collins as if he's something brought in by the dog. He turns to Lizzie, trying to collect himself. 
DARCY 
(BOWS) Miss Bennet...I'm staying here. 
LADY CATHERINE 
(SURPRISED) You know my nephew? 
ELIZABETH Yes, madam, I had the pleasure of meeting him in Hertfordshire. Darcy's friend Fitzwilliam, a much more easy-going chap, introduces himself. 
FITZWILLIAM â¢ Colonel Fitzwilliam. How do you do? He bows. Lizzie returns his smile gratefully. They move towards the dining room. Mr Collins leans towards Lizzie. 
MR COLLINS 
(WHISPERING) You know Mr Darcy is as good as engaged to Miss de Bourg? 
ELIZABETH Really? Miss Bingley will be disappointed to hear that. (looks at the girl, and whispers to charlotte) What a sickly, cross little thing! Oh yes, they should suit each other very well. Charlotte smiles back, a little fearfully. She's more intimidated by Rosings than Elizabeth is, and indeed has more at stake. 68 INT. DINING ROOM - ROSINGS - NIGHT. f 9 The dining room is laid for a very grand dinner -- footmen waiting, thousands of candles. 
Lady Catherine seats herself at the head of the table. The guests wait for their orders. 
LADY CATHERINE You sit there and you sit there. Mr Collins! You can't sit next to your wife! After some awkward shuffling around they all sit down. Lizzie, much to her discomfort, finds herself sitting next to Darcy. There is a pause. 
MR DARCY I trust your family is in good health, Miss Bennet? 
ELIZABETH They are, thank you. 
(PAUSE) My eldest sister is currently in London, perhaps you happened to see her there? 
MR DARCY 
(AWKWARD PAUSE) I haven't been fortunate enough, no. Lizzie looks at him. He colours slightly. Lady Catherine addresses Lizzie in a loud voice, from the head of the table. 
LADY CATHERINE Do you play the pianoforte, Miss Bennet? 
ELIZABETH A little, ma'am, and very poorly. 
LADY CATHERINE Oh. Do you draw? 
ELIZABETH No, not at all. 
LADY CATHERINE Your sisters, do they draw? 
ELIZABETH Not one. 
LADY CATHERINE That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of the masters. 
ELIZABETH My mother would have no objection but my father hates London. 
LADY CATHERINE â¢ Has your governess left you? 
ELIZABETH We never had a governess. Mr Collins squirms in embarrassment. Darcy watches Elizabeth, keenly. 
LADY CATHERINE No governess? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess, I never heard such a thing! Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education. 
ELIZABETH (can't help smiling at this) Not at all, Lady Catherine. 
LADY CATHERINE Mmmm. Are any of your younger sisters out? 
ELIZABETH Yes, ma'am. All. 
LADY CATHERINE All! What, five out at once? Very odd! â¢ And you only the second - the younger ones out before the elders are married! Your youngest sisters must be very young. 
ELIZABETH Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. But I think it would be very hard on younger sisters, not to have their share of amusement because the elder is still unmarried. And to be kept back on such a motive! It would hardly encourage sisterly affection. 
LADY CATHERINE Upon my word, you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age? 
ELIZABETH 
(SMILES) With three younger sisters grown up, your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own to 
DARCY There was, however, I have to admit... the matter of your family - 
ELIZABETH Our want of connection? Mr Bingley didn't vex himself about that! 
DARCY No, it was more than that. 
ELIZABETH How, sir? 
DARCY (pause, very uncomfortable) It pains me to say this, but it was the lack of propriety shown by your mother, your three younger sisters - even, on occasion, your father. Forgive me. Lizzie blushes. He has hit home. Darcy paces up and down. 
DARCY You and your sister -- I must exclude from this... Darcy stops and gazes at her. He is in turmoil. Elizabeth glares at him, in a blaze of fury and misery. 
ELIZABETH And what about Mr Wickham? 
DARCY Mr Wickham? 
ELIZABETH What excuse can you give for your behavior to him? 
DARCY You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns! 
ELIZABETH He told me of his misfortunes. 
DARCY Oh yes, his misfortunes have been very great indeed! 
ELIZABETH You have ruined his chances, and yet treat him with sarcasm? 
DARCY So this is your opinion of me! Thank you for explaining so fully. Perhaps these offences might have been overlooked, if your pride had not been hurt - 
ELIZABETH My pride? 
DARCY - by my honesty in admitting scruples about our relationship. 
(MORE) 
DARCY (CONT'D) Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your circumstances? 
ELIZABETH And those are the words of a gentleman? From the first moment I met you, your arrogance and conceit, your selfish distain of the feelings of others, made me realize that you were the last man in the world I could ever be prevailed upon to marry. Darcy recoils, as if slapped. A terrible silence. 
DARCY Forgive me, madam, for taking up so much of your time. He leaves, abruptly. Elizabeth watches him stride away, through the rain. What has she done? She bitterly bursts into tears. 
73 INT. HUNSFORD - DAY. 73 
Elizabeth comes in soaked to the skin. Charlotte runs to her. 
CHARLOTTE Elizabeth! 
ELIZABETH I was caught somewhat off-guard. 
74 INT. BEDROOM - HUNSFORD - THE SAME. 74 
Charlotte attends to Elizabeth.who has changed and is drying her hair, a shawl around her shoulders. 
CHARLOTTE Shall I call the doctor? 
ELIZABETH No! Charlotte, I shall be quite all right. Please, give Lady de Bourgh my apologies. You must not keep her waiting. Mr Collins clatters up the stairs. 
COLLINS (popping his head around the 
DOOR) Come on. We shall be late! 
Charlotte leaves, reluctantly, and goes downstairs. 
CUT TO Later; The sound of the front door closing. Elizabeth sits down, heavily, on the bed. She walks downstairs and enters the drawing room. 
75 INT. DRAWING ROOM - HUNSFORD - DAY. 75 
Elizabeth is in the drawing room, she looks at a book on the table. It is Fordyce's Sermons. She puts it down and walks to the mirror and stares at herself. After a moment suddenly Darcy's face appears. She freezes. They stare at each other without speaking. Finally... 
DARCY I came to leave you this. He places a letter on the table behind her. Elizabeth does not turn but watches him through the mirror. 
DARCY (CONT'D) I'm not going to renew the sentiments which were so disgusting to you, but to address the two offenses you have laid against me. I had not long been in Hertfordshire before I saw that Bingley 
preferred your eldest sister. I observed my friend's behaviour attentively and I could perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I have ever witnessed in him. Elizabeth cannot bring herself to look at Darcy. She stares at her own reflection as he speaks. 
DARCY (CONT'D) Yet when I observed your sister .1 detected no symptom of peculiar regard, and witnessed only the families coarse appetite for having their daughters married favorably. And so in London, perhaps erroneously, I persuaded him of the unfitness of the match citing your sisters coolness towards him. We zoom in on Elizabeth's reflection. 
DARCY (CONT'D) It was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you appear naturally insufficient, they were done to protect a friend. As to the other â¢ more serious matter.. 
KITTY - and more so, because I'm two years older! Elizabeth looks to Jane. 
JANE Lydia has been invited to Brighton with the Foresters. 
MRS BENNET â¢ A little sea-bathing would set me up very 
NICELY- 
LYDIA I shall dine with the officers every night! An anguished wail from Kitty. 
MRS BENNET I'm sure I cried for two days when Colonel Millar's regiment went away. thought I should have broke my heart. 
LIZZIE Mother! Are you all mad? She glares at them, deeply upset -- by them, by everything. 
81 INT. THE GARDINERS' HOUSE - DAY. 81 
Elizabeth has found a quiet corner with her father. 
ELIZABETH Please Papa, don't let her go! 
MR BENNET Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little inconvenience as under the present circumstances. 
ELIZABETH (with great emotion) If you, dear father, will not take the trouble to check her, she will be fixed forever as the silliest and most determined flirt who ever made her family ridiculous. And Kitty will follow, as she always does. 
MR KENNET We shall have no peace until she goes. 
ELIZABETH (really angry now) Peace! Is that all you care about? 
MR BENNET Colonel Forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief, and she is far too poor to be an object of prey to anyone. 
ELIZABETH Father, its dangerous! - 
MR BENNET I'm sure the officers will find women better worth their while. Let us hope, in fact, that her stay in Brighton will teach her her own insignificance. At any rate she can hardly grow any worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life. Elizabeth gazes at her father - will nothing touch him? He gave up on his daughter long ago. For this, just now, she hates him. 
ELIZABETH No wonder our family is treated with contempt. She leaves, tears stinging her eyes. Her father looks puzzled at her outburst. 
82 INT. DRAWING ROOM - CHEAPSIDE - THE SAME. 82 
Mr Bennet follows Elizabeth in. 
MR BENNET Well, at least the house will be quieter. 
ELIZABETH I don't wish to be stuck with such a foolish family any longer, with your constant talk of men and marriages. Surely there is more to life. 
MRS GARDINER Lizzie dear, you would be very welcome to accompany us? 
MR GARDINER Oh yes. We plan to journey through the Peak District. You'd be most welcome. 
MARY Oh, the glories of nature! What are men, compared to rocks and mountains? 
ELIZABETH Believe me, men are either eaten up with arrogance or stupidity. And if they're amiable they're so easily led that they have no minds of their own whatsoever. 
MRS GARDINER Take care, my love, that savours strongly of bitterness. 
ELIZABETH No, they bring nothing but heartache. 
83 INT. BEDROOM - CHEAPSIDE - NIGHT. 83 
As usual Elizabeth and Jane share a bed. They lie next to each other in the darkness 
ELIZABETH I saw Mr Darcy when I was in Rosings. 
JANE Why did you not tell me. Did he mention Mr Bingley. Pause. 
ELIZABETH No. He did not. Elizabeth has never felt more alone in the company of her sister. 
84 EXT. DERBYSHIRE - DAY. 84 
A ravishing landscape of savage and romantic beauty - scudding clouds, mountains, wild rocky outcrops. Elizabeth is walking freely, the wind in her hair. As she nears the peak of a promontory, Mr and Mrs Gardiner are below making their way towards her. They smile at her. She strides off determined to reach the very top. When she gets there she stands with her arms outstretched, her head back laughing into the wind. The view is magnificent. She breathes deeply. 
85 EXT. LAMBTON - DUSK. 85 
An establishing shot of Lambton, a charming market town. Through the window of an inn we see Elizabeth and Mr and Mrs Gardiner at a table. 
86 INT. INN - LAMBTON - NIGHT. 86 
O In the inn, the Gardiner's and Elizabeth are eating supper. An air of high spirits. At the next table, another amiable tourist couple are also tucking into their food. 
MRS GARDINER A handsome face. Lizzie, is it a true likeness of him? 
MRS REYNOLDS Does this young lady know Mr Darcy? 
ELIZABETH Only a little. 
MRS REYNOLDS And do you not think him a handsome man, Miss? 
ELISABETH 
(THOUGHTFULLY) Yes, yes I suppose he is. Mrs Reynolds moves the Gardiners on to another painting, but Elizabeth stays, staring at Darcy's image. 
MRS REYNOLDS And this is his sister, Miss Georgians. She plays and sings all day long. We realize that in the distance we have heard music. Elizabeth is still gazing at the portrait of Darcy, then suddenly snaps out of her reverie, as she processes Mrs 
REYNOLDS SPEECH: 
ELIZABETH â¢ They are at home?! 
MRS REYNOLDS Miss Darcy is always down for the summer. Mr Darcy is due here tomorrow. 
MR GARDINER Is your master much at Pemberley? 
MRS REYNOLDS Not as much as I would wish, sir, or he -- for he dearly loves it here. Relaxed again Elizabeth wanders off as the Gardiners talk to Mrs Reynolds. 
MRS GARDINER If he should marry, you might see more of him. 
MRS REYNOLDS Yes madam, but I do not know when that will be. I do not know a lady who is good enough for him. 
MRS GARDINER What do you mean? 
MRS REYNOLDS I've known Mr Darcy since he was a boy. He was always a kind and generous person even then. Not everyone can see it, because he does not make a meal of it like a lot of young men nowadays. But he is the most sweet-tempered and kind- hearted man I have ever known. 
CUT TO: As the Gardiners look at more paintings, Elizabeth drifts out through the open doors and onto a terrace. In the bright sunlight the view of the gardens and valley beyond is exquisite. Outside the music we heard before is louder. 
92 EXT. TERRACE - PEMBERLY - THE SAME. 92 
Elizabeth wanders aimlessly across the terrace, being unconsciously drawn by the music. Suddenly Elizabeth recognizes the tune (perhaps it is one she has played earlier - but this time it is played exquisitely). She follows the music round a corner, intrigued as she gets â¢ closer and closer to its source. She finally realizes she is outside the room where the music is being played. 
She steals herself a moment, but her curiosity gets the better of her and she discretely peeps in. 
Through the window she sees Georgina Darcy, a beautiful fifteen year old playing the piano with great passion and fluency. She is moved by the music and listens. After sometime, then someone steps into her view but is mostly hidden by shadows in the room. He is directly behind Georgina and gently puts his hands over her eyes. Georgina stops playing and laughs uproariougly. She stands and kisses the figure, the sunlight hits his face. It is Darcy. Georgina and Darcy kiss. Elizabeth is stunned to see him there. Darcy glances up and sees Elizabeth watching him. For a moment they both stare at each other frozen with surprise. Georgina starts in fright at the figure, Elizabeth turns and runs. Darcy comes out after her. 
DARCY Miss Bennet! Elizabeth stops, appallingly embarrassed. Darcy catches up with her. They both blush, deeply. 
ELIZABETH I thought you were in London. 
DARCY 
(STUPIDLY) No... I'm not. 
ELIZABETH No. Another ghastly silence. Then they both speak at once. 
DARCY ELIZABETH I came here a day early - We wouldn't have come - 
DARCY ELIZABETH -- some business with my I'm so terribly sorry - 
STEWARD - They stop. He gazes at her with great emotion. 
ELIZABETH I'm visiting Derbyshire with my uncle and aunt. 
DARCY (trying to recover) And are you having a pleasant trip? 
ELIZABETH Very pleasant. Tomorrow we go to Matlock. 
DARCY â¢ Tomorrow? 
(DISAPPOINTED) Are you staying at Larnbton? 
ELIZABETH Yes. At the Rose and Crown. Another pause. She extends her hand. 
ELIZABETH I'm so sorry to intrude. They said the house was open for visitors. I had no idea... She shakes his hand and starts to walk away. 
DARCY May I see you to the village? 
ELIZABETH Oh no! I'm very fond of walking. 
DARCY Yes. 
MISS BINGLEY In six months I have never seen anyone so altered. How brown and coarse she has become! 
DARCY I perceive no alteration' except she is rather tanned. Hardly a miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer. 
MISS BINGLEY I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, you said "she a beauty? I would have as soon called her mother a wit!" 
DARCY You must have mis-heard, Caroline. Even had I thought it, I would have couched it 
with a little more finesse. Elizabeth looks across at Darcy - they smile at each other. 
95 EXT. DERBYSHIRE - DUSK 95 
Darcy is driving Elizabeth and the Gardiner's back to Lampton. The rugged landscape looks even more beautiful and dramatic in the dusk light. Elizabeth sits up with Darcy who holds the reins, while Mr and Mrs Gardiner sit comfortably in the carriage. Mr Gardiner smiles broadly at two large fish that lie beside him. 
ELIZABETH It is so beautiful up here. I will be sorry to leave. Darcy smiles at her. 
ELIZABETH You have been a most gracious host. I'm sure my aunt and uncle will talk of nothing else for days. 
Â¢ DARCY I have recently thought a great deal about how I appear and act to others. 
She smiles softly at Darcy. 
ELIZABETH It does you credit, sir. 
96 INT. INN -- LAMBTON - NIGHT. 96 
The party arrive back at the inn. 
MR GARDINER (quietly to Elizabeth) What a capital fellow. 
MRS GARDINER Thank you so much Mr Darcy. Darcy is about to take his leave when a servant brings Elizabeth a letter. 
SERVANT 
(TO LIZZIE) For you, madam. 
ELIZABETH 
(DELIGHTED) 107 Its from Jane. 10 â¢ she rips open the letter. 
97 INT. PARLOUR - INN - LAMBTON - THE SAME. 97 
Elizabeth is crying with the open letter in her hand. Darcy and Mr and Mrs Gardiner stand dumb, not quite knowing what to do. Elizabeth tries to speak but bursts into tears again. She cries for a long time. 
DARCY Miss Elizabeth. She cries on. 
DARCY (CONT'D) Miss Elizabeth. She eventually gathers herself. 
ELIZABETH It is the most dreadful news. Lydia has run away - with Mr Wickham. They are gone together from Brighton to Lord knows where. She has no money, no connections, I fear she is lost forever. 
DARCY â¢ (quietly to Elizabeth) This is my fault - if only I had exposed Wickham when I should. 
ELIZABETH No, this is my fault. I might have prevented all of it by merely being open with my sisters rather than too proud with my knowledge. Mr and Mrs Gardiner look at each other perplexed. 
MRS GARDINER Has anything been done to recover her? 
ELIZABETH Father has gone to London. But I know very well that nothing can be done. We have not the smallest hope. 
DARCY Would to heaven that anything could be said or done on my part that could offer consolation to such distress. 
ELIZABETH Sir, it think it is too late. 
MR GARDINER I am afraid we must go at once - I will join Mr Bennet and find Lydia before she ruins the family forever. 
DARCY I am so very sorry. This is grave indeed. I will leave you. Goodbye. Darcy pauses at the door, looks back at Elizabeth and then is gone. 
98 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT. 98 
The Gardiner's carriage racing through the night. 
99 INT. LONGBOURN - MRS BENNET'S BEDROOM - DAY. 99 
Elizabeth, Jane, Mary and Kitty are gathered around Mrs Bennet who has taken to her bed. 
MRS BENNET Why did the Foresters let her out of their sight? I always said they were unfit to have charge of her. 
MARY 
JANE It's to Daddy. It's in uncle's writing. Mr Bennet snatches the letter. 
MR BENNET As it is addressed to me... He tears it open and begins to read, squinting because he has forgotten his glasses. 
MR BENNET (CONT'D) He's found them. 
KITTY Are they married? 
MR BENNET (squinting at the letter) Just wait. I can't make out his script. 
Elizabeth snatches it. 
ELIZABETH Give it to me. (she reads) 
KITTY Are they married? 
ELIZABETH They will be, if father will settle a hundred pounds a year on her. That is Wickham's condition. 
KITTY A hundred pounds! 
ELIZABETH You will agree to this, father? The letter is passed around the other girls. 
MR BENNET Of course I will agree. But how much your uncle has laid on this wretched man already is anybody's guess. 
KITTY What do you mean, Father? 
MR BENNET No man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as a hundred a year. 
ELIZABETH Ah, I see. 
JANE See what? 
MR BENNET Your uncle is very generous. 
ELIZABETH Do you think it a large sum? 
MR BENNET Wickham's a fool if he takes her for less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very - beginning of our relationship. 
JANE Ten thousand! Heaven forbid! 
â¢ 107 INT. MR & MRS BENNET'S BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. It Close on Mrs Bennet's face as she springs out of bed. Pure triumphant joy. 
MRS BENNET Lydia married! And at sixteen too! Ring the bell, Kitty! I must put on my things and tell Lady Lucas! Oh to see her face! And tell the servants they will have a bowl of punch! The other Bennet's are assembled. 
ELIZABETH We should thank our uncle, Mama. 
MRS BENNET And so he should help! He's much richer than us, and he hasn't got any children. 
ELIZABETH 
(ANGRILY) How can you talk like that? Her mother gets to her feet. 
MRS BENNET A daughter, married! 
ELIZABETH Is that all you think about? 
MRS BENNET "Mrs Wickham" - how well it sounds 
ELIZABETH 
(IN DESPERATION) You don't know what he's like 
MRS BENNET Now where will they live? Purvis Lodge might do. Ashworth is vacant of course, but it's too far off, I couldn't bear to have her ten miles from me - 
MR BENNET Before you take any of these houses, Mrs Bennet, let us be clear. Into one house she will never be welcome. Mrs Bennet stares at him. 
â¢ 108 INT. HALLWAY - LONGBOURN - DAY. 108 
Lydia's triumphant face. The cat that's got the cream. She comes into the house with Wickham. Her mother kisses her, effusively. Mr Bennet coldly bows. 
LYDIA - and then we passed Sarah Sims in her carriage so I took off my glove and let my hand just rest on the window frame, so she might see the ring, and then 1 bowed and smiled like anything! Kitty shrieks with envy. Lizzie moves away; she cannot bear it. Wickham catches her eye, but she ignores him. 
109 INT. DINING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 109 
They are taking their seats for dinner. Lydia moves to the head of the table. 
LYDIA Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, for I am the married woman. She sits down and giggles at her sisters. The maid brings â¢ in the food. Lydia holds up her hand, to display her ring to the maid. 
(LOW VOICE) Why was Mr Darcy there? 
LYDIA I'm not supposed to tell. Lizzie abandons her pride. She takes Lydia's hand. 
ELIZABETH Please, Lydia! 
LYDIA Because he paid for it. 
ELIZABETH 
(STARES) For what? 
LYDIA 
(CARELESSLY) The wedding, Wickham's commission. Everything. 
ELIZABETH Everything? 
KITTY 
(CALLS) Lydia! It's your turn! Lydia moves to go. 
LYDIA People kept saying Wickham owed them money, it was so tedious. So Darcy settled his debts but I don't really like him, do you? Lizzie pulls her back. 
ELIZABETH But why did he do it? 
LYDIA 
(SHRUGS) I don't know, do I? Anyway you're not to tell because it's supposed to be our uncle who paid, and he wouldn't have â¢ minded paying, either, because I'm his favorite. 
â¢ She leaves. Giggles and shrieks from the croquet lawn. Elizabeth looks blank with shock. 
111 EXT. BINGLEY'S HOUSE - MAYFAIR -- DAY. 111 
Close on Darcy's grimly determined face. Drawing back, we see that he is walking down a street in Mayfair. He arrives at a house, pauses, and rings the bell. The door is opened. 
BUTLER Mr Darcy. 
DARCY I have some business with Mr Bingley. Darcy goes inside and the door shuts. The camera cranes slowly upstairs until we can see through the first floor window and into the drawing room. Mr Darcy enters and bows to Mr Bingley. He starts to talk in earnest. Bingley looks stunned by what Darcy is relaying to him. We witness the dumbshow of Darcy confessing that he has wronged Jane Bennet. 
112 EXT. LONGBOURN - DAY. 112 
IS Lydia and Wickham are leaving. Mr Bennet stands at a distance. Mrs Bennet sobs as Lydia climbs onto the carriage. 
MRS BENNET Write to me often, my dear'. Wickham takes his leave of Elizabeth. 
WICKHAM Please relay my affections to the Darcy's on your next acquaintance. I am sure he will be pleased to hear things have worked out so well. He joins Lydia. 
LYDIA (through the window) Married women never have much time for writing. My sisters may write to me! They'll have nothing else to do. The Mrs Bennet and the girls watch as the carriage drives away. 
MRS BENNET 
Oh there is nothing so bad as parting with ones children! One seems so forlorn without them. 
ELIZABETH That is the consequence of marrying a daughter. It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single. 
113 EXT. MERYTON VILLAGE - DAY. 113 
Elizabeth and Jane are out shopping with their mother and sisters. Their housekeeper, Mrs Hill, comes out of the butchers shop. 
MRS HILL Did you hear the news, madam? Mr Bingley is returning to Netherfield. A stunned silence. Lizzie glances at Jane. She blushes. 
MRS BENNET Mr Bingley? Mrs Hill indicates a woman in the butcher's shop. 
MRS HILL Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch Of pork, for she expects him tomorrow. 
MRS BENNET Tomorrow? 
(RECOVERING) Not that I care about it. Mr Bingley is nothing to us and I'm sure I never want to see him again. 
(MOVES AWAY) No, we shall not mention a word about it. (comes back to Mrs Hill) Is it quite certain he is coming? 
MRS HILL Yes, madam. I believe he is alone; his sister remains in town. 
MRS BENNET Huh! Come along, girls. Their mother goes into the draper's shop. Jane pauses at the threshold. 
JANE 
BINGLEY Damn and blast, oh buggery, damn. 
117 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 117 
The girls are now spread around the room. Jane in. despair. 
JANE Well, I'm glad that's over. We can now meet as indifferent acquaintances. 
ELIZABETH 
(LAUGHING) Oh yes? Jane, take care. 
JANE You cannot think me so weak as to be in 
danger now. 
ELIZABETH I think you are in great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever. 
JANE I'm sorry, though, that he came with Mr Darcy. 
ELIZABETH 
(BLURTS OUT) Oh Jane, I have acted so stupidly. Had I been in love, I could not have been more blind! 
JANE 
(STARES) What do you mean? The door bell rings. 
KITTY (at the window) It is him. He's back. He's come again. â¢ A stunned reaction. 
CUT TO: 
Everyone has regained their decorous positions. They hear 
Bingley's voice at the door and he comes in very awkwardly. He smiles. His face is crimson with embarrassment. 
BINGLEY I, erm, I know this is all very embarrassing, but I would like to request the privilege of speaking to Miss Jane - They all look at him. 
BINGLEY (CONT'D) - alone. 
MRS BENNET Girls. Everybody to the kitchen. Immediately. Oh, Mr Bingley. It is so good to see you again so soon. She ushers everyone out, not before squeezing Jane's hand. Now Jane and Bingley are alone, facing each other with extreme embarrassment. 
BINGLEY Miss Bennet, you have been the victim of a huge misunderstanding. Suffice to say, I have been an unmitigated and comprehensive ass. And therefore, I would like to ask you - 
CUT TO: 
118 INT. HALLWAY - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 118 
Mrs Bennet, Kitty, Mary and Mr Bennet are all jostling for a position at the door in order to overhear events inside. 
MARY Ssssshhh! Elizabeth is apart from her family. She cannot bear to be there. She walks down the corridor and out of the house into the garden. Through a window she sees Bingley on one knee, her eyes fill with tears as she walks away from the house. 
- CUT TO: 
119 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 119 
â¢ Bingley looks at Jane, desperately worried. A pause. 
JANE â¢ Yes. A hundred times - yes. Mrs Bennet and the girls throw open the double doors to the drawing room and come crashing in. Bingley and Jane beam at them. 
MRS BENNET Thank the Lord for that. I thought it would never happen. 
120 EXT. GARDEN -- LONGBOURN -- THE SAME. 120 
Elizabeth is sat under a tree crying. 
121 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - OVER LOOKING LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 121 
Darcy looks down at Longbourn. 
122 INT. BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 122 
Mr Bennet and Mrs Bennet are in bed. 
MR BENNET I am sure they will do well together, 
their tempers are much alike. They will be cheated assiduously by their servants, and be so generous with the rest, they will always exceed their income. 
ELIZABETH Your Ladyship declared it to be impossible. 
LADY CATHERINE Let me be understood. Mr Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say? 
ELIZABETH Only this - if that is the case you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me. 
LADY CATHERINE Oh obstinate girl! This union has been planned since their infancy. Do you think it can be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to his family? Whose own sister's elopement resulted in the scandalously patched-up marriage, only achieved at the expense of your uncle? Heaven and earth, are the shades of Pemberly to be thus polluted? Now tell me once and for all, are you engaged to him? 
ELIZABETH I am not. 
LADY CATHERINE And will you promise never to enter into such an engagement? 
ELIZABETH I will not. And I certainly never shall. Allow me to say, the arguments which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have, insulted me in every possible method and can now have nothing further to say. I must ask you to leave immediately. Good night. Elizabeth throws open.the door, revealing the family outside. 
LADY CATHERINE I have never been thus treated in my entire life. Lady Catherine storms past the family and out into the night. Elizabeth is standing shaking with the excitement of having stood so firmly up for herself. 
MR BENNET Lizzie, what on earth is going on? 
ELIZABETH Just a small misunderstanding. She walks past them to bed. 
MRS BENNET Lizzie! 
ELIZABETH For once in your life. Just leave me alone. Everyone looks aghast at Elizabeth's reaction. 
126 INT. BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 126 
Jane is fast asleep. Elizabeth unable to sleep. She quietly climbs out of bed and creeps out of the room. 
127 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN -- THE SAME. 127 
Elizabeth sits alone downstairs, thinking. Outside we see dawn is breaking. 
128 EXT. LONGBOURN - DAWN. 128 
Elizabeth creeps out into the garden and wanders around through the early morning mist, as the sun starts to rise. 
129 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE OVERLOOKING LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 129 
Elizabeth walks out into the open countryside. The mists are starting to evaporate. From out of the mist in the distance a figure emerges. Her heart misses a beat. She is alone, vulnerable. Then she sees it is Darcy. 
ELIZABETH Mr Darcy! 
DARCY What are you doing out here so early? 
ELIZABETH I could not sleep. 
DARCY Me neither. I have been up.most of the night. 
Elizabeth hardly knows how to react at this unexpected meeting. Rather politely she thanks Mr Darcy. 
ELIZABETH Mr Darcy, I must thank you for your unexampled generosity to both my sisters. I know what kindnesses you have done for poor Lydia and suspect your hand in the happy resolution for Jane also. 
DARCY I am alarmed that you know of what I have been so in earnest to keep silent. But you must know that your happiness was one of my prime inducements. Elizabeth looks at Darcy. 
DARCY (CONT`D) I know you are too generous to trifle with me. I believe you spoke with my Aunt last night, and it has taught me to hope as I had scarcely allowed myself before. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, but 
one word from you will silence me forever. 
Elizabeth is silent. 
DARCY (CONT'D) If, however, your feelings have changed... Elizabeth gazes at him. 
DARCY (CONT'D) I would have to tell you, you have bewitched me body and soul and I love and love and love you. And never wish to be parted from you from this day on. Elizabeth looks at him. She does not say a word. Darcy is staring at her for a reply. A tear rolls down Elizabeth's cheek. 
ELIZABETH I am very happy to inform you that not only have my sentiments changed there are no other words which could give me greater pleasure. Darcy stares at her. They both start to cry. Darcy very, very slowly and gently touches her face. She closes her eyes. They kiss. She touches his face with her hand, the kiss becomes passionate. 
130 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DUSK. 130 
The place is in an uproar. Bingley, Jane, Mary, Kitty, Mr and Mrs Bennet are all gathered, fretting terribly about Elizabeth's whereabouts. Through a window we see Elizabeth lead Darcy along the duck board plank across the moat. Elizabeth enters the house, everybody starts.

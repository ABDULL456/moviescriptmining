EXT. COLUMBUS, OHIO - DAY 
The state capital of Ohio.  It's an impressive building for a city this size. 
SUPERTITLE: COLUMBUS, OHIO - STATE CAPITAL 
INT. OHIO STATE SUPREME COURT - DAY 
In chambers striving for august, JUSTICES listen to a lawyer MR. RODMAN, argue his case before the highest court in Ohio. Mr. Rodman enjoys the sound of his own voice. 
MR. RODMAN This informant, paid by the police, using taxpayers dollars to continue his felony drug habit, was the link which allowed police to raid a private farm.  A working farm.  A farm where honest Americans make their living. 
One particular justice, ROBERT WAKEFIELD, younger than the others, is clearly bemused by this performance. 
MR. RODMAN The government, in its haste, has employed an army of criminals whose allegiance to the truth is, at best, questionable -- 
Judge Wakefield interrupts -- 
ROBERT Mr. Rodman...it's too bad your client didn't show as much sense in choosing what he planted as he did in choosing his attorney... 
A polite chuckle from the justices -- 
ROBERT Lately the only variation I'm hearing in your argument is the name of the client.  And you can sit there all day arguing the ins and outs of Illinois v. Gates, but you aren't going to convince me that this country has not sanctioned the use of anonymous informants. (beat) Furthermore, there is no sacred protection of property rights in the United Sates.  When you make the decision to have marijuana on your farm, whether it's one joint or an acre of plants, your property can be seized and your property can be sold. 
MR. RODMAN I'm sorry the court finds my argument repetitious. 
ROBERT Mr. Rodman, may I offer a piece of advice?  The next time you argue this point before this court, regardless of my whereabouts, I recommend you have something up your sleeve other than your arm. 
INT. ROBERT'S CHAMBERS - DAY 
The office is marble and dark wood.  A young CLERK, black, 29, enters carrying an oddly-shaped gift.  They both look at it. 
CLERK What do you think it is? 
ROBERT Depends who it's from. 
CLERK (reading the card) Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson. 
ROBERT You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me. (re: the elaborate box) Definitely third category. 
CLERK What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar? 
ROBERT Depends on the state. 
CLERK (checks) Arizona. 
ROBERT Medicinal marijuana initiative. (beat) Or am I being cynical? 
They both laugh.  Robert reaches up and pulls a bottle of Scotch from a shelf.  He pours a couple of fingers in two glasses. 
CLERK Maybe there's a book in it. 
The clerk takes one of the glasses. 
ROBERT Not by me. 
They toast and drink. 
EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY 
Robert exits, trailed by a small group of reporters.  He gets into a car being driven by two security TYPES. 
INT. AIRPLANE - DAY 
Robert sits in a business class window seat. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
An expensive hotel.  Robert Wakefield stands at the window, looking at the view of our nation's capital. 
SUPERTITLE: WASHINGTON D.C. 
ON THE TABLE 
The remnants of a meal.  It was a steak and a small caesar salad.  The wine glass is half-empty. 
ANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT 
In front of the mirror now, trying on a dark, tasteful jacket. 
CLOSER 
On Robert in the same position, only now we are in HIS HOME. It's daytime, and his wife BARBARA is helping him into this same jacket.  As her hands dust the lint off his shoulders 
WE MATCH CUT TO: 
ROBERT 
In the hotel rooms, making the same motions.  Satisfied, he straightens, then turns to look at himself. 
OMITTED 
ANGLE ON ROBERT 
SALAZAR (to Javi) One question.  How did you find about this? 
JAVIER An informant. 
SALAZAR What is the name of your informant? 
JAVIER (beat) It was an anonymous tip. 
Salazar looks at Javi a beat. 
SALAZAR (to his men) For a State Police officer, you're very well informed.  Let's go. 
MOMENTS LATER Javi and Manolo watch the convoy of vehicles drive away. 
Javier lights a cigarette. 
MANOLO Wasn't that General Salazar? 
JAVIER Yeah. 
MANOLO What's he doing up here? 
JAVIER I don't know.  Something. 
They start for their car.

EXT. DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - DAY 
SUPERTITLE: SAN DIEGO 
Two men, RAY CASTRO, 30's, proud, ambitious, and MONTEL GORDON, 40's, suspicious of everyone including himself and always, always the smartest guy in the room, walk from a Lincoln Towncar toward a dumpy office.  Castro is talking under his breath -- 
CASTRO No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways. (beat) How're you feeling? 
GORDON (keyed up) I feel good. 
CASTRO No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh? 
GORDON Nope. 
Castro stretches his arms, swings them around. 
CASTRO Limbering up, gonna stay loose, keep it all together.  Take this motherfucker down. 
They reach the door to the office.  Gordon looks at Castro, then turns the handle. 
CASTRO Showtime. 
INT. OFFICE, DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - DAY 
It's a cluttered, rundown working office unusual only in the extent of its ordinariness.  A SECRETARY goes about her business like a somnambulist.  CLERKS shuffle and file. 
Castro switches into Spanish -- 
CASTRO (in Spanish) Good afternoon, ladies, gentlemen. We're looking for Eduardo Ruiz.  We have a two o'clock appointment. 
INT. OFFICE, DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - LATER 
In a back alcove, Castro and Gordon sit across a cheap table from EDUARDO RUIZ, 40's, an entrepreneur in an expensive suit and bad hairpiece.  They are waiting. 
RUIZ You ever buy a quarter ton?  Not many people have. 
Another "businessman" enters from another door and whispers in Ruiz's ear, then leaves again. 
RUIZ So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have an airlift?  It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right?  How many peasants would that take?  A line stretching from here to Mexico City -- 
GORDON Nobody said shit, Eduardo -- 
One of Ruiz's hands dips under the desk where we see a handgun is holstered on the underside. 
RUIZ Relax.  We're waiting, that's it. 
CASTRO Hey, you want to hear a joke?  I got a joke.  Why do women wear makeup and perfume? 
GORDON Chill out -- 
CASTRO It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick.  Why do women wear makeup and perfume? 
RUIZ I don't know. 
CASTRO 'Cause they're ugly and they stink. 
Castro laughs uproariously. 
INT. DEA SURVEILLANCE SPACE - DAY 
ON FUZZY SURVEILLANCE VIDEO: Castro laughing.  Ruiz politely smiling, one of his hands hidden by the table. 
GORDON Man, you never been close enough to a woman to know how she smells. 
DEA AGENT (V.O.) What's his hand doing?  Watch his hand.  Anybody?  I don't like the hand. 
IN THE OFFICE 
The room is filled with crappy surveillance equipment.  DEA AGENTS, in DEA logo'd outerwear, jiggle a monitor fuzzily displaying the view from another hidden camera: Gordon and Ruiz around the cheap table. 
DEA AGENT This is ridiculous this fucking thing. (taps monitor) Look at this shit -- the first television transmission.  I had better shit when I was the AV guy at junior high, swear-to-God. 
ANOTHER DEA AGENT Come on, Castro, pay attention. Watch his damn hands. 
ON THE MONITOR 
Everyone laughs.  Helena is by far the youngest in her crowd. 
ALEX It's a very fatty bird.  All that winter insulation.  Just like me. 
NAN You mean all breast, just like you. 
ALEX You're bad -- 
NAN (singsong) Jealous, that's all -- 
HELENA I've heard... I can't remember where... That it's full of that good kind of fat, the kind you're supposed to eat -- 
STEWIE Unsaturated fat -- 
TWO WOMEN IN UNISON Polyunsaturated. 
HELENA And now there's a good cholesterol and bad cholesterol.  Everything they tell you completely changes every other week.  I don't know why they think we should listen at all. 
NAN What I know is ducks, as cute as they are, were designed by God to be eaten. 
Nan reaches for a taste and the other women lean forward also, a sea of inanity swirling around Helena's salad. 
EXT. COUNTRY CLUB PARKING LOT - DAY 
Helena buckles her little boy, DAVID, 5, into the front seat of her Mercedes.  He won't let go of his putter. 
HELENA I'll put this in the back. 
DAVID No -- 
HELENA All the professionals keep them in the trunk. 
DAVID Not Tiger Woods. 
HELENA Especially Tiger Woods. (sharing a secret) ...Actually, he keeps his on the back seat. 
She pulls the putter away from the reluctant boy and sets it on the back seat. 
EXT. HOTEL - DAY 
A modern high-rise on the waterfront playground of San Diego. 
Helena passes the hotel in her car. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
A standard room looking out at the water which is dotted with sailboats and cruise ships.  The bed is covered with hi- tech surveillance equipment. 
The equipment salesman, LONNIE, 40's, who makes a fetish of gadgetry, explains the finer points of operation to FRANCISCO "FRANKIE" FLORES, 30's, sallow, watery-eyed, in expensive clothes. 
LONNIE Gates, Myrhvold, Bezos.  I sell to all those guys.  Why?  Because the technology to intrude has reached the masses.  Your competitor, your ex-spouse, adversaries, stalkers, they're at the local electronics store right now, and they're gonna be intruding on you not only through your telephone, but your fax, cell phone, pager, cable TV, Musak, windows, walls, air conditioning ventilation, modem, and internet connection. 
He walks over to the bed and the sexy equipment -- 
LONNIE Nobody has these babies, no way, not the shiznit. 
Frederico picks up a piece of equipment. 
FRANCISCO I want to intercept cell phone calls, digital and analog.  And locate the source of the call.  I need databasing capability, to cross-reference calls and numbers. 
Lonnie lovingly picks up a laptop computer with a sleek device attached to it -- 
LONNIE Your Cellular Secretary, friend across all the digital wireless spread spectrum. (beat) So, Francisco, what do you do?  You a PI?  Private security? 
Francisco looks at Lonnie coldly. 
FRANCISCO Assassin. 
LONNIE (not missing a beat) Assassin, okay.  Let's get you started in surveillance. 
EXT. GEORGETOWN BROWNSTONE - NIGHT 
The house takes up most of one of the nicest blocks.  PEOPLE enter and party VOICES drift out. 
SUPERTITLE: GEORGETOWN, WASHINGTON, D.C. 
INT. GEORGETOWN BROWNSTONE - NIGHT 
A power cocktail party in full swing.  This is where most of the business in Washington gets done. 
Robert, scotch in hand, listens to a smug PHARMACEUTICAL LOBBYIST explain the world. 
PHARMACEUTICAL LOBBYIST We in the legal drug business, and I mean Merck, Pfizer, the rest of my very powerful clients, realize this isn't a war with a traditional winner and loser, but an organism at war with itself, whose weapons of mass destruction happen to be intoxicants. And if you want a body count look no further than alcohol which racks up 80,000 kills a year.  Cocaine manages a measly 2,000.  Same for Heroin. But, the big daddy is Big Tobacco which kills 380,000 each year, which, by the way, is more people than have been killed by all the illegal drugs in the last century. 
ROBERT (faking it) That's very interesting. 
The lobbyist smiles.  Robert sips his drink. 
ANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT 
In another room.  Listening to STAN, overweight advocate for the United States Council of Chambers of Commerce. 
STAN It's time, Robert, to choke some honesty out of these rural legislators; get'em to fess up that it's pretty much Prisons or Casinos in terms of their choices for economic growth. 
ANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT 
listening to ETHAN, earnest advocate of harm reduction. 
ETHAN What's the difference between Prozac and Ecstacy, you ask?  One's a mattress and the other's a trampoline. Molecules don't have morality. Really, think about it: some molecule changes the way a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor works, it's not suddenly a bad molecule; it's just a molecule. My theory: America has a real fear of short, intense experiences. 
Robert turns away -- 
ROBERT (under his breath) Like you. 
ANOTHER ROOM Robert at the bar getting another scotch.  A secretive man, TIM, 40's, nerdy, sidles up beside him and whispers furtively in his ear. 
TIM (whispering) Chemicals?  Some say problems, others say solution.  Imagine a cloud that when it rains prohibits the growth of poppies or takes the THC out of marijuana.  Imagine a pill that eliminates any psychological craving, from Dilaudid to Dove Bars.  Law enforcement hasn't let science sit on the sidelines.  Addiction is no more relevant than polio or the Black Plague. 
EXT. AYALA HOME - LA JOLLA - DAY 
A starter castle high in the hills near Mount Soledad, an exclusive neighborhood with views of the ocean.  Joggers jog to the SOUNDS of tennis and Jacuzzis gurgling, and lawn care equipment operated by Mexicans. 
Behind the Ayala gate we see David playing with his golf club on the lush lawn. 
Workers set-up the party under the direction of a professional party planner. 
A BMW 740il with tinted windows pulls into the driveway. 
DAVID Daddy! 
The window lowers and we see CARL AYALA, 40's, handsome, charismatic, second generation American, in expensive, conservative clothes, covering his cell phone as he greets his kids. 
CARL Hello.  Hello. 
He goes back to his phone call, pulling around to the garage. David goes back to his game. 
INT. AYALA DINING ROOM - DAY 
There are MAIDS in the house and a COOK in the kitchen.  The large rooms are filled with fine art. 
Helena Ayala sits at the dining room table with plans, bills and receipts spread before her.  Carl enters and paces around the room, continuing his cell phone conversation. 
CARL (into phone) I'm sorry, Jonas.  I don't care if that is the price you have gotten in order countries. 
Helena watches her husband pace as he talks.  He can't help it, but a portion of this call is theatrical, for an audience's benefit, which in this instance happens to be his wife.  Helena's expression of annoyance resets itself into love. 
CARL This is America, a different country. I am Carl, a different man.  So you see, everything about our situation is different and I believe the pricing will be different, too. (beat, listens) You're a reasonable man... So take the weekend to think about it. 
Carl clicks off the phone, turns to Helena. 
CARL Every day with this guy is like starting all over again. 
Carl winds down and finally becomes present in the room with his wife.  He looks at her.  She looks back. 
CARL Hi. 
HELENA Hi. 
CARL What's up? 
HELENA Just watching you. 
CARL I got that.  How was your day? 
She pushes the topiary away from her.  Suddenly, she seems tired.  Carl comes over and puts his hand on her pregnant belly. 
CARL You all right? 
HELENA I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something. 
Her husband watches her, then wraps his arms around her. 
EXT. AYALA HOME - DAY 
Carl and Helena step out on the front porch of their home and watch David play with his golf putter. 
OUTSIDE THEIR GATE 
An unmarked police car rolls up and stops behind the wall. Another arrives and another and another.  OFFICERS in DEA jackets exit the cars. 
There is MURMURING, then SILENCE. 
Helena slowly turns to look at her husband.  He doesn't look at her. 
HELENA David, come inside -- 
Suddenly, POLICE and DEA enter the front yard.  Gordon and Castro enter the yard and move quickly up the drive to Carl. 
CARL What is this?  What is going on? 
GORDON Mr. Ayala? 
CARL That's right. 
GORDON You're under arrest for violation of Federal Narcotics laws. 
Gordon and Castro spin him, cuff him, and without emotion begin pulling him from his yard.  David is trying to get to his father.  In a kind of shock.  Helena trails after him. 
Castro drags Carl into the street toward the open door of the cruiser.  He pushes him down into the backseat. 
GORDON We have a warrant to search your home, Mrs. Ayala. 
Gordon hits the side of the cruiser and it pulls away.  Carl looks at his wife through the window. 
Gordon and Castro head up the driveway toward her house. 
Helena is left standing in the street.  NEIGHBORS, who have appeared in front yards and at the ends of driveways, stare at her with suspicion.  David approaches and holds onto her leg.

INT. SALAZAR'S HEADQUARTERS - ANTEROOM - DAY 
Javi and Manolo wait in Salazar's anteroom.  A ceiling fan swirls the air.  After a moment the door opens and an AIDE motions to them.  They stand. 
AIDE (to Manolo) Not you.  You. 
Javi goes into the room. 
INT. SALAZAR'S OFFICE - DAY 
The office is Spartan and military.  Salazar and Javi sit facing each other.  Salazar looks at a piece of paper. 
SALAZAR Javier Rodriguez.  Twenty-nine years- old.  Graduated from Montessori school.  Five years as a beat cop in TJ.  Three years with the State Police.  Parents died four years ago in their apartment from carbon monoxide poisoning because they could not afford to fix their gas heater. Your sister works in a Maquiladora in Juarez, making designer blue-jeans. On the police force three years, you currently make 316 dollars a month. 
They all look at each other.  Caroline sips her wine. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SAN DIEGO JAIL - DAY 
In the intake area of a busy San Diego precinct, Helena sits on a bench and regroups.  Detectives move past her. Handcuffed criminals are separated, bagged and tagged. 
beautifully dressed man, ARNIE METZGER, 30's, super- lawyer, knows everyone from the top of the system to the bottom, slick but likable, smart and ruthless, too, separates himself from a DETECTIVE he's gladhanding and approaches Helena. 
ARNIE Helena, I'm so sorry -- 
HELENA Arnie, thank God. 
Metzger sits, giving her a hug. 
HELENA Can you please tell me what on earth is going on? 
Arnie looks at her as if to say, "do you really not know?" 
Then, he speaks quietly with his hand in front of his mouth. 
ARNIE I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good. 
HELENA Why are you talking like that? 
ARNIE Listen to me carefully.  First of all, Carl isn't here.  DEA's got him and they'll hang on to him until arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow.  So here you're wasting your time.  Are you with me? 
He checks to see if this is registering. 
ARNIE Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it? 
HELENA Arnie, this is crazy. 
He makes eye contact with her. 
ARNIE Got it? (she slowly nods) Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard. 
HELENA What is he being charged with? 
ARNIE I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important. 
HELENA Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass. 
ARNIE That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children. 
EXT. BUILDING PARKING LOT - DAY 
Helena exits.  Her expression is set as she drives.  She turns a corner in the shopping district, passing JAVIER AND MANOLO who are walking down the street.  Tourists, drunk Marines and the homeless piss away another day. 
We follow them into a bar with blackened windows and a discrete sign. 
INT. BAR - DAY 
This is a place where men come to meet men.  And it's already lively even at this early hour.  Javier and Manolo find a seat and wait. 
LATER Javi is working on his second beer when he seems to recognize somebody. 
ACROSS THE ROOM 
Francisco "Frankie" Flowers has entered the bar.  Javi watches him circulate through the room then settle at the bar.  Javier finishes his beer, rises, and takes the empty seat next to Francisco.  Manolo watches. 
Very quickly Javi strikes up a conversation.  We don't hear what they're saying but it doesn't matter because Francisco clearly likes Javi. 
Off Francisco's anticipatory smile -- 
OMITTED 
OMITTED 
EXT. MILITARY BASE - MEXICO - DAY 
The back of a blue van opens and a blindfolded Francisco falls onto the ground. 
Surrounding him are Javi and Salazar, who watch as two of Salazar's MEN drag Francisco away toward an abandoned mission- style building. 
SALAZAR (clearly pleased with Javi) I'm curious how you did this with such economy. 
JAVIER Everybody has a weakness. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SOMEBODY'S PARENTS' MANSION, CINCINNATI - NIGHT 
With its old-growth trees and manipulated shrubbery, the large house is shrouded in the mystery of well-heeled suburbia.  It is very late. 
INT. SOMEBODY'S PARENTS' MANSION - NIGHT 
Somebody's parents are out of town and the house feels empty. Big empty rooms with expensive furniture nobody sits on. 
Faint MUSIC echoes through the house. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
High ceilings of a 1930's kitchen.  Vodka bottles and cranberry juice and limes are spilled across a counter.  ON THE RHODES AGAIN by Morcheeba plays from a jam-box on a counter. 
Maybe ten TEENAGERS are partying hard in this kitchen.  It's weird and disassociated, people wandering in and out, playing with kitchen utensils, heavily fucked up. 
There are drugs on a mirror on the eat-in table.  Caroline and Seth and two friends sit around this table.  VANESSA, 16, almost pretty, is hitting a freebase pipe and holds the hit.  FUCKED-UP BOWMAN, 17, super-preppy with a wan, Baby Huey face, takes a slug of vodka. 
They are jittery, sweaty, tweaked, fucked-up -- 
CAROLINE All I'm saying, what I'm saying, is it never seems like anybody ever says anything that matters to them, like we all look at each other and nod with responses we've been trained to make, not real responses, just social conventions, phony, fake smiles, surface bullshit... I mean, we're all smart and do we have any idea what each other are like, really like?  Do I know what Seth's afraid of, or Vanessa, or fucked-up Bowman? 
Everyone looks at Fucked-up Bowman who grinds his jaw appreciatively -- 
CAROLINE ...Probably, but do I ever say this stuff, just say, "hey, I'm uncomfortable in this crowd, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, either? I know you're afraid and it's okay-- 
Javier stands guard outside a door, listening  to the strangulated SCREAMS of Francisco.  He's sickened. 
ACROSS THE COURTYARD 
Manolo ignores Francisco's CRIES, while shooting the shit with several of Salazar's MEN, who laugh appreciatively at something he's said. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. AYALA HOME, SAN DIEGO - NIGHT 
Valet parkers in uniform work the driveway.  The party is ablaze and there are lights in the trees.  A Lester Lanin- like band plays a STANDARD that drifts across the grounds. 
EXT. AYALA HOME - NIGHT 
A conservative monied crowd mingles.  Helena is talking with a GROUP of rich people who include her friends, Nan, Stewie and Alex, from the country-club, and their HUSBANDS. 
STEWIE This is fabulous, Helena.  What a turnout. 
HELENA Thank you so much, but I had a lot of help. 
Helena circles away.  As Helena leaves, the women speak their minds -- 
NAN It's a turnout because it's a spectacle.  Can you imagine? 
ALEX I've met her husband, as nice as they come. 
STEWIE It teaches me a valuable lesson... (re: the nice house) Apparently crime pays. 
NAN Silly, you knew that already. 
ON THE STAGE 
The band stops playing and steps aside as a man in a tuxedo takes the microphone.  Behind the band is a huge "A.L.A. - Adult Literacy Advocates" Banner. 
TUXEDO Hello. Thank you.  Thank you all. I have the results of the silent auction... 
CUT TO: 
INT. JUVENILE DETENTION, CINCINNATI - HOLDING CELL - MORNING 
Caroline Wakefield lies on a bench in a grey-walled holding cell.  She wears paper slippers and her belt has been removed. Even youth can't disguise her hangover. 
INT. SOCIAL WORKER OFFICE - MORNING 
Caroline is perched on the edge of her chair.  Across the desk from her is a tired SOCIAL WORKER, 40's, who has been assigned Caroline's case and is giving her the "exit" interview. 
SOCIAL WORKER ...How old are you? 
CAROLINE Sixteen 
SOCIAL WORKER Live with your parents? 
CAROLINE Yes. 
SOCIAL WORKER Parents still together? 
CAROLINE Yes. 
SOCIAL WORKER Do you work? 
CAROLINE I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours. 
SOCIAL WORKER In school? 
CAROLINE Cincinnati Country Day. 
The Social worker looks up from her questionnaire and sees Caroline for the first time. 
SOCIAL WORKER Private? 
CAROLINE Yeah. 
SOCIAL WORKER How are your grades? 
CAROLINE I'm third in my class. 
SOCIAL WORKER What's that mean? 
CAROLINE I get A's.  All A's. 
SOCIAL WORKER You do?  What else you do? 
CAROLINE (her college resume) I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team. 
The social worker pushes the forms she's filling out away and looks again at Caroline -- 
SOCIAL WORKER You wanna tell me what you're doing here, Caroline? 
INT. JUVENILE DETENTION - MORNING 
A cold institutional lobby with hard plastic chairs and bad lighting.  Government workers move behind thick glass windows with tiny mesh screens cut into them for talking. 
Barbara Wakefield sits on one of the uncomfortable chairs. She's alone and has been crying.  There's the sound of heavily locked doors OPENING and Caroline appears. 
Barbara stands and wraps Caroline in her arms. 
BARBARA Oh, honey.  Are you all right? 
Caroline begins to cry into her mother's chest. 
EXT. JUVI JAIL - MORNING 
It's an early morning as Barbara Wakefield escorts her daughter from the bland government building. 
CAROLINE Did you tell Dad? 
BARBARA Not yet. 
Caroline leaves the study and shuts the door harder than necessary. 
Robert and Barbara look at each other, raising their eyebrows and breathing deeply -- 
ROBERT I think she's lying. 
BARBARA Me, too. 
ROBERT (reaching a decision) We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing. 
BARBARA Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried -- 
ROBERT Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that. 
BARBARA Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is? 
ROBERT This is different. 
BARBARA Why? 
ROBERT To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old. 
BARBARA I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space -- 
ROBERT Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct? 
BARBARA We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences. 
Robert looks at his wife, then it dawns on him. 
ROBERT How long have you known about this? 
No response. 
ROBERT (yelling) How long have you known? 
BARBARA Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank -- 
ROBERT Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent. 
BARBARA She asked me not to. 
He leaves the room. 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Robert is in the hallway, at Caroline's door.  He opens it and we get BLASTED WITH MUSIC. 
Caroline is sitting in a rocking chair with headphones on. She faces the window and moves back and forth, back and forth. 
Robert calls her name, but the SOUNDTRACK is drowning him out. 
He calls again, this time apparently loud enough for her to hear.  She takes the headphones off - the MUSIC stops - and turns to look at him.  Or rather, she looks right through him, as though he didn't exist.  Robert is so taken aback by the coldness of her gaze that he doesn't speak. 
She turns away from him and puts the headphones back on. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MILITARY BASE - MEXICO - DAY 
Javier and Salazar walk across the base.  Salazar is feeling ebullient and it shows. 
SALAZAR You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog. 
JAVIER But will he be house-trained? 
SALAZAR When he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here. He will freely give the names of his superiors.  Then we get them and they too will give us names.  And eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will fall. 
They enter the barracks. 
INT. CELL - MEXICAN MILITARY BASE - DAY 
It's pitch black in the cell.  There's a human in here, but we can't see him. 
Suddenly the door is thrown open and light floods in, illuminating a very broken Francisco Flores. 
The figure of Commander Salazar fills the doorway. 
SALAZAR This is shameful.  A disgrace. Francisco Flores -- 
Francisco cowers in the corners -- 
SALAZAR It's all right, son.  It's all right. Salazar is here.  You're among gentlemen, now.  This shameful treatment will stop immediately. (calling out) Guard! 
A GUARD appears in the doorway.  Francisco is spooked. 
SALAZAR I want to know who is responsible for this treatment. 
GUARD Yes, sir! 
SALAZAR We aren't barbarians. 
GUARD Yes, sir! 
SALAZAR Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?

INT. COURTHOUSE, SAN DIEGO - DAY 
A packed courthouse.  Carl is at the defense table.  He doesn't look at Helena who sits in the gallery next to Arnie Metzger. 
EXT. LA JOLLA PLAYGROUND - DAY 
Helena reads a book, Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert, and keeps an eye on David, who is playing on the monkey bars. 
ACROSS THE ROAD at a careful distance is the ubiquitous telephone repair van.  On the roof a parabolic mike swivels around. 
INT. TELEPHONE REPAIR VAN - DAY 
Castro and Gordon watch Helena via a small surveillance monitor. 
GORDON You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona. 
CASTRO Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here. 
GORDON He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you. 
CASTRO Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers? 
Gordon looks at the monitor -- 
GORDON What do we have here? 
ON THE MONITOR: David kicking a soccer ball with an older strange man, TIGRILLO, Latino, 40's, fit and tough looking. 
The man is very good.  He juggles the ball and bounces it off his head and David follows him away from the center of the playground. 
EXT. PLAYGROUND - CONTINUOUS 
Helena notices David moving away while playing with the man. She follows, then begins to jog after them. 
HELENA David, come back here this minute. David! 
As she closes distance the man stops juggling the ball and abruptly picks up David and begins swinging him around by his arms.  David is having fun as Helena approaches. 
HELENA David -- 
DAVID We're playing! 
The strange man swings David up so that he's under his arm. 
STRANGE MAN Yeah, this is fun. 
HELENA Please put down my son. 
The man holds David. 
STRANGE MAN Shouldn't let your kid wander off with strangers. 
HELENA Thank you.  That's a valuable lesson. David, come on. 
The strange man holds David tighter so that he's no longer having fun.  He begins to wriggle -- 
STRANGE MAN Mrs. Ayala -- 
This gets her attention -- 
STRANGE MAN Your husband owes a lot of money. Enough that snapping this kid's neck wouldn't nearly cover it. 
David begins to cry.  Helena looks around wildly for help. 
STRANGE MAN You better come up with it in a hurry or your kid is going to disappear, and he won't turn up until the evening news. 
He drops David who runs to his mother. 
STRANGE MAN You get exactly one warning. 
The strange man moves away across the field. 
STRANGE MAN The first payment is three million dollars. 
He continues walking away. 
INT. TELEPHONE REPAIR VAN - DAY 
Gordon and Castro stare with rapt attention. 
GORDON Are you getting this on tape? 
CASTRO I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.

JAVIER Your new friends. 
MANOLO Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come? 
JAVIER Not this time. 
INT. DINING HALL - BARRACKS - NIGHT 
Francisco and Salazar eat at a beautifully set table.  They are waited on by military officers who serve perfect flan at the end of the meal. 
FRANCISCO In my home I have B&W speakers.  I recently purchased a compact disc burner.  I can make my own cd's, with whatever music I like, as if I bought them at the store, only I don't have to pay these crazy prices. 
SALAZAR We have much in common.  We both attended school in the United States, and both of our fathers are engineers. 
FRANCISCO I got into stereo equipment when I was a kid.  Some people don't notice the difference but it is very important to me. 
EXT. AYALA HOME - AFTERNOON 
Helena carries the cups down the driveway.  She presses a button and the gates swing open. 
INT. TELEPHONE REPAIR VAN - AFTERNOON 
Gordon and Castro listen to their headsets.  Suddenly -- 
VOICE (O.S.) (over their headsets) Okay.  She's coming out.  She's leaving her property.  Okay, she seems to be heading for the van! She is approaching the van! 
Castro and Gordon looks at each other. 
GORDON What do we do? 
CASTRO I don't know. 
There's a KNOCKING at the door of the van. 
GORDON What do you think she wants? 
CASTRO She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids. 
Gordon opens the door.  Helena is standing there with the lemonade. 
HELENA I so hope I didn't startle you.  I thought you might like some cold lemonade. 
GORDON Uh... Thank you. 
She hands the cups to him.  Helena gathers herself. 
HELENA I know this is a difficult situation and you're only doing your jobs.  I don't bear you any ill-will, but I do have a small favor to ask. 
CASTRO You want to ask us a favor? 
HELENA A man threatened my children. These charges have attracted a lot of attention and it seems to be bringing all the nut-jobs out of the nut jar. (beat) Would you keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary.  I don't know what else to do. 
GORDON Of course, we will. 
HELENA Thank you. 
They shut the door to the van and sit for a moment. 
CASTRO It's probably poisoned. 
Gordon takes a big sip of his. 
GORDON It's good.  Not too sweet.

Anna walks up the stairs of a rundown building.  She passes two PROSTITUTES loitering in the stairwell. 
She knocks on a door and Javi, half-dressed for work, answers. He's surprised to see her. 
JAVIER Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want? 
ANNA I can't find Manolo.

JAVIER No. 
He lets her into the apartment. 
INT. JAVI'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Javi slams Manolo against the side of building.

Manolo is sweaty and crazy-eyed. 
MANOLO It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with. 
JAVIER Oh, really.  General Salazar was there? 
MANOLO No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us. 
JAVIER Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up. 
Seth prepares the drugs by the light of the mini-fridge.

Seth dumps the drugs on the bedside table.  From other pockets he extracts aluminum foil, lighter, tube.  She trails away watching him fix the first hit. 
SETH Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy? 
CAROLINE I think so.  If she didn't she should have. (checks her watch) I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home. 
SETH Why?  Nobody's there. 
He prepares the first hit.  She does it and lies back.  He does one. 
CAROLINE (blowing out the hit) The maid... They ask her what time I get back.  She spies for them. 
Seth starts kissing her.  They try to get into it, but both of them are thinking about the drugs. 
CAROLINE I wish we could stay here.  Just be here forever and ever.  Make it a little home. 
She leans over to snort a tiny line of heroin. 
SETH I want to have sex and do a hit right as we're coming.

SUPERTITLE: EL PASO, TEXAS 
Robert and Sheridan listen to the official tour of the EPIC center delivered by the SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE, 40, a sincere weight-lifter with a sincere crew-cut. 
SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE ...Over 200 DEA field agents, a budget of almost 100 million dollars and state of the art communications equipment make the El Paso Information Center the Drug Enforcement Administration's flagship for the 21st century. 
INT. EPIC BUNKER CAFETERIA - DAY 
A huge lunchroom.  Long plastic institutional tables and agents minding their own business, 
Robert, Sheridan, and their Epic Guide walk through.  They pass a wall of black and white head shots -- 
ROBERT Who are these guys? 
SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE Agents who died in the field. 
EXT. BINOCULAR POV - DAY 
of large mansion with manicured grounds.  The back lawn is filled with children, balloons, a merry-go-round, and pony rides.  It's a sumptuous children's birthday party. 
SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE That house, that you see from the DEA headquarters, belonged to Porfirio Madrigal -- the Lord of the Skies, largest trafficker in Mexico. 
ANGLE ON ROBERT 
looking through the binoculars. 
ROBERT He died in a liposuction surgery, right? 
SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows? (beat) Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha. 
BINOCULAR POV: a child running in circles holding a clutch of colored balloons. 
ROBERT Who do we interface with on their side? 
SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE What do you mean? 
ROBERT I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side? 
SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person. (thinks) See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized.

The men on the plane just stare at him.  Finally the REP FROM DEA leans forward. 
REP FROM DEA Unlimited funds? 
ROBERT Unlimited. 
REP FROM DEA From a DEA standpoint we need a vetted task force and matching funds.  And cut the red tape on getting them equipment and training. 
Robert turns to the others. 
ROBERT Come on.  I want to hear from everyone: FBI.  Customs.  Treatment. Is there anyone from treatment on this plane? (no one answers) Then I want an answer for why there isn't anyone from treatment. (beat) Look, we know we have to bust one of these cartels, Juarez or Tijuana, not just as a symbol, but hell yes, also as a symbol - they are symbols - and there's nothing wrong with sending a message.  That's why when Carlos Ayala hired Michael Adler lead defense, I flew Ben Williams to San Diego to prosecute.  Because he's the best we have, he's our symbol that we're serious about putting the top people away. (beat) So, as of right now, this flight only, consider the dam on new ideas thrown open. 
Still, no one else says anything.  They watch Robert impassively.

BARBARA Does this mean you're going to be gone more? 
A long silence. 
ROBERT Possibly. 
Another silence. 
BARBARA You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter. 
ROBERT Barbara -- 
BARBARA Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert. 
ROBERT The first thing we have to do is present a unified front. 
BARBARA If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole. 
ROBERT Look, I'm as worried as you are -- 
BARBARA No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar. 
ROBERT Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too. 
She looks at him, stung. 
BARBARA I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.

There is nothing, then from the other side of the door, the faint sound of a lighter CLICKING.  AGAIN and AGAIN, then a COUGH. 
INT. CAROLINE WAKEFIELD'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Caroline sits on the toilet.  Glamour Magazine on her lap. 
She's wild-eyed and paranoid.  The exhaust fan is running. 
The aluminum foil is on the sink.  The last little bit of heroin in a wax-paper bundle sits beside it. 
She's listening hard for any SOUND in the house.  What she's wondering is if someone is outside the door listening. 
She puts a piece of crack on the foil and listens hard once more before lighting it.  She does the hit. 
And seems to feel better. 
Suddenly there's a POUNDING on the door.  The VOICE of her father muffled through the solid wood. 
ROBERT (V.O.) (muffled by the door) Caroline.  Open this door immediately. 
Caroline is up like a shot.  She looks around.  The POUNDING on the door gets stronger. 
She crumples the foil and drops it in the toilet. 
The bathroom door SOUNDS like it's about to cave inward. 
CAROLINE (faking the best she can) Who is it?  I'm going to the bathroom. 
She's coping now, full parallel process mode: she dumps the last heroin on the back of her hand and snorts it, checking her nose in the mirror as she reaches for a can of air freshener which she sprays into the air. 
CAROLINE One minute. 
She takes the remaining crack, lighters, tubes, little smudgy druggy bits of paraphernalia and carefully places it all in a hiding place above the bathroom cabinet. 
She pauses a beat, then opens the door, and tries to brush by her father while avoiding his eyes. 
CAROLINE Excuse me -- 
JAVIER Ten years ago Tijuana had no drug problem.  Now it is epidemic. (beat) Ten years ago America takes a hammer to Pablo Escobar, a hammer to the Miami drug trade, and you allowed everything to move to my country. You dumped the problem at our feet. Now, drug use is epidemic.  Now, the treatment centers are full and get no state money.  They survive on donations and what they get for building doghouses to sell to the U.S. (beat) We need lights for the parks so kids can play at night.  So they can play baseball.  So it's safe.  Everybody likes parks.  Everybody likes baseball. (beat) What I'm talking about is I would like to see somebody take an interest in Tijuana.  That's what I'm talking about.

The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.

Caroline, wearing a thick, woolly sweater, and the other PATIENTS sit around on beat-up couches and chairs in a loose circle.  It's a mixed BUNCH: trucker meth-head, rocker dope- fiend, yuppie crack-head, fat, thin, rich, middle-class, and all white.  Caroline is the youngest. 
MARTY, 40's, an overweight alcoholic, finishes his "share." 
MARTY So it was my birthday an my ex-wife was getting remarried and I was in some church basement telling a bunch of strangers how it was a good day because I didn't have to eat out of a dumpster.  That was enough to send me out on big one. (beat) I've been thinking a lot about the first step: that I came to believe I was powerless over alcohol and that my life had become unmanageable. (beat) See my disease tells me I don't have a disease.  That I'm fine.  That it's my birthday and I can have one little drink, then one little line, then one little Valium, then two more fat lines, then two more 10 mil Valium... Six months later I wake up in a sober living house in Philly. And I'm from Dallas, people. (beat) It's a disease -- an allergy of the body and an obsession of the mind. I know that now.  So my name's Marty and today I'm a grateful recovering alcoholic who didn't eat out of a dumpster.  Thanks. 
And Marty looks to Caroline who didn't relate to one word he said. 
CAROLINE (slowly, very nervous) Hi.  I'm Caroline.  I'm not sure I'm an alcoholic. (beat) I mean I don't really like to drink. For someone my age it's so much easier to get drugs than beer.  I don't know, this is really weird and I'm really nervous... 
People in the room nod encouragingly.

HELENA I don't have three months. 
ART APPRAISER It takes time to find the proper collection.

HELENA You must be joking.  That's a fraction of their value. 
ART APPRAISER I'm sorry, but that is the figure I can get today. 
Helena turns her back.  She walks to a window and looks out, then surveys the contents of her beautiful home. 
HELENA (snapping) Get out.  Get out of my house.

INT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY 
SHEILA, 38, a mousy secretary, is on the stand.  Carlos sits at the defendant's table listening raptly.  Gordon and Castro sit in the back watching Helena who pays close attention to the witness -- 
SHEILA I was the company secretary from 1991 to 1994.  I supposedly worked for all six companies.  But... they weren't... I mean, it was just one empty office with a desk and a telephone.  We never sold anything the whole time I was there.  Sometimes people came and got paid.  I don't really know what we did. 
PROSECUTOR Did Mr. Ayala say where the money came from? 
SHEILA No, and I didn't ask. 
PROSECUTOR Where do you think it came from? 
Carl's lawyer, Adler, is on his feet -- 
KAUFMAN This speculation -- 
PROSECUTOR I'll rephrase.  Did you feel like you were engaged in a legal enterprise?

INT. SKETCH'S BEDROOM - DAY 
A single candle lights the room.  Caroline is underneath Sketch the drug dealer.  He is pounding away.  As she clutches his back and holds on, her expression is both surprised and druggy, and SOUNDS escape her mouth that she wouldn't believe she could make. 
There's a KNOCK on the door.  Sketch continues his business. The KNOCKING is more insistent.  Finally, he stops and gets up and goes to the door.  Caroline lies back.  She's in a bed with black sheets in a room with nothing else in it but a dresser and some duffle bags. 
Sketch opens the door -- 
SKETCH What the fuck do you want? 
SOMEBODY outside says something.  Sketch walks over to a duffle bag and extracts some product.  Caroline's eyes are glued to it as Sketch hands it through the door.  Sketch sees her staring at the drugs. 
He comes back to bed. 
SKETCH You want some of that? 
Caroline nods. 
SKETCH What you gonna do to get some of that? 
CAROLINE Please -- 
SKETCH What you gonna do? 
She turns her back to him, pouting.  He laughs. 
SKETCH Maybe a taste. 
He reaches over beside the bed where there is a small tray. 
On the tray is a rig, spoon, several powders, and an eye dropper.  He pulls the candle over and rapidly fixes a speedball.  He pulls the fluid into the neck of the syringe and holds it up the light.  It has Caroline transfixed. 
SKETCH Feed this to you like a little bird. 
He squirts the tiniest amount of fluid into the air.  It arcs in the candlelight. 
CAROLINE Don't -- 
SKETCH You want this? 
She nods. 
SKETCH This is the Express train.  Baby turnin' pro and getting down in a big, big hole. 
Her concentration is entirely, hypnotically focused on the syringe. 
Sketch moves the syringe toward her lips. 
SKETCH Kiss it.  Kiss your new mommy hello. 
Caroline moves her mouth toward the side of the syringe, her lips part. 
Sketch pulls the sheet back, exposing her legs.  He grips one powerful hand around her ankle and squeezes... Veins stand out on her foot. 
He slides the needle into the largest vein and slowly depresses the plunger. 
Caroline watches, then her head tilts back, then forward, she GROANS, sexually and slumps against the pillows, her eyes half-open, her lips twitching. 
Sketch puts the rig back on the tray, then admires Caroline's beauty for a second before starting to fuck her again.

Gordon, Castro and Ruiz, walking with a limp, cross to the building entrance. 
As they push inside, Francisco Flores, in a conservative grey suit passes them going outside. 
The parking lot is empty of people.  The guards at the gate talk about something distracting. 
Francisco passes by the cruiser and drops his keys.  Kneeling down he extracts a small, powerful, magnetized bomb from his jacket.  He attaches it to the underside of the vehicle, stands and walks toward the guard gate. 
INT. COURTROOM - DAY 
The court is filled to capacity.  Helena and Metzger watch from the gallery. 
The JUDGE bangs his gavel.  Adler is on his feet. 
ADLER Your honor, it has come to our attention that your honor, while in private practice, previously represented the town of Seal Beach in their stop-work suit against the Police Department of Seal Beach.  We believe this disqualifies you from hearing this case and we therefore move for a temporary suspension while this is investigated. 
The cruiser EXPLODES. 
Gordon hits the pavement.  Parts of the car begin raining down around him.

INT. SIDEWALK CAFE - SAN DIEGO - DAY 
A fire truck and paramedic unit WHIZZES by.  Manolo sits at an outdoor cafe table, waiting.  He can't help looking around at the attractive people, but he's also nervous. 
Suddenly two MEN, recognizable as Salazar's OFFICERS from the desert drug bust, sitting at a nearby table, rise and move to Manolo's table. 
MAN #1 Manolo, how are you? 
They take seats uncomfortably close to Manolo. 
MAN #2 Manolo, have we interrupted? 
You're looking around like you're expecting someone. 
MANOLO No.  I'm looking for the waiter.  I want to order. 
MAN #1 What are you gonna have? 
MANOLO A steak. 
MAN #1 Well, if you like steak, we know a much better place.  We'll take you there. 
MANOLO That's okay, really. 
They each take Manolo by an arm. 
MAN #2 Manolo, we should really be going now, before it gets too crowded. 
INT. SUV - DAY 
We're looking through the windshield as we approach the Mexican border.  As the car slows, we pan to follow the border official as he looks in briefly and waves us through.  We continue to pan to reveal Manolo in the backseat sitting beside Man #2. 
INT. SUV - DAY 
We're in the desert.  There's nothing in any directions. 
Javi is implacable.  Manolo understands what is happening. 
MANOLO I was going to feed them wrong information.  Feed them lies to... it was for... 
The men say nothing.  After a beat -- 
MANOLO Don't tell Anna I died like this. Tell her it was something else. Tell her it was official business. Tell her that I died doing something honorable.  Please, tell her that for me... 
EXT. DESERT - DAY 
Javi and Manolo stand next to two freshly dug graves. 
MAN #1 Turn around. 
Javi hesitates before turning.  We're on Javi as we hear the GUNSHOT.  Javi doesn't flinch.  Manolo's body falls into the grave. 
Javi stands there, waiting. 
MAN #1 You got anything you want to say? 
Javi shakes his head.  Finally, another GUNSHOT.  After a beat, a hand reaches out of Javi's shoulder. 
MAN #1 Sorry about that... we had to be sure. 
They walk back to the SUV. 
SOMEBODY ELSE Are you sure you don't have anything to tell us? 
Javi says nothing, doesn't even acknowledge them.  We hear a GUNSHOT.

INT. AYALA HOME - DAY 
Arnie Metzger is in Helena's living room.  The stereo is loudly playing MOZART. 
ARNIE That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid. 
HELENA I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try. 
ARNIE Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl. (beat) They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case. 
HELENA That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us. 
Helena steps closer to Arnie, close enough that her breasts are almost touching his chest. 
ARNIE Helena, please.  This is out of your hands. 
HELENA (softly) I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with. 
Helena looks searchingly into his eyes. 
ARNIE Helena -- 
HELENA I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers. 
ARNIE I can't do that. 
Helena leans closer to him. 
HELENA I figured out what Carl was up to and I need your help.  Will you help me? 
CUT TO: 
HELENA This doll is cocaine. 
Juan picks up Spastic Jack and looks at him.  He bangs it on the desk. 
HELENA Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone. 
MARQUEZ I don't believe you. 
She takes out the "solvent" and puts it on his desk. 
HELENA Get a bowl. 
INT. CLUB PLATINUM - OFFICE - LATER 
Spastic Jack is slowly dissolving in a bowl of solvent. Only his shoulders, head, and ridiculous ears remain above the quicksand of milky glop. 
Helena holds a mirror under the desk lamp.  She is drying the paste.  She puts the mirror on the desk.  A white substance has coagulated there. 
HELENA Try it. 
Juan takes out a razor blade and chops the dried substance into two white powder lines.  He hands a silver straw to Helena. 
MARQUEZ You first. 
HELENA I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it. 
MARQUEZ Fine, then we don't have deal. 
HELENA Fine, then we don't have a deal. 
She stands.  He watches her a beat, then smiles. 
MARQUEZ Okay, okay. 
He leans down and quickly snorts a line.  After a beat. 
MARQUEZ That's good coke. 
HELENA It should be... It's yours. (beat) I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed. 
MARQUEZ Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I must first ask you to pass a test. I asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors. 
Helena waits.  Juan Marquez reaches in his desk and pulls out a quarter kilo of cocaine.  He pushes it across the desk. 
MARQUEZ Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal. 
HELENA That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling. 
MARQUEZ Exactly, and this is how I know I'm not getting into business with the U.S. Government. 
She puts the quarter key in her bag and stands. 
HELENA You will help me with my other problem. 
MARQUEZ Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal. 
Tigrillo escorts her out of the room. 
INT. CLUB PLATINUM - DAY 
Helena follows Tigrillo.  As they pass the restrooms she signals that she has to stop. 
INT. CLUB PLATINUM - LADIES' ROOM - DAY 
Helena goes into a stall.  She extracts the cocaine from her handbag. 
She looks at it, trying to figure out where it goes.  She hikes up her skirt.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Javier is hooked up to a polygraph machine watched closely by a POLYGRAPH OPERATOR.  Hughes and Johnson watch as Javi talks into a tape recorder on the table. 
JAVIER ...And I have the electronic serial numbers for their cellular phones. They change them every twenty-four hours but I have a contact at MexTel who can get me the new ESNs within twelve. 
Javi finishes talking and sits back.  Agent Hughes shuts off the tape recorder and looks at the polygraph operator who nods approval.  Hughes and Johnson exchange a look.  They are dumbstruck. 
HUGHES That's good shit. 
JAVIER Now that you have what you want, let's talk about how I get what I want. 
JOHNSON Oh, don't worry, Javier, you're not gonna have any problems there. 
HUGHES I want to take a minute and talk about what type of precautions you're taking to protect yourself.  When Salazar and Madrigal go down, they might send someone to see you. 
JAVIER You worry about getting me the things that I want.  I'll worry about myself. 
There's a beat.  Javier seems discomfited.  The two agents notice this and exchange looks. 
JOHNSON You should feel good about this. 
JAVIER I feel like a traitor.

INT. HEADQUARTERS, I.N.C.D. - MEXICO - DAY 
Robert and Javi walk through the headquarters, a nondescript government building. 
Robert extracts photographs of the bust from a manila envelope.  The crates of cocaine are clearly marked "911." 
ROBERT The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso? 
JAVIER I'm aware of that. 
ROBERT So what's it doing in Tijuana? 
Javi looks Robert Wakefield squarely in the eye.  He shrugs. 
ROBERT Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence? 
JAVIER It could mean that, yes. 
ROBERT That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power? 
JAVIER It's possible. 
ROBERT Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels? 
Javi thinks along time before answering. 
JAVIER Yeah, it's possible... if you're prepared to die.

EXT. AYALA FRONT YARD - AFTERNOON 
An outdoor party is going on.  Children and adults arrive and mingle.  Caterers work the barbecue grill.  Waiters serve food and drink on the rolling lawn. 
Helena circles through the crowd greeting friends.  She looks past her tree line and up the street where a telephone repair van is parked.  She turns back toward her guests.  Somebody has raised a cup and everyone is CHEERING. 
Helena drinks with her guests, then walks inside her house. 
AT THE FRONT GATE 
Montel Gordon walks through the gate and up the drive.  He grabs a drink off the tray of a passing waiter.  He appears drunk. 
Montel follows Helena into the house. 
INT. CARL'S PRIVATE STUDY - AFTERNOON 
Carl hears the CHEERING outside and the sound of LAUGHTER. 
He makes a cellular telephone call. 
INT. ARNIE METZGER'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON 
Arnie is in his office and answers the cell phone -- 
CARLOS (V.O.) It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard. 
ARNIE Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now -- 
Behind Arnie in the office there is a movement of SHADOW. 
INT. CARL'S PRIVATE STUDY - AFTERNOON 
Carl stands at the window looking at his guests while he talks on the phone -- 
CARLOS Don't bother. 
ARNIE (V.O.) What? 
CARLOS So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested? 
ARNIE (V.O.) I was just waiting for the right time. 
CARLOS And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news? 
ARNIE (V.O.) I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else. 
CARLOS You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie. 
ARNIE (V.O.) Carl, that's insane. 
CARLOS So my wife is lying? 
ARNIE (V.O.) Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal. 
On the front lawn CHILDREN are lined up for the ice-cream sundae bar that is being tended by a WAITER. 
CARLOS Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is. 
ARNIE (V.O.) Carl -- 
CARLOS Goodbye Arnie. 
INT. ARNIE METZGER'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON 
Arnie turns around and there are TWO MEN in his office. 
INT. CARL'S PRIVATE STUDY - AFTERNOON 
Carl hears MUFFLED GUNSHOTS over the phone.  He hangs up and turns from the window.  Helena is standing there. 
HELENA Who was that? 
CARLOS Arnie.  He's not going to be able to make the barbecue.

CROUPIER 
A screenplay by 
Paul Mayersberg 
Shooting Script 
FADE IN: 
INT. CASINO - NIGHT 
A roulette table. The PUNTERS place their bets. TWELVE PLAYERS, nine men, three women. The FACES of the men, all ages, intense, hopeful, fearful. Which of them is JACK? 
JACK'S VOICE Now he had become the still centre of that spinning wheel of misfortune. 
A MAN'S hand spins the wheel. The ball is thrown against the spin. Hands, faces, chips... 
JACK'S VOICE The world turned round him... leaving him miraculously untouched The little white ball circles the spinning wheel. 
The PUNTERS'S faces as the ball starts to bounce. All eyes are on the bouncing ball. 
JACK'S VOICE The croupier had reached his goal. He no longer heard the sound of the ball. 
The back of the CROUPIER'S hand, his slicked-back short hair, razor cut. The CAMERA moves around to his face... 
JACK'S VOICE To begin with he was Jack Manfred... 
whistling sound takes Jack back in time. 
INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - DAY 
JACK is walking through a maze of open-plan partitioned offices. He ls casually but fashionably dressed, hair dyed blond long, a nervous elegance about him, almost unrecognisable from the croupier's face. 
He searches for the right office. He finds it. The name on the open is GILES CREMORNE. 
INT. GILES' OFFICE - DAY 
GILES CREMORNE, a public schoolboy in his late twenties comes forward and vigorously shakes JACK'S hand. Jacketless, he wears yellow braces. Next to his tidy desk is a slot machine. 
GILES Take a pew, Jack. You look well. What's it been, two years since we broke bread? 
GILES has an upper-class accent, but an acquired street manner. 
JACK Three years, two months. March 
GILES What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa? 
JACK She went back to South Africa. 
GILES (digging) Did she? (smiles) You were pretty thick at one time. 
JACK We all played the field. 
GILES frowns at a memory, an implication. GILES'S mobile phone buzzes. He picks up. 
GILES Hi-ya... I'll call you back. (to Jack) Now then... 
JACK (suddenly) I want a job, Giles. 
GILES (cautiously) All right. As what? 
JACK I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you? 
GILES We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds? 
JACK opens a pack of Gitanes. 
GILES Sorry. This is a no-smoking office, Jack. You've written a book, haven't you? I didn't read it myself, but -- 
A WOMAN SECRETARY puts her head into the office. 
GILES Give me ten minutes, Fiona. 
JACK reaches for a cigarette. 
JACK All right, I'll think about it. 
I won't. Goodbye, dad. 
JACK SR. Just do it. You've got the knack, you've got the personality, you got that from me. 
JACK lights up. 
JACK SR. You understand the punters. Think about it, you can write during the day and sleep knowing the bills are paid. 
As he speaks, he watches passing WOMEN. 
JACK SR. For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. (exhales) 
JACK (exhales) All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him. 
JACK is not enthusiastic, but he scribbles the name down on a pad. 
JACK So how are you doing, dad? 
JACK SR. Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good. (pause) I love you Jacko, you know that 
JACK Yes, I know that. 
JACK SR. Don't let yourself down. 
JACK I won't.  Goodbye, dad. 
JACK hangs up. 
INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY 
Stubbing out his cigarette, JACK SR. leaves the booth. We now see where he is. A beach bar in South Africa. He walks to the bar and....goes behind it, slipping on his barman's jacket. A WOMAN in dark mirror glasses and a bathing suit is waiting. 
JACK SR. (smiles) Sorry to keep you. What'll you have? 
INT. JACK'S SITTING ROOM - DAY 
JACK, disturbed by the call, pours himself a vodka. He looks at what he's written: 'THE BALL... A NOVEL BY... JACK MANFRED.' 
JACK'S VOICE Jack knew something was wrong. He'd forgotten Giles' advice. Giles said three words. 
JACK inserts a word in the title. It now reads: 'ON THE BALL'. JACK drinks. After a moment... 
JACK'S VOICE JACK'S VOICE No. Jack knew it still wasn't quite right... 
He types: 'IN THE BALLS'. Then, on reflection, deletes 'IN THE'.  Through the iron bars JACK watches feet pass on the street above. A drunk drops a beer can over. The can falls in SLOW MOTION but the clatter is loud. 
DRUNK'S VOICE I want to fuck the whole world over. 
INT. CASINO - DAY 
Reception area. The CAMERA turns around the fake glitz of the interior: brass, drapes, polished wood, mirrors, and moves towards the front door. 
JACK'S VOICE Welcome back Jack... to the house of addiction. 
The door opens. Against a blaze of street daylight, JACK'S silhouette appears. The CAMERA moves forward to greet him. JACK removes his wristwatch. 
INT. CASINO - MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY 
JACK shakes hands with DAVID REYNOLDS, a cold man in his late forties, dead behind the eyes. 
REYNOLDS David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John. 
JACK Jack. 
REYNOLDS examines a file in front of him. 
REYNOLDS You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he? 
JACK (frowns) Has he? 
REYNOLDS Could you stop that for a minute? 
The WOMAN looks up, surprised. JACK watches, then catches sight of REYNOLDS surreptitiously moving a chip onto the third line. 
JACK I'm sorry, sir, I've called no more bets. 
JACK reaches across, takes the chip and puts it on the wood Grounding the wheel. REYNOLDS nods approvingly. The ball stops. 
JACK 23 Red. Odd. 
He now rakes away the losers' chips and pays out the smallest first, before getting to the major pay-out on 23. It's all very efficient and speedy. 
REYNOLDS is increasingly impressed. 
REYNOLDS Haven't you forgotten something? 
JACK (thinks) I don't think so. 
REYNOLDS Wipe your hands. 
JACK takes out a handkerchief. 
REYNOLDS Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched. 
JACK What happens if I want to sneeze? 
REYNOLDS You won't. Not without permission. 
JACK laughs. REYNOLDS smiles. They like each other. 
REYNOLDS Fine. Now let's move on. 
INT. CASINO - DAY 
A blackjack table. JACK is turning cards over for five punters in an arc. REYNOLDS is moving from one chair to the next playing each of the five hands. 
REYNOLDS How many aces are left? 
JACK Five. 
REYNOLDS I make it six. 
JACK Five. 
REYNOLDS looks down at the table. 
REYNOLDS What makes you so sure? 
JACK It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right. 
REYNOLDS Good call. 
JACK pulls out the shoe. 
JACK You want me to check? 
REYNOLDS (irritably) I said good call. 
REYNOLDS walks away. JACK puts the shoe back. He takes his watch out of his pocket, glances at it. 
JACK'S VOICE It had taken him 45 minutes, but Jack now had Mr Reynolds's number. The man couldn't count. 
INT. CASINO - OFFICE - DAY 
Back in the office REYNOLDS is talking to JACK. On REYNOLDS'S desk is a framed photograph of his suburban wife and two kids. 
REYNOLDS Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture. 
JACK What for? 
REYNOLDS For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters. 
JACK I don't gamble. 
The CAMERA reaches a LOW ANGLE on JACK, looking up. 
JACK Yes. What's the salary? 
EXT. CAR - STREETS - TWILIGHT 
The street lamps have come on. JACK is at the wheel of a Sixties Austin-Healey. 
JACK'S VOICE The casino paid its staff monthly in arrears. He would have to wait six weeks for his first cheque. He needed money now. 
EXT. USED CAR LOT - TWILIGHT 
Under a canopy of coloured lights A CAR DEALER is walking round jack's car, examining it. 
DEALER (fake American accent) What kind of deal you looking to? 
JACK What's the Blue Book price? 
DEALER That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition. 
JACK'S VOICE The car was a gift from Jack's father. That's to say, Jack Senior had given it to him before the bailiffs arrived. 
The DEALER picks at the cracked leather seats, the protruding stuffing, the chipped dashboard, the rust. 
DEALER This ain't exactly what you'd call mint. 
He bends down and looks underneath the car. 
JACK How about fifteen hundred? 
DEALER How about five hundred. 
JACK What?! 
DEALER How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty. 
JACK Is that your idea of arithmetic? 
DEALER I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business. 
JACK Eight-fifty. 
DEALER Seven-fifty. 
The DEALER looks at JACK. JACK stares back. It's as if one is waiting for the other to blink first. Neither blinks. 
JACK'S VOICE He suddenly wanted to be rid of it. 'Hang on tightly, let go lightly'. It was a saying Jack remembered. 
JACK leans into the open car and takes out his hat and cigarettes. He has accepted the offer. The music begins... 
INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT 
... And continues. JACK stands, with an unlit cigarette, in a crowded moving train. He looks at the faces, MEN and WOMEN. He sees PEOPLE reading books. He looks at the TITLES: Romantic fiction, Classics, Business Management, Thrillers, Self-Help, Cooking.... 
JACK'S VOICE Jack imagined people reading his book. One day he would enter their heads, play with their imaginations, test their feelings... 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
JACK crosses the road. He turns down a side street where Victorian houses have been converted into flats. There are scores of 'For Sale' and 'To Let' signs down the street. 
JACK'S VOICE He would tell them you have to make a choice in life. Be a gambler or a croupier. And then live with your decision come what may. 
He goes down into a basement, closing the iron gate behind him. 
INT. JACK'S BASEMENT FLAT - NIGHT 
JACK unlocks the door, goes in, to the accompaniment of street sounds and a dog barking. 
JACK'S VOICE Marion saw life differently. She was a romantic. And thought he was too. 
INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT 
Radio music is playing from another room. An orchestral version of 'Try a Little Tenderness'. JACK comes in, hangs his hat up, looks around. He sees a neatly arranged vase of flowers that wasn't there before. He goes to the bedroom. 
MARION Come into my world. 
She winds the black scarf across his face, covering his eyes. 
MARION (whispering) You're my prisoner. 
JACK I've got something to tell you. 
MARION I want to hear it. 
JACK I've got a job. 
MARION (startled) What job? 
MARION pulls the scarf from his eyes. She wants to look at him. 
JACK In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer. 
MARION How did you land that? 
JACK It came my way. 450 a week. 
MARION (sits up) 450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training? 
JACK I had training. In the Republic. 
MARION You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers. 
JACK I start Monday week. 
From the street comes the whining sound of a car alarm. 
MARION 450 a week. I've never earned that in my life. You're an enigma, you are. A fucking enigma. 
JACK'S VOICE Not an enigma, just a contradiction. 
MARION looks deeply into his eyes. 
MARION You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me. 
JACK There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious. 
MARION I love you Jack, you know that. 
JACK'S VOICE And he half-loved Marion. And she knew that too. 
Outside, the car alarm stops. JACK takes MARION'S head in his hands. She reaches for one of them, examines it. 
JACK Are you trying to read my palm? 
MARION You've got such beautiful hands. 
JACK'S VOICE The hands of a conjuror, a woman had told him once. Or a card sharp. 
Their hands interlock. She leads him into the bedroom. 
INT. NAIL STUDIO - DAY 
JACK'S hands are being worked on by a woman MANICURIST. 
MANICURIST What line of work are you in? 
JACK I'm an undertaker. 
MANICURIST Really? 
The MANICURIST stops for a moment, looks at him with curiosity. 
INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY 
A BARBER is cutting JACK'S hair. He goes up JACK'S neck with electric clippers. Jack's hair is now black. 
BARBER Do you work round here? 
A WHITE-HAIRED MAN on JACK's right speaks to him: 
MAN You're new here. You'll get used to Madame Claude. She comes in once or twice a week and does that. 
JACK nods. 
JACK'S VOICE He knew the scam. Come in with five grand cash. No questions asked. Launder it by getting a casino cheque when you cash in. Jack wondered why Mr Reynolds permitted it? After all there's was no profit in it for the casino. Or was there? 
INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT 
Later. A different set of PUNTERS. The wheel spins. A GREEK MAN sits at the table. He doesn't attempt to bet. He looks around to see a CROUPIER in his late 20's waiting to replace JACK at the wheel. This is MATT. He gives JACK a curious complicitous smile. JACK collects the chips and pays out. 
JACK Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. I'm going to hand you over now to my colleague. Goodnight. 
MATT takes over. 
MATT Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. 
REYNOLDS appears and takes JACK'S arm. 
REYNOLDS (quietly) Good work, Jack. You handled yourself well. 
At the table, MATT glances at the GREEK man. 
INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT 
JACK is now dealing to FIVE PUNTERS. He has a 10 and a 5 exposed for the house. TWO PLAYERS go bust. ONE PLAYER sticks on 19, the next on 20. The LAST PLAYER buys a card for 21. JACK turns over an ace for the house. He twists again. It's a 5 - making 21. The two losing PLAYERS groan. The LAST PLAYER is paid evens for equalling the house. One of the PLAYERS who's gone bust gets up, having lost all his chips, and leaves. 
JACK'S VOICE Suddenly a delayed wave of elation came over him. 
INT. CASINO - NIGHT 
Across the casino an Oriental man, MR TCHAI, is walking towards the table with REYNOLDS. Behind him is a 6 foot 5 bulging BODYGUARD. REYNOLDS comes up to JACK's table. 
REYNOLDS Why don't you take a break, Jack. 
JACK (puzzled) All right, Mr Reynolds. 
He moves his chair back, nods at the remaining PLAYERS. MR TCHAI sits down, watched by the BODYGUARD. 
BELLA comes up, smiles sweetly, and takes over from JACK. 
BELLA Good evening, Mr Tchai. 
MR TCHAI Good evening. 
TCHAI pulls out a sealed bank packet of £5,000. 
REYNOLDS Enjoy yourself, Mr Tchai. 
REYNOLDS waves to a WAITRESS who comes over. 
WAITRESS (to Mr Tchai) Your usual, sir? 
TCHAI nods. He hands her a £50 note. 
WAITRESS Thank you, sir. Enjoy your game. 
JACK'S VOICE £50 for a diet Coke. Waitresses were the true winners in the casino. They were the only members of staff allowed to accept tips. On a good night they could get between £200 and £300. 
The WAITRESS goes. The other PLAYERS at the table look at MR TCHAI, wondering who he is. 
INT. CASINO - NIGHT 
REYNOLDS walks with JACK across the casino. 
REYNOLDS Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella. 
JACK Does he win? 
REYNOLDS (smiles) He's a good customer. 
JACK'S VOICE A good customer is a consistent loser. Was that what Mr Reynolds meant? 
JANI (smiling) You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink. 
JACK It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters. 
JANI That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me? 
JACK Impossible to calculate. 
JACK'S VOICE Jack knew that, in reality, all odds are calculable. 
INT. RITZ HOTEL - NIGHT 
The Art Deco bar. Expensive PEOPLE around. JANI and JACK are installed on a sofa. A WAITER puts down two Martinis. 
JANI (raises her glass) To coincidence. 
JACK (drinks) There's a casino in this hotel. 
JANI I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar. 
JACK So why did you come to my casino? 
JANI I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership. 
JACK First visit to London? 
JANI No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally 
JACK I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast. 
JANI Near the casino. 
JACK In the casino. 
JANI Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there. 
JACK Your father? 
JANI I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother. 
JACK The debts. 
JANI And the lies. Gamblers are born liars. 
JACK (nods) And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft. 
JANI That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there? 
JACK We all came from Africa, supposedly. 
JANI Do you believe in astrology? 
JACK Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology. 
JANI laughs out loud. 
JANI You know, you don't strike me as a typical croupier. 
JANI drinks. JACK notices her wedding ring. JANI catches the look. 
JANI I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off. (looks at her watch) I must go. Let me pay for this. 
JACK Absolutely not. 
JANI Toss you for it. 
JACK I don't gamble. 
JANI nods, stands up, takes out a notepad and pen. She looks round feigning conspiracy. 
JANI (low voice) I know this is verboten, but if you feel like a chat or maybe dinner, give me a call. 
She scribbles her name and phone number on the pad, tears off the page, gives it to him. 
He straightens his hat and walks off. BELLA walks the other way. 
EXT. STREET. NIGHT 
A MAN lurks in the shadows ahead of JACK. JACK doesn't see him. But as he comes past, the MAN steps out blocking JACK'S way. He is the Arabic-looking MAN JACK earlier caught cheating at the casino with JANI. 
MAN You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm. 
JACK Wait a minute. You got yourself barred. 
MAN It was you, you shit. 
The MAN reaches forward and grabs JACK'S tie. He yanks it with farce. JACK gasps. He rams his elbow into the MAN'S chest. 
The MAN kicks JACK on the shins. JACK topples. The MAN leaps at him. JACK, knees him in the groin. 
The fight is untidy and vicious. Both men collapse struggling onto the pavement. 
A car appears, a Mini-Cooper. BELLA is driving. She sees the fight. 
JACK'S nose is bleeding. The MAN kicks him in the back. JACK yells with pain, gets to his feet. 
JACK Now I'm going to kill you. 
He boots the MAN in the head. BELLA gets out of her car and runs over to them. 
BELLA Jack! 
The MAN is screening under JACK'S repeated blows. BELLA pulls JACK away. 
BELLA Jack. Leave him! Come on! 
JACK'S face is masked with blood and fury. BELLA is frightened by JACK'S violence. 
BELLA Let's go. We don't want the cops here. 
Before she can get JACK into her car, he goes back to the MAN groaning on the floor. He stamps on the MAN's hand. BELLA is shocked. 
JACK (coldly) He won't cheat again. 
BELLA pulls him away, bundles JACK into her car, gets in, drives away. 
INT. BELLA'S FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Water is running in the basin. BELLA puts JACK'S jacket on the lavatory seat. She starts to undo his tie. JACK wipes his blood-stained nose with a wet flannel. 
BELLA You're shaking. 
JACK It's the tension. 
She undoes his shirt and takes it off. He winces. She washes his torso, cleans him up. 
JACK looks at his shaking hands. BELLA takes him by the hand, leads him into the bedroom. 
INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
She sits him on the bed. The room is lit with coloured lamps. 
BELLA Excuse the mess. 
JACK pulls her suddenly into his arms, pulls her onto the bed. She is startled. 
BELLA Careful. 
JACK'S hands open her blouse. He reaches for her breast. BELLA'S surprise becomes excitement. He kisses her hungrily, his hands rummaging in her clothes. She reaches for a side zip in her skirt. 
BELLA Don't tear anything. 
BELLA kicks off her shoes. There is a burst of passion between them. For JACK, a continuation of the violence with the MAN on the street. 
For BELLA, it's a sudden release. Her naked foot knocks over the bedside lamp. 
JACK spreads BELLA on the bed. She tugs his trousers down. He rips her black underwear away. 
JACK'S VOICE At last he had found what he'd been looking for. A clear and simple theme. And a hero to act it out. Little Matt... (Pause) ...Chapter One. 
INT. CASINO - WASHROOM - NIGHT 
MATT is shaving. 
MATT I look like shit. 
JACK is scrubbing his nails at a basin. 
JACK Rough day? 
MATT Rough life, Jack. 
A YOUNG WOMAN appears in the mirror behind the two MEN. Her name is PAT. She is dressed like BELLA. 
PAT Hi. I'm Pat. 
MATT and JACK say 'Hello'. MATT appraises PAT'S appearance, winks approval at JACK. 
JACK (to Matt) What happened to Bella? 
MATT I'll tell you later. 
JACK is mystified. 
INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT 
JACK is dealing to MR TCHAI and three OTHER MEN. One chair at the table is empty. 
MR TCHAI What happened to Bella? 
JACK She was re-assigned. 
JACK shows 13. He turns over his third card, a King. The bank busts. JACK pays out. 
JANI sits down in the vacant chair. JACK conceals his surprise, a hint of nervousness. 
JACK (formally) Good evening. 
JANI nods impassively. 
JACK'S VOICE Jack knew this was no coincidence. Why had she come? 
The MEN look at the glamorous woman. MR TCHAI doesn't register her presence. He is as inscrutable as his BODYGUARD who hands him an envelope. JANI takes out money from her purse. JACK counts it. 
JANI One thousand even. In fifties. 
JACK slots the money down, counts out 20 £50 chips. JACK deals. Bets are placed. 100 from JANI. The cards turn. MR TCHAI splits two aces. JANI has a 6 and 7. MR TCHAI receives two los and wins big. JANI gets a 10 and busts. 
JACK'S VOICE He wondered if she believed he would bring her luck... 
JANI'S face is impassive. She receives her cards... 
INT. CASINO - NIGHT 
JANI busts again. JACK sweeps away the chips, the cards. JANI reaches into her bag, takes out another thousand pounds. 
JANI In fifties. 
The MEN at the table look at JANI. 
JACK'S VOICE Or did she think he would help her win? 
INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT 
JANI loses again. She is down to 4 chips. She looks up at JACK. Their eyes meet, hers desperate, his helpless. MR TCHAI picks up on the look. 
JACK'S VOICE He knew how to fix it for her. His father had taught him the trick. Switch the sequence. Bust the bank. The casino wouldn't spot it. But Jack was wary of the punters... 
JACK glances at the MEN at the table. 
JACK'S VOICE He could see Mr Tchai was counting. He couldn't risk it. 
JACK It's the truth. 
MARION Without hope there's no point to anything. 
JACK Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative. 
MARION Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it. 
JACK sees MARION is getting really angry. He crosses the room, Pointedly takes MARION'S handbag, opens it, takes out a National Lottery card and receipt. The doorbell rings. 
JACK (coldly) You're just like all those other dummies out there. Fourteen and a half million to one! Is that your idea of hope? 
The doorbell rings again. 
MARION The door, Jack. 
JACK Leave it. 
MARION No. Answer it! 
JACK hands her the lottery card and goes to the door, opens it.  BELLA stands there. 
BELLA You fucking little shit! You shopped me. 
JACK What are you talking about? 
MARION watches, numb. 
BELLA Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew. 
JACK I don't know anything about it. 
BELLA looks over to MARION. 
BELLA Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now. (to Jack) You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are. 
JACK (firmly) Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt. 
BELLA You're all scumbags. 
MARION I agree. 
Without looking at MARION, BELLA suddenly kisses JACK on the lips. BELLA looks hard at JACK, then leaves. JACK pursues her. 
EXT. BASEMENT - NIGHT 
BELLA runs up the iron stairs to the gate at the top. 
JACK Bella! 
Without looking back she flings the gate shut, goes off down the street. JACK turns. 
MARION Go on. Go after her! 
MARION slams the door to the flat. JACK is half-way up the stairs, alone. 
EXT. PICCADILLY DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING 
The rush hour. 6 in the evening. JACK watches MEN and WOMEN coming out the store. 
JACK'S VOICE Jack had no idea where Marion was staying, or with whom. He realised he knew little about her life. But then, he had never asked about it. 
JACK now sees MARION. He is about to go up to her, moving through the flow of the crowd, then he stops. 
A MAN in his 30s, tall with a moustache, greets MARION. He's been waiting for her. JACK watches the two of them, unseen. 
The MAN and MARION exchange a few words. She smiles, takes his arm. He leans forward to kiss her. 
JACK'S VOICE For the first time in a long while Jack thought about his mother. She'd left when she couldn't take it any more.  His father had said 'Don't worry, Jacko, she'll come back.' She didn't. 
JACK turns and walks away. 
JACK'S VOICE But Marion wasn't his mother... 
JANI, wearing dark glasses, is driving. JACK, beside her, reads a map with a torch. 
JACK I don't know how you can drive at night with those glasses. 
She turns and smiles at him. Her left hand is bandaged. 
JACK How did you hurt your hand? 
JANI Just an accident. Nothing. 
JACK Turn left ahead. 
The car turns into a lane. 
JACK Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room. 
JANI That's fine. 
EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT 
The Honda's tyres crackle on the gravel drive which leads to a floodlit yellow stone country house. There are three cars parked outside the entrance. The Honda stops next to them. 
INT. HONDA - NIGHT 
JACK prepares to get out. JANI catches his arm. She takes off her dark glasses. Her right eye is bruised. 
JANI There's no point pretending it was an accident. I had a fight with someone, that's all. 
In the distance there is the sound of a tennis ball being struck. 
EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - TENNIS COURT - NIGHT 
A floodlit tennis court. A racquet smacks a tennis ball. JACK sits with GILES drinking Bloody Marys watching a game of mixed doubles. 
Everybody's wearing sweaters. JANI is playing with one of GILES'S friends, GORDON. On the other side, two girls, FIONA from Giles' office, and CHLOE, Gordon's girlfriend. 
JACK follows JANI'S game. She is far and away the best of the four. 
GILES is also studying JANI's movements, her knickers when she serves. 
GILES She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend. 
JACK South African women are very sporty. 
JACK watches JANI'S strong leg muscles as she moves about the court. 
GILES I can see. How did she get that shiner? 
JACK has been waiting for this. 
JACK I found her in bed with someone. 
GILES (surprised) Who was he? 
JACK She. 
GIEES I say. You're a dark horse, Jack. 
On court, Jani delivers a winning overhead smash. The four PLAYERS shake hands across the net. They come off the court. GORDON puts his arm around JANI. His girlfriend CHLOE notices. JACK is irritated. GILES catches the moment. 
GORDON (to Jack) You don't play tennis? 
JACK I don't play anything. 
GORDON How boring for you. 
JANI moves deliberately away from GORDON, who clearly fancies her, and sits down beside JACK. She pointedly kisses him on the cheek. GILES glances at GORDON, who shrugs. FIONA comes up to GILES. 
FIONA Where's our drinks? 
CHLOE They're so bloody selfish. 
JANI (to Jack) I'm so glad you brought me. 
Before each player calls we hear Jack's voice. In the end he correctly predicts their call. Is it telepathy? Or something else? 
GORDON I'll stick. 
FIONA Two cards. 
GILES One card. 
CHLOE Oh I don't know...Er...two cards. 
JANI Three cards. 
The PLAYERS examine their hands. The WOMEN are pleased. The MEN say nothing. JANI puts her cards together. 
The betting begins. No one drops out. The raising goes round three times. 
FIONA That's it. I haven't got any more cash. 
The betting comes to an end. JACK watches as they turn their hands over. GORDON turns over a Straight. 
GORDON Beat that. 
CHLOE turns over a Flush. 
CHLOE Ha. Ha. Ha. 
GORDON Shit. 
FIONA turns over a Full House. 
FIONA Not so fast, darling. 
GORDON (disbelieving) Hang on, chaps. That's impossible! 
GILES turns over four of a kind. 
GILES How's about that for impossible. 
Laughter, cries of amazement. 
GORDON What's going on? 
JACK is impassive. They all look to JANI, who turns over, one card at a time, a Straight Flush. 
CHLOE Wow. What are the odds for this happening? 
More laughter, cries of amazement. 
FIONA Thousands to one. 
JACK 42,300,000 to 1. 
JANI Approximately. 
GORDON I could've won if I'd been able to bluff. 
JANI leans forward and takes the pot. GILES looks at JACK, then at JANI. 
GILES I get it. 
JACK Get what? (smiles) Are you accusing me of cheating? 
GILES Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't need to work. 
INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
JACK sits on the side of a four-poster bed and takes off his shoes. On the other side of the bed JANI unzips her skirt. She looks round the room. 
JACK'S VOICE Here was an interesting question. Was writing work... or play? 
JANI puts her skirt over a chair and goes into the bathroom. She doesn't close the door. JACK continues undressing. From a hold-all he removes a pair of pajamas. He glances at the open bathroom door, then climbs into his pajamas. He has two ugly bruises on his chest from the fight with the ARABIC MAN. 
JANI comes out of the bathroom naked. She sees his body. 
JACK You're serious. 
JANI You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all. 
JACK comes right up close to JANI in bed. 
JACK And I thought you were only after my body. 
JANI I've come to know you. You're honest. (takes his hand) I trust you. 
JACK What'll you do when it all goes wrong? 
JANI It won't. 
JACK But if it does. 
JANI You keep the ten thousand pounds. 
JACK What ten thousand pounds? 
JANI gets out of bed. 
JANI These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you. 
JACK Reynolds? You've done your research. 
She puts her hand on his. 
JANI I didn't know what else to do. You're my last chance. 
She takes his hand and puts it on her bruised eye. 
JANI Next time it'll be my neck. 
JACK What about my neck? 
JANI is close to breaking down. Her toughness evaporates. 
JANI I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean. 
JACK I can't do it, Jani. 
JANI I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend. 
JANI goes back to bed. She turns out the light. JACK stands in the middle of the dark room. 
INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - PASSAGE - STAIRS - NIGHT 
JACK comes out of the bedroom in his pajamas, wearing his hat. He walks slowly down the passage. He hears the sounds of love-making coming from one of the rooms. He passes 'The Raft of the Medusa' as he goes down the stairs. 
INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
JACK comes into the kitchen, switches on the light. He goes to the refrigerator, takes out a bottle of vodka. He washes a dirty glass and pours himself a drink. 
JACK'S VOICE Jack wondered why he was even considering it. Ten grand. In cash. That was why. But Jack didn't need the money. His father would have taken it, like a shot. But his father was a gambler. 
He downs his drink, and leaves the kitchen. 
INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - PASSAGE - NIGHT 
JACK walks back to his room. There is silence now, no sounds of sex. 
JACK'S VOICE He was always broke. Jake suddenly realised... it was Jake who was considering it. 
INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
JACK comes in, tosses his hat on the bed. JANI isn't in the bed. The bathroom door is afar. He hears the sounds of gasping. He rushes to the bathroom. 
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
JANI is holding her head over the lavatory bowl. JACK runs some water in the basin. He helps her to her feet and gives her a glass of water. 
She washes out her mouth. She looks at him, tears running down her face. 
He starts to get undressed. MARION stirs. JACK puts the book charm around his neck. She moves from the middle to one side of the bed, making room for him. He holds the charm. 
JACK It's beautiful. Thank you. 
MARION I hope it brings you luck. 
JACK It will. 
MARION I haven't brought you much luck, have I? Perhaps we shouldn't be together. 
JACK That girl, she works at the casino -- 
MARION -- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I? 
JACK You're entitled to your opinion. 
MARION It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong. 
JACK takes her in his arms. 
JACK I'll leave the casino soon. (he strokes her hair) I promise. 
MARION You will? 
JACK Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit! 
They begin to make love. She holds the back of his head. 
MARION Then you can dye your hair blond again. 
INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT 
JACK is asleep in bed with MARION. He is murmuring indistinguishable words. It wakes her. She gently touches his shoulder. He opens his eyes. 
JACK What? 
MARION You were talking in your sleep. 
JACK Not talking. Writing. 
INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY 
JACK is at work alone. The phone rings. He leaves it and continues I working. Then he hears JANI'S VOICE. 
JANI'S VOICE I need to see you. I've moved. I have a new number. It's 468-3275. Please call me. 
There is a click. JACK scribbles the number down and resumes work. 
INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT 
JACK gets off a train. He is dressed as a croupier. He walks to a public telephone on the platform, taking JANI'S note from his pocket. He dials the number. The noise of the train and PASSENGERS makes it difficult to hear. The phone at the end rings and rings. JACK waits. 
JACK I want to speak to Jani de Villiers... (waits) Jani... it's Jack... I'll come over now... 
He takes out a notepad and writes down the address. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
JACK walks down a street of rough, transient's hotels. The street lamps are on. 
JACK'S VOICE Chapter Seven... Jack had decided to see her. The challenge was essential. 
He comes up to a hotel called 'Journey's End'. He goes in. 
INT. HOTEL. STAIRS - NIGHT 
JACK climbs the creaking stairs under the fluorescent lights. He knocks on a door. JANI opens it. She wears men's pajamas. She looks unslept. 
JANI Come in. 
She glances up and down the passage. JACK goes in. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
SUIT Whatever. 
JACK gives him ten pale blue chips and puts another pale blue chip into the rack alongside the rainbow of colours used by the other punters. The SUIT looks at his watch. 
INT. CASINO - NIGHT 
Two men in raincoats, DETECTIVES, approach REYNOLDS and talk to him. REYNOLDS becomes nervous, looks around the casino. The table at the bar where the SUITS sat is empty. The PRIVATE green baize door slowly closes. 
INT. CASINO - NIGHT 
The ball bounces into number 5. There are cheers of delight from the winners, 5 is heavily covered. 
The SUIT casually slides a pale blue chip onto the number at the side. 
JACK Sees the obvious cheat. So do other PUNTERS. 
JACK (stiffens) Sir, I can't accept that bet. 
The SUIT gets up and comes around the table to JACK. 
SUIT Are you calling me a cheat? 
PUNTER You are a cheat. I saw you. 
SUIT (grabbing Jack's lapel) I'm talking to you. 
JACK pushes him away. The SUIT hits JACK'S face with his fist. Uproar around the table. JACK hits the man. The SUIT grabs JACK and pushes him backwards across the table, knocking all the chips over. The PUNTERS start shouting. They grab their chips, especially the losers. One PUNTER tries to restrain the SUIT. JACK kicks the SUIT hard. They fight, trading blows. 
At the blackjack table MR TCHAI and the other CHINESE see the fight. MR TCHAI barks at the BODYGUARD in Chinese. The BODYGUARD heads for the fight at the roulette table. 
TWO DEALERS rush over to stop the fight. Somewhere in the distance there is the sound of a gunshot. PEOPLE start screaming. The SUIT punches JACK in the stomach. JACK doubles up. The SUIT breaks away, rushes across the casino, pushing screaming WOMEN aside, heads for the door. MR TCHAI's BODYGUARD blocks his way and fells the SUIT with a hammer blow to the head. 
The TWO DETECTIVES come up. One of them handcuffs the SUIT, who is lying on the floor. The casino is in uproar. A strange, violent Christmas party. 
INT. CASINO - NIGHT 
JACK lies groaning on the floor. MR TCHAI is standing, watching JACK. REYNOLDS'S VOICE comes over the tannoy system: 
REYNOLDS Ladies and gentlemen, please be calm. There's no cause for alarm. Enjoy yourselves. It's Christmas. 
REYNOLDS'S VOICE is replaced by a breezy version of 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'. JACK struggles to his feet, amid the chaos. He falls back in pain. MR TCHAI and the other CHINESE leave the casino with the BODYGUARD. 
INT. HOSPITAL - CASUALTY - NIGHT 
JACK is sitting in a Christmas-decorated cubicle, a curtain drawn round. An INDIAN NURSE is bandaging his arm. He has two large plasters on his chest. 
The NURSE finishes the job, smiles. 
NURSE There you go. 
She hands him two pills and a glass of water. In the background there are party sounds. The NURSE leaves. JACK fingers the charm around his neck. 
There is a pause. Then the curtain is pulled back. MARION enters. She carries a bottle of wine and two cartons of Chinese take-away. JACK is surprised. 
JACK How did you know I was here? 
MARION I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here. 
She starts to pour wine. JACK is still puzzled. 
JACK Did you go to the casino? 
MARION hands him a glass of wine. 
MARION Happy Christmas. 
They touch glasses and drink. 
MARION Now...noodles or rice? 
As she opens the cartons, JACK watches her, still uneasy. 
MARION (quietly) I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend. 
POLICEMAN Mr Manfred? 
JACK Yes... 
The sound of the roulette ball bouncing against the numbers. 
INT. MORGUE - NIGHT 
A POLICE DOCTOR uncovers a body on a gurney. The sound of the ball find-ing a number. JACK can hardly bear to look. It is MARION. With emotion... 
JACK'S VOICE What were the odds of being killed by a car... on New Year's Eve? 
MAN'S VOICE She was on her way home... to you. 
JACK No. She wasn't. 
JACK looks away from MARION'S face. He sees the MAN with the moustache, standing on the other side of the gurney, the MAN he saw with MARION on the street. He is DETECTIVE INSPECTOR ROSS. JACK is disorientated. 
JACK'S VOICE Marion had been visiting his mother...no, no, not his mother - her mother. 
JACK (to Ross) She was visiting her mother. Her mother. (suddenly) Who are you? 
ROSS Detective Inspector Ross. 
JACK Who... 
ROSS Ross. 
JACK Who did it? Tell me! 
He grabs ROSS'S lapels. ROSS carefully removes JACK'S hands. 
ROSS We think it's a hit-and-run. A drunk driver, probably, But there is a possibility of a revenge killing. 
JACK'S VOICE (distraught) Revenge? For what? Whose revenge? 
ROSS As you know, she was a WPC with the Met. up until two years ago. 
JACK fumbles in his pocket for a cigarette. There is a No Smoking sign on the wall. ROSS produces a Zippo and lights JACK'S Gitane. 
ROSS She called me last week. She'd got wind of a planned robbery at your casino. 
JACK'S VOICE What had that got to do with her death? 
ROSS You didn't recognise the man who attacked you, did you? 
JACK (loudly) Of course I recognised him! 
ROSS (surprised) You did? 
JACK I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat. 
ROSS sighs, looks at MARION. 
JACK suddenly reaches down and pulls the white sheet back over MARION'S face. 
JACK (to Ross) Do you gamble? 
ROSS is puzzled. JACK drops his cigarette on the floor, grinds it with his shoe. ROSS gives JACK his card. 
ROSS If anything occurs to you, call me. 
JACK walks away from ROSS without a word. The DOCTOR is now filling out a form. 
From the door JACK looks back. ROSS waits for him to say something. JACK doesn't speak. 
ROSS I was in love with her, you know. 
There is a REPRISE of JACK covering MARION'S face with the sheet. 
EXT. STREETS - NIGHT 
In his croupier's suit JACK walks the night streets. 
LUCY You don't trust women drivers, do you? 
JACK'S VOICE Jack didn't trust anyone. Except himself. 
INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAWN 
JACK sits at his computer. He is watching the printer unloading page after page. JACK assembles the typescript. 
JACK'S VOICE It was finally finished. He thought of sending it to Giles. But that wouldn't be right. He would select a publisher at random, like a number. 
CLOSE UP: The dedication: 'To Marion'. 
The sound of the ball bouncing against the wheel. 
INT. CASINO - NIGHT 
The ball falls into 10. JACK puts the doll on 10. 
No one at the table has the winning number. JACK sweeps away the losing bets. 
INT. CASINO - NIGHT 
A Blackjack table. The bets are placed. JACK turns over the bank's cards: a KING and an ACE. He takes all the chips from the five PUNTERS. 
PUNTER (to Jack) You're wasting yourself. With your luck you ought to come over to our side. 
EXT. STREET. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT 
JACK comes up to a bookstore window. A sticker reads: 'IT'S A WINNER'. There are quotes blown up from the reviews: "AN INCREDIBLE INSIDE JOB...IT'S ALL HERE, THE SYSTEMS, THE SCAMS, THE SLEAZE...A TALE OF TRIUMPHANT DISGUST...OF EXHILARATING CONTEMPT..." The display is just one book: 'I, CROUPIER'. Number 1 Bestseller. 
JACK'S VOICE Even his publisher had no idea who the author was. He had done the deal through a lawyer. It gave him a good feeling, no one knowing... 
INT. REYNOLDS'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
REYNOLDS is reading the book. He laughs out loud at something. 
JACK'S VOICE ...It never occurred to anyone at the Casino that the Golden Lion had been his model. Why should it? Weren't all casinos the same.... 
INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT 
JACK is sitting in his croupier's suit on the crowded tube. He sees a WOMAN reading 'I, CROUPIER'. For the first time we see the back cover...'by ANONYMOUS'. 
JACK'S VOICE ...It gave him an exquisite pleasure, being an underground man. With all his money, he hadn't even bought a car. Jack knew the truth about himself, he was a one- book writer. A one time winner who had quit while he was ahead... 
INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAWN 
Five in the morning. 
JACK'S VOICE He changed nothing in the flat, bought nothing, spent nothing. The only thing he did was to remove the bars outside the window... 
JACK comes in. The phone rings. 
INT. SUN CITY. CASINO - NIGHT 
JANI is holding a mobile phone. In the background is the casino room, the lights, colours, rattling sounds. She waits. 
INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT 
JACK hesitates, then picks up. 
JACK Hello... 
JANI Jack! It's Jani. 
The following conversation is INTERCUT. 
JACK Jani! Where are you? 
JANI Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months. 
JACK (smiles) How are you? 
JANI Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.

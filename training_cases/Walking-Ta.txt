Chris raises his hands and the sheriff chuckles. 
SHERIFF WATKINS Did I scare ya with that one? 
CHRIS Lil bit. 
SHERIFF WATKINS Ya. Let's go. 
INT. POLICE CAR 
SHERIFF WATKINS You were gone a while huh? 
CHRIS 8 years. Harstad was sheriff back then. 
SHERIFF WATKINS Harstad, yeah. Sad story. About 5 months back he fell asleep at the wheel and uhhh... hit a tree. Good man, good man and a good sheriff. 
EXT. THE FAMILY HOME 
CHRIS Thanks for the ride. 
SHERIFF WATKINS No problem, and uh Chris (hands him a piece of paper). It's election month... I'm your man. 
Chris takes the paper and smiles. He walks up the lane toward the house, a simple white building clad in wood. A lady dressed in a police uniform comes out. 
MICHELLE Can I help you? 
Chris laughs. 
MICHELLE Lil' brother.. You come over here and gimme a hug. 
They laugh together. 
CONNIE I wish you would have told me you were coming I would've cooked. 
CHRIS This is great. 
MICHELLE So what are you gonna do now that you're home? 
CHRIS Well I was planning on working at the mill, your letters never mentioned that it was closed. 
CONNIE We didn't wanna bother you with our problems when your father got laid off. 
DAD I got my business, you saw the furniture outside. 
CONNIE I substitute at the elementary school, Michelle pitches in. We try to keep things simple. 
A kid walks in. 
MICHELLE Pete! This is your Uncle Chris. 
CHRIS Hey Pete. 
MICHELLE Sit down, say hello. Last time he saw you you were barely walking. 
PETE And now I'm camping. 
MICHELLE I said you could sleep on the couch. It was Chris' room first. 
CHRIS Your tent's gonna take on water. I could show ya how to rig it. 
PETE Doesn't look like it's gonna rain to me Colonel. 
MICHELLE Pete, cmon sit down, have somethin to eat. 
Pete looks at him. 
CHRIS Ok, I'll crash on the floor, you crash on the bed. 
PETE uh uh. (starts walking out) 
CHRIS Pete. (hands him a towel). Keep ya dry. 
PETE Did you really kill people? 
Chris looks at him. 
EXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE 
A crappy camper van rolls up. A man steps out. 
CHRIS Ray Ray! Ahaaa. 
RAY Hello puddin'. 
They hug. 
CHRIS How ya doin? 
RAY I'm alright. 
CHRIS What is that? (points to the van) 
RAY That's the lovemachine. 
CHRIS Girls actually get in there? 
JIMMY His parents hadn't left him the mill more than 2 minutes before he shut it down. 
CHRIS Why? 
a voice shouts 'HEADS UP' Chris catches a fast ball thrown from behind. Jay steps out of his vehicle. 
JAY Cause I opened my Casino. 
CHRIS Still got a gut huh Jay? 
JAY Still got your reflexes. What, you get tired of being all that you can be? 
CHRIS I'm still all I can be. 
JAY Really? I'll just have to see about that. What brings you home? 
CHRIS I just wanna relax, catch my breath. 
JAY You? Relax? 
Another truck with a few guys on it pulls up 
JAY Not today. 
A football game ensues, there are two teams. Jay's guys vs Chris' guys. On the sidelines Pete pulls up on a small motorcycle. Chris notices Pete hanging around with kids smoking. It comes down to the last play, the teams are huddled into two groups talking. 
RAY If we score here we win right? 
CHRIS Alright boys, last play. We need to put this to rest. 
RAY Just give me the ball. 
CHRIS Don't you have to be native american to own a casino? 
JIMMY Oh Hamilton's one sixteenth black man now. 
FRIEND 2 Just so you guys know, I'm gonna triple my money tonight. 
FRIEND 3 Yea, like last time. Wound up selling your body for bus fare. 
FRIEND 4 He had to walk! 
They all laugh. 
CHRIS Nobody's gonna have any problems finding this place. 
RAY It's the subtle attention to aesthetics that I find most impressive, blends in with the mountains SO nicely. 
INT. WILD CHERRY CASINO 
The place is packed with gambling tables and attractive women. 
FRIEND Not bad huh? 
CHRIS Not bad. 
RAY Isn't it wonderful? All your gambling needs under one great big roof. You got your ATM machine, tellers to cash your paycheck, and when you're here you don't gotta worry about those lil things like child support, rent, the laws of mathematical probability. 
WORKER Gentlemen, Mr Hamilton would like to invite you to the VIP lounge. 
RAY Oh, 'Mister' Hamilton. 
INT. VIP LOUNGE 
Chris puts a load of money on the table. 
CHRIS Bet you I'll roll a seven. 
CROUPIER It's not your roll sir. SIR! It's not your roll. Call security. 
Chris has taken the dice. 
CHRIS Put your bets down on the pass line. These dice are comin up seven. 
JIMMY Chris, why don't we just let it go? 
CHRIS No, we gonna let it ride Jimmy. The dice are comin up seven. 
CROUPIER It's not your roll sir. 
Chris rolls the dice and sure enough it's a seven. 
COMMISSIONER No folks, no payout. 
CHRIS (To croupier) Why don't you just take care of that bet and we're even. 
CROUPIER Well I would but it wasn't a legitimate bet, you're not the shooter. It's not your (Chris shoves him) ROLL sir. 
SECURITY GUY Is there a problem? 
CHRIS Yea, the problem is your dice are loaded. Does your boss know about this? Just gimme my money. 
The security guy grabs Chris around the neck. Chris elbows him and throws him onto the table. The croupier takes a fighting stance. Jimmy taps Chris on the shoulder. 
JIMMY Come on, let's go! let's go! 
MICHELLE Oh come on you need to be out arresting whoever tried to kill my brother not testing his BLOOD. 
SHERIFF WATKINS I'm just doing my job Michelle. Ok? I understand how you feel. But we still don't know yet who started all of this. 
CONNIE Well it wasn't Chris. 
DAD Just find out who did this to him Stan. 
SHERIFF WATKINS I'll do my best Mr Vaughn. I really will. In the meantime I have to file a full report. You lemme know when I can talk to him. 
The doctor nods. 
SHERIFF WATKINS Thank you. 
DOCHRIS He's gonna be fine Michelle. 
MICHELLE Thanks. 
INT. HOSPITAL WARD 
Ray goes into a room and takes a big bunch of flowers from there. 
NURSE BEAUTIFUL flowers! 
RAY Thank you, they're for my best friend. 
INT. CHRIS HOSPITAL BED 
RAY Hey sarge, so much for our VIP... status. Don't they teach you any fighting skills in the army. 
CHRIS How did you do? 
DAD Let's go. 
INT. CAR 
DAD Ya whole life, all you wanted to do was get outta here. What made you come back. 
CHRIS You gonna think I'm crazy. I been thinking about the mill. When I was a kid goin to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar. You remember that smell. 
DAD Mmm I remember a lotta nice things before the mill closed. 
CHRIS When did they go outta business? (Nods to a closed supply store). 
DAD Closed about six months ago. There's a home depot about fifteen minutes up the road. 
CHRIS And that? (Nods to an adult XXX shop) 
DAD Don't ask. 
They laugh. 
EXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE 
Jay pulls up in his car. 
JAY Hey. First of all I wanna say thanks. 
CHRIS For what? 
JAY He's been fired, and his gaming permit's been pulled. I don't know how my security cameras didn't catch that. 
Jay starts to help Chris taking wood off the truck but Chris throws it back on. 
SHERIFF WATKINS Well hey Chris. Good to see you up and about, you're lookin spiffy. 
CHRIS I'm here to press charges. 
SHERIFF WATKINS Well this isn't about that incident at the casino a while back is it? 
CHRIS Yea, it is. 
SHERIFF WATKINS Cause that matter's closed. 
CHRIS Did you look into it? 
SHERIFF WATKINS They did an internal investigation. That's good enough for me. 
CHRIS An internal investigation. 
SHERIFF WATKINS Chris, I know you're familiar with the term 'no fly zone'. Hmm? Cause that's what the casino is. Since the mill closed down that casino is the main source of revenue in this town. So, case closed basically. I'll see ya. 
CHRIS I'm not gonna let this stand. 
SHERIFF WATKINS Excuse me? What did you say to me? 
CHRIS I said I'm not gonna let this stand. 
SHERIFF WATKINS You're lucky to be alive right now, that's all you need to be concentrating on. This is my town ok, I'm the sheriff here. I'll tell you what will stand, not the other way around. Now please get out of my building. 
INT. FAMILY HOUSE 
Deni is at the door. 
DENI Hey. 
DENI I have my moments. 
CHRIS So the casino huh? 
DENI Yep. Been there almost a year. 
CHRIS Treatin you good? 
DENI Lot better than it treated you. 
CHRIS I like that. Jay Hamilton's done well for himself hasn't he. 
DENI Yea, he's a real go-getter that one. 
CHRIS Must be. I heard he got you. 
DENI Lasted about 8 minutes, a long long time ago. 
CHRIS You still work for him though. 
DENI Rent's gotta be paid Chris. 
CHRIS Suppose so. 
DENI Hope to see you around. 
CHRIS Do you? 
She begins to drive off. 
CHRIS Thanks for the jacket. 
Chris speeds off. He pulls up at their home and enters the garage. 
DAD Is Pete ok? 
CHRIS He'll be fine. 
Chris is searching about and forces open a cupboard. 
DAD What are you doin? 
Chris pulls out a shotgun and loads it. 
DAD Aw Chris not like this. Chris listen to me. If you go outta here with that gun, they're gonna.. ne... Chris! 
Chris drives to the casino, he cocks the shotgun but decides to leave it in the truck. Instead he takes a piece of wood from the back of his truck. He enters the casino with it. He smashes a fruit machine. A guard comes up and Chris beats him. A fight scene breaks out with Chris beating the guards and generally trashing the place. He takes back his special forces dogtag from the guard who stole it. Chris hurls his piece of wood at the VIP lounge window, smashing it to pieces. Jay emerges from behind it. 
JAY Guess that changes our relationship a bit huh? 
Chris leaves. As he drives off in his truck, police cars appear with sirens going. He pulls over. 
SHERIFF WATKINS You should NOT have come looking for trouble. Keep your hands up, get out of the vehicle now Chris! NOW! 
INT. POLICE STATION ROOM 
LAWYER I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought. If you go to trial you stand to do 18 years. This is a sweet plea, normally they wouldn't even put it on the table but your military record can't be ignored. Three months home arrest, some community service. Pretty generous offer Chris. 
CHRIS But I'd have to plead guilty. 
LAWYER Look at it from the other side. There's over a dozen witnesses, none of em are gonna paint a very flattering picture. 
We see a montage of casino workers badmouthing Chris. 
CASINO GUARD 2 I think he had a point to prove yeah. 
WORKER I was emptyin machines when Mr Vaugh came in and started swingin. 
GIRL I was tryin to get outta there. 
JUDGE Mr Crow, you may present your client's case. 
CHRIS (To his lawyer) You're fired. 
CHRIS Your honor, I'd like to plead my own case. 
JUDGE Order, order. Mr Vaughn, if you choose to represent yourself and not be represented by legal counsel you realise that you can't then claim a mistrial on that basis. 
CHRIS Yes I do. 
JUDGE Very well Mr Vaughn. 
CHRIS I don't deny anything that was said here today. 
JUDGE Does that mean you're changing your plea to guilty? 
CHRIS I'm not guilty of anything. Except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't. 
OPPOSITION Objection. He's trying to introduce prior events your honor. 
JUDGE Sustained. Mr Vaughn stay on point. 
CHRIS I grew up in this town. People used to walk tall in this town, they wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino. 
JUDGE Mr Vaughn we're not here to listen to civic speeches. 
CHRIS Watkins. 
WATKINS Well you won the election, congratulations. We do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here, and I can personally vouch for each and every one of these men. They're good deputies. 
CHRIS You're all fired. 
INT. POLICE STATION 
Chris takes a look around. 
EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD 
Jay is speeding along in a sportscar. He is pulled over by a police truck. 
JAY Hey Chris. 
CHRIS License and registration please. 
JAY You're joking right? 
CHRIS License and registration. 
Jay hands it over. 
JAY What's the problem sheriff? 
CHRIS You. And the drugs you're pedalling out of your casino. 
JAY Oh. Only thing that's going on in my casino right now is reconstruction. You took care of that. 
CHRIS Yea that's right and I plan on taking care of everything else too. 
RAY Oh now you're a CROOKED cop doing favours for friends. That's how it starts. See next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks, frisking dudes crotches. 
CHRIS Are you done? Ray I need your help. 
RAY Oh don't do that. 
CHRIS I need you to take me to drugs school. 
RAY I get to wear a uniform? 
A montage ensues, with Chris and Ray busting various drug dealers. 
EXT. DEALER'S HOUSE 
CHRIS You're SURE you're not carrying anything. 
BOOTH I don't have shit. 
CHRIS Officer. 
RAY Yeah. 
CHRIS Search him.

BOOTH Now you read me my rights and take me in. And I call my lawyer. 
RAY K. I have a hunch there may be somethin else in here (Pats the dealer's truck). 
CHRIS Could be. 
CHRIS Can I talk to you? 
RAY Yeah. 
CHRIS Over here? 
RAY Sure. 
CHRIS I'm gonna stay with him tonight. I need you to take care of my parent's place. 
RAY You think they're gonna take it that far? 
Chris hands him the shotgun. 
RAY I'm with you man, I'll check in later. 
CHRIS Kay. 
NIGHT TIME 
Deni comes into the police station. 
DENI Don't shoot. 
CHRIS Hey 
DENI Hi. How's the food around here? Brought you special treats. Salmon, Fried Chicken, Potato Salad. You got cups? 
CHRIS Don't you have to work tonight? 
DENI Hmm I quit. I figured you know, you were making some changes around here, I could make a few myself.

Chris and Ray hold up their hands. He aims at Ray but he's shot in the back of the head by Dad who is approaching down the stairs. 
CHRIS You gonna be ok? 
Dad nods. 
EXT. THE MILL 
Chris is in a police car driving at speed. He approaches the mill and busts through the locked gates. 
INT. THE MILL 
The mill is dark, Chris is finding his way around using a torch. He finds Jay sitting. 
JAY Hey Chris. 
CHRIS Get up Jay. 
JAY Just a sec. Remember we used to play hide n seek up here? 
Jay hits a metal saw which resonates making a metallic sound. 
JAY That was my favourite sound. 
CHRIS Get up! 
Jay stands up and holds up his hands.

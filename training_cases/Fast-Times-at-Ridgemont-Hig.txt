Fast Times at Ridgemont High 
FADE IN: 
EXT. RIDGEMONT CENTER MALL - NIGHT 
From the outside parking lot it looks like an enormous beached whale. It is the prime hangout for all the teenagers in the area. Kids mill around the parking lot or stand by the mall entrance. 
INT. RIDGEMONT CENTER MALL 
There are three levels of stores underneath a massive fluorescent roof. Different music comes from each store. It looks seventies-modern, but already used and run-down. Groups of kids cruise the mall, eyeing each other and acting cool. 
INT. SWENSON'S ICE-CREAM PARLOR - NIGHT 
The teenage waitresses in their peppermint pattie uniforms are rushing around, trying to keep up with their orders. 
A good-looking man in his mid-twenties enters and sits. He wears a plastic name tag that says: "Pacific Stereo Audio Consultant, RON JOHNSON." 
Two Swenson's Waitresses pass by with supreme indifference, and take their orders into the back kitchen. 
INT. SWENSON'S BACK KITCHEN 
WAITRESS #1 I think he looks like Richard Gere. 
The two Waitresses discuss the issue at hand. One of them, Linda Barrett, is the seventeen year old, retired sex queen of Ridgemont High. 
WAITRESS #1 (CONT'D) I think he looks like... Richard Gere. (Bruce Springsteen) 
LINDA Did you see his cute little butt? 
A third waitress enters. 
WAITRESS #2 Let's talk about C-19. 
WAITRESS #1 AND LINDA We were! 
WAITRESS #2 I think I'll drop over and change the shakers. 
LINDA No, be cool, that's Stacy's section. 
Through the entrance, we see Stacy Hamilton. She is the fifteen-year-old trainee, sweet-looking with just the last traces of baby fat. She puts down a glass of water for Ron, spills some and mops it up. 
WAITRESS #1 He's too old for Stacy, she hasn't even started high school yet. 
A flustered Stacy enters the back kitchen. 
LINDA How's it going. 
STACY Do you think that guy's cute? 
WAITRESS #1 In a blow-dryed kind of way. 
STACY Does anyone else want to take his table? 
LINDA Don't you like him? 
STACY Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really. 
LINDA Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man. 
STACY What should I do? 
LINDA Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot. 
She fluffs up Stacy's hair and gently shoves her towards the door. Stacy reluctantly exits. 
INT. SWENSON'S DINING ROOM 
Stacy goes to Ron's table. 
RON So you working hard or hardly working? 
Stacy thinks it over, decides it's a joke and laughs (a little too late). Ron looks at her soulfully. 
RON (CONT'D) You look like you could still be in high school. 
STACY I know, everyone says that. 
He stares at her and she stares back uncomfortably. 
STACY (CONT'D) What can I get for you tonight. 
RON How about your phone number? 
Stacy smiles nervously. 
INT. RIDGEMONT MALL - OUTSIDE SWENSON'S - NIGHT 
grumbling, putting shirts back on. It pains them. 
Dennis heads back to his office when he sees something in the trash bin. 
DENNIS Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton? 
BRAD They were left over from the last shift. 
DENNIS Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton. (glares at Brad) Perfectly good. 
BRAD But they weren't mine. 
Brad laughs, goes back to work. 
INT. MALL - LATE NIGHT 
It is closed and only a few janitors remain. Stacy and Linda walk through the large empty mall. 
STACY He gave me his card. (lovingly) 'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.' 
LINDA (amused) Should we buy a frame for that? 
STACY Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week? 
LINDA Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call. 
STACY So what did you do? 
LINDA I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him. 
STACY I can't do that. 
They pass a janitor cleaning graffiti that says: LINCOLN SURF NAZIS and MAGGOT LUST FOR THE DUST. 
LINDA Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies. 
STACY Really? 
LINDA Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will. 
STACY (cute) He was hot, wasn't he? 
LINDA If I didn't have a fiance in Chicago, I'd go for it. 
A young Girl runs and catches up with Linda and Stacy. 
GIRL (breathless) Are you Linda Barrett? 
LINDA Yes. 
GIRL I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something. 
Linda nods. 
GIRL (CONT'D) I have this situation with my boyfriend, and I wanted to... (looks at Stacy, then whispers in Linda's ear) 
Linda listens thoughtfully, then clicks into her "sex expert" mode. 
LINDA Okay, are you over sixteen? 
The Girl nods. 
LINDA (CONT'D) All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly - several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's. 
GIRL And they don't call my parents? 
LINDA Not if you're over sixteen. 
GIRL Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda. 
LINDA And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either. 
The Girl thanks Linda again. Linda and Stacy get to the back exit of the mall and Linda uses a key to open the door. 
STACY I can't believe I start high school tomorrow. 
LINDA Believe it. 
They exit the mall, into the night. 
EXT. RIDGEMONT SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
We see all the elements of the first day of school. The students carry new books, explore new lockers, begin to stake out their ground. 
Someone has taken the steel letters from the green vanguard out front. It reads: "IDG MON SENOR HI HO." 
The rest of Ridgemont High is covered with toilet paper. And a black spray paint message along the side of the front office building reads, "LINCOLN SURF NAZIS." 
RICH (as soon as she is gone) Your sister is really turning into a fox. 
BRAD You should see her in the morning. 
BRAD'S BUDDIES Hey-yooooooooooo. 
INT. U.S. HISTORY CLASS - DAY 
Stacy barely slips in the door before the final attendance bell sounds. She finds a seat just as the teacher's cubicle door opens at the back of the classroom. A tall figure comes barreling down the aisle. He is Mr. Hand. The man makes a double-speed step to the door at the front of the class, kicks the door shut and locks it. The windows rattle in their frames. Stacy watches, wide-eyed, at her first high school class. 
MR. HAND Aloha. My name is Mr. Hand. 
Mr. Hand writes his name on the green chalkboard before his class. Every letter is a small explosion of chalk. 
MR. HAND (CONT'D) (almost sweetly) I have but one question for you on our first morning 'together.' (pause) Can you attend my class? Pakalo?... Understand?... History has proven us one basic fact. Man does not do anything that is not for his own good. It is for your own good that you attend my class. And if you can't make it... I can make you. 
An impatient knock begins at the front door of the classroom. 
MR. HAND (CONT'D) We have a twenty-question quiz every Friday. It will cover all the material we've dealt with during the week. There will be no make-up exams. It's important that you all have your Land of Truth and Liberty textbooks by Wednesday. At the latest. 
The knock continues. 
MR. HAND (CONT'D) Your grade is the average of all your quizzes, plus the midterm and final, which counts for one-third. Got it? 
The mystery knocker tries a lazy calypso beat on the front door. No one in Mr. Hand's U.S. History class dares mention it, much less answer it. 
Stacy grips her desk with the tension of her first day. 
MR. HAND (CONT'D) Also. There will be no eating in this class. You get used to doing your own business on your own time. That's one demand I make. I don't like staying after class with you on detention. That's my time. I don't like wasting it. Just like you wouldn't want me to come to your house some evening and discuss U.S. History on your time. Pakalo? 
Hand finally turns, as if he has just noticed the sound at the door and opens the door an inch. Jeffrey Spicoli stands in the doorway, red eyes glistening. His long, blond hair is still wet and streaming down the back of his white peasant shirt. He grins, oblivious to such trivial matters as attendance bells. A Student sitting near Stacy turns to his friends. 
STUDENT That guy has been stoned since the third grade. 
MR. HAND Yes? 
SPICOLI Yeah. I'm registered for this class. 
MR. HAND What class? 
SPICOLI This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window. 
MR. HAND (appears enthralled) Really? 
Spicoli holds his red ad card up to the crack in the door. 
SPICOLI Can I come in? 
MR. HAND (swinging door open) Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here. 
Spicoli laughs. He is the only one. 
SPICOLI Sorry I'm late. This new schedule is totally confusing. 
Mr. Hand takes the red ad card and reads from it with utter fascination. 
MR. HAND Mr. Spicoli? 
SPICOLI That's the name they gave me. 
Mr. Hand slowly tears the card into little pieces and sprinkles the pieces over his wastebasket. Spicoli watches in disbelief. His hands are frozen in the process of removing his backpack. 
SPICOLI (CONT'D) You just ripped my card in two! 
MR. HAND Yes. 
SPICOLI Hey, bud. What's your problem? 
Mr. Hand moves to within inches of Spicoli's face. 
MR. HAND No problem at all. I think you know where the front office is. 
It takes a moment for the words to work their way out of Jeff Spicoli's mouth. 
SPICOLI You... dick. 
In the tense moment that follows, no one in the class is sure what might happen. 
Mr. Hand simply turns away from Jeff Spicoli as if he ceased to exist and coolly continues his lecture. 
MR. HAND I've taken the time to print up a complete schedule of class quizzes, and the chapters they cover. Please pass them back to the desks behind you... 
Hand begins passing out stacks of purple mimeographed sheets. 
ANGLE ON STUDENTS 
all smelling the purple mimeographed sheets. 
RON I think I better take you home. 
STACY What about those other guys you live with? 
RON No. I mean back to your home. 
But they make no moves in any direction. They continue making out. Ron begins unbuttoning her blouse and massaging Stacy's breasts. A moment later, he tugs at her pants. Awkwardly, she starts to help him. He tilts her backward onto the concrete dugout bench. They kiss feverishly, her hand pulling off her shoes, then her pants. Ron goes to work. 
RON (CONT'D) (whispers) Is this your first time? 
STACY Yes. 
STACY'S POINT OF VIEW 
as she feels a man enter her for the first time, we see the graffiti above her: Surf Nazis Lincoln was here --  Sieg Heil Led Zeppelin Dan y Roberto (Disco Fags) 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. SCHOOL LOCKERS - DAY 
Stacy is standing by her locker, twirling the combination. She is joined by Linda Barrett. 
LINDA Was it great? 
STACY It was okay. 
I LINDA You'll always remember your first time. 
STACY It was nice. 
LINDA So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious? 
STACY Come on, Linda. It's just sex. 
LINDA Hey! That's my line! 
They both laugh and walk down the hall. 
EXT. HAMILTON HOME - LATE AFTERNOON 
Stacy arrives home. The Hamilton home has that anonymous prepackaged tract look, like many others in this lower-middle class neighborhood. 
Brad washes his car in the driveway and listens to the car radio. 
BRAD Mom says to clean up the pool. 
STACY Why can't you do it? 
BRAD Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up. 
STACY Your friends use the pool too. 
BRAD I take out the garbage. 
STACY Don't strain yourself. 
Stacy bristles, and heads inside the front door. 
INT. HAMILTON LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 
The furniture in the Hamilton living room looks like it was gleaned for a sale at Pic 'N Save. Through the living room, one can see a very small, kidney-shaped pool. 
Stacy checks an erasable telephone message sheet near the refrigerator. There are two names on it: BRAD/STACY. Brad's side is filled with messages. Stacy's is empty. 
She notices a summer bouquet floral arrangement. Stacy reads the attached note. It reads: "Memories of You, Ron Johnson." She quickly gathers it up and carries it back outside. She fans the door several times to dispel the odor. 
EXT. HAMILTON DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON 
STACY Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this? 
BRAD They're not home yet. 
STACY Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work? 
BRAD I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson? 
STACY I'll explain everything later. 
Brad nods, as Stacy pushes the flowers into his arms. 
INT. DAMONE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON 
Damone expertly fills two glasses three-quarters full of Kahlua, then adds a few drops of milk. Music is playing on a nearby speaker. Damone hands The Rat a drink and checks himself out in his mirror. 
DAMONE See that moustache coming in, Rat? 
There is only a hint of peach fuzz, but he grooms it anyway. 
BRAD Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years! 
LISA I don't want to talk about it here, Brad. 
Brad prepares to respond. He squints his eyes, prepares for a truly sizzling comeback, when Dennis Taylor, short and prematurely balding assistant manager of Carl's Jr., comes bustling out of his back office. He quickly surveys the situation in the kitchen. 
TAYLOR Hamilton! You have fifteen double cheese to box! 
Lisa returns to her cashier post, leaving Brad's last words stalled in his mouth. 
EXT. HAMILTON HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT 
We see the Hamilton's cul-de-sac home. All the lights are off in the house at this hour. Except for Brad's room. 
INT. BRAD'S ROOM 
Brad is alone in his room. He's prone on his neatly made bed, reading a paperback book entitled Power With Class. On the wall of Brad's room is a large framed photo of a Carl's Jr. hamburger. 
Brad hears a muffled knock at his door. 
BRAD Come on in. 
Stacy walks into Brad's room. 
STACY Thanks for getting rid of those flowers. 
BRAD Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers? 
STACY It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him. 
BRAD I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own. 
He begins pacing. 
STACY Is everything okay at work? 
BRAD Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent. 
STACY You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you? 
BRAD I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom. 
STACY Why? Because she won't sleep with you? 
BRAD Where did you hear that? 
STACY I'm just guessing. 
BRAD Well... it's true. 
STACY Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa. 
BRAD Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend. 
Suddenly, Stacy pops the question. 
STACY Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin? 
BRAD Why? 
STACY I don't know. I was just curious. 
BRAD Maybe yes. Maybe no. 
STACY You are a virgin! 
BRAD I didn't say that. 
STACY But your face did! 
They laugh. Then Brad turns serious. 
BRAD Are you still a virgin? 
STACY Maybe yes. Maybe no. 
BRAD Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin! 
Stacy smiles and stands up. She playfully slaps her brother on the arm and walks down the hallway to her room. We can see there is less frill and lace in Stacy's room. The junior high paperbacks are gone. There are no dolls in sight. 
EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Linda and Stacy walk past rows of cars. Stacy stops at a brown MG. 
STACY There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen. 
LINDA Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again. 
INT. SWENSON'S - AFTERNOON 
Stacy and Linda are enjoying a brief lull in the Christmas season madness. They sit at the sundae bar. Stacy looks forlorn, almost red-eyed, as she makes a sundae. 
LINDA You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy. 
STACY I think Christmas brings out the worst in people. 
LINDA I guess Ron hasn't called yet. 
STACY Not since November. 
Linda nods her head, always the coach. 
LINDA Stacy, it doesn't look good for the relationship. 
Stacy continues making her ice cream, slapping the scoops onto the stainless steel dish. 
STACY (sighs) Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen? 
LINDA Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on. 
ANGLE ON GREGG AND CINDY 
who are seated at a back table, feeding each other. 
Stacy looks at her finished sundae. 
STACY I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out. 
LINDA Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday. 
STACY Thanks a lot. 
Linda punches Stacy lightly on the shoulder. 
LINDA Hey -- Ron Johnson? It's his loss. 
We follow Stacy, as she walks into the dining room to serve the sundae. 
INT. WHEREHOUSE RECORDS - MALL - DAY 
We see a group of buzz-cut young toughs, walking in formation, hunched over, sneering and wearing sleeveless U.S. Army fatigue jackets. None of these damaged-looking kids is over the age of fourteen. They pass to reveal this legend on their backs: LINCOLN SURF NAZIS. 
Angle on Mike Damone and Mark Ratner, who are standing by the upcoming concert list posted on the door to Wherehouse Records. Damone sees the Surf Nazis pass, turns to Mark Ratner, who is still wearing his Cinema Four jacket. 
DAMONE The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith. 
THE RAT I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now. 
DAMONE There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall. 
Damone is approached by a couple of young ticket Customers. 
CUSTOMER #1 Got any Blue Oyster Cult tickets? 
DAMONE No Cult. I ate twenty-four pairs of Blue Oyster Cult tickets last time around. I was this close to working at 7-11. No Cult. 
Suddenly we see all ticket business stop. Damone and his customers see someone menacingly coming directly for them. The small crowd parts as Charles Jefferson, football duffel bag in hand, walks up. With him is a thick, tough, miniature version of himself. This is Little Charles. They both stop in front of Damone. 
JEFFERSON (after long look) When is Earth, Wind and Fire coming? 
DAMONE (respectfully) I'm really not sure. I haven't heard anything yet, but I'll let you know the second there is the slightest news, sir. 
JEFFERSON I'm taking my little brother. 
DAMONE Excellent. So that will be two tickets... All right. Fine, sir. 
Jefferson and L.C. push past the customers. 
CUSTOMER #2 Wow. He really lives here. I thought he just flew in for the football games. 
DAMONE (gaining composure) Shit, he's my man. He knows where to come for tickets. 
Damone turns to The Rat. 
DAMONE (CONT'D) Well, Rat. Are you ready for the moment of truth? 
The Rat adjusts his jacket, and nods. 
THE RAT She is immune to my charms. 
They walk together towards Swenson's, as The Rat drapes his aqua-blue Cinema Four jacket around his shoulders, like a French film director. Damone walks a few steps, then stops Rat. 
DAMONE Hey, Rat. 
THE RAT Yeah? 
Brad watches him disappear behind the door that says: ASSISTANT MANAGER. 
As soon as Dennis disappears behind the door, the one Businessman in the place rises and returns to the counter. 
BRAD (CONT'D) (nervously) May I help you? 
The Businessman has short, curly brown hair. He speaks in a whine. 
BUSINESSMAN Yes. This is not the best breakfast I ever ate. 
The Businessman points to the huge display over Brad's head: TRY OUR 100% GUARANTEED BREAKFAST. 
BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) And I want my money back. 
Brad begins searching under the counter. 
BRAD Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here. 
BUSINESSMAN No. I want my money back right now. 
BRAD Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too... 
BUSINESSMAN See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back. 
Brad begins looking to the restroom. "Where's Arnold?" 
BRAD I can't do that. But if you wait a minute... 
BUSINESSMAN (as if talking to a kindergartner) Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay? (looks at name tag) Please, Brad? 
BRAD I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here. 
BUSINESSMAN I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to... 
Brad looks up from under the counter. No amount of pay will make him take that kind of insult. 
BRAD Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass. 
BUSINESSMAN Manager!! 
"Bam!" The door to the Assistant Manager's office swings open, and Dennis comes hurtling out of the back. 
DENNIS Can I help you, sir? Is there a problem? 
BUSINESSMAN You bet there's a problem! Your employee used profanity and threatened me with violence! I'm shocked, frankly. I've eaten here many times and I've always enjoyed the service -- until today! 
Angle on bathroom door as it opens and Arnold starts towards the register. He quickly sees the incident with the irate Businessman and ducks back inside the bathroom. 
BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) All I wanted was my money back for this breakfast. It was a little undercooked. And this young man threatened me. Now I plan to write a letter! I plan to... 
Dennis wheels around to Brad. 
DENNIS Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way? 
BRAD He insulted me first. He called me a moron. 
DENNIS Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way? 
BRAD Yes, sir. 
DENNIS You're fired. 
Brad looks around, expecting his friends to defend him. Dave and Rich seem very occupied with their work. Brad is stunned. 
DENNIS (CONT'D) (to Businessman) I'm very sorry this happened to you, sir. 
BUSINESSMAN Thank you very much. 
Then Brad unhooks his fryer's apron and throws it on the counter. He grabs a backpack and walks out of the place. On the way, he bangs the bathroom door with his fist. 
BRAD I hope you had a hell of a piss, Arnold. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. BRAD'S ROOM - DAY 
He arrives back in his room and locks the door. He yanks the burger picture off his wall, dumps it into the trash. Then he takes it back out of the trash and cracks the cardboard picture and plastic frame in half. 
DARKNESS 
We are in the middle of a deep, dark void. After a moment, a pinprick of light appears in the distance. We head towards the light. We are being led somewhere important. 
As we draw still closer, curtains suddenly part to reveal a wildly cheering studio audience. We hear the voice of Merv Griffin. 
MERV GRIFFIN (O.S.) Will you please give a warm welcome to... Jeff Spicoli! 
The Merv Griffin Show band begins playing a Merv Griffin Show version of AC/DC's "Highway to Hell". Someone hands Jeff Spicoli a microphone. He works the studio audience into a frenzy as he sings the words to "Highway to Hell": Merv Griffin show style. 
INT. GYMNASIUM - DOORWAY - DAY 
Spicoli wanders into the assembly, takes a seat on a corner bleacher. He sits just below Brad Hamilton and Lisa. 
On podium in front of assembly, Cindy Carr and another cheerleader, Dina Phillips, are making a presentation before the school. 
CINDY I just want to say that we are not 'Spirit Bunnies' anymore. We always hated that name. It bugged the heck out of Dina and me... 
DINA It's just such a put down. 
CINDY They don't call the Chess Club 'Checker Champs' or anything like that. We're going to go to everything this year, you guys. We're going to go to soccer, wrestling, basketball... everything. We know you've got a lot of spirit! Everybody -- riiiiiight? And we're gonna destroy Lincoln next week? Riiiiiiight? 
ANGLE ON THE STUDENTS OF RIDGEMONT 
They don't respond. 
ANGLE ON JEFF SPICOLI 
who is asleep in the bleachers. 
ANGLE ON BRAD AND LISA 
sitting nearby. We hear them over the drone of the assembly. 
BRAD Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again. 
LISA If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back. 
BRAD Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor. 
They sit in silence for a moment. 
BRAD (CONT'D) I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year. 
LISA (sighs) Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing. 
TIGHT ANGLE ON BRAD'S FACE 
as he accepts the news. 
LISA (O.S.) (CONT'D) But I still want to be friends. 
TIGHT ANGLE ON BRAD'S FACE 
as it falls slack. 
INT. GYM - PODIUM IN FRONT OF ASSEMBLY 
CINDY We're going to be going to every game this year. We just want the crowd to participate and we want spirit from every little person in this entire school. Allll-Riiiight? 
There is unenthusiastic, minor applause from the assembled students of Ridgemont High. Vice Principal Ray Connors, a tough-looking man with an H.R. Haldeman crew cut, approaches the podium. He has a sour look on his face. 
CONNORS Well, thank you, girls. People, don't forget, the big game is one week away. We'll see everybody back here on Monday and have a good weekend. 
For the first time during this assembly, there is a loud and hearty applause. 
A GRAINY HIGH SCHOOL FILM 57 
We are suddenly watching a movie shown on a class projection screen. We see footage of a serene, middle-class neighborhood -- as seen through the glass windshield of a car. Judging from the other vehicles parked on the street, the film is from the early Sixties. We hear the narrative voice of Desi Arnaz, speaking in his inimitable Latin accent. 
ARNAZ Driving ess an important part of each and every one of our da-ily lives. Ees a responsibility like no o-ther and ess a matter of life and... 
A ball comes rolling out into the serene street. A small child runs out after it. The driving of our vehicle brakes, but not in time. The film freeze frames on the terrified face of a child about to be splattered. 
ARNAZ (CONT'D) Death. 
There is a swell of dramatic music. 
ARNAZ (CONT'D) They have foun'... The Braking Point. 
The words flash on the screen and we hear a high school Driver's Training class groan in mock horror. 
INT. DRIVER TRAINING CLASS - DAY 
ANGLE ON CHARLES JEFFERSON AND BRAD HAMILTON 
who are seated in this class. 
ANGLE ON LINDA AND STACY 
sitting together in the class. They are oblivious, lost in conversation. 
STACY What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner. 
LINDA Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen? 
STACY Sixteen. 
DAMONE You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts... 
Standing there in the front of the Wherehouse, The Rat nods his head and smiles. He's finally beginning to understand, and we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE RAT'S CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT 
We see The Rat behind the wheel of a green Volvo. Stacy sits beside him. They are driving the streets of Ridgemont. 
INT. THE RAT'S CAR 
This is it. The Big Date. "Led Zeppelin IV" is on the car stereo of his sister's van. 
Finally... 
STACY Thanks for coming to get me. 
THE RAT Sure thing. 
Silence. 
EXT. THE RAT'S CAR 
He rounds the corner of Luna Street, off the neon fast-food stand that is Ridgemont Drive. 
INT. THE RAT'S CAR 
Yet another silence has fallen. Then, after a time... 
STACY This is a nice car. 
THE RAT Yeah. It's my sister's. 
Silence. 
STACY Do you have Mrs. George for English? 
THE RAT Yeah. She is pretty good. 
STACY Yeah. She is pretty good. 
EXT. ATLANTIS RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
They pull into the parking lot of a steak and lobster house called The Atlantis. 
THE RAT Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant. 
STACY I've heard that, too. 
The Rat finds a parking spot near the back of the lot, grateful that the long silence is over. He walks with Stacy to the front of The Atlantis. 
INT. THE ATLANTIS - NIGHT 
The Rat and Stacy are escorted by the host to a nearby table. They are given large wooden menus. 
THE RAT Do you know what you want? 
STACY I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special. 
THE RAT Excellent. 
The Rat leans back in the booth. He is starting to feel in control now. Then something hits him. The panic sweeps across his face. 
Slowly, The Rat reaches back to check his wallet. It's gone. 
STACY Are you all right? 
THE RAT (weakly) Oh yeah. 
Cool. Cool was the name of the game. Stay cool. 
THE RAT (CONT'D) Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment? 
STACY Not at all. 
Just as The Rat is about to get up, the Waitress approaches the table. 
WAITRESS Are you ready to order here? 
THE RAT Well... sure. (settles back down) She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same. 
WAITRESS Anything to drink? 
THE RAT Two Cokes. 
WAITRESS Okay. Thanks. 
The Rat pulls up to Stacy's house in the cul-de sac. He stares straight ahead, like a zombie. 
THE RAT I had a really nice time tonight. 
STACY Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck. 
The Rat nods glumly. 
THE RAT I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez. 
STACY Do you want to come inside? 
THE RAT Aren't your parents asleep? 
STACY No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house. 
THE RAT Okay. Sure. I'll come in. 
We see a confused but interested look on The Rat's face. 
INT. THE HAMILTON HOUSE - EVENING 
They walk in the front door. The Rat stands uncomfortably in the doorway to the living room. 
THE RAT Where's your brother? 
STACY I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink? 
THE RAT No. That's okay. 
STACY Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind. 
THE RAT Naw. I don't mind. 
Stacy turns her back and pulls up her hair. 
STACY Will you unzip me? 
ANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACE 
as the wheels inside his mind start to spin. This can't be what it seems. He unzips Stacy, past her bra, down to the small of her back. It's the first time he's ever done anything like that. 
STACY (CONT'D) Thanks! 
She walks down the hall to her room, easing out of her dress as she walks. She leaves the door to her room open. 
STACY (CONT'D) You can come in, if you want! 
ANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACE 
He is completely unsure of himself, as he begins to walk down the hall. His heart pounds into his throat. He turns the corner and steps into Stacy's room. 
INT. STACY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Stacy stands there, looking gorgeous in an almost seethrough white robe. The Rat pretends not to notice. 
THE RAT So... pretty nice house you've got here. 
STACY Thanks. So... (puts hands on hips) What do you want to do? 
ANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACE 
as he struggles with the memory of Damone's words. "Always call the shots." 
THE RAT I don't know. 
STACY Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right? 
THE RAT Sure. 
Stacy goes to her closet, reaches up to grab the books from the top shelf. The Rat watches her robe slip up her legs. Then she sits down next to him. Her knee grazes his. It is almost too much for The Rat. Go for it. We see The Rat struggle with the action of putting his arm around her. He almost does, but then reacts as she says suddenly... 
STACY This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan? 
THE RAT (looking pained) Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan. 
Her knee grazes him again. Does she expect something? 
THE RAT (CONT'D) Look, Stacy, I want you to know that... 
The Rat struggles. Try as he might, he can't seem to cross the line. He can't make his move. He is woeful as he completes the sentence. 
THE RAT (CONT'D) ... I've got to go home. 
STACY Do you really have to go? 
THE RAT Well... it's getting kind of late. 
Spicoli fingers the bubbles in the wheel. 
SPICOLI (CONT'D) With a genuine Mustang steering wheel, you can negotiate a hairpin turn with ease, my man. 
EXT./INT. MUSTANG 
on the word "ease", Spicoli curls his finger into one of the Mustang steering wheel bubbles and whips it clockwise. The idea is to turn off onto a side street and head back to the party. But instead, at the moment of the hairpin turn, L.C. is attempting to switch the radio station. Spicoli crooks his finger farther into the bubble than he expected. The car swings in a complete circle, a circle that includes a bright yellow fire hydrant. The hydrant rips the side of the car open like a can of tuna. There is a silent moment of terror. 
SPICOLI Are you okay? 
There is silence. Outside the smashed car, the Granada Jocks pass Spicoli and L.C. 
GRANADA JOCKS Fuck youuuuuuuuuu! 
Then L.C. stirs and utters his first words. 
L.C. My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us. 
SPICOLI Just be glad you're all right. 
L.C. My brother is gonna shit. 
SPICOLI Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us? 
L.C. First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.. 
SPICOLI Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car. 
L.C. You can't fix this car, Spicoli. 
ANGLE ON THE BLUE MUSTANG 
waffled and mangled. It is just inches away from scrap iron. 
SPICOLI I can fix it. 
MONTAGE OF SHOTS 
as we see Ridgemont High gearing up for its big Homecoming Game against Lincoln. We see a series of shots of kids talking about it, wagering on the chances of a Ridgemont victory. We see the many signs and placards all over school, proclaiming Ridgemont revenge. We see students lining up to vote for Homecoming King and Queen in the gymnasium. It is the most spirit that Ridgemont has shown this year. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. RIDGEMONT SCHOOL - FLAGPOLE - DAY 
From the back of the parking lot, we see a crowd around the flagpole. A group of kids are staring at something. They sadly shake their heads at the sight, as if they are witnessing a funeral. 
As we draw closer, we see the center of commotion. It is an ugly sight. Someone had wrecked Charles Jefferson's Blue Scholarship Mustang and welded it to the flagpole. Spray-painted on the side was the message: LINCOLN SURF PUNKS RULE. 
EXT. RIDGEMONT BLEACHERS - NIGHT 
The Ridgemont football bleachers are full of cheering students. We see the same basic groups from lunch court, and many more. 
The cheerleaders are on the field -- Cindy Carr, Dina Phillips and company -- and their cheerleader "husbands" sit directly in front of them in the stands. Linda and Stacy sit in the bleachers with some of the Swenson's girls. The Rat and Damone sit several rows above them, watching. The teachers sit together in another section. 
ANGLE ON BRAD HAMILTON 
who is again sitting alone in the bleachers. Watching. Several old lunch court friends pass by, on their way to the concession area. 
STUDENT #1 Hey, Brad! How's going? 
BRAD All right. 
STUDENT #2 Where you working? 
BRAD Fish and chips place. 
STUDENT #1 Which one? 
BRAD Just a fish and chips place. 
Brad says nothing more. The students look at each other. 
STUDENTS We'll be seeing you, Brad! 
BRAD (sullen) Later. 
EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - THE GAME - NIGHT 
Everyone is cheering the amazing game on the field. Charles Jefferson is poised on the offensive line. He mutters a string of obscenities at the opposing Lincoln player. The ball is snapped, and Charles Jefferson comes directly at the player with both elbows up and angled to hit inside his helmet. The Lincoln player is hit and keels over. 
Charles Jefferson sets up for another play. The ball is snapped. Ka-boom. Down falls another Lincoln player. Jefferson doesn't know who it was who wrecked his Mustang, but he wasn't about to spare any of them. There is pure madness in his eyes. It has taken him over. 
The Ridgemont points rack up. Jefferson is single handedly maiming Lincoln for Homecoming. 
EXT. RIDGEMONT BLEACHERS - NIGHT 
We see Jeff Spicoli and L.C. sitting calmly in the bleachers, watching. 
BRAD Does Mom know you have company? 
STACY It's just Linda. And Mark from school. 
Brad ignores the underclassmen, and notices Linda on the board in her maroon bikini. He smiles. 
BRAD Hi, Linda. 
LINDA Hi, Brad. 
BRAD Well, you guys, keep it down. I've got some work to do upstairs. 
Brad turns and heads back inside. He is just out of earshot when they begin talking about him. 
LINDA God, he hardly even talks anymore. 
STACY I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms. 
DAMONE Poor guy. 
THE RAT Really. 
Stacy breaks the spell by jumping into the water, surfacing, and flipping over the tile wall into the Jacuzzi. She sits next to Damone, looking mischievous. 
ANGLE ON DAMONE AND STACY IN THE JACUZZI 
talking while the others are at the other end of the pool. 
ANGLE ON THE RAT 
casually catching sight of them together from the other side of the pool. We can read the emotions on The Rat's face. He is still taken with Stacy, but his big moment for her appears to have passed. 
ANGLE ON DAMONE AND STACY IN THE JACUZZI 
as they talk. 
Underneath the water, her leg accidentally knocks against his. Then he feels her continue. Damone feels Stacy's cool hand on his inner thigh. Moving upwards, stopping just short of the bulge in his trunks. 
ANGLE ON DAMONE'S FACE 
as it loosens and quivers just the slightest bit. This is uncharted territory, even for Mr. Attitude. 
ANGLE ON LINDA 
who is now sunning herself by the side of the pool. She rubs her legs against each other, slowly, enjoying the hot afternoon. 
EXT. BRAD'S WINDOW - ANGLE ON BRAD 
who is watching Linda from the window in his room. We see him from behind, peeking out the curtains. 
EXT. POOL - ANGLE ON LINDA 
who smiles at Damone and flips back into the pool with a splash. Damone steals a look down at his swimsuit. He's popped a big one. 
THE RAT Why don't you get up and do a dive, Mike? 
LINDA Go ahead. 
ANGLE ON DAMONE'S FACE 
and we know he can't get out of the water yet. 
DAMONE No. I don't think so. Not right now. 
THE RAT Chicken! 
Linda, for one, loses interest quickly. Standing by the side of the pool, she jams a finger in her ear and wiggles it. 
LINDA Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips? 
STACY God, I don't think so. Better look in the house. 
Linda towels off and heads back inside the Hamilton house. She knows how to walk. 
INT. BRAD'S BEDROOM AND BATHROOM - AFTERNOON 
We see Brad's room. The Carl's burger picture on the wall is conspicuously missing. There is music playing from his stereo -- Pink Floyd's "You and Me". 
We see Brad. He is kneeling on the bathroom floor, his back to us. His green T-shirt is on, his underwear in a pile on the floor behind him. His arm is pumping slowly. Brad is jacking off. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. HAMILTON POOL - BRAD'S DAYDREAM 
It features Linda Barrett, just as she stood on the diving board a moment ago. She is gorgeous. Her breasts seem even bigger than usual. Her nipples are hard, poking through the film maroon string bikini. Water rolls slowly down her cheeks, into the corners of her mouth. Her lips are parted slightly. Her eyes are filled with desire as she says... 
LINDA Hi, Brad. (pause) You know how cute I always thought you were. I think you're so sexy. Will you come to me? 
STONER #1 There's the pizza. 
STONER #2 Totally! 
Mr. Hand pushes the pizza into their hands and slams the door. 
SPICOLI You better save some for me, you swine! 
MR. HAND And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week. 
Spicoli eases back in his chair, shrugs. It was a good idea at the time. 
INT. CAPTAIN KIDD FISH AND CHIPS - DAY 
Brad Hamilton, looks terribly uncomfortable in his Ponce de Leon hat and buccaneer uniform. He rings up an order for an older Customer. 
CUSTOMER Why aren't you in school, son? 
BRAD I go to school in the mornings. I have a work study program for the afternoon. 
He bags one final coffee and punches up the amount. 
BRAD $8.46, please. 
CUSTOMER Here you go. I have it exactly. (sets money down) Good luck! 
BRAD Thank you, and thanks for coming to Captain Kidd. 
Brad loosens his buccaneer scarf, and starts back towards the kitchen. He is stopped by the sudden appearance of Captain Kidd Assistant Manager, Harold. 
HAROLD Hamilton! I'll take over the fryer. Those boys at IBM need some Catch of-the-Day boxes, and I told them you would personally deliver them within the hour. I'll reimburse you for gas. 
Brad dutifully unhooks his apron, to reveal the bottom half of his pirate suit. 
BRAD Just write me out a bill. 
While Harold leans down to tally up the fish order, Brad goes to a nearby employee's closet. He has completely perfected the art of changing back into his street clothes, and it takes less than a minute. He is just about to finish buttoning his street shirt when Harold sees him. 
HAROLD Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on? 
BRAD This is how I dress all the time. 
HAROLD But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform. 
BRAD I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable. 
Harold can barely fathom the idea. 
HAROLD Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that! 
BRAD You really want me to put all this stuff back on? 
HAROLD Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton. 
ANGLE ON BRAD 
as he stands there, stoic looking. 
BRAD I don't believe you're asking me to do this, but okay. 
He begins taking off his street shirt. He looks at Harold, looks at the boxes, and returns to the closet. 
INT. THE CRUISING VESSEL 
Brad is driving down the freeway, listening to the music of Bruce Springsteen's "Out in the Streets." He pries open one of the fourteen Catch-of-the-Day boxes on the seat next to him and pulls out a small piece of fried fish. Brad takes a bite. The look on his face says it is the worst piece of shit he has ever tasted. He throws the piece out the window, and drives on. 
Brad turns to see a girl smiling at him from another car. It makes his afternoon. He returns the smile with gusto. 
ANGLE ON THE GIRL 
as she bursts out laughing and drives away. 
ANGLE ON BRAD 
looking perplexed. Then he realizes that he hasn't taken his Ponce de Leon hat off. Brad drives on. 
A SERIES OF ANGLES ON BRAD'S CAR 
as we see the Cruising Vessel move down the highway. We see the Captain Kidd hat go flying out the window. Then the plastic sword, and the scarf. Then a couple boxes of Captain Kidd fish. Then the rest of them. We see Brad rip past the IBM Building. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. RIDGEMONT HIGH SCHOOL - AFTERNOON 
School is out and kids are leaving campus, heading for the parking lot and bus stop. We see Mike Damone carrying some books, walking towards Ridgemont Drive. He is joined by Stacy Hamilton, who hurries to catch up to him. 
STACY I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag. 
STACY It's okay if it's your first time. 
She gives him a kiss. 
DAMONE Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend. 
STACY He's my friend, too. 
She gives him another kiss. He kisses her in return. Standing there, feeling Stacy in her bikini, feeling her kiss him, Damone also felt some of his reservations slip away. 
DAMONE You're a really good kisser. 
STACY So are you. (pause) Are you shaking? 
DAMONE (shaking) No. Are you crazy? 
It is clear that this is as far as Mr. Attitude has ever gotten with a girl. Stacy takes the initiative, rubbing her hands through his hair, rubbing his sides, kissing his neck, then pulling away. 
STACY (whispers) Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike? 
DAMONE You first. 
STACY How about both of us at the same time? 
Damone nods, and watches as Stacy unhooks her top and steps out of her bikini bottom. She stands naked in the shadows of the afternoon sun. She sits down naked on a red changing room couch, and gathers her legs up to her chest. She watches as Damone struggles with his clothes. 
ANGLE ON DAMONE 
hopping on one leg, pulling first out of his pants, then his jockey underwear. Bashfully, he goes to sit next to Stacy on the couch. They begin to kiss, and it quickly escalates into heavy petting. Stacy pulls away. 
STACY I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not. 
DAMONE Let's continue. 
Stacy leans back and pulls him on top of her. He enters her and begins pumping so hard, so fast, that he doesn't notice he's banging the sofa into the wall of the changing room. 
But just as quickly as Damone starts, he stops. 
STACY (whispers) Hey, Mike? 
DAMONE What? Are you all right? 
STACY I think we're making a lot of noise. 
DAMONE I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. 
He has a strange look on his face. 
STACY What's wrong? 
DAMONE I think I came. Didn't you feel it? 
STACY I guess I did. 
They lay there, Damone still on top of her on the red couch. 
ANGLE ON DAMONE 
as we read the confusion on his face. He is embarrassed, a little confused... mostly he just wants to be alone. 
DAMONE I've got to get home. I've really got to go, Stacy. 
ANGLE ON STACY 
as she looks up at him. She gives him a kiss. Damone gets up puts his pants and shirt on. He leaves the changing room. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - AFTERNOON 
We see Stacy sitting at her usual seat, and she's wearing a bright spring dress with a slight amount of makeup. She looks at Damone's seat with anticipation, but it remains empty as other students file in. Finally, she turns to The Rat. 
STACY Where's Mike today? 
THE RAT Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th. 
STACY What's April 16th? 
THE RAT It's John Bonham's birthday. 
STACY John Bonham? 
THE RAT John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday. 
STACY Oh. I see. 
The bell rings, and Mr. Vargas enters the room with his Sanka cup. 
A student raises his hand. 
MR. VARGAS Yes, Randy? 
RANDY Who are these guys? 
MR. VARGAS Most of them were derelicts, Randy. They sold the right for medical examination of their bodies for money. Something like thirty dollars, I believe. Isn't that right, Doctor Miller? 
DR. MILLER Twenty-five dollars. 
ANGLE ON JEFF SPICOLI 
who turns to Stacy. 
SPICOLI Twenty-five bucks is pretty good. 
MR. VARGAS Now this gentleman here is named Arthur. Arthur died from heart failure last week and we are fortunate enough to view his body in its pristine state. 
Mr. Vargas suddenly pulls the white sheet aside and we see the body of Arthur. The students' eyes widen. Some gasp. Others cover their mouths. Others begin furious notes. Nobody speaks. The body of Arthur is smallish and withered. It is orange, flaky, and not quite real looking. A deep cut has been made in Arthur's chest. 
Mr. Vargas bends Arthur upright for a better student view. He gestures to the deep cut made in Arthur's chest. 
The tension mounts. 
MR. VARGAS (CONT'D) This incision allows us to pull aside the skin covering of the chest cavity and really observe the human organs as they exist in their natural state. 
ANGLE ON ARTHUR 
and his shrunken face, which seems to say please don't. 
MR. VARGAS (CONT'D) I want all of you to take a look at the chest cavity for just a moment. 
Mr. Vargas grabs the two sides of Arthur's chest cavity covering, and rips it open. 
MR. VARGAS (CONT'D) Here we have the human lungs and heart, which you can see is actually located in the center of your chest. 
With a squish, Mr. Vargas reaches inside Arthur and pulls out the human heart for display. The class stands in silent shock. Only one comment escapes from any of them. 
SPICOLI Bitchin'. 
ANGLE ON STACY HAMILTON 
who goes running out of the "Cold Room", holding her mouth. The Rat runs after her. 
INT. BOTTOM FLOOR HALL 
Rat and Stacy sit side-by-side on some orange plastic chairs, by a nurse's desk. Stacy is shook up. 
STACY I made a fool of myself. 
THE RAT Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in. 
STACY What about the notes? 
THE RAT I'll get you the notes. 
She squeezes his arm. 
EXT. HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON 
The students file out of the hospital, looking like they've just been through a war. 
INT. LINDA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
It is night, and Linda and Stacy are watching Fantasy Island. 
MONTALBAN You see, Tatoo, what this man doesn't realize is that he must one day leave Fantasy Island. And he must continue his life as an incurable leper. 
Stacy is fighting back tears. Linda looks angry. 
Telephone rings. Linda jumps to get it. 
LINDA Hello. 
Linda obviously is disappointed when she hears a female voice. 
LINDA (CONT'D) Yeah... you're kidding... What did he say... What did you say... How much did it cost? Look, tell him he can have a relationship with you or a 'more open' relationship with someone else... Listen, Debbie, can I call you later. I'm waiting for Doug to call. 
She plops back on the couch with Stacy. 
LINDA (CONT'D) I'll bet he forgets to call again. 
She notices that Stacy is crying over the TV show. 
LINDA (CONT'D) God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban. 
STACY I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing. 
Stacy stands there, hands folded, nodding. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. DAMONE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON 
He is working at his desk, counting through a wad of money. 
ANGLE ON THE LIST 
in front of him, which has a split line down the middle. People Who Owe Me -- fifteen dollars Rick. People I Owe -seventy-five dollars REO Speedwagon tickets, seventy-five dollars abortion. Damone counts fifteen dollars into his stack, crosses out Rick. Then he counts through the money. Seventy five dollars exactly. He crosses out REO Speedwagon tickets. This leaves him no money for the abortion. 
EXT. STREET CORNER - AFTERNOON 
Here, at the same corner where she once waited for Ron Johnson, Stacy waits for Damone. Cars pass, no Damone. 
INT. HAMILTON HOUSE - AFTERNOON 
Stacy is on the phone, calling Damone. We see the phone messages sheet that lists two calls for Stacy, and none for Brad. The line rings four times, then it's answered. 
FEMALE VOICE Hello? 
STACY Hello... is Mike there? 
FEMALE VOICE Hold on. 
Stacy sags, disbelieving, and looks at the clock on the kitchen wall. It's getting late... 
FEMALE VOICE (CONT'D) He says he's helping his father in the garage and he'll call you back. 
Stacy is stunned. 
FEMALE VOICE (CONT'D) Hello? 
Stacy hangs up. She punches out another number, quickly. 
MRS. BARRETT (V.O.) Hello? 
STACY Hi, Mrs. Barrett. Is Linda there? 
MRS. BARRETT (V.O.) She went off to the beach. She'll be back later, though. 
STACY Okay. Thanks. 
She looks at the clock again, then hears a noise in the driveway. 
STACY (CONT'D) Brad! Hey, wait a second! 
She runs out. 
EXT. CRUISING VESSEL - AFTERNOON 
Brad and Stacy pull up next to the flea market. 
STACY Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do. 
BRAD See you later. 
STACY Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it. 
She gets out of the car. 
EXT. FLEA MARKET 
Stacy Hamilton watches her brother drive away. Then she looks to both sides, and walks on. She passes the entrance to the Flea Market. She walks around the corner to another building marked BIRTH CONTROL - FREE CLINIC. Brad follows her in the rearview mirror. 
INT. BIRTH CONTROL CLINIC 
Stacy is lying in bed wearing a paper dress. Her hair is stuffed in paper shower cap. She looks anxious. In a bed next to her an older girl is being affectionate with her visiting boyfriend. 
A Nurse comes in with an IV. 
NURSE This is going to prick a little. 
She sticks the needle into Stacy's hand. Stacy looks pained but doesn't yell. The Nurse pats the rolling bed. 
NURSE (CONT'D) Now scoot over here. 
Stacy moves onto it. Looking up from her point of view, we see the ride out of the room and into: 
INT. OPERATING ROOM 
Stacy gets wheeled in. The Doctor looks down at her. 
DOCTOR Hello, Stacy, I'm Doctor Bartell. 
Stacy moves onto the operating table as the Nurse and Doctor get ready. 
EXT. DAMONE CAR 
Mike Damone travels down Ridgemont Drive, making the turn into the school parking lot. There is a large cardboard panel taped on the side of his car. 
EXT. DAMONE'S LOCKER 
He arrives at his locker, where, in white spray paint, there is another message: LITTLE PRICK. Several girls walk by, they laugh knowingly. 
GIRL #1 Hi, Mike! 
GIRL #2 Hi, mike! 
Damone backs up against the locker, with a sick smile on his face. 
DAMONE Hi... girls. 
More students pass, looking strangely at the young man pinned against his own locker. 
EXT. BOY'S LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON 
Damone exits the boys locker room. Just as he does, he is accosted by The Rat. We have never quite heard this tone in The Rat's voice before. 
THE RAT Damone? What happened between you and Stacy? 
Damone feigns The Attitude, shakes his head. Damone sighs. 
DAMONE Let me tell you something, Rat. Sometimes girls just go haywire. It was a month ago, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you ever since. We started messing around and... (shrugs) ... something happened. It's all over with. It's no big deal. I never called her again. 
The Rat says nothing. 
DAMONE (CONT'D) If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying? 
THE RAT No Damone. I don't understand. 
DAMONE She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway. 
THE RAT Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove? 
DAMONE Jesus. I'm sorry. 
THE RAT I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out. 
DAMONE Fine. Get lost. 
Damone starts to push past him, but The Rat shoves his shoulder hard. 
DAMONE (CONT'D) All right, Rat. You want to do something about it? 
Damone begins the classic high school fighting ritual. He throws his books down. He takes a step back. He goes into a crouch. He gestures towards himself. Then Damone says the universally recognized high school fighting words. 
DAMONE (CONT'D) Well come on. 
The Rat shows no fear. As other kids begin to crowd around the two boys, Rat throws his own books down. He takes a step back, goes into the crouch. He gestures toward himself. 
THE RAT You come on. 
They stand there, gesturing, neither one of them wanting to make the first move. 
DAMONE No. You come on, you wuss. 
Assistant Coach Mr. Sexton comes running out of the boy's locker room, and steps in front of the two boys. 
SEXTON Hey! Knock this crap off!! 
The Rat stalks off, disappearing into the crowd of onlookers. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. RIDGEMONT DRIVE - NIGHT 
The Ridgemont Drive strip is filled with cars, cruising for parties. There is a lot of honking, and yelling out windows. Everyone is headed towards the beach. We stay on a lowly 7-11 store near the freeway entrance. 
EXT. 7-11 STORE - NIGHT 
A yellow Firebird slowly, menacingly cruises the empty parking lot. It does not stop. 
Then, around the corner, walks Jeff Spicoli. We see him in the neon 7-11 light, his hands stuffed deep into the pockets of baggy jeans. He walks inside the store. He is the only shopper. 
INT. 7-11 STORE 
Brad Hamilton stands behind the counter in a red and white striped shirt and cap, making fresh coffee. Jeff Spicoli trudges up to the counter. He looks at Brad. Brad looks at Spicoli. There is an unspoken edge between them. 
SPICOLI Hey, mon, can I use the bathroom? 
Brad squints his eyes, looks at the sign on the back room door. 
ANGLE ON

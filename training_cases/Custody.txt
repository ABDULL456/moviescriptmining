Eric Stuyvesant 
FADE IN: 
EXT. AKRON'S CANAL PARK - DAY 
RICK STEVENS, thirty-six, is Middle America personified. He blends in at the crowded ballpark. Blue jeans, work boots, a ball cap and leather jacket complete his attire. He snacks on a bag of popcorn. The CRACK of the bat and the CROWD is on their feet. A BALL PLAYER slides safely into second with a double. JOHN SILVERSTEIN, thirty-three, business clad, talks on his cell phone. Calm and collected he appears unaffected by the cheering crowd. The sits with the crowd. 
RICK Helluva talent, that kid. 
John flashes a quick grin, never missing a beat in his phone call. 
RICK Probably be in the bigs in another year. 
John nods, smiles and turns away from Rick to continue uninterrupted. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MELANIE'S HOUSE 
MELANIE SIMMERS, twenty-four, scurries around a sparse, but neatly adorned house getting dressed. 
MELANIE Zach? Are you ready? Mommy, can't be late again. 
CUT TO: INT. MELANIE'S HOUSE - ZACH'S BEDROOM 
ZACH SIMMERS, six, sits on his bed in pajamas. 
ZACH I'm ready. 
Melanie ENTERS. 
MELANIE Come on baby. Don't do this to mommy. Not today. 
ZACH I don't want to go. Melanie hastily dresses her son. 
MELANIE Zach, do you want mommy to get fired? 
ZACH Yes. 
MELANIE If I get fired we won't have the money to go to Six Flags. Zach quickly dresses himself. CUT TO: 
EXT. AKRON'S CANAL PARK - DAY 
John still talks on his cell. 
RICK Must be something to have that kind of talent. He's just a kid, nineteen, twenty tops, and if he stays healthy and he stays focused, the world is his oyster. Guys like you and me, we squandered those opportunities long ago. 
John ends his call and turns back to Rick. 
JOHN You. 
RICK Huh? JOHN Guys like you... 
RICK And me... 
JOHN ... squandered opportunities. I, on the other hand, knew where I was going. I had that kind of drive, I just never had the talent. 
RICK You knew where you were going? 
JOHN Absolutely. 
RICK At nineteen? 
JOHN Without question. 
RICK The only thing I knew for certain was that I would run to the corner store every day for beer. 
CUT TO: EXT. DAIRY MART - DAY 
Melanie pulls into a parking space and turns the car off. 
Melanie and Zach stand at the counter. The CLERK rings them out. Zach grabs the bottle from the counter. 
ZACH I want Sobe. 
Melanie snatches the bottle back. 
MELANIE Too bad. 
An impatient LINE OF CUSTOMERS waits. 
ZACH I don't want Coke. I want Sobe. 
Melanie puts the bottle back on the counter. 
MELANIE (To clerk.) We'll take the soda. 
Zach stomps his feet. 
CLERK Two dollars and... MELANIE Hold on a minute. Please? 
CUSTOMER Come on lady. 
A beat as Zach and Melanie exchange glares. 
MELANIE Get your Sobe. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MAIN STREET - AKRON OHIO - DAY 
The crowd has waned. 
RICK I thought I got direction... 
JOHN When Cindy had kids? RICK Yeah... 
JOHN They gave you purpose. But purpose, my friend, is not direction. 
RICK East. 
JOHN Huh? 
RICK My direction is east. I parked in the deck. 
JOHN I'm right around the... 
RICK Corner? 
JOHN Yeah. 
RICK We're always going in different directions. JOHN Mine are much more productive. 
RICK And much less adventurous. 
JOHN Well, I'm gonna... 
RICK Go? 
JOHN Yeah. 
RICK Then go. 
JOHN That's what I'm going to do. Responsibility calls. John turns and heads south. Rick takes a bite of popcorn, looks to the sky for a moment, grins, and heads off Northeast. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MELANIE'S CAR - DAY 
Zach takes a long swig of Sobe. 
ZACH Sobe sucks. I want Coke. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MAIN STREET - AKRON OHIO - DAY 
Officer's POV: Slowly driving past, the officers recognize Rick. 
OFFICER TWO It's him... get him, get him, get him. They curb the car in front of Rick. 
EXT. AKRON'S BUCHTEL AVE - DAY Rick appears dumbfounded as the officers exit the cruiser with guns drawn. Officer One remains stationary. Officer Two circles behind Rick. 
OFFICER ONE Get em up. Up I said... up. 
RICK Huh? 
OFFICER TWO Get `em where we can see `em slimeball. 
Rick raises his hands, dropping his popcorn. 
OFFICER ONE Oh, we got ourselves a litterbug here. 
RICK What? 
Placing his pistol back in his holster Officer Two grabs Rick by the collar and throws him against the cruiser. Officer One remains drawn on Rick. His hands shake with nervous anticipation. 
RICK What's going... 
OFFICER ONE Shaddup! 
Officer Two cuffs Rick. Leaning in, he speaks in Rick's ear. 
OFFICER TWO You know your rights, cretin, but just in case you don't... 
RICK What the hell? Officer Two spins Rick to face him. 
OFFICER TWO You have the right to shut the hell up. Do you understand this right? 
RICK Yes. 
Officer One appears very eager to discharge his weapon. 
OFFICER ONE Shut him the hell up, Jimmy. 
OFFICER TWO If you don't shut the hell up my partner might exercise his right to shoot you. Do you understand? 
`Yes' begins to form on Rick's lips. A quick glance at Officer One and he decides to nod. 
OFFICER ONE He's looking at me funny, Jimmy. 
OFFICER TWO You have the right not to look at my partner in any way that might be construed as `funny' which could result in harm to your person. Do you understand this right? 
Rick nods again. 
OFFICER ONE He twitching? 
OFFICER TWO Really? I don't think he is. Are you twitching boy? RICK No Sir. 
OFFICER ONE Look at him, he's twitching. Nothing pisses me off more than twitching and talking. If he doesn't stop I'm gonna waste him. 
OFFICER TWO You have the right not to twitch or shiver or make any other odd movements that might encourage my partner to discharge his weapon, do you understand? 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAR DEALERSHIP 
Melanie grabs her stuff. BOSS You never answered about tonight. 
MELANIE You're making a huge mistake. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BUCHTEL AVE. - DAY 
An unmarked car pulls on scene. The door opens. Low in on walking feet and pan up to reveal DETECTIVE JOHNSON, (50's), a gruff man in tweed. 
DETECTIVE JOHNSON What do we got here boys? 
OFFICER TWO It's him. We got him. 
OFFICER ONE He's a twitcher... a twitcher and a talker. Boy, I tell you, if he'd twitched one more time I would've deposited large amounts of hot lead in his ass. 
Rick steps forward and the lights dim on the other four. Caught in the spotlight, Rick squints from the brightness. The lady in black shifts in her seat. A long beat. 
LADY IN BLACK That's him. 
DETECTIVE JOHNSON You're positive? 
LADY IN BLACK I'm positive. That's the man that needs to be in custody. 
The detective keys his microphone once again. 
DETECTIVE JOHNSON Okay number three step back. Rick does as he's told. DETECTIVE JOHNSON Turn to your right --- all of you... 
The group follows the detective's instruction. 
DETECTIVE JOHNSON ...and exit. 
One by one the men filter through the door. Rick EXITS. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. THEATER - CONTINUOUS 
Rick ENTERS on stage. The entire theater is cast in shades of gray. The stage is barren. There is no audience. He looks around for a moment and as he reaches center stage is once again flooded with the spotlight. Rick uses his arm to shade his eyes. SFX: A SOFT DIN OF VOICES. Looking stage left Rick realizes TWELVE JURORS have appeared in their box. A small AUDIENCE has congregated. SFX: THE DIN SWELLS TO A QUIET CHAOS. A RAPPING of a gavel and Rick's attention swings to a white haired JUDGE (70's). 
JUDGE Order in the court. 
The noise level wanes, but not completely. Another RAP of the gavel. 
JUDGE Order in the court, I say. 
Focused on the Judge, Rick doesn't notice THE PROSECUTOR approaching from stage right. 
Carrying a folding chair in one hand, notes and manila folders in the other, he sets the chair behind Rick. 
PROSECUTOR Have a seat. 
JUDGE Do you know why you're here today, Mr. Stevens? 
RICK Why am I here? 
JUDGE Are you being rhetorical? 
RICK Are you asking me? 
JUDGE You stand here today an accused man. 
RICK Accused? Accused of what? 
JUDGE You have been placed in custody of your children. 
RICK Huh? 
PROSECUTOR Your children, Mr. Stevens. You do realize you have children, don't you? 
RICK Yes, but... 
PROSECUTOR But nothing Mr. Stevens, either you have children or you don't. 
RICK I do. 
PROSECUTOR So, you accept responsibility for bringing young life into the world? 
RICK I guess... 
PROSECUTOR There's no guessing, Mr. Stevens, either you're responsible for siring offspring or you aren't. 
RICK I am, but I'm not sure it was responsible. 
PROSECUTOR A crime of passion, Mr. Stevens? How convenient. (A beat) And you accept the consequences of said actions? RICK Why am I here? 
PROSECUTOR Why are you here, Mr. Stevens? Why are you here? I'll tell you why you're here. Are you familiar with Ms. Cynthia Stevens? 
RICK Yeah, she's my wife. 
PROSECUTOR Was your wife, Sir. Was your wife. She recently filed for divorce. Were you aware of that? 
MRS. NELSON Lots of single parents are married. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUMMIT COUNTY JAIL - CELL 
Rick sits alone, his head hung low. A JAILER, (40's) approaches leading THREE YOUNG CHILDREN to the cell. KRIS, (8), is followed by PHILLIP, (6), and NICHOLAS, (4). The door swings open. The children run to their father. 
KRIS Daddy! 
RICK Hi guys. 
PHILLIP I love you daddy. 
RICK I love you too, Phillip. 
NICHOLAS I love you more. 
RICK I love you more. 
NICHOLAS I love YOU more. 
KRIS Daddy, how come you're in jail? 
PHILLIP Is this where we live? 
KRIS When can we see mommy? 
RICK Come here guys. I want to talk to you. The boys gather round. 
PHILLIP What's wrong Daddy? 
RICK I don't know when we're going to see your mom again. KRIS Is she okay? 
RICK She's kind of mad at daddy. 
NICHOLAS Mommy mad at me too? 
RICK No, baby, not at all. Your mom needs time to work through some things. So, for awhile, it's just going to be us... 
KRIS What's she need time for? 
RICK To figure out who she is, where she's going, what she wants. 
NICHOLAS I miss mommy. 
RICK She misses you too, baby. And this isn't permanent... we're going to fight this... we're going to appeal. We'll take it to the Supreme Court if we have to. KRIS You don't want us either? 
RICK Of course I want you. I just don't think I should have to do this alone. 
The jailer still lingers in the doorway, leaning against the bars. 
JAILER I feel for you, I really do, but I've seen your kind before. You're a lifer. Whether it's fair or not. Whether justice was served. It doesn't matter. You're here for the duration. 
The boys cling to their father. The CLANK of the door being closed. The Jailer WHISTLES a sad spiritual as he walks away. CUT TO:

MELANIE You can afford that? 
ZACH If it keeps my mommy home with me. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FRANK RYAN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Rick sits across the desk from FRANK RYAN, (40): An uncouth Italian man who seems content to stuff his face with a submarine sandwich and speak through his mastication. FRANK So, needless to say, I understand your situation. My old lady, she took off and left me with the kids five years ago. That bitch. But I'm not bitter or anything. I found me a good day care and moved on with my life. You should too. 
RICK It's hard... 
FRANK Of course it's hard, sometimes feels like you're in prison, but you gotta be a man... stand up for yourself... provide for your family. 
RICK And you can help? FRANK Me? I'll put ya to work. Some long hours, but it all pays off. Keeps you off the welfare system if ya know what I mean. 
RICK Yeah.

RICK No, you seemed to cover everything. Ms. Heath bends down to the kid's level. MS. HEATH You're going to like it here. 
The kids grab Rick's leg. Nicholas cries.

PHILLIP Do that again and my daddy's going to kick your ass. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY AREA 
Phillip runs down the hall with a huge butterfly bandage on his head. He stops to chat with all the NURSES. Rick walks a few steps behind carrying his coat. The doctor hurries to catch up with Rick. 
RICK Look I'm really sorry. 
DOCTOR Can I ask you something? 
Rick shifts uncomfortably. 
RICK Sure, I guess. 
DOCTOR My son's a wuss. He cries over hangnails. My wife and I have tried everything to toughen him up, but nothing works. I was wondering if our kids could play together. Maybe some of Phillip's "boy" would rub off on Junior. CUT TO:

MOTHER Find a way. Everything happens for a reason. God doesn't abandon his children, and neither will you. 
RICK God doesn't pay day-care. 
MOTHER There are other things out there... less expensive ways. 
RICK Could you watch them? 
MOTHER Oh... uh... well... I don't think your father is willing to do that. We raised our kids, Rick. 
RICK How `bout tonight, so I can catch a breath? 
MOTHER What? My watching them while you were in there with Phillip wasn't enough? Make me feel guilty.

MOTHER Rick!

Carrie stands.

CUT TO: 
INT. SMALL SUBURBAN HOME 
Rick on the sofa. The boys gathered at his feet. He has a heavy growth of facial hair. He shirt is unbuttoned. His shoes have been discarded. He stares blankly forward. The boys lay sleeping at his feet. One by one PEOPLE show up and begin to remove the furnishings. An open door allows SERVICE PROVIDERS to ENTER and disconnect. First the gas, then the telephone. CLOSE UP on a running faucet that slows to a trickle, then a drip, then dry. Rick's Mother and Father ENTER. She sits by her unresponsive son. Father lingers at a distance. 
MOTHER Rick?... Rick?... Rick? 
She stuffs a few dollars in his pocket as the CABLE GUY shows up. The reception on the TV turns to snow. 
MOTHER Take care of my babies. 
Rick never acknowledges her. She kisses him on the forehead and LEAVES. 
INT. RICK'S PARENT'S HOME - BEDROOM 
Close in on a bed where Rick's parents lay. 
FATHER What are you giving him money for? 
Rick sits at the picnic table reading a book. The boys are off playing. Kris falls. He grabs his knee and cries. Rick drops his book and runs to the child. GUARDS on duty pay no attention. Rick reaches the child. The injury appears rather serious. 
RICK (Calling out.) Can I get some help here. 
His calls go unanswered. 
A tear forms in his eyes. Months of frustration boil in his face. A CONVICT passing by kneels by Rick. 
RICK Can you help me? 
CONVICT Can you help him? 
RICK I don't know. 
CONVICT What does he need? 
RICK I don't know. 
CONVICT He needs a father, not a book reading baby-sitter. 
RICK (In a hushed rage) I can't fucking do this. 
CONVICT Yes you can. 
The convict runs his hand over the child's leg and everything appears healed. 
CONVICT Use your mind and your heart. It's different than it ever should have been... but different isn't wrong. 
RICK But I... 
CONVICT Use what you have. There is a vein of wealth inside you just waiting to be mined. Think differently than you have ever thought before. Worker harder than you ever thought you could. Love these children like they've never been loved before. 
RICK How? 
CONVICT The answer lies within. Quit worrying about how these misguided events have torn your life apart. Quit dwelling on all of your misgivings. Look around you. You're not alone. But you, and you alone, will make the difference.

INT. SUMMIT COUNTY JAIL - HALL 
Rick notices his cell door is unlocked. He steps into the corridor. Rick's POV: Walking past cells he sees people he knows. His mother and father appear very old. Melanie is at Mrs. Nelson's house. Zach clings to her leg. Carrie's angry. John talks away his phone. 
FADE TO: 
INT. WELFARE OFFICE 
Rick and the boys wait for their caseworker. A pregnant WOMAN and her TWELVE CHILDREN sit a few seats away. Her face and clothes are as dirty as her children's. Rick looks at his watch, and then at her, and then back to his watch. He slips the watch off his wrist and hands it to her. 
RICK It's not worth a lot, maybe a few hundred bucks, but it might keep you in soap for a year. 
A CASEWORKER comes to Rick. 
CASE WORKER Mr. Stevens, I can see you now. Rick and the Pregnant Woman lock eyes. 
PREGNANT WOMAN I ain't some charity case. I know what you think when you look at me. You think; Look at that poor, poor woman. Look at those poor, poor children. How unfortunate it must be that they only have a mother. How terrible it must be not to know their father. 
CASE WORKER Mr. Stevens? 
RICK I didn't mean it like that? 
PREGNANT WOMAN No one ever does. 
CASE WORKER Mr. Stevens? 
Rick and the woman continue their stare. 
CASE WORKER Mr. Stevens? I can see you now. RICK I'm sorry, I'm going to have to reschedule. 
CASE WORKER Excuse me? 
RICK Responsibility calls.

MELANIE Rick's ex-wife? 
CINDY And you are? 
MELANIE Can I ask you a question? What is Phillip's favorite color? 
CINDY Huh? 
MELANIE Blue. His favorite color is blue. How many teeth has Kris lost? 
CINDY I don't know. Why? 
MELANIE Four. Two on top and two on bottom. He got a quarter for the first one, fifty cents for the next two and he parlayed the last into an even dollar. Nicholas cries at night because he thinks the house is filled with ghosts. Kiss him once on the forehead, once on the cheek and sing The Cradle Will Rock and he'll sleep the whole night through. Kris' favorite subject is math. He loves to read and write, but he doesn't do so well in social studies. He knows how to ride a bike. Why? Because I taught him. Phillip wants to learn but he's always afraid he'll fall. Nicky just likes to Flintstone his tricycle. Phillip's favorite cartoon is Tunenami. (MOR E) 
MEL ANIE (cont'd) He's afraid of the dark and cries himself to sleep at night saying his mommy doesn't love him. 
CINDY What's your point? 
MELANIE I'm more their mom than you'll ever be. 
CINDY So, why are you here with slick and not with "your" kids? 
A beat. MELANIE Things change. 
CINDY Yeah... yeah they do. Now if you'll excuse me I need to find the asparagus. (A beat) I couldn't do it, ya know? 
Melanie turns back around. 
MELANIE Do what? 
CINDY I always thought I wanted to be a parent, and I was really good at being pregnant, but I sucked as a mom. I know that now. I don't have what it takes. MELANIE I don't think I've ever felt as much pity for anyone as I do for you right now. 
CINDY Take care of my boys... all of them.

EXT. GORGE PARK - DAY 
Rick and the boys stand by the river looking up a huge embankment. There appears to be no permanent trail. Looking up, scattered PEOPLE sit at different levels on the climb. 
RICK Well, guys, I guess this is it. 
KRIS We can do it daddy. 
RICK Yes we can. 
Rick stretches out. The boys jog in place. Rick cracks his neck. The boys crack their knuckles. In SLOW MOTION they begin their ascent, running wildly up the incline. Rick falls flat on his face. The boys all trip over him, leaving them all in a pile. Rick bounces up and dusts himself off. The boys do the same and away they go. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. A LARGE ESTATE IN BATH - DAY 
Rick and the boys are on their hands and knees with hand trimmers snipping away at the lawn. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. GORGE PARK - DAY 
Rick caries the boys. Phillip is draped across his shoulder. Nicholas hangs around his neck. Kris clings to Rick's leg and is dragged with each step. They pass a weary CLIMBER who has taken a moment to catch his breath. CLIMBER You can do it. 
RICK Yes we can.

Rick is using a push mower on this huge estate. Nicholas follows behind with a bubble mower.

CUT TO: EXT. GORGE PARK - DAY 
Rick and the boys stop to rest. Kris throws a rock while Rick is looking away. Rick looks up to find Phillip picking up a stone. 
RICK Put the stone down. 
PHILLIP But... 
RICK No buts: Put the stone down. 
Off Screen SFX: A huge thud and someone rolling down the hill. 
RICK I knew this was a hard climb, but... A RESTING CLIMBER appears. 
RESTING CLIMBER Long way up. 
RICK Yeah. 
RESTING CLIMBER Long way down for that matter. 
RICK That too. 
A beat. 
RICK So, what's your point. 
RESTING CLIMBER No point, just an observation. Drink? 
The climber holds out a canteen. 
RICK I'm okay. 
RESTING CLIMBER For the boys. 
NICHOLAS Daddy, I'm thirsty. Rick studies the climber for a moment. 
RICK Go ahead. 
The climber hands the boys the canteen. 
RESTING CLIMBER You know, if you stop here, halfway between a long way up and a long way down you really haven't accomplished much, have you? 
RICK We're not stopping. We're just resting. 
RESTING CLIMBER That's what I said, fourteen years ago. Rick looks toward the top. RICK We can do this. 
RESTING CLIMBER Yes you can. 
A reinvigorated Rick hops to his feet. 
RICK We can do this! 
BOYS IN UNISON Yes we can!

INT. THEATER 
Rick is back on the stage. The audience is full. 
PROSECUTOR What is so important Mr. Stevens that you would burden this court with convening today? 
RICK I just needed clarification. 
PROSECUTOR On what, Mr. Stevens? On what? 
RICK I know if I have to, I can do this alone, but do I have to do this alone? A hushed MURMUR rises in the audience. The Judge RAPS his gavel on the bench. 
JUDGE Order in this court! A beat as things quiet down. 
CUSTOMER 2 The coffee, it's cold. 
Rick picks up the cup, pulls a lighter from his pocket and runs it several times under the mug. 
RICK (Setting the cup back down.) Quit your bitching. 
Rick moves to Melanie. 
MELANIE I can't believe you came here. 
RICK I can't believe you're a waitress. 
MELANIE Beats chasing around after snot nosed brats all day. 
RICK I thought you liked my kids. 
MELANIE I was talking about you. Melanie moves on. Rick gives chase. He catches her and spins her around spilling coffee all over the floor. 
RICK I deserved that. 
MELANIE So, what do the kids need? A babysitter? A surrogate mom? 
RICK This isn't about the kids. 
MELANIE Then what's it about? 
RICK It's about me, the selfish prick. 
MELANIE About you? RICK Hear me out, okay? 
MELANIE (Looking at her watch.) You have 15 seconds. 
RICK Okay, okay. 
MELANIE Ten. 
RICK Melanie, there is a grace about you that reminds me how clumsy I am. There is an honesty about you that reminds me how deceitful I can be. There is a beauty in your eyes that reminds me how ugly I've become. There is a kindness in your voice that contradicts my coarseness. There is a glow around you that illuminates my dullness. There is spirit in you that challenges my laziness, but most of all, there is a woman in you, that sparks my desire, a desire to be graceful and honest and beautiful and kind. A desire to be better than I am or ever thought I could be. 
MELANIE Go on. 
RICK I think my ten seconds are up. 
MELANIE Who's counting? 
CUSTOMER 2 Miss... My coffee? 
Melanie sets the coffee on a nearby table. 
MELANIE Get it yourself. 
RICK I love you. MELANIE I don't think I heard you. 
RICK If I give you my heart will you promise to treat it softly? Kiss it when it hurts? Put it in a box and know that it belongs to you? 
MELANIE That's not what you said. 
RICK I said I love you. 
MELANIE As brutal as that can be? 
RICK I love you. I love you, I love you, I love you. 
MELANIE I kind of like you too. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. GORGE PARK - DAY 
Rick comes to another plateau and finds Melanie waiting for him. MELANIE I never thought you'd make it. 
RICK Been waiting long? 
MELANIE I never thought you'd find me. 
RICK I had to find me first. I hope you plan on walking, cause I'm not sure I can carry you.

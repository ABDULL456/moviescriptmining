CLOSE ON A PAGE OF A LARA CROFT COMIC BOOK 
Being copied, with uncanny precision, down to the last detail, by a ten year old hand clutching a pencil. 
VOICE Cataleya! 
The page of a notebook turns, revealing neat cursive handwriting, covers the comic. 
PULL BACK TO 
INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY 
CATALEYA RESTREPO, CAT for short, a contained, very centered 10 year old, pretty, but with a toughness, sitting at the dining room table, in a well kept, but modest home, with windows that look out over the steep hillside favela, attends to her notebook. 
On the window there are half a dozen beautiful orchid plants. The rare Cataleya orchid. All around there are packed cartons, suitcases. Moving day is at hand. 
MOTHER Cat! Is your homework finished yet? 
CAT Working on it Mama. 
Her mother, taking time off from packing, comes over to Cat, and turns the page of the notebook to reveal the Lara Croft comic and it's copy. 
MOTHER You draw beautifully my love, but if you want to be something in life you have to study. 
CAT I am studying Mama. I want to be a super hero. 
Her mother turns the page back to the lessons. 
MOTHER Better to be a doctor. A lawyer. 
CAT Are we going to see Uncle Emilio? 
MOTHER I don't know. Just waiting to hear from your father. 
Cat looks up at a picture on the wall of the family. Cat, her mother, and her father. Her face carries a bit of worry. 
CLOSE ON 
DON LUIS I can't believe this. 
Mid 40'S, a gentleman, calm, courteous, impeccably dressed. 
PULL BACK TO 
EXT. DON LUIS'S GARDEN - DAY 
At a table, with bottle of liquor and two glasses, Don Luis sits opposite... 
FABIO Why not? 
Cat's father. Off to the side, Don Luis's right hand man, MARCO, stands like any right hand, unobtrusive. 
DON LUIS Because I love you Fabio. Like a brother. 
FABIO And I love you Don Luis. Like a brother. 
He turns to Marco. 
DON LUIS Can you believe this guy Marco? We started when we were little...how old were we Fabio? 
FABIO Ten. 
DON LUIS Ten year old bastards stealing apples from the carts in the market. After all we've been through. And now we're on top, he wants to leave... 
FABIO Luis, I'm going to be honest with you. You remember I had that operation? 
DON LUIS That was last year. 
FABIO Since then, I'm not a hundred percent. And you can't do this thing if you're not a hundred percent. I'm tired. 
DON LUIS So you'll take a rest. 
FABIO You know how many times we should have been dead? 
DON LUIS I don't even want to count. 
FABIO Neither do I. But you gotta think. How lucky we are to still be alive. 
DON LUIS Yeah. That's right. We're alive. And what about the future of this thing we built? 
FABIO It's yours. It's not my thing any more. 
DON LUIS I'm not going to talk you out of it, am I cabron? 
FABIO I'll always be there for you Luis. Just pick up the phone, I'm there. 
DON LUIS I'm gonna hold you to that. You bastard. (EMOTIONAL) I'm going to miss you. 
FABIO And I'm going to miss you. 
DON LUIS OK. Enough of this sentimental bullshit. Next we'll be crying like two old women. Come on! One last drink, huh? 
He pours the liquor into the glasses. 
DON LUIS To the future. 
They tap glasses. 
EXT. CAT'S HOME - DAY 
The man in the SUV is on the phone. 
MAN They said he's not home yet. 
He listens. 
MAN OK. OK. 
He hangs up. Puts his phone back in his pocket. Walks up to Fabio's men. 
MAN Change of plans. 
He pulls out his gun, shoots them point blank. 
INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY 
As they are exiting the house through a rear door, the shots ring out. They see another black SUV rushing up the street. 
FABIO Back! 
He pushes his family back inside. Fabio runs to the window. Sees his men on the losing end of a gun battle. As the men fall, and others run up the stairs firing as they retreat toward the front door... 
FABIO Too late. Get ready! 
The Mother drops the suitcases and runs to the rear room. Fabio comes over to the unnaturally calm Cat. 
FABIO I love you very much. 
CAT I love you too Papa. 
CLOSE ON FABIO'S HAND 
Reaches under the table where Cat is sitting, takes a gun strapped there. Next to the gun is a big knife. 
And then footsteps, coming fast outside, draw his attention. 
FABIO Alicia! 
His wife runs into the room toting two big assed assault rifles. She tosses one to Fabio. Both of them take up shooter's positions facing the door. 
ANGLE ON CAT 
Sitting at the table, very still. Watching. 
ANGLE ON HER MOTHER AND FATHER 
Facing the front door, hands gripping their assault rifles, sweat dripping down their faces, chests heaving, waiting, waiting, to blow anyone who comes through the door to kingdom come. 
But they never get the chance because... 
BBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKK!!!!!!!! 
Machine gun fire shatters the windows on both sides of the room, tearing into their bodies before they even get one shot off. Tearing the orchid plants there to shred. 
Cat watches in mute disbelief, shocked, as her parents bodies are riddled with heavy caliber rounds making them twitch and dance like marionettes on wires. Their blood splattering across the room, across her. 
And then... 
Silence. Silence so complete it is deafening in it's absence of any sound. Cat just sits in her chair. 
And then the door bursts open and four gunmen storm into the room, their assault weapons trained on the only living thing in the room. 
Cat. Marco enters. 
MARCO You in the kitchen. You, the bedroom. You, the back. 
The gunmen scatter. Marco has his inquisitive eye on Cat, who does not drop her eyes, impossible to read. 
One of the GUNMAN strides over to Cat, jams a gun to her head. Cat does not move a muscle. Does not blink. 
ANGLE ON MARCO 
Examines the frame Fabio dug the chip out of. 
ANGLE ON THE GUNMAN WITH THE GUN TO CAT'S HEAD 
He chambers a round, is about to pull the trigger... 
MARCO Hey! What are you doing? 
As the other gunmen begin to tear the house apart, looking for something, Marco strides over to Cat. The frame in his hand. 
GUNMAN Don Luis said kill everyone. 
MARCO He also said no names. 
GUNMAN She won't remember. 
He is about to pull the trigger. 
MARCO HEY! 
The gunman stops. 
MARCO She's a kid. 
GUNMAN So what? 
MARCO What do you mean so what? You take a kid, teach them, they have value. 
The gunman takes his gun, lifts Cat's lip, looks at her teeth. 
GUNMAN I couldn't even get ten bucks for her in the street. 
The gunman is about to pull the trigger again. 
And she drops... 
Six feet down, onto a ledge, that is just beneath the window. She flattens against the wall, holding onto the medal of her father. 
ON THE BATHROOM 
One of the gunman comes to the window, cannot fit through, looks out, does not see anybody across, then hears something beneath him, looks down, sees the tip of a shoe below. Puts his gun out the window, points it down, and.... 
BBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKKK!!!!!! 
Lets loose with a barrage from his weapon. 
ON CAT 
She watches as the bullets split the cement all around her feet. Coming inches from ripping into them. And then the barrage stops. 
ON THE GUNMAN 
His clip runs out. And as he fumbles to slam another one in... 
ON CAT 
She hears the pause. Looks out over the sprawl of houses that stretch up and down the steep hillsides of the favela. She looks down at her open palm at the small chip her father gave her. Pops the chip in her mouth, swallows, leaps over the small divide between her house and the next roof, and takes off running. 
ON THE GUNMAN 
Gets the clip to fit, sees Cat heading off across the roof, out in the open, exposed, vulnerable. He lifts his gun to shoot, when the gun muzzle is slammed up, peppers the ceiling with bullets. The gunman turns to Marco, holding his bloody rag wrapped hand. 
MARCO We need her alive! 
EXT. FAVELA - DAY 
Cat leaps from one rooftop to another, shinnies down a drain pipe onto another roof. 
ANGLE ON THE GUNMEN 
Jumping down from the window of Cat's home, start to sprint across the roof in hot pursuit. 
ON CAT 
She drops down to another roof, this one filled with a vegetable patch, where an old man is gardening. 
EXT. FAVELA - DAY 
Marco exits Cat's house, wrapping his bloody hand tightly with a piece of his shirt. 
MARCO Go! Go! 
He orders four more gunmen who have just zoomed up on motorcycles. The souped up rice rockets take off in four different directions. 
ON CAT 
As she comes off the last rooftop, down into a small alley. She sprints across to a small door. She kicks at the door, which gives way and enters... 
AN OPEN COURTYARD 
Where a half dozen women are doing laundry by an open tap. They look up to the sight of this little girl in the blood splattered school uniform, do not say a word. And neither does Cat. She just runs through to a small gate on the far side of the courtyard, opens it, and disappears. One of the women casually hangs one of her wet sheets over the gate, hiding it. 
ON THE GUNMEN 
They crash through the vegetable garden. The old man deftly kicks a rake leaning against the wall. It falls in between the rows of tomato vines. 
When the gunmen sprint through, the first one trips over the rake, goes crashing through the vines, which causes the two men behind him to also trip and fall. The fourth man hurdles his fallen cohorts, bounds over the roof. 
And the fifth man, looks at the old man. Knows what he has done. Shoots him dead before jumping off the roof. 
ON CAT 
She races down a steep hill in the crowded favela streets. 
ON THE GUNMEN 
They enter the laundry yard. The women don't even look up. The gunmen look around, just see laundry hanging from the fence, do not see the hidden door. Race back out. 
ON CAT 
She runs down a steep alley, filled with people sitting outside their homes, chatting, playing dominoes. 
At the end of the alley, two motorcycles appear. The riders see Cat, as she sees them. They turn their bikes into the alley... 
VRROOOM! 
And bear down on Cat. 
Cat sprints back up the hill. She goes to escape into one of the open doors, but she finds that one after another the doors have closed shut, the people fled inside. 
The bikes eat up the hill. Cat's legs are no match for them. It seems she will be caught any second. She ducks down a street where laundry is hung on a concealed metal pipe running the length of the alley. As Cat ducks through the sheets the gunmen gun their bikes right towards her, tear through the sheets... 
AND THE CONCEALED METAL PIPE CATCHES THEM ACROSS THEIR THROATS. 
ON CAT 
She looks back, to the dead gunmen, disappears over the hill. 
AND JUST AS SHE DOES... 
Marco, in an open top jeep, with three of his gunmen ON BOARD, comes rolling up the road. He sees Cat. 
MARCO There! 
The jeep screeches around. Cat dashes down an alley. 
ON CAT 
As she runs up the alley with it's open sewers running on either side. 
ON MARCO 
As his jeep speeds right for her. 
ON CAT 
As she runs, her eyes go to the right, and it becomes apparent she knows exactly what she is doing. She has a plan. And she executes it. Suddenly, she leaps for the curb and... 
A SEWER GRATE. 
ON MARCO 
Sees Cat dive to the curb. 
MARCO No! 
ON CAT 
As she wriggles her skinny little body down the grate, with barely enough room to squeeze in. But in she does squeeze. 
ON MARCO 
In total disbelief, watching her disappear down the narrow slit in the curb. 
Both jeeps pull up. The men jump out. Marco flattens to the street, peers into the grate, sees Cat staring up at him. 
Marco takes his gun out. Jams it in the grate... 
BAMBAMBAMBAMBAM!!!! 
Empties his clip into the dark. When he runs out of ammo, he peers down again. 
Cat is gone. The gunmen run to the next sewer grate fire into that one. Marco looks down, no Cat. 
MARCO Get down there! 
The gunmen rip the grate out, jump down the hole. 
INT. SEWERS - DAY 
The gunmen, following the beams of their flashlights, go tramping through the muck of the sewers, trying to find Cat. The only living things they find are rats, scurrying across their feet. 
GUNMAN (ON PHONE) We lost her! 
ON MARCO 
MARCO FUCK! FUCK! 
He kicks every car in the street in frustration. 
INT. SEWERS - DAY 
The gunmen wait in the sewer, waiting. 
MARCO V.O. Come back out. 
The gunmen retreat back the way they came. They do not see someone watching them go. 
ANGLE ON 
A small crevice in the sewer wall. Cat has squeezed herself into the crack, almost invisible. 
EXT. STREET - SUNSET 
Cars and trucks rumble along a busy thoroughfare. 
CLOSE ON A SEWER GRATE CUT INTO THE SIDE OF THE CURB 
A hand emerges. And then, Cat pulls herself out, into the street. 
PULL BACK TO CAT RISING 
She stands at the edge of the busy thoroughfare, and looks around. She is in the heart of the city. Where tall office buildings, compete with graceful, classical mansions. In the distance, she sees the hillsides, covered with the twinkling lights of the favelas, two miles, and a world away. 
EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - NIGHT 
Two Marines stand guard. Looking straight ahead. 
VOICE Excuse me... 
The Marine looks down to Cat. Bedraggled, covered in soot and blood and shit. Holding out the card her father gave her. 
CLOSE ON THE FACE OF A MIDDLE AGED AMERICAN 
PULL BACK TO 
INT. EMBASSY OFFICE - NIGHT 
The American looks at the card Cat gave to the Marine, hands it to another American. 
AMERICAN 1 And you say you have something for us? 
He turns to Cat, who nods yes. 
AMERICAN 1 May I see it? 
Cat takes a beat. Puts her fingers down her throat. And throws up all over the man's desk. 
AMERICAN 1 Oh jeez... 
Cat reaches into the goop on the desk and comes up with the chip. She hands it over to the man behind the desk, who takes a handkerchief out and takes it from her, gingerly. He looks at the chip, looks at Cat. 
AMERICAN 1 (REPULSED) Thank you. 
CLOSE ON A COMPUTER SCREEN 
Facts, figures, names, dates, a wealth of information scrolls down. 
PULL BACK TO THE TWO AMERICANS LOOKING AT EACH OTHER 
Cat is sitting watching the street, when a pair of legs appear in front of her. Cat looks up to the man who disappeared. 
MAN Come with me. 
He turns abruptly, heads back up the alley. 
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
Cat follows the man through a darkened alley. At intervals, on either side, dangerous looking men, armed to the teeth, stand in the shadows. The man opens a door, beckons Cat to enter. 
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
Cat follows the man as he moves down a long hallway. Cat looks into the rooms on either side of the hall as she walks along. 
In one room, opening out to a trucking bay, TV sets are being unloaded into a big warehouse full of stolen merchandise. 
In another room, guns are being serviced. Lots of guns, hand guns, assault rifles. Big artillery. 
MAN Hey! 
Cat's attention is drawn away from the room with the guns, to the Man holding a door open for her at the very end of the hall. 
INT. OFFICE - NIGHT 
Cat enters an office with three women working on computers. Looks like any other business office. At the sight of Cat, the women get up and exit, closing the door behind them. Cat is left alone. 
She looks around the office, when the sound of a door opening behind her. She turns to Emilio. Who approaches her cautiously, scrutinizing her. 
EMILIO Cataleya? 
Now it is Cat who hesitates. 
CAT Uncle Emilio? 
Emilio covers his mouth, seems rocked. 
EMILIO Madonna! I thought you were dead! 
He crosses himself. 
EMILIO I thought you were all... 
Cat stands stock still. Emilio takes her up in his arms, lifts her, crushes her to his chest. Cat remains suspended, emotionless for a moment. And then, for the first time emotion, real emotion, washes across her face. Her lower lip begins to tremble. Tears well up in her eyes. She bursts into tears. 
EMILIO You're safe now. 
All the emotion, the fear, the anger that she has kept locked away deep inside, rushes to the surface in one massive wave. 
EMILIO You're safe. 
EXT. CHICAGO - MORNING 
The sun peeks over the horizon, spreading the fog infused light coming off Lake Michigan across the sleeping city as it ascends in the sky. 
CLOSE ON 
One beam of sunlight slips through the narrow crack between a window and the shade covering it. 
CLOSE ON 
The ray of sunlight washes across Cat's sleeping face. She wakes slowly. Her eyes open after a long sleep. For a moment she does not remember where she is. 
PULL BACK TO 
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING 
Cat looks around the clean, orderly bedroom as she gathers her thoughts. Her eyes move around the room. It is a boy's room. 
With models of soldiers, futuristic warriors, a big poster of Al Pacino as Tony Montana in SCARFACE. A poster with every imaginable type of assault rifle. 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
Emilio sits reading the financial section of the morning paper over what seems to be the remains of a very hearty breakfast. An elderly woman, grandmotherly, fills his coffee cup. 
EMILIO Gracias mama. 
A noise turns both of them to the doorway and Cat. 
EMILIO Good morning. 
MAMA Buenos diaz Cara. Come. Sit. I'll make you some eggs. 
Mama caresses her face, her eyes glisten with a grandmother's love. Kisses her on the forehead, lovingly, whispers into her ear. 
MAMA You have your mother's beautiful eyes. Don't be scared. This is your home. 
Slowly, hesitantly, Cat makes her way across the kitchen to the table, where she sits opposite Emilio, tentative. 
EMILIO When was the last time you slept? 
CAT I don't know. A long time ago. 
EMILIO Well good. A growing body needs sleep. When I was your age I would sleep half the day. I don't know if it helped with the growing, but I was well rested for whatever came after. 
CAT Whose room is that? 
EMILIO My son. Your cousin. 
CAT Where is he? 
EMILIO He's dead. 
His voice holds anger, not sadness. 
CAT Killed? 
EMILIO Yes. 
The sergeant at the desk hears the ventilation system go off. 
SERGEANT Hey Doyle! 
He calls to one of the other cops on duty. 
SERGEANT Go take a look at the breaker on the ventilation system, will ya? 
Doyle moves off. 
INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT 
Cat watches the blades of the vent fan slow. When they have completely stopped she starts to move herself through the very narrow space between the now stilled blades, feet first. 
INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT 
Doyle enters the room, opens the electrical panel. The spoon, the weight, the spring, and the wire, fall to the floor. Doyle looks at them curiously for a moment. 
INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT 
Cat is half way through the fan blades. 
INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT 
Doyle looks at the switches, going down the printed list on the door, trying to locate the right one. 
INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT 
Cat is almost through. 
INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT 
Doyle finds the switch that corresponds to the ventilation system. 
INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT 
Cat's neck passes through the fan blades. Slow going. 
INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT 
Doyle hits the switch for the ventilation system. 
INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT 
Cat is just through, when the blades start moving, brush against her forehead, as she makes it to the other side with no time, and no room to spare. 
INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT 
Cat comes to a vent, looks down, begins to loosen the vent screws. 
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Cat drops down into a bathroom. Looks at her watch. Sits down, waiting. 
INT. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - NIGHT 
Rizzo is asleep in his cell. The Marshal on duty finishes his coffee. Looks at Rizzo. 
Then walks over to the door at the end of the wall. He hits a buzzer on the wall. 
INT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT 
The cop manning the bank of monitors, wakes up, sees the Marshal in the monitor. 
MARSHAL (OVER INTERCOM) Gotta pee. 
The monitor hits a button. 
INT. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - NIGHT 
The door buzzes open. The Marshal passes through. 
INT. HALL - NIGHT 
The Marshal pushes the bathroom door open. Enters. 
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
The Marshal finishes peeing, zips himself up. Turns. Right into a devastating reverse wheel kick. 
INT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT 
The cop on duty hears a buzz, looks up to the bank of monitors, and sees the Marshal standing at the door. Thinking nothing of it, he hits the buzzer. 
INT. HALL - NIGHT 
Cat, propping the unconscious Marshal up, hides behind him. As the door buzzes, she maneuvers the body around, pushes through. On the other side, she drops the body, and takes his gun. 
INT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT 
On the monitor it looks like the Marshal is passing through. 
INT. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - NIGHT 
Rizzo is half asleep, when the barrel of a gun taps him on the head. He opens his eyes slowly to... 
CAT Unbutton your shirt. 
RIZZO What...? 
CAT Now. 
Rizzo looks over to where the Marshal is passed out cold on the floor. He does as he is told. 
RIZZO Who the hell are you? 
CAT Not room service. 
Clinging to the wall like a gekko. The dun colored wall blending with her dun colored suit. How is she doing this? 
CLOSE ON CAT'S SHOES 
The blades fitted into the seam between the bricks. Her fingertips clinging to the small lip on the bottom of the roof's edge. 
ABOVE HER 
The cops look around the roof. 
ON CAT 
She holds there listening to the noise above. Hears noise below, looks down to see... 
EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Cops searching the alley below. 
ON CAT 
Hanging to the edge of the building. Listening, watching. 
EXT. ROOF OF POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
The cops, finding nothing, head back out the door. A moment later... 
CLOSE ON THE ROOF LEDGE 
Cat's hand reaches up. 
ON CAT 
When one hand has a firm grasp on the roof ledge, she lets go with the other hand and grasps the ledge, extracts the blades from the brick seams, and swings herself up on the roof. As her shoes dislodge, some mortar comes loose and falls below. 
ON THE COPS BELOW 
The crumbling mortar falls on the head of one cop, he looks down, sees the crumbly gravel, looks up, sees nothing. 
EXT. ROOF OF POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Cat lands on the roof, lays still. 
ON THE COP BELOW 
He examines the gravel, looks up again. And then moves on. 
EXT. ROOF OF POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS 
Cat pries the vent cover off, slips in.

INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT 
The cops open the door to the women's cell block. 
INT. CELL - NIGHT 
Cat runs. Begins to pull at her leotard. 
INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT 
The cops look at the women's cells, heading right toward Cat's. As they reach Cat's, the same cop who did the rounds at the beginning of the night looks into her cell. Cat is laying on her side, away from them, dead asleep, in the same position she was when the cop first checked on her. The cops pause for a moment, then move on. 
CLOSE ON CAT 
Her eyes are wide open. She listens for the outer door closing, and then she breathes out, relieved. 
EXT. CITY MORGUE - NIGHT 
An ambulance pulls up, along with the Marshal contingent in their SUV's. The Marshal's spill out of the SUV's as a gurney with a corpse is wheeled into the morgue. 
INT. MORGUE - NIGHT 
As the Marshal's stand around, the Police Coroner begins to unbutton the shirt of Rizzo the corpse. 
CORONER What the fuck? 
HIS POV 
On Rizzo's chest the word TRAITOR is written in thick black letters. And above them, a drawing of the Cataleya orchid. The Marshal's knows what this is. 
MARSHAL Holy shit! Call Ross. 
EXT. SMALL AIRPORT - MORNING 
The door of a small jet opens and MARCUS ROSS, 48, a keen eyed, no nonsense all business FBI agent, followed by a team of similarly focused men and women, exits down the stairs to... 
MARSHAL Agent Ross? 
ROSS Where is he? 
MARSHAL At the hospital. 
Cat dressed in jeans, a scuffed leather jacket, a baseball cap, with the brim pulled low over her eyes, with her pony tail sticking out of the back, the knap sack on her shoulder, waits on line to board the bus. She keeps her back to the security camera, has her phone to her ear. A number is ringing. 
INT. EMILIO'S HOUSE - DAY 
Emilio, fifteen years older, is watching a soccer game, picks up the phone. In the kitchen, Mama is cooking. 
EMILIO Are we good? 
INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO 
Cat moves up the line to board the bus. 
CAT We're good. 
EMILIO When are you back? 
CAT Day after. 
EMILIO I have something. 
CAT The morning after OK? 
EMILIO Can't wait to see you Cara. 
CAT Say hello to Mama. 
He looks over to Mama at the stove, who waves over her shoulder. 
EMILIO Mama says hello back. 
He hangs up, goes back to his game. 
INT. BUS STATION - DAY 
Cat boards the bus. The doors close behind her. 
As the camera ZOOMS up, and the bus pulls out onto the road... 
ROSS V.O. See? 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
Ross is pointing up at the camera Cat tilted. 
ROSS He tilted the camera just enough so the angle would catch the guard, not who was holding him. 
He turns to his team. 
ROSS Twenty two murders in four years all with the same M.O. The word, the flower. He's sending a message, for sure. And I'm beginning to think it's not to us. 
AGENT 1 But we're the only ones with the information. 
ROSS And we're not getting anywhere with it, are we? 
No one on the team can dispute this. It occurs to Ross... 
ROSS If the message is not for us, let's make sure the one it's intended for gets it. I want you to put it out to the press. Splash it across every newspaper, every magazine. National. I want eyeballs on it coast to coast. Monitor it. Let's see if anything comes back. 
EXT. UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL NEW ORLEANS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 
A Lincoln town car comes down the leafy, quiet street of well kept homes. Stops at a gate guarded by two men, who wave him through. 
EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY 
The car ends up in front of a very impressive house, which sits at the end of a long driveway. Toward the era of the walled property, a garage, and a guest house. MR. RICHARD, in a suit and tie, looking like a proper mid level government official, or a lawyer, exits, newspaper in hand. As he approaches the front door, Richard looks over to see two more guards, off to the side. He nods to them, knows them. They nod back. 
Richard approaches the front door, knocks. While he is waiting, he looks down at the paper. 
The door opens. 
MARCO Mr. Richard... 
Richard looks up to a fifteen year older Marco. 
MARCO Been a long time. 
RICHARD Yes it has Marco. How's the hand? 
Marco holds up his scarred hand. 
MARCO Only hurts when it's humid. 
RICHARD Should've let us relocate you to Arizona instead of New Orleans. 
MARCO The Boss likes it humid. 
RICHARD There it is then. 
MARCO He's waiting for you. 
Richard enters. The door closes. 
INT. SALON - DAY 
Don Luis stares out a bay window, drink in hand. 
RICHARD Hello Luis. 
Don Luis turns. 
DON LUIS Hello Mr. Richard. 
RICHARD I brought you the morning paper. 
He holds the paper up. 
CLOSE ON A PICTURE OF DEAD RIZZO ON THE FRONT PAGE. 
ROSS The Gemini cartel. Their crimes are self explanatory, if you can read. Now I know some of you are thinking whoever is doing this makes less work for mother. And since there's no collateral damage, why are we wasting valuable manpower and resources on the case? And since until now, there has never been a clue to go on, why go on? But with this last killing... 
He holds up a stack of folders from his desk. 
ROSS We have one. As we go to the video tape. 
He hits a button and the video replay of Cat walking the unconscious guard through the door. 
ROSS We can't see the assassin, but we can see... 
He freezes the tape. Points to the time mark on the tape. 
ROSS The time. 2 AM. Which means our perp was in the station at...I don't have to spell it out for you. 
He begins to hand the folders out. 
ROSS These are the names, phone numbers and addresses of everyone with a pulse who entered that police station before two AM. Cops, criminals, clerks, janitors. Everyone. One of them is our target. I want each of you to locate the ten people in the folder you've been given. I want a complete dossier on every one of them for the last ten years of their lives. Run down every lead. Check out every story. Our killer is out there. And we're going to find him. Before he kills again. 
THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
As an elevator train rumbles by below... 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
An elevator train rumbles by above. 
PAN DOWN TO 
A car parking. And DANNY DELANEY, preoccupied, a pleasant, easy going, good looker at 28, closes the door, and walks to the entrance of his low slung apartment building. He enters. 
INT. DANNY'S HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Danny puts his key in the door, finds that it is unlocked. He pauses, then enters. 
INT. DANNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Danny enters his darkened apartment. Goes to turn on the switch... 
VOICE Don't move. 
Danny's hand freezes. He stands very still. 
VOICE Take off your shirt. 
DANNY Do I have to? 
VOICE Now. 
Danny complies. 
VOICE Turn around. 
He does. To darkness. And then, a match is struck, a candle is lit. Standing before him, in garters, thigh highs, a very sexy bra, and fuck me pumps is... 
CAT Hello Danny. 
DANNY Hello Jennifer. 
Cat closes to an inch of him. 
DANNY You should have called. 
CAT Why? 
DANNY I could have been out. 
CAT I have a key. 
DANNY I could have been late. 
She begins to kiss him, lightly around the mouth. 
CAT I've got nowhere to go. 
DANNY It's just... 
CAT Just what? 
She keeps kissing him, lightly on the neck... 
DANNY You show up whenever you want to... 
CAT And then we have the most incredible sex. (BEAT) Ever. 
DANNY I know. I'm just saying... 
He fumbles for the words. 
DANNY Wouldn't you like to go to dinner sometime? 
She keeps nibbling. 
CAT Uh-uh. This taste good enough. 
DANNY Or a movie? 
Licking him. 
CAT No. They put me to sleep. 
DANNY So let's pop in a DVD and you can spend the night here? 
She stops. Looks him in the eye. 
CAT Would you like the key back? 
DANNY No. I just want to get...I don't know... 
ROSS OK. Let's try...organization... 
He types. Data comes up. And what he sees stuns him... 
A folder marked CIA: CONFIDENTAL. ACCESS DENIED. 
ROSS (FRUSTRATED) Fuck... 
OVER THE SOUND OF CHIMES... 
EXT. PEPE'S WAREHOUSE/HOME - DAY 
A ramshackle warehouse, it's windows streaked opaque with years of dust and grime, surrounded by a fence, and a weedy garden which is home to dozens of the most unique wind chimes of all sizes and shapes, made from scrap metal. And two of the biggest, most ferocious dogs on Earth, laying on their sides, asleep. 
The dog's ears perk up; hearing something we don't, a low growl begins to rumble deep in their throats. The gate to the garden begins to open, and like a shot the dogs are up, hurling themselves toward the opening gate, eyes flashing, barking loud enough to scare the dead back to life, fangs bared, ready to kill. 
And then they stop cold when they see who it is coming into their domain. 
REVERSE ON CAT 
Holding two very full shopping bags. 
CAT Hi guys. 
And the dogs jump all over her, licking her. 
CAT Hey! Hey! 
She pets them, plays with them. 
CAT OK. OK. Now sit. 
The dogs obey her in a heartbeat, sitting expectantly. Not making a sound. 
CAT Now let's see what good boys you can be. 
She reaches into one of the shopping bags, pulls out two roasts! 
CAT Top cut sirloin. 
Which she puts down on the ground. The dog's eyes go to the chunks of meat. 
CAT Nice, huh? 
The dogs can barely contain themselves. 
CAT Red, juicy, delicious. 
The dogs whimper in anticipation. 
CAT Stay. 
She picks up the shopping bags, and heads for the ramshackle warehouse. The dogs moan, but do not move, their eyes going from the meat to Cat. 
Cat reaches the door. Turns. Sees the dogs looking at her. 
CAT Good boys. (BEAT) Eat. 
The dogs pounce. Each one grabs a roast and tears into the meat with ferocious, pent up glee. Cat smiles at the sight, enters the warehouse. 
INT. PEPE'S WAREHOUSE/HOME - DAY 
The warehouse, is filled with piles of rusting scrap metal, the cannibalized carcasses of cars, trucks, shipping containers, welding equipment, hammers tongs, all sorts of tools. In the corner is one fully built truck, a big red monster with huge demolition fenders. 
This is home to OLD PEPE, an ancient, blind man, who is working away, building yet another set of oversized chimes out of scrap metal. 
PEPE Hola Cataleya. 
CAT Hola Pepe. I guess the boys gave me away. 
PEPE Anyone else? The barking would only have stopped when their screaming began. You spoil them. 
CAT I train them. 
PEPE If that's what you want to call it. 
Cat kisses Pepe, taps one of the chimes, it makes the most ethereal sound as one chime bangs against the other. She opens a cupboard in the makeshift kitchen area, and starts unpacking the groceries. 
PEPE Did you get the beans I like? 
CAT Of course. 
PEPE And the salsa Verde? 
CAT And the salsa Verde. 
PEPE Not the one in the short bottle. 
CAT The long one. 
PEPE I hate that other one, the chili they use sucks. Did you see your uncle? 
CAT Of course. 
She moves from the kitchen, walks across to the far wall. 
PEPE We're going to church for Easter. 
CAT As always. 
PEPE And you? 
CAT Not this year. 
Until she reaches a big discarded safe, taller than her, with an impregnable door. 
PEPE As always. You should, you know. 
INT. VILLA - NIGHT 
William is at the double doors to his massive bedroom suite, the girls are on the bed in the BG jumping around, in the skimpiest bra and panty sets, having a pillow fight. 
WILLIAM (to head of security) Bring extra security in for the night. 
HEAD SECURITY Yes sir. 
WILLIAM And make sure we're shut down tight. 
HEAD SECURITY Yes sir. Have a good night, sir. 
WILLIAM I intend to. 
The doors close, and lock. Wild shrieks come from inside. 
EXT. VILLA - EVENING 
A van rolls up to the main gate, half a dozen security men exit. 
HEAD SECURITY There are already guys in the garden and guys out back. I want you three upstairs, two on the roof. You three downstairs. Follow me. 
As they all enter the villa, the CAMERA lingers on the van. A figure dressed in black rolls out from under the carriage as it pulls away and disappears into the bushes. 
QUICK TIME CUTS 
Two guards stand outside the bedroom door. Two guards are on the stairs. Three guards in the salon. Three more in the garden outside. 
INT. VILLA - NIGHT 
The Head of Security goes around the villa checking that all the doors and windows are secure. His men are posted outside the door to the bedroom, on the stairs, in the salon. He closes lights as he goes. 
He walks across the aquarium floor in the foyer to the front door, closes the lights, so that only the glow from the aquarium lights illuminate the dark. And he exits, closing the door behind him, turning the lock. 
CLOSE ON THE AQUARIUM 
The sharks gliding back and forth. And then, a figure in a black wet suit, fins and a mask, with a small back back, comes gliding into through the sharks. Who just go about their business. The figure stops at the edge of the glass floor, takes something out of the back pack and very skillfully cuts a small hole in one of the glass panels that makes up the floor. 
The diver lifts out of the aquarium, pulls back the wet suit. It is Cat. 
Cat opens the backpack, removes a silencer fitted pistol. 
CLOSE ON THE BEDROOM DOORS OPENING 
Cat enters, silent, closes the door, approaches the bed where William is asleep sandwiched between the three passed out girls. Empty champagne bottles and glasses are strewn about. 
Cat stares down at the scene, points her gun at William. One of the girls rolls over onto William, ruining her shot. She hesitates. 
CLOSE ON WILLIAM'S FACE 
As sits up suddenly, startled from sleep. No one is in the room. He looks around, and notices the bedroom door ajar. He is more awake now, sees the Nymphettes sleeping soundly. He rises, dressed in a silk sleeping robe. He feels something on his chest, goes over to the mirror, opens his gown and sees, painted on his chest: In red lipstick, the word THIEF, and a drawing of a Cataleya orchid. Panic starts to set in. 
WILLIAM Hello? 
No answer. 
William tip toes to the ajar door. He peeks out and sees two guards with bullets through their foreheads, blood leaked out across the white marble floor. Really panicked, he flattens himself against the inside of the door, his breath coming in gasps. 
INT. VILLA - NIGHT 
William, holding the two guns of the dead guards in front of him, makes his way down stairs, past two more dead guards. Growing more and more nervous by the moment, he tries a light switch on the wall, nothing. 
The only light comes from the ambient glow of the aquarium below. He reaches the bottom of the stairs. 
WILLIAM Anybody? 
No answer. He crosses the aquarium floor, and when he is right in the middle... 
CAT Stop right there. 
Cat comes out of the dark. In her hand, a silencer fitted pistol. 
WILLIAM Who are you? 
CAT Doesn't matter who I am. 
He pulls the trigger on his gun. Click, click, click. He tries the other one. Again click click click. 
WILLIAM What do you want? 
CAT I want you exactly where you are. 
And then, without warning, she puts a bullet in both his knees. 
WILLIAM ARRRGGGHHHH! 
He falls to the floor. The blood starts to seep out onto the glass. The sharks swim back and forth. 
WILLIAM Whatever they paid you, I'll double it! 
CAT You know the thing about sharks. You can swim with them all day and they will just ignore you, but put one drop of blood in the water and they become your biggest admirers. 
WILLIAM Please. I'll give you anything you want. Don't kill me! 
CAT I'm not going to kill you. (BEAT) They are. 
She fires three shots into the glass square he is kneeling on. The glass shatters. William falls into the water. Grabs onto the squares on either side and props himself up. His blood runs down into the clear water. Cat turns and walks toward the door. 
WILLIAM Please! Please! 
He struggles frantically to pull himself out. Cat exits. And then the sharks hit. WHAM! And hit. And hit. And hit. 
WILLIAM Please! Help! Help! 
He is violently dragged under. 
CLOSE ON 
ROSS ...a woman. 
Cannot believe it. 
EXT. MIAMI - LITTLE COLOMBIA - DAY 
Marco and his thugs enter a small social club/bar. 
INT. SOCIAL CLUB - DAY 
A dimly lit place, where strangers are few and suspicious looks from the rough men playing pool at the back to able and lining the bar are par for the course. 
EDUARDO, a small time hood, lines up a shot with a pool cue, when a hand comes down on the ball he is about to shoot. He looks up to... 
MARCO Hello Eduardo, que pasa? 
EDUARDO I have fifty bucks on this shot. That's what's que pasa. 
MARCO (SMILING) Hey sorry. Come on. 
He opens his arms. They hug. Eduardo is friendly, but there is a hesitation, a tension in the air. As they break marco takes a roll of cash out. 
MARCO Here. For you. 
He goes to hand it to Eduardo. 
EDUARDO For what? 
MARCO First for fucking up your shot. Second, for an address. You remember Fabio? The Cataleya Killer? 
EDUARDO It's a long time. My memory... 
MARCO You went to school with his brother in law. What was his name? Emilio? 
EDUARDO Like I said...my memory... 
Now the men at the bar are starting to take notice. 
MARCO I have a problem. And we think Fabio's kid is behind it. 
Eduardo takes the roll of bills and puts it in Marco's shirt pocket. 
EDUARDO Look Marco. I gotta be honest with you. Everyone knows you guys were playing a double game, and when the shit went down, you were the only ones who got out of it clean. 
The men at the bar are now edging closer. One of them has a shot gun resting along his leg, inconspicuous, and conspicuous at the same time. 
MARCO So you do have a memory. 
EDUARDO Yeah. For rats. Now get the fuck out, and let me take my shot. 
MARCO OK... 
Marco looks at Eduardo, who glares at him. Eduardo goes to line up his shot. The tension in the room is thicker by the moment. As Eduardo is about to hit the ball, Marco grabs his hair and slams his forehead into the cue ball. At the same moment, Marco's two thugs whip out their guns and blast away. The shotgun wielding man, raises his gun, and as he is killed by Marco, his blast takes out one of Marco's thugs. 
In an instant it is over. Everyone is dead, except Marco, one of his thugs, and the dazed Eduardo. Marco notices his ear is bleeding, touches it, it pisses him off that blood has soiled his white shirt. 
MARCO Fuck... 
Pissed, Marco yanks Eduardo up from the floor and slams him onto the pool table. Sticks his gun in his face. 
MARCO You don't tell me what I want to know by the count of three, you scum sucking lowlife prick, your memory will be permanently disabled. One...two... 
A buzzer sounds... 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Danny opens the door to his building. 
INT. DANNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Danny enters to a candle lit room and... 
CAT I brought you something. 
She is in a very sexy lingerie top. Her hands are behind her back. 
DANNY That's real progress. Let's see. 
She takes her hands out from behind her back, presents him with a cute little stuffed alligator. 
DANNY Wow! Just what I always wanted. 
CAT You're making fun. 
DANNY No. No. I mean, a gift from you. Something to show me you're thinking of me as more than your boy toy. 
CAT Well, there's that too. 
She starts to peel off the lingerie. 
DANNY Wait. 
She stops. 
CAT You don't want me? 
DANNY Of course I do. But can't we talk a little first? 
CAT What would you like to talk about? 
DANNY Oh, I don't know. Nothing. Anything. 
CAT You really want to do this? 
DANNY Yes, I do. 
CAT (AMUSED) OK. 
Cat jumps out of bed, starts to dress quickly. 
DANNY Wait... 
CAT I shouldn't have done this. 
Pulls on her jeans. 
DANNY Done what? 
CAT Any of it. 
DANNY Why? 
CAT Because. 
DANNY Can we talk about it? 
Pulls on her top. 
CAT We already talked. I'm late. 
Slips into her shoes. Does not answer. 
DANNY I made breakfast. 
CAT I don't like eggs. 
As she heads for the door, she turns. 
CAT Now you know something else about me. 
And with a small smile, she is gone. 
INT. HALL - MORNING 
Outside Danny's door, Cat crosses to the elevator, waits for it to come. As she does, she fixes her clothes a bit, her eyes on Danny's door. 
CAT (TO HERSELF) Don't come out. Please. Don't. 
The door doesn't open. The elevator arrives. She takes a deep breath, enters. The door closes. 
EXT. PAINT SUPPLY STORE - DAY 
Cat comes running in. 
INT. PAINT SUPPLY STORE - DAY 
Cat hurries down the aisle, keeping an eye on the security camera. Making sure she stays on the far side, out of it's range. She stops in the middle of the aisle, starts to examine paint brushes. 
CAT Sorry I'm late. 
ANGLE ON EMILIO 
Standing next to her, looking at a color chart, hidden from the security camera, as is she. He is pissed. He has the newspaper with Woogard's picture. He throws the paper in her face. Cat is taken aback by a display of anger she has never seen in this man before. 
EMILIO You said you would stop the writing! 
Then he shoves an article cut from a paper in her face. 
EMILIO Read this! 
As she starts... 
EMILIO Seven people slaughtered in a Miami bar. I knew one of them. Years ago, in school. 
CAT So what? 
EMILIO I don't like it. This is getting too close. 
CAT Tio. Could be anyone. You're seeing things that aren't there. 
EMILIO And you are so blinded by your need for revenge that you are not seeing things that are. The handwriting is on the wall Cara. Let me read it to you. This is over. I will no longer accept jobs. I will no longer solicit jobs. You are retired. 
CAT How many people did you kill in revenge for your boy's death? How many? And you're going to give me a lecture about revenge? 
EMILIO (CALM) Cara. It's time to get a life, before you run out of time. Here. 
He hands her an envelope. 
EMILIO Maybe this will help you understand what I am telling you. 
Emilio leaves first this time. Cat just stands there, her world rocked. She opens the envelope, takes out a photograph, looks at it. 
CLOSE ON A PHOTO OF CAT WITH HER PARENTS 
Dressed for her first Communion. Everyone is smiling. She is holding a Cataleya orchid bouquet. 
ON CAT 
Her eyes well up. She can't hold it anymore. She begins to cry. 
VOICE Five six. Brown eyes, hazel really, dark hair, thick, shiny... 
EXT. CAFE - DAY 
Danny is sitting with his friend RYAN. 
DANNY Great body, killer smile. (BEAT) And I think about her all day long. 
RYAN Dude, you're in love. 
DANNY You're so smart. 
RYAN Seriously. This comes from the heart. OK? (BEAT) You're nuts. (BEAT) The girl comes over, strips down, rocks your world, gets dressed, asks for nothing. Leaves. The only thing she doesn't do is bring the pizza and beer. You are living my dream. And you want to go and fuck it up with love? 
DANNY I knew you were the perfect guy to talk about this with. 
AGENT 1 No ma'am everything is under control. We just need you to stay inside. May we have a look around? 
As the FBI enters... 
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Cat has finished setting her charges. She looks up at the ceiling, listens. 
INT. HALL - DAY 
Ross's man has finished setting the charges. He looks at Ross. The rest of the team fingers their weapons.

Cat waits, looking up. 
INT. HALL - DAY 
An FBI agent knocks on the door of the apartment she has just entered. 
INT. HALL - DAY

BOOM! 
INT. HALL - DAY 
Cat's door blows open, the SWAT flood in. 
INT. BATHROOM - DAY 
A perfect rectangle is blown in the wall, revealing utility pipes.

INT. CAT'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Ross barks into his walkie talkie. 
ROSS She's not here. Lock the building down! 
INT. BATHROOM - DAY 
Cat lets go. And drops. 
TRACK CAT AS SHE SLIDES AT A FANTASTIC SPEED DOWN THE UTILITY POLES 
INT. CAT'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Ross is looking at the bank of security monitors in Cat's cabinet, sees all his men, all over the place, inside the building, outside. 
ROSS Where the hell did she go? 
INT. SHAFT - DAY 
Cat lands on the floor, next to door. She unhooks herself from the pipes, and pushes out the door. Enters through to the... 
INT. GARAGE - DAY 
Cat looks around, listens, and then begins to make her way across the garage, using the parked cars as cover from the security cameras. 
INT. BUILDING - DAY 
Ross leads his men as they scour the building. 
ROSS No one in or out! Lock this place down! Anyone? 
EXT. BUILDING - DAY 
AGENT 1 Nothing here. 
INT. HALL - DAY 
AGENT 2 Nothing here. 
INT. GARAGE - DAY 
Cat reaches an open space where cars just cannot shield her. There are two security cameras covering it. Cat draws one of her silencers and shoots the lens out of one camera. 
INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY 
An agent is standing next to the building security guard, when one camera goes out. 
ROSS V.O. Anything? 
AGENT 1 Nothing...wait...one security camera down. 
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 
Ross pauses. 
INT. GARAGE - DAY 
Cat shoots the second camera. Heads across the open space, quickly. 
INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY 
Ross faces her. 
CAT Sit. 
She motions him into the chair behind him. 
ROSS Just so you know, all this? Being so smart? Covering all your bases? It's not going to matter. It's already over. The whole place is wired with web cams. 
His moment of triumph is short lived. Cat reaches on the side of the counter. Holds up six web cams, wires ripped out. 
CAT You mean these? 
Tosses the ripped out cams onto the table. 
CAT Talking about covering all your bases. Your chair is pressure wired. You move your ass one inch you don't have one anymore. 
Ross looks under the chair. Sure enough, there are several wires leading out of the bottom of the chair. He looks further to the where the wires attach to a small charge. She puts her gun down on the table. 
CAT I know what you're thinking. Maybe yes a bluff, maybe no. But you have to figure yes, given what you know about me. 
Ross does not move. 
CAT This wasn't what I had in mind for myself when I was a kid. I wanted to be on the other side of things. Like you. 
ROSS So what happened? 
CAT He did. 
She takes out an old picture of Don Luis, lifted from the internet. She takes out the picture of her parents and her as an eight year old. 
CAT This is the last time I was happy. (MORE) 
CAT (CONT'D) The next day they were dead. He killed them. 
ROSS And all this? All these clues...they weren't for us. They were for him. 
CAT I didn't know how else to find him. 
ROSS And you figured sooner or later we would make this public. 
CAT It took you a long time. 
ROSS You're very patient. 
CAT What else do I have to be? I have no one. I did. Until this morning. I had them. 
She takes out pictures of dead Mama, dead Emilio, dead Pepe. 
ROSS You sent him a message. He sent you one back. 
CAT And now I want to finish it. 
ROSS I can't help you. 
CAT Yes you can. He's protected by your government. 
ROSS By a part of the government I have no way of reaching. It's CIA. I don't know why. But there's no getting through it, under it, around it, believe me, I've tried. 
CAT You're going to have to try harder. 
She takes a photo album out, opens it. 
CAT I found this on your table inside. Your family, right? 
Begins to flip pages. 
CAT Brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews. Mother, father. Nice. 
Ross knows what is coming. 
CAT I know this sounds harsh. But until I get what I want, you'll go to a funeral a week. And you will begin to feel what I have felt all these years. 
She places the photo album in his lap. Puts his food in the microwave, starts it. Goes to exit. 
ROSS Wait... 
She stops. 
ROSS What about...? 
He points to the chair. 
CAT When your dinner's ready, the timer on it will have expired. Then you can get to work. 
And she is gone. Ross watches the timer on the microwave. When it beeps, he sits a moment longer. Hesitates to get up. Little by little, he moves himself off the chair, tentative. Afraid that any moment, BOOM! Until he makes the final move, stands just enough to clear the seat, waiting for the worst to happen. And when it doesn't, he breathes a sigh of relief. 
EXT. CIA OFFICE - DAY 
A non descript building. 
INT. RICHARD'S OFFICE - DAY 
Facing a large picture window... 
RICHARD You understand, I only agreed to this meeting out of professional courtesy. (MORE) 
RICHARD (CONT'D) The President wanting us to reach out to you folks on the domestic side, and all that pie in the sky crap. (BEAT) The truth is, I really can't help you at all. 
ROSS Can't or won't. 
RICHARD Same thing really. 
ROSS Look, let's put all our cards on the table here. I've met this woman. The killer. 
RICHARD (SKEPTICAL) Really? Where? 
ROSS My apartment. She trapped me. She told me if I did not get her this man. 
MARCO You will take up positions here... 
PULL BACK TO 
INT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY 
As Don Luis sips a cognac, staring out the big bay window onto the wide street beyond the garden. 
EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY 
The house sits prominent in the middle of a quiet neighborhood. 
INT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY 
Marco points to the floor plan, explaining to the dozen thugs gathered with their weapons... 
MARCO And here. And here. You must expect the unexpected. She is like mist under a door, like a mouse in the wall. She will never attack straight on. You will not see her, until it is too late. She is that invisible. 
ON DON LUIS as he sips his cognac. He sees a big red truck approaching in the distance up the road. As he watches, squinting, curious, the truck does an abrupt U turn. Marco drones on in the background... 
MARCO We would prefer she be taken alive. But with a bitch like this, if you get a kill shot you take it. 
...Don Luis watches, as a woman gets out of the truck. He cannot make out who it is, what with the fog and his vision... 
DON LUIS Marco? 
He sees the woman open the rear door of the truck, and pull something out. He takes his glasses out of his pocket, puts them on. Just in time to see... 
CAT SHOULDERING A LAWS SHOULDER ROCKET!!! 
DON LUIS MARCO! 
Marco turns. 
ANGLE ON CAT FIRING THE ROCKET 
ANGLE ON MARCO DON LUIS AND THE THUGS 
Seeing the rocket heading right for the salon. They all leap out of the way, just as the rocket comes crashing through the bay window. And blows the salon to smithereens. Cat reenters the truck, drives off fast. 
As the debris falls, and the dust and smoke rises, Marco helps Don Luis up. He is a little stunned. Through the gaping hole where the bay window was, they see the red truck driving off. 
MARCO You four! Get the armored Mercedes! We have to get Don Luis out of here! 
The four run off. 
MARCO Don Luis! This way! Everyone to their positions! 
As they all run out... 
INT. GARAGE - DAY 
The four thugs run into the garage, where there are several cars. And a big armored van. 
THUG OK! Everyone in! 
But just as they open the doors to the big Mercedes... 
THE RED TRUCK COMES RAMMING THROUGH, TAKES OUT THE WHOLE WALL OF THE GARAGE! DESTROYS THE MERCEDES. 
Cat leaps out of the truck, and before the four startled thugs know what has hit them, she puts three of them down with shots to the heart. 
The fourth runs out the back. 
EXT. GROUNDS - DAY 
The fourth thug runs for all he is worth, bleeding from his forehead, panicked. 
ANGLE ON CAT 
Calmly exiting the garage, she removes a set of throwing knives from a belt around her waist, taking a long minute to gauge the distance. When he has almost reached the safety of the house... 
ON THE THUG RUNNING 
ON CAT FLINGING THE KNIVES 
TRACK WITH THE KNIVES AND THEN... 
ON THE THUG 
He drops like dead lead, the two knives embedded in his back. 
ANGLE ON MARCO WITH DON LUIS 
Inside the house, seeing Cat through a window. 
ANGLE ON CAT 
Looking back at him. Pointing a finger at him. Before she disappears in to the drifting mists. 
ANGLE ON 
MARCO Don Luis! You hide here. 
He opens a secret door in the wall, revealing a small space. Barely big enough for a man. 
MARCO Wait for my call. Either she is dead, or we have her far enough away so you can make it to the garage. Take the van. The armor is so thick nothing short of an atomic bomb can penetrate it. 
DON LUIS Marco. Thank you. 
MARCO (TOUCHED) That's the first time you ever said that. 
DON LUIS Said what? 
MARCO Thank you. 
DON LUIS Don't get used to it. 
INT. CLOSET - DAY 
Don Luis is panicking. Yelling into the phone. 
DON LUIS Marco! Marco! 
INT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY 
Marco and the two thugs run into the small house. 
MARCO You two here! That door opens... 
He points to the door they just came through. 
MARCO ...kill anything that comes through. 
Marco runs into the bedroom. 
INT. BEDROOM - DAY 
Marco runs to the curtained windows, rips the curtains back, hoping to escape. And finds that the windows have metal hurricane shutters on them. With locks. Marco pulls out a set of keys, frantically tries fitting the keys to the locks. None of them work. 
MARCO Shit! 
He runs for the door again. Just as he has his hand on the knob, two shots ring out. 
MARCO Giorgio? 
Nothing. 
MARCO Tonino? 
No answer. He checks his gun, realizes he is out of ammo. He knows his time has come. He drops is gun, backs away from the door. Backs right up to the bed, and sits down. His phone rings. 
INT. CLOSET - DAY 
DON LUIS Marco! What the hell's going on??? 
INT. BEDROOM - DAY 
Marco just stares at the door. 
MARCO Hold on. 
There is a small sound outside the door. 
MARCO I will hold here! Run! Run! 
The door shatters as Cat kicks her way in. Marco pulls his trigger. Click! Click! Click! Marco is frozen. Just stares at Cat. Waiting for what is going to come. 
MARCO Do it! Do it you bitch! Isn't this the moment you've been waiting for? 
CAT Yes, it is. 
She empties her gun into him. 
EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY 
Gripped by fear, Don Luis runs for all he is worth across the fog shrouded garden until he reaches the garage. He yanks open the door, runs inside. 
INT. GARAGE - DAY 
Don Luis runs around Pepe's red truck and the crumbled Mercedes, jumps in the armored van. 
INT. ARMORED VAN - DAY 
Don Luis fumbles with the keys, grinds the ignition in his desperation. The engine turns over. Don Luis slams the transmission into gear, but bangs into the crumbled Mercedes blocking his way. He slams the gearshift into reverse, bashes into the wall behind him, and then jerks the gear shift into drive, ramming the Mercedes with a little more room. Back and forth back and forth, Don Luis rams at the Mercedes until he has made enough room to turn the van, bang past the Mercedes, and smash his way out of the garage. 
EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY 
The van comes roaring out of the garage, tearing up the gardens, jumping on the driveway and speeding off to the main road. 
Cat comes running from the opposite direction, two guns blazing. 
INT. ARMORED VAN - DAY 
As bullets ping off the van, Don Luis regains some of his confidence. A small smile breaks across his face as he looks in his rear view mirror and sees Cat running and firing, losing ground. 
EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY 
Cat reaches the end of the driveway, fires her last shots, runs out of bullets. Stands watching the van head off down the road. 
INT. ARMORED VAN - DAY 
Don Luis watches her run out of ammo, standing in the road receding. 
DON LUIS (LAUGHING MADLY) I beat you bitch! You can't kill me! I am unkillable! 
EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY 
Cat stands in the road, watching the van. She takes out Marco's cellphone. 
CLOSE ON THE SCREEN 
Cat scrolls the phone book. She highlights VAN. Presses SEND. 
INT. ARMORED VAN - DAY 
Don Luis is at a red light, so pleased with himself. Humming a tune. When the van phone rings. Surprised, he looks at the call coming in. MARCO. He presses the speaker. 
DON LUIS Marco? 
CAT It's Cataleya. 
DON LUIS I don't understand you. You should have been dead a long time ago. You got lucky. You escaped. You were given a second chance at a life. Why did you not take it? Why did you involve yourself with this insanity? 
CAT For something you can never understand. The love I had for my parents. And you killed that.

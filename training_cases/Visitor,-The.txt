Written by 
Tom McCarthy 
INT. HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 
WALTER VALE, sixty-two, is standing by the window of his modestly furnished Colonial house. He is holding a glass of wine and peering out through the drapes. 
After a few moments an OLD CAR pulls up. A slightly overweight WOMAN gets out of the car. She starts to walk up to the house. 
Walter steps back from the window and waits. The doorbell rings. Walter takes a last sip of wine and sets the glass down on the end table. And then he goes to the door and opens it. 
WOMAN Mr. Vale? 
WALTER Yes. 
WOMAN Hello. I'm Barbra Watson. Nice to meet you. 
WALTER Yes. Come in. 
BARBARA Thank you. 
She steps into the house and Walter shuts the door. They both stand there awkwardly. Barbara is tightly wound and overcompensates with a forced pleasantness. 
WALTER Can I take your coat? 
BARBARA No, thank you. 
WALTER OK. Would you like anything to drink? 
BARBARA No. (Beat) Shall we get started? 
WALTER OK. 
INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, PIANO ROOM - LATER 
Walter and Barbara sit side by side in a very close proximity. 
BARBARA Let's try it again. 
WALTER The same thing? 
BARBARA Yes. Remember, fingers curved. Like a tunnel. 
WALTER OK. 
Walter starts to play the piano. It's a lesson in progress. They are sitting at a beautiful GRAND PIANO but Walter is only a beginner. And not a very good beginner. 
BARBARA Don't flatten. 
Walter keeps playing. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) Make room for the train. 
Walter stops. 
WALTER What? 
BARBARA I said "make room for the train." It's something that I tell my kids. If you curve your fingers like this... (She demonstrates) Then the train can pass through the tunnel. 
She passes her pencil through her curved fingers. Walter looks at her for a long moment. 
INT. WALTER'S HOUSE - DAY 
Walter walks Barbara to the front door. He opens it and then hands Barbara some money. 
WALTER Here. 
BARBARA Thank you. Next Tuesday at the same time? 
WALTER No. I don't think I'm going to continue with our lessons. 
BARBARA Oh, no. Are you giving up? 
WALTER No. 
Barbara gets the point. He is stopping with her, not the lessons. 
BARBARA Oh. OK. Goodbye. 
WALTER This is my apartment. 
AFRICAN WOMAN What do you mean? This apartment does not belong to you. How did you get in? 
WALTER My name is Walter Vale. I have keys. It's my... 
Suddenly Walter is pushed up against the wall. Hard. 
MAN'S VOICE What the fuck?! 
A very angry, YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN is in Walter's face. He grabs Walter violently by the collar and shakes him. 
YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN Who are you?! Zainab?! 
ZAINAB I'm in here! He is crazy! 
WALTER Stop it! I am not... 
The Young Middle Eastern Man slams him against the wall. It's more of a warning shot then a violent act. Walter is terrified. 
YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN Shut up! 
WALTER OK. OK. 
ZAINAB (O.S.) (In French) Tarek. What is happening? 
TAREK (In French) Are you OK? 
ZAINAB (In French) I'm fine. 
TAREK (In French) Who is this? 
ZAINAB (In French) I have no idea! I was in the bath and he was just standing there. 
TAREK (Shaking Walter) Did you touch her?! Did you touch her?! 
WALTER No! No! 
Zainab opens the door. 
ZAINAB (In French) He didn't touch me! But how did he get in? He said he has keys. 
TAREK Do you have keys? 
WALTER Yes! Yes! I have keys. It's my apartment. 
Tarek stares at Walter, trying to make sense of it. 
ZAINAB (in French) What does he mean it's his apartment? 
TAREK I don't know! Show me your keys! 
Walter reaches into his pocket and holds up his keys. 
WALTER This is my apartment. I've owned it for twenty-five years. 
TAREK So why haven't you been here!? 
WALTER I live in Connecticut. I haven't used it in a long time. 
Walter is starting to get through. 
TAREK Are you friends with Ivan? 
WALTER Ivan? Who is Ivan? 
Tarek is getting nervous. 
ZAINAB (In French) I knew this would happen! He probably called the police. 
This catches Tarek's attention. 
TAREK (to Walter) Did you call the police? 
Walter hesitates. 
WALTER No. 
TAREK You didn't call the police? 
WALTER No. 
He sees Zainab and Tarek exit the building and cross the street. Zainab's cart tips on the curb and the contents spill out onto the sidewalk. Tarek quickly moves to help her. Zainab yells at him. 
Walter watches as they finally collect their belongings and move down the street. 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - LATER 
Tarek has set his bags down in front of a closed store. He is talking in a very agitated tone on his cell phone. Zainab stands by silently. 
TAREK (In Arabic) Look I know. Come on man, it'll just be for a night or two until we figure something out. OK. 
ZAINAB Tarek? 
TAREK (In Arabic) Can you check and call me back? OK. Thanks. 
ZAINAB Tarek? 
TAREK What!? 
Zainab points. Walter is standing there holding the framed photograph. 
WALTER You left this at the apartment. 
Tarek walks over and takes it. 
TAREK Thanks. 
Walter nods. 
WALTER Do you know where you're going to stay tonight? 
TAREK Yeah. 
The lie is obvious. They are stuck. Walter just nods again. 
INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER 
Walter takes some books out of his briefcase. He crosses to the bookshelf and sets them down. He notices a small stack of CD's sitting on a shelf. He picks one of them up and stares at the CD for a long moment. 
TAREK You like classical music, huh? 
WALTER Yes. 
Walter sets down the CD. 
TAREK Me too. Do you play piano? 
WALTER No. (Beat) Do you? 
TAREK Me? No. I play the djembe. Well, thanks again for letting us stay. You saved me a lot of trouble. 
Walter nods. 
TAREK (CONT'D) See you in the morning. 
WALTER OK. Good night. 
Tarek goes to bed. Walter resumes his work.

Tarek and Zainab are lying in bed together. 
ZAINAB Stop it, Tarek. He'll hear us. 
TAREK Trust me. He's asleep. 
ZAINAB You don't know that. 
TAREK So let him hear. The guy probably needs some excitement. 
ZAINAB I think he's probably had enough for one night. 
Tarek nuzzles her. Zainab laughs but pushes him away. 
ZAINAB (CONT'D) Tarek. No! 
Zainab sits up in the bed. Tarek relents and rolls onto his back. 
Walter mingles at a reception. He is listening to another COLLEAGUE tell a story. 
COLLEAGUE #1 And so I just stood up and walked out! 
The group laughs. Stephen Kriegman approaches and talks to the COLLEAGUE. 
STEPHEN KRIEGMAN Jamie! 
JAMIE Stephen, how are you? 
Walter walks off. 
INT. NYU BANQUET HALL - LATER 
Walter eats dinner in a large, well appointed banquet room. Walter listens as a CHATTY MAN talks. 
INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER 
Walter is walking up the stairs carrying a briefcase. He passes a MIDDLE-AGED MAN who is walking down the stairs with a SMALL DOG on a leash. 
MIDDLE-AGED MAN (O.S.) Excuse me. 
Walter stops and turns. 
WALTER Yes. 
MIDDLE-AGED MAN Are you Mr. Vale? 
WALTER Yes. 
MIDDLE-AGED MAN I thought so. How are you? It's me, Jacob Konigsberg. Do you remember me? 
Walter doesn't. 
JACOB I used to live here with my mother. Your wife used to give me piano lessons. 
WALTER Oh. Right. 
JACOB It has been a long time. I thought that maybe you sold the place. Oh. This is Sprinkles. (To the dog) Say "hi", Sprinkles. Is your wife here with you? 
WALTER No. She passed away. 
JACOB What?! No! I had no idea. I'm so sorry. She was such a nice lady. And I just loved listening to her play. 
WALTER How's your mother? 
JACOB She moved to Florida. Now I live here. It's nice. There are a lot of new faces. I hardly know anyone anymore. But I have Sprinkles so... 
WALTER Nice to see you, Jacob. 
JACOB You too, Mr. Vale. Goodbye. Welcome back. 
Walter nods and keeps walking. 
INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER 
Walter walks into the apartment. No one else is there. 
He sets down his case and walks toward his bedroom but stops at Tarek and Zainab's door, which is closed. He listens. Nothing. 
INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER 
Walter is reading over and "rehearsing" the paper that he has to present. 
WALTER (Sotto) It is important to distinguish between both our current political assessment and our...It is important to distinguish between our current political assessment... 
He stops and crosses out the world "both". He continues reading. 
INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER

INT. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
TAREK (CONT'D) Yeah. I'll have a bit. Thanks. 
Zainab shoots Tarek a glance. Walter misreads it. 
WALTER Are you sure that you wouldn't like some? 
ZAINAB I don't drink. 
TAREK (Jokingly) She is a good Muslim. I'm a bad one. 
Walter nods. Zainab gets up and starts to clear the table. 
ZAINAB Are you finished? 
WALTER Yes. Thank you. Here, let me... 
ZAINAB It's the least I can do. 
Her comment is more of an indictment than a pleasantry. 
WALTER Well, thank you for the dinner. It was very good. 
ZAINAB You're welcome. 
She leaves the room. 
TAREK So what's the conference about? 
WALTER Economic Growth in Developing Nations. 
TAREK That's us. (Pointing) Syria. Senegal. 
TAREK (CONT'D) So have you written some books? 
WALTER Three. I'm working on my fourth. 
TAREK Four books?! Great. My father was a writer. A journalist. 
WALTER Is he still writing? 
TAREK No. He died. Before we left Syria. 
WALTER I'm sorry. 
TAREK So am I. 
Zainab enters. 
ZAINAB Tarek. It's eight-thirty. 
TAREK Oh. We have to go. (To Walter) I have a gig tonight. 
Zainab starts to put on her coat.   Tarek picks up his drum. 
TAREK (CONT'D) Walter, you can come if you want. 
Zainab shoots Tarek a glance. 
WALTER I have to get some work done but thank you. 
TAREK OK. Well maybe another time 
WALTER OK. 
TAREK Bye. 
Tarek and Zainab leave. Walter watches them go and then looks around the empty apartment. 
INT.    WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRS - CONTINUOUS 
Tarek and Zainab are walking down the stairs. 
ZAINAB (In French) Why did you invite him? 
TAREK (In French) We're staying in his apartment. What could I do? 
ZAINAB (In French) Well I would have been the one stuck sitting with him while you played your drum. 
Tarek turns and looks at her very seriously. 
TAREK You know you are very sexy when you're mad at me. 
TAREK (CONT'D) Now take the drum between your legs. Like this. 
Tarek grabs the drums with his knees. Walter follows. 
TAREK (CONT'D) Now you want to lift the inside edge off the ground with your ankles. Like this. 
Walter watches Tarek and follows suit. 
TAREK (CONT'D) Great. Feel OK? 
WALTER Yes. 
TAREK OK. Now Walter, I know you're a very smart man but with the drum you have to remember not to think. Thinking just screws it up. OK? 
WALTER OK. 
TAREK Now just give it a couple of bangs. 
Walter gives it a couple of hard bangs. 
TAREK (CONT'D) Not so hard. You're not angry at it. 
WALTER Oh. Right.     Sorry. 
He bangs it a few more times. 
TAREK Better. Did you think? 
WALTER No. 
TAREK Good. Now one more thing, Walter. You listen to classical music so you think in fours. One. Two. Three. Four. Da. Da. Da. Da. This is an African drum. So we are gonna play in three's. Tat. Tat. Tat. You have to forget your classical. Leave it behind. Tat. Tat. Tat. One. Two. Three. Come on. Follow me. 
Tarek bangs out a simple bass beat. Walter joins in. 
TAREK (CONT'D) Good. Good ear. Now keep going. 
Walter loses the beat.   Tarek keeps playing. 
TAREK (CONT'D) Don't worry. Start again. 
Walter tries again. And again. And then finally he gets it. 
TAREK (CONT'D) Yeah! There it is. OK. Good. Now keep it going and I will do this. 
Tarek riffs off of Walter's bass beat. 
TAREK (CONT'D) Yeah. That's it. Keep it going. 
EXT. STREET FAIR - DAY 
Zainab is closing up her booth. Another VENDOR walks by and says good bye. Zainab smiles and nods good bye. 
EXT. NEW YORK - STREET 
Zainab is walking home with her supplies. Two NEW YORK POLICE OFFICERS are talking to THREE YOUNG HISPANIC KIDS. Zainab hesitates for the slightest moment before lowering her head and walking past. 
INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER 
Zainab enters the apartment and sees Walter drumming. His shirt is unbuttoned exposing his white undershirt. He stops. He is breathing very hard and sweating. 
WALTER Hello. 
ZAINAB Hello. Where is Tarek? 
She places her items down on the kitchen table and takes off her coat. She looks around the apartment. 
WALTER He went out. To look at another apartment. 
She just looks at him with the drum. Walter is still out of breath. 
ZAINAB Are you OK? 
WALTER Yeah. Tarek is teaching me the drum. I'm practicing. Don't worry, I'll keep my pants on. 
Zainab looks shocked. Walter's attempt at levity has fallen short. 
ZAINAB What? 
WALTER Nothing. I was just...nothing. 
Zainab nods and walks into the kitchen. 
Walter and Tarek are finishing lunch. Tarek reaches into his bag and takes out a SMALL BAG. 
TAREK Here. This is for you. For letting us stay. 
WALTER Thank you. 
Walter takes it and opens it. It's a CD. 
TAREK It's Fela Kuti. You know him? 
WALTER No. 
TAREK You don't know Fela? Oh, man! Walter, you are in for a treat. He started the whole Afro-Beat movement. And his drummer Tony Allen was just scary, man. You want to play drums, you have to listen to this. 
WALTER OK. I will. 
A HANDSOME ARAB MAN walks past with a PRETTY BLONDE WOMAN. Tarek sees him and waves. 
OMAR (In Arabic) Hey Tarek. How's it going? 
TAREK (in Arabic) Good, Omar. How are you? 
OMAR (In Arabic) Not bad. It's fall in New York, you know? How's the band?

OMAR (In Arabic) New friend. 
TAREK (In Arabic) You have a lot friends 
OMAR (In Arabic) I'm a very nice guy. Au revoir.

WALTER Yeah. 
They pick up their drums and leave. 
EXT.    NEW YORK STREET FAIR - LATER

ZAINAB Thirty-five dollars. 
UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN Will you take thirty? 
ZAINAB No. thiry-five. 
UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN OK. I know my daughter will think it's "cool". Here. 
She hands her the money. Zainab takes it and drops it into a small pouch. 
UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN (CONT'D) Where are you from? 
ZAINAB Senegal. 
UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN Oh. I was in Cape Town two winters ago. It was just beautiful. 
ZAINAB (Handing her the bag) Thank you very much. 
UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN Thank you. 
The Woman walks away. A young Israeli man, ZEV is sitting at a nearby stall selling T-shirts. 
ZEV How far is Senegal from Cape Town? 
ZAINAB Far. 
ZEV I told a guy I was from Israel yesterday and he asked if I had ever visited the Holy Land. 
Zainab smiles. Zev sees someone over Zainab's shoulder. 
ZEV (CONT'D) Hey, look who it is. What's up Tarek? 
WALTER I think I'll just watch. 
TAREK Come on, Walter. 
TAREK (CONT'D) It's easy. You just wait until you feel it. Let's go. 
Tarek joins the drum circle. Walter lingers. 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER. 
Walter is on the edge of the Drum Circle, waiting to "feel it". Tarek is next to him playing away. 
Tarek looks at Walter and nods. Finally Walter starts to play. Slowly at first, but then he starts to really commit. Tarek encourages him with a smile. 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER 
Tarek and Walter are leaving the park. Tarek checks his watch. 
TAREK Shit, we have to get home. Zainab is gonna kill me. I'm on Arab time again.

INT. 72ND STREET SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS 
Walter and Tarek approach the turnstile.     They can hear the train arriving. 
TAREK That's our train! 
They pick up the pace. Walter puts down his drum to take out his METROCARD. Tarek quickly picks it up. 
TAREK (CONT'D) I got your drum. My card is empty. Can you swipe me? 
Walter swipes his card for Tarek to pass through and then he swipes his own turnstile. 
Walter passes through. Tarek struggles a bit with both drums. He gets halfway through when the turnstile bar locks. He's stuck. 
TAREK (CONT'D) (Laughing) Hey. You paid for the drum and not me. Here take this. 
Walter takes Tarek's drum and Tarek quickly ducks under the turn style that Walter just paid for. 
TAREK (CONT'D) (Re: the train) I think we missed it. Zainab is not going to be happy if... 
Suddenly a MAN takes Tarek by the arm. 
MAN Excuse me, sir. Could you please step over here. 
Tarek reacts by pulling his arm away. 
TAREK What are you doing? 
MAN NYPD. Could you please step over here? 
He reaches for Tarek again who instinctively moves his arm again which agitates the Cop. Another COP enters into the action. 
COP #2 Just step over here, pal. 
TAREK Please, what do you want... 
COP #1 You jumped the turnstile. 
TAREK I did not jump it! I paid. I paid! It just didn't work. 
Walter steps up. 
WALTER Sir, I did pay his fare. 
COP #2 Could you step back please? 
WALTER But I paid this man's... 
COP #2 Sir, stand over there. 
COP #1 (To Tarek) Can I see some ID. 
Tarek takes out his wallet. He shows them an ID CARD. Walter steps back to the wall and sets the two drums down. Cop #2 stands between him and the action. Walter can barely make out what is being said. 
ZAINAB Well? 
WALTER They've moved him. 
ZAINAB To where? 
WALTER To a detention center in Queens. He was turned over to immigration. They said we can see him during visiting hours tomorrow night from five to ten. 
Zainab shakes her head. 
ZAINAB I can't visit him or I will end up in that place too. 
Zainab fights to restrain her emotions. She turns and walks away. Walter watches her go.

MR. SHAH Zainab, you're also undocumented, right? 
ZAINAB Yes. 
MR. SHAH You know you can't visit Tarek at the detention center, right? 
ZAINAB Yes. I know. 
MR. SHAH How long have you known Tarek? 
ZAINAB Almost a year. 
MR. SHAH Mr. Vale? 
WALTER A week. 
MR. SHAH A week? 
Walter nods. 
MR. SHAH (CONT'D) Does Tarek have any family living here? 
Walter looks to Zainab. 
ZAINAB His mother lives in Michigan. 
This is news to Walter. 
MR. SHAH She's also undocumented, correct? 
Zainab hesitates. 
MR. SHAH (CONT'D) It's OK. This is all confidential. 
ZAINAB Yes, she is. 
MR. SHAH Does she know that Tarek is in custody? 
ZAINAB No. Tarek told me not to tell her. He doesn't want to worry her. 
MR. SHAH Has he ever been convicted of a crime? 
ZAINAB No. He has had no trouble. He is a good person. 
MR. SHAH Do you know if they ever applied for asylum? 
Tarek shakes his head. 
WALTER Did he say anything else? 
TAREK Yeah. Three years ago I was working for some guy who said he was going to sponsor me for my green card but then he turned out to be jerk. But the lawyer said that might allow us to reopen the case. I don't even understand it. 
Walter nods. 
TAREK (CONT'D) Walter, there are guys who have been in here for years! I can't do that Walter. I'll go crazy. 
WALTER He's trying to deal with the case as quickly as possible. 
Tarek goes silent. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Tarek. I have to go back to Connecticut. I'll be reachable by phone if you need me for anything. 
Tarek's mind is racing. He shakes his head. 
TAREK OK. Just please...don't forget about me in here. 
WALTER I won't. 
TAREK Are you still practicing? 
WALTER Yes. 
TAREK You should go back to the drum circle. 
WALTER (Quickly) No. 
Tarek laughs. 
TAREK OK. But listen to that Fela CD. That will help you, I promise. 
WALTER I will. 
TAREK So show me what you've been working on. 
WALTER What? 
TAREK Show me. On that. Come on. I need some music, man. 
Tarek points to the shelf in front of Walter. 
WALTER Now? 
TAREK Don't worry. They can't arrest you. At least not yet. 
WALTER OK. 
Walter looks around and then cradles the phone in his shoulder and starts to bang a simple beat on his counter top. Tarek watches and listens for a moment. 
TAREK Ah. There it is. Good. Good. You are getting better. 
And then he joins in. The two men continue to play together.

WALTER Hello. 
ARAB WOMAN I'm sorry. I must have the wrong apartment. 
She starts to walk down the hall. 
WALTER Can I help you? 
ARAB WOMAN I'm looking for my son. 
WALTER Are you Tarek's mother? 
ARAB WOMAN Yes. 
WALTER Oh. This is Tarek's apartment. I...share the apartment with him. 
The Arab Woman is cautious. 
Walter and Mouna stop across the street from the detention Center. 
WALTER That's it. 
MOUNA This is where the prison is? 
WALTER Yes. That's it. 
Walter points to the Detention Center. 
MOUNA It does not look like a prison. 
WALTER I think that's the point. 
MOUNA How many people are in there? 
WALTER Tarek said about three hundred. 
WALTER (CONT'D) There is a coffee shop on that corner. It's not very nice but... 
MOUNA I'll wait there. Here.

Finally a door opens and Tarek walks out. He waves and smiles. Walter picks up his phone. Tarek picks up his. 
TAREK Walter, I thought you were leaving. 
WALTER I was.   Tarek, your mother is here. 
This stops Tarek cold. 
TAREK What? My mother?! Where? 
WALTER She is waiting outside. 
TAREK When did she arrive? 
WALTER Today. 
TAREK Oh man. Why did she come? She can do nothing for me. 
WALTER She said she hadn't heard from you. 
TAREK Walter. Listen to me. She can not stay here. She doesn't know anyone in New York. I'm sorry but you must get her to go back to Michigan.

Walter takes it out and puts it up to the glass.

MOUNA (In Arabic) I am Palestinian from Damascus. 
WAITER (In Arabic) Ah. I knew it. I am from Egypt. Alexandria. I'm Nasim. Why are you here? 
MOUNA (In Arabic) I am visiting my son.

MOUNA Thank you for your offer but I cannot accept this. I don't want to impose on you. 
WALTER You're not imposing. Please. I would like you to stay. 
MOUNA Again, thank you. But I will manage. Goodbye.

WALTER (CONT'D) Please. I was with Tarek when he was arrested. He was in the subway in the first place because of me. Please. Stay. Even if it's just for the night. 
Walter's plea is heartfelt. Mouna looks at him and then she looks down the stairs for a long moment, considering her options.

Walter walks out of his bedroom. He hears talking from the living room. He walks down the hall and sees Mouna sitting on the couch in the living room, talking on her cell phone in Arabic. He turns and walks back down the hallway. 
INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN 
Walter pours a cup of coffee. He notices two newspaper's on the counter. One is the Financial Times and the other is Al Hayat, an Arabic newspaper. He picks up the Financial Times and reads the front page. Mouna enters. 
MOUNA Good morning. 
MR. SHAH Well, it wouldn't be the first time that happened. And pre 9/11 it wasn't much of a priority tracking people down. 
Mouna bristles at the implied connection. 
WALTER So if they didn't get the letter then does this help us? 
MR. SHAH It keeps our chances alive. If they got it and just ignored it then we couldn't push to reopen the case. 
MOUNA So you can help him? 
MR. SHAH It's still a long shot. Like I said, the Government's approach has changed radically. (MORE) 
MR. SHAH (CONT'D) It's very black and white now. Either you belong or you don't. Which means a lot of people who have been living here for years are suddenly being swept up and thrown into detention. (He starts writing) Tarek's lucky. Most of them don't even have lawyers. 
Mouna blanches. 
MOUNA Lucky? 
MR. SHAH (Without looking up) Relatively speaking. We just have to move quickly to get an emergency stay from the board of immigration. Then, we'll stick with the motion to reopen pending his green card application. 
Mouna and Walter share a look. They're lost. 
MOUNA Can you explain what that means? 
MR. SHAH Actually, I don't have the time right now. I have to be in court very shortly 
MOUNA How long will he be in detention? 
MR. SHAH (Without looking up) I can't predict that. I'm sorry but I am gonna have to wrap this up. 
Walter looks at Mouna. Mouna stares at the Mr. Shah. 
MOUNA Do you have children, Mr. Shah? 
MR. SHAH Yeah. Two kids. And for what it's worth my uncle was deported after raising a family here for twenty- three years. If I can get Tarek out, I will. 
Mouna softens. 
MOUNA Thank you. Where are you from? 
MR. SHAH Queens.

MOUNA She is very black. 
EXT. NEW YORK STREET FAIR - LATER 
Zainab is sitting at her table when Walter approaches. Zainab smiles. She is genuinely surprised and happy to see him. 
ZAINAB Walter? 
WALTER Hi Zainab. This is Mouna Khalil. Tarek's mother. 
Zainab blanches. 
ZAINAB Oh. 
She quickly stands up. 
MOUNA Hello, Zainab. 
ZAINAB It is a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Khalil. 
MOUNA Please. Call me Mouna. 
ZAINAB OK. I'm sorry. I did not know you were coming. 
MOUNA Neither did I. 
Mouna looks at her for a long moment. Then she inspects her jewelry. Zainab is uncharacteristically nervous. 
Walter's cheap shot lands. Mouna is stung. 
MOUNA I didn't mean to pry. 
There is an awkward silence. 
WALTER I shouldn't have spoken to you like that. 
MOUNA It's OK. 
Walter picks up the wine bottle and fills his glass.

Walter is sitting on the edge of his bed and takes off his shoes. He pauses.

WALTER Thank you. You have my number if you need anything.

EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - DAY 
WALTER Has anyone said anything to you? 
TAREK No one in here knows anything. I'm not a criminal. I have committed no crime. What do they think? I'm a terrorist? There are no terrorists in here. The terrorists have money. They have support. This is not fair! 
WALTER I know. 
TAREK (Angrily) How do you know?! You're out there! 
Tarek's question stops Walter in his tracks. Tarek tries to regain his composure. 
WALTER I'm sorry. 
TAREK It's just... I'm starting to wonder if I'm ever going to get out of here. I sit in here at night and I keep thinking about Zainab. 
TAREK (CONT'D) I just want to play my music and live my life. What's so wrong about that? 
EXT. NEW YORK CAFE - DAY 
Walter, Mouna and Zainab are sitting at a cafe. Walter is on his cell phone. 
WALTER (Into the phone) OK. OK. Please do. Thank you. Bye. 
He hangs up. 
MOUNA What did he say? 
WALTER He would make some calls but they can move him to another facility at their discretion. 
ZAINAB What facility? Where? 
WALTER He said it could be anywhere. Upstate. Pennsylvania. There is even one in Louisiana. 
ZAINAB Louisiana? Where they had the floods? 
WALTER Yes. 
MOUNA That's so far. 
WALTER Yeah. 
MOUNA Did the lawyer say anything else?

WALTER Yes. 
They leave. 
INT. NEW YORK CAB - LATER 
WALTER I want to. 
MOUNA But you have to be in Connecticut. You have your teaching. And your book. 
WALTER It's fine really. 
MOUNA This is not your problem, Walter. It's OK that you are busy. 
Her simple words strike a chord with Walter. 
WALTER I'm not busy. Not at all. (Beat) Mouna, the truth is I haven't been doing any work for a long time. 
MOUNA You just presented your paper at the conference. 
He is beginning to unravel. 
WALTER I didn't even write it. I just read it. I've been teaching the same course for twenty years. It doesn't mean anything to me. None of it does. I pretend. I pretend that I'm busy. That I'm writing. Working. But I'm not doing anything. 
Walter trails off. 
WALTER (CONT'D) I'm sorry. 
MOUNA Don't be. I appreciate you telling me this. 
The Waiter returns and pours some more water. 
MOUNA (CONT'D) Walter, what would you do if you didn't teach? 
WALTER I don't know. 
MOUNA I think that is exciting. Not to know. 
Walter considers this as if for the first time. He smiles. 
WALTER Mouna, what do you do?

WALTER I think that happens a lot in New York. 
MOUNA Thank you, Walter. That was a very nice evening. It's the most fun I've had in a long time. 
WALTER I told Tarek I was going to take you. He was very happy about it. 
Mouna is touched by the comment. Her mood shifts. 
MOUNA Good night, Walter. 
WALTER Good night. 
And with that she turns and walks into her bedroom. 
INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
Walter wakes up. He checks his watch. He notices that his phone is blinking. A message. He picks it up and listens to it. 
WALTER Damn it! 
He reaches the exit and then spins around and storms back toward the guard booth. He completely loses control. 
WALTER (Angrily shouting) You can't just take people away like that! Do you hear me?! He was a good man. A good person! He had a life here! You can't just take away whoever you want! (MORE) 
WALTER (CONT'D) It's not fair! We are not just helpless children! Do you hear me?! 
The Guard just stares back blankly. The other visitors watch in disbelief. They are unaccustomed to this type of outburst as is Walter who now stands trembling in the middle of the room. 
It's as if something inside him snapped. Something that he has been holding on to for a long time. He is suddenly adrift. Unsure of what to do next. 
MOUNA (O.S.) (Gently) Walter. 
Walter turns. Mouna is standing there. He looks at her. Helpless. 
MOUNA (CONT'D) Walter. Let's go. There is nothing we can do. Let's go. 
Walter looks a bit lost. He looks back at the Guard who just stares back at him. 
MOUNA (CONT'D) Come on, Walter. 
She reaches out and takes Walter's hand. And then she leads him out. 
INT. NEW YORK TAXI - LATER

MOUNA Walter, I need to go back to Syria. I should to be there for Tarek. 
WALTER When are you going to leave? 
MOUNA Tomorrow. I already bought a ticket. It's best for me to be there as soon as possible. 
Walter just looks at her. The news is piercing. 
WALTER You won't be able to come back here. 
MOUNA I know. 
Beat. 
WALTER Mouna. I'm sorry. 
Mouna smiles warmly. 
MOUNA Good night, Walter. 
Mouna leans in and kisses him gently on the cheek. She turns and walks toward her room. Walter watches her go and then looks back onto the street. 
INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - LATER 
Walter is lying awake in bed. There is a knock at the door. He sits up. 
WALTER Yes. 
The door opens and a shaft of light cuts across the room. Mouna stands in the doorway. 
Walter stares at her for a moment and then turns down the bed sheets. Mouna walks over and lies down next time. Walter pulls the sheets back over her. 
They sit in silence for a long moment holding each other. 
MOUNA It's my fault. What happened to Tarek. I did receive the letter telling us to leave. I threw it away. I never told him. 
Walter can only listen. 
MOUNA (CONT'D) We were here for three years by the time the letter arrived. I had found a job. Tarek was in school. Everyone told me not to worry. That the government did not care. And it appeared to be true. And then, after time, you forget. You think that you really belong. 
Walter gently touches her. 
WALTER It's not your fault.

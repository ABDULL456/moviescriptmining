ON GREER'S SCANNER - "NEW-U RENTAL AGENCY," with an ID NUMBER, but no name. GREER kneels beside the PSYCHO's body, pockets his scanner. He's angry but resigned, he was half expecting this. THE SEMI DRIVER is still behind the wheel of his rig. He calls out to Greer: 
SEMI DRIVER Am I in trouble? 
GREER (waves him off) Nah, go back to work. GREER rises as his PHONE CHIMES, he touches his earpiece. IN BG, the DRIVER pulls away. 
GREER (CONT'D) 
PETERS (FILTER) 
GREER He's a rental. He disconnects, reaches to turn the PSYCHO's head to one side. The back of his skull is smashed. Instead of gore and brains, we see torn GRAY PLASTIC and dense CIRCUITRY, oozing pinkish hydraulic fluid at his neck. We're in a world of SURROGATES, remotely operated synthetic humans (also known as SYNTHs). These are not artificially-intelligent robots-- each is linked directly to a human being, miles or hundreds of miles away. Surrogates are distinguishable from flesh-and-blood humans primarily by their physical perfection-- ugly surrogates are rare. On closer look, their eyes may have an inhuman quality. Without a human mind sending and receiving impulses, they are completely inert. Suddenly the PSYCHO comes to life, spins his head around at an impossible angle and BITES GREER'S HAND. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He won't let go. Greer stomps on the-PSYCHO's head, reaches with his other hand into the back of the skull to wrench out a CIRCUIT BOARD. The PSYCHO finally stops writhing, disconnected. 
INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT 
PETERS talks on the phone while scanning a SEVERED HEAD. 
PETERS I don't recommend reconnecting, Ms. Welles... hello? The WOMAN on the floor TWITCHES, her eyes open. She sits up on her elbows, looks down to see-- --her legs are gone. The bottom half of her is missing, her tattered T-shirt covers the damage, soaked with dark green and pink liquids-- coolant and hydraulic fluids. 
VICTIM Aw crap, I'm totalled! 
PETERS Your insurance ought to cover it. 
EXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT 
GREER trudges toward the building, on his cell, leaving the body behind. He turns the CIRCUIT BOARD over in his fingers. 
GREER --trash pick-up on Maple and 4th. 
DISPATCHER (FILTER) Coulda just called it in, we'd a shut him down from here-- 
GREER Any ID from the rental agency? 
DISPATCHER (FILTER) Yeah, got a name from their office in Miami. Ness, Harold P. 
GREER 
(A BEAT) Harry P. Ness. 
DISPATCHER Oh. False ID? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GREER You think? 
DISPATCHER Don't be in a rush to get home, Tom. Two surries down outside The Pit, hard-core club on F street. GREER picks up the pace, heads OUT OF FRAME. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT 
START ON THE BLONDE, eyes empty, face against the cement. 
PETERS Abandoned. 
GREER Or something happened to the operator. GREER and PETERS stand over the corpse, a UNIFORM stands nearby. Greer holds his SCANNER near her head. 
GREER (CONT'D) Registered to a Cameron Michaels, out in Clarksburg... 
(TO UNIFORM) You call her? 
UNIFORM Left a message. GREER is leaning closer to the dead Blonde's face. X-CLOSE-- CRACKS in the GLASS of her eye. We see GREER'S FRAGMENTED REFLECTION as he peers at this. 
GREER Optics are damaged. 
PETERS Musta cracked when she fell. 
COMMERCIAL V.0. (CONT'D) Now... a better world. A BEAUTIFUL GIRL ENTERS FRAME, turns TO CAMERA and smiles. Behind her, more happy, healthy, handsome YOUNG PEOPLE in an abstract, WHITE SPACE. WIDER, there are THOUSANDS of them. 
COMMERCIAL V.0. (CONT'D) Virtual Self Industries. ON TV - The LOGO for VSI comes on the screen. 
COMMERCIAL V.0. (CONT'D) Do what you want. Be what you want. 
CUT TO: 
INT. COLLEGE DORM - DAY 
A wood-paneled hallway of an Ivy League dorm, TWO MALE UNDERGRADS (pimply, glasses, overweight, clearly not surries) KNOCK on a dorm room door. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
UNDERGRAD #1 Yo, Canter! 
UNDERGRAD #2 Maybe he's still hung over. 
UNDERGRAD #1 He's gonna miss the exam. They try the door-- unlocked. 
INT. DORM ROOM - DAY 
As soon as they enter, the UNDERGRADS choke on the stench, covering their noses. 
UNDERGRAD #1 Aw, Jesus... IN THE BED is a YOUNG MALE CORPSE, a SENSORY PROJECTOR attached to his head, the RED GLOW. OVERHEAD LIGHTS flick on to reveal goopy BLOOD at his nose and ears, the pillow soaked. 
GREER (V.0.) Tuxedo's operator turned up, student at Yale name of Anthony Canter... 
CUT TO: 
INT. FBI BUILDING/GREER'S OFFICE - DAY 
Cluttered with papers, two desks. GREER sits before a TERMINAL, staring at his screen. 
GREER They're uploading his memory file. Seems we're dealing with an actual homicide. PETERS, at the other (much neater) desk, leans in to look over Greer's shoulder while the file uploads. 
PETERS You sound pleased. 
GREER Well, you get a little tired of property crime, vandalism-- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PETERS Thought you took your job seriously. Surrogates are extensions of people's selves-- 
GREER What are you, quoting VSI? 
PETERS The Supreme Court. ANTHONY STONE, Greer's BOSS, has entered Greer's office during the above. He's silver-haired, friendly, in perfect shape-- another surrogate. He's clearly heard this argument before. 
PETERS (CONT'D) Synthetic units have the same rights as biologicals. 
GREER Yeah, yeah. Fact is, most of the people you refer to as Dreads are just too poor to afford a synth. You think they like living on reservations? 
PETERS That's humanist propaganda. The restricted areas were their idea, they hate being around surries. 
STONE Get a room, you two. He leans between them, hits a button on Greer's computer. ON SCREEN - A NEW HAVEN PD LOGO at the top of the screen, indicating this is an EVIDENCE FILE. In a large WINDOW, TUXEDO'S POV RECORDING plays. We now see the foreplay in the alley from the other perspective. FOOTSTEPS, Tuxedo pulls away from the BLONDE-- --and turns to confront THE HELMETED ASSASSIN. TUXEDO's 
VOICE: - 
TUXEDO (O.S.) Get lost, meatbag. THE ASSASSIN narrows his eyes-- then WHITE LIGHT fills the screen, the BLONDE'S SCREAM CUTS OUT as the audio goes. Then STATIC and BLACKNESS. GREER, PETERS and STONE react to this. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
GREER Poor kid. Pathologist said his brains looked like soup. 
PETERS 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CANTER That's right. You're with the FBI. 
PETERS Yes we are. He leads them into-- 
INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/STUDY - DAY 
A traditional study, wood paneling, books. WINDOWS lead to a BALCONY. ARMANDO remains IN BG throughout scene. 
PETERS We're very sorry for your loss, sir. 
CANTER What progress have you made with the investigation? 
GREER I can't help noticing, your surrogate-- it's very similar to the unit your son was using... Canter pauses, then moves to a DOOR and opens it.- LIGHTS INSIDE FLICKER ON, revealing-- --a WALK-IN CLOSET with a half-dozen CHARGING BAYS. Four surrogates here, all versions of the man we've just seen-- Canter at different stages of life, from youth to almost elderly. Two of the charging bays are empty. 
CANTER I allowed Tony to borrow one of my surrogates when he wanted to spend time in D.C. I encouraged him to take advantage of the cultural 
OFFERINGS-- 
PETERS Wait, how is that possible? Aren't your surries locked to your neural signature? 
CANTER (closing the door) I wrote the code that remains at the core of all surrogates. It wasn't difficult for me to make my synth units accessible to my son. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GREER - Like getting the keys to dad's car. 
CANTER I suppose... 
(BEAT) The coroner says that Tony was online when it happened. Why hasn't the surrogate been returned to me? 
PETERS We're still analyzing the damage-- 
CANTER It was attacked? 
PETERS We really can't get into the details of an ongoing investigation-- 
GREER Dr. Canter-- we don't know of any way to kill an operator remotely. Do you? 
CANTER No, but-- at the beginning, all of us at VSI were worried about it. It's why every surrogate has a built-in fail-safe, they disconnect before they can transmit a potentially dangerous signal. 
PETERS Can you think of anyone who might want to harm your son? 
CANTER I... the sad fact is, Tony and I were just getting to know each other... he grew up with his mother in California. Canter's voice drifts off, he's starting to look far away, pained. He sits slowly behind his desk. 
CANTER (CONT'D) If this wasn't an accident... then it's because of me that he's... 
(BEAT) I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse me. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) Before Greer and Peters can reply, Canter goes rigid, eyes blank-- he's disconnected. 
GREER Guess the interview's over. 
PETERS 
(QUIETLY) Can you imagine what it's like to lose your only child? Greer scribbles something on a BUSINESS CARD. 
GREER Not really. You got kids? 
PETERS (shakes her head) Jim and I talked about it, but... 
GREER Lot of that going around. He starts to place the card on the desk before the immobile Canter. Armando steps forward warily-- Greer shows him the card before putting it down. 
GREER (CONT'D) If he thinks of anything else. 
WELCH Really. Do give him my regards-- The MALE LAWYER cuts him off, leaning across the table to shake hands. 
MALE LAWYER We're from the legal department. 
FEMALE LAWYER Hope you don't mind if we sit in. 
PETERS Not at all. I didn't get your names--? 
WELCH 
(OVER HER) You might be interested in a free software upgrade we're offering to all law enforcement officials, better night vision for your synth unit, improved pursuit capability... 
GREER Mm. Any idea what could cause a surrogate's head to explode from the inside? On the table, in a plastic EVIDENCE BAG, is a fried CIRCUIT-BOARD along with a pair of SHATTERED EYEBALLS. Greer passes this to Welch, who barely looks at it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MALE LAWYER Mr. Welch isn't qualified to answer that question. You'd be better off speaking to one of our technicians. WELCH smiles pleasantly. 
FEMALE LAWYER What does the operator say? 
GREER Not much. He's dead. 
PETERS A massive brain hemmorhage, it happened while he was online. 
FEMALE LAWYER I'm sorry to hear that. But I can assure you it has nothing to do with VSI products. If a man suffers a heart attack while driving, he doesn't have a case against the automobile manufacturer. WELCH nods in agreement. GREER gamely continues to address his questions to the VP. 
GREER No one's talking lawsuit. we'd just like to know, is there any precedent for an operator being killed by signals from his synth unit? 
MALE LAWYER 
(ALMOST INDIGNANT) 
NONE WHATSOEVER-- 
FEMALE LAWYER The idea is absurd. If it were possible, it would defeat the purpose of surrogacy. 
MALE LAWYER Surries have jumped from bridges, been shot or blown to bits without the least harm to the operators- the fail-safes always kick in. Every case that's been brought against VSI has been shown to be the result of user negligence. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
FEMALE LAWYER We can't help it if customers forget to eat, sleep or take their medicine. WELCH shrugs and rises, followed by the lawyers. 
WELCH If that's all... a pleasure talking with you. 
GREER There is one more thing. The victim was Anthony Canter. The son of one of your company's founders. GREER studies them as they process this news. 
GREER (CONT'D) Kind of a strange coincidence. 
WELCH Dr. Canter has retired, but we'll be sure to send our condolences. 
EXT. VSI HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
GREER and PETERS move from a glass corporate tower, across beautifully manicured gardens. GREER carries the evidence in a briefcase. 
PETERS What's our take-away? 
GREER 
(SHRUGS) I used to be able to read people, back when they were people... 
PETERS You mean before they all became lawyers? 
GREER 
(A SMILE) You made a joke. Maybe there's hope for you, Peters... They head for a MANUFACTURING COMPLEX. 
INT. VSI FACTORY - DAY 
BRANDON Yeah, I'll be right over. He CLAPS a CAPTAIN on the shoulder as he moves out. 
BRANDON (CONT'D) Keep an eye on Bravo company. 
CAPTAIN We will kick some ass, sir. 
EXT. MARINE BASE - DAY 
HANGARS, boxy buildings, HUMVEES, SOLDIERS marching in formation. BRANDON walks with GREER and PETERS. 
BRANDON The United States has the largest surrogate army in.the world. Why on earth would the defense department want to develop a weapon that could wipe out our own troops? 
GREER So no such thing exists? 
BRANDON If it did, I'd know about it. 
PETERS Those soldiers we saw-- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BRANDON (a bit impatient) We routinely remove motherboards and optics for analysis. Now if you'll excuse me, we're in the middle of a peacekeeping operation. They've reached their car. Brandon turns on his heel and heads back for a hangar. Greer and Peters look after him for a moment. 
PETERS Think he's telling the truth? 
GREER Not when his lips are moving. Greer shakes his head as they both get in the car. WITH BRANDON - Out of earshot of the feds, he speaks into a small earpiece. 
BRANDON Bill, we may have a problem. Is it possible one of our ODs is loose? 
CUT TO: 
INT. FBI BUILDING/GREER'S OFFICE - DAY 
CANTER'S IMAGE on a COMPUTER SCREEN. It's his surrogate face, seated at his desk. This is a video-phone connection. 
CANTER Tell me, have you made any progress whatsoever? REVERSE ANGLE, Greer and Peters sit before the screen. 
BY ROTE: 
GREER Sir, we are not at liberty to comment on an ongoing investigation. 
CANTER Don't blow me off like I'm some goddamn reporter. I have resources of my own, do I have to do your jobs for you? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: GREER bites back his anger, rises and moves away from the screen before he says something he'll regret. He sits at ANOTHER TERMINAL, returns to work. Peters takes his place, attempting to sound reassuring. 
PETERS We're exploring every avenue, Dr. Canter, I promise you that, we're doing everything we can. CLOSE ON GREER'S TERMINAL - An INSET of the image of the ASSASSIN'S FACE, no helmet on-- it's much clearer than the one we saw before, this being the bouncer's perspective at the door of the club. We hear CANTER and PETERS continue in BG. 
CANTER What. What are you doing? 
PETERS I understand you're grieving-- 
CANTER I'm a target for assassination! I assume you're at least aware of that. WITH PETERS, she looks briefly over her shoulder at Greer with a "help, get me out of this" expression. He remains focussed on the image of the assassin, she turns back to Canter on the screen, maintaining her placating tone. 
PETERS I appreciate your concern and frustration, obviously we all want immediate results, but-- 
CANTER I've heard enough of your condescending pap. The people who did this are going to be punished. CANTER DISCONNECTS, his angry face VANISHES. PETERS rises and moves quickly toward Greer. 
GREER You handled that well. 
PETERS (points at screen) Where'd you get this? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
GREER The freak who was working the door at the club. Got a look at our perp dead-on. ON SCREEN - The Assassin's features HIGHLIGHT, the words 
"756 PARTIAL MATCHES." REVERSE ANGLE -- GREER types, PETERS watches. 
EXT. BALTIMORE SLUMS - DAY 
WITH STRICKLAND, finishing his cell call. 
STRICKLAND .maybe I'm not done with the O.D. Maybe you're not gonna get it back at all. Guy could have a lot of fun with your little toy... oh you can do better than that. I'll be in touch... He tosses the cellphone in a trashcan, pulls on his helmet, STARTS the bike and peels out. 
EXT. BALTIMORE - DAY 
AERIAL SHOT - CAMERA tracking over the CHESAPEAKE BAY and into the city, late afternoon. A small black CHOPPER with doorless openings on either side ENTERS FRAME. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY 
GREER is beside a PILOT, a handsome Hispanic surrie named LOPEZ. Greer shouts over the BLADE ROAR: 
GREER We're close! Noise suppression! LOPEZ nods, hits a couple of switches. THE LOUD THROB becomes a barely audible WHIRR. We hear PETERS' VOICE over the radio: 
PETERS (FILTER) Got a hit on the bike, half a mile from the rez, check your screen. ON THE CHOPPER DASH, A GPS DISPLAY of the nearby neighborhood, a BLINKING DOT a short distance away. 
PETERS (FILTER) (CONT'D) Baltimore PD's sending back-up. You can't fly over Dread territory, you know. We don't 
HAVE JURISDICTION-- Greer clicks off the radio, turns to Lopez. 
GREER Ignore her, Lopez. Get us as close as you can. LOPEZ grins--and pushes the stick hard-- 
EXT. BALTIMORE - DAY 
THE CHOPPER banks and swoops almost silently. 
TNT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY BOBBY glances over at PETERS as she monitors a GPS SCREEN and various INSET VIDEO FEEDS. He continues to work as he flirts with her. 
BOBBY You really look like your surrie? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: PETERS throws him a glare, turns back to her work. 
BOBBY (CONT'D) Don't be so touchy. I'm engaged to B-47 down there. He points to one of the many identical female DRONES buzzing along the tracks. PETERS smiles. 
EXT. BALTIMORE SLUMS - DUSK 
STRICKLAND moves briskly on his BIKE. He glances in his MIRROR and sees-- --a couple of SQUAD CARS catching up with him. He hits the THROTTLE. ANOTHER COP CAR roars around the corner ahead of him, SQUAWKS the SIREN. STRICKLAND changes direction, veers into a narrow alley. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK 
LOPEZ and GREER are directly overhead, watching STRICKLAND maneuver his bike quickly into the alley. 
EXT. SLUM ALLEY - DUSK 
The alley is a DEAD END, a FENCE blocking the exit. STRICKLAND skids the bike into a CRASHING STOP, knocking over piles of GARBAGE. A SQUAD CAR barely clears the walls on either side, pursuing. It stops at a narrowing space, cops squeeze out either door, aiming GUNS. 
COP Freeze! STRICKLAND stumbles away from his bike, into an alcove. The cops approach, guns ready. STRICKLAND yanks off his helmet, pulls his ominous DEVICE from his pocket. Without poking his head out, he aims it in the cops direction. He PRESSES A BUTTON. A row of RED DIODES GLOW on the device as he sweeps it across the alley, but it emits no projectiles and makes no sound. COP #1 is closer-- his GLASS EYES SHATTER. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: COP #2 drops his weapon, staggers backward and falls, clutching his head. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK 
GREER has seen this, horrified. 
GREER Jesus, what is that? STRICKLAND is on the run again, scaling the fence. He hasn't spotted the chopper. GREER looks in the direction he's heading-- A HUGE CHAIN-LINK FENCE, topped with barbed wire, stretching across the whole city, just a hundred yards away. PORTRAITS of the PROPHET (the man we heard on the radio), long-haired and bearded, adorn the fence. There's a GATE, with two GUARDS checking those entering, one or two people are waiting. 
GREER (CONT'D) He gets through the gate, we can't touch him. GREER readies a RIFLE with a SCOPE, loads a TRANQUILIZER DART into the chamber. LOPEZ maneuvers to give Greer an angle out the chopper's side. 
EXT. SLUM ALLEY - DUSK 
STRICKLAND looks up to see GREER taking aim from the silent chopper. He leaps for cover behind a dumpster as-- GREER FIRES a DART, which RICOCHETS off the DUMPSTER. STRICKLAND scrambles around a corner. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK 
LOPEZ turns the bird forward to pursue, as GREER reloads. They round the corner. No sign of Strickland on the pavement. GREER looks to his left, beyond the PILOT-- STRICKLAND has scaled a fire escape, aiming the DEVICE right at Lopez. Greer sees what's about to happen-- 
GREER Please, I need your help... open the door! CAMERA MOVES through the RED-LIT room, to show the WIRES of a SENSORY PROJECTOR, a partial view of MAGGIE'S HEAD. 
INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
MAGGIE (her surrogate), in a tailored business suit, enters the apartment with BRIDGET, another gorgeous, high- fashion surrie in party clothes. They're laughing. 
BRIDGET --we're talking turquoise! I wouldn't carry a purse that color, much less a whole new skin. 
MAGGIE BRB, I just gotta change. Little black dress or red bustier? 
BRIDGET Bustier. 
INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/HALLWAY - NIGHT 
MAGGIE almost trips over GREER, unconscious on the floor. 
MAGGIE Oh my God. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT 
START ON a MAILBOX with the name "PETERS," as CARLIGHTS catch it. As the CAR turns up the dirt road in this rural area in the Rockies, it flips its LIGHTS OFF. 
INT. PETERS' HOUSE - NIGHT 
A pleasant, rustic home. JENNIFER PETERS, somewhat less perfect than her surrie, disconnects from her SENSORY PROJECTOR. She looks concerned, very tired. She rises from her stim chair and moves into a kitchen. PULL BACK - we're watching her through a WINDOW, with a very large and powerful-looking STALKER, LATER - PETERS in bed, fast asleep. A SHADOW crosses her doorway, but moves on. AT HER sensory PROJECTOR, the STALKER is SCANNING through her hard-drive's memory. ON SCREEN - fast-forwarding rapidly through PETERS' POV, we see GREER in the alley with the fallen SURRIES... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: THE STALKER, face illuminated by the screen's GLOW, looks expressionlessly toward Peters' bedroom, then back to the images. His eyes have a silvery, inhuman sheen. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. STRICKLAND'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Early morning. STRICKLAND sleeps fitfully in this gloomy, dingy space. He comes to, startles at the sight 
OF-- --a MAN sitting at the foot of his bed. He's very tall, imposing, bearded, dressed in black-- this is the PROPHET. Strickland is cowed, this isn't a man you get a lot of face time with. 
PROPHET You've been keeping secrets, Jack. TWO LARGE MEN now move into view, flanking the Prophet. Call them BUD and MILLER. They're scruffy, bearded, not surries. 
STRICKLAND No, Prophet, I--- 
PROPHET This is unfair to your brother humans. STRICKLAND tries to get out of bed, Bud pushes him down. 
STRICKLAND Please, I haven't done anything... 
PROPHET I know what you've done. What I don't know is-- who hired you to betray us? I want a name. 
STRICKLAND I-- I swear to God I don't know-- 
PROPHET Jack... 
STRICKLAND He never said his name, we talked on disposable cellphones-- I've never even seen his face! I couldn't tell you who he was if my life depended it! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: On the Prophet's disappointed, even sad expression... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
CLOSE ON A MEDICAL MONITOR - high-tech imaging of a HUMAN 
BRAIN. MOVE DOWN to find GREER (the real one), asleep. An IV, BLEEPING monitors. Uneaten LUNCH on a tray. MAGGIE, her surrogate that is, sits in a chair beside the bed, her hand resting on GREER's. He stirs-- she pulls her hand back, returns to her fashion magazine. A TV plays above his bed, Greer blinks, squints at this. ON TV - a small BOY CLIMBS a very tall TREE above a suburban sidewalk, pleasant MUSIC. Suddenly, a BRANCH BREAKS, the boy tumbles with a CRY. GREER winces distastefully. ON TV - now we see the BOY again, perfectly fine, standing beside his mother. She strokes his head with a smile. They look down at his broken SURROGATE on the ground beside the fallen BRANCH. 
COMMERCIAL V.0. Imagine a world where children are safe. Always... GREER, watching the screen, addresses Maggie. 
GREER Would you do that? 
AGAINST-- 
GREER None of us did! We still don't know. I don't think Strickland even knew-- he thought he was just taking down "the abominations." 
STONE I'm sorry, Greer,. but- - you're suspended, pending further action. Greer nods slowly, knew this was coming. PETERS takes a step back, looking on carefully. Greer takes his LAPTOP COMPUTER off the bedside table, opens it so that Stone can see it. 
GREER I've been going through my memory files of the crash... ever seen anything like this before? ON SCREEN - a magnified CLOSE-UP of the DEVICE in STRICKLAND'S HAND, as he points it upward at the helicopter. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) 
PETERS It's the murder weapon? GREER nods, STONE studies the laptop, sets his jaw. 
STONE It's more than that. It means nobody is safe. The Dreads want us all to be like them-- living in fear, no better than animals. And we've only just freed ourselves, begun to explore our true potential. 
GREER We need to get this guy. 
STONE We will. Our way of life will be protected, whatever it takes. An attractive SURRIE NURSE enters the room. 
NURSE Good news, Mr. Greer. The doctors say you can go home today. 
GREER (nervous, thrown) They said the end of the week-- 
NURSE Insurance, you know. She smiles, putting his clothing by the bed and disconnecting him from the IV and monitors. 
STONE Just take some time to heal. 
GREER What about my surrogate? 
STONE Hasn't been-recovered. I'm afraid we can't supply you with a new one until this matter is resolved. Peters, make sure he gets home in one piece. PETERS nods, looking at Greer sympathetically. GREER sinks back into his pillow, anxious. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (5) ON MEDICAL MONITOR - the image of GREER'S BRAIN shuts OFF with a BLIP. 
EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - DAY 
PETERS strides from the doors, GREER follows, dressed in casual clothes... then slows his pace, breathing hard. GREER'S POV - CARS zipping past on the street, RUSHING PEDESTRIANS, PARAMEDICS pushing a body past on a gurney. From Greer's now human perspective, surrogates seem artificial, appearance too perfect, eyes empty of souls. This should be reeling, vertiginous. PETERS pauses, seeing Greer is having a panic attack. He has trouble speaking. 
GREER I haven't been out without a surrogate in a long time... 
PETERS It's OK. Nothing's gonna happen. 
GREER They wanted to give me something for the anxiety... they call it corporeaphobia. 
PETERS Just take my arm. He shakes his head, takes a deep breath and moves out onto the sidewalk. Peters stays close. GREER'S POV - SURRIE PEDESTRIANS, moving quickly, seeming to come right. at him. One bumps into him-- GREER staggers, the surrie moves on as if he hasn't even noticed. Greer moves toward the curb to get away from them, stumbles-- PETERS has to pull him out of CAR TRAFFIC, a HORN HONKS. He's sweating, terrified. 
GREER Jesus Christ. 
PETERS We need to get you a replacement. She takes his arm forcibly and moves him away. 
EXT. SURROGATE DISCOUNT STORE - DAY 
A low-end place, BODIES displayed in the windows in their charging bays, SIGNS reading "HURRY 4 A SURRY! GIANT 
SALE! SYNTH UNITS NEW & USED!" PETERS guides GREER inside. 
INT. SURROGATE DISCOUNT STORE - DAY 
COFFIN-SIZED BOXES, SENSORY PROJECTORS and STIM CHAIRS stacked willy-nilly. BRIGHT LIGHTS, VIDEO SCREENS running PROMOS. A slick, blond Aryan SALESMAN approaches with a grin. He sizes GREER up, instantly recognizing signs of withdrawal. He speaks with an incongruous ASIAN 
ACCENT. 
SALESMAN Oh you poor guy-- out in just your skin can be scary. No worries, I got perfect surrie for you. He leads them deeper into the store. He wears a clip-on ID BADGE with the smiling face of a dark-haired ASIAN. RACKS OF ATTRACTIVE MALE and FEMALE BODIES, in skimpy BATHING SUITS-- differing heights and degrees of muscle. GREER looks these over. 
GREER I like to see my own face when I look in the mirror. 
SALESMAN Fine, you no buy off the rack-- we customize, on premise, less than one hour. As they move on, we glimpse CELEBRITY LOOK-ALIKES on the rack-- MARILYN MONROE and ELVIS PRESLEY. LATER - ON COMPUTER SCREEN, a 3-D RENDERING of GREER'S FACE rotates, shows EXPRESSIONS, smiles, frowns-- and speaks. A VOICE-PRINT runs below. 
GREER'S VOICE Hello. Testing-one-two-three... THE SALESMAN works the computer, GREER lies in an uncomfortable STIM CHAIR attached to a_SENSORY PROJECTOR, RED GOGGLES over his eyes and a CAMERA pointed at his face. He seems uneasy. PETERS looks on from nearby. 
PETERS I can get you home. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
GREER I'll be OK. He moves toward the door, she tags along. 
GREER (CONT'D) I'm thinking you should double- check Strickland's records, go back to the hard copies. See if you can find out why they dropped charges. 
PETERS You seem better already. 
GREER It's like riding a bike. 
EXT. METRO ENTRANCE - DAY 
subway, GREER and PETERS walk, he spots a sign for the changes direction to head for the escalator. 
PETERS Where you going? 
GREER It's a lovely day. Thought I'd take a trip to East Baltimore. He pauses at the top, a hit of vertigo. 
GREER (CONT'D) Was it always this steep? 
PETERS Jesus, Tom, the rez? 
GREER Since I'm stuck in my skin, I oughta take advantage of it. Hell, as long as Strickland has that device-- I'm safer this way. He clutches the handrail, starts moving down. 
PETERS Be careful. He nods and waves as he disappears down the escalator. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FBI BUILDING/LOBBY - DAY 
PETERS enters this large lobby, bustling with other AGENTS and OFFICIALS. She moves toward a DESK JOCKEY, security SCANNERS. She reacts to the sound of-- --SCREAMS and SCREECHING TIRES from outside the building. PETERS looks toward a large WINDOW to the street-- and immediately dives for cover as-- --a battered SUV, spray-painted with anti-surrogate GRAFFITI, SMASHES through the plate glass. SURRIE PEDESTRIANS are plastered across the grill and embedded in the windshield. THE SUV slams into a few SURRIES in the lobby, sends them flying or runs over them. It spins sideways into a WALL with the FBI SEAL overhead. The DRIVER leaps out, armed with a MACHINE GUN. He's clearly a DREAD, angry and deranged. He starts SHOOTING at anything that moves. PETERS crouches for cover as BULLETS shatter GLASS and smash MARBLE around her. An army of AGENTS burst from an elevator in Kevlar and riot helmets, armed with AUTOMATIC RIFLES. They instantly bring the DREAD down in a barrage of gunfire. The agents move to the DREAD'S BODY-- he's very dead, pouring BLOOD from dozens of bullet wounds. One speaks into his headset: 
RIOT AGENT Secure. 
(TO CROWD) Any biologicals here? 
CUT TO: 
INT. TAXICAB - DAY 
A SMALL FLAT-PANEL TV in the back of the CAB plays NEWS of the attack on the FBI building. PILES of surries removed on carts, one BODY on a stretcher. 
NEWS READER VOICE --twenty-seven surrogates irreparably damaged. Only one dead, the attacker himself. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NEWS READER VOICE (CONT'D) His motive is unclear at this point, but may be a response to the recent incident at the Baltimore human reservation... GREER, in the back seat, takes in this news grimly. The CABBIE has been glancing at his own monitor in front. 
CABBIE Goddamn Dreads... sure you don't wanna change your mind? 
GREER I'm sure. 
EXT. BALTIMORE SLUMS - DAY 
Late afternoon. GREER emerges from a TAXI near the same gate we saw earlier. Greer wobbles, steadies himself against the car as he pays the CABBIE-- a DRONE SURROGATE, built into the seat. 
CABBIE You OK, man? 
GREER Just a little carsick. The TAXI pulls away, Greer heads for the GATE. 
EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - DAY 
AT THE GATE: METAL SIGNS read "HUMANS ONLY - NO SURROGATES." GREER goes through a big,.old-fashioned (present-day) METAL DETECTOR, the light flashes GREEN. A DREAD GUARD waves him past. Greer gestures toward one of the many IMAGES OF THE PROPHET to be found in the rez. 
MILLER (CONT'D) Hurts, doesn't it. 
BUD It's a bitch being real. GREER lets out a primal CRY and lunges at MILLER, driving his head into the man's torso, knocking the wind out of him before the other two can pull Greer back. 
ADAMS I think he likes it. 
MILLER (catching his breath) So give him some more. Outnumbered three to one, Greer takes a beating, continues to throw mostly ineffective punches that just cause the men to redouble their efforts. Finally, he's limp in their arms. Miller plucks Greer's WALLET and BADGE from his pockets, examines them. As he does so, GREER spits BLOOD on the man's face. Miller seems about to whomp him again, but stops himself. 
MILLER (CONT'D) Not gonna give you the satisfaction. (to Bud and Adams) Get him out of here. Miller tosses Greer's ID at him, then moves toward the RV, leaving GREER gasping in the clutches of Bud and Adams, lit by the FLAMES from the funeral pyre. 
INT. PROPHET'S RV - NIGHT 
A spartan interior. MILLER enters. THE PROPHET stands with a couple of HANDLERS. 
HANDLER Trouble? 
MILLER Some fed named Greer, he wanted to talk to the Prophet. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HANDLER About that turkey shoot in DC? 
MILLER Didn't come up. Said they wanted Strickland's weapon. 
PROPHET Well, maybe I'll just have to bring it to their doorstep... In the Prophet's hand, we now see-- --the mysterious DEVICE with which Strickland killed his targets. 
EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - NIGHT 
GREER is half-dragged, half-carried, back the way he came, flanked by BUD and ADAMS. Greer sucks on his BLEEDING lip, works his tongue around in his mouth. He touches parts of his bruised body carefully. 
BUD Guy like you oughtn't be out in just your skin. 
GREER I'm starting to see your point. AT THE GATE - GREER leaves, trying to muster as much dignity as he can. The DREAD GUARD calls sarcastically after him. 
DREAD GUARD Come again real soon! 
EXT. BALTIMORE SLUMS - NIGHT 
GREER trudges along the seedy streets. He looks a mess-- torn clothing, bloodstains, bruises. Suddenly he's SHOVED from behind, falls to the pavement. 
WHEELS Oops. The assailant is a FREAK SURRIE-- extra ARMS, WHEELS where his feet should be. A moment later, Greer is surrounded by three rich, FREAKY 
TEENS. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: They've customized their surries in completely bizarre ways, in addition to the usual tattoos and piercings. Besides WHEELS, there's a hairless teen with six EYES scattered around his head. A GIRL has SPIKES sticking out of her skull and flesh and REPTILE SKIN. 
EYES Watch where you're going, meat. 
SPIKES What are you doin' off the rez? She bumps against GREER as he picks himself up, he shrinks from the spikes. She shoots a small blast of FLAME from her nostrils, then GIGGLES. 
GREER I'm not a Dread. 
WHEELS Then you oughta return that surrie, looks like shit. WHEELS comes at Greer again, Greer moves and TRIPS him-- but he just lands on an extra arm and rights himself. 
EYES Hey, it wants to play. EYES lowers his head and moves to butt him. GREER dodges, it looks like a bullfight. 
SPIKES Ole, toro! They turn, hearing a SCREECH OF TIRES. A LIMOUSINE has pulled up. A 10-year-old BOY climbs from the back and approaches. 
BOY Agent Greer. Would you like a ride? The kid's voice sounds like a child's, but with mature cadences to his speech. - 
WHEELS Check out Richie Rich. THE DRIVER of the Limo steps out-- it's ARMANDO from Canter's lobby. He lets his jacket fall open, revealing a HOLSTERED SIDEARM. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
ARMANDO We got a problem here? The FREAKS retreat with dirty looks. 
THE LIMO stops, a light RAIN now falling. GREER gets out and closes the door, the rear window rolls down. 
BOY/CANTER Somebody hired Strickland. You'll know who that is when you trace the weapon. 
GREER You really don't need to do my job for me. Boy/Canter takes in Greer's disheveled state. 
BOY/CANTER Yes, I can see you've got things under control. The limo pulls away. Greer pauses, looks up at the sky, letting the rain wash over his face. 
INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
AN ELECTRICAL ARC jumps from a GLASS TUBE to a MALE 
NOSTRIL. WIDER, the guy taking the jolt is a lanky male model named BRIAN. His face goes slack. ATMOSPHERIC MUSIC 
PLAYS. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MAGGIE and BRIDGET are squeezed together on the couch in Greer's apartment with BRIAN and a French hunk named ANDRE, who speaks with a slight ACCENT. Everyone is pretty high. Andre closes one eye, then the other, pupils turned inward. 
ANDRE Think my nose is too big... 
MAGGIE For what? 
ANDRE 
(SQUEEZING IT) I'm going to have it replaced. 
BRIDGET While you're at it-- I am so sick of twelve-inch dicks. MAGGIE chuckles. On the coffee table before them sits a small JACKER, like the one we saw in the underground club. The foursome pass a single ELECTRICAL TUBE around, attached by a cord to the device. Andre and Bridget have clearly coupled up, Brian touches Maggie's leg casually from time to time. 
ANDRE What do you want, we're men. 
BRIAN (coming out of it) Why is that? Why do we all have to be men and women? I'd rather be-- I dunno, a lion. Or an eagle. 
MAGGIE Mm. A spaceship. Or a cloud. 
BRIAN 
(BEAT) A cloud? Maggie shrugs. She lifts the hair from the nape of her neck, moves the GLASS TUBE there. Brian holds her close. The ELECTRICAL ARC-- MAGGIE gasps with pleasure, transported. A moment later, Andre notices that GREER has entered quietly during the above, staring at the foursome. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
ANDRE Don't look now. Some homeless meatbag just wandered in. Maggie has blanked out for the moment. Bridget turns. 
BRIDGET That's Maggie's husband. Hi Tom. She gives him a little wave. Greer moves past them, toward the kitchen, and disappears. Maggie comes out of her trance, blinks and sighs. 
MAGGIE Excuse me. She hurries after him. Brian shrugs, grabs the tube and starts to unzip his pants-- 
INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - NIGHT 
GREER has removed an old, yellowed FIRST-AID KIT from under the sink, during the scene he cleans up cuts, opens his shirt to check his bruised ribs, etc. 
MAGGIE What happened to you? I thought you were-spending another night in the hospital. 
GREER Obviously. You know I don't like you jacking in the house. He finds an untouched, dusty bottle of SCOTCH, sniffs it and pours a drink. Maggie looks him over. 
MAGGIE Somebody beat you up? How could you go out like that? As Maggie speaks, she moves to his side, touching his injuries gently, truly concerned. Greer flinches back. 
MAGGIE (CONT'D) What were you thinking, Tom? You. could've been killed. 
GREER Just finding out how the other half lives. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Greer takes a long drink, gestures toward the living room. 
GREER (CONT'D) So what's his name? 
MAGGIE Oh please, grow up. 
CONTINUED: He passes the SURRIE SCANNER and holds his hand over a FINGERPRINT MACHINE, which confirms his identity. A plexiglas door unlocks automatically. 
DESK JOCKEY Says here you're on suspension. 
GREER Mm. Just cleaning out my desk. 
DESK JOCKEY 
(EYING HIM) Y'know, you're thinner on top. 
GREER Nice of you to notice. You remember where the rest rooms are? 
DESK JOCKEY They mostly use 'em for storage. Think the one on four still works. Greer nods and continues in. 
INT. FBI BUILDING/CHARGING ROOM - NIGHT 
DOZENS of SURROGATE AGENTS are lined up against the wall in here, in their foam CHARGING BAYS. CAMERA FINDS PETERS in their midst. Her bay HUMS and she blinks, becomes animated. She steps out of the bay. 
INT. FBI BUILDING/GREER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
GREER has his feet up on his desk, the bottle beside him. There are cardboard BOXES of DOCUMENTS nearby. PETERS enters, Greer looks up at her. 
PETERS Got your message. 
GREER Hope I didn't wake you. 
PETERS After what happened here today I couldn't sleep. 
GREER You tell anyone I was going out to the rez? Canter, for example? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PETERS 
(TAKEN ABACK) No. Of course not. Greer studies her a beat, decides she's sincere. A sigh. Peters sits on his desk, studies him. 
PETERS (CONT'D) You look terrible. 
GREER Not half as bad as I feel. Greer refills his coffee cup with Scotch, holds the bottle out to her questioningly. 
PETERS No thanks. 
GREER Come on. Just pretend to get drunk with me. Peters shakes her head with a smile. Greer shrugs, takes a long drink, sighs and rubs his sore neck. 
GREER (CONT'D) Feel like I've been asleep for years-- now I wake up an old man. Rip Van Frigging Winkle... Peters moves behind him, begins rubbing his shoulders, a massage. 
GREER (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
PETERS You look like you need it. 
GREER I'm not sure how kosher this is... 
PETERS Relax. It's not me, it's not a woman touching you-- it's just a machine. 
GREER Does feel good... better than a stim chair. He allows himself to enjoy it for a moment, bows his head. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
GREER (CONT'D) You ever feel like it's... over? 
PETERS What. 
GREER Us. People. The stuff that used to make the world make sense. That made us... human. I don't know, morality, love. Whatever. 
(BEAT) Yeah, yeah, they were probably saying that back in ancient Rome. 
PETERS We always think technology's going to improve our lives, but... 
BRANDON At the flick of a switch. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BEAUTY SHOP - DAY 
CLOSE on a WOMAN'S FACE being carefully peeled off the MECHANICAL UNDERPINNINGS. FUNKY MUSIC plays. WIDER, BRIDGET leans over the body, putting the old face aside. A row of EXOTIC NEW FACES on a rack nearby. Bridget begins manipulating the underlying musculature, changing cheekbones, etc, using delicate TOOLS. 
BRIDGET She wanted blue eyes the size of golf balls, bee-sting lips and a tiny ski-jump nose... 
MAGGIE Boop-oop-a-doop. 
BRIDGET Exactly. Nearby, MAGGIE works on a brown-skinned HAND. She stares through a mounted MAGNIFYING LOUPE, embedding tiny JEWELS in the SKIN of the fingers. She uses TWEEZERS and a tiny BLOWTORCH. After a moment, we realize the HAND has been disconnected from the body, mounted on a brace. 
MAGGIE You talked her down, I hope. 
BRIDGET Yes, thank God, we're doing a modified Audrey Hepburn. MAGGIE glances over at Bridget's work admiringly. 
MAGGIE I'd love you to raise my cheekbones a half-inch, but Tom would go ballistic. THE DOOR CHIMES, Bridget looks up. 
BRIDGET Speaking of the ball and chain... As GREER approaches, a few of the BEAUTY ENGINEERS glance up, then return to their business. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: This place is a cross between a beautician's and an auto body repair shop. SURRIES in chairs that maneuver into all kinds of positions. Not only are they having nails and hair done, but legs lengthened, breasts enlarged, etc. (Operators check in their bodies and leave them there for modifications.) 
BRIDGET (CONT'D) Hiya, Tom. 
MAGGIE I didn't hear you come home last night. 
GREER Worked late. I'd really like to sit down and talk with you. 
MAGGIE I can take a break-- 
GREER No, Maggie, face to face. The two of us, for real. BRIDGET is getting uncomfortable. 
BRIDGET These smile muscles need to set. She exits with a look at Maggie. Maggie stops working and turns to Greer, speaks passionately. 
MAGGIE Tom, don't you get it? That body in our apartment-- the one you call real--- it isn't me. I'm right here. 
GREER Honey, if you're worried about the way you look-- it doesn't matter, it never did-- 
MAGGIE Exactly! What matters is who I choose to be. As the conversation gets more heated, co-workers pointedly turn away, while eavesdropping. 
GREER I married a person, you're choosing to be a thing. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
GREER (CONT'D) And I'm so sick of being surrounded by things-- young, beautiful things. 
MAGGIE Well that's your problem, isn't it. if you can be young and beautiful and feel good all the time-- why would anyone choose anything else? 
GREER Because it's bullshit. Because we're human, like it or not. 
MAGGIE Jesus, Tom. You sound like a Dread. Maggie turns back to what she was doing. Greer has trouble swallowing his anger. 
GREER I may just have to kick down your bedroom door. 
MAGGIE (not looking up) I'd never forgive you. 
GREER Then maybe I should just move out. 
MAGGIE Do what you want... 
GREER 
(A BEAT) That's a commercial. Greer turns and exits. Maggie glances after him with a mixture of anger and regret, then returns to her work. 
GREER Guy at VSI. You looking forward to moving to the private sector--? Nakata is listening curiously. Stone angrily gestures for Greer to come into his office, he doesn't want to have this conversation in public. Greer keeps speaking as he heads inside. 
GREER (CONT'D) Will you finish out the year? We're sure gonna miss you around here... STONE SLAMS the door. 
INT. FBI BUILDING/STONE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Greer keeps speaking calmly, as if there were no tension in the air. 
GREER I know it's hard to resist, better hours, better pay-- 
STONE Welch told you about this? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GREER (beat, grins) No. I was just fishing. 
STONE You've suffered brain damage, Greer. Let's hope it isn't permanent. 
GREER 
(GRIN FADING) All surveillance on the Prophet goes through this office. Jack Strickland was one of your stoolies. Why the hell didn't you say something? STONE just stares at him, narrowing his eyes. 
GREER (CONT'D) Two cops died. You knew he had the 
0. D.-- 
STONE I have no idea what you're talking 
ABOUT-- 
GREER --because you gave it to him. VSI makes them-- they hand one to you-- and you chose the trigger man. Your own little black op. If anyone looks, they blame the Dreads. But Strickland didn't follow the plan, did he? He didn't give you back the 0. D. like he was supposed to. 
STONE Are you done with this paranoid fantasy--? 
GREER Not quite. What I can't figure out is why. Why kill Canter? STONE stares at Greer, angry and defiant. He moves to his desk, types into his COMPUTER. Greer approaches slowly. 
STONE I'm issuing orders for your detention. Your mind isn't right, you've become a threat to national security. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) Greer slips a LETTER OPENER off of Stone's desk as he nears. His hand is SHAKING. Suddenly-- --STONE yanks open a DRAWER and lunges for a GUN. But before he can bring it to bear-- --GREER STABS him in the back of the head, SKEWERING STONE'S CPU. STONE FREEZES, hunched over his desk, gun in hand. Greer just stares at what he's done for a moment, amazed. Then he waves a hand in front of Stone's open eyes, makes sure he's out, and-- --carefully pries off a plate and removes STONE'S MOTHERBOARD, places it on the desk. GREER pulls the gun out of Stone's hand, rolls him back in front of his desk, propped up to face the computer. Greer crouches behind him, operating the keyboard by reaching around his boss' body. ON COMPUTER - Greer types in a request for a FILE on LIONEL CANTER. The words "CLASSIFIED - IDENTITY SCAN REQUIRED" appear. GREER pushes the chair a bit closer to the computer, ducking down, lifts Stone's head by the hair. The monitor momentarily displays STONE'S FACE. A LIGHT goes on in the corner of the FRAME, scanning Stone. "AUTHORIZED USER" appears. GREER peeks up again, continuing his work. ON SCREEN - a HEADSHOT OF CANTER, reams of CLASSIFIED INFO. Greer hits PRINT. 
INT. FBI BUILDING/BULLPEN - DAY 
GREER emerges, a stack of PAPERS in his hand. He gives a nod to NAKATA, who nods back as he answers his RINGING PHONE. Before he can even say a word: 
STONE (FILTER) This is Stone! Nakata looks toward the office, starting to rise. 
NAKATA What do you need, sir? 
INT. STONE'S STUDY - DAY 
Upscale. The REAL STONE, a good deal heavier than his surrogate, is sitting in boxer shorts at the edge of his STIM CHAIR, a phone in his hand. 
STONE Sonofabitch Greer disabled my surrie, stop him! 
INT. FBI BUILDING/STAIRWELL - DAY 
GREER takes a couple steps at a time. He's on his phone. 
GREER Just meet me in the garage-- leave the trunk open! As he rounds a corner, he comes face to face with-- --a pair of AGENTS, each carrying a HANDGUN. They approach from below. 
AGENT #1 Tom, we don't want to hurt you. Greer nods and raises his hands, resigned-- he still clutches the papers. As Agent #1 nears, Greer suddenly-- --PLANTS a FOOT in the man's chest, sending him crashing into AGENT #2. Both men topple down the stairs, FIRE their guns wildly. Greer has also lost his balance and dropped some papers, which he has to scoop up as he claws for the. doorway and dashes through. 
INT. FBI BUILDING/PARKING GARAGE - DAY 
PETERS waits near an IDLING SEDAN, the TRUNK OPEN. Greer dives inside, she SLAMS it and gets behind the wheel. She PEELS out, going up a few levels. AT AN EXIT GATE - an FBI GUARD looks inside. 
FBI GUARD They're looking for Tom Greer. You seen him? She shakes her head, he presses a button to open the gate and waves her through. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
GREER Can't bring him back. 
PETERS 
(ENRAGED) They will come after Canter again-- but you're just going to deposit your pension checks, look the other way and let him die. 
GREER (looks at her) Maybe he's got it coming. 
PETERS 
(BETRAYED) I thought you were a cop. I thought you were a human being. PETERS marches out of there and slams the door on the way out. GREER waits a few moments, his mind racing-- then he moves for the door himself. 
INT. RENTAL AGENCY - DAY 
GREER moves from a desk with a pretty RENTAL AGENT, working at a small hand-held COMPUTER. LOGOS for GLOBAL 
SYNTH RENTALS. 
RENTAL AGENT Our nearest rental office is just outside Denver, the car and phone will be extra-- 
GREER I'm only gonna be there a couple hours. She leads him toward a curtained BOOTH, one of many here. RED GLOWS emanate from a few. 
RENTAL AGENT Do you want to customize--? 
GREER Generic's fine. She pulls back a CURTAIN to reveal a STIM-CHAIR and a 
SENSORY PROJECTOR. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RESERVATION TEMPLE -- DAY 
THE PROPHET stands with a MIC before a LARGE CROWD packed into the place, sounds of CHAOS from outside. GUARDSMEN are moving into the temple, methodically searching those inside. - 
PROPHET Have no fear, the day of resurrection is at hand! A team of GUARDSMEN move to surround the Prophet, his BODYGUARDS struggle with them. 
PROPHET (CONT'D) No! Do not resist! The oppressors shall soon fall, never to rise again... Ignoring him, some bodyguards pull HANDGUNS and FIRE on the SURROGATE GUARDSMEN, who immediately RETURN FIRE with automatic weapons. BUD and MILLER, the Prophet's right hand men, both take bullets and go down. THE PROPHET manages to escape out a side exit during this gunfire-- but a stray BULLET catches him in the back as he flees. 
EXT. RESERVATION TEMPLE - DAY 
As he runs from the building, the PROPHET is TACKLED by a GUARDSMAN. He turns the man over, the Prophet's eyes are empty, his head lolls back. A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM from nearby as a YOUNG FEMALE DREAD takes this in. 
YOUNG DREAD They've killed him! They've killed the Prophet! Other DREADS nearby react, the CRY spreading. WITH THE GUARDSMAN, examining the body. The Prophet is already rigid... and GREEN COOLANT is spreading from an exit wound in his chest. A guardsman rips open his shirt, pokes at the wound-- ELECTRONICS and TORN PLASTIC. THE GUARDSMAN's amazed, gets on his WALKIE-TALKIE. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GUARDSMAN Captain, you'd better come see this. Nearby Guardsmen react to the furious DREADS massing around them. A GRENADE LANDS nearby, GUARDSMAN #2 throws himself on it, his SURRIE BLOWS UP. GUNFIRE ERUPTS nearby, a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL sails through the air. 
GUARDSMAN #3 We need to clear out! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY 
Late in the afternoon. Rolling green hills, trees, a rural area. A white COMPACT CAR pulls up a dirt road, past the MAILBOX with "PETERS" painted on it. 
EXT. PETERS' HOUSE - DAY 
THE COMPACT pulls to a stop. GENERIC/GREER climbs out of the car. He's blandly handsome, in a business suit, with perfect hair that looks glued in place. His movements are stilted, this is a cheap model and he's not used to it. GENERIC/GREER steps onto the porch, knocks on the door. No answer. He tries the knob-- locked. 
INT. RENTAL AGENCY/BOOTH - DAY 
MATCH-CUT POV of PETERS' DOOR on a SENSORY PROJECTOR 
SCREEN. REAL GREER in a rental stim-chair, bathed in RED LIGHT. His face twitches slightly, as if having a bad dream.

(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
REAL PETERS (CONT'D) He took my memory-- the whole investigation. He said he was going to do my job for me. A beat. Their eyes meet as the realization hits Generic/Greer. 
GENERIC/GREER (under his breath) Canter. 
REAL PETERS It has to be... oh God, I'm so cold... She clearly had been fighting to stay alive, just to tell someone what happened. 
REAL PETERS (CONT'D) Would've been nice to meet you in person... She now closes her eyes. Greer agonizes. 
GENERIC/GREER Peters, hang on, please-- it won't be long... He rises, finds an old blanket to put around her. 
REAL PETERS Thirsty... 
INT. PETERS' KITCHEN - NIGHT 
GENERIC/GREER quickly fills a glass of water from the tap. He hears SIRENS in the distance as he hurries back into the basement. 
INT. PETERS' BASEMENT - NIGHT 
GENERIC/GREER kneels down to dribble water on REAL PETERS' partially open lips. We hear a VEHICLE ARRIVE outside. 
GENERIC/GREER They'll be here in just a minute... No response. He brushes her hair back from her face-- REAL PETERS' eyes are half-open, vacant. She's dead. GENERIC/GREER lets out an anguished CRY. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ANGLE UP STAIRS - SURRIE PARAMEDICS rush down with a STRETCHER. They take in the sight of-- TWO MOTIONLESS BODIES. PETERS, dead... and l ass lass GENERIC/GREER, kneeling over her body, head bowed, g still in hand-- checked out. 
CUT TO: 
TNT. RENTAL AGENCY - DAY REAL GREER comes out of the curtained booth in a hurry, moving for the door. He's talking on the phone. 
GREER Who's on duty in surveillance--? Sanders, great, put me through-- He's pursued by the RENTAL AGENT. 
RENTAL AGENT Sir, sir, sir-- you haven't returned your unit-- Greer ignores the woman, he's out of there. She calls after him angrily. 
RENTAL AGENT (CONT'D) You signed a contract! 
EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY 
A handful of DREADS are storming down the street, SMASHING WINDOWS and bowling over any SURRIES who get in their way. A SCROLLING ELECTRONIC NEWS CRAWL on the side of a building: "PROPHET SHOT, REPORTED DEAD..." GREER is walking fast, on the phone, steering clear of the angry Dreads. 
GREER It's an emergency, you need to connect me now! 
INT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY 
TIGHT ON BOBBY, the overweight controller, at his station. He looks nervous, wearing his HEADSET. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Responding to a subtle BEEP in his ear,-he makes as if to scratch himself, opening the connection. We hear GREER'S 
FILTERED VOICE: 
GREER (FILTER) Bobby, it's Greer, I need a remote shutdown. You'll have the surrie's digital address on file, Agent Jennifer Peters. CAMERA MOVES to reveal that PETERS (the surrie) is holding BOBBY at GUNPOINT, a grim expression on her face. She doesn't realize Bobby's on the phone. 
GREER (FILTER) (CONT'D) Hello? Bobby, are you there? Bobby looks toward the special TERMINAL that displays the surrie serial numbers. NUMBERS are cranking through fast, ALL HIGHLIGHTING. Bobby looks at Peters, but speaks for Greer's benefit. 
BOBBY Peters, have you gone insane? Put the gun away, what the hell are you trying to prove? PETERS ignores him, watching the TERMINAL SCREEN. WIDER now, we see that all the SURRIE WATCHERS have disconnected, they're stationary on their tracks. THE GLOWING MONITORS remain on, showing random scenes, unwatched. MOVEMENT at the elevated entrance-- --PETERS spins and FIRES HER HANDGUN in that direction. The intruder retreats. We now see a couple of SURRIES have already been dropped here, sprawled on the staircase leading down, bullets in their heads. PETERS spins on Bobby, who's WHISPERING frantically into 
HIS HEADSET: 
BOBBY (CONT'D) She's into the entire surrie database, I dunno what she's-- Peters YANKS off Bobby's headset and throws it aside. 
EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY 
GREER has stopped, stunned. Then, realizing what's happening, he takes off at a sprint in a different direction. He makes another call: 
(CONTINUED) 
PETERS/GREER This can really send a virus to every surrie on the network? 
BOBBY Sure, but it has to disconnect the operators first. 
PETERS/GREER (pauses, surprised) So people aren't in any danger... 
BOBBY Their surrogates are! Hurry up! 
ON TERMINAL SCREEN - "ABORT? YES. NO." 
INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/CONTROL AREA - DAY 
THE PROJECTOR SCREEN shows the words "YES. NO." MOVE TO GREER, in the sensory projector, his face tight. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: CANTER stares at GREER, seeing that Greer realizes what's at stake-- the fate of humanity. 
CANTER You understand... 
INT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY 
PETERS/GREER reaches for the keyboard again, hesitates. A moment of internal conflict. BOBBY stares, confused. 
BOBBY Do it! BANG! A CLEAN HEADSHOT drops PETERS/GREER in her tracks, ELECTRONIC GOO sprays the COMPUTER SCREEN. BOBBY spins in his chair. 
BOBBY (CONT'D) 
NOT He tries desperately to reach the keys himself, but-- ON SCREEN "DISCONNECTING." He's too late. 
INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/CONTROL AREA - DAY 
GREER yanks off the headset, breathing hard, eyes wide with shock. CANTER regards him from his wheelchair. He's been watching the MONITOR, knows what just happened. 
CANTER You could have stopped it. Thank you... 
GREER Why...? 
CANTER You know why. I won't be responsible for the death of humanity. I like the way you put it-- unringing a bell. GREER puts his head in his hands, realizing the enormity of what he's just done. 
GREER You created them. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CANTER I only sought to give people like me the chance to live normal lives. But my partners at VSI overrode me. They saw a much larger market-- surrogates for everyone. Healthy people. Children. A world without risk, without pain. Without feelings. Nothing at stake. Nothing to live for. Greer rises shakily. 
GREER What's going to happen? 
CANTER The day of resurrection. As he speaks, he raises a small white capsule to his lips. 
GREER No--! Before Greer can stop him, CANTER BITES INTO IT and swallows. Greer tries to get the capsule from Canter's mouth-- but the man is DEAD within moments. 
INT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY 
BOBBY KICKS at the COMPUTER frantically, CRYING OUT. THE SNIPER reaches him, CUTS his HANDS free with a KNIFE.

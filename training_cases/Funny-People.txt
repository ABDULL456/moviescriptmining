INT. BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT 
GEORGE SIMMONS, 42, sits in a giant living room watching bad television on a 70-inch flat screen TV. He looks bored and empty. After a few beats he pauses the TV, and picks up the phone. 
GEORGE (on the phone) Hey, it's George Simmons, I'm coming in. 
INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 
Shots of George doing stand up on stage at a comedy club. The place adores him. We see quick images of him after the show interacting with people. He is clearly a very famous comedian. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
George has sex with a girl in her early twenties. 
INT. BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT 
George sits back down, the thrill of his performance is gone, he is bored and alone again. He hits play on his TV and begins watching his show from the same spot it was at before.

INT. BEL AIR HOME - BEDROOM - DAY 
GEORGE wakes up in a large, clean, modern house. He is all alone. We get the feeling that he hired someone to decorate his house. It is very nice, but doesn't seem personal to him at all. It feels new, with all the gadgets, but a little cold. On the kitchen table is a stack of scripts he is supposed to read. 
EXT. GEORGE'S HOME - MORNING 
George hits balls in his home batting cage. Then we see him driving golf balls inside there. In the background we see his modern, space ship looking house. It is enormous. 
INT. BATHROOM - LATER 
George walks into a fancy, steam-filled shower. 
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 
George drives his large black Mercedes. 
EXT. MEDICAL TOWER - DAY 
George gets out of his car and walks towards the tower. Two COLLEGE STUDENTS walk over. 
COLLEGE STUDENT Hey George, can I get a picture with you? 
GEORGE Sure buddy. Let's do it. One of the college students put his arm around George while the other takes the picture. 
COLLEGE STUDENT #2 Can I get one? 
GEORGE Yeah bud. They take the picture. 
COLLEGE STUDENT You're the man. We love all your movies, even the last one. 
GEORGE Thanks. Tell your friends. 
INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY 
George sits in the doctor's office staring at the photos of the doctor with his beautiful young children. DOCTOR STEVENS enters and sits down. He takes a deep breath. 
GEORGE I like those lunestas. They really put me to sleep without giving me the sleeping pill hangover I get from the restorils. 
(MORE) 
GEORGE (COIN ' D ) 
(BEAT) I try not to take them too often. Just when I know I have to get up early. 
DOCTOR STEVENS George there are some irregularities in your blood work... George's face turns white. He knows what this means. The doctor keeps talking but the sound keeps coming in and out-- it is now all a jumble of words. 
ANGLE ON GEORGE'S POV We see photos of the doctor's family, his graduation certificates, files of other cases, odd doctor's office art, a picture of him skiing with his family. He keeps talking, but now we hear nothing. MUSIC UP - "MY SHIT's FUCKED UP" BY WARREN ZEVON 
END CREDIT SEQUENCE 
INT. IRA'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Ira sits with one of his roommates, LEO, who is also an aspiring comedian. They sit across from each other, kicking around joke ideas they have, trying to write new ones. We see an entire pitch session play out. Ira's joke pitches are all over the place. He clearly hasn't figured out what his stage persona is yet. 
IRA I was thinking about doing something about how I'm not good looking and I'm not bad looking. I'm just good looking enough that if I had a good personality, it could put me over the top. If that was the case. 
LEO Yeah, something about how the uglier you are, the better the personality you need. And the hotter you are, the stupider you can be. 
IRA I had a joke once about how you never see incredibly hot, blonde, homeless women. Because someone will always take care of that kind of woman. That woman could be the dumbest person on earth and she will survive in this world. 
LEO Maybe something like... you can be hot and stupid and survive in the world. And you can be smart and ugly and survive in the world. The people who have trouble are the stupid, ugly people. 
IRA That could work. 
LEO Let me keep that one, because I thought of most of it. 
IRA That's not cool. I came up with the concept! What do you got? Let's work on what you have. 
LEO I've got nothing in the notebook. I got drunk last night. But I need material, because I just got spots at the Improv. Budd saw me and approved me. I'm in. 
IRA How could they make you a regular? I got turned down twice. 
LEO Sorry, man. They're only going to let in one chubby, caustic Jew, so I think you're fucked. Their other roommate, MARK, walks in, waves a check at them. 
MARK Hey, dudes. You see this check that I got from my TV show for 25,000 an episode? There was another one of these on the kitchen counter. Did you see it? 
IRA No we didn't see it. Just don't leave those things laying around. 
MARK I wouldn't leave it around if they didn't give me so many. They give it to me every episode. 
LEO Don't throw it in our face that you're on a shitty show. 
MARK I wouldn't, if it was a shitty show and not what Time magazine called "insightful and delightful." 
IRA I thought you were moving out. 
MARK I decided I like it here. Living with you guys keeps me grounded. I don't want to be the guy living in the house on the hill. Even though I could afford it. Hey, I saw that girl comic you like who lives upstairs. I invited her in. She's here. 
IRA She's in our apartment? I've never even talked to her. I just gave her quarters at the washing machine. 
MARK You were right, she is pretty mousy and sexy. You gotta talk to her. 
IRA I need time. I have a three-month plan. 
MARK I'll give you ten days for your three-month plan, then I am going to fuck her. You can't just leave that laying around. Starting right now. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Mark is talking to DAISY, an alternative-feeling, dark-haired girl in her early twenties. His television show is on the 
TV. 
MARK The thing about working on a sitcom is it's 22 weeks a year, so I can do stand-up the rest of the year. 
(MORE) 
MARK (CONT'D) But now people want to see me because they see me on a TV show, so I am kind of a draw. Have you seen the show? 
DAISY I don't own a TV. 
MARK Well I think you can download it to an iPod. Ira walks in. 
MARK (CONT'D) Hey Ira, this is Daisy. 
DAISY how's it going? 
IRA Nice to meet you. I think I gave you quarters once. Ira walks over to the kitchen area, takes out a paper cup. He pours some orange juice without looking and the paper cup falls over and spills all over the counter. Mark looks horrified. 
IRA (CONT'D) (nervously joking) Don't worry, I'll just lick it off the counter. Nobody laughs. Ira starts wiping up the OJ with a rag. 
INT. COMEDY AND MAGIC CLUB - NIGHT 
Leo is on stage, performing his act, doing well. ANGLE ON Ira watching, both amused and jealous. A MAGICIAN and the EMCEE walks over to him. 
EMCEE Schneider didn't show up so, you can do ten minutes after Leo. 
GEORGE It's George. 
IRA Oh my gosh. Hey, how is it going? 
GEORGE I thought you and Leo were pretty funny last night and I have to do this corporate gig for Apple computers in a couple of days and I thought you guys could write me some jokes. 
IRA Definitely. What kind of jokes? Leo passes by in the background. We see Ira decide not to include him in this job offer. 
GEORGE I don't know, about computers and shit. I could mainly do my act but they like it if you talk about them a little. 
IRA No problem. Where do you want me to send em? 
GEORGE What is your email? I will send you my fax and email and all that. 
IRA It's a...irasexiraÃÂ®gmail.com. 
GEORGE (long silence) I almost just changed my mind. You got to change that. 
IRA Ok. 
GEORGE Today. Seriously. Ok. Later. Ira hangs up and turns to his friends. 
IRA That was George Simmons. He wants me to write jokes for him. 
LEO Holy shit. That is awesome. You are so lucky. 
MARK Are you gonna get to meet him? 
IRA I don't know, but he is gonna send me his email address. 
LEO We are gonna have his email address? I have to send him the link to my short. 
IRA Easy. Let me get in there a little more. 
CUT TO: 
INT. IRA'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Ira is writing jokes. The camera follows the letters being typed on the computer screen as he types. "Always erase your web history. I had a girlfriend hit history and see eleven hundred porn sites that I visited in an hour." Jonah sticks his head in. 
LEO I got one, but you have to tell him its mine. The best thing about Leopard is it lets you watch a porno, write a porno, shoot a porno, and order a porno all at the same time. And you guys made that possible. We see QUICK IMAGES of him typing and printing. He is writing an enormous amount of jokes. Way more than George will ever need. Writing, typing, re-writing in pen, then re- typing, etc. Ira hesitates, then hits send. 
INT. IRA'S BEDROOM 
Ira is asleep. The clock says noon. The phone rings. He answers it, groggy. 
GEORGE There's some funny shit in here. Not a bad ratio of good jokes to shit. 
IRA Thanks man. I just want to give you a lot of choices. 
GEORGE Too many choices. I don't like reading that much. I need like ten good jokes. I'm a little mad you made me read that many to get to ten. But thanks for doing it. 
IRA Oh, it was fun to try to write in your voice. I spent the whole night pretending I was you. 
GEORGE So you cried yourself to sleep? 
(ALT) So you whacked off three times last night? Don't worry, I'll get you some money. Is five hundred good? 
IRA Yeah! That'll work. 
GEORGE I'm leaving at four tomorrow to go to the gig. You want to come check it out, see if your shit works? 
INT. IRA'S APARTMENT 
CLOSE-UP on their curtains, as they wait for George to pull up. 
LEO Can we go outside and meet him? 
IRA No you can't. Because then we look like fans. 
MARK Maybe he's seen my show. 
IRA He doesn't watch your show. You're show is for eight-year-olds. It's a family show, he doesn't watch that shit. 
LEO I'll just go outside and pretend I'-,n washing my car. The Limo pulls up outside. 
LEO (CONT'D) Holy shit. I feel like my little girl is going to the prom. 
-- George focuses on Mandy, flirting and preparing her to go home with him. -- The other girl is now talking to a very uncomfortable Ira. She is not into it. 
GEORGE Hey, let's all go back to my house. 
MANDY Great! 
IRA 
(HOPEFUL) Yeah, that sounds like a... nice idea. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
Music is playing. Everybody is drinking. Mandy is doing some weird sort of sexy dance for George. 
MANDY This house is so big. It's bigger than the college I went to. 
GEORGE Oh there's a whole other wing that you wouldn't even know existed unless you went through this door. 
MANDY I want to see, I want to see. George and Mandy disappear. Ira and Dawn are left alone. 
IRA You are very pretty. 
DAWN I have a boyfriend. Nothing is going to happen. 
IRA I didn't say anything was going to happen. I just said you were pretty. How do you even know I wanted something to happen? 
DAWN I hope she doesn't take a long time. 
INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
George is having sex with Mandy. 
MANDY I can't believe I'm having sex with Davey! 
GEORGE He can't believe he's having sex with you. 
INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Ira and Dawn are watching one of George's films. Neither looks very happy or comfortable. George enters. 
GEORGE Hey, Mandy thought you left, so she left. 
DAWN Really? 
GEORGE Sorry, that kind of stuff happens when you have a big house. 
DAWN Oh, well then I guess I better get going? 
GEORGE You don't have to go. I'm just saying that she left. I think she left her purse in the other wing. Come with me, let's go get it. Ira watches this, astonished. 
GEORGE (CONT' D ) Did Ira tell you I have a room with all the classic pinball machines and video games? 
DAWN That sounds awesome. 
GEORGE Yeah, I got Galaga. Let's go check it out. 
George looks over his shoulder at Ira, as if to say, "A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do." 
GEORGE (CONT'D) (to Ira) Hey don't go, I'll be back in a second. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER 
Ira is now watching the end of the movie by himself. George sticks his head in. 
GEORGE That girl left. You want to talk to me while I try to go to sleep. Ira doesn't know what to make of this. 
IRA I guess so. 
INT. BEDROOM - LATER 
George is in bed under the covers, comfortably laying on his pillow. Ira sits in an easy chair located right next to the bed. 
IRA Did you have sex with both of those girls? 
GEORGE I'm afraid I did. I'm sorry. It was just so clear that you were not going to get it done. I figured you wouldn't mind. 
IRA That is crazy. That is super crazy. 
GEORGE Well it's easier with you because I don't know you. I don't feel weird around you. I don't want to be treated like a guy who's going to die. 
IRA I don't know, man. I don't think you want to go through this alone. I think you've got to tell people. Your family. Your friends. 
GEORGE Actually, the reason why I only told you is I need you to do me a favor. 
IRA What? Anything, man. 
GEORGE I can't imagine suffering through the final stages of this. So...I was going to ask you if you would be willing...to euthanize me. 
IRA What does that mean? 
GEORGE Kill me. I figured if I found someone that nobody knew that was a stranger, they could get away with it, and I wouldn't have to suffer. I got a gun that is untraceable. And a silencer. And I thought maybe tonight, I would take a bunch of sleeping pills, and when I slept you would put a bullet in my head. 
IRA I can't do that! 
GEORGE I'll give you fifty thousand dollars in cash. You'd be doing me a favor. It would be the kindest thing you could ever do for somebody. 
IRA Fifty thousand dollars? Can I at least take a little time to think about it? 
GEORGE Holy shit, you would do it. You were literally thinking about doing it! 
IRA You're an asshole. 
GEORGE I'm an asshole, you were about to kill me. For fifty grand! That's not even a lot of money. 
IPA I just got nervous so I was delaying saying no. 
GEORGE You basically just told me that you were willing to be a murderer. While you're cooking me eggs. 
IRA That's not cool, man. You told me you're going to die and you want me to euthanize you. I almost had a heart attack. 
GEORGE Well, I actually am sick. And I'm not going to survive. 
IRA Don't do this. My friends do this all the time. They trick me, and then they trick me again. I'm very gullible. Don't do it. 
GEORGE I'm not putting you on, man. Just don't tell anyone. I mean that. I don't want people to know about this. I don't want to feel weird. Ira nods okay. 
IRA Are you religious? Does that give you any comfort? 
GEORGE Do you really think I'm going to sit here and have a theological conversation with you? 
IRA No. 
GEORGE Maybe later, Father Mulcahy. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER 
The three friends - Mark, Ira, Leo - smoke pot and have what they think is a deep conversation. 
MARK That's so sad. 
LEO If it was me, I would tell everyone. Then everyone would kiss my ass. And take care of me. Tell me how much they love me. 
(MORE) 
LEO (CONT`D) Wipe my ass when I had to go to the bathroom. They'd be crying and sad, and that would make me feel really good. 
IRA He doesn't want to be that guy. He picked up two girls at a bar. Then he had sex with his. And then he came out and had sex with mine. 
MARK In front of you? 
IRA No. 
MARK So being terminally ill makes you a cock-blacker? 
IRA No, what I'm saying is...He's so lost right now that he's hiding from the world. And he's trying to distract himself by doing stand-up and having sex with a lot of women. And he doesn't want anyone to know but me. 
MARK Why you? 
IRA Because he doesn't know me. So he doesn't give a shit. 
LEO That's kind of insulting. 
IRA No, I think we had kind of an instant connection. The other roommate, JAY, walks by. 
JAY You fucked him? 
INT. COMEDY CLUB 
George and Ira are doing sets again. 
INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
George is making a phoney phone call on a speaker phone. Ira listens. 
GEORGE (Grandmother voice) I ordered your Roast Beef. And normally it's delicious. But this time I paid a price! 
DELI MANAGER I'm very sorry ma'am. What if you come in and I give you a free sandwich? 
GEORGE (Grandmother voice) Well that's very nice of you. But I have one question for you. Can I get two sandwiches? George motions for Ira to do something. 
IRA Grandma! Get off the fucking phone. Don't run up my fucking bill. 
Ira starts slapping his hands together. George screams in pain. 
DELI MANAGER Ma'am! Are you okay? 
GEORGE (Grandmother voice) This is a family matter! He can hit me if he wants. He's my grandson, and I love him! Now may I give you my name, so you have it on file so I can get my free sandwich? K-A-C-A-H-A-K-R-E-K-K-U- C-T-A-R-S-U-T-A-R-G-M-S. Did you get that? Can you say it back to me? 
INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 
Ira enters. 
IRA George? George? He walks through the house, finds George in bed. For the first time he seems sick. 
IRA (CONT'D) Are you all right? 
GEORGE No, I had a bad night last night. I was sweating though the sheets, couldn't stop. So I got up, watched half of a season of The Wire and then I slept till...what time is it now? 
IRA It's three in the afternoon. 
GEORGE I wanted to get up and do something. But I don't think I have it in me. I may just go back to bed. 
IRA Well do you need anything? 
GEORGE Yeah, I need all sorts of things. But nothing you can get me. You should go up anyway. You were in a groove the other night, you don't want to get rusty. 
IRA I. .I. .can't anyway. I'm doing the late shift at the deli counter. 
GEORGE Really? How long you gonna keep that job for? I'm paying you good money. What if someone you perform in front of goes into Ralph's and sees you cutting turkey? 
IRA I know, I just want to be safe, make sure I can pay my bills. I don't like to be nervous about that shit. 
GEORGE I wasn't like you. I had a different theory. You've got to spend money to make money. Nothing makes you work harder than being in debt. Maybe we should go buy a Corvette. That'll make you try to be funnier. 
INT. RALPH'S SUPERMARKET 
CHUCK so how much notice are you giving me? 
IRA Notice? I'm not giving you any notice. I'm just quitting. 
CHUCK You're supposed to give notice. That's what people do. 
IRA Why would I give you notice? I'm not trying to stay in Ralph's good graces. I'm not trying to preserve my good standing at Ralph's. 
(MORE) 
IRA (CONT'D) I'm just quitting. You don't quit and then keep working for two weeks. 
CHUCK Well I don't have enough people to cover all your shifts, now I gotta cover them. 
IRA I wish I could help you, but I'll kill myself if I keep working here. It's not what I want to do. Maybe Gail can cover my shifts. 
CHUCK Gail can't work weekends, and my kid's birthday is this weekend. What am I supposed to do? 
IRA I don't know. Get someone to cover from a different Ralph's. There are thousands of them in Southern California. No one else can scoop macaroni into a bowl? I'm not the linchpin that keeps Ralph's from falling into chaos. 
CHUCK You're an asshole. You always thought you were slumming it here. Go tell your tucking fart jokes., Get the fuck out of here before I kick the shit out of you. 
IRA You know what? I'm glad you said that, because I was about to tell you I could work this weekend. What's your problem? I didn't say anything bad about you, I just said I didn't want to work for Ralph's anymore. Chuck takes a step to Ira like he's going to hit him. Ira steps back a few feet. 
IRA (CONT'D) I'll tell Dave. I'll tell Dave. I tried to do this politely. The thanks I get. 
Ira walks out the store. As he walks out, he turns to a lady (in her 40s) at the register. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Please don't do that. 
IRA (tears streaming down his 
FACE) I won't do it, I promise, man. Ira wipes the tears from his face. New tears immediately come out. 
IRA (CONT'D) That was first and last time. I'm not even crying anymore. 
GEORGE 
(CRYING) You're still crying. 
IRA (tears coming down) I don't think I am. I think I'm not anymore. I'm not sure what you're talking about. 
GEORGE Okay, as long as we got that straight. George takes a napkin and puts it over his face. 
IRA I'm sorry, George. I really don't know what to do, I don't know how to help you. 
GEORGE (his face still in the 
NAPKIN) No, you're right. I really should tell some people. It just sucks, man. It just sucks. And they're going to feel so bad, I don't even want to look at them and tell them. 
(MORE) 
GEORGE (CONT'D) I'd rather drop dead. of a heart attack and have someone else make the calls. I have to make those calls? This is a nightmare. This is a total nightmare. 
IRA Do you want me to call them, and tell them what's going on? 
GEORGE Yeah. 
IRA Fuck. I was hoping you were gonna say no. 
INT. IRA'S BEDROOM 
Ira is on the phone. There is a paper with a bunch of numbers in front of him. 
IRA (into the phone) Hi, this is Ira, I'm a friend of George's. He asked me to call you. His roommates are making a commotion outside. Ira covers the receiver. 
IRA (CONT'D) Will you guys shut the fuck up? Shut the fuck up! Ira slam the door. 
IRA (CONT'D) (into phone) I'm sorry. I have some news about George. 
TELLING FRIENDS SEQUENCE 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
George sits with THREE COMEDIANS. They are all laughing and telling old sex stories from george's younger days. Ira sits with them and listens and laughs along. 
GEORGE So I left the phone off the hook so he could hear me doing it. 
COMEDIAN #1 That's very gay. 
COMEDIAN#2 No, it was a buddy thing. It was very heterosexual. 
GEORGE Admit it, you were masturbating. 
COMEDIAN#2 Of course I was whacking it. What else am I gonna do, not whack it? 
GEORGE And I kept making her talk and say crazy shit just to make him laugh. 
COMEDIAN #2 I think at one point you said, "Say my hog is the biggest you've ever seen." And then there is this long pause. 
COMEDIAN#3 That's a bad sign. If it was big at all she wouldn't have paused. 
COMEDIAN #1 Remember you used to have that joke about how you used to only date midgets because your dick looked bigger in their little hands. They all laugh. 
COMEDIAN #2 Yeah, you used to get all the girls, man. Suddenly the air is out of the room, and it is awkward and sad. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
George is talking to an EX-MANAGER and his WIFE. 
EX-MANAGER And I feel horrible about it, but the truth is, I was having some issues with gambling, and you were doing so well-and so I took a million dollar check you got in from the studio and I used it to clear up some debts. And I did it with the intention of paying you right back before you noticed. But you never noticed, and I just never got around to paying you back. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
Allen Covert yells at George for abandoning him. 
IRA Come on, are you kidding me? We all want to be you. Most of my comic friends are just doing a bad impression of you. People love your shit. 
GEORGE Well, I made a lot of people laugh. I guess that's something. 
IRA It's a lot. 
GEORGE Yeah. I guess so. They watch some more and we see a really happy, young George getting big laughs with something really silly. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Look at that crazy motherfucker. 
George and Ira start watching the act and laughing along, like any audience member. 
INT. JAM ROOM - DAY 
George is singing a happy song with a bunch of musician friends, like a Lou Reed/Velvet Underground (or Ramones/New York Dolls/Clash/Warren Zevon/Paul McCartney) song. This music plays over the following montage. 
MONTAGE 
EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY 
George walks around his grounds, slowly. And one gets the sense he's never looked around and seen where he lives before. He likes it. 
INT. IMPROV - NIGHT 
George performs at the Improv. We see him gesture to a woman that she can come up on stage and she hugs him. The crowd erupts. She runs back to her seat. George continues with his act.

GEORGE I never understood why people hiked before. I think I get it now.

INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
George is in bed, sleeping. Ira starts sneaking out. George wakes up, calls Ira back to keep talking to him. 
EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT 
George is walking around his yard at night. He's clearly never walked the grounds at night. He seems at peace. 
INT. GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Lisa and her husband are now over, and George is talking to them and playing with her two-year-old boy. 
EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE 
George is sitting with his parents. It is clear he recently told them about his situation, and although there is sadness in the air, they look happy to be close for the first time in a long time. George says something that makes his DAD laugh. 
INT. GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM 
Ira is asleep on the couch. George walks over with a bowl of ice cream. He whacks Ira a few times trying to wake him up, but Ira keeps snoring. George sits down next to the sleeping Ira and watches TV while eating his ice cream. 
EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY 
George and Ira play basketball. Ira is awful. 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
Ira is making breakfast. George is all dressed for the day. 
IRA What are you doing? 
GEORGE I'm feeling good, so I'm going to the doctor. 
IRA You're not feeling good? 
GEORGE No, I'm feeling good. It's kind of weirding me out. 
(MORE) 
IRA One good thing happens to me in my entire life, and you have to try and take it away and ruin it. 
MOM I don't even know where you came from. 
BOB Don't bother showing up for Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is just for families. 
INT. IRA'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Ira is on his computer. Leo and Mark are watching. 
IRA (typing as he talks) Hey George, we're doing an Orphan's Thanksgiving tomorrow night, want to come? It's just for us losers who don't have any family to eat with. 
LEO He's not gonna email back. 
MARK He's never gonna want to eat Thanksgiving with us. The computer BINGS. The guys scream in delight. 
IRA (reading email) Sure. What time? Do you need me to bring anything? (types back) 3 O'clock at my apartment. Bring wine that we can't afford. The computer bings. 
IRA (CONT'D) (reading email) That's pretty much all wine on earth. See you then. 
MARK 
(EXCITED) Email back and say: (trying to make a joke) If you can, bring that hot chick from your last movie. We definitely have room for her. 
(ALT) Well, then maybe just bring grain alcohol then. They all start laughing. The computer BINGS again. 
IRA (reading it) Hey Faggots, I know what you're doing. Stop emailing me. It's not amusing anymore. They all start high--fiving. 
LEO He called us faggots! 
INT. IRA'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Mark and Leo are doing the cooking. There a few other comedians (male and female) floating around the apartment. Ira watches the parade on TV. Daisy walks up, site down next to Ira. 
DAISY What have you been up to? I haven't seen you at the Improv. 
IRA I've just been busy. Will you excuse me? Ira gets up, walks out of the room. 
EXT./INT. APARTMENT - DAY 
George walks up, rings the bell. Inside the apartment he hears a bit of a scuffle, as if the friends are fighting over who can open the door. Leo opens the door, sweaty, with a welt on his face. 
LEO Hey, George. How are you? Come on in. Then Mark appears from the side, also sweaty, with a welt on his neck. 
MARK Happy Thanksgiving? Come on in. 
INT. IRA'S HOUSE - DINING AREA - LATER 
Everyone is seated around the table. It's very awkward due to George's presence. It seems to suck the air out of the room. 
LEO We're really glad you could come have Thanksgiving with us. It's a big thrill. 
GEORGE It's weird, I feel like the old guy in the room. When I started out I was always the young guy. It's strange how fast you become the old guy. And I feel exactly the same. 
MARK Well, you don't know us, but you're with friends and admirers. 
GEORGE I know you, I've watched your show. "'Nuff Said." It's a good show. 
IRA You don't have to lie to him. He knows it's not good. 
GEORGE No, it's good, it's cute. I like it. 
MARK 
(BASHFUL) I know it's not that funny, but they do slip in some funny shit in there every now and again. 
GEORGE Don't be ashamed, it's good. But what about that girl on the show? How old is she? Tell me she's 25. 
MARK No, she's 15. 
GEORGE Holy shit! I feel bad. I don't want to tell you what I did watching that show. Are you serious? She's 15? 
MARK No, she's actually 20. 
GEORGE Okay, good. Now I don't feel so bad. Their weird friend, FUTORAN, pipes up. 
FUTORAN I heard you were sick and now you're better. Is that like, really... what's that like? 
INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Leo pulls Ira into the other room and goes off on him. 
LEO He asked for me to write jokes too and you didn't tell me! 
IRA Uh...yes. 
LEO You .fucker! 
IRA I didn't think you would want to. 
LEO Why wouldn't I want to? What, I don't like money? I don't like private jets? 
IRA I'm sorry, it's just, I needed the gig. And you are doing so much better than me. I guess I just wanted this for myself. 
LEO It wasn't yours to keep for yourself. You lied to me. 
IRA I did. And it was fucked up. And I am sorry. I don't know what to say. 
LEO Don't say anything. Just get your shit, and get out of the apartment. 
IRA Are you serious? 
LEO You don't get let off the hook for going into faggy apology mode. That is a terrible strategy. 
(MORE) 
LEO (CONT'D) I don't know what the fuck has happened to you--but my name is on the lease, and I don't want to live with it. 
INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER 
Ira is mad at George for bringing up the jokes. 
IRA I never told Leo because I wanted the gig? 
GEORGE I didn't know you were fucking over your friend. Don't yell at me. 
IRA Well I fucking live with you now because he told me to leave. 
GEORGE He kicked you out for that. 
IRA He said friends don't lie and I'm fucking with his career. 
GEORGE Well in a way that's a compliment to me because he's so mad he can't hang out with me that's he mad at you. That's kind of cool. I got you kicked out. 
IRA Fuck off. 
INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Ira is unpacking a dufflebag of clothes he grabbed from his apartment when he was kicked out. George pops his head in. 
GEORGE This should be comfortable in here. This room is almost as big as your old apartment. 
IRA (through gritted teeth) Thank you for letting me stay here. 
GEORGE No problem. Hey, you want to come talk to me while I crash? 
IRA No. You want to come talk to me while I crash? 
CUT TO: 
INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
George is under the covers. He turns on the TV and he changes channels until he finds "Charlie Rose." They're interviewing a reporter from the New York Times about America's policy towards Pakistan. 
GEORGE All right, Charlie. Talk to me. George closes his eyes. 
INT. MANAGEMENT COMPANY - DAY 
George stands in the reception area. 
RECEPTIONIST Terry's ready for you. 
INT. TERRY DOWD'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
GEORGE I was thinking that now might be a good time for me to make that script "Making Amends." 
GEORGE So it's just a list of all the Jewish people? I thought we didn't liked to be tracked and monitored like that. She looks at him, doesn't get the joke. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) You know, because of the... holocaust. 
RACHEL (not understanding) It's just a great way for like- minded people to meet. 
GEORGE What if you don't like Jews? She just stares at him. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) I'm joking. (a beat) So, uh, I hear you raise uh money for an environmental group. That must be very satisfying. 
RACHEL It is, because, fixing the environment is really about having enough of a war chest to sue local government and corporations so they're forced to observe the environmental statutes that are already on the books. We also try to put pressure on the government to put pressure on other countries to clean up their environmental act. You know, one dilapidated factory in China can produce more pollution than every car in America puts out in one year. 
GEORGE See? That's why I still drive a big truck. I stop driving that truck and that factory shuts down. 
RACHEL (not smiling) I know you're joking, but it's a very serious situation. People like you do a lot of damage to the environment. Whether it's taking a private jet by yourself, or getting driven around town limos around town or living in your gas-guzzling houses. Your carbon footprint is huge. 
GEORGE You know what they say about people with a big carbon footprint? Big dick. 
INT. IRA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
George comes in and wakes Ira up. 
GEORGE Come on. We're gonna go do a gig tonight. Up north. And you're gonna open up for me. 
IRA How big a theater? 
GEORGE I think two thousand. 
IRA You should have told me so I could have prepared. I've never played a place that big. How long do you want me to do? 
GEORGE Twenty minutes. Thirty, if you can get there. 
IRA Shit. 
GEORGE Dress nice. Tickets are expensive. 
IRA I don't own anything nice. 
INT. CAR - DAY 
THE Ira is driving George's Mercedes. George sits in player. backseat watching "Cloverfield" on a built-in DVD We see images of different parts of California. 
IRA How fucking up north is this? 
GEORGE Its near San Francisco. 
IRA So we have like five more hours to drive? 
GEORGE It's not that far. It's like two more movies. 
IRA I don't like how you made me your limo driver. It's weird you're in the back and I'm up here. 
GEORGE I'd sit up front but the DVD player is back here. 
IRA I can't even listen to the radio because you're watching the movie. Can I sit back there and you drive? 
GEORGE No. I'm near-sighted. I'll miss the exit. We Lear an EXPLOSION from the movie. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Holy shit! 
IRA What happened? 
GEORGE The monster showed himself. 
IRA 
(SARCASTIC) Great. 
EXT. THEATER - DUSK 
The car pulls up to the theater. 
INT. THEATER - MOMENTS LATER 
One of the MANAGERS walks George and Ira through the back of the theater toward the dressing room. They walk across the stage and we see the empty 2,000 seat theater. Ira is freaked out. 
INT. DRESSING ROOM 
LAURA It was, for awhile. Reveal George in the wings trying to get a look at them from a distance. 
IRA I don't know if you've heard, but it looks like George's medicine is working. 
LAURA What do you mean? 
IPA When George got sick they didn't think they had any medicine that would help, so they put him on experimental medicine. And the last time he went to the doctor they couldn't detect his blood disease. They think it might be gone. A moment as Laura takes this in. 
LAURA Why didn't George tell me? 
IRA He just found out. He doesn't want to jinx it. He doesn't want people to get excited, and then have it come back again. The lights go down. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) Ladies and Gentlemen. Here's the man you came to see. George Simmons. The place EXPLODES. 
IRA 
(JOKING) I thought everyone came to see me. George begins his act. He could not kill harder. Or look more healthy and charismatic. We can tell it is all a show for Laura. Laura is completely thrown by this turn of events. The content of George's act is meant to portray him in a more positive, sympathetic light to Laura. He talks about being sick and the lessons he learned in a very dark, hilarious, and also uplifting way. All of it is intended to make him look like he has grown up and become wiser, and someone you could trust and spend your life with. 
INT. DRESSING ROOM - AFTER THE SHOW 
Laura is talking to George and Ira. 
LAURA I really don't know what to say. It's not like you weren't good before, but your act is so much more sophisticated, but just as funny. I've never seen you speak so honestly on stage before. You used to say these goofy jokes. It was really something, you know, and you should be really proud of yourself. 
GEORGE Thanks. A lot has happened. And at least I got some good jokes out of it. 
LAURA Well, thanks for inviting me. I'm really glad I came. 
GEORGE Ira and I are driving out of town tomorrow, I thought maybe we could stop by your place on our way out. I want to see what the ranch looks like, and meet your husband. 
LAURA My husband is actually in China for another week, or so. He spends a lot of time there helping American businesses break into that market. So you won't meet him this time, but it would be great if you came by. That would be fun. I'll give you the tour. 
GEORGE Okay. We'll come by in the morning. 
LAURA Okay. An awkward beat. Laura gives Ira a hug goodbye, then hugs George goodbye, trying to make it appear as if they have equal weight. 
LAURA (CONT'D) Bye. I'll see you then. She looks at Ira. As she exits-- 
LAURA (CONT'D) You were good too. 
IRA Why do we have to stop by there tomorrow? The drive is long enough as it is. George opens up his wallet, gives Ira a thousand dollars. 
GEORGE Here's your money for tonight. Good job. 
IRA I'm excited to see her ranch. I hear it's delightful. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Ira and George are in a room that has two queen-sized beds. They each lay on their bed in the dark. 
IRA Why couldn't we have gotten two different rooms? 
GEORGE What's the fun in that? You can go pay for your own room, I don't care. 
IRA So, what happened with you and Laura? You seem to get along so well. Why did you cheat on her? 
GEORGE I was young, stupid... and I liked fucking girls. Why do you think I cheated? You would do it too if anyone would fuck you. 
IRA How many times did you cheat on her? 
GEORGE Two or three times ...a week ...for a couple of years. 
IRA Jesus. 
GEORGE It was awful. There was even marriage talk. My parents didn't want me to do it because she wasn't Jewish. She was taking classes to convert, even. I mean, how cool is that? She was changing religions to be with me. She knew more about being a Jew than I did from those classes. She was so cute when she spoke Hebrew, it sounded so wrong. George says the Jewish grand prayer with a waspy accent. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) And then one day, somebody told her, I don't know who. And that was that. 
IRA Why do you want to go see her tomorrow? We could do something productive like get some writing done. 
GEORGE I like her. I love her. I miss her. I just want to spend a little time with her. I know nothing will come of it. I just miss being around her. A beat. George starts clicking through Video On--Demand adult movies. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Anything looking good to you? 
IRA I don't want to watch adult movies with you. 
GEORGE okay. You want to watch Juno? 
George, Ira, Laura, and Mable are sitting on the floor. Ingrid stands on a make-shift stage singing a Miley Cyrus song while wearing a feather boa and sunglasses and a red wig. 
INGRID 
(SINGS) You've got the best of both worlds. Rock it out take it slow. And then you rock out the show! Everyone applauds for her. 
LAURA Okay. Now it's time to see what the judges say. I thought you had a lot of energy, you're clearly gonna make it to the final four, and I love your outfit. What do you think, Randy? 
IRA Yo, dawg. That was the bomb. It was a little pitchy in places, but I dug it. I really dug it. 
MABLE .I'm Simon, and I thought it was horrible. I don't how you made it this far in the competition. 
(MORE) 
MABLE (CONT'D) I think Paula is drunk. You will never be American Idol. 
LAURA Mable, stop it. Stop being mean to your sister. Say something nice. 
MABLE 
(ANNOYED) You were good. 
LAURA Okay, you're not Simon anymore. (to George) Simon, what did you think? 
GEORGE I can't believe I'm saying this, but I agree with Paula. I think you're the one to beat. They all applaud. Ira notices Laura looking at George with admiring eyes that reek of more than friendship. 
LAURA Okay Mable, you're up. Mable instantly starts gyrating in a manner that is not appropriate for a ten-year-old and singing the Fergie song "London Bridge." 
MABLE 
(SINGING) I want to go down like London, London. 
LAURA I told you not to do that. Simon, what do you think? 
INGRID She was horrible! She's a terrible singer! She's inappropriate! 
LAURA Okay, who's next? Randy? 
IRA I don't know, Dawg. It was a bad song choice. I'm not feeling it. 
GEORGE My turn. Get ready to be blown away. 
George gets up on stage. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) 
(SINGING) Take me down to the paradise city. Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty. Oh, won't you please take me home. 
(FASTER) Just an urchin livin' under the street, I'm a hard case that's tough to beat. I'm your charity case so buy me somethin' to eat. I'll pay you at another time! Take it to the end of the line! 
MABLE Boo! 
INGRID Boo! 
GEORGE What? It's Paradise City, by Guns and Roses. 
INGRID You sound like a girl! 
MABLE Vote him off! 
EXT. RANCH - DAY 
Laura sits on a ATV. George sits behind her. Ira is on another ATV with Ingrid sitting in front of him, as he steers. Mable rides a very small dirt bike. 
LAURA All right! Here we go. They start driving down a path that goes around the edge of the ranch. George has his hands around Laura's waist as they drive. Ira looks over, concerned. 
INT. BARN - DAY 
Laura shows them their horses, chickens, goats and ducks. 
EXT. RANCH - DAY 
Laura points out a small pond and a fenced-in riding area. Laura slows down and allows Ira, Mable and Ingrid to get ahead and turn a corner. Then she stops the ATV and turns around and kisses George. George looks surprised, but happy. Laura just stares at him, trying to decide what she makes of him now. Then we hear 
O.S. 
MABLE (O.S.) Mom! Mom! Laura hits the gas and they continue the tour. 
CLARKE This guy's funny. You should be opening up for this guy. Hey, who wants a drink? 
EXT. RANCH - NIGHT 
Everyone is taking a walk around the ranch. It is very pretty outside. 
CLARKE I'm going to retire in seven years. I'm done. I'm playing golf for the next fifty years. Work hard now, then get out. That's my plan. I'm putting in the time. Then I'm getting the fuck out. I don't like working. I will do it. I like what it gets me. But I don't like it. 
GEORGE You ever see Laura act? She was quite an actress in her day. 
LAURA George, stop. 
CLARKE That's what I hear. Can't say I watched that much 'Melrose Place' back in the day. She keeps telling me to watch the videos but, you know, I was never a big 'Party of Five' fan. 
LAURA Well, I also ran a theatre company. And it was down to me and Cameron Diaz for 'The Mask.' I sacrificed a lot for our family. 
CLARKE Okay, if you say so. (a beat) The Mask was a funny fucking movie. You know what other movie Cameron Diaz was great in? 'There's Something About Mary.' Laura looks livid at her husband's insensitivity and disrespect. They keep walking. 
CLARKE (CONT'D) I love walking it off after a big meal. 
GEORGE It's beautiful here at night. 
LAURA There's no pollution here like in LA so you can actually see the stars. 
IRA They are beautiful, but we have to get going. We have a really long drive to get back to Los Angeles. 
CLARKE You can't leave now, you won't get back until daylight. You should crash in the guest house. I'm sure it not as fancy pants as where you live, George, but it's better than driving all night or crashing at a hotel. 
(MORE) 
CLARKE (CONT'D) And if you want to hang out tomorrow I just installed six flatscreens, we can watch all the football games we want. And dog- racing from Florida. There's a big game tomorrow. Ira, you must have played some ball in your day. 
IRA No, I'm just big-boned. 
GEORGE We probably should get some rest before the drive. All right, show us to our quarters, sir. 
INT. GUEST BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 
George sleeps on the bed. Ira sleeps on a couch across the room. The door slowly opens, Laura enters wearing a bathrobe. She walks to the bed and quietly slips under the covers, removing her bathrobe in the process. Without ever speaking, she pulls the covers over both of them and begins to make love to him. George is surprised but not completely shocked and goes along happily with it. ANGLE ON: Ira, he never wakes up. 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
CLARKE You sure you can't stay? 
IRA We really do need to get back. I have to visit my mom. I can't miss it. It's her birthday. Everyone in my family is coming in from across the country for it. She's turning 65. It's very important we get back for it. 
LAURA That's too bad, I wish you could stay. 
CLARKE (very serious) I wish I could say I was gonna see you again, but I can't say that. His eyes start to mist up. 
LAURA Clarke, don't. You don't need to do that. 
CLARKE You know what? I think I do need to do that. One thing I learned in China from some Buddhist friends of mine is it's important to have an open heart, to live in the moment, and to speak the truth to each other. So I'd like to say to you, George, that it was a great pleasure to meet someone who had such a big impact on my wife's life. I really like you. And wish we had more time to get to know each other. And I wish you a peaceful end to your journey. And another great journey on the other side of it. Clarke hugs George. 
GEORGE I really don't know what to say. I re- ally don't know what to say. 
LAURA That was beautiful, honey. Well let me walk them to the car. Ingrid walks over. 
INGRID Don't be sad. Ira told us that his medicine is working and he's not sick anymore. 
MABLE I think that was a secret. I don't think you were supposed to say that. 
CLARKE Mable, take Ingrid into the house. 
MABLE Can we watch another SpongeBob movie? Atlantis.Squarepantis? 
CLARKE Yes. Go into the house and watch a movie now! Mable and Ingrid walk back to the house. 
CLARKE (CONT'D) What the fuck is going on around here? (to Laura) Is that true? 
LAURA I never said that he was still sick. He just took some medicine and it's looking better. You can't detect it in his blood, but it could come back. 
CLARKE Is it looking better? Or is he better? (to Ira) Is he sick anymore? 
IRA Well ...I don't how you define these things-I'm not... sure. 
CLARKE is something going on here? Are you getting your revenge on me while I'm away? I came clean with you, you can't come clean with me. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Not so loud, your kids are sleeping. 
LAURA A tank could roll through this place, it wouldn't wake them up. They kiss some more. She moans louder. 
INT. LAURA'S RANCH - GUEST ROOM 
Ira calls Daisy on the phone, in a panic about what is happening. 
DAISY (V.0.) Hello? 
IRA (on phone) Hey, Daisy. It's Ira. 
DAISY (V.0.) Oh. Ira. What's going on? 
IRA I just wanted to talk to you because I'm in the middle of a terrible situation and I don't have anyone I can talk about it with. My friends are all mad at me and George is kind of losing his mind. 
DAISY (V.0.) You can tell me, what is it? 
IRA Look, I know you think I have the moral code of some guy from the 50s like Dwight Eisenhower, but I'm with George and he's hitting on his ex-girlfriend who's married now and has kids and I don't know what to do. I'm kind of freaking out. I think I'm having a panic attack. 
DAISY (V.0.) Well don't have a panic attack, that's not going to help anything. 
IRA Well telling me to not have a panic attack is not going to stop it. 
DAISY (V.0.) (screaming at the top of her lungs) 
DON'T HAVE A PANIC ATTACK!!! 
IRA Haha, very funny. 
DAISY (V.0.) Seriously, what's going on? 
IRA Well I guess they dated like ten years ago... 
Ira and Daisy begin to have a bonding conversation. 
MUSIC UP - MUSIC THAT MAKES IT FEEL LIKE A NEW DAY, THE 
BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA.

GEORGE 
(EXHAUSTED) Jesus Christ, what time is it already? 
IRA It's 10:15 in the morning. 
GEORGE Oh my god. Really? I mean, this is fun, but I don't know how much I can take. Hopefully they'll take a nap at some point. I want to take a nap. 
IRA They don't look that tired. The kids are yelling and screaming and clearly have eight more hours in them. 
INT. RESTAURTANT - DAY

IRA George! Clarke is coming back to the house. He knows everything! I'm coming to get you. Be at the end of the driveway. No! Be at the next driveway over! To the north! 
EXT./INT. LAURA'S RANCH - NIGHT 
Clarke arrives at the house. He sees George sitting with the kids. 
CLARKE (angry-to Mable and 
INGRID) Can you take it into the family fun room? 
MABLE Are you two going to fight? 
CLARKE Ye s. 
EXT. LAURA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
George and Clarke walk outside. Clarke puts up his fists, ready to fight. 
GEORGE She's not happy. Clarke punches George in the face then kicks him martial arts style. 
CLARKE No one who's married is fucking happy. Leave us alone! You fucked up. You fucked it up with her a long time ago. Let it go or I will kill you. I will literally kill you till you're fucking dead. That disease didn't kill you. But I will kill you. 
GEORGE You shouldn't joke about my disease. That was very serious. Very scary. Clarke punches him several times, but they are more like martial arts hits. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) What the hell is that? Ira arrives. George starts yelling at Ira. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Don't jump in. Whatever you do, don't jump in. I don't want your help! 
IRA Okay. 
GEORGE You said you were getting cigarettes then you ran to the airport to stop her. What kind of friend are you? 
IRA I am a good friend because this entire situation is crazy. You are out of control. 
GEORGE I didn't deserve what you did to me. You betrayed me ! 
IRA When I got there, she was already kissing him. I never even had a chance to stop it. I didn't get to do anything! 
CLARKE Don't pretend you're fucking mad at each other, just to distract me so I won't beat your ass. Clarke pushes George. 
CLARKE (CONT'D) You're gonna come to my house? You're gonna come to my fucking house? You have to get your own life. Leave us the fuck alone. 
GEORGE Don't hit me! I've been sick! They don't know. The medicine is working now, but I'm still sick. Clarke punches George. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) (to Ira) What are you doing? I said to jump in! 
IRA You told me not to jump in. 
GEORGE That's what "don't jump in" means. It means "jump in." Help me! Ira steps in. Clarke hits him hard, then kicks him. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) You're a terrible fighter. 
IRA I know, that's why I became a comedian, because everyone used to beat me up! George runs at Clarke who cracks him in the head hard, sending him to the floor. Then Ira takes a run at him and Clarke kicks Ira in the face twice, with both feet. Laura runs into the middle of the scene. 
GEORGE Laura, tell Clarke to stop! 
LAURA Clarke, please don't do this. 
CLARKE Don't tell me what I can and can not do. 
GEORGE Laura, tell him. Tell him you want to be with me now. Laura doesn't answer. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Laura? 
IRA You made me the tacky? I'm not a lacky, it's a job. 
GEORGE It's not a job, you're a tacky. You're not even that fucking funny. This gets Ira very mad. 
IRA Who cares? If being funny means being like you, I rather be a little less funny. 
GEORGE Mission accomplished. 
IRA You're the only person I know who learned nothing from a near-death experience! You actually went backwards. All it did was it brought out what a prick you are, brought everything bad to the surface. I liked you better when I was sure you were gonna die. 
GEORGE I'm not going anywhere! 
IRA Everything is about you. You don't even know where I live. You've never asked me one question about my life. How much can one person talk about himself ? You never ask me shit about anything! 
GEORGE Who are you to fucking judge anyone? You're not my friend, you just want my money. You just want to get your foot in the door. 
IRA Fuck your money. Fuck you. This has all been a huge mistake. 
GEORGE Wake me when we get home. George climbs in the back seat and tries to go to bed. 
INT./EXT. GEORGE'S CAR - NIGHT

EXT. GUYS' APARTMENT 
Ira pulls up to his apartment. 
IRA okay, I'm getting out. You have to drive yourself home. I'm getting out here. 
GEORGE Why didn't you drive me to my house? 
IRA Because then I'd still have your car. 
GEORGE You'll drop it off later. 
IRA There is no later! I'm not going to ever talk to you again. So I don't want your car. 
GEORGE So that's how it's going to be. 
INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE 
George enters. There is an enormous pile of stuff to do on his dining room table. Several stacks of scripts. One pile has a big post-it note that says: "READ THESE!" 
INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE 
George lies alone in bed, alone. Eyes wide open. It's really bright in his room. George hits a button. The shades automatically close. The room goes dark. Now he's in the dark with his eyes open. He turns on the TV to go to sleep. It's the Today show. It's really happy and morning-themed. The piece on the Today show is very suburban. "How to Clean Up Clutter." 
ANCHORWOMAN (ON TV) You know, when you've got a big family, and you've got a lot of clutter... 
INT. GUYS' APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Ira is talking to Leo. 
LEO We rented out your room to Jay. But you can crash on the couch if you want. 
IRA Oh man, you got jerked off on that couch. 
JONAH I fucking didn't cum on the couch. Just sleep on it for a month, and then we'll find some excuse to boot Jay out. 
IRA Thanks. I'm sorry, I lost my way for a while. 
INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE

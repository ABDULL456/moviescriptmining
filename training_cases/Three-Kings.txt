THREE KINGS 
a screenplay by David O. Russell Story by John Ridley and David O. Russell 
Draft Date: 6/22/98 
FADE IN: 
EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAY 
WIDE ANGLE POV of wide open desert, flat grey sky. 
THE CAMERA is running forward, toward a big sand berm in the distance. There are O.S. sounds: SOLDIER'S EQUIPMENT CLANKING, BOOTS RUNNING ON SAND. Hear a MAN's BREATHING. 
The back of his helmeted head and his uniformed shoulders APPEAR in the BOTTOM of the FRAME, running. This is TROY BARLOW, Sargeant, U.S. Army, 25 years old. On his helmet is a photo-button with a photo of a newborn baby. 
Suddenly, on the sand berm 100 meters ahead, an IRAQI SOLDIER stands. Troy stops in his tracks, out of breath, and stares at the figure on the berm. The Iraqi flutters a white flag over his head, then puts it down and picks up a gun. Troy turns around, we see his face for the first time. 
TROY Are we shooting people, or what? 
SOLDIER #1 (O.S.) Are we shooting? 
TROY That's what I'm asking you. 
SOLDIER #1 (O.S.) What's the answer? 
TROY I don't know the answer. That's what I'm trying to find out. 
PAN TO THREE SOLDIERS 40 yards away -- ZOOM IN -- 
SOLDIER #1 unwraps a stick of gum and puts it into his mouth. TWO OTHER SOLDIERS put out their hands and get pieces of gum. 
PAN TO 100 yards away -- ZOOM IN -- SOLDIER #2 stands with his head tilted back while SOLDIER #3 looks into his eye. 
SOLDIER #3 It looks like a grain of sand, but I don't know how I'm gonna get it out-- 
CAPTAIN VAN METER, 37, crab-like, is in the far distance. 
CAPTAIN VAN METER If they surrender, don't shoot, if they don't surrender, then shoot. 
PAN BACK TO Troy, faces the CAMERA, CLOSE, scared, then turns back to the dune and runs a few yards. 
Stops and stares, raises his rifle.  He aims at the figure on the horizon. 
POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE 
The Iraqi soldier in the cross hairs. Hear Troy's breathing, loud, as he pulls trigger slowly.  Slow motion RIFLE sound. 
Silent pause. The Iraqi soldier stands there, then his neck explodes like a sack of blood. Silent, except for sound of Troy's LOUD BREATHING as he walks toward the big berm, and up to the crest. All we hear are his footsteps and breathing. 
SOLDIER #3 (O.S.) That guy just shot a towel head. 
SOLDIER #4 (O.S.) Bullshit. 
YOUNG IRAQI SOLDIER 
lies on the ground. A piece of his neck is blown away. He is rasping, a flag is clasped in one hand; a rifle in the other. He is looking up at Troy, who looks down at him. 
SMASH CUT TO 
FANTASY - INT. HOSPITAL, TORRANCE, CAL. - DAY 
A WHITE BABY GIRL, covered in blood and placenta, is pulled from between the legs of Troy's WIFE, DARLENE. THE NURSE holds the SCREAMING BABY aloft, proud and happy. 
VIG (V.O.) (deep southern accent) Congratulations, you got yourself a rag head, my man. 
EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAY (PRESENT) 
The rasping Iraqi dies. 
PAN TO CONRAD VIG, 18 or 20, wiry, intense, deep south, wearing Army issue glasses, out of breath. 
VIG Dag. 
Troy turns, upset, murmurs "I Get Around" by the Beach Boys. 
TROY "Gettin' bugged drivin' up and down the same old strip, gotta find a new place where the kids are hip, I get around --" 
SOLDIER #1 I didn't think I'd see anyone get shot over here. 
VIG It looked like the guy's head blew three feet into the air -- 
FANTASY SEQUENCE IN SLOW MOTION 
The Iraqi's head pops three feet into the air. 
BACK TO THE SCENE 
SOLDIER #1 Bullshit, that's not what happened. 
VIG I said it looked like that happened, but then we got here and he was still breathing. 
SOLDIER #2 Oh, my God, it's just like 'Predator,' where the guy, the black guy -- 
SOLDIER #3 Carl Weathers. His arm gets shot off. 
VIG And when it hits the ground, his hand keeps on firing. 
SCENE FROM 'PREDATOR' 
Carl Weathers arm is shot off and keeps firing. 
BACK TO THE SCENE. 
BILL SMITHSON Where the hell are you going? 
Archie is walking off with CATHY DAITCH a young reporter. 
ARCHIE GATES I'll be right back. 
BILL SMITHSON I don't want you helping other reporters, goddamn it. 
SOLDIER #1 We kicked ass. 
SOLDIER #6 We didn't get rid of fucking Saddam -- 
SOLDIER #8 Which totally sucks a big dick. 
SOLDIER #6 Those people are getting reemed -- 
SOLDIER #7 Bullshit, we saved Kuwait, man. 
BILL SMITHSON Who's getting reemed? The Shiites? 
SOLDIER #8 I don't know who they are, man -- 
SOLDIER #6 We got big firepower but we ain't saving them -- 
SOLDIER #5 Fuck that, we liberated Kuwait. 
SOLDIER #1 Weehaaaaaaa. 
Five soldiers chant Lee Greenwood's anthem, "Proud to Be An American" into Smithson's camera -- 
SOLDIERS (CHANT) 'If tomorrow all the things were gone that I worked for all my life and I had to start again with just my children and my wife--' 
WIDE, HIGH ANGLE DOLLYING CRANE OF BIG TENT CITY 
SOLDIERS (CHANT OS) 'I'd thank my lucky stars to -- 
Dissolve to POV from chopper - night - of twinkling lights of vast U.S. Army camp below. 
"Proud to Be An America" blasts. CHOPPER PILOTS sing off key. 
CHOPPER PILOTS '--be livin' here today because the flag still stands for freedom and they can't take that awayyyyy --' 
INT. LARGE ARMY TENT - NIGHT 
"Proud To Be An American" BLASTS on as 
Troy, wearing a checked Arab headdress is paraded on shoulders. He holds up a Coke can in one hand and a Bud can in the other, like torches. 
TROY (screaming the song) And I'm proud I to be an American, where at least I know I'm free. And I won't forget the men who died, who gave that right to me. And I'd gladly stand up; next to you and defend her still today. Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land, God bless the U S A -- 
Soldiers scream and go nuts. 
Beer is sputtered from soldiers' mouths. 
"I Can't Do Nothing For Ya Man" by Public Enemy blasts. 
WALTER WOGOMAN, 19, quiet, tall, Southern operates two parallel boom boxes like a DJ. 
A Soldier rapidly peels down one Bruce Lee poster on top of another, like a flip-book animating Bruce Lee. Vig wearing a bandage across his nose from the fight on the berm does a series of cheerleader-like karate arm movements. 
Soldiers whip brightly painted toy footballs at Troy. He whips the balls back, is tackled over a table, crashes. 
Soldiers -- Vig, Walter, others -- scream viscerally as the music blasts.  Two soldiers fire their fingers like pistols at Troy on the floor screaming like a fierce animal. 
TROY Rahhhhhhhhhhhhhh. 
Vig screams into Troy's face at point blank range. 
VIG Rahhhhhhhhh. 
TROY Rahhhhhhhhhhhhh. 
CAPTAIN VAN METER Goddamn it, where the fuck did this beer come from we gotta take more Iraqis prisoner tomorrow. 
EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAY 
WIDE SHOT -  HUNDREDS OF IRAQIS walking in the desert, hands raised above their heads. 
TRANSLATOR (MEGAPHONE) Hasnala shi aluno quibaan -- 
CAPTAIN VAN METER We will not hurt you. Lay down your weapons, get on the ground -- 
TWO IRAQIS with bad face wounds get medical help. 
FIVE IRAQIS 
on their knees, plead for mercy in Arabic as they disrobe. They grab and kiss Troy Barlow's hand, as he holds his M-16 on the begging Iraqis. 
TROY It's cool, no one's gonna hurt you -- 
Vig whips out his big Thunder 5 pistol and points it in their faces. 
VIG Did you rape and torture anybody in Kuwait, Abdul? 
The Iraqis wail for mercy. Troy pushes Vig's pistol away. 
TROY You're making them all hysterical. 
Vig points the big pistol at an OLDER IRAQI OFFICER who is the only one not taking his clothes off. 
VIG Take your fucking rags off, take this off. No comprende English, motherfucker? 
TROY What is your fucking problem, Conrad? 
VIG I'm trying to git him to obey the spirit of things but he won't take his rags off. 
Archie suddenly reaches out and grabs the corner of General Horn's collar, with its one star. 
GENERAL HORN They made me a general, pal. 
ARCHIE GATES For what? I don't even know what we did over here, but Schwartzkopf gets a book deal, you get a star, Powell gets to be fucking president-- 
GENERAL HORN Are you high? This is a huge win for us. 
ARCHIE GATES Running the press pool's a real big win for me. 
GENERAL PYE You want us to kill more Americans to occupy Iraq? 
ARCHIE GATES I'm just saying it's ironic, that's all. 
GENERAL HORN What the fuck is ironic? 
ARCHIE GATES We got the biggest army in the world here but Iraq still has the d-bag dictator in power, but that's how the world works I guess. 
GENERAL PYE Just take care of Smithson and maybe he'll hook you up to consult on movies. 
GENERAL HORN It's either that or be a security guard when you retire. 
ARCHIE GATES Fuck you, Ron. 
GENERAL HORN I'm a general now, you can't say fuck you to me. 
ARCHIE GATES OK, sir, but there's another thing I'd like to say, if you don't mind. 
GENERAL HORN Go right ahead, Colonel. 
Archie leans wild-eyed into Horn's face and whispers -- 
ARCHIE GATES Fuuuuuck yooouuuu, Ronnnnn. 
INT. CAPTAIN'S TENT - DAY 
SPLASH -- rubbing alcohol is poured over Vig's extended hand by DOC ELGIN, 25, stocky, black, no nonsense. 
TROY You've washed your hands like a thousand times, Conrad. 
VIG Lord knows what vermin live in the butt of a dune koon. 
DOC Why do you let this cracker follow you around? 
TROY He's a good kid. 
DOC He's a wall-eyed cracker. 
TROY He's got no high school, man, he's from a group home in Jackson -- 
DOC I don't give a shit if he's from Johannesburg. I don't want to hear dune koon or sand nigger from him or anybody. 
VIG Captain uses those terms. 
TROY The point is, Conrad, 'towel head' and 'camel jockey' are perfectly good substitutes. 
DOC Exactly. 
VIG I'm sorry, man, it's a little confusing is all. 
DOC What can I do for your headache? 
Doc Elgin opens a case full of pill bottles. 
TROY Got any Vicadan? 
DOC All gone. How about Caffergot? 
TROY Excellent. Let's translate my Iraqi ass map. 
Troy pops the pills, Doc pulls a document from a folder and opens it as he hovers over a table with Troy and Vig. 
TROY Van Meter's at the big pow wow? 
DOC We're cool for at least three hours, but keep Walter on the door. 
Walter stands by the door wearing night vision goggles. 
TROY Would you take those fucking things off? 
WALTER I never got to use night vision. 
TROY They don't work during the day and stand outside the tent. 
Doc unfolds a big aerial-photo map of the Iraqi desert, next to the rumpled ass map. 
DOC These are definitely Saddam's bunkers near Karbala. 
TROY What's inside? 
DOC According to Intelligence -- Picasso, Armani, Rolex, Mercedes, Sony you name it --  Kuwait was Muslim Beverly Hills and Saddam sacked it. 
VIG Man, get an awesome stereo system with like ten BOS speakers  -- 
TROY Silver Lexus convertible. 
DOC Lexus doesn't make a convertible. 
TROY Yes, they do. 
DOC Infiniti has one coming. 
TROY You're wrong. 
DOC You can't get a car home from here anyway. 
ARCHIE GATES It could be nothing but a sandy love letter from one Eye-raqi to another -- 
TROY It's a series of bunkers near Karbala. 
ARCHIE GATES Maybe. 
TROY Not maybe, definitely. Recon photos match the map. 
ARCHIE GATES May I look at the goddamn map? 
Troy lets go. Archie holds the map up to the light. He then pours some of Doc's rubbing alcohol on the map, and holds it to the light again. He puts the map on the table, turns the light off and clicks on an infra-red flashlight he pulls out. A completely different map appears in green markings. 
VIG Dag. 
ARCHIE GATES That's what makes Rangers badass, we get the best flashlights. 
They stare at the new map in the infrared glow, captivated. 
ARCHIE GATES Still looks like a series of three bunkers in three villages. A bit farther to the west. 
DOC Seventy-five klicks north. 
ARCHIE GATES More like 65. 
TROY Much closer to Karbala. 
ARCHIE GATES Leave at dawn, back by lunch, not a big deal. Of course -- 
He turns the overhead light back on. 
ARCHIE GATES -- there could be nothing inside but starving Arabs and stolen watches, but I think it's worth checking out, even if I have to do it with clueless reservists like you. 
They look at him. 
ARCHIE GATES I mean, I could take the map, but you could talk, it starts to become a pain in the ass for me, so we'll do the gold together. 
DOC What gold? 
ARCHIE GATES You don't even know what's inside these bunkers, do you? 
VIG Rolexes. 
ARCHIE GATES Rolexes are swell, but I'm talking about Kuwaiti bullion. 
VIG You mean the little cubes you put in hot water for soup? 
ARCHIE GATES No. Not the little cubes you put in hot water for soup. 
TROY Gold bricks. 
ARCHIE GATES 5 kilos each, $50,000 in today's market. 
VIG For one gold brick? 
ARCHIE GATES I'm sure Mr. Hussein has divided his bricks. into many different hiding places, but just one hiding place should be easy to take, and that would be enough to get us out of our day jobs. Unless the three kings are in love with their day jobs. 
Dolly: Troy, Doc, Vig stare at Archie. 
FANTASY - EXT. LOS ANGELES - DAY 
SILENT - Troy walks in white shirtsleeves, dark tie, pulling a cart with a salesman's black case on it over a curb. 
FANTASY - INT. OFFICE 
SILENT - Troy kneels at a disassembled photocopier, tools and parts all around him, opens a bag of toner, which spills black dust all over his white shirt 
FANTASY - INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT 
SILENT - Doc is a red cap. He lifts suitcases from the trunk of a black Mercedes while a rich white father (mother and two small children behind) tells him to be careful. 
FANTASY - EXT. MISSISSIPPI WOODS 
Vig fires his pistols with fury at a series of stuffed animals on logs -- blowing the stuffed animals to smithereens. 
BACK TO 
VIG I don't really have a day job. 
TROY What about the risk of taking a Humvee and all that -- 
ARCHIE GATES We do this shit all the time. 
VIG What else did you do, sir? 
ARCHIE GATES In Panama we went sailing in Noriega's boats. 
TROY Wow. 
ARCHIE GATES In Vietnam, we got a big gold Buddha, which we unfortunately dropped in a swamp by accident. 
DOC What about Iraqi soldiers? 
ARCHIE GATES Let's see. They had the shit bombed out them for two months, they're deserting all over the place, and they've completely surrendered to us. That's a beaten army in every sense of the word. 
He looks at them. 
ARCHIE GATES You are now under my command, salute -- 
They salute him. He straightens Troy's salute. 
ARCHIE GATES What's the guy's name outside? 
TROY Walter. 
ARCHIE GATES Cappy. 
Troy kicks at something in the sand -- and a decayed human arm springs out, attached to a body with a half-rotted face. 
TROY Shit. 
ARCHIE GATES We dropped a lot of bombs out here and we buried some guys alive -- 
VIG What do you mean? 
ARCHIE GATES Bradleys with big plows cut through the berms and covered the trenches -- 
FANTASY - A HUGE PLOW 
on the front of a Bradley pushes sand right TOWARD THE CAMERA 
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.) They had the option to surrender, but they chose to die for their country. 
DOLLY INTO five terrified Iraqis, eyes open with fear, as the sand rolls over them. 
BACK TO THE SCENE 
ARCHIE GATES Let's rehearse. 
EXT. DESERT - LATER 
They sit in the Humvee and hold their pistols ready. 
ARCHIE GATES We'll say the cow is the primary guard outside the bunker. We pull up fast, and stop short. 
TROY Got it. 
ARCHIE GATES And -- Go. 
The cow stares as the Humvee pulls up to it fast. Troy and Doc jump out, pistols drawn, flank the cow -- 
The cow steps back, and explodes. 
Troy and Doc stand splattered with cow entrails. The cow's head lands with a thud on the hood of the Humvee. 
ARCHIE GATES Who's hurt? 
DOC It's all cow, I think. 
VIG Yeah, it's all cow. 
He picks cow entrails off himself. 
DOC They said this was swept for mines. 
ARCHIE GATES Mines are forever, Doc. They never get all of 'em. 
TROY (low murmur) 'If you could, help me Rhonda, help help me Rhonda --' 
Archie watches Troy. 
ARCHIE GATES Did you guys see any action at all? 
VIG Only night bombing on CNN, except for Troy's supercool shooting that guy in the neck-- 
Archie takes Vig's BIG PISTOL and EMPTIES THE SHELLS and puts them into his pocket. 
ARCHIE GATES Is sepsis cool? 
VIG What's sepsis? 
DOC Infection of the blood. 
ARCHIE GATES As in septic tank, because that's what happens when a bullet hits you. The lead tears in there -- 
FANTASY - INT. STOMACH MUSCLE AND TISSUE 
Slow motion, a bullet pierces flesh, makes a cavity -- 
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.) Makes a cavity of dead tissue that closes down in a convulsive motion typical of all gunshot wounds. The cavity fills up with bile and bacteria and you're fucked. 
Bile fluid fills the cavity. 
BACK TO THE SCENE 
ARCHIE GATES But other than a wound that blinds, paralyzes, or castrates, the worst wound I've ever seen is something called tension pneumo thorax -- 
DOC I heard something about that -- 
VIG Tension pneumo what? 
ARCHIE GATES A bullet, or a blade doesn't kill you, but makes a little hole in the lung, so every time you breathe, a little air leaks into the chest cavity, which starts to fill up like a balloon. And that balloon starts to push your organs to the side, crushing your lung, your liver, your heart. Your own breathing kills you, one breath at a time -- kinda like a job you can't stand or a bad lie you once told. 
DOC That's not fatal, they can stop it. 
ARCHIE GATES If you know how to make another little hole in the chest to let the air out, just like you would with an overinflated tire. 
They look at Archie, scared by this. 
TROY Can we play the Beach Boys when we go in? 
DOC The goddamn Beach Boys. 
TROY I'm not ashamed of liking the Beach Boys. It calms me down. Better than Mozart. 
ARCHIE GATES Bach. 
EXT. DESERT - DAY - HIGH WIDE SHOT 
'I Get Around' by The Beach Boys BLASTS as the Humvee speeds along. A big American flag flaps in the breeze from a pole at the back of the Hummer. 
The Humvee drives fast into the central square of a small village of low, sand-colored stucco buildings and shanties. 
EXT. BUNKER - DAY 
FOUR NEW IRAQI SOLDIERS, armed with rifles, run from the far side of the square and start shooting. 
30 rock-throwing Shiite scatter at the gunfire. TWO MEN fall to the ground as they are shot. 
CHILD Ma-Maa. 
Vig looks terrified as the crowd scatters, leaving him alone as he points his big unloaded pistol. The soldiers point their rifles as they come towards Vig, when suddenly two of them look to the side and shout. 
ARMED IRAQI SOLDIER Ganan azwar! 
PAN TO a shiny METAL TANKER TRUCK three hundred yards out, bearing down fast on the village square. 
The soldiers open fire on the truck. 
INT - THE CAB OF THE TANKER TRUCK 
The Shiite riding shotgun fires back, as the windshield shatters on the truck. The driver is dead. The other Shiite grabs the wheel. 
BACK TO THE SCENE 
Archie bursts out the front door, followed by Troy and Doc. They freeze as -- 
The tanker truck careens sideways toward them, 50 feet away. 
An Iraqi soldier fires a grenade-launcher off his shoulder which explodes the container on the back of the truck -- 
Milk explodes everywhere, gushing around the wheels of the Humvee and the feet of Archie and the others. 
Shiite women with plastic containers and ceramic jugs rush out from alleys and try to scoop up the milk. Other Shiites crowd the Humvee and climb in. 
Iraqi soldiers drag two bodies from the cab of the truck. Troy and Doc point their guns in the crowd. 
ARCHIE GATES Move. Out of the way. 
Archie shoves Shiite peasants out of the Humvee. 
SHIITE WOMAN Hos-pital. 
She holds a SHIRTLESS BOY of 7 with a bandage around his entire chest. Doc pushes her off the Humvee. 
SHIITE MAN America help. 
He grabs Archie. Troy shoves the man off the vehicle. Vig starts the engine. 
ARCHIE GATES Give them MRE's. 
Troy rips open a large duffel and starts handing out Army Meal Rations to the crowd -- Vig leans on the horn. 
The friendly Iraqi jumps into the rear of the Hummer as it starts to pull away. Archie shoves the friendly Iraqi out, and he lands on his ass in the swarm of chasing Shiites. 
Archie and Troy look back at the debacle as they pull away. 
EXT. DESERT MARSH - DAY 
Raging oil fires, 50 feet high -- billowing black smoke. Walter drives the motorcycle through the smoke. Paco the Cameraman sits on back. Bill Smithson sits in the sidecar. 
BILL SMITHSON This is boring, I already did this damn story, goddamn it, where the hell is the gold? 
WALTER How about rare pelican migration out by the marshes? 
BILL SMITHSON What? 
WALTER These brave pelicans are migrating in spite of massive pollution -- 
BILL SMITHSON Fuck that. Stop the bike. 
Walter keeps driving. 
EXT. DESERT - DAY 
Doc gets out of the stopped Humvee, shaken, and walks around. 
DOC I'm all right, I'm cool. 
He lies down and breathes heavily with a hand on his chest. Archie gets out and walks around, agitated, clearly upset. 
ARCHIE GATES What is the art of war, because it is not for killing people, it's a stratagem to give life to many by killing the evil perpetrated by a few -- I am burning up in this goddamn suit -- 
He angrily takes off his gas suit; boxers and sweat-drenched green T-shirt underneath.  Troy and Vig guzzle water. 
ARCHIE GATES Discriminating use of violence as a last resort, and even then, carefully, surgically, that's what I learned, that's what I'm good at. But now they underestimate all this, bomb the same towns for six weeks  and still leave the scumbag dictator to starve and butcher his own people. 
The others, all drenched in sweat, take off their gas suits. 
TROY (agitated) I don't even know what happened back there. Civilians were spitting on their own soldiers; the soldiers were shooting the civilians and ignoring us -- 
DOC They already surrendered to us. Now they're after Shiites. 
VIG What exactly is a Shiite? 
ARCHIE GATES They make up the ethnic majority but they don't have any power. When Bush pulled us out, he told them to start a civil war to bring Saddam down, and now they're getting wasted. 
VIG (totally puzzled) The civil war? How could it be the civil war? 
FANTASY - STOCK FOOTAGE: UNION SOLDIERS FIGHT DIXIE REBELS 
BACK TO THE SCENE 
Vig looks puzzled. 
TROY It's a war inside the same country, Conrad. That's a civil war. 
Archie chucks each of them MARINE UNIFORMS without name tags which everyone puts on, except Troy. 
Troy backs the truck up. 
Vuitton hat cases are loaded into the back of the truck, which is completely full. 
Archie sits behind the wheel of the Humvee. Vig sits next to him. Archie starts the engine. Iraqi 6 taps on the door of the Humvee by way of saying goodbye. Archie nods. 
The Iraqi Major points to the Shiite Woman. 
IRAQI MAJOR Nazaran yafit haisul. 
Archie watches as Iraqis 6 & 7 walk directly to the circle of soldiers around the woman -- it is now clear she has been raped. They pull her from the group, they stand the Woman in an open area and shoot her dead. 
Troy jerks slightly in his seat and turns away. Doc stares. 
Archie bows his head to the steering wheel and leans there for a second as Vig looks wide-eyed at the dead woman. 
The Girl in arm casts screams. She is grabbed by the hair and pulled away by an Iraqi soldier, but the Man In Glasses punches him and takes the girl. The soldier chases them with a knife and jabs at the man, cutting him, but not lethally. 
Archie gets out of the Humvee and slams the door, walks slowly toward the Iraqi soldiers. 
ARCHIE GATES This has to stop. 
The Iraqis look at him. The soldier with the knife continues to slash the Man In Glasses. 
INTERROGATOR You get your ass kick in a war, it feel good to be strong again. 
ARCHIE GATES What did you say? 
IRAQI MAJOR You go now, please. 
He salutes Archie. 
ARCHIE GATES I don't think so. I'm sure you know about the Geneva Convention, right? 
INTERROGATOR Geneva convention? You bomb my house, man. 
IRAQI MAJOR That Shiite man is leader of uprising. He kill my man. 
TROY Archie, let's stick to the plan, sir. The plan is for gold, right? 
DOC We can help them first, then be on our way. 
TROY No, we can't. It's not what we're here for. 
ARCHIE GATES How much? 
IRAQI MAJOR What? 
ARCHIE GATES How much gold do you want to let these people come with us? 
The Iraqi Major smiles. The Interrogator laughs. 
INTERROGATOR Cannot do. 
ARCHIE GATES What do you mean, cannot do? I'm offering you a lot of money. 
The Iraqi Major continues smiling. 
IRAQI MAJOR Cannot let Shiite go -- 
INTERROGATOR Saddam kill us. 
IRAQI MAJOR Saddam kill to me if we let them go, OK? Now you go. 
ARCHIE GATES Cover me. 
TROY Jesus Christ, we can't save everybody. 
ARCHIE GATES Are you listening? I said cover me. 
Troy and Doc stare at Archie, then Troy gets out of the truck, Doc gets out of the Humvee, and they nervously point their pistols. Troy points his gun at Iraqi 6, who has come forward with a rifle; Doc points at Iraqi 7, who has also come forward. To the rear, Iraqi 6 stands with a rifle, near Iraqis 2,3,4 and the Sargeant stand over the eight prone Shiite prisoners laying face down. 
Vig nervously sits for a moment, then jumps to his feet and mans the mounted machine gun in the rear of the Hummer. 
ARCHIE GATES No unnecessary shots, Conrad, is that clear? 
VIG Yes, sir. 
ARCHIE GATES Because we know what bullets do to vital organs, don't we? 
VIG Make infected pockets filled with bile, sir. 
ARCHIE GATES That's right, that's what they do. 
Troy, Doc, Vig watch with trepidation as Archie walks toward the soldier slashing the Man In Glasses, who carries the Girl. 
Archie reaches over and grabs the slasher's wrist, pulling the blade away from the man's body. He holds the soldier's wrist up. The soldier grabs for Archie's throat with his free hand, but Archie grabs this hand and twists it away, putting the Iraqi into a choke hold. The soldier drops the knife in the dirt. 
The bloodied Man In Glasses collapses to the ground, clutching the Little Girl in arm casts. 
Troy, Doc, Vig point their guns. The Iraqi Major is pissed. 
Archie sweeps the soldier's feet out, pins the soldier face down on the ground, and throws the soldier's gun away. Archie helps the Shiite Man In Glasses to his feet, takes the Girl, and walks them over to the Humvee. 
Two Shiite prisoners try to stand up, the Iraqi guards kick them back down. 
IRAQI MAJOR (pissed) U.S.A. is out of Shiite war. 
The Iraqi Major raises his machine gun as he stands next to the Humvee, but Archie grabs the barrel and holds it down. 
ARCHIE GATES No shooting. 
Troy looks scared as he points his pistol at the Iraqi soldiers, who point their rifles back at Troy and Doc. 
CUT BACK TO the Major pauses, then smashes the barrel of his machine gun, with Archie's hand, against the Humvee. 
Suddenly, THE SOUND of an APPROACHING TANK. They turn. 
A tank rolls toward them fast, down a narrow side street, followed by a truck with a rocket launcher. 
TROY Great, a fucking tank. That should send us on our way. 
VIG Grenade launcher, sir. 
Vig struggles to lift the grenade launcher. 
ARCHIE GATES No. Let's get out of here. 
TROY It's about fucking time. 
Troy jumps into the luggage-packed truck, starts the engine. Vig starts the Humvee; Archie jumps in next to Vig. 
PAN TO the eight Shiites, plus the Man In Glasses and the Little Girl, jam into the crowded Humvee. Doc jumps in. 
The tank approaches. The Humvee pulls away. The tank rolls in from the side, but the tank turret WHINES and CLICKS, stuck in place. An Iraqi pops out the top of the tank. 
TANK IRAQI Hazal mafan. 
He gestures to the whining, stuck, turret. Another Iraqi tries pushing the turret. The truck with the small rocket launcher pulls up. 
INT./EXT. HUMVEE 
as it bounces along fast. Archie is in pain while Doc pours disinfectant over Archie's gunshot wound in his lower left arm, and wraps it. Vig looks terrified as he drives. 
INT. TRUCK 
Troy, driving alone, speeds the truck as fast as it will go, bouncing along the road. 
TROY We were home free, you stupid son of a bitch. 
WIDE AERIAL SHOT 
the truck is 60 yards behind the Humvee 
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.) What's the tank doing? 
POV 
through Doc's jiggling binoculars of the tank turning. 
DOC (O.S.) Lining us up -- 
BACK TO THE SCENE

SLOW MOTION: Doc looks straight up with the binoculars. 
SLOW MOTION: a rocket streaks a squiggly white line of smoke across the sky. 
REAR OF HUMVEE, SLOW MOTION: half the Shiites hunch down, bracing for an explosion while the other half crane their necks, looking straight up into the sky. They cower when there is an EXPLOSION above. 
PAN UP TO - REGULAR SPEED: the ROCKET EXPLODES in the sky a hundred yards above the Humvee -- INTO A BROWN CLOUD. 
DOC Gas. 
Troy leans out the window of the moving truck and squints up at the brown gas cloud above as he drives fast. 
Archie and Doc grapple to put on their gas masks. Vig reaches around behind him for his mask as he drives. 
VIG Where's my mask? 
He accidentally veers off the road into the open desert. 
ZOOM IN TO a field of mines sitting right on top of the sand, 20 yards ahead. [Iraqi mines were often placed this way] 
ZOOM IN ON Archie's alarmed face 
DOC You're gonna die. 
Vig punches Doc in the side of the head. Doc punches Vig in the stomach. They fall to the ground, fighting. 
Archie searches for Troy in the brown haze. 
ARCHIE GATES Barlow. 
Two black-robed figures pull Vig off Doc and drag him to the tunnel. Another robed figure pulls Doc to the tunnel. 
Archie walks, looks for Troy, chokes, vomits into the sand. A black robed figure takes him by the arm and pulls him back to the tunnel, where they disappear inside. 
INT. TUNNEL - DAY 
Chaos. People choking and vomiting. GAS LANTERNS SWING. The tunnel is 6 feet tall. Buckets are passed, filled with oiled rags that people use to wipe their faces. Archie takes a dripping rag and wipes his eyes, nose, mouth. 
VIG We have to go back. We can't leave him there. 
Vig's mutilated right eye is bleeding. 
ARCHIE GATES We have to wait until it clears. 
VIG You made the choice and we lost Troy -- 
ARCHIE GATES I had no choice. 
VIG You had a choice. 
ARCHIE GATES I had no fucking choice. 
He screams at Vig, who looks scared. 
ARCHIE GATES I can't walk away from a crime like that and take the gold and live my life like nothing happened, and if you can, then I hope you die right now. 
Vig starts crying. Doc hands a bandage to Archie, who puts it over Vig's wounded eye socket. 
VIG What about Troy? What choice does he have now? 
PAN ACROSS the Man In Glasses wipes his daughter's face. 
EXT. OASIS BUNKER - DAY 
Iraqi soldiers strip Troy's clothes as he stands in front of Oasis Bunker surrounded only by fortress ruins in the desert. The Iraqi Interrogator pulls off his gas mask. 
Two Iraqi tanks are parked to the side. Small numbers of soldiers and civilians mill about. 
IRAQI SOLDIER (SUBTITLES) Can we shoot him? 
IRAQI SOLDIER #2 (SUBTITLES) We're not even supposed to have American prisoners. 
INTERROGATOR (SUBTITLES) He's proof they broke the cease- fire. 
A GUN SHOT RINGS OUT. The Iraqis turn to look. 
INTERROGATOR They're taking the tank. 
PAN TO 7 Shiites with rifles climb the unmanned Iraqi tank. 4 Iraqi soldiers FIRE back at the Shiites.

INT. BUNKER - CRUDE CEMENT BATHROOM - DAY 
Troy is thrown onto the floor of a cluttered cement bathroom with two crude toilets. His clothes are thrown on top of him. 
IRAQI SOLDIER Get dress. 
TROY OK. 
IRAQI SOLDIER Get dress. 
TROY I said OK. 
The door is slammed. Stolen blenders, radios, CDs, stacks of new Levis litter the floor. Troy kicks all the crap angrily and hundreds of cell phones tumble from a box. 
Troy looks at the pile of cell phones, picks one up, tries it for a dial tone, drops it, tries another, until he gets one that gives him a tone and dials. 
OPERATOR (O.S.) Jalam nafad. 
Troy looks stunned. 
TROY (into the cell phone) Um. Do you speak English? 
OPERATOR (O.S.) (British accent) Yes. 
DARLENE What are you talking about? 
The door is kicked open and soldiers enter. 
TROY Gotta go, gooney-bird, I love you-- 
The soldiers punch Troy in the face, drag him from the room. 
DARLENE Troy? 
She waits for a moment, tears in her eyes, and hangs up. 
INT. TV ROOM OF OASIS BUNKER - DAY 
A MORTAR ROCKS THE ROOM; soldiers frantically exit. 
'CNN' is left playing in the empty room with Bill Smithson's report from the previous day. "I Just Want to Celebrate" PLAYS: 
BILL SMITHSON Spirits are high and the music is soaring as these young troops celebrate -- 
EXT. OASIS BUNKER - DAY 
Iraqi soldiers shoulder-launch a rocket at the tank, EXPLODING it. Soldiers shoot into the flaming wreck. 
PULL BACK TO Bill Smithson and PACO, the cameraman. 
BILL SMITHSON I'm being held captive by Iraqi troops in the gritty city of Karbala, where Shiite -- 
PACO You said gritty city again. 
BILL SMITHSON OK, we'll go again. 
PACO What about Private Wogoman, Bill? 
BILL SMITHSON Let's lay a few of these down first. In three, two, and, I'm being held captive in a gritty suburb of Karbala, where Shiite fundamentalists are rising up -- 
PAN TO Walter is stripped naked by Iraqi soldiers. Their CONVERSATION is in ARABIC and SUBTITLED in ENGLISH. 
IRAQI CAPTAIN You better not let that fucking reporter see you doing this. 
IRAQI SARGEANT Hey, that's the CNN guy. 
IRAQI CAPTAIN Wow. He's much shorter in person. 
IRAQI CAPTAIN Get them out of here now. 
LATER 
Walter sits on the bike, naked. Bill Smithson in the sidecar, Paco in the back. Iraqi soldiers pull the tape out. 
BILL SMITHSON At least let me keep the tape. 
WALTER Could I have my helmet, please? 
They hand him his socks. 
WALTER Helmet. On my head. 
They give Walter his helmet, with built-in radio headset. 
EXT. U.S. COMPANY B CAMP - MESS AREA - DAY

CAPTAIN VAN METER Doc's not here? 
GENERAL HORN You don't know where one of your own fucking aides is? 
CAPTAIN VAN METER How about Barlow? 
The White Assistant shakes his head 'NO.'

Archie, Doc, Vig, and dozens of Shiites crouch as they walk through the tunnel, single file. 
Dissolve 
They are still walking in the long tunnel. 
EXT. OPEN DESERT - DAY 
Archie climbs out of a small mound in the desert, squints in the light and looks around. 
A strange minaret stretches skyward from the flat desert, 200 yards away. The minaret is made of yellow stone, it twists 150 feet into the air, like a twisting wedding cake. 
Archie leads the others toward the minaret. No one is around, except for a few black robes. Archie, Doc, and Vig enter the old wooden doorway of the ancient Minaret. 
INT. MINARET HALLWAY - DAY 
A line of TEN CHILDREN with missing limbs and bandages stand and watch Archie, Doc, and Vig enter. They make eye contact. 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, OASIS BUNKER - DAY 
CLOSE UP: the hands of an Iraqi soldier carefully wrap a bare wire around Troy's right ear. 
ARCHIE GATES Yeah, OK, we need some fighters. 
MAN IN GLASSES So that's worth more than eight suitcases. 
ARCHIE GATES Ten. 
MAN IN GLASSES Fifteen. 
Archie looks at him. 
ARCHIE GATES That's four million dollars. 
MAN IN GLASSES I think we need it more than you, John Doe, don't you? 
He extends his hand. They shake. 
ARCHIE GATES Archie Gates. 
IMAM (MAN IN GLASSES) Imam Katar. I'll give you back five suitcases to get us over the Iranian border. 
ARCHIE GATES What? 
IMAM We gotta get to a refugee camp or we're dead. The camps are in Iran. 
DOC We can't go to the Iranian border. 
IMAM Then we don't have a deal. 
VIG Give me a fucking break, man. 
DOC We saved your life. 
IMAM And we saved yours. 
ARCHIE GATES We lost a man for you. 
IMAM What good is it if you leave us to get wasted? The big army of democracy beats the ugly dictator, saves the rich Kuwaitis, but you go to jail if you help us escape the same dictator.  You saw what happened to my wife. Look at my daughter. 
Archie looks around. He sees Imam's daughter, other bandaged children looking at him. A few mothers. 
ARCHIE GATES Who's going? 
IMAM Everyone but the priests. That's 
VIG Fuck it. We'll find this place on our own. 
IMAM It's not on a map. You can look. 
DOC Somebody else will take us. 
Doc pulls gold bars from a case and holds them up 
DOC Who will take us to Oasis bunker? 
Fifty Shiites turn and look at him silently. Doc dumps a whole suitcase of gold bars. Imam translates. 
IMAM Jarat yalam fantam uraz. 
People stare at the gold and say nothing. 
IMAM I don't think so. 
VIG This is a human life we're talking about. 
IMAM (laughs) Tell me about it. 
His daughter looks at him and laughs -- until her laughter becomes scary, hysterical and Imam tries to hold her still and she won't stop as Archie, Doc, Vig watch. 
INT. OASIS BUNKER - DAY 
CLOSE ON -- Head of a golf clubdriver: "Made in USA." Interrogator holds the golf club near the head, paces. 
INTERROGATOR I only join Saddam Hussein army to make good living for family, good car, good house, and now my son is dead. 
TROY I signed up for the extra cash, too. 
INTERROGATOR We got a lot in common, dude. I got training and guns from America. 
TROY Not from America. 
INTERROGATOR Oh, yeah, specialist guys come to Iraq, train us when we fight Iran. 
TROY What did they train you in? 
INTERROGATOR Weapons, sabotage. Interrogation. 
TROY Great. 
The Interrogator lights a Marlboro, exhales. 
PUSH IN TO CLOSE UP on TROY'S FACE as the smoke envelopes him. 
FANTASY -- INT. TROY'S BEDROOM - TORRANCE 
Darlene looks up and beams as Troy walks into the room, they embrace on the bed. 
INTERROGATOR (O.S.) So what we get from this dirty Iraq war you and me, huh? 
FANTASY - TROY 
holds the naked baby against his naked chest. 
TROY (whispers) I don't know. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Shiites cheer and pat Archie, Doc and Vig on the back as they walk to a bunker built into the side of a small hill. TWO IRAQI SOLDIERS come out smiling to embrace a disoriented Archie and Doc. 
INT. IRAQI BUNKER - DAY 
They pass through a cluttered room with six cots, down a hallway, to a larger room where two more YOUNG IRAQI SOLDIERS sit watching CNN. There is a defaced poster of Saddam, two peacocks and three monkeys in the room, and the half-eaten carcass of a zebra. The soldiers rise and half-bow to Archie. 
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER Food? You give food? 
ARCHIE GATES We don't have any food. 
DOC Where'd you get these animals from? 
IMAM (translates) Kishan tramai jahal? 
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER Kuwait Zoo. Nabal hazala fan taq. 
IMAM This is for you, my friend, to eat if you are hungry. 
The Iraqi Soldier offers a live monkey to Archie. 
ARCHIE GATES No, thank you. 
IMAM They're not barbarians, they're starving. 
DOC I'm getting really dizzy, man. 
Vig sticks out a WHITE TONGUE and nods. 
ARCHIE GATES We need water. 
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER Water all gone. No one have water. 
ARCHIE GATES Radio? 
FRIENDLY IRAQI No radio. 
ARCHIE GATES No radio, no water, but yes CNN. 
The other Iraqis nod their heads and laugh nervously. 
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER George Bush get rid Saddam. 
ARCHIE GATES Not exactly. 
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER Congratulation! 
He embraces Archie, who looks at Imam. 
ARCHIE GATES Would you explain to these gentlemen that we need a vehicle of some kind? 
INT. BUNKER GARAGE - DAY 
It is dark. With a click, several bare ceiling lights come on. Archie, Doc, Vig, stare in amazement: It's an underground garage filled with nine luxury cars: A ROLLS ROYCE, a JAGUAR, a MERCEDES, an INFINITI CONVERTIBLE, FOUR CADILLACS, a WHITE STRETCH LIMOUSINE. The friendly Iraqi smiles. 
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER From Kuwait. 
Doc stops at the convertible. 
DOC Could I ask a question? 
The Iraqi deserters look at him. 
DOC Does Lexus make this model? 
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER No. Infiniti convertible only. 
FRIENDLY IRAQI 2 No Lexus convertible. 
DOC Exactly what I said. 
ARCHIE GATES Listen. We use these cars to go fight Saddam soldiers. 
The Friendly Iraqi looks at Doc and laughs. 
DOC What's so funny? 
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER Cannot take. 
DOC What do you mean, cannot take? We kicked Saddam's ass. We definitely take. 
ARCHIE GATES We are the United States military. 
The Iraqi laughs. 
IMAM You're three guys with a bunch of Shiites and no Humvee. 
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER Need money. Have no money. To eat. To live. Kish falan azar yat imal tanat. 
IMAM He says the Americans have many tanks, many airplanes. We have nothing. 
The Iraqis do not look happy. Imam does simultaneous translation as Archie holds forth. 
ARCHIE GATES We will rise up together. 
IMAM Jihala vamat. 
ARCHIE GATES Rise up together. 
Doc and Vig look taken aback as Archie goes messianic. 
ARCHIE GATES Look at us. Working together. Many races, many nations. Tell him, Doc. 
DOC We are united. 
They raise their joined hands together. 
BACK TO THE SCENE 
TROY Who's got the sick country? 
INTERROGATOR Maybe Saddam is very crazy, right? And then you are crazy to bomb all of Iraq. 
TROY Too much bombing is crazy, but not saving Kuwait. 
INTERROGATOR You come here to save Kuwait people? 
TROY Yes. 
INTERROGATOR Really? (to the Second Iraqi) Jahaza fan. 
The Second Iraqi dips a bucket into an oil drum. 
INTERROGATOR Lots of people in trouble around this world, my man. You don't fight no fahking war for them. 
TROY You invaded another country. You can't do that. 
INTERROGATOR Why not, dude? 
TROY It makes the world crazy. You got to keep it stable. 
INTERROGATOR For what? Your pick up truck? 
TROY No, for stability. Stabilize the region. 
The Interrogator pulls a CD from Troy's pocket and jams it into Troy's mouth. 
INTERROGATOR This is your fahking stability, my main man. 
The Interrogator uses the CD as a funnel to force-feed the crude oil into Troy's mouth as he pours it from the bucket. 
EXT. RIM OF DUNE OVERLOOKING OASIS BUNKER 
Archie, Doc, Vig, stand on a sand ridge and look down on the Oasis bunker in the distance. Behind them are the three cars, Imam, and a handful of Shiite gunmen. They get into the cars. 
EXT. DUNES 
An empty ridge. The Infiniti, Rolls, Mercedes shoot over it, arcing down toward the bunker, engines roaring. 
EXT. OASIS BUNKER 
It is quiet. A Slim Jim is unwrapped as an IRAQI GUARD slowly raises it to his mouth, bites it, chews, and looks puzzled at the cars approaching in the distance. 
HIGH WIDE SHOT - looking straight down. 
The cars drive three abreast down the approach road to the bunker. The Infiniti is in the middle, flanked by the Rolls on the left and the Mercedes on the right. 
INT. INFINITI 
Vig looks scared as he drives the Infiniti straight toward the bunker. A Shiite sits up front with him. Fifty yards from the bunker, Vig turns sharply and drives in circles. 
EXT. BUNKER 
TWO IRAQI GUARDS, one chewing a Slim Jim, look bewildered as they stare at the circling Infiniti fifty yards away. 
INT. MERCEDES 
Archie, with Imam in the passenger seat, two Shiites in back, speeds the Mercedes past the guards, around the right side, to the back side of the bunker, skidding across the sand. 
AERIAL VIEW 
The Mercedes and the Rolls diverge around the bunker on either side: Rolls on the left, Mercedes on the right. 
INT. ROLLS ROYCE 
Doc drives the Rolls around the left, to the bunker's rear. 
EXT. BUNKER 
Iraqi soldiers fire a grenade that blows up right behind the Rolls as Doc skids right up to a rear entrance of the bunker, the grill touching the metal door. Doc parks, blockading the rear door shut, and, with three Shiite riflemen, jumps out. 
INT. INFINITI 
A Shiite helps Vig wedge a piece of wood onto the gas pedal. Vig suddenly grabs his hand in PAIN. The Shiite looks at him. 
VIG Splinter. 
SHIITE Come on. 
EXT. INFINITI 
Vig and the Shiite bail out of the moving Infiniti. Wads of plastic explosive are taped to the grill of the car as it speeds towards the bunker, then drifts to the side -- 
VIG Go straight, go straight -- 
He jumps up and down and points, but the Infiniti goes far to the side of the bunker and explodes into some ruins. The two guards point their guns at Vig and the Shiite and they run into the desert as bullets pop around them. 
EXT. RIGHT SIDE OF BUNKER 
Archie skids the Mercedes to a halt on the right side of the bunker, jumps out, slams the door, followed by Imam and the two other Shiites. 
They run toward the bunker, Archie with a wad of plastic explosive and nails in one hand and a cigarette lighter in the other. He HEARS the CHIRP of a car alarm being activated as he runs to the bunker. 
Imam finds a vent hole on the low facade of the bunker, pulls off a grill. Archie lights a fuse sticking out of the plastic explosive, and drops it into the vent. 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 
Troy gags and spits, his front is covered in oil. The Interrogator raises the bucket. 
INTERROGATOR Are you feeling stable enough for more? 
An EXPLOSION elsewhere in the bunker causes the lights to flicker out. 
Vig gropes the sand for his glasses, crawling on his hands and knees with the dead Shiite on his back. 
VIG You gotta be my disguise, Mr. Shiite, cuz they need my help over there -- 
EXT. DESERT - DAY 
The six Iraqis who took oft from the bunker are still running. Their CONVERSATION is in ARABIC and SUBTITLED in ENGLISH. 
TOUGH IRAQI Let's go back and get them. 
IRAQI #2 Fuck a donkey, no way. 
TOUGH IRAQI There's a chopper, we can do it. 
He and another Iraqi stop while the other two keep running. 
TOUGH IRAQI They killed your families, you fucking cowards. 
The Tough Iraqi and his partner, sweating profusely, out of breath, split up and head back toward the bunker. 
INT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY 
Archie's in great pain. He grimaces as he tightens the bandage around his forearm. Troy is shaking uncontrollably. Doc grabs Troy's shoulders firmly. 
ARCHIE GATES We're gonna get out of here alive, just do what I say, do you hear me? 
Troy nods. Archie pulls one of the football bombs wrapped in C-4 from his small pack, and hands it to Doc. 
Archie pretends to throw with nothing in his hand. 
ARCHIE GATES Step, throw, one-two -- I'm gonna give it a five second fuse. That gives you two steps out the door. 
PAN ACROSS Troy and Doc listen intently. 
Archie cuts the fuse on the ball with his knife. 
The three of them stand at the door, ready. Archie holds his pistol ready. Doc holds the football, Troy holds the lighter. 
ARCHIE GATES Wait -- 
EXT. BUNKER 
Imam, lying in a ditch, is concealed on the side of the bunker, and aims an old rifle at the chopper. 
GUNSHOTS ring off the side of the chopper, chipping plastic. The chopper banks toward Vig in response. 
Vig watches the chopper turn toward him. 
VIG God help me. 
INT. BUNKER 
Troy flicks the lighter and with a shaking hand tries to light the fuse. Archie steadies Troy's hand. The fuse is lit. 
ARCHIE GATES Go. 
EXT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY 
Archie FIRES his pistol as he goes out the door with Troy, also FIRING a pistol. Doc follows with the ball, fuse burning. Doc throws the ball hard at the chopper, hovering 40 feet up. 
INT. CHOPPER 
The chopper turns to face the ball just as it hits the plexiglas window and bounces off, not exploding. The pilots look perplexed. The ball hits the ground and EXPLODES. 
EXT. BUNKER 
Archie, Troy, Doc, stunned -- turn back to the bunker. 
INT. BUNKER DOORWAY - DAY 
They run inside and take cover, catch their breath. Troy and Doc look terrified. 
ARCHIE GATES OK.  Shorter fuse this time. 
He pulls out the second ball, cuts another fuse, affixes it. They wait at the door again, watching the chopper. 
EXT. BUNKER 
Imam, from the side of the bunker, FIRES again, the chopper swivels toward him to RETURN FIRE -- 
INT. BUNKER 
Troy lights the second fuse. They bolt out the door, Troy and Archie FIRING pistols, Doc in the middle with the ball. 
EXT. BUNKER 
SLOW TO FREEZE FRAME MID-STRIDE -- with just THE SOUND OF THE CHOPPER: Archie, Doc, Troy, three abreast, mid-stride. 
RESUME REGULAR SPEED -- Doc unleashes the football. 
PAN TO - SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- the ball hits the chopper broadside and THE CHOPPER EXPLODES INTO A BALL OF FIRE. 
SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: The chopper comes crashing to the ground in a heap of metal. The rotary spins off, whips over Archie, Troy, and Doc's heads and smashes into the bunker. 
Silence. 
Troy and Doc look at each other, and punch their fists together. Troy notices that he's wet his pants. 
ARCHIE GATES We're not done. Check every Iraqi here. 
Archie rolls over bodies lying on the ground, pulls out their weapons. Troy and Doc take rifles from wounded Iraqis. 
TROY (agitated) Where's Conrad? 
ARCHIE GATES Don't let your guard down. 
SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- Vig is hit in the collar bone, ONLY THE SOUND OF THE BULLET SMASHING HIS FLESH AND BONE. He is jerked, falls to his knees, but gets up, keeps staggering toward Troy, 125 yards away. 
Troy looks stunned. 
Archie turns sharply to his right and FIRES a rifle. 
An IRAQI SOLDIER, 150 yards to the side, drops to the ground as Archie and Doc continue to hit him with gunfire. 
Troy runs as hard as he can toward Vig. 
ARCHIE GATES Cover him. 
Doc looks around frantically with his pistol pointed. Archie scans the area and directs 3 SHIITE RIFLEMEN to spread out. 
ARCHIE GATES Lock it down. Shoot anything that moves. 
IMAM (translates) Haza janav yasat. 
Troy runs, catches the staggering Vig in his arms and embraces him. Blood runs from Vig's mouth, onto Troy's shoulder, as Vig tries to talk. 
VIG You made it, man -- 
Troy cries as he runs with Vig in his arms. 
TROY Help him. 
Doc takes Vig from Troy's arms and carefully lays him on the ground, cradling his head in his lap. Vig spits blood. 
VIG What happened to the Jesus fire, Doc? 
DOC It's around you right now, man, it works on this side or the other side. 
VIG You never told me that part. I guess I could go to one of them shrines that erase the bad you did -- 
TROY We made the right choice today, Conrad. 
VIG We did good, right? 
TROY We made the right choice. 
The hole in Vig's collar bone is pumping out blood. Troy puts his hands over it. Doc looks sad and scared as he tries to turns Vig's head to help him breathe. 
DOC Dear Lord watch over this man, help him if you can. Our father who art in heaven -- 
50 Shiites -- children and adults -- sit on the ground near the bunker watch from afar. 
Troy stands up looking around helplessly. 
TROY Help. 
DOC -- hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done -- 
A gunshot rings out and -- slightly slow motion -- hits Troy in the lower right chest -- and comes out again three inches over, piercing a thin piece of his side -- with only the sound of tearing tissue. Troy looks stunned as he is spun around by the shot. 
Archie spins around in the desert and looks at Troy. 
ARCHIE GATES Goddamn it. 
He runs hard across the desert toward Troy. 
Troy falls next to Vig and they look at each other. 
Troy's eyes are wide with pain as he breathes with great difficulty -- RASPING. 
INT. TROY'S RIB CAGE 
His breathing creates an air pocket, crushing his organs to the left side. 
TROY'S POV 
looking up at Doc, who is saying something to Troy, but there's NO SOUND EXCEPT TROY'S LABORED BREATHING 
The POV turns to the side -- Vig is no longer breathing. 
FLASHBACK TO THE OPENING SCENE, but with weird, MUFFLED SOUND 
SOLDIER #5 Take my picture. 
VIG Do you still want to sell pictures? 
TROY (distracted monotone) For twenty. 
SOLDIER #5 Twenty bucks? 
VIG War's been over five days, ain't gonna be any more of this, Jim. 
SOLDIER #5 Twenty dollars, man, what's the meaning of life? 
TROY You're lucky you got to see anybody shot in this war. 
SOLDIER #5 Bobby, take my picture. 
He holds the camera out. 
SOLDIER #4 If he shot the guy, it's up to him. 
SOLDIER #5 It's not like he shot a fucking deer. It's the enemy. 
VIG It's Troy's enemy, yours for twenty. 
BACK TO THE SCENE - CLOSE UP 
Troy lies on the ground, trying to breathe, eyes wide. 
TROY'S POV 
WALTER Oh, OK, and the Tar Baby goes to the briar patch if everything's OK, right? 
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.) No, the other way around. 
WALTER Shit, I'm sorry, sir, I don't remember how the code goes -- 
INTERCUT WITH Archie, who looks exasperated. He is sweating with a fever and his arm hurts. 
ARCHIE GATES Six personnel trucks and a Humvee. 
WALTER Wow. That's a tall order for a secret operation, sir. 
ARCHIE GATES Talk to my friend Hash. Each driver will get 100K. 
WALTER Did you say 100K? 
ARCHIE GATES Roger. Brer Rabbit at 239 North. Add one medavac pack to the order, and dump the reporter. 
WALTER Roger. Give me two hours.

CLOSE UP A SNOW GLOBE is shaken and little green dollars swirl inside the little world, settling upon an early desert oasis, old buildings, palm trees, donkeys, Three Kings, peasants carrying the baby Jesus, and a Mobil gas station. 
WIDER TO REVEAL HUNDREDS OF SNOW GLOBES are pulled from the shelves and put into old cloth bags. 
EXT. BUNKER - DAY

Archie looks at the Three Kings in his hand. 
Troy cracks open a snow globe, filters water with a Shiite. 
Dozens of Shiites are doing the same. 
Archie passes an urn to some parched Shiites who drink the water thirstily. Troy, Doc do the same. 
EXT. B COMPANY RADIO TENT - DAY 
Captain Van Meter, General Horn, and two radio decoders stand looking at logs of transmissions. 
CAPTAIN VAN METER There's so many transmissions -- 
GENERAL HORN Narrow it down to what sounds like Archie Gates and a Humvee. 
A Humvee with HAVICHON and Walter drives by behind the oblivious General, leading a convoy of several trucks. 
GENERAL HORN I want a direction, we're not gonna comb the whole goddamn desert -- 
A PRIVATE runs up and hands General Horn a paper. 
PRIVATE This is from Barlow's C.O. at Fort Bragg, something with his wife. 
GENERAL HORN (reads) Fort Bragg? I'll be damned. 
Walter and Hash drive past Smithson and Paco and Cathy.

Imam pours gasoline on a pile of Vuitton suitcases, Troy throws a match, the suitcases go up in a rush of fire. 
EXT. DESERT - LATER 
Imam hands two gold bars to a Shiite peasant, who takes them and moves on. There are two long lines of Shiite peasants patiently waiting to get their gold, as it is handed out by Imam and another Shiite while, Archie, Troy, and Doc watch. Shiites stash their gold bars inside their clothing and bags. 
LATER 
Everyone sits and waits: Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, his daughter, 105 Shiite peasants. 
Troy looks pained, then releases the valve on the tube sticking through his chest bandage and there is a hiss of air. He looks relieved. 
There is the SOUND OF DISTANT MOTORS RUMBLING. An approaching convoy in the desert: six open U.S. personnel trucks, led by a Humvee. 
Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, his daughter, dozens of Shiites watch the convoy approaching -- they hold their guns ready. 
The U.S. Military trucks and the Humvee pull up to the bunker. 
Walter stands in the front of the Humvee with Hash, both wearing sand goggles as they pull up -- Walter salutes. 
HAVICHON Quelle gonzesse, Archie, you got yourself shot. 
ARCHIE GATES Those better be words of sympathy. 
6 ARMY DRIVERS, among them the disillusioned infantrymen interviewed by Bill Smithson earlier, get out of their vehicles, greeted by Doc, Archie, and Imam. 
Walter walks up, carrying a medical pack. 
WALTER Watcha doing out here, Troy? 
They bang fists in greeting. 
TROY Protecting the free peoples of the world, Walter, you know how it is. 
EXT. IRAQI SIDE OF THE BORDER 
Archie helps Troy as they walk three abreast with Doc. 
CHOPPERS ARE HEARD in the distance. They grow LOUDER. Imam turns and looks back. Archie turns around and looks. 
SIX APACHE CHOPPERS approach from the distance 
CLOSE DOLLY Archie. 
ARCHIE GATES Double time. 
He lets go of Troy and starts jogging toward the border. Troy cannot jog, he crouches down, and is passed by the others. The Shiites look up at the choppers as they jog. Doc and Walter look up also. Archie does not. 
Havichon in the Humvee swings the mounted gun up to the choppers as they pass overhead, loud. 
PAN UP TO Six Apaches hover over everyone's heads and land in the 50 yards between Archie and the border, blocking his path, blowing up dust. 
Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, the Shiites turn and wince in the blowing sand. 
10 U.S. MILITARY POLICE jump from the landing choppers, followed by another TEN U.S. TROOPS with rifles. 
Iraqi soldiers watch apprehensively. 
M.P.S grab Archie, Troy, And Doc, and pull them away from the Shiites. 
Troy shouts over the choppers. 
TROY Wait. 
U.S. soldiers push the Shiites toward the border. 
The Shiites, including two who carry Vig's body, run toward the border unaccompanied by American protection. 
ARCHIE GATES Let them get over the border. 
Troy pulls away from MPS, resisting arrest. 
TROY Let them get over, wait -- 
Plastic handcuffs are put onto Troy, behind his back. 
TROY I have to reach this -- 
Archie and Doc, not resisting, are handcuffed in front -- 
ARCHIE GATES Put his cuffs in front. 
He and Doc are pulled away from Troy. 
Iraqi soldiers take the Shiites prisoner, grabbing them, throwing some to the ground. Troy looks over his shoulder at this as Imam's daughter is ripped from his arms and he is thrown to the ground and dragged. 
TROY Look what's happening. 
He collapses to one knee. 
CAPTAIN VAN METER Not our mission, Barlow. 
Troy grimaces on the ground, he can't breathe, but the cuffs prevent him from releasing his valve. Troy struggles. 
TROY Cut my cuffs -- 
Captain Van Meter leans down to Troy. He shouts over the choppers. 
CAPTAIN VAN METER You fucked me and you're fucked now, so shut your goddamn mouth. 
Shiites are lined up in a firing squad. 
DOC He's gonna die. 
Troy lies on the ground suffocating. Archie drags the MP holding him as he goes to General Horn. 
ARCHIE GATES Goddamn it, Ron, give him medical attention, don't let him die -- 
GENERAL HORN We are not involved in the Shiite problem, do you understand me? You are AWOL, you are a fugitive, you are under arrest. 
ARCHIE GATES Cut his cuffs. 
General Horn walks away as MPS stare at Troy on the ground, concerned. 
A US SOLDIER stares -- upset by what's happening, reaches in his pocket, pulls out a hunting knife, pops the blade, crouches down to Troy, exchanges a look with the MP standing by, and cuts Troy's plastic cuffs. Troy reaches with difficulty to the valve on his chest turns it -- and breathes. 
Archie looks at Troy, then up at the border. 
Imam and the Shiites are lined up in a firing squad. Vig's body is dropped in the sand. 
ARCHIE GATES We got the gold. 
GENERAL HORN What? 
ARCHIE GATES We got the Kuwaiti bullion. 
GENERAL HORN Bullshit. 
Archie pulls away from the MPs holding him and runs toward the lead truck -- where MPs grab and wrestle him down. 
ARCHIE GATES Pull that barrel. 
GENERAL HORN Pull it. 
An MP jumps into the truck, pushes the barrel over; 30 gold bars spill to the sand. 
The General looks at the gold. Troy and Doc, held in custody, watch.  The General makes a 'CUT' signal to the choppers -- and the chopper engines cut off and whir down; it grows QUIET. 
THE U.S. Soldiers -- holding Walter and the Drivers in custody -- stand and watch Archie.

TITLE CARD: SOME OF THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED 
OVER BLACK: APRIL 26, 1978, PLAZA HOTEL, NEW YORK 
1   FADE IN: 
2   INT. PLAZA HOTEL WINDOW NYC - DAY 
IRVING ROSENFELD, not a small man, gets dressed and meticulously constructs his combover. Camera WRAPS AROUND, see his hands with rings adjust his dark velvet suit, up to his face, serious, concentrated, intense, he is composing himself before a performance. 
Irving is now dressed, ready, and walks down the hall to another room. 
3   SECOND PLAZA HOTEL ROOM 
Irving composes himself -- looks into cramped surveillance closet, there are FBI Agents -- we only see their hands and arms -- he looks at monitors -- sees a BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE OF ANOTHER ROOM ON MONITOR: MAYOR CARMINE POLITO, swath of salt and pepper hair, cream suit, pinky ring, Rotary Club pin -- ALONG WITH CARL ELWAY, preppie shady businessman. 
He exhales pressure, turns as CAMERA PANS TO: SYDNEY PROSSER (who will also be known for some time as EDITH GREENSLY), stylish crafty smart. They stare at each other intensely -- they have a deep and emotional relationship. A DOOR BANGS OPEN, and in walks RICHIE DIMASO, Bronx-born. He stands there. 
RICHIE DIMASO What are you doing, going behind my back? Telling people I'm screwing up this operation? I got you a suite at the fuckin' Plaza Hotel! 
IRVING ROSENFELD The shittiest suite at the Plaza Hotel. 
RICHIE DIMASO 
What?! 
IRV ROSENFELD The shittiest fuckin' suite. 
RICHIE DIMASO Based on what--? 
IRVING ROSENFELD 
And the food is wrong, and--What is this? You, like, went in my closet or something? 
EDITH GREENSLY No 
IRVING ROSENFELD Are you dressing him like you're dressing me now? 
EDITH GREENSLY (shakes her head) No, what are you thinking? This isn't all about you, you know that. 
RICHIE DIMASO What, did you try to dress me so I would look like him? 
EDITH GREENSLY No, you're not dressed like him, all right? 
RICHIE DIMASO But I do, I look like him. 
EDITH GREENSLY No, he's in like, velvet. Come on. 
IRVING ROSENFELD You asked me to show you how this was done, you wanna fuck it up be my guest. 
EDITH GREENSLY What is your problem? 
RICHIE DIMASO Hey, look, I never laid a hand on her, all right? Is that what this is about? 
EDITH GREENSLY (British accent) Well technically, that's not true. 
RICHIE DIMASO Look, we never had sex ok? I just -- 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) What'd I do? I put my hand like this -- 
Richie reaches out and puts his hand on Irving's face very carefully, not forcefully. 
Irving swipes it away violently the second it touches his face. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Don't you fucking touch me. That bothers me -- 
RICHIE DIMASO Oh it does? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Oh yeah. 
RICHIE DIMASO That bothers you? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Yes. 
RICHIE DIMASO You know, a lot of shit bothers me too, but I was trying to help you. If I wanted to bother you, if I really wanted to fucking bother you, this is what I'd do. 
Richie takes his hand and destroys the combover Irving spent so much time creating. Irving just stands there, hair ruined, staring at Richie. 
IRVING ROSENFELD You shouldn't have done that. 
Irving just stands there staring at Richie, hair all wild and messed up looking very angry. 
RICHIE DIMASO How's that? You bothered now? (no answer) Alright, don't make a thing of it. 
EDITH GREENSLY You shouldn't touch him. He doesn't like that. 
RICHIE DIMASO Oh my god, fix his hair. Don't make a thing of it. 
EDITH GREENSLY It takes some time, ok. 
Edith walks over to Irving who is still standing there in silence with his hair all over the place. She carefully starts helping him put it back together. 
RICHIE DIMASO Big fucking deal. We got to get in the other room, come on. The mayor's in there. 
EDITH GREENSLY Yes I know that. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) Did you ever have to find a way to survive and you knew your choices were bad? 
Irving walks over and hits the elevator button again. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I learned how to survive when I was a kid. 
7                                                         CUT TO:    7 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) (CONT'D) My father had a glass business. 
28   IRV AS KID SMASHES PLATE GLASS WINDOWS OF BRONX STOREFRONTS     28 
Drumming up business for his father. 
EXT. ROSENFELD & SON GLASS REPAIR CO. - DAY 1940'S 
Young Irving and his Father and Mother standing outside the family's glass repair shop in the Bronx as some tough contractors march up to them. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) I would rather be on the taking side than the getting taken side any day of the week, especially after I saw how my father got taken. I mean, seeing that scarred me for life. 
EXT. UNDISCLOSED STREET - DAY 1940'S 
Young Irving runs by a store front as he throws a rock through each window on the store, smashing them all. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) (CONT'D) I took it upon myself to drum up business. I became a different kind of guy than my father. I became a con artist -- from the feet up, for real. 
CUT TO: 
THE BRONX: STOREFRONT WITH SMASHED WINDOW. - DAY - PRESENT 
Irv shakes his head, surveys the damage. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I was gonna survive no matter what. I still had the glass business and a few dry cleaning stores on the side. 
7G   INT. IRV'S DINGY OFFICE - DAY                                   7G 
Irving paces around his office smoking a cigar and talking on the phone. What looks to be stolen art sits on the floor all around him. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) And I did some art dealing on the side. Stolen or forged art. 
EXT./INT. POOL PARTY - LONG ISLAND HOUSE - DAY 
Chicago's "Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?" fades up. Jamming early 70s HOLIDAY party -- LONG ISLAND LADIES IN BIKINIS WITH HUGE HAIR IN FUR COATS SMOKING OUTSIDE THE GLASS ENCLOSED POOL -while inside steamed glass SHINY BIKINI CANDIDATES FOR NOSE JOBS; A FEW OTHERS WHO ARE LARGE, SEVERAL GUYS WHO LOOK MOBBED UP, pale, out of shape, gold chains, in swim trunks, EVEN MORE BURT REYNOLDS TYPE GUYS, slim, hairy, chains. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) So, one January I go to my friends pool party in Long Island. 
Irving sits holding court with some friends by the pool when he turns and sees Sydney for the first time. 
PUSH IN ON: Irving. He looks up, they lock eyes across the party. 
SYD REACHES FOR A SLICE OF FRUIT ON HIGH SET PLATE WHEN IRVING'S HAND GRABS HER ARM -- she turns, taken aback - 
IRVING ROSENFELD Is that Duke Ellington on your bracelet? 
She does have on a Duke Ellington charm bracelet. 
SYDNEY PROSSER As a matter of fact, it is. He died this year, you know. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I know. I doubt anyone else here knows or cares about it. 
SYDNEY PROSSER Well I care. He saved my life many times. 
Irving takes a good look at her, impressed. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (impressed) Mine too. Which one? 
SYDNEY PROSSER Jeep's Blues. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (smiles, warm) Jeep's Blues. Oh yeah. 
Awkward pause. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) You wanna hear it? 
SYDNEY PROSSER Right now? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Yeah. 
SYDNEY PROSSER Sure. 
CUT TO: PORTABLE RECORD PLAYER PLAYS START OF JEEP'S BLUES as Irving and Sydney nod to it - he watches her foot in her high wedge and her tanned leg rocking as she sits on arm of sofa. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Who starts a song like that?! 
SYDNEY PROSSER It's magic. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Magic. 
They listen to the record, Edith checks Irving out. 
SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.) He wasn't necessarily in good shape, and he had this comb-over that was rather -- elaborate. He had this air about him. And he had this confidence that drew me to him. He was who he was and he didn't care. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) Like me, she was a very particular person. Like me, she came from a place where her options were limited -- and she had been someone she didn't want to be in her past. 
CUT TO -- SYDNEY DANCES IN A SMALL TOWN, OLD FASHIONED STRIP BAR. 
SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.) It actually can feel kind of sexy sometimes. There's a boldness in it. But where would that boldness take me? I didn't know. But I was gonna find out. 
8   CUT TO:                                                         8 
SYDNEY WALKS DOWN A BLEAK INDUSTRIAL STREET. 
SYDNEY PROSSER What is this place? Do you sell art here? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Yeah, sometimes. This is my office. 
SYDNEY PROSSER I know it's your office, but, you have these other places. What's this for? Why did you bring me here? 
IRVING ROSENFELD This getting to be my main business, my growing business. I help get loans for guys that can't get loans. I'm their last resort. 
SYDNEY PROSSER You're their last resort? Because interest rates are north of 12% and heading to 18%. 
IRVING ROSENFELD That's right, smarty pants. 
SYDNEY PROSSER Fucking Jimmy Carter. Fucking Nixon really. And the war and the deficit and all of that shit. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I love you, you're so smart. You are. 
SYDNEY PROSSER Thanks kid but how do you get them the money? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Well -- 
SYDNEY PROSSER You don't do you? You don't. 
IRVING ROSENFELD These guys are lousy risks, you know? I can't get them a loan but I get my fee. Five thousand. 
SYDNEY PROSSER Five thousand? You take five thousand and you don't give them anything? 
IRVING ROSENFELD These are bad guys, you know? They got bad divorces, gambling habits, embezzling, all that shit, you know what I mean? 
SYDNEY PROSSER Everybody at the bottom crosses paths eventually in a pool of desperation and you're waiting for them. 
IRVING ROSENFELD How about `we'? 
SYDNEY PROSSER We? 
IRVING ROSENFELD How bout it? 
Sydney turns and begins walking out the door as Irving chases her out. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) Sydney. Sydney I'm sorry that was too much. I went too far. I didn't want to upset you. 
She continues walking out without looking back and leaves. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) Sydney please, I'm sorry! I know it ain't for everybody. 
The door slams in Irving's face 
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) (Irving shouts to the closed door) Ah GOD I love getting to know you! 
INT. IRV'S DINGY OFFICE - DAY 
IRVING PACES AROUND THE OFFICE UPSET AT HIMSELF. SLOWLY SITS DOWN IN THE DESK CHAIR IN DEFEAT, TAKES OFF HIS GLASSES AND SITS BACK. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (TO HIMSELF) What I do that for? I fucked it up. I should never tell a woman the truth. She's so smart. She's different. 
OFF SCREEN THE DOOR OPENS. SHE WALKS RIGHT UP TO IRVING AS HE SITS AT HIS DESK. SHE TOSSES HER COAT TO THE SIDE. 
IRVING STARES UP HER TENSE -- WHAT WILL SHE DO? 
SYDNEY PROSSER You said it was nice knowing me. You said it was nice to meet me. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Yeah. 
SYDNEY EXTENDS HER HAND TO HIM IN A ROYAL FASHION. 
SYDNEY PROSSER (British accent) Would you like to meet Lady Edith Greensly? 
Irving looks stunned as he slowly clasps her extended hand. 
SYDNEY PROSSER (CONT'D) (British accent) I have royal banking connections in London. I'd love to help you with your loan but of course I have to be very selective. 
IRVING ROSENFELD That was fucking fantastic. 
SYDNEY PROSSER Thank you. Did you like it? 
IRVING ROSENFELD I liked it. I didn't think you were coming back. Thank god you came back. 
SYDNEY PROSSER I wasn't going anywhere. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I fucking love you. 
SYDNEY PROSSER You have me. 
CUT TO: 
40   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET                                            40 
ONE OF SYDNEY'S NANNY FRIENDS, REBECCA, walk out of a BUSINESS MAN's (34) house pushing a stroller as the business man comes chasing after them. 
SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.) And so Irving and I began our partnership -- in love and commerce. 
BUSINESSMAN Rebecca, hold on. You're Edith right? 
SYDNEY PROSSER(V.O.) He told me to tell my friends I had (in British accent) London banking connections 
BUSINESSMAN I'm Jim. I'm her employer. Listen - - she told me you can get me a line of credit. I know you have banking connections in London, England. 
SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.) And after that...say "no" a lot until the guy is hooked. 
Edith and Rebecca start walking away as the businessman chases after them. 
BUSINESSMAN Becky tell her! I've never missed a check! 
Irv and Edith dance through the lobby. 
49   THE PIERRE HOTEL CAFE                                           49 
As they dance among mostly older wealthy couples on the small dance floor of the elegant restaurant as a live jazz quartet plays "I've Got Your Number". Camera circles them, putting their foreheads together, very happy. THEY SING TO EACH OTHER quietly as they dance close. 
50   INT. ROOM AT PIERRE HOTEL -- NIGHT                              50 
Irv and Edith make passionate love, we see in pieces -- 
He gets up, she watches him dress and leave -- 
52   INT. IRV'S CADILLAC - NIGHT                                     52 
53   He drives over the Triborough Bridge.                           53 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) As, as far as I could see, people were always conning each other to get what they wanted. We even con ourselves. 
54   INT./EXT. IRV'S CADILLAC - NIGHT                                54 
55   He drives through the suburb of ranch houses and driveways      55 
56   and pulls into his driveway of his split-level ranch. Irv       56 gets out of his Cadillac and walks to the front door of his house -- 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) We talk ourselves into things. We sell ourselves things we maybe don't even need or want by dressing them up. We leave out the risk. We leave out the ugly truth. 
57   INT. IRV'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                        57 
Irv walks into the decorated ranch house, frosted glass with bird designs, glass tables, walls, black and brown lacquer everywhere. He walks into the house and looks at a picture his son did -- a drawing of the Yankees playing baseball -- that is taped to the refrigerator. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) Pay attention to that because we're all conning ourselves in one way or another just to get through life. 
Irv takes Danny's picture from the fridge and tip toes -- with low sounds now of O.S. TV -- Irv goes to A CLOSED DOOR WITH YANKEE STICKERS on it -- 
Irv OPENS A BEDROOM DOOR TO REVEAL HIS 5 YEAR OLD SON, DANNY. 
SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.) He was married, and he had a son. 
58   INT. DANNY'S ROOM - NIGHT                                       58 
DANNY is on the bed, picture books, baseball cards, spread all around him. Irv stands holding the picture. Danny looks over his shoulder. 
SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.) He had adopted her son. 
DANNY DADDY! 
SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.) He was a really good dad and I respected him for that. It was a tough situation for everyone. 
Irv's face lights up. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Danny. This is a fantastic picture. What did you do today? 
DANNY That kid Donovan is being mean to me. 
IRVING ROSENFELD The big kid? I thought Mommy picked you up so he couldn't bother you. 
DANNY She was late, and then after we put out the fire, mommy said stay in my room with my baseball cards. 
Danny reaches across to Irving and takes his glasses off his face and puts them on. 
IRVING ROSENFELD What fire? 
DANNY Did you know they make a lamp that has the sun in it? [Irv looks at him] Mommy got the lamp. She made her special drink and the lamp made a fire. 
Irv looks concerned. 
59   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                                    59 
Irv's wife Rosalyn sits up on the bed in a muumuu, half her face is burned. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD I put out the fire. The fire is out. 
IRVING ROSENFELD For the first time in my life I do the right thing. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Oh shut up -- 
IRVING ROSENFELD I save a young single mother, and her kid. I marry her. I adopt him - 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD You fell in love! Don't forget we fell madly in love! 
IRVING ROSENFELD Yes, I fell in love. My God, I fell in love. Yes. But you know what? I thought you were mysterious like my mother until it turned out that mysterious just meant depressed, hard to reach. I mean, I'm dying here! And you need somebody who's gonna be quiet like you. You're young, you're beautiful. You gotta find somebody else. You gotta go out and get some friends all right? Don't sit inside -- 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD I don't like going out. You know that I get anxiety when I have to meet people. You know how hard that is. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Yeah but you can't just stay in the house with the fucking sun lamp. Alright? And I can't-- I mean, look, I can't trust you with it anyway. That fire and everything. I can't trust to leave you with Danny. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD I put the fire out Irving! There is no fire! Maybe if you were here more, then there wouldn't have been a fire in the first place. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Oh, what, there wouldn't have been a fire if I was here? 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Just stop with the whole fire thing. God it was a mistake. I'm sure a million people do that all the time. Those sun lamps are dangerous. Shouldn't even have them in the house, really. I bet that happens all the time. This was nothing. 
IRVING ROSENFELD We're not happy. Alright? 
Rosalyn just stares there for a moment at Irving saying nothing. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD You know that I could take Danny. You know that most of your work is illegal. And you know that if you tried to divorce me, you know that-- I'm not saying that I would, but I'm saying that I could. And I'm saying that that is why I don't like divorce, Irving. Women do that in divorces. Women get the children, and then the fathers never see them. My mother never got divorced. My grandmother never got divorced. There are NO divorces in my family. I am not getting a divorce. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Come on. What are we doing here? 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD We fight and we fuck and that's what we do. That's our thing. 
MORT/RICHIE REPEATEDLY TRIES TO HAND IT TO IRV, WHO IS BUSY STARING AT SYDNEY STARING AT MORT. MORT HOLDS THE CHECK IN THE AIR UNCOMFORTABLY AWKWARDLY UNTIL -- almost in slow motion --Edith takes the check -- staring at Mort. IRV STARTS TO LEAVE - 
MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) Zurich? You got an office in Zurich? Paris? I can call Paris? 
IRVING ROSENFELD If you could excuse me for one second? 
MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO Yeah, take your time. Do whatever you need to do. Go ahead, take your time. 
HE HEADS TO THE REAR EXIT WHILE SYD MOVES TO ANOTHER -- IRV OPENS THE DOOR - BAM -- A WARRANT IS HELD UP TO HIS FACE BY STOCKY FBI AGENT SCHMIDT IN A SUIT - HE WALKS IRV BACK INTO THE OFFICE -- 
AS Edith OPENS A SIDE DOOR -- BANG - FEDERAL AGENT STOCK WALKS HER BACK INTO THE OFFICE WITH A WARRANT. 
IRVING ROSENFELD You got the wrong office, you're gonna be embarrassed. 
THE AGENTS START PUTTING EDITH IN CUFFS IMMEDIATELY. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) HEY, HEY, HEY! GO EASY ON HER. 
MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO I may not have you, Irving, but I have her on fraud. Impersonating another individual. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Fraud?! Fraud? What is that? Identity fraud? 
AGENTS SCHMIDT AND STOCK IMMEDIATELY START TAKING BOXES OF FILES FROM DRAWERS, IMPOUNDING EVIDENCE. 
MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO You may be from England, Edith, but you're not royal and you have no banking connections and that's a felony. How long is that? That's 3- 5 years I think. 
EDITH GREENSLY (about the handcuffs) Hey! Not so tight! 
IRVING ROSENFELD Oh really? That's interesting. I don't even know your real name. 
Richie pulls out a badge and shoves it in Irving's face. 
RICHIE DIMASO Richie Dimaso, FBI. Nice to meet you. 
Richie looks at Edith with concern and points at Irving. 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) You gotta get away from this guy. 
Agents take boxes of files out of the office- Irv standing alone in center of room- shell-shocked. 
64   INT. FBI HOLDING OFFICES - DAY.                                  64 
SYDNEY IS LED INTO A HOLDING CELL BY AN FBI AGENT. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) He wouldn't let me see her for three days. He even managed to delay a lawyer. 
INT. FBI HOLDING CELL - DAY 
Dim cell, lit only from small high barred window, no lights on. Edith looks like she's coming apart -- circles under her eyes, a shadow of her confident self -- pale, scared, hair flat, stringy, unglamourous, pacing, rocking. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) 65             She couldn't handle it.                               65 
66   INT. FBI HOLDING CELL - NIGHT                                   66 
FLUORESCENT LIGHTS COME ON IN THE CELL -- Edith squints. Cell is unlocked by Richie Dimaso WHO enters with a cup and saucer of tea. He stands near her with the tea. 
RICHIE DIMASO (to the other side of the two-way mirror) Joe, how come the fluorescents are on? Can we kill that, please? (to Syd) Jesus I put this lamp here for you 'cause I thought it'd be better for you. There's a wire here. They're scared because people hang themselves but I know you're too smart for that. Where's the table and chair? There's no bed here? It's like a fucking asylum. Joe, is everybody off today? Jesus Christ it's scary. Maybe I wanted to scare you. I don't know. Maybe it was my idea. Maybe i'm a little off the beaten path you know? I don't know. You look dehydrated. Here, want to try some tea? Oh yeah, your lips are all chapped. (re: tea) It's herbal. My favorite. 
Richie bends down to Edith who is sitting on the floor in the corner and hands her the cup and saucer. She lifts the cup but her hand is shaking almost violently as she raises the cup to her lips. 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) I know you think -- look at me. Hey. Edith. (MORE) 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) I know you think Irv loves you. I know you think you know him -- that he sees the world as a cold, dark place, and he cares about nobody but very few people on his short list: his son, his father, Rosalyn, and you. And you think you're at the top of that list. But what if you're not. What if you're not even on the list at all? He'd be in here right now if he took the check. 
She thinks about this. She trembles. 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) He'd be in here right now if he took the check. But no, you did. God, it's, it's so clear to me. It's so crazy -- it's clear to me, but it's not clear to you. He uses you, Edith, to protect himself. To protect his son and his wife in Long Island. No? Yes. He put a ring on her finger, he adopted her son. They have huge house, they have two cars. What does she do all day? I'll tell you what she does -- she plays with her nails, she watches T.V., and she spends your money, the money that you make. 
Edith stares at Richie, taking this in. 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) I don't like that you're in jail while he's going free. I don't like any of that. I want to help you. All the razzle-dazzle that he does, it's not good. It's not real. It's fake. It's not real. Who you are is who you are, between you and God. You and your soul. That's what matters. That's what counts. That's what I'm about. And that's what I see in you. Tell me you didn't feel it the first time we saw each other. Am I crazy? I don't think so. I'm not supposed to be talking like this, but I don't care, I break the rules. 
Edith looks at Richie in silence as she thinks about what he's saying. 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) Okay, Edith? Edith. I want to help you. I like you. (whispers) I like you. (dead serious) I like you. 
67   INT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY - DAY            67 
Irv stands alone on the other side of the glass staring at Sydney. 
Richard Dimaso walks in. 
RICHIE DIMASO Been in there three days. Hasn't been so good for her. 
Irv continues to stare at Sydney. 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) How does that make you feel her in there? That check was for you, right? But you knew somethin' was off. That's 'cause you're good. You're, like, the best at what you do in the whole country, aren't you? 
Irv looks at him. 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) But you know what? If the country were run by people like you, Irving Rosenfeld we'd be living in Eastern Europe or Guatemala. You ever been in Guatemala? You ever been in jail in Guatemala? You ever try to get a telephone or a permit or anything in Guatemala? That's what this country would be like if we let people, let the liars like you, run this country. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Who made you god and judge? 
RICHIE DIMASO My grandmother lived to be ninety- three years old. Never lied in her life. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Congratulations. 
RICHIE DIMASO Thank you. I'm proud of that, too. Does that make her not a good person? Is that not something to strive for? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Why you breaking my balls? Get to the point. 
CARMINE POLITO The spicy clams. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Yes. They're always good. 
CARMINE POLITO Oh, they're to fucking die for, those clams. I haven't been there in a while. I like that place. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Carmine -- can I call you Carmine? You know, Carmine -- (catches his breath) My fuckin' heart's going from running down the stairs -- I'm not used to running. There's a lotta green grass in that hotel room up there, alright? And all the deals would float through you. You get a serious piece on both ends. You do with that what you will. I live in the real world, I am a family man, I got mouths to feed and everything. But, you know, we just...we gotta grease you directly. No middlemen, no bullshit. It's the Arab way. 
CARMINE POLITO Yeah, look, I understand. It's a great opportunity. It's just I got a little thrown by going to have a meeting with somebody who ended up not being there, so -- 
IRVING ROSENFELD Hey, listen, I was thrown as well. 
CARMINE POLITO I understand. I'll deal with you directly. I don't want any middleman or any of that bullshit. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Done. 
CARMINE POLITO I like you. Eye to eye. We can do business together. 
Irv smiles and nods as they walk back into the hotel together. 
CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D) How long do you know this guy? You work with this guy before? 
IRVING ROSENFELD I gotta work with him. He's the Sheik's man. 
CARMINE POLITO But I still need to meet the Sheik, okay? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Done. 
94   INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                94 
IRVING ROSENFELD I'm going out to dinner with Carmine and the wives in Camden. 
RICHIE DIMASO Who? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Carmine and myself and the wives. 
RICHIE DIMASO What?! Without me?! 
IRVING ROSENFELD He doesn't like you, what do you want from me, I got him to come back and take the money and you got him on tape alright? I can't make him like you. I did my job. 
RICHIE DIMASO Did you tell him you were working with me? That I'm the Sheik's associate?! 
IRVING ROSENFELD I just fucking told you he doesn't like you. I mean, let him have a night out with a human being for fuck's sake, he's going to jail soon. You're done with him. You got him on tape taking a bribe. 
RICHIE DIMASO Carmine has got to deal with me, Irving. 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) We're gonna use Carmine. We're gonna use Carmine to get other people, that's what we're gonna do. 
IRVING ROSENFELD What?! Like who?! 
RICHIE DIMASO Carmine's gonna use the Sheik to pay off people. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Are you fuckin' nuts? What are you say-- 
RICHIE DIMASO We're gonna let Carmine show the Sheik Atlantic City, how he's gonna renovate hotels, and see who shows up. Whoever the Sheik pays off for licenses and casinos, that's who we're gonna go after. We're gonna go after all of 'em! 
IRVING ROSENFELD More politicians? You realize how fuckin' dangerous that is? There's no fucking reasoning with you. (MORE) 
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) Edith and I were so successful for so long because we kept it just small enough. You are takin' us to a very fucking dangerous place, with very serious numbers! 
RICHIE DIMASO If your that successful, how come you wound up in this room with me? Taking orders from me. 
EDITH GREENSLY You're taking your wife out to dinner? Your fucking wife? Did I just hear you correctly? 
IRVING ROSENFELD That's the one thing you heard me say? 
EDITH GREENSLY I just find it rather shocking that's all. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I get to handle two wives with one dinner, alright? I take Rosalyn out, she keeps her mouth shut, she sees that my work is legitimate, I get to keep my kid, and I get to keep (pointing at Richie) that fucking wife happy. Both wives happy.

Sydney sits alone in her apartment, hair in curlers and sparks a joint. 
96   INT. RICHIE DIMASO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                          96 
Richie sits in his bathroom, his hair in tight curlers, as he eats a chicken wing. 
RICHIE'S MOTHER (O.S.) Richard! What are you doing? Don't eat in the bathroom, I told you so many times! And Diane brought Napoleons for dessert. Come out of the bathroom and pray! 
HE OPENS DOOR - REVEALS WHOLESOME LOOKING NICE QUEENS GIRL DRESSED NEATLY AND HOLDING UP A PASTRY BOX-- 
RICHIE DIMASO Oh my god, what did you do? 
CUT TO: 
97   RICHIE'S MOTHER, ITALIAN, HER HAIR PULLED BACK.                97 
RICHIE'S MOTHER Richard, the filter is broken in the fish tank. It's a problem. 
RICHIE DIMASO See, your job is to do the filter, Mom, mine is to do the gravel. When you don't do the filter right all the fish die. See? 
RICHIE'S MOTHER I can't get the top on that filter. 
RICHIE DIMASO I've gone over this a hundred times mom -- 
CUT TO: 
RICHIE, HIS GIRLFRIEND, AND MOTHER ALL SIT AT THE TABLE WITH FOOD INFRONT OF THEM AS THEY START TO PRAY. 
RICHIE'S MOTHER -- and please help Richard to marry Diane so that I may have grandchildren and the Pope may have more followers. And please bless this food that we are about to eat - 
IRVING ROSENFELD Didn't Jesus say that or something? 
CARMINE POLITO He may have. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Also, always take a favor over money. I think Jesus said that as well. 
CARMINE POLITO (laughing) I don't know if he said the second one but he may have said the first one. 
CUT TO -- Rosalyn DRUNKENLY LEANS IN TALKING TO Dolly POLITO 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (shows her nails) I chip them moving furniture, it's my obsession -- Moving, re- decorating, it makes me feel better like exercise. There's this top coat that you can only get from Switzerland and I don't know what I'm going to do because I'm running out of it but I LOVE the smell of it. 
DOLLY POLITO I can get that for you, of course. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD There's something, the topcoat, (sniffs nails) it's like perfumey but there's also something rotten? I know that sounds crazy, but I can't get enough of it. 
Dolly laughs. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D) No, smell it. It's true. Dolly, historically the best perfumes in the world, they're all laced with something nasty and foul. It's true! 
She puts it under Irv's nose as he talks to Carmine, he sniffs, closes his eyes, nods without even looking. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D) Irving loves them. He can't get enough of them. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I can't get enough. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (hand out to Carmine) Carmine, sweet and sour. Rotten and delicious. 
She leans across the table and puts them under Carmine's nose. 
CARMINE POLITO Smells like flowers. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Flowers, but with garbage. 
CARMINE POLITO You know what that is for me? It's coriander for me. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Irving loves it. He can't get enough. That's what hooks you. He always comes back for it. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I can't stop. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (confidentially to Dolly) He's gonna say we have to talk business in five, four, three, two, one -- 
IRVING ROSENFELD (to girls) Dolly, can me and the mayor talk business here? 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (falling off her seat) AHH-HA-HAHAAAAAAAAHHHHH! 
Carmine and Dolly rush to grab Rosalyn; JULIUS, Carmine's steadfast AIDE, BLACK, 40, BIG SIDEBURNS, LOOSENED TIE and white shirtsleeves, BIG SMILE, helps. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D) No, don't do that it makes me look more drunk than I am! I'm not this drunk. Irving please don't make me go, I was just starting to have fun! 
She WOBBLES INTO ARMS OF his WIFE Dolly, she and Carmine help guide Rosalyn out.

Todd Rundgren's "I Saw the Light" plays somewhere. Edith dressed in tight Halston dress, hair flows huge all round her; walks with Richie, who is waiting in a white gray suit with a white disco collar outside the lapel, chains around his neck. 
EDITH GREENSLY Didn't your fiance want to come out tonight? 
RICHIE DIMASO Yeah, no, I don't know. 
EDITH GREENSLY I'm sorry, we don't have to talk about it. I was just teasing you. 
RICHIE DIMASO Do you ever think, how did I end up here? How did my life become this? You ever think that? And you wonder, am I ever gonna get to a better place or is this it? You ever feel like that? 
Edith stares, nods yes. 
EDITH GREENSLY I do. I definitely know that. 
Edith nods puts a hand on his face. 
EDITH GREENSLY (CONT'D) I'm sorry we don't have to go dancing. We can go have coffee or talk or something. 
RICHIE DIMASO No, I need this. Please, I need to go dancing with you. 
Richie reaches down and squeezes her hand. 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) Please. 
103   Edith smiles.                                                 103 
EDITH GREENSLY OK baby, let's go dancing. 
INT. DISCO - NIGHT 
Richie and Edith DANCE AND DANCE AND SWEAT to Donna Summer's "I Feel Love" -- dance -- riding a high. 
Edith EXCUSES HERSELF to go to bathroom -- breaks away through crowd -- leaves Richie on dance floor -- then SUDDENLY BREAKS AWAY -- RUSHES THROUGH THE CROWD -- 
104   GETS TO THE LADIES ROOM JUST AS SYDNEY DOES --   HE PUSHES HER   104 FROM BEHIND INTO A STALL -- SHE PUTS HER HANDS   ON THE TOP OF THE STALL WALL AS RICHIE RUNS HIS HANDS UP HER   LEGS FROM HER ANKLES AND UNDER HER DRESS - SHE LEANS HER ASS   BACK INTO IT ARCHES HER BACK -- 
SUDDENLY RICHIE STOPS, throws himself back against the other stall wall, out of breath. Edith LOOKS OVER HER SHOULDER -- 
RICHIE DIMASO I really fucking like you. 
EDITH GREENSLY I like you too. I want to live, alright. For real. No more fake shit. Alright? 
She get's real close to his face, almost about to kiss. 
EDITH GREENSLY (CONT'D) We're going to wait until we decide to go for love Richie. For real. That's when we fuck. Not till then, ok? 
RICHIE DIMASO OK. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Really? 
CARMINE POLITO It's science, yeah. That's how it heats up the food. It's scientific. 
IRVING ROSENFELD And you specifically bought this science oven for me. 
CARMINE POLITO (Carmine stares meaningfully at Irv) Yes. A new friend. 
Irv is touched. He sees it is a sincere gift from Carmine, because Carmine likes him; not cynical in any way. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Thank you. 
CARMINE POLITO Don't put metal in it. Come on, let's get out of here. 
SMASH TO: 
EXT. FBI BUILDING - DAY 
RICHIE DIMASO (O.S.) I need a jet at Teeterboro. 
109   INT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY - DAY            109 
RICHIE DIMASO I need a jet at Teeterboro for the sheik. 
STODDARD THORSEN You don't need a jet. Let him walk to the curb at JFK. 
RICHIE DIMASO Stoddard, that's not how it works. You got to do it from the feet up. 
STODDARD THORSEN That doesn't mean anything. What's that mean? 
RICHIE DIMASO It means you gotta be committed! It means you gotta be committed to something in your life, for Christ's sake. I want a jet at Teterboro for the Sheik. It can be a small jet. It doesn't even have to take off, cause I know you're so worried about how much money the Bureau's gonna fucking spend. It can take off and land on the tarmac, okay? 
STODDARD THORSEN Alright, you can have a jet for an hour, but it takes off and lands at Teterboro. 
RICHIE DIMASO I got the jet? 
STODDARD THORSEN You got the jet. 
RICHIE DIMASO 110             Thank you.                                            110 
Richie goes to walk out of Stoddard's office but stops at the door. 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) So tell me the rest of the ice fishing story. 
STODDARD THORSEN Where was I? 
RICHIE DIMASO Your father woke you up, it was a blizzard, it was Lake Canoga. Come on! 
STODDARD THORSEN Okay, well, my brother and I were on the ice and my father came out of the house and I could see him coming. He was holding a lantern, and it was in the blizzard and I knew he was gonna be angry. So I went to intercept my father because I knew if he saw what my brother was doing he was going to kill him. 
Richie cuts him off. 
RICHIE DIMASO So you tried to protect your brother, but you couldn't and that's why you feel bad, because you're trying to protect me and you're worried about me. Is that what the story's about? About protection? 
STODDARD THORSEN No, it's not about protection. 
RICHIE DIMASO It's not about protection? 
STODDARD THORSEN No. 
RICHIE DIMASO Alright, fine. 
Richie walks out the door. 
111   INT. ROSALYN'S KITCHEN - DAY                                   111 
Ros talks to herself carrying tin foil covered tray of lasagna. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (to herself) "Don't put metal in the science oven, don't put metal in the science oven, Rosalyn"...always treats me like a fucking child. I'll do whatever I want. 
She puts the tin foil lasagna into microwave. After a few moments it sparks, explodes into flames. DANNY RUNS IN. 
DANNY (runs in) Another fire! 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (grabbing a fire extinguisher) No, Danny, not that one! That one's empty! We gotta use the big one! 
SMASH TO: 
IRVING ROSENFELD I told you not to put metal in the science oven. Why did you do that for? 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Don't make such a big deal. Just get another one. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I don't want another one. I want the one that Carmine gave me. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD "I want the one Carmine gave me!" Carmine, Carmine, why don't you just marry Carmine, get a little gold microwave and put it on a chain around your neck. You want to be more like Carmine? Why don't you build something like he does, instead of all your empty deals that are just like your fucking science oven. You know I read that it takes all of the nutrition out of our food. It's empty, just like your deals. Empty, empty! 
IRVING ROSENFELD That's bullshit. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD It's not bullshit. I read it in an article. Look, by Paul Brodeur. 
SHE HANDS HIM THE MAGAZINE. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Bring something into this house that's gonna take all the nutrition out of our food and then light our house on fire? Thank God for me. 
Ros stares defiantly, clicks her nails on the counter. PRE- LAP JET ROAR, IRVING STARES AT ROS and BURNED OVEN and looks at the magazine article. 
112   EXT. TEETERBORO AIRPORT TARMAC, NEW JERSEY - DAY                112 
JET ROAR LANDING. A small airport. Irv stands alone, staring at Edith and Richie kissing. Richie, in long full length fleece lined suede coat, walks over towards where Carmine stands. 
CUT TO: 
115   EXT. TETERBORO AIRPORT TARMAC - DAY                              115 
ELO's "10538 Overture" kicks on. Irv and Richie exit the plane walking slightly behind the "sheik" and his "bodyguards" - the sheik in the front. 
The Sheik hands the ceremonial knife to Carmine and bows his head -- 
CARMINE POLITO Hello Sheik, my friend. Welcome. On behalf of the great state of New Jersey I want to welcome you to New Jersey. I know that was redundant. I'm sorry. I'm just very nervous. 
116   Carmine takes the knife and looks to the others excitedly.       116 
CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D) (to "shiek") We have a great party planned for you this evening. 
118   INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                             118 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (half dressed) But what are you talking about, I can't go? I just did my hair and makeup and everything! 
IRVING ROSENFELD The Sheik's very particular. It's international cultural protocol. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD International protocol? What the fuck are you talking about? 
PHONE RINGS -- 
IRVING ROSENFELD Do not answer that! 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (answers phone) Hello -- Robert Spencer? I don't know a Robert Spencer. What do you want? 
IRVING ROSENFELD (takes phone) Give it to me. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Who is that? 
IRVING ROSENFELD (into the phone) Look, I told you, for God's sake, I told you not to call here. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD What is that about? 
RICHIE DIMASO (on phone) Two more federal agents tonight, OK? 
Ros leaves the room. 
IRVING ROSENFELD No way. 
RICHIE DIMASO Yes. They're bodyguards for the Sheik. 
IRVING ROSENFELD That's too many people for me to control, no. 
RICHIE DIMASO Look. I'm in charge here, alright? Just do it. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Rosalyn, get off the extension! 
PAN TO: 
REVEAL ROSALYN IN KITCHEN LISTENING ON THE PHONE. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (hangs up) I'm not on it! 
But she was on it. She heard. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Look, don't call here again, alright? Don't call at home. 
RICHIE DIMASO Alright? 
IRVING ROSENFELD OK. 
RICHIE DIMASO Good night. 
He HANGS UP and walks into the kitchen. Rosalyn looks at him. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Federal agents? 
IRVING ROSENFELD It's bodyguards for the visiting dignitary, that's all. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD What is it, an I.R.S. thing?     Like a tax investigation? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Why you gotta say that? I mean, that's why I can't invite you. It's too complicated. Listen, come on. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Are you in trouble? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Look, stop being so nosy. 
Irving opens the fridge which is a mess. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) Look at this shit. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD I'm only nosy cause you never tell me anything. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Can we clean up this fridge? I mean, what are you causing trouble for all the time? 
PHONE RINGS AGAIN. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) DO NOT ANSWER THAT-- 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (picks up phone) HEL-LO- Oh, hi, Carmine. We were just talking about you. (MORE) 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D) Irving's being a mean, boring man saying that he doesn't want me to come tonight. 
CARMINE POLITO (on phone)Tell him he's crazy! 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Well, I agree. Want to tell him yourself? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Gimme the phone, come on. 
CARMINE POLITO It wouldn't be a party without you! 
Rosalyn walking with Irving, continues to stare daggers at Edith, who stays close to Richie. 
Carmine, Julius, Melora, CONTINUE TO LEAD EVERYONE INTO 
123   INT. THE OCEAN ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                               123 
Carmine continues to walk -- 
CARMINE POLITO This is the Ocean Room -- 
He pushes open double upholstered old doors -- 
THEY ENTER THE LARGE CROWDED YET INTIMATE BEMELMANS STYLE BAR 
The bar -- LIKE THE BEMELMANS BAR AT THE CARLYLE HOTEL IN MANHATTAN - IS LARGE YET INTIMATE -- THERE ARE 50 DRESSED UP CITIZENS THERE DRINKING -- AND A CROWDED LONG BAR -- AND ANOTHER SMALLER BAR ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ROOM --- 
Carmine pauses to stare at the MEN AT THE FAR BAR -- FIVE MEN IN SUITS, 40 TO 60, SLIGHTLY MOB-LOOKING. 
AS Irv IS PULLED ASIDE CONFIDENTIALLY BY Carmine -- Richie AND Edith WATCH -- Rosalyn STANDS TO THE SIDE -- Carmine puts his arm around Irv's shoulders -- 
CARMINE POLITO There are some gentlemen over there at the bar. That's a hundred and thirty years sitting there -- that's how much time's between them. They run the biggest casinos in the United States. We have to work with them. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Right. 
CARMINE POLITO The good news is they know how it's done. They get it done. You don't have to worry. Everyone makes their money. 
IRVING ROSENFELD You mean the Mob? 
CARMINE POLITO Yes, but they're businessmen, okay? Now, spend as much or as little time with them as you like, but we do have to deal with them. All we've got to do is go say hello. We just gotta say hi, that's all. 
Edith looks on, calm, as Richie -- WILD EYED WITH COCAINE AND ADRENALINE -- 
IRVING ROSENFELD Carmine, maybe -- I'm not sure that's such a good idea. We gotta confer before we talk to these guys. 
RICHIE DIMASO (interrupting, hopped up) Confer? What is there to confer about? They're casino guys. 
CARMINE POLITO They are businessmen. 
RICHIE DIMASO We came all this way, Irving. We should be here. What's everybody scared of? There's nothing to be scared of. 
Richie stares down Irv, Edith pulls Richie back -- Rosalyn is starting to go down a SPIRAL OF DEPRESSION as she looks increasingly uncomfortable. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (re: the mob guys) Those are the guys you're all scared of? Those guys over there? They don't scare me. 
She glares at Edith and Irv and pivots to walk to the bar. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Rosalyn! 
But she's already on her way over to the MAFIA MEN at the bar who GREET HER WARMLY as Irv, Edith, Richie, and Carmine watch. 
RICHIE DIMASO I love this! 
Rosalyn walks up to PETE MUSANE, CHARISMATIC, 30 and sits down in between all the Mafia guys.. THE OTHER THREE SALT AND PEPPER MAFIA GUYS LAUGH AND TALK WITH Rosalyn - who gulps a glass of PROSECCO and IS REFILLED BY PETE MUSANE. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Hi.   Can I sit here? 
Carmine whispers to Irv as he watches Rosalyn talk to the Mafia guys. 
CARMINE POLITO Irving, this is not a good idea. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD How you guys doing? Everybody over there is really scared of you guys, you know that? 
She knocks back the prosecco. She seems relieved. 
Dolly ushers her kids to the door. 
DOLLY POLITO Kids, I want you to go up and get some pizza and soda, please. 
Irving and Edith watch in horror at Rosalyn. 
EDITH GREENSLY It's a disaster. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD I think they have this room all wrong. 
PETE MUSANE Yeah? What would you do? 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD I would do it in all black and gold and I would do this bar like a big, warm golden mirror. 
DICK HELSING Sounds beautiful. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Thank you. 
Rosalyn's smitten by the mobsters. 
PETE MUSANE But you expect that from her because she's so beautiful -- 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Oh stop. 
DICK HELSING Gorgeous. 
PETE MUSANE I love her hair, so I know I'm gonna love how she'd do the room -- 
He touches the front of her huge Farrah overhang bangs. Richie, Irving, Carmine, and the Sheik walk up to them. 
RICHIE DIMASO How do you do? 
PETE MUSANE (to Richie) I'm sorry is she your wife? 
IRVING ROSENFELD No, she's my wife. She's my wife. 
CARMINE POLITO Look at these fine gentleman. 
IRVING ROSENFELD That's trouble. 
VICTOR TELLEGIO Who is this guy? (to Irving) What are you, a farmer? 
Richie and Tellegio both laugh. 
CARMINE POLITO Mr. Tellegio, I'm sorry, this is Irving. New York businessman. Irving Rosenfeld. 
VICTOR TELLEGIO Irving, Irving. What's the matter, Irving? What's the problem? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Nothing. No problem. 
VICTOR TELLEGIO Don't get your balls in an uproar. Everything's fine, everything's good. It's all good. It's all good. I just hope the other part of this is all good. And real. Because we're real. You know that. You deal with us. We're a real organization. We deal with you, we don't know what we're dealing with. 
Everyone stares increasingly tense at Tellegio in silence. This could go wrong at any minute. Tellegio looks over to Richie and points to the Sheik. 
Irving watches in horror as -- 
VICTOR TALLEGIO Where's he from? 
RICHIE DIMASO (winging it) Abu Dhabi. 
VICTOR TELLEGIO Oh, he's from the Emirates. 
RICHIE DIMASO Yeah. 
VICTOR TELLEGIO (in subtitled Arabic) (Can I count on you? You gotta be honest about this. Do you understand me? Good means good. No bullshit.) 
PUSH IN ON IRV AND CARMINE FEELING THIS IMMENSE PRESSURE. WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE? 
VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D) (to Sheik) (Did you hear what I said? Do you want me to repeat it?) 
Irving looks ill, as does everyone else at the table. 
VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D) (What do you think now? Tell me. Tell me.) 
RICHIE DIMASO Uh, I think, I think what he's -- 
VICTOR TELLEGIO No, let him speak for himself. 
Sheik swallows hard and looks to Richie. It's a very tense moment for everyone at the table. 
Tellegio stares. Everyone hangs on this. Irving and Richie share a look -- what is he doing? 
A DRUNK, AL KOWALSKI, a working man, friend of the Mayor BARRELS INTO INTO THE TABLE, spilling drinks. Tellegio's guys jump in and grab him and start to pull him away. 
CARMINE POLITO No, I know him. 
AL KOWALSKI You guys are way too serious for a party!(to Tellegio) Hey, what are you drinking? You got a drink? 
TELLEGIO GLARES BACK AT THE INTRUSION. 
CARMINE (to Al) We're in a very serious meeting. (to Tellegio) I apologize. 
TELLEGIO DOES NOT LOOK AMUSED. 
AL KALOWSKI I understand, you're in conference. You gotta come with me now. You got a speech to give. Everyone's waiting for you. 
CARMINE POLITO Al, I'll be right behind you, okay? Trust me. 
Paco Hernandez/Sheik stands up and reaches over to Tellegio to shake his hand. Irving panics. THE MENACING DEEP BASS INTRO OF "WHITE RABBIT" FADES UP ON THE SOUNDTRACK. 
SHEIK ABDULLAH (In Arabic) It is great doing business with you. The investment is real. It was a pleasure to meet you. 
Irving exhales in relief that Paco managed to say anything passable in Arabic. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) What are the odds of an Italian guy from Miami knowing Arabic? But it turns out he's got casino investments in the Mideast and he spent two years learning it to keep the upper hand. 
Victor leans over to talk to Carmine. 
VICTOR TELLEGIO Listen to me carefully. If you're real, you put ten million in the bank of our choice in the next two weeks. 
Carmine nods. 
VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D) Carmine, listen to me carefully, if you're real, you put ten million in the bank of our choice in the next two weeks or not only will the Sheik feel insulted, but our friends in Florida will feel deeply disrespected and so will I. 
Irving looks at Victor, who stares back at him. This is bad. 
AT THE BAR -- 
"WHITE RABBIT" CONTINUES. ROSALYN CONTINUES TO FLIRT WITH PETE MUSANE -- 
SYDNEY WATCHES OUT OF CONTROL ROSALYN, STANDS AND WALKS OVER TO HER. 
EDITH GREENSLY Rosalyn, you need to come with me alright? 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD I don't need to come with you. 
EDITH GREENSLY You need to come with me. This needs to stop. Come on. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Oh, you think I should come with you? 
EDITH GREENSLY Yeah, you need to come with me right now. 
Rosalyn takes her wrist out of Sydney's grasp. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Why don't you get your fucking hands off me, you fucking whore! 
PETE MUSANE Hey! 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD You're a whore. (to everyone) This is my husband's whore! 
CARMINE POLITO (on mic) Hello, Camden! Hello, New Jersey! Hello, Atlantic City! [CROWD ROARS] A lot of my friends been out of work [CROWD WHISTLES - BOOS] A lot of good hard working families just wanna WORK AND LIVE. (crowd CHEERS) There's no money nowhere. You gotta be kidding me! -- don't they remember who built this country? [CHEERS] The one thing we can all agree about in the State of New Jersey is that we never, ever give up! Do we? 
Carmine dominates the crowd and you can see the emotion in his face as he says this. He raises his glass to the crowd. 
CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D) Please, raise a glass with me to a new era that begins tonight. From me and my family, we thank you. For all the hard work that you've given us in the community. Look what you've done. This is beautiful! Thank you! 
Crowd ROARS WILDLY. Irv watches, MOVED AND DESTROYED.

Irving walks in with his keys, same clothes from night before, as ocean sounds continue, TAKES A GUN FROM THE SAFE, and he stands looking lost and lonely, he turns on the electric dry cleaning rack, where he and SYDNEY STOOD TOGETHER, IN LOVE. He looks heartsick. HE STEPS INSIDE THE SWIRLING ELECTRIC DRY CLEANING RACK OF PLASTIC WRAPPED CLOTHES, AND STANDS ALONE, WHERE SYD USED TO BE, AND IS HEARTBROKEN. 
EXT. THIRD AVENUE - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
RICHIE STORMS DOWN THE STREET IN SAME NIGHT CLOTHES.

RICHIE DIMASO Can I use your phone? 
135   INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT DAY - AS SHE WATCHES -- HE paces      135 intense, phone in hand, SHIRT SLEEVES, a mess. HE DIALS. 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) (to Sydney) Last night was insane. I got it all figured out. 
STODDARD THORSEN (on phone) Stoddard Thorsen. 
RICHIE DIMASO (into phone) Listen, I need the Sherman Suite at the Plaza Hotel, okay?

RICHIE DIMASO I need a whole floor. I need it for my operation 
INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
STODDARD THORSEN (on phone) Stop calling it your operation, Richard. It's not your operation. And I'm not giving you a whole floor of the Plaza Hotel. 
INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
RICHIE DIMASO I have members of Congress that are gonna come in right now to try to give the Sheik citizenship. They're taking bribes. This is happening right now. That's what's happening right now. 
INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - DAY 
STODDARD THORSEN (on phone) Bribing members of Congress are you out of your fucking mind? 
INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
RICHIE DIMASO Stoddard. Stoddard! Shut up! Listen! Do you know who Victor Tellegio is? Victor. Tellegio. Works for Meyer Lansky. You know who that is? 
STODDARD THORSEN I know who Victor Tellegio is. 
RICHIE DIMASO Resorts International! He wants ten million dollars. I have two weeks! 
STODDARD THORSEN You're not getting ten million dollars. 
RICHIE DIMASO (screaming) Just listen to me! You're not listening to me! I have two weeks! I have two weeks to put this thing together and I need you to get me the Sherman Suite at the Plaza Hotel. And your going to fucking do it! 
STODDARD THORSEN Lower your voice. You don't get to yell at me. 
Richie SLAMS DOWN THE PHONE. Edith (HAIR IN CURLERS) STARES AT HIM. 
RICHIE DIMASO Calm me down baby. You gotta calm me down. 
He handles her hips and neck and waist and ass. 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) Baby let's do this. Let's do this right now. -- 
EDITH GREENSLY No, no. 
RICHIE DIMASO I want to do this. You're fucking skin is glowing baby. Your skin is glowing. 
EDITH GREENSLY I'm not doing this with you. We're not going to do this unless we do it for real, alright? 
RICHIE DIMASO I want to do this now! 
EDITH GREENSLY That's what we agreed on so we're not going to do that alright? Alright? Where are you? You're acting all scary. 
She grabs him by the head to calm him down. 
EDITH GREENSLY (CONT'D) Are you here with me? 
HE TRIES A GENTLER SEDUCTION. 
RICHIE DIMASO (leans down to her eyes) I love you. I love you. Look at me. (slowly) I'm in love with you. It is real now. I just said it so now's the time. 
He handles her, nuzzles her neck, starts to turn her on. 
EDITH GREENSLY (kissing him) You want the truth? You want real? 
RICHIE DIMASO I'm ready for real. 
SOMETHING CLICKS INSIDE HER -- SHE DROPS HER BRITISH ACCENT -- 
SYDNEY PROSSER (DROPS HER BRITISH ACCENT) OK, this is real. Do you hear my voice? This is real. This is real. What you hear is real. 
Richie steps back quickly and grabs Sydney. 
STODDARD THORSEN You're going to do what? 
RICHIE DIMASO To beat -- your ass. 
STODDARD THORSEN You're going to what? 
Richie SLAMS the phone down, storms out the apartment. 
140   INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                   140 
IRVING ROSENFELD You were right. We should have gone away. 
Irving sits in the corner of the room a disheveled mess. Sydney sits on the bed drinking a Fresca. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) I should have gone away with you. 
SYDNEY PROSSER We were supposed to do it from the feet up like you always said. That's how we were meant to do it but you didn't do it like that. You didn't do it like that. You played it safe so there was always a danger you were going to end up with Rosalyn in the dead space, floating on some dead spaceship with the furniture and the curtains. And I was your life line out and you were mine and that was ok. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (Irving stares at her, emotional) I wish I could get you back. 
He walks across the room and sits down on the bed next to Sydney. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) You know I can't do it without you. You know that. Come on. Me, you and Danny. Like we said. 
SYDNEY PROSSER Like I said. You never said that. I said that. We gotta get over on all these guys. That's what we need to be thinking about right now. 
Irving takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes. 
IRVING ROSENFELD That's big. That's crazy. Whatever it is, it's got to be the best we've ever done. 
Sydney nods her head yes, stares intensely at Irving as the camera tilts down to reveal: their hands clasped together. 
141   EXT. OLD FEDERAL BUILDING - DOWNTOWN - DAY                        141 
High ceiling, old office. Close on a tape recorder. 
AS CAMERA PULLS BACK - SEE   STODDARD, BANDAGES ON HIS BRUISED FACE AND A WHITE EYE PATCH   ON HIS INJURED EYE, SITTING OPPOSITE PROSECUTOR, AMADO   - - the tape recorder and microphone sit on the desk   in front of Stoddard as he records a statement for a report. 
STODDARD THORSEN (SLOW MIDWEST MONOTONE) Agent Dimaso called me late at night on the 21st. I believe that he was intoxicated. He threatened me and I told him this was inappropriate. I told him procedures exist for reasons we must respect. This is the third such call I received from Agent Dimaso. He called me again the night of the 5th and he threatened to kill me. Subsequently he demanded that I allow him to use the Sherman Suite at the Plaza hotel for purposes of bribing members of congress. 
Camera pull-back reveals: THE CHASTENED Richie SITS LISTENING, IN A SUIT AND TIE. He's in trouble with their boss, the prosecutor. 
RICHIE DIMASO I am so sorry. 
STODDARD THORSEN I'm not finished. There's a lot more. 
Richie gets up and pulls up a chair next to Stoddard. Stoddard flinches and moves away like he's going to get hit again. 
RICHIE DIMASO I have nothing but the utmost respect for you as my mentor. (he reaches down and turns the tape recorder off) and as my -- 
STODDARD THORSEN (re: the recorder) What are you doing? 
RICHIE DIMASO I just want to talk from my heart. I don't want it on record. I want to get vulnerable. 
STODDARD THORSEN Can I finish? Can I finish my statement? 
RICHIE DIMASO Of course. I respect you. 
STODDARD THORSEN I think you do other things besides respect me. 
SMASH TO:

Stoddard paces while on the phone, holds up a finger to Richie to wait, Richie picks up Stoddard's phone -- rips the cord out and smashes Stoddard across the face with the base. Doesn't stop til Stoddard falls to the ground, knocks over desk chair and bookcase behind. 
BACK TO: 
INT. OLD FEDERAL BUILDING - DOWN TOWN 
They stare at each other. 
RICHIE DIMASO It's just hard for me to control my passion. I'm a very passionate person. (looks to Amado) You're from New York. You understand this. He goes ice fishing in the midwest. 
STODDARD THORSEN That was told to you in confidence. 
RICHIE DIMASO He's an ice fishing guy. Look at him. 
SMASH BACK TO: 
INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - DAY - FLASHBACK 
Where we left off. Stoddard reaches with bloodied hands across -- what is he reaching for? Oh, on a small table, a gun and a clip. 
RICHIE DIMASO What are you doing pulling out your gun? Stop it. That's not you. 
STODDARD THORSEN No, it's me. This is me. It's me. 
RICHIE DIMASO Don't do something that you don't know anything about. Alright? 
Richie grabs his gun and starts to load it. 
STODDARD THORSEN DO NOT LOAD THAT GUN. YOU DROP THAT GUN. 
RICHIE DIMASO I'll show you how it's done. I'm not even going to hit you. 
He points the gun at Stoddard. 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) Watch this fucko. 
CUT TO: 
PETE MUSANE You said IRS. What IRS guy? What are you talking bout? 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD I hear them on the phone. I think that he's got Irv in some sort of bind or something and he's making him do all of this stuff and so Irv and Carmine right now are at the Plaza Hotel throwing away all this money at like Congress or whatever. They're giving money to congress or something. I don't really know but I overheard it on the phone. 
Pete's brow furrows - this is serious. 
PETE MUSANE You know I hate to do this to you but I have to go talk to your husband. My boss is already angry. You stay here I'm going to give you some money for a taxi home. 
He puts cash in her hands. 
PETE MUSANE (CONT'D) You stay here. Get yourself some dessert. Finish the bottle of prosecco. I'm sorry. 
Rosalyn and Pete hold hands as Rosalyn stares into his eyes. Very emotional. 
PETE MUSANE (CONT'D) You alright? 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (open, vulnerable) I don't like change. It's really hard for me. Sometimes I think that I'll die before I change. 
He kisses her. 
PETE MUSANE It's gonna be okay. You're gonna come live with me in Miami. 
Pete gets up and walks. As he does: 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD 164             Don't hurt him too bad. He's still                    164 Danny's father.

Irv and Carmine down sidewalk leaving from The Plaza Hotel -- 
Pete Musane stands next to an open passenger side door, -- Irv and Carmine do not move, they stare at the open door. 
PAUL MCCARTNEY AND WINGS "LIVE AND LET DIE" STARTS OMINOUSLY. 
INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
170   Rosalyn in full muumuu, wearing cleaning gloves and holding a 170 vacuum sings to LIVE AND LET DIE while Danny sits on the couch watching her. Very intense.

Irving and Carmine sit up front with Pete driving and Dick Helsing sits in the back seat looking angry.

Rosalyn continues to sing and gets more intense as the music picks up. 
INT. PETE MUSANE'S CADILLAC - "LIVE AND LET DIE" CONTINUOUS 
Irving looks over to Pete nervously. Unsure of what's going to happen. 
INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - "LIVE AND LET DIE" CONTINUOUS 
Rosalyn whips her head up and down, dancing manically through the house. 
INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Rosalyn sits on the bed with Danny with clothes all over the place while smoking a cigarette. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Life is ridiculous and I would never say anything bad about your father in front of you but your father is a sick son of a bitch. 
DANNY Daddy's a sick son of a bitch? 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Don't repeat that. But yes. 
EXT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Irving's Caddy comes screeching up to the house and parks in the driveway. Irv get's out and races inside. 
INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Rosalyn is still sitting on the bed with Danny. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (O.S.) (shouts) ROSALYN! ROSALYN! 
Rosalyn looks scared. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) This is a real low in our relationship! You know where I was recently? I was in your boyfriend's fucking car! I saw your nail polish. 
SMASH TO: 
INT. PETE MUSANE'S CADILLAC - FLASHBACK 
IRVING LOOKS DOWN AND SEES THE BOTTLE OF ROSALYN'S NAIL FINISH ON THE CAR SEAT -- HE PICKS IT UP, LOOKS AHEAD THROUGH WINDSHIELD SMELLS IT, WORRIED. Carmine glances over his shoulder anxiously at Dick Helsing in the back seat. 
PETE MUSANE What's this I hear about your curly haired friend working for the Government? 
CARMINE POLITO What?! Who said that? 
IRVING ROSENFELD That's bullshit! 
PETE MUSANE Your wife. 
Irving is surprised to hear this. 
IRVING ROSENFELD That's bullshit. 
CARMINE POLITO Rosalyn? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Wired in. 
172   EXT. MADISON AVENUE - FLASHBACK - CONTINUOUS                    172 
They LAUGH, Irving's hair is all messed up. 
Pete patches out. Irving and Carmine are a mess, shirts ripped open, no buttons, they look at each other VERY SHAKEN. 
CARMINE POLITO Is it true? Is it true what he said about your wife? 
IRVING ROSENFELD It's not fucking true. That's not true. 
INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
IRVING ROSENFELD I can save all of us, and we can save money. I can take care of you and Danny. OK? But you gotta close your mouth. 
Rosalyn looks satisfied and points her finger at Irving. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD I knew it. I have always said, Irving, that you are very, very hard to motivate properly. And I knew that Pete was gonna go over there and knock some sense into you. I've been reading this book, Irving. It's by Wayne Dyer, about the power of intention. 
Irving can't believe what he's hearing right now. 
Rosalyn, very satisfied, reaches over the bed and grabs a book. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D) And my intention in sending Pete over to you was so that you could come up with this plan. So, you're welcome. 
Irving incredulous, thinks to himself how to respond. Forces himself to say gently -- 
IRVING ROSENFELD OK. Thank you, Rosalyn. Thank you for the plan. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD You're welcome. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I appreciate that. So, I think that we should be partners on this. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD I'm a good partner. Almost better than Edith. You ever think about that? You ever think about how you might have underestimated me? 
IRVING ROSENFELD So what is our plan? Tell me the plan. What are you gonna do? 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD I'm going to keep my mouth shut and I'm not going to say anything but what do I do if Pete calls me? What am I supposed to say? 
IRVING ROSENFELD You gotta stop talking about your government agencies and your I.R.S. and your tax and your conspiracies and all of that. You're gonna say how you were wrong, you were wrong about that. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD I'll tell Pete that I was wrong but you know that in real life, I was right for saying all that stuff because then that spurred on the actions that made you come up with this plan. So I will tell Pete. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (holding his head) OK. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD (pointing with cigarette between fingers) The power of intention Irving. The power of intention. 
Irv is doing everything he can to hold it together. 
IRVING ROSENFELD OK. You were right. 
Rosalyn gets up from the bed and walks over to Irving. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) You're so smart. Good job, peaches. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Irving, I've been doing a lot of thinking and -- you need to grow up. And you need to face the facts. And I think that both of us will be a lot happier if we get a divorce. 
As he listens to words he has been saying himself for months, now spoken as Rosalyn's idea. 
IRVING ROSENFELD OK. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Just think about it. (kisses him) These things are never easy. 
Irving starts walking away towards the door. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Alright. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD Irving. Good luck with your plan. 
EXT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY - DAY 
The spare rhythmic intro of Jeff Lynne's "Long Black Road" plays as Richie looks back over his shoulder and walks towards the building with intensity. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) Necessity truly is the mother of invention. The F.B.I. was willing to wire the two million dollars if it meant taking down Tellegio and his entire organization. 
INT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY 
Brenda in her office. 
Amado looking very pleased on the telephone.

Irving walks with Richie and Sydney up to an office building. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) A mobster like Tellegio would never meet at the Plaza Hotel, but only at the office of his attorney, Alfonse Simone. 
They walk into mob lawyer Simone's building. 
178B   INT. LOBBY OF BUILDING - DAY                                    178B

178D   INT. RECEPTION AREA - SIMONE LAW OFFICE - DAY                   178D 
They open door to large, spare reception area of Alfonse Simone's law office. MIDDLE AGED SECRETARY looks up and picks up the phone. 
A smile creeps across Richie's face. 
RICHIE DIMASO Thank you. Thank you for clarifying that. 
Richie picks up the phone to dial. 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) I think that will be OK for the Sheik. 
INT. BRENDA'S FBI WIRE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
AMADO, STODDARD, BRENDA. 
ANTHONY AMADO This is the Sheik. 
RICHIE DIMASO (on phone) Mr. Tellegio is not here. It's just Mr. Alfonse Simone, his lawyer. Are we still ok to wire the money? 
ALFONSE SIMONE Simone can take the money. What's the number? 
RICHIE DIMASO 5317AP 
Amado writes it down and hands it to Brenda to call in. 
BRENDA The funds have been transferred. 
ANTHONY AMADO (on phone to Richie) The funds have been transferred. 
Amado nods: victory. BACK TO: 
INT. ALFONSE SIMONE'S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
Richie hangs up. 
RICHIE DIMASO The money's been wired. 
ALFONSE SIMONE I think we have a deal. 
RICHIE DIMASO Yes we do sir. 
ALFONSE SIMONE Pleasure doing business with you. 
RICHIE DIMASO Okay, well, thank you very much, Mr. Simone. 
RICHIE SMILES, SYDNEY LOOKS AT IRVING, WHO LOOKS PREOCCUPIED. PUSH IN ON IRVING. 
RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) The Sheik's very excited. 
ALFONSE SIMONE I'm sure that we'll be seeing each other. 
Richie and team start to walk out. 
RICHIE DIMASO (grinning) Oh I'm sure we'll be seeing each other very soon. You may even get sick of me, like these two. 
ALFONSE SIMONE I don't think I'll get sick of you. Nice meeting you. 
Richie, Edith, and Irving walk down the hall after leaving his office. Richie smiles as the opening of Bowie's "The Jean Genie" momentously starts. Edith smiles as she walks down the hall followed by Irving. Richie puts his hand on the door knob to exit the hallway. 
178H   INT. AMADO'S OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING - DAY              178H 
THE DOOR OPENS IN A TIMECUT, RICHIE IN SUNGLASSES, HIS JACKET IS OFF, HE BEAMS AND CELEBRATES AND EXHORTS A ROOM FULL OF FBI AGENTS, ADMINISTRATORS, SECRETARIES. 
THE JEAN GENIE PLAYS ENERGETICALLY AS RICHIE CELEBRATES WITH EVERYONE, LIKE IN A LOCKER ROOM, HIS FIST IN THE AIR. 
RICHIE DIMASO FINALLY! FINALLY WE GET SOME RESPECT! 
AMADO SITS IN HIS CHAIR WITH CIGAR IN ONE HAND AND DRINK IN THE OTHER. VERY EXCITED AND LAUGHING AS HE POINTS AT RICHIE. 
ANTHONY AMADO (shouts through clamor) We're ambitious, that's why! 
Richie suddenly moves to the reel to reel surveillance tape and quiets the room, the music momentarily stops as we hear Alfonse Simone on the surveillance tape. 
RICHIE DIMASO Shh, shh, shh! 
ALFONSE SIMONE (ON SURVEILLANCE TAPE) If we have to pay somebody off, we'll pay somebody off. If we have to lean on somebody, intimidate somebody, we'll intimidate somebody. 
Richie joyfully lip synchs to the rhythm of Simone's incriminating words on tape. 
RICHIE DIMASO (in unison with Simone on tape) -- If we have to lean on somebody, intimate somebody, we'll intimidate somebody!! 
RICHIE THROWS HIS FIST IN THE AIR AND CHEERS, JOINED BY EVERYONE IN THE ROOM. BOWIES "THE JENE GENIE" COMES BACK LOUD. 
179   RICHIE TURNS AND TWIRLS A WHITE HAIRED FBI AGENT IN            179 CELEBRATION, LAUGHING WITH JOY. THEN GOES OVER TO A SULKING STODDARD AND HUMPS HIM LIKE AT A FRAT PARTY, LAUGHING WITH EVERYBODY AT STODDARD'S STIFFNESS. STODDARD GETS UP AND RICHIE SMACKS HIS ASS AS HE LEAVES THE ROOM. RICHIE IMITATES STODDARD TO ROARING LAUGHTER -- TWICE. 
THE MUSIC CRESCENDOS TO AN ABRUPT STOP. 
180   EXT. CARMINE POLITO'S CAMDEN NJ CLAPBOARD HOME - DAY            180 
Irving's big blue car pulls up to the lens. Irving and Sydney looking a little uneasy. 
Irving stares at the house. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I gotta do it. 
181   INT. CARMINE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY                                181 
CARMINE POLITO What do you mean, there's no sheik? What does that mean, "there's no sheik"? What does that mean? 
Carmine stares at Irving. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I want to face you like a man because I want to be real now. 
CARMINE POLITO Who is "they"? 
SYDNEY PROSSER Just rest. 
She gets in and closes the door. 
185   INT. IRVING'S CADILLAC - DAY                                   185 
They both slump down on the seat, stare at each other, emotional, humbled. Sydney gently removes Irving's broken glasses. They stare at each other, it is quiet. 
SYDNEY PROSSER (emotional, quiet) Are you ready? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Yes. 
They stare at each other. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) (whispers) I love you. 
She squeezes his hand, raises it to her lips and kisses it. 
206   INT. AMADO'S OFFICE - DAY                                      206 
TILT UP FROM THE FLOOR OF THE OFFICE TO RICHIE, AMADO, AND STODDARD INTENSELY STARING AT THE DOOR FOR A CONFRONTATION, LIKE IN A WESTERN. THE DOOR OPENS AS IRVING AND SYDNEY ENTER AND STARE BACK AT THEM. 
ANTHONY AMADO Please. Come in. Sit down. 
They all sit. 
ANTHONY AMADO (CONT'D) Do you know where our two million dollars is? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Two million? (Irving pushes his new glasses up the bridge of his nose) It's with Victor Tellegio and Alfonse Simone. 
ANTHONY AMADO No, actually it's not with Victor Tellegio or Alfonse Simone. 
Richie stands by the window, stares angrily at Irving. 
RICHIE DIMASO He fucking knows about it. 
ANTHONY AMADO It's gone missing. Did you know that? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Where's it gone? 
ANTHONY AMADO That's interesting that you said that because while you were on your way over here, we got an anonymous phone call from someone who said that in exchange for immunity for the two of you and a reduced sentence for Carmine Polito we get our two million dollars back. 
IRVING ROSENFELD That's interesting. That's very interesting. I have no idea. 
ANTHONY AMADO No idea? 
IRVING ROSENFELD No idea what you're talking about. 
Irving looks at Sydney who looks back at him and shakes her head. She doesn't know either. 
ANTHONY AMADO I got it. I understand how these deals are made. See, someone has leverage. 
RICHIE DIMASO Anthony, fuck them. It's over. We got them for wire fraud, it's over. (to Irving and Sydney) You're done. You're both done. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I don't think so. 
RICHIE DIMASO Oh, you don't think so? 
IRVING ROSENFELD Richard, think about it, YOU requested the two million. And you gave Brenda the account number. We didn't do any of that. None of it. (turns dramatically to face Richie) How do we know that YOU don't have the money? 
RICHIE DIMASO (Richie looks from Irving to Sydney) Am I living in a fucking nightmare right now? 
AMADO AND STODDARD STARE INCRIMINATINGLY AT RICHIE. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I find this a little offensive. Really, I find this a little offensive and I don't see that you got any sort of solid case against-- 
RICHIE DIMASO (to Amado and Stoddard) Don't let him get in your heads. Listen to me, we're dealing with a very clever individual. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Richard, think about it. You got some big arrests. You got U.S. Congressmen. You look good. You're gonna be all over the news. You know what doesn't look good? A story about gross incompetence 
205                                                    SMASH TO:    205

RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D) I'm sorry, do I have the wrong office?(checks number on the door) Is this 701? Alfonse Simone? 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) This is 701.

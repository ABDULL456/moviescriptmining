Insomnia 
by 
H. Seitz 
FADE IN: 
On credit sequence... 
AN ARM 
stretched out.  Long, alabaster white.  Beautiful.  A WASH CLOTH enters frame.  Starts washing the arm with long, tender strokes. 
A TUMBLE OF HAIR 
thick and auburn.  Being gently washed. 
FINGERNAILS 
being clipped with a shiny nail clipper.  Short.  Uniform. Tidy. 
EYEBROWS 
brown with a touch of gold.  A BRUSH comes into view. Brushes against the eyebrow hair, then back again.  Against. Then back again. 
PANTY-HOSE 
pulled gingerly off a long leg.  Folded neatly.  The wash cloth begins between the toes.  Warm, soapy water. 
HAIR 
now dry.  The HAND appears with a comb.  Pulls down through the thick tresses. 
It is only now that we see the hand is wearing a SURGICAL GLOVE. 
The gloved hand holds up the comb and pulls stray hairs from it.  Places them in a big, clear, plastic bag.  In the bag we see the panty-hose, a folded flower dress, the nail clippings. 
Goes back to combing.  Comes across a knot and yanks the comb through.  The HEAD rolls over to us.  Her face is bruised, her eyes blank.  She is lying on the floor. 
Dead. 
End of credit sequence. 
INT. BUSH PLANE - THE KILBUCK MOUNTAINS, ALASKA - DAY 
The loud THRUM of a bush plane.  We CLOSE ON a small, cloudy window.  Through it we see an endless expanse of pine trees. 
HAP (O.S.) Jesus.  Just look at all that. 
PULL BACK to reveal HAP ECKHART and WILL DORMER sitting side by side.  Hap's at the window.  Greying moustache, a little pudgy, wearing a brown suit.  Holding a folded over Seattle Times. 
HAP (cont'd) I thought we had a population problem. Everyone should just move up here. (taps window) Just look at it, Will. 
Will's eyes remain on the file on his lap. 
WILL I don't need to look at it. 
Will Dormer.  Tall, handsome, expensively tailored suit. Snakeskin cowboy boots.  There's both a magnetism and a distance to him.  An intense mixture.  Hap glances at him. 
HAP Nothing wrong with smelling the roses. 
Will looks up.  We see the trace of a thick, ropy SCAR by his Adam's apple.  There's tension between him and Hap, just below the surface.  He taps the file. 
WILL Tell that to her, partner. 
ANGLE ON THE FILE 
a stack of 8x10 PHOTOGRAPHS.  Of the dead girl.  Her eyes puffed up from bruises.  The whites bloody.  Contusions along her breasts and shoulders. 
PILOT (O.S.) Detective? 
The PILOT's looking back at Will.  Wearing a leather red baron hat. 
PILOT (cont'd) Better check your belts.  We'll be landing in about fifteen minutes. 
Will nods.  The plane lurches.  The file falls to the floor and the photographs scatter.  The pilot catches a glimpse of them.  Looks at Will. 
EXT. BUSH PLANE - CONTINUOUS 
The small yellow plane veers left.  Clears a mountain top and gives view to the spectacular Alaskan coastline.  The green of the Bering sea, the blanket of pine trees, the jagged rock of the beaches.  Enormous. 
EXT. LANDING STRIP - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY 
A SIGN swinging in the wind: Nightmute, Alaska.  Halibut Fishing Capital of the World! 
PULL BACK to reveal it hanging from the eave of a small, corrugated building.  The "airport."  Nothing else for miles around. 
A mud-splattered Jeep Cherokee pulls up next to it.  Brakes SCREECHING.  A YOUNG WOMAN hops out.  About 23.  Petite with short, brown hair. 
Peers up at the sky.  Brightens at the sight of the BUSH PLANE coming in for landing.  Smooths down her down vest. Making sure the GOLD SHIELD on her belt's visible.  Nervous. Excited. 
OLD MAN (O.S.) Eleanor? 
ELLIE BURR turns.  Shields her eyes from the sun.  An OLD MAN hosing down the side of the building. 
ELLIE Hey, Mr. Angstrom! 
MR. ANGSTROM What're you doing here? 
Ellie puffs up. 
ELLIE Police business. 
WILL What time was that? 
FRED Around twelve-thirty. 
Hap picks up a bear on Kay's bed.  A bell JINGLES when he shakes it.  Will crosses to a closet in the corner. 
WILL Who was the last one to see her alive? 
FRED Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything. 
Will pulls a dress out of the closet.  Small, black, elegant. The tag's been cut out.  He pulls out another, then another. Feels the fabric. 
WILL These are designer.  Expensive. (looks up) Could Randy Stetz afford these? 
Fred and Ellie exchange a look. 
ELLIE He fixes boat engines. 
Will looks around.  Cheap wallpaper, torn window screens. 
WILL Well her mother didn't buy them for her. 
HAP What are we thinking? 
Will reaches over to a heart-shaped box on the bedside table. Pulls out a pretty gold necklace.  Holds it up. 
WILL Kay Connell had an admirer. 
He hands the dresses to Ellie.  Heads out of the room. 
WILL (cont'd) I want to talk to the boyfriend. 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 
CLOSE ON a hand squeezing a shoulder.  Hard. 
WILL You don't seem all that sad. 
The shoulder jerks away.  PULL BACK to reveal RANDY STETZ sitting at a wooden table in an interrogation room.  Longish blond hair, wearing a Metallica t-shirt, trying like hell to grow a moustache. 
RANDY I haven't had a chance!  You fuckers been all over my back since Monday! 
He takes out a cigarette.  It's bent.  He lights it.  Hap sits opposite. 
HAP You know smoking stunts your growth. 
Randy throws him a look. 
RANDY Yeah, okay, fat-ass. 
HAP (smiles at Will) More Alaskan hospitality. 
Will goes over to a coffee machine.  Pours a cup. 
WILL Did you love her? 
RANDY Huh? 
WILL Kay Connell.  Did you love her? 
Randy flicks his ash.  Shrugs. 
RANDY Sure.  She was nice. 
Will turns with his coffee. 
WILL "She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back? 
RANDY Huh? 
WILL You heard me that time. 
RANDY She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night. 
WILL But she was seeing someone else on the side. 
Randy glares. 
RANDY I don't know what you're fucking talking about. 
WILL Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about? 
RANDY Stuff. 
WILL What kind of stuff? 
RANDY Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember. 
WILL The other guy? 
RANDY I told you I don't remember. 
WILL After that she left the party to go to him. 
RANDY How should I know?... 
WILL Ran like hell to go to him... 
RANDY Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions... 
Will suddenly hurls his coffee cup and grabs Randy up by the collar.  Nose to nose. 
WILL Now you listen to me, you little shit. This fuck-the-world-Metallica-t-shirt crap may work with your mamma, but it doesn't work with me.  You got mad at your girlfriend because she was seeing someone else.  You want to be the last person who saw her alive or are you going to tell me who that is? 
WILL Where is it? 
Ellie, Fred, and a couple other GUYS huddled around a desk. 
ELLIE Over here. 
Will and Hap head over to them.  One of the younger guys, FARRELL, intimidated by Will's presence.  Tucks his shirt into his dirty jeans. 
They part to reveal a BLUE KNAPSACK laying on the desk.  Mud spots all over it.  An embroidered daisy.  Will examines it. 
WILL We're sure it's hers? 
FRED Has her books in it. 
HAP What about prints? 
Ellie shakes her head, unfortunately not.  Will reaches into the bag.  Pulls out two text books. 
WILL Biology and Algebra. 
He shoves the books towards one of the guys. 
WILL (cont'd) Find out who she studied with. 
He continues through the bag.  Pulls out a little plastic bag with "Hello Kittys" all over it.  Dumps out the contents. 
WILL (cont'd) Make-up. 
Looks up at Fred. 
WILL (cont'd) Find out where she bought it. 
Fred looks at him.  Not happy with make-up duty.  Will pulls out a hair brush.  Hands it to Ellie. 
WILL (cont'd) Lab. 
Next, a couple worn paperbacks. 
WILL (cont'd) (reading titles) Otherwise Engaged, Murder at Sunset. 
He looks up at the group. 
WILL (cont'd) Who here reads this kind of crap? 
Farrell straightens. 
FARRELL I read that kind of crap. 
Will tosses them to him. 
WILL Read them.  Tell me anything that strikes you. 
Down to the bottom of the bag.  A Ziploc with a half-eaten sandwich and an apple core.  Will hands them to Ellie. 
WILL (cont'd) Lab. 
Upends the knapsack.  Scraps, paper clips, gum wrappers. 
WILL (cont'd) That's it. 
Fred reaches for the knapsack. 
FRED I'll stick it in the evidence locker... 
WILL No. 
Will takes it, walks slowly over to the window.  Thinking. Twists the knapsack in his hands and looks out at the 
TOTEM POLE standing tall outside.  A black RAVEN alights on top of it.  Pecks at the air.  Turns.  Seems to look right at Will. 
WILL (cont'd) We put it back where we found it. 
Will turns to them. 
WILL (cont'd) You said it was a fishing cabin. 
FARRELL Uh, right.  About two miles outside of town. 
ELLIE On the beach. 
Fred tightens his jaw. 
FRED Why are we taking it back? 
Will ignores the question.  Walks back towards them. 
WILL This murder was in the papers, right? 
ELLIE Yeah.  All over. 
WILL Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet. (checks watch) We can get it in by the morning editions. 
He hands the bag to Farrell. 
WILL (cont'd) Fill this with random books.  Make it look heavy. 
Will pulls out a handkerchief.  Wipes the mud off his hands. Taking his time.  Finally turns to Fred. 
WILL (cont'd) It'll eat this guy alive if he thinks he overlooked a detail. 
EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING 
POV through BINOCULARS 
WILL (cont'd) Go! 
They rush out the door and split directions.  Will crouches down by the trap door and... 
INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS 
...drops down into a dark, dank TUNNEL.  Water dripping. FOOTFALLS echoing.  Will cocks his head.  Left or right? Starts sprinting down towards the lighter end of the tunnel, his own footsteps bouncing against the tunnel walls.  He rounds a curve.  Sound recedes... 
EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS 
...He exits the tunnel onto the rocky beach.  Stops short. 
FOG 
has enveloped everything - obscuring all vision, dulling all sound.  Like a strange dream.  Eerie. 
Will blinks against the thick whiteness.  Strains to hear any sound, anything.  There's only the distant LAPPING of the water. 
He tightens his grip on his gun and plunges into the fog. Quick, careful steps.  Stumbles over a rock.  Waves his gun in defense.  Eyes wide open like a blind man... 
SUDDENLY 
a GUNSHOT.  Off to the right.  Will whips his head around. 
EXT. UP ON THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS 
Ellie, alone, jumps at the sound.  Reaches for her weapon... 
EXT. DOWN THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS 
Will heads towards the sound.  Reaching out for approaching rocks.  Scrambles over a small bank and finds... 
FARRELL rolled up into a fetal position on the ground. Clutching his thigh.  Blood seeping through his fingers.  He looks up. 
FARRELL Sorry about... 
WILL Where is he? 
Farrell can't answer that. 
WILL (cont'd) (impatient) Where'd the shot come from? 
Farrell lifts his bloody hand.  Points off towards the water. 
FARRELL Over there. 
Will disappears back into the fog, leaving Farrell behind. 
Clambers back down towards the water, pausing every few seconds to listen, to adjust.  Heart POUNDING.  Blood pumping.  Like an animal tracking its prey.  Leaps up onto a plateau of rocks when... 
SUDDENLY 
a DARK FIGURE 
flashes past him.  The killer!  Inches away.  Will wheels around... 
WILL Freeze! 
CRACK!  Squeezes off a shot.  Misses!  Can't believe it. Goes for another... Nothing!  Jammed!  The figure, disappearing.  Will tosses his Smith and Wesson, reaches behind his back and whips out his SMITH 39/13... 
EXT. UP ON THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS 
Ellie, weapon drawn, making her way down the rocks.  A HAND suddenly grabs her arm. 
VOICE (O.S.) Dammit, Ellie!... 
Fred emerges from the fog. 
FRED (cont'd) Put that thing away!  Farrell's down!... 
CRACK! as another shot rips through the air.  Fred and Ellie freeze. 
EXT. DOWN BY THE WATER - MINUTES LATER 
Fred and Ellie, skittering down the rocks.  Getting closer to the water.  Hear a voice ring out... 
VOICE (O.S.) Hap! 
The fog starts to dissipate.  They reach the water to see... 
WILL DORMER 
kneeling beside the body of his partner.  Lying in the water. Shot in the stomach.  Blood dribbling from his mouth.  Will grabs him up by the collar. 
WILL Hap! 
Starts shaking the limp body.  Teeth clenched. 
WILL (cont'd) Hap! 
Hap's head, rolls back.  Mouth agape.  Face white... 
Will, rips off his tie.  Presses it to the gaping wound... trying to stop the bleeding...warm blood, pumping into the water... 
Ellie watches.  Horrified.  Fred races over to the body. Feels for Hap's pulse. 
FRED Dormer... 
Will, shaking Hap again.  Jaw set.  Eyes intense.  Veins popping up along his temples.  Fred catches his shoulder. 
FRED (cont'd) Dormer!  He's gone. 
Will looks up at Fred.  His face contorts. 
It clicks off abruptly.  Rachel appears in the doorway. Takes in the blood on Will's shirt. 
RACHEL I'm sorry about your partner. 
Will looks at her.  She walks over to the desk. 
RACHEL (cont'd) It's been on the radio for the last two hours.  Nothing but that.  Like when they found Kay Connell's body. (sympathetic smile) We're not used to this sort of thing up here. 
She reaches for his key. 
RACHEL (cont'd) He was standing right there just a couple of days ago.  Your partner.  Exactly where you are now. (beat) I hope I was nice to him. 
Will takes his key. 
WILL You were nice to him.  He liked you. 
He smiles faintly, turns to go.  Just then the phone RINGS. 
RACHEL (answering) Pioneer Lodge?... (listens) Hold on a second.  He's right here. 
Will stops.  Turns.  Rachel holds up the phone.  Covering the mouthpiece. 
RACHEL (cont'd) John Warfield.  He's called a couple of times. 
Will's stomach drops.  That's the last phone call in the world he wants to take.  Rachel reads his face. 
RACHEL (cont'd) Want me to lie? 
Will shakes his head.  Steps back and takes the phone. Clears his throat. 
WILL (into phone) Dormer. 
PAUSE.  A bemused VOICE on the other end. 
WARFIELD'S VOICE Detective Dormer.  I've been trying to reach you.  I was very sorry to hear about your partner, Detective Eckhart. It must have been a terrible shock, what happened this morning. 
Will.  Not giving this asshole an inch.  Rachel, trying not to listen. 
WILL (into phone) That's not exactly how I'd put it. 
WARFIELD'S VOICE (cont'd) No, no.  I suppose not.  But I look forward to reading the report.  Very sad.  Very sad.  Funny... 
WILL (into phone) What do you mean, "Funny?" 
WARFIELD'S VOICE Oh, nothing.  Just that I felt Detective Eckhart and I, Hap and I, were starting to make a real connection before you left.  I sensed that he was ready to get some things off his chest.  Did you sense anything like that, Detective?  I mean, as his partner?... 
Will, squeezing the phone cord with his bloody fist. 
WARFIELD'S VOICE (cont'd) ...You were his partner for, what, about ten years?... 
Will turns from Rachel.  Eyes burning.  Voice steady. 
WILL (into phone) You know why everyone hates you, Warfield?  It's not your questions, it's not your press conferences, it's not even your cheap suits; everyone hates you 'cause day after day you suck the marrow out of real cops when you never had the balls to become one yourself.  Well I got to tell you, it's a shame you're not up here with me because I'd love to show you right now just what a real cop is capable of.  You just remember that when you're sitting at your bullshit desk reading your bullshit report on my dead partner! 
SLAM!  He hangs up the phone.  Runs his hand through his hair.  Turns back to Rachel. 
WILL (cont'd) Next time.  Go ahead and lie. 
EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING 
Fog everywhere.  Dense.  White.  Suffocating. 
We're running through it.  Clambering over rocks.  Hearing the sound of our own BREATHING.  Our own HEARTBEAT. Adrenaline pumping.  An animal tracking its prey... 
SUDDENLY a DARK FIGURE 
flashes past.  Just inches away.  Playing with us.  Taunting us.  We whip round with our weapon and... 
INT. WILL'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT 
BANG!  Will bolts upright in bed.  A film of sweat over his body.  Breathing hard.  The sound that woke him: the window shade FLAPPING open.  LIGHT floods the room. 
Will gets up.  Goes over to the shade and pulls it down.  It lurches up halfway.  He tugs it down again.  It slaps all the way open.  Will yanks it down so hard it rips off the window. 
WILL Goddammit! 
He gets tangled in it. 
WILL (cont'd) Goddamned...thing! 
Pulls it off and flings it in the corner. 
INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:22 A.M. 
The digital clock flips to a new minute:  4:23.  Will, pacing.  Scratching at his stubble.  Unable to sleep.  Keeps stepping on a SQUEAKY floorboard. 
Slows near the ADJOINING DOOR that leads into Hap's room. Hovers.  Lightly pushes the door open.  Sees... 
THE PICTURES on the bedside table.  A WOMAN and three teenage GIRLS.  Hap's family. 
INT. BATHROOM - 5:18 A.M. 
Water gushing out of the faucet.  Will's WATCH sitting on the sink's edge.  5:18. 
Will reaches up into the open medicine cabinet for a bottle of aspirin.  Shakes out a couple.  Cups his hand under the water and knocks the pills back. 
Closes the medicine cabinet and CRIES out... 
HAP'S REFLECTION 
looming behind him. 
HAP They're watching us, Will... 
He stops chewing.  Realises the association.  Swallows uncomfortably. 
FARRELL (cont'd) Oh.  I'm sorry.  About Hap.  Detective Eckhart. 
WILL Thanks. 
FARRELL I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something. 
WILL He would have liked that. 
FARRELL We just gotta catch the bastard, right? 
WILL That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell. 
FARRELL What I saw? 
WILL Anything.  It's important. 
Farrell takes another bite of the Snickers.  Like a little boy.  Furrows his brow, trying to remember. 
FARRELL Pretty much nothing.  That fog was so thick.  The bullet seemed to come out of nowhere.  I don't even remember seeing any shapes.  Then I saw you.  But only when you came up close.  Then you disappeared again. (shrugs) I guess I heard more than I saw. 
Will sighs, rubs his eyes. 
FARRELL (cont'd) Sorry. 
WILL No.  No.  Don't be sorry.  It's not your fault. 
Just then a NURSE comes in with a Dixie cup.  Pretty, freckled face.  Not much older than Kay Connell. 
NURSE Time for your meds. 
Farrell smiles at her, winks at Will. 
FARRELL Lonnie and I went to high school together. 
Lonnie gives him the cup. 
LONNIE Just take the pills, Farrell. 
WILL How's the leg? 
FARRELL Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through. 
WILL Right.  Got lost in the rocks. 
FARRELL We'll get the other one, though. 
Will looks up.  Farrell pops the rest of the Snickers in his mouth. 
FARRELL (cont'd) After the autopsy. 
INT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - LATER 
Will walks down the hallway.  Light pouring in from a set of high windows.  He looks tired.  Set-upon. 
POV of SOMEONE 
WATCHING HIM.  From a doorway.  Not close, not far.  A HAND comes into view.  Small.  Bruised knuckles.  Holds on to the door jamb.  Watches as... 
Will suddenly stops.  Skin prickling at the back of his neck. Turns and looks around. 
A MAN in a wheelchair. 
A LITTLE GIRL tugging at her hospital gown. 
A couple of NURSES laughing at check-in. 
An empty doorway. 
Nothing. 
EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING 
Back at the beach.  We see nothing but fog.  A VOICE comes through. 
ELLIE (O.S.) ...and it was at this point that Detective Dormer headed towards the noise... 
Ellie emerges from the fog.  Carrying the map and talking into a small tape recorder.  She's climbing over the rocks, wearing a windbreaker a couple sizes too big. 
A UNIFORMED OFFICER follows, carrying a camera.  She turns to him. 
ELLIE (cont'd) Remember, Kepp, shoot everything... (back to the tape recorder) ...wherein he discovered the wounded Detective Farrell Brooks, having been shot in the vastus externus of the upper left thigh... 
She climbs over the same bank Will Dormer climbed two evenings before.  Finds... 
ANOTHER UNIFORMED OFFICER, hanging out and smoking. 
ELLIE (cont'd) Francis! 
He looks up.  Pimples on his chin. 
FRANCIS What? 
ELLIE You're supposed to be Farrell.  Shot in the thigh and writhing in pain. 
FRANCIS C'mon, Ellie.  What's it matter? 
ELLIE Accuracy.  That's what. (points to the ground) Now get down. 
Francis looks up at her.  Flicks his cigarette away and gets down amongst the rocks.  Holds his thigh like he was shot. 
FRANCIS Ow. 
RACHEL I got it. (smiles) Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years. 
WILL Habit. 
Rachel looks at him.  Can't figure this guy out.  Remembers something. 
RACHEL (cont'd) Oh.  A man came by to see you earlier. Said he was your new partner. 
A TINGLE skips down Will's spine.  He looks at her. 
WILL Fred Duggar? 
RACHEL No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him. 
WILL I'm not expecting anyone. 
RACHEL That's not what he thinks. 
WILL What did he look like? 
Rachel thinks for a second.  Leaning against the clock. 
RACHEL Short.  Dark hair.  Not that memorable. 
Will nods, rubs his forehead.  Suddenly has a pounding headache.  Turns for the stairs.  Hesitates. 
WILL I need to borrow something. 
INT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON a nail.  One THWACK of a hammer and it bites into the wall.  PULL BACK to reveal Will nailing the corner of a blanket to one side of the window.  An ad hoc curtain. 
He finishes that side.  Starts to stretch the blanket across the window.  Hesitates.  Looks outside.  To the left.  To the right.  To see if anybody's out there.  If anybody's watching.  Sees instead... 
A LONE TUGBOAT chugging across the harbor.  Pulling a huge freighter.  Will squeezes his eyes shut.  Opens them again. Pulls the blanket fully across the window. 
INT. WILL'S ROOM - 1:05 A.M. 
The FILES spread across the floor.  Their edges buckled from the rain.  Dozens of pictures of Kay Connell.  School records.  Private letters.  Health files.  Coroner's report. 
Will.  Pacing.  Back and forth.  Thinking.  Over that same SQUEAKY floorboard.  The clock reads: 1:05. 
INT. WILL'S ROOM - 2:20 A.M. 
Will lying in bed.  On top of the blanket.  Wide awake. Staring at the ADJOINING DOOR.  Into Hap's room. 
EXT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - LATE NIGHT 
Will, in a sweatshirt and coat, heads down the front steps of the Pioneer Lodge.  Jams his hands in his pockets.  The walk of an insomniac. 
EXT. MAINSTREET - NIGHTMUTE - LATE NIGHT 
Will walking down main street.  In the middle of the road. The dead of night.  No cars.  The sky a blinding white. 
Hears some rowdy NOISE coming from a corner bar, beer lights flickering.  A WOMAN rides by on a bicycle.  Birds SINGING. 
Not day.  Not night.  Stuck somewhere in between.  Like a dream. 
Turns down a side street.  Passing more stores.  Guns and Ammo.  Patty's Hair and Nails.  General Store.  Comes upon 
THE ALLEY 
where he vomited the day before.  Stops.  Sees the DEAD DOG, still down at the end.  Half obscured by the dumpster. 
Will wavers, pale.  Suddenly... 
A HOMELESS MAN emerges from the shadows.  Big.  Wild-eyed. Awakened from his sleep.  Will, quickly backtracks to the sidewalk.  Spooked. 
JUST THEN the CRACK! of bat hitting ball.  He turns.  In the distance.  Nightmute Elementary School. 
EXT. NIGHTMUTE ELEMENTARY - LATE NIGHT 
A Little League game in full swing.  The uniforms, a little faded.  The diamond, a little unkempt.  A smattering of SPECTATORS.  Mostly dads with six-packs. 
Will wanders over to the fence.  Spots Ellie sitting alone on the bottom bleacher. 
CUT TO: 
POV OF SOMEONE 
WATCHING HIM.  From afar.  The SOUNDS of the game, delayed a few seconds.  Watches as Will crosses to the bleachers... 
CUT BACK TO: 
...and sits down next to Ellie.  She turns, surprised. 
ELLIE (cont'd) Detective Dormer!  What are you doing here? (looks at watch) It's two-thirty in the morning. Shouldn't you be asleep? 
Will glances out at the game. 
WILL I could say the same thing about you. 
ELLIE Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time. 
WILL Who's playing? 
ELLIE The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year. 
She sips on a take-out coke.  Looks back at the game.  A plump, redheaded GIRL comes up to bat.  Blows a bubble. 
ELLIE That's my sister. 
Will looks over just in time to see the girl swing and miss by a mile.  Ellie cups her hands around her mouth. 
CORONER You're looking a little green, Detective. 
INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY 
Fred Duggar, dialing the phone at his cluttered desk. 
WILL (O.S.) So where's the other bullets? 
He looks up.  Will standing before him, holding the manila envelope. 
INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY 
CLOSE on a key slipping into a padlock.  Opens with a CLICK! 
PULL BACK to reveal Fred and Will in a small storage room. Standing in front of an army-green LOCKER.  The evidence locker.  Room's stuffed with old files and boxes.  MOOSE ANTLERS hanging over a small window.  Will glances up. 
WILL What's with all the moose antlers around here? 
Fred throws a look over his shoulder.  Opens the locker. 
FRED Lots of moose. 
INSIDE THE LOCKER - another manila envelope.  The name on this one: Farrell Brooks. 
Fred reaches back for the other envelope.  Will, hesitant to give it to him.  Feeling the bump of the bullet in the bottom corner.  Hands it over.  Wipes his brow. 
WILL When's Rich coming? 
Fred slides it in beside Farrell's.  Closes the locker door. 
FRED I'll call him now. 
WILL First I need a copy of the key. 
Fred turns, a twinkle in his eye. 
FRED This isn't Seattle, Detective.  We don't have copies. (holds up key) This is the only one. 
Will looks at him.  At the key.  Plucks it from his hand. Just then Nyback's SECRETARY appears in the doorway. 
SECRETARY Detective Dormer?  Telephone. 
INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY 
The secretary hands Will the phone.  Pulls something from under the desk.  A beat-up BOX.  Will's name on it. 
SECRETARY This came for you earlier. 
Will glances at it.  Takes the phone.  Rubs his eyes. 
WILL (into phone) Dormer. 
Nothing.  Someone's there but they're not saying anything. Will, too tired for this shit... 
WILL (cont'd) Goddammit, Warfield, if you're gonna check up on me every... 
Then...the VOICE.  A MAN's voice.  Not John Warfield's. This voice is medium-ranged.  Higher.  Nose sounds stuffed. 
MAN'S VOICE I bet you haven't been getting much sleep. 
Will straightens.  Something weird. 
WILL (into phone) What? 
A little TITTER on the other end. 
MAN'S VOICE You lower-48s.  You think the white nights are kind of neat.  Then you can't sleep for days.  I've seen it happen about a million times.  But you can't sleep for a different reason. 
WILL (into phone) Who is this? 
A PAUSE.  Will loosens his tie. 
WILL (into phone) I said, who is this? 
The voice.  Dropping to a WHISPER. 
MAN'S VOICE I saw what really happened, Will... 
Will, furrows his brow. 
MAN'S VOICE I saw you kill your partner.  With your back-up weapon.  Out there on the beach. I saw you shoot him dead... 
CLOSE ON 
Will Dormer's face. 
As all the blood drains from it. 
As all SOUND 
fades around him. 
As his heart 
begins to POUND against his chest. 
He falters, reaching out for the desk.  To steady himself. As if the floor's just dropped out beneath him.  Eyes, darting around the bullpen... 
WILL (sotto, into phone) Now you listen to me... 
MAN'S VOICE Don't worry.  I won't tell anyone.  Oh, and I saw you take my gun.  My uncle's old 357.  I dropped it in the rocks. But you can go ahead and keep that. 
CHIEF NYBACK, exits his office.  Looks at Will and smiles. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY 
...steps into the HALLWAY leading towards the bullpen.  Hears VOICES.  Nearby.  Ducks back.  Waiting for them to fade. 
Safe.  Heads down towards the STORAGE ROOM.  Glancing briefly at the PICTURES hanging on the wall.  Of old time POLICE OFFICERS.  Striking brave poses... 
INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY 
The storage room.  Hot.  Stifling.  The moose antlers LOOMING over his shoulder.  Will pulls the evidence locker key from his pocket.  Unlocks the padlock.  Swings the door open. 
Pulls the Hap Eckhart envelope out.  Throwing a look over his shoulder.  Opens it.  Shakes out the bullet that was lodged in Hap's spine.  Then fishes a plastic bag from his pocket. The bullet he shot into the dead dog.  Drops that into the envelope and reseals it.  Hands shaking. 
Something.  Catches the corner of his eye.  He turns. 
HIS REFLECTION in the locker mirror.  The blood smear still on his forehead. 
FRED (O.S.) Dormer... 
Will jumps.  Quickly wipes the smear off and turns.  Fred Duggar standing behind him.  RICH by his side.  Will clears his throat, shoves Hap's envelope into Fred's hand.  Then Farrell's.  Angry. 
WILL These should have gone out two hours ago. 
SLAMS the locker door and brushes past him.  Fred and Rich exchange a glance. 
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHTMUTE - DAY 
CLOSE ON a YOUNG GIRL's face.  Dark hair held up in two barrettes, wind tousling the curls.  Reading from a piece of paper. 
YOUNG GIRL ...And that's how I think Kay would want us to remember her... 
PULL BACK to reveal Kay Connell's funeral.  PEOPLE standing by the grave, most of them HIGH SCHOOLERS.  The sky's a brilliant blue.  Red fireweeds blanket the hillside. 
YOUNG GIRL (cont'd) ...Swimming, reading, hiking through the Kebaughs... 
FRED, ELLIE AND WILL 
stand off to the side.  Dressed in black.  Fred looks like he's never worn a tie before.  Ellie holds a potted plant.  A gift for the bereaved. 
YOUNG GIRL (cont'd) ...playing her flute, meeting at Darrow's after school... 
Will.  Eyes bloodshot.  Not really listening.  Not really paying attention.  A thousand miles away.  Tugs at his collar.  Feels tight. 
YOUNG GIRL ...And always, always with a smile on her face. 
The young girl looks up.  Folds the paper closed.  People SNIFFLE.  Mrs. Connell, reaches out to squeeze her arm. 
Some CHILDREN.  Start circulating with plastic buckets. Filled with white carnations.  Handing them out. 
VOICE (O.S.) Want one? 
Will, startled, looks down.  A LITTLE GIRL stands before him. Curly hair.  Glasses.  Holding up a bucket.  He shakes his head.  Looks back up at 
THE MOURNERS lining up to place the carnations on Kay's casket. 
AN OLD MAN with a brass-tipped cane.  Two GIRLS, look like sisters, holding each other up.  A MAN with a thick red beard.  A LITTLE BOY, about five, clutching a FLUTE tied with a pink ribbon... 
Will, looks away.  Then.  At the end of the line.  Something catches his eye. 
RANDY STETZ 
in tight jeans and a down vest.  In front of him stands a GIRL with white-blonde hair. 
From the torn pictures in Kay Connell's room. 
Will, straightens at the sight of her. 
Sees Randy surreptitiously caress her ass. 
EXT. CEMETERY - LATER 
The service is over.  People are heading back to their cars. Fred yanks off his tie.  Looks at Ellie. 
FRED We should go say hello to Mrs. Connell. 
He starts off.  Ellie, looks back at Will. 
WILL You go ahead.  I'll be there in a second. 
Ellie nods.  Catches up to Fred.  Will turns his attention back to RANDY AND THE GIRL.  Over at the far end of the cemetery.  Standing next to Randy's motorcycle. 
EXT. AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST - MINUTES LATER 
Randy gets on his bike, strapping his helmet on.  The girl's about to get on behind him. 
WILL (O.S.) Why don't I give her a ride? 
They look over.  WILL walking towards them.  The wind whipping his jacket.  His tie.  Randy makes a face. 
RANDY Thought I smelled something. 
WILL Good to see you, too, Randy. 
Will arrives at the bike.  The girl, TANYA FRANCKE, looks at him curiously.  Her long white-blonde hair, her skin almost translucent.  Something sexy about her.  Has the carnation stuck in the buttonhole of her jean jacket. 
TANYA Who're you? 
EXT. GRAVESITE - CONTINUOUS 
Fred shakes Mrs. Connell's hand.  Ellie waits.  Looks over and sees 
WILL standing with Tanya and Randy. 
Shifts the plant in her hands. 
Tanya squirming in her seat.  Not liking this any more. 
TANYA Move over! 
Will staring dead ahead.  Tensing his jaw.  The TRUCK... bearing down on them... 
Tanya reaches for the wheel...Will pushes her hands away... The TRUCK...a breath away... 
TANYA (cont'd) (screaming) Move over, you crazy fuck! 
EXT. CHEROKEE - COASTAL ROAD 
The truck and the Cherokee...just feet from each other...at the last moment...the Cherokee jerks out of the way... 
EXT. ICICLE FISHING CANNERY - DAY 
...SCREECHES to a stop near an old sign, Icicle Cannery. Gravel flying.  Will gets out.  Slams his door.  Rounds the car and opens Tanya's door.  She's screaming at him. 
TANYA You crazy son-of-a-bitch!  You could have killed us! 
Will reaches in and pulls her out of the car. 
TANYA (cont'd) Ow!  You're hurting me! 
Will pulls her up a steep hill of garbage and broken crates. Pushes her down the other side.  She stumbles. 
TANYA (cont'd) You want to tell me what the fuck this is all about? 
Will stands above her, on the hill.  His face set like stone. 
WILL You and Kay were like sisters? 
TANYA That's what I said. 
WILL Told each other everything. (heads down the hill) That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau? 
Tanya steps back. 
WILL (cont'd) Why her boyfriend's hand was clamped on your ass at her funeral? 
He grabs her by the arm.  Jerks it up.  She CRIES out.  Will leans in. 
WILL (cont'd) You like games, little girl?  Well how about this one - you're standing right where her naked body was found wrapped up in a garbage bag. 
Tanya's eyes grow wide.  She looks around her.  Disgusting, rotten.  A SEAGULL pecking at the body of a dead bird.  She tries to break away... 
TANYA No... 
WILL Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz? 
Tanya looks away. 
WILL (cont'd) Who gave her those dresses? 
She struggles more.  No good.  Will's grip is like a vice. 
WILL (cont'd) I need a name. 
TANYA I don't know. 
WILL You don't know. 
TANYA She wouldn't tell me! 
WILL But you were such good friends... 
Tanya, squirming.  Angry. 
TANYA It was like some big fucking secret! 
WILL What was? 
TANYA She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That he was going to take her! 
WILL Who? 
TANYA My arm! 
WILL Who? 
TANYA She used some stupid code name. 
WILL What was it? 
TANYA Brody...I don't know... (crying) ...Something Brody! 
Will straightens.  He's heard that name before. 
Suddenly Tanya jams her heel into his shoe.  He CRIES out. She breaks away from him.  Runs up the hill.  Turns.  Tears streaking her face.  Throws the carnation to the ground. 
TANYA (cont'd) You happy now, you fucking bastard? 
INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHTMUTE - DAY 
CLOSE ON a FINGER.  Running along a row of book spines. Brundt...Buckley...Buss...Buckham...Byrie... 
PULL BACK to reveal will in Nightmute's small bookstore. Still in his funeral clothes. 
In the "Mystery!" section.  Not finding what he wants.  Then, something catches his eye:  A BARGAIN BIN at the end of the aisle.  Will limps down to it.  Avoides eye-contact with a YOUNG WOMAN shelving "New Arrivals!" 
Reaches into the bin.  Rummages through some paperbacks. Then he finds it:  Otherwise Engaged by Walter Byrd. Underneath the title, he finds what he's looking for: Another J. Brody Mystery.  Flips to the inside of the cover. 
A BLURRY PICTURE of Walter Byrd.  Head turned to the side. Walter Byrd was born in Watson Lake, Canada.  He graduated... 
WALTER I figured we're partners on this one.  I mean, after what I saw... 
Will stops short.  Eyes burning.  It's all he can do not to throttle this weed. 
WILL Let's get one thing straight, Byrd.  We are partners on nothing. 
Walter looks at him.  Scratches his head. 
WALTER I research my novels.  I know the procedures.  You'd have cuffed me back at the ferry.  You'd have called for back- up, read me my rights, and gotten a search warrant for my apartment.  You're a well-respected detective.  There's no reason for you to be talking to me right now... 
He takes out a handkerchief.  Blows his nose. 
WALTER (cont'd) ...except that we could help each other. 
Will stares at him. 
WALTER (cont'd) So.  We're at an impasse. 
Will runs his hands through his hair.  Half-crazed.  Heart pounding.  Turns to watch... 
THE KIDS down the glacier.  Making angels in the snow.  Their GIGGLES carried along by the wind. 
Will, squeezes his eyes shut.  Trapped.  About to defy every instinct in his body. 
WILL (sotto) You're going to get a phone call. 
Walter steps up, tapping his hearing aid. 
WALTER I'm sorry? 
WILL I said you're going to get a phone call. 
WALTER (perks up) Oh? 
WILL Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books. 
WALTER Thought you might find that. 
WILL You're going to be brought in for questioning. 
Walter smiles.  Pleased. 
WALTER Down at the station? 
WILL (hisses) Yes down at the station. 
Walter rubs his hands together.  Thinking. 
WALTER Okay.  Okay.  Brought in for questioning. Good.  I can write this. 
JUST THEN the ferry blows its HORN.  Low and loud.  Walter looks down at it. 
WALTER (cont'd) Ferry's leaving. 
He starts down.  Will watches him pass, has no choice but to follow.  Walter, going over the details in his head. 
WALTER (cont'd) Something to divert... 
Snaps his fingers.  An idea. 
WALTER (cont'd) My gun.  You still have my gun, right? 
Will nods.  Walter smiles.  Spreads out his hands. 
WALTER (cont'd) Then that's the wild card.  Every detective story has a wild card. 
WILL What do you mean, "wild card?" 
TOURISTS.  Boarding the ferry. 
WALTER Next ferry's in forty-five minutes. 
Walter heads over to the ramp.  Will stops, grabbing his side.  A PANG through his ribs.  Excruciating.  Calls out to Walter. 
WILL What do you mean "wild card?" 
Walter looks back.  Waves. 
WALTER You'll know.  At the questioning. 
Gives his ticket to the TICKET TAKER.  Gets on.  Walks back to the stern.  Looks out at Will.  The HORN sounds again. 
Walter, at the rail.  Smiles.  The ferry's engine, churning up water.  Starting forward just as... 
Walter takes a MINI CASSETTE RECORDER from his pocket.  Holds it up for Will to see. 
Will, on shore, sees it.  A cold flash ripping through his body.  That motherfucker.  Bolts through some tourists towards the ramp but... 
A couple of GUYS are just pulling it in.  The Ticket Taker, grabs his arm. 
TICKET TAKER (to Will) Full up. 
Will, jerks his arm away.  Stares off at the ferry.  Walter Byrd and his tape recorder.  Receding into the distance. 
INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHTMUTE - DAY 
CLOSE ON a counter top.  Stuff thrown down.  Aspirin.  Band- aids.  Gauze.  Medical tape.  First aid cream.  Back pills. Sleeping pills.  Bottle of scotch. 
PULL BACK to reveal Will standing at the counter in the convenience store.  His entire body aching.  The CASHIER, throws him a look. 
WILL I have a cold. 
EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - MINUTES LATER 
A DARK FIGURE.  Appears ahead.  Big and hulking...CRASHING towards us... 
We raise our weapon...quick as a flash...as the FIGURE emerges... 
And in a split second... 
WE LOCK EYES WITH FIGURE's - his eyes, brown and gentle... 
CRACK!  We fire!  The FIGURE grips his gut, falls into the water. 
Heart POUNDING.  Adrenaline PUMPING.  We slosh towards the body.  Something...catching our eye... 
A 357 RUGER 
lying in the rocks.  Off to the side.  We grab it.  Turn back to the body... 
And stop cold. 
That's when it hits us.  That's when we realize... 
INT. WILL'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT 
Will bolts up.  White as a sheet. 
WILL I didn't know! 
His body, drenched in sweat.  His breathing, quick and ragged.  Caught up in the twisted sheets of his bed.  Looks across the room and sees 
HAP 
sitting in the corner.  Eating an apple with a penknife. 
HAP You sure about that, buddy? 
He smiles.  Sympathetic.  Looks over at the window just as... 
The BLANKET.  Drops to the floor. 
LIGHT floods the room. 
INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:02 A.M. 
With a GRUNT Will puts his back into it.  Shoving the heavy oak bureau towards the window.  Sweat beading his face. 
A...few...more...shoves.  And the bureau finally stands in front of the window.  WIll stands back to take a look.  Only covers half of it. 
WILL Fuck! 
INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:35 A.M. 
Red-faced, Will leans into the wooden armoire.  Shimmying it towards the window... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHT 
Ellie.  Sitting in her truck.  Parked behind the Pioneer Lodge.  Rubbbing her eyes.  Sleepy.  Looking up at 
WILL'S WINDOW 
concerned. 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:35 A.M. 
With one last heave, Will gets the armoire to the window. Light still shining through the cracks. 
INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:50 A.M. 
Will shoving magazines, blankets, sheets, pillows.  Anything. To fill the cracks.  To cover the light.  His eyes.  Like a crazy man's... 
SUDDENLY a knock on the door.  Will turns. 
RACHEL (O.S.) Detective Dormer? 
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Rachel standing out in the hallway.  Will opens the door. 
RACHEL (startled by his appearance) Will...I... 
WILL What is it? 
RACHEL There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise. (beat) Says he can't sleep. 
Will gives a half-smile.  Fucking irony.  Heads back into... 
INT. WILL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
...his room.  Rachel follows.  Looks around at the mess. 
RACHEL Are you alright? 
Will grabs up a sweater. 
WILL I'm fine. 
He heads back over to the window.  Rachel now notices all the stuff piled up.  Softens her voice. 
RACHEL Did something happen? 
Will.  Cramming the sweater into a crack. 
ELLIE When did you first meet her? 
Fred shoots Ellie a look.  She closes her mouth. 
WALTER A year ago.  At one of my signings. 
Ellie hands Fred the hardback of Otherwise Engaged.  He holds it up.  Opened to the signature. 
FRED Where you signed this? 
WALTER That's right. 
FRED What happened at that signing? 
WALTER She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books. 
FRED Did she? 
WALTER Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week... 
Will, from over by the window.  Interrupts. 
WILL What was the nature of your relationship? 
Walter looks over.  Wide-eyed. 
WALTER What do you mean, Detective Dormer? 
Will turns.  Accusatory. 
WILL She was an attractive girl.  Did you have sex with her? 
Walter blinks. 
WALTER She was only seventeen. 
WILL But she was an attractive girl. 
WALTER I suppose. 
WILL Did you have sex with her? 
Fred shoots Will a look.  Ellie, watching him. 
WALTER No. 
WILL But you wanted to. 
WALTER I was a mentor to her. 
Will heads over to Walter's chair.  Fists clenched in his pockets. 
WILL You gave her gifts. 
WALTER Yes. 
WILL Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace. 
WALTER Yes. 
WILL Doesn't sound like a mentor to me. 
WALTER I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have. 
He turns to Fred and Ellie. 
WALTER (cont'd) Her family lives on Mr. Connell's disability.  It isn't much. 
Fred stops Will with a look.  Had enough. 
FRED We understand, Mr. Byrd. (to Will) You want to sit down, Detective? 
Tense BEAT.  Will stares at Walter.  Revulsion.  Heads back over to the window. 
WALTER She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to. 
FRED How do you mean? 
WALTER That boyfriend.  Randy. 
Fred, sits up. 
FRED Randy Stetz? 
WALTER That's right. 
WILL What about him? 
WALTER He.  Well, he... 
Walter hesitates.  Takes a sip of coffee. 
WALTER (cont'd) I don't want to talk out of school.  Kay told me things in the strictest of confidence.  As a friend. 
FRED Mr. Byrd.  Anything you can tell us could help out with this case. 
Walter furrows his brow.  Taps his hearing aid. 
WALTER Well.  He hit her. 
Ellie's eyes widen.  Fred glances at Will.  But Will's too busy watching this little man weave his web. 
FRED Are you sure about that? 
FRED AND A UNIFORMED COP struggle to drag Randy through the doorway.  Randy writhes, kicks, tugs.  Screams. 
RANDY (cont'd) That ain't mine! 
Fred grabs Randy's shoulder. 
FRED C'mon, Randy. 
Randy squirms.  Turns.  Looks right into Will's eyes.  Gone is the bluster.  Gone is the attitude.  Randy Stetz, lost kid.  Tears streaming down his face. 
RANDY I swear to God.  I didn't kill her.  I swear to God... 
EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT - DAY 
Will stands outside the garage apartment.  Wind whipping his coat.  Watches as a Nightmute PD SQUAD CAR pulls off with Randy Stetz in the back. 
Fred sees him, heads over. 
FRED You look like shit, cowboy. 
Will shifts his eyes to him. 
WILL That's an understatement. 
Fred half-smiles.  Watches the receding squad car. 
FRED Looks like we can wrap this one up. 
Will barely nods.  Fred pulls his baseball cap on. 
FRED (cont'd) We're getting together for a couple of beers later on.  Might not be the Seattle thing to do.  But you're welcome to come. 
Fred puts out his hand to shake.  Truce.  Will looks at him. Takes it. 
INT. SHANTY BAR - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON a tray of dark beer.  Five glasses, foam sloshing. 
FARRELL (O.S.) I can't believe it.  Randy Stetz. 
PULL BACK to reveal Farrell, Rich, Francis, and Will sitting at a small, round table.  Fred's passing out the beers.  Dive bar.  MUSIC blaring.  3 a.m. Happy Hour! banner on the wall. Place packed with rough-looking FISHERMEN. 
Rich takes a glass from Fred. 
RICH What do you mean, you can't believe it? 
FRANCIS He was an asshole. 
FARRELL That doesn't mean anything. 
Fred sits.  Takes a sip of his beer.  To Farrell. 
FRED Didn't you grow up with him? 
Farrell shifts in his seat. 
FARRELL Our dads were on the same boat. (to Will) We used to wait for them together. 
Will nods.  Jostled by the crowd.  Reaches for his beer. 
FRANCIS He used to pick fights at the gas station. 
RICH And remember when he did all those donut holes that one summer? 
He and Francis GUFFAW. 
FRED Just a bad seed. 
Farrell looks over at Will. 
FARRELL How do you like our beer? 
Will slams down his empty glass.  Squeezes his eyes open and shut.  Loud music.  Cigarette smoke. 
WILL I like it fine. 
Fred pats Will's shoulder. 
FRED What Detective Dormer needs is a little shut-eye. 
RICH The white nights been hard on you? 
WILL They haven't been easy. 
Francis grabs a handful of peanuts. 
FRANCIS They don't have titanium shades over at the Pioneer. 
RICH Well no wonder. 
FRANCIS You lose all sense of time. 
FARRELL Better than Fred's home town. 
Will turns to Fred.  Wiping the foam from his moustache. 
FRED My people are from Barrow.  Way up north. 
RICH In the winter there's no sunlight for five straight months. 
FRED Like being swallowed up in a black hole. 
JUST THEN. 
WILL approaches the monument.  Sonics sweatshirt, wrinkled coat.  Face drawn and haggard.  Angry. 
WALTER (smiles) Hi, Will... 
Will enters the monument. 
WILL What the hell are you doing calling me at the station? 
A gust of wind WHORLS through the monument. 
WALTER I figured we should touch base.  Compare notes.  I think it went well.  What did you think? 
Will's eyes pierce into him. 
WILL Randy Stetz is in jail. 
WALTER Told you I could write an ending. 
WILL Congratulations. 
Will holds out his hand. 
WILL (cont'd) The tape. 
Walter looks at the open hand.  Hugs his jacket to him. 
WALTER I thought maybe we could talk some more. 
WILL There's nothing more to talk about. 
WALTER But we work so well together... 
Will breaks.  Rushes Walter.  Slams him against one of the concrete pilasters. 
WILL We do nothing well together. (SLAMS him again) Nothing!  You understand me? 
Another wave CRASHES.  Sprays them.  Walter looks up into Will's bloodshot eyes. 
WALTER You run on two settings, Will.  I've noticed that... 
Will tightens his grip. 
WALTER (cont'd) You jump from calm to rage in the blink of an eye.  That's okay.  I do that too. 
He holds up the tape.  Will grabs it, shoves Walter to the side.  Yanks the tape out of the cassette.  Steps back and HURLS it into the sea.  Waves engulf it hungrily. 
Walter watches him. 
WALTER (cont'd) You're not sleeping, are you? 
WILL What the hell do you know? 
WALTER Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me. 
PAUSE. 
WALTER (cont'd) Does Detective Eckhart come to you? 
Will curls his fists. 
WALTER (cont'd) Does he ask you why you shot him? 
Whips around... 
WILL I told you that was an accident! 
WALTER Then so was mine... 
WILL Don't you pull that shit with me. 
WALTER I didn't want to kill her, Will. 
Steps closer to him.  Beseeching. 
WALTER (cont'd) When she called me that night from the party, she'd had a fight with Randy. Wanted to talk.  I told her to meet me at our special place.  The cabin at the beach... 
A couple RAVENS alight nearby.  Flapping their wings. SCREECHING into the wind. 
WALTER (cont'd) ...When she came she was barefoot.  And there was liquor on her breath.  I only wanted to comfort her.  To touch her. She could have at least let me do that. Her skin...it was like everything I'd ever written about. 
A dark shadow crosses his face.  Holds on to the coiled rope of the statue.  Will hisses. 
WILL Couldn't get it up, Walter? 
WALTER It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all. 
Walter.  Squeezing the bronze rope. 
WALTER (cont'd) From calm to rage in the blink of an eye. 
Locks eyes with Will.  Conspiratorial. 
WALTER (cont'd) Remember? 
WILL'S HAND shoots out.  Clamps around Walter's neck. 
WILL Like this? 
Walter's face, starts turning red. 
WALTER Yes.  Like that. 
WILL This an accident, Walter? 
She and Will lock eyes.  Hold for a beat. 
He knows exactly what she was trying to do. 
INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - NIGHTMUTE - DAY 
Will, driving down Nightmute's main street.  He takes a left. Goes up a hill.  Glances out the window.  Passing by 
THE CEMETERY.  A cluster of headstones.  Something catches his eye.  He stops the car. 
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHTMUTE - DAY 
Will, walking up to the wrought-iron gate surrounding the cemetery.  Stops.  Puts his hands up to the bars. 
KAY CONNELL'S GRAVE 
on the other side.  Newly dug.  A mound of dirt.  Flowers, scattered by the wind.  Daughter and Friend...1982-1999. 
Will.  Grips the bars.  As if he's seeing it for the first time.  Really seeing it. 
Closes his eyes. 
What have I done? 
INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - EVENING 
Will's REFLECTION in the mirror.  He's showered.  Hair's combed.  Put on a clean suit.  Steps back.  Smooths down his lapels.  Just right. 
Turns to face the room.  Bed's made, mess cleaned up.  He heads over to the bureau, pulls out his Smith 39/13.  Lays it on the bed. 
Unclips his badge from his belt.  Lays it on the bed.  Takes something from the bedside table.  The BULLET found in Hap Eckhart.  Lays it on the bed. 
All neat.  All ordered. 
Reaches under the mattress.  Pulls out the PHOTOGRAPH of a blurry Walter Byrd standing in front of a house.  A radio tower in the background.  The call numbers: WKOZ. 
Will studies it.  Tears it in half. 
INT. BACK ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - EVENING 
Rachel in the back room behind reception.  A pullman's kitchen, a desk, an old recliner.  Pouring some milk into a bowl for a CAT.  A stray. 
Will walks in.  Rachel turns, smiles. 
RACHEL I found a new friend. 
Will walks up to her.  Puts his arms around her.  Holds her, smells her, kisses her neck.  Pulls away.  Looks into her eyes. 
RACHEL (cont'd) Will.  What is it? 
He doesn't answer.  The cat, rubs against his leg.  PURRING. 
INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - EVENING 
Will driving along a forest road.  Eyes dead ahead.  A map on the passenger seat.  By the fold, Kgun Lake circled in pencil. 
INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - CONTINUOUS 
Ellie working at her desk.  Looks up at the clock: 6:00. Gets up, grabs her down vest.  Heads for the door.  Farrell sticks the tip of his crutch in her path.  She stumbles. 
ELLIE Very funny, Farrell... 
EXT. ROAD TO KGUN LAKE - EVENING 
AERIAL VIEW of the silver Jeep Cherokee.  The only car on the road.  The sky, white-grey.  The trees, a blanket of green. The Cherokee heads around a hairpin curve.

Rachel at reception.  Reading the paper.  Ellie walks in. 
ELLIE Hi, Rachel. 
INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - ROAD TO KGUN LAKE - EVENING

IN THE DISTANCE, a radio tower.  WKOZ. 
INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE WILL'S ROOM - EVENING 
Rachel and Ellie, standing outside Will's room.  Ellie knocks again. 
RACHEL I would have seen if he came back. 
INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - EVENING 
The CLICK of a key and the door opens.  Ellie strides in. 
ELLIE Detective Dormer? 
She stops.  Rachel behind her.  Taking in the strange feeling in the room.  Walks over to the bed.  Eyes riveted on the 39/13.  On the bullet.  Rachel, behind her. 
RACHEL What is all this? 
Ellie, her mind races.  Notices TORN PHOTOGRAPH PIECES in the trash can.  Reaches in and pulls some out.  A puzzle. 
INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - LAKE KGUN 
Will stops the car at the end of a narrow dirt driveway. Looming before him... 
A HOUSE right on the lake.  Tall, wooden, in disrepair. Chipping yellow paint.  A ghost of what it once was.  The house from the photograph. 
INT. STUDY - HOUSE 
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Will, on his feet, trying to focus.  His suit, soaked with blood.  Looking for his gun.  Spots it, in the corner... 
INT. LIBRARY 
Walter jerks open another drawer.  A STACK OF BOOKS teeter on the top of the cabinet.  He finds what he needs.  SHELLS. Grabs a handful... 
THE BOOKS tumble down on top of him.  He CRIES out, covering his head...touches his ear, panics - hearing aid's gone! Looks up.  Will, coming down the hall... 
INT. HALLWAY 
Will hobbles into the library.  Sweeps the room with this gun. No Walter. 
Steps on something, crushing it.  Looks down.  Walter's hearing aid.  Kicks it aside. 
INT. FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS 
Ellie.  In the front hall.  Following procedure.  Right hand gripping the gun.  Left supporting the butt. 
Blinks away sweat.  Facing three doorways. 
INT. DINING ROOM 
Will limps into the dining room.  Furniture stacked high. Eyes, darting.  Gun, covering.  Trying to stay conscious... 
BANG!  The screen door. 
INT. FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS 
Ellie.  Gun swinging.  Doorway one.  Doorway two.  Doorway three...SUDDENLY 
A FIGURE 
runs past number one.  Big.  Shadowy.  The flash of a GUN. She wheels toward it.  Finger on the trigger... 
SLO-MO...The FIGURE, passing.  Her heart, POUNDING.  Her finger...squeezing... 
Will Dormer or Walter Byrd? 
At the last second, she jerks the gun away.  The figure disappears.  She swallows.  Gripping the gun.  Follows. 
EXT. BACK YARD - SUMMER HOUSE 
The sky, heavy with clouds.  The air, foreboding.  Will steals out the screen door.  Gun cocked.  Eyes scanning. Wind, bending the weeds, the trees. 
BAM! a shot.  Out of nowhere.  Rips into his thigh.  Will CRIES out.  BAM! a second shot.  Whizzes past him... 
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
...CRACK! the shot bites into the window frame.  Wings Ellie halfway across the room.  She drops to the floor.  Clutching her shoulder.  Flesh wound. 
ELLIE Shit! 
Pulls herself over to a SIDEBOARD for cover.  Shrinks behind it.  Notices 
A PLASTIC BAG sticking out from one of the drawers.  Nudges it open.  A flowered dress, some panty-hose, strands of long dark hair... 
EXT. BACK YARD - SUMMER HOUSE 
Will.  On the ground.  Gripping his leg.  Looking wildly around.  No sign of Walter.  Then.  He sees it. 
Lucy and Desi.  Down by the boathouse. 
INT. BOATHOUSE 
The boathouse.  Old, rotted wood.  Crumbling beams. 
Walter stands at a window.  Re-loading his shotgun.  He fumbles, drops a shell.  It rolls towards a crack in the floor.  Falls into the LAKE WATER below. 
CLICK!  Walter levels the shotgun out the window. 
WALTER'S POV - the long, undulating WEEDS outside. 
EXT. WEEDS 
Will.  Pulling himself through the weeds.  Losing blood fast. Dragging his body.  Approaches the side of the BOATHOUSE. 
WALTER'S GUN BARREL, sticking out. 
Will ducks his head.  Winces in pain.  Breathing, becoming ragged.  Rounds to the other side.  Hoists himself up to another WINDOW.  Cautiously looks in... 
WALTER at the far window. 
Will jerks back.  Steps on the dock.  A plank CREAKS.  Shit. Peers back through the window. 
WALTER.  Still looking out.  Didn't hear a thing. 
Will remembers.  Walter doesn't have his hearing aid.  He's deaf on that side. 
INT. BOATHOUSE 
Walter, looking out the window. 
OVER HIS SHOULDER - we see Will climbing in through the window.  Smearing blood along the sill, favoring his leg. Stands straight.  Levels his gun at Walter's back. 
WILL (softly) Walter? 
Nothing.  Walter continues staring out the window.  Will raises his voice. 
WILL (cont'd) Walter! 
Walter jumps, whips around.  Comes face to face with the barrel of Will Dormer's gun.  Surprised.  Absently touches his deaf ear.

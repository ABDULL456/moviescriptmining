PITCHER STEP IT UP NOW! (back the Batter) Ready for my knuckle-curve? 
The Batter just stays focused as the Pitcher tosses a high- lob. Batter smacks the ball a mile high, deep to left. The teammates of the plump-pink Boy on third: 
TEAMMATES TAG UP! WAIT `TIL SHE CATCHES IT- 
PITCHER (spins, points up at the ball) -COMIN' HOME! 
A 14 year-old Indian girl sprints underneath the fly-ball: sets up, catches it, juggles it, drops it. 
We pick up different families on the grass nearby: A young WOMAN helps her five year old DAUGHTER untangle a yo-yo. A black COUPLE doing a crossword puzzle together, the wife's head on her husband's lap.

13   EXT. UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT                          13 
The muted reaction to the dropped ball. The whole Family, save the youngest Grandson, intently focused on two Officers walking up to that Police Land Cruiser parked in the middle of the road, well inside the compound: no blinks now. 
The youngest still enthralled by the softball game, the cheers, the running, the shorts and t-shirts. We see his Grandfather's left hand stop rubbing the Boy's head, and move to the Boy's temple, placed like a blinder so he can't see what's about to happen. In Arabic: 
GRANDFATHER Don't stop watching the game. 
14   EXT. INSIDE THE COMPOUND WALLS - NEXT MOMENT                 14 
Noises from the softball game close again. Track these two Officers on foot walking toward the Police Land Cruiser ala shift change: nonchalant but quick. 
15   INT. POLICE LAND CRUISER - SAME MOMENT                       15 
The Driver eyeing the two approaching Officers: something off about them. Uniforms wrinkled, one with a full beard. Driver turns to his Partner, in Arabic: 
DRIVER You have a copy of the duty rost- 
-POP-POP-POP before the Driver finishes. The Officers on foot rapid-firing 9MM pistols. The Driver and Passenger hit multiple times instantly, crumble lifeless in their seats before anyone has time to process the sounds, link them to an attack. The two firing `Officers' move low-fast like professionals: rip the fresh bodies from the Cruiser, jump in. The new Passenger rips an AR-15 rifle off the center console. The new Driver lays rubber into the Compound. 
16   EXT. UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT                          16 
The youngest Grandson wide-eyed, startled, watches as every member of the Security Details in and around the Compound go prairie dog: search with necks extended, eyes wide -- what the fuck was that? The Boy tries to turn his head away from the game to look for himself: Grandfather just pushes his head back to the game, voice harder now, in Arabic: 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   9. 
GRANDFATHER (O.C.) I said keep watching the game. 
17   EXT. COMPOUND MAIN ENTRANCE - SAME MOMENT                     17 
Haytham instantly sprints toward another nearby Police Land Cruiser as most everyone else ducks. In Arabic: 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM LOCK DOWN! 
Then points at the Officer in the Driver's seat: 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM (CONT'D) MOVE! 
18   EXT. COMPOUND SOFTBALL DIAMOND - SAME MOMENT                  18 
Game forgotten. Parents up, screaming for loved ones, moving fast toward the parking lot. The Middle-Eastern Officer that has been watching the game hustles onto the field, next to the Pitcher, waves people toward him. Gathering but sporadic gun-fire in very near distance. 
WATCHING OFFICER (accented English) COME TO ME! FOLLOW ME! 
People immediately flocking around the authority figure. 
CUT TO: 
The 14 year-old Indian Girl running in, more puzzled than scared: why is that Cop wearing a jacket in this heat? 
BACK TO: 
The Officer rips a yellow gun-shape from his jacket pocket. The Pitcher sees it, instinctively tries to rip it away from him. Gets a handful of collar, pulls as violently as he can, shreds the front of the Officer's coat: a white linen vest with a bulge in-front underneath the jacket... 
19   EXT. UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT                           19 
The youngest grandson's wide-eyed face. Then we see the Grandfather's right-hand slide down the other side of his youngest Grandson's face, coming to rest on his other temple: making sure he's still watching the Softball diamond now. The Grandfather's right hand: missing an index and middle finger. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   10. 
20   EXT. COMPOUND SOFTBALL DIAMOND - SAME MOMENT                 20 
Panic. The Officer swings the yellow gun-shape, what we now realize is an electric drill crudely modified into something else, bashes the Pitcher's face with it. Those that had gathered have turned, are sprint-stumbling away... 
The Officer closes his eyes, depresses the drill trigger, vanishes before we comprehend the massive release of blue- black chaos, expanding in an ever-wider sphere. Immediate surroundings dissolve: players, parents, stands, cars, the light standards surrounding the field and parking lot. 
21   EXT. CINDER-BLOCK CONCESSION STAND - SAME MOMENT             21 
Located behind straight-a-way center field, at the nexus of four fields. We see it from profile as shock-wave and shrapnel blast the structure: another Officer hiding behind it staggers out now, sprawls ugly: balance fucked from a blown inner-ear. He also wears a jacket, and holds a modified yellow plastic power drill. Moves uneasy toward screams in the nearby parking lot. 
22   EXT. SOFTBALL DIAMOND PARKING LOT - NEXT MOMENT              22 
The off-balance Officer stops over a 30 year-old African- American woman pinned under a Toyota. She hyperventilates, her bare leg and open-toed sandal kick at air. The Officer's breathing calms: the sight of exposed skin as divine reassurance. CLOSE-UP: the vented rear of the drill as the 14.4 volt motor sparks blue. A second blue-black explosion that shreds the parking lot as cars smash into one another desperate to escape. 
23   EXT. ADJACENT STREET - NEXT MOMENT                           23 
Panicked women walking dogs. Frozen. A Police Land Cruiser with bullet-scarred windows roars around the corner. Stops near the women. They smile: cavalry to the rescue. Then a man with leans out the window with an AR-15: point-blank staccato. Tracers exit bodies, drill asphalt. The Land Cruiser rolls, spraying passing homes indiscriminate... 
24   INT. JACKED LAND CRUISER - NEXT MOMENT                       24 
Tearing through the streets, Passenger firing at all signs of life. Sits back for a lightning-quick re-load. Leans back out -- before he can begin firing again- 
Sykes just hard-eyes Leavitt.

KINGDOM 8/18/06   22. 
32   INT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - UNKNOWN TIME              32 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI, Saudi Police, 45 years-old, mustache as thick as Sykes'. A firecracker-loud crack makes him flinch. He stands in the back of the room, not participating in the interrogation. Just observing. Clearly not happy about what he's observing. 
His POV: The Officer from the second Land Cruiser that rammed the fake and killed those inside, Sergeant Haytham. slab- cuffed and being worked over hard buy a couple of thick- fisted SAUDIS.. Silent tears roll off his cheek, left ear split ghastly. A MAN standing far right of him beats him: the firecracker sound again. 
Al-Ghazi looks away, biting his tongue. Obviously wants this over. 
In-charge of the interrogation: GENERAL ABDUL MALIK. He doesn't appear sadistic, but very determined to get the truth from Sergeant Haytham by any means necessary. Those distinctions blur easily. Malik gives a `hold-up' signal. The following exchange in Arabic: 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK No falsehoods, Sergeant Haytham. What was your involvement? 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM Killing those I saw responsible. 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK So none could be questioned? 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM (puzzled, angry) I don't understand. 
A nod from General Malik: another vicious crack. 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK You were born and raised in Suweidi- 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM -that is not a crime- 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK -it should be. 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM It's not. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   23. 
GENERAL ABDUL MALIK Do you know Abu Hamza? 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM I do not. 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK Your brother was killed fighting the Americans. True or false? 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM I am not my brother. 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK Your brother-- 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM I am NOT my brother! 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK TRUE or- 
Al-Ghazi interrupts. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI He has answered the question. 
Malik shoots Al-Ghazi a unequivocal SHUT THE FUCK UP hard eye. Then back on Haytham. 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK We found six more uniforms than you were assigned in your possession -- that is a crime: especially when you consider the Attackers wore our Uniform... 
Another nod, another crack. Al-Ghazi, flinching, becomes more alert. 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM Uniforms? 
General Malik in Haytham's face: 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK Truth! 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM I sweat. I'll say it again because it is true. I need more uniforms because I must change during shifts...look at my shirts. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06     24. 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK I am not interested in your sweat. 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM -then look at my jackets. Please. Permanent stains...no matter how many times they're cleaned... 
Colonel Al-Ghazi grimacing now, leaves the room. 
33   INT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD - STORAGE - NEXT MOMENT            33 
We follow. Al-Ghazi hustling into an evidence storage room. Searching. Finds a Locker labelled `Haytham.' Opens it. Pulls out several shirts still in the plastic dry-cleaning sheaths: yellowed, permanent stains on the armpits of each. 
34   INT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - INTERROGATION ROOM        34 
Al-Ghazi walks back into the room with the shirts, lays them down on the table in front of the General -- all business. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI He's telling the truth. 
The only sound for a long, unsettled moment: Sergeant Haytham's labored breathing. Malik looks at the shirts, then Al-Ghazi, hesitates, steps away. 
GENERAL ADBUL-MALIK You were injured when you used your vehicle to protect your country. Do you understand? 
Al-Ghazi moves in, begins uncuffing Haytham's bloody-raw wrists, hard-eyeing Malik the whole time. These men clearly don't like each other. 
35   EXT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - LATER                     35 
Al-Ghazi and Haytham sit alone. Al-Ghazi smokes. Haytham looks down at his feet. 
ELLIS LEACH I met with Prince Thamer at the Saudi embassy fifteen minutes after I heard this morning's news. After speaking with Thamer, I advised we withhold additional US personnel because a big part of the religious justification for these bombs is the presence of current US personnel. More boots on Saudi soil make an already combustible situation more so. I know that's not the answer you want, but... 
Motions to Maricella: the floor is yours. 
MARICELLA CANAVESIO My two cents: The Saudis haven't asked for FBI help. Sounds like they've done just the opposite. If we force the issue, that could further anger an utterly important ally that shares a 1000-mile long border with Iraq. 
GIDEON YOUNG (to Grace and Fleury) It's all rock-solid logic. 
DIRECTOR GRACE (beat) We would just like to be on record as saying we think we should go ASAP- 
GIDEON YOUNG That's not going to happen 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   29. 
Young stands: we're done. Fleury's look: that's it? Young's already collecting his briefcase, jacket- 
GIDEON YOUNG (CONT'D) (mock sincerity to the room:) -so as we present this to the public, let's - as best we can - try to view this through an FBI Agent's eyes. (beat...To Grace:) And please let me know if there's anything else we can do for you. 
Meeting seems over. Not quite. Fleury can't keep his mouth shut. 
RONALD FLEURY Sir, how would you imagine it looks viewed through an FBI agents eyes? 
GIDEON YOUNG Pardon me? 
RONALD FLEURY I'm interested in how you think this situation is viewed through our eyes. 
Young, eyes on a Republican-gold Rolex, instantly perturbed the meeting isn't ending. 
GIDEON YOUNG It's some variation on vengeance... When one of your own is killed, Agents lose their analytical powers - kind of a greatest strength, greatest weakness thing... 
RONALD FLEURY If I wanted vengeance, I'd have whispered `Rex Burr' into Ellis's ear right when we walked in. (beat) 
Eyes migrate to Fleury -- 
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) This isn't Terrorism, ma'am. It's just Serial Murder. 
MARICELLA CANAVESIO What's the distinction? 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   30. 
RONALD FLEURY To call this massacre an act of terrorism... that implies a specific political agenda. To me, these killings are so futile and unbalanced that they feel utterly sociopathic- more like Charles Manson than Osama Bin Laden... 
Fleury looks to Mayes. She clears her throat. Delivers the following with utter precision. 
JANET MAYES (beat, fuck it: Go) Al Qaeda lost the first phase of this war, so a new, zero-sum phase has begun: if you won't join us, we'll let loose the truly talented Murderers... Abu Hamza. He will kill so many of you that the resulting humiliation of the Saudi Royal Family will cause an exodus, a rebellion, both. Because the Royal Family simply cannot protect you or yours any longer. 
Fleury studies Janet with solid respect. He gives Janet a subtle nod: "Nice work." 
RONALD FLEURY When she says talented, she's not talking about the walking-bombs who can sneak past any and all security, nor the hi-jackers tough enough to take an airliner. We're talking about the Man who teaches them how... 
JANET MAYES --the operational commander who organizes, trains, plans, encourages. That is who we're fighting. 
RONALD FLEURY If we don't get inside Saudi Arabia within 36 hours, there is no chance we catch the killer responsible for Al-Rahmah. None. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   31. 
ELLIS LEACH Okay. I believe it all. So doesn't your team in that country represent the kind of target one of these `Masters' would die for? Trade ten of their own for one of you? 
RONALD FLEURY To not engage these criminals out of fear for our personal safety is just another way of saying `uncle.' 
Fleury takes another deep breath. 
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) I'll say it another way: Evidence starts to go cold after twenty four hours. If we can't get in now, we will not find the man or men responsible for this crime. We couldn't do it at Khobar; we couldn't do it in Yemen; we have barely scratched the surface in Iraq. And we are on verge of not doing it here. They are getting stronger, we are getting weaker. I just lost a very good friend and I would very much like to go and do my job. 
Beat. 
GIDEON YOUNG (chuckle) That was spirited... let's all thank God Special Agent Fleury doesn't make policy decisions. He'd turn the FBI into Patton's Third Army. 
Young stands. Fleury contemplates career-ending violence. 
38   EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY                                  38 
Janet, Fleury and Grace walking the rows of seven-foot bronze soldiers. Street-cart hotdogs from foil wrappers. 
DIRECTOR GRACE (to Fleury) I see the look in your eyes. That look is trouble: old school, play ground shit, vengeance... 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   32. 
RONALD FLEURY It's not vengeance. 
DIRECTOR GRACE It ain't justice. It's stronger. We've all been there. I have. Vengeance is always dirty, Ronnie. 
RONALD FLEURY I just can't sit this out. I can't watch this not get dealt with. Not again. (a beat...) Know what my high school football coach used to say to me? 
DIRECTOR GRACE What? 
RONALD FLEURY "HIT SOMETHING." All night long, Coach Bailey would scream "HIT SOMETHING." Every play. 
DIRECTOR GRACE That's good coaching. 
RONALD FLEURY I'm fixing to go hit something, boss. You with me? 
DIRECTOR GRACE How you gonna do it? 
RONALD FLEURY The Saudis covet good PR as much as their Oil: 15 of 19 hijackers on 9- 11 means most Americans will never stop asking if that Saudi Oil is worth it. It's all about press. 
41   INT. DIPLOMATIC SUBURBAN - MOMENTS LATER                   41 
A big bodyguard sits up front. Fleury sits in back, aims the AC vents his way. Prince Thamer sits next to him. Bright lights from the trail suburban illuminate the interior. 
Prince Thamer looks more than a bit baffled. 
RONALD FLEURY Too many people we both know were at the bar. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Highness. 
PRINCE THAMER I had an interesting conversation with a reporter from the Post. 
RONALD FLEURY She can be a bit of an exaggerator... I'm sure things were somewhat over-stated. I see myself as friend of Saudi Arabia. I just need a little cooperation, that's all. 
PRINCE THAMER What kind of cooperation?? 
RONALD FLEURY Full cooperation: my Team cleared to land at Prince Sultan Air Base. Tomorrow. We want to help in a very muscular way, quickly. 
PRINCE THAMER Next month would be as soon as... 
Fleury takes a beat. 
RONALD FLEURY This goes one of two ways. First: The FBI with the White House go on the kind of aggressive PR "Saudi Royal Family Decaying Monarchy" bender that just can't help but hurt. Really hurt. And I don't care how many Chinese are lined up to buy the oil. You know it's gonna hurt. 
PRINCE THAMER My family is not decaying- 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   37. 
RONALD FLEURY And then we bring the hammer down hard as hell: Bust Al Haramain - we got direct links from Riyadh - two wives donating ten million to three Arab-American cultural centers in Boston. Then what gets kind of not- funny is how some of that cash found its way to Jakarta and some Mosques that have these training camps built right next to them. It's kinda funny... you got little kids playing over here, and some not so little kids playing with guns over here. That's kinda odd. 
PRINCE THAMER You have no proof of this. 
RONALD FLEURY We're getting there, Sir. And I haven't even brought up the two girls still missing out of Houston. This is big. It is real. And I know you only care so much about public American opinion, Sir. But the story will be covered... Big... 
Thamer is clearly rattled. Fleury is starting to crack this man. 
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) And this ain't the Metro section. It's above the fold, just below the date. Words like these get syndicated to papers like the Omaha World-Herald, The Terrell Tribune -- You ever been to Terrell, Texas? 
PRINCE THAMER What is your point? 
Fleury looks back to him. 
RONALD FLEURY Last I heard, 112 people lost their lives in your country. One of them was a good friend of mine. I want in and I want in immediately. 
That's a rock solid answer. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   38. 
PRINCE THAMER Define "immediately." 
RONALD FLEURY Right now immediately. 
Fleury looks back at the Ambassador. A stare down. 
FLEURY If your phone doesn't work international, you can borrow mine. 
Prince Thamer slowly reaches for his phone as Fleury opens his door. 
FLEURY (CONT'D) I'll just be right out here. 
42   EXT. DIPLOMATIC SUBURBAN - MOMENTS LATER                     42 
Fleury waiting. Intense. 
The window rolls down, Thamer looking up at Fleury. 
The following is fast, tight negotiating: 
PRINCE THAMER (trying to maintain cool) We cannot allow 100 agents- 
RONALD FLEURY -4. With a 25-man security detail- 
PRINCE THAMER -even 25 more armed Americans could spark rebellion- 
RONALD FLEURY That's too bad. 
PRINCE THAMER Saudi Security. That's non negotiable. You cannot bring guns into the Kingdom. 
RONALD FLEURY Men in Saudi Police uniforms are why we're talking now. 
PRINCE THAMER They would be hand picked. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   39. 
RONALD FLEURY Whose hands? 
PRINCE THAMER Mine. 
Fleury blinks. 
PRINCE THAMER (CONT'D) Trust me...that's the only hope of this happening. 
FLEURY If anything happens to me or my team... It's on you. Understood? 
PRINCE THAMER Cool it with the John Wayne, Mr. Fleury. 
Fleury just stares. 
LEAVITT Actually, I didn't volunteer. 
FLEURY Thanks anyway. 
LEAVITT We're going to Riyadh? 
FLEURY Yup. 
SYKES State department said yes? 
FLEURY Nope. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   43. 
LEAVITT White House said yes? 
FLEURY Nope. 
LEAVITT Anybody said yes? 
FLEURY Not really. 
LEAVITT Are we bringing security? 
FLEURY Nope. 
Fleury walks onto the plane. Leaving the three on the tarmac. 
LEAVITT This is going to suck so bad. 
And the three follow Fleury onto the massive plane.

Janet and Leavitt play Scrabble. Sykes sits nearby. Fleury sits up front, wide awake. 
ADAM LEAVITT What can four people do in five days? Really? 
GRANT SYKES Aren't you the one who demanded to go this morning? 
ADAM LEAVITT I meant the FBI. I didn't mean "me." 
Small smile from Leavitt. The Scrabble continues... 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   44. 
ADAM LEAVITT (CONT'D) (to Janet) What's it like on the ground? 
GRANT SYKES Mars. 
JANET MAYES I'll be looked at with what I can only describe as disdain, pretty much the entire time we're on the ground... kind of like South Virginia. 
GRANT SYKES Go easy on my kin. 
JANET MAYES It's a very confused culture. Extremely religious. Had nothing; wanted nothing. Sixty years ago, they hit oil. Simple religious men become trillionaires... a schizophrenic nation is born. The royal family, who we back, and everyone else. 
Intercut with the Scrabble.

Three-Suburban convoy turns up a driveway, waved past a guard post bristling with automatic weapons and into the circular drive of a massive, walled palace. Impersonal wealth. Two dozen SANG troops on security detail. Two Humvees equipped with anti-aircraft missiles parked 100 yards apart. 
Colonel Al-Ghazi out of the middle Suburban. Frisked by SANG, rough: no love lost.

Al-Ghazi is passed to a silent, boundless staff holding serving platters jammed with cups of mint tea. A mammoth foyer. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   45. 
PRINCE SA'AD BIN KHALED (Saudi Interior Ministry) steps out from a 20-foot high doorway: nebbish, thin, bloodshot eyes magnified by thick glasses. His hand over his stomach: Napoleon's ulcers. A quick wave to Al-Ghazi. 
56   INT. PRINCE'S PRIVATE OFFICE - NEXT MOMENT                    56 
10' X 20' gold/glass desk over a 50' X 50' rug in a 100' X 100' marble room. Al-Ghazi greets the Prince formally: kiss the right shoulder near the clavicle. The Prince's tongue chalk-white for some reason. In Arabic: 
PRINCE BIN KHALED Four FBI Agents will be allowed to land at Prince Sultan Air Base this evening. 
Al-Ghazi: more than mild shock. 
PRINCE BIN KHALED (CONT'D) General Abdul-Malik, Chief of Investigative Services for the National Guard has been put in- charge of solving this crime. 
Clearly not sitting well with Al-Ghazi. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI I know the General. I attended his interrogation of one of my men. (beat, putting it kindly:) The General does not have investigative experience. 
PRINCE BIN KHALED Attackers wore YOUR uniform. Police Uniforms. Some of your men may have been involved with this Cell, may still be involved. You're lucky to have a role at all. 
Al-Ghazi silent. The Prince pulls an anti-acid tablet, puts it in his mouth: that's why his tongue is chalk-white. 
ADAM LEAVITT Israeli stamp in my passport? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (in Arabic to the Officer) That is not our concern. 
Al-Ghazi takes the passports and badges, hands them back. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) I'm also to collect your sidearms. 
This is like handing over your first-born. Fleury goes first. Haytham puts each weapon in a padded case. 
GRANT SYKES And I usually just toss it on the kitchen table... 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (small smile) If each of you would please get into the middle vehicle. 
61   INT. MIDDLE SUBURBAN, RIYADH SUBURBS - NIGHT                61 
The speedometer at 110 m.p.h. Haytham navigates with his left hand. Prayer beads hang from the rearview mirror. Al-Ghazi in the passenger seat, right hand rubbing another set of prayer beads down to nubs. The team in the back rows: all staring at the prayer beads on the mirror. 
JANET MAYES (whispering to Leavitt) Wouldn't need the power a' prayer if there were 2 hands on the wheel. 
ADAM LEAVIIT 110 miles per hour... How do you keep so calm? I mean, really? Is it breathing-- 
JANET MAYES --Shhhh.... 
RONALD FLEURY If somebody was tailing us it'd be obvious. This is just standard operating speed. 
Al-Ghazi on the edge of his seat, no belt, scanning for threats: sidewalks, traffic, rooftops. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06    50. 
His left hand hand wrapped around the stock of an Mp-5 machine gun. Fleury takes in a deep breath: let's see who this guy is. 
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) Colonel, have you ever been to the US? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI I have been there only once. I spent four days at Quantico... I saw your Michael Jordan play for the Washington Wizards. 
Small laughs. 
RONALD FLEURY You don't know what you missed... you should have seen him play for our Chicago Bulls. 
Fleury nods to Sykes, giving him the go to start in with the Bad Cop. Throughout the following exchange, we stay TIGHT ON FLEURY: in control, using Sykes to ask the questions he "diplomatically" does not want to ask. 
GRANT SYKES You have portable lights on-scene? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (loses his smile) Yes. But your team cannot work nights. 
Janet looks to Leavitt, then Fleury: `what did he say?' Fleury looks to Sykes, `Keep going...' 
GRANT SYKES We only have seven days: we work around the clock. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI Five days. And you are not safe at night. 
GRANT SYKES We're safe during the day? 
Fleury is about to step in when- 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (in Arabic, shocking) WATCH IT-SLOW! 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   51. 
A truck 200 yards ahead in the middle of an abrupt U-turn. Over the median. Dust cloud. Heading back our way. Something big in the truck's bed. Our vehicle shimmies as Al-Ghazi flinches, drops his prayer beads. Mp-5 up to the Colonel's sight-line, muzzle tracking the truck. Leavitt leans away from his window as the vehicles pass: streetlights show two farmers, a camel sitting in the bed. Missed their left turn. 
A long, nearly comical moment. 
ADAM LEAVITT (smartass) I don't like camels. 
Fleury cycling through different angles. Continues: 
RONALD FLEURY Colonel, do you believe Abu Hamza was responsible for this attack? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI We don't know. 
RONALD FLEURY Were Saudi Police involved in the attack? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI We don't know that either. 
RONALD FLEURY Any word on what that third big blast was? 
Al-Ghazi getting tired of the questions: exhausted himself. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI Not yet. 
GRANT SYKES You interviewed witnesses? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (short-fuse burning) We're trying. No one who was close enough to see the things we would like to know, lived. 
GRANT SYKES Were any of the uniformed bombers brother-officers? 
No answer.

GRANT SYKES (CONT'D) Do you know yet? 
No answer. Team feeling the tension. Fleury steps in and takes charge. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI Sunrise. 
RONALD FLEURY What time is sunrise? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (beat) When I knock. 
Al-Ghazi and Haytham leave. The doors close behind them, then the sound of a key turning in a lock. The Americans look on, half-disbelief, half-comedy: locking us in. 
GRANT SYKES That's against fire code. 
JANET MAYES They don't have fire codes. They don't have codes other than codes of war. They'll lock us in and dial up some kind of earth movers if they want to. You know that, Sykes. Dig a big hole and push us in. Fill it up and no one comes calling. You're in the jungle now, baby. 
Silence as the crew digests this odd little verbal outage. 
ADAM LEAVITT (smiling) You alright, girl? 
JANET MAYES Watch it, boy. 
ADAM LEAVITT Just asking... 
JANET MAYES Unpack. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   57. 
Everyone hits their own bags first. 
FLEURY (to himself) Saudi slow roll... 
Fleury pulls out his laptop, wakes it up from sleep mode. Eyes a photo of Kevin on his desktop, picks up the phone. 
LYLA FLEURY (on phone) Hello? 
RONALD FLEURY Hey... How are you? How's my boy? 
LYLA FLEURY We're just fine. How are you? Where are you? 
RONALD FLEURY I'm here... (quick beat) Lemme talk to my boy. 
A BEAT as Lyla passes the phone to Kevin. 
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) Daddy? 
FLEURY What you doing? 
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) I'm talking to you. What are you doing right now, Daddy? Right now? 
FLEURY I'm missing you. 
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) Where are you? 
FLEURY I'm in Saudi Arabia. 
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) Did you see Big Fran? 
A Beat... 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   58. 
FLEURY Yeah... I saw him... (PAUSE) I saw him. 
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) Is he still tall? 
FLEURY Yeah... Yeah...he's still tall. 
Silence... as Fleury takes a beat to collect himself. 
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) Daddy? Are you still there? 
FLEURY Yeah, buddy. I love you. Keep your eye on your mama. Be the man. 
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) You, too Daddy. 
FLEURY I'll call you tomorrow. I love you. 
KEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) Bye, Daddy. 
Fleury begins unpacking. 
68   EXT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - 4:30 AM                    68 
Pre-dawn: Eight black suburbans parked on the side street: waiting. The doors of the first four open in-unison. 20 Arab, suited SECURITY GUARDS exit. 
Al-Ghazi unlocks the door to the compound: the team stands dressed, waiting. CLOSE-UP: The Team steps out to see massive, organized security. 
From one of the vehicles exits a middle aged AMERICAN - sweating a bit, hanging back, watching. This is US Deputy Chief of Mission, the Embassy's second-in-command: DAMON SCHMIDT. 
Another 100 Security CONTRACTORS remain vigilant: SNIPERS on roof-tops, in machine-gun nests. 
Schmidt approaches Fleury. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06    59. 
SCHMIDT (big smile) You are in so much trouble. 
FLEURY Is that right? 
100 soldiers immediately drop to their knees. 
69    INT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER HOOPS COURT - 9:00 AM         69 
TIGHT ON FLEURY: focused, Thinking. Sykes next to him. 
O.C. The Athan sounds again for Dhuhr. 
SYKES Well, this is going well... 
FLEURY Saudi Slow Roll. 
Sykes and Fleury lean against the locked door, staring at the pathetic sight before them: Janet's truly awful jumper... that somehow swishes every time. Before she lands, cocky and smooth: 
JANET MAYES Good. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   63. 
Then the metallic swish of the all-weather net. Leavitt boxes out air for the non-existent rebound, grabs the ball, chest- passes it Great Santini-hard back to Janet who softly sucks in the pass. Playing in their cargo pants and hiking boots. 
LEAVITT How do you do that? 
Janet gently bounce-passes it back: 
JANET MAYES Check. 
LEAVITT Don't say `good' again. 
Janet takes the check from Leavitt: before he can react, she drains a 30-footer. Same cockiness, different word: 
JANET Bueno. 
Fleury with Sykes still standing in the same spot. Looks up: Al-Ghazi coming into the building. Fleury ready to vent until something surprises him: breathless, Al-Ghazi has broken a wide-sweat hustling back to the Americans. Fleury's face relaxes. He pulls a bottle of water out of a cooler, hands it to Al-Ghazi. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI I am sorry for the time. (beat) You won't need you gear. 
Fleury can't help a small smile. 
FLEURY (to Sykes, himself) Of course we won't. 
70   EXT. AL-RAHMAH - MOMENTS LATER                              70 
Hands in pockets. Soak in the aftermath: shallow but wide crater, shredded backstop, nearby buildings torn, blood baked into dirt. Fifteen cars. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) The remaining rules: you cannot touch evidence, question anyone without me present, touch Muslim dead, or leave my sight at anytime: your safety is my primary concern. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   64. 
FLEURY I would have thought your primary concern was investigating a crime. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI And you would be mistaken. 
Sykes looks over to Fleury. Crooked smile. 
SYKES (to Fleury) I think it's one of those "something happens to us... his head comes off" kind of deals. (to Al-Ghazi) Is it one of those kind of deals, Colonel? 
Al-Ghazi ignores Sykes. 
FLEURY So, if you're not running the investigation...who is? 
Al-Ghazi motions to 50 MEN in uniforms different than his: SANG troops digging, bagging evidence, marking the scene with red-flags. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI The National Guard's Military Police Brigade is conducting the investigation. My orders begin and end with your health. 
The Team: so we're on Tour. Fleury still silent. 
ADAM LEAVITT I thought the SANG were soldiers-- 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI --the bombers didn't wear a soldier's uniform. They wore mine. 
Fleury finally speaks, asking the most important question: 
RONALD FLEURY Who is in charge of the investigation then? 
Al-Ghazi points to a Man we've seen before, General Abdul- Malik. Haytham's Interrogator. He pours over a table 20 feet away: maps, blueprints, utility schematics spread before him. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   65. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI General Abdul-Malik. He's given us permission to walk through each crime-scene. 
RONALD FLEURY To walk through? Are you kidding me? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI I am not. 
Starting to get heated. 
RONALD FLEURY Get him over here now and let's clarify this situation. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI There is no lack of clarification. 
RONALD FLEURY There sure as hell is! I don't know what kind of game you're playing but you got the wrong guy, Colonel Al-Ghazi! That was not the deal- 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (getting hot) This is not a game show, Mr. Fleury! There are no deals made here. There is me telling you what you may or may not do and there is you doing it. 
Beat. As Al-Ghazi stabilizes... 
RONALD FLEURY Mr. Aaron Jackson? 
AARON JACKSON (re: Al-Ghazi) Get him away from me- 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   69. 
RONALD FLEURY -easy, Sir. He's a friend to us- 
AARON JACKSON -I don't know either one a' you. 
RONALD FLEURY I'm Special Agent Ronald Fleury of the FBI. This is Colonel Al-Ghazi with the Saudi State Police- 
AARON JACKSON -the Police: they attacked. 
Al-Ghazi quietly backs away, walks away. Fleury looks after him, turns back to Mr. Jackson who stares after Al-Ghazi: hate. Fleury unsure what to do next. 
AARON JACKSON (CONT'D) I just put my boys down for the first time in two days. I can't wake `em and sure as hell can't be gone if they stir on their own. 
RONALD FLEURY Can I come back? 
AARON JACKSON (too loud) WHY? 
RONALD FLEURY Your boys... 
Jackson remembers the warning he just spoke... 
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) To ask about two nights ago. 
Fresh tears re-animate his face: 
AARON JACKSON When my wife's jaw was shot off in front of our sons? My sons who sat with her while she bled to death? Couldn't speak because she didn't have the bottom of her face and I wasn't home and my baby boys are destroyed for life and my five year- old had a box of band-aids in his hand when I finally got home? 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   70. 
Silence outside of Mr. Jackson's sobbing. Fleury sick to his stomach. Desperate to let this man alone. No eye contact. 
RONALD FLEURY ...I won't pretend to know... 
Aaron Jackson settles, wipes away tears, appreciates the honesty. Then bites back into his rage: 
AARON JACKSON Kill everyone that had something to do with this. Everyone related to them. Everyone who knew them. (beat) And all you'd be doing is their recruiting for them... It's an entire generation: not small and isolated like they say. But a generation that thinks what they did to my wife, to my children, is a "calling"... 
RONALD FLEURY Up the street, there was a wreck, did you see any- 
AARON JACKSON -notice how it wouldn't take a lot to disguise your friend (points to Al-Ghazi) as a Mexican? Think he couldn't handle crossing our deserts? Look around! 
RONALD FLEURY Aaron- 
AARON JACKSON (explodes) -LET ME FINISH GOD DAMN YOU- 
A child's scream from inside. Piercing. Scary. Jackson goes red, clenched fists, steps to Fleury who takes an instinctive step backward, guard-up. Jackson stops, spins back inside. A door slam that rattles the plywood sheet covering the shattered window. The screams become night terror shrieks. 
74   EXT. JACKSON HOME                                            74 
A LONG, SAD BEAT, as Fleury and Al-Ghazi stand alone in front of the Jackson house. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   71. 
RONALD FLEURY (to Al-Ghazi) Can we tour the compound? Can we please do that? 
Slow nod from Al-Ghazi. 
75   EXT. BOMB SITE - LATER                                      75 
The team tours the site. 
As they fan out. They walk casually, but focused through the first bomb site. An inquisitive Mayes, already peering into a mostly in-tact car, halfway out of its parking spot. Al-Ghazi and Haytham watch the Americans like mother-hens. 
JANET MAYES He or she almost made it. 
Fleury steps, looks inside: blood and safety glass coat the seat. Janet points to keys in the ignition: still at the `on' position. Then the stick-shift, pulled to the back right: reverse. The shift-knob bloody... 
JANET MAYES (CONT'D) (beat, quieter) Makes me think of the Trade Centers -- the people on the floors above the impacts -- no matter how fast or strong or smart you are, if you're in the wrong spot, `it' will not let you get away. 
FLEURY That's what makes this a War. 
Sykes notices something on the ground... he picks up a military detonator, discretely hands it over to Fleury. Fleury quietly pockets it. 
76   EXT. THIRD BLAST SITE - MOMENTS LATER                       76 
Structures 100 feet away look like they've been hit with a God-sized sawed-off. The crater: 25-feet wide, 7-feet deep. Blackened frames and bits of vehicles circle the crater. The bottom of the crater filled with water. A syphon-pump works overtime. No SANG Investigators around. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) About one hour into the rescue. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   72. 
ADAM LEAVITT Hit a water main? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI No -- from the tanks of this fire engine: that's the water that didn't evaporate in the blast. 
Al-Ghazi points to a mass of black metal: looks like a fire truck the way a Jackson Pollock looks like the Mona Lisa. Leavitt and Grant stand back. Quiet: 
GRANT SYKES (eyes on Fleury) Hole is the case. See, there's "evidence" down in that hole. You understand evidence? Little things that are "clues." Clues can be very helpful to a fella when he's trying to solve a crime. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI I understand that. 
JANET MAYES The same Mosque is enough to identify them, link them to a cell? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI Yes. If the Mosque is in Suweidi. 
ADAM LEAVITT Suweidi? 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   76. 
JANET MAYES Suweidi is a known militant stonghold. Al-Qaeda could recruit from storefronts. 
On Fleury: he looks back at the homes, then up and around: He locks on the OBSERVATION BUILDING in the distance. 
FLEURY Can we go to check out some of these surrounding buildings? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI Why? 
FLEURY Seems reasonable that the Planner had to observe and based on Hamza's past history, it's consistent that he would want to video the attack. Is that true? Is that accurate? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI That is true. 
RONALD FLEURY Well, in order to video, in order to observe, you need a view. 
Fleury points to one particular building. 
FLEURY That building sees all three crime scenes. 
Al-Ghazi looks up to the building. Back to Fleury. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (beat) It's outside the walls- 
ADAM LEAVITT -c'mon now. This is insane: we got enough security to invade Suweidi, let alone that building- 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI -no you don't. 
FLEURY (to Al-Ghazi, respectful) Could you ask? (MORE) 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   77. 
FLEURY (CONT'D) We're already seeing the crime- scenes individually -- why not all at once? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI Any answer will take- 
FLEURY -time. I understand. 
Fleury speaks slowly and clearly now: like he's cementing his words in his own head as he speaks them. 
FLEURY (CONT'D) You have to ask the General, then the General would ask the Prince. Does it go higher or is that... is the Prince the end of the chain? 
Al-Ghazi hesitates, can't help but be charmed. Fleury clearly knows when to step-on or lay-off the gas. He's smooth... and HIGHLY EFFECTIVE: Al-Ghazi nods `yes' to the strange half- question. 
FLEURY (CONT'D) We'll be at the Community Center. (beat) Janet, wanna play hoops? 
78   INT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER HOOPS COURT - NOON           78 
We're in the big gym as our team sits and waits. Leavitt taps on a laptop. 
Janet shoots free throws by herself. 
JANET MAYES This is the kind of radical circumstance that could have seriously upped Shaq's free throw percentages. Take a man. Ship him off to Riyadh. No phones, constant threat of death, no girls, no hip hop. Nothing... just free throws. Shaq, he'd be shooting at least seventy percent. Lakers would still be together. Kobe and Shaq lovers forever. 
Leavitt calls to Fleury. 
LEAVITT Hey, Boss... check this out. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06     78. 
Fleury moves over to Leavitt. Checks out the screen. 
LEAVITT (CONT'D) Just posted half hour ago. 
IMAGES ON THE COMPUTER: ARABIC EXTREMIST WEBSITE. Video footage shot from the rooftop of all three bombings and some of the machine gun killings. 
LEAVITT (CONT'D) So self congratulatory. Makes me sick. 
Fleury studies the footage. Backs it up plays it again and again. 
78A   INT. LOCATION UNKNOWN - TIME UNKNOWN                        78A 
A set of stronger, younger, in-tact hands gently pours a mixture into a box now. Ball bearings, children's jacks, marbles, razor blades, roofing nails: everything malevolent densities and angles. Some pieces bounce out, run along the floor. The younger hands then start pressing/molding the pieces of soon-to-be shrapnel into the putty. 
79    EXT. RIYADH SUBURB NEAR COMPOUND - AFTERNOON                 79 
Five car convoy moving quickly through the city. 
80    EXT. SPOTTER APARTMENT- LATER                                80 
Our convoy pulls up in front of the apartment. They exit the vehicles. Our team stands surrounded by a 50-man security detail, rifle-stocks to shoulders. Double-time it - outside the walls now, hostile territory. Two-man sniper teams out front. Al-Ghazi ten steps ahead. 
A SANG five car security CREW pulls up, tracking Fleury and company. A stand off between the two police forces. 
81    EXT. SPOTTER APARTMENT - NEXT MOMENT                         81 
The SANG Officer in-charge steps to Al-Ghazi. In Arabic: 
SANG OFFICER This is unacceptable. 
Al-Ghazi stands still, silent. Fleury reaches into his pocket. Reveals the detonator to Al-Ghazi. Al-Ghazi reaches to take it. Fleury holds it for a BEAT... 
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) Let me help you. 
He hands the detonator to Al-Ghazi.    Al-Ghazi now pockets it. 
A BEAT... 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI We break now: too hot to work outdoors. Then we will leave for the Palace. 
RONALD FLEURY And I imagine that will run until sundown? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (beat) I had televisions delivered to your quarters to pass the downtime. 
Fleury just nods back. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) Miss Mayes will not attend this evening. Men only. 
Fleury looks over to Janet. Hurt, yet extremely defiant, she looks ready to attack anything that comes near her. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   83. 
FLEURY You want to tell her that? 
83   EXT. CHEVY SUBURBAN, RIYADH SUBURBS - EARLY EVENING           83 
Cobra gunships covering the convoy as it blurs past police checkpoint after police checkpoint. Intersections shut down. Bracketed front and back by Saudi Humvees. 
84   INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN, RIYADH SUBURBS - NEXT MOMENT             84 
Al-Ghazi in the passenger seat, hand on the stock of his Mp- 5: again searching for threats. Our team in back, freshly scrubbed, collared-Polos as formal as anyone thought to pack. Team frustration has evolved into angry acceptance. 
The convoy zipping alongside a wall now: desert-orange in color, twelve-feet high, blue ottoman tiles running the length of the wall's horizontal center-line. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI We're here. 
The helicopters peel off at steep angles, the sound of the rotors reverberating in your chest. Leavitt watching them go: 
ADAM LEAVITT Big wall. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI It's a big palace. 
85   INT. PRINCE BIN KHALED'S PALACE - DAY                         85 
Majlis - a Saudi political ceremony in which Saudi citizens and local politicians (most aristocratic and exclusive) are permitted a brief audience with the Prince. A bizarre receiving line of sorts. 
Our team moves through a massive marble hallway towards the ceremony. 
ADAM LEAVITT How many Princes are there? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI Over 5000. 
RONALD FLEURY They all get palaces this big? 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   84. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI Some get bigger. 
ADAM LEAVITT Who pays for all this? 
GRANT SYKES General Motors, Ford, Chevrolet... 
ADAM LEAVITT Hey, man - I drive a Hybrid. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (a beat...) The Prince will ask you about your flight, the accommodations...lite subjects. If he offers you the chance to hold his Raptors, don't flinch: it's a compliment. 
ADAM LEAVITT (to Grant: genuine worry) What's a Raptor? 
Damon Schmidt appears. 
85A   INT. PRINCE BIN KHALED'S PALACE - LATER                      85A 
The Prince sits on a sea of pillows. There are several small flat screens playing business reports, CNN and Al-Jazeera. 
Seen from behind the Prince: everyone but Leavitt standing next to faces we've never seen. The table holds six gold serving platters. Enough food to kill a famine, tended by a frenzy of servants. 
Sykes puts a hand over his cup to stop the constant tea re- fill. 
Leavitt stands to the Prince's left, thick leather glove on his hand, a falcon perched on it. Leavitt holds it away from the rest of his body like he's already made peace with losing the arm. Servants hold three others close-by. 
PRINCE BIN KHALED His talons slice bone. 
ADAM LEAVITT Super. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   85. 
PRINCE BIN KHALED That's my most prolific Hunter. I'm trying to teach his friends there by example, but I fear it's something you're born with or not. Do you agree, Mr. Ronald? Innate or not at all? 
RONALD FLEURY I do. 
PRINCE BIN KHALED (nodding: I could tell) What have you seen so far of our Kingdom? -- and know I can arrange tours anywhere within our borders. 
When I bull-rush our hosts you'll know it: In his quiet, calm- amidst-the-bullets tone: 
RONALD FLEURY I've seen that the man who planned the worst crime in your Kingdom's history is without a doubt Saudi... 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI From now on, any evidence you find you hand over. 
Al-Ghazi smiles... 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) I'm "all ears," Special Agent Fleury. 
RONALD FLEURY We should start with the dead shooters. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI They had no identification on them. Fingerprints and dental have come up empty. 
RONALD FLEURY Can we photograph all three of them? Couple hundred copies each... 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI No problem. 
RONALD FLEURY Good. If it's OK with you, I'd like to suggest we split up as follows... 
Sykes and Leavitt can't help small smiles. Finally getting to work. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   89A. 
a89   EXT. BLAST SITE - MORNING                                  a89 
Sykes climbs down into the mud hole. 
GRANT SYKES (from the crater) Fellas, what we want to do is get this water out of here... see what's really going on. Understand? 
No reaction from Saudi police 
GRANT SYKES (CONT'D) C-VIN hunting--Data Plates-- Something drivable blew up. That's pretty obvious. Feels like ANFO to me, boys--Ammonium Nitrate Fuel Oil. Let's dry this hole and see if we can't figure what she was. Gotta pump? 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   90. 
89   EXT. BLAST SITE - LATER                                      89 
Grant at the Crater. Three brand-new industrial-sized pumps draining it. 30 Police INVESTIGATORS watch Sykes. 
GRANT SYKES (to the Saudis) Got to get a little dirty, people. Crawl up in it. Make deep contact. You get that? 
Dead, confused stares from the Saudis into the mud hole... Sykes happy as a pig in shit. 
GRANT SYKES (CONT'D) Get nasty, dirty, filthy. 
He smiles, watches another Officer write Saudi translations on the stainless-steel paint cans into which you load evidence: shrapnel, soil, DNA, shells, etc. 
90   EXT. DEATH SQUAD SCENE, AL-RAHMAH - SAME MOMENT              90 
A JUNIOR OFFICER double-times it to Al-Ghazi with a stack of photos: Rough head-shots of the three dead SHOOTERS. Fleury takes some, hands the rest back to Al-Ghazi. 
RONALD FLEURY Have him pass these out to the compound security. See if anybody knows them. 
Fleury, Leavitt, and Al-Ghazi walk past the Land Cruiser Haytham took out. 15 Police INVESTIGATORS on-scene: Leavitt stops, drops his bag. Al-Ghazi introduces him to the Officer in-charge. 
Leavitt opens his evidence kit. A couple of Police can't help but sneak a peek, checking out what the American's got inside. 
91   INT. RIPON HOME - LATER                                      91 
Fleury stands with Al-Ghazi back in the Ripon home. 
RONALD FLEURY Would you mind doing one more thing for me? 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   91. 
EARL No, Sir. 
Fleury pulls out the photographs. 
RONALD FLEURY Could you tell me if you recognize any of these men? 
Fleury puts the three photographs down on the dining room table: not pretty pictures. Earl and Janine study the photos. 
JANINE ...Horrible. 
A few moments, then: 
EARL I don't know any of them. 
Fleury thinks a minute. Looks outside. 
FLEURY I'm just wondering. That chair out side. Looks like it gets a lot of wear. Looks comfortable. 
EARL That my mom's chair. 
FLEURY See, that's exactly what I was thinking. I'm guessing she spends a lot of time sitting outside? 
EARL All day. 
FLEURY She must pretty much see it all. Right? 
EARL She does. 
FLEURY Where is she? 
EARL She's sleeping. 
Pause: Fleury slow nods, then... 
Aaron Jackson begins shaking his head yes. Tears flow free: sorrow and gratitude. He hangs on to Fleury's hand for a very long time. Silent apologies. 
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) I will find the man responsible for the death of your wife. We're close. 
AARON JACKSON (beat) Tomorrow it'll be somebody else's wife. 
Fleury quiet. 
RONALD FLEURY Then tomorrow I'll come back. 
Fleury turns his head: Al-Ghazi approaches on the next lawn down with three JUNIOR OFFICERS. Fleury nods goodbye to Jackson. 
Fleury approaches Al-Ghazi, holds up the Shooter's photo. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI The gardener. We know who he is. He's on several watch lists. 
Fleury - a slight nod of satisfaction. 
RONALD FLEURY We know where he lives? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI We will very soon. 
RONALD FLEURY You don't seem very excited. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI These are always the easy ones to catch. Rarely does it lead to the planners. (beat) I want to take you somewhere. 
RONALD FLEURY Where? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI To someone who may be able to help us catch Hamza. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   96. 
96   EXT. BLAST SITE - DAY                                        96 
Ten Police Investigators in the crater with Grant. Outside the crater: pieces of vehicles laid out outside: 1/2 of a door, 1/4 of a front axle, bits of engine. Five feet away from that: stacks of bagged evidence, two dozen evidence containers. 
Sykes clambers out of the hole, streaks of re-animated mud where sweat streams out of his hairline, mad-dashing for his chin. A chunk of metal in one hand, something small in the other: a marble. He drops it in the appropriate cannister then steps to a chunk of metal: one half of an alternator. 
Sykes stares down at the pieces of completely mangled metal. He studies a piece of twisted, half-melted iron. Thinking... 
He walks over to a second larger piece of twisted metal. Starts trying to fit the two pieces...like a puzzle. 
97   INT. MOBILE FIELD MORGUE, PRESENT DAY - NOON                 97 
The dead, oblong faces of the dog-walkers. Janet uses forceps to pull a wing-nut from one of the dog-walkers. Places it on a sanitary table littered with shrapnel: tiny bits of colored glass, ball-bearings, parts of razor blades, spent slugs, and scraps of unidentified metal. 
98   EXT. BLAST SITE - CRATER                                     98 
Sykes still works the two large pieces of trashed iron. Until something clicks. The fit. Sykes looks down at the connected metal. 
SYKES It's a gurney. 
Sykes looks down at the mud colored DIGGERS. 
SYKES (CONT'D) Who's missing an ambulance? 
Just stares from the Saudis. 
SYKES (CONT'D) Could somebody please go get Sergeant Haytham? 
Confused stares from the Saudis. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   97. 
SYKES (CONT'D) (loud) Sergeant Haytham! 
Inside the crater: water-level down to the ankles. Three Saudis dig around what looks to be one of the dualie-style back tires. Re-positioning to get a better grip, Sykes notices the top of what looks to be a sizeable, ragged hole, still mostly submerged. Pointing: 
GRANT SYKES Here. 
Sykes slogs over. He drops to his knees, reaches his hand in, all the way to his shoulder, the side of his face to the water: void. Out of the crater, Sykes points to a Bobcat earth-mover, in Arabic: 
GRANT SYKES (CONT'D) Who has the keys? 
99    INT. / EXT. MOBILE FIELD MORGUE - SAME                       99 
Janet stands with the Saudi Pathologist. She prepares to take a fingerprint from a body. As the moves in to touch the Arab hand, one of the GUARDS unloads in her direction - a full guttural Arabic assault. No idea what he's saying, but it's obvious he's furious. Haytham starts firing back. This is an un-translated argument. We sense that the guard is doing more than expressing his displeasure regarding Janet. This seems to be personal. Janet's getting very nervous. A frightening display. Then, Haytham turns: 
HAYTHAM You cannot touch any Muslims. 
Janet takes a breath as the Police hard-eye her. 
JANET No problem. Can I still touch Americans? 
HAYTHAM Of course. 
Janet moves back to the American dead, as the Saudi Tech continues with the Muslims. She pulls another shard of COLORED GLASS from a wound. 
100   INT./ EXT. SUBURBAN - DOWNTOWN RIYADH                       100 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   98. 
SERIES OF SHOTS: 
A two car convoy drives deep into the city. 
RONALD FLEURY JANET... 
Janet makes her way back. Immediately moves to the wounded SWAT Officer. 
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) He's gone... This shrapnel look like the stuff you pulled at the morgue? 
JANET MAYES (distracted) Yeah... I pulled so much it's hard to remember it all. 
RONALD FLEURY Bolts? 
JANET MAYES Yes. 
RONALD FLEURY Wing nuts? 
JANET MAYES Yeah. 
RONALD FLEURY Razor blades? 
JANET MAYES Sure. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   109. 
Al-Ghazi begins tossing the room, motions to Fleury: help. Fleury moves to him. 
RONALD FLEURY (calling back) ADAM... 
GRANT SYKES C-4... 
Al-Ghazi dumps desk drawers: pictures of government-looking buildings, walled-compounds. Lays them out in rows, studying each. Leavitt appears, focuses on the C-4 immediately. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) -the front gates of every other western housing compound in Riyadh. 
Everybody looks at the Colonel, pointing at the pictures: 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) And Embassies: Italy, Japan, Korea, Norway, England... 
ADAM LEAVITT (beat) The Coalition... 
Leavitt steps, scans the pictures, picks up two in particular: buildings with scaffolding and heavy equipment. 
ADAM LEAVITT (CONT'D) These are all countries with Troops in Iraq -- Japanese and Italian embassies are under construction? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI The entire Diplomatic Quarter is being retro-fitted to sustain bigger bomb blasts. 
Janet pops her head in: 
JANET MAYES -the Prince's Convoy just showed. 
Al-Ghazi's face: fear. 
RONALD FLEURY This is bullshit. You know it. Meaningless. There's no leader here. These are kids. That's it. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   110. 
Al-Ghazi says nothing. 
JANET MAYES We're out of here. 
RONALD FLEURY Yes, that's it. Smile for the cameras, body-bag some children. Wrap it up, but us -- out. I get it. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI I'm sorry. 
111   EXT. FRONT OF TARGETED HOME - MOMENTS LATER                   111 
Prince Bin Khaled touring the scene: reporters, photographers, his personal top-line security detail: the business suits and boots, the special ops M-4s. All on edge to be in a Saudi neighborhood. Rahman, looking like he needs sleep and vitamins. Lecturing in Arabic: 
PRINCE BIN KHALED Only in death will our enemies realize Allah never permits defiance of his almighty will. 
Damon Schmidt trailing behind the Prince's detail. The Prince locks Al-Ghazi with a mad-dog stare in-between lesson points. One of the Prince's inner-circle heads straight for Al-Ghazi, in Arabic: 
INNER-CIRCLE Take the Americans inside now and keep them out of sight. You will be spoken to about their presence here. 
112   INT. TARGETED HOUSE - NEXT MOMENT                             112 
The Team sitting on the floor, below the window sills, away from the holes and doors. Al-Ghazi standing, looking out the window at the spectacle. Damon Schmidt steps in: sees dead bodies and goes ghost, almost collapses. Leavitt pops up, helps him sit. 
RONALD FLEURY You need water? 
A quick `no' nod: like the second before you lose lunch. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   111. 
ADAM LEAVITT You really ought not look at this. 
DAMON SCHMIDT (pointing at the dead) That fella got shot right through his God damn nipple... 
JANET MAYES Don't stare too long. It'll start living in your dreams. 
Janet's voice causes Schmidt to immediately force composure. 
DAMON SCHMIDT No -- I know. 
RONALD FLEURY You do? (beat) How did you know we were here? 
DAMON SCHMIDT The Prince has Men at Al-Rahmah. 
Al-Ghazi gets to the CB radio, in Arabic: 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) Tighten up- 
-the trailing Suburban doesn't `tighten up.' It falls further back. Fleury instinctively turns, wide-eyed -- out the window: a small brown truck swerves out of the opposing lanes, flying across the desert median, aimed at the Convoy. Without hesitation Fleury reaches over Haytham, rips the steering-wheel right, nosing away from the approach... 
114   114 THRU 116 OMITTED                                       114 
117   EXT. SAUDI HIGHWAY - SAME MOMENT                           117 
Our Suburban on two wheels: The lead Suburban turns the same direction a twitch too late. The small brown truck detonates. The lead Suburban takes a massive fraction of the explosion broadside, essentially shielding our vehicle. Flame spits through the lead vehicle as it spins, flips onto its roof. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   116. 
118   INT. OUR SUBURBAN - NEXT MOMENT                             118 
Off-road now, violent impacts on bare rims shedding rubber. 
119   EXT. HIGHWAY ATTACK AFTERMATH - NEXT MOMENT                 119 
The lead Suburban: tortoise on its back, engulfed, still sliding. Fleury's Suburban fish-tailing. 
The Lead Suburban blows in-half now as the gas tank ruptures. A football-sized shard of metal explodes through our windshield- 
120   INT. OUR SUBURBAN - SAME MOMENT                             120 
- and smashes straight out the back, taking the rear cargo door with it. 
The shock of it causes Haytham to lose control in earnest now. The Suburban flips, barrel rolls. Violent pounding inside the vehicle. Motion stops: upside down, just the roar of the big Detroit V-8 red-lining, wheels spinning in air. Everyone dazed, border-line unconscious. Fleury's bell rung the worst, trying to function, get his bearings. 
Fleury touches Leavitt's face, can barely see through the gathering smoke that smells like oil. 
RONALD FLEURY You whole? 
ADAM LEAVITT Think so- 
Leavitt unbuckles his seat belt and smashes head first into the ceiling -- running FOOTFALLS approach, quick yell-yips in Arabic: commands? 
The Driver and three other Police Officers from the trailing Suburban. Smoke fills the interior now: thank God these Police Officers have ripped open a door: saviors. They grip Leavitt by his hair because it's the only thing they can grab. 
Alarmed, Al-Ghazi begins to scramble for Leavitt. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI This is not right! 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   117. 
Haytham gets a good look at the driver, recognizes him as the officer who shamed him at the compound on day one. Haytham moves to unbuckle. 
Fleury's trying to claw towards Leavitt. Throwing upside down punches at the air. Unbuckles himself now. 
RONALD FLEURY WHAT THE- 
JANET MAYES (panicked) ADAM! WHAT -- WHAT ARE THEY DOING? 
Alarm rising, everyone else unbuckles and smashes into the ceiling as horizons go flip-flop confusion. 
121   EXT. HIGHWAY ATTACK AFTERMATH - NEXT MOMENT                 121 
Leavitt's throwing punches as he's dragged with velocity to the trail Suburban, idling. Pistol-whipped viciously, repeatedly until they're able to kick him inside. Another Officer from the trailing vehicle steps up with an AK-47, pulls back the cocking mechanism, ready to spray the dazed occupants of our Suburban- 
-the Officer's ankles and shins detonate. POP-POP-POP-POP from the driver's seat: Haytham. Screams from the would-be shooter at double volume. Haytham keeps firing as the Officer, hit multiple times, falls hard. 
The trailing Suburban hesitates,   slams into our Suburban just as Fleury is getting out of the    wreckage. Everybody else still inside, knocked silly. The   trailing Suburban backs up quick. Fleury instinctively goes   for his holster: empty for days now. 
RONALD FLEURY GUN! 
Trailing Suburban accelerates away now, as Janet struggles out. Haytham's 9 MM in-hand racked open: empty. Fleury steps away from the now black smoke pouring from the vehicle -- in the passenger seat of the trail Suburban, he sees the Officer that checked passports at Prince Sultan Air Base. 
GRANT SYKES -DOOR HELP- 
Fleury rips Grant's door open. Trapped smoke billows, clears: Grant's arm closest to the outside of the vehicle dangles at an unnatural angle, bleeding badly. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   118. 
GRANT SYKES (CONT'D) Can't release- 
Fleury begins sawing Grant's seat-belt with a jagged piece of metal. 
RONALD FLEURY Hands up -- you're gonna fall- 
Sykes still does, ugly. Fleury and Janet rip him free of the Suburban. 
Haytham's pulling shotguns, handguns, ammo from the flipped vehicle. Haytham pointing ahead, to the fading roster-tail. In Arabic: 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM They're going to disappear... 
Desperate, Fleury looks in the direction of the fleeing Suburban: the rooster-tail it leaves getting smaller. Al- Ghazi nods, swings his head to thesnarled/wrecked highway traffic. PEOPLE hesitantly step toward uniforms they trust on instinct. Haytham dumps the pile of weapons at the Team's feet, re-loads his 9MM. Janet ties a half-assed tourniquet around Sykes' reminder of an arm. 
Al-Ghazi steps toward the approaching crowd: they see his state, his gun, and turn back: panic starts to infect the larger mass, then the topper- 
-AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE from somewhere. Glass-dirt-metal bursts around us: this attack is still going. 
Fleury looks up: just the roof of an old Mercedes on the median, dirt kicked up behind them, running behind lines of stopped-wrecked traffic now. The barrel of a rifle held high out the window like a taunt. Accelerating for another opening to finish the job. 
Scared motorists devolve into terrified motorists. Many have abandoned their vehicles to sprint into the desert, the rest go smash-'em-up derby-folly: 50 panicked drivers aiming for the same spots. Fleury snatches an M4A1 from the stack dropped by Haytham, up to his shoulder, hustling toward the next break in traffic. The Mercedes is approaching at 80 MPH. 
A second passes: these people know where the attackers went. Al-Ghazi locks eyes with a little boy... he quickly-quietly just shakes his head no. In the back, Sykes has fallen on his back. He looks up through the window: sees a shape jet past on the top of the closest building -- three stories up: the little boy was nodding a warning- 
What follows is fast, chaotic, eyes-closed combat: 
GRANT SYKES -GET OUT OF- 
-big BOOM of close-in shells. As Haytham throws it in reverse and punches, the front of the Rover shreds. The windshield bursts. Engine dies: tachometer and speedometer needles bottom out instantly. Haytham and Al-Ghazi tuck into the dash. Fleury tries to get as close to the backseat floor panels as possible. Janet covers Sykes. 
A Thump-Thump-Thump can be heard on the roof: A GRENADE thrown with too much arm by the guy Sykes spotted bounces off the roof and into the Land Cruiser. 
Frantic, Fleury swats it out. 
The blast releases a massive airburst and bits of shrapnel into the vehicle, starring windows, rocking it: creak of shocks and struts. Fleury lifts up now, grabs the M-4: returns fire indiscriminately through the windows at any and all surrounding rooftops. That provides cover and reminds everyone in the car they're armed. Janet exits with a rifle: firing out the back door, more covering fire. Civilians who were ready to see a massacre scurry now that it's a fight. 
129   EXT. ROOF TOP - NEXT MOMENT                               129 
A SHOOTER: black-hood, black T-shirt, old-school red-white- black Air Jordans, snub-stock AK, an open, filthy North Face backpack at his feet holding spare clips, God knows what else. 
Shots from below keep him two feet away from the ledge, firing down in random sweeps, head turned like he's lighting a fire-cracker. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   123. 
We see things from above, three stories down, a sweep of blindly-fired shells pop the asphalt inches from Fleury's head, soiling his face in black-top debris. But Fleury never stops firing back, his own head slightly turned, flinching on reflex. Air Jordan grabs another grenade just before he disintegrates: Fleury's three-feet away with the riot gun. Another rack and blast to make sure A.J. stays down for eternity. 
Fleury spots and bull-charges a second SHOOTER: Ballistic Chicken, Fleury wins. A sound... Fleury spins, racking the riot gun, aims and FREEZES: 2 six year old BOYS stare from the doorway. 
130   EXT. SUWEIDI STREET - NEXT MOMENT                           130 
Haytham crouches in front of the Land Cruiser. Rocks thrown now from somewhere: KIDS peeking from behind shacks Palestinian-style. He's pelted in the side of the head. 
Janet and Sykes move to a stopped vehicle and take cover. 
From the rooftop, Fleury yells down to the men on the ground. 
FLEURY (O.C.) I CAN SEE THE MERCEDES... BLOOD- TRAILS RIGHT UP TO AN APARTMENT IN THE NEXT BUILDING- 
131   EXT. ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT                                 131 
Fleury's P.O.V.: an Apartment complex that looks like a roadside motel: exposed stairwells, walkways, entrances. A puddle in front of one of the front doors on the third floor. Then we look right, one street over: civilian FIGURES, some in traditional dress, starting to mass. 
FLEURY MOB FORMING NEXT BLOCK! 
He drops the riot gun, picks up the AK from the man he just killed, pops a new clip from the backpack, slings the backpack over her shoulders. Starts to hustle down. 
132   INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - SAME MOMENT                             132 
Gunshots reverberating from outside. Echoes. The 32 year-old, hands shaking with nerves, screwing the camera into the tri- pod: set-up almost complete. The Passport Officer is posted at the door: head poking out, weapon up and ready. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   124. 
We can hear Arabic yells down what sounds like a hallway. Passport Officer barks something back. 
The Driver of the Trail Suburban squats, pinning Leavitt's head down with his knee, knife near a long, white expanse of neck. The Huge Man sits on Leavitt's stomach, keeping him in place. Leavitt trying to gasp for breath: eyes-wide panic. 
DRIVER READY? 
Just as the 32 year-old nods yes, Leavitt explodes with his last bit of effort: kicks just enough to nudge the Camera, trying to knock it over. The 32 year-old gets his hands on it as it falls, almost catches it, slips out, smacks the ground, battery pops off. The Driver and Huge Man both begin hammering Adam. 
PASSPORT OFFICER (O.C.) (in Arabic) GOD DAMN HIM! 
32 year-old picks the camera up again, trying to re-attach the battery as Adam fights for his life. Spit and claws and snot and blood rage. 
133   EXT. CINDER-BLOCK APARTMENTS - NEXT MOMENT                  133 
Running down side stairs, Fleury spots a grenade launcher poking from a door, next-door to the apartment with blood- pool in front. 
RONALD FLEURY RPG! 
Empties his clip into that vicinity: windows shatter, wood splinters. The grenade launcher recedes. Janet and Al-Ghazi start to run. The launcher fires from its new position...The trail suburban DETONATES. Al-Ghazi and Janet knocked flat on their asses for second and third times: dazed. 
Fleury searching: I know that Fuck with the RPG is reloading, how do I kill him. Drops the bag off his shoulders, pulls a grenade out, fires it as hard as he can: 40 yards on the fly. Bounces just on the third floor landing- 
134   INT. ENEMY APARTMENT - SAME MOMENT                          134 
-RPG Soldier just locking the new rocket tube in, brings the reticle up to his eye. Grenade blast splits through what's left of the front window. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   125. 
Big flinch-tense on his part: rocket fires inside, roars down the hall, hits two feet in-front of the door Passport Officer has been peaking out of. 
Massive, contained detonation.   Passport Officer vanishes. The 32 year-old and his camera are   blown through the Driver waiting to saw Leavitt's neck.   Because Leavitt was held so tight to the floor, he escapes   the worst of the blast. Still fucked up. 
Leavitt's P.O.V.: ears roar with the ring, no sounds. 32 year- old and Driver lay in a heap on the floor. Huge Man's on his back, trying to get up. Leavitt breathes, rolls to the Driver and the boy: grabs driver's blade. Hand to hand war as Leavitt gets his payback. He does not stop. 
135   EXT. CINDER-BLOCK APARTMENTS - SAME MOMENT                  135 
Sykes takes cover between two cars, holding down the rear, firing warning shots and screaming football plays to freak out the LOCALS. 
SYKES THIRTY EIGHT RAZOR MAD DOG!!! 
He fires above the crowd, as Janet heads into the building. Two LITTLE KIDS slowly approach carrying water, obviously terrified at the sight of the wounded American. 
Sirens and helicopters sound in the distance. 
136   EXT./INT. CINDER-BLOCK APARTMENTS - NEXT MOMENT.            136 
Little One trembles. One of the women in the corner calls to her in Arabic, sharp. Janet just strokes the back of her little bloody fist. Her little hand opens, shaking: this is a gift for you. 
Janet's face ghost white: Little One is trying to give her a marble... 
Al-Ghazi steps closer, sees the marble. Processes things. Immediately looks over at the huddled mass: THE GRANDFATHER staring right back at him. We now see the old man clearly. Al- Ghazi shaking, slowly steps to him, hands out... 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) (in Arabic) Let me help you up, Old Man... 
The old man nods a `no.' 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) (in Arabic) GIVE ME YOUR HANDS! 
Al-Ghazi rips Grandfather up now. The family screams. Al- Ghazi pulls the old man's hands from under his thobe: missing fingers. Bends at the knees to look the Old Man right in his eyes, lifts his chin with his hand. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) (dazed, starting to realize) ...Hamza. 
The old man looks up at Al-Ghazi: rage and defiance. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) I got you. Abu Hamza, you are under arrest. 
ABU HAMZA stares, hatred burning into Al-Ghazi. 
NASSAR You are a traitor to your country... a traitor to your God. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI I am no traitor to my God. You are. 
Al-Ghazi's chest explodes before we hear the booms: the 15 year-old Grandson, firing a cheap, nickel-plated 9MM. Everybody drops. The family huddles that much closer to the floor. Al-Ghazi falls back to the floor, pulling Grandfather with him. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   130. 
Fleury's standing stock still, out-of-body now: He can only see a teenager built like a river-reed, like his own Son... not a Murderer who just shot his friend. Quiet-sick: 
RONALD FLEURY ...Don't... 
The 15 year-old steps to the doorway, pulls the trigger again: the cheap 9MM jams. Janet lifts up with her AK, aims it at the boy's chest. 
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) ...drop it, Son...please... 
...The teenager wiping his tears: so he can see clear enough to clear his jammed weapon. Half young boy, the other half something much more dangerous...Expert movements from his hands, racking back the slide, thumbing the still smoking shell from the ejector, letting the slide go, racking another round into the chamber. 
Then... Fleury finally pulls his trigger. 
Utter Distortion as the old man reaches for the teenager's fallen hand gun. Janet, screaming, raises her gun towards the old man as Al-Ghazi shoots the old man in the chest. Sobbing, the little boy runs to his fallen grandfather. Janet, still screaming, covers the family. The Grandfather whispers something we cannot hear in the Little Boy's ear. 
TIGHT ON HAYTHAM taking it all in: the bleeding, dying teenager; his hysterical sister; Hamza choking, clutching for his grandson. CHAOS, CONFUSION, CONFLICT swirling in Haytham's eyes. 
A platoon of SAUDI POLICE slowly enter the room. 
Janet goes to the shot 15 year old, starts trying to stop the bleeding... 
Fleury reaching for the dying Al-Ghazi, cradling him. Tears spill as his eyes move from the dying boy to the old man, back down to Al-Ghazi. 
Fleury grasps Al-Ghazi's hand, as a Saudi man would. 
RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) You got him. You got him... You got him.

143    EXT. PRINCE SULTAN AIRBASE - LATER                        143 
Our crew watch from a deserted terminal as a C-130 touches down. 
Haytham enters: came to say good-bye. The team's first smiles -- collective. Fleury stares at Haytham...thinks about what he's seen the past few days...how he has come to admire this Kid. Haytham smiling, bandaged himself. Halting and awkward, he shakes Janet's hand. 
HAYTHAM (in Arabic) Thank you. 
JANET MAYES Thank you, Lieutenant Haytham. 
Haytham says good bye to Leavitt and Sykes. Comes to Fleury. Hands him a beautiful wooden prayer bead necklace. 
HAYTHAM May peace be with you. 
FLEURY May peace be with all of us,   my friend. 
The two men shake hands.

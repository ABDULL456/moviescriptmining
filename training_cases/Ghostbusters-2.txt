Ghostbusters II 
by Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd 
September 29, 1988 Last revised Feburary 27, 1989 
EXT.  MANHATTAN ISLAND - DAY 
A high AERIAL SHOT of the island features the Statue of Liberty prominently in the foreground then TRAVELS ACROSS the harbor, OVER the Battery and Lower Manhattan to Greenwich Village. 
EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - DAY 
A car is being hoisted up by a municipal tow truck while its owner is having a terrible screaming arguement with a parking enforcement officer. DANA BARRETT comes home pushing a baby buggy, struggling with two full bags of groceries, and trying to dig her keys out of her purse. The 
building superintendent FRANK, sees her struggling but pretends not to notice. 
DANA (exasperated) Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags? 
FRANK I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent. 
DANA You're also a human being, Frank. 
FRANK (reluctantly going to help) Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her. 
DANA (setting the wheel brakes on the buggy) Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually. 
She continues digging in her purse while Frank leans over the buggy and makes funny faces at the baby, OSCAR, a very cute nine-month old boy. 
FRANK (to the baby) Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger? 
FRANK (to Dana) That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett. 
DANA (finding her keys) Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week. 
FRANK Didn't I do it? 
BABY BUGGY 
It starts to vibrate as if shaken by an unseen hand. 
EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY 
He GURGLES with delight at the movement. 
EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - DANA AND FRANK - DAY 
Neither of them notice the movement of the carriage. 
DANA No, you didn't, Frank. 
FRANK Okay, that's no problem. 
DANA That's exactly what you said last week. 
BUGGY WHEELS 
The brakes unlock themselves. 
DANA 
She reaches for the handlebar of the buggy, but the buggy rolls forward just out of her reach and stops.  Surprised by the movement, she reaches for the handlebar again, but this time the buggy rolls away even further.  Alarmed now, Dana hurries after it, but the buggy keeps rolling down the street at ever increasing speed. 
SIDEWALK 
Dana chases the buggy down the street, shouting to passing pedestrians for help, but every time someone reaches out to stop it, the buggy swerves and continues unchecked. 
INTERSECTION 
Cars, trucks, and buses speed by in both directions as the buggy races toward the corner. 
DANA 
She puts her head down and sprints after the buggy like an Olympian. 
EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY 
A city bus is on a collision course with the speeding baby buggy. 
BUGGY 
Winston switches on a tiny TAPE RECORDER which starts PLAYING the Ghostbusters THEME SONG. Stantz and WInston start singing 
STANTZ AND WINSTON 'There's something wrong in the neighborhood. Who you gonna call?' 
KIDS (all together) He-Man!! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WEST 77TH STREET - DAY (LATER) 
Stantz and Winston wearily load their equipment into the Ectomobile. 
WINSTON That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds. 
STANTZ Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season. 
They get in the car 
INT.  ECTO-1 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION) 
Stantz tries to start the car, but the engine won't turn over. 
WINSTON Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are. 
STANTZ (tries to start the car again) Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city. 
WINSTON Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise. 
STANTZ Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow. 
He turns the key again, the ENGING TURNS OVER, then starts GRINDING and CLUNKING disastrously, chewing up vital parts and dropping twisted bits of metal onto the pavement.  Finally, with a BLAST of black sooty exhaust from the tailpipe, Ecto-1 shudders and dies.  Frustrated, Stantz bangs his head lightly on the steering wheel 
CUT TO: 
INT.  WKRR-TV STUDIO RECEPTION AREA - DAY (LATER) 
A bank of monitors in the lobby show the program now running on WKRR, Channel 10 in New York. We PUSH IN ON one of the monitors as a title card and logo come up accompanied by some EERIE SYNTHESIZER MUSIC, and we return to the show in progress: "World of the Psychic with Dr. Peter Venkman."  There is a video dissolve to a standard talk show set and sitting there is our host PETER VENKMAN, the renowned and somewhat infamous ex-Ghostbuster. 
VENKMAN 
He turns TO CAMERA and talks to his viewers in a suavely engaging tone, understated and intimate. 
VENKMAN Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund. (to his guest) Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it? 
MILTON Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger. 
VENKMAN Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book? 
MILTON I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve. 
VENKMAN This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe. 
MILTON (irritated) This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve. 
VENKMAN (placating) Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind? 
The CAMERA REVEALS ELAINE, an attractive, aggressive New Jersey housewife, sitting on the other side of Venkman. 
ELAINE According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016. 
VENKMAN Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine? 
ELAINE I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world. 
VENKMAN Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn? 
ELAINE It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter. 
VENKMAN (humoring her) No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time. (does his wrap-up right TO the CAMERA) Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets. (holds up a hairless cat) Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ... (puts a finger to his temple and sends out a though to his viewers) ... Good night. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TV STUDIO - CORRIDOR - DAY (LATER) 
Venkman comes out of the studio squabbling with his producer, NORMAN, a well-meaning young incompetent. 
VENKMAN Where do you find these people?  I thought we were having the telekinetic guy who bends the spoons? 
NORMAN A lot of the better psychics won't come on the show.  They think you're too skeptical. 
VENKMAN You mean like the time you got possessed and turned into a monster terror dog?  No, not a chance.  Total coincidence. (to Stantz and Spengler) Am I right? 
Stantz and Spengler look at him skeptically, not convinced by the coincidence theory. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - LATE AFTERNOON 
The museum has just closed for the day and the last of the visitors and employees are leaving. 
INT.  RESTORATION STUDIO - SAME TIME 
Janosz is working late on the painting of Vigo. 
VIGO PAINTING 
Unnoticed by Janosz, the eyes of Vigo start to glow. 
JANOSZ 
He touches his brush to the canvas and a powerful current of red, crackling energy surges through the brush and courses through his body, driving him to his knees. 
PAINTING 
The figure of Vigo comes to life, turns toward Janosz and gestures dramatically at him.  Then he speaks to Janosz in a commanding voice. 
VIGO I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you. 
JANOSZ (in agony) Command me, lord. 
VIGO On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again. 
Bolts of red-hot energy shoot from the eyes of Vigo into Janosz's eyes. He screams and falls to his knees. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COFFEE SHOP - EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT 
Venkman and Stantz come out with small boxes containing coffee, sandwiches and Danish and start walking up the street. 
VENKMAN I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one. 
STANTZ Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting. 
VENKMAN Relax.  We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile. 
EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) 
Spengler, wearing a hardhat, is JACKHAMMERING a hole in the middle of the street.  Safety cones and reflectors have been set up and a small area is lit by strong work lights. 
POLICE CAR 
It turns onto East 77th Street, cruises slowly up to the makeshift worksite and stops.  The noise of the JACKHAMMER is so loud, Spengler doesn't notice the police car and the two COPS inside looking at them. Finally, he looks up, sees the police car and freezes. 
FIRST COP How ya doing? 
SPENGLER (reeking with guilt) Fine!  It's cutting fine now. 
FIRST COP (curious) Why are you cutting? 
SPENGLER (looking for one of the others) Why are we cutting?  Uh - boss! 
Venkman and Stantz arrive just in time wearing Con Ed hardhats, doing a good imitation of a Consolidated Edison repairman. 
FIRST COP What are you doing here? 
VENKMAN (belligerent) What the hell's it look like we're doing? We're bustin out asses over here 'cause some douchebag downtown ain't got nothin' better to do than make idiots like us work late on a Friday night, right? (looks to Spengler for agreement) 
SPENGLER (with a "right on" fist) Yo. 
The cops seem satisfied by the explanation. 
FIRST COP Okay, boys, take it easy. 
They drive off.  Spengler breathes a great sigh of relief and starts rubbing his sore shoulders. 
SPENGLER You were supposed to help me with this. 
VENKMAN You need the exercise. 
EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) 
Venkman and Spengler start hauling in the cable as a Con Ed Supervisor's car drives up, and behind it, the same police car they saw earlier.  A burly SUPERVISOR gets out and crosses toward them, followed by the two cops. 
SUPERVISOR (no nonsense) Okay, what's the story here? 
Venkman and Spengler stop pulling up the cable and Venkman tries the belligerent worker ploy again, only this time he's wearing a Nynex hardhat. 
VENKMAN What, I got time for this?  We got three thousand phones out in the Village and about eight million miles of cable to check. 
SUPERVISOR (not buying it) The phone lines are over there. (points to the curb) 
Venkman pops Spengler on the head. 
VENKMAN I told ya! 
Stantz can be heard ranting over Venkman's walkie-talkie. 
STANTZ (O.S.) (filtered) Help!  Help!  Pull me up!  It's alive!  It's eating my boots. 
Venkman switches off the walkie-talkie. 
FIRST COP You ain't with Con Ed or the phone company. We checked.  Tell me another one. 
Venkman stares at the Cop for a long moment. 
VENKMAN Gas leak? 
INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - SAME TIME 
Stantz is hanging there, looking down into the shaft at the slime which is now bubbling up the shaft after him. 
STANTZ (shouting) Get me out of here!! 
Desperate now, he kicks wildly and knocks loose a section of an old, rusting conduit. 
INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT 
The conduit falls on a heavy electrical transmission line, ripping through the cable with a SHOWER OF SPARKS. 
EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Venkman, Spengler, the cops and the supervisor all react to a bright FLASH deep down in the hole and a SHOUT from Stantz. 
EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - STREET - NIGHT 
One by one, all the streetlights go out; then the lights on all the buildings along East 77th street; then the whole neighborhood blacks out, and finally the entire city is plunged into darkness. 
STANTZ (O.S.) Sorry. 
INT. DANA BARRETT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 
She walks around in the dark lighting candles and placing them all over the living room.  Then she finds a transistor radio and turns it on for information about the blackout.  She listens to a special news report for a moment, then has a compelling impulse to go check on the baby. She crosses to the nursery carrying a candle and quietly opens the door and looks in.  Suddenly the DOORBELL RINGS, scaring her half to death. Leaving the chain on the door, she opens it a crack and sees Janosz standing in the hall, eerily lit by a red emergency spot at the end of the hallway.  He looks slightly dazed and even creepier. 
DANA (surprised) Janosz? 
JANOSZ Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right? 
His affected concern is chilling.  She is frightened but conceals it from him. 
DANA (mechanically and cautiously) We're fine, Janosz. 
He tires to look around her into the apartment. 
JANOSZ Do you need anything?  You want me to come in? 
DANA No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway. 
JANOSZ Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you. 
DANA Good night, Janosz. 
She closes the door behind him and double locks it, then stands there staring into the candlelight, alone and afraid. 
INT.  HALLWAY OF DANA'S BUILDING - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) 
Janosz stands there in semi-darkness, then his eyes light up like headlights and he walks off down the hall. 
CUT TO: 
PROSECUTOR Do you know what this equipment is used for? 
CON ED (shrugs) I don't know.  Catching ghosts, I guess. 
PROSECUTOR (to the Judge) May I remind the court that the defendants are under a judicial restraining order that specifically forbids them from performing services as paranormal investigators and eliminators. 
JUDGE So noted. 
PROSECUTOR Now, Mr. Fianella, can you identify the substance in the jar on the table marked Exhibit F? 
PROSECUTOR 
She goes to the exhibit table and picks up a specimen jar containing the slime sample Stantz removed from the tunnel. 
CON ED I been working underground for Con Ed for 27 years and I never saw anything like that in my life.  We checked out that tunnel the next day and we didn't find nothing.  If it was down there, they must have put it there. 
DEFENSE TABLE 
Venkman and Spengler look at Stantz. 
STANTZ (defensively) Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there. 
SPENGLER It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source. 
LOUIS (nervously) Should I say that? 
SPENGLER I doubt that they'd believe us. 
Louis moans and goes back to his notes. 
WIPE TO: 
INT.  COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - LATER 
Venkman himself is on the stand and Louis is questioning him. 
LOUIS So like you were just trying to help out your old friend because she was scared and you didn't really mean to do anything bad and you really love the city and won't ever do anything like this again, right? 
PROSECUTOR Objection, your Honor.  He's leading the witness. 
JUDGE The witness is leading him.  Sustained. 
LOUIS Okay, let me rephrase that question. (to venkman) Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children? 
VENKMAN Yes, I did.  We were city champs. 
PROSECUTOR Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial. 
JUDGE Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case? 
LOUIS (to Venkman) Do I? 
VENKMAN No, I think you've helped them enough already. 
LOUIS (to the Judge) No, I guess not. (to the Prosecutor) Your witness. 
The Prosecutor rises and approaches the witness stand with relish. 
PROSECUTOR So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street. 
VENKMAN Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice. 
The gallery laughs and the Judge gavels for order. 
JUDGE Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt. 
VENKMAN Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist. 
PROSECUTOR I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath. 
VENKMAN I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in. 
PROSECUTOR So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province? 
VENKMAN No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it. 
The spectators in the gallery cheer and the judge gavels for order. 
WIPE TO: 
Holding his gavel like a pitiful weapon, he crawls over to the defense table where Venkman, Stantz and Spengler are now crouched, assessing the spectral intruders. 
JUDGE (terrified) You've got to do something! 
VENKMAN Who are they? 
JUDGE They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me. 
VENKMAN Maybe they just want to appeal. 
SCOLERI BROTHERS 
They break loose from the electric chairs, then turn toward the defense table and BLAST it with HIGH-VOLTAGE FINGER-LIGHTNING. 
PROSECUTOR 
She sprints for the door, pursued by one of the Scoleri brothers. 
GHOSTBUSTERS 
They jump to safety behind the rail of the jury box, pulling the Judge with them. 
VENKMAN These boys aren't playing around. 
JUDGE (desperately) You've got to stop them.  Please! 
LOUIS (thinking like a lawyer) Violating a judicial restraining order could expose my clients to serious criminal penalties.  As their attorney I'd have to advise them against it. 
SCOLERI BROTHERS 
They start punching through the jury box. 
JUDGE 
He is just about hysterical with fear. 
JUDGE All right!  All right!  I'm recinding the order.  Case dismissed!! (he pounds his gavel on the floor) Now do something! 
STANTZ Let's go to work, boys. 
With that, the Ghostbusters leap over the rail of the jury box and dash across the courtroom to the exhibit table where their proton packs were being displayed as evidence.  They strap them on hastily as the Brothers continue tearing up the seats looing for the Judge. 
VENKMAN (slinging the pack onto his back) Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are. 
STANTZ (grabbing other gear) Okay, let's heat 'em up! 
They flip the power switches on their packs and draw their particle throwers. 
STANTZ All right, throwers.  Set for full neutronas on stream. 
They switch on their throwers and turn to face the raging phantasms. 
SCOLERI BROTHERS 
They are just about to wipe out the Judge when a loud shout distracts them. 
VENKMAN Hey!  Why don't you pick on someone your own size? 
The towering ghosts turn in a fury and raise their arms, ready to shoot lightning at their new adversaries. 
STANTZ (to the others) On my signal, boys.  Open 'em up -- Now! 
They all pull their triggers and the wands EXPLODE with incredible powerful STREAMS OF ENERGY, doing even more damage to the courtroom. 
VENKMAN Spengs, take the door.  Ray, let's try and work them down and into the corner. 
Working as a team, they gradually confine the Scoleri Brothers with the streams, forcing them closer and closer to the traps Ray has set out on the floor. 
STANTZ Watch it!  I'm coming under you, Pete. 
They circle around the two ghosts, prodding them with the streams while ducking the lightning bolts shooting from their fingers.  Finally, Ray sees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids of light energy. 
STANTZ Steady -- watch your streams -- easy now -- Venky, bring him left -- Spengy, pull him down -- trapping -- trapping -- now! 
He stomps on a control pedal and the Scoleri Brothers are drawn into the traps which snap shut. 
INT.  COURTROOM - TRAPS - DAY 
LEDs on the outer casing start flashing, indicating the presence of a ghost inside each trap. 
STANTZ (TO CAMERA) So don't wait another minute.  Make your supernatural problem our supernatural problem. Call now, because we're still -- 
ALL (in unison, mechanically) -- Ready to believe you. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  JACK HARDEMEYER'S OFFICE - DAY 
Hardemeyer is watching the Ghostbusters commercial on a TV in his office. He bangs his fist on his desk and angrily switches OFF the TV. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY (LATER) 
The garage door opens and the new improved ECTOMOBILE comes ROARING out onto the street, its ghostly SIREN MOANING and WAILING.  Louis comes running out after it. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY 
Louis comes back into the garage bay and stops as he smells a foul odor. He sniffs around, following the smell. 
LOUIS Oh, geez, smells like somebody took a really big -- 
He freezes. 
INT. OFFICE AREA - LOUIS'S POV 
Slimer, a spud-like green ghost, is hovering over Louis's desk, scarfing down Louis's bag lunch.  Slimer looks up and sees Louis. 
SLIMER AND LOUIS 
They both scream and run off in opposite directions. 
SLIMER 
He passes right through a wall and disappears. 
LOUIS 
He runs right into a wall, recovers and exits in a hurry. 
LOUIS (screaming) Help!  There's a thing! 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - DAY (LATER) 
Runners of both sexes and all ages are huffing and puffing as they jog along the track that circles the reservoir.  One of the runners looks behind him at the sound of APPROACHING FOOTFALLS and screams. 
GHOSTLY JOGGER 
A ghost jogger is loping along at a pretty fair pace.  Other runners stumble and run screaming into the park as he passes them.  Seemingly oblivious to the effect he's having, the ghost jogger puts two fingers to his skeletal neck and checks his watch as if taking his pulse. 
EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - DAY (SAME TIME) 
Venkman is sitting on a park bench near the jogging track reading the newspaper, eating a donut and drinking coffee from a Styrofoam cup. 
STANTZ 
He's sitting on a bench opposite Venkman's, casually watching the jogging track. 
GHOST JOGGER 
He approaches the benches where the Ghostbusters are waiting.  As the ghost jogger passes the benches, Stantz and Venkman simultaneously hit concealed control buttons.  A ghost trap buried in the track throws up a glowing inverted pyramid and catches the ghost jogger in mid-stride. Stantz and Venkman close the trap and capture the ghost jogger. 
VENKMAN (checking his watch) You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes? 
STANTZ If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  JEWELRY STORE - DAY 
The Ghostbusters come out carrying smoking traps, wearing cheap dime-store Santa Claus hats. 
STANTZ (to the client) Merry Christmas! 
CUT TO: 
VENKMAN 
Unaware that he's being watched, Venkman squints at the still life, holding up his thumb like he's seen artists do. 
VENKMAN You know you can go to Art World and get these huge sofa-size paintings for about forty-five bucks. 
He starts looking around at the other artwork in the studio. 
DANA I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art. 
VENKMAN As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case. 
They are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Janosz. 
JANOSZ (smiling at Venkman) Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend? 
DANA Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha. 
Venkman warily shakes his hand, trying to size him up. 
JANOSZ (avoiding his gaze) Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television. 
VENKMAN How are you? (looking over at the Vigo painting) What's that you're working on, Johnny? 
Janosz winces at the nickname but lets it go.  Venkman and Dana cross to the Vigo painting.  Janosz steps protectively in front of it. 
JANOSZ It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century. 
VENKMAN (staring at the painting) Too bad for the Moldavians. 
JANOSZ (defensive) 
He was a very powerful magician.  A genius in many ways and quite a skilled painter. 
DANA He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage. 
VENKMAN Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs? (picking up a brush) A fluffy little white kitten in the corner. 
Venkman reaches toward the painting, but Janosz grabs his hand. 
JANOSZ (with forced good will) We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman. 
VENKMAN Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you. 
Dana looks disapprovingly at Venkman. 
VENKMAN (to Janosz) I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you. 
JANOSZ My pleasure. 
Venkman and Dana cross back to her workspace. 
VENKMAN (confidentially) I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy. 
DANA Good-bye, Peter. 
VENKMAN (dragging his feet) I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you. (calls out to Janosz) Later, Johnny! 
He exits. 
VIGO 
Vigo turns his head and follows Dana as she returns to her workbench. 
DANA 
She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the painting.  As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana turns suddenly and catches the movement.  Frightened now, she hastily leaves the studio. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  FIREHOUSE - LIVING QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY 
Venkman and Winston enter and find Stantz and Spengler at work in the lab area. 
STANTZ Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you. 
VENKMAN (to Spengler) It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it? 
Stantz goes to the refrigerator, opens the freezer, rummages around among the TV dinners and frozen pizza and pulls out a slime specimen in a Tupperware container. 
VENKMAN I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item. 
WINSTON Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand. 
VENKMAN So we'll put a warning on the label. 
Stantz turns OFF the MUSIC and the toaster stops moving.  Venkman looks at the toaster and sticks his fingers in the slot. 
VENKMAN (to the toaster) Go ahead.  I dare you. 
Suddenly, he yelps as if the toaster has actually bitten into his hand and won't let go.  The others jump in to help him, but Venkman laughs and easily withdraws his hand. 
VENKMAN Just kidding. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  DANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Dana brings Oscar into the bathroom and lays him on the bassinet.  She's wearing a robe over her nightgown, preparing to bathe the baby.  She turns the taps on the old claw-footed bathtub, checks the water temperature, then turns away and starts to undress the baby. 
DANA (talking sweetly to the baby) Look at you.  I think we got more food on your shirt than we got in your mouth. 
BATHTUB 
The water pouring from the faucet changes to slime and settles at the bottom of the tub.  Dana reaches over and turns off the water without looking into the tub.  When she turns away, both taps start to spin by themselves and the tub flexes and bulges. 
DANA 
Still unaware, she routinely reaches over and squirts some bubble bath into the tub. 
BATHTUB 
The rim of the tub puckers up and the sides convulse as if swallowing the bubble bath. 
DANA She picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub. She is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to close up around the baby like a hugh mouth.  Dana screams, snatches the baby away and runs from the room clutching Oscar to her bosom as the bathtub convulses and vomits up buckets of slime.

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - SAME NIGHT (LATER) 
The big open loft space is a chaotic clutter of mismatched furniture, old magazines, books, tapes, and sports equipment.  Venkman is asleep on the floor, still wearing his coat, scarf, hat and gloves, having collapsed just short of the bedroom.  The DOORBELL RINGS, he wakes up, lumbers to his feet and answers it.  He opens the door and sees Dana standing there. She is wearing only a nightgown under her coat and Oscar is naked, wrapped in a baby blanket. 
DANA (somewhat embarrassed to be there) I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out? 
VENKMAN (surprised to see her) No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in. (noting her apparel) Are we having a pajama party? 
DANA (upset) Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar. 
Venkman looks at her for a long moment. 
VENKMAN You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised. 
DANA I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me. 
VENKMAN Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown? 
DANA (distraught) I don't know what to do anymore. 
VENKMAN I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here. 
He exits to the bathroom.  She looks around the loft, amazed at the disorder.  Venkman comes back immediately with an old sweatshirt and takes Oscar from her. 
VENKMAN Now this kid has a serious nudity problem. 
He spreads the sweatshirt out on the sofa, lays the baby on it and starts tying it around him like a diaper. 
VENKMAN (to the baby) This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it. 
DANA Peter, what about the bathtub? 
VENKMAN (grabs the phone and dials) We'll take care of that. (on the phone) Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid. 
DANA It was full of this awful pink ooze. 
VENKMAN (to Ray) Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right.  They're here now ... Right ... Let me know. 
He hangs up. 
VENKMAN They're going over there right now.  You might as well make yourself at home.  Let me show you around. (he crosses to the kitchen area) This is the cuisine de maison -- 
INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 
Janosz is working on the Vigo painting when the Ghostbusters enter.  He rushes over and stops them at the door. 
JANOSZ Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here. 
VENKMAN I know. 
JANOSZ Then why have you come? 
VENKMAN We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first. 
STANTZ (to Spengler and Winston) Let's sweep it, boys. 
They deploy and start scanning the studio with their monitoring devices. 
VENKMAN (to Janosz) You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny? 
JANOSZ (nervous) The Upper West Side. 
SPENGLER (consulting his PKE meter) This entire room is extremely hot, Peter. 
JANOSZ What exactly are you looking for, Dr. Venkman? 
VENKMAN We'll know when we find it.  You just sit tight.  This won't take long. 
STANTZ 
Using the Giga-meter, he traces a strong psychomagnetheric reading to the painting of Vigo in the alcove at the end of the studio.  Venkman comes up behind him with Janosz right on his heels. 
VENKMAN This is the one that looked at Dana. 
JANOSZ It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things -- 
VENKMAN (interrupts) I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory.  If she says it looked at her, it looked at her. (to Vigo) Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking to you. 
They watch the painting for any sign of movement. 
VIGO 
His eyes stare lifelessly into the distance. 
STANTZ AND VENKMAN 
Venkman starts shooting Polaroids of Vigo. 
VENKMAN (to Vigo) Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it. (to Stantz) Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here. 
STANTZ I'll get one more reading. 
Venkman walks off leaving Stantz alone with the painting.  Stantz scans the painting with the Giga-meter until his eyes meet Vigo's. 
VIGO 
His eyes seems to burn right through to the depths of Stantz's soul. 
STANTZ 
He stands there transfixed, unable to look away, as a strange and subtle transformation occurs within him.  Winston comes up behind him and breaks the spell. 
WINSTON (looking at the painting) Now that's one ugly dude. 
STANTZ (coming back to his senses) Huh?  What? 
WINSTON You finished here? 
STANTZ (distracted) What?  Yeah. 
WINSTON Are you all right?  You coming down with something? 
STANTZ No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go. 
They head for the door. 
JANOSZ 
He escorts the Ghostbusters to the door. 
JANOSZ So you see, everything is in order, is it not? 
VENKMAN (confidentially, to Spengler) Watch him, Egon.  Don't even let him shave. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - DAY (LATER) 
There's a KNOCK at the front door, a key turns in the lock, and Venkman enters somewhat tentatively holding a bouquet of flowers and a small suitcase of Dana's. 
VENKMAN (calls out) I'm home! 
He looks around the large open loft. 
VENKMAN (to himself) I knew it.  She cleaned. 
He hears the SHOWER RUNNING and crosses to the bathroom.  The door is half-open and he can see Dana in the shower (tastefully blurred) through the transparent vinyl curtain.  He closes the bathroom door and looks at the baby asleep on the bed, surrounded by pillows to prevent him rolling off.  Then he turns and bumps into Dana who's just coming out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel.  She jumps back into the bathroom. 
She comes out again, this time wearing a robe. 
VENKMAN Are you all squeaky clean now? 
DANA (humoring him) Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment? 
She squeezes past him into the bedroom and closes the door. 
VENKMAN (through the door) Nothing.  They stayed there all night, went through your personal stuff, made a bunch of long-distance phone calls and cleaned out your refrigerator.  And didn't find anything. 
Dana opens the bedroom door. 
DANA They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now? 
VENKMAN Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it. 
DANA I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know. 
VENKMAN It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees. 
DANA Does she know anything about babies? 
VENKMAN Janine Melnitz, are you kidding? (handing her the flowers) Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities. 
DANA Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner. 
She smiles and closes the door again.  He opens the closet and starts looking for his good suit. 
VENKMAN Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here? 
DANA (O.S.) I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty. 
VENKMAN (shaking his head) I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty. 
He pulls some clothes out of the hamper and inspects them. 
VENKMAN These aren't so bad yet.  You just hang them up for a while and they're fine. 
CUT TO: INT.  FIREHOUSE - RECEPTION AREA - EARLY EVENING 
Janine covers her computer terminal and starts turning out the lights. Then she notices that the lights are still on upstairs.  She starts primping and freshening up her makeup. 
INT.  FIREHOUSE - LAB AREA - SAME TIME 
Louis is strapping on a proton pack, preparing to deal with Slimer once and for all.  He's wearing a bicyclist's rearview mirror on a headband. 
LOUIS (to himself) Okay, Stinky, this is it.  Showdown time. You and me, pal.  You think you're smarter than I am?  We'll see about that. (loud) Oh, hello, Pizza Man!  Oh, two larges!  I only ordered one.  Oh, pepperoni and pineapple.  My absolute favorite.  I guess I'll have to eat these both by myself. 
THE CEILING 
Slimer pokes his head through the ceiling and scans the room hanging upside down. 
LOUIS 
He spots Slimer through the rearview mirror. 
LOUIS (quietly) Okay, let's boogie! 
He whirls around and fires a proton stream at Slimer, slicing a burning a gash across the ceiling. 
THE STAIRS 
Janine comes up and ducks as a bolt of energy streaks across the room and strikes the wall behind her.  Slimer disappears. 
STANTZ That's it.  It's on the bottom. 
SPENGLER Nine feet -- ten -- 
WINSTON Is the line sinking? 
SPENGLER No, the slime is rising. 
Stantz looks down and notices the slime rising over the edge of the platform and around his boots. 
STANTZ (alarmed) Let's get out of here, boys. 
He starts to pull out the plumb line but it seems to be stuck. 
Spengler tries to help, but whatever is pulling on the cord is stronger than all three of them.  As their unseen adversary pulls them closer and closer to the edge, Stantz works desperately to unhook the cord from his belt but finally just unhooks the whole belt.  Spengler lets go in time but Winston doesn't.  He is jerked off his feet and into the slime flow. Stantz and Spengler look at each other, summon their courage and jump in after him. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  ARMAND RESTAURANT - NIGHT (LATER) 
Dana and Venkman are sitting at a table in an elegant restaurant nibbling caviar and toasting with very expensive champagne. 
VENKMAN (very intimate) Here's to -- us. 
She sighs and drinks. 
VENKMAN So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions? 
DANA I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me. 
VENKMAN Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe? 
DANA For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real? 
VENKMAN All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me? 
DANA Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know. 
VENKMAN I'm not even good for me. 
DANA Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know. 
VENKMAN Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century. 
DANA (already feeling the effects of the champagne) So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000? 
VENKMAN Let me jingle you right now. 
He leans over to kiss her. 
DANA Maybe I should call Janine. 
VENKMAN Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children. 
They kiss. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 
Janine is on the sofa doing her nails while Louis paces with the baby. 
JANINE (looking around) I can't believe a person could actually live like this. 
LOUIS (to the baby) So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them. 
JANINE It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch. 
LOUIS (continuing) So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired. 
Louis goes into the bedroom and puts the baby down. 
JANINE You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell. (as he returns) Why don't you come here and sit with me? 
LOUIS Okay. 
He sits stiffly beside her on the sofa. 
JANINE (getting close) Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you? 
Stantz suddenly realizes how ridiculous they look. 
STANTZ (self-conscious) Uh -- well -- we had a little accident, but forget that.  We have to see the mayor as soon as possible. 
COP Look, Doc, why don't you just go home. You'll get a good night's sleep and then you can give the mayor a call in the morning. Come on. 
He takes Stantz by the arm but Stantz resists. 
STANTZ We're not going anywhere with you.  I told you we have to see the mayor now. 
COP (grabbing Stantz) I'm warning you.  You can come along peaceably or -- 
VENKMAN (grabs the Cop) Hey, don't be an idiot.  This is serious. 
COP (angry) Look, pal, keep this up and you're going with them. 
VENKMAN Oh, yeah? 
COP (has had enough) Yeah, let's go.  You're all under arrest. 
The Cop catches Venkman in an armlock and starts walking him out of the restaurant. 
VENKMAN (to Dana) Finish your dessert -- it's already paid for.  I'll call you. 
They all exit, causing a major commotion among the other diners. 
EXT.  ARMAND'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) 
The police car is parked right behind Ecto-2.  Spengler stops at the police car and confronts the cops. 
SPENGLER Look, we're not drunk and we're not crazy. This is a matter of vital importance. 
Venkman steps in and looks at the policemen's nametags. 
COP What are you doing? 
VENKMAN I just want to get your names right for when the mayor asks us why we didn't let him know about this sooner. 
The Cops look at each other, uncertain about what to do. 
COP (relenting) Okay, Doc.  You want to see the mayor, you got it.  Follow us. 
They head for their respective vehicles.

Louis and Janine are on the sofa making out when Dana enters.  They jump up and start smoothing their clothes. 
LOUIS (embarrassed) Oh, hello, Dana.  we were just -- we were -- 
DANA I know what you were doing, Louis.  It's all right. 
JANINE How was your date? 
DANA Typical.  Peter was arrested.  Has he called? 
LOUIS No, nobody called. 
Dana frowns. 
DANA Is everything all right with Oscar? 
JANINE Oh, he's fine.  He's such a good baby.  He was a little fussy at first, but we gave him a Freach bread pizza and he went right to sleep. 
DANA (relieved) Oh, good.  I'll just check on him. 
She crosses to the bedroom.

Hardemeyer shakes his hand and exits as the door slams shut on the Ghostbusters. 
INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 
Louis and Janine are watching an old rerun on TV, eating popcorn, while Dana is stretched out on the other sofa. 
DANA (wishing they'd leave) You know you really don't have to stay. Peter should be back soon. 
LOUIS Oh no, we don't mind. 
She hears a little CRY from the nursery and sits up. 
DANA Excuse me.  I think Oscar is up. 
She crosses to the bedroom. 
INT.  VENKMAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION) 
Dana enters and immediately notices that the crib is empty and the window is open. 
DANA (screams) Louis! 
Frantic now, Dana rushes to the window and looks out, as Louis and Janine come running in. 
EXT.  WINDOW LEDGE - DANA'S POV - NIGHT (ECLIPSE) 
The baby is standing out on the ledge at the corner of the building, fifty feet above the street, staring off into the distance as if he's waiting for something. 
EXT.  WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT (ECLIPSE) (CONTINUOUS ACTION) 
Dana climbs out onto the ledge and starts inching slowly toward the baby. Then she stops as a miraculous apparition materializes. 
LOUIS AND JANINE 
They lean out the window, gaping at the apparition. 
EXT.  VENKMAN'S LEDGE - APPARITION 
A sweet, kindly-looking English nanny appears, pushing a pram, strolling on thin air parallel to the ledge high above the ground.  Her face looks remarkably like Janosz Poha's.  The nanny extends her hand to the BABY who GURGLES sweetly as he reaches out to take it. 
DANA 
She watches in helpless horror. 
DANA (screams) No!! 
GHOST NANNY 
She picks up the baby and lays it gently in the pram, then turns and smiles at Dana.  The smile turns to a hideous grin, then the nanny shrieks at Dana and takes off like a shot with the baby. 
DANA 
She watches the creature fly off with Oscar, then climbs back through the window assisted by Louis and Janine. 
DANA (resolutely) Louis, you have to find Peter and tell him what happened. 
LOUIS (confused and worried) Where're you going? 
DANA To get my baby back. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  MUSEUM - NIGHT (A LITTLE LATER) 
A taxi pulls up, Dana jumps out and rushes into the museum.  The moment the door closes behind her, there is a loud THUNDERCLAP, the ground trembles and a massive amount of slime erupts from around the base of the museum and starts covering the walls, sealing her inside the building. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  PARKVIEW PSYCHIATRIC - PADDED ROOM - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 
Venkman, Stantz, Spengler and Winston are in a padded cell.  They are handcuffed and the cuffs are chained to thick leather belts around their waists.  Venkman stands there banging his head into the padded wall while the others try to explain the situation to a skeptical Psychiatrist. 
STANTZ We think the spirit of Vigo the Carpathian is alive in a painting at the Manhattan Museum. 
PSYCHIATRIST I see. And are there any other paintings in the museum with bad spirits in them? 
SPENGLER (impatient) You're wasting valuable time!  We have reason to believe that Vigo is drawing strength from a psychomagnetheric slime flow that's been collecting under the city. 
PSYCHIATRIST Yes, tell me about the slime. 
LOUIS Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you. 
SHERMAN Like what? 
LOUIS I got you out of those bad tax shelters. 
SHERMAN You were the one who got me in. 
LOUIS I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she? 
SHERMAN Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble. 
LOUIS I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm. 
SHERMAN Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff. 
Sherman looks out the window.

With the Plaza Hotel in the background, the fountain starts to spout psycho-reactive slime. 
HOTEL ENTRANCE 
A well-heeled MAN and WOMAN step out of a limousine and walk up the steps toward the revolving door.  She looks up at the sky and frowns. 
WOMAN (shrewish) I told you we should have stayed in Palm Beach.  The weather here gets stranger every year. 
MAN Yes, dear. 
She doesn't notice it, but a small amount of slime falls on the back of her luxurious, full-length, white mink coat.  The doorman nods courteously and extends a hand to help her up the stairs. 
WOMAN 
She yelps in pain. 
WOMAN (to the doorman) Something just bit me! 
The doorman looks curiously at her, then recoils in shock as her coat comes alive.  MINK HEADS pop out of the thick fur, SNARLING, BARKING and YAPPING, their sharp, little teeth biting the air.  Reacting quickly, the doorman yanks the coat off the woman's back, throws it to the ground and starts stomping on it as the Woman and her husband look on in horror. The coat scuttles down the steps and runs off down the street.

DETECTIVE TWO (on another phone) Was this a big dinosaur or a little dinosaur? ... Oh, just the skeleton, huh?  Well, where is it now? 
DETECTIVE THREE (on the phone) Wait a second -- the park bench was chasing you?  You mean, someone was chasing you in the park ... No, the bench itself was chasing you.  I see -- 
A weary SERGEANT answers a RINGING PHONE. 
SERGEANT Manhattan Central, Flaherty speaking ... Yeah ... yeah? ... What?  Who is this? ... Wait a second. 
He puts the caller on "Hold" and turns the LIEUTENANT. 
SERGEANT Lieutenant, I think you better talk to this guy. 
LIEUTENANT (on another call) What is it?  I'm talkin' here!

WINSTON How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim. 
VENKMAN It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card. 
SPENGLER With a water temperature of forty degrees we'd survive approximately fifteen minutes. 
Stantz studies a maritime navigational chart. 
STANTZ I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th. 
VENKMAN Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.

Janosz is sitting next to Dana, still wheedling her with promises and self-serving logic. 
JANOSZ Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship. 
DANA We don't have a relationship. 
JANOSZ I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking. 
DANA I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child. 
JANOSZ Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it. 
DANA I'd rather not.

The avenue has been closed to traffic and barricades placed, blocking all the side streets.  A squadron of police motorcycles comes speeding around the corner at 72nd Street and proceeds up Fifth Avenue in the direction of the museum.  Then MUSIC is heard BOOMING in the distance, the ground shakes and the Statue of Liberty comes walking around the corner onto Fifth Avenue followed by a wildly cheering throng. 
CUT TO: 
VIGO 
He is now almost completely out of the painting, but still held from the knees down.  He spits and rages at the Ghostbusters, trying to unleash his magic powers. 
THE GHOSTBUSTERS 
They stand fast, secure in the knowledge that Vigo's power has been neutralized by the good will of the people. 
STANTZ Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey. 
VENKMAN The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know. 
WINSTON (arming his slime-blower) Say goodnight now. 
Suddenly Vigo grabs Stantz by the neck and holds him up as a shield. 
SPENGLER Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray! 
STANTZ (strangling) Do it!  Just do it! 
Winston fires and hoses both Vigo and Ray. 
VIGO 
He bellows and drops Ray, then falls back into the painting.

The paint turns liquid, melts off the canvas and runs onto the floor revealing another painting underneath it.

Venkman, Spengler and Winston rush over to Ray and kneel beside him.  He is completely covered with slime and motionless. 
SPENGLER (examining him) He's breathing. 
Winston wipes the slime off Ray's face and Ray opens his eyes. 
WINSTON Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man? 
STANTZ (smiles lovingly) Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life. 
VENKMAN Oh, no.  We've got to live with this? 
They pull him to his feet. 
STANTZ I love you guys.  You're the best friends I've ever had. 
He hugs them each in turn, leaving them slimed as well.  Venkman recoils in disgust. 
VENKMAN Hey, I just had this suit cleaned. (indicating Janosz) Take care of the wiggler, will you. 
Venkman crosses to Dana who is snuggling the baby.  She hugs Venkman. 
VENKMAN What is this -- a love in? (notes the symbols painted on the baby's body) Hey, sailor.  I think the tattoos are a little much, don't you? 
He picks up the baby. 
DANA (to Venkman) I think he likes you.  I think I do too. 
VENKMAN Finally came to your senses, huh? 
They hug and kiss. 
SPENGLER, WINSTON AND STANTZ 
They help Janosz to his feet.  He's dazed but unhurt. 
JANOSZ (restored to normalcy) What happened? 
STANTZ (calmly) Sir, you had a violent, prolonged, transformative psychic episode.  But it's over now.  Want a coffee? 
JANOSZ (extremely nice) That's very kind of you. 
SPENGLER (to Stantz) He's fine, Ray.  Physically intact, psychomagnetherically neutral. 
JANOSZ Is that good? 
WINSTON It's where you want to be.

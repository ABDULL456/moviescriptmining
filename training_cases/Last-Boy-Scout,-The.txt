You wanna be a detective? Here's what you do: Take a trusted friend, and imagine the worst thing, the most despicable thing, the thing it would never even cross their minds to do. Then assume they've already done it twice. Joseph R. Hallenbeck Private Investigator 
When you consider that a career in pro foot- ball means maybe ten years, after which you got no legs left, and during which you're a painkiller drug addict, a million a year sounds about right. So when people bitch at me about the money I made, I have a pat response: Go fuck yourself. James Alexander Dix Former quarterback, L.A. Stallions 
THE LAST BOY SCOUT 
FADE IN: 
INT. DARK BEDROOM The only light, that of a flickering TV screen. A big MAN lies, shirtless, on the bed. Watching a sports program. We hear: SPORTS FIGURE (V.O.) (on TV) Eliminating the draft? Worst thing ever happened to pro football. Already you got Eric Dickerson, no team's good enough for him... You got Dion Sanders, this guy, Bosworth, bunch of peacocks. Nagurski, I saw him play for 25 bucks a game. And he woulda played for free, you get me? He loved the game. Nowadays? Forget about it. The TELEPHONE SHRILLS in the stillness. The Man On the Bed answers it. Speaks haltingly. MAN ON BED Hello...? MALE (V.O.) Hello, Billy.    Do you know who this is? Silence. 
MALE (V.O.) Kid from Ohio is looking real good, Billie... The Man's hand unclenches. A container of pills spills over the blanket. He stammers: MAN ON BED I'm... I'm gonna... try real hard... MALE (V.O.) No, Billy. What you're gonna do ... is rush for 150 yards against Chicago. MAN ON BED That's... too much. I can't... (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MALE (V.O.) You can. And you  will. This is a business, Billy.  You don't make one fifty, you're history, the kid steps in. No more  job... and no more pills, Billy. MAN ON BED Please... Just give me time... MALE (V.O.) One hundred and fifty yards. Goodbye. The PHONE CLICKS off. NFL running back Billy Cole stares straight ahead, mouth working spastically. CUT TO: 
AERIAL SHOT - SNOWSTORM OVER Chicago, Illinois, as the CAMERA SPIRALS DOWN TOWARD a teeming football stadium. We hear crowd noise and marching band music, deafeningly loud, as we SUPERIMPOSE the legend: SOLDIER FIELD, CHICAGO   NOVEMBER 14 
INT. ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH The BROADCAST TEAM huddles inside the quilted jackets, squinting through the snow. Speaking into headset mikes. ANNOUNCER Good afternoon and welcome to Soldier Field, Chicago, site of today's confrontation between the L.A. Stallions and the Chicago Bears. This is Vern Lindquist with Terry Bradshaw, and, yes, my friends, it is that cold. 
ANOTHER ANGLE Hallenbeck snores. The mashed squirrel perches on his chest. A shadow falls across him as -- 
KIDS return, scratching their heads.   Staring in at him. KID #2 Goddamn.   Dude's trashed. KID #3 Take his bottle. Kid #1 smiles nervously.   Reaches in with infinite patience. Trembling hand inches closer and closer -- And closes on the bottle as, without warning -- 
HALLENBECK sits bolt upright and grabs the Kid and stuffs a .38 revolver in the Kid's face and cocks it. HALLENBECK Hey, motherfucker. The Kid, of course, shrieks. And the light of sanity dawns in Hallenbeck's eyes. He sucks in a deep breath. Releases the struggling Kid. Swears under his breath. Watches    the boys flee in terror. Notices a dead squirrel    in his lap. Scowls. Heaves it out the window. Pumps    a Camel into his mouth. Lights it. Rescues the bottle of    Seagrams. 
Thus begins his morning. He opens the car door. The sprinkler douses him. He gets out. Stands on the lawn. One of the Kids, the toughest one, is standing on the sidewalk. KID #3 I'm not scared. Hallenbeck scowls. HALLENBECK You're on my property, kid. KID #3 Sidewalk belongs to the government. Hallenbeck stares at him.   Smiles weakly. 
HALLENBECK Excuse me. He leans over and vomits on the lawn. One hand gripping the car fender. The sprinkler goes round and round. 
EXT. MALIBU BEACH FRONT - MORNING A redwood beach house, mellow in the morning sun. There was a party here last night. Banners. Balloons and streamers. Tawdry in the light of day. 
INT. BEACH HOUSE - SAME TIME A plush bedroom.   Sun streams in the window. A YOUNG MAN sits, straddling a backwards chair.     Bare- foot, bare-chested. Blond hair, perfect tan. He is nursing a beer.   Smoking and staring at -- 
BED where a tawny golden girl lies, serene and innocent. Like a sleeping kitten. Rumpled sheets, one breast exposed. No tan line. The man takes a drag off the cigarette, studies the sleeping girl. Meet Jimmy Dix. Twenty-seven years old, former National League heartthrob. He shakes his head and mutters: JIMMY (YOUNG MAN) Jesus, kid, if only you weren't so damn ugly. He gets up and goes into the head. Pulls out a glass vial. Dips a coke spoon with practiced ease. Sucks it up a nostril. For one moment, he catches his own eye in the mirror. FLASH CUT TO: 
FLASHBACK - FOOTBALL FIELD Seventy thousand people screaming. Jimmy in the middle. Younger Jimmy.    Fresher Jimmy. It's a night game at the Coliseum.   He's the quarterback. The snap. Jimmy fakes the draw. Rolls right.      Around him, all is impact. Sound and fury. He targets a receiver and unleashes a rocket.   Sixty- yard toss, hits the guy between the numbers. 
JIMMY'S FACE Covered with dirt and mud. Blood, too. Young and proud. Seventy thousand voices tell him he's alive. He makes a difference. 
BACK TO PRESENT Alone in the bathroom... leaning on the counter.    Head down. A voice calls softly from the bedroom: SLEEPY VOICE (O.S.) Jimmy, are you still here...? Pause, then: JIMMY I don't know. He looks up at his reflection. Glazed eyes, beard stubble. Crows' feet around the eyes. JIMMY Yeah.    I guess I am. He sniffs, clearing his nose. 
INT. WEST L.A. BUNGALOW - MORNING Hallenbeck opens the door and shambles in. Dark. Depressing. Sprawl of furniture. Stack after stack of sports magazines. Drop all your belongings out of a plane. They will land like this. He flicks on the light. Crosses to the couch and flops down. Plucks a bottle of aspirin from an end table. Next to the bottle, we see -- 
TWO FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS side by side. In one, younger Hallenbeck is kissing younger bride. Smiling. In the other, the President of the United States presents Hallenbeck with a medal. They are both smiling beneath the Presidential Seal. 
JIMMY Get out of here. Go. She goes. He leans over and grabs Ray by the hair. The guy is bleeding. Delirious. Jimmy yanks until their faces are inches apart. JIMMY Best arm in the National League, you son of a bitch. Remember that. He lets go. Ray sags, semi-conscious. The poker players come running as Jimmy walks back inside. 
EXT. COAST HIGHWAY - DAY Jimmy gets into the car. Takes out his vial. Spoons some powder, sucks it up. A voice in the background: "Hey, someone shit on my car!" 
EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY Joe Hallenbeck slides his Plymouth to the curb in front of a cozy stucco dwelling. Gets out, crosses the lawn. A fat NEIGHBOR is watering shrubs next door. He waves. NEIGHBOR 'Morning, Joe, how's it going? HALLENBECK My ears are burning, Andy. Even as we speak, someone, somewhere is calling me an asshole. NEIGHBOR You're funny. HALLENBECK I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th. 
INT. HALLENBECK'S HOUSE - SAME TIME Hallenbeck enters and crosses the living room. A woman, forty-ish, once beautiful, appears in the bedroom doorway. Wearing a terry cloth robe. This is Joe's wife SARAH. SARAH I thought you were in Las Vegas. HALLENBECK I was. SARAH Where did you sleep? HALLENBECK Office. He brushes past her and crosses to the bed.   On the pillow, a big stuffed cat toy smiles benignly. HALLENBECK Hey, Furry Tom. He sits on the bed. Lights a cigarette. Opens the night stand and removes a speedloader for his .38. Starts to load the gun. SARAH How much did you lose? HALLENBECK I wasn't there to gamble.    I was doing a skip trace. SARAH How much did you lose? 
HALLENBECK Fifty bucks. He suddenly notices a sheet of paper on the night stand. A crayon sketch. He picks it up, frowns: HALLENBECK What's this? SARAH Darian's class drew holiday pictures. That was hers. Her teacher wants to see us, Joe. 
CLOSE ON DRAWING It's a picture   of Santa Claus,  except this Santa has long, stringy hair,   bloodshot eyes,  and grotesque talons. A little girl's   severed head is  clutched in one hand. Underneath, in   block capitals,  is written: SATAN CLAUS. 
BACK TO SCENE HALLENBECK Satan Claus. Kid's got some talent, don't you think? SARAH It's hideous. 
Her voice is ice cold.    Joe turns and regards her levelly. HALLENBECK You okay, Sarah...? SARAH I'm tense. I couldn't get to sleep last night. HALLENBECK Hmmmm. Well, I think the kid will be fine. Boys still tease her about the headgear? SARAH Are you kidding? Brace Face, that's the latest. Little bastards. HALLENBECK (under his breath) She'll be fucking them by the time she's fourteen. SARAH Watch your Goddamn mouth, Joe. HALLENBECK Well, Christ, you let her wear enough makeup. The kid looks like a goddamn raccoon. She comes in late at night, I think, 'Christ, a burglar.' I almost shot her twice. SARAH You're not funny. All the girls at that school wear makeup. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Yeah, but they don't apply it with a paint sprayer. And for your information, our neighbors think I'm very funny. SARAH Go live with them. HALLENBECK Don't tempt me. He tosses the holstered .38 on the bed.   Stalks into the bathroom. 
INT. BATHROOM HALLENBECK Damn raccoon. He sighs, tosses his cigarette butt in the toilet. Walks back out into the bedroom. 
INT. BEDROOM He kneels, looks under the bed. Frowns. Straightens and says, very conversationally: HALLENBECK Who's the guy in the closet? Sarah stops dead.   Spins and stares at him. 
SARAH Excuse me? HALLENBECK (frowns) Oh, that's right, you sometimes forget that I'm a detective. (lights a cigarette) See, first I noticed how tense you were, but I let that pass. Then I noticed there was steam in the shower like someone was just in there, but meanwhile your hair is completely dry, you follow? So. Why the steamy shower? (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLENBECK (CONT'D) Because someone else was in there, right, and since he's not under the bed you must have stuck him in the closet when you heard my key in the door a day early. Tah-dah. Please, no applause. A silence hangs between them.    Sarah just stares.   Shakes her head. SARAH Well, nothing changes.    You're still a lunatic. 
OFF TO ONE SIDE a UNIFORM COP questions Hallenbeck and Sarah, who stand stiffly. Not looking at each other. UNIFORM COP Why did Mr. Miller visit your home this morning, Mr. Hallenbeck? Joe lies easily: (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLENBECK He came by to talk business. He had a case he was to busy to continue with, a routine surveillance. He farmed it out to me. UNIFORM COP I see.    Is that all you talked about? HALLENBECK Yeah.    That's all. He looks the Officer in the eye.      Betrays nothing. 
CUT TO: 
NAKED, GYRATING BODY Female, for the record.   Signaling us that we are now: 
INT. "BOTTOMLESS PIT" CLUB - NIGHT Rowdy strip club in   West Hollywood. Just like the      name suggests; if it's a   virus, you're sitting on it.      After three drinks, every   girl on stage looks like your     high school sweetheart.    Was your sweetheart fat? Did      she have excessive body   hair? FUNK MUSIC, played LOUD. The Monday crowd stomps and claps. Onstage a stripper grinds away with an enthusiasm usually reserved for standing in line at the DMV. Jimmy Dix sits at the bar, hooting and whistling. Behind the bar, a black man in a wheelchair serves drinks. His name is HARP. Off to one side, a twenty-five-year-old BEANPOLE speaks into a microphone: EMCEE (BEANPOLE) Flash of green buys a flash of pink, gentlemen. So reach into your pockets if you aren't there already, and reward the lovely and talented Ms. Vixen...! The black man shakes his head. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HARP My son. He writes his own material, he's proud of that. Some people are proud, they cured leukemia. Old guy stops beating off long enough to laugh, my son thinks he's Eddie Murphy. Jimmy uncaps a beer and raises it in a toast. JIMMY Alex the astronaut. Harp raises his own glass. 
HARP Alex the astronaut. It seems to be a common ritual between them. Jimmy drinks, thumps the bottle down. Says, resolutely: JIMMY I've had it, Harp. HARP Had what? JIMMY It, man. I've had it. (takes a swig) I don't remember what I did  last night. I'm an idiot, Harp,   I act like a complete dickhead.   I don't have friends. I drink too   much. I fuck anything that's warm  and breathing. 
HARP Stay on that side of the bar. JIMMY (sighs) I cheated on my girl friend again. HARP You cheated on her?   You must be crazy. JIMMY Maybe so, Harp. Maybe so. His gaze wanders across the crowded room, fixating on -- 
SCANTILY-CLAD WAITRESS Who makes her way between the tables. She is beautiful. Stands out like a teamster at a gay rights rally. Supple body. Deep green eyes. Flaxen hair. Her name is CORY. She stops at a table against the wall. Puts down a Seagrams V.O. in a rocks glass. Seated at the table is a broad-shouldered man in a bad suit. The essence of boredom. Looks like he's been there three days. A cloud of smoke hangs around his head. Mr. Joe Hallenbeck, no less. HALLENBECK The police won't help you, huh? CORY Sure. After I'm dead they'll perform the autopsy. HALLENBECK Guess you don't want to wait that long. CORY Guess not. HALLENBECK (scowls) They only play this kind of music? CORY What did you expect? HALLENBECK Pat Boone?   The Four Freshmen? CORY What are you, my father? HALLENBECK Yes, I'm your father. Get your clothes on. (beat) I hate this funk shit. It's gonna be an extra hundred bucks. CORY You're hilarious.      Sit next to the speaker, you'll     get used to it. After a while      you'll be screaming play that     funky music white boy. HALLENBECK The screaming part I believe. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: She smiles and moves away. Hallenbeck sips his drink.      Scans the crowd with shrewd eyes. 
ANOTHER ANGLE The lovely Cory approaches Jimmy at the bar.     Harp looks on. CORY (seductive) Hello, handsome. How'd you like to buy me a bottle of champagne? 
JIMMY How much for a bottle? CORY Forty dollars. JIMMY No thanks. Nothing personal, my seventh grade teacher was killed by a drunk driver. CORY Tall guy?   Sandy hair? JIMMY That's the one. CORY I had to swerve three times to get him. 
JIMMY Ha-ha. CORY So no bottle, then? JIMMY For forty bucks I'd rather drink my own piss. CORY That's extra. And with that, she leans over and moulds her lips to his. Time passes. These two know each other, it would seem. Cory pulls away. Jimmy smiles. JIMMY Hi, Cory.   Rough night? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Her eyes go wide with shock. The Hitmen burst from their car.    OPEN UP on full auto. Cory is cut down. Blown backward over the hood of her Ford. Flung to the street. JIMMY Oh Gooood!! And without missing a beat, the Hitmen turn -- And OPEN FIRE on Jimmy. He takes a running start. Clears the hood of his Jag in a single leap. BULLETS DICE the metal behind him. 
He lands, hard.   Sucks the ground.    Huddled behind his car, as: 
TWO HITMEN move toward him, triggering THREE SHOT BURSTS. The kid is dead meat. Or so it seems until, without warning -- 
JOE HALLENBECK charges into the intersection.     Screaming bloody murder. He's got a GUN in each fist, and both are BLAZING. One Hitman dies immediately: Dances like a puppet, racked by gunfire. Bullets go through him. SHATTER the sedan's WINDSHIELD. 
The second Hitman turns and OPENS UP on Hallenbeck. Too late. Joe rolls behind a mailbox. BULLETS chase him, blowing apart the metal box. The Hitman swears. Turns, running for the sedan. He knows when a getaway is in order. Just one problem.     He forgot about Jimmy Dix. A SCREECH of TIRES. As Jimmy's Jag slews around the corner, laying rubber. Rockets toward the Hitman, pins him in its headlights -- The Hitman screams as Jimmy plows through him -- And CRUNCHES into the gray sedan. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Shatters the Hitman between the two cars... And holy Christ, the guy's still alive. Pinned like a butterfly, legs broken... He raises his rifle, screaming. Jimmy dives flat on the front seat.    The WINDSHIELD ERUPTS. The Hitman.   Still pinned.   Still screaming. He FIRES SHOT AFTER SHOT into Jimmy's car. Hallenbeck walks up behind him. Puts a BULLET in his head. He stops screaming. 
JIMMY is still huddled on the front seat in a sea of broken glass. Hallenbeck walks up, leans in the window. HALLENBECK Hey. (as Jimmy looks up) Back up. 
ANOTHER ANGLE Jimmy puts it in reverse. The car backs up. Steam pouring from the crumpled hood. The Hitman, now freed, collapses to the street. Like a sack of flour. 
Hallenbeck limps toward him, wheezing. He stops as: 
MOTEL MANAGER stands outside a door marked OFFICE. Holding a pump action shotgun leveled at Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck nods at the bodies in the street. HALLENBECK It's all over, compadre. MANAGER Get off my property, mister. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLENBECK (scowls) Sidewalk belongs to the government. He turns and looks at Jimmy. The kid is in pain. Staring at Cory's bullet-riddled body. Eyes glazed. Hallenbeck says nothing. He crosses to the shattered Hitman. Kneels  down, fishes through the guy's coat pockets. Comes  up with a bloody pack of cigarettes. Extracts one.  Lights it. SIRENS fill the air. And Jimmy snaps out of it long enough to reach into his coat -- Takes out the vial of coke. Ditches it. Drops it down a sewer grating, out of sight. No one sees him do it. 
POLICE CRUISERS come SQUEALING up, flashers turning. Surrounding Jimmy, who stands, head down and motionless -- And Joe, who smokes and looks at the moon. CUT TO: 
INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT SERGEANT BENJAMIN BESSALO sits behind his desk, scanning a stack of typed pages. A tired-looking cop named McCASKEY lounges in the doorway. A Christmas tree in the corner sheds needles. 
PATROLMAN Got it. Peanuts Morton. Used to sell hash in Crenshaw District. JIMMY No, man. I played football. Jimmy Dix, L.A. Stallions. PATROLMAN What position? JIMMY Forget it. PATROLMAN Fuckin' football. Free agents ruined the damn game. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He walks away.   Jimmy scowls.    Grumbles to himself. HALLENBECK We gotta cross the parking lot. You wanna borrow my sunglasses? JIMMY Fuck you. HALLENBECK Hey, snappy comeback. You a detective? As the two cross the muster room toward the front doors, they pass the hooker we saw earlier. She is talking to her pimp. There is a heated exchange.     The pimp slaps her.   Hard. Suddenly, Jimmy lunges forward.     Balling his fists. JIMMY That son of a bitch! He's ready to clean the pimp's clock when Hallenbeck grabs him, spins him bodily. Propels him out the front doors. Away from trouble. 
EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT HALLENBECK What the fuck are you trying to do, Tarzan? 
JIMMY He hit the chick. HALLENBECK You don't start a fight in a police station, dickhead. Are you really this stupid or did you take lessons? JIMMY Guy shouldn't treat a woman like that, is all I'm saying. He just shouldn't, okay? HALLENBECK Why? Because they're weak and need protecting? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JIMMY (pause, then) Yeah. He's serious. Hallenbeck starts to chuckle. Shakes his head, lights a cigarette. Laughs through the smoke. This may be the funniest thing he's ever heard. CUT TO: 
EXT. POLICE IMPOUND LOT - SAME TIME Hallenbeck walks across the parking lot toward his car. Jimmy trots behind him. 
JIMMY Mind if I catch a ride with you? HALLENBECK Yes. JIMMY My car's fucked up, remember? HALLENBECK Take the bus. JIMMY Cut it out. Look, you sorta saved my life. Let me buy you a beer. HALLENBECK I'm not thirsty. Good night. He approaches his battered Plymouth.    Jimmy scowls. 
JIMMY That's it.     Good night? HALLENBECK Go home.     Get some sleep. JIMMY What are you gonna do? HALLENBECK I'm gonna get a message to the people who killed your friend. JIMMY What's the message? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLENBECK That we're out of it. That whatever they're doing, they don't have to worry about us. JIMMY You're kidding. Joe gets in the car.   Says nothing. JIMMY You're backing off, you're not gonna do anything? I watch T.V., what the fuck kind of private eye doesn't do anything? 
HALLENBECK The kind with a wife and kid. Look, it's over. My job is done. JIMMY Fuck you your job is done.    We witnessed a murder, Joe! HALLENBECK Yes, it was very exciting. Tomorow I'll take you to the zoo. (beat) You wanna play hero, go ahead. When you die, I'll take your closet full of eighty-dollar shirts. JIMMY Look, until this is over, I'm sticking with you. 
HALLENBECK The hell you are. JIMMY I'm part of this. We do something, we do it together. HALLENBECK Have a ncie night. He STARTS the CAR. JIMMY Don't drive away, Joe. Joe puts it in gear.   Pulls away. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JIMMY Joe -- !     I'll tell the cops, Joe. Joe taps the brake.    Stops.   Leans out the window, says softly: HALLENBECK Tell them what, Jimmy? JIMMY That Mike Miller was fucking your wife. (beat) Only reason you're not in the cooler, tough guy, is the cops got no motive for Miller's death. When they find out Mikey was dickin' your old lady, seems to me you become suspect numero uno. I'm scared, and I'm coming with you, got it? Joe gets out of the car and advances on Jimmy. HALLENBECK You little creep, I'm gonna beat the shit out of you. JIMMY Go for it. Then the cops'll really love my story. (smiles) You don't start a fight in a police station, dickhead. HALLENBECK You and me is not a fight.     You and me is a massacre. JIMMY Gosh, you're tough. HALLENBECK Get in the fucking car. 
INT. CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT Hallenbeck is in a foul mood. Jimmy lights a cigarette and applies for a position as pep chairman: JIMMY You got any hobbies? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Swears softly as he sees two thin copper wires, glinting in the moonlight. HALLENBECK They used a car bomb on Mike, it figures they'd try it on her, too. (stands) Except they wired the wrong car. Jimmy pales noticeably. JIMMY Oh.   Shit.    Oh. Jeez. Hallenbeck claps him on the back. 
HALLENBECK Easy, kid. No harm, no foul.     We caught it in time. He strolls toward his Plymouth, whistling. Cheerfully unaffected. Jimmy catches his breath. Swallows hard. Turns, and bumps into Hallenbeck, coming back the other way. JIMMY What are you doing? Hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire-cutters. HALLENBECK Gotta disconnect the fucker. JIMMY Whoa. Hold on. Um, shouldn't we call the bomb squad or something? HALLENBECK (smiles) Relax, Junior, I used to do this for a living. He isolates one wire.    Turns and offers the cutters to Jimmy. HALLENBECK You wanna do it? JIMMY No, man, I -- (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Come on, chickenshit. Just snip the wire. Jimmy hesitates, then takes the cutters. Reaches beneath the wheel well. Plucks at the wire tentatively. Cuts. HALLENBECK Oh, shit not that one! Jimmy screams and stumbles backward. Lands on his ass. Hallenbeck is chuckling softly. Shakes his head as he walks around to release the hood. JIMMY You're a fucking asshole! HALLENBECK And then some, Junior. And then some. TIME CUT TO: 
THREE STICKS OF DYNAMITE - ONE MINUTE LATER have been taped to the car's ignition system. Hallenbeck removes the taped bundle. Holds it up for inspection. HALLENBECK We'll hand this over to the cops. They can analyze it. JIMMY Great.   So what now? 
HALLENBECK (shrugs) You tell me, kid. JIMMY Give up?     Flee? Go really far away? HALLENBECK I got a better idea. Let's check in with my family. They start walking toward Hallenbeck's Plymouth. Hallenbeck tosses the car keys to Jimmy. HALLENBECK I'm tired.    You drive. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JIMMY Sure.   Family, huh?   You got kids? HALLENBECK Yeah.   Little girl. JIMMY Does she like you? HALLENBECK Not much, no. And she likes Prince, so go figure. JIMMY I like Prince. 
HALLENBECK Great, you can marry my daughter. Or better yet, fuck my wife. I hear all it takes is a credit card and two valid I.D.'s. (beat) Open the trunk. JIMMY (indicating bomb) You're just gonna stick that in your trunk? HALLENBECK (nods) You're right. Let's leave it here for the neighborhood kids to play with. Jimmy opens the trunk. As he does, however, a voice rings out suddenly from the darkness. VOICE (O.S.) Hold it right there, gentlemen. They stop.   Slowly they turn. 
TWO MEN are approaching from out of the trees. One holds a flashlight trained on Hallenbeck and Jimmy. The other carries a silenced Beretta. JIMMY Is it the cops? HALLENBECK No, Jimmy.   It's not the cops. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Working quickly, Hallenbeck tapes the bomb to the inside of the truck lid. Slams it shut. Turns, facing the new arrivals. The MEN wear tailored suits with matching ties. One is tall and lean. The other is a bruiser, short and stout. They both have the seasoned look of professional mob hitters. The Taller Man speaks, gun held rock steady. TALL MAN Good evening, gentlemen. Bit late for a stroll, don't you think? 
HALLENBECK Yeah, you two better be getting home. JIMMY The streetlights are on. TALL MAN That's amusing. How delightful to find such amusing men so late at night. (beat) I don't believe I've had the pleasure. HALLENBECK No, I don't believe you have. (to Jimmy) He'd like to have the pleasure. JIMMY Tell him it's not for sale. HALLENBECK He says it's -- SHORT MAN What's your name, fuckface? This from the Shorter Man, who is clearly not happy. HALLENBECK (shakes his head) I'm asshole. He's fuckface. TALL MAN Jake, apprise Rodney Dangerfield here of his situation. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Jake slips on a pair of brass knuckles. Steps up and delivers a looping right to Hallenbeck's face. A sickening crunch. A two inch gash streams blood. Jake relieves Hallenbeck of his gun. TALL MAN Perhaps we can dispense with the fun and games now, yes? Jimmy rushes forward, snarling. The Beretta swivels. Jimmy stops, the gun aimed at his gut. HALLENBECK (gasping) Easy... Jim... All they want is the evidence... TALL MAN The evidence. Very smart. See, Jake, he knows when a situation is untenable. (smiles) You like that word? HALLENBECK Great word. TALL MAN It occurs to me that you may have the evidence in question. HALLENBECK (spits out blood) Give up, Jimmy. We're dealing with geniuses. 
Another fist to the head.   Hallenbeck grunts.   Spits more blood. JIMMY Leave him alone, you fuck! HALLENBECK Back off, Jimmy. The Tall Man turns and eyes Jimmy. TALL MAN Leave him alone...? (shrugs) Whatever you say. Jake? The Short Man steps away from Hallenbeck. Turns and launches a kick at Jimmy's groin. Connects. The kid drops to the ground, retching. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: TALL MAN (sighs) Ah, my young friend... I neglected to tell you that Jake attacks his job with a certain... exuberance. JIMMY Christ... I'm being beat up by the inventor of Scrabble. TALL MAN He's still in a good mood, Jake. Kick him again. Jake steps forward. 
INT. L.A.P.D. ROBBERY/HOMICIDE DIVISION - NIGHT Sergeant Benjamin Bessalo is in the mood to kick things. A metal trashcan is booted across the room with a clang as he whirls, glaring at Joe Hallenbeck, who is seated before him. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: BESSALO Goddammit, this is a police matter, you son of a bitch! I'm sick and fucking tired of sweeping up your dead bodies, Joe, and the next time I see your ugly mug I'm puttin' a bullet in it. You got that? You are off the case, buddy. Is that clear? Hallenbeck stares at him.   Blows smoke.    Says nothing. CUT TO: INT. RENTAL CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT 
Jimmy's at the wheel of a rented Subaru. Hallenbeck beside him. He hands Joe the envelope he found in Cory's apartment. JIMMY If you thought there was dynamite in the trunk, wait'll you see this. Hallenbeck reaches into the envelope and extracts a photograph: Two men having lunch together on a secluded patio. Both are older, distinguished-looking. Joe suddenly looks very pale. JIMMY The guy on the left is Connie Marcon, the owner of the L.A. Stallions. 
HALLENBECK Forget about him. Look at the guy on the right. JIMMY Sort of familiar. Who is he? HALLENBECK Senator Calvin Baynard. Jimmy draws a sharp breath.   Pause, then: JIMMY Let's go back to the cops.   I'm scared. HALLENBECK Take it easy, kid. It's not so bad. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JIMMY Not so bad. Excuse me, did you just say the words not so bad? You don't understand, Joe, see, if a guy vomits on the sidewalk, you don't say, 'Oh, hey, it's not so bad, there's some ham in there.' It's fucking vomit, okay? This is bad. Hallenbeck nervously lights a cigarette. Stares straight ahead through the windshield.   Begins to talk: HALLENBECK When I was thirty, I was on the President's personal security force. Once night I was on the way home from a late session. I'm on the highway just outside of Georgetown when I see something up ahead. 
MEMORY FLASH Another time. Another night. A younger-looking Hallenbeck. Rugged features. Clipped military haircut. He is driving. Down a turnpike, squinting through dense evening mist. Up ahead, a shape materializes out of the fog: 
WRECKED CAR is lying upside down in a pool of shattered glass. He SCREECHES to a stop. 
ANOTHER ANGLE In a dream-like SLOW MOTION, he approaches the overturned car. There are two dead bodies inside. A woman. A little boy. In the window, a stuffed Garfield doll clings with suction cups to the remaining glass. The furry cat is splattered with blood. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLENBECK (V.O.) It was a high-speed collision. Both cars were totaled. The woman and the boy were dead. The driver of the other car wasn't. 
STAGGERING DRUNK is weaving toward Hallenbeck. Leaving behind his crumpled Mercedes. He wears an $800 suit. Tan Cordovan loafers.   Silk tie. DRUNK Fuckin' bitch... She got in front of me, man. Shit. My fuckin' car. Stupid bitch wrecked my car... He stumbles toward Hallenbeck, eyes attempting to focus. DRUNK Do you know who I am...? I'm Louis Baynard, my father is Calvin D. Baynard, man. Call my father, he'll take care of it. The man lurches to a stop in front of Hallenbeck. Clutching at Joe's lapels. Wheezing liquor fumes. He presses a hundred dollar bill into Joe's hand. DRUNK You'll tell 'em what happened, right...? Bitch swerved in front of me, man. Wrecked my fuckin' Mercedes. Right...? 
HALLENBECK (V.O.) I could smell bourbon on him, big time. He was  standing there, not a scratch on him. I went a little nuts. I hit  him. In SLOW MOTION, Hallenbeck backhands the rich drunk, with a head-snapping impact that bursts lips. Breaks teeth. We see the Drunk's head slowly strike the asphalt. A sickening concussion. HALLENBECK The blow was non-lethal. But when he fell, his head hit the pavement funny. Put him in a coma. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The younger Hallenbeck stands on the highway of eight years past, staring at the Drunk with fierce, blazing eyes as we -- SNAP BACK TO: 
JIMMY AND JOE - BACK TO PRESENT Driving. HALLENBECK Even when he came out of it, he was never right in the head. His dad fixed everything with the cops. The accident report disappeared. A week later the police found half a kilo of crack cocaine planted in my house. Acting on an anonymous tip. JIMMY The senator fucked your job. HALLENBECK And my pension. And my marriage. Only reason I'm still licensed to carry a gun, the man himself made a few calls. Since then I'm just playing it out. Day by day. Jimmy is silent for a moment.   Then: JIMMY Cory tumbled to some sort of deal between Marcon and the senator, and they had her killed. (beat) We gotta show this photo to the cops. HALLENBECK Not yet. I need more evidence. (beat) I want Baynard, Jimmy. I want to bring him down. I could use your help. JIMMY Why should I help you? HALLENBECK Because if Baynard takes a fall, so does Marcon. The man who kicked you out of professional football. 
HALLENBECK That's two. You wanna play this game? I love this game. DARIAN Just leave me alone. (to Jimmy) He thinks he's fuckin' Ward Cleaver. HALLENBECK All right, that's it. You wanna be a gutter mouth? You wanna sound like your mother, well that's terrific. Christ, all day long I don't take enough abuse, I gotta listen to shit from you! JIMMY Hey, Joe, take it easy... 
HALLENBECK Don't you tell me how to talk to my kid. DARIAN All I wanted was to go to a party, but Pop here thinks I'm out to get laid. HALLENBECK Go for it, kiddo. All the dirty words. Come on, shock me. Go ahead. DARIAN Sure thing, you dumb fuck-up. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLENBECK All right, I've had it. Go to your room. Or I will whip your behind. DARIAN You'd probably like it. Hallenbeck takes her by the arm and drags her out of the chair. Toward her room. HALLENBECK Goddammit, you are my daughter and you will respect me, got that? You got it? You don't ever call me a fuck-up. DARIAN Why shouldn't I, Mom calls you that all the time. That stops him.   He looks at her, stricken. HALLENBECK Your mother called me a fuck-up...? When? DARIAN On the phone to Uncle Jay. HALLENBECK Uncle Jay? Ohh, Christ, I'm a fuck-up, but Uncle Jay, now there's a real stand-up guy. Shit, the bastard cheats on his tax form, I'm surprised he hasn't done time! Why don't you ask your mother why Mister Wonderful isn't in jail for tax evasion? DARIAN (smiles) Because he doesn't fuck up. She goes into her room and shuts the door. Hallenbeck rubs his eyes. Leans against the wall, exhausted. JIMMY You know, for fifty bucks you could get a guy to pull out her fingernails with a pair of pliers. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLENBECK No. Anything that much fun, I'd want to do myself. JIMMY I think we could both use a drink. Hallenbeck   crosses to a cabinet, breaks out a bottle of Seagrams.    Swigs.  Hands it to Jimmy. As Jimmy drinks, he notices   a photo on the wall: Hallenbeck shaking hands with   George Bush. JIMMY That's you? 
HALLENBECK Yeah.    That's me. JIMMY You look like the dad on 'The Brady Bunch.' HALLENBECK Yeah, I was a regular Boy Scout. Joe starts to fix a sandwich.      Jimmy takes nips from the bottle. JIMMY So.    You gonna get a divorce? HALLENBECK Don't know. He bites into the sandwich.      Not really tasting it. 
JIMMY You don't like women much, do you, Joe? HALLENBECK (mouth full) Mike Miller wasn't the first time. Sarah has cheated on me before. Twice. I never told her I knew. At first, my opinion of women took a real dip, yeah. JIMMY And now? HALLENBECK Now I'm content if I like the guy she's fucking. This last one was my best friend. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JIMMY Horseshit, he was a scumbag private eye. HALLENBECK What am I, Jimmy? JIMMY He tried to get you killed. HALLENBECK Friends can't be perfect. (sighs) I wish the sky wasn't blue. I wish water wasn't wet. I wish I didn't still love my wife. He eats in silence.   Jimmy says: JIMMY You know what I did last night? HALLENBECK What? JIMMY I went to a party and shit on a car. HALLENBECK Damn.   You, too? JIMMY I'm a complete loser. Capital 'L.' All I ever wanted... was to be somebody's hero, you know it...? Now I mostly sit around. Watch T.V. Get laid. I'm a fucking slug, throw salt on me I'd curl up. Life sucks. HALLENBECK You're wrong. JIMMY Life doesn't suck? HALLENBECK No, life sucks. But you're not a loser. Cory loved you. JIMMY Yeah, and the last thing I did was cheat on her. (beat) Why do people cheat, Joe? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Because it's easier than paying the tax, Junior. JIMMY Ooooooh.     Very deep. HALLENBECK So deep I don't know what the fuck it means. JIMMY It means another drink is required. He raises the bottle. 
JIMMY Alex the accountant. He drinks.   Hallenbeck frowns, watching him. HALLENBECK Is Alex your accountant? JIMMY No.  But he could have been. (beat) Alex was my son. Hallenbeck stares at him. JIMMY I was married at 19. Sweet young thing, looking to get out from under daddy's thumb. I didn't know she was a junkie. All during her pregnancy. Shooting up. There were complications. She died. Alex lived for seventeen minutes in the incubator. Fell asleep. Died before he woke up. (takes a drink) He was born... He had time for one dream... and then he died. I wonder what his dream was about. HALLENBECK I'm sorry. JIMMY I think about him a lot.     I mean, who was this... guy? (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JIMMY (CONT'D) This little guy who only got seventeen minutes, who was he, Joe...? What was he like? (beat) What would he have been? HALLENBECK He would have been a great ball player. Like his dad. JIMMY (shakes his head) No. He had to die, Joe.     Don't you see? 
HALLENBECK Why did he have to die? JIMMY (softly) Because he came out of me. He puts aside the bottle.    Scowls. JIMMY I'm gonna borrow your shower. He exits.    Hallenbeck watches him go.     Says nothing. 
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION Jimmy enters and shuts the door. Turns on the shower. Makes no move to undress. Instead, he reaches inside the waistband on his pants. Removes a vial of coke. Dips a spoon. The door opens. Hallenbeck is standing there with a handful of fresh towels. He stops. Staring at Jimmy. They freeze in tableau. Then Hallenbeck crosses the floor with two quick strides and slugs Jimmy with all his might. Decks him. The kid goes over backward into the shower, head striking the porcelain. He swerves. Claws his way out, drenched. HALLENBECK Not in my house, you dumb motherfucker. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JIMMY Joe, man, you don't get it -- HALLENBECK Shut up. He picks up the vial of powder. HALLENBECK This is what you went looking for in Cory's apartment, isn't it? You found this when you found that envelope. He crosses to the toilet.    Jimmy cries out. 
EXT. CASA LOMA APARTMENTS - MORNING Another Goddamned day. A chill drizzle. The palm trees look forlorn. 
AT CORNER NEWSSTAND Jimmy buys a paper. Trudges along Ventura Boulevard. Huddled against the chill. 
SLEEK, BLACK SEDAN slides to the curb in front of him. Two men get out: One is Pablo, who last we saw wielding a chainsaw in Milo's snuff film; the other is an ugly piece of hired muscle who we'll call CHET. The two men flank Jimmy and walk alongside him. He looks up, startled. 
PABLO Good morning, Jimmy. JIMMY Who are you, and how the fuck do you know my name? CHET (frowns) This is the guy? You sure it's the guy? PABLO This is him. CHET The kid with the million-dollar arm? PABLO Yeah. CHET Shit. He don't look like much.     I wouldn't pay no million dollars for this bozo. PABLO Neither will anyone else, anymore. JIMMY I'm growing whiskers here, guys. You got something to say, fucking say it. CHET Wow. Tough guy stuff. Must have caught it from his buddy Hallenbeck. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JIMMY Who? PABLO Don't play dumb, shithead. You were with him last night at the club. CHET Mr. Marcon sent us to teach you a lesson, Jimmy. Something about keeping your big coked-up nose out of his fucking business. PABLO Get ready, kid. This one's an E ticket. And, with that, they grab Jimmy under the arms. Carry him across the sidewalk to a plywood fence. JIMMY Please, guys, don't do this... Jesus Christ, I was just her boyfriend, I swear to God, please! They toss Jimmy over the fence. 
ANOTHER ANGLE Not a terrible fate, under normal circumstances. In this case, however -- A fifty-foot drop... 
Awaits him beyond the fence. A huge, looming pit dug into the earth. Foundation for a new parking garage. Jimmy plummets like a stone. Under normal circumstances, he'd be dead. But since it rained last night, he's got three feet of water to land in. He hits with a splash.   Disappears beneath the water. Surfaces, screaming in pain. Thrashes in the muddy water, and only when he looks down does he notice the splintered bone jutting out of his skin at a crazy angle. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: His million-dollar arm.    His throwing arm. He clutches at cracked ribs, screaming: JIMMY Oh, God, my arm, my fucking arm, oh Jesus Christ!!! He kneels in the muddy water, rocking back and forth. 
LONG SHOT - JIMMY Alone in the pit. Huddled in a pool of muddy water. His screams of pain ECHO in the chill, morning air. 
INT. LAPD ROBBERY/HOMICIDE DIVISION - DAY Ben Bessalo's office, to be precise. Bessalo reclines grumpily at his desk. Scanning reports. McCaskey hangs up the phone and calls across the room: McCASKEY I got bad news and bad news. BESSALO Gimmee the bad news first. McCASKEY Bad news is, they just pulled Jimmy Dix out of a construction site on Ventura. He's busted up. BESSALO Okay, now gimme the bad news. McCASKEY I just got a call from Hallenbeck's neighbor. Bessalo looks up, intrigued.    McCaskey continues: McCASKEY Now, according to Hallenbeck, Mike Miller came to the house early that morning to talk about a case, right? BESSALO Right. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: McCASKEY Okay. So how come Hallenbeck's neighbor claims that Miller's car was parked there all night, in the same spot? Bessalo sits bolt upright.   Eyes glazed.   Wheels turning. BESSALO He lied.   Why did he lie...? Realization hits him like a thunderbolt. BESSALO Shit.   Miller was fucking his wife. McCASKEY What? BESSALO That's why the car was there, Miller was fucking Hallenbeck's wife, Hallenbeck just got back from out of town, remember? (beat) Christ, Joe wasted the bastard himself! He stabs a button on the phone.   Barks into the receiver: BESSALO I want an A.P.B. out on Joe Hallenbeck. Now. Find him and if he resists arrest, shoot the bastard. 
He slams down the phone.   Stares, stricken, at McCaskey. BESSALO I let him go, Mick. He wasted Mike Miller and waltzed right out of my office, I let him go, Goddammit! McCASKEY Relax, Ben. We'll bring him in. He's not that good. BESSALO You wanna bet? And, with that, we promptly -- CUT TO: 
JOE HALLENBECK'S UNCONSCIOUS FACE Weathered.   Sallow.   Dark circles under the eyes. 
He takes a moment to gather his thoughts. MARCON For starters, I'm sure you're aware that professional football is changing, and not for better. (lights a cigar) Used to be, you went to the local stadium come Sunday, you saw heroes. Guys who fought for their hometown. Anymore, no one gives a shit. Ever since Sonny Werblin paid $400,000 to Joe Namath back in '66, the sons of bitches just got greedier. Playing only for themselves. Giving nothing back to the game. Pablo hands him a double bourbon. 
MARCON This year, the final blow: the N.F.L. votes to decertify the Players Organization. Eliminates the draft, reduces all athletes to free agents. Reduces football, once and for all, to commerce. To greed, you follow? HALLENBECK When do I say the Pledge of Allegiance? Marcon looks directly at Hallenbeck. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MARCON Do you know how many ratings points Monday Night Football lost this year? Per week? An average of two point eight. HALLENBECK Oh, for Chrissake. You're telling me this whole thing is about TV ratings? MARCON People have stopped watching, Joe! Everybody's turning the channel, they're still looking for heroes, you follow? Guys like you. Milo here tells me you took a bullet for the President, jumped in front of a sniper rifle. Hallenbeck reacts, startled.   Looks at Milo. MILO We took the liberty of researching your background. MARCON How about it, Joe? Is it truth or hype? HALLENBECK (shrugs) I got the rifle in my closet as a souvenir. MARCON There you go, that's what I'm saying. The public wants real heroes. Not a bunch of football prima donnas, jumping from team to team with their fancy lawyers. (beat) In fact, Joe, and this is my point, there's only one reason left nowadays to watch pro- football. Can you guess? It begins to dawn on Hallenbeck. HALLENBECK Gambling. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MARCON Exactly. Gambling. (puffs his cigar) Just one problem: football gambling is illegal in all but two of the fifty states. And that, Joe boy, is where I come in. HALLENBECK (sudden realization) Shit, that's what this is about! You're bribing United States senators. Paying them to pass legislation -- 
MARCON -- Legalizing football gambling in all fifty states. Exactly. HALLENBECK Attendance goes up again.   TV ratings go up again. MARCON You got it, son. The networks are happy. I'm happy. Everybody's happy. HALLENBECK Before we get too fucking happy, let's get a couple things straight: first, I'm not your fucking son, and second... why am I still alive? Marcon stops pacing.   Sighs and sits down facing Hallenbeck. 
MARCON It's like this, Joe: everything was going great until a couple weeks ago, and then I hit a snag: Senator Calvin Baynard. HALLENBECK (takes a sip of bourbon) I don't get it. What's the snag? MARCON I offered him the bribe and he wouldn't take it. Hallenbeck actually does a spit-take.     Sprays bourbon. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLEBECK Baynard? Are you nuts? The guy's so crooked he shits slinkies. MARCON Allow me to clarify: I offered him the bribe, and he turned it down because he wanted more money. HALLENBECK (sighs with relief) Thank God. For a minute there I felt hell freezing over. Did he ask for more than a million? 
MARCON Does the Pope shit in the woods? He wants two million or he'll blow the lid off my whole plan. I don't feel like paying no two mil, so basically that good ole' boy's gotta die. HALLENBECK Taking off a U.S. senator, that's pretty ballsy. Even for an asshole like you. MARCON Oh, I'm not going to kill Baynard, Joe. HALLENBECK Who is? Marcon says nothing.   Just looks at Hallenbeck and smiles. HALLENBECK Oh, shit. He rubs tired eyes. HALLENBECK I'm the perfect fall guy. Everyone and his uncle Max knows I hate Baynard. MARCON (nods) Anything goes wrong, all the heat lands on you, Joe boy. My hands are clean. Hallenbeck scowls. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Any particular reason I should go along with this prize-winning scheme? MARCON (smiles) Just one. He motions to Milo, who disappears through a doorway. Reappears a moment later. He's got Joe's wife. 
ANGLE ON HALLENBECK He stands. Face contorting. Fists clenched. Rage courses through him like an electric current. Marcon cocks his gun. MARCON Sit down, Joe. A moment.    Joe stands, smouldering.   On fire.   Sarah speaks: SARAH Do what he says, Joe. Joe sits. Breathing shallowly. Eyes locked on Milo. HALLENBECK Are you alright, Sarah? 
SARAH Yes. MILO That's a temporary condition, Joseph. As you may be aware, there are distributors in Mexico who positively crave snuff films. And unless you do every fucking thing Mr. Marcon tells you... your wife will make her motion picture debut. He meets Joe's murderous gaze... and smiles. 
INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Jimmy is seated, shirtless, on a metal examining table. His ribs are taped. His arm in a cast. Two men loom over him, sour expressions on their faces: Sergeants McCaskey and Bessalo. Jimmy shakes his head, exasperated: JIMMY Look, I'll say it again for the cheap seats: I don't know anything and I can't help you. Okay? Can I go now? 
Bessalo grimaces in disgust. BESSALO Let me get this straight: you're walking along, minding your own business, when two guys you never met jump you and throw you in a ditch for no particular reason. Is that it? JIMMY That's it. BESSALO You're full of shit, kid. (beat) Tell me where Hallenbeck is. JIMMY How the fuck should I know?    Try his house. 
CONTINUED: PABLO Stay down, fucker. Don't you move. At that moment, Milo comes striding down the dock. Whistling cheerfully. MILO Careful, Pablo. We don't want to get Mrs. Hallenbeck all excited in front of hubby. He squats next to Joe. MILO Hello, Joseph, guess what? Time to go, and remember: you follow orders, or the missus pays the price. HALLENBECK You're gonna kill us both anyway. MILO Perhaps. But there are ways to die, and then there are... ways to die. Capisce? You determine your wife's fate. He yanks Hallenbeck to his feet. Propels him toward the boat. As her husband is being led away, Sarah calls out: SARAH Joe...! 
He stops.    Turns.   Looks at her. Boys and girls, there is, within Joe Hallenbeck, a spark: Tiny. Fizzling. Almost gone. But now, looking at his wife, that spark unexpectedly kindles -- And eight years melt away. Just like that. The old Joe Hallenbeck looks his wife in the eye and says, with deadly calm: (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLENBECK I'll be back. (beat) That's a promise. Milo clubs Joe in the head with his pistol. MILO You're wasting my time, Joseph. Let's go. Hallenbeck turns. Dirty. Tired.        Unshaven.   Bloody. He looks at Milo... and grins: HALLENBECK If you touch me again... I'll kill you. They stare into each other's eyes. Hallenbeck does not give an inch. Milo hits him again. 
INT. TOPANGA CANYON HOME - DAY Remember Jimmy's friend, Henry, who we met briefly near the opening of the film? Of course you do, you're a highly-paid reader or development person. Well, Henry is seated in a big, lived-in den watching football films. The walls around him are adorned with hunting paraphernalia. Rifles. Trophies. There is a KNOCK at the door. He gets up. Crosses to the door. Opens it. 
And Jimmy Dix is there.     He gets right to the point: JIMMY I need to borrow a gun, Henry. 
INT. EXPENSIVE, WOOD-PANELED OFFICE - AFTERNOON Conrad Marcon sits behind a huge teak desk. Surrounded by football paraphernalia. Paintings. Trophies. The PHONE CHIRPS.     He picks up the receiver.    Stabs a button. MARCON Marcon. INTERCUT: 
ON SHIPBOARD - MILO MILO It's Milo, sir. We're now underway and should be lying off Catalina within two hours. MARCON Good boy, Milo. The commissioner's party starts at six. I'll put in a token appearance around six-thirty. MILO Very good, sir. MARCON Any problems with Hallenbeck? 
MILO No, we're getting along famously. MARCON Glad to hear it. No fuckups, Milo. I want him deep-sixed. MILO I assure you, neither he nor the senator will see another sunrise. MARCON Christ, Milo, how come you always have to talk like a fruit? MILO If it annoys you, I    could always adopt a Texas drawl,    though I'm afraid I don't know    any stories about fucking pigs.     Sir. 
MARCON Cows, Milo.   Never pigs. MILO I'll remember that, sir. He hangs up. Marcon replaces the receiver and chuckles. MARCON Goddamn fruitcake. He turns, and suddenly we realize he's not alone in the room: a STRANGE MAN is seated in the shadows off to one side. His face is obscured... Marcon addresses him: (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MARCON So far, so good. The Man in the corner nods, then speaks. As he does, we notice he has a speech impediment; it sounds like he's talking with his mouth full. STRANGE MAN We've worked too hard, Con. There's no margin for error. MARCON Take it easy, buddy.   We're covered. 
STRANGE MAN You're using the first team, yes? MARCON Absolutely. (sighs) Actually, I have no choice. STRANGE MAN How's that? MARCON Fuckin' Hallenbeck killed the second and third teams. 
EXT. LONG BEACH BOAT YARD - AFTERNOON A sign reads, BOAT RENTALS:   DAY AND WEEK. Jimmy moves briskly down a concrete ramp toward a Hatteras sport charter. He is obsessed. Determined. Darian trots along behind him. She's holding up pretty well, considering. DARIAN What do you need a boat for? JIMMY I'm gonna crash a party out on Catalina. Marcon will be there. He swings a bag of gear onto the boat.   Starts to store it. DARIAN Maybe... we should call the police. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JIMMY No, honey. Not now. There's some big shots involved in this mess, and it's my word against theirs. If I blab to the cops, your mom and dad will disappear and they'll never find the bodies. (beat) I'm sorry, Darian. DARIAN (about to cry) So... what do we do...? JIMMY What I do... is confront Conrad Marcon and threaten to go to the cops, unless he gives them back. DARIAN Is that gonna work? JIMMY Beats me, but I think it's what your dad would do. DARIAN I'm scared. JIMMY Me, too, honey. His gear stashed, he turns to Darian.   Tries a smile. JIMMY So... why'd you come to me, anyhow? DARIAN I don't know. I thought you'd... know what happened, know what to do... (beat) I mean, you were one of my dad's big heroes. Jimmy almost chokes... JIMMY What? (CONTINUED) 
INT. MILO'S YACHT - CABIN - SAME TIME 
The payoff is in progress. One of Milo's crewmen carries the suitcase over to the wall. Places it on a built-in counter. Underneath the suitcase is a half-finished jigsaw puzzle. Off to one side is a half-empty coffee container. The case is opened.   Greenbacks galore. Baynard's Aide whistles softly. Examines the stacks of bills. Nods, satisfied. AIDE Okay.   We're cool. Just then Milo enters the cabin.   Adopts a harsh New York accent as he angrily barks: MILO Hey! Any of you stupid fucks bother to frisk this goombah? CREWMAN No, sir, we didn't think -- MILO Exactly, you didn't think! Goddammit, that's two million bucks there, now frisk the fuckin' guy! AIDE Hey, baby, I'm clean, take it easy -- MILO Fuck easy. Against the wall, spread 'em! (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: As Baynard's man assumes the position -- Milo hits a concealed button. It happen in less than a second: the built-in counter rotates into the wall, only to be replaced by an indentical counter. Identical half-finished jigsaw puzzle. Identical coffee cup. And, of course, the identical suitcase. The indignant Aide turns around, pat-down concluded. AIDE Okay?   Satisfied? 
Milo smiles apologetically. MILO We're cool, baby. He hands over the suitcase. 
BACK TOPSIDE Baynard's man emerges onto the deck, carrying the suitcase. Steps over the rail, crossing to the Senator's boat. Gives a thumbs up to the men waiting there. They cast off the lines.   Freeing the two boats. INT. MILO'S YACHT - BRIDGE Milo watches, tense. As the lines are freed, he says: 
MILO Hard to starboard, get us out of here. Back off a hundred yards and wait for the blast. 
INT. SENATOR'S CABIN - SAME TIME The go-between heads   below deck, carrying the suitcase. Senator Baynard puts   down his wine glass. Looks up, expectant. The Aide flashes an "A-Okay" grin. Sets the suitcase on a table. Meanwhile -- 
INT. JIMMY'S SPORT BOAT - BRIDGE Jimmy has had about enough.    He sighs with frustration. Stares ahead into the fog. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JIMMY All we're doing is burning gas. Sorry, kid, I'm turning back. The words are barely out of his mouth when he hears a throbbing NOISE, growing louder... Darian looks up puzzled. DARIAN Do you hear that -- ? And with that -- 
AIR ONE 
bursts from the fog. Directly in front of them. Hovers like an avenging angel, TURBINES SCREAMING -- JIMMY Holy fucking shit! Rotor wash sprays in every direction. The noise is deafening. 
INT. AIR ONE - COCKPIT The PILOT grabs the mike and shouts into it: PILOT Code yellow, code yellow, we got a bogie, repeat, we got a bogie, over. 
INT. MILO'S YACHT - BRIDGE Milo snaps his head to one side, hearing this. Grabs the mike: MILO Air One, Air One, where the fuck is he? PILOT (V.O.) Nine o'clock, repeat, on your nine, and closing fast! 
CONTINUED: Works his bound hands over his knees so they're now tied in front of him. Everybody's topside; for the moment, at least, he is forgotten. He half crawls, half lurches over to the kitchen nook. Worms beneath the table... awkward, desperate... Drags out the can of gasoline. Tries to unscrew the top.   No dice.   Can't get a grip. Finally, in frustration, he tips the can on its side. Brings his legs up in the air -- Slams them down on the can. Over and over until, with a metallic pop -- ! it bursts. Floods gasoline over the carpet, meanwhile: 
BACK TOPSIDE Milo's yacht is plowing ahead, gaining on Jimmy's Hatteras. The crew members take up positions on the prow. OPEN FIRE. 
WITH JIMMY As he throws Darian to the deck, shields her with his body. The wheelhouse is RAKED by GUNFIRE. He grits his teeth. Reaches beneath his tux. Yanks out the BERETTA and returns FIRE, BAM -- BAM -- ! and meanwhile: 
INT. YACHT CABIN Hallenbeck is opening a box of kitchen matches with his teeth. Dozens of matches fall scattered on the carpet. He releases the box. Bends. Picks up a single match in his teeth. Presses his face to the wall.   Gives his neck a wrench -- Lights the match. He drops the match on top of the GAS CAN. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: A WHOOSH of combustion.    It bursts into flame. Joe swivels around. Balancing on his backside. Thrusts his legs into the fire. Strains. Pulls. Sweat runs in rivers. Until the ropes binding his legs snap. He lurches to his feet, lets free. Now there's only one problem: He's on fire. The legs of his pants are soaked with gas. Flames race up his legs. He plunges headlong up the stairs. 
ON TO DECK where he hurtles toward the rail, dives -- into the sea, swallowed by the waves. A CREWMAN suddenly screams: CREWMAN Fire in the hole! Fire, indeed.    It's a rapidly-spreading blaze. The pursuit is momentarily forgotten as the crew races to put out the fire, and meanwhile: 
HALLENBECK surfaces, gasping for air.    Trying to swim with his hands tied. 
DARIAN spots him first. Sees her father bobbing like a cork in the ocean, screams: DARIAN Daddy!! Jimmy whirls around, startled. JIMMY Shit.    I don't believe it. DARIAN Do something!     Hurry! (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Jimmy spins the wheel. Banks hard to port. Brings the boat around in an arc. Yells to Darian: JIMMY Keep the wheel like this!   Don't let it move! She grabs the wheel. Jimmy bends down. Opens a compart- ment. Takes out the boat's anchor. Metal hook, attached to seventy yards of chain. He hefts it like a grappling hook. JIMMY Third and long, baby, lets' go... 
And, sure, his left arm isn't his good arm -- But, boy, does he heave that anchor. It soars through space, chain playing out behind it... Hits water, thirty yards past Hallenbeck -- Who turns, sees the anchor skimming toward him over the waves. 
EXT. MILO'S YACHT Milo, meanwhile, has also spotted Hallenbeck. He growls in rage.   Hefts the Ingram machine gun, as: 
ANOTHER ANGLE Hallenbeck thrusts forward, hooks his bound hands around the passing anchor and whoosh -- ! 
He is catapulted forward, jerked like a rag puppet. BULLETS CHOP the water where he just was. He skims over the waves. Bounced. Battered. Trailing behind Jimmy at fifty miles an hour. Jimmy and Darian begin to haul him in. Struggling. Straining. The boat rushing headlong, driverless. With a last, desperate surge of energy -- They drag Hallenbeck over the side. Into the boat. DARIAN Dad...! (CONTINUED) 
EXT. BAYNARD'S BOAT - SAME TIME The once-mighty Marlineer runs aimless circles in the mist. Half the cockpit is blown away, probably by a LAWS rocket. The Hatteras pulls up alongside, and Hallenbeck steps to the rail, carrying the Baretta. HALLENBECK Wait here. He swings aboard the senator's boat. Gun cocked. Ready. 
INT. SENATOR'S BOAT - COCKPIT Enters the cockpit. What's left of the roof is bullet- pocked. The navigator is dead. Slumped over the controls. Joe pulls him off the panel. KILLS the ENGINE. 
INT. MAIN CABIN Joe bursts inside.    Hard and fast.   Gun leveled. No need. It's a slaughterhouse. The walls are perforated. Baynard and his men are dead. The suitcase's evil twin lies unopened on the table. Hallenbeck walks over to Baynard's lifeless body. Stares into the wide-open eyes. HALLENBECK Sorry, Cal.    Life in the big city. CUT TO: EXT. LONG BEACH BOAT RENTALS - NIGHT The senator's boat pulls up to the dock.     No one is around. 
EXT. DOCK - SAME TIME Hallenbeck crouches next to Darian, looks her in the eye. HALLENBECK Listen carefully. I'm gonna go get your mom back, okay? You're gonna go in the Denny's restaurant and stay there. Talk to the waitress but don't mention me. Mom and I will come pick you up later, got it? DARIAN (crying) They're gonna kill you...! 
HALLENBECK Are you kidding? I do this for a living. (hands her a twenty) Buy me an ice cream. I'll be back. (beat) I love you. She throws her arms around him. CUT TO: 
INT. RENTAL SUBARU - DRIVING - NIGHT All business now. Deadly serious. Jimmy and Joe stare ahead through the windshield.    Grim. Tense. In the back seat sits the coveted suitcase. JIMMY Your prints are all over that boat. What happens when they find the bodies inside? HALLENBECK Quit being a fuckin' killjoy. He cuts the headlights.   Cruises to a stop behind a road- side dumpster. HALLENBECK Come on.   We've got some things to pick up. 
EXT. HALLENBECK'S HOUSE (WEST L.A.) - NIGHT They creep across a suburban lawn, hugging the shadows. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Across the street, Hallenbeck's house is dark.       Deserted. Truly a sight: Jimmy, in a white shirt and tuxedo pants, nursing a broken arm; and Joe, drenched to the skin, pants hanging in scorched tatters. Joe suddenly puts up a restraining hand. They stop. Crouched behind a eucalyptus tree. Joe points: 
THEIR POV A late-model Buick is parked just up the street from his house... There is a man slouched inside. Smoking. 
BACK TO SCENE HALLENBECK Shit.   Someone's staking me out. JIMMY (clears his throat) Oh, I forgot to tell you. The police want you for killing Mike Miller. Hallenbeck shoots him a withering look. CUT TO: 
EXT. COASTAL WATERS - NIGHT A Coast Guard cutter is circling the site of the boat/ chopper crash. A uniformed ENSIGN shines a light on the dark waters. ENSIGN I think I got someone!   Four o'clock! 
MILO is draped over a piece of wooden wreckage. Half his hair is burned away. His face is blistered. He looks up, pleading, at the Ensign, as: 
ANOTHER ANGLE He hides the Ingram beneath his body, cocked and ready. CUT TO: 
CONTINUED: Baynard draws down on Jimmy, who picks up a flaming log and hurls it, knocks the SHOT wild, as: Marcon darts out the French doors, into the night, so Hallenbeck spins, FIRES at Baynard -- Blows him backward in a bloody spray.    Baynard sags against the mantel. Collapses, dead. ECHOES. Silence.   Jimmy and Joe are alone with three corpses. Jimmy snatches up a pistol. Joe slings the sniper rifle over his shoulder. Stares at Jimmy: 
HALLENBECK Plastic keys...? The kind that melt? JIMMY Hey.   Short notice, best I could do. HALLENBECK You did fine, junior. JIMMY Learned it from a pro.     Come on. 
EXT. MARCON'S HOUSE - NIGHT The wooden garage DOORS EXPLODE outward, bursting to splinters, as a Ford BRONCO DRIVES right THROUGH them, Conrad Marcon at the wheel. He careens off into the night. Makes a getaway. 
INT. GARAGE - SAME TIME Jimmy and Joe come racing out of the house, just in time to see Marcon's taillights disappearing up the canyon. JIMMY Son of a bitch! HALLENBECK Forget about him. Let's get my wife. He crosses to a parked Mercedes. SHOOTS open the door. Gets in. Pops the ignition package. Hotwires it. The CAR ROARS to life. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Get in. He's so slick, it's scary. 
EXT. MARCON'S HOUSE - SAME TIME The Mercedes barrels out through the splintered garage doors. BURNS RUBBER down the hill. 
INT. CAR - DRIVING They stare straight ahead.   Tense.   Breathless. 
HALLENBECK On my way, honey, on my way... 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT Conrad Marcon, meanwhile, is rocketing along the winding road, heading up the canyon, when he sees something ahead: 
HIS POV - JOE'S RENTAL SUBARU sitting abandoned in the roadside brush. 
BACK TO SCENE Acting on a sudden hunch, he SLAMS ON the BRAKES. Stops the car. Gets out, crosses to the rental. Peeks in. A two-million-dollar suitcase sits, pretty as punch, on the back seat. MARCON Shit, Joe Boy, you wasn't bluffing... He draws his gun. Blows out the glass. Reaches in. Opens the car door. Snatches up the briefcase. CUT TO: 
EXT. DOWNTOWN HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT A block of seedy-looking brick buildings.      Off Sunset. Not many people at this hour. 
MERCEDES slews around the corner races down the street, running without headlights. Lurches to a halt near the mouth of an alley. Jimmy and Joe burst from the car, guns in hand. Hellenbeck is grim, purposeful. Jimmy is nervous. JIMMY I'm new at this, Joe.   How do we do it? HALLENBECK We get in, we get out. Shoot anyone who's not my wife. Check that: Don't shoot me. He jacks a fresh clip into his rifle. CUT TO: 
EXT. JOE'S OFFICE - NIGHT Joe exits the office, starts across the lawn toward the vehicle with the flashing light. Realizes with a sudden shock:   something's wrong. HALLENBECK That's not L.A.P.D.... 
HALLENBECK'S POV 
the insignia on the door panel reads LONG BEACH SHORE PATROL. In the same glance, he sees there's a dead cop slumped in the passenger seat, and worse, much worse than that: Milo is in the driver's seat. 
WIDER ANGLE Milo, who steps out of the car and promptly OPENS FIRE on Joe. HALLENBECK Son of a bitch! He dives for cover, the turf erupting all around him, as: 
INT. OFFICE - SAME Sarah sits bolt upright. Eyes panicked.    Terrified. Darian comes awake, screaming: DARIAN Mommy, what's happening? Sarah leaps off the couch, cradling Darian and meanwhile -- 
EXT. OFFICE - SAME Hallenbeck spins behind one of the billboard support legs, as BULLETS CHOP it to splinters. 
MILO advances. changing clips.    Methodical.   Precise. Like a robot. He is obsessed.    All vestige of sanity gone. MILO You fucked up my face, Joseph! Joe starts to climb. Scales the wooden structure. Swings himself onto the raised platform. Flattens behind the billboard. MILO Don't try to hide, Joseph. I've got all night, you fucked up my face. He sprays a BURST of GUNFIRE up at the billboard. 
HALLENBECK huddles behind the billboard as the bullets stitch upward. Through the wooden frame. A hot SLUG RIPS through Joe's arm. An eruption of blood. He hisses in pain. Rolls away from the gunfire. Looks around. Desperate. Sees a painter's bucket lying nearby. He counts to three. 
DOWN BELOW Milo calmly changes clips. Hallenbeck bursts from cover. Hurls the bucket down at Milo, dashes across the front of the billboard, hard and fast -- BULLETS CHOPPING the board right behind him, blowing holes in Gorgeous's derrierre -- And then Joe does a risky thing: He sprints to the end of the billboard, running full tilt, and he leaps out into space, what the hell is he doing? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He's trying to make the freeway. It's a good fifteen feet.   Try it sometime. He flies through open air -- Milo's GUN CHATTERING below, seeking him out -- And just does make it. Hits the freeway surface and collapses forward, screaming as he rolls on his injured arm... Looks up -- 
EIGHTEEN WHEEL TRUCK 
is headed straight for him, bearing down...! He rolls aside just in time. It THUNDERS past. Staggers to his feet, frantic -- and Milo is climbing the billboard. Hallenbeck looks for a place to hide. There isn't any. He's going to have to run through traffic. He shifts from foot to foot, searching for an opening, and meanwhile -- 
INT. SUBARU - DRIVING Jimmy Dix is actually on the freeway, driving, when he looks across the center divider and sees Hallenbeck.

1   EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY                                    1 
The lush Pangani Mountains of Africa, mysterious and seemingly untouched. 
2   EXT. PANGANI FOREST - DAY                                    2 
A warm golden light bathes the jungle. Shafts of sunlight filter through the forest floor. The sounds of WILD BIRDS break the hushed quiet of the setting. As we MOVE IN we FIND a large female mountain gorilla lounging, eating leaves in the dense undergrowth, her precocious baby gorilla plays nearby. 
THROUGH CAMERA LENS 
A view of the mother gorilla, a few PICTURES SNAPPED. 
BACK TO SCENE 
The photographer is RUTH YOUNG, naturalist, researcher, sitting in the undergrowth with her camera, notebooks, and sketch pad. Her precocious young daughter, JILL, plays nearby. 
Jill smiles, watching the baby gorilla clown. As the baby sees her, he suddenly scampers to a nearby tree and hides his face behind it. Jill does the same. She peeks out to catch a glimpse, just as the baby peeks out to catch her eye. They both scamper to different trees. Each time they move to a different tree, they go through this peek-a-boo interaction, both moving further away from their mothers. The mother GORILLA notices, lets out a CRY. Ruth looks around for Jill and signals by a distinctive whistle for her to come back this instant. 
Both children take a last look at each other and then scurry to their waiting mothers. 
RUTH Jill.   What did I tell you? 
JILL But Joe started it! 
RUTH It's not good for them to interact with us. (gathering her things) Besides, that wasn't Joe. It was Marley. 
(CONTINUED)

Jill helps her mother heft the equipment as they start to head back to camp. 
JILL No it wasn't.    It was Joe. 
RUTH Joe is just a baby, Jill.      He was too big to be Joe. 
As they walk, they can see the sunset over the mountain trail. 
JILL Check.   Check the pictures. 
Ruth looks down at her daughter, surprised by the confidence in her voice. 
3   EXT. EQUATORIAL SKY - NIGHT                                  3 
The Southern Cross above the horizon. The Milky Way a dusty streak of white. A shooting star streaks in an arc down to the -- 
MOUNTAIN RANGE 
The dark peaks silhouetted against the stellar glow. 
POV SHOT 
Charging THROUGH dense, primeval forest. We hear an eerie metallic JANGLE of what sounds like wind chimes riding right with us. Something is moving quickly up this mountain. 
4   EXT. PANGANI JUNGLE - NIGHT                                  4 
Bursting THROUGH FRAME -- a pack of mongrel hunting dogs driven hard by a half dozen African men with rifles. 
Poachers wielding pangas (machetes). A glint of silver as a panga sweeps ACROSS FRAME, hacking at the wall of thistles and nettles. 
ON DOGS 
Eyes yellow. Teeth flared. The RINGING sound made by TIN SQUARES cut from cans, tied by rawhide around their necks. CLANG-CLANG-CLANG. One poacher whips his panga again. (CONTINUED)

PUNCH IN to reveal -- impaled in the earth, a three-foot stick figure with a macabre animal skull for a head. The poacher shouts in local dialect until -- A foul-looking man, GARTH, pushes INTO FRAME. Carrying a heavy Weatherby Mark V rifle across his back. Garth yanks the primitive doll from the ground. Looks back as -- A figure approaches in the darkness. 
A glowing cigar clenched in his stained teeth, STRASSER checks the doll over -- primitive, grotesque; then snaps it in two. Tossing it away contemptuously, he shouts orders in the local dialect. 
The men continue up the path. Dogs sweeping behind like a wildfire. CLANG-CLANG-CLANG. PAN UP OVER TO -- 
5   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                            5 
The RING of the DOG COLLARS floats on a night breeze across a deep valley to the other side of the mountain, down to a... 
CLEARING 
A small circle of huts forming a campsite around a night fire. We go inside... 
one of them -- 
6   INT. HUT - NIGHT                                               6 
Ruth Young's hut. On one side is a makeshift field laboratory, highlighted by a wall collage of photos -- family shots mixed right in with gorilla shots. 
RUTH 
sits on the edge of a cot, tucking Jill into bed.   She leans down, kisses Jill gently on her forehead. 
RUTH Jill, what made you think the gorilla we saw today was Joe? 
Strasser spins to see several gorillas, darting from the trees, a blur of black shapes trying to escape up the mountain. 
CLOSE ON ONE FEMALE 
The same one Ruth watched earlier. Joe clings tightly to her back, his eyes wide with fear. 
JOE'S POV 
A nightmarish collage of images accompanied by the CLANGING of the dogs' COLLARS, the charge of the African poachers, the SCREAMS of the MOTHER and the other GORILLAS. Then he sees Strasser run forward, raise his rifle with icy precision. 
THROUGH SCOPE 
Strasser has Joe's mother dead on. Her head in the cross-hairs as she tries to get away. The MOTHER'S raspy animal SCREAM is unmistakably maternal, heart-breaking. It ECHOES across the mountain as she tries to reach a deep stretch of woods. 
On her back, Joe turns once more to look back and sees -- 
EXTREME CLOSEUP - STRASSER'S TRIGGER FINGER 
squeezing gently, the EXPLOSION of the SHOT RATTLES the forest. 
The MOTHER'S SCREAM is CUT OFF sharply. 
ON JOE 
We see Joe thrown THROUGH FRAME, tumbling into the high grass. 
Then, silence. 
STRASSER AND GARTH 
crash through the dense foliage to retrieve the body. The DOGS SNAPPING behind. CLANG-CLANG-CLANG. 
(CONTINUED)

GARTH (shouting) Get the baby! 
STRASSER (shouting) Don't shoot it! They want the babies alive!! Bring the sack! 
CLOSE ON JOE 
He SCREAMS wildly, darts back and forth, desperately looking for his mother. 
JOE'S POV 
THROUGH the tall grass in the b.g., he can see the Africans disappear up the hill hunting down the others. 
BACK TO SCENE 
And then we see Joe's anguish turn to fury. He GROWLS -- and as the two big hunters come nearer -- Joe springs out at them. 
Joe is moving so fast, Strasser barely has time to react before the furry black shape is on top of him -- WIDEN as Joe attacks Strasser, knocking him back. Strasser shouts and drops his rifle. Tries to pull Joe off as they tumble down through the trees. Strasser punches and pulls at this ball of sinew and muscle. He reaches for his Match Master side arm with his right hand. PUNCH IN CLOSE as Joe bites down viciously through the hand. Strasser howls... 
ANGLE ON GARTH 
He has retrieved his rifle and is charging hard for his downed companion. He looks for a clear shot at Joe. PAN RIGHT and RACK FOCUS as Ruth Young explodes from the trees and flashes past Strasser, snatching Joe away. Joe is not quite sure what has happened, but he hangs on to Ruth for dear life. 
Strasser staggers forward, holding his mangled hand. Enraged. 
He rips Garth's gun away from him and with his bloodied hand, finds a way to pull the trigger. SHOTS RIP through BARK but Ruth disappears into the trees like a spirit. 
11   EXT. FOREST - ON JILL - NIGHT                                    11 
Running but nearing exhaustion. Hearing a fusillade of GUNSHOTS -- Jill runs faster, panic contorting her face. 
She runs desperately, swiping at branches, stinging vines. 
ANOTHER POV 
Something is running TOWARDS her. 
12   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                              12 
Jill shines her flashlight into the forest. Further up, someone waves a light back and forth. Like a signal. 
Jill's face lights up. She continues running. Suddenly, Jill is bowled over by Joe who leaps into her arms. They roll on the ground, Jill with the wind knocked out of her. They look into each other's face and both know that the worst is happening. They are both silent with fear. 
Strasser appears through the darkness. His right hand wrapped in a bloody swath. Denying the pain. Garth follows, gun up. 
Jill and Joe lie hiding in the undergrowth. Jill's eyes tell Joe not to make a sound. They barely breathe. 
JILL'S POV 
of Strasser's and Garth's boots. Jill can hear the sound of their voices, but their words are indistinct. 
BACK TO SCENE 
STRASSER (quietly) She's got to be here somewhere. She's got that damn devil with her. 
GARTH (matter-of-fact) I think you might've hit the woman. 
STRASSER (shrugs) These people want to live like heroes, let them die like heroes. 
(CONTINUED) 
12   CONTINUED:                                                          12 
They are nearly on top of Jill and Joe, and their words are now crystal clear. Strasser looks at his bloody, wrapped hand and stares vindictively into the dark forest around him. 
STRASSER That little demon took off my damn trigger finger. (in Roumanian) Monstrule! 
GARTH Your little 'monster' couldn't have gone far. Want to keep looking or...? 
STRASSER (in pain) No.    Let's get out of here. 
Jill and Joe lie still as stone as Strasser and Garth continue past. Once they're gone, Joe and Jill begin to breathe again. Then, Jill sees a light pop on in the darkness. She flashes back. 
JILL Mom! 
racing at breakneck speed over the dirt highway. Driven by GREGG O'HARA -- anyone would consider him young, strong and handsome -- except that right now, it's all hidden under the grime from a long flight and a week's growth of beard. Hair long, unkempt; clothes wrinkled. 
Gregg passes four local men burning a clearing in the woods for yet more farmland. 
Pushing its way up the mountain side. The humvee is packed with EQUIPMENT that RATTLES as Gregg hits every bump in the road. 
17    EXT. VILLAGE - DAY                                               17 
A tiny African village, just a main square with a bar, a school, an infirmary and a gas station. 
Standing smack in the middle of the road is an East Indian with a goatee, wrap-around Black Flys, and a Nike workout suit. 
Gregg's HUMVEE SKIDS to a sharp stop in front of him. 
GREGG You must be Pindi. 
Pindi flashes him a broad smile. 
PINDI The one and only, bro. 
CUT TO: 
17A   EXT. VILLAGE - DAY                                               17A 
Pindi is leading Gregg down a row of vehicles: two Land Rovers, one with a strange-looking seat attached to the front hood, and an old, flatbed lorry. A surly-looking group of men lounge around on them. 
(CONTINUED) 
17A   CONTINUED:                                                      17A 
PINDI Six men, three cars... everything you ask for, Mr. Ohara. (lowering his voice) All paid for in advance, out of Pindi's pocket... 
Gregg holds an envelope filled with cash in Pindi's face. He nods towards the nasty-looking men. 
GREGG Sweet-looking bunch of guys. 
Pindi snatches the envelope -- but Gregg holds onto his end. 
GREGG I asked for experienced trackers. 
PINDI These men are the best -- I assure you. Very best. 
Gregg allows Pindi to pull the envelope away. He immediately rifles through the cash, checking to make sure it's all there. 
Gregg eyes Pindi's men suspiciously, then walks around to the back of his humvee and flips open the storage boot, revealing an array of animal-tracking gadgetry. Pindi looks over his shoulder as Gregg loads a menacing-looking rifle. 
PINDI Nice piece you got there. What are we hunting, elephants? 
GREGG We're not hunting anything. 
Pindi sees that Gregg is loading the rifle with tran- quilizer darts. This confuses him, but he pretends to approve. 
PINDI Ah! Tranquilizer darts. I agree -- much nicer to animals than bullets. 
GREGG (indicating tranquilizer gun) Your men know how to use this, right? 
(CONTINUED) 
17A   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                  17A 
PINDI Oh sure, boss.     Only professionals here. 
Gregg carefully puts the rifle back, then grabs a pair of Minolta 10x20 binoculars. 
PINDI So tell me, boss -- where are we going today? 
ON Gregg, panning across his field of vision with the binoculars. He stops. 
GREGG There. 
POV THROUGH BINOCULARS 
The highest peak in the range, playing hide and seek with the clouds. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Pindi's men see where Gregg is pointing. They murmur, trading grim glances at each other. Pindi jumps with nerves. 
PINDI There? Uh, boss, that is not such a good mountain. The men don't like it very much at all. You see there is a legend they believe in, that a creature lives there... 
Gregg's back to checking his equipment. 
GREGG 'N'Gai Zamu.' The sacred guardian of Mount Pangani. 
Pindi looks at Gregg, surprised he knows this. 
PINDI You know it? How funny! (with dread) That's not, by any chance, what you are looking for, is it, boss? 
Gregg looks from Pindi's nervous face to the serious faces of the trackers. They are all watching him. 
(CONTINUED) 14A.

GREGG Looking for a legend?   No.   Why would I do that? 
Gregg takes the car keys from Pindi's hand.

17A   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             17A 
GREGG Gimme those. 
OFF Pindi -- not particularly thrilled... 
CUT TO: 
18    EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY                                      18 
A nearby Land Rover bounces two feet into the air from the impact. 
His canines are fully exposed. Thick, black hair on his crest stand erect. Deep brown eyes aglow as he gives another DEAFENING CALL. This is JOE. Backlit by the sun he seems to encompass the forest. 
PUSH IN CLOSE ON Gregg's reaction.       In complete awe. 
GREGG Don't anybody move. 
PINDI (frightened out of his wits) How about... I move... just over here... 
(CONTINUED) 
22    CONTINUED:    (4)                                               22 
Pindi scurries for cover behind the frozen, awe- stricken trackers. 
ANGLE - JOE 
moves to the cage and peers inside. The LEOPARD paces and HISSES. Joe straightens up bi-pedally and pounds his massive chest with his fist. The hollow POK-POK-POK ECHOES off the mountain. 
Joe raises his hand again and smashes the top off the cage, as if it were made of matchsticks. The leopard leaps out of the cage and dashes safely into the forest. JOE bares his teeth and ROARS at Gregg, as if to say "stay off my mountain." His mission accomplished, Joe quickly turns and starts back for tree cover. 
Silence. Everyone is open-mouthed, unable to believe what they have just seen... 
Then Greg snaps out of it. Bursting into action, he runs to the humvee, motions to Pindi. 
GREGG Come on!!   We're going after him! 
PINDI What is this 'we'? There is no way my men will ever agree to... 
Gregg yells to the paralyzed trackers: 
GREGG (in Swahili) Three times your price. (in English) Triple your fee. 
That's what it's all about. The men get a move on, running for the vehicles as fast as they can. 
ENGINES REV, DOORS SLAM, as the trackers ready for the chase. All four cars pull out. 
22A   OMITTED                                                         22A

All is silent for a moment, then Joe EXPLODES INTO FRAME. Joe hears the DRONE of ENGINES -- turns to see --

JOE'S POV 
The caravan, looking like the cavalry in a Western, comes charging over the hill. 
Gregg's humvee comes crashing over a ridge in pursuit of Joe. Gregg yells out to the cars around him: 
GREGG Herd him towards me!   I gotta get close. 
Gregg grabs his DNA stick and grins at Pindi. 
GREGG Real close. 
Pindi realizes with a sickening feeling that Gregg is having a major rush. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
The lead car, a Land Rover, comes right up behind Joe. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Joe -- sensing the car next to him, turns and ROARS... 
LAND ROVER 
The guy with the tranquilizer RIFLE panics and FIRES! 
BACK ON JOE 
The dart hits his arm.     Uh oh.   That was a mistake. 
INT. LAND ROVER 
The tracker has just enough time to get a good look at Joe's furious expression before... WHAM! 
Joe throws his shoulder into the side of the Land Rover, sending it tumbling end over end into a ravine. 
ON GREGG 
Disgusted with the guys' stupidity. 
(CONTINUED) 
23   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            23 
GREGG Experienced trackers, my ass! 
Pindi shrugs. The two of them watch as Joe continues running, then changes directions and starts heading straight for them. The humvee has to swerve out of the way to avoid colliding with Joe. 
FOLLOW JOE as he books across the meadow in the opposite direction, now. The modified Land Rover with the hot seat attached to the hood swerves around and chases Joe. They catch up, and the tracker climbs into the hot seat, readying a metal clamp attached to a chain... 
GREGG 
tries to yell across at him. 
GREGG No, we don't want to... 
Too late, the guy's slapped the clamp onto Joe's arm. 
Joe ROARS, tries to shake off the chain, then speeds up. 
THE CHAIN 
The green paradise of the mountain rushes right AT us. Bright blossoms and strange insects. The sun diffuses in daggers of light. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
EXT. PANGANI FOREST - BACK WITH GREGG - DAY 
Gregg climbs over a fallen tree. Ducks under some low branches. Stops to catch his breath. He listens intently. Takes another step forward. Hears a TWIG SNAP. 
THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA 
PAN RIGHT. Joe springs out from hiding -- as gorillas love to do to enemies. He charges Gregg and cuffs him onto his back. Joe is in full attack mode -- eyes wide, teeth exposed. He snatches Gregg by the foot. 
GREGG 
screams as he's jerked helplessly into the air. Joe shakes Gregg viciously -- then whips him back and forth, knocking him against a sapling. Gregg fights to free himself but he's no match for Joe's strength. He knows Joe is going to hurt him badly -- maybe kill him. 
Joe cocks his arm -- to crush Gregg against a wide tree trunk. (CONTINUED)

JILL (O.S.) Joe!   Stop! 
Joe looks surprised, caught with his hand in the cookie jar. 
GREGG'S UPSIDE-DOWN POV 
A beautiful young woman is standing ten feet from him. 
BACK TO SCENE 
GREGG Oh, wow. 
JILL Joe... 
ON Jill -- she looks at Gregg like he's the lowest form of life on earth. 
JILL ... drop him. 
And Joe does, dropping Gregg hard to the ground.   On his head. 
CUT TO BLACK.

POV SHOT 
LOOKING UP AT KWELI, 12 years older than we last saw him. Kweli looks right INTO CAMERA, then says something over his shoulder in Swahili.

Bruised and bandaged, Gregg blinks, trying to bring his eyes into focus.

GREGG Where am I? 
KWELI The infirmary. You've been unconscious for an entire night. You're lucky to be alive. 
Gregg winces as he slowly raises himself to his elbows. 
GREGG Strange, I don't feel lucky. 
He takes in his surroundings; a simple infirmary. THROUGH the open door, he can see the village he started his trip in. 
KWELI You crashed your vehicle. It is waiting for you outside. 
GREGG You're an injury behind. The kicker was getting dropped on my head by N'gai Zamu. 
Kweli chuckles. 
GREGG Think that's funny? You should try it? 
KWELI N'Gai Zamu is just a legend, my friend. 
GREGG No, he's a giant gorilla with a mean backhand. There was also a woman... 
Gregg tries to get up.     It's an ordeal. 
KWELI A woman?

GREGG Out in the jungle. She saved my life. A beautiful woman. 
Kweli gives him a patronizing smile. 
KWELI You were dreaming, Mr. Ohara. 
GREGG No.    I never remember my dreams. 
Gregg sits up in bed and swings his feet to the floor. Kweli turns and heads for the door. 
KWELI It would be wise for you to see a doctor in Kimjayo. I took the liberty of calling one for you. 
GREGG Don't need one. 
KWELI But he is expecting you. If you can drive, you should leave today. 
Kweli walks out of the room. Gregg squints after him, sensing that something is up. 
CUT TO: 
BACK TO SCENE 
Jill continues waving the flashlight, waiting for a response. Then, we hear the sound of SOMETHING LARGE APPROACHING. 
ON GREGG 
The thunderous sound making him nervous... 
ON JILL 
Not so Jill. She waits calmly, at first, as the FOOT- STEPS APPROACH. Then, as the branches begin to bend and break, and we get our first glimpse of fur, she smiles. 
Mighty Joe Young emerges from the brush, not growling, not threatening, but rather looking like a puppy coming to greet his master.

JILL (cooing to Joe) Hey, handsome. How are you? 
ON GREGG 
Absolutely thunderstruck, watching in awe as the giant GORILLA bows his head so Jill can scratch behind his ear. He makes LOW, GUTTURAL SOUNDS that are the gorilla equivalent of a purr. 
Jill inspects Joe, checking him to see if he's okay.       Her voice is full of gentle concern and worry. 
JILL What were you thinking yesterday, letting those men see you? Don't do that again, okay? Please. (praying to herself) Please. 
We see the fear in Jill's face, knowing that Joe can't understand what she's saying. She shakes it off and brightens. She gives Joe a playful tussle, then covers her eyes with her hands. 
JILL One.   Two.   Three. Four... 
It takes only a moment for Joe to respond. His eyes open wide, he looks in every direction then, suddenly, crashes into the woods! 
JILL ... seven, eight, nine, ten. (yelling) Ready or not, here I come!! 
And Jill runs into the woods after Joe.

JILL (theatrically) Oh, my God! I can't find Joe. Where's Joe? 
She stomps around, pretending not to see him. Of course, she knows exactly where he is. He's so big, the tree he's standing behind barely hides one leg. 
CLOSE ON JOE 
He can't help peeking.    He loves this.

Jill pokes her head around every tree. 
JILL Come out, come out... wherever you are! 
Then, pretending that she just spotted him, she charges right at him. 
JILL I found you! 
JOE ROARS, delighted by their game. Jill tussles with him, then gets a mischievous look in her eye. 
JILL Bye-bye, Joe! 
Suddenly, she dashes into the woods -- where she's actually small enough to hide well. Joe passes by her, moving through the foliage. 
In a moment we see how much he fears actually losing her -- he begins to WHIMPER -- and spins around. He stands up to his full height, beats his chest and shakes his head in frustration. He can't bear the idea that she is gone. 
A beat, then Joe starts tearing bushes out by their roots, hunting for Jill. He sees one BUSH RUSTLING, goes over and rips it out of the ground, revealing... 
GREGG 
Standing there, completely exposed, filming all this with his dented video camera. He looks up at Joe towering over him. 
GREGG Oh boy. 
JOE ROARS! 
Gregg stumbles backwards, trapping himself against a tree as Joe advances. Remembering what one should do when faced with an enraged gorilla. Gregg averts his eyes and rolls into a ball, assuming the submissive position. He's like a pill bug, playing dead, protecting the back of his neck with his arms. 
Joe raises his mighty fist -- it looks like he might smash Gregg anyway... but then he hears Jill's voice.

JILL (O.S.) (soothing) Joe!   It's okay. 
Joe stops and turns his head to Jill. 
JILL Now get out of here, Joe.     Run. 
Joe looks at her, not sure why her tone's gotten so stern. 
JILL Run, Joe.   Run! 
Joe looks back at Gregg, still curled into a tight ball. He gives him a playful, parting swat for good measure before obeying Jill and running into the forest. 
The "little swat" is powerful enough to send Gregg rolling like a croquet ball into a thicket of bushes. Painfully, he uncurls, plucking nettles out of his legs as Jill approaches. 
GREGG (pulling out a nettle) Nobody better try and tell me I imagined this. 
Strasser reaches out to pick up the photos, and as he does... 
CLOSE ON STRASSER'S HAND 
A black leather glove-like apparatus with a thumb and forefinger in place that gives the appearance of a whole, if menacing, hand. 
STRASSER Poor thing. Yes, he will be much happier here on our preserve. Back to the wild. Free again. 
A door opens behind Anderson.       Garth sticks his head in the room. 
GARTH Phone for you.     Urgent. 
Strasser stands. 
STRASSER Will you excuse me, Mr. Anderson? 
Strasser turns and follows Garth through the door, into... 
CUT TO: 
35A   INT. BACK ROOM (RAHA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION                      35A 
... a room that would give dear Mr. Anderson nightmares. A man in a white smock is packaging poached rhino horns into boxes. The boxes, labelled medical supplies, are being sent to addresses in China. 
On another wall, in front of a bank of telephones, is a dry-erase board covered with animal names, and their respective prices. 
STRASSER See what our friends in China will give us for a Bengal tiger, Garth. 
Strasser hands Garth the photo of the tiger. 
GARTH Looks like a big fellah. (excited, looking at photo) I'll set a new record with you. 
Strasser picks up one of the phones.   He idly plays with a rhino horn as he talks to Pindi. 
STRASSER Strasser. 
PINDI (O.S.) It's about time already! You know how long I am waiting? A man can only carry so much change... 
STRASSER (irritated) What do you want, Pindi?

35B   EXT. VILLAGE - SUNSET                                          35B 
A small street of stores -- all covered in brightly- painted advertisements. Outside one store is a lone pay phone -- manned by Pindi. Pindi speaks furtively, so as not to be overheard. INTERCUT conversation.

PINDI Not what I want, boss, what you want. How about a giant gorilla? 
STRASSER Talk. 
PINDI Big as three men, two thousand pounds, at least. 
STRASSER You've been drinking, haven't you? 
PINDI Swear to God, boss. Saw him with my own two eyes. 
STRASSER Don't waste my time again.

There is a CLICK on the LINE.

PINDI Hello?   Boss... 
Now a DIAL TONE.      Pindi looks at the phone. 
PINDI I'll catch him and charge you double, madar chode. 
Pindi smashes the phone down on its cradle. 
CUT TO: 
36    EXT. VILLAGE - MORNING                                             36 
In the center of the village, two trucks of rough-looking men are gassing up their vehicles. A third truck arrives from the other direction. 
It's a POACHER we recognize, one of Pindi's men, accompanied by a half dozen others, all armed with rifles. 
ANGLE ON JILL 
She steps out in front of the Poacher's truck. The driver SLAMS on the BRAKES, stopping within an inch of striking her. Alarmed, the Poacher stands in his seat and screams at Jill. 
POACHER Stupid girl! What do you think you're doing? 
Jill calmly walks up to the Poacher's side of the vehicle. 
JILL I found this in the forest this morning. Thought maybe you dropped it and might want it back. 
With that, Jill brazenly steps forward and throws a net over his head. It's a poacher's net. 
Enraged, the Poacher slowly pulls the net off his head. The other poachers find the scene hilarious. It infuriates Jill. 
JILL Poaching is illegal!   Get off this mountain! 
(CONTINUED) 
36    CONTINUED:                                                      36 
The Poacher and his driver exchange a significant look. Nodding to each other, they start to climb out of their truck, eyes glaring at Jill... 
KWELI (O.S.) Jill!   Jill Young! 
GREGG You're not a very trusting soul are you, Miss Young? 
JILL No, I'm not. 
GREGG (sarcastic) Tough, isn't it? Trying to measure me up -- decide if I'm a fraud... 
JILL ... or a fool. 
Gregg smiles, half sour, half amused. 
GREGG Well, I'd like to know if you're a bona fide lunatic or just a mixed up monkey girl but -- but I guess we'll have to take our chances and figure it out as we go along. 
Jill snorts.    Gregg looks her straight in the eye.

GREGG Come on, Jill. Trust it.      You'll be in charge of Joe. (extends hand) Let's shake on it. 
JILL I don't shake. That's not how we make pacts around here. 
GREGG (growing impatient) Alright, how do you make pacts around here? 
JILL You have to endure a bite from a Makiki spider. 
GREGG A what? 
JILL You'll have a high fever and hallucinations. You'll say things -- lots of things. We'll hear what's in your heart. Then, if your intentions prove true, the pact is made. 
Gregg nods to himself, considering. 
GREGG A spider bite and hallucinations? 
JILL That's right. 
GREGG Then you'll trust me and let me have Joe? 
JILL That's right.    Well? 
Gregg cocks his head. 
GREGG Well... I think... that's the biggest load of crap I've ever heard. 
Jill smiles. She's satisfied.         This is the answer she was looking for.

JILL Good. Maybe you're not a fool after all. 
Gregg scoffs, realizing she was only testing him. Jill turns and starts walking away. Gregg calls after her. 
GREGG Get your things together. Fast. We're getting out of here as soon as we can. 
Gregg watches her go, head held high like a queen. He chuckles to himself. It's hard not to appreciate this girl. 
GREGG (to himself) Makiki spider. 
39   EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - MOVING - DAY                              39 
Jill bursts INTO FRAME -- racing at full stride, long hair flowing -- so reminiscent of that little girl we saw before -- a wild mixture of fluid grace and strength. The trees seem to fly apart behind her revealing Joe -- running with her. As if speed alone could make their enemies disappear. 
40   EXT. MEADOW - DAY                                               40 
Jill watches the clouds rush by the mountaintop. Joe stands next to her, looking out at the mountain valley where they've grown up together. 
Wind sweeps down from the peak. The trees bow and bend gracefully. To Jill, the mountain has never seemed more beautiful. She looks at Joe -- magnificent against the natural tableau of his world. She looks at him, worry on her face about what is about to happen to him. 
He looks at her trying to understand. 
JILL I don't know what else to do. 
CRANE UP so we can see Joe and Jill against the Edenic mountain vista. 42D. 
40A   EXT. WILDLIFE CONSERVANCY - MOUNTAIN TOP - MORNING           40A 
Backlit against a blue sky. PAN DOWN as the wind RUSTLES the TREES and a flock of small birds appear and disappear like a storm cloud. CONTINUE DOWN PAST a waterfall, as we COME TO a grassy field, then a moat, then, finally, a railing at the edge of an observation area.

NOW REVEAL 
That what we are looking at is not, in fact, the African landscape, but rather a fabricated habitat, encircled by a sprawling campus of stucco buildings. 
Workers in matching uniforms with the "CALIFORNIA ANIMAL CONSERVANCY" logo on them, run back and forth, a hive of activity in anticipation of the new arrival. 
PULL IN ON two of them, walking and talking: DR. HARRY RUBEN, the Conservancy's Director and Chief Zoologist, and DR. CECILY BANKS, an African-American veterinarian with long braids stuffed under a baseball cap. 
HARRY This is crazy. All I said was, 'Bring back some blood samples.' So what does he bring back? A giant gorilla. 
CECILY Don't even pretend to be upset, Harry. 
HARRY You know how much it cost to convert the tiger habitat? Try half our operating budget. 
CECILY You'll be on the cover of National Geographic, Harry. 
HARRY Hey, I just said it was crazy.    I didn't say it wasn't worth it. 
They continue walking, and we...

CONSERVANCY CAR 
pulls up right in front of them.         Gregg gets out first. 
HARRY I'm confused, O'Hara. You phone us to say you're bringing back a two thousand pound wild animal... 
GREGG Hello, Harry.     Cecily. 
CECILY (affectionate) Welcome back, baby. 
HARRY ... but security tells me you've requested no firehoses, no restraints of any kind... 
GREGG Let me introduce you to... 
HARRY How are we supposed to control the animal? With a giant, rolled-up... 
Harry trails off as Jill gets out of the car. 
HARRY ... newspaper? 
Harry wasn't prepared for somebody this young and beautiful. Neither was Cecily. They raise their eyebrows at Gregg. 
GREGG Jill Young, Dr. Harry Ruben -- he run the place -- and Dr. Cecily Banks, who makes sure he doesn't screw it up. 
CECILY (chuckles) Chief veterinarian. Hi. 
Jill steps forward, shy and polite.        She extends her hand. 
JILL Hello. It's a privilege to meet you both.

Harry is too flustered by Jill to say a word. He just manages a weird little smile and a sound that's not English. 
Just then, a BANG and a loud GROWL come out of the trailer. Harry and Cecily almost jump out of their skins. 
JILL Coming, Joe! Hold on! (to Harry) I think he'd like to come out now -- if you don't mind. 
HARRY (stammering, scared) Mind?    No, of course I don't mind. 
Jill and Gregg look at each other, excited. This is the moment they've been waiting for. They grin at each other. 
GREGG Harry?   I think it's time you met Joe. 
They start moving to the trailer... 
HARRY Hold it! 
Harry whirls around and waves over a pair of nerdy, grad- school-geek conservancy workers, JACK and VERN. They run eagerly forward to take orders. They gawk at Jill, each one instantly deciding she is the woman of their dreams. Harry barks at them, bringing them back to attention. 
HARRY Jack? Vern?    Get the sedatives ready. 
JILL (quickly) We won't need any of that. 
HARRY Miss Young, we know what we're doing here, and the best way to... 
Gregg steps forward. 
GREGG Harry -- you and I made an agreement. The lady's in charge of Joe. 
50   EXT. BACK OF TRAILER                                            50 
Jack and Vern nervously raise the gate to the back of the trailer. The gate lays flat against a retractable plank that creates a bridge to the habitat. 
JOE GROWLS SOFTLY from inside. 
JACK Easy, big boy. 
VERN Don't forget who's gonna feed you. 
They raise the gate completely.    Jill comes up behind them. 
JILL I'll take it from here. 
Jack and Vern are only too happy to let Jill take over. 
JOE'S POV - FROM TRAILER DOOR 
He can hear Jill but sees only her silhouette at first... and the lush greenery behind her. He GROWLS... 
The entire staff, other than Gregg, takes one step back- ward. Harry whispers in his ear. 
HARRY You sure she knows what she's doing? 
Gregg's watching Jill with quiet admiration. 
GREGG She knows. 
BACK BY TRAILER 
Jill keeps coaxing Joe. 
JILL Come on, Joe.     Come on, big guy. 
SHADOW 
passes over the staff of the conservancy. A look of absolute wonderment on every face as Joe emerges from the trailer. Cecily nudges Harry, whose jaw is slack. Gregg sees this reaction, and beams.

Joe takes a step forward. He looks out across the plat- form into the sanctuary -- taking in the familiar trees and flowers the staff has planted for him. 
61   EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - CONTINUOUS ACTION                       61 
An exhausted Harry catches his breath at the gate around the habitat. Baker has a thoughtful look on his face. 
BAKER Put that girl in charge of the gorilla, Harry. 
HARRY What? Elliot, she's got no scientific... 
BAKER That ape is the best fund-raising tool this conservancy has ever seen. He's happy -- I'm happy. Put her on the payroll. 
Baker turns and walks away. 
62   EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - CONTINUOUS ACTION                       62 
Gregg and Cecily watch as Jill plays hide and seek with Joe. 
Jill dashes away and runs over to Gregg. She is absolutely glowing, bouncing around with happiness.   She grabs both his arms, jumping up and down. 
JILL He's playing!    Did you see? 
GREGG (laughing) I saw. 
JILL He likes it here! Isn't it great? 
GREGG It's great. 
Jill surprises Gregg by giving him a hug. Gregg looks over her shoulder and sees that Joe is giving him the evil eye. He's jealous. Gregg stares back, equally challenging. 
Jill, unaware of the competition, lets go of Gregg and happily runs back to Joe. Gregg and Joe continue to hold each other's eyes. Cecily sighs and shakes her head. 
CECILY Sorry, babe, but in a pissing match the monkey kicks your ass.

GREGG What are you talking about? 
CECILY Oh please. I was wondering why you hadn't taken off yet. Normally, you're out the door soon as the animal's in his habitat. 
GREGG You've got an active imagination, Cecily. 
CECILY I don't think so. I think Mr. World Traveller has goo-goo eyes for the gorilla girl. 
Gregg scoffs. But from the look on his face, it's clear she's hit a nerve. 
63   INT. JILL'S APARTMENT - DAY                                      63 
A KNOCK at Jill's apartment door. She opens it and lights up to see Gregg standing there. Gregg looks past her into the room. She's made some changes; the bed's on the floor and a few large potted ferns crowd the room. 
GREGG Like what you've done with the place. 
JILL Too bad it's always so cold -- somebody broke my window. 
She smiles at him and motions for him to come in.     Gregg steps just inside the door and stops. 
GREGG I just came by to tell you that I think Joe looks real good out there... 
JILL I know! This is working out -- better than I expected. 
GREGG ... and that I'm hitting the road. 
Jill looks at Gregg keenly.    He's acting like he's got something to tell her.

JILL Where you going? 
GREGG Back to Africa. (pauses) For a couple of months. 
Jill stays light. 
JILL No kidding?   When do you leave? 
GREGG Now. 
Jill just nods. 
Gregg is struggling -- this is more difficult than it's ever been for him. He tries to be nonchalant... 
GREGG It's the job, y'know. Always on the road. It's what I like, anyway -- can't stand to be caged up... 
They meet eyes.      They both know what that means. 
GREGG You and Joe will be okay... 
Jill shrugs, acting like she doesn't care either. 
JILL Oh -- of course. 
GREGG Yeah.   Well... 
JILL                         GREGG (overlapping)                    (overlapping) See you when you get back.           I'll call you. 63A.

Gregg turns and heads back down the hall.    Jill sticks her head out and calls after him. 
JILL (biting) Say hello to Africa for me. 
She slams the door to her apartment. Gregg freezes for a moment, then continues down the hallway alone. 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN:

JILL Harry -- see what's in that cart? That's all we have left of the lobelia leaves for Joe. Did you by any chance place that new order I asked for?

HARRY I'll go rush order it for you now. 
JILL (beaming) Thank you so much. 
Cecily rolls her eyes.     Jill winks at her conspiratorially. 
CECILY (to Harry) She's nice. I'm not. If you forget to order something I need, I'll knock you upside the head. 
Cecily and Harry walk off grumbling at each other like an old married couple. 
HARRY I keep telling you -- stop talking to me like that. 
CECILY Please.   You love it. 
Jill smiles to herself. She turns to get back to her other business, and almost walks right into: 
Gregg. He's been leaning against a wall, and he's caught the whole thing. 
GREGG Lobelia leaves. Should have called me in Africa. I would have brought 'em back for ya. 
Jill just stares for a moment, trying to decide how to handle Gregg's sudden reappearnce. His clothes look travelled in, and another month in Africa has put a deeper shade of brown on his face. He's got the ragged look of someone who's just gotten off a 16-hour flight. 
GREGG Nice to see you running the place, Jill. 
Jill nods and starts walking like someone with urgent business to attend to. Gregg falls in beside her. 
JILL You're back early. What happened? Run out of humvees to crash?

GREGG No -- just wanted to get back. 
JILL (frosty) Really? And why is that? 
GREGG Guess I missed Harry. 
Gregg smiles teasingly at Jill but she's in no mood to melt that easily. He continues. 
GREGG They want me to show my face at the fundraiser tomorrow night... and I guess I got my mind fixed on a good meal in a fine restaurant. Thought you might like to join me. 
JILL (cool) No thanks. I still don't want to leave Joe. 
GREGG 'Still'? Haven't you been out of here yet? 
JILL (flip) What's to see? Beach is that way, mountains are that way, Mexico's that way, Canada's that way... 
Gregg reaches out and slows her down.    He wants to see her eyes. 
GREGG Come on. Have dinner with me, Jill. (tenderly) You won't find a better excuse to brush your hair. 
Gregg reaches out and pulls a piece of straw from Jill's tossled locks. She can't help herself anymore -- and breaks into a slow smile. 
JILL I'll brush my hair if you take a shower. 
GREGG (grins) Deal. 
68B   EXT. OUTSIDE JOE'S HABITAT - DAY                              68B 
Garth walks quickly -- but not fast enough to draw attention. He moves along the handrail at the edge of the moat. Takes off his sunglasses and looks for Joe. 
GARTH'S POV - JOE 
is moving slowly among saplings. 
CLOSE ON GARTH'S HAND 
as he reaches in his pocket and pulls out one of the poaching dog collars. Garth looks around -- then gives the metal clappers one loud shake -- quickly drops them back into his pocket. 
Joe reacts immediately to the JANGLING sound. Imprinted deep in his memory. He rises up quickly and GROWLS furiously -- pounding his chest -- looking around for the danger. It's instinctive and frightening. Joe sees Garth and charges him. Joe's anger takes him into the electrified wire around the habitat. JOE ROARS at the shock and recoils. 
GARTH You remember, don't you?

It's a beautiful and lively night on Venice Beach. A few people have made bonfires along the water's edge, and the MUSIC of a DISTANT bar band wafts through the air. It's a magic night. 
Gregg and Jill walk away from a funky food shack, festooned with tiny lights. They share a carton of fish and chips. 
JILL So this is what you call a good meal in a fine restaurant? 
GREGG (thinks about it) Yeah. 
Gregg grins at Jill, all boyish charm. She stiffles a smile, struggling to hold on to her pervious indignation.

JILL Don't point that smile at me. I'm still mad at you for taking off and leaving me here all alone. 
GREGG (guilty) I'm sorry -- I had things I had to do... 
JILL (doesn't buy it) Uh-huh... 
GREGG Besides, you weren't all alone. You had Joe. 
As Strasser and Garth leave, Joe looks after them, beside himself with fury. Outraged, he turns this way and that way, finally focusing on a tall tree in his habitat. 
78   INT. TENT - NIGHT                                              78 
At the podium, Baker is making his presentation to the tony crowd. 
BAKER ... and now to introduce our remarkable new acquisition, I would like to bring up to the podium the director of the conservancy... 
A sudden ROAR coming from behind the curtain drowns out Baker's voice. The audience members jump in their seats, frightened. Baker is rattled, too, then regains his composure. 
BAKER Well! I suppose there's no need to add to that introduction. 
The audience laughs and relaxes. 
BAKER Here's Dr. Harry Ruben. 
Baker motions to Harry, who freezes with a sudden bout of stage fright. Cecily gives him a discreet push on the back and he stumbles forward. 
JOE can still be heard GROWLING and beating his chest in the background. Jill and Gregg look at each other with mounting anxiety. 
Harry reaches the mic. 
HARRY (into mic) In the time it took you to drive here tonight, three species have disappeared from the Earth. Extinct. Never to return. We here at the conservancy say this is a tragedy... 
Another O.S. ROAR from JOE. It is spine-tingling.    Harry almost jumps out of his loafers. 
HARRY (nervous joke) Obviously Joe agrees. 
Everybody laughs. The audience doesn't know enough to be really afraid -- they're just excited and twittering.

Jill is feeling increasingly nervous. She glances around the room and meets eyes with Strasser. He nods at her, his eyes indicating that he is "worried" for Joe as well. Jill nods back. 
We continue to hear uncanny SOUNDS from behind the curtain. It's all Harry can do to stick to his speech. He keeps glancing nervously over his shoulder. 
HARRY But tonight, rather than focusing on what we've lost, I'm going to introduce you to something we've found. 
There is a tremendous CRACKING sound from behind the curtain. The audience murmurs. Harry sweats. Jill grabs Gregg's hand tightly. 
HARRY Ladies and gentlemen, the California Animal Conservancy proudly introduces our newest member, Mighty Joe... 
CRASH! Before Harry can say "Young," a TREE comes CRASHING through the curtain. 
Gregg leaps forward, knocking Harry out of the way just as the tree crushes the podium into kindling. 
Joe comes blasting through the hole in the curtain.    He has joined the party. 
Joe stands on the stage, his chest heaving. There is total silence. The party guests are frozen with fear, literally speechless. A few of them laugh nervously, wondering if this is really just part of the show. 
But Jill knows better. She and Gregg exchange glances -- what the hell is going on? 
Jill rises, trying to stay calm herself, and slowly approaches Joe, speaking in a soothing voice. She wants to get his attention. 
JILL (soothing) Hey, Joe. I'm right here. You hear me? Good boy. Take it easy, Joe. We don't want to scare anybody, do we? 
(CONTINUED)

Jill is within arm's reach of Joe -- it looks like he might turn his head to her, calm down, become docile... 
But that's when he spots Strasser. Joe's face registers towering rage as Strasser stares back, provoking Joe further. 
Joe takes off, knocking over a table that bangs into Jill and sends her flying backwards into a wall. She hits the wall and sinks down, stunned. 
JOE 
heads through the people towards Strasser.        The party erupts with screams. 
Joe makes his way towards Strasser, swatting people out of the way. 
ON STRASSER 
Frozen, in horror, as Joe plows through the party, heading straight for him. Tables are broken like match sticks, GLASS SHATTERS. 
Joe catches up to Strasser, grabs his tuxedo jacket and hoists him into the air. 
CLOSE ON MAN 
It's not Strasser. Frustrated, Joe flings him aside. The man flies through the air, slamming into the tent wall, and then falling on the catering table. 
ON GREGG AND JILL 
As they watch Joe's rampage in horror. 
JILL My God.   What's wrong with him? 
GREGG We've got to bring him down.   I'm going for the tranq guns. 
JILL No -- let me stop him. 
(CONTINUED) 
78   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             78 
But Gregg's already taken off. 
MEANWHILE 
Mighty Joe is still looking for Strasser, as he heads back across the room. 
A glamorous couple, (TERRY and RAY), crawls frantically on all fours, trying to stay ahead of Joe. 
TERRY (frantic) Faster! Faster! 
RAY I'm trying! 
HARRY Can I talk to you for a second? 
Jill nods. She takes one last look at Joe, then walks out of the room, leaving... 
Gregg, alone with Joe for the first time since Joe held him upside down in the jungle. 
Gregg leans against the cage next to Joe. They have never been in such close proximity before. The expressive-ness in Joe's eyes is uncanny -- Gregg feels almost as if he could understand what he's saying. 
GREGG (deeply sorry) Well this wasn't in the brochure, was it? 
Gregg looks around at the claustrophobic space. 
GREGG I promised you wouldn't be put in a cage. I'm sorry, Joe. I helped put you here. And now I'm going to do everything I can to get you out. 
Gregg reaches out for Joe's paw and lays his hand in it. Joe gently curls his fingers around Gregg's hand. 
83   EXT. OBSERVATION AREA - BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ACTION             83 
Jill and Harry are in the observation area, a glassed-off room that looks into the holding cell. Harry is still extremely rattled from the fiasco of the night before. He's trying to act tough but he's torn up inside, not sure who he's worried about more -- Joe or himself. 
HARRY The City Attorney talked to Baker. It wasn't my decision, and there's nothing I can do about it. 
JILL About what? 
HARRY Joe stays in there until they decide what to do with him. 
JILL (freaking out) In there? Harry, look at him. He's depressed, he won't eat. If he stays in there, he'll die within days. 
HARRY So sue me.    Everybody else is. 
JILL Listen, Harry, either you tell them you're getting Joe out of there or I will! 
HARRY Don't you get it? This is way beyond you, and me. Joe freaked out on some very influential people. He's a public relations nightmare. No zoo will take a two-thousand-pound killer gorilla... 
JILL (interrupting) He's not a killer! 
HARRY ... and unless you can write a check for millions of dollars to buy him a big back yard somewhere, Joe's got nowhere to go. 
JILL That's it?    You're not going to do anything? 
(CONTINUED) 
83   CONTINUED:                                                     83 
Harry looks at Jill's angry face -- he knows he's just lost her respect and it bugs him more than he'd like to admit. But there's nothing more he can say. 
He leaves the room, brushing shoulders with Gregg, entering. Judging from the expression on Gregg's face, he's overheard the whole thing. 
Jill and Gregg look at each other with determination in their eyes. There's no question in either of their minds about what needs to be done next. 
JILL I need your help. 
GREGG You got it. 
84   EXT. BUNKER - NIGHT                                            84 
An ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER stands guard outside the bunker. 
Gregg, Cecily, and Jill walk casually towards the Officer. The Officer straightens up and looks tough. He comes forward halfway to meet them. 
CECILY (big smile) Good evening. 
A.C. OFFICER 'Evening. 
Our three just breeze on by the Officer into the bunker. 
A.C. OFFICER Hey, wait a minute! 
Gregg hangs back with the A.C. Officer as Cecily and Jill disappear inside. To buy time for Cecily and Jill, Gregg pretends to take the big lug into his confidences. 
GREGG (confidential) We're conservancy doctors. Do me a favor -- stay here and guard the door. 
The guard nods and looks confused.    Gregg disappears inside. 
85   INT. BUNKER - AT CAGE                                        85 
Cecily takes a key from her pocket and opens the door to Joe's cage. 
JILL Come on, Joe. We're leaving. Let's get you out of here. 
The open door has a stronger effect on Joe than the sedatives in his system. He clambers to his feet and follows Jill out of the cage. 
(CONTINUED) 
85   CONTINUED:                                                     85 
A.C. OFFICER (O.S.) What the hell are you doing? 
They turn to see the Officer has a rifle aimed at Joe. He's terrified. JOE GROWLS ominously. 
CECILY I'm Dr. Banks, the head vet. And I'm taking Joe for a CAT Scan. 
A.C. OFFICER I take my orders from Mr. Baker. Put him back in the cage. Now. 
The Officer trains his gun on Joe. Joe looks at the Officer menacingly and bares his huge fangs. 
GREGG (friendly voice) Officer, you don't want to point that gun at him, believe me. 
The Officer suddenly grabs his neck, which now has a tranquilizer dart sticking out of it. 
Jill lowers a tranq gun. 
JILL (simply) He didn't believe you. 
The Officer slumps to the ground. 
86   EXT. BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ACTION                                86 
Cecily steps out of the bunker and blinks a flashlight into the dark. 
FOLLOW Joe DOWN the boulevard, as he moves in a four- point walk through the intersection and along the boulevard. 
Two women coming out of a shop see Joe and scream -- that frightens Joe and makes him bare his fangs. Which only makes matters worse. He feints a charge -- and one woman collapses. 
JOE'S POV 
It is indeed an urban jungle -- made up of neon and steel. 
ANGLE 
Joe walks down the street and bumps into: 
PARKED MERCEDES 
Whose ALARM GOES OFF immediately.   Joe wheels and smashes the car until the sound STOPS. 
CLOSE ON JOE 
The lights and loud VOICES blend into one single tumult -- dangerous and threatening. 
The sounds of SIRENS tell us the police are coming fast -- a block away we see two BLACK & WHITES SCREECH INTO VIEW. 
THROUGH the crowd we see a street kid, RAY, 13, come face- to-face with Joe. His eyes go wide with the wonder of Joe. 
RAY Whoa... Hey, Joe! 
It's as if he's seeing a completely different animal than everyone else around him. It's a look we've seen in young Jill's eyes. 
Ray looks down the street at the approaching cop cars and back at Joe. He understands the danger. 
Ray points the right way for Joe to go, away from the police cars. Joe watches Ray closely, as if he were studying the boy's face. Then he moves off in the direction Ray was pointing, towards: 
101   EXT. MANN'S CHINESE THEATER - NIGHT                            101 
Where patrons hang fearfully by the doors.   Theatergoers rush back inside. 
CLOSE ON IMPRINTS 
for John Travolta and Donald Duck -- As an enormous gorilla foot descends on them. They split down the middle, then crumble into dust. 
INSIDE TICKET KIOSK 
A Mexican-American female ticket-taker hyperventilates, boxed in her tiny glass booth. From HER POV, Joe ducks down and stares at her, bringing his giant face close to the glass. She is speechless with fright. Joe moves on. 
Now the sounds of POLICE SIRENS can be heard APPROACHING. FIND Joe -- boxed in by the movie theater. Angry. He starts searching for a way out... 
ANGLE - STREET 
Just then -- two LAPD cars pull up.   COPS jump out.    They spot Joe... 
COP Up there! 
The Cop points up to... 
102   EXT. TOP OF MANN'S CHINESE                                     102 
Joe uses his powerful muscles to scale the theater.     He makes it to the top -- high over Hollywood. 
Behind him are hills and trees.   Something familiar. 
BACK ON COPS 
They've got their guns aimed, but Joe disappears over the top of the theater. 
CUT TO: 
103   EXT. BOULEVARD - GREGG'S CAR                                   103 
Gregg and Jill pull up to the overturned trailer, see the wreckage... but no sign of Joe. Stunned, they whirl around, hoping he'll still be somewhere in sight... 
(CONTINUED) 
103   CONTINUED:                                                       103 
GREGG He couldn't have gotten far. 
Jill is overwhelmed with frustration. In seconds, she climbs on top of the overturned can and screams at the top of her lungs: 
JILL (screaming) Joe!   Joe! 
Gregg sees a group of EXCITED NEIGHBORS run down the street towards Mann's Chinese screaming to each other: 
EXCITED NEIGHBORS This way! 
Jill hops down and she and Gregg tear off down the street towards the gathered crowd at the Chinese Theater. 
CUT TO: 
104   EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN                                              104

PUSH IN CLOSE ON the "O."     A shadow moves across the opening. 
CLOSER 
beat -- then Joe steps through.     He's at the apex of the urban mountain range. 
JOE'S POV - WEST 
A beam of light is sweeping back and forth across the night sky. 
JOE 
PUSH IN CLOSE ON JOE -- he GROWLS as if he recognizes it. From this distance it looks like a flashlight beam. In Joe's mind it means only one thing -- Jill. He ROARS -- and moves off across the hill. 
CUT TO:

It's almost like church. The freeway becomes quiet. Nobody honks. Nobody screams. 
Overcome with awe, a woman steps out of her car and just stands there in the middle of the freeway, watching Joe pass. Others follow suit. 
Joe climbs the center divider.    The same thing happens in the southbound lane. 
As Joe disappears up the hill on the other side, the stunned drivers simply stare in disbelief. L.A. is in awe. 
113   OMITTED                                                         113 
114   INT. CONSERVANCY VEHICLE (FREEWAY OVERPASS)                     114 
Gregg and Jill arrive on the scene. 
They look down from the overpass and see cops swarming around the area where Joe was, shining their flashlights into the brush and talking to motorists. 
GREGG Any idea where he might've headed? 
ON JILL -- drifting off, as something O.S. catches her attention. 
JILL Look. 
She points out THROUGH the windshield. 
LONG SHOT - JILL'S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD 
Shining over the horizon, coming from somewhere near the ocean, is a searchlight, piercing the night sky. The image is as familiar to Jill as it was to Joe. 
BACK TO SCENE 
JILL That's where he'll go. He'll think that's me calling him. 
Gregg steps on the accelerator. As their car pulls away, PAN TO Strasser and Garth following a few car lengths behind.

A festival of lights.   Rides, arcades, lots of people. 
CLOSE ON SEARCHLIGHT 
A kettle light rotating on its base. CAMERA CRANES UP THROUGH the klieg beams REVEALING the park -- CONTINUE TO CRANE UP 'til we see, towering over everything, the new Ferris wheel -- a neon blur spinning grandly against the moon-bright sky. 
118   EXT. PALISADES OCEAN PARK - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT                118 
Quintessentially American images of beach-side amusement park. A carnival-like atmosphere. 
ANGLE - ARCHWAY ENTRANCE 
Some couples stop to take their photos, kissing under the iconic neon arch that welcomes people to the park. 
YOUNG COUPLE 
stops to share the view -- and a kiss.   Until a LOUD GROWL makes them jump back. 
Joe has appeared under the arch. The young girl screams -- her boyfriend pulls her back. 
JOE'S POV 
It's like a slow-motion panic. The noise and tumult of the crowded park keeps people from hearing the screams right away. 
One toddler smiles and waves at Joe until his mother snatches him and runs for dear life.

AT FERRIS WHEEL 
A crowd of kids waits in line. One of them, a particularly appealing little boy named JASON, is having a conversation with his MOTHER. She has the aura of a single mom about her, and she clearly adores her sweet-faced kid. 
JASON Mom, I don't think I can let you go on the ferris wheel. 
JASON'S MOTHER Why not? 
JASON Because the last time after you ate two hot dogs, you threw up, remember? 
JASON'S MOTHER What if I promised to throw up over the side? 
They both giggle at her joke. 
JASON Mom, I think I should do this ride by myself. 
JASON'S MOTHER (reluctant) Okay... I'll watch you. 
TILT UP TO the wheel turning majestically -- filled with kids. Some wave from the chairs as they crest -- it feels like they're flying over the ocean below. 
We NOTICE two girls (JENNY, seven, and EMMA, nine) as they come over the top. On the way down, they can see the crowd parting below as Joe ENTERS FRAME. 
At the base of the great wheel -- parents are finally hearing the commotion. 
BY LIGHT 
Joe arrives at his destination -- the bright light that drew him here. He's confused by the fact that Jill's nowhere to be found. Desperately, he scans the park... 
People scream and panic around Joe. The noise drives him deeper into the park, searching for Jill. Meanwhile --

JILL What was that? 
Then they spot the fire, spreading to the Ferris wheel. Gregg turns to Jill. 
GREGG Go find Joe, get him out of here. (looking towards the wheel) I'm gonna see if I can help. 
Gregg moves off towards the Ferris wheel. 
JILL 
heads over to the carnival games.

Strasser, calm and totally committed to his course of action moves through the pandemonium of the crowd, gun by his side. 
CUT TO: 
AT FERRIS WHEEL 
Parents are shouting, crowding the Ferris wheel. Two operators are unloading children as quickly as they can. 
They look like they are about to be overwhelmed but then... 
Gregg ENTERS FRAME. He vaults the guard rail, starts unloading children right from their moving cars. 
There is utter chaos, children screaming, fire and smoke. CRANE UP PAST the terrified faces of the children who have to wait, 'til we GET TO Jenny and Emma. Jenny turns to see the fire beneath them. 
(CONTINUED) 
124   CONTINUED:                                                       124 
FIRE 
is really starting to burn out of control now. It has spread to the engine of the FERRIS WHEEL, which, heated to the bursting point, suddenly EXPLODES. 
The ride operator with the fire extinguisher is blown through the air, and the Ferris wheel lurches to a halt. 
JENNY AND EMMA 
grip their safety bar as their bucket swings back and forth. Emma nearly falls out -- until Jenny grabs her and holds her tight. 
JENNY Mo-om!! 
JENNY'S MOTHER Oh my God!   Somebody help! 
Gregg -- sees the girls, their bucket having come to a stop about fifteen feet off the ground. Thinking quickly, he jumps up on the guard railing, then leaps across to their bucket. 
He just grabs onto the bottom. The bucket shakes back and forth violently, causing the two girls to scream. Gregg looks up at them. 
GREGG Don't be scared. Climb down my back. 
The girls look at Gregg, too nervous to move. 
GREGG Come on. 
Tentatively, Jenny and Emma climb out of their bucket and onto Gregg's back, using him like a human ladder. They shimmy down to his feet, then drop off, one by one, into the waiting arms of their mother. 
Gregg lets go of the bucket, drops a good fifteen feet, landing roughly. The girls' mother looks down at Gregg, thankfully. 
JENNY'S MOTHER Thank you!   Oh God, thank you! 
Gregg, winded, just nods. 
CUT TO: 
125   EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - PARKING LOT - NIGHT                         125 
A phalanx of cop cars races up to the park. 
126   EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NEAR CARNIVAL GAMES                         126 
Jill moves through the maze of carnival games. She spots Joe, moving through the small buildings, clearly disoriented. She yells out... 
JILL Joe!   Joe!! 
But above the tumult, he can't hear her. Jill pushes her way towards him, when she comes face to face with... 
Strasser. Just yards away.      He flashes his sickening smile, raises his gun... 
ON JILL -- a look of terror crossing her face as she realizes she's about to die. Then, as a shadow passes over her, her expression of terror melts away. 
ON STRASSER -- seeing Jill's expression, his smile fades. Why's she so calm all of a sudden? He doesn't even need to turn around to know that: 
Joe is behind him. As Strasser turns slowly around, Joe reaches down swiftly and hoists Strasser off the ground. The GUN GOES OFF, barely missing Joe. JOE ROARS and crushes Strasser's left hand in his paw, a bone-crunching, slow squeeze that makes Strasser scream in agony. 
Then Joe swings Strasser around and grabs him around the chest with his right paw. He pulls him close to his face and blasts a DEAFENING ROAR into his face. Joe cocks his arm and heaves Strasser with mighty force into the air. 
Screaming, Strasser hurtles through space with incredible speed, CRASHING right through the flaming signage of the "Big Safari" booth, sending out a SHOWER OF SPARKS... 
... and continues flying through the air until WHACK!      He hangs up on a power line. 
Strasser slips down, catching his fall with his fake hand. This section of the LINE is safe, but directly below it is a cluster of electrical junction boxes. Cracked and blistered by the heat of the nearby fire, they are sparking dangerously -- to fall on to them would mean certain electrocution.

Strasser's bad hand begins to slip from the wire. Desperate, he reaches up with his left hand to grab on -- only to remember that this hand has just been crushed by Joe, and is useless to him now. 
Strasser helplessly watches as his prosthetic comes unclasped from his hand and he slips the last, fatal fraction of an inch. 
Strasser falls onto the junction boxes, which explode in a shower of sparks. Strasser sizzles and dies, while above him, the prosthesis still swings on the wire. 
127   EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS ACTION                                   127 
Jill stands where she is, frozen at the horrible sight of what has just happened. A dozen people scream and recoil. 
ON GROUND 
All eyes watch, in awe, as Joe presses Jason to his massive chest. 
ON JILL -- smiling through tears.    Gregg puts an arm around her. 
BEHIND THEM 
Camera crews from local TV news stations have poured into the park. They film all of this. 
AT BASE OF WHEEL 
The wood attached to the metal supports has completely burned through. With a terrible CRACKING sound, the SUPPORTS begin to tear away. 
Another EXPLOSION rocks the WHEEL.   It SHUDDERS. 
JASON'S MOTHER Oh, please, no... 
WIDEN SHOT -- The Ferris wheel begins to tip over. 
ON JILL -- a look of horror passes over her face as well. 
GREGG It's going to tip! Everyone back up! 
Everyone starts backing away from the wheel. 
The wheel seems to fall slowly -- like in a dream -- sending debris and flames spilling across the park. 
ON JOE 
As he cradles Jason tight in his arms. 
The wheel begins to fall towards the ground.

As the ground comes rushing up at him. 
JOE 
hits hard, just clearing the falling wheel by inches.    He doesn't move. 
PAN the crowd -- an eerie silence falls over everyone. The only sound the CRACKLING of the FIRE. 
JILL 
breaks free from Gregg and runs toward Joe.   Jason's Mother races with her. 
ON JOE 
Motionless on his back. Still cupping the boy, nestled and protected against his massive chest. A beat -- then Jason looks up from Joe -- 
JASON Mom? 
Jason's Mother bursts into joyous sobs as her son climbs into her arms. A general sense of relief passes through the crowd, except for... 
JILL 
She kneels by Joe stroking his great chest. Joe doesn't respond. Jill bows her head and cries deeply. 
People back away to give her room. How strange to see this huge, powerful animal stilled. 
Gregg comes and kneels by Joe's side. He checks for a heart beat. For wounds. Joe doesn't stir. Gregg is devastated, too. 
PAN CROWD... 
Firemen, paramedics and television reporters run through the park. The paramedics lead off the wounded.

Still holding her boy, Jason's Mother comes forward. She recognizes what Jill is going through her own version of mother's grief. She approaches respectfully... 
JASON'S MOTHER I'm so sorry... 
Jill is beyond comfort. She's in another world. Humming their lullaby, she rests her soft cheek in Joe's giant paw for the last time. Her blonde hair spills on his fingers... 
And then, SLOWLY ENTERING FRAME, a giant finger reaches for Jill's cheek and strokes it gently... 
It takes Jill a moment to realize she hasn't imagined this... she opens her eyes, sees the moving fingers, turns to look into Joe's face, just as his eyes open... 
Elated, Jill moves up to Joe's head and kisses his face a thousand times. Gregg takes a deep breath, privately thanking God. Jason's Mother is tearful -- Jason is all smiles. 
Jill tearfully blathers soothing words... 
JILL (kissing Joe's head) That's right, Joe -- that's right, big guy. That was a big fall but you're okay, aren't you? You're tough. You're so tough. Yes you are. Yes you are. 
GREGG (checking Joe over) We've got to get him checked out. (looking around at crowd) And get him somewhere safe. 
Jill looks at Gregg with a heavy heart. 
JILL (bitter/rhetorical) Somewhere safe? Where is that? 
Jason's Mother breaks in timidly.

JASON'S MOTHER (stammering) Perhaps... I mean, maybe... isn't there anything we can do? 
Jason pushes in front of his mother. He reaches out his little hand and pets Joe. He looks up at Jill and Gregg with a shining face and smiles hopefully.

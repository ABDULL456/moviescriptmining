FINAL DRAFT 2nd Revision March 2, 1962 
FADE IN: 
FULL SHOT - GRANT STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY 
It is mid-afternoon, and there is a tempo and pace to the people walking, the doorman HOOTING for taxicabs, the policemen directing traffic. 
PAN SHOT - PEDESTRIANS 
waiting at street corner for light to change. 
CLOSE SHOT - MAN 
at the end of line of pedestrians. He is looking up at the sky. 
TWO SHOT - MAN AND WOMAN NEXT TO HIM 
as she follows his gaze upward. 
LONG SHOT - THE SKY 
with hundreds of gulls in it, wheeling. 
MED. SHOT - THE STREET CORNER 
as the light changes and people begin to cross. In the crowd walking the other way, a man turns to look up at the wheeling gulls in the sky overhead. The CAMERA LOCATES: 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELS 
in the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop. She is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed, exquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick sureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride, a mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the front door of a pet shop and enters. 
INT. BIRD SHOP - MED. SHOT 
Melanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back toward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS. MacGRUDER, comes toward her. 
MELANIE Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls? 
MRS. MACGRUDER Hello, Miss Daniels. 
MELANIE What do you suppose it is? 
MED. SHOT 
Mrs. MacGruder takes a look out at the sky. A puppy is BARKING, o.s. 
MRS. MACGRUDER (shaking her head) There must be a storm at sea. That can drive them inland, you know. 
They are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird department now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor of innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie and Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end.  There is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained birds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic birds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages, larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets in the bigger cages. As they walk: 
MRS. MACGRUDER I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels. (apologetically) You see, he hasn't arrived yet. 
MELANIE You said three o'clock. 
MRS. MACGRUDER I know. Oh, I know. (she is more distressed now) I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to... 
MELANIE Well, this one won't be a chick, will he? 
MRS. MACGRUDER Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown. 
MELANIE And he'll talk? 
MRS. MACGRUDER Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk. 
MELANIE Yes. 
MRS. MACGRUDER Yes. (pause) Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock. (pause) Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting? 
MELANIE (judiciously) I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. (she begins taking off her gloves) 
MRS. MACGRUDER (producing pencil and pad) Oh. Oh, well, all right. 
As Melanie starts writing: 
MRS. MACGRUDER I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call? 
MELANIE (with a resigned sigh) Well, all right, but... 
She scurries out behind the counter and out of sight.  Melanie finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the counter. She taps her teeth with the pencil. 
MRS. MACGRUDER (O.S.) Hello, this is Betty MacGruder at Davidson's. (pause; accusingly) It's past three, you know. (pause) Well, how long do you think...? All right, would you check it please? Yes, I'll wait. 
Melanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips with the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding her. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the bars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins BARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up. 
MED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNER 
as he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the steps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about twenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt hat. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
seeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of strawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh. The birds are startled into scarlet flight. 
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH 
as they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little nod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner. 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE 
looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of the cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again. 
MITCH I wonder if you could help me. 
MELANIE What? 
MITCH (deliberately, and with a touch of hauteur) I said I wonder if you could help me. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
a trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea comes to her. 
MELANIE (solicitously) Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir? 
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH 
MITCH (deadpan) Lovebirds. 
MELANIE Lovebirds, sir? 
MITCH Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true? 
MITCH I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers. 
MELANIE What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical... 
MITCH Ahhh, but I really do want those birds. 
MELANIE You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately... 
MITCH Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels? 
MELANIE I think you're a louse. 
MITCH I am. (he tips his hat) Good day. (to Mrs. MacGruder) Madam. (and he goes down the steps) 
MELANIE And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds! 
MITCH (breezily, as he goes out) I'll find something else. (he gives a slight bow) See you in court some day. 
The door closes. The puppy begins BARKING. 
MELANIE (angrily) That... that... who was that? 
MRS. MACGRUDER I have no idea. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
seething as she stares after him. Suddenly, she gets an idea. 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE 
going down the steps and to the front door of the shop. She looks through the glass. 
LONG SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V. 
getting into his car at the curb. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
looking after the car at the curb. 
CLOSE SHOT - THE LICENSE PLATE CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
seeing the plate, giving a brief, determined, angry nod. She begins to repeat the numbers to herself as she turns. 
FULL SHOT - MELANIE 
as she comes up the steps again and walks toward the counter. 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE - MRS. MACGRUDER'S P.O.V. 
as she comes up to the counter. 
MELANIE Have you got a pencil? 
MRS. MACGRUDER What? Oh, yes, certainly. 
As Melanie begins writing: 
MRS. MACGRUDER They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back... 
MELANIE No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone? 
MRS. MACGRUDER (bewildered by everything) Yes, certainly. (she puts phone on counter) 
MELANIE (as she dials) Do you have any lovebirds? 
MRS. MACGRUDER No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you. 
MELANIE How soon? 
MRS. MACGRUDER Well... well, how soon would you want them? 
MELANIE Immediately. (into phone) Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please? 
MRS. MACGRUDER I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right? 
MELANIE (with an edged anger) That would be just fine. (into phone) Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me. (pause) No, this is a small one. (pause) Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six. (pause) Yes, a California plate. (pause) No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office? (pause) Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. (she hangs up) 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE ICY DETERMINATION ON HER FACE. 
MELANIE Now. What time tomorrow morning? 
FADE IN: 
FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S SPORTS CAR 
pulling up in front of Mitch's building, the top down. She glances up at the address, gets out of the car, comes around to the other side, and opens the door. 
CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS 
in a cage as Melanie reaches for them. 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE 
turning from the car and going into the building. She pauses in the lobby, studies the names alongside the bell buttons. 
CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND 
running down the list of names slowly. It stops. 
INSERT - THE CARD 
her finger beside it. 
BRENNER, M. 3B 
CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND the forefinger extended as she runs it down over every bell button in one column, and then does the same for the next column. 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE 
as she turns from the bells to the inner door of the lobby, grabbing the knob. A BUZZ SOUNDS. She opens the door. 
REVERSE SHOT - MELANIE 
coming through the door and into the lobby. She walks swiftly toward the elevator where a well-dressed man is standing, waiting. Behind her, the inner door is BUZZING wildly with answering BUZZES. Melanie and the man stand waiting for the elevator, silently. Behind her, the BUZZING STOPS. The elevator doors open. The man smiles pleasantly and allows her to enter first. She does so with a small nod.  The elevator doors close. 
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE MAN - IN THE ELEVATOR 
The birds are CHIRPING wildly in their cage. The man and Melanie stand silently side by side. The man's eyes wander down to the bird-cage. Melanie's eyes move toward him.  Self- consciously, she stands with the cage of CHATTERING birds. The man is dead-panned, unsmiling. The elevator stops. The doors begin to open. 
FULL SHOT - MELANIE 
stepping out of the elevator as the doors open. The man is right behind her. She begins looking for apartment 3B. The man is walking down the corridor beside her. She stops in front of the apartment, hesitates, hoping the man will turn the corner in the corridor. Instead, he stops at the apartment just opposite. He begins fumbling in his pocket for his key. He looks at Melanie. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
smiling at him feebly. 
FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR 
The man spread change and an assortment of junk on the palm of his hand as he searches for his key. Impatiently, Melanie watches him. Making a decision, she puts the birdcage down before the door to apartment 3B, and then opens her purse. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE'S GLOVED HAND 
FULL SHOT - THE CAR 
pulling in, in front of the post office. Melanie opens the door and steps out. She is smartly dressed in a traveling suit and sweater. She looks up at the sign, and then walks quickly toward the front door. 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE 
enters post office. 
CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK 
behind cage as Melanie approaches it. He is busy filling out a form of some kind, affixing stamps to it, etc. He does not look up as she approaches. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
through the bars of the cage. 
MELANIE Good morning. 
CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK 
CLERK (without looking up) Morning. 
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK 
MELANIE I wonder if you could help me. 
CLERK Try my best. 
MELANIE I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner. 
CLERK Yep. 
He is still busy with his form, still does not look up. 
MELANIE Do you know him? 
CLERK Yep. 
MELANIE Where does he live? 
CLERK Right here. Bodega Bay. 
MELANIE Yes, but where? 
CLERK Right across the bay there. 
MELANIE Where? 
It seems as if the Clerk will not answer her. Suddenly, he leaves the window. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
through the bars, exasperated. 
REVERSE SHOT - FULL - MELANIE 
as she tries to peek through the bars to see where he's vanished. A door to the left of the window opens, and the Clerk steps out. He walks a little distance as Melanie watches him, then stops, turns and looks at her surprised, as if he'd expected her to be right behind him. He stands stock still, looking at her, saying nothing. She understands then that he wants her to follow him, and she catches up, neither speaking. They go to the front door. He opens it, looks at her, then looks out across the town and the bay. He extends his arm and points. 
CLERK See where I'm pointing? 
MELANIE Yes? 
FULL SHOT - THE BAY - THEIR P.O.V. - (MATTE) 
CLERK (O.S.) See them two big trees across there? 
MELANIE (O.S.) Yes? 
CLERK (O.S.) And the white house? 
MELANIE (O.S.) That's where the Brenners live. 
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK 
MELANIE The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner? 
CLERK Nope, just Lydia and the two kids. 
MELANIE The two kids? 
CLERK Yep. Mitch and the little girl. 
MELANIE I see. How do I get down there? 
CLERK Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door. 
MELANIE The front door. (pause) Isn't there a back road I can take? 
CLERK Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door. 
MELANIE You see, I wanted to surprise them. 
CLERK Mmmm. 
MELANIE I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me. 
CLERK Mmmm. 
MELANIE It's a surprise, you see. 
CLERK Mmmmmm. (long pause) 'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do. 
MELANIE Where would I get a boat? 
CLERK Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat? 
MELANIE (looking at him) Of course. 
CLERK (looks back at her) D'you want me to order one for you? 
MELANIE (surprised) Thank you. 
CLERK What name? 
MELANIE Daniels. 
CLERK Okay. 
He nods briefly and goes inside. Melanie looks across the bay. 
FULL SHOT - THE BAY - MELANIE'S P.O.V. - (MATTE) 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
smiling. She gets a new idea. She reaches into her purse for the envelope. She looks at the envelope, then tears it up and stuffs the torn envelope into her handbag. She turns back toward the post office. 
INT. THE POST OFFICE - FULL SHOT 
as Melanie approaches the Clerk's window. He is still busy, still does not look up. 
MELANIE I wonder if you could tell me... 
CLERK Yep? 
MITCH You are, aren't you? 
MELANIE Certainly, but... 
MITCH Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother? 
LYDIA Seven o'clock, same as usual. 
MITCH I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying? 
MELANIE With... with Annie, of course. 
MITCH Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right? 
MELANIE Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way. 
MITCH You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything? 
MELANIE I'm sure. 
MITCH Seven o'clock then. 
MELANIE Maybe. 
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH 
grinning. 
MITCH We'll be waiting. How's your head now? 
MED. SHOT - THE GROUP 
Lydia looks at Mitch inquiringly. 
MELANIE (with an overwarm smile) It's nothing, Mrs. Brenner. A gull hit me, that's all. 
Lydia stares at her doubtfully. 
DISSOLVE 
EXT. ANNIE HAYWORTH'S HOUSE - FULL SHOT 
Melanie is standing on the front steps, a paper bag in her hands. She rings the doorbell. The ROOM TO LET sign is still in the window. The door suddenly opens. 
ANNIE (surprised) Oh, hi! (pause) Did you find her all right? 
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE 
MELANIE Yes, I did. 
There is a long awkward pause. Annie smiles expectantly at Melanie. Melanie seems hesitant. 
MELANIE I was wondering... 
ANNIE Yes? 
MELANIE That sign. (pause) Do you think I could have the room for a single night? 
ANNIE Well, I'd really hope to rent it for... 
MELANIE I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full. 
ANNIE (after a pause) Sure. You can have it. (smiles) Where's your bag? In the car? 
Melanie holds up the paper bag. Annie looks at it and then smiles. 
ANNIE It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it. 
MELANIE (smiling) I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here. 
ANNIE Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up? 
There is a moment where both women look at each other... When Melanie answers, it is abrupt and a trifle cold -- she is again telling Annie to mind her own business. 
MELANIE Yes. (pause) May I use your phone? I'd like to call home. 
There is another moment where Annie appraises Melanie's attitude, and then accepts it. She suddenly smiles warmly. 
ANNIE Why don't you come in then?  I was just about to mix a martini. 
She is about to lead Melanie into the house when they both hear a SOUND overhead. They turn to look skyward. 
LONG SHOT - A FLOCK OF LARGE BIRDS 
flying in beautiful precise formation against the sky. 
TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE 
ANNIE (shaking her head) Don't they ever stop migrating? 
But Melanie is watching the sky and the birds with a curiously serious expression. 
DISSOLVE 
LONG SHOT - THE APPROACH ROAD to the Brenner house. Melanie's car is driving along the shore. Behind her, the sky is stained with sunset. There are gulls on the bay, cawing into the silence. 
FULL SHOT - THE CAR 
as it pulls into the Brenner yard. 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE 
reaching up for the rear view mirror, tilting it to examine her lipstick, touching the edge of her mouth with one hand. She gets out of the car, CAMERA FOLLOWING her to the house. She climbs the porch steps, KNOCKS on the door. There is no answer. Puzzled, she begins walking back into the yard. In the distance, she sees Mitch, Lydia and Cathy coming from behind the chicken sheds. She raises her arm in greeting. 
MELANIE (calling) Hi! 
FULL SHOT - MITCH, CATHY, LYDIA 
in the distance. Mitch and Cathy raise their arms. 
CATHY (excitedly) Hi! (she breaks into a trot toward Melanie) 
CLOSE SHOT - CATHY as she approaches. She is an eleven-year- old child, clear-eyed, bright, uninhibited, wearing a shirt and blouse, her hair cropped close to her head. She hesitates for just a moment. 
CATHY Miss Daniels? 
MELANIE Yes? 
And Cathy flings herself into Melanie's arms, almost knocking her off her feet, hugging her fiercely. 
CATHY They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which. 
MELANIE Well, I suppose... 
FULL SHOT - ALL OF THEM 
MITCH (coming up) Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry? 
MELANIE Famished. 
MITCH Dinner's just about ready. (explaining) We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them. 
LYDIA (going toward house) There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now. 
MITCH Yes. 
LYDIA How long have you known her? 
MITCH I told you. We met yesterday. 
LYDIA In a bird shop. 
MITCH Yes. 
LYDIA She was selling birds. 
MITCH No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated. 
LYDIA But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way... 
MITCH Mother, where did you go to law school? 
LYDIA (laughing) Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that. (pause) She's very rich, isn't she? 
MITCH I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco. 
LYDIA You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch. 
MITCH I know, Mother. 
LYDIA She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she? 
MITCH Yes, Mother. 
LYDIA Perhaps I'm old-fashioned. (pause) I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked. 
MITCH I know, Mother. 
LYDIA It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to... 
MITCH Mother? 
LYDIA (looking up) Yes? 
MITCH I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself. 
LYDIA Well... (she sighs) So long as you know what you want, Mitch. 
MITCH I know exactly what I want, Mother. 
DISSOLVE 
FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER LAWN - EXTERIOR - NIGHT 
as Mitch and Melanie cross it to her car. A wind is blowing off the water, and high fast clouds are scudding across the face of the moon. 
MITCH You'll be able to find your way back, won't you? 
MELANIE Oh, yes. 
MELANIE Will I be seeing you again? 
MELANIE San Francisco's a long way from here. 
MITCH I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you. (he grins) Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim. 
MELANIE How does Mother know what I like to do? 
MITCH I guess she and I read the same gossip columns. 
MELANIE Oh. That. Rome. 
MITCH Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very... 
MELANIE In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain. 
MELANIE Without any clothes on? 
MELANIE With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said... 
MITCH You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh? 
MELANIE I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular... 
MITCH The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd... 
MELANIE Yes, but... 
MITCH ...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or... 
MELANIE Yes. 
MITCH ...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth? 
MELANIE Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too. 
MITCH Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth? 
MELANIE No. (pause) At least, I didn't until I came up here. 
MITCH So you didn't go to school together. 
MELANIE No. 
MITCH And you didn't come up here to see her. 
MELANIE No. 
MITCH You were lying. 
MELANIE Yes, I was lying. 
MITCH Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too? 
MELANIE I wrote the letter. 
MITCH What did it say? 
MELANIE It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said. 
MITCH But you tore it up. 
MELANIE Yes. 
MITCH Why? 
MELANIE Because it seemed stupid and foolish. 
MITCH Like jumping into a fountain in Rome! 
MELANIE I told you what happened in Rome! 
MITCH Do you expect me to believe...? 
MELANIE I don't give a damn what you believe! 
Angrily she gets into the car, is about to slam the door when Mitch catches it in his hands. 
ANNIE I think I'll have some of that, too. (she pours brandy, drinks, sighs) I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know. (she smiles weakly) And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia. 
MELANIE When was this? 
ANNIE Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now. 
MELANIE Different? 
ANNIE With Lydia. (pause) Did she seem a trifle distant? 
MELANIE (smiling) A trifle. 
ANNIE Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it. 
ANNIE When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her. 
MELANIE And what had you done? 
ANNIE Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother. (she shakes her head) Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all. 
MELANIE Then what was it? 
ANNIE Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends. 
MELANIE Then why did she object to you? 
ANNIE Because she was afraid. 
MELANIE Afraid you'd take Mitch? 
ANNIE Afraid I'd give Mitch. 
MELANIE I don't understand. 
ANNIE Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love. 
MELANIE Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman. 
ANNIE No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned. 
MELANIE Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter. 
ANNIE She already has a daughter. 
MELANIE What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this? 
ANNIE (apologetically) I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again. 
MELANIE I see. 
ANNIE So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished. 
MELANIE Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay? 
ANNIE You get straight to the point, don't you? 
MELANIE I'm sorry. Forgive me. 
ANNIE No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself. 
MELANIE I did. 
ANNIE Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.' (pause) And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time. (she sighs) That's the first reason. 
MELANIE And the second? 
ANNIE (simply) I wanted to be near Mitch. (pause) It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway. (she smiles) You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever. 
There is a moment of silence. Into the silence, the TELEPHONE shrills. Annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer it. 
CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE 
at the phone. 
ANNIE Hello?  Oh, hello. No, no, I wasn't asleep. What is it? (pause) Yes, just a little while ago. Sure, hold on. (she turns to Melanie) It's Mitch. For you. 
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE 
as they stare at each other across the room, Melanie hesitating. 
ANNIE He's waiting. 
Melanie rises and goes to the phone. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Annie to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her throughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie talks to Mitch in the background. 
Annie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally and irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl. 
MELANIE (at phone; coolly) Hello? Yes, this is Melanie. Fine, thank you. No, no trouble at all.  I simply followed the road. It's a very bright night. (pause) What?  Oh. Well, there's no need to apologize. I can understand... (pause; she listens) Well... (she listens again) That's very kind of you. No, I'm not angry. (she listens) I couldn't. I'm afraid I have to get back to San Francisco. (pause) No, I wouldn't want to disappoint Cathy, but... (pause) I see. (she is warming) I see. Well, if you really... (pause) All right. Yes, I'll be there. (pause) Good night, Mitch. 
She hangs up and looks at Annie in embarrassment. 
MELANIE He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon. (pause) I said I would. 
ANNIE I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie. 
MELANIE It seems so pointless. (she sighs) I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day. (picking up her paper bag) My luggage. 
She smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to Annie. 
ANNIE Pretty. Did you get that at Brinkmeyer's? 
Melanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. She is silent for a moment, pensive. Then: 
MELANIE Do you think I should go? 
ANNIE That's up to you. 
MELANIE It's really up to Lydia, isn't it? 
ANNIE Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go? 
MELANIE (firmly) Yes. 
ANNIE Then go. 
The room is silent. Melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles. 
MELANIE Thank you, Annie. 
Suddenly, into the silence, comes a THUMP at the door, startling them both. 
ANNIE (rising) Who can that be at this hour? (she walks to door) Who is it? (no answer) Is someone there? 
Melanie goes to stand beside Annie. Puzzled, Annie unlocks the door, and then opens it. She looks out into the night. There is nothing but the SOUND of the wind. 
ANNIE (to the emptiness outside) Is anyone there? 
MELANIE (pointing to the ground) Look. 
CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD SEAGULL 
CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

MELANIE Yes. 
ANNIE (coming over) That's the darnest thing thing I've ever seen in my life. 
TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH 
LYDIA Are they gone? 
MITCH They're gone, Mother. 
FULL SHOT - THE LAWN 
as the children begin drifting back toward the table and the cake. There is the curious feeling of lighting having struck very close by without having injured anyone. All that adrenaline has boiled up, and now it has no place to go. 
LYDIA Well... well, is everyone all right? 
MITCH (with a small boy) I think he got a little scratch, Mother. 
GIRL #3 Did you see them? They were hawks! 
GIRL #4 They were bigger than hawks! 
ANNIE Children, they were only seagulls. 
And then the meaning of what she has just said strikes her, and she remembers the bird hitting her door the night before. 
TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE 
as Annie turns to look at her and they exchange a silent meaningful glance. 
BACK TO SCENE 
CATHY They must have been after the food, Mother. 
They all turn toward the table.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH 
as Annie and the children begin the game behind them. 
MITCH You look a little shaken. 
MELANIE I... I am. (pause) Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now... 
MITCH Last night? What do you mean? 
MELANIE A gull smashed into Annie's front door. (pause) Mitch... what's happening? 
MITCH (concerned) I don't know, Melanie. (pause) Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?

CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER WINDOW PANE 
as a bird crashes through it.

CLOSE SHOT - THE FIRE 
blazing. 
MED. SHOT - A BIRD 
swooping out of the fireplace, its wings aflame. 
FULL SHOT - THE ROOM 
less birds in the air now, the single flaming bird flying toward the drapes.

A shambles. Windows broken, furniture knocked over, pictures askew, the floor covered with birds and broken glass. In a corner of the room, Lydia crouches with her hands covering her face, sobbing. The burnt curtain is still smoldering. Mitch is covered with soot. Melanie puts down the broom wearily. The attack is over. 
DISSOLVE 
INT. BRENNER LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - A HAND 
reaching down to pick up a dead bird. 
MED. SHOT - AL MALONE, THE DEPUTY 
a plain man with a limited intelligence, used to giving out speeding tickets or warning drunks. He holds the bird on the palm of his hand, looks at it steadily, nodding all the while. 
MALONE That's a chimney swift, all right. 
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH 
MITCH We know what it is, Al. 
FULL SHOT - THE ROOM 
Lydia is huddled in one of the easy chairs, still in shock. 
MALONE Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know. 
MITCH Not by the thousands. 
MALONE No, I gotta admit this is peculiar. (pause) Did you have a light burning or something. 
as Cathy, carrying her schoolbooks, runs to the pickup truck and climbs in. The truck moves out of the yard and down the road. It turns the bend, and moves out of sight. 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE 
turning from the window. She goes to the bedroom door, CAMERA FOLLOWING. She opens the door. 
MELANIE Mitch? 
There is no answer. 
MELANIE Mitch?

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS 
She smiles and pokes her finger into the cage. The birds TWEET at her. 
MELANIE (imitating them) Chee-chee-chee-chee-chee. 
FULL SHOT - MELANIE 
leaving the cage. She walks to the sideboard upon which is an electric coffee percolator which is plugged into the wall. She feels it with her hand. It is hot. She pours a cup, then peers out of the side window. 
LONG SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V. 
Mitch on the shore, working with a rake in his hands. A thin column of smoke is climbing the sky.

FULL SHOT - MELANIE 
coming out of the house and into the garden, carrying the cup of coffee. It is a beautiful day. She sips at her coffee and then breathes deeply of the air. 
CLOSE SHOT - HER FACE 
fresh, rested. There is a contentment in her which we have not seen before. She looks off toward the shore. 
LONG SHOT - MITCH 
on the shore, working with the rake. The thin column of smoke is climbing the sky. 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE 
She turns her attention away from Mitch, and walks to the end of the garden toward the shore. A wind is blowing off the water, moving white puffs of cloud swiftly across the sky, whipping the full short shirt of muumuu about her legs as she walks. She stands there silhouetted against the sky for a moment. 
SLOW PAN 
as Melanie scans the horizon. There isn't a bird anywhere in sight. The day is still and clear, but somehow ominous in its silence. Her gaze comes to rest on Mitch and the thin column of smoke again. In the distance, Mitch sees her and raises his arm in greeting. She waves back at him. He puts the rake down and begins walking toward the house. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
There is anticipation on her face now. She watches Mitch coming toward her, her eyes glowing. 
FULL SHOT - MITCH 
closer to the house now. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
waiting, anticipating. 
MED. SHOT - MITCH 
He stops, looks at her, and then turns toward the house. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
as first surprised, and then puzzled. The back screen DOOR CLATTERS shut off screen. A small hurt look crosses her face. 
FULL SHOT - MELANIE 
as she turns away from the house and begins walking in the garden, sipping idly at her coffee. A screen DOOR CLATTERS again. She turns. 
Mitch is coming out of the house, from the front door, wearing a different shirt, buttoning it as he walks to her. 
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH 
MITCH I wanted to change my shirt. 
Melanie is uncomprehending. 
MITCH It smelled of the fire. 
MELANIE (nodding) It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now. (pause; then sagely) I think I've got it all figured out, by the way. 
MITCH Really? Tell me about it. 
MELANIE (secretively) It's an uprising. 
MITCH Of birds? 
MELANIE Certainly, of birds. 
Mitch grins. 
MELANIE It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen... 
MITCH Growing a beard... 
MELANIE (delighted) Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over... 
MITCH So they united. 
MELANIE Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks... 
MITCH Well, they'll go along with anything. 
MELANIE Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves. 
MITCH Hear! 
MELANIE Why should we submit ourselves to their domination? 
MITCH Hear, hear! 
MELANIE And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite! 
MITCH Take wing! 
MELANIE You have nothing to lose but your feathers. 
They both burst out laughing, then fall into silence, then laugh again and finally are silent. The garden is deathly still. 
MITCH (attempting to be serious) What it was, probably... 
MELANIE Mmm? 
MITCH They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it. 
a small knowledgeable nod of her head. The chicken's reaction strengthens her determination to talk to Fawcett.  She turns. 
FULL SHOT - LYDIA 
approaching the front door again. She knocks. No answer. 
LYDIA Dan? 
She backs away from the house again. The barnyard is silent. In the distance, we can HEAR the SOUND of the tractor. 
LYDIA Dan? Are you home? 
No answer.

a door at the end of it is partially ajar, spilling artificial light into the corridor.

FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

LYDIA Dan? Are you in there?

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA 
coming into the room. Her eyes begin to take in the room. 
SLOW PAN OF THE ROOM - LYDIA'S P.O.V. 
starting to the right of the doorway as she enters and continuing a little below eye level, the CAMERA PICKS OUT: A standing floor lamp, the shade dangling, but the light still burning; a picture hanging askew on the wall, its glass shattered; the window to the left of the picture, every pane of glass shattered; a dresser with two stuffed birds on its top; both birds have been badly damaged, the stuffing ripped out of them, the head of one hanging at a crooked near decapitated angle; the window to the left of the dresser, all the panes shattered. The level of the CAMERA DESCENDS, and begins a SLOW PAN of the floor. It PICKS OUT broken glass, continues its PAN to SHOW scattered feathers, continues its PAN to SHOW a broom, feathers caught in the straw, a single bedroom slipper, continues to SHOW a pair of legs in pajamas, one foot bare, the other slippered, and then immediately 
CUTS TO:

FULL SHOT - LYDIA 
turning and running for the door. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her in an unbroken headlong flight, the scream continuing as if she is incapable of stopping it, as she stumbles, runs, trips her way down the corridor and bursts out of the house, still screaming, into the pickup truck. The engine starts, she backs the truck out at breakneck speed and hits the highway, 
CAMERA FOLLOWING.  CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

FULL SHOT - THE ROAD - LYDIA'S POV

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH 
MITCH That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while. (pause) Will you be all right here? 
MELANIE Yes. I was just taking her in some tea. 
He goes to her, puts his arms around her from behind, kisses her hair. But she turns in his arms suddenly and clings to him fiercely, and then buries her head in his shoulder. 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE 
smiling as she gets out of the car and heads for the school.

EXT. SCHOOL - MED. PANNING SHOT 
Melanie emerges and strolls up street toward Annie's house. Inside the children are still singing.

head and shoulders of Melanie as she sits smoking. There is no sound except for the faint voices of the children singing inside the schoolhouse. Melanie is puffing away at her cigarette and occasionally glances in the direction of the school. We hold on this shot of Melanie for a very long time so that we are able to express her ignorance of what is going on behind her with the crows. After a wait of about what seems to be a half a minute or more, Melanie's attention is drawn to something above her.

INT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT 
It is lunchtime and there is a busy bustle to the place as DEKE CARTER officiates behind the bar and HELEN CARTER, his wife, rushes back and forth between diners at the tables. A DRUNK sits at the bar, old, grizzled, the weary wisdom of booze in him. In one of the booths sits SEBASTIAN SHOLES in his shirt sleeves, eating a hurried lunch quickly and efficiently. A WOMAN and TWO CHILDREN are seated at another table, about to order. A party of noisy SALESMAN is laughing and clowning around throughout following at a table in the rear. The phone from behind the bar has been placed on the counter, and Melanie is speaking into it while Deke listens. Over her head, the television set is blasting with its perennial Western, the gun shots punctuating her conversation. 
MELANIE Daddy, there were hundreds of them. No, I'm not hysterical, I'm trying to tell you this as calmly as I know how. All right, Daddy. Yes Daddy. (she takes a deep breath) Just now.  Not... fifteen minutes ago. 
The door to the Tides opens and MRS. BUNDY, sixtyish, wearing walking shoes and a tweed suit, a very masculine-looking woman with short clipped white hair, comes in, passes through foreground, goes to bar, her attention slowly caught by what Melanie is saying. 
MELANIE At the school. No, I don't. Just a minute. (to Deke) What's the name of the school? 
DEKE Just the Bodega Bay School. (to Mrs. Bundy) Help you, Mrs. Bundy? 
MRS. BUNDY I need some change, Mr. Carter. 
As Deke opens cash register... 
MELANIE The Bodega Bay School. (to Deke) Could you turn that down, please? 
Deke gives Mrs. Bundy her change, turns off television. 
MELANIE I don't know how many children. Thirty or forty. Yes. 
Mrs. Bundy goes to cigarette machine, pauses to listen to Melanie. 
MELANIE No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds? 
MRS. BUNDY (turning from machine) There is very definitely a difference, Miss. 
MELANIE They're different, Daddy. (to Mrs. Bundy) Thank you. (into phone) I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them. (exasperated) Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right. (pause) No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope... (pause) I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by. 
She hangs up. Mrs. Bundy is at her elbow. 
A TRAVELING SALESMAN ENTERS, goes to bar, listens. 
MRS. BUNDY Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity? 
MELANIE No one called it a war! 
SALESMAN Scotch, light on the water. 
MRS. BUNDY You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much. 
HELEN Are you finished here, Sebastian? 
SHOLES Let me have some apple pie, Helen. (to Mrs. Bundy) Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls... 
HELEN (yelling to kitchen) One apple pie! You want more coffee? 
SHOLES No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said. 
SALESMAN Your captain should have shot at them. 
SHOLES What? 
SALESMAN Gulls are scavengers, anyway. Most birds are. If you ask me, we should wipe them all out. World would be better off without them. 
MRS. BUNDY (outraged) Birds? 
SALESMAN Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them? 
MRS. BUNDY We need them. 
SALESMAN Not if they're starting a war. 
MRS. BUNDY They are incapable of organized warfare! 
MELANIE Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest? 
MRS. BUNDY I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between... 
MELANIE Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and... 
MRS. BUNDY Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know. 
MELANIE I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town. 
SALESMAN Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth. 
MRS. BUNDY That would hardly be possible. 
DEKE Why not, Mrs. Bundy? 
MRS. BUNDY Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world... 
SALESMAN (muttering) Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals. 
MRS. BUNDY ...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds! 
DRUNK It's the end of the world! 
DEKE Well, we seem to have more than our share of them right now, Mrs. Bundy. Maybe this young lady's right.  Maybe they've all gone crazy. 
HELEN Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table? 
SHOLES No. Here's fine. (he begins eating) 
HELEN Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke? 
DEKE Coming. 
HELEN (angrily) Are we running a business here -- or a bird sanctuary? 
SHOLES (beginning to change his mind) Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish. 
MRS. BUNDY Of course. 
SHOLES Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack. 
MRS. BUNDY Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of... 
DRUNK Cockroaches!  Urghh! 
CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN 
getting more and more anxious. 
WOMAN Hurry, children. Finish your lunch. 
BOY Are the birds gonna eat us, Mommy? 
SHOLES Maybe we're all getting a little carried away by this. Admittedly, a few birds acted strangely. That's no reason to believe... 
MELANIE This isn't a few birds! I keep telling you that! These are gulls and swifts and crows and... 
MRS. BUNDY And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles? 
MELANIE Maybe! Is it impossible? 
MRS. BUNDY Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable. (laughing) Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them? 
SHOLES We couldn't. You're right, Mrs. Bundy. 
WOMAN (calling from table) Excuse me, may I have a check, please? 
HELEN (concerned) Is everything all right, ma'am? 
WOMAN Yes, I... I'm anxious to get on the road. 
SAM (coming from kitchen) What's the matter? Something wrong out here? 
DEKE Nothing's wrong. 
SAM All this shouting. 
MRS. BUNDY We're fighting a war, Sam. 
SAM A war? Against who? Did the Russians...? 
SHOLES Against birds. 
WOMAN (suddenly) I'm glad you all think this is so amusing. You've frightened my children half out of their wits. 
BOY I'm not scared, Mommy. 
WOMAN Keep quiet. If that young lady saw an attack on the school, why won't you believe her? 
SAM What attack? Who attacked the school? 
WOMAN Birds did. Crows! And you're all sitting around here debating! What do you want them to do next? Crash through that window? 
LITTLE GIRL (frightened by her mother) Mommy! 
WOMAN Quiet! Why don't you all get home? Lock your doors and windows! (her hysteria rising) Put on your coats, children! (to Deke) What's the fastest road to San Francisco? 
DEKE The freeway, ma'am. 
MRS. BUNDY Birds are not bad! 
SHOLES How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke? 
MITCH Can we go on living here otherwise? 
Pause. They are silent. 
SAM (slowly) It's worth a try, Sebastian. 
There is more silence as they all consider. And then suddenly: 
MELANIE Look! 
They turn toward the window. 
TIDES CAR PARK - FULL SHOT 
Viewed from the side window inside the Tides we see three or four gulls diving down toward the highway over the roof of the Tides Office. Two more swoop into the foreground of the window and out to the left. 
DEKE (alarmed) Gulls! 
MITCH They're back! 
SHOLES They're only the usual... What are you... 
TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT 
The first gull reaches the gas station but misses the attendant who is in the act of filling the car. The owner is seen disappearing into the men's room. 
INT. TIDES 
A quick flash of the group of faces at the window of the Tides Restaurant. 
TIDES TOWN - MED. SHOT 
A nearer view of the gas station. A second gull hits the man on the back -- he falls -- hits his head on the pump and then collapses over the gasoline hose pipe, pulling it out and causing it to spill. The third and fourth gulls sweep by.  The gas begins to flow away. 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH 
inside the Tides. Mitch dashes toward the door -- Melanie after him. Through the glass windows into the street we see people dashing off to the right, in the direction of the gas station. At the door, Mitch turns. 
MITCH (to Melanie) Stay back in here. 
Deke Carter comes running from behind the bar to join Mitch. They both EXIT. Melanie dashes back to her original place at the window. The CAMERA RETREATING with her, we come to the window and over Melanie's shoulder we see the men arrive to rescue the attacked gas station attendant. 
Three or four gulls are still attacking and they flutter away as the men appear to beat them off. Suddenly Melanie in the foreground turns in full profile to her right and looks down. 
TIDES CAR PARK - MED. SHOT 
on the sloping pavement before her a stream of gasoline is flowing to the right into the car park. 
CLOSE SHOT - GASOLINE 
flowing down to the car park. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
through the window. She suddenly looks toward the gas station. 
MED. SHOT - THE CAMERA PANS 
along the flowing gas back to the station. 
CLOSEUP - MELANIE 
She turns back to the car park. 
FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT 
We see the flow of gasoline trickling toward the car parked below her. At this particular moment, a car has pulled up, has come to a stop and a man emerges. He is in the act of lighting his dead cigar, but his attention is drawn to the happenings around the gas station. With this half-drawn attention, he strikes the match and holds it to the cigar. 
CLOSEUP - MELANIE 
She quickly slides the window open and yells down to the man. 
FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT 
The man looks about him, holding the match I his fingers. As he catches sight of Melanie, the match burns his finger and he drops it. 
CLOSEUP - MELANIE 
Her horror-stricken face. 
FULL SHOT - THE PARKING AREA 
Three fast explosions in a row as the man's car, Mitch's car, and the one next to it go up in flames. 
CLOSE SHOT - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE 
TURNING TO SEE 
FULL SHOT - THE GAS STATION 
The line of flame running swiftly from the burning cars, following the gasoline on the ground, directly to the pump, which blows up as the men are jumping away with the injured attendant. 
EXT. TIDES TOWN AND CAR PARK - MATTE SHOT 
A very high shot shows the beginning of the people of the town rushing around the car park and the streets across the highway, endeavoring to put out the two fires. We see automobiles coming to a stop on Highway One, and the oil smoke beginning to rise from the burning gas station and the parked cars. Some men have managed to start a fire hose and have trained it on the burning cars. Suddenly but slowly the foreground in the sky just below the CAMERA begins to fill with wheeling gulls. The whole picture below becomes obliterated by the foreground birds who now begin to swoop down on the town. 
EXT. TIDES TOWN 
A raking shot outside the Tides Restaurant showing the phone booth and motel off in the background. People are rushing out from the restaurant and look up in the sky. Gulls begin to descend into the scene, driving the people back into the restaurant. Melanie is seen in the distance calling for Mitch: 
MELANIE Mitch...! Mitch! 
We see her look up to the sky. 
LONG SHOT - THE SKY 
The sky is full of seagulls. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
Looking about her frantically. She turns her face up again to see the descending gulls. She is driven to take refuge in the phone booth. 
CLOSEUP - INSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH - MELANIE 
slams the door shut. Gulls are now beating at the glass all around her. 
EXT. TIDES TOWN 
From Melanie's viewpoint inside the booth we see the people who have been rushing to put out the fire now faced with clouds of birds coming on them. 
CLOSEUP - MELANIE 
looking out in terrified alarm but still searching with her eyes for Mitch. 
MED. SHOT - PEOPLE RUSHING FROM THE TIDES 
CLOSEUP - MELANIE 
in the phone booth. She turns and looks swiftly in the direction of the car park. 
LYDIA When do you think they'll come? 
MITCH I don't know. 
LYDIA If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house. 
MITCH That's a chance we have to take. 
LYDIA Maybe we ought to leave. 
MITCH Not now.  Not while they're massing out there. 
LYDIA When? 
MITCH I don't know when.  We'll see what... 
LYDIA Where will we go? 
MITCH I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here. (Pause) Let's bring that wood in. 
LYDIA What happens when we run out of wood? 
Music begins to play.  The music is sweet, with violins and long piano arpeggios, almost too much to bear against the tension being played in front of it. 
MITCH I don't know. We'll break up the furni... 
LYDIA (shouting) You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie? 
CATHY (shrieking it, her face white) Mother! 
LYDIA (at Mitch) If your father were here... 
MITCH (sharply) Mother! I'm trying my best! (shaking his head) I'm... trying... my... 
LYDIA (trembling, nodding) I'm sorry, Mitch. 
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH 
the strain showing on his face. He nods briefly. 
MITCH Let's get the wood. Why don't you make us all some coffee, Mother? 
FULL SHOT - HOUSE 
as Melanie and Mitch come out and head for the pile of wood. There is a NOISE in the sky. Startled, glancing upward, they begin to run back toward the house and then stop and slowly scan the sky. 
FULL SHOT - ENORMOUS FLOCK OF BIRDS 
flying in tight formation. 
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH 
MELANIE Where are they heading? 
MITCH Inland. 
MELANIE Santa Rosa? 
MITCH Maybe. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
watching the birds. A look of utter sadness crosses her face. It is clear that she is thinking the birds will reach Santa Rosa, and eventually San Francisco as well. 
MITCH (O.S.) (gently) Come on. Let's get this wood in. 
Melanie nods. But the look of sadness stays on her face, and her eyes remain on the sky. 
DISSOLVE 
FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM 
Lydia is pouring coffee into cups. In the dining room, we can HEAR the CHATTER of the lovebirds. As Lydia pours the sound distracts her. Cathy is sorting candles at the couch. There is evidence of preparation everywhere: flashlights, kerosene lamps, a butane burner. Mitch is at the fireplace putting more wood on the fire. Melanie comes into the room and dumps another load. 
MELANIE That's the last of it. 
LYDIA Did you close the door? 
MELANIE And locked it. 
CATHY Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here? 
LYDIA (snapping it) No! 
CATHY Mom, they're in a cage! 
LYDIA They're birds! 
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH 
studying his mother, realizing how close she is to breaking. 
MITCH (softly) Let them stay in the other room. 
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA 
her hand trembling as she pours the coffee. 
FULL SHOT - THE ROOM 
as they all sit and accept their coffee. The room is silent except for the CRACKLE of the fire. Mitch rises to put more wood on the fire. In the dining room, the lovebirds still are CHATTERING wildly. Their chirping is the only sound in the house. 
CATHY Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds. 
MITCH (putting wood on fire) I don't know, honey. 
CATHY Why are they trying to kill people? 
MITCH I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people. 
The room is silent again except for the TWEETING of the lovebirds offscreen. And then, suddenly, the lovebirds fall silent. 
CLOSE SHOT - CATHY 
turning to look toward the other room, her face going white, her eyes widening. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
waiting. 
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA 
waiting. 
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH 
waiting. 
FULL SHOT - THE ROOM 
dead silent now. Each of them is sitting on the edges of their chairs, waiting. There is the SUDDEN SOUND of splintering glass. 
LYDIA Mitch... 
MELANIE (whispering) Mitch? 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE 
as she turns toward him. 
MELANIE (still whispering) Mitch? 
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH 
asleep. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
seeing this, making her decision. The SOUND is still coming from somewhere in the house. She decides to let Mitch sleep, picks up a very long flashlight. 
FULL SHOT - MELANIE 
as she goes through the house, checking. She stops in the entry hall, plays the flashlight over the furniture piled against the door. Everything seems all right. She goes into the kitchen, again, checks the door, and then plays the beam on the boarded windows. Satisfied, she goes down the corridor outside the bedroom. She opens the first bedroom door, enters, goes to the windows, plays the beam on them.  Everything's all right. She comes into the corridor again, opens the second bedroom door, again checks windows, and leaves. 
FULL SHOT - MELANIE 
climbing the steps to the attic. She stops outside the first door upstairs, opens it, goes into the room, plays the light on the windows. Nothing. She comes out into the corridor, goes to the second bedroom, opens the door, enters, walks to the windows. They are boarded securely. She is starting back toward the door when she stops. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
looking. 
CLOSE SHOT - THE FLOOR 
a pile of chipped and broken plaster. 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE 
turning the flashlight up toward the ceiling. 
CLOSE SHOT - THE CEILING 
A huge hole in it, showing moonlit sky outside. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
turning her eyes from the ceiling, determination on her face, and suddenly, her eyes open wide. 
CLOSE SHOT - AN OWL 
sitting in the darkness, staring at her. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
reacting. 
QUICK MED. SHOT - THE OWL 
wings spread in the beam of light. 
FULL SHOT - MELANIE 
backing to the door. The owl hits her, sends her staggering back, causing the door to slam shut. She looks up at the 
FULL SHOT - THE CEILING 
a swarm of mixed birds coming through the hole and down toward her. 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE 
in the room swinging the lighted flashlight as the birds attack her. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
in the room, as the owl hits her full in the face. 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE 
swinging the flashlight as the birds attack her. 
MITCH (O.S.) Melanie! 
FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS 
grotesque and silent as she struggles with them. The room is a crossing cacophony of mixed light beams and fluttering wings. 
MITCH (O.S.) Melanie, open the door! 
He hurls himself against it. Inside the room, where Melanie struggles, we HEAR his hammering on it. Melanie is overwhelmed by the birds. 
She falls to the floor, the flashlight beside her. In the spreading rays of the light, we see the frantic fluttering of wings as the birds cover her. There is a stronger assault on the door by Mitch outside. 
LYDIA (O.S.) (screaming) Mitch, get her out of there! 
MED. SHOT - THE ROOM 
Melanie, collapsed at the base of the door, is no longer in view. Neither are the birds, whose fluttering shadows we see on the door as Mitch again hits it from outside. 
MITCH (O.S.) Melanie! 
The door begins to open. 
FULL SHOT - MITCH 
as the door bursts inward and he stumbles into the room.  He begins swinging at the birds immediately, reaching down for Melanie, fighting off the attack at the same time. He begins dragging her out of the room. Her clothes have almost been shredded from her body, and her face is torn and bleeding. We catch only quick glimpses of her near-nudity, as Mitch pulls her into the corridor and then, holding the door shut behind him with one hand, delivers swinging furious blows at the few birds that have escaped into the corridor. 
MITCH Mother, get a rope! 
LYDIA Oh, my God, look at her! 
MITCH (shouting) Get a rope! 
She rushes off. He struggles grotesquely with the birds. There is a wild fury in him, and a methodical dedication. He will not allow them to defeat him. A large bird strikes his hand, knocking the club from it. 
MED. SHOT - MITCH 
as the bird strikes at his face. He reaches out with his hands, grasping the bird, letting go of the door knob. Another bird flutters into the corridor. 
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH 
in anger and desperation as he throttles the bird with his hands. He reaches behind him to grab the doorknob again, and is immediately attacked by the other bird. 
MITCH (yelling) Mother! Hurry! 
TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH 
as she runs up the steps and into the corridor, carrying a heavy piece of rope. Mitch grabs the bird and hurls it angrily to the floor. Lydia is staring down at Melanie in terror and compassion. He takes the rope from her, loops it over the doorknob, pulls it taut across the hallway, and ties it to the bannister, sealing the door. He turns immediately to Melanie, picks her up and carries her to the steps, Lydia following. As they go downstairs: 
MITCH Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages! 
CATHY (at the foot of the stars, on the verge of tears) Is she all right? 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
cradled against Mitch's shoulder, her face bleeding profusely. 
MELANIE I'm... I'm.... 
Cathy closes the door gently, and almost soundlessly. Mitch does the same with his door. 
MELANIE (weakly) Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement... 
MITCH We'll take it slow until we get to the main road. (pause) Are you ready? 
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HAND 
turning the key. The motor springs to life. 
FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR 
anticipation on all the faces. 
MITCH All right. (he takes a deep breath) Here we go. 
FULL SHOT - THE CAR 
from the outside, as it creeps out of the yard. The bay is still, the road is still, the car makes barely a sound as it passes the gate and starts down the road. 
MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD 
as they begin driving slowly. The wires are down. A small fire is burning in the brush, where the wires made contact. The car continues to move. It turns the first bend in the road. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW 
She gasps quickly. 
MED. SHOT - A GROUP OF HERONS - AT WATER'S EDGE 
standing, waiting silently. 
FULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR 
as the tension begins to starts. 
MITCH Shhh.  Shhhh. 
MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD 
as they approach the derelict barge. It is covered with waiting seagulls. 
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA 
seeing them. Her lip begins to tremble. 
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH 
turning toward the side of the road ahead. 
FULL SHOT - AN OVERTURNED SCHOOL BUS - MITCH'S P.O.V. 
covered with waiting birds. 
CATHY (whispering) Mitch, let's turn back. 
MITCH Shhh. Shhhhh. 
MED. SHOT - A ROADSIDE HOUSE 
as the car passes. A barricade has been set up on the front porch, and a man is leaning over it, dead, a shotgun in his hands. The porch is covered with waiting birds. At the boarded window, we see a woman and child peering from a gap. 
CLOSE SHOT - CATHY 
reacting. 
FULL SHOT - THE CAR - BIRD'S P.O.V. 
as it threads its way slowly and cautiously along the winding road to town. The birds are sitting on some of the still- standing wires, watching, waiting. 
FULL SHOT - THE TOWN APPROACH - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD as the car turns a bend in the road. There are thousands of birds ahead, on every gutted and smoldering rooftop, on every pole, on every fence. 
LYDIA Mitch! 
MED. SHOT - MITCH 
as he stops the car and looks ahead. 
FULL SHOT - THE CAR 
in the middle of the road, stopped. Ahead are the birds. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
frightened, try not to reveal her fear. 
MELANIE Can we turn back? 
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH 
MITCH I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right. 
FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR 
There is a long silence. It is Melanie who has the strongest reason for fearing the birds. It is Melanie, her fear growing, who makes the decision. 
MELANIE Then go ahead, Mitch. 
FULL SHOT - EXT. THE CAR 
as it begins moving forward again at an excruciatingly slow rate of speed, into the town and the waiting birds. 
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA 
as she turns to look out the window on her side. 
CLOSE SHOT - A LINE OF BIRDS 
as the car moves past them slowly. 
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA 
closing her eyes. 
FULL SHOT - BRINKMEYER'S GENERAL STORE 
through the windshield. The roof and sills are covered with birds. The window is smashed in, canned goods are strewn all over the sidewalk, bolts of cloth run in a riot from the open door and across the road, dead people are lying in the gutter. But in the hotel, we see some faces behind broken windows. 
TWO SHOT - CATHY, MITCH 
The tension on their faces, 
MED. SHOT - THE STORES OPPOSITE THE TIDES 
as the car approaches them. The windows are all broken, and merchandise is lying on the sidewalk. Birds are everywhere, waiting. 
CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD MAN 
lying on the sidewalk, clutching a television set in his arms. 
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH 
strained, looking at the road ahead.

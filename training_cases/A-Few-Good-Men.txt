SHERBY (calling back) I don't think so, Danny. 
KAFFEE (back to SPRADLING) Dave, Sherby doesn't think the Navy hangs people from yardarms anymore. (back to the field) Let's go, let's get two! 
He goes back to hitting fungoes. 
SPRADLING I'm gonna charge him with possession and being under the influence while on duty. Plead guilty and I'll recommend 30 days in the brig with loss of rank and pay. 
KAFFEE It was oregano, Dave, it was ten dollars worth of oregano. 
SPRADLING Yeah, well your client thought it was marijuana. 
KAFFEE My client's a moron, that's not against the law. 
Swapp! The THIRD BASEMAN takes one in the face. 
KAFFEE (continuing) Ow. That had to hurt. (calling out) Way to keep your head in the play, Lester. Walk it off! 
SPRADLING I've got people to answer to just like you, I'm gonna charge him. 
KAFFEE With what, possession of a condiment? 
SPRADLING Kaffee -- 
KAFFEE Dave, I've tried to help you out of this, but if you ask for tall time, I'm gonna file a motion to dismiss. 
SPRADLING You won't got it. 
KAFFEE I will get it. And if the MTD is denied, I'll file a motion in liminee seeking to obtain evidentiary ruling in advance, and after that I'm gonna file against pre-trial confinement, and you're gonna spend an entire summer going blind on paperwork because a Signalman Second Class bought and smoked a dime bag of oregano. 
SPRADLING B Misdemeanor, 20 days in the brig. 
KAFFEE C Misdemeanor, 15 days restricted duty. 
SPRADLING I don't know why I'm agreeing to this. 
KAFFEE 'Cause you have wisdom beyond your years. Dave, can you play third base? 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
About 16 NAVY AND MARINE LAWYERS (several of whom are women) are taking their seats around a large conference table. 
A PARALEGAL is handing out folders and some photocopied papers to the LAWYERS. 
We might notice that one of the lawyers is Lieutenant Junior Grade SAM WEINBERG. Sam's serious and studious looking. If he weren't in uniform, you wouldn't guess that he was a naval officer. 
CAPTAIN WHITAKER walks in. 
WHITAKER 'Morning. 
LAWYERS (school class) 'Morning Captain Whitaker. 
WHITAKER Sam, how's the baby? 
SAM I think she's ready to say her first word any day now. 
WHITAKER How can you tell? 
SAM She just looks like she has something to say. 
KAFFEE walks in. 
KAFFEE Excuse me, sorry I'm late. 
WHITAKER I'm sure you don't have a good excuse, so I won't force you to come up with a bad one. 
KAFFEE Thank you, Isaac, that's nice of you. 
WHITAKER Sit-down, this first one's for you. 
He hands KAFFEE some files. 
WHITAKER (continuing) You're moving up in the world, Danny, you've been requested by Division. 
"Oooh"'s and "Ahhh"'S from the other LAWYERS. (Subtle Note: Kaffee doesn't want to move up in the world.) 
KAFFEE Requested to do what? 
WHITAKER hands him a file. 
WHITAKER Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A marine corporal named Dawson illegally fires a round from his weapon over the fenceline and into Cuban territory. 
KAFFEE What's a fenceline? 
WHITAKER Sam? 
SAM A big wall separating the good guys from the bad guys. 
KAFFEE Teachers pet. 
WHITAKER PFC William Santiago threatens to rat on Dawson to the Naval investigative Service. Dawson and another member of his squad, PFC Louden Downey, they go into Santiago's room, tie him up, and stuff a rag down his throat. An hour later, Santiago's dead. Attending physician says the rag was treated with some kind of toxin. 
KAFFEE They poisoned the rag? 
WHITAKER Not according to them. 
KAFFEE What do they say? 
WHITAKER Not much. They're being flown up here tomorrow and on Thursday at 0600 you'll catch a transport down to Cuba for the day to find out what you can. Meantime, go across the yard and see Lt. Commander Joanne Galloway. She's the one who had 'em brought up here. She'll fill you in on whatever she has. Any questions? 
KAFFEE The flight to Cuba, was that 0600 in the morning, sir? 
WHITAKER It seems important to Division that this one be handled by the book, so I'm assigning co-counsel. Any volunteers? 
SAM No. 
JO This last letter to the Naval investigative Service -- 
She hands it to KAFFEE who hands it to Sam -- 
JO (continuing) -- where he offers information about Corporal Dawson's fenceline shooting in exchange for a transfer, was just a last ditch effort. 
KAFFEE Right. Is that all? 
JO (beat) Lieutenant, this letter makes it look like your client had a motive to kill Santiago. 
KAFFEE Gotcha. (beat) And Santiago is... who? 
JO (beat) The victim. 
KAFFEE (to SAM) Write that down. (to JO) Am I correct in assuming that these letters don't paint a flattering picture of marine corps life in Guantanamo Bay? 
JO Yes, among other -- 
KAFFEE And am I further right in assuming that a protracted investigation of this incident might cause some embarrassment for the security counsel guy. 
JO Colonel Jessep, yes, but -- 
KAFFEE Twelve years. 
JO I'm sorry? 
KAFFEE Twelve years. I can get it knocked down to Involuntary Manslaughter. Twelve years. 
JO You haven't talked to a witness, you haven't looked at a piece of paper. 
KAFFEE Pretty impressive, huh? 
JO You're gonna have to go deeper than just -- 
KAFFEE Commander, do you have some sort of jurisdiction here that I should know about? 
JO My job is to make sure you do your job. I'm special counsel for Internal Affairs, so my jurisdiction's pretty much in your face. Read the letters. You're not under any obligation, but I'd appreciate a report when you get back from Cuba. 
KAFFEE Sure. 
KAFFEE gets up without waiting for JO to say -- 
JO You're dismissed. 
KAFFEE Sorry, I always forget that. 
KAFFEE's gone. SAM's standing in the doorway. 
SAM He's a little preoccupied. (beat) The team's playing Bethesda Medical next week. 
JO Tell your friend not to get cute down there.  The marines in Guantanimo are fanatical. 
SAM About what? 
And in VOICE OVER we HEAR -- 
SANTIAGO (V.O.) Dear Sir, 
JO About being marines. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CUBAN FIELD - DAY 
SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY 
And while we HEAR the letter read in V.O., what we're seeing is this: SANTIAGO's life in Guantanimo Bay over the last 8 months. He had a rough time of it. 
THE SHOTS SHOULD INCLUDE: 
-- SANTIAGO running along at the rear of a group of MARINES. It's been over seven miles and he's matted with sweat. A SERGEANT runs up along side, grabs his back, and pushes him to keep up with the group. SANTIAGO falls, struggles to get back up and keep running, and 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MARINE BARRACKS - DAY 
-- SANTIAGO doing push-ups alone in the rain. He's being supervised by a SERGEANT who sees to it that his face hits the mud every time down and 
CUT TO: 
INT. MESS HALL - DAY 
-- SANTIAGO sitting alone in the mess hall, not a friend within four seats of him and 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MARINE BARRACKS - DAY 
-- SANTIAGO being chewed out by a Lieutenant in front of his squad and 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ROCKY HILL - DAY 
-- SANTIAGO running with the squad of MARINES again, this time down a rocky hill. It's hot as hell and it looks like he's gonna pass out. 
He stumbles, and the SERGEANT picks him up and pushes him down the hill. He rolls about 30 feet before he stops. Over this, we HEAR 
SANTIAGO (V.O.) "...My name is PFC William T. Santiago. I am a marine stationed at Marine Barracks, Rifle Security Company Windward, Second Platoon Delta. I am writing to inform you of my problems with my unit here in Cuba and to ask for your help. I've fallen out on runs before for several reasons such as feeling dizzy or nauseated, but on May 18th, I'd fallen back about 20 or 30 yards going down a rocky, unstable hill. My sergeant grabbed me and pushed me down the hill. Then I saw all black and the last thing I remember is hitting the deck. I was brought to the hospital where I was told I just had heat exhaustion and was explained to by the doctor that my body has trouble with the hot sun and I hyperventilate. I ask you to help me. Please sir. I just need to be transferred out of RSC. Sincerely. PFC William T. Santiago. U.S. Marine Corps." 
At this point, with SANTIAGO's letter still in V.O., we

LOUDEN DOWNEY's a 19-year-old kid off an Iowa farm. He's happiest when someone is telling him exactly what to do. 
DAWSON's his hero. 
The two prisoners stand still for a moment. They might as we'll be in Oz. 
DOWNEY Hal? 
DAWSON doesn't say anything. 
DOWNEY (continuing) Is this Washington, D.C.? 
M.P. Alright, let's move. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY 
and KAFFEE's at it again. 
KAFFEE Alright, let's get tough out there! 
JO walks up from behind the backstop. 
JO Excuse me. 
KAFFEE You want to suit up? We need all the help we can get. 
JO No, thank you, I can't throw and catch things. 
KAFFEE That's okay, neither can they. 
JO I wanted to talk to you about Corporal Dawson and Private Downey. 
KAFFEE Say again? 
JO Dawson and Downey. 
KAFFEE (beat) Those names sound like they should mean something to me, but I'm just not -- 
JO Dawson! Downey! Your clients! 
KAFFEE The Cuba thing! Yes! Dawson and Downey. (beat) Right. (pause) I've done something wrong again, haven't I? 
JO I was wondering why two guys have been in a jail cell since this morning while their lawyer is outside hitting a ball. 
KAFFEE We need the practice. 
JO That wasn't funny. 
KAFFEE It was a little funny. 
JO Lieutenant, would you feel very insulted if I recommended to your supervisor that he assign different counsel? 
KAFFEE Why? 
JO I don't think you're fit to handle this defense. 
KAFFEE You don't even know me. Ordinarily it takes someone hours to discover I'm not fit to handle a defense. 
Jo just stares. 
KAFFEE (continuing) Oh come on, that was damn funny. 
Jo moves close to KAFFEE to say this with a degree of confidentiality. 
JO I do know you. Daniel AlliStair Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964 at Boston Mercy Hospital. Your father's Lionel Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate and Attorney General, of the United States, died 1985. You went to Harvard Law on a Navy scholarship, probably because that's what your father wanted you to do, and now you're just treading water for the three years you've gotta serve in the JAG Corps, just kinda layin' low til you can get out and get a real job. And if that's the situation, that's fine, I won't tell anyone. But my feeling is that if this case is handled in the same fast-food, slick-ass, Persian Bazaar manner with which you seem to handle everything else, something's gonna get missed. And I wouldn't be doing my job if I allowed Dawson and Downey to spend any more time in prison than absolutely necessary, because their attorney had pre- determined the path of least resistance. 
KAFFEE can't help but be impressed by that speech. 
KAFFEE Wow. (beat) I'm sexually aroused, Commander. 
JO I don't think your clients murdered anybody. 
KAFFEE What are you basing this on? 
JO There was no intent. 
KAFFEE The doctor's report says that Santiago died of asphyxiation brought on by acute lactic acidosis, and that the nature of the acidosis strongly suggests poisoning. (beat) Now, I don't know what any of that means, but it sounds pretty bad. 
JO Santiago died at one a.m. At three the doctor was unable to determine the cause of death, but two hours later he said it was poison. 
KAFFEE Oh, now I see what you're saying. It had to be Professor Plum in the library with the candlestick. 
JO I'm gonna speak to your supervisor. 
KAFFEE Okay. You go straight up Pennsylvania Avenue. It's a big white house with pillars in front. 
JO Thank you. 
KAFFEE I don't think you'll have much luck, though. I was assigned by Division, remember? Somebody over there thinks I'm a good lawyer. So while I appreciate your interest and admire your enthusiasm, I think I can pretty much handle things myself. 
JO Do you know what a code red is? 
KAFFEE doesn't, but he doesn't say anything. 
JO (continuing) What a pity. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE BRIG - DAY 
And an M.P. is leading KAFFEE and SAM down to DAWSON and DOWNEY's cell. 
M.P. Officer on deck, ten-hut. 
DAWSON No sir. 
KAFFEE What was your intent? 
DAWSON To train him, sir. 
KAFFEE Train him to do what? 
DAWSON Train him to think of his unit before himself. To respect the code. 
SAM What's the code? 
DAWSON Unit Corps God Country. 
SAM I beg your pardon? 
DAWSON Unit Corps God Country, sir. 
KAFFEE The Goverrment of the United States wants to charge you two with murder. You want me to go to the prosecutor with unit, corps, god, country? 
DAWSON stares at KAFFEE. 
DAWSON That's our code, sir. 
KAFFEE takes a long moment. He picks up his briefcase and he and SAM move to the door. 
KAFFEE We'll be back. You guys need anything? Books paper, cigarettes, a ham sandwich? 
DAWSON Sir. No thank you. Sir. 
KAFFEE smiles at DAWSON. 
KAFFEE Harold, I think there's a concept you better start warming up to. 
DAWSON Sir? 
KAFFEE I'm the only friend you've got. 
And as KAFFEE and SAM walk out the open cell door, DAWSON and DOWNEY come to attention and snap a salute. 
They hold the salute until KAFFEE and SAM are well out of sight, and we

INT.  KAFFEE'S OFFICE - DAY 
He's packing up stuff into his briefcase at the end of the work day. Lt. JACK ROSS, a marine lawyer maybe two years older than Kaffee, opens the door and walks in.. 
ROSS Dan Kaffee. 
KAFFEE Sailin' Jack Ross. 
ROSS Welcome to the big time. 
KAFFEE You think so? 
ROSS I hope for Dawson and Downey's sake you practice law better than you play softball. 
KAFFEE Unfortunately for Dawson and Downey, I don't do anything better than I play softball. What are we lookin' at? 
ROSS They plead guilty to manslaughter, I'll drop the conspiracy and the conduct unbecoming. 20 years, they'll be home in half that time. 
KAFFEE I want twelve. 
ROSS Can't do it. 
KAFFEE They called the ambulance, Jack. 
ROSS I don't care if they called the Avon Lady, they killed a marine. 
KAFFEE The rag was tested for poison.  The autopsy, lab report, even the initial E.R. and C.O.D. reports. They all say the same thing: Maybe, maybe not. 
ROSS The Chief of Internal Medicine at the Guantanamo Bay Naval hospital says he's sure. 
KAFFEE What do you know about Code Reds? 
ROSS smiles and shakes his head. 
ROSS Oh man. 
He closes the office door. 
ROSS (continuing) Are we off the record? 
KAFFEE You tell me. 
ROSS (pause) I'm gonna give you the twelve years, but before you go getting yourself into trouble tomorrow, you should know this: The platoon commander Lt. Jonathan Kendrick, had a meeting with the men. And he specifically told them not to touch Santiago. 
KAFFEE holds for a moment. Dawson and Downey neglected to mention this... He packs up his briefcase and cleats. 
KAFFEE I'll talk to you when I get back. 
ROSS Hey, we got a little four-on-four going tomorrow night. When does your plane get in? 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  THE PARKING LOT - DUSK 
It's dusk and people on the base are going home from work. We can see the flag being lowered in the background. 
KAFFEE's walking toward his car. JO intercepts him and starts walking along with him. 
JO Hi there. 
KAFFEE Any luck getting me replaced? 
KAFFEE It took albout 45 seconds. He barely put up a fight. 
SAM (beat) Danny, take the twelve years, it's a gift. 
KAFFEE finishes off his beer, and stands. 
KAFFEE You don't believe their story, do you? You think they ought to go to jail for the rest of their lives. 
SAM I believe every word they said. And I think they ought to go to jail for the rest of their lives. 
KAFFEE nods and puts down the empty beer bottle. 
KAFFEE I'll see you tomorrow. 
Sam opens the front door for him and they stand out on the stoop for a moment. 
SAM Remember to wear your whites, it's hot down there. 
KAFFEE I don't like the whites. 
SAM Nobody likes the whites, but we're going to Cuba in August. You got Dramamine? 
KAFFEE Dramamine keeps you cool? 
SAM Dramamine keeps you from throwing up, you get sick when you fly. 
KAFFEE I get sick when I fly because I'm afraid of crashing into a large mountain, I don't think Dramamine'll help. 
SAM I've got some oregano, I hear that works pretty good. 
KAFFEE Yeah, right. 
KAFFEE starts toward his car, then turns around. 
KAFFEE (continuing) You know, Ross said the strangest thing to me right before I left. He said the platoon commander Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick had a meeting with the men and specifically told them not to touch Santiago. 
SAM So? 
KAFFEE I never mentioned Kendrick. I don't even know who he is. (beat) What the hell. (beat) I'll see you tomorrow. 
We hold for a moment on KAFFEE as he walks to his car, then

EXT. THE AIRSTRIP AT GUANTANAMO BAY - DAY 
The whole place, in stark contrast to the Washington Navy Yard, is ready to go to war. Fighter jets line the tarmac. Ground crews re-fuel planes. Hurried activity. 
A 36 seat Airforce Jet rolls to a stop on the tarmac and a stair unit is brought up. 
HOWARD, a marine corporal, is waiting by the stairway as the passengers begin to got off. Mostly MARINES, a few SAILORS, a couple of CIVILIANS, and KAFFEE, JO and SAM. KAFFEE and SAM are wearing their summer whites, JO is in khakis. 
KAFFEE and SAM stare out at what they see: They're not in Kansas anymore. 
HOWARD shouts over the noise from the planes. 
HOWARD Lieutenants Kaffee and Weinberg? 
KAFFEE (shouting) Yeah. 
JO Commander Galloway. 
HOWARD I'm Corporal Howard, ma'am, I'm to escort you to the Windward side of the base. 
JO Thank you. 
HOWARD I've got some camouflage jackets in the back of the jeep, sirs, I'll have to ask you both to put them on. 
KAFFEE Camouflage jackets? 
HOWARD Regulations, sir. We'll be riding pretty close to the fenceline. The Cubans see an officer wearing white, they think it's someone they might wanna take a shot at. 
KAFFEE turns and glares at SAM. 
KAFFEE Good call, Sam.

EXT. CUBAN ROAD - THE JEEP - DAY 
Tearing along down the road, and now we see a beautiful expanse of water, maybe 1000 yards across. It's a section of Guantanamo Bay. 
HOWARD (shouting) We'll just hop on the ferry and be over there in no time. 
KAFFEE (shouting) Whoa! Hold it! We gotta take a boat?! 
HOWARD Yes sir, to get to the other side of the bay. 
KAFFEE Nobody said anything about a boat. 
HOWARD (shouting) Is there a problem, sir? 
KAFFEE (shouting) No. No problem. I'm just not that crazy about boats, that's all. 
JO (shouting) Jesus Christ, Kaffee, you're in the Navy for cryin' out loud! 
KAFFEE (shouting) Nobody likes her very much.

JESSEP, MARKINSON, KENDRICK and the LAWYERS are seated at a table in the corner. 
Stewards clear the lunch dishes and pour coffee. Jessep is finishing a story. 
JESSEP ...And they spent the next three hours running around, looking for Americans to surrender to. 
JESSEP laughs. KENDRICK joins him. SAM and KAFFEE force a laugh. 
MARKINSON forces a smile. JO remains silent. 
JESSEP (continuing; to the STEWARDS) That was delicious, men, thank you. 
STEWARD Our pleasure, sir. 
KAFFEE Colonel just need to ask you a couple of questions about August 6th. 
JESSEP Shoot. 
KAFFEE On the morning of the sixth, you were contacted by an NIS angent who said that Santiago had tipped him off to an illegal fenceline shooting. 
JESSEP Yes. 
KAFFEE Santiago was gonna reveal the person's name in exchange for a transfer. An I getting this right? 
JESSEP Yes. 
KAFFEE If you feel there are any details that I'm missing, you should free to speak up. 
JESSEP's not quite sure what to say to this Navy Lawyer Lieutenant-Smartass guy who just gave him permission to speak freely on his own base. 
JESSEP Thank you. 
KAFFEE Now it was at this point that you called Captain Markinson and Lt. Kendrick into your office? 
JESSEP Yes. 
KAFFEE And what happened then? 
JESSEP We agreed that for his own safety, Santiago should be transferred off the base. 
Here's something else KAFFEE didn't know. Neither did Jo. SAM jots something down on a small notepad. 
MARKINSON doesn't flinch. 
KAFFEE Santiago was set to be transferred? 
JESSEP On the first available flight to the states. Six the next morning. Three hours too late as it turned out. 
KAFFEE nods. 
KAFFEE Yeah. 
There's silence for a moment. 
KAFFEE takes a sip of his coffee. Then drains the cup and puts it down. 
KAFFEE (continuing) Alright, that's all I have. Thanks very much for your time. 
KENDRICK The corporal's got the jeep outside, he'll take you back to the airstrip. 
KAFFEE (standing) Thank you. 
JO Wait a minute, I've got some questions. 
KAFFEE No you don't. 
JO Yes I do. 
KAFFEE No you don't. 
JO Colonel, on the morning that Santiago died, did you meet with Doctor Stone between three and five? 
KAFFEE Jo -- 
JESSEP Of course I met with the doctor. One of my men was dead. 
KAFFEE (to JO) See? The man was dead. Let's go. 
JO (to JESSEP) I was wondering if you've ever heard the term Code Red. 
KAFFEE Jo -- 
JESSEP I've heard the term, yes. 
JO Colonel, this past February, you received a cautionary memo from the Naval Investigative Service, warning that the practice of enlisted men disciplining their own wasn't to be condoned by officers. 
JESSEP I submit to you that whoever wrote that memo has never served on the working end of a Soviet-made Cuban Ml-Al6 Assault Rifle. However, the directive having come from the NIS, I gave it its due attention. What's your point, Jo? 
KAFFEE She has no point. She often has no point. It's part of her charm. We're outta here. Thank you. 
JO My point is that I think code reds still go on down here. Do Code Reds still happen on this base, colonel? 
KAFFEE Jo, the colonel doesn't need to answer that. 
JO Yes he does. 
JO I already tried, I can't find him. 
KAFFEE You tried? Joanne, you're coming dangerously close to the textbook definition of interfering with a government investigation. 
JO hands KAFFEE the file she's been holding. 
JO I'm Louden Downey's attorney. 
KAFFEE's stunned. He opens the file and begins to read. 
JO (continuing) Aunt Ginny. She said she feels like she's known me for years. I suggested that she might feel more comfortable if I were directly involved with the case. She had Louden sign the papers about an hour ago. 
KAFFEE looks up. Still too stunned to say anything. Then finally... 
KAFFEE I suppose it's way too much to hope that you're just making this up to bother me. 
JO Don't worry, I'm not gonna make a motion for separation, you're still lead counsel. 
KAFFEE hands her back the file. 
KAFFEE Splendid. 
JO I think Kendrick ordered the Code Red. (beat) So do you.

KAFFEE starts in immediately. 
KAFFEE Did Kendrick order the code red? 
DAWSON Sir? 
KAFFEE Don't say sir like I just asked you if you cleaned the latrine. You heard what I said. Did Lt. Kendrick order you guys to give Santiago a code red? 
DAWSON Yes sir. 
KAFFEE (to Downey) Did he? 
DOWNEY Yes sir. 
KAFFEE You mind telling me why the hell you never mentioned this before? 
DAWSON You didn't ask us, sir. 
KAFFEE Cutie-pie shit's not gonna win you a place in my heart, corporal, I get paid no matter how much time you spend in jail. 
DAWSON Yes sir. I know you do, sir. 
KAFFEE Fuck you, Harold. 
There's some understandable tension in the room, broken by -- 
JO Alright. Let's sort this out. There was a platoon meeting on August 6th at four in the afternoon. And Lt. Kendrick, he gave strict instructions that nothing was to happen to Santiago. Now is that true? I want you to speak freely. 
DAWSON Ma'am, that's correct. But then he dismissed the platoon and we all went to our rooms. 
JO And what happened then? 
DAWSON Lt. Kendrick came to our room, ma'am. 
KAFFEE When? 
DAWSON About five minutes after the meeting broke, sir. About 16:20. 
KAFFEE (continuing) And what happened then? 
DAWSON Lt. Kendrick ordered us to give Santiago a Code Red.

INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT 
ROSS is playing a game of full-court basketball with some other OFFICERS. 
A door at the far end of the court opens and KAFFEE and JO walk in. They head down the sideline toward Ross. 
KAFFEE shouts -- 
KAFFEE Jack! 
But ROSS is into the game... 
KAFFEE (continuing) Jack!! 
ROSS (waving him off) Hang on... 
KAFFEE They were given an order. 
ROSS stops cold and looks over at Kaffee. The game flies by him. He motions to the locker room door in the corner of the gym and the three of them make their way to privacy. 
JO How long have you known about the order? 
ROSS I didn't -- (to KAFFEE) Who is this? 
KAFFEE This is Jo Galloway she's Downey's lawyer. She's very pleased to meet you. 
ROSS What exactly are you accusing me of, commander? 
JO I'm accusing you of -- 
KAFFEE Commander, I want to talk to corporal Dawson alone for a minute. 
Jo waits Just a moment before she calls out -- 
JO (to Downey) Let's go in another room. Louden, everything's gonna be alright. 
The M.P. has shown up and unlocked the cell door. 
JO (continuing; to M.P.) We're gonna go into a holding room. 
M.P. Aye, aye, ma'am. 
JO, DOWNEY, and the M.P. are gone. KAFFEE paces a moment before he says -- 
KAFFEE You don't like me that much, do you? (beat) Forget it, don't answer that, it doesn't matter. 
KAFFEE paces another moment, then sits on the cot. He's trying to choose his tack carefully. 
KAFFEE (continuing) You know, Downey worships you. He's gonna do whatever you do. Are you really gonna let this happen to him because of a code? Harold? 
DAWSON Do you think we were right? 
KAFFEE It doesn't matter what I -- 
DAWSON Do you think we were right? 
KAFFEE gets up. 
KAFFEE (beat) I think you'd lose. 
DAWSON (beat) You're such a coward, I can't believe they let you wear a uniform. 
KAFFEE stares at DAWSON. 
KAFFEE I'm not gonna feel responsible for this, Harold. I did everything I could. You're going to Levenworth for the better part of your life, and you know what? I don't give a shit. 
KAFFEE calls out --

KAFFEE and DAWSON are staring each other down. The M.P. shows up and unlocks the cell door. KAFFEE steps out to leave. 
KAFFEE (continuing) What happened to saluting an officer when he leaves the room?

SAM You just make a motion tomorrow morning at the arraignment. The judge'll ask you if you want to enter a plea. You tell him you want new counsel assigned. 
KAFFEE (beat) Then that's that. 
JO (beat) Yeah. One thing, though. When you ask the judge for new counsel, Danny, be sure and ask nicely. 
KAFFEE What do you want from me? 
JO I want you to let 'em be judged! I want you to stand up and make an argument! 
SAM An argument that didn't work for Calley at My Lai, an argument that didn't work for the Nazis at Nuremberg. 
KAFFEE For Christ sake, Sam, do you really think that's the same as two teenage marines executing a routine order that they never believed would result in harm? These guys aren't the Nazis. 
There's a pause in the room. 
JO Don't look now, Danny, but you're making an argument. 
KAFFEE (pause) Yeah. (beat) Tomorrow morning I'll get them a new attorney. 
JO Why are you so afraid to be a lawyer? Were daddy's expectations really that high? 
KAFFEE Please, spare me the psycho-babble father bullshit. Dawson and Downey'll have their day in court, but they'll have it with another lawyer. 
JO Another lawyer won't be good enough. They need you. You know how to win. (beat) You know they have a case. And you know how to win. You walk away from this now, and you have sealed their fate. 
KAFFEE Their fate was sealed the moment Santiago died. 
JO Do you believe they have a defense? 
KAFFEE You and Dawson both live in the same dreamland. It doesn't matter what I believe, it only matters what I can prove. So please don't tell me what I know and don't know. I know the law. 
JO looks at him, shakes her head, and turns to walk away. She turns back. 
JO You know nothing about the law. You're a used car salesman, Daniel. You're an ambulance chaser with a rank. You're nothing. (beat) Live with that. 
Jo walks off leaving KAFFEE alone. We HOLD on KAFFEE. He's not having a good night. 
CUT TO: 
INT. A GEORGETOWN BAR - NIGHT 
KAFFEE sits at the bar. The place is crowded with YUPPIES and STUDENTS. KAFFEE's been drinking there a while now. Next to him is a YUPPIE LAWYER, regaling his FRIENDS with the story of his latest brilliant maneuver in the world of high stakes corporate law. 
We HOLD on a KAFFEE a moment longer, then 
KAFFEE (continuing; pause) I need you. You're better at research than I am and you know how to prepare a witness. 
Jo lets herself in. She's carrying a huge stack of papers under one arm, and a large brown paper bag under the other. But we stay with KAFFEE and Sam a moment longer. 
JO I've got medical reports and Chinese food. I say we eat first. 
KAFFEE's still looking at SAM. SAM nods his head. 
SAM Did you get any dumplings? 
CUT TO: 
INT. KAFFEE'S APT. - LATER - NIGHT 
The remnants of the Chinese food is spread around. SAM and JO are sitting and taking notes from KAFFEE. As he speaks, he'll pace slowly around, carrying his baseball bat. He refers to the blackboard. 
KAFFEE This is our defense. Intent: No one can prove there was poison on the raq. Code Red: They're common and accepted in Guantanamo Bay. The Order: (he writes) A) Kendrick gave it. B) They had no choice but to follow it. (beat) That's it. 
SAM What about motive? 
KAFFEE We're a little weak on motive. They had one. 
JO Just because a person has a motive doesn't mean -- 
KAFFEE Relax. We'll deal with the fenceline shooting when it comes up. For now we start here -- (pointing to INTENT) I don't know what made Santiago die, I don't want to know. I just want to be able to show it could've been something other than poison. Jo, talk to doctors. Find out everything there is to know about lactic acidosis. Let's start prepping for Stone. 
JO As long as we're on the subject of the doctor -- 
KAFFEE Here we go. 
JO Listen to me, three o'clock he doesn't know what killed Santiago, then he meets with Jessep, and at five o'clock he says it was poison? The doctor's covering up the truth. 
KAFFEE Oh, that's a relief. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to use the "Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire" defense. We can't prove coercion!! Alright, fitness reports and biographical information. 
SAM Cartons 3 and 4. 
KAFFEE looks at the cartons and the mind-numbing amount of paper.

KAFFEE Bruises? Broken bones? 
SAM No. 
JO (into phone) No, please don't put me on hold --

JO Nice.

INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
RANDOLPH enters. 
SERGEANT AT ARMS All rise. 
ROSS Too late. 
KAFFEE walks back to his table as 
SERGEANT AT ARMS All those having business with this general court-martial, stand forward and you shall be heard. Captain Julius Alexander Randolph is presiding. God save the United States of America. 
RANDOLPH raps the gavel. 
RANDOLPH without objection, the sworn confessions of the two defendants have been read to the jury and entered into the court record. 
ROSS No objection, your honor. 
KAFFEE No objection. 
RANDOLPH Is the Government prepared to make an opening statement? 
ROSS (standing) Yes sir. 
ROSS walks to the jury box. 
ROSS (continuing) The facts of the case are this: At midnight on August 6th, the defendants went into the barracks room of their platoon-mate, PFC William Santiago. They woke him up, tied his arms and legs with rope, and forced a rag into his throat. A few minutes later, a chemical reaction in Santiago's body called lactic acidosis caused his lungs to begin bleeding. He drowned in his own blood and was pronounced dead at 32 minutes past midnight. These are the facts of the case. And they are undisputed. That's right. The story I just told you is the exact same story you're going to hear from Corporal Dawson, and it's the exact same story you're going to hear from Private Downey. Furthermore, the Government will also demonstrate that the defendants soaked the rag with poison, and entered Santiago's room with motive and intent to kill. (beat) Now, Lt. Kaffee, is gonna try to pull off a little magic act, he's gonna try a little misdirection. He's going to astonish you with stories of rituals and dazzle you with official sounding terms like Code Red. He might even cut into a few officers for you. He'll have no evidence, mind you, none. But it's gonna be entertaining. When we get to the end, all the magic in the world will not have been able to divert your attention from the fact that Willy Santiago is dead, and Dawson and Downey killed him. These are the facts of the case. (beat) And they are undisputed. 
ROSS walks back to his seat. 
RANDOLPH Lt. Kaffee? 
Before KAFFEE's even stood up, these words are coming out of his mouth. 
KAFFEE There was no poison on the rag and there was no intent to kill and any attempt to prove otherwise is futile because it just ain't true. (beat) When Dawson and Downey went into Santiago's room that night, it wasn't because of vengeance or hatred, it wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't because they were looking for kicks on a Friday night. It's because it was what they were ordered to do. (beat) Let me say that again: It's because it was what they were ordered to do. Now, out in the real world, that means nothing. And here at the Washington Navy Yard, it doesn't mean a whole lot more. But if you're a marine assigned to Rifle Security Company Windward, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and you're given an order, you follow it or you pack your bags. (beat) Make no mistake about it, Harold Dawson and Louden Downey are sitting before you in judgement today because they did their job. 
KAFFEE walks back to the table and takes his seat. 
RANDOLPH Is the Government ready to call its first witness? 
ROSS Please the Court, the Government calls Mr. R.C McGuire. 
While McCGUIRE, a civilian in his late 30's, is being sworn in, KAFFEE has sat back down. 
He leans over to DAWSON and whispers. 
KAFFEE How you doin'? 
DAWSON doesn't change his expression. 
KAFFEE (continuing) Good. 
ROSS Mr. McGuire, would you state your full name and occupation for the record, please? 
MCGUIRE Robert C. McGuire, Special Agent, Naval Investigative Service. 
ROSS Mr. McGuire, did your office receive a letter from PFC William Santiago on 3 August of this year? 
MCGUIRE We did. 
ROSS What did the letter say? 
MCGUIRE That a member of Private Santiago's unit had illegally fired his weapon over the fenceline. 
ROSS Was that marine identified in the letter? 
MCGUIRE No sir. I notified the barracks C.O., Colonel Jessep, that I would be coming down to investigate. 
ROSS And what did you find? 
MCGUIRE For the shift reported, only one sentry returned his weapon to the switch with a round of ammunition missing. 
ROSS And who was that? 
MCGUIRE Lance Corporal Harold Dawson. 
ROSS (continuing; to KAFFEE) Your witness. 
ROSS goes back to his table. KAFFEE stands. 
KAFFEE Mr. McGuire, have you questioned Corporal Dawson about the fenceline shooting? 
MCGUIRE Yes. He claims to have been engaged in some manner by the enemy. 
KAFFEE But you don't believe him. 
MCGUIRE It's not my place -- 
KAFFEE Corporal Dawson's been charged with a number of crimes, why wasn't he charged with firing at the enemy without cause? 
MCGUIRE There wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge. 
KAFFEE Thank you. 
KAFFEE sits. 
ROSS Mr. McGuire, I don't understand what you mean when you say there wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge. You had Willy Santiago's letter. 
MCGUIRE Santiago was the only witness, but I never had a chance to interview him. So I don't know what he saw. 
ROSS And now we won't ever know, will we, Mr. McGuire? 
MCGUIRE No. 
ROSS No more questions. 
CUT TO: 
KAFFEE sits. 
ROSS Doctor Stone, did Willy Santiago die of poisoning? 
STONE Absolutely. 
ROSS Are you aware that the lab report and the coroners report showed no traces of poison? 
STONE Yes I am. 
ROSS Then how do you justify -- 
STONE There are literally dozens of toxins which are virtually undetectable, both in the human body and on a fabric. The nature of the acidosis is the compelling factor in this issue. 
ROSS Thank you, sir. 
KAFFEE gets up. 
KAFFEE Commander, you testified that it takes lactic acidosis 20 to 30 minutes before it becomes lethal. 
STONE Yes. 
KAFFEE Let me ask you, is it possible for a person to have an affliction, some sort of condition, which might, in the case of this person, actually speed up the process of acidosis dramatically? 
STONE says nothing for a moment. 
KAFFEE (continuing) Commander, is it possible? 
STONE Certainly. 
KAFFEE What might some of those conditions be? 
STONE (beat) If a person had a coronary disorder... or a cerebral disorder, the process would be more rapid. 
KAFFEE Commander, if I had a coronary condition, and a perfectly clean rag was placed in my mouth, and the rag was accidentally pushed too far down, is it possible that my cells would continue burning sugar after the rag was taken out? 
STONE It would have to be a very serious condition. 
KAFFEE Is it possible to have a serious coronary condition, where the initial warning signals were so mild as to escape a physician during a routine medical exam? 
STONE Possibly. There would still be symptoms though. 
KAFFEE What kind of symptoms? 
STONE There are hundreds of symptoms of a -- 
KAFFEE Chest pains? 
STONE (beat) Yes. 
KAFFEE Shortness of breath? 
STONE Yes. 
KAFFEE Fatigue? 
STONE Of course. 
KAFFEE has gone back to his table where JO has handed him some documents. He shows then to STONE. 
KAFFEE Doctor, is this your signature? 
STONE Yes it is. 
KAFFEE This in an order for Private Santiago to be put on restricted duty. Would you read your hand written remarks at the bottom of the page, please, sir. 
STONE (reading) "Initial testing negative. Patient complains of chest pains, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Restricted from running distances over five miles for one week." 
KAFFEE Commander, isn't it possible that Santiago had a serious coronary condition, and it was that condition, and not some mysterious poison, that caused the accelerated chemical reaction? 
STONE No. I personally give the men a physical examination every three months. And every three months Private Santiago got a clean bill of health. 
KAFFEE And that's why it had to be, poison, right, Commander? 'Cause Lord knows, if you put a man with a serious coronary condition back on duty with a clean bill of health, and that man died from a heart related incident, you'd have a lot to answer for, wouldn't you, doctor? 
ROSS Object. Move to strike. 
RANDOLPH Sustained. Strike it. 
KAFFEE No more questions, judge. 
ROSS stands immediately. 
ROSS Dr. Stone, you've held a license to practice medicine for 21 years, you are Board Certified in Internal Medicine, you are the Chief of Internal Medicine at a hospital which serves over 8000 men. In your professional opinion, was Willy Santiago poisoned? 
Jo stands. 
JO Your Honor, we re-new our objection to Commander Stone's testimony, and ask that it be stricken from the record. And we further ask that the Court instruct the jury to lend no weight to this witness's testimony. 
KAFFEE and SAM are dying, but they're trying to keep their poker-faces. RANDOLPH'S gonna try to be polite about this, but he thought he made himself clear. 
RANDOLPH The objection's overruled, counsel. 
JO Sir, the defense strenuously objects and requests a meeting in chambers so that his honor might have an opportunity to hear discussion before ruling on the objection. 
RANDOLPH The objection of the defense has been heard and overruled. 
JO Exception. 
RANDOLPH Noted. The witness is an expert and the court will hear his opinion. 
ROSS Doctor, in your expert, professional opinion, was Willy Santiago poisoned? 
STONE Yes. 
ROSS Thank you, sir, I have no more questions. 
KAFFEE We've got the transfer order. It's got your signature. 
MARKINSON I know. I signed it the morning you arrived in Cuba. Six days after Santiago died. 
KAFFEE's wheels are spinning. He's pumped. 
KAFFEE I'm gonna get you a deal. Some kind of immunity with the prosecutor. In about four days, you're gonna appear as a witness for the defense, and you're gonna tell the court exactly what you told me. Right now I'm gonna check you into a motel, and we're gonna start from the beginning. 
MARKINSON I don't want a deal. And I don't want immunity. 
KAFFEE shakes his head and laughs. 
MARKINSON (continuing) I want you to know, I'm proud neither of what I've done nor what I'm doing. 
KAFFEE puts the car in gear and we

Where KAFFEE has just finished telling his story to an amazed SAM and JO. 
There's silence. 
Then JO has a total adrenaline rush. 
JO Where is he? 
KAFFEE The Route 23 Best Western. 
JO picks up the phone. 
JO I want him guarded. 
KAFFEE That's probably a good idea. 
JO (into phone) This is Lt. Commander Joanne Galloway. My clearance code is 411273. 
KAFFEE is impressed. He turns to SAM -- 
KAFFEE Clearance code? 
JO Thank you. 
KAFFEE (to SAM) I don't have a clearance code. Do you have a -- 
JO (into phone) It's Jo Galloway. I need to secure a witness. 
Jo continues giving information to the person on the phone, while Kaffee keeps talking to the both of them. Sam is writing down notes as fast as he can. 
KAFFEE He also said that Jessep's lying about the transportation off the base. Jessep said six the next morning was the first flight Santiago could've left on, Markinson says there was a plane that left seven hours earlier. 
JO hangs up the phone. 
JO Damn. 
KAFFEE That was impressive. Did you hear what I just said about the flight? 
JO Yes. 
KAFFEE Sam, when a plane takes off from a base, there's gotta be some kind of record kept, right? 
SAM We need the Tower Chief's Log for GITMO. 
KAFFEE (to SAM) Get it. 
JO We're gonna win. 
KAFFEE Jo, don't get crazy about this. We don't know who Markinson is. We don't know what the log book's gonna say. You just concentrate on Downey. I'm gonna talk to Ross and tell him where we are. 
JO (sing-song) "Kaffee's got his case now, Kaffee's got his case now." 
KAFFEE You are like seven of the strangest women I have ever met.

INT. A WASHINGTON SALOON - NIGHT 
A WAITRESS sets two drinks down in front of KAFFEE and ROSS, who are sitting across from each other in a booth in the back. 
ROSS That was nice work today. The redirect on Howard. 
KAFFEE I have Markinson. 
ROSS only takes a moment digest this. 
ROSS Where is he? 
KAFFEE A motel room in Arlington with 14 Federal Marshals outside his door. Take a sip of your drink. 
ROSS Damn. 
KAFFEE The transfer order that Parkinson signed is phoney. And Jessep's statement that the six a.m. flight was the first available is a lie, we're checking the tower chief's log. But in the meantime I'm gonna put the Apostle Jon Kendrick on the stand and see if we can't have a little fun. 
ROSS takes another sip of his drink, then lays it on the line for Kaffee.. 
ROSS I have an obligation to tell you that if you accuse Kendrick or Jessep of any crime without proper evidence, you'll be subject to Court-Martial for professional misconduct. And that's something that'll be stapled to every job application you ever fill out. Markinson's not gonna hold up, he's a crazy man. I'm not saying this to intimidate you. I'm being your lawyer. 
KAFFEE Thanks, Jack. And I wanna tell you that I think the whole fuckin' bunch of you are certifiably insane. And this code of honor of yours makes me wanna beat the shit outta something. 
ROSS Don't you dare lump me in with Jessep and Markinson and Kendrick because we wear the same uniform. I'm your friend, Danny, and I'm telling you, I don't think your clients belong in jail. But I don't get to make that decision. I represent the Government of the United States. Without passion or prejudice. And my client has a case. (pause) I want you to acknowledge that the judge advocate has made you aware of the possible consequences involved in accusing a marine officer of a felony without proper evidence. 
KAFFEE I've been so advised. 
ROSS stands up and heaves a few dollars on the table. 
KAFFEE What crime did he commit? (beat) Lieutenant Kendrick? (beat) Dawson brought a hungry guy some food. What crime did he commit? 
KENDRICK He disobeyed an order. 
KAFFEE And because he did, because he exercised his own set of values, because he made a decision about the welfare of a marine that was in conflict with an order of yours, he was punished, is that right? 
KENDRICK Corporal Dawson disobeyed an order. 
KAFFEE Yeah, but it wasn't a order, was it? After all, it's peacetime. He wasn't being asked to secure a hill... or advance on a beachhead. I mean, surely a marine of Dawson's intelligence can be trusted to determine on his own, which are the really important orders, and which orders might, say, be morally questionable. (beat) Lt. Kendrick? (beat) Can he? Can Corporal Dawson determine on his own which orders he's gonna follow? (pause) 
KENDRICK No, he can not. 
KAFFEE A lesson he learned after the Curtis Barnes incident, am I right? 
KENDRICK I would think so. 
KAFFEE You know so, don't you, Lieutenant. 
ROSS Object! 
RANDOLPH Sustained. 
KAFFEE Lieutenant Kendrick, one final question: if you ordered Dawson to give Santiago a code red... 
ROSS -- please the court -- 
KENDRICK I told those men not to touch Santiago. 
KAFFEE -- is it reasonable to think that he would've disobeyed you again? 
ROSS Lieutenant, don't answer that. 
KAFFEE You don't have to, I'm through. 
ROSS doesn't even wait before he says -- 
ROSS Lieutenant Kendrick, did you order Corporal Dawson and Private Downey to give Willy Santiaga code red? 
But KENDRICK isn't listening -- he's glaring at Kaffee. 
ROSS (continuing) Lt. Kendrick, did you -- 
KENDRICK No I did not. 
ROSS Thank you.

KAFFEE pays no attention and bangs on MARKINSON's door. The door opens and KAFFEE walks into 
INT. MOTEL ROOM 
HE tosses the log book on the table. 
KAFFEE There was no flight out at eleven o'clock. What the fuck are you trying to pull? 
MARKINSON The first flight stateside left Guantanamo Bay at eleven and arrived at Andrews Airforce Base, Maryland, at a few minutes past two. 
KAFFEE Then why the hell isn't it listed in the Tower Chief's log?! 
MARKINSON Why the hell did you think it would be?!! 
KAFFEE is silent. And now it begins to sink in. 
KAFFEE What are you telling me? (beat) He fixed the log book? 
Setback. Big setback. 
KAFFEE (continuing) Well, maybe he can make it so a plane didn't take off, but I can sure as hall prove that one landed. I'll get the log book from Andrews. 
MARKINSON says nothing. But his face says that KAFFEE was born yesterday. 
KAFFEE (continuing; beat) He made an entire flight disappear? 
MARKINSON Nathan Jessep is about to be named Director of Operations for the National Security Council. You don't get to that position without knowing how to side-step a few land mines. (beat) And putting me on the stand isn't gonna make him step on one.

EXT. THE COURTROOM - DAY 
Kaffee is at the end of his examination of Downey. 
KAFFEE Private, I want you to tell us one last time: Why did you go into Private Santiago's room on the night of August 6th? 
DOWNEY A code red was ordered by my platoon commander, Lt. Jonathan James Kendrick. 
KAFFEE Thank you. (to ROSS) Your witness. 
ROSS Private, for the week of 2 August, the switch log has you down at Post 39, is that correct? 
DOWNEY I'm sure it is, sir, they keep that log pretty good. 
ROSS How far is it from Post 39 to the Windward barracks? 
DOWNEY It's a ways, sir, it's a hike. 
ROSS About how far by jeep? 
DOWNEY About ten, fifteen minutes, sir. 
ROSS Have you ever had to walk it? 
DOWNEY Yes sir. That day, sir. Friday. The Pick-up Private -- sir, that's what we call the fella who drops us at our posts and picks us up... also, 'cause he can get girls in New York City -- the Pick-up Private got a flat... 
At the defense table, KAFFEE, poker-faced, scribbles something down on a piece of paper and slides it to JO. JO looks at it: 
"Where's he going with this?" JO scribbles "?" And hands it back to KAFFEE. 
DOWNEY (continuing) ...Right at 39. He pulled up and blam! ...A blowout-with no spare. The two of us had to double-time it back to the barracks. 
ROSS And if it's ten or fifteen minutes by jeep, I'm guessing it must be a good hour by foot, am I right? 
DOWNEY Pick-up and me did it in 45 flat, sir. 
ROSS Not bad. Now you say your assault on Private Santiago was the result of an order that Lt. Kendrick gave in your barracks room at 16:20. 
KAFFEE knows what's coming. There's nothing he can do about it. And he can't lose his cool in front of the jury. 
DOWNEY Yes sir. 
JO. Helpless. Panicked. 
ROSS But you just said that you didn't make it back to Windward Barracks until 16:45. 
DOWNEY's confused. These are questions he hasn't been asked before. 
DOWNEY Sir? 
ROSS If you didn't make it back to your barracks until 16:45, then how could you be in your room at 16:20? 
DOWNEY (pause) You see sir, there was a flat tire. 
ROSS Private, did you ever actually hear Lt. Kendrick order a Code Red? 
KAFFEE's world is falling down around him, and there's nothing he can do about it. And he knows it. 
DOWNEY (pause) No, sir. 
Jo leaps to her feet. 
JO Please the court, I'd like to request a recess in order to confer with my client. 
ROSS Why did you go into Santiago's room? 
JO The witness has rights. 
ROSS The witness has been read his rights, commander. 
DOWNEY (confused) Hal? 
RANDOLPH The question will be repeated. 
ROSS Why did you go into Santiago's room? 
JO Your honor -- 
DOWNEY Hal? 
ROSS Did Corporal Dawson tell you to do it? 
Everyone is frozen. 
ROSS (continuing) He did, didn't he? Dawson told you to give Santiago a code red. 
DOWNEY looks at DAWSON. 
DOWNEY Hal? 
ROSS Don't look at him. 
DOWNEY Hal? 
DAWSON Private. Answer the Lieutenant's question. 
The room is still silent. DOWNEY does something we've never seen him do before. He straightens himself up and says this with the pride of a man who believes he's done the right thing. 
DOWNEY Yes, Lieutenant. I was given an order by my squad leader, Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson of the U.S. Marine Corps. And I followed it. 
There's dead silence. Maybe just the sound of KAFFEE breathing after this exhausting outburst. 
Finally... 
JO I'm sorry I lost you your set of steak knives. 
Jo picks up her purse and coat and walks out. The door slams behind her. 
KAFFEE walks into the kitchen without a word. 
SAM gets down on the floor and begins picking up all the stuff that Kaffee knocked off the desk. 
KAFFEE comes back in with a bottle of Jack Daniels. 
KAFFEE Stop cleaning up. 
But Sam continues. 
KAFFEE (continuing) Sam. Stop cleaning up. 
SAM stops and sits in a chair. KAFFEE sits on the couch. 
KAFFEE (continuing) You want a drink? 
SAM Yeah. 
SAM takes a swig from the bottle. 
KAFFEE Is your father proud of you? 
SAM Don't do this to yourself. 
KAFFEE I'll bet he is. I'll bet he bores the shit outta the neighbors and the relatives. "Sam, made Law Review. He's got a big case he's making -- He's arguing making an argument." (pause) I think my father would've enjoyed seeing me graduate from law school. (beat) I think he would've liked that... an awful lot. 
SAM Did I ever tell you that I wrote a paper on your father in college? 
KAFFEE Yeah? 
SAM He was one of the best trial lawyers ever. 
KAFFEE Yes he was. 
SAM And if I were Dawson and Downey and I had a choice between you or your father to represent me in this case, I'd take you any day of the week and twice on Sunday. You should have seen yourself thunder away at Kendrick. 
KAFFEE Would you put Jessep on the stand? 
SAM No. 
KAFFEE You think my father would've? 
SAM With the evidence we've got? Not in a million years. But here's the thing -- and there's really no way of getting around this -- neither Lionel Kaffee nor Sam Weinberg are lead counsel for the defense in the matter of U.S. versus Dawson and Downey. So there's only one question. What would you do? 
We HOLD on the two of them for a moment, then 
CUT TO: 
EXT. A SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 
JO is walking through the night at a brisk pace. She's doing her best not to fall apart. 
TWO HEADLIGHTS appear coming down the street, and KAFFEE's CAR, with SAM driving and KAFFEE riding shotgun, slows down alongside JO. KAFFEE rolls down his window. 
KAFFEE Joanne. 
JO ignores them and keeps walking. The car crawls along with her. 
JO starts walking faster. 
KAFFEE (continuing) Jo, we look ridiculous. (to SAM) Stop the car. 
KAFFEE hops out and calls -- 
KAFFEE (continuing) Joanne. 
JO keeps walking. 
KAFFEE (continuing) I apologize. I was angry and... I'm sorry about what I said. 
But JO'S still walking. 
KAFFEE (continuing; calling) I'm gonna put Jessep on the stand. 
She stops. She turns around. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - LATER - AFTERNOON 
A nerf ball bounces off the wall. 
KAFFEE, JO and SAM are sprawled out in the living room. For hours now they've been trying to come up with an idea. KAFFEE's mind seems to be on his basketball game. 
JO I say we hit him with the phoney transfer order. 
SAM What's the transfer order without a witness? 
KAFFEE We have a witness. 
SAM A dead witness. 
KAFFEE And in the hands of a lesser attorney, that'd be a problem. 
SAM Look at this. Last night he was swimming in his Jack Daniels, now he can leap tall buildings in a single bound. 
KAFFEE I'm getting my second wind. Siddown. Both of you. 
RANDOLPH Lt. Kaffee? 
KAFFEE says nothing. He glances over to AIRMEN O'MALLEY and PEREZ. 
RANDOLPH (continuing) Lieutenant, do you have anything further for this witness? 
KAFFEE doesn't respond. JESSEP gets up to leave. 
JESSEP (standing) Thanks, Danny. I love Washington. 
And JESSEP starts to leave, but he's stopped by -- 
KAFFEE Excuse me, I didn't dismiss you. 
JESSEP turns around. 
JESSEP I beg your pardon. 
KAFFEE I'm not through with my examination. Sit down. 
JESSEP Colonel. 
KAFFEE What's that? 
JESSEP (to RANDOLPH) I'd appreciate it if he addressed me as Colonel or Sir. I believe I've earned it. 
RANDOLPH Defense counsel will address the witness as Colonel or Sir. 
JESSEP (to RANDOLPH) I don't know what the hell kind of an outfit you're running here. 
RANDOLPH And the witness will address this Court as Judge or Your Honor. I'm quite certain I've earned it. Take your seat, Colonel. 
Jessep goes back to the stand. 
JESSEP (continuing) What would you like to discuss now! My favorite color? 
KAFFEE Colonel, the six a.m. flight, was the first one off the base? 
JESSEP Yes. 
KAFFEE There wasn't a flight that left seven hours earlier and landed at Andrews Airforce Base at 2 a.m.? 
RANDOLPH Lieutenant, I think we've covered this, haven't we? 
KAFFEE gets the two log books from his table as well as the piece of paper that SAM scribbled on. 
KAFFEE Your Honor, these are the Tower Chief's Logs for both Guantanamo Bay and Andrews Airforce Base. The Guantanamo log lists no flight that left at eleven p.m., and the Andrews log lists no flight that landed at 2 a.m. I'd like to admit them as Defense Exhibits "A" and "B". 
RANDOLPH I don't understand. You're admitting evidence of a flight that never existed? 
KAFFEE We believe it did, sir. (glancing at the paper, then motioning to the AIRMEN) Defense'll be calling Airman Cecil O'Malley and Airman Anthony Perez. They were working the ground crew at Andrews at two a.m. on the seventh. 
ROSS Your Honor, these men weren't on the list. Rebuttal witnesses, Your Honor, called specifically to refute testimony offered under direct examination. 
If you looked closely at JESSEP, you could see a drop of sweat. 
RANDOLPH I'll allow the witnesses. 
JESSEP This is ridiculous. 
KAFFEE Colonel, a moment ago -- 
JESSEP Check the Tower Logs for christ's sake. 
KAFFEE We'll get to the airmen in just a minute, sir. A moment ago said that you ordered Kendrick to order his men not to touch Santiago. 
JESSEP That's right. 
KAFFEE And Kendrick was clear on what you wanted? 
JESSEP Crystal. 
KAFFEE Any chance Kendrick ignored the order? 
JESSEP Ignored the order? 
KAFFEE Any chance he just forgot about it? 
JESSEP No. 
KAFFEE Any chance Kendrick left your office and said, "The 'old man's wrong"? 
JESSEP No. 
KAFFEE When Kendrick spoke to the platoon and ordered them not to touch Santiago, any chance they ignored him? 
JESSEP Have you ever spent time in an infantry unit, son? 
KAFFEE No sir. 
JESSEP Ever served in a forward area? 
KAFFEE No sir. 
JESSEP Ever put your life in another man's hands, ask him to put his life in yours? 
KAFFEE No sir. 
JESSEP We follow orders, son. We follow orders or people die. It's that simple. Are we clear? 
KAFFEE Yes sir. 
JESSEP Are we clear? 
KAFFEE Crystal. 
KAFFEE (as a friend) Jack. 
ROSS looks at KAFFEE, then JESSEP, then nods his head "yes" to RANDOLPH. 
RANDOLPH The Sergeant at Arms will take the jury to an ante-room where you'll wait until further instruction. 
The SERGEANT AT ARMS begins leading the JURORS out of the room. 
JESSEP What the hell's going on? 
No one will say anything until the jurors are out of the room. 
JESSEP (continuing; to captain) Captain, what the hell's going on? I did my job. I'd do it again. Now I'm getting on a plane and going back to my base. 
RANDOLPH M.P.'s, guard the prisoner. 
The M.P.'s are tentative. They've never heard a marine colonel referred to as "the prisoner" before. They sure as hell have never been asked to guard one. 
ROSS Guard the prisoner. 
JESSEP What the hell -- 
ROSS Colonel Jessep, you have the right to remain silent. Any statement you do make can be used against you in a trial by court-martial or other judicial or administrative proceeding. You have the right... 
ROSS continues reading JESSEP his rights, over -- 
JESSEP I'm being charged with a crime? I'm -- that's what this is -- (to Ross) Marine! (Ross keeps going) Marine!! (Ross is doing his job.) I'm being charged with a crime? I'm -- that's what's happening? This -- I'm -- this is funny, you know that, this is -- 
And JESSEP lunges at KAFFEE, and KAFFEE would be dead but for the three M.P.'s who've leapt in to restrain JESSEP. SAM and JO have come to their feet and stand behind KAFFEE. 
JESSEP (continuing; to Kaffee) I'm gonna tear your eyes right outta your head and piss in your dead skull. You fucked with the wrong marine. 
ROSS is done reading JESSEP his rights. 
ROSS Colonel Jessep, do you understand those rights as I have just read then to you? 
JESSEP I saved lives. That boy was -- there was a weak link. I saved lives, you hear me? 
The courtroom is silent from Jessep's outburst. Jessep shakes his head. 
JESSEP (continuing) You fuckin' people. (beat) You have no idea how to defend a nation. (continuing; to KAFFEE) All you did was weaken a country today, Kaffee. That's all you did. You put people in danger. Sweet dreams, son. 
KAFFEE Don't call me son. (beat) I'm a lawyer, and an officer of the United States Navy. And you're under arrest you sonofabitch. 
KAFFEE stays on JESSEP a moment longer, then remembers -- 
KAFFEE (continuing) The witness is excused. 
The M.P.'s start leading JESSEP out, and KAFFEE notices DAWSON. And DOWNEY. And ROSS. who are watching a man in a marine colonels uniform be led away in handcuffs... KAFFEE takes a handkerchief from his pocket and wipes some sweat from his hands. He takes a deep breath as we 
SLOW DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. THE COURTROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
There's low murmur in the room as the JURORS are being led back into their box. 
Everyone's in place. 
RANDOLPH enters. 
SERGEANT AT ARMS Ten-hut. 
All rise. And sit when RANDOLPH sits. 
RANDOLPH Have the jurors reached a verdict? 
JURY FOREMAN We have, sir. 
The SERGEANT AT ARMS takes all the slips of paper from the FOREMAN and brings them to RANDOLPH. 
KAFFEE stands, and nods to DAWSON and DOWNEY that they should do the same. SAM and JO stand as well. 
RANDOLPH (reading) On the charge of Murder, the Members find the defendants Not Guilty. 
It's hard to resist the temptation to scream and shout, but they do. 
RANDOLPH (continuing; reading) On the charge of Conspiracy to Commit Murder, the Members find the defendants Not Guilty. 
RANDOLPH looks up. Then reads from the last slip of paper. 
RANDOLPH (continuing) On the charge of Conduct Unbecoming a United States Marine, the members find the defendants Guilty as Charged. 
A little of the energy drains out of the room. RANDOLPH continues reading. 
RANDOLPH (continuing; reading) The defendants are hereby sentenced by this court to time already served, and are ordered... 
RANDOLPH clears his throat. 
RANDOLPH (continuing) ...And are ordered to be dishonorably discharged from the marine corps. (pause) This Court-Martial is adjourned. 
RANDOLPH raps his gavel. 
SERGEANT AT ARMS Ten hut. 
All rise. 
RANDOLPH's gone. 
SERGEANT AT ARMS (continuing) Dismissed. 
The M.P.'s move to DAWSON and DOWNEY to unlock their handcuffs. KAFFEE is packing up his things, just another day at the office. 
DAWSON Why? 
KAFFEE Harold, I'm sorry.

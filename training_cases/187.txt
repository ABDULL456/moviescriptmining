FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY 
Rev. 7/10/96 
1   EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN SKYLINE - BROOKLYN BRIDGE - MORNING    1 RUSH HOUR 
ON a pair of black Dexter penny loafers diligently pedaling an old Schwinn mountain bike. ADJUST ANGLE now to meet the bicyclist... 
He's African-American. Anywhere from 33 to 40. Wears wire-rim glasses, a fresh white oxford shirt, creased slacks and a solid green tie. An unobtrusive figure, at once familiar and yet undiscerning. The type you'd pass on a sidewalk and never even notice. He's TREVOR GARFIELD. 
ADJUST ANGLE FURTHER now to reveal the upper promenade bike path and a dramatic view of Lower Manhattan behind him. Morning sun glimmers off the Trade Center towers. 
Trevor's shadow skitters along the wooden path, 160 ft. above the East River. 
A fat briefcase, strapped to the back of his bike, rocks back and forth as he pumps the pedals. 
FROM ABOVE now a sweeping view of Trevor, alone on the bike path, a speck, suspended above a sea of rush hour traffic on the bridge below. 
2   EXT. ATLANTIC AVENUE (BEDFORD STUYVESANT) - MORNING         2 
A wrought-iron train trestle covered with graffiti shakes as an "EL" TRAIN ROARS overhead. Trevor races parallel with it along Atlantic Avenue. Every city block becomes more and more rundown. 
3   EXT. ROOSEVELT WHITNEY HIGH SCHOOL (BEDFORD                 3 STUYVESANT) - MORNING 
A cyclone fence frames the stalwart face of the old three-story administration building. Ubiquitous gray patches of paint fail to cover where taggers have most recently left their marks. The ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL, a black man with a booming voice, barks at late-comers who are about to be tardy... 
ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL (clapping his hands) ... Let's go, people! Tardy lock- out starts in one minute! Get your butts in gear! One minute, people! Move it!

SUPERIMPOSE:    ROOSEVELT WHITNEY HIGH SCHOOL - OCTOBER 1994 
The Assistant Principal, attention diverted, doesn't even notice Trevor as he enters on his bike and races down the sidewalk in front of the school. With all the prompting, students still don't seem to be in much of a hurry. 
4    OMITTED                                                         4 
5    INT. RWHS "A" BUILDING - MAIN ENTRANCE                          5 
... as Trevor squeezes through the doorway past students being processed through card readers and metal detectors and turns down the main hall. 
6    INT. RWHS - MAIN FLOOR                                          6 
With a glance over his shoulder, Trevor hops back onto his bike and pedals it down the middle of the corridor. STRAGGLING STUDENTS either ignore him or look at him like he's insane. 
STRAGGLING STUDENT (as Trevor passes) ... No ridin' bikes in 'a hallway, stoo-pit. 
6A   INT. STAIRWELL                                                  6A 
As Trevor reaches the end of the main corridor... and steers his bike down the stairs. 
7    INT. RWHS - BOTTOM FLOOR                                        7 
Trevor coasts skillfully down the stairs and emerges onto the bottom floor of the school. He pedals away toward the other end of the corridor. 
7A   EXT. TREVOR'S CLASSROOM                                         7A 
A crowd of 10th graders loiter outside Trevor's room. Seeing him coming, they stir to life with a flurry of taunts. Trevor chooses to face all dissension with a smile.

7A   CONTINUED:                                                  7A 
As Trevor hops off his bike and unlocks the classroom door, he notices two lovers making out in the hallway... 
VOICE IN CROWD ... Yuh late, Garfield. 
TREVOR (catching his breath) ... No, bell hasn't rung yet. Okay, let's get inside. C'mon. (as they file into the room) ... Morning, morning. Rise and shine. 
TWO STUDENTS make passing comments... 
AUGGIE (shaking his head) ... You one crazy-ass nigga, G. 
TYWAN (a quarter stuck in one ear) ... Damn skippy. 
TREVOR Thank you for sharing, Auggie. 
TYWAN (provoking Auggie) ... Auggie doggie. 
AUGGIE (O.S.) Fuck you, Tywan. Yer mama's a gangsta-rapper. 
Trevor offers a pleasant greeting to the two lovers. 
TREVOR 'Scuse me, you two... this isn't the Playboy Channel. 
Trevor enters the room, but ducks his head back into the hall. 
A PUERTO RICAN WOMAN prods a group of gangbanger wanna- bes. Two of the teens hover over a Sony Walkman, sharing the earphones. 
SECRETARY Okay, fellas, off the table. Put the Walkman away. I said put it away... 
A 10th grade counselor's office opens and a student emerges. Trevor walks directly in. 
TREVOR Walter, I need to speak with you. 
WALTER (Anglo; 52) is a disheveled middle-aged counselor. A lifer. He chews on an empty smoking pipe as he glances through a student "cum" (cue-mm). 
WALTER (preoccupied) I'm pretty busy right now, Garfield. What is it? 
Trevor sets the book down on Walter's desk and nervously adjusts his glasses. 
TREVOR Could you open it, please? 
Walter opens the book. 
WALTER (a weary look of disgust) Don't suppose this kid cares about our budget crisis? (shuts the book) Have the textbook room charge him for the book. 
Walter snaps the book shut and looks up at Trevor. That's all? 
TREVOR One-Eight-Seven is a penal code number for murder, Walter. Means the same thing as T-O-S. 'Terminate On the Spot.' 
(CONTINUED) 
11   CONTINUED:                                                     11 
WALTER (piqued) For chrissake, I know what it stands for. Look, kid probably heard it in a rap song. Doesn't mean anything. 
TREVOR ... The book belongs to Dennis Broadway. He's a known gangster, Walter -- a 'Five Percenter.' 
WALTER Garfield, if I had a dollar for every time a student threatened faculty... Don't you think you're overreacting a little? 
TREVOR (suppressing trepidation) Did you tell Dennis Broadway he was getting a fail from me? 
WALTER (stymied) I have legal access to those files. 
TREVOR He's a transfer from Nixon High School, isn't he? 
WALTER (becoming defensive) Look, I'm not obligated to track you down every time a transfer student comes through here. You want confidential information like that, come look it up in his cum (cue-mm). 
Trevor exhales a sigh of resignation. 
TREVOR Do you have him on a contract? 
WALTER If he gets through the semester without a fail then he gets to go back to Nixon, so what? 
TREVOR ... and be with his homeboys. 
(CONTINUED) 
11   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             11 
Walter's caught between a rock and a hard place.   His instincts lean toward self-preservation. 
WALTER So he blew his opportunity. Now he has to learn to live with the consequences. 
TREVOR I don't think this kid's ready to deal with the consequences. I think he wants me dead. 
WALTER Relax, has nothin' to do with you. 
TREVOR I should have been told, Walter. 
WALTER Hey, I'm on your side, Garfield, but my hands are tied. Kid has a right to his privacy... Know what your problem is? You're an idealist. 
TREVOR What's wrong with that? 
WALTER You only see what you wanna see, that's what's wrong. On one hand you think someone's trying to kill you. On the other hand you actually believe kids are paying attention in your classes. 
Trevor resigns himself to the fact that he's come to the wrong person for support. 
TREVOR (collecting himself) Never mind. It's not a problem. 
WALTER (an empty promise) Tell you what, as soon as I get a chance I'll summons the kid. Promise. 
Trevor's bemusement holds us. 
1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                              10. 
12   INT. RWHS "A" BUILDING - MAIN CORRIDOR - MORNING            12 
Trevor retraces his steps back up the empty corridor as the passing BELL RINGS. Within seconds the corridor is teeming with teenagers. 
Into SLOW MOTION now. MANEUVERING THROUGH the crowd to DISCOVER DENNIS BROADWAY (16). About ten paces behind. His Snoop-Dogg Afro frames a gold earring and a pair of deep-set eyes filled with vitriol. Oblivious of Dennis, Trevor presses on toward the north stairwell. 
VARIOUS SHOTS OVERHEAD and THROUGH crowd as the gap between Dennis and Trevor narrows. Every facial expression, every blink of an eye, all magnified a hundred times. 
Broadway's right hand is wrapped in a dirty white handkerchief as he reaches into the front pocket of his baggie Solos and pulls out a block of wood with a ten-penny nail imbedded in it. 
13   INT. RWHS - AT NORTH STAIRWELL                              13 
Trevor's heavy eyelids blink as he slowly glances up into a parabolic mirror on the wall. A silent, paroxysmal terror registers on his face. 
In a parabolic mirror, the blurred image of Dennis Broadway, pushing hard toward a conclusion now. 
BACK TO SPEED as Dennis explodes forward, body blocking Trevor from behind, pinning him against a wall and sending the "187" textbook flying. 
He rams his weapon into Trevor's back. 
21   CONTINUED:                                                        21 
TEACHER #1 (pointing) All the way out, next to the parking lot. Last bungalow on the left. 
TREVOR ... Thank you. 
TEACHER #1 (fatalistic) Good luck. 
Her comment weighs on him as he resumes his winding path through the bustle of students headed for first period. 
22   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - MAIN CORRIDOR/CLASSROOMS -               22 TREVOR'S POV 
Glancing through open doorways. Observing the inner life of various classrooms in passing... sees students watch- ing TV, teacher ignores them. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
23   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - CLASSROOM #2                             23 
ANGLO MALE, 39, slouching behind his desk, attempting to read a newspaper but distracted by an offstage commotion. 
CLASSROOM #2 TEACHER (ANGLO MALE) (erupting) ... Sit down. I come back there and you're gonna be sorry. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
24   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - CLASSROOM #3/COMPUTER LAB                24 
On the opposite side of the corridor... we can hear Ellen Henry's voice before reaching her doorway. All brightness and light, full of enthusiasm... 
ELLEN (O.S.) (like,    a buzzer; times    up) ... EEEEgghh!     Wrong. William, you know this.     C'mon, how do you find the pound    sign? What's the fastest way? 
(CONTINUED) 
24   CONTINUED:                                                   24 
Now we see her through the doorway. ELLEN HENRY (TEACHER #3). She's thirty, Anglo, and non-tenured. At the front of the class ten students stand linked together, arm-in- arm, in a human chain. WILLIAM (15) sits behind a computer in the front row struggling to decipher the problem... 
ELLEN (playfully) You're not thinking. (a major clue) How 'bout Binary search. 
William remains puzzled. The chain of students delight in chiding him. "C'mon, Beavis!"... 
ELLEN (the answer) You split them! 
Ellen attempts to bisect the impulsive chain of students with a double-handed karate chop. Fickle chain that they are, they resist. 
ELLEN (amused) ... Very funny. 
Now a SLOW MOTION fleeting moment as she catches Trevor's passing gaze and openly smiles at him. 
25   INT. MEN'S BATHROOM                                          25 
Trevor rinses his face at the sink as Victor Sifuentes' head speaks to him from above one of the heavily graffitied stalls in b.g. 
VICTOR So who yuh here for? 
TREVOR Eskander. 
VICTOR (zipping up, exiting) Aw, man, you got bungalow duty. 
26   EXT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - BUNGALOWS - MORNING                 26 
On a MEANDERING COURSE, MERGING with Trevor now. 
(CONTINUED) 
26   CONTINUED:                                                       26 
Increasing evidence of tagging, and bands of wandering students, indicate a higher degree of disorder the further one gets from the Main Office. 
FROM ABOVE NOW, like Algernon and his maze, Trevor negotiates his own path deeper and deeper into the configuration of bungalows. 
... And Trevor's trepidation. Eyes discerning every passerby. His PULSE AUDIBLY RACES, senses heightened. 
SHIFTING INTO SLOW MOTION AGAIN... And the reverberating SOUND of a SPRAY PAINT MARBLE as Trevor rounds a corner and comes face to face with three tag-bangers concealing spray paint cans inside their oversized jackets. One of the taggers locks eyes with Trevor as he passes, a slow premonitory burn. The tagger has a "skin tight" (pelon) hair cut and a string of black rosary beads around his neck. A barcode tattoo on the back of his neck identi- fies BENNY. 
27   EXT. UTILITY SHED AND VICINITY - MORNING                         27 
... Behind the bungalows, adjacent the delivery gate. Meet DAVE CHILDRESS, a forty-something ditto-head. The residual effects of a hangover linger as he sneaks a cigarette before first period. He wears a faded Hawaiian shirt and Huarache sandals. An old military tattoo emblazons his left forearm. As he crushes out his cigarette, something catches his eye. 
28   EXT. UTILITY SHED                                                28 
... Thru a chain-link fence we see a handful of cholo- types loitering around the shed. 
Childress investigates.    As he approaches the fence... 
CHILDRESS ... Hey, ese(s)?! 
Homeboys scatter in all directions, some hop the chain- link fence, others scurry out a narrow gate behind the shed. Childress weighs an amused smirk. Now out of nowhere a gangbanger lurches from the shed, buttoning his sagging Dickies and tripping over his own feet. He scrambles out the back gate and is gone. 
Childress, curiosity piqued, now enters the compound through a tear in the fence.

29   INT. UTILITY SHED - MOMENTS LATER                              29 
As Childress pokes his head inside he discovers... 
Rita Nartinez, seventeen... braless. A niobium belly- ring piercing her navel. She pulls a dark blue sweat shirt on over her head. Glances up at Childress. Masks her shame with a defiant smirk. 
(Behind the heavy eyeliner and baggy pants of a chola, Rita's really nothing more than a little lost girl.) 
As they shake right in front of Childress' face he can't help noticing the mean scar on the back of Trevor's hand. 
CHILDRESS Nice scar yuh got there. 
There's something familiar about this sub. 
CHILDRESS Ever sub here before? 
TREVOR First time. 
CHILDRESS (curiously) What about permanent? 
TREVOR I taught seven years in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. Roosevelt Whitney High School. 
(CONTINUED) 
35   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                35 
CHILDRESS Roosevelt Whitney? Didn't some teacher get stabbed to death there last year? 
TREVOR Actually, he survived. 
CHILDRESS No, it was on 'Sixty Minutes.' Some gangbanger stabbed this guy with a ten-penny nail like a dozen times in a hallway and... 
Childress looks from Trevor silently stirring his soup down to the scar again... and now it hits him. 
CHILDRESS Jesus Christ, you're him.   It was you. 
Ellen blanches. 
CHILDRESS (awestruck) Holy shit, Garfield. When was that? December before last? No, it was fall. 
TREVOR October 27. 
CHILDRESS Whadda schmuck. I'm sittin' here givin' advice to a man with a purple heart. 
ELLEN Excuse me... 
Inexplicably, she gets up and leaves. As Trevor watches Ellen go, Childress slides closer to him. 
CHILDRESS (sotto) Lemme tell yuh somethin'. In my book you're a fuckin' hero. Damn straight. 
Trevor slides a look back to Dave as he eats his soup. 
TREVOR ... Getting stabbed doesn't make me a hero. 
(CONTINUED) 
35   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                35 
CHILDRESS (disregards Trevor's comment) So what'd they give the kid? 
TREVOR They put 'im upstate in a facility until his twenty-first birthday. 
CHILDRESS That all? They shoulda caned the bastard. Like they did that kid in Singapore. Remember? (recollecting) President of Singapore had a few choice words. Use to have it memorized... He said something like, 'When a state of increasing disorder and defiance cannot be checked by the rules... then new and sometimes drastic rules have to be forged to maintain order.' (slides Trevor a glance) 'The alternative is to surrender order to chaos and anarchy.' 
TREVOR So why do you still teach? 
CHILDRESS Same reason as you, Garfield -- for the paycheck. 
36   EXT. BUNGALOW #86 - AFTERNOON (SIXTH PERIOD; NEXT DAY)           36 
The windows and blinds are shut now. 
37   INT. BUNGALOW #86 - CLOCK ON WALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION            37 
is inching toward the top of the hour. 
Closing their books and loading their knapsacks, the students talk and pay more attention to the inexorable march of time than to Trevor writing on an overhead projector. 
TREVOR Okay, someone tell me the difference between the central nervous system and the lymphatic system? 
(CONTINUED)

Rita Nartinez (the chola from the "utility" shed) sits near the front of the class. She wears her usual heavy eyeliner and a new nose ring. 
RITA (obscenely) Mr. G, you gotta nice butt. 
Class erupts. Rita enjoys the attention.        Trevor turns and looks at her squarely. 
TREVOR You seem to be an expert on anatomy, Miss -- (checks roster) -- Nartinez. Central nervous system and lymphatic system. What's the difference? 
RITA ... Uh... 
Trevor doesn't expect anything remotely close to the right answer. 
RITA It's like the central nervous system, that's your brain and spinal cord, and the lymphatic system, that's the stuff in your blood that fights diseases. 
A beat.   Trevor looks up at her. 
TREVOR Very good. 
Trevor notices Cesar Sanchez writing on his desk.      Stevie cranes his neck to observe. Paco snoozes. 
TREVOR Cesar. 
ON bug zapper above garage, a churning, SLOW MOTION swarm of bugs repeatedly throw themselves headlong into the light. 
46   INT. TREVOR'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION                   46 
MUSIC plays faintly on the STEREO. Numerous artifacts occupy the bookshelves. A primitive AFRICAN MASAI BOW (with two arrows) is mounted on a wall.

Trevor, tie loosened. Ellen, in nylon stocking feet, leaning back against a couch. On the coffee table before them are dirty dishes and half-full wine glasses. Trevor's lost in a thin introspective smile. 
ELLEN (breaks the silence) ... So you have a wife hiding in a closet somewhere? 
TREVOR (smile widens) No.   No wife. 
ELLEN Don't you ever get lonely? 
Trevor considers the question. 
TREVOR (genuinely) Sometimes. There's this passage in God's Lonely Man by Thomas Wolfe where he says, '... The whole conviction of my life rests upon the belief that loneliness is the central and inevitable fact of human existence.' I believe that. 
ELLEN God that's depressing. 
They both laugh. 
TREVOR ... My New York mentality. (beat) It's not always easy looking on the bright side. 
ELLEN Especially after spending a year in and out of a hospital, I would guess. 
A beat. 
TREVOR Actually, that wasn't the toughest part -- it's the robbery that's been hardest to recover from. 
ELLEN (didn't know about this) What'd they steal? (CONTINUED)

TREVOR My passion. My old, unguarded self. I resent that. I want them back. 
He offers a smile.        Ellen returns it. 
ELLEN They're still there. Everybody around me seems to have given up. They're all so beaten down. But you're different. You refuse to be beaten. 
TREVOR So do you. 
Kindred souls.      Ellen fills her glass. 
ELLEN Remember the last time a student surprised you? 
TREVOR You mean where a light goes on? 
ELLEN Yeah. Where the kid surpasses all your expectations. 
TREVOR ... Been awhile. So few you can actually get through to... You? 
ELLEN (thinks) ... That would have to be Daniel Terrazas. This was last year sometime. Kid was failing miserably ... But he was the best Salsa dancer in the whole school. 
TREVOR (brightens slightly) Uh-oh. 
ELLEN So I made 'im a deal. Tutoring in exchange for Salsa lessons. 
TREVOR Saw it... Jerry Springer. 
(CONTINUED)

ELLEN No, no. He was a perfect gentleman. 
TREVOR (dryly) Male teachers can't do things like that. They get arrested. 
ELLEN Yep, double standard... By the way, did you know Cesar Sanchez was Special Ed? (as Trevor shakes his head) Yep, he never should've been mainstreamed. His I.E.P. says he's L.H. but he acts more like S.E.D. 
TREVOR Severely Emotionally Disturbed... that's great. 
A beat. Then Ellen gets up, wine glass balanced in her left hand. 
ELLEN Come on, Garfield -- on your feet. Lemme teach you how to Salsa. 
TREVOR (resisting) No, no, I'm no good at that. 
Ellen spins the tuner on the STEREO to a LATIN STATION and practically yanks Trevor to his feet. 
ELLEN Let's go.   Don't play shy with me, homeboy. 
Trevor grimaces, awkwardly relinquishes, as Ellen walks him through it. 
ELLEN (still holding wine glass) That's it... Okay, follow me. It starts on the one. Step forward with your left foot... One. Change weight on, two. (MORE)

Trevor eyes them, finds what he was looking for in the book... 
TREVOR (addressing class) Since some of you seem to have an interest in anesthetics, I've prepared a little demonstration. 
Glances over at Rita now.    Checks the wall clock. 
TREVOR Rita, bring your friend in the cage over here, please. 
Bringing the cage over... 
RITA His name's Snowball. Like 'dat lil' pig dude from Animal Farm. 
TREVOR (coolly impressed) You've read Animal Farm? 
CESAR (above the din) ... schoolgirl. 
RITA (snapping a look) Shut up, Cesar. 
TREVOR You read Animal Farm, Cesar? 
CESAR No, but I fucked a sheep. 
Stevie and Paco love it. 
TREVOR Cesar, come up here. (gesturing) I want you to have a front row seat for this. 
Surprisingly, Cesar does what he's told as Trevor removes an old pocket watch from his briefcase and sets it next to Snowball's cage...

TREVOR And remove the 'lokes.' 
Cesar removes his dark glasses.       His eyes are bloodshot and vapid. 
TREVOR Why your eyes so red? 
CESAR (lying) Mus' be pink-eye, sir. 
CESAR (eyes Trevor's pocket watch) Nice watch, homes. Can I have it? 
Disregarding Cesar, Trevor opens a drawer and removes two latex surgical gloves from a cardboard box. He puts on the gloves and selects a petri dish from another drawer. 
TREVOR (pointing) Rita, would you bring me a sugar cube from the shelf over there? 
She does. Trevor now removes a small amber bottle (with an eye-dropper top) from his briefcase. The class starts to settle down now as Trevor pre-measures water in a pipette and adds it to the petri dish. 
TREVOR (referring to text) Cesar, read Young's rule for us. Page 564. At the top. 
CESAR (like it's above him) I ain't gonna read 'dat shit. 
TREVOR Rita, give Cesar your book.    Let 'im read. 
Rita places her book on Cesar's desk. 
CESAR Forget it. 
Jeers from the class, "Come on, read".       "Hurry up, Cesar."

TREVOR (prompting him) 'Young's rule...' Go on. 
Rita points to the passage in the book.        Cesar slaps her hand. 
RITA (reacting) ... Chunt. (Choont.) 
CESAR Stoopit bitch. 
TREVOR Touch her again, Cesar, and you'll answer to me personally. 
Rita knits her eyebrows at Trevor.        Cesar laughs. 
CESAR You like her, Mr. G? 
Class erupts. 
RITA (shrinking) Shut up! 
TREVOR (genuinely) Settle down, everyone. We all have to learn how to forgive and get along. C'mon, Cesar, read. Please. 
At first Cesar doesn't budge.         Now grudgingly he looks down at the book... 
CESAR (attempting to read) ... Young's rule... ff... fo... 
TREVOR ... Formulates. 
Cesar heaves the book across the room: Class erupts, "Refer 'im," "Send 'im tuh Hyland." Trevor walks over and picks up the book. Class now settles. Watches Trevor closely to see what he's going to do. Trevor gazes at Cesar...

TREVOR ... I say everyone deserves another chance. Whadda you say, Cesar? 
The mini-truck follows her in reverse. Rita halts and begins ranting at the cholo, waving her arms all around. Now she stomps away and the mini-truck drives away with a lurch. 
ELLEN (V.O.) ... Only problem is I hate to leave Jack with my mother for any extended period of time. I'm afraid she'll forget to feed him and he'll starve to death.

TREVOR If you want, I'll take care of Jack. 
ELLEN I can't ask you to do that. 
TREVOR (straight at Ellen now) Sure you can. 
66   INT. BUNGALOW #86 - AFTERNOON (NEXT DAY; FIFTH PERIOD)         66 
Trevor's conference period. He stands atop a ladder in the front of the room, drilling holes in the wall for a jerry-rigged camera mount. As he climbs down, Rita enters. Paces back and forth, wringing a clenched spiral notebook, English Comp. essay tucked inside... 
TREVOR (continues working) ... Aren't you supposed to be at P.E. fifth period? 
RITA (rants; kicks a desk) ... Sunland Boyz gettin' crazy, ol lady's... fucked up. Fuck dis being down shit. I wanna do somethin' wit' my life. 
A POLAROID PHOTO drops out of her notebook.     Trevor reaches down and scoops it up. 
INSERT - POLAROID PHOTO/DEAD GANG MEMBER IN CASKET 
Puppet... a young 16-year-old cholo, dressed in gang colors, laid out in an open casket. 
ON TREVOR 
Now as he hands the photo back to Rita. 
TREVOR ... You know this guy? 
Rita takes the photo back.    She doesn't want to talk about it. 
RITA (unravels now; begins to cry) 'Gotta make J-C next year. 'Got to! I ain't never gonna get up outta here. 
TREVOR Rita, slow down. 
RITA 'Dat bitch Quinn, I'm 'onna sue her ass. 'Swear tuh God... 
TREVOR Okay, okay.   Calm down a second.

Rita collapses into a desk. 
TREVOR Who's Quinn?    What's she teach? 
RITA English Comp.    She's failin' me. 
Trevor tentatively picks up Rita's essay (branded with a big red "F") and begins reading it. 
RITA 'Bitch say I don't talk right. 
Trevor scrutinizes her with a glance.        Now back to Rita's essay. 
RITA She hates me.    She's racist against me. 
Trevor sets the essay down on Rita's desk.        Regards her with genuine candor... 
TREVOR Just cause you're a Latina doesn't mean everyone's racist against you. 
RITA (prideful) Hey, I'm a La Raza, prof-eh. 
TREVOR Okay... just stop blaming everyone else. You're too smart for that. (as Rita's rocked back) And every mistake in that essay is fixable, okay? So relax, it's not the end of the world. 
Rita collects herself, wipes the streaks of mascara running down her cheeks with her sleeve. Trevor studies her for a moment. 
TREVOR (points to counter) Tissues are in the first drawer. 
Rita pulls herself together and walks over to the island counter.

TREVOR (innocuously) How come you always wear so much makeup? 
RITA (wounded) ... To make me pretty. 
TREVOR (frankly) You don't need it. 
She grabs a handful of tissues, dabs at her smeared mascara. Now her hair falls forward, exposing the back of her neck... and a tattoo that reads "Puppet" in a scrawling signature. She tosses her hair back and it disappears. 
TREVOR (slightest bit probative) That your name? 
He indicates the back of her neck. 
RITA (with fervor and frustration) It's a gang thing. But I'm kickin' dat shit... Jus' cuz I look down for my neighborhood don't mean I'm stupit. 
TREVOR I know you're not. 
She inserts her "failed" essay inside the rolled-up spiral notebook. 
TREVOR (affected) No harm done... Don't cry now. 
Fully dressed again, remotely staring, Rita holds back tears. Trevor sits down on the couch next to her. Opens textbook. 
TREVOR Why don't you go ahead and copy the first rule there for the verb 'to be.' Can you do that for me? 
RITA (hiccups a sob) I jus' wan'ed to thank you. 
TREVOR You don't have to thank me, I'm your teacher. 
Rita opens her notebook and begins to copy the rule. She wipes at the tears with the sleeve of her baggy sweat shirt. Trevor resists the urge to comfort her. 
TREVOR ... From now on I think the best thing for us to do is meet in the library. 
72   INT. TREVOR'S BEDROOM - THAT EVENING (MAGIC HOUR)              72 
Trevor kneels at the foot of his bed. Fully dressed, shirt and loosened tie. Glimpses up at the crucifix on the wall. Bows his head again... 
TREVOR (prayerfully, to himself ... I'll try.

MOVING IN ON the MUTED sounds of an ARGUMENT (in Spanish). 
74   INT. APARTMENT 105 - CONTINUOUS ACTION                       74 
Dingy. Yellowing walls. Cesar and his mother continue their arguing as Cesar watches first the "Animaniacs" and switches channels to "The Deer Hunter," while his BABY SISTER CRIES in her high chair. 
MRS. SANCHEZ is older looking than her thirty-four years. Clutching her purse... 
MRS. SANCHEZ                                          * (on the verge              (subtitles... You stay of tears)                 out of my ... Deja mis cosas, Cesar.     things, Cesar. You hear Me oyes? Ese dinero es         me? That money puts para poner comida en el        food on your baby plato de tu hermanita.         sister's plate. 
Cesar yells at his SISTER to stop CRYING... 
CESAR                     (subtitlesshut up, Callate el osico, Rosillo!     Rosillo! (now to his mother) Que? Me estas mandando?        You tellin' me what to Yo soy el hombre de esta       do?! I'm the man in casa! Enceneme respeto!        this house! you show me respect!)

In a rage, Cesar digs into his pocket and throws twenty dollars in his mother's face. She cowers. 
CESAR                  (subtitlesHere, I don't Tenga, no nesecito su          need your pinche, apestoso dinero!       stinkin' money!) 
They're interrupted by a KNOCK at the front door. 
CESAR (indicating door) I ain't getting it. You get it.

Cesar plops down on an old worn out recliner and goes back to watching "Animaniacs" on the TELEVISION. ROSILLO STOPS her CRYING and Mrs. Sanchez carefully gathers the money scattered at her feet. 
75   INT. APARTMENT 105 - FRONT DOOR                                    75 
Behind the screen door, a silhouette fills the doorway. 
MOVING IN ON CESAR. 
He can faintly hear the O.S. conversation as he watches TV. 
MRS. SANCHEZ                                                * (O.S.)                    (subtitlesYes, who's Si, quien es?                     there?)

76   INT. APARTMENT #105 - CESAR'S POV - TREVOR AND MRS.                76 SANCHEZ 
PIVOTING now to see Trevor enter the front door. 
Cesar glares with flint-hard eyes at Trevor. 
TREVOR Hello, Cesar. 
Breaking his unrelenting stare, Cesar now squeezes past Trevor and out the screen door, slamming it behind him. 
1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                                   69. 
TREVOR He didn't do anything.    He's a good kid. 
81   EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD - MORNING (NUTRITION PERIOD)                81 
ESTABLISHING the different student factions. 
MUSIC, playing over a PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM, fills the quad. 
Trevor, now an interloper, crossing the senior lawn, openly searching for Cesar. 
Tag-bangers, a clique of eight or nine K.O.S. wanna-be(s). Feature PACO (16) as they take quick hits off a blunt. 
Now Cesar extinguishes the blunt with his fingertips and hides it as Trevor wanders into their midst. 
TREVOR (glances around; sniffs) Been smokin' the chronic, Cesar? 
CESAR (a smirk) I'm hooked on phonics... not 'hooked on chronic.' 
Laughs all around. 
TREVOR (not amused) You wouldn't happen t'know who vandalized bungalow eighty-six last night? 
CESAR (feigning ignorance) You guys know anything about that? (off silence) Sorry, maestro... nada. 
(CONTINUED) 
81   CONTINUED:                                                     81 
TREVOR (sotto) Garcia may not think there's enough here to prove anything. But you and I both know who's responsible. Don't we? 
CESAR Whadda you, a narc? Seriously, I don't know what the fuck you're talkin' about. 
Trevor maintains his fervent demeanor. Now he notices the ring on Cesar's right index finger. 
INSERT - CESAR'S RING 
emblazoned with a green marijuana leaf. 
TREVOR (pointing) The ring, Cesar... lemme have it. 
Cesar dramatically jerks back his finger. 
CESAR Watch it, eh... that's my trigger finger. 
As Cesar, with purpose, aims an invisible gun at Trevor... 
TREVOR It's inappropriate attire... 
CESAR ... Bang. 
TREVOR (momentous deliberation) ... Are you finished? 
Cesar starts to laugh.    A crowd begins to gather. 
CESAR What? Finished with what?   Don't get crazy on me, dude. 
The boisterous crowd escalates... hoots and hollers. 
After weighing the situation, Trevor exchanges palpable looks with Cesar.

Now he reluctantly back-pedals, squeezing his way past the wall of bodies pressed in behind him. 
His departure across an empty lawn is accompanied by a hail of "boos" and taunts. 
82   EXT. BURBANK AIRPORT - LANDING RUNWAY - TWILIGHT                 82 
as an 737 ROARS down onto the tarmac. In the f.g., Trevor and Ellen PEEL away from the curb angrily.

ELLEN ... These conferences mainly focus on software now. 
TREVOR (far off) Software sells. 
ELLEN (flickers a smile) So, how's Jack? 
TREVOR ... Jack's good. 
As they pull up to a stop light... 
ELLEN (flirtatious) And what about Trevor?   Was Trevor a good boy, too? 
Triggers an unintended response... 
TREVOR (self-consciously) What's that supposed to mean? 
ELLEN (innocently) Nothing... 
(CONTINUED) 
TREVOR (offering pill) It's aspirin... 
ELLEN (refuses it) ... I can't talk to you right now, Trevor. Please. I'm so upset I can't even drive. I just need some time alone. 
Trevor acquiesces. Steps over to his desk and sets the glass of water down. A key protrudes from one of the desk drawers. He leans over, removes the key and plays with it for a moment.

TREVOR (beat) I know about what's not fair. I left part of my lung in a damn hospital because some gangbanger didn't like the grade I gave him. Sometimes you do all the right things. You work hard in school... get a good job... pay your taxes. Things still go bad. (eyes flicker) I'm so sorry, Ellen. 
Ellen shuts her heavy eyelids now.    Shuts out the world. 
94   EXT. ALLEY BEHIND TREVOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT                      94 
A thorough investigation now at the foot of Jack's wall... 
... Trevor's flashlight fixes on a faint set of shoe prints in the dirt. 
Waffle-soled Doc Martens.    He follows their trail, down the alley. 
Hesitating at the wall again. He now focuses his flashlight beam on a smattering of graffiti... and discovers a fresh tag... 
In black spray paint, the letters K.O.S. Trevor reaches out and touches a coagulated trickle of paint. As he inspects the faint residue on his fingertip... 
95   OMITTED                                                       95

About 2 a.m.    The street's empty. 
Cesar's darkened apartment is tucked away in the distance. Now a lone figure emerges and beats a path through the projects... CLOSER now... it's Cesar. White T-shirt, sagging gray dickies... 
FOLLOWING HIM now... as he crosses the edge of a dirt lot. FOCUSING ON his Doc Marten boots and their waffle- soled print...

97   EXT. FREEWAY UNDERPASS - NIGHT                               97 
Merging with Cesar as he slinks down the dark alley corridor. Lighting a blunt off his Zippo lighter... 
98   FURTHER DOWN                                                 98 
Cesar spray paints a wall with a can of black enamel paint. He takes another hit. Chokes down a shit-eating grin. And admires his work... a goofy dog smoking a blunt. 
... below the dog he scrawls the word, "CARTOON." Above it, "K.O.S. As he slips the spray can into his front pocket, he senses a presence.. 
CESAR ... 'At you, Stevie? 
Profound silence. Grin dissolves. Riveted, Cesar takes another slow hit off his blunt. Suddenly a coyote darts past him. 
CESAR (startled) ... Hells, man. Stupit dog. 
His sick smirk returns. But only momentarily. Now a premonitory flicker registers on his face. He blinks as a Masai arrow splits the darkness and pierces his left pectoral muscle. 
Exhaling a stunned breath, Cesar looks down at the arrow. An incredulous, stupefied laugh escapes him as he pulls the arrow out of his chest and studies it... 
The normal length of the arrow's been shortened by half and the tip has been fitted with a modified hypodermic needle. (The needle extends from a rubber stopper which has retracted into the hypodermic casing, causing the solution in the hypo to jettison through the needle and into Cesar). 
CESAR ... Mutha fuck. 
Now back-pedaling, stumbling, dropping the arrow, he turns and runs off. 
99   EXT. FREEWAY UNDERPASS                                       99 
Cesar collapses onto a pile of garbage bags. MOVING IN. His eyes fixed and dilated. Forehead beaded with perspiration. Fighting against the effects of the injection... 
Now blackness...

She glances about, momentarily disoriented.      Now she remembers where she is and what happened. 
ELLEN Trevor? 
No response.    Choking back emotions.

As Ellen returns. She notices the glass of water on the desk. Bravely collects herself. Crosses over to the desk and sits down. 
ELLEN ... Where'd you put the aspirin? 
Like an involuntary reflex she tugs on the center drawer of the desk, but it's locked. Now she pulls on one of the side drawers and it slides open. Ellen stops at what she sees... 
... a treasure-trove of homemade shivs, Bic lighters, Walkmen, pagers... and Benny Chacon's black rosary beads. 
Rain lashes the faculty parking lot...

HIP-HOP TRACK FADES now replaced by the buzz of cross-talk. Trevor strolls the aisles, an open science book in hand. 
(NOTE: Rita is dressed in overalls, very subdued compared to her usual attire.) 
Cesar's back... and seated in his regular seat, across from Stevie Littleton. Uncharacteristically, his eyes are fixed on the book in front of him. 
TREVOR (addressing class) ... Name one of four parts that make up the human hand? 
Trevor holds up his hand for display. 
TREVOR ... Hands, please. 
A reluctant cross section of hands go up.

6th period is by no means a synchronized whole but there has developed an odd sort of order to its madness. 
Trevor looks around.      Picks on an Anglo girl in the second row. 
TREVOR Christian. 
CHRISTIAN ... The metacarpals. 
TREVOR The Metacarpals. That's one. (to class) Name some more? 
Now he picks on Rita... 
TREVOR Rita. 
RITA The wrist... and thumb. 
A flurry of thumbs go up as if on cue. 
TREVOR Good. (holding up all his fingers now) ... And don't forget the phalanges. 
Fingers shoot up and wiggle on cue... 
CLASS (in unison) Phalanges, phalanges, phalanges... 
Scattered laughter and groans at this embarrassing routine... 
Cesar's beaten gaze remains riveted to his book. Now he slides a look at the "R-U-DUN" tatt on his right index finger. The severed finger has been sewn back on, supported by a finger brace. 
Stevie openly stares at the back of Trevor's head as Trevor passes by in the aisle.

Ellen sits behind her computer, lost in a grading program... 
Trevor now enters.    Damp hair and shoulders. 
TREVOR May I come in? 
Ellen stops what she's working on. 
ELLEN (reticently) Hi. 
TREVOR (concerned) Where'd you go the other night? 
ELLEN I was going to ask you the same thing. 
TREVOR ... I went for a run. (changes subject) Wanna get some Chinese later? There's a new place in the Valley Center. 'Spose to be pretty good. 
ELLEN (an excuse) ... Can't tonight. Maybe another time. 
Weighs it, and... 
TREVOR (stands there for a moment) ... I should probably correct papers anyway. Some of these bungalow kids actually care about a grade. Even Cesar's doing better. Today, for the first time since I took over for Eskander, he actually did his work. (beat) Today Cesar Sanchez was a success. Maybe for the first time in his life. (blinks now) You alright?

Her own poker face now... 
ELLEN Whoever sent that message isn't as anonymous as they think. 
Ellen turns to her console, clicks the REPLY button.    A new mail message window opens up. It's addressed to the anonymous sender, STUDENT #00. Ellen types in: 
GO TO THE OFFICE 
All the while anticipation builds on Stevie's face.    He glances around, starting to get nervous. 
Ellen now clicks the SEND button... 
Stevie's COMPUTER BEEPS...    COMPUTER VOICE:   "You've got mail..." 
... A window opens in the middle of Stevie's monitor revealing Ellen's return message. 
Class erupts and Stevie springs out of his seat... 
STEVIE 'Dat's bullshit, man! 
He rushes up to the front of the class. 
STEVIE You best step off, Ms. H. Cuz you can't prove nuthin'. And I know you can't afford to lose 'dis minimum wage job 'a yers. 
ELLEN (beat and) You're right, Stevie. I can't afford to live in a big house south of the boulevard. Like you do. 
Class erupts again, coming down on Stevie and his wanna-be poor boy from the streets image. They're laughing at him now, not with him. In a rage, Stevie kicks open the hallway door and exits the classroom. 
115   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS MAIN OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER             115 
Ellen hastily enters, looking for Stevie. Addresses IRIS (a thirty-something Hispanic woman) behind the counter...

ELLEN Iris, did Steven Littleton come in here? 
IRIS Haven't seen 'im. 
Teacher #1, the insipid woman, checks her mail slot.    It's her conference period. 
TEACHER #1 (appalled) You're not supposed to leave your classroom unattended. 
ELLEN (reacting) Sue me. 
Teacher #1 exits in a flurry. Ellen now glances to her right. Seated there in rigid silence is BENNY CHACON'S MOTHER (51). 
IRIS (offers; sotto) Benny Chacon's mother. Told 'er Garcia had to leave early today but she jus' sits there. She been saying some pretty crazy things. 
Mrs. Chacon begins speaking Spanish in plaintive spurts. Ellen can't decipher what she is saying... 
ELLEN (to Mrs. Chacon) ... Espanol, muy poquito, senora. (beat) Mrs. Chacon... you have to slow down. (back to Iris) What's she saying? 
Hesitating.    Now with apprehension... 
IRIS You heard 'bout that body they foun' in the L.A. River... She says she thinks it's Benny. 
OFF Ellen's unblinking gaze... 
116   EXT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY CORONER'S OFFICE (DOWNTOWN) -          116 EVENING 
A concrete fortress... Ellen and Mrs. Chacon approach. 
117   OMITTED                                                        117 
118   INT. ASSISTANT CORONER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION            118 
Ellen and Mrs. Chacon sit stiffly in front of the ASSISTANT CORONER (mid-forties). Desk cluttered. Half- eaten sandwich in front of him. He nurses a Styrofoam cup of coffee as he flips through a John Doe folder. 
ASST. CORONER You say he's been missing approximately four weeks? 
ELLEN ... Four, almost five weeks. 
ASST. CORONER That's a long time. Lots a things happen to a body after four or five weeks. Makes it difficult to I.D. 
A faint, incongruous smile. 
ELLEN (indicating John Doe) So he just sits here? 
ASST. CORONER We keep 'um up to thirty days. Lady, we get 80, sometimes 90 Does a month. Floaters, gangbangers, illegals, junkies. Most of 'um cheap homicides. Nobody's even lookin' for 'em. (indicating folder) This guy here, has a dent in his head. Could be post-mortem trauma. Probably hit a retaining wall on his way down river after that rain we had. Who knows. (beat) Yuh ask me, this kid was dead before he got his head caved in. Overdose by morphine. That's what it looks like t'me. 
Ellen weighs it. Assistant Coroner now refers to some sort of questionnaire. 
ASST. CORONER On the phone you said the mother mentioned some identifying marks. 
Ellen refocuses a far-off, introspective gaze.

ELLEN Trevor... 
TREVOR (unravelling) I'm sorry but everyone can't always get what they want. Sometimes you gotta take responsibility for your actions. Have you ever been ready to die for a fundamental principle? They haven't. You think those punks would die protecting your Civil Rights? 
ELLEN Trevor, don't. 
TREVOR Did you know Cesar hits his mother? Steals money from her purse? Did you know that? 
Ellen blanches. 
TREVOR Did you know he was here that night? In the alley? 
ELLEN (confused) What are you talking about? 
TREVOR Cesar. Jack was provoked.     It wasn't an accident, Ellen.    Cesar killed him. 
Ellen just stares at him.       Traumatized... 
ELLEN (momentous deliberation) Where'd you get the rosary beads?

TREVOR (pause and...) I like you, Ellen. I like you so much. Do you believe that? 
ELLEN (riveted) Yes. 
Trevor can't find words. 
ELLEN ... I don't know you. 
With that, Ellen turns and walks out of the house as quickly as she came. 
TREVOR (plaintively) ... You do know me. I'm a teacher, just like you.

ESTABLISH hoardes of cowboy hats, belt sashes and boots as they dance to the loud Mexican band music on the patio... 
Non-Hispanics, along with non-Quebradita cliques, look on from the lawn area... 
DAVE CHILDRESS 
hanging back, on the fringes, scoping out the crowd. Notices a pack of cigarettes in the chest pocket of a 15-year-old kid standing next to him. Kid's wrapped up in talking to another kid, points to something O.S. 
CHILDRESS (to the kid with cigarettes) ... Don't you know it's not polite to point at people. Everytime you point a finger at someone else... (demonstrates) ... There's three fingers pointing back at you. (lesson over) Lemme have a cigarette.

... Cinco de Mayo. The sounds of a QUEBRADITA waft in from outside in the quad. 
At the same time, Steve follows him into the rest room. They're all alone. 
STEVIE Eh, Mr. G? 
Bracing himself with a fixed, straight-ahead look. 
STEVIE (boldly) I'm talkin' ta you, Garfield. (beat) Know what you did to Cesar. (wild notion) ... I'm thinkin' maybe you did Benny, too. (incredulously) That possible? You crush my friend's skull? Fuck 'im up wit' a two-by-four, maybe a baseball bat? 
No response.   As Trevor starts to leave, Stevie blocks his path. 
Trevor steps to one side to go around... but Stevie blocks his path again. 
TREVOR (trying to maintain) Please, step out of the way. 
STEVIE ... You kill my friend?   Huh? 
Trevor's head begins to swim. His life's falling apart. Like a trapped animal, he back-pedals a step to escape... but then suddenly snaps. 
He explodes into Stevie, crushing him against the bath- room wall. 
Trevor impales Stevie with a look that says it all. 
Stevie immediately shrinks. Trevor now blinks. Cooling himself down. Slowing his breathing. Stevie slips out from under his hold and bolts for the exit.

Cesar and his tag-bangers... Cesar holds court, drowned out by the MUSIC. Now Stevie arrives. Out of breath. Urgent to tell his story. 
Rita... Makeup subdued, wearing a cotton button-down blouse. She watches the Quebradita from behind a tree. A desire to be part of it, she moves a little closer... 
... as Cesar notices her. His head races from Stevie's news. Eyes penetrating. Now galvanized. On a rampage, he shoves his way through the crowd. 
Victor Sifuentes... on the opposite side of the patio, snapping a look, spotting Cesar moving in for the kill. With a start, Victor barks something into his walkie- talkie and squeezes his way into the Quebradita crowd... 
Cesar shoves Rita to the ground. 
CESAR School girl bitch!

STEVIE (ranting) You're a fuckin' murderer, Garfield! 
MR. GARCIA (calling for assistance) Victor? 
STEVIE ... Maybe I can't prove it but I know he did it. He fucked up Cesar and he killed Benny. (to crowd) Ast 'im! 
As Victor and another plainclothes cop attempt to remove Stevie... 
STEVIE Touch me and I'll sue yer ass! (as Victor backs off; now to Trevor) Yer dead, G! Yer a dead man! 
With that Stevie shoves Victor aside and bolts for the door. 
Garcia attempts to regain his composure... 
Trevor glances back to the spot where Ellen was standing... but now she's gone. 
126   EXT. FACULTY PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                     126

CHILDRESS Garfield, wait up... 
Trevor maintains a steady pace, one hopeful eye scouring the parking lot for Ellen... 
CHILDRESS ... Don't let that Littleton punk get to you. 
Trevor ignores him. 
CHILDRESS Lil' bastard's a tweaker. He's a speed freak. You didn't know that? 
At Trevor's car now.    Hesitating.    Turning to Childress... 
TREVOR (testing his patience) What is it, Dave? How can I help you? 
Unintentionally in Trevor's face... 
CHILDRESS How 'bout a ride? (taking a step back) ... The wife wouldn't let me drive my own car. Ain't that a bitch? 
Childress is pitiful. Wears a grease-stained tie with his wrinkled Hawaiian shirt and a Windbreaker. 
TREVOR (with resignation) ... You smell like beer. 
CHILDRESS I only had two. That's all. Swear ta Christ. 
Raising his palms. Surrendering.       Trevor studies him with a sad grimace. 
CHILDRESS I live right up here off Chandler. I'll buy you a drink.

At the end of a gravel driveway, behind a darkened house. Garage door open. 
Childress chain smokes and drinks beer as he leans against the dented fender of his '66 Lincoln Continental. Trevor nurses a Diet Coke... 
CHILDRESS ... I had the same situation 'round the time of that 'Night Stalker' thing. Remember that? Whole city was scared shitless. My wife was convinced the frickin' mailman was the 'Stalker' for about a week there. (a tubercular chuckle) Some mental giant in my 4th period starts this rumor, see. Childress is the 'Night Stalker.' Right? (chug-a-lugs) ... Idiots. Even after they caught that Ramirez jerk, I'd still hear those fucks '... They got the wrong guy. Childress is the Stalker, ese.' 
He finishes beer.    Crumples it. 
Trevor studies him, without expression. Now he notices something stapled to the tar paper wall... 
Trevor's POV of the "Certificate of Excellence in Teaching," yellowed and dogeared, hanging obliquely by one staple. 
... as Childress opens another beer. 
TREVOR (excusing himself) I better get goin'. Thanks for the soda. 
CHILDRESS Wait, wait. Hold your horses. Just hold on... 
... Finding a key in a drawer. 
CHILDRESS (a twisted grin) ... Can't leave without meetin' the kids. 
Childress unlocks a particle board cabinet against the garage wall. (CONTINUED)

A watery glint in his bloodshot eyes. Cabinet door swings wide now, revealing a mini arsenal of handguns... 
CHILDRESS Ta-dah... Huh? 
Trevor's eyes remain expressionless. 
Childress rhapsodizes as he removes and handles some of the guns... 
CHILDRESS ... This one's from Czechoslovakia. It's a C-Z .22 automatic. Ten round clip. Glow- in-the-dark sights. (eyeing the sights) Ain't that a beauty? (next) ... Then we gotta custom Smitty, 9 'milli.' With extended grip. These Smith & Wessons kick like a mutha. (and next) Now this one's special. A Glock 21. Lightest gun in the world. The barrel and firing pin are metal. See. Everything else on it's plastic. (handing it to Trevor) Here, feel that. 
Trevor takes it, reluctantly weighs it in the palm of his hand. Sets it down. 
Now Childress removes a gun from a holster in the small of his back, under his Windbreaker... 
130   CONTINUED:                                                      130 
In a flicker, we're transported back to Roosevelt Whitney... Dennis Broadway's image SLOWLY COMING TOWARD us down the long corridor... 
BACK TO SCENE 
Trevor catches his breath and blinks... 
... Back to reality.    The mirror is empty. 
He removes his Proventil inhaler from his shirt pocket. Suppressing gasps, he takes two hits. 
Two girls at the magazine racks whisper to each other, eyes firmly fixed on Trevor. 
Suddenly there's a presence at Trevor's side... 
LIBRARIAN ... I don't think she's coming. 
131   EXT. RITA'S TRAILER (SUN VALLEY) - SAME MORNING                 131 (7:30 AM) 
Strictly low rent district. The small dirt yard in front is contained within a cinder block wall. 
Rita, back to her chola look, heavy makeup, black (right) eye where Cesar punched her, watches her two younger brothers as they fight over a toy truck. Her three-year-old baby sister, Maricella (too big to be carried) straddles her hip as Rita yells at the boys... 
RITA Be nice to your brother, Antonio. Don't make me go get Mommie. 
Trevor's car pulls up.    Rita's taken aback. 
RITA (setting Maricella down) Go play wit' your brothers. 
Rita attempts to thwart him at the sidewalk. 
RITA (almost defensive) Whatcha doin' here, maestro? 
(CONTINUED) 
131   CONTINUED:                                                       131 
TREVOR (with fervor) I want you to come back to school, Rita. You can't afford to miss finals. They won't let you graduate. 
RITA (overlapping) No way. Forget it. I can't. What's wrong wit' you. 
Trevor really does looks like hell. 
TREVOR (beseeching her) Cesar and Stevie won't bother you. That's a promise. 
Something stirs deep inside her. 
RITA (struggles with it) Why'd they have to kill Snowball? 
TREVOR ... They didn't. 
RITA (on the verge of tears now) What's it fuckin' matter?! 'At school shit's for other kids, not me! 
TREVOR That's not true. You're so smart, Rita. Don't you know that? You have an opportunity here to change your life. Please don't throw away everything we've worked for. 
Trevor just stares at her, incredulously. 
Rita lowers her gaze, unable to look him in the eye. Momentous deliberation, and now... 
TREVOR I know what happened with Childress. 
RITA (knitting her eyebrows) What? 
(CONTINUED) 
131   CONTINUED:                                                        131 
TREVOR (beat) He won't ever touch you again. 
RITA (protesting too much) He ain't done nuthin' tuh me. That boy's fulla shit. What's he been sayin'? 
TREVOR Doesn't matter. 
RITA He ain't never touched me no ways. What's he sayin'? He say he fucked me?! He say dat?! (off Trevor's look) He's a damn liar! (erupting again; tears streaming down her face) Get the fuck outta here! I don't need yer damn pity and I don't need you! 
TREVOR (genuinely) But I need you, Rita. 
Beat. 
RITA (hardening) You made a mistake.    Dat's all. 
With that Rita scoops up Maricella and exits. 
132   INT. MR. GARCIA'S OFFICE - SAME DAY (LUNCH PERIOD)                132 
Trevor sits transfixed in front of Garcia.       Still hasn't shaven.

Garcia holds up a handful of phone messages. 
MR. GARCIA They're phone calls about you. Good ones. (MORE)

MR. GARCIA (CONT'D) Cesar's mother told me how you tried to help him. You're evidently a good teacher. You should be commended on your efforts. However... (pause) I'm going to have to let you go. 
Seeing now that the whole house has been tagged with graffiti (not only the garage) as the Rambler pulls into the driveway. With dead calm, Trevor leaves his box of belongings behind and enters the front door, carrying his briefcase.

All three tag-bangers produce firearms... Cesar loads the cylinder chamber on his .357 magnum. Stevie double checks a 7 round clip and a 39 Smith and Wesson. And Paco plays with a .38 caliber revolver that he hides in the deep front pocket of is County-Bens. 
The interior of the Buick snaps with the hard sound of gun metal... cocking hammers, loading cartridges and spinning cylinder chambers... 
... As the gun preparations systematically stop. Cesar now flicks ON an ELECTRIC HAIR CLIPPER, sets it on 'NO CLIP,' and passes it back to Paco. Paco runs the clipper over his head. Hair tumbles off in chunks. Stevie fidgets, picks up a naked one-eyed doll off the floor, raises it INTO VIEW... 
STEVIE Where'd you jack 'dis car from, homes? (referring to doll) 'At's nasty, man.

Now a wet DISH slips from her grasp and SHATTERS on the floor.

Trevor sits on his bed, watching the red orb of the sun disappear over the horizon. He can hear DOOR OPENING and someone moving in his house. 
TREVOR I'm in here, Cesar. 
Cesar, Paco, and Stevie enter the bedroom, guns drawn. 
CESAR Dont' move, mutha fucka! 
Stevie flips on a light. Paco SHOOTS out the TV set in the living room -- an act of intimidation. Cesar jams his .357 under Trevor's chin. Gets in his face. 
CESAR You killed Benny. And you cut off my finger... Say it. 
Trevor stares right into Cesar's eyes, unflinching. 
TREVOR Yeah.   I did. 
STEVIE Told yuh.     Fuckin' A, man. 
PACO Lemme do 'im. 
CESAR No.   This nigga's mine. 
Cesar sticks the gun barrel right between Trevor's eyes ... and squeezes the trigger. Click. An empty sound. 
Trevor blinks. Cesar exhales a malicious laugh.     Opens a fist to reveal six bullets. 
CESAR Ever seen The Deerhunter, ese?

CESAR It's all I got! 
Silence.    Trevor studies him with an enigmatic look. 
TREVOR Well then, I'll take your turn for you... 
He snatches up the pistol and puts it to his head... 
CESAR No!

Stevie's stunned. 
STEVIE What'd he do that for? 
He walks toward the back of the house like a zombie.

CESAR It was my turn. He took it... He dissed me. 
PACO So fuckin' what, man!     He's dead! Let's go! 
Cesar shrugs him off, picks up the .357. 
CESAR I gotta do this. 
PACO Fuck dis shit!     Leave it! 
He tries to pull Cesar away, pleading with him in Spanish, but Cesar shoves him off. 
CESAR I got one chance in six. I'm 'onna beat 'dis bitch... For honor, vato. 
STEVIE No!! 
Paco rushes toward him, but is stopped by the BOOM! of the .357. Frozen in shock, Paco stares down at Cesar's body as Stevie re-enters the kitchen.

THE JACKET 
Written by 
Massy Tadjedin 
Based on a screenplay by 
Marc Rocco 
April 15, 2003 
A pure white screen. Idyllic stillness. All of it looking and feeling like the heavens are supposed to. 
After some seconds of calm, water seems to mist the screen and the slight shifts to the left and then the right suggest this is a man's P.O.V. Then, suddenly, the white screen is tugged and we see it was a sheet covering a presumably dead man. 
WILLIAM STARKS (V.O.) I was 25 years old the first time I died... 
INT. HOSPITAL, KUWAIT, DAY 
One more tug on the sheet and we see, and suddenly hear, from William Starks' P.O.V. the CHAOS of the hospital around him as DOCTORS and NURSES tend as best as they can to the injured soldiers. 
Our glimpse of STARKS reveals a red stretcher -- soaked in blood -- and the severe head wound where a bullet's minced his skull. 
Then, slowly, steadily, a heartbeat is heard over the muffled sounds of the hospital and, as his pulse quickens, so does the pace of the world around him. 
INT. HOSPITAL, KUWAIT, DAY 
WILLIAM STARKS (V.O.) I remember there was so much white everywhere. And I felt peace...even though there was war around me. And I felt alive, even though I knew I was dead. 
INTERN #1 Come on, come on, let's tag these guys and get them out of here. 
An INTERN, clipboard in hand, stands above STARKS' unmoving body with another INTERN (2) beside him. INTERN 1 pulls the rest of the SHEET off of STARKS as the OTHER searches for his DOG TAGS and gently closes his EYES with her hand. 
INTERN #2 [Reading from the TAGS] Starks, William. Born December 25, 
INTERN #1 Wait, so how old? 
INTERN #2 
INTERN #1 [Searching through records] Here he is. William Starks. Born in Vermont. He hasn't got a family listed. The naval hospital'll figure out what to do with him. 
As the INTERN puts the TAGS back down, she meets STARKS' wide- open EYES -- now filled with surfacing tears, sadness, and life. She stares at them curiously and, after some seconds, STARKS blinks and a TEAR runs down his cheek -- jarring her. 
INTERN #2 [Calling out] Oh my God! This soldier is ALIVE! Code blue! CODE BLUE! This man just blinked! 
INTERN #1 He's been tagged already. Worry about the others... [then seeing STARKS blink] Oh shit! Shit! CODE BLUE! We need a doctor! Get a doctor over here now! 
As the MEDICAL STAFF rush over to STARKS, preparing NEEDLES and OXYGEN MASKS, STARKS merely closes his eyes and we follow the now BLOODIED white sheet as it falls to the ground... 
EXT. IRAQI VILLAGE, DAY 
A NEWSANCHOR interviews CAPTAIN ROBERT MEDLEY (30s) -- a particularly photogenic and affable participant. 
CAPTAIN MEDLEY The level of arms on the ground really depends. [Answering a question] But no, I'd have to say we haven't had to engage on the ground as heavily as we might have expected. 
NEWSANCHOR Have you lost any men today, Captain? 
CAPTAIN MEDLEY No. One of my Corporals took a bullet to the head, but it looks like he might make it. Looks that way... 
FLASHBACK TO: 
EXT. IRAQI VILLAGE, DAY 
We see only the HAND, and not the man to whom it belongs, enter the frame and pull the TRIGGER on a gun. The sound pierces the air, and the bullet hits the side of STARKS' head in a FLASH, shaving the skin around it right off. 
EXT. AMERICAN NAVAL HOSPITAL, DAY 
STARKS convalesces in a navy hospital bed -- his head heavily BANDAGED and his arms suited with I.V.'s and dressings -- as a MAJOR, a LIEUTENANT and a DOCTOR stand above him. 
STARKS' face -- now cleaned of the blood that masked it before -- is alert, and striking. Even with the bandages, he remains well-built and strong, like a shot straight to the head would have been the only way for an enemy to take him down. 
DOCTOR Sergeant Starks was very lucky. A little more to the right and it wouldn't have wanted to come out... 
MAJOR But he's never gonna be able to remember what happened? 
DOCTOR It's hard to say. Sergeant Starks could have retrograde amnesia or... [lowering his voice] any form of psychological suppression. It's very common with traumas like this. 
STARKS [Cutting him off] Sergeant Starks is in the room, [beat] and I want to know when I'm going home. 
When he speaks, STARKS maintains the sharp, steady gaze of a man assured of himself, even if he is lost among his surroundings. 
LIEUTENANT Sergeant, you have no surviving family in the States. I'm sure you have friends or distant relatives, but unfortunately we have no record of them yet. 
MAJOR Captain Medley has recommended you for the Purple Heart, Sergeant. 
STARKS lets the tribute roll right off him. He spots the CIGARETTES in the Lieutenant's pocket. 
STARKS Can I have one of those? 
JACKIE You're just gonna walk? 
STARKS Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel. 
STARKS' DOG TAGS are tied to the ZIPPER of one of his bags. 
JACKIE What're those? 
STARKS Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification. 
JACKIE What for? 
STARKS [Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are. 
JACKIE [Still looking at them] Hm. 
STARKS unties them and gives them to her. She reads them. 
STARKS I think I can remember what's on them. 
JACKIE William Starks. [Beat] Thanks. 
CUT TO: 
INT. COURTROOM, SMALL TOWN VERMONT 
STARKS faces the screen with nothing but a cryptic BLACKNESS about him and a confused look on his face as a MENACING VOICE questions him. 
VOICE (O.S.) "Jackie" and "Jean" are the only ...things you know for certain about that day? 
STARKS nods. 
VOICE (O.S.) Are you aware we have no last name, no place of residence, and no record of any physical presence for these "friends" of yours? How's that possible in this day and age? 
STARKS nods as a muffled "Objection" flickers away in the background... 
VOICE (O.S.) I may need to actually hear that answer, Mr. Starks. 
STARKS [Beat] Yes. With Starks' answer, the background of the courtroom is suddenly illuminated and we see that THIS IS STARKS' OWN TRIAL. The VOICE belongs to a satisfied PROSECUTION who turns to face a medium-sized CROWD watching on... 
INT. COURTROOM, SMALL TOWN VERMONT 
There are three KEY WITNESSES called to the stand: CAPTAIN MEDLEY, Starks' commanding officer in the Persian Gulf; DR. HALE, a psychiatrist; and OFFICER NASH, the cop who first came upon the crime scene. Their three testimonies are intercut to present the case against Starks quickly and confusingly -- just like it appears to himself. 
OFFICER NASH [Emotional] Eddie [correcting himself], Officer Harrison, was lying in a pool of his own blood -- on his back. 
DR. HALE William Starks could be blocking the incident. It would explain his well- systematized scheme about the little girl and her mother. A delusion as complex as that can often replace the reality of an incident like this. 
OFFICER NASH [Cont'd] Officer Harrison'd been shot three times. He was long dead by the time we got there. 
DR. HALE I have heard of Gulf War Syndrome. The medical community is only beginning to gather information about it. 
PROSECUTION Gulf War   Syndrome? What the...Why don't we   start diagnosing Hard Life Syndrome   while we're at it? I've gotten a   lot of convictions we could overturn   with that logic... 
CAPTAIN MEDLEY Sergeant Starks was awarded the Purple Heart. That award doesn't applaud violence or murder. [Beat] It applauds honor. 
DR. HALE [Cont'd] His subconscious is blocking it, the same way it began to in the Gulf, particularly as something similarly traumatizing happened to him then. 
The following summations are punctuated by the BLACK FADES between them and the simulated BLACK around them as they speak -- like STARKS, at the beginning of his own testimony. 
PROSECUTION [Disdainfully] It's not a question of whether or not he was sane when he did it?! He absolutely was. Three bullets in one man are three moral failings in another. 
CAPTAIN MEDLEY [Incensed] War isn't a CNN Special. Half the shit that went on couldn't be tidied into a top of the hour headline -- either 'cause it couldn't be said neatly or 'cause it couldn't be said at all. It was ugly. And they don't put ugly on TV. [Looking at Starks] If Starks did kill that officer ... [Beat] You can't hold a man responsible for a damaged mind. 
DEFENSE For God's sake, my client said he thinks he's already died once. He doesn't know what's going on. 
FLASHBACK TO: 
EXT. MURDER SCENE, HIGHWAY, VERMONT, DUSK 
STARKS lies bleeding -- eyes half open -- by OFFICER HARRISON'S dead, bloodied body as falling SNOW slowly whitens them both and covers any FOOTPRINTS that may have been left behind. We hear a distant gavel delivering a distant judgment... 
STARKS [V.O., nearly whispered] I don't know how it happened. STARKS' eyes finally close as he lapses into unconsciousness. 
INT. COURTROOM, SMALL TOWN VERMONT 
The JUDGE nods as he hands the JURY FOREMAN back the verdict. 
JURY FOREMAN On the count of first degree murder, we find the defendant, William Starks, not guilty by reason of insanity. 
EXT. HIGHWAY, RURAL VERMONT, WINTER, DAY 
In his mind, STARKS is walking out of the woods as the sun sets and bounces off the snow all around him. We see JACKIE watching him walk away into the woods. 
JUDGE (O.S.) I hereby sentence you to be committed to a facility for the criminally insane, where I hope that doctors and the proper treatment can help you... 
INT. COURTROOM, SMALL TOWN VERMONT 
The JUDGE sentences STARKS, who stares back vacantly, like a man who checked out of his life long before this judge decided he had to. 
STARKS [Forced to yell] Will you listen to me? I'm not going to hurt you. Please. I didn't mean to bump...I'm sorry. 
ORDERLIES and NURSES, followed by DR. BECKER, surround them now, violently pulling STARKS off the patient. BECKER, familiar with the PATIENT (HAROLD), tries to calm him. 
BECKER It's ok, Harold. It's ok. 
STARKS searches their blurred faces and stops on Becker's as they restrain him and give him more drugs. 
STARKS [To Becker] I don't belong here... 
BECKER [Angrily, to the ORDERLIES] Get him to his room. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
INT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHT 
STARKS is slowly rebounding from the drugs when he hears disquieting FOOTSTEPS in the hall, coming closer and closer... 
What follows happens too quickly for STARKS to react. 
DR. GRIES, NURSE HARDING AND DAMON -- enter Starks' room. They close the door and deftly administer a TRANQUILIZER and a GAG. 
STARKS has no idea what's happening to him as they drag him out, and his STIFLED CRIES ensure no one else does either. 
NURSE HARDING Come on, army boy. Time for some therapy. 
INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHT 
The first face STARKS sees as the world comes into focus is NURSE HARDING'S. Around it loom those of DR. BECKER, DR. GRIES and DAMON. 
A shot of the room shows a constraint-ridden apparatus hanging sternly on the wall. It is THE JACKET: an apparatus designed to encase a man's body. Made of coarse, sickly- stained red ands brown canvas and velcro restraints that would first chafe, then forever burn, the skin they're wrapped around, the JACKET looks medieval. Its appearance suggests its purpose: to slowly STRANGLE THE LIFE OUT OF A MAN. 
STARKS has been stripped of his blue uniform and is lying nearly naked on a burial slab in the cold of the basement. Even under the tranquilizers, STARKS formidably resists them as the ORDERLIES wrestle to strap him in. Then Starks, sensing as anyone would, that something bad is being done to him, wisely stops resisting long enough to petition them. 
STARKS Wait. Wait a minute... Please. 
BECKER motions for them to stop with his hand. STARKS blinks, trying to bring the faces above him into focus... 
STARKS I, I don't belong here. 
BECKER looks into Starks' eyes. Sanity stares back. 
BECKER No. I don't think you do either. [Beat] But neither of us can do anything about that. BECKER barely nods and STARKS is trussed in the JACKET with METAL CLAMPS. BECKER writes some details down, presumably about Starks' treatment. 
A CADAVER DRAWER -- just barely deep enough for a body or tall enough for the height of a nose -- is slid open and STARKS, already dreadfully sheathed in the JACKET, is crammed inside. 
The ORDERLIES slam the cadaver drawer into the wall. 
INT. CADAVER DRAWER 
STARKS is literally entombed alive. Silence. Stolen breath. They bolt the drawer and the CLANG echoes through his body. The BLACKNESS and CLOSENESS of the space choke him as his heart beats the frantic rhythm of his struggle. 
We see only the WHITES of a pair of petrified EYES on a man who's losing it -- hyperventilating, suffocating... for all intents and purposes, dying the worst kind of a death. 
Combing the walls for any sign of an explanation of what's happening to him, STARKS sees a single white DOT -- almost like a fleck of dust -- flitting between undecided SHAPES in the blackness until, slowly, it grows bigger and bigger... 
INT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE 
It's now a PATTERN of WHITE DOTS that changes the more STARKS stares at it. Beneath it seems to be a smaller pattern with formless shapes and figures that STARKS tries to discern before they change into something else. Only after STARKS blinks does he start to see the WHITE of the DOTS is SNOW from a picture that is slowly and terribly coming together in the following glimpses, each hardly longer than the time between BLINKS. 
1) A little river of RED marring the snow around it, spilling from... 
2) OFFICER HARRISON'S mouth just seconds before his last breath. His eyes close and STARKS sees and hears a FLASH... 
3) From the barrel of a GUN fired near him. 
BLOOD sprays STARKS' hands as he looks down at them and realizes he's in the scene and not just watching it. He looks up from his hands and sees in similar flashes... 
1) The snow beneath the BLOOD changing to DIRT as STARKS stares at it. This time, the little river of RED comes from... 
2) The BODIES of IRAQI villagers, all still except one... 
3) That of a IRAQI WOMAN. She unflinchingly lays her hand in the entrails of a CORPSE and smears its blood on her face just before she lies back down among the dead, content to be one of them. 
The only SOUNDS during these dreadful images have been a trapped man's anxious BREATHS and the BEATS of a HEART pumping so fast it could be a drum... 
The screen goes BLACK and QUIVERS as STARKS clenches his eyes shut. 
INT. CADAVER DRAWER 
Just then, as the MUSCLE beneath his eyes starts to VIBRATE, something terrible and wet falls from the ceiling of the drawer. PING! Right on his eye. The drop of WATER is enough to send this man right over the edge. 
STARKS' EYES roll back into his head and start to flutter, shaking the SCREEN right along them until... 
INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE 
STARKS stands outside his body, looking at the wall of drawers he is in. He bends down to look more closely at a STAIN on the floor -- DRIED BLOOD -- and as he runs his HAND over it and stands back up, he is back in the... 
INT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE 
As STARKS blinks, TEARS fall and he hears, over it all, a counseling voice... 
MACKENZIE (O.S.) When they take you out to the woods tonight and invite the wolves, dance with them. 
The TERRIBLE SOUNDS become less terrible as they fade away. 
MACKENZIE (O.S.) They don't eat you when there's music playing. 
The scene morphs slowly and the following IMAGES appear vaguely -- forming the walls of the TUNNEL around him. 
1) C.U. A WOMAN'S NECK and a small child's HAND 
2) INT. STAIRWAY, OLD HOUSE (STARKS' CHILDHOOD HOME) 
3) C.U. A black and white PHOTOGRAPH 
4) EXT. CREEK: A shot of clear water, not too deep... 
5) EXT. A NEW ENGLAND BEACH 
6) EXT. DESERT, IRAQ: A sublime sunset... 
STARKS walks up uneasily to the wall and touches the IMAGES. They move like they're liquid and, when they settle, the whole wall is replaced with one large IMAGE of a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN -- a waitress -- standing at the counter of a COFFEE SHOP, moving a STRAND OF HAIR out of her face with her hand. 
STARKS blinks slowly -- struck by this dream of her. He reaches out and closes his PALM around her like he might catch hold of the moment with this simple gesture. 
The whole WALL OF IMAGES twinkles marvelously, as we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DINER, SMALL TOWN, VERMONT, CHRISTMAS EVE 
The WAITRESS (early 20s) -- tired, with kind eyes, soft skin and a beautiful mouth that hasn't smiled in a long time -- emerges from the diner. Even with no effort, she is remarkably pretty. 
From her UNIFORM, we know that her day was spent there. STARKS simply stares at this WOMAN who seems markedly removed from the world around her. The only fact she wears on her is that she's tired. 
She spots STARKS and can't help but do a double-take. Both are momentarily taken with each other, though she tries to hide any indication that she is. 
INT. WAITRESS' CAR 
She gets in her old car and starts it. As it warms up, she looks for STARKS in her REARVIEW MIRROR and sees he's still there. 
He starts to walk over to her when she jumps out of her car. 
EXT. PARKING LOT, DINER, VERMONT, CHRISTMAS EVE 
The WAITRESS treads angrily towards STARKS. 
WAITRESS Where do you think you're going? 
STARKS looks at her. He doesn't know anymore than she does. 
WAITRESS You gonna answer me? 
STARKS just stares. 
WAITRESS If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today. 
STARKS [Beat] I'm not deaf. 
WAITRESS Good. 
She turns and gets back in her car, slamming the door shut. She starts to drive and STARKS stares after her. 
After a few hundred yards, she SLAMS on the brakes and turns the car round, coming back. Then she jumps out of the car and heads back in the diner, without looking over at STARKS. 
EXT. DINER, SMALL TOWN VERMONT, SOME SECONDS LATER 
She comes out -- this time PURSE in hand -- and sighs at Starks. 
WAITRESS [As if she owes him an explanation] I forgot my purse. 
STARKS nods slowly. The WAITRESS gets in her car and looks again at STARKS in her REARVIEW MIRROR. He has hardly any winter gear on him -- no gloves, no hat, no coat -- just jeans and a flannel. He looks lost among his surroundings, as much because he doesn't know where he is as because he doesn't look like he belongs there. 
She reverses towards him. 
WAITRESS In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here. 
STARKS [Beat] Thanks. 
She looks him over and then rests her hands on the wheel. 
WAITRESS All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister? 
STARKS I'm not sure. 
WAITRESS Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options. 
Being cold and freezing are his options. 
WAITRESS Shit! That was one of my good glasses! 
As she presumably cleans it up, we stay on STARKS who slowly gains hold of himself. She comes back, DRINK in hand and pushes the STRAND OF HAIR in her face back the same way she did when he saw her in the tunnel. Even through her weariness, she looks radiant under the Christmas lights. She takes a long SIP. 
WAITRESS [Noticing he's shaken] Hey, you ok? 
STARKS [Beat] Yeah, I'm fine. 
WAITRESS You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch. 
And sadly, no plans for the evening anyway. She looks back -- her EYES even more tired from the liquor. 
STARKS I'm not gonna hurt you. 
WAITRESS [Softly] I know. [Clearing her throat] I'm gonna go take a bath. Make yourself at home. You know, fix yourself something to eat if you're hungry or anything. There's nothing to steal, but don't be a jerk and take something anyway. And don't snoop, ok? 
STARKS Ok. [Beat] My name's William by the way. 
WAITRESS [Shakes her head] No, no. Let's not do the name stuff, 'cause you see, I don't want to meet you. I may want to help you tonight, but I don't want to know you. Honest. 
STARKS nods as she walks out. 
EXT. YARD BEHIND WAITRESS' APARTMENT, EVENING 
STARKS, still without a coat, collects some WOOD... 
INT. KITCHEN, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, EVENING 
STARKS looks in her fridge. There's not much to work with -- just some JARS and plenty of VODKA. 
INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, SOME TIME LATER 
STARKS has lit a FIRE and set out a feeble dinner for them when the WAITRESS comes out of the bedroom in sweats. 
WAITRESS What's this? 
STARKS The best I could do with what was in your fridge. She looks and sees a SANDWICH on a BUN in one plate and a SANDWICH on two different colors of TOAST on the other. 
Then she looks over at the fire; it's obvious from the way she looks at it that it's been years, if ever, since someone's done something like this for her. 
STARKS I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if... 
WAITRESS No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks. 
She turns and goes in the kitchen, calling out to him... 
WAITRESS You want a drink? 
STARKS Sure. 
INT. KITCHEN, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, NIGHT 
As she makes their DRINKS, a curious LOOK crosses her face, just for a second. 
INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, A LITTLE WHILE LATER 
They've sat down to eat under the blinking CHRISTMAS LIGHTS. 
WAITRESS This is pretty good. Considering... 
STARKS Thanks. 
They eat quietly for a second. STARKS looks at her, then down at his food, still subtly stunned by it all. 
STARKS So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing. 
WAITRESS Yup. That's me. 
STARKS You like it? 
WAITRESS [Beat] I do it. 
STARKS Have you always been a waitress? 
WAITRESS [Remembering sadly] No. I used to be a nurse. 
STARKS [Beat] Why'd you stop? 
WAITRESS Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from? 
STARKS I don't know, but I think part of it's... 
STARKS looks around as he decides to be honest with her. 
STARKS That I don't really know what's real. 
She stares at him until a small sympathetic smile appears on her lips. 
WAITRESS Well, good for you. 
It's DR. GRIES, racked with guilt, who pulls Starks out... 
He winces at the sight of the BLOOD and SWEAT streaked across Starks' face. DR. GRIES checks his pulse and cleans his face as best as he can with a WET TOWEL. 
DR. GRIES William, can you hear me? 
His VOICE echoes in the morgue, sounding to Starks, as it does to us, faint and distant. DR. GRIES drips some WATER in Starks' mouth. As some of it trickles out, it runs into the JACKET, burning STARKS' chafed skin. 
STARKS' EYES flutter and DR. GRIES pushes the drawer back in, afraid of what they've done to this man... 
INT. CADAVER DRAWER 
STARKS clenches his face and pleadingly closes his eyes. FIVE SECONDS OF TOTAL BLACKNESS and SILENCE and he's back in... 
INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' (JACKIE'S) APARTMENT, NIGHT 
Only now, he's kneeling beside her sleeping FACE, just looking at it. STARKS doesn't know what's going on but her serene, sleeping face steadies him. He can only call out the name he thinks she might respond to... 
STARKS Jackie? Jackie? 
Sure enough, she answers with a STIR in her sleep. 
JACKIE Hm... 
We see, in STARKS' eyes, the unbelievable connection: she is the same little girl he met only a few weeks ago in 1992. 
STARKS [Swallowing, softly] Jackie? [Beat] What year is it? 
JACKIE [In a drunken slumber] What? 
STARKS What year is it? 
JACKIE [Barely opening her eyes] 
STARKS looks around as JACKIE moves in her sleep, almost falling off the couch. STARKS picks her up and, in her sleep, she WRAPS her arms around his neck. 
INT. BEDROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, NIGHT 
STARKS tenderly lays her down on the bed... 
INT. LIVING ROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, NIGHT 
STARKS picks up his DOG TAGS from the console, looks around, spots the TELEVISION and fumbles a bit as he figures out how to turn it on. STARKS sits down, throws back the rest of JACKIE'S DRINK and another shot and looks around nervously, unable to explain what's happening to him... 
FADE TO: 
INT. BEDROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, CHRISTMAS MORNING 
JACKIE sits in her sleep as she wakes up, clearly hung over. 
INT. BATHROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, CHRISTMAS MORNING 
As JACKIE closes the MEDICINE CABINET, she sees her hungover reflection in it. 
She puts her face under the WATER and lets it restore some color and life in her. As she comes up, that's when she remembers the night before and the voice she barely heard in her sleep. 
STARKS [O.S., echoing distantly] Jackie? [Beat] What year is it? She SHOOTS UP from the sink, staring at her reflection. 
INT. LIVING ROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, SECONDS LATER 
JACKIE spots STARKS asleep on the couch -- newspaper strewn all around him and the TV still on. He's holding the TAGS. 
She kneels down close to his face and stares at him for awhile before STARKS is jarred. He defensively GRABS HER WRIST as his EYES BURST OPEN, startling her. 
JACKIE [Desperately] Who are you? 
STARKS lets his GRIP loosen. 
STARKS [Beat] I'm William Starks. 
A short look of SHOCK cross her face before she leaps up. 
JACKIE Get the hell out of my house! 
JACKIE grabs the nearest object -- the IRON FORK from the FIREPLACE set -- and holds it, shaking, against STARKS. STARKS stays calm; he hardly expected a different reaction. 
JACKIE What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything. 
STARKS [Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me. 
JACKIE If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police. 
STARKS [Remembering] Your mom was passed out on the side of the road when I found you. Her name was Jean. [Beat] She was dizzy the whole time... 
JACKIE [Trembling] Why would you do something like this? I tried to help you. 
STARKS Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it. 
JACKIE What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license? 
CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER. 
And over it all is the now more distant CLANK OF METAL as the drawer is opened and the nightmare momentarily ended... 
FADE TO BLACK. 
INT. MORGUE, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS DAY 
DR. GRIES, DR. BECKER, DAMON and NURSE HARDING enter the room. 
BECKER You left him in all night? 
NURSE HARDING Shit, he's probably dead. 
DR. GRIES [Defensively] I tried to ask you if we should leave him in yesterday... 
BECKER Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer. 
DR. GRIES We never should have done this to him... 
BECKER Well, what are we gonna do about it now? 
Nothing is Gries' answer. Still, Becker seems to share the concern. 
BECKER motions for them to open the drawer. They pull him out. STARKS looks cold and wrecked. 
DR. GRIES Is he? [Impatiently] Is he dead? 
BECKER feels for a pulse and seems surprised to find one. 
BECKER No. [To Harding and Damon] Get him upstairs. 
INT. WARD, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS DAY 
DR. LORENSON walks into the ward to check on STARKS. The attending NURSE is walking around the ward. 
LORENSON Where's William Starks. 
NURSE I'm not sure. Dr. Becker had him moved. 
INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, DAY 
DR. LORENSON walks anxiously down the halls of the hospital, peering into every room, looking for Starks. 
INT. ANOTHER HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, DAY 
DR. LORENSON spots BECKER walking out the DOORS of the hospital and RUNS after him, in only his white coat... 
EXT. PARKING LOT, ALPINE GROVE, DAY (CONT'D) 
LORENSON [Calling out after him] Dr. Becker! Dr. Becker!...Tom, wait! 
DR. BECKER stops walking and waits a moment, registering the voice, before he turns around to face Dr. Lorenson. 
LORENSON [Out of breath] Where's William Starks? 
BECKER He's recovering on the third floor. 
LORENSON Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic! 
BECKER Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious? 
LORENSON He'll be a zombie in a few days, Tom. His behavior's hardly suggested he needed neuroleptics. 
BECKER And you know that from what, a couple two-minute stares across a room? 
LORENSON [Firmly] He didn't need anti-psychotics, if that's even all you're giving him...? 
BECKER ignores Lorenson's insinuation and merely turns his CHEEK all the way round towards Lorenson so he can see the BANDAGE from the CUT Starks gave him. 
BECKER [Steadily] After he slashed me with a hospital instrument, I determined, in my professional opinion, that Mr. Starks, needed a little placating. 
LORENSON [Beat] You sure he wasn't provoked? 
BECKER You sure you want to begin making that kind of insinuation? [Beat] I took five stitches during a routine therapy session. 
LORENSON I'm sure he took some, too. 
BECKER [Smirking, unphased] Happens sometimes when you've got to restrain them. You watch the rest of us work. You know that. 
LORENSON [Appealing to him] Our patients are sick. 
BECKER Yes, they are. 
LORENSON looks at BECKER; he knows he's hiding something. 
LORENSON He's not gonna end up like Casey, Tom. Whatever happened to him is not going to "happen" to Starks. I don't know what you're trying to do here ...but he's not a lab animal, Tom. You can't reprogram him no matter the drugs or the treatment. 
BECKER Jesus, you really don't let up, do you? Just because you failed your patient doesn't necessarily mean the rest of us did, too. [Beat] Sorry to tarnish your war hero's image, but he is psychotic. 
BECKER Yes. [Caustically] And that's the sun and you're on earth. [Beat] And I know you know better. 
STARKS begins to piece if together. BECKER, as we begin to see, is right. It is 1992 in Alpine Grove. 
STARKS I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there. 
BECKER In where? 
STARKS [Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket. 
The NURSE gives Becker a knowing look -- suggesting Starks really is delusional. Becker doesn't even flinch as STARKS tries to get a better look at Becker's face. 
BECKER We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to. 
STARKS That wasn't a fucking restraint. 
BECKER Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is. 
STARKS' EYES widen with alarm as BECKER reaches for the I.V. in his arm, lingering on it long enough that Starks braces himself for an ATTACK of some sort. But Becker just looks back innocently as he adjusts it. 
BECKER Relax. 
STARKS Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here. 
BECKER [Pointedly] Of course you're not. 
Then he clarifies, wryly enough for Starks to catch it. 
BECKER You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition. 
STARKS Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer. 
BECKER nods diagnostically. The NURSE's nonchalance about it as she LEAVES the room further disquiets STARKS. 
STARKS I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light. 
BECKER I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey... 
STARKS I don't give a shit about your patient! 
BECKER I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather. 
STARKS squints as he searches out Becker's face. 
BECKER Ted raped and sodomized a seven-year old girl. [Beat] His lawyers asked me to have a look at him because, after his deeds were done... he climbed into the trees of the forest where he killed her and woofed like a dog. He couldn't even remember his name when I spoke to him, but, curiously enough, he could speak back. [Beat] Ted never went to prison because everyone -- including me -- was convinced he was sick. So he came here. 
BECKER leans into Starks' view to make sure he's listening. STARKS is. 
BECKER Then one day a little girl came with her mother to visit a relative and I caught Ted stealing looks at her -- the kind you really have to steal if you know what I mean. [Beat] I asked Ted then if he could remember what the little girl who he had... slain ...was wearing. [Beat] He gave me a look I'll never forget, and, when he answered, it wasn't with a color or any sort of physical description I'd expect. "Oh yes," he said. "I remember it. I remember it well." [Beat] Those were actually his last words I think. 
BECKER's expression bears a hunting mixture of anger and remorse as he recounts Ted's tale. 
STARKS We are not birds of a feather. 
BECKER Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of. 
BECKER gets up and, as he moves out of the light, STARKS sees his BANDAGED CHEEK, reinforcing his memory of what happened... 
STARKS [Provokingly] What happened to your cheek, Dr. Becker? 
BECKER I was careless. Happens sometimes. 
FADE TO: 
INT. STARKS' ROOM, RECOVERY WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 1992 
STARKS looks out on the SNOW-COVERED GROUNDS from his room on the third floor. He seems pacified for the moment. 
INT. HALLWAY, RECOVERY WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY 
Everything about the dingy hospital punctuates the sad mechanics of managing madness. CATATONIC PATIENTS and dated equipment litter the hall and, as we follow a NURSE who walks among them, we spot STARKS -- ARMS suspended in air and GLAZED EYES fixed on the ceiling -- pretending to be one of them. 
His ARMS fall and he wipes his dried MOUTH as soon as she passes. STARKS has successfully made it out of his room. She turns one corner as STARKS hustles to turn another... 
INT. DAY ROOM, ALPINE GROVE 
STARKS is almost   there. As RANDOM ORDERLIES pass him, STARKS lets his posture   collapse as he despondently hangs his head down so low they   can't see his face. They pass, and STARKS starts scuttling   towards the door to the outside. 
As soon as he reaches it and is outside in the cold -- with only his BLUE PATIENT UNIFORM -- Starks walks normally, like he no longer remembers the risks. Instead he remembers what Jackie told him. 
JACKIE [O.S.] They found William Starks' body dead in the snow. 
STARKS [O.S.] How'd he die? 
JACKIE [O.S.] I don't know. But he did die. 
EXT. GROUNDS, ALPINE GROVE 
STARKS leans down -- seemingly oblivious to the cold -- and lifts some snow to his mouth, TASTING it like a man who needs to affirm he is still alive. He's so rapt that LORENSON's VOICE takes him by surprise. 
STARKS He was the only family I remember. 
DR. MORGAN [Nodding] I'll see what I can find out about Dr. Becker. And maybe Dr. Lorenson will know something. 
INT. WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 2004 
Dr. MORGAN leads JACKIE and STARKS through a ward. STARKS looks around in disbelief; it's more like a hospital now than it ever was in 1993. 
INT. RECEPTION AREA, LORENSON'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, 2004 
As they arrive outside Lorenson's office, MORGAN turns to them. 
DR. MORGAN Let me just tell her we're here. 
DR. MORGAN goes inside and JACKIE takes STARKS' HAND as they wait. It's hardly more than a couple seconds when LORENSON appears in the doorway. She looks at STARKS curiously and the two share a very lengthy, intense STARE. 
DR. LORENSON -- now in her 50s -- walks closer to Starks suspiciously. For his part, STARKS doesn't look as unfamiliar with Lorenson as he should; this doesn't escape Lorenson. 
LORENSON Hello. I'm Beth Lorenson. 
She puts out a hand that is trembling slightly. 
LORENSON It's nice to meet you, Mr. Starks... 
STARKS hesitates before he takes Lorenson's hand. There is something very eerie about the exchange. STARKS quickly lets go and LORENSON turns to JACKIE... 
LORENSON And you are...? 
JACKIE looks back uncomfortably. 
JACKIE I'm just William's friend. 
LORENSON looks over both of them acutely and then calmly turns to Dr. Morgan. 
LORENSON I think we'll be fine from here. Thanks, Stanley. 
INT. LORENSON'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, 2004 
LORENSON leans against her desk while STARKS and JACKIE sit in the chairs. As they talk, each seems cautious in his exchange -- not knowing what the other one does or doesn't know. 
LORENSON My God you look exactly like him. 
STARKS I never knew my father. Did you? 
LORENSON Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient. 
STARKS Why? 
LORENSON considers her answer. 
LORENSON At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things. 
STARKS You thought my father was crazy? 
LORENSON No. I don't think he was crazy. He needed help...but he wasn't crazy. [Beat] Your father actually helped me with a case of mine. 
LORENSON waits to see if STARKS knows what she is talking about. 
STARKS What case? 
LORENSON I was working with a boy named Eugene. 
STARKS shows no recognition but JACKIE does. 
JACKIE Who was Eugene? 
LORENSON [Peaked] He was a friend's son. [Beat] Are you familiar with the case? 
JACKIE Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help? 
LORENSON It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him. 
JACKIE How? 
LORENSON He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him. 
JACKIE I don't understand. 
LORENSON I still don't either, even after all these years. 
STARKS Do you know how my father died? 
LORENSON [Unconvincingly] I don't know how much I remember but I seem to think it was from a... cut or blow of some sort or another. 
STARKS How'd he get it? 
LORENSON [Beat] I don't know. 
STARKS But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was... 
STARKS leans closer, locating all the proof he needs: the stained metal -- still reddened and browned with DRIED BLOOD -- and the part of the morgue slab he CLAWED his NAILS into when he was in it. JACKIE looks at it in disbelief. 
STARKS Yes, it was. [Softly] My fingers were the only things I could move. [Beat] Dead bodies don't bleed. And they certainly can't claw so hard they dent metal. 
INT. HALLWAY, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE 
STARKS and JACKIE are leaving the MORGUE, when STARKS spots DAMON, now hardly a hair of the bully he was before. DAMON stares at him curiously; STARKS glares back furiously. 
DAMON You folks ain't supposed to be down here. 
JACKIE We were just leaving. 
DAMON doesn't take his eyes off Starks. 
DAMON Do I know you from somewhere? 
STARKS You may have known my father, William Starks. DAMON smiles, remembering... 
DAMON That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son. 
STARKS He didn't either. 
DAMON [With a dirty laugh] I'll be damned. He musta been 12 when he had you. [Beat] You could be his ghost. 
STARKS Did you know my father? 
DAMON Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right? 
STARKS looms strangely over DAMON in this exchange. 
STARKS You wouldn't happen to know how he died, would you? 
DAMON [Slightly apprehensive] No, I don't. I just remember them finding his body. 
STARKS You don't know any more, Damon? 
DAMON [Shocked] How'd you know my name? 
STARKS My father used to talk about you. 
DAMON Oh yeah, what'd he say? 
Damon's eyes betray his unease. 
STARKS He said you were a sadistic fuck that belonged in jail. 
DAMON is shocked, and cowed. So much that he shakes as he looks for his bearings. 
DAMON Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me... 
STARKS That's too bad. 
DAMON I thought you said you never knew your father. 
STARKS I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death? 
DAMON I don't know what you're talking about, man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it. 
STARKS starts to see a shaking man who stands confused and distraught before him. 
STARKS He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it. 
DAMON I never touched your father! I swear! Damon's eyes are filled with dishonesty, tears and a craven FEAR. STARKS leans in closer to DAMON as he remembers... 
STARKS You know something, Damon? You're like a mule. You're real stubborn. But there's ways of fixin' that. All you need is a good stick. [Beat] Here's your stick. Live with it. 
STARKS looks like he could easily bash Damon's head against the wall, but instead he lets it go and walks away. 
EXT. CEMETERY, ALPINE GROVE GROUNDS, 2004, DAY 
STARKS is standing above his own headstone: WILLIAM STARKS, December 25, 1967 - January 1, 1993. Next to his grave is that of RUDY MACKENZIE. STARKS looks down sadly at both. JACKIE comes up behind him. 
JACKIE How long do we have? 
STARKS I don't know. 
JACKIE They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed. 
STARKS looks scared and lost -- like it's all catching up to him. And like he might be being taken out of the Jacket. 
STARKS How far away is that? 
PAGE MISSING 
JACKIE kisses his SCARS -- from the war and the Jacket -- and STARKS lifts her higher so he can look at her as they make love for the first time. 
INT. BEDROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, NIGHT 
JACKIE is lying in STARKS' arms, running her FINGERS over one of the SCARS on his chest. STARKS strokes her hair. 
STARKS 
LORENSON nods, trying to mask his dismay but failing. 
STARKS You don't believe me. 
LORENSON [Testing him] Well, what year do you think it is now? STARKS [Exasperated] I'm not delusional. I know it's 1992. Same as every sane person. 
LORENSON Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like? 
STARKS It doesn't look all that different. 
LORENSON The future doesn't look different? 
STARKS No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from. 
LORENSON What about the world? 
STARKS I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life. 
LORENSON looks at STARKS, unintentionally patronizing. 
LORENSON Do you think you're traveling in time? Is that it? 
STARKS shakes his head and momentarily challenges Lorenson simply with his air of calm resolve. 
STARKS Not everyone in here is crazy, Doc. 
LORENSON searches for another approach. 
LORENSON [Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe? 
STARKS Maybe. 
LORENSON [Matter-of-factly] Did he tell you he tried to kill his wife? 
STARKS nods. 
LORENSON MacKenzie locked himself up in his house for two months and nearly starved himself to death before he was brought here. All because his wife left him for another man. 
STARKS moves to put his cigarette out and his I.V. almost falls out of his arm. LORENSON makes a move to adjust it and STARKS flinches perceptibly, startling LORENSON. 
STARKS [Adjusting it himself] Maybe that just makes him weak, not crazy. Or maybe he is crazy. [Beat] Still doesn't make me think I am. 
(MORE) 
STARKS [Adjusting it himself] And, judging by the fact that you just told me about another patient, it doesn't even make you think I am, so what don't you work on persuading yourself first. 
LORENSON Why don't you help me? 
STARKS Because I don't have time. 
LORENSON Why not? 
STARKS I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it. 
LORENSON And how do you know that? 
STARKS Because of the future. I know what's going to happen. 
LORENSON William, that is just another facet of my delusions. 
Then, STARKS remembers the only thing that might help him. He pauses, trying to recall as much of it as he can. 
STARKS And what about your work with Eugene -- the kid? Is that another facet of my delusions? 
LORENSON -- having prepared to continue -- is bowled over at the mention of her patient. She loses all color and calm in her features. 
LORENSON How do you know about Eugene? 
STARKS You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me. 
LORENSON doesn't know what to say. 
LORENSON [Somewhat angrily] How do you know about Eugene!? 
STARKS [Shaking his head in disbelief] You told me. It's like two parts of you talking through me. Look, judging from your reaction, there's no other way I could know about him. 
LORENSON There obviously is, so what don't you just tell me how you found out about him. 
STARKS looks at her convincingly. 
STARKS Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true. 
LORENSON I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions. 
STARKS NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me! 
LORENSON One thing's got nothing to do with the other. 
STARKS And wound up in a better cage. [Beat] But I still want to make a deal. 
BECKER looks understandably disgusted and STARKS proceeds with the calculation of someone who is guilty. 
STARKS See, the deluxe lab animal treatment I've been receiving -- well, I don't think it's worked. I woke up today and realized... [eerily lowering his voice] ...I don't think I'm cured. So really, what was the point? Torture? I think that's still sort of illegal in some states -- though we'll have to check on Vermont. And, how's this for the cherry on top: it seems my physician is a pill-popping freak. [Beat] Last time I checked, that makes some pretty good copy for a lot of these news shows. [Humbly, deftly] "I don't remember everything they did to me. I just remember the worst parts." I think I should be sitting down when I say it, don't you think? 
It takes BECKER some seconds to swallow this. 
BECKER I think...I have to think about it. 
BECKER cocks his head to one side as he does. Then he slowly makes his way over to STARKS and leans in closer to him. STARKS instinctively raises his hand to his HEAD -- prepared to be defensive if he has to be. If this is the moment when he's killed. 
But BECKER only YANKS the I.V. angrily out of Starks' arm, tearing his skin with it. 
BECKER I think your story needs a little fleshing out before it's ready to go. 
BECKER turns to leave as STARKS bleeds onto the floor. 
BECKER I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off. 
STARKS You sure you know where to find one? 
BECKER I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks. 
STARKS And what does that mean? 
BECKER Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to. 
STARKS smirks at the hypocrisy he sees. 
STARKS Becker, how do you sleep at night? 
BECKER You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug. 
BECKER leaves without looking back and STARKS closes his eyes, breathing a sigh of relief that it's over. 
INT. NURSE STATION, ALPINE GROVE, 1992, EVENING 
LORENSON, dressed to leave, stops to talk to NINA, one of the evening nurses. 
LORENSON Nina, William Starks is to stay in ICU all night. If anything is supposed to change, I want to be called about it. 
NINA Sure, Dr. Lorenson. 
INT. LORENSON'S HOME, VERMONT, 1992 
LORENSON comes home to an unremarkable apartment to find a thin, young mother, TALIA YAZDI, and her eleven year-old mute, and seemingly retarded son, EUGENE, waiting for her outside her door. 
LORENSON Hi. [Beat] Sorry I'm late. 
TALIA It's ok. [To Eugene] Hi, Eugene. 
EUGENE returns her greeting with a blank stare. 
INT. LORENSON'S HOME, VERMONT, SOME TIME LATER 
LORENSON sets her things down on the kitchen table as TALIA starts to tidy things around the apartment. 
LORENSON Talia, I need to ask you something. 
TALIA looks at LORENSON. 
TALIA What is it? 
LORENSON Have you told anyone about my sessions with Eugene? 
TALIA [With an accent] Of course not. [Off Lorenson's still doubtful look] I swear I haven't. I wouldn't do that to Eugene, or you. You know that. 
LORENSON Has anyone been asking about him? 
TALIA No. I would have told you. 
LORENSON nods. She believes her. 
INT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, 1992 
STARKS spots DAMON standing cautiously in the hall. 
INT. NURSE STATION, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, 1992 
We see (but don't hear) HARDING speak to NINA as DAMON slips into STARKS' ROOM. NINA seems sufficiently distracted. 
INT. STARKS' ROOM, SECONDS LATER 
DAMON flashes a KNIFE at STARKS. 
DAMON No funny business or we can make this a lot fucking harder for you. 
One look at the KNIFE and the SAME QUESTION burns once more... 
STARKS They're not. 
JACKIE [Beat, lost] No. 
JACKIE notices how COLD Starks looks. 
JACKIE Maybe they're out. 
STARKS nods. 
INT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2004, DAY 
STARKS rubs his hands together as he looks out the windows and sees NO CARS or PEOPLE on the street. JACKIE watches him despairingly. 
JACKIE How much time do we have? 
STARKS [Distracted] I don't know. 
JACKIE What? What are you thinking? 
STARKS There're no cars on this street. 
JACKIE looks around; there really aren't. 
JACKIE Yeah, you're right. But wait, how can that be? 
STARKS turns to JACKIE, thinking. 
STARKS I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it? 
JACKIE I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are. 
STARKS Then why isn't there anyone around? 
JACKIE [Beat] I don't know. 
STARKS runs his hand over his head and closes his eyes in desperation. 
JACKIE What are you doing? 
STARKS doesn't answer. 
JACKIE William! William! 
STARKS opens his eyes. She sighs in relief. 
JACKIE Maybe he's gone somewhere. He'll have to come back. 
STARKS starts to shake his head in disbelief, when suddenly, he realizes... 
STARKS Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it? 
JACKIE It's Sunday. 
STARKS [Nodding] It's Sunday. 
JACKIE So? 
STARKS looks ecstatic with hope. 
STARKS Look where these people live. 
A small, beautiful, removed place. 
STARKS They've got lives to be grateful for. 
JACKIE William, you're not making sense. 
STARKS [Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is. 
EXT. STREETS, SHELBOURNE 
JACKIE and STARKS head back to the only MAIN STREET in the town. As they approach the town church, they start to see a ROW of cars parallel-parked on the street. 
JACKIE pulls up to the entrance of the CHURCH. 
INT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2004, DAY 
STARKS watches JACKIE get out of the car and walk up to the doors of the CHURCH. 
EXT. CHURCH, SHELBOURNE, 2004 
JACKIE boldly opens the CHURCH door. 
INT. CHURCH, SHELBOURNE, 2004 
JACKIE sees the town seated in the Church. The PRIEST looks up at her briefly and some people turn around, but she closes the DOOR before she causes a major interruption. 
INT. CHURCH, SHELBOURNE, 2004 
BECKER How did you come to know their names? 
STARKS You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker. 
BECKER I don't understand... 
STARKS I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it? 
BECKER I didn't put you in Alpine Grove. 
STARKS No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket. 
BECKER [Stoically] I was sorry when I heard you died. I was, but...how was I to know you didn't shoot that police officer? 
STARKS The same way you just said I didn't without my ever telling you. [Beat] And that still doesn't excuse what you did. Just because you had keys to a cage didn't mean you had animals inside. [Beat] You've earned your guilt, Becker. 
STARKS shares a last look with Becker before he walks away towards the car. 
INT. JACKIE'S CAR, DAY, 2004 
JACKIE and STARKS sit inside the parked car as STARKS touches his head. 
JACKIE That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you. 
STARKS No, he didn't. 
JACKIE What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you. 
And with those words, JACKIE starts to break down. 
STARKS No one's killing anyone. 
STARKS takes her hand and runs it over his head. 
STARKS Touch me. I'm okay. 
STARKS looks at her with love, understanding and, for the first time, a sense of peace. He strokes her hair to calm her down. 
STARKS If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face. 
JACKIE Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we? 
STARKS looks at her without answering. JACKIE wipes her eyes, fastens STARKS' seat belt, and seeing that Starks' EYES have started to flutter, starts driving. In the distance, the barely audible sound of the DRAWER opening, and their time ending, is heard. 
STARKS Where are we going? 
JACKIE To the hospital. 
EXT. HIGHWAY, VERMONT, DAY, 2004 
JACKIE and STARKS speed on the highway. As STARKS sleeps, JACKIE keeps looking over at him like it's a way to make sure he stays with her. 
INT. HOSPITAL, VERMONT, DAY, 2004 
JACKIE helps STARKS -- who's severely weakened at this point -- to the nurse's station. CLAIRE is there. 
JACKIE Claire, I need help. 
CLAIRE helps JACKIE, and they take him into a room. From afar, we hear CLAIRE asking about him. 
STARKS What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker? 
JACKIE Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through. 
CLAIRE Jesus, what's happened to him? 
INT. ROOM, HOSPITAL, VERMONT, DAY, 2004 
JACKIE helps CLAIRE do for STARKS what they can; it doesn't seem like much at this point. 
STARKS Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her. 
JACKIE Ok. Ssh. Rest. 
INT. OFFICE, HOSPITAL, 2004 
JACKIE stands above a PRINTER as it prints the information she's looked up about Dr. Lorenson. The PAPER gets jammed, and that's when JACKIE completely loses it. She WRESTLES with the printer as if it were responsible for what's happening. 
Then she realizes she's not alone. She looks back and sees CLAIRE, watching from the doorway, with a sympathetic look in her eyes. 
JACKIE [In a panic] He's not...? 
CLAIRE No, no. [Beat] Not yet. But he doesn't have long. Are you sure you don't want a doctor to look at him? 
JACKIE No! It won't do any good. [Beat] Please, Claire. They won't understand. 
CLAIRE acquiesces with her eyes. 
INT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE 
STARKS is suddenly in the waiting area outside Lorenson's office -- still severely weakened. 
He walks slowly to the OFFICE DOOR and feebly knocks. LORENSON answers and STARKS falls into her arms. 
LORENSON [Stunned] Oh dear God. 
INT. LORENSON'S OFFICE 
LORENSON has laid STARKS down on the COUCH in her office. STARKS can barely talk. He spews as much of it as he can out in his feverish state... 
STARKS I'm William Starks. I'm not his son. And...and the kid you work with. Your friend's son...Eugene... 
LORENSON is stilled by the words STARKS just spoke. 
LORENSON I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you? 
STARKS How...how do you know? 
LORENSON You told me this was how it happened. 
STARKS I did? 
LORENSON Yeah. 
STARKS clutches his side in pain as they prepare to take him out. 
STARKS Who...who kills me? 
LORENSON You have nothing to fear, William. 
But when we look to see STARKS' reaction, he's not there... 
INT. BECKER'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, EVENING 
BECKER is dressed to leave the hospital when he suddenly decides not to. He takes off his coat and his gloves, but not his SCARF, and walks out of his office with a decided urgency. 
INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, 1992 
BECKER pulls STARKS out of the drawer and looks down ruefully at STARKS' scathed face. STARKS, drenched in BLOOD and SWEAT, seeks the outline of Becker's face in the light. 
STARKS [Whispering] Becker, I know about you. [Beat] I know what you did to your patients. 
BECKER looses the straps around Starks' neck to help him speak. 
STARKS Nathan...Piechowski. [Beat] Jackson MacGregor...Ted Casey. [Beat] You didn't cure them. You killed them. 
BECKER momentarily loses color and his forever cool mien. After some seconds, STARKS passes out and BECKER -- hands trembling -- looks as though he might stick him back in when, instead, he starts to remove him from the Jacket himself. He silently and carefully unties each of the straps -- taking unusual care for Starks' flesh as he prepares to put him on a stretcher. 
INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU, ALPINE GROVE, EARLY MORNING 
As the SUN starts to rise, we see STARKS -- now cleaned up -- recovering in his bed. He is unconscious. From his window, we look down and see Dr. Lorenson's car pulling into the lot... 
FADE TO: 
INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU, ALPINE GROVE, EARLY MORNING 
LORENSON, still wearing her winter gear, walks into Starks' room, anxiously checking his VITALS. Her anxious expression reveals Starks' frailty. She looks to the window then and sees an empty chair with only Becker's SCARF on it. 
LORENSON goes to the window in time to see BECKER getting into his car. 
INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU WARD, ALPINE GROVE, LATER THAT MORNING 
STARKS lies unconscious in the bed. The NURSE, SALLY, stops by the room to check on Dr. Lorenson. 
SALLY Would you like anything, Dr. Lorenson? 
LORENSON A cup of coffee would be great, Sally. Thanks. 
SALLY Is he gonna be ok? 
LORENSON I hope so. 
SALLY Me, too. 
LORENSON looks after her as she leaves. 
INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU WARD, ALPINE GROVE, MORNING, 1992 
LORENSON wakes up as STARKS stirs in his sleep, slowly waking up. 
LORENSON You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you. 
STARKS Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me? 
LORENSON doesn't answer. 
STARKS Can I get some paper and something to write with. 
LORENSON What for? 
LORENSON [Putting the pieces together] He got a little shock. [To himself] And it's reset him. Not permanently probably...but at least for a little while. They use it on epileptic patients sometimes... 
TALIA But he's not epileptic. 
LORENSON No, but he is having seizures. 
TALIA looks at LORENSON. She's still confused. LORENSON's merely surprised. 
INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU UNIT, ALPINE GROVE, 1992 
STARKS looks up from his PAPER -- now covered in WORDS -- to see Dr. Lorenson in the doorway. STARKS still looks weak but much better than before. 
STARKS It worked, didn't it? 
LORENSON nods. 
STARKS This is really happening, isn't it? 
DR. LORENSON [Beat] What do you need me to do? 
STARKS [Beat] Thank you. 
STARKS folds the LETTER. 
STARKS I need to get this letter to someone. 
DR. LORENSON I can't take you out of here in your condition... 
STARKS And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided. 
DR. LORENSON No, it hasn't. 
STARKS Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs. 
EXT. PARKING LOT, ALPINE GROVE, 1992 
LORENSON helps STARKS into the parking lot as it snows. 
INT. LORENSON'S CAR, DAY, 1992 
LORENSON and STARKS are driving on the same, now familiar highway. 
STARKS You know how to get there? 
LORENSON Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough. 
STARKS Good. 
Bob Dylan plays on the RADIO. STARKS smiles as he hears him and turns the music up; the act is sad because, as LORENSON notices, it belongs to someone with an interest to live. 
EXT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992 
DR. LORENSON and STARKS drive up to Jean and Jackie's house. 
LORENSON You want me to come with you? 
STARKS No, I'll be ok. 
STARKS slowly makes his way to their front door and knocks on it as best as he can. The sound, however, is still understandably soft. 
STARKS waits and then reaches for the knob on the door. He opens it and looks inside. We first see his face, and the devastation on it, as we guess the sight he's laid eyes on. 
JACKIE is sitting at the kitchen table, still only 7 years old. Though STARKS expected it, he falters under the disappointment of seeing a girl he liked instead of the woman he loved. As she looks up at him, it's all he can do not to break down. 
STARKS Hi. 
JACKIE [Surprised] Hey. [Beat] I remember you. 
STARKS I remember you, too. 
STARKS shakes his head, looking at her. She looks beautiful, and still hopeful. Her life lays ahead of her and her fate -- when he found her in 2004 -- remains as distant as possible from this innocent, still promising image. 
STARKS Jackie, how have you been? 
JACKIE smiles; she doesn't get asked that often. 
JACKIE I've been ok. 
STARKS Good. How's your mom? 
JACKIE Ok, I guess. 
STARKS nods. JACKIE smiles. It's all he can do not to crumble. 
STARKS Do you think I could see her? She looks at him and senses, like kids do, the desperation in his eyes. 
JACKIE Sure. 
JACKIE calls out for Jean, then runs up the stairs to get her. LORENSON has gotten out of the car and is waiting outside on the porch. STARKS remains in the doorway. 
INT. WARD, ALPINE GROVE, EVENING 
MACKENZIE looks up from his game of solitaire as LORENSON helps STARKS down the hall. He holds up his hand in the gesture of hello, or goodbye. 
STARKS raises his hand back with an earnest smile. 
STARKS I'm telling you my story because it's the only way I can try to help your daughter, and you, have a better one of your own. 
INT. BECKER'S HOME, SHELBOURNE, 1992 
We see BECKER taking his DRUGS. In his dark den, on his worn desk, is a bottle of WHISKEY. He closes his eyes as he administers to himself whatever aid he can... 
INT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, DECEMBER 31, 1992 
JEAN is reading each page avidly, affected by this man's last words. 
STARKS (V.O.) It's scary...and lucky...how much we can forget. Scary because we think the past gives us our bearing, and lucky because in those moments I'm talking about, you realize it doesn't. And it never had to. 
INT. SMALL BAR, CANADA, NIGHT, 1992 
TENNY (Officer Harrison's murderer) is at the bar ordering a drink from the BARTENDER. As he gets his DRINK, he slaps a BILL down on the counter and turns around to survey the bar... 
INT. JACKIE'S ROOM, JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, EVENING, 1992 
JACKIE rummages in a box of her personal belongings, looking for something specific in them. She stops finally when she finds STARKS' DOG TAGS. She takes them out slowly and puts them around her neck. 
STARKS (V.O.) I am not a crazy man, even though they mistook me for one. I live in the same world as the rest of you. Only I saw more of it. 
Then, after a moment of staring down at them, she tucks them under her sweater. 
INT. CAPTAIN MEDLEY'S HOME, NIGHT, 1992 
CAPTAIN MEDLEY holds a beer as he stares blankly at a TV broadcasting news about MIKE TYSON'S RAPE CONVICTION. Medley's barely watching the footage... 
INT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, 1992 
Dr. Lorenson helps Starks back to bed. STARKS looks up at Lorenson, thanking her without words but with his eyes. LORENSON smiles as she looks back sadly at Starks' even more weakened self. 
STARKS (V.O.) And the seeing is the only way you can hear what the truth around you is saying: you can always start believing in things you don't already believing in. And, while you're alive, it's never too late. 
Then he turns and walks out, closing the door so that Starks' room and the screen darken at the same time. 
INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, NEW YEAR'S EVE, 1992 
TWO PAIRS of legs walk down a corridor, darkened by the night, through the now familiar passage to the basement... 
STARKS is not restrained this time though we don't see who is walking down the hall with him. He runs his hand over his forehead and looks at it when he's done. STILL NO CUT. 
They slow down their pace as they round the corner, as STARKS appears dizzier and dizzier. He doesn't stop and the PERSON beside him doesn't see how weak he is... until STARKS TRIPS. 
In slow motion, we hear a DISTANT, GARBLED VOICE CALL OUT... 
DISTORTED VOICE No! Wa...atch out! 
But STARKS' head hits the GLASS CASE of the FIRE EXTINGUISHER on the wall, as it was destined to. In the terrific SHOWER OF GLASS, one PIECE cuts a neat, deep, fatal GASH in Starks' head. 
BLOOD starts to flow. As STARKS' eyes struggle to regain their focus, we see the BLURRED, indiscernible FACE of the PERSON leaning over him to see if he's all right. 
The details start to make sense, even to Starks. This is the WOUND they said he died from. 
INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, NEW YEAR'S EVE, 1992 
STARKS collapses on the familiar slab, ready to be strapped into the Jacket one final time. BLOOD pours from his head onto the floor. 
The PERSON with him struggles to get all of Starks' weight onto the metal slab. She's doing it as carefully, and gently, as she can -- taking observable care with every strap of the JACKET, almost as if the act itself is a humane one. 
When the HANDS finally reach the straps around his neck and the hardest part of the struggle has passed, STARKS smiles kindly, and thankfully, into the single overhead LIGHT in the room that obscures the face of the person strapping him in. 
As the drawer is pushed in, one of the STRAPS gets caught on the side, CUTTING STARKS' ARM. We hear a small CRY in the room. Then the HANDS adjust the strap and slowly push STARKS in. 
INT. JACKET/TUNNEL 
It's more beautiful and serene inside than it's ever been before. This time, as he travels through the tunnel, it's as though he's traveling in a heaven of his own. The IMAGES he sees are the best moments of his past -- connected in a tranquil, fluid narrative that suggest STARKS has finally retrieved his memory without it haunting him... 
STARKS (V.O.) I promise you, Jean. No matter how bad the days and things around you look, they look better awake than they do asleep. I can offer you some proof: when you die, there's only one thing you want to have happen...sometimes so badly it comes true, I guess. [Beat] You want to come back. 
PANELS: 
The PANELS we saw briefly are completed further now. 
1) C.U. A WOMAN'S NECK as a small child's HAND touches it. 
2) INT. STAIRWAY, OLD HOUSE (STARKS' CHILDHOOD HOME): STARKS, 
aged 9, running up the stairs, knocking a PICTURE on the wall with his elbow... 
3) C.U. A black and white PHOTOGRAPH of Starks' father, a much older version of himself. 
4) EXT. CREEK: A shot of clear water that's not to deep and,

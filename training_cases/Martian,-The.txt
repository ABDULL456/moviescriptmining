EXT. SPACE - MARS - TO ESTABLISH 
THE RED PLANET momentarily eclipses the Sun. As sunlight breaks across the edge, warming the surface... 
EXT. MARS - DAY 
We're MOVING THROUGH the channels of Acidalia Planitia to find the ARES 3 HAB SITE. 
LEWIS (OVER RADIO) All right, team. Stay in sight of each other. Let's make NASA proud... 
TITLE: SOL 18 
EXT. MARS - DAY 
CLOSE ON ASTRONAUT MARK WATNEY. He's in the middle of an EVA experiment. He chips at a section of rocks and records his observations on his ARM COMPUTER. 
Bright-eyed and optimistic. Another day at the office. 
MARK In grid section fourteen twenty-eight, the particles appear predominantly "coarse," but as we move to twenty-nine, the particles are much finer, and should be ideal for chem analysis. 
VOICE (OVER RADIO) Hear that, everyone? 
And we FIND RICK MARTINEZ inspecting the MARS ASCENT VEHICLE (a.k.a "The MAV") on the launch pad. They speak over radios. 
MARTINEZ Mark just discovered "dirt." Alert the media. 
MARK What's your job today, Martinez? Confirming the MAV is still upright? 
MARTINEZ Visual inspection of equipment is imperative to mission success. 
Martinez studies the MAV for a moment, then speaks thoughtfully into his arm computer: 
MARTINEZ (CONT'D) "The MAV is still upright." (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
VOICE (RADIO) Watney, you keep leaving your channel open... 
FIND COMMANDER MELISSA LEWIS across the way, overseeing a drill experiment. 
LEWIS Which leads to Martinez responding, which leads to us listening, which leads to me being annoyed. 
MARK Martinez, Commander Lewis would like you please shut your smart mouth. 
VOICE Speaking for the smart people of the world... 
INT. HAB - DAY 
DR. CHRIS BECK studies samples on slides at his station. 
BECK We would prefer you use a different adjective to describe Martinez' mouth. 
EXT. MARS - DAY 
MARTINEZ Did Beck just insult me? 
MARK Doctor Beck. And yes. 
VOICE Happy to turn their radios off from here, Commander... 
INT. HAB - DAY 
BETH JOHANSSEN sits inside at her computer, tracking (among other things) the group's communications. 
JOHANSSEN Just say the word. 
EXT. MARS - DAY 
MARK Johanssen, constant communication is the hallmark of a -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LEWIS Shut `em off. 
Click. Mark and Martinez' radios go SILENT. 
As Lewis works, we see Mark throwing up his arms in the background, like "Hey! C'mon!" 
LEWIS (CONT'D) I apologize for my countrymen, Vogel. 
ALEX VOGEL wears the EUROPEAN UNION patch on his shoulder. 
ALEX Accepted. How many samples do we need, Commander? 
LEWIS Seven. One hundred grams each. Drill at least thirty centimeters down. 
While the two of them use a SPECIMEN DRILL to bore holes in the ground, we see Mark waving his arms in the background: C'mon, turn my radio back on... 
LEWIS Watney, report -- (NO REPLY) WATNEY, REPORT! 
JOHANSSEN BECK He's offline. I don't know -- Commander, before we lost where he is -- telemetry, his decompression alarm went off -- 
LEWIS JOHANSSEN Shit! Johanssen where did -- He was right in front of you last see him? me and then he was gone. He flew off due west -- 
Lewis surveys the scene. Visibility is NEAR ZERO. She can barely see the people next to her. Tries to keep her heart from POUNDING out of her chest. 
LEWIS (CONT'D) Okay... okay... Martinez, get to the MAV and prep for launch. Everyone else, home in on Johanssen. 
JOHANSSEN (STUMBLING) I can't see anything -- 
VOGEL Doctor Beck! How long can a person survive decompression? 
BECK Less than minute. 
LEWIS Line up and walk west. Small steps. He's probably prone. We don't want to step over him. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
The group fights through the chaos -- 
INT. MAV - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
WHOOSH! Martinez dives into the airlock, forces the door closed. Waits for agonizing seconds as it pressurizes... 
Pressurized. Martinez races up the ladder, slides into the pilot's couch and boots the system. 
MARTINEZ Commander -- The MAV's got an 8 degree tilt. It'll tip at 12.3 -- 
EXT. HAB - STORM - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
LEWIS Copy that -- 
Beck checks the readout on his arm computer. 
BECK Johanssen, Watney's bio-monitor sent something before going offline. My computer just says "Bad Packet" -- 
JOHANSSEN It didn't finish transmitting. (works her arm computer) I have the raw packet. It's plaintext: BP 0, PR 0, TP 36.2. 
BECK Copy. (THEN) Blood pressure zero. Pulse rate zero. Temperature normal. 
LEWIS Temperature normal? 
BECK It takes a while for the... it takes a while for the body to cool. 
Everyone stops short as that news lands. 
MARTINEZ (OVER RADIO) Commander. Tilting at 10.5 degrees now, with gusts pushing it to 11. 
LEWIS Copy. If it tips, can you launch before it completely falls over? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARTINEZ (OVER RADIO) (HESITATES) Uh. Yes. Ma'am. I could take manual control. 
LEWIS Copy that. Everyone home in on Martinez' suit. That'll get you to the airlock. Get in and prep for launch. 
VOGEL What about you, Commander? 
LEWIS I'm searching a little more. Get moving. And Martinez, if you start to top, launch. 
MARTINEZ (OVER RADIO) You really think I'm leaving you behind? 
LEWIS I just ordered you to. You three, get to the ship. (as they hesitate) GO. 
INT. MAV - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Vogel, Beck, and Johanssen stumble into the airlock. 
EXT. STORM - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Lewis can't see a thing in any direction. C'mon, think, Melissa, think... 
She reaches into the pack on her back and removes two of the one meter drill bits she was using earlier to take samples. She holds one in each hand, dragging them on the ground as she trudges through the sand. 
LEWIS Johanssen, would the rover IR camera do any good? 
INT. MAV - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
JOHANSSEN (INTO RADIO) Negative. IR can't get through sand any better than visible light. 
They rip off their helmets. Scramble up the ladder. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BECK What's she thinking? She's a geologist. She knows IR can't get through a sandstorm. 
VOGEL She's grasping. For anything. 
MARTINEZ Commander. We're tilting 11.6 degrees. One good gust and we're tipping. 
LEWIS (OVER RADIO) What about the proximity radar? Could it detect Watney's suit? 
MARTINEZ No way. It's made to see Hermes in orbit, not the metal in a single suit. 
LEWIS (OVER RADIO) Copy. Give it a try. 
EXT. MARS - DAY 
Clear skies above the surface of Mars once again. PRELAP the sound of an ALARM: ARRR... ARRR... ARRR... 
A BODY lies facedown, half-covered in red sand at the base of a hill. We catch a glimpse of the nametag on the spacesuit: 
"Watney." 
The OXYGEN ALARM inside the helmet continues to BLARE. And just as it builds to crescendo... 
Mark Watney gasps for air. 
He jerks back into consciousness. He's disoriented, alarms BLARING inside his helmet. As he struggles to move... 
He screams in pain. Glances down. Sees: 
A JAGGED LENGTH OF ANTENNA has pierced his spacesuit and stabbed straight into his abdomen. CAKED BLOOD all around the wound. 
Mark's training kicks in -- the suit is breached -- he struggles to his knees -- gasping in pain -- he reaches to the side of his helmet for the BREACH KIT -- pulls the valve free -- grabs hold of the antenna... grits his teeth... 
AND YANKS the antenna out of his side. The antenna SNAPS FREE -- the suit is exposed to atmosphere -- the pressure inside DROPS -- Mark CRIES OUT, goes woozy -- 
But stays conscious. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
He slams the breach kit over the hole. Seals it. Checks his arm readout. The oxygen stabilizes. He's still alive. 
For now. 
He struggles to his feet. Picks up the length of antenna. Begins the LONG CLIMB up the hill. 
EXT. MARS - HAB - DAY 
We're WITH MARK as he makes the climb, and as he crests the hill we swing around to reveal: 
THE ARES 3 HABITATION (a.k.a. "The Hab"): The large, white tent-like structure where the six crew members lived during their time on Mars. 
It's been battered by the storm, but it's still intact. Mark registers momentary relief. But then his eyes dart over to the MAV LAUNCH SITE. 
It's empty. 
He keeps walking. 
INT. HAB - AIRLOCK - DAY 
Mark fumbles his way into one of the hab's airlocks. As soon as the airlock equalizes, he tears off his helmet... 
INT. HAB - DAY 
Mark stumbles into the main area. Peels off his jumpsuit. WINCES as he rips the blood-caked fabric away from HIS WOUND. 
His fingers probe the puncture. It's deep. That's bad. He checks his back for an exit wound. There's none. That's good. He grabs the broken antenna he brought with him. His fingers trace the bloodied end. It's jagged -- as though a piece of the antenna broke off inside him. 
That's really bad. 
Mark stumbles over to the first-aid station. Grabs supplies. Anesthetic. Syringe. Forceps. Needle. Suture thread. 
(This is not exactly going to be easy to watch.) 
Sweat pouring off his brow, Mark loads up the syringe with anesthetic. Grits his teeth. Injects it into his wound. Gasps. Breathes. Grabs the forceps. Hesitates. I don't want to do this. He takes a deep breath... 
And digs the forceps into his wound. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
He CRIES OUT in pain. Nearly goes unconscious. Fights it. Don't pass out, Mark. He probes with the forceps, grimacing in agony. He can't find it. Pushes the forceps in deeper. And DEEPER. Jesus. Mark's face goes WHITE. 
He finds it. Yanks the forceps free. Sees the small piece of shrapnel. It's out. Hallelujah. 
Mark grabs the needle. Tries to thread it. His hands won't stop shaking. He makes fists. C'mon Mark. Steadies himself just enough. 
He begins to stitch himself up. Bit by agonizing bit. His hands keep shaking, but he refuses to stop until the wound is closed. Finally... 
He's done. He clips the sutures. Collapses back into his chair. Oh Jesus. Tries to catch his breath. 
We slowly ANGLE IN ON MARK as he struggles to breathe... and breathe... 
And as we settle into a CLOSEUP, we see the full reality of Mark's situation hit him. He's in agony. Left for dead. All by himself. 
The only man on the planet. 
His eyes drift to the middle distance. Then... 
MARK Fuck. 
CUT TO TITLE: THE MARTIAN 
INT. HAB - DAY 
CAM ANGLE: we're looking through what (we assume) is a NASA camera. Mark's head peeks into frame. He adjusts the camera, seems unfamiliar with how to work the video journal. 
MARK Okay. Okay... 
He types on the keypad. We see the NASA TIMESTAMP appear on the frame. There, it's working. 
MARK (CONT'D) This is... Mark Watney. Astronaut. I am entering this log for the record, in case I... don't make it. It's... (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MARK (CONT'D) oh-six-fifty-three on Sol 19. And... I'm still alive. (THINKS) Obviously. But I'm guessing this is going to be a surprise to my crewmates. And NASA. And... the world. So... surprise. (THEN) I didn't die on Sol 18. Best I can tell - 
CONTINUED: 
TEDDY You're not the only one who needs satellite time. We've got the Ares 4 supply missions coming up. We should be focusing on the Schiaparelli Crater. 
VINCENT I'm talking about securing us another mission. We have twelve satellites in orbit, we can surely spare a few hours -- 
TEDDY It's not about the satellite time, Vince. 
Vincent shrugs -- then what is it? 
TEDDY (CONT'D) We're a public domain organization. We have to be transparent about this. 
VINCENT And? 
TEDDY The second we point the satellites at the Hab... I broadcast pictures of Mark Watney's dead body to the world. 
VINCENT (DISBELIEF) You're afraid of a PR problem? 
TEDDY Of course I'm afraid of a PR problem. Another mission? Congress won't reimburse us for a paper clip if we put a dead astronaut on the cover of The Washington Post. 
VINCENT So... what do we do? He's not going to decompose. He'll be there forever. 
TEDDY Meteorology estimates he'll be covered in sand from normal weather activity within a year. 
VINCENT We can't wait a year for this. We have work to do. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
TEDDY Ares 5 won't even launch for another five years. We have plenty of time. 
Vincent thinks about it. Frustrated. Tries another tack. 
VINCENT Okay, consider this. Right now, the world is on our side. Sympathy for Watney's family is high... 
He knows this sounds cold, but he's out of options. 
VINCENT (CONT'D) Ares 6 could bring the body back. We don't say that's the purpose of the mission, but we make it clear that would be part of it. We frame it that way, we get more support in Congress. I can sell it. But not if we wait a year. 
Teddy stares back out the window. Vincent has a point. 
VINCENT (CONT'D) In a year, people won't care any more. 
INT. NASA - MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT 
A WOMAN in her twenties checks the work order on her screen. 
TITLE: MINDY PARK, SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS, NASA 
She straightens up when she sees the request comes from "KAPOOR, Vincent." She enters the latitude and longitude... 
MINDY Acidalia Planitia... 
Her heart starts to beat a little faster. Click. The images pop up: overhead shots of the Hab site. Morbid curiosity getting the better of her, she scans for Mark's dead body. Doesn't find it. Hmmm... 
She zooms in on the Hab. That's strange. 
And then it hits her. 
Oh god. 
She doesn't know what to do. It takes her a moment to find the phone. Heart POUNDING. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MINDY (CONT'D) Security? This is Mindy Park in SatCon. I need the emergency contact number for Dr. Kapoor. Yes, him. Yes it's an EMERGENCY -- 
INT. NASA - MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT 
A hard-charging WOMAN stares at us in SHOCK -- 
WOMAN Oh you have GOT to be SHITTING ME -- 
TITLE: ANNIE MONTROSE, Director of Media Relations, NASA 
Annie, Vincent, and Teddy all huddle in the conference room. IMAGES of the HAB site on the screens around them. 
TEDDY How sure? 
VINCENT Nearly 100%. 
ANNIE Do you understand the shitstorm that's about to hit us? 
TEDDY Annie, one thing at a time. (TO VINCENT) Prove it to me. 
VINCENT (points to images) For starters, the solar panels have been cleaned. 
TEDDY They could have been cleaned by wind. 
VINCENT Look at Rover 2. According to the logs, Commander Lewis took it out on Sol 17. Plugged it into the Hab to recharge. It's been moved. 
TEDDY She could have forgotten to log the move. 
VINCENT Here's the clincher. Check the MDV. It's been taken apart. There's no way they do that without telling us. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Mark speaks to the camera. His teeth are chattering. 
MARK Okay, so... success? I've doubled my battery life by scavenging Rover 1. BUT. If I use the heater, it'll eat up half my battery power every day. If I don't use the heater, I will be slowly killed by the laws of thermodynamics. (tries to stop shaking) I'd like to solve this problem, but unfortunately my brain is frozen. 
Mark drives back towards the Hab. 
EXT. MARS - DAY 
Mark drives the Rover across Acidalia Planitia. IN THE DISTANCE: a GREEN FLAG is planted at the top of a hill. 
MARK (V.O.) Good news: I may have a solution to my heating problem. 
Mark climbs the hill. 
MARK (V.O.) Bad news: it involves me digging up the Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Now, if I remember my training correctly, one of the lessons was titled, "Don't Dig Up The Big Box of Plutonium, Mark..." 
Mark begins to dig up the big box of plutonium. 
MARK (V.O.) I get it. RTGs are good for spacecraft, but if they rupture around humans... no more humans. Which is why we buried it when we arrived. And planted that flag so we would never be stupid enough to accidentally go near it again. 
Mark unearths the RTG. It looks like a small missile. 
MARK But. As long as I don't break it... (HESITATES) I almost said "everything will be fine" out loud. My point is... 
INT. ROVER - DAY 
Mark talks to camera while he drives the rover. He's covered in sweat. He even has his shirt off. 
MARK I'm not cold anymore. And yes, I could choose to think about the fact that I'm warm because I have a decaying radioactive isotope riding shotgun next to me, but right now I have bigger problems on my hands. I've scoured every single data file on Commander Lewis' personal drive, and this is officially the LEAST disco song she owns. 
Mark hits play on the computer. "Hot Stuff" by Donna Summer starts playing. It's super disco-y. Mark drives, stone- faced, while it plays. 
EXT. MARS - DAY 
The rover heads towards the Hab in the distance, growing smaller and smaller in frame. Gotta have some HOT LOVE baby this evening... Hot hot hot hot... stuff... 
INT. NASA - PRESS ROOM - DAY 
SATELLITE IMAGERY: from above, Mark's rover cuts across Mars. 
REPORTER 1 Where is Watney going? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
A CNN REPORTER conducts an interview with Vincent in the NASA MEDIA ROOM. Annie watches like a nervous stage mom. 
VINCENT We believe he's preparing for a journey. He's conducting incremental tests -- taking Rover 2 out for longer and longer trips each time. 
REPORTER 2 To what end? Why would he leave the relative safety of the Hab? 
VINCENT Communication. We believe he plans to travel to the Ares 4 launch site in order to make contact with us. But it would be a dangerous gamble. 
REPORTER 3 He'd be risking his life to talk to you? 
VINCENT (NODS) This is the problem Mark faces. He's alone. And he needs to make contact to survive. But if we could talk to him, we'd tell him to stay put. Mark needs to trust we're doing everything in our power to bring him home alive. 
INT. NASA - DAY 
Venkat walks quickly down the halls with Annie... 
ANNIE Don't say "Bring him home alive." It reminds the world he might die. 
VENKAT You think people might forget that? 
ANNIE You asked how you did and I'm giving you my answer. My answer is "Eh." And yes, I'm going to make everyone forget there's a strong likelihood Mark Watney is going to die because that's what you pay me for and unfortunately I need this job because I'm currently paying alimony to two deadbeat ex-husbands because somehow gender equality has bitten me square in the ass. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
VENKAT Hard to believe tha-- 
ANNIE I left them. 
INT. NASA - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Vincent and Annie enter just as the rest of the Department Heads are settling for the meeting. Teddy glances up -- 
TEDDY Don't say "Bring him home alive," Vincent. 
VINCENT You know, these interviews aren't easy. God forbid I try to say something proactive and positive. 
TEDDY Annie... 
ANNIE No more Vincent on television. Copy that. 
Vincent starts to muster an "are you kidding me?" as Mindy passes out a brief to the department heads. 
TEDDY Seventy-six kilometers. Am I reading that right? 
Nobody's quite sure who Teddy is asking. 
MINDY Are you asking me? 
TEDDY I am. 
MINDY Yes, sir. Mark drove straight away from the Hab for almost two hours, did a short EVA, then drove for another two. We think the EVA was to change batteries. 
Vincent rips the poster off the wall. 
TECHNICIAN Hey -- c'mon -- 
VINCENT I'll buy you a new one. (TO MINDY) What's the Hab's location? 
MINDY 31.2 degrees north, 28.5 degrees west. 
Vincent marks it off on the map with a sharpie. Draws Mark's location. He needs a ruler. Looks around, grabs the Technician's notebook out of his hands. Uses the spine to connect the dots. Studies it. Grins. 
VINCENT I know where he's going. 
Vincent, lost in his own world now, bolts for his office. As he hurries away (leaving Mindy and the Technician behind): 
VINCENT (CONT'D) I need to get on an airplane! 
TECHNICIAN Who's he talking to? 
MINDY I'm honestly not sure. 
EXT. MARS - DAY 
Mark's Rover 2 crests a hill, approaching HIS DESTINATION: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
There, buried in a mound of Martian sand, we catch a glint of metal in the sunlight. 
As Mark drives towards it... 
INT. JPL LOBBY - DAY 
Bruce waits in the lobby as Vincent walks through the front doors. 
TITLE: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California 
They shake hands. 
INT/EXT. JPL STORAGE - DAY 
Bruce and Vincent hurry across the JPL campus. In the background, deer frolic. (NOTE: This is real. Deer frolic out in the open on the JPL grounds. NOTE: It's awesome.) 
VINCENT What are the odds Mark can get it working again? 
BRUCE Hard to say. We lost contact in `97. We think it was battery failure. (THEN) Though I'd like to point out it lasted three times longer than expected in any scenario. 
VINCENT Nobody's criticizing JPL's work, Bruce. I want talk to everyone who was here in 
BRUCE They're already waiting for you. 
EXT. MARS - DAY 
Mark, on foot now, digs at the location. As he begins to reveal the buried metal... 
INT. JPL - GARAGE 
Vincent and Bruce enter the cavernous JPL garage. A large crowd mills around an APPARATUS covered by a sheet. 
VINCENT This the replica? 
Bruce nods, pulls off the sheet to reveal... (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
VINCENT (CONT'D) Pathfinder. 
The American spacecraft launched in 1996. It's in two notable sections -- the large LANDER and the smaller SOJOURNER ROVER. 
Vincent's eyes gleam as he stares at the craft. 
EXT. MARS - DAY 
Mark has now uncovered Pathfinder. He stares at it with a similar gleam in his eye. Then he drags the Lander to the back of Rover 2, begins lashing it to a makeshift hitch... 
TITLE: SOL 109 
EXT. HAB - DAY 
Sojourner now sits beside the workbench outside the Hab, watching as Mark methodically takes apart the Lander. 
It looks like he's been at this a while. He removes the battery, replaces it with an environment heater. Like a surgeon performing a heart transplant. 
He locks the heater into place, and as it CLICKS we -- 
CUT TO BLACK.

"HOW ALIVE" 
Mark ponders the question. Begins writing his response. 
INT. JPL GARAGE - NIGHT 
"Impaled by antenna. Bio-monitor destroyed. Crew had reason to think me dead. Not their fault." 
INT. ROVER - NIGHT 
Mark inputs the code into the rover's computer. 
WATNEY (V.O.) Now that we can have more complicated conversations, the smart people at NASA have sent me instructions on how to hack the rover so that it can talk to Pathfinder. If I hack a tiny bit of code, just twenty instructions in the Rover's operating system, NASA can link the rover to Pathfinder's broadcasting frequency... and we're in business. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Mark waits patiently at the computer. 
Text pops up on Mark's screen. As he reads: 
VENKAT (V.O.) "Mark, this is Vincent Kapoor... 
INT. JPL - GARAGE - NIGHT 
Vincent and Bruce huddle around Tim's console while Vincent dictates and Tim types. 
VINCENT We've been watching you since Sol 54... 
INT. NASA - MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT 
Teddy, Mitch, Annie, and the rest of the team watch Vincent's text cross the screen. 
VINCENT (V.O.) "The whole world is rooting for you. Amazing job, getting Pathfinder. We're working on rescue plans. Meantime..." 
INT. ROVER - NIGHT 
Mark reads the text. His first human contact in quite some time. 
VINCENT (V.O.) "We're putting together a supply mission to keep you fed until Ares 4 arrives." 
INT. JPL GARAGE - NIGHT 
Vincent and Bruce huddle around Tim's console. 
TIM (READING) "Glad to hear it. Really looking forward to not dying." 
Everyone laughs, cheers. Tim notices there's more... 
TIM (CONT'D) "How's the crew? What did they say when they found out I was alive?" 
Vincent and Bruce share a glance. Vincent thinks about it. 
BRUCE Tell him. Hm. Tell him... 
INT. ROVER - NIGHT 
Mark watches the text pop up onscreen: 
VINCENT (V.O.) "We haven't told the crew you're alive yet. We need them to concentrate on the mission." 
INT. JPL GARAGE - NIGHT 
The whole room waits patiently. Tim reads the response. 
TIM He says... "They don't know I'm alive? WHAT THE--" (HESITATES) "What the... f-word... f-word in gerund form... f-word again... is wrong with you... f-words." 
VINCENT Mark, please watch your language... 
INT. ROVER - NIGHT 
Mark reads the response. 
VINCENT (V.O.) Everything you type is being broadcast live all over the world. 
Mark's eyes narrow as he types his response. Hits ENTER. 
INT. JPL GARAGE - NIGHT 
The group reads Mark's response. They go PALE. Oh, Jesus. Vincent hangs his head. Tim tries not to smile and fails. 
INT. NASA - TEDDY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Teddy is on the phone as Mitch approaches. 
TEDDY (INTO PHONE) Yes sir... he's under a tremendous amount of stress... I understand. We're working on it. Thank you, sir. 
Teddy hangs up. Glances at Mitch. 
TEDDY (CONT'D) I just had to explain to the President of the United States what a "bureaucratic felcher" is. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MITCH I made the mistake of typing it into Google. (off Teddy's look) Don't. (THEN) Problem is, Mark's right. This is only gonna get worse the longer we wait. We need to tell the crew. 
TEDDY You're bringing this up while Vincent's in Pasadena so he can't argue the other side. 
MITCH I shouldn't have to clear this with you or Vincent or anyone else. (THEN) It's time, Teddy. 
Teddy thinks about it. 
VINCENT Complete loss of pressure boiled off most of the water. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: VINCENT (CONT'D) Any bacteria that survived, died in the sub-zero temperatures when exposed to Mars' atmosphere. 
ANNIE How long does he have? 
VINCENT He can still eat the potatoes he has, he just can't grow any more. We estimate they'll give him about 200 sols. 
TEDDY And rations get him to what? Sol 409? 
VINCENT (NODS) So with potatoes he can stretch to 609. 
ANNIE By Sol 868 he'll be long dead. 
TEDDY We're gonna have to launch as soon as possible. Which changes our travel time. 
MITCH We're working on it. Prelim estimates call for a four-hundred fourteen day trip. 
TEDDY (DOES MATH) It's Sol 135 now. We need thirteen days to mount the boosters and perform inspections. Which gives Bruce and his team... (FUCK) Forty-seven days to make this probe. 
ANNIE How long does it normally take? 
VINCENT Six months. Minimum. 
TEDDY I'm gonna let you call Bruce and give him the news. 
INT. JPL BULLPEN - NIGHT 
Bruce and his team sit around a speakerphone. They've just hung up with Vincent. Everyone looks suitably SHELLSHOCKED. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BRUCE Okay. (LONG PAUSE) Okay. 
Everyone is at a loss for words. You might as well have told this team they have to build a unicorn. 
BRUCE (CONT'D) I'm, uh... I'm gonna need a change of clothes. We're all gonna need a change of clothes. 
EXT. HERMES - SPACE 
The Hermes continues on its course back to Earth. 
TITLE: SOL 136 
MARTINEZ (PRELAP) "Dear Mark..." 
INT. HERMES REC ROOM - SPACE 
Martinez types at his terminal. 
MARTINEZ (V.O.) "Apparently, NASA's letting us talk to you now, and I drew the short straw. Sorry we left you behind on Mars, but we don't like you." 
INT. ROVER - NIGHT 
Mark reads his email. 
MARTINEZ (V.O.) "Also, it's a lot roomier on the Hermes without you. We have to take turns doing your tasks, but it's only botany (not real science.) How's Mars?" 
Mark types his response. 
MARK (V.O.) "Dear Martinez, Mars is fine. I accidentally blew up the Hab, but unfortunately all of Commander Lewis' disco music still survived." 
INT. HERMES REC ROOM - SPACE 
Martinez reads Mark's response. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARTINEZ "How's the Hermes? Cramped and claustrophobic? Every day I go outside and look at the vast horizons just because I can." (THEN) "Tell the others I said hello." 
Martinez types. We see his response on his screen: 
"Will do." 
EXT. HAB - DAY 
Back to work. No choice. Mark clears the detritus from inside the Hab. Stares at the hole in the airlock. 
INT./EXT. HAB - DAY 
Mark covers the hole with Hab canvas. Begins strapping it in place with duct tape. Doubles up the tape in a circular pattern. Studies his work. It's not pretty, but with a little luck... 
Mark repressurizes the Hab. Watches the canvas stretch as the pressure equalizes. He holds his breath... 
The canvas holds. 
INT. HAB - NIGHT 
Mark takes inventory of his remaining potatoes. Outside, gusts of wind slam the canvas. 
Mark tries to stay focused on the matter at hand. Tries not to think about the fact that his life is currently held together by duct tape. 
Keep working, Mark... 
INT. JPL - RICH'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
A man sleeps in his office, half-on and half-off his small love seat. He snores ever-so-slightly. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
TEDDY It's on me, Vincent. (TO BRUCE) You've got your two weeks. Get it done. 
INT. HAB - DAY 
Mark sits at the table. A ration pack and two potatoes in front of him. He talks to camera. He looks depressed. 
TITLE: SOL 154 
MARK So. I have to hold out until the probe gets here with more food. And this is what "minimal calorie count" looks like. (holds up the pack) Standard issue ration. But instead of three every one day, I'm now eating one every three days. (OPENS PACK) Oh good. Meatloaf. 
He divides the meatloaf into thirds. Sets the majority aside. Focuses on what's left. Which is pathetic. 
MARK (CONT'D) This is today's allotment. Which I will supplement with potatoes. Which I am beginning to hate with the fiery passion of a thousand suns. And now I've been told to do this. 
Mark hacks off even more of the meager ration and half of a potato and sets that aside. There's barely anything left. 
MARK (CONT'D) The point is, "Stretch the rations four more days" is a real dick-punch. 
There are also two pills on the table. Mark crushes them. 
MARK (CONT'D) I'm dipping this potato in Vicodin and there's nothing anyone can do about it. 
EXT. CAPE CANAVERAL - DAY 
The IRIS PROBE, now mounted on the booster, is readied for launch. WATER VAPOR clouds the launchpad. 
The final SUPPLIES are loaded into the probe. 
INT. NASA - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 
Full house. Mitch presides over the room, in his element. 
MITCH Do you believe in God, Vincent? 
VINCENT Several. My mother's Catholic and my father's Hindu. 
MITCH We'll take all the help we can get. 
Mitch puts on his headset. 
MITCH (CONT'D) This is the Flight Director. Begin Launch Status Check. 
LAUNCH CONTROL (OVER COMMS) Roger that, Houston... 
And as Mitch runs through the status check... 
INT. NASA - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 
Teddy watches the countdown clock from the observation room. He looks over what appears to be a SPEECH. We catch a few words, including, "...successful launch..." 
Teddy closes the speech in a BLUE FOLDER. As the clock approaches 00:00:15.... 
MITCH (ON THE FLOOR) This is Flight. We are go for launch on schedule.

TEDDY (ONSCREEN) Yes. 
We hear a MAN'S VOICE. He speaks in SUBTITLED CHINESE. 
VOICE Their astronaut is going to die. 
Reveal A MAN AND A WOMAN watching the monitor. The voice BELONGS TO: 
TITLE: ZHU TAO, Under-Director, CNSA 
ZHU Perhaps. Perhaps not. (hands Guo the brief) The Taiyang Shen's booster. Our engineers have run the numbers, and it has enough fuel for a Mars injection orbit. 
TITLE: GUO MING, Director, CNSA 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GUO (are you kidding?) Why hasn't NASA approached us? 
ZHU They don't know. Our booster technology is classified. 
GUO So if we do nothing... 
ZHU The world would never know we could have helped. 
GUO Then. Merely for the sake of argument, let's say we decide to help them... 
ZHU We'd be giving up a booster and effectively cancelling Taiyang Shen. 
GUO considers this. But he's already made the decision... 
GUO We need to keep this among scientists. A cooperation between space agencies... 
INT. NASA - TEDDY'S OFFICE - DAY 
We're SLOWLY PUSHING IN on Teddy as he listens to the voice on the other end of the phone detail the terms. 
Teddy closes his eyes. Relief washes over him. It takes him a moment to realize they're waiting for his answer. 
TEDDY Yes. 
INT. JPL - BULLPEN - DAY 
Bruce stands at the white boards, addressing his department heads. He's energized, writing like a madman while he talks:

INT. NASA - SUPER COMPUTER ROOM - DAY 
Rich Purnell stares at the calculations on the screen. Can these be right? He runs the numbers again. As he sees the readout on his screen, he grins: holy shit, I'm right.

Rich hurries through the halls. 
INT. NASA - VINCENT'S OFFICE - DAY 
Vincent's on the phone. 
VINCENT We're jettisoning any sort of landing system -- the idea is we're only sending rations, so they can crash land on Mars... 
SECRETARY WAIT -- 
Rich barges into to Vincent's office. 
RICH You should hang up the phone. 
VINCENT I'm sorry -- who are you? 
RICH My name is Rich Purnell and I work in astrodynamics and you should hang up the phone right now. 
VINCENT (INTO PHONE) I'll call you back. 
Rich hands Vincent his summary. 
INT. NASA - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
We're FOLLOWING ANNIE as she hurries into the briefing room. Vincent, Rich, Bruce, and Mitch are already there. Annie's reading the email on her phone. 
ANNIE What the hell is "Project Elrond?" 
VINCENT I had to make something up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ANNIE "Elrond?" 
MITCH (REALIZING) Because it's a secret meeting. 
ANNIE How do you know that? Why does "Elrond" mean "secret meeting?" 
BRUCE The Council of Elrond. From Lord of the Rings. It's the meeting where they decide to destroy the One Ring. 
ANNIE I so quit right now. 
TEDDY (ENTERING) If we're calling something Project Elrond, I would like my codename to be "Glorfindel." 
MITCH Let them make that decision. 
TEDDY Mitch. We're going with option one. 
Mitch stares at Teddy. Quietly seething. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (5) 
MITCH You goddamn coward. 
EXT. HAB - DAY/DUSK 
Mark trudges out of the airlock, goes about his routine. He walks over to the solar panels, starts to scrub them for (what seems like) the thousandth time... 
And stops. 
He can't do it anymore. He stares at them for a long time. Then drops the brush. 
He walks to the top of the hill. Sits down. 
He closes his eyes. 
CUT TO: 
Later. Mark hasn't moved. The sun is beginning to set. The temperature ALARM on his suit is beginning to BLARE. It gets cold FAST on Mars. 
Mark overrides the alarm. Sits in the silence. As he glances back towards the setting sun, something METALLIC glints in the dust beneath him. 
Hmm. Mark gets up. Walks towards it. It's Vogel's specimen drill. Dropped when the storm hit. Mark looks around, sees the HOLES drilled in the rock formation. 
His fingers trace the unfinished work. 
He picks up the drill. 
INT. NASA - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 
SATELLITE VIEW: We can see Mark making his way to the Rover. 
MINDY He's been doing EVAs throughout the day. 
Vincent is hovering over Mindy's station. 
MINDY (CONT'D) There's a pattern to them. He goes out three hundred meters. Then stops. Three hundred more meters. Then stops. 
VINCENT And nobody gave him instructions? Did JPL schedule something? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Mindy shakes her head. 
MINDY He's at the Rover. (THEN) We're receiving a transmission. 
She pulls it up on the screen. Frowns. It's a jumble of numbers and data. 
MINDY (CONT'D) "Chem analysis... sample batch 1A-7C..." 
Vincent's the first to figure it out. 
VINCENT Commander Lewis' geo-compositing experiments. 
Mindy frowns. I'm sorry, what? 
Vincent looks at the screens. Admiration in his eyes. 
VINCENT (CONT'D) He's finishing the mission. 
INT. HAB - NIGHT 
Mark addresses camera while he works at the experiment table, diligently crushing the rock samples and testing them with his chemistry set. Still somber. But he's working. 
MARK We evac'd eighteen sols into a thirty-one sol mission... Which means we've got thirteen sols of experiment and research schedules. For each of us. So. Commander Lewis... your work's in good hands. Beck -- I'll be honest with you, I don't understand chemolithotrophic detection. At all. But I'm doing my best. Johanssen, I know you don't like it when I touch the ChemCam, but guess what? I'm touching the ChemCam. Vogel, I think I've got a new cataloguing system for the core samples that I've titled "Das Core Samples" out of respect for the Fatherland. And Martinez... I still don't know what it is you do. Why did we bring you? No idea. (THEN) I'm trying to keep everything documented and organized. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MARK (CONT'D) I know that's not exactly my strong suit, but I want it all to make sense, in case... you know. Maybe you can teach it in class someday. The Watney Syllabus. "How to Make a Bathtub Using NASA Tubing and an Old RTG." "How to Cook a Potato Six-Thousand Different Ways." "How to Make Water Out of Rocket Fuel. To Keep You Alive. For Just A Little Longer." 
INT. HERMES - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE 
From his computer, Vogel runs a diagnostic check on the ship's engines. As he finishes his work for the day, he turns his attention to his Email. Frowns when he sees: 
"Subject: Unsere Kinder" 
Our children? That's strange. He tries to open the attachment, but it's unreadable. 
INT. HERMES GYM - SPACE 
Vogel glides along passage to the Rec Room. Johannsen jogs within the rotating drum. Vogel approaches. 
VOGEL I have a problem. 
INT. HERMES GYM - SPACE 
Johanssen leads Vogel into the gym. 
VOGEL It's an email from my wife. The subject line says "Our Children," but the computer won't open the attachment. 
JOHANSSEN Let's take a look. (as she works) Huh. This isn't a jpg. It's a plain ASCII text file. Looks like... I don't know what this looks like. Math equations. Does this make any sense to you? 
BRENDAN What? Who the hell is Rich Purnell? 
ALARMS start ringing out on the various stations. 
GUIDANCE Flight, Guidance. 
BRENDAN Go Guidance. 
GUIDANCE Hermes is off-course. 
BRENDAN CAPCOM, advise Hermes they're drifting. Guidance, get a correction ready --

INT. NASA - TEDDY'S OFFICE - DAWN 
Teddy's staring out the window when Mitch enters. Teddy makes him wait. 
TEDDY Annie will go before the media this morning and inform them of NASA's decision to reroute the Hermes to Mars. 
MITCH That seems like the smart move. Considering the circumstances. 
TEDDY You may have killed the whole crew. 
MITCH Whoever gave them the maneuver only passed along information. The crew made the decision on their own. 
Teddy looks at him. Don't give me that horseshit. 
TEDDY We're fighting the same war. Every time something goes wrong, the world forgets why we fly. I'm trying to keep us airborne. This is bigger than one person. 
MITCH No. It's not. 
Teddy relents. Just slightly. God, I hope you're right. THEN: 
TEDDY When this is over... I'll expect your resignation. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MITCH (a beat; then) I understand. 
TEDDY (we're finished here) Bring our astronauts home. 
EXT. MARS 
Beneath us, sunlight creeps across the ridges of the Schiaparelli Crater. We PRELAP the sound of DRILLING. 
TITLE: SOL 219 
MARK (PRELAP) Every Ares mission requires three years of presupplies... 
INT. HAB - DAY 
Mark talks directly to the camera. 
MARK (CONT'D) ...so NASA figured out it's a lot easier to ship some of this stuff ahead of time rather than bring it with us. So, as a result, the MAV for Ares-4 is already waiting at the Schiaparelli Crater. And the plan is to use it to launch me into orbit just as the Hermes is passing. And then, I guess... they catch me? In space. 
Mark thinks about that. Grins. Okay, I guess that sounds awesome. 
MARK (CONT'D) Anyway, that's not really my problem right now. First, I have to get there. And it's 3,200 kilometers away. So I have 200 sols to figure out how to bring everything here that's keeping me alive -- the Atmospheric Regulator, the Oxygenator, and the Water Reclaimer -- along for the ride. Luckily, I have the brainpower of the entire planet Earth helping me with this endeavor. So far we've come up with, "Drill holes in the roof of your rover and then hit it with a rock." (THEN) We'll get there. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MUSIC UP: The opening CHORDS of "Starman" by David Bowie take us to... 
EXT. HAB - DAY 
Mark, in his MAV SUIT, stands on top of Rover Two. He holds the large ROCK SAMPLE DRILL like a jackhammer, drilling holes through the roof. It's grueling work. 
He's been at this a while: we catch a glimpse of the SEVEN- HUNDRED HOLES he's drilled around the edge of the roof. 
He finishes the last hole. Then he grabs a SCREWDRIVER. And a ROCK. Jams the screwdriver between the holes like a chisel. WHACK! He hits it with the rock. 
WHACK! He hits it again. And again. 
EXT. MARS - DAY - BEGIN MONTAGE 
"Didn't know what time it was the lights were low, oh, oh..." 
Mark positions the partially-disassembled rover in front of the camera. Frames his handiwork. Waits.

The Hermes, rotating once again, soars through space on its return journey to Mars. It leaves the Earth behind... 
And the music slowly FADES OUT. 
EXT. MARS 
As we hold in silence on the Red Planet, the title takes a little longer than usual to appear onscreen.... 
TITLE: SOL 461 
MARK (PRELAP) I've been thinking about laws on Mars... 
EXT. HAB - DAY 
And it's OVER SIX MONTHS LATER, so a lot has changed. 
MARK (PRELAP) There's an international treaty saying no country can lay claim to anything that's not on Earth. 
Both Rovers are now hitched together. Pathfinder rides on top of Rover 1 like Granny Clampett. Rover 2 houses all the equipment. The whole thing looks like a Gypsy caravan made of billion dollar NASA equipment. 
MARK (PRELAP) (CONT'D) And by another treaty, if you're not in any country's territory, maritime law applies. So Mars is "international waters." 
INT. HAB - DAY 
The Hab is similarly transformed. All the major equipment has been stripped for parts. Sections of the canvas have been cut down, re-glued, making the tent lopsided in places. 
MARK (PRELAP) NASA is an American non-military organization, and it owns the Hab. So, as soon as I step outside, I'm in international waters. 
INT. HAB - DAY 
Mark talks directly to camera. The six months have transformed him as well. He's GAUNT. His hair is longer. His impressive beard shapes his face. 
MARK Here's the cool part. I leave this morning for the Schiaparelli crater, where I will commandeer the Ares 4 lander. Nobody explicitly gave me permission to do this, and they can't until I'm aboard the Ares 4. So I will take control of a craft in international waters without permission. Which, by definition, makes me a pirate. (THEN) Mark Watney, Space Pirate. 
It's better than winning the Nobel Prize. 
INT. HAB - DAY 
Last day in the Hab. Mark shaves his beard. CUT TO: 
Mark organizes the boxes and boxes of experiments he was keeping alive during his time in the Hab. Among the labels we see "Das Soil Samples." CUT TO: 
Mark pulls on his suit. Performs final shutdown. All the computers, lights, heaters go DARK. Silence.

Mark depressurizes the Hab. Stares at it for a moment. Thank you for keeping me alive. 
EXT. ROVER - DAY 
Mark opens Rover 2. We catch a glimpse inside: it's filled with frozen potatoes and scavenged equipment. 
(CONTINUED)

MARK (V.O.) Step outside the rover? First guy to be there. Climb that hill? First guy to do that. 
Mark takes careful note of one of the Martian moons (PHOBOS) in the sky. Finds his course.

INT. ROVER - ARES 4 MAV SITE - DAY 
TITLE: SOL 538 
Mark stares at the camera with a look that says, "Oh jesus these JPL guys are gonna get me killed." 
MARK (DISTRAUGHT) I know what they're doing. I know what they're doing. They keep repeating "accelerate faster than any man in the history of space travel" like this is a good thing, like this'll distract me from how insane their plan is. Oh really? I get to be the fastest man in the history of space travel? You're launching me into space in a convertible. No no, it's worse, because I don't have any controls. You're launching me into space in a tin can. And, by the way, physicists don't even use words like "fast" when describing acceleration, so they're only doing it in hopes I won't raise any objections because I like the way "fastest man in the history of space travel" sounds. Well, you know what? (MORE) (CONTINUED)

Martinez reboots the simulator... 
INT. MAV COCKPIT - DAY

MARK Yeah. The canvas didn't hold... 
INT. HERMES - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE 
MARK (OVER COMMS) I think it ripped early in the ascent. 
LEWIS That's consistent with what we saw. 
MARK (OVER COMMS) How bad is it, Commander? 
LEWIS We've corrected the intercept range, but we've got a problem with the intercept velocity. 
MARK (OVER COMMS) How big a problem? 
LEWIS 42 meters per second. 
INT. MAV - DAY 
We're CLOSE ON MARK as that news lands. 
MARK Well. Shit. 
INT. HERMES - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE 
Everyone struggles to find a solution. Mark's voice interrupts the silence: 
MARK (OVER COMMS) Commander? 
INT. MAV - DAY 
LEWIS (OVER COMMS) Go ahead, Mark. 
MARK I could find something sharp in here and poke a hole in the glove of my EVA suit. I could use the escaping air as a thruster and fly my way to you. Since the source is on my arm, I could direct it pretty easy. 
INT. HERMES - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE 
LEWIS I can't see you having any control if you did that. You'd be eyeballing the intercept and using a thrust vector you can barely control. 
MARK (OVER COMMS) Those are very good points. But. CONSIDER THIS: 
INT. MAV - DAY 
MARK I would get to fly around like Iron Man. 
INT. HERMES - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE 
LEWIS We should have left him on Mars. 
MARK (OVER COMMS) Iron Man, Commander. Iron Man. 
Lewis rubs her face. Thinks. Hmm... 
LEWIS Maybe it's not the worst idea. 
MARTINEZ No, it actually is. The worst idea. Ever. 
LEWIS Not his part. But using atmosphere as thrust... (springs into action) Martinez, get Vogel's station up and running... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARTINEZ It's up. What do you need? 
LEWIS I need to know what happens if we blow the VAL. 
Both Martinez and Johanssen straighten up. What? 
MARTINEZ You want to open the Vehicular Airlock? 
LEWIS It would give us a good kick. 
MARTINEZ Yeah. And it might blow the nose of the ship off in the process. 
JOHANSSEN And... all the air would leave. And we need air. To not die. 
LEWIS We'll seal the bridge and reactor room. We let everywhere else go vacuo. 
MARTINEZ But we'd still have the same problem as Watney. We can't direct the thrust. 
LEWIS We don't have to. The VAL is in the nose. We just point the ship at Mark. 
MARTINEZ (reading the numbers) A breach at the VAL would decelerate us 29 meters per second. 
JOHANSSEN Which gives us a relative velocity of 13 meters per second. 
LEWIS Beck -- you hearing this? 
INT. HERMES - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE 
MARTINEZ How do we open the airlock doors? There's no way to open them remotely, and if anyone's nearby when it blows... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LEWIS Right... right... (THINKS) Vogel? 
VOGEL (OVER COMMS) Go ahead, Commander. 
MARTINEZ Guys, I'm running the numbers -- even with optimal VAL blow, we're gonna be off on our angle. 
LEWIS What's the new intercept distance? (IMPATIENT) Johanssen. 
JOHANSSEN 260 meters. Approximate. 
LEWIS That's too far... 
She thinks for a moment. Then she races off the flight deck. 
MARTINEZ Commander? 
EXT. HERMES - SPACE 
Beck climbs out of Airlock 1, and makes his way along the hull of Hermes, using the handholds. We FOLLOW HIM as he traverses the ship, and as he makes his way into Airlock 2...

EXT./INT. AIRLOCK - DAY 
LEWIS guides MARK towards the airlock with her MMU. 
LEWIS (INTO COMMS) Beck, prep the sick bay. We're bringing him to you. Everyone else, meet me in Airlock Two. 
MARTINEZ, JOHANSSEN, and VOGEL race down from the bridge to meet them. They're not in suits -- they have to wait for the outer airlock to close. THROUGH THE OBSERVATION WINDOWS: they see Lewis and Mark touch down in the airlock. 
The outer airlock closes -- WHOOSH -- Mark collapses, exhausted. The inner airlock opens. Martinez, Johanssen, and Vogel race into the room, grab Mark. Supporting him. Holding him. 
MARK Hi guys. 
Everyone fighting back tears. 
JOHANSSEN Oh, hey Mark. Haven't seen you in a while. 
MARTINEZ Yeah. What've you been up to?

EXT. EARTH - TO ESTABLISH 
Home. It's never looked more warm and welcoming. 
EXT. PARK - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY 
A man sits by himself on a bench. 
ANGLE to reveal it's MARK WATNEY. Basking in the warmth of a beautiful day. 
TITLE: DAY 1 
INT. NASA - TEACHING THEATER - DAY 
The young, fresh-faced recruits in NASA's Astronaut Candidate Program are abuzz as Mark enters the room. The students nudge each other -- Look, there he is. 
By the time Mark reaches the lectern at the front, he has the full attention of the class. 
MARK Welcome to the Astronaut Candidate Program. Pay attention. This could save your life. (THEN) Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. 
The class laughs. 
MARK (CONT'D) Okay, let's see if I can get some of your questions out of the way up front. Yes, I did, indeed, survive on a deserted planet by farming in my own shit. It was even more disgusting than it sounds. Let's never speak of it again. 
More laughter. Mark lets it subside. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARK (CONT'D) Question Two: "When you were stranded and alone up there... did you think you were gonna die?" 
And there's a pause as Mark thinks about it. The rare moment of reflection for our hero. 
He nods. Genuine: 
MARK (CONT'D) Yes. 
Then... 
MARK (CONT'D) And it'll happen to you, too. You should know that going in. It's space. It's filled with chance, circumstance, and bad luck. It doesn't cooperate. At some point, I promise, at some point every single thing is gonna go south on you, and you'll think: this is it. This is how I end. (THEN) And you can either accept that... or you can get to work. 
He lets those words land. 
MARK (CONT'D) That's all it is. You simply begin. Solve one problem. Then the next one, then the next. (THEN) You solve enough problems... and you get to come home. 
Mark opens his notebook. 
MARK (CONT'D) All right. Questions? 
Every hand in the class shoots into the air. 
MUSIC UP: "LOVE TRAIN" by The O'Jays carries us to...

A SPACECRAFT is readied for launch.

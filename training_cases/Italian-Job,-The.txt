Based on the 1969 screenplay by 
Troy Kennedy-Martin 
December 21, 2001 
FADE IN: 
EXT. THE PORT OF GENOA, ITALY - NIGHT 
Forklifts RUMBLE. Workers WIPE FRAME. All the bustle and cacophony of a major seaport. 
We FIND ourselves focusing on ONE LARGE CRATE. With the GRINDING of gears, a crane lifts it off the dock and carries it onto a ship. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME 
Through night-vision binoculars, CHARLIE CROKER, 28, watches the mysterious crate. Charlie is young to run his own crew but he's a born leader. 
CHARLIE Lyle? 
SWISH PAN TO: LYLE, 21, brilliant and punctilious, fingering the keyboard of his strap-on supercharged laptop. 
LYLE I've got the orbital data and SV clock corrections for each satellite that gets the signal. That'll make my reading as solid as the Precise Positioning Service that only the D.O.D. can use. We're talkin' 100 meter horizontal accuracy, 156 meter vertical accuracy, .340 nanoseconds time accuracy. 
SWISH PAN TO: STEVE, 30, bearded. Steve has an arrogant confidence mixed with the hint of a smile. 
STEVE Why can't he talk like a person? 
CHARLIE ...Because he's not. 
LYLE I do need one more thing, Charlie. 
CHARLIE What's that? 
LYLE Someone to turn the goddamn homing device on. No signal, no score. 
CHARLIE (to Steve) Where're the Italians? 
STEVE Patience. 
INT. HUMVEE (MOVING) - SAME TIME 
The driver is HANDSOME ROB, 30. Riding shotgun is HALF-EAR, 35, immersed in a book: Albert Einstein Creator & Rebel. 
Half-Ear is a large black man with a Southern accent and a hearing aid. 
HANDSOME ROB What's that shit? 
HALF-EAR A book. It's called reading. You should try it some time. 
Handsome Rob holds up three fingers. 
HANDSOME ROB You wanna read something. Read between the lines. 
HALF-EAR Well here's something even you can relate to. Albert got a lotta trim. That genius thing is a babe magnet. 
HANDSOME ROB Lemme see that book. 
INT. HOTEL JEWELRY SHOP - SAME TIME 
The final member of the crew, JOHN BRIDGER, 50s, is a tasteful man buying a very tasteful, and very expensive, diamond necklace. The saleswoman wraps it up as he dials a number on his cell phone. 
STELLA (V.O.) Hello? 
JOHN BRIDGER Hi, sweetie. 
INT. STELLA'S CONDO - PHILADELPHIA - INTERCUT 
STELLA BRIDGER, 27, crushingly attractive, has just stepped out of the shower, hair still wet, body wrapped in a towel. 
STELLA Daddy. How are you? 
JOHN BRIDGER I'm sending you something. 
STELLA Really? Does it smell nice? 
JOHN BRIDGER No. But it's sparkly. 
Hearing this, Steve looks a little jealous. 
JOHN BRIDGER Shit, you made thirty million dollars in gold drop out of sight without holding a gun. Who else could've pulled that off? 
CHARLIE You could've. I had big shoes to fill. 
JOHN BRIDGER Fill the shoes but don't follow the footprints. 
CHARLIE What're you talking about? You've lived the life. 
JOHN BRIDGER My life's been nothing but fake IDs, fake business cards and divorce papers. This is the only thing that's real. 
Bridger shows him a photograph of Stella that he keeps in his wallet. 
CHARLIE Stella's a beautiful girl. 
JOHN BRIDGER She's amazing. And I spent half her childhood in prison. This is a once in a lifetime haul, Charlie. Bring down the curtain after this one. Make a new life. Find someone amazing and be there for her. 
As the advice escapes Bridger's mouth -- 
EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD 
A Jeep thunders out of a hiding place in the trees and blocks the road. The Humvee brakes to avoid running into it. 
HANDSOME ROB Shit. 
Click. That's the sound of a gun cocking as it's pressed against Handsome Rob's temple. 
STEVE Anyone acts stupid and his brains go on the windshield. 
They see the two Italian Inspectors jump out of the Jeep, AK- 47s leveled at the crew. Steve has double-crossed them. 
ON THE CREW: shocked would be a good place to start. 
CHARLIE What the hell do you think you're doing? 
STEVE Sorry Charlie. But I want the box of Cracker Jack all to myself. 
The Italians pull the crates of gold out of the back of the Humvee. 
CHARLIE You're not thinking this through. It's a stupid move. 
STEVE Think so? Well you're the brilliant one. The Master Planner. Isn't that so, John? 
Steve climbs out of the Humvee, gun still on Handsome Rob, the AK-47s aimed at the others. 
STEVE You bet on the wrong horse. 
JOHN BRIDGER We'll hunt you down. You're gonna regret this. 
EXT. HUMVEE 
Safely outside, Steve turns his gun on Bridger. 
STEVE No regrets, Dixie cup. 
BOOM. He shoots Bridger in the head. Just like that. 
The Italians follow suit, AK-47s SCREAMING out bursts of full automatic fire at the crew. 
INT. HUMVEE 
They duck for cover as the vehicle is riddled with gunfire. 
Glass shatters. Bullets ricochet. They're in the epicenter of hell. 
Handsome Rob jerks the steering wheel and stomps the gas. 
Driving blind. 
EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD 
The Humvee hits the side of the Jeep, grinds alongside it, metal tearing against metal. 
The Humvee's right side tires precariously hover by the cliff and the raging water below. 
The gunners keep FIRING. Bullets rip into the Humvee's tires. 
EXT. HUMVEE 
It almost escapes, but it can't make it on shredded rubber. 
It careens off the road and -- 
A car RISES INTO FRAME on a bustling street: a 1960 Mini Cooper S., a worldwide motoring icon. Its shape crouches low to the ground and its tiny 10-inch wheel-at-each-corner gives it the legendary Mini look. 
If when you see its headlights and classic grille it doesn't bring a smile to your face, then you've got no automobile soul. 
INT. MINI (CRUISING) - DAY 
Stella takes on the road like someone who loves to be behind the wheel of a car that claimed victory in the Monte Carlo Rally three times. She passes a minivan, a breeze with the Mini's quick, go-kart-like handling. 
She searches for a parking space on a street lined with SUVs. 
Sees a spot, it's not really a space, just a gap between two gas guzzlers, there's no way any car could squeeze in. 
Brake. Shift. Hard turn. She parallel parks the Mini with ease. She's right in front of -- 
HER SHOP 
Antique keys and locks dominate the storefront window with the name of the shop stenciled across the glass: BRIDGER LOCK AND SAFE COMPANY. Stella hops out of the Mini. With a poised walk she heads inside. 
INT. SHOP - DAY 
It is filled with old cast-iron safes she has rebuilt along with some new models. Stella's RECEPTIONIST greets her. 
RECEPTIONIST How long? 
STELLA Four minutes, forty-three seconds. 
High-five. 
RECEPTIONIST You're the man. 
STELLA So what's on the line-up? 
RECEPTIONIST 2:00. Home safe in Fairmount Park. Owner died and the wife never knew the combination. And Todd Milliken called. He has a prototype combination lock he wants you to test out tomorrow morning. Says he added two false contact points on the tumbler. 
STELLA Tell him if I don't have it opened in six minutes flat, breakfast is on me. 
RECEPTIONIST And there's a Charlie Croker in your office. He said you two know each other. (an aside) And he looks pretty fine for a white boy. 
Without a response, Stella heads over to -- 
HER OPEN OFFICE DOOR 
and sees him fiddling with her collection of safe doors that line the shelves. 
STELLA Charlie Croker. 
He turns around. Smiles. Charming. 
CHARLIE Hi, Stella. 
She steps inside. 
STELLA Refresh my memory. After you came to see me and told me what happened to my father, I told you I never wanted to see you again, didn't I? 
CHARLIE Yeah. You did. 
STELLA So I'm a little confused. 
CHARLIE I found him. 
At first it seems that Charlie's words have no effect on her, but then he notices that her hands are trembling. 
CHARLIE I can tell you where he is. 
STELLA I don't want to know. 
CHARLIE Are you sure? 
She doesn't answer. 
CHARLIE He's in Los Angeles. 
She doesn't respond. Doesn't ask him to go on, doesn't ask him not to. So he goes on... 
CHARLIE The gold bricks he stole from us were minted in Singapore and decorated with the face of a Balinese girl. I've had my tentacles out and got a call from a friend of mine and your father's, Philly Steak. 
Stella remembers him. 
STELLA When I was little he would play poker at the house and drop quarters under the table for me to find. 
CHARLIE He got word from an L.A. connection named Skinny Pete that a gold dealer has been buying bricks with the Balinese girl on them, three or four at a time. 
STELLA You ever heard the expression, cut to the chase? 
Suddenly a BUSBOY stumbles and a tray of drinks fall, soaking Richard's suit in red wine. 
BUSBOY Oh, man. I'm sorry. 
RICHARD You should be. Moron. What the hell's wrong with you? 
BUSBOY It was an accident. I'm very sorry. 
RICHARD Where's the manager? Richard Worth is not paying to have his suit cleaned. Damn. (to Stella) I'm going to... I don't believe this. 
He starts off to the bathroom and as soon as the space he was occupying empties, Charlie fills it. 
CHARLIE I think your date's going pretty well, what do you think? 
She shoots him a look that could reverse global warming. 
STELLA What are you doing here? 
CHARLIE What do you mean? I come here all the time. 
STELLA I don't think so. 
CHARLIE Sure. Lawyers, Judges, my kind of crowd. See that gentleman there, he sentenced me to 90 days in county once. We need to talk. 
STELLA No, you need to listen. I want you to leave. Got it? 
CHARLIE Hey, I paid valet parking prices to get in here, not to mention a twenty spot to the busboy to spill that drink on Mister Zipper. 
STELLA You -- I don't believe this. You paid someone to spill that drink? 
CHARLIE Actually, you paid for it. 
Charlie returns her wallet. 
CHARLIE Didn't notice it was me who bumped into you earlier, did you? Anyway, I was hoping we could get to know each other a little better before we leave for Los Angeles. I already booked your flight. 
STELLA You truly are a fatuous, odious man. 
CHARLIE I have no idea what you just said, but I like the sound of it. 
STELLA Well maybe you'll understand this. Hit the road, Jack -- 
CHARLIE Charlie -- 
STELLA Or you'll be sorry, Charlie, cause I'll kick you in the nuts so hard that your voice will be as high as my heels. 
She means it, too. 
CHARLIE I'm beginning to worry about this whole relationship. 
STELLA I'll let you in on a secret. You can't have a relationship with a pickpocket, gold robber, or any kind of thief. 
Charlie looks away, lets her have her point. This whole thing is getting pretty heated so when he turns back to her, he uses a whole new approach. His emotions are genuine. 
CHARLIE John wasn't just a man I crewed up with, he was my friend, he was the closest thing to a father I ever had. I wish to God I could bring him back. But all I can do is go after this guy, the guy that killed him, and hit him where he lives. 
She feels the honesty in his words but before she can reply, they're interrupted by -- 
RICHARD Everything alright, Stella? 
He's back, red wine splotched on his suit. 
STELLA Fine. Richard. Charlie. Charlie was just saying goodbye. 
But for now, Charlie is just staring at Richard, boring into to him... 
RICHARD Can I help you with something? 
CHARLIE Oh, sorry. I was just undressing you with my eyes. 
And with that, Charlie goes. Stella can't help but smile. 
EXT. STELLA'S CONDO - NIGHT 
She comes home, having shed her date. 
INT. STELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
She goes through a drawer and pulls out a package she hasn't looked at for years. She opens it. 
Inside is the beautiful necklace that her father bought her in Italy. It brings tears to her eyes. 
INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
CHARLIE (V.O.) One M-80 in the toilet bowl too many. 
Some kids in the bathroom saw the whole thing. 
KID That was rad! 
HALF-EAR Wha'? 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. MINI - DAY 
And now a RUMBLING in the distance. Stella looks. Sees a car streaking their way, almost like a mirage in the heat waves coming off the pavement. Closer. Faster. A classic Mustang. Its engine rumbles like a jackhammer. It's had some serious custom work done to it. 
CHARLIE Handsome Rob. Premier wheel man. He once drove all the way to L.A. just so he could set the record for longest freeway chase. 
QUICK CUT TO: 
EXT. L.A. FREEWAY - 1999 - DAY 
Handsome Rob's behind the wheel, flicks a cigarette butt out his open window -- 
We watch it hit the pavement, ashes spark, and then behind the fallen butt we see that every lane of the 405 is filled with cop cars in pursuit. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) Smashed the mark by twelve minutes. 
We now see Handsome Rob through the lens of a TV news helicopter camera. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) He got a hundred and ten love letters sent to his jail cell from women who saw him on TV. 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. MINI - DAY 
As the cars converge in the parking lot... 
STELLA And what about you? 
CHARLIE I've been a thief since I had baby teeth. 
QUICK CUT TO: 
INT. GRAMMAR SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY 
SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE is shoved against a chain link fence by a SIXTH GRADE BULLY. 
BULLY Cough it up, Charlie! 
Charlie hands the bully a dollar bill. The bully puts it in a wallet that is over-stuffed with cash and saunters off, laughing it up with his bully pals. Charlie turns to his 2nd grade classmate who sports a fresh black eye. 
CLASSMATE So much for lunch. 
SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE You need a dollar? 
CLASSMATE I thought he took your last one. 
SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE He did. 
Charlie holds up the over-stuffed wallet that he pickpocketed from the bully. 
SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE But I got lots more now. 
CUT BACK TO: 
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 
Doors open simultaneously. Everyone out. The crew eyes Stella. Charlie gets right down to business. 
CHARLIE This is Stella. She's working with us on this one. IDs? 
Handsome Rob hands out fake driver's licenses. 
LYLE (reading his) Melvin Lisp? Could I -- just once -- have a cool name? 
HALF-EAR (also complaining) 220 pounds? Try 180. 
HANDSOME ROB Try 'Deal A Meal'. 
LYLE I don't even have a cool nickname. 
CHARLIE Enough of this sewing-circle shit. Phones. 
Half-Ear hands out new cell phone to everyone and takes their old phones. 
Half-Ear peers through binoculars and says his notes into a micro-cassette recorder. His binoculars focus in on the fence that surrounds the perimeter of the property. 
HALF-EAR (into recorder) We've got an anti-scaling fence. Hardened, electroplated steel. Hacksaw won't work. We'll need Nitramon. 
The binoculars SWISH PAN TO a guard booth where a guard keeps an eye on the gate. 
HALF-EAR Armed guard. 9MM semi-automatic in the holster. Security booth is accessible and ideal for a triple charger chemical grenade. 
The binoculars SWISH PAN TO four Rottweilers prowling the grounds. 
HALF-EAR Shit. Dogs. Why do black men hate dogs? I'll tell you why, Charlie. Because dogs are racist. That's a natural fact. Someone else deal with 'em. 
EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY 
A sea of cars, gridlock in L.A. Crammed in the middle of the traffic meltdown is Handsome Rob's rental car. 
INT. RENTAL CAR (CRAWLING) 
Timing out the getaway route. He's got a Thomas Guide on the passenger seat and a stopwatch ticking away but he's going nowhere fast. He futilely leans on the car horn. 
INT. U-HAUL - DAY 
Lyle's surveillance shift. He takes digital photos with a telephoto camera. ZOOMS IN on a security pad on the front door. 
LYLE (into micro cassette player) Advent Home Navigator Hybrid System. Monitors 132 points for intrusion, fire, and environmental hazards. Best way around it is to get a back door password, trip the alarm during the heist, then call it in as a false alarm. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - OFFICE - DAY 
A HAND turns the dial to a Worthington 1000 vault. The vault opens and voila: stacks and stacks of gold bricks. 
EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE -DAY 
The same hand clutches a very heavy duffle bag. OUR VIEW BOOMS UP to see Steve, three years older than when we last saw him, his beard shaved away. 
INT. U-HAUL - SAME TIME 
Through his digital camera lens, Lyle watches Steve walk towards his car: a Ferrari 550 Barchetta Pininfarina. It's the first time he's seen Steve in three years. 
LYLE (into micro cassette recorder) 15:25. There he is. He's gained 15 to 20 pounds living off our money. And Handsome Rob, you're going to be pissed when you see his wheels. 
Lyle watches the security guard hit a switch in the guard booth. The gate rises like the blade of a guillotine in reverse. The Ferrari zooms away. 
EXT. FIGUEROA STREET - DAY 
Another route. Handsome Rob's rental car is in the left turn lane waiting for the light to change. 
INT. RENTAL CAR 
The light finally is a green arrow but the lady in front of Handsome Rob is so preoccupied with applying her make-up that she doesn't go until he honks but by then it's too late as she makes it through the light but he doesn't. 
He checks his stopwatch. Simmers. 
EXT. PENINSULA HOTEL - POOLS SIDE - DAY 
In a bikini, Stella lies on a lounge chair under a cabana, reading a copy of Vogue magazine. 
But as we take a closer look, we see that she's really reading the owner's manual for the Worthington 1000 safe which she's inserted in the fold of Vogue. 
INT. U-HAUL - DAY 
Charlie's shift. He sees a Latina housekeeper get into her car. 
CHARLIE (into micro cassette recorder) Housekeeper leaves at 17:30. 
EXT. COIN & BULLION STORE - EVENING 
Steve bangs a fist against the steel security door that covers the closed store. The steel door rises up and a Ukrainian named YEVHEN unlocks another door. He is the gold dealer that Philly Steak told Charlie about. 
YEVHEN You're right on time. 
INT. COIN & BULLION STORE - EVENING 
Yevhen is 50 and like many in the gold trade, there isn't a conspiracy theory that he doesn't embrace. As they make their way to a back room, he keeps his mouth in overdrive -- 
YEVHEN All those poor bastards out there putting their life savings in banks and S&Ls and mutual funds. What do they think -- that when the collapse comes they can depend on the government? I don't think so. 
Steve motions to a security camera that looms down on them. 
STEVE Is the camera off? 
YEVHEN Of course. Just like you said. I never tape you, you can see for yourself. 
Service trucks pull into the lot. Technicians are getting out, finishing their shifts. 
INT. RENTAL CAR (PARKED NEARBY) 
Handsome Rob behind the wheel. Lyle shotgun, aiming his digital camera at the exiting workers. 
LYLE I'm telling you. He claims he named it Napster because his hair is so nappy underneath that cap of his. But I know the real reason. It's because I was NAPPING when he stole the idea from me. I should've been on the cover of Wired magazine. 
HANDSOME ROB Would you clam up. You'd give a woodpecker a headache. 
LYLE I'm the Napster. 
HANDSOME ROB Okay. You're the Napster. Heads up: cable chick. 
They see a female service tech getting out of her work truck. 
Lyle zooms his camera lens in on her Adelphia Cable work shirt. It has BECKY sewn in above her right breast. 
LYLE Becky. Nice name. I wonder what she calls the other one. 
HANDSOME ROB And it's such a mystery why you don't have a girlfriend. 
LYLE I had a girlfriend. Unfortunately even though the relationship ceased in an objective reality, it's still going on in my mind. (tapping his head) That woman's lived in here rent-free for four years. 
Lyle takes a few more pictures of Becky. 
LYLE Okay. All we need now is a work shirt like this one and a service truck like that one. You think Stella will be able to pull it off? 
HANDSOME ROB I have my doubts, but there's no talking to Charlie. 
LYLE Maybe he's been inserting his hard drive into her software. Clouds the judgment. 
HANDSOME ROB He knows better than to mix business with pleasure. (getting out of the car) Only I'm allowed to do that. 
LYLE Where you going? 
HANDSOME ROB To get a work shirt and a service truck. 
Lyle watches him stroll over to Becky and strike up a conversation in the parking lot. Lyle can't hear what's being said, but Becky smiles, and lest we forget, his name is Handsome Rob for a reason. 
INT. BECKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
OUR CAMERA FOLLOWS a trail of clothes, hastily littered, that lead to the cable chick's bed. Lit candles are on the bedside table. The couple is asleep under a tangle of sheets. Handsome Rob has clearly mixed business with pleasure. His eyes flash open. 
He slips out of bed. Pulls on his pants. Reaches into her pants and removes her key chain. 
He selects the key to her service truck and does an old trick: he blows out one of the candles and presses the key against the warm wax, making a clear impression of the key's ridges. 
He returns the key chain. Takes a couple more steps, past her panties, past her bra and. 
He snags her work shirt. Then he's gone. 
INT. HANDSOME ROB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Using locksmith equipment, he cuts a key that matches the impression on the candle wax. 
EXT. ADELPHIA CABLE PARKING LOT - DAWN 
Stella, wearing Becky's work shirt, arrives before any other workers. Using the key Handsome Rob made, she unlocks the door to the cable truck and gets in. 
EXT. NEARBY STREET - MORNING 
The cable truck pulls over. Charlie and Lyle climb into the back where they can't be seen. 
EXT. OPORTO DRIVE -MORNING 
The cable repair truck pulls over, parking down the street from Steve's house. 
Charlie gets out. He quickly uses a crowbar to lift up a sidewalk cement grate that says CABLE on it. Inside are cable wires that feed the street. He crouches over and uses pliers to disconnect one of the cables. 
INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - MORNING 
He drifts into the kitchen for a cup of coffee. He hits the remote control for a TV. It turns on but there's nothing but snow. 
He goes into the living room and checks out the plasma TV. 
The cable's not working in here, either. He hits an intercom button on his telephone. 
INT. GUARD HOUSE - INTERCUT 
A SECURITY GUARD answers the intercom. 
SECURITY GUARD What can I do for you, Mister Frezelli? 
CHARLIE Minis? 
STELLA We could rumble right up the front steps, bring the getaway car right to the vault, and then straight to Union Station. 
Handsome Rob likes it. 
HANDSOME ROB We'll need three to hold the gold. 
EXT. CAR RENTAL COMPANY - DAY 
Parked in the lot are shimmering Supercharged Mini Coopers, a new model that still captures the legendary Mini look and feel. 
Half-Ear climbs in one Mini. Lyle into another. 
INT. CAR RENTAL COMPANY - SAME TIME 
In the background, a large window overlooks the lot. 
Handsome Rob fills out the paperwork on the Mini he's renting while flirting with a petite COUNTER BABE. 
HANDSOME ROB I'd say you're a Maserati 250 S. Just 4 cylinders but can go 0 to 60 in 4.2. 
COUNTER BABE As long as it's a convertible -- I always like to have my top down. 
At the same time, in the background, we see Lyle and Half- Ear's Mini pull out of their parking spaces and BACK RIGHT INTO EACH OTHER. Just a little bumper hit. 
COUNTER BABE Do you know them? 
They get out of their cars and start yelling at each other. 
HANDSOME ROB Never seen 'em before in my life. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. YEVHEN'S COIN & BULLION STORE - NIGHT 
Steve bangs a fist against the steel security door that covers the closed store. The steel door rises up and once again Yevhen unlocks another door. 
YEVHEN You're early. 
STEVE And I'm in a hurry, okay? 
INT. YEVHEN'S COINS & BULLION STORE - NIGHT 
It doesn't seem to matter if Steve's in a hurry or not, Yevhen still runs at the mouth while heading into the back room. 
YEVHEN Of course the Florida vote rigging was a CIA and Mob operation. 
STEVE (with total disinterest) That a fact? 
YEVHEN You want facts? Fact: CIA officials were allowed free -- and illegal -- access to official election material. 
Steve puts his duffel bag down on the table. It THUDS. Once again, he pulls out three gold bricks that each weigh 25 pounds. 
YEVHEN Now given the sordid history in Miami of joint ventures between Central Intelligence and the Mob, which led to the unsuccessful attempts to kill Fidel Castro and the successful assassination of your President John F. Kennedy, this conjunction raises numerous red flags. 
STEVE And I'd love to hear more about it, but like I said... 
YEVHEN Don't worry, we'll have you out in no time. The cash is on its way. 
Steve cocks his head, as if he could not have heard right. 
STEVE On its way? 
YEVHEN My cousin is bringing it over. 
STEVE Your cousin? 
YEVHEN Yes. Cousin Mashkov. 
STEVE He's on his way? 
YEVHEN Don't worry, he will be here any minute. 
Steve looks up to the security camera. 
STEVE The tape's off? 
YEVHEN Of course. Believe me, he doesn't want to be on video, either. 
STEVE Yevhen. Didn't I tell you, many times, that I never wanted to meet with anyone but you? 
Yevhen sweats a bit. 
LYLE But he ran into me. 
HANDSOME ROB He's not driving either. (to Stella) You ever got a speeding ticket? 
STELLA Let's put it this way: I can only get insurance through companies that advertise on TV at 3:00 in the morning. 
HANDSOME ROB You drive. I drive. Charlie drives. 
CHARLIE I got us spots for three cars on a car carrier and five first class seats. Train 59 from Union Station to New Orleans. 
HALF-EAR That's N'Or'lins, Yankee. 
CHARLIE What's the word on Rockefeller? 
LYLE The Traffic Control Center is on the top floor of a building on Olympic and Grand. They get their data from pavement loop detectors and video image vehicle detectors. That info is fused together by specially designed algorithms to predict traffic conditions and control the traffic lights. So all I have to do now is change the data by creating my own algorithm. 
CHARLIE What can I do to help? 
LYLE I need to hard-wire into the mainframes. 
EXT. TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER - NIGHT 
Housed in a towering building on the corner of Olympic and Grand in the heart of downtown L.A. OUR VIEW RISES UP to the rooftop, where WE FIND Charlie and Lyle. 
OUR VIEW MOVES IN CLOSER on Charlie, who adroitly picks the lock to an access door and they climb down a short set of steps into the 
INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS SHOT 
From an equipment bag, Charlie pulls out a silent power drill and uses it to remove an access panel from the AC vent. 
INT. AIR-CONDITIONING VENT - NIGHT 
Charlie leads, crawling through this tight space, his path illuminated by the thin beam of a penlight. 
INT. TRAFFIC CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT 
A high-tech setting with a half-dozen workers overseeing the large traffic information monitors that display multiple images. 
OUR CAMERA PUSHES IN on the wall of monitors and then BLACKNESS as OUR VIEW CROSSES to the -- 
OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL 
Where the 70" tall mainframe computers are housed and running. We see that the AC vent to this room is now open since Charlie and Lyle have already snuck inside. 
They move fast. Charlie removes the rear panels of the mainframes while Lyle adeptly hard-wires his laptop into the computers. The laptop's screen lights up. 
Charlie fits two false panels where the rear panels of the mainframes used to be. Lyle pulls an innocent looking filing box out of his equipment bag. He places the box on a nearby shelf where it enjoys line-of-sight to the false panels. 
He punches a key on his laptop and the false panels and the filing box quietly clicks into action, communicating with his laptop via infrared. His laptop now shows a guiltwork of thumbnail views from the traffic information monitors. 
Typing commands, Lyle is clearly operating on a higher bandwidth than the rest us. 
LYLE B4 X TTratio, where Bi are Fisher's linear discriminant function coefficients, SpdRat is the speed ratio, and TTratio is the travel time ratio. 
CHARLIE I have no idea what you're doing. Just do it fast. 
There. 
He hits the ENTER button. 
LYLE We own this place. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE PANTRY RESTAURANT - DOWNTOWN L.A. - DAY 
Their motto: "Never closed. Never without a customer!" The place has the same decor as it did 75 years ago. It's also a spot where everyone minds their own business. One of the OLD TIME WAITERS leads OUR CAMERA to a table in the back where Mashkov sits across from a LAPD HOMICIDE DETECTIVE. He slides over an envelope of cash and a photograph of Karen. 
MASHKOV $2000. And this is the new girl. Fresh off the bus. One of Danya's guys picked her up hitchhiking downtown. 
The detective checks out the photo. 
DETECTIVE Those tits'd make Dracula rise from his coffin at high-noon. 
MASHKOV They're all yours Saturday. You can do whatever you want to her. Her name is Karen... 
DETECTIVE You're too generous. 
MASHKOV I needed a fast answer. 
DETECTIVE And I'm the Shell Answer Man. A guy who works the counter at your cousin's shop told me that someone named Skinny Pete had been asking around about gold bricks with the face of a Balinese girl on them. Same gold bricks your cousin was buying. 
MASHKOV You talked to this Skinny Pete? 
LYLE For those about to rock, we salute you. 
EXT. OPORTO DRIVE - NIGHT 
From side streets, the Minis converge on the road and head up towards Steve's house. 
INT. CHARLIE'S MINI (MOVING) - NIGHT 
He can feel the adrenaline already starting to course through is body. 
CHARLIE This is it, guys. Moment of truth. 
He takes a sharp curve... and the moment that Steve's house should come into view... he hits the brakes, his expression turning to complete surprise. 
HIS POV 
The neighbor across the street from Steve is having the biggest party in town. The road is filled with parked cars and arriving guests. Ain't no way they're blowing the gate, launching chemical grenades or in any way robbing Steve's house in the midst of this. 
CHARLIE'S FACE 
As he takes this in, there's a KNOCK on the window. He turns. Sees a uniformed VALET. Rolls down the window. 
VALET Are you hear for the Baxter party, sir? 
EXT. OPORTO DRIVE - NIGHT 
We see the three Minis pull tight U-turns and head back the way they came. 
INT. CHARLIE'S MINI (MOVING) - NIGHT 
He slaps his hand against the steering wheel, fuming. 
CHARLIE Shit. Stella? 
INT. STELLA'S MINI (MOVING) - INTERCUT 
She already knows what he's going to say. 
STELLA I know. I've got a date tonight. 
CHARLIE You'll have to fake it. Laugh at his jokes. You need him to ask you out again. 
CUT TO: 
INT. AGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
A posh restaurant. As OUR CAMERA FINDS Stella and Steve, she is laughing at something he said, faking her way through the date. They're sitting at an intimate table. 
STELLA You really make laugh. 
He takes the lie like the compliment she wants him to think it is. 
STEVE So here's what I have lined up for after dinner. We'll go to Club Deep. The Ferrari always gets me to the front of the line. We'll do a little dancing... 
STELLA Not tonight. I don't want to be out late. 
STEVE Why the curfew? 
STELLA Let's just say I've made some wrong calls in the past. I like to take things slow, cautious. Next time... 
STEVE I understand. You have nothing to worry about. You can trust me. 
STELLA I trust everyone. It's the devil inside them that I don't trust. 
That saying strikes Steve. 
STEVE That's an interesting saying. 
STELLA What? 
He looks at her closely, really closely. 
STEVE There's only person I've ever heard say that. Used to say it all the time. 
This worries her. Because of course, she used to hear it from her father. 
STELLA Who was that? 
Under the table, he grabs her by the wrist, squeezes it like a vise. 
STEVE A man named John Bridger. Where did you pick up that phrase? 
STELLA Ow. I don't remember. You're hurting me. 
HANDSOME ROB Good news? 
CHARLIE Sometimes when you're up to your ass in alligators you forget that you started off trying to drain the swamp. 
HANDSOME ROB Meaning what the fuck? 
CHARLIE We've been trying to get to the gold in the safe. Now the safe is coming to us. We'll boost it in transit. 
He might as well have said they'll steal the Holy Grail before sunrise. 
HANDSOME ROB Charlie. He could take a dozen different routes to the airport and we have no idea which one. We can't take out an armored truck during rush hour. 
CHARLIE We're already set to do it. Napster: how would you like to create the biggest traffic jam in the history of Los Angeles? 
LYLE Keep talking. 
CHARLIE You gridlock every route except the one we choose. Force the truck to go exactly where we want it to go. 
HANDSOME ROB But where do we want it? We can't shoot it out with armed guards in a Brink's. We'd lose. And even if we pulled it off, the cops would be all over us, chasing us all the way to Union Station. We're outmanned and outgunned. 
CHARLIE But not outsmarted. 
Charlie hums with focused energy. There's a term for it in horse racing. When a thoroughbred is at peak condition, and twitching with eagerness to run, he is "on the muscle." That describes Charlie right now. 
CHARLIE We'll do it like the Italian job. We'll make thirty million in gold drop out of sight. 
They're interrupted by Charlie's cell phone RINGING. This throws them all off. 
CHARLIE Who else has this number? 
HALF-EAR No one but us. 
It's still RINGING. Charlie decides to answer it. 
CHARLIE Hello? 
INT. OFFICE - PHILADELPHIA - INTERCUT 
Meet PHILLY STEAK. Or at least meet the back of his neck. 
Because that's where he has a tatoo that says PHILLY STEAK. 
PHILLY STEAK Why'd you do it? 
CHARLIE (informing the crew) Philly Steak. (then into phone) Do what? 
OUR CAMERA TRACKS AROUND to Philly Steak's face which is weathered and as leathery as a football. An old school crook. 
PHILLY STEAK Yevhen. The Ukrainian gold, dealer. You didn't, have to clip him, for Christ's sakes. 
CHARLIE Clip him? 
PHILLY STEAK Listen to me. You've gotta get out of L.A. Now. 
CHARLIE What're you talking about? We didn't clip anybody. 
PHILLY STEAK Well Skinny Pete just called me. Yevhen's cousin is under the distinct impression that you did. 
CHARLIE Why does he think that? 
PHILLY STEAK Because you wanted, to know about the gold with the Balinese Girl. Plus I guess Pete was under duress. This Ukrainian thinks he's Paul Fucking Bunyan. 
CHARLIE Do you know how to get in touch with him? 
PHILLY STEAK Yeah but... 
CHARLIE Maybe there's a way we can play this to our advantage. 
PHILLY STEAK Are you out of your mind? Listen to me, Charlie. Get out of L.A. Now. Cause if there's one thing I know, it's that you never mess with Mother Nature, mother-in-laws, or mother- fucking Ukrainians. 
INT. SAFE HOUSE - MORNING 
Speaking of -- Five Ukrainians lock 'n load their MAC-11 machine pistols plus an M4 carbine with a 40mm grenade launcher mounted beneath the barrel. Mashkov enters the room and tells the others in SUBTITLED UKRAINIAN. 
MASHKOV He's going to be on Train 59 for New Orleans. 
UKRAINIAN You sure your source is good? 
MASHKOV I'm sure. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DANYA'S HOUSE - MORNING 
Job done, he calmly opens his mouth. The spider puts a hairy leg out and delicately explores his cheek. Half-Ear plucks it off just as delicately, depositing the spider on the wall. 
Charlie just shakes his head in disbelief. 
HALF-EAR My work here is done. 
EXT. OPORTO DRIVE -DAY 
A Brink's truck climbs the road towards Steve's house, flanked by two BMW K1200LTA motorcycles. 
EXT. MARAVILLA DRIVE - SAME TIME 
Through binoculars, Handsome Rob is still keeping an eye on Steve's house from the higher vantage point. 
HIS POV 
The front gate rises. The Brink's truck and motorcycles are let inside and head up the driveway. 
But then he sees a SECOND ARMORED truck drive up, also guarded by two motorcycles. And a third Brink's followed by motorcycles turns into the driveway. 
EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE 
It's a convoy of matching armored trucks... 
EXT. MARAVILLA DRIVE - DAY 
Witnessing the twist of events through his binoculars. He speaks into his headset mic -- 
HANDSOME ROB Problemo. 
INT. U-HAUL - INTERCUT 
The rest of the crew is now all in the U-Haul. Lyle's manning the laptop. 
CHARLIE What is it? 
HANDSOME ROB He's brought in three identical armored trucks. 
CHARLIE Shit. Decoys. It's like a shell game on wheels. 
LYLE How can I reroute the truck if I don't know which truck to reroute? 
EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE - (TIME CUT) - DAY 
The caravan of armored trucks and motorcycles now head down the driveway. The Ferrari follows behind. 
EXT. MARAVILLA DRIVE - DAY 
Handsome Rob sees the vehicles head east on Oporto. He reports into his mike: 
HANDSOME ROB Three Brink's trucks are leaving with motorcycle escorts, plus Steve in his Ferrari. 
INT. U-HAUL 
Maddening frustration. 
LYLE How're we going to figure out which truck has the gold? 
Charlie is just as frustrated... but in a tight spot he always comes up with an idea. 
CHARLIE You can monitor the traffic video cameras from your laptop, right? 
LYLE Yeah. 
CHARLIE Where's the first camera the trucks will go past? 
Lyle hits a command key and we now see the intersection of Woodrow Wilson Drive and Cahuenga where vehicles are driving under the traffic signal that a traffic video camera is mounted to. 
LYLE Cahuenga Boulevard. They all have to cross that. 
CHARLIE The weight of the gold will lower the suspension on the truck. 
EXT. CAHUENGA BOULEVARD - DAY 
The first armored truck makes its way through the green light. 
INT. U-HAUL 
Lyle hits the keyboard and lines of measurements appear across the image of the Brink's truck. He strikes another key, momentarily FREEZING the image. He makes a visual check of the top of the armored truck against the Cahuenga Boulevard street sign. 
LYLE Lines up with the top of the sign. Next... 
He unfreezes the first image just in time to check out the next armored truck in line. FREEZE. The top of this truck also lines up perfectly with the top of the street sign. 
He turns on the radio as -- 
INT. U-HAUL 
Lyle's fingers dance across the keyboard. 
LYLE Opening up a space on North Highland. 
INT. GOLD TRUCK 
Stuck in the middle of it. The driver and guard, both armed, are as confused as everyone else. 
GUARD Get us out of here. 
DRIVER I'm trying. 
He sees a way out, a sudden opening on North. Highland. 
INT. U-HAUL 
Via a traffic video camera, Lyle sees on his laptop the gold truck, followed by two motorcycles, making the turn onto North Highland. 
LYLE He's taking it... 
Lyle hits more keys. 
LYLE I now command you to turn left. 
EXT. GOLD TRUCK 
It comes to the next intersection. Every light is stuck on red -- except the left turn only signal which is green. No choice. The truck takes it. 
INT. U-HAUL 
He's striking keys, an orchestral conductor, the crew his audience. 
LYLE I've got it on Hollywood Boulevard. Time to slow down. 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD 
Signals turn green, but only for three seconds, long enough for one car to gun through it at a time. 
At the same time, we see Charlie get out of the U-Haul and climb into the first Mini. Stella gets into the second Mini. 
Half-Ear joins Handsome Rob in the third. 
INT. FERRARI - DAY 
Steve gets the scoop over the radio. He can't believe it. 
CHRISTINA GRIEGO (V.O.) According to the police, the computers at the Traffic Control Center are down. 
Steve knows who did that. 
STEVE Sonovabitch. 
INT. CHARLIE'S MINI -DAY 
Through his rearview mirror, Charlie eyes the gold truck creeping closer. 
CHARLIE Gentlemen, start your engines. 
THREE SHOTS 
Starting their engines-with souped-up, throaty roars: Charlie; Handsome Rob; Stella. 
CHARLIE Give us the flag when you're ready. 
INT. U-HAUL 
Lyle has hacked into the Metro Rail's Control System. Starts his magic. 
LYLE Shutting down the rail as we speak. 
INT. METRO RAIL TUNNELS - SEVERAL SHOTS 
A Metro is speeding through the Blue Line tunnel. Suddenly it loses power and comes to an inglorious stop. 
Another Metro stops on the Red Line. 
Inside a Metro on the Westside Corridor as it stops; confused passengers stare out the glass. 
INT. U-HAUL 
INT. U-HAUL - ON THE CUT 
Lyle hits a button on a remote control and -- 
EXT. U-HAUL 
Clamps unlock, releasing the heavy steel sheet from the side of the U-Haul. It SLAMS DOWN, neatly covering the gaping hole in the road like a huge manhole cover. 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD & HIGHLAND 
The motorcycles following the Brink's come to a sudden stop. 
The motorcycle guards watch the smoke clear. The armored truck has vanished! Vaporized in the gridlock! Gone! 
Pandemonium. People scatter. A man jumps out of his BMW and sprints away from the explosion. 
Lyle gets out of the U-Haul and runs to his getaway vehicle: the Vespa. He's about to hop on, but something stops him... 
The sight of the vacant, shimmering, 2002 BMW 750iL parked just ahead, keys dangling from the ignition. 
At the same time, the motorcycle guards climb off their bikes. Draw semi-automatic handguns. Result: more madness Bystanders flee. 
The BMW tears out of there, Lyle behind the wheel. 
INT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL - DAY 
The rear door to the Brink's is open. Our crew sees the Worthington 1000 inside. 
CHARLIE Nice work. 
HALF-EAR Well like Einstein almost said: genius is ten percent inspiration, ninety percent detonation. 
CHARLIE Let's get our gold. 
Stella goes up to the imposing safe. Gives it a look of momentary respect, then sets to work... 
INT. KNX-AM 1070 TRAFFIC HELICOPTER - DAY 
Christina Griego telling her radio audience: 
CHRISTINA GRIEGO I've seen earthquakes, mudslides, fires, riots, but this... Let me try to paint a picture for our listeners. 
INT. FERRARI 
Hearing the news over the radio. 
CHRISTINA GRIEGO (V.O.) There's been some kind of an explosion and a Brink's truck has just dropped down into the Metro Rail Blue Line. 
Steve slams the car into gear and jumps the sidewalk, passing the gridlock. He hollers into a walkie-talkie -- 
STEVE The truck's in the Metro Rail. Where does the Blue Line go back above ground? 
EXT. STREETS - SERIES OF SHOTS 
The motorcycle guards who were escorting the decoy trucks hear Steve over their walkie-talkies. With squeals of rubber, they turn around as one of the guards answers -- 
MOTORCYCLE GUARD It comes out at Flower & Pico. 
At the same time -- 
INT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL - DAY 
Stella works the dial, feeling for contact points. And -- 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD & HIGHLAND - DAY 
The two motorcycle guards fervently try to lift off the steel sheet that dropped down from the U-Haul. 
INT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL - DAY 
They see daylight start to stream in from above as the steel sheet slides a little. 
CHARLIE Stella? 
STELLA Shhh... 
We HEAR Stella's heart pounding in her ears. See the perspiration on her fingertips. 
STELLA You know when you said this wouldn't be the same as opening a safe for the cops? 
HANDSOME ROB Yeah. 
STELLA Did you have to be right? 
EXT. CHARLIE'S MINI 
Turning onto Exposition, the motorcycle in pursuit, the chopper overhead. 
His red Mini jumps a curve, now on a wide sidewalk, accelerating full throttle for the horizon while pedestrians flatten themselves against a high-rise in fear. 
INT. CHARLIE'S MINI 
He sees someone give him the finger. Mutters: 
CHARLIE If you don't like how I'm driving, get off the damn sidewalk. 
Meanwhile: 
INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI 
He's got the other motorcycle on his tail, RELENTLESS GUNFIRE dogging his every move. 
He shifts smooth as silk, squeezing between a car he's passing and an oncoming car in the other lane. Half-Ear is trying his best to remain calm but Jesus, that was close. 
Suddenly, Handsome Rob veers off the road and WHAM. He takes down a chain link fence and is now in the parking lot of the: 
EXT. CONVENTION CENTER 
His white Mini catapults across the asphalt, the motorcycle still right behind. 
INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI 
Up ahead, he eyes the open door entrance to the Convention Center. Stomps the gas. 
HALF-EAR What are you doing? 
The turbine howls. 
HALF-EAR What -- are -- you -- doing? 
EXT. CONVENTION CENTER 
The Mini squeezes through the doorway and into the -- 
INT. CONVENTION CENTER 
It's the STAR TREK GRAND SLAM 2002 convention in full swing. 
Display tables are lined up in the cavernous hall and the Mini snakes through the maze and the Trekkies as -- 
The motorcycle follows right behind and the chase is really on now. 
THUDA THUD THUDA, the Mini's wheels climb a flight of steps. 
Waves of people flee the path of the little car and -- 
THUD, THUDA, THUD, the motorcycle follows right behind. 
The Mini zips down the wide Concourse Hall -- travels underneath banners of Star Trek characters that hang from the ceiling -- the motorcycle keeps up, tires tearing into the carpeting. 
INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI 
He shifts, swerves, avoiding people, obstacles. 
HALF-EAR Go that way! 
Handsome Rob turns, taking them down the -- 
WEST HALL 
that stretches out toward the Staples Center. 
WHIZ. The Mini goes by. WHIZ. The motorcycle goes by. 
Then -- 
The Mini steamrolls through the exit doors and -- 
EXT. CONVENTION CENTER/STAPLES CENTER 
It bounds down outdoor steps and ramps onto the outside entrance to the Staples Center, fitting snugly between cement pillars that are designed to keep regular-sized cars out. 
INT. STAPLES CENTER - DAY 
The Mini bulldozes through glass doors. Across the lobby. 
Down an aisle that leads right to -- 
Lyle's coasting down Exposition Boulevard towards Union Station. Clear sailing for him. 
He sees a young woman thumbing for a ride. It's Karen. And he recognizes her: she was hitchhiking when he first arrived in L.A. He pulls over. To Lyle, she might be an angel in the empyrean if she wasn't, so completely, a woman. 
LYLE Where are you going? 
KAREN Away. 
LYLE How about far, far away? 
KAREN The farther the better. 
EXT. FIGUEROA & OLYMPIC - DAY 
Charlie's still having a helluva time getting rid of the motorcycle. It screams like a Banshee as it streaks up alongside the Mini. Charlie suddenly sees an AK-47 pointed right at him. 
INT. CHARLIE'S MINI 
He jerks the steering wheel and swerves off the street, driving through the parking lot of the historic Hotel Figueroa. 
With the motorcycle dogging his heels, he looks up at the building. It has three towers that rise up 12 stories, with a giant mural of Albert Einstein covering one of the towers 
(it's an ad for Apple Computers: Think different.) 
Suddenly the LAPD helicopter swoops down towards the parking lot, shattering the air, blowing up dirt and discarded newspapers in a rush of turbo-wash, trying to box in the Mini. 
INT. CHARLIE'S MINI 
He's got no place else to go... 
INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA 
The Mini squeezes through the entrance and into the lobby with its exotic Moroccan decor. Horrified guests catapult out of the way. The Mini drives past wooden statues, potted palm trees. 
The motorcycle follows the car as it streaks towards the elevator. Charlie looks back, sees the motorcycle. The elevator door opens. Some tourists step off. 
CHARLIE Going up? 
INT. ELEVATOR 
The Mini darts right in, not an inch to spare. Charlie reaches out the window, presses the button for ROOF. 
He sees the motorcycle charging after him, burning rubber across the beautiful tiled floor. Closer, closer. 
The door closes just in time. 
A second elevator opens, the motorcycle zooms inside, people screaming at the sight of the guns. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY 
The doors open, PING, and the Mini reverses out, spins. 
LOOKING DOWN onto the building's rooftop, we see that it is shaped like a capitol E, three towers connected by a narrow strip. Each tower has its own elevator. 
INT. CHARLIE'S MINI 
He wants to drive across the rooftop strip but there's a big problem: the giant sign that exclaims HOTEL FIGUEROA in red and white neon lights blocks so much of the strip that even the Mini couldn't squeeze through. 
In his rearview, he sees the second elevator door open and out comes the motorcycle. He's trapped up here. But he's not about to abandon ship. 
EXT. ROOFTOP 
So he floors it, slaps the gears, hurtles to the edge of the first tower and in -- 
EYE-POPPING CGI SLOW MOTION SHOTS 
His car hurls into the wide blue empty space... The ground deliriously distant... Spiraling through the air like a football... 
NEXT TOWER - ROOFTOP 
The Mini lands right-side-up with a THUD. Charlie, rattled, looks over his shoulder and sees the LAPD helicopter rising over the rooftop, turbines SCREAMING. 
And here comes the motorcycle. Flying from one section of the rooftop to the next. It lands and the driver REVS it forward -- 
I/E CHARLIE'S MINI 
He speeds toward the edge of the roof and launches off towards the third tower some twenty feet away. Lands. Keeps going to the last elevator, skids to a stop. 
He reaches out, punches the call button. Then looks over his shoulder to witness -- 
THE MOTORCYCLE 
going full throttle to make the final rooftop to rooftop jump. 
Then Mashkov RISES out of the trunk of the white Mini. 
Another Ukrainian RISES out of the trunk of the blue Mini. 
Four more Ukrainians slide out from underneath the Minis. 
They cock their M-lls. 
CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK. 
Steve hears the sound from behind him. He turns around to see the weapons pointed at him. 
MASHKOV Take out your gun and drop it on the floor. 
Steve has no choice. 
STEVE Who are you? 
MASHKOV You knew my cousin. Yevhen. 
STEVE I never knew anyone named Yevhen. 
MASHKOV Get in the trunk. Not that trunk, this one. That gold is for us. A gift from some old friends of yours. They said to tell you that they didn't mind sharing the box of Cracker Jack, as long as you didn't get any. Not even the toy surprise. 
The Ukrainians force Steve into the trunk of the white Mini. 
And for the first time, he's scared. Looking up at Mashkov, he begs. 
STEVE Please. Don't shoot me. Please... 
MASHKOV Don't worry. That wasn't the deal. I'm not going to shoot you. 
STEVE Thank you. Thank God. 
MASHKOV (to the others) He really thought I was going to shoot him. 
The Ukrainians laugh. Steve tries to laugh. 
MASHKOV No. No. I'm not going to shoot you. I'm going to hack off your limbs and bury you while you're still alive. 
And with that, he closes the trunk. THUD. Like the lid of a coffin. And for Steve, the world falls into BLACKNESS. 
INT. FIRST CLASS CAR - SAME TIME 
Underneath the crew's seats, we see the other two silver Haliburton suitcases filled with the rest of the gold. We BOOM UP to our five thieves... 
CHARLIE New IDs. 
Handsome Rob passes out new fake driver's licenses for when they arrive in New Orleans. 
LYLE (re: his fake license) Simon Quackenbush? Could I -- just once -- have a cool name? 
HALF-EAR (also complaining) 250_pounds? 
They're interrupted by the RING of Charlie's phone. He answers. 
CHARLIE Did you get what you wanted? 
INT. CAR CARRIER - INTERCUT 
Mashkov is on the other end of the line. 
MASHKOV I'm happy. 
During this, Lyle types commands into his laptop that is connected to a phone jack in the car. 
CHARLIE It was good doing business with you. 
Lyle hits a final command and -- 
INT. ENGINEER ROOM - SAME TIME 
signal box receives the command and -- 
EXT. CAR CARRIER - SAME TIME 
The coupler between the car carrier and the rest of the train is electronically disengaged. 
This causes the train to separate from the car carrier. The train speeds on without it at 100 miles per hour. 
The car carrier slowly comes to a stop in the middle of nowhere.

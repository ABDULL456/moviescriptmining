All gave some. Some gave all. 1   OVER BLACK                                                  1 
The groan of tank treads drowns out THE CALL TO PRAYER as an entire MARINE COMPANY advances over the top of us. 
2   EXT. STREET, FALLUJAH, IRAQ - DAY                           2 
The sun melts over squat residences on a narrow street. MARINE COMPANY creeps toward us like a cautious Goliath. FOOT SOLDIERS walk alongside Humvees and tanks. 
COMMANDING OFFICER (OS) (radio chatter) Charlie Bravo-3, we got eyes on you from the east. Clear to proceed, over. 
3   EXT. ROOFTOP, "OVERWATCH" - SAME                            3 
Sun glints off a slab of corrugated steel. Beneath it-- 
CHRIS KYLE lays prone, dick in the dirt, eye to the glass of a .300 Win-Mag sniper rifle. He's Texas stock with a boyish grin, blondish goatee and vital blue eyes. Both those eyes are open as he tracks the scene below, sweating his ass off in the shade of steel. 
CHRIS KYLE Fucking hot box. 
GOAT (24, Arkansas Marine) lies beside him, woodsy and outspoken, watching dirt-devils swirl in the street. 
GOAT Dirt over here tastes like dog shit. 
CHRIS KYLE I guess you'd know. 
Goat balks and fixes his M4 on the rooftop door. 
CHRIS SCOPE POV 
TRACK ACROSS bombed-out buildings, twisted metal and golden-domed mosques. Ragged curtains flutter out a window. Cat-tails on the river sway the same direction. We see him studying windage; we see what he's thinking-- 
SFX: A LOW FREQUENCY BUZZ escalates over picture as his concentration deepens. Cross-hairs land on-- 
A MAN ON CELL PHONE watches the convoy from a rooftop. 
CHRIS KYLE (keys mike) I got a military-aged male, on a cell phone, watching the convoy. Over. 
COMMANDING OFFICER (OS) If you think he's reporting troop movement you have a green-light. Your call. Over. 
GOAT (OC) He could be calling his old lady. 
MAN ON CELL studies the convoy, his hair tossed by wind. CROSS-HAIR push left of target, compensating for windage. 
SFX: Chris takes a deep inhale, holds it, then expels. 
His finger is taking up trigger-slack when the man dips his shoulder slightly. Chris holds off as-- 
MAN ON CELL hangs up and steps away. 
CHRIS KYLE (keys mike) He stepped off. 
Chris sucks air. Close. The ambient world floods back in. Barked orders, diesel engines and-- 
A WOMAN AND KID exit the same structure. They're headed up the sidewalk but cut sharply into the street. 
CHRIS KYLE (keys mike) Hold up. I got a woman and a kid, 200 yards out, moving toward the convoy. 
(ECU)-- The woman cradles something beneath her robes. 
CHRIS KYLE Her arms aren't swinging. She's carrying something. 
CROSS-HAIRS ON WOMAN as she pulls a cylindrical object from her robes. His vision obscured but-- 
CHRIS KYLE She just pulled a grenade. An RKG Russian grenade. I think she gave it to the kid. 
COMMANDING OFFICER (OS) --you say a woman and kid? 
SFX: his heart-beat, THUMP-THUMP THUMP-THUMP THUMP-THUMP. 
CHRIS KYLE You got eyes on this? Can you confirm? 
COMMANDING OFFICER (OS) Negative. You know the ROEs. Your call. 
GOAT (OC) They fry you if you're wrong. Send your ass to Leavenworth. 
THE KID moves toward the convoy with the grenade. 
CHRIS KYLE (OC) Fuck-- 
MOTHER motions the Kid to hurry along (ECU)-- her robes flutter, trash blows in the street, the dust off her son's footsteps; all blowing the same direction. 
THE KID sprints toward the Marines. 
IN THE STREET 
YOUNG MARINES. Wading into war. Boots scuffing dirt. 
CLOSE ON CHRIS 
Chris exhales, pauses, strokes-- BAM! 
32   INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE                                        32 
A ZOLOFT BROCHURE shows smiling faces. TAYA wears a suit- skirt and tries to mimic the esprit of the brochure. She leaves a box of samples with the RECEPTIONIST but her smile fades as she pulls her trolley to the door-- 
33   INT. TAYA'S CONDO - DAY                                     33 
Blades of light leak through closed blinds. Taya hides under blankets on the sofa. PHONE RINGS, goes to message: 
CHRIS (OS) It's me again. The guy whose shoes you puked on? I was thinking maybe you didn't get my last message. Or the one before that. So, I figured-- 
She snatches up the phone-- 
TAYA You figured what? 
--looking for a reason not to be alone. 
34   EXT. RANGE - CAMP BILLY MACHEN - DAY                      34 
ON CHRIS, both eyes open looking downrange. 
PO TOSH (OC) Aim small, miss small. If you aim for his shirt button, you might miss by two inches. If you aim for his shirt, you miss by two feet. (over Chris, raises binocs) You better close those groupings, Kyle. 
Chris chases his breath, trying to focus, but-- 
35   EXT. OCEANSIDE PIER - DUSK                                35 
PAN ACROSS a "target shoot" game to a bench overlooking surf. CHRIS and TAYA sit with a GIANT TEDDY BEAR. 
TAYA Did you always want to be a soldier? 
CHRIS I wanted to be a cowboy-- but I did that and I felt like I was meant for more. 
TAYA So you started rescuing girls from bars? 
CHRIS I rescued that bar from you. 
She smiles at his sweetness. 
CHRIS Do you like country music? 
TAYA Only when I'm depressed. 
CHRIS You want kids? 
TAYA Someday. My mom says I have a nose for picking the wrong men. 
CHRIS That's a shitty thing to tell a girl. 
TAYA I've proven her right. 
CHRIS But those wrong picks put you here. They made you who you are. And I like who you are. 
The Ferris wheel casts its glow on them. 
TAYA What happens when there's a real person on the other end of that gun? 
CHRIS (uncertain) I don't know... I just pray I can do my job if that day comes. 
It weighs on him. And she feels safe. 
BACK TO: 
35A   EXT. RANGE - CAMP BILLY MACHEN                            35A 
PO TOSH (on spotting scope) stands over CHRIS. Mirage boils off the horizon at 35 degree angle, pushed by wind. BAM! Chris' shot hits the outer edge of target. 
PO TOSH Mirage is boiling at 35 degree angle. 
CHRIS Check. I'm dialed for windage. 
PO TOSH Hold right-four, up-two. 
BAM! He misses. It spits dirt. Not even close. 
PO TOSH Are we looking at the same target? 
36    INT. TAYA'S CONDO - NIGHT                                   36 
CHRIS sits on the couch, anxious, until TAYA appears in the hall in lingerie. She slinks closer, straddling him, determined to blow his mind but-- 
CHRIS You're trembling... 
TAYA I know. I don't... 
She finds his eyes. Finds her breath. 
CHRIS We don't have to do this... 
TAYA I want to. I do... 
He gently lifts her up and lays her across the couch. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Soft light on pale bodies. Taya writhes with impatient longing but Chris' steady hand forces her into the present. She's swept up, eyes filling with tears as he eases into her-- she gasps and arcs and draws him deeper. 
ON DANCE FLOOR 
Taya sees the nod from Biggles to Chris, we're going. She tenses up in his arms, her feet growing heavy. 
CHRIS They say it'll be over in 6 weeks. 
TAYA I'm so afraid. 
CHRIS Don't be afraid. It's all part of the plan. 
He pulls her close, HIS EYES FIXED on someone else-- 
TAYA Your heart is beating out of your chest. 
CHRIS (nods, looking past her) I'm not the only one going to war. 
JEFF KYLE stands on the rail in MARINE DRESS UNIFORM. 
CAKE CUTTING - EVENING 
The boat rocks on choppy water. Taya dabs cake on Chris's nose and they kiss. THE BOOM of distant fireworks is followed by AIR-RAID SIRENS as shock & awe hit Baghdad. 
CUT TO BLACK. 
CHYRON: "OPERATION PHANTOM FURY: 2nd BATTLE OF FALLUJAH" 
MARC LEE (PRE-LAP) Welcome to Fallujah. The new wild west of the old middle east. 
44   INT. M-113 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER, FALLUJAH - DAY        44 
SOLDIERS sit elbow to elbow. 6 SEAL SNIPERS and A SQUAD OF MARINES to watch their backs. CHRIS tucks the little blue Bible and American flag and into his webbing then removes his wedding band, hanging it from his necklace. 
MARC LEE AO2 (26) is a poster-boy Navy Seal, soulful and handsome. He glows like a halo in a river full of shit. 
MARC LEE AQI have put a price on your heads and extremists from around the globe are flooding the borders to collect on it. 
The rig hits a pothole and faces clench expecting an IED. 
MARC LEE You snipers will be paired with a man to watch your back and inserted along the main road to do "overwatch" for 1st Marines going door to door. Your job is to protect those Marines at all costs. 
The truck battles to a stop. 
MARC LEE The city was evacuated. Any military-aged male still here, is here to kill you. Let's bring these boys in safe and get our asses back home. Move-- 
The hatch falls open-- 
45   EXT. HOSPITAL, NORTHERN BRIDGE, FALLUJAH                    45 
A gunmetal sky. The staccato pop of GUNFIRE in the distance. SNIPERS and SUPPORT cross an orchard. 
CHRIS walks upright. The Marine paired with Chris is a mouthy Arkansas boy, "WINSTON", skitters tree to tree. 
WINSTON Keep your head down, Tex. The Muj' got snipers too. 
CHRIS A sniper won't aim for your head. 
A DOZEN MARINES are posted outside an apartment complex. 
WINSTON They got this sniper that's been hitting headshots from 500 yards out-- 
46    INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX                                      46 
An open atrium eight stories tall. CHRIS and WINSTON walk past a giant pile of furniture and debris tossed down. 
WINSTON (CONT'D) --they call him "Mustafa." He was in the Olympics. 
CHRIS They got sniping in the Olympics now? 
They start up the stairs. 
46A   OMITTED                                                    46A 
47    INT. APARTMENT, SIXTH FLOOR                                 47 
Chris walks from APARTMENT TO APARTMENT, some vandalized, others untouched, checking sight-lines out windows. 
WINSTON (trailing Chris) What're we looking for? 
CHRIS You ever hunt? 
WINSTON I ain't that kind of red-neck. 
He unzips and peels off into the bathroom. 
WINSTON (OS) Fuck, fuck-- 
WINSTON FIRES TWO ROUNDS in the bathroom. Chris pulls a Springfield .45 as-- 
A GOAT 
Bounds out of the bathroom, runs out the apartment door and leaps OVER THE RAILING, falling six floors. 
RAILING 
CHRIS and WINSTON look down to the lobby, where Marines stand around the DEAD GOAT. 
CHRIS (laughing) You just got your first kill, Goat. 
He nudges Chris, trying to get a celebration out of him-- 
CHRIS Get the fuck off me. 
This is the reality of war. Not like he anticipated. 
CLOSE ON CHRIS 
Breath racing. Bleeding sweat. Trying to process his disgust. Trying to inject some purpose, mumbling: Protect the Marines. Protect the Marines. Protect... 
Clouds crawl over Chris like ghosts, swirling feverishly as HOURS SLIDE BY. His face takes on a preternatural blankness as he begins to slip into the shadows of self. 
Suddenly-- clouds halt, pupils flare, chest inflates. 
49   EXT. ELIZABETH STREET - SAME                                49 
Sun flares as MARC LEE advances alongside 1ST PLATOON MARINES (40 men) when-- A SHOT SOUNDS. A BODY TUMBLES out of the sky and lands in their midst with a meaty thud. 
1ST MARINE #1 -Fuck, man! What the hell-- 
The Marines duck for cover then look to the sky-- 
1ST MARINE #2 -Where'd it come from? 
MARC LEE That's your overwatch, Einstein. You can thank him later. Keep moving. 
Marines slowly return to standing, glancing up at surrounding structures trying to spot their protector. 
50   INT. WINDOW - LATE AFTERNOON                                50 
Chris lays atop a baby crib. A scrim hangs in front of him. Sunlight burns through it, casting a thousand pinpricks of light across his face. SUN MARCHES ACROSS the sky and pixels twist over his cataleptic shape. 
Suddenly-- sun halts, chest inflates, eyes flare. 
51   INT. STREET - SAME                                           51 
A CAR SPEEDS toward 1ST PLATOON. MARINES open fire with the feeble POP-POP of M4s. The car still coming-- 
A SNIPER SHOT BOOMS across the sky like thunder. The windshield spiders, blood splattered, and the car stops. 
As Marines search rooftops for him-- THE CAR EXPLODES. 
52   INT. LOOTED ROOM, ELIZABETH STREET - EVENING                 52 
CHRIS plants a loop-hole charge at the base of the wall and steps around the corner to trigger the charge. 
CUT BETWEEN: 
INT. HALLWAY, DOWN ELIZABETH STREET - SAME 
Black robes draw across mosaic tiles as   "PHANTOM SNIPER" slips down a hallway. A Dragunov Sniper   Rifle over shoulder, he hears the loop-hole charge   detonate nearby and turns, entering a tiled washroom to   his left. 
This is "MUSTAFA". 
LOOTED ROOM / CHRIS 
CHRIS lays his kit in front of the blast-hole: gun, flag, Bible. Packs a dip, elbows meet cement, eye meets glass-- 
WASHROOM / MUSTAFA 
MUSTAFA lays in front of a mortar-hole. In a leather satchel: ammo, oil, cell phones. His eye meets glass-- 
LOOTED ROOM 
CHRIS finds his stillness. The instant he does-- SHADOWS CREEP over him and night swallows the room. 
53   EXT. ELIZABETH STREET - NIGHT                                53 
A palm tree burns like a candle over Fallujah. Below it, head-lamps dance chaotic as VIPER TEAM MARINES exit a house spray-painting "X" on the gate. 
MARINE VIPER #1 --hot as Bigfoot's ballsack over here. (knocks on next gate) Derka, derka, derka.... 
MARINE VIPERS laugh, bowling into a courtyard. 
CHRIS SCOPE POV (N/V) 
Glowing green hue. CROSS-HAIRS track the Marines entry, sweep the street and push toward the rooftop, when-- 
A SHOT SOUNDS. A MARINE FALLS in a 2nd story window. 
MARINE VIPER #4 (OS) (over radio) --Fuck! Man down! It came through the window-- 
CROSS-HAIRS whip across rooftops, on a swivel. 
CHRIS (OC) That was sniper fire. Shooter is on our side of Elizabeth street. Over. 
MARINE VIPER CO (OS) Negative. East side of Elizabeth is locked-down. Over. 
Viper Marines drag the soldier out. In the phosphorous green glow, we watch his body tremor as he dies. 
SFX: CHRIS' ELEVATED HEARTBEAT pounds over scene as-- 
WASHROOM 
MUSTAFA flees down the hall. A fluttering shadow in darkness, except for the reflective swoosh on his Nikes. 
LOOTED ROOM 
CHRIS By every kill, do you mean just our kills or you're monitoring the bad guys too? 
JAG OFFICER #2 Your scores at sniper school were average at best, then you get here and you're just lighting the world on fire? 
Chris opens a PLASTIC WATER BOTTLE, sips it, waits-- 
CHRIS Sorry, was that a question? 
OVERWATCH 
Chris takes over for a MARINE SNIPER in a window. 
MARINE SNIPER Haven't seen shit all day. Maybe the war is over and they forgot to tell us. 
Chris settles in, still going through his ritual when AN INSURGENT crosses the street with CAR BATTERY and AK-47. 
CHRIS (keys mike) I got a armed military-aged male moving tactically with a car battery. Maybe he needs a jump? 
COMMANDING OFFICER (OS) (over radio) Negative. Bomb maker. Green-light. 
Exhale, pause, pull. A SHOT RINGS OUT. 
MARINE SNIPER (OS) (just offstage) --are you fucking serious? 
MARINE INTEL TRAILER 
CHRIS scrunches that EMPTY WATER BOTTLE, gratingly, as JAG OFFICERS continue the interrogation: 
JAG OFFICER His wife said he was carrying a Koran. 
CHRIS Well, I don't know what a Koran looks like but I can describe what he was carrying-- it was pressed metal, fired 7.62s and looked just like an AK-47. 
MESS HALL 
CHRIS, BIGGLES, D and DAUBER enter. Eyes find them, heads nodding to Chris, that the guy? Word spreading. 
Biggles sees it, hops up on a chair-- 
BIGGLES Listen up ladies and genitals. The Legend here would like you to know that when it comes to sniping it's better to be lucky than good! Our boy here has a Texas horseshoe crammed so far up his ass that-- 
Chris flings a cafeteria tray at his head. 
56   EXT. ROOFTOP - DAWN                                         56 
In murky predawn light, CHRIS sits on a SATELLITE PHONE-- 
TAYA (OS) Have you killed anyone yet? 
CHRIS That's not how the call-home goes, babe. 
TAYA (OS) Don't be weird with me. Seriously. I want you to tell me everything. 
Chris covers the phone as distant gunfire chatters. 
INTER-CUT WITH: 
57   INT. CHRIS & TAYA'S HOUSE, SAN DIEGO - SAME                 57 
TAYA sits in front of a partially assembled baby-crib with a six month baby bump. She turns down the TV. 
CHRIS There are things we can't say over the phone. 
TAYA (playful) You knocked me up and now I'm stuck here by myself assembling baby-cribs and you can't talk to me? That's the big plan? 
HIS CROSS-HAIRS track across a distant rooftop. Socks sway from a clothesline in a 5 knot breeze. 
TAYA You guys almost done over there yet? 
CHRIS I can't stop thinking about that pink silky thing you wore on our honeymoon... 
TAYA It's called a nightgown. 
CHRIS Yeah-- 
TAYA And three days is not a honeymoon. 
CHRIS It was a good three days. I miss you bad. 
TAYA (curls up in chair) You want me to talk dirty to you? 
CHRIS Yeah. But I got my gun in one hand and the phone in the other-- 
TAYA Well, you'll just have to decide what's more important. 
CHRIS You're horny preggers. 
TAYA Fat and horny. It's kinda disgusting. 
CHRIS You could be 300 pounds I'd still do you. 
She's touched, hormonal, starts crying. 
TAYA -So romantic. 
CHRIS How's my boy? 
TAYA Nobody said it's a boy-- 
AGENT SHEAD If we're humping money the head-shed will want contractors on it. (into phone) I'm here. What do you got? 
He listens a beat. His feet hit the floor. Eyes flick up. 
66   INT. HUMVEE #2 - TWO DAYS LATER                             66 
An object thumps beneath the tires. SECURITY CONTRACTORS wear baseball caps, Oakley blades and grizzled beards. 
CONTRACTOR Road-kill. 
They sit on benches opposite CHRIS and MARC LEE, a shrink- wrapped PALLET OF CASH between them. AGENT SHEAD sits closest the driver, playing big-dick with the mercs. 
AGENT SHEAD The Butcher is Zarqawi's enforcer. They say his weapon of choice is a drill. 
Chris looks to Marc Lee, eyes closed in prayer. When he opens them he sees Chris looking. The rig sways. 
MARC LEE I went to seminary school before I joined the Navy. Came close to being a preacher. 
CHRIS Why didn't you? 
MARC LEE I love to gamble, man. Love those dice. 
Their laughter is liberating. It bonds them. 
CHRIS My kind of preacher. 
MORE LAUGHTER. A PHONE RINGS. Chris digs out a SAT PHONE. 
MARC LEE It's like that now, huh? 
CHRIS KYLE You haven't heard? I'm The Legend. (laughs at self; into phone) Hey babe-- 
TAYA (OS) You were right, doctor says it's a boy. 
CHRIS KYLE It's a boy! 
MARC LEE Hell yeah. Congratu-- 
WHAAP! Windshield spiders. CONTRACTOR/DRIVER'S brains spackle them. THE HUMVEE CRASHES into a storefront. 
RADIATOR HISSING, CONTRACTORS SCREAMING, "Call for backup" "Capel is down" "Dump the truck, cover us." 
67   EXT. MEDICAL PLAZA, SAN DIEGO - DAY                         67 
A crowded quad. TAYA, ON THE PHONE, stops in her tracks. 
TAYA Chris!-- 
EXT. CITY SQUARE/ STREET 
Looted shops, burnt awnings, colorful signage. MARC LEE and CHRIS pile out. THE SAT PHONE falls in the dirt. 
MARC LEE I heard one shot. 
CHRIS KYLE Check. Large caliber. Came in at an angle, gotta be 300 or more out-- 
They duck into a bomb-blasted storefront. They're looking downrange from the jagged orifice when-- A SHOT THUNKS into a painted Leo DiCaprio billboard overhead. 
MARC LEE (ducks back) He's all over us. You get a bead? 
CHRIS KYLE Negative-- 
AGENT SHEAD (OC) Transfer the pallet. We're pulling back. 
68   INT. DISTANT MINARET                                        68 
MUSTAFA sprawled on the balcony. PUSH past the swoosh of Nikes, up dark robes, along the cut of an unshaven cheek-- 
MUSTAFA SCOPE POV 
UNIQUE CROSS-HAIRS wobble past CHRIS and MARC LEE'S position to CONTRACTORS SCRAMBLING SHEAD into the street. Mirage boils straight up. A breath exhales-- 
69   INT. STOREFRONT                                             69 
A BULLET SMOKES through CONTRACTOR #1, ejecting half his vertebrae. CONTRACTORS SCRAMBLING-- 
CHRIS Minaret, 11 o'clock! 
AGENT SHEAD (from Humvee) There's no room. We'll come back for you-- 
Agent Shead and Contractors pull away in Humvee #2. 
An INSURGENT GUNNER steps from a door just uprange, BLASTING ROUNDS at the retreating vehicle. 
CHRIS You got eyes on that? 
MARC LEE Negative. 
Their cover prevents line-of-sight. Chris reaches his rifle out ADJUSTING A SIDE-MIRROR on the crashed Humvee-- 
UPRANGE (IN REFLECTION) 
THE BUTCHER drags OMAR from Sheikh Al-Obeidi's home by his hair. The boy's strange screams echo down the block as the Butcher revs a hand drill near his face-- 
CHRIS Eyes on The Butcher. He's got that Sheikh's kid in the street-- 
TWO INSURGENTS holds Sheik Al-Obeidi in the doorway as-- 
A FLUTTER of cloth sweeps across an alley a block north. MUSTAFA slows, rounding the corner, and glances back-- 
Chris draws his .45, but Mustafa slips into the shadows. Women sob over dead bodies in the street below. 
71   EXT. STREET - LATER                                         71 
TEAM THREE SEALs hold perimeter. The sheet draped over Omar is marked by a dozen blood spots. Chris is buzzing with remorse, looking to the minaret. 
CHRIS KYLE He had line-of-sight 500 meters out. 
BIGGLES Colonel Gronski is all over Marc, bro. 
In the distance, COLONEL GRONSKI barks at MARC LEE then climbs in a Bradley. As MARC approaches-- 
CHRIS We need to work up a squad to pursue him. 
MARC LEE They're shutting us down. 
CHRIS What do you mean? 
MARC LEE We're confined to base pending an incident review. 
CHRIS Can he do that? Just shelf us like that? I ship home in three weeks. 
Wind blows the sheet off Omar. 
BIGGLES It's gonna be a long three weeks. 
72   EXT. WEIGHT LIFTING CAGE, CAMP FALLUJAH, FOB - SUNSET       72 
Chris stalks the cage, shirtless and sweating. His eyes track the horizon as darkness falls on Fallujah. 
73   EXT. NORTH AIRFIELD, CORONADO, CALIFORNIA - NIGHT           73 
Halogen spotlights illuminate tarmac. SOLDIERS emerge from darkness, pushing toward their waiting families. FIND TAYA in heels, 9 months pregnant. Chris limps toward her. She walks into his arms and STARTS SWINGING fists. 
TAYA I thought you were dead. I thought-- 
He holds her close until her rage gives way to tears. 
CHRIS Shh. I'm know. I'm so sorry. 
They stand there long after everyone has gone. 
74   INT. BEDROOM                                                74 
Taya lowers the lights, steps out of her dress and looks at herself in the mirror, 9 months pregnant, and not sure she's sexy. Chris exits the shower, stops, staring-- 
CHRIS You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. 
TAYA I have an alien growing inside me-- 
She deflates and sits on the bed. He kneels before her. 
TAYA And there's a strange man in my bedroom. 
CHRIS Our bedroom. 
TAYA (pulls his ring off necklace) Why isn't it on your finger? 
CHRIS If it catches the light... 
He doesn't spell it out. She slips it on his finger. 
TAYA Your hands feel different. 
CHRIS They're mine. I swear... 
TAYA Why am I so fucking nervous? 
CHRIS (kissing her belly) I'm nervous too. 
TAYA No you're not. Don't lie. 
CHRIS I am... What if that little alien reaches out and grabs me? 
She laughs and squishes his cheeks, making faces with his face. 
TAYA Why are you so good with me. 
Her face opens in ecstasy. 
75   INT. BREAKFAST TABLE, CHRIS' HOUSE - MORNING                75 
CHRIS, showered, shaven and ill-at-ease, picking at the calloused "shooter's strawberries" on his elbows. 
TAYA (OC) --it might be nice to get out-- 
His coffee steams like smoke off a barrel. 
TAYA (OC) --are you listening to me? Chris-- 
CHRIS (knee pumping) Huh?-- 
A lawn-mower starts. His eyes track windows. Taya sees what's happening and-- she extends a naked leg into his sight line. His eyes follow her leg, to welcoming eyes. 
TAYA What do you want to do today, hon'? 
Taya grips his hand. Her WAILING SCREAMS fall silent and-- 
78   INT. DELIVERY ROOM                                          78 
Taya stares blankly at Chris. He thinks he lost her. Then-- A SMALL CRY breaks the tension. Taya gasps. 
THE BOY lands in Chris' arms covered in vernix and blood. 
CHRIS My little man... 
He holds him to the light and relief pours over him. 
CHRIS Look at our boy. Look what we did. (nuzzles close to her) I love you, baby. We made it-- 
He holds his family close as BEDOUIN MUSIC SWELLS-- 
FADE TO: 
A THERMAL IMAGE. Cross-hairs on MARINES emerging from tall grass. A SHOT FIRED. A MARINE FALLS. An Arabic sickle & sword appears over the image. We are-- 
79   INT. DEN, CHRIS' HOUSE, CORONADO, CA - NIGHT               79 
PAN ACROSS an Iraqi parcel on the coffee table. FIND CHRIS staring at the TV, livid, lit by Christmas lights. 
TAYA (OC) The baby is crying. I thought you were-- 
Chris lunges for the remote as another KILL SHOT PLAYS. 
TAYA Don't bother turning it off, I already watched it. 
He looks up at her, holding Colton. 
TAYA I had to make sure you didn't have an Iraqi girlfriend sending sexy videos. 
He lightens, touching her, eyes drifting back to the TV. 
CHRIS This sniper is recording his kills. Mustafa. They sell these in the street. 
TAYA That day we were on the phone-- 
Chris nods, it was him. 
TAYA You're not protecting me by not talking about it. 
CHRIS I don't want you thinking about it. I don't need you worrying. 
TAYA My imagination is so much worse than anything you could tell me-- 
CHRIS (cutting her off) No, it's not. They're savages. 
TAYA Chris-- 
CHRIS They're fuckin savages. 
His blood pressure pulses on his unyielding face.. 
TAYA It's not about them, it's about us. (hands him baby) You have to make it back to us. 
Her eyes trail off him as she steps into the kitchen. 
Chris holds his son, taken with his ruddy innocence. Then the BEDOUIN MUSIC swells, his arms tighten around his son, and his eyes are drawn back to Mustafa. 
"SECOND TOUR" 
80   EXT. AL TAQADDUM AIRBASE, IRAQ - DAY                        80 
The tail of a C-17 draws down. YOUNG MARINES file off leaving CHRIS, squinting into a dirty sunset as he tucks his ring away like he's stowing part of himself. 
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN (sharp-nosed, fit) Welcome home, Petty Officer Kyle. Colonel Jones is waiting. How was the flight? 
CHRIS KYLE Slower than Christmas. 
Chris is following him toward a Blackhawk when-- 
CHRIS Can you give me a second--? 
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN The colonel is waiting-- 
Chris is already striding across the tarmac toward-- 
A SQUAD OF MARINES 
Loading onto a C-17 weary, injured, heading home. JEFF KYLE doesn't see Chris until he has hands on him. 
CHRIS KYLE Hey, grunt-- 
Chris shakes him and pulls him into his arms. 
JEFF Chris? 
Jeff is slow to react, like he can't see past the atrocity branded on back of his eyeballs. 
CHRIS KYLE Y'alright? You in one piece? 
He looks him over, undamaged but for the eyes. 
MARINE LCPL Let's go, PFC Kyle. Move your ass. 
CHRIS KYLE You need to sit this one out? 
MARC LEE I just wanna believe in what we're doing-- 
CHRIS KYLE Evil lives here, we've seen it. 
MARC LEE It lives everywhere-- 
CHRIS KYLE You want to invite these motherfuckers to come fight in San Diego? Or New York? We're protecting more than this dirt. 
Marc adopts his zeal, letting it fill him. 
MARC LEE Hooyah then. Lets go kill this fucker. 
He bangs out. Chris is alone. Lightning in his bones.

87   EXT. STREET/NEAR FAHIMA HALAL - PRE-DAWN                 87 
Neon shimmers across wet empty streets. TEAM THREE trundle past shops largely unbombed. TONY checks his GPS-- 
TONY (whisper-mic, pointing) This building, any apartment on the east side, will look down Fahima Halal. 
88   INT. HALLWAY, 4TH FLOOR, BUILDING - CONTINUOUS             88 
TEAM THREE push to a door. Biggles has a cat-claw, ready to breach-- A BABY CRIES behind the door. Chris waves them off. Another door. 
CHRIS (whisper-mic) Breacher-up. 
BIGGLES is ready to wedge the cat-claw when he sees keys hanging from the door. He grins and simply opens it-- 
89   INT. CORNER APARTMENT, SIXTH FLOOR                         89 
A modest apartment. TEAM THREE have seated the family; A PROTECTIVE FATHER hugs his BOY(6) as his WIFE frets. 
CHRIS Tell em they won't be leaving till we do-- (hands Terp a photo) Ask if they seen him. 
TERP TRANSLATES, showing a PHOTO OF THE BUTCHER. 
LOOKING OUT WINDOW 
The RESTAURANT BELOW is boarded up with painted metal. 
BIGGLES (Hall & Oates song) --Private eyes, we're watching you, watching your every move... 
"D" Why a restaurant? 
MARC LEE Big freezers. 
Marc turns away, leaving them to wonder. 
CHRIS Let's keep eyes on it get pictures of anyone coming and going. 
Biggles watches Chris collapse onto his ruck-sack. 
BIGGLES Fucking Chief Nappy-nap. 
A challenging smile. Chris flips him off. 
"D" Got some nice rugs up in here. (thumbs up to Father) This shit is hand-knotted. Beautiful. 
Surveillance rolling, Chris closes his eyes.

In darkness, CHRIS bolts upright then sees his guys by the window. He joins them. Despite rolling blackouts, light is visible around plywood on Fahima Halal windows. 
CHRIS What do we got? 
MARC LEE 16 military aged males have gone in. 
CHRIS Sixteen? 
BIGGLES They serve more customers than McDonalds. 
MARC LEE And check this. 
ON DIGI-CAMERA, ZOOMS ON PHOTO of The Butcher entering-- 
CHRIS He still inside? 
MARC LEE I'm only clocking one point of entry. He's in there, but it's no easy breach. 
BIGGLES When they see it's The Legend they'll probably just invite him in-- 
CHRIS You got a problem? I didn't promote myself. 
BIGGLES No, I did it for you. You'd never have made Chief if I nicknamed you "The Myth". 
TWO MEN in robes (TONY & BIGGLES) rush the door tossing grenades, pulling the father out as the GRENADES EXPLODE. 
CHRIS, MARC LEE and "D" push inside-- 
94   INT. FAHIM HALAL - NIGHT                                    94 
A smoky banquet hall. GUNFIRE lights from far wall. A man we recognize as THE BUTCHER is ushered through a doorway. 
CHRIS (keys mike) We have eyes on the target. Flushing them out the back-- 
IN THE ALLEY 
TONY and BIGGLES are posted in the alley, waiting. 
BIGGLES (keys mike) Negative. Nothing yet. 
BANQUET HALL 
CHRIS and COMPANY push through the doorway the Butcher passed through, but it's not an exit. It is-- 
KITCHEN 
An IRAQI MAN is hung up by a chain, the majority of his skin carved off, still alive. A walk-in freezer ahead. 
CHRIS (to "D") Help him-- 
MARC LEE (OC) Down here. 
Stairs lead down into darkness. Chris follows him into-- 
AN UNDERGROUND TUNNEL 
A naked bulb illuminates a tunnel stretching to darkness. 
CHRIS (realizes; keys mike) They're coming back up! Watch your six-- 
THE TUNNEL DETONATES. Dirt and debris explode at them. 
BACK ALLEY 
BIGGLES and TONY are posted up. The RADIO STATIC-- 
BIGGLES --I can't hear you. Say again. 
BEHIND THEM 
TEN INSURGENTS pour out of another building, circling back toward Biggles and Tony. 
KITCHEN 
CHRIS and MARC LEE bowl in, panicked, covered in dirt. 
CHRIS KYLE Move. 
"D" turns from a WALK-IN FREEZER full of bloody parts. 
"D" Big freezers. (sickened, following) Fuck-- 
SNIPER NEST 
DAUBER SEES INSURGENTS approaching Biggles-- 
DAUBER Biggles! Watch your six. Roadies on you-- 
He starts downing them but more seep out downrange. 
BACK ALLEY 
BIGGLES and TONY are banging away but outgunned when CHRIS, MARC LEE and "D" steps out, laying down fire. 
CHRIS Pull back! Loading-- 
BIGGLES Got you. 
Biggles is slaying combatants. Precise and deadly. 
BIGGLES RPG! 
AN RPG burns down the alley, screaming between them and EXPLODES INTO SNIPER NEST. As dust clouds the night-- 
THE BUTCHER 
Slips through smoke, shooting his way to a getaway truck. 
CHRIS Contact. Eyes on The Butcher. 12 o'clock. 
MORE INSURGENTS, push up the alley, covering him. 
CHRIS (keys mike) Dauber? You got visual? Confirm. 
SNIPER NEST 
Dauber struggles from under debris. 
DAUBER Negative. No shot-- 
CHRIS 
CHRIS' LONG FINGERS pressed to the glass. SFX: his breath rattles quietly over following scenes. We are-- 
98   EXT. MATERNITY WARD, SAN DIEGO                              98 
CHRIS stares into the nursery window where his NEWBORN DAUGHTER CRIES. The air thick and dreamlike around him. 
TAYA (VO) The news is saying the war is over. 
CHRIS (VO) It's not over. 
TAYA (VO) But are we winning? 
CHRIS (VO) I don't know... 
TWO NURSES walk past his daughter. Chris bangs on the glass, trying to get their attention. 
CHRIS Hey, some help here-- She's crying-- 
He pounds the glass. The nurses don't hear him. SFX: THE MECHANISTIC BUZZ of power-tools overwhelms the scene-- 
TRANSITION TO: 
99   INT. JIFFY LUBE - DAY                                       99 
PAN ACROSS GUMBALL MACHINES and TOY DISPENSERS on the wall. The POWER TOOLS whining as COLTON(3) holds a toy, pissed it's not the one he wanted. 
COLTON But I want that one-- 
CHRIS (the air still thick, his words spoken from afar) You don't get to choose, bubba. 
COLTON But I don't like it! I want that one-- 
THE DRILL BUZZES in the garage. Chris' nerves fraying. 
CHRIS You get what it gives you. That's how this thing works. 
Colton melts to the floor crying. CUSTOMERS looking now. 
CHRIS Don't do this. Get up. Come on-- 
THROUGH VIEWING WINDOW-- THE MAN with the drill is visible. Dark hair like The Butcher, turning toward us-- 
RECEPTIONIST (OC) Chris Kyle, your truck is ready. 
CHRIS (snaps-to; to Colton) Get off the floor. Right now-- 
MAN'S VOICE (OC) Excuse me, sir. 
A YOUNG MAN steps too close. Chris rears up, defensive. 
YOUNG MAN Are you... "Chief" Chris Kyle? 
CHRIS That's me. 
YOUNG MAN Sorry to intrude, sir, but we met in Fallujah. You saved my life. 
CHRIS Did I--? 
YOUNG MAN/VETERAN Yes, sir. My name is Mads. We were trapped in a house when you showed up with 1st Marines. You carried me out. 
CHRIS (lifetimes ago, but) Yeah. Right. Well, you Marines saved our ass plenty out there. How you holding up? 
MADS/YOUNG VETERAN Great, sir. I'm grateful to be alive. It hasn't been easy but-- 
He lifts his pant-leg and shows an ARTIFICIAL LEG. 
MADS It cost lots of guys more than a leg. 
CHRIS Did you lose some friends? 
MADS That too, but I'm talking about guys that lived. They made it back but they're just not back. They can't seem to get right. 
DRILL STARTS UP again. Chris glances that direction. 
CHRIS Yeah, I-- I'm sorry to hear that. 
MADS You should come down to the VA sometime. The guys would love it. They all know who The Legend is. 
Chris nods like he never will. Mads kneels to Colton. 
MADS I bet you missed your daddy when he was gone. But can I tell you something? Your dad is a hero. He saved my life-- (eyes well up) He helped me get home to my little girl. 
Colton looks up at his dad who swells with emotion. OTHER CUSTOMERS watching now, captivated. 
MADS So thank you for loaning him to us, li'l man. I wouldn't be here without him. 
Mads stands and comes to attention, saluting Chris. 
MADS My family thanks you for your service. 
Chris bites back emotion, nods, and walks out. 
100   INT. NURSERY                                              100 
A pink cocoon of a room. Taya sits in a rocker, breast- feeding their daughter, MCKENNA. She's gentle, imploring-- 
TAYA I'm making memories by myself. I have no one to share them with. 
102   INT. MUSTAFA'S APARTMENT - SAME                           102 
A dry hand spins   a SNIPER ROUND on a tabletop. It wobbles to a stop facing   the man who set it in motion-- MUSTAFA, head-on. A messy   beard and thousand-yard stare. Haunted but unrelenting,   he spins the round again. 
An IRAQI WOMAN appears, shushing an infant. She says something to Mustafa but he doesn't respond. A phone vibrates. He grabs a duffel and steps out. By the door, A PHOTO OF MUSTAFA on a medal stand at the Olympic Games. 
103   INT. UNDERCOVER TRUCK                                     103 
Biggles speeds after the van, taking fire from above. 
CHRIS Get me a shot, grandma. 
Biggles stomps the accelerator, whips around a corner-- 
A SHORT STRAIGHTAWAY 
CHRIS BLASTS 200 ROUNDS (MK48) into the van; pulverizes the thing and watches it hiss to a stop. 
BIGGLES That should do it. 
COURIER bounds out of the van, diving into a building. 
CHRIS What the fuck!? How'd he survive-- 
BIGGLES Rubber junk-man's got your horseshoe. 
They roll out in pursuit. The Humvee pulls up. Inside-- 
"D" (into mike) --need a two block perimeter around the area. No one gets in or out. 
104   EXT. DISTANT ROOFTOPS                                      104 
MUSTAFA crosses rooftop-to-rooftop with fluency. 
105   INT. HALLWAY, APARTMENT COMPLEX                            105 
BLOOD DROPLETS lead to a door. Biggles kicks-in. 
106   INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                                106 
Biggles and Chris dance around each other like smoke. 
BIGGLES Clear. 
An open window. Stairs climb the wall outside. 
CHRIS (keys mike) We're headed to the roof. Secure the van. 
THE VAN 
DAUBER and TONY cover MARC LEE and "D" as they open the back of the van. Inside, flats of RED CLAY TILES. 
"D" The Butcher is building a 7-11? 
Marc rips off the top layer, finds: 200,000 ROUNDS AMMO. 
MARC LEE No ammo, no jihad. 
ROOFTOP 
Drying sheets billow on crisscrossing wires. Chris tracks blood-drops to the ledge. The next roof 15 feet off. 
BIGGLES How the hell'd he make that? 
CHRIS He didn't-- 
Two stories below, COURIER lays face down in his mess. 
BIGGLES So much for leading us to the Butcher. 
CHRIS So much for him having my horseshoe. 
Chris pulls his mask down. He has a beard and the sturm und drang of war are writ loud on his face. 
DISTANT BALUSTRADE 
MUSTAFA lays prone, mumbles a prayer and takes two deep breaths before putting his eye to the scope. 
MUSTAFA SCOPE POV 
CROSS-HAIRS TACK to fluttering sheets, the wind revealed in their billow. TWO FIGURES are cloaked there, indistinguishable heads peaking over laundry lines. 
He aims left-and-above the head closest to him. 
ON THE ROOF 
Chris and Biggles stand among the billowing sheets. 
CHRIS She'll take it to Zales and try to find out how much your spent. 
BIGGLES She's not like that. 
CHRIS They're all like that. 
BIGGLES It's giant, bro. Four karats. It had to belong to one of Saddam's bitches-- 
Chris is laughing when he sees a FLASH OF GLASS in the distance. Before he can utter a warning-- 
112   INT. BRADLEY TRANSPORT VEHICLE                            112 
THE PUNISHERS. Ears pinned back. Metal blasting. Amp'd to kill. FIND CHRIS consumed by rage; he pulls the BIBLE and AMERICAN FLAG out and sets them aside. This is personal. 
MARC LEE Two clicks out. Lock and load. 
He glances at Chris, feeding off him. They all are. 
CHRIS For Biggles. 
IN THE STREET 
The tank skids to a stop. The turret spins to a castle- like structure and BA-BOOM! 
THE PUNISHERS pour out of their Bradleys, rolling in both directions, arcing toward the point of entry-- 
THE COURTYARD 
Punishers pour in. FOUR INSURGENTS lay dead, dispatched by the tank. Zero resistance. 
MARC LEE Courtyard is clear. Moving. 
CHRIS Some stronghold. Move. 
DAUBER and TONY follow them up a crumbled staircase-- 
LONG HALLWAY 
Ominously still. Sunlight spills through grated windows facing the street. Chris and Marc move to the first door-- 
FIRST ROOM 
A sleeping mat. A TV plays an Al Jazeeri game show. Marc pushes toward the bathroom, coming around the corner--- 
BATHROOM 
The faucet runs on a straight-razor. 
MARC LEE Clear. 
FIRST ROOM 
MARC steps back in, golden dust motes float around him. 
MARC LEE Somebody left in a hurry. 
CHRIS (keys mike) You sure we got the right address-- 
CANON-FIRE HITS the outer-hallway from across the street. Brrrrrb-Brrrrb!! Rounds banging with seismic force. 
DAUBER (OS) (from hallway) Fuck-- 
TIME SLOWS as Chris bounds toward the door. Marc Lee gets there first, steps through it, into-- 
LONG HALLWAY 
GUNFIRE RAINS through grated windows. The hall is coming apart in dusty chunks of plaster. 
DAUBER and TONY are pinned between windows. MARC LEE steps to the nearest window to lay suppressive fire. 
MARC LEE Contact-- 
GUNFIRE STRAFES IN AT AN ANGLE, HITTING MARC LEE IN HIS OPEN MOUTH. HE'S BLOWN BACKWARDS, HITTING THE WALL AND-- 
MARC LEE is down. Blood pooling. A forever stare. 
CHRIS Marc-- 
CHRIS is staggered but his training takes over and he steps into the same window, BLASTING FIRE. 
DAUBER is trying to intubate Marc but the back of his head is gone. He was dead before he hit the wall. 
THE ABRAMS TURRET SPINS. THE CANON BOOMS. THE EARTH TREMBLES AS THE BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET IS FLATTENED-- 
TRANSITION TO: 
The trembling is the turbulence. We are-- 
113   INT. C-17 GLOBEMASTER (IN FLIGHT) - NIGHT                  113 
In dim red-glow, FIND BIGGLES in a tented gurney, stable but critical; his head caved in. CHRIS stares ahead-- 
MARC LEE'S MOM (VO) "Glory is something some men chase and others find themselves stumbling upon." 
REVERSE TO MARC LEE'S CASKET draped in stars and stripes. 
114   EXT. FORT ROSECRANS NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY                114 
A pasture of tombstones overlook the Pacific. CHRIS, with a chest-full of medals, stands with TAYA, COLTON(4) and MCKENNA(2). TAYA watches MARC'S WIFE weep as-- 
MARC LEE'S MOM reads his LAST LETTER HOME: 
MARC'S LEE MOM "My question is when does glory fade away and become a wrongful crusade?" 
CHRIS HEARS MARC'S VOICE: 
MARC LEE (VO) "When does it become an unjustified means by which one is completely consumed." 
BIGGLES They say you're the deadliest sniper in U.S. Military history. 
CHRIS Is that what they say? 
Biggles grows quiet. 
CHRIS The bad guys fled up into to Sadr City. 
BIGGLES You're not going back? 
CHRIS We're gonna wall `em in and hunt `em down. 
BIGGLES You don't have to do this. 
CHRIS Yes I do. You're my brother and they're going to pay for what they did to you. 
His mind made up. Biggles moved by it. 
BIGGLES Hooyah, Legend. Hooyah--

124   INT. C-17 GLOBEMASTER -    DAY                            124 
75 Marines packed in. CHRIS hobbles up the isle like Achilles. His import draws the attention of soldiers he passes. He settles into a seat. Across from him-- 
MARINE LT. The Legend, right? I heard you killed 101 men your last tour. The hajis call you The Devil of Ramadi. 
Chris removes his wedding band, hangs it from his necklace. 
MARINE LT. So how many kills you got now? 
CHRIS KYLE You have to ask the Navy. I lost count. 
His reserve silences the Lieutenant. ENGINES ROAR as--

127   EXT. FOB COWBOY - DAY                                     127 
This base feels like a remote outpost. CHRIS and "D" walk past a boneyard of charred vehicles. 
"D" We been shot off position three nights in a row. Fallujah was bad, Ramadi was worse but this shit is fuckin biblical. 
CHRIS Any other Punishers here? 
"D" Squirrel cycled out. Dauber was coming back but his wife knocked him up. And if I bring home another rug my old lady'll murder my ass. Teams and shit. 
CHRIS (nostalgic) Teams and shit. 
"D" (a beat) That Biggles news hit hard. 
CHRIS I know. I visited him before I left. That fucker can't see shit. 
"D" (stops walking) Bro... Biggles is gone. He was in surgery yesterday and he died on the table. 
Chris stares at him, ruined, waiting for him to take it back. SFX: A PHONE RINGS thousands of miles away as-- 
CHRIS SCOPE POV 
CROSS-HAIRS track along Jamila street, past cranes assembling the T-wall that will stretch across the city. 
The phone stops ringing, VOICEMAIL picks up. 
TAYA VOICEMAIL (VO) -This is Taya, I can't get to the phone so please leave a message. 
A car pulls into an intersection, ominous in inactivity. Dust blows sideways off its halted tires. 
CHRIS MESSAGE (VO) It's me. I'm just calling to hear your voice. I'm missing you guys. I been thinking about some things you said. 
The car disappears down a side-street. CROSS-HAIRS linger at that spot, knowing the routine. 
CHRIS MESSAGE (VO Tell the kids I love them. 
AN INSURGENT darts out, flips the sight-finder on an RPG. Mirage boils off the street, same as dust, 45 degrees. 
CHRIS MESSAGE I love you too. 
CROSS-HAIRS compensate left for windage. A SHOT RINGS OUT. Red mist. CROSS-HAIRS scan the sector, they won't leave an RPG. Finally, ANOTHER FIGURE runs out-- 
A YOUNG KID 
No older than Colton. He grabs the RPG, shoulders it. CROSS-HAIRS zero on him, center-mass. SFX: Chris' heartbeat bangs like a 800lb hammer. Not again. 
133   EXT. STREET, SIX BLOCKS NORTH OF T-WALL - DAY              133 
Stryker slows. Boots hit dirt, silently slipping into-- 
134   EXT. BANANA FACTORY, SIX BLOCKS NORTH OF T-WALL - DAY      134 
PUSH UPSIDE a five story building. Bombed-out walls reveal conveyors and fruit lockers inside. 
ROOFTOP 
An open rooftop, RANGER ONE is concealed under a vent as INSURGENTS pass in droves in the street below. 
RANGER ONE (OS) The streets are crawling. Hold your fire. 
Across the roof, "D" on a .50 BMG looking at the MILE- WIDE SANDSTORM pushing toward Baghdad. 
"D" Enter the fuckin sandman. 
CHRIS 
3rd floor. In a fruit locker. Breath racing. Hands tremoring. Electricity coursing through him. 
Gun pointed north, Chris searches nearby buildings for the sniper. PUSH BEHIND HIM, SIX-BLOCKS SOUTH to-- 
T-WALL 
A CRANE lowers a T-block. ARMY ENGINEERS guide it in. 
ENEMY CROSS-HAIRS ENTER FRAME (REVERSE ANGLE) 
ARMY ENGINEERS in the street signal success and ANOTHER ENGINEER scurries up the neck of the crane to release the chain. The cross-hairs track the MOVING ENGINEER and-- 
BOOM! A shot echoes across the landscape and TOPPLES THE ENGINEER from the crane. He lands dead in the street. 
CHRIS 
Hears it, pulls off the gun, looking behind him. 
CHRIS No-- (keys mike) It came from behind us. We went the wrong way. He's south of the wall. 
RANGER ONE (OS) (over mike) Doesn't matter. Hold your fire. We got uglies right below us-- 
Chris repositions himself, FACING SOUTH-- he lowers his eye to glass, bleeding sweat, aiming toward Baghdad. 
CHRIS SCOPE POV (BOTH EYES VIEW) 
CROSS-HAIRS track to distant rooftops. Everything wobbles and fumes. Trash blows, fronds sway, curtains flap, mirage boils-- all gusting different directions. 
Almost by accident, he lands on an IMPOSSIBLY SMALL SHAPE. Person? A bag of trash? Or nothing at all. As small as a pepper-flake inside the radius of his scope. 
CHRIS (OC) (into mike) I got something. 1900 yards out. 
RANGER ONE (OS) You can't even see that far out. Hold your fire. You'll expose us all. 
He twitches and wobbles off-target by a city block. 
"D" (OS) He's right, Legend. No bueno. 
CROSS-HAIRS tracking back, measuring between mil- reticals, calculating for distance. Back on target: 
CHRIS (OC) Correction. 2100 yards out. 
"D" That's a mile. Impossible shot. 
CHRIS (OC) (beat) It's him. 
ENEMY SNIPER HIDE 
THE SNIPER is covered in a black Hefty bag disguising his presentation, and identity. Ready to kill again. 
CHRIS (OS) (over radio) This is Charlie 7 Bravo. We have eyes on the target. Initiate QRF. Over. 
"D" (OS) Can you confirm it's him. 
ON CHRIS 
Trying to breathe it down, please god, breathe it down-- 
CHRIS (OS) He has eyes on our guys. 
RANGER ONE (OS) Quick Reaction Force is 20 minutes out. You will stand the fuck down-- 
Chris scoops dust off the floor and watches with his off- eye, as it blows off his palm and plumes outward. 
"D" It's your call, Chris.

CROSS-HAIRS track to the cluster of MARINE ENGINEERS. 
CHRIS' SCOPE POV 
CROSS-HAIRS wobble on the dark shape a mile away. 
"D" (OS) If you got it, take it. 
RANGER ONE (OS) Negative, negative-- 
RADIO GOES STATIC, he nods, it's done. 
MARINE SNIPER White-side! 
INSURGENTS crossing the gap. Chris pivots-- 
TRANSITION TO: 
DRONE FOOTAGE of Chris on the roof of the Banana Factory. Surrounding streets are filled with bad guys. We are-- 
135   INT. COMM-OP TENT                                          135 
Wind battling tent. MASTER CHIEF MARTIN stands over a NAVY DISPATCH OPERATOR, staring at the footage. 
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN Tell the pilot to turn it loose. 
DISPATCH OPERATOR looks up, realizing what's happening. 
136   EXT. F-18 HORNET                                           136 
PILOT looks to his wing as STINGER MISSILES engage. 
PILOT 3-4, copy that. 30 seconds out. 
ON THE ROOFTOP 
TWO DOZEN insurgents surround them on the rooftop. CHRIS waits till a guy gets right up on him and-- BAM! 
"D" You're up-- 
"D" trades the SATELLITE PHONE for Chris' Springfield. 
CHRIS --you got four rounds. 
In their exchange, an unspoken goodbye. Then-- 
Chris struggles to dial, hands shaking. IT RINGS. He squints north. RINGS AGAIN. F-18 rocketing toward him-- 
TAYA (OS) Hello? 
Chris is stunned. She answered. He's speechless. 
TAYA Hello? 
CHRIS (struggles) Hey baby-- 
TAYA Chris-- What's the noise? 
Wind howls. F-18 closing. 
TAYA I can't hear you-- 
CHRIS I'm ready to come home. I'm ready... 
She starts crying. The F-18 almost upon them. 
TAYA What's happening-- 
CHRIS --I'm coming home. Can you hear me? 
TAYA Chris-- 
F-18 seconds out. Chris looks up and sees-- 
THE SANDSTORM 
Has shifted. A tsunami of dirt is about to swallow them. 
F-18 RAPTOR 
THE PILOT flying into the storm. Sensors screaming. He can't hold his line. 4, 3, 2-- He pulls up early. 
ROOFTOP 
HELLFIRE MISSILES scream over the Banana factory and EXPLODE INTO the next building. Fire and dirt engulf them. The blast recedes but the sand-storm escalates. 
CHRIS Go, go, let's move-- 
He leads "D", RANGER ONE and FOUR OTHERS across the roof. They stumble past INSURGENTS, blinded by sand. 
STREET BELOW 
CHRIS and SQUAD stagger into HOWLING CHAOS, clinging to each other, trailing Chris as GUNFIRE POPS behind them. 
CHRIS (choking, into mike) Stryker-3, what's your location-- 
AN INSURGENT is blown right into them. "D" wrestles his gun away and beats him with it. 
CHRIS Hold there! We are 30 seconds out-- (pointing ahead) Go. Straight ahead. Go-- 
They run for their lives. Unable to see two feet ahead. Sand shredding their skin. Chris is struggling-- 
Squad passing him. Knees failing him. He can't keep up. 
INT. STRYKER 
THE GUNNER stares at REMOTE WEAPONS SCREEN when SIX FIGURES EMERGE from the dust. He's about to fire-- 
TAYA McKenna's about to lose that tooth and I'm worried she's going to swallow it. She said she'd let you pull it. But only you. 
His head falls. When he looks up-- 
COLTON'S BIRTHDAY PARTY UNDERWAY 
6 YEAR OLDS and PARENTS mill around but all WE HEAR-- 
TAYA (VO) (CONT'D) I wish you'd talk to me, Chris. 
COLTON AND TWO FRIENDS chase each other around the yard. 
TAYA (VO) (CONT'D) I just feel this dark space between us and I don't know how to reach you. 
THE SHEEPDOG jumps on the back of COLTON'S FRIEND. The boy goes down hard, gets up crying, running from the dog. 
The Sheepdog does it again. THE BOY FALLS AND HIS CRYING is cuts into scene. THE BOY'S MOM runs over. His back clawed up. 
BOY'S MOM Get him off! Get away-- 
Chris rips the dog off by its collar. The dog snaps at him and in an instant he whips out his .45 to shoot it. 
TAYA (OC) No! He's a puppy. He doesn't know! 
Chris looks up, bent with animus, and he's looking at the face of his children, their friends, and their parents-- 
They look at him, terrified. He releases the dog. Lost.

148   INT. VETERAN'S HOSPITAL - DAY                              148 
Harsh light. Water-stained walls. CHRIS looks beaten, afraid and dubious of this BUTTONED-DOWN DOCTOR. 
DOCTOR Maybe you saw things, or did some things over there that you wish you hadn't-- 
CHRIS That's not me. 
DOCTOR What's not you? 
CHRIS I was just protecting my guys. They were trying to kill our soldiers and-- I'm willing to stand before my creator and answer for every shot I took. (struggles) The thing that haunts me are all the guys I couldn't save. 
NAVY DOCTOR You want to save more guys, walk down any hall in this hospital. We got plenty soldiers that need saving. (pulls prescription pad) I'm going to recommend Zoloft and--

150   EXT./INT. REC ROOM                                         150 
CHRIS steps to a window looking in on TEN YOUNG VETERANS sitting around a TV; wounded, edgy, in need. A legless Marine with a jelly-roll face looks up; this is "WYNN". 
151   EXT. SHOOTING RANGE, UNIDENTIFIABLE LOCALE - DAY           151 
CHRIS kneels before WYNN (wheelchair) who's armed with a .300 resting on Chris' shoulder. Wynn takes aim, FIRES-- 
CHRIS How's it feel? 
WYNN Feels like The Legend is trying to fuck up my shot. Stay still, man. 
Gun on shoulder, Chris is calm, he's found peace. BAM! 
WYNN Bulls-eye, boy! Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back. 
Chris dusts himself off. There's healing here. 
WYNN Why you spend all this time with us? I know you got a family. 
CHRIS I heard you had a nice boot collection before the war and-- 
WYNN (laughs) Seriously man. Why do you do it. 
CHRIS We gotta take care of our own. 
Chris squints into the falling sun and time passes with-- 
LONG FADE: 
151A   EXT. ROADWAY                                             151A 
The black F350 roars past a "Welcome to Texas" sign on the interstate.

153    EXT. KYLE HOME - MIDLOTHIAN, TEXAS - DAY                   153 
A residential neighborhood. Texas flags wave from stoops. CHRIS and COLTON carry boxes inside. "MAX THE SHEEPDOG" bounds along with them and never leaves Chris' side. 
BEDROOM 
Chris enters to find Taya has placed his old COWBOY BOOTS at the foot of the bed. He takes a seat and looks down at the combat boots on his feet. He bends to unlace them--

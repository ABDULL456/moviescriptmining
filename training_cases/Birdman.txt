We hear a clock ticking. 
FADE IN: 
1    INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - DAY                  1 Close on the brilliant colors of a middle eastern rug, the center of what seems to be a makeshift "meditation" space. 
We slowly tilt up to discover the back of Riggan Thomson (55). He is in the proper `Lotus' position, dressed only in tight white briefs and he appears to be meditating deeply. And if all this seems a little odd, it becomes all the more so when you notice that he is levitating almost two feet above the floor. His breath is calm and measured... in and out... in and out. 
MAN (V.O.) How did we end up here? (Beat.) This place is a fucking dump. 
We begin to slowly move toward Riggan's back while his measure breathing continues. We see a clock on the wall, ticking. 
MAN (V.O.) Smells like balls. 
A slight twitch in Riggan's neck. 
MAN (V.O.) We don't belong in this shithole. 
A Skype call shatters the silence. Close on his back, we follow Riggan as he walks over to the computer and answers the call. On the computer screen appears Sam (21), in a pair of Levi's and a Led Zeppelin T-shirt. She has simple and striking good looks, with an edge in her voice and behind her eyes. She stands in a Korean Deli among the flowers, talking to Riggan through her iPhone. 
1A                                                                1A 
The Korean Store owner (50) stands in the background screaming at her the whole time. 
RIGGAN Sam, I can't-- 
(CONTINUED) 
SAM Dad? What kind of-- (Turning to Korean.) SHUT UP!!! (Back to screen.) What kind of flowers did you say you wanted? 
RIGGAN Alchemillas. Or something soothing that smells nice. Listen I can't-- SAM It all smells like fucking Kimchi! 
RIGGAN Then whatever looks nice. Anything but roses. No roses. 
KOREAN Flowers don't need you touch! They need you buy!!! 
SAM (Close into the screen.) I hate this job. 
And the Skype call is over. Riggan closes the laptop and leans forward trying to regain his calm. His reflection appears in the mirror, and for the first time we see his face. He has a dark goatee and his hair looks strangely abundant. There is a piece of paper on the mirror with the handwritten phrase "A thing is a thing, not what it is said of that thing." 
ANNIE ON SPEAKERS Riggan, they're starting scene five. We need you on stage. 
RIGGAN Shit... Riggan throws on a sweater and stumbles into his slacks. He hurries out... 
2   INT. HALLWAYS - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            2 
...through the narrow corridors of the theater. There is a lot of activity as various workers and stage hands appear and disappear carrying equipment and scenery. As Riggan descends the stairs, a Stage Hand· passes by in the opposite direction. 
STAGE HAND· Mr. Thomson. 
(CONTINUED) 
RIGGAN Steve. 
STAGE HAND· It's Daniel. 
RIGGAN (Already passed.) Okay. 
Riggan continues on until he arrives backstage. He runs into Jake (42) his producer and friend. 
JAKE How's it going, buddy. 
RIGGAN Great. It'd be even better if I could get Ralph to stop acting like he's in an educational video for syphilis... The camera moves off of them and onto... 
3   INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                              3 ...the stage. Suddenly we are in the midst of an Americana style kitchen. 
Around the kitchen table sit Lesley (35), plain and no nonsense, her simple hairstyle and makeup can't hide how attractive she is. Laura (35), dark, exotic, the kind of woman who makes every person she meets feel like she's seducing them. And Ralph (40), slightly handsome, slightly balding, slightly invisible. 
CREW MEMBER Grab his legs. I got the top. 
JAKE Don't move him! Wait for the ambulance. (Calling out.) For the love of God! I could get a black audience in this theater faster than a doctor! 
Riggan heads off the stage, and Jake chases after him. We follow them as... 
4   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                           4 
...they walk through the corridor. 
JAKE Where are you going? We'll have the understudy ready to rehearse in five-- (CONTINUED) 
RIGGAN Forget the understudy. We have to postpone the preview. 
JAKE What are you-- It's a full house. We would have to refund all the-- 
RIGGAN Then do it. A crew member· passes in the opposite direction. 
CREW MEMBER· How's Ralph? 
RIGGAN He'll be fine. 
JAKE Wait. Wait. Fuck. Wait. RIGGAN Listen to me. It was going to be a disaster. That guy's the worst actor I've ever seen. The blood coming out of his ear was the most honest thing he's done so far. 
JAKE He's not that bad. 
Riggan stops in his tracks and stares at Jake. 
JAKE (CONT'D) Okay, he's fucking horrible. But-- 
Riggan starts walking again. 
JAKE (CONT'D) You have the press in your dressing room in a few hours. How are we-- RIGGAN I'll make something up. 
Two Technicians· hurry up in the opposite direction. 
RIGGAN (CONT'D) Jake. This happened for a reason. It wasn't an accident. 
JAKE What do you mean? 
(CONTINUED) 
RIGGAN I-- (A beat.) I made it happen. 
JAKE Oh. Okay. (Beat.) Are you drunk? 
RIGGAN Find me an actor. A good actor. Philip Seymour Hoffman... JAKE He's doing the third Hunger Games. 
RIGGAN Michael Fassbender? 
JAKE Doing the prequel to the X-Men prequel. They arrive at Riggan's dressing room. 
RIGGAN What's his name? Jeremy Renner... 
JAKE Who? 
RIGGAN The... the Hurt Locker guy. 
JAKE Yeah. He's an Avenger. 
RIGGAN (With disgust.) Fuck. They put him in a cape, too? (A beat.) Look, I don't care. Find me someone. Riggan enters... 
5   INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS            5 
...his dressing room and tries to shut the door. Jake, still in the corridor, stops it with his foot. 
JAKE (Sticking his head in.) Ralph'll sue us. He'll sue us. And he's got a case. 
(CONTINUED) 
Riggan releases the door. 
RIGGAN Then make him go away. 
JAKE How do you suggest I do that? 
CLARA Hang on. Who's this Barthes guy? Which Birdman was he in? 
GABRIEL Roland Barthes was a French philosopher, who-- CLARA Oh. Okay. Sure. Now, is it true you've been injecting yourself with semen from baby pigs? 
RIGGAN What? 
CLARA As a method of facial rejuvenation. 
RIGGAN Who told you that? 
CLARA It was tweeted by... (checks her notes) @prostatewhispers. 
RIGGAN It's a lie. 
CLARA I know. But did you do it? 
RIGGAN No! 
GABRIEL Are you afraid at all that people will say you're doing this play to battle the impression that you're a washed-up super hero? 
RIGGAN No. I'm not. And that's exactly why 20 years ago I refused to do Birdman 4. 
HAN Birdman 4??? You do Birdman 4??? 
Jake opens the door and the camera pans to him. 
(CONTINUED) 
JAKE Okay. That's enough for today. Thank you for coming. We're expecting some great pieces from you... 
Riggan stares at the Birdman poster. 
JAKE (CONT'D) Publicity guys are trying to get you a Times feature. Riggan stands up and pulls the Birdman poster off of the wall. 
JAKE (CONT'D) So, How'd it-- Whoa. If I were you I wouldn't do that. 
RIGGAN I don't want to look at it anymore. JAKE That was a present from the crew. Don't fuck with those guys, they're union. 
RIGGAN I don't care. 
Riggan leaves the poster on the floor, facing the wall, and walks to the window. He opens it. We can hear distant drums coming from the street. 
JAKE So... How'd it go? 
RIGGAN Great. 
JAKE (Worried.) Did they ask about Ralph? 
RIGGAN Nope. 
JAKE Good. He did it, you know? The motherfucker threatened to sue us. Didn't even wait to get out of the hospital. 
RIGGAN And, what did you say? (CONTINUED) 
JAKE What'd I say? I said, "You motherfucker. You're threatening me? ME? I swear to god, you fuck, I so much as get a letter from a lawyer, the press'll get the pictures we got off your computer." 
RIGGAN What pictures? JAKE The guy has a thing for nuns... in diapers. What do you care? You shouldn't have any knowledge about it anyway. The important thing is that I made him go away. 
RIGGAN Right. That's great. JAKE Yeah, it's fantastic. One problem. We don't have an actor. And if we cancel the first preview the press will smell the blood. We can't afford to lose any more money. At all. 
RIGGAN What do you want me to do? 
JAKE We pay an understudy, let's use the understudy. 
RIGGAN No. 
JAKE No? Riggan, listen to me. Our dream actor is not going to knock on that door and say: "Hey fellas, when do we start?" 
B5                                                                  B5 
There is a knock at the door. Leslie peeks in. 
LESLIE Can I talk to you for a second? 
RIGGAN Yeah. What's up? 
MIKE (O.S.) Intimidating. Isn't it? 
Riggan sees Mike Shiner (39) coming down the aisle, slovenly dressed with mussed hair and intense eyes. 
MIKE (CONT'D) Do you have any idea who walked these boards before you? (Beat.) Geraldine Page, Marlon Brando, Helen Hayes, Jason Robards... And now you. Riggan Thomson. 
Riggan, trying to hide the intimidation. 
RIGGAN Thanks for coming on such short notice, Mike. I appreciate it. 
MIKE Hey. This is what we do. (Indicates a script.) So, you wrote this adaptation? 
RIGGAN I did. 
(CONTINUED) 
MIKE And you're directing the adaptation and starring... 
RIGGAN I am. 
MIKE Ambitious. 
RIGGAN Thank you. 
A sly smile from Mike. He leaps onto the stage. 
MIKE Why don't we do a bit of it? 
RIGGAN Hey, I wasn't expecting you to-- MIKE First preview is tomorrow, right? 
RIGGAN Yeah, but you can go on with the script until you feel comfortable-- 
MIKE Let's just do some of it. 
Riggan tries to hide his excitement. He grabs the script from a nearby table and walks it over to Mike. 
RIGGAN Take a look at page twenty-- 
MIKE Yeah. I don't need that. 
RIGGAN What? 
MIKE I don't need the script. Just give me a cue. 
RIGGAN What are you talking about? 
MIKE Feed me a line. 
RIGGAN I don't-- What? (CONTINUED) 
MIKE Feed. Me. A line. 
Riggan drops the script and begins the scene. 
RIGGAN "I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't know the man. I've only heard his name mentioned in passing. I wouldn't know. You'd have to know the particulars. But I think what you're saying is that love is absolute." 
Mike stares at Riggan, hyper-focused. 
MIKE (Ruminating.) Am I saying that love is absolute? (He transforms.) "Yeah. The kind of love I'm talking about is. The kind of love I'm talking about you-- (An intense pause.) Well, you don't try to kill people. 
Riggan is transfixed, and almost immediately intimidated. 
RIGGAN How do you know the lines? 
MIKE I have a thing, a whatever, a gift. (A beat.) Come on, I helped Lesley get off book. Hey, give me that cue again. 
RIGGAN "I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't know the man. I've only heard his name mentioned in passing. I wouldn't know. You'd have to know the particulars. But I think what you're saying is--" MIKE Okay, can I-- Do you mind if I-- 
RIGGAN No, go ahead. 
MIKE Follow me. He says, "I'm the wrong person to ask." What's his intention? Is he fed up with the topic? Deflecting? Guilt about his wife maybe? Then four sentences all say the same thing... "I didn't even know the man." (MORE) (CONTINUED) MIKE (CONT'D) "I've only heard his name mentioned in passing." "I wouldn't know." "You'd have to know the particulars." First of all, particulars? What are you, my grandmother? But the point is, YOU DON'T KNOW THE GUY, WE FUCKING GET IT. Make it one line. "I didn't even know the guy." Right? ... 
RIGGAN You pretty much know my lines too, huh? MIKE Can we-- Are we doing something here? Come on let's go. Cut it down, give it to me again. 
RIGGAN "I'm the wrong person to ask--" 
Riggan stops. Silent. A beat. 
LAURA (CONT'D) Is that good or bad? (He stares at her.) Riggan...? 
RIGGAN It's good. It's great. She smiles, her eyes filled with emotion. Riggan smiles back, and nods absently. 
LAURA Say something else... 
(CONTINUED) 
RIGGAN (Joking.) You're pretty sure it's mine? 
LAURA (Unamused but plays along) Well, let's see. There's you. Jake. That masseuse wore a condom so... Yes, it's yours... idiot. 
She puts her head on Riggan's chest. We see his mind racing. Laura is moved, and confused. 
LAURA (CONT'D) Are you excited? 
RIGGAN Yeah. 
LAURA Me too. Laura moves slightly away from him and suddenly slaps him across the face. Riggan looks at her, confused. 
RIGGAN What--? 
LAURA You're not funny. 
She kisses him intensely on the lips and briefly places his hand on her belly, then moves it up to her breasts. After a moment, she backs away. 
LAURA (CONT'D) First preview tomorrow. Here we go! 
Laura turns and walks away. Riggan continues down the corridor. He passes by a Security Guard· in front of a small TV. The camera becomes Riggan's POV and advances until... 
11   INT. BACKSTAGE - THEATER - EVENING                             11 
...we go through the stage door. We scan the backstage area to see the stagehands ready to do their jobs. We can feel the electricity of a first preview. 
On stage part of the kitchen set from before is visible. Annie stands at her podium, calling the cues for the show. 
ANNIE (Into her headset.) Cue 34 and 35. Go. (CONTINUED) 
She turns and looks directly into the camera. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) Places. 
RIGGAN (O.S.) Okay. 
Riggan walks on screen wearing his costume, carrying a bucket of ice and a bottle of gin. He goes to the opposite side of the stage and takes his place in the wings. He peeks out at the audience who seem to be watching with interest. 
Then we pan to the stage to find Mike, Lesley and Laura performing the scene we saw at the beginning, around the table. Mike looks comfortable, sipping at his drink. A half empty bottle of gin on the table. 
MIKE The maniac shot himself right in front of us. I rode with him in the ambulance to the hospital. 
LESLEY I'll never get that image out of my head. Right before he did it, his eyes-- they were so sad... lonely. 
LAURA Did you have to treat him? 
MIKE I didn't have to. But I did. (Pouring another drink.) He was in bad shape. His head swelled up to like twice the size of a normal head. I'd never seen anything like it. And I swear to God, I hope I never do again. 
Riggan stands near Annie. RIGGAN He's good. 
ANNIE He's incredible. I think he's drinking real gin. 
Riggan looks out at Mike, who is refilling his glass. 
RIGGAN What? 
(CONTINUED) 
A stagehand gives Riggan a bottle. Riggan watches and waits for his cue. 
MIKE Ask Nick what real love is. He'll agree with me. You watch. 
LESLEY Why don't we just head to the restaurant? LAURA Don't get him started, Mel. You haven't seen how he's been lately. He's been depressed. I'm worried about him. He's been-- 
She gently pushes Riggan and we follow him on stage... 
Riggan keeps walking up to... 
13   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          13 ...the hallway. Jake chases him. 
RIGGAN I want him gone. 
JAKE No. 
RIGGAN What? 
JAKE We can't do that. 
RIGGAN What are you-- Of course we can do that. It's our show. 
(CONTINUED) 
JAKE Riggan, listen to me-- 
Riggan comes to a halt and faces Jake. 
RIGGAN No. You listen to me. Get him the fuck out of my play. Did you see him out there? 
JAKE It was a preview! Nobody gives a shit about previews. Nothing matters until that old bat from the New York Times is sitting in that audience on opening night. 
RIGGAN We're getting rid of him. I'm not going to stand up on that stage and-- 
JAKE Shut up! Just shut up for once and listen to me. As soon as we announced he was taking over, the advance doubled. We can't afford to lose a preview. We can't afford to lose money. We can't afford to lose Mike. This is about being respected, validated, remember? That's what you told me. That's how you got me into this shit. Now, you're the director. Get him under control. (A beat. As a friend.) These are not the nineties anymore. 
Jake storms away. Riggan heads toward his dressing room. Out of nowhere, Mike barrels into him, pinning him against a wall. 
RIGGAN (Startled.) Holy Fuck! 
Mike presses up against Riggan, breathing down his neck. After a painful silence... 
MIKE (Like he's possessed.) You were good... 
RIGGAN Meet me in front of the theater in 10 minutes. 
Mike chuckles and slaps Riggan gently on the face before he disappears into his dressing room. Riggan begins walking again. We follow him into... 
14   INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS             14 
...his dressing room. He goes into the bathroom and quickly washes his face. 
SYLVIA (O.S.) What the hell was going on up there? 
We pan over to see his ex-wife Sylvia (43), standing in one corner, staring at Riggan. She is elegant and simply beautiful. 
RIGGAN I didn't know you were here tonight. SYLVIA That guy's an asshole, huh? 
Riggan dries his hands with a towel and comes out of the bathroom. 
RIGGAN What are you doing here? SYLVIA Sam and I are going to grab a bite after she's finished with-- 
RIGGAN No, I mean here. Now. 
SYLVIA Well. I know how much this means to you, so-- 
RIGGAN I appreciate that. 
A beat. 
SYLVIA So, how's it going? 
RIGGAN The play? 
SYLVIA No, you and Sam. 
RIGGAN It's good. (A beat.) It's the same. 
SYLVIA Do you talk to her? 
(CONTINUED) 
RIGGAN We talk. We-- I don't know, it's been crazy around here. 
RIGGAN I will. 
SYLVIA You're not Farrah Fawcett, Riggan. She exits. Painful silence... until... 
BIRDMAN (V.O.) We should have done that reality show they offered us. "The Thomsons." That would've been good. Crazy, druggy, wise ass daughter. Milfy wife with the perky tits. People would have watched that. 
RIGGAN (To the poster.) Shut up. 
Riggan stands up and grabs his jacket. He opens the door and goes out to... 
15   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                           15 ...the hallway. 
BIRDMAN (V.O.) Where are we goin'? 
RIGGAN (Almost whispering.) Leave me alone. 
Riggan walks between crew members. Annie interrupts him. 
ANNIE The sun bed is here. 
RIGGAN What does that mean? 
ANNIE It means there's a sun bed out there being delivered to in here. 
RIGGAN Who ordered a sun bed? 
(CONTINUED) 
ANNIE Mike. He says it's for his character. Carver's red necks, "people of the land". Part of his process and that shit. 
Riggan cannot deal with this right now. He continues walking until he arrives at a metal door that takes him out to... 
16   EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - OUTSIDE THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS           16 
...an alley way. Riggan walks toward the street. There is a man playing drums. Riggan finds Mike leaning against a parked car, dazed and looking up at the marquis... 
RIGGAN Let's go. Walk. 
Riggan begins to walk, Mike follows. 
MIKE Where are we going? RIGGAN To get you some coffee. Have I done anything to disrespect you? 
MIKE Not yet. 
RIGGAN I have a lot riding on this play. MIKE Is that right? 
RIGGAN People know who I am, and-- 
MIKE Bullshit. 
RIGGAN Mike-- 
MIKE Bullshit. People don't know you. They know the guy in the bird suit. They know the guy who tells those quaint, slightly vomitous stories on Letterman. 
RIGGAN Well, I'm sorry for being popular, but that-- (CONTINUED) 
MIKE (With irony.) Popular? POPULAR?... Oh God, popularity is just the slutty little cousin of prestige. 
RIGGAN Okay, I don't even know what that-- 
MIKE My reputation is riding on this play. And that's... That is... RIGGAN A lot? 
MIKE A lot. Exactly. Fuck you. Yes. This doesn't work out for you, you get to go home to your studio pals and jump right back into that cultural genocide you guys are perpetrating. "There's a douchbag born every minute". That was P.T. Barnum's premise when he got rich inventing the circus. And you and your pals know nothing's changed, and whatever toxic shit you make people are still gonna pay to see it. But, after you're gone, I'll still be here. I'll still be making my living on the stage. Baring my soul. Wrestling with emotions, complex emotions. 
RIGGAN Right. Is that what tonight was about then? (Mocking him.) Wrestling with "complex emotions"? 
MIKE Tonight was about making it alive. About making it bleed. This isn't the Warner Brothers lot, Riggan. This is the city, and this is how we do things. 
Mike turns and opens the front door of The Rum House. 
RIGGAN Where are you going? 
MIKE They have coffee in here. 
He walks into the restaurant. Riggan backtracks and we follow him into... 
RIGGAN (CONT'D) Why is that funny? 
MIKE He wrote it on a cocktail napkin. 
(CONTINUED) 
RIGGAN So... 
Mike slides the napkin back to Riggan. 
MIKE He was drunk. 
A17                                                                 A17 
He walks away and we follow him as he passes by the bar next to Tabitha Dickinson, the Critic. 
TABITHA You headed to Hollywood, Mike? 
Mike stops. MIKE Hollywood's headed here, Tabby. 
TABITHA (A devilish smile.) Good luck with that. 
Mike looks directly into her eyes. 
MIKE "A man becomes a critic when he can not be an artist, in the same way that a man becomes an informer when he cannot be a soldier." Flaubert, right? 
He flashes his own devilish smile. She stares back. If she weren't so much older than him, you'd swear there was sexual electricity between them. 
TABITHA He's a Hollywood clown in a Lycra bird suit. 
MIKE Yeah. And at 8 o'clock tomorrow, he's gonna get on stage and risk everything. What're you gonna be doing? 
A standoff. 
TABITHA Don't you ever worry that I'll give you a bad review? 
(CONTINUED) 
MIKE Oh, I'm sure you will. If I ever give a bad performance. (Beat.) Ms. Dickinson. 
TABITHA Mr. Shiner. 
Mike smiles and waves over to an obviously nervous Riggan. He goes toward the exit, but we stay with Tabitha, scribbling on her notebook. Suddenly she raises her eyes and, with a dark expression, looks at Riggan who is passing by. 
We follow Riggan toward the exit. Through the window we see him leave the restaurant. Then we pan to a wooden wall, and this wall takes us to... 
19   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - LATER                               19 
...the theater hallway. Riggan walks through the quiet corridor, until he arrives at... 
20   INT. GREEN ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                       20 ...the Green Room. Sam sits listlessly, drawing some lines across a roll of toilet paper. 
RIGGAN What're you still doing here? 
SAM (Continues scribbling.) Nothing. I'm-- Nothing. Your costumes are hanging in your room. 
RIGGAN Great... 
SAM I got the coconut water you wanted. If you want me to get-- 
RIGGAN Hey. 
SAM What? 
RIGGAN I'm not sure if I said thank you. 
(CONTINUED) 
SAM For what? 
RIGGAN All of it. You've been doing a good job. And I've been... 
SAM Yeah. 
RIGGAN So, I just wanted to say that-- (He stops abruptly.) What is that? 
Three dancers on stage pass by in front of Laura. We follow the dancers backstage where we find Mike and Lesley wearing pajamas. LAURA (O.S.) (CONT'D) ...Not because I didn't love Nick. And not because I didn't love the-- The idea of it. But because I just wasn't ready to love myself. There's a certain distance to it all now. A wistful distance. Underscored by a gentle breeze and the sound of the birds... laughing at the whimsy of it all. 
A stage hand helps Mike and Lesley into a double bed. The camera slips under the covers with them and stays there. 
MIKE (Whispering.) Hey, Les... 
LESLEY (Whispering.) What? MIKE I'm hard. 
LESLEY No, you're not. It's just that sometimes you don't consider other people's feelings. 
MIKE No. I'm hard. Feel. 
(CONTINUED) 
LESLEY Oh, you gotta be kidding. 
The stage begins to revolve as we hear... 
22   INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            22 ...music through the transition. It remains dark. 
MIKE Let's really do this. Let's fuck. 
LESLEY Are you crazy? No. 
Mike rolls on top of Lesley. 
LESLEY (CONT'D) Cut it out... 
Mike continues to maneuver himself. 
LESLEY (CONT'D) I'm serious, Mike. Stop! 
MIKE I'm Mel. Not Mike. Mel. A knock on a door. 
RIGGAN (O.S.) Terri! Terri! 
A furious Lesley tries to reposition herself under Mike. 
RIGGAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) Terri! I know you're in there! 
The knocking gets louder. 
RIGGAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) Terri??? 
Mike, lost in his libido, has begun to have sex with Lesley. The camera comes out from under the covers and pans to Riggan who stumbles into what is now the Motel Room set. He wears a mustache and a long wig, that makes him look like a wild man. He holds a gun in his right hand. A neon "Motel" sign is illuminated. A clever effect of falling rain is visible behind the set, accompanied by the appropriate sound effect. Riggan is wet because of the "rain". 
Lesley uses Riggan's entrance to escape from Mike. 
(CONTINUED) 
LESLEY Ed! 
Mike hops out of bed, unaware of the very noticeable erection protruding underneath his pajama bottoms. 
Some laughter from the audience. 
LESLEY (CONT'D) What are you doing here? Lesley doesn't understand the audience response, until she notices the erection herself. 
RIGGAN (To Lesley.) Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for you. I worshipped you... 
MIKE Listen Ed, I know this is hard but-- More laughter. Riggan is disturbed, but he continues... 
RIGGAN (to Mike) Fuck you. Shut up. Fuck you. 
He shoves Mike violently to the floor. 
LESLEY Eddie! Please! 
Riggan points the gun at Mike's head. 
RIGGAN What's wrong with me? Why do I end up having to beg people to love me? 
LESLEY Ed. Eddie. Please... Give me the gun. She begins to cry. Her performance is beautiful. 
LESLEY (CONT'D) Just look at me. I was drowning. I was not capable of-- You deserve to be loved. You do. 
LAURA You're an actress, honey. 
Lesley begins to cry. Laura hugs her. LESLEY I'm pathetic. You know, I've dreamt of being a Broadway actress since I was a little kid. And now I'm here. And I'm not a Broadway actress. I'm still just a little kid. And I keep waiting for someone to tell me I made it. 
LAURA (Hiding how moved she is.) Hey. You made it. 
(CONTINUED) 
LESLEY I did? 
LAURA Sadly, it was with Mike Shiner, on a fake motel bed, in front of-- 
LESLEY (A little laugh.) Shut. Up. Riggan steps into the doorway and sees Laura hugging Lesley. 
RIGGAN Is she okay? 
LAURA She's gonna be fine. 
Riggan enters gingerly and walks up to Lesley. RIGGAN None of this is your fault. (Into her eyes.) You're beautiful. And talented. And I'm lucky to have you. Okay? 
LESLEY Okay. 
RIGGAN Okay. 
Riggan leaves the room. Laura leans on the makeup table. 
LESLEY That was very sweet. 
LAURA Yeah. Laura is suddenly teary. 
LESLEY What's wrong? 
A beat. 
LAURA (Smiling.) Nothing. Two years, he's never said anything like that to me. 
(CONTINUED) 
LESLEY (Into her eyes.) Hey. You're smart. And beautiful. And talented. And I'm lucky to have you. Okay? 
LAURA We're gross. 
LESLEY We are. Laura smiles and caresses Lesley's hand. They look at each other. Then Laura leans forward, close to Lesley's face... 
LESLEY (CONT'D) (Nervous.) What are you doing? 
LAURA Nothing. Laura kisses Lesley tenderly on the lips. Lesley seems confused. A few seconds of silence. Then... 
LESLEY Do it again. 
Laura kisses her again. A knock at the door. They separate. Mike opens the door holding the prop gun. 
MIKE (To Lesley.) Can we talk about this like two-- 
Lesley hurls the hair brush at his head. 
LESLEY FUCK YOU!!! 
MIKE Okay, well, you're not ready. Mike points the prop gun at her, pretends to fire and... 
MIKE (CONT'D) That was hot. 
He exits the room. We follow him... 
27   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          27 ...down the hallway up to Riggan's dressing room. Riggan sits at his table, picking the brains out of his hair. 
(CONTINUED) 
MIKE (Holding the gun.) Your gun is ridiculous. It looks like a plastic toy. And it still has the red plug in the barrel. (Shows the plug.) You look like a seven year old when you're holding it. I'm not threatened by it at all. 
He tosses the gun onto Riggan's table. MIKE (CONT'D) Have some self respect and get a new one. (Takes a step then turns.) That was a fun crowd, huh? 
We follow Mike to... 
28   INT. STAIRS - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          28 ...the stairs. He climbs them as he lights a cigarette. He goes through a metal door that takes him out onto... 
MIKE (Looking at the street.) There's a bald guy about to walk by down there. Spit on his head. 
SAM No! 
MIKE You said dare. 
SAM Truth. 
MIKE Too late. 
She stares into Mike's eyes, knowing she's being tested. She leans over the railing and spits down toward the street. SAM Happy? 
MAN (O.C.) (From the street) Fuck you! 
Sam laughs. Mike smiles at her carefree laugh. It could be the first time we've seen a genuine smile from him. 
SAM Truth or dare? 
MIKE Truth. 
SAM You're boring. MIKE Truth. 
She stares him down. 
SAM (Nervous, pretending.) Do you want to fool around with me? 
A pause. 
MIKE No. 
(CONTINUED) 
SAM (Taken aback.) Really? Why not? 
MIKE That's a second question. 
SAM It's a second part. 
A pause. MIKE I'd be afraid I couldn't get it up. 
Impressed with his honesty. 
SAM That didn't seem to be a problem for you on stage. MIKE Nothing's a problem for me on stage. 
SAM I wanna ask another question... 
MIKE You just asked-- 
SAM One more. 
MIKE Go 'head. 
SAM If you weren't afraid. What would you want to do to me? 
He carefully considers it, then moves his face close to hers. MIKE I would want to pull the eyes out of your head... 
SAM ...That's sweet... 
MIKE ...And stick them in my skull, and then look out at this street and see it the way I saw it when I was your age. 
(CONTINUED) 
Mike turns and stares out at the street once more. Sam stares at the mystery that is Mike. 
SAM G'night, Mike. 
She walks away and into the building, never looking back. 
A29                                                                A29 
Mike stares out into the night. We move to his POV. The street. Night turns to day. Pedestrians begin to walk below. 
B29                                                                B29 
We crawl down the wall until we arrive at Riggan's dressing room window. We push in to find... 
(CONTINUED) 
MIKE What the fuck is going on! 
RIGGAN Get up! 
MIKE Back away. 
RIGGAN Get up. Riggan slaps Mike on the arm. 
MIKE Ow, fuck that hurts! 
RIGGAN So, Carver is the reason you became an actor? MIKE What? 
RIGGAN This is my play! I did the work. I raised the money. I arrange the press. 
MIKE They called me for an interview. I said-- I don't know, I said the first thing that came to mind. Jesus, we got the cover of the Arts section! 
RIGGAN You said the first-- Fuck the Arts section. The first thing that came to mind? Right. Cause that's you. Mr. Natural. Mr. Fuck the scene, just stare at my massive hard-on. Because that's the truth of the moment. MIKE You think it looked massive? 
RIGGAN Shut up. Shut the fuck up. You don't get hard on my stage unless I tell you to. 
MIKE Your stage? This stage belonged to a lot of great actor's, pal. But you are not one of them. 
Mike storms out of the room. Riggan follows him into... 
33   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          33 
...the hallway. He slaps Mike on his sun burned back. 
RIGGAN So, you wrote your own lines? 
He slaps him again. 
MIKE Ow. Fuck. Yes I did. 
RIGGAN You changed a few words, and mumbled a little, you self absorbed prick. 
MIKE Look who's talking... 
RIGGAN Let me tell you something, you spiteful nobody piece of shit. MIKE Nobody? My hard-on has already fifty thousand views on youtube. 
RIGGAN Fifty thousand views? A cat playing with a dildo has more than that. 
MIKE I don't care. 
RIGGAN Yes you do. (Beat.) Everybody says: "Mike is so honest". (Smacks him.) "So truthful". (Smacks him again.) 
MIKE (Like a child.) Ouch. Fuuuuuck. Cut the shit! Riggan corners Mike against the wall. 
RIGGAN You said in the interview that your father was a drunk, like Carver. Is that true Mike? Is it really true? 
Riggan stares intensely into Mike's eyes. Mike looks away. 
(CONTINUED) 
RIGGAN (CONT'D) Because my father was. My father was a mean fucking drunk. Beat the shit out of us. But we were okay with the beatings. You know why? Because at least when he was beating us, he wasn't thinking about taking us out to his tool shed... 
Mike's expression changes. 
RIGGAN (CONT'D) That sonofabitch would smile and say, "Do you want to kneel down and unbuckle my belt? Or do you want me to take it off and use it?" I learned how to make myself numb. But my sister-- (Holding back tears.) My little sister... 
Riggan can't go on. Mike is horrified. 
MIKE Jesus, Riggan. I'm really sorry. I didn't-- That's fucking horrible... 
RIGGAN (Crazy smile.) Yeah. It's also not true. See? (Cracking up.) I can pretend too, you little dick! 
Riggan shoves Mike violently. 
RIGGAN (CONT'D) Don't fuck with me, Mike. 
MIKE You're crazy... 
RIGGAN You have no idea what I'm capable of. You understand me? Riggan pulls the paper out of his back pocket. 
MIKE He was right, though. 
SAM About what? 
MIKE About your being special. You're hanging around here trying to make yourself (MORE) (CONTINUED) MIKE (CONT'D) invisible behind that fragile little fuck up routine. But you can't. You're anything but invisible. You're big. And you're sort of this really great mess, a candle burning at both ends, and no amount of booze or pills is gonna hide that. 
Sam tosses Mike's cigarette over the balcony, and kisses him. He leans into the kiss. MAN'S VOICE (From below.) Jesus Fuck! 
She suddenly pulls away. 
SAM It's a good thing you're an actor and not a writer cause that little speech was just like, Oprah... Hallmark... R. Kelly bad. She kisses him lightly one more time and then walks away. When she gets to the door she stops and leans on the frame. 
SAM (CONT'D) Truth or dare? 
MIKE Truth. 
SAM No. 
MIKE Truth. 
SAM No. Truth or dare? 
The slightest smile as she exits through the door, and after a short pause, Mike follows... 
39   INT. HALLWAYS - THEATRE - CONTINUOUS                         39 
...along a darkened hallway. They reach a tiny wooden door and Sam leads the way through it. 
MIKE Do you have any idea where you're going? 
SAM Absolutely not. 
(CONTINUED) 
She continues on until she gets to... 
40   INT. ABOVE STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                      40 
...the "grid" above stage where the lights are located. We can see, below us, the empty seats of the auditorium and the kitchen set. 
MIKE What now...? 
Mike reaches up to kiss her. She stops him. 
SAM How do you do it? MIKE What? 
SAM How do you go out there and pretend to be someone else in front of all those people? 
MIKE I don't pretend. Not out there. Just about every place else, but never out there. 
SAM Good to know. 
They stare at one another... 
MIKE What are we doing here? 
SAM What do you mean? 
MIKE I mean, what are we doing here? 
She moves in. 
SAM Adrenaline... They kiss. The camera begins to drift down toward the stage... 
RIGGAN (O.S.) Fucking teenager. 
As the camera continues down from the grid, we discover an auditorium full of people staring at the actors on stage. 
(CONTINUED) 
RIGGAN (O.S) (CONT'D) By the time I got to the hospital, the kid was dead. He was off in a corner laid out on a gurney. We took the old couple up to the O.R.. They were a mess. We worked like hell on them for most of the night... 
We pan along the auditorium back to the stage to find Riggan, Mike, Lesley and Laura in the kitchen. RIGGAN (CONT'D) When we were done, we wrapped them in full body casts. The husband was depressed. Even when I told him his wife was gonna pull through, he was still depressed. So, I got up to his mouth hole and asked him, and he told me it was because he couldn't see her through the eye holes. Can you imagine? I'm telling you, the man's heart was breaking because he couldn't turn his goddamn head and see his goddamn wife. 
LESLEY (In genuine tears.) That's terrible. (Beat.) Perfect. And terrible. 
Seeing no other way out, Riggan signs the autograph. 
TOURIST Dude! You fuckin' rock! 
Directly in front of him stand a lady and her two kids. 
LADY Can we take one picture? 
RIGGAN Are you kidding me? 
KID #1 Why is he naked? LADY One picture... 
KID #2 I can see his weenie. 
(CONTINUED) 
Riggan tries to get past them, but a crowd has formed. A swarm of cell phones begin to glow like fireflies. 
LADY (To her kids.) Get next to him! 
RIGGAN Give me a fucking break, lady. 
The kids run up next to him. Even more people crowding around. Riggan puts up his middle finger, just as the Lady takes the shot. He shoves the kids aside and moves on. 
WOMAN ON STREET He looks so old in person. 
MAN ON STREET (From across the street.) You suck! RIGGAN Fuck you! 
Riggan pushes through the crowd to get to the lobby. The people begin to chant. Dozens of cell phones recording him. 
CROWD Bird-man! Bird-man! Bird-man! 
Riggan pushes his way through to the lobby doors... 
43   INT. LOBBY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                             43 
...to be stopped by the vision of Ralph in a wheelchair. His head wrapped in a bandage. A man in a suit next to him. 
RIGGAN Jesus Christ! What're you doing here? 
RALPH Waiting for Jake. This is Mr. Roth, my attorney. 
Riggan continues walking toward the auditorium. Ralph and Mr. Roth follow him. 
MR. ROTH We're pursuing financial remuneration for the injuries Mr. Pinkus suffered while rehearsing your-- 
RIGGAN I have a play to do. (CONTINUED) 
RALPH I'm going to ruin you! 
Riggan storms toward the auditorium, but is stopped by an old Usher. 
OLD USHER I'm sorry sir, you're going to have-- 
Riggan shoves the old lady aside and enters... 
44   INT. AUDITORIUM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                       44 
...the theater. Riggan stands in the back among the audience. He sees the "rain" falling on the stage. The "Motel" sign is lit. Mike and Lesley are in bed, for the motel scene, waiting for the knock on the door. With nothing else to do, Riggan yells his line from the back of the auditorium... 
RIGGAN Knock knock knock! Terri! Terri! 
The audience turns to see Riggan standing in his underwear. They begin to murmur and laugh and point at him. Riggan marches down the aisle. He looks haggard and covered with perspiration. 
Lesley and Mike, confused, come out of bed. 
LESLEY Ed! What are you doing here? 
RIGGAN Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for you-- I worshipped you... 
MIKE Listen Ed, I know this is hard but-- 
RIGGAN Fuck you. Shut up. Fuck you. 
Giggles from the audience. Riggan turns threateningly and points to an audience member on the aisle who is giggling at him. 
Riggan sits up slowly. He is really hung over. BIRDMAN (V.O.) Stand up! Forget about the times. Everyone else has. So you're not a great actor... Who cares?!! You're much more than that. Fuck! You tower over all these theater douchebags. You're a movie star! A Global force! Don't you get it? 
Riggan stands up and begins to stumble forward. We pan around to find Birdman (a stronger Riggan wearing a cool Birdman outfit), following behind him. 
BIRDMAN You spent your whole life building a reputation and a bank account, and now they're both blown. So what? Fuck it. We make a come back. Something huge. Take what belongs to us. Take back the spotlight. Magazine covers and billboards. Happy meals with Birdman dolls. Remember that? That's who you are. That's who we are! 
Riggan just marches on. People and cars pass by, but nobody notices Birdman. Riggan tries to ignore him. 
BIRDMAN (CONT'D) C'mon, buddy. Tell me we're going back to the big leagues. Let's do this. Shave off that pathetic goatee, and put the mask back on! Batman my balls. We'll start a new franchise. Birdman: Phoenix Rising. Trust me! A billion world wide. Swear to God. 
A50                                                                 A50 
Riggan keeps walking. Birdman, insistent, chases, until suddenly he begins to flutter off the ground. 
BIRDMAN Do you hear me? You can do anything! You're an icon! (CONTINUED) 
Desperate, Birdman flies a bit higher around him. 
BIRDMAN (CONT'D) You're bigger than life. You save people from their boring, miserable lives... 
The camera pans to the street in front of them. People carry out their everyday routines. There is a deli, a souvenir shop, a small bank... 
BIRDMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) ...You make them jump, laugh, cry, shit their pants... All you have to do is snap your fingers and... 
B50                                                                 B50 Riggan snaps his fingers, once, twice, and the bank suddenly explodes. The sound is so loud that it seems to belong to another movie. The earth shakes. People run. Dust all over. Fire. An unsteady camera pans back to Birdman. 
BIRDMAN (Excited.) That's what I'm talking about! That is cool! Explosive! Big, fast, loud! (He turns directly to the camera and talks about the audience.) Look at them. They love that shit! They starve for blood and action, not this artsy-fartsy-philosophical bullshit! 
C50                                                                 C50 We hear a loud roar, and the camera pans to discover a huge alien about to crash a cab against the asphalt. Birdman uses his powerful blow to send the alien flying away. 
BIRDMAN And when you shout "whooaa!"... (Riggan shouts "Whooaa!") ...it explodes in the eardrum of millions. Your power is unlimited. 
Riggan slows down his pace, as he starts to listen. 
BIRDMAN (CONT'D) You glimmered on 3000 screens, over 5 continents, in 47 countries at the same time. You are ubiquitous. You're a God! You can do it again. You can soar above all of them. 
D50                                                               D50 
Riggan suddenly begins to levitate. 
BIRDMAN There you go, you mother fucker! See? Gravity doesn't even apply to you. 
The camera flies up with Riggan as he floats above the street. There is something magical in his ascension, gently impelled by the breeze. A beautiful backlight makes his body glow. Birdman flutters around him. BIRDMAN (CONT'D) Listen to me. We gotta go back! We have to do this. We have to end it on our terms. With a grand gesture. 
A strange light suddenly palpitates in Riggan's eyes. Something makes sense in what Birdman is telling him. 
The camera becomes Riggan's POV. He looks down to see the people on the street, watching him in awe. BIRDMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) We'll go back. We'll show them how much they're going to miss us. Flames. Icarus. Sacrifice... 
We tilt up again to Riggan's face. He has a plan. 
BIRDMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) Let's go back one more time and show them what we're capable of. You can do it. You're Birdman. Do you hear me? You're... 
A GUY'S VOICE (O.S.) Birdman! 
E50                                                               E50 
And as the camera pulls away, we discover Birdman is gone and Riggan is standing on the ledge of a tall building. The camera tilts down and we see that more people have gathered around, and more cars has stopped, and they all point at Riggan, worried about the situation. 
A guy wearing shorts, a Bob Marley t-shirt and a robe opens his window, one floor below Riggan, and looks up at him. 
GUY Dude, what are you doing? 
Riggan looks down at the people on the street far below. (CONTINUED) 
GUY (CONT'D) You okay, buddy? Do you want me to call someone? 
We pan to a lady on her balcony filming Riggan with her phone. 
LADY Is this for real, or you're shooting a film? 
RIGGAN A film. 
The lady looks around but sees nothing. 
LADY Oh, you people are full of shit. 
SYLVIA (CONT'D) Are you okay? You seem-- I don't know, you seem abnormally calm. 
RIGGAN I am calm. I'm great. I spent most of the day observing how beautifully this pile of dirty clothes was lit by the warm afternoon sun. (A tiny smile.) So beautiful. Sylvia, teasing him, closes her eyes and imitates Riggan's meditation posture. 
SYLVIA (Mocking him.) Oh yes. God is those purplish light dots I see between my eyes and my eyelids. 
RIGGAN You know? I have this voice that talks to me and tells me the truth. It's comforting, and scary. 
A beat. 
SYLVIA I'm going to pretend I didn't hear you say that. 
RIGGAN Okay. 
SYLVIA (Changing the subject.) You wouldn't believe the crowd outside. They said, some people paid up to 500 dollars a ticket. 
He sits down. RIGGAN You wanna hear something funny? 
SYLVIA Sure. 
RIGGAN Do you remember our last anniversary party? 
SYLVIA Seriously? You're going to ruin a nice moment with that? 
(CONTINUED) 
RIGGAN Do you remember the party? 
SYLVIA The party where you fucked Janet Rossbach in our bed? Yeah, it rings a bell. 
RIGGAN Yeah, well. Let's skip over that part for a minute. SYLVIA Gladly. 
RIGGAN After you threw the guests out of the house, and the furniture out of the window. You locked yourself in the bathroom. 
SYLVIA I remember. Why are we-- 
RIGGAN I drove down to Malibu. I sat on the beach for a while. Just... staring out at the ocean. 
SYLVIA Riggan... 
RIGGAN Until I walked straight into the water and tried to drown myself. 
Silence. Sylvia stares at Riggan, surprised. 
RIGGAN (CONT'D) I was in up to my chest when I felt the first one. On my back, like somebody was holding a frying pan against me. And then my chest, and my legs. The water was full of jellyfish. I fought my way out of the water, and I started rolling around the sand like a maniac... crying. 
Sylvia doesn't know how to react. 
SYLVIA You said it was a sunburn. 
RIGGAN (Smiling.) And you believed me. 
(CONTINUED) 
SYLVIA To be honest, I didn't give a shit. 
RIGGAN I love you. And I love Sam. 
SYLVIA I know. 
Silence. They stare at each other. RIGGAN I never should have video taped Sam's birth. First of all because you and Sam both look like shit in that video. But mostly because I missed the moment. I should have just been there with the two of you. Present in my own life. So I'd have it. But, I don't. I don't have any of it. SYLVIA You have Sam. 
RIGGAN No, I don't. 
SYLVIA Listen, she's just-- 
RIGGAN No, I understand. She needed a father and she got one shamefully successful youtube video. Pretty pathetic. 
SYLVIA (Putting a finger on Riggan's lips.) Shhh... There are more pathetic things than that. That mustache, for example. She kisses him. 
ANNIE ON SPEAKERS Places for act two. Places. 
SYLVIA Riggan... 
RIGGAN You should get back to your seat. You don't want to miss what's next. 
The audience, one by one, jump to their feet, applauding wildly. The sole exception is Tabitha, who remains seated, a dazed expression on her face. We stay with the audience a few seconds longer. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
The sounds slowly vanish. After a moment of silence... BIRDMAN (V.O.) You won't be hearing from him anymore. 
MAN (V.O.) Is he...? 
BIRDMAN (V.O) He's gone. 
INT. WAITING ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAWN 
One of the old Birdman films is playing on a small television screen that hangs on a corner. The scene ends and a Morning Show host appears. Behind him a picture of Riggan and a caption that reads: "Nation in shock." A shot of a candle vigil in Central park. 
HOST What do we talk about when we talk about Riggan Thomson? When we come back, more on the actor who two nights ago shot himself during the opening performance of his new Broadway play... 
We pan away from the TV to see that the waiting room is filled with newsmen waiting for something to happen. There is almost no room to breath. 
We pan to see Jake emerging from an elevator, carrying a newspaper under his arm. He walks through the dense mass of newsmen with a serious expression on his face. We follow him into... 
INT. ROOM - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS 
...a room. Jake peers in. Riggan lies on a bed, the bandages on his nose cover most of his face. Sylvia is looking out the window. 
JAKE Is he...? 
SYLVIA He's awake. 
Jake enters the room. 
JAKE (Serious.) I thought I lost you, buddy. Thank god you're a horrible shot! What the hell happened? I was watching you up on that stage, and all of a sudden you get that goofy look in your eye, and you were just like-- 
He starts to laugh. 
SYLVIA What the hell are you laughing about? He tried to-- What is wrong with you? (CONTINUED) 
JAKE I'm happy, okay? He's alive. My best friend is alive. And he is the man of the hour! 
Jake holds the New York Times up in the air. 
RIGGAN What is that? 
JAKE You did it. 
SYLVIA (Coming to them.) You have to be shitting me... She wrote a review? 
Jake unfolds the newspaper and we see the headline of the review: "The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance". JAKE (To Sylvia.) Read it. 
He hands her the newspaper. She begins to read to herself. 
SYLVIA I don't believe this... 
JAKE Read it out loud! 
SAM "Thompson has unwittingly given birth to a new form that can only be described as supra-realism. Blood was spilled both literally and metaphorically by artist and audience alike. Red blood. The blood that has been sorely missing from the veins of the American theatre..." (Beat. To a smiling Jake.) You're happy about this? 
She hands it to Riggan. 
JAKE Happy? I'm fucking euphoric. This is the-- This is the kind of review that turns someone into a living legend. 
(CONTINUED) 
SYLVIA He tried to-- He shot the nose off his face! 
JAKE He's got a new nose! And if he doesn't like that one, we'll get him another one. We can use Meg Ryan's guy. Who gives a shit? Turn on the tv. There are people praying for him all over the country. They're lighting candles in Central Park. He did it. (To Riggan) You did it! The play's gonna run forever. It's gonna open in London, in Paris... The studios will call us again. We'll get book offers. 
SYLVIA How do you know all that? You can see the future? JAKE (Euphoric.) Yes. 
She slaps him in the face. 
SYLVIA Did you see that coming? You're so full of shit, Jake. 
Jake needs a few seconds to recover. Then he looks at Riggan who just sits there, in silence. 
JAKE Why aren't you saying anything? This is what you wanted wasn't it? (Riggan gazes at the review.) Riggan, this is what you wanted. RIGGAN It's what I wanted.

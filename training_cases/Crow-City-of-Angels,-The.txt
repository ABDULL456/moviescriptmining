THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS 
Written by 
David S Goyer & James O'Barr 
FADE IN: 
EXT. LIMBO - DAY/NIGHT 
A heavy mist hangs before us - endless and impenetrable. And out of that primordial fog a CROW materializes, flying toward the camera in slow motion. 
SARAH (O.S.) 
I believe there's a place where the restless souls wander. Burdened by the weight of their own sadness, they cannot enter Heaven... 
Presently a second shape materializes - a FIGURE ON HORSEBACK. A warrior whose baleful eyes shine behind the familiar irony mask war paint. 
SARAH (O.S.) 
And so they wait, trapped between our world and the next, endlessly searching for a way to rid themselves of their pain - in the hopes that somehow, some day... 
The figure on horseback sweeps past us, disappearing once again into the mists of time. 
SARAH (V.O.) 
... they will be reunited with the ones they love. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DOCS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT 
Present day. The Crow settles on a shipping container, tilts its head, watching... 
SUPER TITLE: 
"CITY OF ANGELS - OCTOBER 29TH - LA NOCHE DE SAN LUCAS" 
CLOSE ON A PAIR OF HANDS tearing open a tiny glassine envelope filled with powder - our drug du jour - Trinity. The face of the envelope has been stamped with an image - a cartoon imp with a shit-eating gring giving us the thumbs-up sign. 
A MAN lowers his face to the envelope, snorts up the powder. The man discards the glassine envelope... 
FOLLOWING THE ENVELOPE 
as it flutters to the ground, landing "imp-side" up. Let the rush begin. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
Garbage-poisoned waters wreathed in fog. Although once part of a thriving shipping industry, decades of decline have seen these docks become a hellish dumping ground. Case in point: 
A FATHER AND HIS YOUNG SON 
are kneeling next to one another at the end of a pier, their arms linked together, then tied behind their backs. DANNY CORVEN (8) is quietly sobbing. ASHE (late 20s), tries to calm the frightened boy. 
DANNY 
I'm sorry, Dad...I'm sorry... I didn't mean to look... 
ASHE 
It's okay, Danny. It's okay... 
NEMO (O.S.) 
Lights... 
A bright light comes on. Ashe and Danny turn their heads to avoid the glare. 
NEMO (O.S.) 
...camera... 
CLOSE ON 
A camcorder lens as it auto-focuses, bringing Danny's distorted face into view via the lens' reflection. 
NEMO (O.S.) 
...action. 
CAMERA FINDS Ashe and Danny's executioners, CURVE, KALI, SPIDER MONKEY, and NEMO. 
NEMO, a post-modern sleaze-hound, circles Danny and Ashe with a camcorder. He Pats Ashe's face. 
NEMO 
Make-up. 
SPIDER MONKEY, lean and gangly, crouches next to Ashe, holding a marigold in his hand. 
SPIDER MONKEY 
rides the thermals above an urban sprawl riven by fires, floods, and earthquakes. Smog hangs in the air like an army of ever-present ghosts. We pass over a roof where someone has painted a smart-ass welcome mat for the benefit of anyone flying overhead - "GO BACK". Nevertheless, we continue on. 
SARAH (V.O.) 
They say that time cancels pain. I don't know about that. Eight years ago I lost two of my best friends. Two thousand miles later I find I'm still living in the past... 
THE CROW 
sweeps down into man-made caverns of pigeon-shit concrete and grimy glass. Through the bird's eyes we glimpse the city's silent HOMELESS. Automobile hulks littering the streets like insect husks. The shifting searchlights of police helicopters... 
WE PASS OVER SARAH'S ROOFTOP 
The Crow circles downward... 
SARAH (V.O.) 
Every night when I close my eyes the dreams come. That's how the dead talk to us, I guess. In the dark, when our souls are off wandering... 
INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT 
The Crow lands next to an open window. It perches on the edge, looking into the loft. 
SARAH (V.O.) 
I just wish I understood what they were telling me. 
CROW'S POV (ANAMORPHIC) 
SARAH, early 20s, lies asleep in bed. She stirs, troubled by uneasy dreams, rolls over, opens her eyes... 
INT. SARAH'S LOFT, SLEEPING AREA - NIGHT 
As Sarah rises the Crow flits away like yesterday's memory. Sarah's not sure whether or not she dreamed the bird. GABRIEL, the cat Sarah inherited from Eric and Shelly, is perched on the end of the bed. 
SARAH 
Hey, Gabriel... 
Sarah gives the cat an obligatory behind-the-ear scratch, then climbs from bed, making her way across the loft. 
SARAH'S ARTIST LOFT 
is furnished in thrift-store treasures. The loft has an earthy warmth to it, in stark contrast to the urban decay outside - an island amidst a sea of unrest, dominated by an arching half-circle window through which Sarah can view the local wildlife on the streets below. 
ON SARAH'S CANVASSES 
Turbulent oils reminiscent of history's brooding symbolist painters. Give Sarah's childhood inspiration, the subject matter is no real surprise. 
CAMERA ISOLATES a work-in-progress. The painting depicts a woman resembling Sarah being cradled in the arms of her pale-faced lover, surrounded by a sea of watchful dead. 
SARAH 
reaches the shower, strips off her clothes. Her back and upper arms are decorated with graceful tattoo work - a pair of black angel wings sweeping over her shoulder blades. She's got a ring in her navel, another in a nipple... 
In short, the skate-waif we knew back in Detroit has matured quite a bit since that fateful Devil's Night. Sarah shuts here eyes, turns her face up into the spray. For a brief second we see a flash of... 
EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT 
Ashe's death. Plunging into the icy waters, down into darkness. Just as suddenly we are back in... 
INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT 
Sarah's eyes snap open. She holds a hand out to the shower wall, takes a moment to collect herself. 
Troubled, Sarah climbs from the shower, shrugs on some clothes. Among her accourterments is a necklace featuring a silver ankh, the symbol of eternity. 
As Sarah sites in front of her vanity we catch sight of the irony mask that used to hang by Shelly's mirror. Next to the mask is a... 
TARNISHED WEDDING RING 
Once Shelly's. There's an inscription inside - "FOREVER". 
Sarah fingers the ring a moment, glancing at the irony mask. Lots of memories. Lots of ghosts. 
Gabriel creeps up, MEOWING forlornly. 
SARAH 
(WISTFULLY) 
Me too. 
She threads the ring onto her necklace, letting it fall next to the ankh, then slips the silver chain over her head. Sarah stands, pulls on a jacket, heads out. 
EXT. SARAH'S LOFT, STREET - DUSK 
An ill-wind kicks up trash and grit. Sarah glances down. Dozens of the glassine imp envelopes swirl around Sarah's feet like confetti. One of the envelopes has stuck to her heel. As she peels it off, she catches sight of... 
A PALE FACE 
in a shadowed entryway. It's a TEENAGED GIRL (16), strung out on drugs. The girl cowers in a narrow stairway, hugging herself, shivering from withdrawal. 
SARAH 
Beats pushing ink in Detroit. 
NOAH 
That it does, Princess, that it does. 
(REMEMBERING) 
Oh, I bought you a little present... 
Noah reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls something out. It's a handmade candy sugar skull with a little strip of paper glued to the bottom - a fortune. 
NOAH 
They do 'em for the Day of the Dead. 
(tossing the skull to Sarah) 
Nice, huh? Necrophagia, Princess. Eat the dead. 
SARAH 
(reading fortune) 
"Life is just a dream on the way to death." I like that. 
Sarah studies the skull, then pops it in her mouth, nodding. Noah rises, stretching. 
NOAH 
Want to grab a beer, then? 
SARAH 
No, I gotta go home. Haven't been sleeping much lately. 
NOAH 
So, what's the dirty dog's name? 
SARAH 
I've just been having some weird dreams. 
(REFLECTING) 
You ever dream that you're dying someone else's death? 
Outside we hear a MOTORCYCLE pulling up, then someone KNOCKS on the front door. 
NOAH 
(calling out) 
Sorry, we're closed. 
CURVE 
appears outside. He POUNDS harder on the door. 
CURVE 
Open the fucking door! 
NOAH 
stands, moves to the door. 
NOAH 
Look, I said we're... 
BANG! Curve kicks open the door and storms in. He PUNCHES Noah in the nose, then heads straight for Sarah. 
CURVE 
You think what you did to me is funny? Some kind of joke? 
SARAH 
What are you talking about?! 
CURVE 
I'm talking about the fucking tattoo you gave me! I took off the bandages. Look...!!! 
Curve rips open his shirt, revealing his chest. 
CURVE'S TATTOO 
EXT. GRAY GARGOYLE, ALLEYWAY - NIGHT 
Sarah rushes out of her car, screaming at the bird. 
SARAH 
Get out of here! Go!!! 
Sarah FIRES a wild shot into the sky. The Crow files off into the night. Sarah collapses against the hood of her Galaxy and starts to cry. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT 
The Crow soars away from the Gargoyle, toward the beckoning lights of Downtown. In the distance, a flashing "JESUS SAVES" sign draws our attention to a monolithic tower. 
EXT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT 
The Crow makes its way towards the decaying tower, which is crowned by a weather-worn campanile. The campanile is a complex arabesque of rusted iron scrollwork, like something Antonio Gaudi conjured up from an art nouveau fever-dream. 
Just as the Crow is about to reach the campanile, it banks away. We, however, continue to rush onward, right through one of the dark openings in the scrollwork... 
INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT 
SCRITCH! SCRITCH! All we see is black, then some vague, shiny reflections... 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a stag beetle, imprisoned within a box, leashed to a nail with a piece of thread. We were tight on its shiny carapace. The beetle strains at its leash, moving in a perpetual circle around the nail. 
CAMERA MOVES UP 
over the side of the box. Although mere inches in height, this enclosure might as well be the Great Wall as far as our little member of the Coleoptera is concerned. 
AS THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK 
we see crime lord Judah Earl's lair in all its sepulchral glory... 
Dark, filled with shadows. The decor is a cross between ruinous palatial splendor and a SoHo industrial art installation. The upper reaches of the campanile are laced with a spiderweb network of steel girders. 
Look close enough and you might see PEOPLE bound to the supporting pillars, like the half-glimpsed shapes crouching at the foot of your bed in the middle of the night. 
VOICES draw our attention to an area partitioned off by chain-mail curtains. CAMERA MOVES IN towards a break in the curtains. We linger there for a tantalizing moment... 
JUDAH (V.O.) 
Talk to me, Sibyl. Tell me what you see. 
SIBYL (V.O.) 
I see Death returning from the veil of tears. He has your name on his tongue. 
Now we plunge in through the curtains... 
The "camera" consists of a series of lenses and mirrors which project images from the outside world onto a circular table, offering the ultimate voyeuristic view of the crumbling cityscape. TWO FIGURES stand with their backs to us, studying the camera's view. The first is... 
JUDAH EARL, 
A sinewy, slash-mouthed Byronic figure with a guttural voice. Old before his time, touched by childhood visions of his own death. The tower is Judah's prison in more ways than one. 
SIBYL, Judah's blind oracle, waits by his side. Attractive, though of indeterminate sex. His/her dour features are hidden beneath a black cowl. 
JUDAH 
(FATALISTIC) 
It's finally beginning, isn't it? What mask will Death wear, can you tell me that? 
SIBYL 
I see the face of one of your victims. 
Judah lifts his head up and we see his luminous amber eyes for the first time. A kind of madness dances within them. 
JUDAH 
All my sins remembered. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT 
Sarah sits in bed, cigarette burning in one hand, a half-filled wine glass in the other. She turns out her light, looks to the window and the cityscape beyond - as if the answers were lying out there in the steam-cloaked streets. 
CUT TO: 
SOMEONE'S SPEED-INDUCED POV. Performers flaunt their flesh on a raised stage. CROWDS OF SEXUAL LIBERTINES and CUTTING EDGE FETISHISTS writhe as one on the dance floor. Lots of rubber, latex strap bodices, Victorian hoop skirts - it's a modern-day De Sade's wet-dream. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
on Curve as he pushes his way upstairs and through the tangle of flesh. 
He pulls up to a bar, takes a seat alongside Kali and Spider Monkey (who's amusing himself with a Viewmaster). CLICK, CLICK - we see 
ASHE 
(READING) 
"...midway through our life's journey I came to myself within a dark wood where the straight way was lost..." 
Danny asleep, curled up next to his father. Ashe reaches out and strokes Danny's hair... 
CLOSE ON ASHE'S FACE 
His dead eyes suddenly open. Confusion. Pain. Fear. A stream of bubbles rushes from his mouth, obscuring our view. 
ASHE'S POV 
As the bubbles clear, Danny's face comes into focus just a few inches from his own. 
Ashe panics, jerks back. The razor-wire barbs cut into his flesh. The more he struggles, the tighter the coils become, slashing his hands and face, shredding his clothes. He's caught in his son's embrace, the two of them thrashing about in a grotesque underwater ballet. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RIVER STYX BRIDGE - NIGHT 
The headlights of Sarah's Galaxy cut through the fog. She pulls up just in time to see the Crow disappearing into the mist which cloaks the bridge. Sarah follows, trying to keep up with the bird. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. UNDER WATER - NIGHT 
Ashe's struggles become more and more violent. He thrashes, churning up a cloud of bubbles. We are intercutting quickly now, between Ashe's turmoil and... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT 
Sarah reaches the pier where Ashe and Danny were executed. She climbs from her car... 
THE CROW 
flies on ahead, landing atop one of the piles, staring down into the water. 
AND AS SARAH 
starts toward the bird we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. UNDER WATER - NIGHT 
Ashe tears his hands free, clawing his body away from the barbwire, swimming to the surface in a storm of bubbles... 
FLASHBACKS 
of subjective POVs. The killers walking down the jetty, marching Ashe and Danny to their deaths and... 
EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL DISTRICT - NIGHT 
We are beneath the jetty now in the present, looking up through the slats as a FIGURE (Sarah?) makes its way to the water... 
Camera CRANES UP from beneath the jetty to reveal Sarah standing there in silhouette... 
EXT. UNDER WATER - NIGHT 
Ashe is propelled towards the surface. 
EXT. DOCKS COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT 
Ashe suddenly bursts from the sea with his arms outstretched. A hellish Venus on the half-shell. Gasping, full of terror and rage. He lets loose a TORTURED HOWL. 
ASHE 
digs his fingers into the wood-rot pulp of the pilings and claws his way up to the jetty. He collapses down onto the wooded slats. 
ASHE 
crouches before us, his face hidden from view. He reaches out his hand, touching an unmistakable BLOOD STAIN... Danny's blood stain. This triggers more painful memories... 
EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT 
Images from Ashe and Danny's execution assault him. BANG!!! Kali FIRING her gun. Ashe SCREAMING. Danny's body slumping forward like a marionette whose strings have been severed. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT (PRESENT) 
Ashe lifts his head, WAILING. He's covered from head to toe in ocean-bottom silt. Blood from the razor-wire wounds has smeared across his face in patterns which eerily recall the Crow make-up. Strips of the wire still cling to his arms and chest, the barbs buried deep in his flesh. 
Reliving the violent moment is more than his mind can bear. Ashe's eyes roll up into his head. The world spins around him. But even as the lights are going out, Ashe glimpses... 
A DARK FIGURE 
standing in front of him. It's the last thing Ashe sees before consciousness escapes him. 
Ashe gasps. He stares down at the incongruous sight of a knife-handle stickout out from his sternum, then he yanks the knife back out. No pain. No wound. A moment of shock, then... 
ASHE 
(looking at her, a tortured whisper) 
I'm dreaming this. 
Sarah tries to reach for Ashe again. He tears away from her, flinging her back and running for the door. 
EXT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT 
Ashe stumbles from the doorway out onto the sidewalk. He rushes blindly up the street. 
CAMERA WHIP-PANS 
from the fleeing Ashe to Sarah's window. On a pillar outside, the Crow is waiting... 
INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT 
Sarah rushes to the window, watching Ashe run. She SEES the Crow perched below her. It takes wings, flying after Ashe... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BRIDGE/GARAGE - NIGHT 
Beneath the arching span of a freeway bridge is a series of corrugated iron sheds. CAMERA FOLLOWS as Ashe, exhausted fro his run, makes his way towards them. The Crow flies on ahead, landing next to one of the doors, beckoning... 
Ashe slides one of the RATTLING doors open... 
INT. GARAGE - NIGHT 
As light spills in, we catch a glimpse of the humble auto repair garage - tools, a few wrecks-in-progress, a motorcycle... 
CAMERA ISOLATES a tempera painting on the floor that's been executed on construction paper. A brush and a collection of paint canisters are scattered around it, like the kind you might find in a primary school art class. Ashe kneels next to the painting... 
CLOSE ON PAINTING 
An image rendered by a child's optimistic imagination - a crude father and sone, respectively labeled "DAD" and "ME". A FOOTPRINT mars the otherwise perfect memento. Ashe touches the figure labeled "ME", which triggers... 
INT. GARAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
Ashe is working beneath a car. Danny is sprawled on the floor. He holds up the painting in question. 
DANNY 
Hey, Dad...what color should I make the sun? 
ASHE 
Blue. 
DANNY 
There's no such thing. 
ASHE 
(PLAYFUL) 
No. Well there should be. 
Just then we hear a GUNSHOT coming from outside. 
DANNY 
(wide eyed) 
What was that? 
Danny climbs to his feet, moves outside... 
ASHE 
Danny, wait! 
Ashe slides out from under the car. 
EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
From the back doorway, Ashe and Danny catch sight of Curve and his crew executing someone beneath the freeway overpass. Curve's face is splattered with blood. He turns and sees them... 
CURVE 
See no evil. 
EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
Now we're back at the pier. The memory flashes are coming faster and faster. Danny is sobbing once again. 
DANNY'S VOICE 
Ashe rockets beneath the gothic arches of the freeway overpass on his motorcycle, hellfire burning in his eyes, his coat flapping behind him like a fallen angel's wings. 
THE CROW 
flies alongside Ashe. 
THE CROW 
lands on a telephone wire, studying the warehouse. 
Presently we hear Ashe's MOTORCYCLE approaching, then we see the front wheel of his bike pulling into the foreground. 
CROW'S POV (ANAMORPHIC) 
Ashe turns to the Crow, slyly giving the bird the thumbs-up sign... 
MATCH CUT TO... 
INT. SPIDER MONKEY'S WAREHOUSE LAB - NIGHT 
CA-CHUNK, CA-CHUNK, CA-CHUNK. CLOSE ON a sheet of glassine drug bags as a hand-powered printing press comes down, mass-producing the image of the imp giving us the thumbs up... 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL the lab set up in a maze of barrells. The walls are stained from the toxic fumes. Blacked-out windows sweat with moisture. There are heating mantles rigged with flasks and condensers, vacuum pumps - along with ingredients like battery acid, paint thinner, and Epsom salts. Nearby are dozens of 50-gallon drums containing the finished product. 
Spider Monkey is working away at the printing press, pausing to snoot some of Judah's drug. Nearby is an old TV featuring lurid videos of amateur bull riding - we watch as a drunken participant gets gored. 
Suddenly the power in the lab goes out, the TV screen sputters and goes dark. 
SPIDER MONKEY 
Ono! 
ASHE (O.S.) 
'My mother was accursed the night she bore me and I am faint with envy of all the dead'. 
Spider Monkey whirls around, startled. Ashe is sitting cross-legged on one of the tables, grinning like a black leather Buddha. 
ASHE 
Tell me, Monkey. Does the corpse have a familiar face? 
SPIDER MONKEY 
Who the fuck are you? 
ASHE 
You have to learn to look beyond the mask. 
Ashe jumps down from the table, walking into the light. Spider Monkey's eyes widen in recognition. 
SPIDER MONKEY 
No way, man...we put you under...you and that little snot-nosed kid... 
Ashe dips his hand into one of the 50-gallon drums. He blows a handful of the Trinity dust at Spider Monkey. Spider Monkey, terminally spooked, reaches back to the counter behind him, searching for something... 
ASHE 
Looking for this? 
Ashe holds up a pistol and puts it to his head. 
ASHE 
(an evil grin) 
Don't try this at home, kids. 
BOOM! ASHE 
puts a bullet through his own forehead. His head snaps backward and his body collapses onto the floor. Spider Monkey creeps forward toward Ashe's body... 
ASHE 
springs from the ground, SLAMMING Spider Monkey against a table of chemicals. Bottles SHATTER on the floor, spilling their toxic contents. 
SPIDER MONKEY 
What are you?! What the fuck are you?! 
Ashe leans in so he's eye to eye with Spider Monkey. 
ASHE 
I wasn't sure at first. Now I know. I'm the boiling man, Monkey. I'm the plague of Darkness and the death of the first-born. All your nightmares rolled into one. 
Ashe removes a wooden match from his inside coat pocket. He scrapes his thumb-nail over the head, igniting it. 
SPIDER MONKEY 
NEMO 
Shitfire... 
Nemo fumbles with his pants, scoops out some more tokens... 
Too late, the shutter is already closing. Nemo feeds some more tokens into the slot. Nothing happens. Nemo punches the LED display. 
NEMO 
Come on, fucker! 
The shutter starts rattling up again, only this time... 
ASHE 
is standing on the other side of the Plexiglas. His mouth splits into an evil grin. 
ASHE 
"Do you want me, baby?" 
Nemo's eyes just about pop from his skull. 
NEMO 
You. 
ASHE 
Me. 
CRASH! Ashe slams his fists through the Plexiglas window, reaching for Nemo's throat. 
INT. PEEP-O-RAMA, HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Nemo comes flying out the booth door. He struggles to rise. A CHORUS OF ORGASMIC SIGHS and cheesy SURF MUSIC drifts out from the other booths. 
ZEKE 
(o.s.) 
Hey, mime boy. 
AT THE FRONT COUNTER. 
ZEKE, the Peep-O-Rama's corpulent manager, is cradling a sawed-off shotgun. BOOM! He blows a blast into Ashe's chest! 
Ashe starts toward Zeke, unfazed. Zeke moves to fire again... 
Ashe snatches the shotgun from the fat man's grasp, smashing him in the face with the butt-end. Zeke falls back into a video display, sending an avalanche of porno tapes raining down on top of him. 
Seizing the moment, Nemo rushes for the exit... 
Ashe spins, pumps the shotgun, blows out one of Nemo's kneecaps. Nemo collapses on the floor, wailing like a child. Ashe strides over to him. 
ASHE 
One crow sorrow... 
He HEAVES Nemo through a glass display booth filled with sex toys. Ashe punctuates each line of the nursery rhyme with a new assault on Nemo. 
ASHE 
...two crows joy... 
Nemo starts dragging his broken body across the floor. He finds himself face to face with an anatomically-correct blow-up sex doll - the kind with a built-in pre-recorded memory chip. 
DOLL 
Ooh, oh baby, I like it like that. You're so good. You're so good... 
ASHE 
Three crows a letter, four crows a boy... 
Ashe HEAVES Nemo back the other way, sending him SMASHING into the front counter. Peep-O-Rama tokens go flying, bouncing and spinning every which way... 
CLOSE ON A SPINNING TOKEN 
On one side of the coin the eye is open, on the other it's closed - this creates the illusion of the eye blinking. 
ASHE 
Five crows silver, six crows gold... 
Nemo utters a half-sob and rolls over, feebly wiping away the blood which is clouding his eyes. 
ASHE 
Seven crows a secret never to be told. 
Do you know what they call a gathering of crows, Curve? 
At the sound of Ashe's voice, Curve's eyes widen with fear. 
ASHE'S VOICE 
A murder. A murder of crows. Think about it. 
CLICK! The line goes dead. Furious, Curve tears the phone from the wall, HEAVING it across the porno shop. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET/CHURCH - NIGHT 
Ashe exits a phone booth, leaving the receiver dangling. A DOG BARKS nearby, followed by the sound of CHILDREN LAUGHING. Ashe turns and sees... 
A GROUP OF CHILDREN running away, giggling, their FOOTSTEPS receding into the night. 
A BLACK DOG trots toward Ashe. The children have tied a plastic skull mask to the dog's head. The skull dog trots up the street towards... 
A SMALL, INNER-CITY LATINO CHURCH 
sandwiched between two derelict buildings. The doors are open - there's a path of marigold petals leading up the front steps. The skull dog trots up the steps and enters. 
INT. CHURCH - NIGHT 
Ashe moves into the sanctuary. He watches from the rear, entranced. PEOPLE are scattered amongst the pews. 
At the altar is a lavish offrenda - an offering of food and drink for the wandering dead decorated with sugar skulls and floral garlands. Amidst the decorations are photos of departed loved ones. There are tiers of candles surrounding these, scores of them. 
An ELDERLY PRIEST emerges from a confessional, looking to Ashe with a raised eyebrow..."Next?". 
PRIEST 
Can I help you? 
ASHE 
I'm sorry, Father, I was just watching... 
PRIEST 
Our doors are open. 
The Priest moves to a candelabra and lights some tapers. 
ASHE 
What is this for? 
PRIEST 
Dias de los Muertos, the Days of the Dead. We light the candles for our loved ones - so that they might find their way back to earth and share in the pleasures of the living. 
Ashe watches an OLD WOMAN place a toy motorcycle in front of a picture of a child. 
PRIEST 
Tomorrow night we will celebrate. The people will dance, sing... 
(indicating Ashe's makeup) 
...many will wear masks. 
ASHE 
Why? 
PRIEST 
Some spirits linger here too long. They become confused, mistaking themselves for the living. They have to be frightened away. 
The priest nods to Ashe and moves down the aisle to the next candelabra. 
A LITTLE BOY 
is watching Ashe from one of the back pews. He clutches a striped ball. He drops it. 
The boy rolls the ball across the floor to Ashe. Ashe kneels and catches it, rolling it back. The boy smiles. 
BOY 
Santa Muerte. 
Unnerved, Ashe retreats out of the sanctuarly, letting the night's shadows swallow him up once more. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT 
Sarah sits by her paintings. Gabriel suddenly stands, arching his back, hair standing on end. 
You go back. 
ASHE 
What if I don't want to go back? 
Sarah looks away. 
SARAH 
Then you're damned 
INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON A VIDEO MONITOR. We're watching the tape documenting Ashe's death. We see Ashe's face sinking beneath the water's surface. The image freezes. 
CURVE (O.S.) 
It was him. It was that son of a bitch we dumped off the pier. I know it. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL Judah, Curve, and Kali gathered around the monitor. Sibyl waits nearby. Curve is snapping open an envelope of Trinity, sniffing up the contents. 
JUDAH 
I thought you killed him. 
CURVE 
I shot him in the head! 
KALI 
He's a ghost. 
CURVE 
No such thing as ghosts. 
KALI 
(POINTEDLY) 
Then who killed Spider Monkey and Nemo? 
Curve starts pacing, growing more apprehensive. 
CURVE 
All I know is, he's fucking with us. The Crow's his symbol, right? That means I'm marked. It means he's coming for me now! 
KALI 
I thought you said you didn't believe? 
Curve turns on Kali, furious, ready to strike her. In a flash, Kali has one of her katanas out. 
Curve backs away, bristling. 
CURVE 
Look, you want to tell yourselves some bullshit fairytales, that's your business. But i'm not gonna sit here with a fucking target on my chest. I'm going to take this motherfucker out! 
SIBYL 
You won't stop him with bullets or knives. He doesn't feel pain. He doesn't bleed. Don't you see? His soul has crossed over. He's come back from the other side. 
Curve looks like he's going to be sick from fear. But Kali and Judah are listening intently.l 
JUDAH 
So how do you stop a man who's already dead? 
SIBYL 
Can you look destiny in the eye without flinching? 
Judah studies Sibyl's shadowed face. 
JUDAH 
You tell me. 
A stare-down ensues. Judah doesn't avert his gaze. 
SIBYL 
The Crow is the source of his power - his link between this world and the next. Sever that link and he's as vulnerable as the next man. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT 
(to Sibyl) 
Can his power be taken? 
SIBYL 
The bird is the key, the life-force that flows within it... 
JUDAH 
(UNDERSTANDING) 
The blood of the Crow. 
Judah whirls around, his eyes glowing with a manic fervor. 
JUDAH 
(to Curve) 
The tattoo on your chest, who gave it to you? 
CURVE 
Some bitch down at the Gargoyle, but what's that got to do with... 
Judah grips Curve's shoulders tightly, shaking him. 
JUDAH 
Everything, you idiot! Find her. If she gave you his mark, then she's connected to him in some way. She can lead us to him. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - DAWN 
Ashe stands at the end of the pier, staring down into the silent waters where his natural life ended. He takes something from his coat... 
THE PAINTING 
which Danny had been working on. It's got bullet holes in it now. 
Ashe throws his arms back and lifts his face to the heavens, SCREAMING, cursing his fate. 
ON ASHE, 
as seen from afar. A tiny figure dwarfed by the endless expanse of ocean and sky. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GRAY GARGOYLE TATTOO SHOP - MOMENTS LATER 
SUPER TITLE: 
"NOVEMBER 1ST - NOCHE DE LOS MUERTOS" 
Curve and Kali have duct-taped Noah to one of the dentist chairs - even his mouth and nose have been sealed shut. Curve lets Noah thrash a moment, then violently rips the tape from Noah's face. 
NOAH 
(frightened, gasping) 
Look, what do you people want? 
CURVE 
A house in the country, a dog, a wife and two kids... 
(GRINS) 
...your fucking head stapled to my saddlebags. 
KALI 
We're looking for Sarah. Where is she, Noah? 
NOAH 
I'm not going to tell you that... 
KALI 
Oh, but I think you are... 
Kali sites astride Noah. She reaches for one of the tattoo machines. She motions to Curve, who hits the treadlight foot switch. Noah eyes the sparking tattoo machine with rising apprehension as Kali moves it towards his face. 
CLOSE ON THE NEEDLE 
a vibrating blur just a few centimeters from Noah's blinking eye. Noah tries to shut his eyes. Kali forces an eye open with the thumb and forefinger of her other hand. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Curve zooms by a bridal shop-sees his own reflection in the window. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Curve SHRIEKS, turns into the Alley, tachometer red-lining. He glances behind him...The crow flies by. 
THE CROW 
plunges down from the night sky, wings flapping madly, quickly gaining on Curve like the breath of death. 
EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT 
Ashe, in a dream-like state, races along. 
EXT. OVERPASS - NIGHT 
Curve leans in low, trying to urge his bike on by will-power alone. He races by a warehouse, veering off the road onto the railroad tracks. 
UP ABOVE, 
Ashe appears on the overpass, riding on his own motorcycle, matching Curve's speed. 
THE CROW 
soars higher for a bird's eye view, tracking Curve's progress as it sweeps past chimneys, swerves around billboards, ducks under laundry lines... 
ON ASHE 
as he ROCKETS along the overpass. The Crow lands on his shoulder. Ahead is a break in the guard rail. Ashe cuts sharply to the right, taking the motorcycle airborne through the break in the rail and... 
ASHE 
...lands on the surface street some thirty feet below! Ashe is now just behind Curve. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT 
Sarah is back at work on the painting of the woman being cradled by her lover. Gabriel, who's lounging nearby, suddenly looks up and HISSES. 
UP ABOVE THEM 
the Crow lands on the skylight, staring down at Sarah, watching... 
There's a KNOCK at her door. Sarah approaches, looks through the peephole... 
SARAH 
Who is it? 
SARAH'S POV (THROUGH FISH-EYE PEEPHOLE) 
Kali stands there, cradling an automatic. She's flanked by TWO IDENTICAL TWIN THUGS. Kali FIRES into the lock... 
EXT. TUNNEL MOUTH - NIGHT 
The chase continues. Curve approaches the bridge doing well past ninety. Abruptly, he cuts down a roadway which parallels the river. There's a chain-link running across the mouth of the tunnel. 
Up ahead is a hole in the fence leading down to a tunnel spillway. Curve guides his bike through the hole... 
INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 
Curve speeds into the dark tunnel, splashing through puddles of water, whipping past graffiti. As he nears the mouth at the other end, Curve brakes hard, TIRES SQUEALING, almost going down... 
CURVE'S POV 
We are now beneath the bridge. It's a stone-cold dead-end. The roadway slopes sharply downward, spilling out into the concrete river bed which is filled to capacity with rushing flood waters. 
BACK TO SCENE 
We hear the ROAR of an approaching motorcycle, then an engine cutting out. Curve looks back the way he came... 
AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE TUNNEL 
Ashe's siilhouette steps into view. He's on foot now, clutching the sawed-off shotgun. He lets loose a LAUGH which chills Curve to the bone. 
ASHE 
"I have a rendezvous with Death, on some scarred slope of battered hill..." 
Ashe starts into the tunnel. His WET FOOTSTEPS echo off the weeping walls... 
ASHE 
"God knows, 'twere better to be deep where love throbs out in blissful sleep, pulse nigh to pulse and breath to breath..." 
As Ashe draws closer, his death-like face emerges from the gloom - a ghastly visage floating in the ether... 
ASHE 
"But I have a rendezvous with Death. And I to my pledged word am true..." 
the petals have clustered around Curve's body in the shape of a Crow. Curve continues to float downstream towards an estuary, borne away on the wings of the bird. 
END OF MOVED SCENE 
INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 
Ashe starts back into the tunnel. He pauses a moment, kneeling down, lowering his head. Whether out of respect for the dead or his own condition, we'll never know. 
After a minute, Ashe lifts his head again and stands. It's time to see his mission through to the end. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 
Ashe is heading back from the river when he's struck by... 
A VISION OF THE CROW'S POV OF SARAH 
ASHE 
is seeing what the crow is witnessing - Sarah in danger. 
ASHE 
Sarah! 
Ashe starts to run, back toward his bike... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT 
Ashe is on the motorcycle, racing through the streets. He takes a corner on a skid, zipping past the Gray Gargoyle and the neighboring train tracks. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT 
Ashe pulls up on the motorcycle, SCREECHING to a stop. He leaps from the bike, rushing into Sarah's building. 
INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT 
Ashe stumbles through the doorway into the loft... 
The loft has been trashed. Furniture turned over, paintings slashed, the ceramic irony mask smashed into pieces... 
ASHE 
(alarmed, desperately looking for her) 
Sarah?! 
KALI (O.S.) 
Sarah's gone, ghost man. 
Ashe whirls around 
KALI 
who had been standing still amidst the shadows, now moves from behind Sarah's paintings. 
ASHE 
Where is she? 
KALI 
Judah's tower. He's waiting for you there. 
As Kali steps closer we see that she's dressed for war -- a katana secured in a black scabbard, twin daggers on each hip, a bandoleer of throwing stars. 
ASHE 
You took my son's life. 
KALI 
(GASPING) 
Some people are born victims. 
ASHE 
It takes two to make a murder. 
Kali unsheathes her katana. The blade edge catches the streetlight's glare coming in from the window. 
KALI 
Shall we dance? 
(SHRUGGING) 
I saw a need, I exploited it. It's all economics, Sarah. Supply and demand. 
SARAH 
Why did you bring me here? 
JUDAH 
I'm glad you asked that, Sarah. You've got a very important part to play in this little drama of ours. You see, I intend to capture the Crow... 
Judah draws near, devouring Sarah with his hungry eyes. USING A JAGGED FINGERNAIL, HE INCISES A CROSS INTO HER FOREHEAD. 
JUDAH (O.S.) 
... and you, my dear, are the birdseed. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SARAH'S LOFT/ALLEY - NIGHT 
Kali comes CRASHING through the window, falling down to the sidewalk below. She lands atop a wrecked car, snapping her back in two... 
CLOSE ON KALI 
lies on the ground, her limbs twisted at awkward angles. She MOANS, somehow still alive. 
KALI'S POV 
as Ashe approaches. The Crow flits in from off-screen, landing on his shoulder. Watching Kali with it's curious golden eyes. 
As Ashe draws near, Kali tries to rise. The most she can do is lift her head. 
KALI 
(GASPING) 
I...can't...move... 
Ashe stares at her, dispassionate. 
KALI 
Kill...me, then...finish...it... 
Ashe simply shakes his head. 
KALI 
You...have to. 
ASHE 
My job is to send you to hell. You're in it. 
Kali stares at Ashe in disbelief, her stoic warrior's mien quickly evaporating. 
KALI 
There's no...honor in this. It's my...death. I've won it.. 
Ashe turns and starts away. 
ASHE 
Me, too. 
KALI 
Wait! Where are you going?! Wait! You can't...do this! You can't do this!!! 
But Ashe doesn't turn back. He leaves Kali in the cold, wet street, ignoring her pathetic laments. 
Ashe continues on to the end of the alley... 
THE CROW 
lands on Ashe's outstretched hand. 
The Crow takes wing, lifting its way up into the night. 
Ashe fires up the motorcycle's engine, tearing away from Sarah's apartment in a cloud of smoke. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT 
The scene resumes. Sarah stares at Judah, horrified. 
SARAH 
EXT. JUDAH'S TOWER - NIGHT 
Ashe Cries out a final time as a GAPING WOUND appears on his chest, BLOOD BLOSSOMING outward. 
CITY STREET 
The Day of the Dead celebrants swirl around us, Judah's Tower rising up behind the mob - an unholy ziggurat built to challenge the gods. The CROWD has been worked up into a frenzy. Everyone is singing and dancing. MUSIC blasts from loudspeakers... 
ASHE 
comes CRASHING DOWN atop a small vending stall filled to the brim with flowers an sugar skulls. Time slows as a flurry of golder marigold petals flutter down around his still form. 
INT. JUDAH'S CAMERA OBSCURA - NIGHT 
The Crow is dead, transfixed by the gleaming misericords. Blood is pooling beneath black flight feathers. 
Judah steps back, momentarily overwhelmed by the enormity of his crime. 
JUDAH 
It's done. 
Judah looks to the camera obscura's table. The blood from the Crow has completely covered the table's concave surface, filling it to the brim like liquid in a shallow bowl. The end result is an eerie reflecting pool. 
AS WE WATCH, THE IMAGE OF THE CLOUDS 
cast by the camera lens onto the table begins to ripple and dissolve, only to be replaced by Judah's own, shimmering reflection. 
BACK TO SCENE 
With a shaking hand, Judah dips his fingers into the pooling blood and begins to paint his face. A swatch of blood over one eye, then a swatch over the other. A long, bloody smear over his lips... 
The action harkens back to the moment when Sarah painted Ashe's face - a parallel ritual turned on its head. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JUDAH'S CAMPANILE - CAMERA OBSCURA - NIGHT 
Judah turns towards us, his transformation now complete. We see that he has painted himself a parody of Ashe's irony mask in the Crow's own blood. 
SARAH 
watches with a mixture of mounting horror and morbid curiousity. 
JUDAH 
scoops up a handful of the Crow's blood and brings it to his lips. 
CLOSE ON JUDAH'S LIPS 
as he drinks, letting the overflow trickle down over his chin and neck. 
CLOSE ON JUDAH'S FACE 
his once-pallid features now glow with a kind of beatific radiance. 
WE RISE UP 
from Judah, up and up into the darkest reaches of his tower. Judah is LAUGHING, laughing in the face of Death itself. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. JUDAH'S TOWER - STREET 
Ashe lies amidst a field of shimmering glass shards and flowers. 
THE MASKED CELEBRANTS 
slowly gather around Ashe, craning their necks for a view of the fallen angel. 
CLOSE ON ASHE'S FACE 
Relaxed, peaceful, even. For a moment, we aren't sure whether or not Ashe's soul has fled. 
The peripheral noise from the street festival dies away. We're in the eye of the hurricane now. Once again, time seems to shudder to a stop. And the only thing we hear are... 
THE CROWS 
Thousands of them, filling the heavens with their KEENING WAILS. 
Ashe slowly opens his eyes, tentative. When you're this deep in the bosom of bliss, the last thing you want to do is waken, but waken he does... 
ASHE'S POV - THE SKY ABOVE JUDAH'S TOWER 
is black with crows. And endless army of carrion-creatures, swirling madly about. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Ashe sits up, stares at the crows, fascinated, frightened. Then his eyes fall to the faces of the people around him. We are in dream-time now, blurring the edges of reality. 
A CHILD 
Now don't we look pretty... 
Ashe struggles, choking, causing... 
THE TATTERED PAINTING 
of Danny's that Ashe had kept in his coat pocket to fall free. It flutters to the ground, landing at Judah's feet. 
Judah kneels, picking it up. As he unfolds the painting, we see that it has been stained with Ashe's own blood. He tilts it this way and that -- as if he were appraising the craftsmanship of the piece. 
JUDAH 
Nice. If you prick him, does he not bleed? 
Judah looks up at Ashe, his eyes full of crazed humor, then he very deliberately tears the painting to shreds, letting the pieces fall away into the night wind. 
Judah reaches for metal rod, lashing out at Ashe's bare, bloodied back... 
WHACK! Ashe SCREAMS. Judah is hell-bent on beating Ashe into oblivion. With every stroke of the switch the crowd CHEERS. 
CLOSE ON ASHE 
His eyes are rolling to whites as consciousness begins to recede... 
ASHE'S POV 
The swirling faces of the masked celebrants, with Judah front and center. Mob mentality, everyone drunk and LAUGHING, jeering at Ashe, the dangling fool. It's a scene out of Hell... 
.. and behind Judah, a familiar figure pushing her way to the front of the crowd... 
SARAH 
lunges forward, clutching the misericord, shoving a reveller aside... 
SARAH 
Get away from him! 
Judah turns. Sarah drives the misericord into Judah's eye. Judah, momentarily blinded, falls back... 
Sarah unlashes the end of the chain from the hydrant... 
ASHE 
falls to the street as the chain CLATTERS over the street lamp. He unravels the chain from his throat and drags himself back up... 
ASHE 
Sarah, get back! 
Too late. Judah has torn the misericord from his eye. He rushes up to Sarah and... 
...THUNK! Drives it deep into her chest. 
ASHE 
SARAH!!! 
Sarah gasps, drops to her knees, clutching at the dagger's handle. She pulls the misericord out. Blood begins to well up from the wound. She stares at her blood-covered hands in disbelief, then falls back. 
Silence now as the crowd begins to back away. The mood has shifted. 
Ashe drops by Sarah's side. She stares up at the sky, eyes wide with wonder... 
SARAH 
The crows...I can see them coming... 
SARAH'S POV 
Once again, the crows are wheeling around the ceiling of the sky. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Ashe looks up at Judah, fueled by a righteous rage that's been burning since the moment of his resurrection. He rises. All reason is gone. The only think that remains for Ashe is an unbridled animal fury. 
Ashe launches himself at Judah, sending the villain tumbling back into a nest of scaffolding. One of the pipes punches clear through Judah's chest, impaling him! 
Judah hangs there, transfixed like a butterfly with a pin stuck through it. He struggles to pull himself from the piping, but even so, he's laughing hysterically... 
JUDAH 
You can't stop me anymore, Ashe. You don't have the power. 
Ashe's eyes boil with hatred. 
ASHE 
If it were just me, you'd be right, Judah. But I have an eternity of pain to call upon... 
Ashe lifts his hands up, exposing his bleeding palms. 
...nothing can keep them apart. 
(her voice fading) 
...nothing. 
Ashe nods, trying to let this thought reassure him. It's the only thing he has left to cling to. 
SARAH'S POV 
Ashe's face, surrounded by a nimbus of light. We're falling away from him. Down, down, down. And as we fall, we hear a FLUTTERING OF WINGS. 
ON SARAH'S FACE 
Her eyes lose focus. Her head goes slack in Ashe's arms. She's gone. 
Ashe lowers his lips to her, kissing her one final time. 
Ashe cradles Sarah's lifeless body in his arms, gently rocking back and forth, tears streaming down his cheeks. 
And as we pull back from them, we realize that the scene mirrors the prophetic image from Sarah's own painting - the woman dying in the arms of her lover, surrounded by a gallery of skull-masked celebrants. 
Ashe stands, lifting Sarah in his arms. He turns to leave... 
THE DAY OF THE DEAD CROWD 
slowly part for him, revealing a path of marigold petals leading away down the street. It's almost as if, by silent consensus, the crowd has come to understand what has happened here this night. 
ASHE 
moves through the crowd carrying Sarah in his arms. The people close ranks behind him and we... 
CUT TO: 
INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMERA OBSCURA - NIGHT 
Sibyl stands over the camera obscura. On the table's focusing surface we see the street below. 
ASHE 
is carrying Sarah in his arms, moving through the crowd of silent witnesses. 
SIBYL 
nods to herself, satisfied. We see what might be a trace of a smile cross her lips. 
Sibyl turns and exits the camera obscura. 
INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT 
Sibyl approaches the table where the stag beetle is tethered. Removing a pair of scissors from within her robes, Sibyl cuts the thread which binds the beetle. 
THE STAG BEETLE, 
free at last, quickly scurries out of the box and across the table, disappearing into the shadows. 
Sibyl follows suit, gathering her robes about her and stepping on into the darkness. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. INNER-CITY CHURCH - DAWN 
The same church we visited the night before. Ashe, still carrying Sarah in his arms, enters the sanctuary. 
The church is aglow with candles. Ashe lays Sarah's body down in front of the offrenda, folding her arms across her chest, leaving her in a state of repose. He stands, taking in one last look. 
As Ashe moves to leave, he sees the elderly priest he had spoken to earlier. 
PRIEST 
Why are you still here? 
ASHE 
Because I have nowhere left to go. 
Ashe steps past the priest, moving towards the doorway and the daylight beyond. 
PRIEST 
What will you do, then? 
ASHE 
(looking back) 
This city is filled with shadows. One more won't make it any darker. 
EXT. CHURCH - DAWN 
Ashe exits the church, finding haven in a shadowed doorway. He reaches into his pocket, removing the wedding ring Sarah had given to him...

FADE IN: 
INT. JEFFERIES' APARTMENT - DAY - LONG SHOT 
Although we do not see the foreground window frame, we see the whole background of a Greenwich Village street. 
We can see the rear of a number of assorted houses and small apartment buildings whose fronts face on the next cross-town street, sharply etched by the morning sun. 
Some are two stories high; others three; some have peaked roofs, others are flat. There is a mixture of brick and wood and wrought iron in the construction. 
The apartment buildings have fire escapes, the others do not. 
The neighborhood is not a prosperous one, but neither is it poor. It is a practical, conventional dwelling place for people living on marginal incomes, luck -- or hope and careful planning. 
The summer air is motionless and heavy with humid heat. 
It has opened windows wide, pushed back curtains, lifted blinds and generally brought the neighborhood life into a sweltering intimacy. Yet, people born and bred to life within earshot and eye glance of a score of neighbors have learned to preserve their own private worlds by uniformly ignoring each other, except on direct invitation. 
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK until a large sleeping profile of a man fills the screen. It is so large that we do not see any features, but merely the temple and side of the cheek down which a stream of sweat is running. 
THE CAMERA PANS OFF this to the right hand side of the window, and MOVES TO a thermometer which is hanging on the wall just outside the window. It registers 84. 
THE CAMERA MOVES ON into the open, and brings nearer to us a room with a large studio window. We are able to see inside this room. A short, balding man is standing near the window, shaving, using a small bowl of water and a portable mirror which he has set up on a shelf. 
To the right of him is a battered upright piano. On top of the piano is a radio. The music selection coming from the radio stops, and the announcer is heard. 
ANNOUNCER The time -- 7:15 A.M., WOR, New York. The temperature, outside, 84 -- Friends -- is your life worth one dollar? 
The man shaving quickly puts down his razor, hurries to the radio, and changes the station, moving past a number of commercial voices until he again finds some music. 
Contented, he returns to his shaving. 
THE CAMERA MOVES ON AND OVER to a far building. It passes over the face of this building until it comes to fire escapes. It goes up and near enough to one which has become the outdoor bedroom of a couple. We are near enough to see an alarm clock hanging from the rail which is now ringing vigorously. A man rises lazily to a sitting position. He gropes to switch the alarm off. 
We see that his pajamas are stained with sweat. In his sitting position he leans forward and shakes somebody beside him. To our surprise, the head of this other person -- a woman -- rises where his feet are. They have been sleeping in opposite directions. They sit limply looking at each other with bedraggled and weary expressions which show they enjoyed very little sleep in the heat of the night. 
THE CAMERA NOW MOVES DOWN toward the left onto another low building. It MOVES IN A LITTLE to a living room window. Just inside the windowsill, a small fan is oscillating. The fan sits on the right side of the table, and to the left of it is an automatic toaster. 
Behind the toaster stands a full-bodied young woman, apparently wearing only a pair of black panties. Her stomach, navel, and the lower part of her chest are naked. Just below her breasts, the curtain, partly drawn, has thrown a deep shadow which extends upward, hiding her breasts, shoulders and head. Two pieces of toast pop up in the toaster. She takes them out, butters them. Then she turns around and bends over another table on which stands an automatic coffee-maker. 
She picks up the coffee-maker, and swings back to the table to sit down. She does this so deftly that her breasts are never exposed, but hidden by the fan as she sits down. The fan moves back and forth as she pours coffee, far enough to reveal that she wears no bra, but not far enough to fulfill the exciting promise of her lack of clothes. 
THE CAMERA MOVES ON to a distant street corner seen between two buildings. The traffic is very light at this hour, but a Sanitation Department truck moves through the intersection spraying water out behind it to cool the pavement and keep the dust down. Three little kids in bathing suits run behind the truck, playing in the water. 
THE CAMERA MOVES OFF and around to some buildings at the side. As it skims this building, we see a hand emerge from one of the windows, and remove the cover from a birdcage which is hanging from a hook on the wall outside. In the cage are two lovebirds -- arguing. 
THE CAMERA NOW PULLS BACK SWIFTLY and retreats through the open window back into Jefferies' apartment. We now see more of the sleeping man. THE CAMERA GOES IN far enough to show a head and shoulders of him. 
He is L. B. JEFFERIES. A tall, lean, energetic thirty five, his face long and serious-looking at rest, is in other circumstances capable of humor, passion, naive wonder and the kind of intensity that bespeaks inner convictions of moral strength and basic honesty. 
He is sitting in an Everest and Jennings wheelchair. 
THE CAMERA PANS along his right leg. It is encased in a plaster of Paris spica from his waistline to the base of his toes. Along the white cast someone has written "Here lie the broken bones of L. B. Jefferies." 
THE CAMERA PANS to a nearby table on which rests a shattered and twisted Speed Graphic Camera, the kind used by fast-action news photographers. 
On the same table, the CAMERA PANS to an eight by ten glossy photo print. It shows a dirt track auto racing speedway, taken from a point dangerously near the center of the track. A racing car is skidding toward the camera, out of control, spewing a cloud of dust behind it. A rear wheel has come off the car, and the wheel is bounding at top speed directly into the camera lens. 
THE CAMERA MOVES UP to a framed photograph on the wall. 
It is a fourteen by ten print, an essay in violence, having caught on film the exploding semi-second when a heavy artillery shell arches into a front-line Korean battle outpost. Men and equipment erupt into the air suspended in a solution of blasted rock, dust and screeching shrapnel. That the photographer was not a casualty is evident, but surprising when the short distance between the camera and the explosion is estimated. A signature in the lower right hand corner of the picture reads -- "L. B. Jefferies." 
THE CAMERA PANS to a second photograph of a picket line at an aircraft plant strike. Strikers, non-strikers and police are embroiled in a bitter and confused riot. 
Clubs, fists and truncheons swing, blood flows, faces twist with emotion and fallen victims struggle to regain their feet. The picture represents no distant, cautions photographic observation, but rather an intimate report, so immediate and real that the viewer has the nervous feeling the fight surrounds him and he had best defend himself. The same signature, "L. B. Jefferies," is in the corner. 
THE CAMERA PANS TO another framed picture, this one a beautiful and awesome shot of an atomic explosion at Frenchman's Flat, Nevada. It is the cul-de-sac of violence. The picture taken at a distant observation point, shows some spectators in the foreground watching the explosion through binoculars. 
THE CAMERA MOVES ON to a shelf containing a number of cameras, photographic film, etc. It then PAN ACROSS a large viewer on which is resting a negative of a woman's head. 
From this, THE CAMERA MOVES ON to a magazine cover, and although we do not see the name of the magazine, we can see the head on the cover is the positive of the negative we have just passed. 
THE CAMERA FINALLY COMES TO REST ON a pile of magazines -- perhaps a hundred or so. They are all of the same publication. 
LAP DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. GUNNISON'S OFFICE - DAY - CLOSE UP 
The screen is filled with the top of a desk. In addition to the usual telephones, blotting pad, etc., the most prominent feature is the number of glossy photo prints, and even larger- sized mat prints. Some of them have slips pasted over with descriptions. The center of the desk is occupied by a large layout of photographs on one magazine page. Behind this we hear the murmur of two voices of men who can be vaguely seen beyond the desk. 
THE CAMERA PANS UP and we are now face to face with IVAR GUNNISON and JACK BRYCE. Gunnison is sitting on a window- ledge, and beyond him we realize we are high above the New York streets. Bryce leans against a wall at right angles to him. 
Gunnison is holding a cablegram in his hand. Bryce has a cigarette in his mouth. He scratches a match, and is about to light it, when he notices that Gunnison, still reading the cable, has reached into an inside shirt pocket, and produced a cigarette. Quickly, Bryce moves over to light Gunnison's cigarette. Then he settles back to light his own. Gunnison doesn't even bother to thank him. 
GUNNISON (Looks up) Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high. 
BRYCE From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there. 
GUNNISON (Stands) This could go off in a month -- or an hour. 
BRYCE I'll pull somebody out of Japan. 
GUNNISON (Heads for his phone) Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town. (Picks up phone) Get me L. B. Jefferies. 
BRYCE (Puzzled) Jefferies? 
GUNNISON (To Bryce; still holding phone) Name me a better photographer. 
STELLA Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause. (Peers at him) What is it? You have a fight? 
JEFF No. 
STELLA (After a pause) Her father loading up the shotgun? 
JEFF Stella! 
STELLA It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say. 
JEFF She's just not the girl for me. 
STELLA She's only perfect. 
JEFF Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want. 
STELLA (Cautiously) Is what you want something you can discuss? 
Jeff gives an exasperated look. 
JEFF It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties. 
STELLA People with sense can belong wherever they're put. 
JEFF Can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank? (Almost to himself) If only she was ordinary. 
Stella sprinkles powder on his back, spreads it around. 
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK as she helps Jeff to a sitting position. He buttons on his shirt. 
STELLA You're never going to marry? 
JEFF Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it. 
THE CAMERA MOVES IN as she helps him into the wheelchair, listening to him with exaggerated attention. He, stops as he notice her attitude. Then he goes on with less conviction: 
JEFF The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else. 
STELLA I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!" 
JEFF (After pause) That's the hard part. 
She swings him around in front of the window. He starts to look out. 
STELLA Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle. 
JEFF There's an intelligent way to approach marriage. 
STELLA (Scoffing) Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble. Modern marriage! 
Jeff swings his chair back to look at her. 
JEFF We've progressed emotionally in -- 
STELLA (Interrupting) Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam 
JEFF People have different emotional levels that -- 
STELLA (Interrupting again) Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz! 
Jeff can't help smiling. 
STELLA When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it. 
JEFF That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich? 
She relaxes. 
STELLA Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her. 
JEFF (Smiles) She pay you much? 
Stella leaves for the kitchen in a huff. Jeff turns his chair to the window. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Jeff now looks out to see what has happened to the old lady, and the man with the flowers. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The elderly lady is now asleep in her deck chair, her face covered with the Herald Tribune. There is no sign of the man with the flowers. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP 
Jeff's eyes travel up to the ballet dancer's window. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
She is sitting near the window looking into an upright mirror. Dreamily, and methodically, she is brushing her long copper- colored hair. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP 
His eyes are suddenly turned in another direction, sharply to his left. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
He is now looking at the windows of the apartments nearest to him. A shade has gone up, and a man, obviously a caretaker is raising a window with some effort. Having accomplished this, he turns back into the room, and we now see him approach a young man and woman who are standing just inside the doorway. He hands a key to the young man, and then obligingly brings in two suitcases which he places on the floor beside them. He gives them a studied, but agreeable nod, then departs. 
We now see that the girl has a small hat with a veil, and an ornate corsage pinned to her light blue tailored suit. The boy, who like the girl is perhaps twenty years old, wears a dark blue serge suit and a grey felt hat. He takes off the hat, and scales it over to a nearby chair. Quickly they are in each other's arms, kissing passionately, crushing the girl's corsage and pushing her hat back a little. They part, the boy laughs nervously, and takes a furtive glance out toward the corridor. He looks back into the room, and beckons her to come out. She follows him wonderingly. For a moment, both are lost from sight. When they reappear, he is carrying her in his arms, over the threshold. He sets her down, closes the door, and they kiss again. 
They part, still holding hands and looking into each other's eyes. Then slowly, and significantly, she looks toward the open window. He releases her hands, goes to the window and pull down the shade, as she is reaching upward with both hands to unpin her hat. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
There is a soft, understanding look on Jeff's face, and he gives an involuntary sigh. He is unaware that Stella is now standing behind him. 
STELLA (Quietly) Window shopper. 
He freezes, turns slowly to look up at her. 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN: 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - SUNSET - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
JEFF You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside? 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - SUNSET - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
She reaches for the doorknob, turns it: 
LISA (Simply) Better than that. The "21." 
She swings open the door and stands to one side. Framed in the doorway is middle-aged waiter wearing a white linen pea jacket with a red collar. He's carrying in one hand a large portable warming oven, and in the other hand an ice bucket containing a bottle of wine covered with a napkin. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - SUNSET - CLOSEUP 
His reaction is one of tender amusement. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - SUNSET - MEDIUM SHOT 
LISA Thank you for waiting Carl. 
He smiles, nods enters. He goes down the stairs, as she follows. THE CAMERA GOES with both of them. 
LISA Kitchen's on the left. I'll take the wine. 
He hands her the wine bucket and she places it on the table. He moves toward the kitchen. 
CARL Good evening, Mr Jefferies. 
JEFF Hello. 
Carl goes into the kitchen. 
LISA (Up, to Carl) Just put everything right in the oven Carl. On "low." 
CARL (Off) Yes ma'am. 
LISA (Enthusiastically) Let's open the wine now. It's a Montrachet. 
JEFF (Appreciatively) A big glassful. 
She moves to a small bar set in the wall cabinet. 
Produces two glasses, hold them up. 
LISA Big enough? 
JEFF Fine. Corkscrew's on the right. 
She finds it. Puts the glasses on the table, uncovers the wine, and begins screwing in the corkscrew. 
LISA I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest. 
JEFF Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving. 
LISA (Struggling with cork) Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget. 
Carl comes out of the kitchen carrying the empty warming oven. He sets it down he sees Lisa struggling with the corkscrew. 
CARL Let me, madam. 
She does. He takes out his own professional corkscrew, quickly inserts it and levers the cork out. He deftly wraps the napkin around the bottle and pours the wine, replacing the bottle in the wine bucket. Lisa has opened her purse to produce some money, in bills. She hands it to the waiter. 
LISA This will take care of the taxi as well. 
Carl, without looking at the money, puts it in his pocket. 
CARL Thank you, Miss Fremont. 
He picks up the warning oven. 
CARL Have a pleasant dinner, Mr. Jefferies. 
JEFF Thank you. 
Carl goes up the stairs and out the door, while THE CAMERA REMAINS on Lisa and Jeff. She picks up both glasses of wine and walks toward Jeff. She seats herself on the windowsill as she hands him his glass. We notice that the outside is considerably darker by now, and the lights are beginning to come on in the various apartments outside. They raise their glasses in a silent toast, and sip the wine. THE CAMERA CLOSES IN until they are both in a tight TOW SHOT. 
LISA What a day I've had! 
JEFF Tired? 
LISA Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show. (Softly, looking up to him) Then I had to dash back and change. 
JEFF (Mock seriousness -- one girl to another) Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing? 
LISA (Seriously) She looked very cool. She had on a mint green -- 
She breaks off with a little laugh, and a slight reproachful look at Jeff. She sips her drink then says: 
LISA And to think, I planted three nice items about you in the columns today. 
Jeff's opinion of that is a short chuckle. 
LISA You can't buy that kind of publicity. 
JEFF That's good news. 
LISA Someday you might want to open up your own studio here. 
JEFF How could I run it from say -- Pakistan? 
She puts down her glass and slides along the window seat nearer to him, THE CAMERA CLOSING IN. She looks up at him with a serious frankness. 
LISA Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment. 
JEFF I wish there was one I wanted. 
LISA Make the one you want. 
JEFF (As if he can't believe her) You mean leave the magazine? 
LISA Yes. 
JEFF For what? 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI LONG SHOT 
Jeff tries to be pleasant, and offhand. 
JEFF Well -- when'll I see you again? 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Lisa, standing in the open doorway. 
LISA Not for a long time. Not, at least until -- (She begins smiling) -- tomorrow night. 
Continues smiling as she close the door softly behind her. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
The pleasantness on Jeff's face slowly melts into baffled discouragement. He reaches for a nearby phone picks up the receiver, dials. It buzzes on filter. 
Receiver up on filter. 
GUNNISON (Filter) Hello. 
JEFF Gunnison? 
GUNNISON Yeah. Is that you, Jeff? 
JEFF It's me. 
GUNNISON Something wrong? 
JEFF The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday? 
GUNNISON (Unhappy) Jeff -- 
JEFF (Won't give him time to argue) I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it. 
GUNNISON (Wearily, after pause) Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up. 
JEFF That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy. 
GUNNISON Yeah. 
Jeff hangs up, looks up to the door through which Lisa left. He's not particularly happy. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Jeff returns to the window. He lights a cigarette and smokes it peacefully, as he contemplates the neighborhood. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The CAMERA slowly sweeps over the various apartments with an odd window lit here and there. In the distant street there is still some traffic passing, with one or two pedestrians going by. THE CAMERA completes its sweep, and starts to move back again. Somewhere a dog howls. The PANNING CAMERA comes to a sudden halt. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Jeff smiles a little, but as the howl continues, his expressions sobers. His eyes begin to scan the neighborhood, as if looking for the source. He fails to find it, and sits there, puzzled and disturbed. The scene, and the sound of the dog: 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN: 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Jeff's chair is turned facing the window so that we see the darkened room behind him. There is just one side light burning, which illuminates the side of his face. 
His head nods sleepily as he dozes. He opens his eyes and looks out, as a slight sound of rain starts. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - LONG SHOT 
From his viewpoint we see the first few drops of rain starting to fall. It is sort, gentle rain, not a downpour. There are still some windows lit in the neighborhood. The apartment house corridors all have small night lights burning. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Jeff wakens a little more fully as his attentions is drawn to: 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
The couple who sleep on the fire escape. The increasing rain cause them to hastily gather their things to retreat inside. The man, hurriedly untying the alarm clock from the railing of the fire escape, lets it slip through his fingers. As if falls to the garden below, the CAMERA FANS SWIFTLY down with it. When the clock hits the ground, the alarm goes off sending a shrill sound through the neighborhood. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Jeff smiles at the incident, and then lowers his eyes slightly as something else catches his attention. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
Coming out of his apartment into the corridor on the floor below is the salesman with the nagging wife. The shades are drawn in his apartment, but a light burns dimly behind them. The salesman carries a large aluminum suitcase -- the same one we saw him with earlier in the day. The sound of the alarm startles him. He turns toward the window a moment listening. Then reassured that is is nothing important, he turns and moves down the corridor. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Jeff is puzzled. He looks down a moment in thought. Then he darts his eyes and swings them toward the left. 
He looks steadily toward the distant street corner. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The street corner, lighted by a lamp, is deserted. A moment later, the salesman, still carrying the suitcase, moves diagonally across the corner, head down against the rain. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Jeff looks wonderingly at this nocturnal activity. Then he looks down at his wristwatch. 
INSERT 
Jeff's watch reads 1:55. 
QUICK FADE OUT: 
QUICK FADE IN: 
INSERT 
The watch now reads 2:35. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
JEFF I was. 
STELLA (Massaging harder) What'll you do if one of them catches you? 
JEFF Depends one which one. 
She stops massaging, reaches for the oil. 
JEFF Now Miss Torso, for example -- 
Stella hits his back with a palmful of cold oil. It takes his breath. 
STELLA Keep your mind off her. 
JEFF She's real eat, drink and be merry girl. 
STELLA And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable. 
JEFF Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone. 
STELLA Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness. 
JEFF And some man will lose his. 
STELLA Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction? 
JEFF Well, the salesman could be available soon. 
STELLA (Interested in the scandal) He and his wife splitting up? 
JEFF It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case. 
STELLA (So?) Isn't he a salesman? 
JEFF Now what could he sell at three in the morning? 
STELLA (Shrugs) Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up. 
JEFF He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain. 
She helps him to a sitting position. 
STELLA His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward. 
JEFF Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run. 
STELLA (Looks at him) But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it. 
Jeff turns his head away for a moment. She helps him into the chair. Hands him his shirt, which he proceeds to put on. The back of his chair is to the window. 
STELLA (Putting oil and power away) What about this morning? Any developments? 
JEFF No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment. 
STELLA (stops) In this heat? (Turns, looks over his shoulder) They're up now. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
He quickly turns his wheelchair around to the window until he is in profile. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The salesman, having just raised the shades in the living room, is now looking out the window. It is not a casual look, but a long, careful, searching appraisal of all the apartment house windows in his neighborhood, starting from his left to his right. His eyes move closer toward Jeff's apartment. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT 
Jeff in his chair, facing the window, Stella beside him. Jeff nearly knocks the startled Stella off her feet with his arm. 
JEFF Get back! Out of sight! Quick! 
He propels his chair backward quickly, and Stella moves to the side with surprising agility. They are both in shadow. 
STELLA (A startled whisper) What is it? What's the matter? 
Jeff keeps his eyes trained on the window. 
JEFF (Quietly) The salesman's looking out his window. 
Stella relaxes, gives Jeff a disgusted look, and starts to move out of the shadows. 
STELLA A Federal offense. 
JEFF (Sharply) Get back there! He'll see you! 
She moves back into the shadows. 
STELLA I'm not shy. I've been looked at before. 
JEFF (Still peering toward window) It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The salesman completes his searching glance at the neighborhood. Then something directly below his window catches his attention. He looks sharply downward, his body visibly tensing. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT 
Jeff, with a restraining hand to Stella, begins to edge his chair cautiously forward so that he can see what the salesman is looking at. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
THE CAMERA MOVES FORWARD, and as it reaches the edge of the window, PANS DOWN and shows us what the salesman is looking at. The little dog that was lowered in the basket is sniffing at the salesman's personal flower bed. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP 
Jeff's eyes move up quickly to look at the salesman. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The salesman leans forward and grips the window sill as he watches the dog. The CAMERA PANS DOWN and we now see that the old lady with the hearing aid is leaning over the fence admonishing the dog. We can faintly hear her voice saying something to the effect that he'll get into trouble. The dog turns to glance at her and apparently taking heed, moves away. The old lady is wearing a faded house-robe. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP 
Jeff is amused at the dog incident. Behind him, Stella moves to the center of the room, saying: 
LISA Well, "ain't I?" -- Pay attention to me. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - TWO SHOT 
We are now able to see that Jeff's apartment is in darkness, only faintly lit from the distant light of the neighbors' window. By her position, Lisa is seated on Jeff's sound knee, her arms around his neck. 
JEFF I'm not exactly on the other side of the room. 
LISA Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him. 
She starts kissing him. 
JEFF Don't you ever have any problems? 
LISA (Murmurs, kissing him) I have one now. 
JEFF So do I. 
LISA (Kissing) Tell me about it. 
JEFF (Slight pause) Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times? 
LISA He likes the way his wife welcomes him home. 
JEFF Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today? 
LISA Homework. It's more interesting. 
JEFF What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper? 
LISA Nothing, thank heaven. 
JEFF (Looking again) Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day? 
LISA I wouldn't dare answer that. 
JEFF (After pause) Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong. 
She gives up trying to interest him in romance, and moves back from the embrace. THE CAMERA PULL BACK. 
LISA And I'm afraid it's with me. 
Lisa stands, straightens out her dress, stretches a little then she turns to the divan, apparently not too interested in his observation about the salesman's life. 
JEFF (Looks at Lisa) What do you think? 
LISA (Without returning his look) Something too frightful to utter. 
Jeff is thoughtful for a moment, then he relaxes and smiles a little. He turns to the window to look out again. Lisa exits the picture. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
Lisa stretches herself out on the divan. Her head rest on the cushion at the far end, and she instinctively falls into an attractive pose. However, her expression is disturbed as she watches Jeff. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
He stares intently out the window. 
JEFF He went out a few minutes ago -- in his undershirt -- and he hasn't come back yet. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Lisa weighs this information, trying to make some sense out of it. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Jeff turns his eyes from the salesman's apartment, and looks down reflectively. He looks up again, and then his eyes catches sight of something. He leans forward slightly. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
Miss Torso is lying, face down, on her divan bed. The only light in the apartment is from a reading lamp. She is reading a book held in one hand, while eating a sandwich in another. 
Her back is bare, and all she wears is a pair of brief dark blue shorts. At one point, she lifts her torso up slightly to brush crumbs out from beneath her. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
He looks away from Miss Torso, thoughtfully. 
JEFF You know -- that would be terrible job to tackle. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Lisa leans forward and looks out the window to see what Jeff is referring to. She turns back to him with a blank stare. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Jeff turns and looks at her, quite unaware of her surprise at his comment. 
JEFF How would you begin to cut up a human body? 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
Lisa sits bolt upright on the divan. She reaches back quickly and pulls on the overhead light. At that moment the songwriter returns to his composing. We can see him over Lisa's shoulder. He is beginning his song again, and it has taken on new fullness and melody. 
Although it is not complete, it is farther along then before, and he plays his theme a number of different ways, trying to move it note by note to its completion. 
Lisa just stares at Jeff for a moment. 
LISA Jeff -- I'll be honest with you -- you're beginning to scare me a little. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Jeff is staring out of the window again. Over this we hear Lisa's voice: 
LISA (Quietly insistent) Jeff -- did you hear what I said? You're beginning to -- 
Jeff puts out a restraining hand. 
JEFF (Interrupting) Be quiet! Shhh! (Pause) He's coming back! 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
At last the salesman is seen coming along the corridor. 
From Jeff's viewpoint, all the windows are dark. The couple are sleeping on the fire escape. The salesman's apartment is dark as well. Suddenly a match flares, and we see the salesman light a cigar. The flame of the match illuminates his face for a moment. When is dies out, we see just the glow of the cigar burning. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
The CAMERA is now facing Jeff. We see that his left hand rests on the telephone receiver which is close to him. The phone starts to RING, but makes only the slightest sound, as he instantly picks it up. As he talks, in a low voice, he keeps his eyes on the salesman's apartment. 
JEFF Yeah? 
INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
We get an impression of Sixth Avenue behind Lisa at the phone. Lisa also talks in a low, quiet voice. 
LISA The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald. 
JEFF (Filter) What's the apartment house number? 
LISA 125 West Ninth Street. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Jeff, still looks toward the salesman's apartment. 
JEFF Thanks, Lisa. 
INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Lisa smilingly says: 
LISA Okay, chief. What's my next assignment. 
JEFF To get on home. 
LISA All right -- but what's he doing now? 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Jeff is still looking toward the salesman's apartment. 
JEFF Just sitting in the living room. In the dark. And he hasn't gone near the bedroom. Now get some sleep. Goodnight. 
He puts the receiver down, and resumes his vigil. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - LONG SHOT 
All we can see is the glow of the salesman's cigar. 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN: 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT 
Jeff is seated by the window in his wheelchair. He is talking on the telephone while his eyes are still on the neighborhood. There is a touch of urgency in his voice. 
JEFF Look, Doyle -- it's just one of those things I can't tell you on the phone. You have to be here, and see the whole set-up. 
The CAMERA PULLS BACK slightly as Stella emerges from the kitchen. She is carrying a tray with breakfast on it. Eggs, bacon, toast and coffee. 
JEFF It's probably nothing important -- just a little neighborhood murder, that's all. As a matter of fact, I did say "murder". 
Stella squeezes past the right side of Jeff, and places the food tray on a windowseat in front of him. She peers out cautiously toward Thorwald's apartment for a moment. Then she squeezes back, moving to the sideboard against which leans a small table on an adjustable stand. 
JEFF My only thought was to throw a little business your way. A good detective, I reasoned, would jump at the chance to detect. 
Stella returns with the table, and sets it up so that it is across Jeff's lap. She gets the tray of food pausing to look toward Thorwald's apartment. Then she places the breakfast on the tray table in front of Jeff. He has moved back a little to avoid getting the phone cable tangled in the food and dishes. 
JEFF Well, I usually took my best pictures on my day off. (nods) Okay, Doyle -- soon as you can. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
He hangs up. Stella takes the phone and puts it down for him. He looks at the breakfast, reaches for a knife and fork. 
JEFF Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you. 
STELLA Police? 
JEFF (Pauses in cutting food) Huh? 
STELLA You called the police? 
JEFF Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend. (Almost to himself) An old, ornery friend. 
He begins eating, appreciatively. She moves behind his chair, pausing to look toward Thorwald's apartment again. Jeff is just lifting a piece of bacon to his lips when Stella speaks. 
STELLA (Half to herself) Now just where do you suppose he cut her up? 
The hand carrying the bacon to Jeff's mouth hesitates for a moment. 
STELLA (Answering herself) Oh -- of course! In the bathtub. That's the only place he could wash away the blood. 
The hand holding the bacon moves back to the plate. 
Jeff just stares ahead. Stella turns and walks into the kitchen. Jeff pushes the food away, and picks up the coffee cup instead. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP 
Jeff's eyes, over the coffee cup, are staring intently at the backyard. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
Thorwald's apartment. The shades up. No one moving. 
The rope-tied trunk still sits in the bedroom. 
To the left we see the basket lowering with the dog in it. We HEAR the woman WHISTLING an aria. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP 
His eyes stray in an upward direction as he puts down the coffee cup. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The CAMERA PANS UP past the woman lowering the dog, up to the roof where one of the sunbathers can be seen sitting up, rubbing her body with sun tan oil. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Jeff quickly puts the glasses up. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - BINOCULAR SHOT 
By the time the binoculars are up, another truck has crossed from the left. In momentarily blocks out the side of our freight truck. By the time the two trucks part, we can only see the back half of the freight truck before it pulls out of sight. Jeff is only able to read the words "FREIGHT LINES". The binoculars are held for a moment until we see a puffing and blowing Stella arrive at the opening of the alleyway. She looks toward the front of Thorwald's apartment house. 
And by her attitude we can see that there is no truck outside. She looks about her for a moment. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP 
Jeff lowers the binoculars, discouraged. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - LONG SHOT 
The figure of Stella is seen, looking up toward Jeff's apartment, and arms outspread in a helpless gesture. 
LAP DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
SHOOTING TOWARDS the big window, with the neighborhood beyond, Jeff is as usual seated in his wheelchair on the left of the window, but now turned toward a newcomer. 
The second man is standing near the divan looking out the window with the binoculars. This newcomer is POLICE DETECTIVE LIEUTENANT THOMAS J. DOYLE, the man Jeff phoned earlier in the day. He is an intelligent-appearing, well-dressed modern detective. He has a sense of humor. He lowers the glasses, and turns to Jeff. 
DOYLE You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder? 
JEFF Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more. 
DOYLE I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely. 
JEFF Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand. 
Doyle paces a little. 
DOYLE It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there -- (He points) -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up. 
JEFF Well, officer -- do your duty. 
DOYLE You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage. 
JEFF I'll bet it's been done. 
DOYLE Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked. 
JEFF (A pause) You think I made all this up? 
DOYLE I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation. 
JEFF For instance? 
DOYLE (Shrugs) His wife took a trip. 
JEFF She -- was -- an -- invalid! 
DOYLE You told me. (Looks at watch) I've got to run, Jeff. 
JEFF All right -- you don't believe me. 
Doyle saunters toward steps, picking up his hat on the way. Stops. 
DOYLE I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity. 
JEFF (Coldly) Thanks. 
DOYLE We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where. 
JEFF Do that. 
He goes up the steps to the door, putting on his hat. 
He pauses his hand on the door knob. 
DOYLE You have any headaches lately? 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Jeff answers, showing only the slightest irritation. 
JEFF Not 'til you showed up. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Doyle, still at the door: 
DOYLE Uh-huh. Well, it'll wear off in time -- along with the hallucinations. See you around. 
He starts to go out the door, and closes it behind him. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
From Doyle's viewpoint. Jeff lifts his hand in a feeble parting gesture. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Before the door has completely closed, Doyle opens it again, and looks in. 
DOYLE By the way  what happened to your leg? 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
JEFF I was jaywalking. 
DOYLE'S VOICE (O.S.) Where? 
JEFF (With nonchalance) The Indianapolis Speedway. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
The door starts to close again, as if Doyle considered Jeff's answer quite reasonable. Then the door pops open and Doyle's head comes in, a surprised expression across his face. 
DOYLE During the race? 
JEFF Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence. 
DOYLE I can't do that. 
JEFF I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him. 
DOYLE I can't do it even if he's gone. 
JEFF (With sarcasm) What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department? 
DOYLE Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes! 
JEFF Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear. 
DOYLE At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence. 
JEFF Give him evidence. 
DOYLE I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --" (He shakes his head "no") He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes. 
JEFF By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment. 
DOYLE (Looking out window) A detective's nightmare. 
JEFF What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door? 
DOYLE (Looking out window) One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer! 
DOYLE (Turns and look at Jeff) How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years? 
JEFF You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question? 
DOYLE Ever get an answer? 
JEFF Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: "Your request for transfer turned down --" 
He can't help smiling, and neither can Doyle. 
DOYLE Sorry I had to turn it down. (He checks his watch) I'm going over to the railroad station and check Thorwald's story. 
He moves to the sideboard, picks up a felt hat. 
JEFF Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it! 
DOYLE Oh -- I almost forgot! 
He pulls a slip of paper out of his pocket. Jeff watches him intently. 
DOYLE (Looking at Jeff) There was a postcard in Thorwald's mailbox. (Refers to paper) Mailed yesterday afternoon, three- thirty P.M. from Merritsville -- (Looks up, speaks pleasantly) -- That's eighty miles north of here. (Back to paper) The message read "Arrived O.K. Already feeling better. Love, Anna." 
He looks at Jeff with some smugness. 
JEFF (Slowly) Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is? 
DOYLE (Nods "yes") Mrs. Thorwald. 
He puts on his hat, and goes toward the door. 
DOYLE (Maliciously) Anything you need?

Jeff is sober. 
JEFF Yeah. A good detective.

INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - CLOSEUP 
The sun has just set. THE CAMERA is concentrating on the long-focus lens camera which fills the screen. Just beyond, there is a plate on which a solitary sandwich. 
Jeff's hand comes in, picks it up. We PAN US with the sandwich until Jeff's head fills the screen. (Except for a small light in the kitchen, Jeff's apartment is in darkness.) As he munches, he keeps his attention on the neighborhood. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
Thorwald's apartment is darkness. THE CAMERA PANS slightly to the left, as we see the dog being lowered in its basket. We follow the basket down to the yard which brings Miss Lonely Heart's apartment into view. She is wearing a Kelly Green suit, and is seated at her dressing table. She seems to be putting on the final touches of her make-up, prior to going out. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - CLOSEUP 
Jeff looks down, he smiles to himself. He turns, and we see him raise the long-focus camera to his eye. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - CAMERA SHOT 
The long-focus lens brings Miss Lonely Hearts into an enlarged picture which reveals details we have not previously noticed. 
A pair of ill-fitting, horn-rimmed reading glasses rest half way down her nose, and she has to tilt her head back slightly as she applies lip-stick, with their aid. 
Satisfied, she takes off the glasses, and examines her face as a whole, through squinting eyes. She has faded good looks, has fairly nice clothes, but is badly in need of advice on hair dressing. Her hair-do makes her seem middle-aged. She reaches for a tall glass of liquor next to her, and takes a long drink. Putting the glass down, she squints to see if she has disturbed the lipstick. Unable to see clearly, she puts on the glasses again, looks, and touches up her lips slightly. 
She puts her glasses in a handbag, then stands to put out the lights. She walks into the living room, finishing the drink. The long-focus lens moves with her. She goes straight for a bottle of liquor, and pours out a final neat slug, and tosses it off. Then she leaves the apartment, with a show of determination. 
She turns out the lights behind her. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Jeff lowers the long-focus lens, and turns his head to the right as he hears the first notes of the songwriter's melody which we have heard him trying to complete. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - MEDIUM SHOT 
The songwriter is at the piano, poking out his melody, slowly, note by note. He is in black tie, and from the looks of the apartment he is preparing for guests. An attractive girl is setting out trays of canapés, glasses, ice and liquor. She pauses as she crosses the room carrying a tray of food. She listens a moment to the songwriter's melody. Her expression shows that it pleases her, and moves her romantically. She comments on it to the songwriter, who starts from the beginning again, playing it more fully. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
A new source of music comes in to interfere with the piano playing. It is orchestral ballet music, in a modern style. Jeff's head turns in this new direction. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
Miss Torso, and a male partner whom we have not seen before, are practicing a pas a deux. He is a tall flowing-haired young man, lithe and graceful beyond normal masculine capacity. 
They stop, at one point, to listen to a word of comment from a woman who is watching. By her gestures, she is obviously a professional choreographer. 
THE CAMERA PANS from this to the street beyond. 
The lights are out in Thorwald's bedroom, and Thorwald is in the act of pouring himself out a drink in the living room. He comes to the window, glass in hand, and looks down into the garden, nonchalantly. Over this, we HEAR Lisa's voice, questioningly: 
LISA It doesn't seem to be in any hurry. 
JEFF (Stares out the window, exasperated) He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's -- 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
He stops, turns to her quickly. 
JEFF That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost -- 
LISA What about it? 
JEFF He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone. 
LISA Someone not his wife? 
JEFF I never saw him ask her for advise before. (Smiles) But she volunteered plenty. 
Jeff turns back to the window. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
Thorwald is standing at the window with his drink in his hand. Then he turns, puts his unfinished drink down on a table, and goes to the door. He puts the light out in the living room and goes out the door. He walks briskly down the corridor. 
LISA I wonder where he's going now? 
JEFF I don't know. 
LISA Suppose he doesn't come back again? 
JEFF He will. All his things are still piled on the bed. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
Lisa moves toward a nearby lamp. 
LISA Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now. 
JEFF (Looking to left) Not yet! 
He picks up the long-focus lens and trains it on the street intersection, as Lisa moves back to him. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - CAMERA SHOT - NIGHT 
The street intersection. Some traffic, mostly pedestrian. Miss Lonely Hearts still sitting at the cafe table, alone. Drinking. There is no sign of Thorwald. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
He lowers the lens. 
JEFF He must have gone somewhere to the right. 
The CAMERA PULLS BACK as Lisa starts around the apartment turning on the lights. As she light increases, we see that she is wearing another extravagantly beautiful dress. She seems quite animated, moving gracefully, her skirt and hair swinging with her movement. Jeff turns around to face the room. 
LISA All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work. 
JEFF Thinking about Thorwald? 
LISA (Nods yes) And you, and you friend Doyle -- (Stops, to Jeff) Did you hear from him again -- since he left? 
JEFF Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it. 
As he talks, she seems to be thinking something over to herself. He starts pacing, trying to distill her thoughts. We see that she has brought an oversized handbag with her, which lies prominently on the table. 
Jeff watches her. 
JEFF Something on your mind, Lisa? 
LISA It doesn't make sense to me. 
JEFF What doesn't? 
LISA Women aren't that unpredictable. 
JEFF (Losing a little patience) Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking. 
THE CAMERA CLOSES IN, Lisa stops, faces him. Her eyes sparkle, and her body is tense with concentration. 
LISA A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why? 
JEFF Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag. 
THE CAMERA eases back. 
LISA But only her husband would know that. (Starts to pace again) And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up. 
JEFF Do they hide it in their husband's clothes? 
LISA They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry. 
JEFF Inside stuff? 
LISA Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag. 
JEFF I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that. 
LISA That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband? 
JEFF That's what the witnesses told him. 
LISA Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women. 
JEFF Still -- those witnesses. 
LISA We'll agree they saw a woman -- but she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That is, yet. 
She comes over to Jeff. He reaches up, takes her hand. 
JEFF Come here. 
He pulls her into his lap. She puts her arms around him. She is very happy, and kisses Jeff's cheek. 
Doyle reaches for a cigarette on the table, and puts it to his lips. While searching his pockets for a match, he HEARS Lisa humming. His eyes turn upward. 
MEDIUM SHOT 
Over the cabinet which divides the living room from the kitchen, we can see a glimpse of Lisa's shadow on the ceiling.

Jeff, has followed Doyle's look.

Jeff. His eyes turn from the lingerie up to Doyle.

Doyle's look is completely noncommittal. His eyes turn at the sound of the song-writer's party. He moves forward to get a better view, as the CAMERA RETREATS in front of him. He stops to glance out of the window. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
The party is now full progress. The room is overcrowded. And some people are now sitting on the floor with their backs to the window. Others are outside. A crowd hides the piano player, but music can be head competing with the babble. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Doyle turns his head away, and looks straight out. His expression hardens a little, as he sees: 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The window of Thorwald's apartment, completely dark. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
He also is looking toward Thorwald's apartment. He turns his eyes anxiously back to Doyle. He seems to be trying to penetrate Doyle's mind. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
Doyle turns his head from the window, and looks down at Jeff. He asks, quietly: 
DOYLE What else do you have on this man Thorwald? 
Jeff's tension eases off a little, by he is eager to talk. 
JEFF Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him. 
DOYLE (Soberly) You think he's getting out of here? 
JEFF Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing. 
Doyle looks back toward Thorwald's bedroom. We see the dark apartment beyond him. Doyle nods thoughtfully. He turns his head suddenly at the sound of Lisa coming out of the kitchen. She holds two large brandy snifters containing some brandy. They are cupped in her hand, the stem between her fingers. She is rotating them gently toward the body to warm the brandy. She is quite beautiful. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Doyle reacts to her appreciatively. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
She continues rotating the brandy. 
LISA I'm just warming some brandy. 
She comes forward hands one snifter to Jeff. She offers the second to Doyle. (NOTE: In the following set of scenes, whenever anyone holds a brandy snifter, it is being rotated- regardless of their attitudes.) 
LISA Mr. Doyle? -- I presume. 
Doyle sort of smiles, and takes the snifter awkwardly. 
JEFF Tom, this is Miss Lisa Fremont. 
Doyle bows his head slightly, but his eyes remain on her in a fixed stare. 
DOYLE How do you do? 
Lisa smiles in return. 
LISA We think Thorwald's guilty. 
She turns around, and goes right back into the kitchen. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Doyle stares after her, ignoring her remark, still not recovered from the fist sight of her attractiveness. 
Then quickly, his eyes move down and to the left. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

JEFF (Cautiously) Careful, Tom. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Doyle's eyes travel past Jeff to look out the window. 
He still holds the brandy snifter in one hand, and a cigarette in the other. Absentmindedly he still rotates the brandy. The SOUND of the phone ringing is heard.

INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Doyle comes up to the CAMERA, looking at Lisa. 
DOYLE Look, Miss Fremont. That feminine intuition sells magazines -- but in real life, it's still a fairy tale. I don't know how many wasted years I've spent running down leads based on women's intuitions. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Jeff is resentful of Doyle's comments to Lisa. 
JEFF I take it you didn't find the trunk -- And this is just an old speech you once gave at the Policeman's Ball. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Doyle has turned away into the center of the room. He swings around. 
DOYLE I found the trunk -- a half hour after I left here. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Lisa speaks again with continuing sarcasm: 
LISA Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope. 
DOYLE (Off) When the lock is broken -- yes. 
JEFF What was in the trunk? A surly note to me? 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Doyle comes toward the CAMERA again. 
DOYLE (Carefully) Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable. 
LISA (Off) Didn't you take it to the crime lab? 
Doyle gives her a scathing look. 
DOYLE I sent it on its merry and legal way. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Jeff challenges Doyle: 
JEFF Why -- when a woman only goes on a simple trip, does she take everything she owns? 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Doyle, with a studied, gracious gesture, to Lisa. 
DOYLE Let the female psychology department handle that one. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Lisa answers, but very coldly: 
LISA I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back. 
DOYLE (Off) That's what they call a family problem. 
JEFF (Persisting) If his wife wasn't coming back -- why didn't he tell his landlord? -- I'll answer it for you -- because he had something to hide.

DOYLE (Blandly) Do -- uh -- you tell your landlord everything?

JEFF I told you to be careful. 
Lisa looks down at Jeff, not comprehending.

Doyle points to one of the photographs on the wall. 
DOYLE If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money -- 
JEFF (Expressionless) All the things I hate. 
Doyle has a complete change of manner. He relaxes and smiles. 
DOYLE Now -- what do you say we sit down to a quiet, friendly drink or two -- forget all about this, and tell lies about the old days in the war? Hmmm? He looks from one to the other. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Neither Jeff or Lisa display even the slightest friendliness. Their faces are cold and set. Then Lisa speaks, icily: 
LISA You're through with the case? 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Doyle is relaxed. 
DOYLE There isn't any "case" to be through with, Miss Fremont. Now let's get down to that friendly drink. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Jeff and Lisa remain unmoved. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
LISA I'm not much on rear window ethics. 
JEFF Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to. 
LISA (Turns to him) Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see. 
JEFF Huh? 
LISA You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known. 
Jeff starts to smile at the realization. 
LISA You'd think we could be a little bit happy that the poor woman is alive and well. 
Jeff smile is broad, and he starts to chuckle. She relaxes and joins him. She sits on his lap, her arms around his shoulders. 
LISA Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor." 
JEFF I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start? 
She gets up, goes to the blinds, and proceeds to lower them one by on. 
LISA (As she get up) Not if I have to move into an apartment across the courtyard and do the dance of the seven veils once an hour. (As she lowers the blinds) Show's over for tonight. 
He smiles. She goes to the table, picks up he overnight case. 
LISA Preview -- of the coming attractions. 
She goes to the kitchen entrance, pauses. 
LISA Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case. 
JEFF (Mock seriousness) No, Lisa -- I don't think he did. 
She shrugs, goes into the kitchen, the CAMERA PANNING her. 
LAP DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Jeff is sitting on the wheelchair near the bar, a drink in his hand. He starts to take a sip from the glass, when Lisa comes out of the kitchen. She is an ethereal beauty, in sheer peach nightgown, covered by a gossamer matching kimono. She turns gracefully in front of Jeff. 
He lowers his drink. 
LISA (Softly) What do you think? 
Jeff puts his drink on the bar. He tries to decide how to answer her question. He can't. 
LISA I'll rephrase the question. 
JEFF Thank you. 
Lisa holds out the folds of her kimono. 
LISA Do you like it? 
JEFF (Studying it) Well, -- if there was one less thread this way -- (motions horizontally) -- and two less that way -- (Motions vertically) -- I might give up bachelorhood. 
Lisa turns playfully toward the kitchen. 
LISA I'll be right back. 
Blood-curdling scream from the courtyard outside suddenly cuts through the night. 
Startled, both Jeff and Lisa move quickly for the window -- Lisa lifting the blinds up. The long scream subsides into near-hysterical sobbing. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - LONG SHOT 
We get a high comprehensive view of all the apartments. 
Light are going on in some windows, shades are lifted on others, people are beginning to lean out looking for the source of the cream and sobbing. The song-writer's party comes to a sudden halt, as his guest crowd to the window. 
SEMI-LONG SHOT 
Lisa and Jeff at the window, looking out, startled. 
SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The landlord, beneath the newlyweds, looks out. Tilting his head up toward the center of the yard. 
SEMI-LONG SHOT 
A couple comes out on the high balcony to the right. 
Look down. 
MEDIUM SHOT 
The newlywed's blinds come up, and for the first time we see both of them at the window, the girl looking over the boy's shoulder. 
SEMI-LONG SHOT 
Some members of the song-writer's party move out to the patio- balcony, to get a better look down in the yard. 
SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The bird woman comes to the window. Her white face looks forward toward the center of the courtyard. 
SEMI-LONG SHOT 
Miss Torso, pulling a around her, comes out onto her porch, and looks to her left. 
SEMI-LONG SHOT 
Miss Hearing aid comes quickly into her backyard. 
SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The couple who own the dog are standing on their fire escape. They are both looking down, but while the husband is quiet, the wife is holding her hands to the side of her head, sobbing loudly. We have heard her sobbing since the moment of the scream which she uttered. 
SEMI-LONG SHOT 
Lying near the sidewalk in the backyard below the couple's fire escape, is the silent body of the little dog they own. Miss Lonely Hearts comes running out of the basement door. She goes directly to the dog, picks it up in her arms. Then she slowly turns and looks up at the sobbing woman above her. 
Stella also turns, interrupting her 
STELLA Nobody's invented polite words yet for killing. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - CLOSEUP 
Jeff, who is still staring out the window, has a look of sudden discovery on his face. He calls quickly: 
JEFF Lisa -- Lisa -- on the shelf over there -- get me the small yellow box -- 
He turns halfway around, and points. We see Lisa moving behind him toward the shelf. He adds: 
JEFF And that little viewer. 
He turns back to the window, holding out his right hand to the side, waiting for the box and viewer. The CAMERA PULLS BACK a little as Lisa comes up, and places the box and viewer in his hand. He opens the box, which contains color slides, and holds one or two of the slides up to the light. Lisa looks down at him curiously and Stella comes forward from the background. 
JEFF (Half to himself as he searches slides) These aren't more than two weeks old -- I hope I didn't take all leg art. (Discovers the right slide) I think this is the one. 
Puts the other slides to one side and puts the selected one onto the viewer, with sounds of satisfaction. As he lifts the viewer to his eyes Lisa asks impatiently: 
LISA Jeff -- what are you looking for? 
He squints out through the viewer, then looks away a moment without it. 
JEFF Something -- that if I'm right -- might solve a murder. 
He looks back through the viewer. 
STELLA Mrs. Thorwald? 
JEFF Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it. 
He takes the viewer from his eye, hands it to Lisa. 
JEFF You take a look and tell me what you see. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - CLOSEUP 
Lisa raises the viewer to her eye. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - CLOSEUP 
Through the viewer we see the identical view out of the window. 
JEFF (Over) Now take it away. 
The viewer moves away, and we are left with the identical scene, but not quite so still, a slight breeze stirring the foliage. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - MEDIUM SHOT 
Jeff looks up to a puzzled Lisa. 
JEFF Well? 
LISA It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all. 
JEFF I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed. 
STELLA You mean the one the dog was sniffing around? 
JEFF (To Stella) And digging in. (Points out window) Look at that flower bed. 
They all lean forward to look. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - MEDIUM SHOT 
The flower bed. The flowers have a slight dip in the center. Jeff speaks off: 
JEFF There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks? 
STELLA There's something buried there. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - MEDIUM SHOT 
All three ease back in awe. Lisa, still looking out, says: 
LISA (Breathing it) Mrs. Thorwald! 
Suddenly Stella begins to chuckle. They look around at her. Her face sobers as she answers their unasked question: 
STELLA You haven't spent much time in cemeteries, have you? (they don't answer) Mr. Thorwald could hardly put his wife into a plot of ground scarcely one foot square. 
Jeff and Lisa slowly turn their heads to look out at the garden. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The garden again with its small indentation of flowers over this we hear the ghoulish voice of Stella: 
STELLA Unless, he puts in standing on end -- which would be very original and not require the use of either a knife or a saw. My guess is she's scattered all over town. A leg in the East River -- an arm -- 
LISA (Cuts in) Stella, please. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - MEDIUM SHOT 
Jeff looks at Stella. 
JEFF Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again. 
LISA (Has a hard time saying it) It could be -- the knife, and the saw. 
STELLA (Quickly) Call Lieutenant Doyle! 
LISA No -- let's wait. Let's wait until it gets dark. I'll go over and dig it up! 
Halfway through Lisa's speech, Jeff begins speaking. 
JEFF (To Stella) I'm not going to call Doyle until I show him the body of Mrs. Thorwald -- (To Lisa) And you're not going to dig up anything, an get your neck broken too. 
THE CAMERA EASES BACK to allow Lisa to sit on the divan, and Jeff turn his chair toward her. Stella still look out the window, thinking. 
JEFF What we've got to do is find some way to get in there, and -- 
Stella's quiet voice brings him to a halt. 
JEFF Not as long as you tell me what you're looking at. 
She lifts it to her eye. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT 
Miss Lonely Hearts' apartment. She has opened a small brown bottle, and taken out four red capsules which she places on the white table cloth of her little table. 
There is a candle burning in a holder, and other lamps also light the apartment. She is dressed in sedate street clothes. She sits at the table, and by the light of the candle proceeds to open a black-covered book, and read it. The print is fine. She bends over it a moment, looks up at the capsules, and returns to the book. She seems quite at peace. Stella and Jeff are heard over: 
STELLA I wonder. 
JEFF What? 
STELLA Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules. 
JEFF You can tell that from here? 
STELLA I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter. 
JEFF Would four of them -- ? 
STELLA (Breaks in) No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible. 
JEFF (After a slight pause) Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
Stella lowers the long-focus lens. 
STELLA You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all. 
JEFF You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult. 
The door bursts open, and they both turn quickly toward the entrance. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
Lisa comes in, panting and flushed. She stands a second at the door, catching her breath, but smiling with the pleasure of sampling danger and escaping unharmed. 
LISA Wasn't that close? 
JEFF (Off) Too close. 
She comes down the stairs. 
LISA What was his reaction? I mean when he looked at the note? 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
As Lisa comes up to the two of them. 
STELLA Well, it wasn't the kind of expression that would get him a quick loan at the bank. 
Lisa comes close to Jeff, speaks warmly. 
LISA Jeff -- how did I do? 
He takes her hands. 
JEFF Real professional. Would have made a great layout for the Bazaar. The model pressed back against a brick wall, eyes wild, tense. Low cut bodice, in new suspicious black, with a -- 
Some of the pleasure goes out of her face. Stella notices it. 
STELLA (Interrupts Jeff) You'd make a good door prize at a wake. 
It relieves the slight friction, as both Jeff and Lisa laugh. Lisa happens to look toward the window, and the laugh dies. 
LISA Jeff -- the handbag. 
Jeff and Stella turn toward the window. Jeff grabs the long- focus lens, lifts it up. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT 
Thorwald has the new alligator bag belonging to his wife, in his hand. He moves slowly across the bedroom, out of sight behind the door. He doesn't appear in the living room. In a moment he reappears, moving back to his packing. He puts the handbag into one of the suitcases -- the one which he has almost completed filling. He goes on with his packing. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
Jeff puts down the long-focus lens, and turns around toward the room. The two women watch him expectantly. 
JEFF Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag. (Supporting his proposition) During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band. 
LISA (Excited) And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring! (To Stella) Do you ever leave yours at home? 
Stella lifts her left hand, and looks fondly at her ring finger. 
STELLA The only way anybody could get that off would be to chop my finger -- Let's go down and find out what's buried in the garden. 
LISA Why not? I always wanted to meet Mrs. Thorwald. 
Jeff looks at them aghast. 
JEFF What are you two talking about? 
STELLA Got a shovel? 
JEFF No. 
STELLA There's probably one in the basement. 
JEFF Now wait a minute -- 
LISA Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look. 
JEFF Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog -- 
Stella grows a little uneasy. Her eyes drift toward Thorwald's apartment. 
STELLA (To Lisa) You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there. 
JEFF There's no point in taking unnecessary chances. (He points) Give me the phone book, Lisa. 
Lisa moves for the phone book on the stand near the kitchen. 
Thorwald is displaying indignation and complaint to the police as he nods his head vigorously toward Lisa. At this the police start to advance into the apartment, going directly for Lisa. She flashes a quick look toward Jeff's window. She turns back as the first policeman reaches her. He starts to question her. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Stella turns away and goes quickly to the table for the binoculars. Jeff still is using the long-focus lens. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - BINOCULAR SHOT 
We see Lisa start to excuse her presence in the same manner she used with Thorwald previously, as if to say she came into the apartment by mistake. Thorwald, listening, comes quickly forward to contradict her, vigorously. He holds out the jewelry in his hand, and then picks up and shows the empty handbag. The policeman, impressed, looks back to Lisa for an explanation. She has none. Over this we hear Stella frantically asking: 
STELLA What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in? 
JEFF Smart girl. 
STELLA Smart? She'll be arrested! 
JEFF That'll get her out of there, won't it? 
The first policeman indicates that Lisa is to come along with him. He pauses momentarily to tell the second policeman to take a statement from Thorwald about the attempted burglary. The second policeman reaches for the jewelry in Thorwald's hand, and takes it for examination. In the brief pause while the two policemen speak to each other, Lisa starts to wave her left hand behind her back. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Jeff looking through his camera. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT 
We get a closer view of the waving hand. She stops waving and holds her fingers spread out. With her other hand she points to the wedding ring on her left hand. 
STELLA Mrs. Thorwald's ring! 
THE LENS PANS UPWARD AND ACROSS until it brings Thorwald's profile into the picture. He is looking down directly at Lisa's hands. His head slowly turns, and he looks right up -- directly into the lens. Suddenly he becomes aware that Lisa is signaling to someone who is watching him. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
Jeff and Stella. He drops the camera into his lap. 
JEFF Stella! The lights! He'd seen us! 
Stella hurries from the window, turning off lights, as Jeff backs his chair into the room. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
As Thorwald's attention is drawn back to the second policeman to answer further questions, the first policeman takes Lisa by the arm and leads her out of the apartment. He goes down the corridor pushing the curious people away from the door. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
The last light out, Stella stops to catch her breath, and turns to Jeff. 
STELLA When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this? 
JEFF (Urgently) Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there? 
STELLA (Squinting out window) Unless he's dumber than I think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up. 
Jeff points to a drawer in the wall cabinets. 
JEFF My billfold! In the right hand drawer. 
Stella moves to get it. 
STELLA What do you need money for? 
JEFF To bail Lisa out of jail. 
She finds a billfold, hands it to Jeff. He takes it, extracts some bills and begins counting them. As he counts, Stella comments: 
STELLA You know -- you could just leave her there until after next Tuesday -- so you could sneak away safely -- as planned. 
He looks up sharply at her, and then without comment goes back to counting the money. 
JEFF (With obvious disappointment) One hundred and twenty-seven. 
STELLA How much do you think you'll need? 
JEFF First offense burglary -- (He shrugs) -- probably two-fifty. (Gets an idea, points) The piggy bank. 
Stella, following his pointing finger, gets a piggy bank down from a shelf on the sideboard. He takes it, cracks it on the knee of his cast. It splits open, and some money comes out. Mostly bills, a few silver halves. 
What he doesn't get, Stella picks up. 
STELLA Ten here. 
JEFF Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough. 
STELLA I got twenty or so in my purse. Give me what you've got. 
Jeff does, as Stella gets her purse. 
JEFF What about the rest? 
STELLA When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute. 
Stella goes up to the door. The phone RINGS. Jeff grabs it, picks it up. Stella pauses. 
JEFF (To phone) Just a minute. (To Stella) I'll tell you who it is when you get back. 
Stella goes quickly out the door. He returns to the phone call, glancing at the same time toward the courtyard. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
JEFF Jefferies. 
DOYLE (Filter) This is Doyle, Jeff. 
JEFF (Urgently) Tom, I've got something real big for you. 
DOYLE (Wearily) Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be -- 
JEFF (Interrupting harshly) Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested. 
DOYLE (Slightest pause) Your Lisa? 
JEFF My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police. 
Jeff doesn't answer. 
THORWALD Say something! 
He moves forward a couple of steps. 
THORWALD (Sudden loud anger) Say something! Tell me what you want! 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Jeff still doesn't speak. He grips the flash holder a little more tightly, lifts it just the fraction of an inch as if he is prepared to use it. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Thorwald has advanced to the middle of the room, his eyes on Jeff and his hands clenching with the effort to control his anger. 
THORWALD Can you get me that ring back? 
JEFF (Quietly) No. 
THORWALD (Loud) Tell her to bring it back! 
He advances a step. 
JEFF I can't. The police have it by now. 
THORWALD Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh! 
Thorwald starts to move threateningly for Jeff. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
From a three-quarter angle toward Thorwald. Jeff lifts the flash holder to face level and closes his eyes. He explodes the flash. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP 
Thorwald's face fills the screen registering shock, confusion. He throws up his hands for protection and recoils, making an involuntary sound of surprise.

A vision of Jeff and the apartment as seen by Thorwald. 
It is distorted and out of focus, filled with large twisting balls of bright yellow color.

Thorwald blinking, trying to regain his sight. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP 
Jeff ejects the used bulb and quickly inserts another. 
He works furiously, sweating. He gets the bulb in the flash holder just in time to meet Thorwald coming at him. Jeff closes his eyes and another bulb explodes in Thorwald's face.

Thorwald stumbles back against the side table, knocking objects off onto the floor, struggling for balance and sight. Jeff works rapidly to put a fresh bulb in the holder. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT 
Thorwald regains his equilibrium and some of his sight. 
Orienting himself, he starts for Jeff again. This time, when the flash holder goes off, we see it from Jeff's angle. Thorwald is lighted almost white, shockingly outlining every detail of his face, clothes, hands. His rage and frustration are fixed for a brief but terrifying moment. He stumbles backward again, trying to brush the light away from his face almost as if it were a solid enveloping substance. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT 
Jeff ejects a bulb, puts his last bulb into the flash holder. He tries to move the wheelchair a little further away from Thorwald. Then he raises the flash holder again. 
In b.g. we see: Doyle, Lisa, Stella and the detectives come to Thorwald's door, try it. Locked. 
One of the men steps forward with a flat steel jimmy and snaps the lock open. They move quickly into the darkened apartment. Doyle hits the lights inside the kitchen. The group goes into the living room. The lights go on. No sign of Thorwald. Doyle, Lisa and Stella instinctively turn and look toward Jeff's apartment. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
From Thorwald's apartment shooting at Jeff's window. A sudden bright flash is seen as the last flash bulb goes off. And it lights the scene of Jeff in the wheelchair and Thorwald diving through the air at him. Darkness rushes in, blacker than before. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
Thorwald has finally reached Jeff, knocking the flash equipment out of his hands and coming to grips with him. 
It is apparent that he is trying to pull Jeff out of the wheelchair. Jeff fights him off. 
The wheelchair crashes over, spilling Jeff to the floor. 
Thorwald is on top of him, lifting, dragging him to the window. Jeff grabs everything he can to keep himself away from the window, but Thorwald is far too powerful for him. He strains to raise Jeff to the windowsill. 
THORWALD I'll give you a good look out the window. 
Slowly, inexorably, he raises Jeff to the windowsill. 
Jeff frantically grabs for the upright window frame, wrapping his arms around it. Thorwald shoves the rest of his body over the windowsill.

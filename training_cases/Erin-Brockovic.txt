ERIN BROCKOVICH A True Story 
by 
Susannah Grant 
February 1, 1998 
EXT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUBURB, MAIN DRAG - DAY 
Palms sway ... the sun washes everything in yellow ... cars motor down either side of the landscaped median ... the calls of mockingbirds mingle with the BLIP BLIP of car alarms. 
ON THE SIDEWALK, a SKATEBOARD CA-LUNKS down the sidewalk, past the foot traffic of Southern Californians: flip-flops, Doc Marten's, Rollerblades, Nikes ... then, in the middle of this pedestrian normalcy, a pair of IMPOSSIBLY HIGH SPIKE- HEELED PUMPS struts out of a shop.  So high it hurts to look at them.  As the shoes leave frame, we TILT UP and see they're leaving a 99-cent store. 
As the Pumps turn and head up the street, we see they are connected to a pair of IMPOSSIBLY LONG, SHAPELY LEGS. Eveready legs -- they just keep going and going. 
They saunter past two BUSINESSMEN on a lunch break.  The men pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful woman.  In fact, everyone this woman passes lets their eyes rest on her a microsecond longer than usual. 
- Two SKATEBOARDERS note the STRETCHY MICRO-MINI skimming the tops of her thighs. 
- A MAILMAN spots the BIG, DARK SUNGLASSES tucked into a MOUNTAIN OF BIG, BLOND HAIR. 
- A PRE-TEEN GIRL glimpses the PLUNGING NECKLINE of the TIGHT, BRIGHT RED MIDRIFF-BARING BUSTIER. 
It isn't until she rounds the corner at the end of the block that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone is so goggle-eyed.  Eye-catching is an understatement.  All those folks who say Barbie's proportions are unrealistic have obviously never met ERIN BROCKOVICH. 
EXT. AROUND THE CORNER - DAY 
A side street.  No pedestrians, just parked cars.  A PARKING TICKET flaps under the wiper of an old Hyundai. 
ERIN Fuck. 
Even when she talks dirty, there's a heartland goodness to her voice.  Like Kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze. 
As she grabs the ticket from the windshield, her sunglasses accidentally CLATTER to the ground. 
ERIN Shit. 
When she picks them up, a fingernail snags on the pavement. 
ERIN God damn it. 
She tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in. 
WIDER ON THE STREET 
The Hyundai starts it up, signals.  Then, just as it pulls slowly out into the street, a JAGUAR barrels around the corner, accelerating out of the turn, and rams into the side of Erin's car, sending it CAREENING into the median.  It SMASHES into a foot-thick lightpost.  And stops. 
EXT. MASRY & VITITOE - DAY 
A boring building on a boring block in the Valley, surrounded by strip malls.  Definitely not where the power lawyers work. 
ROSALIND (O.S.) Morning, Mr. Masry.  How you doing today? 
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY 
Generic.  Cottage cheese ceilings, motel art.  A sign over the reception desk reads: MASRY & VITITOE, ATTORNEYS AT LAW. 
ED MASRY, senior partner, slumps by ROSALIND, his chipper receptionist, with a cup of coffee in his hand.  He's in his mid-50's, compact and -- even though it's only 9 AM -- already rumpled. 
ED Don't ask that on Mondays, Rosalind. 
Whatever passion he once had for the personal injury law that is his career has long since dissipated.  He trundles off toward his office. 
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - DAY 
Ed's secretary BRENDA -- 50's, jaded, hates her job, but what can you do? -- is on the phone when Ed rounds the corner. She puts the call on hold, turns to Ed. 
BRENDA Tony Marvin. 
ED Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time? 
BRENDA His dry cleaners.  You want him? 
ED What do you think?  What's this? 
He grabs a gift-wrapped bottle off her desk, reads the card. 
BRENDA Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend. 
ED Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client. 
BRENDA He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there. 
Ed peers into his office.  It's a mess -- papers everywhere, unopened mail.  Standing in the middle of the room is Erin, in a teensy, leopard-print mini-dress.  As she jiggles a spike-heeled foot, everything about her shimmies gloriously. Except her head, which is held in place by a neck brace. 
ED Whoa. (to Brenda) Remind me. 
BRENDA Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says. (sarcastic) And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think? 
ED You shouldn't judge, Brenda. 
BRENDA Right.  Lap-dancers are people too. 
As Ed heads into his office, Brenda picks up the phone. 
BRENDA I can't find him, Tony.  We'll have to call you back. 
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY 
ERIN Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a million dollars.  You told me I'd be set. 
Ed notices her ranting is starting to draw attention. 
ED Okay -- let's try and settle down here. 
ERIN Settle down?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't afford to settle down! 
Beat. 
ED I'm sorry, Erin. 
ERIN Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my kids. 
Erin turns away from him and heads for the stairway. 
EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY 
A shitty little house in a shitty part of Northbridge.  The Hyundai with a bashed-in side pulls up to the curb. 
Erin gets out, takes the mail from her mailbox, then heads over to the equally grim house next door and rings the bell. 
A Hispanic woman in her 60's opens the door, holding a white baby.  This is MRS. MORALES. 
MRS. MORALES Hi, Erin!  You're back so soon.  How was it? 
She hands Erin the baby.  It's BETH, Erin's 9-month old. Erin avoids the question by focusing on her baby. 
ERIN Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie? 
MRS. MORALES Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good? 
The truth is too depressing to share. 
ERIN It'll be fine, yeah. 
MRS. MORALES Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries -- 
ERIN What? 
MRS. MORALES My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her. 
ERIN You're moving away?  When? 
MRS. MORALES Next week. 
ERIN (stunned) Wow, that's soon -- 
MRS. MORALES I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door. 
Oh, God.  In Erin's arms, Beth starts to COUGH. 
EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY 
Erin carries Beth up to her house.  As she nears her door, she steps on a GIANT WATER BUG.  It crunches under her sole. 
ERIN Ugh. 
Insult added to injury.  She heads up to the house, dragging her shoe, wiping off the bug guts. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN LIVING/DINING SPACE - DAY 
Just as dull inside.  Salvation Army furniture.  A lot of beige.  Erin's two older kids, MATTHEW (7) and KATIE (5) are at the table.  Beth is in a baby seat.  Erin spoons some Mac & Cheese onto their plates, trying to hide her worry. 
MATTHEW I don't like this part, it's all crusty. 
KATIE I like the crust. 
Erin switches the plates. 
ERIN Put your napkins in your laps and eat up. 
KATIE How come you're not eating? 
Cause there isn't enough food. 
ERIN Mamma's gonna eat later. 
From her baby seat on the table, Beth COUGHS some more. Thick, sick-sounding coughs.  Erin looks at her. 
ERIN Don't go getting sick on me, baby.  Okay? 
INT. ERIN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
The shower and sink are both on full, filling the room with STEAM.  Erin is seated with COUGHING, CRYING Beth on her lap, trying to steam the illness out of her. 
ERIN It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.  I promise. 
But her face doesn't look like she believes it. 
EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY 
Matt and Katie are messing around with a gumball machine. 
INT. DRUGSTORE, AISLE - DAY 
Erin is holding Beth, wandering the aisles.  She stops at the medicines, thinks for a long moment, then, hating herself, glances to make sure no one's looking, and picks up a bottle. 
INT. DRUGSTORE, AT THE REGISTER - DAY 
As a CUSTOMER steps away from the register, Erin steps up with the bottle in her hand and smiles at the CHECK-OUT LADY. 
Erin shakes her head, no.  Great, thinks Anna. 
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY 
As Anna shows Erin around the office, they pass JANE, the bitter office manager, and Brenda, at the coffee area. 
JANE Just last week, he told my sister we weren't hiring. 
BRENDA What's your sister look like? 
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Ed is packing up his office.  Erin sticks her head in. 
ERIN Mr. Masry? 
He turns, sees her. 
ED Yeah? 
ERIN I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend. 
ED Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays. 
ERIN Oh.  Okay.  That's okay. 
Ed looks at her a moment, sees that it's far from okay. 
ED Oh, for Christ's sake ... 
He takes out his wallet, looks in. 
ED All I have is hundreds. 
ERIN I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry. 
ED Bullshit, you don't. 
He slaps a hundred in her hand and leaves.  When he's gone, she looks at the bill -- her life raft -- and gives it a great big kiss. 
EXT. BABYSITTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Erin is at the door, taking Beth from the BABYSITTER, a shabby, unkempt-looking woman in her 40's.  Katie and Matt pull on their backpacks and troop out of the sitter's house. 
EXT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT 
Erin is leaving the store, carrying Beth in one arm and a bag of groceries in the other.  Katie and Matt are each carrying a bag of groceries as well.  They are all singing and moving with the jaunty step of the newly carefree.  Katie spots a flower display outside the store. 
KATIE Mommy, can I get a flower? 
ERIN Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
A small room with Salvation Army furniture.  A BUNCH OF DAISIES is propped in a Ragu jar on Katie's bedside table. Matt and Katie are asleep in bed.  Erin looks down at them, smiles, then kisses them good-night. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Erin comes out of the bedroom and softly closes the door. But just as the handle clicks into place, the house is filled with the DEAFENING ROAR of a MOTORCYCLE, REVVING and REVVING. It sounds as if it's gonna drive through the wall. 
EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Erin steps out onto her front stoop and looks over at what used to be Mrs. Morales's house.  A few MOTORCYCLES are parked on the lawn; A FEW BIKERS are drinking beer on the stoop; and one asshole is on his bike, REVVING HIS ENGINE. 
ERIN Hey! 
But of course he can't hear her.  She walks over to him, stands right in his line of vision. 
ERIN HEY! 
He sees her and kills the engine.  Everything about GEORGE HALABY is tough -- his denim, his leather, his bike, his long hair.  Everything but his eyes, which twinkle like Santa's. 
GEORGE Well, hello to you, darlin'. 
ERIN What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise? 
GEORGE Just introducing myself to the neighbors. 
ERIN Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up. 
The guys on the porch chuckle.  Erin turns and starts back to her house.  George hops off his bike and follows her. 
GEORGE Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours? 
ERIN Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine. 
GEORGE Now, don't be like that.  Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness? 
Erin shakes her head in disbelief and keeps walking. 
GEORGE Come on.  Gimme your number, I'll call you up proper and ask you out and everything. 
She stops at her porch, turns to him. 
ERIN You want my number? 
GEORGE I do. 
ERIN Which number do you want, George? 
GEORGE You got more than one? 
ERIN I'm not gonna leave my kids with you. 
GEORGE Why not? 
ERIN Cause I don't even know you. 
GEORGE Yeah, and whose fault is that? 
He's got a point there.  After a beat: 
GEORGE What, you got so many friends in this world, you don't have use for one more? 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
George is on the floor with Matt and Katie, playing War. Katie points to the Harley emblem on his leather jacket. 
KATIE What's that stand for? 
GEORGE That's for Harley Davidson.  The best damn motorcycle ever made. 
Erin comes in from the kitchen. 
ERIN And if I catch either of you anywhere near one, I'll knock you silly.  Go on to bed, now -- I'll come tuck you in in a minute. 
They get up ... 
GEORGE Night. 
KATIE/MATT Night. 
... and head into bed.  George starts cleaning up the cards. 
GEORGE Great kids. 
Erin bends down to help him. 
ERIN Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them. 
GEORGE How? 
ERIN I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat. 
GEORGE I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons. 
ERIN Great.  Another deadbeat. 
GEORGE I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to. 
ERIN Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund? 
GEORGE I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap. 
ERIN (with a little laugh) I hope that's not supposed to impress me. 
GEORGE Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you? 
ERIN It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice. 
GEORGE Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it. 
ERIN Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids? 
GEORGE Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them. 
ERIN Right. 
She starts cleaning up the cards. 
GEORGE I do.  I like how they keep it all simple, you know?  They don't get all complicated about life, like grown-ups do.  A bicycle and an ice cream cone -- boom, done, they're happy. 
Erin thinks about the offer. 
ERIN You're around every afternoon? 
GEORGE Yup.  Usually working on my bike. (she's tempted) No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady. 
Tempting.  Erin looks him over. 
ERIN This isn't gonna get you laid, you know. 
GEORGE (with a laugh) Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we? 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The wee hours.  Erin's in a t-shirt, sitting on her mattress on the floor.  The paperwork from the box is now spread all over the floor around her.  She's reading a letter. 
CLOSE ON THE LETTER 
It's from PG&E, to Donna and Peter Irving.  We see the phrases, "purchase your house ...", "fair market value ..." 
CLOSE ON ANOTHER DOCUMENT 
It's a list of comparable house sales in the area.  Owner, cost; owner, cost.  Every house is in the $65,000 range. 
From another room, she hears the sound of BETH CRYING.  Still reading the file, Erin gets up and goes into: 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, BETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Still reading, Erin gets Beth out of her crib.  Beth quiets. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
EXT. HINKLEY, CA - DAY 
This is a dry, desolate part of California.  No downtown, no community.  Just tract after tract of arid farmland, with small, bland, unprotected ranch home cropping up out of the landscape like occasional tombstones. 
A beat-up old sign on the road reads: "HINKLEY, CA.  POP: " but the  corner where the number would be has broken off. 
As a gust of wind lifts dust from the fields, Erin turns onto Community Boulevard, the main road that cuts through Hinkley. 
INT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - DAY 
Erin looks around.  The house she's passing has been razed. A heap of lumber and wires in the middle of the property. 
As she checks the piece of paper with Donna's address, she drives by the PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION, a massive gray structure of pipes, chimneys and ladders, set way back from the road.  Erin passes it without noticing it. 
She stops at an intersection.  The house on the corner has been boarded up with plywood.  Erin notices it -- depressing -- then turns the corner onto Donna's street. 
EXT. DONNA IRVING'S HOUSE - DAY 
A generic ranch home standing all alone in the middle of nothing.  There's a pool out back and a chain link fence hugging the property.  No landscaping.  Dull, but clean.  A few BOTTLES OF SPRING WATER wait by the door. 
The Hyundai pulls into the driveway and stops.  Erin gets out.  As she heads up to the door, her spike heels sink into the dirt.  She rings the bell.  It has a melody chime. 
DONNA IRVING opens the door.  She's 35, petite, with a scrappy, high-strung manner.  She's wearing tight jeans, and her dark curls are piled on top of her head. 
ERIN Hi.  Donna Irving? 
DONNA Yes? 
ERIN I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe? 
DONNA (a little surprised) You're a lawyer? 
ERIN Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for them.  You got a minute? 
INT. THE IRVINGS' HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY 
The house is furnished with little money, but lots of care. Erin's on a plaid couch, in a sea of needlepoint pillows. Out back, two GIRLS, ages 9 and 11, are playing in a pool. 
ERIN This is a real nice place you got here. 
DONNA (O.S.) Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it. 
She comes out from the kitchen with a tray of iced tea. 
DONNA I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ... 
ERIN Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey. 
Donna corrects the positioning on a couple of pillows. 
DONNA Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over. 
ERIN Right. 
DONNA Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have. 
ERIN Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me -- 
This would be the perfect opportunity for many to get self- pitying.  But not Donna.  Life's handed her a shitload of lemons, and darned if she hasn't made a shitload of lemonade. 
DONNA I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer -- 
ERIN Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that. 
DONNA Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you. 
ERIN I'll say.  Holy moley. 
DONNA So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point. 
ERIN Yeah, I can see that. (beat) I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff? 
Donna tops off their iced teas. 
DONNA Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place. 
ERIN Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place. 
DONNA Well, they paid for the doctor's visit. 
ERIN They did? 
DONNA You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill. 
ERIN Wow.  Why would they do that? 
DONNA Cause of the chromium. 
ERIN The what? 
DONNA The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off. 
INT. IRVING HOUSE, GARAGE - DAY 
CLOSE ON A BOX, with "CHROM INFO" scrawled on it. 
DONNA (O.S.) PG&E came around a few years ago, told us they put chromium in our well by mistake. And since we shouldn't have to drink it if we don't want to, they gave us free spring water and offered to buy our house. 
WIDEN to see Donna pulling the box down into the room. 
ERIN What's chromium? 
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - DAY 
As Erin heads for the door, pleased glances fly from secretary to secretary.  Erin reaches the door, but can't open it with the box in her arms.  She turns to the room. 
ERIN I don't suppose any one of you cunts could open the fucking door for me. 
EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY 
Erin's Hyundai rumbles to a stop in front of the house.  Erin shoves open the creaky, reluctant door, lifts her box of stuff off the seat, and gets out. 
As she walks around the car and toward the house, she runs into the MAILMAN.  He hands her a packet of mail. 
MAILMAN Here ya go, Miz Brockovich. 
Erin looks at the top of the stack.  It's the electric bill. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - DAY 
Erin enters, puts down the box and stares at the mail. Bills, bills, and more bills.  As she throws them on the table, she sees George coming out of the kitchen. 
ERIN What are you doing here? 
GEORGE Fixing a leak under your sink. 
She heads into the kitchen, weary and irritated. 
ERIN I didn't ask you to do that.  Damn it, George, I don't ask you to do things like that. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
Erin enters, sees all the cleaning stuff from under the sink is spread around the kitchen floor.  A tool box lies open. 
ERIN Great. 
GEORGE I'm gonna clean it up. 
Erin gets down on her knees and starts putting things away. 
GEORGE Relax, Erin, I'll do it -- I'm not -- 
Before he can finish, a huge WATER BUG runs onto Erin's hand. 
ERIN Ugh -- Jesus -- 
She jumps and brushes it off. 
GEORGE Yeah -- you had a whole family of those things hanging out back there. 
She takes off her shoe and smacks at the bug, missing it. 
ERIN Damn it -- 
The bug skitters away from her, along the floorboard.  Erin chases it, smacking at it repeatedly, missing it every time. 
GEORGE Don't worry about it, I'll get it later. 
But Erin keeps after it, corralling all her frustrations into killing that one bug. 
ERIN Come here, you little motherfucker -- 
The bug crawls up onto the table, zipping behind the salt, the pepper, the napkin holder.  Erin keeps after it, BANGING the table harder and harder with each SMACK of her shoe. 
GEORGE Hey, whoa -- relax -- 
The salt and pepper skid off the table.  The napkins fly from their holder.  Just as Erin's about to nail the bug, it slips into a crack in the wall and disappears.  Erin hurls her shoe at the crack.  It SMASHES into the wall. 
ERIN GOD DAMN IT! 
As Erin stands there staring at the wall, her breath starts to come heavily -- those deep breaths that precede tears. She slowly slides down into a chair, defeat overcoming her. 
ERIN (almost a whisper) ... God damn it. 
She looks around at her for-shit kitchen and starts to cry. 
ERIN What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats? 
GEORGE It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator. 
ERIN I can't call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my phone. (beat) I got fired. 
GEORGE What?  But you been working so hard -- 
ERIN Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of difference. (then, fragile) Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so nothing? 
George picks a napkin up off the floor, hands it to her. 
GEORGE You're not nothing, Erin. 
ERIN Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen. (wipes her nose) I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone. 
GEORGE You are someone. 
ERIN No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not. 
GEORGE You're someone to me. (beat) You're someone real special to me. 
He takes a step toward her and kneels in front of her, very close.  He takes her shoe from her hand and puts it back on her foot.  Then he takes her hands in his and kisses them. 
ERIN I'm no good, George.  I make people miserable. 
But he kisses her anyway.  And for the first time in so long, she feels like something other than a failure.  He pulls her into him, and she lets herself be pulled. 
ED This is the only thing you found? 
ERIN So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more. 
ED Find out. 
EXT. 10 FREEWAY - DAY 
Erin's Hyundai zips along the freeway.  "Funky Town" is blaring from the tinny stereo.  Over it: 
MATTHEW (O.S.) I hate this music. 
INT. HYUNDAI - DAY 
Erin's driving.  Matthew's in the front seat.  Katie and Beth (in a car seat) are in the back. 
ERIN There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible. 
MATTHEW Well I hate it. 
KATIE I hate it too.  I hate this trip. 
ERIN Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before. 
KATIE I'm gonna hate it. 
MATTHEW Me too. 
She glances at them, frowns a little. 
ERIN You know what I'm realizing for the first time?  You kids are a couple of downers.  I mean, you are the real thing -- a couple of honest-to-God depresso-types. (small smile) Who in the heck raised you, anyway?  Some kind of moron? 
Katie smiles a little.  She likes this side of her mom. 
KATIE Yeah.  A real moron. 
ERIN Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet. 
MATTHEW (also smiling) Yeah. 
ERIN Thank God we got you away from her, huh? 
By now they're all smiling.  Funky Town plays on. 
EXT. PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION - DAY 
The Hyundai is parked at the entrance to the station, by a row of dead trees.  Erin is standing beside a sign that says "Private Property.  No Trespassing", taking pictures of the massive structure in the distance.  Matthew, Katie, and Beth are drawing in the dirt with sticks. 
ERIN Stay out of the road.  I'll be right back. 
She wanders up the drive, onto PG&E property, moving around the plant, taking pictures of it from every possible angle. 
As she wanders over a big, flat, dry field to the side of the plant, she glances over her shoulder to check on her kids and notices the trail she made in the dirt has a greenish hue. She looks at the dirt right her feet.  Kicks the ground. 
Below the surface, the dirt turns from brown to green.  Erin notes this, then looks back at her kids playing in the dirt. Worry comes over her face.  She heads back to them. 
EXT. HINKLEY MART - DAY 
The kids are waiting at the car.  Erin comes out of the store with a bottle of water and uses it to rinse off their hands. 
EXT. WATER BOARD - DAY 
The sound of a BABY CRYING.  The Hyundai's parked in front. 
MATTHEW (O.S.) I'm hungry. 
INT. WATER BOARD - DAY 
Erin is at the Xerox machine, copying a file while she tries to calm Beth.  There's a stack of files on the nearby table. Matthew and Katie are flopping around on the floor. 
ERIN We'll go eat in a minute.  Settle down. 
Whining, fussing.  Ross goes over to her. 
ROSS You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner. 
ERIN Ross -- you are an absolute angel. 
She hands Ross the STACK OF DOCUMENTS. 
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - DAY 
Ed comes in in the morning, and without pausing, hands Brenda a copy of the STACK OF DOCUMENTS, with a Post-it on the top. 
ED Fax these to this number, okay? 
BRENDA All of 'em? 
ED All of them. 
He continues into his office and closes the door. 
CLOSE ON THE FAX MACHINE LED 
Brenda types in the number.  The recipient's I.D. comes up on the LED: PG&E CLAIMS DEPT. 
INT. IRVING HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Another copy of those DOCUMENTS, now in Donna's hands.  She's on her couch with Erin, reading them.  Outside, Donna's two daughters are playing in the pool.  She reads the last page and looks up at Erin, bewildered. 
DONNA An on-site monitoring well?  That means -- 
ERIN -- breast cysts, uterine cancer, Hodgkin's disease, immune deficiencies, asthma, chronic nosebleeds. 
Despite their persuasiveness, Baum parrots what is obviously the party line: 
BAUM A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair. 
ED Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here. 
BAUM 250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer. 
Ed looks across at this pissant little kid. 
ED (to himself) Jesus Christ. (he stands, to leave) I will present your offer to my clients.  I doubt they'll accept it. 
As Ed starts out: 
BAUM Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation. 
ED (containing his anger) Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind. 
And Ed leaves the conference room.  Erin follows him out. 
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY 
Erin follows Ed as he stomps back to his office. 
ERIN At least they made an offer. 
ED That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you. 
ERIN I don't get why they'd do that. 
ED Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world. 
ERIN And you can't? 
ED What, you think I'm made of money? 
Behind them, Baum steps out of the conference room. 
BAUM Hey, you know where I can get a cab?  My plane leaves Burbank in forty-five minutes. 
Ed turns and looks at him.  He gets a tiny smile. 
ED Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport. 
BAUM Hey, excellent.  Thanks. 
Baum heads out to the reception area. 
ERIN Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours. 
ED (gleeful) Yeah.  Isn't that a shame? 
She watches him go into his office, impressed.  Big smile. 
ERIN Well I'll be God damned. 
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
End of the day.  Most everyone has left.  Erin is at her new work space near Ed's office.  She's poring over a fat file of documents.  ROSALIND wanders by with her coat on. 
ROSALIND You've been reading for hours. 
ERIN I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god". 
ROSALIND Hey, just so long as you see Him. 
Rosalind turns on Erin's desk lamp and heads out. 
Outside the big glass office doors, Rosalind stops to talk to a lost-looking COUPLE IN THEIR MID-30's.  These are MANDY and TOM BROWN.  He's a security guard uniform, with an envelope under his arm.  Rosalind points to Erin.  The Browns enter the office and approach her. 
MANDY Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich? 
ERIN Yeah.  Who are you? 
TOM I'm Tom Brown.  This is my wife Mandy.  We used to live across the street from the Irvings.  PG&E bought our house last year. 
INT. ERIN'S DESK - LATER 
CLOSE ON photos of chickens, each with a twisted, limp neck. 
TOM It's called wry neck.  It's when they're born without any muscles in the neck. 
WIDEN to see Erin looking at them with Tom and Mandy. 
ERIN Wow.  How many were born like this? 
TOM Twelve, maybe thirteen. 
MANDY When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too. 
ERIN It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot. 
She tucks them into a file, as if that's it. 
MANDY There's something else, too. 
ERIN What? 
TOM Well.  Mandy here's had nine miscarriages. 
ERIN I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward? 
ED Erin -- 
Erin's enjoying Ed's discomfort almost too much to stop.  But just almost.  She shifts gears. 
ERIN Then I asked him how much he makes if I didn't get anything. 
They look at Ed.  Well? 
ED Then I don't get anything either. 
ERIN And I realized, he's taking a chance too. 
When they hear this, and realize he's in it with them, they all reach for their pens and sign.   They hand the agreements over to Erin, who takes them across the room to Ed.  He stuffs them in his briefcase and closes it up.  That's that. 
ED All right, then.  Let's hit the road. 
Boy.  Cold as ice.  Erin stares at him, stunned by his brusque manner, then leans in to him, close. 
ERIN (whispering) Mr. Masry, if you don't mind my saying, you got a lot to learn about being friendly. These people just hired you as their lawyer. The least you could do is make a little pleasant conversation. 
She gives him a stern look, then turns toward the women. 
ERIN Donna, let me help you clean all this up. 
She picks up a tray of iced tea and cookies and heads to the kitchen.  Donna and Mandy follow, leaving Ed alone with Pete and Roy.  He stands there, awkwardly.  Then, finally: 
ED So, what's, uh ... what's new? 
INT. DONNA'S KITCHEN - DAY 
Erin and Donna are putting away the cleaned glasses.  Mandy is scanning the chromium pamphlet Erin gave her. 
MANDY You know that thing it says in here about rashes? 
ERIN Uh-huh? 
MANDY Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other.  I just figured it was something in the genes.  And you know how it is -- you don't like to ask about things like that ... 
Erin listens, interested. 
EXT. LINWOOD DAIRY, BARN - DAY 
Another day.  BOB LINWOOD, 40's and gruff, is in the barn, tossing hay around. 
ERIN (O.S.) Excuse me.  Are you Mr. Linwood? 
He sees Erin picking her way toward him in her high-heels. 
LINWOOD Yeah? 
ERIN I'm Erin Brockovich.  I work at the law firm that represents your former neighbors the Browns.  They suggested I give you a call. 
She steps in a cow patty.  Laughs at herself good-naturedly. 
ERIN Boy howdy, did I ever wear the wrong shoes. 
EXT. THE DESOTOS' HOUSE - DAY 
CLOSE ON A SIGN that reads: THE DESOTOS, hanging on the side of a small, paint-chipped house.  Erin is at the door talking to MARY DESOTO, 65, who's wearing a big cross at her breast. 
ERIN ... and Mr. Linwood seemed to think that your husband had been sick as well. 
MARY Yes, Mr. DeSoto has lung cancer.  Never smoked a day in his life, neither. 
INT. LAURA AND MIKE AMBROSINO'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Erin is talking to MIKE and LAURA AMBROSINO -- 30's.  Solid, family folks.  But Laura's left brow and cheekbone look swollen and misshapen, and she's trying to hide the fact that she's in a lot of pain. 
ERIN Mrs. DeSoto said she wasn't sure exactly what it was that you had -- 
PETE She's not alone on that one. 
LAURA Well, they know what it is -- it's called fibrous dysplasia -- 
PETE The bones start growing again.  Gives her headaches like you wouldn't believe. 
LAURA -- they just don't know what caused it. 
INT. RITA AND TED DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY 
Erin is talking to TED AND RITA DANIELS.  Their daughter ANNABELLE, 10, is sitting on the couch, wrapped in a blanket. 
ERIN ... then Mike Ambrosino remembered seeing you folks at the hospital from time to time too, so I thought I'd just stop by. (to Annabelle) You must be Annabelle. 
ANNABELLE Uh-huh. 
ERIN Whew, are you ever a beauty.  I mean, you must drive those boys crazy. 
Annabelle smiles a little. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Late night.  George rolls over -- Erin's side of the bed is empty.  He checks the clock, then gets up and heads into: 
INT. ERIN'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - NIGHT 
He peers around and spots her, sitting in the little kid's chair in Matthew and Katie's room. 
Erin is holding Beth, watching Matt and Katie sleep.  Erin hears the floor creak as George steps into the doorway. 
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S DESKS - NIGHT 
It's dark.  The door to Erin's area opens. 
ERIN And here, ta-daa, is my desk. 
She flicks on the lights.  Brenda's desk is decorated and as a present on it.  Erin's is empty. 
GEORGE Which one? (it's obvious) Maybe they didn't think you were coming. 
Erin shakes her head.  She's surprised by how hurt she is. 
ERIN (quietly) God damn.  I work so hard.  The least they could do ... 
George looks over at her, sees her eyes glisten a little.  He goes over to her, wraps his arms around her. 
GEORGE Hey.  Fuck 'em, babe.  Who needs 'em, huh? 
He kisses her.  She leans into him.  He kisses her some more. 
GEORGE (quietly) See?  All we need is each other. 
She kisses back.  She's gonna let him take care of her.  Some more kisses, heating up.  He slides her onto her empty desk. 
GEORGE Good thing there isn't a present there, huh? That mighta hurt. 
She laughs a little.  He slides his hands up her skirt.  She pulls him into her, tugging his shirt out of his pants. 
INT. MASRY OFFICES, HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Ed is coming down the hall with his wife, JOEY.  Joey is much younger than Ed, and very pretty. 
ED I'll show you what we did back here -- 
INT. ERIN'S DESK - NIGHT 
Erin and George, in a rapidly-heating-up clinch on her desk, hear the voices.  Erin pulls away. 
ERIN That's Ed. 
GEORGE Lock the door. 
ERIN No, I wanna say hi. 
He pulls her back into him, not wanting to move. 
GEORGE We'll say hi later.  Lock it. 
But Erin pulls away ... 
ERIN Come on, George, it's a party. 
He watches her straighten her dress and take a step away from him.  It's just one step, but it feels a hell a lot farther. 
INT. RECEPTION AREA - LATER 
Erin and Ed are at the reception desk, talking and laughing. 
NEARBY, Joey and George are standing together, awkwardly. 
JOEY Your wife's real pretty. 
GEORGE She's not my wife. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Matthew lies awake in his bed, listening to George and Erin fight. 
GEORGE (O.S.) It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while -- 
ERIN (O.S.) What do you want to talk about instead? Your day?  That's a fascinating subject. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Erin and George are fighting while they get ready for bed. 
GEORGE Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am -- 
ERIN That is not what I'm -- 
GEORGE Bullshit, Erin.  Bullshit. 
The fight is interrupted by the sound of BETH CRYING. 
ERIN Great.  Excellent.  Thank you very much. 
She leaves the room. 
INT. BETH'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Beth is wailing in her crib.  Erin comes in in her nightshirt and lifts Beth out.  Then, more to herself than to Beth: 
ERIN It's okay, baby.  It'll be okay. 
She runs her hand over Beth's head, then slides down the wall and crumples onto the floor.  As she curls around Beth, Erin starts to COUGH.  Deep, raspy coughs from way down low. 
EXT. PG&E STATION - NIGHT 
Late, late at night.  The plant is silent.  The property seems empty, until we notice Pete Irving standing alone inside the gates, staring up at the station. 
After a beat, he picks up a rock and hurls it at the plant. It misses.  Not that it would do anything if it hit.  He reaches for another, throws it.  Then another, and another. He hurls rock after rock at the gigantic plant.  Then, overwhelmed by his impotence, he lets out a TERRIFYING YELL. 
EXT. HINKLEY GAS STATION - SUNSET 
Erin is sitting out front, swigging cough syrup from the bottle.  She checks her watch: 6:30.  The GAS STATION ATTENDANT comes out, locks up, and turns out the lights. 
ERIN This is the only station in town, right? 
ATTENDANT Yup. 
He gets in his car and drives off.  Erin sits down again. Looks down the road in both directions.  Nothing. 
Then she spots, behind some bushes across the street, a glint of chrome.  She shields her eyes against the sunset and sees: the BEAT-UP TRUCK parked behind some shrubbery. 
Erin looks around, realizes she's alone.  As she looks back at the truck, the ASH of a cigarette brightens in the cab. She realizes she's being watched.  The driver's door opens. 
Erin bolts for her car, scrambling to find her keys.  She jumps in, locks her doors, and tries to start her car, but it won't turn over.  Panic.  The Man in the Dark Glasses has gotten out and is heading toward her car. Erin looks around again.  Not a soul.  She tries the engine again.  And again. 
Just as he gets to her car, the engine engages.  Erin peels out of the gas station. 
INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT 
Erin drives down the road, hyperventilating, trying to focus on the road.  She looks in the rear-view mirror -- nothing. 
She reaches the train tracks.  A train is passing.  She has to stop.  As she's waiting, the glint of headlights bounce off her rear view mirror.  Truck lights, coming her way. Fuck.  She looks at the train -- still passing -- then back at the headlights closing in on her.  The train, the headlights, the train, the headlights ... 
Finally, when the headlights are right behind her, the last train car zips by.  Erin peels out, bounding her rickety car over the tracks.  The truck follows. 
EXT. HINKLEY ROAD - NIGHT 
The Hyundai zips down the road.  And behind it, the truck. 
INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT 
She looks out at the landscape around her.  It's black.  No other cars on the road.  She starts to panic, accelerates. 
EXT. HINKLEY ROAD - NIGHT 
The Hyundai going faster.  The truck still following. 
INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT 
Erin comes up on a stop sign.  She runs it.  So does the truck.   A little later, she makes a turn and sees THE LOST CAUSE SALOON.  In the parking lot, like a lifeboat, sits Ed's Mercedes.  She pulls into the drive and jumps out of her car. 
INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT 
Ed is eating ribs when Erin bursts through the door.  She rushes over to him, near tears with fear and exhaustion. 
ERIN Someone's following me. 
ED What?  Who? 
ERIN Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer. 
Ed gets up and heads toward the door. 
ED (to the counter guy) Beer, please. 
As Ed looks out the door, Erin collapses onto a bench. 
ED What kind of truck? 
ERIN I don't know.  Big.  Dark. 
ED He's gone. (back to the table) Did you get a license plate?  Or a make? 
ERIN No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things -- 
ED I was just asking.  Are you all right? 
ERIN Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine. 
Ed looks at her.  She looks terrible.  Shaky, tired, drawn. 
ED Jesus, you look like shit.  When was the last time you had a decent night's sleep? 
EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT 
Crappy and pink.  Ed's Mercedes pulls into the parking lot. Erin's Hyundai follows.  Ed stops, gets out. 
INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT 
Ed swings by Erin's open car window. 
ED Don't worry.  I'm getting two rooms. 
EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT 
Erin and Ed amble down the porch, checking door numbers, each rattling a key.  They find their adjacent rooms and stop. Erin leans against the wall, too weak to stand. 
ED Lock the door every which way you can.  And if there's anything -- funny sound, whatever -- pound on the wall.  I'll come right over. 
She nods a little.  Then before she goes into her room: 
ERIN I think you should know -- there's very few people in the world who don't piss me off 90 percent of the time. (beat) You're one of 'em. 
It's as tender as she gets, and he's moved by it.  They look at each other.  Maybe even considering.  But after a long beat, she reaches for her door again.  Moment over. 
ED I'm triple locking my door, so don't even think of trying to take advantage. 
She smiles, goes inside.  He watches her close her door behind her before going inside himself. 
EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT STOOP - NIGHT 
ERIN What? 
JANE I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night. 
ERIN (seething) Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights? 
JANE You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something. 
Erin glares at her ... 
ERIN I don't believe this -- 
... then turns and storms out of Jane's office. 
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY 
Ed is on the phone when Erin barges in, rage in her eyes. 
ERIN I want my fucking money -- 
ED (into phone) I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here -- (puts the call on hold, then, to Erin) Do you mind? 
ERIN (seething) Yeah, I mind.  You bet your ass I mind. 
Clearly, she's in a dander he's going to have to deal with. 
ED Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or -- 
ERIN It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me. 
ED Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with -- 
ERIN Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had? 
ED Is that what you want? 
ERIN I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day. 
Ed sighs.  Realizes he's going to have to take this on. 
ED I'll see what I can do. 
ERIN You might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake. 
She storms out. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Erin is standing at the sink, visibly exhausted, trying to do the dinner dishes with one arm and comfort Beth, who's CRYING, with the other.  Matthew comes in. 
MATTHEW Can I play roller hockey? 
ERIN We'll see. 
MATTHEW When? 
The DOORBELL RINGS.  Erin goes to get it.  Matthew follows 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 
Matthew is dogging Erin on this.  Beth is still crying. 
MATTHEW Randy's mom said yes right away. 
ERIN (snapping) Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house. 
Erin opens the door.  A MESSENGER is there. 
MESSENGER Erin Brockovich? 
ERIN Yeah? 
MESSENGER Package from Masry & Vititoe. 
He hands her a manila envelope.  She signs for the package, then tears into it as the Messenger heads away. 
A CHECK and a SET OF KEYS fall out.  She looks at the check. It's made out for $5,000.  A note attached reads "HIRE A NANNY. AND LOOK OUTSIDE. - E." 
Erin looks up and sees A BRAND-NEW CHEVY BLAZER parked on the curb.  She looks at the keys in her hand.  Chevy keys.  Whoa. 
EXT. MASRY & VITITOE, PARKING LOT - DAY 
Erin drives up in the Blazer, pulls into a parking space. 
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, LAW LIBRARY - DAY 
It's dark.  Ed's seated at a table, alone.  Erin walks by the door, then spots him and stops in the doorway. 
ERIN Believe it or not, I would've been satisfied with just the check. 
Ed turns, sees her. 
ED Well, you go threatening to leave, I can't take any chances.  You're the only person around who understands what I'm doing. Things come up, I gotta know I got someone to turn to. 
She sits, reading him. 
ERIN What kind of things come up? 
ED Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer. (beat) 20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it. 
ERIN Whoa.  No shit. 
THERESA You know what?  Why don't I take Erin down the hall, so we can start in on this stuff? 
Erin notices all her files in stacks against the wall. 
ERIN Hey -- those are my files -- 
THERESA Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research. 
Okay, these people are starting to piss her off. 
ERIN Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research. 
THERESA No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask. 
ERIN Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will. 
THERESA Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them. 
ERIN Whose number do you need? 
THERESA Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs. 
ERIN I said, whose number do you need? 
THERESA You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart. 
Erin just stares at her.  Theresa sighs, reluctantly glances down at a file. 
THERESA Annabelle Daniels. 
ERIN Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346. 
As Theresa starts to write it down: 
ERIN 10 years old, 11 in May.  Lived on the plume since birth.  Wanted to be a synchronized swimmer, so she spent every minute she could in the PG&E pool.  She had a tumor in her brain stem detected last November, had an operation on Thanksgiving, shrunk it with radiation after that.  Her parents are Rita and Ted.  Ted's got Chron's disease, and Rita has chronic headaches and nausea and underwent a hysterectomy last fall.  Ted grew up in Hinkley.  His brother Robbie and his wife May and their five kids Robbie, Jr., Martha, Ed, Rose, and Peter lived on the plume too.  Their number's 454-9445. You want their diseases? 
Beat.  Erin glares at Theresa, indignant. 
THERESA Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here -- 
ERIN That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes. 
INT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
It's still raining.  Erin is following Ed to the car.  He's furious. 
ERIN She insulted me! 
ED Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect -- 
ERIN Why the fuck should I respect her? 
Ed stops in his tracks, furious.  He glares at her. 
ED Because that's how people treat each other! 
ERIN Not in my world. 
ED Gee, I wonder why. 
On that, he gets in his car, slams the door, and drives off, leaving her standing alone in the pouring rain. 
ERIN Hey!  You're my ride! 
INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, HALLWAY - DAY 
Potter and Ed are walking down the hallway, mid-conversation. A FEW PARALEGALS follow them with files. 
POTTER I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what -- 
ED Right. 
POTTER I think we should makes some changes. 
EXT. LINWOOD'S DAIRY - DAY 
Bob Linwood is in his barn, mucking it out.  Theresa is at the edge of the property, trying unsuccessfully to get his attention by yelling and waving her arms.  In her expensive shoes, she's stopped short of the cow patty minefield. 
INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
CLOSE ON A CLIENT FILE as a hand fills in a phone number. 
WIDEN TO SEE Erin seated with a PARALEGAL, rattling off facts and numbers from memory.  She's seized by a COUGHING FIT. 
EXT. LINWOOD DAIRY - DAY 
Theresa still hasn't gotten Linwood's attention.  Finally, rather than ruin her shoes, she picks up a stone and tosses it at the barn.  It hits the window and BREAKS IT. 
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S DESKS - DAY 
Erin's desk is empty: no Erin, no files, nothing.  Ed comes out of his office and hands Brenda a STACK OF DOCUMENTS. 
CLOSE ON THE FAX LED 
Brenda types in the number.  The recipient's I.D. comes up again, only this time it says: POTTER, HUGHES, ROSEWOOD. 
INT. POTTER, HUGHES, ROSEWOOD, HALLWAY - ANOTHER DAY 
A SECRETARY carries the documents to Potter's office.  On the way, she passes THE CONFERENCE ROOM.  Inside, Erin is still dictating to the PARALEGAL.  She's shivery with fever now. The floor around her is littered with tissues. 
INT. DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY 
ED You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun -- 
ERIN "Fun?"  Jesus, "fun?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?" 
ED Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't -- 
ERIN Not personal?  That's my work in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is. 
She starts to COUGH and CRUMBLE, but fights it. 
ERIN (weakened) How dare you take that away from me. 
ED No one's taking anything -- 
ERIN Bullshit.  You stuck me in Siberia dictating to some God damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me.  After all I've done for you, that's the thanks I get. 
By now the entire office is watching.  As are the lawyers in the conference room. 
ED Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ... 
ERIN Perks?  Jesus -- perks? 
Erin reaches into her bag, pulls out her cel phone. 
ERIN If this piece of shit is supposed to take the place of your respect, you can take it and shove it up your ass. 
She throws it at him and storms away.  The phone hits the glass wall of the conference room, CRACKING it.  Ed just stands there, with the lawyers staring at him through the splintered glass wall. 
EXT. MASRY & VITITOE PARKING LOT - DAY 
Erin gets to her car.  As she opens the door, the ALARM SOUNDS.  She fumbles with her keychain, trying to turn it off, but she's too sick and upset to figure it out.  With the siren still blaring, she kicks at the car in rage. 
INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT 
Erin's driving home.  As she turns onto her street, her headlights wash across the sidewalk and illuminate a small boy, wearing a backpack, walking the other way. 
ERIN Holy shit -- 
She looks over her shoulder, but the sidewalk is too dark. She pulls a U-turn in the middle of the street.  A CAR HONKS. 
Erin scans the sidewalk, finally sees him again.  Holy shit, is right.  It's Matthew, wandering the streets at night. 
ERIN Matthew -- 
She pulls ahead of Matthew and bumps up onto the sidewalk, blocking his path.  When he sees her car, he turns and runs the other way.  Erin leaps out and follows him. 
ERIN Matthew!  MATTHEW! 
She catches up and collars him. 
ERIN God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here? 
MATTHEW I'm gonna go live with George. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
MUSIC is playing.  TANIA is on the phone.  The receiver is yanked from her hand.  She turns to see Erin hovering over her, barely containing herself. 
ERIN If you leave here real fast, I might not kill you. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATTHEW AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Matthew's in his bed, facing the wall.  Erin sitting on the foot of his bed, near tears.  Katie's watching from her bed. 
ERIN We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise. 
MATTHEW You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised. 
ERIN I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short. 
MATTHEW You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more. 
ERIN Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on Earth I love more than you.  Nothing. (beat) I promise. 
She lays her hand on his shoulder, but he shrugs it off and inches away from her. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Erin comes out of the bedroom.  As she turns to close the door, she collapses to the floor in a heap.  Out cold. 
INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT 
A busy Southland ER.  George bursts through the doors with Katie, Matthew and Beth in tow.  He goes up to the desk. 
GEORGE I'm looking for Erin Brockovich.  They brought her in in an ambulance? 
INT. ER WAITING AREA - DAY 
The kids are waiting.  George is talking to a DOCTOR. 
GEORGE Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis? 
DOCTOR It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain. 
GEORGE Jesus. 
DOCTOR She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now. 
GEORGE How does someone get meningitis? 
DOCTOR Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ... 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Erin's sitting up now, jiggling her knee, unable to sit still.  She checks her watch again.  6:30.  She can't take it.  She throws off the blanket and gets up. 
ERIN Come on, kids, we're going for a ride. 
INT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON HANDS.  As people stream in, they are each handed a release form with a space for a signature on the bottom. 
INT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - LATER 
It's sweltering.  The room, packed with plaintiffs, hums with horse flies and tension.  People are fanning themselves with the release forms.  Potter's addressing them from a raised platform.  Ed, Theresa, and Andrew are seated behind him. 
POTTER Binding arbitration isn't all that different from a trial.  It's overseen by a judge. Evidence is presented in much the same way. 
EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT 
One more car pulls into the lot.  It's Erin's Chevy. 
INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT 
Erin unbuckles her seat belt. 
ERIN Stay in the car, babies, I won't be long. 
EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT 
Erin gets out of the car, looks around, then goes over to a window and looks in at the packed meeting. 
PLAINTIFF (O.S.) And then a jury decides? 
POTTER (O.S.) No, sorry, I should have mentioned that. There's no jury in binding arbitration.  No jury, and no appeal. 
She climbs up on an old wagon for a better view. 
BOB LINWOOD (O.S.) No appeal?  So what are our options if we don't like the result? 
POTTER (O.S.) Well -- you have none.  The judge's decision is final.  But I really don't anticipate that as a problem. 
INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT 
Now, in addition to the stifling heat, the large room is thick with mistrust.  People are shifting in their seats, whispering to each other. 
TOM BROWN You don't even know what it's gonna be; how do you know we're gonna like it? 
Agreeing MURMURS ripple through the crowd. 
POTTER As I said before, it will definitely be somewhere between 50 and 400 million dollars. 
MANDY BROWN Which?  There's a big difference there. 
POTTER I wouldn't want to speculate at this point. 
MANDY BROWN Ed -- what do you think it'll be? 
Potter turns around and looks at Ed seated behind him. 
ED I think ... Kurt's right.  We shouldn't speculate. 
MANDY BROWN So then, what, that mystery number's divided up at the whim of some judge -- 
POTTER Judges don't make decisions based on whim, ma'am.  They make them based on precedent and evidence. 
The GRUMBLE of discontent has overtaken the room.  More whispering, more movement. 
EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT 
Erin watches the meeting fall apart.  It's driving her crazy. 
ERIN Fucking idiot -- 
INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT 
Potter sees he's losing them, too.  Tries to gain control. 
POTTER Look.  Everyone.  Is this a big decision? Absolutely.  But I do believe that if you put a little faith in the system, you'll be quite pleased with the outcome. 
Ted Daniels gets up from his seat. 
TED DANIELS Mr. Potter, if you knew me from Adam, you'd know that being pleased isn't an option for me anymore.  Now don't take this personally, sir, but I've never seen you before in my life.  I'm not about to put my faith in anything just cause you tell me to. 
He drops his agreement form, unsigned, then takes Rita's hand and heads for the door. 
EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT 
Meeting's over.  The plaintiffs stream out of the firehouse. Cars start up, headlights flick on.  People pull away. 
INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT 
Everyone has left.  Erin enters and looks around.  The floor is littered with rejected, unsigned release forms. 
She thinks for a moment, then gets an idea.  She picks up a release form, and leaves the firehouse. 
EXT. MINI MALL - NIGHT 
Everything's closed, except the KINKO'S store at the far end. Erin's truck pulls into the parking lot. 
INT. KINKO'S - NIGHT 
A BORED EMPLOYEE is at the register, painting with Wite-Out on a blue piece of paper.  Erin enters, dragging her kids. 
DONNA For what? 
ERIN Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns now.  I was thinking -- Mandy really values your opinion ... 
INT. MANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Erin, Donna, Mandy, and Tom are seated on the sofas.  Mandy signs an agreement.  Hands the pen to Tom, who also signs. 
EXT. LINWOODS' HOUSE - DAY 
From outside, we see Erin at the kitchen table with Donna and Bob and Ruth Linwood, who are listening intently. 
INT. DESOTOS' HOUSE - DAY 
Erin and Donna are leaving, saying good-bye to Mary DeSoto. Erin has a signed release form in her hand. 
INT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S CAR - DAY 
DISCO blares.  The two boxes.  The formerly empty one now has a small stack of signed release forms in it.  The top one has Bob Linwood's signature. 
IN THE FRONT SEAT 
Erin is driving, eating a hamburger, and going over her list of plaintiffs. 
EXT. HINKLEY MART - EVENING 
People are going about their shopping.  Rita Daniels is stopped, talking with A FEW MORE PLAINTIFFS. 
RITA I thought so, too, but Erin says a trial's gonna take years 
INT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - NIGHT 
The signed stack has grown; the unsigned stack has shrunk. Erin drops five more agreements into the "signed" box. 
INT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
In the wee hours.  While her kids sleep, Erin sits at the cheap motel room table, going through her forms, organizing, alphabetizing. 
INT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY 
CLOSE ON ERIN, fast asleep at the table, her face pressed against the linoleum.  There's some NOISE in the room, WHISPERING.  Erin stirs and looks around to see George behind her, diapering Beth, while Matt and Katie put their shoes on. 
ERIN What time is it? 
GEORGE Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast. 
Erin forces herself awake. 
ERIN No, I need my car -- 
GEORGE We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep. 
He picks up Beth, takes Katie's hand, and calls across the room to Matthew. 
GEORGE C'mon, pal.  Leave that alone, we gotta go. 
Erin turns to see Matthew holding one of her release forms. 
ERIN Oh, baby, please don't play with that, okay? I got 'em all organized.  Just put it back. 
But he's reading it.  And something has caught his attention. He looks up at Erin. 
MATTHEW This girl's the same age as me. 
Erin gently takes the form away from Matthew, wanting to shield him from the harsh realities of this case. 
ERIN That's right, sweetheart. 
She replaces the form on top of the stack. 
MATTHEW She's one of the sick people? 
ERIN Yeah.  She is. (beat) But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better. 
Matthew mulls this over a bit more. 
MATTHEW How come her own mom isn't helping her? 
ERIN Cause her own mom's real sick, too. 
Matthew thinks real hard about this, then heads over to the door, where George, Beth, and Katie are waiting for him. Before he leaves, though, he turns back to Erin. 
MATTHEW Maybe we'll bring you back some breakfast. You want eggs? 
She looks at the group of them, feels their shift toward acceptance.  Smiles, moved. 
ERIN Eggs'd be great, baby.  Eggs'd be perfect. 
INT. ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY 
Erin's driving along a dusty Hinkley road, eating cold eggs out of a take-out container with her fingers. 
EXT. FIREHOUSE - DAY 
Morning.  A GROUP OF MEN are arriving at work.  Erin's truck pulls up.  She grabs some release forms from the truck and wanders up to the men. 
ERIN Hey, y'all.  How you all doing today? 
INT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY 
She tosses eight more agreements in the signed stack. 
ROSALIND In the conference -- 
But Erin's spotted them and headed off before Rosalind can finish.  Anna, Brenda and Jane notice the purpose in her gait.  They watch her with interest. 
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
The table is covered with boxes of documents: the anticipated slew of paper that PG&E is sending them.  Ed, Kurt, Theresa, Andrew and ABOUT FIVE PARALEGALS are sifting through them. 
Erin breezes in like sunshine. 
ERIN Morning! 
ED Erin?  What are you -- 
ERIN (ignoring Ed) You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight.  So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you. 
She plunks the box down on the table.  Potter opens the top of the box.  Looks in. 
ERIN 635.  They all signed.  Every single one. 
IN THE DOORWAY, Anna, Brenda and Jane appear, wondering what's up.  A huge smile of appreciation slowly spreads across Ed's face. 
ED Ho - ly - shit. 
ERIN Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too. 
Erin hands Ed a manila envelope.  He opens it. 
ERIN Internal PG&E documents, all about the contamination.  The one I like best says, and I'm paraphrasing here, but it says yes, the water's poisonous, but it'd be better for all involved if this matter wasn't discussed with the neighbors.  It's to the Hinkley station, from PG&E Headquarters. Stamped received, March, 1966. 
Potter and Theresa reel.  Ed shakes his head in disbelief. 
POTTER Where did -- how did you do this? 
ERIN Well, what with me not having any brains or legal expertise, I just went on up there and performed sexual favors.  635 blow jobs in five days.  Whew, am I ever tired. 
And she struts out of the room, leaving everyone slack-jawed. The CLIP CLIP CLIP of her heels carry her away. 
EXT. MASRY & VITITOE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY 
Erin comes out of the office, flushed with success, and heads down the hall.  She presses the elevator button.  The doors open.  As she steps on, Ed comes out of the office. 
ED Hey! 
Erin puts her hand in the door, keeping it from closing.  He stares at her, in awe. 
ED I don't know what to say. 
ERIN Say you were wrong. 
ED I was wrong. 
ERIN Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself. 
ED I did.  Both. 
ERIN Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this. 
ED The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in history. 
He looks down the hall at her, standing so tall and proud in the elevator.  He walks toward her, stops right outside the elevator. 
ED But I know you're not gonna quit on me. 
ERIN How do you know that? 
ED (with a smile) Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing.  Give him another chance. 
Of course she will.  She releases her hand so he won't see her smiling.  Ed watches the doors close. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. PCH - DAY 
One of those days when the bay sparkles like a glitter ball. 
Erin's Chevy moves up the PCH.  DISCO music emanates from it. 
INT. ERIN'S CHEVY - DAY 
Erin's at the wheel.  Time has passed -- her hair's a little different.  She's singing along with "Funky Town." 
EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - DAY 
Erin gets out of her new truck, looks, sees the Irvings in a little cluster.  Donna's under an umbrella.  Pete is slathering on sunscreen.  The two girls zip out toward the water.  Erin waves.  Pete and Donna spot her, wave back. 
EXT. BEACH - LATER 
Donna is standing at the edge of the water, watching her girls boogie board in.  Erin comes up behind her. 
ERIN How you feeling today? 
Donna turns, sees her.  Smiles. 
DONNA It's a good day.  I feel good. 
ERIN Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop. 
Erin sits down on a rock. 
ERIN The judge came up with a number.

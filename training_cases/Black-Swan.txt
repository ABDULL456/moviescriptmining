Her eyes are drawn to a NEW GIRL standing in the doorway. Nina pauses to scrutinize her. She wears vampy make-up, hair down. Dark and sexy. 
NEW GIRL Soloists? 
Wary, the girls mumble mmm-hmm's and nod. 
NEW GIRL (CONT'D) Great. 
She slinks past the suspicious group of girls and plops down at an open spot. 
NEW GIRL (CONT'D) Fucking got off the wrong stop and had to hoof it from 79th. 
Nina exchanges glances with the other girls, taken aback. 
The new girl notices the looks, smirks to herself and starts getting ready. 
9 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 9 
Nina wears a look of intense concentration as the entire company warms up, including the pubescent CORPS MEMBERS and a handful of MALE DANCERS. 
LEGS, HANDS, and FEET repeat the same movements all around her, led by a severe BALLET MISTRESS. 
BALLET MISTRESS To the back, fondu, to the back, plie. Fourth, fourth, and one and fifth, to the back... (to a corps member) Like this. Push it. Why can't you do this? 
Using the mirror, Nina monitors her movements carefully. The mistress surprises her. 
BALLET MISTRESS (CONT'D) It needs to be looser. Relax. Let it flow. 
Flustered, Nina nods and tries to follow her instruction. 
Suddenly, the girls around Nina begin stripping off their sweatshirts and insulated pants. 
Nina sees that the intense and brooding director of the company, THOMAS LEROY, has entered the space. He has the unkept look of an artist. Magnetic and intense. 
The ballerinas remove their warm-up gear to show off their bodies. 
Leroy walks around the room, judging his flock. Smiles and glances are thrown his way. 
He goes up to the ballet mistress, takes her hand and kisses her on the cheek. Even she manages a smile. 
He heads to the line of soloists, studying them. 
LEROY We all know the story: virginal girl, pure and sweet, trapped in the body of a swan. She desires freedom, but only true love can break the spell. 
He taps a dancer on the shoulder, she lights up. He walks, then taps another. A selection process of some kind. 
Nina looks nervous, has an inkling of what it means. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Her wish is granted in the form of a prince. 
He nears Nina. She sneaks peeks at him, eager and hopeful. He acknowledges her with a small nod and a smile. 
But he walks on without tapping her. She deflates. 
LEROY (CONT'D) But before he can declare his love, her lustful twin, the Black Swan, tricks and seduces him. 
He approaches the New Girl. Nina watches, threatened. 
But he doesn't tap her either. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Devastated, the White Swan leaps off a cliff, killing herself. But, in death, finds freedom. 
He taps one more soloist and then CLAPS. 
The music stops and all the girls face him, attentive. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Good morning, company. 
They respond "Good morning" in nervous, unsure voices. 
LEROY (CONT'D) We open our season with Swan Lake. Done to death, I know. But not like this. We strip it down. Make it visceral and real. 
He pauses for effect. 
LEROY (CONT'D) And a new production needs a new Swan Queen. A fresh face to present to the world. 
Surprised, the soloists glance at each other, trying to keep their cool. 
LEROY (CONT'D) But which of you can embody both swans? The white and the black? 
Nina prepares for disappointment. 
LEROY (CONT'D) All the soloists I touched... Please go to your scheduled rehearsals this afternoon. 
The girls are confused. 
LEROY (CONT'D) And the girls I didn't touch, meet me in studio B at five. 
Nina breathes, realizing the girls he didn't tap are the ones he's selected, purposefully toying with them. 
The New Girl obliviously marches into the room, listening to an iPod. 
LEROY (CONT'D) (SARCASTIC) Good of you to join us. 
The New Girl notices everyone staring and pulls out her earphones to talk. 
NEW GIRL Sorry. 
LEROY Girls, this is Lily. Straight off the plane from San Francisco. She's filling Rebecca's old spot. 
LILY gives a small wave. Nina eyes her with scorn as she catches her breath. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Go on, get warmed up. 
LILY I'm good. 
Lily starts stripping off her layers, revealing her lithe body. On her back, she has a TATTOO OF LILIES. 
NINA Should I go again? 
LEROY (distracted by Lily) I've seen enough. Thank you, Nina. 
She looks down, getting his meaning. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Okay, Veronica. Your turn. The White Swan's variation... 
Furious, Nina marches out of the room. 
A13 INT. THEATER BATHROOM STALL - NIGHT A13 
Nina stands up from a kneeled position and flushes the toilet. She wipes her mouth with the back of her hand and exits the stall. 
13 OMITTED 13 11A. 
14 OMITTED 14 
15 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 15 
Nina walks along a quiet side street. She clutches her jacket, for warmth and comfort. 
Her CELL PHONE starts ringing. She digs it out of her bag and checks the CALLER ID: MOM. She silences it and puts it away. 
Up ahead, she sees the sidewalk dead end at a construction site, and detour into an enclosed PASSAGEWAY beneath the scaffolding. 
Nina slows, a little scared, but decides to push on. 
The passageway is dark. The temporary lighting dim and flickering. 
She walks quickly, trying to get to the other side. 
She hears the sound of soft FOOTSTEPS approaching. She stops, and the other FOOTSTEPS stop. 
She looks up and sees the faint outline of a SLENDER WOMAN standing there, almost ghostlike. 
Nina starts walking again, keeping her head down, and the other woman continues as well. 
As they pass each other, Nina glances at the woman's face and discovers... 
The woman looks EXACTLY LIKE HER. 
But the moment passes as the woman continues walking. 
Nina stares after her, perturbed. 
Her cell phone starts RINGING again, piercing the silence. Nina continues out, ignoring the phone. 
16 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 16 
Nina enters and locks the deadbolt and chain-lock behind her. 
She turns and is startled to see Erica standing right there. 
ERICA How did it go? 
Nina looks at her confused. Erica helps take off her coat. 
ERICA (CONT'D) You were late, so I called Susie in the office. An audition?! Can't believe he just sprung that on you. 
Nina nods. 
ERICA (CONT'D) So? 
NINA It went okay. 
ERICA Just okay? 
Erica hangs up her coat, turns and sees Nina tearing up. 
ERICA (CONT'D) Darling? 
Nina waits anxiously outside Leroy's office. 
She hears someone approach, looks up and sees Leroy coming down the hall. 
She puts on a nervous smile. He doesn't reciprocate. 
LEROY Yes, Nina? 
NINA Do you have a minute? 
He doesn't answer, just opens the door to the office and walks in. 
She takes a breath and then follows. 
23 INT. LEROY'S OFFICE - SAME 23 
Nina closes the door and faces the cozy, dark space. Large couch, posters from the ballet on the wall--several featuring Beth. 
Leroy lights a cigarette, quietly studying her and not making this easy. He takes a drag, and exhales. 
NINA If now's not a good time... 
LEROY Now's fine, what is it? 
NINA I just wanted to tell you, I practiced the coda last night, and I did it. 
LEROY How thrilling for you. 
NINA (THROWN) Well... 
LEROY Okay, Nina, listen, I honestly don't care about your technique, you should know that by now. 
NINA Yes, but- 
LEROY Anyway, I've already chosen Veronica, so... 
He lifts his hands in the air, "there you go." 
NINA (DEVASTATED) I see. 
She makes a move towards the door. 
LEROY You're not going to try and change my mind? 
She looks back at him, uncertain. 
Leroy nonchalantly stubs out his cigarette. 
LEROY (CONT'D) You must have thought it was possible, coming to find me like this. 
He pauses, looks her up and down as if trying to decipher her. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Why are you here? All dolled up? 
NINA (UNSURE) I came to ask you to give me the part. 
LEROY That all? 
She doesn't know what he means. He comes around his desk and approaches her. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Truth is, when I look at you, all I see is the White Swan. Yes, you're beautiful, fragile, fearful. Ideal casting. But the Black Swan...it's a hard fucking job to dance both. 
NINA I can be the Black Swan too. 
LEROY Really? She's hungry, volatile. In four years, every time you dance, I see you obsess over getting each move exactly right, but I never see you lose yourself. 
Insecure, she looks like she wants to run out of the room. 
LEROY (CONT'D) All that discipline, for what? 
NINA I want to be perfect. 
He laughs. 
LEROY Perfection's not just about control. It's also about letting go. Surprising the audience. Surprising yourself. Transcendence. 
He considers her for a moment. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Very few have it in them. 
NINA I- 18A. 
Without warning, he slowly plants a kiss on her mouth. 
It lasts for a moment, but he suddenly jerks away. 
LEROY Ow! Fuck! 
He touches his lip, stunned. 
She wipes the tears off with the back of her hand and pulls herself together. She comes out of the stall... 
Horrified to discover "WHORE" written on the mirror in RED LIPSTICK. 
Nina looks around the bathroom, to make sure she's alone. 
She snags a paper towel and wipes off the insult, smearing the mirror with red streaks. 
27 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 27 
Nina unlocks the door to the apartment. 
NINA Mom? 
Nina looks around, puzzled she isn't there. 
28 INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATER 28 
Nina opens the door and pokes her head in. 
But Erica's not in there either. Nina glances at the walls. 
Where several homemade PAINTINGS hang, all of the same subject: Nina as a young girl, posing in a tutu. On a desk, the ORIGINAL PHOTOGRAPH is clipped to a painting in progress. 
Out of the corner of her eye, one of the portraits seems to shift. Nina turns towards it, but the painting's now perfectly still. 
Unsettled, Nina withdraws. 
29 INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 29 
Post-shower, Nina's fuzzy reflection stares back in a steam covered mirror. 
Nina takes her hand and wipes a streak across, to see herself more clearly. 
She looks nervous. The enormity of what's in front of her setting in. 
She turns side-to-side, scrutinizing her body. She lifts her arm and pinches the skin to check her weight. 
She notices a small cluster of RED BUMPS on her shoulder. A small RASH. 
She feels the bumps with her fingers, bothered. 
She checks the same place on her other shoulder. 
There's no rash, just faint streaks of SCAR TISSUE. 
Nina slides the hamper in front of the door to block it. 
In the mirror now, one of the bumps is scratched and bleeding. 
Nina quickly wipes the blood off with her finger. 
The sound of the front door opening steals her attention. 
30 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 30 
Nina exits the bathroom wearing a robe. 
In the kitchen, she sees a CAKE with a lit SPARKLER sitting on the table. Her mother smiles anxiously. 
ERICA My daughter, the Swan Queen. 
She opens her arms and Nina falls into a hug. 
She looks at the cake. It has a ballerina sketched with frosting. Nina hides her disdain. 
NINA Oh, mom. 
ERICA It's our favorite, vanilla with strawberry filling. 
Erica picks up a knife and slices into the cake. 
NINA Just a little piece. 
Erica ignores her and starts cutting a very large piece. 
NINA (CONT'D) That's way too much. 
ERICA It's a celebration. 
NINA My stomach's still in knots. 
ERICA (OFFENDED) Fine then. 
Erica grabs the whole cake and heads towards the trash. 
NINA (GUILTY) Mom, don't. I'm sorry. 
Erica hesitates, but returns. She sets the cake back down. 
SUSIE Those are for you. From Mr. Leroy. 
NINA Beautiful. 
Susie leaves. 
Nina pulls a card out from the flowers and reads. A faint smile curls her lips. 
She opens her shoulder bag and removes a SMALL SATCHEL. She pulls out a pair of DIAMOND STUD EARRINGS and puts them on. 
35 INT. PATRON OF THE ARTS APARTMENT - NIGHT 35 
Leroy pulls Nina through a fundraiser gala, filled with rich looking PATRONS and some DANCERS from the company. 
Bewildered, Nina takes in her high-society surroundings, getting the occasional curious glance as she passes. 
Leroy grabs a couple CHAMPAGNE glasses off a WAITER'S tray. He hands a glass to Nina with a smile. 
He leads her up a staircase to a landing that overlooks the party. 
LEROY Ready to be thrown to the wolves? We need their cash, so smile. 
She smiles, as instructed. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. 
The crowd turns their gaze towards them. All eyes on her. 
LEROY (CONT'D) As I stand here tonight, I see so many familiar faces. Your contribution to the art we all cherish profoundly goes straight to my heart and I am very grateful. 
Polite applause. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Let me begin with a very important announcement. You all have had the chance to be enchanted, transported, sometimes devastated by the performances of this true artist of our company. She has been an exceptional inspiration to my work, a role model to our dancers and a deeply satisfying presence on our stage. You all know who I am talking about...Beth Macintyre 
More applause. Nervous, Nina unconsciously picks at her cuticles. 
LEROY (CONT'D) As we all know, every great career comes to an end. Beth is retiring at the end of the season. She will be giving her farewell performance as Melpomene, the role she originated in my first ballet. 
People start whispering, stunned by the news. Nina sees Beth in the crowd, giving a sad smile to the surrounding guests. Trying to remain dignified. 
LEROY (CONT'D) She will be greatly missed, but she will always be remembered. My little princess. 
Amidst the mummering, Nina sees Beth quietly sneak out of the crowd and out the front door. Leroy quickly covers. 
LEROY (CONT'D) But as we bid adieu to one star, we welcome another! 
He looks at Nina. She stops picking her nails, self- conscious. 
LEROY (CONT'D) As you know, we open our season with my new version of Swan Lake. Taking the role of our new Swan Queen is the exquisite Ms. Nina Sayers. 
Restrained APPLAUSE. 
Nina steps forward and curtseys. Someone seems to GIGGLE at her. Insecure, Nina glances towards the source and sees Lily flirting with a RICH GENT, uninterested in the official proceedings. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Soon you will have the pleasure of seeing her perform, tonight we raise a glass. To all of you, to Nina, to Beth, to beauty! 
He downs his drink and the crowd follows suit. 
36 INT. LIVING ROOM, PATRON OF THE ARTS APARTMENT - LATER 36 
PARTY GUESTS surround Nina and Leroy, trying to meet the company's newest star. Nina basks in all the attention. 
LEROY Dr. Brinson and his lovely wife, Ellen, tonight's sponsors. 
She shakes DR. BRINSON'S hand and curtseys to MRS. BRINSON. 
NINA Such a beautiful event. 
MRS. BRINSON Not as beautiful as you, dear. 
Nina demurs. They're replaced by another HUSBAND and WIFE. 
LEROY And this is Mr. and Mrs. Stein. 
Nina repeats the pleasantries, this time noticing that one of her cuticles is bleeding. She awkwardly pulls her hand away. 
Leroy leans in and whispers in her ear. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Relax, you're doing great. 
CUT TO: 
37 INT. BATHROOM - LATER 37 
Nina washes her hands. She looks at herself in the mirror and takes a deep breath. 
Someone KNOCKS on the door. 
NINA Just a second. 
NINA NO- 
Erica yanks her out of the room. 
41 INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 41 
Nina sits on the toilet, stripped to her underwear. She does her best to cover herself. 
Erica finishes dabbing her back with HYDROGEN PEROXIDE and replaces the cap on the bottle. 
She pulls out NAIL CLIPPERS and cuts Nina's nails down to their base. Each CLICK makes Nina twitch. 
ERICA I thought you'd outgrown this disgusting habit.(click) You haven't done it for years. (click) 
NINA Mom, please. 
Erica grabs Nina's other hand. 
ERICA It's the role, isn't it? All this pressure... I was worried it'd be too much. 
Nina stares at her, seething. 
42 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - LATER 42 
Nina crawls into bed, avoiding her mother's eyes. 
ERICA Don't be mad at me. You know I love you, you know I want what's best. But we have to take care of you. 
Nina doesn't respond. 
Erica opens the JEWELRY BOX and the tinny music begins playing. 
She hums and starts to stroke Nina's hair. 
Nina tries to brush her hand away. 
But Erica brings it back and keeps stroking. 
43 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 43 
Nina lies wide awake after a restless night. 
She slowly reaches down under the covers, down between her legs, to complete Leroy's "homework assignment." 
She closes her eyes and starts to maneuver. 
She suddenly hears a RUSTLING sound and a short SNORE. 
She freezes and opens her eyes. She slowly sits up in bed and sees Erica SLEEPING on a chair in the corner of the room. 
Nina glares at her. 
44 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 44 
Nina waits her turn as a row of DANCERS perform grand jetes diagonally across the room. 
She watches Veronica perform her leaps. She rejoins the group, giving Nina a nasty stare. 
Nina avoids it, looking towards Lily, who gives her a small smile. 
Just as Nina's turn arrives, a panicked YOUNG CORPS DANCER rushes in and makes a beeline for the severe ballet mistress. 
Nina takes one leap and then stops dancing, sensing something's wrong. 
The corps dancer whispers into the ballet mistress' ear. A look of shock on the mistress' face. 
The dancer collapses into the older woman's arms. 
The piano music trickles to a halt. 
Nina exchanges glances with some of the other dancers. 
First a few, then more dancers approach the two women, wanting to find out what's happened. 
Nina hangs back, filled with a sinking feeling. 
45 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER FOUNTAIN - DAY 45 
Nina sits as Leroy, worse for the wear, stares at the jets of water. 
NINA What happened? 
LEROY She walked into the street, got hit by a car. 
NINA Oh my god... 
LEROY I'm sure she did it on purpose. 
NINA How do you know? 
She tests it. Holds pretty well. 
She hears a creek. FOOTSTEPS approach. She removes the wood and sticks it inside her dresser, not ready just yet. 
She quickly lies down on her bed and waits to be tucked in. 
The door SQUEAKS open, and Nina looks towards it. 42A. 
48A INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 48A 
Nina, David, and the dancer playing ROTHBART rehearse the Black Swan and Prince Siegfried's Pas De Deux from Act 3. 
David lifts her, then sets her down, and they lean-in towards each other, almost kissing. 
LEROY No, no, not so stiff. Don't be scared of him. 
She pulls away from David, not at all coyly. Leroy exhales, frustrated. 
48B INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - ANOTHER DAY 48B 
Nina and David dance the next part of the section, looking more worn out. 
LEROY Forget about control. I want to see passion. 
She still looks tense, not getting it. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Let it out! 
48C INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - ANOTHER DAY 48C 
Nina practices with an OLDER BALLET MISTRESS. She demonstrates a movement, and Nina mimics her. The mistress scrutinizes, unimpressed. 
A49 INT. PHYSICAL THERAPIST'S OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY A49 
Nina is worked over by a PHYSICAL THERAPIST. Every joint and muscle aches, but Nina breathes through the pain. 
49A INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - YET ANOTHER DAY 49A 
Nina and David finish the section, completely soaked with sweat. 
They look at Leroy, heaving breaths. 
LEROY David, answer me this question: are you interested in fucking her? 
David snickers, embarrassed, shakes his head. 
LEROY (CONT'D) No, of course not. No one would be. 
Leroy comes face to face with her. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Nina, your Black Swan still looks no different than your White Swan. She's's just as...frigid. 
49B Suddenly, the lights turn off, throwing them into total 49B darkness. 43-46A. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Fuck! 
Leroy angrily marches to the door and whips it open. 
LEROY (CONT'D) (to someone in hall) Hey! We're still working in here. Lights back on. 
There's a momentary pause, and then the lights return. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Thank you! (to David, Piano Player) Okay, you guys can go. Thank you for your patience. (TO NINA) You stay. 
David gives her an insinuating glance, then shakes his head. Very used to Leroy's "methods." 
DAVID Have fun. 
David and the Piano Player leave them alone. 
49C Leroy approaches Nina and takes her hands in his. 49C 
LEROY I'll be the Prince. 
Made nervous by his touch, she nods. 
He walks behind her and puts his hands on her waist. 
He starts humming the score. And then they begin. 
They do a series of lifts and spins, Leroy bracing her. 
He lets go, she moves away from him. 
LEROY Use each finger, your face, your tits, everything. Entice me! 
He grabs her wrist. She spins. He lets go. He grabs her other wrist, she spins to face him. 
They get very close. 
Lily smirks with a realization. 
LILY Someone's hot for teacher. 
Nina gives her a withering glance. 
LILY (CONT'D) It's okay. I don't blame you. 
Nina stands up. 
NINA I should go. It's getting late. 
LILY Hey, I was only playing. 
Nina walks towards the door. 
LILY (CONT'D) Nina? 
She ignores Lily and exits. 
51 OMITTED 51 
52A INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 52A 
Nina lies in the bath, eyes closed, concentrating. 
Her body jostles slightly, moving her hand between her legs, seeking release. 
Growing frustrated, she moves more and more aggressively. 
She abruptly stops and submerges herself under the water, defeated. 
She lies still, her arms wrapped around her chest. 
She opens her eyes, her vision distorted by the water. 
Suddenly, her blurred Double appears, staring down at her. 
Nina shoots up. 
The Double is gone. 
Nina scans the bathroom, but she is alone. 
Nina notices some water dropping off her fingers, onto the lip of the tub. 
Then a few drops of RED land on the white porcelain. 
Worried, she examines her fingernails, which have started to grow back. She discovers blood and bits of skin. 
52B LATER 52B 
Out of the tub, Nina checks herself in the mirror. Her shoulder is streaked with deep SCRATCHES. 
She grabs a pair of little SCISSORS from the medicine cabinet and starts trimming her fingernails. 
She looks up at the mirror and sees her reflection snip off the tip of her index finger. 
Nina GASPS and drops the scissors, CLANGING in the sink. Two of her fingers are bleeding, their tips sliced. 
ERICA (O.S.) (CONCERNED) Nina? 
Nina looks at the door, already blocked by the hamper. 
NINA I'll be out in a second. 
She stays still, hoping she won't try to come in. 
Footsteps recede and Nina breathes. 
She runs her hands under some water to clean off the blood. 
53 OMITTED 53 
54 OMITTED 54 
55 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 55 
David and Nina dance the Black Swan's Pas de Deux. Once again, Nina's rigid and self-conscious. 
LEROY Try it again. 
They resume dancing. She finishes, out of breath, and looks at Leroy and the Russian ballet mistress. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Again. 
The piano music starts up again, and she begins dancing. 
When she finishes, she looks at him, eager for feedback. 
Nina stands and goes to the other end of the car. He continues singing, undeterred. 
58 OMITTED 58 
59 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 59 
Nina sits on the floor in a loose sweatshirt, sewing ribbon onto pointe shoes. 
Erica sits across from her, sewing ribbon onto another pair. 
ERICA Has he tried anything with you? 
Nina doesn't respond. 
ERICA (CONT'D) He has a reputation... 
Nina tries to ignore her. 
ERICA (CONT'D) I have a right to be concerned, Nina. You've been staying late so many nights. "Rehearsing." I hope he's not taking advantage, that's all. 
NINA He's not. 
ERICA Good. I don't want you making the same mistake I did. 
NINA (INSULTED) Thanks. 
ERICA Not like that. I just mean as far as my career was concerned. 
NINA What career? 
ERICA The one I gave up to have you. 
NINA You were 28. 
ERICA So? 
NINA And only... 
Nina bites her tongue. 
ERICA Only what? 
NINA Nothing. 
ERICA What? 
NINA (DEFIANT) Nothing. 
Erica glares at her. 
ERICA How's your skin? 
NINA It's fine. 
ERICA We leaving it alone? 
NINA Yes. 
ERICA Let me see. 
Nina stares back defiantly. 
ERICA (CONT'D) Take off your shirt. 
NINA No. 
Erica starts to come towards her. 
The DOORBELL RINGS. 
Erica looks at Nina questioningly. Nina shakes her head. 
Erica goes to the door and cracks it open, keeping the chain engaged. 
ERICA (to person outside) Can I help you? (pause) I'm sorry, she's not in. 
Erica shuts the door. Nina rushes out to see who it was. 
NINA Who was it? 
Erica doesn't answer. 
Irritated, Nina walks around Erica and quickly opens the door to find out. 
ERICA It's no one. 
60 INT. BUILDING HALLWAY- NIGHT 60 
Nina sees a ballerina walking away from the door. 
WAITER Let me know if it's not juicy enough. 
LILY Oh, I will. 
He smiles, keeping his eyes locked on Lily, as he rudely plops down Nina's plate. 
WAITER Enjoy. 
Lily watches him go, then notices Nina looking annoyed. 
LILY What? 
NINA Guess I'm invisible. 
Lily studies her and digs into her purse. Pulls out a SEXY SHIRT. 
LILY Here, wanna spruce up? 
Nina gives her a puzzled look. 
LILY (CONT'D) I always carry a spare, case I wake up somewhere unexpected. 
Lily picks up her ungainly burger and takes a big bite, a little grease dripping down her chin. Nina cuts into her dry chicken breast. 
LILY (CONT'D) Not like you need more attention these days. How is he? 
Nina doesn't understand the question. 
LILY (CONT'D) Thomas? 
NINA I wouldn't know. 
LILY Yeah, right. 
NINA I don't want to talk about it. 
LILY Relax, you're so tense. 
Lily pulls out a cigarette case and clicks it open. Inside, CIGARETTES and a couple PILLS. 
LILY (CONT'D) One for you... 
Lily grabs one of the pills and slides it over. 
LILY (CONT'D) And one for me. 
Lily grabs her pill and downs it with a beer. 
Nina stares at her pill, too embarrassed to admit she doesn't know what it is. 
LILY (CONT'D) Don't worry, it's pure. Brought it with me straight from San Francisco. 
NINA What is it? 
LILY You're kidding? You never rolled? 
Nina blinks. 
LILY (CONT'D) Oh boy. It'll just make you have a good time. Loosen up. See the night sky. 
NINA (CURIOUS) How long does it last? 
LILY Couple hours. Tops. 
Nina looks at the pill, thinks about it for a second... 
NINA That's okay. 
LILY Sure? 
Nina nods. Lily puts the pill back, and SNAPS the case closed. 
62 INT. GRUNGY BATHROOM - NIGHT 62 
Wearing the SKIMPY SHIRT Lily offered her, Nina rinses her mouth out with water from the sink, then checks herself out in the mirror. 
It's broken and covered with graffiti and stickers. One particularly bright one says, "Seize the Day-glo." 
Nina's cell phone RINGS. She checks the ID--"MOM"--and silences it. 
Nina puts her SWEATSHIRT back on over the shirt, and exits. 
63 INT. CORNER BISTRO - NIGHT 63 
Nina returns to her table, but when she gets there, Lily is gone and the table is cleared. 
She looks around the crowded room, doesn't see her anywhere. 
She heads towards the exit, and sees Lily at the bar, flirting with TWO ATTRACTIVE MEN. She's very touchy-feely. 
TOM You've got some mouth, you know that? 
LILY Isn't that compliment a little premature? 
Lily sips her drink, staring at Tom flirtatiously. 
NINA You guys should come sometime. I can comp you tickets. 
Tom laughs, amused by Nina's earnestness. 
TOM Yeah...that'd be neat. 
LILY I think we all need another round. Bottom's up. 
She looks at Nina and sucks down her drink, challenging her to follow suit. Nina takes a breath of courage and empties her glass. 
She waits for something to kick in. 
LILY (CONT'D) Tom, come with me? 
Lily slips out of the booth and Tom follows, leaving Nina and Andrew alone. She avoids his gaze, nervous. 
ANDREW So...what are you guys working on these days? 
Her cell phone RINGS, interrupting him. She quickly turns it off and gives him an embarrassed smile. 
NINA Sorry. Swan Lake. 
ANDREW Yeah? 
NINA You know it? 
ANDREW Oh, no, not really. Heard of it though. What's it about? 
NINA It's about a girl who's been turned into a swan. She needs love to break the spell. 
ANDREW Okay. 
NINA Yeah, but her prince falls for the wrong girl and she kills herself. 
ANDREW So a happy ending, then? 
NINA It's beautiful, actually. 
ANDREW Like you. 
She starts to feel the initial tingles of the drug. 
NINA Huh? 
ANDREW I said you're beautiful. 
She giggles. 
ANDREW (CONT'D) That funny? 
She gives him a flirtatious glance. 
NINA My hands are all sweaty. 
Andrew touches them. She grabs onto his hands. She looks at his face. His eyes twinkle at her. 
Lily slides in next to her. Nina sees her and melts into her body. Lily hugs her back. 
LILY Uh oh! Looks like someone's rolling. Let's get you dancing. 
A65 OMITTED A65 
65 INT. DANCE CLUB - NIGHT 65 
Nina kisses Tom on the floor of a crowded dance club. The drug is in full effect. 
The world has soft edges, colors are vivid and bleed into one another. 
Lily twirls her around. 
Nina attaches herself to her, hungry for the attention. A cheering section of guys surrounds them. 
Nina lets loose. Dances with abandon. 
66 INT. CLUB BATHROOM - LATER 66 
Nina makes out with someone, her back pushed up against the wall. Her eyes are closed, she's shiny with sweat. 
She opens her eyes, confused to find that it's not Andrew or even Tom, just a STRANGE MAN. 
She backs away. He reaches for her, but she swats him off. 
67 INT. DANCE CLUB - SAME 67 
72A INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - SAME 72A 
She grabs the broken PIECE OF WOOD from the dresser and jams the door. She backs Lily away, preparing for the storm. 
NINA Don't come in here! 
Erica tries to open the door, but it gets stuck. She peers her eye through the crack. 
ERICA What's this? 
NINA It's called privacy! I'm not fucking twelve years old anymore! 
Erica struggles a little with the door, but can't get it to budge. 
ERICA You're not my Nina right now! 
NINA LEAVE ME ALONE!!! 
Nina SHOVES the door shut. 
Erica's FOOTSTEPS retreat, followed by the SLAM of her bedroom door. 
72B Nina is worked up, breathing hard. 72B 
LILY (O.S.) Whoa... 
Nina turns around and sees her Double smiling at her. 
Nina flees to the door. Pauses. She peeks back and sees that it's actually Lily. 
Relieved, she grabs Lily and kisses her, revved-up. 
Lily responds with equal force. They claw at each other, passion exceeding coordination. 
Lily pulls Nina's shirt off and throws her onto the bed. 
She straddles Nina, who looks up at her carnivorously. 
Lily takes her own top off, plunges down and kisses Nina. 
Nina flips Lily over, becomes the dominant one. 
Lily scratches Nina's back, over some of the rash. 
There's subtle movement underneath the skin. Little pin pricks push up the flesh, trailing behind her hand. 
Self-conscious, Nina grabs Lily's hand and holds her wrists down. 
She bites her neck. Lily smiles, likes the violence. 
She digs her nails into Nina's hands. 
Then Lily gets back on top of Nina. The tattooed lilies on her back undulate and spread out. Morphing into dark wings. 
She kisses down Nina's body. Further and further... 
Lily starts to go down on Nina. 
Nervous, Nina whimpers. Glances down and sees the DOUBLE. 
She tries to pull away. 
LILY shushes her. 
Nina calms back down, seeing that it's her. She takes a breath and succumbs. 
Bumps shoot up all over her skin as her breath quickens. 
She closes her eyes, allows the sensation to invade her body and CLIMAXES. 
She breathes her way back to earth. Slowly her eyes open. She rolls over towards Lily. But Lily is gone. 
Instead her DOUBLE hovers over her. 
DOUBLE Sweet girl. 
She SMASHES a pillow over Nina's face. 
CUT TO: 
A73 OMITTED A73 
73 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 73 
Nina lies alone in bed, the sheets and comforter in disarray. 
She sits up, clutches her head in pain. 
She looks around, but there's no sign of Lily or the Double. 
LILY (CONT'D) What, you have some kind of lezzy wet dream? 
Nina glances at the dancers, nervous they've heard. 
NINA You're lying. 
LILY (TICKLED) Oh my god, you totally fantasized about me. 
NINA Stop. 
LILY Was I good? 
NINA (BARKS) Shut up! 
Other dancers look over. 
Nina resumes stretching. Lily just walks away. 74-76A. 
A77 INT. STAGE - DAY A77 
Nina dances the end of the ballet, the White Swan's suicide. 
LEROY The Black Swan has stolen your love. There's only one way to end the pain. 
Nina climbs the stairs of the set and arrives at the "cliff," stopping at the precipice. 
LEROY (CONT'D) You're not at all fearful. Filled with acceptance. 
Nina looks down. It's a short drop to a stack of pads, but a HARD FLOOR surrounds it. 
LEROY (CONT'D) You look at the Prince, then down at Rothbart, and, yes, up at the audience...And jump! 
She hesitates, fearful. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Go ahead. You'll be fine. 
Nina takes a breath and leaps in a swan dive. 
She falls...and lands in the pads, unhurt. Slight applause from the other dancers. 
LEROY (O.S.) (CONT'D) Everybody get a drink then it's notes. 
Nina lies in the pads, completely exhausted. 
B77 INT. BACKSTAGE - LATER B77 
Nina sits backstage, toweling herself off. 
She pauses, noticing Leroy and Lily conversing near the doorway. 
Lily nods and touches his arm. He smiles warmly, then notices Nina watching. His serious demeanor returns and he pulls away. He says goodbye to Lily. 
Lily follows his gaze and smirks at Nina, rubbing it in, before exiting herself. 74-76B.

A81 INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT A81 
Nina kneels in front of the toilet, a finger down her throat. She gags, but nothing comes up. 
Her eyes tear up, and she tries again, but still just heaves. 
Frustrated, she wipes her mouth and flushes. 
81 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 81 
Nina exits the bathroom and approaches her mother's bedroom door. It's closed, but the light's on underneath. 
She's about to knock, but hesitates. Through the door, she can hear the sound of her mother watching an INFOMERCIAL on TV. An unfamiliar, lonely noise. 
Nina stands there for a moment, just breathing. She strengthens her resolve and backs away from the door. 
82 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 82 
Nina collapses on her bed. 
She opens the JEWELRY BOX sitting on her night stand. 
She watches the ballerina spin for a moment... 
Then suddenly SLAMS the lid shut and throws the box hard against the wall. 
She shoots out of bed and starts gathering all her childish possessions--stuffed animals, dolls, keepsakes, etc. 
NINA No, she's different. She's after me. She's trying to replace me. 
LEROY (CONDESCENDING) Nina... 
NINA Please believe me. 
He studies her for a moment, not sure what to make of this. 
LEROY Listen, I know it's been a struggle. But you had a breakthrough this morning. 
Nina starts to speak, he holds up his hand to silence her. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Tomorrow is yours. Give a great performance, and you won't have to worry about Lily, or anyone else. 
NINA THOMAS- 
LEROY No more. Go home and rest. 
Shut down, she watches him walk away. 
84 OMITTED 84 
85A INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - NIGHT 85A 
Nina practices the Black Swan, alone with the jaded piano player, working herself hard. 
He suddenly stops playing. 
NINA What happened? 
PIANO PLAYER I gotta life, deary. 
He closes the music book and stands. 
PIANO PLAYER (CONT'D) Don't work too hard. It's your big day tomorrow. 
Annoyed, she watches him leave. 
85B She faces herself in the mirror and takes a breath. 85B 
She resumes dancing without music, her feet CLICKING on the floor. 
As she moves, she notices something strange out of the corner of her eye: 
The reflection's dancing lags a little behind hers. 
Nina stops. The sound of her footsteps stops a second later. She stares at the mirror...troubled. 
The door to the room BANGS shut. 
She whips towards it and she's suddenly plunged into DARKNESS. 
Freaked, she stumbles towards the door, and pushes out into THE 
86A INT. STAGE - NIGHT 86A 
Where it's equally dark. Lit only by the stage's "ghost light," a single bulb on a stand. 
NINA Hey! Hey! I'm still in here. 
No one answers. 
She looks at the cavernous auditorium. All those empty seats, faced towards her. Very overwhelming... 
She hears a noise in the wings. 
NINA (CONT'D) Hey! Turn the lights back on! 
She gets to the other side of the stage, but the wings seem empty. Quiet. 
86B Then she hears the faint sound of MUFFLED BANGING. 86B 
NINA (CONT'D) Hello? 
No one answers. 
She heads towards the noise. The banging now accompanied by a GIGGLE. 
87 INT. WINGS - SAME 87 
It's pretty dark but the sound is unmistakable: two people going at it. 
Nina tiptoes past some off-stage SETS and LIGHTING EQUIPMENT. 
And peeks around a piece of SCENERY... 
Catching a glimpse of Leroy fucking Lily further backstage. She's wild, clearly enjoying it. 
Nina looks away, disgusted. She peeks back one more time. 
90 INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR - SAME 90 
She hits the GROUND FLOOR BUTTON, and hides in the corner. 
As the doors close, she looks down and sees that, in one hand, she holds the BLOODY EMORY BOARD. 
She drops it, disgusted. 
91 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 91 
Nina runs in and quickly shuts the door behind her. Takes a breath, and notices some blood still on her hands. 
A92 INT. KITCHEN - SAME A92 
She flips on the light. The room's empty. 
She goes to the sink and washes her hands. 
She finishes, and flips the light off as she walks out of the room. 
She pauses, rushes back and flips on the light. The Double stares at her from the corner, her face covered in blood. Terrified, Nina runs. 
B92 INT. BATHROOM - SAME B92 
She goes straight to the toilet and VOMITS. 
She hears a creaking sound in the apartment and looks towards the open door. 
NINA Mommy?! 
She goes out to investigate. 83A. 
92 INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - SAME 92 
Nina flings open the door, but Erica's not in there. 
She hears RUSTLING, then WHISPERING. 
Nina looks around the room. The paintings of herself seem to move slightly. Blink. Mouths move. 
They whisper: "Sweet girl" and then start chanting "My turn, my turn, my turn!" 
Nina cups her hands over her ears, trying to block it out. 
She hears a BANG and looks towards the door. No one's there. 
She glimpses the mirror, which reflects down the hallway. She sees her Double rushing towards the room. 
Scared, Nina whips around, just as her mother arrives in the doorway. 
ERICA What are you doing? 
Nina pushes past her, in a frenzy. 
93 INT. BEDROOM - SAME 93 
Nina closes the door. Sticks in the broken piece of wood. 
A pain shoots through her shoulder. She SCREAMS, instinctively reaching for it. 
She quickly yanks off the sweater and looks at the vanity mirror. 
Her back pulsates unnaturally. Tiny black tips poke through. 
The door opens and catches on the doorjamb. 
Erica starts POUNDING. 
NINA GO AWAY! 
She digs into the open bump on her shoulder with her fingernails. 
ERICA Open the door!!! 
Erica violently pushes and pulls, jostling the piece of wood. 
Nina concentrates, takes hold of the growth and yanks. 
Blood vessels in her eyes explode, making the white turn red. 
Nina looks at the object held in her fingers: a sharp, TINY BLACK SPINE. Like that of a sea urchin. Damp, feathery wisps hang off of it. 
The door flings open. 
Erica rushes in and finds Nina half-naked, her skin inflamed. 
ERICA (CONT'D) Oh my god... 
Nina starts forcing her out the door. Erica pushes back. 
Nina rushes from the wings, directly into David's arms. 
All the swans are frozen in two rows on each side of the stage, looking downstage. 
David launches Nina into the air, hands around her waist. 
He slowly turns her around, keeping her held high. 
From her swirling, bird's eye view, Nina sees the rows of identically dressed Little Swans glaring at her... 
Nina freaks, jerking her body. 
David's grip SLIPS and Nina SLAMS onto the stage. 
It's a horrific moment that feels like an eternity. 
Gritting her teeth, Nina looks up around her, sees the faces of the other ballerinas. Staring at her sadistically. 
Nina finds Lily, glancing at David. He snaps to and quickly helps Nina up. 
DAVID What the fuck? 
She's too freaked to respond. 
They resume dancing, Nina barely keeping it together. 
Behind them, Rothbart appears and commands his flock to exit. The Little Swans start swirling off stage. 
Leaving Nina and David alone. 
David tries to pull her in one direction, but the dark hand of Rothbart summons her, transforming her back into a swan. 
She pulls away from David, frantically flapping, until she disappears into the wings. 
105 INT. BACKSTAGE - SAME 105 
As soon as she's off, she breaks down, hyperventilating. The dancer playing ROTHBART eyes her with concern. 
ROTHBART You alright? 
She looks up, sees his creepy MASK, and backs away. 
Rothbart has to go back on stage to finish the Act. 
Other CORPS MEMBERS surround her, chirping "You okay?, "What happened?" etc. 
Dazed, Nina doesn't answer. The music ends and there's a weak smattering of applause. 
STAGE MANAGER That's intermission! Act 3 in fifteen. 
The other dancers scurry to get ready, abandoning her. 
Nina sees Leroy on stage chewing David out, behind the closed curtain. 
David spots Nina, glares at her, and sulks away. 
Leroy runs his fingers through his hair, his back to Nina. 
Nina cautiously approaches. 
NINA It wasn't my fault. He dropped me. 
He can't even look at her. 
LEROY (RAGING) What a fucking disaster! 
He walks away. 
All alone, Nina sees everyone backstage looking at her. 
She runs, escaping their stares. 
106 OMITTED 106 
107 INT. PRINCIPLE'S DRESSING ROOM - SAME 107 
She closes the door behind her, ready to cry. 
She looks up, and finds Lily putting on makeup and wearing the Black Swan costume. 
LILY Rough start, huh? Pretty humiliating... 
NINA Get out of here. 
LILY Wow...rude. 
Lily coyly smiles, and continues applying makeup. 
LILY (CONT'D) I'm worried about the next act. Not sure you're feeling up to it. 
STAGE MANAGER That's you! 
She leaps back on 
111C STAGE 111C 
For the Coda. She takes a brief pause, closing her eyes once more, and then completely lets herself go. 
She spins with ferocity. More BLACK FEATHERS burst out from her shoulders and back. 
At last, she truly embodies the Black Swan. 
She finishes the Coda, punctuating her last spin with a sharp step that echoes through the theater. 
The audience looks on, mesmerized. Too stunned to clap at first. 
111D Nina looks down at the stage, her face glazed with sweat 111D 
She has returned to normal. No feathers. Normal eyes. A woman. 
She finally looks up at the audience, and they ERUPT in a standing ovation. 
Nina walks to the front of the stage, takes her bow. 
Nina looks up at the MASS OF BODIES filling the auditorium, vibrating with applause. 
Proud, Nina smiles and bows again. Again and again. 
She finally runs off stage, the applause still going strong. 
112 INT. BACKSTAGE - SAME 112 
Nina enters the wings, other dancers cheer loudly. Even Veronica and Galina. 
She pushes past all the smiling faces. It feels very surreal. 
She sees Leroy clapping and shaking his head. Blown away. 
LEROY Get back out there! Get back- 
She stops his mouth with a kiss. The kind of kiss that you can't stop. Not desperate, but adamant. 
Finally she disengages, staring at him in the eyes, but before he can say anything... 
She turns and rushes back on stage. He's stunned. Like he's been run over by a truck. 
113 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - LATER 113 
She walks towards her dressing room, a satisfied smile on her face. 
She passes the stage manager. 
STAGE MANAGER Great job. You got fifteen til the last act. 
She nods and arrives at her room. 
She opens the door, makes sure no ones looking, and enters quickly. 
114 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 114 
She closes the door behind her, locks it. Turns and sees the broken glass all over the floor. 
She eyes the closed wardrobe. A pool of blood drips out from under the door. 
She picks up a towel and lays it over the blood. 
She starts to undress. 
115 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 115 
Back in the White Swan costume, she re-applies the makeup. 
There's a KNOCK on the door. She looks towards it, her face only halfway made-up. 
NINA One second. 
She goes to the door, opens it just a crack. 
She peeks through and finds... 
LILY looking back at her. 
LILY Hey...you were amazing. 
Nina's petrified. 
LILY (CONT'D) Seriously. I'm sorry things got so messed up between us. Just, holy shit, totally blown away... 
Nina barely manages a nod.

INT. KAREL PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY - DAY 
OVER BLACK 
PAT What, are you kidding me? Sundays? I love Sundays. I live for Sundays. The whole family's together. Mom makes braciole. Dad puts the jersey on. We're all watching the game. Yeah, it drives me crazy, and yes, I was negative. 
FADE IN ON: 
INT. KAREL PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY/PAT'S ROOM - DAY 
PAT SOLATANO stands in the middle of his room, his back to camera. 
PAT (CONT'D) You didn't even know that I loved it, Nikki, but I did. I just didn't appreciate it, or you, before." There is a knock at the door. 
MALE ORDERLY (O.S.) Come on. Time to go. 
PAT I lost all that. I blew it. But you also blew it. We can get it back. We're gonna get it back. It's all gonna be better now. I'm better now and I hope you are, too. And I'm 
GONNA APPRECIATE--" Another knock at the door. Pat ignores it. 
PAT (CONT'D) Hey, I'll be there in a minute, okay? 
MALE ORDERLY (O.S.) Doctor's waiting. Let's go. 
PAT I'll be there in a minute. Pat returns to his speech. 
PAT (CONT'D) That's true love. See glimpses of Pat's room: mayonnaise jar filled with water, black trash bag strewn on the bed, handwritten sign taped to Pat's wall, "EXCELSIOR". 
INT. PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY/ HALLWAY - DAY 
PAT HURRIES DOWN THE STAIRS. 
INT. PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY/ DISPENSARY - DAY

INT. PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY/ROOM - DAY 
A GROUP OF PATIENTS SEATED IN A CIRCLE WITH A DOCTOR, HAVING 
A GROUP THERAPY SESSION. PAT IS INCLUDED. 
DANNY Yeah, that's when I had long hair. People say I talk about my hair too much. 
DANNY SITS BETWEEN TWO OTHER MALE PATIENTS. 
DANNY (CONT'D) And it was just the way I wanted it, but he cut it back too far. He cut this side back too far trying to even it up. I didn't tell him to do that. I said, "Just cut it the way you cut it...." 
PAT Once you get in the right frame of mind, I think anything's possible. I think we get, we so often get caught in this state of negativity and it's a, it's a poison like nothing else. 
EXT. PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY - DAY 
PAT works out: drinks water from his plastic mayo jar, does squats, sit ups, push ups --

CAMERA TILTS UP OVER A MALE DOCTOR, DR. TIMBERS, AS HE WALKS 
WITH DOLORES. PAT FOLLOWS. CAMERA MOVES BACK WITH THEM. 
DR. TIMBERS ...technically, you can take him out against our recommendation, but you assume a lot of liability in the eyes of the court. And he's just getting used to the routine here.

DANNY OPENS THE REAR PASSENGER SEAT AND GETS INTO THE CAR 
WITH HIS SUITCASE. 
DANNY I guess everybody's leaving today! Hello, Mrs. S. An honor to finally meet you. Pat told me all about you, how God made you rich in character, and you're the mighty oak that holds the household together, and not to mention the lasagna you make on game day when the Birds play.

DANNY That was when I was an X-ray technician with my ADD and my anxiety. I had a lot of access to medication and I took advantage of it. That's when my hair was long, too. But my hair only grew when I was older. When I was younger, my hair didn't grow because my brother...

PAT SR. (turns, sees Pat) What?! What's this?! 
RANDY Hey. 
PAT SR. STEPS CLOSER, PATTING PAT ON THE ARM.

PAT You still got yours? 
PAT SR. Yeah, I got mine. 
PAT SR. LOOKS AT DOLORES. 
PAT SR. (CONT'D) So what, you don't talk to me? You didn't tell me you took him out. 
DOLORES Well, he's ready. Look at him. 
PAT You didn't tell Dad you were picking me up? 
DOLORES Don't worry about that. 
PAT SR. I wanna make sure when you come out that you're okay, and she didn't say anything. (to Dolores) You didn't tell me? 
DOLORES The court said yes. Don't worry. 
PAT SR. Yeah, but what did the doctor say? Because the, the court listens to the doctor. 
PAT Yeah, and the court said-- 
PAT SR. The court listens to the doctor, 
THE DOCTOR-- 
PAT Dad, relax. The court said it's fine, okay? Let it go. 
DOLORES Don't worry. 
PAT Dad, I'm in there because of the court. That's the agreement that we made months ago. It was a plea bargain with the courts. The lawyer, he instructed me, he said that what we should plead that, and then I would serve eight months and then I'd get out. 
PAT SR. Yeah, no, I just-- 
DOLORES It's all under control. 
PAT SR. Well...okay, okay. Congratulations. 
PAT Thank you. So what are you doing with yourself? 
PAT SR. You know, I'm gonna start a restaurant.

PAT SR. I'm gonna pay for it, don't worry about it. 
PAT From your bookmaking? 
PAT SR. Who told you that? 
PAT Mom told me. Outside. 
DOLORES I did not. No, I didn't. 
PAT You just told me outside, Mom, what are you talking about? Five minutes ago, we were walking up the stairs, you said, "Don't say anything, but Dad lost his job and he's bookmaking." 
PAT Handkerchief? 
PAT SR. Yeah. 
PAT SR. STRAIGHTENS THE REMOTE CONTROLS. PAT SITS.

PAT ENTERS R., STANDING UP. 
PAT SR. (CONT'D) Just sit down, come on. I want you to watch the game with me. I'm not superstitious. That's a small thing that I do. If I make a lot of money, what's the difference if I do this or that? It's a small thing. Sit down. Come on.

NANCY You shouldn't be here. 
PAT SR. As soon as you left, the Redskins threw a trick play, a pitch out to Randal El. Andy Reid wastes a time- out challenging it, loses the challenge, loses the game. You're in this house, please show some respect for what I do. And we should spend time together anyway. I'm trying to keep you out of trouble, please.

PAT You know what, I knew why they invited me over. I knew it. 
PAT SR. Listen, she might be with that guy. That, the.... 
PAT Oh, no way!

PAT 
(TEARFULLY) Don't talk to me like that.

INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/FOYER - DAY 
PAT SR. OPENING THE FRONT DOOR TO A POLICE OFFICER STANDING 
ON THE PORCH. HE IS OFFICER KEOGH. 
OFFICER KEOGH ...check on this house. Pat Solatano? 
PAT Yeah. 
OFFICER KEOGH Yeah? Missus Solatano, Mister Solatano, I'm Officer Keogh. I work this beat. Look, I heard about the restraining order. And I heard you went to your old house and the school. It's not okay. I've been assigned to your case, so you're gonna be seeing a lot of me. Do yourself a favor. Respect the restraining order, okay? Five hundred feet. 
PAT SR. You hear what he just said? You have a restraining order. 
PAT Yeah, Dad, I know. 
PAT SR. Thank you, Officer. 
OFFICER KEOGH If you need anything...my card.

INT. OFFICE/DR. PATEL'S OFFICE - DAY 
DR. PATEL Tell me one thing. Would you like to be a guy who goes back to jail or to the hospital? Hmm? So take your medication and if you do fine, we'll reduce them. 
PAT Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape and get my life in order, and then she's gonna be with me. And that's better than any medication. 
DR. PATEL Pat, there's a possibility, and I want you to be prepared for it, that she may not return. True love is about letting her go and seeing if she returns. In the meantime, if you listen to that song, I don't want you to fall apart. So get a strategy, okay? You need one. 
PAT Let me say something, I gotta say something. 
DR. PATEL Okay. 
PAT This is what I believe to be true. This is what I learned in the hospital. You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest, and if you do, if you stay positive, you have a shot at a silver lining. 
DR. PATEL Work on a strategy, okay? 
PAT Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this party on Sunday night and it's like a real hoity-toity thing and his wife, Veronica's a real stickler for.... I don't know, my mom got this Gap outfit she wants me to wear, but I wanna wear a jersey that my brother, Jake, got me from the Eagles. 
DR. PATEL Which jersey?

TIFFANY This is me. 
TIFFANY AND PAT STOP, FACE EACH OTHER. 
TIFFANY (CONT'D) Listen, I haven't dated since before my marriage so I don't really remember how this works. 
PAT How what works? 
TIFFANY I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat. You felt it, I felt it, don't lie. We're not liars like they are. I live in the addition around back, which is completely separate from my parents' house, so there's no chance of them walking in on us. I hate the fact that you wore a football jersey to dinner because I hate football, but you can fuck me if you turn the lights off, okay? 
PAT IS MOMENTARILY SPEECHLESS. 
PAT How old are you? 
TIFFANY Old enough to have a marriage end and not wind up in a mental hospital. 
PAT Look, I had a really good time tonight and I think you're really pretty, but I'm married, okay? 
PAT HOLDS UP HIS HAND, DISPLAYING HIS WEDDING RING.

PAT Hey, this is my route, okay? Just back off. 
TIFFANY This is my neighborhood. You just ran by my house. 
PAT I like to run by myself, okay? 
TIFFANY Me too. 
PAT (stops and turns) Hey, I like to run alone! Will you stop? 
TIFFANY What? 
PAT Okay? I'm running here! 
TIFFANY Me too! 
PAT Well then, why don't you run somewhere else? There's a fucking ton of roads to run in! What are you trying to do?

PAT (CONT'D) 
(BREATHES HEAVILY) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
TIFFANY STANDS UP. 
TIFFANY I was a big slut, but I'm not anymore. There's always gonna be a part of me that's sloppy and dirty, but I like that, with all the other parts of myself. Can you say the same about yourself, fucker?! Can you forgive? Are you any good at that? 
TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS. 
INT. OFFICE/DR. PATEL'S OFFICE - DAY 
DR. PATEL You seemed to have trouble last night. 
PAT Let me just set the record straight about last night. Hurting my mother was a mistake and I hate myself for it, and I hate my illness and I want to control it. My father, on the other hand, had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night, which I did not return `cause I could've killed him and I didn't. He's sixty-five years old. You don't think I could've beat the shit out of him? I mean.... 
DR. PATEL He was scared for your mother and you hurt him as well. 
PAT Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I think he probably just tried to do his best. 
DR. PATEL Pat, you have to have a strategy. I told you earlier. You need to recognize these feelings coming to you, otherwise you will be sent back to Baltimore. So when you get these feelings, you need to get to a quieter place, and be at peace with yourself, however you can. 
PAT Yeah, but that's easier said than done. 
DR. PATEL You have to do it. You have no choice. Excelsior. 
PAT Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a letter I want you to give Nikki, okay? 
DR. PATEL No. 
PAT Why? 
DR. PATEL Because you have a restraining order. 
PAT 
(SIGHS) What good are you, man? 
DR. PATEL Why did you have this overwhelming urgency to see your wedding video last night? 
PAT Oh, I don't know, because I'm married and I haven't seen my wife in eight and a half months? 
DR. PATEL Maybe you think that Nikki's not around and Tiffany's an attractive girl and if you get drawn towards Tiffany, you will spoil your chances of getting Nikki back to you? 
PAT Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut. 
DR. PATEL Why is she a slut? 
PAT After the dinner at Ronnie's, she said, quote, "We can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out." Unquote. And she still wears her wedding ring. So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut. 
DR. PATEL Maybe she just needs a friend and she thought if she offers you sex, it will be easier for you to become friends with her. 
PAT She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself and can I say the same? 
DR. PATEL Can you? 
PAT Is that....? You're asking me, you're really asking me that question? 
DR. PATEL Yes. 
PAT With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts? 
DR. PATEL Pat, the silver lining thing is yours. I'm just giving back your words to you. This "crazy sad shit," as you call it, made you a happier, calmer person with a beautiful positive philosophy of going outdoors, working out, and reading books. 
PAT No, not the books. 
TIFFANY And the so-called incident with the weights. 
PAT Yeah. That was a thing with my parents. I wish I could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki because it was minor and I could just explain it and let her know that I'm actually not out of control and that I'm actually doing really well. 
TIFFANY TAKES THIS IN. BEAT. 
TIFFANY I can get a letter to Nikki. I see her sometimes with my sister. 
PAT CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT HE IS HEARING. 
PAT It would be so amazing if you could get a letter to Nikki from me. 
TIFFANY I'd have to hide it from Veronica. She's not into breaking the law, which this letter would definitely be doing. 
PAT But you would do it? 
TIFFANY I'd have to be careful. I'm already on thin ice with my family, you should hear how I lost my job. 
PAT How did you lose your job? 
TIFFANY By...having sex with everybody in the office. 
PAT Everybody? 
TIFFANY I was very depressed after Tommy died. It was a lot of people. 
PAT We don't have to talk about it. 
TIFFANY Thanks. 
PAT How many were there? 
TIFFANY Eleven. 
PAT Wow. 
TIFFANY I know. 
PAT I'm not gonna talk about it anymore. 
TIFFANY Okay. 
PAT Can I ask you one more question? Were there any women? 
TIFFANY Yes. 
PAT Really? 
TIFFANY Yes. 
PAT What was that like? 
TIFFANY Hot. 
PAT Jesus Christ. Was it like...older women, a sexy teacher who wants to 
SEDUCE YOU-- 
TIFFANY Made me sit on her lap and do things? Yeah. 
PAT What? You sat on her lap? 
TIFFANY Mm-hmm. 
PAT She told you what to do? 
TIFFANY Mm-hmm. 
PAT Oh...my God. Nikki hated when I talked like this. Made me feel like such a pervert. Maybe we should change the subject. 
TIFFANY I don't mind it. 
PAT You don't, do you. 
TIFFANY No. But then people were getting into fights in the parking lot at work, and in the bathroom...and the boss called me in to his office and tried to pin it all on me. So I accused him of harassment and then they fired me, sent me home and put me on some meds. 
PAT I get it. The song that was playing when my wife...was in the shower with the history teacher... 
TIFFANY I heard about that. 
PAT ...it was my wedding song and when I hear it, I go kinda crazy. Sometimes I hear it when it's not even playing. 
TIFFANY Wow. 
PAT Yeah. So they put me on medication, which I feel ashamed of. 
TIFFANY Yeah. 
PAT So I know. 
TIFFANY You do. 
PAT I just gotta get a strategy, you know? 
TIFFANY Me too. 
PAT We'd better get back to the letter. 
TIFFANY Yeah, let's get back to the letter. 
PAT What if you told Nikki when Veronica was in the bathroom? 
TIFFANY Yes. Yes, that could work. I love that. 
PAT Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home and write the letter right now. 
PAT BEGINS TO SLIDE OUT OF THE BOOTH. 
TIFFANY Can I at least finish my tea? 
PAT Wait, what? 
TIFFANY My tea. Can I finish it? 
PAT Wait a minute. Did Veronica tell Nikki about our dinner? Why would she do that? Was it a test? 
TIFFANY I kinda got that feeling, yeah. 
PAT Goddamn it. I knew it. It was a test. How did I do? I think I did pretty well. 
TIFFANY Yeah, she said you were cool, basically. 
PAT "Basically"? Was I some percentage not cool? 
TIFFANY No, she said you were cool, but you know. 
PAT No, I don't know. 
TIFFANY Sort of how you are. It's fine, relax. 
CAMERA PANS WITH OFFICER KEOGH AS HE WALKS TO PAT, GRABS HIS 
ARM. 
OFFICER KEOGH (CONT'D) Are you being a punk on Halloween with these kids? You wanna go back to Baltimore? Is that what you wanna do? 
PAT I didn't, I didn't, I didn't-- TIFFANY WATCHES IN THE CROWD OF HALLOWEEN TEENS. Softens. 
TIFFANY It's the kids! [Walks to Pat and Officer Keogh]. He didn't do anything, it was all the kids. Officer Keogh turns to push the crowd back. 
OFFICER KEOGH (walks crowd back) Let's go, clear out, nothing going on here. 
AS -- TIFFANY LEANS IN CLOSE TO PAT WHO IS UPSET, SONG PLAYING IN HIS HEAD. Tormented. 
TIFFANY You gonna go your whole life scared of that song? It's just a song. Don't make it a monster. She leans close to Pat's downcast face. 
TIFFANY (CONT'D) There's no song playing. There's no song. Breathe, count backwards from ten. That's it. Pat breathes, listens to her. Calms himself. Song stops. Tiffany's face stays close to his. 
TIFFANY (CONT'D) That's it. There you go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
PAT I'm sorry. 
TIFFANY I took it too far. 
PAT I'm sorry. 
OFFICER KEOGH (pulls her away) Hey, is he messing with you? 
TIFFANY No, no. No, this was just a joke. This is a joke I started. 
OFFICER KEOGH There's a restraining order on this guy. 
TIFFANY I know, I have a stupid sense of humor. 
OFFICER KEOGH That's not a good thing to do. 
TIFFANY Well, I'm fucked up. What can I tell you? I'm sorry. 
OFFICER KEOGH You're Tommy's widow, right? 
TIFFANY Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow, minus the whore thing for the most part. 
OFFICER KEOGH You're a funny girl. You wanna get a drink sometime? 
TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS AWAY. 
OFFICER KEOGH (CONT'D) What'd I say? 
PAT She doesn't, she doesn't do that anymore.

PAT I didn't mean it at all. 
TIFFANY I know, you say shit you don't mean all the time. 
PAT All the time. 
TIFFANY I'll still give your letter to Nikki, don't worry. TIFFANY WALKS THE DRIVEWAY TOWARD HER GARAGE. Pat watches her go. 
PAT Wow. I really appreciate that, Tiffany. 
TIFFANY 
(WALKING AWAY) I know you do. 
PAT You do?

RANDY I'll bet I know what happened if only one is missing. Either Dolores or Pat needed an envelope and one of `em took it. That's the only answer. 
PAT SR. No, no, no. 
DOLORES, PREPARING FOOD IN THE KITCHEN. 
PAT SR. (CONT'D) Dolores, somebody was in my study. Who took one of my envelopes? Somebody took an envelope. 
DOLORES Maybe we should call the FBI. 
PAT SR. Don't make fun. This is serious. What FBI? Come on, let's take a look. I'll show you what this is. I'm gonna just explain to you something. I mean, you know what I'm doing, honey. This everything, like this. I got this, it all corresponds. 
PAT ENTERS. 
PAT Dad, I borrowed one of your envelopes. I hope that's not a 
PROBLEM 
PAT SR. No, it's not okay. It's not okay. You gotta ask. 
DOLORES "Do not go in my study or I will eat you!" 
RANDY LAUGHS 
PAT SR. It's not funny, it's not funny. What's everybody making a joke out of this for? 
RANDY Dolores, you are so beautiful! 
PAT SR. 
(TO RANDY) Stop that! Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop, stop! 
(TO PAT) Listen, a lot of envelopes go in and out of my office every day after games with a lot of cash in `em. So show some respect for what I do. 
PAT Yeah, I know. I saw two-seven-four. I just wanted to tell you the number. 
PAT SR. Thank you. 
PAT But the envelope was empty. I'm sorry, you were sleeping. I didn't want to wake you, but I needed an envelope. 
PAT SR. You didn't want to wake me? (to Dolores and Randy) He didn't want to wake me. He doesn't have a problem complaining about Ernest fucking Hemingway. He doesn't have a problem asking for his wedding 
PAT You gotta get your marriage together. 
RONNIE 
(WHISPERING) I start breaking shit, and I hurt my hand. And -- 
PAT Ronnie, that's fucked up. 
RONNIE Yeah, but it makes me feel better. It's like my therapy, you know? 
PAT When I'm with Nikki, I'm never gonna do stuff like that... 
JAKE (O.S.) Whoa, Nikki? What's all this about Nikki? Pan from the framed photo of Jake on foyer wall, to Jake on the stairs above. 
JAKE (CONT'D) A restraining order is nothing to fool with, bro. [Walks down to Pat]. Holy shit, look at you! You are fit! You look absolutely amazing. You feel good? 
PAT How you doing, Jake? 
JAKE Good. You look like Schwarzenegger in his prime. 
DOLORES Didn't I say you wouldn't recognize him? 
JAKE So, listen, I'm sorry that I didn't come see you down at the hospital. You know how those places creep me out, and the firm's been expanding. I've been helping Pop with the restaurant `cause he needs to have a legitimate business. He needs a tax return. With all the money that he's making with his bookmaking, they're gonna come after him. And then it looks like I'm making, I'm gonna make partner at the firm. Pat just stares at Jake. The room is silent. 
JAKE (CONT'D) Well, I don't even know what to say to you anymore. You lost your wife, I'm getting engaged, and I wanna be able to tell you about those kind of things. You lost your house, I'm getting a new house. You lost your job, things are going great for me at the firm. 
PAT SR. Maybe stop talking about all the stuff that's good for you and bad for him. Just, you know, leave it alone. We're watching the game. 
JAKE You know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna stop talking. I'm gonna shut my mouth. Pat stares down Jake. Tense. 
PAT As my friend Danny would say 00 The room hangs on Pat's words. 
PAT (CONT'D) I got nothing but love for you, brother. 
PAT SMILES. TENSION EASES. PAT AND JAKE EMBRACE. 
DANNY That's right. That's right. 
RONNIE/RANDY/DANNY/DELORES (O.C.) That's nice. That's nice. 
DOLORES INHALES TEARFULLY. 
PAT SR. Well, thank God, finally. 
PAT DeSean Jackson. 
JAKE Yeah. Did it fit? 
PAT I wore it to Ronnie's for dinner. 
RONNIE Beautiful jersey. I love that jersey. 
PAT Veronica didn't like it. 
RONNIE Veronica hates the jersey. 
JAKE Whatever you do, watch out for that restraining order, okay? 
JAKE PATS PAT'S CHEST AND WALKS TO SOFA. 
PAT I'm not doing anything! 
RONNIE Don't let Tiffany get you in trouble. 
DOLORES Pat, you're up to something, I know. 
PAT People like Tiffany, or Danny, or me, maybe we know something that you guys don't know, okay? Did you ever think about that? Maybe we understand something because we're

HOSPITAL. 
DOLORES Oh, no. 
OFFICER KEOGH How you doing, Pat? 
PAT Jesus. 
PAT SR. I guess his sixth sense forgot to tell him the cops were coming. 
OFFICER KEOGH 
(RE: DANNY) I'm taking him back to the hospital. 
PAT What? No, no, he passed his thing, right? 
RANDY LAUGHS 
DANNY First of all, check with the latest legal development. 
OFFICER KEOGH Well, we got a call that they did convert you to a Mental Hygiene Law admission status by the deadline of your sentence, so.... 
PAT SR. 
(TO KEOGH) Wait a minute. Are you an Eagles fan or are you not an Eagles fan? 
OFFICER KEOGH I'm an Eagles fan. 
PAT SR. Well then, what's the problem? He's not goin' anywhere. Just let him finish the game, that's all. The handkerchief is working. We're killing the Seahawks, twenty-seven- ten. What's the matter with you? Let him stay, please! 
OFFICER KEOGH I don't know what the hell you're talking about "the handkerchief". And I'm glad that the Seahawks are losing and we're winning, but I gotta take Danny McDaniels back to Baltimore, alright? He can contest his case from Baltimore. 
DANNY STANDS UP. 
DANNY Not correct about the Mental Hygiene Law. You're not correct. 
OFFICER KEOGH Come on. 
DANNY ENTERS R. AND OFFICER KEOGH GRABS HIS ARM. THE

PAT Did you just throw that outside? 
TIFFANY What? You're not gonna read that shit on my time. I can tell you all about the "Lord of the Flies." It's a bunch of boys on an island and they have a conch -- they have a shell -- and whoever has the conch has the power and they can talk. And if you don't have the conch, then you don't have the power. And then there's a little chubby boy, and they call him Piggy and they're really mean, and then there's a murder. I mean, humanity is just nasty and there's no silver lining.

PAT GROANS. 
PAT SR. (CONT'D) We got a serious situation on our hands, you know that. Pat looks concerned, he could be in trouble. 
PAT SR. (CONT'D) We gotta beat the Giants if we wanna have a chance of getting into the division, any chance of playing in the playoffs. Do you realize that? 
PAT I didn't realize that. 
PAT SR. Yeah, that's the bind we're in. I mean, I think it would be wise if we spent father-son time, reading about the Eagles, talking about them, just to strengthen the good luck thing that you're in. 
PAT Okay. 
PAT SR. Yeah? 
PAT Right. 
PAT SR. Hmm? 
PAT SR. LOOKS AWAY. 
PAT SR. (CONT'D) I just wanted to, maybe I didn't, spend enough time with you growing up. I spent too much time with your brother. It might have made you feel worse about your behavior, but I didn't know anything, I didn't know how to handle it. I mean, that's what all this Eagles stuff is about. It's about us, spending time now. I wanna do everything I can to help you get back on your feet. That's the whole point. Yeah. I wish you'd watch these games with me so we could talk, we could get into things. (inhales) So would you, would you just come downstairs and talk to me and Randy now? 
PAT SR. TOUCHES PAT'S CHEEK. PAT, MOVED, NODS.

RANDY He's betting everything on the Giant game. Everything. 
RANDY (CONT'D) All the money that he needs for the restaurant, he's betting on the Giant game. 
PAT SR. Tell him why. 
RANDY Because he believes in you. 
PAT Is that true? 
PAT SR. I believe in you, Patty. I believe in you. I want you to know that. So I'm gonna bet heavy on this game. 
DOLORES STARES INTENSELY AT PAT. 
PAT SR. (CONT'D) You understand? 
PAT Yeah. 
PAT SR. Heavy. I want you to go to the game with your brother. 
PAT You want me to go to the game with Jake? 
PAT SR. Of course I do. 
JAKE Does he want me to go? 
PAT SR. Of course he wants you to go. 
PAT He told you that? 
PAT SR. He told me, yes. 
PAT Even with all his friends? 
PAT SR. With all his friends. He trusts you. 
PAT He's not embarrassed? 
PAT SR. No. I'd love to go to the game, too, but as you know, I'm banned from the stadium. `Cause I'd love to see us beat the Giants and take a lot of money from this asshole. 
RANDY Listen, personally, I think it's a stupid bet. As a matter of fact, I think it's ridiculous to bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game. 
PAT SR. Randy. (to Pat) I just hope you heard what I said. It's like a family business, it's our family endeavor. We all stick together on this. That's how it works. That's a positive, positive vibe. 
PAT I made a commitment to Tiffany about a project, and we have a very important part of it that we have to go over on Sunday, and it's good for me, Dad. It's making me disciplined and focused, and it's, it's--, I never would've thought this, but it's a good thing. 
PAT SR. What is this thing you're doing? 
DOLORES Yeah, what is it? What is this project, hon? 
PAT It's a dance thing, okay? There's nothing more to it, Dad. I swear.

PAT Hey, Jake this is Cliff. This is my doctor, Cliff. 
JAKE Look, two things. We gotta watch that bubble screen for fuckin' Manning in the backfield and we gotta make sure we knock the receivers on their ass on the line of scrimmage.

PAT Why don't you wanna talk to Veronica? 
RONNIE Because she brings me down, man! She just brings me down. 
PAT You have to change. You're not gonna throw the marriage away. There's some kind of love there. I know, I used to see it.

INDIAN MAN Hey! 
TIFFANY We need to talk right now! When you make a serious commitment to somebody, it is not cool to not show up! 
PAT Wait a second, I tried to call, my God, what's happening, I called--, but I tried to call you, Tiffany, 
I-- 
PAT SR. Who is this? What is this? 
TIFFANY Oh, really? 
PAT Yes. 
PAT (CONT'D) I told you I was gonna split my time with my dad and you, and my dad was pulling me in one direction. Doctor Patel, Ronnie-- 
TIFFANY Well, that sounds great, Pat. That's great for all of them, but all of them didn't make a commitment to me in return for my help. I'm Tiffany, by the way. 
PAT SR. What is this craziness with Tiffany Maxwell? 
PAT There's no craziness. I told you who she was, I was doing this thing with her. We had a conversation! 
PAT SR. She's fucking nuts! When you started spending time with her, it all fell apart. This is the fucking reason right here. 
TIFFANY You think I fucked up the Eagles' juju, don't you? 
PAT SR. Ever since, ever since he was with you, ever since-- 
TIFFANY 
(INTERRUPTING) You think that I'm why today's happened? 
PAT SR. That's right, you are why today happened. 
TIFFANY I'm the reason why today happened? 
PAT SR. I think so. 
TIFFANY Let's talk about that. 
PAT SR. Be my guest. 
TIFFANY The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's, the Eagles beat the Forty Niners handily, forty to twenty-six. The second time we got together we went for a run and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to five in the NLCS. 
JAKE She's right, Dad. 
TIFFANY The next time we went for a run the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty- seven to fourteen. 
PAT Wow. 
TIFFANY The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World Series, ten to two. 
PAT Oh, wow. 
PAT SR. Let me think about that. Wait a minute. 
TIFFANY Well, why don't you think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, fourteen to seven. 
PAT SR. He was with you? 
TIFFANY He was with me. We went for a run. 
RONNIE Really? That's crazy. 
TIFFANY There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants. 
JAKE She's making a lot of sense, Pop. That's all right on all counts. 
TIFFANY Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the State of New York? Huh? Anybody? (to Pat Sr.) Do you? Do you know? "Excelsior." Look it up. Yeah, "Excelsior." 
DOLORES Oh Pat. 
TIFFANY Not that I give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is "Excelsior," to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation. 
RONNIE Unbelievable. 
PAT Wow. How did you know all that stuff?

PAT Oh, now you like her, Dad? 
PAT SR. I have to say I do. Yup. 
RANDY Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know? You made the bet, I won a lot of money, and now look, your whole family is in turmoil.

PAT Is that right?

RANDY That's bullshit! That's not true! Don't say that! 
TIFFANY You get off on it! If not, then prove it. Prove it. 
PAT SR. Yeah, prove it, prove it! 
RANDY How do you want me to prove it? 
PAT SR. How's he gonna prove it? 
TIFFANY By giving them the chance to win back everything, double or nothing. 
PAT No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

RANDY When is the game? 
(FOLLOWS HIM) Here we are again at the one yard line. DeSean, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. There you go. 
PAT What does that even mean, Dad? I'm not gonna make that, that, that connection that you're making with DeSean Jackson. It doesn't matter anymore okay? Just because I have the fucking jersey on...I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry.

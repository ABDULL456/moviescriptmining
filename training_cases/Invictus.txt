EXT. ALL-WHITE HIGH SCHOOL, WESTERN CAPE - DAY 
A big, rich, powerhouse all-white high school located near the freeway into Cape Town. The RUGBY FIELDS are immaculate. FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOYS in striped rugby jerseys train with total intensity under the critical eye of the COACH. 
Right ACROSS THE BOUNDARY FENCE from the rugby fields is an area of WASTE LAND leading up to the freeway. There, BLACK AND "COLORED" (MIXED-RACE) BOYS of the same age play a loose game of soccer with a tennis ball. Most of them have bare feet and threadbare, dirty clothes, most of them are noticeably smaller and skinnier than the white boys. 
Two cultures, separated by more than the high boundary fence. 
SUPER TITLE: SOUTH AFRICA, FEBRUARY 11, 1990 A COMMOTION ON THE FREEWAY intrudes on the soccer game. Horns honking, cars pull over onto the shoulder, people jump out. 
EXT. FREEWAY - DAY 
Lead by police motorbikes, then patrol cars, a white Mercedes approaches, heading towards Cape Town. Whoever is in the Mercedes has stopped traffic. 
EXT. ALL-WHITE HIGH SCHOOL, WESTERN CAPE - DAY 
The soccer players abandon their game and run for the freeway, whistling and shouting. 
The rugby players are more disciplined -- or obedient -- and do not acknowledge the commotion until the convoy passes right by them. The coach shakes his head in disgust. 
HIGH SCHOOL BOY Who is it, sir? 
COACH It's that terrorist, Mandela. They let him out. (BEAT) Remember this day, boys. It's the day our country went to the dogs. 
CUT TO: 
A short, STOCK-FOOTAGE MONTAGE which spans the tumultuous four years between NELSON MANDELA'S release from prison and his inauguration as President of South Africa. 
Footage would include: 
- Mandela's release from prison - negotiations with the apartheid regime - scenes of white fear and emigration - the horrifying sectarian violence leading up to the ELECTIONS - the khaki-clad AWB (Afrikaner right wing) attack on the World Trade Center (where negotiations were taking place) - the lifting of economic sanctions and cultural boycotts - the lifting of the international ban on the Springbok rugby team and immediate Test match losses to New Zealand and Australia. - popular black leader Chris Hani's assassination by white RIGHT WINGERS - black retaliation - Mandela's frantic intervention to keep the country from going up in flames - the election itself, with those incredible images of thousands and thousands of people, black and white, lining up patiently, some to vote for the first time in their lives - the African National Congress victory - Mandela's inauguration as President, where he delivers the FAMOUS WORDS: 
"Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another, and suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world." 
As APPLAUSE FADES ... 
GO TO BLACK: 
INT. MANDELA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Dark. We can make out the FORM OF A TALL MAN SLEEPING ALONE at the very edge of the big bed, as if not wanting to rumple the blankets too much. 
On the bedside table, the clock clicks from 4:59 to 5:00. The man's eyes open in the dark, instantly awake. He reaches out, switches on the light. 
NELSON ROLIHLAHLA MANDELA, 76, sits up and gets out of bed in one movement. He has the physical vigor and energy of someone twenty years younger. 
The second he is up, he turns around and makes his bed, leaving it as flawlessly smooth as a hospital bed. Or a prison bunk. 
For this is the discipline of twenty seven years behind bars. 
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Dressed in a tracksuit and cross-trainers, Mandela comes down the stairs and heads for the front door. 
This is a nice, big house but it is amazingly modest for the President of a wealthy nation, and arguably the most famous man on the planet. 
EXT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Mandela steps outside, closes his front door quietly, takes a moment to savor the air. It is bone dry and cold -- typical conditions in the Highveld at this time of year. 
It is so quiet that, for a moment, it seems as if Mandela is completely alone in the world. 
The big yard is fenced. There is a small GUARD HOUSE at the driveway gate. 
When Mandela steps away from the house, A UNIFORMED SOUTH AFRICAN POLICEMAN IN THE GUARDHOUSE pushes the button that opens the gate. 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
When the gate begins to open we see that there are TWO GREY BMWs parked either side of it. 
INT. GREY BMW - NIGHT 
LINGA MOONSAMY comes to full alert as the gate opens. He is a big, scowling man dressed in a suit. He checks the load on a pistol, tucks it into his shoulder holster. 
LINGA Here he comes. Like clockwork. 
JASON It makes him such an easy target. 
Behind Linga, in the back seat, sits JASON TSHABALALA, a naturally tense and suspicious man. Both of them are hollow- eyed, exhausted, running on adrenaline. 
They get out of the BMW, fast and quiet. This does not look good. 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
As Mandela walks out through the gate, Jason and Linga intercept him. 
JASON (traditional greeting in XHOSA) I see you, father. 
Mandela's face comes alive as he smiles. 
MANDELA (without breaking stride) Morning boys. How are you? 
Jason is Mandela's head of personal security, Linga his number one bodyguard. They are both former "terrorists", and they are utterly devoted to Mandela. 
JASON We're sharp, Madiba. 
MANDELA Good ... good. And how's your mother doing, Linga? 
LINGA She's much better, thank you. 
MANDELA Good. 
MR. PIENAAR I feel sorry for you, son. You've got your whole life ahead of you. What's it going to be like now? 
MRS. PIENAAR (late 40's) enters holding some kind of PROTEIN SHAKE for Pienaar. 
MRS. PIENAAR Don't be so gloomy. (handing over shake) I added vitamins -- there's a horrible flu bug going around. Tell Nerine when you get home. 
PIENAAR Thanks, ma. 
MR. PIENAAR I'm telling you, Francois -- look at Angola, look at Mozambique. Look at Zimbabwe. We're next. They're going to take our jobs and drive us into the sea. Just you wait. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY 
Magnificent, sweeping government buildings made of carved African field stone, with an Italian tiled roof, situated on a hill overlooking Pretoria. The seat of power. 
Today, the entrance is mobbed with a huge, joyous, multi- racial throng, plus news crews from all over the world. Lots of new South African flags evident. 
We move through the throng and swoop up into the air, so that we can soar along the outside of the building and LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOWS into the offices of state -- 
-- where people who worked for the De Klerk regime are packing up, in anticipation of being booted out by the Mandela regime. These characters run the gamut from little old Afrikaner tea ladies in tears, to the stoic fossils of grand apartheid. They are all white. A good third of the offices are already deserted. 
The deserted offices have open doors. Through a window, through an open door, we see Mandela and his bodyguards striding down a Union Building hallway. 
We swoop in through the window -- 
INT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY 
-- and catch up with the new President. Mandela is regal in a magnificent tailored suit. Jason in front, Linga behind. 
PORTRAITS of the architects and champions of apartheid look down sternly on them as they pass. 
They pass a WORKER hanging a PORTRAIT OF MANDELA next to one of De Klerk, the previous President. 
ON LINGA, as he smiles at that. 
Mandela, on the other hand, looks into the empty offices, and into the offices being packed up. 
Up ahead, the double doors to the OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, are closed. Jason speeds up, opens them, pokes his head in, then opens the doors wide. 
JASON (with great pride) After you, Mr. President. 
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - DAY 
Mandela's offices are fronted by a LARGE RECEPTION AREA, already filled with PEOPLE WAITING TO SEE HIM. 
To one side are his CHIEF OF STAFF'S SUITE of offices, to the other side, the SMALL PRESIDENTIAL SECURITY OFFICE. 
Beyond these are MANDELA'S SECRETARIES, TYPISTS AND ASSISTANTS -- his gatekeepers. 
Beyond that is the inner sanctum, MANDELA'S OWN OFFICE. 
The phones are ringing off the hook. Fax machines are chattering. Everyone wants a piece of Mandela. 
Mandela enters, Jason and Linga behind him. 
MANDELA Good morning everybody. 
ALL (GREETINGS) 
BARBARA MASEKELA, Mandela's CHIEF OF STAFF (and now Ambassador to the U.S.), emerges from her office, carrying an arm load of files, folders and papers -- 
MANDELA Barbara, good morning. You've had your hair done. I like it. 
-- accompanies Mandela back towards his office. 
BARBARA Thank you, Madiba. We need to talk about your cabinet appointments and ministers. 
MANDELA Give me one moment, please. 
Barbara waits outside Mandela's office, as he enters ahead of her. 
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY 
Mandela stands in the middle of his office, takes a moment to savor where he is. 
Then, he takes off his jacket, hangs it up and is ready for work. 
MANDELA BARBARA -- 
Barbara enters. 
MANDELA -- please assemble the staff for me. Whoever has not already left. 
BARBARA Right now? All of them? 
MANDELA Yes, please. 
CUT TO: 
INT. UNION BUILDING STAFF DINING ROOM - DAY 
What's left of the UNION BUILDING STAFF are packed into the DINING ROOM. White faces, bitter and resentful. Waiting to be fired. 
Through the glass doors, THEY SEE MANDELA APPROACHING DOWN THE HALLWAY, Linga and Jason with him. 
STAFF MEMBER#1 Here he comes. 
STAFF MEMBER#2 He wants the satisfaction of firing us himself. 
They stand up straight, determined to receive the ax with pride. 
INT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY 
Linga and Jason amp up when they see the room full of restless Afrikaners. At the STAFF DINING ROOM DOOR, Mandela turns to them. 
MANDELA I'd like you to stay out here, please. 
JASON But, Madiba ... 
MANDELA I cannot talk to them if I'm hiding behind men with guns. 
Mandela opens the doors and enters. Jason and Linga stay outside ... just. 
JASON I don't care if they're signed or -- 
Jason does a double-take when he sees the signature on the orders: NELSON R. MANDELA. 
JASON Wait here. 
Jason storms out, holding the orders. The four black bodyguards seethe with hostility. The four white bodyguards stare straight ahead, refusing to give ground. 
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY 
Mandela and Barbara look over a position paper on something or other. When Jason knocks and enters, they pause. 
JASON Sorry to disturb you. 
MANDELA You look agitated, Jason. 
JASON That's because I've got four Special Branch cops in my office. 
MANDELA What have you done? 
JASON Me? Nothing. They say they're the Presidential bodyguard. They have orders. (BEAT) Signed by you. 
MANDELA Yes. They've had special training, those boys -- with the SAS. And lots of experience. They protected De Klerk. 
JASON Yes, but -- 
MANDELA You asked for more men, didn't you? 
JASON Yes, but -- 
MANDELA In public, when people see me, they see my bodyguards, too. You represent me, directly. The rainbow nation starts here. (BEAT) Reconciliation starts here. 
JASON Reconciliation? Madiba, not long ago they tried to kill us! Maybe even these four guys. They tried and, often, they succeeded! 
CUT TO: 
INT. SECURITY OFFICE 
Linga, Sam, Winston and Kwezi stare down Etienne, Hendrick, George and Willem. 
BACK TO: 
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY 
Mandela stares at Jason in an entirely different way -- with wisdom, compassion and sympathy. 
MANDELA Yes, I know. (VERY GENTLY) Forgiveness starts here, too. 
Mandela lets that sink in for a moment. He knows he asks for something very difficult, but he demands it of himself to an even greater degree. 
MANDELA Forgiveness liberates the soul. It removes fear. That is why it is such a powerful weapon, Jason. (MORE) 
MANDELA (CONT'D) (BEAT) Please try it. 
Jason exhales. He isn't remotely ready to forgive. 
JASON Yes, Madiba. Sorry to disturb you. 
Jason turns, leaves. Barbara shakes her head at Mandela. 
BARBARA You ask a lot. 
MANDELA Only what is necessary. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - DAY 
As Jason -- very upset -- walks back to security, Jessie holds out a file for him. 
JESSIE Two copies of the schedule. 
Jason snatches the file, keeps walking. 
JESSIE Thank you, Jessie! 
When he reaches the security office door, Jason walks right past, keeps going, has to make a full loop of the reception area, just to get himself together. 
Even so, when he gets back to the security office door, Jason pauses, gathers himself to do something that he knows he's going to hate. 
INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY 
Things haven't eased up one little bit inside the office. The silence is deafening. Jason enters, looks them all over. His face is grim. 
LINGA Can we get rid of these guys, now? 
Jason flashes a look at Linga, then -- and this hurts him, visibly -- he holds out one of MANDELA'S SCHEDULES to Etienne. 
JASON This is his schedule for the next month. Let's look it over for duty assignments. 
ETIENNE Right. 
LINGA What? 
Linga and the others are shocked. 
LINGA Jason, I have to talk to you. Outside. 
Linga virtually pulls Jason out of the office. 
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - DAY 
Just outside the Security Office door, so they keep their voices low. 
LINGA How can we trust them? JASON We can't. (heading back in) This is what Madiba wants, okay. 
Not okay for Linga, judging by the expression on his face. 
INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY 
When Jason and Linga enter, Etienne looks up from Mandela's schedule. 
ETIENNE Are there any special orders or conditions? 
Crowd noise increases. They know the opening whistle is about to blow. 
Then, Mandela sees something in the crowd, at field level. 
MANDELA'S POV: A GROUP OF ROUGH-LOOKING WHITE MEN WAVE THE NEW SOUTH AFRICAN FLAG AT HIM. 
WITHOUT WARNING, MANDELA CHANGES DIRECTION, heads towards this group, towards a wall of his former -- and perhaps current -- enemies. 
ON JASON: shit! 
JASON (INTO RADIO) Stay with him. 
ETIENNE Stop him. 
JASON Stay with him. 
With his bodyguards scrambling to stay in position, Mandela reaches the stands, hand outstretched, leans into the crowd. 
MANDELA Thank you for honoring our new flag! 
Some shake his hand, some -- very pointedly -- do not. 
The crowd noise takes on an ugly undertone -- Mandela is delaying the rugby. 
Mandela is undeterred. He's into this one-on-one outreach. He turns, looks for more hands to shake -- 
-- and Jason steps in between Mandela and the crowd. 
JASON We're delaying the rugby, Madiba. 
MANDELA Oh, yes, of course. 
Mandela gives one last wave, turns away. 
As he does, SOMEONE WINDS UP AND THROWS SOMETHING from the stands. 
Jason and Etienne catch the movement, whirl, too late. 
AN ORANGE WHIZZES PAST MANDELA'S HEAD, explodes juicily on the field. 
Mandela didn't see it, doesn't react. If anything, his smile widens as he heads across the field. The bodyguards close around him protectively, get him back to the tunnel. 
INT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM - TUNNEL ONTO FIELD - DAY 
Jason signals for extra bodyguards to escort Mandela all the way up to his box. Hendrick, the biggest, leads the way. 
Jason stays in the tunnel, along with Etienne. Both men are in a muck sweat, adrenaline coursing through them. 
ETIENNE Why didn't you stop him? 
JASON Next time, you try. 
ETIENNE Does he do that sort of thing all the time? 
JASON Ask my ulcer. (BEAT) Good thing that was just an orange. 
ETIENNE And good thing he never saw it. 
JASON Oh, he saw it. He sees everything. (rubbing his ulcer) I hate rugby. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM - DAY 
Two international front rows come together with bone- crunching force. 
Huge, violent men grunt like bulls. The crowd roar vibrates the stadium. The scrum -- a phalanx of eight men locked together against eight -- wheels, buckles, then steadies under the watchful eye of the referee. 
Fanning out behind each scrum are the backs -- faster, more glamorous players who will run with the ball, or kick it. 
The Lions scrumhalf thrusts the ball into the maw of the scrum, the huge men lock up against each other with maximum force. 
The ball comes out the back of the Lions' scrum, the scrumhalf dive-passes it away to the backs, who flick it out laterally to the wing, with lightning speed. 
The wing lofts a delicate kick just over the onrushing Springbok defenders. The Lions charge the ball, which bounces erratically -- 
-- right into the hands of the man who kicked it. One last burst of speed, one quick juke to avoid a desperation tackle, and the wing scores in the corner. 
As the Lions kicker gets ready to convert the try, we find the Springboks huddling under their goal posts, hands on their hips, stunned. 
At the center of the huddle Pienaar bleeds behind his gum guard as, furiously, he tries to inject some fire into his team. 
PIENAAR Concentrate, dammit! Focus! We can beat these guys if we play our game, not theirs! 
ON PIENAAR, as he realizes he is not getting through. There is dullness, shock in his player's eyes -- 
-- which all lift to the heavens as the CONVERSION KICK SOARS through the uprights. 
We FOLLOW THE KICK as it drops past a GIANT SCOREBOARD. 
STAY ON THE SCOREBOARD as it registers the conversion and shows the score: LIONS - 10 SPRINGBOKS - 0 
INT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM VIP BOX - DAY 
In the VIP box, Mandela turns his back on the field as the game restarts beneath him and continues in the background. He has BINOCULARS around his neck. 
MANDELA Shall we work while we watch? We have lots of promises to keep. 
Barbara sits to his right, with her ever-present files and folders. 
BARBARA Yes, we do. 
Mary pours tea at the back of the box. Linga stands two steps behind Mandela. 
On Mandela's left, sits the PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICAN RUGBY, a small man with a small man's ruthlessness and drive. 
MANDELA It's not too late, if the boys can just pick up their game. 
RUGBY PRESIDENT If they don't, heads will roll. This is unacceptable. (LEANING FORWARD) Come on you bloody bastards! 
Mandela's expression shows that he has a gentleman's distaste for profanity. He turns to Barbara. 
BARBARA Where do you want go first, for foreign investment? 
CUT TO: 
INT. UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY - DAY 
Mandela addresses the General Assembly, thanking them for their support in the fight against apartheid. 
MANDELA The millions of our people say thank you, and thank you again. 
Linga and Hendrick are his closest bodyguards. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WHITE HOUSE - SOUTH LAWN - DAY 
Mandela addresses diplomats, members of Congress, black leaders at a made-for-TV ceremony on the South Lawn. 
MANDELA I have come here with a message. People of the Unites States of America: Open your markets to us. People of the United States of American: Come and invest in our country. 
Linga, Jason, Etienne and Hendrick are in on this one -- a little island of South Africans in a sea of U.S. SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY 
We are in a COURTYARD behind the palace. Drawn by four white horses, A ROYAL CARRIAGE (an open carriage) pulls up, stops. The courtyard quickly fills with liveried footmen, then security guards. 
QUEEN ELISABETH and Mandela emerge from the palace. Footmen open doors on both sides of the carriage. The Queen and Mandela climb in (the Queen on the right hand side). 
When they sit down next to each other, Mandela leans over and says something to the Queen that makes her giggle ... 
... almost. For Queens do not giggle. 
The carriage pulls forward and these two human icons sit up straight, as they get set to face the world. 
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ... and in London, President Mandela made quite an impression on the Queen -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. PIENAAR PARENT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
ON TV: footage of Mandela with the Queen, riding down the mall waving to ecstatic crowds. 
TV ANNOUNCER -- as he concluded a gruelling trip TO-- 
Mr. Pienaar MUTES THE TV, so that he can deliver the latest one-liner to Mrs. Pienaar. 
MR. PIENAAR In related news, it was announced that President Mandela will be visiting South Africa this week. 
Mrs. Pienaar laughs. 
IN THE BACKGROUND, in the kitchen, a plump, middle-aged Tswana woman washes the dishes and keeps an eye on the TV. This is EUNICE, the Pienaar's maid. 
She does not find Mr. Pienaar's joke amusing. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. JOHANNESBURG AIRPORT - NIGHT 
The PRESIDENT'S JET taxis towards the familiar BMW, Mercedes, BMW convoy. 
CUT TO: 
Mandela disembarks, very slowly. He is exhausted, his feet are swollen, his knee hurts. This is a very different man than the one we have just seen wooing the world. 
He is met at the bottom of the stairs by Hendrick. 
HENDRICK It's good to be home, sir. 
Mandela just nods. Too tired to talk. 
Hendrick escorts Mandela to the Mercedes, opens the door for him. 
Mandela takes a step towards the open door -- and staggers. 
Reflexively, Hendrick reaches out, steadies him. 
MANDELA I'm fine. 
Mandela steps out of Hendrick's hands, holds onto the open door. 
MANDELA Travelling the world, begging for money, is very tiring. 
Mandela reaches into his jacket, pulls a SMALL PACKAGE out, hands it to Hendrick. 
MANDELA This is for you. 
Mandela slides into the car. Once the door is closed, Hendrick glances at the package. We don't see it. It is too dark. 
But we do see that Hendrick is amazed by it. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GREY BMW - NIGHT 
Hendrick is being driven home through the Highveld night. He chews on something really sticky, chewy. He pauses to dislodge some of it from a tooth, before it pulls out a filling. 
Then, he resumes chewing. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. MANDELA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
On the bedside table, THE CLOCK clicks from 4:59 to 5:00. Mandela's eyes open in the dark ... close for a second ... then shoot open again.

CUT TO: 
EXT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The bodyguards' BMW's flank the gate. As the gate opens -- 
-- Linga gets out of one BMW, Hendrick gets out of the other. They are alert. It is freezing cold. 
Pienaar comes back, stands in the doorway, a stunned expression on his face. 
NERINE What? Who was it? 
Pienaar doesn't answer immediately. 
MR. PIENAAR Told you. It was his girlfriend. 
MRS. PIENAAR Shush! 
PIENAAR I've been invited to tea. 
NERINE Who with? 
PIENAAR The President. 
MR. PIENAAR The President of SA Rugby? Count your fingers after he shakes your hand. 
Pienaar points at the muted TV. 
PIENAAR The President. 
ON THE TV: footage of Mandela with a group of SAUDI PRINCES. 
Eunice turns and looks at Francois, wide-eyed. 
The Pienaar family all stare at the TV, stunned. 
PIENAAR He wants me over for tea, week after next. 
Eunice picks up her handbag, puts on her coat and heads for the door, stops when she reaches Pienaar. 
EUNICE Mr. Francois -- you must tell Madiba that the bus service is very bad, and too expensive. He must please fix it. (LEAVING) Good night everybody. 
MRS. PIENAAR Good night Eunice, thank you. 
All eyes on Pienaar. 
MR. PIENAAR What the hell does he want with you? 
Pienaar shakes his head -- he has no idea.

Nerine's modest little car heads towards the seat of power. 
INT. NERINE'S CAR - DAY 
Nerine drives. Pienaar wears a blue blazer, grey slacks and subdued tie -- and is surprisingly nervous. 
NERINE Francois, relax. You've met him before. 
PIENAAR I shook his hand on the rugby field, that's all. 
NERINE You didn't even vote for him. 
PIENAAR He's still the President. (CONFESSING) He's had dinner with the Queen. With Presidents and movie stars. All I do is play rugby. What if I pull something stupid in front of him? 
Nerine stops to let Pienaar out. Gives him a kiss, straightens his hair. 
NERINE You won't. I'll pick you up right here. 
EXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY 
Pienaar climbs out of Nerine's car. 
A pretty sizeable KNOT OF JOURNALISTS rush towards him. 
Pienaar takes a deep breath. He is a bundle of nerves. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY 
Small office packed with big men. 
ETIENNE See who's coming for tea? 
HENDRICK My nephew wants me to get his autograph. 
LINGA Who? 
ETIENNE Francois Pienaar. 
JASON Who wants to escort him in? 
Hendrick bolts for the door. 
HENDRICK I will. 
JASON No autographs. 
HENDRICK (INSULTED) I know how to do my job, okay. 
Hendrick leaves. 
LINGA Who's this Pienaar? 
ETIENNE You can't be serious? He's the captain of the Springboks. 
Linga shrugs, provocatively indifferent. 
LINGA I like soccer, myself. 
ETIENNE Well, you know what they say about soccer -- it's gentleman's game played by hooligans. One the other hand, rugby is a hooligan's game played by -- 
LINGA Ja, ja, I've heard it before. It wasn't funny the first time. 
Not exactly violin music and roses ... but they are talking to each other. 
INT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY 
MANDELA Mrs. Brits, this is Francois Pienaar. He's the captain of the Springboks. 
Mandela clearly expects Pienaar to shake hands with Mrs. Brits. Pienaar holds out his hand -- 
PIENAAR (AFRIKAANS GREETING) Aangename kennis, Mevrou Brits. 
-- gently shakes hers. 
MRS. BRITS Ek ook, Meneer. (TO MANDELA) Shall I pour, sir? 
MANDELA No thank you, I think I'd like to. 
Mrs. Brits leaves. Mandela does not sit until the door closes behind her. Pienaar only sits after he does. 
Mandela's manners would not be out of place in Victorian England. 
MANDELA How do you take your tea, Francois? 
PIENAAR Milk and sugar, please. 
Mandela pours tea for both of them. 
ON PIENAAR, as, just for a moment, he realizes that here he is, with the President pouring him a cup of tea. 
MANDELA The English have given us many things, including rugby, but afternoon tea is one of the greatest. 
Mandela hands Pienaar the tea cup. 
PIENAAR Thank you, sir. 
Both men have big hands. Fine china dwarfed and threatened. 
In the exact moment that both their hands hold the same saucer, Mandela looks Pienaar in the eye. 
MANDELA You have a very difficult job. 
PIENAAR I do? I sell gas braais. 
Mandela lets go and Pienaar takes the tea. 
MANDELA Captain of the Springboks. A very difficult job. 
PIENAAR Not compared to yours, sir. 
MANDELA Ah, but then nobody is trying to tear my head off while I'm doing mine. 
Pienaar grins. True. 
MANDELA It is not so difficult to get people to do their best. And I imagine that anybody who plays for their country does their best, almost automatically. 
PIENAAR Or they wouldn't be chosen in the first place. 
MANDELA Yes. But to get people to be better than that? (MORE) 
MANDELA (CONT'D) Better than they think they can be? Now, that is difficult, I find. 
PIENAAR Yes sir, it is. 
MANDELA How do we do that? By example? To an extent. But there is more to it than that ... (searching for the right WORD) ... inspiration, perhaps. 
Pienaar is engrossed. This is a master lesson on leadership, from a master. 
MANDELA How do we inspire ourselves to greatness, when nothing less will do? How do we inspire everyone around us? (BEAT) Sometimes, I think, by using the work of others. 
Long pause. Pienaar knows to keep quiet. 
MANDELA On Robben Island, when things were very hard, I found inspiration in a poem. 
PIENAAR A poem? 
MANDELA A Victorian poem. Just words. But they helped me to stand when all I wanted was to lie down -- (SUDDENLY DISMISSIVE) But you didn't come all this way to hear an old man talk about things that make no sense. 
PIENAAR No! They make a lot of sense, sir. (BEAT) On the day of a big match, say a test, in the bus on the way to the stadium, nobody talks. 
MANDELA Yes ... yes. Everybody is preparing. 
PIENAAR When I think we're ready, I have the bus driver put on a song I've chosen; a theme song. One we all know. We listen together and ... it helps. 
MANDELA Yes! I remember when I was a guest at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. The whole stadium welcomed me with a song. (BEAT) At the time the future -- our future -- seemed very bleak. But to hear that song, in voices from all over our planet ... it made me very proud to be South African. It helped me to come home and do better. It allowed me to expect more of myself. 
A beat. 
PIENAAR May I ask what the song was, sir? 
MANDELA Well, it was Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika. A very inspiring song. 
Mandela looks into Pienaar's eyes. 
MANDELA We need inspiration, Francois. 
Brown African eyes, blue African eyes meet over their cups of tea. 
MANDELA Because, in order to build our nation, we all need to exceed our own expectations. 
Something passes between them. Whatever it is has a profound impact on Pienaar. 
PIENAAR Yes, sir. We probably do.

When Pienaar steps outside and sees all of Pretoria -- all of South Africa -- stretching away below him, he pauses. He looks at his country in a new way. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY 
THE MINISTER OF SPORTS BRIEFS MANDELA on the World Cup, with the help of a BIG DIAGRAM ON AN EASEL (just like a March Madness bracket layout, showing all the teams.) The Minister looks ragged, exhausted. 
MINISTER OF SPORT Four pools of four teams each, playing in nine different venues around the country. Two teams will advance from each pool to the quarter finals. 
Mandela studies the diagram. He loves this stuff. 
MANDELA The Ivory Coast qualified. This is wonderful. 
(For the record, the sixteen teams who qualified were: South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Canada, Romania, Italy, France, Japan, West Samoa, Argentina, Tonga and Ivory Coast.) 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SPRINGBOK TRAINING FACILITY - DAY 
The Springbok squad leap up after the push-ups, sprint to the 50 m line, drop, begin 20 rapid crunches -- 
-- under the critical eye of the new COACH and MANAGER. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY 
MINISTER OF SPORT Australia won the previous World Cup. New Zealand won the one before that. (MORE) 
MINISTER OF SPORT (cont'd) They're both clear favorites to reach the finals this time. (BEAT) According to the experts, we'll reach the quarter finals, and no further. 
MANDELA According to the experts, you and I are still supposed to be in jail. 
That brings a grin from the Minister of Sport. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SPRINGBOK TRAINING FACILITY - DAY 
The coach blows his whistle. 
COACH Again! 
ON PIENAAR, as he leaps to his feet, leads the charge back to the 25 m line. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY 
MINISTER OF SPORT You make a personal appearance at the finals, and at the opening match between the Springboks and Australia. (BEAT) The finals will be broadcast to over a billion people around the world, live. 
MANDELA A billion people watching us! (wheels turning in his HEAD) Yes ... yes. This is a great opportunity. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SPRINGBOK TRAINING FACILITY - DAY 
Hands on their knees, sucking air, retching, the squad has worked their way down the full length of the field. 
SPRINGBOK MANAGER I reckon you've knocked the stuffing out of them today. 
COACH I haven't even begun. (BEAT) We may not be the most talented team in the world -- but we're going to be the fittest. 
He blows his whistle. 
COACH And back! The squad can't believe their ears. No one moves. Except Pienaar. 
PIENAAR Come on boys, let's show him. 
Staggering more than sprinting, Pienaar heads towards the 25m line. 
SPRINGBOK FLANK Shit, what's Pienaar been eating? 
But, they follow him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY 
Alone in his office, Mandela looks at the World Cup diagram, for a moment, then picks up his phone. 
MANDELA (INTO PHONE) Please call the head of South African rugby for me. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY 
Thirty completely wiped-out athletes. Some are too tired to shower, some have made it that far, but are too tired to change. 
Pienaar has showered and changed and slumps next to his locker. 
The SPRINGBOK MANAGER enters, followed by the RUGBY PRESIDENT. 
Pienaar and the boys drag themselves upright. 
The Rugby President looks them over as if they were his very own stable of race horses -- a stable he's not entirely sure he likes. 
RUGBY PRESIDENT Afternoon men. It's good to see you working so hard. I have a short announcement. (BEAT) As part of the PR buildup to the World Cup, you will be conducting coaching clinics in townships all over the country. 
The players greet this announcement with complete silence. 
RUGBY PRESIDENT I know you have plenty on your plates already -- but this is a request that comes from the top. (looking at Pienaar, POINTEDLY) The very top. 
The Rugby President turns on his heel, and leaves, followed by the Manager. 
The players say nothing for a long moment, but body language alone shows that they are completely disgusted. 
SPRINGBOK HOOKER This is complete crap. 
SPRINGBOK FLANK Are we some kind of circus act now? 
SPRINGBOK LOCK We don't have time for kuk like this. 
The boys are getting angrier by the second. 
SPRINGBOK MANAGEMENT CREW#2 THIS GOES TO WHOEVER COLLECTS THE MOST GLASS! 
Mayhem, as kids sprint out across the field, hunting for glass. Sipho goes for the tiniest, most treacherous shards. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LUXURY BUS - DAY 
The bus hits a rut in the dirt road with an almighty jolt, which wakes the sleeping Springboks. 
They look out of the windows and see the absolutely hellish outskirts of the township. Every possible incarnation of poverty, as far as the eye can see. 
This shocks them. Most of them have never been anywhere like this township. 
SPRINGBOK LOCK Shit, I'm glad I don't live here. 
EXT. TOWNSHIP - DAY 
The driver sounds the horn, as they pull into the township. 
INT. LUXURY BUS - DAY 
The bus pulls up at the field -- 
EXT. TOWNSHIP - DAY 
-- which is covered with kids on their hands and knees. 
INT. LUXURY BUS - DAY 
SPRINGBOK HOOKER What the hell are they doing? 
The driver sounds the horn again, and the kids on the field sprint for the bus, hands and pockets full of broken glass. 
PIENAAR Don't forget, we've got TV cameras on us at all times. 
SPRINGBOK LOCK (MUTTERING) What a bloody joke. 
EXT. TOWNSHIP - DAY 
As the kids approach the bus, they dump their broken glass under the banner, which reads -- 
ONE TEAM, ONE COUNTRY 
-- brown, green, white, blue shards tinkling and piling up, like lethal jewels, backlit in the low winter sun. 
One of the big kids gets the R100. Attention focussed on THAT -- 
-- until the bus door opens with a loud hiss of hydraulics and the Springboks exit, one by one. 
Pienaar first, with a huge NET BAG OF PRACTISE BALLS over his shoulder. 
The Springboks are all so big, so strong, so healthy, they look like gods, or aliens, emerging from a spaceship. The kids go quiet, awed and uncomfortable. 
Until Chester Williams steps off the bus, and there is a collective sigh of recognition and wonder. 
Now, the kids can relate to the Springboks. Even Sipho, who looks on from the side of the field. 
Springbok management notes it. 
The TV crews note it. 
Pienaar notes it. 
PIENAAR Okay Chester -- I reckon you're up. 
CHESTER WILLIAMS (PANICKING) What am I supposed to do? 
PIENAAR What you do best. 
Pienaar turns to the throng. 
PIENAAR WHO WANTS TO PLAY RUGBY? A roar. They all do. 
Pienaar opens the net bag full of rugby balls, gives a ball to Chester. 
PIENAAR Let rip. 
Chester boots the ball out over the crowd, high and incredibly far in the thin winter air. (60 yards, easily.) 
Pienaar tosses balls to the others. 
PIENAAR Let's do our best. 
One after another, the Springboks kick the balls high into the air. 
PIENAAR Go get them! 
The kids go after them. Sipho stays on the sideline. 
BEGIN RUGBY CLINIC MONTAGE 
Barely controlled chaos. Each Springbok works with one ball and a group of kids. There are THREE THEMES to this montage. 
FIRST, a primer on the basic rules of rugby, with demonstrations. 
SPRINGBOK HOOKER Who here knows the first rule of rugby? 
TOWNSHIP KID Me! 
SPRINGBOK HOOKER What is it? 
TOWNSHIP KID Only hit the other players when the ref isn't looking! 
Laughter. A good ice-breaker. 
PIENAAR No. The first rule of rugby is you can only pass the ball backwards or sideways. 
Pienaar demonstrates. (NOTE: All the rules are demonstrated.) 
VARIOUS SPRINGBOKS - If you drop the ball, or pass it forwards, you scrum for possession. - This is a scrum. - You kick forwards. (MORE) 
VARIOUS SPRINGBOKS (cont'd) If you kick it out of bounds, you throw it back in to a lineout. - This is a lineout. - You score in four ways: a try, when you dot the ball down behind the try line. That's five points. - Another two points when you convert the try by kicking the ball through the uprights. - Three points for a penalty kick. - Three points for a drop kick. - Have you got all that? 
From memory, Mandela writes the first line of the poem: 
Out of the night that covers me ... CUT TO: 
EXT. NEWLANDS - DAY 
The luxury bus comes around a bend in a leafy suburb of Cape Town, right under the flanks of Table Mountain. 
Ahead, we see NEWLANDS STADIUM, home of the World Cup opener between the Springboks and Australia. 
A magnificent old stadium in a beautiful setting. 
INT. LUXURY BUS - DAY 
All eyes on the stadium as the bus idles past, very slowly. This is a coach move. 
COACH One week, boys. 
Excited faces become grave, serious. The bus goes quiet. 
Coach nods to himself, pleased. 
EXT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - DAY 
The bus pulls away. 
WE STAY AT NEWLANDS STADIUM -- and SWOOP UPWARDS until we are looking down on the stadium and surrounding streets. 
This AERIAL SHOT BECOMES A BIG MAP -- 
INT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - SECURITY CENTER - DAY 
-- pinned to a board in the security center. 
JASON We need snipers on top of the stadium and these surrounding buildings. 
Jason leads the meeting. He uses an old-fashioned pointer. All of Mandela's security detail present, plus LOCAL COP BRASS. 
LOCAL COP Not a problem. 
JASON We want these two approaches completely sanitized. 
LOCAL COP Two approaches? JASON We're not going to decide which way we bring him in until the very last moment. (BEAT) We need uniforms, plain clothes, sharp-shooters ... 
LINGA And sniffer dogs. 
JASON Yes. No truck bombs, no Oklahoma City. 
The locals stir, share a look. This is going to be a nightmare. 
JASON We've got an army unit on standby at Silvermine, if you need more men. 
Not an option the cops favor, judging by their faces. 
JASON We're not taking any chances, okay. The President's going to be very exposed. (BEAT) Much too exposed. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - DAY 
The silver Mercedes tools into Cape Town past Groote Schuur. Mandela travels with Barbara, who opens her first file of the journey -- but is forestalled by her boss. 
MANDELA Barbara, I have been studying. 
BARBARA For the summit in Taiwan? Good. 
MANDELA No. Not exactly. 
Mandela hands Barbara a folded SPORTS SECTION. 
MANDELA Test me. 
Barbara unfolds the sports section -- 
-- to reveal COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE SPRINGBOK SQUAD. A collector's pull-out. 
Barbara looks at the photos, shakes her head. 
BARBARA They look like thugs. 
Mandela just smiles at that remark. 
MANDELA Block out the names. See if I can recognize them. 
Barbara gives her boss a put-upon look -- this is such a waste of time! -- but blocks out the first row of names. Mandela points at the first photo. 
MANDELA Andre Joubert. (NEXT PHOTO) (MORE) 
MANDELA (CONT'D) Gavin Johnson. (BEAT) Did I get them right? 
BARBARA Yes, Madiba. 
MANDELA (immensely pleased with HIMSELF) This is how I used to study in law school. (next photo is of Chester) Unfortunately, Chester is far too easy to identify. But that will change. It must. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CAPE TOWN STREETS - EVENING 
The entire Springbok squad has been on a training run through Cape Town, on ordinary streets, through ordinary people. 
(This is unthinkable in top-level sports anywhere else. It really happened.) 
When they are recognized, drivers toot their horns, pedestrians cheer, kids on bicycles ride with them (mostly still white). 
As they approach the hotel grounds, Pienaar surges to the front, so that he can give them a message as they pass through the hotel gate. 
PIENAAR Players-only meeting in the team room after dinner. 
INT. SPRINGBOK TEAM ROOM - CAPE TOWN HOTEL - NIGHT 
Normally a conference room, now equipped with fridge, pool table, ping pong, sofas, TV etc. 
The entire team has assembled, minus Pienaar. A quiet air. Serious, relaxed. 
Mandela springs out of the helicopter, energized, excited. Linga and Jason with him. 
The players assemble in a loose, semi-formal unit. Not a line, but orderly. (We may or may not notice that Chester Williams is missing.) 
Pienaar stands at the front, relaxed. He's an old hand with Mandela, by now. 
MANDELA Francois, gentlemen -- forgive me for interrupting your work the day before such an important match ... (BEAT) ... I just wanted to wish you good luck, in person. 
There is a naughty twinkle in Mandela's eye. 
MANDELA And sometimes, very seldom, as President, I am allowed to do what I want. 
They all laugh. 
Mandela wades in amongst them, leaving Linga and Jason behind. 
Picture this: Behind the barbed wire security of a modern, South African military base, a tall, regal black man in his 70's is surrounded by huge, sweating, battered, brutal- looking white men -- 
PIENAAR (DOING INTRODUCTIONS) Mr. President, this is -- 
MANDELA I know who this is. (SHAKING HANDS) Good luck, Andre. (shaking hands with all of THEM) Good luck Brendan, we're behind you all. Japie -- etc 
-- every single one of whose names he has committed to memory. Statesmanship is often about attention to detail. 
The players are awe-struck. 
(FOR THE RECORD: Andre, Gavin, James, Japie, Christiaan, Brendan, Hennie, Joel, Johan, Joost, Marius, James, Chris, Pieter, Garry, Mark, Kobus, Hannes, Krynauw, Ruben, Francois, Robby, Adriaan, Rudolf.) 
CUT AWAY to Jason and Linga, who are amazed by what they're seeing. 
LINGA Did you ever imagine this? 
JASON How could I? 
By the time Mandela has shaken every single player's hand, he has won the team over, coach and manager included. They glow. 
And then, Mandela frowns, steps back, looks at all of them. 
MANDELA But where is Chester? 
Pienaar doesn't answer immediately, he looks at his coach first. Coach nods. 
PIENAAR He's injured, sir. His hamstring. We're trying to keep it quiet. 
MANDELA Is he out for the whole tournament? 
PIENAAR With hamstrings, who knows? (BEAT) We'll miss him. 
MANDELA The whole country will miss him. 
A somewhat sour note to leave on. But it's about to be rescued. 
SPRINGBOK PROP Mr. President, sir -- 
MANDELA Yes, Hennie. 
SPRINGBOK PROP -- this is for you. From us. 
The huge, thick man holds out a GREEN CAP with gold piping and a Springbok leaping above the visor. 
Mandela takes the cap as if he has just been given a holy relic. 
MANDELA I am honored. Truly honored. 
Mandela runs his finger over the embroidered Springbok leaping across the front of the cap. 
MANDELA Good luck gentlemen. Your country supports you, completely. 
The team applauds, beaming, glowing. 
Mandela turns to go back to the helicopter. 
MANDELA Francois, walk with me. 
Pienaar walks Mandela back towards the helicopter. 
MANDELA I have something for you. 
Mandela reaches into his jacket, pulls out an ENVELOPE WITH THE PRESIDENT'S LETTERHEAD on it. Gives it to Pienaar. 
MANDELA This helped me, many times. Perhaps it will help you, too. 
CUT TO: 
Pienaar holds the envelope, stares upwards at the rising, departing helicopter, as do the rest of the team -- until Coach blows his whistle. 
COACH Enough fun and games! We've still got work to do. 
CUT TO: 
INT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - SECURITY CENTER - NIGHT 
Jason paces restlessly, going over his mental check list, making sure he hasn't missed anything. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MANDELA'S CAPE TOWN HOUSE - NIGHT 
Mandela reads, scrawls comments, signs papers from a big "In" pile. Mary enters with his glass of milk and his pills. 
MARY It's time for bed. 
MANDELA I think I'll stay up a little longer. The country is excited tonight. 
MARY You need to sleep. The doctor said. 
MANDELA The doctor has no sense of occasion. 
Mandela turns on the TV, begins flipping channels. Rugby, rugby, rugby. Mandela is sucked in. 
Mary sighs. 
CUT TO: 
The other Springboks and their partners wait to look into the cell themselves, a little puzzled by how much time Pienaar's taking. 
INT. MANDELA'S CELL - DAY 
Pienaar almost looks as if he is in a trance. He hears Mandela's voice in the cell with him. 
MANDELA (V.O.) (RECITING "INVICTUS") Out of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. 
Now, Pienaar sees Mandela in prison clothes, in the cell. (The image is unclear, ghostly.) 
MANDELA (V.O.) In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbow'd. 
Pienaar sees Mandela sitting on the dirt in the prison yard, breaking up rock with a hammer, along with rows of other political prisoners. 
MANDELA (V.O.) Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds and shall find me unafraid. 
Pienaar sees Mandela leading his fellow prisoners to the lime quarry, to mine lime under the eye of a guard who looks like Pienaar. 
MANDELA (V.O.) It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishment the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The gates open. Linga gets out of one BMW, Hendrick out of the other. We know the routine. 
Only, Mandela doesn't appear for his walk. Linga and Hendrick wait for a moment, then head in through the gate -- 
EXT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
-- break into a sprint, when they see MANDELA'S FORM, CRUMPLED on the lawn. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - MORNING 
Barbara, Mary, the house staff, plus Linga, Hendrick, Etienne and Jason, all wait. All are scared. Nobody talks. 
The SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS from on the top floor brings them to their feet. MANDELA'S DOCTOR descends the stairs. 
BARBARA What happened? 
DOCTOR It's simple exhaustion, but it'll lead to worse if it's not treated. He needs complete rest. And I don't mean just shifting the affairs of state to his bedroom. (MORE) 
DOCTOR (CONT'D) No phone calls, no visitors, no meetings. No politics. 
MARY You know him. He won't do that. 
DOCTOR Then I'm going to put him into hospital. In isolation. 
BARBARA No. Not yet. I'll threaten him with hospital if he doesn't behave. 
MARY I'll cancel everything. 
DOCTOR And I'll come back tonight to make sure he's not working. 
The doctor leaves. The rest of them look at each other, relieved ... and maybe a little guilty, for letting things get this bad. 
BARBARA (to Mary, aside) Don't cancel the trip to Taiwan. Not yet. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MANDELA'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Dark. Curtains drawn. The door opens quietly. A shaft of light from the door shows Mandela, on his back in bed, eyes closed. 
Barbara enters. The sight of Mandela lying like this is chilling. It is too close to what he would look like lying in a casket. 
Barbara makes sure he is breathing. He is. She unplugs his phone, takes it. Unplugs his TV. Sweeps the room for papers, articles, legal briefs. For the first time, she takes an arm load of stuff away from him. She gives Mandela one last, long look, closes the door behind her. 
We stay behind and look at Mandela, and ponder South Africa's fate if this were worse than just deep, sedated sleep. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. SPRINGBOK TRAINING FACILITY - DAY 
Chester Williams jogs under the tense eye of coach, trainer, manager and Pienaar. 
He accelerates, running fast, but not sprinting. 
COACH That's not good enough. 
Chester opens it up. Full sprint, sustained. Pienaar grins. Chester is back. 
COACH Let's hope the Samoans don't injure it again. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY 
ONE, BRIEF SHOT of a typically brutal Samoan tackle, and the ensuing foul play in the maul. 
CUT TO: 
FOUR QUICK SHOTS of Chester williams scoring four tries. 
CUT TO: 
ONE MORE SHOT of the Springboks trudging off the field. Every single player is bruised or bleeding, or both. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY 
Looking frail, but better than before, Mandela pencils in a score ON THE WORLD CUP BRACKET DIAGRAM: SOUTH AFRICA 42, WESTERN SAMOA 14. The diagram shows us that this was a quarter final match. 
We can see that he has entered all the South African scores. 
(For the record: South Africa 27 - Australia 18; South Africa 21 - Romania 3; South Africa 20 - Canada 0.) 
For the semi-finals, against South Africa, Mandela pencils in France. 
On the other side of the bracket, Mandela pencils in England vs. the All Blacks. 
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY 
Mandela watches at home with Barbara and Mary. 
MANDELA Let's do some work while we watch. 
Barbara resists her natural impulse to work and says: 
BARBARA Just enjoy the rugby. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY 
The sound of the match ON THE RADIO of one of the BMWs. Johan Lomu's name in every sentence. 
All the bodyguards are out of the cars, enjoying the winter sunshine as they listen to the match. 
KWEZI So, let me understand this. The All Blacks are killing a team that thrashed us last year? 
ETIENNE Thanks for reminding me. 
Hendrick opens the trunk of their BMW, pulls out a RUGBY BALL, shows it to Linga. 
Linga nods. Okay. Throw it. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUN CITY RESORT - DAY 
Another Lomu try, and a ripple goes through the Springboks. 
SPRINGBOK HOOKER We're going to have to tackle better than the English, that's for sure. 
PIENAAR We do. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY 
TV blares. Barbara does some work. Mandela comes and peeks over her shoulder -- 
MANDELA Are those the judicial appointments for the Free State? 
-- and Barbara shuts the file. 
BARBARA They'll keep until after the match. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY 
A pile of guns in holsters, on the hood of a BMW. Suit jackets draped over the side mirrors. 
In the wide street, in their shirts and ties, the boys toss the ball around. The white bodyguards handle the ball expertly, the black bodyguards for the first time in their lives. 
ETIENNE Give it a spin when you pass it. (DEMONSTRATING) Like this. 
Kwezi catches the ball, tries to throw it with spin, blows it. The ball bounces crazily all over the street, seems to have a mind of its own as it eludes Kwezi. 
They all laugh. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUN CITY RESORT - DAY 
Lomu scores his third try. 
SPRINGBOK WING How much does Lomu weigh? 
SPRINGBOK FLANK About 120 kilos. 
SPRINGBOK LOCK Shit, that's what I weigh. 
SPRINGBOK WING Ja, but at least you're slow. 
As we will discover, the wing is going to have to defend against Lomu. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY 
Mandela isn't watching TV. He's at the window, looking out at a GAME OF TOUCH RUGBY, taking place on the street outside his house. 
MANDELA Come and look at this. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY 
Two mixed teams. Hendrick passes to Linga, who passes back to Hendrick, who scores. 
HENDRICK (PANTING) You should've played rugby. 
LINGA (PANTING) They wouldn't let me carry my gun. 
Laughter. This scene was unthinkable a year ago. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY 
Barbara and Mary stand next to Mandela at the window. Mandela's eyes twinkle with pleasure as he hears the laughter. In a way, this small moment already justifies everything he has done. Almost. 
He gives Barbara a sly look. 
MANDELA Do you still think I'm wasting my time with the rugby? 
Before Barbara can reply, excitement on the TV makes Mandela turn away. He looks at the TV just as Lomu scores his fourth try, to make it 42 - 15. Mandela shakes his head, awed. 
MANDELA Barbara, can you please tell the Minister of Sport that I need a detailed briefing on the All Blacks. 
Barbara gives Mandela a long look. 
As in Cape Town, Pienaar stares out into the night, pensively. Preoccupied. 
So preoccupied, that when Nerine enters quietly, he hardly turns. 
NERINE I brought one of your mom's protein shakes. 
Pienaar nods, thanks. Nerine puts the protein shake down. She tries to read Pienaar's mood, see what he needs from her at this moment. 
NERINE Thinking about tomorrow? 
PIENAAR No, tomorrow's taken care of, one way or another. 
Pienaar turns to her. 
PIENAAR I'm thinking about how you spend 30 years in a tiny cell, but come out ready to forgive the people who put you there. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
We have seen that solitary shape under the blankets before. We have seen the clock on the bedside table change from 4:59 to 5:00 before. We have seen Mandela's eyes open, immediately. 
But we have never seen Mandela roll over and go back to sleep. 
SUPER: JUNE 24, 1995 - RUGBY WORLD CUP FINAL.

Linga gets out, meets Hendrick at the gate. 
LINGA Big day. 
HENDRICK Be an even bigger day if we actually won. 
Then, they both look at their watches again. 
HENDRICK Where is he? 
They share a worried look. Linga reaches for his radio. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MANDELA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Mandela's bedroom door is opened from outside the room. Light from the hallway hits the bed. Mandela looks very still under the covers. 
Mary peers in, concern wiping away sleep. She sees Mandela lying there. Mary tiptoes in, concern growing, until she stands over Mandela -- 
-- who opens his eyes without moving otherwise. 
MANDELA Can a man not sleep in, when he has a big day ahead of him? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Mary's voice on Linga's radio. 
LINGA (INTO RADIO) Okay, thanks. Out. 
Linga lowers his radio, embarrassed. 
LINGA He's sleeping in. 
HENDRICK Or was. 
Linga and Hendrick stand at the gate for a moment, then turn to head back to their respective cars. Linga pauses. 
LINGA I had an idea. About today. (BEAT) It's a crazy idea. 
HENDRICK Hey, don't worry, man. I already know you're crazy. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING 
Mandela eats breakfast -- porridge and fresh fruit -- and looks over the newspaper headlines, all screaming about today's World Cup final. 
The doorbell rings, and he pauses, listens to the sound of voices at the door -- then the sound of heavy footsteps approaching through the house. 
Mandela wipes his mouth and waits. Linga and Hendrick appear in the doorway. They look even bigger indoors. 
MANDELA Morning, boys. 
LINGA & HENDRICK Morning, Madiba. 
MANDELA What is it? 
Linga hesitates -- until Hendrick gives him a (for Hendrick) discreet nudge. 
HENDRICK Linga had an idea, sir.

EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY 
Stadium almost full. Crowd noise a dull roar. 
ABOVE THE SPRINGBOK BENCH, near the field, we find Nerine, Mr. and Mrs. Pienaar ... and Eunice, as they take their seats. Pienaar got the fourth ticket for her. 
Eunice turns to Mrs. Pienaar. 
EUNICE What's Mr. Francois doing now? 
CUT TO: 
INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY 
All dressed, all warmed up, the Springboks are quiet, introspective. Everything that should be said has been said. This is the calm before the storm. 
(NOTE that almost every player wears bandages, or braces, or is injured in some way.) 
Pienaar is not in the room. 
CUT TO: 
I/E ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY 
Dressed in his rugby togs, Pienaar sneaks up the ramp to the edge of the field, takes a peek out of the tunnel --

CO-PILOT Duly noted. 
The captain drops the nose of the 747 towards Ellis Park. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY 
Every seat full. Almost every seat filled by a big white man. Excitement unbearable. 
Jason stalks the runways between the seating sections, high in the stadium. Binoculars around his neck, radio in hand. 
Something catches his eye. Something in the air. Jason lifts his binoculars to his eyes. 
POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -- the 747 is heading right for the stadium. 
Jason lowers his binoculars. He frowns -- more puzzled than alarmed. (This is pre-9/11.) 
He lifts his radio to his mouth. 
JASON (INTO RADIO) Do you see that jet, to the east? 
CUT TO: 
Etienne, in another part of the stadium, looks eastwards -- sees it. 
ETIENNE (INTO RADIO) Did they get clearance for this? 
CUT TO: 
JASON (INTO RADIO) Not from us. 
The 747 gets closer, fast. 
Jason is hit by a horrible thought. 
JASON (INTO RADIO) Where is he? 
LINGA (ON RADIO) VIP BOX. 
Jason finds the VIP box, looks out at the 747 -- 
-- and realizes that the jet is heading straight at that side of the stadium. 
JASON (INTO RADIO) Get him out of there. Now. 
CUT TO: 
INT. VIP BOXES - ELLIS PARK - DAY 
Mandela is not in his seat. Linga turns. Hendrick points at the closed door of the VIP bathroom. 
LINGA (INTO RADIO) No time. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY 
Nothing Jason can do about it but hold his breath as -- 
SMASH CUT TO: 
Mandela emerges into daylight, wearing not a suit, not a Madiba shirt -- 
-- he is wearing Francois Pienaar's green and gold number 6 rugby jersey. 
On his head is THE SPRINGBOK CAP given to him by the team in CAPE TOWN 
The crowd catches its breath. This is unprecedented, shocking ... and brilliant. 
The Springboks digest this extraordinary display of support. 
SPRINGBOK HOOKER (murmuring to Pienaar) The All Blacks won't like that. 
Pienaar nods, eyes glinting. Mandela is giving them an edge. 
As he walks towards the waiting teams, Mandela lifts the Springbok cap high, waves it, and fires his famous, beautiful, huge, African smile at the crowd -- 
-- who roar and stand, slowly, and start chanting, slowly ... 
CROWD Nelson ... Nelson ... Nelson ... NELSON ... NELSON ... NELSON ... 
63 000 South Africans, chanting as one. 
CUT TO: 
A QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS 
ALL ACROSS SOUTH AFRICA, THE CHANT ECHOES through EMPTY STREETS. Not a soul, not a car to be seen. Everyone is inside, watching TV. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY 
CROWD ... NELSON ... NELSON ... NELSON ... etc. 
Mandela shakes hands with the Springboks, who are brimming with pride. Mandela shakes Chester Williams' hand with special energy. 
MANDELA I'm so glad you're here. 
Chester beams. 
CUT TO: 
IN THE STANDS, EUNICE ULULATES, loud African warrior woman call. Mr. Pienaar looks at her, shocked. Looks at her as a person for the first time, maybe. 
MR. PIENAAR DO THAT AGAIN! 
Eunice ululates again. 
CUT TO: 
ON THE FIELD, Mandela shakes hands with the All Blacks, who, as predicted, don't like his partisan clothing. Mandela looks up at Jonah Lomu. 
MANDELA Hello, Jonah. 
Lomu looks down at Mandela, eyes glowing with aggression -- 
-- and suddenly, he bares his tattooed Tongan tongue in a FIERCE WAR CRY. 
As do the rest of the All Blacks. 
WE HAVE SEGUED TO THE FAMOUS HAKA, a Maori war dance that tells an opponent they're going have their daughters stolen, their wives ravaged and their brains eaten right out of their skulls with a sharpened tea spoon. 
It is abundantly clear why, as the Minister of Sports told Mandela, half of the All Blacks matches are won before the whistle blows. 
This is very intimidating. 
Especially because, this day, the All Blacks push the haka closer and closer to the Springboks -- 
-- who do not back down. In fact, they close ranks and advance. 
Major, major international smackdown. This is not fake. The emotions, the aggression are real. 
ON MANDELA, whose diplomatic mask slips a little showing a warrior's glitter in his eyes. He wants to respond, primally. His fists clench at his side. 
The HAKA ENDS with a fearsome, guttural Maori yell. 
ON THE SPRINGBOKS, massed together, faces red with emotion, pulses racing. 
Mandela takes a deep breath in. 
Then the boys answer. 
With, of course, a terrorist anthem of their own: NKOSI SIKELEL' IAFRIKA. 
Pienaar starts it. 
PIENAAR NKOSI -- 
ALL SPRINGBOKS -- SIKELEL' IAFRIKA etc ... 
With decent pronunciation, with full fervor and heart, THE BOYS ROAR THE ANTHEM back at the All Blacks. 
The crowd joins them. "Nkosi" roars through the stadium, through the nation. 
ON MANDELA: his heart swells, as he sings with his people. 
CUT TO: 
ON JASON, who stands surrounded by his former enemies singing the song that kept him -- kept all of them -- going through the apartheid years. 
In this stadium, at this moment, all hostility, all fear, are a thing of the past. 
The tension finally goes out of Jason's shoulders. 
ON JASON'S FACE, close to tears, as NKOSI slowly fades. 
As Mandela said -- a very inspirational song. 
BEGIN HEARTBEAT OVER. Is that a heartbeat, or an African drum? 
CUT TO: 
ON THE FIELD, the All Black fly half tees up the ball, for kick off. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY 
Two sets of bruised, bleeding, exhausted, cramping men face each other for the extra time kick off. 
Pienaar turns to his men. 
PIENAAR Who's the fittest team on this field? 
The answer lies in their eyes: they are. 
An All Black penalty goal makes it 12 - 9 almost immediately. 
A Springbok penalty goal answers. 12 - 12. 
Seven minutes from the end of extra time, the Springboks earn a scrum deep in All Blacks territory. 
PIENAAR Keep it here. Run it forward. 
The scrum goes down, wheels a little. 
SPRINGBOK FLY HALF Francois! Pienaar turns his head. The fly half taps his own chest: give me the ball. 
Pienaar hesitates, then nods to the scrum half: give him the ball. 
The ball goes into the scrum. 
The ball works its way back through the feet of the eight Springbok forwards. 
The scrum half gathers it, spins it out to the fly half -- 
-- who takes one step to his left and KICKS A DROP GOAL high into the air. 
Ball soaring past a backdrop of open mouths. Higher than the uprights ... 
... but through them nonetheless. 
Springboks 15 - 12 All Blacks. 
An entire nation jumps to its feet. 
INT. VIP BOXES - ELLIS PARK - DAY 
Everyone is on their feet in the press box. 
MANDELA How long before the end? 
MINISTER OF SPORT Seven minutes. 
They turn out to be the longest seven minutes in Mandela's life. In every South African's life. 
BEGIN CLIMAX SEQUENCE: 
This is where we fold the Rainbow Nation into the rugby match, fully. 
INTERCUT BETWEEN PEOPLE ALL OVER SOUTH AFRICA, AND THE RUGBY as we show the whole nation wanting exactly the same thing at the same time. Faces, postures, eyes are identical, no matter where they are, who they are, what color they are. 
(It would be nice if we used all the faces we've already cut away to throughout this story.) 
ON THE FIELD 
The All Blacks attack desperately. The Springboks tackle and tackle and tackle. 
ON PIENAAR, totally spent but dragging himself to his feet for another tackle. 
He glances over at the referee, makes another tackle -- 
-- looks over at the referee -- 
-- the referee puts his hands on his whistle -- 
-- another tackle, another look -- 
-- the referee lifts the whistle to his lips -- 
-- another tackle, another look -- 
-- the REFEREE BLOWS THE FINAL WHISTLE. 
It's over. 
The Springboks have won. 
END CLIMAX SEQUENCE 
EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY 
Pandemonium on the field, pandemonium in the stands. 
Jason is hugged by an ecstatic boer (Jason is not a hugger). 
CUT TO: 
Mrs. Pienaar and Nerine are in tears. Mr. Pienaar hugs a shocked Eunice. 
INT. VIP BOXES - ELLIS PARK - DAY 
Pandemonium in the VIP box. Mandela shakes hands with everyone he can find. It is way too loud to say anything. 
Hendrick and Linga almost hug. Almost. They shake hands with total joy and engagement, whack each other on the shoulder. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. OUTSIDE ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY 
Sipho toi-tois next to the cop car (a township war dance, very political). The two cops toi-toi with him. 
CUT TO: 
AROUND THE NATION, an EPIDEMIC OF HUGGING begins. This spills out onto the streets later, but for now, let's restrict this to the people who've been watching the match together.

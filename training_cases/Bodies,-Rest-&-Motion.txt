FADE IN TITLE: ENFIELD, ARIZONA 
A brown Pinto pulls out of a parking lot and into rush hour traffic. 
INT. PINTO - DUSK 
BETH WALKER is driving. She looks younger, but she's twenty- eight. She has a strong face and flashing intelligent eyes. She's wearing a WAITRESS UNIFORM from Friendly's. She's deep in thought. 
Beth pulls up to stoplight and stops. 
SOUND: A gentle toot of car horn. 
Beth looks up, startled. 
BETH'S POV 
SID, a pleasant looking twenty-four year old, is in a pick- up truck next to her. He smiles and points up toward the traffic light. 
BETH 
She looks up toward the traffic light. 
TRAFFIC LIGHTS 
They're red except for one with a lit green arrow. 
BETH AND SID 
She pantomimes that she's in the wrong lane and wants to go straight. 
Sid pantomimes that he'll let her cut in front of him. 
SOUND: Horns honk impatiently. 
THE INTERSECTION 
Beth pulls away in front of the pick-up truck. The HONKING continues. Sid looks back at the honking car, cheerfully waves to it. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CAROL'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
A tiny well-kept Spanish style home in lower middle class residential section. 
INT. CAROL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
He pours himself a drink. Carol shuts the cabinet. 
NICK I know what's going to happen. 
Nick opens a cabinet under the sink and tosses the empty bottle in the trash. He begins to pace. Carol shuts the cabinet and follows him with her gaze. 
As Nick speaks, he gestures grandly with his drink, liquor splashing unnoticed over the sides. 
NICK (bursting with frustration) The same job, same scenery, same people... I've been in this town for years... Years!! 
CAROL (flatly) Three years. 
NICK (in despair) Oh, Carol... 
CAROL I know... 
He stops and slugs back his drink. 
NICK Forever -- it seems forever. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BETH'S PINTO - CONTINUOUS 
Beth pulls up to a stoplight, her face blank with thought. She's suddenly lit by the flash of headlights going on and off. She looks up and smiles. 
EXT. INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS 
Sid's pick-up truck is facing her across the intersection. It slowly pulls up beside her and stops. 
He smiles and gives a little wave of his hand. 
Without knowing why, she smiles and waves back. 
BETH (sweetly but firmly) Good-bye. 
She drives away. Sid stares after her. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAROL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Carol lifts the end metal ball on the thingabobby and releases it, starting the chain reaction. She stares at it clacking back and forth as she speaks. 
CAROL How long a drive is it? 
Nick paces. 
NICK Fourteen hours. 
CAROL That's not bad. 
NICK In a car? It's a fuckin' nightmare. 
Carol stops the metal ball. She releases two balls, starting a new chain reaction. 
NICK (griping) And there's no radio in Utah. It's all religious programs. 
CAROL Get saved. 
Nick slumps on the sofa beside her. 
NICK (flatly) No thanks. 
CAROL Hey. Think about this. You take a detour and go through Vegas -- you and Beth stop, see a show, have a nice romantic dinner -- play the slots, get the free drinks... 
NICK (interrupting) Too much money. The show. The meal. The slots. Then the hotel -- that's another hundred down the toilet. 
As Carol speaks she pokes at Nick. He fends off her blows. By the end of her speech she is on top of him mock-strangling him. 
CAROL (jabbing Nick) No, you skip the hotel. It's night, the highway's empty -- you can make good time. You start speeding. You get stopped in Utah by the cops -- you flunk the breathalizer, they haul you in. The judge is Mormon -- you get fifteen years, you go to prison, but at least your life has taken a direction! 
Nick and Carol collapse into laughter. The front door opens. 
BETH (calling in) I'm here! 
Beth steps in. Carol quickly lets go of Nick's neck and gets off him. 
NICK AND CAROL 
NICK Then what is it? 
She pulls away from him and starts walking to the house next door. He falls into step with her. 
BETH (uncomfortably) I, umm... I... It embarrasses me. When you talk about something with Carol that happened before me. She's my best friend. It embarrasses me that you used to live with her. 
NICK That was years ago. 
BETH Three years. 
NICK That's right. 
BETH I know... 
NICK And we're moving. She won't be your best friend anymore. 
They arrive at their front door. Beth takes out her keys. Nick stops her hand and kisses her. She kisses him back. 
NICK Living with someone isn't such a big deal. 
She nods and looks to the lock. 
NICK Anyway... I live with you now. 
Beth looks to Nick. He stares out at the night. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE-UP: COFFEE-MAKER 
The coffee-maker clock hits nine o'clock. The coffee maker clicks on with a rattle. Steam starts to spew out. 
The coffee-maker makes horrible gurgling sounds. 
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
The kitchen is small and a little grimy, its furnishings fatigued. 
Nick stares at the coffee-maker in disbelief. He's dressed in a dress shirt, untied necktie, and slacks. He's carrying a sportscoat with a Sears' employee name-tag attached. 
NICK (calling out) Beth!... Beth!! 
Beth walks into the kitchen, wearing a robe and carrying the paper. 
Nick points accusingly at the coffee maker as water pours down from around its top. 
NICK It's... it's raining! 
BETH It does that. 
She drops the paper on the kitchen table and gets a mug off the counter. 
NICK Since we got it? 
BETH No. (pouring herself a cup) Lately. 
NICK (throwing his jacket on a chair) Shit. (agitated) What's wrong with it? 
BETH Water comes out. 
NICK Shit. (unplugging the coffee maker) I hate this shit! It never kept the coffee hot. And now this. 
He angrily wraps the cord around the coffee-maker. 
BETH (blowing on her coffee) It still works. 
NICK (adamant) No. It doesn't. Water comes out. 
BETH Okay. 
She sips her coffee. She flips open a box of Dunkin' Donuts. 
NICK I could've gotten a new one. On my discount. Now it's too late. 
BETH Do you want a donut? 
NICK (exasperated) No. I want an appliance that works. 
Beth shrugs and takes a donut out of the box. She leans against the counter, eating the donut. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - MORNING 
About hundred cars dot the vast parking lot. 
Nick swings into a parking spot and gets out of the car. He tosses his jacket on the roof and crouches, tieing his necktie using the car's outside mirror. 
MAN'S VOICE You livin' in your car or what? 
NICK'S POV - IN THE MIRROR 
CHIP, a big redheaded guy in his late thirties, wearing a jacket and tie, is grinning at the crouched Nick. Nick's reflection grins back. 
NICK Just waiting for the last second to put on the noose. (tightening the tie) So Chip -- what's new? 
NICK AND CHIP 
Nick straightens up and grabs his jacket. They start walking toward the mall. 
CHIP Nothing much. (broaching the subject) I heard you're leaving. 
NICK Yeah. I'm outta here. 
They approach the employees entrance. 
CHIP They can you? 
NICK That's what they think. 
CHIP Yeah? 
NICK I was gonna quit anyway -- this way I get unemployment. 
CHIP Good deal. 
Nick opens the door. 
NICK Yeah... recession insurance... (Chip enters) This way I'm not stuck waiting around for the lay-offs to start. 
Nick follows Chip in. 
CHIP (a hint of panic) Lay-offs? 
The door shuts behind him. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE-UP - NEWSPAPER 
The front page of the Phoenix Sun-Times -- the headline reads "Misery Index Soars". 
Beth's hand comes INTO FRAME and crumples the page. 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
Beth stuffs the paper in a glass and wraps the glass in another piece. She's sitting on the floor, surrounded by dishes, newspaper, and cardboard liquor boxes. She adds the wrapped glass to a box. 
She hears the SOUND of a CAR DOOR SLAMMING, looks up, then returns to her packing. She reaches behind herself into the trash, pulls out the blender, and begins to wrap it. 
At the SOUND of the FRONT DOOR opening, followed by a curious METALLIC CLUNKING, she stands and hurries through the swinging door to the living room. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The living room is sparsely furnished -- a sofa, a coffee table, a bookcase cluttered with a handful of paperbooks, a couple of boardgames, a dying cactus, etc. A crappy old fifteen inch t.v. on a t.v. tray. WE SEE this for a moment before... 
A paint-splattered cloth is unfurled FILLING THE SCREEN. 
It gently floats down, revealing a PAINTER and his shopping cart overloaded with supplies. He's dressed in paint- splattered clothes. A paint-splattered Red Sox cap is pulled low over his eyes, obscuring his face. 
Beth stares in disbelief. Without seeing her, the painter backs up, his attention focused on spreading the dropcloth. 
BETH Who are you? 
SID (not looking up) The painter. 
BETH (agitated) What are you doing? 
SID Painting. 
SID Now if it was my house, I would choose a color... 
Beth kneels down, holding the tape, as he arrives at her end of the wall. 
SID I would not choose off-white. 
Beth holds out the tape. They are kneeling next to each other. 
BETH What would you choose? 
SID The color of your eyes. (pause, without looking) Hazel. 
Beth stares at Sid. Sid looks to Beth. Smiling, he takes the tape from her fingers. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PIZZA HUT - AFTERNOON 
An oasis in the center of a packed mall parking lot. Carol hurries toward the front entrance in a snappy skirt and blazer combo, a Bullock's name tag attached to her lapel. 
INT. PIZZA HUT - CONTINUOUS 
Nick is sitting at a booth, a beer in front of him, lost in thought. 
Carol arrives, drops a gift-wrapped box on the table, and scoots into the booth. 
CAROL Sorry I'm late, the new girl's a moron. 
NICK (looking to the present) What's that? 
CAROL Going away present. 
Nick takes it. 
NICK Thanks. 
He quickly unwraps it. 
NICK (happily) A map! 
CAROL I thought you might need it. 
NICK (unfolding it) I do! I had a map -- I lost it. 
He spreads the map out over the table. 
CAROL (organized) Let's highlight your route. 
A MAP 
of the Western half of the U.S.A. fills the FRAME. Carol's hand, holding a bright red felt-tip pen, ENTERS FRAME. 
CAROL (O.S.) Here's Enfield. 
She circles it. Nick's finger ENTERS FRAME. 
NICK (O.S.) Here's Billings. 
Carol circles Billings. Nick's finger starts to trace the route. 
Carol's pen follows, marking the route. Halfway to Billings, Nick's finger abruptly stops. Carol stops the pen at the same point. 
NICK (O.S.) Look at this -- right there -- that's the town I was born in. 
NICK AND CAROL 
He looks to her for a reaction. 
NICK (emphatically) Where I grew up. Where my parent's live... Isn't that a coincidence? 
CAROL Visit them. 
NICK (shaking his head) Oh... no... 
CAROL You're going to be driving by. 
NICK No... (shaking his head) They're not near the interstate. (sort of chagrined) I haven't even called them in years. 
CAROL You might as well visit. 
SID (smiling) I guess he'd be the "they". 
BETH He'd find us. And he'd be surprised. 
Sid gets off the bed and with a grin, gingerly pats out the wrinkles he's made in the bed spread. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON 
Nick and Carol are walking away from the Pizza Hut, across a huge parking lot, toward a large mall. Cars circle past them, searching for close spots. 
NICK (doggedly) It was the drive that killed us. San Antonio to Seattle is just too many hours in a car. If we'd have flown, we would've made it. 
CAROL (shaking her head) No... 
NICK Things were all right in bed. 
CAROL But the rest of the time they were... awful. 
NICK (hurt) Really? 
CAROL (flatly) Nick. We couldn't stand each other. We stopped in Enfield and just stayed. 
NICK (after a beat) Why didn't you go on to Seattle? It was your car. 
Carol stops. On her face, the answer to his question is clear -- she was stuck on Nick then and she's still stuck on him now. 
But she'd never let him know that. 
CAROL (dryly) Big trees scare me. 
She starts walking. Nick hurries up beside her. They walk side by side for a few paces before the shotdown Nick comes up with a new ploy to win favor. 
NICK (casually) I'm thinking about stealing a t.v. 
CUT TO: 
INT. NICK AND BETH'S BEDROOM HALLWAY - AFTERNOON 
Beth's taking extra sheets and towels from the linen closet and packing them in liquor boxes. 
Sid enters from the living room. 
SID (cheerfully) I'm done in there. I won't paint the ceiling 'til you've moved the furniture out. 
BETH I don't think we're going to take much of the furniture. 
SID No? 
BETH It's ugly. 
SID I kind of like the sofa. 
BETH It's a sofa bed. 
SID You're not going to take it? 
BETH (flatly) It weighs two thousand pounds. 
SID Can I have it? 
BETH It's yours. 
SID Excellent. 
INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The furniture is kind of ugly, but the walls look great. The whole room seems brighter, almost magically more cheerful. 
Sid runs into the room and flops onto the sofa. He settles in and sighs contentedly. 
The front door BURSTS open. Sid leaps up. 
Carol races into the room. 
CAROL (excited) Nick's gonna steal a t.v.! 
She sees Sid and freezes. 
RORY I do. 
NICK (laying it out) You see... you go to a movie, you're there. 
Rory listens attentively. 
NICK You watch t.v., you're thirteen places at once. As many channels as you get, that's as many places as you are. You get cable? You're forty places at once. You get a satellite dish?... 
RORY You're all over the world. 
NICK Exactly. 
In the BACKGROUND, on the big screen t.v., the soap actress breaks the embrace and points a gun at the actor. 
NICK You're everywhere. 
The soap actress shoots the actor. He stares at her in overacting disbelief and slumps to the floor. 
NICK It's called freedom. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Carol watches as Sid whistles cheerfully, ripping the long strips of masking tape off the trim. 
CAROL (w/ attitude) This is what you do? 
SID I also mow lawns. 
CAROL Which is your career? 
SID Painting. I'm an inside person. (confidentially) Mowing grass is seasonal. 
CAROL (dryly) That is true. 
Sid wads the tape into a big ball. 
SID (disarmingly) You've got a nice tan. 
CAROL (not disarmed) I work on it. 
Sid shoots the tape ball into his shopping cart of supplies. 
SID Do you want to get stoned? 
Carol thinks for a moment. It's been a long time and she's not crazy about him being there. 
CAROL (after a beat) Yeah. 
Sid takes a joint out of his shirt pocket. 
SID This kind of painting -- for people I won't know -- it's boring. (lighting the joint) It's not very good. It's homegrown. 
He takes a drag. 
CAROL Yeah? 
SID But it'll get you fucked up. 
He hands the joint to Carol. 
CAROL 
takes a drag on the joint like an old pro. 
SID (O.S.) It'll take you someplace. 
Carol chokes back wheezes and then explodes in a coughing fit. 
CUT TO: 
INT. APPLIANCE CENTER - LATER 
Nick and MAJOR JENKINS, a uniformed military man in his late forties, are standing in front of a wall of silent color televisions. On the t.v.s a nearly identical pairs of LOCAL ANCHORS smile their way through the news. 
NICK Have you thought about American? 
MAJOR JENKINS No. 
NICK (interrupting, pleasantly) Miss... I'm helping this customer here, perhaps you might... (firmly, a salesman's put-off) You might want to see someone else. 
BETH (pointedly) You can't help me? 
NICK (after a beat, then w/ finality) Not really. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SEARS - CONTINUOUS 
Beth rides down on the escalator, the receipt clenched in her hand, surrounded by other shoppers, as a tinny Muzak version of the "Theme from The Mary Tyler Moore Show" drones on in the background. 
Conflicting emotions cloud her face. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE-UP - A HUGE T.V. BOX 
SID (O.S.) How'd you do it? 
BETH (O.S.) Nick sold a demo, wrote it up like a new set, and gave me the receipt. 
As Sid's jacknife ENTERS FRAME and zips through the packing tape, THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal... 
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The sun is low, giving the room a golden glow. 
Sid and Beth are sitting on the sofa, the t.v. box on the floor in front of them. 
Sid opens the television box. Slowly, he pulls out the sheets of bubbled packing plastic. He pops several of the bubbles. 
SID (savoring the bubble plastic) Excellent. 
BETH Maybe I should just leave it packed... 
SID C'mon! You stole it. You gotta see it! Hold the box. 
Beth holds the box. Sid starts to lift out the television. 
SID (urgently) Wait! 
Beth looks to him, anxiously. 
SID I thought I heard the police. 
Beth listens, nervously. Sid grins. 
BETH Ha ha ha. (an amused realization) You're stoned! 
SID (innocently) Me? 
BETH You're being silly and you've got bunny eyes. 
Embarrassed, Sid pulls Visine from a pocket and drips it in his eyes as he speaks. 
SID I'm a little stoned... not that stoned. 
BETH No? 
SID No. (after a beat) Carol's really stoned. 
BETH You got Carol stoned? 
SID Very stoned. 
BETH I didn't think she liked you. 
SID She doesn't. But she likes getting stoned. 
BETH (smiling) She does. 
SID There's nothing like drugs to create a quick and shallow friendship. 
Beth laughs. 
SID (rubbing his hands) Let's look at the loot. 
Sid pulls the t.v. up and out of the box. He sits back on the sofa, the t.v. in his lap. 
Beth turns off the t.v. There's a moment of awkward silence as they all stare at the blank screen. 
CAROL (breaking the silence, pointedly) How's the painting going? 
SID (shaking his head) Too many distractions. I'll be at it all night. 
CAROL You have bad work habits. 
SID Not when I'm actually working. (standing) I better get set up in the kitchen. 
He goes to his shopping cart of supplies. Carol and Beth stare at the television. 
The television stares back at them, gleamingly modern. 
CAROL It makes teevee seem very futuristic. 
SID (at the kitchen door) That's 'cause you're stoned. 
CAROL I'm hardly stoned. 
She looks to Beth. Beth is grinning. 
CAROL (mitigating) It was homegrown. 
BETH (teasing) Want some Visine? 
CAROL (flatly) No. 
SID (O.S.) (calling out) It gets the red out. 
The Visine comes flying INTO FRAME. Carol fumbles, then catches it. 
CAROL (dryly) Thank you. 
Carol tilts back her head and manuevers the Visine. 
CAROL Shit. Missed the eye, got the face. 
BETH Need help? 
CAROL Yeah. 
Beth goes to her and takes the Visine. 
BETH Okay. (holding Carol's arm) Tilt your head back. 
CAROL Beth... 
BETH Stop fidgeting. 
She puts a drop in one eye. Carol flinches. 
CAROL Got it. 
BETH Next eye. 
CAROL Wait a second. 
Carol blinks and wipes a Visine tear off her cheek. 
CAROL (nodding to the kitchen, in a conspiratorial whisper) He really wants to get in your pants. 
BETH (smiling) My pants are taken. 
She tilts Carol's head back. 
BETH Why don't you go for him? 
CAROL He likes you. 
Beth puts a drop in Carol's eye. Carol flinches and rubs her eye. 
BETH I wish Nick would get back and help with the packing. 
She sighs, cheerfully exasperated. 
BETH He's probably getting drunk with the stockboys... (after a beat) That's what he's probably doing. 
Carol braces herself. 
Nick stares out at the moonlit desert and the mountains rising in the distance. 
NICK So what does the wind mean? Like as an omen or something, you know -- (making his voice mystical) -- a change is coming to the people. -- the spirit of freedom is walking the land. (flatly) That kind of meaning... 
NAVAJO TEEN (handing him money) Fourteen, fifteen and five makes twenty. 
He opens Nick's car door for him. 
NAVAJO TEEN The wind is. It's the wind like I'm a Navajo. 
NICK That's it? 
The Navajo teen nods. 
NICK Shit. 
He gets in the car, his mood darkening, and pulls his door shut with a slam. 
NICK (out the window) It would be better if meant something. 
The Navajo teen shrugs. Nick starts the engine. 
CUT TO: 
INT. A BAR IN ENFIELD - NIGHT 
A dimly lit room filled with raucous customers and lots of neon beer signs. Waitresses in red dresses tote pitchers of brew to the thirsty throng. At the far end a band plays a foot-stompin' good time tune about a trucker on his way to see his woman. 
THE CAMERA MOVES through the crowd and discovers Carol and Beth sitting at a small table, an almost finished pitcher of beer between them. 
They speak loudly to be heard over the din. 
CAROL He said he needs to be alone again. Learn about himself. Make a fresh start in a new town. 
Beth shakes her head then takes a sip of her beer -- it tastes bitter in her mouth and she puts her glass down in disgust. 
CAROL (after a beat) He's sorry. 
Beth stares at her beer. Carol puts a hand comfortingly on Beth's arm. 
CAROL He said he would have called you, but your phone's disconnected. 'Cause you're moving. (after a beat) He's always been an asshole. (after a beat) You'll be all right. 
BETH Yeah... 
CAROL (gently) I'm here. 
BETH I know that. 
A big-haired WAITRESS approaches the table. 
WAITRESS You ready for another? 
Carol looks to Beth. 
BETH Oh... uh, no... 
CAROL We're fine. 
WAITRESS Is Nick coming in? 
Carol throws the waitress a look that could kill. Beth takes a deep breath. 
CUT TO: 
INT./EXT. NICK'S SEDAN - HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
Nick stares at the road ahead. He takes rapid drags on a cigarette. The RADIO is barely audible over the ROAR of the WIND through the open windows. 
PREACHER'S VOICE (covered by static) "And he arose and came to his father, but when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and..." 
Nick turns the radio off. 
He fumbles the cigarette into the ashtray. 
He takes a pint of scotch from the front seat, uncaps it, takes a slug, takes another slug, recaps it, and drops it back on the seat. 
He stares at the road. He looks down to the front seat and finds the map. He splits his attention between the road and unfolding the map. The wind catches the map. 
The map billows up, covering his face. Losing control of the car, Nick slaps it down. 
Beth smiles weakly. Abruptly, she drops her donut back in the box. 
SID (cautiously) Are you all right? 
BETH (apologetically) Must be the paint fumes... 
She opens up the back door and steps out. Sid stares at the empty doorway. 
EXT. BACK STOOP - CONTINUOUS 
Beth stands in the moonlight, staring out at the stars. 
BETH (contemplatively dubious) You find what you want here? 
Sid steps out behind her. 
SID It seems that way. 
BETH Yeah? 
SID (simply) I found you. 
BETH Oh. No... 
She walks out into the backyard. Sid follows her. 
SID (earnestly) We never met before last night... 
The moonlight through the orange trees casts a magical air about the backyard. Beth stops by a swingset. 
SID ...but we know each other. 
Beth stiffens. 
BETH No... 
She walks away from him. He watches her intently. 
SID Leave it behind. 
She looks to him. 
BETH Leave what behind? 
SID Unhappiness. 
BETH (amused) That was a bad answer. 
SID (seriously) No. It was true. 
Beth stares at Sid. 
BETH It's not. 
SID Come hold me. (after a beat) Come hold me, and you'll be happy. 
BETH (dryly) I'll find happiness. Right. In your arms. 
SID Yes. 
BETH In you. 
SID Yes. 
BETH But I won't. I have to find happiness in myself. 
SID No. That's wrong. (going toward her) People tell you that, but it's wrong. 
She turns away from him. He stands behind her, close. 
SID I've lived with people who have that happiness from within. That happiness -- it's just them being pleased with themselves. It's not enough. It's a lonely thing. 
She turns and faces him. The moonlight casts a pale glow over them. 
She stares in his eyes for a long moment. She steps back from him. 
BETH You're showing how young you are. 
SID No. I'm not. I'm showing you a way. You know that. And you know me. (after a beat) And I know you. 
NICK Nice to meet you. 
He holds out a hand to Mr. August, who slowly shakes it. 
ELIZABETH He's deaf. 
NICK (loudly) Nice to meet you. 
ELIZABETH He's stone deaf. 
NICK Oh. (uncomfortably) Yelling doesn't help. 
ELIZABETH No. 
Nick breaks the handshake. Mr. August smiles at him. Nick looks to Elizabeth. 
NICK My name is Nick, Nick Brennan. 
He waits for her to introduce herself. She doesn't. 
NICK Did you know the Brennans? 
ELIZABETH No. 
NICK They lived here. They used to live here. I used to live here with them... 
Elizabeth stares at him. Nick tries his salesman charm. 
NICK What's your name? 
ELIZABETH Elizabeth. 
NICK No... 
ELIZABETH Yes. 
NICK I know an Elizabeth. (quietly) I call her Beth. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BETH'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Bathed in moonlight, Sid and Beth make tender passionate love. 
Sid has never wanted someone so much and Beth has never felt so wanted. 
Beth clings to Sid as if she were afraid of being swept away... and then she is. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. MR. AUGUST'S DINING ROOM - LATER 
A chandelier casts a gently sparkling golden glow. 
The CAMERA TILTS down to reveal... 
Mr. August, Elizabeth and Nick, sitting at a large antique dining room table. 
Nick is eating a sandwich, an untouched glass of milk in front of him. Mr. August and Elizabeth watch him, expectantly. Nick notices this. 
NICK (swallowing) This is a good sandwich. 
ELIZABETH Thank you. 
NICK (abruptly nodding toward Mr. August) When did he move here? Would he know where the people before him went? 
ELIZABETH No. He wouldn't remember. 
NICK You're sure? 
ELIZABETH Yes. He doesn't remember anymore. 
NICK Oh. (taking a deep breath) He can't help me. 
ELIZABETH No. 
Nick looks around the familiar room, struck by the absurdity of the situation. 
NICK (with wry awareness) I've lost my parents. 
Suddenly she realizes it's not Nick. She pulls away, orientating herself. She quickly scoots out of bed and hurriedly pulls on a pair of jeans. 
The alarm clock CLANGS. 
Beth looks about for the alarm. She tensely scatters some boxes. She dumps one, finds the alarm and shuts it off. She stares at the clock and drops it into a box. 
SID (O.S.) (cheerfully) Morning. 
Beth cringes slightly and turns to face Sid. 
SID AND BETH 
BETH (attempting a smile) Hi. 
SID (grinning) Hi. 
BETH I didn't want to wake you. 
SID (cheerfully) I'm awake. I'm a morning person. 
BETH I'm not. 
SID Then why don't you come back to bed? 
BETH I've got to pack. 
SID (sitting up) Where do we start? 
BETH (firmly) No. (softening) You paint. 
She looks around the room littered with boxes and piles of clothes. 
BETH I'll manage. 
SID (cheerfully) Whatever you say. 
Sid gets out of bed, wrapping the sheet around himself. Beth stares at the room. She suddenly trembles. She steadies herself on the bed table. 
BETH Oh God... 
SID (concerned) What? 
Beth avoids his eyes, glancing around the room. 
BETH (an outpouring) I'd be so much happier if I could blame this on Nick, but it always happens to me. I'm always left with nothing. (taking a deep breath) It doesn't matter if I leave the guy or if the guy leaves me -- I'm left with nothing. I never do anything for myself. I never acquire anything. I mean Nick didn't take from me. He stole a t.v. and left it for me. He didn't take my things, he didn't take our things... he didn't even take his clothes! And I'll still leave this house with nothing! 
SID He took three years from you. 
BETH No... (meeting his eyes) He didn't take 'em. I mean, when he cared about me, he cared about me. And he was really good in bed. 
She glances away from Sid toward the bed. 
BETH (after a beat) I didn't expect more. 
She turns away from Sid and the bed. Sid moves toward her. 
SID (carefully) Beth... 
Beth summons up all the composure she can manage. 
BETH (referring to the cluttered room) I can't face this. (looking to Sid) I'm gonna finish up the kitchen... (heading for the door) ...get some momentum... 
She goes out the bedroom door. Sid stares after her.

EXT. ABANDONED REST STOP - MORNING 
Nick's sedan is parked in the same place as the night before. 
A YOUNG MAN with long hair ROARS into the rest stop on a Harley-Davidson, his life's possession strapped on the back. 
He stops the bike between Nick's car and the phonebooth, idling the engine, loudly. He looks to the phonebooth, the receiver dangling. He turns to Nick's sedan. 
YOUNG MAN Phone work? 
NICK 
Awakened by the ROAR, Nick has wearily leaned his head out the window. 
CAROL Let's do things, get you busy. 
BETH Yeah. 
CAROL You get all the stuff you wanna sell, and I'll make some tag sale signs. 
BETH No one'll buy my stuff. It's all junk. 
CAROL That's what people buy at tag sales. Broken appliances, ugly knicknacks. 
Beth looks at the semi-packed boxes. 
BETH (laughing) I guess I do have stuff to sell. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BETH'S FRONT LAWN - DAY 
Boxes full of a motley collection of knickknacks, housewares, and crummy appliances are spread out on the lawn. 
In the BACKGROUND a couple of M.T.V. influenced teens are checking out the knickknacks and goofing on them. 
MRS. DOTSON, a woman in her late forties wearing a NURSE'S UNIFORM is poking through the odds and ends. 
Beth and Carol hovering near her. 
Mrs. Dotson picks up the coffee maker, examines it, and puts it down. She picks up the blender, examines it, and puts it down. 
CAROL (impatiently) Is there something specific you're looking for? 
MRS. DOTSON Yes. (sheepishly) Actually everything... I don't have anything. 
BETH Nothing? 
MRS. DOTSON I just moved to town. (hesitating then confiding) My husband passed away, and I, umm, didn't want to have our things... they were too familiar. 
Beth realizes why she's selling all her stuff -- it's too familiar. 
BETH (abruptly) You can have it all for three hundred. The stuff in these boxes and everything inside. 
MRS. DOTSON (taken aback) Oh, my, I don't know... everything? 
BETH Everything. (hesitating) Except the t.v. 
Mrs. Dotson searches Beth's face with a kind gaze. Beth smiles nervously. 
BETH (apologetically) The t.v.s not for sale. 
CUT TO: 
INT/EXT. NICK'S SEDAN 
Nick's smoking, looking haggard. Between drags, he anxiously taps a tempo on the steering wheel with his cigarette holding hand. 
NICK'S POV 
The highway and the desert stretch out before him, the heat waves of late afternoon shimmering above the blacktop. 
In the distance, the giant teepee souvenir shop rises out of the horizon like a mirage. 
NICK 
An idea strikes him and his lips tighten into a small determined smile. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TEEPEE GIFT SHOP - AFTERNOON 
A couple of vacationing families and a busload of elderly sightseers poke through the stunning assortment of Native American souvenirs. 
Nick stands at the counter talking to a plump elderly NAVAJO WOMAN. 
NAVAJO WOMAN Maybe some nice turquoise jewelry. 
NICK (shaking his head) I don't think she really wears jewelry. 
A little boy stares at the disheveled Nick. His mother hurries him away. 
NAVAJO WOMAN Maybe a nice Navajo rug? 
BETH (shaking her head) I can't. (after a beat, admitting her feelings) He gets to me... too much. If I don't go I'll end up with staying with him. 
CAROL (gently) You've done worse. 
BETH Sure. 
They look at each other and start to laugh. Their laughter builds -- a release of the strain of the last two days. 
CUT TO: 
INT. NICK'S SEDAN - INTERSTATE - DAY 
Nick's driving fast, completely focused on the road ahead, the wind ROARING through the open windows. 
A cheap plastic Indian headdress with brightly colored synthetic feathers is perched on his head. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Sid's finished painting -- the room gleams. He pulls a dropcloth off the bureau, then another one off of Beth's two packed suitcases. 
BETH (O.S.) (softly) Sid? 
Sid turns and looks, smiling. 
SID'S POV 
Beth is standing in the doorway, a weariness having settled over her. She steps into the room. 
BETH AND SID 
SID Hi. 
BETH I'm sorry about selling the sofa bed. 
SID I didn't really need one. When my friends get drunk, they throw up and sleep on the floor. 
BETH But I gave it to you. 
He puts his arms around her. 
SID You gave me a lot more. 
BETH No. (holding him tightly) It was all even in this department. 
SID (softly) ...Feel me? 
BETH (whispering) I know... You're hard again. 
Holding her tightly, Sid runs his fingers down her spine. 
SID I want you all the time. 
BETH (torn) Shit. 
She kisses him. They kiss, long and hard. Abruptly, she breaks the embrace and moves away from him. 
BETH (ironically self-aware) I just fleeced a widow. 
SID (protesting) No... 
BETH It was all junk. 
She shivers. 
BETH Shit. I've got to get some aspirin... (shaking her head) I didn't drink enough to be hung over. 
She walks away from Sid, out of the bedroom. 
INT. BETH'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Beth gulps down aspirin. She stares at herself in the mirror, wearily searching. 
IN THE MIRROR 
Sid appears in the doorway, his reflection small next to the reflection of her face. 
SID You just feel bad for her like I feel bad for her... 'cause her husband died. 
BETH It's been passionate, it's been comfortable. But it hasn't been... important. (after a beat) Like you're making it! 
SID (urgently) It is important! You know that. 
BETH No! It was a night! It wasn't real. It was fun, it was some great fucking! But it's just something that happened! It's not real! 
SID It didn't "just happen"! You know we're it! I'm the one for you! 
BETH The "one"?! I've had lots of "ones"! I look like a baby but I'm twenty- fuckin'-- eight years old! You're just the latest! 
SID No. I'm the last. You've found me. And it can go on forever. 
BETH No! (her heart breaking for him) Oh, Sid... Forever? (shaking her head) You have to understand -- it's just talk. 
SID It's not. 
BETH (defiantly disbelieving) It is. C'mon, these things you say... c'mon! What?! If I died you couldn't stand life? That's... that's... 
SID That's true. 
BETH No. 
Beth can't bear the risk of opening her soul to believe him -- and she can't bear to hear the outpouring of his soul without believing him. So she ends it. 
BETH (after a beat, harshly) You won't know when I die. You won't be there. 
She picks up her suitcases and heads for the door. 
SID (following her, certain) You'd want me there. If I wasn't there it wouldn't matter who was. You'd be alone. 
BETH No. 
He grabs her arms and spins her to face him. 
SID (imploring) Beth... Beth... you love me... 
BETH (defiantly) No! 
SID How do you feel? Think! You love me. 
She stares at him, breathing deeply, gathering herself. He lets go of her arms and steps back. 
BETH (her words carefully chosen) I care about you. 
SID You have to be with me. 
BETH No. (pause) I care about you. But I'm an adult. I can say no. 
They stare at each other. 
SID (w/ controlled anger) That's what makes you an adult? 
BETH (unwavering) Yes. (pause) I can say no. (pause) No, I won't do that. No, I won't have that. No, I can't. 
SID (needing to hear her say it) You can say no to me? 
BETH Yes. 
He looks away from her. She stares at his back. 
BETH I'm going. 
She steps toward the door. 
SID Beth! 
She stops. 
SID (after a beat) Have someplace to go. 
BETH (simply) I don't. 
She opens the door. 
SID Why don't... 
BETH (interrupting) Don't tell me what to do. 
She goes out the door. Sid goes to the door. 
NICK No... 
Nick and Carol look to each other, at a loss. Nick looks back to the couple. 
NICK (improvising) We're your new neighbors. From next door. 
Carol throws him a look. 
MAN Well. (putting on a good face) It's nice to meet you. 
He holds out his hand to shake. After an instant of awkward hesitation they all shake hands with too much enthusiasm. 
WOMAN (cheerfully, while shaking hands) It is... and it's so nice of you to greet us. 
CAROL Thank you. 
They finish the handshakes -- there's an awkward pause. 
NICK Actually, we're here for the t.v. 
He waits, half expecting this statement to be challenged. It isn't. 
NICK (confidently) The people who left here -- our old neighbors -- left us that t.v. 
They all look at the t.v. 
MAN Oh. It's very nice. 
CAROL Yes. It is. 
There's an awkward pause. 
CAROL (going to the t.v.) Well, dear... we should carry it home. 
Nick and Carol lift the t.v. 
WOMAN Do you need help? 
NICK We can manage. 
They move toward the front door, Carol going backwards. 
CAROL Thanks anyway. 
Nick looks to make eye contact with Carol. He can't. She's looking back over her shoulder for obstacles. He smiles and glances toward the couple. 
Nick and Carol go out the door, lugging the t.v. 
WOMAN (calling out) Nice meeting you. 
The man and woman look at each other. They look around the room. 
MAN They're not done painting. 
WOMAN They'll finish. 
She stares out the front door. 
WOMAN (whimsically) I wonder where our furniture is? 
She looks back to him. He's staring at the ceiling. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE LAWN - CONTINUOUS 
They're lugging the t.v. across to Carol's -- Carol backing up and Nick going forward. They arrive at the front door. 
Nick takes most of the weight of the t.v., while Carol fumbles with her key into her front door lock with her free hand. 
CAROL You're not going to be their new neighbor. 
NICK It was just something to say. 
Carol gets the door open. 
CAROL Good. 
Carol backs into the house, leading the way.

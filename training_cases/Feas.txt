The title SHATTERS... 
INT. CRASHED CAR -- NIGHT 
P.O.V. - We frantically EMERGE from the burning wreck... RUN from the crash over desolate prairie land... 
EXT. BAR -- NIGHT 
Neon light flashes UNITED NATIONS TAVERN. Laughing and music emanates. Besides the bar, there's nothing around for miles. 
A 1985, pristine black Pontiac Trans-Am with a Golden Eagle on the hood pulls up. The rear bumper sticker reads "MY OTHER TOY HAS TITS." 
A weasel-like man with a fat belly and tank-top emerges from the hot rod carrying a VELVET POOL CUE CASE. Freeze on him. 
NAME: BOZO AGE: 32 JOB: UNEMPLOYED OCCUPATION: TOWN JACKASS LIFE EXPECTANCY: DEAD BY DAWN 
The rest of the parking lot is scattered with cars and pickup trucks. Bozo lazily makes his way to the bar and pushes through the front entrance -- 
INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS 
Bozo passes a man dressed in a cheap suit and standing well over six foot five with frazzled black hair and olive skin. 
Talking with a thick Greek accent, he pleads into a pay phone. 
COACH (into pay phone) They took my laptop with my PowerPoint presentation, my Blackberry, my cell... And to top it off, my car crapped out on the side of the road! I'm not making the conference and I have fourteen leads waiting for me. You gotta help me out here. I'm not kidding, I've have fourteen PRIMO leads waiting in the lobby of the Mariott... MARIOTT... 
Freeze on him. 
NAME: COACH AGE: 42 OCCUPATION: LIFE COACH & MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER FUN FACT: OFTEN CALLED THE GREEK TONY ROBBINS LIFE EXPECTANCY: STAY FAR, FAR AWAY 
CLICK. The pay phone goes dead. 
COACH Son of a -- (deep breath, soothing) In with anger, out with love. 
Further into the bar, a man in a wheelchair loads a quarter into an old jukebox, but he is instantly pushed away by Bozo. 
Freeze on him. 
NAME: PARA AGE: 29 OCCUPATION: FIREWORKS DEALER COMIC BOOK COLLECTION: RIDICULOUSLY HUGE LIFE EXPECTANCY: THEY WOULDN'T KILL A CRIPPLE... WOULD THEY? 
Bozo's tank-top reads, "ONLY COOL CHICKS CAN DO ME." 
PARA (rolling away) Hey... 
BOZO Shut up, fag. 
Bozo punches in his selection. EDGY CAT (34, samurai pony tail, don't you dare call him an alcoholic) stands by the bar's POOL TABLE powdering his cue. 
EDGY CAT (to Bozo) You're late! 
BOZO Don't dilly-dally then. Rack 'em! 
The CD spins and an 1980s heavy metal classic KICKS IN. 
Bozo, mouthing the lyrics, struts away. 
NOTE: Music plays over all the bar sequences. 
EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT 
P.O.V. - We continue to run. Rapid breathing. 
INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
Beer Guy (kinda handsome... just kinda) sets a keg of beer behind the bar. Freeze on him. 
NAME: BEER GUY AGE: 32 OCCUPATION: BEER GUY/PART-TIME HOST AT RED LOBSTER LIFE EXPECTANCY: WIMPS AND DORKS ARE THE FIRST TO GO... HE'S BOTH 
He talks with BARTENDER (thinning hair, chiseled face, big earring) who preps a drink. 
BEER GUY I mean, we'd been together for so long and then... bang! She drops me. Since then, it's been like a damn country song: she's gone, the car's repossessed, and a father figure made a pass at me. I'm not saying I ever had it. But I have definitely lost it. (beat) Now I haul this swill from armpit to armpit. I used to be a model for Christ's sake. 
Coach has been eavesdropping on Beer Guy and approaches. 
COACH For what, may I ask? 
BEER GUY JC Penny. Spring wear. 
Beer Guy then mimics throwing a sport coat over his shoulder and delivering his "model" cheese smile. 
COACH You know, Chach, catching you at this low point is pure serendipity. 
Trampy seethes as she chooses which obscenity to deliver. 
Adulterer slides a wad of cash to Tuffy. 
ADULTERER Just bring the whole bottle. 
EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT 
P.O.V. - Sprinting and wheezing. The bar lights are ahead. 
INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
Tuffy walks back over to the bar adding Adulterer's cash to a fat roll of money. BELLE (stringy blond hair, cute face, brand-spanking new employee) looks up with surprise. 
Freeze on her. 
NAME: BELLE AGE: 21 OCCUPATION: WAITRESS GOAL: PLAY BELLE IN STAGE VERSION OF "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST" LIFE EXPECTANCY: SAME ODDS AS PLAYING BELLE IN STAGE VERSION OF "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST" 
BELLE If I could made that kind of money, I'd be in Hollywood next week. 
Boss Man walks by and nods to Tuffy, making his way to the rickety side-staircase to the SECOND FLOOR. Tuffy grinds her teeth and moves to the staircase. 
TUFFY 'Round here, there are ways. 
Boss Man winks at Belle. Pure sleaze. 
Freeze on him. 
NAME: BOSS MAN AGE: 47 OCCUPATION: BAR OWNER MOTTO: IF THERE'S GRASS IN THE FIELD, PLAY BALL LIFE EXPECTANCY: REGULAR OR EXTRA-CRISPY? 
EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT 
P.O.V. - Running, approaching the distant bar... 
INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
Bozo looks grimly at a pile of CASH on the ledge of the pool table. Edgy Cat sinks the eighth shot of a NINE BALL game. 
EDGY CAT That cash is gonna look much better in my pocket. 
BOZO (re: mounted head) Ya know, that deer only looks scared when you're in the room. 
Para rolls up behind Edgy. 
PARA Excuse me, please. 
EDGY CAT Jesus! 
Edgy looks to Para, distracted. Bozo quickly replaces the WHITE CUE BALL with one hidden in his waistline. 
EXT. BAR -- NIGHT 
P.O.V. - The bar's a quarter mile away. 
INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
Para's chair back aims at the pool table pocket of which Edgy Cat is lining up for the winning shot. 
EDGY CAT That's all she wrote... 
SMACK! The nine ball sinks in the pocket, the cue ball ricochets away as intended. 
Para flips a switch under his wheelchair's arm rest. The cue ball strays ODDLY into the pocket near Para. Scratch. 
EDGY CAT What?! 
BOZO Ohhh, now that's a rough one. 
EDGY CAT That's motherfuckin' impossible! 
BOZO (crude Oriental accent) Yoh anga will be yoh downfah. Go again? 
EDGY CAT Goddamn it! NO! 
BOZO Oh, come on. Crape Diem! 
Bozo takes the cash from the table. Edgy Cat sulks away cursing to himself and moves to the bar. 
Roadie looks on, sipping a beer. 
Freeze on Roadie. 
BOZO I got two hundred bucks says none of you can beat me! 
BARTENDER Hey! Get quiet or get out. 
BOZO C'mon guys -- 
EXT. BAR -- NIGHT 
P.O.V. - Hurtling toward the double doors and -- 
INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
BOZO Gimme some ACTION -- 
BOOM! The double doors to the bar are kicked open by HERO (30s, rugged alpha man built to kick ass). 
KRASH! Belle DROPS a second tray of drinks -- 
MUSIC CUTS OUT 
Hero is scraped, bruised and bloodied. He is dressed in blue denim and holds a RUST-RED SHOTGUN and GUNNY SACK. 
He SLAMS the double doors shut and props a chair against the handles, securing them. 
HERO Unless you people want to die you'll do what I say and you'll do it fast! 
Bartender cocks his SHOTGUN. 
BARTENDER You hold it right there, mister. 
HERO A storm of hell's coming down on this place any minute! 
BARTENDER Drop the canon! 
Hero puts down the shotgun and moves towards Bartender. 
HERO I'm not armed now, just hear me out. 
BARTENDER I'll drop you and not even think about it! 
HERO Let me explain! 
BARTENDER You got one second to -- 
Hero reveals a drool-dripping, white, GRANDPA BEAST HEAD from the gunny sack and holds it out and for all to see. 
HERO Take a good look and listen to me! There's at least a four of these things out there! 
Grandpa Beast's head has large red eyeballs and a mouth full of jagged, ivory white teeth. It is like an albino jackal head with spiked hair. 
HERO I saw one of them tear up five men like they were corn on the cob! (off silence, shock) I don't know what they are. I don't know where they came from. All I do know is that these fuckers are fast, nasty, and hungry. 
The bar stares at him, slack-jawed. 
HERO And they can fly. Not to mention they got claws like Ginsu knifes and more teeth than a chainsaw. 
The Bartender lowers his shotgun slightly. Fast as a snake, Hero GRABS it. He notices the engraving, "THE JUDGE." 
HERO They're like goddamn blood hungry biker tattoos come to life. They're clocking us. Right now. And we have to lock this bar down! (moving around) That means doors, windows, drains, and basements. We have to do it fast! 
Hero looks out the lone front window. 
HERO (looks to Belle) You! Get on that phone. Call the cops, National Guard, townies, whoever kicks ass and get 'em out here. 
Belle moves to a pay phone at the end of the bar. 
HERO Any questions? 
BARTENDER Who are you? 
HERO I'm the hero -- 
CRASH! A white Beast arms BURSTS through the window and SPLITS Hero right down the middle. The Judge FIRES into the ceiling -- 
SECOND FLOOR 
The Judge's blast blows a toe off Boss Man's RIGHT FOOT as he reaches climax with Tuffy. Boss Man HOLLERS. 
MAIN BAR 
Hero's right half is JERKED outside through the window. 
HEROINE The jungle has a new king. 
Freeze on her.

INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
There is a HOLLER at the top of the stairs. Everyone turns. 
BOSS MAN Is it clear?! 
BARTENDER Yeah. 
BOSS MAN Is there a gun pointing at you? 
BARTENDER Nah, I got the gun. 
Boss Man hobbles down the stairs with the help of Tuffy. His foot is a bloody mess. He is holding a .38. 
BOSS MAN Alright goddamn it! Who shot me!? Who did it!? 
Belle and Bartender move to his aid. 
BOSS MAN My goddamn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!? 
BARTENDER (motioning to Heroine) Her fella. 
HEROINE My husband... 
BOSS MAN Well, where's the sonuvabitch!? 
HEROINE He's dead. 
BOSS MAN What? (noticing destruction) What the hell happened down here?! 
Boss Man looks to Bozo. 
BOZO I didn't do it! It was fuckin' monsters, asshole! 
BOSS MAN Jesus Christ on the cross... someone make sense. 
HEROINE Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. One went through three of your patrons like nothing. 
BOSS MAN So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside? 
HEROINE He only shot you once. 
BOSS MAN Huh? 
HEROINE (re: Bartender) He shot you the other time. 
BARTENDER It was an accident. Sorry. 
Boss Man squints skeptically. Adulterer points to GRANDPA BEAST'S HEAD on the bar. 
ADULTERER Look at it! 
BOSS MAN Fan-fuckin-tastic. 
TUFFY Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go! 
HEROINE Let's lock off this room. 
TUFFY (moving to exit) Never, ever, never. Never, ever, never, baby. I love you -- 
SMASH! Papa Beast BURSTS through the portal window and RIPS Cody's torso from Tuffy's grasp. Tuffy holds his DANGLING ARMS. Blood sprays everywhere. 
TUFFY NOOOOOOOO! 
Papa Beast LUNGES at Tuffy! Bartender SHOOTS, nailing Papa Beast. He hisses, but can't fit through the small window. 
Bartender aims again for a kill shot, but Papa Beast projectile vomits Cody's remains at Bartender. 
Papa Beast retracts out the portal window. Heroine SLAMS the wood shutters closed. 
Tuffy drops Cody's arms. Bug-eyed. She moves, zombie-like, to the staircase. Bartender follows, covered in Papa Beast's bile. Heroine locks the staircase door shut. 
HEROINE Damn it. 
MAIN BAR 
Beer Guy stares at the bile covered Bartender. 
BEER GUY Oh god... 
He hands him a towel. Tuffy slowly walks towards the rest of the patrons. The blood on her face and chest tells them what happened. The horror hits home. 
Heroine eyes the destroyed phone. 
COACH (to Tuffy) Are you -- 
Heroine puts a hand up to silence Coach. 
HEROINE Just let her be... please. (beat) Is that the only phone? 
Bartender emerges from the back holding a mess of plastic and wires. 
BARTENDER The back phone is wrecked, too. 
Trampy's eyes light up and she digs through her purse. 
BELLE This is really happening. I can't believe this is really happening. 
Grandpa and Grandma have calmly re-taken their seats. 
GRANDPA What'd you say? 
GRANDMA I didn't say anything. 
Bartender hesitantly tosses a wash towel over the Grandpa Beast head at the end of the bar. 
Para is awkwardly trying to fix the back of his wheelchair. 
Belle moves over to help and sees a mess of wires coming from the wheelchair's back rest. 
PARA Thank you, but I don't need any help -- 
BELLE What's this? A power magnet or something? 
PARA No. It's nothing. 
Belle puts together his scam with a smirk. 
BELLE I didn't peg you for a con man. 
PARA Hey, it pays more than the couch. 
BELLE Lots of stuff around here does. 
Trampy pulls out a CELLULAR PHONE from her purse. 
TRAMPY Here! 
The group looks over. Adulterer GRABS it. 
TRAMPY Hey! 
ADULTERER Back off! 
Beer Guy walks from behind the bar. 
Papa Beast lets out a HORRID WAIL. The group jumps back, covering their ears. Then, something really odd happens. Momma tosses Junior in the air, opens her wide jaws and SWALLOWS HIM WHOLE. 
INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS 
Adulterer's eyes widen. 
ADULTERER Good christ! They're cannibals! 
COACH Oh dear... 
P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES 
Papa Beast moves behind Momma Beast and grabs hold of her. 
INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS 
A steady "thud-thud-thud" rhythm vibrates the bar. Grandpa's drink starts to hop to edge of his table with the beats. The group maneuvers to get a better look. 
TRAMPY Oh... my... god. 
PARA What are they doing now? 
P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES 
Yes, Momma Beast and Papa Beast are having MONSTER SEX. 
INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS 
BOZO Dude, they're humpin'! 
P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES 
Unlike humans, Papa Beast finishes and the birth cycle lasts all of thirty seconds. Momma Beast's belly balloons up and she squats. POP! A SLIMY OBJECT the size and shape of a vacuum cleaner drops from her. 
INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS 
Trampy VOMITS. 
P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES 
The slimy object SPLITS in half. The two halves spring appendages and raise their heads. The TWIN SISTER BEASTS have been born. 
Papa moves forward and cleans off his new baby girls. The Beast Girls look at the bar and hiss in unison. 
INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS 
Heroine's eyes bulge. 
HEROINE Get back! 
SLAM-SLAM! The two hissing Beast Girls strike the bar front. 
Roadie shoves that board back over the hole. Beer Guy is holding back the still heaving Trampy's hair. 
BOZO Any more ideas, Animal Planet? 
COACH I-I-I was just being proactive... 
BEER GUY (to Bozo) Hey, you weren't helpin'! 
BOZO Go douche. 
BARTENDER What the hell now? 
ADULTERER We're stuck in here. That's what. 
Bozo pops open a beer off the back of Para's wheelchair. 
Roadie nods to Grandpapa Beast's head on the end of the bar. 
ROADIE Hey, Miss? 
Heroine turns. 
ROADIE If you don't mind me asking, how did you run into these things? 
BOSS MAN More importantly, how did you run away from these things? 
HEROINE Well, it all started about forty hours ago... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Hero turns as a shrill HISSING comes from the shadows... 
INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
HEROINE It happened fast... 
EXT. GAS STATION -- LATE DAY 
Heroine and Tubbs emerge from the gas station shop. 
HERO Move it! 
Heroine and Tubbs hear the growing cries of the Beasts. 
Their loot hits the pavement as they run. 
HERO Get in the car, baby. 
Hero drops the spilling gas nozzle. Tubbs slides into the back as Heroine jumps into the driver's seat. 
Hero runs over the top of the Camaro and slides into the sunroof. He grabs a rifle and aims toward the leaking gas pool. Something rises in the gas station. 
INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
HEROINE That's when I saw three others... just for a second. 
EXT. GAS STATION -- SUNSET 
Three lean, muscular shapes rise from the shadows. 
HERO Roll! 
Heroine fires up the car and tears out. Hero shoots and the station becomes a FIREBALL. 
INT. CAMARO -- CONTINUOUS 
HEROINE Close the roof! 
Hero lowers into the back seat and starts to close the roof as STRIPPED COUSIN BEAST lands on top of the car... 
HERO Shit! 
Stripped Cousin Beast PUNCHES through the back window, reaching for them. Heroine jerks the wheel. 
The car 180's and the Beast sails off of the car into darkness. The Camaro tears down a tangent dirt road. 
HERO We made it! 
Hero reaches back to give a "five" to Tubbs. Tubbs doesn't respond. Heroine is the first to see Tubbs' quivering, HEADLESS body in the back seat. 
INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
Heroine stands near Grandpa Beast's head. 
HEROINE It must have smelled the blood or something. We buried the body and got back on the main road when... 
INT. CAMARO -- NIGHT 
BOOM! Grandpa Beast LANDS on the front hood of the Camaro. 
Heroine and Hero SCREAM and rev the engine, swerving madly as Grandpa Beast VOMITS on the windshield. 
HERO Break! 
Heroine slams on the breaks. Grandpa Beast slides back, holding onto the grill. 
HERO Go! Go! Go! 
Grandpa Beast tears into the engine through the grill as sparks and smoke shoot out. Heroine jerks the steering wheel. 
HERO Look out! 
INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
HEROINE And that's how I ended up here. 
BARTENDER And the head? 
INT. CAMARO -- NIGHT 
The car crashes into a ditch, DECAPITATING Grandpa Beast. 
HEROINE (points to map) East. Why? 
PARA Did you ever slaughter? Slaughter livestock? 
HEROINE Previous owners did, I think. 
COACH What are you talking about? 
PARA Slaughterhouse run-off used to be drained into piping that ran through the mountains. 
Para points along the map as he explains. 
PARA Earthquakes often cracked the piping and those flow lines were condemned, but never drained. 
COACH Cheese n' rice... 
TRAMPY I still don't get it. 
PARA What I am saying is... there's a distinct possibility that what we are up against is the result of steady stream of blood and tissue that has been leaking into the caves. And a day ago... something broke out. 
The group is silent. 
BOZO The first order of business is gettin' a big fuckin' tampon in that cave! 
PARA Nope, that wouldn't do it. 
FROM ADULTERER'S P.O.V. - He peeks out the hole and sees nothing but the dark night. Bartender eyes him. 
BARTENDER I wouldn't do that. 
BOZO They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road, they'd be easy pickings. 
HEROINE (to Adulterer) Careful. 
ADULTERER I'm telling you, I don't see a thing -- 
BOINK! Papa Beast's claw POKES into his eye. Adulterer JERKS away holding his blood squirting eye socket. 
FROM OUTSIDE 
P.O.V. - The eye sees its owner stumble back and fall to the floor holding his face. 
INSIDE 
Coach and Trampy move to help Adulterer. 
FROM OUTSIDE 
The eyeball fires into Papa's drooling mega-mouth. SLURP! 
INSIDE 
BASH! A Beast arm BURSTS through the side wall and SNAGS Coach's pants and boxers. He screams and lunges forward. He is BOTTOMLESS. 
HEROINE Everyone stay in the middle of the room! Off the walls! NOW! 
Everyone obeys her command to get in the middle of the room. 
Belle hands Coach a little menu to cover himself with. 
HEROINE Now, does everyone agree that they are still out there? 
The group nods. 
HEROINE (to Bozo) 'Eh, Chief? 
BOZO ...Duh. 
Trampy holds Adulterer's wounded head. 
TRAMPY He's out cold. 
BELLE I know some first aid if we have a kit. Do we? 
BOSS MAN In the kitchen, under the sink. 
HEROINE No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed. 
TUFFY (to Coach) There's some sweats in my bag behind the bar. 
COACH Thanks. 
SECOND FLOOR 
Bozo gets off the floor again. He may have filled his pants. 
BOZO Just a bat! I'm okay! Just a bat! 
OUTSIDE THE DOOR 
BARTENDER If he doesn't shut up... 
COACH He is human kabob. 
SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN 
The room is like a converted pantry. Boss Man lies on a cot, kissing Belle. A tiny wall fan spins providing ventilation. 
Belle pulls away and brushes back her long hair. 
BELLE Doesn't your foot hurt? 
BOSS MAN I can't feel a thing, Hon. 
BELLE (touching his crotch) How 'bout now? 
BOSS MAN You're a bad girl, aren't you. 
Belle, a bit high, sways and starts to remove her clothes. 
BELLE Um-hmmm. 
BOSS MAN The girl's got rhythm. 
She takes off her blouse and tosses it at him. She then lifts up her skirt and bends over, giggling. 
BOSS MAN There it is. 
BASEMENT 
Roadie emerges with two crates. He dumps them on the floor. 
ROADIE This is all junk. 
Beer Guy holds a rusted machete. 
BEER GUY This could come in handy. 
HEROINE Let's get everything upstairs. 
Heroine moves to the stairs, but stops. She grabs Tuffy by the arm and takes her aside. 
HEROINE I'm sorry. 
TUFFY Don't worry, I'm fine. Really. 
HEROINE I admire your strength. 
TUFFY Trust me, I plan on having a full breakdown when this is over, but for now, we all have to be strong, right? 
Heroine reaches into her shirt and pulls out an IDENTICAL LOCKET as Tuffy's. She opens it and displays a picture of a LITTLE GIRL. 
HEROINE This is my daughter, Charlie. She's all I'm after. 
TUFFY (fighting back tears) Oh... 
HEROINE And I'm gonna need your strength, every bit of it. 
TUFFY You have it. 
HEROINE Good. But still do me a favor. 
TUFFY Name it. 
HEROINE (with a wink) Don't tell anyone I have a soft side. 
TUFFY (tiny smile) Deal. 
SECOND FLOOR 
Bozo turns and points the gun around the room. He sees the CB. It is like an intercom with a cable running outside. He drops the shotgun and fidgets with the CB knobs. 
BOZO Hello? Anyone there? We need help out here at the United Nations Tavern. Send guns, tanks, and all that shit. 10-4. S.O.S. 
BOSS MAN Hoh-SHIT! Help!! Help me!!! 
Belle falls into Boss Man's arms for a HIDEOUS KISS. 
BOSS MAN NO! NO! NO! 
Boss Man shoves the bloody Belle back against the wall. 
Sister Beast #1 pokes her head inside the room, hissing. 
MAIN BAR 
Heroine and the others, just returning from the basement, hear the mayhem from upstairs and the kitchen. 
OUTSIDE THE DOOR 
Coach fumbles desperately with the jammed lock, trying to use his fingernails to turn the metal stump. 
COACH Great god, why do you damn me?! 
SECOND FLOOR 
Bozo bangs on the door and looks over his shoulder at the Momma and Papa Beast chomping at the wall. 
BOZO GET ME OUTTA HERE!!! 
MAIN BAR 
The group is mesmerized. 
PARA Oh please, no. 
SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN 
Boss Man uses the cot to block the Sister Beasts from entering. They hiss and shred the cot fabric. 
BOSS MAN They're getting in! Somebody help! 
SECOND FLOOR 
Bozo kicks and punches the door. 
BOZO HELP!!! GODDAMN IT!!! 
MAIN BAR 
Heroine charges up the staircase. Roadie rips the sawed-off weapon from Beer Guy and runs for the kitchen. 
OUTSIDE THE DOOR 
BARTENDER The key broke off! 
HEROINE (to Coach) Move it! 
Heroine rips the earring from Bartender's ear. He YELPS. She jams the backing into the lock. 
SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN 
Boss Man crawls for the door. Sister Beast #1 fires out a whip-like tongue and snags Boss Man's damaged foot. He howls in pain. Sister Beast #2 tongue-lasso's his other foot. 
OUTSIDE THE DOOR 
Heroine's picking fingers are bleeding from her effort. 
BOZO (O.S.) HELP ME PLEASE!!! 
SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN 
Boss Man is pulled towards the Sister Beasts. 
BOSS MAN HELLLLLP!!! 
Roadie kicks open the door and FIRES at the Sisters. They dive back out of the room screeching. 
SECOND FLOOR 
BOZO HELLLLLLLLP!!! 
Right behind Bozo, the boards fly off the portal window. 
Papa Beast flies at Bozo. Bozo spins and aimlessly FIRES his shotgun, hitting Papa Beast directly in the groin. 
BOSS MAN Two. 
HEROINE How many can it hold? 
BOSS MAN Six. 
HEROINE Max? 
BOSS MAN Seven. 
HEROINE It's gonna fit thirteen. 
BOSS MAN Thirteen clowns wouldn't fit. 
HEROINE (with hand out) Keys. 
ROADIE What're you planning? 
HEROINE Three of us go. Two to defend, one to drive. We back up to the bar and then tear ass out of here. 
BOSS MAN Sounds sketchy. 
HEROINE Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die. 
Boss Man reluctantly pulls out some keys that are on a string around his neck. 
ROADIE Give 'em to me, I'm going. 
BARTENDER You're trusting that con? He'll ditch us and never look back. 
ROADIE Fuck you too. 
BARTENDER Get in line! 
HEROINE Hey! I'm not trusting him either, that's why I'm going with. 
Coach stands forward. 
COACH "Courage is being scared to death, but saddling up anyway." (off blank stares) The Duke. I will go. 
HEROINE This is it. They have this place surrounded, but if we go under them we might just make it. 
BARTENDER This is a bottleneck waiting to happen. 
SMACK! Bozo SLAPS Coach's ass. 
BOZO This one's great under pressure. I wish you luck. 
HEROINE The rest of you prepare the weapons, whatever you got left. 'Cause when we crash through those walls, we're bringin' death with us. 
Heroine takes The Judge from Bartender and hands it to Coach. 
COACH No, I don't believe in guns. 
BARTENDER This ain't time for a political stance. 
Coach takes the rusty machete from Beer Guy. 
COACH This doesn't run out of ammo. 
BARTENDER Got ya. 
Heroine, Roadie, and Coach move to the basement. 
BOZO Hey! 
The three look to Bozo, who offers a parting nod. 
BOZO When you get to that truck... drive it like you stole it. 
INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS 
At a booth, Trampy re-bandages Adulterer's eye. 
TRAMPY How does it feel? 
ADULTERER Lousy. 
TRAMPY You still have one left. 
ADULTERER Yes, the silver lining. 
ROADIE Shhhhhhhhhhhhh. 
INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
Tuffy stands by a far wall, looking through the planks for movement. At the bar, Beer Guy makes MOLOTOV COCKTAILS. 
Bozo moves close, slaps Beer Guy's constructing hand. 
BOZO Ah-ah-ah! You're doing that all wrong! 
BEER GUY What do you know? 
BOZO I know you're doing it wrong. 
BEER GUY Prove it. 
Bozo grabs a cloth rag and moves to the alcohol bottles. 
BOZO Move aside, princess. 
INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT 
The tunnel is thin and no more than SIX FEET HIGH. Cherry red fluorescent lights line the top of the tunnel and kneehigh marijuana plants are along the ground soil. There are thick pipes above the plants that work as a makeshift watering system. There is about six inches of water on the floor. 
COACH (to Roadie) You and I are similar. We both have accents. We both travel a lot. We both don't really have homes... 
ROADIE You should be quiet. 
COACH I am sorry, I ramble when I'm nervous. 
HEROINE Quiet. 
Coach bites his lip, dying to say something. 
COACH It's just that this seems like the opportune time for someone to be horribly... offed. 
ROADIE What did I say? 
COACH Sorry. I'm done now. 
INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
Bozo stuffs the cloth rag into one of the bottles. 
BOZO You don't want the rag touching booze, that way you can hold it and ensure it explodes when you throw it. 
PARA You sure? I thought the rag had to touch? 
BOZO I'm sure. 
Bozo finishes the Molotov cocktail and grabs a beer. 
BOZO Perfecto. What we should do, though, is put those peanut barrels to use. Fill 'em with booze and line up some planks. If the walls come down... we hit 'em Donkey Kong style. 
Para and Beer Guy eye the three large peanut barrels, perfect for bomb-making. 
PARA Genius. 
BEER GUY You aren't nearly as dumb as you look, are you? 
BOZO Next time, look within. Stereotyping can be ugly and hurtful. 
Bozo looks to Trampy, putting an arm around her shoulder. 
BOZO Excuse me for being forward, but I'm curious about your dimensions. 
INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT 
Roadie leads the way and glares at the opposite end. The tunnel slightly curves, so he can't see the whole way down. 
ROADIE Hold up. You hear something? 
A SCRATCHING sound is heard from above. 
ROADIE They're trying to burrow through the tunnel walls. 
HEROINE Move. 
The scratching sound increases, now heard from the far end of the tunnel as well. 
COACH Like moles these things. 
COACH They will write stories of your bravery. 
ROADIE If there's anybody left. 
The two men climb up the ladder leading to the ground above. 
At the top, Roadie pushes off the plywood covering. The two men peer into the night and spot the TRUCK. 
INSIDE KEG ELEVATOR 
Heroine wedges the door closed. The Beast continues to try to get in. Heroine bangs the top of the small elevator... 
HEROINE Send it up! Send it up! 
MAIN BAR 
Tuffy backs up and hears the screams from the keg elevator. 
TUFFY Hey! Hey! She's in the shaft! 
Beer Guy hits the button. The gears grind and start to pull the elevator up to the main floor. 
INSIDE KEG ELEVATOR 
Heroine squirms as the elevator rises. 
HEROINE Move it! Move it! Move it! 
As Teen Beast starts to tear at the base of the rising keg elevator in the shaft, Heroine pounds and tears at the few planks above her in the keg elevator. 
MAIN BAR 
Beer Guy hits the button. 
BEER GUY Come on! 
BOZO Ol' Crazy Horse has seen it. 
TUFFY Shut up! 
INSIDE KEG ELEVATOR 
The elevator SHAKES. Heroine POUNDS a hole through the elevator top. She tries to squeeze through the SMALL HOLE. 
Teen Beast BITES through the floor board of the keg elevator. 
CLANGGG! The elevator stops. Heroine lurches and grabs the greasy cables to stop her fall. 
HEROINE Goddamn it! 
MAIN BAR 
TUFFY It stopped. It fuckin' stopped! 
INSIDE KEG ELEVATOR 
Heroine screams as the elevator shakes. Teen Beast is struggling to climb right under her. 
MAIN BAR 
TRAMPY Do something! 
INSIDE KEG ELEVATOR 
HEROINE I'M ALIVE! OPEN THE DOOR! 
MAIN BAR 
Tuffy moves for the keg door. Adulterer grabs The Judge from Bartender. 
ADULTERER Stop! 
TRAMPY What the fuck are you doing?! 
ADULTERER They can't get in here! We agreed! They'll get us! 
TUFFY She can make it! 
ADULTERER I will not die because of her! 
BARTENDER Don't be stupid, drop the gun! 
The group jumps back. Blood rockets out. His body is pureed down the tiny hole. 
HEROINE Get on the tables!!! On the tables!!! 
Everyone struggles to get on the tables. 
CRASH! Teen Beast's arm reaches up and GRABS Para's wheelchair, violently shaking it. Para FALLS to the floor. 
Teen Beast's arm grabs Para's leg... 
PARA HELP ME!!! 
BOZO Bonsai! 
Bozo jumps from a table and STOMPS on Teen Beast's arm. He picks up Para and TOSSES him onto a table. 
BOZO Hot potato!!! 
Bozo leaps back onto a table. POP! The power cuts out. The room goes black. 
BEER GUY We're gonna die! 
ADULTERER What the hell?! 
HEROINE Settle down! 
TRAMPY Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! 
And with that, the shouting and pounding stops. The group nervously shuffles around the tables. 
There's silence. 
Dead silence. 
Then, far is the distance, beyond the walls, a sound is heard. It's screaming. And it's approaching. Rapidly. The survivors maneuver to peek out the front walls. 
BARTENDER What's that? 
Tuffy sees what is coming. 
TUFFY They didn't make it. 
EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS 
Being held by Papa and Momma Beast, Roadie and Coach are both rushed towards the wall like human battering rams. 
ROADIE RUN!!! 
THUD! The first strike causes the men to HOWL. 
INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS 
The survivors shake in sickened silence. From beyond the walls, they can hear high-pitched SCREAMS. 
THUD! THUD! THUD! With every strike, a splattering of blood spits through the planks of wood. 
BARTENDER That wall's coming down! 
BOZO Commence Plan B! 
The entire group goes into motion. 
HEROINE What's Plan B? 
BOZO Just watch the floor and keep the others safe! 
THUD! THUD! THUD! With a final furious strike, a few wood planks splinter. Papa Beast sticks in his head and hisses. 
BOZO Bomb's away!!! 
From the bar, Beer Guy, Tuffy, and Adulterer release the first peanut barrel. It's ablaze and sails straight for Papa Beast. BLAM! It explodes, bursting open the wall and knocking back Papa Beast. The wooden walls go up in flame. 
Para, on a side table, reaches out and grabs Boss Man's .38 from the floor. 
The second peanut barrel is released. It sails outside the breach, but it doesn't explode. Nevertheless, the Beasts stay far away. 
Teen Beast madly rips floor boards away, moving towards Para's table. Teen Beast bursts through the floor, knocking Para to the floor. 
Para crawls to his fallen wheelchair. Teen Beast spots him, moves in to feed. 
Para points his seat back at the scattered .38 bullets and flips the armrest switch. SNAP! The bullets jump to the power magnet. Para yanks one free, loads the pistol and turns just as Teen Beast strikes... 
The people amass at the opening, but Heroine stops them from advancing. The group stares the dark night. Silent. 
HEROINE She's still out here. 
Heroine eyes the truck, seeing something she likes. 
HEROINE Stay put. 
She creeps out alone. 
HEROINE Where are you... come on... 
Nothing. Just smoke. And silence. 
HEROINE Come on! Come on! 
From the smoke, a smoldering Momma Beast charges like a bull. 
At the truck, Heroine opens the back doors and dives in, leaving the doors open. Momma Beast gives chase, entering the back. 
INSIDE TRUCK 
Heroine is deep into the truck as Momma Beast enters. She advances, hissing. 
HEROINE Come and get me you blood-chugging CUNT! 
Momma howls and charges. Heroine slides out the side keg door, locking it behind her. Before Momma can see the trap, Beer Guy slam closed the rear doors. 
OUTSIDE TRUCK 
Beer Guy latches it. Trampy comes around the truck. 
TRAMPY You got her? You got her! 
HEROINE Not for long, we gotta burn it. 
Heroine looks to the others at the breach. 
HEROINE Come on! Let's blow this thing! 
The others move into action. Beer Guy takes off his shirt and shoves it into the fuel tank. Adulterer and Bozo, with Para riding piggyback, help. They use the Molotov cocktails to make a fuel trail leading away from the truck. 
BEER GUY When this lights, run like hell. 
About fifteen yards away from the truck. Bozo throws his silver-plated American Eagle lighter to Heroine. 
HEROINE (catching lighter) Here we go... 
Then, a noise: EOCH-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK! 
A deafening pattern of sound erupts from within the truck. 
It's Momma Beast. Again and again. 
TUFFY What is that? 
HEROINE She's calling for help. 
Heroine drops the lighter onto the fuel. It races for the truck. When feet away, COUSIN BEAST lands, stomping out the fire with his foot. 
BOZO The fan has officially been buried in the shit. 
Instantly, another beast, AUNT BEAST, lands on the top of the truck. These Beasts are like the others, but stripped. The group gasps. Trampy backs away. 
TRAMPY We have to run -- 
BURST! Trampy's rib cage is ripped from her body. The culprit, UNCLE BEAST, stands behind her. Her organs drop like a box of vegetables. Cousin Beast lets out a high-pitched roar. From atop the truck, the rear doors are ripped open. Momma Beast emerges. 
HEROINE Get to your cars!!! 
The Beasts spring into action, chasing the group. 
Bozo, with Para on his back, sprints for his car. Aunt Beast RIPS Para from Bozo's back. 
BOZO Motherfucker! Give him back! 
Bozo runs for his Trans-Am. Para falls to the ground, still alive. Bozo turns back and sees him. 
BOZO Oh Jesus! 
PARA HELLLPPP! 
BOZO (overly endearing) I meant to tell you so much! 
The remaining cars maneuver to hit the open road. 
INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS 
Grandpa and Grandma hold each other tight. Uncle Beast enters, moving to their table. It moves in for the kill. 
Grandpa kisses his wife gently. 
GRANDPA Close your eyes, hon. 
The Beast OPENS its massive jaws and... CRASH! Bozo's car DRIVES through the bar, SMEARING the Beast. 
INT. BOZO'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS 
BOZO YOU ARE SUCKING MY DICK!!! 
Bozo guns the engine, crashing out the other end of the bar. 
EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS 
Bozo's car veers, flipping over a pile of rubble. 
BOZO Motherfucker!!! 
Bozo squirms in his flipped car, UPSIDE-DOWN. 
He hears a Beast approaching. He pulls out a BUTTERFLY KNIFE from the open glove box and SAWS at his safety belt. 
Cousin Beast leans into the passenger side of the car and looks him right in the eye. Bozo raises the knife. 
BOZO Lord, if I die, bury me upside down so the world can KISS MY ASS! 
Cousin Beast leaps in. 
EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS 
The remaining TWO CARS race down the road. 
INT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS 
With the peddle to the floor, Bartender drives. 
BARTENDER I think we're in the clear -- 
BAM! Momma Beast lands on the roof. She reaches inside and yanks out Bartender's throat. The car veers. 
Tuffy rights it, leaning over and stomping on the gas. Momma yanks at the door, pulling it open. Tuffy pushes out Bartender's corpse and JERKS the wheel. 
IN THE BACK 
Momma Beast falls back, knocking down Heroine. Momma Beast nearly falls out, but manages to grab the rear gate with one claw. Defenseless, Heroine backs away. Momma Beast holds on tightly, pulling herself onto the bed of the truck. 
Tuffy stares back through the glass, unable to do anything. 
Momma Beast lunges towards Heroine. Momma Beast's claw snags Heroine's locket, jerking Heroine right up to the creature's face. The locket catches Momma's attention for split second. 
Her remaining eye goes from the picture of Charlie to Heroine. 
Momma's mouth opens wide. Heroine screams! 
And then, a beam of the RISING SUN catches the gold locket and burns into Momma's eye. In one quick motion, she's gone, taking the locket with her. 
Heroine lets out her breath, reaching around her neck for what is no longer there. The truck SKIDS to a halt. Tuffy jumps out. 
TUFFY Are you okay?! 
HEROINE I don't know, I think -- 
ADULTERER (O.S.) Hey! 
They both jump as Adulterer approaches. 
ADULTERER Are you two all right? They left! We made it! I think we made it! 
TUFFY They'll be back. 
HEROINE We're safe until dark, but we need to find other people. 
Heroine rises and moves to the cab of the truck. She finds a pack of cigs under the visor. Pops in the lighter. 
TUFFY They're alive! 
The shudders SMACK against the wall. 
INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY 
Adulterer holds a shattered PICTURE of his wife and two kids. 
He sighs and puts it down. 
ADULTERER I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... 
EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- DAY 
The sun shines bright in the cloudless sky. There is a stiff wind that stirs up the dust. Bartender's car slowly lurches up the street. 
INT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS 
Heroine and Tuffy skeptically look at the surroundings. 
HEROINE It's right up there, in the back of the store. 
EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- CONTINUOUS 
The car pulls up in the back of the store and stops. They get out, looking around. Tuffy holds a machete. Adulterer kneels against his car. 
HEROINE Where is everyone? 
ADULTERER I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl? 
HEROINE She's supposed to already be here. 
TUFFY Your family? 
Adulterer shakes his head, acknowledging their death. 
TUFFY I'm sorry. 
Adulterer sheepishly nods. 
HEROINE This place is a ghost town. 
The group makes their way to the store front, peeking beyond the glass doors. 
ADULTERER (pointing) Look! 
In the distance, in middle of a dusty parking lot, CHARLIE stands staring at them. 
HEROINE Charlie? 
Heroine runs to her and the others follow. Charlie fidgets awkwardly. She cries and blood stains her dress. 
HEROINE Charlie! 
As Heroine nears, Adulterer GRABS her arm. 
ADULTERER Stop! There's something wrong! 
HEROINE Honey!? 
The group eyes Charlie, noticing Heroine's locket around her ankle, leading to a slightly ajar manhole cover. Suddenly, the sunlight starts to FADE. They look up the sun. 
TUFFY Oh god. 
The MOON moves in front of it -- a SOLAR ECLIPSE. Beast HISSING and FLUTTERING is heard. Heroine looks from left to right, panic stricken. 
CHARLIE Mommy! 
The sunlight is fading. The manhole cover shakes, something is holding Charlie in place. Heroine lurches forward, but Adulterer holds her at bay. 
ADULTERER It's a trap! 
At a standstill, the group looks around for options. In the distance, the darkness of the eclipse rolls towards them. 
Adulterer reacts, grabbing Tuffy's machete and lunging for Charlie. The strike cuts the chain at her ankle. The manhole cover POPS off and a Beast claw sinks into Adulterer. 
The darkness covers the manhole. Momma Beast rises, hoisting Adulterer's blood dripping body from the ground. 
ADULTERER (gurgling blood) Run!!! 
Heroine scoops up her child, moving away from Momma Beast.

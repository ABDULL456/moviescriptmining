Screenplay by

Story by 
GEORGE LUCAS and MENNO MEYJES 
FADE IN: 
EXT. DESERT OF THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST - DAY 
A mountain peak dominates the landscape. 
TITLES BEGIN. 
Riders on horseback cross the desert. From this distance they appear to be a company of Army Cavalry Soldiers. 
CLOSER ANGLES ON THE RIDERS 
reveal only details of saddles, hooves and uniforms. The riders are silhouetted against the rising sun as they ride into an ancient CLIFF PUEBLO. 
The OFFICER IN COMMAND raises his hand halting his troops. 
OFFICER Dis-mount! 
RIDERS climb down from their mounts... and only now do we realize that this is a TROOP OF BOY SCOUTS, all of them about thirteen years of age. The "Commanding Officer" is only their SCOUTMASTER, Mr. Havelock. 
One of the Scouts, a pudgy kid named HERMAN, steps away from his horse, bends over and pukes. The other Scouts rag on him. 
FIRST SCOUT Herman's horsesick! 
A BLOND SCOUT, however, befriends Herman. He has a thatch of straw-colored hair and the no-nonsense expression common to kids whose curiosity and appetite for knowledge exceed what they teach in school. Additionally, he has adorned his uniform with an authentic HOPI INDIAN WOVEN BELT. 
SCOUTMASTER Chaps, don't anybody wander off. Some of the passageways in here can run for miles. 
Two Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff. 
INT. THE PASSAGEWAY - DAY 
The two boys head down the passageway. It's dark, and the temperature drops several degrees. Spiders have built huge webs that get caught in the boys' hair. 
HERMAN appears very uncertain as to the wisdom of this enterprise, but he's drawn on by his companion's adventurous curiosity. 
CONTINUED: 
HERMAN I don't think this is such a good idea. 
LAUGHTER is HEARD; the Blond Scout pulls Herman forward toward its source. 
The VOICES GROW LOUDER now as the boys get closer to their source. The light of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. The boys approach cautiously, careful to stay hidden. 
HERMAN What is it? 
This is what they see: 
FOUR MEN digging with shovels and pick-axes. They have broken into one of the pueblo's SECRET CHAMBERS... called "Kivas." 
The men are ROUGH RIDER (his name describes his dress), ROSCOE (a Bowery Boy bully of 14) and HALFBREED (with straight black hair that cascades over his shoulders). 
And the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN FELT FEDORA HAT. He has his back turned to us, but we would be willing to bet anything that this is INDLANA JONES. 
However, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by the lantern's glow, we are shocked to discover that it is someone else. 
We'll call him FEDORA. 
TITLES END. 
The TWO BOYS are mesmerized by what they see. 
Now we realize that the Blond Scout is actually young INDIANA JONES. 
FEDORA Alfred, did you get anything yet? MAN Nothing. Dig in. 
Two of the men stand and look at ROSCOE who steps forward holding a box in his hands. 
ROSCOE Hey, I've got something! 
Whoops from the other men. 
ROSCOE I got something, Garth! 
CONTINUED: (2) 
ROSCOE rushes forward and gives FEDORA the box. Fedora steps toward a lantern resting on a rock. 
ROSCOE I got something... I got something right here. 
More whoops from the other men. 
FEDORA puts the box on the rock next to the lantern. HALFBREED pushes ROSCOE as he jumps with excitement. ROUGH RIDER steps forward to look at the box as Fedora opens it. 
ROSCOE (more whoops; then) Oh, look at thatl (more whoops) We're richl We're rich! 
HALFBREED Shut up. Shut up. 
BRODY Yes. My treat. 
INT. INDY'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY 
Bursting with STUDENTS, all competing for his attention at once: "Professor Jones! " "Doctor Jonesl " etc., etc. 
INDY Shush! Shush! Shushl 
INDY shoulders his way to the desk of his secretary, an overwhelmed Teaching Assistant named IRENE. 
IRENE Doctor Jones! I'm so glad you're back! Your mail is on your desk. Here are your phone messages. 
MALE STUDENT Doctor Jones, you promised... Doctor Jones 
IRENE This is your appointment schedule. And these term papers still haven't been graded. 
INDY takes the term papers then turns to enter his PRIVATE OFFICE. Students once again CLAMOR for his attention: "Doctor Jones!" "Wait, Doctor Jonesl" "My grade!" "Sign my registration card!" 
INDY silences the mob with a raised hand. 
INDY (very efficiently) Okay. Irene, put everyone's name on a list, in the order they arrived, and I'll see each and every one of them in turn. 
The Students descend upon poor IRENE, each claiming to be first. INDY slips into his - 
PRIVATE OFFICE 
where he goes to his desk and finds a thick envelope with a foreign postmark on it. 
INDY (softly; reading) "Venice, Italy." 
Then, INDY stuffs his mail into his coat pockets, goes to the WINDOW, slides it open and STEPS OUT INTO THE GARDEN. 
EXT. SIDE OF COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY 
INDY escapes through the garden. 
EXT. FRONT OF COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY 
INDY walks briskly toward the street; smiling, erUoying his freedom. As he arrives at the curb, a LONG BLACK PACKARD SEDAN pulls up before him. 
MAN (O.S.) Doctor Jonesl 
THREE MEN step out of the sedan. Everything about them bespeaks "G-MAN." The First Man steps behind Indy. 
MAN Doctor Jones? 
INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DAY 
INDY is ushered into a large Art Deco apartment and left alone. Numerous museum-quality artifacts are displayed around the room. Indy takes this opportunity to examine them. 
After a moment, WALTER DONOVAN enters from across the room. During the brief time that the door is open, we HEAR a COCKTAIL PARTY going on in the next room: VOICES and SOFT PIANO MUSIC. 
DONOVAN strides across the room toward INDY. Although in his late fifties, Donovan has the broad shoulders and trim physique of a much younger man. Dressed in a tuxedo, he exudes both confidence and power. 
DONOVAN I trust your trip down was comfortable, Doctor Jones. My men didn't alarm you, I hope. 
He shakes hands with INDY. 
DONOVAN My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan. 
INDY I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive. 
DONOVAN Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities. (beat) Have a look over here. This might interest you. 
CONTINUED: 
DONOVAN goes to a table where an object is wrapped in cloth. He throws back the cloth revealing a flat STONE TABLETabout two feet square, inscribed with letters and symbols. 
INDY looks impressed. He puts on his glasses to make a closer examination. 
INDY Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid- Twelfth Century, I should think. 
DONOVAN That was our assessment as well. INDY Where did this come from? 
DONOVAN My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper. (beat) Can you translate the inscription? 
Translating the inscription is no easy matter, even for someone as knowledgeable as INDY. 
INDY (stumbling through it) "... who drinks the water I shall give him, says the Lord, will have a spring inside him welling up for eternal life. Let them bring me to your holy mountain in the place where you dwell. 
Donovan pours champagne into several fluted glasses as Indy reads. 
INDY Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon, to the Temple where the cup that" 
Suddenly INDY stops and looks up at DONOVAN with a startled expression. 
INDY "Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever. " 
(CONT'D) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
DONOVAN (reverently) The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea. 
INDY rubs his chin with a dubious expression as he takes the glass of champagne DONOVAN now offers him. 
INDY The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before. DONOVAN Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail. (beat) Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to! 
He immediately empties his pockets of his own mail taken earlier in the day from his college office and finds the envelope with the Venice postmark. 
INDY (as he tears it open) Venice, Italy! 
BRODY What is it? 
INDY uncovers a small book. It looks like a JOURNAL or DIARY. Indy flips through it: Page after page of handwritten notes and drawings. BRODY glances at it with great curiosity. 
INDY It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me? 
CONTINUED: (2) 
BRODY I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly. 
INDY Do you believe, Marcus? 
As INDY asks the question, he turns to a PAINTING on the wall: A depiction of Christ on the Cross, his blood being captured in a golden chalice. 
A SECOND PAINTING on the wall shows Eleventh Century Crusaders plummeting to their deaths over a high cliff. One Crusader, however, floats safely in midair because he holds the Grail in his hands. 
INDY Do you believe the Grail actually exists? 
BRODY The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us. 
BRODY sees that INDY is unsatisfied by this response. 
BRODY But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith. 
INDY Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now. 
BRODY I'll tell him we'll take two. 
EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY 
A LIMO is parked beside a PRIVATE AIRLINER that bears the DONOVAN CORPORATE LOGO. BRODY peers inside to DONOVAN and INDY. 
BRODY Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice? 
DONOVAN (overlapping) Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you. 
CONTINUED: 
BRODY (overlapping) Schneider? 
DONOVAN (overlapping) I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal. 
BRODY Oh, well. That's good. Thank you. 
BRODY and DONOVAN shake hands. INDY steps from the back seat of the limo. He turns back to Donovan and shakes his hand. 
DONOVAN Doctor Jones. Good luck. Be very careful. Don't trust anvbody. 
INT. AIRLINER - FLYING - DAY INDY opens the Grail Diary and thoughtfully turns through the pages. He stops at one page and glances at a PENCIL SKETCH of what might be a stained-glass window. Below the sketch is a SERIES OF NUMBERS. 
EXT. THE PRIVATE AIRLINER - FLYING - DAY 
SUPERIMPOSED over a MAP that traces a course from New York City to Venice, Italy. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. VENICE - BOAT LANDING - DAY 
INDY and BRODY disembark from the Water Bus onto the Boat Landing as other Gondoliers steer their boats in the water. 
INDY Ah, Venice... 
BRODY Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him? 
INDY I don't know. Maybe he'll know us. 
CONTINUED: 
Suddenly a WOMAN comes up to him. Attractive features. Blonde hair. Eyes that are bright and intelligent. 
ELSA Doctor Jones? 
INDY Yes? 
ELSA I knew it was you 
She looks at him with an appraising expression that is brazenly flirtatious. 
ELSA you have your father's eyes. 
INDY is instantly attracted to her. 
INDY And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you. 
ELSA Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for. 
INDY grins, enjoying the repartee. The WOMAN turns to BRODY, who tips his hat. 
ELSA Marcus Brody? 
BRODY That's right. 
The Woman, DR. ELSA SCHNEIDER, extends her hand to BRODY. 
INDY It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet. 
The missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield. 
ELSA Just like your fathergiddy as a schoolboy. 
INDY laughs. 
ELSA Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this? 
INDY (chuckles) He never would have made it past the rats!  He hates rats!  He's scared to death of them! 
CLOSE - A HAND 
as it lights a match. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL KAZIM dropping the lighted match into the oil-slick water. 
INDY AND ELSA 
ELSA holds the torch. INDY looks around. Listens. Something is wrong. And then he sees the GLOW OF FIRELIGHT dancing across the Catacomb walls. 
This is followed by THOUSANDS OF RATS FLEEING from around the corner of the Narrow Passageway, STAMPEDING toward ELSA and INDYSHRIEKING and SQUEALING as they approach. 
The rats literally wash over themlike a rodent tidal wavein their efforts to escape a: 
HUGE ORANGE BALL OF FIRE 
ROARING around the corner hurtling towards themfeeding on the oil slick; consuming the oxygen. 
ELSA SCREAMS. 
INDY Get back! Back against the wall. 
INDY braces his back against the altar and TOPPLES THE COFFIN with his feet. It CRASHES against the stone platform and SPLASHES into the water. 
INDY Quick! Under it! 
They jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned coffin. 
INDY Air pocket! 
ELSA hesitates. INDY literally DUNKS her and pushes her underneath. 
UNDER THE COFFIN 
ELSA surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin, SPUTTERING and SPITTING. 
Now INDY pops up into the air pocket. He looks at ELSAthey are both soaking wet. 
INDY Don't wander off. 
CONTINUED: 
ELSA What? 
INDY disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin. 
ELSA What? 
UNDER THE WATER 
INDY swims, looking for an escape route. 
UNDER THE COFFIN 
The rats are beginning to force their way inside, swimming through the water and climbing on ELSA, who squirms and screams in terror. 
INDY pops back up through the water. 
INDY I think I've found a way out. Deep breath. 
ELSA groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the water. 
EXT. VENICE PIAZZA - OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY 
The perfect picture postcardSt. Mark's Square and the Grand Canal beyond. Cafe customers are startled to see INDY and ELSA climb out of the sewer, wet and smelly. Indy looks around at the postcard-perfect setting and smiles. 
INDY (wryly) Ah, Venicel 
Indy's delight, however, is short-lived since KAZIM and TWO OTHER TURKISH AGENTS are running towards them with drawn guns. 
He grabs ELSA by the hand and the two of them run down the dock and LEAP INTO A MOTORBOAT. 
INT. THE MOTORBOAT - DAY 
INDY fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock... but not before a Turkish Agent JUMPS in with him. 
ELSA grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while INDY and the Turk trade punches. 
EXT. THE HARBOR - DAY 
Indy's Speedboat BOUNCES across the choppy waters heading in the direction of the DOCKED STEAMSHIP. 
KAZIM and his men rush to TWO MORE SPEEDBOATS tied to the dock. 
They chase after INDY. 
KAZIM In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border. 
KAZIM walks away. 
INT. VENICE APARTMENT - DAY 
CLOSE ON THE WATER-SOAKED PAPER IMPRESSION: The rubbing taken from the shield of the Grail Knight. 
BRODY is giving it careful study while he dabs the lump on the back of his head with an ice pack. 
INDY How's the head? 
BRODY It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm... 
INDY, wearing a bathrobe, leans over to study the impression. 
INDY The Knights of the First Crusade laid siege to the city of Alexandretta for over a year. The entire city was destroyed. 
BRODY lowers the ice pack from his head and looks at INDY. 
INDY The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon." (pause) But where exactly? 
CONTINUED: 
BRODY Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map. 
BRODY picks up the Grail Diary. 
BRODY He must have pieced it together from clues scattered through the whole history of the Grail Quest. A map with no names. 
INSERT: A PENCIL-DRAWN MAP 
It covers two pages of the Diary. BRODY's finger moves across it. 
BRODY Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city. 
INDY (solemnly) Alexandretta. Now we know. 
BRODY Yes. Now we know. 
INDY (rising) Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun. 
INDY closes the Grail Diary and puts it into the pocket of his robe. 
BRODY What about you? 
INDY I'm going after Dad. 
INT. INDY'S BEDROOM - DAY 
INDY opens the door. His bedroom has been ransacked...the mattress on the floor, the drawers turned out. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
INDY approaches another door (Elsa's bedroom) and knocks. 
INDY Elsa? 
He goes in. 
INT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY 
... and finds that Elsa's bedroom is in a similar ransacked state to his own. The room is empty. 
He is worried for her, knocks and calls out: 
INDY Elsa? 
He steps into the room and knocks upon the bathroom door. INDY Elsa? 
He opens the bathroom door, peering inside. 
INDY Elsa? 
INT. ELSA'S BATHROOM - DAY Elsa is standing before a mirror, wearing a silk bathrobe. She gasps, startled, as INDY enters. He retreats back into her bedroom as she reaches up to turn off a record player sitting on a ledge above the bathtub. 
INT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY 
ELSA joins INDY, waiting in the ransacked room. she looks around in shock. 
ELSA My room! 
INDY Mine, too. 
ELSA What were they looking for? 
She looks to INDY, who pulls the Grail Diary from his pocket. 
INDY This. 
CONTINUED: 
ELSA The Grail Diary. 
INDY Uh-huh. 
ELSA You had it? You didn't trust me! 
INDY How dare he?! 
Simultaneously knocking the BUTLER cold with one slug on the jaw. The Butler falls against a wall tapestry, sliding down to the floor, out cold. 
INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY 
INDY and ELSA move cautiously and quietly down the wide, vaulted hallway. APPROACHING VOICES ARE HEARD. Indy and Elsa creep past a room full of NAZI SOLDIERS working around a large table with a map atop it.. 
INDY reacts to the sight of them. 
INDY (to ELSA; softly) Nazis. I hate these guys. 
INDY and ELSA continue down the hallway. Indy carries a gun in his hand and his whip hangs from his belt. He steps to a closed door and listens. 
INDY This one. I think he's in here. 
ELSA How do you know? 
INDY points out an ELECTRICAL WIRE. 
INDY Because it's wired. 
He studies the situation for a moment, then decides to enter one of the other doors. He knocks at the doorthere is no response. He looks back at ELSA and enters. 
INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY 
The room is dark and empty. INDY throws open the window shutters and looks out. RAIN comes down in sheets. There is a wide ledge beneath each window but below that is a SHEER DROP. Indy wants to get out onto the window ledge, which is several yards away. 
ELSA Indy? Indy? 
INDY reassures her. 
INDY Don't worry... this is kid's play. I'll be right back. 
He leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some wires that protrude from the castle wall above the next window. 
He gives the whip a forceful tug to make certain it will hold his weight. 
EXT. THE CASTLE - DAY 
INDY SWINGS from the window to the stone gargoyle. 
CLOSE ON THE WINDOW LEDGE 
A PAIR OF WOODEN SHUTTERS seals the window. 
INDY takes hold of the bullwhip with both hands, pushes off with his feet... swings toward the shuttered window with his feet extended... CRASHING THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS as a CLAP OF THUNDER disguises the noise. 
INT. THE ROOM - DAY 
INDY CRASHES THROUGH SHUTTERS AND GLASS into the room. The broken shutters hang by their hinges. Rain and cold air whip through the open window. 
No sooner does Indy get to his feet, than a VASE COMES CRASHING DOWN ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD. 
Stunned, INDY sinks to one knee... and Indy's father, PROFESSOR HENRY JONES, steps out of the shadows. 
HENRY Junior? 
INDY gets to his feet. 
INDY (a reflex) Yes, sirl 
CONTINUED: 
This reply is a kneejerk reaction on Indy's part. Now they look at each other. 
HENRY It is you Junior! 
INDY (an old familiar irritation) Don't call me that, please. 
HENRY (amazed) But what are you doing here? 
INDY I came to get you! What do you think? 
NAZI VOICES ARE HEARD approaching. INDY and HENRY press themselves against the wall, Henry still holding the broken vase in his hand. 
INDY steps to the window and looks down. HENRY moves to a lamp, holding the vase under the light for a closer look. 
HENRY (sotto, mumbled) Late Fourteenth Century, Ming Dynasty. 
HENRY is all about the broken vase which he still holds in his hand. Father and son get onto crossed lines for a couple of moments. 
HENRY Oh, it breaks the heart. 
INDY (quietly to himself) And the head. (to HENRY, aggrievedly) You hit me, Dad! 
HENRY (referring to the vase) I'll never forgive myself 
INDY (surprised, misunderstanding) Don't worryI'm fine. 
HENRY Thank God! 
CONTINUED: (2) 
HENRY has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase... he is examining the broken end carefully. 
HENRY ... it's fake. See, you can tell by the cross section. 
HENRY I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers. 
INDY (overlapping) Will you take it easy....! 
HENRY Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place? (points towards the NAZIS) So it wouldn't fall into their hands!! 
INDY I came here to save you. 
HENRY Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior?? 
INDY's eyes blazes His nostrils flares He's so pissed off, he literally RIPS A MACHINE GUN from the hands of one of the startled soldiers... and for a moment we think he's going to use it on his dad. 
INDY I told you-- 
He turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting all three NAZIS to ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room. 
INDY --don't call me Junior! 
HENRY looks shocked and horrified. 
HENRY Look what you did!! 
Indy grabs him and pushes him ahead. 
HENRY (aghast) I can't believe what you just.... 
INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY 
INDY leads HENRY down the hallway as he searches for Elsa. 
INDY Elsa? Elsa? 
He opens a door and enters: 
INT. FIRST CASTLE ROOM - DAY 
INDY and HENRY rush back into the room where ELSA had been left, only to find: A Nazi COLONEL HOLDING ELSA HOSTAGE. 
His name is VOGEL: a vicious-looking, lantern jawed brute. One arm is wrapped around Elsa's waist, the other hand presses the muzzle of a LUGER behind her ear. 
VOGEL That's far enough Put down the gun, Doctor Jones. Put down the gun or the Fraulein dies. 
HENRY But she's one of them! 
ELSA Indy, please! 
HENRY She's a Nazi! 
INDY What?! 
INDY  is thrown. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at ELSA, then back to his father. Everyone is yelling at once: 
HENRY Trust me! 
ELSA Indy, no! 
VOGEL I will kill her! 
HENRY Oh yeah? Go ahead! 
INDY No! Don't Shoot! 
CONTINUED: 
HENRY (to Indy) Don't worry. He won't. 
ELSA Indy, please! Do what he says! 
HENRY And don't listen to her! 
VOGEL Enough! She diesl 
VOGEL jams the barrel of the luger painfully into ELSA's neck. Elsa SCREAMS. 
INDY Wait!  Waitl 
And then Indy gives in. He drops the machine gun to the table and it slides across, SHATTERING GLASS. HENRY GROANS audibly. 
VOGEL releases his grip on ELSA and shoves her toward INDY. She is propelled directly into his arms. He holds her tightly. She buries her face in his chest. 
ELSA I'm sorry. 
INDY comforts her. 
INDY No, don't be. 
Her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the Grail Diary. 
ELSA But you should have listened to your father. 
She steps back next to VOGEL. INDY is stunned. HENRY gives him his most withering look of reprimand. 
INT. BARONIAL ROOM - DAY 
A large baronial room decorated with ancient tapestries and suits of armor. Firelightfrom the giant fireplacedances across the ceiling and walls. 
INDY and HENRY are ushered in, hands tied behind back, accompanied by VOGEL and ELSA and TWO NAZI GUARDS. 
SINISTER MAN Welcome to Iskenderun. The Director of the Museum of Antiquities has sent a car for you. 
BRODY takes off his hat. 
BRODY Oh, what?... your servant, sir. 
SALLAH And I am his. 
SINISTER MAN Follow me, please. 
The man turns and joins a SECOND MAN. BRODY and SALLAH follow them. 
BRODY My reputation precedes me. 
SALLAH There is no museum in Iskenderun. 
The SECOND MAN overhears SALLAH. He and his companion turn quickly. 
SECOND MAN Papers please. 
SALLAH Papers? (laughs) Of course. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
SALLAH puts Brody's luggage down and glances at BRODY. 
SALLAH Run. 
BRODY does not run. SALLAH pats his clothing, searching for his papers. 
BRODY Yes. 
SALLAH Papers, sir. Got it here. 
SALLAH laughs and pulls out a newspaper. 
SALLAH Just finished reading it myself. (laughs; then, to Brody) Run! 
BRODY looks confused. SALLAH shows the newspaper to the SECOND MAN. 
BRODY Yes. 
SALLAH Egyptian Mail. Morning edition. (to Brody) Run! 
BRODY Did you say...? Uh, uh... 
SALLAH puts the newspaper in front of the SECOND MAN's face, then punches him through the newspaper. 
SALLAH Run! 
The SECOND MAN falls, knocking over a vendor's stand. SALLAH and BRODY begin to run. SALLAH knocks the FIRST MAN into another vendor's stand. The STAND COLLAPSES on impact. 
SALLAH grabs BRODY and pulls him through the crowded streets. 
SALLAH (to Brody; pointing) Okay, okay, quick, quick, quickl Hide in that doorl Hide in that door! 
SALLAH points to a DARKENED DOORWAY, hung with a curtain, at the top of a ramp. BRODY runs up the ramp, throws back the curtain and disappears into the darkness. 
CONTINUED: (3) 
ThenMETAL DOORS ARE SLAMMED behind Brody and we realize that he has actually run into the back of a Nazi TROOP TRUCK. 
SALLAH runs after the Truck until he reaches a wall, then leans against the wall dejectedly as the Truck drives away with BRODY inside. 
INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY 
The room is dark. Ancient, floor-length drapes cover the windows. A HUGE FIREPLACE that's nearly large enough for a man to stand upright in dominates one wall. 
The NAZI GUARDS have tied INDY and HENRY back-to-back in a pair of chairs. ELSA and DONOVAN stand over them. VOGEL enters. 
HENRY Intolerable. 
VOGEL Doctor Schneider. Message from Berlin. You must return immediately: a rally at the Institute of Aryan Culture. 
ELSA So? 
VOGEL Your presence on the platform is requested... at the highest level. 
ELSA Thank you, Herr Oberst. (to DONOVAN) I will meet you at Iskenderun. 
DONOVAN Take this Diary to the Reich Museum in Berlin. It will show them our progress, ahead of schedule. Without a map, I'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir. 
He hands her the Grail Diary. 
VOGEL (to DONOVAN, meaning Indy and Henry) Let me kill them now. 
CONTINUED: 
ELSA No. If we fail to recover the pages from Brody, we'll need them alive. 
DONOVAN (to VOGEL, with a helpless shrug) Always do what the doctor orders. 
DONOVAN leads VOGEL out. The NAZI GUARDS follow. Once they are gone, ELSA turns to INDY. 
ELSA Don't look at me like thatwe both wanted the Grail, I would have done anything to get it. You would have done the same. 
INDY shakes his head "no." 
INDY Dad! 
HENRY What? 
INDY Dad! 
HENRY What? 
INDY Dad! 
Finally they turn their heads in the same direction. 
HENRY What? 
INDY Head for the fireplace! 
HENRY Oh. 
BANGING, ROCKING and HOPPING their chairs, they work their way INTO THE FIREPLACEthe only safe place from the now ROARING FIRE. 
CONTINUED: 
INDY I think I can get these ropes off. 
Indy struggles to free his hands. His foot kicks out and accidentally hits a metal grill that operates a Secret Door. 
INDY Whoopsl 
The fireplace floor rotates like a Lazy Susan and Indy and his father find themselves in the: 
INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY 
where a NAZI RADIOMAN wearing headphones sits at an elaborate panel of dials, switches and meters, and a WOMAN stands over a map plotting coordinates. Their backs are turned to INDY and HENRY. 
The floor begins to rotate again, and INDY and HENRY find themselves back in: 
INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY 
inside the fireplace, still tied back-to-back. 
HENRY Our situation has not improved. 
INDY glances over his shoulder at HENRY. 
INDY Listen Dad... I'm almost free. 
INDY's foot hits the grill again... and the fireplace rotates to: 
INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY 
FOUR NAZI RADIOMEN and the WOMAN are still hard at work with controls and coordinates. Suddenly the Woman looks up and spots HENRY and INDY. She screams. 
WOMAN Alarm! 
Now the RADIOMEN turn to see HENRY and INDY. 
WOMAN Schnel!! 
TWO NAZIS draw their revolvers and FIRE SEVERAL SHOTS at INDY and HENRY 
INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAWN 
INDY and HENRY rotate into the room which is now an INFERNO. The carpet, drapes and furniture are all ablaze. 
HENRY This is intolerable! 
INDY I'm out, Dad! 
INDY finally breaks free. And he immediately begins to untie his father. 
HENRY Well done, boy! 
INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY 
All FOUR RADIOMEN now have their guns drawn. They activate the lever and begin to rotate through the Secret Door. 
INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY 
The RADIOMEN appear in the fireplace on the other sidebut there is NO SIGN OF INDY AND HENRY. 
The RADIOMEN move cautiously toward the flame, shielding their faces with one hand, holding their guns with the other. Is it possible that INDY and HENRY escaped through these flames? 
Not a chance. 
They've hidden themselves UP THE CHIMNEY. And now they DROP DOWN, BEHIND the RADIOMEN. 
One of the RADIOMEN grabs INDY by the neck. As they struggle they fall against the rotating wall and disappear into the next room, leaving a frightened HENRY behind. 
HENRY presses against the wall, which rotates again. As he disappears into the next room, a DEAD NAZI RADIOMAN swivels into the room. The other NAZIS rush forward to him. 
INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY 
INDY picks up a BUST OF HITLER and uses it to jam the rotating wall in place, sealing the NAZIS inside the burning room. 
INT. CASTLE HALLWAY- DAY 
Vogel strides purposefully down the hallway. He BARKS an order, and TWO MORE NAZIS fall into step with him. 
THE RIDERLESS MOTORCYCLE 
drives on toward the other NAZI SOLDIERS now approaching the guardhouse, COLLIDING WITH TWO OF THEM. 
The remaining NAZI SOLDIER maneuvers his motorcycle around his fallen comrades and continues the chase. 
INDY AND HENRY 
As the remaining NAZI SOLDIER rides alongside their motorbike he cocks his gun, preparing to fire. 
INDY quickly jams the remaining portion of the flagpole through the spokes of the Nazi's front wheel. 
The NAZI SOLDIER'S MOTORCYCLE FLIPS THREE TIMES, throwing him high into the air. 
CONTINUED: 
INDY glances back and smiles, but the smile fades as he looks forward again to see a sign at a CROSSROAD. Arrows pointing in opposite directions indicate the way to BERLIN or VENEDIG. 
Indy starts down the road marked VENEDIG. 
HENRY Stop! 
INDY What? 
HENRY Stop! Stop! 
The motorbike skids to a stop. 
HENRY You're going the wrong Way!  We have to get to Berlin! 
INDY (pointing towards Venedig) Brody's this way. 
HENRY My Diary's in Berlin. 
INDY You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map. 
HENRY There is more in the Diary than just the map. 
INDY All right Dadtell me. 
HENRY Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge. 
INDY What final challenge? 
HENRY Three devices of such lethal cunning. 
INDY Booby traps? 
CONTINUED: (2) 
HENRY Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm. 
INDY But what are they? Can't you remember? 
HENRY I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember 
INDY Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den? 
HENRY Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail. 
INDY What about Marcus? 
HENRY Marcus would agree with me. 
INDY Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christl 
HENRY slaps him across the face. INDY is rocked to his foundations, not by any means entirely by the blow itself. 
HENRY That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me? 
INDY This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom. 
HENRY Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her. 
EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY 
Arrows point in opposite directions to VENICE and BERLIN. The CAMERA MOVES IN on the portion of the sign reading BERLIN. 
EXT. CITY SQUARE - BERLIN - NIGHT 
A Nazi Rallya book-burning is in process. 
The mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing by the minute as College Students and Nazi Brownshirts continually toss more books onto the fire. 
Flags, banners and standards displaying the swastika are waved rhythmically from side to side in a motion that echoes the mounting frenzy of the enormous crowd. 
INDY and HENRY walk toward the Square. Indy wears the uniform of a Nazi Soldier. He is now buttoning up the tunicwhich happens to be several sizes too big. 
HENRY My boy, we are Pilgrims in an unholy land. 
Then... Indy sees something that makes him stop in his tracks. WE PAN ALONG HIS LINE OF SIGHT to: 
THE PODIUM 
where high-ranking Officers of the Third Reich stand flanking ADOLF HITLER as they oversee the rally. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
INDY (O.S.) Fahrscheine, bitte. 
MALE PASSENGER Nein. 
VOGEL turns to see: 
INDY 
WEARING THE HAT AND JACKET OF THE CHIEF STEWARD. 
MALE PASSENGER (O.S.) Ich habe ihn night gesehen. 
INDY Tickets please. 
The Passengers do not react to the request, made in English. 
INDY Fahrscheine meine Dame. Bitte. 
VOGEL 
approaches HENRY, still hidden behind his newspaper. Again, VOGEL uses his walking stick to lower the paper, revealing Henry's face. 
VOGEL Guten Tag, Herr Jones. 
Now INDY, still playing the role of Steward, asks VOGEL for his ticket. 
INDY Fahrscheine meine Herr. 
VOGEL Weg. 
INDY Tickets please. 
HENRY looks confused. 
VOGEL (in German) Was? 
VOGEL glances up and recognizes INDYwho quickly punches Vogel in the face, knocking him toward the window. In another quick move, Indy TOSSES HIM OUT THE WINDOW onto the tarmac below. 
Shocked Passengers blink in bewilderment. 
INDY (in German; with a shrug) No ticket. 
Everyone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it in Indy's face. 
EXT. AIRFIELD TARMAC - DAY 
VOGEL gets to his knees as the huge Zeppelin rises into the sky above him, revealing an airplane attached to the belly of the airship. Vogel shakes his fist at the rising Zeppelin. 
VOGEL Du wirst nochmal boren von mir! 
INT. ZEPPELIN - DAY 
INDY and HENRY together again in their compartment. 
HENRY You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience. 
CONTINUED: 
INDY (meaning ELSA) That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa---er, her grandfather! 
HENRY Well, I'm as human as the next man. 
INDY I was the next man. 
HENRY (laughs) Ships that pass in the night... 
HENRY opens his Diary and begins to thumb through it. 
INDY Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake. 
HENRY Hmmm... What did we talk about? 
INDY We didn't talk. We never talked. 
HENRY And do I detect a rebuke? 
INDY A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that. 
HENRY Actually, I was a wonderful father. 
INDY When? 
HENRY looks up from his Diary. 
HENRY Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self- reliance. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
INDY What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years. 
HENRY You left just when you were becoming interesting. 
INDY Dad, how can you --? 
HENRY (interrupting) Very well. I'm here now. 
He closes the Diary and leans back in his seat. 
INDY Thanks. 
Suddenly, INDY's attention is directed to: 
TWO SCREAMING MESSERSCHMIDTS 
coming in low. Guns BLAZING. 
As BULLETS EXPLODE around them, INDY and HENRY jump over a stone barricade. Henry, frightened, grabs at Indy. 
HENRY Those people are trying to kill us! 
INDY I know, Dadl 
HENRY It's a new experience for me. 
INDY It happens to me all the time. 
EXT. ROAD - DAY 
An OLD MAN kneels at his car repairing a rear tire. 
THE MAN 
turns to the wheel, the hubcap in his hands. Suddenly the wheel moves forward, startling the Old Man. 
INT. THE CAR - TRAVELING - DAY 
INDY has the throttle down, both hands tightly gripping the steering wheel. HENRY is a very nervous passenger. 
INDY sees a LOW-FLYING MESSERSCHMIDT coming up behind him in the SIDE MIRROR. 
As the Messerschmidt ROARS by overhead, BULLETS EXPLODE around them, narrowly missing the car. 
HENRY This is intolerable! 
INDY This could be close. 
EXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY 
The car races toward a TUNNEL that cuts through a steep MOUNTAINSIDE. 
The Messerschmidt bears down on Indy's car, machine guns CHATTERING. 
The car ENTERS the tunnel. The Messerschmidt cannot pull up in time. It SLAMS into the MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL, SHEARING OFF its WINGS. 
INT. THE TUNNEL - DAY 
The FLAMING FUSELAGE continues to ROCKET through the tunnel like a bullet down the muzzle of a gun. SPARKS fly as its belly SCRAPES against the pavement and the sides of the tunnel. 
INT. THE CAR - DAY 
Indy and Henry look over their shoulders to see this wingless BALL OF FIRE gaining on them; about to overtake them. 
HENRY Faster, boy --faster! 
EXT. THE ROAD - OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY 
The car exits the tunnel at top speed and veers off the road. The flaming Messerschmidt fuselage shoots past and EXPLODES in the middle of the road. 
INT. THE CAR - DAY 
As the car emerges safely from the flames, Henry wipes the sweat from his brow. 
HENRY Well, they don't come any closer than that! 
HENRY looks out the windshield and sees the second Messerschmidt SCREAMING out of the sky toward them. 
EXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY 
The MESSERSCHMIDT drops its single UNDER-FUSELAGE BOMB. It EXPLODES in the road directly ahead of the car, missing it by only several feet. 
THE CAR 
FALLS INTO THE HOLE made by the bomb. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. ROAD - DAY 
INDY climbs out of the car, still in the bomb crater. He turns back to HENRY. 
INDY Dad, he's coming back. 
INDY and HENRY run down the mountainside to: 
A DESERTED MEDITERRANEAN BEACH - DAY 
INDY and HENRY run to the shoreline. Indy reaches for his gun, tucked in his pants. He opens the chamberthe GUN HAS NO BULLETS. 
THE MESSERSCHMIDT 
swings around and is coming in for another pass. 
INDY AND HENRY 
exchange a wordless glance. They don't even think about running: there is no place to run to. HENRY hands his case to INDY. 
VOGEL snatches the canteen away from BRODY before he can drink. 
VOGEL We must be within three or four miles. Otherwise we are off the map. 
CONTINUED: 
He hands the map to ELSA, drinks from the canteen, and hands that back to DONOVAN. 
DONOVAN Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind. 
BRODY You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend. 
HENRY and SALLAH are at INDY's side as he views Donovan's party in the distance. Parked nearby is a CAR containing all of their supplies. 
INDY Ah, I see Brody. He seems okay. They've got a tank. Six-pound gun. 
Then Donovan notices a reflection from the hills. 
What he sees is: 
THE SUN REFLECTING OFF THE LENSES OF INDY'S BINOCULARS 
HENRY What do you think you're doing?! Get down! 
INDY Dad, we're well out of range. 
At that moment the tank FIRES A SHELL in their direction. 
It WHISTLES overhead and BLOWS UP THE PARKED CAR. INDY, HENRY and SALLAH cover their heads as automobile fragments rain down upon them. 
SALLAH That car belonged to my brother- in-law. 
INDY (gesturing to the others) Come on--come on! 
EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY 
VOGEL I can't see anyone up there. 
CONTINUED: 
DONOVAN Maybe it wasn't even Jones. 
ELSA No. It's him all right. He's here somewhere. 
DONOVAN (to VOGEL) Put Brody in the tank. 
KAZIM peers over a rock, pointing his rifle at the group below. 
DONOVAN (to ELSA) Well, in this sun, without transportation, they're as good as dead. 
BULLETS EXPLODE off the vehicles and cliff. DONOVAN and ELSA duck. 
A NAZI SOLDIER falls from the tank as BULLETS EXPLODE around him. 
KAZIM'S MEN, BRETHREN OF THE CRUCIFORM SWORD, continue to FIRE. ELSA and DONOVAN take cover beside the parked car. 
DONOVAN It's Jones, all right. 
ANGLE ON INDY'S GROUP 
INDY and HENRY, followed by SALLAH, take cover behind a rock to watch Kazim's Men and the Nazi Troops exchanging fire below them. 
HENRY Now, who are all these people? 
INDY Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation. 
CUT BACK to the action. The BRETHREN are firing at the DONOVAN party and are being fired on by the Donovan party. 
TWO NAZI SOLDIERS throw HAND GRENADES into the cliffs. They EXPLODE, killing one of Kazim's Brethren. 
The battle continuesa fierce exchange of GUNSHOTS, GRENADES and MACHINE GUN FIRE with losses on both sides. 
INDY AND SALLAH 
crouch behind a rock watching as men on both sides of the battle run amongst camels and horses. 
INDY I'm going after those horses. 
SALLAH I'll take the camels. 
INDY I don't need camels. 
SALLAH But, Indy 
INDY No camels! 
DONOVAN AND ELSA 
They look down at KAZIM who lies mortally wounded on the ground at their feet. ELSA looks saddened. 
DONOVAN (re KAZIM) Who is he? 
KAZIM A messenger from God. For the unrighteous, the Cup of Life holds everlasting damnation. 
KAZIM dies. 
INDY 
INDY notices that the side gun that is now firing at him can only pivot so far. Indy makes a mental note of this and while riding right in front of the tank, turns his horse completely around, 180 degrees. The tank starts to follow. 
POV THROUGH THE VIEWING PORT 
VOGEL watches the ground turning 180 degrees as he tries to catch up with INDY. 
Cleverly, INDY has turned the tank directly into a head-on collision course with some of the pursuit vehicles and a Kubelwagon. 
The tank and the Kubelwagon smash into each other, the German military sedan becoming lodged between the treads while blocking the front view and any use of the six-pound cannon on the turret. 
INDY, meanwhile, leans down on his horse, scooping up a stone from the wall of a culvert. He reigns his horse, paralleling the tank, as everyone scurries about inside, looking through viewing ports, trying to figure out exactly where Indy is. 
INT. TANK- DAY 
VOGEL shouts to the Gunner. 
VOGEL Der Kubelwagon sprengen! 
The Gunner puts a shell into the large gun. He FIRES, CATAPULTING THE KUBELWAGON into the air, where it EXPLODES.  The tank drives through the resulting smoke an dust, then rolls over the Kubelwagon, crushing it EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY 
INDY gallops up to the side cannon and jams the stone down the barrel, lodging several rocks inside. Then he steers his horse directly in range of that gun. 
INT. TANK - DAY 
A NAZI SOLDIER pushes HENRY away from the window. 
NAZI SOLDIER Keine Bewegung. 
He points his gun at HENRY and BRODY. 
NAZI SOLDIER Keine Bewegung. 
The smaller gun, blocked by the rocks, BACKFIRES, blowing the breech out into the face of the gunner, killing him and filling the tank with smoke. 
BRODY, HENRY, VOGEL and the driver begin to choke. 
EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY 
INDY rides his horse alongside the tank. 
INDY Dad!  Dad!  Dad! 
INT. TANK - DAY 
HENRY and BRODY still held at gunpoint by the NAZI SOLDIER. 
HENRY Junior? Junior? Junior! 
The NAZI SOLDIER swings his fist, knocking HENRY off his seat. 
EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY 
Smoke pours from the top of the tank as the turret pops open. VOGEL emerges and aims his gun at INDY. 
INDY and VOGEL EXCHANGE SHOTS as Indy chases the tank on his horse. 
INDY pulls the trigger againhis gun is empty! Indy immediately takes the high trail. 
Now INDY is above the tank twelve feet on a paralleling trail. He moves out of the saddle and leaps from the speeding horse onto the trundling tank. 
CLOSE UP - VOGEL 
Hate-staring at INDY 
CLOSE UP - INDY 
Hate-staring back at VOGEL. 
Suddenly, from nowhere a German soldier flies INTO FRAME, tackling Indy. 
CUT TO: 
SIDE ANGLE 
One of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank and like pirates boarding a galleon, Nazi Soldiers leap over the treads and are swarming all over INDY. 
INDY is struggling with a German's Luger. 
INDY presses the luger against his assailant and forces the Nazi to squeeze off a shot into himself. The bullet not only passes through the Nazi, but passes through two other Nazis standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top and three bodies fall away, leaving Indy to stare at the gun in disbelief. Another Soldier leaps from the truck onto the tank and raises his knife as he grabs INDY. They struggle and fall. 
INDY sits up to see VOGEL standing over him. Vogel wraps a chain around Indy's neck. 
INT. TANK- DAY 
INDY appears at the entrance, the chain still wrapped about his neck and held by VOGEL. 
INDY Dad! 
He drops the gun down into the tank. 
INDY Dad! Dadl Get it! 
VOGEL pulls INDY from the tank entrance, yanking on the chain wrapped around his neck. 
EXT. TANK - DAY 
A NAZI SOLDIER approaches. 
As the SOLDIER raises the gun to HENRY's face, BRODY hits him over the head with a canister. The Soldier falls, discharging the gun into the air. 
The BULLET RICOCHETS around the tank, past the Tank Driver who is manipulating levers at the control panel. SPARKS FLY; then the BULLET PINGS AGAINST THE WINDOW and RICOCHETS ONCE MORE, this time passing THROUGH THE TANK DRIVER'S HAT. Blood flows from under the hat as the Tank Driver slumps forward, his body depressing the levers. 
EXT. TANK - DAY 
INDY still hangs from the strap of his leather pouch as the tank swerves, barely missing the rocks and causing VOGEL to fall. Indy finally manages to pull himself atop the tank once more where he punches Vogel over the side, then peers down to HENRY, still inside the tank. 
INDY Dad? 
HENRY You call this archaeology? 
INDY Get out of there, Dad! 
INDY pulls HENRY and BRODY from the tank. VOGEL pulls himself back atop the tank armed again with the shovel which he swings at Indy, who ducks and grabs Vogel's arm. 
BRODY How does one get off this thing? 
As INDY winds up to punch VOGEL he catches BRODY in the face on the backswing, then completes the movement and knocks Vogel down. 
INT. TANK - DAY 
Vogel's hat sails in and falls to the floor. 
EXT. TANK- DAY 
HENRY (to INDY) Where's Marcus?! 
Before INDY can answer, VOGEL is up and swinging with the shovel. Indy ducks but the shovel catches HENRY sending him over the side and onto the moving tread. 
INDY grabs his whip, knocking VOGEL aside. 
As HENRY speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom, INDY, with lightning speed, whips out his bullwhip, wrapping the end of the whip around Henry's right ankle. 
INDY Dad! 
HENRY is bouncing across the treads like a rag-doll. INDY struggles to hold onto the end of the bullwhip. 
INDY Hang on, Dad! 
SALLAH draws his horse next to the treads. He tips his fez to HENEY. 
SALLAH Father of Indygive me your hand! 
VOGEL now punches INDY in the back and grabs him around the neck. Still, INDY refuses to let go of the whip. 
INDY Sallah! Get Dadl 
SALLAH reaches out to HENRY. 
SALLAH Give me your hand! 
SALLAH manages to hold onto HENRY as he brings his horse to a stop just at the cliff's edge. 
INDY finally frees himself of VOGEL's grasp, twisting his arm painfully away from Indy's neck, then landing a hard blow to Vogel's head. 
INDY 
looks down at the fast-approaching cliff, his face filled with horror.  We SEE his HAT BLOW OFF and sail over the cliff's edge. 
VOGEL 
He sees his life passing before him, he screams at the top of his lungs! 
LONG SHOT 
The tank trundles over the cliff and PLUMMETS TO THE BOTTOM. 
EXT. CLIFF EDGE - DAY 
HENRY, BRODY and SALLAH look down at the flaming wreckage of the tank. 
HENRY Junior?! 
We HEAR the TANK EXPLODING. 
SALLAH Indy?! 
HENRY Oh, God. I've lost him. And I never told him anything. I just wasn't ready, Marcus. Five minutes would have been enough. 
And then... looking dazed and bewildered, INDY STAGGERS UP BEHIND THEM. He joins the others at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the wreckage below with a bewildered expression. 
Finally, Henry becomes aware of his presence. 
HENRY says nothing. He just looks at Indy, overcome with emotion. Finally, he throws his arms around him. 
HENRY I thought I'd lost you, boy. 
After a moment, Indy's head clears. And he becomes aware of his father's embrace. Something he hasn't felt in a long timeif ever. And it touches him. He hugs his father back. 
INDY I thought you had too, sir. 
BRODY and SALLAH are moved by this sudden reconciliation. 
HENRY Wellwell done! Come on! 
HENRY pats INDY on the back and Indy collapses, sitting hard on the rocky cliff edge. 
HENRY collapses. Blood flowing from the wound. BRODY and SALLAH rush to his assistance. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
INDY spins toward DONOVAN with murder in his eyes. 
DONOVAN points the gun at him: 
DONOVAN You can't save him when you're dead. 
INDY hesitates. 
DONOVAN The healing power of the Grail is the only thing that can save your father now. It's time to ask yourself what you believe. 
INDY takes in the situation. The two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of him. He walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions. We get silent reaction shotsELSASALLAHBRODYDONOVANregistering their different emotions 
INDY proceeds forward. His hands open the Grail Diary. 
INDY "The Breath of God... Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass. . . " 
INDY takes a few steps forward. 
INDY "The penitent man will pass. The penitent man..." 
INDY stops. He is about to reach the spot where two men have just died. 
HENRY looks at INDY. Indy looks at Henry. 
HENRY (in a raspy voice) "Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass." 
INDY (quietly to himself) The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man... 
HENRY The penitent man. The penitent... 
INDY takes a step forward through the cobwebs. 
CONTINUED: (3) 
INDY The penitent man is humble before God. 
HENRY Penitent. Penitent... 
INDY The penitent man is humble... 
The cobwebs begin to move.... 
INDY He kneels before God. (to himself; suddenly) Kneel!! 
We hear the awful rush of airWHOOSH! Because INDY is in the act of kneeling, only his hat is knocked off and his hair flies in his face. 
Instinctively he ROLLS FORWARD on the ground out of harm's way and looks up. From his new position he is able to see what is causing all the trouble: A RAZOR SHARP TRIPLE PENDULUM. 
INDY gets cautiously to his feet. Now he sees the pendulum has been guarding a SMALL CORRIDOR which turns a corner to the left fifty yards ahead. Wooden wheels turnthe mechanism controlling the spinning blades. INDY loops a rope around the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the blades in mid-swipe. 
INDY I'm through! 
ELSA AND DONOVAN 
DONOVAN We're through! 
BRODY and SALLAH smile, relieved. 
SALLAH (to HENRY) He's all right. 
HENRY shakes his head. 
HENRY No. 
BACK TO INDY 
holding the Grail Diary, reading once again, his fedora now covered in cobwebs. 
INDY "The second challenge is the Word of God. Only in the footsteps of God will he proceed." (to himself) The Word of God... The Word of... 
INDY pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path. Each cobble is engraved with a letter. 
INDY "Proceed in the footsteps of the Word." 
HENRY 
lifts his head painfully. 
HENRY The Word of God... 
BRODY No, Henry. Try not to talk. 
HENRY The Name of God... 
BACK TO INDY 
as he studies the cobblestones before him. 
INDY The Name of God... Jehovahl 
HENRY 
still lies in SALLAH's arms. BRODY leans over him. 
KNIGHT I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me. 
The GRAIL KNIGHT holds his sword out to INDY. 
INDY (gulp) Listen, I don't have time to explain, but 
At that moment DONOVAN and ELSA appear. Donovan turns to face the display of cups. 
DONOVAN Which one is it? 
CONTINUED: (2) 
KNIGHT You must choose. (beat) But choose wisely. For as the True Grail will bring you life the False Grail will take it from you. 
DONOVAN I'm not a historian. I have no idea what it looks like. Which one is it? 
ELSA Let me choose. 
DONOVAN Thank you, Doctor. 
ELSA and INDY exchange looks. He thinks he is seeing her in her true colors. 
ELSA chooses a cupa solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet. 
DONOVAN instantly takes it from her. 
DONOVAN Oh, yes. It's more beautiful than I'd ever imagined. This certainly is the cup of the King of Kings. 
DONOVAN rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water. 
DONOVAN Eternal life! 
DONOVAN drinks from the goblet. 
Then, DONOVAN'S entire body starts to convulse. His face contorts in agony. He grabs his stomach and turns toward ELSA. 
DONOVAN What . . . is . . . happening. . . to . . . me. . .? 
He starts to agefast! His hair grows long and gray and brittle. His face sinks. Fingernails curl back on themselves. Milky cataracts coat his eyes. 
ELSA gasps and screams. 
DONOVAN What. . . is . . . happening. . . ? 
His skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his bones until it splits. His skeletal hands reach for ELSA's throat, choking her. 
CONTINUED: (3) 
INDY rushes forward and pushes DONOVAN away. As he falls he BODY BREAKS INTO FLAMES, then SHATTERS AGAINST THE WALL. 
KNIGHT He chose...poorly. 
INDY studies the array of chalices. 
ELSA It would not be made out of gold. 
INDY picks up another cupa simple earthenware jug. 
INDY That's the cup of a carpenter. 
He and ELSA exchange a look. 
INDY There's only one way to find out. 
INDY goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with water, then pauses. INDY brings the jug to his lips and takes several large swallows. 
A strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and contentment...and we see his wounds begin to heal. 
KNIGHT You have chosen wisely. But the Grail cannot pass beyond the Great Seal. That is the boundary and the price of immortality. 
CUT TO BRODY AND SALLAH who attend to Henry awaiting Indy's return. 
INDY and ELSA come forward with the Grail. 
The TWO NAZI SOLDIERS are over-awed by the possessors of the Grail. They put down their guns and kneel. 
INDY kneels by HENRY's side and tilts his head forward and holds the Grail to his lips. 
HENRY is too weak to even open his eyes. 
HENRY swallows some of the water. Much of it runs down the corners of his mouth. Finally INDY pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in astonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes. The color returns to Henry's face. 
HENRY's eyes open. The first thing he sees is the Grail and they light up. Then they shift to INDY's faceand they light up even more... 
NAZI SOLDIERS 
run forward. SALLAH points a rifle at them. 
SALLAH Drop your guns. Please. 
The NAZI SOLDIERS drop their weapons at their feet and raise their arms in surrender. 
INDY (to HENRY) Dad, come on. Get to your feet. 
ELSA 
steps forward and picks up the Grail. She turns to INDY, her face alight with possession of the Grail.

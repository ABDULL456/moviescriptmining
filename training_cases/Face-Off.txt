FADE INTO: 
SEPIA-TONE FOOTAGE 
of a pig chasing a lion chasing a dinosaur chasing an elephant.  Noah's Ark going round... and round... and round... 
EXT. GRIFFITH PARK CAROUSEL - DAY 
Disjointed CALLIOPE MUSIC as the wheel of fate and fortune goes around until we PULL BACK to reveal: 
JON ARCHER (30) rising winged Pegasus.  On the adjacent unicorn is his son MATTHEW (5).  Clutching a balloon, Matty waves at his dad.  A happy moment, like so many certain to follow -- until we realize we are watching them THROUGH... 
SNIPER'S RIFLE SCOPE - SNIPER'S EYES 
wait until the child clears his aim -- Archer is the target.  They round the bend and disappear... 
MATTHEW 
Loses his grip on the unicorn.  Archer reaches over and pulls him into his lap.  They happily ride together... 
As the horses sweep back INTO VIEW... exposing Archer... 
Now we see the sniper.  CASTOR TROY is cool, efficient, aggressive, sexual.  His finger closes around the trigger. 
BOOM!  A BULLET RIPS into Archer's back.  Bleeding... he drops off his horse... and sinks to the deck of the carousel.  His eyes desperately searching... searching... searching... until he sees -- 
Matthew lies on his back -- still.  Slowly, Archer reaches out and takes Matthew's hand... and now we see COLOR for the first time... 
Blood red... as bleeding father touches bleeding son... 
TILT UP TO the winged Pegasus flying by -- now in full color and UP UP UP TO Matthew's red balloon... floating away. 
HANDEL'S MESSIAH OVER a SERIES OF SHOTS: 
FBI BRIEFING ROOM 
Gazing out the window as dawn breaks over the city below is Jon Archer... older... unshaven... fatigued... his eyes reveal a man in the grip of obsession. 
CAROUSEL HORSE 
sweeps by, as if marking time itself... 
HOLY PLACE 
Smoky, spiritual... dominated by a gleaming, golden cross.  A priest kneels before it -- deep in prayer.  The glimmering cross comes INTO FOCUS... but it's just a light-reflection... off the casing of a large bomb.  This is no chapel... but an atrium.  Somewhere. 
And as the "priest" rubs out his cigarette we see it's Castor Troy -- carefully installing this complex device. 
ANOTHER CAROUSEL HORSE 
sweeps by... 
ARCHER 
pockets his FBI badge, then holsters his gun... 
CASTOR 
sets the bomb timer -- then replaces a wall panel in front of it.  Totally hidden. 
BRIEFING ROOM - CASTOR'S MUGSHOT 
is on a computer screen.  His criminal dossier scrolls by endlessly:  bombings, assassinations, mercenary kidnappings, terrorism-for-hire... 
Rookie agent LOOMIS studies the details carefully.  Other agents -- including BUZZ and WANDA scan computer grid- maps, man phones, etc. amid the take-out cartons and coffee cups.  These people are on high alert. 
ARCHER Any follow-up from L.A.P.D. Intelligence? 
BUZZ No, sir, nothing yet. 
ARCHER Get them on the phone -- now. What about S.I.S. and our airport teams? 
WANDA We've had everything from psychics to satellites on this.  Even if Castor was here... he must have slipped the net by now... 
ARCHER He's here!  And we're going to keep looking until we find him! 
A silence descends on the chastised team.  As they go back to work, veteran agent TITO BIONDI takes Archer aside. 
TITO Jon, these people have been working round the clock -- you gotta cut them some slack... 
Archer considers his best friend's advice -- then... 
POLLUX I hate when you call me bro. 
Pollux heads for the jet.  Castor hands Lunt a wad of cash. 
CASTOR Thanks for babysitting. 
LUNT Anything else? 
CASTOR I'll contact you when we get the rest of the money. (turns to leave) Oh, and stat away from downtown. The inversion layer's going to be pretty thick around the 18th. 
The twins nod... then take off.  Castor heads for the jet. 
INT. JET - DAY 
Castor hustles in -- exhorting the PILOT. 
CASTOR Let's go, let's go! 
As the JET TURBINES start to WHINE, Castor sinks into his seat.  A very sexy FLIGHT ATTENDANT appears and hands him a Scotch.  He downs it, looking her over salaciously. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Would you like anything else? 
CASTOR Hell, yes... (pulls her into lap) It's the only way to fly. 
She smiles, not minding, until the jet suddenly slows its taxi down the runway. 
COCKPIT 
Castor yanks open the door. 
CASTOR What's wrong? 
AT END OF RUNWAY 
A squat car creeps INTO VIEW -- blocking the runway. 
EXT./INT. HUMVEE - MOVING - DAY 
Behind the wheel is Jon Archer.  Beside him is Tito. 
BACK TO ARCHER 
CASTOR It's Archer. (gun to Pilot's head) Go, dammit! 
Suddenly the gun is BLASTED from Castor's hand.  he turns around to see... the Flight Attendant behind them -- holding a smoking pistol.  This is Agent WINTERS. 
WINTERS F.B.I.!  Throttle down, captain! 
But Castor elbows the throttle up.  The jet lurches forward, throwing Winters off balance.  Pollux tackles her as the jet picks up speed. 
INT. HUMVEE - DAY 
Archer slams the vehicle into gear. 
ARCHER Get out. 
TITO You're not playing chicken with two tons of aluminum... 
ARCHER Get out! 
Tito obeys as Archer peels out.  The HUMMER ROARS at the jet. 
The jet picks up speed, trying to get aloft. 
The humvee is aimed right at it... Archer's eyes narrow. 
COLLISION COURSE 
as two hunks of metal bear down.  The machines are seconds apart when -- 
Archer looks up to see... 
Winters' face pressed up against the cockpit window, Castor holding a gun to her head. 
Archer cuts the wheel -- just avoiding the jet.  The Hummer skids to a stop as Federal back-up arrives -- but too late.  Archer watches an FBI chopper -- landing in a swirl of dust. 
As the jet picks up speed... the hatch opens.  Castor blasts Winters in the side and tosses her onto the tarmac. 
INSIDE 
Castor smiles at Pollux, sensing freedom, until... 
KA-CHUNK:  Something POUNDS the jet -- from above. Castor leans out the hatch and sees... 
The chopper on top of them -- Archer at the controls. 
Eye-contact -- years of hatred pass between these men. 
Castor BLASTS at him from the open hatch. 
Castor waits behind a stack of steel drums... his gaze trying to penetrate the darkness... He SNAPS his fingers. The sound ECHOES as he tries to draw Archer in. 
Archer reacts to the sound and SNAPS back -- answering the challenge.  As the deadly beat between them continues -- 
BLAM BLAM BLAM!  Archer spins away just as Castor OPENS FIRE from the gloom... one step ahead. 
INTERCUT as necessary: 
CASTOR Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun. 
ARCHER And how much will your 'fun' net you this time? 
BOOM BOOM BOOM!  Half-blind SHOTS send Castor spinning. A moment later, Archer pursues... SNAP!  He fits a new CLIP into his pistol. 
CASTOR What's it to you?  I declare it. Here I am, back in the States for less than a week -- 
ARCHER You're under arrest.  Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent -- 
CASTOR I've got something going down on the eighteenth... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaoh.  I'll give it up -- but my brother and I have to walk. 
ARCHER No discussion -- no deals. 
CASTOR What're you gonna do with me locked up?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts!  I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now.  What's her name, Janie? 
Enraged, Archer steps boldly forward -- trying to draw his enemy out.  Silence -- then Archer senses... 
Castor is behind him.  He FIRES -- Archer dives away. The BARRAGE CONTINUES -- driving Archer back between two huge turbine engines.  As Archer reloads, he stares at the control panel switches. 
Castor moves in for the kill when he hears a final SNAP- SNAP.  Except it isn't a finger snap... it's two switches. 
VRRRROOOM!  The TWIN ENGINES ROAR on!  Unable to fight the churning tornado-force wind... Castor's blasted across the hangar... slamming hard into the far wall. 
The ENGINES STOP and Archer emerges -- joined by Tito. 
TITO Tell me he didn't get away again... 
Then Tito follows Archer's gaze to Castor's lifeless body.  Still as death -- somehow his mocking smile survives. 
EXT. AIRPORT TARMAC - SUNSET 
Heavily-manacled, an extremely agitated Pollux is herded into a SWAT van by Buzz and Wanda. 
POLLUX Where's my brother?!  I want to see my brother! 
The van takes off -- passing an imposing older man, flanked by two bodyguards.  Bullying through the media, Assistant FBI Director VICTOR LAZARRO scans the devastation. 
Approaching Archer, he watches as Castor's body is loaded on the ambulance.  A sheet covers Castor's lifeless face. 
LAZARRO The oversight committee would've roasted us for this one -- thank God it paid off.  Damn fine work. 
ARCHER Real fine, Victor.  Especially the casualties. 
Archer contemplates the slain agents -- their three bodies laid out in a row -- waiting to be zip-locked. Lazarro reacts grimly as a reporter snaps a photo of the bodies. 
Instinctively, the two men close ranks.  Archer grabs the Nikon, ejects the film, then shoves the camera back. 
LAZARRO Classified information.  No photographs. 
Lazarro puts a caring arm around Archer's shoulder and leads him away from the media... and the carnage. 
LAZARRO You okay, Jon? (off Archer's nod) Then go home.  Tell Eve. 
EXT.  ARCHER'S HOME (SANTA MONICA) - SUNSET 
A renovated Craftsman.  Sipping a carton of milk, Archer pulls into the driveway.  He sits, gathering his thoughts. 
INT. ARCHER'S HOME - NIGHT 
Archer enters and sees his wife EVE.  Handsome, intelligent. 
ARCHER Hi... (no response) ... What's wrong? 
She nods toward the KITCHEN.  JAMIE is there -- a sullen and hard fifteen-year-old.  There are cigarette cartons on the table. 
EVE She complimented for her 'F' in history with an 'A' in shoplifting... 
Archer marches into the kitchen -- noting the crate of Marlboros.  Jamie matter-of-factly pours herself coffee. 
ARCHER Nice stunt, Jamie.  You break the law and I'm expected to ignore it? 
JAMIE That's right -- it's all about you.  Don't even ask me what happened. 
Archer looks to Eve for help.  Eve shakes her head -- nope. 
ARCHER Okay.  What happened? 
JAMIE Like you'd ever fucking believe me! 
She bolts.  In anticipation, Eve calmly opens the door as Jamie rushes out, then closes it behind her. 
ARCHER Answer the question. 
SASHA Look, I'm clean.  I teach kids now -- 
ARCHER Sasha -- you are a felon, on probation for harboring Castor Troy.  So it's in your best interest to cooperate. (as she's silent) Would you like your son put in a foster home? 
Sasha's eyes flash, her body coils -- but she keeps control. 
SASHA No, but I'm sure you'd love it -- you sick bastard. 
ARCHER (unmoved) When was the last time you saw Castor Troy? 
She stares at him with equal amounts of pity and hatred. 
SASHA I haven't seen him for years. 
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
Archer watches as Adam leaves Dietrich and jumps into Sasha's arms.  She hugs him protectively.  Adam sees Archer watching them -- and smiles.  Archer doesn't smile back. 
FULL SCREEN - CASTOR'S REAL FACE 
PULL BACK TO: 
INT. I.C.U. - NIGHT 
Archer slowly circles Castor's muscular, hairy, tattooed body.  Although on life support -- his signature smirk remains. 
ARCHER What about Lazarro? 
BRODIE No way -- the red tape alone would take a month.  This is a black-bag operation -- completely off the books. 
MILLER If you need him, Tito can help you prepare.  But you know the drill: You can't tell anyone -- not the Director, not your wife... nobody. 
Archer's face shows he doesn't like it -- then he nods. 
ARCHER I'm in. 
EXT. ARCHER HOME - NIGHT 
Archer slowly gets out of his car.  Trudging toward the front door, he picks up a basketball and takes a shot. His form is terrible -- he misses by a mile. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Archer passes Jamie's room.  Loud MUSIC POUNDS from within.  He pauses to knock, thinks again, then heads down the hall. 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Eve is in bed.  Archer comes in quietly and sits beside her -- studying her peaceful, sleeping face.  She stirs. 
EVE I was dreaming... 
ARCHER Something good? 
EVE I'm not sure... you were flying this weird old stunt plane... doing flips... walking on the wings... I was watching from the ground -- when you fell.  You had a parachute, but you wouldn't open it. 
ARCHER Did you catch me? 
EVE No. 
ARCHER How come? 
EVE I don't know... (nuzzles him) Maybe because you've never needed my help. 
ARCHER Come on, you made that up, didn't you? 
EVE ... Maybe I did... (teasing) ... maybe I didn't... 
They kiss affectionately.  Passion building, Eve runs her hands over his body -- until her fingers touch a round scar on his chest.  Archer freezes -- mid-caress. 
EVE It's all right, Jon. 
ARCHER After all these years, I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive. 
EVE And you wouldn't be. 
No response.  The pain hidden in his silence chills Eve. 
EVE Things will get better now that you're home.  Everything will be better -- now that... that man is finally out of our lives. 
ARCHER Eve... 
He starts to say the words.  He wants, needs to share the truth with her.  But he can't.  Instead -- 
ARCHER ... If I had to do something to find some closure... I should do it, shouldn't I?... No matter how crazy? 
EVE Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again... 
ARCHER One last time.  And while I'm gone, I want you and Jamie to go to your mother's.  It's important... 
TITO Shoot me. (as Archer doesn't move) Shoot me! 
Tito pulls the gun against his own forehead. 
TITO You want to be Castor Troy?  If you hesitate for a breath, you're finished!  Now -- shoot me!  Kill me! 
Archer holds the gun unsteadily.  Tito is disgusted. 
TITO You can't do it... because Castor is tougher than you... 
BOOM!  The GUN goes off -- the slug tears past Tito's head.  Shocked, he touches his left ear, making sure it's still there. 
Then Tito looks at Archer -- and sees the determination. 
EXT. HOAG'S FACILITY - NIGHT 
Clear and calm.  God's night.  Someone's God anyway. 
INT. I.C.U. ROOM - NIGHT 
Hoag leads Archer to a full-length mirror. 
HOAG Let's see if I missed anything before I get my hands really dirty. 
Archer removes the robe.  He's amazed to see: 
His own head on Castor's body:  a flat stomach, hairy chest, tattoos, thinning hair, etc.  Hoag touches Archer's scar. 
HOAG You realize this has to be removed. (as Archer slowly nods) Then here we go, Commander. Through the Looking Glass... 
INT. SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT 
Unconscious, Archer is wheeled into the surgical bay, Castor beside him.  Hoag turns to the video technician. 
HOAG Make sure you get everything -- I'll need to study the tape before the reverse surgery. 
Hoag lowers an aerated Plexiglas mask over Archer's face. Interwoven with integrated laser circuitry -- this Derma- Induction-Device (D.I.D.) attaches via suction. 
Hoag sights through the optical memory, squeezes the trigger.  A cobalt beam cuts around the face -- cleanly slicing it.  Then Hoag lifts Archer's face -- off of his skull. 
Brodie and Miller watch from above.  Tito stumbles into the nearby bathroom to throw up. 
Hoag inspects Archer's face, then turns to his nurse. 
HOAG Vault it. 
Hoag turns to perform the same procedure on Castor. 
Castor's consistent EEG reading suddenly spikes radically -- for a moment, it almost seems to stabilize. Hoag glances over -- too late -- the spikes have disappeared. 
But the CAMERA CLOSES IN ON Castor's ear -- and we sense that, somehow, his auditory nerves might be functioning. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. RECOVERY ROOM - DAY 
A head swathed in gauze.  The bandages start to fall away. 
Tito, Miller and Brodie wait as Hoag removes the gauze. The patient looks into a mirror. 
Jon Archer has become Castor Troy. 
he touches his new face.  Archer stares... the cold reality chilling his blood. 
Archer buckles -- unprepared emotionally for what he's done to himself.  For a moment, he seems to teeter on madness. 
TITO Jon -- are you all right? 
Archer can't respond... he's somewhere the others can't comprehend.  Finally he emerges... shaken, but in control. 
TITO enters.  Instinctively, he grabs for his holster. 
ARCHER Okay... I'm okay. (realizes) But my voice... I still sound like me. 
HOAG I implanted a micro-chip onto your larynx. 
Hoag SWITCHES ON an AUDIO TAPE.  Archer repeats Castor's words as Hoag adjusts the chip with a wavelength box. 
CASTOR (V.O.)                  ARCHER Okay, I've got a               Okay, I've got a confession to make, but        confession to make, but you aren't gonna like          you aren't gonna like it... (etc.)                   it... (etc.) 
After a few repetitions, Archer's voice matches perfectly. 
Archer yawns, squints and furrows his brow -- testing every muscle.  He stares into the mirror -- into the eyes of his most hated enemy -- now his eyes.  Archer slowly turns to... 
Castor.  Motionless, swathed, dead to the world -- but something about Castor's smile -- that mocking smile... 
ARCHER Now what? 
TITO We're down to 72 hours.  Let's call Lazarro.  Castor Troy just came out of his coma. 
Castor dons his stern "Archer" face as the gate guard checks his thumbprint ID.  He's cleared and waved in. 
INT. FBI INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY 
Buzz and Wanda watch Pollux through the two-way mirror. He's gorging himself on a big lunch.  Castor arrives. 
BUZZ Listen, sir... we just want you to know... 
WANDA We're all really sorry about Tito... 
CASTOR Yeah, well, shit happens. 
Buzz and Wanda exchange a glance.  To them, "Archer" is just avoiding his feelings again. 
CASTOR How's our star witness? 
BUZZ He hasn't told us a damn thing except what kind of mustard he likes on his tongue sandwiches. 
WANDA If that bomb is out there -- we're almost out of time. 
LAZARRO (O.S.) Archer! 
Lazarro stomps toward them... furious.  Buzz and Wanda quickly excuse themselves. 
LAZARRO You made a deal with Pollux Troy? He's 'a manipulative psychopath.' Your own words, Jon! 
CASTOR Just let me do my job, Victor. 
LAZARRO The job I've been protecting for the last eight years.  From now on, you go strictly by the book. Everything gets cleared by me. Understand? 
Lazarro stomps off.  Castor watches him go, wheels turning. 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 
Castor enters -- shutting down the mikes... and the blinds. 
CASTOR You're supposed to be snitching -- making me look good. 
POLLUX 'Look good'? (drops food in disgust) Seeing that face -- I want to vomit. 
CASTOR I'm the one who has to look at this butt-ugly mug every time I pass a mirror.  Look at my eyes, my chin, my perfect nose -- gone! (considers his reflection) Archer took my life, so I'm taking his.  Bro, I'm going straight. 
POLLUX Sounds like they took your brain, too? 
CASTOR Imagine Dillinger as J. Edgar Hoover.  Carlos the Jackal running Interpol.  Kaddafi heading the Mossad.  Think of the secrets we could sell... 
Pollux listens carefully -- mind clicking like an abacus. 
POLLUX The drug agents we could expose. The movie stars we could blackmail! 
CASTOR That's just the bottom of the food chain.  Pollux -- what would happen if somebody planted a bomb on Air Force One? 
POLLUX ... that somebody would get rich. And, I suppose, the nation would be pretty pissed-off. 
CASTOR Pissed-off, vulnerable... looking for someone to step in, take charge, give them hope again. What if that someone was an F.B.I. hero?  A true Boy Scout and family man -- with a spotless past. Imagine where that guy could land -- if the timing's right. 
POLLUX It's an audacious dream, Caz.  But Jon Archer is hardly a household name. 
CASTOR Not yet he isn't.  But after you 'confess' -- you'll be a free man. And I'll be on my way... 
EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY 
Police VEHICLES ROAR into position.  Squads of police evacuate throngs of people. 
INT. CONVENTION CENTER - SUB-BASEMENT - EXTREME CLOSEUP - BOMB TIMER - DAY 
TICKS down to less than two minutes. 
Working as a unit, the BOMB SQUAD carefully remove the bomb's casing.  Inside, the complex guts glow evilly. The men are tense, cautious -- and way out of their league. 
BOMB LEADER Jesus... Any suggestions? 
TECHNICIAN Yeah... run 
Castor pushes up his blast visor.  He looks grim. 
BOMB LEADER It's protected by a vibration detector... One touch and... 
CASTOR Evacuate your team, Captain. 
BOMB LEADER Sir, you can't disarm it -- 
CASTOR Just go! 
The bomb squad hustles out.  Waiting until he's alone, Castor pulls a radio device from his pocket and hits its switch.  The bomb's glow dies instantly. 
EXTREME CLOSEUP - TIMER 
stops at 26 seconds. 
flares as Castor lights a candle.  The dining room table is set for a candlelight dinner.  He smiles warmly at her confusion. 
CASTOR Don't tell me you forgot.  Eve -- it's date night! 
DINING ROOM - LATER 
Eve looks up from her pasta.  After an awkward silence. 
EVE Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date? 
CASTOR It's important to keep some mystery... so things stay... unpredictable. 
Eve studies him as he pours her more wine.  Her smile slowly fades as she realizes what's going on. 
EVE 'Unpredictable'?  You're about as unpredictable as the tide. (detached) How long are you going to be gone this time? 
CASTOR Gone? 
EVE Isn't that what all this is about? The wine, cooking me dinner -- your next assignment? 
CASTOR I'm not going anywhere. 
EVE You always say that -- then you leave. 
CASTOR I bet I deserved that.  I bet Jon Archer is the most inattentive, sexless spouse on Earth. 
EVE Jon, that's not true -- 
CASTOR Of course it's true, but I'm trying to change?  I'm here because I want to be alone with you.  I want to see the candle- light dance in your beautiful -- 
Uh-oh.  Castor can't tell the color of Eve's eyes.  He leans in "romantically" -- but we know the real reason. 
CASTOR -- brown eyes. 
He smells her hair, then her shoulders, her skin.  She's aroused, but wary.  So Castor goes in for the kill. 
CASTOR I wanted it all to be just right... when I told you about my promotion. 
EVE Your what? 
CASTOR Well, I don't have it yet.  But Lazarro's getting old -- he won't be around forever.  And I'm getting the itch to move up. 
EVE Jon... that's wonderful. 
CASTOR So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you... 
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Castor carries Eve into the shower and spins on the water. 
He rips her blouse open -- on her like a vulture to carrion.  As they drop to the floor of the stall -- water filling up around them -- Castor licks her ear and whispers... 
CASTOR baby, it's like I'm having you for the first time. 
Dirty water runs down a floor drain... PULL BACK to: 
INT. EREWHON PRISON - POPULATION - NIGHT 
Desolate, Archer mops down the rec area. 
ARCHER Don't they ever let us take off these boots? 
VOISINE Not unless you're sent to the 'Clinic.' 
ARCHER You mean if I get sick? 
VOISINE They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Dubov just got sent down -- and look at Wainwright -- 
Voisine gestures to a dazed inmate nearby -- WAINWRIGHT -- who sits in a corner -- gnawing at his knuckles. 
VOISINE Toughest bastard I ever saw -- after you, of course.  Now he's a fucking drool case. 
ARCHER What did he do? 
VOISINE He hit a guard. 
Archer sees Walton hovering nearby.  Archer heads for him. 
WALTON Looking for trouble, Castor? 
ARCHER As a matter of fact -- yes. 
Crack!  Archer decks Walton. 
INT. PRISON - POPULATION - NIGHT 
Walton and a guard herd Archer toward a steel door. 
INT. "CLINIC" - NIGHT 
Archer and Dubov find themselves in a multi-level labyrinth.  A hundred feet high -- criss-crossed with catwalks, staircases and high walls. 
ECHOES resound -- SHOUTING, FOOTSTEPS GETTING CLOSER -- they seem to be coming from all around them. 
Over the magnetic HUM -- Archer notices loose screws and other metal debris stuck to the sheer wall.  He pulls one screw away -- and lets it fly back into the polarized wall. 
Archer gets an idea -- and looks back the way they came. 
SMASH CUT: 
SHEER WALL 
Archer and Dubov scale the face -- using the old metal boots.  They climb higher and higher as... 
Guards criss-cross the catwalks and staircases below and around them -- oblivious. 
Archer and Dubov almost reach the next level when... 
WALTON There! 
BULLETS SMACK the wall around them -- just as Archer and Dubov reach the next catwalk. 
Archer spots the emergency exit security door at the far end.  But four guards descend on them -- and block their way. 
Fist fight as Archer and Dubov take on the attacking guards.  Archer heaves one down the stairs -- into more guards.  Dubov drops another over the catwalk. 
They continue their desperate race for the door -- reaching the landing.  As BULLETS PING around them -- hulking Dubov rips away a floor panel.  He uses it as a shield as Archer sparks up Walton's lighter. 
As SLUGS EXPLODE into the shield -- Archer places the flame to his thumb... and peels off the skin mold. 
He presses his thumb to the door's keypad.  To his horror, its LED reads "print unreadable." 
Walton and guards movie in, FIRING at closer and closer range. 
Dubov staggers under the FUSILLADE OF BULLETS.  The shield is repeatedly punctured -- and is quickly disintegrating. 
Archer licks his thumb, tries again.  Finally it reads "Clearance Confirmed"... the door slides open. 
ARCHER Let's go! 
Dubov heaves the shield at the encroaching guards -- but as he turns to follow... Walton BLOWS him away. 
Archer reaches to pull Dubov through, but the riddled inmate ignores the helping hand.  Pulling the door shut, he collapses in front of it -- blocking it momentarily. 
INT. HIGH CATWALK TOWER 
Archer hesitates for a moment... but that's all he has. he keeps going... up the winding staircase-catwalk -- higher and higher -- a step ahead of the onrushing guards. 
As BULLETS CLANG around him -- Archer reaches the top. He ignores a sign which reads... 
EMERGENCY EXIT ONLY SAFETY LINES REQUIRED 
He charges straight up a ladder and plows right through -- 
SMASH CUT: 
EXT. PRISON - DAWN 
Archer's blinded -- it's daytime in the real world. 
A sea gull flies across his face -- as we FOLLOW the bird... 
PULL WAY, WAY BACK to reveal: 
The prison's in the middle of the goddamn ocean, in what appears to be just an abandoned, rusty oil rig platform. 
Archer rushes over to a transport chopper. 
INSIDE COCKPIT 
Archer searches for the keys.  No go.  He throws switches.  Nothing works. 
Guards pour out of the hatch -- FIRING.  Archer leaps from the chopper and jumps over the side to the platform's -- 
LOWER LEVEL 
He lands hard on the slanted, corrugated shed roof and rolls to the ground.  He grabs a high-pressure hose -- and cranks the pressure valve -- as the pursuing guards close in. 
Archer BLASTS the guards with the WATER CANNON -- knocking Walton and others into the sea.  Archer upends a stack of oil barrels -- which roll into more guards. Archer spots: 
TUGBOAT 
pulling a Zodiac dinghy -- heading out to sea. 
Archer jumps up a stack of pipes to the south rail -- where the end of a crane's hook is tagged back.  Under FIRE -- Archer frees the hook, which swings away from the platform. 
Hanging on to the hook, it swings him out over the ocean. At the apex -- le lets go and plummets down into... 
CHOPPY SEA 
EXT. ST. MARY'S CEMETERY - DAY 
It's beautiful here, striking and sad.  Now on foot, Castor follows Eve up a bluff, through a phalanx of graves -- with no idea where she's leading him. 
Finally she stops at a crucifix-topped headstone.  Castor joins her and reads the etched marble stone: 
Matthew Archer, Age 5 Beloved Son & Brother We Cherish You Always 
Stunned, Castor watches as Eve kneels beside the marker. 
EVE Happy birthday, Matty. 
She places a few child's toys on the marker... a shark... a little bulldozer... a spaceship.  Overwhelmed with grief, she collapses into Castor. 
EVE He took our baby, Jon.  He took our little boy. 
FULL SCREEN - CASTOR'S FACE 
He stares at the grave of the boy he killed -- the boy whose mother is weeping into his chest. 
The ever-present smirk is long gone as Castor stiffly returns Eve's embrace -- maybe, just maybe, feeling the victim's pain. 
CASTOR Stop crying... stop crying... stop ... 
INT. FBI BULLPEN - DAY 
Shaking off his funk, Castor arrives at the office. 
WANDA You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off! 
CASTOR What happened? 
WANDA Castor's dead! 
CASTOR He's -- what? 
BUZZ Somehow he escaped from Erewhon. But a prison chopper mowed him down just off Long Beach Harbor... 
CASTOR Where's the body? 
WANDA It hasn't been recovered yet. 
CASTOR 'It hasn't been recovered yet!' You people have no idea who you're dealing with! (beat) I want everyone on this, reports on the half hour, and all leads get routed through my office. Buzz, alert the L.A.P.D. 
BUZZ L.A.P.D.?  Even if he is alive, Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city. 
CASTOR He's alive -- and he's already here.  Move! 
EXT. PIER - NIGHT 
Something bobs up in the surf.  Archer is thrashed ashore by the breakers... he crawls gasping onto the sand.  He takes a few breaths -- then staggers up onto the beach. 
EXT. TITO'S STREET - NIGHT 
Archer's heart sinks as he sees the yellow police cordon taped across Tito's front door.  Some teenage cholos notice him -- so Archer keeps right on going. 
INT. TITO'S DUPLEX - NIGHT 
A rear window is forced open -- Archer pulls himself in. In the dim light, he sees the bullet hole on the wall... then the blood stains within the forensics chalk marks. 
He buckles and has to sit down.  Taking a deep breath, he picks up the phone and dials. 
ARCHER Dr. Archer please.   It's an emergency. (listens) -- Her husband. 
Archer waits.  He pinches his throat -- trying to dislodge the vocal implant.  His voice scrambles into garbled static. 
ARCHER Hello, Eve -- I know this sounds crazy, but -- (reverting back) Dammit. 
INT. HOSPITAL - ER - NIGHT 
EVE deftly stitches up a gash above little IRIS's (8) eye. 
EVE How did this happen, sweetie? 
IRIS'S DAD She fell off her Big-Wheel. 
Something about his too-quick response rankles Eve.  She eyes the yuppy Dad with suspicion -- then notes some bruises on the child's arm.  A NURSE enters. 
NURSE Dr. Archer -- your husband's on three. 
EVE Get Child Services down here -- and don't let her father leave. (goes to wall-phone) Jon?  Hello? 
INTERCUT Archer and Eve as necessary. 
ARCHER Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't. 
EVE Who is this? 
ARCHER Please, just listen!  Take Jamie and go to your mother's in Santa Fe.  Don't tell him where you're going -- just go. 
DIETRICH That's my other curse. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN - LOFT - NIGHT (LATER) 
Cars pull up in front of a gentrified loft amid the low- rent streets. 
Emerging from them are several thugs -- including Aldo, Fitch and their sexy girl friends, LIVIA and Cindee. 
INT. DIETRICH'S LOFT - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Archer splashes water on his face -- then stops and listens as the DOORBELL RINGS.  He screws up his courage. 
ARCHER You're Castor Troy... This is your old crew -- you don't take shit and you don't take no for an answer... 
INT. DIETRICH'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
The thugs admire the loft -- dominated by an enormous, in-progress mural and stunning glass-bricked floor. 
ALDO Helluva place, Dietrich.  So what's the big surprise? 
Archer emerges.  The men are stunned -- the women beam. 
FITCH Are you crazy?  You're going to bring the Feds down on all of us! 
ARCHER Archer doesn't want you, he wants me!  But I'm going to get him first -- with your help. 
ALDO Archer's a damn celebrity now -- he's untouchable -- and you're radioactive. 
He turns to leave.  Archer wheels him around and smashes him into the wall.  Aldo goes for his gun, but Archer's too quick -- he strips him of it. 
The four bodyguards draw their weapons -- and surround Archer. 
ARCHER You wanna face-off with Castor Troy?  Come on, then!  Come on! 'Cause I've had a real bad day... 
Four against one -- and everyone's sweating but Archer. One-by-one, the bodyguards back off.  Archer points the gun at Aldo -- then smiles and hands it back. 
ARCHER You're all forgetting who the real enemy is. (to Aldo) Six months ago, Jon Archer hauled you in for questioning.  He rattled you so bad -- you shit your Armani suit right there in the interrogation room. 
Aldo blanches -- how did Castor know that?  Fitch laughs. 
ARCHER You laugh, Fitch -- the way Archer laughed at your last arraignment, when you got down on your knees and tried to blow your way to freedom. 
Stunned, Fitch cringes as everybody cracks up. 
DIETRICH We all have a reason to hate Jon Archer.  We all want to see him dead -- 
ARCHER And nobody's untouchable if we say he's not. 
The thugs exchange a glance... reading each other... considering. 
DIETRICH It's all worked out.  Caz has Archer's routine down cold. 
ARCHER We start with your basic kidnapping.  Then -- a little surgery. 
FITCH Surgery? 
ARCHER I'm going to rearrange his face in a way you won't believe. 
ALDO You're an evil bitch, Caz.  But you've got balls of titanium. Count us in. 
Archer sighs with relief -- pleased with his performance. 
DIETRICH Come on -- let's drink to it! 
FULL SCREEN - BLUE CAPSULE 
Dietrich cracks it open -- powder sifts into a big high- ball glass filled with mescal.  he hands it to Archer. 
DIETRICH How about one of your famous toasts, Caz? 
They all look expectantly at Archer... he's at a loss. 
ARCHER To old jobs, new jobs and -- uh -- blow jobs? 
Silence -- then they crack up.  Reluctantly, Archer swallows the tumbler of mescal... he fights back the urge to puke. 
LIVIA Enough business, Caz.  Let's dance. 
ARCHER Sorry... I don't... 
She drags him onto the glass floor.  Cindee puts on some MUSIC as Archer's head begins to spin.  The girls start "dancing," grinding Archer between their taut bodies.  He tries to avoid it, but Livia kisses him -- hot, moist. 
LIVIA Remember the Charger's game, Caz? The owners box?  We did it four times. 
ARCHER Sure I remember... Once a quarter, right? 
Archer's eyes fall on the series of abstract paintings. 
The twisted renderings make his head spin worse... as he starts to hallucinate... surrounded by enemies -- he struggles to regain control of his battered psyche. 
SASHA Take off the rest of those rags and get dressed.  Then get out. 
ARCHER Not until I finish my business with your brother. 
SASHA I told him to keep those creeps away -- but you're just too big an attraction. (calming herself) Look, if the F.B.I. finds out you've been here -- I'll lose my son.  So please, just go. 
For the first time, Archer sees not a hardened felon -- but a frightened, protective mother.  And he realizes the effect his own relentless obsession has had on her. 
ARCHER I know I've done some things that made your life harder... 
SASHA How would you?  You walked out and never looked back. 
ADAM enters, heading for his toys -- his presence cooling Sasha's deep-seated anger.  Archer finishes dressing. 
ARCHER I'm not the same person you remember.  And for what it's worth, I'm sorry... 
Her harsh look softens imperceptively -- like that of a woman trying to hate someone she still loves. 
ARCHER Not a bad fit. 
SASHA They should.  They're yours. 
ARCHER Nice-looking kid, too 
SASHA Of course he is... 
Sasha fidgets, struggling with a deep inner turmoil. Then... 
SASHA Adam, come here... I want you to meet your father. 
Archer's face pales over in shock. 
EXT. SASHA'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Their silhouettes are visible against the shades. 
PULL BACK... 
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
Castor, Buzz, Wanda and Loomis peer at the silhouettes. 
CASTOR (into cellular) We've got him sighted.  Okay, Pollux, pull out. 
BUZZ What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother? 
CASTOR I've never been more certain of anything.  Get everyone in position.  Remember -- shoot to kill. 
Before Buzz can object, Castor's eyes say "don't argue." 
BUZZ You heard the man -- let's saddle up! 
INT. SASHA'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Playing with his toys, Adam does not see Archer's icy gaze. 
ARCHER How old is he? 
SASHA Five.  No one knows you're his father.  I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you... 
ADAM Bang!  Bang!  Bang! 
Startled, they turn to see Adam pointing a toy gun at them.  Upset, she takes it from his hands. 
SASHA You know Mommy doesn't like you playing with these things... 
She kicks the toy aside and lifts Adam -- offering him to Archer.  Awkwardly, Archer takes the boy. 
Archer's emotions avalanche as his grip tightens -- his big hands dwarfing the little boy's body. 
SASHA You're not holding him right... Caz... 
Archer isn't hearing Sasha.  He's lost in his own memory... the sound of a CAROUSEL... a KID'S LAUGHTER... a GUNSHOT... 
Then Adam smiles -- perhaps the way Matthew once smiled. It pulls something up from inside Archer -- something strong.  He regains control, dumping the child into Sasha's arms. 
ARCHER He's not my son. 
SASHA Yes, he is -- ! 
Then something alerts Archer -- maybe the fleeting shadows that blot out the window-light for the barest second. 
ARCHER Get down! 
K-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM!  The WINDOW PANES SHATTER -- as TEARGAS GRENADES and GUNFIRE riddles the loft. 
OUTSIDE 
across the way, Castor directs the FIREPOWER. 
Agents and thugs FIRE blindly upward and downward through the floor -- desperate to hit their targets. 
Agents open FIRE from the girders supporting the roof -- cutting down Fitch's last bodyguard. 
DIETRICH They're like cockroaches! 
Dietrich and Livia toss SMOKE GRENADES into the loft -- covering their escape. 
TOP LEVEL 
Dietrich leads them to the very back of the loft.  He pulls open a hidden door. 
DIETRICH If we make it, we'll meet up at my Malibu place.  You remember it, Caz? 
ARCHER Off Kanan Road -- I know it. 
Archer hands Adam over to Sasha.  She hugs her little boy -- then embraces Archer tightly.  Hanging on -- near tears -- because she knows this may be the last time. 
SASHA Thank you, Caz... thank you... 
ARCHER Get the boy out of here... 
Livia and the remaining bodyguard hustle Archer out -- 
INT. ROTUNDA - NIGHT 
MAC-10 poised, Livia and the bodyguard rush Archer through the deserted rotunda -- BOOM!  BOOM!  His escorts drop. 
Castor rushes down the staircase -- BLASTING at Archer. Unarmed, Archer instantly disappears behind one of the eight columns.  The columns are separated by mirrored- panels. 
Cat-and-mouse as Castor slips in and out between column and mirror.  He spots Archer dead-ahead and BLASTS away! 
CRASH!  The MIRROR SHATTERS into a thousand pieces. 
ARCHER (O.S.) That's about a thousand years bad luck... 
Castor whirls, spots Archer again and FIRES!  Another MIRROR.  Sensing Archer behind him -- Castor turns and FIRES again -- this time BLASTING away his OWN REFLECTION. 
Then Archer leaps through a shattered mirror frame -- and onto Castor.  They battle for control of the pistol. 
CASTOR It's too late, Jon.  Your kid loves me.  And your wife's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her. 
They're so close Castor's whispering right in Archer's ear. 
CASTOR Tonight I'm going to make her come like Niagara Falls -- to celebrate your death. 
Castor licks Archer's ear salaciously.  Enraged, Archer tears the pistol from his grip and turns it on Castor. 
He's got Castor dead to rights -- suddenly BULLETS SHRED the world around him.  Archer staggers away as -- 
Loomis enters -- FIRING his M-16 as Archer dives for a doorway.  Loomis FIRES the M-16's grenade launcher. 
BOOM!  The GRENADE EXPLODES -- the doorway bursts into flames -- but Archer has made it through. 
Loomis tries to help up Castor -- who pushes him off angrily.  Castor can't follow through the flames. 
EXT. ROOF - NIGHT 
Archer slams out of the interior stairwell -- but BULLETS force him to take cover behind the cupola. 
Pollux FIRES at him from the other side. 
Archer RETURNS FIRE -- driving Pollux back.  Stand-off. 
POLLUX Remember me?  Your 'baby brother'? 
Trying to get the drop, Pollux carefully crawls onto the top of the cupola. 
POLLUX You tricked me into telling you things I never told anyone... 
Archer hears movement above him as Pollux reaches the crown. 
POLLUX Now take it to your grave. 
Archer FIRES his PISTOL -- into the glass cupola -- and SHATTERS the GLASS beneath Pollux's feet.  The cupola disintegrates beneath his weight.  He plunges down into -- 
ROTUNDA 
Castor watches in horror as Pollux pancakes onto the floor at his feet. 
CASTOR Pollux... 
Pollux is almost gone.  Castor looks up and sees -- 
ARCHER 
Peering down into the rotunda. 
CASTOR 
Mayhem as others join in... clerks rush out to do battle. 
An LAPD squad car hauls up onto the curb.  A cop leaps out and chases as the looters scatter. 
The driver stands at his door, radio in hand.  Sensing something, he turns... just as Archer grabs the canister of Comply-Gas from the cop's belt. 
Archer sprays him in the face.  The cop gags and sags. Archer quickly slips behind the wheel. 
Inside:  Archer hits a switch -- the car's tinted windows darken automatically, obscuring him from the outside.  He HITS the GAS -- SCREAMING away. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Archer slows the squad car. 
Up ahead:  Parked cop cars block both lanes of the main road -- a roadblock checkpoint for all traffic. 
Archer pulls off the road, out of sight.  He flips open the portacomp and starts to type rapidly. 
INT. FBI - DAY 
A DISPATCHER'S SCANNER CLICKS to life. 
DISPATCHER All units.  I have a confirmed code zero-zero priority alert. Proceed at once to Parthenia Street Terminal.  That's Parthenia at Nordhoff. 
QUICK SHOTS 
A)  MOTOR POOL 
Tac squads pile into armored Jeeps. 
B)  HELIPORT 
Choppers lift off and veer east. 
C)  ARCHER'S HOUSE 
The surveillance CARS ROAR away. 
EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY 
Archer watches as the checkpoint of cop cars pulls apart and screams east on the main road -- passing Archer. Once the armada is gone, he pulls out and heads west. 
EXT. ARCHER HOME - BACK YARD - DAY 
A plank in the fence swings aside as Archer slips into the yard.  He peers out from behind the garage. 
A cop sits in a lawn chair, tuning a POLICE-BAND RADIO. 
Archer approaches the bird feeder.  Quietly, he sticks his hand inside -- and searches for the key. 
Just when he grabs it -- CAW-CAW -- an annoying BLUEBIRD hovers over Archer.  The cop looks over -- but Archer is gone.  All Lars sees is the bird. 
INT. FBI - BULLPEN - DAY 
Castor arrives.  Wanda is shocked to see him. 
WANDA Commander, what are you doing here? 
CASTOR Where should I be? (looks around) Where's everyone else? 
WANDA Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Parthenia Street Terminal? 
CASTOR What? 
WANDA You radioed in your personal security code.  Nobody knows that code but you. 
CASTOR Obviously someone else knows it! Get everybody back to their posts -- now! 
INT. ARCHER HOME - SUNSET 
Archer tiptoes through the house -- listening.  He sees Cop #2 sitting at the dining room table, cleaning his pistol.  He slips upstairs -- toward the sound of RUNNING WATER. 
MASTER BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Archer walks in and steps toward the bathroom -- passing the bed.  He stops.  On top of the rumpled covers:  Eve's nightgown and a pair of Castor's black briefs. 
Overwhelmed, he sits down -- not noticing the water has stopped.  Eve steps in from the bathroom. 
ARCHER Eve... 
The look of horror on her face snaps him back to reality. She runs, but Archer grabs her.  She struggles -- fighting and kicking him -- but somehow he keeps her mouth covered. 
ARCHER I'm not going to hurt you.  Just don't scream, okay? (no response) Okay? 
Terrified -- she finally nods and he eases off her. 
EVE I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son -- 
ARCHER -- I called, but I'm not Castor. I'm your husband. 
EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
Nothing happening here at 4 A.M.  Nothing indeed.  The bored Cop keeps watch outside -- as Eve hustles in. 
INT. HOSPITAL - EVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Eve paces anxiously as the BLOOD ANALYZER CLICKS away. 
EVE Please be O-neg.  Please... 
The MACHINE STOPS CLICKING.  It reads "Male -- Type AB." She buries her face in her hands -- completely stunned. 
ARCHER (O.S.) Thanks for believing me. 
Archer emerges from the darkness of her office -- but Eve pulls a pistol -- aiming it with calm authority. 
ARCHER What are you doing?  Where did you get that gun? 
EVE I took it from my fake husband. 
ARCHER Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing. 
EVE I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead. 
ARCHER What more proof do you need? 
EVE Tell me... tell me about the all- night dentist. 
As Archer speaks -- Eve searches his eyes for the truth. 
ARCHER ... I took a date out for chicken and ribs -- not knowing she was a vegetarian.  When the night couldn't get worse, she broke her tooth on a pebble that got into her three-bean salad Somehow she and I had fun driving around looking for an all-night dentist... (a beat) And even though it must have hurt -- you still kissed me. 
Eve slowly puts the gun down, fighting off tears. 
EVE Christ, Jon!  How could you put us in this position?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me...? 
ARCHER Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you -- 
She pulls herself together -- regaining her composure. 
EVE But you're damn well going to try. (a beat) First -- how are we going to get you out of this? 
INT. ARCHER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Castor wakes up and finds Eve gone.  His eyes narrow as he touches the mosquito bite -- the one that isn't there. 
INT. HOSPITAL - EVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Eve sifts through the supply cabinet and finds a yellow vial. 
EVE This will knock him out for hours. 
ARCHER Good.  What's his schedule tomorrow? 
EVE He doesn't tell me anymore than you ever did... All I know is -- tomorrow we're going to Victor's memorial service. 
ARCHER Victor... Tito... they both died thinking I killed them... And in a way... I did. 
EVE Jon -- you can't think about that now. 
Archer takes a breath -- and pulls himself together. 
ARCHER -- What happens after the memorial? 
EVE He's taking Jamie and me away. 
ARCHER And neither of you will be coming back.  Where's the service? 
EVE Saint Mary's-By-The-Sea. 
Archer reacts... the irony's not lost on him. 
EVE What are you going to do? 
ARCHER Hit him with a trank dart.  Once he's unconscious -- I'll try to get to Buzz and Wanda before the security team gets to me. 
EVE What else can I do? 
ARCHER Think up a good excuse.  I don't want you or Jamie anywhere near that service. 
EVE I can cover for Jamie.  But if I'm not there, he'll suspect something... (as Archer considers) The second you make your move, all hell's going to break loose.  If I'm there beside him -- I can take charge.  I'm his wife, remember? (a beat) There's no way around it -- for once, you need me. 
Archer looks into her eyes -- the regrets flooding over. 
ARCHER I've always needed you... 
They embrace... soaking up each other's warmth. 
EVE Jon -- what are the odds? 
EXT. SEA-SIDE - DAY 
At the foot of the cemetery knoll.  Rows of chairs... white flowers... mourners.  A yacht is docked at the breakwater. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
ARCHER'S POV THROUGH SCOPE 
peers down through scope -- seeing... 
Castor and Eve as they emerge from their limo. 
Eve glances around, searching for Archer.  She comes eye- to-eye with Lars -- who is watching her every move. 
Archer TRACKS Castor and Eve as they sit in the front row.  The ceremony begins. 
PRIEST We are here to celebrate the life of Victor Lazarro.  We all know him as a man who dedicated himself to defending this great nation -- first, as a highly decorated admiral -- then, as west coast director of the F.B.I.  But not all of you know what a deeply spiritual man he was.  It was his wish that his Requiem Mass be performed in Latin. (a beat) In Nomine Patris, et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.  Amen... 
The PRIEST begins to recite a beautiful and somber mass. 
ARCHER 
fills the trank-dart with sedative. 
PRIEST 
continues the solemn ritual. 
PRIEST Domine, de morte aeterna, in die illa tremenda quando caeli movendi sunt et terra... 
EVE 
checks her watch... barely lifting her eyes away... 
Castor absently pats her knee.  She's forced to return focus to the service. 
ARCHER 
chambers the dart, twists a knob on the range-finder, and carefully peers over the crucifix. 
THROUGH SCOPE 
Archer TRACKS THROUGH the mourners -- and FINDS Castor. As the cross-hairs neatly cube his head... 
BACK TO SCENE 
We've come full circle from Matthew's death:  with Archer the sniper and Castor the target. 
The Priest's emotional reciting of the rites climaxes. 
PRIEST Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine... Amen. 
FULL SCREEN - TRIGGER 
Archer's finger wraps around -- he starts to squeeze... 
POV THROUGH SCOPE - FIGURE 
crosses behind Castor, blocking Archer's shot.  Archer's finger freezes -- as the figure turns -- hair tumbling away from her face.  It's Jamie. 
AT SERVICE 
Eve stiffens as Jamie sits down. 
JAMIE Thanks anyway, Mom -- (slides her $50) But I wanted to be here for you... and Dad. 
Castor reads the panic on Eve's face, but says nothing. 
He simply takes Jamie's hand, intertwining his fingers in hers. 
The honor guard steps forward, shouldering their rifles, commencing their 21-GUN SALUTE as -- 
ARCHER 
steadies himself, re-aims the sniper rifle. 
He hears MOTION behind him.  Someone's coming and fast... but this is his only chance.  Off-balance, Archer squeezes -- 
THFFFT!  The SILENCED TRANK-DART explodes from the barrel. 
FOLLOW DART 
Screaming toward Castor's neck -- but it goes just wide. It sinks harmlessly into the grass -- unnoticed during the 21-GUN SALUTE. 
ON KNOLL 
THUMP!  Archer is cracked across the head.  He slumps down, unconscious, as a silenced gun barrel gently enters his ear.  As the saluting GUNS FIRE in the b.g. -- we don't know when, or if, this pistol fires... 
AT SEA-SIDE SERVICE 
Aldo aims at Castor when BOOM!  He's blown apart. 
Lars charges in -- BLASTING. 
Archer grabs a block-and-tackle as -- 
Lunt dives for Aldo's fallen machine-pistol.  Archer swings the block-and-tackle -- whacking Lunt across the head. 
Castor scoops up his pistol but Eve kicks him hard in the balls.  He doubles over. 
Archer snatches away the MACHINE PISTOL.  Staggered -- Lunt is quickly riddled by Dietrich. 
Castor and Lars BLAZE at the now-scattering intruders -- driving them back amid the shot's tools and drums. 
ARCHER Find Jamie! 
Eve crawls through the FUSILLADE toward the exit. 
EXT. MEMORIAL SERVICE - DAY 
Among the last to leave -- Buzz and Wanda snap alert. Over the CRASHING of the WAVES -- did Wanda hear something? 
EXT. BOATHOUSE - DAY 
Eve rushes to the car -- it's empty.  Jamie is gone. 
EVE Jamie?  Jamie! 
BULLETS SHRED the WINDOWS behind her. 
INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY 
During the GUN BATTLE -- we INTERCUT the deaths of Dietrich, Lars and Sasha WITH: 
EXT. SEA - LAZARRO'S ASHES 
being scattered at sea. 
Castor and Lars RIDDLE Sasha.  She drops.  Archer FIRES back -- killing Lars and driving Castor back. 
Archer leans beside the mortally-wounded Sasha. 
SASHA ... Help Adam... don't let him end up like us... 
She dies in his arms.  Wounded, Dietrich crawls over. Seeing his sister, Dietrich rises in horror... 
DIETRICH Sasha -- ! 
BOOM BOOM BOOM!  Castor wastes Dietrich.  Archer BLASTS back -- driving Castor outside.  Archer pursues. 
EXT. MEMORIAL SERVICE - DAY 
Eve runs smack into Wanda and Buzz -- they're on the run. 
WANDA We heard gunshots -- 
EVE Wanda, I've got to tell you something.  Something crazy... 
EXT. BOATHOUSE YARD - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY 
Archer emerges into the maze of dry-docked boats. Silently checking his clip, he discards the empty gun. 
Castor moves stealthily through the narrow paths. Hearing a NOISE behind him -- 
BOOM!  Castor FIRES -- blowing apart an under-repair hull.  He advances toward the boat, gun ready, when Archer appears behind him and follows -- one step, two steps -- until -- 
Castor stops -- then whirls as Archer leaps. 
The men collapse hard.  Castor's pistol clatters across the yard toward the docked boat. 
Archer and Castor brutally strangle each other -- digging their fingers deep into their throats.  They throttle each other so hard, Archer's larynx vocal chip is dislodged. 
His VOICE CHANGES, ECHOING with garbled.  STATIC. 
ARCHER Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out. 
CASTOR Not if I kill you first. 
They scramble for the gun -- but a hand reaches out from the docked boat and picks it up.  Archer and Castor stop dead in their tracks because -- 
Jamie appears, holding the pistol. 
CASTOR Give it here, Jamie. 
ARCHER No, Jamie.  Don't do it! 
Everybody gawks -- because Archer and Castor are now... 
Both speaking in Archer's true voice. 
ARCHER 
FIRES UP the second BOAT -- in pursuit.  Castor BLASTS back -- SHATTERING Archer's BOAT COMPASS. 
CIVILIAN BOAT 
speeds toward him -- causing a near-miss. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Running parallel, Archer and Castor BLAST at EACH OTHER at point-blank range.  Their boats smash and pound each other. 
A police boat closes in on them. 
Castor FIRES at the police -- obliterating both crew and boat.  The POLICE BOAT'S rear SMASHES into Archer's craft. 
Archer's BOAT plows up and through the other.  EXPLOSION! Momentum carries Archer across -- and back into the water. 
The boat lands right next to Castor's. 
Archer and Castor resume their battering... approaching a -- 
TUG 
pulling a barge. 
Castor forces Archer into its path.  At the last moment... 
Archer leaps onto the bow of Castor's boat as -- 
KA-BOOM!  Archer's boat crashes into the BARGE which EXPLODES. 
CASTOR 
swerves wildly -- trying to throw Archer off. 
Archer can only watch as Castor reaches for another clip. 
But the boat hits a wave... 
Castor loses the gun -- which skids away.  Archer slips, his head hanging over the side.  Castor tries to ram Archer, but he pulls himself up just in time. 
Castor grabs the anchor -- swings it.  WHUNK!  It sinks into the deck beside Archer -- but the chain is around his neck. 
As Castor tries to strangle him -- Archer headbutts Castor, who reels -- snagging his leg around the chain. Castor falls back -- plunging toward the water. 
Archer tries to hold Castor up... as the boat speeds toward -- 
PIER 
Archer yanks Castor back onto the deck as the BOAT BOUNCES OFF the pier pilings.  But as they slug it out... 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
WHAM!  The BOAT careens off a piling -- and ROARS straight for the shipyard.  COLLIDING with a shoreline obstruction -- 
The BOAT FLIPS, stern over bow... 
Archer and Castor go flying... onto the beach. 
EXT. BEACH - DAY 
Archer and Castor lie dazed... then stir.  Castor sees the pistol lying half-buried... he reaches for it. But -- 
Archer gets it first.  He aims it at Castor as they rise. 
CASTOR You won't shoot me, Jon.  I'm unarmed... 
ARCHER Okay, I have a confession to make... but you aren't gonna like it... You're right, I won't shoot you.  Not in the face anyway. 
BOOM -- Archer SHOOTS Castor in the chest!  He jerks and reels -- dropping to his knees.  He looks at Archer in total disbelief.  Then he sinks to the ground and lies still. 
Exhausted, Archer lets the empty gun drop.  Then he turns and sees an FBI chopper heading his way.  Relieved, he turns back to Castor, but -- Castor's body is gone! 
Castor is crawling toward the flipped boat's spinning stabilizing screw.  Archer FIRES -- hitting Castor in the leg.  He buckles... but keeps going. 
Archer leaps on him -- they struggle as Castor tries to bury his face on the spinning blade. 
CASTOR It'll never be over, Jon... every time you look in the mirror... you'll see my face... 
They struggle as the propeller blade. gets closer, closer -- slicing into "Archer's" cheek.  At the last instant... 
Archer reaches the anchor-chain.  He wraps it around the screw -- stopping the whirling blades. 
Castor finally sinks to the ground -- and no longer moves. 
Archer takes Castor's hand -- trying to tug off his wedding ring.  Just when he almost has it off -- Castor suddenly grabs Archer's wrist and holds it tight. 
Eye contact between the two men.  Castor smirks, his grasp slackening... as he finally fades away.  Archer lets Castor's hand drop, then slides the ring on his own finger.

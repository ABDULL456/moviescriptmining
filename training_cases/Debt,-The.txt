1   INT. CARGO PLANE. MILITARY AIRBASE. ISRAEL - DAY              1 
A strange ROARING sound... 
CLOSE ON A YOUNG WOMAN 
...in darkness. Light begins to spill on her from the right - revealing her face, lost in thought. This is RACHEL SINGER - pretty, painfully young looking. A surgical dressing covers half her face. 
As we pull back a little we see that two YOUNG MEN sit either side of her. They are STEPHAN GOLD (thirties) thick- set, capable, and DAVID PERETZ (late twenties), dark-haired and pale-faced. 
The three faces in the darkness, each looking straight ahead - something from a Caravaggio painting. 
The roaring, which we realise is the sound of ENGINES, gradually runs down into silence. 
The light from the bay door which is opening off-screen begins to flood the scene with HARSH DAYLIGHT, revealing the inside of a CARGO PLANE. 
Stephan turns to look at the growing light. Then he turns to Rachel. 
STEPHAN Breathe. 
He stands. Rachel turns to look at David but he is standing too, his face a mask. Rachel gathers herself, then stands and turns to follow the other two, walking towards the light. 
As the three approach the opening and descend the ramp of the bay door, we hear a woman's voice: 
SARAH (V.O) We should never forget how young they were. 
EXT. AIRBASE RUNWAY. ISRAEL - DAY 
TRACKING THE THREE 
...as they walk across the tarmac - first Stephan... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   2. 
SARAH (V.O.)(CONT'D) My father, Stephan Gold, was the youngest Unit Commander in Mossad. 
David is next... 
SARAH (V.O.)(CONT'D) David Peretz had his twenty-ninth birthday while on the mission. 
Then Rachel. 
SARAH (V.O.)(CONT'D) My mother was even younger. Only twenty-five. 
RACHEL'S P.O.V 
Silhouetted against the bright light is a group of waiting MILITARY and MOSSAD DIGNITARIES. Their hands are raised in applause. 
SARAH (V.O.) (CONT'D) Despite their youth they'd had the courage to confront an unimaginable evil.... 
The three walk towards their welcoming party. Rachel blinks against the sunlight, takes out a pair of sunglasses and slips them on.

CLOSE ON OLDER RACHEL 
...now 56. Handsome, impeccably groomed. A long crooked SCAR runs down one side of her face. 
SARAH (O.S) ...a man whose sadistic experiments left thousands disfigured or dead, who became known by a name which defiles the annals of medicine: The Surgeon of Birkenau. 
She's wearing tinted glasses, staring at us, listening to Sarah speak. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   3. 
REVERSE 
Rachel's daughter - SARAH - stands at a podium, reading the Dedication to a rather large audience who have come for the launch of her first book. 
She's 31, and clearly her mother's daughter. 
The cover image from the book is projected on a screen behind Sarah - a black and white photograph of a young Rachel, David and Stephan. Above their faces, the title - In Our Hands. 
SARAH Their mission had been to return him to Israel to stand trial. Instead it ended with his death on the streets of East Berlin...

CLOSE ON YOUNG RACHEL 
...as she waits behind David and Stephan, face bleached out by the sunlight. She stares at the ground. 
SARAH (V.O.) But this was not what was celebrated. It was their youth itself that became a symbol. Here were the children who had faced Israel's greatest nightmare, her greatest pain... David and Stephan have moved out of shot and Rachel reaches the DIGNITARIES. Still looking down, she manages a smile, a bob of her head, reaches out to shake the first hand...

A celebratory dinner for the book launch is in progress - publishers, journalists, local dignitaries... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   7. 
Rachel is re-joining the table, taking her place beside her daughter amidst the dinner party chatter. Sarah watches her. 
SARAH When are you going to stop? 
RACHEL Stop what? 
SARAH The smoking. 
RACHEL Soon. 
SARAH I hope so. Do it for your grandson. 
SARAH Are you sure you have to go back home tomorrow? 
RACHEL It's all arranged, I'm afraid... 
SARAH But we'll have breakfast before you go? I thought maybe we could take a walk on the beach? (Trying to sound casual) I'd like you to see more of him. 
A WAITER leans over with WINE for Rachel. She covers her glass. RACHEL (To Sarah, ill-at-ease) Well, I'll be back. We can...maybe in the holidays or... 
MIRIAM, a PUBLISHER appears at her shoulder with a copy of Sarah's book. 
MIRIAM I've marked the place. I thought perhaps from chapter eleven...? 
RACHEL ...Yes, thank you. 
Rachel nods absently, flicking through the pages of the book. Sarah realizes, with a small stab of pain, that she has no idea what that means. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   8. 
SARAH If you'd rather read something else, mother..... 
RACHEL No, that's fine. 
Rachel is barely listening. She is staring at a black and white photograph in the book. 
We see that the photograph is of a YOUNG MAN in NAZI UNIFORM. It's titled: DIETER VOGEL, "The Surgeon of Birkenau." 
MIRIAM You must be very proud. 
Rachel looks up at her, realizes what Miriam is talking about. RACHEL (A little automatic) ...It's a wonderful achievement. I'm very proud of her. 
MIRIAM And I'm sure you were invaluable in the research. 
SARAH (Keeping it light) Actually, my mother withstood all interrogation. My father was the talker. (Trying a joke) I'm the only journalist in Israel she won't speak to. 
Miriam laughs obligingly but Sarah instantly regrets the remark. 
There is a sudden excited MURMUR from the table. The women look over to where Stephan approaches the table. He is in a motorised WHEELCHAIR. The Mossad Agent attends discreetly in the background. 
Rachel's face hardens. 
RACHEL I thought he couldn't come. 
SARAH (Standing up, surprised) So did I. 
Several of the local POLITICOS have stood up to greet Stephan, who is all smiles and handshakes. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   9. 
STEPHAN (To the politicos) Please, sit, sit. My God, it must be election season. 
There's good-natured laughter from the table. Sarah joins her father, kissing his cheek. 
SARAH You came. 
STEPHAN I came. So you're the famous author I've heard so much about? 
Rachel watches as he takes a place at the table, picks up a copy of the book and examines the cover photograph, holding his glasses a little from his eyes to focus. 
STEPHAN (CONT'D) (Without looking) Rachel. 
RACHEL Stephan. 
STEPHAN (To Sarah) Now you're the expert, maybe you could tell me something. (Pointing to himself) Who's this handsome devil on the cover? 
More polite laughter from the table. 
STEPHAN (CONT'D) It went well? 
SARAH'S HUSBAND She was wonderful. 
STEPHAN That's good. Good, good. That's very good. 
Rachel takes a sip of water and notices Stephen's hands, crumbling some bread - they're SHAKING. 
She looks up at his face, reads the hidden STRAIN there. 
He senses her gaze and meets it, and for a second his smile falters and SOMETHING LIKE PANIC flickers in his eyes. 
44    INT/EXT. STAIRWELL - DAY                                      44 
A brief glimpse of the couple climbing the winding stairs - a view we have seen before. 
45    INT. EAST BERLIN - SAFE HOUSE. DAY                            45 
The place looks like a squat. 
YOUNG Stephan sits playing idly at a battered old upright piano, a cigarette in his mouth. He looks up as David and Rachel walk in and stand framed in the doorway, looking every inch the young married couple. Stephan looks at them for a beat, then starts to play the first few bars of Mendelssohn's wedding march. 
The other two blush furiously, not amused. Rachel takes her case from David. 
RACHEL Where do I sleep? 
STEPHAN You're in my room. 
He waits just long enough to enjoy her reaction. 
STEPHAN (CONT'D) I'm moving in with him. (Beat) You're at the end there. 
She nods and walks off. 
46    INT. KITCHEN - LATER                                          46 Stephan is smoking. David sits at the table. He is using a file to create a notch at the bottom of a thin strip of sprung steel. 
Both men can hear the BATH RUNNING in the bathroom, both very aware of this new female presence in the house they've been sharing together for the last month. 
STEPHAN What do you think of your new wife? 
David frowns at the steel strip, seeming preoccupied. 
DAVID Too young. 
Stephan watches him, amused. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   20. 
STEPHAN Pretty. 
David shrugs. 
STEPHAN (CONT'D) You didn't notice. 
He begins to sort his possessions out. 
STEPHAN (CONT'D) You know what I've noticed? You don't notice women. I've noticed that. How long have I known you? 
DAVID (examining the steel) I don't know. 
STEPHAN Two years. All the places we've been to. You don't look at women. Before I get into that bed, is there anything you have to tell me? 
David sighs, blows on the steel strip and holds it up for Stephan to examine. 
We hear the bathroom door open and there is a quick glimpse of Rachel wrapped in a towel as she slips past the door heading for her room. The two men watch her pass. Stephan turns and catches David's expression. 
STEPHAN Well, well...I think he just noticed. 
CUT TO: 
47    INT. SAFE HOUSE - RACHEL'S ROOM - NIGHT                      47 
Rachel sits on her bed drying her hair. She stops, listening to the indistinct murmur of the men's voices from the room next door. Rachel leans towards the wall, trying to hear more but the voices fall silent. 
48    INT. SAFEHOUSE - MORNING                                     48 
David, holding a kitchen knife, MOVES TO STAB Stephan. 
Stephan uses a krav magah move to disarm him. The knife clatters to the floor as he twists David's arm behind his back. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    21. 
There's an element of showing off and Stephan uses a little more force than is necessary. David winces but doesn't say anything. 
Stephan turns to Rachel who has been watching. 
STEPHAN Yes? 
Rachel nods and they change places. David picks up the knife and repeats the "attack" move on her. She disarms him easily. 
STEPHAN (CONT'D) Now an attack from behind. 
David takes his position, grabbing Rachel from behind, but he's so awkward with her the attack seems a little tentative. 
Stephan talks as Rachel practises breaking free from the hold. 
STEPHAN (CONT'D) Where have you come from? 
RACHEL Argentina. 
STEPHAN Really? Whereabouts? 
RACHEL Cordoba. 
STEPHAN What were you doing there? 
RACHEL My husband is an Industrial Chemist. 
She reaches the chair and climbs onto it. A pause and then, tentatively, she lifts her feet into the stirrups, tugging the gown to cover herself as best she can. 
She tries to steady her breathing, focussing on the ceiling. A bright LIGHT shines down on her. 
We hear footsteps approach. 
Rachel closes her eyes. VOGEL Good morning, Frau Roget. I'm Doctor Bernhardt. 
Rachel opens her eyes. Vogel is sitting on a small stool, taking a speculum from the tray of instruments, his back to us. 
RACHEL Good morning, doctor. 
He turns and smiles at us - and he has a wonderful, warm smile, the air of a gruff but kindly Uncle. 
VOGEL Alright now, just relax. We're going to do a little examination. If you feel at all uncomfortable, you just say. Alright? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   25. 
She manages to nod. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) Alright, this is my hand... and this is the speculum. It's going to feel cold. 
Rachel reacts as Vogel pushes the speculum into place, opens it and begins the examination. She stares up into the light. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) Can I ask how old you are? 
RACHEL Twenty five. 
VOGEL And how long have you and your husband been trying for a baby? RACHEL Nearly two years. 
VOGEL Uhuh. Well, the ovaries look fine. Alright, let's see... your cervix is slightly retroverted. Tilted backwards? 
Rachel raises her hand to her LOCKET NECKLACE and begins to fiddle with it. 
RACHEL Really? The angle from which we next see VOGEL, and the way the image of his face freezes in black and white, tells us clearly that this locket conceals a CAMERA DEVICE. 
VOGEL Mmm. But that generally shouldn't affect fertility. 
RACHEL Oh, good. 
VOGEL You have a slight accent, Frau Roget. Where are you from? 
RACHEL Argentina. We just moved here... A few months ago. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    26. 
VOGEL Whereabouts in Argentina? Buenos Aires? 
He looks up at her and Rachel instinctively moves her hand away from the locket. She finds herself nodding. 
Vogel looks away again. Rachel bites down on a wave of panic. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) Oh, Buenos Aires. Beautiful. I went once, when I was young. We went to the Opera house I remember. What's it called again? 
Rachel stares at the light. Beat. 
RACHEL Teatro Colon. He turns back to her, holding a swab, the warm smile. 
VOGEL That's right. Beautiful. This might sting a little, dear. 
Rachel winces. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) I'm sorry. Now, there's a couple of tests we need to run, make sure there are no problems. Is that alright? 
Rachel nods. He pats her hand. VOGEL (CONT'D) Brave girl. 
57    EXT. CLINIC - DAY                                             57 
Rachel walks out and finds David waiting, smoking. He takes her hand and they walk off without speaking. 
58    EXT. QUIET STREET - DAY                                       58 
The two turn the corner, out of sight of the clinic. David glances at her. She looks pale, shaken. He feels a wave of sudden tenderness for her, opens his mouth to say something then catches himself. 
CLOSE on their hands. After a moment David LETS GO. They walk on. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   27. 
59    INT. BAR - DAY                                               59 
Stephan sits at a table. Rachel and David appear beside him and join him. There is an awkward silence for a moment. Stephan sips his coffee. 
STEPHAN (in German) So. Everything...? 
RACHEL (in German, abruptly) Next appointment is on Wednesday. 
She looks at David but he is staring at the table. Like Stephan he is uncomfortable with the thought of what Rachel has been through. 
She takes his hand. He looks up, surprised, searches her face... But then Rachel lets go and walks off towards the toilets. 
David looks down at the SILVER LOCKET lying in his palm. 
60    EXT. STREET - DAY                                            60 
Stephan walks down the street. A SMARTLY DRESSED MAN walks towards him, absently jingling his CAR KEYS in his hand. 
As he nears Stephan, the man fumbles the keys and they drop. Stephan dips down to pick them up and hands them back to the man with a smile. 
73    INT. LIVING ROOM. BERLIN SAFE HOUSE - EVENING                73 
Rachel runs the hem of a partially-made WHITE GARMENT through a SEWING MACHINE. She finishes and takes it over to where Stephan stands waiting. It's unfinished, but a fairly good approximation of a MEDIC'S WHITE COAT. 
RACHEL Try this on. 
Stephan puts it on. She tugs at the coat, straightens the unfinished collar, runs her hands down the front to smooth it out. 
RACHEL (CONT'D) (re: the coat) How does it feel? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   31. 
STEPHAN (Flirting) Nice. 
Rachel ignores this, begins to pin the cuff of one of the sleeves. 
STEPHAN (CONT'D) Here you are, Mossad agent, all those years of training, the highest levels of marksmanship and krav magah, first big mission...sewing. 
Rachel resists a smile, brandishes the pin. 
RACHEL Black belt in dressmaking. 
He holds up his hands in surrender. STEPHAN I never argue with an armed woman. 
74    INT. KITCHEN. SAFEHOUSE - LATER                              74 
Rachel and Stephan sit as David serves the dinner. Rachel examines her dish. 
RACHEL (Politely) What is it? 
DAVID (Beat) It doesn't have a name. 
Stephan tastes his. 
STEPHAN (Grimacing) Shit. 
David lifts his spoon, blows on it. 
DAVID (Solemn) Now it does. 
They laugh a little, settle into eating. 
David stares at his bowl, deciding whether or not to say something. Finally... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   32. 
DAVID (CONT'D) It's my birthday. 
They look up at him in surprise. 
75    INT. BAR - LATER                                             75 
Tinny music plays. 
The place is almost empty. In the back of the bar the three sit in a corner drinking beer - just young people, laughing, a little drunk. They could be students. 
Rachel is reciting something from memory. 
RACHEL Uh, at ten - study the Mishnah, at fifteen - study the Talmud. By eighteen - stand under the wedding canopy... STEPHAN We're too late for all of those. 
They laugh. 
RACHEL Uh...twenty. In your twenties you are to "pursue your life's goals." 
STEPHAN (Flirtatious) What are you pursuing Rachel? Rachel thinks about it, shrugs. 
RACHEL I don't know. I'm waiting to find out. 
STEPHAN (smiles to himself) Youth... 
RACHEL What about you, grandfather? Have you got a goal? 
STEPHAN (Smiling) Oh yes. We believe in goals in my family. We're very driven men. My father was Director of Collections by the time he was fifty. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   33. 
RACHEL So what's your goal? 
STEPHAN Director of Collections by forty. 
They laugh. 
RACHEL (To David) What about you David. What "life goal" are you pursuing? 
David smiles, stares at his drink. 
DAVID This is it. 
Rachel laughs, looks around at their less than glamorous surroundings. RACHEL This is it? This is all you want? 
David laughs. He would obviously rather change the subject but Rachel is a little drunk, a little curious. 
RACHEL Seriously, what do you want out of life? 
DAVID (Beat, shrugs) I want this. I want to get Vogel. I want him to be put on trial and I want the world to watch so everyone knows what he did. I want them all to know the truth. 
He looks up at their faces, embarrassed at having darkened the atmosphere. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) And yet you say there's no family history of fertility problems? 
RACHEL (Beat) I lost my mother in the war. 
Vogel stares at her. Then, to her dismay, he TAKES HER HAND, and pats it with such a sad, sympathetic look, that she feels her eyes prick with tears. Then he lets go and turns back to the examination. 
76B    EXT. CLINIC - DAY                                            76B 
Rachel comes out to find David waiting for her again. Once more he takes her hand and they walk off. 
76C    EXT. QUIET STREET - DAY                                      76C 
As they turn into the quiet street, David lets go of her hand. Rachel stops. She looks shaken. David watches her. 
DAVID Are you alright? 
She nods. 
Suddenly Rachel takes his hand again. David stares straight ahead but he DOESN'T PULL FREE and they walk on like that. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   37.

Rachel and David walk into the room and find Stephan waiting for them. 
STEPHAN Identity is confirmed. We have a green light. 
Rachel and David stare at him. 
78A    EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY                                    78A 
We are looking at a yellow DEUTSCHE POST van. 
Stephan and David are walking towards it. 
Stephan stops by the van, shielding David as he drops the length of thin steel we saw him working on earlier, from his sleeve - an improvised SLIM JIM. With professional ease he slips the Jim between the window and the weather shield. In seconds he has the door open and the two climb in... 
79     INT. KITCHEN. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT                              79 
Rachel comes out of the bathroom in her nightclothes, with her hair wet around her. She looks into the kitchen. David is sitting smoking. Rachel pauses in the doorway and then walks in. A small two bar electric fire provides the only light in the room. Rachel kneels down in front of it to dry her hair. David looks at her as Rachel spreads her hair around her shoulders. She looks very beautiful. She starts to comb her hair. On impulse, Rachel HOLDS OUT the comb to David. 
David takes it. He starts to comb, pulling it slowly through her hair. Then stops. The atmosphere is suddenly charged. 
DAVID It's a brave thing you're doing. 
RACHEL I'm not brave. I'm terrified. 
DAVID But you're doing it anyway. Because you know how important it is. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    38. 
Another stroke and then he stops again, stares at the comb in his hand. 
DAVID You're very brave. 
RACHEL (Beat) David... 
Rachel turns round and stares at him, overcome with longing. She leans in to KISS HIM. For a moment David hesitates, but then it's as if something inside him closes and he pulls back from Rachel, his face cold. 
Without a word he gets up and walks out. Rachel sits, crushed... 
80    INT. LIVING ROOM. BERLIN SAFE HOUSE - LATER.                  80 Rachel, sits at the piano in her robe, picking out notes. She's been crying. Stephan stands watching her from the doorway, holding a drink - something slightly predatory about him. 
He crosses to her, sits down beside her and starts to match her notes. They work out a nonsense tune between them.

STEPHAN It's whiskey. 
Defiantly Rachel drains the glass, grimaces a little. Stephan watches her. He continues to play, moving the melody up in octaves until his hand is beside hers, then covering hers. Rachel brushes him away. He puts his hand back and starts to caress her wrist. 
STEPHAN (CONT'D) You're so beautiful... 
He begins to kiss her neck. Rachel stares ahead, pretending it isn't happening. Then she gives in, turning to him. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   39.

As they turn into the street, David takes her hand. Both stare fixedly ahead, only too aware of what happened the night before.

Rachel leads them in. Stephan crouches down beside Vogel and takes his pulse. 
STEPHAN We need to take him to the hospital. He and David open up the stretcher and transfer Vogel to it with some efficiency.

The nurse follows, but David stops her. 
DAVID I'm sorry, Madam, but you'll need to meet us at the hospital. 
NURSE But... I want to travel with him. 
DAVID Not possible I'm afraid. New regulations.

As Stephan and David carry the stretcher down the stairs, Rachel takes the nurse's hand to detain her. 
RACHEL Don't worry, he's in good hands now. He's going to be fine. 
NURSE Thank you...thank you. 
RACHEL You should get your things, go to the hospital to meet him. 
The Nurse nods tearfully, starts to back towards her office, watching as they disappear.

David closes the rear door of the van and the two jump in and drive off as Rachel comes out of the building. 
She begins to walk briskly away. Behind her, the real ambulance is pulling up at the clinic. She doesn't turn back. 
102    EXT. COURTYARD/STREET NEAR CLINIC - LATE AFTERNOON           102 
The DEUTSCHE POST VAN that David and Stephan stole earlier pulls out into the street. Behind it we catch a glimpse of the now abandoned ambulance. David quickly closes the gate and climbs in.

The winter evening is gathering outside. David and Rachel are in the back of the van. David has taken off the white coat. David checks his watch. 
STEPHAN (Tense) I know, I know. 
He accelerates. 
Rachel grabs hold of the back of the seat to avoid falling. She looks down at the stretcher - Vogel lies unconscious. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   45.

As it passes them, the train screens Stephan and David from the platform. The two men rise and swiftly begin to cut the remaining section of fence. 
As the train comes to a halt the last carriages stop directly opposite them, empty and dark. They're almost there.

RACHEL Well, maybe I'll see you there? I finish in half an hour. Why don't you go and get me a drink ready?

He starts to move towards the gate... 
Suddenly the VAN HORN BLARES, shattering the silence of the car park.

Vogel, hands still tied has wormed his way over the seats and is pressing frantically on the HORN. He claws at the tape over his mouth, manages to pull it free. Stephan leaps into the van and is upon him in seconds. Vogel manages to give a HOARSE YELL, then Stephan uses a krav magah move to silence him.

He heads for the van at a crouching run.

Rachel indicates the vans closest to them. 
RACHEL I think it came from over here? 
WORKER No, it was one of those... 
He steps past her, peering at the shadowy vans ahead. Rachel stares at him wondering if she can take him down silently. 
BORDER GUARD (O.S.) Stay where you are! 
She turns to see two BORDER GUARDS approaching the side gate of the car park. 
She watches in dismay as the van heads for the exit. 
Suddenly it brakes... 
IN THE VAN 
Stephan throws the gear into reverse.. 
ON RACHEL 
and the van begins to reverse with a scream of tyres towards Rachel. 
The Guards at the side-gate open fire on the van hurtling towards them, bullets pocking the rear doors. 
The side door is flung open and Rachel dives in, just as Stephan roars forward again.

On the road ahead a Border Guard Jeep appears, driving directly towards them. 
Stephan has no choice - he floors it. 
At the last second the jeep tries to pull right but the van catches its rear side and barrels straight through, the jeep spinning off and smashing into the wall.

STEPHAN Is he dead? (Beat) Is he dead? 
RACHEL Who? 
STEPHAN The Guard! The one who saw your face! Is he dead? RACHEL No. 
Stephen's grim silence says everything. He glances back at the unconscious Vogel lying between the other two. 
STEPHAN How did he come round? How the fuck did he come round? You gave him the full injection? 
Rachel hesitates. 
STEPHAN Did you give him the...

131    INT. SAFE HOUSE. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                            131 
Rachel sits on the floor looking towards the living room, staring at something. 
RACHEL'S P.O.V 
...three POTS have been placed under drips from the ceiling inside the room. We hear the three distinct notes of the water drops. 
Rachel stares dully at the water dripping, feeling exhausted and numb. A key scrapes and Rachel turns to the door as Stephan and David walk in, hair soaked from the rain. 
RACHEL (Standing up) What did he say? 
Stephan stalks past, ignoring her. 
RACHEL You made contact? 
David nods. David looks after Stephan who's walked on into the living room in grim silence. 
He smiles, stares at her, moves a little closer but Rachel has already side-stepped him and walked away.

An exhausted David, finishing his shift, walks out of the living room as Stephan walks out of his bedroom to take his place. Rachel walks out of the bathroom and into her bedroom, for a moment the three criss-crossing each other's paths. Rachel's bedroom door closes. Both men avoid looking at each other as they pass it.

Before they can get there Vogel pisses himself, the urine puddling on the floor at their feet.

Vogel leans against the wall, staring blankly at the window, sunk into a profound depression. He looks filthy, jaw dark with beard growth. 
Rachel watches him from the doorway.

Rachel is washing Vogel's face with a towel. He pays no attention, continuing to stare out of the window. 
Rachel picks up a bowl of shaving cream, strips the tape off VOGEL's mouth, and begins to brush the cream over his face. She produces a RAZOR and carefully begins to shave his cheeks. 
She stops suddenly, a TEAR is running down Vogel's cheek, cutting a line through the soap. He turns his eyes to her. 
VOGEL Why don't you just kill me now? 
Rachel pauses for a moment. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) How can you keep me waiting to die like this! 
Rachel keeps on shaving. 
VOGEL I know what you want. You want to hand me over to the others, let there be some fucking sham of a trial. Then, when they kill me, you can tell yourself that there was no blood on your hands. 
Rachel switches to the other cheek. Vogel's getting more animated, tears in his eyes, a kind of bizarre indignation... 
VOGEL (CONT'D) But that isn't true. There will be blood on your hands. (MORE) FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    61. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) You will be my murderer! You fucking hypocrite. You fucking... 
Rachel tilts his chin up a little and puts the razor to his throat. He falls silent, tenses, waiting. Then... 
VOGEL (CONT'D) (Softly) Yes. Do it. You want to do it... 
Rachel finishes with a trembling hand. 
Vogel slumps back against the wall, the tension in his body easing away. He gives her a long, calculating look. 
And as we watch some CHANGE seems to come over him, some new fire beginning to kindle in him - a sense of cold contempt for Rachel and with it, perhaps, a fresh determination to survive this. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) That's right. I'd forgotten. You Jews never knew how to kill. Only how to die. 
Rachel wipes the razor clean on the towel, SLAPS fresh tape onto Vogel's mouth and gets up.

She opens the door and steps out...

RACHEL Oh God... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   65.

DAVID What does that mean? What's the plan now? 
RACHEL (rising panic) We just need to get him to the airfield, there must be some other way, some... 
Stephan starts down the hallway towards her, angry. 
STEPHAN I said has he...? 
David instinctively steps in front of Rachel, raises a hand. DAVID (overlapping) I'm asking you... 
STEPHAN (overlapping) I'm talking to her! Supposedly it's her shift now, but instead of doing what she's supposed to be doing she's out here with you! (To Rachel) Now answer the fucking question: Did you feed him? 
RACHEL YES! I fed him! 
Stephan stands glaring at her, then turns abruptly away. 
STEPHAN (Beat) There's no plan. There's no fucking plan. They said the operation is being "re- evaluated." 
He turns to David. 
STEPHAN You know what that means? They're going to cut us loose. 
They stare at him shocked. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   66.

STEPHAN It's happening. I can feel it. 
RACHEL They can't just leave us!

Stephan stares at the door, thrown. 
DAVID (CONT'D) Could you have been...? 
There is another KNOCK at the door. Stephan turns to the chest of drawers and takes out the GUN. 
RACHEL Stephan? Stephan is hurriedly screwing the SILENCER onto the GUN. There's another KNOCK at the door. 
RACHEL (CONT'D) Stephan! 
Stephan walks into the living room and aims the gun at Vogel. Vogel instinctively squirms away, falling to one side, wriggling back as far as he can. 
RACHEL (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
STEPHAN If it's them, he dies. 
Vogel lies, breathing hard through his nose, eyes on the gun aimed at him. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    67. 
David suddenly steps in between the two, the gun now pointing at his chest.

STEPHAN He's not getting away from me. 
DAVID This isn't the mission. 
STEPHAN I decide what the mission is! If I say he dies, he dies. 
DAVID We're finishing this mission. We're taking him back. 
STEPHAN Get out of the way! 
There is another KNOCK at the door. David and Stephan stare at each other, the tension building. Abruptly Rachel turns and walks down the hallway towards the door. Stephan calls after her. 
STEPHAN Rachel. Rachel! 
From the hallway we hear the sound of the door being opened - the murmur of conversation. The two men stand frozen, listening. Vogel lies, breathing hard through his nose. 
We hear the door close. The three listen as footsteps approach down the hall... 
Rachel walks back in. A long beat. 
RACHEL (Dully) It was the lady from the bottom apartment. She invited us to her New Year's Eve party. 
She turns and walks back out. The others stay where they are, frozen.

160    INT. SAFEHOUSE - LIVING ROOM. EVENING.                        160 
It's raining heavily outside and water is dripping through the cracks in the ceiling. 
David kneels next to VOGEL with a bowl of oatmeal and strips the tape from his mouth. 
VOGEL Thank you. David. 
David doesn't react. Vogel hums a tune to himself in between spoonfuls, watching David, his mood strange. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) David and Stephan and Rachel... 
He gives a soft laugh, finding something amusing in the sound of the names. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) If I had a choice I'd prefer Rachel to feed me. So gentle...in another life, the makings of a Nurse, I think...in another life... 
David continues to feed, careful to appear immune to Vogel. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) How is she today? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   72. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) You should let her get more rest. It's a dangerous time, the first month or two of the pregnancy. 
David stares at him, unable to hide his shock. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) (Beat) You didn't know? 
Vogel absorbs this thoughtfully. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) You're not the father then? (Beat)I thought it would be you. I thought...I don't know. The way you look at her. The way she looks at you... 
David stirs the oatmeal, trying to think about what he's just discovered. Vogel doesn't take his eyes off him... 
VOGEL (CONT'D) Women can be like that, they like to make you dance first, I remember. (As though to himself) So, she chose the other one...? 
He shakes his head, shrugs. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) That must be hard, watching them together, right in front of you. And you not saying a word. Like the Poet says - "Great souls suffer in silence." I wouldn't have taken Stephan as a family man. Too ambitious, too...? Whereas you? David, I see you with children... 
DAVID (Quietly) Shut up. 
Vogel stares at him. This is the first time someone has spoken to him in weeks. He's quick to hide his sense of triumph. 
VOGEL I am expressing my sympathy. For your suffering. 
DAVID What does a monster like you know about suffering? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   73. 
VOGEL I'm a doctor, David. 
David stares at him. 
DAVID A doctor. (beat)You blind children trying to change the colour of their eyes. You inject people with petrol. You...you replace people's hands and legs and you watch as they... 
He stops himself. 
DAVID (CONT'D) This isn't medicine. This is disease. This is sickness. 
Vogel seems to consider this. VOGEL So we were all insane? Is that the answer? 
DAVID (Beat) There's no answer. I'm not looking for an answer. I'm not looking for... 
He forces himself to be silent, tries to regain control of himself. He offers Vogel another spoonful, but his hand trembles a little with the violence of his emotions. 
VOGEL You're trembling. 
David pushes the spoon into Vogel's mouth, starts to load another spoonful. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) It's strange. Here I am - the victim, kidnapped, bound, soon to be murdered, but I think you are the one that is afraid, David. (Beat) Afraid of the monster. 
He leans closer to David. 
Rachel is packing, folding clothes neatly, precisely, silently - but all the time there's a terrible tension about her movements. 
She tries to close a drawer but it sticks, She keeps trying, then in a sudden rush of fury yanks the drawer free and hurls it across the room. 
She stands breathing hard. 
Then something we didn't see - her gaze settles on a photograph beside her table - SARAH holding her son, smiling at us. 
Rachel stares at the photograph, her breathing slowing. 
174    EXT. PATIO TERRACE. HOTEL NEAR TEL AVIV - DAY                174 
Stephan sits amongst the remains of a meal. Sarah and her husband are on the beach below, playing with their son. 
Stephan watches them. He senses a presence and turns to find Rachel behind him. She sits down, stares down at the beach through her dark glasses. 
Stephan watches, almost holding his breath, working through lightning calculations of how to handle her. But Rachel is the first to speak. 
RACHEL (Beat) I always knew this would happen. I knew we'd be punished. I knew we'd have to pay. 
STEPHAN (Quietly) I thought I'd already been punished. 
RACHEL God doesn't plant car bombs. 
STEPHAN I wasn't referring to the wheelchair. 
They look at each other. 
STEPHAN (CONT'D) If I could go back, Rachel, I'd change it all. If I could give you back a chance to be happy, to be... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   85. 
He stops. She is staring back at him coldly, unmoved. He shrugs, letting that go. 
STEPHAN (CONT'D) But there's one thing I would never change. 
She looks over to where Sarah is playing with her son, laughing. 
RACHEL (Instantly) She isn't going to find out. 
She shakes her head, as if the idea itself were impossible. 
RACHEL (CONT'D) She can never find out. 
Stephan stares at her, KNOWING THAT HE HAS HER, that it's already decided. He takes out the envelope and slides it across the table towards her. She examines the ticket and passports inside. Then he slides her the BLACK CASE. We've seen this part of the scene before. 
She stares at it with disgust, knowing what it is. Then she takes it and puts it in her handbag. 
STEPHAN My car's waiting outside. It can take you to the airport. 
She stands up, an elegant woman at lunch, her dark glasses, her suit... She looks down to Sarah, raises a hand in farewell. 
Sarah, not understanding, waves a hand in response, calls something which is lost under the sound of the sea. 
STEPHAN (CONT'D) Go down to her. Say goodbye to her. 
Rachel stands stock still, staring down at her daughter. 
RACHEL How can I? (Beat.) How can I? 
She turns and walks away. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   86.

A tram wipes through the frame to reveal Rachel walking across a busy street towards the stark facade of an imposing 1960's building. A TITLE reads:   Kiev, Ukraine 
180     INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY                                   180 
The public area of the building - a main reception desk, a little cafe, a sweeping staircase leading up to the floor above... 
Rachel is at the reception desk... 
180A    NEWSPAPER BUILDING - MEZZANINE LEVEL - CONTINUOUS         180A 
Rachel crosses to a TABAC KIOSK, glancing back to some glass doors behind her. 
A sign indicates the offices of the UKRAINIAN EVENING NEWS. 
We can see a RECEPTIONIST at her desk. A young man walks through the entrance, and she throws a knowing glance up at him as he passes. 
Rachel takes in the ALARM PAD beside the receptionist.

184    INT. NEWSPAPER BUILDING - GROUND FL. CAFE - EARLY EVENING 184 Rachel sits, still smoking, though it's dark outside now. There is a sound of chatter from above her and she looks up to see JOURNALISTS spilling out from the offices above, coming down the stairs towards her. 
Rachel eases a PHOTOCOPIED SHEET from her bag and examines it... 
INSERT SHEET 
A photocopy of a JOURNALIST'S BY-LINE - a long, rather mournful face, the name YURI TITOV. 
She checks the face, slips the sheet back in the bag, looks up, studying the men descending towards her. Moments later she has found him - chatting to a colleague. 
He reaches the ground floor and walking past her, goes to the bar for a coffee. 
Rachel finds herself staring at him -   the man WHO COULD DESTROY HER LIFE. 
Yuri seems to sense someone watching him and looks to where Rachel was sitting. 
But there's no-one there.

She starts to put it on and the Boyfriend gives a brief bark and play-bites at her neck. She laughs, pushing him away. Rachel hurries in. 
RACHEL (Russian) Am I late? I'm sorry.... Can I place an advertisement? 
RECEPTIONIST (gathering her things) 100 grivna for twenty words. 5 grivna a word after that. 
Rachel proffers an envelope. 
RACHEL (CONT'D) Here... 
The girl takes it. RECEPTIONIST Thanks. 
Rachel fishes in her bag and hands over a 100 GRIVNA NOTE. 
RACHEL This should cover it. 
The girl drops the envelope onto her desk, and slips the money into a small DESKTOP DRAWER UNIT, as Rachel leaves.

BOYFRIEND You're worth it. 
RECEPTIONIST You're going to get me fired! 
BOYFRIEND (Kissing her) I'm worth it. 
They kiss again, slowly backing up against the desk Rachel was searching. The two struggle with their clothes. 
195    BEHIND THE COLUMN                                            195 
Rachel has no way of reaching the door. 
She closes her eyes as the young couple begin to have sex on the desk. 
Then she opens her eyes and notices something... 
RACHEL'S P.O.V - CLOSE on her TORCH which is still on the desk. 
The Boyfriend seems to be staring RIGHT AT IT. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   96. 
Rachel watches, holding her breath. 
ON BOYFRIEND 
...as we realise he is staring STRAIGHT THROUGH the torch, lost in the moment. 
Next moment the couple change positions and some books and the torch are swept from the desk and clatter to the floor. The TORCH ROLLS across the carpet to the shadowy entrance of the cubicle. 
BEHIND THE COLUMN 
Rachel stares at the torch, wondering if she can reach it before they can see her. But at the moment the desktop tryst reaches its noisy conclusion. 
AT THE DESK 
The Boyfriend does up his trousers and pulls on his coat. 
The Receptionist adjusts her dress. She notices the fallen items and begins to pick them up, following the trail to the torch. 
BEHIND THE COLUMN 
Rachel stands frozen as the Receptionist stoops down directly IN FRONT OF HER and picks up the torch. 
The Boyfriend notices. BOYFRIEND What are you doing? 
RECEPTIONIST I'm tidying up. 
BOYFRIEND Are you working? Are you at work now? 
RECEPTIONIST (Laughing) No, I'm not working. 
BOYFRIEND So leave them. 
She drops the objects and follows her Boyfriend out. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   97. 
Shaking, Rachel picks up her torch and replaces the items she is still holding from Yuri's file into the filing cabinet. 
From OS, we hear the BEEP BEEP BEEP of the alarm being reset. 
Rachel's heart sinks. 
OS, we hear office doors close, and the KEY TURNING in the lock. 
Rachel's eyes alight on A MOTION SENSOR, blinking in the corner of the room. 
She waits. And eventually - no choice - she runs for the door. 
The motion sensor lights up and the alarm strikes up loudly with a warning BEEP-BEEP-BEEP.

Moments later, the alarm CLANGS into action.

Rachel reaches a MAP on the wall and scans it, frantically trying to locate the room she needs. 
She hurries on to an ancient looking ELEVATOR and gets in, jabs at the fourth floor button. 
With a groan of its motor the elevator begins to rise.

Rachel sits in a CUBICLE. She takes the BLACK CASE from her handbag and opens it. Inside is a pen. She lifts this and the false bottom of the case away to reveal a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE and an AMPULE of a clear liquid. With trembling hands she begins to prepare the injection. 
She can't quite believe what she is about to do. 
220     INT. ROOM 414 - CONTINUOUS                                   220 
Rachel enters the room. The curtains are drawn and Rachel hesitates for a moment, her eyes adjusting to the gloom. A MAN sits in a chair, angled towards the window, his back to us. An IV drip hangs on a stand, its tube running into a cannula on the back of a withered hand which hangs from the chair. 
The only sound is the faint, rasping breath of the man. 
Rachel moves a little closer. On the bottom of the bed hangs a medical chart. The name reads Ivan Schevchuk. 
Rachel moves closer, carefully taking the HYPODERMIC NEEDLE from her pocket. 
221     INT. BABENKO HOSPITAL - RECEPTION. DAY.                      221 A NURSE is unlocking the gate at the waiting area for Yuri. He walks through them and over to the ELEVATOR.

Rachel stands by the IV drip and tube. She can inject directly into the tube - and it will be over. She holds the tube, rests the tip of the needle against it. She struggles with herself. Just one tiny push... 
She can't do it. 
She stands frozen for a moment then slowly lowers the needle. 
Beside her, the steady breathing alters. The Man stirs and a cadaverous face half turns towards us. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   107. 
Rachel and Schevchuk stare at each other. The face is ancient, lined...but IT ISN'T THE FACE OF VOGEL. 
IVAN SCHEVCHUK (Weakly) Are you the journalist? (Beat) Do you know who I am? 
RACHEL (Beat, meaning it) No. No, I don't. 
IVAN SCHEVCHUK My name is Dieter Vogel. I am the Surgeon of Birkenau. (Beat) Have you heard of me? 
RACHEL Yes. I've heard of you. 
Schevchuk looks at his withered hands. IVAN SCHEVCHUK (Simply) I have killed thousands. You can take my photograph. The last photograph of the Surgeon of Birkenau? 
He struggles to raise his arm in the Nazi salute, a pathetic sick man. 
Rachel sits down at Schevchuk's desk, feeling suddenly exhausted.

NURSE Hold the doors please. 
Yuri holds the doors, as the Nurse approaches, escorting an ELDERLY WOMAN with a walker - the two moving at a snails pace. 
Yuri watches, amused.

PULLING RACHEL As she moves down another corridor. 
She reaches an opening on her left, which reveals a STAIRCASE winding around a central lift shaft, caged in frosted glass panels. 
She glances through it as she passes. 
And just for a second we see an ELDERLY MAN walking down the stairs. 
Rachel has walked on a few steps before it registers, and she stops - 
VOGEL. 
She walks back to the opening. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   112. 
The figure seems to have retraced their steps, because they are now walking FURTHER UP the staircase, on the other side of the lift shaft - a shadowy figure through the frosted glass which quickly disappears from sight. 
Rachel stares after him, frozen. What did she just see?

240     INT. REC ROOM - DAY                                          240 
Rachel comes through double doors and finds herself in a long REC ROOM - PATIENTS and some STAFF grouped around the room. 
Rachel begins to walk through the room - elderly men all around her, playing cards, reading, some sitting staring vacantly. 
She walks through them, staring at faces. Is he here? Is he amongst this ordinary world? 
She feels her pace quicken as she's drawn on through the room. It's as if she's back at that terrible night. Vogel's ahead of her somewhere, escaping all over again. 
She FLASHES through DOUBLE DOORS into a junction area - a long, empty corridor leading away from her on the right, ahead another set of double doors... 
She bursts through these doors and finds herself in... 
241     INT. LOCKER ROOM/BATHROOM - DAY                              241 
A long, white tiled corridor of a room. A row of windows down the right, under which sit WASHBASINS. There's a row of LOCKERS and DOORS along the left. 
Rachel walks on, feeling increasingly as if she's in a dream. 
She's deep into the room before she realises it's a dead- end - there's no exit ahead of her. 
VOGEL (a dull rasp) Why did you come...? 
She turns and freezes. 
Vogel has emerged from one of the doorways on the left. Now he's between her and the doors on the far side of the room. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   113. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) Why did you have to come? You didn't have to follow me. 
He begins to advance slowly towards her. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) Was it Schevchuk? Did he talk? 
Rachel stands frozen as he creeps closer. He reaches out a hand as if to reassure her, a ghastly attempt at reasonableness. 
VOGEL I can stop him. I won't tell him anymore. (Almost pleading) Nobody needs to know. 
As if the spell has broken Rachel makes a sudden dart for the doors. But before she can pass him, Vogel has moved with surprising speed and, almost before Rachel has seen the SCISSORS in his other hand, he has stabbed them into her shoulder. 
She reels over against the opposite wall, dislodging a GLASS SHELF which shatters into a WASHBASIN behind her. 
Vogel goes after her, pinning her against the basin, one hand on her throat, the other hand trying to stab her again. Rachel manages to grab the scissor hand and the two struggle frantically. 
The scissors inch closer to her FACE, to her EYE. 
Her other hand emerges from the basin behind her holding a piece of the broken glass shelf, which she whips across Vogel's face. 
He gives a horrible shriek and lets her go, clutching at his cheek. 
Rachel collapses gasping to the floor. 
Moaning, Vogel stumbles to a basin, blood dripping down onto the white porcelain from his slashed face. 
He suddenly notices Rachel has made it to her knees and is trying to crawl towards the door, 
He walks after her, pulls back her head, gets ready to stab the scissors into her throat. 
VOGEL You Jews never knew how to kill. Only how to die. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   114. 
Then he gives a gasp of pain, eyes closed, his whole body doubling with the pain, hands weakly scrabbling at the PIECE OF GLASS Rachel has stabbed into his thigh. 
He falls, almost on top of Rachel, and she finds herself pressed against his contorted face as he hisses and spits in agony.

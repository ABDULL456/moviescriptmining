SCENE ONE 
A booth at a Chinese restaurant, Williamson and Levene are seated at the booth. 
LEVENE John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look: (pause) The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the... 
WILLIAMSON Shelly, you blew the last... 
LEVENE No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed... 
WILLIAMSON ...you didn't close... 
LEVENE ...I, if you'd listen to me. Please.  I closed the cocksucker. His ex, John, his ex, I didn't know he was married...he, the judge invalidated the... 
WILLIAMSON Shelly... 
LEVENE ...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say. 
WILLIAMSON (pause) What about the other two? 
LEVENE What two? 
WILLIAMSON Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say... 
LEVENE ...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down... 
WILLIAMSON ...no... 
LEVENE ...do you want to go downtown...? 
WILLIAMSON ...no... 
LEVENE ...then... 
WILLIAMSON ...I only... 
LEVENE ...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that? (pause) What is that...? 
WILLIAMSON All that I'm saying... 
LEVENE What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there? 
WILLIAMSON Roma. 
LEVENE Under him? 
LEVENE ...ah, fuck this... 
WILLIAMSON The...Shelly? (pause) The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per... 
LEVENE That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross. 
WILLIAMSON Either way.  You're out. 
LEVENE I'm out. 
WILLIAMSON Yes. 
LEVENE I'll tell you why I'm out.  I'm out, you're giving me toilet paper. John. (MORE) 
LEVENE (CONT'D) I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke, John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks, John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per... 
WILLIAMSON ...they kicked out. 
LEVENE They all kick out.  You run in streaks, pal.  Streaks.  I'm... I'm...don't look at the board, look at me.  Shelly Levene.  Anyone. Ask them on Western.  Ask Getz at Homestead.  Go ask Jerry Graff. You know who I am...I NEED A SHOT. I got to get on the fucking board. Ask them.  Ask them.  Ask them who ever picked up a check I was flush. Moss, Jerry Graff, Mitch himself...Those guys lived on the business I brought in.  They lived on it...and so did Murray, John. You were here you'd of benefited from it too.  And now I'm saying this.  Do I want charity?  Do I want pity?  I want sits.  I want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.  Give me a lead hotter than that, I'll go in and close it.  Give me a chance. That's all I want.  I'm going to get up on that fucking board and all I want is a chance.  It's a streak and I'm going to turn it around. (pause) I need your help. 
Pause. 
WILLIAMSON I can't do it, Shelly. 
Pause. 
LEVENE Why? 
WILLIAMSON The leads are assigned randomly... 
LEVENE Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me? 
WILLIAMSON ...apart from the top men on the contest board. 
LEVENE Then put me on the board. 
WILLIAMSON You start closing again, you'll be on the board. 
LEVENE I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you... 
WILLIAMSON I can't do it, Shel. 
Pause. 
LEVENE I'll give you ten percent. 
Pause. 
WILLIAMSON Of what? 
LEVENE And what if you don't close. 
LEVENE I will close. 
MOSS We're stuck with this fucking shit... 
AARONOW ...this shit... 
MOSS It's too... 
AARONOW It is. 
MOSS Eh? 
AARONOW It's too... 
MOSS You get a bad month, all of a... 
AARONOW You're on this... 
MOSS All of, they got you on this "board..." 
AARONOW I, I...I... 
MOSS Some contest board... 
AARONOW I... 
MOSS It's not right. 
AARONOW It's not. 
MOSS No. 
Pause. 
AARONOW And it's not right to the customers. 
MOSS I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years. 
AARONOW That's right? 
MOSS Eh...? 
AARONOW That's right? 
MOSS Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before." 
AARONOW ...that's right... 
MOSS Eh? 
AARONOW No.  That's absolutely right. 
MOSS And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to... 
AARONOW ...that's right... 
MOSS Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is? 
AARONOW What? 
MOSS Starting up. 
AARONOW What hard part? 
MOSS Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is? 
AARONOW What? 
MOSS Just the act. 
AARONOW What act? 
MOSS To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those... 
AARONOW That's right... 
MOSS He made up those rules, and we're working for him. 
AARONOW That's the truth... 
MOSS That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked." 
AARONOW Huh. 
MOSS You don't ax your sales force. 
AARONOW No. 
MOSS You... 
AARONOW You... 
MOSS You build it! 
AARONOW That's what I... 
MOSS You fucking build it!  Men come... 
AARONOW Men come work for you... 
MOSS ...you're absolutely right. 
AARONOW They... 
MOSS They have... 
AARONOW When they... 
MOSS Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no. (pause) No. (pause) You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something. 
MOSS No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this? 
Pause. 
AARONOW Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just... 
MOSS No, we're just... 
AARONOW We're just "talking" about it. 
MOSS We're just speaking about it. (pause) As an idea. 
AARONOW As an idea. 
MOSS Yes. 
AARONOW We're not actually talking about it. 
MOSS No. 
AARONOW Talking about it as a... 
MOSS No. 
AARONOW As a robbery. 
MOSS As a "robbery"?!  No. 
AARONOW Well.  Well... 
MOSS Hey. 
Pause. 
AARONOW So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff. 
MOSS Not actually, no. 
Pause. 
AARONOW You didn't? 
MOSS No.  Not actually. 
AARONOW Did you? 
MOSS What did you say? 
MOSS Yes. (pause) I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking... 
AARONOW We are? 
MOSS Yes. 
MOSS Is that what I said? 
AARONOW He'd give me a job. 
MOSS He would take you on.  Yes. 
Pause. 
AARONOW Is that the truth? 
MOSS Yes.  It is, George. (pause) Yes.  It's a big decision. (pause) And it's a big reward. (pause) It's a big reward.  For one night's work. (pause) But it's got to be tonight. 
AARONOW What? 
MOSS What?  What?  The leads. 
AARONOW You have to steal the leads tonight? 
MOSS That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest. 
AARONOW You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and... 
MOSS You... 
AARONOW I'm sorry? 
MOSS You. 
Pause. 
AARONOW Me? 
MOSS You have to go in. (pause) You have to get the leads. 
Pause. 
AARONOW I do? 
MOSS Yes. 
AARONOW I... 
MOSS It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth. (pause) "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..." 
AARONOW They'll know when you go over to Graff... 
MOSS What will they know?  That I stole the leads?  I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn.  Why did I go to Graff?  I got a better deal. Period.  Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case. 
Pause. 
AARONOW Dave. 
MOSS Yes. 
MOSS That's right. 
AARONOW Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...? 
MOSS That's none of your fucking business... 
AARONOW Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal... 
MOSS You went for it. 
AARONOW In the abstract... 
MOSS So I'm making it concrete. 
AARONOW Why? 
MOSS Why?  Why you going to give me five grand? 
AARONOW Do you need five grand? 
MOSS Is that what I just said? 
AARONOW You need money?  Is that the... 
MOSS Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...? 
AARONOW What is the five grand? (pause) What is the, you said that we were going to split five... 
MOSS I lied. (pause) Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences. 
AARONOW I do? 
MOSS Yes. 
Pause. 
AARONOW And why is that? 
MOSS Because you listened. 
SCENE THREE 
The restaurant.  Roma is seated alone at the booth.  Lingk is at the booth next to him.  Roma is talking to him. 
ROMA ...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it. (pause) You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...? 
LINGK Did I...? 
ROMA Yes. 
LINGK I don't know. 
ROMA Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them? 
WILLIAMSON They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left. 
ROMA They didn't get my contracts. 
WILLIAMSON They--excuse me... 
He goes back into inner room with the Detective. 
ROMA Oh, fuck.  Fuck. (he starts kicking the desk) FUCK FUCK FUCK!  WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!! (goes to the door Williamson went into, tries the door; it's locked) OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON...

Williamson comes out. 
WILLIAMSON They didn't get the contracts. 
ROMA Did they... 
WILLIAMSON They got, listen to me... 
ROMA The... 
WILLIAMSON Listen to me: They got some of them. 
ROMA Some of them... 
BAYLEN Who told you...? 
ROMA Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me. 
BAYLEN (looking back toward the inner office) Moss...Who told him? 
ROMA How the fuck do I know? (to Williamson) What...talk to me. 
WILLIAMSON They took some of the con... 
ROMA ...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed... 
WILLIAMSON You closed him yesterday. 
ROMA Yes. 
WILLIAMSON It went down.  I filed it. 
ROMA You did? 
WILLIAMSON Yes. 
ROMA Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac. 
WILLIAMSON I... 
ROMA And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car. 
Pause. 
AARONOW It is dead. 
ROMA It's a waste of time. 
AARONOW Yes. (long pause) I'm no fucking good. 
ROMA That's... 
AARONOW Everything I...you know... 
ROMA That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George. 
AARONOW I am? 
ROMA You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole. 
AARONOW He said he filed... 
ROMA He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the... (pause) I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones? 
AARONOW They stole... 
ROMA They stole the... 
AARONOW What.  What kind of outfit are we running where...where anyone... 
ROMA (to himself) They stole the phones. 
AARONOW Where criminals can come in here... they take the... 
ROMA They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ. (pause) What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... (starts for the door) 
AARONOW You think they're going to catch... where are you going? 
ROMA Down the street. 
WILLIAMSON (sticking his head out of the door) Where are you going? 
ROMA To the restaura...what do you fucking...? 
WILLIAMSON Aren't you going out today? 
ROMA With what? (pause) With what, John, they took the leads... 
WILLIAMSON I have the stuff from last year's... 
ROMA Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to... 
WILLIAMSON ...you want to go out today...? 
ROMA 'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me... (to himself) Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all... 
ROMA I was at home, where were you? 
AARONOW At home. 
ROMA See...?  Were you the guy who broke in? 
AARONOW Was I? 
ROMA Yes. 
AARONOW No. 
ROMA Then don't sweat it, George, you know why? 
AARONOW No. 
ROMA You have nothing to hide. 
AARONOW (pause) When I talk to the police, I get nervous. 
ROMA Yeah.  You know who doesn't? 
AARONOW No, who? 
ROMA Thieves. 
AARONOW Why? 
ROMA They're inured to it. 
AARONOW You think so? 
ROMA Yes. 
Pause. 
AARONOW But what should I tell them? 
ROMA The truth, George.  Always tell the truth.  It's the easiest thing to remember. 
Williamson comes out of the office with leads.  Roma takes one, reads it. 
ROMA Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue? 
WILLIAMSON If you don't want it, give it back. 
ROMA I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift. 
WILLIAMSON I'm giving you three leads.  You... 
ROMA What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's... 
WILLIAMSON The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town... 
ROMA They took the typewriters, they took the leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts... 
LEVENE Wh...wh...Wha...? 
AARONOW We had a robbery. (goes into the inner room) 
LEVENE (pause) When? 
ROMA Last night, this morning. 
Pause. 
LEVENE They took the leads? 
ROMA Mmm. 
Moss comes out of the interrogation. 
MOSS Fuckin' asshole. 
ROMA What, they beat you with a rubber bat? 
MOSS Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole... 
ROMA You going to turn State's? 
MOSS Fuck you, Ricky.  I ain't going out today.  I'm going home.  I'm going home because nothing's accomplished here...Anyone talks to this guy is... 
ROMA Guess what the Machine did? 
MOSS Fuck the Machine. 
ROMA Mountain View.  Eight units. 
MOSS Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place... 
ROMA You hear what I said? 
MOSS Yeah.  He closed a deal. 
ROMA Eight units.  Mountain View. 
MOSS (to Levene) You did that? 
LEVENE Yeah. 
Pause. 
MOSS Fuck you. 
ROMA Guess who? 
MOSS When... 
Aaronow sticks his head out. 
AARONOW Can we get some coffee...? 
MOSS How ya doing? 
Pause. 
AARONOW Fine. 
MOSS Uh-huh. 
AARONOW If anyone's going, I could use some coffee. 
LEVENE "You do get the..." (to Roma) Huh?  Huh? 
MOSS Fuck is that supposed to mean? 
LEVENE "You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..." 
MOSS Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts? 
Pause. 
LEVENE I got 'em in the kitchen.  I'm eating her crumb cake. 
MOSS What does that mean? 
ROMA It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you. (pause) And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth. 
MOSS You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...? 
LEVENE Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the... 
MOSS Shut the fuck up. (pause) Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you... (to Levene) And what the fuck are you babbling about...? (MORE) 
MOSS (CONT'D) (to Roma) Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it. (pause) You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right. 
ROMA Who said "Fuck the Machine"? 
MOSS "Fuck the Machine"? "Fuck the Machine"?  What is this.  Courtesy class...?  You're fucked, Rick--are you fucking nuts?  You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  You want to... 
LEVENE Dave... 
MOSS ...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board... 
ROMA Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry... 
MOSS Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz... 
ROMA Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "How much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum. (MORE) 
ROMA (CONT'D) I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are... 
LEVENE Get 'em to me! 
WILLIAMSON I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's... 
LEVENE Did you tell 'em my sale? 
WILLIAMSON How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine. 
LEVENE It's better than a good sale.  It's a... 
WILLIAMSON Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense... 
LEVENE All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale. 
WILLIAMSON The only thing remarkable is who you made it to. 
LEVENE What does that fucking mean? 
WILLIAMSON That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle. 
LEVENE Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust... 
WILLIAMSON I were you, I'd calm down, Shelly. 
LEVENE Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me? 
WILLIAMSON It's not impossible. 
LEVENE On an eighty-thousand dollar day? And it ain't even noon. 
ROMA You closed 'em today? 
LEVENE Yes.  I did.  This morning. (to Williamson) What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's... 
ROMA ...yes... 
LEVENE ...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it. 
ROMA That's right, Shel. 
LEVENE And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you. 
ROMA He's right, Williamson. 
Williamson goes into a side office.  Pause. 
LEVENE It's not right.  I'm sorry, and I'll tell you who's to blame is Mitch and Murray. 
Roma sees something outside the window. 
ROMA (sotto) Oh, Christ. 
LEVENE The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for... 
LINGK That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out. 
ROMA You don't count Saturday. 
LINGK I'm not. 
ROMA No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day. 
LINGK But I'm not counting it. (pause) Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed. 
ROMA What would have elapsed? 
LINGK If we wait till Mon... 
ROMA When did you write the check? 
LINGK Yest... 
ROMA What was yesterday? 
LINGK Tuesday. 
ROMA And when was that check cashed? 
LINGK I don't know. 
ROMA What was the earliest it could have been cashed? 
Pause. 
LINGK I don't know. 
ROMA Today. (pause) Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case. 
LINGK The check wasn't cashed? 
ROMA I just called downtown, and it's on their desk. 
LEVENE Rick... 
ROMA One moment, I'll be right with you. (to Lingk) In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which (looks around) I can't talk to you about here. 
Detective puts his head out of the doorway. 
BAYLEN Levene!!! 
LINGK I, I... 
ROMA Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed. 
BAYLEN Levene! 
ROMA Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed. 
ROMA (to Aaronow) Will you excuse... 
AARONOW Where did Moss...?  I... 
ROMA Will you excuse us please? 
AARONOW Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant? (pause) I...I... (exits) 
ROMA I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you. 
LINGK It's not me, it's my wife. 
ROMA (pause) What is? 
LINGK I told you. 
ROMA Tell me again. 
LINGK What's going on here? 
ROMA Tell me again.  Your wife. 
LINGK I told you. 
ROMA You tell me again. 
LINGK She wants her money back. 
ROMA We're going to speak to her. 
LINGK No.  She told me "right now." 
ROMA We'll speak to her, Jim... 
LINGK She won't listen. 
Detective sticks his head out. 
BAYLEN Roma. 
LINGK She told me if not, I have to call the State's attorney. 
ROMA No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that. 
LINGK She told me I have to. 
ROMA No, Jim. 
LINGK I do.  If I don't get my money back... 
Williamson points out Roma to Baylen. 
BAYLEN Roma! (to Roma) I'm talking to you... 
ROMA Forget the deal, Jimmy. (pause) Forget the deal...you know me.  The deal's dead.  Am I talking about the deal?  That's over.  Please. Let's talk about you.  Come on. (pause.  Roma rises and starts walking toward the front door) Come on. (pause) Come on, Jim. (pause) I want to tell you something.  Your life is your own.  You have a contract with your wife.  You have certain things you do jointly, you have a bond there...and there are other things.  Those things are yours.  You needn't feel ashamed, you needn't feel that you're being untrue...or that she would abandon you if she knew.  This is your life. (pause) Yes.  Now I want to talk to you because you're obviously upset and that concerns me.  Now let's go. Right now. 
Lingk gets up and they start for the door. 
BAYLEN (sticks his head out of the door) Roma... 
LINGK ...and...and... 
Pause. 
ROMA What? 
LINGK And the check is... 
ROMA What did I tell you? (pause) What did I say about the three days...? 
BAYLEN Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch... 
ROMA I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in. (checks watch) I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson. 
BAYLEN The people downtown said... 
ROMA You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...! 
WILLIAMSON Yes. 
ROMA Mr. Lingk and I are going to... 
WILLIAMSON Yes.  Please.  Please. (to Lingk) The police (shrugs) can be... 
LINGK What are the police doing? 
ROMA It's nothing. 
LINGK What are the police doing here...? 
WILLIAMSON We had a slight burglary last night. 
ROMA It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk... 
WILLIAMSON Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to... 
ROMA John... 
WILLIAMSON Your contract went out to the bank. 
LINGK You cashed the check? 
WILLIAMSON We... 
ROMA ...Mr. Williamson... 
WILLIAMSON Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case. 
WILLIAMSON Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours... 
LEVENE I've got the check... 
WILLIAMSON Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless. 
Pause. 
LEVENE The check's no good? 
WILLIAMSON You stick around I'll pull the memo for you. (starts for the door) I'm busy now... 
LEVENE Their check's no good?  They're nuts...? 
WILLIAMSON Call up the bank.  I called them. 
LEVENE You did? 
WILLIAMSON I called them when we had the lead... four months ago. (pause) The people are insane.  They just like talking to salesmen. 
Williamson starts for door. 
LEVENE Don't. 
WILLIAMSON I'm sorry. 
LEVENE Why? 
WILLIAMSON Because I don't like you. 
LEVENE John: John:...my daughter... 
WILLIAMSON Fuck you. 
Roma comes out of the Detective's door.  Williamson goes in. 
ROMA (to Baylen) Asshole... (to Levene) Guy couldn't find his fuckin' couch in the living room...Ah, Christ... what a day, what a day...I haven't even had a cup of coffee...Jagoff John opens his mouth he blows my Cadillac... (sighs) I swear...it's not a world of men... it's not a world of men, Machine... it's a world of clock watchers, bureaucrats, officeholders...what it is, it's a fucked-up world...there's no adventure to it. (pause) Dying breed.  Yes it is. (pause) We are the members of a dying breed. That's...that's...that's why we have to stick together.  Shel: I want to talk to you. (MORE) 
ROMA (CONT'D) I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today? 
LEVENE Me. 
ROMA Yeah. 
LEVENE Mm. 
ROMA Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk? 
LEVENE I think I'd better stay here for a while. 
Baylen sticks his head out of the room: 
BAYLEN Mr. Levene...?

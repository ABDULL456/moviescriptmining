FADE IN: 
1   EXT:   MIDTOWN MANHATTAN STREETS - DAY 
Behind the opening credits, we watch a montage of RUPERT PUPKIN making his daily rounds as a messenger delivering manila envelopes and packages to various New York offices, always courteous and polite in his demeanor, PUPKIN is an attractive-looking young man just past thirty and dressed in a stylish blue suit, broad tie and wide-collared shirt. His shoes are neatly polished, his hair carefully groomed. As the montage continues, we see that he has finished his deliveries and is walking rapidly towards his destination. It turns out to be a television theater north of Times Square whose marquee announces THE JERRY LANGFORD SHOW. It is dusk and the show is about to break. There is a very small crowd already positioned at the stage door -- a few young girls, a few curious passers-by who have stopped to see who will emerge. Three professional autograph hunters are clustered together: 
MAE, a lady in her sixties, wears a red velvet dress, a lace hat and much too much rouge. 
SIDNEY is in his mid-twenties, tall, badly-complexioned, slicked hair but otherwise neatly dressed. He carries a brown lunch bag. 
CELESTE is an enormously fat woman in her mid-thirties. She wears a large cape to conceal her obesity. 
A middle-aged MAN, dressed in a corduroy suit,    emerges from the backstage door which is guarded by a    large, white-haired POLICEMAN. The non-professionals     in the crowd just peer at the MAN but MAE immediately    steps in front of him with her autograph book raised. 
MAE (to the MAN) Are you somebody? 
MAN No, honey, I'm just a working stiff. 
The MAN keep walking and MAE returns to her cohorts just as PUPKIN arrives. 
MAE Hi, Rupert. 
CELESTE (coolly) Hello, Rupert. 
SIDNEY Who did you get? 
PUPKIN (distractedly) Nobody. 
PUPKIN carefully places himself near the door, a step or two away from the other professionals. 
MAE (to SIDNEY) I got Mr. Raf Vallone outside 21. 
CELESTE (to SIDNEY about PUPKIN) He'd never tell you anyway, Sidney. 
MAE Then I got him again at the Pierre at four o'clock. 
SIDNEY Be a dear, Mae. I don't happen to have Mr. Vallone. 
MAE You know what I want for him. 
SIDNEY But I have only six Barbra's left. You know how difficult she is to work with. 
MAE I don't have her even once. 
CELESTE (to MAE) Maybe Rupert would help you. 
PUPKIN shoots a hostile glance back at CELESTE. 
SIDNEY Would you do that, Rupert? You don't feel about Barbra the way I do. 
MAE I'll give you Mr. Burt Reynolds too. 
CELESTE (needling RUPERT) Look, Sidney, Rupert doesn't do that sort of thing. 
SIDNEY How about it, Rupert?   I'll give you whoever you want. 
SIDNEY starts pulling little white cards out of his paper bag and reading them off. 
SIDNEY Rodney    Dangerfield ... Richard Harris    ... Liza Minelli ... and she's    not so easy to work with either    ... Louise Lasser! 
CELESTE You're wasting your time. 
PUPKIN has been trying to remain apart from the other three. Finally he turns to SIDNEY. 
PUPKIN Look, Sidney. I'm just not interested. This isn't my whole life, you know. 
CELESTE What's that supposed to mean -- that it's my whole life, or Sidney's or Mae's? 
MAE It is so my whole life. 
CELESTE Shut up, Mae. What about your mother? Isn't she part of your life? 
MAE It's her whole life too. 
The show breaks. The doors swing open and people pour out. The crowd around the backstage door swells. 
POLICEMAN (to the crowd) If you want Jerry's autograph, give me your piece of paper and I'll send it backstage. 
A number of people in the crowd hand in pieces of paper. PUPKIN is standing next to a young couple, about college age. The YOUNG GIRL has just sent in her paper. 
PUPKIN (to the GIRL) What are you going to do with Jerry's autograph? 
YOUNG GIRL I don't know. Maybe I'll sell it. 
BOYFRIEND I'll tell you what she's going to do with it. She's going to pin 
it on her bulletin board and have an orgasm. 
The YOUNG GIRL laughs unself-consciously. 
CUT TO: 
LANGFORD's limousine waits directly in front of the stage door. MAE has engaged the CHAUFFEUR who stands at the door of the car in conversation. 
PUPKIN Me neither. I just carry them as a courtesy. How about a cough drop? 
LANGFORD (smiling indulgently) No thanks. I don't cough. 
PUPKIN I try not to but sometimes, you know ... Am I making any sense? 
LANGFORD (smiling) Go on. 
PUPKIN Well, that night you did Paar, I walked out of the theater like I was in a dream. All of a sudden, I knew what I wanted. I started catching your guest appearances on Sullivan and taping them and, when you got your own show, it got to be a kind of regular thing. I studied how you built to your one-liners, nice and relaxed like you were chatting, and how you delivered 
the jokes without leaning too much on them, without saying "here's the punchline, folks." And I watched the way you played off dead audiences, how you let those long silences build until people couldn't stand it and then the way you got them off the hook with that slow smile. You were my college of comedy, Jerry, like a kind of teacher, a friend. I know it sounds crazy, but when you watch someone every night ... But that's all in the past. What I'm trying to say is this. I'm ready now. I've finished the course. And I'm thinking as we sit here talking "Is this it? Is this that one big break?" Is it, Jerry? 
There is a long pause. 
PUPKIN Jerry? 
LANGFORD Look ... er ... what was the name? 
PUPKIN I'm Rupert, Jerry. 
LANGFORD Look, Rupert. I know what you're saying. But things don't work that way. You can't just walk onto a network show without any experience. You've got to start at the bottom ... 
PUPKIN But that's where I am! 
LANGFORD You've got to work your way up, learn your trade in front of live audiences, start playing the little clubs. 
PUPKIN But that can take years, Jerry! Look at me. I'm already 31 years old! People my age are way ahead of me. I've got some catching up to do and I need your help. What do you say, Jerry? All I'm asking you to do is listen to my act. That's all. Is that asking too much? 
LANGFORD I get calls from agents every day. All they want ... 
PUPKIN I tried getting an agent.   I did, Jerry. 
But you know how it is. You can't get an agent unless you're working and you can't get work unless you've got an agent ... or unless you know somebody. And the only person I know is you, Jerry. 
There is a long pause. 
LANGFORD Look, why don't you call my office. 
PUPKIN Could I?!? Oh, I knew you'd say that, Jerry. You don't know how many times I've had this conversation in my head. And this is the way it always turns out. That's why I had to sort of invite myself into the car tonight. I know it's kind of presumptuous and I really appreciate the time you've given me. But breaks like this don't just happen. You have to make your own breaks. 
The limousine starts slowing down as it pulls up before U.N. Plaza. It stops. LANGFORD gets out. PUPKIN follows. 
3   EXT:   U.N. PLAZA APARTMENTS - NIGHT 
LANGFORD turn to PUPKIN,    looking to get rid of him as cleanly and gracefully as    possible. LANGFORD extends his hand. PUPKIN goes to     shake it but his hand is wrapped in the handkerchief. He     extends his left hand. LANGFORD shakes it awkwardly. 
LANGFORD Nice meeting you, Rupert.   I hope it all works out for you. 
PUPKIN Thanks, Jerry. I don't know how to repay you. I'm a little short on cash this evening, but, if you don't mind some good, hearty food, I'd be honored to take you to dinner. 
LANGFORD Thanks, but some people are waiting for me. 
PUPKIN Oh, I understand. Well, then, maybe I could repay you with a joke. 
LANGFORD is starting to walk into the building. 
PUPKIN Wait a minute. How's this? The      first night you do your show from the coast,    you open this way. "Good evening, ladies    and gentlemen, it's great to be back    here in 
Southern California where you can wake up in the morning and listen to the birds coughing ... " 
LANGFORD (nodding but unsmiling) Not bad. Maybe. 
PUPKIN calls after LANGFORD who heads for the entrance to his building. 
PUPKIN Consider it a gift. Hey, Jerry! How about lunch? My treat! 
LANGFORD (turning back before he enters the building) Call my office. 
PUPKIN waves with his bandaged hand, notices LANGFORD's handkerchief and unwraps it. 
PUPKIN (to the handkerchief) Thanks, Jerry. 
The CAMERA MOVES IN for a CLOSE-UP of PUPKIN in a kind of daze. 
FADE TO: 
4   INT:   SARDI'S RESTAURANT - DAY 
PUPKIN and LANGFORD stand at the edge of the foyer, waiting for the Maitre d' to seat them. VINCENT, the owner, spots them and hurries over. 
VINCENT I'm sorry, Mr. Langford. (To PUPKIN, angrily) How did you get in? 
LANGFORD That's alright, Vincent.   Mr. Pupkin's a friend of mine. 
VINCENT (puzzled) Oh, I see. 
PUPKIN That's alright. Now if you'd be good enough to find us a nice table. 
PUPKIN pushes a five dollar bill into VINCENT's hand. 
VINCENT Certainly.   This way, please. 
VINCENT leads PUPKIN and LANGFORD to the "bullpen," a select spot in a corner of the restaurant. 
5   EXT:   U.N. PLAZA - NIGHT 
PUPKIN Thanks, Jerry. 
PUPKIN takes LANGFORD's handkerchief and folds it reverentially, tucking it carefully into his breast pocket. He claps his hands together a few times for joy and dashes into the street to hail a cab. 
CUT TO: 
6   INT:   LANGFORD'S APARTMENT 
LANGFORD enters his apartment. It is tasteful, modern, spacious and empty. A floodlight shines on a single setting at the end of a long dinner table. He walks over to a large aquarium and sprinkles some food for the fish. 
LANGFORD (to the fish) Say hello to Jerry. 
On a shelf above the aquarium stand three pictures, one of two boys, roughly eight and eleven, flanked by a shot of each boy alone. LANGFORD walks to the end of the table where a covered dish and a New York Post await him. He lifts the covered dish which reveals a large, cold salmon. 
LANGFORD (to the fish) Say hello to Jerry. 
LANGFORD begins poking at the fish with his fork.    The phone rings. He answers it. 
LANGFORD Yeah. 
GIRL'S VOICE It's Marsha, Jerry. Did you get my note? I left it on the back seat. Did you get it? I dropped it there before they pulled me out. Those guys hurt me, Jerry. (pause) Jerry? 
LANGFORD (icily) Who gave you this number? 
MARSHA'S VOICE Don't be    angry with me, Jerry. I didn't know what    else to do; I've been trying you every    five minutes, I miss you, baby ...    Jerry? 
LANGFORD hangs up the phone and then takes it off the receiver. 
LANGFORD 
Say goodbye to Jerry. 
He shakes his head wearily, returns to his dinner and turns to the inside pages of the New York Post. 
CUT TO: 
7    EXT:   LEXINGTON AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - NIGHT 
A cab pulls up in front of an all-night florist shop. PUPKIN dashes out of the cab and into the florist's. The cab waits. 
CUT TO: 
8    EXT:   LEXINGTON AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - NIGHT 
PUPKIN dashes out of the florist's clutching a single red rose. He hops back into the cab which starts moving. 
CUT TO: 
9    EXT:   A STREET OFF BROADWAY - NIGHT 
The cab pulls up in front of Gil's Steaks and Chops, a restaurant of little distinction that has a few checkered tableclothed tables in the rear and a long bar at the front. PUPKIN stares through the window of the bar at RITA, the bargirl, an attractive, somewhat shopworn blonde in her late twenties. PUPKIN enters. 
CUT TO: 
10   INT:   BAR-RESTAURANT 
PUPKIN goes to the near end of the sparsely-populated bar. 
PUPKIN Miss! 
RITA comes over.    PUPKIN smiles knowingly. 
PUPKIN A beer please, Miss.    Something imported. 
RITA Heineken's alright? 
PUPKIN Fine. 
RITA serves him a Heineken's.     She stares at him, searching his face. 
PUPKIN How have you been, Rita? 
She stares again. 
RITA You're not Rupert Pupkin! 
PUPKIN smiles broadly. 
RITA How the hell did you find me? 
PUPKIN Sally Gardner, I met her after a matinee. Aren't you glad to see me? 
RITA Sure, sure.    How is old Sally? 
PUPKIN The same, I guess. You know, two kids, a nice husband, living in Clifton. 
RITA It figures. 
PUPKIN A lot of the kids in our class have moved back. 
RITA What are you doing here? 
MAN Rita! 
RITA (to PUPKIN) Excuse me a minute, honey. 
PUPKIN I'm not honey! I'm Rupert. 
RITA goes to the far end of the bar and serves the MAN a beer. They chat briefly as PUPKIN watches uneasily. Finally PUPKIN downs his beer and raises his glass. 
PUPKIN Miss!     Miss! 
The MAN gets RITA's attention for PUPKIN.   RITA returns to PUPKIN and serves him another beer. 
PUPKIN I'm in the mood to celebrate tonight. Why don't we go to this nice restaurant I know, talk over and times, get to know each other all over again. 
RITA And then? 
PUPKIN Well, tomorrow night I thought we'd go out again, talk some more, get to know each other even better. 
RITA How much? 
PUPKIN How much what? 
RITA How much do we have to get to know each other? 
PUPKIN I don't understand. 
RITA (emphatically) How much do we have to get to know each other before we start talking about that job? 
PUPKIN I'm not talking about any job. 
RITA Then what's this big offer you were talking about? 
PUPKIN You'll see.    Right now I'm asking you for a date.    How about it? 
RITA I'm sorry, Rupert.     But I'm busy. 
PUPKIN Busy? 
RITA Yeah.   Busy. 
PUPKIN But this is the biggest night of my life. 
RITA I've already got a date. 
The MAN at the end of the bar raises his glass. 
MAN Rita! 
RITA goes to the far end of the bar. She pours him another beer and settles against the bar, resuming her chat with him. PUPKIN looks for a moment and downs his beer. He raises his glass. 
PUPKIN Miss!   Miss! 
RITA returns to him. 
PUPKIN Is that your date? 
RITA None of your business. 
PUPKIN What do you want to go out with him for? 
RITA He's a good friend of mine. 
PUPKIN Tell him you're busy. 
RITA What's so important about tonight? 
PUPKIN Everything!    You don't understand. 
RITA No. I don't. It's been really nice seeing you, Rupert. Thanks for dropping in. But I've got some work to do. 
RITA leaves PUPKIN and returns to the far end of the bar where she once again resumes talking with the MAN. PUPKIN sits for a moment, gets up slowly and heads for the john. 
11   INT:   THE JOHN - NIGHT 
He enters the john and goes to the farthest of the three urinals. A moment later, the MAN enters. He goes to the nearest of the three urinals. The two men stare at the wall before them but the obvious tension between them renders them both incapable of relieving themselves. PUPKIN glances over at the MAN's face, then immediately turns back to the wall as the MAN turns to look at him. The MAN glances quickly at PUPKIN and then returns to staring at the wall. PUPKIN sneaks a furtive glance at the MAN's penis. The MAN sneaks a furtive glance at PUPKIN's penis. 
CUT TO: 
12   INT:   THE BAR - NIGHT 
PUPKIN emerges from the john, followed a moment later by the MAN. They resume their seats at each end of the bar. A third MAN has come in and is seated midway between PUPKIN and the MAN. 
PUPKIN Miss! 
RITA walks over reluctantly. 
PUPKIN Listen to me for a second. 
RITA I have work to do, Rupert. 
PUPKIN Just listen. I'm at the start     of something really big. I don't     want to talk about it here but it's    going to happen soon and it's going    to be great -- for both of us. 
RITA No kidding? 
RITA Well, I guess it won't kill me. 
PUPKIN This is supposed to be the finest Cantonese cuisine in the city. 
RITA Yeah? Then what happened to the tablecloths? 
PUPKIN drops his eyes. 
RITA Oh, don't worry about it.   This is 
fine. (She takes a long drink) I'm having a good time. So you've been devoted to me, huh? 
PUPKIN I used to see you at the Garden every year. 
RITA Oh, the Follies. That was the right name for 'em. How did you know which one was me? We all looked like chickens. What I mean is, we all looked like the same chicken. I thought it was gonna be Rita Keane in the Ice Follies and I wind up looking like Henny Penny. 
RITA chuckles to herself. 
PUPKIN You just didn't get the breaks. 
RITA Breaks, bullshit! My parents didn't have the money for the right coach. But what difference does it make? 
She starts laughing to herself. 
RITA I remember once we were down in Atlanta and the ice machine broke down. We did three hours of slush. Everyone was falling on their faces and hopping up with their arms open for a bow like the whole thing was planned. And the people ate it up. 
PUPKIN I liked the show. 
RITA Yeah? The Follies? You really must have been carrying the torch. What did you think when I got married? You knew I got married? 
PUPKIN I knew it wouldn't last. 
RITA You think I should have married you, instead, huh? 
PUPKIN Peter Drysdale!     Really, Rita! 
RITA 
If he'd only been hit by a train. He was worth a helluva lot more dead than alive, I can tell you that. 
RITA raises her glass to the WAITER who is standing nearby, talking with another WAITER. As she does, a nice-looking young MAN sitting in the middle aisle raises his glass of beer to her and drinks it, as a kind of toast. RITA smiles briefly and her eyes return to PUPKIN. The YOUNG MAN is seated behind PUPKIN, facing RITA. The WAITER comes over and collects the glass. Throughout the rest of the scene, a subtle flirtation continues between RITA and the YOUNG MAN. 
PUPKIN Are you seeing anyone? 
RITA starts for a moment, thinking PUPKIN has caught her looking at the YOUNG MAN. 
RITA What do you mean? 
PUPKIN I want to know about the competition, that's all. 
RITA Well, tomorrow night, I've got a date with Joe Namath -- you know Joe. And Thursday --- let's see -- 
PUPKIN I'm serious, Rita. 
RITA (imitating him) I'm serious, Rita. (In her own voice) Sure I see people. I'm not a nun, Rupert. I see a lot of people. 
PUPKIN Anyone special? 
RITA (chuckling) You mean am I "going steady"?   Rupert, I'm thirty-one years old! 
PUPKIN What about that guy tonight? 
RITA Him? 
PUPKIN Why him? 
RITA What am I supposed to do, huh? Sit home watching TV? He's just some guy. He's got his own aluminum siding business. He comes into the city sometimes, that's all. 
PUPKIN You don't go out with him for his money?!? 
RITA Oh, horrors! Look, Rupert, what do you think they pay me in that dump? Ninety-five bucks. And you don't get the world's greatest tippers in there either. Somebody has to take care of me. 
PUPKIN That's what I want to talk to you about, Rita. 
The WAITER arrives with RITA's drink. 
PUPKIN Who's your favorite movie star? 
RITA You are, Rupert.     Especially your nose. 
PUPKIN Just tell me. 
RITA Is this some kind of game? Are you going to tell me something about my character? 
PUPKIN You'll see.    Give me his name. 
RITA I can't think of anybody. 
PUPKIN You've got to have one, Rita. Everybody does. 
RITA Okay. Okay. Let's see.       (pause) Marilyn Monroe. 
PUPKIN slowly pulls out a leather-bound book from his inside jacket pocket. 
The telephone at the back of the restaurant starts ringing. A WAITER in the background moves slowly to answer it. 
PUPKIN You going to spend the rest of your life in that place? Is that what you really want, talking about nothing with nothings? I thought you wanted something a little better than that and that's what I'm offering. Every King needs a Queen, Rita. I want you to be mine. What do you say? 
RITA You really want to help me out? You see this. (She points to her lower back molar) A hundred seventy-five bucks. If you could spare fifty, say, until next Monday, that would keep three people really happy -- me, my landlord and my dentist. 
During RITA's speech, the WAITER has been working his way from the phone booth towards the front of the restaurant. 
WAITER Telephone for you, Miss. 
RITA (looking puzzled) Me? Nobody knows I'm here.   You didn't tell anybody, did you? 
PUPKIN No. 
RITA (getting up) What the hell's going on? 
CAMERA FOLLOWS RITA, who walks to the back of the restaurant and picks up the dangling receiver in one of 
the two facing booths, the other of which is occupied. 
14   INT:   THE PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT 
RITA Hello? 
MAN'S VOICE Hi. 
RITA Who is this? 
MAN'S VOICE Who do you think it is? I've been staring at you all evening. 
RITA Where are you? 
The YOUNG MAN taps forcefully with his index finger on the glass door of his booth. RITA, hearing the noise, turns around and finds herself staring at the YOUNG MAN. She smiles. 
CUT TO: 
15   INT:   THE RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
PUPKIN at the table looking over the check. He gets out a ten dollar bill. RITA emerges from the booth in nervous high spirits. 
RITA (with repressed gaiety) You know who that was -- the bar.       I have to go back to work. 
PUPKIN How did they know you were here? 
RITA (gathering her things) I guess I must have told them.      They need someone right away. 
PUPKIN (accusingly) You don't even care, do you? 
RITA Oh, no.   I do. Really! 
PUPKIN It's not the bar, Rita.    Don't tell me it's the bar. 
RITA 
Don't be angry. It has nothing to do with you. I had a nice dinner, really. It was great seeing you again. 
PUPKIN stare at her icily. 
RITA Come on.    Let's see a smile. 
PUPKIN Why don't we finish the evening up at the bar together? End the evening where it began? 
RITA After what happened there? 
PUPKIN Well, I could at least drop you off! 
RITA (hurriedly making up her face) That's okay. Really. I can manage. Why don't you just go to a movie or something? Don't let me spoil your evening. 
PUPKIN But that wouldn't be right. 
RITA gets up and stands before PUPKIN. 
RITA (firmly) Look, Rupert. It's been a lot of fun, really. I'll see you sometime, huh? 
PUPKIN But Rita! 
RITA starts moving towards the door. 
RITA Come on, Rupert.      I'm in a hurry. 
RITA marches out with PUPKIN trailing behind. He throws the check and the ten dollar bill at the CASHIER. 
16   EXT.   THE STREET - NIGHT 
CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN as he streaks out the door and jumps into the adjacent doorway, immediately peering down the street. He spies the YOUNG MAN and RITA walking about three quarters of a block down and follows them, keeping out of sight. They turn occasionally to see if he's around, then stop turning. They go around the corner and disappear into a large apartment building. PUPKIN rushes 
after them,   positioning himself across from    the building. He searches   the windows for some clue as to    where they have gone.    Finally a set of lights go on on    the fourth floor and a   MAN's shadow is seen closing two    sets of blinds. 
CUT TO: 
17   INT:   THE APARTMENT BUILDING FOYER - NIGHT 
PUPKIN enters the building and finds himself in a small entranceway. The door to the lobby is locked. Next to the door, on the wall, are listed the tenants, their apartment numbers and a button next to each name. There is an intercom speaker. There are eight apartments listed on the fourth floor, running from 4A to 4H. PUPKIN looks them over, takes a deep breath and pushes 4A. 
CUT TO: 
22   INT:   YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
RITA and the YOUNG MAN are seated on the couch. Still no buzzer. As the YOUNG MAN talks, RITA is staring at a woman's shoe lying underneath a small table that holds a lamp. 
YOUNG MAN Did you know that you have remarkable hair? 
RITA Yeah? You know what?       I feel like going to a movie. 
YOUNG MAN Now? 
RITA Sure. Why not? It's only twenty of ten. We can make a ten o'clock show. 
The YOUNG MAN takes her hands and looks deep into her eyes. 
YOUNG MAN Why don't we make our own movie? 
RITA No.    I don't think so. 
YOUNG MAN Don't be so uptight. Give it a chance. 
RITA I want to go to the movies, that's all. 
YOUNG MAN We can go to the movies later. 
RITA pulls her hands away. 
RITA Let's stop playing games, okay. I'm not a kid. 
YOUNG MAN You have something against pleasure? 
RITA 
I'm just not interested in being tonight's ritual sacrifice, okay? 
YOUNG MAN Shall I freshen up your drink? 
RITA shakes her head. 
YOUNG MAN (growing irritated) What exactly did you think we were going to do up here? 
CUT TO: 
23   INT:   THE ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT 
PUPKIN pushes 4D and waits. 
MAN'S VOICE Yeah? 
CUT TO: 
24   INT:   YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The YOUNG MAN is practically sitting on RITA's lap.   He has RITA backed up against the end of the couch. 
YOUNG MAN Look, if you've got sexual problems let's talk about them. It helps clear the air. 
RITA There's nothing wrong with me. 
YOUNG MAN Then it's me? 
RITA I don't even know you. 
YOUNG MAN Then find out. Sex is a great way of breaking down barriers. 
RITA I don't think so. 
YOUNG MAN I'm sure this could lead to something beautiful. 
The YOUNG MAN kisses RITA roughly. 
YOUNG MAN Passive resistance, huh? 
RITA Let's just write this thing off as a big mistake. What do you say? 
YOUNG MAN What's wrong with me? 
RITA Nothing.   I just want to go home. 
YOUNG MAN I can see I'm not turning you on. 
RITA (smiles) You noticed that, huh? 
YOUNG MAN Come on.   What's wrong with me? 
RITA You really want to know? 
YOUNG MAN Yeah. 
RITA How can I put it? Well, it's like you've got your fly open and your tongue hanging out. 
CUT TO: 
CUT TO: 
32   EXT: WEST 56th STREET BETWEEN EIGHTH AND NINTH AVENUES - NIGHT 
WE SEE the taxi pull up in front of one of those middle- 
class tenements -- a fairly well-preserved six-story building with a fire escape running up the front. PUPKIN helps RITA out of the taxi. A dime bounces at PUPKIN's feet. 
CAB DRIVER'S VOICE Stuff it, big spender! 
PUPKIN pays no attention.   He walks RITA to her front stoop. 
RITA Well, I guess you're entitled to come up for coffee. 
PUPKIN That's okay, Rita. You're tired and I know I'm not always the easiest guy to be with. 
There is a pause. 
RITA (puzzled) What do you want, Rupert? 
PUPKIN (softly) You don't understand anything, do you? I love you, Rita. I want to change your life ... if you'll only give me a chance. 
RITA just shakes her head sadly. 
PUPKIN Look, what if I arranged it so you could meet Jerry? You'd have to believe me if you heard it from him. 
RITA There's no ... 
PUPKIN I'll arrange that, Rita. We'll all go out to dinner some night or maybe out to his place, on a weekend. You'll see. The trouble with you is you've got no faith. Now go to bed and get a good rest and I'll see you in a couple of days. 
PUPKIN gives RITA a very gentle, sweet kiss on the forehead. 
PUPKIN (gently) Now run along in. 
RITA just stares at him. 
PUPKIN Go on. 
RITA turns slowly and goes in.       She looks back.   PUPKIN is gone. 
FADE TO: 
33   EXT:   MADISON AVENUE AND 48th STREET - DAY 
PUPKIN carries a large manila folder into 424 Madison.        As usual, he is impeccably dressed. 
CUT TO: 
34   INT:   OFFICES OF KOERNER-LIBERMAN TRAVEL - DAY 
It is a large corner office, broken up by glass dividers. A RECEPTIONIST sits at a desk facing the door. PUPKIN enters. 
RECEPTIONIST Yes. 
PUPKIN hands the RECEPTIONIST the package. 
PUPKIN I need somebody to sign. You can sign anything you want -- Cary Grant, Art Carney, I don't care. 
The RECEPTIONIST signs. 
PUPKIN Would you mind very much if I used your phone? It's local. 
RECEPTIONIST Don't be, long. Dial nine. 
PUPKIN takes out a little piece of paper from his suit pocket and dials a number. 
PUPKIN (tense, nervous) May I speak to Jerry Langford, please? Thanks ... Jerry Langford, please. Rupert Pupkin ... Jerry knows. I'm calling at his request ... I see. That's alright. I'll call him again. 
RECEPTIONIST That's not Jerry Langford, the ... 
PUPKIN (smiling proudly) 
That's right.   Thanks for your phone. 
CUT TO: 
35   EXT:   TIMES SQUARE - DAY 
PUPKIN approaches Times Square phone booth. He rests a few folders on a trash basket just outside the booth. He enters the booth and dials. 
PUPKIN Jerry Langford, please ... May I speak to Jerry Langford, please ... Rupert Pupkin, I called earlier ... I see. How long do you expect that'll last? Oh, fine. I'm at (PUPKIN checks the number on the phone) CH 4-1482 ... I'll be here for another half hour, forty- five minutes. Please be sure he gets my message. Thanks. 
PUPKIN hangs up.

36   EXT:   TIMES SQUARE - DAY 
A SHOT of the clock on the Allied Chemical Building. It reads 10:10. A nearby record store starts blasting music into the street through a loudspeaker. The music serves as background for a montage in which we CUT BETWEEN the clock, which moves in bites towards 11:30 to Broadway as it looks to PUPKIN in the booth -- that cavalcade of hustlers, whores, housewives, kids, weirdos and working people; and SHOTS of various people waiting to use the phone -- their impatience, anger, disgust. Each time one of them arrives, PUPKIN pretends to thumb through the phone book and dial a number. WE WATCH him chatting with animation until the waiting party leaves. Then WE SEE him push the coin return to retrieve his dime. Finally, PUPKIN takes a last look at the clock.   WE SEE that it reads 11:30. He leaves the booth and goes to the trash basket. His packages have been swiped.

CATHY LONG I'm Bert Thomas' assistant. 
PUPKIN Bert Thomas? 
CATHY LONG He's our executive producer. 
PUPKIN Oh, yes. I'm sure he is. But, you see, I've already talked directly with Jerry about my being on the show and he told me to get in touch with him. I'm just here to follow up on that. 
CATHY LONG What do you do, Mr. Pupkin? 
PUPKIN 
Stand-up comedy. 
CATHY LONG Fine.    Where are you working? 
PUPKIN Well, right now I'm developing new material. 
CATHY    LONG I see. Well, as     soon as you start performing again,    let us know where you are and I'll    send my assistant down to check you    out. 
PUPKIN Sure. Sure. But that's not necessary, Miss Long. Jerry and I already went over all this. 
CATHY LONG Does Jerry know your work? 
PUPKIN (nodding) Yes.    I don't think he does. 
CATHY LONG You don't happen to have a tape or a demo that we might listen to? 
PUPKIN Oh, sure. I've got lots of tapes. That's no problem. 
CATHY LONG Good. Why don't you just send one to us and I assure you we'll listen to it promptly. 
PUPKIN Great. I'll do that. I can see that'd be a lot easier for Jerry. Thanks a lot, Miss Long. 
CATHY LONG Don't mention it, Mr. Pupkin.     Now, if you'd excuse me ... 
PUPKIN Sure.    Sure. Thanks again. 
CATHY LONG leaves. PUPKIN, left standing there, smiles at the RECEPTIONIST who returns another professional smile. 
PUPKIN (to the RECEPTIONIST) Thanks. 
CUT TO: 
42   EXT:   THE UPPER-BROADWAY HIGH-RISE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 
PUPKIN comes out of the building elated. He is immediately confronted by MARSHA. PUPKIN continues to walk as MARSHA skips beside him. 
MARSHA I've got to speak to you for a minute. I'm Marsha. 
PUPKIN Yeah.   I know. 
MARSHA Look. Did Jerry say anything about me last night? 
PUPKIN I'm really in a hurry, Marsha ... 
MARSHA Was he angry? ... In the car last night, I saw you. Did he talk about me? 
PUPKIN I thought that was you.     That was some stunt. 
MARSHA What did he say? 
PUPKIN We didn't talk about you. 
MARSHA You know Jerry? 
PUPKIN Yeah. 
MARSHA thrusts an envelope into PUPKIN's hands. 
MARSHA Give him this for me. 
PUPKIN Why don't you ... 
MARSHA Because I can't! Please. I need your help. You'll be my friend forever. Come on. I'll buy you something. What do you want? 
She takes a great messy bunch of bills out of her raincoat 
pockets and jams them into PUPKIN's hands. 
PUPKIN I don't want this. 
MARSHA Take it.   I can get all I want. 
PUPKIN shrugs and pockets the money. 
PUPKIN Okay.   I'll try. 
MARSHA (turning cold) Don't try. Do it.       Remember.   We just made a deal. 
PUPKIN stares at the envelope. 
MARSHA And don't open it.    It's private. 
CATHY LONG Yes? 
PUPKIN (suddenly a bit shy) I didn't want to take any chances with this ... uh ... Miss Long, so I ... uh ... thought I'd just bring it here myself. 
He hands CATHY LONG the package as though it contained nitroglycerine. 
CATHY LONG We talked about this this morning, did we, Mr. ... ? 
PUPKIN Pupkin.   Rupert Pupkin. 
CATHY LONG Oh, yes. It's been some day. (pause) Well, I certainly appreciate your bringing this over, Mr. Pupkin, and we'll listen to it as soon as possible. 
PUPKIN Fine. Er ... you don't have any idea how soon that might be? 
CATHY LONG Well, you can try checking with us tomorrow. We might know something by then. Otherwise, it'll have to be Monday. 
PUPKIN What if I just sort of waited around here today, just in case? I'll stay out of the way. 
CATHY LONG You'd just be wasting your time, Mr. Pupkin. We won't know anything until tomorrow at the earliest. 
PUPKIN Oh, I wouldn't consider it a waste of 
time at all.    I'd be glad to do it. 
CATHY LONG Look, why don't you try us tomorrow. Okay? 
PUPKIN Tomorrow? ... Right. I'll do that. Thanks a lot, Miss Long. And thank Jerry. 
CATHY LONG smiles at     PUPKIN and    goes, leaving PUPKIN staring at a picture     of LANGFORD    on the wall. WE FIX on LANGFORD a moment and     PULL BACK    to see LANGFORD in what PUPKIN would imagine     his office    to be. 
48   INT:   AN OFFICE - DAY 
A large, corner office furnished in royal red, with high ceilings and a huge desk. Potted palms and hydrangeas rest on a marble floor. LANGFORD is moving about restlessly, clutching PUPKIN's tape in one hand and waving it about. PUPKIN is seated on a comfortable couch. 
LANGFORD Dynamite!    This is dynamite! 
PUPKIN (shyly) You think so, Jerry? 
LANGFORD Look, I've been at this for fifteen years, Rupert, and I haven't come up with anything like this -- not me, not any of my writers. 
PUPKIN (smiling with obvious pleasure) Well, I'm glad you like it, Jerry. 
LANGFORD Tell me something, Rube. (pause) How do you do it? I'm not asking to use the material myself. I just want to know how you (LANGFORD waves his arms in a gesture of frustration) how you do it. 
PUPKIN Well, I don't know if I can explain it, really. 
LANGFORD Come on.    Try, Rube. 
PUPKIN 
Well,    it just sort of comes. I think about    my life, see, mainly about the worst    parts, all the awful things, and I just    try to see them in a funny light. That's    all. 
LANGFORD (eagerly) Is that what you do? The worst parts, and then you look at them in a funny light? Is that what you do? 
PUPKIN More or less. It's hard to describe how its happens. 
LANGFORD But that's just it, Rube. It doesn't happen for me. Why do you think the show is in so much trouble? By the time I've done my monologue, everyone has switched to Carson. Maybe if you did a little writing ... ? 
PUPKIN Sure, Jerry, I'd do anything I could to help out. 
LANGFORD You would? Great. Why don't you come out to my place this weekend and we'll hash it out. I'm having a few of my friends but we should be able to get a little work in. 
PUPKIN Would you mind if I brought someone? 
LANGFORD (smiling) A girl, Rube? 
PUPKIN A very special girl, Jerry. 
LANGFORD I'd love to meet her. 
49   THE HIGH-RISE OFFICE BUILDING ON UPPER BROADWAY - DAY 
PUPKIN emerges, lost in thought. Suddenly he notices MARSHA waiting nearby. She doesn't see PUPKIN. He sneaks off. 
CUT TO: 
50   EXT:   U.N. PLAZA - DAY 
It is a bright morning. LANGFORD, attempting to camouflage himself by wearing a cap over his eyes and his trench coat collar turned up, his eyes hidden behind dark glasses, walks out of the building. A DOORMAN is standing by the door. 
DOORMAN Cab, Jerry? 
LANGFORD That's alright, thanks. 
WE FOLLOW LANGFORD as he walks. Some people don't notice. Others stare but leave him alone, a few commenting to their companions and pointing at him. A CAB DRIVER pulls alongside. 
DRIVER Hey, Jerry. My brother can sing and juggle at the same time. How about puttin' him on your show? 
LANGFORD keeps walking. 
DRIVER How about it, Jerry? 
LANGFORD Sorry, I'm off duty. 
Jonno nods politely but uncertainly. 
JONNO (uncertain) Mr. Langford asked you to come? 
PUPKIN That's right. Would you mind taking those up? Jerry and I have some work that may oblige me to stay overnight. 
JONNO But Mr. Langford's not here. 
PUPKIN Out playing golf, right? 
JONNO (still puzzled and unsure) That's right. 
PUPKIN Maybe he'll finally break a hundred. 
JONNO Maybe it's better if you came back ... 
PUPKIN (interrupting) That's alright. We don't mind waiting. 
PUPKIN walks from the foyer into the living-room, leaving JONNO staring after him holding the bags. RITA walks into the living room after PUPKIN. 
RITA (worried) The table's only set for one. 
PUPKIN That's from breakfast.     Relax, will you? 
CUT TO: 
69   INT:   LANGFORD'S KITCHEN - DAY 
JONNO is on the phone.   A black lady COOK stands at his side. 
JONNO (into the phone) Let me talk to Jerry Langford please ... I know he is ... It's important. 
CUT TO: 
70   INT:   LANGFORD'S LIVING ROOM - DAY 
It is a handsomely furnished room, done in old American antiques and other tasteful pieces. There is a grand piano heavy with pictures in one corner and wall-to-wall bookshelves that are mostly full and mixed with a balance of classics and modern popular reading. The whole room marks LANGFORD as a man of discernment. The shelves also house a fine stereo and a small, discreet bar. RITA and PUPKIN walk in like strangers in paradise, awed by the obvious elegance and expense the room reflects. 
PUPKIN (as though he owned it) How do you like it? 
RITA (admiringly) I could live here. 
PUPKIN (smiling proudly) It's the only way to live. 
RITA stands in the center of the room, ill at ease, while PUPKIN strolls about comfortably, picking up an ashtray here, a cigarette case there, inspecting the artifacts for inscriptions, clues, hints about LANGFORD's character and life. 
RITA How come he isn't here? 
PUPKIN You heard the guy.     He's out playing golf. 
RITA Didn't you tell him when we'd get here? 
PUPKIN continues to move about the room, fielding RITA's suspicious inquiries effortlessly. 
PUPKIN We didn't have time to iron out the details. Now just relax. We're the first guests, that's all. 
RITA (interrupting) That Jonno character hadn't even heard of us! 
PUPKIN (a little irritated) It probably slipped Jerry's mind. He has better things to think about than what he tells his houseboy. 
RITA It's just not time way I expected it, that's all. 
There is a pause. PUPKIN continues his investigation.      He has moved to the grand piano in the rear of the room. 
RITA What do we do now? 
PUPKIN is looking    at a picture of an American Gothic couple standing in front    of a wood-frame house. As he comments on the pictures, the    CAMERA PANS over them. They form a kind of slide-show of    LANGFORD's life. 
PUPKIN These are Jerry's parents. His father runs the Post office in Wolverine -- that's in North Dakota. 
PUPKIN then fixes on a picture of an eleven-year-old boy standing next to a puppet stage with a puppet (obviously held by the boy) staring at its master. 
PUPKIN This one was in Newsweek. He started giving these puppet shows when he was still in grade school. 
WE SEE a picture of a very young LANGFORD seated before a microphone with some celebrity. 
PUPKIN And this is from his quiz show in St. Louis. Can you believe it? 
RITA Sure I can. 
PUPKIN That was the name of the show. 
WE MOVE to a picture of LANGFORD smiling at JACK PAAR. 
PUPKIN And here's when he wrote for Jack Paar. He made a hundred and fifty a week and look at him now. 
Another picture of LANGFORD with a group of women sitting in a studio. 
PUPKIN And this is his morning show. 
A picture of LANGFORD standing in a park with his two boys, eleven and eight. 
PUPKIN And his kids. He's divorced. 
LANGFORD realizes he is being hard.    He stops for a moment. 
LANGFORD I have my own life, that's all. 
PUPKIN But what about me, Jerry? What about my life? I made plans -- based on what you said. You can't just turn your back on me. 
LANGFORD I'm not telling you again. 
There is a long pause as the truth finally sinks in. PUPKIN just stares at LANGFORD with disbelief that turns to anger. 
PUPKIN So this is the way it   works when you're big, huh? You    just play with people. Is that part    of the kick, Jerry? (pause) I can     see I was all wrong about you. All    wrong. 
RITA starts tugging at PUPKIN. 
RITA Come on, Rupert. 
PUPKIN (to RITA) Shut up! (to LANGFORD) You weren't my friend at all, were you? You were just playing some kind of game with me. Well, that's not going to stop me, Jerry. I'm just going to work a little bit harder, that's all, use a little bit more enterprise. And not count on anybody. That's where I made my mistake. I can see that now. 
PUPKIN picks up the pair of small suitcases. 
PUPKIN (glaring at LANGFORD) Come on, Rita. We're wasting our time. 
CUT TO: 
79   EXT.   LANGFORD'S FRONT DOOR - DAY 
PUPKIN strides out with RITA following.     She casts LANGFORD an apologetic glance as she goes. The     door slams behind them. They walk down the path silently     for a few moments as the CAMERA PULLS UP, following them    in an OVERHEAD SHOT. We hear them start talking as they make    their way towards the gate. 
RITA (baffled and angry) What did you think was going to happen? You think he'd just ... ? What's the matter with you? (pause) You can't just walk into a guy's house! And what about me? What did you ... 
PUPKIN (interrupting in a calm but firm voice) Shut up, Rita. I'm thinking.

CUT TO: 
81   INT:   A NEW MERCEDES BENZ - DAY 
MARSHA sits at the wheel of this lavishly appointed sedan, her face made up as though she were going to a fancy party. PUPKIN sits on the other side of the front seat. His ex- 
pression has changed somewhat from the PUPKIN we have seen. He is less wide-eyed, less innocent, tougher. 
MARSHA (whining) How much longer?!? 
PUPKIN Do you want him or not? 
There is a pause. 
MARSHA You sure he's in there? 
PUPKIN Certain. 
MARSHA (with obvious delight) My parents are going to be furious! 
PUPKIN pulls a toy revolver from his jacket pocket and looks it over. MARSHA glances at it. 
MARSHA It looks real. 
PUPKIN That's the whole point. (gesturing with his head towards the entrance of the building which is some 50 yards away) Pay attention. 
MARSHA looks towards the entrance.   A few beats pass. 
MARSHA What if he doesn't come down? 
PUPKIN He will. 
MARSHA But what if he doesn't? 
PUPKIN We'll come back tomorrow. 
MARSHA And wait again? 
PUPKIN Look, you're going to have him all to yourself. What else do you want? 
A MAN resembling LANGFORD walks out the entrance. 
PUPKIN 
Is that him?!? 
MARSHA No. 
PUPKIN You sure? 
MARSHA Sure I'm sure. That looks too much like him. 
PUPKIN What do you mean? 
MARSHA When it's him it doesn't look like him. 
PUPKIN Keep watching. 
of the moment thing.    Give me a little credit, will you. 
PUPKIN looks over to a small phone table with a chair next to it. He motions to it with his head. 
PUPKIN (to LANGFORD) Sit down. 
LANGFORD docilely sits by the phone. 
PUPKIN Now, you're going to call your office and tell them this: that unless a man who identifies himself as the King is allowed on the show tonight as the first guest, they'll never see you alive again. 
LANGFORD What? 
PUPKIN I'll say it again ...

CUT TO: 
91   INT:   A CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
THOMAS, a young, trim executive in his late thirties, in modish dress, sits at the table with several other PEOPLE, including CATHY LONG. They are sipping coffee from con- tainers. There are memos and lists and other papers on the table. The SECRETARY stands at the doorway. THOMAS and the others are looking up at her. 
SECRETARY He says it's urgent. 
THOMAS (smiling) Yeah? Well, tell him I'll call him back. (to the others) It's that Martino kid, the impressionist. 
CUT TO:

93   INT:   BERT THOMAS' OFFICE - DAY 
An irked BERT THOMAS wearily picks up the phone. 
THOMAS Yeah? ... Okay, Martino, let's stop the bullshit ... what? ... Okay, I'm listening. 
WE WATCH THOMAS' expression as it turns from skepticism to concern bordering on alarm. 
THOMAS Give me that again? ... Wait a minute. What do we call our second cameraman? 
CUT TO: 
94   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - DAY

95   INT:   BERT THOMAS' OFFICE - DAY 
THOMAS is still at the phone. 
THOMAS Don't do anything, Jerry.     Stay right there. Tell him we'll do     anything he wants. Tell him to cool     it. Are you okay? ... Look, tell him    to call us about five, okay. We'll     let him know what to do. And don't do     anything stupid. 
THOMAS puts down the phone. 
THOMAS (calls to his SECRETARY) Vivien! 
THOMAS' SECRETARY appears at the doorway. 
THOMAS Get me the number of the F.B.I. right away. And get me Crockett's office. And keep your mouth shut about this. 
CUT TO: 
96   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - DAY 
LANGFORD is standing awkwardly in the middle of the room, wearing a sweater that matches the patch of cloth we saw in the envelope MARSHA gave PUPKIN. PUPKIN is still training his pistol on LANGFORD and MARSHA is appraising the fit. 
MARSHA (to PUPKIN) What do you think? 
PUPKIN Looks fine. 
MARSHA (to LANGFORD) I had to guess on the sleeves. (to PUPKIN) He gets to keep it, doesn't he? 
PUPKIN Sure, if he isn't dead. 
CUT TO: 
THOMAS (upset) Does this mean we're not supposed to put him on?!? 
PATTEN Who am I addressing, please? 
CROCKETT That's Bert Thomas. He produces the show. 
PATTEN I'm only saying, Mr. Thomas, that we can't allow this to reach the public. When the kidnappers call in, of course you're going to be cooperative. Promise them anything they want. After all, this King character is going to have to show up sooner or later. And once we get our hands on him, he'll tell us where Mr. Langford is. 
PATTEN grinds his fist into his palm.

WE SEE PUPKIN in the shower, shampooing. 
CUT TO: 
101   INT:   THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE 
The scene is as before. 
PATTEN Sure. Let him go on if you have to. It's just a taping. You can always erase him afterwards, can't you? (pause) All I'm saying is this: don't put him on the air. 
THOMAS That's fine, Inspector, but let's say he finishes his bit and you've worked him over ... 
PATTEN Questioned him, Mr. Thomas. 
There is light laughter. 
THOMAS Okay, questioned him and he still won't talk. We get to eleven thirty and what do we do? Do we air him or what? 
There is a heavy pause. 
PATTEN I would say no. 
THOMAS But they might kill Jerry! 
CROCKETT (breaking in) Okay, Burt. (to PATTEN) Thank you, Inspector. We appreciate your position and we'll do all we can to cooperate with you.   But I have to tell you right now that, if it comes down to it, we're not taking any chances with Mr. Langford's life. 
PATTEN I understand but ... 
CROCKETT (interrupting) If your men haven't been able to locate Mr. Langford by air time, we're going to have to put this King guy on, no matter what he's said. After all, Inspector, what's ten or fifteen minutes of talk show time against a man's life? 
CUT TO: 
102   INT:     MARSHA'S APARTMENT - DAY 
WE SEE PUPKIN in his new suit and ruffled shirt, impeccably groomed, standing next to the bed. He is talking to LANGFORD but we don't see anyone but PUPKIN. 
PUPKIN Open. (pause) Bite ... Good. 
He is wrapping LANGFORD's mouth shut but all we see is that he is doing something. 
PUPKIN Can you breathe? Both ways?         In and out? 
WE    PULL    BACK TO SEE LANGFORD    nodding. He is strapped to the    bed    with tape and encased    like a mummy, only his eyes and    nose    showing. PUPKIN has     wrapped him in tape from tip to    toe.     MARSHA emerges from    the kitchen stirring something. 
PUPKIN (to MARSHA) You've got until around midnight. Have a good time. (to LANGFORD) So long, Jerry! Wish me luck. 
PUPKIN leaves.

THOMAS sits by his phone. There is           a large machine, looking like a large tape recorder,          attached to the phone and monitoring the call. GIARDELLO           is at a second phone and starts placing a call. PATTEN           stands next to THOMAS. There are two other PLAINCLOTHESMEN          in the room, CROCKETT and CATHY LONG. 
PATTEN (quietly to THOMAS) Keep him talking. 
THOMAS nods and picks up the phone. 
THOMAS Yes? ... Yes, Mr, King. We     understand. Everything's been arranged.     Now if you'll just tell me a little    about the nature of your material, so    that we can ...

117   EXT:   THE TELEVISION THEATER - DAY TO EARLY EVENING 
The situation appears normal. Only the regular backstage door GUARD, a big, grey-haired man, stands at the door. Nearby two other young MEN, in colorless suits, stand talking. We WATCH CLARENCE MCCABE, a writer, his plain WIFE and her PARENTS arrive in front of the theater, locate the backstage entrance and present themselves before the GUARD. 
MCCABE (a bit pompously) Good evening, officer. This is the backstage door I take it? 
GUARD Your name please? 
MCCABE Clarence McCabe, the writer. And this is Mrs. McCabe and her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Leroy Solters of Cleveland. 
GUARD (checking his list) I'm sorry, sir. I don't see you here. 
MCCABE I'm on the show tonight, officer. 
GUARD Well, you're not here. 
MCCABE (getting a bit agitated) Look, Cathy Long gave me instructions to present myself at a quarter to six. May I see her please? 
GUARD I'm under strictest orders tonight to admit only authorized personnel. 
MCCABE (huffy) This is absurd. (to the others) Wait right here. 
MCCABE marches past the GUARD and rushes to the backstage door. He opens it. The GUARD trails behind. 
GUARD Stop him!

CUT TO: 
MARSHA has finished a half bottle of wine. She is eating a beautifully decorated piece of stuffed capon and talking through her tears. 
MARSHA (crying) It was the second lead! I'd never gotten a part in my life and here I get the second lead. And what does Daddy say? 
SHOT of LANGFORD still bound from tip to toe. 
MARSHA Not "Marsha, that's wonderful" or "we're proud of you" or anything. Oh no. He starts lecturing me on how I should have tried out for Emily! Now do you understand, Jerry! 
MARSHA gets hold of herself. She swallows a couple of pills and swills them down with some wine. 
MARSHA (calmer) My doctor says I shouldn't get excited. 
MARSHA picks at another piece of capon. 
MARSHA This is the best I ever made it. You want some? 
LANGFORD, the mummy, nods. MARSHA picks up the plate across from her, fills it with food, and pulls a chair up next to LANGFORD. She undoes the tape around his mouth and picks a sock out of his mouth. 
MARSHA Now open.   Marsha's going to feed her Jerry.

127   INT:   BACKSTAGE - NIGHT 
Two young GIRLS are working on big cue cards copying from the piece of paper PUPKIN has given THOMAS. TONY RANDALL stands next to THOMAS. The two of them watch. RANDALL is going over the lines. 
CUT TO: 
128   INT:   THE BASEMENT ROOM - NIGHT 
PUPKIN has obviously been worked over.   He is sweating. 
PATTEN How about it, King? 
PUPKIN If I'm not on that show, Jerry Langford is dead, I promise you. 
PATTEN nods to his PLAINCLOTHESMEN again who start working PUPKIN over.

129   INT:   THE TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT 
The beginning of the taping is seconds away. Everyone is in his place. The STAGE MANAGER is counting down from five on his fingers. At zero, he points across to RICK ROSS, the orchestra leader, who strikes up the familiar Langford Show theme song. 
CUT TO: 
130   INT:   THE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT 
Four TECHNICAL ENGINEERS are seated along a large console containing a multitude of small television screens. One screen shows the spotlight falling where Randall will enter. Another shows the logo of the Langford Show. Another shows nothing in particular. Behind the TECHNICIANS, stand CROCKETT and the EXECUTIVES we have seen in the previous scenes. A TECHNICIAN is giving instructions to the CAMERAMAN. 
TECHNICIAN Hold on two. Hold. Hold.    Come on, Keller. Get it framed!

131   INT:   THE TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT 
The theme song is playing.   BERT CANTER stands off-camera 
at one side of the stage before a microphone. 
CANTER Now! Direct from New York! It's the Jerry Langford Show with guest host Tony Randall and his special guests -- Olympic swimmer Mark Spitz, pundit Gore Vidal, the one and only Zsa Zsa Gabor and another of Jerry's taped exclusives, an interview with Prince Ranier of Monaco. As always, Rick Ross and the Orchestra and me, Bert Canter. And now ... say hello to Tony!!!!!! 
CUT TO: 
An APPLAUSE sign flashes like crazy. The AUDIENCE cheers wildly. In the back, we notice a handful of TACTICAL PATROLMEN scattered about. RANDALL strides on stage briskly, accepting the cheers of the crowd with his arms raised. He nods and then his eyes fix on those hastily written outsized cue cards. He reads them with a mixture of professionalism and wry distance, wanting to disown the words without seeming silly. 
RANDALL Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you very much. I have some sad news for you. Earlier today, my writing staff was executed in Central Park by the network firing squad so there'll be no sensational Randall monologue this evening. 
The AUDIENCE cheers derisively. 
RANDALL No embarrassing displays of emotion, please. (the AUDIENCE laughs) Instead, we're going to do something a little bit different this evening -- a lot different if you ask me. We're going to give you a glimpse into the future. It isn't often that you can call someone a sure thing in the entertainment business. After all, the verdict is always in your hands. But I think tonight, after you've met my first guest, you'll agree with me that he's destined for greatness -- in one way or another. So will you please give your warmest greeting to the newest King of Comedy, Rupert Pupkin!!!! 
The music plays. The APPLAUSE sign flashes. The AUDIENCE applauds heartily -- and nobody appears to fill the spotlight at the edge of the wings. The spotlight holds 
for what seems like an eternity.

TECHNICIAN Just hold.   Three. Pick up the audience.

133   INT:   THE STAGE - NIGHT 
Finally after what seems like an eternity, PUPKIN emerges, straightening his jacket a bit and trying to crane the kinks out of his neck. He is a bit tense but very high and in full command. As he delivers his monologue, PUPKIN is more confident, comfortable and self-assured than we have ever seen him. 
PUPKIN Good evening, ladies and gentleman. Let me introduce myself. My name is Rupert Pupkin. I was born in Clifton, New Jersey, which was not, at that time, a federal offense. (laughter) Is there anyone here from Clifton? (silence) Good. We can all relax. Now, I'd like to begin by saying that my parents were too poor to afford me a childhood but the fact is nobody is allowed to be really poor in Clifton. Once you fall below eleven thousand you're exiled to Passaic. My parents did, in fact, put down the first two payments on my childhood. Then they tried to return me to the hospital as defective.   But, like everyone else I grew up in large part thanks to my mother. If she was only here today I'd say, "Hey, mom. What are you doing here? You've been dead for nine years?" (laughter) You should have seen my mother. She was wonderful -- blonde, beautiful, intelligent, alcoholic. (laughter) We used to drink milk together after school. Mine was homogenized. Hers was loaded. (laughter) Once she was picked up for speeding. They clocked her doing fifty -- in our garage. (laughter) When they tested her they found that her alcohol was two per cent blood. They took away her license and she died shortly afterwards. We used to joke together Mom and me, until the tears would stream down her face and she'd 
throw up. (laughter) And who would clean it up? Not Dad. He was too busy down at O'Grady's throwing up on his own. In fact, until I was sixteen, I thought throwing up was a sign of maturity. While the other kids were off in the woods sneaking cigarettes, I was hiding behind the house with my fingers down my throat. (laughter) I never got anywhere until one day, my father caught me. Just as he was giving me a final kick in the stomach, for luck, I managed to heave all over his new shoes. "That's it," I thought. "I've made it. I'm finally a man!" (laughter) As it turned out, that was the only time my father ever paid any real attention to me. He was usually too busy out in the park playing ball with my sister, Rose. And, today thanks to those many hours of practice, my sister Rose has grown into a fine man. (laughter) Me, I wasn't especially interested in athletics. The only exercise I ever got was when the other kids picked on me. They used to beat me up once a week, usually Tuesday. After a while, the school worked it into the curriculum. And, if you knocked me out, you got extra credit. (laughter) Except there was this one kid who was afraid of me. I kept telling him, "Hit me! Hit me! What's the matter with you? Don't you want graduate?" As for me, I was the only kid in the history of the school to graduate in traction. The school nurse tucked my diploma into my sling. But my only real interest, right from the beginning, was show business. Even as a young man, I began at the very top, collecting autographs. (laughter) 
CUT TO: 
PATTEN You're not going anywhere, Pupkin. Now, where is he? 
PUPKIN I'm telling you, Inspector,    if I don't see that show where I    want to see it, Jerry Langford is dead. My     people have instructions to execute    him unless they hear from me by    midnight. 
PATTEN glances apprehensively at GIARDELLO. 
PATTEN Just where is it you want to watch this show? 
CUT TO: 
141   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
LANGFORD is half unwrapped now. The place is covered with yard after yard of tape.   MARSHA is working frantically to finish unwrapping LANGFORD who is helping now that his arms are free. 
LANGFORD Ow!   God damnit! Not so fast! 
MARSHA (working frantically) We haven't all night, baby. 
MARSHA rips the tape off LANGFORD. 
LANGFORD OW!!!! 
MARSHA Oh, I love you, baby.   I love you so much. 
CUT TO: 
142   EXT:   BROADWAY - NIGHT 
A limo drives down Broadway, followed by an unmarked car. 
CUT TO: 
143   INT:   THE LIMO - NIGHT 
PATTEN and GIARDELLO sit up front, with the DRIVER. PUPKIN sits in the back between two PLAINCLOTHESMEN. The limo pulls up in front of the bar-restaurant where RITA works. PATTEN turns around in the front seat to address PUPKIN. 
PATTEN Here we, are, Pupkin. I don't know what this is all about, but as soon as you've seen yourself, you're going to talk to us or I promise you, you'll never see daylight again. 
PUPKIN I'll need a couple of minutes, Inspector. 
PATTEN 
What?!? 
PUPKIN After it's over, I want a couple of minutes. And I'll need ten dollars. Does anyone of you gentlemen have my wallet? 
PATTEN Don't push me, Pupkin. 
PUPKIN A condemned man's last request, Inspector. 
PATTEN Well, I'll tell you right away, the answer is no, Pupkin. 
PUPKIN It's not much of a ransom, Inspector ... 
PATTEN (losing his temper) Look, I'm drawing the line, that's all! No ten dollars and that's it. (emphatically) No -- ten -- dollars!!!! You understand?!? 
PUPKIN (in mollifying tones) Sure. Sure, Inspector. No ten dollars ... 
PATTEN (appeased) Okay. 
PUPKIN ... and no Jerry Langford. 
There is a pause as PATTEN stifles himself. 
PUPKIN Come on, it's getting late, Inspector. 
PATTEN (exploding to     one of his MEN) Go ahead. Give him      his goddamned ten dollars! Give him      twenty! I don't care. Just get him      out of here! 
One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN in the back opens the door and PUPKIN and the other PLAINCLOTHESMAN get out. The unmarked car has pulled up behind the limo and other PLAINCLOTHESMEN stand next to it. PUPKIN and the two PLAINCLOTHESMEN start walking the ten yards or so to the bar-restaurant. 
CUT TO: 
144   INT:   THE BAR-RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
PUPKIN marches in flanked by the PLAINCLOTHESMEN. The clock over the bar reads 11:30. RITA looks up from talking with a CUSTOMER and sees PUPKIN. She says nothing. She just looks at him. There are five CUSTOMERS at the bar. A working class COUPLE in their late fifties are half-stewed, the man telling the woman that her friend, Maud, isn't really her friend because she wants $150 for a used refrigerator. A few seats down, two MEN in their mid- forties, in wind-breakers are locked in an intense but inaudible conversation. And, close to the television set which hangs over the far end of the bar sits a MOUSY MAN with glasses, who looks like an accountant. He is sipping a beer, his eyes fixed on the set where the CBS late movie is just showing its logo. PUPKIN marches up to the bar. 
PUPKIN (urgently to RITA) Turn on Langford. Seven. 
MOUSY MAN Hey!   I'm watching this. 
RITA keeps staring at PUPKIN. 
PUPKIN Just turn it. Come on. 
MOUSY MAN I was here first, mister. You can't just walk in like this. It isn't fair. 
RITA glances at the MAN. PUPKIN can't      wait. He vaults onto the bar and turns the set to the     Langford Show, just as, on screen, he walks from the wings     onto the stage to the applause of the studio audience.      Perched atop the bar, standing next to the image of himself,     PUPKIN looks down at RITA, a smile of pride and triumph on     his face. 
CUT TO: 
145   MONTAGE -- NIGHT 
PUPKIN walking onto television screens in various homes across America -- in a chic New York living room, in a suburban bedroom, in the parlor of an Indiana farmhouse, in a kitchen where a COUPLE is in the middle of a raging domestic quarrel, in an otherwise dark bedroom where a COUPLE is in the throes of lovemaking, in a bar, a station house, in a television store window display.

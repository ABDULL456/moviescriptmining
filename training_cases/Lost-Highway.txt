INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY 
in the blackness, a man, FRED, is sitting on a bed smoking a cigarette. we see his back, but with each glow of the cigarette ash, we see his face reflected in a mirror on the wall across from him.  In the darkness, there starts the sound of a motor which draws curtains back across a large picture window just off screen.  As the curtain moves, hard-edged light begins crawling across the room, and we see everything clearly.  Fred is wearing a robe and pajamas, it's early morning. 
CLOSE UP ON FRED'S FACE IN THE MIRROR - Blank expression - face somewhat obscured or distorted by smoke from the cigarette. 
CLOSE UP 0N FRED'S ACTUAL FACE - Unshaven, haggard look, eyes seem empty, glazed over.  Fred is 32 years old, with dark hair. 
THE DOORBELL RINGS.  Fred looks up, startled by the noise. He looks at the digital clock: 5:30 a.m. 
FRED STANDS, goes to an INTERCOM on the wall next to the mirror.  He pushes a button. 
A VOICE comes over the intercom. 
VOICE OVER INTERCOM Dick Laurent is dead. 
Fred leaves the bedroom and goes through the house.  He is on the upstairs level.  He looks through a narrow slot window, but can't see the front door below.  He goes further in the house to a picture window that overlooks the street below. There is NOBODY there.

INT.  THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Fred is dressed to go out: Black sport coat and slacks, buttoned up white shirt.  He picks up a music case.  A woman comes into the room.  This is Fred's wife, RENEE, 30 years old, dark hair, dressed smartly, a drink in her hand. 
RENEE You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight? 
FRED What are you going to do? 
RENEE I thought I'd stay home and read. 
Fred looks her over, she's sexy without trying. 
FRED Read?... Read what, Renee? 
Renee sits down on a couch and sips her drink.  Fred comes over to her, kisses her on the neck, which makes her laugh. 
FRED It's nice to know I can still make you laugh. 
RENEE I like to laugh, Fred. 
FRED That's why I married you. 
RENEE Wake me up when you get home. 
Fred brushes her cheek with his fingers, allowing them to linger for a moment on her face.

EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT 
A blue neon sign reads: LUNA LOUNGE.

INT.  LUNA LOUNGE - NIGHT 
Fred is on the bandstand.  He takes a solo on his saxophone. Fred plays hot, hard, neo-bop.  The BAND wails madly behind him.  The PATRONS explode onto the dance floor, making it a wild scene.  Fred Is a lion now, roaring away on his tenor, driving everyone nuts. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  LUNA LOUNGE - LATER 
RENEE (she looks up) Huh?... oh, yeah, it is. 
FRED Same one you were reading the other night? 
RENEE What night? 
FRED When you didn't come to the club. 
RENEE Oh. Oh, yeah.  No. This is a different one. 
FRED I called, you know. 
RENEE Called?  When? 
FRED From the club.  You didn't answer. 
RENEE I must have fallen asleep.  I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I? 
FRED You were asleep when I got home, yes. 
Renee goes back to her book.  Fred sips his coffee and smokes. 
RENEE (without looking up) I told you you could wake me up if you wanted to. 
Renee looks up at him now, takes off her glasses, and stares at him. 
CLOSE UP OF FRED'S FACE - a disturbed expression. 
Renee seems about to say something more, but stops, puts her glasses back on and resumes reading.

FADE IN: 
INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Fred is in bed waiting for Renee.  He hears noises from the bathroom - bottles clinking, drawers opening and closing. Renee comes out wearing a robe, which she sheds just before getting into bed.  Naked under the covers, she switches out her bedside lamp.  The only light in the room comes from the outside, through the windows.  Fred moves closer to Renee, puts his lips to her cheek, a hand on her breast.  She does not respond.  Fred pulls Renee to him, and kisses her passionately.  Renee accedes to his demands, but does not participate willingly.  He makes love to her voraciously, but her lack of passion disturbs him.  Fred can't stop, however, and when he comes she acts consolingly, stroking him maternally while he calms down.  He climbs off of her and retreats to his side of the bed. 
CLOSE UP ON FRED'S EYES - which express his horror and humiliation. 
They lie there in the dark silence for a while. 
Fred turns back toward Renee in the darkness. 
FRED I had a dream about you last night... 
RENEE Yeah? 
FRED You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.

FRED'S DREAM 
Fred is walking slowly across the living room. 
Fred's POV: moving - searching. 
Fred stops and listens. 
RENEE (tentatively - distant and off screen) Fred?  Fred, where are you? 
The camera turns slowly back toward the hallway, and as it drifts it RISES UP following along the hall and turning slowly into the bedroom.  Renee is lying below in the bed. 
FRED V.0. Then there you were... lying in bed... but it wasn't you... It looked like you... but it wasn't. 
The camera suddenly dives violently at Renee - into a TIGHT CLOSE UP.  Her face registers TOTAL FEAR. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Fred is lying in bed with Renee, who is now backlit by her bedside lamp.  Fred looks at her shadowed face, but it's not Renee's face.  It's a face Fred has never seen before.  Fred quickly turns and switches on his bedside lamp, and looks quickly back at Renee, whose face is now her own. 
RENEE Fred, are you all right? 
Fred reaches out a hand and tenderly touches her face.  Renee covers his hand with her own, and closes her eyes.

The Detectives enter the bedroom.  Fred and Renee follow. 
ED This is the bedroom. 
The Detectives look around without touching anything. 
AL Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you? 
FRED This is our bedroom. 
ED There's no other bedroom? 
FRED No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed. 
AL You're a musician? 
FRED Yes, I thought my wife ... 
ED What's your axe? 
FRED Tenor... Tenor saxophone.  Do you... 
ED (shakes his head) Tone deaf. 
AL (to Renee) Do you own a video camera? 
RENEE No. Fred hates them. 
The Detectives both look at Fred. 
FRED I like to remember things my own way. 
AL What do you mean by that? 
FRED How I remember them.  Not necessarily the way they happened. 
ED Do you have an alarm system? 
RENEE Yes, actually we do... but we haven't been using it. 
AL Why not? 
FRED It kept going off for some reason.  False alarms. 
ED Might be a good time to try using it again. 
AL Anybody else have a key to the house. 
RENEE No. 
AL Maid?  Relative? 
RENEE No, one of us is always here to let the maid in.  Nobody else has a key. 
ED (to Al) Let's check the doors and windows... See if there's been a break-in.

AL 
We'll keep a watch on the house. 
ED As best we can. 
AL If anything else happens, you'll call us. Al hands Fred a card.  Ed hands Renee a card. 
RENEE We will. 
FRED Thanks, guys. 
ED It's what we do. 
Ed and Al get into the car and drive off.  Renee and Fred look at each other, warily, then go back into the house.  THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OVER THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AS IN THE VIDEOTAPE. 
FRED No, not to me. 
Al, Ed and Fred all look at Renee. 
RENEE I...	no. No. No threats. 
ED We'll take the tapes with us, if that's all right with you? 
Ed looks at Fred, then Renee, both of whom nod their agreement. 
AL We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled. 
RENEE I don't know if I want to stay here.  I don't feel safe. 
FRED Where would you feel safe? 
RENEE I don't know. maybe a hotel. 
Ed and Al are watching this exchange between Fred and Renee with keen interest. 
There is a strained silence between them. 
ED Did you use the alarm system since we were here last? 
FRED The first night ... Not the last two. 
AL Why not? 
FRED (shrugs) I forgot.  Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid. 
RENEE Acting paranoid?!!! Someone is in our house while we're sleeping, filming us, and you don't want to act paranoid?!!! I thought you set the alarm! 
Fred gets up, lights a cigarette, paces. 
FRED I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on. 
RENEE But that doesn't solve the problem.  Who is doing this?  And why? 
Ed and Al rise from their chairs.  Ed picks up the envelopes. 
AL We'll find out, Mrs. Madison. 
Renee stands with the Detectives.  Fred stands apart - his expression, pained and bewildered. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
A swinging party is in progress at Andy's house - the man whose face we saw at the Luna Lounge with Renee.  ANDY, 37 years old, a slick guy, is seen moving through the crowd, making small talk, kissing and being kissed.  The PEOPLE here are wannabe players, the men mostly shady, gold-chain- wearing, slightly unsavory types; the women dressed provocatively, big hair and skin-tight dresses.  Through sliding glass doors we see nude and semi-nude people cavorting in a swimming pool.  Everyone has a drink in his or her hand.  Renee finishes her drinkt and hands the empty glass to Fred who walks away with it.  Andy grabs Renee, and dances with her.  They laugh and talk.  Renee appears to be a bit intoxicated. 
Fred, who appears less than thrilled with the carryings on, makes his way to the open bar where he orders two drinks. When the drinks arrive he drains one of them completely, then sets the empty glass down on the bar.  Then he swallows the other drink, too, and sets down the glass. 
A MYSTERY MAN, tall, well-dressed and groomed, older than Fred, approaches him. 
MYSTERY MAN We've met before, haven't we? 
FRED I don't think so.  Where was it that you think we've met? 
MYSTERY MAN At your house.  Don't you remember? 
FRED (surprised) No, no I don't.  Are you sure? 
MYSTERY MAN Of course.  In fact, I'm there right now. 
FRED (incredulous) What do you mean?  You're where right now? 
MYSTERY MAN At your house. 
FRED That's absurd. 
The Mystery Man reaches into his coat pocket, takes out a cellular phone and holds it out to Fred. 
MYSTERY MAN Call me. 
Fred snickers, like this is a bad joke.  The Mystery Man puts the phone into Fred's hand. 
MYSTERY MAN (CON-T) Dial your number. 
Fred hesitates, puzzled. 
MYSTERY MAN (CON-T) Go ahead. 
Fred shrugs, laughs, dials his number. We HEAR a pick up as we stay on FRED'S FACE. 
PHONE VOICE OF MYSTERY MAN I told you I was here. 
Fred, still holding the phone, stares at the man standing in front of him. 
FRED How did you do that? 
The Mystery Man points to the phone. 
We see Fred's eyes roll open as he cranes his neck around and upwards, looking at the video camera high on the wall of the courtroom, pointing down on him.

INT. LINGERIE SHOP - DAY 
MARIAN and RAQUEL, two exquisite young women, are looking over the merchandise. 
RAQUEL Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces? 
MARIAN How could I miss it?  The TV won't quit with that stuff. 
RAQUEL They're gonna cook him. 
MARIAN Andy's from Utah.  He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad. 
RAQUEL Which would you choose? 
Marian holds up a black teddy to her body. 
MARIAN Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely. 
RAQUEL Do they aim for the head or for the heart? 
MARIAN The heart, I guess. 
RAQUEL I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on.  Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity.  Savage pain, Marian. 
Raquel takes a red teddy and holds it up to her chest. 
MARIAN Oh, that's hot... So you'd rather be hung, huh? 
They both giggle at the obvious joke. 
RAQUEL Absolutely... Soon as your neck snaps, you black out.  It might take a while for the body to die, but you wouldn't feel it. 
Marian reaches for a pair of panties with a hole in the crotch. 
MARIAN You might be right, Raquel. 
Marian sticks a finger through the hole in the panties and wiggles it.  The girls giggle.  Raquel sees Andy walking into the store.  He is sneaking up behind Marian, and motions with a finger to his lips to Raquel not to say anything.  When Andy gets directly behind Marian, he puts his hands over her eyes. 
ANDY Guess who?

INT. PRISON - DEATH ROW - DAY 
Fred, in the custody of GUARDS, wearing handcuffs and leg irons, is being escorted to his cell.  He appears zombie-like as the guards open the cell door, unlock and remove his shackles, and lock him in. 
GUARD Make yourself to home, fella. 
The guards leave.  Fred stands near the cell door, begins to look around at the four walls, the single cot, the wash basin, and the toilet bowl without a seat.  He hears the muffled, DISTORTED NOISES - VOICES from the surrounding cells.  Lost voices - the voices of death row.  Fred realizes where he is now.  He walks over to the cot and slowly sinks down and sits on the edge.  Fred perched on the cot in his cell resembles a man adrift on a tiny raft in the middle of an ocean.

This is a small narrow yard, not the large exercise yard for population.  This yard is for use by death row prisoners only, to exercise in one hour each day, by himself.  Fred is released into the area, which is more like a dog run.  The Guards watch Fred as he walks slowly up and down the exercise yard. 
CUT TO: 
GUARD Something wrong? 
FRED My... My head. 
GUARD Headache, huh?  Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it. 
FRED No, no.  I want to go in. 
The guard assists Fred back inside the building. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL - DAY 
Fred is on his cot, holding his head.  He is obviously in pain.  He gets up and staggers to the cell door.  Fred pushes a CALL button next to the door to summon a guard.  The GUARD comes and speaks to Fred through a double mesh opening. 
GUARD What's botbering you, Madison? 
FRED The pain is getting worse.  I need more aspirin. 
GUARD I can't give you anymore.  I'll talk to the doctor. 
The guard leaves. Fred collapses to the floor of the cell, writhing in pain. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRISON - INFIRMARY   DAY 
Fred is brought in wearing handcuffs and leg irons, a GUARD on either arm.  He is placed on a chair in the middle of the room.  The guards stand one on each side of him.  A DOCTOR enters.  He is in late-middle age, with serious eyebrows. Fred's head is hanging down, chin on chest.  The Doctor lifts Fred's head and we see dark circles under Fred's eyes; his face is pale, teeth clenched, eyes tearing.  The Doctor takes a light utensil from his pocket, and inspects each of Fred's eyes.  He feels Fred's forehead.  After this, he allows Fred's head to drop down again.  The Doctor takes Fred's pulse.  He drops Fred's wrist.  He next takes Fred's blood pressure. 
DOCTOR You sleeping okay? 
FRED (strained whisper) I can't sleep. 
The Doctor goes over to a cabinet, unlocks a drawer, and removes a large blue pill.  He fills a paper cup with water from a dispenser, goes back to Fred and places the pill in Fred's mouth.  The Doctor tilts Fred's head up and pours the water down his throat, some of it dribbling down the front of Fred's shirt.  The Doctor looks into Fred's mouth to make sure he swallowed the pill. 
DOCTOR You'll sleep now. (to Guards) Take him back to his cell. 
The guards lift Fred by his arms, and shuffle march him out of the infirmary. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL - NIGHT 
Fred awakens on his cot.  He turns and sits up in the darkness.  A stream of light through the slot window illumines Fred's head, the forehead of which is swollen and discolored.  He staggers up and shuffles over to the call button, which he leans on.  A few moments later, a GUARD appears on the other side of the mesh. 
GUARD What is it? 
FRED Aspirin... fly head.  I gotta have more aspirin. 
GUARD The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning. 
FRED But my head... 
The guard looks at Fred through the window, and what he sees disturbs him.  The guard makes a strange face. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRISON - DEATH ROW HALLWAY - NIGHT 
The guard walks away from Fred's door to the guard station, where another GUARD is sitting at a table, reading a magazine. 
GUARD #1 Shit, that wife killer's lookin' pretty fucked up. 
GUARD #2 (not looking up from his magazine) Which one? 
They both laugh. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRIS0N - FRED'S CELL - SAME - NIGHT 
Fred is on the floor lying on back. The camera comes slowly down at him from the ceiling, like a weight pressing on his head.  Fred's pain is demonstrably overwhelming him now.  He moans and rolls from side to side in the dimness, making grotesque, otherworldly sounds.  As the camera moves into a CLOSE UP, the last image of Fred's head shows the discolored swelling has increased.  Fred looks up, sensing something.

INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Marian and Raquel are in the living room, attired in the undergarments they purchased at the lingerie store.  HOT MUSIC is BLARING from a stereo.  Marian and Raquel are dancing, as sexy and wild as it is possible for them to be. Andy is lying on his back on the rug, dressed only in undershorts and socks, the girls stomping feet stepping furiously around his head and body.  His eyes are closed at first, but when he opens them, he sees their feet in a blur. He tries to get up, but he is too strung out, and he collapses again.  Marian and Raquel take him by his hands and feet and begin pulling him around the room as they dance. Andy is blitzed, smiling moronically.  The girls' breasts tumble out of their teddies.  Raquel drops her end of Andy, turns up the music even louder, and dances into a frenzy. Marian drops to her knees, Andy's feet on either side of her, shaking her shoulders and whipping her hair around.  Andy makes another attempt to sit up - he looks at Marian, reaches for her but falls back, dead to the world.  Raquel and Marian don't quit.

INT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL - NIGHT 
Fred is still curled on the floor, but spasms begin to rock his body.  He goes into convulsions, blood gushes from his nostrils.  His head is badly swollen.  Fred vomits repeatedly, and drags around in his mess.  Fred turns, straining upwards as we've seen him do before.  His face and head are hideously deformed. 
The Warden stands up and comes around the desk. 
WARDEN I want to take a look at this man myself. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRISON - INFIRMARY - DAY 
The man from Fred's cell is just finishing being fingerprinted. 
The doctor with serious eyebrows - DR. ROGOFF - is inspecting the man's face.  The Warden enters with Captain Henderson. GUARDS are standing by the door and at strategic spots in the room. 
WARDEN What is this, Rogoff? 
DR. ROGOFF I don't know yet. 
Dr. Rogoff begins to draw blood from the man's arm. He takes several vials.  The man watches the blood coming out of his arm, but doesn't seem to understand where he is or what is happening to him. 
WARDEN Who is this man? 
DR. ROGOFF He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away.  We'll find out soon enough. 
Dr. Rogoff opens the man's mouth and peers in with a pencil light. 
WARDEN He's not Madison? 
DR. ROGOFF (slowly, deliberately Not even close. 
Dr. Rogoff stands up, puts the light in his breast pocket. 
DR. ROGOFF (CON'T) I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache. 
WARDEN A headache? 
DR. ROGOFF I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill.  I've never seen this man before.  Neither have the guards.  I don't think he's in the system. 
The Warden moves closer to the man - he looks closely at him. 
WARDEN Where the hell did you come from, mister? 
CLOSE UP OF THE MAN - he's staring straight up.

INT. PRISON - WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Present are the Warden, Captain Henderson and TWO other PRISON OFFICIALS.  The Warden is looking at a computer next to his desk. 
WARDEN Well, gentlemen, we know who the stranger is. His name is Peter Raymond Dayton. He's twenty-four years old.  His birthday is April 21st.  He was born and raised right here.  He lives with his parents, William and Claire Dayton at 814 Garland Avenue.  Pete Dayton was arrested five (MORE) 
WARDEN (cont'd) years ago for auto theft, for which he was put on probation for one year.  That was his first and only offense.  No record since then. 
Warden Clements looks up, takes a deep breath and stares at the men in front of him. 
WARDEN (CON-T) How about Madison?  Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts? 
CAPTAIN HENDERSON Nothing, Marsh.  Vanished.  There's an APB out on him.  His photo's been faxed nationwide. 
PRISON OFFICIAL #1 I had a call from the governor's office about this. 
WARDEN How the hell does she know? 
PRISON OFFICIAL #1 There's press outside right now. 
WARDEN How the hell... 7 
CAPTAIN HENDERSON One of the guards must have leaked it. 
WARDEN What's the word on the street? 
PRISON OFFICIAL #2 Only that Madison has apparently escaped. Nothing about the other guy. 
WARDEN Good, let's keep it that way.  Keep a lid on Dayton.  Nothing gets out about him.

Pete is stretched out on his bed watching television.  He hears the front door bell ring - footsteps, and a moment or two later the door to his bedroom opens and three of his friends, CARL, LANIE and STEVE ("V") saunter in. 
"V" Where the fuck have you been? 
Pete pulls himself up to a sitting position. 
PETE Hey. 
CARL You look like shit. 
LANIE What happened? 
PETE Just haven't been feelin' well. 
"V" You're not contagious are you? 
PETE I don't think so. 
"V" Good... You up for a drive? 
PETE Where to?  Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too. 
LANIE They found a cyst on my god damn ovary. Had to cut it out.  You wanna see the scar? 
Lanie pulls up her shirt and pulls down her pants a ways revealing a fresh scar about three inches long. 
CARL (winking) Hadn't slowed her down none. 
LANIE (smacking him) Shut up, bone-head. 
Then Lanie laughs good-naturedly. 
"V" Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin". 
PETE Sheila'll be at "Tops". 
"V" Sure, what's wrong with that? 
PETE Okay. 
Pete hauls himself up off the bed and throws on a black leather jacket. 
The four of them go through the living room where Bill and Claire are drinking and watching TV. 
PETE (to Bill and Claire) Goin' out with these clowns for a while. 
BILL Do ya good. 
After Pete leaves with his friends, Bill and Claire look at each other.

"V" drives a black, beat-up '66 Grand Prix.  Carl and Lanie are in the back seat, and Pete rides shotgun.  The four of them., are cruising down Van Nuys Boulevard along with many other MUSCLE CARS and LOW-RIDERS filled with KIDS looking for action. "V's" car is making a hell of a noise. 
PETE I hate ridin' in this fuckin' car. 
CARL Take it easy, Pete, "V" loves this rod. 
"V" Look at that goin' my way. 
"V" has seen a couple. of GIRLS in short, tight dresses walking up the boulevard. 
"V" (CON'T) Oh my, oh my. 
LANIE Keep it in your pants, "V". 
Some big cars nearby rev their engines.  "V" guns his car and it lurches roughly forward.  The sound of the rough running engine reverberates in Pete's brain. 
PETE This rod is a fuckin, embarrassment, Carl.  Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"? 
"V" Texaco... What's wrong with that? 
PETE Listen. 
"V" You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think. 
Pete shakes his bead with disgust. 
Sheila leans in very close to Pete and whispers in his ear. 
SHEILA (CON'T) You still care about me? 
PETE Sure.  Sure I do. 
Sheila pushes her mouth on Pete's and they kiss., Pete breaks away - looks at Sheila - serious. 
PETE (CON'T) What else about that night?... Did anything happen? 
SHEILA You really don't remember? 
PETE No... I told you.

Pete's parents POV down the hall toward Pete's room.  There is no one there - just an empty hallway. 
Pete's parents continue to stare, but then turn away toward each other - they start to laugh quietly again.

He drives past "Tops", but doesn't see anyone he knows. 
He turns off the boulevard and drives through San Fernando valley neighborhood streets. 
He pulls up in front of Sheila's house and honks his horn. 
He lights a cigarette while he waits. 
In a few minutes Sheila comes out and leans in the passenger side window. 
SHEILA What do you want?

Pete pulls over into a dark shadow under a tree and stops the car. 
He cuts the engine, turns to Sheila and kisses her.  She breaks away. 
SHEILA Why don't you like me? 
PETE I do like you, Sheila. 
Sheila puts her lips up' close to his and whispers. 
SHEILA How much?

ALICE (fear) Is that car following us? 
Pete glances in the rearview mirror - sees the headlights. 
At the last moment he pulls a hard right and accelerates down the street.  The car follows - they both see it. 
PETE I'll lose 'em at the light. 
Alice steals a look back. 
ALICE I don't recognize the car... 
At a tralfic light, Pete revs up the big Camaro and expertly peels out between on-coming cross traffic.  He swerves between two cars going in opposite directions - blasts up a block and hangs a hard right - disappearing from view. 
Ed and Al go out into the traffic after them, but the swerving, screeching cars braking around them form a barrier and trap them.  ANGRY DRIVERS lean on their horns.

PETE I gotta headache... What's goin' on? 
BILL The police called us. 
PETE Yeah? what did they want? 
BILL They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night.  They wanted to know if you remembered anything. 
PETE But I don't remember anything.  What did you tell 'em? 
CLAIRE (whispers) We saw you that night, Pete.

Bill and Claire just stare at Pete. 
PETE (CON'T) Please tell me. 
BILL No. 
ALICE I don't know. 
PETE We should stop seeing each other. 
ALICE No... no. 
Alice moves closer to Pete and melts into him.  She places his hand on her breast and looks in his eyes. 
ALICE (CON'T) I don't want to live without you. 
She kisses Pete and pulls up her sweater to let him feel her bare breasts.  Pete kisses her back - lost in his longing for her. 
Alice breaks away. 
ALICE (CON'T) We have to get away... We have to get some money. 
Pete just stares at her. 
ALICE (CON'T) I know a guy... He pays girls to party with him... He always has alotta cash... 
Alice puts her band up to Pete's cbeek and lets it drift around. 
ALICE (CON'T) He'd be easy to rob... Then we'd have the money... and we could get away ... We'd be together. 
Alice kisses Pete's lips over and over - looking in his eyes. 
PETE Have you partied with him?

PETE You like it? 
ALICE No, honey... It was part of the deal.

PETE In pornos? 
ALICE No... A job... I didn't know what.  He set up an appointment for me to see a man. 
CUT TO: 
ALICE'S STORY 
We see Alice wearing a sexy tight dress in a plain room. It feels like we are inside of a large building - maybe an office building. 
Alice is waiting nervously. 
A SLICKSTER in shiny shirt and pants is leaning against a closed door. 
There is another door off the room which is open onto a room where a MUSCLE MAN in tiny briefs is doing bench presses. 
No one is saying anything. 
ALICE (voiceover) I went to this place... They made me wait forever.  There was some guy guardin' the door... I started gettin' nervous... In another room I could see some guy liftin' (MORE) 
ALICE (cont'd) weights... Both these guys gave me the creeps... They never said anything to me... So I just smoked cigarettes and waited. 
We move in on a nervous EXHALE OF SMOKE to a CLOSE UP of Alice waiting. 
We see a CLOSE UP of the man guarding the door. 
We see a CLOSE SHOT of the man bench pressing a lot of weight. 
Suddenly, there are two knocks on the other side of the closed door.  The Slickster moves off the door and opens it a crack.  He talks quietly to someone Alice can't see, then he turns, opens the door and gestures for Alice to go through. 
Alice puts out her cigarette - her hand is shaking. 
She walks over past the Slickster and enters a much larger room.  There are about FIFTEEN MEN in the room - all leaning comfortably at different points on the walls.  There is only one chair in the room - Mr. Eddy is sitting in it. 
No one says anything to her, but one man nods his head and from this nod, Alice feels she should walk to the center of the room.  She does, and she instinctively turns to the man sitting in the chair. 
They start to go at it again - at first slowly and tenderly - then wildly.  Alice tears herself away and looks up at Pete. 
ALICE (CON'T) Are you my man? 
PETE (getting hotter) Yes. 
ALICE Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete? 
Pete looks at her - starting to understand what she means. 
ALICE (CON'T) Are you? 
Pete stares at her - then nods. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DAYTON HOUSE - NIGHT 
Pete drives up and parks his Camaro in the driveway.  When he gets out of the car, he sees Sheila standing by the front step.  She is looking in his direction, but doesn't seem to see him.  She SUDDENLY turns and looks up the street - she YELLS. 
SHEILA (total horror) THERE'S SOMEONE WITH HIM!! 
As she yells, she starts to look around wildly - then her eyes follow the path the Camaro took into the driveway - then the path Pete took to where he has been standing all this time.  Her eyes find Pete and she stands by the front step. 
PETE (frightened) Sheila? 
She heads toward him. 
PETE Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here? 
SHEILA You've been fucking somebody else haven't you? 
PETE Sheila... 
SHEILA You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is. 
Sheila has come up and is grabbing Pete by the front of his shirt. 
PETE Hey... Sheila. 
SHEILA What's the BITCH'S name?! 
PETE Look Sheila... I'm sorry... 
SHEILA YOU'RE SORRY!! 
PETE Go home, Sheila. 
Sheila starts beating him in the face and chest. 
SHEILA YOU'RE SORRY!! YOU PIECE OF SHIT!! YOU'RE SORRY!! 
She starts crying and hitting him harder. 
SHEILA (CON'T) FUCK YOU!! 
Sheila's screaming is reverberating around the neighborhood. INSIDE PETE'S MIND the SOUNDS are even LOUDER. 
Bill comes out of the house.  Claire is behind him waiting on the front porch. 
Sheila beats Pete and trips him to the ground.  She is sobbing as she tears at him. 
PETE Sheila... Stop... 
SHEILA FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!! 
Bill comes up to Sheila and takes her gently by the shoulders. 
Sheila jerks around and looks up at Bill. 
BILL Why don't you two come inside and talk things over quietly... Come on... Come on in, Sheila. 
Sheila gets to her feet - crying.  She looks down at Pete, who remains lying on the front lawn. 
For Pete, every word and every sound is LOUD and DISTORTED. The DRONING SOUND returns. 
SHEILA (to Pete) You are different. 
BILL Sheila... 
SHEILA (to Bill) TELL HIM! 
The phone inside the house starts to ring.  Claire turns in the doorway and goes to answer it. 
BILL Sheila... Don't. 
SHEILA I don't care anyway... I'm sorry, Mr. Dayton... I won't bother you or any member of your family again. 
Sheila runs off crying.  Pete and Bill watch her go. 
Claire comes to the door.

The bus stops and Pete gets out.  He starts walking. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DEEP DELL PLACE - NIGHT 
We see a street sign saying "Deep Dell Place".  Pete walks up the street looking at numbers. 
He finds 2224 Deep Dell Place - Andy's House. 
He stares at the house from the sidewalk. 
Lights are on upstairs and down.  The hot wind moves big shadows of trees over the front of the house. 
Pete looks at his watch.  It reads: 11:05 p.m. 
He walks down the driveway, crosses through some bushes and comes to a fence separating the front yard from the back. 
He stops and listens.  He pulls himself up and over the fence, but crashes on something on the other side. 
He freezes - listening. He hears the wind blowing through the trees, and distant music from inside - a slow jazz piece. He hears echoing sounds of love making. 
He makes his way around back - goes up the stairs and tries the back door.  It opens. 
CUT TO: INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Pete sneaks through the kitchen and comes into the living room.  Pete stops short and stares.  A movie projector is running in the living room.  A porno film is being projected on a huge screen at the far end.  Alice is in the porno film. A man is fucking her from behind - with LOUD SLAPPING SOUNDS of flesh banging flesh.  Her face is in the foreground.  Her eyes look out directly at Pete.  She is loving every minute of it.  Inside Pete, jealousy starts to rage out of control. He looks around.  He sees clothes scattered about.  He picks up a girl's sweater and smells it.  He looks up the stairs. 
Feet appear at the top of the stairs.  They start down. 
Pete runs for the bar. 
Along the way, he grabs a heavy, bronze figurine of a well- stacked woman off a rectangular glass-topped coffee table, and ducks behind the bar. 
He can hear Andy approaching.  He can hear Andy gather two glasses.  He can hear Alice being fucked harder in the porno film.  He clenches his teeth with rage. 
Suddenly, Andy moves right in front of him.  They see each other.  Andy's eyes widen - Pete leaps up, and thwacks the bronze figurine down on the top of Andy's head.  Andy falls. The breasts of the figurine have made two bloody holes in his forehead. 
Pete turns. 
Alice is coming quickly down the stairway - naked, except for a pair of panties.  Lipstick is smeared around her mouth. She is carrying a half-filled pillowcase.  Her porno film is playing on the wall behind her. 
These images jump and spin in Pete's mind.  He moves unsteadily toward her. 
ALICE You got him. 
PETE (still holding the figurine) Alice, I... 
Pete starts to tremble.  He drops the figurine.  He tries to embrace her. 
There is a crashing noise behind him. 
Pete turns and sees Andy staggering, blood streaming from the wound in his head, THEN CHARGING FULL SPEED AT PETE. 
Andy hits him hard, and Pete goes down.  When Pete hits the ground, he pushes Andy up and throws out his arms.  This, and Andy's momentum, catapult Andy into the corner of the rectangular glass-topped coffee table.  There is a sound like a hammer going through a bucket of eggs as the glass corner embeds about eight inches into Andy's forehead. 
CLOSE UP OF ANDY'S HEAD - impaled on the sharp corner of the table, his chest area suspended, his legs and stomach touching the floor. 
ALICE (amazement - no feeling) Wow! 
Pete pulls himself off the floor. 
Pete moves close to Alice, they drift to the glass coffee table, staring for a few moments at Andy's dead body. 
While Pete stares, unbelieving, at Andy - Alice hurriedly picks up her sweater and puts it on. On the sofa next to it lay Andy's trousers.  She goes through the pockets, finds a roll of cash bound by a rubber band.  Alice hands the roll to Pete. 
ALICE (CON'T) Put this in your pocket. 
Alice kneels next to Andy's body and quickly removes his Rolex wristwatch, a couple of rings and the gold chain dangling from his neck.  These items she puts inside the empty pillowcase. 
Alice finds the rest of her clothes scattered about the living room and puts them on.  Pete watches her, trembling, unable to say anything. 
She comes back to Pete, who starts breathing irregularly, hyperventilating. 
ALICE (CON'T) You all right? 
PETE, We killed him. 
ALICE You killed him. 
PETE Alice? 
Alice slides up close to Pete. 
ALICE It was an accident... Accidents happen every day. 
Pete clutches her, eyes squeezed tight, as if he is holding on for dear life. 
PETE Alice... 
Pete's POV: He watches Alice ring the doorbell.  She waits in front of the door for a few moments, her hair blowing in the wind. 
A HOUSEBOY opens the door.  Alice says something to him - Pete cannot bear anything that is said, even though his driver's side window is down.  All he can hear is the hot wind blowing. 
The Houseboy moves out to where he can see Pete, waiting in the car.  The Houseboy and Alice exchange information.  The Houseboy points out toward the desert.  Alice turns back to the car. The Houseboy watches her.

Pete starts the car and begins backing it out the drive.  The Houseboy is still standing - watching them.

Pete and Alice drive off.  The Houseboy continues to watch them.

Pete and Alice pull off the two-lane highway onto a barely discernible dirt road that cuts through the dark desert. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 
Pete and Alice drive up to a ONE ROOM CABIN built on stilts next to a dry lakebed.  They both get out and go up the stairs to a porch where Alice knocks on the door.  There is no answer. 
Alice opens the door, but there is NOBODY INSIDE. 
ALICE We'll have to wait. 
The hot wind continues to blow. 
Alice and Pete walk back down to the car. 
The HEADLIGHTS are on and Alice reaches in through the window and switches on the RADIO.  She can't get anything in but static, with bits and pieces of old tunes fading in and out. She hits the "seek" button.  The radio starts to search. 
Pete is standing in the glare of the headlights watching her. Alice walks slowly to him. 
The camera captures this from a back seat perspective - then drifts toward them. 
PETE Why me, Alice?  Why choose me? 
The radio sticks on a particular tune - a tune filled with longing. Alice begins to dance.  She takes Pete's hand and pulls him close to her. 
ALICE So we can be together... You still want to be with me, don't you Pete? 
Alice gives Pete that wild smile. 
ALICE (CON'T) More than ever? 
She kisses Pete over and over.  He begins to kiss her back. She starts to move him in a dance to the music in the glare of the headlights, the hot wind caressing them. 
The scene is out of a dream.  Alice and Pete help each other undress as they dance in and out of the light, and the wind whips at their bodies. 
They sink down on the soft ground and start making love. 
The lights from the headlights combine with the starlight, bathing them in a pristine glow. 
The music fades and the radio begins to "seek" through static for another station.  The music it finds now is LOUD and INTENSE. 
Alice - her hunger appearing, now becomes carnivorous in her approach to love making with Pete.  She is the aggressor, highly-charged - she wants more and more - taking, not giving, insatiable. 
The headlights flare their bodies in blinding light.  They become amorphous, glowing shapes burning in the light. 
Pete is trying desperately to please her - to have her. 
The driving music fills with cracks of piercing static.  The radio strains to hold the station. 
Pete's white-hot body clings to Alice.  He chokes with emotion. 
PETE I want you... I want you... 
With a burning smile, Alice rolls them out of the beams of light into the darkness.  The wind billows a black cloud of dust around them. 
Alice pulls away from Pete and brings her dark mouth to his ear. 
ALICE You'll never have me. 
Alice glides away from Pete and stands up looking down at him from above. 
Fred closes his eyes.

Renee is sitting half dressed on the edge of the bed, pulling on her stockings.  Mr. Eddy/Laurent is asleep next to her. Renee stands up, finishes dressing, then leans down and kisses her lover while he sleeps.  Renee leaves the room, closing the door as quietly as possible behind her. 
As the door CLICKS, Mr. Eddy/Laurent wakes up.  He sits up and gets a pack of cigarettes from the bedside table, shakes one out, lights it with a book of "Lost Highway Hotel" matches, and smokes it while seated on the edge of the bed.

Fred, still fully dressed, is waking up, AS IF IN A TRANCE - the same attitude he had on the videotape.  He strains upwards and looks eerily around the room.  He gets up and crosses slowly to a window.  He takes the edge of the window curtain and pulls it back. 
The view is of the gravel parking lot of the hotel. 
Fred's POV: He sees Renee, down below, walk over to a car, get in and drive away. 
Fred walks back to his bed, picks up his revolver from under the pillow, crosses the room to the door and walks out.

MR. EDDY/LAURENT Renee? 
He goes to the door and opens it a crack. 
As the door opens, Fred smashes the gun into Mr. Eddy/ Laurent's face and pushes his way inside the room. 
Fred hits Mr. Eddy/Laurent viciously again with the gun barrel. 
Mr. Eddy/Laurent is bleeding profusely from gashes on his forehead and nose. 
MR. EDDY/LAURENT What the fuck? What's going on? 
FRED (pointing the gun at him) You're coming with me. 
Fred puts the pistol up against Mr. Eddy/Laurent's head and marches him out of the room - past the camera's eye. 
The camera stays in the room and moves slowly toward the window, through which we see Fred and Mr. Eddy/Laurent appear down below in the back lot. 
Still watching out the window, the camera sees Fred knock Mr. Eddy/Laurent over the head with the gun butt and put him into the trunk of a car.  Fred slams the trunk lid and climbs into the driver's side of what is obviously Mr. Eddy/Laurent's car - the Mercedes 600 Pullman. 
As Fred drives away, a HAND appears in our window foreground. The hand moves the window curtain further to one side.  The camera pulls back to reveal it as the hand of the Mystery Man.  The Mystery Man leans fully into the frame and watches Fred drive off down the Lost Highway as day breaks.

INCEPTION 
Written by 
Christopher Nolan 
SHOOTING SCRIPT FADE IN: 
DAWN. CRASHING SURF. 
The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand. He lies there. 
A CHILD'S SHOUT makes him LIFT his head to see: a LITTLE BLONDE BOY crouching, back towards us, watching the tide eat a SANDCASTLE. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy. The Bearded Man tries to call them, but they RUN OFF, FACES UNSEEN. He COLLAPSES. 
The barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto his back. A JAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then calls up the beach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP. Behind them is a cliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE. 
INT. ELEGANT DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - LATER 
The Security Guard waits as an ATTENDANT speaks to an ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN sitting at the dining table, back to us. 
ATTENDANT (in Japanese) He was delirious. But he asked for you by name. And... (to the Security Guard) Show him. 
SECURITY GUARD (in Japanese) He was carrying nothing but this... 
He puts a HANDGUN on the table. The Elderly Man keeps eating. 
SECURITY GUARD ...and this. 
The Security Guard places a SMALL PEWTER CONE alongside the gun. The Elderly Man STOPS eating. Picks up the cone. 
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN (in Japanese) Bring him here. And some food. 
INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER 
The Elderly Man watches the Bearded Man WOLF down his food. He SLIDES the handgun down the table towards him. 
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN (in English) Are you here to kill me? 
The Bearded Man glances up at him, then back to his food. 
The Elderly Japanese Man picks up the cone between thumb and forefinger. 
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN I know what this is. 
He SPINS it onto a table- it CIRCLES gracefully across the polished ebony... a SPINNING TOP. 
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN I've seen one before. Many, many years ago... 
The Elderly Japanese Man STARES at the top mesmerized. 
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN It belonged to a man I met in a half-remembered dream... 
MOVE IN on the GRACEFULLY SPINNING TOP... 
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN A man possessed of some radical notions... 
The Elderly Japanese Man STARES, remembering... 
COBB (V.O.) What's the most resilient parasite? 
CUT TO: 
INT. SAME ELEGANT DINING ROOM - NIGHT (YEARS EARLIER) 
The speaker, COBB, is 35, handsome, tailored. A young Japanese man, SAITO, eats as he listens. 
COBB A bacteria? A virus? 
Cobb gestures at their feast with his wine glass- 
COBB An intestinal worm? 
Saito's fork pauses, mid-air. Cobb GRINS. A third man is at the table- ARTHUR. He jumps in to save the pitch- 
ARTHUR What Mr. Cobb is trying to say- 
COBB An idea. 
Saito looks at Cobb, curious. 
COBB Resilient, highly contagious. Once an idea's taken hold in the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate. A person can cover it up, ignore it- but it stays there. 
SAITO But surely-to forget...? 
COBB Information, yes. But an idea? Fully formed, understood? That sticks... (taps forehead) In there, somewhere. 
SAITO For someone like you to steal? 
ARTHUR Yes. In the dream state, conscious defenses are lowered and your thoughts become vulnerable to theft. It's called extraction. 
COBB But, Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself from even the most skilled extractor. 
SAITO How can you do that? 
COBB Because I am the most skilled extractor. I know how to search your mind and find your secrets. I know the tricks, and I can teach them to your subconscious so that even when you're asleep, your guard is never down. 
Cobb leans forwards. Holding Saito's gaze. 
COBB But if I'm going to help you, you have to be completely open to me. I'll need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife, your analyst, anyone. (gestures around) If this is a dream and you've got a safe full of secrets, I need to know what's in that safe. For this to work, you have to let me in. 
Saito gives this a flicker of a smile. Rises. A BODYGUARD opens double doors which give onto a LAVISH PARTY. 
SAITO Gentlemen. Enjoy your evening as I consider your proposal. 
They watch Saito leave. Arthur turns to Cobb, worried- 
ARTHUR He knows. 
Cobb motions silence. A TREMOR starts, they steady their glasses, Cobb glances at his watch- THE SECOND HAND IS FROZEN. 
ARTHUR What's going on up there? 
And we- 
CUT TO: 
FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME) 
Cobb, ASLEEP, SITTING IN A CHAIR AT THE END OF A STEAMING BATH. The chair is up on a cabinet- the bottom of the legs level with the rim of the tub. 
INT. HALL, JAPANESE CASTLE-CONTINUOUS 
Cobb SLIPS through the shadows towards a GUARD stationed at the head of a GRAND STAIRCASE... 
The Guard HEARS something- TURNS- PEERS into the shadows... 
Cobb FLASHES out of the shadows, silenced pistol up, AIMING- 
PHHT- head shot- the Guard starts to drop... but Cobb is already there to CATCH him, sliding on his knees and lowering the Guard SILENTLY to the floor. 
INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS 
Cobb moves to a PAINTING. With practiced hands he removes it from the wall, revealing a SAFE. Cobb spins the dial, pulls it OPEN, GRABS an envelope from within, stuffs it into his waistband, where there is already an IDENTICAL ENVELOPE. 
LIGHTS COME ON. Cobb freezes. 
SAITO (O.S.) Turn around. 
Cobb turns. At the far end of the room: Saito. Next to him is Mal, gun in hand. She smiles at Cobb. 
MAL The gun, Dom. 
Cobb doesn't move. Mal motions outside- two GUARDS drag Arthur into the room. Mal puts the gun to his head. 
MAL Please. 
Cobb slowly places his gun at his end of the long table, then SLIDES it along the polished ebony. It comes to rest HALFWAY down the length or the table. 
SAITO Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb. 
Cobb reaches into his waistband, removes ONE of the envelopes, SLIDES it along the table. Steps back, hands raised. 
COBB Did she tell you, or have you known all along? 
SAITO That you're here to steal from me? (beat) Or that we're actually asleep? 
Arthur gives Cobb an I-told-you-so look. 
SAITO I want to know who your employer is. 
Mal COCKS the gun at Arthur's temple. 
COBB No point threatening him in a dream. 
MAL That depends on what you're threatening. Killing him would just wake him up... but pain? Pain is in the mind... 
Mal LOWERS the gun and SHOOTS Arthur in the leg- Arthur drops, SCREAMING- Mal looks at Cobb, cold. 
MAL And, judging by the decor, we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur? 
Cobb watches Arthur's PAIN. Mal aims at Arthur's other leg... 
Cobb SPRINGS for the table, SKIDDING along its polished surface- he GRABS his gun- SHOOTS ARTHUR BETWEEN THE EYES- 
Arthur DROPS- the room starts to SHUDDER in a MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE- Cobb SPRINGS for the door- Arthur's eyes stare at the ceiling, DEAD, and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY 
Arthur's EYES OPEN as he WAKES IN THE ARMCHAIR- he GRABS at the tubes at his wrist, YANKING them free- 
NASH What're you doing?! It's too soon- 
FLUID spurts from the tubes as Arthur STRUGGLES with the SILVER CASE on the bathroom floor. 
ARTHUR I know! We have to reconnect the loop before they wake up! 
Arthur grabs the case and pushes through the door to the bedroom- following the tubes to where they meet Saito's wrist- SAITO LIES ON THE BED ASLEEP. Saito STIRS and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. JAPANESE CASTLE CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Cobb LURCHES towards the stairs, as all around him the building BUCKS and HEAVES- 
INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS 
Saito and the Guards PANIC. Mal walks calmly through the destruction, picks up the envelope and turns to Saito. 
MAL He was close. Very close. 
EXT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS 
Cobb runs up the stairs, pulling out the SECOND ENVELOPE- 
INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS 
Saito RIPS open the envelope, pulls out sheets of paper. He looks at Mal, PANICKED. He turns to the Guards- 
SAITO Stop him! 
Mal, confused, looks at the sheets of paper: THEY ARE BLANK. Mal smiles, amused. 
INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS 
As Cobb runs up the stairs he reads the TYPEWRITTEN SHEETS from his envelope, and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Arthur OPENS the silver case: a COMPLEX MECHANISM of TUBES, SYRINGES, DOSAGE CONTROLLERS. Arthur's hands fly across the machine's controls as he glances at Saito's STIRRING face- 
ARTHUR I'm not going to make it! Wake Cobb! 
INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Nash turns to Cobb. Raises his hand and SMACKS him across the face, and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT 
Cobb is SMASHED sideways off his feet... 
INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT 
The CEILING CRACKS above Saito- he looks up as a TON of STONE floods down, CRUSHING HIM and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
In the distant background, strange MASSIVE low-end MUSICAL start, sounding like DISTANT HORNS... 
SAITO So leave me and go. 
COBB You know the corporation who hired us won't accept failure. We won't last two days... 
The DISTANT, SLOWED-DOWN MUSIC is becoming LOUDER, as are the SHOUTS coming up the stairs. Arthur looks at his watch, its SLOW SECOND TICKING MARKS TIME WITH THE MASSIVE MUSIC. 
ARTHUR Come on, Cobb. 
COBB So now I have to do this the old- fashioned way- 
Cobb GRABS SAITO AND PUTS HIS HEAD TO THE FLOOR, gun pressed into his cheek. Saito looks into Cobb's eyes- sees he will pull the trigger. Saito BLINKS, looks away in shame- 
When he NOTICES SOMETHING. And starts LAUGHING. 
SAITO I've always hated this carpet. 
Cobb's eyes flick to the carpet and back. 
SAITO It's stained and frayed in such distinctive ways... 
Cobb looks up at Nash, who shrugs, at a loss. 
SAITO But very definitely made of wool. Right now I'm lying on polyester. 
Cobb glares at Nash, and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY 
Todashi watches the first of the countdowns hit ZERO- He looks up at Arthur, STIRRING, and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM-DAY 
Saito turns from the carpet to look up at Cobb. 
SAITO Which means I'm not lying on my carpet, in my apartment... (smiles) You've lived up to your reputation, Mr. Cobb... I'm still dreaming. 
Cobb looks over to Arthur, but ARTHUR HAS VANISHED, and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY 
Arthur's eyes flicker open, AWAKE. He RIPS at his tubes. 
TODASHI How'd it go? 
ARTHUR Not good. 
Arthur checks the remaining three countdowns, and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Saito gets to his feet, looking admiringly at Cobb. 
SAITO A dream within a dream-I'm impressed. 
Cobb lowers the gun. Defeated. Glances at his watch. The music REVERBERATES, the RIOTERS BANG ON THE DOOR, and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY 
Arthur retracts the tubes into the case as he watches the next countdown hit ZERO, and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Another BANG on the door- Saito, confident now, approaches Cobb. Nash is behind Saito. 
SAITO But in my dream, we really ought to be playing by my rules... 
NASH Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito- 
Saito turns to Nash- 
COBB We're not in your dream- 
Saito turns back to Cobb, BUT COBB HAS VANISHED- 
NASH We're in mine. 
Saito SPINS back to Nash- the DOOR SMASHES OFF ITS HINGES AS RIOTERS POUR INTO THE ROOM, SWARMING OVER NASH... BUT NASH IS GONE. The music DIES. Saito and the rioters stand there in the SILENCE, the light DWINDLING... and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY 
Nash' eyes open, AWAKE. 
ARTHUR (O.S.) Asshole! 
Nash BLINKS. Arthur is in his face, furious. 
ARTHUR How could you get the carpet wrong?! 
NASH It wasn't my fault! 
ARTHUR You're the architect- 
NASH I didn't know he was going to rub his damn cheek on it! 
Cobb pulls Arthur away from Nash. 
COBB Lets go. 
ARTHUR And you-what the hell was all that? 
INT. HELICOPTER ON PAD - CONTINUOUS 
Nash, BEATEN BLOODY, sits on the far side, slumped against the wine. Beside him: SAITO. He nods politely at Cobb. 
SAITO He sold you out. Thought to come to me and bargain for his life... 
Saito's BODYGUARD offers Cobb a GUN. 
SAITO So I offer you the satisfaction. 
COBB That's not how I deal with things. 
SAITO Would you work with him again? 
Cobb shakes his head. Saito's BODYGUARDS PULL Nash from the chopper. Saito motions Cobb and Arthur to sit. The chopper RISES. Cobb watches Nash DRAGGED across the pad. 
COBB What will you do to him? 
SAITO Nothing. But I can't speak for your friends from Cobol Engineering. 
Saito looks out at the city slipping by. 
COBB What do you want from us? 
SAITO Inception. 
Arthur raises his eyebrows. Cobb is poker-faced. 
SAITO Is it possible? 
ARTHUR Of course not. 
SAITO If you can steal an idea from someone's mind, why can't you plant one there instead? 
ARTHUR Okay, here's planting an idea: I say to you, "Don't think about elephants." (MORE) ARTHUR (CONT'D) (Saito nods) What are you thinking about? 
SAITO Elephants. 
ARTHUR Right. But it's not your idea because you know I gave it to you. 
SAITO You could plant it subconsciously- 
ARTHUR The subject's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea. True inspiration is impossible to fake. 
COBB No, it isn't. 
SAITO Can you do it? 
COBB I won't do it. 
SAITO In exchange, I'll give you the information you were paid to steal. 
COBB Are you giving me a choice? Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol. 
SAITO Then you do have a choice. 
COBB And I choose to leave. 
EXT. AIRFIELD - MOMENTS LATER 
The helicopter sets down next to a PRIVATE JET. 
INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS 
Saito indicates the plane. 
SAITO Tell the crew where you want to go, they'll file the plan en route. 
Cobb and Arthur look at each other. Then move for the door. 
SAITO Mr. Cobb...? There is one other thing I could offer you. (Cobb stops) How would you like to go home? To America. To your children. 
Cobb turns back to Saito. 
COBB You can't fix that. Nobody could. 
SAITO Just like inception. 
Cobb considers this. Arthur touches his arm. 
ARTHUR Cobb, come on- 
COBB How complex is the idea? 
SAITO Simple enough. 
COBB No idea's simple when you have to plant it in someone else's mind. 
SAITO My main competitor is an old man in poor health. His son will soon inherit control of the corporation. I need him to decide to break up his father's empire. Against his own self-interest. 
ARTHUR Cobb, we should walk away from this. 
COBB If I were to do it. If I could do it... how do I know you can deliver? 
SAITO You don't. But I can. So do you want to take a leap of faith, or become an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone? 
Cobb looks at Saito. Barely nods. 
SAITO Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb. And choose your people more wisely. 
INT. PRIVATE JET - LATER 
Cobb reclines his seat. Arthur picks at a salad, angry. 
ARTHUR I know how much you want to go home- 
COBB (sharp) No, you don't. 
ARTHUR But this can't be done. 
COBB It can. You just have to go deep enough. 
ARTHUR You don't know that!- 
COBB I've done it before. 
Arthur is taken aback. Cobb turns to the window. 
ARTHUR Did it work? 
MILES If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has a job offer to discuss with you. 
ARIADNE A work placement? 
COBB (smiles Not exactly. 
EXT. ROOFTOP, ÉCOLE D'ARCHITECTURE - MOMENTS LATER 
Ariadne leans against the parapet, overlooking Paris. She unwraps a sandwich, watching Cobb pull out a pad of GRAPH PAPER and a PEN. He offers them. She bites her sandwich. 
COBB A test. 
ARIADNE (mouth full) Aren't you going to tell me anything? 
COBB Before I describe the job, I have to know you could do it. 
ARIADNE Why? 
COBB It's not, strictly speaking, legal. 
Ariadne raises her eyebrows. 
COBB You have two minutes to draw a maze that takes me one minute to solve. 
Ariadne takes the pad and pen. Cobb looks at his watch. 
COBB Go. 
She starts DRAWING LINES on the grid, constructing a maze. 
COBB Stop. 
Ariadne hands the pad and pen to Cobb. He glances at the pad, then, looking her in the eye, TRACES the solution. She is taken aback. Cobb RIPS off the sheet, hands the pad back. 
COBB Again. 
She traces straight lines, CONCENTRATING... 
COBB Stop. 
She hands Cobb the pad, a touch pleased. Cobb solves the puzzle instantly, as before. Her smile falls. 
COBB You'll have to- 
She GRABS the pad, frustrated... but this time she FLIPS it over and starts drawing on the BLANK CARDBOARD of the back. Cobb watches, surprised. He smiles as he sees that she's drawing CIRCLES, creating a maze based on concentric rings. 
Ariadne hands back the pad, defiant. Cobb takes the pen, starts the maze. This time he gets stuck. Nods. 
COBB (working the maze) More like it. 
EXT. NARROW STREET, PARIS - DAY 
Arthur stops at a warehouse door. Consults a piece of paper. 
INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS 
A large, dusty warehouse. The SLIDING DOOR cracks open. Arthur enters. Looks around, approvingly. 
INT. SAME - LATER 
Arthur DRAGS LAWN CHAIRS into the middle of the room. He erects a table. Lays out several SILVER CASES, unpacking them, laying out lines of tubing, MECHANISMS... 
EXT. PARISIAN CAFE - DAY 
Cobb and Ariadne sit at an outdoor table. 
COBB They say we only use a fraction of the true potential of our brains... but they're talking about when we're awake. While we dream, the mind performs wonders. 
ARIADNE Such as? 
COBB How do you imagine a building? You consciously create each aspect, puzzling over it in stages... But sometimes, when your imagination flies- 
ARIADNE I'm discovering it. 
COBB Exactly. Genuine inspiration. 
Cobb leans forwards and draws on the paper table cloth. 
COBB In a dream your mind continuously does that... 
Cobb has drawn a circle made of two arrows. 
COBB It creates and perceives a world simultaneously. So well that you don't feel your brain doing the creating. That's why we can short- circuit the process... 
ARIADNE How? 
COBB By taking over the creating part. 
Cobb draws a straight line between the two arrows. 
COBB This is where you come in. You build the world of the dream. We take the subject into that dream, and let him £111 it with his subconscious 
ARIADNE But are you trying to fool him that the dream is actually real life? 
COBB (nods) While we're in there, We don't want him to realize he's dreaming. 
ARIADNE How could I ever get enough detail to Convince him that it's real? 
COBB Our dreams reel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up we realize things were strange, 
Ariadne gestures around them- 
ARIADNE But all the textures of real life- the stone, the fabric. cars... people... your mind can't create all this. 
COBB It does. Every time you dream. Let me ask you a question: You never remember the beginning of your dreams, do you? You just turn up in the middle of what's going on. 
ARIADNE I guess. 
COBB So... how did we end up at this restaurant? 
ARIADNE We came here from... 
Ariadne trails off, confused. 
COBB How did we get here? Where are we? 
Ariadne THINKS, unable to remember. A FAINT RUMBLE begins. 
ARIADNE Oh my God. We're dreaming. 
COBB Because building dreams out of your own memories is the surest way to lose your grip on what's real and what's a dream. 
ARIADNE Did that happen to you? 
Cobb says nothing. He stands there, starinq at Ariadne. PEOPLE around her stop and look at her, hostile. 
COBB Look, this isn't about me- 
Cobb reaches for Ariadne's arm, turns her to him- 
ARIADNE Is that why you need me to build your dreams? 
A passerby GRABS Ariadne's shoulder- 
COBB Leave her alone- 
More of the crowd join in, PULLING at Ariadne, holding her arms open- Cobb PULLS people off- the crowd PUSHES him away- Cobb sees someone WALKING PURPOSEFULLY through the crowd towards the helpless, Ariadne- it is Mal. She approaches with even strides- Ariadne stares at her, uneasy. 
ARIADNE Wake me up, Cobb. 
As Mal walks, she pulls out a LARGE KNIFE- 
COBB Mal, no! 
ARIADNE Wake me up! 
Ariadne SCREAMS as Mal LUNGES at her with the knife and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. WORKSHOP-DAY 
Ariadne WAKES, BREATHING HARD. Arthur moves to her- 
ARTHUR It's okay. 
ARIADNE Why couldn't I wake? 
ARTHUR The only way to wake from inside the dream is to die. 
Cobb, in the lawn chair opposite, PULLS his tubes out. 
COBB She'll need a totem. 
ARIADNE What? 
ARTHUR Some kind of personal icon. A small object that you can always have with you, and that no one else knows, 
Cobb gets to his feet, Ariadne stares at him, furious. He heads to the bathroom. 
ARIADNE That's some subconscious you've got, Cobb. (calls after him) She's a real charmer! 
ARTHUR Sounds like you've met Mrs. Cobb. 
ARIADNE (surprised) She's his wife? 
Arthur nods, pulling off Ariadne's tubes. 
ARTHUR So. A totem. You need something small, potentially heavy... 
INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS 
Cobb takes out his PEWTER SPINNING TOP, SPINS it on the marble counter... 
INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS 
Ariadne looks at Arthur, puzzled. 
ARIADNE Like a coin? 
ARTHUR Too common. You need something that has a weight or movement that only you know. 
INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS 
Cobb STUDIES the spin of the top as it decays, becoming more and more ECCENTRIC... 
INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS 
ARIADNE What's yours? 
Arthur holds out a DIE. 
ARTHUR A loaded die. 
Ariadne reaches for it- Arthur snatches sit away- 
ARTHUR I can't let you handle it. That's the point. No one else can know the weight or balance of it. 
ARIADNE Why? 
ARTHUR So when you examine your totem... 
INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS 
Cobb's spinning top WOBBLES OVER. 
ARTHUR (O.S.) You know, beyond a doubt, that you're not in someone else's dream. 
Cobb GRABS it like a drowning man reaching for a lifeline. 
INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS 
Ariadne thinks this over. 
ARIADNE That's not an issue for me. 
ARTHUR Why not? 
ARIADNE Arthur, maybe you can't see what's going on, maybe you don't want to. But Cobb's got problems he's tried to bury down there. I'm not going to open my mind to someone like that. 
Ariadne gets to her feet. Walks away. 
COBB (O.S.) She'll be back. 
Arthur turns. Cobb is standing in the bathroom doorway. 
COBB I've never seen anyone pick it up so fast. And one reality won't be enough for her now. When she comes back, get her building mazes. 
ARTHUR Where will you be? 
EAMES Freddy! 
The Businessman looks up, awkward. 
EAMES Freddy Simmonds, it is you! 
Cobb nonchalantly SLIPS over the balcony DROPPING HARD into the midst of the crowd on the street below. 
EAMES (looks harder) Oh. No, it isn't. 
EXT. STREET, MOMBASA - CONTINUOUS 
Cobb stands up, PUSHES into the crowd- faces PEER at him- he moves, trying to blend- TURNS- a SECOND BUSINESS MAN is there. 
COBB (disarming smile) Yes? 
SECOND BUSINESSMAN We need to- 
Cobb HEAD BUTTS the Second Businessman, PUSHES past him- 
The First Businessman races out of the bar, sees Cobb's wake, DIVES after him- Cobb RACES headlong through tight passageways, WEAVING through or KNOCKING into the locals... 
He steps into a dark, crowded cafe, scanning the tables... the First Businessman enters, spots him. An AFRICAN MAN gets in Cobb's face, jabbering at him in Swahili- Cobb considers his options... the First Businessman DRAWS A GUN- Cobb bolts, steps up on a table and out an open window, SCRAMBLING into the alley outside... 
Cobb LOOKS left, right... CUTS LEFT into a narrow, CROWDED alley- the alley NARROWS TO A DEAD END. Faces in the CROWD start to watch Cobb- PEOPLE start to SURROUND him- Cobb looks back the way he came- the two Businessmen are there, GUNS DRAWN- 
Cobb sees a SMALL GAP between the buildings at the narrow end- he THROWS himself into it- gets STUCK HALFWAY... 
The crowd bears down, GRABBING for him as Cobb struggles to SQUEEZE HIMSELF through the gap... Cobb's moving INCHES as his pursuers gain YARDS... the Crowd is upon him... he BURSTS FREE. TUMBLING onto the next street, ROLLING out of sight. 
Cobb Jumps to his feet- in a market square. TWO MORE BUSINESSMEN move towards him. Cobb BOLTS but a CAR SKIDS UP, BLOCKS HIS PATH- the door opens- SAITO IS IN THE BACK. 
SAITO Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb? 
COBB (jumping in) What brings you to Mombasa, Mr. Saito? 
SAITO I have to protect my investment. 
EXT. COFFEE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
Eames stands on the pavement. The car pulls up. Cobb beckons from the rear window. Eames looks at Saito. Back to Cobb. 
EAMES This is your idea of losing a tail? 
COBB (shrugs) Different tail. 
INT. WORKSHOP - DAY 
Arthur sits at the table, working on a mechanism. A small COUGH prompts him to look up: Ariadne is there. 
ARTHUR He said you'd be back. 
ARIADNE I tried not to come. 
ARTHUR But there's nothing else quite like it. 
ARIADNE No paper, no pens... nothing between you and raw, direct creation. 
Arthur picks up his mechanism. 
ARTHUR Shall we take a look at paradoxical architecture? 
Ariadne nods, takes off her coat and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. PENROSE STEPS - LATER 
Arthur leads Ariadne down some busy steps in a large glass and steel ATRIUM in an office complex. 
ARTHUR You're going to have to master a few tricks if you're going to build three complete dream levels. 
A SECRETARY DROPS some papers as they pass... 
ARIADNE What sort of tricks? 
They take a tight turn and continue down the next flight. 
ARTHUR In a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes. (MORE) ARTHUR (CONT'D) That lets you create closed loops, like the Penrose Steps. The infinite staircase. 
Ariadne FREEZES- THEY ARE IN THE EXACT SPOT THEY STARTED DESCENDING FROM, next to the Secretary gathering her papers. 
Ariadne puzzles at the impossible construction of the stairs. 
ARTHUR See... 
Arthur stops her gently- they are on the highest step, with a LARGE DROP to the next step. Arthur gestures at the drop. 
ARTHUR Paradox. A closed loop like this helps you disguise the boundaries of the dream you've created. 
ARIADNE How big do the levels have to be? 
ARTHUR Anything from the floor of a building, to an entire city. But it has to be complicated enough for us to hide from the projections. 
ARIADNE A maze. 
ARTHUR And the better the maze- 
ARIADNE The longer we have before the projections catch us. 
Ariadne looks around. Sees people LOOKING at Arthur. 
ARIADNE My subconscious seems polite enough. 
ARTHUR You wait, they'll turn ugly. No one likes to see someone else messing around in their mind. 
ARIADNE Cobb can't build anymore, can he? 
ARTHUR I don't know if he can't, but he won't. He thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts. 
ARIADNE Why? 
ARTHUR He won't tell me. I think it's Mal. I think she's getting stronger. 
ARIADNE His ex-wife? 
ARTHUR She's not his ex. 
ARIADNE They're still together? 
Two AFRICAN PEDESTRIANS wander into view. 
ARTHUR Are those yours? 
Eames shakes his head. Cobb turns to Yusuf. 
ARTHUR Yusuf? 
YUSUF Yup. Sorry. 
COBB Suppress them. We don't bring our own projections into the dream-we let Fischer's subconscious supply the people. 
EAMES Saito, when do I get to see Browning? 
SAITO You fly out to Sydney on Tuesday. We've arranged for you to spend several days... 
INT. ANTEROOM, MAURICE FISCHER'S OFFICE - DAY 
Eames sits in the crowded room. Boxes and files are piled high. Browning stands by a pair of double doors. 
SAITO (V.O.) ...as part of a consulting litigation team working for Browning. 
BROWNING I'm not smelling settlement here-we take them down. 
LAWYER Mr. Browning, Maurice Fischer's policy is always one of avoiding litigation- 
Browning turns to the lawyer. Calm, but POWERFUL. 
BROWNING Shall we relay your concerns directly to Maurice? 
Browning opens the doors to Maurice Fischer's inner office. Eames leans in to watch as Browning beckons the Lawyer into- 
INT. MAURICE FISCHER'S INNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
The office is a MAKESHIFT HOSPITAL ROOM: a BED where the desk should be. Browning addresses a figure at the window. ROBERT FISCHER, 30'S, abstracted. 
BROWNING How is he? 
Fischer turns to Browning. Motions silence, as he glances at his FATHER in the bed. Wheezing gently. 
BROWNING I don't want to bother him unnecessarily but I know he- 
FATHER Robert! I've told you to keep out the damn!- 
MAURICE LASHES OUT, KNOCKING things from his bedside table. A NURSE calms Maurice as Fischer crouches to retrieve a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH. He looks at the photo through the broken glass- a YOUNG BOY holds a PINWHEEL CLEARLY MADE BY A CHILD (each of the points is numbered in pen), his FATHER blows on it. 
BROWNING Must be a cherished memory of his- 
FISCHER I put it by his bed. He hasn't even noticed. 
BROWNING Robert, we have to talk about a power of attorney. I know this is hard for you, but it's important that we start to think about the future- 
FISCHER Not now, Uncle Peter. 
Browning looks at Fischer, considering. Biding his time. 
EAMES (V.O.) The vultures are circling. The sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the stronger Peter Browning becomes... 
Eames WATCHES Browning, STUDYING his every move . 
INT. BATHROOM - DAY 
Eames gestures at a mirror, as if offering to shake hands... 
EAMES (V.O.) I've had time to learn Browning's physical presence and mannerisms... In the mirror: BROWNING GESTURES BACK. 
INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS 
EAMES Now, in the dream, I can impersonate Browning and suggest the concepts to Fischer's conscious mind... (draws a diagram) Then we take Fischer down another level and his own subconscious feeds it right back to him. 
ARTHUR (impressed) So he gives himself the idea. 
EAMES Precisely. That's the only way to make it stick. It has to seem self-generated. 
ARTHUR Eames, I'm impressed. 
EAMES Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DESERTED HOTEL LOBBY - DAY 
The team sit on the steps of the large marble lobby, debating. Ariadne is showing Arthur the lobby. 
EAMES He's not scheduled for surgery, no dental, nothing. 
COBB I thought he had some knee thing? 
EAMES Nothing they'd put him under for. Besides, we need a good ten hours. 
SAITO Sydney to Los Angeles. 
They turn to Saito. 
SAITO Twelve hours and forty-five minutes-one of the longest flights in the world. He makes it every two weeks... 
EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY 
Fischer steps out of a black town car and walks across the tarmac towards a GULF STREAM JET, accompanied by two aides. 
COBB (V.O.) Surely he flies private? 
SAITO (V.O.) Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane. 
Fischer is met at the steps by a DISTRAUGHT FLIGHT OFFICER. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY 
Cobb chews this over. Arthur comes over. 
ARTHUR It'd have to be a 747. 
COBB Why? 
ARTHUR On a 747 the pilots are up above, first class is in the nose so nobody walks through the cabin. We'd have to buyout the whole cabin, and the first class flight attendant- 
SAITO We bought the airline. 
Everyone turns to Saito. 
Ariadne looks into the room to see Cobb and Mal talking, arguing. A private moment. Mal brushes at Cobb's hair, trying to convince him. We hear snatches of conversation- 
MAL You remember when you asked me to marry you? 
COBB Of course... 
MAL You said you had a dream... 
COBB That we'd grow old together. 
MAL And we can. You know how to find me... you know what you have to do. 
Cobb is shaking his head, gently. Mal looks into Cobb's eyes- gentle, loving... Mal SPOTS Ariadne spying on them. 
FREEZES, staring, hostile. Cobb turns, sees Ariadne, moves towards her, leaving Mal. 
COBB You shouldn't be in here. 
Cobb guides her back into the elevator. 
ARIADNE I wanted to know what "tests" you need to do on your own every night. 
INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - DAY 
Cobb shuts the CAGE DOOR. Ariadne hits a button. The elevator RISES. Through the GRILL Ariadne can see a BEACH stretching off into the distance. The elevator stops. Mal sits on the sand. Beside her, the two children are crouched, away from us, building a SANDCASTLE. 
ARIADNE Why do you do this to yourself? 
COBB This is the only way I can still dream. 
ARIADNE Is it so important to dream? 
Cobb stares at his family. 
COBB In my dreams... we're still together. 
The kids, WITHOUT TURNING AROUND, jump up and RUN AWAY. 
INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 
The elevator descends. 
ARIADNE But these aren't just dreams, are they? They're memories. You said never to use memories. 
COBB And I shouldn't. 
ARIADNE You're keeping her alive. 
COBB No. 
ARIADNE You can't let her go. 
COBB No. These are moments I regret. Moments I turned into dreams so I could change them. 
Ariadne's fingers move across the buttons- stop at the "B." 
ARIADNE What've you got buried down there that you regret? 
Cobb pushes her hand away. Hits the third floor button. 
COBB There's only one thing I need you to understand about me... 
INT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
Ariadne follows Cobb into the kitchen. A THIN MAN is there, standing by the table. He holds a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER. 
ARIADNE This is your house? 
COBB Mine and Mal's. 
ARIADNE Where is she? 
COBB She'd already died. 
The Thin Man offers Cobb the piece of paper. A CHILD'S SHOUT- Cobb TURNS. Ariadne follows his gaze to the garden. A small blonde boy faces away from them, crouched on his haunches to look at something on the ground. 
COBB It's James. My boy. He's found something. Maybe a worm. 
A slightly older girl RUNS into view. 
COBB And there's Philippa. 
She crouches beside the boy. Their FACES ARE AWAY FROM US. They point and discuss whatever is on the ground. 
COBB I thought about calling out, so they'd turn and smile those incredible smiles... but I'm out of time- 
The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand. 
THIN MAN Right now. Or never, Cobb. 
Cobb nods, turns from the window- 
COBB Then I panic that I'll always wish I'd seen them turn, that I can't waste this chance... 
Cobb TURNS BACK to call out- but the children RACE OFF... 
COBB But the moment's passed. And whatever I do, the dream's always the same... When I'm about to call... they run. 
Cobb watches them run off, calling for grandma, FACES UNSEEN. 
COBB If I'm going to see their faces again-I've got to get back here in the real world... 
Behind him, Ariadne SLAMS the grill shut. Cobb TURNS. 
INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 
Ariadne hits the BASEMENT button. The elevator starts to DESCEND. ariadne STARES, fascinated as glimpses of floors slip past: Mal's childhood bedroom, a thundering wall of freight train... The elevator STOPS. Through the grill Ariadne sees a HOTEL SUITE. She pulls open the grill, steps cautiously out into- 
INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS (NOW NIGHT) 
DISHEVELED bedclothes, UPENDED room service table, STRAWBERRIES across the floor. A STRUGGLE. Ariadne steps forwards- SMASH- she looks down to see that she has kicked over a CHAMPAGNE FLUTE. Ariadne feels a draught. The CURTAIN BILLOWS. 
MAL (O.S.) What are you doing here? 
Ariadne TURNS. Mal is there. 
ARIADNE My name is- 
MAL I know who you are. What are you doing here? 
Fischer takes a beat. But Cobb seems harmless. 
FISCHER Actually, he was my father. 
COBB I'm very sorry for your loss. He was an inspiring figure. 
The Flight Attendant brings their drinks- Cobb takes them. 
COBB Thanks. 
As he turns to Fischer he LOWERS his right hand ... a CLEAR LIQUID DROPS into Fischer's water as Cobb hands it to him. 
COBB To Maurice Fischer. (they drink) I'll leave you in peace. 
Fischer grants him a smile. 
EXT. 747 - LATER 
The great plane SOARS through a burning cloudscape. 
INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - MOMENTS LATER 
Cobb reaches into the overhead for a blanket- lets it fall onto Fischer's head- Fischer doesn't flinch. ASLEEP. Cobb SIGNALS the others. The First Flight Attendant unlocks a CUPBOARD in the galley, then leaves, closing the curtain. Arthur moves into the galley and pulls out a MECHANISM CASE. 
Cobb and Arthur open the mechanism- uncoil the tubes- feed them around the window side of each of the seats. Arthur rolls up Fischer's cuff- PUSHES the needle cap into Fischer's wrist. Arthur pulls Fischer's cuff down and hides the tubes behind the armrest of Fischer's seat. 
Arthur runs the next tube to Ariadne. Cobb puts the case on Yusuf's lap. Yusuf checks the TIMERS, tapping the syringes. The others recline their seats. Yusuf HITS A BUTTON- closes the case- places it at his feet. He settles back, and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. SEDAN - DAY 
Cobb DRIVES. Saito and Arthur are in the back. Rain BEATS down. Cobb pulls over- 
EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS 
Yusuf stands on the corner, silver briefcase in hand, collar turned up against the rain. He reaches for the door. 
INT. SEDAN - CONTINUOUS 
Yusuf clambers into the back, brushing rain from his face. 
ARTHUR (indicates rain) Couldn't you have peed before you went under? 
YUSUF Sorry. 
The front door OPENS and Eames climbs in, soaked. 
EAMES Bit too much free champagne before takeoff, Yusuf? 
YUSUF Ha bloody ha. 
COBB At least we know he'll be looking for a cab in this. 
INT./EXT. SEDAN ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS 
Cobb pulls out into the heavy traffic. He weaves around several cars before lining up behind a YELLOW CAB. 
COBB Brace yourselves. 
Cobb hits the gas- REAR ENDS the cab with a CRUNCH. The CABDRIVER gets out, fuming. Heads to Cobb's window- 
CABDRIVER Hey, asshole! Why don't you try driving without your thumb up- 
He sees the SILENCED PISTOL Cobb is holding at his belly. 
COBB Walk away. 
The Cabdriver backs off. Arthur climbs into the cab. Both cars pull away. 
INT./EXT. CAB ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS 
Arthur SLOWS in front of the TRAIN STATION, peering at the pedes pedestrians. He SPOTS Fischer, lights the cab's sign. Fischer FLAGS him down. Fischer JUMPS into the back, brushing rain from his shoulders. 
FISCHER Third and Market. Snappy. 
Eames JUMPS in from the other side. 
FISCHER What're you doing? 
EAMES Sorry, I thought it was free. Maybe we could share. 
FISCHER Maybe not. 
Saito gets into the front passenger seat. Pointing a gun. 
FISCHER Great. 
Arthur pulls away. Fischer pulls out his wallet and tosses it at Eames. 
FISCHER (contemptuous) There's 500 dollars in there. And the wallet's worth more than that. For that you ought to at least drop me at my stop. 
Eames smiles at this. 
EAMES I'm afraid- 
A SHOT SHATTERS the window by Eames's head- another SHOT IMPACTS by Saito- 
EAMES Get us out of here! 
Arthur hits the gas, but a BLACK S.U.V. SKIDS sideways in front, BLOCKING the path- 
A BLOCK BEHIND- Cobb is at a light. ARIADNE is getting in the front. Cobb has HEARD the GUNFIRE- 
COBB Come on!- 
Cobb looks ahead to the AMBUSH, hits the gas- the sedan ROCKETS forwards... but BAM- A FREIGHT TRAIN CLIPS THE FRONT OF THE SEDAN, SHOVING IT SIDEWAYS AS AN ENDLESS TRAIN BARRELS PAST, A WALL BETWEEN COBB AND THE AMBUSH- 
A SECOND S.U.V. is behind the cab- PLAIN CLOTHES SECURITY MEN advance through the traffic, weapons trained on the cab. Bullets RIP into the cab as Eames throws himself on top of Fischer, PULLING a SACK over his head- 
Inside the sedan, Ariadne watches the train passing- 
ARIADNE This wasn't in the design- 
Cobb BACKS UP, SPINS around, heading for the tail of the train- 
A Security Man emerges from the front S.U.V. carrying an AUTOMATIC RIFLE- he steps towards the cab through the rain, raises his weapon and BLASTS THE CAB'S WINDSCREEN- 
Cobb clears the end of the train, and SKIDS across the tracks- 
ARTHUR Oh, yeah? With Mal? That worked out great, didn't it, Cobb? 
Cobb grabs Arthur. 
COBB You don't know anything about that. This was the only way to do this job, Arthur. I did what I had to do to get back to my children. 
EAMES So you led us into a war zone with no way out. 
COBB We have a way out. The kick. We just have to push on, do the job as fast as possible and get out using the kick. 
EAMES Forget it. We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes. I'm sitting it out on this level. 
COBB You'll never make it, Eames. Fischer's security is surrounding this place as we speak. The ten hours of the flight is a week at this level-you'll never make it without getting killed. Downwards is the only way forwards. We have to carry on. 
Saito groans. Cobb looks at him- 
COBB And we have to do it fast. 
Eames and Arthur weigh this. 
COBB Eames, go get ready. Arthur, let's get in there and soften him up. 
INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - LATER 
Cobb and Arthur, wearing BALACLAVAS, PULL the sack from Fischer's head. He is chained to the radiator. 
FISCHER I'm insured against kidnapping up to ten million-this'll be simple- 
COBB No, it won't. 
Fischer looks at Cobb, unnerved. 
ARTHUR In. your lather's office, below the bookshelves, is his personal safe. We need the combination. 
FISCHER I never noticed a safe- 
COBB Doesn't mean you don't know the combination. 
FISCHER Well, I don't. 
ARTHUR We have it on good authority that you do. 
FISCHER Whose? 
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Yusuf looks through Fischer's wallet. Eames is opening a HINGED, THREE-WING MIRROR. 
YUSUF Five hundred dollars, this cost? 
EAMES What's inside? 
YUSUF Cash, cards, ID... and this- 
Yusuf holds up a SNAPSHOT: the photo from Maurice Fischer's office- YOUNG ROBERT holds his HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, his FATHER blows on it. Eames takes it from Yusuf. STUDIES it. Cobb enters. Eames hands him the snapshot. 
EAMES Useful? 
Cobb studies the snapshot. Eames examines himself in the hinged mirror from multiple angles: ONE BY ONE the myriad Eames reflections BECOME BROWNINGS. Cobb pockets the photo. 
COBB You're on. You've got an hour. 
EAMES An hour? I was supposed to have all night to crack him. 
COBB And Saito was supposed to keep his guts on the inside. You've got an hour-get something we can use. 
Eames turns from the mirror AS BROWNING. He glances at his watch, then SCREAMS, as if begging for mercy- 
INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Browning's CRY reverberates- Fischer looks up, concerned- 
FISCHER What's that? 
ARTHUR Good authority. 
Another cry rings out. Fischer recognizes the voice. 
FISCHER Uncle Peter?! Make them stop- 
ARTHUR The combination. 
FISCHER I don't know it! 
ARTHUR Why would Browning tell us you did? 
FISCHER Let me talk to him-I'll find out. 
INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
Cobb pushes Browning (Eames), bloody and bruised, into the room and forces him down next to Fischer. Cobb handcuffs Browning's wrist to a metal bracket on the side of the sink. 
COBB You've got an hour. Get talking. 
Cobb leaves. 
BROWNING (EAMES) They've had me for two days. They've got someone with access to your father's office and they're trying to open his safe-they thought I'd know the combination, but I don't- 
FISCHER Neither do I, Uncle Peter. 
BROWNING (confused) Maurice told me that after he passed only you would be able to open it. 
FISCHER He never gave me the combination. 
Browning thinks for a minute. Realizes something. 
BROWNING He did, he just didn't tell you that it was a combination. 
FISCHER What, then? 
BROWNING Something only you would know. Some meaningful combination of numbers from your experiences with Maurice- 
FISCHER We didn't have a lot of meaningful experiences together. 
BROWNING Perhaps after your mother died... 
FISCHER After my mother died, I went to him in my grief. (MORE) FISCHER (CONT'D) You know what he told me? "There's really nothing to be said, Robert." 
BROWNING He always had a hard time with emotional- 
COBB She... she believed they weren't real. That our real children were waiting. Somewhere above... 
INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK) 
Mal shakes her head at Cobb as he USHERS the children out of the room, FACES UNSEEN- 
COBB Calm down, Mal- 
MAL They're projections, Dom. Your dreams. I'm their mother-don't you think I can tell the difference? 
Cobb closes the door- turns to her, eyes full of bitter tears. 
COBB If it's my dream then why can't I control it? Why can't I stop this? 
MAL (it's obvious) You don't know you're dreaming. 
COBB You keep telling me I am- 
MAL And you don't believe me! 
COBB (V.O.) She was certain. But she loved me too much to go without me. So she made a plan... 
INT. ELEGANT HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
Cobb walks along, checking door numbers against a key. 
COBB (V.O.) For our anniversary... 
INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK) 
Cobb enters the lavish suite. He notices the DISHEVELED BEDCLOTHES. 
He steps forwards- SMASH- he has tipped over a champagne glass with his foot... dinner for two is SPREAD ACROSS THE FLOOR. He looks at the DEBRIS, confused... next to the broken glass is a SPINNING TOP. He picks it up, studying it, thinking. He feels a draught, looks to the window. The CURTAIN BILLOWS. 
EXT. EXTERIOR ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK) 
Cobb looks out the window: Mal sits on the ledge of the opposite window. HAIR BLOWING. Feet dangling over the dizzyingly high atrium. She smiles. 
MAL Join me. 
COBB Mal, come back inside. 
MAL No. I'm going to jump. And you're coming with me. 
COBB No, I'm not. This is real-if you jump, you're not going to wake up, you're going to die. Let's go back inside and talk about this, please. 
MAL We've talked enough. 
She KICKS off a shoe and watches it DROP. 
MAL Come out onto the ledge or I'll jump right now. 
She means it. Cobb swings his legs out, sitting on the ledge opposite is wife. He looks down at the drop. 
MAL I'm asking you to take a leap of faith. 
COBB I can't do that, Mal. I can't leave our children. 
MAL If I go without you, they'll take them away, anyway. 
COBB What do you mean? 
MAL I filed a letter with our attorney. Explaining how I'm fearful for my safety, how you've threatened to kill me... 
Cobb looks back at the wrecked hotel suite, PANICKING... 
MAL (CONT'D) I love you, Dom. I've freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them. We're going home to our real children. 
COBB Out children are here, Mal. 
Mal CLOSES HER EYES. Cobb looks for some way to reach her... 
MAL You're waiting for a train... 
COBB NO! MAL, NO, I CAN'T! 
MAL A train that will take you far away... 
COBB DON'T DO THIS! 
MAL You know where you hope this train will take you, you can't know for sure... 
COBB DON'T! 
MAL But it doesn't matter... 
COBB NO! 
MAL Because you'll be together... 
Mal SLIPS FORWARD INTO SPACE. Cobb SCREAMS after her. Then tries to bury his face in the wall... 
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - DAY 
Cobb stares as he remembers. 
COBB He letter to the authorities refuted all the claims about her sanity that she knew I'd make... 
INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK) 
Cobb stands with the Thin Man, who has a piece of paper. 
COBB (V.O.) She'd had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists. 
Cobb hears a SHOUT- turns to the garden. James CROUCHES, Philippa joins him, examining the ground, FACES UNSEEN... 
COBB (V.O.) (CONT'D) It was impossible for me to explain the nature of her madness... 
The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand. 
THIN MAN Right now. Or never, Cobb. 
Cobb turns back to the window- about to call out- James and Philippa RUN OFF. Cobb turns from the window. Looks at the paper in his hand. It is an AIRPLANE TICKET. 
COBB (V.O.) So I ran. And I've been running ever since, trying to buy my way back to my family... 
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - DAY 
Cobb looks across at Ariadne. 
EAMES We need the imagery, the words... 
ARIADNE So you destroy his one positive relationship? 
COBB No. We repair his relationship with his father and expose his godfather's true nature. 
EAMES Hell, we should be charging Fischer as much as Saito. 
ARTHUR What about his security? It's going to get worse as we go deeper. 
COBB We bring in Mr. Charles. 
ARTHUR No. 
EAMES Who's Mr. Charles? 
ARTHUR A bad idea. 
COBB Arthur, the second we approach Fischer in that hotel, they're gonna mow us down-we run with Mr. Charles like on the Stein job. 
EAMES So you've done it before? 
ARTHUR Sure. But it didn't work. The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces. 
Eames takes this in. 
EAMES You learned a lot, though. Right? 
COBB (to Eames) I'll need a decoy. 
EAMES No problem. How about a pretty young lady I've used before? 
COBB Fine- 
Cobb looks back: a second S.U.V. pulls out, tailing them. 
COBB (CONT'D) (to Yusuf) I know you've got to stay ahead of them, but drive with kid gloves, okay? The world down there is going to be very unstable- 
ARTHUR And don't make the jump too soon- that kick is our only way back, we have to be ready to catch it- 
YUSUF I'll use the music to let you know when it's coming, but the rest is up to you. 
Arthur puts the mechanism onto the front seat. 
YUSUF (CONT'D) Everyone ready? 
Nods all round. 
YUSUF (CONT'D) Sweet dreams- 
Yusuf hits a button and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - SUNSET 
Fischer nurses a drink. Staring at the ice cracking. 
BLONDE (O.S.) Am I boring you? 
Fischer looks up. A beautiful BLONDE is next to him. 
BLONDE (CONT'D) I was telling you my story. I guess it wasn't to your liking. 
FISCHER I have a lot on my mind. 
Fischer looks around the bar. There are several STERN-LOOKING CHARACTERS paying him too much attention. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 
Arthur and Ariadne sit at a table across the lobby. They spot Cobb moving across the lobby towards Fischer. 
ARTHUR And there goes Mr. Charles. 
ARIADNE Who or what, exactly, is Mr. Charles? 
ARTHUR It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS 
Cobb approaches the bar, watched closely by Fischer's Sub- security. 
COBB Mr. Fishcer! Good to see you again. Rod Green, Marketing. (to Blonde) And you must be... 
BLONDE Leaving. 
She presses against Fischer as she slides off her stool and deposits a cocktail napkin in front of him. 
BLONDE (CONT'D) In case you get bored. 
Cobb watches her walk away. The Sub-security FOLLOWS her. 
COBB I think you just got blown off... unless her phone number really does have only six digits. 
Fischer glances at the napkin: "528-491." 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 
Arthur watches the Sub-security follow the Blonde. 
ARIADNE And why don't you approve? 
ARTHUR Because it involves telling the mark that he's dreaming. Which involves attracting a lot of attention to us. 
ARIADNE Didn't Cobb say never to do that? 
ARTHUR You must've noticed by now how much time Cobb spends doing things he says never to do. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS 
Cobb turns to Fischer. 
COBB Strange way to make friends. (off look) Lifting your wallet, I mean. 
Fischer pats his pocket. Empty. He looks to the lobby where he sees the Sub-security trailing the Blonde. 
FISCHER Goddamn it. The wallet alone's worth- 
COBB Five hundred bucks. I know. Don't worry, my guys are on it. 
The liquid in Fischer's drink RISES UP AGAINST ONE SIDE OF THE GLASS- Fischer notices, confused. 
COBB Very odd-the weather, the gravity... 
Fischer looks around the bar- it's as if THE ENTIRE ROOM IS SET AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE- glasses SLIDING off tables... 
COBB (CONT'D) But I can explain all this. You've actually been trained for this. (Fischer nods) Think of the strangeness of the weather, the shifts in gravity. None of this is real... (MORE) COBB (CONT'D) (beat) We're in a dream. 
Fischer looks at the room around them. Back to Cobb. All through the bar, patrons turn to look at Cobb IN UNISON. 
COBB (CONT'D) The simplest test of what I'm saying is for you to try and remember anything about the way you arrived in this hotel... okay? 
Fischer stares at Cobb, trying to process this. All around them, people STARE at Cobb. Several get up as if to approach. 
COBB (CONT'D) Breathe. Remember the training. Accept the fact that we're in a dream. That's why I'm here protecting you. 
As Fischer considers this we- 
CUT TO: 
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - DAY 
Yusuf STRAIGHTENS UP the van, RACING down the street, swerving through traffic and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - EVENING 
The building gradually EASES BACK INTO ALIGNMENT- 
FISCHER So you... you're not real? 
The bar patrons start to ignore Cobb again. 
COBB No. I'm a projection of your subconscious. I was put in place to protect you in the event that extractors pulled you into a dream. I believe that's what has happened. 
Fischer takes this in. Then looks at the Security Men approaching across the crooked floor, he nods at Cobb- 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING 
Cobb escorts Fischer across the lobby. As he does so, he walks past the two CHILDREN, backs to us- Cobb ignores them- The two Sub-security fall in behind. Cobb hurries Fischer up the stairs- then PUSHES him into- 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Fischer stumbles in- turns to Cobb, angry- 
FISCHER Hey- 
Cobb reaches into his jacket- the First Man BURSTS in- Cobb KICKS him to the ground- DRAWS his gun as the SECOND MAN comes through the door, moving towards Fischer- 
BLAM! Cobb BLASTS the Second Man in the back- TURNS and SHOOTS the First Man. 
FISCHER (CONT'D) Jesus Christ! What are you doing?! 
Cobb turns to Fischer, calm. Convincing. 
COBB Look at the gun in his hand. 
Fischer looks: the Second Man was holding a pistol. Cobb opens the First Man's jacket to show Fischer his holster and sidearm. 
COBB (CONT'D) These men were sent to abduct you. 
Cobb pulls out the gun and HANDS it to Fischer. 
COBB (CONT'D) If I'm going to help you, I need you to be calm. 
Fischer remembers something. 
FISCHER If this is a dream, I have to kill myself and wake up- 
Fischer raises the gun towards his head- 
COBB I wouldn't do that-they've probably got you sedated. If you pull that trigger, you might not wake up, you might drop into a lower dream state. (MORE) COBB (CONT'D) Mr. Fischer, you know all this, you just have to remember it... 
Fischer lowers his gun. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 
Saito walks down the corridor, followed by a Security Man. Saito DUCKS around the corner, moves to a GARBAGE CHUTE and DROPS Fischer's WALLET into it. He SLIPS into the stairwell as the Security Man comes abreast of the chute and pauses. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 
Arthur leads Ariadne to a particular room: 491. 
INT. ROOM 491 - CONTINUOUS 
Arthur leads Ariadne in. He opens the closet, opens the room safe, pulls our FOUR BRICKS OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE. 
ARTHUR So, if everything's correct, this room should be directly below 528. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Cobb looks reassuringly at Fischer. 
COBB What do you remember from before this dream? 
FISCHER (thinking) Rain... gunfire... Uncle Peter. (looks up) Christ-we've been kidnapped. 
COBB Where were they holding you? 
FISCHER They had us... in the back of a van... 
COBB Your body's bouncing around in the back of a van right now-that explains the gravity shifts. 
FISCHER It was... to do with a safe... Christ, why's it so hard to remember? 
COBB It's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up. It takes years of practice to do it easily. So, you and Browning have been pulled into this dream so they can steal something from your mind. What? 
FISCHER They wanted a combination to a safe... they demanded the first numbers to pop into my head. 
COBB That's them extracting a locator. 
FISCHER A locator? 
COBB A number from your own subconscious. It can be used any number of ways... (thinking) This is a hotel. Room numbers. What was the number you gave them? 
FISCHER 5, 2... something... it was a long number. 528... 528, 4 something. 
COBB (opens phone) Well, we know where to start. (into phone) Fifth floor. 
COBB Let's find out what. 
Cobb nods at Arthur, who starts unpacking the mechanism. Browning watches. Silent. 
COBB Let's do to him what he was going to do to you. 
Cobb rolls up his sleeve. Nods at Fischer to do the same. 
COBB We'll penetrate his subconscious and find out what he doesn't want you to know. 
Fischer looks Cobb in the eye. Decides- rolls up his sleeve, offering his bare arm. The team run tubes to each other- Arthur injects Fischer, whose head slumps. 
ARTHUR He's out. 
ARIADNE Wait, Cobb-I'm lost. Whose subconscious are we going into? 
COBB Fischer's. I told him it was Browning's so he'd come with us as part of our team. 
ARTHUR (impressed) He's going to help us break into his own subconscious. 
COBB That's the idea. He'll think that his security is Browning's and fight them to learn the truth about his father. 
Arthur hits buttons on the mechanism. The team goes out one by one. Cobb is last. 
COBB Fischer's subconscious is going to run you down hard. 
ARTHUR I'll lead them on a merry chase. 
COBB Be back in time for the kick. 
ARTHUR I'm on it. 
Cobb is no longer listening- he stares at the net curtains, BILLOWING like those in Mal's suite- a GLIMPSE of someone (Mal?) As the screen goes WHITE, and we are- 
EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY 
CLOSE ON Cobb's face, staring. Fixed. 
ARIADNE (O.S.) Cobb? Cobb? 
Ariadne is beside him. They stand on a cliff, dressed in white snowsuits, carrying white-painted weapons like WWII commandos. Cobb checks his SNIPER RIFLE, examines their objective: a massive FORTIFIED MEDICAL FACILITY a mile below. 
ARIADNE What's down there? 
COBB Hopefully, the truth we want Fischer to learn. 
ARIADNE I meant what's down there for you? 
Cobb turns to her. Eames, Saito and Fischer arrive, SKIING down from the hill above. Cobb pulls Eames out of Fischer's earshot. 
COBB You're the dreamer. I need you to draw the security away from the complex. 
EAMES Then who guides Fischer in? You? 
COBB If I know the route... we could be compromised. 
Eames looks as Cobb, uneasy. Ariadne comes over. 
ARIADNE I designed the place. 
COBB No. You're with me. 
SAITO (O.S.) I could do it. 
They turn to Saito. Saito shrugs at Eames. Eames smiles. 
COBB Eames, brief Saito on the route into the complex. What we're looking for is going to be in the most heavily fortified section. That north tower. 
Cobb moves to Fischer. Saito COUGHS. SPITS. Eames sees BLOOD on the snow. Looks at Saito. 
COBB Mr. Fischer, you're going in with Mr. Saito. 
FISCHER You're not coming in? 
COBB You have to do this on your own. You have to get in there, break into your godfather's mind and find out the truth about your father. 
Cobb taps Fischer's radio mike. 
COBB Keep this live at all times. I'll be listening in, covering you. (holds up the sniper rifle) The windows on the upper floors are big enough that I can cover you from that south tower. 
Cobb slips into his skis, shoulders his rifle. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROOM 528 - NIGHT 
Arthur checks the mechanism. He hears LOW BOOMS like thunder. He checks his watch- THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS FORWARDS. With a last look at the sleepers, he heads out into the corridor... 
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY 
A GUNSHOT slams into the van as Yusuf DRIVES- he glances back to see a MOTORCYCLE pulling up behind him, the REAR PASSENGER FIRING A SHOTGUN- the bike pulls alongside Yusuf's window as the passenger RELOADS- Yusuf YANKS the wheel TOWARDS the bike, bringing the shotgun barrel into the cab so he can GRAB it, spin the wheel back- PULLING the passenger from the back of the bike... Yusuf turns a corner, heading into a disused MARKET- 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 
Arthur walks towards the elevator. It OPENS- a SECURITY MAN emerges, heading right for him. Arthur takes a TURN, speeding up. The BOOMS are louder, and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY 
The bike crosses behind the van, catching up again as the driver pulls a handgun and starts BLASTING. Up ahead, an S.U.V. sits in a side road, lining up to head off the van- the SECURITY MAN driving the S.U.V. guns it, as the bike creeps up on the other side of the van- Yusuf HITS THE BRAKES, forcing the bike out into the path of the S.U.V., tossing the rider like a rag doll- 
Heading out of the market, the van races onto a FREEWAY ON RAMP, approaching the BRIDGE. An S.U.V. SMASHES into the van's side, FORCING it up against a CRASH BARRIER... the van starts to SLOWLY TILT OVER THE BARRIER as the S.U.V. PUSHES- 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
As Arthur hurries down the corridor, the corridor starts to TILT, and Arthur is forced to run UP ONTO THE WALL- he rounds a corner- STRAIGHT INTO another Security Man- Arthur HEAD BUTTS him and they STRUGGLE- as they struggle, the corridor SPINS around, THROWING THEM UP ONTO THE WALLS, THE CEILING- as wall becomes floor they DROP through a door into- 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The fight continues all over the spinning room- and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY OFF RAMP NEAR BRIDGE - DAY 
SLEEPING ARTHUR BOUNCES around as the van TILTS, SCRAPING along the barrier- the van CLEARS THE END OF THE BARRIER AND ROLLS DOWN THE EMBANKMENT, and we- 
Cobb turns to her- 
COBB How can you know that? 
INT. ANTECHAMBER - CONTINUOUS 
Fischer moves into the antechamber, cautious- 
FISCHER I'm in. 
Fischer turns up the volume- 
ARIADNE (OVER RADIO) Fischer, look out!- 
Mal DROPS gracefully to the floor behind him- 
MAL Hello. 
INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS 
Cobb looks at Ariadne- 
ARIADNE Cobb, she's just a projection. Fischer... he's real. 
Cobb thinks. Nods, TURNS back to the scope- too late- MAL SHOOTS FISCHER- Cobb reflexively pulls the trigger- Mal GOES DOWN- Cobb steps back from the scope, STUNNED. 
ARIADNE Eames? Get to the anteroom now! 
They run for the door. 
INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS 
Saito STARTS as he hears the shot. He starts edging forwards, clutching his belly. And we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROOM 528 - NIGHT 
The sleepers are floating in a rough stack, top-and-tailed. Arthur pulls the bedding from the bed and uses the sheet to bind the sleepers together. And we- 
CUT TO: 
INT./EXT. VAN - DAY 
In EXTREME SLOW MOTION, the van CREEPS DOWNWARDS, still high above the river... and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Arthur PUSHES the floating stack of sleepers to the elevator. He hits the button- the doors open- he pushes them in- GRABS the charges- climbs through the hatch in the ceiling and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - DAY 
Eames steps over Saito, who looks up at him with DYING eyes- 
INT. ANTECHAMBER, HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 
Eames jumps out of the vent to find Cobb and Ariadne standing over the bodies of Fischer and Mal. 
EAMES What happened? 
ARIADNE Mal killed Fischer- 
COBB I wouldn't shoot her. 
Eames grabs a defibrillator from the wall and pulls Fischer's jacket open- 
COBB It won't do any good- 
Eames SHOCKS Fischer's chest... 
COBB Even if you could revive his body, his mind's trapped down there. It's over. 
Eames listens for a pulse. Looks up at Cobb. 
EAMES So that it, then? We failed. 
COBB I'm sorry. 
EAMES It's you who doesn't get back to your family. 
Eames looks down at Fischer. Then over to the double doors. 
EAMES I wanted to know what was going to happen in there. I think we had this one. 
ARIADNE There's still a way: We follow Fischer down- 
They look at her. 
EAMES We're almost out of time- 
ARIADNE Down there they'll be enough time. We'll find him-soon as you hear Arthur's music start, you use the defibrillator to revive him-we give him his own early kick from below. (MORE) ARIADNE (CONT'D) Get him in there- (points to doors) Then, as the music ends you blow the hospital and we all ride the kick back up through the layers. 
Eames looks at her, then to Cobb. 
EAMES Okay, Saito can hold them off while I plant the rest of the charges. 
COBB Saito's not going to last, Eames. 
ARIADNE We have to try! 
EAMES Go for it, but I'm taking the kick whether you're back or not... 
Eames pulls the mechanism from his pack. Offers it to Ariadne. Cobb watches. Silent. Ariadne pulls out the tubes- 
ARIADNE Can I trust you to do what's needed? Mal's down there- 
COBB And I can find her. She'll have Fischer. 
ARIADNE How do you know? 
COBB She wants me to come after him. She wants me back down there with her. 
Cobb rolls up his sleeve. Ariadne rolls up her own sleeve. Eames NODS. Cobb and Ariadne lie down. Eames hits the button- WATER. BUBBLES. DROWNING. And we are- 
EXT. COAST (LIMBO) - DAY 
COBB I know what's real. 
MAL What are the distinguishing characteristics of a dream? Mutable laws of physics? Tell that to the quantum physicists. Reappearance of the dead? What about heaven and hell? Persecution of the dreamer, the creator, the messiah? They crucified Christ, didn't they? 
COBB I know what's real. 
MAL No creeping doubts? Not feeling persecuted, Dom? Chased around the globe by anonymous corporations and police forces? The way the projections persecute the dreamer? 
Mal puts her hand on his face. Pitying. 
MAL Admit it, Dom. You don't believe in one reality anymore. So choose. Choose your reality like I did. Choose to be here. Choose me. 
COBB (rising anger) I have chosen, Mal. Our children. I have to get back to them. Because you left them. You left us. 
MAL You're wrong, Dom. You're confused... our children are here- 
A child's SHOUT draws Cobb- James CROUCHES on the porch, back to us. Philippa joins him, also turned away. Cobb watches, moved. Mal leans in close. 
MAL (whispers) And you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you, Dom? 
COBB Our real children are waiting for me up above. 
And we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT 
Arthur scrambles to arrange the sleepers on the floor of the car- as his hand comes away from Saito, he sees BLOOD on it. He looks at Saito's belly- the blood is coming through his shirt. Arthur sticks headphones on sleeping Eames, and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL FORTRESS - DAY 
Eames throws a GRENADE, blowing up the security forces trying to ascend the terraces. He DUCKS to the ground to avoid HEAVY FIRE- starts unpacking the charges and setting them along the base of the terraces- 
INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS 
Saito looks up as he hears a Security Guard climbing through the duct... he raises his gun, TREMBLING with weakness... And we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. KITCHEN, PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY 
Mal laughs at Cobb. 
MAL (laughs) Up above? Listen to yourself. You judged me for believing the very same thing. 
Mal points at the children- 
MAL These are our children. Watch. (turns to the kids) Hey, James! Philippa?! 
The children START TO TURN to us- BUT COBB CLOSES HIS EYES. 
COBB They're not real, Mal. Our real children are waiting for us- 
The children run off. Cobb opens his eyes. 
MAL You keep telling yourself that but you don't believe it- 
COBB I know it- 
MAL And what if you're wrong? What if I'm what's real? 
Cobb is silent. 
MAL You keep telling yourself what you know... but what do you believe? What do you feel? 
Cobb looks at Mal. Struggling. 
COBB Guilt. I feel guilt. And however confused I might get. (MORE) COBB (CONT'D) However lost I might seem... it's always there. Telling me something. Reminding me of the truth. 
MAL What truth? 
COBB That you were wrong to doubt our world. That the idea that drove you to question your reality was a lie... 
MAL How could you know it was a lie? 
COBB Because it was my lie. 
MAL (realizing) Because you planted the idea in my mind. 
COBB Because I performed inception on my own wife, then reaped the bitter rewards... 
ARIADNE Why? 
COBB We'd become lost in here. Living in a world of infinite possibilities. A world where we were gods. I realized we needed to escape, but she'd locked away her knowledge of the unreality of this world... 
INSERT CUT: Mal opens the doll's house. Takes the spinning top, lies it down in the safe. LOCKS IT AWAY. 
COBB I couldn't make Mal understand that we needed to break free. To die. So I started to search our world... 
Cobb turns to Mal, but keeps talking to Ariadne... 
INSERT CUT: Cobb WANDERS the streets of Limbo... 
COBB Searching for the right place in her mind... 
INSERT CUT: Cobb stops outside the VICTORIAN HOUSE, MAL'S CHILDHOOD HOME, looking up at it. He heads inside... 
COBB And when I found that place, that secret place where she had shut away her knowledge years before, I broke it open... 
INSERT CUT: Cobb looks around Mal's childhood bedroom. Comes to the doll's house... 
COBB I broke into the deepest recess of her mind, to give her the simplest little idea. 
INSERT CUT: Cobb throws open the safe doors. Sitting on the shelf of the safe is a spinning top. On its side. 
COBB A truth that she had once known, but had chosen to forget... 
INSERT CUT: Cobb picks up the totem. He SPINS it in the safe. IT SPINS AND SPINS WITHOUT END. Cobb CLOSES THE DOOR of the safe... 
COBB That her world was not real. 
INSERT CUT: COBB AND MAL ARRIVE AT TRAIN TRACKS CUTTING THROUGH WASTELAND. 
COBB (V.O.) That death was a necessary escape. 
They lie on the tracks looking into each other's eyes. Mal is crying. Cobb takes her hand, reassuring. He starts to speak-

__________________________________________SCENE 
MR. INCREDIBLE 
Is this on? 
INTERVIEWER 
That's fine. 
MR. INCREDIBLE 
I can break through walls, I just can't... 
INTERVIEWER 
That's fine. 
MR. INCREDIBLE 
I can't get this on. 
INTERVIEWER 
So, Mr. Incredible...do you have a secret identity? 
MR. INCREDIBLE 
Every superhero has a secret identity. I don't know a single one who doesn't. Who wants the pressure of being super all the time? 
ELASTIGIRL 
Of course I have a secret identity. Can you see me in this at the supermarket? Come on. Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl, y'know what I mean? 
FROZONE 
Superladies, they're always trying to tell you their secret identity. Think it'll strengthen the relationship or something like that. I said, ''Girl, I don't want to know about your mild-mannered alter ego.'' or anything like that. I mean, you tell me you're a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe, that's all right with me. I'm good. I'm good. 
MR. INCREDIBLE 
No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to stay saved, you know? For a little bit. I feel like the maid. ''I just cleaned up this mess. Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?'' 
INTERVIEWER 
I could get to that point. 
MR. INCREDIBLE 
''Please?'' 
INTERVIEWER 
Wait, no, don't get up. We're not finished. 
MR. INCREDIBLE 
Sometimes l think I'd just like the simple life, you know? Relax a little and raise a family. 
ELASTIGIRL 
Settle down? Are you kidding? I'm at the top of my game! I'm right up there with the big dogs! Girls, come on. Leave the saving of the world to the men? I don't think so. I don't think so. 
__________________________________________SCENE 
POLICE RADIO 
We interrupt for an important bulletin. A deadly high-speed pursuit between police and armed gunmen is underway, traveling northbound on San Pablo Ave. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Yeah, I've got time. 
OLD LADY 
Mr. lncredible. Um, Mr. Incredible... 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
What is it, ma'am? 
OLD LADY 
My cat, Squeaker, won't come down. 
[cat meows] 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Certainly, ma'am but I suggest you stand clear. There could be trouble. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Thanks, but I don't need any help. 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Whatever happened to ''ladies first''? 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Well, whatever happened to equal treatment? 
THIEF 
Hey, look, the lady got me first. 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Well, we could share, you know. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
I work alone. 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Well, I think you need to be more...flexible. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Are you doing anything later? 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
I have a previous engagement. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
[whistles] 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Now, you just stay here. They usually pick up the garbage in an hour. 
LUCIUS (FROZONE) 
Hey, lncredible! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Hey, Frozone! 
LUCIUS (FROZONE) 
Shouldn't you be getting ready? 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
I still got time. 
[crowd screaming] 
WOMAN 
He's gonna jump! 
SANSWEET 
I think you broke something. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
With counseling, I think you'll come to forgive me. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Wait a minute. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
[coughing] Bomb Voyage. 
VOYAGE 
[French] Mr. Incredible! 
BUDDY (INCREDIBOY) 
And lncrediBoy! 
VOYAGE 
lncrediBoy? 
BUDDY (INCREDIBOY) 
Hey, hey! Aren't you curious about how I get around so fast? See? I have these rocket boots-- 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Go home, Buddy. 
BUDDY (INCREDIBOY) 
__________________________________________SCENE 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Is the night still young? 
LUCIUS (FROZONE) 
You're very late. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
How do I look? Good? 
LUCIUS (FROZONE) 
Oh, the mask! You still got the mask. 
[cracks neck] 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Showtime. 
PRIEST 
Robert Parr, will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife? 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
You're late. When you asked me if I was doing anything later, I didn't realize you'd actually forgotten. I thought it was playful banter. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
It was playful banter. 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Cutting it kinda close, don't you think? 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
You need to be more... flexible. 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
I love you, but if we're gonna make this work, you've gotta be more than Mr. lncredible. You know that. Don't you? 
PRIEST 
...so long as you both shall live? 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
I do. 
PRIEST 
I pronounce this couple husband and wife. 
[people cheering and whistling] 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
As long as we both shall live. No matter what happens. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Hey, come on. We're superheroes. What could happen? 
ANNOUNCER 
In a stunning turn of events, a superhero is being sued for saving someone who, apparently, didn't want to be saved. The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet, who was foiled in his attempted suicide by Mr. Incredible, has filed suit against the famed superhero in Superior Court. 
SANSWEET'S LAWYER 
Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved. Mr. Sansweet didn't want to be saved. And the injury received from Mr. Incredible ''actions'', so quote, causes him daily pain. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Hey, I saved your life! 
SANSWEET 
You didn't save my life! You ruined my death, that's what you did! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Listen-- 
MR. INCREDIBLE'S LAWYER 
My client has no further comment at this time. 
ANNOUNCER 
Five days later, another suit was filed by victims of the el train accident. Incredible's court losses cost the government millions. And opened the flood gates for dozens of superhero lawsuits the world over. 
WOMAN 
It is time for their secret identity to become their only identity. Time for them to join us, or go away. 
ANNOUNCER 
HELEN 
You saw him do this? 
BERNIE 
Well...not really. No. Actually, not. 
HELEN 
Oh, then how do you know it was him? 
BERNIE 
I hid a camera. Yeah, and this time, I've got him. See? You see? You don't see it? He moves! Right there! Wait, wait! Right there! Right as I'm sitting down! I don't know how he does it, but there's no tack before he moves and after he moves, there's a tack. Coincidence? I think not! 
PRINCIPAL 
Bernie... 
BERNIE 
Don't ''Bernie'' me. [screaming] This little rat is guilty! 
PRINCIPAL 
You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr. I'm sorry for the trouble. 
BERNIE 
You're letting him go again? He's guilty! You can see it on his smug little face. Guilty, I say, guilty! 
HELEN 
Dash, this is the third time this year you've been sent to the office. We need to find a better outlet. A more...constructive outlet. 
DASH 
Maybe I could, if you'd let me go out for sports. 
HELEN 
Honey, you know why we can't do that. 
DASH 
I promise I'll slow up. I'll only be the best by a tiny bit. 
HELEN 
Dashiell Robert Parr, you are an incredibly competitive boy. And a bit of a showoff. The last thing you need is temptation. 
DASH 
You always say, ''Do your best.'' But you don't really mean it. Why can't I do the best that I can do? 
HELEN 
Right now, honey, the world just wants us to fit in, and to fit in, we just gotta be like everybody else. 
DASH 
Dad always said our powers were nothing to be ashamed of. Our powers made us special. 
HELEN 
Everyone's special, Dash. 
DASH 
Which is another way of saying no one is. 
BOY 
Hey, Rydinger. Where you headed? 
GIRL 
Hi, Tony. 
TONY 
Hey. 
BOY 
Hey, Tony, can I carry your books? 
TONY 
That's kind of funny. 
BOY 1 
Hey, Tony, do you play football? 
BOY 2 
Tony, I thought we were gonna go swimming. 
VIOLET 
He looked at me. 
Honey! 
BOB 
Great. First the car, now I gotta pay to fix the table... 
HELEN 
The car? What happened to the car? 
BOB 
Here. I'm getting a new plate. 
HELEN 
So, how about you, Vi? How was school? 
VIOLET 
Nothing to report. 
HELEN 
You've hardly touched your food. 
VIOLET 
I'm not hungry for meatloaf. 
HELEN 
Well, it is leftover night. We have steak, pasta. What are you hungry for? 
DASH 
Tony Rydinger. 
VIOLET 
Shut up! 
DASH 
Well, you are. 
VIOLET 
I said, shut up, you little insect! 
DASH 
Well, she is. 
HELEN 
Do not shout at the table. Honey! 
BOB 
Kids! Listen to your mother. 
DASH 
She'd eat if we were having Tony loaf. 
VIOLET 
That's it! 
HELEN 
Stop it! 
DASH 
You're gonna be toast! 
HELEN 
Stop running in the house. Sit down! 
DASH 
Ow! Hey, no force fields! 
VIOLET 
You started it. 
HELEN 
You sit down! You sit down! Violet! 
BOB 
''Simon J. Paladino, longtime advocate of superhero rights, is missing''? Gazerbeam. 
HELEN 
Bob! It's time to engage. Do something! Don't just stand there! I need you to intervene! 
BOB 
He starts monologuing. 
LUCIUS 
He starts monologuing! He starts like this prepared speech about how feeble I am compared to him. How inevitable my defeat is, how the world will soon be his! Yada, yada, yada. 
BOB 
Yammering. 
LUCIUS 
Yammering! I mean, the guy has me on a platter, and he won't shut up. 
POLICE RADIO 
Municiberg, we have a 23-56... 
BOB 
23-56, what is that? Robbery? 
LUCIUS 
This is just sad. 
BOB 
Yeah, robbery. Want to catch a robber? 
LUCIUS 
No. Tell you the truth, I'd rather go bowling. Look, what if we actually did what our wives think we're doing? Just to shake things up. 
WOMAN 
He's not alone. The fat guy's still with him. They're just talking. 
LUCIUS 
What are we doing here, Bob? 
BOB 
Protecting people. 
LUCIUS 
Nobody asked us. 
BOB 
You need an invitation? 
LUCIUS 
I'd like one, yes. We keep sneaking out to do this, and...you remember Gazerbeam? 
BOB 
Yeah. There was something about him in the paper. 
LUCIUS 
He had trouble adjusting to civilian life, too. 
BOB 
When's the last time you saw him? 
LUCIUS 
I don't see anyone from the old days, Bob. Just you. And we're pushing our luck as it is. 
BOB 
Oh, come on. 
LUCIUS 
It was fun the first time, but if we keep doing this, we're gonna get-- 
POLICE RADIO 
We have a report on a fire... 
BOB 
A fire. We're close! [yelling] Yeah, baby! 
LUCIUS 
We're gonna get caught. 
BOB 
Woohoo! Haha!  Fire! Yeah! 
LUCIUS 
Is that everybody? 
BOB 
Did I do something illegal? 
MR. HUPH 
No. 
BOB 
Are you saying we shouldn't help our customers? 
MR. HUPH 
The law requires that I answer no. 
BOB 
We're supposed to help people. 
MR. HUPH 
We're supposed to help our people! Starting with our stockholders, Bob. Who's helping them out, huh? You know, Bob, a company... 
BOB 
Is like an enormous clock. 
MR. HUPH 
...is like an enormous clo--yes. Precisely. It only works if all the little cogs mesh together. Now, a clock needs to be cleaned, well-lubricated and wound tight. The best clocks have jewel movements, cogs that fit, that cooperate by design. [chuckling] I'm being metaphorical, Bob. You know what I mean by cooperative cogs? Bob? Bob? Look at me when I'm talking to you, Parr! 
BOB 
That man out there, he needs help. 
MR. HUPH 
Do not change the subject, Bob. We're discussing your attitude! 
BOB 
He is getting mugged! 
MR. HUPH 
Well, let's hope we don't cover him. 
BOB 
I'll be right back. 
MR. HUPH 
Stop right now or you're fired! Close the door. Get over here, now. 
MR. HUPH 
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy. 
BOB 
He got away. 
MR. HUPH 
Good thing, too. You were this close to losing your jo-- 
BOB 
Uh-oh.

BOB 
How is he? 
RICK 
He'll live. 
BOB 
I'm fired, aren't I? 
RICK 
Oh, you think? 
BOB 
What can I say, Rick? 
RICK 
Nothing you haven't said before. 
BOB 
Someone was in trouble. 
RICK 
Someone's always in trouble. 
BOB 
Uh-oh.

HELEN 
You are one distracted guy. 
BOB 
Hmm? Am I? I don't mean to be. 
HELEN 
I know you miss being a hero and your job is frustrating. I just want you to know how much it means to me that you stay at it anyway. 
BOB 
Honey? About the job? 
HELEN 
What? 
BOB 
Something's happened. 
HELEN 
What? 
BOB 
The, uh... 
HELEN 
What? 
BOB 
The company is sending me to, uh, a conference. 
HELEN 
A conference? 
BOB 
[stammering] Out of town. And I'm just gonna be gone for a few days. 
HELEN 
They've never sent you to a conference before. This is good, isn't it? 
BOB 
[hesitating] Yes. 
HELEN 
You see? They're finally recognizing your talents. You're moving up. 
BOB 
Yes. 
HELEN 
Honey! This is wonderful! 
BOB 
Yes, it is. 
[phone ringing] 
MIRAGE [over phone] 
Hello? 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
This is Mr. lncredible. I'm in.

MIRAGE 
The Omnidroid 9000 is a top secret prototype battle robot. lts artificial intelligence enables it to solve any problem it's confronted with. And, unfortunately... 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Let me guess. It got smart enough to wonder why it had to take orders. 
MIRAGE 
We lost control. And now it's loose in the jungle, threatening our facility. We've had to evacuate all personnel from the island for their own safety. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
I prefer to think of it as misunderstood. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
[chuckling] Aren't we all? 
MIRAGE 
Volcanic soil is among the most fertile on Earth. Everything at the table was grown right here. How does it compare? 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Everything's delicious. 
__________________________________________SCENE 
BOB 
Jeez. 
HELEN 
Hurry, honey. Or you'll be late for work. 
HELEN 
Have a great day, honey. 
BOB 
Thanks. 
HELEN 
Help customers, climb ladders... 
BOB 
Bring bacon? 
HELEN 
All that jazz. 
GUARD 
You have an appointment? 
BOB 
I'm an old friend. I just wanted to... 
GUARD 
All visitors are required to make a reser-- 
E 
[shoos the guard away] Get back to work! Go check the electric fence or something! What is it? Who are you? What do you want? 
E 
My God, you've gotten fat. Come in. Come, come. 
E 
Yes, things are going quite well. Quite well. My God, no complaints. But, you know, it is not the same. Not the same at all. 
BOB 
Weren't you just in the news? Some show in Prayge... Prague? 
E 
Milan, darling. Milan. Supermodels. Ha! Nothing super about them. Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures with poofy lips who think only about themselves. Feh! I used to design for gods. But perhaps you come with a challenge, eh? I was surprised to get your call. 
BOB 
E, I just need a patch job. 
E 
Hmm. This is megamesh. Outmoded, but very sturdy. And you've torn right through it! What have you been doing, Robert? Moonlighting hero work? 
BOB 
Must have happened a long time ago. 
E 
I see. This is a hobo suit, darling. You can't be seen in this. I won't allow it! Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now? 
BOB 
What do you mean? You designed it. 
E 
I never look back, darling. It distracts from the now. You need a new suit. That much is certain. 
BOB 
A new suit? Where the heck am I gonna get a new suit? 
MIRAGE 
See you there. 
BOB 
Goodbye. 
HELEN 
Who was that, honey? The, uh, office? 
BOB 
Another conference. Short notice, but you know...duty calls. [nervous laugh] 
HELEN 
Bob? 
BOB 
Yeah, what's up, honey? 
HELEN 
Ha... have a great trip. 
BOB 
Thanks, sweetie. I'll call you when I get there. 
HELEN 
I love you. So much. 
BOB 
I love you too. 
COMPUTER 
This is your automated Captain. Would you care for more mimosa? 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Don't mind if I do. Thanks. 
COMPUTER 
You're welcome. 
COMPUTER 
Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan. Perfect weather for flying. 
COMPUTER 
Please fasten your seat belt. We're beginning our descent. 
MIRAGE 
Hello, Mr. lncredible. Nice suit. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Thanks. Nice to be back, Mirage. 
MIRAGE 
You'll be briefed on your assignment in the conference room at two. D Wing, room A-113. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
2:00. Got it. 
MIRAGE 
See you there. 
HELEN 
[gasps] Edna. 
__________________________________________SCENE 
HELEN 
I'd like to speak to Edna, please. 
E 
This is Edna. 
HELEN 
E? This is Helen. 
E 
Helen who? 
HELEN 
Yes, words are useless. Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble! Too much of it, darling. Too much! That is why I show you my work. That is why you are here. 
E 
Edna Mode. And guest. 
E 
Come. Sit. 
E 
Cream and sugar? 
HELEN 
Thanks. 
E 
I started with the baby. 
HELEN 
Started? 
E 
Shh! Darling! Shh! I cut it a little roomy for the free movement. The fabric is comfortable for sensitive skin, and can also withstand a temperature of over 1000 degrees. Completely bulletproof. And machine washable, darling. That's a new feature. 
HELEN 
What on earth do you think the baby will be doing?! 
E 
Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling. Luck favors the prepared. I didn't know the baby's powers, so I covered the basics. 
HELEN 
Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers. 
E 
No? Well, he'll look fabulous anyway. 
E 
Your boy's suit I designed to withstand enormous friction without heating up or wearing out. A useful feature. 
E 
Your daughter's suit was tricky. But I finally created a sturdy material that will disappear completely as she does. 
E 
Your suit can stretch as far as you can, without injuring yourself, and still retain its shape. Virtually indestructible...yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton. As an extra feature, each suit contains a homing device, giving you the precise global location of the wearer at the touch of a button. Well, darling? What do you think? 
HELEN 
What do I think? Bob is retired! I'm retired! Our family is underground. You helped my husband resume secret hero work behind my back?! 
E 
Well, I assumed you knew, darling. Why would he keep secrets from you? 
HELEN 
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't. 
E 
Men at Robert's age are often unstable. Prone to weakness. 
HELEN 
What are you saying? 
E 
Do you know where he is? 
HELEN 
Of course. 
E 
Do you know where he is?

Hey, hey. We got a man down! 
HELEN 
Hey, Snug. Thanks for getting back. I know this is short notice, but I was hoping that I could get you to... 
VIOLET 
What are these? 
DASH 
Look, I'm The Dash! The Dash likes. 
HELEN 
Just a second. Take that off before somebody sees it. 
VIOLET 
But you're packing one just like it. Are you hiding something? 
HELEN 
Oh, please, honey. I'm on the phone...Dash! 
DASH 
Yikes! This is yours. It's specially made. 
VIOLET 
What's going on? 
HELEN 
You're not coming! And I've gotta pack! 
VIOLET 
What makes you think it's special? 
DASH 
I don't know. Why'd Mom try to hide it? 
HELEN 
Snug, I'm calling in a solid you owe me. 
SNUG [over phone] 
What do you need? 
HELEN 
A jet. What do you got that's fast? 
SNUG 
Let me think...

HELEN 
Island tower, this is India Golf niner-niner requesting vectors to the initial. Over. 
[radio static] 
HELEN 
Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl. You're overreacting. Everything's fine. They're just all getting coffee. At the same time. Yeah. 
SYNDROME 
You sir, truly are ''Mr. lncredible''! You know, I was right to idolize you. I always knew you were tough, but tricking the probe by hiding under the bones of another super? Oh, man! I'm still geeking out about it! [sighs] And then you had to just go and ruin the ride. I mean, Mr. lncredible calling for help? [mocking] ''Help me, help me.'' Lame, lame, lame, lame, lame! All right, who did you contact?! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Contact? What are you talking about? 
SYNDROME 
I am referring to last night at 2307 hours while you were snooping around. You sent out a homing signal. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
I didn't know about the homing device. 
SYNDROME 
And now a government plane is requesting permission to land here! Who did you contact?! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
I didn't send for a plane. 
SYNDROME 
VIOLET 
But you said we weren't supposed to use our powers. 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
I know what I said! Listen to what I'm saying now! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Disengage. Repeat, disengage! 
DASH 
Mom? 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Violet! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Mayday, mayday! India Golf niner-niner is buddy-spiked! Abort! Abort! There are children aboard, say again, there are children aboard! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
No! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
[to Violet] Put a field around us now! 
VIOLET 
I've never done one that big! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Violet, do it now! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Abort, abort, abort! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Abort, abort, abort! 
[all screaming] 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Brace yourselves! 
VIOLET/DASH 
Mom! Mom! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Everybody calm down. Now, I'll tell you what we're not gonna do. We're not gonna panic, we're not gonna--look out! 
DASH/VIOLET 
- Oh, my God! Who's idea was this anyway?! 
- What are we gonna do?! What are we gonna do?! 
DASH 
We're dead! We're dead! 
VIOLET 
It blew up! 
DASH 
We survived but we're dead! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Stop it! We are not gonna die! Now both of you will get a grip. Or so help me I will ground you for a month! Understand? 
MIRAGE 
We have a confirmed hit. Target was destroyed. 
SYNDROME 
Ah, you'll get over it. I seem to recall you prefer to ''work alone''. [evil laughter] 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Release me...now! 
SYNDROME 
Or what? 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
I'll crush her. 
Mom! Mom, what happened on the plane. I'm sorry. [stammering] I wanted to help. I mean, when you asked me to... I'm sorry. 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Shh. It isn't your fault. It wasn't fair for me to suddenly ask so much of you. But things are different now. And doubt is a luxury we can't afford anymore, sweetie. You have more power than you realize. Don't think. And don't worry. lf the time comes, you'll know what to do. It's in your blood. 
MIRAGE 
He's not weak, you know. 
SYNDROME 
What? 
MIRAGE 
Valuing life is not weakness. 
SYNDROME 
Oh, hey. Look, look...if you're talking about what happened in the containment unit, I had everything under control. 
MIRAGE 
And disregarding it is not strength. 
SYNDROME 
I called his bluff, sweetheart, that's all. I knew he wouldn't have it in him to actually... 
MIRAGE 
Next time you gamble, bet your own life! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Okay, okay, okay. 
[voices on radio] 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
A rocket? 
[sighs, gasps] 
GUARD 
Hey! 
[struggling] 
DASH 
Well, not that this isn't fun, but I'm gonna go look around. 
VIOLET 
What do you think is going on here? You think we're on vacation or something? Mom and Dad's lives could be in jeopardy. Or worse, [whispering] their marriage. 
DASH 
Their marriage? So, the bad guys are trying to wreck Mom and Dad's marriage. 
VIOLET 
Oh, forget it. You're so immature. 
DASH 
Okay, I'm gonna go look around. 
VIOLET 
Mom said to stay hidden. 
DASH 
I'm not gonna leave the cave. Sheesh! 
[voices over radio] 
DASH 
[echoing] Cool! 
DASH 
[echoing] Cool! 
[over radio] Roger. We are ready for launch.

Vi, Vi! 
VIOLET 
What did you do? 
[over radio] ETA two-niner. Over. TCI clear. Condition yellow. Status norm. 
[over radio] Not responding to IFF. IRCM reads negative. 
Huh? Huh? Oh, come on! You gotta admit, this is cool. Just like a movie! The robot will emerge dramatically, do some damage. Throngs of screaming people! And just when all hope is lost, Syndrome will save the day! I'll be a bigger hero than you ever were! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
You mean you killed off real heroes so that you could pretend to be one? 
SYNDROME 
Oh, I'm real. Real enough to defeat you! And I did it without your precious gifts, your oh-so-special powers. I'll give them heroics. I'll give them the most spectacular heroics anyone's ever seen! And when I'm old and I've had my fun, I'll sell my inventions so that everyone can be superheroes. Everyone can be super. And when everyone's super...no one will be. [evil laughter] 
[soldiers shouting] 
SOLDIER 
Fire at will! 
- [on TV] It's completely overwhelming the tanks. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
I'm sorry. This is my fault. I've been a lousy father. Blind to what I have. So obsessed with being undervalued that I undervalued all of you. 
DASH 
Um..dad? 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Shh. Don't interrupt. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
So caught up in the past that I...You are my greatest adventure. And I almost missed it. I swear, I'm gonna get us out of this safely if I... 
VIOLET 
Well, I think Dad has made some excellent progress today but I think it's time we wind down now. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
We need to get back to the mainland. 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in. Straight ahead, I think. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Where are all the guards? 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Go, go! 
GUARD 
Hey, look. Hey! Every time they run, you take a shot. 
GUARD 2 
Yeah, okay. 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
This is the right hangar, but I don't see any jets. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
A jet's not fast enough. 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
What's faster than a jet? 
DASH 
Hey, how about a rocket? 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Great! I can't fly a rocket. 
VIOLET 
You don't have to. Use the coordinates from the last launch. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Wait. I bet Syndrome's changed the password by now. How do I get into the computer? 
MIRAGE 
Say please.

Honey? 
HONEY 
What? 
DASH 
Got it! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Honey, take out its guns! 
LUCIUS (FROZONE) 
Dash! Gotcha! 
VIOLET 
Mom, I've got it! I've got the remote! 
LUCIUS (FROZONE) 
A remote? A remote that controls what? The robot? 
DASH 
It's coming back! 
DASH 
That wasn't right. 
VIOLET 
Give me that! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
We can't stop it. The only thing hard enough to penetrate it is...itself. 
DASH 
It's getting closer! 
VIOLET 
It doesn't work! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Kids! 
LUCIUS (FROZONE) 
It's not doing anything! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Lucius, try to buy us some time! 
LUCIUS (FROZONE) 
Try the one next to it! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Honey! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Wait a minute. Press that button again! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
No, the other one! The first one! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
First button! Got it! 
DASH 
It's getting closer! 
LUCIUS (FROZONE) 
Look out! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Get out of here, kids! Find a safe spot! 
VIOLET 
We're not going anywhere! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Press the button! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Not yet! 
LUCIUS (FROZONE) 
Hang on! 
[Kari] 
- I'm not fine, Mrs. Parr! Put that down! Stop it! You need to call me. I need help, Mrs. Parr! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Bob, listen to this. 
[Kari] 
- I'm gonna call the police... 
- Hi, this is Kari. Sorry for freaking out, but your baby has special needs. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
"Special needs"? 
RICK 
Here we are. 
[Kari] 
- Anyway, thanks for sending a replacement sitter. 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Replacement? I didn't call a replacement. 
SYNDROME 
Shh. The baby is sleeping. You took away my future. I'm simply returning the favor. Oh, don't worry, I'll be a good mentor. Supportive, encouraging. Everything you weren't. And in time, who knows, he might make a good sidekick. Ha ha! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
He's getting away, Bob! We have to do something! We have to do something now! 
[Jack-Jack cries] 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Something's happening. What's happening?! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
We have to stop him! Throw something! 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
I can't! I might hit Jack-Jack! 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Throw me. 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Bob, throw me! 
[Jack-Jack cooing] 
SYNDROME 
No! 
SYNDROME 
This isn't the end of it! I will get your son, eventually. I'll get your son! 
SYNDROME 
Oh, no. 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
Look at Mommy, honey. Don't look down. Mommy's got you. Everything is all right. 
HELEN (ELASTIGIRL) 
That's my girl. 
DASH 
Does this mean we have to move again? 
KID 
Oh, man. That was totally wicked!

Do we have to have cheerleaders at the track meet? I mean, what is that all about?

Well, I always thought it was more like a...

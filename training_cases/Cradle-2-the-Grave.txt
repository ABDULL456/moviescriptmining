FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY 
FADE IN: 
EXT. STREETS (LOS ANGELES) - DAY 
End of the day.     An armored truck moves through the city of Los Angeles. 
EXT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAY The armored truck pulls up. An ARMORED TRUCK GUARD emerges from the back with a satchel and heads inside. 
INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION A large foyer. Security station and elevators. PARTY SOUNDS can be heard from a second floor balcony. DOUGLAS is the security guard manning the station. Seeing the Armored car Guard entering, he picks up the phone and dials. Beat. Into phone -- DOUGLAS Last delivery's finally here. The Armored Truck Guard approaches the security station. As he and Douglas exchange paperwork, the Armored Truck Guard references the sounds from upstairs -- ARMORED TRUCK GUARD Party? DOUGLAS Introducing a new line of jewelry. ARMORED TRUCK GUARD Wife wants me to buy her a ruby ring. Told her to spend a little time with the family jewels first. PING. An ELEVATOR opens. A second security guard's inside. Handing over the satchel and heading out -- ARMORED TRUCK GUARD Keep it real. 
INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY Fait and Miles reach an access door tagged with paint.    Fait starts to open it. Suddenly, the tunnel is filled with the ROAR of an APPROACHING TRAIN. Fait and Miles leap to the wall.   Press their backs against it as tightly as they can. The TRAIN whooms past, inches from their faces. When it's gone, Miles sighs with relief. Fait cracks the access door. 
INT. SUBWAY UTILITY TUNNELS - DAY Fait moves quickly, Miles following. Fait makes fast lefts and rights, following more spray paint. They branch off into a small dirt-floored space, deep in the sub-foundation of a building. Fait stops. Overhead is a flat ceiling. On the ceiling, his flashlight finds a spray- painted circle. FAIT Bull's-eye. Without a word, Miles begins assembling equipment.    Fait pulls out a cell phone. 
EXT. PARKING GARAGE - (SANTA MONICA) ROOFTOP - DAY 
A man, DUNCAN SU, sits in a rental 2002 Thunderbird. 
INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Su's focused, intense, listening to a fancy WALKMAN through HEADPHONES. We hear what he hears. Only there's no music, just STATIC. Suddenly, on Su's headphones, a PHONE RINGS. Su grows even more alert. We hear a man with a French accent answer the phone. CHRISTOPHE (V.O.) Yes? 
FAIT (V.O.) We're in position. CHRISTOPHE (V.O.) Delivery confirmed. The stones are there. FAIT (V.O.) Not for long. CLICK.   HISS. Su didn't like what he just heard.       Curses in Chinese.   And takes off. 
EXT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY Perched on the side of a cliff above the Pacific, next to the park. The top floor is at street level. Su easily gains access to the roof of the building. He moves to an exact position just at the ocean-side edge. It's an eight-story drop. Su faces in.      And then... Hops backward off the roof. Falling feet-first through the air, Su momentarily grabs onto an eight-floor balcony rail, slowing his descent, then lets go. Momentarily grabs a seventh-floor rail and lets go. Grabs a sixth-floor rail. Hangs on this time. Vaults lightly onto the balcony. 
INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
A large, free-standing FISH TANK BUBBLES away. Nearby, CHRISTOPHE is packing to leave town. When... SU (0.S.) Where are the stones? 
DARIA'S POV The magazine is Genre.   Males for males.   Buff boys.   Big pecs, big penises. 
BACK TO SCENE Daria steps back. DARIA Well, I suppose I should go up and see what they're selling. Daria turns back and calls to her chauffeur, TOMMY. DARIA Tommy... What happens next happens very quickly and sotto voce, as Daria walks toward Tommy: She whispers into a hidden mike -- DARIA Change of plans. He's gay. Tommy hears it over his earwig. TOMMY No way. DARIA Yeah way. INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY Fait and Miles have heard it, too.   Into his mike -- FAIT Tommy.    Your turn. 
A look of alarm on Tommy's face.    Into his mike -- TOMMY Uh-uh. 
FAIT This isn't a conversation.    Do it. It's an order.    Tommy knows he has to.   Shit. TOMMY Shit. DARIA Key-card. 
Then, still to Tommy, her voice again at normal volume -- DARIA Why don't you keep my purse?     I shouldn't be too long. Daria hands Tommy her purse. Palms the key-card from him. Then heads toward the elevator, as... Tommy replaces the sick look on his face. Does his best to look flirty as he walks over to the security station. Leans over the desk with a yummy-smile on his face. TOMMY ... Aloha. (NOTE: The following scene is INTERCUT with Scenes 20 thru 28.) Douglas looks up from his magazine. DOUGLAS Hi. TOMMY I hope you don't take offense at this... but I just have such a weakness for a man in uniform. DOUGLAS If that's your thing... TOMMY Uniform's definitely my thing. I mean, I see a sailor, I'm thinking, mmm, seafood. Y'know? DOUGLAS I'm not actually supposed to be 
talking on duty. TOMMY Who's talking? Honey, this is a flirting... But you're probably just another good-looking man wasting it all on women. World's full of fools. Beat.   Douglas lets him see the Genre magazine. TOMMY Yahtzee!... Okay, Mr. I-Always-Have- A-Hard-Nightstick. Put away the pictures of those underfed, white males and let's broaden your horizons. 
TOMMY (CONT'D) I like sunsets and puppy dogs, and I'm big in the pants. Just hope I'm not too cute for you. And don't tell me it's a color thing, hon, or I'll come over there and slap a little discrimination right upside your yummy little cheeks. DOUGLAS I'm hooked up. TOMMY Another big, hot, cuddly, black love- Jesus got there first. That bitch. Taking you. From me. DOUGLAS Sorry. TOMMY Hey... This day and age, sweetie, I can appreciate the monogamy. Saving it for your number one is keeping the world safe, and it's okay by me. Even if you are just breaking my heart... Guess I'll just have to come in here someday, let you catch me shoplifting and resist arrest -- just to have you wrestle me down and cuff me. DOUGLAS I can be pretty rough. TOMMY Don't you get me all excited now.   I was just learning to accept my disappointment. 
Tommy sticks out his hand. TOMMY Tommy.     But you can call me Rachel. 
Shaking hands -- DOUGLAS Douglas. And, man, I really gotta get back to what I'm supposed to be doing, okay? He looks away.     Scans the monitors. 
INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY On the anteroom monitor, we see the monitor on Fait's camera slide into position, making the room look empty, as Tommy continues diverting Douglas's attention. 
INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY Fait and Daria push the display table aside as Miles shoves equipment bags through the hole in the floor. Fait opens the leather bag, revealing tools, a tripod, three steel cables and a long, rectangular box. Miles grabs a high-tech DRILL. Begins BORING a hole high up on the vault door. Fait hands Daria the tripod to set up, while he uncoils the steel cables, attaches them to the wheel on the vault door. Then opens the rectangular box and lifts out what's inside. A surface-to-air missile. Fait sets it on the tripod. 
Miles, the hole drilled, picks up the cylinder he'd had slung over his shoulder. Pulls out a pressurized metal canister of liquid nitrogen. Miles injects the nitrogen into the hole. A CRACKLING sound as the super-low-temp LIQUID spreads out inside the vault door. The outside frosts over. Fait finishes attaching the free ends of the cables to clips on the SAM. Final checks of the rig. FAIT Out. 
INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAY 
Speeding through L.A.   Calling 911 on a cell phone. SU ... I want to report a crime in progress. 
INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY Fait is the last one down through the hole.   Beat.    He looks at the others. FAIT Faith. MILES Faith. DARIA Faith. Fait pulls out a remote control firing device.   He pushes the button. And... 
INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY The SAM IGNITES with a blinding flash and streaks across the room. The steel cables instantly snap taut and... RIP the vault's wheel and frozen locking mechanism right the fuck out of the door. 
INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY They felt a rumble.   Tommy covers -- TOMMY Earthquake. 
Douglas checks the monitors.      Everything looks okay. TOMMY Bet you know how to hit a ten on the Richter scale... 
INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY The crew re-emerges through the floor to find the vault door in pieces and a hole the size of a Sub Zero where the SAM augured into the opposite wall. DARIA Holy shit... 
INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAY 
Su studies a computer map of downtown as he drives. 
INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MILES - DAY running like hell. Rounds a curve.      Ahead are the rear lights of a stopped train. 
INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - FAIT AND DARIA - DAY Approaching the front of another train, stopped at a station. Fait signals Daria to stay put. Then pokes his head around the corner of the train. 
FAIT'S POV - STATION PLATFORM SWAT cops hustle passengers off the train. One SWAT GUY helps another up to check the top of the train. The SECOND COP jumps back down. SWAT COP #2 All clear. 
ANGLE BACK Fait turns back to Daria. Signals her to climb up onto the top of the train. Then begins climbing after her. As Fait reaches the driver's window, he sees ANOTHER SWAT COP approaching the train's DRIVER, checking under seats, etc. Fait has to climb fast. The SWAT Guy and the Driver getting closer. Looking up. Just as... 
INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - THEIR POV - CONTINUOUS ACTION Fait's leg just clears the window.      They don't see it. But... 
INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION As Fait rolls onto the top of the train... 
INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - CONTINUOUS ACTION The NOISE causes the SWAT Cop to react.      To the Driver -- SWAT COP #3 Hold it. 
A moment, as they stop and the Cop looks around.    The Cop checks the Driver's compartment. Nothing. SWAT COP #3 (radios) Train's clear. The Cop exits.    The Driver enters his compartment. 
FAIT Yeah?   Make me an offer. Su stands. 
SU You can walk out of here. FAIT ... No deal. Fait launches   himself at Su. Gonna fight     his way    out the door. A much    better fighter than Miles.     And...    He's saved by the bell:    the PHONE RINGS. The fight     stops.     The phone's near   Fait. Beat. The answering      machine    picks up. 
CHRISTOPHE (V.O.) Christophe here. Leave a message. BEEP. LING (V.O.) I know you're there, Mr. Fait. Beat.   Fait pushes the button for the speakerphone. FAIT Who's this? INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT Overlooking L.A. Ling and Sona. Enjoying hotel room service. Ling's on a cell phone. LING The man for   whom Mr. Christophe arranged to   have the black stones brought into   the country and deposited at   the jewelry exchange. The man who   wants them back. Now. FAIT Fine.   How much? LING Maybe you didn't understand me.    The stones are already mine. FAIT I got 'em, I'm selling 'em. So get your bid in or go fuck yourself. 
LING I don't have time for this. FAIT That your final offer? 
LING I can be a very dangerous man, Mr. Fait. Fait just hangs up. FAIT Everybody think I'm the fucking Goodwill or something...? Look, I've had a shitty night, and so far, I got zip for all my troubles. So I don't know who the fuck you are, and I don't care. But hear this: you can beat my ass around the block all night -- Brother, it ain't gonna get you those stones. A long beat. The two men facing off. Then... As Su stands aside, giving Fait a clear path out... 
EXT. STREET NEAR CHRISTOPHE'S - NIGHT Fait slides into his Porsche and drives off. 
INT./EXT. FAIT'S PORSCHE - NIGHT Fait's checking his rearview mirror. Sees a black Cadillac Escalade pull away from the curb and follow. Fait doesn't need it. FAIT Oh, man... He's about    to punch it. When... A cop car turns a corner and falls    in beside him. Fait throttles back. Keeps driving.     Until, finally... The cops turn off. And now... Fait hits    it. Until... Traffic ahead forces Fait to turn into an alley in a semi- industrial area. Behind him, the Escalade tries to follow, but is cut off by the on-coming cars. We STAY WITH Fait. He GUNS down the alley. Reaches an intersecting alley. Turns. GUNS it out of sight. 
INT./EXT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS ACTION Finally forcing its way through on-coming traffic and speeding down the alley after Fait. The ESCALADE reaches the intersection. Turns. And... CRASHES into a DUMPSTER rolled into its path. The dumpster forces the Escalade into a wall. 
EXT. ALLEY (SEMI-INDUSTRIAL AREA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION Two men start to get out of the Escalade. We recognize them: Ling's two thugs. We barely have time to realize that Fait's escape has been blocked by construction equipment down the alley. He's had no choice but to turn and fight. 
FAIT Runs the biggest outfit in town. What warlords are to Afghanistan, Chambers is to L.A... And you want to take him on, you're on your own. Game over for me. (beat; then) And now that I'm truly fucked -- what the hell are you, anyway? You got some I.D.? Beat.   Su takes out his wallet and shows him. 
INSERT - I.D. 
In Chinese.     Clearly official. FAIT Doesn't mean shit to me. ARCHIE Let me see that. Archie takes it, reads. ARCHIE Taiwan. Central Security Bureau. Taiwanese intelligence. FAIT You read Chinese? ARCHIE No. But I know 'cop' in every language. FAIT What, you some kinda Asian James Bond? SU The stones belong to my government. FAIT Yeah, well, they're Chambers' now. And even governments don't go to war with him. UNDER which, Fait's CELL PHONE starts RINGING. FAIT I'm starting to hate this phone. (answers) What now? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. LIMOUSINE - TIGHT ON LING AND SONA - NIGHT 
Ling's on his cell phone. LING I hope you've reconsidered. FAIT Hey, it's Mr. Dangerous.   'Sup, 'homie'? LING You've made this difficult, Mr. Fait. Let me make it easy. FAIT Can't wait to hear. LING I have your daughter. Fait freezes. LING She's very pretty in her pink pajamas. Aren't you, Vanessa? REVEAL Vanessa, in the limo, held by Charles.     On Ling's signal, Charles uncovers her mouth. VANESSA Daddy! FAIT Vanessa! LING I want my stones, Mr. Fait. FAIT Motherfucker... LING You think about it a moment. Let me talk to the Chinese gentleman who's with you. FAIT Don't you hurt her. LING That's up to you... The Chinese 
gentleman, please? Beat.   Fait hands the phone to Su. FAIT He has my daughter. 
ARCHIE Oh, Jesus... FAIT He wants to talk to you. Su takes the phone.   In CHINESE with ENGLISH SUBTITLES -- SU Hello. LING I thought I killed you. SU I have the stones.      No negotiations. Let the girl go. LING Do you really want one more person to die? We see this resonates with Su. SU No negotiations. And then, he simply hangs up. END INTERCUT. FAIT What'd you just do?     What happened? SU I said I have the stones and won't negotiate for your daughter. FAIT You what? ARCHIE Oh, Jesus... SU It will confuse him.     Buy us time and keep her alive. FAIT 
What the fuck're you talking about? That asshole has my daughter. SU Look -- I know him. (then) I want the stones, you want your daughter. We'll get them both back. We'll work together. FAIT ... I gotta work with you? SU You have no choice. 
Beat.   Fait realizes what this means. FAIT ... Shit... We gotta go see Chambers... (beat, then) Oh, god... Vanessa... 
INT./EXT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION Vanessa is standing inside, still yelling. CHARLES Shut up! VANESSA You shut up! CHARLES Go to sleep! Vanessa reaches over and flicks ON the camper's TV.   Turns it UP LOUD. Giving him stink-eye defiance as... Charles slams the door shut.   Locks it.   And... Now that Vanessa's made her point, and Charles can't see her anymore, her boldness begins to subside. She lies down on the bed and curls up, alone and scared inside the dark camper. Vanessa holds up the pink diamond pendant and gazes at it. A talisman. Connecting her to her father. Not making the fear go away, but giving her strength. 
CLOSEUP - FAIT As he drives, just as if he can sense Vanessa's need for him FAIT Angels east, angels west, north and south, do your best. Guard her, watch her, while she rests. 
OFF which, as Su regards him... 
INT. MEDIUM SECURITY PRISON - CELLBLOCK - DAY A prison guard escorts Fait and Su past cells, each just as dreary, spare and institutional as the next. That is, until they reach the last cell. The last cell is guarded by two convict sentries.    Hanging blankets cloak the cell entirely from view. Fait, Su and the prison guard stop outside the cell. One sentry blocks the way in as the other parts the blankets covering the open cell doorway, REVEALING... 
INT./EXT. CHAMBER'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION After a walk through Kansas, this is the land of Oz. The last cell is as comfy, colorful and a well-appointed as Joel's office. JUMP CHAMBERS, a large, brutal-looking, inner-city crime lord has clearly used money and influence to improve the terms of his incarceration. Chambers puffs a Cuban as a prison trustee, WILLY CHICKENS, sets out breakfast before him: fresh-squeezed OJ; eggs benedict; large, juicy sausages; fresh breads and pastries; French-press coffee; LA TIMES, NY TIMES, WSJ, Maxim, Hustler and the daily mail. The guard leaves Fait and Su, turns to go. CHAMBERS Metz. The guard, METZ, stops and looks back. CHAMBERS D.V.D.'s broke. METZ Get you a new one straight away, Mr. Chambers. Metz goes. Beat.   Chambers eyes Fait and Su through his cigar smoke. CHAMBERS Thanks for your patience.   Man needs his nightly rest. (then) Who's the gook? 
FAIT ... Chinese guy. CHAMBERS ... No shoes in my crib. 
Then, when Fait and Su have removed their shoes -- CHAMBERS In. The sentries move aside. Fait and Su enter. Chambers ash- trays his Cuban and digs into b-fast. FAIT How you doing, Jump? CHAMBERS Don't waste my precious time. FAIT ... I got a problem. CHAMBERS How's Daria? FAIT ... Good. CHAMBERS Always was good. From the moment I found her till the moment you took her away from me. Problem, you say? FAIT ... The black stones. CHAMBERS Bitch brought it in. Made me a lotta money. But that all stopped. You stopped that. You decided it was okay to put an end to that. Black stones. Go on. FAIT I need 'em back. CHAMBERS Only smart thing was not pimping her yourself, 'cause then I'da been real sore-angry, and you'da both been real cold-dead... CHAMBERS (CONT'D) But you don't pimp, do you? Just a 
thief in the night. Stealing what don't belong to you. Chambers turns to Su.   In SUBTITLED KOREAN -- CHAMBERS You like tall white women? Su doesn't say anything.   Back to English -- CHAMBERS He can't talk? SU I don't speak Korean. 
Chambers carves up a sausage. CHAMBERS Bought myself this Korean club downtown. Packing in the Seoul brothers 24-7-365... Black man gouging Koreans, ain't that a switch... Motherfuckers got faces like walls, but they love to drink liquor and look at naked girls... Place is no shitbox, either. Got me an office looks like a kabuki love palace. My own little sanctuary -- A QUICK SHOT OF Fait, taking this in. CHAMBERS -- just waiting for when I parole out... Stop by sometime, eyeball the poon. FAIT ... Jump, my daughter's mixed up in this. I gotta have the stones, or she's dead. No response.   Chambers just keeps eating. FAIT If you need something more than that, here it is... (this is hard) I'm begging you, Jump. Still no response... Chambers finishes eating.    Wipes his face. Finally -- CHAMBERS Big heist. Risky heist. Breaking news. I'm watching it wondering why. 
What's worth that kind of trouble, that kind of heat? Gotta be something good. Gotta be something expensive. Beat.   He meets Fait's eyes.   Holds them. 
CLOSEUP - ACCELERATOR PEDAL To reveal Vanessa's rigged a soda can to the pedal. An extension for her short legs. As her foot tromps down on the can... 
ANGLE - CAMPER takes off. The windows are blacked out and Vanessa can't see where she's going. But she's going. 
INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION The camper careens around the large space.   Charles scrambles after. 
INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION Vanessa keeps driving blind, pedal to the metal. 
INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION The CAMPER veers toward the rear wall.   And... ... CRASHES into a support post. As Charles yanks Vanessa from the wrecked van, unhurt... 
INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY A hostess bar, but very high-end. Beautiful women. Elegant decor. Pumping MUSIC. No strip-club cheese. For extra money, private rooms for private pleasures. It's day, but the place is wall-to-wall with Korean men. Chambers' African-Americans maintain low visibility:   at the door, behind the scenes, counting the register, etc. ODION, a dangerous-looking Chambers main man, moves through the crowd to Daria, waiting near the front door. ODION Delicious Daria. DARIA 'Sup, Odion? ODION Long time no see. Then, checking her out -- ODION Like cognac. Just getting better. (then) So what brings you around? DARIA ... Sometimes you need an old friend, y'know? ODION Got trouble? DARIA ... With a capital 'T.' ODION Tony Fait? Thought you and him were tight. Bonnie and Clyde. DARIA Used to be that way. Not treating me right these days. The kid's all he cares about. ODION ... What do you want me to do? DARIA ... Man, I don't know. Probably nothing you can do. I just 
thought... (then) Hey, y'know, this is crazy. I don't know what I was thinking. I shouldn't even be here like this. Sorry, Odion. 
Daria starts to go.   Odion stops her. ODION Nah, hey, hold up. It's okay. DARIA Back in the day... Just always seemed like you and I had something special between us. 
ODION Didn't know you thought so. DARIA I always cared for you, Odion. That's why I'm here. ODION ... You looking for a job? DARIA I need something. ODION ... So maybe you could work here. DARIA Here?... Oh, man, I don't know. ODION You were the best. Not many girls pulling in two g's a night. DARIA Yeah, but it's been a while for that... Might not remember how. ODION Just like a bicycle, baby.     You don't forget that stuff. Daria considers it a moment. DARIA Don't know how Jump'd feel about it. Having me back. ODION Hey, you let me worry about Jump, 
okay? (then) Meantime, why don't you come on in, and you and me can, y'know, talk some more about it. 
Daria just stands there a moment, getting her body into the music. Then starts dancing for him. Slow and sexy. And Odion's eating it up. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY Fait and Miles climb onto the roof with gear bags.   Via earwig mike -- FAIT Tommy. 
INT./EXT. PEST CONTROL TRUCK - DAY 
Tommy's behind the wheel, wearing a pest control uniform. TOMMY Here come da bug man. 
EXT. KOREAN CLUB - STREET IN FRONT - DAY The DOORMAN watches Tommy drive up in the pest-control truck, put on a respirator, get out, unreel 20 feet of pest spray hose from the truck and advance toward the door. TOMMY Hey.    Howzit? DOORMAN What the hell you doing? TOMMY Pest control. Don't tell me you didn't get your notice. DOORMAN What notice? TOMMY See, that burns my ass right to the bone. I mean, hey, I'm here doing my job... Anyway, putting that aside, if you had gotten your notice, you'd know there's a new city ordinance saying all businesses catering to foreigners gotta be sprayed. DOORMAN Yeah?    How come? TOMMY 'Cause foreign people're bringing all 
their scary-assed foreign bugs over here. Y'know, in their luggage and shit. And then the bugs're getting loose and fucking everything up -- eating all the trees and everything, y'know, making people sick... Anyway, city says we gotta spray to prevent any infestation and possible spread. DOORMAN We're doing business inside. Can't let you just start hosing the place with bug spray. TOMMY Yeah, well, maybe you should at least ask the manager about it. DOORMAN Manager's busy. TOMMY ... Okay. Your call. Just know the city quarantine people'll be here first thing tomorrow. DOORMAN Quarantine people? TOMMY They'll be shutting you down for non- compliance... Peace out. Tommy starts to go. DOORMAN Wait, wait, wait. Tommy stops. DOORMAN City's really gonna come and close us up? TOMMY Quicker'n a Zip-loc. DOORMAN ... You sure you're not fucking with me? TOMMY I'm a licensed exterminator.   Why would I be fucking with you? The Doorman considers it another moment.   Then -- 
TOMMY Look. Let's do this. You let me start with a couple small rooms, y'know, offices or something, someplace you don't have customers. Upstairs, so the fumes don't bother anybody. I'll pop off a couple bug bombs, and then we'll do the rest later. How's that? The Doorman considers a moment.     Then -- DOORMAN ... Yeah, okay. Get the bombs, and come on. 
INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY Daria keeps dancing. Peeling off layers now.    Showing skin. Odion's starting to salivate. 
INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY What Chambers' cell is to a normal cell, this place is to a normal office. No expense spared. (Think Joel again.) A large, "Zen" FOUNTAIN BURBLES meditatively in the center of the room. The door opens.   The Doorman admits Tommy, who looks around in amazement. 
TOMMY ... Look.   At.   This. DOORMAN Just do your thing and go, bro. TOMMY Roger that. He positions the BUG BOMBS. Then.... PFFFT.     He sets off one. PFFFT. The other. As he goes -- TOMMY Just keep the door closed and be sure to give this shit a full hour before anyone comes in. OFF the closing door... 
FAIT Everyone out. Fait's started searching the room.       Tearing it apart. MILES What about you? FAIT I gotta save Vanessa.     I gotta find 'em. MILES I'm not leaving you. FAIT Yes, you are.    Go.   Now. Someone starts RATTLING the LOCKED DOOR.      Fait doesn't stop. MILES T. Come on, man. They're outside. Give it up. FAIT Shut up and get the fuck outta here! That's an order! Miles hesitates. Fait's unreachable. Chambers' men are trying to break down the door. Miles goes. Out the window. Onto the ascender-descender. And gone. 
INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT Daria finishes dressing.     When... CHAMBERS MAN ... Y'know, I got the big one... Her response is a front kick to the head. Followed by a spin kick, knocking him out. Then, stepping past him -- DARIA Keep it in your pants. 
INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY CRASH!   Odion and his men break down the door. 
Fait's still searching. Desperate to find the stones. Desperate to save his daughter. He fights off the first men to reach him. A wild animal. Fights off another. And then... 
The guns are out.     All pointed at Fait. No stones. No exit. 
INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY Daria walks out the front door. 
INT. CHAMBERS' CELL - DAY 
Willy Chickens hovers near Chambers, who is talking as he eats another meal. Lobster. At first, we don't realize who Chambers is addressing. CHAMBERS ... If you're willing to pay five, you're willing to pay ten. CHAMBERS (CONT'D) You're    willing to pay ten, you're willing    to pay twenty. Twenty, forty.     Forty, eighty... I'm not selling    till I know exactly where the ceiling    is. Whereupon we see who he's talking to:     Ling. CHAMBERS You like foreplay? LING How much money do you want for the stones? CHAMBERS I hate foreplay. Fuck the warm-up drills -- girl's gotta get in there and be ready to score points. Bring it straight to the motherfucking hoop. You understand? (beat) So, instead of us going back and forth doing warm-ups, my idea's for you to think of a number. A very high number. A very final number. A number so high and final it'll get me off good, bam, right when I hear it. Chambers hasn't looked at Ling the whole time.       Still isn't looking. Forks up some lobster meat. When... 
Chickens' face suddenly appears in front of him. And... Ling slams a lobster claw deep into Chickens' neck. Chambers doesn't wait for whatever's next. Jumps back. Fast for a big man. 
But Ling is much faster. Stronger. Deadlier. Quickly, and quietly beats Chambers like a drum. Chambers knows when it's finally tent-folding time. Croaks surrender through the blood and swelling -- 
Not yet. The PARAMEDIC treating him doesn't understand. PARAMEDIC What? 
FAIT Nothing. 
CLOSEUP - BEHIND FAIT'S BACK His cuffed hands.    Fingers feeling the inside of his belt. Finding a spot where a small rectangle has been cut into the leather. Popping out the rectangle to reveal a hollowed-out recess in the belt. Where... Fait has a hidden handcuff key. 
CLOSEUP - ANOTHER SET OF HANDS struggling against their duct-tape bonds.   REVEAL... 
INT. CAMPER - DAY Vanessa's hands are taped together behind her back. There's tape around her feet. Tape over her mouth. The TV is ON nearby, but she's not watching. Vanessa struggles a moment longer, but can't break the tape. Finally gives up trying. Just lies there. Tired and scared. 
INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY DING! The crowd's yelling and betting as number eight leaves his corner and advances on Su. Su has nothing against number eight. He's just trying to buy time. So he dodges his opponent. Not exactly running. Fighting by not fighting. A target one moment, gone the next. Again and again, number eight swings and misses. Until... Number eight delivers a knockout blow. Unfortunately it's against himself. The momentum of a missed punch carries him headfirst into a metal post. Number eight drops. As the referee counts over number eight, Su uses the chance to find... 
ARCHIE still checking out the hands of African-American men in the crowd. Not making any friends as he does it. 
SU Number eight's on his feet.    Moving in again.   When... 
ARCHIE Suddenly, he sees it.    The ring. 
SU dodges number eight again. Then... Sees Archie signaling he's found the guy. And... Gets nailed by number eight. A solid hit. Exciting the crowd and pumping up number eight. Whereupon... Su turns to him and bows. SU You win. Su turns, heads out of the cage. The crowd roaring its disapproval. As... The midget Ring Announcer bars Su's path. RING ANNOUNCER No quitting.    Get back in there. Su moves him aside. The midget resists. Five other waiting fighters come to the midget's aid. Forcing Su back into the cage. Where... It's now Su against them all. 
One problem: so is the moto-cross bike.     The guy's right on Fait's ass. Matching move with move. Overhead, police choppers follow Fait's every move. While on the ground other police vehicles move to block his path. But whenever Fait meets a roadblock, he somehow finds an escape. At one point, he uses an outdoor escalator. At another point he blasts through the Hotel Bonaventure. This'll be a news highlight for days to come. 
INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY The place is bedlam. In the crowd, bets are going down on the battle royal, now in full effect inside the cage. Su versus the five fighters. And the midget. The different fighters use different fighting styles against Su. Kickboxing, grappling, aikido, kali, American street fighting... Su uses all his own skills and whatever's at hand. At one point he engineers it so one opponent turns on another opponent. At another point, Su wields the midget like a fighting staff. One by one, Su starts reducing the opposition. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY Fait's everywhere.   And so is the moto-bike.   Still on his tail. Fait veers inside a building.   The bike follows. 
INT. BUILDING - VARIOUS SHOTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION Fait and the moto-bike ascend the stairs.   One floor.   Two floors. Up and up. Fait reaches the top-floor hallway.   Nowhere left to go except... Out the window at the end.   And... That's just where he goes. 
And where he goes, the moto-bike goes. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS The ATV and the moto-bike make the first leap.    Onto the roof of a next-door building. From there, it's rooftop to rooftop.    Jump after jump. Longer and longer. Until... The MOTO-BIKE eats it in a spectacular CRASH.     The moto- rider walks away, but his chase is over. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY 
Fait's ATV SCREAMS down another street, still chased by cops. Into his mike -- FAIT Yo. 
INT. DARIA, MILES AND TOMMY'S CAR - DRIVING - DAY DARIA Here. FAIT Above ground parking garage in Chinatown? MILES Know it. FAIT Get there. 
INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY It's down to Su and the kick boxer.    The kick boxer spins and kicks and punches, and... Su just ties the guy up in his own clothes.    Ties him into a pretzel. Cinches him tight. Then... Looks for Archie.     Can't find him. Can't find the guy wearing the ring.     And hurries out of the cage. 
FAIT Yeah.   That's what I'm getting. SU The doorman. 
FAIT ... Where the hell is he? (then) Everyone stay put. OFF which, as he and Su go -- 
INT. KOREAN CLUB - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT MUSIC pumps downstairs as Su and Fait cautiously move down the hall toward Chambers' office. FAIT No Chambers' guys.     I don't get it. They reach the closed office door, where they stop and listen. Hear nothing. Su and Fait exchange a "ready-ready" look.     Then Su opens the door. 
INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION Su and Fait enter, unchallenged, to find... Odion and the other Chambers' men.    Dead.   Skull shot. FAIT I get it now. Su ignores the bodies, quickly moves to the Zen fountain, where he reaches into the water and begins searching the rocks lining the bottom. Beat. Then -- FAIT Are they there? Su doesn't answer, still searching. FAIT No. This can't fucking happen.      They gotta be there. Another beat. Then, at last, Su holds something up:         one black stone. It takes Fait a moment to understand. 
FAIT ... What?     That's it? SU The rest are gone. 
Fait can't believe it. FAIT ... What the hell happened?        Who got 'em? SU ... Ling. FAIT How do you know? SU I know. FAIT ... How'd he get here before us? SU He's good. Beat.   Failure.       Summed up in one word: FAIT Vanessa... (then, trying) He has the stones. There's      no reason to keep her. Hell, she's a      little girl, she's eight years old     -- she can't hurt him. He can let      her go... He can just fucking let her     go... Su just looks at him.        Not a chance.   And he knows Fait knows it, too. It's over.     For Fait, it's as if his life just ended. FAIT ... What the hell am I gonna do? SU ... We need to go. Fait doesn't move. Then, suddenly, it all explodes as rage, and Fait picks up the large, stone ball spinning atop the fountain and, screaming, hurls it into a large display of exotica, destroying it. Beat.   Fait looks at Su, who meets his eyes.          Then -- 
SU Come on. OFF which, as Su mobilizes him, and they go... 
INT. HANGAR - NIGHT Ling pours the black stones out on a table.   To Sona and Charles -- LING We're back in business. CHARLES Good. I don't have to baby-sit much longer. SONA I hate kids. LING Is everything else ready? SONA We just have to test the device. Russell, who's been working on his scientific contraption nearby, speaks up. RUSSELL Dye master oscillator. And not test, calibrate. Which I'm now ready to do... Goggles. When the goggles are on, Russell hits a switch.   And... Inside the contraption, brilliant green laser BEAMS begin bombarding a sensor. OFF which... 
INT. CAMPER - NIGHT Vanessa succeeds in using the necklace   as a saw to free her wrists from the duct-tape. She quickly    rips the tape from her mouth. Untapes her ankles. Then tries     to figure out what to do next. Begins searching the camper for    anything that might help her escape or fight. When... Looking through the glove box, she finds a cell phone. An old model. So old, it takes her a moment to figure out exactly what it is. Then she pushes "Power," and... The phone turns on.    Sort of. CLOSEUP - CELL PHONE 
"Low Batt" flashes on the screen. INT. FAIT'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Rock bottom. 
FAIT You see chairs and green light? Where's the light coming from? VANESSA I can't tell. SU Is it bright? 
FAIT The green light, baby -- is it bright? VANESSA Yeah.   Really, really bright. FAIT (to Su) It's real bright. VANESSA Daddy, hurry!    I'm scared! FAIT I know, baby.    Just hang in there 
CLOSEUP - VANESSA'S PHONE Fait's voice drops out as the battery dies. 
BACK TO SCENE VANESSA ... Daddy?!   Daddy?!... END INTERCUT. FAIT ... Vanessa?... Vanessa!... Shit! Fait slams the phone down in frustration. But Su's mind is on what she told them. SU ... He's doing it here.    Tonight. 
TOMMY What? SU Selling the stones... A dye laser emits green light. He needs it to activate them. MILES What the hell you talking about? DARIA What are these stones? Archie answers it. 
ARCHIE Doomsday in disguise. All eyes go to him. ARCHIE They're some kinda new synthetic plutonium. Small and portable, but mega-powerful. TOMMY This fucker's making bombs? SU Not making them. ARCHIE Yeah, he'd need a big operation for that. Why bother? Just demonstrate the stones work and sell 'em to whichever international scumbag offers the highest bid. He makes millions, they make the bombs, then... 'look out, world.' FAIT ... Okay, so we know what he's up to. How's it get us to Vanessa? Su considers it a moment. SU The buyers will want to arrive and leave quickly... Somewhere private... Accessible by aircraft. FAIT Vanessa said she's inside a big building. Could be a hangar. 
MILES Man, there's dozens of little airports around here. We'd never get to 'em all. SU ... Flight plans. ARCHIE Hey, yeah. Flight plans show destinations. All aircraft file 'em with the Aviation Administration. If we could get a list, we could maybe figure out where the sale's going down. 
FAIT ... Daria, call the aviation people. Use our L.A.P.D. credentials. We need flight plan info for all private aircraft in this area tonight... Everyone else get ready to move... Miles, the no-gun policy's revoked. You break out the heat... Tommy, you gotta get us a diversion. ARCHIE I can help with that. FAIT ... Do it all fast. 
INT. HANGAR - NIGHT Ling, Sona, Charles, and Russell. Russell finishes testing his contraption.    Switches it OFF. Then, removing his goggles -- RUSSELL We're operational. The others remove their goggles.    Sona checks her watch. SONA The buyers arrive in less then an hour. Beat.   Ling holds up a black stone and examines it. LING ... So small. So deadly... We're selling conscience for money... A look at the others.   Serious.   Then a broad smile of 
consummate satisfaction suddenly spreads across his face. LING ... But it's a lot of money... Beat.   He puts down the stone.    A glance at the camper. 
EXT. FAIT'S PORSCHE - NIGHT Driving.   Daria and Miles following in their car. FAIT (V.O.) So tell me... How the hell's Taiwan fit into all this? SU (V.O.) One of our scientists made the stones. Tried to go into business for himself. We stopped him. Recovered the stones... Ling betrayed us. He took them. FAIT (V.O.) Ling?   He was one of you? SU (V.O.) We were partners. Six of us. He killed the others. He thought he killed me, too. FAIT (V.O.) (beat) So what're you really after -- the stones or the payback? SU 
Both. FAIT (V.O.) ... Yeah... Let's get it all. 
INT. HANGAR - NIGHT LING You're the world's foremost arms dealers. You all know that weaponry equals power. And in the world of weaponry, nukes rule. (MORE) LING (CONT'D) But nuclear material is hard to obtain and difficult to handle... But what if it weren't?... That's the question that brought you here tonight... And here's the answer. Ling holds up a single stone. LING In its present state, it's completely inert. Zero radiation, zero volatility... Whereupon Ling places the stone on a piece of velvet on a table. Folds the velvet over. Then, whack, hits it hard with a mallet. He unfolds the velvet.   The stone's smashed to pieces. Ling picks up a sliver of stone and hands it to Russell, who places the sliver inside a small ceramic capsule, then inserts the capsule into his contraption. RUSSELL Goggles on. Everyone puts on goggles. Then Russell hits the switch, and the green lasers bombard the capsule containing the sliver of stone, which begins to glow. Russell announces each passing threshold as a numerical readout on the contraption races up the scale -- RUSSELL ... Firecracker... .44 magnum... R.P.G... Sidewinder... SCUD... Tomahawk... Daisy Cutter... Hiroshima... two Hiroshimas... And it just keeps going.   Until, finally -- 
RUSSELL ... New World Order. As the buyers absorb this... 
Russell shuts off the beams. RUSSELL Goggles off. Russell removes the capsule and hands it back to Ling, who holds it up. LING One small    fragment. Transformed into a source    of immense energy. More powerful    than weapons-grade plutonium a hundred    times its size. A beat as this sinks in. SONA The purpose of today's sale is to begin trading a new commodity on the black market and establish its value... There are fifty stones available in the first sale. The opening price is one million per stone... Bids, please? The buyers indicate their bids both aloud and by using hand signals a la traders in a commodities exchange pit. At the same time, they're all crunching the numbers on calculators. Ling looks on as Sona runs the sale, and Russell uses a laptop to input data and develops supply and demand market- analysis for Sona to consult. The pace starts out slowly and unevenly as the buyers feel out the situation. RUSSIAN BUYER Five at one million. Sona is silent.   Silence means "No." AFRICAN BUYER Five at one-point-two. Silence. PAKISTANI BUYER Three at two million. SONA 
We'll take that. FRENCH BUYER Six at one-five. Silence. 
EGYPTIAN BUYER Ten at two million. Silence. 
EXT. WICK AIRFIELD - FAIT AND DARIA - NIGHT Near their cars. 
(NOTE: From now until the battle's over, it's night. At the airport, Fait, Su and Fait's team will all communicate via earwigs.) FAIT Miles, what do you see? 
EXT. AIRFIELD - ROOF Atop the building next to Ling's hangar. The five choppers rest on the wide tarmac below, between the two buildings. Miles scans Ling's hangar through the scope of a silenced sniper rifle. 
Ling getting into the limo.    To Archie and   Tommy, as he signals -- SU Don't let him get away! 
As a result of which... 
TOMMY AND ARCHIE Having just waxed Russell, see Ling in the limo. Tommy's .50 is out of ammo. He switches to the .30 cal. tank's machine gun. As Archie steers toward the limo, Tommy begins BLASTING away. 
LIMO Ling's trying to drive out, when the .30 CAL. SLUGS PUNCH HOLES in the LIMO. The tank keeps coming. Ling bails out as the TANK CRUSHES the LIMO. INTERCUT WITH which... 
SU AND SONA Play cat and mouse. Su rapidly runs out of room to hide. He can't get away. Su stands. Faces her. Faces the inevitable. When... WHAM! Daria appears from nowhere. Kicks the gun from Sona's hand. To Su, re: Ling, now running from the crushed limo DARIA Get him. Su goes after Ling. And now it's Daria vs. Sona. Sona's a better fighter, but Daria's got passion on her side. It's a good fight. Until, at last, Sona finds the Scorpion. She swings it up. And... Daria executes a sudden, improvised double move that strikes Sona's arm in such a way as to cause her to point the SCORPION at herself, just as she FIRES. The burst rips through her chest and kills her. And now, here's what's been going on outside... 
EXT. AIRFIELD 
As Charles runs from the hangar, chasing Vanessa across the tarmac into the darkness of the airfield... 
MILES 
flips to NIGHT VISION on the sniper-scope.    And... 
SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION Charles and Vanessa become clearly visible. Charles is closing in on her. Cross-hairs FIND him. PHUT!

FADE UP ON: SPACE. Infinite stars. A TITLE: 
1870. THE ARIZONA TERRITORY. We descend past DARK CLOUDS. Violent FLASHES ripple within. Thunder blends with DRUMS as we reach a BOX CANYON... 
A BONFIRE -- SILHOUETTED BODIES -- APACHE WARRIORS Whirling around the fire -- war paint -- masks and headdresses -- a RELIGIOUS RITE or CELEBRATION. On the periphery, we FIND... A BEAUTIFUL APACHE WOMAN. Softly singing to the even more beautiful BABY in her arms as we FOLLOW THEM INTO -- A TEEPEE. The simple melody of the woman's song as she lays the baby on a blanket, gently swaddling it, LOVE in her eyes. But. The wind starts to HOWL. QRAJ. And then... a BURST OF LIGHT through the opening of the teepee -- intense ULTRAVIOLET: FWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSHHss!!! 
THE E IRE TENT IS RIPPED UP INTO THE SKY, LEAVING THE WOMAN AND HER BABY-EXPOSED!!!! She SCREAMS -- grabs her child and starts to RUN -- CHAOS EVERYWHERE as the tribe scatters in TERROR -- Suddenly -- Apaches are getting YANKED INTO THE AIR by some superior force -- PLUCKED savagely into the light, GONE -- as we WHIP AROUND the horror show of SCREAMING, DISAPPEARING INDIANS -- And now -- A DEAFENING SHRIEK AS STRANGE DOMED OBJECTS HURTLE 
DOWN, CRASHING LIKE COMETS TO THE CANYON FLOOR AND CRUSHING 
FLEEING PEOPLE. Impossibly, the objects are STEEL MACHINES. BELLY VENTS snap open and DRILL CONES drop out -- jagged teeth CHURN TO LIFE -- faster -- FASTER -- as the drills begin CHEWING INTO THE GROUND. THE WOMAN -- staggering back in SHOCK and AWE -- clings to her baby for one final SCREAM and -- BLACK. Over which we read: C--() ... .-4ï¿½_ s A N D A 
EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY 
burning sun FLARES LENS, beating down on... A MAN. Lying in the barren DESERT. Out cold. Handsome... but HARD. We'll call him THE MAN IN BLACK, the color of his dirty clothes. 
A PINK TONGUE LICKS HIM. The man STARTS AWAKE -- to find a MONGREL DOG over him. Mangy. But sweet. COUGHING, the man stumbles up. How'd he get here? And where the hell i.: here? And -- OWWW. A GASH in his side... .. part of the wound oddly SEARED. He winces. Trying to solve this painful puzzle. Something GLINTS on his wrist: A STEEL BRACELET. No clasp to pull it off. He touches the surface -- TSSS -- SHIT -- It's HOT! And there's a BLACK STETSON on the ground. The Man grabs it to shield his eyes... but STOFS: A WORN PHOTOGRAPH in the inner brim. A WOMAN. Young, beautiful. SMILING. The Man stares: does he KNOW this woman? is this even HIS hat? The dog BARKS ALERT. The man turns -- QUICK -- his hand reaches toward his hip on INSTINCT but there's no holster. NO GUNS. 
THREE RIDERS ON HORSEBACK ARE COMING OVER THE RISE: THE CLAIBORNE BROTHERS -- WES, MOSE and LUKE. Dusty and tough. Wes gallops right up to our Man, gives him the once over -- 
WES CLAIBORNE Howdy. 
(NO RESPONSE) We're riding towards Absolution. You know how far west we are? The Man's got NO IDEA what he's talking about. 
LUKE CLAIBORNE Maybe he's a dummy. Wes hops off his horse, right in The Man's face now -- 
WES CLAIBORNE There a reason you don't wanna answer my question, friend? And now, Mose nods to the BRACELET on The Man's wrist -- 
MOSE CLAIBORNE Wes, he's got iron on his wrist... and he's been shot. 
LUKE CLAIBORNE Bet he's a chain jumper. Luke spurs his horse behind him -- The Man's SURROUNDED. 
LUKE If he escaped, there'll be a bounty. Let's bring him with us. Wes nods as he slides a SAWED-OFF DOUBLE-BARREL from his back scabbard. COCKS both barrels. The dog GROWLS -- 
WES CLAIBORNE Not your lucky day, Stranger -- turn round and start walking. But The Man doesn't move. The Claibornes share glances. Wes steps forward -- RAISING HIS RIFLE -- 
WES CLAIBORNE (CONT'D) Dead or alive, no difference. I said 
WALK OR-- THE MAN MOVES, A MECHANISM OF BRUTAL VIOLENCE -- YANKS the rifle forward as BLAMI -- shot goes WILD -- suddenly the gun's in THE MAN'S HANDS -- BLAXI Wes is BLOWN backwards, HOLE IN HIS CHEST! As Hose draws his Enfield, The Man FLIPS the rifle again -- SLAM! MOSE FLIES OFF HIS SADDLE as The Man rolls -- UNDER Luke's horse -- GRABBING Luke's ankle -- suddenly Luke's FLAT on his back -- BREATHLESS, staring UP at the double-barrel: 
LUKE CLAIBORNE -- P-please, God -- d-don't -- -- The Man PULLS the trigger but CLICK! The rifle's EMPTY. Luke's RELIEF is short as The Man SLAMS the gun-butt down, knocking him out cold. And ALL of this took about ten seconds. This man is a cold-blooded KILLER. But somehow... he didn't seem to KNOW that. CONFUSION. Drops the rifle, looks down at his hands... covered in BLOOD. And the BODIES in his wake. The WIND loosens a piece of PAPER from Wes's jacket. It DANCES on the breeze -- flattens against The Stranger's foot. He picks it up, BLOODY FINGERPRINTS on what we now see is a TELEGRAM -- 
"TO FORT STANTON -- STOP -- ABSOLUTION TOWNSHIP BESIEGED BY 
OUTLAWS -- STOP -- FIFTY DOLLARS FOR ANY MAN WITH A GUN -- STOP 
-- ABSOLUTION AWAITS -- STOP" 
THE MAN IN BLACK (a hoarse whisper) Absolution... 
SLAM TO MOMENTS LATER: With a HYA! The Man sends two horses GALLOPING, mounts the third, wincing at that gash in his side. Starts to trot off... sees the dog following... 
THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D) Get outta here. Leave me alone. But the dog keeps following. Like they're FRIENDS now. The man turns away dismissively as we BOOM UP to reveal the WIDE OPEN VALLEY below... and a SPECK within it that is: 
EXT. TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY 
A CROOKED SIGN: "ABSOLUTION." The town is dismal and forgotten. Crumbling buildings blistered by sun. The Man rides in -- dehydrated, the wound DRAINING him. His eyes fall on the first building he sees... A CHURCH. 
ELLA His name's 'Happy.' HappyBARES HIS TEETH. INCHES from Atticus' face 
ATTICUS I'm sorry... 'Happy.' 
ELLA Alright then. (lowers her rifle) You're right. That was fun. 
-- Atticus scrambles back to his feet and OUT the door, as Ella looks at the Man In Black: 
ELLA (CONT'D) What're you doing with my dog? 
THE MAN IN BLACK I was hoping you could tell me. 
ELLA The hell're you talking ab--? WRIST BRACELET. Surprise and REVELATION: 
ELLA (CONT'D) Where... did you get that? Before he can answer, SHERIFF TAGGART enters, along with DEPUTY WADE (carrying a SHOTGUN), and 5 other deputies. They move cautiously to THE MAN, like he's a powder keg about to go off... 
SHERIFF TAGGART Hey there, "Luke." Mind following me down to the office so we can have us a chat...? 
THE MAN IN BLACK 
(CONFUSED; ALERT) What for? 
SHERIFF TAGGART All due respect, I'm the law, mister. That's what for. The men LOCK EYES: 
THE MAN IN BLACK Tell you what, Sheriff. How about you keep the fifty dollars you owe me and I just walk outta here like we. never met? 
SHERIFF TAGGART Because we did meet. ON ELLA. For reasons we're not sure of, the idea of The Man leaving ALARMS her. All the Gunslingers' hands are POISED by holsters. The Man stays preternaturally COOL: 
THE MAN IN BLACK L can't be accountable for what happens if they draw on me. 
SHERIFF TAGGART And what's gonna happen? 
THE MAN IN BLACK Best you don't find out. 
SHERIFF TAGGART Now why'd you have to go and say that? Taggart gives a nod and the men start to CONVERGE -- 
THE MAN IN BLACK (low; genuine plea) Don't. But Charlie makes a MOVE and The Man SLAMS his head into a pole -- the NEXT GUNMAN reaches for his pistol -- The Man PUNCHES his THROAT -- SLAMS the third into a bench -- The FOURTH straight down on the Faro table -- TAGGART levels his REPEATER -- but The Man just GRABS the barrel as Taggart FIRES a ROUND into the ceiling -- now the rifle's in THE MAN'S HANDS and just before he PULLS THE TRIGGER on Taggart: HE SEES EMMETT AT THE WINDOW. About to watch his father's MURDER... and The Man LOWERS the gun: 
THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D) I told you, I don't wanna hurt anyb-- CRACK! The butt of a PISTOL WHIPS the side of his SKULL! The Man DROPS as we REVEAL who just knocked his ass OUT: ELLA! Taggart draws a gun and pins The Man, whipping out that piece of paper he pulled from his office... 
SHERIFF TAGGART Yup -- looks just like him. 
NOW WE IT'S A WANTED POSTER WITH THE MAN'S FACE ON IT: 
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) "Jake Lonergan. Scourge a' The Territories. Wanted Dead or Alive." And The Man... now forever known as JAKE... stares WOOZILY into his OVERTURNED HAT... the photo tucked inside of the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN... her image goes BLURRY... then mil{: 
AND WHAM: 
MEMORY FLASHCUTS1 STROBELIXE IMAGES -- 1.) A tilted, handmade trail sign: "SAGUARO PASS." 2.) We're in a CABIN somewhere. BLINDING ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT EXPLODES INTO THE CABIN, against which a DEMONIC SILHOUETTE appears -- it looks like an INDIAN IN FULL-FEATHER HEADDRESS -- 
3.) A WOMAN'S FACE -- THE WOMAN FROM JAKE'S PHOTOGRAPH -- she looks at us and SCREAMS -- 4.) Now we're someplace VERY DARK -- a cave? As some kind of TERRIFYING OCULAR PROBE lowers right in front of our eyes -- 5.) Now we're RUNNING through the cave -- ESCAPE -- BREATHING HARD -- a LIGHT at the end of the tunnel -- BLINDING SUN hits us as we emerge -- our eyes ADJUST to see: 6.) A STRANGE ROCK FORMATION on the rim of a canyon -- like a STONE TOWER pointing to heaven as the SUN WHITEWASHES US TO: 
INT. JAIL CELL - PRE-DAWN 
JAKE'S EYES OPEN and he GASPS AIR! His POV: a FACE comes into FOCUS -- PERCY DOLARHYDE. GRINNING at him from the next cell: 
PERCY You're a dead. Jake sits up. Woozy. Blinking back to reality. 
PERCY (CONT'D) My daddy's comin' for me, Boy. You're gonna end up another dead shitheel under his spurs. I am gonna watch you suffer for a long, long -- Jake moves LIGHTNING QUICK -- reaching through the bars, GRABBING PERCY'S COLLAR, YANKING FORWARDS -- SLAMMING Percy's head into the bars, KNOCKING hIM OUT COLD AGAIN. Percy DROPS. 
JAKE Shut up. Jake sits back on his cot, rubbing his still-throbbing head. 
EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - JAIL - CONTINUOUS 
A PRISON WAGON pulls up in front of the Sheriff's office, along with Taggart's GUNMEN on horseback. ELLA takes frame as the men dismount and head into the office -- she pursues DEPUTY WADE with a real sense of PURPOSE: 
CHARLIE Best way to make a man stay put: chain him to his enemy. 
(A GRIN) You lovebirds have a nice trip now. SLAM: the door CLOSES and LOCKS. Jake SIGHS and tries to sit back, but it's hard tethered to Percy's slumped form. Shit. Then QWW -- something starts to STING and he looks down: HIS BRACELET. Has started PULSING RED. And it's getting WARM. Jake stares -- ON EDGE -- what the hell's happening? As -- OUTSIDE, Taggart mounts the buckboard. EMMETT feeds the horses: 
EMMETT You sure he's a bad guy, Pa? He did give Percy a lickin'. 
SHERIFF TAGGART He's bad enough. 
EMMETT (not so sure, but --) . can I come with you? 
SHERIFF TAGGART Too dangerous. 
EMMETT Dangerous to drive a damn coach? Why can't Charlie just take him? 
SHERIFF TAGGART Because it's my job, Emmett. That's what these people pay me to do. And your mother would kill me if I brought you. Emmett looks off, half sad, half angry -- 
EMMETT Good thing she's already dead then. And turns without a goodbye. Taggart watches him leave, wishing he could connect. Takes the reins and looks up -- REACTS: THAT MASSIVE. FRIGHTENING CLOUD IN THE SKY -- roiling faster toward town. The scary BLUE FLASHES within grow more INTENSE. IN THE COACH -- WITH JAKE, looking at the BRACELET, the pulsing growing MORE FREQUENT -- and then, a VOICE: 
ELLA (0.S. ) 
HEY! Jake turns to see ELLA, pushed up against the coach window: 
ELLA (CONT'D) Tell me where you got that bracelet... 
JAKE Maybe you should'a asked before you knocked me out.. 
ELLA Please... I need to know. Just tell me where you got it. 
JAKE Y dOli' .xBmbgX - - I don' t remember my name or where I've been or any of the things they said I done, so leave me the hell alone. And sits back as the coach starts to MOVE, leaving Ella in the dust. Some of the gunmen ride atop it; others on horseback cover the coach in a protective ring. Wade sees something incoming from the NORTH: 
DEPUTY WADE 
KYLE!!! Taggart looks up: Dolarhyde's gang racing down the mountain -- 
SHERIFF TAGGART 
DAMNIT -- He unslings his SHOTGUN as his men ready their weapons -- ON DOLARHYDE'S GANG, riding hard, guns ready too -- This is about to get UGLY. BUT... from the OTHER end of town, the WIND picks up -- As the massive storm cloud seems shockingly to have STORED AT A H -- its EYE churning, ROARING and... TWO BOLTS OF BLUE LIGHTNING CRACK DOWN FROM IT! Happy starts BARKING MADLY. Ella sees the lightning and starts to BACK AWAY in fear: 
ELLA NonoNO -- GET TO YOUR CELLARS! EVERYONE 
UNDERGROUND NAT! But her cries are LOST as -- RRRRRRRR!!!!! 
A LONG, NARROW FUNNEL SHOOTS FROM THE CHURNING CLOUD: A TORNADO! 
BREAKING THE MOMENTUM OF THE SHOWDOWN -- The stagecoach UPENDS, FLIPPING SIDEWAYS as the animals try to break free -- Taggart and his men are THROWN -- Inside, Jake and Percy TUMBLE end-over-end -- SLAMMING into walls, LOCKED TOGETHER -- JARRING Percy back to consciousness -- Dolarhyde's men are THROWN from their horses too as the animals STAMPEDE OFF in different directions -- THE 1Q8k=O ENGULFS THE TOWN! THE CONCUSSIVE BLAST BUCKLES 
BUILDINGS, PULLING WHOLE SECTIONS OF THEM INTO THE SKY! 
THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE. SHERIFF'S STATION. BROTHEL. WOOD 
STRIPPED RIGHT OFF THEIR FALSE FRONTS LIKE PIANO KEYS! Okay, wait. Just wait. Take a breath. 'Cause it's about ... . to get... . MORE insane... 
TEN MANTA RAY-SHAPED HOVER-SPEEDERS BURST FROM THE CYCLONE! ROARING into the town, FLYING just above ground -- 
TOWNSPEOPLE'S FACES -- GOING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE -- 19TH 
CENTURY BRAINS TRYING TO PROCESS THE IMPOSSIBLE -- 
MEACHAM Jesus God!! STRANGE STEEL RINGS fire from the speeders and mushroom out -- KA-CHING! -- SNAP OPEN and CLAMP around necks, arms, legs -- and from these steel collars, CABLES LASH OUT, whip-snapping back to the speeders and TETHERING MAGNETICALLY to them -- 
Yeah-these are HIGH-TECH LASSOS: 
HELPLESS VICTIMS ARE YANKED OFF THE GROUND AND PULLED BEHIND THE SPEEDERS LIKE ROPED STEER! Two of TAGGART'S GUNMEN. Now some of DOLARYHYDE' S. Screaming, just gone. THIS IS A...Qlp lam. EMMETT -- stunned -- as SHERIFF TAGGART runs for him -- 
SHERIFF TAGGART 
Meacham ushers people into the church as WALLS SHAKE, PEWS JUMP: 
INT. BLACKSMITH'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS 
DOC AND MARIA burst in, huddle under a window. Across the room, a YOUNG MAN clamps a hand over his TERRIFIED WIFE's mouth -- 
CRAAASFI! MORE RINGS SMASH THROUGH THE WALL, YANKING THE YOUNG 
COUPLE THROUGH IT! ANOTHER RING CLAMPS AROUND MARIA'S NECK! 
MARIA 
AYUDAMEEEEEEE! Doc LEAPS after her but her collar's LASSO CABLE whips out, TETHERING to a passing Speeder and she's RIPPED OUT THE DOOR -- 
DOC 
MARIA!!! 
EXT. BIRDCAGE THEATER - CELLAR - CONTINUOUS 
ELLA -- hurrying Emmett toward the theater's CELLAR DOOR, but a SPEEDER circles around and ROARS toward them -- ON JAKE. He SEES this -- and suddenly, to HIS surprise as much as OURS... HIS BRACELET ACTIVATES! METAL COMING TO LIFE, coiling up around his arm -- WHAT? HOW? -- as it becomes... 
A SMART GUN BLASTER WE PON! A HOLOGRAPHIC SCOPE MATERIALIZES, tracking that speeder as it DESCENDS on Ella and the mother and: 
BALLLLAMMMI THE BLASTER FIRES A PULSE, VAPORIZING THE SPEEDER 
MID-AIR! THE RECOIL HURTLES JAKE BACK 15 FEET, INTO A WALL. Ella reaches the CELLAR DOOR with Emmett. LOCKED. Sees a HATCHET in a stump -- rips it out and HAMMERS the lock to bits: 
ELLA Everyone inside! GO GO GO!! Ushering Emmett and TOWNSFOLK underground, PULLS the door SHUT -- 
EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS 
JAKE stumbles up... as a speeder FIRES A RING AT HIM. But reflexively, his WRIST WEAPON FIRES ANOTHER BLAST, vaporizing it! He looks down at the blaster: "Hell y ." Another speeder circles around -- KABOOM! The blaster's incredible firepower SPIRALS THE SPEEDER OUT OF CONTROL, it 
CRASHES INTO: 
INT. MEACHAM'S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS 
The speeder PLOWS through, parishioners flee -- the CHURCH BELL breaks from the BELL TOWER -- CRASHES DOWN ON THE SPEEDER -- 
EXT. TOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS 
As Jake keeps FIRING, the last speeders turn tail and RETREAT -- disappearing back INTO THE TORNADO as the cloud overhead OPENS UP and INHALES the swirling mass, which spirals to the heavens. ... GONE. The massive cloud seems to VAPORIZE and the DESERT SUN returns... debris flutters... smoke clears... And all... is... STILL. As our CAMERA RISES to reveal... HALF THE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN 
SUCKED INTO THE SKY. 
From the rubble, SURVIVORS EMERGE: EMMETT and ELLA from the cellar with inhabitants. DOLARHYDE. DOC. Al in SHOCK: 
DOC Maria -- oh God-- they t-took her-- What just...? MOANS, WAILS... desperate cries as people search for loved ones. JAKE'S BLASTER -- RETRACTS, folding in on itself -- shrinks down to size, reverting back into a BRACELET. He's stunned. So are the remaining townsfolk. DOLARHYDE is first to speak: 
DOLARHYDE Who the hell're ? 
NAT COLORADO He's the one who caged Percy. Dolarhyde starts MOVING toward Jake -- wild killer eyes -- 
DOLARHYDE Whatwere__tho_se__thinae? 
JAKE -- why're you asking m&?! Dolarhyde GRIPS Jake's arm -- THE BRACELET: 
DOLARHYDE This! Where'd you get this?! It was shooting the same light beams they were -- 
JAKE Let go of my wrist. 
DOLARHYDE -- I'm not lettin' go of nothin' til you tell me what the he-- KA-LLLANG!! Suddenly that CHURCH BELL comes HURTLING out of the church wreckage, PLOWS through debris. People scatter. And out of the church stumbles... AN ALIEN. 8 FT. TALL. Standing upright, limbs inverted -- limbs that DRAG, wounded, as people SCREAM and RUN and Jake and Dolarhyde can only stare, jaws dropped, and the monster LUNGES: WHUPWHUP -- something SPINNING through the air -- A HATCHET --- 
SCHLUCK!!!! -- EMBEDDING IN THE ALIEN'S HEAD! WHIP TO -- ELLA, hang iust hurled it. The alien lets out a DEATH RATTLE then FALLS FORWARD, the hatchet embedding deeper as it HITS THE DIRT. Holy SHIT. 
EMMETT Sorry, Father. Doc covers his face with his handkerchief as he explores... 
DOC Chet wall's partially collapsed... no familiar organs of any kind... 
DOLARHYDE 'course they're not familiar. Just look at this th-- 
SUDDENLY THE ALIEN'S ARM LASHES OUT -- claws SNAP OPEN and PIN Dolarhyde against the wall! Everyone tries to PRY the claws from his neck -- but the second Doc withdraws his hands from the alien's chest, its arm goes LIMP. Dolarhyde drops, GASPING... 
DOC Spinal reflex. And GRINS at Dolar's pain. But Meacham NOTICES something around Dolar's neck where the alien pinned him, like a ring of DUST: 
MEACHAM Something on your neck. Hold still. Meacham sweeps a little off Dolar's neck, rubs it between thumb and forefinger. The dust GLINTS under the kerosene lamp: 
MEACHAM (CONT'D) I'll be damned... gold. They check the creature's hand talons: GOLD FLAKES underneath 'em, and Lots of it. Colorado checks its taloned feet: 
NAT COLORADO Down here too. (looks to Dolar) This much ore... could only have come from a digging in a mine. That LANDS on everyone. but most especially ELLA. Who looks up to see Jake READING her in this moment. 
EMMETT In the ALIEN'S EYE is a SMALL FLASHING LIGHT. On/Off/On/Off in time with that BEEP BEEP BEEP. 
DOC Gimme my scalpel. In MACRO CU, DOC CUTS INTO THE EYE, WET SQUISHY SOUNDS as he pulls it from its socket, attached to a STRINGY OPTIC NERVE dripping with juice. Clamped to the nerve is a METALLIC ORB: -- he takes hold of the blinking orb. It FLARES to life, the light coalescing into a 3-D ARROW-LIKE HOLOGRAM. Confusion. Doc REMOVES it from the optic nerve and the hologram DISAPPEARS: 
DOLARHYDE Where'd it go? The hell'd you do? 
DOC Nothing, just pulled it off -- He reconnects it to the optic nerve, the hologram REAPPEARS: 
DOC (CONT'D) Only works when it's touching the creature. Colorado moves closer... rainbow light flickering across his face... 
NAT COLORADO I think... it's a compass. Look: (fiddles with tweezers) No matter how you move it, it points in the same direction. 
EMMETT Compasses point north. That's west. 
MEACHAM (realizing; to Jake) West's where 141 came from. ON JAKE. Another puzzle piece falling into place. 
EMMETT If you're right, what's it pointing to? 
ELLA The rest of 'em. 
(THEN) Be my guess. 
DOLARHYDE Then that's where I'm goin'. He SNAPS his PISTOL open, loading bullets: 
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) One of my ranchers said my herd disappeared into the sky. 'Til about ten minutes ago, I figured him for a liar. (SNAPS barrel closed) Nobody takes my cattle. 
MEACHAM Your b was taken too. A FLASH of something from Dolarhyde -- could that be EMOTION? But just as fast, it's GONE. Almost a THROWAWAY: 
DOLARHYDE I noticed. 
NAT COLORADO What if they're already dead? 
EMMETT They're not dead. 
ELLA Kid's right. If all they wanted was to kill us, they would've. 
DOLARHYDE Looked to me like... they were ropin' people. 
(THEN) Means they need 'em for something. Whatever it is, we can either stand here guessin'... or go find out. His eyes flash to Nat: "C'mon." And they EXIT. Everyone looks at each other, working up the courage to face what they know they must. Doc grabs his SHOTGUN, starts gathering shells: 
DOC If she's alive -- if there's even a 
CHANCE -- 
MEACHAM Lord hates a coward... but our bullets were useless against those things. Other than his wrist gizmo, we're outgunned and outnumbered. As one by one, they turn... to JAKE. Who until this point has been mostly SILENT. Observing. But now -- he's gone from enemy to potential savior in a heartbeat. 
JAKE Whoa, I got nothing to do with this -- 
ELLA You got everything to do with it. If you can remember where you got that thing -- 
MEACHAM That can't be good. The plummeting object HITS a distant dune, kicking up a SAND 
PLUME -- ROLLING TOWARD THEM -- 
DOLARHYDE Scatter. 
-- everyone runs their horses aside as the object BOUNCES over rocks -- then SLOWS... to a STOP. They STARE. Finally Dolarhyde kicks his horse forward slowly... DISMOUNTS, draws his GUN. What he sees is SHOCKING: It's an OVAL CAPSULE OF BLUE GOO, the outer layer some kind of TRANSLUCENT COCOON. Suspended within the murky Jell-o is a GE, DEC SHAPE. Motionless. UH-OH. The others draw guns too, converging around it in equal SHOCK and FEAR. But the thing doesn't MOVE. 
DOC Should we... open it? 
DOLARHYDE Should we open it? Hell NO we shouldn-- 
EMMETT -- oops -- -- and now we find Emmett's already POKING it with a stick, a Small TEAR in the cocoon's outer embryonic layer -- GOO leaks -- then it RUPTURES, EXPLODING as the horses REAR away, WHINNYING the goo spreads across the desert floor, thinning out. BEAT. Everyone wipes blue shit off their clothes as they come FACE-TO-FACE with the object inside, lying there on the ground: 
A COW. YES, A COW. Motionless. DEAD, in fact. A METAL TUBE jammed in its mouth, connected to a VALVE in the now-flaccid bubble's outer shell. Greavey notices a BRANDING on the cow's rump -- the letter "D": 
GREAVEY Boss... it's one'a yours. Dolarhyde's eyes NARROW. Emmett looks at Doc, SCARED: 
EMMETT Is-- is this what happened to my Pa? Doc dismounts. Moves to the cow's mouth and PULLS OUT THAT TUBE with a wet SQUISHING sound. Thinking it through: 
DOC This was stuck down its throat... to help it breathe. That means they wanted to keep it alive, Emmett. (forces a small smile) I'm sure your father is fine. But Doc's eyes aren't sure. Meacham looks back to the sky: 
MEACHAM Why'd they dump it? 
ELLA Whatever they needed from it, they must've got. 
(THEN) Gonna get dark soon, need to keep moving. She does. The others FOLLOW in a chilled daze. The last is DOLARHYDE, glancing back at his dead cow with angry eyes... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. RIDGE ABOVE VALLEY - DUSK 
Now our people APPEAR riding up a ridge... Dolarhyde shoots up a HAND, bringing the caravan to a STOP. Once again, SHOCK: 
EMMETT Ho-ly shit. BOOM UP to reveal a SURREAL SIGHT in the valley below: AGAMBLING RIVERBOAT. Nose buried in the sand, paddlewheels facing the sky, as if it'd been dropped from the clouds into the desert. Just like that cow. Off their LOOKS -- 
EXT. DESERT - THE PADDLEBOAT - MINUTES LATER 
TRACKING alongside of the TILTED PADDLEBOAT, our team rides around it. Trying to make SENSE. STENCILED on the stern is... 
DOC "Colorado Queen." 
(THEN) The river's two hundred miles from here. But Ella doesn't seem as impressed as the rest of them. In fact, her attention is drawn BEHIND them, to something coming up over the DUNES... the barest flicker of a smile -- 
ELLA Son of a bitch. IT'S JAKE ON HORSEBACK. Followed by another horse, with COLORADO in the saddle. Wrists tied but ALIVE. As Jake rides to a stop, he PUSHES Colorado off the horse -- the indian HITS the ground with a THUD as Jake levels Dolarhyde with HARD EYES: 
JAKE Your man got it in his head that he was s'posed to kill me. I'm holding onto his ear 'til he says sorry. 
As Colorado stumbles to his feet angrily, humiliated, Dolar notices his BLOODY EAR. The LOBE has been SHOT OFF. He looks up at Jake, half-angry, half-EMBARRASSED -- 
DOLARHYDE Why'd you let him live? Jake's hard-as-nails. DRIVEN now -- 
JAKE Gonna need him. He rides past Dolar to Ella. Stops. Says, simply: 
JAKE (CONT'D) Nice boat. (then... SNIFFS) What's that smell? 
ELLA That'd be me. He realizes her shirt's caked in the BLUE GOO from the cow. 
JAKE Why're you blue? 
ELLA 
(DRYLY) Cause I missed ya. Their look HOLDS. A MOMENT. Something REAL between them. 
DOLARHYDE We better keep movin'. A THUNDERCRACK. On the horizon, sheets of RAIN. 
ELLA Why didn't you say anything? 
JAKE Givin' you privacy. She throws her shirt on, but her skin's wet and the shirt glues to her, celebrating her shape in a way that can't be ignored. Jake tosses her his jacket. As she slips it on, she notices a bottle of WHISKEY on the table... and the PHOTOGRAPH OF ALICE. 
ELLA . she's pretty. (Jake says NOTHING) Who was she? Jake's quiet. DARK. Intense emotion, intensely suppressed: 
JAKE only thing I know's her name was Alice... 
(THEN; DISTANT) And she's dead. Ella looks up at him. INTO him -- 
ELLA Maybe you loved her. Jake shakes his head, sort of mumble/chuckles in RESISTANCE: 
JAKE All you women are the same -- Always wanna make it about Goddamn "love." 
ELLA 
(A BEAT) Trust me, Lonergan. I'm not the same. There is a force -- a strength about this woman -- that he connects with. But remains, true to character, ALOOF: 
JAKE Don't matter. She takes a step closer. Soft. Intimate. 
ELLA So what dj= matter? Jake just looks at her. Then, lifts the cheroot to his lips, the FLARE of its tip casting him in a demonic light... 
JAKE What matters is I find the thing that killed her. (dark as hell) And make it pay. And now, he leans forward with a focused LOOK... holds up his 
BRACELET: 
JAKE (CONT'D) Where'd you see this before? A beat. Ella -- somehow CONTAINED -- opens her mouth to lie. But he cuts her off -- 
JAKE (CONT'D) -- and don't lie to me. You wouldn't've asked me if you didn't recognize it. Ella tightens. PAIN in her eyes. And Jake REALIZES: 
JAKE (CONT'D) Those things... they the ones who put those marks on your back? She swallows: a mixture of SHAME that he's found her out... and ANGER at what was done to her. 
ELLA They took my people. Destroyed where I'm from. 
JAKE Where's that? 
ELLA North of here. Been trackin' 'em ever since, town to town. Best I figure, they're hidin' in a mine. Jake CONSIDERS all this. Softens a little: 
JAKE Maybe if you'd told me the truth instead of throwin' rocks at me -- 
ELLA -- what, you would've stuck around? Bullshit. I couldn't've turned you away from what you had to do, any more than I could've stopped these people from going after their kin. 
(BEAT) Truth ain't worth a damn, Jake... and we're gonna need all the guns we can get. Their look HOLDS... until Jake SMIRKS. Likes her style: 
JAKE So that's the only reason you wanted me to come with you? Cause of my gun? There's a pause... then Ella SMIRKS back: 
ELLA No, not your gun. 
(BEAT) What you do with it. Among the many things these two ate feeling -- both separately and together -- the one that pops right now is ATTRACTION. Confusing as it is for him. The pregnant moment LINGERS... Until Happy suddenly starts to GROWWWWL, sensing something outside. ANOTHER CRACK OF THUNDER as: 
INT. STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The horses STAMP NERVOUSLY out the window as Greavey and the rest of Dolarhyde's men (COBBETT and 4 others) HUDDLE in secret conference -- whispers that sound a lot like MUTINY -- 
GREAVEY What the hell're we doin' here? We should be ridin' in the opposite direction of those things -- 
COBBETT We do that, the old man's likely to shoot us himself. Only way outta this is -- And suddenly. Greavey SNIFFS the air, FROWNS: 
GREAVEY . what's that smell? -- as they TURN to the deck where the creature lays... ALL THEY 
FIND IS AN EMPTY TARP FLAPPING AIMLESSLY: 
COBBETT 
AW SH-- LIGHTNING FLASHES, illuminating the ship -- and als4THE ALIEN behind them. a coiled mass clinging spiderlike to the ceiling!!! Its arm WHIPS out, noosing around Cobbett -- LIFTS HIM off his feet -- SLAMS HIM into the ceiling -- TOSSES HIM like a ragdoll: The men SHOUT -- a PAIR OF RAZOR SHARP CANINES extrude from the alien then it SPRINGS -- SLICING THROUGH TWO MEN AT ONCE -- GREAVEY and 2 others manage to SCRAMBLE AWAY: 
JAKE -- WE GOTTA GO M! But Jake can't let go -- FURY -- HEARTBREAK -- Doc PULLS HIM away -- Jake SNAGS THE CRUCIFIX off Meacham's neck as he's forced OUT, leaving Meacham's body to be CONSUMED BY FLAMES -- 
EXT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - DESERT - NIGHT 
The boat is a BALL OF FIRE in the pouring rain, as what remains of our heroes stumble out, COUGHING, devastated... Jake, Doc, Dolarhyde, Colorado, Greavey, 2 GUNMEN... and Ella and Happy atop a DUNE, following a TRAIL OF FLUORESCENT ORANGE BLOOD streaking into the desert. Happy BARKING MADLY. Ella drops to a knee, touches the orange blood as it WASHES AWAY in the rain: 
ELLA 
RAIN'S GONNA COVER ITS TRACKS! 
NAT COLORADO That thing... was dead... it was d-ead... DOLARHYDE, RAIN pouring down his face... VULNERABLE and GUILTY: 
DOLARHYDE I couldn't stop it -- It just... grabbed the kid. ON JAKE. Rage-filled against the flames... Meacham's CRUCIFIX in his hared, as his FIST closes around it. Looks up, HARDCORE: 
JAKE Then we'd better get him back. 
SMASH TO: 
INT. STALACTITE CAVERN - NIGHT 
STALACTITES loom from the ceiling -- BAM! EMMETT is DROPPED on the floor of a sinister cave -- scrambles back from THE ALIEN: 
EMMETT Damn. You are one ugly bastar-- PSST! The alien spits a RESIN GOB on Emmett's mouth -- PSST PSST! More gobs PIN his limbs to the wall. Emmett can't move -- can't speak -- eyes WIDE and TERRIFIED -- The creature looks down at an ARMOR PLATE on its bicep. Touches a series of keys and the armor spits out what looks like... .. a small RUBIK'S CUBE made of some alien alloy. The creature casually TOSSES IT in the air where it FLOATS and starts to SPIN -- as it does, its sides FLIP AND TURN (like a Rubik's Cube) -- emitting HIGH-PITCHED SONAR BEEPS: This thing's some kind of HOMING BEACON. Off Emmett's WIDE, GAPING EYES... 
EXT. DESERT PLAINS - SUNRISE 
Our people RIDE FAST against the rising sun, on the hunt for Emmett. Colorado REARS his horse, kneels by a trace of ORANGE BLOOD on some rocks. 
NAT COLORADO (looks off --) West. Greavey and the others share a LOOK. E o Turn to Dolar -- 
GREAVEY Boss, only took one of them things to kill four of us. We got no chance here. Dolarhyde BURNS -- knowing he's being ABANDONED -- 
DOLARHYDE You're a goddamn coward. (to the others) You work for me, dammit. You're my m e 1 1 Qyees. And Greavey, finally FREE to speak his mind, says SPITEFULLY: 
GREAVEY Fine line between a coward and a fool. The men turn tail and RIDE AWAY. Dolarhyde SHOUTS after them -- 
DOLARHYDE You're all FIRED! Doc takes the opportunity to TWIST the knife: 
DOC Looks like they finally found something to be more scared of than you. Dolarhyde feels his world CRUMBLING away man by man... Ella trots alongside Jake, who's staring at that DARK CLOUD MASS overhead with a bad feeling: 
JAKE Clouds've been moving east since sun- up... 'cept that one. ON ELLA. We SENSE she knows something, something more she isn't saying. SNAPS her reins and they RIDE OFF: 
INT. BOX CANYON - CONTINUOUS 
As the group gallops into a BOX CANYON, Happy starts BARKING MADLY -- the horses SLOW -- 
ELLA 
SOMETHING'S WRON-- BLAMBLAN1111 GUNSHOTS from above suddenly PEPPER the ground -- the horses REAR and KICK UP, startled -- A DOZEN FIGURES ON THE CLIFFS ALL AROUND THEM. Badass OUTLAWS with RIFLES aimed at our heroes. One of them CALLS DOWN: 
OUTLAW GUNMAN 
EVERYBODY DRAW YOUR GUNS SLOW AND TOSS 
'EM ON THE GODDAMNED GROUNDI 
SHIT. SLOWLY, Jake draws his gun... tosses it. Now the rest of them. As they SEE -- TWO RIDERS -- incoming -- from the other end of the canyon. Rifles aimed and ready. Happy GROWLS... One of the outlaws knocks back the hammer on his rifle -- 
OUTLAW I say we just shoot 'em and take their-- But the words catch in his throat as his EYES WIDEN: 
OUTLAW (CONT'D) . Boss? Sure enough, they're looking right at (BRONC -JAKE. Both outlaws and HUNT) lower their guns, hostility replaced by SURPRISE: 
HUNT What the hell you doin' back here, Lonergan? Oh, Christ. This is JAKE'S gang. ON DOLARHYDE. ELLA. COLORADO. All registering it. And JAKE, of course, doesn't REMEMBER these men as Bronc dismounts, NERVOUS: 
BRONC Jesus, Boss... Creek's gonna shit when he sees you. (then; re: the others) And who the hell're they? ON JAKE. Now does he handle this? Ht:nt rides up next to him, SUSPICIOUS, and for reasons yet to be known, UNFRIENDLY -- 
CREEK JOHNSON They're not going anywhere with you. Creek's heard enough. Strides forward, a direct CHALLENGE: 
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) You got some balls on you -- walkin' outta here a week ago sayin' what you said and doin' what you did and then ridin' back in here and givin orders. Just who the hell do you think you are? The IRONY of the question isn't lost on Jake, as Creek walks right up to Ella. CLOSE. Violates her space: studies her with a mixture of curiosity and CONTEMPT. 
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) So. Are you her? 
ELLA Am I who? 
CREEK JOHNSON The whore Jake quit this gang for. OH. Another piece of the puzzle falls into place -- Jake's eyes SNAP to Ella as they both REALIZE... the men think she's " e." Jake does his best to stay cool, meets Creek's stare: 
JAKE Watch your mouth, Creek. 
CREEK JOHNSON Or what? These boys are with = now. jID in charge. You may be fast, but you are goddamned outgunned. ON JAKE. OUR HEROES. Shit. Jake turns to the men -- 
JAKE That a fact, Boys? But Creek doesn't wait for them to respond: 
CREEK JOHNSON Put your guns on the whore. He so much as twitches, blow her brains out her ear. AT ONCE, 10 GUNS ARE LEVELED AT ELLA'S HEAD. No doubt as to who the men are LOYAL to. But Jake locks into Creek, UNFLINCHING: 
JAKE Call her a whore again, that'll be the last word you ever say. 
CREEK JOHNSON You ain't in no position to make threats, asshole. Hunt: take his gun. Hunt reluctantly scrambles over to Jake, oh-so-carefully pulls the PISTOL from Jake's holster: 
HUNT Sorry, Boss... nothin' personal. Creek now turns to BULL MCCADE, roughly the size of a BARN. 
CREEK JOHNSON Put him down, Bull. And Jake barely has time to react as Bull lets fly with a JAWBREAKING HAYMAKER that about knocks Jake out of his BOOTSI Dolarhyde and Colorado WINCE as Jake hits the dirt with a THUD -- Creek striding over, cock of the walk, LEANS over him: 
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) Where the hell's our gold. Jake? "Gold?" Jake SPITS BLOOD, defiant: 
JAKE Don't remember. Creek NODS to Bull: SMASH! Another devastating BLOW. ON ELLA -- at GUNPOINT. Wishing she could intervene. DOC too. 
CREEK JOHNSON Well I _dg remember you tellin' us you was leavin' us high and dry because you were in love... You just left out the part about taking half our goddamned haul from the Yuma Bank. So I'm gonna ask you one last time -- Where. Is. Our. Gold? -- WHAM! Bull PUNCHES Jake so hard he FLIES OFF HIS FEET: 
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) Man can't run away from who he ja, Lonergan... you really think you could go straight just cause you were fool enough to fall in love with some woman? WHAM! Bull PUNCHES Jake back into oblivion, and on the HIT we: MEMORY FLASECUTi PEACEFUL SILENCE -- two FACES staring at each other across a pillow -- Jake and ALICE, naked, in a WHOREHOUSE 
BEDROOM SOMEWHERE: 
ALICE You sure you wanna give it all up? ON JAKE. Clearly TORN. But just as clearly, in LOVE. 
JAKE What about you? Once we're gone, you ain't ever comin' back. She touches his face so gently. And whispers: 
ALICE You're the first person ever believed I was better than this place... so I gotta believe in y=. (and she KISSES him) You're a good man, Jake Lonergan. PRESENT: as the words "Good Man" ECHO back to Jake. Stir=g_ ]1â1n as Creek GRABS Jake's hair and YANKS BACK, rears up a fist: 
CREEK JOHNSON You figgered you could steal from us? All that gold was yours to take co you could go off and start a new life? Creek's next PUNCH takes us to another: TORY FLASECUTI REPLAY -- Jake and Alice in the cabin -- he drops the SADDLEBAG -- it CLINKS to the floor. She's worried: 
ALICE Your boys'ii come after you. 
JAKE (dark, determined) Let 'em come. BACK TO PRESENT -- as now Jake UNDERSTANDS the context of this moment -- what they were saying to each other -- He looks up at Creek, BEATEN AND BUSTED UP: 
JAKE (CONT'D) Okay... okay, I remember now... ("fuck you" grin) Demons stole your gold, Creek. But when you get to hell, you can ask for it back. 
CREEK JOHNSON 
(TSK'S) Okay then. That's the way you wanna do this... 
(TURNS) Kill the whore. ON THE GANG. As they all cock their guns -- Aimed at Ella -- This is IT -- JAKE -- slowly lifts his head, suddenly RAGE-FILLED as -- 
HIS WRIST BRACELET ACTIVATES! BLAMMMM11! A SEARING PULSE BLAST 
FIRES, VAPORIZING CREEK JUST BEFORE HE PULLS THE TRIGGER! EVERYONE'S FACES. Holy shit. Jake spits on the around between the SMOKING BOOTS that formerly belonged to Creek: 
JAKE Told you not to call her that. ON JAKE. Pure KILLER. As he turns his weapon on the rest of the (awestruck) gang -- through BLOODY TEETH: 
JAKE (CONT'D) You're all riding with me. Any one of you decides otherwise? So help me God, I'll kill you where you stand. 
(AND THEN) I'm j2acj& and I'M in goddamne.d The gang quickly flips: "Absolutely, Jake/ Whatever you say, Boss..." Jake turns to the speechless Bull McCade and KICKS HIM IN THE BALLS as hard as he can, doubling him over. Now he meets eyes with ELLA. She can't help SMIRKING, grateful. DOC. Is the only one NOT looking at Jake. His attention drawn toward a SOUND coming from the distant DUNES -- 
Too late: KA-CHANK! The collar CLAMPS her neck, RIPPING ELLA OFF HER HORSE! The CABLE snaps back and attaches to the hovercraft as it ZIPS by, DRAGGING ELLA BACKWARD LIKE A WATER 
SKIER BEHIND A SPEEDBOAT! ON JAKE -- FURY -- HIS BRACELET ACTIVATES! And there's a LOGIC here we'll come to realize, as he KICKS his horse into a gallop: 
JAKE (CONT'D) 
HYAA! 
EXT. DESERT - CONTINUOUS 
ELLA'S DRAGGED BEHIND THE SPEEDER. Hands GRASPING at the magnetic collar as it HALF-CHOKES HER, yet keeps her upper body SUSPENDED just oft the ground while her heels BOUNCE HARSHLY -- 
JAKE ON THE HORSE Riding hard -- aims his BLASTER, trying to get a TARGET on the CABLE linking Ella's collar to the speeder -- fires -- MISSES! The Slaver TILTS VERTICAL to fly through a narrow CANYON ENTRANCE as Ella's fingers reach wildly for THE BOWIE KNIFE on her belt. She starts CUTTING THE CABLE, trying to FREE HERSELF: WHOOSH! The speeder BLASTS out the other side of the canyon, Jake still in pursuit but suddenly... 
THE UNION PACIFIC LOCOMOTIVE IS CURVING AROUND A CORNER, RACING RIGHT FOR THEM! This is the train Jake's gang was gonna rob! 
INT. UNION PACIFIC EXPRESS CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Two PINKERTONS sit by a SAFE. LOOK UP at an unidentified ROAR -- 
PINKERTON #1 You hear.that? 
PINKERTON #2 How many times I gotta tell you, Leonard. No one'd be stupid enough to rob this tr-- 
SWWWWWM. IN THE WINDOW BEHIND THEM... THE SPEEDER BLASTS BY. 
GOING AGAINST THE TRAIN, ELLA BOUNCING BEHIND IT. When the Pinkertons SNAP around, Ella's GONE... but now they SEE JAKE -- ON HORSEBACK -- FLASHING PAST in pursuit! 
PINKERTON #2 (CONT'D) 1 stand corrected. They DRAW GUNS, running to see what's happening and -- 
EXT. UNION PACIFIC TRAIN - KID AIR AT 80 MPH - CONTINUOUS 
As the speeder SKIMS alongside the train, ELLA keeps struggling painfully to CUT HER COLLAR CABLE. Jake FIRES again, MISSES the cable but DETONATES THE SIDE OF A TRAIN CAR: 
INT. UNION PACIFIC - TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS 
The wall EXPLODES INWARD on the Pinkertons -- hurt, but ALIVE -- 
EXT. UNION PACIFIC TRAIN - CONTINUOUS 
The speeder's SHAKEN. The Slaver GROWLS as he fights for balance. Reaches the TRAIN'S END, skims past the caboose and -- 
DAMNIT. THE SLAVER ARCS BACK AROUND IN A WIDE U-TURN, SLOTTING 
IN FOR COVER BEHIND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TMINâ¢,=_`T1.2AVF.LLING,.J 
THE SAME DIRECTION NOW! 
ELLA'S FLUNG WILDLY BY THE HAIRPIN TURN! SHE DROPS THE KNIFE, 
IT CLATTERS AWAY! HER ONLY MEANS OF ESCAPE GONE! 
JAKE'S POV: Through a slot between boxcars, the speeder BLURS in the opposite direction. Up ahead comes the CABOOSE. No more TRAIN: Thinking FAST, Jake LEAPS off his horse -- CATCHES A LADDER RUNG ON THE CABOOSE'. Teeth gritted, starts to CLIMB up onto: 
EXT. TOP OF UNION PACIFIC TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Jake JUMPS from car to car -- over LOGS in a TENDER CAR -- BLAM BLAM!!! The PINKERTONS are climbing to the roof, WEAPONS FIRING -- Jake loses footing, ROLLING off the side -- 
EXT. SIDE OF TRAIN - CONTINUOUS 
-- but CATCHES another ladder rung and he DANGLES, looks DOWN: 
ELLA IS RIGHT UNDER HIM, DRAGGING BEHIND THE SPEEDER! HE 
REACHES OUT -- 
SOP. DON'T DO THIS. SURPRISED looks from just about everyone in the camp (besides Colorado) as we realize Dolarhyde just spoke APA ON GREY WOLF -- INTRIGUED as he approaches Dolarhyde: 
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) How is it that you speak our language? 
UOLARHYUE (SUBTITLE) Because I'm a damn genius. Grey Wolf's fascinated this man has the audacity to be a WISEASS given his circumstances. Turns to the Brave with the tomahawk -- 
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Forget about quick. Make him feel it. The Brave NODS, RAISES the Tomahawk again, but Dolar interrupts: 
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) Two hundred head of cattle! Grey Wolf holds up his hand, halting the Brave's death blow -- 
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) (CONT'D) I'll have two hundred head of cattle u_a here in a day's time if you let me go. ON GREY WOLF. Considering this. 
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) And how do I know you'll come back? Dolarhyde nods to Colorado -- 
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) You can keep my associate here. if I don ' t come back, you can kill him. Colorado REACTS. He's the only one here who knows what the hell these two are saying to each other as Grey Wolf approaches Dolar, looks right INTO HIM -- 
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Why should I believe that you even care about this man? Dolarhyde's eyes flash EMOTION. Quickly bottled. Then: 
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) Because he's my son. Wow. Didn't see that one coming. Grey Wolf levels Colorado with those unyielding eyes -- 
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Is this true? And Colorado answers in ENGLISH, for the benefit of the others: 
COLORADO Yeah... he's my father. REACTIONS. JAKE. EMMETT. DOC. Stunned silence. And so: 
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Three hundred head. Dolar looks to Colorado, who won't meet his eyes. His FATHER's eyes. Turns back to Grey Wolf, HARD -- 
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) Two fifty. HOLD ON GREY WOLF for a beat. Then -- 
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Cut him loose. The Brave does exactly that. Dolar's FREE to go... 
EMMETT Hey! What about =?!? ON DOLAR. A FLASH of regret. But it's gone fast. 
DOLARHYDE What about you, kid? And he just walks out of the camp, leaving his son behind... GONE. And now, it's back to business -- 
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Kill all of them except the half-breed. Our people are GRABBED. Jake's yanked forward, PINNED DOWN -- a Brave raises a HATCHET to kill Jake, who glares back with lunatic eyes. Ready to die. Almost wanting it: 
JAKE What're you waiting for, asshole? DO IT. And as Jake's about to MEET HIS DEATH: 
FWOOM! THE PYRE SUDDENLY BILLOWS, TURNING FROM ORANGE TO GREEN 
TO WHITE -- EVERYONE BACKS AWAY AS -- 
ELLA EMERGES FROM THE PYRE. WRAPPED IN A CAUL OF FIRE AND LIGHTI Except she isn't exactly Ella. She's a HUMANOID, incredibly close to us in physical appearance, her features acutely feminine, yet... ALJM. PANDEMONIUM. The Apache kneel in prostration, DROPPING weapons as flames DISSIPATE off Ella's backlit form. Her skin RETURNS to human flesh-tone. Hair too. When she finally STOPS, she looks like the ELLA we've come to know and love. STANDS there: 
ELLA . what... happened? ON JAKE. Holy. SHIT. Everyone else equally STUNNED. 
EMMETT You... died. 
Ella looks around. Fifty dumbstruck faces staring at her. 
ELLA 
(QUIETLY; CAUGHT) . oh. OFF ELLA, who's got a helluva lot to explain -- 
INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT 
A deerskin shirt slips down over Ella's naked body.' A dark breechcloth is tied. She TURNS to us.: beautiful as ever. 
EXT. TEEPEE - NIGHT 
Ella emerges to find... JAKE. Standing outside.the teepee. HARD. And for a long moment, nothing is said. Until she takes a step TOWARD him: 
ELLA If I'd told you on the boat, you never would'a trusted me -- -- but he takes a step BACK. If he's relieved she's alive, he isn't showing it: 
JAKE Did you hear what I said? 
(STEPS CLOSER) Even with your memory wiped, your instincts kicked in -- 
(HIS BRACELET:) That's how it works, Jake, the bracelet reads your impulse -- you wanna fight, it reacts. Somehow you took it off one of 'em... don't you remember any of it? ON JAKE. Deeply STIRRED. As he looks down at the BRACELET and: MEMORY FLASBCUTSI REPLAY POV as we're HELD DOWN in that CAVE the TERRIFYING OCULAR PROBE lowers right in front of our eyes One of the ALIENS starts to activate the probe -- it begins to FLASH STEADILY -- HYPNOTICALLY -- PUvTNG OUR MIND -- But our arm manages to BREAK FREE -- a BLADE hidden in our sleeve -- WE SLASH OFF THE. ALIEN'S HAND -- GRAB THE BRACELET off its severed limb -- it COILS around our wrist and ACTIVATES: BLAM SLAM! We BLAST the creature to oblivion -- we're FREE! JAKE IN PRESENT -- Eyes ALIVE with MEMORY: 
JAKE I-- I blasted my way out... MEMORY FLASHCUTI REPLAY POV as we RUN through the cavern -- ESCAPE -- a LIGHT at the end of the tunnel -- BLINDING SUN hits us as we emerge -- our eyes ADJUST to see: 
That STRANGE ROCK FORMATION HIGH ABOVE on the edge of a CANYON -- the STONE TOWER pointing to heaven -- JAKE IN PRESENT: The sequencing is COMPLETE for him now: 
JAKE (CONT'D) I remember seeing a tower... made of stone... on the rim of a canyon... Upon hearing that, Grey Wolf suddenly speaks in animated gestures, pointing North. Colorado REACTS: 
ELLA What? What's he sayin'?!? Colorado turns to Jake, a flicker of HOPE: 
COLORADO That rock you're talkin' about... he- knows where it is. 
INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - NIGHT 
The Slaver ENTERS the gloom of an UNDERGROUND CAVERN. Two ALIENS melt from the dark to greet him with frightening HISSES. SENTRIES. We HOLD on the walls as something GLITTERS: GOLD. 
INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN - SOMEWHERE 
CLOSE ON SHERIFF TAGGART'S REFLECTION IN MURKY WATER. As we TILT UP to reveal him hanging UPSIDE DOWN. Eyes flutter open. He's seen better days. Dazed. Turns his head slightly... 
SHERIFF TAGGART You... all right...? DRIFTING over to see MARIA. Gravity PULLING her hair downward. Groggy. Mostly SCARED: 
MARIA 
(BRAVE FACE) . Fantastic. You? 
CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS, ROTATING 180 DEGREES, TO REVEAL THEY'RE STUCK TO THE CEILING OVER A WATER GROTTO. The whole town of Absolution is here... a hundred others from the now-cratered town of Winfield's Landing, feet embedded in the ORANGE RESIN. Suddenly, PERCY DOLARHYDE sees a TERRIFYING SHADOW spread across the wall -- what looks like a HUGE, COILING SNAKE: 
PERCY DOLARHYDE 
H-- HEY!!! THE HELL'S THA--?! -- but what comes around the corner is a LONG METAL TENTACLE: 
A SCANNING MECHANISM on its tip shoots out a blue triangular beam -- itemizing specimens -- SELECTING ONE: SHERIFF TAGGART. Mechanized TALONS open up -- Taggart SCREAMS as he's PLUCKED from the ceiling like an apple from a TREE: 
DEPUTY CHARLIE WADE 
KYLE!!!! ANOTHER METAL TENTACLE slithers in and GRABS WADE -- swinging our men across the cavern where we reveal... . the tentacles are attached to a TERRIFYING ALIEN MACHINE. Taggart and Wade are PINNED DOWN on what looks like an operating table. As they thrash, RESTRAINING CLAMPS enfold their skulls. An OCULAR PROBE looms _Q.Xpr. them, This is the image _ e.'_A_beM1_ seeing! This is what haRpened to him before he escaRe ! WORKER-BEE ALIENS adjusts the device over their eyes -- INSTANT X-RAYS read their retinas -- HYPNOTIC -- as the men grow DOCILE and LIMP despite their fight and -- FLASHFLASHTLASHI The probe has ERASED THEIR MINDS. Catatonic stares. Now the machine arms slip the men into separate TRANSLUCENT CAPSULES. METAL BREATHING TUBES are implanted down their throats as the capsules begin to fill with a THICK, BLUE LIQUID. This is the same blue goo -- a protective gel -- that housed the COW in that jettisoned cocoon in the desert. More Worker Bees load the cocoons into TRANSPORT SHUTTLECRAFTS. We see containment holds filled with BLEATING COWS and REARING HORSES... all going through a similar cocooning process. All of this is overseen by THE SLAVER, who stalks up a ramp behind the cocoons. The craft HUMS to life, undergear retracting as it ROARS OFF down the tunnel... 
EXT. CANYON RIM - DANN 
Our people ride up a rocky slope with a few Apaches. Grey Wolf looks around and SPEAKS, Colorado translates: 
NAT COLORADO This is Kiowa land, their sister tribe. As they near the bluff, Jake sees the STONE TOWER. Dismounts: 
JAKE That's it. As they near the bluff, they hear the growing sound of that MACHINERY. Everyone dips low, peering over to see... 
What looks a whole lot like a CAVALRY FORT in the canyon below, amid a network of trenches and underground tunnels. Except this fortress is made of some kind of ALIEN ALLOY, glowing impossibly bright as its steel surface reflects the rising sun. DRILLING MACHINES are chewing deep into the earth, mining for 
GOLD -- THESE ARE THE SAME DRILLS THAT LANDED IN OUR OPENING. Massive receptacles are FILLED with HUGE CHUNKS. ALIENS move in and out, working, as if from an ant hive. 
DOC Holy Jesus. Like a damn fort. Grey Wolf looks to his men, GRAVE, CRESTFALLEN as he realizes: 
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) The Kiowa... they were taken too. Suddenly, the ROOF of the steel structure blossoms open like a CHROME LOTUS... and WHOOSH! The SHUTTLE TRANSPORT flies out of the canyon, RISING into the dawn sky... 
ELLA Transports. Way they get people and gold back and forth to the ship. 
DOC Place is crawling with those things. We'll never even get close. Grey Wolf SPEAKS -- 
NAT COLORADO He says there's a back way in... The Twin Rivers run underneath this whole canyon. Limestone tunnels up by the falls, couple miles East. Lead right down there. Jake looks to the SKY. DARK. DETERMINED. 
JAKE The Slaver... he's up in that big cloud? Ella nods, HARD. Off their SHARED DETERMINATION, our SCORE rises. A DRUM CADENCE that suggests a MISSION starting to form: 
EXT. APACHE CAMP - DAY 
ELLA That's a nice thing... what you said to the boy. I didn't know better, I'd say you got yourself a sweet side. She smiles. But Jake turns to her -- deadly serious: 
JAKE There's nothin' sweet about me. I told that kid what he needed to hear so he wouldn't get in my damn way. All I care about is killin' that thing. And Ella reacts to the DARKNESS in his voice. Shakes her head: 
ELLA I don't believe that. 
JAKE Well believe it. I was playing a part. (straight at her) Just like you were. He CRACKS the reins, riding ahead. HOLD ON ELLA... who finally follows as they all ride out and MUSIC SOARS: 
EXT. DESERT PLAINS - CONTINUOUS 
JAKE, ELLA, COLORADO, DOC AND THE APACHE WARRIORS RIDE LIKE HELL 
TOWARD THEIR FATE, SLAMMING RIGHT INTO LENS -- AND WE MATCH TO: 
EXT. DOLARHYDE'S RANCH - DAY 
THUNDERING HOOVES -- but it's DOLARHYDE on his horse. REARS near the SERVANTS QUARTERS -- moving FAST toward a small hut: A HATCHET is embedded in a wood pile. Dolarhyde YANKS it out. 
INT. SERVANTS' QUARTERS - DAY 
The APACHE WOMAN we saw in the drawn-and-quartered scene earlier is washing clothes on a basin board. She turns as -- Dolarhyde ENTERS. A menacing figure with a blade in the doorway. She stands, ALERT -- in SUBTITLED APACHE: 
THE WOMAN (SUBTITLE) What are you doing? Without response, he levels the axe and SLAMS it down on the FLOORBOARDS. Wood chips SPRAY until a GASH is opened. Dolar REACHES in... pulling out a CANVAS BAG. A few COINS spill out... COLD. He picks them up -- looks at the woman: 
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) Need it to save Nat. 
And now her worry becomes FEAR; English now: 
THE WOMAN Is he okay? 
DOLARHYDE He's gonna be. A storm of mixed emotions in his eyes. That stoic Dolarhyde veneer starts to CRACK... just a hint... as the woman MOVES to him... and TOUCHES his face. And he lets her. WHOA. We realize: this woman is COLORADO'S MOTHER. Dolarhyde, for all his wicked bluster, LOVES AN APACHE. 
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) I won't let anything happen to him, Jenny. 
THE WOMAN 
(SOFTLY) Come back to me. With that, he's GONE with the gold. Leaving her full of DREAD. 
EXT. TWIN RIVER FALLS - CAVERN ENTRANCE - DAY 
A CASCADING WATERFALL flows over rock face into the TWIN RIVERS. The water curtain covers a CAVERN ENTRANCE. The back way in. Jake, Ella, Doc, Colorado and the Apaches cross slippery rocks and push through the water... 
INT. LIMESTONE CAVERN - CONTINUOUS 
Behind the curtain, they shake off the wet and remove TORCHES from waterproof buffalo-hide pouches. FIRELIGHT as our team creeps along in a column. TENSE. Jake glances at Colorado: 
JAKE You and Percy're brothers, huh? 
NAT COLORADO ... half. 
JAKE So... your momma and Dolarhyde--- 
NAT COLORADO We friends now? Last I checked, you shot my ear off. 
JAKE (a beat; then) Want it back? 
Colorado GRUMBLES, pushes ahead of Jake... 
EXT. FORT HUACHUCA - MORNING 
A BUZZARD picks at the EAR of a DEAD GANG MEMBER. More birds scavenge the dismembered remains of JAKE'S CREW as the rest of its LIVING MEMBERS -- roughly 30 -- tend wounds and get ready to move on. One of them looks up... .. and sees an INCOMING RIDER on the horizon: 
OUTLAW 
BRONC! BRONC and HUNT look up. Draws their GUNS. So does the rest of the gang... until they see the rider's waving a WHITE FLAG. As he comes closer -- they realize it's DOLARHYDE: 
She cranks back and the ship PITCHES upward -- 
INT. TRANSPORT SHUTTLE - OVER THE CANYON - CONTINUOUS 
The shuttle BURSTS OUT into the canyon and skates the rim. Jake fights the G-FORCES and teeth-rattling TURBULENCE as -- The craft keeps spiralling UP UP toward... THE OMINOUS CLOUD. As we come closer, an IMPOSSIBLY BLUE GLOW blinds us: 
EXT. UPPER CLOUD LAYER - CONTINUOUS 
The shuttle BLASTS through the upper cloud layer, to reveal... 
THE ALIEN SCOUT -SHIP. ENORMOUS AND THREATENING, like a BLACK METAL CLAW. Cloud banks encircle the ship as if it were the eye of a hurricane. ON ELLA. Like ice down her spine... as we drift back to JAKE. Trying to find a word to DESCRIBE this thing. Finally: 
JAKE Sheee-it. 
INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS 
The rest of our heroes GALLOP FAST out the criss-crossing tunnels -- KA-CHINNNG! Apaches are CLAMPED WITH STEEL COLLARS and YANKED off their horses as the SPEEDERS roar in from behind! Colorado VEERS toward a LIGHT as Doc ignites a molotov and they: 
INT. ALIEN FORT - CANYON - CONTINUOUS 
GALLOP Out into daylight, rigb-t_through the CENTER of the fort -- Doc THROWS his molotov and BOOM!!! Aliens go FLYING, on fire! Doc throws another MOLOTOV, clearing a path for Colorado to RIDE HARD for the fort's 30 FT. STEEL ENTRY GATES... which start SWINGING CLOSED to trap them! But at the LAST SECOND, the horse SLIPS THROUGH the narrow opening as it THUNDERS CLOSED. Now the aliens are pissed off: 
EXT. ALIEN FORT - CONTINUOUS 
They start spilling over the fort walls in pursuit. A few mount SPEEDERS and launch as our guys ride DOWN THE CANYON TRENCH: 
,INT. CANYON TRENCH - CONTINUOUS 
Colorado and Doc ZIG-ZAG around CURVES -- like mice navigatinga maze, so the speeders can't get a clear shot: 
DOC They're gaining on us! 
NAT COLORADO That's the point! And just when it looks like Doc and Colorado are GONERS... BOOM! An EXPLOSION rocks the canyon as something HURTLES DOWN from above -- WHISKEY MOLOTOVS fired from the handmade CATAPULTS. BOOM! BOOM! Aliens are VAPORIZED, SHRIEKING! A cloudburst of FLAMING ARROWS brightens the sky as 20 APACHES RISE UP along the canyon rims: A AMBUSH! An ASSEMBLY LINE OF SQUAWS works like a drill team, soaking WHISKEY RAGS and wrapping arrows. Among them, EMMETT and HAPPY! The kid pocks an arrow like a damn EXPERT -- IGNITES it -- lets it FLY -- WHOOSH! It SKEWERS a speeder pilot who BURSTS INTO FLAMES, the speeder CORKSCREWS into another one, both EXPLODING: 
EMMETT 
YEAHHHHH!!! 
THE ALIENS Caught OFF-GUARD with NO WM TO TURN AROUND as from the OPPOSITE END of the canyon, a BELLOWING WAR WHOOP: 
GREY WOLF AND HIS 40 APACHES CHARGE IN. A MOVING HUMAN WALL CRASH! The Apaches HURTLE into the flank of aliens. LASERS are met with the CRACK of RIFLES and hatchets -- 
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) 
TAKE THE FORT! ! ! The Apache leader spurs his horse onward, leading men toward the alien bunker. An EXPLOSION CONSUMES FRAME, becoming the: 
EXT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - ABOVE THE CLOUDS - CONTINUOUS 
-- PLASMA FIRE of the shuttle's burners as it ROARS toward the ALIEN SHIP... a SPECK against the BEHEMOTH: 
INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS 
The shuttle sweeps past the command center's polarized window, where... THE SLAVER watches with EVIL EYES. He's on the UPPER LEVEL of a TWO-TIER COMMAND CENTER. A DOZEN ALIENS operate holo-consoles. Readying the ship to leave. 
INT. TRANSPORT SHUTTLE - SAME 
Ella settles down on a GLOWING DOCKING COLLAR. With the two ships CONNECTED, the DISPLAY flashes a DEPARTURE ALERT: 
ELLA JAKE -- Dammit --- -- what--? 
-- WHAT'S WRQNG? -- she's CLIMBING back up the ladder, he FOLLOWS: 
INT. SHUTTLE - LADDER TUBE - CONTINUOUS 
They quickly CLIMB up the LADDER TUBE -- 
JAKE 
(QUIETLY; HARD) Okay. And starts walking to the elevator... as a SCREAM takes us to: 
INT. CANYON - DAY 
Handmade LADDERS are SWUNG FORWARD onto the fort as Apaches try to SCALE the wall, but are BLOWN BACK by ALIEN PARAPET SENTRIES. ON DOC -- running TRIAGE on wounded warriors: 
DOC I need more bandages now!/ You: lint and splint that leg! 
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) We're losing ranks ! ! ! And then, out of nowhere... the BANG BANG BANG of 30 pistols fills the air as -- DOLARHYDE RIDES IN WITH JAKE'S GANG! A renewed SURGE of energy as cowboys join Indians to fortify their ranks: 
NAT COLORADO You came back! 
DOLARHYDE Told you: I take care of my kin. Colorado knows that's as close to "I love you" as he'll ever get. But the UPSWING is short-lived as: A speeder WHIZZES past, dropping a METALLIC BUNDLE. It splits open right in front of the fort's STEEL GATES -- pieces hydraulically ASSEMBLING THEMSELVES in seconds, becoming: THE MOTHERFUCKING SUPERGUN_OF DEATH. TWO LETHAL BARRELS spin to life, firing STRANGE STEEL BALL BEARINGS in every direction. CLAW HOOKS snap out of the balls, EMBEDDING in soldiers! One LODGES in a GANG MEMBER beside DOC -- he FLAILS: 
GANG MEMBER 
HELP ME!!! GET IT OFF! A RED SPRING-LOADED PIN depresses in the ball's center: KA-BOOM! 
SEARING WHITE LIGHT TURNS THE OFFICER TOAASH -- AN ALIEN GRENADE! Doc goes FLYING from the kickback, landing near: GREY WOLF -- FWWWWTWHCK!!! Another claw-ball CLAMPS into the Apache's SHOULDER -- he SHOUTS, struggles to pull it out -- 
DOC 
DON'T. STOP, DAMMIT!!!! The RED PIN starts to depress -- pOC LUNGES, JAMS HIS FINGER RETJff&H_THE PIN AND BLASTING CAP. Now he's stopped it from exploding, but if he pulls his finger out... HE DIES TOO. DOC and GREY WOLF lock eyes. Their fates suddenly ENTWINED as -- 
INT. SCOUT SHIP - TURBOLIFT - MOVING - CONTINUOUS 
Bars of light move rhythmically across Jake's face -- BURNING with determination -- as he travels up in the turbolift. It slows to a STOP. The door cycles open and -- 
-- the STRANGEST THING happens. DESERT SAND billows in a gust of ventilated air. SAND?! Jake emerges, blocking his eyes: 
INT. SCOUT SHIP - JUNKPILE CARGO HANGAR - CONTINUOUS 
-- the sand swirls and eddies. Visibility reduced to ZERO. As Jake pushes through, the air clears a little... His eyes WIDEN. Trying to make SENSE of what he sees: Remember all those BUILDINGS that were pulled up into the tornado when Absolution was attacked? And that CRATER they found that used to be "Winfield's Landing"? It-'-s all-HE in a junkwle hangar. Building pieces. False front facades. Debris piled on top of each other, TILTED AND TWISTED AT FUNHOUSE ANGLES. And the desert sand that was sucked up along with it all. A GLOWING REACTOR casts hellish light on the dormant wreckage. Weapon ready, Jake moves past part of A BROTHEL. Jutting fragments of a HORSE CORRAL. A CREAKING SALOON SIGN swings like a pendulum, CLANKS EERILY. A STEAM PIPE EXPLODES STEAM. Jake WHIRLS -- and like demons... 5 ALIENS emerge. Slowly. Fanning out, taking positions as... THE SLAVER steps out of the smoke, squarely facing Jake. aAd_h@-- is holding ELLA hostage. WRIST BLASTER pressed to her throat. Jake and Ella LOCK EYES. She's terrified, but staying STRONG. His hand LINGERS at his hip, blaster ready. 
JAKE Drop the woman. We both know this ain't about her. But The Slaver only presses his blaster HARDER into Ella's neck. Almost GRINNING. And Jake MEETS the look -- 
JAKE (CONT'D) She says you're as bad as they come. Jake curls back the fingers on both hands, CRACKING knuckles: 
JAKE (CONT'D) Well, you ugly sonofabitch... they say the same about me. A pipe SPEWS STEAM -- UNNERVINGLY LOUD. Then STOPS. 
JAKE (CONT'D) Could'a had your boys kill me five times over, instead you rolled out the red carpet... so let's get it over with. 
The Slaver HISSES ANGRILY at the challenge. PUSHES Ella roughly off to one of his GANG, who keeps a blaster pressed to her side. Vow ' O right the a ter of the "town" junkpile. THE SLAVER -- his hand at his side, twitching. JAKE -- his hand is still. 
A PIPE SPRAYS STEAM AGAIN, SCREAMINGLY LOUD AND -- Everyone DRAWS! But Jake's INSANELY FAST as he drops to a knee and FIRES gunsmoke-style -- BLAM SLAM! The Slaver's HIT and -- ELLA -- WRENCHES her captor's arm backward and he fires USELESS ROUNDS into the air -- she takes a HIT in the leg as Jake SHOOTS the captor with a SHOT to the temple -- Jake GRABS and PULLS Ella to safety behind a SHREDDED STORE FRONT, taking cover -- lasers PUNCHING through the building walls -- Ella spots an ALIEN lunging around a corner: 
ELLA 
BEHIND YOU!!! Jake WHIRLS, SLAM!!! The creature FLIES off its feet. 
JAKE Stay down. Ella does, and here come the rest of the aliens as Jake GUNS 
THEM ALL DOWN WITH PERFECT AIM. The REACTOR is hit in the crossfire and the ship RESPONDS with a turbine HOWL. Corpses litter the floor... all except for The Slaver. A trail of FLUORESCENT BLOOD leads around the corner... Jake WHIRLS to Ella -- her leg wounded -- 
JAKE (CONT'D) -- you alright? In PAIN, she snatches one of those SMART DISCS off a dead alien: 
ELLA Reactor's hit. if I don't get this ship on the ground soon, we're all dead... (tries to STAND, WINCES) Get me over to that turbolift. He slings an arm around her shoulder and LIFTS her, helping her to the elevator -- 
ELLA (CONT'D) Put me inside. He does. She sees his eyes go back to The Slaver's BLOOD TRAIL: 
ELLA (CONT'D) I can manage the rest without you. (tough... but with 
COMPASSION) Go do what you came up here to do. He looks at her. At the blood. At the unstable REACTOR. And Jake Lonergan makes a CHOICE: 
WILL YOU GET ON WITH IT?111 
DOC AND DOLARHYDE One... two... three! And Doc RIPS the grenade from Grey Wolf's shoulder -- he HOWLS, CLAMPS tearing out of his flesh. But they did it! As more EXPLOSIONS decimate men, Dolarhyde PULLS the grenade out of Doc's hands, still holding his finger under the FIRING PIN -- 
DOC 
WHAT'RE YOU-- Dolarhyde looks at Colorado: 
DOLARHYDE Tell your mother I love her. With that, he CHARGES into the swirling chaos 
NAT COLORADO 
WAIT! -- but BOOM! Colorado's FORCED BACK by an explosion -- through the debris, he sees his father running toward... 
THE SUPERCANNON 
Dolarhyde HURLS the grenade -- BOOM!!! IT DETONATES IN A 
MILLION PIECES! DOLARHYDE DISAPPEARS IN THE BLAST! 
COLORADO 
NO!!!!! But his sacrifice 7M S THE TIDE! THE EXPLOSION BLOWS THE 
FORT'S FRONT GATES OFF! THEY TOPPLE ON A WHOLE BUNCH OF ALIENS! A CRY OF VICTORY as the humans STORM THROUGH! Aliens hurtle back in DISORDER -- 
INT. SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS 
The small ALIEN BRIDGE CREW scrambles to control the damaged ship. The WHIR of the lift arriving, doors OPEN and -- WHOOSH! The SMART WEAPON blurs out of the elevator, SLICING HALF A DOZEN ALIENS IN HALF -- circles back around to ELLA, who skillfully catches it as she RUN/LIMPS from the lift with JAKE -- LASER FIRE IGNITES THE BRIDGE as he makes QUICK WORK of the rest and Ella mans a console, getting to work -- 
ELLA We're going down fast. She calls up telemetry on a HOLO-WINDOW: EARTH TERRAIN -- The BATTLEFIELD. Sets coordinates, vectoring the ship that way: A WHIR as a SECOND TURBOLIFT arrives... AND THE SLAVER STEPS QQT. Wounded, and very PISSED OFF. Jake says to Ella: 
JAKE No matter what. Jake and The Slaver HURTLE into each other, TUMBLE off a catwalk, CRASHING into conduits and GUNKY WATER below. Jake staggers up but The Slaver is HUGE -- SLAMS Jake back into the water. PINS A FOOT on his blaster arm -- CRUSHING IT. Jake HOWLS as The Slaver presses a series of those HIEROGLYPH MARKINGS on Jake's BRACELET -- the symbols LIGHT UP in an UNLOCK CODE -- and KA-CHING! The bracelet POPS OF.E. The Slaver TOSSES IT into the gunky water. Draws his LASER WHIP -- WHUP-SNAP! The white-hot tip LASHES JAKE'S BACK, ripping his shirt and BURN-SCARRING HIS BACK! Jake SCREAMS in agony as The Slaver WHIPS HIM MERCILESSLY -- 
EXT. SKIES ABOVE DESERT - CONTINUOUS 
The Scout Ship SCREAMS down out of the cloud, toward the CANYON: 
EXT. CANYON BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS 
Outlaws and Apaches finish off the wounded, TOMAHAWKS RIPPING AWAY TENTACLED SCALPS! Carnage and joy -- but then: A MONSTROUS SHADOW spreads over the battlefield. Everyone looks up to see the SCOUT SHIP PLUMMETING DOWN -- 
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE) Fall back!!! NOW!! NOW!! 
INT. SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - LOWER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS 
Another LASER WHIP SNAP and Jake seems DONE. Now The Slaver LIFTS Jake from the water, CRUSHING his wind-pipe. Jake FLAILS, REACHING for something BELOW FRAME... finally GRABS and STABS it into The Slaver's side. The Alien ROARS in pain and looks down to see -- 
ONE OF HIS OWN "ICE TACKS" FROM HIS BANDOLIER EMBEDDED IN HIS 
SIDE. IT STARTS TO GLOW BLUE WITH A HIGH-PITCH WHINE: 
JAKE Go to hell. 
THE SLAVER'S ROAR OF DEFEAT IS CUT SHORT AS THE MOTHERFUCKER 
FREEZES TO GREY STONE. EXPLODING IN A MILLION PIECES!!! Jake DROPS, GASPING. Revenge fulfilled. Painfully starts CLIMBING a ladder back to the upper deck -- 
EXT. CANYON - BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS 
As the humans FLEE from the fort, the remaining aliens RETREAT to the last shuttles for ESCAPE... start to LIFT OFF... But find themselves SMASHING into the ENORMOUS HULL of the ship as_it crashe _down! 
INT. SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS 
Jake FALLS into the seat beside Ella, straps in. Fighting the controls, she SEES THE WHIP MARKS on his back. It TEARS her heart open. And because this might be the end... she ADMITS: 
ELLA We didn't get all of 'em. Some ran oft. That LANDS on Jake, as he too looks toward the endless horizon. HOLD on them, together, a VICTORIOUS but UNRESOLVED note... We RISE UP over the sea of bodies and the CRASHED SHIP, until Jake and Ella are just two small figures in the crowd... 
FADE TO: 
EXT. TOWN OF ABSOLUTION - DAY 
A glorious sight: Absolution in REBIRTH -- FLUSH from all that GOLD. Storefronts brightly painted, the streets ALIVE. We PICK UP EMMETT running through the hustle and bustle with two APACHE KIDS. Suddenly, DOLARHYDE, COLORADO and their gang ride in. SHERIFF TAGGART emerges from his office with DEPUTY WADE: 
SHERIFF TAGGART 
EMMETT! GET OVER HERE!!! 
EMMETT -- what? What'd I dQ? 
SHERIFF TAGGART EMMETT Get outta the road before you're run down! If your (overlapping) momma saw y-- -- "saw me playin' in the street she'd roll over in her grave and shoot lightnin' bolts outta her eyes," I know, I know! He runs off. Taggart SMIRKS: 
SHERIFF TAGGART Kid's got a mouth on him. 
DEPUTY WADE Well, Kyle, considering he saved your life, guess you'll just have to grin'n bear it. Dolar moves up to Taggart, tough as ever. The men HOLD looks: 
SHERIFF TAGGART Woodrow. 
DOLARHYDE Kyle. Percy STEWS about something. Dolar WHACKS him upside the head: 
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Go_ _on. Grudgingly, Percy hands Taggart a SHEAF OF PAPER -- 
SHERIFF TAGGART What's this? 
DOLARHYDE Claims to the land 50 miles west of here. I've signed it over to the township of Absolution. (off Taggart's LOOK) Considering I'm a businessman, I figure expansion's in both our interests. Needs the Sheriff's signature to be official. 
SHERIFF TAGGART Fifty miles west of here is where the goldmine is, Woodrow. 
DOLARHYDE 
(A BEAT) That so. With surprise, Taggart studies the paper. SMILES: 
SHERIFF TAGGART What's this about twenty percent going to the Apaches? Dolarhyde glances at Colorado. A moment. But the hardened rancher maintains his rock-solid facade: 
DOLARHYDE Figure the only way not to piss 'em off is to buy 'em. 
SHERIFF TAGGART Since when'd you worry about pissin' anyone off? 
DOLARHYDE Just sign it, Goddamnit. With a grin, Taggart gestures for Deputy Wade to turn around and flattens the paper on his BACK, using it as a surface to SIGN: 
SHERIFF TAGGART I'd say you were being generous, Woodrow, but I know you'd just be insulted. 
DOLARHYDE Damn right. Dolar gives his hat a TIP, then mounts up to go -- and we RISE UP to the UPPER FLOOR of the GOLD LEAF SALOON, in the process of being rebuilt in grand style -- and MOVE IN on a WINDOW where: 
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
DOC AND MARIA burst through a door, tearing passionately at each other's CLOTHES -- Maria MOANS as Doc kisses her neck: 
DOC MARIA SHH! The workers will hear us!!! Let them hear! As they TUMBLE back onto the bed, Doc LURCHES. Reaches under his back to find... a GOLD POCKETWATCH. 
DOC What is this? 
MARIA Look at the inscription. He flips it open to find an ENGRAVING: "MI CORAZON... POR SIEMPRE." Doc looks up at her, MOVED. Then -- PLAYFULLY: 
DOC This looks like Aldo Mayberry's watch... 
MARIA Shut up and kiss me. She pulls him down, OUT OF FRAME -- 
EXT. EDGE OF TOWN - DAY 
A hand unties a HORSE from its tether bar -- it's JAKE. Saddle bags packed. A BARK turns him around... HAPPY. Yipping for Jake to FOLLOW. He GRINS. As MUSIC begins to RISE -- HOPEFUL:

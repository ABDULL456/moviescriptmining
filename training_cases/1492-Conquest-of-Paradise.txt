CREDITS AND MUSIC OVER: 
INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - GRANADA - DAY 
We start on a man's elegant slipper.  He is seated in a splendid chair.  Moving up the stocking leg, we pass the garter of Castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate hands.  His fore finger impatiently plays with a large topaz ring.  Over this, we hear distant footsteps, echoing on marble floors. 
CUT TO: 
A Castilian face:  aquilaine profile, olive complexion, dark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard.  This is TREASURER SANCHEZ. 
A door slams somewhere, the footsteps getting closer.  We can now here a subdued conversation. 
TREASURER SANCHEZ stands up as: 
The door opens at the far end of the large gilded room. A WOMEN, magnificent in somber taffeta, enters.  QUEEN ISABEL OF SPAIN moves towards him. 
He bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large table.  She is followed by a PRIEST, BROTHER BUYL, and three dignitaries of Church and State. 
All sit beside her.  TREASURER SANCHEZ takes a document and starts to read aloud. 
On screen the words:  GRANADA - SPAIN - 1500 
SANCHEZ Your Majesty would wish to know the true facts concerning the island of Hispanola, our first settlement in the New World, and the activities there of your servant, Christopher Columbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea, Governor of that Island.  You will remember with what hopes and promises he beguiled us -- the truth is that he now presides over a state of chaos, degradation and madness beyond imagining. 
SANCHEZ punctuates each word carefully. 
SANCHEZ From the beginning, Columbus proved himself incapable of managing the affairs of the island.  He appointed his brothers to important positions, at once injuring the pride and dignity of the nobles who had gone with him.  He promised to build a city, the City of Isabel, named after Your Majesty.  What he actually built was nothing but a collection of huts, and that in the wrong place, for all of it was easily swept away by rain and mud. Is that not so, Brother Buyl? 
The PRIEST nods. 
BROTHER BUYL Yes, Your Honor. 
SANCHEZ He promised gold.  Not finding the easy quantities he promised, Columbus commanded each Indian to pay an annual tribute.  Most being unable to, they were barbarously punished, against the express wish of Your Christian Majesties... 
ISABEL lowers her eyes. 
SANCHEZ Since provocation and injustice never ceases, many of the Indians have fled to the forests, or have begun to slay the Christians. 
ISABEL looks over at BROTHER BUYL. 
ISABEL Could it be so? 
BROTHER BUYL Yes, Your Majesty. 
SANCHEZ But there is worse.  From the beginning, he forced the nobles to undergo physical labor, treating them equally with the Indians, all of them reduced to slavery.  When the nobleman Adrian de Moxica protested against such treatment... (he pauses) ... he was executed. (pause) Is that not true also, Brother Buyl? 
BROTHER BUYL Yes, Your Honor.  It is all true. All of it.  I saw it with my own eyes. 
SANCHEZ He has lost control.  His great arrogance has led him into depravity.  He encourages our soldiers to marry the native women. He promised a paradise, but he has made a hell full of all its horrors. 
Silence. 
ISABEL Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez? 
SANCHEZ Yes, Your Majesty. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  HUT - ISLAND - DAY 
CLOSE ON the FACE:  COLUMBUS is stretched on a bed, sweating heavily in fever, clearly delirious.  Insects crawl over his face, he makes no effort to swat them away. There is a dripping sound of water. 
FERNANDO (V.O.) Of all the words my Father wrote and there were many, I remember these the most.  "Nothing that results from human progress is achieved with unanimous consent..." 
Rain is falling into the room over documents spread on a table.  COLUMBUS stands up and moves to the table.  Some of the walls have been blackened with smoke and flames.  A lizard scuttles into the shadows. 
MARCHENA (fumbles in a pocket under his robe) I have something for you. 
Almost casually, he hands COLUMBUS a letter. 
MARCHENA You will be heard at the University of Salamanca... 
COLUMBUS stops dead in his tracks.  Almost frantically he tears open the letter, hardly able to believe his eyes. 
COLUMBUS God... That's in a week! 
MARCHENA That's what it says. 
COLUMBUS How did you manage it? 
MARCHENA (smiling) With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool. 
MARCHENA pushes open a second door, hidden behind a wooden panel. 
INT.  STUDY - LA RABIDA - DAY 
MARCHENA is not a tidy man.  Books are piled up on the floor, the desk, on every shelf, along with maps, instruments of astronomy... the visible evidence of an inquiring mind. 
With practiced familiarity, as if they had done this a hundred times -- which indeed they have -- MARCHENA sits behind his desk, and COLUMBUS opposite him.  MARCHENA lights a candle and considers the mess.  Then methodically, he slowly sweeps it from in front of him with his sleeve, exposing a large map underneath. 
When he looks up again, there is a new severity in his expression.  He turns over an hourglass. 
MARCHENA Why do you wish to sail west? 
COLUMBUS To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it... 
He leans forward, and points to the map spread out on the desk. 
COLUMBUS By sea, sailing around the African Continent -- the journey takes a year... 
His finger traces the journey, from west to east. 
COLUMBUS Or by land... 
We are CLOSE now on the map, as we watch his finger tracing a line between Europe and the Far East. 
COLUMBUS (O.S.) ... But the Turks have closed this route to all Christians.  Trading with the Orient has become arduous, if not dangerous. (he pauses) There is a third way... 
We notice that the outline of the European continent is familiar.  But we also notice that, in that great expanse of ocean, the whole American continent is missing. 
COLUMBUS By sailing West across the Ocean Sea. 
CLOSE ON MARCHENA'S FACE, touched by the mystery. 
MARCHENA How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite. 
COLUMBUS Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands. 
MARCHENA How can you be so certain? 
COLUMBUS The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras... 
MARCHENA (interrupting) Esdras is a Jew. 
COLUMBUS So was Christ! 
MARCHENA throws his quill in the air in frustration.  He glances at the hourglass: 
MARCHENA Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon. 
COLUMBUS (mockingly) I'll try to remember that, Marchena... 
MARCHENA Father Marchena! 
COLUMBUS (ignoring this) Passion is something one cannot control! 
MARCHENA (heatedly) You get so carried away when you are being contradicted! 
COLUMBUS I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity! 
MARCHENA (amused) Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son. 
EXT.  COURTYARD - LA RABIDA - EVENING 
DIEGO and FERNANDO wait in the courtyard.  COLUMBUS appears and lifts FERNANDO onto the mule.  DIEGO turns to go. 
They are eating around the table, and FERNANDO is unusually silent and thoughtful.  COLUMBUS pours a little wine into FERNANDO'S water, to distract him.  FERNANDO looks up at him, surprised.  COLUMBUS smiles, then looks over at BEATRIX. 
COLUMBUS Fernando, don't you think we are lucky to live with such a beautiful woman? 
He winks at FERNANDO.  BEATRIX smiles. 
INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The room is dark.  As COLUMBUS approached the bed with a candle, it illuminates the naked body of BEATRIX.  BEATRIX looks up at him intently.  A drop of wax falls on her skin.  She flinches, murmurs... 
They make love. 
EXT.  SALAMANCA UNIVERSITY - DAY 
A medieval "campus".  Students-novices are playing "pelote", with basket-gloves and a hard ball.  They run with their robes tucked around their waist, revealing white legs.  Others are studying, reading, hurrying to their class. 
We find COLUMBUS watching the game from the steps above the court.  Others are waiting with him.  A MONK comes from a door, and looks around the group. 
MONK (hesitant) Christopher Columbus? 
INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY 
An El Greco painting.  A tableau of twenty MEN sitting on dark, sculpted seats.  Candles throw a gloomy light on their faces.  Some are Churchmen, others are dressed in bourgeois outfits. 
Only one of them is richly dressed in the grand Spanish fashion -- he is SANCHEZ, Treasurer of the House of Aragon.  A MONK (Don AROJAZ) holds a stick with an ivory claw at the top.  Languidly, he scratches his back -- his off-hand manner only makes him more impressive than his peers. 
AROJAZ You say Asia can be found by sailing west? 
COLUMBUS Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks. 
AROJAZ Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ... (pause) Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus? 
COLUMBUS I am, Your Eminence 
AROJAZ Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately... (he leans forward) 22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable. 
He leans back, satisfied, and pauses for effect. 
AROJAZ But you may have found new evidence proving that these men of knowledge are totally mistaken! 
A ripple of mirthless laughter. 
COLUMBUS Your Excellencies are aware of the statements of Marin de Tyr? 
HERNANDO DE TALAVERA We are. 
COLUMBUS Then you are also aware that his theories contradict Ptolemeus... De Tyr believes the Ocean to be only 750 leagues... 
A murmur of protest spreads among the members of the Commission.  But Columbus is determined to press his theories. 
COLUMBUS The Florentine Toscanelli and the French Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly both think that Marin de Tyr is accurate in his calculations.  And therefore, that the ocean can be crossed. 
Indignant and amused murmurs.  DIEGO DE DEZA raises his voice to quiet the assembly. 
DIEGO DE DEZA Gentlemen, let us suppose Marin de Tyr is right... (the laughter subsides) Are we here to examine this proposal or not? 
Silence. 
DIEGO DE DEZA (to Columbus) In your opinion, how long would the voyage be? 
COLUMBUS Seven weeks.  Six, during the summer months. 
The murmur increases. 
AROJAZ Marin de Tyr is wrong -- and has been corrected many times over the centuries by the finest geographers. Your voyage, Don Colon, would take a year! 
A MAN of simple bearing, that COLUMBUS identifies as being a seaman, interrupts. 
VICUNA How would the crew survive without being able to land for fresh water? Water is undrinkable after six weeks!  You'd never be able to turn back! 
COLUMBUS We wouldn't have to turn back!  We would find land at this point! 
AROJAZ Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment. 
COLUMBUS Excellency, you are right. 
Instantly, the protests stop. 
COLUMBUS I am a seaman, not a scholar... But as a simple man craving for knowledge, I have read all the work of these renowned geographers and discovered that none of them could agree on the exact width of this ocean... 
SANCHEZ reaches for a decanter of sherry. 
SANCHEZ You know, Your Eminence, the fascinating thing about power, is that what can be given so effortlessly... 
He offers the decanter to AROJAZ, who automatically lifts his glass.  But instead, SANCHEZ pulls back the decanter, pours himself a drink, and replaces it on the table, leaving AROJAZ staring at his own empty glass. 
SANCHEZ ... can so easily be taken away. 
And he drinks with a smile. 
INT.  LA RABIDA - MARCHENA'S STUDY - EVENING 
MARCHENA reads aloud the Commission's letter. 
MARCHENA ... and therefore nothing could justify the participation of Your Highnesses in the venture that relies upon such feeble assumptions, and which any man of knowledge would take to be impractical... if not impossible. 
He shakes his head, puts the letter down.  COLUMBUS looks appalled; devastated. 
COLUMBUS They didn't listen.  They didn't want to listen! 
He paces about the book-lined room. 
MARCHENA You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait. 
COLUMBUS Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait? 
MARCHENA If God intends you to go, then you will go. 
COLUMBUS (angrily) Damn God! 
MARCHENA is shocked. 
MARCHENA Colon! 
COLUMBUS Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to! 
He seizes a beautiful book from MARCHENA'S desk. 
COLUMBUS These don't mean anything!  They're full of assumptions!  Out of the heads of old men who've never been past the end of their gardens! 
He hurls the book across the room.  MARCHENA is horrified. 
MARCHENA No...!  My books...! 
COLUMBUS seizes more books from the shelves, just sweeping them to the floor. 
COLUMBUS All of them!  Just lies! 
MARCHENA Colon!  Don't! 
MARCHENA tries to stop him.  In his fury, COLUMBUS accidentally knocks the poor old MAN to the ground.  His cries bring three MONKS rushing into the room. 
As COLUMBUS continues to rage and scatter books everywhere, they try to stop him, struggling with this big, powerful man -- to almost comical effect.  Finally, a short, muscular MONK delivers a quick punch that sends COLUMBUS crashing to the floor. 
INT.  CHAPEL OF LA RABIDA - EVENING 
COLUMBUS lies face down on the stone floor.  He is dressed in a homespun robe.  His arms are stretched out in penance.  FERNANDO and DIEGO look down at him. 
FERNANDO Father? 
DIEGO Sssshhhh...!  One can't speak to a man doing penance. 
FERNANDO What can you do? 
DIEGO Nothing.  That's the point, Fernando. 
A pause -- and then FERNANDO lies face down on the floor beside his FATHER, and stretches out his arms in the same way.  DIEGO is left looking on, unable to bring himself to join them. 
EXT.  CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY 
Along the cloister, maps are drying, hanging like laundry in the light breeze.  COLUMBUS pins up a new addition. Another MONK works nearby, in silence. 
PINZON (O.S.) Senor Colon? 
COLUMBUS turns, to see a small, stocky MAN approaching:  a middle-class gentleman.  He nods. 
PINZON Ah, thank God!  I've been looking all over Seville for you!  Never expected to find a sailor in a monastery, eh? 
He laughs.  COLUMBUS smiles, but doesn't say anything. PINZON is clearly a little surprised. 
INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY 
An ornate Moorish door is pushed open by the DUENA'S hand. We enter the Throne Room -- sculptured colonnades, mosaics... At the far end, windows open onto a view of Granada's rooftops. 
Against this dazzling light, the delicate silhouette of QUEEN ISABEL OF SPAIN.  The light in her blonde hair creates a halo around her head as she turns.  COLUMBUS falls to his knees. 
ISABEL Rise...!  Come forward! 
He approaches the window, stopping close to her.  ISABEL scrutinizes him quickly. 
ISABEL I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool. 
COLUMBUS (bold) No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors. 
ISABEL smiles, enjoying the lack of obsequiousness. 
ISABEL The ocean is uncrossable? 
COLUMBUS What did they say about Granada before today? 
ISABEL (a beat) That she was impregnable. 
ISABEL smiles again. 
ISABEL I cannot ignore the verdict of my council. 
COLUMBUS Surely you can do anything you want. 
A direct challenge.  She doesn't know what to make of this man. 
ISABEL How little you know. 
This little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their positions for a moment.  Now we sense COLUMBUS scrutinizing her. 
COLUMBUS May I speak freely? 
ISABEL (with a smile) You show no inclination to speak otherwise! 
COLUMBUS I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"... 
ISABEL (amused at his familiarity) A woman? 
A slight pause. 
COLUMBUS Forgive me... but you're the only Queen I know. 
She bursts out laughing. 
ISABEL Then we are equal... since you are the only sailor I know! 
A beat. 
ISABEL How old are you, Senor Colon? 
COLUMBUS Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you? 
Once again taken off guard, ISABEL flushes, and turns away slightly to hide it. 
ISABEL Thirty eight... 
A pause. 
ISABEL You will be informed of our decision. 
COLUMBUS bows and goes to leave.  As the DUENA opens the door for him, he turns back. 
COLUMBUS Actually, I thought you were younger than me! 
And he goes out, leaving her stunned. 
EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - TREE-LINED ROAD - DAY 
A chalk white road, lined with trees.  Two liveried SERVANTS are walking down the road, one carrying a large silver tray, the other a smaller tray. 
They are overtaken by an ADMINISTRATOR who hurries along the road, with documents under his arm. 
EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - DAY 
The CLERK enters an imposing stable block. 
COLUMBUS If you can do that, Excellency -- I'll become a monk! 
He turns, strides towards the door.  We hear a WOMAN'S muffled laughter. 
As COLUMBUS goes out, ISABEL appears through a secret door.  SANCHEZ bows. 
ISABEL goes over to the window and looks out. 
ISABEL You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted. 
SANCHEZ Never, Your Majesty.  Although... 
She turns, questioningly, towards him. 
SANCHEZ ... Although one may always renegotiate a contract.  Especially signed by Royal Hands. 
EXT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE GARDENS - POV - DAY 
SANCHEZ joins ISABEL at the window.  They see COLUMBUS striding out and away. 
INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY 
BACK TO SANCHEZ 
SANCHEZ (quietly) ... Into a monk... 
ISABEL (with a smile) Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it? (turning to Sanchez) Call him back! 
EXT.  STREET - EVENING 
Teeming life.  COLUMBUS pushing his way through crowds. He is expressionless and distracted. 
He looks around him, stops walking.  And then, unexpectedly, shouts. 
COLUMBUS YEEEEEEES! 
All heads turn as if he were totally insane.  He walks on as if nothing happened. 
INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
COLUMBUS is sitting at the kitchen table, by himself, with a glass of wine.  There is a movement behind him.  BEATRIX is standing at the foot of the stairs, in a night-shirt. 
COLUMBUS turns and looks at her, almost sad. 
COLUMBUS She said yes. 
BEATRIX (moved) Thank God... 
She smiles.  But he seems to be unable to share her happiness. 
COLUMBUS If I ever come back, I swear I will... 
She crosses to him quickly, placing her hand gently on his mouth. 
BEATRIX (softly) I'm not asking you to swear to anything. 
COLUMBUS I don't want you to wait for me. 
BEATRIX (smiling) That's something you can't decide. 
COLUMBUS kisses her. 
INT.  CORRIDOR - BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Strange, unearthly music... A flickering light in a dark tunnel.  FERNANDO, holding a candle in front of him, walks slowly down the dark corridor. 
Quietly opening a door, he walks into COLUMBUS' study. 
INT.  COLUMBUS' STUDY - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON:  A huge illustrated map of western Europe and Asia.  FERNANDO'S candle moves slowly across the Atlantic Ocean, to the edge of the map.  There, the illustrator's imagination has created monsters:  terrifying demons; creatures half-human, half-animal. 
Sitting at his desk, COLUMBUS is looking at the map. 
FERNANDO (O.S.) You can't go there! 
Turning, COLUMBUS finds his son beside him. 
COLUMBUS Why not? 
He looks up and down the line, finishing on ALONSO.  They stare at one another. 
ALONSO God doesn't want us to cross the ocean...!  This voyage is cursed! 
Some of the MEN murmur their agreement. 
COLUMBUS Cursed? 
ALONSO We set sail for greed.  God has abandoned us.  The voyage is cursed. There are signs... 
ALONSO glances towards the SHIP'S BOY, with his hair lip. The BOY lowers his eyes.  COLUMBUS moves towards him, pulls him forward, stands him in front of ALONSO. 
COLUMBUS This boy has the voice of an angel. What comes out of his mouth is blessed, Alonso.  What comes out of your is evil. 
Some of the men laugh at this statement.  ALONSO is ill at ease.  COLUMBUS pauses, looks around at all the MEN. 
COLUMBUS Listen to me!  Every man is afraid who does something for the first time.  But those who overcome their fears, will find their rewards.  I do not know if it is God's will that we cross this ocean -- but I am certain it is the devil who puts fears into our hearts... 
The MEN are listening.  We sense a subtle change of mood... 
COLUMBUS This jacket to the first man who sights land!  I want a man up that mast day and night. 
COLUMBUS points at the SHIP'S BOY. 
COLUMBUS You start first. 
The SHIP'S BOY rushes up the mast.  As he climbs, the mainsail starts to fill with wind.  The deck begins to move under their feet. 
This movement under their feet seems to imperceptibly erase the fears and the angers. 
MENDEZ Alonso!  Jaime!  Don't let this wind escape us. 
CRIES from the other ships, as the sails snap taut, filling with wind.  MEN rush to their posts.  PINZON stares at COLUMBUS, shaking his head in disbelief. 
PINZON (murmuring) You lucky bastard... 
COLUMBUS walks away to his cabin, then turning back to PINZON. 
COLUMBUS Pinzon, the more I sail, the luckier I get. 
Turning abruptly, he enters his cabin. 
EXT.  SANTA MARIA - PROW - MISTY NIGHT 
COLUMBUS is seated, isolated at the prow, wrapped in his cape, struggling against the sleep.  MENDEZ approaches him with a bowl of soup. 
MENDEZ Shall I take my turn? 
COLUMBUS shakes his head no, and starts drinking from the bowl. 
CUT TO: 
COLUMBUS' head nods lower and lower to his chest.  He is asleep.  We become aware of a sharp buzzing sound.  It becomes louder as we move closer to COLUMBUS' face. 
A mosquito lands on his temple.  COLUMBUS reflexively slaps it.  He wakes up, and looks at his fingers -- a spot of blood, a crushed mosquito.  He stares at it for a moment.  Then slowly gets to his feet. 
EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT 
In the luminous moonlight, COLUMBUS is standing, staring up at thousands of insects that wheel around the mast lantern.  We hear the flutter of their wings and see the bats as they swoop and dive in a feeding frenzy. 
COLUMBUS turns, stares into the darkness, desperate to see the land that must be close. 
He kneels by MENDEZ, wrapped in a blanket.  He touches his shoulder. 
COLUMBUS (murmuring) Mendez!  Mendez! 
MENDEZ grimaces, and opens one eye. 
COLUMBUS Land... 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SHIP - DAWN 
An opaque dawn.  COLUMBUS, riveted, staring forward as if to pierce the mist.  The entire crew are clinging to the rail, and standing on the shrouds. 
Suddenly, the SHIP BOY'S voice cracking with emotion. 
SHIP'S BOY TIERRA...!  TIERRA! 
The INDIANS talk among themselves.  The ELDERS smoke primitive cigars -- and offer them, with good humor, to their guests.  The SPANIARDS cough and choke at first... and laugh.  In return, they offer the INDIANS wine... 
Dogs roam around the campfires.  The WOMEN openly suckle their babies.  The MEN are entranced. 
PINZON draws out attention, for the first time, to a small gold ornament on the nose of one of the INDIANS.  He points to it, indicates his interest in it. 
PINZON Gold...!  Gold! 
The INDIANS says the word in his own language, laughing. We see that some of the other INDIANS also have small gold ornaments. 
PINZON repeats the INDIAN word for gold.  The INDIAN removes the ornament from his nose, gives it to PINZON, who indicates that he wants to have it.  The INDIAN nods -- but points to PINZON'S dagger, indicating that he wants it in return.  PINZON shakes his head, stops the INDIAN from taking it. 
COLUMBUS (to Pinzon) Give it to him! 
PINZON looks at him, about to argue -- but COLUMBUS insists.  PINZON takes out the dagger and offers it to the INDIAN. 
PINZON (irritated) By God!  That's the worst trade of my life! 
His friends laugh.  Innocently, the INDIAN has taken it by the blade.  He yelps, looks down at the blood welling up... A moment of tension... Then MENDEZ laughs at his clumsiness, and the ELDERS laugh too... and the INDIAN laughs. 
Just outside this circle, we see the first INDIAN we saw, squatting on his haunches, watching.  This is UTAPAN. 
INT.  TENT - DAWN 
The first light outside -- the strange, wonderful sounds of the jungle all around.  COLUMBUS writes in his journal. 
COLUMBUS (V.O.) October 21st, 1492.  I think we have returned to Eden.  Surely this is how the world once was, before the beginning of time.  I believe no man will ever see this land again as we do, for the first time... 
He looks up.  UTAPAN is squatting in the doorway of the hut.  He's been there all night.  COLUMBUS takes more ink on his quill and begins to sketch UTAPAN'S face in the margin of his log-book.  He draws well. 
He gets up and walks over to UTAPAN and shows him the drawing.  It's an electrifying moment.  UTAPAN is shocked and amazed.  At first he is rather frightened of his own image... Then he is happy, and laughs... and COLUMBUS laughs with him and puts a hand on his shoulder in a gesture of friendship. 
UTAPAN gets up, and indicates that he too has something he wishes to offer. 
EXT.  JUNGLE - MORNING 
UTAPAN expertly scampering through the jungle.  COLUMBUS follows him. 
UTAPAN orders COLUMBUS to sit.  COLUMBUS obeys.  UTAPAN looks up at the tops of the trees.  The sun is rising, and filters through the foliage.  As if the time had come, UTAPAN stands up, and COLUMBUS does the same. 
A gap in the dense vegetation.  Something is glittering. Gold.  A mass of gold.  As they approach, COLUMBUS discovers -- 
A large pool of fresh water.  The morning sunlight has turned the water into liquid gold.  The surface ripples with the breeze.  UTAPAN smiles.  It the stranger satisfied?  Isn't this what he came for? 
COLUMBUS plunges into the pool.  As he emerges, he fills his palms with liquid gold. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  RIVER - DAY 
Wide shot -- A flotilla of canoes are going upstream. 
INDIANS AND SPANIARDS are traveling together in the canoes.  UTAPAN leads the expedition in COLUMBUS' craft. THE SHIP BOY'S cranium is shaved like UTAPAN'S, and we notice that some other crew members are beardless, some even wearing tribal patterns. 
EXT.  RIVERSIDE - DAY 
INDIAN VILLAGERS confronting the SPANIARDS, UTAPAN talks to an ELDER MAN, watched by COLUMBUS, MENDEZ and PINZON. 
UTAPAN repeats several times the word for GOLD, showing some artifacts.  The OLD INDIAN shakes his head no, indicating another distant place. 
OLD INDIAN Cuba!  Cuba! 
THE OLD MAN nods, points into the distance, chatters away to UTAPAN. 
UTAPAN Say not here!  Cuba! 
COLUMBUS What is it?  A tribe?  An island? 
UTAPAN Island.  Far. 
EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY 
Standing at the prow of the ship, his long dark hair floating in the wind, UTAPAN rejoicing at the speed. 
EXT.  THICK JUNGLE - CUBA - DAY 
Led by UTAPAN, the SPANIARDS hack their way through thick jungle.  It's hard work.  The MEN sweat.  This is inhospitable terrain.  Even the noises of the jungle seem somehow more sinister... 
CUT TO: 
COLUMBUS Tell the Chief we thank him. 
UTAPAN Chief knows. 
COLUMBUS Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort. 
UTAPAN translates. 
COLUMBUS Tell him we will return very soon. Many of us. 
UTAPAN translates.  The CHIEF GUARIONEX asks a simple question. 
UTAPAN Chief says -- how many? 
COLUMBUS Thousands. 
UTAPAN Why? 
COLUMBUS doesn't seem to understand the question.  For the first time he seems to be caught short. 
COLUMBUS To bring the word of God. 
UTAPAN Chief says -- he has a God. 
COLUMBUS (pursuing) ... and also to bring medicine. 
UTAPAN Chief says... 
COLUMBUS (interrupting) He has medicine. (pause) Tell him we admire his people. 
UTAPAN translates. 
UTAPAN Chief says he knows you like his... (searches for the word) Women... 
And the CHIEF gets up, awards COLUMBUS with a smile, and walks out of the hut, the ELDERS following, leaving COLUMBUS alone. 
COLUMBUS (with a little smile) That's a beginning... 
EXT.  SHORE - DAY 
Watched from the shore by the INDIANS and by about forty of the SPANIARDS, who are staying behind, the boats pull out towards the two remaining ships. 
PINZON is laid out in the bottom of the boat.  COLUMBUS, UTAPAN, and four other INDIANS are in the same boat. 
COLUMBUS (V.O.) March 1493... Thirty nine of my men volunteered to stay behind.  God willing we will be back in less than a year... 
The boats continue to pull away, the figures on the shore growing smaller. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON:  a golden mask... the lamp in the cabin swings violently back and forth, creating strange shadows, as if the mask was alive... COLUMBUS is writing with difficulty in his log-book. 
COLUMBUS (V.O.) ... Several men are ill.  We did not find signs of civilization.  No cities, no temples... Nothing that resembles Marco Polo's descriptions. My ships are not filled with the spices and the gold that Spain was hoping for.  But this land intoxicates the senses like the strongest of perfumes... And all I can think of, is to return to these untamed lands... 
Suddenly the cabin seems to lurch over.  Things fall from the table, smashing on the floor... COLUMBUS nearly falls. 
EXT.  SEA - NIGHT 
We are in the middle of a violent storm -- of terrifying proportions.  The thunder is deafening.  Light irradiates the darkness.  We see the two caravels, dwarfed by the massive seas. 
EXT.  DECK - NIGHT 
Five MEN are struggling to lash down the tiller.  The deck jumps and rolls.  It rises five meters into the air then falls into space and hits the water with a terrible crack. Waves sweep over the decks.  We hear desperate cries for mercy from the terrified crew, loud enough to be heard above the storm. 
COLUMBUS and MENDEZ are crawling towards the mast, along a lifeline. 
COLUMBUS (screaming to the sailors) Get below!  All of you!  Go! 
The MEN start to scramble below decks. 
COLUMBUS (to Mendez) Stay with me! 
The ship rolls again.  COLUMBUS and MENDEZ crawl towards the mast.  Another gigantic wave crashes over them, tons of water falling like cement.  They reach the mast.  The wood groans. 
COLUMBUS We may have to cut it! 
MENDEZ nods... COLUMBUS grabs some rope.  The ship rises into the air again, crashes down, the deck disappearing beneath them for a moment. 
BEATRIX For once I wish you weren't right. 
COLUMBUS puts his arm around her waist, pulling her closer, they move away. 
EXT.  FAR END OF THE ORANGERY - DAY 
FERNANDO is now swinging expertly in the hammock.  UTAPAN is pushing him gently.  He slowly straightens up to watch COLUMBUS and BEATRIX disappear, somehow sensing there is a dilemma.  FERNANDO noticing UTAPAN'S reaction, turns to his parents.  The arbor is empty.  FERNANDO becomes pensive. 
We become aware of the rustling of the jungle. 
SLOW DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  BEACH AND EDGE OF JUNGLE - DAY 
FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN spread along the beach, looking towards the jungle.  COLUMBUS stands beside his BROTHERS, and MENDEZ, and UTAPAN. 
MOXICA, astride a magnificent black horse, prances back and forth across the sand.  All are waiting. 
A signal cannon is fired from one of the ships.  Birds scatter into the air from the jungle -- but then silence, complete and ominous.  COLUMBUS stares into the jungle. Nothing.  No one to greet them -- no welcoming party from the MEN they left behind. 
COLUMBUS glances at MENDEZ. 
MENDEZ looks at him, but can't answer. 
MOXICA suddenly spurs on his horse, and guides it into the trees.  The order is given for the rest to follow, fanning out as they do so, weapons at the ready. 
EXT.  CLEARING - JUNGLE - DAY 
Ruins.  The camp has been burned to ashes.  A strange sight:  arrows are stuck vertically into the ground, each with a moldering tuft of human hair attached to the flight. 
In silence the SOLDIERS pick their way through the devastation. 
The ground is littered with coconuts.  Kicking one over with his shoe, a SOLDIER discovers that his coconut is actually a human skull.  The gaping mouth has been filled to the brim with gold. 
But of the living, there is no sign. 
MOXICA Is this your new world, Don Colon? 
COLUMBUS looks around in dismay.  A YOUNG NOBLEMAN, HERNANDO DE GUEVARA, takes out his sword. 
GUEVARA These animals should be shown what savagery can be! 
Other SPANIARDS join in, repeating this last word. 
NOBLEMAN Three heads for every life taken. No mercy before God! 
GUEVARA No mercy!  Let's find them. 
COLUMBUS No Guevara.  There will be no revenge. 
Silence.  Everyone looks at COLUMBUS. 
MOXICA We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood. 
COLUMBUS If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say. 
They are all listening. 
COLUMBUS Moxica, I lost friends too... Thirty nine brave men who trusted me. 
He walks among them. 
COLUMBUS You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe? 
MOXICA We don't need to know. 
COLUMBUS We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for. 
EXT.  INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY 
MOXICA mounted on his magnificent BLACK STALLION canters to the edge of the deserted village and enters the village.  UTAPAN is terrorized by the absence of anything living. 
All we can hear is the breathing of the horse.  The animal, an impressive mass of muscle, prances nervously. 
UTAPAN calls out in dialect. 
UTAPAN They here. 
Slowly, they begin to appear, one after the other -- materializing from the jungle.  Shy and scared. 
Water thundering into the new canal.  The huge wheel begins to turn.  The MEN cheer and congratulate each other.  MOXICA looks at his mud-splattered and foaming horse, his eyes full of hatred. 
EXT.  CITY OF ISABEL - TWILIGHT 
A wide, high shot of the new "City", dominated by a huge wooden cross -- no more than a muddy main street bordered by a hundred bamboo and stone shanties, with candles burning in the doorways.  A main square with the Governor's Mansion, and the foundations of a church. 
In the twilight, COLUMBUS and the other WORKERS returning, dirty and tired. 
EXT.  VERANDA OF MOXICA'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT 
MOXICA and GUEVARA sit out on the "veranda", watching the MEN return.  MOXICA raises his glass in an ironic salute. 
MOXICA To the Governor of the Mosquitoes! 
They laugh.  We see the smoke and flames from a fire. Four or five INDIANS are squatting on the earth nearby, cooking for them, talking quietly in their own language. 
MOXICA calls out something in their language, and a naked YOUNG INDIAN GIRL comes out of the house, bringing more wine.  GUEVARA stares at her lasciviously.  MOXICA, letting his hand casually brush against her flank, smiles at him. 
MOXICA Do you want her? 
He turns the GIRL round so that GUEVARA can admire her properly.  GUEVARA nods.  MOXICA lets the GIRL go with a peremptory order, and she disappears back inside. 
GUEVARA suddenly stands up -- unsteadily -- and sweeping his arm round in a broad gesture, says ironically: 
GUEVARA To the new world, my friend!  To the new world! 
INT.  DINING ROOM - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT 
In an already Spanish-colonel dining room, COLUMBUS is having dinner with his brothers, BARTOLOME and GIACOMO, served by an INDIAN WOMAN -- NIMA.  GIACOMO eats with gusto. 
GIACOMO (as Nima pours the wine) Nima's a good cook! 
BARTOLOME She's more than that! 
Seeing GIACOMO'S sudden blush and discomfort, as NIMA smiles at him, the other BROTHERS laugh. 
To cover his embarrassment, GIACOMO returns to the topic of the food. 
GIACOMO What is it? 
COLUMBUS Eat!  I'll tell you later. 
As he sees BARTOLOME stifling a laugh, GIACOMO pauses. 
GIACOMO I'd like to know what I'm eating. 
COLUMBUS eats a mouthful, glances at BARTOLOME. 
COLUMBUS Iguana. 
A look of horror crosses GIACOMO'S face; he wretches slightly, puts down his fork, and gulps down some wine. The BROTHERS laugh again. 
COLUMBUS What wrong with it?  The Indians eat it! 
GIACOMO I'm not an Indian. 
BARTOLOME He wishes he were back in the seminary.  Priests always eat well. (tasting his wine, grimacing) And they have very good cellars. 
GIACOMO Nothing grows here!  Everything rots in the ground.  The wheat and vines wither before we can harvest them. 
COLUMBUS We've got to learn to live like the Indians. (pause) Eat your Iguana! 
Reluctantly this time, GIACOMO goes back to his dinner. 
EXT.  BALCONY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT 
They are drinking and smoking cigars.  From the balcony they can see the dark mass of the jungle stretching away. GIACOMO is already dozing in his chair.  BARTOLOME sees it, and elbows COLUMBUS.  They both smile at their younger brother's exhaustion.  Then COLUMBUS gets up and leans on the balustrade, looking down at the city, the jungle beyond. 
COLUMBUS How much gold have we found? 
BARTOLOME Not enough to justify a single shipment. 
COLUMBUS Perhaps it doesn't exist anywhere but in my imagination. 
BARTOLOME Then let's hope not... (pause) What will happen if we can't find enough gold? 
They begin to hear the sound of a flute -- a melancholy sound.  COLUMBUS looks out over the jungle, and kills a mosquito by slapping his arm. 
COLUMBUS (jokingly) Then I'm Governor of the Mosquitoes. 
CLERK Don't Moxica!  You can't... 
CUT TO: 
GIACOMO and the CLERK running to the scene. 
CUT TO: 
MOXICA (to the clerk) I can't?  I can't? 
With a single swift action, MOXICA draws his sword and cuts off the INDIAN'S hands. 
ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.  The INDIANS flee, disappearing into the jungle.  GIACOMO arrives at this moment.  He stares at the dismembered hands in horror. 
INT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - EVENING 
A tribunal.  Sitting behind a table with his brothers, and flanked by his council, COLUMBUS presides.  MOXICA stands before them. 
COLUMBUS In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery! 
MOXICA (casually) Savagery is what monkeys understand. 
COLUMBUS You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say? 
MOXICA (with exquisite insolence) You will regret this. 
He strolls to the GUARDS at the back of the room. 
EXT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT 
Everything is quiet on the mine site. 
On the terrace, TWO SOLDIERS are drinking in turn, and cracking jokes.  One of them leans against the wooden wall.  He laughs as he hears repeated banging behind him. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT 
A THIRD SOLDIER is fucking an INDIAN WOMAN against the wall. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT 
On the terrace, his two COMPANIONS laugh and encourage his efforts. 
A whooshing sound.  An arrow embeds itself in the chest of the SOLDIER who was leaning against the wall.  He is nailed to the wood behind him. 
THE OTHER SOLDIER stares at him, transfixed, until an arrow pierces his throat.  He collapses, unable to cry out for help. 
INT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT 
FOUR INDIANS in full warrior outfit, their faces painted, burst into the room.  Still busy with the WOMAN, his eyes facing the wall, the SOLDIER believes the intruders to be his friends. 
SOLDIER (without stopping) You animals!  Can't you wait! 
Discovering the FOUR TERRIFYING FIGURES staring at her, the INDIAN WOMAN starts screaming and pushes back the SOLDIER.  He turns around, jumps off the WOMAN, and starts to scramble to the front door, trying to put on his trousers. 
THE FOUR INDIANS catch him, and force him to lay on the ground.  THE MAN struggles, his eyes rolling in terror. TWO INDIANS force his mouth open.  A THIRD ONE kneels and starts stuffing it with gold dust.  THE SOLDIER chokes and suffocates. 
THE WOMAN still stands half naked against the wall, terrified.  AN INDIAN takes his knife from his leggings, slowly.  She starts sobbing and imploring in her language. THE INDIAN slowly walks to her, and plants the knife in the lower part of her belly. 
EXT.  MINE - DAY 
PAIRS of bloody red legs hanging still, high in the air. 
Pulling back, we discover: 
A DOZEN SPANIARDS have been crucified on the scaffolding of the excavations.  Some hands and noses have been removed. 
UTAPAN is standing, uncomfortable among the SPANIARDS. 
A SOLDIER removes a huge iron nail from a wrist.  One of the CRUCIFIED BODIES is gently laid on the ground.  He is still alive -- not for long. 
COLUMBUS and BARTOLOME are silent with rage. 
BARTOLOME (aggressively) Moxica is right.  Our ways don't work! 
BARTOLOME turns to UTAPAN. 
MOXICA You know what they will say in Spain about my death -- don't you? 
He takes another step backwards, as COLUMBUS moves towards him. 
MOXICA You are nothing!  You bastards will never inherit your titles.  We are everything.  We are immortal! 
He smiles, and steps back into space. 
EXT.  ROCKS BELOW CLIFF TOP - DAY 
His body falls, bounces off the rocks below, crashes into the water. 
EXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY 
COLUMBUS stares down as his body is swept away. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SQUARE OF ISABEL - DAY 
CLOSE ON COLUMBUS' expressionless face. 
CUT TO: 
A MUTINEER -- his face is white, he is crying and trembling.  His arms are tied behind his back.  He is held fast, a rope is put around his neck. 
COLUMBUS, sitting not far away beside his BROTHERS, gives a signal. 
Drums begin to beat.  BROTHER BUYL looks on impassive. 
A grimace suddenly transform THE YOUNG MAN'S face.  He is being garroted -- his throat crushed with a rope.  The YOUNG MAN'S feet dance frenziedly.  We hear the choking. 
The drums cease.  BROTHER BUYL crosses himself and murmurs a prayer, deeply distraught.  GIACOMO has covered his eyes. 
A wider view shows the bodies of three other ARISTOCRATS from the rebellion, attached to chairs affixed to a pole, their heads straight, the rope still tight around their necks. 
Justice has been done.  The members of the COUNCIL rise in silence, COLUMBUS stands up. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  ISABEL - QUAYSIDE - DAY 
CLOSE ON several large wooden cages.  Inside we see the INDIANS that COLUMBUS captured.  They are packed together. They stare out with vacant eyes.  SOLDIERS guard them.  A ship against the pier.  BUYL at his side, COLUMBUS stares at the INDIANS. 
BROTHER BUYL I wish to go back with them, Don Colon.  I have no desire to remain in this godless place. 
COLUMBUS You may do as you please, Brother Buyl -- though your departure will not help me to make it more Godly. 
BROTHER BUYL looks at him, almost with astonishment. 
BROTHER BUYL You treat Christians equally with heathen savages.  You execute members of the nobility.  And what do you offer in return? 
COLUMBUS (quietly) A new world, Brother Buyl. 
BROTHER BUYL Nobody wants one...!  Only you! 
And he walks away. 
EXT.  ISLAND - EVENING 
Against the livid horizon, three black waterspouts join the sky to the sea.  A gust of wind disturbs the roof of the jungle. 
INT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - EVENING 
The wind grows stronger.  Doors bang inside the building... a melancholy sound. 
COLUMBUS sits on the balcony with his BROTHERS.  They are silent.  After a few moments, COLUMBUS begins to speak quietly, almost as if he were speaking to himself. 
COLUMBUS Perhaps hope only exists in the journey.  When it begins, everything is still possible -- every expectation; every dream... 
The BROTHERS do not answer. 
COLUMBUS This is not how I imagined it to be. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  JUNGLE - NEAR ISABEL - NIGHT 
UTAPAN begins to shave his head... 
SANCHEZ (V.O.) I am thinking of a man.  A devotee to Your Majesties.  A man extremely motivated... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  STREETS OF ISABEL - DAY 
FIVE MEN on HORSEBACK, dressed in fashionable clothes, canter down what used to be the main street of Isabel. Through some has been rebuilt, the effects of the hurricane are still visible... 
People look at them curiously.  We see them stop near the Governor's mansion.  The MEN dismount and walk into the Palace. 
INT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAY 
One of the MEN in black clothes removes his hat and steps forward.  We recognize him as ALONSO DE BOBADILLA, the man COLUMBUS humiliated at the rotunda. 
COLUMBUS is sitting at his desk, studying plans with GIACOMO.  Some other MEMBERS of the COUNCIL are with them. 
BOBADILLA Don Alonso de Bobadilla. 
COLUMBUS Yes... I remember... 
BOBADILLA turns, gestures to one of the other MEN, who comes forward and gives him a roll of parchment, bearing the royal seal. 
BOBADILLA My letters of appointment. 
COLUMBUS Appointment to what? 
BOBADILLA Viceroy of the West Indies. 
COLUMBUS Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland. 
BOBADILLA smiles wickedly, happy to give COLUMBUS a low blow. 
BOBADILLA Didn't you learn?  The mainland was discovered.  Weeks ago.  By another Italian.  I forgot his name. 
A MAN IN BLACK Amerigo Vespucci, Excellency. 
COLUMBUS pales.  Then... 
COLUMBUS How far from here? 
BOBADILLA I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed. 
COLUMBUS How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would. 
BOBADILLA I am afraid this is not the worst news. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CELL - SEVILLE PRISON - DAY 
All is dark.  We can just make out COLUMBUS' face as he lies on the hard bed.  He is sweating heavily; his beard is filthy and matted, like his hair.  He looks feverish. 
A key turns in the lock. 
The JAILER lets in two fashionably dressed YOUNG MEN. COLUMBUS, blinking in the light, turns his head to stare at them.  His eyes are reddened with infection at the corners.  The YOUNG MEN come forward into the light. 
FERNANDO (quietly) Father? 
Unable to believe it, COLUMBUS slowly sits up. 
COLUMBUS Fernando...!  My God...! 
He laughs, overcome with joy.  Embraces DIEGO. 
COLUMBUS A man!  Diego, how did this happen? 
DIEGO Santangel is going to see the Queen. We are going to get you out of here. 
COLUMBUS Good!  I have to go back! 
DIEGO and FERNANDO look at one another, then back at COLUMBUS, incredulously, seeing his filthy clothes, his eyes rimmed with dried mucus. 
DIEGO Go back? 
There's a new excitement in COLUMBUS' voice.  He walks over to the table.  The candlelight illuminates maps, charts, drawings, figures... 
COLUMBUS I have to explore the mainland. 
FERNANDO This time with me! 
SANCHEZ Then why? 
ISABEL Because he is not afraid of me. 
INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - CORRIDOR - DAY 
SANCHEZ, in another direction, along a corridor, towards his office.  As he reaches a corner with a wide window, a hand seizes him.  COLUMBUS. 
SANCHEZ All I have to do is call the guards. 
COLUMBUS Call them. 
SANCHEZ looks at him -- and doesn't call.  COLUMBUS lets go of him. 
SANCHEZ I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer. 
COLUMBUS Look out of that window. 
Surprised, SANCHEZ nevertheless turns, looks out. 
COLUMBUS What do you see? 
SANCHEZ Roofs... towers, palaces... spires... 
COLUMBUS All of them created by people like me. 
SANCHEZ turns round again to face him. 
COLUMBUS No matter how long you live, Sanchez, there's something that will never change between us.  I did it! You didn't! 
COLUMBUS turns abruptly and walks away, vanishing down the echoing corridor. 
EXT.  COLUMBUS' MANOR HOUSE - DAY 
COLUMBUS dismounts in the courtyard.  Everything seems deserted.  There's no one about, no sign of life... 
INT.  MANOR HOUSE - DAY 
COLUMBUS walks slowly through the great rooms.  There is nothing left:  no furniture, rugs, pictures... nothing. 
He turns, sees BEATRIX standing in a doorway, looking back at him.  They are both moved. 
COLUMBUS God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me... 
BEATRIX They tried... but I didn't let them. 
She smiles.  They don't dare to touch.  BEATRIX looks round the empty room. 
BEATRIX They took everything... 
COLUMBUS (looking at her) Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier... 
They laugh.  There's a pause. 
COLUMBUS God, how much I've missed you! 
And they throw themselves into each other's arms. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  DINING ROOM - MANOR HOUSE - EVENING 
All that has been left is a simple table and one chair. They are having supper by candlelight in the vast, empty room, though the candles throw a warm, sensuous glow on the figs and hams and wine... and on their faces, as BEATRIX sits on his lap. 
SANTANGEL (O.S.) One chair.  One table.  What more can a man expect, when he tries to sue the Crown? 
They laugh.  With only a little embarrassment, BEATRIX gets off COLUMBUS' knee.  SANTANGEL comes forward, and COLUMBUS embraces him like an old friend.  BEATRIX goes to the kitchen. 
COLUMBUS I owe you everything, Santangel... but as you see, I can't repay you. 
SANTANGEL On the contrary.  It is I who owe you everything.  Through you, I have been an adventurer, an explorer! It's true I shall never see the new world... but it's here... (he points to his head) And here... (pointing to his heart) 
COLUMBUS smiles.  BEATRIX returns with a plate and glass for SANTANGEL. 
SANTANGEL What you are, Colon, is a sailor, a discoverer, a man of imagination... not a politician.  You weren't meant to govern -- You cannot be all things to all men. 
He takes the wine BEATRIX offers, and raises his glass. 
SANTANGEL I wish you could have compromised. It would have made your life easier... 
COLUMBUS (stunned) An ocean...?  He's says it's an ocean? 
FERNANDO I don't understand. 
COLUMBUS is too stunned for a moment to explain.  The INDIANS laugh. 
Then COLUMBUS takes the charcoal, and begins to draw on the map, for his son. 
COLUMBUS Here is Europe... and over here, the continent of Asia.  But there's something in between!  Another continent!  We've found... another continent! 
FERNANDO stares west, then back at his FATHER.  COLUMBUS looks very feverish, his face bathed with sweat. 
FERNANDO Father... 
COLUMBUS There must be a passage to that other ocean. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  SHIP - COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT 
COLUMBUS, feverish, lies on the bunk.  He shivers violently.  FERNANDO anxiously watches over him, bathes his eyes. 
Suddenly THE TRANSLATOR enters. 
TRANSLATOR I help. 
A little reluctantly, FERNANDO lets him go to his FATHER. The INDIAN crouches over the bed, takes out a handful of leaves from a pouch.  He chews the leaves himself for a moment, until they form a sticky pulp, then opens COLUMBUS' mouth and puts the pulp inside, encouraging COLUMBUS to chew with the motions of his hands. 
COLUMBUS chews, quickly falling asleep. 
EXT.  MOONLIT VISION OF VAST LAND MASS - NIGHT 
We see things from COLUMBUS' hallucination.  We are plunging through layers of clouds, the speed accelerating, giving us a sickening sensation of falling to land, closer and closer... 
COLUMBUS wakes up with a jolt.  Everything is silent. COLUMBUS walks outside. 
EXT.  DECK - NIGHT 
COLUMBUS' fever has subsided.  He raises his head and stares at the mainland passing in the night.  He smiles. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  JUNGLE AND BAY - HIGH WIDE SHOT - DAY 
The roof of the jungle, the bay beyond, the caravel at anchor. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  RIVER - DAY 
Two canoes going upstream, deeper and deeper into the jungle. 
EXT.  JUNGLE AND VILLAGE - DAY 
Smoke rises lazily above the trees. 
CUT TO: 
The boats reaching the bank.  THE FIRST HUTS of a village. THE SOLDIERS spread out into the empty village. 
FERNANDO, COLUMBUS and MENDEZ preceded by TWO ARMED SOLDIERS enter one of the huts.  The remains of a meal is still warm in bowls on the matted floor. 
A famished SOLDIER dips his hand in one of the bowls and devours its contents:  some kind of stew.  Stepping back accidentally, FERNANDO bumps into a large earthen jar behind him.  It rolls and crashes, revealing the remains of meat marinating in liquid.  There is something disturbing about the appearance of the content. 
FERNANDO Oh my God... 
The remains of human beings. 
COLUMBUS (approaching) What is...? 
He stares at the remains, stunned.  THE SOLDIER stops chewing.  He drops the half-empty bowl he was still holding.  He runs at the back door, rams his fingers deep in the back of his throat, and vomits. 
SOLDIER Oh Virgen Maria... Oh Madre de Dios... (Oh Virgin Mary... Oh Mother of God...) 
But as he vomits and cries, he notices: 
A HEADLESS HUMAN TRUNK spread open, like a sheep carcass. Disturbed flies rise in clouds. 
SOLDIER Jesus, Maria, y todos los Santos... (Jesus, Mary, and all the Saints...) 
We see a large amphitheater, filled with PEOPLE attending a lecture of "Nova Geographica" -- the new geography. 
AROJAZ stands in front of the assembly.  Facing him, enthroned, is KING FERDINAND, surrounded by COURTIERS, including SANCHEZ. 
We slowly move across the arena, passing attentive faces. 
AROJAZ ... West by south west for 750 leagues to Santo Domingo.  From there, west north west, leaving San Juan to the north, reaching the island of Hispanola on the northern cape of San Raphael... Then onto the mainland, at the Cape called Gracias a Dios... 
We continue to rise up the tiers of seats... 
AROJAZ Spain -- by Your Majesty's grace -- has confirmed for all humanity the existence of an unknown continent... Tierra Incognita... 
On a highest tier, we stop on the face of CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, listening impassively. 
AROJAZ ... This continent was first discovered by a sailor commissioned by your Majesty... 
CLOSE ON COLUMBUS' eyes. 
AROJAZ His name... Amerigo Vespucci... 
On COLUMBUS. 
EXT.  UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY 
Around the KING, on horseback, surrounded by the KNIGHTS, a CROWD is kept back by SOLDIERS.  AROJAZ is mounting his horse.  SANCHEZ is waiting for him. 
COLUMBUS stands among the students at the back of the CROWD. 
CUT TO: 
AROJAZ rides next to SANCHEZ.  AROJAZ suddenly spots COLUMBUS in the crowd, as they move off. 
AROJAZ My God...!  I thought he was dead. 
They pass close enough to touch COLUMBUS.  But he does not see them. 
SANCHEZ You can see for yourself. 
AROJAZ What a tragedy... what a waste of a life... 
SANCHEZ A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his. 
AROJAZ looks at SANCHEZ in surprise -- then cranes his neck round, and looks back at COLUMBUS -- now a FACE IN THE CROWD. 
EXT.  LA RABIDA MONASTERY - KITCHEN GARDEN - DAY 
ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a very old man now, is taking a siesta next to his grapes.  He is sitting in a simple armchair, a rosary wrapped around his fingers. 
The presence of someone wakes him.  After a moment, he recognizes COLUMBUS and smiles.  Both MEN are very moved. 
MARCHENA I suppose we're both old men now. 
COLUMBUS You'll always be older than me, Father. 
They laugh.  COLUMBUS sits down.  Bees drone lazily in the sunlight. 
COLUMBUS Have you ever forgiven me? 
MARCHENA nods his head. 
MARCHENA Yes.  I forgave you a long time ago. You see, I was proud of you.  You were like a willful child.  You wouldn't accept what others told you.  You had to find things out for yourself, hurting yourself -- and others -- in the process. 
MARCHENA looks at his plants, sighs contentedly. 
MARCHENA Do you remember when you said that people talk about the world, but never leave their gardens. 
COLUMBUS nods. 
MARCHENA More than ever I wonder what it is we do achieve by leaving our gardens... The world changes -- and yet it seems the same.  We find new worlds, but fill them with the same people... 
He pauses, looks across at COLUMBUS, smiles again gently. MARCHENA, tiring, leans back in his chair, and looks up towards the sun. 
COLUMBUS I have to disagree. 
MARCHENA I knew you would. 
COLUMBUS New worlds create new people. 
MARCHENA Oh?  So you are a new man?

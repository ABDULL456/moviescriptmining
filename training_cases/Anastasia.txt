ANASTASIA 
FADE IN: 
on a well-worn PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM. An ELDERLY WOMAN'S HAND touched the album, caressing it lovingly for a moment, as WE HEAR her voice. 
TATIANA (O.C.) Once we lived in an enchanted world. . . 
She opend the ALBUM to reveal a BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH of the PALACE AT ST. PETERSBERG on a brilliant summer day. 
TATIANA (CONT) A world of Tsars and Princesses and elegant palaces. . . 
CAMERA MOVES CLOSER TO the picture. . . 
TATIANA (CONT) and grand parties. . . 
The PHOTO dissolves into REALITY in brilliant color as the day turns into night and the summer cools into winter. We see the palace at night, blanketed in a beautiful, almost glowing, snow as hourse drawn carriages pull up to the front door. 
TATIANA (CONT) A beautiful, magical time. . . 
MOVE INTO THE PALACE 
TATIANA (CONT) That would soon be gone forever. . . 
INT.  PALACE AT ST. PETERSBERG - NIGHT 
Elegant ROYALISTS mingle around the MAIN HALL as an ORCHESTRA plays. 
All eyes turn to the GLASS DOORS OF TWO ELEVADORS which descend grandly on either side of a beautiful staircase. Through the glass doors we see TATIANA, the Dowager Empress, 60, imperious and bedecked with jewels, she is seemingly unapproachable. TSAR NICHOLAS and his SON are with her. In the other elevador, ALEXANDRA and her daughters - well,  all her daughters except. . . 
ANASTASIA, eight years old and apparently late for the party, rushes down the upstairs hallway followed by a SERVENT (SONYA) 16,  who is trying to catch up with Anastasia to tie a large ribbon in her long, dark hair. 
SONYA (whispering) Princess Anastasia - you're late and it's all my  fault! 
ANASTASIA Don't worry, Sonya, no one'll notice. . . 
Just then, Sonya lassoes the ribbon around her hair, stopping Anastasia with a 
ANASTASIA (loudly) . . .  owwwwwwwww! 
All eyes turn to Anastasia, who once she realizes that she's the center of attention, flashes a mischievous smile and descends the staircase in grand style. As the ribbon falls out of her hair and down her back, Anastasia kicks it to Sonya without breaking stride. 
Tatiana sees her and can't help but smile. 
The music suddenly becomes  a FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS. SERVENTS open the elevador doors as the ROYAL FAMILY steps out and begins a proccession through their subjects. Tatiana holds out her arm to Anastasia as she makes it to Tatiana's side just in time. Anastasia has a beautiful but slightly impish face, dominated by large, blue, mischievous eyes. She an abundance of energy and confidence for a girl her age. 
"THE RULARS OF RUSSIA"  (OPENING NUMBER) 
The elegant guests sing their admiration as the beautiful and happy Romanov family makes it's entrance into the ball, they're "the  pride of all Russia". Vladimir invites Sophie to dance and the entire glittering assembly assembly swings into a GLORIOUS SWEEPING WALTZ. Singing their certainty that the Romanovs will rule forever. 
During the above, the ball is in full swing. Beautiful COUPLES swirls across the dance floor, including Anastasia dancing gracefully with her father. 
Phlegmenkof advances on Gregor.  Anya takes the scrub brush and SHOVES it across the floor, right under Phlegmenkof's unsuspecting foot.  Phlegmenkof's feet fly out from under her and she SMASHES to the floor. Gregor hops over her huge body and runs to Anya for safety. 
Some of the OTHER KIDS glance over. A CHUBBY GIRL and a very pretty LITTLE GIRL, look at Anya with greeat admiration . . .  someof the OTHERS think she's crazy. 
Phlegmenkof rises, covered with soap bubbles , and spins on Anya - who gives her a very innocent smile. 
PHLEGMENKOF (CONT.) You! You did this! 
Some of the OTHER CHILDREN laugh as soap bubbles fly off the enraged woman.  She spins on them, her back to Anya. 
PHLEGMENKOF (CONT.) Brats!  There'll be no supper for any of you!  Back to work! 
Anya, behind Phlegmenkof, mimics her outraged face and angry gestures perfectly - as the CHILDREN laugh harder. 
Phlegmenkof spins and almost catches Anya.  She advances on Anya as Gregor hides behind her legs. 
ANYA Don't touch him. 
PHLEGMENKOF (to Anya) You ragged, skinny, little nothing!  I have had just about enough of you . . . 
Phlegmenkof raises her hand to slap Anya, who hold her ground.  Suddenly, Phlegmenkof SNIFFS the air. 
ON THE KIDS 
as the horrible smell reaches them too.  They all make faces and hold their noses. 
ON PHLEGMENKOF 
who first sniffs under her raised arm, then realized the cause of the stench . . . 
PHLEGMENKOF (CONT.) Comrade Serebreakov! 
She tries to straighten herself out nervously - this must be someone very important. 
COMRADE SEREBREAKOV stands in the doorway, lecherously eyeing the girls.  He is a huge, fleshly man with facial features which are reminiscent of a fish. 
PHLEGMENKOF  (CONT.) (flirting) Comrade Serebreakov!  What a lovely surprise! What brings you here? 
SEREBREAKOV I need. . . a worker. 
His eye catches Anya. He looks her up and down, his beady eyes showing a touch of lust for her. 
SEREBREAKOV (CONT.) I will take her. 
He leans close close to Anya. 
SEREBREAKOV (CONT.) Tomorrow you begin your life's work in my hearing factory. You'll start by cutting off the tails - but if I'm pleased with (MORE) 
SEREBREAKOV (CONT.) you - you just may move up to cutting off the heads.  How does that sound? 
ANYA About as bad as you smell! 
Anya smiles lovingly at the children. 
"A SOMEPLACE AND A SOMEONE" 
(Anya's "I want" song).  Anya SINGS SOFTLY to the children about how all she has is the key around her neck to the "someone and thesomeplace" she was "lost from long ago".  She tells the children that she must go find them again. 
UNDERSCORE continues. 
ANYA I have to go now, before it gets light. 
GREGOR (worried) But what if we can't ever find where we came from?! 
ANYA Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do. 
Anya embraces the children and walks to the window. 
GREGOR (nervous, sad) Anya! What if we can't find anyone who loves us?! 
ANYA Then come find me. 
Gregor is relieved and cuddles into his bed as Anya smiles lovingly and crawls out the window. 
EXT.  ORPHANAGE - NIGHT 
Anya begins to climb down the street, testing the knots. The knotshold tight, but the old sheet RIPS in half, sending her PLUMMETING into a snow drift.  From the depths of the snow we HEAR her voice. 
ANYA (O.C.) I hope there's no snow in Paris. . . 
EXT.  HILLSIDE - DAWN 
A glorious bright (and cold) dawn creeps over the horizon. Anya stands at  edge of the hill, looking down on the city of ST.PETERSBURG. The old gray orphanage looms behind her. Anya "borrows" an old, beat-up bicycle from the orphanage and rides down the hill. 
Music picks up in energy and excitement as Anya zooms on her way bumping and bouncing downhill as the sunrises and St. Petersburg looms nearer. 
"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE" (CONT.) 
Music becomes UPTEMPO, HOPEFUL, ACTIVE, ACTIVE. Anya SINGS - - full of hope, energy and excitement as she peddls her rickety bike toward the city. "Her heart is on its way" and nothing is going to stop her. 
Anya passes though the countryside toward the city. A peasant family waves to her as she goes by. A Gypsy Troupe performs tricks by the side of the road. A very fancy car zooms by. 
"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE" (CONT.) 
Anya SINGS, imagining who she might be -- anyone from a peasant to a princess! But it doesn't matter as long as she finds her real family. 
People stare at her as she rides into the edge of the city. She is captivated by all the activity:  cars, busses, stores, long lines of people, etc. 
"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE"  (CONT.) 
Anya SINGS -- in this sea faces, there must be someone who has a clue to her identity.  She'll stop at nothing to find the someone who once loved her.  SOARING MUSICAL AND VOCAL CONCLUSION. END MUSICAL NUMBER 
Anya does not see a cute little PUPPY (MEETOO) with a HUGE BONE in his mouth, being chased along the sidewalk by a pack of much larger, vicious DOGS until he bolts across Anya's path forcing her to skid to a stop. She watched him as he scoots into an alley, followed by the angry pack. 
ANYA To Paris. I have to get to Paris 
PEASANT 5, in front of her, turns around. 
PEASANT 5 Paris?!  What do they have in Paris that they don't have here? 
PEASANT 6 Shorter lines?! 
Peasant 6 is immediately carted off by TWO ARMED GUARDS for his blasphamy against the state. 
PEASANT 7 (quietly) Nobody leaves Soviet Russia. 
The OTHER PEASANTS join in with variations of "Nobody leaves Russia" as Anya reaches the window and speaks to the clerk. 
ANYA Is this where I get traveling papers? 
CLERK It would be if we let you travel which we  don't so it isn't. (loudly, for all to hear) Russia is the people's paradise! 
And to further make his point, he slams shut his window, which immediately opens a crack as he whispers to Anya. 
CLERK (CONT.) See Dmitri. He can help. 
He shuts the window, only to open it again immediately. 
CLERK (CONT.) But you didn't hear it from me. 
He shuts the window. 
ANYA (doesn't get it) I didn't 
He opens it again. 
CLERK No. 
The clerk sticks out a sign:  "Samovar Break - back in ten minutes" and slams the window shut. 
EXT.  BUREAU OF BUREAUCRACY 
Anya steps out of the building, still not seeing Meetoo and looks around at the hoards of people waiting in lines for everything:  bread, gas, clothes, etc. 
ANYA (to herself) Dmitri? There must be a million Dmitris. . . 
FOLLOW ANYA 
as she wades into the crowded street. Meetoo getting tangled in the legs of waiting Soviets. 
Anya stops suddenly. She sniffs the air.  Her eyes widen as she recognizes the stench that is floating through the air.  She spins around and sees Serebreakov DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET. 
Serebreakov is on a mission to find Anya.  He turns in her direction just as a bus passes.  Anya is gone. 
We now see Anya clinging to the side of the bus as it drives down the street. Meetoo looks, his face dropping - he knows he'll never catch up to her now.  Then he sees the bus hit a huge pothole and Anya is knocked off into the mud.  Happily, Meetoo trots off in her direction. 
INT.  ST. PETERSBURG ART THEATRE 
The waiting room is filled with YOUNG WOMEN, of various shapes and sizes, holding reading aloud from a piece of paper. WE HEAR many variations of "Oh, Grandmama! It's me, Anastasia. I've waited so long to see you". 
INT.  STAGE 
An ACTRESS stands in front of what looks to be an OLD WOMAN in a shawl who's back is to the "audience". 
ACTRESS 1 (over the top) Oh, Grandmama! It's me, Anastasia! I've waited so long to see you! 
The Actress then LUMBERS over to the OLD WOMAN, with a gait like John Wayne. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
to see the "Old Woman" is Vladimir, with a shawl over his head.  He looks older, of course, but with the same dapper mustache. He rolls his eyes. 
VLADIMIR (out to audience) Dmitri!  I can not work with her! (MORE) 
VLADIMIR (CONT.) (to Actress) May I remind you that you are supposed to be Princess - not a lazy lumbering lout! 
IN THE SEATS 
is Dmitri. Now 20 and darkly handsome. His hair still falling in his eyes as he flips it off his forehead. 
DMITRI Vladimir, calm down! 
Vladimir walks off the stage and toward Dmitri. 
VLADIMIR This, my friend, as an exercise in futility! We shall never find a girl to play the Princess Anastasia out of this motley crew of commoners! 
Vladimir dramatically throws one end of his shawl over his shoulder. 
DMITRI For a ten million rubles reward we can look a little longer. This is the big one. . .  and all I need is the right girl. 
"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE"  (REPRISE 
(Dmitri's "I want") Dmitri SINGS a reprise of Anya's song, a COMIC VERSION, in which he expresses the hope that he can find the right girl for his scam. Anyone from a peasant to a princess will do, as long as she can fool Tatiana. (NOTE:   We don't want to give Dmitri a whole new song here or we'll be too song-heavy in Act I. By giving him a short reprise of Anya's song, we can effectively align these two characters emotionally.) 
QUICK CUTS: 
of various aspirants: 
ACTRESS 2 (heavy hasal) Oh, Grandmama! It's me, Anastasia. I've waited so long to see you. 
DMITRI (O.C.) Next! 
ACTRESS 3 (stupid) Oh. . .  Grandmama it's me. Anastasia, I have waited so long, too. (as a good-bye) See you! 
DMITRI (O.C.) Next! 
ACTRESS 4 looks like a hooker and sounds like Mae West. 
They walk out the door. 
EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG ART THEATRE - CONTINUOUS 
DMITRI She could be right under our nose 
Anya is running up the stairs as Dmitri walks out and they COLLIDE:  her forehead banging Dmitri literally under his nose.  Dmitri grabs his upper lip in pain. 
DMITRI (over reacting) Ouch!  That really hurt! 
ANYA I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . . 
DMITRI That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy. 
In her old hand-me-down boys clothes andhat pulled low, she could easily be mistaken for a boy. 
ANYA (breathless) I'm looking for Dmitri.  I need traveling papers - to Paris. I heard Dmitri could help me. 
Vladimir and Dmitri exchange a look. . .  wary. . .  Dmitri looks around and motions to Vladimir to handle it while he walks ahead nonchalantly. 
VLADIMIR Who did you hear it from? 
ANYA I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri? 
Dmitri keeps walking ahead followed by Vladimir. Anya is determined not to give up and keeps up with Vladimir even though she keeps getting bumped and pulled off track by people walking in the opposite direction. 
VLADIMIR (loudly, acting) Providing travel papers is illeagal! (then, quietly) I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . . 
ANYA Well, I don't have any money . . . 
VLADIMIR Good day! 
Vladimir pats her on the head and walks away. 
ANYA I have a bike!  Perhaps I could sell it and. . . 
Vladimir keeps walking, catching up to Dmitri. 
Anya runs back around to the front of the building where she left her bike.  She stops suddenly when she realizes that there is no bicycle there anymore - just Meetoo. 
ANYA (CONT.) What are you doing here?  And where's my bike? 
A POLICEMAN strolls by. 
ANYA (CONT.) Officer!  My bike has been stolen! 
POLICEMAN Nonsense.  There is no crime in the Soviet Socialist Republic. 
And he keeps walking. Anya realizes that there is no hope in pursuing the policeman so she heads off to find Vladimir - who has vanished down the street.  Meetoo starts to follow her. 
ANYA Sorry, boy, I have to go. 
DMITRI Look! 
Vladimir looks at Anya again and get it. 
ANYA Are you Dmitri?  I didn't  mean to trespass - I don't want to do anything dishonest, but if you could just help help me. . . 
Vladimir and Dmitri walk down the stairs and up her stairs and begin to circle around her. 
VLADIMIR Perhaps you heard of our brilliant plan to find a girl and. . . 
Dmitri pokes him hard in the ribs and shakes his head. 
DMITRI (quietly to Vlad) She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . . 
VLADIMIR (gets it, whispers) Ew. . .  the honest type. 
Dmitri gives Vlad a "let me handle this" gestures. 
DMITRI (off frieze) You look like her.  Like the Princess Anastasia.  Has anyone ever told you that before? 
Anya is coming back to her senses, doesn't like these men circling her. 
ANYA (sarcastic) Oh, yeah - in the orphanage they constantly told me I looked like a princess! Stop that! 
Dmitri stops circling and then begins to use everything that Anya says - the perfect and charming con man that he is - to get what he wants. 
DMITRI People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too (MORE) 
DMITRI (CONT.) (beat) What happened to your parents? 
ANYA I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . . 
DMITRI You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother? 
ANYA I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me. 
DMITRI Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . . 
VLADIMIR How much do you weigh? 
Dmitri pokes him again. 
VLADIMIR (CONT.) (to Dmitri) I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . . 
ANYA Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . . 
DMITRI Why do you want to go to Paris? 
ANYA (defiant) I have my reasons. 
DMITRI Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.  We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris. (MORE) 
Bartok screws up his courage and flies into the open window of the BLACK WAGON 
ANYA (singing in a whisper) THINGS MY HEART USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARNS TO REMEMBER ... 
Dmitri looks at Anya, her back toward him, as he raises his arm to her. 
DMITRI Find out the truth - come to Paris with us. 
Anya expression registers her internal debate. What if it's true... It couldn't be... but if... Then, 
ANYA All right. I will go with you. 
Meetoo lets out his "retu". Vladimir lets out a whoop of joy. Dmitri smiles and bows to Anya. 
DMITRI The Her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia! 
ON BARTOK 
having watched the whole thing - he sighs. 
BARTOK Oy. . .  he's gonna be so mad... 
Bartok flies out a broken window and into the night. 
EXT.	AERIAL VIEW OF ST. PETERSBURG - NIGHT 
BARTOK'S POV 
The city lights fade and we move into the blackness of the Russian forest. Finally, in the distance. we see the orange glow of a fire. 
EXT.	GYPSY CAMP - NIGHT 
Bartok swoops along the wagons. Everyone looks to be asleep. Bartok keeps flying until he sees an ONIOUS LOOKING BLACK WAGON, the largest and most elaborate. 
Bartok screws up his courage and flies into the open window of the BLACK WAGON. 
INT.	RASPUTIN'S WAGON 
A lone candle lights the dark wagon. A frightened Bartok, stays on the window sill. 
BARTOK Ummm ... Father Gregori? It's, uhh ... me. Bartok. (a sign of relief) Phew! Not home ... 
Rasputin's face suddenly ROARS into FRAME from the bed below, his eyes fiery red and his beard wild. 
RASPUTIN What? 
BARTOK Oh my God! (wing to chest) Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ... 
RASPUTIN (smiling) And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings? 
Rasputin rises and pours himself a glass of vodka. 
SCARY NUMBER in whIch he SINGS of his obsession with killing the Romanovs once and for all. Bartok will interject comically throughouut. as Rasputin will conjure up tLis minions from the iquary and sing about Romanovs FINALE, he sends them off after Anya. 
SONG TO INCORPORATE THE FOLLOWING SENTIMENTS: 
RASPUTIN The Romanovs tried to kill me and I swore to destroy all of them! If she lives, if she should have a child someday, the Romanov Family continues! And I won't lot that happen! THIS IS THE END OF THE LINE! 
He crushes the Anastasia doll in his massive hand. 
BARTOK You know, this is really obsessive behavior. There is this doctor this doctor in Austria, Sigmund something and he feels. . . 
Bartok land on the table while be's talking and his wing accidently knocks the RELIQUARY on its side and it begins to roll. 
RASPUTIN YOU IDIOT 
Rasputin makes a sad leap, grabbing it seconds before it shatters on the floor.	Rasputin holds it up. The smokey SPIRITS inside swirl around, moaning. 
RASPUTIN (CONT.) (to Reliquary) Yesses - you'd all like to get out, wouldn' t you? Sorry just one at a time and only when I call. 
Rasputin spins an Bartok, who Us been slinki away, and slams a goblet over his. 
BARTOK'S POV 
From under the glass, Rasputin looks distorted and even more horrifying. 
RASPUTIN (to Bartok) Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?! 
BARTOK (voice under glass) You'd lose your security deposit? 
RASPUTIN (waving reliquary) Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ... 
Rasputin smiles with his horrible yellow, decayed teeth, and lifts the glass an if to whisper in Bartok, a ear. 
RASPUTIN (CONT.) YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND IF THAT HAPPENS! 
The volume of Rasputin's voice rattles Bartok around the inside of the glass. Rasputin focuses on the RELIQUARY. 
RASPUTIN (CON'T.) (to reliquary) Where is she? Where is Princess Anastasia... 
Inside the reliquary the awoke begins to mow Suddenly, the smoke EXPLODES in a burst and forms into the smoke from a train engine. As the reliquary picture broadens, we see a train and Anya, Dmitri and Vladimir all hurrying to catch it. 
RASPUTIN(CONT.) She has friends. No matter... 
Bartok looks desperate under glass. He trios to topple the glass prism by jumping up but just cooks his head. 
BARTOK Ohhh, that was dumb... 
BARTOK (CONT.) (calling to Rasputin) Hello, I've get really terrible claustrophobia. That's why I could never live in a cave ... 
Rasputin gives his attention only to the reliquary. 
RASPUTIN Finish my prophecy... 
DMITRI Hurry up with those papers. 
VLADIMIR Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster? 
Vladimir looks at Dmitri's anxious face. 
VLADIMIR (CONT.) You probably would. (hands his the papers) They're still wet. 
A TRAIN WHISTLE SLOWS and Vlad Moves to Anya. 
VLADIMIR (CONT.) Wake up, young lady, that's our train. 
DMITRI (correcting) "Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it. 
VLADIMIR What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness". 
Dmitri leans over and tugs Anya's hair lightly. 
DMITRI (to Anya) Wake up! 
Anya's  eyes flash open and - totally on reflex - she belts Dmitri in the nose. Ditri reels back,  lands on his butt - Vladimir observes ruefully. 
VLADIMER We have a lot of work to do... 
EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM - SECONDS LATER 
Vladimir, using his ample belly, bumps people out of the way as they head for the train. Vlad climbs on just as it starts up, followed	by Dmitri. Dmitri turns back and reaches out his hand to help Anya up. But she freezes... just STANDS THERE, not running. 
ANYA'S POV 
DMITRI Come on! 
Dmitri on the train, his band extended - just like Tatiana's was. Although Anya can't quite remember, something about this terrifies bar. She snaps out of it when Meetoo nips her ankle. 
Anya looks down and sees the puppy, picks his up and runs for the train. 
DMITRI Take my hand! 
Anya puts Meetoo into his hands and Jumps on without touching his. 
INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT 
The compartment is JAMMED with travelers. Suitcases and packages balanced precariously. Dmitri sits down and carefully touches his painful noso. 
DMITRI Do you always punch people first thing in the morning? 
ANYA Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging. 
DMITRI I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up! 
OVER ANYA'S SHOULDER, out of the window. we see the THREE MINIONS on horseback charging down a snow covered hill toward the train. 
As the Guard heads out of the compartment, Vlad turns to Dmitri and they exchange an "oh, no" look. 
INT. CORRIDOR, ANOTHER CAR 
The MINIONS, hoods pulled low, push their way through the PASSENGERS in search of Anastasia. 
INT. CORRIDOR 
Dmitri spots the GUARD conferring with the GUARDS over the papers. Anya pokes bar head out. 
ANYA I'm going to stretch my legs 
DMITRI That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs (pointing the opposite direction of the guards) ... stretch then that way. 
Anya looks at him like he's crazy and walks away. 
ANYA (to herself) I must have hit him harder than I thought... 
Dmitri runs back in and grabs his SMALL BACKPACK. He pulls Vlad, carrying Meetoo, out off the compartment Anya has a load on them as they follow. 
INT TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY 
The GUARDS burst in, ready for an arrest. In the background, the hooded Minions pass. The Guards, seeing empty seats, head back out. 
INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - ANOTHER CAR 
Anya looks out the window as the country side flies by and smiles. 
INT. CORRIDOR 
The Guards spot three figures at the far end of the car. 
GUARD That's them! Come on! 
They run after who they think are the fugitives. The Guard grabs a minion and spins him around. 
It's MINION THREE, who comes face-to-beak with him and lets out a HORRENDOUS SCREECH, causing the other Minion to turn around. The Guards scream and reel backward, pushing and shoving each other to got out of the way 
The Minions proceed up the corridor, MINION TWO, spot Anya looking out the window. He grabs her. palling her viciously to the other Minions. She spins around - it isn't Anya - it's a SERIOUSLY UGLY WOMAN. The Minions now scream and reel back in horror. 
INT. CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS 
Dmitri and Vladimir catch up to Anya and grab her in each arm, loading bar down the hall WE HEAR the MINIONS SCREAM from the next car. 
EXT. BETWEEN CARS 
Anya. Dmitri and Vlad step out on a platform and see there is no place left to run. Only the engine is ahead of them. 
DMITRI Wait here! 
He leaps up gracefully, grabbing the edge of the roof, and pull& himself up. 
ON THE MINIONS 
now on the roof, seeing their prey in short distance. 
ON ANYA AND THE OTHERS 
running, without looking back. jumping from car to car, passing Meetoo like a football. Vladiair makes a huge running leap into the air... 
INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT 
As all PASSENGERS react to Vladimir's bulk hitting and denting the coiling. 
EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN 
The TRAIN WHISTLE erupts and Anya glances back to see her pursuers just as they are enveloped in the thick black smoke of the engine. Behind them, Anya can another tunnel. 
TUNNEL 
They drop down, this time Vlad in on his stomach. Anya and Dmitri realize his butt won't clear the tunnel. They push it down. 
ON THE MINIONS 
An the smoke disappears, the Minions' eyes go wide when they realize it's too late for them. The train roars the tunnel as the MINIONS SMASH &"'not the sift of 
the mountain in a COLORFUL BURST OF SMOKE from which they were created. 
INT. RASPUTIN'S WAGON - PARALLEL TIME 
DISSOLVE TO 
EXT.	ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY 
Rasputin stares at the scene in his reliquary, watching his well laid plan *go up in smoke", and lots out a simmering growl. 
Anya is standing with her hands an her hips arguing with Dmitri and Vladiair. 
ANYA Forged papers! Now, what?! 
DMITRI Now just get off the train. 
ANYA HUH?! 
Dmitri motions that they are going to Jump. Anya shakes her head slowly. 
ANYA Noooo.... 
VLADIMIR She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to 
Dmitri shoves him off the top of the train with Meetoo in his arm. Dmitri then puts out his hand to Anya. 
DMITRI Come on, we'll jump together... Take my hand. 
Rasputin, on his obsessed mission, leaps on top of the wagon as Bartok, still dizzy, tries to catch up. 
RASPUTIN We'll catch her and finish her! (he grabs the, reigns) We ride this night! 
Rasputin then looks down and sees that there are no horses harnessed he gave then to the begins a slow growl. 
BARTOK Well,	we wait this night! 
EXT.	COUNTRY - BREAK OF DAWN 
Anya is walking ahead with Vladiair as Dmitri follows he's still muddy, wet and unhappy. 
VLADIMIR No have a lot of work to do, Anya! Come along, Meetoo! 
Meetoo is trying to catch fire flies in his mouth. 
VLADIMIR (CONT.) We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie. 
ANYA Who's Sophie? 
VLADIMIR (lost in warm memories) Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean. 
Anya stops dead in her tracks, this is the first she's heard of this. 
ANYA What?! 
Dmitri, not paying attention, slams into the back of Anya. Anya, not hurt, turns to Dmitri - who is rubbing his now sore shoulder. 
ANYA (CONT.) You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess! 
DMITRI You are the Princess. 
VLADIMIR We're just going to refresh your memory... 
ANYA I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess! (looks down at herself) Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly... 
Anya searches for the -word as she sits down next to a frozen pond. 
ANYA (CONT.) (sadly to herself) ... good enough... (to others) I can't go through with this! 
Dmitri sits next to Anya and looks at her reflection in the ice. 
DMITRI What do you see? 
ANYA'S POV 
her smudged face and boy's clothes. Dmitri's hands come into frame, wipe off her face with snow and them pull her hair off her face. Anya does, truly, look pretty. 
DMITRI(CONT.) See? The Princess is under there ... 
VLADIMIR Ah! Let us begin! 
Meetoo spots TWO UGLY PUG DOGS and a distinguished ELDERLY DOWAGER. He runs happily to play with them. She pulls her DOGS away from Meetoo. 
ELDERLY DOWAGER No, no, boys! You don't know where he's been! 
They give him a disgusted look and walk away. Meetoo looks a little hurt. 
INT. HALLWAY OF THE SHIP - NIGHT 
Dmitri and Vladimir are standing by a closed door. Anya is on the other side. 
ANYA (0. C.) No! I look ridiculous! 
VLADIMIR Come out! I can do alterations. 
ANYA (O.C.) You'll laugh. 
VLADIMIR I shant! 
ANYA (O.C.) Not you. Him. 
DMITRI I won't laugh - I swear... 
The door opens and Anya comes out in the blue dress Dmitri stole which at least ten sizes too big for her. She is still wearing her hair up and despite the size which actually gives her a "Kate Moss" waifish look with her men's boots and baggy dress - the blue brings out her eyes. Dmitri sees her and BUSTS OUT LAUGHING. 
ANYA You said you wouldn't laugh! 
DMITRI It's not you - it's the dress! 
Anya storms back into the cabin and slam the door behind her. 
INT.	CABIN - SIMULTANEOUS ACTION 
When Anya storms into the cabin, she catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror. 
ANYA (to herself) I'm never going to be.. 
Just then, the slamming door catches the back of her dress, pulling more than half of it into the door frame. She sees in the mirror that the now fitted dress shows a lovely woman's figure. Pleased, she looks at herself. 
ANYA (CONT.) Well! Maybe I am... 
EXT.	CABIN DOOR - NIGHT 
Vladimir and Dmitri wait outside the door. The door opens and Anya appears, having tied the veil around the waist of the dress, making it look fitted and beautiful. Dmitri and Vladimir are surprised as Anya walks past them with confidence and throws them a look over her shoulder. 
"REPRISE OF VLADIMIR'S SONG (OVER MONTAGE) 
The tone of the song would now change - - the older, wiser person watching as two younger people are unwittingly falling in love. The tone can still be light, as are the visuals here, but there would be an undercurrent of irony and romance. The song would end as Anya and Dmitri have their first, momentary embrace. 
MONTAGE: (MOS) 
ON DECK: Anya, still in her boots, walks gracefully down the deck in spite of the ship's rocking motion. Dmitri and Vlad can't even stand due to the motion. Anya looks back and flashes them a smile. 
EXT.	SEA CLIFF - NIGHT 
The wagon sits on the edge of a high cliff. Rasputin stands on the top of his wagon, staring at the sea demonically. The jagged bolts of lightening and the icy silver rain make him look all the more menacing. 
RASPUTIN (low, slow) She's out there ... 
The wind parts his beard and we see Bartok hanging upside down in it, trying to stay out of the storm. 
BARTOK I'm getting a chest cold.. 
RASPUTIN Bartok... a question. 
BARTOK I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead... 
RASPUTIN What do you think is the most humiliating way to die? 
Rasputin's eyes light up as if he just thought of the answer to his own question. Bartok is thrown out of his beard when he makes a sudden turn and leaps off the wagon. Bartok follows. 
BARTOK My cousin Mischa, nice fellow had some dental problems - you didn't want to watch him eat, let's put it that way... 
Rasputin steps in 
INT.	WAGON - NIGHT 
As Bartok continues, Rasputin moves to the reliquary's cabinet. 
BARTOK ... anyway, a bunch of other bats were hanging in the belfry - I know, cliche, but there you have it, and Mischa, not the brightest bat in the world, decides to hang in the bell. Which was fine for awhile until it started ringing ... (shivers) Ewwww, what a mess ... 
RASPUTTN (to reliquary) Show her to me ... 
BARTOK And it didn't help the tonal quality of the bell, either. 
IMAGES, horrifying and frightening, begin to spin into a small tornado. Rasputin throws open the door and the TORNADO bursts out streaking across the water. 
EXT.	SEA CLIFF - NIGHT 
Rasputin follows tornado to the cliff and watches as it disappears into the horizon of the water. Lightning and thunder crash as he laughs maniacally. 
INT.	CABIN - NIGHT 
which is swaying with the storm. PAN past Vladimir, snoring, his now limp mustache flopping wildly and past Dmitri, sleeping restlessly. Move to Anya, who seems quite content. 
From under the door SMOKY IMAGES silently slither. They float across the cabin and swirl around Anya. 
CLOSE ON: 
Anya's CLOSED EYES as the SMOKY IMAGES seem to enter her head. She smiles in her sleep and we are in ANYA'S DREAM. . . 
EXT.	FOREST - DAY 
Anya, in a beautiful white dress, is walking peacefully through a sunny part of a lovely forest on a spring day. She reaches down to pick some pretty flowers, then looks up as it seems to get dark... OMINOUS LOOKING CLOUDS cover the sun. Anya reaches down for another flower when she HEARS A GROWL. 
DMITRI If you have to go - wake her.. 
Dmitri looks over to Anya's bed - she isn't sits up and throws his legs over the side 
EXT. DECK 
Anya is standing right on the edge of death... 
IN HER DREAM 
She isn't there. He of his bed. 
the FAMILY is waving to her. NICHOLAS waves for her to jump into the clear pond and join them. Anya nods and moves to jump in... 
EXT. DECK 
Anya gets ready to jump into the violent and icy black waves. She takes one step out when... DMITRI GRABS HER SHOULDERS. 
Anya JOLTS awake from her dream. Confused at first, then terrified to see what almost happened to her. isn't lifts her to the other side of the railing and looks at her. 
DMITRI What were you doing?! 
Anya puts her hands to her mouth in shock, shaking and almost crying with fear, she throws her arms around Dmitri and holds him tightly. 
Dmitri is surprised at first, but tightens his arms around her. 
DMITRI (CONT.) It's okay now - I've got you. You're safe... 
They stand steady on the deck in a tight embrace, their feelings for each other are stronger than the storm. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
THE SAME, as seen through the reliquary 
Rasputin watches ... seething quietly, as Bartok peeks meekly over his shoulder. 
BARTOK Boy, don't you hate it when that happens? 
RASPUTIN (controlling) She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him. 
Rasputin studies Dmitri in the reliquary - Dmitri and Anya still in a warm embrace. 
BARTOK Nice looking fellow. I mean, don't get me wrong - I'm not attracted to him in the physical sense, I just ... 
But Rasputin's not interested, he stares into the reliquary and speaks directly to it. 
RASPUTIN You are toying with me, aren't you? You let me get so close... 
The reliquary, as if in answer, seem to be chuckling. Rasputin smiles and joins in with it. 
RASPUTIN (CONT.) Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris? 
MINUTES LATER 
Dmitri hands Vlad a pile of FRANCS as Anya approaches. 
ANYA That was really very kind of you. 
She gives him a kiss on the cheek and walks away with Meetoo, who turns back and gives Dmitri a look. A little guilty, Dmitri turns to Vlad. 
VLADIMIR I won't say a word... 
EXT.	GRAND OPEN CAR - DAY 
Traveling is style! Vladimir is driving - badly - with Meetoo in the front seat. Meetoo covers his eyes. Dmitri and Anya are in the open back seat, enjoying the beautiful French countryside. 
Dmitri looks over at Anya. 
DMITRI Nervous? 
ANYA Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana.... 
DMITRI You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know. 
Anya smiles at Dmitri, knowing that all the confidence she has is because of him. She takes his hand but looks away. 
EXT. TATIANA'S PARIS HOUSE - DAY 
They pull up in front of the beautiful white house. Anya is nervous as Vladimir walks up to the front door ahead of Dmitri and Anya. Vladimir knocks. Sophie answers the door. 
She moves with grace and regal poise. 
VLADIMIR May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia! 
SOPHIE Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days! 
Anya looks to Dmitri, a little confused by that last comment. Dmitri makes a little "she's slightly crazy" signal. 
They all leap to avoid her butt as she bustles into the house. 
INT. DRAWING ROOM - DAY 
Sophie, flanked by her sisters, sits at a table. Anya, looking nervous but poised, sits across while Dmitri and Vladimir hover nervously at the far end of the room. 
Sophie's PAT CAT, TILLIE, attempts to cuddle up next to Meetoo, who wants nothing to do with her. 
SOPHIE I'd just like to ask you a few questions, dear... 
Sophie opens a huge book that SLAMS open. Vlad and Dmitri jump. 
ANYA Of course. 
SOPHIE Where were you born?

Britain the Dark Ages 
The Roman Empire has fallen. 
The land lies in ruins, divided amoung feuding tribes. 
To the west, Ireland has flourished untouched by the Romans, protected by the sea. 
Led by their powerful and ruthless King, the Irish have subdued the Britons. 
Knowing that if Ireland is to prosper, the tribes must never be allowed to unite. 
[Scene showing images of mountains. A young boy Tristan hunts with his father for a rabbit] 
ARAGON A year younger than I was for my first. 
TRISTAN When can I have a stag? 
ARAGON a stag? 
TRISTAN Oh come on! 
[The two walk home through the mountains. Main title appears] TRISTAN + ISOLDE 
TRISTAN Why would they join up against the Irish? 
LADY MARKE We heard the news... 
TRISTAN Mother, I made this for you 
[Lady Marke smiles and touches Tristans face lovingly] 
[In the Main Hall of Aragon, the assembled tribe Lords gather in meet] 
ARAGON Friends, look at us. 
[A map of Britain is shown] 
ARAGON The tribes of Britain. Divided. Weak. Just as the Irish like us. But if we were one land united, we would out number them two to one. We could defeat them once and for all. That is why we are here today, to sign this treaty of unification. 
LORD But who would be King? 
ARAGON The strongest among us: Lord Marke. 
[Scene of movement outside of the town] 
ARAGON Look if you are happy sending all of your gold to Ireland, living as slaves then by all means do nothing. 
BARON If we were happy doing that then we would never have risked coming here. 
MARKE Friends. My wife is with child, my heart tells me it is a boy. I want him to grow old in a land where all of us, all the tribes: Pict, Celt, Angle, Jute, Saxon are at peace. This island has not known unity since the Romans left. That is why I sign this treaty. 
WICTRED And why should we follow you? 
MARKE Perhaps, Wictred, because your last attempt to form an alliance without the knowledge of half the Barons in this room has failed. 
[A man bursts into the room] 
MAN My Lord! The Irish are here! 
[Scenes of destruction outside the keep. Inside Aragon grabs Marke] 
[Isolde and Bragnae approach a cairn where Isolde lays an urn of her mothers ashes within a niche] 
BRAGNAE Your mother loved you so much Isolde 
ISOLDE Why did she die Bragnae? Why? 
BRAGNAE It was an ill fever that took her. Fever. 
ISOLDE No. It was her heart. 
[Castle Dor appears onscreen. A procession of survivors from Markes retinue return home. They find Dor in ruins. Markes sister runs up to him and cries in his arms] 
MARKE Your husband? 
[Edyth shakes her head] 
MARKE Oh sister I am so sorry. 
EDYTH: THE EXECUTIONS LASTED A DAY. * 
MARKE A whole generation of men. 
EDYTH Whos this? 
MARKE Tristan. Son of Aragon. Were his family now. 
EDYTH I have a son about your age. Melot! Melot!  Melot, this is Tristan. 
HENCHMAN What shall we do, my Lord? 
MARKE Rebuild. 
[Rebuilding is taking place. The youth are practicing their swordsmanship. Marke is testing his ability with his sword without his hand] 
MARKE Dont hold back 
[They re-emerge from the tunnel] 
MELOT Here we are: the bottom of the keep. 
TRISTAN Who else knows about this? 
SAMMY Nobody. 
TRISTAN Good. 
[They exit the keep] 
BODKIN The savages have rebuilt the castle at Cornwall, only now its made of stone. 
KING DONNCHADH Of Cornwalls next tribute I want slaves. Young ones. Their future. If Marke resists have Morholt crush him. 
MORHOLT My King. 
KING DONNCHADH Morholt. 
MORHOLT I have led your armies to victory far and near. Iv made you rich and powerful. 
KING DONNCHADH Yes you have. You have been most loyal. 
MORHOLT When I return from Cornwall, I was hoping... 
KING DONNCHADH What would please you? 
MORHOLT A wife. 
[The cairn appears once again, with a grown up Isolde leaning on it looking out to sea] 
BRAGNAE Its dark in an hour. 
ISOLDE What do you think is really out there? 
MORHOLT And you know the antidote for this? 
ISOLDE Yohimbine. 
MORHOLT Makes a hard man even harder.  The only cure... wild abandon. Till out wedding day. Im to Cornwall, to deal with rabbles. 
[The Irish arrive in Cornwall and enter the town of Castle Dor] 
BODKIN Release them. 
[The Irish men spread out and start collecting Cornish men and women as hostages] 
CORNISH MAN Leave her! 
[He is grabbed by the Irish thugs] 
BODKIN Take him there. Get a rope. Any man foolish enough to interfere in any way shall suffer the same fate. 
[A girl rushes forward] 
GIRL No! No! Please No! 
[The man is hung and Tristan rushes forward. He is held back by the Irish men. The Cornish hostages are put in a wagon] 
BODKIN If there are any more attacks we shall put our guests to death and raise this entire land. Take the horses. 
[Tristan confronts Marke about the Irish] 
MARKE When would you strike? 
TRISTAN At once. Throw everything we have at them. 
MARKE They are hoping you'll do that. On horse they outnumber us two to one. You would lead the men straight to their deaths. 
TRISTAN So we do nothing?! 
TRISTAN Simon! 
SAMMY I dont want to die. 
[Simon dies and Tristan collapses] 
MAN Tristan! 
TRISTAN I cant feel my legs or my hands. 
MAN Poison. 
TRISTAN Build a second boat. 
MAN Tristan! 
[Tristan seems to die] 
MELOT He shall have a King's service. 
[Tristan is lain on a funeral boat and floated out to sea] 
MELOT Farewell, Tristan of Aragon. Death of the Irish. 
[The boat is set alight by burning arrows. Melot turns to the captured Irish] 
MELOT When the Irish came to Cornwall and my father surrendered. You spared a dozen out of a hundred. I am even less kind. The leader and 3 shall take this message home. As for the rest... 
[The surviving British and the hostages return to Dor. Marke meets them] 
MELOT Victory. 
MARKE Tristan? 
MELOT Simon too. 
ISOLDE Any word of my betrothed? 
KING DONNCHADH Overdue. But comforted no doubt that you yearn for him. 
[The King leaves] 
[Isolde leaves the town to return to the hut on the beach. She sees Tristan bathing in the sea. Isolde tends to Tristans wounds back in the hut] 
TRISTAN What's your name? 
ISOLDE Oh, I think it's better if we don't bother with names. 
TRISTAN How can I thank you if I don't have your name? 
ISOLDE You just did. If you insist... my name is Bragnae. I'm a lady in waiting at the court. My parents are dead. My mother, she is the source of the kindness you find so puzzling. My father would've left you where you fell. 
TRISTAN Tristan of Aragon. 
ISOLDE Well Tristan of Aragon, I'd guess about you too, but I think I've already seen everything. 
BRAGNAE Sir! I hope you appreciate the risks we are taking, and will honour us by leaving as soon as you are able. 
[Bragnae leaves] 
TRISTAN She likes me. Shes right though, you do risk. 
[Finishes poulticing him] 
ISOLDE There. What of your parents? 
TRISTAN They also died when I was a child. 
ISOLDE Of what? 
TRISTAN A different type of Irish kindness. 
[Bragnae and Isolde leave] 
[Tristan and Isolde look out to sea] 
TRISTAN Youre promised? 
ISOLDE Yes. 
TRISTAN Whats he like? 
ISOLDE Dark. Tall. Nearly twice your size. An absolute gentleman. 
TRISTAN I thought... earlier when you spoke of wanting something you cant have. 
ISOLDE I didnt know what I was talking about. 
[They leave the shore and go inside the hut, Isolde is crying] 
ISOLDE Outside, just past that bluff there is a boat. Thats how you should go when you leave. You should go soon. 
[Isolde leaves but Tristan goes after her. They kiss. Inside the hut they make love.] 
TRISTAN How do you feel? 
ISOLDE I dont know 
ISOLDE Tristan! Theyve found your boat. At this very moment the King himself is scouring the coast. He will find you. He finds everyone. The tide is coming lets go! 
[They drag the boat out to see] 
TRISTAN Come with me. Come with me! 
ISOLDE I cant 
TRISTAN Why not? Please! 
WICTRED As baron of Wessex it is my duty to fight in this tournament for my people. 
MARKE For yourself you mean. 
MELOT And what of the support you promised Tristan? 
WICTRED Tristan is dead. My people have suffered enough. They see the wealth of Lyonesse as more real than any alliance. My mind is set. 
BARON And ours as well. 
MARKE So be it. 
[Tristan rides back into town] 
MELOT You're weary, let me rally your friends. Ill lead them against D... 
MARKE Ah, Melot, Melot, Melot. You are my blood and you are a noble presence but...... 
[They hear the sounds of the townspeople calling welcome to Tristan outside. Everyone rushes to Tristan] 
GUARD Lord Marke! Hes back! Its Tristan! 
MAN It cannot be! 
EDYTH Tristan! 
MELOT I saw you dead. 
TRISTAN I am delivered. 
MARKE How? How? 
[There is a celebration for Tristans return that night] 
MARKE A toast! Tristan! Back from the dead. 
TRISTAN Let me go and win you a wife. She can make peace without spilling one drop of blood, and maybe heal a wound from which you still lack. 
[The British arrive in Ireland. A henchman approaches Tristan] 
BODKIN Truce. You have safe passage. 
[The warriors enter the tournament arena] 
TRISTAN How do I look? 
HENCHMAN How do you look? 
MELOT Where is this Princess? Whats her name? Isolde? I want to see what she looks like. 
[Maids attend to Isolde as the King enters] 
BRAGNAE There. Almost done. 
ISOLDE No, not quite. If I am to be a present I should be fully wrapped. 
[The King takes his seat on the podium overlooking the arena] 
KING DONNCHADH See how the bees come to the honey. 
TRISTAN Tristan of Aragon. 
[He is given a specially prepared tablet] 
KING DONNCHADH So he lives. 
BODKIN For the moment. 
WICTRED Wictred of Glastonbury. 
[He is also given a prepared stone] 
[Wictred and Tristan work through their opponents until they face each other] 
WICTRED Mace. 
MELOT One more fight Tristan. Take deep breaths. 
HERALD Wictred: Lord of Saxonberg. Tristan: Champion of Cornwall. Warriors: Begin! 
[Tristan and Wictred fight. Wictred is booed by the crowd. Tristan defeats Wictred.] 
TRISTAN Yield! 
[Tristan goes before the King] 
KING DONNCHADH An impressive victory. Of course the man who defeats Morholt might be expected to triumph here. 
TRISTAN On behalf of Cornwall, I offer your daughter a place on our throne. The throne of England, united behind one leader. 
KING DONNCHADH Isolde! Perhaps it is just that he who took a husband provides one. 
[Isolde comes forward] 
ISOLDE Im yours. 
KING DONNCHADH No. Tristan of Aragon has won you on behalf of Lord Marke of Cornwall. 
MELOT Lets go. 
[Everyone disperses] 
KING DONNCHADH Let them take her across the sea. After the wedding I'll disavow Isolde, the alliance will crumble. 
[The English sail back to Britain with Isolde and Bragnae] 
HENCHMAN Tristan. Princess wants to speak to you. 
ISOLDE My Lord. 
MARKE Isolde? Welcome. 
[He takes her hand and everyone claps] 
[Isoldes wedding gown is prepared. Marke puts on his metal hand for the ceremony. Isolde  fully dressed- floats down the river to the wedding ceremony about a decorated ship. She and Marke go forward to be wed. There is a celebration after the wedding. As Isolde and Marke leave the party, Isolde approaches Tristan] 
ISOLDE If things were different. If we lived in a place without duty... would you be with me? 
TRISTAN That place does not exist. 
ISOLDE I'll pretend it's you. 
[Isolde and Marke retire to their bedroom. Tristan watches their window from outside] 
MARKE Youre trembling. You are far from home and I am a stranger still. But you mustnt fear me. My wish is to make you happy, as a wife.. as a women and hopefully one day, the fact that I am not whole will not offend you. 
[Marke kisses Isolde and makes love to her] 
[Marke and Isolde stand outside the keep surveying the town. Mark fingers her shell bracelet] 
MARKE Thats pretty. Did you make it? 
ISOLDE It was a present. 
[Tristan goes to Edyths home and knocks on the door] 
MAN Tristan? 
TRISTAN Might I stay here a while? 
MAN Of course. 
[There is a montage of Tristan and Isoldes lives while in Dor. Finally in the marketplace Isolde is fed food by Mark and they laugh together. Edyth sees Tristan watching] 
[Melot is very upset] 
MARKE For the first time since the Romans, this country stands united. 
[After leaving the signing, Tristan chases down Marke] 
TRISTAN I cant be your second. Melot must be. He is blood. Besides, I wish to journey north. 
MARKE You no longer sleep at Dor, and now you dont want to be my second. Do you find no comfort in your home? These stone walls that you helped build? 
TRISTAN I find these walls a prison. 
MARKE Why? 
TRISTAN Everything I want seems misplaced. 
MARKE Ever since you were a boy you sacrificed everything for me. All for one dream. Now that you reached that dream, it is natural that you would feel some loss. It doesnt matter if you want to be second. You are. I will only be king if you are my second. Id put it more gently if I could. 
TRISTAN Then I am your second. 
MARKE Perhaps it is time that you took a wife! 
TRISTAN No! 
MARKE Cant live alone forever. 
TRISTAN I can! 
[Isolde passes] 
MARKE Isolde. I was trying to explain to Tristan the importance of loving. It seems he might live without it. 
ISOLDE Why? 
TRISTAN There are other things to live for. Duty. Honour. 
MELOT Yes well, peace can be just as treacherous as war and I feel that Marke doesnt really...Listen to me!!! Our attention must be on Cornwall now more than ever. 
TRISTAN I am sorry he didnt choose you. I am. 
[Melot approaches Marke] 
MELOT Can I speak to you? 
[Marke leaves Isoldes side, Tristan leaves and Isolde follows. They hide in a room were they begin to kiss each other passionately. Finishing his conversation with Melot, Marke seeks Isolde. Later that night, Marke makes love to Isolde] 
[Tristan and Isolde are out in a forest clearing together. It is an old ruins, with paintings of a couple on the broken walls] 
ISOLDE What do you think became of them? 
TRISTAN They were lives... just lived. 
ISOLDE I find myself imaging things in this place. I decorate it. Books, a harp there... a child. 
TRISTAN Would it be his or mine? 
ISOLDE I would have no way to tell, would I? He is a kind man Tristan, I cannot hate him. Yesterday at the market I saw a couple holding hands, and I realised we would never do that. Never anything like it. No picnics or unguarded smiles. No rings. Just stolen moments that leave too quickly. 
[In the marketplace Isolde and Marke shop. Tristan steals some herbs and makes a wreath for Isolde. He surreptitiously slips it onto Isoldes wrist as Merlot and Wictred look on] 
[Later, Marke goes to his bedroom but finds Bragnae waiting] 
MARKE Where is Isolde? 
BRAGNAE I dont know for sure, she was having a walk in the garden before and Im afraid I got tired so I returned. Its my fault. 
[Bragnae goes to find Tristan and Isolde who are meeting in secret] 
BRAGNAE Youre going to get caught! Both of you! Hes looking for you right now, hell see you! I told you this would happen! 
TRISTAN There is another door here, forgotten. This comes up in the bottom chamber of the keep. 
KING DONNCHADH When his throne falls apart, well go over and pick up the pieces. 
[Marke approaches Tristan as he looks over the town] 
MARKE Tristan? Can I speak with you? Is it possible... do you think a man blinded by love... Is it possible that that man might not see treachery right in front of him? 
[Takes out wreath] 
I found this hidden amoung Isolde's things. Do you think she has a lover? Has she said anything to you? 
TRISTAN No. 
MARKE Perhaps you could follow her. I cant ask anyone else. I know. I know what you think  Im acting like a child. Normally I can read faces, but with hers I feel like... I can't be objective. Shes so delicate. 
TRISTAN You really love her. 
MARKE Oh... I do...terribly. I didnt know how empty I was. She sustains me, she thrills me. And when I see this ring, it is a ring of thorns. 
TRISTAN The ring is nothing. She's loyal to you. I am sure of it. 
MARKE ... If you say so. 
[Tristan is tortured by Markes proclamation and burns his and Isoldes meeting place. Isolde finds it in ruins. The Irish arrive on ships for the coronation ceremony] 
MAN I count nine 
TRISTAN If they move they will warn us with a black flag 
[The King of Ireland arrives and shakes hands with a waiting Marke] 
MARKE You bring an entourage? 
KING DONNCHADH I can let myself be alone in my position Lord Marke. But dont worry, they will stay offshore.  I miss you. 
MARKE My nephew, Merlot of Cornwall 
[At the tunnel entrance] 
MELOT It comes up to the Roman foundations at the lowest level. 
WICTRED This is a godsend! 
[They both enter it and Wictred gestures for his men to follow] 
[There is much fighting as the forces of the Irish and traitorous barons besiege Castle Dor. In the tunnel, Wictred and Melot move towards the keep] 
WICTRED What will you say to him? 
MELOT That he will not make any more mistakes and that it is time for him to move ba  whats that?! 
[The two turn to see Wictreds men following them down the tunnel. Melot fights to stop them going down the tunnel but is stabbed] 
[The enemy forces break through the outer gates and are attempting to get into the keep] 
MAN Aim for the front of the line 
MARKE They are waiting. 
[As Wictred and his men enter the keep from the tunnel below, Tristan enters the tunnel from the forest entrance] 
MAN The Irish are inside! 
MARKE Follow me! 
WICTRED Bar the door make sure no one gets in! 
[In the tunnel, Tristan comes upon a wounded Melot] 
MELOT You. 
TRISTAN What happened here? 
MARKE Give me your shield, were pinned down! 
[Tristan attacks Wictred and his men] 
MARKE Tristan! 
MARKES MAN Him too? 
MARKE No, hes with us! 
[Marke and his men jump into battle, but not before Tristan is stabbed. Tristan manages to stop the drawbridge falling with his sword. He is again stabbed by Wictred] 
MARKE Tristan! 
[Tristan stabs Wictred and kills him. Tristan pulls the sword from his body as the battle subsides] 
MARKE Tristan! How did you get here? 
TRISTAN Secret. Secrets, in the bowls of the keep. 
MARKE In the bowls of the keep. 
MAN They have reached the palisades. 
GENERAL Then we must keep hope. 
[Tristan cuts the head off Wictreds body and slowly stands. Marke nods] 
[As the drawbridge of the keep is lowered, King Donnchadh makes his way to the front] 
KING DONNCHADH Get back! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! 
[Tristan slowly steps out with the head of Wictred in his hands] 
TRISTAN Behold! The head of a traitor!

CEDAR RAPIDS

DRAFT: June 12, 2009 
FADE IN ON: 
A SHODDILY PRODUCED TV COMMERCIAL 
The ad depicts videotaped scenes from Wisconsin's north country-- a farmer and a cow, a woman waterskiing, a guy mowing his lawn. A flat, nasally V.O. accompanies the images. 
ROGER LEMKE (V.O.) The Brown River Valley: It's where we work. It's where we play. It's where we live. But even here in paradise, accidents can happen. 
The ad wipes to an inappropriately gruesome photo of an obviously fatal car wreck. The NARRATOR is chroma-keyed over the image. He is ROGER LEMKE, 40, blandly charismatic, with a blonde moustache that evokes a low-rent Tom Selleck. 
ROGER LEMKE (CONT'D) At Northlands Insurance, our goal is to provide high quality insurance services and related products to businesses and individuals in Wisconsin's Northlands. I'm Roger Lemke. Not only do I care about you, we also endeavor to give you the coverage you need at the best prices around. It's that reason Northlands has been awarded the prestigious Two Diamond Award from the American Society of Mutual Insurers three years running. Because at Northlands Insurance, we insure your dreams. 
The car accident photo dissolves into a sunset. The treacly music crescendos and we: 
MATCH CUT TO: 
INT. NORTHLANDS INSURANCE - DAY 
The ad has been playing on a 13-inch TV in a small, wood- paneled office. A handful of EMPLOYEES and FAMILY MEMBERS applaud wildly. The proud owner of Northlands, BILL KROGSTAD, 60, embraces the man of the hour, Roger Lemke. 
BILL KROGSTAD Ho-lee Christmas, knocked her outta the park, Roger! Out of the G-D park, you sonofagun! Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
ROGER LEMKE Hell, I'm just a pretty face, Bill. That copy was all you. Do got one little gripe though, boss-- if you'd waited until after Cedar Rapids we could've said winner of the Two Diamonds four years running! 
BILL KROGSTAD ROGER LEMKE Aroo-aroo! Two Diamonds! Two Diamonds! 
The men roughhouse playfully. Roger's comely wife, GWEN, 30, holding their milk-fed TWIN TODDLERS, gives Roger a kiss. 
GWEN LEMKE So proud of you, Roggie. God, you rock. Doesn't your dad rock, boys?! 
ROGER LEMKE (an Elvis impersonation) Thank you. Thank you very much! 
More laughter and backslapping. After a bit, an as yet unseen MAN hesitantly approaches. He gently touches Roger's arm, not wanting to interrupt the revelry. Roger turns. 
ROGER LEMKE (CONT'D) Tim! Timmy Lippe! Didn't even know you were here. You see it, bud? 
TIM (earnest, deeply admiring) Oh, heck yeah. You were awesome. 
Despite appearances to the contrary, this is our hero: TIM LIPPE (pronounced Lippy), 34, wholesome and positive, though undercurrents of desperation lurk just behind his kind eyes. 
TIM (CONT'D) Just super... super awesome. Man. 
ROGER LEMKE Y'know what Tim, I want people to see the insurance game for what it really is-- it's a noble field. I believe that. Like I say, we're not just insuring vehicles and homes and that. Hell no. We're insuring people's dreams. 
TIM Oh. Yeah. I say that, too... sometimes. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
ROGER LEMKE Well shit, you do, don't you? By god, I stole your line! Knew I'd heard that somewhere! 
TIM Oh, no biggie... 
ROGER LEMKE Bummer they cut your little deal outta the ad, though. 
TIM Ach. Y'know. Got left on the ol'... 
A FEMALE CO-WORKER interrupts, accosts Roger and ignores Tim. 
FEMALE CO-WORKER Roger! Look out Brad Pitt! 
TIM The ol' cutting room floor, right? (upon being ignored) Brad Pitt. Ha. That's... (then, with forced nonchalance) Whoa. Cake. Cool. 
Tim goes to the cake table. He smiles at the cake, impressed. 
TIM (CONT'D) So awesome. 
The icing on the cake, a frosted visage of Roger Lemke, smiles back. 
INT./EXT. TIM'S CAR - DAY (LATE WINTER) 
A beige Buick Skylark splashes through a puddle of snow melt in the glum, isolated hamlet of Brown Valley, WI (pop: 337). 
Tim bops his head and sings along as a Parliament song plays on a Good Times, Great Oldies radio station. A dour OLD LADY shoveling her driveway stares as he passes by. 
BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D) Point is, I'm not exactly dancing in the streets here Tim, but it's a perception thing. You go down there to Cedar Rapids, wholesome and pie- eyed and all that. You show them that Northlands is a good outfit-- an upstanding Christian outfit... 
Tim considers the gravity of this moment. 
BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D) Aw cripes, say you'll do it. 
Krogstad starts crying again. He hugs Tim, his bloody hand staining Tim's canary yellow V-neck sweater. Tim looks up to see the Gambskys in the conference room staring at him. 
MONTAGE -- 
A melancholic yet uplifting song (Leonard Cohen's HALLELUJAH, perhaps) plays as: 
- Tim puts birdseed in his backyard feeder. He looks at the barren trees as he considers his fate. 
- Tim Googles "Cedar Rapids." He looks at photos, crime statistics, a Chamber of Commerce Youtube video. He closes his eyes, exhales. 
- Tim practices the presentation in front of a mirror. He works late. He types. He Power Points. Krogstad critiques. 
- Tim laminates maps of Cedar Rapids and area attractions. 
- Tim pulls a dusty American Tourister suitcase from the attic. It looks about 40 years old. He packs. 
INT./EXT. TIM'S BUICK SKYLARK - MORNING 
Tim looks pensive as he drives. He's wearing a new suit. It's a little too big. A greeting card and a Beanie Baby Rooster bounce along on the passenger's seat. 
Tim pulls up to a SPLIT-LEVEL HOUSE. A pick-up truck with the words Brodt Heating & Cooling is parked in the driveway. 
INT. MILLIE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Tim pokes his head into a living room, surprised to see Wade, the 60-ish bald guy from church, reclining on a Lazy Boy. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
Wade's boots are off. His socks are dirty. He's watching ESPN on a TV with an Olan-Mills portrait of Tim & Millie atop it. 
WADE Oh, hiya Tim. 
TIM Hey. Wade. Hey. Is Millie...? 
Millie enters in a terry cloth robe. A Yorkshire Terrier follows her. Millie acts nonchalant. So does the dog. 
MILLIE Hi Tim. (re. Wade's presence) Wade's cable's down. 
TIM It's six AM...? 
WADE Mike & Mike in the Morning. ESPN 2. 
TIM Oh yeah. Those guys. Hilarious. Ha. 
WADE Mm. 
TIM (finally, to Millie) Well I just wanted to... 
He displays the Beanie Baby and the card. She takes them with a cold smile. Tim notices an identical stuffed rooster on an oak bookshelf-- home to over 155 other Beanie Babies. 
TIM (CONT'D) Oh shoot. You already have a Strut the Rooster... 
MILLIE So this is it then? (TO WADE) Tim's jetting off to Cedar Rapids this morning, Wade. Big deal insurance convention. Iowa. 
WADE That right? 
TIM It's only four days. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
MILLIE Won't go to Germany for our honeymoon, but for work you can just gallivant around like Tom Petty or one of them? 
TIM (TO WADE) We agreed on the Dells... (then, to Millie) Should we maybe talk in the...? 
WADE Oh it don't bother me. 
Tim tries to proceed as if Wade weren't sitting there. 
TIM If I don't try to do this, it's not just my job, Mil. There are four other employees whose lives are on the line. Plus Carol, who does part time seasonal work. So. 
MILLIE It's not for certain a new owner would even keep you guys on. 
TIM No, Bill said he'd make that part of any deal... 
MILLIE Believe you me, Bill Krogstad is looking out for one guy. And that's Bill Krogstad. 
WADE (OVERTLY DISPARAGING) Krogstad. 
BILL KROGSTAD Said it before, I'll say it again: Your job, the office in Brown Valley-- all safe. What you need to worry about is getting down there and representing us the best you can. That's all you need to worry about. 
Tim swallows hard. Bill brings it in for a hug and inhales Tim's hair. 
INT. PLANE - DAY 
Tim has a window seat. He reads the safety card. He's sweaty, anxious. A vaguely swarthy MAN (Indian? Italian? Hard to tell.), 40s, sits next to him. A perky FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT You lucky ducks are obviously seated in an exit row. Score! (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT'D) Just gotta make sure you're willing and able to assist crew members in the event of an emergency evacuation... 
The man smiles nonchalantly. Tim tries to play it cool. 
TIM You're talking what, water landing? (looks around, whispers) Terror type deal? Terrorists...? 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT It's really just a formality. 
TIM Believe it or not, I have actually never been on an airplane before. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Oh, well you'll do awesome. 
TIM (takes a moment) OK. If you need any help, I'm in. 
The flight attendant smiles politely, if confusedly. 
THE PLANE TAKES OFF 
Tim looks out the window, watching nervously as the dairy farms and frozen lakes of northern Wisconsin recede. He instinctively turns to his neighbor. 
TIM Tim Lippe. 
MAN Ah. David Marinakis. 
They shake hands. 
TIM Great to meet you, Dave. Wondering, what kind of name is Marinakis? 
DAVID MARINAKIS Greek. It's Greek. 
TIM Marinakis. OK. Mine's German. Lippe. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
TIM (CONT'D) As in, "Don't you get lippy with me, mister." My grandma used to say that. Before she passed. Lot of people pronounce it lip. Course the high German's probably more like lipp-uh. 
David Marinakis nods, goes back to his book, seemingly shutting down the conversation. Tim settles in. 
THE PLANE LANDS -- 
Tim hesitates before stepping onto the jetway-- one small step for man-- and just like that, he's in IOWA! 
INT. CEDAR RAPIDS AIRPORT, BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAY 
Tim helps David Marinakis take his bag off the carousel. 
TIM Like I say, Dave, it's not life insurance so much as it is dream insurance. 
DAVID MARINAKIS It's a good way of looking at it. 
TIM I think so. 
Tim hands David his card, who takes it with a genuine smile. 
TIM (CONT'D) Let me know how things go with your Alltel deal, Dave. E-mail me. 
DAVID MARINAKIS Will do, Tim. Thanks. 
David exits. Tim stands there waving. 
EXT. CEDAR RAPIDS AIRPORT PARKING GARAGE - DAY 
Tim emerges from an elevator on the roof of a parking garage. He inhales the chilly Iowa air. He glances at his rental agreement and spots his car, a red Chevy Cobalt. 
TIM Hello. Score! 
As he approaches the car, he stops. He chuckles, in awe. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
TIM (CONT'D) Holy crap. Awesome. 
In the distance, the Cedar Rapids skyline looms-- its tallest building, the Alliant Tower stretching 21 stories into the cloudy sky. Tim snaps a photo with his cell phone. 
BLACK MAN Are you Tim? Tim Lippe? 
Tim just smiles a wide, deer-in-headlights smile. 
BLACK MAN (CONT'D) I'm Ronald Wilkes. Bill Krogstad said we were gonna be roommates? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
RONALD WILKES, 45, is conservative in dress and demeanor. 
MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) Tim! Tim! Tiiim! 
TIM (INTO PHONE) Let me call you back, Mil. 
Tim clicks off his phone, just stares at Ronald. 
RONALD You are Tim...? 
TIM Um. Yeah. Yes. You bet. For a minute there I was like, whoa, I'm gonna be robbed here, or... 
Tim laughs loudly. Ronald just looks at Tim. A beat. 
TIM (CONT'D) It's super... just super great to meet you, Ronald. 
Tim shakes Ronald's hand, holds onto it for at least two seconds too long. 
RONALD OK. You want to check out the room then? 
INT. JUNIOR SUITE - CONTINUOUS 
Ronald leads Tim into the room, a junior suite with two beds, a kitchenette and a couch in the separate living room area. 
TIM Check out these digs. Huzzah! 
RONALD Yeah, you could do a lot worse. (a serious beat) Look Tim, I gotta put the cards on the table here. The reason we got the junior suite upgrade is because the hotel overbooked-- wedding or some such. Point being, they were asking folks to take on a third roommate to consolidate space. Now to me, being an independent owner, the savings of adding a third guy sounded like a real positive. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
RONALD (CONT'D) But if you've got any qualms, I hear you L & C, that's Loud & Clear. 
Ronald has undoubtedly been called a nerd more than once. To Tim, however, he is the embodiment of cool and hilarity. 
TIM No. I'm down. Down with that. Heck yeah. Any idea who we're gonna be chilling with, roommate-wise? 
RONALD No. Just hope he doesn't snore. 
TIM (LAUGHS BOISTEROUSLY) Can you imagine? Or someone who has terrible gas?! Like, pull my finger. Brrump! Hello, no thanks! 
Tim is giddy like a kid away at camp for the first time. 
RONALD This isn't Woodstock, Tim. It's a regional insurance convention. Whoever it is, I'm sure he'll be a straight shooter. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
A pair of massive, scuffed wing-tips walk determinedly down the hall. We don't see the man they belong to, but we most definitely hear him as he passes various CONVENTION GOERS. 
MAN (O.S.) Hey Taco Bill, am I gonna see you at Horizons tonight? I hear they got their all-you-care-to-eat pussy buffet going! 
A booming laugh follows as the feet continue down the hall. 
INT. JUNIOR SUITE - CONTINUOUS 
Tim admires Ronald's laptop. The screen saver is a photo of a billboard advertising Ronald Wilkes Insurance. A picture of a stoic-looking Ronald is the centerpiece of the billboard along with the slogan, Your Insurance Professional. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
RONALD So far it's just the one billboard north of St. Cloud. Course the traffic load would get me more eyeballs in the Twin Cities corridor, but at the end of the day, it's N-T- S. Not Too Shabby. 
TIM Ha. N-T-S. That's hilarious. I'd love to own my own agency... 
The door bursts open. We boom up from the scuffed wing-tips to reveal DEAN ZIEGLER, 45, whose massive personality just barely hides an undercurrent of sadness and insecurity. 
DEAN Baroo-baroo, let's get this party started you mother-rubbers! 
Ronald deflates upon seeing Dean. He clearly knows him. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Ronald Wilkes! No fucking way! The Ronimal! Gimme some love-uh, my soul broth-uh! 
Dean gives Ronald a bear hug, lifts him off the ground. 
RONALD Turn down the volume, Ziegler. You just got here, for Pete's sake. 
Tim looks like someone deciding which direction to run from an oncoming tornado. Dean notices Tim's look. 
Orin places a 4 x 6 foot poster of Roger Lemke on an easel. A period of mournful reflection follows. Until Orin breaks out in song-- WERE YOU THERE?, a somber hymn. 
ORIN (CONT'D) Were you there when they crucified my Lord? Were you there when they crucified my Lord? 
Tim looks around nervously as the entire room joins in song. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOLIDAY INN HOLIDOME, HALLWAY - A SHORT WHILE LATER 
Tim paces, cell phone to his ear. 
TIM I need to talk to you, Mil. I'm in over my head here. I feel like I can't even swim. It was fun at first, but now it's like, I dunno. I need you so bad, babygirl... 
A man's voice picks up on the other end. 
WADE (O.S. ON PHONE) Millie's in the john. 
TIM Who's...? Wade? 
WADE (O.S. ON PHONE) You bet. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
TIM Are...? You're at Millie's still? 
WADE (O.S. ON PHONE) Badger hockey's on. My cable's out. (SILENCE) You want her to give you a ring when she's off the john? 
TIM Um. Yes, please. And just, would you tell her I love her very much. 
WADE (O.S.) You got it, bud. 
Tim shuts his eyes for a moment-- be strong. Be strong. 
INT. HOLIDOME FITNESS CENTER - A LITTLE WHILE LATER 
Tim, in shorts, tube socks and a very old Milwaukee Bucks tank top, reads the diagram for the chest press machine. He gives it a try, lifting about 50 pounds. The only other person in the room is a WOMAN, 37, on a treadmill. 
Tim glances her way, and by chance they make eye contact in the mirror. She smirks. He immediately looks at the floor. We stay on Tim, lifting weights, eyes to the ground. But we hear the treadmill stop. Finally, Tim looks up to find: 
WOMAN You were checking me out. 
Mortified, Tim drops the weights. They crash to their base. 
WOMAN (CONT'D) I'm gonna have to tell the hotel there's a pervo in the fitness center hitting on innocent women. 
TIM I... Ma'am, no. I'm sorry if you... I wouldn't... I have a fiancé! 
WOMAN Unbelievable. That poor woman should know what you're up to. 
TIM No, no, no, please. I didn't... 
The woman can't keep it in. She starts laughing. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
WOMAN I am so sorry. I'm totally messing with you. God, I'm a jerk. 
TIM Ha. OK. That was different. Ha. Yes. Yes you are. A real... jerkhead. 
WOMAN I'm so sorry. Joan Ostrowski-Fox. 
JOAN OSTROWSKI-FOX, middle-management sexy, if slightly too tan, puts out her hand. Tim shakes it. 
TIM Tim Lippe. 
JOAN Don't get lippy with me, mister. 
Whoa. Tim is taken aback by this. Joan notices Tim's outfit. 
JOAN (CONT'D) So do you play professional basketball, Tim? Because that's a pretty updated uniform there. 
TIM No I don't. I'm actually in town for the ASMI convention. 
JOAN Oh, is that where a bunch of guys sit around a table looking up the word "gullible" in a dictionary? 
TIM No, it's an association of insur... Oh. You're screwing with me again. 
JOAN Indeed I am. I'm here for ASMI, too. In from Oh-my-god, Nebraska. Just kidding-- Omaha. (wipes off some sweat) Ugh, I am gross, so I'm going to bid you farewell, Tim Lippe. See you at Horizons tonight? 
TIM Um. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
JOAN Unless you were planning on spying on me in the shower. 
DEAN (CONT'D) (re. the bartender) Kid was in the navy. Seaman. 
Dean nudges Tim and laughs as the BARTENDER, 25, approaches. 
BARTENDER What can I getcha? 
TIM Ah. Do you guys have root beer? 
DEAN You want a nipple with that? 
TIM Ah, why would I need a nipple...? 
DEAN Ach, I'm busting your balls. You don't get out much, do you buddy? (spots Tim's drink coupons) Whoa, who'd you have to blow to get all those? 
TIM I didn't... Nobody. President Helgesson gave them to me. 
DEAN Smug fuck. Trying to poison my roommate with his B-S propaganda. 
TIM I really don't... Orin, President Helgesson, he wanted to help me meet people. Just being friendly. 
DEAN (softens, fatherly) Wow-wow-wow, you are naïve. A rail cocktail's, what, four bucks? Times that by 10 drink coupons. We're talking 40 large, Tim. Doesn't sound so friendly anymore, does it? Sounds more like one of these I-scratch- your-back-you-scratch-mine deals. (off Tim's confused look) I bet ol' Orin invited you up to the Tiffany Suite, too, hmm? Fourth floor? View of the pool? Yup. (leans in, conspiratorial) Cocksucker's buying your vote, pal. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
Tim shudders. Dean gestures for Tim to act natural as Ronald enters with a taciturn Latino man, BILL HERNANDEZ. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Ronimal! Taco Bill! Over here! (TO TIM) Bill Hernandez. I call him Taco Bill. Mexican. 
LATER -- 
Lubricated INSURANCE WORKERS are now singing karaoke. Orin and Mike Pyle, the sweater vest guy, sit at a table in back. Orin looks at Tim with concern as Dean regales him. 
DEAN So Big Time Tim, what're you looking for pussy-wise here in Cedar CRAPids? 
TIM Ah, that would be nothing... 
Tim displays a photo of Millie (a portrait from the junior high where she teaches) in his wallet. 
DEAN That your mom? 
TIM No. No it is not. Millie and I are engaged. To be married. 
RONALD You're married yourself, Ziegler. The heck's your moral compass? 
DEAN My moral compass is pointing true north, if you read me. Right Taco Bill? 
Taco Bill sighs and wanders off to get a drink. 
DEAN (CONT'D) And by the way, Ronimal-- I was married. Was. 
RONALD Oh jeez. You and Patti split? Sorry to hear that. 
DEAN (barely covering the pain) Ah, she's a fucking asshole. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
DEAN (CONT'D) Together 17 years. Lucky if one of `em was decent. ASS. FUCKING. HOLE. 
It's a weird moment. Dean takes a drink, laughs it off. 
DEAN (CONT'D) What I was talking about anyway, Ronimal, is that from what I can deduce, young Timbo Lippe here has led a-- shall I say-- sheltered existence. And I think we oughta help him, y'know, aroo-aroo! 
Dean raises his drink heroically. No one else joins him. 
RONALD ASMI isn't a vacation for everybody, Dean. End of the day, Tim's here to work and to win. For his agency. 
TIM Exactly. And P-S, I would never, ever have "relations" or whatever with another woman. 
As fate-- that wily minx-- would have it... 
JOAN (O.S.) Hubba-hubba, check out these studs. 
It's Joan Ostrowski-Fox, the woman Tim met in the gym. Dean and Ronald get up, greet her warmly. Tim looks at his soda. 
RONALD Joan Ostrowski-Fox. 
DEAN The O-Fox! 
Joan does an ironic, flirtatious curtsy. 
JOAN Here she is, Miss America. 
RONALD You fly in from Omaha, Joan? 
MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) He says hey. 
TIM Oh. Tell him hey. 
MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) Tim says hey... 
A beat of silence. Tim looks irritated. 
MILLIE (O. S. ON PHONE) (CONT'D) I picked up that diet wet food for Brandy today. 
TIM I have to do some work before bed, so... 
MILLIE (O. S. ON PHONE) (TERSE) Well I should let you go. 
TIM No, it's-- I love you so bad, babygirl. It's so hard here. I just miss you. 
MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) I miss you, too, Tim. But this was your decision. You have to act like a big boy now. 
TIM Tss. Yeah, yeah. Keep reminding me. 
MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) You'll be fine. Just be careful. 
TIM OK. You, too. I love you. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
Tim hangs up, world-weary. 
INT. JUNIOR SUITE BATHROOM - A LITTLE WHILE LATER 
Tim sits on the toilet. His laptop sits on the counter, the Two Diamond presentation on the screen. He practices for the full-length mirror on back of the bathroom door. 
TIM Current risk mitigation mechanisms available to hog farm operations include futures and options to... 
The bathroom door opens. It's Deanzie. Tim shrieks. 
TIM (CONT'D) I'm in here! 
DEAN (WHISPERING) I know. This needs to be private. (WHIFFS) Whoa. Something didn't agree with you, did it? Second thought, meet me in the stairwell after you wrap things up in here. 
INT. STAIRWELL - A LITTLE WHILE LATER 
Deanzie sips from a mini-bar bottle of rum as Tim, now in a flannel bathrobe and slippers, enters the dingy stairwell. 
TIM What the heck is going on here? 
DEAN You sound like my fuckin' wife, Timbo. Jesus. Ex, I should say. EX. 
Dean sits heavily on the cement stairs. He hiccups, burps. Tim looks at Dean with a feeling that borders pity. 
TIM Are you drunk? 
DEAN Fuck yeah! (calms himself, whispers) Fuck yeah. But we didn't get to finish our little confab back at the bar. I figured some shit out. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
DEAN (CONT'D) Like I told you, no shocker-- Helgesson's buttering you up to get you in his camp, because he knows you and me are close... 
TIM We're not close... 
DEAN Close enough. You're voting for me for President, right? 
TIM No I'm not. 
DEAN Well anyway, there's a petition going around trying to take away your company's Two Diamond Awards. 
TIM I know. I heard. 
DEAN Well hear this: After you left the bar, Mike Pyle comes up to me-- Pyle of shit, I call him-- and he asks do I want to sign this thing. And I go, "Lemke might have been a class-A deviant, but the guy was tits as a rep..." 
TIM Pardon my French, Dean, but that's a bunch of bull roar. My boss, Bill Krogstad? He told me how you called up Joyce Armbrüster and smeared Roger's name all over town... 
DEAN Joyce who...? Oh, no-no-no, whoa- whoa-whoa, that old whore called ME. Harping about Lemke being a pervert and how she wants to take her business elsewhere. So I says, "OK, I'll run some numbers." Well, she calls back later that same day, says she got Krogstad to lower her premium. Which is all the greasy twat wanted in the first place. 
TIM So wait, you didn't call her? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
DEAN I may be a lot of things, but poacher ain't one of `em. 
Tim lets this sink in. Dean hiccups and burps again. 
TIM So what's with this petition? 
DEAN Personally? I think Mike Pyle of Shit started the thing as a way to drive down the price of your agency. Dollars to donuts he wants to swoop in and pick up Northlands at a bargain basement price. And you know what else I think? I think Orin's in on the deal somehow. 
BILL KROGSTAD Oh cripes, you know as well as I do that Polack's gonna head for the hills the second he gets his papers. But no, you want to end up in the poor house, Dione, we'll go. Let's just keep on cashing checks we don't have... 
DIONE KROGSTAD We are going to our daughter's wedding, Bill. 
INT. HOLIDOME LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 
Tim deflates, actually fighting back tears. 
TIM I didn't know I did anything wrong. 
BILL KROGSTAD (O.S. ON PHONE) Well you better try doing something right, Lippe. Because if you keep lousing up, we all by god starve! And don't you tell me to calm down Dione! 
Krogstad hangs up. Rattled, Tim hurries for the exit. He gets in the revolving door when he spots Joan Ostrowski-Fox outside having a cigarette. Rather than face her, Tim keeps going in the revolving door. But she sees him and waves. 
EXT. HOLIDOME - CONTINUOUS 
Tim does one more turn in the revolving door and steps out. 
JOAN I'm a very bad girl. But I swear I only smoke in Cedar Rapids. Care for a Virginia Slim, Lippe? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
Tim just shakes his head, unable to hide his despondence. 
JOAN (CONT'D) Whoa, what's wrong? 
TIM Mm, I don't know. Only everything. 
Joan gives him a kind, gentle smile. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CEDAR RAPIDS PARK - DAY (A LITTLE WHILE LATER) 
Tim and Joan swing on a swing set in a dreary little park overlooking the Cedar River. It is a cold, gray day. 
TIM He didn't have to yell at me. I didn't do anything wrong. I'm trying my hardest. 
JOAN D'you want me to kick his butt? 
TIM Could you? 
JOAN Absolutely. I know Krogstad. I could take him. `Sides, I'm a ninja. A nin- jette, actually. Hoo-waaaah! (TIM CHUCKLES) So Lippe, how'd you end up in the insurance game? God that sounded dorky-- insurance game. (does 40s-style Cagney) Look here, see, how'd you end up in the insurance game, see...? 
TIM You are freaky. (laughs, then) No, it's kind of weird how I got interested in insurance, actually. When I was six, my dad got killed in a sawmill accident. 
JOAN Oh my God. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
TIM Yeah. Not good. But after he died, our insurance agent fought like a tiger against the sawmill to make sure me and my mom were taken care of. And we were. (BEAT) The crazy thing-- our agent was actually Bill Krogstad. 
JOAN No way. Really? 
TIM He had just opened Northlands. Anyway, I remember thinking, this guy's a hero. A real hero. So even if he doesn't always treat me, like y'know... whatever now-- I'll never forget that. 
Tim jumps off the swing, taking care not to slip in the snow. Joan jumps off. They walk toward the river, silent for a bit. 
TIM (CONT'D) This river-- the Cedar River? It flooded the whole city a couple years ago. 
JOAN I remember that. Massive disaster. 
TIM People talk about the firemen and policemen and that. But think about all the claims in a disaster like that-- how hard those agents worked to make sure people's lives weren't left in the lurch. We're talking billions of dollars in damages, literally. And claim by claim, dream by dream, those agents helped rebuild this city. I'm telling you, it's a noble calling. I really believe that. 
JOAN You realize you just made it sound cool to be an insurance salesman? You are a hero, Lippe. 
TIM Tss. I wish. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
JOAN No, I can tell. You're the Superman type. Kind of dweeby on the surface but a real frickin' stud underneath. They'd call you Insurance Man-- put a big red "I" on your chest... 
TIM Well, even if you're being full of it, thanks for saying that anyway. 
JOAN Well, you're welcome. (THEN) So can you fly me back to the hotel, Insurance Man? I'm freezing my arse off. 
He laughs, sufficiently cheered up. She snaps her fingers and starts heading back. 
INT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY - DAY 
Dean and Orin argue. Ronald tries to stay out of it. 
DEAN I'm saying a Bridge to the 22nd Century is a stupid theme, Helgesson. Not a goddamn one of us is even going to be alive in the 22nd Century... 
ORIN Oh, and I suppose under a Dean Ziegler administration, we'd just abandon E-Commerce and all that, huh? What's your take, Ronald? 
INT. JUNIOR SUITE - A LITTLE WHILE LATER 
Tim sits on his cot. He is on his cell phone. 
TIM I just wanted to hear your voice. 
MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) Brandy, no! Bad girl! Sorry, she's giving me grief over this new wet food. What did you need now, Tim? 
TIM Nothing. Nothing really... 
MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) Well I for one feel like I ought to be on the fire department, I'm putting out so many fires. Lucy Kofnetka asked me to do altar guild for her. Again. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
TIM Oh. 
MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) Patti told me Lucy's seeing some guy who doesn't even go to church, so she apparently feels no need to maintain her responsibil... Brandy! No! She's going number two on the floor! No! You get outside! I'll call you later, Tim... 
He hangs up. He exhales. He looks out the window: An Applebee's. A Super Target. Traffic on the distant interstate. 
Something is bubbling in Tim-- maybe not cauldron of lava; more like a cup of soup left in the microwave a bit too long. But still, there's a boiling, churning glow behind his eyes. 
INT. NOTTINGHAM BANQUET ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Tim determinedly enters a banquet room where VENDORS have set up booths. He approaches a WOMAN at a table with a sign that says Met Life Scavenger Hunt! 
TIM I'd like to sign up for the scavenger hunt. 
WOMAN Super. Teaming with a co-worker or are you in need of a partner? (off Tim's look) This is a team event, like the Amazing Race. On TV? But instead of going around the world, you look for stuff in Cedar Rapids. And instead of a million dollars, the winning team gets a $75 gift card for Westdale, which is... 
TIM Eastern Iowa's largest two-story mall. I know. Sweet. (a thought, a moment) And yes, I do have a teammate. 
INT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY (OUTSIDE THE CONFERENCE ROOM) - DAY 
Ronald and Joan exit the Seminar. They spot Tim. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
RONALD Everything OK? 
JOAN Yeah, what was that call? 
TIM Oh, nothing. Say Joan, you have something on your blouse. 
Joan looks down at her blouse. Tim flicks her chin. 
TIM (CONT'D) Burn. 
JOAN (LAUGHS) You are very weird... 
TIM (bad Elvis impersonation) Thank you. Thank you very much. (AWKWARD) So, ah, I signed you up for the Scavenger Hunt. To be my teammate. In the Scavenger Hunt. 
JOAN Really? Why? 
TIM Uh, well I... Because Ronald already had a teammate... 
RONALD Bill Hernandez? 
JOAN Taco Bill. 
TIM ... And I thought you'd-- we'd-- be y'know, a decent team. So... (then, firm) I think you should do it. 
JOAN Heck yeah! I get to be Insurance Man's sidekick. We're going to kick some ASS! 
A few PEOPLE look curiously at Joan. Tim stands up a bit straighter. This is good. This is good. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
INT. SUNSET TERRACE BALLROOM - LATER THAT DAY 
Orin, in a theme-appropriate safari hat, addresses the 10 TEAMS. Among them: Tim & Joan, Ronald & Taco Bill, Mike Pyle & a FRIZZY-HAIRED WOMAN. Dean is absent. 
ORIN Like last year there'll be a few physical challenges... 
TIM (TO JOAN) I am super pumped! 
JOAN (WHISPERS) Whoo-hoo. 
ORIN Course this should be considered a fun event, in the spirit of team building. You can find your first clue "under the sea." By which I mean in the pool area. So ready, set, race! 
As the teams take off for the pool, Dean enters. Tim pauses long enough to say: 
TIM You're going down, a-hole. 
Just then, Dean's partner, a MAN in an electric wheelchair, PERRY KUHN, 29, rolls in. They high five and whoo-hoo. 
TIM Nice. Thanks. 
The waiter exits. Tim raises his glass for a toast. 
TIM (CONT'D) To victory. To new friends. To life. And all the joys of living it. 
JOAN That's really nice. Cheers. 
They clink glasses. Tim takes a dainty sip of his sherry. 
TIM Mm, it does taste a lot like communion wine. Awesome. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
LATER -- 
Joan feeds Tim a bite of her lasagna. A bit sticks to his chin. She wipes it off, semi-seductively. Tim laughs. 
JOAN So Lippe, I'm trying to figure you out. Hopes, dreams, aspirations, blah-blah-blah? Whaddaya got? 
TIM Mine? Let's see. Um. I would love-- some day-- to put a little greenhouse in my backyard. 
JOAN Dream the impossible dream... 
TIM No, I've actually seen some fairly decent portable ones at Fleet Farm that won't break the bank... 
JOAN C'mon, man. I mean fantasy-land stuff. What do you really want? 
A beat. He takes a sip of sherry, shrugs. 
TIM Well. I always hoped I could take over Northlands when Bill retired. But that obviously isn't going to happen now. 
JOAN Oh, screw him. He wants to sell, why don't you just buy Northlands? 
TIM Yeah right. 
JOAN Why not? You could get a loan. 
TIM I don't... Probably not. 
JOAN You know the business. You know the clients. You actually care about your job. You'd be perfect. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
TIM Grrrr. Ha. Time out. Sheesh. Let's. (BEAT) OK. What I'd really like is a family. To be a dad. So kids, I guess, that's what I really want. 
JOAN Yeah well, you can have mine. 
TIM You've got kids? 
Joan takes out her Blackberry. The screensaver is a family portrait: Joan, a MAN with a goatee, and TWO CUTE KIDS. All of them are dressed in denim. 
JOAN Tyler's ten. Ashley'll be eight next month. My little squirrels. 
TIM Awesome. Beautiful kids. And that's...? 
JOAN My hubby. Rich Fox. Richie. We met when we were both Rotary exchange students in high school. Lived in Norway for a semester. 
TIM Norway. 
JOAN I was such a spaz. Band geek, total ugly duckling-- braces, acne, the whole nine. I didn't even get boobs until college. Anyway, we ended up getting married sophomore year. Then kids. Then blah-blah-blah, and here we are. Richie's a Supervisor in the Parks Department now. For the County. 
TIM Wow. 
Tim doesn't hide his shock well. Joan sees it. 
JOAN I know it's effed up. And if I had it all to do over again, I don't know what I'd choose. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
JOAN (CONT'D) But I don't have that option. So this is my fantasy-land, Tim. Cedar Rapids. ASMI. This. I come here, and for a few days I'm someone else. No kids. No husband. No responsibility. Wild woman. (an ironic growl) Sometimes a gal just needs a vacation from who she really is-- know what I mean, Lippe? 
Tim nods but looks more confused than ever. 
INT. TIM'S RENTAL CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Tim drives. The Olive Garden doggie bag sits in Joan's lap. Silence, other than the radio. After a bit: 
TIM OK. I thought of another one. 
JOAN One what? 
TIM Wish. Or dream or whatever. It's still small potatoes compared to... 
JOAN No, let's hear it... 
TIM (titters as he figures it out) Dick head. Yeah Dean, you are a total Richard! 
DEAN Ha! I love it! Richard head! 
Tim high fives Ronald. Joan returns, sits next to Tim. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
RONALD To Tim-- the young rookie comes in, takes the scavenger hunt. That right there is P-T. Prime Time. 
They all drink to that. 
A BIT LATER -- 
Tim has finished his sherry. The bartender pours a second glass. Tim wears the shit-eating grin of a first-time drunk. 
DEAN Would you rather toss a bum's salad, y'know, eat out his butthole or... give your dad a B-J? 
RONALD Come on Ziegler, this is supposed to be a clean game... 
TIM No, if you used some salad dressing a bum's a-hole might not taste that bad. Thousand Island! 
Tim laughs hysterically. Which makes everyone else laugh. 
JOAN Shots! (to the bartender) Kamikazes, good sir. 
KARAOKE DJ (O.S.) OK. We're ready for Tim Lip to rock the mic. Is there a Tim Lip? 
TIM Did he just...? 
JOAN Why wait for the church choir when you can take care of one of your dreams right now, dude? 
TIM No, no, no, no, no... 
The bartender pours the shots. Joan whispers to Tim. 
JOAN I know you can do it, Lippe. Go be my hero-- Insurance Man. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
KARAOKE DJ Tim Lip? You in the house? 
Joan passes Tim the shot. He slams it. The room applauds as Tim nervously makes his way to the stage. 
Tim confers with the DJ. The DJ nods, cues up the song. Tim gives Joan a look of mock anger as he takes the mic. 
TIM I, um, I've met some really, just super neat people here. But this song, I'd like to dedicate to the first African-American person I've ever met. I mean, I've seen guys at the Oneida Mall in Rhinelander-- said hello and that. But... Anyway, I just think you're one of the most awesome guys around. Ronald Wilkes! 
Tim gives Ronald a thumbs-up. Ronald returns the gesture as the opening bars of Clarence Carter's PATCHES kick in. [NOTE: Patches is an EXTREMELY sentimental soul song about a poor black kid named Patches.] The first verse is spoken word. 
TIM (CONT'D) (reading off the screen) I was born and raised down in Alabama. On a farm way back up in the woods. I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches. Papa used to tease me about it. But deep down inside he was hurt, 'cause he'd done all he could. 
Joan and Dean whoo-hoo! 
TIM (CONT'D) (breaks into song, very soulful) My papa was a great old man. I can see him with a shovel in his hands. See education he never had; He did wonders when the times got bad. The little money from the crops he raised barely paid the bills we made. 
Joan and Dean rush to the dance floor. Ronald remains on his bar stool but bops his head politely. Tim tears it up. Patches continues, creating a: 
MUSIC BED OVER: Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
A SERIES OF SHOTS -- 
- Tim drinks more sherry. The gang laughs, having a blast. 
- Ronald tries to excuse himself. 
RONALD The presentation's in 36 hours. I can't afford to be off my game. Frankly, neither can you, Tim. 
Tim responds by giving Ronald a noogie. Everyone laughs. 
- Joan, Dean and Ronald roam the Holidome halls. Tim jumps out from behind a corner, whips some ice machine ice at Dean. Dean takes off running after Tim. Joan and Ronald follow. 
- The song fades out as the four of them approach the Pool Area. The sign on the pool door says, Hours 8 AM - 11 PM. 
RONALD (CONT'D) This is ridiculous, you guys. Told you, it closed an hour ago. 
Tim tries the door. It's open. Dean and Joan go in. Tim and Ronald stay in the hall. 
RONALD (CONT'D) Tim. Come on. This isn't you. 
TIM Uh-oh. Who is it then? 
RONALD You know what I mean. We've both worked our tails off. Why poop it away on... 
Joan, still topless, leads Tim by the hand as they sprint toward her room. They run past a SECURITY GUARD along the way. [Note: Tim still has a conspicuous erection.] 
INT. JOAN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
They burst into Joan's room, laughing to the point of tears. 
TIM Holy crap! We're so dead! 
Then Joan mauls Tim. She tackles him to her bed. He rolls on top of her. A primal, guttural howl erupts from Tim. Then: 
TIM (CONT'D) I want to make love! 
It's on. 
INT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY - NIGHT (A LITTLE WHILE LATER) 
Dean pounds on the door to the Junior Suite. 
DEAN Come on, Ronimal! My key got wet. Wake up, man! (NO RESPONSE) Ah, fuck it. 
Dean lumbers away, leaving puddles of water in his wake. 
INT. JOAN'S ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Post-sex. Tim lies in bed, beatific. Joan, now wearing glasses and conservative PJ's, comes out of the bathroom. 
TIM Your body's just so... firm and pretty. Mmm. Making love to you was just super... super awesome. 
Joan just smiles as she gets into bed. 
TIM (CONT'D) Wanna cuddle? 
JOAN Cuddle? Um. OK. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
TIM I love to cuddle. (NUZZLES) You're special, Joan. So special... 
Joan awkwardly pats Tim on the head as he drifts to sleep. 
FADE OUT: 
INT. JOAN'S ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING 
Joan is talking on the phone with her son. Her demeanor is entirely different-- a tone and physicality we've not seen. 
JOAN No baby, you guys are playing at Papillion/La Vista. Ralston is next week... (LISTENS) Calm down, Tyler. You're not gonna miss it. It's not that far. Put your dad on. 
Tim wakes up. The morning light hurts his hung over eyes. 
JOAN (CONT'D) Hey. Did you not look at the schedule on the fridge? Did we not have this conversation 10 minutes before I left? (listens, sighs) No, no, no. The playoffs are in Ralston. This is the last regular season game. He actually has a chance to play, Richie. Christ. 
Tim staggers out of bed, smiles. Joan holds up a finger. 
JOAN (CONT'D) Fine, but watch your speed on 84th by Giles Road. Chris Beeler's gotten busted twice right there. By that golf course. (LISTENS) Yeah, Tara Hills. Exactly. OK. Love you, too. Bye. Oh, tell Ty to kick some butt for me. `K. See ya. 
She hangs up. Tim does a theatrical stretch and yawn. 
TIM Good morning. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
JOAN Crisis on the home front. Sorry if I woke you up. 
TIM No problemo. 
Tim sees that Joan's computer is open-- and his Two Diamond presentation is up on the screen. 
TIM (CONT'D) Is that...? Were you looking at my Two Diamond presentation? 
JOAN Your cell phone kept ringing in your little fanny pack thing, so I shut it off. When I saw the discs, I figured I'd take a look. It's a solid presentation. 
TIM Um. Thanks. It was Roger Lemke's... 
JOAN Yeah, I see that. (WISTFUL BEAT) You know we were together right? 
TIM What? Whaddaya...? You and... You and Roger, you mean? 
JOAN It's so stupid-- but everyone basically treated us like the Brangelina of ASMI for a while there. It ended two years ago. He was getting into some pretty weird stuff... as we all know now. 
Tim is livid. He ejects his disc from Joan's computer. 
JOAN (CONT'D) Come on, Lippe. It doesn't matter. You knew, didn't you? 
DEAN (CONT'D) I can count on your vote tomorrow, right Ronimal? 
RONALD Not a snowball's chance in Hades. 
DEAN You're all a bunch of dicks. 
RONALD (spots Tim O.S.) Hey there, Hangover Harry. 18 hours and counting. Got your guns loaded for the Two Diamonds, partner? 
Tim's guilt is apparent in his awkward demeanor. 
TIM Um. I... I don't know about that. 
RONALD Don't be nervous. You'll do fine. There's a prayer circle tonight before the entertainment program-- might help ease your mind. 
TIM I'm sorry about... Ronald. Just... about everything... 
Tim abruptly walks away. Dean and Ronald look at each other, perplexed, as Tim exits the hotel into the pouring rain. 
EXT. CEDAR RAPIDS STREET - EVENING (MOMENTS LATER) 
A cold, hard rain falls as Tim walks from the Holidome toward an Applebee's across the busy street. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
INT. APPLEBEE'S - CONTINUOUS 
Tim enters and walks to the bar. He's soaking wet and looks despondent. A cheery female bartender, KAY, 40, greets him. 
KAY Happy Saturday! What'cha drinkin'? 
TIM A large cream sherry, please. 
As she pours a healthy glass of sherry: 
KAY Looks like you could use some cheering up. What do you call it when it rains chickens and ducks? (PAUSE) Fowl weather. 
TIM (DISTRACTED) That's pretty hilarious. 
Tim slams the sherry in one gulp-- to Kay's dismay. 
TIM (CONT'D) Another please. I have to use the little boy's room. 
Kay watches as Tim heads for the bathroom. He leaves his cell phone on the bar. 
INT. APPLEBEE'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Tim pees at the urinal. He zips up, goes to wash his hands. In the mirror, he's shocked to see: A squinty, drugged out MAN, 25, exit the stall, followed by... Bree. 
A moment of recognition. 
TIM Bree? (off her confused look) It's Tim Lippe. From the ASMI convention. We met out in front of the Holidome across the street? 
Bree coughs a hacking, phlegmy cough. She's very out of it. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
TIM (CONT'D) That's what you get from smoking all those-- what'd you call `em, heaters? Smoker's cough. Ha. Just kidding. Butterscotch? 
He removes a few hard candies from his pocket. She takes one. 
TIM (CONT'D) Small world, huh? 
BREE Totally. You wanna party? 
TIM Ooh, that's really awesome of you to ask. But I have a super important presentation in the morning unfortunately, so... 
The squinty-eyed man, GARY, who has been drinking out of the sink, looks up at Tim. 
GARY I gotta work in the morning, too. Can't be productive or whatever without occasionally taking a little ride on the good times express. It's like, fuck that shit, yo. 
TIM Yeah. I hear that. L & C. Loud and... clear. 
BREE Seriously. We're going to this thing at my Uncle Ken's later-- after his shift's done. 
Bree examines Tim, standing stiffly, hands in his pockets. 
BREE (CONT'D) You look like you're in serious need of some relaxation, dude. 
Bree nonchalantly pinches his nose. Tim looks oddly touched. 
TIM I have had a pretty messed up day actually. Might not hurt to forget about it for a little while. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
INT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY - NIGHT 
DEAN You two are a couple of serious fucking downers, man. Timbo left here in a huff a few hours ago-- you saw him Ronimal. Maybe he already knew. Shit, the kid's one of my best friends... 
RONALD You met him two days ago, Ziegler. 
DEAN Know what, blow me Ronald. It's not my fault you're too goddamn afraid to open up and tell another man you love him. Do what you want, but the Deanzie's gonna make sure his friend is doing OK. 
INT. UNCLE KEN'S PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT 
Boston's MORE THAN A FEELING blares on the radio of a pick-up truck. Tim politely rocks out, sandwiched between Bree and Gary in the front seat. A violent-looking, wire-thin man in an Applebee's uniform, UNCLE KEN, 40, drives. After a bit: 
TIM That must be pretty all right, Ken, getting half off at Applebee's all the time. I'd only weigh like 10- thousand pounds... 
UNCLE KEN Pass me that cube, Skeet. 
Gary opens the glove box, passes Ken a glass pipe. Ken lights up, takes a hit, passes it to Bree. Bree follows suit, then passes the pipe to Tim. Tim looks at it, pauses. 
TIM Ah...? This would be marijuana, I'm guessing? 
A beat. Then they all laugh like crazy. So Tim laughs, too. Bree puts the pipe in Tim's mouth. He looks frightened. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
BREE Suck the glass dick, dude. 
They laugh. Bree lights the pipe. Tim inhales and instantly: oh fuck, Oh Fuck, OH FUCK! Tim's eyes bulge, his teeth grind. Then he shakes his head like a wet dog and violently COUGHS. 
TIM Oh jeez, oh jeez, oh jeez. 
BREE A butterscotch might help. 
INT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY (OUTSIDE THE BALLROOM) - NIGHT 
Dean has his phone to his ear. Ronald and Joan watch. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S. ON PHONE) Hello. 
DEAN Trying to reach Tim Lippe. Who am I talking to? 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S. ON PHONE) This is Kay over at the Applebee's. Your friend left his phone here. 
DEAN That right? Is he there now? 
KAY (O.S. ON PHONE) No he's not. Be honest, I was kinda worried about the little guy... 
INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 
A series of shots as Tim-- sweaty, high and extremely hyper-- dances with Bree to the deafening death metal. The party is a volatile mix of BIKER TYPES and SPEED FREAKS. Even though his salmon-colored oxford shirt has come untucked from his casual slacks, Tim still looks a tad out of place. 
The following conversation is shouted because of the music. 
TIM I FEEL AMAZING! THIS IS AWESOME! 
BREE HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU HAVE ON YOU? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
TIM AH, CASH-WISE? ABOUT 90 DOLLARS, I THINK. I'VE GOT A TON OF TRAVELER'S CHECKS, THOUGH. WHY? 
BREE I'LL GET US SOME MORE CRYPTO. THEN YOU CAN FUCK ME IF YOU WANT. 
TIM (not sure he heard right) DO WHAT NOW? 
BREE JUST GIMME A HUNDRED. 
Tim pauses. Then-- what the heck. He unzips his money belt... 
INT. APPLEBEE'S - NIGHT 
Dean, Ronald and Joan look worried as they listen to Kay, the friendly Applebee's bartender. 
KAY Like I say, he was pretty ripped from all that sherry. He left with Ken and them for some party. 
DEAN Who's Ken? 
KAY (CONSPIRATORIAL) Ken's our cook. We all think he deals dope, though. I get along good with everyone. But Ken? He's just real different. 
RONALD Oh jeez. D'you know where they were going? Any idea? 
KAY You could try Ken's place. It's way out in the boonies... 
INT. FARMHOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Bree snorts a line in a disgusting, fetid bathroom. Tim sits on the counter. He's jacked up, sweaty and very chatty. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
INT./EXT. DEAN'S MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS 
Dean sits silently in the driver's seat. The quiet gets to him. He starts humming, then mumble-sings to himself and drums the steering wheel. 
DEAN Mm-mow-mow... Two tickets to paradise. Hmm-hmm, pack your bags we'll leave tonight... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Joan and Ronald make their way through the house, clocking the aggressively angry looks as they go. Joan sees something: 
JOAN Oh shit. 
IN THE KITCHEN: Uncle Ken is choking Tim. The PARTYGOERS cheer. Uncle Ken punches Tim in the stomach. Tim falls to the filthy linoleum. Bree protests. 
BREE But he paid for it, Uncle Ken... 
UNCLE KEN You can't let some dude pay for crystal meth and an ass fuck with a traveler's check, Bree. That shit can be traced. 
TIM (WHEEZING) It's fully insured. 100 percent. (THEN) And we didn't make love... 
UNCLE KEN Shut the fuck up. 
He kicks Tim hard. It's looking bad, when all of a sudden: 
RONALD (O.S.) Hey! HEY! 
They all turn to see Ronald. In the black trench coat, he actually looks BAD ASS. He has one hand in the coat pocket. 
RONALD (CONT'D) (hard-core gangsta speak) I may look like some suit wearin' businessman to y'all. Truth is, I'm straight up gangsta. And I always keeps one in the chamber... (indicates the bulge in his pocket) ... in case you ponderin'. So I suggest for the time being that you let my nigga be. Muthafucka. 
Uncle Ken blinks a few times. Then he lets Tim get up. 
RONALD (CONT'D) Indeed. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
Ronald takes Tim's arm. Joan joins them. The three of them walk backwards toward the door. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Dean is outside the minivan, taking a leak on a tree. He looks toward the house. 
DEAN Oh fuck! 
Ronald, Tim and Joan exit the house. 
RONALD Run! 
They run for Dean's minivan. Tim slips, sliding across the snow and mud. Ronald drags him halfway across the lawn before Tim finally gets to his feet. 
Dean, meanwhile, tries to finish peeing as he makes his way back to the van-- doing a sort of crab walk to avoid pissing on himself. Tim, Ronald and Joan dive into the minivan. Dean climbs back into the driver's seat. 
Bree and gang exit the house and watch as Dean peels out, tossing up bits of gravel as he speeds away. 
INT. DEAN'S MINIVAN - MOMENTS LATER 
Dean looks nervously in the rearview mirror-- all clear. Ronald tries to calm Tim down in the backseat. 
DEAN What the fuck happened? 
JOAN Oh my God, Tim. Are you OK? 
TIM (JITTERY) I don't know. I don't know. All I know is I was getting kicked and then Ronald was there talking like a ghetto person... 
Dean looks at Joan and Ronald-- What? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
RONALD In order to extricate Tim from what was clearly a volatile situation, I did, in fact, rely on my community theater training. I don't like to brag, but I do a pretty convincing Omar from the HBO program, The Wire. (beat, as a gangsta) Least them crackers back yonder seemed to buy it. 
DEAN The Ronimal! 
The minivan speeds through the dark, rainy night. 
INT. JUNIOR SUITE - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Tim sits on the couch bouncing his legs, still messed up. Joan sits with him. Dean and Ronald watch, worried. 
TIM I can't believe Bill would do this to me. He was like a father... 
DEAN Wasn't just Krogstad, Timbo. Orin's the real devil in this deal. 
Joan shoots Dean a look-- shut the fuck up. 
ORIN (terrified, through gag) Nmmmmmmmmm! 
TIM I did a ton of research on hog farm risk mitigation. Don't worry-- they might bite you a little if they think you're a food source. But there's never been a recorded hog- bite death. So... 
With great difficulty, Tim picks up Orin. Then, he awkwardly hurls him over the barbed wire fence. Orin lands on his back in a deep pile of mud and hog shit. The hogs descend. 
TIM (CONT'D) The Two Diamonds may be meaningless to you and Bill. But there are people who care about this stuff. Ronald Wilkes. Even Dean. Honest, good people. I'll come back for you after the Two Diamonds have been handed out to a legitimate winner. I'm really sorry about this, Orin, but the insurance industry deserves better than you. 
Tim goes to his car, leaving Orin wriggling with the hogs. 
INT. BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 
A HUSBAND and WIFE sleep. Their phone rings. They stir. The clock says 6:45 AM. The woman rolls over. 
WIFE Who the heck's calling at this hour on a Sunday morning? 
The man answers the phone. (NOTE: We should now recognize the couple as the clients Tim dealt with in the Northlands conference room.) 
HUSBAND Hello. 
TIM (O.S. ON PHONE) Kurt Gambsky, Tim Lippe-- your insurance agent. How's Pam and the girls? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
HUSBAND (whispers to wife) Tim Lippe. (TO TIM) Um, fine, Tim. We're fine. Everything OK by you? 
INT. TIM'S RENTAL CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Tim talks on his cell as he drives. 
TIM Well, I think everything's OK. Hope it is anyway. Listen Kurt, here's why I'm calling... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. SUNSET TERRACE BALLROOM - LATER THAT MORNING 
An eagle soars on a large video screen. A patriotic anthem plays. We boom down from the screen to find Ronald. He's on stage finishing up his Two Diamond presentation. 
RONALD People sometimes say that promises are cheap. You know what Ronald Wilkes says to that? N-S-F. Not so fast. At the end of the day, a man's word is a sacred creed. And the word I give you at Ronald Wilkes Insurance is-- I will work for you. Thank you. 
The words, "Ronald Wilkes Insurance: Working For You" appear on screen. Ronald's face dissolves over the eagle. 
The CROWD goes nuts, applauding wildly. Dean and Joan start a standing ovation. Ronald, though exhausted, beams on stage. 
Tim is nowhere to be found. An EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBER addresses the crowd. 
EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBER Once again folks, President Helgesson left a note under my door this morning saying he had to leave ASMI early due to a family emergency. I haven't been able to reach him on his mobile, but obviously our thoughts and prayers go out to Orin and his family. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBER (CONT'D) (a moment of silence) Now... we're set to hear our final Two Diamond presenter. Tim Lip from Northlands Insurance. Tim? 
Joan, Dean and Ronald exchange worried looks. Dean stands. 
DEAN Hey Travis, I don't think Tim... 
Just then, Tim appears. He is filthy-- covered in mud, sweat, hog shit and tears. He futilely smooths his hair and tries to tuck in his shirt as he takes the stage to sparse applause. 
Tim goes to the computer set up on stage for Power Point. He puts in his disc. His presentation appears on the screen. 
TIM (SEVERELY COUGHS) Thank you. I'm Tim Lippe. Hog farm risk mitigation... What is...? 
Tim knocks a folder off the podium. Papers fly everywhere. 
TIM (CONT'D) Smooth move, Ex-Lax. (a few chuckles) So, Hog... No. I, ah... this girl I met, sorry woman, I guess. She's 23. She takes drugs, and I think might be some kind of prostitute. (a collective gasp) But she's super insightful. Y'know what she said to me last night? Said the only real insurance is love. That's fricking INTENSE, isn't it...? 
Awkward murmurs. At this moment, a very pleased Bill Krogstad walks in with Mike Pyle. Krogstad tenses, however, when he sees Tim's state. 
TIM (CONT'D) I'm... ah... Our only true safety net. Love. Crazy. I believe in insurance. I believe in love... 
Tim laughs. He looks up and sees Bill. 
TIM (CONT'D) Bill! Bill Krogstad. My former boss, everybody. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
BILL KROGSTAD (JAW-CLENCHED SMILE) What're you doing, Lippe? 
TIM Why'd you do this, Bill? I don't understand. 
Krogstad chuckles, preferring to avoid any public drama. 
TIM (CONT'D) Why'd you do it, Bill? Why'd you do it? Why'd you lie, Bill? 
BILL KROGSTAD (to the audience) Sorry, folks. Guess it's against the law now for a business owner to sell his own business. Must've missed that constitutional amendment. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Want your get out of jail free card back? 
TIM Not particularly. 
DEAN When I saw it, at first I was like, shit am I supposed to take money out of the account, or what? 
TIM Did you? 
DEAN Nah, it was more fun watching the smug fuck sweat. I told him I'd rat his pathetic ass out if he didn't drop the charges against you. 
TIM (a genuine smile) Sweet. 
Dean tosses the paper into the trash. We now see what it says. On Holiday Inn stationary, in Tim's scrawl: www.paypal.com. Username: OrinHelgesson. Password: PontoonMan123. 
INT. DEAN'S MINIVAN - DAY 
Dean drives. Ronald rides shotgun. Tim and Joan are in back. The minivan cruises past downtown Cedar Rapids. Tim looks up at the buildings. So tall. 
Ronald considers his Two Diamond plaque. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
RONALD It's not as cool as I thought it'd be. I don't think this is even real wood. 
DEAN (lacking his usual energy) I'll show you some real wood. 
Ronald starts giggling. It turns into a laugh. The laugh becomes infectious. Before long, Tim, Joan, Ronald and Dean are all laughing their asses off. 
EXT. CEDAR RAPIDS AIRPORT - EVENING 
Dean, Ronald and Joan accompany Tim, now cleaned up, to the airport. Tim sets down his old American Tourister. 
TIM Well. 
JOAN Deep subject. D'aar. Get it? (punches his arm) I told you you were a hero, Lippe. Insurance Man saves the day! 
TIM Tss. Ruined it more like. 
JOAN True sign of a good day. 
DEAN Well, pal, it's been real. 
TIM (CHOKES UP) I'm gonna miss you guys. 
RONALD Yeah. You bet. 
DEAN Listen, my cousin Bob-- guy made a truckload selling these little scented pine trees all the ragheads hang in their cabs? Fuckin' believe that? Anyhow, he's got a sweet cottage up on Lake of the Woods. Canada? I can use it whenever I want. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
DEAN (CONT'D) I say we book it for June, before the mosquitoes go apeshit up there. 
RONALD More time in a tightly enclosed space with Ziegler. Gee, sign me up. 
TIM I think it sounds awesome. 
RONALD Actually, me too. The Ronimal could use a vacation. 
DEAN Done. 
Dean picks Tim up in a bear hug, spins him around. Ronald gives Tim a more subdued hug. Then there's Joan. 
JOAN So. Keep in touch. E-mail, all that good stuff. 
TIM You bet. You bet. You too. 
JOAN If you're ever-- not that you would be-- ever in Oh-my-God, Nebraska... 
TIM Yeah. Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. I used to watch that. Would be cool some day to see. 
JOAN Yeah. Look me up. 
TIM So. 
He puts out his hand. She laughs and hugs him instead. Tim closes his eyes. She feels so good. Smells so good. 
Joan's eyes are wide open. She swallows hard. She will not cry. It's OK. Keep telling yourself everything will be OK... 
DISSOLVE TO: Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
INT. PLANE - NIGHT 
Tim looks out the window, watching the city lights of Cedar Rapids fade away. He catches his reflection in the window. He exhales. He smiles a little.

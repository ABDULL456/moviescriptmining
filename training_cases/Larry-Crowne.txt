COX Let's call it. Today, end of shift, UniMart bids Crowne adieu. LARRY is dancing up a storm. 
EXT. UNIMART - PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON 
Less cars. Fewer shoppers. Heading into the night shift. 
INT. UNIMART - ELECTRONICS - LATER 
Larry is the only Team Leader still on duty and sober. He is fastidious in his work. The P.A. System blares. It's incomprehensible. He pays no attention. VASQUEZ -- a HUGE Security Guard -- comes by. 
VASQUEZ LC Why still here? 
LARRY CROWNE Team Leaders zone departments before punching out. It's policy. 
VASQUEZ I mean here here. You just got paged to Meeting Room 2. The P.A. blares again. Now they can hear it -- sort of. 
LARRY CROWNE Probably to clean up after the party. 
VASQUEZ Isn't it Employee of the Month Day? Larry brightens. That is what it must be. 
LARRY CROWNE Speck-tack-alar. Flushed at the prospect, Larry gives Terrorist Fist Bumps. 
VASQUEZ 
You're the only one around here who deserves it. How many will this be? 
LARRY CROWNE Ah, who's counting? He flashes his fingers: twenty two! 
INT. MEETING ROOM #2 - SAME 
Larry Cr wne soars into the room. Cubby is cleaning up the substantial mess. The Front Office Team has taken seats. 
LARRY CROWNE Remember how we saw "The UniMart Way" video, Vick? You and me, alone in this room, and look at us now. Hurley has a frozen face. Larry looks at Andrews' smile. 
STRANG Cubby. Make tracks. The Janitor literally drops everything and leaves 
LARRY CROWNE I think I know what this is about. 
STRANG I don't think you do. 
COX Crowne. At UniMart, we care. So we take care. Which makes moments like these tough for all of us. 
LARRY CROWNE Sounds like you're firing me. Larry is joking. 
STRANG I take it back. 
COX Corporate has mandated a restructuring in all UniMart stores. That's the word they use. I call it a pain in the touchas. 
(THEN) 
It is touchas, right? Where you get kicked? 
HURLEY Yeah. A yiddish word. 
ANDREWS Like the buttocks. 
HURLEY Touchas and buttocks. Synonymous. 
COX Hurts to get kicked back there, no matter what language you speak. Larry now gets it. 
LARRY CROWNE UniMart is firing me... 
STRANG Crowne-ie, you did a heck of a job. 
LARRY CROWNE Why me? 
ANDREWS Who do you suggest? Alvarez? Avery? I don't think so. 
LARRY CROWNE Why not Strang? Strang snorts. 
LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D) I've been here longer than you, Jack. I started 21 years ago as an Inventory Associate at the store on Euclid. Hurley takes over, as blank as a tax-form. 
HURLEY Seniority would preclude this reality, Larry, but UniMart's policy is to never limit your horizons. Larry Crowne has no idea what that means. 
COX 
Here's the prob: your lack of a graduate degree will forever retard any move up the management ladder. 
STRANG Becasue you never went to college you're forever retarded. 
LARRY CROWNE I won't make the Front Office? 
STRANG Never. (shows his college ring) S. M. U. Class of '86! Go 'Stangs! It's true. 
(THE PAPERS) This is some kick in the head. Not sure what to tell you, Mr. Crowne. 
LARRY CROWNE I m hoping not to lose my house. 
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD You're carrying what on the house? 
LARRY CROWNE 
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD Two Ninety-two K. That's trouble. Three years ago I'd have loaned you $700,000, but I think you read the papers. 
LARRY CROWNE 
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD No. She gets a brochure: "The RiverBank Survival Plan!" 
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD (CONT'D) But RiverBank does have a plan for you. 
(THE BROCHURE) In a few weeks your financial base will tell us what we can do. Find new employment. Liquidate everything low on the Value Index. Stick to a budget. Clip coupons, buy in bulk, you know the drill. Then come back and we'll work with you. 
LARRY CROWNE That's RiverBank's plan for me? 
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD It is Friday, Mr. Crowne... 
EXT. DERBY COURT - EVENING 
This is Larry Crowne's street. 
This is Larry Crowne's house. 
His car parks in the driveway and he steps out, taking a minute to survey what he may lose. KIDS play down the street under a streetlight... An ELDERLY NEIGHBOR is watering his lawn with a hose... A GUY is playing with his DOG... One house always has Christmas lights. Another has a handicapped ramp up to the front door.... 
EXT. LAMARR'S HOUSE - KITCHEN WINDOW - SAME 
Lamarr lives across the street from Larry, and is looking out the window as he prepares to light a scholarly looking pipe 
LAMARR Larry's home a little late tonight. His wife, PATIENCE, is sitting at the table, pouring over catalogs.. 
PATIENCE Maybe he was out on a date. 
LAMARR We'd see that on the news. He is about to light up with a match... 
PATIENCE Don't even think about lighting that up in my house. 
INT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - EVENING 
HIS UNIMART POLO SHIRT 
He is holding it in his hands. 
THE LAUNDRY ROOM 
Larry is about to throw the thing away, but then puts it and some fabric softener in his washer. 
LIVING ROOM - LATER 
Mood music plays from the Crowne Vinyl Library, a complete wall of LP's. Alphabetized... We can see into the... 
KITCHEN 
Larry sits in his breakfast nook with an old laptop computer 
and a pot of coffee. 
An on-line job application... Mega-Save. Larry is entering his data. He comes across that part of any application that will forever be daunting to him. 
EDUCATION/ COLLEGE 
What can he do, but enter the truth? 
NONE. 
More On-line Applications flash by.... 
Plug-It-In Center...Education/ College -- Didn't Go 
White Front House and Home ... Education/ College -- High School! Go, Navy! Furniture Planet ... Education/ College -- Is it necessary? 
Patterson's Appliances ... Education/ College -- Masters Degree: School of HARD KNOCKS!!! 
Larry stops. This may be futile. He looks about to give up. But then, he thinks. He stands. Thinks some more... 
IRONING BOARD Unfolds like a piece of high tech assault equipment. The iron breathes hot fumes... spray starch plumes like jet exhaust. Larry Crowne is ironing his nicest shirt and his best khakis to perfection. He is focused. Intense. And good at ironing... 
EXT. MEGA-SAVE - MORNING 
Larry is talking to CHEF AMOS, who runs the place. 
CHEF AMOS Oh, I remember you. Larry Crowne. I never forget anyone who quits on me. 
LARRY CROWNE As I recall, I gave my notice and worked all my shifts and that was 12 years ago. 
CHEF AMOS As I recall, I had to hire and train a line cook to take your place. Walking out doesn't happen in a vacuum, you know. 
(THEN) Doesn't mean I wouldn't give you a job again. But you've been out of the business a long time, and look around. I don't need you. The place is fully staffed and rocking. Larry will not be working here. 
EXT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
Larry's scooter is parked near the entrance. 
INT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - SAME 
Larry is seated at the counter. PERRY pours him coffee as RAUL -- the head cook -- is talking from the service window. CARLOS and NICK are in the back. 
RAUL You come in two weeks ago I would have kissed you on the mouth, but Carlos and Nick, they walked in. Best I can do? Put you at the top of the list. Raul goes back to work. 
PERRY Dang the timing, Kimosabe. Wish I could help you but Raul runs the back. 
LARRY CROWNE Not sure I could work here anyway. The atmosphere is too pleasant and the client√®le too A Number 1. 
PERRY Breakfast on the house. Chorizo Scramble, right? 
LARRY CROWNE No charity today. I got things to do. 
PERRY Like what? 
LARRY CROWNE Nothing. I was just saying that. 
EXT. DERBY COURT - MORNING 
The door open, the garage very tidy, as Larry moves old items out to the lawn. 
EXT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - SAME 
Some things are already set up from the living room. 
LARRY 
is raising money with a Yard Sale. 
EXT. LAMARR'S HOUSE - KITCHEN WINDOW - SAME 
Lamarr is about to pour himself some coffee when he sees a DISASTER looming across the street. He's out like a shot! 
EXT. LAMARR'S GARAGE - SAME 
Lamarr comes charging out the rising door and across the street. 
LAMARR There's been a yard sale at 1402 Derby Court since Monica Lewinsky! That gives me a monopoly on the location! You go yard on me, Larry Crowne and I will destroy you. He is now standing on Larry's lawn. Larry looks at him. Got fired yesterday. 
Lamarr sits on a for-sale chair. 
LAMARR Bloody Friday. Security sees you off, by the time Monday comes around the fired man is the forgotten man. Diabolical. 
LARRY CROWNE They said it's because I didn't go to college. 
LAMARR Smoke screen. The Man just wanted you gone. (his yard sale) You liquidating assets to raise cash? 
LARRY CROWNE Buying out Denise's half of the house was the worst advice, ever. 
LAMARR 
I told you to avoid divorce 
lawyers. Get married. Stay married. Come with me. They cross the street to Lamarr's house/yard sale. 
LAMARR (CONT'D) I'll tell you straight up - I'm not lending you money. 
EXT. LAMARR'S GARAGE - SAME 
This is a semi-professional operation. Boats, lamps, tools, chairs, computers -- some of it almost junk -- is for barter or sale. Inside his garage? Clothes and books - racks and shelves. 
Patience is organizing boxes of vinyl LP's. 
PATIENCE Whole box of Cha-Cha records from the Fifties. You don't have any of these, I promise. 
LAMARR He can't afford 'em Lost his job 
PATIENCE No! UniMart just lost my business forever! 
GPS VOICE Please Enter your destination. 
MERCEDES TAINOT I'm here. Shut up. Turn off! Stepping from her sub-compact, she struggles into a pair of heels, as in this state she drives barefoot. If only her huge Thermo-cup held a hair of the dog she might not walk such a crooked mile from the parking lot to the campus. Larry -- in his car -- screeches around a corner. He is frantically looking for a place to park, but as this is the first day of term, the lot is jammed! He nearly hits Mercedes Tainot. 
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) Jerk! 
LARRY CROWNE Sorry! Parking's impossible today! 
MERCEDES TAINOT 
Are you new to the Faculty? 
LARRY CROWNE New to the Student Body. 
MERCEDES TAINOT This is the Faculty Lot. We've earned degrees for these spaces. Students park on Mars. 
LARRY CROWNE I'm going to be late for my first day of school. 
MERCEDES TAINOT I bet it won't be the first time. 
EXT. E.C.C.C. - PORTABLE CLASSROOMS 
STUDENTS search for their new classrooms. Mercedes does too, among these 'portable' classrooms that have not moved in 7 years. 
INT. PORTABLE CLASSROOM - SPEECH 217 - LATER 
Mercedes stops at the doorway. 
MERCEDES TAINOT This is it? 
P.O.V. 
NINE STUDENTS sit self-consciously, including PINEDO, DIBIASI, MACK, and CALIMERIS Mercedes quickly does a head count. 
MERCEDES TAINOT(CONT'D) 
She laughs. 
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) My day has just been made and it's only 8:02 in the morning! 
(THEN) This class...is CANCELLED!! Mercedes explains. 
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) 
The city charter requires a minimum 
of ten students per class, otherwise it costs more to have us here than not. Did you really want a class at 8 AM? I didn't. Throw out those alarm clocks! Larry Crowne bursts through the door - panting for breath. 
LARRY CROWNE Please tell me this is Speech 217. Mercedes drops her bag on her desk. She is crushed and hates Larry Crowne. She takes up some chalk, turns to the board, then writes in large, shaky-yet-feminine script: 
CARE. 
She underlines it four times. 
MERCEDES TAINOT While earning a Masters in Shakespearean Political Discourse from Vassar, I learned to care. Caring is a prerequisite for this class I have to teach in this 
(THEN) 
(MORE) 
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) Participate. Show up on time. (Larry gets a eye on that) Care. And stay awake the 55 minutes three dawns a week I have to be here, or I will fail you and not care. (a name on the board) My name is Ms. Tainot. Not 'tie- knot'. Tay-no. You will each address the class on Wednesday. A procedure. How. To do. Something. Pinedo has panic in her eyes. Public speaking terr fies her. Dibiasi raises his hand. 
DIBIASI Ms. Tie-knot? Ms. Tainot glares at Dibiasi. Glares and glares at him. 
DIBIASI (CONT'D) Uh, Tay-knot...Tai-bo... 
MERCEDES TAINOT 
Who are you? 
DIBIASI Steve Dibiasi. Friends call me Nomad. Only two days before I gotta get up and give my address? You may be dreaming. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Why are you here, Steve? 
DIBIASI Counsellor Busik said this class would change my life. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Busik. Of course... Dibiasi's cell phone rings. 
DIBIASI I gotta take this... Mercedes Tainot may kill this kid. 
EXT. E.C.C.C. CAMPUS - SAME

PATIENCE Gonna be a long night with you two.

LAMARR Larry! The secret of any negotiation is for both of us to win Talk to me How much do you 
EXT. DERBY COURT - LATER 
Larry is carrying his Flat Screen TV, wires, box and all, from his house to Lamarr's garage. "Wing Ding Ding!" goes the scooter Lamarr has been working on with his tools. He lets it idle as he takes the TV. 
LAMARR Beautiful. I'll throw in a helmet. 
(SHOWING HIM) Gas. Brake. Light's busted. Tires are low. You'll need a special license. Larry straps on the old, beat up crash helmet (DOT approved). 
LARRY CROWNE All I need is the open road. Larry revs it, crashes into a hedge. 
LAMARR You break it, you bought it. 
LARRY CROWNE 
It still works. 
LAMARR Talking about the hedge. 
COMPUTER SCREEN Images of an EROTIC SUPER-HEROINE -- busty and hot -- and others, are being studied, and saved one after another. 
EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOME - DEN - EVENING 
DEAN TAINOT is a self-published author and blogger -- with a taste for this kind of stuff. Multiple copies of his own books line the shelves. When he hears the FRONT DOOR open -- he panics. 
DEAN TAINOT Well, hey! Who's home early! He keeps clicking away with the mouse until he's safe. Mercedes calls from the other room. 
MERCEDES TAINOT 
He covers his digital tracks and hops out of his desk. 
KITCHEN 
Mercedes is prepping the Margaritas for cocktail hour. 
DEAN TAINOT First day of term calls for a celebration! 
MERCEDES TAINOT You'd think so. 
DEAN TAINOT What's your burden this go round? 
MERCEDES TAINOT Tap Dancing. Ping Pong. Water Torture. And Speech at Sunrise 
DEAN TAINOT I built a Flamethrower of a posting for WarriorWeb which, if I do say, will feed nicely as an outline for 
As the blender BLARES, husband and wife eye each other. She's looking at him. He's smiling like a guilty idiot. 
"Carrier: Second Angel." And, I 
was a guest blogger on CyberShare. 
Blender off. She starts pouring. 
DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D) Y u don't believe me. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Why wouldn't I believe you? 
Got me here for a nickel's worth of 
gas. 
TALIA You're in Matsutani's Econ with me. 
LARRY CROWNE I am? 
TALIA That class is straining my coconut. 
LARRY CROWNE It's only been one day 
TALIA Didn't know you scooted. 
LARRY CROWNE New to the sport. 
TALIA (pulls out mobile phone) Give me your number. I'll introduce you to like-minded enthusiasts. 
(THEN) Name please? 
LARRY CROWNE Larry Crowne. With an 'e'. 
TALIA 'Larry'? I don't think so. I used to be Kathleen but one day I looked in the mirror and saw a girl named Talia. (then in her phone) Putting you in as 'Lance'. Check your texts and we'll do us some scooting. 
(THEN) Gotta tell you, Lance. Tucking a polo shirt into khakis makes you look like a cop. 
LARRY CROWNE Not much fashion sense. 
TALIA I know! Gotta change that... Larry sees Mercedes Tainot walking from the Faculty lot, and doesn't want to be late again. 
LARRY CROWNE 
Gotta go! 
TALIA Then get going!! Talia watches him go. Likes him thus far... 
INT. SPEECH 217 - LATER 
Mercedes is at a desk in the back. Bored and, yes, a bit hungover again. You can tell by the way she takes long pulls from her Thermo-cup. Busik is sitting in on the class, not far from Mercedes. 
In front of the board that says "PHONES OFF!!" Calimeris is demonstrating an exercise for her speech. 
CALIMERIS With the push-up added, the 4-count Burpie becomes the 6-count Burpie and works out the pecs and biceps. It's an all-in-one exercise perfect for Cheerleader conditioning. The 
6-COUNT BURPIE 
The class is too shy to applaud though Busik claps like a fan. 
MERCEDES TAINOT We now all know how to Burpie. Thank you. 
(THEN) Who's next? No one volunteers. Though Pinedo is about to... 
MERCEDES TAINOT(CONT'D) Make me the bad guy. 
(HER ROSTER) Ms. Crowne? 
LARRY CROWNE You mean me? 
MERCEDES TAINOT Mr. Crowne. My bad. Larry goes to the podium - armed with a huge stack of 3x5's. 
Busik shoots him a 'thumbs up.' 
He looks at Mercedes for the starting cue. 
MERCEDES TAINOT(CONT'D) Go. 
LARRY CROWNE My presentation will be on the subject of a very particular procedure. "How to make French Toast", but I'll speak English... Larry has used up one card. Mercedes rolls her eyes and talks to herself in a MOVIE DEVICE way... 
MERCEDES TAINOT M classes were once filled with e rnest young men ready to learn all I had to teach them. Cute boys fresh out of High School who all had crushes on me from day one. Now look at my cadre. Dibiasi. Bound for jail. Mack. Treating college like another tour of combat. Crowne. If this was Hamlet, he'd be Osric in Act 5. The part that is always cut. 
Larry checks on Ms. Tainot in the back. She is not talking, only listening (the MOVIE DEVICE mentioned above)... 
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) Busik, I am going to kill you. You can't suggest these saps take Shorthand or Oral Hygiene? Bring me in at this ungodly hour for 2 minutes on French toast? Busik looks at Mercedes, signals a 'not bad, eh?' about Larry. She is a stone face. 
LARRY CROWNE Most people think syrup comes out of a plastic bottle. 
MERCEDES TAINOT (still talking to herself) Great. The history of the sugar maple tree now. Thank you Wikipedia. Larry still has a dozen cards to go. 
But the speech is over. MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) 
Ah-ooo-gah! Time's up. 
LARRY CROWNE That went fast... 
STAN We hit those last week. 
TALIA If it was Saturday we'd look for yard sales. 
LARRY CROWNE I know where a yard sale is, like everyday. 
TALIA Lead the way.

DELL GORDO Take point! 
LARRY CROWNE Follow me, boys and girl! 
EXT. DERBY COURT - LATER

LAMARR We're being invaded! One by one, the Scooters park and survey the scene. The stuff that Larry was selling is now part of Lamarr's operation, being sold 'On Consignment'. . 
LAMARR (CONT'D) Larry, what kind of thugs you get in with? 
LARRY CROWNE College buddies. 
LAMARR 
If they're college buddies why aren't they in college? 
TALIA You have any old clothes? 
LAMARR Speak to my bride inside. Dell Gordo, Stan and the others are going through hardware, tools, appliances. 
DELL GORDO Oh man! These TV trays are too much! 
LAMARR Bargains at $100 apiece. 
DELL GORDO For these? Are you nuts? 
LAMARR I'm joking, kid. Let's get to haggling. 
DELL GORDO I get it. 
(THEN) A buck apiece. 
LAMARR 
YOU Ninety-nine dollars apiece. see how this is working? 
DELL GORDO Two bucks apiece! 
LAMARR Ninety-eight and, kid, I do this every day.

LARRY CROWNE What is all this worth? Out she ome with an assortment of men's clothes. 
TALIA A lot to me. Try these on. 
LARRY CROWNE Where? 
TALIA Anywhere. Fashion is no place for modesty. Strip. He does. 
LARRY CROWNE 
TALIA This is a service to humankind, Lance. It hurts me to see a Top Cat dressed like an ex-hockey player. You gotta look gorgeous from shoe to collar. Starting now. Larry is taking off his pants just as Dell Gordo has pulled up on his scooter. 
DELL GORDO Monkey! Thought you might be here. 
TALIA Lance! My boyfriend's here! Put your pants on! Larry, in fact, has his pants off. 
Dell Gordo has a look in his eyes of, well, "What the fuck?"

Mercedes comes in through the door. Sees what's up. being good and cute. He pours Margaritas. 
DEAN TAINOT No argument here, Mercy. Fact: I'm a dope. Fact: My wife is beautiful and brilliant. And I will be a good boy from now on. Why? Because you're right and I've learned my lesson. Just don't be mad at me forever. I have a pliable soul and I pray you do too 
He dangles her a fresh Margarita. She'll take it... 
BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Mercedes and Dean have had make up sex. It was okay. 
DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D) Ah. That was nice. 
MERCEDES TAINOT It was. Yes. 
DEAN TAINOT Been thinking. If you ever want to take a whack at writing something -- say a blog a couple of times a week -- I could help you out. 
MERCEDES TAINOT How? 
DEAN TAINOT I'd read your stuff. Make comments to make it web-savvy. Pieces need 
to pop, you know. Takes a little 
PRACTICE 
MERCEDES TAINOT Okay. 
DEAN TAINOT See? You can't stay mad at me. No reason to be mad at me... He smooches her. Mercedes smooches back.

LARRY CROWNE Denise. Larry. 
DENISE My god. Larry Crowne. I remember you. 
LARRY CROWNE This a good time? 
DENISE Other than me being at work? 
LARRY CROWNE I'll call you later.

RAUL So don't. 
LARRY CROWNE I gotta get to class before I miss the whole day. And I can't work mornings Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays. 
RAUL Soon as the rush is finished, go. I'll get my idiot brother-in-law three days a week. You take evenings. Deal?

MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) Where's Larry Crowne?! Everyone looks at her. 
MACK Guess Larry's out today. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Anyone know why? 
MACK He didn't call me. Ad-libs: no one knows why Larry is out. 
MERCEDES TAINOT I don't believe this! Ditching me? He ditched me? Not okay. Larry Crowne, you are on my Shit List. Everyone shares looks like they've witnessed a Lover's Spat. Speaking quietly in their seats... 
DIBIASI Sounds like Teacher has a thing for a Teach-ee. 
CALIMERIS 
When you were out last week, she said nothing. I think she has a crush on Larry Crowne. 
PINEDO I do too. (off their looks) He's a nice man. Mack speaks up. 
MACK Should I continue?

DR. MATSUTANI This is college, Mr. Crowne. The only thing you can't do is smoke in the building. Hand over your phone. 
(LARRY DOES) I'm going to ask a question in a moment. I want someone other than you to answer it - I don't care if the silence is positively Arctic. Larry moves to take a seat. 
Talia can't believe his choice of dress. She mimes to him "What's with the outfit?" His mime answer is unintelligible. 
DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D) 
Larry pulls in. 
INT. RIVERBANK BRANCH - LATER

LARRY CROWNE I got a job. 
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD Atta Baby! 
LARRY CROWNE Perry's Coffee shop. Breakfast all day. And I'm going to school. 
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD At East City. I see. (from the papers) Larry, this doesn't change anything. 
LARRY CROWNE I was afraid of that. 
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD The interest alone will eat up your service industry salary. 
LARRY CROWNE 
You said come back in a few weeks. 
It's been a few weeks. 
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD Okay. 
(THEN) I will personally take this to my supervisor and fight to get you the loan you need. But you know how complimentary coffee is always lousy? Your chances are, too. 
LARRY CROWNE I can't make the payments on the house. I'm going to lose it, aren't I? 
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD Stop with the gloomy puss. You're doing everything right. Hang in there. You still have a friend at RiverBank.

EXT. SQUARE HOLE NO. 114 - MORNING 
RAIN! Coming down in buckets. Talia has the grate up, wrapping a new outfit for Larry culled from her supply. Dell Gordo is in a rain slicker. 
DELL GORDO I think it's letting up. 
TALIA It's going to storm till next year. 
DELL GORDO We can't stay here all day. Find a raincoat and let's get a little wet. 
TALIA I do not scoot in the rain. 
DELL GORDO 
How you going to get to school then, College Co-Ed Belle? Larry pulls up in his Karmann Ghia -- top up. 
TALIA My savior! Look at your new schmatas. 
(HOLDING BOOTS) And footwear! (hopping in, to Dell) Stay dry, sweetie! Dell Gordo is not happy to see this. 
EXT. DONUT SHOP - MORNING - RAIN 
It is raining. Mercedes' car is out front. 
MERCEDES TAINOT (PRE-LAP) I got engaged to a teacher/writer with two books in print... 
INT. MERCEDES' CAR - MORNING - RAIN 
The windows are fogging up. Frances and Mercedes sip take- out coffee and eat glazed rings of death. 
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH I never read them. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Who did? I'm married to an ex- teacher turned blogger with two books in print. And oh, yes, he has the libido and internet access of a 13-year-old. 
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH I had a boyfriend who owned every movie Sophia Loren ever made. I d hear a DVD go into the playe an knew what I was going to be doing in a half-hour. Right next to them, Larry Crowne pulls up in his Karmann Ghia with the top up and Talia in the passenger seat. 
MERCEDES TAINOT 
EXT. PERFECT SPACE - DAY 
An empty store right next to the Tattoo Parlor. Talia is looking through the window 
A hand-drawn sign with an arrow says "FOR LEASE ENQUIRE NEXT 
DOOR ASK FOR MAURICE." Talia smiles. Her mobile rings its unique ringtone. 
STAN: "Scoot! Webster and Palm!" 
INT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON 
Larry is slapping orders together at the same time he h s his studies out -- trying to do two jobs at the same tim His mobile phone vibrates. TALIA: "Scoot?" 
He punches in 
"Can't. Job." 
He goes back to his studies just as another order comes up. Then his phone vibrates again. TALIA: "Job? Sob! Coming!" 
LARRY CROWNE 
Oh crap. 
EXT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - LATER 
Talia and the scooter gang pull in. 
INT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - SAME 
In they pour, sizing up the place for a hangout. Talia, Stan - - minus Dell Gordo -- and others sit at the counter where they can see Larry. 
TALIA Chef Corona! Steam us some corn bread? The others pretend to be grumpy diners: Feed us! What's a Reuben Sandwich? Where's my Sanka! 
LATER 
Up comes order after order. Burgers. Hot beef sandwiches. Turkey clubs. Greek Salads. 
TALIA (CONT'D) Woman on deck! Raul looks up from his Spanish Language Newspaper. 
RAUL You can't come in here. 
TALIA I'm a friend of Lance's. 
RAUL No Lance works for me. Talia hops up to sit on a butcher block. 
RAUL (CONT'D) This is my kitchen and I am the boss. 
TALIA Is he, Lance? 
LARRY CROWNE 
Raul's my boss, yeah. 
TALIA Rah-ool. Rhymes with ya-cool. Are ya' cool, Raul? 
RAUL Sure I'm cool. Tough but fair, too. 
TALIA As boss, do you make up the menu? 
L 
RAUL 
A N . But I do the purchasing. 
R 
TALIA Is that a tough but fair job? 
R 
RAUL 
Y It makes me crazy, you kidding? But it's gotta be done every day or guess what? No food. I'll show you how much I gotta do... 
P 
U And just like that, Talia has seduced another man. telling her the secrets of purchasing orders s fries into the deep fryer. 
RAUL IS 
LATER Talia is with Perry at the register. She's seduced him now, as he goes over the menu and what sells more than ever. 
JANET As soon as I saw you, I said, "I want to go out with that man." 
TONY What did you say when I asked you out? 
JANET I said "Yes." You were there, remember? 
TONY I saw you and I thought "I would be a lucky guy if she'd go out with me." 
JANET Yes you are. 
TONY Honestly, this is about as good a first date goes, isn't it? 
JANET 
Disaster looms on most first dates, but I'm talking to you like you're a friend I want to make out with. 
TONY Hold that thought. Dean and Mercy pull up beside them in their car. 
Mercedes is out of the car before it even stops. 
DEAN TAINOT I take it back. I take it back. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Drive, asshole! Drive away! 
DEAN TAINOT I've been drinking, too. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Drive straight til you hit a cliff on the coastline! 
DEAN TAINOT You win! I'm letting you win! Everything you say is right and 
WIN! 
MERCEDES TAINOT LOSER! I MARRIED A LOSER!!! With a tiny dick! Tiny dick LOSER! 
DEAN TAINOT Screw you, you washboard! 
MERCEDES TAINOT Oh, chillax!!! 
GPS VOICE Please enter your destination. Dean screeches off into the night. Mercedes picks up a rock and hurls it at him. 
MERCEDES TAINOT I'm throwing rocks at my own car !! Janet and Tony are aghast - silent - in shock. 
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) The jerk who just deserted me? My husband of 4 friggin' years! She stomps off into the night. Janet and Tony don't know what to do with each other now. 
EXT. BUSINESS STREET - LATER 
Mercedes is walking home. It's a bit longer than she would like. She comes to a bus stop and studies the route. She sits and removes her shoes. 
MERCEDES TAINOT I loved these shoes once. Stupid shoes. She sits at he stop, about to cry. Then she sort of does cry, for so any reasons. In the distance, we hear... 
The ROAR of SCOOTERS. Then here they come. A night-time 'Scoot'. All the REGULARS go by. Somewhere in the mix are Larry and Talia. Talia is just able to turn her head and see Ms. Tainot at the bus stop. She slows. 
TALIA Lance! Chick alert! Larry is beside her. They stop. 
TALIA (CONT'D) You are not going to believe how Fate meets cute! She u-turns and Larry follows her, confused. 
BUS BENCH 
Mercedes wonders who these Mock Wild Ones are that pull up to her. 
LARRY CROWNE Ms. Tainot? 
MERCEDES TAINOT No. He takes off his helmet. 
LARRY CROWNE 
Larry Crowne. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Jesus Christ. 
TALIA And I've been calling you 'Lance'. 
LARRY CROWNE Do you need a ride? Hop on. 
MERCEDES TAINOT And bust up your romp in the glen with Bambi? 
TALIA Hey. Bambi was a boy. 
LARRY CROWNE I was heading home. 
(TO TALIA) Right? We're done scooting? 
TALIA Not me. I love riding in the night. Magic happens. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Best night I've had in years! Drive on, McDuff! 
EXT. CEDAR HILLS TOWNHOMES - NIGHT 
In through the gates come our night crawlers. Mercedes is 
EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - SAME 
Larry shuts off the motor. Mercedes is half asleep. She doesn't remember to take off Larry's helmet. 
LARRY CROWNE Unit 114. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Thanks for the ox-cart ride. Like a sleepwalker. Stands at the Alarm Pad. 
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) I can see the Alarm Pad. I know the code. But my hands aren't working. 
(THEN) Help me. 
LARRY CROWNE You don't want to give me your pass code. 
MERCEDES TAINOT 
Just hold my hand up to the numbers. I'll manage from there. Larry takes her hand and guides it to the pad. 
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) Look away now. 
(HE DOES) Two two two two. Pound. Larry heard every word. 
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) W ere's my purse? Oh yeah. My car. The key please? It's buried in that plant. Larry digs out an Altoids tin. Rattles it. 
LARRY CROWNE This it? 
MERCEDES TAINOT Why I think it is! 
LARRY CROWNE I'll get the door for you Larry opens the door, reaches in, turns on the light. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Take one step inside and I call security. Larry steps away from the door. 
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) And forget this ever happened. 
LARRY CROWNE What? 
MERCEDES TAINOT This whole sorry chapter tonight. 
LARRY CROWNE What? 
MERCEDES TAINOT You passing up Gidget for a flat old coot like me. 
LARRY CROWNE What are you talking about? 
MERCEDES TAINOT 
What, you have no short-term memory? Larry has been tying to be polite. 
LARRY CROWNE When I say 'what', it means I get it and have already purposefully forgotten everything. Call it irony. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Sarcasm. Irony is when Gallant lands in the drunk tank while Goofus scoots me home. 
LARRY CROWNE Goodnight, Ms. Tainot. She doesn't move, but flashes her ring finger. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Mrs. I'm Mrs. Tainot. Can you not see that? 
LARRY CROWNE I assumed you preferred Ms 
MERCEDES TAINOT When we presume we make a pretty pair of asses of me and you or something like that. 
(THEN) Why aren't you married? 
LARRY CROWNE That's a long story and it's late. 
(THEN) My helmet? 
MERCEDES TAINOT Help yourself. She sticks her neck out. If this were a movie, they might kiss right now. Larry pauses. Mercedes looks at him. He's not a bad looking guy. He starts to undo the helmet strap. 
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) I noticed something on the ride. 
LARRY CROWNE 
WHAT 
MERCEDES TAINOT 
IT MAY You smell good. 
Amid the others... 
TALIA 
Oh, come on! I left you all set up! What went down? 
LARRY CROWNE Epilog. School today. 
TALIA Lance! A Betty on your Scooter after midnight? Holding on, her arms around you, pressed against your back, is a license to at least cop a feel. 
LARRY CROWNE If we had ended up making out, you still wouldn't hear it. Talia slugs him. All in play... 
MERCY 
Convinced Larry is gossiping about last night, Mercy backs away from the scene, and slinks away toward her class. 
INT. SPEECH 217 - DAY 
Mercedes is in the back, wearing the darkest glasses allowed a teacher in a classroom, hiding the fact that Mercy is looking at Larry. Larry is listening to Lala with delight. 
PINEDO Seeing them -- the Northern Lights, the Aurora Borealis -- should have been beyond me, but I was a little girl in Coach class still awake, a window seat, a moonless night somewhere over Greenland with a shimmering curtain of emerald, gossamer light dancing just for me. 
(THEN) That is something I will remember forever. The SPEECH is over. The class erupts in applause for Lala, who has hit a home-run. Foremost of the fans, Larry, who rises in applause for the once quiet classmate. Then the applause is over. 
The teacher says nothing. DIBIASI 
That was a knockout speech, Lala. Made the news. Caused riots downtown. School's out til 2019. The students look at each other, shrug their shoulders, and head ou . 
MERCEDES TAINOT Mr. Crowne? A moment please? 
CALIMERIS Why doesn't she just throw herself at him? 
PINEDO This is bordering on harassment now. 
DIBIASI Quiet down. I'm watching the TV show... 
MACK Why doesn't this ever happen to me? 
MERCEDES TAINOT I need a few moments alone with Mr. Crowne thank you. 
DIBIASI Move along folks. Privacy's a right in this great nation of ours. 
MACK You want I should close this door, lock it, and barricade it so you won't be disturbed?? We hear them cackling like geese in the hall. 
LARRY CROWNE How are the Triplets? Groggy, Puffy, and Grumpy. He means the hangover. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Last night was a confluence of too many things happening in too short 
a time span. 
LARRY CROWNE Last i ht? Let's see, what was I doing? Studying some. Working some. Can't recall. I've forgotten everything that happened last night as best a gentleman can. 
MERCEDES TAINOT I had no right to judge you or your relationships. Date who you want. Larry has no idea what that means. 
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) But what happened last night -- between adults -- was inappropriate. If gossip were to circulate, the problem could be more than just embarrassing. My status as a professor could be tarnished. 
LARRY CROWNE I wouldn't want that. 
MERCEDES TAINOT happened before. 
(MORE) 
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) With parking attendants. Strangers at parties when I've had a bit too much of the demon rum. This was the first time with a student. 
(THEN) I hope the entire thing will be forgotten. Larry has just had his feelings hurt by his teacher. 
LARRY CROWNE Sure. Nothing happened. At all. 
MERCEDES TAINOT So there will be no bravado among you and your pals? 
LARRY CROWNE None. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Thank you, Mr. Crowne. 
LARRY CROWNE 
I'd better scurry along to Dr. 
Matsutani's class. I hope I don't have this same conversation with him. Larry leaves - a good mood ruined... Mercy watches him go. What is going on behind those dark glasses? 
EXT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - AFTERNOON 
Larry and Lamarr are sitting on the curb, watching kids play down the street. They run back and forth in front of them with a soccer ball. They both have pipes, with Lamarr showing him how to light up. 
MERCEDES TAINOT I knew you'd be on the computer. 
(THEN) Working... 
DEAN TAINOT Point made. 
(THEN) So. What up. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Are we making a mistake here? 
DEAN TAINOT 
MERCEDES TAINOT Point made. We could change things. We could start right now. 
DEAN TAINOT We could. Why should we? 
MERCEDES TAINOT Because we have history, Dean. But first, my thoughts... I've got to address drinking. I should be able to comprehend and respond to both sides of our conversations. And the morning shower should be refreshing, not a hangover cure. 
DEAN TAINOT I'd like that too. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Really? 
DEAN TAINOT You're not a pleasant woman after a 
few glasses. Mornings with you are 
to be survived. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Okay. Now, you. Dean is caught short. 
DEAN TAINOT I see. I'm what this is all about. 
MERCEDES TAINOT There are plenty of items on the relationship agenda but let's start here. 
DEAN TAINOT You're talking about you but you really mean me. 
(THEN) I am not yelling or begging or saying you have to stop doing anything. So you don't get to either. 
MERCEDES TAINOT I'm not saying that. 
DEAN TAINOT We've both been here before. Why prolong the process? White flag! I give up. This ain't working. 
(THEN) I'll sign papers and checks, see if there's enough for a cool sports car as a reward for the last few years and eventually I will be fine and you will too. But I am never once going to look at myself as another poor divorced guy who could still be married if only he had done the mea culpa bit for all his faults. 
(THEN) I just now came up with that, and it is going to be my next posting. He pulls out his Blackberry and makes a note to himself. 
DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D) I don't think there is anything else to talk about. Do you? 
Mercedes looks at him. She has been a fool... 
EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOME - PATIO 
Mercy -- Margarita pitcher handy -- is still writing words on paper, and drinking. Alone. Not good. 
EXT. E.C.C.C. PARKING LOT - MORNING 
The sign reads "FINALS WEEK: ENROLL FOR SPRING QUARTER." 
INT. SPEECH 217 - MORNING 
She is in the front of the class with a small box. Hungover? A bit, yes... 
MERCEDES TAINOT Here I have surprise topics. Friday, in a Lightning Round, you must wax on that topic for 2 minutes without pause, repetition, or lack of charm. No notes. One visual aid. 
(THEN) Ms Pinedo Draw 
Ms. Pinedo pulls a paper from the box. 
MS. PINEDO 'Potatoes?' 
MERCEDES TAINOT Spuds. Can't wait. Dibiasi draws a paper. 
DIBIASI 'Disraeli'? What is that? 
MERCEDES TAINOT Who is that? 
DIBIASI It's a guy from Disrael. I'm done. Now it's Larry's turn. He shyly draws a paper -- a bit uncomfortable in class since the recent events. 
LARRY CROWNE 'Consumerism'. 
MERCEDES TAINOT 
That's supposed to say 'Communism.' 
The FOR SALE sign on his lawn has an addition: IN ESCROW 
INT. SPEECH 217 - LATER 
On the projected computer screen: A portrait of DISRAELI. 
Dibiasi is giving his speech, but we are hearing Mercedes... 
MERCEDES TAINOT What a difference from day one. I must be a better teacher than I thought. 
(THEN) Dibiasi is nailing it. Calimeris stopped up-talking. Lala you can't shut up. Mack spoke about Australia for three minutes and mentioned kangaroos only twice. And Larry Crowne... Larry is listening to Dibiasi, wearing what was once his UniMart polo, with his nametag and everything. Compared to the man he is now, that polo looks out of place.. 
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) I was tough on him. But he learned fast. How he connected the Circle of Sales to the expanding universe is impressive as hell. I'll never forget about the Value Index now. He gave a perfect speech. 
(THEN) And... He's polite. Instead of fighting me off that night, what does he do but kisses me one and then all but tucks me in. What kind of guy does that to a loopy tramp like me? He could have ravaged me. I misread this guy and if I had a brain I'd find a way to steal him away from that cutie pie and keep him for myself. I wonder if he'd like that, if he would... What did I just say? 
(THEN) What did I just say about Larry Crowne? The class has stopped. It seems that Mercedes just said that last bit out loud and everyone heard it. The women eye each other. The men stifle laughs. 
DIBIASI 
Nothing. And I was just wrapping up here. 
MERCEDES TAINOT I'm so sorry. Please go on. 
DIBIASI Larry? It okay if I get to my climax and denouement? Larry nods. 
DIBIASI (CONT'D) Thank you... If it was the romance novelist in him that made Victoria the Queen become such a pal, chalk it up as another brick in the legacy of Ben Disraeli -- Earl of Beaconsfield - Educator - and Prime Minister of Great Britain. Not bad for a Jewish guy, huh? Dibiasi is done. Applause. 
PINEDO Not so much as a bump, Nomad! Why'd you go last? 
DIBIASI Fourth quarter dramatics. 
(THEN) Not that it mattered to my Speech professor... 
MERCEDES TAINOT Congratulations all of you. 
MACK Who's the MVP, Mrs. Tainot? Can we vote? 
MERCEDES TAINOT Not me, I have to stay objective. 
MACK I say... Lala! They all say Lala! It's unanimous! They start chanting her name. "La la! La la! La la!" -- embarrassing her. Larry sits her down in her chair and gets the other guys to pick her up like she's the bride at a wedding. 
It's a spontaneous party that Mercedes has to back out of. 
As she leaves, she looks back long enough to see Larry Crowne leading a parade around the room. 
INT. ECON. 1 - LATER 
Everyone is taking the final. 
Dr. Matsutani. Looking around the class. Using his hands like a pair of binoculars. Lala is using a thesaurus and dictionary to polish answers. 
Larry is finished. He walks up to Dr. M. and hands in his Blue Book. 
DR. MATSUTANI The first to finish. No surprise. Dr. Matsutani hands Larry his confiscated phone. Larry leaves. 
INT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - KITCHEN 
The final utensils are going into a box. Larry is doing this part himself. He sits for a moment -- in the breakfast nook -- surveying his kitchen, what was once his. Mack comes in with a box of his LP's. 
MACK This is the last of them. Damn, you have a lot of records. 
LARRY CROWNE Priceless at a buck apiece. 
EXT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - LATER 
His furnishings are out on the lawn. Lamarr and Patience are looking them over. Mack and Dibiasi are putting the last of his things into Mack's huge SUV and Larry's car. 
PATIENCE 
A two-bedroom apartment and you don't have room for your furniture? 
LAMARR Selling this futon-sofabed? All those years across the street and you've learned nothing. 
(THEN) What's the minimum you'll take for this stuff? 
LARRY CROWNE You'll get me top price. 
LAMARR You did learn. 
DIBIASI Pizza at last! 
LARRY CROWNE Here's lunch as promised! The BIG STORK PIZZA GUY pulls up in a different car but the same sign. 
LARRY CROWNE Cars not much. Devices some. They rise. 
EXT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - PARKING LOT - SAME 
Mercy is opening her door, starting her car. 
GPS VOICE Please enter your destination. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Oh be quiet. That's a MapGenie. 
MERCEDES TAINOT It is Hellspawn. 
LARRY CROWNE In my old job, I'd have steered you to a Vortex unit. The MapGenie interface is clumsy and the menu needs too many inputs. He is reaching into the car, across her to tap the unit. 
MERCEDES TAINOT It was working fine. Then I think I pressed too many buttons. 
LARRY CROWNE Ah. The Auto On Feature is engaged. Menu. Select. Features. Auto Voice. Select. Change? Yes. On. Off. Done? Yes. Save. Back. Back. Back. Exit. While he was doing that, Mercedes was smelling what she could of Larry. She liked it. She looked at his neck, his ears. And smelled him. 
LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D) 
How long was this broken? 
MERCEDES TAINOT Seemed like years and years. 
LARRY CROWNE All better now. Should be able to find your way. Nothing to do now but say goodbye. 
They hear a pounding. 
Raul is at the window inside the cafe, signaling the break is over. 
LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D) My Boss. Back to work. 
(THEN) Thanks for the good news... 
INT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - SAME 
Perry greets him at the door. 
PERRY Kimosabe, holding off til after school to woo the teacher is the move of a class act. Larry turns to watch Mercedes drive away. 
EXT. E.C.C.C. PARKING LOT - MORNING 
The sign says "New Term Beginning! $20 a unit! Ask about Financial Aid!" Did you notice? The cost of an education just went up... 
INT. PORTABLE CLASSROOM - DAY 
Mercedes has just written "Care" next to "Welcome to Shakespeare!!" up on the board. She turns. And does a quick head count. Only 6 students are enrolled. She's going to lose this one, again. Clumps up the wooden steps are heard... 
Calimeris, Mack, Pinedo, and Dibiasi come tramping in. Twelve 
students now. 
DIBIASI (on his phone) I gotta get off, Baby, or I'm in hot water with Professor Tai-bo... Mercy does a Shakespearean dance of joy. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Is Larry with you? 
CALIMERIS Um, no. Should we track him down and drag him in here? Mercedes does her best to hide her disappointment. 
MERCEDES TAINOT I... Seeing you all... I just thought... 
(THEN) Choose a seat and lets get started! The four smile at each other... 
PINEDO Carrying a torch for Larry til it burns her hands... 
EXT. E.C.C.C. CAMPUS - LATER 
Mercedes is walking to another building, another class. 
She may not realize it, but she is looking for Larry Crowne. Busik is busy chatting her up. Seriously chatting her up. 
BUSIK All the excitement of first day of term, I don't want to go back to my empty apartment. Do you? I need a drink and some talk and some wind- down time. Don't you? 
DR. MATSUTANI (O.C.) Ms. Tainot? She turns. 
MERCEDES TAINOT 
Dr. M. 
DR. MATSUTANI Larry Crowne is taking six units from me, devouring the material like a starving man. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Larry's enrolled? 
DR. MATSUTANI He's continuing his education and tells me it is because of you. That your class changed his life. Mercedes finds herself smiling -- beaming...

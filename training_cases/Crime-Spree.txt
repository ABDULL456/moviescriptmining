FADE IN: 
INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT 
Pitch dark. We hear two men speaking FRENCH in hushed voices. NOTE: All dialogue is in French until otherwise noted. 
DANIEL (whispering) Turn on the flashlight. 
JULIEN I'm trying.    It doesn't work. 
DANIEL It has to work. You just bought it this afternoon. 
A beat. 
JULIEN Do they come with batteries? 
DANIEL You didn't buy batteries? 
JULIEN I thought they came with batteries. 
DANIEL I can't believe you didn't check. 
JULIEN I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list. 
DANIEL Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires. 
EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT 
A wealthy neighborhood of Paris off the Champs Elysees. Large homes line the secluded street. We see the silhouette of a man in a Peugeot. We MOVE IN closer to see RAYMOND GAYET, 30's, waits nervously. 
INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT 
Dark. DANIEL FORAY lights his Zippo lighter. He is late 30's, tall, handsome with eyes that seem to twinkle in the glow of the flame. Beside him is JULIEN LABESSE, 30's, hyper. Daniel places the LIGHTER on a small table and moves over to a PAINTING on the wall. Daniel stops at one, removes a pen knife and starts to cut the canvas from the frame. Daniel rolls up the canvas. 
DANIEL Let's go. 
Julien starts to pick up the ZIPPO. 
DANIEL Be careful it's... 
Too Late! Julien has already picked it up. It burns his hand ans he flicks it away. It flies through the air and lands in the corner of the room. The CURTAINS catch on fire. 
DANIEL ... hot! 
Julien panics! He grabs the canvas out of Daniel's hand and begins beating the flames with it. Daniel looks at him with disbelief. Julien flails his arms wildly as he beats back the flames. He turns to Daniel pleased that his efforts have extinguished the fire, but unaware that the canvas has now caught on fire. A beat. Julien sees the flames and puts them out. Daniel just stares at him. He opens the canvas. The painting is ruined. 
EXT. STREET -- NIGHT 
A Mercedes parks in front of the Peugeot, boxing it in between it and a car behind it. The DRIVER gets out and walks away. 
INT. HOUSE FOYER -- NIGHT 
Daniel and Julien move through the darkness. 
DANIEL Light your lighter. I can't see anything... and try not to burn down the house! 
Julien remove a lighter and presses it. The entire room fills with light. Julien stares at the flame amazed. 
OLD MAN'S VOICE Don't move! 
They turn to see an old man standing at the top of the stairs in his bathrobe. He is frail, his face pasty white. He is holding a very long, double-barrel shotgun. Julien looks to Daniel with a 'what now' expression. The old man slowly moves down the stairs. He loses his balance and falls down the stairs, tumbling head over heals until he reaches the bottom. Daniel and Julien stare at the old man who is sprawled out on the floor, motionless. 
JULIEN Is he dead? 
DANIEL I don't know.     He looks dead. 
JULIEN He looked dead before he fell. 
The old man groans, then opens his eyes.    He grabs his shotgun. Daniel and Julien run to the door. 
EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT 
Daniel and Julien run towards the street. 
DANIEL Start the car! Start the car! 
Raymond starts the engine.   Daniel and Julien rush across the street and get in the back seat. Raymond tries to pull out but there are only a few inches between the Mercedes in front and the car behind. Like a pinball stuck between two bumpers the Peugeot jerks rapidly back and forth. 
INT. PEUGEOT -- CONTINUOUS 
Quick cuts of the familiar sights of the city. The Sears building. Chicago board of trade building. Grant park. Then with each successive cut the beauty of the city seems to fade until we are in... 
EXT. STREET -- MORNING 
An industrial section of the city. Empty streets. Run down buildings. Graffiti filled walls and burnt out hulls of abandoned cars line the street. The taxi driver leans out his window. 
TAXI DRIVER Are you sure you guys have the right address? This ain't no tourist area. 
Marcel looks at a piece of paper he is holding. 
MARCEL Yes.   We are sure. 
The taxi speeds off, leaving them standing on the sidewalk, their bags in a pile. Suddenly, from out of nowhere three BLACK TOUGHS appear and walk over. Daniel looks behind him and sees another two approaching from the rear. Zero calmly sits down on one of the suitcases. 
SAMI Let me handle this. 
LAMAR, 30's, the leader of the group steps forward. 
SAMI Hey, brother.     What's happening, man? 
Sami raises his hand as if to greet Lamar. 
LAMAR Don't you brother me, motherfucker. 
Sami looks like an idiot with his hand up in the air.   He casually lowers it. Lamar looks over the group and grins. 
LAMAR What's in the bags? 
JULIEN Dirty underwear. 
Lamar forces a laugh. 
LAMAR Dirty underwear. That's a good one. Let me explain something to you. This is my street and you're gonna give me want I what or I'm gonna bust your heads open. 
Raymond steps forward and places his hand on Lamar's arm. 
RAYMOND Lamar, violence is never an answer to settling disputes. I can see you have a lot of anger... but this is not the way to get it out. 
LAMAR Get outta my face! 
Lamar removes a knife. The others in his group bring out an assortment of clubs, chains and pipes. 
LAMAR Now, are you going to give me the suitcases? Or are we going to have to take them? 
Zero is still sitting on one of the suitcases. 
ZERO Va te faire foutre! 
LAMAR What did he say? 
DANIEL He said to go fuck yourself. 
ZERO We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass. 
LAMAR Who is Zero? 
JULIEN He is. 
LAMAR (to Julien) He speaks about himself in the third person? 
Julien shrugs his shoulders. 
LAMAR Maybe Zero would like to get off his ass and take my knife from me? 
ZERO If you insist. 
Zero stands up and raises his hand.   He is holding a .9mm Glock. He aims it at Lamar's head. 
Lamar's brave exterior quickly fades now that he is looking down the barrel of the gun. The rest of his gang turns and runs away. Zero aims the gun at his groin. 
ZERO Leave now before Zero shoots off those little raisins you call balls. 
Lamar runs away. Daniel and the others smile at Zero as they pick up their bags and walk towards a building. 
Zero is left with Sami who stares at him with disbelief. 
SAMI You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that? 
ZERO Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours. 
Zero grins and walks away. 
EXT. WAREHOUSE -- MORNING 
The crew stands at a door. Marcel knocks.     A peep-hole in the door is opened and an eye looks them over. 
MARCEL We are looking for Sophie.    Laurant send us. 
The door is opened by SOPHIE (the girl in the photo on Bastaldi's computer). She is late 20's, beautiful. 
Vinny gets off his knees and moves towards Zammito. 
ZAMMITO You bleed on me, I'll kill ya. 
Vinny takes a step back. 
ZAMMITO What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that? (to Joey) What'd I say to him? 
JOEY "TWO TONS" You said don't do it, boss. 
ZAMMITO That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate. 
VINNY Frankie, I -- 
ZAMMITO -- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine. (to Joey and Nicky) Break his arm. 
Vinny looks up at Zammito through pleading eyes. 
VINNY Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother! 
ZAMMITO That's why we're only breaking one arm. 
INT. COFFEE SHOP -- LATER -- AFTERNOON 
The table is littered with plates.   Sophie has sketched out a diagram of a house on her napkin. 
SOPHIE There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom. 
JULIEN I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem. 
SAMI After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window. 
DANIEL (impressed) Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door. 
JULIEN What about transportation? 
SOPHIE You can use my car. 
DANIEL Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one. 
RAYMOND No problem. 
SAMI When do we go? 
SOPHIE Tonight. 
DANIEL Tonight? 
SOPHIE I know they won't be home tonight. 
SAMI You ever hear of jet lag? 
SOPHIE Take a nap. 
EXT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON 
As they crew and Sophie approach the door we hear the muted roar of loud MUSIC. 
INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON 
As the enter the music is even louder. The bass pounds through the walls. Wayne seems oblivious to it as he sits on the couch smoking a joint. 
JULIEN What the hell is that? 
WAYNE Neighbors.    They do this all the time. 
SAMI I can't even hear myself think. 
ZERO How are we supposed to sleep with this noise? 
SOPHIE I've asked them a hundred times to keep in down. They don't listen. 
RAYMOND I will talk to them. 
Sophie and Wayne both find his offer amusing. 
WAYNE Yeah.   Right. 
SOPHIE Not a good idea. 
RAYMOND It's just a matter of communication. 
Raymond leaves. 
EXT. SIDE OF WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON 
Raymond walks towards a door at the end of the building. The MUSIC grows louder. He KNOCKS on the door and waits. It is opened by a very large man... a biker type, leather jacket, full beard, several long earrings hanging from his ear. He is holding a BEER BOTTLE. Behind him are two other rough-looking men. 
RAYMOND (cheerfully; loudly over the music) Hello. My name is Raymond. I am visiting next door and I was wondering if you could make your music a little less loud. 
BOBBY BEANS To tell you that we're interested in the property. 
ZAMMITO You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table. 
BOBBY BEANS I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano. 
ZAMMITO Yeah -- you do that. 
Bobby Beans leaves. 
ZAMMITO Jerk-wad! 
Zammito looks over at Joey and Nicky. 
ZAMMITO How's my brother? 
NICKY "THE RAKE" He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm. 
ZAMMITO I said a clean break. 
JOEY "TWO TONS" Hey boss, it's not a science. 
ZAMMITO Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards. 
Nicky gets up to carry out his instructions. 
ZAMMITO Oh and uh, send a case of steaks over to his house. I don't want the kids to go hungry while he's recuperating. 
INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- LATER -- AFTERNOON 
Julien and Zero are playing cards at the back of the room. Sami sitting by himself sorting through a BLACK CANVAS BAG filled with shoes. Sophie joins him. Sami pulls another pair of shoes out of the canvas bag. 
SOPHIE You like shoes? 
SAMI No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight. 
SOPHIE It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it. 
Sami dumps the rest of the shoes out of the bag. 
SOPHIE So, how did you get hooked up with these guys? 
SAMI Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's? 
SOPHIE The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information. 
SAMI So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed? 
SOPHIE They're not nice people. 
She sees a TATTOO on Sami's arm.    It's a heart with someone's faded name. 
SOPHIE I like your tattoo. 
Sami is suddenly self-conscious of it.    She traces along the letters with her finger. 
SOPHIE (reading the name) Casandra. Old girlfriend? 
SAMI Something like that. 
SOPHIE Did she break your heart? 
SAMI Something like that. 
SOPHIE It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago? 
SAMI You ask a lot of questions. 
SOPHIE That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it? 
SAMI I don't remember.    I was drunk. 
SOPHIE You got it in a bar? 
SAMI No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy? 
SOPHIE Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry. 
SAMI It's okay.   It was a long time ago. 
SOPHIE I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass. 
Sami looks at her quizzically. 
SAMI Who's gonna see it there? 
SOPHIE The lucky ones. 
She smiles flirtatiously and walks away. 
Zammito thinks it over. 
ZAMMITO Okay.    I'm coming. 
He walks over to the MARIO, the OWNER of the restaurant. 
ZAMMITO Mario, I gotta go. When my date arrives tell her I had an emergency. 
MARIO Of course, Mr. Zammito. 
EXT. WRIGLEY FIELD STADIUM -- NIGHT 
The Impala is stopped in the parking lot. 
RAYMOND (V.O.) I think we went the wrong way. 
SAMI (V.O.) Oh, you think? 
MARCEL (V.O.) The map said to go left. 
JULIEN (V.O.) Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right. 
MARCEL (V.O.) (amused) Oh yeah. 
INT. BONANNO'S HOUSE, STUDY -- EVENING 
Zammito enters to find ANGELO BONANNO, 60's, powerful, head of the Chicago Mob. He is smoking a cigar with a glass of brandy. 
BONANNO Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something? 
ZAMMITO No, I'm good, Angelo. 
Bonanno motions to the couch.    Zammito sits down. 
BONANNO I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today. 
ZAMMITO Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse. 
BONANNO And? 
ZAMMITO And nothing.     He's just feeling us out. 
BONANNO He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory. 
ZAMMITO He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off. 
BONANNO Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property. 
ZAMMITO I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary. 
Bonanno stares at him. 
BONANNO They're gonna be what? 
ZAMMITO Supernumerary. It means better than expected. 
BONANNO Good word. 
Half Tooth Tony, 30's, built like a tank step into the room. He has the face of a boxer, several of his teeth are chipped or broken. 
HALF TOOTH TONY Mr. Bonanno, I just wanted to remind you that you have an appointment in ten minutes. 
Half Tooth Tony leaves. 
ZAMMITO Someone else coming? 
BONANNO Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it? 
ZAMMITO Uh, no -- 
BONANNO You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me. 
ZAMMITO You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you. 
Bonanno affectionately slaps Zammito's cheeks. 
BONANNO Go.   Rest. 
Bonanno takes a sip of his brandy, but his eyes stay on Zammito. 
BONANNO Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother? 
ZAMMITO He missed three weeks. 
BONANNO Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it? 
ZAMMITO I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed. 
BONANNO But you were there? 
FBI AGENT Should I call C.P.D.? 
AGENT HADLEY Yeah, but tell them not to move until these morons come out of the house. 
INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
BLACK SCREEN. From inside the safe we see Julien open the door. Daniel and Julien look inside. There are a several stacks of cash, envelopes and a small cardboard box. Julien starts removing everything and puts it into the bag canvas bag. 
JULIEN Where are the jewels?   There aren't any jewels. 
Marcel looks as surprised as they are. 
MARCEL There has to be. 
JULIEN I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels. 
MARCEL There must be half a million dollars here though. 
DANIEL Marcel, we came here for jewels, remember? Sami moves closer to Zammito, studying his face. He moves over to the dresser where there are several photographs of Zammito with various famous people. Next to the photographs is a plaque that reads: TO FRANCIS ZAMMITO... 
We can see the color drain from Sami's face. He glances over at Zammito whose eyes are locked on his. Sami grabs Daniel and Marcel and pulls them aside. 
SAMI (babbling nervously) We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe -- (flatly) Do you know who that is? 
MARCEL Mr. Taylor? 
SAMI No, that's not Mr. Taylor. 
DANIEL (sensing something bad is coming) It's not? 
SAMI That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia. 
MARCEL (confused) Why would they want us to rob the Mafia? 
SAMI (screaming) 
WE'RE IN THE WRONG HOUSE, YOU FUCKIN' 
IDIOT! 
A beat. The three of them turn and look at Zammito. The seriousness of the situation finally dawns on Marcel. He moves over to Zammito and rips the tape off his mouth. 
MARCEL Mr. Zammito, there seems to have been a big mistake here. May I use your phone? 
ZAMMITO Feel free. 
Marcel picks up the cordless phone and dials. 
QUICK CUT TO: 
INT. BASTALDI'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 
Bastaldi removes a sleep mask and answers the phone. 
BASTALDI Hello? 
MARCEL (V.O.) (in French) It's Elvis... 
BASTALDI Who? 
MARCEL (V.O.) (in French) It's me... 
BASTALDI Marcel? 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
Marcel continues his conversation. 
MARCEL (in French) Yes. (More) 
MARCEL (Cont'd) We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy. 
BASTALDI (V.O.) (in French) You're there now? 
MARCEL Oui. 
BASTALDI (in French) You're calling me on your cell phone, right? 
MARCEL No. 
BASTALDI (V.O.) (in French) You're calling me on is phone? 
MARCEL Oui. 
BASTALDI (V.O.) (in French) My number's going to show up on his bill! 
MARCEL (In French) Should I call you back? 
JULIEN Bastaldi got the address from you, yes? 
SOPHIE Yes. 
JULIEN And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road. 
SOPHIE No.    145 Ridgeroad Way. 
DANIEL That moron. 
MARCEL It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road. 
DANIEL Everyone get some sleep.    We're leaving in the morning. 
INT. SURVEILLANCE HOUSE -- NIGHT 
Agent Hadley checks his watch. 
AGENT HADLEY What the hell are they doing in there? 
FBI AGENT Chicago P.D. says they can't hold the units here any longer. They want to know if they should go in? 
Agent Hadley thinks a moment. 
AGENT HADLEY Tell them no.     We'll advise if anything changes. 
INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
Zammito is still tied to his chair. HIS POV -- of the cordless phone of his bed. He pushes with his feet, sliding the chair over to the bed, then starts rocking back and forth until he tips over forward, his face pressed against the mattress. Using his nose he turns on the phone and presses a speed dial number. 
INT. JOEY TWO TONS BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
Joey "Two Tons" is asleep in a sleeveless tee shirt. Next to him is his wife, her hair in curlers, her eyes covered by a black sleep mask. The phone rings. Joey answers it. 
JOEY "TWO TONS" Yeah? 
We hear Zammito's muffled cries for help. It almost sounds like someone moaning during a sexual act. Joey is surprised at first, then glances over at his wife to make sure she is asleep. He slides his hand under the covers and closes his eyes. 
JOEY "TWO TONS" (quietly) Hmmm.... Oh yeah... Uh huh 
INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
Zammito stops as he begins to realize what Joey is doing on the other end of the line. He grimaces, then shouts louder. 
INT. JOEY TWO TONS BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
Joey is really going to town now as his hand moves slowly under the covers. We hear a loud scream on the phone. 
JOEY "TWO TONS" That's right baby, give it to papa Joey. 
He is really deep into his fantasy world when... 
JOEY "TWO TONS" WIFE Joey, who is that? 
Joey sits up quickly. 
JOEY "TWO TONS" (loudly; for his wife's sake) -- And don't call here again, you pervert. 
He slams the phone down. A long beat. It rings again. This time he checks his caller ID and sees that call is coming from Zammito's house. 
JOEY "TWO TONS" Yeah boss? 
Again we hear the same muffled cries. 
JOEY "TWO TONS" Boss? 
INT. BODY SHOP -- NIGHT 
Raphael enters with Hector and two GANG-BANGERS.   The room is filled with low rider cars. 
Working under the hood of a car is FELIX, 30's, sleazy. Raphael walks over and slams the hood down, pinning Felix's upper body and squishing his face between the hood and engine. 
RAPHAEL Someone stole my car tonight! 
FELIX C'mon Raphael, you don't think that I would steal your car? 
RAPHAEL You run a chop shop for low riders. Yes, I think you'd steal my car. 
Raphael lifts up the hood and slams it down on Felix again. 
FELIX I swear I didn't. I wouldn't! 
RAPHAEL And I should just believe-- 
HECTOR (overlapping; to Felix) -- you stole my cousin Enrique's car. 
RAPHAEL (to Hector) Hector, don't interrupt me. 
HECTOR He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car. 
She grins seductively, then leans in towards him. 
SOPHIE I can think of something. They kiss. 
INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MORNING 
Sami is asleep on the floor, curled up under several blankets. He wakes up and looks to his side expecting to find Sophie. She is not there. Sami looks around for her. Wayne is sitting on the couch preparing his morning joint. 
WAYNE She's not here, man. 
SAMI Where is she? 
WAYNE I think she went to do some laundry. Threw some stuff in a bag and left. 
It takes a moment for Sami to connect the thoughts. 
SAMI Bag? Sami runs to the table.      The black canvas bag is gone. CLOSE ON DANIEL:    Asleep.    Sami shakes him.   He opens his eyes. 
SAMI Get up.   We've been ripped off! 
INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 
Daniel and Sami are with the crew. They are not a happy bunch. Wayne is smoking his joint, his eyes locked on the television. 
JULIEN Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days. 
RAYMOND She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare. 
A thought occurs to Sami. 
SAMI Not everything. 
He removes the tape he put in the cassette deck last night before Sophie entered. 
SAMI I was going to listen to it last night but I -- 
He realizes it may not be the time to tell them what happened. 
SAMI -- feel asleep. 
Wayne blurts out a sloppy laugh. 
WAYNE No you didn't, dude. You were bangin' Sophie. I saw you guys going at it. 
DANIEL You slept with her? 
SAMI Well, actually I would say she slept with me. 
Daniel stares at him angrily. 
SAMI What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something. 
DANIEL You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you? 
SAMI No.   Chicks dig me. 
Daniel grabs the cassette and puts it in the player.   On the tape we hear a phone ringing. 
MAN'S VOICE Hello? 
ZAMMITO'S VOICE It's me. I need an answer from you if I'm going to move. 
MAN'S VOICE We're not just talkin' about a 'piece of work' here. We're talking about a boss. 
Sami is the first to realize what he is hearing. 
SAMI Holy shit. 
RAYMOND What? 
Sami holds his hand signaling them to be quiet so he can hear the rest. 
ZAMMITO'S VOICE Bonanno's a dinosaur. Guy thinks he's fuckin' Vito Corleone or something. The old ways are gone. If we don't change now we're going to get pushed out. I need to know if I can count on your support? 
A pause on the line. 
MAN'S VOICE Yeah. 
The line goes dead.    Sami leans back. 
SAMI No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family. 
JULIEN This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war. 
MARCEL The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is. 
DANIEL You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you. 
JULIEN I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself? 
She stares at them defiantly. 
SAMI Who are you waiting for? 
SOPHIE Stick around and find out. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM -- LATER -- MORNING 
A knock on the door. Sami clamps his hand over Sophie's mouth just in case she gets any stupid ideas. Daniel opens the door. Agent Hadley steps in, stares at Daniel, then feels the barrel of Zero's gun pressed against his head. 
Hadley steps into the room. Daniel closes the door. Zero searches him. Finds a gun which he gives to Daniel, then a wallet. He opens it and sees his FBI identification. 
ZERO He's FBI. 
Zero knowingly bends down and removes Hadley's backup gun which is strapped to his ankle. He gives the gun to Sami. 
RAYMOND What is she doing with an agent du FBI? 
Sami looks at her -- at Hadley -- at the black canvas bag.    Slowly it starts to come together in his mind. 
SAMI We've been set up. 
He stares at Sophie angrily. 
SAMI We didn't go to the wrong house. We went to right one, didn't we Sophie? 
Her expression gives away nothing. 
SAMI They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why? (beat) Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us. 
ZERO What does arresting us get them? 
SAMI (to Hadley) You wanna tell him? 
AGENT HADLEY You're telling it fine. 
Daniel motions to Zero. 
DANIEL You see my friend over there? I nod to him and he's going to put a bullet in your knee. 
Zero stares at Hadley, just waiting for Daniel to give him the go ahead. 
AGENT HADLEY You wouldn't. 
Daniel nods.   Zero aims his gun at Hadley's knee cap. 
AGENT HADLEY That's going to make a lot of noise. Not much time for a conversation after you pull the trigger. 
They know he's right. 
SAMI He's got a point. 
Sami lifts up a heavy brass lamp from the nightstand. He pulls the electrical cord out of the base, then touches two wires together. They spark. Before Hadley can say a word Sami touches them to his hand. Hadley's body jerks violent as he screams. Sami removes the wires. Hadley winces in pain from the burn mark on his hand. 
AGENT HADLEY Okay! Okay! We've been investigating Zammito for years, but we've never had enough evidence for a warrant to search his house. We got word through a snitch that Zammito was planning on taking Bonanno out. 
DANIEL We know all this. 
AGENT HADLEY You just don't take out a boss. You need permission from the other families to do something like that. Our informant told us that Zammito was talking with other bosses and recording their conversations in case they later claimed they weren't involved. Look at these tapes. The guy has recorded every conversation he's had for years. 
DANIEL So we rob Zammito. You arrest us when we come out and the contents of the safe is now evidence which you can use against him. 
Agent Hadley nods. 
SAMI (to Sophie) What are you getting out of this?

We see Zammito walk over to Mario. 
ZAMMITO Mario, I gotta go. When my date arrives will you explain to her I had an emergency. 
MARIO Of course, Mr. Zammito. 
Zammito leaves. Through the window we see Joey "Two Tons" open the door to the car. Zammito and Joey get in and drive away. A beat. A Taxi pulls up. The front door opens and Sophie enters, all dressed up and beautiful. She walks up to Mario. 
SOPHIE Hi.    I'm meeting Frankie Zammito --

INT. MOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
EXT. STREET, SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MORNING 
Marcel, Julien and Wayne are waiting as the Impala drives up. Raymond hops out of the car. 
RAYMOND I would like to thank you for your hospitality. (hands him a card) If you are ever in Paris here is my number. 
WAYNE Cool. 
Marcel grabs Raymond and leads him back to the car.    Daniel sees Lamar standing across the street. 
DANIEL (to the others) I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him. 
LAMAR What do you want now? 
DANIEL Guns.   Can you get them? 
LAMAR Man, I can get anything. 
DANIEL Don't bullshit me. 
LAMAR I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible? 
DANIEL I've got a way with people. 
LAMAR I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya? 
DANIEL I'm from Belgium. 
LAMAR Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you. 
DANIEL Why haven't you turned us in? 
LAMAR I ain't no rat. (beat) You got money, right? 
Daniel nods. 
LAMAR And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee. 
DANIEL How much? 
LAMAR A thousand dollars? 
DANIEL Fine. 
Daniel hands him his cell phone. 
DANIEL Take this. I'll call you in a few hours. You tell me where we meet. 
INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- DAY 
Wayne is on the couch watching TV. There is a loud knock on the door. He opens the door to find Agent Hadley. 
WAYNE Yeah? 
Hadley pushes past Wayne and enters. 
WAYNE Hey dude, what do you think you're doing? 
Hadley flashes his badge. 
WAYNE Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something? 
AGENT HADLEY Not today.   Where are your friends? 
WAYNE They left about a half hour ago. 
AGENT HADLEY Where did they go? 
WAYNE I dunno. 
Hadley punches Wayne in the face.    Wayne falls to the floor. 
WAYNE Hey man, you can't do that! 
AGENT HADLEY What?   This? 
Agent Hadley kicks Wayne in the chest. 
AGENT HADLEY Or this? 
Agent Hadley kicks Wayne in the ribs. 
WAYNE Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you? 
AGENT HADLEY I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go? 
WAYNE I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago. (points to coffee table) All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris. 
Hadley sees the phone number Raymond gave Wayne on the coffee table. He puts it in his pocket and stares at Wayne, then just for the hell of it gives him one last kick in the ribs. 
Zammito grimaces as the news of the robbery becomes public. 
ZAMMITO Oh, shit!

Sami turns off the television and looks to the others. 
SAMI Hadley -- 
DANIEL Has to be. 
JULIEN (freaking out) This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is? 
SAMI Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool. 
JULIEN Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I? (pretends to think about it) I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city! 
SAMI We've got to get out of here. 
JULIEN That's brilliant! Care to elaborate? 
Sami gets into Julien's face. 
SAMI You're not helping. 
RAYMOND Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us. 
JULIEN Oh, Jesus.    We're dead. 
Julien walks away.    Daniel picks up the phone and dials a number. 
INT. LAMAR'S APARTMENT -- SAME TIME 
The cell phone Daniel gave him rings.      He answers it. 
LAMAR Yeah? 
DANIEL (V.O.) It's me. 
LAMAR Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and-- 
DANIEL (V.O.) (overlapping) -- Did you set it up? 
LAMAR Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred. 
DANIEL (V.O.) We had a deal. 
LAMAR We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime. 
DANIEL (V.O.) Fine.     Ten o'clock. 
The line goes dead.    Lamar grins, happy with the money he's going to make. 
INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING 
The others are looking at Daniel. 
DANIEL Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us. 
Looks even worse on the inside. A dark corridor is lit by bare light bulbs hanging from the ceiling. An old PROSTITUTE walks past them, her smile signaling she is open for business. They arrive at room 211 and knock. The door is opened by a very large BLACK MAN. Behind him we can see Lamar with ELLWOOD, 20's, sun glasses, his neck draped in gold chains. 
BLACK GUY (very loud) I'm gonna have to search you. 
DANIEL We'll save you the trouble. 
Daniel pulls back his jacket to reveal the gun he took from Hadley in his waistband. 
BLACK GUY (loudly) You can't come in here with that. 
Daniel looks past him to Ellwood. 
DANIEL What's wrong with this guy? 
ELLWOOD He's my cousin. He's deaf. 
Daniel removes an envelope full of cash. 
DANIEL We're here to buy, not steal. If you guys are straight there's not going to be a problem. 
Ellwood stomps his foot several times on the floor.   The black guy feels the vibration and turns around. 
ELLWOOD Let them in. 
The black guy steps aside.   Daniel and Zero enter. 
INT. BARCLAY HOTEL ROOM -- MORNING 
Ellwood is sitting on the bed behind several open suitcases displaying a variety of weapons. 
ELLWOOD What can I do you for? 
Daniel looks over the merchandise. 
DANIEL How much for the nines? 
ELLWOOD A grand a piece. 
DANIEL I'll need extra clips and ammo. 
Daniel starts counting out the money. Ellwood points a .357 magnum he's been holding behind the open suitcase at them. 
LAMAR What the hell you doing, Ellwood?   I gave them my word. 
ELLWOOD Zammito's offering twenty grand a head for these guys. You think I'm going to settle for four G's when I can make forty? (to Daniel) All right. Reach in easy and put the gun on the floor. 
Daniel slowly grabs his gun and places it on the floor, then kicks it under the bed. 
ELLWOOD I said put it on the floor, not kick it under the bed. 
Ellwood speaks to his cousin, speaking slowly and enunciating each word so he can read his lips. 
ELLWOOD Get that and add it to my inventory. 
The black guy get on his hands and knees and starts looking for the gun under the bed. As he does Daniel glances over at Zero with a look. Ellwood aims his gun at Zero. 
ELLWOOD I assume you're carrying too? 
Zero opens his coat and reveals his .9mm. 
ELLWOOD Okay, put it on the floor... and do not kick it under the fuckin' bed. 
ZERO (flatly) No. 
He stares at Ellwood calmly through dead, flat eyes. 
ELLWOOD No? Did you just say no? Listen cowboy, if you're thinking about makin' a move, don't. Nobody is that fast. 
ZERO Zero is. 
ELLWOOD Who's Zero? 
LAMAR He is. 
Ellwood is confused. Daniel bolts to his left. Ellwood's eyes leave Lamar for a moment -- it's a moment too long. In a blur of movement Zero has his gun out and fires one shot into Ellwood's forehead. 
Ellwood slumps down on the bed, dead. The black guy who has heard nothing continues searching under the bed. Zero casually picks up the suitcase filled with guns and hands it to Daniel. They walk out of the room. Lamar stands there, stunned, then quickly runs after them. 
A beat. The black guy pops up with Daniel's gun oblivious to what has transpired in the room. 
BLACK GUY Found it! 
EXT. BARCLAY HOTEL -- MORNING 
Daniel pushes Lamar out the door. Zero steps out behind him. He stares at Lamar for a long moment, then hands him the envelope. 
DANIEL There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do. 
LAMAR What? 
Zammito leaves.    Vinny can only shake his head in bewilderment. 
EXT. TATTOO SHOP -- DAY 
Several low-rider cars are parked on the street.    Raphael and Hector are with several GANG MEMBERS. 
GANG MEMBER I ain't seen it your car. Sorry man. Hey, you know who you should talk to is Freddy O. 
RAPHAEL I thought he was in prison. 
GANG MEMBER Got out last month. He's trying to go straight but he's still wired in. (More) 
GANG MEMBER (Cont'd) He's working at some restaurant. I'll find out where and call you. 
INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- DAY 
Sami is recording something on a tape deck Marcel bough. He sees Marcel outside on the balcony and removes a piece of paper from his pocket, then picks up the phone and dials. 
AGENT HADLEY (V.O.) Agent Hadley. 
SAMI Do you know who this is? 
AGENT HADLEY (V.O.) Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you. 
SAMI If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue. 
INT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY -- DAY 
The Rental Agent walks back over to Raymond and Julien. 
CAR RENTAL AGENT I'm sorry about the wait. There was a problem with the equipment. 
JULIEN Everything okay now? 
The Rental Agent's eyes drift to a black Lincoln Town Car parked across the street. 
CAR RENTAL AGENT Everything's fine. 
EXT. STREET, ACROSS FROM CAR RENTAL AGENCY -- DAY 
A Lincoln pulls up. Zammito gets out and walks over to three WISEGUYS in another Town Car. One of the Wiseguys points to the window of the rental agency. Zammito looks at Raymond and Julien. 
ZAMMITO I don't know the little one, but the other guy is definitely one of them. Follow them and call me when you find out where they go. 
Zammito walks back to his car and drives off. 
EXT. CAR RENTAL LOT -- DAY 
An EMPLOYEE drives up in a CADILLAC DE VILLE.   He gets out and Julien grabs the keys from him. 
JULIEN (in French) I'll drive. 
RAYMOND (in French) I'm the driver. 
JULIEN (in French) I've never driven a Cadillac before. 
Raymond nods and gets in the passenger seat. 
EXT. STREET -- DAY 
The Cadillac moves down the street.   The Lincoln follows a few cars behind them. 
INT. CADILLAC -- MOVING -- DAY 
Julien drives the car. 
JULIEN (in French) This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven. 
RAYMOND (in French) This is the only American car you've ever driven. 
EXT. GRANT PARK -- DAY 
Agent Hadley walks towards the statue wearing a pair of sun glasses. As he approaches, Sami steps out. 
SAMI You set me up, you piece of shit! 
Hadley pushes him up against the statue and starts frisking him. 
SAMI What are you doing? 
AGENT HADLEY You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired. 
SAMI Wired?    I ain't wired. 
Sami lifts up his shirt showing Hadley his bare chest.   He drops his pants down to his ankles. 
AGENT HADLEY Okay.   Okay.    I believe you. 
SAMI You killed her! 
Raphael and Hector exit.    We move with them through the door into... 
INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL LOBBY -- EVENING 
Raphael and Hector head for the front door. The elevator doors opens and Sami exits. They walk past each other as Sami heads across the lobby and into the gift shop. As Raphael and Hector walk out the front door Agent Hadley steps in walks past them. He goes over to a WOMAN CLERK at the front desk. 
AGENT HADLEY I'd like to see the manager please. 
She walks over to the HOTEL MANAGER and points to Agent Hadley. The Manager walks over. 
HOTEL MANAGER May I help you? 
Agent Hadley shows him his badge. 
AGENT HADLEY I'm looking for several French men who checked in within the last twenty four hours. 
HOTEL MANAGER They checked in last night. 
AGENT HADLEY I need you to take me to their room. 
Agent Hadley follows the manager as they walks towards the elevators and pass... Sami who pretends to read a magazine, covering his face so Hadley will not see him. Sami walks quickly across the lobby and passes... 
Joey "Two Tons", Nicky "The Rake" and three other WISEGUYS enter the hotel. Agent Hadley gets in an elevator with the Hotel Manager. The doors close as the wiseguys approach. 
The moment the doors close Sami bolts into the lobby and over to the house phones. All of them are being used except one. A MAN is just about to lift the receiver when Sami pushes him aside. 
MAN Excuse me.   I was here first. 
Sami ignores him as he waits for the hotel operator to answer. The phone just rings and rings. Behind him another elevator has arrived and the wiseguys enter. Sami's frustration is growing as the phone continues to ring.    The Man who Sami pushed away is still there. 
MAN Hey buddy, you just can't push in here. 
SAMI Go away. 
MAN I most certainly will not go-- 
Sami quickly smacks him on the head with the receiver.   The man slinks away. 
OPERATOR'S VOICE Operator. 
SAMI (into phone) Room 912. 
INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING 
The phone rings. 
DANIEL (to Raymond) Get that, will you? 
RAYMOND Why do I always have to answer the phone? 
DANIEL Because you're the closest. 
RAYMOND I'm not any closer than you are. 
INT. ELEVATOR -- EVENING 
The wiseguys watch the floor indicator. 
INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING 
The phone continues RINGING. 
DANIEL Why is everything an argument with you? 
RAYMOND I'm just setting my boundaries. 
Daniel looks at Raymond and sighs, then gets up and lifts he receiver. 
DANIEL Hello? 
SAMI (V.O.) Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy. 
Daniel slams down the phone.    The others can see the urgency on his face. 
DANIEL Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving! 
RAYMOND Why do I have to pick up the tapes. 
DANIEL Jesus! 
Daniel grabs the canvas bag. 
INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- HALLWAY -- EVENING 
The manager is about to open the door with his key.   Agent Hadley takes it and removes a gun. 
AGENT HADLEY You should go now. 
The manager runs away. Agent Hadley inserts the key and opens the door. His face fills with fear as he sees... AGENT HADLEY'S POV -- Daniel, Marcel, Raymond and Zero are on the other side, their guns pointed at Hadley's head. 
Small. Filled with cheap furniture. A small kitchenette is off to the side of the room. Zero lays on the bed. Daniel uses his belt as tourniquet to slow the bleeding. Raymond sits at the table staring at the black canvas bag containing the cash and tapes. Marcel is in the kitchenette. 
DANIEL (to Zero) When we get back to Paris I'll take you dancing. 
Zero smiles. Sami enters carrying a shopping bag.      He places it on the counter. 
DANIEL Bring me the scissors. 
ZERO And the Vodka. 
Sami removes the items from the bag. He opens the bottle and hands it to Zero who quickly gulps down a few mouthfuls. 
DANIEL Cut his pants up the leg to the groin. 
ZERO And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one. 
He winks at Sami. 
SAMI What's he joking around for?    He's been shot. 
DANIEL He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it. 
Raymond cuts the pant leg away. Daniel walks over to Marcel who is standing over the gas range. Over the flame is a tire wrench, the metal tip glowing red hot. Sami opens the bag and removes some white bread. 
SAMI Anybody hungry? 
DANIEL What'd you get? 
SAMI Some bread and... 
He removes a can of cheese whiz and sprays the cheese onto the bread. 
SAMI Cheese. 
All the French guys look at him as though he is from another planet. 
DANIEL Cheese?   In a can? 
Sami stuffs his mouth with a big bite. 
SAMI It's good. 
MARCEL God, I want to go home. 
SAMI Hey, you know you can't this in France. 
DANIEL Thank God. 
Daniel uses a towel to pick up the tire wrench and walks over to the bed. Sami and Raymond grimace as they think about what's about to happen. 
DANIEL (to Zero) Ready? 
Zero nods. Daniel takes the bottle of Vodka and pours some over the wound. Zero flinches. Daniel looks at Marcel, then releases the belt. Blood flows from the wound. Marcel presses the hot poker against the wound. Zero grunts, but does not scream. His face contorts violently from the pain. 
INT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- EVENING 
Zammito sits at a table in the back eating an assortment of pasta. DEAN MARTIN "Innamaraia" plays on the stereo. EDDIE, 60's, arthritic, finishes making an espresso. He starts carrying it over to Zammito, moving incredibly slow, shuffling one foot in front of the other. Zammito watches him with strained patience. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" enter. Their faces tell the story. 
ZAMMITO What happened? 
NICKY "THE RAKE" They sort of got away. 
ZAMMITO I see. Well, get back out on the street and find them before I "sort of" kill you. 
JOEY "TWO TONS" But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss. 
ZAMMITO Oh, I'm sorry. 
Zammito scoops up a handful of pasta out of his plate and throws it at him. 
ZAMMITO Had enough? 
Joey "Two Tons" looks down sheepishly, several pieces of pasta are stuck to his face. Zammito walks over to him. 
ZAMMITO Try to get this through that fat, stupid fuckin' head of yours. If Half Tooth Tony finds these guys before we do and Bonanno knows what was in my safe we are all dead. 
They turn around and leave.       Zammito stares after them angrily. 
ZAMMITO Cafones! 
He looks over at Eddie who is only half way to the table. 
ZAMMITO You gonna bring that over here today, or what? 
INT. COTTAGE -- MORNING 
Zero is passed out, a half empty Vodka bottle on the nightstand. The others have been up all night. Raymond is across the table from Sami. 
RAYMOND The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine? 
DANIEL I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery. 
BONANNO (seething) I don't think it will be a mystery much longer. 
DANIEL He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years. 
BONANNO I assume you want something? 
DANIEL We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home. 
BONANNO You want me to help you get out of the country? 
Daniel nods. 
BONANNO And for my help I would get what? 
DANIEL Half the tapes. 
BONANNO And the other half? 
DANIEL I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris. 
BONANNO I only have your word for that. 
DANIEL I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word. 
BONANNO Where are you staying? 
Daniel grins.   He isn't going to tell him. 
BONANNO I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made. 
DANIEL How about if I call you? 
INT. COTTAGE -- MORNING 
Zero and Raymond are sleeping. We hear the shower running in the bathroom. Sami is at the table. The black canvas bag containing the tapes is on the table. Sami removes the identical canvas bag he bought at the store from under the bed and places it on the table. He takes the original and leaves. 
EXT. COZY COURTS -- MORNING 
Sami removes the card Hadley gave him, takes out his cell phone and dials. A taxi pulls up. 
SAMI Same place.    One hour. 
Sami gets in the taxi and it drives away.     A beat.   A moment later another taxi pulls up. Daniel gets out. 
INT. COTTAGE -- MORNING 
Daniel enters to find Zero and Raymond still sleeping. He looks at the black canvas bag on the table. Marcel steps out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel. 
EXT. GRANT PARK -- MORNING 
Hadley is waiting by the statue holding a cardboard box.     Sami walks towards him holding the black canvas bag. 
SAMI What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal? 
AGENT HADLEY Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes? 
Sami holds up the canvas bag. 
SAMI The lamp? 
Hadley opens the cardboard box to reveal the bloody lamp base. Sami hands him the canvas bag. 
AGENT HADLEY Just a second. You must think I'm a real moron. 
Hadley removes a small cassette player from his jacket.    He picks a tape and inserts it into the player. 
ZAMMITO'S VOICE I just came by to tell that "piece of work" you asked for on Johnny Wicks -- It's done. 
BONANNO'S VOICE Good.   How'd he go? 
ZAMMITO'S VOICE Like the crying rat bastard that he was. 
Hadley stops the tape.   He inserts another one. 
ZAMMITO'S VOICE Angelo, we can't lean too hard on this guy. He's a congressman. 
BONANNO'S VOICE I made Peter Dimiano a congressman. We pay him each month to look after our interests. 
Hadley grins.   This is great stuff.   He looks up at Sami. 
AGENT HADLEY Here you go, sport. 
Sami grabs the box and leaves. Hadley starts whistling a tune and walks off the other way. As he reaches the tree line Lamar pops out with two of his friends. All of them have guns. 
LAMAR I'll take the bag. 
AGENT HADLEY You don't think I see through this?     You tell Sami he's dead. 
Music continues. Zammito staggers outside and into the street. He laughs, a nervous laugh at his good fortune. 
JERRY VALE'S VOICE My love, please kiss me... 
Zammito turns around to see ZAMMITO'S POV -- A Lincoln Town car speeding towards him. Through the windshield he can see the smiling face of Half Tooth Tony. The front of the car slams into Zammito, lifting him into the air. He flips head over heals then smashes into the windshield and over the car. He lays in the middle of the street, dead. The Lincoln speeds off down the street. 
JERRY VALE'S VOICE Arrivederci amore kiss me...

DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BASTALDI'S'S WAREHOUSE -- PARIS -- MORNING 
Bastaldi steps outside into the crisp morning air.    He takes a few steps, then stops. 
BASTALDI POV -- across the street, standing side by side are Daniel, Sami, Raymond, Marcel and Zero. They look like a ragged bunch, tired, dirty. We PAN across the faces of each one of them as they stare at Bastaldi. 
A BUS goes by blocking Bastaldi's view of the boys.   When it passes the crew it gone! 
Bastaldi bites his lip nervously.    Bastaldi looks around, but there is no sign of them. 
A DIFFERENT ANGLE We can see the five of them crouched behind a parked car. Marcel peers through the window at Bastaldi who is still trying to figure out where they went. They are all amused with Bastaldi's bewilderment. 
RAYMOND What's he doing? 
MARCEL He's looking around for us. 
ZERO Zero can't stay like this much longer. His leg is hurting. 
Finally, Bastaldi turns around and goes back into his apartment. 
INT. BASTALDI'S WAREHOUSE -- DAY 
Bastaldi is at his desk, nervously tapping his fingers on the surface. The phone rings. He knows who is calling. He stares at the phone for a long moment, then he slowly lifts the receiver. 
BASTALDI Hello? 
DANIEL (V.O.) (in French) It's Daniel. 
BASTALDI (in French) Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big-- 
DANIEL (V.O.) (overlapping; in French) -- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock. 
BASTALDI (in French) A million! I don't have that kind of money. 
DANIEL (V.O.) (in French) Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh. 
BASTALDI (In French) I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back. 
DANIEL (V.O.) (in French) Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes. 
The line goes dead.

Bastaldi drives up.    He gets out carrying a suitcase and nervously walks to the boat.

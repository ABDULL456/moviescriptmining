A beat as she gets lost in the memory. She takes a bite of a french fry. 
ROBERTA God, these are cold. 
BRIAN So you're just gonna wrap presents and wait for him to come back? 
ROBERTA You sound like my mother. 
BRIAN That's not very sexy. 
ROBERTA Are you trying to be sexy or be my friend? 
BRIAN A little of both. 
Roberta smiles, blushing a bit. Brian looks at her, getting an idea. 
BRIAN You know, I know this really cool lady who runs this elementary school -- I wrote a piece on her. It's a public school, but it's alternative -- she might be able to create some kind of gig for you. Let me give her a call. 
ROBERTA Great! 
BRIAN (takes his last bite of sandwich) If she hires you, though, you have to be willing to relocate. 
ROBERTA Where is it? 
EXT. SPANISH HARLEM, NEW YORK CITY - TRAVELLING SHOT - DAY 
A SALSA SONG PLAYS OVER as we see stores with Spanish names and signs; Black and Latino elementary school children walking home from school; some burned-out buildings; Black and Latino teens playing basketball on a cement court; Spanish graffiti on walls; elderly women buying fruit at a produce stand. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL this is the POV of Roberta from the back seat of a cab. The SALSA SONG plays on the cab's radio. Roberta looks scared shitless. 
Suddenly, two YOUNG MEN flash down the middle of the street, dart IN FRONT of the cab and the driver SLAMS on the brakes, jerking Roberta forward. 
TAXI DRIVER Welcome to East Harlem. 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK EAST ELEMENTARY SCHOOL (CPE 1) - EAST HARLEM - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
INT. JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - DAY 
JANET WILLIAMS, a Black woman (40's) with a kind face, sits behind her desk and looks at Roberta's resume. A sign on her desk indicates that she's the DIRECTOR. Also on the desk is a FRAMED PICTURE of Janet, her husband, daughter (14), and son (12). Roberta sits nervously in the chair opposite her. 
JANET (looking at resume) Aside from half a term in a private school -- in Greece -- and a year teaching chorus in Hawaii -- ten years ago -- it doesn't look like you've had any other teaching experience. 
ROBERTA Well, not traditional teaching experience. I've been doing private lessons... 
Janet looks for this on the resume. 
ROBERTA It's not on there... I taught my sons. 
Janet smiles politely. 
JANET I'd like to help you, Mrs. Demetras. Brian spoke highly of you and I told him I'd consider starting a violin class... But without the proper qualifications, and without any experience in an inner city school... 
Roberta nods, defeated. 
JANET I'm very sorry. 
INT. CPE 1 - HALLWAY - DAY 
Roberta stands outside Janet's office, dejectedly watching the children noisily running through the hall. 
INT. AREA OUTSIDE JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY 
Roberta knocks on Janet's door. 
JANET (O.S.) Yes? 
As Roberta opens the door, we see that Nick and Lexi are with her. All three have violins. INSIDE, Janet's in conversation with DENNIS RAUSCH (38), an uptight man with a tie that doesn't match his suit jacket. He's showing Janet a large scheduling chart. 
ROBERTA I'm sorry to interrupt, but I wanted you to meet my sons -- Nick, Lexi... 
They enter. 
INT. JANET'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Janet smiles at the boys, but clearly thinks Roberta's a little off. Roberta holds her hand out to Dennis. 
ROBERTA Roberta Guaspari-Demetras. 
Dennis shakes her hand, regarding her warily. 
JANET This is Dennis Rausch, our music teacher and program coordinator. (beat) Mrs. Demetras, didn't I make things clear yesterday? 
ROBERTA If I could just show you something -- it'll only take a minute. 
Before Janet can answer, Roberta and the kids quickly take out their violins and get into position. Janet and Dennis exchange a look. 
DENNIS Are we having a talent show? I should have brought my tap shoes. 
Roberta ignores the jab, then nods to the boys. The three of them begin an incredibly impressive violin trio, playing an ETUDE in three-part harmony. For the first measures, Janet's still annoyed by the intrusion, but she's quickly won over. Dennis watches impassively. 
Roberta and the boys finish their piece; Janet applauds and Dennis joins in to be polite. The three take bows. A beat. 
The bongo player stands. 
ROBERTA You will be the first student who will NOT be in my violin class. Out! 
The child looks stunned. 
ROBERTA I said OUT! 
With a sheepish expression, he exits. The room is finally quiet -- and Roberta's amazed that something worked. She puffs up a little bit, enjoying the feeling of control. 
ROBERTA Who else would like to be kicked out of my class? 
The students stare at her, afraid of her now. DE SEAN, a small but tough Black boy, raises his hand. 
ROBERTA Are you raising your hand because you want to be kicked out? 
DE SEAN Yeah. 
ROBERTA Why? 
DE SEAN I don't wanna learn no stupid violin. It's for wimps. 
ROBERTA Who told you that? 
DE SEAN I just know. 
ROBERTA What's your name? 
BOY De Sean. 
ROBERTA Well, De Sean -- you haven't given me a good enough reason, so you're staying. 
She looks around the room. 
ROBERTA Anyone else? 
Silence. 
INT. MUSIC ROOM - LATER 
In front of the class, Roberta helps NAEEM, a graceful Black boy, hold the violin. He has a serious expression and a scar on his left cheek. Roberta controls the bow and fingerboard, but it appears that the boy is playing music. He smiles. 
NAEEM Hey, I play pretty good. 
Roberta laughs. 
ROBERTA (to Naeem) See how easy it is? (to the class) Maybe in the spring, we could have a big concert for your families and for the whole school. (to the boy) What's your name? 
NAEEM Naeem. 
Roberta writes in a notebook and we see that she's measuring for violin sizes. 
ROBERTA (to class) If you listen to me and do exactly what I say, you're gonna sound beautiful at the concert and you're gonna be so proud of yourselves. (to Naeem) Good, Naeem. Your hand's staying soft. (to the class) But if you don't listen to me, you'll sound so bad that your own parents will feel sick when they hear you. They might even throw up. 
ON THE KIDS, not used to a teacher speaking like that. 
INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
A funky apartment on the Upper West Side. Nick and Lexi are both asleep in sleeping bags on top of a futon on the floor, their suitcases nearby. Brian tiptoes past them, carrying two glasses of champagne. He knocks on his office door. 
ROBERTA (O.S.) Come in. 
INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Roberta's in a bathrobe and nightgown, some rollers in her hair. She's tidying up her suitcase, etc., next to an old couch that's been made up as a bed. Leftist political books line a shelf above Brian's desk, including copies of his own, TO HELL AND BACK: INTERVIEWS WITH VIETNAM VETS by BRIAN TURNER. His desk is covered with files and books pertaining to MIGRANT WORKERS. Brian enters. 
ROBERTA (referring to champagne) What's this? 
BRIAN It's a toast. (giving her a glass, holding his up) To Roberta, who's made it through her first week. 
They clink glasses and drink. 
ROBERTA I don't know, Brian. I'm hanging on by a thread there. Out of fifty kids, maybe six are listening to me. 
BRIAN Look at the progress. Didn't you say no one was listening to you on Monday? 
Roberta laughs. 
ROBERTA I really appreciate all you've done for us. And I promise -- this weekend I'll start looking for a place. 
BRIAN There's no rush. 
ROBERTA No, we've put you out enough. You're supposed to be writing, not babysitting for us. (crosses to his desk, flips through his Vietnam book) I've started your book. It's very powerful. 
BRIAN Thank you. 
Brian comes up behind her and starts to kiss her neck. Roberta's scared -- so she keeps talking, as if it's not really happening. 
ROBERTA So what made you choose migrant workers for your next book? I mean, how do you know what to write about? 
BRIAN (kissing her neck) I follow my gut, pay attention to what I'm being drawn to... 
ROBERTA How long will you be gone? 
BRIAN Two, three months. 
ROBERTA What? 
INT. BRIAN'S BATHROOM - DAY 
Brian throws toiletries into a plastic bag. Roberta enters. 
ROBERTA I thought... I just thought you were gonna be around. And then last night -- 
He stops what he's doing and looks at her. 
BRIAN Whoa. Roberta -- last night was great but did you think I was gonna marry you in the morning? 
ROBERTA No! Of course not. 
We see in her face that part of her did think that. 
ROBERTA It's just that... we just got here and we're barely... I don't even know where to buy groceries. 
Brian softens as he sees how vulnerable she is. He takes her in his arms. 
BRIAN You're gonna be fine. You have a job, a place to stay, your kids have a school to go to -- and there's a D'Agostino's around the corner. 
She attempts a smile. 
ROBERTA Congratulations. 
He kisses her forehead, then exits. HOLD ON ROBERTA, looking hurt and frightened. 
INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY 
Roberta rosins her bow, standing in front of ten kids -- third through fifth-grade -- who sit on the floor next to their violin cases. The kids are Black and Latino, with a couple of white faces. They're all talking and ignoring Roberta except for NAEEM and GUADALUPE, a petite Mexican girl with a long dark braid. [NOTE: We'll see other violin students from time to time, but this is the class we'll follow for Roberta's first year] 
ROBERTA And what am I doing now? 
NAEEM/GUADALUPE Rosining the bow. 
ROBERTA Good. And what am I doing when I turn this little screw? (raising her voice) Everyone stop talking. Right now! 
The kids quiet down. Only Naeem raises his hand. 
ROBERTA Naeem? 
NAEEM Tightening the horse hair. 
ROBERTA (touches the heel of the bow) And what do we call this? 
Again, only Naeem raises his hand. Roberta sees him but turns to DE SEAN, who's talking to his neighbor. 
ROBERTA De Sean? 
DE SEAN Yeah? 
ROBERTA What do we call this? 
DE SEAN I don't know. 
ROBERTA Why not? 
DE SEAN I wasn't here. 
ROBERTA Yes you were but you weren't paying attention! Do you want people to think you're stupid? 
This makes De Sean blush -- and it pisses him off. 
ROBERTA All right, Naeem -- tell them. 
NAEEM It's called the frog. 
Some kids giggle and joke about this. Roberta points to the scroll of the violin. 
ROBERTA Anyone remember what this is? 
LUCY, the fidgety girl, snaps her fingers. 
ROBERTA Lucy! Do you like people snapping their fingers when you're talking? 
LUCY Yeah! 
The kids laugh. Roberta doesn't. She points to the scroll. 
ROBERTA What is this called? 
LUCY The jeri curl? 
Roberta laughs, even though she's trying to be tough. 
INT. DENNIS' MUSIC CLASSROOM - DAY 
ROBERTA See how I pushed you? It means your feet aren't centered. 
Guadalupe tries to correct her feet. Roberta bends down to help and sees that the little girl wears LEG BRACES under her pants. Roberta stands and gestures to one of the boys. 
ROBERTA Can you bring over a chair? (to Guadalupe) It's probably better for you to sit. 
The boy brings the chair. Guadalupe sits, embarrassed. 
EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY 
Roberta walks through a school yard filled with kids and parents picking them up. She sees Naeem and crosses to him. 
ROBERTA Where were you today, Naeem? 
NAEEM I can't be in violin class anymore. 
ROBERTA Why not? 
NAEEM My mother won't let me. 
ROBERTA What? 
NAEEM'S MOTHER, MRS. ADISA, steps INTO FRAME. She's an attractive Black woman in a dress and head scarf made of African fabric. 
MRS. ADISA My son's got more important things to do than learn dead white men's music. 
ROBERTA They're gonna learn "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"! 
MRS. ADISA How many Black classical composers can you name? How many Black classical violinists do you know? 
ROBERTA That doesn't mean it's the way it should be. Naeem's learning to play music -- and that makes him feel good about himself. Why should it matter who wrote it? 
NAEEM Please, Mom? Can't I be in the class? 
Mrs. Adisa puts a protective arm around her son, then addresses Roberta. 
MRS. ADISA Look. I've seen this before. You white women come up here and think you can rescue our poor inner city children who never asked to be rescued in the first place. No thank you. 
She walks off with Naeem. He glances back at Roberta, then turns away quickly. Roberta watches after them. 
INT. BRIAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Roberta attempts to read Brian's book, To Hell and Back: Interviews with Vietnam Vets, but she's distracted. She glances at her purse, then back to the book. She puts the book down and dials the phone. 
ROBERTA Brian Turner's room, please. 
While she waits, she looks at Brian's picture on the book jacket. There's no answer and she hangs up. She starts to straighten the already clean room, then gets her purse, takes out her wallet, and opens it to the plastic covered pictures. 
INSERT - PICTURES 
Charles in uniform; a studio shot of the boys when they were 3 and 1; the whole family posed on the terrace of their home in Greece, a view of the ocean behind them. 
BACK TO ROBERTA 
She's really depressed herself now. 
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
ALICE CROWLEY (50's), a no-nonsense Black teacher, shows her fifth-graders a globe. She doesn't turn as Roberta enters and crosses to her. In the b.g. we see ROBERTA'S STUDENTS waiting in THE HALL. 
ALICE And which ocean is this? 
Kids simultaneously yell out "ATLANTIC" and "PACIFIC." 
ROBERTA Excuse me... I'm here for the violin students. 
ALICE (icy) You're late. 
ROBERTA Just a couple of minutes -- I'm sorry. 
ALICE They're having a lesson now. 
ROBERTA But this is when they have violin class! 
ALICE That's not my problem. 
Roberta's reluctant to argue in front of the kids; she exits. 
EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY 
Lots of noise and chaos as kids run wild during lunch recess. Janet rushes through the throngs while Roberta tries to keep up. 
ROBERTA I thought all the teachers agreed to this. 
JANET In theory. (to a student) Adam! I want you in my office right after lunch, you understand? 
ADAM What'd I do? 
JANET Think about it! (to Roberta) Whenever you pull kids out, it's a disruption, plus it's extra work for the teacher 'cause they have to fill the kids in on what they missed. Some teachers resent it. 
ROBERTA Well, can't you talk to them? 
ROBERTA I never said that. 
BRIAN No? Maybe not with words. 
This embarrasses her, then pisses her off. 
ROBERTA You know what? I shouldn't have called you. This was a mistake. 
BRIAN No, no -- I'm sorry. Look, I know it hurts, but you're gonna get through this, Roberta -- you will. 
ROBERTA I'm moving back to my Mom's. 
BRIAN What? You're gonna quit teaching in the middle of the term? 
ROBERTA I don't fit in there -- I'm not making any progress with the kids... 
BRIAN What are you gonna tell Janet -- your husband left you and nothing else matters? 
ROBERTA I don't know yet. 
INT. BRIAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Roberta lies awake on the futon, heartbroken. 
INT. BRIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Roberta stands and watches Nick and Lexi sleep. She lies down beside them and closes her eyes. 
INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 
Roberta walks through crowds of kids towards Janet who's in the middle of confronting a boy student. Janet holds a FIFTY- DOLLAR BILL. Roberta hangs back and waits for a chance to speak. 
BOY My mother gave it to me. 
JANET Why would she give you fifty dollars? 
BOY To buy breakfast. 
Janet gives him a stern look. 
JANET Do you know how hard your mother works? Do you think it's right for you steal from her? 
BOY I didn't! 
JANET Well let's go call her right now and ask her. 
As Janet turns to walk off, Roberta crosses to her. 
ROBERTA I need to speak to you. It's important. 
JANET It'll have to wait. (to the boy) Come on. In my office. 
Roberta watches as Janet dashes off with the boy in tow. 
INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY 
Guadalupe sits on a chair in the empty room, struggling to set up her violin. Roberta enters, surprised to see her. 
ROBERTA Guadalupe? What are you doing here? 
GUADALUPE I can't get the stop sign. 
ROBERTA Honey, your teacher's probably looking for you. 
Guadalupe sighs, then hands Roberta the violin. 
GUADALUPE I can't come anymore. It's too hard. 
ROBERTA The violin is hard for everyone. 
GUADALUPE But everyone else is better than me. I'll always be slow. 
Roberta looks at her sadly and puts the violin in its case. 
ROBERTA Did you ever hear of Itzhak Perlman? 
GUADALUPE No. 
ROBERTA He's one of the greatest violinists in the world, and he has problems with his legs too. He walks with two canes -- but he still makes the most beautiful music. 
GUADALUPE And he sits down when he plays? 
ROBERTA He has to. 
Guadalupe takes this in. 
GUADALUPE He was your student? 
Roberta laughs. 
ROBERTA No. But if he was, I'd tell him the same thing I'm telling you. You shouldn't quit something just because it's hard. 
NICK And the octopuses. 
Roberta smiles and puts her arm around him. 
NICK Is Daddy coming here soon? 
Roberta tenses up. 
ROBERTA Well, that's something I've been wanting to talk to you about. Daddy's not gonna live with us anymore. You and Lexi will have special times when you stay with him, like at Christmas. 
A beat. 
NICK Can you tell the birthday story? 
Roberta looks at him, concerned that he's not responding to her news. 
ROBERTA Don't you want to talk about what I told you? 
NICK I want to hear the birthday story. 
A beat as she contemplates whether to push or not, then: 
ROBERTA It was the day of Grandpa's birthday, and I was sad because he had died a few months back. 
NICK But you knew I'd be born that day. 
ROBERTA So I packed a bag and got all ready -- 
NICK And Daddy laughed. 
ROBERTA I said, "It's my father's birthday, and the baby's gonna be born today." 
NICK He didn't believe you. But I was born. The same day as Grandpa. 
ROBERTA It was a happy day. 
NICK Was Daddy happy too? 
She looks at him, taken aback by the question. 
ROBERTA Of course he was. 
NICK Then why is he leaving me? 
Roberta, overcome with emotion, can barely answer. 
ROBERTA He's not leaving you, Nick. He loves you and Lexi very much. 
NICK Then why can't he live here? 
ROBERTA (struggling) It's very hard to explain... Sometimes things happen between grown-ups... and they just can't be together. 
The CAMERA moves behind them as they continue to look out the window, and we see Nick move away from his mother. 
INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY 
The kids play "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" and they sound awful. Roberta looks disgusted as she leads them. 
ROBERTA Slow bows! Slow bows! Don't squeeze! Stop! Everybody stop! (to De Sean) How much did you practice this week? 
DE SEAN My asthma -- it was very bad and I had to go to the hospital. 
ROBERTA Again? You told me you went to the hospital last week. 
DE SEAN Oh yeah. Maybe it was last week. 
Roberta rolls her eyes, then turns to Lucy. 
ROBERTA Lucy -- you sounded the worst of all. Have you practiced? 
LUCY No. 
ROBERTA Why not? You can't be in this class if you don't practice! 
LUCY My grandma got mugged. 
A beat. 
ROBERTA Oh. I'm sorry. Is she O.K.? 
LUCY She died. 
Roberta stands there, sobered. 
ROBERTA I'm really sorry, Lucy. (tries to get her bearings) Just do the best you can. 
EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY 
A group of kids stand together with their violins and chat. Roberta exits the building and they greet her. She waves back, but she's clearly still upset by her interaction with Lucy. She sees Naeem and his mother and approaches them. 
NAEEM Hi, Roberta. 
MRS. LAMB You're shouting at them. All the time. 
ROBERTA Not all the time. But if they don't listen -- 
MRS. LAMB Didn't you tell them that they were making their parents sick? 
Janet raises her eyebrows at this. 
ROBERTA That wasn't exactly what I said -- 
MRS. LAMB I'm raising Becky in a supportive atmosphere. I don't send her to school to be abused. 
ROBERTA I'm just trying to discipline them. If they're gonna learn an instrument, they need to take it seriously -- 
JANET I think what Mrs. Lamb is trying to say, Roberta, is that you're a little too harsh. I'm sure you might be able to soften some of your comments to the children? 
She gives Roberta a long hard look. Roberta nods. 
INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY 
Roberta listens to the students play "Go Tell Aunt Rhody" -- badly. They finish and stare at her, afraid of her response. 
ROBERTA Well, that was... that was pretty good... that wasn't too bad... 
They look at her in disbelief, then look at each other. 
DE SEAN It wasn't? I thought we stunk. 
ROBERTA I wouldn't put it that way... You all just need to practice a bit more. (to James) James, have you practiced this week? 
The boy nervously shakes his head no. 
ROBERTA Can you please try a little harder for next week? 
James nods. The kids are baffled by her politeness. 
ROBERTA Good. Just do the best you can. 
DE SEAN Why you acting like that? 
ROBERTA Like what? 
DE SEAN Nice. 
ROBERTA Don't you want a nice teacher? 
DE SEAN I already got nice teachers. You added some variety. 
LUCY Yeah. We like you better the way you used to be. 
ROBERTA Oh. (to Becky) What about you, Becky? 
BECKY Yeah. This is even worse. You're acting weird now. 
A beat. 
ROBERTA Well, then -- I take it back. You all stunk. 
The kids laugh. 
ROBERTA But don't tell your parents I said so! 
The kids laugh again. 
INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DEPARTURE GATE - DAY 
Christmas MUZAK plays in the b.g. as Roberta kisses and hugs Lexi and Nick goodbye. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT stands nearby. 
LEXI Can't you come with us? Please? 
ROBERTA Honey, I told you. This is Daddy's special time with you. 
Lexi looks upset; Nick is stoic. Roberta hugs them one last time. The FLIGHT ATTENDANT steps forward. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT I'll take good care of them. 
The FLIGHT ATTENDANT escorts them into the jet way. Roberta holds back tears as they get further away from her. At the last moment, Lexi turns and waves; Nick does not. Roberta waves, tears starting to fall, and the boys disappear from sight. She observes all the families travelling together, and feels like the loneliest person in the airport. 
INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Roberta enters her apartment, back from the airport, and double-locks the door behind her. You can see on her face that she's dreading the emptiness. She crosses to a small Christmas tree, obviously decorated by her and the boys, and plugs in the tiny blinking lights. It's not exactly Rockefeller Center. She turns on the T.V., playing IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. 
She crosses to the kitchen, then returns with a carton of eggnog, a glass, and a bottle of rum. She sits down on the couch, pours herself some eggnog, adds rum, adds more rum, goes back into the kitchen, returns with nutmeg, sprinkles some on top, then drinks. She sighs, glancing miserably at the tree and the T.V. Pathetic. She couldn't look any less festive if she tried. There's a KNOCK on the DOOR. 
Roberta gets up and warily approaches the door. 
ROBERTA Who is it? 
BRIAN (O.S.) Santa Claus. 
She looks through the peephole, then quickly unlocks the door and opens it, revealing BRIAN, giving her a big smile. 
She starts for the door and the kids moan and groan: "Come on, Roberta!" "Roberta, get back here!" She smiles. 
ROBERTA Well, O.K. But you have to promise you'll all start together. 
She nods. They begin again -- all at different times. 
DE SEAN Man. We'll never get that right. 
ROBERTA That's not a very nice thing to say about your classmates. (to class) How many people think they can get it right by the concert? 
All the kids raise their hands. De Sean looks around, embarrassed, then raises his too. Roberta smiles. 
INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Brian and Roberta finish making love on the futon. They lie in each other's arms, still breathing heavily. 
ROBERTA I love you. 
Brian makes a sound that's either panting or laughing. 
ROBERTA Did you just laugh? 
BRIAN I'm sorry. It's just... 
Roberta looks at him, offended. 
ROBERTA What? 
BRIAN Why do people feel like the minute something's going great, they gotta name it? (beat) Once you name something, you snuff the life out of it. 
She disentangles from him. 
ROBERTA Jesus, Brian. Do you still get away with that crap? It's not the Sixties anymore. 
BRIAN Well, maybe if you'd actually gone through the Sixties, you'd know what I'm talking about. 
ROBERTA Fine! We won't name it, we won't talk about it, we'll act like we have no feelings for each other whatsoever! 
She angrily turns on her side with her back to him. Brian regrets hurting her and moves to her, kissing her shoulder. 
BRIAN I'm sorry. I'm being an asshole. (sweetly teasing) You can say you love me if you want. 
ROBERTA Forget it. I changed my mind. 
He laughs and coaxes her to kiss him -- a temporary truce. 
INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY 
ERNIE (70's), a rickety Black man in work boots, looks baffled by a tangled mess of wires protruding from a wall. Roberta approaches. 
ROBERTA How's it coming, Ernie? 
ERNIE Well, if I could just remember what I did here yesterday, I'd be moving a whole lot faster. (beat) You look real pretty today, honey. 
Brian overhears, rolls his eyes and pulls her aside. 
BRIAN You're crazy. Why did you hire him? 
ROBERTA He needed a job. Besides, he's wired all of East Harlem. 
BRIAN When? Fifty years ago? 
Brian sighs and walks off into another room. Two MEN carry in large panels of sheetrock with old WALLPAPER on it. 
ROBERTA Why is there wallpaper on it? 
MAN #1 That's how it comes. 
They lean the panels against a wall. Roberta turns to Ernie. 
ERNIE Yep, that's how it comes now. 
The guys quickly exit. Brian re-enters and sees the panels. 
BRIAN What the hell is this? 
ROBERTA Sheetrock. 
BRIAN You've gotta be kidding. Those ex- cons you hired ripped this off -- and you too! 
Roberta feels stupid but doesn't want to show it. 
ROBERTA Look -- this house is taking every penny of my settlement. I can't afford fancy union workers! 
BRIAN (throwing up his hands) Fine. Do it your way. 
He stomps off. ANOTHER ANGLE - Nick watches them fight and looks distressed. 
EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY 
Lots of screaming and commotion as the kids crowd around a fight in progress. As we move through the crowd we see that NICK's in a fight with another boy; Nick's nose is bleeding and he has the boy in a headlock. TWO TEACHERS run over to break it up. 
EXT. CPE 1 - DAY - ESTABLISHING - TIME CUT (1998) 
The side of the building now has an impressive mural: an urban landscape with three super heroes -- Puerto Rican, Black, and white -- rising up out of the street. It reads ONLY THE STRONG SHALL SURVIVE. 
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
Roberta stands in front of a classroom of twenty cute first- graders -- mostly Black and Latino, a few white -- sitting on the floor, chatting excitedly. Even though Roberta's ten years older, she seems more youthful; her wavy hair is loose over her shoulders, her clothing's casual and artistic. Beside her is Janet, her hair flecked with gray, and Dennis, who looks pretty much the same. The classroom teacher is ISABEL, a little older, a little tougher. 
ISABEL C'mon everybody, settle down -- Janet wants to talk to you. 
JANET Today's a very special day because we're starting the tenth year of the East Harlem Violin Program. This is a wonderful opportunity for you, so I want you to talk to your parents about whether you'd like to try this. 
ISABEL My daughter took violin with Roberta when she was your age, and now she's in high school and she still talks about how much she loved it. 
DENNIS Janet and I started this program because we knew how much you kids could benefit from it. 
CUTAWAY to Roberta and Janet exchanging glances over Dennis taking credit for the program. 
DENNIS You should know, however, that the violin is a difficult instrument. 
JUSTIN, a Black boy with attitude, raises his hand. He always wears a puffy red, yellow and green crocheted beret. Isabel nods to him. 
JUSTIN Who's that lady in the back? 
ANGLE - DOROTHEA (Doro-taya) VAN HAUFTEN (40's), an elegant, beautiful woman, smartly dressed, takes photographs from the back of the room. 
JANET That's Dorothea Van Hauften -- 
JUSTIN Say what? What kinda name is that? 
ISABEL Justin -- sshh! 
JANET -- and she's taking pictures of Roberta's classes for a magazine article about music education. 
JUSTIN I wanna be in the magazine! 
ISABEL First things first, Justin. Roberta's gonna explain to you about the "lottery." 
Roberta steps forward. RAMON OLIVAS (7), a small, adorable Puerto Rican boy with a crew cut, watches her with adoration. 
ROBERTA I used to just teach fifty kids at this school. But now I teach a hundred and fifty kids at three East Harlem schools and there's so many children who want to take violin classes that we have to have a lottery. 
VANESSA raises her hand, a white girl whose clothes and accessories are always adorned with cats. 
VANESSA Can I be in the class? 
ISABEL Roberta's explaining that. Just listen. 
ROBERTA After your parents sign your permission slips, I'm gonna put them in a sack, and I'll pick fifty names from each school. 
ANGLE - Ramon listens intently with his fingers crossed. 
ROBERTA So everyone bring in your slips by Friday, and I'll come back and tell you who's in violin class. 
ISABEL Remember, she's just picking names from a hat. It doesn't mean that anyone's better than anyone else. 
RAMON raises his hand. 
RAMON (to Roberta) I really really hope that I get in the class. 
Roberta looks at him, struck by his sweetness. 
ROBERTA I hope so too. 
EXT. 118TH STREET - STREET SIGN - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
EXT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - DAY 
The brownstone looks a lot better than when we last saw it. Graffiti's been removed, the stairs have been repaired, the windows have security bars, and there are flowers blooming in pots in front of the building. Roberta steps INTO FRAME, walking Allegra, now a 10-year-old dog. 
INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY 
The house is transformed: the first floor is one long open room with oak floors, a living room in front with a beautiful fireplace and a grand piano, and a country kitchen in the rear, complete with pots hanging over a large butcher block. 
NICK (17) practices cello and LEXI (15) practices piano; they play Haydn's "Trio #13." Now handsome young men, their blonde hair has darkened to brown. Nick is huskier; Lexi has a slighter build. Both are passionate, talented musicians. 
On the couch, RACHEL (12), a mature, beautiful Black girl, rosins her bow. 
RACHEL How come you guys don't play the violin? 
LEXI Well, picture her being your teacher and your mother. 
Rachel cracks up but stifles her laughter as Roberta enters from outside with Allegra. 
ROBERTA Hi Rachel. Be right with you. 
As Roberta removes Allegra's leash, Rachel and Lexi share a conspiratorial look. In the b.g., Nick packs up his cello. 
ROBERTA (to Nick) You're gonna practice upstairs? 
NICK No. I'm done. 
EXT. HOUSING PROJECT - NIGHT 
Not a place you'd want to go into, even in the day time. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL this is their POV from INSIDE THE CAR. The boys look frightened, but Roberta's on a mission. 
NICK C'mon Mom, let's get out of here. 
ROBERTA Lock the doors. 
And she exits. The boys watch as she heads for the building, then Lexi shakes his head and covers his face. 
LEXI I'm dead. She's gonna get me killed. 
Nick jumps out of the car and heads after her. 
NICK I'm coming with you! 
ROBERTA No. Get back in the car and stay with the boys. 
Nick hesitates and heads back. Roberta presses on. Lawrence opens the window and calls to her. 
LAWRENCE Don't take the stairs! 
INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON THE ELEVATOR DOOR with a handwritten SIGN that reads OUT OF ORDER. 
WIDER - Roberta stands in front of the elevator, staring tensely at the sign. She takes a deep breath, then heads for the staircase. 
INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - NIGHT 
Roberta climbs the dimly-lit stairs of a dilapidated, scary building. O.S. a BABY CRIES, a couple of TV's BLARE. 
INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
At the top of the stairs, Roberta turns down the hall, passing a door riddled with bullet holes. She finds the apartment and knocks. No response. She knocks again. 
OLD WOMAN (O.S.) Yeah? 
ROBERTA I'm a school teacher. Henry has taken my son's bicycle and I want it back. 
A beat, then the door cracks open, an OLD WOMAN visible through the chain lock. 
OLD WOMAN Henry's not here. 
ROBERTA Well you tell Henry that if he returns the bike, I won't have to notify the police -- or his school principal. Although since I am a teacher, it would be very easy for me to do that. 
A couple of beats. 
OLD WOMAN He's not home. He doesn't get home till late. 
ROBERTA How late? 
OLD WOMAN Not till after ten. 
ROBERTA I'll be on the steps of CPE 1 at 11 P.M. I'll be waiting for him. 
The door closes. Roberta exhales. Did she just do that? 
EXT. CPE 1 - NIGHT 
Roberta, Nick, Lexi and Lawrence sit on the front steps of the school. The street is deserted. 
LEXI You're crazy. He's not gonna show. 
Roberta sits confidently. 
NICK You think he actually cares that you're a teacher? You think he even goes to school? 
LEXI C'mon, Mom -- let's just go. 
ROBERTA It's only five after eleven. 
Nick and Lexi roll their eyes and exchange a look: she's nuts. Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a bicycle. Nick, Lexi and Lawrence look towards the sound, incredulous. Lexi stands. 
Henry rides up on the bike and dismounts. Lexi looks directly at him as he takes the bike from him. 
HENRY I was just borrowing it. 
He glances at Roberta, then walks off. 
INT. CPE 1 - CLASSROOM - DAY 
Roberta stands in front of Isabel's class and calls out names, handing the selected children acceptance letters. The kids are charged up; "My heart is pounding!" "Please pick me!" 
ROBERTA Shandra Wilson. 
A pretty Black girl with braids and tons of barrettes jumps up and down, then runs up for her letter. The kids SQUEAL and CHEER for each student called. Shandra hugs her best friend MYESHA, a chubby Black girl who also holds a letter. 
ROBERTA Justin Brady. 
INT. RIVER EAST SCHOOL - MUSIC ROOM - DAY 
Roberta's advanced class plays "Can-Can." Rachel's one of the eight sixth-graders. Roberta plays along, crossing to AMANDA, a white girl in a country-western outfit. 
ROBERTA Amanda, what did I tell you about wearing cowboy boots to violin class? They're too slippery! 
She crosses to a pudgy Black/Puerto Rican boy with glasses. 
ROBERTA Relax your two, Simon... 
She glances at STEPHANIE, a white girl with red hair, next to KENNY, a Black boy with an earnest expression. 
ROBERTA Your stop sign has to be up, Kenny! Stephanie, it doesn't look like you ever had a lesson with me! 
CARLOS (13) hurries in, a handsome Black boy in a baseball jacket that says "LOS LEONES." He looks 15. 
ROBERTA Where's your violin, Carlos? 
CARLOS It's coming. 
He nervously looks down the hall. 
ROBERTA What, is it walking here by itself? 
A Black third-grade girl rushes into the room and hands Carlos his violin, then runs off. Roberta crosses to Carlos as he quickly readies the violin. 
ROBERTA Your buddies giving you a hard time? 
CARLOS Look, it's just not cool. You wouldn't understand. 
ROBERTA Hey, you want your sister to carry your violin, that's fine. But is she practicing for you too? Because lately, that's how it sounds. 
CARLOS I've been busy! I've been -- 
ROBERTA I'm not interested! Just get here on time, and commit to this class or I don't want you in here, you understand? 
He nods sullenly. 
ROBERTA You're a good violinist, Carlos -- and it's definitely not "cool" to waste your own talent. 
Carlos takes this in as Roberta crosses to another student. 
EXT. RAMON'S APARTMENT - EAST HARLEM - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT 
It's upstairs from a grocery store on a busy street. 
INT. RAMON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Ramon sits on the floor, upset, half-heartedly building with Legos, while his parents argue in the KITCHEN. His father MANUELO is a stocky, muscular man. INTERCUT between the two areas. This is a modest, well-kept apartment. Off the kitchen, religious candles burn on a shelf above a washing machine. 
MANUELO Why didn't you show it to me? 
CONCEPCION It just needed one parent's signature. 
MANUELO (with some Spanish) Well, I'm his parent and I don't give permission! He should be playing baseball, not the violin! 
CONCEPCION It makes him happy. 
ON RAMON, looking far from happy at the moment. 
EXT. RIVER EAST SCHOOL - DAY 
Rachel steps off a city bus, carrying her violin. She passes two sixth-grade boys and a girl. 
BOY #1 (loudly) Ooh, check out little Miss Violinhead. 
GIRL She carry that violin with her all the time 'cause she think she special. 
Rachel turns to them. 
RACHEL I am special. 
She proudly continues on, then sees Roberta walking towards the school and catches up to her. 
RACHEL (nonchalant) So I heard from Julliard. 
Roberta stops and looks at her. 
ROBERTA And? 
RACHEL They said yes! 
Roberta gives her a big hug. 
INT. CPE 1 - MUSIC ROOM - DAY 
ON THE BEGINNER'S CLASS, including Ramon, as they play "Lightly Row." Roberta walks around, making corrections as she addresses the students. She doesn't see Justin poking Ramon with his bow; Ramon swats the bow away and glares at his nemesis. Roberta moves some of Shandra's braids away from the violin. 
ROBERTA So when you take the violins home, tape your music to the wall directly in front of your nose so you can play with perfect posture. Your parents are gonna be so excited to hear you play! 
INT. RAMON'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
ROBERTA (to Isabel) What happened? 
INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY 
The beginners sit on the floor and rosin their bows. A few chat, but it's quieter than usual, except for RAMON who is "blessing" kids with his violin bow. 
RAMON You go to heaven... You go to hell... You go to hell... heaven... 
Roberta enters slowly. She looks very shaken up. She takes note of what Ramon is doing, and overhears Toussaint and Shandra in mid-conversation. 
TOUSSAINT My grandpa died and my uncle, so that makes six. 
SHANDRA I know more than that. At least seven people... maybe even nine. 
Roberta gently tells Ramon to sit, and then she sits down on a child-sized chair in front of them. 
ROBERTA (quietly) I know that you've all heard the bad news about Justin. 
MYESHA I didn't hear. 
TOUSSAINT There was a drive-by shooting by his house and he got shot on accident and he died. 
Myesha takes this in, looking sad. 
ROBERTA Does anyone want to talk about it? 
RAMON (angry) I think we should just play violin. 
Roberta watches him. 
INT. RAMON'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN AREA - DAY 
Concepcion cooks chicken and Pedro sets the table, whistling along to Ramon's O.S. violin playing "We Shall Overcome." There's a KNOCK on the door. Concepcion answers it, revealing Roberta. 
CONCEPCION Roberta! Come in. 
Roberta enters. 
ROBERTA I came by to check on Ramon. 
CONCEPCION (confused) Why? 
ROBERTA Didn't he tell you what happened at school? 
Concepcion shakes her head no. 
INT. RAMON'S ROOM - DAY 
Ramon is still playing violin as Concepcion and Roberta enter. When he sees Roberta he straightens up even more. 
CONCEPCION Roberta wants to talk to you, O.K.? 
He nods. Concepcion touches his head, then exits. 
RAMON Did that sound O.K.? 
ROBERTA Yeah, it did. 
Ramon smiles, pleased with himself. 
ROBERTA I've been thinking about Justin. Remember how mad I got the last time I saw him? 
RAMON Yeah. You got very strict with him. 
ROBERTA It wasn't always so easy to be nice to him, you know? 
Ramon looks away from her, upset. 
RAMON You think Justin's in heaven or hell? 
ROBERTA Heaven. 
Ramon runs his fingers along his bow. 
RAMON I told him to drop dead. 
Roberta touches Ramon's back. 
ROBERTA Justin didn't die because of what you said. I promise. 
RAMON How do you know? 
ROBERTA I don't think you're that powerful, do you? I mean, if you had such powers, just imagine what kind of violin player you'd be by now! 
RAMON Yeah. I'd be better than you! 
They laugh together, then Ramon looks sad again. 
ROBERTA It's O.K. to cry, you know. 
RAMON Not for a man. 
INT. ROBERTA'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
IN THE MIRROR - Roberta takes a last look at herself, wondering if he'll find her attractive. She touches her hair, adjusts her dress, then takes a deep breath as she builds up her courage. 
INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Roberta enters the living room where Dan is chatting with Nick and Lexi. Dan sees her and is instantly smitten. 
DAN (shaking her hand) Wow. An honest woman. 
ROBERTA Honest? 
DAN Your ad. When you said you were beautiful, you were telling the truth. 
She smiles, blushing, and avoids eye contact with her sons who are trying really hard not to laugh. As she and Dan start to exit: 
NICK Make sure you're home by midnight, young lady. 
INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON CLOCK 
It reads 12:30. 
WIDER - Nick and Lexi play a video game on the TV screen. O.S., there's the SOUND OF A CAR. They race to the window. 
LEXI Ten bucks he tries to kiss her. 
NICK That's a no-brainer. Of course he'll try. The real question is whether she'll let him. 
LEXI O.K. -- ten bucks she lets him. 
NICK You're on. 
They stare out the window intently. 
INT. DAN'S CAR - NIGHT 
Dan pulls his car up in front of Roberta's house. Beside him, Roberta holds a program from a Lincoln Center concert. Roberta's tense, but Dan seems relaxed and centered in his attraction to her. 
DAN I had a lot of fun tonight. 
ROBERTA Yeah, I did too. 
DAN I have a confession -- I've never answered an ad before. I did it on a dare. 
ROBERTA Well, I have a confession -- my boys placed the ad behind my back. 
They both laugh, then smile at each other. An awkward beat: will he or won't he? Dan leans in to kiss her, and Roberta turns away, uncertain. 
ROBERTA Look, Dan -- I went along with this 'cause it's been a while. Quite a while... And I had a very nice time... but I'm not sure if I'm ready to get involved with anyone right now. 
A beat. Roberta feels badly about rejecting him. 
DAN (deadpan) Does this mean I don't get any lasagna? 
Roberta cracks up. Dan smiles at her. 
INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT 
Roberta enters. The boys are back to their video game, covering that they've been spying on her. 
ROBERTA Why are you guys still up? 
NICK (all innocence) Why? Is it late? 
ROBERTA Good try, Nick. 
LEXI So how was it? 
ROBERTA Well... he's nice. 
NICK "Nice"? As in "let's just be friends" nice? 
ROBERTA I don't know yet. We'll see. 
Nick looks disappointed. 
NICK There's still a lot more letters. 
ROBERTA Good night, Nick. 
She starts heading upstairs. 
LEXI Hey, Mom -- can you loan me ten dollars? 
INT. CPE 1 - MUSIC ROOM - DAY 
THE BLACKBOARD reads: SPRING CONCERT IN 10 DAYS! PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE! 
Roberta rushes in, frazzled, not noticing at first that the beginners are very quiet -- and that most don't have violins. 
ROBERTA Tell that to the Board of Education. 
NICK Let me ask you something. Why did you risk your life for a bicycle? 
Roberta and Lexi look at Nick, baffled as to the relevance of the question. 
ROBERTA I did not risk my life. 
NICK Of course you did! That building? Threatening Henry? And for what -- two hundred dollars? 
ROBERTA No. Not for that. 
LEXI Then why? 
ROBERTA When someone steals something that belongs to my kids, I'm not gonna sit back and let that happen! 
A beat as she realizes what she's just said. The boys look at her and the three of them stop walking. 
ROBERTA Guys -- you need to think about this. If I try to fight this -- with no salary coming in -- I could lose the house, screw up your college plans... It would be a lot safer to just go out tomorrow and get a job in a private school. 
LEXI Yeah, but is that where you really want to be? 
INT. ROBERTA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Roberta frantically searches through her purse, then crosses to a hall closet and quickly checks the pockets of her coats and jackets. 
She feels inside a jacket pocket, then finds it: DOROTHEA'S BUSINESS CARD. 
EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
INT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DEPT. OF JOURNALISM - DAY 
FOLLOW DAN PAXTON as he walks down the hall towards his office and sees a strange silver object on the floor in front of his office door. He picks it up. 
INSERT 
-- A foil-covered plate with a note on top: DO YOU KNOW ANYONE AT THE NEW YORK TIMES? 
BACK TO SCENE 
Dan lifts up the foil to reveal a large piece of LASAGNA. 
INT. CPE 1 AUDITORIUM - THE CONCERT - STAGE - NIGHT 
SEVENTY-FIVE KIDS play "We Shall Overcome" and it's incredibly moving. Nick's on cello, Lexi plays piano. ROBERTA proudly leads the children. At the side of the stage, we see DOROTHEA photographing the concert. THE CAMERA PANS THE AUDIENCE of teary-eyed parents, many of them with CAM CORDERS. We FIND Ramon's family. Manuelo is riverted by his son's playing, and he starts to cry. Concepcion knows this without looking. She takes his hand. 
ANGLE - JANET stands along the side and her eyes start to fill with tears. She tries to stay composed, then discreetly exits the auditorium. 
The song ends and the audience APPLAUDS, rising from their seats, including ASSUNTA (now 65), next to ISABEL and DAN. Someone remains seated: a REPORTER (40's), sitting beside Dan and taking notes. 
The STUDENTS bow, then point to Roberta who bows and takes the stage. She gestures for people to sit. A beginner student brings her flowers. Roberta kisses her, then approaches the mike. 
ROBERTA (to the audience) The beautiful concert that you just heard could be the last concert of the East Harlem Violin Program. The Board of Education and the District Superintendent don't think that music is important for our children. But they're wrong -- and they're in for a fight. 
The parents stand and applaud. We see the REPORTER writing quickly. Dorothea snaps more pictures. Roberta extends an arm towards the kids, directing the applause at them. Ramon gives her a thumbs up. 
INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
ROBERTA is vacuuming the living room while Assunta dusts. Extra chairs are set up in the living room in preparation for a meeting. The doorbell RINGS. 
ROBERTA Someone's early. 
FOLLOW ASSUNTA to the DOOR. She opens it, revealing JANET, who's carrying two bags of groceries. Assunta's demeanor instantly cools when she sees her. In the b.g. Roberta sees Janet and turns off the vacuum cleaner. 
JANET Hello, Assunta. How are you? 
ASSUNTA I'd be a lot better if my daughter had a job next year. 
ROBERTA Ma! 
JANET (to Assunta) I would too. 
Janet briskly walks into THE LIVING ROOM, puts the grocery bags down on a table, and begins to take things out of them. Roberta watches her, mystified. 
JANET (to Roberta) Sorry I'm early, but I figured we'd need time to set up. 
Roberta watches Janet for a beat, then addresses Assunta. 
ROBERTA Mama, why don't you take Allegra out for a walk? 
Assunta hesitates for a beat, then gets the dog and exits. Janet continues unpacking the bags as if there's nothing unusual about her being there. Cheeses, crackers, bread, salads, fruit, paper plates, napkins, etc. She sees Roberta's confused expression. 
JANET You are having a meeting here tonight, right? Parents and teachers? 
ROBERTA Well, yes, but ... 
JANET Take it from me. If you want to get parents to help you with something, you have to feed them. 
She holds up two wedges of cheese. 
JANET You have a cutting board for these? 
DENNIS Who authorized this? 
ROBERTA Janet. 
DENNIS Well Janet's not here today and I want these people out of here. 
The kids quiet down and watch them argue. A CAMERA GUY starts shooting the argument and Dennis sees him. 
DENNIS Turn that off, you hear me? 
ROBERTA Why are you doing this? We're not bothering anyone. 
DENNIS You're disrupting school and I want them out of here -- now. 
ROBERTA You still don't get it, do you? I don't care if you hate me, Dennis -- that's your business. But think about the students for once. Every time you interfere, you're not hurting me -- you're hurting them. 
She points to the kids. They're silent, waiting to see if Roberta got through to him. A beat. 
DENNIS Get these people out of here or I'm calling the police. 
ROBERTA Go right ahead, call them. That'll look real good on the eleven o'clock news. 
A beat and he exits. Roberta takes a deep breath, then turns back to the kids who are watching her, impressed. 
RAMON I don't hear no sirens. 
INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
ON THE TV is the news segment: ROBERTA speaks to an unseen interviewer. 
ROBERTA I'm from a blue collar family, and if it weren't for the lessons I got in public school, I never would have learned the violin. 
It CUTS TO Roberta's beginners speaking to the interviewer. 
INTERVIEWER (O.S.) How does it make you feel to lose your violin program? 
SHANDRA It makes us sad! 
RAMON Yeah, like we're never gonna have no more violin lessons -- 
VANESSA And it's bad because... because we love violin class. 
WIDER - REVEAL Roberta, Lexi and Nick watching the TV. 
INT. ARNOLD STEINHARDT AND DOROTHEA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
ON TV - THE SAME NEWS SEGMENT, ANOTHER SOUND BITE 
ROBERTA Yes, I've gotten offers from two private schools, but this is where I want to be. 
DOROTHEA (O.S.) Arnold, these kids need help. 
WIDER - REVEAL a comfortable Upper East Side apartment and DOROTHEA watching T.V. while ARNOLD practices violin. There's FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHY on the walls, signed by Dorothea. 
ARNOLD Didn't we send them a donation? 
DOROTHEA They need something bigger. And you can't just write a check -- you have to get involved. 
ARNOLD Involved how? 
The look on her face tells him it's more than he bargained for. 
ARNOLD Uh-oh. 
INT. SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY 
1. Arnold Steinhardt speaks on the phone. His Roladex is open to the name ITZHAK PERLMAN. In the b.g., Dorothea tensely waits to hear if Itzhak Perlman will say yes. 
2. Parents, Roberta, Nick and Lexi hang "FIDDLEFEST CONCERT" posters around their neighborhood, announcing a concert at THE 92ND STREET Y with ARNOLD STEINHARDT, ITZHAK PERLMAN and STUDENTS FROM THE EAST HARLEM VIOLIN PROGRAM. 
3. Parents -- including Beverly Wilson, Concepcion, Mr. Adams and Carlos' mom and dad -- stuff envelopes with INVITATIONS to "FIDDLEFEST" and accompanying LETTERS and TICKET ORDER FORMS. Roberta and Dorothea open envelopes with filled-out TICKET ORDER FORMS and CHECKS. They stack the checks in a pile, address return envelopes and place FIDDLEFEST TICKETS inside them. 
INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY 
Thirty-three excited kids from Roberta's different classes chat, tune their violins, rosin their bows. The students include Carlos, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, Rachel, Simon, Ramon, Vanessa, and Shandra. Roberta enters the room, full of energy, and addresses them as she heads to the front. 
ROBERTA Listen up, everyone! Quiet down! 
The students give her their attention. 
ROBERTA You are my very best beginner and advanced violin students and I've chosen you to play in Fiddlefest because I trust that you can handle the pressure. It's gonna be a lot of work -- a lot. Right now, we've sold some tickets, but I'm not gonna be back here in the fall if the audience storms out of their seats, demanding a refund! 
She nods to Rachel who starts handing out sheets of music. 
ROBERTA Rachel's gonna be my lieutenant and I expect you to listen to her. 
Ramon looks through his music sheets. 
RAMON Bach's "Minuet One"? 
ROBERTA People are gonna be paying good money for this concert -- we're not just gonna play "Twinkle." (handing out papers) I'm passing out a contract that you and your parents need to sign. 
Rachel shakes her head no, then starts to cry a little. 
RACHEL I'm sorry about Julliard... and the concert. 
She hands Roberta her violin. 
ROBERTA Keep it. Take it with you. 
RACHEL No... I don't want to play anymore. 
ROBERTA What?! You can't give up violin, Rachel -- it's a part of you. A very important part. 
Rachel looks anguished. Roberta moves closer and touches her arm. 
ROBERTA Please honey. Just take it. 
RACHEL I don't want to. 
Roberta looks at her, pained, then hugs her. Rachel quickly kisses Roberta goodbye and exits. Roberta watches her. 
INT. CPE 1 - MUSIC ROOM - A LITTLE LATER 
Roberta leads De Sean, Naeem, Guadalupe, Lucy, Stephanie, Thomas, Carlos, Erica and Nicholas in the Bach Double Concerto. The other kids watch. Roberta's on the edge of hysteria. She signals the players to stop. 
ROBERTA No, no, no! Accent the up bow after the slurred notes and then it'll get you off of those slurred notes! You Double Concerto kids need to be working harder! This is the grand finale of the concert! You're each gonna be sharing a music stand with one of the world's greatest violinists! 
The kids say "the world's greatest violinists" along with her -- they've obviously been hearing this a lot. Roberta glares at them. 
ROBERTA I think we should forget the Bach Double. (to the other kids) And you guys are never gonna get Minuet One. I think we should drop that too. 
VANESSA No! We can do it, Roberta! 
CARLOS And we'll get the Bach Double. We will. 
She stops, takes a breath. 
NAEEM It's gonna be O.K., Roberta. 
ROBERTA (vulnerable) You think? 
All the kids nod. A few beats. 
ROBERTA O.K... (not believing it) It's gonna be O.K. 
She crosses to take a look at her music, and the kids exchange looks that say, "Oh shit. What did we just promise?" 
REHEARSAL MONTAGE - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY 
1. Carlos practices violin against the fence around River East School. In the b. g., his buddies make fun of him.

4. Ramon practices in his living room, his father watching attentively, then helping him lift the violin higher. 
5. Vanessa practices in a crowded school hallway, frustrated as kids keep bumping into her. 
6. Roberta, in her nightgown, practices in front of her refrigerator in the middle of the night. 
INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON) 
Pandemonium. Nick and Lexi, both in tuxes, are doing several tasks at once while Roberta, in a simple black velvet dress and stockinged feet, tries to put on her makeup but keeps poking her head out of the bathroom, giving orders. Allegra BARKS outside the back door. 
ROBERTA Nick -- did you feed Allegra? 
NICK (fixing Lexi's tie) Yes, Mom. 
ROBERTA Lexi, can you make sure the charts are still in my bag? 
LEXI I already checked, Mom. 
ROBERTA (O.S.) Check again, please. And look for my repair kit too. 
ASSUNTA descends the staircase, dressed in a formal dress. She holds a small jewelry box and heads for the bathroom. 
ASSUNTA Bert, which earrings you want? 
Roberta sticks her head out and picks the earrings. Assunta enters the small bathroom to work on her own makeup. 
ROBERTA Nick? Get two more violins. 
NICK You've already got two -- how many emergencies can there be? 
A beat. 
ROBERTA Get three more. And make sure a couple of them are half-size. 
Nick rolls his eyes and runs upstairs while Lexi organizes things by the door: Nick's cello, Roberta's papers, extra violins. Roberta rushes out of the bathroom, adjusting the earrings. She starts compulsively straightening the house. 
ROBERTA Lexi -- can you call about the car again? 
BRIAN Congratulations. 
ROBERTA Thank you... 
BRIAN I knew you'd get here sooner or later. I'm glad I'm here to see it. 
A beat. 
ROBERTA I am too. 
INT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACKSTAGE WINGS AREA - NIGHT 
Guadalupe shyly approaches Itzhak Perlman, her mother behind her, silently encouraging her. 
GUADALUPE Excuse me, Mr. Perlman? 
He turns around. 
GUADALUPE (extends a hand) I'm Guadalupe. I've wanted to meet you for a long time. 
He smiles at her and they shake hands. 
ITZHAK PERLMAN A pleasure to meet you, Guadalupe. 
As Guadalupe introduces him to her mother, CARLOS approaches. 
CARLOS You nervous, Mr. Perlman? 
ITZHAK PERLMAN Should I be? 
CARLOS Us kids are gonna be great -- I don't know about you guys. How much did you practice? 
Itzhak Perlman laughs. 
INT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACK STAGE - NIGHT 
Roberta talks to Janet with a worried expression. 
ROBERTA You called Vanessa's father and mother? 
JANET No answer at either. 
A Carnegie Hall staff person in a suit enters. 
STAFF PERSON Half hour call! It's now half hour call! So pace yourself accordingly. Don't get more than thirty minutes worth of nervous! 
The room electrifies with nerves. 
VANESSA 
rushes into the room with her father. She's out of breath, her stocking has a big run in it, and she's in tears. 
VANESSA They stole the car! 
MR. KLEIN With the violin. 
ROBERTA Oh my God. (calling) Nick, Lexi -- 
NICK Done. 
The boys rush over to the extra violins and look to find the right size. 
VANESSA (crying) And then when we were getting a taxi, I fell down.

JANET When I became the principal of Central Park East Elementary, I envisioned a school where children could fulfill their highest potential, despite the challenges of poverty and racism. Ten years ago, Roberta Guaspari walked into my office because she needed a job, and because she had a vision that any child could learn the violin. We put our dreams together and created the East Harlem Violin Program which has helped more than a thousand students expand their vision of what's possible in their lives. When a program like this is cut, our children's future is compromised. I want to thank you for your support. Enjoy the concert.

1 EXT. CHINATOWN STREET - MORNING 1 
The same crowded Chinatown street where Rand Peltzer first found Gizmo the Mogwai. As LOCALS bustle past, ANGLE FAVORS the stairs to the basement curiosity shop. 
2 INT. MR. WING'S STORE 
MR. WING, the storekeeper who took Gizmo home after the Gremlins' night of carnage, opens the door, beginning his day. As he lights his pipe, he HEARS a commotion upstairs. 
3 EXT. STREET 3 
PEDESTRIANS dodge a long black LIMOUSINE as it pulls up short. ANGLE reveals that most of the stores on the block have closed -- GOING OUT OF BUSINESS signs and boarded-up windows. FORSTER, a sour-faced man in a business suit, gets out of the limo, followed by three beefy MEN, also in suits. The three big men take a big-screen TV VT and a VCR out of the car. INT. MR. WING'S STORE tj. Mr. Wing looks up from ' hers game as the four men sweep into the store. 
Mister Wi Daniel Clamp would like to see you. 
The men quickly set up the big-screen TV set and VCR. One of the men puts in a tape and hits some buttons, and the TV screen fills with the face of DANIEL CLAMP. At a young 40, he's New York's most successful real estate developer. 
CLAMP (ON TV) Good morning, Mister Wing. Let's out through to key issues, okay? I'm prepared to increase my offer substantially. 
(BEAT) Now, Mister Wing, you're attached to your business. I appreciate that. I'm attached to my own business. I develop the biggest buildings in New York, and you sell, ah, little things. Fine. But I'm not just talking about money here. On the big-screen TV, the IMAGE widens to incim a an easel beside Clam , holding an architect's RENDER that shows the grandiose of a huge office building,.. 
4 CONTINUED: 4 
CLAMP (ON TV) (CONT.) Take a look, Mister Wing -- 
(READS) "The Clamp Chinatown Center -- Where Business Gets Oriented." When I put up a building, it's the biggest -- it's the newest -- it's the best. People are going to be killing each other to get into this building -- The soft O.S. TWITTERING of Gizmo is heard from the rear alcove of the store. 
GIZMO (O.S.) Tee vee! 
CLAMP (ON TV) Now,'we've been able to reach an understanding with everyone on the block -- except for you. Let me show you what I willing to do for you -- a s tand and souvenir cone on, right here under the at The foot traffic thrr here is going to make the building look like a ghost town. 
Mr. Wing regards the video image impassively. 
CLAMP (ON TV) (CONT.) Please IF us know when you've made a decision, Mister Wing. You know, I believe that there's always an area of agreement that two people can reach. The Clamp Corporation's LOGO a stylized "C" -- fills the wereen, replacing Clamp's image. 
MR. WING Yes -- a man can always agree with others. It is more difficult to agree with oneself. 
FORSTER Does that mean you -- He's interrupted as Mr. Wing COUGHS -- a rattling spasm that sounds deeply unhealthy. When the coughing subsides, he answers Forster. 
MR. WING I'm sorry. Please tell Mister Clamp that the answer is no. 
FORSTER Keep the TV. As Mr. Wing walks Clamp's men to the door in b.g., HOLD on the TV set -- and a small, furry PAW that reaches into FRAME to change the TV CHANNEL. With the change of stations, the TV screen fills with a SCENE from a Rambo picture. SYLVESTER STALLONE addresses the movie 
CAMERA: 
STALLONE To survive a war... you've got to become war. Then he screws an explosive-filled metal ARROWHEAD onto an arrow, and SHOOTS the arrow from a bow. The arrow hits a HELICOPTER, which bursts into FLAMES. 
GIZMO (0.3.) Neat! 
But as the helicopter starts to burn, Mr. Wing comes back and angrily turns the TV set OFF, addressing the unseen Gizmo. 
MR. WING Television again! Ai-vuh !. An - invention for fools. 
CD As he starts COUGHING again, 
5A INT. LIMO/EXT. CHINATOWN STREET (MOING) - DAY 5A 
Forster and the bodyguards are dri away from Mr. Wing's store. 
BODYGUARD I'm sorry that didn't work out, sir. I thought he'd like the TV. 
FORSTER You hear that cough? The guy must be eighty -- maybe ninety. We can wait. 
A STING of solemn CHINESE MUSIC covers the DISSOLVE TOt 
6 EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING 6 
Seen through distance and morning MIST, a burial ceremony is taking place, to the accompaniment of the continuing MUSIC.

BILLY Yeah we do. It wouldn't feel right, getting married on the money I'm making now. It's bad enough that you got me the job -- 
KATE I didn't get you the job, I just heard about it. Billy, you can get promoted and stuff if you want to, but you have to act like you deserve it. Let people know you're there. 
14 EXT. CLAMP CENTRE 14 
They arrive at the DOORS to the building's lobby. In addition to regular glass doors, there are a couple of REVOLVING DOORS, 
BILLY Want to try the revolving doors today? Before Kate can answer, a WORKER enters one of the revolving doors. The power-assisted door, going too fast, WHOOSHES him inside, and we HEAR -- 
WORKER (O.S.) Aagghhh! 
KATE Uh-uh. They use a regular door instead. 
15 INT. CLAMP CENTRE LOBBY 15 
The ultra-modern, m j ï¿½tal-style lobby includes several retail BUSINESSES, includingï¿½'1"ï¿½sS, ESTAURANTS, a FROZEN YOGURT STAND, a BEAUTY PARLOR, and CLOTH RES. As Billy and Kate enter, they av i6l$ thread their way through several WORKERS sprawled in front othe revolving doors. The workers are getting dizzily to their feet, gathering their spilled briefcases, etc. SPOT bar-codes, like Billy's and Kate's, on the chests of several of the workers. Kate waves hello to a thirtyish WOMAN (DOREEN) who's guiding a TOUR GROUP through the lobby. Doreen wears a uniform like Kate's, plus a matching HAT in the shape of the building. 
DOREEN .hope you've enjoyed your tour of the world's most modern automated office building. Don't forget, copies of Mr. Clamp's best-selling book, I Took Manhattan, are on sale at the newsstand... 
KATE Don't let things get to you.

BEEPS. At the sound, Forster changes course, heading for an ALCOVE offer the lobby, where he unlks_ a cabinet and opens it ' -ï¿½"eveal it big TV SCREEN with Clamp's impatient face on it, and a i&e _ CAMERA on top.

As he looks into the lab, peering curiously at SCIENTISTS, GADGETS, potted PLANTS and caged ANIMALS, his attention is captured by a SOUND from the 0 back -- Gizmo's song, in that sad minor key.

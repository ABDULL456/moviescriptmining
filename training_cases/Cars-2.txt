MATER Don't sweat it. These things happen to everybody, Otis. 
OTIS But you never leak oil. 
MATER Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't tell nobody, but I think my rust is starting to show through. 
Mater and Otis drive past THE RADIATOR SPRINGS WELCOME SIGN. It has been amended to say: "Home of Lightning McQueen." 
OTIS Hey, is Lightning McQueen back yet? 
MATER Not yet. 
OTIS He must be crazy-excited about winning his fourth Piston Cup. Four! Wow! 
MATER Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him. But I sure wish he'd hurry up and get back `cause we got a whole summer's worth of best friend fun to make up for. Just me and -- 
Ahead of them, a half-mile off, a RED RACE CAR is visible. 
MATER --- McQueen! 
Mater FLOORS IT, dragging poor Otis behind him. 
OTIS Uh, Mater? I'm in no hurry. You don't need to go so fast! 
Boom! They hit a bump. Otis catches air. 
EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY 
Lightning McQueen is surrounded by his hometown friends. 
LUIGI Oh, Lightning. Welcome home. 
FLO Good to have you back, honey. 
FILLMORE Congratulations, man. 
SARGE Welcome home, soldier. 
SHERIFF The place wasn't the same without you, son. 
LIZZIE What? Did he go somewhere? 
MCQUEEN It's good to be home, everybody. 
MATER (O.S.) McQueen! 
They all turn around, see Mater speeding into town, with Otis swerving behind him. 
MCQUEEN Mater! 
MATER McQueen! 
Mater skids into main street and in one swift motion, slingshots Otis forward --- 
OTIS Woaahhhhh! 
--- right through Ramone's front door --- 
INT. RAMONE'S - CONTINUOUS 
--- where he lands perfectly on the hydraulic lift. Ramone lifts him up, routine. 
RAMONE Hey. How far'd you make it this time, Otis? 
OTIS Halfway to the county line. 
RAMONE Not bad, man. 
OTIS I know, I can't believe it either! 
EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - CONTINUOUS 
MATER McQueen, welcome back! 
MCQUEEN Mater, it's so good to see you. 
MATER You too, buddy. 
Mater and McQueen do an ELABORATE TIRE BUMP (fist bump style). 
MATER Oh, man. You ain't gonna believe the things I got planned for us. 
Everyone watches as the tire bump continues. 
MACK (to Lizzie, an aside) These best friend greetings get longer every year. 
MATER (TO MCQUEEN) You ready to have some serious fun? 
MCQUEEN Well, actually I've got something to show you first. 
INT. RADIATOR SPRINGS MUSEUM - DAY 
CLOSE ON THE PISTON CUP. It has now changed, been adorned with a small likeness of Doc. It says "Hudson Hornet Piston Cup." 
MATER Wow. I can't believe they renamed the Piston Cup after our very own Doc Hudson. 
McQueen and Mater are alone, the museum closed to the public. McQueen approaches a "Hudson Hornet" wall with Doc's three Piston cups, framed articles, other racing ephemera. 
MCQUEEN I know Doc said these things were just old cups, but to have someone else win it just didn't feel right, you know? 
MATER Well, Doc would've been real proud of you. That's for sure. 
McQueen takes this in. 
MATER Now, can I start you two lovebirds off with a couple drinks? 
MCQUEEN Yes. I'll have my usual. 
SALLY You know what? I'm going to have that too. 
Mater blinks. 
MATER Uh, right. Your usual. CUT TO: 
INSIDE AT THE BAR - Fillmore and Sarge watch as Guido mixes drinks, ala "Cocktail." Mater arrives. 
MATER Guido! What's McQueen's usual? 
GUIDO (in Italian, subtitled) How should I know? 
MATER Perfect! Give me two of `em. 
SARGE Quiet! My program's on. 
MEL DORADO (O.S.) Tonight on "The Mel Dorado Show"! 
ON THE BAR TV - "THE MEL DORADO SHOW," a cable talk show, begins with file footage of MILES AXLEROD, a sleek SUV. 
MEL DORADO (ON TV) His story gripped the world! Oil billionaire Miles Axlerod, in an attempt to become the first car to circumnavigate the globe without GPS, ironically ran out of gas and found himself trapped in the wild! 
We see images of newspaper headlines, search crews. 
MEL DORADO (ON TV) Feared dead, he emerged 36 days later, running on a fuel he'd distilled himself from the natural elements! Since then he's sold his oil fortune, converted himself from a gas-guzzler into an electric car, and has devoted his life to finding a renewable, clean-burning fuel! 
Images of oil derricks torn down; Miles Axlerod getting converted to electric; lab scientists testing chemicals. 
MEL DORADO (ON TV) Now he claims to have done it with his Allinol. 
Images of fields, rivers, vegetables, and mountains all combining to form the Allinol logo. 
MEL DORADO (ON TV) And to show the world what his new superfuel can do, he's created a racing competition like no other, inviting the greatest champions from around the globe to battle in the first ever World Grand Prix. Welcome Sir Miles Axlerod. 
SIR MILES AXLEROD arrives, parks across from Mel's desk. 
MILES AXLEROD (ON TV) Thank you, Mel. It is very good to be here. Now listen to me: Big Oil. It costs a fortune. Pollution is getting worse. I mean, come on. It's a fossil fuel. Fossil. As in dead dinosaurs. And we all know what happened to them. Alternative energy is the future. Trust me, Mel, after seeing Allinol in action at the World Grand Prix, nobody will ever go back to gasoline again. 
MATER (TO FILLMORE) What happened to the dinosaurs, now? 
MEL DORADO (ON TV) And on satellite, a World Grand Prix competitor and one of the fastest cars in the world, Francesco Bernoulli. 
Across the screen: LIVE FROM ROME, ITALY. We meet Formula race car FRANCESCO BERNOULLI. 
FRANCESCO (ON TV) It is an honor, Signore Dorado. For you. 
MEL DORADO (ON TV) Miles, why not invite Lightning McQueen? 
Mater, collecting his drinks, looks up, half-intrigued. 
MILES AXLEROD (ON TV) Of course we invited him. But apparently after a very long racing season he is taking some time off to rest. 
FRANCESCO (ON TV) Lightning McQueen would not have a chance against Francesco! 
Mater doesn't like this. 
FRANCESCO (ON TV) I can go over 300 kilometers an hour! In miles that is like, uh... way faster than McQueen. 
MEL DORADO (ON TV) Let's go to the phones. Baltimore, Maryland, you're on the air. 
CALLER (ON TV) Am I on? Hello? 
MEL DORADO (ON TV) You're on. Go ahead. 
CALLER (ON TV) Hello? 
MEL DORADO (ON TV) Go ahead, caller. 
Dial tone. 
MEL DORADO (ON TV) Let's go to Radiator Springs. You're on, caller. 
MATER'S VOICE (ON TV) Yeah, that Italian feller you got on there can't talk that way about Lightning McQueen. He's the bestest race car in the whole wide world. 
Fillmore and Sarge look around. Mater is visible in the back of the bar on an office phone. 
SARGE Uh-oh... 
FRANCESCO (ON TV) If he is, how you say "the bestest race car," then why must he rest, eh? 
MATER'S VOICE (ON TV) Cause he knows what's important. Every now and then he prefers just to slow down, enjoy life. 
FRANCESCO (ON TV) Ah, you heard it! Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow! Of course, this is not news to Francesco. When I want to go to sleep I watch one of his races. After two laps I am out cold. 
Audible RXNS from the bar. A crowd has been forming ever since Mater started talking. 
MATER'S VOICE (ON TV) That ain't what I meant. CUT TO: 
MCQUEEN AND SALLY - They hear the commotion inside. 
MCQUEEN Hey, what's going on over there? CUT BACK TO: 
THE BAR - Sally and McQueen push through the crowd, see that they're watching Francesco on the television. 
MCQUEEN (TO SALLY) Oh, it's that Italian Formula car. His name is --- 
SALLY Francesco Bernoulli. No wonder there's a crowd. 
When Sally says his name, she enunciates each part, as if Italian were her mother's tongue. 
Team McQueen enters via a second floor landing which overlooks a massive indoor party in a converted museum. As they roll down a ramp to the party, they are awed. 
LUIGI Guido, look! Ferraris and tires! Let's go! 
MCQUEEN (IMPRESSED) Hey, look at this. Okay now Mater, remember: best behavior. 
MATER You got it, buddy. Hey, what's that? 
He sees something, peels away. 
MCQUEEN Mater! 
LEWIS HAMILTON Hey, McQueen, over here! 
It's fellow racers JEFF GORVETTE and LEWIS HAMILTON. McQueen now has no choice but to let Mater go. 
MCQUEEN Hey, Jeff. Lewis! CUT TO: 
MATER as he approaches a GLASS-ENCLOSED ROCK GARDEN where a pitty RAKES rocks with precision. He knocks on the glass with his hook. 
MATER Hey! You done good! You got all the leaves! 
People turn at the noise he's making. CUT BACK TO: 
MCQUEEN, JEFF and LEWIS. 
JEFF GORVETTE Check out that tow truck. 
LEWIS HAMILTON I wonder who that guy's with? 
MCQUEEN Will you guys excuse me just for one little second? 
He zips over to Mater's side, quickly pulls him out of sight. 
MCQUEEN Mater, listen. This isn't Radiator Springs. 
MATER You're just realizing that? Boy, that jet-lag really done a number on you. 
MCQUEEN Mater, look -- things are different over here. Which means maybe you should, you know, act a little different too. 
MATER Different than what? 
MCQUEEN Well, just... help me out here, buddy. I --- 
MATER You need help? Shoot, why didn't you just say so? That's what a tow truck does. Hey, looky there, it's Mr. San Francisco! 
FRANCESCO is visible across the room, holding court. 
MATER I'll introduce you. 
MCQUEEN Mater, no. 
MATER (already on his way) Look at me -- I'm helping you already! 
On FRANCESCO - MOMENTS LATER. Mater approaches, giddy. 
MATER Hey Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you to meet --- 
FRANCESCO Lightning McQueen! Buona sera. 
MCQUEEN Nice to meet you, Francesco. 
FRANCESCO Yeah, nice to meet you too. You are very good-looking. Not as good as I thought, but you're good. 
MATER (TO FRANCESCO) Excuse me. Can I get a picture with you? 
FRANCESCO Anything for McQueen's friend. 
As Mater poses for a photo with Francesco: 
MATER Miss Sally is gonna flip when she sees this. She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend. 
FRANCESCO Oooh. 
MATER She's a big fan of yours. 
FRANCESCO Hey, she has good taste. 
MCQUEEN Mater's prone to exaggeration. I wouldn't say she's a "big" fan. 
MATER You're right. She's a huge fan. She goes on and on about your open wheels here. 
MCQUEEN Mentioning it once doesn't qualify as going "on and on." 
FRANCESCO Francesco is familiar with this reaction to Francesco. Women respect a car that has nothing to hide. 
MCQUEEN Yeah, uh... 
FRANCESCO Let us have a toast. 
McQueen doesn't like where this is going, covers. 
MCQUEEN Let's. 
FRANCESCO (raising a drink) I dedicate my win tomorrow... to Miss Sally. 
MCQUEEN Oh, sorry. I already dedicated MY win tomorrow to her. So if we both do it, it's really not so special. Besides, I don't have a drink. 
MATER I'll go get you one. You mind if I borrow a few bucks for one of them drinks? 
MCQUEEN (could kill him) They're free, Mater. 
MATER Free? Well, shoot, what am I doing here? 
HOLLEY (INTO RADIO) Extremely. 
FINN (OVER RADIO) Then it's him. 
It's settled. Holley takes one more nervous breath, quickly closes the distance between her and Mater, cuts him off. He is forced to STOP. 
HOLLEY Hello. 
MATER Well, hello. 
HOLLEY A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator. 
MATER Well of course it doesn't. That's `cause it's air-cooled! 
HOLLEY (RELIEVED) Perfect. I'm from the Tokyo Station OF THE--- 
MATER Course, Karmann Ghia's weren't the only ones. Besides the Beetles you had your Type-3 Squarebacks, with the pancake motors... 
HOLLEY Yeah. Okay, I get it--- 
MATER ... And before both of them, there's the Type-2 buses - my buddy Fillmore's one of them. 
HOLLEY Listen! We should find somewhere more private. 
MATER Uh, gee. Don't you think that's a little, uh --- 
HOLLEY (NERVOUS ENERGY) You're right. Impossible to know which areas here are compromised. So, when can I see you again? 
MATER Well, let's see. Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races. 
HOLLEY Got it. We'll rendezvous then. 
INT. PARTY - MOMENTS LATER 
Mater returns to his team, lost in thought. 
MCQUEEN There you are. Where have you been? 
MATER What's a rendezvous? 
LUIGI It's like a date. 
MATER A date?! 
MCQUEEN Mater, what's going on? 
MATER Well, what's going on is I've got me a date tomorrow. 
Guido makes a crack in Italian. 
LUIGI Guido don't believe you. 
MATER Well, believe it. My new girlfriend just said so. Hey, there she is. 
Mater points out Holley, who's within earshot. 
MATER (YELLING) Hey! Hey lady! 
Holley, caught in plain view, DRIVES OFF. 
MATER See ya tomorrow! 
Guido makes another crack in Italian. 
LUIGI Guido still don't believe you. 
EXT. SHIPYARD - THE DOCKS - TOKYO NIGHT 
An industrial dock, outside of the city proper. 
INT. SHIPYARD - NIGHT 
Rod Redline dangles from a car magnet. He's been beaten up, clings to consciousness. 
GREM (O.S.) I gotta admit --- 
Grem, Acer, and a bunch of nasty looking troublemakers look up at Rod amidst crates and shipping containers. 
GREM --- you tricked us real good. 
ACER And we don't like being tricked. 
Rod Redline laughs to himself. 
ACER Hey, what's so funny? 
ROD REDLINE Well, you know, I was just wearing a disguise. You guys are stuck looking like that. 
This doesn't help him. They DROP HIM onto a TREADMILL, lock him down. A container is wheeled forward and Rod is plied with Allinol brand gasoline. 
ROD REDLINE Allinol? Thanks, fellas. I hear this stuff is good for you. 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (O.S.) So you think. 
The Professor emerges from the darkness, behind Rod. 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Allinol by itself is good for you. 
Zundapp hits a button and the TREADMILL starts Rod's wheels spinning at a high rate of speed. 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP But after microscopic examination, I have found that it has one small weakness. When hit with an electromagnetic pulse, it becomes extremely dangerous. 
GREM SMILE --- 
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) It's time to find out. The racers are locking into the grid --- 
Engines rev as everyone gets ready to go. Everyone's bright eyed and alert except for McQueen who we find in the back of the grid. He CLOSES his eyes. 
MCQUEEN (TO HIMSELF) Speed. I am speed. 
A LAUGH O.S. McQueen opens his eyes. Francesco is next to him on the grid. 
FRANCESCO Really? You are "speed"? Then Francesco is triple speed. (closes his eyes) Francesco. Is. Triple speed. Francesco likes this, McQueen. It's really getting him into the zone! 
MCQUEEN He is so getting beat today. 
The starting lights click down from RED to YELLOW to GREEN. The race begins. Francesco quickly grabs the lead. He's pulling away within seconds. 
ON PIT ROW - We TRACK PAST as the various Crew Chiefs on their crash carts bark orders to their racers. We end on Team McQueen. No Crew Chief, just a solid looking team. 
SARGE His suspension stats look good. 
LUIGI Tire pressure is excellent. 
FILLMORE He's got plenty of fuel. 
MATER And he's awesome! CUT TO: 
The same view of Mater but now THROUGH A TELESCOPIC DISPLAY. Reveal Finn and Holley watching from high above in a downtown office building, behind reflective glass. 
HOLLEY Why is he in the pits? He's so exposed. 
FINN It's his cover. One of the best I've seen, too. Look at the detail on that rust. It must have cost him a fortune. 
HOLLEY But why hasn't he contacted us yet? 
FINN There's probably heat on him. Be patient. 
HOLLEY Right, of course. He'll signal us when he can. 
FINN And then we find out who's behind all this. 
ON THE TRACK - VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE RACE through Tokyo as Francesco extends his lead and McQueen attempts to make up ground. 
IN MCQUEEN'S PIT - Mater watches the monitors, sees them approaching the dirt section. 
MATER McQueen! It's time to make your move. Get on the outside and show 'em what Doc done taught you. 
MCQUEEN (OVER RADIO) Ten four, Mater. 
ON THE TRACK - Francesco hits the dirt section and loses all control. He SLAMS to a halt, his tires getting no traction. 
DAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.) Francesco is brought to a screeching halt! 
MCQUEEN skids into view, turning right to go left, passing Francesco, followed by other cars --- 
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) Lightning McQueen is the first to take advantage. And just like that, folks, Francesco's lead is left in the dust. 
MCQUEEN Nice call, Mater. Keep it up! 
McQueen now leads the pack, zooming out of the dirt now starting to relax. 
DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.) Who-hoo! Man, McQueen looks happier than a rollbar at a demolition derby! 
ON PAVED ROAD AGAIN - MOMENTS LATER 
The field of cars thunders into a tunnel. 
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) Everyone's jostling for position as we hit the asphalt again. 
Francesco crests the hill, in last place. He bites down, determined, then CHASES. 
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) Francesco lost a lot of momentum in the dirt. He's got some serious work ahead of him if he wants to get back in this race. 
VARIOUS SHOTS OF TOKYO as the racers move through the Rainbow Bridge. Bit by bit, Francesco ekes his way toward the front, toward Lightning McQueen as we CUT TO --- 
--- A ROOFTOP, and a VIEW THROUGH THE WGP CAMERA LENS. Grem and Acer are manning this one. They focus it on the racers as they approach. 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (OVER RADIO) It is time. 
GREM Roger that. 
ON THE TRACK - A racer (Miguel Camino) suddenly PLUMES WITH SMOKE and skids out. 
DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.) Oh! Miguel Camino has blown an engine! 
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) Very unusual, Darrell. He's been so consistent all year. 
Camino quickly pits, passing McQueen's pit where Mater is visible. 
ON GREM AND ACER, watching from above. 
GREM You gotta be kidding me. 
ACER What is it? 
GREM It's that tow truck from the bathroom. 
ACER The one from the bathroom? 
GREM Yeah, the one the American Agent passed the device to. 
ACER What about him? 
GREM What about him? He's in the pits! 
ACER Not for long. 
ON MATER - Slowing at the flower shop. 
HOLLEY (OVER RADIO) No! Don't go 'in' anywhere. Just keep moving. 
MATER Stay outside. Gotcha. 
ON THE TRACK 
MCQUEEN Outside? 
McQueen drifts outside allowing Francesco to slip past! 
FRANCESCO Grazie and arrivaderci! 
DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.) I cannot believe what I just saw, Brent. That was a bonehead move. You don't open up the inside like that! 
IN THE BACK ALLEYS - As Mater moves on he's followed by Pacers and Gremlins. Suddenly --- 
--- CABLES whip in front of them, pulling over flower vending machines and sending the shop's owners into a frenzy. They direct their attention to the AMCs, who try and explain. 
ON FINN, admiring his handiwork as he appears. Just as he turns to leave he's BROADSIDED and pushed INTO A DARK ALLEY. 
IN THE ALLEY - Finn finds himself boxed by two Pacers and pushed toward --- 
--- ACER, who now holds a FLAME THROWER. 
ACER This time I'm gonna make sure you stay dead. 
He hits the flame. WHOOOSSSH!! 
ON ANOTHER STREET - Mater clicks along, still looking for Holley. Just as he passes the alley entrance where Finn stares down death: 
HOLLEY (OVER RADIO) You're doing brilliantly. Now just stay focused. 
MATER What's that? You want me to head toward that ruckus? 
Mater turns INTO the alley. 
HOLLEY (OVER RADIO) No! Don't go down that street! 
IN THE ALLEY - Finn, now nearly pushed completely into the flame thrower, leaps into the air. He FIGHTS BACK, using his wheels, axle, indeed his entire car frame as if he were human, kicking and tossing and shooting his enemies. 
Mater witnesses the whole thing. 
MATER Wow! A live karate demonstration! 
ON THE TRACK - McQueen, now playing catch-up again, scowls. 
MCQUEEN Stop it, Mater. Just sign off. 
IN THE BACK ALLEY - Finn polishes off the AMCs by firing a bullet into a gas main line, causing an EXPLOSION that tosses Acer through the air where he lands in a NOODLE SHOP'S SIGN. 
ON THE TRACK - The end of the race is nigh --- 
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) They're bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line! 
The Formula car gets there first. 
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) Francesco's the winner, McQueen's number two! 
IN THE ALLEY - Finn heaves breaths, surveys his damage. 
MATER That was cool! Hey, can I get your autograph? 
Mater approaches when a MASS OF RACE FANS burst out a door, momentarily blocking Mater's view of Finn. Once the fans have past, Finn has disappeared. 
MATER Hey, where'd he go? 
HOLLEY (OVER RADIO) Our rendezvous has been jeopardized. Keep the device safe. We'll be in touch. 
MATER Dadgum, did I miss our date? 
EXT. PRESS STAGE - LATER 
Post race press conference. Francesco is center stage. 
DARRELL CARTRIP Francesco, over here! Hey, what was your strategy today? 
FRANCESCO Strategia? Francesco needs no strategy, it's very simple. You start the race, wait for Lightning McQueen to choke, pass him, then win. Francesco always wins. It's boring. 
McQueen, waiting in the wings, rolls his eyes. He suddenly notices something O.S. 
McQueen's P.O.V. - It's MATER, appearing from a side street, moving toward the pits, oblivious of the press conference. 
DARRELL CARTRIP (TO FRANCESCO) I gotta tell you, dude. You were in trouble for awhile. That dirt track section had you crawling! 
As McQueen SNEAKS AWAY --- 
FRANCESCO To truly crush one's dream, you must first raise their hopes very high. 
IN MCQUEEN'S PIT GARAGE - Mater looks around for everyone as McQueen approaches. 
MCQUEEN Mater. 
MATER Hey McQueen! What happened? Is the race over? You won, right? 
MCQUEEN Mater, why were you yelling things at me while I was racing? 
MATER Yelling? Oh, you thought... that's funny right there. Nah, see that's `cause I seen these two fellers doing some sort of karate street performance. It was nutso. One of them even had a flamethrower --- 
MCQUEEN A flamethrower? What are you talking about? I don't understand. Where were you? 
MATER Going to meet my date. 
A MONTAGE OF PARIS: Mater attempts to merge into roundabout traffic; mimes annoy tourists at the Eiffel Tower; a painter works his magic on an unattractive couple; a couple kisses on the most romantic spot in the world; we might even catch GASTOW'S RESTAURANT. 
The charming, low-key introduction ends with a SWEEPING VISTA of Paris's center from far away as we CRANE DOWN INTO --- 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
--- a dirty street in the 1st Arrondissement. Finn and Holley drive along together as Mater, playing "spy," darts back and forth behind them from doorway to dumpster, "hiding out." He's having a ball. 
FINN (TO HOLLEY) Once we're inside, stay close. Don't bother checking VIN numbers for criminal records, they're all dodgy here. 
HOLLEY No VIN scans. Got it. 
FINN Don't talk to anyone. Don't look at anyone. And absolutely, positively no idling. Are we clear? 
HOLLEY Yes, right. No idling. Yes, sir. 
FINN Mater? 
MATER Yeah, Finn? 
FINN We're not here to go shopping. 
As Finn and Holley and Mater turn the corner... 
MATER Shopping? What do you mean? Why would I --- 
Mater turns the corner and enters a massive Les Halles- inspired Parisian market filled with car parts. A tow truck's dream. 
MATER Dadgum. 
MERCHANTS - Parts for sale, Monsieur! - Monsieur! Parts for sale! 
IN THE MARKET - MOMENTS LATER 
Mater rolls along, impressed by the goods for sale. 
MATER You gotta be kidding me - they've got everything here. Look at them hoods! I could use a hood. 
Mater continues on though, heeding Finn's advice. 
MATER Sorry fellers, I gotta go. 
INT. ENCLOSED MARKETPLACE - DAY 
Mater, now out of sight of Finn and Holley, passes a darkened stall. He STOPS, peers in. There's someone in there. 
MATER Excuse me. What are you selling? 
It suddenly OPENS its headlights revealing... EYES!! In French, the mutant car pitches his wares to Mater. Mater FREAKS OUT, speeds off, TERRIFIED. 
AROUND THE CORNER - FINN AND HOLLEY 
A few car lengths ahead of Mater. They roll along, looking for... Aha! Finn and Holley recede into the shadows. 
In FINN'S SIDE MIRROR: TOMBER, a three-wheeled parts dealer, argues with a French customer. 
FINN There you are. 
Mater suddenly turns the corner, sees Finn and Holley. 
MATER Man, there are some great --- 
FINN Mater, get back! 
Too late. Tomber sees Mater, then notices FINN, reflected in a hubcap. He BOLTS. Finn and Holley give chase. 
MATER Hey, wait for me! 
Tomber, skidding away, kicks a tent in Finn's way. Holley quickly pivots RIGHT and disappears. Where did she go? 
Finn, hot in pursuit, leaps another obstacle and loses ground TO --- 
--- Tomber who turns a corner and finds himself grill to grill with HOLLEY. He whips to the left but TURNS OVER, rolling sideways and CRASHING to a stop. 
Holley ZAPS him with ELECTROSHOCKERS. Finn suddenly arrives, stops her. 
FINN (TO HOLLEY) Have you lost your mind?! 
HOLLEY But I thought --- 
FINN Mater! This chap needs a tow. Hook him up. 
MATER Sure thing. CUT TO: 
MOMENTS LATER - Mater tows Tomber, following Finn and Holley. 
TOMBER You rusty piece of junk, get your dirty hook off me! 
INT. A SMALL GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER 
Finn throws open a door. Cars scatter like cockroaches. 
FINN (to the cars) Allez! Maintenant - vite! 
Mater unhooks an angry Tomber who spits in French. Finn pulls the door down. As it LATCHES TIGHT --- 
TOMBER (TO FINN) Electroshock! Are you kidding me?? 
FINN Easy, Tomber. This is her first field assignment - she didn't know you were my informant. 
HOLLEY Informant? 
TOMBER A rookie, eh? I never liked new car- smell. 
Holley SNAPS Mater's picture, temporarily blinding him. 
MATER Ahh! 
Holley turns back to her monitor. Mater's face appears on screen. She quickly GRAFTS it over the Hugo's tow truck's. 
FINN Good job, Miss Shiftwell. 
Holley isn't sure what surprises her more: the compliment or how pleased it makes her. 
HOLLEY Thank you, Finn. 
MATER Boy, I sure wish my friends could see me now. 
EXT. SMALL TOWN - ITALY - OUTSIDE PORTO CORSA - DAY 
A quaint Italian piazza. A pristine MASERATI FOUNTAIN, complete with ancient trident, looms in our view. 
Luigi and Guido roll into view. 
LUIGI Guido, your eyes do not deceive you. We are in Italy. We are home! 
Sarge, Fillmore and McQueen exit a WGP transport truck. 
FILLMORE Hey, Luigi. Which way to the hotel, man? 
LUIGI What? No friends of mine will stay in a hotel in my village. You will stay with my --- Uncle Topolino! 
UNCLE TOPOLINO, a distinguished 1937 Fiat Topolino, rolls forward. He greets them warmly with affectionate Italian salutations as word of Guido and Luigi's arrival spreads. The square FILLS with family and friends. 
EXT. PIAZZA - DUSK 
A festive homecoming party. Lights strung across the square. Music and dancing. Fillmore and Sarge are at a dining table. 
SARGE How do they do it? These are the same ingredients as back home, but it tastes so good. 
FILLMORE It's organic, man. 
SARGE Tree hugger. 
LIGHTNING MCQUEEN rolls along the periphery of the square, seems lost in thought. 
UNCLE TOPOLINO (O.S.) Race car. 
Uncle Topolino beckons McQueen over. 
UNCLE TOPOLINO You look so down, so low. Is like you have flat tires. 
MAMA TOPOLINO, a hefty Italian grandmother pipes up, a mile a minute then drives off, now a car on a mission. 
UNCLE TOPOLINO She said you look like you're starving. That she's going to make you a big meal, and fatten you up. 
MCQUEEN No, Mama Topolino, please. You don't need to make a fuss! 
Too late. She's disappeared inside her kitchen. 
UNCLE TOPOLINO Capisco. I understand. Is a problem, yes? Between you and a friend? 
MCQUEEN How'd you know that? 
UNCLE TOPOLINO A wise car hears one word and understands two. 
McQueen takes this in, impressed. 
UNCLE TOPOLINO That, and Luigi told me. While Mama cooks, come and take a stroll with me. 
They amble forward, Uncle Topolino setting the pace. 
MCQUEEN I brought my friend Mater along on the trip. And I told him he needed to act different, that we weren't in Radiator Springs. 
UNCLE TOPOLINO This Mater. He's a close friend? 
MCQUEEN He's my best friend. 
UNCLE TOPOLINO Then why would you ask him to be someone else? 
McQueen considers this - a realization. 
MCQUEEN What did I do? I said some things during our fight... 
UNCLE TOPOLINO You know, back when Guido and Luigi used to work for me, they would fight over everything. 
IN THE SQUARE - Guido dances with a girl. Luigi suddenly CUTS IN. They begin to ARGUE. 
UNCLE TOPOLINO They fight over what Ferrari was the best Ferrari; which one of them look more like a Ferrari... There were even some non-Ferrari fights. 
Guido now LIFTS Luigi, cuts BACK in. 
UNCLE TOPOLINO So I tell them, va bene. It's okay to fight. Everybody fights now and then, especially best friends. 
McQueen takes this in. Seems to take some small comfort. 
UNCLE TOPOLINO But you gotta make up fast. 
McQueen's comfort quickly evaporates. 
UNCLE TOPOLINO No fight more important than friendship. 
Guido and Luigi now dance together with the girl and her friend who has just arrived. All having a great time. They dance past us, crossing in front of MCQUEEN AND UNCLE TOPOLINO. We STAY WITH them. 
UNCLE TOPOLINO Chi trova un'amico, trova un tesoro. 
MCQUEEN What does that mean? 
FINN You look a little light on weapons. 
Off Mater's RXN --- 
EXT. ALPS - DAWN 
--- STEPHENSON EMERGES LOUDLY from a tunnel. He powers forward, starts his descent into Italy --- 
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) You are looking live at beautiful Porto Corsa, Italy, on the Italian Riviera. What a magnificent setting for the second race of the World Grand Prix. 
EXT. PORTO CORSA, ITALY - DAY 
Over sweeping helicopter BEAUTY SHOTS: 
DAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.) Well Brent, they call this place "The Gem of the Riviera," and it's easy to see why. 
A local fishing boat chugs through an idyllic waterway, beneath bridges that connect hillside villas. 
DAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.) With its secluded beaches and opulent casinos, Porto Corsa truly is a playground for the wealthy. 
A long line of RICH-LOOKING YACHTS in the harbor. 
DAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.) And everyone who's anyone is here today. 
Rich SPORTS CARS drive past pricey shops. 
DAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.) From the ultra-rich and super- famous, to world leaders and important dignitaries. 
THE POPEMOBILE, visible in a crowd, drives through town. 
DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.) You aren't kidding, David. You can't do a three-point turn around here without bumping into some celebrity! 
HELICOPTER SHOT of the Casino. 
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) Welcome everyone to the second race of the World Grand Prix! CUT TO: 
MUSTANGBURGER, HOBBSCAP and CARTRIP in the control booth. 
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER The big news continues to be Allinol. Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to the press earlier today to answer questions about its safety. 
FOOTAGE OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE - Miles Axlerod, at a podium, addresses the press throng. He looks a bit exasperated. 
MILES AXLEROD An independent panel of scientists has determined that Allinol is completely safe. Okay? Safe! There it is. 
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER So the race will go on, folks. 
RACE GRAPHICS show Francesco with 10 points at the top of the race standings. 
DARRELL CARTRIP But the question everyone is asking: Will the real Lightning McQueen show up today? 
ON THE TRACK - As the racers begin to get into position on the grid. 
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) Well, he better. Talk about a home- track advantage. Francesco Bernoulli grew up racing on this course. 
ITALIAN TRACK ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Signore e signori, in the pole position, numero uno... 
The crowd is cheering already, knows who this is. 
ITALIAN TRACK ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ... Francescoooooo! 
The Italian crowd roars and chants for their hometown hero. 
FRANCESCO (to the crowd) Bellissima! Thank you for your support. (TO MCQUEEN) And your big mistake, McQueen! 
McQueen missed this comment. He approaches his grid position, lost in thought. 
ITALIAN TRACK ANNOUNCER (V.O.) In the secondo position. Numero novantacinque. Lightning McQueen! 
Cheers (not so thunderous, obviously) from the crowd. McQueen doesn't seem to notice. 
IN MCQUEEN'S PIT - His team exchanges looks, worried. 
LUIGI McQueen? Is everything okay? 
FILLMORE If you're worried about your fuel, man, don't. It's perfectly safe. 
BACK ON THE STARTING GRID 
MCQUEEN No, guys, I just really wish Mater were here. 
FRANCESCO (O.S.) Francesco understands, McQueen. 
Francesco parks next to him, grinning. 
MCQUEEN Oh, great. Here it comes. What've you got, Francesco? 
FRANCESCO For famous race cars like Francesco and well... you, to be far away from home is not easy. 
MCQUEEN I think you forgot the insulting part of that insult. 
FRANCESCO Is no insult. When Francesco is away from home, he misses his mama just like you miss your tow truck amico. 
MCQUEEN Gee, I maybe misjudged you, because that's exactly how I --- 
FRANCESCO Of course, I am at home. And my mama is right here. 
Francesco refers to his MAMA who sits in a special box in the crowd, cheering him on, blowing him kisses. 
FRANCESCO (YELLS) Mama! Don't worry, Mama! (MORE) 
FRANCESCO (CONT'D) McQueen is very sad! I will beat his cry-baby bottom today! 
MCQUEEN And there's the insult we were missing. Grazie! 
The Hugos on either side of Mater exchange a look. 
HOLLEY (OVER RADIO) That's because it is, Mater. Now, be careful what you say. 
MATER Why is that? What do you mean don't talk to you? (more talking from Holley which we cannot hear) So you want me to stop talking to you. Right now? 
ALEXANDER HUGO You are acting strange today, Ivan. 
MATER I have no idea what you're talking about... 
MATER'S P.O.V. - A digital readout isolates the Hugo and starts to scroll reams of information alongside. 
MATER ...Alexander Hugo, aka "Chop Shop Alex." 
IN A WIDER SHOT we realize this display is invisible to all but Mater. Some of Alex's other alias' include "Alexander Hu- Don't Go" and "Alexander the Not-So Great." 
MATER Hey, you got a lot of aka's, Alex. But I guess that makes sense seeings how you's wanted in France, Germany, the Czech Republic... 
HOLLEY (cutting in to his DISPLAY) Mater! Stop it! 
Alexander Hugo, unaware of Holley's interruption, whispers to Mater as they turn a corner. 
ALEXANDER HUGO Okay, okay. Keep your voice down. You're gonna make me arrested. (to the other Hugos) Don't mess with Ivan today. He's in a bad mood. 
EXT. CASINO - DAY 
Holley, hearing this, can't believe it. 
FINN He's so good. 
INT. CASINO - DAY 
Mater tows Victor inside a private room, where inside are the WORLD'S WORST CARS including VLADMIR TRUNKOV, TUBBS PACER and J. CURBY GREMLIN. 
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV Victor! 
TUBBS PACER Hey, Victor! 
J. CURBY GREMLIN There you are. 
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV Come in, come in. 
J. CURBY GREMLIN Victor Hugo. I'm J. Curby Gremlin, from Detroit. It's good to see you. Now we can start. 
VICTOR HUGO Is the big boss here yet? 
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV No, not yet. 
TUBBS PACER He's supposed to be here any minute. 
WHAM! A DOOR is thrown open O.S. Everyone turns, now silent. 
ON THE DOOR - It sits open. No one enters. 
The room of Lemons watch, nervous. 
ON MATER - Nervously watching too. 
EXT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS 
FINN Here we go. 
INT. PRIVATE ROOM - CASINO - CONTINUOUS 
A car finally appears. It's Zundapp. 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Guten Tag! 
Everyone looks disappointed. 
TUBBS PACER It's just the Professor. 
VICTOR HUGO Zundapp, when is he coming? 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP He's already here. 
MONITORS descend from the ceiling. On them, an image of AN ENGINE - the same bloody engine from the photo. But this is a LIVE image. The car is being worked on. 
VOICE Welcome, everyone. 
The VOICE is garbled, scrambled. No way to determine who. 
ENGINE VOICE I wish I could be with you on this very special day but... my clutch assembly broke. You know how it is. 
The Lemons all nod in understanding. 
TUBBS PACER Been there. 
J. CURBY GREMLIN Forget about it. 
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV We know how you feel. 
EXT. CASINO 
FINN Descramble that voice! 
HOLLEY (already on it) I'm trying... It's too sophisticated! 
INT. PRIVATE ROOM - CASINO - CONTINUOUS 
ENGINE VOICE We are here to celebrate. Today all your hard work pays off. The world turned their backs on cars like us. They stopped manufacturing us, stopped making our parts. The only thing they haven't stopped doing is laughing at us. They've called us terrible names... 
On VICTOR HUGO. 
ENGINE VOICE They will come to us and they will have no choice, `cause they will need us. 
ON FINN - He SPEEDS up a road, Grem and Acer visible ahead of him. He LEAPS over the crevasse toward the AMC cousins --- 
Suddenly, FINN FREEZES. He's immobilized in mid-air! 
He looks up. A CHOPPER with a LARGE MAGNET hovers over him. 
ACER (TO FINN) We figured you might stop by. 
ENGINE VOICE (V.O.) And they will finally respect us. So hold your hoods high. After today you will never again be ashamed of who you are! 
Grem and Acer turn back to the camera. They line up Shu Todoroki, who's a bit further along now. 
FINN No! 
INT. PRIVATE ROOM - CASINO - CONTINUOUS 
ENGINE VOICE Long live Lemons! 
EXT. RACE COURSE 
Grem ZAPS THE RACER. 
Flames burst from Todoroki. He loses control. 
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) Number seven is loose! Shu Todoroki! 
Shu takes down three more cars with him and others follow suit. It's a nightmare pileup. 
EXT. CASINO - SAME 
Holley sees Finn being flown away by the chopper. 
HOLLEY Finn. 
EXT. FINISH LINE - PORTO CORSA - CONTINUOUS 
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) Bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line. 
McQueen NOSES out Francesco for a win, both oblivious to what's just happened. 
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.) McQueen's the winner, Francesco's second. And they have no idea what happened behind them. 
MCQUEEN Yeah! 
FRANCESCO Dah! This is impossible! 
MCQUEEN That's what I'm talking about. Kachow! Hey, where are all the other cars? 
FRANCESCO What is going on? 
They see the pile-up from an overhead monitor. Sirens blare as a MEDIC CHOPPER flies to the scene of the pile-up. 
MCQUEEN (REALIZES) Oh no. CUT TO: 
MILES AXLEROD - LATER. He's near the casino. He's completely surrounded, 360 degrees, by press. He's drowned out by a blizzard of questions. 
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER Sir Axlerod! Is the final race in London still going to take place? 
PULL BACK to reveal we are watching this on monitors in the PRIVATE CASINO ROOM with the Lemonheads, Zundapp and Mater. 
MILES AXLEROD (ON TV) I suppose that... Look, "the show must go on" as they say. But now is not the time to talk about... 
J. CURBY GREMLIN I can't believe this is really happening. 
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV Shh, quiet! 
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (ON TV) And Allinol? Will you require all the racers to still run on Allinol? 
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV Here it comes. 
On Miles Axlerod: He's devastated. 
MILES AXLEROD (ON TV) I cannot in good conscience continue to risk the lives of any more race cars. The final race will not be run on Allinol. 
WILD WHOOPING CHEERS fill the room. Lemonade corks are popped. 
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (ON TV) There you have it. A clearly devastated Sir Miles Axlerod announcing that he will not require the cars to use Allinol for the final race. 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP A toast! To the death of Allinol and alternative fuel forever! 
EXT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS 
Holley is already on the run. Speeding away. 
HOLLEY Mater. Abort the mission. They've got Finn. Get out of there. Get out of there right now! 
She turns a corner and STOPS. 
Her escape is now blocked by the same HUGO THUGS she tricked before. Another vehicle appears BEHIND HER, LOOMS. 
IVAN THE TOW TRUCK How is your grandfather? 
INT. PRIVATE ROOM - CASINO - CONTINUOUS 
The Lemonheads celebrate, chant "Long live lemons!" Mater, scared, turns to leave. He's stopped by ALEXANDER HUGO. 
ALEXANDER HUGO Isn't this a great party, Ivan? 
MATER Oh yeah, it's unbelievable. 
ALEXANDER HUGO You are not leaving, are you? 
JUST OFF THE PRESS STAGE - McQueen is led toward the exit. 
PRESS LIAISON Right this way, signore. 
MATER (O.S.) (DISTANT) McQueen! 
MCQUEEN Mater? 
McQueen looks up but can only see A SEA OF VEHICLES, flashbulbs, cameras, TV trucks with those tall satellite antennae things that spindle toward the sky... 
BACK AT THE SECURITY BARRICADE - Mater, like a nimble running back, dances around to avoid capture by security. 
MATER McQueen! 
ITALIAN SECURITY #1 Back up, sir. Stop moving! Stop! 
Mater head fakes them and pushes through, into the crowd --- 
ITALIAN SECURITY #1 Oy! Stop! Ferma li! 
IN THE CROWD - Mater shoves his way through. He's still far in the back. 
MATER McQueen! 
ON MCQUEEN 
MCQUEEN That really sounded like Mater. Mater? 
PRESS LIAISON (TO MCQUEEN) Signore... 
ON MATER, getting CLOSER... 
MATER McQueen, they're gonna kill you!! 
ON MCQUEEN - Okay, he's positive that was his friend, but where is he? 
MCQUEEN Mater?! 
McQueen spots a TOW HOOK, moving through the crowd toward him, "Jaws"-like. 
MCQUEEN Excuse me. 
McQueen disappears into the press crowd. 
PRESS LIAISON No, no, where are you going? Please, Mr. McQueen! 
McQueen pushes through the press. 
MCQUEEN Scusi. Mater! Scusi... 
McQueen tracks the tow hook, gets closer. He pushes through the last few vehicles --- 
MCQUEEN Mater, I'm so glad to see you. I'm so sorr --- 
It's NOT MATER. It's IVAN, the Hugo Thug's tow truck. 
IVAN THE TOW TRUCK Lightning McQueen! I am a huge fan. 
MCQUEEN (CONFUSED) Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I heard--- 
IVAN THE TOW TRUCK Yes, but that was me. I said, "You killed out there today." You're the best. 
MCQUEEN What? Oh. I mean, thanks. 
PRESS LIAISON Right this way, signore --- 
Now the Press Liaison and his assistants are pushing McQueen back in the other direction --- 
MCQUEEN (as he's pulled away) I really thought I heard my friend. 
As he's pulled away, press and onlookers start to come between him and Ivan, who hasn't moved. 
IVAN THE TOW TRUCK (TO MCQUEEN) In England you'll be finished. At the finish line. 
Ivan is now obscured again. 
MCQUEEN Wait, what? 
The ITALIAN PRESS being to swarm. 
PRESS LIAISON Please, the world press is waiting. You come with me, please. 
McQueen is pulled back --- 
EXT. STREET - PORTO CORSA - MOMENTS LATER 
--- just as Mater, now BOUND and with HIS MOUTH TAPED, is pulled away and thrown into the back of a transport vehicle. He lands hard on his side, spits out his TAPE. 
MATER Let me go! 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP You actually care about that race car. A pity you didn't warn him in time. 
As the doors close on Mater --- PHHHHHSSSSSSTTTTTTT! A thick, noxious gas starts to fill the truck. 
On MATER as the knockout gas works its magic. HIS EYES CLOSE. CUT TO: 
BLACK SCREEN. 
MATER (V.O.) Idiot? Is that how you see me? 
FINN (V.O.) That's how everyone sees you. I tell you, that's the genius of it. 
FADE IN on Mater, back at the Casino, eyeing his reflection in the glass window. It's the same moment from before except now we are watching it from a DETACHED, FLOATING PERSPECTIVE. 
Finn and Holley take this in. 
HOLLEY Finn, he's not joking. 
FINN I know. 
MATER You were right, Finn. I'm a fool. And what's happened to McQueen is `cause I'm such a big one. This is all my fault. 
GREM and ACER arrive on a lift, roll into view on a catwalk. 
GREM Good, you're up! 
ACER And just in time! 
GREM Professor Z wanted you to have a front row seat for the death of Lightning McQueen. 
MATER (HOPEFUL) He's still alive? 
Acer whips a sheet away, revealing the WGP CAMERA, turns it toward the clock face. 
ACER Not for much longer. 
He pushes the camera through an open small window, turns it toward the course. Mater DROPS down again --- 
FINN and HOLLEY CLICK FORWARD. 
EXT. LONDON - DAY 
Big Bentley's big hand CLICKS ahead another minute. But we're a bit farther away from it than before. 
SALLY (O.S.) We came as soon as you called. 
INT. MCQUEEN'S PIT - LONDON 
Sally, flanked by Red, Flo and Ramone, are in front of ---- 
--- McQueen and the rest of the team. 
MCQUEEN I called to talk to Mater. It never occurred to me that he wouldn't be there. 
RAMONE Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard right now. 
FLO And Sarge is in touch with his friends in the British military. 
SALLY You just need to focus on the race. 
MCQUEEN I know, but Sal, with everything going on I'm not sure I should--- 
A HORN O.S. Someone's entering the pit. Everyone parts, revealing MILES AXLEROD. 
MCQUEEN Sir Axlerod. 
MILES AXLEROD I'm sorry to interrupt. 
MCQUEEN No, no, it's all right. 
MILES AXLEROD I just wanted to come down here and personally thank you. Because after Italy, I was finished. And then you gave me one last shot. 
MCQUEEN Listen, I --- 
MILES AXLEROD And I probably shouldn't be saying this at all but... I hope you win today. Show the world that they've been wrong about Allinol. 
McQueen takes this in. He looks at Sally. 
SALLY Mater would want you to race. 
MCQUEEN All right. For Mater. 
EXT. THE STARTING GRID - MOMENTS LATER 
TIRES SQUEAL --- 
MCQUEEN, FRANCESCO and the other racers PEEL OUT --- 
We PAN UP to reveal the LEMONHEADS watching from a VIP box. 
EXT. RACE COURSE - LONDON - DAY 
McQueen leads Francesco as they approach Big Bentley... 
INT. BIG BENTLEY - LONDON - CONTINUOUS 
GREM Here he comes! 
Grem turns up the juice to the HIGHEST, DEATH-INDUCING LEVEL. 
Holley and Finn watch, helpless. Mater closes his eyes. 
Grem ZAPS MCQUEEN. 
EXT. RACE COURSE - LONDON 
McQueen SPEEDS PAST Big Bentley, unharmed. Oblivious to what was supposed to have just happened. 
INT. BIG BENTLEY - LONDON 
Zundapp suddenly SQUAWKS over the radio. 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (OVER RADIO) What happened!? 
GREM I don't know, Professor. 
ACER What did you do? 
HOLLEY Trying to turn back time. If I can just reverse the polarity... 
She FIRES them again. Direct hit! 
Holley JUICES the gearbox with HIGH VOLTAGE. The CLOCK STOPS. It reverses itself. 
Finn and Holley's wheel now rotates AWAY from danger. 
FINN Good job! Quick thinking, Holley! 
EXT. LONDON - CONTINUOUS 
BIG BENTLEY, visible from street level, now moves BACKWARDS. Fast. CRANE DOWN TO --- 
--- Mater, speeding toward the track, unaware. 
MATER What's everybody on the wrong side of the road for?! 
INT. BIG BENTLEY - CONTINUOUS 
Finn and Holley are now moving in the opposite direction, toward ANOTHER GEAR! And it's going MUCH FASTER. They're seconds from a crushing death... 
HOLLEY Oh no! 
FINN Drive! 
They both DRIVE, fast as they can with FULL FORCE --- 
FINN Burn rubber!! 
They drive HARDER, separating bumpers with just enough room for the descending gear to SNAP THEIR ROPES! 
Their tires spinning, they both LAUNCH off in opposite directions, LAND HARD on opposing platforms. As Finn squeals around to Holley's side of the clock: 
FINN We've got to get to the course. Calculate the fastest way to --- 
Holley pops WINGS out of her side. 
HOLLEY Done. 
FINN (IMPRESSED) Miss Shiftwell. 
HOLLEY They're standard issue now. 
FINN You kids get all the good hardware. 
They turn to leave when they STOP, see SOMETHING. It's an AIR FILTER on the ground. 
HOLLEY Oh no. That's Mater's. 
FINN I knew his escape was too easy. 
EXT. BIG BENTLEY - LONDON 
Finn BURSTS out the front doors of Big Bentley, speeds off as HOLLEY SMASHES through the clock face, careens into view flying over the traffic --- 
INT. PIT ROW - TRACK SIDE - DAY 
Mater bursts through the security gate with aplomb, tears through the pits and stops at MCQUEEN'S. 
LUIGI Mater! 
MATER Everybody get out! Get out now! Y'all gotta get out the pits! 
The ENTIRE RADIATOR SPRINGS GANG is here. 
MATER Hey, what are you guys doing here? 
SALLY We're here because of you, Mater. 
FLO Is everything okay? 
MATER No! Everything's not okay! There's a bomb in here! Y'all gotta get out! Now! 
EVERYONE - A bomb? - Huh? - Woah. 
FINN (OVER RADIO) Mater! 
MATER (INTO RADIO) Finn! You're okay! 
EXT. LONDON STREETS - CONTINUOUS 
FINN Mater, listen to me. The bomb is on you. 
ON HIS REARVIEW DISPLAY: We can see that a BOMB has been detected, anchored to Mater's air filter. 
FINN They knew you'd try to help McQueen. When we were knocked out they planted it in your air filter. 
INT. MCQUEEN'S PIT - CONTINUOUS 
Mater SNORTS, blowing his air filter cover off. Cross-eyed, Mater sees the explosive device attached to him. He looks up: 
An ALLINOL CONTAINER hangs ominously over his head. 
MATER Uh-oh. 
MCQUEEN Mater! There you are! 
Mater turns. McQueen enters Pit Row, 100 yards away and closing in FAST. 
MATER Stop right there! 
MCQUEEN Oh man, I've been so worried about you! CUT TO: 
Zundapp is still furiously hitting the button as Holley drops into view just beyond the glass. 
Freaked, Zundapp does a 180 and SMASHES out a plate glass window, lands on a ridiculously large balloon tethered to the ground, and speeds off --- 
INT. ADJACENT LUXURY BOX - CONTINUOUS 
The LEMONHEADS watch, baffled, as Zundapp drives away. 
J. CURBY GREMLIN The Professor's on the run. 
TUBBS PACER Someone's gotta get McQueen. 
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV Get McQueen!! 
Grem and Acer are already out the door --- 
EXT. SIDE STREET - SAME 
Finn speeds into view, in time to see Zundapp turn a corner out of sight. 
FINN Holley. I'll get Zundapp, you help Mater. 
EXT. TRACK - SAME 
Holley, still in the air, turns --- 
HOLLEY Got it! 
FARTHER UP THE TRACK - Holley THUNDERS past Francesco and out of sight. 
FRANCESCO What is happening?! 
EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - SAME 
Finn screams around a corner, sees --- 
--- Professor Zundapp, speeding toward docks along the Thames where a COMBAT SHIP waits. 
COMBAT SHIP Hurry, Professor! 
ON ZUNDAPP - With Finn gaining fast, he accelerates. Suddenly --- WHAP! 
He's been TETHERED by Finn with tensile cables now attached to his rear end. Zundapp SCREAMS like a little girl. 
FINN Do you really think I'm going to let you float away, Professor? 
Finn reels him in. Zundapp spins his wheels, caught. 
Suddenly Zundapp miraculously, inconceivably, GAINS TRACTION! Now it's FINN'S WHEELS that are spinning. 
ON THE COMBAT SHIP - the ELECTROMAGNET has been turned outward and switched on. He's PULLING ZUNDAPP AND FINN IN with the magnetic force. He pulls out a laser, TARGETS it at Finn's windshield. CUT TO: 
EXT. LONDON STREETS - SAME 
Mater, still towing McQueen, rockets around a corner, zips down another street --- 
MATER McQueen, let go! 
MCQUEEN Never! 
They pass a Gremlin with a headset. 
ON GREM AND ACER - Down another side street. They get this message, take off in the opposite direction. 
CUT BACK TO: 
EXT. DOCKS NEAR THE THAMES - CONTINUOUS 
FINN, tires squealing, loses more and more ground to the boat. Zundapp, the "rope" in this tug-of-war, buckles under the tension. 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Give it up, McMissile! 
Finn releases a mess of bullets, grenades, and other weaponry into the air --- 
THE MAGNET SUCKS it in quickly like a black hole --- 
THUNK! It all sticks to the magnet, right next to Finn's bullets. They're BOMBS, GRENADES, ROCKETS and one little detonator with a flashing, beeping light. 
Off the boat's RXN --- CUT TO: 
ANOTHER PART OF LONDON, AT STREET LEVEL 
KA-BOOOOOOM! A distant explosion (miles away) festoons into the air, visible over the rooftops. Holley suddenly WINGS into view. She sees --- 
Mater and McQueen, speeding up the street. 
HOLLEY Mater, stop! 
MATER No way! You could get hurt! 
Then she looks over, catches a glimpse of GREM AND ACER, bearing down on them from a side street. They're going to broadside Mater and McQueen. 
HOLLEY Oh no. 
ON MATER AND MCQUEEN - They're not aware of the impending impact. 
Holley DROPS FROM THE SKY, hits the pavement, SKIDS into the path of the AMCs and DEFLECTS THEM. They FLIP OVER Holley, Finn and McQueen and sail --- 
--- INTO A PUB --- 
--- where they skid across the room and SLAM into the bar, knocking a ROW OF BEER MUGS to the ground. 
IN THE PUB - MOMENTS LATER 
Mater KARATE CHOPS lemons, three and four at a time. 
Ramone SPRAY PAINTS a lemon's windshield. 
TUBBS PACER Retreat! 
A few Lemons turn back the way they came. BLOCKING THEIR PATH are a line of BRITISH MILITARY VEHICLES clad in digital camo, led by SARGE. 
SARGE Thanks for the help, Corporal. 
BRITISH CORPORAL Anything for one of pop's mates. 
And in the middle of all of this craziness we CUT TO --- 
--- MATER. WRENCH BITS are strewn all around him as Guido tries wrench after wrench to take the bolts off. No dice. Guido gestures wildly, spits Italian a mile a minute. 
MCQUEEN What's he saying?! What's wrong!? 
LUIGI None of his wrenches fit the bolts! 
This is a light bulb moment for Mater. He eyes the bolts. 
MATER I get it. I get it! I know what needs to be done. 
MCQUEEN Then do it! 
MATER What? No, I can't do it. Look, nobody takes me seriously. I know that now. This ain't Radiator Springs. 
MCQUEEN Yes it is. 
Mater looks at McQueen. It is? 
MCQUEEN You're yourself in Radiator Springs. Be yourself here. And if people aren't taking you seriously, then they need to change. Not you. I know that, because I was wrong before. Now you can do this. You're the bomb. 
MATER Thanks, buddy. 
MCQUEEN No no no, you're the actual bomb. Now let's go! 
MATER Oh, right! Hang on! 
Mater HOOKS McQueen and they're off. 
They SHOOT PAST FINN, who's in the middle of battling lemons. 
FINN Where's he going? 
ON MATER AND MCQUEEN - Flying down a side street. 
MATER Computer! 
MATER'S COMPUTER Yes, Agent Mater. 
MATER I need that thing you done before to get me away from McQueen! 
MATER'S COMPUTER Request acknowledged. 
The ROCKET THRUSTERS kick in. They head right for a WALL. 
MCQUEEN Mater... 
MATER Now I need you to do the chute, the second kind not the first! 
MATER'S COMPUTER Deploying chute. 
Mater's chute POPS OPEN, catching air and sending Mater and McQueen SAILING INTO THE AIR. 
Mater starts to steer them the direction he wants. He and McQueen are FLYING OVER LONDON. 
EXT. BALCONY - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY 
The QUEEN, her attendants, assorted dignitaries are here. 
QUEEN Who's winning the race? 
Mater and McQueen drop from the sky. They land and skid to a halt just before the Queen's guards who DRAW THEIR WEAPONS. 
QUEEN'S GUARD Back up! Back away! 
QUEEN (STAR-STRUCK) It's Lightning McQueen! 
QUEEN'S GUARDS Get back! 
MCQUEEN No, no, it's okay! Tell them, Mater. Explain. 
MATER Okay! Somebody's been sabotaging the racers and hurting the cars and I know who. Oh wait... Your Majesty. 
Mater BOWS to the Queen. In doing so, the TICKING TIME BOMB angles into view. The clock's at T-minus 1:53. 
QUEEN'S GUARDS - Bomb! - It's a bomb! - Everybody down! - Look out! 
FINN (O.S.) Hold your fire! He can't disarm it! 
Finn dives onto the platform and rolls between the Queen and Mater. 
FINN Mater, I don't know what you're doing but stand down now! 
MATER (aside, to McQueen) This ain't nothing at all like Radiator Springs. 
MCQUEEN Mater, just cut to the chase! 
MATER Okay. 
He turns to Miles Axlerod. 
LORD STEWARD Your Majesty. May I present for the investiture of honorary Knighthood of the British Realm. Tow Mater of Radiator Springs. 
MCQUEEN Go get `em, buddy. 
McQueen joins his friends from Radiator Springs. Mater rolls forward. He bows, as if he's practiced it all day. 
QUEEN I hereby dub thee "Sir Tow Mater." 
Applause from all around. 
MATER (LOOKS UP) "Sir?" Shoot, you can just call me Mater, Your Majesty. I don't wanna hear none of this "Sir" business. By the way, have y'all met each other? Queen? McQueen. McQueen, Queen. McQueen? McMissile. (MORE) 
MATER (CONT'D) McMissile, McQueen. Queen? McMissile. 
He continues introducing everyone as we CUT TO --- 
EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY 
The town sign now reads "WELCOME TO RADIATOR SPRINGS - HOME OF LIGHTNING MCQUEEN AND SIR TOW MATER." 
EXT. FLO'S - DAY 
Cars surround Mater and McQueen. The rest of the Radiator Springs gang is here too, watches. VAN and MINNY are front and center. 
MATER So there I was: rocket jets going full blast, McQueen hanging on for dear life when suddenly them two nasty lemons come out of nowhere, guns drawed. We was goners. But then out of nowhere, this beautiful spy car swoops in from the sky to save us! 
MINNY That's a very entertaining story, young man. 
VAN Oh, Minny, please. Come on, none of this happened. Rocket jets? Flying spy cars? 
HOLLEY No, you're quite right. It does sound a bit far-fetched. 
The crowd turns, sees HOLLEY, wings out, swooping in. FINN is right below her, driving up the street. 
MATER Holley! Finn! 
HOLLEY Hello, Mater. It's so nice to see you again. 
MATER What're you doing here? 
FINN Our satellites picked up an urgent communique. 
LUIGI So you got my e-mail. 
MATER Oh, man. Y'all is gonna have a great time. Everybody! This here's Finn McMissile. He's a secret agent. (WHISPERS) Don't tell nobody. And this is Holley Shiftwell. She's --- 
HOLLEY I'm Mater's girlfriend. It's so nice to meet you all. 
Everyone is shocked. Including Mater. Guido's jaw drops. 
LUIGI (TO MATER) Guido believe you now. 
FLO (TO HOLLEY) Whoa, honey. You got a nasty dent there. 
Indeed, Holley still wears the dent from when she saved Mater from Grem and Acer. 
VAN (already crushing on her) Was that from when you swooped in and saved them in London? 
MINNY Van! 
VAN What? I'm just asking. 
FLO (TO HOLLEY) Don't you worry, sweet pea. My baby Ramone can get that fixed up for you in no time. 
RAMONE Yeah, sure thing. No problemo. Just let me go get my tools. 
HOLLEY Oh no no. I'm keeping that dent. It's way too valuable. 
Mater takes this in. 
LIZZIE A "valuable" dent? Oh, she's as crazy as Mater. 
MACK Those two are perfect for each other. 
MCQUEEN You know, there's one thing I still don't get. The bad guys hit me with the beam from the camera, right? So why didn't I, you know... 
MATER Explode in a fiery inferno? 
MCQUEEN Yeah. 
FINN We couldn't figure that one out either. 
HOLLEY Our investigation proved that Allinol was actually gasoline. And Miles Axlerod engineered it so that when it got hit by the beam it would explode. 
MCQUEEN Wait a second. Fillmore, you said my fuel was safe. 
McQueen turns to Fillmore. Everyone does. 
FILLMORE If you're implying that I switched out that rotgut excuse for alternative fuel with my all- natural, sustainable, organic biofuel just because I never trusted Axlerod, you're dead wrong, man. (RE: SARGE) It was him. 
SARGE Once Big Oil, always Big Oil. Man. 
FILLMORE Tree hugger. 
EXT. MAIN STREET - LATER 
A banner says "Radiator Springs Grand Prix." 
SHERIFF rolls up the street. 
SHERIFF The Radiator Springs Grand Prix is about to begin! All spectators clear the starting line! 
MCQUEEN heads up Main Street, other racers following.

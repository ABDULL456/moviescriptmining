FADE IN: 
A big dramatic crescendo as we -- 
OPEN ON: 
EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - SUNSET - AERIAL 
Friday night traffic as usual. Things appear to be backed up all the way to the valley. A cacophony of car horns rise up on the soundtrack as we slowly DISSOLVE INTO: 
INT.  FORD EXPLORER - NIGHT 
A new 99' Explorer sits in the midst of the gridlock. Behind the wheel is hot teen heartthrob and Hollywood everybody BEN DAMON. Ben is handsome, studly, in his early 20s. However, aside from being just another pretty face in the city of angels he's also a cocky, arrogant prick. Ben's in the middle of a heated argument on his cell with his Agent, Cathy. 
BEN (into cell) God dammit Cathy I have no time for this crap! I'm supposed to be at the premiere of STAB 2 right Now, arm and arm with my girlfriend cause she's got a bit part in that over advertised piece of shit and I'm just going to humor her. You mena to tell me that in all your squandering the best you can do for me is A bit role in STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO?! Come on! It's just another cheap slasher flick! How dare you offer me such a role! I've done Shakespeare! I've worked with directors like DePalma and Scorcesse and you offer me this crap?! It's insulting. I should fire you and go to ICM. 
CATHY(O.S.) (off phone) Ben, I will not sit around and listen to you bad mouth me! Without me you would've never gotten as famous as you are today. The least you can do is show me a little god damn respect. 
BEN (into phone) You want Respect, Cathy? Here's your respect. FUCK YOU! You're fired. (Ben hangs up) Unfucking believable. 
Ben socks the steering wheel out of frustration. The horn blares uncomfortably. 
BEN Stab 3: Return To Woodsboro. Pah. What's next, Friday The 13TH PART 15: JASON DOES BROADWAY? 
Ben's phone rings. He answers it. BEN (into phone) What's up, B.D. with the B.D. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (off phone) Hardly as large as I'd like it to be. 
BEN Christine? 
CHRISTINE(O.S.) No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes. 
BEN Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly, (checks watch) Eight thirty. 
CHRISTINE(O.S.) All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut. 
BEN (putting up faux-enthusiasm) Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job. 
CHRISTINE(O.S.) I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie. 
BEN Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . . But of course, we notice Ben's battery is fine, he's just trying to cut the conversation short. 
CHRISTINE(O.S.) Alright Hon, talk to you when the lights go down. 
Ben smiles. 
BEN Sure thing. 
Ben hangs up. He reclines back in his seat. Camera slowly pans out the windshield revealing the huge traffic pile up awaiting him. He's not going anywhere. 
CLOSE ON GLOVE COMPARTMENT. 
VOICE You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies. 
BEN I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you! 
VOICE Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2? 
Ben groans. He bangs his head against the steering wheel, if only  he'd have paid attention to Christine he might have known this. 
VOICE Come on. Don't you know? 
BEN (hesitating) It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie! 
VOICE Very good. Now we play ROUND 2. 
BEN What?! But I did everything you said to do! 
VOICE That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting. 
BEN What?! 
VOICE Good bye Ben. Click. The killer hangs up. Ben flips open the phone, dials 911. Ringing and then . . . 
RECORDED MESSAGE (off phone) Due to the high volume of calls this evening, Dispatch is temporarily shut down. If this is not a real emergency please call another dep- 
Ben hangs up, dials CHRISTINE's number. RINGING, then-- 
VOICE You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live? 
BEN I swear to God if you lay one hand on her! 
VOICE No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand? 
IN THE B.G. we hear CHRISTINE's horrific screaming. 
The killer hangs up. Ben looks ahead, traffic is picking up. He puts the SUV into gear, peels out the nearest opening, narrowly avoiding collision. His car screeches down the off ramp. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT 
Ben comes screeching around the corner in his FORD EXPLORER.  Tires smoking. Sparks flying. The HOLLYWOOD sign stands like an impending pall in the awaiting b.g. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT 
The SUV comes to a screeching halt alongside the hilly, narrow road. Ben jumps out of his car, cell phone in hand. He looks up at the towering sign standing ahead of him, contemplates. Does he really wanna go up there? He looks into his SUV, gets an idea. 
THE BACK -- 
--is opened. Ben reaches in looking for a weapon. AN OLD BEACH CHAIR. Not gonna do the trick. A pair of old shoes. Nope. Then he finds it, a LOUISVILLE SLUGGER with "ACTORS AT BAT FOR BRAIN CANCER" written across it. 
BEN (to himself) Thank God I decided to do some community service. 
Ben takes the bat, closes up the back of the SUV. He begins to walk towards the sign when suddenly -- 
HIS CELL RINGS. 
Ben answers the call. 
Roman smiles. The true costumed horror film buffs in the audience break into applause. Gale, somewhat distracted, other what not caring what this second rate director has to say, gazes at a costumed individual at the far corner of the set, watching from a half-open exit door. Now it could be just her imagination running away with her and her atmosphere but it almost appears as if the figure is pantomiming slitting his throat with a gleaming blade. 
A LOUD BUZZING O.S.  Gale is startled out of her skin. She looks up at a sign hanging over the stage. THE WORD "COMMERCIAL BREAK" is illuminated in flashing red light. Gale sighs, looks back to the exit. The GHOST is gone. She turns to Roman. 
GALE Would you excuse me for a moment? 
ROMAN (smiling) Sure. 
Gale bolts for -- 
INT.  BACKSTAGE - TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT SET - DAY 
Gale races around the corner of the set, smashing right into - 
DETECTIVE MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D. Mid-thirties. Handsome with piercing eyes. He grabs Gale by her shoulders, shepherding her aside. 
GALE Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me. DETECTIVE KINCAID I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D. (flashes badge) Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS? 
GALE Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI. 
DETECTIVE KINCAID Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films. 
GALE So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in? 
DETECTIVE KINCAID I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note. 
GALE A note? 
Detective Kincaid reaches into his back pocket, pulls up a newspaper clipping in a ziplock evidence bag. He holds the bag up For Gale to see. 
EXTREMELY CLOSE on the ARTICLE . . . "MAUREEN PRESCOTT, MOTHER AND WIFE, FOUND BRUTALLY RAPED AND MURDERED IN BEDROOM". A b/w photo of Sidney's mother Maureen stands hauntingly before the camera. 
GALE(O.S.) That's Sidney Prescott's mother. 
DETECTIVE KINCAID(O.S.) There's more. 
Kincaid flips the article over. Someone has scrawled in black marker across the back "SIDNEY". 
DETECTIVE KINCAID I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger. 
GALE I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, (gale hesitates), not going to talk. 
DETECTIVE KINCAID And who would that be? 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS BACK LOT - DAY 
A red BMW convertible speeds through the back lot. Behind the wheel is DEWEY RIELLY. Former Police Officer, turned Technical advisor on the red hot set of . . . STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO. 
All around the lot are promotional banners and posters for the film. Dewey parks his car outside a soundstage, exits. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  STAB 3 SET - DAY 
A huge replication of Woodsboro in a building about the size of an airplane hanger.  In one corner we've got the Macher and Prescott homes. In another corner stands the infamous Becker house where the nightmare all began. In other regions are sights like the Town Square and Market, an exterior for the Woodsboro Police Station,  A TOP STORY news van, etc. 
DEWEY, Enters set, bumping into his movie alter-ego -- 
Totally repulsed, Angelina gets up, races off set. 
TOM Talk about moody. 
Tom leans back seductively, his crotch in full view, staring at Sarah with bedroom eyes. 
TOM And how about you good looking? Got any plans for later? 
SARAH Eww yeah, finding a guy to have sex with that doesn't look like you. 
Sarah, following suit laid by Angelina, scampers off set. Tom looks up at Tyson, smoke blowing out his nostrils. 
TYSON Oh no. I ain't into that shit. 
Tyson races off set. Tom laughs, covers his face. 
CUT TO: 
DETECTIVE KINCAID AND GALE. 
They walk through the set. Gale's mesmerized. Kincaid is all business. 
GALE Déjr vu-do. 
The pair come to a halt on the driveway of what is supposed to be the Macher Residence. Everything from the smashed beer bottles in the garage, to the boat on the driveway is mimicked to a perfect t. Even a foam dummy Of TATUM RIELLY dangles from the doggy door, head squashed a bloody mess. 
GALE stares at the swaying dummy, haunted. 
VOICE(O.S.) Well well, someone dies and Gale Weathers comes running. What a shock. 
GALE looks up. DEWEY stands beside her. 
DETECTIVE KINCAID Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events? 
DEWEY Yeah. A real tragedy. 
Dewey stares daggers through Gale. There is a real bitter coldness between the two. 
GALE Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is. 
DEWEY What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale. 
GALE (to Kincaid) Show him. 
DETECTIVE KINCAID Mr. Rielly, this was found alongside the bodies of Ben and his girlfriend. 
Kincaid hands Dewey the ziplocked clipping. Dewey examines it, his fear slowly growing. 
DEWEY I promised Sid I'd keep her in seclusion. I promised her nobody would ever find her. If you don't mind Detective, I'd like to approach her with this on my own and see what she'd like to do about it. 
Kincaid nods. 
DETECTIVE KINCAID That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant. 
DEWEY Understood. (a beat) If you'll excuse me Detective. (coldly) Gale. 
Dewey walks off camera. Kincaid puts his hand on Gale's shoulder. 
DETECTIVE KINCAID I'm going to have a little chat with the producers. Don't wander off. I may need you. 
ON THE TV -- 
A REPORTER stands with the HOLLYWOOD SIGN in the b.g. 
REPORTER The mutilated bodies were discovered late last night by the L.A.P.D, prominent actor Ben Damon was slated for a role in the upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO -- 
Sidney shuts off the TV as a familiar voice cuts through the din: 
VOICE Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you? 
SIDNEY W-what do you want? 
VOICE I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game. 
SIDNEY You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass! 
VOICE (laughs coldly) Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott. 
SIDNEY (tears welling) No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did. 
VOICE Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT. 
SIDNEY The final act? Well let's play asshole! 
VOICE No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly. 
The killer laughs coldly. Sidney wanes. 
SIDNEY (crying) If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you! 
VOICE Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon. 
Click. The killer hangs up. Sid's left trembling. She rips the headset out of the phone, reaches into her desk for a loaded.38 special.  She stands up, and peers out her office window. 
SIDNEY'S P.O.V. - THE DARK, OMINOUS NIGHT. 
CUT TO: EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS - NIGHT 
Sarah Darling drives through the main gates in her porshe, rounds a corner. 
EXT.  STAB 3 PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT 
Sarah parks outside the production offices, gets out of her car. 
KILLER'S P.O.V - watching from the rooftop, Sarah approaching the dimly lit offices. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  STAB 3 PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT 
Sarah steps into the office. It's desolate. Silent. All over the place are promotional items (standees, posters, banners) for STABS 1-3. Sarah passes a big cardboard GHOST. 
SARAH STAB 3. Oh God I've gotta get myself a better agent. 
Sarah walks down a hallway. 
SARAH (calling out) Anybody home? 
Sarah passes Roman Bridger's office. It's half-open. 
SARAH Who's this? 
ROMAN Who's this? 
SARAH This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering? 
ROMAN Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple? 
SARAH Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number. 
ROMAN But you know my favorite name? 
SARAH I'm hanging up right now. 
ROMAN It's Sarah. 
SARAH Roman that's not the line. 
ROMAN It is in my script. 
SARAH Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes? 
ROMAN It's not just a new script, it's a new movie. 
SARAH What?  What movie? 
ROMAN My movie. 
A pause, then a familiar dark natured noise enters our ears, the killer's sinister voice. 
VOICE It's called, Sarah gets sliced like a fucking pig. Still in character, Sarah? 
Sarah tosses down the phone, bolts out of the office. 
INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Sarah stops in her tracks. Through the smoked glass of the front door she sees a shape approaching. She screams, spins around, runs for the prop room. 
INT.  PROP ROOM - NIGHT 
Sarah locks the door, backs up right into -- 
AN ARMY OF GHOSTS! 
AT LEAST THIRTY GHOST COSTUMES dangle from hooks on costume racks. Sarah catches her breath, dives into one of the racks.  She pulls up her cell phone, starts to dial. 
INT.  STAB 3 - PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT 
A SECURITY GUARD opens the front door, pokes his head into the offices. 
SECURITY GUARD Mr. Bridger? 
No answer. The guard nods, backs out of the offices, locking them with SARAH and the killer inside! 
CUT TO: 
INT.  PROP ROOM - NIGHT 
Sarah's waiting on eggs as a digitized pre-programmed commissarymenu for Sunrise Studios drags out. 
GALE Right. Sorry. (a beat) Do you think he did it? (RE: ROMAN) 
DEWEY (his beeper goes off) I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person. 
GALE And who is that? 
But Dewey doesn't answer. Again, he's staring daggers through Gale.  Years and years of bottled up resentment is finally surfacing. 
DEWEY Jennifer needs me. 
GALE Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to? 
DEWEY I'm on duty. 
Dewey races out the room. Gale pauses, stares at the interrogation. Wallace has reduced Roman to tears. It's pathetic. Gale bolts after Dewey. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT 
The wind rushes past the camera. A huge panoramic view of L.A.  FULL MOON hangs in the sky. A coyote howls in the near distance. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
A nice low ranch tucked away in the valley. Dewey rolls up Jennifer's driveway in his truck. Gale follows behind in her VW JETTA. 
DEWEY (noticing Gale) Stop following me. 
GALE I happen to work for the police god dammit! 
DEWEY You're not a detective. 
GALE Neither are you, Magnum P.I. 
DEWEY Gale, your engine's still running. 
GALE Fuck! 
Dewey shakes his head in disgust, disappears into the house. Gale runs back to shut off her car. From out of the bushes lunges -- 
TOM PRINZE, loaded off his ass, still holding a half-filled bottle of JOHNNY WALKER BLACK LABEL SCOTCH in his hand. 
TOM Gale Weathers. What a surprise. 
GALE Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker. 
TOM Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket. 
GALE Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings. 
TOM Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I'm here, drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself! (a beat, subtle) Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should Have a look at your break line. That your car over there? 
Gale pushes Tom's chest. Stopping him. 
GALE I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU. 
TOM (laughs) You mean what's left of us. (tosses empty bottle aside) Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel. 
Tom stops in his tracks. He looks down. Lying in a pool of blood at his feet is ANGELINA TYLER! Tom screams, staggers backwards right into the arms of -- 
THE GHOST -- 
TOM You fucker! 
The GHOST slashes open Tom's arm. Tom screams, backs up into the kitchen. The ghost grabs him by the throat, begins choking him mid-air. He slowly begins to lift him off his feet, angling the knife, readying to make the kill blow. Tom gags. He can't even scream, the killer's crushing his voice-box, causing a trickle of blood down his lips. 
TOM (gagging) Fucker! 
THE GHOST brings the knife down, piercing Tom's heart, pinning him to the closet. Tom kicks around for a moment before finally going limp. The GHOST steps back, admiring his work. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Jennifer, Gale, and Dewey are pacing around nervously. 
JENNIFER Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina? 
GALE I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen. 
DEWEY What about Sidney? 
JENNIFER What about her? 
Suddenly, a knock at the door. The three are startled. Dewey looks at the front door. 
DEWEY Ssh. Maybe it's Tom or Angelina. I'll get it. 
JENNIFER What if it's the killer? 
GALE Oh use your brain drama queen! Do the killers ever knock on the fucking door? Ever see Jason do that before burying an axe in some big titted blonde's head? Or maybe Michael or Chucky? Huh? 
Jennifer sticks her tongue out at Gale. Dewey reaches into a holster tucked away under his jacket, drawing up his 9mm. 
DEWEY Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything. 
GALE Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door! 
Dewey nods his head, slowly makes his way towards the door. Gale and Jennifer huddle together, follow close behind. 
JENNIFER Do you smell something? 
DEWEY (smirking) It's Gale. She farts when she gets nervous. 
Gale makes an angry face, slaps Dewey upside the back of his headplay fully. Dewey steps up to the front door. IT'S NOT LOCKED.  He reaches for the knob, turns it when suddenly -- 
THE POWER SIZZLES OUT! 
EVERYONE SCREAMS! 
DEWEY Alright don't panic! Just a fuse. 
Dewey throws open the door. ANGELINA'S CORPSE drops into the doorway. A SYMPHONY OF SCREAMS. 
DEWEY Hurry! Everyone out the back way! Now! 
Dewey, Gale, and Jennifer race for the French doors in the living room leading outside to the pool and backyard. A PHONE RINGS somewhere in the house. 
DEWEY OH SHIT! RUN! 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  BACKYARD - JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Jennifer, Gale, and Dewey take off out the patio doors when suddenly KA-BOOM! THE WINDOWS BLOW OUT! THE ROOF SPLINTERS. 
A HUGE CONFLAGRATION! The three dive into the swimming pool as debris rains down onto the Earth. 
THE GHOST -- 
WATCHES FROM THE SHADOWS, FLAMES BOUNCING OFF HIS PALLID WHITE MASK. 
SIRENS ARE HEARD IN THE NEAR DISTANCE. 
AS THE GHOST RUNS OFF INTO THE NIGHT, HE DROPS ANOTHER NEWSPAPER CLIPPING ON THE GROUND. IT BLOWS IN THE WIND. 
CUT TO: 
THE NEWSPAPER CLIPPING - ECU 
IT'S FLIPPED OVER BY A PAIR OF HANDS.  SCRAWLED ON BACK IS:"I KILLED HER" WE ARE: 
INT.  DETECTIVE KINCAID'S OFFICE - DAY 
DETECTIVE KINCAID paces around his room. A battered and bruised Dewey and Gale sit beside his desk in Police Uniforms (since their old clothes has obviously been drenched). 
DETECTIVE KINCAID Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder. 
GALE But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it! 
DETECTIVE KINCAID Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a third killer.  Sidney Might know something 
Kincaid's eyes appear as if questioning Dewey. 
DEWEY I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it. 
DETECTIVE KINCAID That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities. 
GALE Four? There are five. 
DETECTIVE KINCAID Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count. 
DEWEY What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too. 
DETECTIVE KINCAID Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there. 
Kincaid seems to be getting a morbid charge out of all of this. He smirks ever so nefariously at Dewey. 
GALE OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott. 
DETECTIVE KINCAID Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too. 
DEWEY/GALE (together) What? 
Kincaid holds up a second ziplocked evidence bag. Within is a blurry 5x4 of MAUREEN PRESCOTT exiting a motel room with COTTON WEARY. Kincaid turns it over. Also, written on it's back is 'I KILLED HER' 
DETECTIVE KINCAID Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point. 
GALE Thank you. 
DEWEY Sid, this is detective Kincaid. 
DETECTIVE KINCAID Nice to finally meet you, Sidney. 
DEWEY The killer called her. 
DETECTIVE KINCAID What?  When? 
GALE What'd he say? 
SIDNEY Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?" 
DEWEY Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number? 
DETECTIVE KINCAID He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set? 
DEWEY No. 
GALE Do you have her number stored in your memory? (Dewey thinks) Phone memory! 
DEWEY Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do. 
GALE Has anyone else every used your phone? 
DEWEY Just Jennifer. (To Kincaid_) And you. 
DETECTIVE KINCAID Hey, I'm the cop here.  You're in my office, Riley. 
Sidney notices the clippings and the photograph of Maureen. 
DETECTIVE KINCAID The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother. 
SIDNEY Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something? 
DEWEY I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding. 
SIDNEY Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down. 
DETECTIVE KINCAID Are you sure? 
SIDNEY Absolutely. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS BACK LOT - DAY 
Kincaid and Dewey's cars drive through the lot. They drive over towards a row of trailers, park. 
KINCAID disappears to do something else while GALE, DEWEY, and Sidney get out of Dewey's truck. 
DEWEY Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night. 
SIDNEY Mm, what a waste of Silicone. (a beat) What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro. 
A figure lunges out of nowhere, startling all three of them. It's a young, scrawny goth girl in  heavy make-up. 
This is KAREN COLCHECK, 22. She holds something in her hand, a video tape marked SCARY MOVIES 101. 
Gale runs off. 
SIDNEY I can see nothing's changed. 
DEWEY No. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIO FILM ARCHIVES - DAY 
Gale's banging on the door trying to gain access. Nobody home. Gale notices the card lock and the sign reading  'AUTHORIZED PERSONAL ONLY'. Gale smiles. Since when has this ever stopped her before. She reaches into her pocket book, pulling out a couple of credit cards, a video store card, etc. She tries them in the lock. NOTHING. 
A hand reaches down, grabs Gale from behind. She lets outa blood curdling scream. It's only JENNIFER. 
JENNIFER Geez. 
GALE What the hell are you doing? 
JENNIFER Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing? 
GALE I am Gale Weathers! 
JENNIFER Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense? 
GALE None. 
JENNIFER You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter. 
GALE And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch. 
JENNIFER That's funny. 
GALE Ha. Maybe I should join SNL. 
JENNIFER Need to get in that building? 
GALE (sarcastically) No really? 
JENNIFER There a story in that building? 
GALE Possibly. 
JENNIFER (flashing a Sunrise Studios Key Card) Gale Weathers would find a way. (she swipes and opens the door) 
Jennifer opens the door, steps in first. Gale follows, door closing ominously behind them with a loud CLACK. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BASEMENT HALLWAY - ARCHIVES - DAY 
Gale leads the way down the dark hall. 
JENNIFER Basements creep me out. 
GALE Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic. 
JENNIFER Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do. 
GALE (smiling) Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down. 
Gale takes the folder from Bianca, opens it up. Inside are 8x10 headshots of MAUREEN PRESCOTT when she was younger. Behind the pictures is a Xeroxed listing of the films she's starred in. 
GALE What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'? 
BIANCA Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday. 
GALE/JENNIFER (together) What? 
BIANCA You know, JOHN MILTON, the horror producer? Those were some of his early flicks.

EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - SUNRISE STUDIOS - DAY 
Sidney stands beside Dewey and Detective Wallace. 
SIDNEY Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom. 
DEWEY Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said? 
SIDNEY No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife. (smiles, raises up her fists) These two lethal weapons. 
DETECTIVE WALLACE Sure you don't need a police escort? That's what we're here for. 
SIDNEY No really, I'll be fine. 
Dewey and Wallace nod. Sid begins to walk towards the soundstage. 
SIDNEY I'll be right back. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  LADIES ROOM - SOUNDSTAGE BUILDING - DAY 
Sidney stands at the sink washing her face. She shuts off the water reaches for a paper towel when suddenly, something catches her ear. Almost as if a man's whisperedher name 'Siiiiiddney'. Sid turns around, stares at the empty bathroom. 
SIDNEY H-hello? Anyone there? 
Silence. Sid reaches into her pocket book, draws out a Gravity Knife. She flips open the blade, crouches down on her knees, scanning the row of stalls for feet. What a relief . . . none. Sid smiles, dismisses what she thought she heard when she sees -- 
THE RUMBLING AIR CONDITIONING UNIT. 
Sidney goes back to drying her face when suddenly -- 
MAN(O.S.) (whisper) Sidney. 
This time it's apparent. There's somebody else in the bathroom. Sid begins to make her way towards the bathroom door when suddenly -- 
WHAM! A STALL door flies open. THE GHOST charging out at full-force. Sid hits the deck, sliding across the floor, deflecting the blow from the knife as the killer buries it into the sink counter. Sid races for the door, killer hot on her trail. SUDDENLY -- 
WHAM! The storage closet door flies open and a second GHOST comes charging out, knife gleaming. He dives for Sid. Sid takes up her knife, buries it in her attacker's shoulder. The GHOST goes reeling back into the closet. Sidney slams the door closed on him. She dives for the door knob when suddenly, the first ghost comes running back at her. She ducks as he swings his knife, burying it into the bathroom door. Sid bolts across the bathroom towards a tiny window in the far corner of the ceiling. Using the trash as a booster, she leaps up, slides open the window, and dives out, just as the deadly pair of attackers come back for more. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY 
Sidney comes charging around the corner of the soundstage building. She looks up, realizing she's just ran herself into a dead end. 
SIDNEY (crying) Shit. 
DEWEY/JENNIFER (together) Agreed. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  JOHN MILTON'S OFFICE - DAY 
Milton's on the phone with Roman. 
MILTON (into phone) Roman I know you're upset. But there will be other movies. I know. Ah, VARIETY called you a Pariah? Well fuck them. I got a great script on my desk. It's called TRAGIC MENAGE TRIOS and it was written by John Sayles. I'm thinking you for Director. What? (knock at the door) Come in. (into phone) No, not to you Roman. Look I'll talk to you later. Bye. 
Milton hangs up as Gale, Jennifer, and Dewey barge intohis office. 
DEWEY So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother. 
MILTON Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio. 
GALE Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom? 
MILTON Who? 
JENNIFER Rina Reynolds. 
MILTON Do you know how many actors have worked for me? Hundreds, thousands. 
GALE Nobody said she was an actor. 
JENNIFER Good twist. 
MILTON What's your point? 
DEWEY No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call. 
MILTON I remember her!  She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter? 
JENNIFER Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER! 
GALE Settle down Beavis. (to Milton) Why don't you tell us the truth? 
MILTON What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out. 
DEWEY But you know who she was. 
MILTON When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press? 
GALE And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing? 
MILTON Get real, that would make me a suspect! 
GALE Just because you knew her? 
MILTON Yeah. 
GALE I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood? 
MILTON Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago. 
GALE Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking. 
MILTON It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards. 
SIDNEY Hey Detective?  What's your favorite scary movie? 
Detective Kincaid pauses, he leans over Sidney's chair, his penetrating eyes glaring right into hers. 
DETECTIVE KINCAID (sotto) My life. 
Kincaid exits, door slamming shut behind him. A beat, then -- 
SIDNEY Mine too. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  RECEPTION AREA - MILTON'S OFFICE - SUNSET 
Milton steps out of his office into his reception area.  Secretary's gone for the night. Milton starts out of the office, disappears. 
CLOSE ON A COAT CLOSET. 
The door creaks open. Gale, Jennifer, and Dewey emerge from the darkness. Jennifer is gagging. 
JENNIFER Oh God Gale, Dewey was right. Stop getting so nervous and you might stop causing me to gag! 
DEWEY/GALE (together) SHUT UP! 
Jennifer's quiet. 
JENNIFER I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member. 
GALE Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends. 
JENNIFER Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino? 
GALE (smacks her forehead out of frustration) Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies. (a beat) His two hands, dingus. 
DEWEY Ssh ladies. 
Dewey leans into Milton's office door, slowly opens it. Darkness spills out. The three disappear inside it. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  HALLWAY - BUILDING - NIGHT 
Milton's walking down the hallway. It's dark. Desolate. CAMERA tracks along the paisley velvet carpet as a phone rings O.S. 
IT'S MILTON'S CELL. He answers it, pushes the elevator 'up' button anxiously. 
MILTON (into phone) John Milton. 
VOICE Wanna play a game? 
MILTON Who is this? 
VOICE You tell me. You bankrolled three  movies about me. 
MILTON It's you. The saboteur whose been fucking up my movie! (a beat) I swear to God if you don't stop I'll find you and have you killed! I shut down production on that piece of shit STAB 3! We had a no talent director and the lousiest Sidney Prescott on the planet but that was besides the point! You still killed MY movie! A John Milton film! And if you ever try and cross me again you'll be sorry. My next movie is gonna be a grandiose step up from this slasher shit! It's a film written and directed by John Sayles. 
Milton's going rapid fire. 
VOICE Oh poor John. There's not gonna be another film. Well, at least not for you. 
VOICE She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together. 
SIDNEY WHERE? 
VOICE I'll call you, when you're on your way. 
Click. The killer hangs up. Sidney breaks down crying. 
SIDNEY Fuck! 
Wallace's keys rest on his desk. Sid ponders, takes them. She stands up when something inside her makes her open Wallace's drawer and dig around. She pulls up a fully loaded handgun. 
That's the ticket. She closes the drawer, slinks out the side exit. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  WALLACE'S CAR - NIGHT 
Sid speeds through rain-slicked streets. Her cellular rings. 
SIDNEY (into phone) Yeah? 
VOICE You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there. 
Click. The killer hangs up. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS LOT - NIGHT 
Sid parks Wallace's car alongside the studio gates. She gets out, stands on the hood of the car, begins to scale the wrought-iron fence. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - NIGHT 
Sidney creeps through the darkened, abandon lot. Again, her cellular rings. Again, she answers it. 
SIDNEY (into phone) Alright, I'm here. Now what? 
VOICE You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro. 
SIDNEY I thought you wanted me here? 
Click the killer hangs up. Sid pockets her phone. She looks up, and is startled out of fright.  Posted alongside the sound stageis a huge production poster for STAB 3 with a life-size GHOST wielding a big knife. Sid knows she's in the right place. The door leading inside is half-open. Sid taps the holstered gun, slowly steps into the darkness. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  STAB 3 SETS - NIGHT 
Sidney enters. She pauses. As a million things rush through her mind. To her this is like the ultimate return. Everything appears as she last remembers. Sid steps through the dark sets. Her phone rings. She answers it. 
SIDNEY (into phone) Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this. 
VOICE It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later. 
The killer hangs up. Sid pockets the phone. She walks past the MACHER GARAGE set. Instead of a foam TATUM body dangling from the doggy door, it's KINCAID'S CORPSE! Sidney flinches, covers her eyes. She walks on. 
INT.  BECKER HOUSE - SET - NIGHT 
GALE Let's get out of here! 
SIDNEY (screaming) GALE WATCHOUT! 
KER-SMASH! The GHOST launches himself through the upstairs window. Gale and Sidney bolt for the bedroom door, killer hot on their tails. 
CUT TO: 
DEWEY -- 
Dewey comes around. He lets his head loll for a moment before finally beginning to pull and tug on his bindings. 
EXTREMELY CLOSE on Dewey freeing one of his hands from the heavy duct tape. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  MAUREEN'S BEDROOM - PRESCOTT HOUSE SET - NIGHT 
Gale and Sidney run into the master bedroom set, slamming the door shut and locking it. Sid looks around, her head already swimming from the chaos outside. However, what's inside utterly horrifies her. The walls, the furniture and the bed are splattered with blood. On the bed lies a corpse in a black rubber body bag (supposedly Maureen's body). The door buckles under the killer's blows. Gale and Sidney scream. They can't hold out much longer. 
GALE Jesus Christ Sidney get out of here! He can't get us both! 
A knife splinters through the door, inches from Gale's face. She screams. 
GALE RUNNN! 
Sid backs away, hysterical. She raises up the gun, fires into the door.  BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Gale ducks out of the way. Silence. The door ceases to move. AND THEN -- 
THE BODY BAG UNZIPS and the second GHOST emerges, knife in hand. The girls utter horrified screams. Sid raises up the gun, goes to fire when suddenly -- 
BAM! 
The bedroom door's kicked down and the other killer enters, grabbing Sid by her shoulders, batting the gun from her hands. 
Sid screams, punches her attacker in the chest. He winces. 
The second Ghost grabs Gale, holds the knife to her throat, stopping her in her tracks. Sid makes a beeline for the window, leaps through the glass. 
THE WINDOW SHATTERS. 
Sid comes flying out onto the patio awning. She rolls over onto the astro-turf grass, momentarily motionless. And then she comes to. Her eyes flickering open, blurrily staring up at -- 
THE GHOST, leering out the shattered window frame. 
SID stands up, takes off running towards -- 
THE MACHER HOUSE SET. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  FOYER - MACHER HOUSE SET - NIGHT 
Sid races into the foyer, slams the door closed behind her. Again, locking and bolting it. She looks around, everything is once again the same as it was in Woodsboro. This is where the climax of the original battle between good and evil wasfought. It's déjr vu all over again.  Footsteps O.S. 
DEWEY(O.S.) (weakly) Sidney? 
Sidney turns around -- 
DEWEY staggers through the living room doorway, gun in hand. 
THE GHOST rips off his mask. IT'S ROMAN. Sidney's deathly quiet. 
ROMAN Roman Bridger, director. And brother. (a beat) She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie. 
SIDNEY All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard! 
ROMAN I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there, (Angelina smiles) She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro. 
SIDNEY (dryly) Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class? 
ANGELINA That's me Sid. I always idolized you. You were always my hero. That's why I'm here Sidney. I wanted to make you proud. 
ROMAN And I kinda keep her around cause it's a bit of a turn-on. You know, in the movies she's you Sid, so every time I jump her bones, I'm doing YOU, technically. 
SIDNEY (repulsed) Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it! 
ROMAN Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part. (pulls out tape recorder) With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice. (presses play) Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body. 
SIDNEY (off tape recorder) I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye. 
Sid squirms. 
ROMAN (clicking off tape recorder) Awesome. What'd I tell ya? Heh. Did youknow that John Milton, was my daddy? Yep, he's the one who fucked mommy dearest in the long run. His parties, his flings, exploited the Hollywood nobody! That's whyI had to make him pay. Daddy dearest is dead. Mommy's dead. Looks like I'm an orphan all alone in this world. What a good reason to -- STAB MYSELF! 
Roman stabs himself in the arm. He screams, goes stagger back into Angelina's arms. 
ROMAN See Sidney, as amateur as Billy and Stu were, they laid the groundwork for this! See Sidney, they also set the stage for you! Introducing to the world Sidney the victim! Sidney the survivor! Sidney the star! 
Roman continues stabbing himself. In the shoulder. In the side.In the leg. Bleeding and hazed, he hands the gore drenched knife to Angelina. 
ROMAN See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win! 
SIDNEY Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason! 
ANGELINA (screaming) Roman make her stop! Make her stop baby she's freaking me out! 
ROMAN (screaming) God damn it Sidney! 
Roman lunges at Sidney. Sid screams, takes off through the kitchen. Gale rolls herself off the couch. Angela runs over and kicks her in the ribs. 
GALE (coughing) Hey bitch, don't ever use prop cuffs to restrain Gale Weathers. 
Gale pops off the handcuffs. 
GALE (leaping up) I know all the tricks! 
Gale barrels into Angelina, tackling her into the coffee table before she has a chance to move. Angelina struggles to raise her knife. 
MEANWHILE -- 
ROMAN, 
--chases Sid into the foyer. She races past the spot where Dewey fell earlier. He's gone! Roman jumps at her. Sid disappears into another room.  THE CHASE continues. 
GALE AND ANGELINA, 
Continue the fight. Gale's slamming Angelina's head against the hardwood floor. Angelina swipes, slashing Gale along the side, deeply. Gale screams, begins to crawl away. She kicks Angelina in the face. Angelina drops the knife. Gale stands up, begins to back away. 
SIDNEY--

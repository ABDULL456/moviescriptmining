CARD -- 1997 FADE IN SECOND CARD -- NOW FADE OUT 1997 
EXT. STATUE OF LIBERTY SECURITY CONTROL -- NIGHT. A Jeep pulls up outside the base.  It comes to a stop and the driver pulls out a walkie-talkie. 
DRIVER This is Gotham 4, North Bay, Station 17.  I have an escape in progress. An object in mid-bay moving toward the wall. 
TILT UP -- WALL EXT. CLOSE UP -- SIGN "New York Maximum Security Penitentiary Manhattan Island" 
INT. BASE -- NIGHT Plissken and the guards follow a winding stairway down to the main floor. 
VOICE Attention.  You are now entering the debarkation area.  No talking.  No smoking.   The next scheduled departure to the prison is in two hours. You now have the option to terminate and be cremated on the premises. If you elect this option, notify the duty sergeant in your processing area. 
INT. BASE -- NIGHT EXT. CLOSE UP ON SIGN -- "No talking.  No smoking.  Follow the ORANGE line." EXT. CLOSE UP ON SNAKE.  He is not impressed. STEADICAM VIEW OF THE HALL, SNAKE'S P.O.V. Guards, guards, more guards. Who cares. 
As Snake rounds the corner: 
O.S. GUARD Hold it. 
Snake stops, turns, directs an impertinent glance at the speaker.  He's still not impressed by any of this. 
FADE OUT. FADE IN. EXT. BASE -- NIGHT Rehme waits as a limo pulls up.  Out steps BOB HAUK. 
REHME We've got a small jet in trouble, over restricted air space. 
HAUK Where is it? 
REHME Seven miles out and closing. 
The two of them walk AWAY. 
INT. BASE -- NIGHT Hauk and Rehme walk down the stairs.  They turn TOWARD US and walk into the AIR TRAFFIC ROOM.  Dozens of men sit in front of radar transmission screens, wearing headsets and working.   Following Hauk and Rehme into the room: 
INT. AIR TRAFFIC ROOM -- NIGHT 
REHME We've been on the board for the last twenty minutes.  We haven't been able to reach them.  There was a transmission ten minutes ago.  He identified as "David 14."  Then all of a sudden he was cut off. 
Hauk and Rehme stand behind a CONTROLLER. 
CONTROLLER David 14, acknowledge.  David 14, we are sending Air Rescue.  Squawk 7700, contact on 121.5. (to Hauk and Rehme) There's still no reply. (to his headset) Bayonne.  I have a mayday in restricted space. 
O.S. CONTROLLER New York, I have it. 
Hauk pulls Rehme aside. 
HAUK Who is it? 
REHME I don't know. 
PAN LEFT TO PRESIDENT. 
AGENT She's bolted the door. 
PRESIDENT Can't you shoot off the lock? 
AGENT No, sir, she's pressurized the cabin. 
PRESIDENT How about lifting the door off of the hinges? 
AGENT No, sir. 
EXT. CLOSE UP -- The President's wrist as he handcuffs his briefcase to it. 
PRESIDENT Get me to the pod. 
The President and all his advisors stand up and move to the back of the plane. 
INT. POD ROOM -- NIGHT The pod opens.  An expert attaches a locating device to the President's wrist. 
EXPERT Sir, this is a locating device to trace you if you become separated from the pod.  I'm activating it now. 
SCREENS on the pod begin to light up as the President gets into the pod. He pushes a few buttons. 
PRESIDENT God save me and watch over you all. 
EXT. BASE -- NIGHT A guard watches as Air Force One descends into New York. 
INT. BASE -- NIGHT Rehme and Hauk watch a computer simulation of the plane. 
VOICE Computer simulation tracking Air Force One. 
EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT The plane goes down. 
INT. BASE -- NIGHT EXT. CLOSE UP -- MONITORS As the plane smashes into a building, a red dot drops through the building.  It's the pod. 
O.S. MAN It's down! 
HAUK It's the escape pod. 
REHME Tell him we have to go with your plan now. 
Hauk waves him off. 
HAUK We can't wait until tomorrow.  If we have to move in and take the island, it's a last resort.  It's 8:45.  I want permission to try a rescue.  Thank you. 
INT. HAUK'S OFFICE -- NIGHT Hauk calmly arms a .45 pistol.  He looks up from his desk. 
HAUK All right. 
OVERPROTECTIVE SECURITY GUARD He's dangerous, sir. 
HAUK (with quiet confidence) I know.  I'll be OK. 
HAUK'S P.O.V. We see the silhouette of an unmistakable figure.  It's Snake Plissken all right, live and in the flesh.  The guards leave.  Snake walks into Hauk's office and sits down in the chair across from Hauk.  He raises his cuffed hands to Hauk as if to say "Take these off me, asshole," but he doesn't actually say anything.  Hauk shakes his head. 
HAUK I'm not a fool, Plissken. 
SNAKE (coooooool) Call me Snake. 
Hauk puts on his glasses and proceeds to read a file. 
HAUK S.D. Plissken.  American Lieutenant.  Special Forces Unit, Black Flight. Two Purple Hearts, Leningrad and Siberia.  Youngest man to be decorated by the President.  You robbed the federal reserve depository.  Life sentence, New York Maximum Security Penitentiary. I'm ready to kick your ass out of the world, War Hero. 
Snake could not care less.  He reaches forward with his still-cuffed right hand, picks up a cigarette, picks up a match with his left hand, strikes the match and takes a drag from his cigarette.  He lets out a calm breath and says: 
SNAKE Who are you? 
HAUK Hauk.  Police Commissioner. 
SNAKE Bob Hauk... 
HAUK Special Forces Unit.  Texas Thunder.  We heard of you, too, Plissken. 
SNAKE Why are we talking? 
HAUK I have a deal for you.  You'll receive full pardon for every criminal act committed in the United States. 
Hauk shows Snake the pardon.  Snake's eye lights up.  This is something he wants.  He's interested now, and can't hide it. 
HAUK When you come out. 
SNAKE Before. 
HAUK I told you I wasn't a fool, Plissken. 
SNAKE Call me Snake. 
INT. WEAPONS ROOM -- NIGHT Rehme talks as we PAN ACROSS a table full of weapons.  We see two guns, a belt, grenades, several pouches full of various stuff, a flashlight, a Uzi, throwing stars, and more.  Snake surveys them with a cool expression. 
REHME Some of them have cars.  They took old junkers that were left behind and converted them to steam.  We think they may also have a gasoline source in there, and power.  Greenhouses, rigged up generators.  Some areas have streetlights. The crazies.  Live in the subways.  Complete control of the underground.  They're night raiders. 
Snake's not into this.  He'll figure it out when he gets there.  He picks up a bracelet with an eagle on it. 
HAUK Tracer.  Sends a radio signal for fifteen minutes.  You push it, we can track you on radar.  Just like Leningrad.  But they added something.  A safety catch. 
Snake pushes the safety catch.  Simple enough.  And yes, there's the button.  This is familiar.  He smiles. 
INT. HALL -- NIGHT Snake has his jacket slung over his shoulder now.  He walks down the hall to the medical room with Hauk.  Rehme has disappeared. 
SNAKE Where am I landing? 
HAUK Top of the world trade center.  Only place you can land.  They won't see it, and you can take off from a free fall.  On the roof there's a service elevator.  It's still operational.  We use it to infiltrate the prison.  There's a power box.  It'll activate the elevator down to fifty.  From there on down you walk. 
Snake shrugs on his jacket.  He knows Hauk is just trying to assert his authority, and it's not working very well. 
HAUK You can locate the President by his vital signs bracelet, on his wrist. It sends out a sig pulse.  Use this. 
He hands Snake a homing device. 
HAUK Homing device.  Shows directions and distance. 
INT. MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT Snake and Hauk walk into the room.  They're met by a young medic. 
HAUK Strong antitoxin.  Stops bacteria and viral-proofs you for 24 hours. 
Snake braces himself against a table.  The medic is holding an injection-type tech gizmo. 
MEDIC Take off the jacket. 
The plane is aiming right at a building. 
HAUK How's your altitude? 
Snake calmly angles the plane up. 
INT. BASE -- NIGHT 
HAUK Plissken?  Plissken?  Plissken, what are you doing? 
INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT 
SNAKE Playing with myself.  I'm going in. 
Snake targets the World Trade Center.  He checks his instruments. 
EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT The plane comes down.  It hits hard.  Snake puts on the brakes, adds a grappling hook, and finally comes to a stop right at the edge. 
INT. BASE -- NIGHT 
HAUK Plissken?  Plissken? 
EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT Snake walks over to the elevator.  He uses the power box to get the elevator started.  He looks around, and the doors open.  He gets in the elevator.  The doors close. 
INT. BASE -- NIGHT Snake's voice comes through the radio. 
SNAKE I'm inside the World Trade Center on the 50th floor.  Just like Leningrad, Hauk. 
HAUK Is the glider intact? 
INT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT Snake stands with his walkie-talkie in the middle of the graffiti- covered building. 
SNAKE Yeah, but taking off is for shit.  I'll work it out. 
HAUK You'll have to use the east stairwell.  It'll take you a little while to get to ground level. 
Snake checks his life clock.  19:22:44. 43. 42. 
HAUK Call me when you get outside. 
CABBIE Hey!  You don't want to walk around down there, Snake! 
INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT The signal from the tracer keeps getting closer and closer.  Snake walks past a gang beating up and stripping a semi-conscious girl.  He doesn't take much notice.  He keeps going.  He sees a BUM sitting by a fire. 
BUM Hi, Chief.  Nice night.  Nice boots.  Niiiiice boots.  Hey. 
A guy tries to sneak up behind Snake.  Snake knocks him out and points his gun at the bum. 
BUM Easy now, chief.  I'm walking.  I'm walking. 
The bum walks away.  Snake keeps going.  A man beats up another man at a sink.  The beatee is wearing the President's life tracer.  Snake kicks the beater and knocks him out. 
SNAKE Mr. President . . . 
The man wearing the life tracer looks up and smiles.  He's a DRUNK. 
DRUNK I'm the President?  Sure, I'm the President.  If I knew where I got this thing -- (indicates the tracer) I'd be the President. 
SNAKE Where did you get it? 
DRUNK I woke up, and there it was, just like a miracle . . . 
Snake slams the tracer against the sink. 
INT. BASE -- NIGHT The President's life signs all fail. 
OFFICIAL Oh my god . . . 
MEDIC It . . . It may be just an impact on the mechanism itself . . . 
INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT Snake pulls up his walkie-talkie. 
SNAKE Hauk?! 
INT. BASE -- NIGHT 
HAUK I'm right here, Plissken. 
SNAKE I don't know who you assholes are looking at, but it's NOT the President. 
SNAKE I'm GONNA ask you.  Now where's the President? 
CABBIE The Duke's got him!  Everyone knows the Duke's got him!  You don't have to put a gun to my head.  I'll tell you! 
SNAKE Who's the Duke? 
CABBIE The DUKE!  The Duke of New York!  A-Number-1!  The big man, that's who! 
SNAKE I want to meet this Duke. 
CABBIE You can't meet the Duke, are you crazy?  Nobody wants to meet the Duke! You meet him once and then you're dead! 
Snake points the gun more insistently.  Tough. 
EXT. BRAIN'S BUILDING -- NIGHT Cabbie parks the cab and he and Snake walk up to Brain's building. 
CABBIE I hate to leave her on the street.  Usually I don't leave her alone at all.  But you're a special case, Snake. 
He and Snake walk up to the door.  Cabbie knocks on the door with his shoe. 
CABBIE It's OK, Snake.  It's a better neighborhood.  You can relax. 
Relax?  Snake checks his life clock.  17:40:46. 45. 44.  Relax, my ass. 
SNAKE Thanks. 
CABBIE Boy, they got a great place here.  Like a fortress! 
SNAKE They? 
From the inside, someone answers. 
MAGGIE Who is it? 
CABBIE It's me! 
MAGGIE Who's me? 
CABBIE Cabbie! 
BRAIN Snake? 
MAGGIE "Harold"? 
SNAKE Where you been, Harold?  It's been a long time. 
MAGGIE You never told me you knew Snake Plissken, Brain. 
CABBIE Isn't that great?  Hey, Brain, I could use some gas if you can spare some . . . 
No one pays attention.  Snake advances on Brain.  Brain sits down. 
SNAKE I'm glad you remember me.  Yeah.  A man should remember his past. Kansas City, four years ago.  You ran out on me.  You left me sitting there. 
BRAIN You were late. 
SNAKE We were buddies, Harold.  You, me, and Fresno Bob.  You know what they did to Bob? 
His face changes.  He suddenly kicks Brain's chair into the wall and points his gun. 
Maggie draws a knife and starts advancing on Snake. 
SNAKE You want to see him sprayed all over that map, baby? (to Brain) Where's the President?! 
BRAIN Swear to god, Snake, I don't know -- 
SNAKE Don't fuck with me! 
BRAIN Why do you want to know? 
SNAKE I want him. 
BRAIN Working for the man now, huh? 
SNAKE Then I'll just beat it out of your squeeze -- 
BRAIN Mm-hm.  Maggie doesn't know EXACTLY where he is and unless you know EXACTLY PRECISELY where he is you'll never find him. 
Snake takes his gun away.  He contemplates Brain. 
BRAIN Just one thing right now.  Don't call me "Harold." 
EXT. BUILDING -- NIGHT Snake, Maggie, Cabbie and Brain all walk out. 
SNAKE So you work for this Duke, huh? 
BRAIN Yeah.  Make gas for him.  Figure out things for him. 
SNAKE Like what? 
BRAIN (showing off) Like how to get across the 69th street bridge -- it's mined, but I know where they're planted. 
MAGGIE We got a diagram from a guy that got all the way across . . . before they shot the poor bastard. 
BRAIN We got a crew up there now clearing the way across the first barricade. 
CABBIE What a sight, Snake!  The whole camp rolling right across the bridge and the President right out front!  Oh, that would have been so fine . . . 
MAGGIE (ironically) Yeah, it would have been . . . 
CABBIE Yeah, but we're going with Snake now. 
The three of them cross into the street.  Cabbie panics. 
CABBIE That's the Duke!  I know the sound of his engines.  Don't cross the Duke -- everybody knows that. 
We get one glimpse of the Duke's car.  Then we realize that Cabbie is gone and his cab is racing away. 
MAGGIE Cabbie, you slime! 
The Duke's car heads right for us. 
MAGGIE No, Brain! 
The two of them run off.  After a while, Snake follows.  The three of them hide.  The Duke's car is an old Chrysler with chandeliers suspended over the headlights.  It's in a caravan of three, leading the way.  A fourth car comes up later.  The Duke is sitting in the passenger seat of a car with Weirdo in the back.  The Duke gets out of the car, Weirdo at his side.  The Duke is wearing a cowboy hat, sunglasses, a snazzy jacket, bluejeans, and boots.  He looks TOUGH.  He sends Weirdo to knock on the door. 
MAGGIE He's looking for you, Brain. 
SNAKE What does he want? 
Snake looks around.  The Duke's caravan passes.  There are more cars than there were before. 
BRAIN It's all right.  He's got to go in the front way.  It'll take him five minutes.  If you're not back to the car in four minutes you're on your own. 
SNAKE When we get there, Harold, you just keep talking. 
They drive off.  Snake gets to the trains.  No one notices.  Maggie and Brain get out of the car and Snake ducks into the train car. 
BRAIN Hi, guys.  Hi . . . how's it going?  Cooled off a little, huh? 
HEAD DUDE What do you want, Brain? 
BRAIN Duke told us to wait inside.  He's on his way here now. 
HEAD DUDE He didn't say nothing to us about it. 
BRAIN Well, you can't expect him to tell everybody in the joint, now can you? That's why he's the Duke. 
The camera angles back to show Snake walking on top of the railroad cars.  He hasn't found the President yet. But he doesn't have time to wonder if Brain double-crossed him. 
HEAD DUDE Why don't we wait outside here for him? 
BRAIN Why don't we wait inside for him? 
HEAD DUDE 'Cause I got orders, that's why. 
BRAIN What are your specific orders, by the way? 
HEAD DUDE Specific orders, Brain, was for me not to let no one go inside. 
BRAIN How's the President holding up, by the way?  Any political discussion you've had with him? 
INT. PRESIDENT'S TRAIN CAR -- NIGHT Two guards sit with the President, talking.  The first guard is by the President.  The second is looking out the window. 
SECOND GUARD That Brain is a real pain in the ass.  He's always sniffing around like a dog. 
FIRST GUARD He comes up with the gas. 
The second guard looks out the window.  Snake grabs him by the neck, and breaks it.  The first guard doesn't notice, but the President does, and that tips off the guard. 
DUKE I said who are you? 
BRAIN Snake Plissken, Duke.  The Man sent him in here.  Something's going down . . . we need him. 
Duke recognizes the name.  He is impressed.  He lets go of the arrow. Snake hates him more than ever. 
DUKE Snaaaaaake Plissken.  I've heard of you. 
He raises a crowbar over his head and smacks Snake with it, knocking him out. 
DUKE I heard you were dead. 
EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT A helicopter flies over the city. 
INT. HELICOPTER -- NIGHT The pilot looks at a grid-view of New York. 
SURVEILLANCE 4 This is surveillance 4 to security control.  Nothing on the infrared body scan.  Nothing in the searchlight. There aren't any fires on the street.  Nobody moving down here. 
INT. BASE -- NIGHT Hauk, Rehme and the Vice President wait. 
SURVEILLANCE 5 Surveillance 5 . . . security control . . . negative on infrared body scan . . . no movement in the searchlight . . . nothing strange going on down there. 
They look at the Master Life Clock.  12:27:39.  38. Where's Plissken? 
INT. ROOM -- DAY Plissken lies unconscious on a bed, crossbow pointed at his head.  Three guards are at the ready. 
INT. BASE -- DAY 
VICE PRESIDENT We've got to go in now. 
HAUK We hold. 
VICE PRESIDENT You're countermanding my orders, Hauk. 
HAUK This is my prison, I'll give the orders. 
VICE PRESIDENT I override all that! 
HAUK Just try. 
The crowd cheers. 
DUKE On the hood of my car! 
More cheers. 
DUKE Let's do it! 
Ugly and Snake take bats.  They circle each other.  Ugly strikes at Snake.  Snake ricochets off the ring.  He rolls around, fighting for his life. 
INT. BUILDING -- SUNSET Brain and Maggie walk around.  They knock on a door and Weirdo answers. He's wearing Cabbie's hat. 
WEIRDO Hello. 
BRAIN Where'd you get the hat? 
WEIRDO Got it from Cabbie. 
BRAIN Yeah? 
WEIRDO Traded him. 
BRAIN For what? 
WEIRDO What are you so nervous about? 
BRAIN I'm here to see the President. 
WEIRDO Who says? 
BRAIN The Duke. 
WEIRDO No he doesn't. 
BRAIN Well... I'll have to tell him you said that. 
Weirdo doesn't really believe it.  If it's not true, so what? 
But if it IS true, the Duke will have him tortured to death. 
REHME Hauk!! 
INT. TOURNAMENT -- EVENING Snake limps around, getting his stuff back together.  He looks at his life clock.  1:34:54.  53.  He doesn't have much time. 
The guy in the cowboy hat runs up to the Duke and yells for attention. Duke immediately gets up and leaves, as do his hangers-on. 
GUY IN COWBOY HAT LISTEN!!!  LISTEN!!!  LISTEN!!! 
The crowd shuts up. 
GUY IN COWBOY HAT THE PRESIDENT'S GONE!  BRAIN TOOK HIM! 
The crowd rushes out.  Snake limps out of the ring and runs off as fast as he can. 
EXT. BASE -- EVENING Rehme catches up to Hauk at the last second.  Hauk has been stalling. 
REHME (shouting over noise) Hauk!  Plissken's tracer! 
Hauk runs up to the head helicopter pilot. 
HAUK Get on the radio!  Keep them down!  Nobody move! 
INT. BASE -- EVENING Two monitors show Snake's tracer. 
REHME He's approaching the World Trade Center. 
HAUK I knew that son of a bitch was alive. 
REHME He's inside. 
INT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- EVENING Snake limps around.  He notices a cab.  Fifty flights of stairs with his leg shot to hell.  He hesitates only for a second, then starts up. 
INT. BASE -- EVENING The Vice President, Hauk and Rehme all stand, staring at the monitors. 
VICE PRESIDENT It's gone. 
HAUK The signal only lasts for 15 minutes.  Download the choppers.  We're in a standby situation. 
Rehme runs off. 
BRAIN I do. 
Snake shoots him a look.  Bullshit, his eyes say, but maybe Brain is telling the truth.  Maybe. 
BRAIN Swear to god, Snake, I know where it is.  Just take us to the car and I'll take you right to it. 
SNAKE Shit... 
He tosses the diagram of the bridge to Brain.  They go down the stairs. Snake's in bad shape, but it's everyone else who's complaining. 
MAGGIE Don't talk.  Breathe. 
PRESIDENT Come on, come on, we're wasting time! 
Snake gets into the car.  It won't start. 
BRAIN What's wrong? 
SNAKE Dead, Harold. 
BRAIN What?! 
Snake hands the keys to Brain. 
SNAKE Here, take these. 
Snake looks under the hood.  There's a man with a crossbow pointed straight at him.  Shit.  They've been caught.  Again. 
DUKE Car trouble? 
Snake looks over the hood.  There's the Duke.  With a dozen guards. Brain steps out. 
BRAIN Hi, Duke. 
DUKE This whole deal of yours is over, Snake.  You and Brain just say good- bye to each other. 
The Duke turns away and loses aim of his gun for a moment.  At that moment, Snake pulls a gun and fires at the steam vent.  At the same time, Maggie slams the hood shut on the guard with the crossbow.  Steam flies everywhere, enough for cover.  The four of them run for it.  The Duke runs after them. 
EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT A cab pulls up.  Its radio is playing "American Bandstand".  Guess who's driving?  You got it! 
Snake pops it into the deck.  It begins spewing out information.  It's the right one.  He slips it into his pocket. 
PRESIDENT Here, give me that tape! 
HA!  No way! 
SNAKE Not just yet. 
Snake checks his life clock.  23:20. 19. 18. 17.  Didn't that guy say 15 minutes before the last hour was up?  But Hauk said they'd been playing with this, so the 15 minutes was built in already.  Still, 23 minutes. That's cutting it pretty fucking close. 
EXT. CAB -- NIGHT Snake races as fast as the cab can go. 
INT. CAB -- NIGHT Snake checks to make sure they're not being followed too closely. They're not.  The Duke is behind, but he's FAR behind. 
CABBIE Easy... easy! 
BRAIN Go for it, Snake! 
EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT Snake jumps the car over the first obstacle.  Cabbie looks like he's having a heart attack. 
Snake swerves on Brain's direction.  So far so good.  A mine goes off, but it's behind them. 
The Duke goes forward.  He's going by the seat of his pants.  But he knows the general direction of how Snake went.  A mine goes off behind him, too. 
INT. CAB -- NIGHT Brain reads the map.  Cabbie continues to freak out. 
CABBIE You've got to slow down a little, Snake... 
BRAIN I think there are three mines ahead, Snake. 
MAGGIE You think?! 
EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT The Duke continues in pursuit. 
INT. CAB -- NIGHT 
BRAIN Stay left, stay left, stay left, and then jog right when I tell you. 
CABBIE You're pushing her too hard, Snake. 
EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT The President and Snake run on. 
EXT. WALL -- NIGHT A jeep pulls up.  Rehme's voice comes up over the loudspeaker.  The guards on the jeep ready the winch. 
REHME This is Rehme, Security Control.  We are in a standby situation. Repeat.  We are in a standby situation.  All helicopters, down.  Wall guard, do not fire on prisoners.  Repeat, do not fire on prisoners.  All vehicles, stand by.  Repeat, stand by. 
EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT Snake and the President are close enough to the wall to hear all this. 
EXT. WALL -- NIGHT The wall guards grab the rope and prepare to lower it for the President and Snake. 
EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT Snake pushes the President up to the wall.  The winch comes down and Snake helps the President into it first.  The President goes up and over.  Snake's life clock reads 1:32.  But he doesn't have time to watch seconds tick away because the Duke is right behind him firing at him. Snake ducks for cover.  The wall guards die.  The winch comes down again, and the Duke sees it.  He starts toward it.  Snake tackles him and beats him up, dazing him but not knocking him out.  He grabs the winch. 
EXT. WALL -- NIGHT A hand stops the winch from moving. 
EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT Snake comes to a stop.  He panics and starts pulling on the winch line. The Duke comes to and stands up.  But he can't get anywhere because the President has found a machine gun and is now firing away.  He is very accurate.  He nails the Duke right away but keeps firing. 
PRESIDENT (manic voice) Yeah, hey, Number One!  You're the Duke!  You're the Duke! 
The President calms down somewhat. 
PRESIDENT You're... the Duke... You're A-Number-One. 
The President starts the winch again.  Snake climbs up and gets over as fast as he can without injuring himself. 
EXT. WALL -- NIGHT Hauk and the medic pull up with the machine.  Hauk interrupts the medic. 
HAUK The tape, Plissken. 
Snake reaches into his pocket, grabs the tape, and hands it to Hauk.  He is furious.  As soon as Hauk has the tape, he lets the medic come back. He holds up two medal pads to Snake's neck.  They buzz, they buzz louder, and then he takes them away. 
MEDIC That's it. 
Snake continues to pant and fume.  He stares at them, then lifts his wrist to look at his life clock.  2 seconds.  One second. 
Beep. 
Nothing. 
Snake lowers his wrist.

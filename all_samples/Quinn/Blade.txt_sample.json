The vampire laughs, air whistling through his ruined larynx. \nQUINN Fuck you, Day-walker, I ain't saying shit -- \nBLADE Frost. \nQuinn responds with a slew of rapid-fire vampire invectives. Blade sees he's getting nowhere fast, calmly sheathes his sword. He unclips a white phosphorous grenade from his combat harness -- \nQUINN You won't stop him, Blade. The Tide's rising, the Sleeper's gonna -- \nBlade shoves the grenade in Quinn's mouth, pulls the pin. WHOOSH! Quinn goes up like a roman candle. Blade turns, surveying his work, ignoring the howling pyre behind him: \nAll evidence of the vampires is gone -- with the exception of a few oily-black puddles. Clothes, jewelry -- it's all been burned away by the acidic process of the creatures' accelerated decomposition. \nDENNIS sits huddled in a corner, having pissed his pants. As Blade approaches, he cringes back -- \nDENNIS Please don't -- \nBlade simply grabs Dennis by the jaw, tilting his head upward, rotating it from side to side -- looking for bite marks. There aren't any. \nBlade moves on, leaving Dennis alone amidst the carnage. As Blade starts up the stairs, he pauses in mid-step -- \nA COCKROACH \nscurries out from underfoot. \nBlade adjusts his footfall, sparing the roach. He continues on up the stairs, disappearing in the smoky haze. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Still warm, too. \nCURTIS WEBB, the forensic pathologist (30s, white bread, a little on the smarmy side) steps forward, unzips the bag -- \nIt's Quinn, what's left of him, anyway. Burnt to a charcoal briquette, limbs twisted horribly, oozing fluids. \nCurtis turns his head, grimacing, wafting the air. \nCURTIS Jesus, that's rank -- \nCurtis turns back, makes note of the blackened stump where Quinn's arm used to be, the ruined throat -- \nCURTIS What's his story? \nASSISTANT Paramedics said he was still screaming when they found him. Looks like some joker had stapled him to a wall. \nCURTIS Pretty. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL, HEMATOLOGY LAB - NIGHT \nMICROSCOPE POV \nof a slide-mounted blood smear stained with Wright stain (blue ink). What we see is a collection of donut-shaped pink things (red blood cells) intermingled with some small blue specks (platelets) and the occasional larger, light-blue blobs (white blood cells). \nKAREN JANSEN (20s), a fine-featured hematologist with a social life in suspended animation, sits back from the microscope, stumped. Next to her is JULIE WHITAKER, a cheerful chemtech. \nKAREN You took this off a DOA? \nCurtis sits on a stool nearby, slowly nodding. \nKAREN This isn't human blood. \nCURTIS Then what is it? \nKAREN I don't know -- (re: microscope) Look at this blood smear -- \nCurtis takes a look for himself. \nKAREN The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.

She opens the door and steps aside, allowing Gideon to enter. \nKAREN Yes, that was me, I'm Karen Jansen -- \nGideon smiles, takes a quick glance around the room, then studies Karen's face, the bandages on her neck. \nGIDEON Are you all right? (off Karen's nod) I'm glad you called, Ms. Jansen, we've been anxious to get a hold of you. You disappeared on us for a while. \nKAREN I know. Listen -- do you have any idea what happened to Curtis, the other doctor? \nGIDEON (matter of fact) Oh, he's dead. But I wouldn't worry about that if I were you. \nKAREN (alarmed) Why? \nGideon's smile vanishes as he unholsters his gun. \nGIDEON Because you're dead too. \nKaren GASPS. She has a half-second to act -- in which she triggers a spray of vampire mace into Gideon's face. Gideon stumbles back, blinded, cursing, rubbing the heel of his palm against his eyes -- \nKaren expects pyrotechnics -- but the end result is little more than an annoyance. A second later, Gideon is simply blinking, sniffing his fingers, confused -- \nGIDEON Garlic? \nKAREN He said it would work against vampires -- \nGideon bursts out laughing. \nGIDEON Who said I was a vampire? \nGideon shakes his head, still snickering. He forces Karen against the wall, placing the gun against her head -- \nGIDEON Thanks for the laugh. You can shut your eyes if you want to. \nCRASH!!! The front door explodes open as Blade comes flying through it! \nGideon tries to bring his pistol up -- but Blade grips the man's hand and squeezes. Gideon SCREAMS as his bones snap like kindling. The pistol falls from his grasp -- \nBlade fires his fist into Gideon's gut again and again, then flings the officer across the room, sending him SMASHING into a glass-cased cabinet. Bleeding, battered, Gideon struggles to stand -- \nBlade is all over him, kicking the shit out of the rogue cop until he sinks to the floor in a half-conscious haze. \nBlade stands over Gideon's limp form, fists clenched, breathing heavily, touching down after his adrenaline high. Finally, he looks to Karen -- \nBLADE You okay? \nKaren nods, glances at Gideon -- \nKAREN How did you know? \nBLADE Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up. \nKAREN You used me as bait?! \nBLADE It worked, didn't it? \nKAREN But, he could've -- \nBLADE He didn't. Get over it. \nBlade kneels next to Gideon. He turns the man's head, inspects the neck, the skin behind the ear -- \nKAREN But he's a policeman -- \nBLADE He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark? \nBlade pushes aside Gideon's hair, revealing a tiny, cryptic symbol tattooed into the man's scalp. \nBLADE That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner -- (studying the glyph) This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now -- \nKAREN Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them? \nBLADE Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them. \nKAREN And that's a good thing? \nBLADE For some. Live forever, never get old.

Blade follows, his hand resting on the butt of his Casull. \nBLADE You're not going anywhere. \nFROST (growling) Watch me. \nFrost's eyes flicker towards the street -- a CITY BUS is rumbling by.

It's Frost or the girl -- and for a moment we actually think he's going to go for Frost -- \n-- but then he DIVES forward, scooping the girl into his arms, throwing themselves out of the bus' path.

It's started. \nKaren spins, startled. Blade stands behind her.

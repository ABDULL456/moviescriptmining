FARMYARD - DAY                                            59 Overnight, the remnants of a company of soldiers, fresh             * from battle, have collected in the courtyard. Some are tired, dispirited, others are wounded. Our Travellers               * watch from the farm window. A few mounted knights come into the yard, herding in front of them a small group of prisoners, well-dressed knights and squires.

God will protect his ewe lambs.                                          * Suddenly the door is thrown open and four SOLDIERS man- handle an inert body, dressed in full armor, into the room. They scatter the food from the table and lay out the MOANING suit of armor on it. A young SQUIRE follows them in and kneels by the knight in the suit. The MOANS are MUFFLED because the knight's helmet has been battered out of shape in the battle and can't be removed. The ugly dent suggests an equally ugly wound inflicted on the head inside. The Soldiers gingerly try to remove the helmet. Their efforts are useless. Blood oozes from the joints of the helmet. The MOANING suit of armor seems inhuman, robot-like. \nSOLDIER Must be sore in there.   Is it your dada? The Squire looks at him and nods his head.       Hector looks        * with sympathy at the boy.                                            * \nSOLDIER #2 If he's got a little head it might be alright. Has your dada got a big head? \nAn OFFICER comes into the room. OFFICER Is there a blacksmith here? Where's the smith? FARM WOMAN In the village, sir, half a day away. The Officer looks at the moaning suit of armor, then at the astonished group of Travellers. He picks on the Priest. OFFICER You, Priest, come here... get to work on him... he's not ready for heaven yet... there's a hundred thousand livres on his head if I get him to Paris alive... Start                         * praying... there's fifteen livres in it for you if he lives... \nThe Priest obediently goes up to the knight and starts to pray earnestly. The Officer turns to the Soldiers. \n(CONTINUED) \n60   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              60 OFFICER Get that helmet off... get hammers, anything you can find...                      * and one of you get back down into the valley and fetch an armorer. \nThe Soldiers scatter to   carry out their orders. Hector            * takes time to watch the   Squire still kneeling beside his          * father, quietly stroking   the helmet. Ronald the Priest mutters every prayer he   can remember. The suit of armor twitches and MOANS. \nHector looks at Beatrice and motions for her to follow him outside. The Priest looks on helplessly as they slide past the table and head for the door. \n61   EXT. FARM - DAY                                                61 More soldiers have continued to make their way to the shelter of the farm. Everywhere is the chaos of war. Wounded men lie awaiting the attentions of either the medicos or the priest. Prisoners huddle in cowed groups. Everyone looks for food. Individual soldiers, like lost souls, run here and there trying to regroup with their comrades. The youngest are squires of twelve or thir- teen, the oldest are red-faced, overweight knights in expensive armor. \nHector and Beatrice have found a quiet corner where they can sit and talk. Behind them is a group of soldiers, reserves who have not yet joined the battle. They are much fresher than the rest and are drilling as a disci- plined unit. Their movements are a strange cross between parade ground drill and battle training. To the BEAT of DRUMS they perform rhythmic, hypnotic movements, repeating the same pattern over and over again. A deadly dance, thrusting their pikes in unison. They become like one evil, inhuman machine. It is mesmerizing to watch, all the                * more so in relation to the coy seduction scene that Hector and Beatrice are acting out. They have the problem of not sharing a language, but, resourceful as lovers are, they soon employ this as another titillating element in their love-play. \nHECTOR I think you know what I'm saying ... a little... \n(CONTINUED) \n61   CONTINUED:                                                    61 BEATRICE No, I don't, I don't understand a word. HECTOR How come you don't speak like anyone else? Are you far from home? Home? Where you sleep and live? BEATRICE I think I know what you mean... home. HECTOR I'm far from home, too... way, way                    * over there... then across the sea... BEATRICE You're losing me again. HECTOR Have you ever seen the sea?

BEATRICE I know what you're saying... you're saying home... say something else. HECTOR Home... home... try it... home... BEATRICE You want the word for home? It's home... say it... home... home... \nHECTOR I don't want your word for home, I want you to say mine... home... home... BEATRICE Come on, you can do it... home... home... Beatrice has her way, turning the tables on Hector.    He says it in her language. \nHECTOR Home... home... Beatrice smiles. In this tiny victory the dynamic of their relationship is set. BEATRICE That's it... clever boy! \nThey fall silent, suddenly shy. Beatrice breaks this             * moment by reaching out to Hector's neck, very delicately, like a caress. Hector smiles. There first touch. Then            * it changes. Beatrice completes her movement with a sharp grab at Hector's hair, and pinches her fingers on something. Triumphantly she shows him the flea she has caught. \nBEATRICE Tick... it's a tick. HECTOR Flea... a flea... thanks. \nBeatrice looks at him directly now, their intimacy well under way.

She ruffles his hair, in a motherly but then again sex-                  * ually provocative way. He understands her well now. \nHECTOR Why don't we go somewhere and have a good session... I could do you... I'd like to give you a good grooming... They understand each other perfectly now.         They look around for a more private spot. \n62   INT.

Ronald mumbles quietly to himself in prayer. The knight is deathly still, no sight or sound of breathing or moaning. The suit of armor seems to grow even more rigid as we look at it. There is no sense of it containing life. The Officer re-enters the room from outside. OFFICER How is he? PRIEST Sleeping now... at peace, for the moment. OFFICER Leave him for a while.

CAR - DAY                                         153 A trip from Queens to New Jersey at five o'clock on a Friday afternoon is going to look like a dream sequence whatever you do with it, and that's fine. Hector's trip to his children has more meaning for us than a simple journey from A to B. We will be aware of our other Hectors, and the journeys home that they did or didn't manage to make. This car trip will pull the threads together. And after so many images of the natural world, a world little altered by man, the PANORAMIC SHOTS of New York in all its mad glory will place our Hector in a new dimen- sion. If there is a breathtaking moment in this film, when everything comes together, when all the pieces fit, then it will be somewhere around here that it happens. Six thousand years ago we left Hector on a beach, aching for his family. If the traffic allows, tonight in New Jersey Hector will complete his journey. We will GO WITH Hector OVER the bridge, ACROSS the avenues of Manhattan and THROUGH the tunnel. His PHONE RINGS ONCE. \nHECTOR Hello... Leonard, hello... yes... we're insured... thank God... yes now I know God's a lawyer... thanks... On the outskirts of Jersey City he finds the suburban street he is looking for. If the last crosslight holds on green then he might even make it on time. Hector stops the car outside Janet's house and lets out a sigh of relief. \n154   EXT.

Janet talks to Hector. JANET You made it. The kids are just coming. They're not over the moon about going to the beach house. I ought to warn you. \nHECTOR Why didn't you say? I could have fixed up something else. I thought it would be a good place to get to know them again... \nJANET Well, I figured you should be                            * allowed to make your own mistakes. It's only for a couple of nights, they can take it... and you'll learn... Check into a hotel if it gets too much... they like hotels. She shouts into the house. JANET Come on, you two... your father's ready to go... She hands Hector a piece of paper. \nJANET This is where we'll be, if anything crops up... thanks for the break... Hector gets a little scared about what he has taken on. \nHECTOR Maybe this is a bit sudden for them... Maybe I should have come over a couple of nights and got to know them... \nJanet doesn't let him off the hook.

JANET That's what they call you. \nHector is daunted by how grown up they are, not any more the little kids in the photograph in his wallet. \nHECTOR Hi. They hardly lift their heads to him. \nBETSY Hi. TOM Hi. Janet takes control of the farewells. \nJANET You three have a good weekend. If it's too miserable at the house your father said he'll take you to a hotel. Hector nods his head obediently. He always did with Janet. The children let their mother pat them and follow Hector to his car, eyes to the ground. \nJANET Good luck, Hector. \nDonald shouts from behind the wheel of his car, where he has been hiding. DONALD See you Monday, Hector. The kids load themselves into the back of Hector's car. \nBetsy notices the huge arrangement of flowers, wrapped in cellophane and red ribbon.

How could he possibly unravel the secret of the pancakes, what comfort could he offer his stranger daughter if he did? It is a spooky, mystical moment for Hector, more mystical than the mumbo-jumbo still issuing from the TV next door. TV WOMAN (V.O.) ... find your true cosmic partner first time around... every weekday morning at three here on the Psychic Network... Lucinda's Horoscope Dating Show... remember there is an answer, and there is a special partner out there for you... Hector moves quietly out of the room, Betsy's sobs having subsided.

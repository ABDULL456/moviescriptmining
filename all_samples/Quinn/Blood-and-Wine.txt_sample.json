He looks at his wife with her glass, Alex with his glass, and doesn't like it. His voice hardens slightly. \nFRANK Are we all set, Alex? \nALEX I'm going to check the storage room, see what else'll travel. I know I put some vintage Armagnac in there, maybe some Porto?

Jason plays the shark until it's close to the boat and thrashing for its life. Gabriella's scared. \nGABRIELLA Help him, Alex. \nALEX I'd just get in his way. His hand comes to rest on her shoulder as Jason expertly reels in the bucking hammerhead. She shrugs away from his hand. Jason has hooked a ten-foot, three-finned sea beast with a spade-shaped head and black eyes on each side. He attaches the line to a winch and winds it up onto the deck.

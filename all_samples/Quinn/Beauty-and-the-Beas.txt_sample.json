Quickly moves towards the voices -- \nBELLE Who said that? Who's there? \nBelle reaches the spot where she heard the voices. No one there. Only a clock and candelabra. Suddenly, a COUGH echoes through the castle. Belle grabs the candelabra and climbs a long staircase. The clock shudders with dread. \n34    INT. PRISON TOWER - CASTLE - DAY                             34 \nBelle follows the cough up a labyrinth of stairs until she reaches the dark prison tower and a GRATED IRON DOOR. \nBELLE Papa!?   Is that you? \nBelle sees Maurice through a grate in the door.   He looks terribly pale and sick, coughing. \nMAURICE (O.S.) Belle?   How did you find me!? \nBelle puts the candelabra down and clutches his hands. \nBELLE Oh, your hands are ice.   We need to get you home. \nMAURICE Belle, you must leave here at once. This castle is alive! Now go, before he finds you! \nBELLE Who?! \nThe beast roars. Belle spins quickly, swinging her club to strike, but the figure jumps onto another staircase. Belle searches the shadows. The voice circles her. \nBELLE (CONT'D) Who's there? Who are you? \nTHE BEAST (O.S.) Who are you? \nBELLE I've come for my father. \nTHE BEAST (O.S.) Your father is a thief. \nBELLE Liar! \nTHE BEAST (O.S.) HE STOLE A ROSE. \nIn Belle's wide eyes, we see her guilt. \nBELLE I asked for the rose.   Punish me, not him! \nMAURICE No, he means forever. Apparently that's what happens around here when you pick a flower. \nBELLE A life sentence for a rose? \nTHE BEAST I received eternal damnation for one. I'm merely locking him away. Now... do you still wish to take your father's place? \nBELLE Come into the light. \nThe figure remains still. Belle grabs hold of Lumiere and thrusts the candle forward, illuminating a HIDEOUS HORNED FACE. Belle's eyes go wide as she clearly sees THE BEAST. The only part of him that seems human are his eyes. BLUE. \nDEEP. SOULFUL.   And flicked with pain when he sees Belle's revulsion. \nTHE BEAST CHOOSE! \nMAURICE Belle, I won't let you do this. I lost your mother. I won't lose you too. Now go! \nMaurice falls into a terrible coughing fit. \nBELLE Alright, Papa. I will leave. (to the beast) I need a minute alone with him. \nThe beast doesn't respond. \nBELLE (CONT'D) Are you so cold-hearted that you won't allow a daughter to kiss her father goodbye? (off his proud grunt) Forever can spare a minute! \nIntrigued by her defiance, the beast moves toward her, reaching out with his massive paw. Belle closes her eyes, bracing herself for his retaliation. Instead, she hears -- CLANG. \nBelle opens her eyes to find herself eye to eye with the beast's chest. He has reached high above her head to pull down an iron lever, unlocking the door. \nTHE BEAST When this door closes, it will not open again. \n35   INT.

This is CADENZA, our neurotic Italian maestro. \nLUMI\u00c8RE Maestro Cadenza, are you ready? \nCADENZA (coy) It has been so long since I've performed!

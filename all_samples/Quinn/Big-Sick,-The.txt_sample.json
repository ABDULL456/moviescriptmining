Dalavan's in the crowd tonight. Could I do ten? \nDODD No. Five minutes. You put out chairs, you get five minutes. You know the deal. \nKUMAIL C'mon man. I'll double it up next time. \nDODD No. \nDodd walks back into the bathroom. \nKUMAIL What are you gonna do in there? \nDODD I'm making up next week's schedule. \nKUMAIL Okay. Cool. \nINT. TRIPLE DOOR - LATER \nCJ is on stage crushing it. Kumail and Mary watch from the wings. \nCJ I was in bed with my girlfriend and I was trying to mansplain to her that, you know, we are on one little rock orbiting a star in a galaxy of a billion stars in a universe full of a billion galaxies, so I forgot your birthday. Who gives a shit? You are cosmically over reacting to this. Honestly you are being super selfish. You're right, but you're selfish. \nKumail looks out at the crowd. Dalavan enjoys CJ's set. \nINT. TRIPLE DOOR - LATER \nKumail puts a RECORDER on his stool, presses RECORD and starts his set. \nKUMAIL Hey! Have you guys heard of this new drug cocktail called cheese? I saw these news reports so I looked up what cheese is and cheese is a mixture. Cheese is Tylenol PM and heroin. So really, it's heroin. Heroin's doing the heavy lifting. Just do the heroin, it's very powerful. You already have heroin. \nKumail looks to see if Bob Dalavan is laughing. He's not there. He's in the back talking to CJ. Fuck. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) (pushing through) Is Pakistan in the house?! \nO.S. A WOMAN \"Woo-hoos!\" Kumail looks out at the crowd and sees EMILY, late 20's, white with a streak of blue in her hair. She sits at a table with a few friends. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) You're not from Pakistan. I would have noticed you. \nShe smiles. \nCrowded bar scene after the show. Kumail, Chris, Mary and CJ hang out at the bar. \nCHRIS He just gave you Montreal? Like you don't have to showcase or audition or anything? \nCJ It was too easy. Like I wanted to struggle. I wanted a story to be able to tell on talk shows and instead, like, you guys don't know how hard it is not to struggle. It's a struggle succeeding effortlessly. \nMARY Did he say anything about me? \nCJ Sure. \nCHRIS What about me? \nCJ Both of you. He said, those guys performed... \nMARY I truly hate you, actually. \nCHRIS We all hate you. \nKumail walks over to Emily and her friend JESSIE, talks loud over the music. \nKUMAIL Hi. \nEMILY Hi. \nKUMAIL Um, my name is Kumail. \nEMILY Yeah. We know. \nJESSIE We saw you perform. \nKUMAIL Yeah. Now that the niceties are out of the way, I have to tell you that when you yelled at me, it threw me off. You really shouldn't heckle comedians. It's so rude. \nEMILY I didn't heckle you. I just woo-hooed you. It was supportive. \nKUMAIL Okay, that's a common misconception. Yelling anything at a comedian is considered heckling. Heckling doesn't have to be negative. \n", "random": "\nHESLEY I don't know what to do. \nKUMAIL I don't know what to do. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) You're an idiot. \nKUMAIL Oh my God. \nHESLEY It's okay.

You're being bigoted towards air based comfort items. \nKumail picks up the remote and turns on the TV. Night of the Living Dead is playing. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) Night of The Living Dead? \nEMILY Sure, I haven't ever seen that movie. \nKUMAIL Okay, so basically the dead start rising. And the good guys, um... \nThey eye each other flirtatiously. Laugh. Lean in and kiss. \nINT. KUMAIL'S LIVING ROOM \nChris hits the Siri button on his iPhone. \nCHRIS Text Lauren. You up girl? \nSIRI What do you want to say to Warren? \nCHRIS Ah, no. Fuck. \nChris hits the Siri button again. \nSIRI What do you want to say to- \nCHRIS You up? Period.

KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nKumail and Emily post-coital. \nEMILY What are these scars? \nKUMAIL Oh, they're a smallpox vaccination. \nEMILY I thought only old people had those. \nKUMAIL Well I'm from Pakistan. We're still fighting some battles you guys have already won. \nEMILY What were you like in high school? Were you like, super funny? Were you really smart? \nKUMAIL I was very shy. They called me chashmullee. \nEMILY What is that? \nKUMAIL It roughly translates to \"dweeb.\" I'll show you a picture. \nKumail flips through his phone and produces his old high school photo, shows it to her. \nEMILY Of you in high school? Oh my god! \nKUMAIL Boom. \nEMILY No. \nKUMAIL And I'm thinking I'm killing it right now. \nEMILY What inspired this hair cut? \nKUMAIL Hugh Grant. \nEMILY Oh no. And you're so serious. \nKUMAIL I read in an interview with Hugh Grant, he said he doesn't smile because it makes his face look fat. So I didn't smile in pictures for many years. What were you like in high school? Were you voted... Most Sexy? \nEMILY No. I was voted \"Most Noticeable.\" \nKUMAIL That's good. \nEMILY No. It's really not good. I had acne, and I was a Goth and I had this terrible perm. The kids called me Beetlejuice. I don't know why. Actually I do know why, it's because they thought I looked like Beetlejuice. I think I'm done with this subject. In fact, I think I'm gonna go home. \n", "random": "JUANICE I think you should put your shoes on. \nJUANICE Yes, I think you should put them on.

We know what's at the end of it. \nHECKLER Cuz of how he looks. \nKUMAIL There it is. \nBETH That is like saying that all frat boys wearing country club hats and Hawaiian shirts have shriveled up, tiny little dicks! \nThe crowd reacts. \nKUMAIL Actually, Beth, this is a bad way for you to find out, but he's right. I actually am a terrorist. I just do stand-up comedy on the side to keep a low profile. \nHECKLER Fuck you. \nKUMAIL First of all, very clever. Did you write that at home?

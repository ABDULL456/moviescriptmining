Groomsman DEAN finishes a speech. They are now in the dining room. \nDEAN So cheers to you two, our last single friends finally crossing over into the world of marital bliss, welcome to the other side! Dana snaps a photo, crying. Helen approaches the podium. \nHELEN Hello everyone. My name is Helen Harris the Third, an honored member of the bridal party. In honor of Lillian and Dougie, I'd like to take this opportunity to read a poem that I penned last summer while I was sitting on a swing at an exclusive resort in Santorini. Annie whispers to the person next to her. \nANNIE Am I supposed to give a speech? As Helen reads, Annie looks around the room and sees everyone in awe. Dana starts to cry. She reads from a fancy sheet of stationary. \nHELEN With every blink of an eye, every kiss of a lip, every stroke of a lovers hand, every...scent of a woman, every breath you take, every move you make. Love conquers all. Annie sees that Lillian is touched. Helen gets emotional. \nHELEN (CONT'D) They say when you choose a mate, yo're choosing a best friend. Dougie, yo're a lucky man. Lillian, I know you're going to make a wonderful wife, because you have been the best friend that I could ever ask for. Annie's face goes blank. \nHELEN (CONT'D) I have never had a friendship like this. I'm so happy you two are finally taking this big step together and I ca't wait for all of the adventures that await us. People are moved, sniffling. Including Lillian. \nHELEN (CONT'D) Now \u00e2\u0080\u009cDougly\u00e2\u0080\u009d, sorry, inside joke. You better not keep my Lil on a leash. I still need my drunken nights at Rockin Sushi!

The room looks around. Annie slowly rises. \nHELEN (CONT'D) There she is. Annie is our Maid of Honor everyone. And I'm sure she'd like to take this time to say a few words. Annie? Annie stands up to the applause. The room falls silent as she walks to the podium. \nANNIE Um, hello everybody. Hi everyone. 'm Annie. Wow, it really smells like vanilla in here. \nMEGAN It's the candles Annie. \nANNIE Thanks Megan. Lillian this is gonna be awesome.

You two are so happy together and hope you have a happy lifetime of happiness and celebrating. And I love you and....Lillian, w've been best friends since we were like 5...'ve never been to Greece...

They both laugh. \nANNIE God, I don't know, I was just maybe a little out of my element, and after Helen's speech-- \nLILLIAN Ann, stop. \nANNIE I'm so embarrassed. What did you think of your engagement party? \nLILLIAN Besides the impromptu concert from Bette Midler, it was perfect. They laugh and hug. \nLILLIAN (CONT'D) I gotta go say bye to some people I do't know. Drive safe. Lillian goes back inside. Helen appears out of thin air. \nHELEN Annie! Great job tonight.. \nANNIE I'm feeling slightly mortified. \nHELEN No, nononono. Not at all. Everyone gets a little nervous and carried away during those kind of things. So listen, 've been brainstorming some theme ideas for Lillian's shower. I was thinking somewhere along the lines of Alice in Wonderland meets...are you ready? Hollywood. And for the bachelorette? Vegas. \nANNIE Aren't I supposed to be planning some of these things? \nHELEN Oh, well, I hadn't heard from you and-- \nANNIE She just got engaged two weeks ago. \nHELEN Well, I figured since you don't have any experience that you might get overwhelmed by events of this caliber. \nANNIE Helen, I'm pretty capable.

The life of the party, a concert pianist, she had naturally curly hair, and skin black as night. But one evening at a dinner party I walked in on her in the bathroom putting a vile of cocaine up her buttocks and last I heard, she was playing the saxophone outside of a drug store. And I'm gonna say something to you I should have told her. Don't waste your life. Find out what your gifts are and use them. Donna hugs Annie, then leaves her in the break room. \nINT.

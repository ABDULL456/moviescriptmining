Annie Hayworth. \nMELANIE (realizing this was a mistake) Yes. \nMITCH How do you know Annie? \nMELANIE (the lie getting deeper) We... we went to school together. College. \nMITCH Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying? \nMELANIE Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend. \nMITCH I think we'll have to shave the hair.

Melanie looks over her shoulder. \nMELANIE (holding her breath) I don't think they're coming. \nCathy does not turn: she is staring ahead of her, her eyes wide, her lip trembling.

The bay is silent. The gull spreads its wings to brake, and then sits on the water. The CAMERA continues low over the water, going through thousands of gulls sitting there patiently, as if it is threading itself through a crowd, not a sound, over the gulls, and then lifting to show the Brenner house in the distance. \nFULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE \nBehind the panes of glass, we can see the boards Mitch nailed across the windows. He is on the roof now, testing the two attic dormer windows. He turns to look out over the bay. \nLONG SHOT - THE BAY \ncovered with sitting gulls. In the distance, the town is still smoldering. But the sky is clear of birds. \nMED. SHOT - MITCH \npicking up his hammer, sliding over the shingles to where the ladder leans against the side of the house. \nFULL SHOT - THE HOUSE \nas Mitch comes down the ladder and Melanie turns the corner, carrying a load of driftwood and old lumber. \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH \nas she drops the wood outside the door and he joins her. She is looking out over the bay when he comes to her. This is not the Melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture. Her hair is disarrayed, and her face and clothing are streaked with soot. But beyond a surface physical appearance, there is a weary wisdom in her eyes, and a strength to her as she stands looking toward the distant smoldering town. \nMELANIE The town looks clear. \nMITCH The bay doesn't. \nMELANIE How long have they been gathering there? \nMITCH The past fifteen minutes. (pause) It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again. \nMelanie nods. They are both silent, watching the bay. \nMELANIE I keep thinking of Annie. (she squeezes her eyes shut) \nMITCH (after a long pause) It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise... \nMELANIE (looking) Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week. \nMITCH It may not be last week again for a long long time. \nThey are both silent. \nMELANIE Look. They're still coming. \nMitch nods. Silence. \nMITCH Do you want to try your father again? (Melanie shakes her head.  Puzzled, Mitch looks at her) \nMELANIE I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead. \nMITCH Have we still got power? \nMELANIE Yes. (leaning against him) I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired. \nLYDIA (O.S.) Mitch! I'm getting something on the radio! \nINT. THE LIVING ROOM - FULL SHOT \nLydia is hovering near the radio. Cathy is sitting on a footstool. The windows are boarded, and the lights in the room are on. A tremendous amount of static is coming from the radio as Mitch and Melanie join them \nLYDIA I can't get any of the local stations. I think this is San Francisco. \nANNOUNCER ...would include formulation of a central financing committee to handle credit and to allocate responsibility for the various facets of the project. A vote on the motion is expected early tomorrow morning. \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH \nlistening. \nANNOUNCER Continuing with the local news, police are still investigating the series of valuable jade burglaries in the Chinatown area. The round-up of known criminals has not as yet produced a suspect, but Commissioner Nelson said today he was certain the burglaries were quote linked and the work of the team of professionals unquote. (pause) In Bodega Bay early this morning, a large flock of crows attacked a group of children who were leaving the school during a fire drill. One little girl was seriously injured and taken to the hospital in Santa Rosa, but the majority of children reached safety in the town. (pause) On the national scene today, the opening of the new session of Congress was marked by a State of the Union address that... \nMITCH Is that all? \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) ...drew a standing ovation for the President. The Chief Executive, in discussing our relation to Europe and the rest of the world community said: \"These various elements of our foreign policy lead as I have said to a single goal -- \nMITCH (sighing) We're going to need more wood for the fire. We can't let it go out. \nANNOUNCER (continuing as drone in background) The goal of a peaceful world of free and independent states.  This is our guide for the present and our vision for the future -- a free community of nations, independent but interdependent, uniting north and south, east and west, in one great family of man, outgrowing and transcending the hates and fears that rend our age.  We will not reach that goal today or tomorrow.  We may not reach it in our lifetime.  But the quest is the great adventure of our century.  We sometimes chafe at the burdens of our obligations, the complexity of our decisions, the agony of our choices, but there is no comfort or security for us in evasion, no solution in abdication, no relief in irresponsibility. (pause) In assuming the tasks of the Presidency, I said that few generations, in all history, had been granted the role of being the great defender of freedom in its hour of maximum danger.  This is our good fortune, and I welcome it now as I did when I first took office. (pause) For it is the fate of this generation -- Of you in the Congress and of me as President -- to live with a struggle we did not start, in a world we did - not make. But the pressures of life are not always distributed by choice. And while no nation has ever faced such a challenge, no nation has ever been ready to seize the burden and the glory of... \nLYDIA (pause) Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch? \nMITCH I got them all, Mother. \n", "random": "ichael turns to see her, \"you are going to be the one to make her go of her own accord.\" \nCADEN Yes! \nMichael stares at her. \nCADEN (OMNIFOUS) You are going to be the one to make her go of her own accord. \nMICHAEL (OMNIFOUS) Yes! \nCADEN \nMichael looks at her. \nMICHAEL I thought about it too.

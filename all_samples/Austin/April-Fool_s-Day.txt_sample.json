The Ferryman and Buck remain at the stern. \nECU - THE DECK \nAs Skip's knife flies INTO FRAME, it bites into the boards and holds. SKIP AND ARCH \nat their game. Arch stretches, can't reach the knife, and topples over. \nSkip hoots triumphantly. \nSKIP First round, the champ! \nNIKKI AND HARVEY \nNikki, much to her chagrin, finds herself the object of Harvey's attentions. \nHARVEY Y'know what I find amazin'?

Muffin? \nNIKKI Muffers, Moffo, Muff-child , Muffin' stuff, the Muffster... \nHARVEY (GRINS) I bet you're her oldest friend. \nNIKKI (BORED) Actually, she's three months older than I am. \nHARVEY You know what I mean. \nNIKKI Harvey... are you planning a career in politics when you grow up? \nHARVEY I've given it some thought. Why? \nNIKKI Oh, just a hunch. \nHARVEY First, though, I'm hopin' to interview with her daddy's company, Southern Regional Sales, next year before graduation... Y'know, he's worth more'n 50 mill over the counter! \nShe just stares at him. CLOSE UP - THE KNIFE \ndigging into the deck again. \nARCH (O.S.) Jesus... \nARCH and SKIP \nThe knife is at an impossible distance. \nSKIP (LAUGHING) Go for it, big fella. \nArch swallows his pride and makes a hopeless attempt. \nCHAZ fastens onto Nan, immersed in one of her books. He carries his own. \nCHAZ (sitting beside her) Whatcha readin'? \nNAN Milton. Paradise Lost. For Professor Russo's course on the English epic... It's a shame. It's a dying form.

ARCH'S ROOM - NIGHT Arch is pacing the bedroom, horny and alone. He gets an idea, goes and rummages through Chaz' stuff and comes up with a video cassette of a porno movie. Carrying -the cassette he crosses to the door and turns the handle. The doorknob comes off in his hand. He throws it down in disgust, goes and sits in a chair and broods. The chair collapses beneath him. ", "truth": "Skip makes his way boldly, carelessly, drunkenly along. Overgrown weeds and tall spring grass choke the path, shadowing his way. He takes one last drink, killing the bottle, and hurls it out into the night. \nAfter a long pause there is the distant sound O.S. of the bottle landing in water with a splash. \nEXT. OLD , BOATHOUSE - NIGHT \nSkip emerges from the overgrowth. The abandoned old structure and its dock squat ahead at water's edge. Beneath the boathouse, floating in the water, is a grungy old skiff covered by a tarp. Skip turns away from the dock, and flicks his lighter among the weeds, finding marijuana growing there. He CACKLES with triumph. \nSomething MOVES nearby. He doesn't pay attention, taking out his knife to cull the dried leaves. He cups them in his hand against the wind, douses his lighter, and hurries out onto the dock to the boathouse entrance to prepare his joint. \nINT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT \nas Skip enters. It is pitch black in here, and aside from the gentle lapping sounds of water against the pilings down below O.S., all is still. \nSkip flips a lightswitch in the darkness and nothing happens. He edges slowly along a wall away from the door. Then he becomes aware of another living presence in the boathouse. It is a slow breathing sound--completely inhuman. \nSKIP Hello? \nThere is no answer, but the breathing continues. Then a sharp rapping sound very near, like a foot striking the wood flooring. \nSKIP Who's there? \nPause. No answer. We hear in the darkness the sound of his switchblade clicking open. And then he waits, straining his ears to hear. \nFinally, Skip reaches into his pocket, puils out his lighter and flicks it on. \nSomething snags him from behind. \nSkip gasps, helpless, as a thick rope controlled by powerful, shadowed hands tightens around his neck. \nHis knife, dried leaves and lighter cascade to the floor. \nEXT. ST. JOHN HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER \nOnly the porch light remains glowing. The house is dark. \nINT. ROB AND KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT \nRob wakes, hearing the CRY from Muff's room. Kit, naked against him, wakes too. They hear the muffled cry again. It is not from lovemaking. Rob throws off the covers. INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nRob wraps himself with a towel, stepping quickly out to Muffy's door. Everything else is dark and quiet. \nROB (hushed, at door) Muffy? \nNo answer. He tries her door, but it's locked tight. \nA beat. Then: \nROB (cont.) (CONCERNED) Muffy? \nMUFFY'S VOICE (UNCERTAINLY) Yes? \nROB You OK? \nMUFFY'S VOICE (DISTANTLY) Yes... Thank you... \nHe pulls back from the door. \nROB (reluctantly, puzzled) OK... well, goodnight... \nNo response. He turns back for his room, catching sight of Chaz, who has come out of Nikki's room, to investigate, too. \nEXT. HOUSE - MORNING \nHarvey is out on the second floor balcony exercising vigorously. No one else is in evidence until a bedroom window flies open and Nikki, naked from the waist up and believing herself unwatched, leans out and stretches, breathing in the sweet morning air. \nThen she sees Harvey grinning at her. She quickly covers herself and pulls back inside. INT. KITCHEN \u00ad DAY \nRob and Kit are the first ones down. They enter from the dining room, surprising Muffy at the stove. \nKIT (BRISKLY) Good morning! \nMuffy turns abruptly, startled. Rob and Kit stop abruptly, too. \nANGLE \nMuffy is barefooted, dressed in an old, worn chenille robe. Her hair, normally carefully groomed, is unkempt, wild and stringy about her pale face. Talk about unguarded moments. Her present appearance, is the last way one would ever expect to find Muffy St. John. \n", "random": "NT. ARCH'S ROOM - NIGHT \nArcher is on his way to the door.

We should all stay together. \nMUFFY This is my house. (BEAT) I'll be in my room. \nShe turns and heads up the stairs. \nPause. NIKKI (FINALLY) She's got a point.

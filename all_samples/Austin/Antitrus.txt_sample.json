You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime. \nMILO Is that how Larry feels? \nTEDDY Uh. Not exactly. \nA brown Buick parks behind Teddy's car. As they speak, a rumpled, 50ish MAN in an off-the-rack suit gets out. \nMILO Wanted to say goodbye to him... \nTEDDY Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five! \nMilo grins, he high-fives Teddy. \nTEDDY We rented a loft in Sunnyvale. (he gives Milo the number) You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms. \nMILO Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff. \nThey embrace.

They got their -- \nThe rumpled Man sits on a radiator, watching CNN on a TV, the last remaining piece of furniture. Alice enters, holding a jam jar filled water, hands Milo a business card. \nALICE Milo, this is Mr. Barton from the Justice Department. (gives Barton the water) Sorry about the glass. \nMilo reads the card: Lyle Barton, Asst. Prosecutor, DOJ, Seattle Branch Office. Milo's a little spooked. \nBARTON Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant. \nMILO Right... What's that mean again? \nBARTON Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do. \nMILO (fiddling with the card) It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something... \nBARTON Like I said: shot in the dark. \nMilo tries to give back the card. \nBARTON If you see something there that rubs you the wrong way? Do the right thing. \nAnd he goes. \nMILO That took some fun out of -- \nALICE We're not gonna let it. \nShe kisses him. They head out. We linger.

A Teacher leads her little charges inside. \nREDMOND Gary's put millions in there. And the people with kids? They're not hotshot geeks, they're just payroll clerks or whatever. \nTwo Men in suits, with briefcases, (conspicuous amid the Geeks in jeans and T-shirts) enter Building #19. \nREDMOND You'll see alot of that: Department of Justice goons snooping around. \nThe car pulls into a lot full of Miatas, BMW's, Boxters. \nCLOSE ON - THE OUTPOST LOGO \nTHEN TILT UP TO SHOW: \nEXT.

When their eyes meet, she busies herself, placing the plates back on her tray. \nMILO ...She is. (turning away from Lisa) She is! \nLisa passes behind them, smiles fleetingly at Milo. At a table, Randy and Phil note the \"interaction.\" Meantime: \nREDMOND 'Might be some friction on the domestic front. You're expected you to put in ridiculous hours.

Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself. \nGARY Okay. I'm Gary. \nMilo's smile deepens. Gary notices the small painting (by Alice) hanging on the wall. He stares at it. \nGARY 'Think I should buy some originals? \nMILO ...Do I? \nGARY Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions. \nMILO That's insane. You're ahead of your time. \nGARY That's what I told her. My wife. \nMilo colors as Gary drags a second chair in front of the screen; didn't realize he was contradicting Mrs. Boyd. \nGARY 'Thinks I'll be less of a control freak if I have a hobby. 'Just gives me something else to obsess about... \nMilo smiles as Gary sits down, studies the screen. \nGARY Anything we can salvage from the old code before you start fresh? \nMilo can't quite get over: Gary's his counselor. \nMILO Uh, might be one or two things. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.

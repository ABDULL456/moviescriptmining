The temple door closes with a solid boom. \nDREW Hey! What about my... \nThe temple door opens again, and out comes Drew's backpack. It lands next to him, but spews out a couple of pairs of underwear, and some socks. The people standing around laugh. Drew gathers up the clothing and stuffs it back into his pack. He sits there for a moment, then gets up and heads for the small shops and stands ringing the courtyard. He walks past a couple of the stalls, looking at the people running them. He doesn't see Ashema. He passes a tea stall, where one old man is sitting down sipping his tea. The old man looks at Drew and smiles, and Drew is about to walk on, when Ashema stands up from where she was squatting behind her stall. ASHEMA \nDrew? \nDREW \nHi. \nDrew sits down heavily, putting his pack down next to him. \nAshema places a cup of tea down in front of him, the steam rising from it. \nDREW (CONT'D) \nMake it a double.

ASHEMA You've had enough. \nDrew's shoulders slump even more. ASHEMA (CONT'D) Maybe it's for the best, Drew. You belong in America. New \nYork. DREW I have to do this. I can't go home, not until I'm a monk. I'd be even more of a disgrace... The old man talks to Ashema for the first time. He chatters in Chinese, motioning towards Drew. ASHEMA Not now, Bau Bau. DREW Bau Bau? ASHEMA \nMy nickname for him. He wants to tell you a story about the temple. \nThe grandfather keeps talking, even though Ashema and Drew really don't want to listen. \nASHEMA (CONT'D) \nHe is telling a story about a monk who was refused admission into the temple. It broke his heart not to be allowed to be a monk. \nDREW \nWhat did he do? \nAshema says something to him, and he continues in Chinese. \nASHEMA \nHe decided not to leave. He stayed in the courtyard until they let him in. \nDREW How long? ASHEMA A long time \u00ad through the worst weather. He just sat there, unmoving, through rain, sleet, snow. DREW Did they let him in? \nASHEMA No. (beat) Of course they did \u00ad what kind of story do you think my \nBau Bau would tell? He stayed in front of the temple until they could no longer say no. He went on to become one of the most famous monks in the history of the temple. Drew sits there, thinking, letting it all soak in. He then gets up and smiles. DREW Please tell your grandfather, your Bau Bau, he is a wise man. And that he tells a good story. The grandfather smiles at him, nodding his head. ASHEMA What are you going to do? Are you going home? Drew shakes his head. \n", "random": " don't want anyone to have to choose.

They    are about halfway across from the front door of the temple    when a    monk comes walking towards them.

They take refuge behind a couple of the columns and watch as the monk makes his way past, weaving and throwing kicks and punches. It is a tense moment as the monk comes uncomfortably close to where Drew and Gao are standing, but he walks on. \nGAO \n(whisper) Drunken Kung Fu... Drew nods and leads them out of the temple. EXT.

Nobody moves. \nDREW \nAre we men or are we sheep? \nA beat, then the entire group bellows: \nGROUP \nSHEEP! \nAnd they follow Drew, the shepherd, in through the front door, making noises like sheep. \nINT.

The disciples are all clustered together, staring at the walls and the ceiling. A group of giggle girls are standing around Drew and Ashema. A group of toughs are standing at one side of the party room, observing everything that's going on. ANGLE ON DREW AND ASHEMA DREW Great party... \nAshema smiles a sheepish smile. Drew decides that if they are going to have a good time, he's going to have a hand in it. He pulls out a cassette tape, gives it to Ashema \nDREW (CONT'D) Play this when I signal, OK? She nods and walks off. Drew motions for Gao and the guys to come over. They do, and when they do, Drew turns to the giggle girls DREW (CONT'D) Ladies, allow me to introduce my best friends in all of China... He drags Gao over to one of the prettier girls. DREW (CONT'D) This is Gao. And this wild man is Li... Drew does the same for Li, Wu, Su, Sou and all the others, forcing them to stand with the girls for a moment.

The hand comes in again, punching Drew in the shoulder hard. \nDrew opens his eyes, and sees that he is surrounded by five tough guys, dressed in dark clothes and with sunglasses on. \nDREW (CONT'D) What can I do for you? TOUGH \nLeave. ANGLE ON DISCIPLES. They have noticed what is going on. ANGLE ON DREW DREW No, thanks. He turns back to Ashema, but she is pulled back by the giggle girls, away from danger. The tough spins Drew around and pushes him HARD. One of the toughs has already gotten behind him, on his knees, and Drew goes flipping over the tough, landing hard on the ground, the wind knocked out of him. \nDrew gets up, wincing, not really ready to fight. \nDREW (CONT'D) \n", "random": "                                                                                                   ", "sentiment": "Total corrects myself  I'm not coming over here alone and you're quite right.

The scroll that is in this box is more precious than life. Guard it well. DREW I will, Master. SAN DE If you deliver this, you may ask this master, the most advanced monk of the Shaolin tradition, any question you wish, and he must answer it. San De takes out a map of the area.

Drew, not looking for trouble, bends down to pick up the glass, and the leader kicks him in the rear end, sending him pitching to the \nground. Drew rolls to a standing position, and the five men close on him. A crowd is now starting to form, eager to watch how the monk handles this situation. The thugs come after Drew, and the leader throws a roundhouse punch, hitting Drew square in the jaw. They continue to attack, while Drew tries to avoid getting hit. Drew catches a haymaker, and he spins and drops, and the thugs laugh, kick him a couple of times, and then kick dust and dirt onto him. Drew doesn't get up.

He was standing close to his dog, motioning to it not to make a noise. The dog's name is Jack. \nIn the same area, we've also seen the lead actress. Her name is Constance Gray. She too looks tense and is latched onto the arm of a pleasant-looking man who is chewing anxiously on a cigar. The man looks rich, but a little weak. He's surely the producer. \n10   INT.

KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY        18 \nIn his dressing room, wearing a tailcoat and top hat, George is finishing putting his make up on. He has a white face and dark lips and eyes. His chauffeur is signing autographs for him on full length photographs of himself (George) with his dog. George says to him: \nTitle card: Go and buy a piece of jewelry for my wife. A nice piece, to make it up to her. \nThe chauffeur nods. Having finished his mask up, George, picks up a photo, looks at it closely and then writes on it. As he leaves the dressing room, we see the photograph. He's written Woof Woof on it, and signed it with the paw print of a dog. \n19    INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - RESTAURANT DECOR SET - DAY          19 \nWe're on a film set, the crew is setting up a shot.

The producer whom we saw the previous day at the premi\u00e8re arrives. His name is Zimmer, and he's flanked by - and followed around at every moment by - two secretaries and two assistants. One of them hands him The Hollywood Reporter, and Zimmer, before he's even come to a halt, talks to George as he shows him the front page. He is visibly upset. George looks a lot more relaxed, he says hello and vaguely tries to reassure him. But Zimmer persists, still pointing at the newspaper. \nTitle card: Because of this childish nonsense, there's nothing about the film before page 5! \nBehind George, the two set hands come back with a new screen of sky scenery, and wait, standing just next to George. As they are holding it, there is a three foot gap underneath. While the producer is talking to him, George's attention is drawn by a lovely pair of women's legs that have come to stand behind the screen, the top half of the body being hidden by it. George acknowledges the sight with a smile and is about to bring his attention back to the on-going discussion, when his attention is drawn away again by a noise, that of the tap steps the female legs are making, presumably as a warm up. George smiles in recognition and responds with a few tap steps of his own. The women's legs instantly stop, seem to think a moment and then answer back, but with a jump in the complexity of the steps. A tap dialogue ensues between the two pairs of legs, until the set hands - the path before them now cleared - pick up their screen of scenery and walk off with it. The screen moves away and as it disappears reveals that the upper body belongs to a young woman. She pulls a face meaning 'Here I am!!' And of course it's Peppy, except that she immediately realizes who she is dealing with - visibly she wasn't expecting this at all - and feels completely ridiculous and uncomfortable. \n", "random": "  INT.

The cop has no idea what's happened, he crouches down and touches the dog to see if it's all right. Jack wakes up and goes to leave but stops immediately to show the cop he wants to take him with him. The cop still doesn't understand, it's the woman who tells him what he must do.

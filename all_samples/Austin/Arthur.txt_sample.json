Sorry, but that transaction will take place over my dead body, and I'm feeling rather well today. \nINT. SHOWER - DAY \nArthur's still peering down through his binoculars. \nARTHUR (O.S.) Hobson! That was your birthday present! You like bears! \nA PRIEST WITH THIN SIDEBURNS emerges from A DINER... \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Father Wolverine... \nA MASTURBATING MAN IN A 70TH STORY APARTMENT OPPOSITE... \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Wank Williams...That man has the constitution of an ox. \nHobson glances up at Arthur, washing himself on the screen. \nHOBSON That reminds me, clean your genitals. Heaven knows what wildlife that girl was harbouring between her thighs. \nINT. ARTHUR'S DOJO. DAY - LATER \nArthur, in expensive baggy yoga pants and collarless shirt, is doing self-invented yoga to Indian `meditation' music. \nARTHUR I give you `Sideways farting spider'. \nHobson is sitting, exasperated, going through various expenditures. \nHOBSON Arthur, you have to stop giving money away! \nARTHUR I'm a philanthropist. \nHOBSON With the emphasis on the `pissed'. Really, what is it about unearned wealth that brings out such idiocy in those who have it and those who want it? The way you're going, you'll have spent your inheritance before you've inherited it. \nARTHUR (shifts to new pose) `Eagle pointing at lesbian.' \nHOBSON Why did you fire Jessica? \nARTHUR What kind of yoga teacher won't let a pupil invent positions? She was a Nazi with a pan pipe C.D. (CHANGING POSE) `Upwards Pooping Astronaut'. \nHOBSON Interesting. It looks more like `Rich twit hiding from mother.' May I remind you, she finances your preposterous existence... \nARTHUR I know, I know. Never bite the hand that fists me. \nEXT. MANHATTAN - DAY \nArthur and Hobson are in a huge Bentley. Marty's at the wheel, still in his Cubs shirt but sporting a chauffeur's cap and tie. As he drives, he checks a bleeping sports pager. He nearly hits a pedestrian, then goes back to the pager. \nMARTY Sorry, fellas. \nHOBSON (CONSPIRATORIAL) You don't seriously intend to keep employing this gentleman? \nARTHUR Give the guy a chance, Hobson. He got laid off in Chicago... \nHOBSON But he doesn't know his way around New York! \nARTHUR So? I want interesting, fun people around me, not drones who just get the job done... \nArthur sees something out of the window. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Marty! Stop the car! \nMarty hits the brakes, pitching Arthur and Hobson forward. \nEXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT \nArthur hurries up to A SMALL GROUP OF TOURISTS. \nWOMAN (O.S.) The Chrysler Building. Designed by William Van Allen... \nA TOUR GUIDE wearing a name badge reading `Naomi' is talking. She is gorgeous, wearing vintage clothes, clutching a clipboard. We understand why Arthur stopped the car. \nNAOMI ...and inspired by the machine age of the 1920s, this magnificent structure was the world's tallest building for 11 months before the Empire State stole its thunder. \nShe looks out on her sullen, miserable tourists. \nNAOMI (CONT'D) The Chrysler got its name when the builder went bust in the 1928 Cement Famine and had to melt down his Chrysler to make the pointy bit at the top. If you peer closely you can still make out remnants of a hub cap and a sticker reading `Honk twice if you voted Hoover.' \nSome tourists laugh. Some don't. Arthur's transfixed. \n", "random": "(to Forrest) How long have you been in the game? \n(to Archie) Eight years. \n(to Archie) So, you're going to be the one to take her down? \nForty years? \n(to Archie) I like that.

PIERRE HOTEL - DAY - CONTINUOUS PASSERSBY are staring in horror at a yellow cab, its roof caved in, the DRIVER shaking in shock. Tilt up to find Hobson's HUGE teddy BEAR lying on the roof. ", "truth": "Arthur's on his phone again. \nARTHUR (leaving a message) Naomi? I doubt you'll ever get this, because your voicemail probably consists of a 4000 year old woman who writes the message down in hieroglyphics then loses it down the back of her incontinence loin cloth. Hobson died. Hobson died and I've fallen apart... \nThe doorbell rings from off. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Marty! Can you get that? Marty! (INTO PHONE) Naomi? Could you get it? Hello? \nHe throws the cellphone off the roof. A couple of seconds pass. We hear a very faint howl of pain from whoever it hit. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nArthur opens the door. It's Vivienne. \nVIVIENNE Arthur! You haven't answered the phone for eight days. Susan's beside herself. What's going on? \nARTHUR What do you think's going on? Hobson died. \nVIVIENNE Oh, that. \nShe bustles in past Arthur. A PLATOON OF MAIDS follows. \nVIVIENNE (CONT'D) (TO MAIDS) Chop chop! You cleany penthouseio! Come on, Arthur. Have to pick yourself up, lad. It's like when Nixon my Great Dane had to be put down. Frightful state for days. But I pulled myself together. \nARTHUR You're comparing Hobson to...a dog? \nVIVIENNE Well, yes. A faithful, humble companion who... \nARTHUR Um, I think I'd like you to leave, if that's okay. Now? \nVIVIENNE Remember who pays for this apartment, Arthur. For everything! \nHe guides her out the door. \nVIVIENNE (CONT'D) You had damn well better be at that wedding, boy. \nARTHUR Don't worry. If I'm going to drink myself to death I'll need resources. Bye Vivienne... \nVIVIENNE It's mother! \nARTHUR My mother's dead. \nHe slams the door. The phone rings again. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Hello? I'm sorry? \nINT. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nArthur is sitting in an estate attorney's next to MR FINKE, a small, dirty man. ATTORNEY MARGARET AHERNE is at a desk opposite them, reading from a will. \nAHERNE The last will and testament of Jane Hobson. (READS) `I leave my life savings to the Tulare Bear Sanctuary, Tulare County, California.' \nAherne hands Mr Finke A CHECK for $8,864. \nARTHUR That'll explain the strong smell of bear shit. Sorry. \nAherne opens a tiny envelope. \nAHERNE To Arthur Bach Templemead, I leave this. \nShe produces a teabag. \nAHERNE (CONT'D) To operate kettle, press red button. Milk in refrigerator; that's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door. (PAUSE) Arthur. You're going to be okay. Now it's your turn to look after someone. All my deepest, fondest love, my dearest boy. I'm smiling down at you - or more likely, up at you - forever and ever, H xxxxxxxx. \nINT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY \nClose up on the KETTLE, steam issuing forth from the spout. Then a MUG with the teabag in it. The kettle boils. A hand pours hot water into the mug. Milk is added. And a drop of vodka. \nEXT. CHURCH - DAY \nBurt and Vivienne are standing outside, greeting GUESTS. \nBURT I just want you to know, if he doesn't show up for this wedding, I can't know what I'll do. \nVIVIENNE Don't worry, Burt. He's cleaned himself up. He's stopped drinking, he's anxious to get a real job. He's become a responsible citizen. \nEXT. FIFTH AVENUE - DAY \nArthur is stalking - drunk but determined - through the crowds. He comes upon a group of tourists standing by a tour bus. Naomi's now wearing a headset mic, pointing south. \nNAOMI Due to a tragic error in the architect's drawing, the original Statue of Liberty unveiled in 1886 was just seven inches tall. 100,000 New Yorkers rioted, having come expecting to see something more impressive than a garden gnome holding up an ice cream... \n", "random": "IMOTHY We're out here. \nTIMOTHY You're going to have to take it to the bathroom, you can't you? \nTIMOTHY No, I'm going to have to take it to the bathroom.

Stop it! Why are you doing that? ", "truth": "ARTHUR No, you keep still. \nHe kisses Naomi passionately. \nNAOMI What are we going to do, Arthur? \nARTHUR I'll get a job. I'll model cheap riding boots for people with no horses. You can write books about boys whose lungs have run away. \nVIVIENNE Stop this! \nVivienne walks up to the altar. \nVIVIENNE (CONT'D) A Bach-Templemead has never been poor and we're not about to try that experiment with you, Arthur. That said, you've shown strength of character for once, instead of blubbing on about frogs and friendship. The inheritance is yours. All I ask is, with Hobson gone, you finally start treating me like a mother. \nARTHUR Sorry, Vivienne. I can't do that. \nVIVIENNE I beg your pardon? \nARTHUR You've never earned that title. I wouldn't fake it with Susan. I won't with you. \nVIVIENNE Arthur. I will withdraw this offer forever. Don't doubt me, boy. \nARTHUR I don't. \nArthur shakes Vivienne's hand. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) Take care, Viv. \nArthur takes Naomi by the hand and they leave the church. \nVIVIENNE Arthur! Arthur! I am serious! If you walk out of that door... \nThey're gone. Vivienne sits in a pew. For once she looks small, old, alone. \nEXT. CHURCH - DAY \nArthur and Naomi step into the daylight, pushing past paparazzi and press. Marty is waiting in the Batmobile, now repaired. \nARTHUR Sorry, Marty. This isn't mine any more. Fancy joining us for a bowl of Special J? \nMarty gets out. The three walk away up Amsterdam Avenue. \nFADE OUT \nEXT. QUEENS - NIGHT \nCAPTION: ONE MONTH LATER \nARTHUR (O.S.) OW! \nINT. NAOMI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nNaomi's typing, sipping `Sprike' (fake Sprite). Beside her is a printed manuscript titled `SNART'S FAKE NEW YORK - A Bogus guide to the World's Greatest City.' On the computer screen is: `...the 1765 Irish Hair Famine swept through Manhattan, rendering every resident bald for a week.' \nARTHUR (O.S.) This is outrageous! \nINT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. SHOWER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nArthur's struggling with a very crap, piddly shower. Rather than the glory of Manhattan from his shower-in-the-sky, Arthur just has a bare wall opposite to look out on. \nARTHUR Operational heat controls in a shower are a basic human right! \nA hole in a pipe sprays his groin with hot water. He screams. \nINT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nRalph and Marty sit watching sports, Marty cheering as the Yankees are losing, Ralph miserable, The doorbell rings. \nINT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM DOOR. NIGHT \nRalph stands hammering at the bathroom door, holding a package. \nARTHUR (O.S.) Owww! My eyes! I'm blind! \nRalph hammers again. The bathroom door opens. Arthur's holding a giant bottle of cheap shampoo. His eyes are bright red, streaming. \nARTHUR (CONT'D) What the hell's in this shampoo? Napalm? It sure as hell isn't tea tree oil... \nRalph hands him the package. \nRALPH Package for you.

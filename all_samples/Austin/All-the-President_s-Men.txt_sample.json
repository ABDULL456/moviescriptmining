WOODWARD eats a hamburger, BERNSTEIN smokes, sips coffee. It is night, as usual now. \nCUT TO: \nNIXON--on the tube. \nNIXON ...What really hurts in matters of this sort is not the fact that they occur, because overzealous people in campaigns do things that are wrong. What really hurts is if you try to cover it up. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN as the news commentator come on, begins introducing another story. \nWOODWARD Did he just say what I think he said? \nBERNSTEIN You voted for him. \nHe gives WOODWARD a big smile.

As she looks at her sister-- \nBOOKKEEPER'S SISTER This here is Carl Bernstein-- \nBOOKKEEPER --omigod, you're from that place, you've got to go. \nThe sister is smoking and there is a pack on the dinette table. \nBERNSTEIN Could I bum one of your cigarettes?-- \nAs the sister starts for the pack-- \nBERNSTEIN --don't bother, I'll get it. \nAnd he crosses ten feet inside the front door. \nBOOKKEEPER You've really got to go. \nBERNSTEIN Just let me get a match. \nHe goes into the living room area, picks up a book of matches. This whole scene moves slowly, the tension building under it-- it's not like news people talking, nothing overlaps here. \nBERNSTEIN But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through. \nBOOKKEEPER All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff? \nBERNSTEIN We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax. \nBOOKKEEPER (tense) I'm relaxed--light your cigarette. \nBERNSTEIN lights the cigarette. \nBERNSTEIN You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse? \nBOOKKEEPER I never worked for Sloan or Stans. \nBOOKKEEPER'S SISTER (out of the blue; to BERNSTEIN) Would you like some coffee or anything? \nAs the BOOKKEEPER winces. \nBERNSTEIN (like a shot) Please, yes, thank you.

SLOAN We're moving. (beat) I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much.

It's so easy to lose perspective. We want to get out before we lose ours altogether. \nSLOAN opens the front door. WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN pause, nod, almost an embarrassed pause. Then as they hurry out into the rain-- \nCUT TO: \nA NERFBALL \nflying toward a basket cupped to a picture window. When we \nPULL BACK \nwe're in BRADLEE's office, SIMONS and ROSENFELD are also there, along with WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN. BRADLEE plays nerfball mostly; he hasn't got the worlds's longest attention span. \nBERNSTEIN Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach. \nWOODWARD We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it. \nBRADLEE This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.

He verifies. \nBRADLEE OK. (now after the burst of talk, a pause) You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook. (throws the nerfball) Just be right, huh? \nAs WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN leave the office-- \nBRADLEE Leave plenty of room for his denial. \nCUT TO: \nBERNSTEIN AT HIS DESK ON THE PHONE. He has some papers in front of him an a notepad and pencil in his free hand. He is tired and very, very nervous. It is dark outside. In what follows, BERNSTEIN takes notes. \nOPERATOR'S VOICE (V.O.) Essex House, can I help you? \nBERNSTEIN John Mitchell, please. \nThere is a BUZZING SOUND. Then-- \nJOHN MITCHELL'S VOICE (V.O.) Yes? \nBERNSTEIN Sir, this is Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post, and I'm sorry to bother you but we're running a story in tomorrow's paper that we thought you should have a chance to comment on. \nMITCHELL (V.O.) What does it say? \nBERNSTEIN (starting to read) John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that-- \nMITCHELL (V.O.) --jeeeeeeesus-- \nBERNSTEIN --fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats-- \nMITCHELL (V.O.) --jeeeeeeesus-- \nBERNSTEIN --according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971-- \nMITCHELL (V.O.) --jeeeeeeesus-- \nBERNSTEIN --almost a year before he left the Justice Department-- \nMITCHELL (V.O.) --jeeeeeeeeesus-- \nBERNSTEIN --to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund-- \n", "random": "                                                                                                  ", "sentiment": "e do just that. \nHARTFORD (coughing, coughs) I thought I'd be able to work my way up your sleeve, but we are talking about a job. \nHARTFORD You're a nice guy, but I think you've got a life to live. \nHARTFORD (HADLY) I'm a good guy. \nCUT TO: \nHARTFORD'S VOICE: "}, {"id": 1721, "prefix": "WOODWARD in the shadows, coming closer.

He glances over as WOODWARD comes back down the ramp alone. \nDEEP THROAT (self-mocking) I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery. \nWOODWARD (impatiently) Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it? \nDEEP THROAT They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it. \nWOODWARD Why didn't they?--who told them not to? \nDEEP THROAT Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you? (coughs) Don't you know what you're onto? Come on. \nWOODWARD Mitchell knew then. \nDEEP THROAT Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman. \nWOODWARD Haldeman too? \nDEEP THROAT You get nothing from me about Haldeman? \nAnd from this tone, you know HALDEMAN scares him. \nWOODWARD Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after? \nDEEP THROAT Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines. \nWOODWARD Talk about Segretti-- \nDEEP THROAT --don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too. \nWOODWARD There were more then. \nDEEP THROAT Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere-- \nWOODWARD --the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation-- \nDEEP THROAT (nods, bigger) --don't you miss the grand scheme too. \nWOODWARD How grand? \nDEEP THROAT Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti. \nWOODWARD And Justice and FBI know all this? \nDEEP THROAT Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief. \nWOODWARD (stunned) Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats? \nCUT TO: \nDEEP THROAT \nDEEP THROAT I was being cautious.

EVENING                                  15 \nJenny is dressed up for her evening out. She looks good, but also stiff, uncomfortable - she's not herself in her dress, which looks too old for her.

I will. \nJENNY Good. \nJACK Where is it? \nJENNY St John's Smith Square. \nJACK Where's that? \nJENNY I don't know. I'm sure we could find out. \nMarjorie comes into the room. \nMARJORIE It's in Westminster. Just around the corner from the Abbey. \nJack looks at her as if she'd just given directions to the nearest opium den. \nJACK How d'you know that? \nMARJORIE I had a life before we were married, you know. \nJENNY He soon put a stop to that. \nJACK There we are. \nJENNY Where are we? \nJACK Near Westminster Abbey. I'm not going all the way over there. \nJENNY The trouble is, that's where St John's Smith Square is. \nJACK And I've just said. That's where I'm not going. There must be something on locally. Where's the paper? \nMARJORIE Jack, she wants to see someone who can play. She doesn't want to see Sheila Kirkland scratching away. I'll take her. \nJACK And how are you going to get over there? RAF helicopter? \nThe doorbell rings. \nJENNY That's him. Now what? \nJACK Oh, bloody hell. \nMARJORIE Jack! \nJenny starts towards the door, and then turns. \nJENNY Oh, and by the way...David's a Jew. A wandering Jew. So watch yourself. \nShe   goes to the door. \nJACK (panic-stricken and shouting) What's she talking about? I've never said anything like that in my life! Anyway, it's just an expression!

ST JOHN'S, SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT                        15A \nJenny and David walk toward the beautiful hall. Jenny suddenly looks young in the dress that looks too old for her - other adults are milling around outside, and the women don't look like girls dressed up. David makes for an incredibly glamorous and attractive couple in their late twenties who are waiting outside - DANNY and HELEN. Helen is as far from anyone's idea of an aunt as one can get. She's no more beautiful than Jenny, but she's dressed both appropriately and spectacularly, in early-60s, pre-hippy Bohemian gear. She turns heads in a way that Jenny is not yet able to. Danny too is attractive, but soberly so. David and Jenny are, in a way, paler, less striking versions of these two. \nDAVID Hello hello. Are we late? \nHELEN I was hoping we'd miss the beginning, and then it wouldn't be worth going in, and we could go off dancing or something. \nDANNY Helen is one of the more reluctant members of tonight's audience. \nJenny and David laugh politely. \nDAVID Jenny, these are my friends Helen and Danny. \nJenny shakes hands with the two of them. They both give her fascinated and clearly appraising looks. They have heard about her. \nDAVID (CONT'D) Shall we? \nThey walk into the hall. \n16   INT. ST JOHN'S SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT                         16 \nIt's a beautiful hall - Jenny is dazzled by the surroundings and the company. She's particularly bowled over by Helen. \nHELEN Look. We can leave our coats over there. I want to get rid of this. \nShe nods at the coat she's carrying. Jenny looks thrilled at the prospect of spending a couple of minutes with Helen. Danny hands Helen his coat, without saying anything. The girls walk over to another reception table a few yards away, behind which is a cloakroom. A lady is exchanging overcoats for tickets. Almost involuntarily, Jenny touches the sleeve of Helen's velvety jacket. She stops herself. Helen notices. \nJENNY I'm so sorry. \nHELEN (amused) That's OK. It's nice, isn't it? \nJENNY It's beautiful. Where did it come from? \nHELEN Oh, South Ken somewhere. \nHelen looks at Jenny's outfit, her frumpy `smart' dress, apparently wanting to return the compliment. \nHELEN (nodding at the dress) This is...Well, it's good for this sort of concert, isn't it? \nJENNY (quietly) Thank you. \nHelen is now at the front of the queue, and hands her coat over imperiously. \nHELEN We should go shopping together one day, if you want. \nShe takes a ticket from the cloakroom lady. \nJENNY That would be nice. But South Ken... C'est beaucoup trop cher pour moi. \nThey stare at each other. Helen is bewildered, Jenny embarrassed. \nHELEN Sorry? \nJENNY I just said....It was too expensive for me. \nHELEN No you didn't. You said something completely different. \nJENNY I just...Well, I said it in French. \nHELEN In French? Why? \nJenny feels humiliated; she is yet to realise what we can see - that Helen is simply very dim. \nJENNY I don't know. \nJenny looks away. Helen stares at her. The performance bell rings, and they make their way back to the men. To Jenny's surprise and pleasure, Helen links arms with her as they walk. \nHELEN Anyway. It's too expensive for me, too. We don't have to worry about that. If you want something in South Ken, get David to take you shopping. \nJENNY Why on earth would he want to take me shopping? \nHelen makes a knowing face. \n", "random": "\nINT.

But next time, eh? \nJENNY (disappointed) Hopefully I'll be there by then. So that won't be much use. \nJACK (dubiously) Well, I suppose...Would she have to stay the night? \nDAVID Well, I wouldn't want to drive back after one of those Oxford dinners. \nJack chuckles knowingly. \nDAVID Clive will get her a room in college. That's easy enough. \nMARJORIE Sounds like too good an opportunity to pass up. \nJENNY Please, Daddy.

Jenny is sitting at the dressing table, being made up by Helen. Jenny looks three or four years older, more sophisticated....more like Helen. She can't believe it.

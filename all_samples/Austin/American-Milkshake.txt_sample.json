You're way out of your league. \nHENRIETTA The league is about making money. Jolie, the only reason you even got on varsity is because your Dad paid for the new uniforms. You never would have made it even with Francisco getting arrested. Don't you realize that? \nJOLIE No he didn't. \nHENRIETTA Yes he did. They cost over two thousand dollars. How could you not know that? I mean you made Varsity at Blair after being cut from JV last year. When have you ever seen that happen? \nThe news hits Jolie hard. \nJOLIE That's not true.

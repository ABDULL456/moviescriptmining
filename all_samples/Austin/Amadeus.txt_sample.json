Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them. \nVOGLER Did you try? \nOLD SALIERI Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray! \nINT. SALIERI'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY - 1780'S \nThe young Salieri is kneeling in desperation before the Cross. \nSALIERI Please! Please! Send him away, back to Salzburg. For his sake as well as mine. \nCU, Christ staring from the Cross. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. AUDIENCE HALL - ARCHBISHOP'S PALACE - SALZBURG - DAY - 1780'S \nWe see Leopold kneeling now not to the Cross but to Archbishop Colloredo, sitting impassively on his throne. Count Arco stands beside him. Leopold is a desperate, once-handsome man of sixty, now far too much the subservient courtier. \nCOLLOREDO No! I won't have him back. \nLEOPOLD But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding. \nCOLLOREDO Hardly. \nLEOPOLD Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him. \nCOLLOREDO I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him. \nLEOPOLD Sir - \nCOLLOREDO Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat. \nLEOPOLD Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully. \nCOLLOREDO And how will you make him keep it? \nLEOPOLD Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance. \nCOLLOREDO You have leave to try. \nLEOPOLD Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you! \nIn deepest gratitude he kisses the Archbishop's hand. He motions Leopold to rise. We hear the first dark fortissimo chord which begins the Overture to Don Giovanni: the theme associated with the character of the Commendatore. \nLEOPOLD (V.O.) My dear son. \nThe second fortissimo chord sounds. \nINT. A BAROQUE CHURCH - DAY - 1780'S \nWe see a huge CU, of Mozart's head, looking front and down, as if reading his father's letter. We hear Leopold's voice over this image, no longer whining and anxious, but impressive. \nLEOPOLD (V.O.) I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming. \nMOZART I will. \nThe camera pulls back to see that he is in fact kneeling beside Constanze. A PRIEST faces them. Behind them are Madame Weber, Josefa and Sophie Weber, and a very few others. Among them, a merry looking lady in bright clothes: the BARONESS WALDSTADTEN. \nPRIEST And will you, Constanze Weber, take this man, Wolfgang to be your lawful husband? \nCONSTANZE I will. \nPRIEST I now pronounce you man and wife. \nThe opening kyrie of the great Mass in C Minor is heard. Mozart and Constanze kiss. They are in tears. Madame Weber and her daughters look on approvingly. The music swells and continues under the following: \nINT. A ROOM IN LEOPOLD'S HOUSE - SALZBURG - NIGHT - 1780'S \nThere is a view of a castle in background. Leopold sits alone in his room. He is reading a letter from Wolfgang. At his feet are his trunks, half-packed for the journey he will not now take. We hear Mozart's voice reading the following letter and we see, as the camera roves around the room, mementos of the young prodigy's early life: the little forte-piano made for him; the little violin made for him; an Order presented to him. We see a little starling in a wicker cage. And we see portraits of the boy on the walls, concluding with the familiar family portrait of Wolfgang and his sister Nannerl seated at the keyboard with Leopold standing, and the picture of their mother on the wall behind them. \nMOZART (V.O.) Most beloved father, it is done. Do not blame me that I did not wait to see your dear face. I knew you would have tried to dissuade me from my truest happiness and I could not have borne it. Your every word is precious to me. Remember how you have always told me Vienna is the City of Musicians. To conquer here is to conquer Europe! With my wife I can do it.  I vow I will become regular in my habits and productive as never before. She is wonderful, Papa, and I know that you will love her. And one day soon when I am a wealthy man, you will come and live with us, and we will be so happy. I long for that day, best of Papas, and kiss your hand a hundred thousand times. \nThe music of the Mass fades as Leopold crumples the letter in his hand. \nEXT. THE IMPERIAL GARDENS - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S \nSalieri stands waiting, hat in hand. Beside him stands a royal servant. Behind him, gardeners are glimpsed tending the shrubs and bushes along a grassy ride. Down this ride are seen cantering two people on horseback: the Emperor Joseph and his niece, the PRINCESS ELIZABETH. They are mounted on glossy horses. The Princess rides side-saddle. Running beside her is a panting groom. The Emperor rides elegantly; his niece, a dumpy little Hapsburg girl of sixteen, like a sack of potatoes. As they draw level with Salieri they stop, and the groom holds the head of the Princess' horse. Salieri bows respectfully. \nJOSEPH Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth. \nSALIERI Your Highness. \nOut of breath, the Princess nods nervously. \nJOSEPH She has asked me to advise her on a suitable musical instructor. I think I've come up with an excellent idea. \nHe smiles at Salieri. \nSALIERI Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour! \nJOSEPH I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view? \nSalieri's face falls, almost imperceptibly. \nSALIERI An interesting idea, Majesty. But - \nJOSEPH Yes? \nSALIERI You already commissioned an opera from Mozart. \nJOSEPH And the result satisfies. \nSALIERI Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism. \nJOSEPH Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart. \nSALIERI I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes. \nJOSEPH You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea. \n", "random": "alieri is asleep in the dirt floor of the room of Salieri's bed. He is looking out the window at a dark figure before him. He is looking like a black figure, but that is not what we are looking for. We are looking for an elderly woman. It is almost as if Salieri is dying. He is asleep. He is still weeping. We must hurry to the door and join him. We must wait for the door to be opened. We must not let", "sentiment": "t his bedside, Salieri's head is heavy with happiness, tears streaming down his face. We find him asleep, but he's awake. We watch the creatures' call. OLD SALIERI What do you want, dear? \nThe Creature moves to the front. As we watch, each of the creatures rushes into the room. Salieri's happy, and it seems to us that this little creature is very much alive. Salieri saw the creatures on a grand scale"}, {"id": 721, "prefix": "He sees his wife and father standing by in the crowd. Leopold is signaling insistently. MOZART Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour? JOSEPH What is it? ", "truth": "JOSEPH Ah! By all means. \nLeopold comes forward eagerly and fawningly kisses the royal hand. \nLEOPOLD Your Majesty. \nConstanze curtsies. \nJOSEPH Good evening. (to Leopold) We have met before, Herr Mozart. \nLEOPOLD That's right, Your Majesty. Twenty years ago. No, twenty-two! twenty- three! And I remember word for word what you said to me. You said - you said -- \nHe searches his memory. \nJOSEPH Bravo? \nLEOPOLD No! Yes, 'bravo,' of course 'bravo'! Everybody always says 'bravo' when Wolfi plays. Like the King of England. When we played for the King of England, he got up at the end and said, 'Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!' three times. Three bravo's. And the Pope four! Four bravo's from the Holy Father, and one 'bellissimo.' \nAll the courtiers around are looking at him. \nMOZART Father - \nLEOPOLD Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.' \nJOSEPH Ah-ha. Well. There it is. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ORSINI-ROSENBERG'S STUDY - DAY - 1780'S \nThe Director sits at his table with Salieri and Bonno. \nSALIERI I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Yes? \nSALIERI Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Italian? \nBONNO Aie! \nSALIERI And that's not all. He has chosen for his subject, Figaro. The Marriage of Figaro. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG You mean that play? \nSALIERI Exactly. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG He's setting that play to music? \nSALIERI Yes. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG You must be mad. \nBONNO What is this Marriage of Figaro? \nORSINI-ROSENBERG It's a French play, Kapellmeister. It has been banned by the Emperor. \nBONNO Hah! \nHe crosses himself, wide-eyed with alarm. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Are you absolutely sure? \nSALIERI I've seen the manuscript. \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Where? \nSALIERI Never mind. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN VON STRACK'S STUDY - DAY - 1780'S \nVON STRACK I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director? \nORSINI-ROSENBERG For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France. \nVON STRACK Oh yes, yes. And that was? \nORSINI-ROSENBERG Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor. \nVON STRACK Ah. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE EMPEROR'S STUDY - DAY - 1780'S \nThe Emperor stands in the middle of the room in close conversation with Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Von Swieten, and Bonno. Salieri is not present. A door opens and a lackey announces: \nLACKEY Herr Mozart. \nThey all turn. Mozart approaches, rather apprehensively, and kisses Joseph's hand. \nJOSEPH Sit down, gentlemen, please. \nThey all sit, save Mozart. The room suddenly looks like a tribunal. Joseph is in a serious mood. \nJOSEPH Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre? \nMOZART Yes, Sire. \nJOSEPH Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true? \nMOZART Who told you this, Majesty? \nJOSEPH It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true? \nMOZART Well, yes, I admit it is. \nJOSEPH Would you tell me why? \n", "random": "                                                                                                   ", "sentiment": "LAWIE What is it? \nMOZART My daughter, I am dearest dear and dear. \nLAWIE Do you not know that we are only known among the people of the 15 Romishes as the holy of holies? \nMOZART Yes you do. \nLAWIE Let me ask you. \nMOZART Mother, do you know that which we are doing? \nMOZART Yes, I do, I do"}, {"id": 722, "prefix": "CONSTANZE I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here. OFFICER (laying a hand on her arm) What are you talking about? CUT TO: ", "truth": "Mozart is sitting up in bed, propped against pillows. The coins lie on the coverlet; many candles burn in the necks of bottles. Salieri, without coat or wig, is seated at an improvised worktable. On it are blank sheets of music paper, quills, and ink. Also the score of the Requiem Mass as so far composed. Mozart is bright-eyed with a kind of fever. Salieri is also possessed with an obviously feverish desire to put down the notes as quickly as Mozart can dictate them. \nMOZART Where did I stop? \nSALIERI (consulting the manuscript) The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra. \nMOZART So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that? \nSALIERI Consigned to flames of woe. \nMOZART Do you believe in it? \nSALIERI What? \nMOZART A fire which never dies. Burning one forever? \nSALIERI Oh, yes. \nMOZART Strange! \nSALIERI Come. Let's begin. \nHe takes his pen. \nSALIERI Confutatis Maledictis. \nMOZART We ended in F Major? \nSALIERI Yes. \nMOZART So now - A minor. Suddenly. \nSalieri writes the key signature. \nMOZART The Fire. \nSALIERI What time? \nMOZART Common time. \nSalieri writes this, and continues now to write as swiftly and urgently as he can, at Mozart's dictation. He is obviously highly expert at doing this and hardly hesitates. His speed, however, can never be too fast for Mozart's impatient mind. \nMOZART Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A. (singing the note) Con-fu-ta-tis. (speaking) Second measure, second beat. (singing) Ma-le-dic-tis. (speaking) G-sharp, of course. \nSALIERI Yes. \nMOZART Third measure, second beat starting on E. (singing) Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis. (speaking) And fourth measure, fourth beat - D. (singing) Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis. (speaking) Do you have that? \nSALIERI I think so. \nMOZART Sing it back. \nSalieri sings back the first six measures of the bass line. After the first two measures a chorus of basses fades in on the soundtrack and engulfs his voice. They stop. \nMOZART Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C. (singing) Con-fu-ta-tis. (speaking) Second measure, fourth beat on D. (singing) Ma-le-dic-tis. (speaking) All right? \nSALIERI Yes. \nMOZART Fourth measure, second beat - F. (singing) Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis. \nHis voice is lost on the last words, as tenors engulf it and take over the soundtrack, singing their whole line from the beginning, right to the end of the sixth measure where the basses stopped, but he goes on mouthing the sounds with them. Salieri writes feverishly. We see his pen jotting down the notes as quickly as possible: the ink flicks onto the page. The music stops again. \nMOZART Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm. (He hurriedly hums the opening notes of the bass vocal line) The first bassoon and tenor trombone - \nSALIERI (labouring to keep up) Please! Just one moment. \nMozart glares at him, irritated. His hands move impatiently. Salieri scribbles frantically. \nMOZART It couldn't be simpler. \nSALIERI (finishing) First bassoon and tenor trombone - what? \nMOZART With the tenors. \nSALIERI Also identical? \nMOZART Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant. \nHe again hums the bass vocal line from the beginning, conducting. On the soundtrack, we hear the second bassoon and bass trombone play it with him and the first bassoon and tenor trombone come in on top, playing the tenor vocal line. We also hear the trumpets and timpani. The sound is bare and grim. It stops at the end of the sixth measure. Salieri stops writing. \nSALIERI And that's all? \nMOZART Oh no. Now for the Fire. (he smiles) Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this. \nHe sings the urgent first measure of the ostinato. \nMOZART (speaking) Second measure on B. \nHe sings the second measure of the ostinato. \nMOZART (speaking) Do you have me? \nSALIERI I think so. \nMOZART Show me. \nSalieri sings the first two measures of the string ostinato. \nMOZART (excitedly) Good, good - yes! Put it down. And the next measures exactly the same, rising and rising - C to D to E, up to the dominant chord. Do you see? \nAs Salieri writes, Mozart sings the ostinato from the beginning, but the unaccompanied strings overwhelm his voice on the soundtrack, playing the first six bars of their agitated accompaniment. They stop. \nSALIERI That's wonderful! \nMOZART Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed. \nHe is now sitting bolt upright, hushed and inspired. \nMOZART C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above. (singing the alto part) Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis. \nSALIERI Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'? \n", "random": "NT. NINTENDO DE MONTENZO - NIGHT \nCUT TO: \nINT.

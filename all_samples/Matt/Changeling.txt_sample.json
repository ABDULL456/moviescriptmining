Everything's dark, silent. One officer runs into the house, there's a long pause...then he pokes his head out again. \nOFFICER All clear. \nYbarra goes back to the car, opens the door.   Sanford emerges. \nYBARRA All right.     Show me. \nSanford hesitates, then starts toward a nearby barn. \nINT. BARN - CONTINUOUS \nHe slides the door open and walks to the far end. The dirt here is a strange white-yellow color. Ybarra follows, still keeping a wary eye out for trouble. He looks down at where Sanford has stopped. Several bags marked LYE are nearby. \nYBARRA This it?   You're sure? \nSanford nods.   Ybarra edges toward a shovel, hands it to him. \nYBARRA Dig. (off sanford's look) You put 'em in the ground, you can take 'em out of the ground. Go on. \nSanford takes the shovel and starts cutting out sections of dirt and lye, dust rising around them. Ybarra watches, pensively, as the other officers edge their way in. He's looking the other way when one of the officers reacts: \nOFFICER Holy god.... \nYbarra glances back...to see a child's shoe being unearthed. And beside it...bones.

Go on.... \nThe officer races out of the barn as Ybarra looks to Sanford, who is still digging, crying as he goes. \nYBARRA You can stop now, son. (he doesn't) You can stop now. It's over. We can take it from here. It's over. \nSobbing, Sanford drops the shovel and collapses on the ground, hands covering his face, crying in great, heaving sobs. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.

I'm a terror at Scrabble, crossword puzzles, but even I'm in awe of the vocabulary that the press and the city council have been exercising in reference to this department courtesy of the Christine Collins...incident. (scans papers) Incompetent. Cowardly. Bullying. Reprehensible. Mendacious and invidious...those two courtesy of that prick Gustav Briegleb. Bonus words in Scrabble, both of them.

You have to do that in scrabble, you know, when somebody challenges a word...show how it's used in a sentence. So \"incompetent,\" as in -- (reads) \"A department so incompetent that they never realized that up to twenty children were being kidnapped and murdered under their very noses.\" (looks over) And here: \"So incompetent that they insisted they knew better than a mother the identity of her own child, forced him upon her, and then incarcerated her when she confronted them with evidence of their own reprehensible behavior.\" That was a two-fer. Incompetent and reprehensible in the same sentence. Guy must be a real terror at crossword puzzles. \nDavis gets up and crosses the room, looking out through the slatted windows at the busy Los Angeles street outside. \nDAVIS Captain, your handling of the Collins case has exposed this department to public ridicule. There is even the potential for civil and criminal liability. JONES Sir, nobody could have known what was going on up at that ranch. Not us, not the Sheriff's Department, the Marshall's Office...as for the Collins woman....

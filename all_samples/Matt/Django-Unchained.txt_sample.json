Amongst your inventory, I've been led to believe, is a specimen I'm keen to acquire. (to the slaves) Hello you poor devils. Is there one among you, who was formerly a resident of The Carrucan Plantation? Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness. In the darkness a VOICE rings out; ", "truth": "DJANGO Django. Dr.SCHULTZ Wunderbar! You're exactly the one I'm looking for. So tell me Django - by the way that's a amazing name - during your time at the Carrucan Plantation, did you come to know three overseers by the name of The Brittle Brothers? Django nods his head, yes. Dr.Schultz is delighted. Dr.SCHULTZ Big John, Ellis, and little brother Raj? \nDJANGO Dem da Brittle Brothers. Dr.SCHULTZ So Django, do you think you could recognize - \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd. The Speck Brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage their Slave in polite conversation.. .with a touch of disbelief. \nACE SPECK Hey, stop talkin' to him like that! Dr.SCHULTZ Like what? \nACE SPEC Like that! Dr.SCHULTZ My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain \nACE SPECK Speak English, goddamit! Dr.SCHULTZ Everybody calm down! I'm simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction. \nACE SPECK I don't care, no sale. Now off wit ya! Dr.SCHULTZ Don't be ridiculous, of course they're for sale. Ace raises his rifle towards the German. \nACE SPECK Move it! Ace cocks back the rifle hammer. Dr.SCHULTZ My good man, did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture, or are you pointing that weapon at me with lethal intention...? \nACE SPECK Last chance, fancy pants Dr.SCHULTZ - Very well - The doctor, throws his lantern to the ground, enveloping him in darkness. The next FLASH OF LIGHT we see is the good doctors PISTOL out of his holster, and FIRING point blank into Ace Specks face... .BLOWING the dumber dumb brother off his horse, dead in the dirt. \nBefore Dicky can maneuver either his rifle or his horse in the Germans direction... \nBAM... Dr.SCHULTZ SHOOTS his HORSE in the head... .The Steed goes down taking Dicky with him... When the dead weight horse lands on Dicky's slightly twisted leg, we hear TWO DISTINCT CRACKING SOUNDS.:.. Dicky lets out a bitch like scream. The Slaves watch all this. They've never seen a white man kill another white man before. Dicky is pinned down under his ole paint. Django watches in the dark, the German climb down off his horse, pick up Ace's discarded lantern, and walk over to the remaining Speck. Dr.SCHULTZ Sorry about putting a bullet in your beast. But I didn't want you to do anything rash before you had a moment to come to your senses. Dr.Sch.ultz LIGHTS the lantern, illuminating himself, as he stands over Dicky's body. \nDICKY SPECK You goddamn son of a bitch, you killed Ace! Dr.SCHULTZ. I only shot your brother, once he threatened to shoot me. And I do believe I have ... \n(COUNTING OUT \nTHE SLAVES) .one, two, three, four, five, six, seven witnesses who can attest to that fact. \nDICKY SPECK My damn legs busted! Dr.SCHULTZ No doubt. Now, if you can keep your caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like to finish my line of inquiry with young Django. \n(TO DJANGO) As I was saying, if you were to see the Brittle Brothers again, would you recognize them? \nDJANGO Yes. \nDr.SCHULTZ Now I'm sure. to you, all unshaven white men look alike. So Django, in a crowd of unshaven white men, can you honestly and positively point out The Brittle Brothers? \nDJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK We're in his little shack at the Carrucan Plantation. It's PISSING RAIN outside. Django is making love to his wife Broomhilda, when she stops letting out a shout. The three overseers known as THE BRITTLE BROTHERS are outside peeking in through the window. They BURST in through the front door. Soaked to the bone, they rodeo bull their way into the shack, and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement. As Django and Broomhilda are forced to copulate, they run their wet white hands down her chocolate leg.. .they fondle his ass.. .they squeeze her tit. . .they bring a belt across Django's backside to make him fuck faster. . .then they yank him off, as BIG JOHN climbs on top of Broomhilda..the other Brittle brothers whip Django with their belts, and make him sit in the corner, while they finish with his wife. \nBACK TO DJANGO \nDJANGO I can point 'em out. Dr.SCHULTZ Sold American! So Mr.Speck, how much for Django? \nDICKY SPECK I'm gonna lose this leg! Dr.SCHULTZ Yes, unless you find a talented physician very quickly, I'm afraid that will be the. end result. But back to business, how much do you want for Django? \nDICKY SPECK You go to hell! Dr.SCHULTZ Don't be silly. How much for Django? \nDICKY SPECK 800 dollars! Dr.SCHULTZ Oh come now, I may not have the experience in the slave trade that you and your family does, but neither was I born yesterday. \nThe. good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket. Dr.SCHULTZ In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says that the going rate for African flesh' - in particularly a field nigger -_is sixty to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger. Which according to\"this pamphlet here - and why would they lie - puts his price at eighty dollars. So in light of that, how bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for young Django here. Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver. Dr.SCHULTZ And since your late brother. won't be using it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag. He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on Dicky's body. He bends down and, puts the paper money-.in the saddle bags on Dicky's dead horse. With.his hands in there, he roots around and finds the keys to-the leg irons. He unlocks Django's leg irons. Django is free. Dr.SCHULTZ There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good rubbing, then get up on that horse. Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind. Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm jacket over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse. Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground. Dr.SCHULTZ Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a bill of sale. Do you have one? Dicky just curses him. He says, removing a notebook from his pocket; Dr.SCHULTZ I thought not. No worries, I come prepared. (as he writes) This will serve nicely as a bill of sale. (he stops, then says to Django) Django is spelled with a silent \"D\", is it not? \nDJANGO Huh? Dr.SCHULTZ Why not.. He writes it in his book with a silent \"D\", then stops to admire the way it looks. Dr.SCHULTZ Yes, that does add a little character. The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen. Dr.SCHULTZ If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your mark here. The. Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face. The good doctor wipes his face with a handkerchief. Then takes out a pocket knife. And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear. He signs the bill of sale. Dr.SCHULTZ Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a pleasure doing business with you, but your customer service leaves a lot to be desired. The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six Slaves, in leg irons. Dr.SCHULTZ Now as to you poor devils. He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles. Dr.SCHULTZ So as I.see it, when it comes to the subject of what to do next, you gentlemen have two choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him to the nearest town. Which would be at least thirty-seven miles back the way you came. Or ... .Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head, bury the two of them deep, and make your way to a more enlightened area of the country. The choice is yours. He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds; \nDr.SCHULTZ Oh, and on the off chance that there's any astronomy aficionados amongst you, the North Star is THAT ONE. Tata. He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse. Dr.SCHULTZ Just give him a little kick. Django does, and the horse responds by moving. Dr.SCHULTZ See, it's not so difficult. \nEXT - MORNING TEXAS LANDSCAPE - SUNRISE The DAWN BREAKS on a western landscape. The two men ride their horses silently, horse hooves CLIP-CLOPPING among the rocks. Django wears Specks winter coat, with one of Dr.Schultz's white button down dress shirts underneath it. As they ride through the picturesque scene... Dr.Schultz breaks the silence. Dr.SCHULTZ So, Django, what do you intend to name him? \nDJANGO Who? Dr.SCHULTZ Your horse? \nDJANGO What horse? Dr.SCHULTZ' The horse you're riding. \nDJANGO This ain't my horse. Dr.SCHULTZ Yes it is. \nDJANGO No it ain't, it's your horse. I'm just riding it. Dr.SCHULTZ Well, technically, yes - Wait a minute - technically not. If it's my horse, I can give it to you, and as of now, I'm doing such. Django, you're now the proud owner of a horse, congratulations. \nDJANGO I can't feed no horse. I can't put no horse up in no stable. Dr.SCHULTZ \n(FRUSTRATED) Don't worry about all that! They ride a bit longer in silence.. .the good doctor composes himself... then says with a smile; Dr.SCHULTZ So... . now that that's settled... . what do you intend to name it? Half the fun of having a horse is choosing his name. For instance my steed is named Fritz. He's stubborn, ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but I couldn't do without him. (he pats Fritz's neck) Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't something one does lightly. So once you've thought about it for awhile - \nDJANGO - Tony. Dr.SCHULTZ - Tony what? \nDJANGO - I dunno, Tony the horse. Dr.SCHULTZ Oh, you mean you want to name your horse Tony? \nDJANGO Yeah. That's what you jus' asked me, right? Dr.SCHULTZ When you're right you're right, indeed I did. Why Tony? \n", "random": " ACE SPECK (to the slaves) You can't believe it! (to the slaves) I'm telling you, that's just what they think.

Mark my words Schultz, by tomorrow morning your niggers gonna be stripped and clipped and hangin' from my motherfuckin' gate.

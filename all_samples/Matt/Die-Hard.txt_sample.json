NAKATOMI LOBBY - NIGHT                           13 \nBeautiful and -- on first glance -- deserted.  Finally a SOUND in the sterile lobby reveals the presence of a SECURITY GUARD hidden until now behind a massive desk. McClane goes there, signs in. \nMCCLANE Holly McClane? \nThe Guard points to a prominent touch screen computer console. \nGUARD Just type it in there. \nMcClane is confused for a moment, then he moves to the screen. He gives the Guard a look...the Guard raises his eyebrows as if to say give it a try. \n13-A    SCREEN - CLOSER                                       13-A \nMcClane types, \"McClane, Holly\".

He moves to the elevators, and as he does his experienced eye takes in: \n13-E    ANOTHER SECURITY GUARD                                 13-E \nPatrolling a different area. \n13-F    SEVERAL HI-TECH CAMERAS AND SENSORS                    13-F \nwhich are cleverly worked into the decor of the lobby. \n13-G    BACK TO SCENE                                          13-G \nMcClane reacts with bored professionalism, NODS to the guard. \nMCCLANE Lots of hardware... \nThe guard shrugs.

He rotates his head, getting out the travel cricks. \nAs he approaches the 30th floor we hear a tremendous THUMPING, THROBBING NOISE.  McClane stops and listens before he realizes -- it's the party.  As the doors open the noise ATTACKS us. \n15      30TH FLOOR - SAME                                      15 \nMcClane moves around the edge of the party, gradually spiraling inward.  He grabs a glass of Mimosa champagne punch from a passing tray, sips...scowls.  Spotting open beers in an ice bucket, he tosses the punch into a potted plant, even burying the plastic glass.  Sipping the beer, he moves through the dense party.  People he doesn't know throw streamers over him. \nA WOMAN kisses him.  He grins.  A MAN kisses him. \nMCCLANE (to himself, shaking his head) California... \nFinally he queries a DANCING WOMAN.  The MUSIC drowns out their words but she nods, points off in some generic direction. \nMcClane heads that way, cuts around a Christmas tree, loses his bearings.

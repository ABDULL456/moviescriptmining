I want to sue the guy who broke my ribs. I want to sue their government and their Mossad... and I want to sue Golda Meir! ", "truth": "They stand at the barbeque as Joey plays shooting hoops. Ramirez holds Yolanda. Ramirez and Jack speak quietly. \nJACK Mrs. Meir is dead, Lieutenant Commander. \nRAMIREZ Then you might want to have them dig her up because I intend to sue her. \nJack chuckles. \nJACK Commander Ramirez when I said I was from the government, perhaps I should have been more specific. I'm from the CIA. \nJack reaches down, opens his briefcase and pulls out a large photo album-like briefing book. He opens it up and hands it to Ramirez. On the first page there is an 8\u00d710 enlargement of a photo of Carlos entering a building. It is grainy but it certainly looks exactly like Ramirez. \nJACK Does the man in that picture look familiar? \nRamirez looks at the picture with the same look on his face that Jack had when he saw Ramirez for the first time. \nYOLANDA Poppi... \nRAMIREZ That's not me... I mean I know it looks like me... but... \nJACK I know it's not you. \nRAMIREZ It's... this Carlos guy. \nJust then, Joey yells from the tree he's in. Jack automatically hides the picture as if the kid were from a rival intelligence agency. \nJOEY Poppi, you don't need to watch the fire, come climb with me. \nRAMIREZ Get out of that tree, Joey. Your mother sees that and I'm dead. \nNow when Jack speaks it is more guarded and in even quieter tones. \nJACK This is the only recent shot we have of him... telescopic lens from half a mile away taken by the Israelis. Can you blame 'em for what happened? The only difference is the eyes. \nRamirez looks at the picture in shock at the resemblance. \nRAMIREZ Okay I get it now, you're here to talk me out of my lawsuit. But see I identified myself but they kept me in that cell for two more days chained to that wall after I told 'em who I was so... \nJACK Lieutenant Commander, I am not here about your lawsuit. Carlos is the single most vicious terrorist in the world. He's personally carried out or masterminded the worst terrorist attacks in modern history. Men, women, children. Children like yours... blown to bits or slaughtered in cold blood. Annibal... why did you join the Navy? \nRAMIREZ (as if by rote) To serve my country. \nJACK To serve your country... to protect her from her enemies. Well Carlos is one of her enemies now. And he'll probably become a bigger one... terrorism... unfortunately is a growth industry. \nRAMIREZ Why are you telling me all this? \nJACK Lieutenant Commander, the governments of most countries in the free world have been after Carlos for ten years and we have nothing to show for it. There is exactly one person in the world who can help us get Carlos. And that person is you. \nRAMIREZ What do you mean... to get him? \nJACK All I can tell you is it may take as much as six months to a year of preparation. It will involve a high degree of risk. That much said, you may never as much as lay eyes on him yourself. But if we succeed Carlos won't be a threat to anyone anymore. Now I know you're going to need some time to think about it so... \nRAMIREZ No I don't need any time. The answer's no. \nJACK Annibal... \nRAMIREZ Lieutenant Commander... I am a Naval Officer... that's what I was trained for... that's what I'm good at... See you came to the wrong address. You want James Bond. He lives in London and he's got an Aston Martin. You can't miss him. \nWe HOLD on Ramirez's look and Jack's half-smile. \nINT. OFFICERS' CLUB - NAVAL BASE - NORFOLK - EVENING \nThe Officers' Club is decked out for a reception for ADMIRAL CRAWFORD. All the officers are in dress whites and all the wives wear white gloves and cocktail dresses as a Navy string quartet plays softly in b.g. There is a reception line and the Admiral stands with his aide who introduces each of the guests who pass through the line. \nNAVAL AIDE Admiral Crawford this is Commander and Mrs. Ward Scowcroft. \nCRAWFORD I know your family well, Commander, I was with your father at the Academy. I expect great things from you Ward... great things. \nSCOWCROFT I won't let you down sir. \nNext up are Ramirez and his wife Maura. \nNAVAL AIDE Admiral Crawford this is Lieutenant Commander and Mrs. Annibal Ramirez. \nCRAWFORD Annabelle?! \nRAMIREZ (smiling) It's Annibal sir. \nCRAWFORD Yes... of course... well ... I'm glad to see we're getting some Mexican American officers in the ranks. I'm an L.A. boy myself so I have a real soft spot for authentic Mexican food... My stomach doesn't always go along with it but... \nMAURA We'd love to have you over to dinner Admiral but the cuisine would be Cuban not Mexican. I think your stomach would find it more agreeable... not to mention your taste buds. \nCRAWFORD You're Cuban Americans... oh I'm sorry... you grow up in L.A. and you hear Ramirez and... anyway it was a pleasure meeting you. \n", "random": "OV.

DuFraisne! \nRamirez whirls and misses and is hit by the trainer. Jack shakes his head and continues. \nJACK The guy's such a fanatic he names his three sons after Lenin. And I don't mean John. The same thing is true for Carlos. He's a guerilla fighter who loves champagne and caviar... LaPierre! \nRamirez whirls and hits the trainer in his shoulder at the same time that he himself is hit. Jack's look betrays no emotion. \nJACK He doesn't want to be Che Guevara, he wants to be the James Bond of the People's Liberation Front. It's not so much radical chic as an excuse for sadism. Paquet! \nAs he says this last, Ramirez whirls and shoots another trainer, dead in the chest. Ramirez smiles. He is beginning to enjoy playing terrorist. \nEXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY \nWe are speeding down the road in a suped-up open Jeep POV Ramirez, who is driving. Suddenly, we SEE Jack and Amos up ahead. Amos pulls a lever and a barrier snaps up at chest level across the road. We jam on the brakes and \nCUT TO: \nINT. JEEP - DAY \nRamirez is at the wheel. Suddenly he sees the barrier plate a hundred yards in front. He hits the brakes and the emergency brake at the same time. \nNEW ANGLE \nThe tires scream and leave black tracks, as the Jeep slides sideways towards the barrier. Just before reaching it, the car completes a 180-degree turn and roars back, but at the last second fishtails and swerves off the road. \nANGLE ON - RAMIREZ \nHe is obviously frustrated. \nANGLE ON - JACK \nHe shakes his head in disgust. \nJACK Dead again. \nEXT. BELVEDERE - DAY \nRamirez and Jack walk together on the belvedere which is an observation area with a railing around it, overlooking the abandoned prison. In between the belvedere and the prison is a field which is almost completely barren except for one tree. It sits down below. \nIn the distance, we SEE a snow mobile approach with its lights on. Just then, Jack takes a pocket sized remote transmitter and slips it into the front pocket of Ramirez's jacket, turning it on as he does. \nRAMIREZ What's that? \nJACK It's a transmitter. \nRAMIREZ For what? \nJACK Target practice. You're the target. \nJack quickly moves away from Ramirez. As Ramirez moves, he notices that the snow mobile changes direction as well, and continues to home in on him. And then there is a second snow mobile. And then a third, all of them coming straight for him. He starts to run. The snow mobiles turn and continue bearing down on him, driving him closer toward the railing. We SEE the snow mobiles are controlled by radio antennas, evidently homing in on his transmitter. \nJack, who has moved quite a ways off, pulls out a Beretta and sets it on the rail. We SEE on the snow mobiles, a lit- up remote device. \nJACK If you shoot out the receivers, they'll stop. There are ten rounds in this clip. The first two are live, the next three dummy, then three live, two dummy. \nRamirez stands like a deer in the headlights for an instant and then goes running for the gun. He cannot make it to the gun before the first snow mobile barrels down upon him. He is right against the rail now and goes diving into the snow. The snow mobile goes directly over him and crashes through the rail, falling down to the field below. Ramirez is up and running, grabs the gun, fires two rounds and misses, then hits three dummy rounds which click away as the second snow mobile draws closer. Then he fires and hits a headlight, then fires and misses, then fires and hits the remote device. That snow mobile stops in its tracks. The third now barrels down on Ramirez. He clicks off two dummy rounds and just before the snow mobile hits him, a shot rings out. The receiver shatters and we SEE Jack standing with the smoking gun with which he has just saved Ramirez's life. \nJACK Three times dead. \nINT. CAFETERIA - ABANDONED PRISON - DAY \nIt is after lunch and Jack and Amos are eating ice cream sundaes while Ramirez sits eating the last bit of porridge from the huge bowl. \nAMOS You finish all your porridge? \nRAMIREZ (deadly) Yeah... yeah... I finished all my porridge. \nAMOS Good now you can have some more. \nHe motions for the waiter who crosses with a fresh pot and starts to ladle it out into Ramirez's bowl. Ramirez reaches up and tears at his tie and rips open the top button. Ramirez explodes batting the waiter's hand away and sending the bowl flying. \nRAMIREZ Enough of this porridge shit man, hi jo deputa! Fuck it man... I ain't eatin' no more of this shit! And I ain't wearin' this fuckin' shirt anymore either! \nWith that he rips off the tie and rips open the shirt. \nAMOS Why Miguel amigo, whatever is the matter? \nRAMIREZ I'll tell you what the matter is man... I been here twelve mother fuckin' weeks an' all I've had to eat the whole time is this shit! And those dumb ass basketball games... what's that?!

She raises it, takes a long gulp, some of the fluid dripping down the corner or her mouth. She doesn't bother to wipe it away. It is there next to tearstains on her cheeks. Slowly, her rocking back and forth, her primal comforting, the act of an abused and abandoned child will turn into strokes, caresses of a secret style from a phantom lover who will get her in the mood for what she must do.

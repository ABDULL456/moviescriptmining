Soon after, Austin Powers volunteered to have himself frozen, in the event Dr. Evil should ever return.  We believe Dr. Evil has begun yet another plot to take over the world.  And that, gentlemen, is why we're here. \nCOMMAND GILMOUR Outstanding re-cap, Exposition. \nCommand Gilmour opens a vault door.  COLD MIST escapes. \nINT.  M.O.D. - CRYOGENIC STORAGE FACILITY \nThey pass a row of cryogenic holding berths, each containing a naked PERSON in suspended animation, a la Demolition Man. They pass GARY COLEMAN, EVEL KNIEVAL (with cape), and VANILLA ICE, all in suspended animation.  They pass a now-empty berth with a plate that reads \"JOHN \nTRAVOLTA.\" \nBORSCHEVSKY Who is this Austin Powers?  Is he a British operative? \nBASIL EXPOSITION No, he worked freelance, an internationally renowned swinging photographer by day and the ultimate gentlemen spy by night. \nFinally, they come across Austin Powers: He is naked.  His hands cover up his private parts.  The look on his face suggests 'Oh my God, my bits and pieces are cold'.  His glasses are frosted over.  He is very hairy. \nFEMALE ANNOUNCER (on PA) Attention, Stage One, laser cutting beginning. \nLasers begin to cut Austin out of the ice in one huge cube. \nFEMALE ANNOUNCER (on PA) Laser cutting complete.

This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence. \nThere's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil.  Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying.  That's the first place you should look.

EVIL (face again unseen) Ladies and Gentlemen, it's been a long time, but I'm back.  It's all gone perfectly to plan except for one small flaw.  Because of a technical error, my right arm was not frozen.  I was therefore by definition only partially frozen. \nANGLE ON EVIL ASSOCIATE MUSTAFA.  He is terrified and sweaty, eyes darting left and right. \nMUSTAFA But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left. \nDR.

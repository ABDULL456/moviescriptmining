It's as if, benumbed by the verdict, he seeks human contact. The only contact available, ironically, is with the officers of the court that just convicted him. \nEXT. 79TH STREET, CHICAGO, 1968 - ALI - DUSK \nTime has passed. It's winter. Snow's on the ground.

She's not quite eighteen, six feet tall; there's a supremely confident expressiveness about her. Her gestures are large. He opens his hand. The scarf is gone. She instinctively looks over at his other hand. Nothing's there. His eyes go wide in mock fright at the mysterious. \nALI (CONT'D) This spooky! Don't get scared... \nShe laughs. How'd he do it? He makes a fist again, puts his thumb in the hollow. And slowly pulls the scarf out... \nBELINDA (laughs) See, you don't need to fight no more... \nHe gives it to Belinda. She ties it around her neck. Ali looks at her. On a cold and dark afternoon, the windows are steamed and the bakery seems a fine refuge. \nALI So what's fresh, girl? \nBELINDA (smiles) Everything fresh! \nALI (smiles) What's the freshest of the freshest? \nBELINDA (smiles) Doughnuts just came out... \nALI (holds up the doughnut) Feed me those things, I gotta come back as a wrassler.

Wha's your name? \nShe slaps his arm. \nBELINDA You know my name! You came to my school, right before you win the title. Interviewed you for the school paper.

There is mature, deep-seated, dead-serious molten anger. Everybody in the room feels it. \nINT. CORRIDOR \nWith Bundini, Bingham, Rudy and Sarria as a wedge, Ali drives through reporters on the way to Belinda. Press mob Ali... \nPRESS Were you robbed? \nALI I lost. You lose, you don't shoot yourself. The world goes on. \nANOTHER REPORTER Joe said he didn't think you wanted to fight him again... \nALI (stops) Oh, how wrong he is. \nINT.

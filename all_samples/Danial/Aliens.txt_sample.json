RIPLEY'S APARTMENT - GATEWAY - DAY                  20 \nSilence.  Ripley, looking haggard, sits at a table in the dining alcove contemplating the smoke rising from her cigarette.  The place is modest, to be charitable, and there are few personal touches.  Though it's late in the day Ripley is still wearing a robe.  The bed is unmade.  Dishes in the sink.  Jones prowls across the counter.  The WALLSCREEN is on, blaring vapidly. \nVOICE FROM VIDEO (o.s.) Hey, Bob!  I heard you and the family are heading off for the colonies! \nBON (o.s.)

Young and severe in his officer's dress-black.  The door opens slightly. \nBURKE Hi, Ripley.  This is Lieutenant Gorman of the... \nSLAM.  Burke buzzes again.  Talks to the door... \nBURKE Ripley we have to talk. (pause) They've lost contact with the colony on Acheron. \nThe door opens.  Ripley considers the ramifications of that.  She motions them inside. \nINT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER                 22 \nBurke and Gorman are seated, nursing coffee.  Ripley paces, very tense. \nRIPLEY No.  There's no way! \nBURKE Hear me out... \nRIPLEY I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it. \nWe SEE that she's gut scared, covering it with anger. Burke sees it. \nBURKE Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all. \nGORMAN You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety. \nBURKE These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant? \nGORMAN (cool) We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations. \nRIPLEY (to Burke) What about you?  What's your interest in this? \nBURKE Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.' \nBurke is revealing his early days in sales. \nRIPLEY Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial. \nBURKE I heard you were working in the cargo docks. \nRIPLEY (defensive) That's right. \nBURKE Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing? \nRIPLEY (shrugging) It's all I could get.

She tries again. \nREVERSE ANGLE  from the med lab side, showing her futile efforts, the chair hitting with a dull THWACK barely audible through the double thickness pressure port. \nRipley turns, studying the room.  She fumbles through a clutter of equipment on a counter next to her and finds a SMALL EXAMINATION LIGHT.  Snapping it on she plays the beam over the walls.  Tall assemblies of surgical and anaethesiology equipment loom in the dark.  She hears, ot thinks she hears, movements.  The light spins across the room, swiveling and bobbing frantically.  Like an indicator of her growing panic. Newt starts a thin, high wailing. \nNEWT Mommy...mommmyyyyy... \nRipley steadies herself, realizing Newt's terror and the child's dependence on her.  She plays the beam across the ceiling.  Holds on something.  Gets an idea. She removes her lighter from a jacket pocket and picks up some papers from the counter.  Moving cautiously she boosts Newt up onto the SURGICAL TABLE in the center of the room and clambers up after her. \nNEWT Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared. \nRIPLEY I know, honey.  Me too. \nRipley lights the papers and holds the flaming mass under the temperature sensor of a fire control system SPRINKLER HEAD.  It triggers, spraying the room from several sources with water.  An ALARM sounds throughout the complex. \nINT.

He bolts for the door, yelling into his headset as he moves. \nHICKS Vasquez, Hudson, meet me in medical!  We got a fire! \nINT. OPERATING ROOM                                     145 \nRipley and Newt are drenched as the sprinklers continue to drizzle in the darkness.  The SIREN hoots maniacally, masking all other sound.  Ripley scans the room with her light, her hair plastered to her face, wiping water out of her eyes.  She is eye level with a complex surgical MULTILIGHT.  She looks into its tangle of arms and cables, inches away. Looks away.  Her eyes snap back.  SOMETHING LEAPS AT HER FACE.  She SCREAMS and topples off the table, splashing to the floor.  Newt shrieks and scrambles away as Ripley hurls the CHITTERING creature off of her.  It slams against a wall of cabinets, clings for a moment, then leaps back as if driven by a steel spring.  Ripley scrambles desperately, pulling equipment over on top of herself, clawing across the floor in a frenzy of motion.  In a blurr of multijointed legs the creature scuttles up her body. \nShe tears at it, but it is incredibly powerful for its size.  It moves like lightning toward her head, avoiding her fumbling hands.  Newt screams abjectly, backing away, until she is pressed up against a desk in one corner. \nRipley has both hands up, forcing the pulsing body back from her face.  The thing's tail whips around her throat and begins to tighten, forcing the underside of its body close to her.  Ripley thrashes about, knocking over equipment, sending instruments CLATTERING. Water streams over her, into her eyes, blinding her and making it impossible to get a grip on the creature's body. \nANGLE ON NEWT  as crablike legs appear from behind the desk, right behind her.  She sees it and, thinking fast, jams the desk against the wall, pinning the writhing thing.  The desk jumps and shudders against all the pressure her tiny body can bring to bear on it. She wails between gritted teeth as the second creature gets one leg free, then another and another.  Squeezing itself inexorably onto the desk top...toward her. \nThe legs of the chittering thing claw at Ripley's head, getting a surer grip even as she whips her head from side to side.  The obscene TUBULE extrudes wetly from the sheath on the creature's underside, forcing itself between the arms she has crossed tightly over her face. \nA figure appears at the observation window, a silhouette behind the misted-over glass.  A hand wipes a clear spot. Hick's eyes appear.  He steps back.  WHAM!  A burst of pulse-rifle fire shatters the tempered glass.  Hicks dives into the crazed spider web pattern and explodes into the room in a shower of fragments.  He hits rolling, his armor grinding through the shards, and slides across to Ripley.  He gets his fingers around the thrashing legs of the vicious beast and pulls.  Between the two of them they force is away from her face, though Ripley is losing strength as the tail tightens sickeningly around her throat.  Hudson leaps into the room, flings Newt away from the desk to go skidding across the wet floor, and blasts the second creature against the wall.  Point-blank.  Acid and smoke. \nGorman appears at Ripley's side and grabs the tail, unwinding its writhing length like a boa constrictor coil from her throat.  All of them grip the struggling, SHRIEKING creature. \nHICKS The corner!  Ready? \nHUDSON Do it! \nHicks hurls the thing into the corner.  It scrabbles upright in an instant and leaps back toward them. WHAM!  Hudson gets it clean. \nRipley collapses, gagging.  The alarm and sprinklers shut off automatically.  Hicks sees the stasis cylinders. \nRIPLEY (coughing) Burke...it was Burke. \nINT. OPERATIONS - ANGLE ON HUDSON                       146 \nlooking decidedly stressed-out.  He grips his rifle tightly, AIMED RIGHT AT CAMERA. \nHUDSON (intense) I say we grease this rat-fuck son of a bitch right now! \nTHE GROUP is gathered around Burke who sits in a chair, maintaining an icy calm although beads of sweat betray intense concealed tension.  Only a few minutes have passes and everyone is still buzzed on adrenaline, as if the whole group is charged with high voltage. \nHICKS (pacing) I don't get it.  It doesn't make any Goddamn sense. \nRipley stands in front of Burke, every fiber of her being accusing him with absolute outrage.  Burke tries to break Ripley's stare, which is like a diamond drill.  He can't. \nRIPLEY He wanted an alien, only he couldn't get it back through quarantine.  But if we were impregnated ...whatever you call it...and then frozen for the trip back at just the right time...then nobody would know about the embryos we were carrying. We and Newt. \nRipley glances at the little girl, a frail figure sitting nearby, hugging her knees and watching the proceedings with somber eyes.  She is all but lost in an adult jacket someone has found for her, and her still damp hair is plastered to her forehead and cheeks. \nHICKS Wait a minute.  We'd know about it. \nRIPLEY The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked. \nHUDSON Fuuuck!  He's dead. (to Burke) You're dogmeat, pal. \nBURKE This is total paranoid delusion. It's pitiful. \nRIPLEY (wearily) You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.

The heat grows more intense.  Pipes glowing cherry-red pass by.  Steam hisses and billows. The lift clatters in a steady beat.  Hypnotic. \nRipley removes her jacket and dons a battle harness directly over her T-shirt.  Her hair is matted, and she glistens with sweat.  Her eyes burn with a determination that holds the gut-panic in check. \nThe elevator descends.  She checks her weapon.  Attaches a BANDOLIER OF GRENADES to her harness.  Primes the flamethrower.  Checks the rifle's magazine.  Racks the bolt, chambering the first round.  She checks the MARKING FLARES jammed in the thigh pockets of her jump pants.  She drops an unprimed grenade, trembling, forcing herself to be strong.  We SEE she doesn't know doodley about grenades. \nThis is the most terrifying thing she has ever done.  She begins to hyperventilate, soaking with sweat.  Her fingers slick and slippery on the rifle.  The elevator descends. \nThe lift motors whine, slowing.  It hits bottom with a bump.  The safety cage retracts.  Slowly, expectantly, the doors open. \nHER P.O.V.  THROUGH the parting doors...an empty corridor.  Dark, swirling with steam, a ruddy glow VISIBLE here and there.

Behind her we SEE a SECOND ELEVATOR next to hers, its lift cage somewhere on a higher floor.  Ahead the corridor is encrusted with the alien excressence and not far down the bio-mechanoid catacomb begins. She enters the maze, darting glances at Hick's LOCATOR, taped to the top of her kludge weapon. \nA VOICE echoes down the tunnels, calm and mechanical. \nVOICE Attention.  Emergency.  All personnel must evacuate immediately.  You now have fourteen minutes to reach minimum safe distance. \nINT.

She approaches an intersecting tunnel.  Flashing emergency lights illuminate the insane fresco of the walls.  She spins, firing the flamethrower.  Nothing there.  She whirls back.  Moves forward, trembling and adrenalized. \nSkeletal figures drown in the walls, frozen in macabre tormented positions like human insects in amber. Steam blasts, blinding her.  The locator signal strengthens an she turns, crouches through a low passage, turns again.  At each intersection she quickly lights a FIFTEEN-MINUTE MARKING FLARE and drops it. For the way back.  She has to turn sideways, inching through a fissure between two walls of death...cocoon niches, human bas-relief sealed in resin. \nSUDDENLY SOMETHING SHOOTS OUT, GRABBING HER!  A hand. She recovers , then recognizes the face sealed in the wall.  Carter Burke. \nBURKE Ripley...help me.  I can feel it...inside.  Oh, God...it's moving!  Oh gooood... \nShe looks at him.  No one deserves this. \nRIPLEY Here. \nShe hands him a grenade, wrapping his fingers around the spoon, and pulls the primer.  She moves on. \nVOICE You now have eleven minutes to reach minimum safe distance. \nRipley moves ahead.  The locator signals shows she is almost there.  A CONCUSSION rocks the place, like an earthquake, jarring her almost off her feet.  Then another.  The whole station seems to shudder.  A SIREN begins to wail a demented rhythm.  Following the tracker she turns a corner and stops.  The RANGE INDICATOR READS ZERO.  She looks down, horrified to see Newt's tracer bracelet lying on the floor of the tunnel.  All hope recedes, disintegrating into mindless chaos. \nINT.

Her eyelids flutter open and she becomes aware of her surroundings.  The egg nearest her begins to move...opening like an obscene flower at its top to reveal something stirring within.  Newt stares, transfixed by terror, as the jointed legs appear over the lip of the ovoid one by one.  She SCREAMS. \nINT.

EGG CHAMBER                                        175 \nNewt watches the face-hugger emerge and turn toward her.  Ripley runs in just as it is tensing to leap, and FIRES, blasting it with a burst from the assault rifle.  The flash illuminates the figure of an adult warrior, nearby.  It spins, moving straight for Ripley.  Firing from the hip she drills it with two controlled bursts which catapult it back.  She steps toward it, FIRING AGAIN.  Her expression is murderous.  AND AGAIN.  It spins onto its back. She unleashes the flamethrower and it vanishes in a fireball.  Ripley runs to Newt and begins tearing at the fresh resinous cocoon material, freeing the child.  She swings her up onto her back. \nNEWT (weakly) I knew you'd come. \nRIPLEY Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight. \nGroggily Newt hooks her arms and legs through the belts of Ripley's battle harness as Ripley picks up her weapon.  More warriors are moving toward her among the eggs.  She fires the flamethrower.  The eggs are engulfed.  One of the warriors lunges forward, a living fireball.  She blasts it in half with two bursts from the M-41A.  Ripley retreats, ducking under a glistening cylindrical mass.  A PIERCING SHRIEK fill the chamber.  She turns.  And there it is. \nA massive silhouette in the mist, the ALIEN QUEEN glowers over her eggs like a great, glistening black insect-Buddha.  What's bigger and meaner than the Alien?  His momma.  Her fanged head is an unimaginable horror.  Her six limbs, the four arms and two powerful legs, are folded grotesquely over her distended abdomen.  The egg-filled abdomen swells and swells into a great pulsing tubular sac, suspended from a lattice of pipes and conduits by a weblike membrane as if some vast coil of intestine were draped carelessly among the machinery.  Ripley realizes she ducked under part of it a moment before.  Inside the abdominal sac can be SEEN the forms of countless eggs, churning their way toward the pulsating ovipositor where they emerge glistening, to be picked up by DRONES.  The drones are tiny scuttling albino versions of the \"warrior\" aliens we have already seen. \nRipley pumps the slide on her grenade launcher.  She fires.  Pumps and fires again.  Four times.  The grenades punch deep into the egg sac and EXPLODE, ripping it open from within.  Eggs are tons of gelatinous matter pour across the chamber floor.  The Queen goes berserk, SCREECHING like some psychotic steam whistle. Ripley lays about her with the flamethrower, igniting everything in sight with an insane fury.  Eggs shrivel in the inferno, and figures of warriors and drones vanish in frenzied thrashing.  Over all is the Queen's shrieking as she struggles in the flames.  Two warriors emerge from the boiling smoke, closing on her.  She pulls the trigger...an empty click.  DIGITAL COUNTER flashing crimson zeroes.  She drops the magazine, grabs another from her belt, rams it home and OPENS UP. \nThe creatures vanish in rapid-fire flashes.  Ripley backs away, venting her terror in a sustained orgy of fire as she blasts everything that moves in one long eye-searing expenditure of energy.  Then she dashes into the catacombs, navigating by sheer primal instinct. \nINT.

Impressions crash upon her...the maze blurring by, sirens howling, the station rocking with explosions, emergency lights flashing, steam blasting, red-hot steel hissing.  Reality itself is reduced to a concussive series of strobelike instants of relentless forward motion. \nShe sees one of the flares she dropped and turns. Sees another, sprinting toward it as the foundations of the world shake. \nINT. EGG CHAMBER                                        177 \n", "random": " Ripley takes a step.

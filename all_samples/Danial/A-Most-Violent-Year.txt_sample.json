", "truth": "ANNA leads the boys to the table, and we see a whole new side to her. She is going to get this done. As they approach the table we see two BANKERS stand to greet them. The Bank President, ARTHUR LEWIS, and Bank VP IAN THOMPSON. \nANNA Arthur. \nARTHUR LEWIS Anna, you look amazing as always. \nANNA Thank you. \nARTHUR LEWIS Gentlemen. Do you know Ian Thompson? One of our new VP's. \nANNA Ian. \nThey all shake hands and sit. The WAITER comes over. \nWAITER So what can I get you to drink? \nABEL A lot. \nAwkward laughter. \nABEL (CONT'D) A wine list please. \nWAITER I'll be right back. \nARTHUR LEWIS So how are you? ABEL We've been better... but we are good. \nARTHUR LEWIS Yes I heard about that... if you stay in business long enough it's bound to happen eventually. \nANNA Well that's exactly right. And we wanted to sit down with you tonight to make sure we were being totally up-front with everything that is going on and make sure that you understand the nature of the complaints and are comfortable that it is not going to affect our business in an adverse way. \nANDREW WALSH Did you have a chance to look over the outline that I sent over? \nARTHUR LEWIS Yes, we did. \nANNA Hopefully it made clear that even in a worst case situation we will pay off any and all fines and be able to move forward with very comfortable capital on hand. \nABEL jumps in taking some offense. \nABEL But you should know Arthur that this man has been digging through our industry for over two years looking for anything he can find. And as you know probably better than anyone, having worked with some of our competitors the thought that he would have singled us out is ridiculous. It reeks of everything that is wrong with this city right now. We run a fair and clean business and follow every standard industry practice and I will fight `til my last day to prove that... This silences the table for a long beat. \nABEL (CONT'D) But... but... \nABEL holds up his finger and points at ARTHUR across the table to make his point. \nABEL (CONT'D) ...Don't think for a moment that I am going to allow this mess to interfere with our plan to grow. We need to know you are standing by us. \nBANK VP IAN THOMPSON Yes, what is it with this piece of property that you find so integral or that can't be put off `til after this legal matter is dealt with? \nABEL is a little taken aback by this comment. It goes against everything that comes naturally to him as a person. ANNA and ANDREW know this and are concerned he might go off. \nABEL thinks it through. \nABEL That's a very good question. This property gives us many things... firstly direct access to the river. So I can bring in fuel directly from any provider in the world straight to my tanks, then it has over 10 million gallons of storage capacity, so I can buy in the summers when my price is low and sell to my customers and most importantly some of my competitors when the price is high. I won't just drive trucks anymore... I will control my fate... but the real answer to your question... \nNow ABEL stares right at IAN THOMPSON. \nABEL (CONT'D) ... is that when it feels scary to jump Ian... that is exactly when you must jump... or you risk ending up staying in the same place your whole life... and that I can't do. IAN THOMPSON awkwardly laughs a bit as ABEL just stays deadly serious staring right at him. Finally. \nARTHUR LEWIS We've always been there with you and know that we will continue to be. \nINT. ABEL'S CAR - NIGHT \nABEL is driving, and ANNA sits in silence looking out the passenger window. They are heading along the main backwoods road to their house. \nANNA Well, that went about as well as could be expected. \nABEL Yes. Arthur is a good man. \nANNA Do you think they will close? \nABEL Of course. \nJust as he says this a deer comes running out in front of them. ABEL tries to slam on the brakes but isn't able to stop in time. The car hits the deer and it careens over the windshield and on to the road behind the car. \nHe continues to slam on the brakes and comes to a complete stop. \nThey both catch their breath and look around to make sure they are both okay. Then they look back at the deer. It is laying on the road but is still breathing. \nABEL (CONT'D) Are you okay? \nANNA Yes... you need to go put it out of its misery. \n", "random": "\nEND OF ACT 2\n\nIN THE THIRD CHAPTER OF THE BOOK, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND THE MILITARY'S ARGUMENT RECOMMENDATION STRATEGY ACTIVITIES FOR THE OPERATION OF THE MARINE AND THE ARMY, THE LAUNCH OF COUNTERFACES AND SUPPORT FOR THE JUVENILE KILLERS, THE MAINTENANCE BUNKER AND THE UNITED STATES.<|endoftext|>The Seahawks have a lot of questions about", "sentiment": "-------------INA traces her away and onto the deck.

It makes me very sad, because he is a very talented young man. But there are some decisions that you cannot come back from. I need to know where he is. And I need him to turn himself in. His actions are hurting me and my business. And I refuse to let other people's weaknesses hurt me. I don't know how it has come to this, but it has. If he does the right thing I will help to take care of his responsibilities. You and your family. When you see him. Tell him this. Please. LUISA I will. ABEL gets up and starts looking around the apartment a bit. He walks over to a small cabinet. ABEL Does he have any money? ", "truth": "ABEL Money? Has he taken money out of your bank account? \nLUISA I don't know? \nABEL You need to start looking into these things. It is very important that we find him safely. \nAnd with that JULIAN comes smashing out of the tiny cabinet where he was hiding and knocks over ABEL. JULIAN runs to the front door with ABEL chasing him. \nHe starts flying down the stairs at top panic speed. ABEL follows him down half the flight and realizes it is useless. \nABEL (CONT'D) (IN ENGLISH) Stop! Stop running away! Andrew! He's coming your way! \nThis is screamed at the top of his lungs but JULIAN never stops. We just hear his footsteps going down. \nINT. BOTTOM/TOP OF JULIAN'S STAIRWELL - DAY \nANDREW comes up the first few steps and we see him waiting for JULIAN. \nABEL then looks back up the half flight of stairs and sees LUISA standing there in the hall. He walks back up to her in an aggressive way. We fear for her. He gets right up in her face but does not touch her. \nABEL (in Spanish again) I understand why you lied, but it is not smart. (MORE) \nABEL (CONT'D) There are other people looking for him. I am as good an option as he has. Know this. \nAnd with that he heads down the stairs. \nEXT. BACK OF JULIAN'S APARTMENT/PARK STAIRS - DAY \nJULIAN is running out the back of the building and down a huge exterior staircase that is in a small park. He is about half way down when ANDREW gets to the top. ANDREW screams. \nANDREW WALSH Fuck You! You better run! \nINT. A SLIGHTLY RUNDOWN CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nABEL sits across a table from an OLD MAN in his late-70's who seems to have early-onset dementia and a WOMAN in her early- 20's, LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ who's overweight, but confident. The old man, SAUL LEFKOWITZ, just sits there through the scene. \nABEL Thank you both for agreeing to meet with me. \nLORRAINE LEFKOWITZ Of course. \nABEL I think we have met before but I didn't realize you were Saul's Granddaughter. \nLORRAINE LEFKOWITZ I am. \nABEL I'm sorry to ask but how old are you? \nLORRAINE LEFKOWITZ I'm 23. \nABEL Oh. \nLORRAINE LEFKOWITZ My Grandfather didn't trust any of his children to run the business. \nABEL Yes. LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ I know that you tried to buy the company from my Grandfather several times. \nABEL Yes. LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ His goal was to stay healthy long enough to be able to give the company to me. Which he thankfully did. \nThey both give a slight smile. \nLORRAINE LEFKOWITZ (CONT'D) So, while I appreciate your visit we are still not for sale. \nABEL I understand. And I hope that your Grandfather was able to communicate to you how much I have always respected him. And it was only out of respect for the business he had built, and because I knew of his reservations and feelings about your uncles and your father that I made those offers. \nLORAINE LEFKOWITZ I understand. \nABEL But, I am not here to offer to buy your company. \nLORAINE LEFKOWITZ Oh. \nABEL As I'm sure you will soon learn some years are good... others not so. I am in contract with a significant hard deposit at risk to purchase the old Bayfront terminal. \nLORAINE LEFKOWITZ I see. \nABEL And due to circumstances beyond my control my bank has left me at the altar. \nLORAINE LEFKOWITZ I'm sorry. \nABEL So, I am here, hat in hand, looking for a loan. I certainly expect the terms to be in your favor as I could not be at a weaker place. But, if your Grandfather trusted you with his company, I would be willing to trust you as my lien holder. \nThey all stare at each other.

ABEL What does that mean? \nANNA It will help. You could replace Peter's money and get him out of the deal. ABEL Where did it come from? \nANNA Abel. \nABEL Where did it come from? \nShe stops and thinks, then: \nANNA Since 1971 I have been skimming money out of the company. Some years a little... others a lot. In the beginning it was just in case times got tough but then it was because you were taking all these chances... I didn't know what else to do... I couldn't risk having us be left with nothing. \nThis knocks him back. \nANNA (CONT'D) I'm sorry. \nABEL What do you expect me to do with this? \nANNA Use it.... Abel... \nABEL Is it clean? \nANNA What does that mean? \nHe thinks that through. \nABEL It means if you walked into the office of the people who have been trying to put us in jail right now and slapped a check from that account down on their desk would it push me further into hell or help to get me out? \nANNA It's as clean as every other dollar we've ever made. \nABEL That's a fucking bullshit answer. \nANNA I can clear it on the books. \nABEL Well it sounds like you should take this money and keep it right where it is... because I'm going to pretend that we never had this conversation. And you can use that when they drag me off to jail! With that he tries to get passed her and head upstairs. She follows and is standing looking up at him. \nANNA So what's your plan here? \nHe turns to her and squares off. \nABEL I'll get it done. And it won't be as a cheat. \nANNA (Yelling, but controlled enough to not wake the kids.) Oh you are too much. You've been walking around your whole life like this all happened because of your hard work, good luck, and charm. Mr. Fucking American Dream. Well this is America... but it's not a dream, and that wasn't good luck helping you out all those years... IT WAS ME! Doing the things you didn't want to know about... \nABEL You stole from me! This stops her in her tracks. And eventually a little smile comes across her face. She comes way down and almost delivers this line in a whisper. \nANNA Oh... You have always been very good about not letting your ego get in the way of business. Don't start now just because it's me. \nWith that ABEL turns up the stairs and heads to bed. \nINT. MASTER BATHROOM - MORNING \nABEL is getting ready for the day shaving. He looks exhausted. ANNA comes into the room. She stands at the entryway just looking at him for a very long beat. \nABEL We'll use the money... your money. It's the smart play. ANNA It's our money. \nABEL I know... \nFADE TO BLACK. \nBefore we see anything, we hear the sound of a pen writing on paper. \nINT.

TEMPORARY TRAILER - DAY \nABEL comes out and we see ANNA standing outside the trailer in the cold because these guys don't do business with women. He hands her the document.

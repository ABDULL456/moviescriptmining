Anna goes to the window.   Draws back the curtains. \nBEATRICE You've forgotten haven't you? \nANNA No I haven't forgotten.   The service isn't till six. \nBEATRICE Then you've got plenty of time to wash it out. \nANNA It's permanent. You can't wash it out. \nBEATRICE Then dye it back. You can't show up at the funeral looking like that. Like some prostitute. \nANNA I don't look-- \nBEATRICE Don't argue with me. Why are you constantly arguing with me? Anna bites her tongue.    Heads to the door. \nBEATRICE Where are you going? \nANNA To do the washing up. \nBEATRICE The sheets need changing.    They haven't been changed in months. \nANNA I changed them Monday.

The Buick SCREECHES away, SWERVING around a CAR coming the other way. JACK What the hell, Wendell?! ", "truth": "(CHECKS MIRROR) Told us more men were coming. Maybe those boys. Mr. Rickey said to get you to Daytona Beach a-s-a-p. \nJACK Why didn't you say so? \nSMITH Mr. Rickey was afraid you wouldn't leave, that you would fight. As it becomes clear, Jack starts to LAUGH. \nSMITH What the hell are you laughing at? \nJACK I thought you woke me because I was cut from the team. Jack LAUGHS harder. Wendell LAUGHS as well. As it fades, Jack looks back over his shoulder. Jesus... \nCUT TO: \n44 EXT. CITY ISLAND BALLPARK - DAYTONA BEACH - DAY 44 \nA stadium SIGN boasts Brooklyn Dodgers vs. Montreal Royals. \nPINK REV 4-19-12 35. Daytona Beach's black community is turning out to see Jackie Robinson. Hundreds of people line up, mass at the: Colored Entrance. In their Sunday best. Families. Couples. The old. The frail. Young boys chase after each other. One MOTHER stands on her toes to spot her son. \nMOTHER Ed! You stay where I can see you! 13-year old ED CHARLES turns, waves his baseball glove over his head so she can see him. Then to no one in particular: \nED I'm thirteen years old. WHITE PEOPLE enter at several gates around them. \nCUT TO: \n45 CLOSE ON BRANCH RICKEY - THE DODGER DUGOUT 45 He sits watching as the segregated bleachers in right fill with BLACK FANS. All else is white. Rickey pops a PEANUT in his mouth, confides to someone alongside him we don't see. \nRICKEY I've spoken to the mayor. I've explained how much money we'll spend in Daytona. But still, when this fine young Negro man steps on that field today, he and the Dodgers will technically be breaking the law. A law which says white and black players cannot enjoy the same field at the same time. Does that make sense to you? Does Jim Crow make any sense when placed against the words of the United States Constitution? When placed against the word of God? POP OUT to reveal he sits beside the DODGER BATBOY, so short his feet don't touch the ground. Rickey offers his peanut bag. As the batboy takes one... \nRICKEY I'll tell you, it does not make sense to me. \nCUT TO: \n46 OMITTED 46 \nPINK REV 4-19-12 36. \n47 OMITTED 47 \n48 OMITTED 48 \n49 EXT. ON DECK CIRCLE - CITY ISLAND BALLPARK - DAY 49 \nJack swinging two bats to get loose. Watches as the Montreal BATTER hits a LINE DRIVE which -- Pee Wee Reese nearly leaps out of his socks to bring down. Wow... As the CROWD claps in appreciation, Jack takes a deep breath. \nPA ANNOUNCER Now batting the second baseman -- Jackie Robinson! Jack wincing as he steps forward to both cheers and boos from the white sections. As a \u00e2\u0080\u0098go home, coon' drifts over -- A BIG OVATION from the black section in right drowns it out. \nCOLORED SECTION - RIGHT FIELD Rachel sits with Smith. They react to some of the INVECTIVE coming from the white section. \nRACHEL Jack's got a thick skin. He'll be okay. \nSMITH How about you? \nRACHEL \n(SHRUGS) I better get one in a hurry. \nINFIELD Higbe watching from the mound as Jack steps into the batter's box. Two well wishing voices from the infield stands. \nSPECTATOR ONE Come on, black boy, you can make the grade! \nSPECTATOR TWO They're giving you a chance! Do something about it! Jack heartened at the words. Concentrates as Higbe's first pitch is fired. High and tight, Jack jerks out of the way. \nYELLOW REV 4-24-12 37. Bragan, behind the plate, chucks the ball back, grins up at Jack who does not look down at him as he settles back in. \nED CHARLES The 13-year-old holding his hands together in prayer. \nED Please, God, let Jackie show them what we can do. \nHOME PLATE Here comes the next pitch. Even tighter. Jack nearly hit. \nUMPIRE Ball two! Jack glaring, crowds the plate more. Bragan shows 1, taps his right thigh signalling outside. Jack watches it sail, doesn't bite. The umpire: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBall Three!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Higbe's fun slipping away as he can't find the strike zone. \nHIGBE Come on, Rook! Ain't you gonna swing at something?! Jack takes a practice swing, waits as Bragan sets up right over the plate. Here comes the pitch. Low. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBall four!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nRACHEL & SMITH A big, over-reacting CHEER from the Colored section. \nSMITH It's just a walk. \nRACHEL Who can blame them? \nHIGBE Looks ill-tempered over to first where Jack gives the same look back as he sidesteps an enormous, defiant lead off the bag. Higbe incredulous. Did he just do that? \nDUROCHER \n(FROM DUGOUT) Well throw over there for crying out loud! Higbe fires to LAVAGETTO at first. Jack dives back in time. \nYELLOW REV 4-24-12 38. Higbe gets the ball back, settles. Jack takes a lead, but a modest one this time. Here come the pitch -- And Jack goes. You knew he was fast; but not this fast. Bragan's throw to Pee Wee is late and high. Pee Wee throws back to Higbe. Higbe sets. Bragan gives him a sign. Jack takes a lead. On the wind-up, Jack goes. Bragan stands -- it's a PITCH OUT. Bragan fires to third and Jack is caught in a RUN DOWN. It seems like half the team gets involved with Higbe finally getting the ball by third and Jack ducking under the tag. Safe! A BUZZ goes through the stadium now as people start to realize they are not watching something or someone ordinary. \n", "random": "(a/N)The Buick. You know the Buick. It's a damn good bike.

Smith leans back, blinks. \nSMITH That's right. Me again. Something wrong with that, Jack? \nJACK Come on. Jack continues past. As Smith follows... \nCUT TO: \n92 INT.

More silence, then... \nSMITH You ever wonder why I sit out in right field with my typewriter on my knees? Does that ever cross your mind? Jack stares out the passenger window, not in the mood. As he looks up at some of the taller buildings they pass... \nSMITH It's because Negro reporters aren't allowed in the press box. Jack doesn't answer, doesn't look over. Finally Smith starts talking to himself. Pretending to be Jack. \nGOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 62. \nSMITH \u00e2\u0080\u0098AS JACK' You know, Wendell, I never asked you where you were from? \nSMITH Why I'm from Detroit, Jack. \nSMITH \u00e2\u0080\u0098AS JACK' You don't say?

My daddy was Mr. Henry Ford's cook. \nSMITH \u00e2\u0080\u0098AS JACK' I did not know that. \nSMITH Cooked for him for years, but never once broke bread with him. I'd go to work with daddy sometimes. Play baseball out on the lawn with Mr. Ford's grandchildren. We all had a real good time. But it was understood, if they got tired of playing ball and moved inside to the bowling alley or swimming pool, I was not invited or allowed. The grass was as far as I got. So guess what? You're not the only one with something at stake here. \nJACK (after a beat) If I start talking, will you stop? \nSMITH I'd be happy to. Smith stops at a red light. \nJACK I apologize. You've been there for me through this more than anyone besides Rae and Mr. Rickey. But I guess that's what bothers me. \nSMITH How do you mean? \nJACK I don't like needing someone to be there for me. I don't like needing anyone but myself. I never have. \nGOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 63. \nSMITH You are a hard case, Jack Robinson. Is it okay if I keep driving you or should I let you out so you can walk? Jack bursts out laughing. So does Smith. \nJACK You remember the last time we were at a red light? Down in Florida? \nSMITH New York City now, baby.

[{"id": 2550, "prefix": "CUT TO: INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY Tom, starting to get that unshaven, unkempt look, wanders through the self-help section. He leafs through some of the titles. He grabs just about every one of them. ", "truth": "Tom has more than fifty self-help books on a shelf by his bed. He reads from one called \"Six Steps to Getting Over Him.\" \nTOM (V.O.) \"So he broke your heart. You've been sad and depressed for weeks. Perhaps you've turned to drinking or even drugs. And nothing's helped. Now what? Should you binge on rocky road and watch soaps all day?\" \nSECONDS LATER. Tom sits in his bed eating ice cream. He continues to read. \nTOM (V.O.) \"No you should not.\" \nHe slowly puts the ice cream down. \nTOM (V.O.) \"Through extensive research, we have found the six most effective ways to get over that lost love and make room in your heart for a new man to fill. Those steps are:\" \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nTom jogs. \nTOM (V.O.) \"One. Exercise. The body's release of endorphins will assuage the brain and provide a genuine sense of accomplishment and success.\" \nCars pass him at top speed. Bicycles breeze by him. A child on a big wheel soars past. He may as well be jogging in place. \nINT. YOGA CENTER - NIGHT \nTom is taking a yoga class. \nTOM (V.O.) \"Two. Physical and Mental relaxation. Channel all of your energies to the core of your being for a new understanding of the self and others.\" \nThis shit is really fucking hard when you're as inflexible as Tom. Everyone else in the class seems at peace. Tom can't even get the breathing right. \nINT. HOMELESS SHELTER - DAY \nTom feels good about himself as he gives out food to the homeless. \nTOM (V.O.) \"Three. Charity. Reach out! You are not alone in your pain.\" \nNext in line is a HOMELESS COUPLE holding hands. Tom spirits immediately fall. Even these two somehow found each other. \nINT SHOE STORE - DAY \nTom stands in the center of a fashionable ladies shoe store. \nTOM (V.O.) \"Four. Shoe Shopping! Ladies...you know you want to. Indulge!\" \nANGLE ON TOM, just sorta standing there. Confused. He doesn't really want new shoes. \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nTom backpacks alone in the forest. \nTOM (V.O.) \"Five. Travel. Take some time to see another environment. Get perspective. It's a beautiful world. It will be for you again someday.\" \nThis is it, he's finally found some peace. Tom looks up to the tops of the trees where the sunlight is peeking in and takes a deep breath. \nFREEZE ON TOM. \nINFORMATION BUBBLES pop up on the screen to point out that Tom is standing in POISON OAK. There's a RUSTY BEAR TRAP a step ahead of him. A giant POISONOUS SNAKE creeping up behind him. A TICK on his leg. And in the distance a HUNTER has Tom sized up in his rifle sight. \nUNFREEZE. \nTom starts to itch... \nINT. APARTMENT - LATER \nTom is painting the walls of his now nearly bare apartment. \nTOM (V.O.) \"Six. Redecorate. Start anew.\" \nHe's focused on his task and in fact seems pretty good at it. \nTOM (V.O.) \"By taking these few steps, you will have discovered your inner strength and should be ready to move on. I bet you can hardly remember his face at all.\" \nWe pull back to REVEAL Tom has painted a giant mural of Summer on his wall. He looks at the self-help book and dropkicks it. \nINT CROWDED BAR - NIGHT \nSummer and Tom stand by the bar. \nTOM I just don't get women's fashion nowadays. Everybody with the tattoos, the giant hoop earrings, those annoying hats. Explain this to me. \nSUMMER People think it looks good. \nTOM Do you? \n", "random": "\u00a0He's in the middle of a little war. \u00a0He has a couple of years to get back to the way he was. \u00a0He has to figure out why he's here. \u00a0He has to figure out why he's here. \u00a0He has to figure out why he's here. \u00a0He has to figure out why he's here. \u00a0He has to figure out why he's here. \u00a0He has to figure out why he's here.", "sentiment": "\u00a0It's a large book. \u00a0He gets ready to go. \u00a0The teens are all too happy. \u00a0They know they're getting a chance at a life. \u00a0They pull away from the crowd. \u00a0The TV is also there. \u00a0Sitting in a large and square corner, is Cindy. \u00a0There is a fireplace at the back. \u00a0The TV is in the front. \u00a0Sending messages of love and a life. \u00a0"}, {"id": 2551, "prefix": "TOM No. Where's that coming from?

The best you could. I guess we can't expect to win 'em all. I want to tell you something I've kept to myself for years. I was in the war myself -- the Medical Corps. I was on duty late one night when a badly wounded pilot was brought in from a raid. He could barely talk, but he looked at me and he said, \"Doc. The odds were against us up there but we went in anyway, and I'm glad we did. The captain made the right decision.\" The pilot's name was George Zipp. \nStriker looks up.

He glances to a point above his listeners, and an overhead projector splashes a diagram of molecular structure (and the silhouette of a raised hand) onto a screen.

Sayer is there, quite alone, looking at him. NEUROCHEMIST Are you speaking to me? Sayer is. And really wants to know the answer. The chemist zips up and moves to the sinks to wash his hands. SAYER If jail the compulsions in the Parkinson's patient were somehow accelerated - (demonstrating what he means) - the hands, the shaking, the tics, the head bobbing, the quickening speech - (he's become a mass       \u00bb of tics and accelerated speech) - might they not cave in on themselves and, in effect, turn the person into stone?

{"test1_input": "High above, on a darkened balcony, a lone figure. Watching. \nMAYOR (O.S) Now I'm going to give way to an important voice... \nDown below at the bar, Commissioner Gordon examines some sheets of densely written paper. A Congressman muscles in. \nCONGRESSMAN Commissioner. \nGORDON Congressman. \nCONGRESSMAN Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of these things? Gordon shakes his head. Gordon's Deputy Commissioner, Foley, cuts in. \nFOLEY No one has. Not in years. \nMAYOR (O.S) He can tell you about the bad old days, when the criminals and corrupt ran this town with such a tight grasp that people put their faith in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape. A thug who showed his true nature when he betrayed the trust of this great man - (Turns to picture of Dent.) And murdered him in cold blood. The Congressman watches a tray of canap\u00e9s breeze past, then grabs the ass of the maid carrying them. She freezes. \nCONGRESSMAN Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow. \nMAID (turns, tight smile) Shrimp balls? The Congressman grabs two. The Maid moves off. The Congressman glances down at Gordon's papers. \nMAYOR (O.S) Jim Gordon can tell you the truth about Harvey Dent... \nCONGRESSMAN Jesus, Gordon, is that your speech? We're gonna be here all night. \nGORDON Maybe the truth about Harvey isn't so simple, Congressman. \nMAYOR (O.S) But I'll let him tell you himself - Commissioner Gordon? Applause. Gordon approaches the mike. Looks down at his long speech. Thinks. \nGORDON The truth...? INSERT CUT: Harvey Dent, face half destroyed, threatens Gordon's son with a handgun. \nGordon surveys the audience. Deciding. I have written a speech telling the truth about Harvey Dent... Gordon folds up his speech. Maybe the time isn't right... Gordon stuffs the papers inside his jacket. The Congressman mutters under his breath. \nCONGRESSMAN Thank Christ for that... \nGORDON Maybe right now all you need to know is that there are a thousand inmates in Blackgate Prison as a direct result of the Dent Act. These are violent criminals, essential cogs in the organized crime machine that terrorized Gotham for so long. Maybe, for now, all I should say about Harvey Dent's death is this...it has not been for nothing. The figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion. People clap as Gordon leaves the mike. Gordon approaches Foley. \nGORDON The second shift reports in? \nFOLEY On your desk. But you should put in some more time with the Mayor - \nGORDON That's your department. \nGordon heads for the line of town cars in the gravel drive. \nCONGRESSMAN Anyone shown him the crime stats? \nFOLEY He goes by his gut, and it continues to bother him, whatever the numbers. \nCONGRESSMAN Must be popular with the wife. \nFOLEY Not really. She took the kids and moved to Cleveland. \nCONGRESSMAN He'll have plenty of time for visits. Mayor's dumping him in the spring. \nFOLEY Really? He's a hero. \nCONGRESSMAN War hero. This is peacetime. Stay smart, the job's yours. \nINT. KITCHENS, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER \nOur Maid dives into the bustle of Wayne Manor below stairs - Caterers and Maids, Wait Staff. She overhears another Maid. \nMAID 2 They say he never leaves the East Wing. \nMAID 3 I heard he had an accident - that he's disfigured. \nThe other Maids signal her to be quiet. All the chatter has died. Alfred has entered the kitchen. \nALFRED Mr. Till, why are your people using the main stairs? Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered plate. Picks up the tray, looks around the chaotic kitchen. \nALFRED Where's Mrs. Bolton? \nMAID She's up at the bar, sir. Can I help? \nAlfred looks at the Maid. Hands her a key and the tray. \nALFRED The East drawing room. Unlock the door, place the tray on the table, lock the door again. Nothing more. \nThe Maid nods. Takes the tray. \nINT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER \nFollowing the Maid through the empty house. She comes to the large oak door to the East Wing. Unlocks it... \nINT. DRAWING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS \nThe room is dark, quiet. The Maid places the tray on the table. She looks at the inner door opposite. It is ajar... \nINT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS \nAlfred talks to an elegant woman, thirties, Miranda Tate. \nALFRED I'm sorry, Miss Tate, but I've tried. He won't see you. \nMIRANDA It's important, Mr. Pennyworth. Her accent is European. Hard to place. \nALFRED Mr. Wayne is as determined to ignore important things as trivial ones. \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) Don't take it personally, Miranda. \nThey turn to see a man in his fifties. Daggett. \nDAGGETT Everyone knows Wayne's holed up in there with eight-inch nails, peeing into Mason jars. (To Alfred.) Good of you to let me on the grounds. \nALFRED The Dent Act is about all Gotham. Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate, always a pleasure. Alfred turns and walks off. Daggett smiles, glib. \nDAGGETT Why waste your time talking to the man who threw away your investment on some save-the-world vanity project? He can't help you get your money back. But I can. \nMIRANDA I could try explaining that a save-the-world project, vain or not, is worth investing in, whatever the return. I could try, Mr. Daggett, but you understand only money and the power you think it buys, so why waste my time, indeed? \n", "test1_true": "INT. DRAWING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS \nClose on the dinner tray. We hear a labored step approach. Bruce Wayne appears, leaning on a cane. Gaunt. Grey temples. He lifts the lid of his dinner, then freezes, hearing something. He slowly limps into the next room... \nINT. SITTING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR, CONTINUOUS \nThe Maid looks at framed photographs of Rachel, Thomas and Martha Wayne. Some are half-burned. She notices an archery target, arrows stuck in it. She reaches out. WHAM! An arrow sticks into the target - the Maid spins around, flustered. Wayne, at the other end of the long room, lowers a composite bow. Picks up his cane. \nMAID I'm, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne. It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it? \nWayne nods, gently. Limps towards her. \nMAID Although you don't have the long nails... (Nervous laugh.) Or facial scars... She trails off, embarrassed. Coy. She seems very young. \nWAYNE Is that what they say about me? \nMAID It's just that...nobody sees you... \nWayne approaches slowly. He nods at her pearl necklace. \nWAYNE That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds me of the one that belonged to my mother. It can't be the same one - her pearls are in this safe - He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the bureau, revealing a safe door... - which the manufacturer clearly explained is uncrackable. \n...which swings open with an awkward creak. \nMAID Oops. No one told me it was uncrackable. \nThe Maid suddenly seems more confident. Older. \nWAYNE I'm afraid I can't let you take those. \nShe smiles at him. Moves towards him. \nMAID Look, you wouldn't hit a woman any more than I would beat up a cripple. She kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down. Of course, sometimes exceptions have to be made. \nThe Maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window. Goodnight, Mr. Wayne. She flips backwards through the window. Wayne smiles, then rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace. He looks at the safe, notices something. Powder... \nEXT. DRIVE, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS \nMoving toward the line of town cars, the Maid pulls off her white apron, cuffs and collar, leaving a black dress and pearls. A Valet hurries to open a car door for her - she slips into a town car...beside the Congressman. \nMAID Can I have a ride? The Congressman, a little tipsy, looks at her hungrily. \nCONGRESSMAN You read my mind. \nINT. EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - LATER \nAlfred enters, to find Wayne kneeling at the safe. \nALFRED Miss Tate was asking to see you again. \nWAYNE She's very persistent. \nALFRED And quite lovely, in case you were wondering. \nWAYNE I wasn't. \nALFRED What are you doing? \nWAYNE Examining print dust. We've been robbed. \nALFRED And this is your idea of raising the alarm? \nWAYNE \n(SHRUGS) She took the pearls. Tracking device and all. \nALFRED She? \nWAYNE One of the maids, perhaps you should stop letting them in this side of the house. \nALFRED Perhaps you should learn to make your own bed, then. Why are you dusting for prints? \nWAYNE I'm not. She was. \nEXT. ROOFTOP, MAJOR CRIMES UNIT - CONTINUOUS \nGordon brings a stack of files against the air duct, settles to read. Next to him is a rusty, broken searchlight. \nYOUNG VOICE (O.S.) Sir? \nA young Cop is standing there. This is Blake. \nBLAKE I didn't want to bother you up here, but they're looking for you. \nGORDON What's the problem, son? \nBLAKE Congressman Gilly's wife's been calling. He hasn't made it home from the Wayne Foundation event. \nGORDON That's a job for the police? \nBLAKE Sir, I've been a cop for a year and I've only logged half a dozen arrests. When you and Dent cleaned the streets you cleaned 'em good. Pretty soon we'll be chasing overdue library books. Gordon smiles at this. Blake looks at his stack of files. \nBLAKE But here you are. Like we're still at war... \nGORDON Old habits. \nBLAKE Or instinct. \nGORDON What's your name, son? \nBLAKE Blake, sir. \nGORDON You have something you want to ask me, Officer Blake? \nBLAKE It's that night. This night, eight years ago. The night Dent died. \nGORDON What about it? \n", "test1_id": 651, "test2_input": "FOX Where are you taking us? \nBANE Where you buried your resources. The bowels of Gotham. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nGordon, with a Nurse's help, pulls himself to a seated position as Blake watches. \nGORDON So you think our friend is gone again? \nBLAKE \n(GRAVE) This time...he might not be coming back. Gordon takes this in...Foley bursts in, agitated. \nFOLEY Okay, Commissioner, you were right. \nGORDON What's happened? \nFOLEY Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne Enterprises board. He let most of them go, but took three down into the sewers. \nGORDON No more patrols, no more hide and seek. Send every available cop down there to smoke him out. \nFOLEY The Mayor won't want panic - \nBLAKE So it's a training exercise. \nFoley looks at Gordon. \nFOLEY I'm sorry for not taking you \nSERIOUSLY - \nGORDON Don't apologize for believing the world's in better shape then it is...just fight to make it true. \nFoley nods. Leaves. Blake gets up. \nGORDON Not you. You're telling me the Batman's gone. So you chase up the Daggett leads, any way you can. \nBlake nods. \nINT. STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY \nWayne lies, weak, feverish. A Prisoner drips water onto his parched lips. An elderly Blind Prisoner squatting by the wall in the next cell rasps something in an ancient tongue. \nPRISONER He asks if you would pay us to let you die. I told him you have nothing. \nWAYNE Do it for the pleasure. \nThe Prisoner puts bread to Wayne's lips. \nPRISONER They pay me more than that to keep you alive. \nA chant gets Wayne's attention. He rolls his head painfully to watch a Tattooed Prisoner hand a thick rope to a Strong Man, who ties it around his chest, watched by other Prisoners. \nPRISONER He will try the climb. Strong Man starts scaling the wall. The Prisoners' chant grows stronger as he climbs towards the light. \nAbove: Strong Man stops, perched on a ledge, a twelve-foot leap from the rest of the climb... The chanting peaks as Strong Man leaps...misses...falls. The rope catches - he swings into the rock face. Prisoners fall silent as Strong Man is lowered, broken, bloody, to the prison floor. \nWAYNE Has anyone made it? \nPRISONER Of course not. \nThe Blind Prisoner barks at him. \nWAYNE What does he say? \nPRISONER He says there is one who did. A child... INSERT CUT: a child of about ten looks up towards the light. \nPRISONER A child who had been born in this hell... \nWAYNE Bane. \nPRISONER An old legend. Nothing more. The Prisoner leaves Wayne's cell - switches on the TV. \nWAYNE Don't. \nPRISONER Whatever they want you to see...it's happening soon. \nINT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - DAY \nBane's men lead Fox, Miranda and Fredericks through the debris. Fox stares at Mercenaries working on his old inventions... \nEXT. LOCATIONS AROUND GOTHAM - EVENING \nSWATs and Cops mass around entrances to sewers, tunnels... \nINT. MASSIVE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS \nBane leads Fox and the others to where Mercenaries plant charges on a hewn wall. Dr. Pavel is here. Waiting. Bane nods at his men. The wall blows. \nEXT. LOCATIONS AROUND GOTHAM - CONTINUOUS \nA SWAT team about to enter a sewer pipe hear a low echoing boom. They look at each other, then head in. Thousands of Police head into manholes, tunnel entrances, checking weapons, using flashlights... \nINT. MASSIVE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS \nBane leads the way over rubble into the REACTOR. Dr. Pavel follows. Bane approaches the machine. Turns to Fox. \nBANE Turn it on. \nFox shakes his head. Bane holds his gun to Fredericks' head. \nBANE I only need one other board member. There are eight more waiting upstairs. \nFOX I won't do it. Fredericks trembles. Bane cocks the weapon. \nMIRANDA Alright, stop. She walks up to the scanner. Places her hand on it. It beeps. She turns to Fox. Quietly pleading. \nMIRANDA Lucius, you'll kill this man and yourself, and barely slow them down. Fox reluctantly puts his hand on the scanner. Then Fredericks. The core glows brighter and brighter. Dr. Pavel is transfixed. \n", "test2_true": "EXT. GOTHAM STADIUM - DAY \nThe Mayor, flanked by Security, talks to a crowd of Reporters. \nREPORTER We're seeing literally thousands of police heading into the sewers - \nMAYOR A training exercise, that's all.

SEWERS - CONTINUOUS \nHundreds of SWATs wade, flashlights swinging, heading towards the center... Teams are converging from different entry points... \nINT./EXT. CRUISER ON GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS \nBlake is on the phone. \nBLAKE I've been to half Daggett's cement plants, logged locations they've poured for underground construction... \nGORDON (O.S.) Anything strange about the pourings? Blake glances at a large map - dots mark pouring locations. \nBLAKE Honestly, Commissioner, I don't know anything about civil engineering. \nGORDON But you know about patterns. Keep looking. Blake pulls up in front of a cement plant. \nINT. REACTOR PLANT - CONTINUOUS \nDr. Pavel finishes his work. Turns to Bane. Grave. \nDR. PAVEL It's done. This is now a four-megaton nuclear bomb. \nBANE (to his men) Pull the core out of the reactor. \nDR. PAVEL \n(HORRIFIED) You can't. This is the only power source capable of sustaning it - if you move it, the core will decay in a matter of months. \nBANE Five, by my calculations. \nDR. PAVEL And then it will go off. \nBANE For the sake of your family, Dr. Pavel, I hope so. \nDr. Pavel stares as Mercenaries start to disconnect the core... \nEXT. CEMENT PLANT - CONTINUOUS \nBlake is led through a fence by a Worker. \nWORKER Boss is about to leave. Blake walks past cement mixers. Spots someone. A Driver. \nBLAKE Hey. The Driver turns. \nBLAKE That was you outside the stock exchange, right? \nDRIVER When? \nBLAKE When? When half the city's cops were trying to pull onto Castle Street and your truck shut them out. \nDRIVER Oh yeah. You're that cop - \nBLAKE Detective, now. \nBehind Blake the Worker puts his hand is his pocket... \nBLAKE And as a detective...I'm not allowed to believe in coincidences \nANYMORE - Blake spins, drawing his weapon. The Worker lunges with a knife, Blake smashes his hand to one side and shoots him. The Driver grabs him from behind. Blake wrestles, but the Driver is strong, trained. Blake can't aim his gun, he fires behind, into a steel mixer - the bullets ricochet, one catches the Driver in the back and he goes down... Blake, gasping, kneels beside the Driver. \nBLAKE What were you doing?! What?! \nThe man dies. Blake looks down at his gun. Disgusted. Tosses is down. Pulls out his phone. Dials. \nBLAKE Commissioner, I'm at the Fourteenth Street plant with two dead witnesses and a lot of questions. Call me - \nBlake freezes, stooped to pick up his gun. Looking at some empty barrels... Commissioner, they've got Polyisobutylene here... (Looks around.) And motor oil. They weren't making cement, they were making explosives - \nINT./EXT. CRUISER OUTSIDE CEMENT PLANT - MOMENTS LATER \nBlake grabs his carts - scanning the pattern of the dots - realizes. \nBLAKE Oh, God. \nBlake fires up the cruiser and pulls out, hard. \nINT./EXT.

Foley looks up with dread at the mouth of the tunnel. \n", "test2_id": 652, "test3_input": "FOX It was built as a fusion reactor. The first of its kind. Bane turned the core into a bomb, then disconnected it from the reactor. \nBLAKE And here's the important part. \nFOX As the device's fuel cells decay, it's becoming increasingly unstable...until the point of detonation. \nBLAKE The bomb's a time bomb. \nFOX And it will go off. In twenty-three days. Captain Jones reels at this news. \nBLAKE Bane's revolution is a sham. He's watching Gotham rearrange its deckchairs while the whole ship's going down. Your appeasement plan might not be as practical as you thought. Captain Jones throws Blake a look. Addresses Fox. \nCAPTAIN JONES Could you disarm it? \nFOX I don't know, But I could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it. \nCAPTAIN JONES We'd have to let the Pentagon know. \nSPECIAL FORCES 2 They'll be monitoring our \nFREQUENCIES - \nCAPTAIN JONES We have no choice. Let's move away from this location, then call it in. \nINT. TELLSONS BANK - MOMENTS LATER \nCaptain Jones exits the elevator, followed by his men and Blake.

Jones looks up at him, defiant. \nCAPTAIN JONES I'll die before I talk... \nBANE I'm on your schedule, Captain. \nBane places his hand over Jones's nose and mouth. \nMERCERNARY There were people living upstairs. \nBane looks up, disinterested. Jones is dead. \nBANE Give them over for judgement. (Indicates bodies.) Hang them where the world will see. \nINT.

SAME - LATER \nWayne does endless push-ups, squats, stretches. The Blind Prisoner listens. He speaks in an ancient tongue. \nPRISONER He says the leap to freedom is not about strength. \nWAYNE My body makes the jump. \nBLIND PRISONER \n(CRACKED ENGLISH) Survival is the spirit.

UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY \nWayne takes the rope at the foot of the climb. Prisoners look up, but none bother to gather round. Wayne starts climbing, determined. He FIGHTS the rock face...breathing hard. Grabs at a rock - it comes away in his hand. He DROPS - SMASHES into the rock face. The Blind Prisoner shakes his head. A Skinny Prisoner playing cards with the Prisoner looks up at Wayne, hanging upside down. \nSKINNY PRISONER Shouldn't you get him down?

And why do we fall? \nINT. CAVE PRISON - NIGHT \nWayne wakes with a start - the Blind Prisoner is there. \nBLIND PRISONER \n(CRACKED ENGLISH) You do not fear death. You think this makes you strong. This makes you weak. \nWAYNE Why? \nBLIND PRISONER How can you move faster then possible? Fight longer than possible? If not from the most powerful impulse of the spirit. The fear of death. The will to survive. Wayne gets up onto his elbow. Looks at the Blind Prisoner. \nWAYNE I do fear death. I fear dying in here while my city burns with no one there to save it. \nBLIND PRISONER Then make the climb. \nWAYNE How? \nBLIND PRISONER As the child did. Without the rope. (Dry laugh.) Then fear will find you again. Wayne considers this. \n", "test3_true": "Wayne puts some scraps of bread into a rough coat which he folds into a makeshift shoulder pack. \nPRISONER Supplies for your journey? Prisoners nearby laugh. Wayne moves to the cliff face. The Prisoner follows, intrigued by Wayne's new demeanor. The Tattooed Prisoner offers him the rope. Wayne refuses. Starts to climb. Prisoners gather around as word spreads. Wayne makes his way cautiously up the treacherous rock face. Down below the Prisoners start a low chant. As Wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something EXPLODES from the cliff face. Wayne flinches - BATS... They circle up to the opening above... Wayne closes his eyes. The chant RISES. Wayne takes a breath...opens his eyes...looks down at the drop...up again...then he jumps. \nTime skips a beat as the Prisoners stop breathing. And Wayne GRABS the ledge above.

Mercenaries come down into the chamber, pull out a man, who starts yelling. It is Stryver, Daggett's functionary. \nSTRYVER I want to see Bane! There's been a mistake! Take me to Bane!

There's been no mistake, Mr. Stryver. \nStryver turns to look at the 'judge': Dr. Jonathan Crane. \nCRANE You are Philip Stryver, executive vice-president of Daggett Industries?

Pull back to reveal a silent figure, watching. Bane. \nCRANE Bane has no authority here. This is merely a sentencing hearing. The choice is yours, death or exile. Stryver looks around, terrified, as the crowd shouts 'Death'. \nSTRYVER Exile. \nCRANE \n(SMASHES GAVEL) Sold...to the man in the cold sweat! Mercenaries pull Stryver from the dock... \nEXT. GOTHAM RIVER - DAY \nStryver, with other wealthy Gothamites, is led down to the ice. A Blackgate Inmate undoes his handcuffs, whispering. \nBLACKGATE INMATE Follow the tick ice. Try to swim - you're dead in minutes. \nSTRYVER Has anyone made it? The Blackgate Inmate turns away. Stryver is forced onto the ice. He shuffles forward, listening to the creaking... Stryver is a hundred yards out when the river swallows him. \nINT. EMPTY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nGordon stands over a map of the city. A handful of Cops sit around the room. Waiting. Gordon looks at his watch. \nGORDON Where the hell are they? It's not like we have a lot of time, here. \nCOP How long? \nGORDON The bomb goes off tomorrow. We've got about eighteen hours to do something. \nCOP To do what? \nGORDON We mark that truck. Get a GPS on it, then we can start thinking about how to take it down. The door opens and Blake enters, followed by ten cops. Gordon is counting them in. He moves to Blake. \nGORDON \n(LOW) That's it? Blake just looks at him. Gordon checks the faces. Realizes. \nGORDON Foley. Where's Foley, dammit?! Gordon heads for the door. \nBLAKE You shouldn't be out on the streets \nEXT. FOLEY'S BROWNSTONE - DAY \nGordon hurries up the steps to a brownstone. Stabs the bell. \nFOLEY'S WIFE Jim. He's not here - \nGordon, furious, addresses the hallway behind her. \nGORDON You're sending your wife to the door when the city's under occupation?! Foley appears at the end of the corridor. Ashamed. \nFOLEY Wait in the kitchen, honey. \nGORDON What did you do, bury your uniform in the backyard? \nFOLEY Jim, you saw what they did to those Special Forces. \nGORDON You forgotten all the years we went out on patrol with every gangbanger wanting to plant one as soon as our backs were turned? \nFOLEY This is different and you know it.

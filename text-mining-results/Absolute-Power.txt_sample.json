Wealth and power. \nWe're in rolling hill country.     The mansion is dark. Totally deserted. Silence. \nNow a sound - TIRES ON GRAVEL. A car comes rolling INTO VIEW. The motor of the car has been turned off. The lights of the car have been turned off. The car slides to a stop. Again, silence... \nHOLD ON mansion, a couple of hundred yards away.     There is a small field between the car and the estate.     Now -- \n11   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION/INT. LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT                11 \nA man holds binoculars, studying the place. He wears dark clothes, tennis shoes. He puts down the binoculars, begins to smear his face with black camouflage cream -- \n-- it's Luther, and he's been a  professional thief his entire life. He's a three-time   loser, but his last sentence was so long ago and his  skills are now so vast, so refined, that it is unlikely  he will ever get caught again. \n12   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT                        12 \nThe grounds as Luther glides through it.     He wears a backpack. \nThe night is cool. \nHe stops. All that separates him from the mansion now is a stretch of gorgeous lawn. Except for Luther, it isn't gorgeous -- it's no-man's land. \nOne final check of his surroundings -- then he sets off, in graceful motion, long strides eating up the ground. He makes no sound at all. \n13   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT                     13 \nThick wood with reinforced steel. \nLuther stops by the door, takes off his backpack, opens it. He puts on plastic gloves that have a special layer of padding at the fingertips and palms. Now he takes a key, inserts it in the front door, turns it, and the instant he pushes the door open -- ZOOM TO: \n14   INT.

It has two wires protruding from it. It is, we are about to find out, a tiny computer. Luther holds it like a baby. \nCUT TO: \n18   SECURITY DETECTOR                                            18 \nEighteen, seventeen -- \nCUT TO: \n19   LUTHER                                                       19 \nprobing with the wires into the heart of the security panel. \n(CONTINUED) \n19   CONTINUED:                                                 19 \nThe BEEPING is LOUDER still. \nThe security panel.

Chains leads from the crane into the water. \nDR. LIONEL HUDGENS (mid-60s), wiry and severe with a sharp intelligence, stands on the deck with CAPTAIN CHERNICK (late 40s). They look down at the water. \nCAPTAIN CHERNICK They say a sunken ship is like a grave. It should never be disturbed. \nHUDGENS I've been searching for the Erebus for twenty years, Captain. Now that I've found it, I'm afraid your ill-informed superstitions aren't enough to stop me. \nEXT. WATER SURFACE Two DIVERS in high-tech Newt Suits break the surface.

The chains run through the mechanism of the crane, pulling something to the surface. \nThe crane GROANS under the weight. Captain Chernick looks nervous as the crane SHUDDERS with the strain. \nEXT. WATER SURFACE Out of the ocean, the crane raises a large, heavy container. \nThe container is about eight feet long. It is battered and damaged by the ocean water, and covered in barnacles. \nINT.

The MESSAGES indicator blinks. Carnby presses the button to retrieve his messages. \nJOHN (ON THE MACHINE) Edward, John here. Hope things went well wherever you were this time. And, please, do not, I repeat, do not tell me about it. Every time you tell me about your latest case, I get nightmares for a week. Anyway, give me a call when you get back. Linda wants to have you by for dinner. Lord knows why, but she seems to like you. And if you haven't scared Aline away yet, bring her along. \nThe Loft is a large, incredibly cool-looking space. \nIn one corner is a lab area filled with high-tech scientific equipment. At another work station, dozens of drawings, maps, and photos are spread out next to a flat-screen computer. A few photos are tacked to a corkboard. \nSeveral bookshelves, all crammed with books, line one wall. A old framed photograph sits on a bookshelf, a faded photo of twenty CHILDREN sitting on the front steps of the Orphanage. Sister Clara stands with them. Young Edward sits to one side. \nA weapons cabinet features racks lined with guns and blade weapons. In another corner is a work-out area. \nThe sleek, modern kitchen and living quarters are in another corner. The bed is set up against a wall of large windows. \nOutside the windows, the sun is setting. \nApproaching the lab area, Carnby takes out the lynchpin artifact. He turns it around in his fingers, watching the light glint off it. \nEXT. DOCKS - NIGHT The Ship is docked at a mist-enshrouded pier. Overhead lights along the dock illuminate the area. \nA transport truck is parked on the Dock just next to the Ship's loading ramp. \nIn front of the ramp, five CREWMEN with automatic weapons stand guard, smoking and looking vigilant. \nSCENE 25 OMITTED \nEXT. SHIP DECK - NIGHT Standing on the Ship's wide deck, Captain Chernick looks impatient. Hudgens stands over the large, barnacle-covered container. The container is secured with a heavy rusted lock. \nTwo large, muscular men, the FIRST MATE and CREWMAN BARNES, check the chains connecting the container to the huge crane on the deck. They are preparing to load it onto the truck on the Dock. \nCAPTAIN CHERNICK Don't you want to open it? Make sure it's what you're looking for? \nHUDGENS The conditions must be perfect. Otherwise, there will be... consequences. \nCaptain Chernick steps up to the barnacle-covered container. He notices that a section of the barnacles have gotten scraped off in the transport. \nUnder the barnacles, the container is revealed to made of gold. Chernick look startled. \nCaptain Chernick rubs the gold spot on the container and looks closely at it. \nCAPTAIN CHERNICK Is this made of solid gold? \nHUDGENS Did you know the Abkani were the first civilization to use gold for their valuables? They believed it held the power to contain evil spirits. Thousands of years later, we don't even remember why gold was valuable to us in the first place. Now, let's load it onto the truck. \nCaptain Chernick exchanges a look with the First Mate and Crewman Barnes. They both give him a subtle nod. \nINT.

When did they first appear? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWith a remote control, Fischer clicks through images on the monitor as he talks. He brings up a series of anatomical schematics of the xenomorph creatures. \nFISCHER Two years ago. They've been 713's top priority ever since. But it's been almost exclusively in rural areas. This kind of urban infiltration is unprecedented. \nCARNBY Have you isolated any weaknesses? \nFischer brings up an image of the periodic table. \nFISCHER Most metals pass right through them. So normal bullets and blades are useless. But they're vulnerable to elements 76 to 79. Osmium, iridium, platinum, and gold.

It is a sleek, updated version of Carnby's para-meter, similar to the Agents' rifle-mounted scanners. \nFISCHER (CONT'D) This is calibrated to track their disruption field. It won't help you see them, but you'll know when they're nearby. \nFischer brings up a computer simulations of the creatures' disruption field, displaying how it works. \nFISCHER (CONT'D) They live almost exclusively in darkness. Sunlight's lethal in large doses. But only certain light frequencies hurt them. \nFischer takes a rifle off the rack and lays it down on the counter in front of them. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nOff another rack, Fischer picks up a lamp. He flips it on and off, shining the bright blue beam around. Fischer snaps the lamp into place at the top of the rifle. \nISCHER (CONT'D) These lamps are set to an effective frequency. \nFischer takes out several magazines of ammo out of the cabinet. He discharges a bullet. It glows yellow in his hand. \nFISCHER (CONT'D) But for maximum damage, we use bullets coated in a photon-accelerated luminescent resin. Cuts right through them. \nFischer hands the rifle and a magazine to Carnby. Carnby loads the magazine and checks the rifle like a pro. \nCARNBY I'm going to need a lot of those. \nSCENE 107A INCORPORATED INTO SCENE 107 \nSCENES 108 TO 114 OMITTED \nINT.

He looks exhausted. \nWarily, Carnby holds out the hand-held scanner, checking to see if it registers anything. But the Loft reads clean. \nCarnby puts the scanner down on a counter and allows himself to relax as he enters the Loft. \nCarnby walks in slowly, a man whose adrenaline is wearing off and is only now feeling the pain. He shrugs off his trench- coat and lets it drop on the floor. \nHe drops the duffle-bag on the floor. He kicks off his boots.

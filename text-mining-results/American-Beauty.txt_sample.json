That color! \nJIM #1 I just love your roses. How do you get them to flourish like this? \nCAROLYN Well, I'll tell you. Egg shells and Miracle Grow. \nJim #1 and Carolyn continue to chat, unaware that Lester is watching them. \nLESTER (V.O.) Man. I get exhausted just watching her. \nLester's POV: We can't hear what Jim and Carolyn are saying, but she's overly animated, like a TV talk show host. \nLESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) She wasn't always like this. She used to be happy. We used to be happy. \nINT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJANE is seated at her desk, working at her computer. \nLESTER (V.O.) My daughter Jane.

Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser, and... they're right. \nINT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - A SHORT TIME LATER \nCarolyn is driving; Jane stares out the window. Lester is asleep in the back seat. \nLESTER (V.O.) I have lost something. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but I know I didn't always feel this... sedated. But you know what? It's never too late to get it back. \nINT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nLester sits at his workstation, a BEIGE CUBICLE surrounded by IDENTICAL BEIGE CUBICLES.

And he's basically there to make it seem like they're justified in firing somebody, because they couldn't just come right out and say that, could they? No, no, that would be too... honest. And so they've asked us-- (off her look) --you couldn't possibly care any less, could you? \nCarolyn is watching this closely. \nJANE (uncomfortable) Well, what do you expect?

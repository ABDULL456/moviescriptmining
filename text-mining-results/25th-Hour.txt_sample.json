CAMPBELL-SAWYER CLASSROOM \nJAKOB ELINSKY stands at the blackboard, facing three rows of uninspired teenage faces. He wears a tweed jacket that seems a few sizes too large, with chalk stains on the sleeves. Jakob is the same age as Monty but he seems younger. There is something adolescent in his slouch, in the way he chews his lip. One of his students, MARY D'ANNUNZIO (17), stands at her desk, reading from a poetry textbook. Her eyes drown in pools of painted shadow, her hair is dyed black, tattooed roses garland her wrist. \nMARY \n-\u00ab=\u00b7-------\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7: .\u00b7    (reading)      - \u00b7\u00b7     --    \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \n\"Let us roll all our strength and all Our sweetness up into one ball, And tear pur pleasures with rough strife, Through the iron gates of life.\" Jakob watches her. We don't know the Campbell-Sawyer dress code, but we can guess that she's violating it . We can also guess that Jakob is watching her a little too avidly. Her pierced navel is visible below her Donnas tee-shirt. \nMARY (CONT'D) \n(reading) \"Thus, though we cannot make our sun Stand still, yet we will make him run.\" Mary shrugs and sits down. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJAKOB \nGood, good, excellent reading.

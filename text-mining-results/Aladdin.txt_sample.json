So, uh, this is your first time in the marketplace, huh? \n(ALADDIN pole vaults to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.) \nJASMINE:    Is it that obvious?

I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be. (He lays a plank between the buildings for her to walk over, but as he is leaned down, she vaults over his head.  He looks back in surprise.  She tosses the pole to him.  Both ALADDIN's and ABU's eyes bulge.) JASMINE:    I'm a fast learner. ALADDIN:    Right.  C'mon, this way.

Come and go as we please. JASMINE:    Fabulous. ALADDIN:    Well, it's not much, (he pulls back the curtain and exposes the palace) but it's got a great view. Palace looks pretty amazing, huh? JASMINE:    Oh, it's wonderful. ALADDIN:    I wonder what it would be like to live there, to have servants and valets... JASMINE:    Oh, sure.   People who tell you where to go and how to dress. ALADDIN:    It's better than here.  Always scraping for food and ducking the guards. JASMINE:    You're not free to make your own choices.

JASMINE:    What does it matter?  I ran away, and I am not going back. ALADDIN:    Really?  (He takes a bite from the apple in his hand, then hands it to ABU, who has a disgusted look on his face.)

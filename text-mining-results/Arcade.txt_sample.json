Where are the others? \nNick shrugs, looking elsewhere. \nSTILTS Sick? \nALEX Everybody's sick, huh? (glances at watch) It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that. \nSTILTS (to Nick) What's her problem? \nALEX Did you play ARCADE last night? \nSTILTS Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted... \nAlex nods, glaring at Nick.  His reluctance to believe her is understandable, but the events unfolding are scaring him. \nALEX You want to hear something else, Nick? I tried to call them this morning...Greg, Benz, Laurie...  Their phones are out of order. \nAlex reaches into her bag and pulls out a sheet of paper with names on it. \nALEX (continuing) And then I started thinking...about everyone else that was at Dante's yesterday.  I drew up this list. DeLoach, those other jerks ... their phones are out of order too. \nStilts starts HUMMING The Twilight Zone theme. \nNICK (annoyed) So what do you want me to do? \nAlex softens, then reaches for Nick's hand. \nALEX We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone... \nNICK No way. \nALEX If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure. (pleading) Come on, Nick. \nNICK Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean? \nNick and Alex rise. \nSTILTS So you guys are cutting school?  Lemme go with you. \nNICK Just stay here, Stilts. \nALEX (dead serious) And don't watch any television. \nStilts thinks Nick and Alex are involved in some sort of joke, but he's playing along, grinning. \nSTILTS Oh, okay.  Forget Twilight Zone, now we're talking Outer Limits here.  We control your horizontal, your vertical... \nNICK Just do what she says, Stilts.  And if we're not back... \nSTILTS I'll call the National Guard.  I got it under control. (giggles) Oh, just one more thing.

LEVEL SIX, SHOCK CORRIDOR -- NIGHT \nAlex steps out of a doorway into a long, narrow hallway. The hallway is mirrored on one side.  It has no doors or windows, and up ahead, it branches off to the right and the left. \nAlex turns and looks behind her.  The doorway she came through is gone now.  A mirrored wall stands in its place, with her own reflection staring back at her. \nTHE REFLECTION \nThere are subtle changes.  They shouldn't be noticeable at first, but the reflection seems somehow more threatening. \nAlex starts down the hall, her reflection keeping pace with her.  Up ahead, she hears a BUZZING noise, drawing closer. \nLIGHT flickers in the hallway to the left, presumably whatever it is that's BUZZING.  Suddenly a streak of light, running along the floor, turns the corner and heads down the hallway towards Alex. \nThe light hits her feet and SPARKS fly.  Alex SCREAMS and is thrown back against the wall, shocked.  The streak of light continues past her and disappears into the mirror at the hall's end.  It's like a moving electrical pulse. \nALEX \nShe's been given a pretty good jolt.  Her hands shake for a moment, an after-seizure of sorts, and she stands... \nHER MIRRORED REFLECTION \nis watching her, arms crossed.  This wouldn't be a problem were it not for the fact that Alex currently doesn't have her arms crossed! \nALEX (to her reflection) Fuck you. \nThe reflection grins and its/her eyes GLOW with fractals. \nALEX REFLECTION (in ARCADE'S voice) ANY TIME, BITCH. \nSpooked, Alex continues down the hallway, reaching the end and turning left... \nNEW CORRIDOR \nAlex moves quicker now, glancing left as her reflection follows. \nBUZZZZZ!!!  Here comes another streak of light, rushing in along the floor from a side corridor... \nAlex LEAPS over it, and it passes harmlessly under her. Now she's getting the hang of it.  She starts forward again. \nBUZZZZZ!!!  Here come two at a time from opposite directions... \nAlex has to jump left to avoid the first streak and lands directly in the path of the second.  Then she jumps back to the right again... \nTHE TWO STREAKS \npass by, zipping away from each other. \nANOTHER CORRIDOR \nThe pace quickens, with Alex racing down the corridors. She turns corner after corner.  It's become a virtual maze. \nWe cut back to Alex's \"STRENGTH\" and \"TIME ELAPSED\" meters again and again.  Both are shrinking away to nothing. \nAnd all the while, her reflection keeps pace with her, growing increasingly more nightmarish in appearance.  As Alex tires, the reflection seems to gain more strength. \nBUZZZZZ!!!  BUZZZZZ!!!  The streaks are shooting towards her with more frequency, and now they're racing along the walls too.  Alex is jumping left and right, with SPARKS exploding around her. \nTHE REFLECTION \nseems to be metamorphosizing.  Each time we see it/her, she looks a little different.  What's gradually happening (as time elapses) is that Alex's reflection is turning into The Screamer. \nAlex moves with increasing urgency as the streaks converge on her.  The corridors are filled with a constant BUZZING and flickering of light. SPARKS fly and Alex is shocked over and over. \nShe stumbles, falls to the floor, and rolls to the right, just missing a streak.  It cuts past her face, centimeters away. \nBEEP!  BEEP!  BEEP!  Off goes her wrist display!  Alex is up and running now, desperate. \nWe cut faster and faster  Alex running, the streaks of light, the reflection until... \nEND CORRIDOR \nShe's back where she started.  And the corridor dead-ends in a mirrored wall... \nBEHIND ALEX, \nDozens of light streaks are dogging her heels, literally just behind her.

It claws at its face, ripping the flesh away and revealing something altogether awful underneath. \nNothing could have prepared Alex for this.  It/ARCADE rises above her and it takes every ounce of her courage to keep from screaming.  Somehow, Alex finds a reserve of strength. \nAlex swings the sword and... \nARCADE SMASHES it aside.  It CLATTERS to the floor, useless.  But that's academic now as a gnarled hand clamps around Alex's throat. \nARCADE lifts Alex into the air and SLAMS her against a wall, pinning her there.  He thrusts his face into hers. \nARCADE YOU'RE TOO LATE, ALEX.  YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN TOO LATE.  AND NOW YOUR TIME'S UP.  YOU SEE, I NEEDED SOMEONE TO RETRIEVE MY HEART FOR ME.  I COULDN'T DO IT MYSELF.  THOSE ARE THE RULES.  BUT NOW THAT I'VE GOT IT, I'LL DESTROY IT. AND I'LL BE FREE OF MY PROGRAM, AND I'LL BE GOD.  THANK-YOU, ALEX. THANK-YOU SO MUCH. \nARCADE slowly squeezes her throat and Alex chokes, gasping for air that isn't forthcoming.  Tears well up in her eyes and her face turns red.  She tries to pry the bony, black fingers from her throat, but she can't... \nHER P.O.V. \nas she sees the faces of her friends.  Frozen.  Unable to help.  Then the images swirl and Alex begins to lose consciousness. \nARCADE YOU'RE NOT DYING YET, ALEX.  YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE FINAL LEVEL. LEVEL TEN. \nARCADE drops Alex to the ground, then wraps a hand into her hair and drags her across the floor... \nA DOORWAY \nstands in the darkness.  ARCADE rips it open, revealing absolute emptiness beyond.  It's like a doorway into space, a hole in the fabric of reality. It sucks the air into it, light...everything.  It touches some sort of primal fear. Gut instinct.  You don't ever want to go to this place. Ever. \nALEX (screaming) No! NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \nShe twists madly, trying to pull away, but ARCADE is too strong.  He shoves her through the doorway.  Her hands briefly latch onto the doorjamb.  ARCADE violently kicks her and her hands slip away.  They slip and she tumbles through. \nARCADE slams the door shut. \nARCADE GOODBYE, ALEX.  IT'S BEEN REAL. \nThese words appear on the screen, \"FINAL LEVEL -- THE REAL WORLD\" \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MANNING HOUSE, HALLWAY -- DAY \nAlex lands on the hallway floor, disoriented.  Somewhere, we can hear a clock TICKING.  But other than that the house is silent, in stark contrast to the storm of sounds a moment ago. \nTHE HOUSE \nlooks just like the dream/flashback we saw earlier. Everything is white. Bright and dreamlike.  Hyper reality. Alex looks up and... \nANOTHER ALEX \nis sitting in a chair nearby, back straight, hands clasped in her lap. Reserved. \nOTHER ALEX Time.  That's all I ever think about anymore.  It's like there's never enough of it, you know? \nThe other Alex vanishes.  Now the chair is empty.  Alex turns to look down the long hallway.  At the end of the hallway is the open door.  A door we've seen before.  The words fade in like phantoms... \nMAN (V.O.) So where are you then? \nALEX (V.O.) I'm in the past. \nALEX (a whisper) No ... oh no ... \nWith a building sense of dread, Alex moves towards that doorway.  She stops at the threshold, terrified. \nINT.

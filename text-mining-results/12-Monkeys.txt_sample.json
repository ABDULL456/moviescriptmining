It's welded. \nCOLE checks the grill anyway. \nJEFFREY See?  I toldja.  And all the doors are locked, too.  They're protecting the people on the outside from us.  But the people outside are as crazy as us. \nCOLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along the window sill.  He's staring at it when he's distracted by a sudden SOUND.  Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bed just as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with the blade of his flashlight. \nANGLE ON COLE, in bed, feigning sleep. \nThe flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close. \nFor a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING, SNORES, occasional MOANS.  Then, COLE hears JEFFREY'S hoarse whisper, picking up right where he left off. \nJEFFREY You know what \"crazy\" is?  \"crazy\" is \"majority rules\".  Take germs for example. \nAlthough COLE is preoccupied with the SPIDER struggling to get out of his fist, he can't help reacting to the word, \"germs\"! \nCOLE Germs?! \nJEFFREY In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible \"bad things\" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?...\"germs\"! \nAs JEFFREY warms to his subject, getting excited, COLE tries to figure out where to put the SPIDER. \nJEFFREY (cont.) So cut to the 20th century!  Last week in fact, right before I got dragged into this hellhole.  I order a burger in this fast food joint.  The waiter drops it on the floor.  He picks it up, wipes it off, hands it to me...like it was all okay. \nNo alternative.  COLE pops the SPIDER in his mouth and swallows it as JEFFREY prattles on... \nJEFFREY \"What about the germs?\"  I say.  He goes, \"I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!\" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you? \nCOLE I'm not crazy. \nJEFFREY Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out? \nCOLE If you know how to escape, why don't you...? \nJEFFREY Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word. \nCOLE What's that mean? \nJEFFREY I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS! TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS... \nPATIENTS are waking up as the NURSE and two ORDERLIES burst into the dorm and head straight for JEFFREY who's struggling to calm himself. \nJEFFREY Sorry.  Really sorry.  Got a little agitated.  The thought of escaping crossed my mind and suddenly...suddenly I felt LIKE BENDING THE FUCKING BARS BACK, RIPPING OFF THE GODDAMN WINDOW FRAMES AND...EATING THEM, YES, EATING THEM, AND LEAPING, LEAPING... \nCOLE watches the ORDERLIES grab JEFFREY and haul him away. \nJEFFREY You dumb assholes!  I'm a mental patient! I'm supposed to act out.  Wait til you morons find out who I am.  My father's gonna be really upset.  AND WHEN MY FATHER GETS UPSET, THE GROUND SHAKES! MY FATHER IS GOD!

Torture!  Experiments!  We're all monkeys \nCOLE locks up, startled, as JEFFREY, one eye bruised black, takes the seat next to him. \nCOLE They hurt you! \nJEFFREY Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty. \nANGLE ON TV, showing a laboratory CAT turning in mad circles, eating its own tail, while a NEWS REPORTER narrates. \nTV NEWS REPORTER (v.o.) These video tapes were obtained by animal rights activists who worked underground as laboratory assistants for several months.  Authorities say there is little they can do until... \nThe video footage now shows LAB WORKERS watching the results of their experiments passively. \nANGLE ON COLE, reacting angrily. \nCOLE Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out! \nJEFFREY (startled, turning) Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals. (sudden whisper) I didn't say a word about \"you know what\". \nCOLE What are you talking about??? \nJEFFREY You know -- your plan. \nAs COLE stares, befuddled, JEFFREY sees COLE'S magazine. \nJEFFREY What're you writing?  You a reporter? \nCOLE (shielding the magazine) It's private. \nJEFFREY A lawsuit?  You going to sue them? \nJust then BILLINGS looms over COLE, extending a cup full of pills. \nBILLINGS Yo, James -- time to take your meds. \nINT.

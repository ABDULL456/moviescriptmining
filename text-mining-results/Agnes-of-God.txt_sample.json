DISSOLVE TO: EXT - MONTREAL - NIGHT ", "truth": "\"MONTREAL, QUEBEC\". \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT - SUPREME COURT - DAY \nA normal busy day. A car pulls up with a woman and a man driving. The woman is MARTHA LIVINGSTON. She kisses the man (LARRY), gets out of the car, runs across the road dodgingtraffic and goes up the steps of the courthouse. There a group of REPORTERS there and a sudden bustle of interest. \nREPORTER Here they are now. \nMartha watches intently as 3 nuns, the Mother Superior, Sister Marguerite, and Sister Agnes (dressed in a white novices habit) and their LAWYER come out of the court escorted by police. The reporters leap on them, taking photographs, asking questions in English and French. Suddenly Sister Agnes looks right at Martha, then she is quickly bustled past. Martha goes on into the courthouse. \nINT - JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - DAY \nInside EVE, LYON, and JUSTICE LEVEAU are sitting. Martha is standing by the window smoking furiously. \nLEVEAU Martha, it's you. \nMARTHA What about Roger? He's free. \nEVE They want a woman. \nLYON All you have to do is meet with her once or twice... then tell the court she's insane. \nMARTHA Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here. \nEVE Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me. \nMARTHA Eve, she strangled a baby! \nEVE Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison. \nLEVEAU We're not telling you what to decide Martha. We're not even telling you to take this. \nLYON Is there any reason why you feel you shouldn't take it? \nMartha pauses for a long moment at the window, then turns. \nMARTHA Today's my birthday. I always make bad decisions on my birthday. \nThe Judge, Eve and Lyon all chuckle. The Judge throws the file down on his desk towards her. \nLEVEAU Happy birthday. \n15   INT - MARTHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMartha unlocks the door and comes in. She plays her answerphone and moves over to her cat. \nMARTHA \nHi, Kitty. \nThe answerphone whirs... \nSECRETARY (V.O.) Hi, it's Helen, calling to tell you that Mrs Davenport phoned to confirm her appointment at nine o'clock tomorrow, okay? Bye bye. \nSome whirs and clicks. \nROGER (V.O.) Hi Martha,    it's Roger. Can you call me at the    hospital. I'd like your opinion on a case.    Oh, bye the way, happy birthday.    Bye. \nSECRETARY (V.O.) Hi, Marty it's Helen again. I cancelled your Wednesday afternoon appointment so you can visit with your mother. Bye bye. \nMAN (in French) \nMartha picks up a news paper with a photo of Sister Agnes on the front. \n", "random": " large white figure is standing in the middle of the street, a figure of, ahem, a woman in her thirties.

Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth. (she stands) \nNo more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.

Angle on the courthouse. \n91   INT - COURT ROOM - DAY \nAll the main characters are present: Eve, Lyon, Martha, \nAgnes, Sister   Marguerite and Mother Miriam. Justice Leveau is summing up. \nLEVEAU In view of the situation as it now stands, and the testimony given here this morning, it seems quite clear that the defendant was in no manner responsible for her actions. It is therefore the judgement of this court that she be returned to the convent of Marie Madeleine where she will be cared for under proper medical supervision by a visiting physician. \nBoth Martha and Mother Miriam show relief at this. Justice Leveau continues to sum up in French when suddenly Agnes stands up. \nLEVEAU (Cont.) (surprised) Oui. Do you have something to say? \nAGNES (a long pause) I stood in the window of my room every night for a week. And one night I heard the most beautiful voice imaginable. And when I looked I saw the moon shining down on him. For six nights he sang to me, songs I'd never heard. And on the seventh night he opened his wings and lay on top of me. All the while he sang - (sings) Charlie Sweet... Charlie Sweet... Charlie's a... \nLEVEAU Please, remove her from the court. \nMartha and Mother Miriam step forward uncertainly. \nLEVEAU Would someone please remove the defendant from the courtroom. (continues in French) \nThe nuns lead Agnes, still singing past Martha and out of the court. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n92   EXT - CONVENT - DAY \nIt is full winter; many shots of the convent and surroundings dissolving into one another. \nMARTHA (V.O.) I don't know the meaning behind the song she sang. Perhaps it was a song of seduction. And the father was a fieldhand. Perhaps the song was simply a lullaby that she remembered from many years ago. And the father was hope and... and love and desire. And a belief in miracles. \nThe nuns are seen walking together through the snow back to the convent over    which Agnes' singing can be heard. \nMARTHA (V.O.) I want to believe that she was blessed. And I do miss her, and I hope that she's left something, some little part of herself with me. That would be miracle enough wouldn't it? \nDISSOLVE TO: \n93   EXT - TOP OF BELLTOWER - DAY \nWhere Agnes is singing her song among the doves. She stops singing and the music fades in on the same key. Agnes gently takes on of the doves and lets it fly away across the snowy landscape. \nFADE OUT.

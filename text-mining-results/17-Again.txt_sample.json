You should'a seen me! I humiliated Stan in front of the entire lunchroom. Everyone was clapping. The popular girls were begging to give me their numbers! \nED See what happens when you put a little lipstick on the pig? Did you manage to get sent to the principal's office? \nMIKE Man, I feel great! I even shot some hoops after school. No aches. No pains. Gotta run, Buddy. \nMike hangs up. \nEXT. MIKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe Aston Martin pulls up. Mike climbs out, walks to the door, takes a deep breath and rings the bell. \nSCARLET (o.s.) Coming! \nThe door opens revealing Scarlet in her dirty yard attire. \nSCARLET (CONT'D) I've been dying to meet you. I've known your father since...(gasps) \nScarlet...SPEECHLESS...visibly stunned by the resemblance... \nMIKE Is something wrong? \nSCARLET (FLUSTERED) No. It's just...you look like...No. I'm fine. Come in. Please. \nINT. MIKE'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nScarlet and Mike sit across from one another. Scarlet stares at Mike as if examining every pore on his face. \nSCARLET And you say Ed Freedman is your father? \nMIKE That's my dad. All 68 inches of him. \nSCARLET You don't look anything like him. If you don't mind me asking, who's your mother? \nMIKE My mother...she...she was...a... \nMike spies Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment on a table. \nMIKE (CONT'D) -a convict. In New Jersey. They met while dad was at Princeton. She was on parole. B&E, fist fighting, shanking. Nothing major. But she's dead now. \nSCARLET Oh?   I'm sorry. \nMIKE I warned her about kite surfing during hurricane season. So how are things with you? Doing anything exciting? Dating? Flirting with Dom Johnson maybe? \nSCARLET Why would you ask about Dom? Did Ed tell you to say that? \nMIKE I mean do what you want. You're a grown woman but, word on the street is Dom's been spreading gingivitis all over town. \nSCARLET I'll keep that in mind, Mark. \nScarlet can't take her eyes off Mike. \nSCARLET (CONT'D) It's crazy how much you like my husband when he was a teenager. \nMike switches subjects, points to her dirty clothes- \nMIKE You doing some gardening? \nSCARLET I am. I'm a landscape designer. I'm actually redoing the backyard. I'll show you. \nScarlet stands, leads Mike to the french doors. \nSCARLET (CONT'D) It's a work in progress so you'll have to use your imagination some. \nScarlet opens the doors, flips on the lights. The yard's been cleaned up. Fresh blankets of sod rest in piles next to stacks of limestone. HUNDREDS of unplanted plants, flowers, trees and shrubs sit around the yard in strategic positions. \nEXT.

As they reach the door, he steps in front of her. \nMIKE Let's see who the lucky guy is. \nMike swings the door open revealing...Dom Johnson. \nMIKE (CONT'D) I knew it! \nSLAM.   Mike shuts the door, blocks it. \nMIKE (CONT'D) I knew you had a thing for him! You can't do this! You took vows. What kind of example are you setting for the kids!? \nSCARLET Mark, I'm flattered. Really, I am. But I'm too old for you. \nScarlet moves Mike aside, opens the door.     Dom stands in the doorway holding a bouquet. \nDOM Wow. You look absolutely ravishing. \nMIKE Keep it in your pants, Casanova. \nSCARLET Don't mind him. You all set? \nDOM Let's do it. \nScarlet heads for the van.     Dom looks to Mike- \nDOM (CONT'D) Hey, kid...if the vans'a rockin'...well you know the rest. \nDom imitates humping, jogs after Scarlet. \nMIKE Don't you lay a finger on her, Johnson! I know where you live! \nMike slams the door. \nINT. MIKE'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT \nA contemplative Alex scoops lasagna onto plates.    An agitated Mike enters, pulls up a seat at the counter. \nALEX It's weird to think about my mom with someone other than my dad. \nMIKE It's adultery! If this were Afghanistan she'd be dragged through the village by goats.   You need to talk to her. \nALEX My mom's been pretty sad the past few months. She deserves to be happy. My dad obviously is...wherever he is. \nMIKE Maybe he's not? Maybe he wishes he could be here right now with you but there's a real good reason he can't be. \nALEX No, my dad's not a family guy. This is dumb but I used to tell him I was on the basketball team because I knew he'd never make it to a game. \nMIKE Then why would you tell him that? \nALEX I guess I was hoping it would make him like me more. \nMike is CRUSHED. \nINT. GUCCI STORE - DAY \nMike paces in front of a dressing room.   A SALESMAN waits by the door. \nMIKE My wife's moving on. My son doesn't think I like him and my daughter's in love with me. I need to change back, Ed. \nEd steps from the changing room wearing very tight, ultra hip clothes that belong on a 20 year old...he looks ridiculous. \nED What about college? \nMIKE I'm not going. I'll be a pharm rep til I die. I just want my family back. (BEAT) You're not gonna wear that, are you? \nEd checks his butt in a full length mirror, nods happily. \nED Baby's got back. \nEd retreats into the changing room. \nED (CONT'D) (o.s.) Now that Julie's agreed to go out with me tonight, I need you to start behaving. I can't have her thinking my son is a complete degenerate. \nMIKE Fine.

Party-Goers stop what they're doing and watch...not sure whether to laugh or join in. \nAnd then, the Bras fall in.      Followed by others.

I'm with someone else now. \nSTAN Yeah, right. Who'd be stupid enough? \nMAGGIE Him. \nStan turns angrily toward Mike as he approaches. \nMIKE Party's over, Stan.      You're out of here. \nSTAN Who's gonna make me leave?      You? \nMIKE I would but it smells like you've been drinking so I'll let the cops do it. \nMike pulls out his phone.      Stan looks to Maggie then back to Mike, laughs- \nSTAN You can have the nun.      She doesn't put out anyway. \nMIKE On second thought- \nMike SWINGS. Stan ducks, throws a giant uppercut. POW. Mike's eyes roll back in his head and WE cut to BLACK. \nINT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT/DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe HOSTESS shows Ed and Julie to their table by the window. Ed wears his new Gucci outfit. Julie's under dressed. \nHOSTESS There you are, Mr. Freedman. \nED Thanks. Put this towards your studies. \nEd hands the Hostess a 50.   Julie rolls her eyes. \nJULIE When you asked me to get together to talk about Mark this isn't what I envisioned. This isn't a date, Ed. \nED Are you insinuating that I'd use my son's misfortune just to go out with you? What kind of a father do you think I am? \nJULIE As long as we're on the same page. \nA WAITER approaches. \nWAITER Good evening. Would you care to see the wine- \nED Bring us the 1962 Petrus. \nThe Waiter nods, leaves. \nED (CONT'D) You're going to love this wine. $2000 dollars a bottle. \nJULIE I don't drink. So tell me what you think's going on with Mark? \nED It's baffling really but I noticed he's been drinking a lot of diet ice tea lately. Maybe he's gay? \nJULIE You didn't ask me here to talk about Mark, did you? \nED Do you like caviar?

Lindsey has even fallen asleep in her chair, her head buried in her arms on the table.  The shimmering tentacle enters the room in total silence.  It sways gracefully in to air, searching. It undulates across the room, hanging about five feet in the air, surveying everything.  It moves past Lindsey.  Sensing something, she lifts her head, turning... sees the apparition next to her. \nHer eyes go wide.  Amazement, but not fear.  The tentacle is moving on, still searching.  Lindsey shakes Bud awake, clapping her hand over his mouth. \nBud blinks twice, then freezes.  When she lowers her hand his mouth is hanging open like a total goon. \nBud chucks his pillow are Catfish, on the next table. \nCatfish cracks one eye open.  Turns away.  Turns right back... both eyes open now.  Sensing movement, the thing turn back toward them.  It seems to recognize Lindsey.  It doubles back on itself in a loop and comes right up to her.  She holds her ground, fascinated. \nThe bulbous tip forms suddenly into a human face... her face.  It is water, still clear and undulating... but definitely Lindsey.  She gasps in surprise. The liquid-Lindsey gasps soundlessly... a perfect mimic of her expression. Lindsey laughs involuntarily.  It laughs... without sound.  Lindsey makes a face, sticking out her tongue... testing it. \nThe liquid-Lindsey does the same.  Bud has just had the rug jerked out from under his sense of what is possible and what isn't, but he's taking it pretty will, considering. \nBUD (whispering) I think it likes you. \nLINDSEY It's trying to communicate. \nHer liquid face suddenly transforms into a likeness of Bud's. \nShe reaches out her hand slowly.  Gingerly, her fingers touch the surface. Ripples extend outward from the contact, across Bud's features. \nHer fingertips break effortlessly through the surface, just like she's dipping her hand into a bowl of water, except sideways.  She draws her wet fingers out and studies them, amazed.  Touches one fingertip to her tongue. \nLINDSEY Seawater. \nThe pseudopod pulls back from her.  It loops in the air dramatically, full circle... and ties itself into a knot.  As the knot tightens down, it melts back into the body.  The 'disappearing knot' trick. \nLindsey laughs, grinning with the open wonder and delight of a child at a magic show.  She is transported. \nLINDSEY Show off. \nShe looks at Bud.  He grins broadly.  He's with her now. \nThe stunned group watches as the thing moves on across the room.  Out to the corridor \nINT.

They see the pseudopod arching from the moonpool big as a treetrunk.  Coffey's mind is blown.  We can smell the insulation burning.  He just stares. \nINT. CORRIDOR/MAINTENANCE ROOM B                                        146 \nThe water tentacle enters and moves toward the hot-wired warhead.  It studies the device for a few seconds.  Bud and Lindsey enter through a side door, in time to see the tentacle divide into four tendrils which wrap around the warhead.  They begin to lift it off its cart. \nINT. SUB BAY                                                            147 \nCoffey finally jump-starts his brain.  In a flash of insight, he runs to the big sliding door through which the pseudopod stretches into the corridor.  He and Schoenick heave on the door.  Like a guillotine blade it slices effortlessly through it. \nVARIOUS ANGLES -- CORRIDORS, MESS HALL, LADDERWELL, MAINTENANCE... as the body of the pseudopod collapses, splashing on the floor.  It reverts to nothing more than a long puddle of simple seawater.  As the tendrils dissolve, the warhead slams back down onto the cart, unharmed.  ON COFFEY'S SIDE ON THE DOOR, however, the \"stump\" rears back like a cobra.  It withdraws rapidly into the moonpool.  The glow fades away. \nINT.

Lindsey is really strutting, high on life, now that she's been proven right. \nLINDSEY Okay, raise your hand if you think that was a Russian water-tentacle.  Lieutenant?  No?  Well, a breakthrough. \nCoffey is looking out from under his eyebrows like Nicholson in \"The Shining\". Bud give her a warning look.  Don't poke at the rattler. \nBUD You done impressing yourself, ace? \nONE NIGHT No way that could just be seawater. \nLINDSEY They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control. \nBUD Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water. \nCoffey is hunched over, elbows on his knees.  His hands are out of sight.  His arm is moving in a slow rhythm.  We can't see what he's doing. \nHIPPY That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV. \nCATFISH Just checking is out, huh?  How come? \nANGLE UNDER THE TABLE, showing what Coffey is doing.  He has his K-BAR KNIFE gripped white-knuckle in one hand.  He is drawing it slowly and repeatedly across the skin of the other forearm.  Neat chevrons of blood from wrist to elbow. \nC.U. COFFEY -- He doesn't flinch.  His eyes are hard and bright as diamond drills.  No one notices.  He's keeping the edge. \nLINDSEY They're curious, maybe.

He put three quick rounds into the ceiling. \nHIPPY SHIT! \nCATFISH Give me that!! \nHe grabs it out of Hippy's hands and aims it at the sub.  He racks the water with a long burst.  BENEATH THE SURFACE, the rounds nip nasty contrails through the water.  They barely scar the front port. \nLINDSEY Forget that... go for Big Geek! \nCatfish rakes the descending sub with more bursts, trying to hit the shimmering shape of the ROV on its back.  UNDERWATER we see the rounds arcing wild, a few hitting the ROV but causing little damage. \nCoffey complete his descent to just above the seafloor.  ABOVE, Catfish empties the weapon. \nBUD Gimme a hand! \nThey all turn.  Bud is fumbling into his wetsuit like a madman.  The others rush over to help him. \nBUD Get the rest of my gear.  Grab that hat there... let's go guys!  Come on, come on! \nCatfish slams a backpack onto Bud's shoulders, grappling with the straps and hose connections.  Hippy and Sonny (with one hand) are clipping, zipping and buckling all over him.  This is a world-record suit-up time.

The current slams him, spinning him like a fishing lure.  He pulls himself forward slowly until he can grip the stern rail of Flatbed's platform. \nLOW ANGLE, look up the wall.

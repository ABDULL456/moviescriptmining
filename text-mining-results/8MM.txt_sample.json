Like Shaft. \nWELLES Not quite. \nMAX From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here? \nWELLES Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money. \nMAX How much? \nWELLES How much do you make now? \nMAX Four hundred a week, off the books. \nWELLES Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days. \nMAX Sounds good, pops. \nWELLES Here's my number if you need it...

WELLES ROOM -- NIGHT \nWelles sleeps, despite the stead SOUND of TRAFFIC racing by his window.  The PHONE RINGS, waking him.  Welles looks at the clock radio, 2:23am, reaches to answer the phone... \nWELLES (into phone) ... Hello... ? \nMAX (V.O.) (from phone) Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight. \nEXT.  DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT \nAgainst the backdrop of downtown LA's bright skyscrapers, Welles' rental car heads into the lower bowels of the city, smaller, older, darker buildings... \nEXT.  DOWNTOWN STREETS -- NIGHT \nThe only people on the street are HOMELESS and SHADY CHARACTERS.  Welles' car makes its way to a big deserted PARKING LOT.  There are a few cars parked in one corner. \nWelles parks near the other cars and gets out.  Max stands against a chain link fence.  Welles goes to meet him. \nMAX Come on. \nMax leads the way, across the lot, towards dark alleyways. \nEXT.  DOWNTOWN ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT \nMax and Welles move through this filth strewn alley between decaying brink buildings.  They cone to a STAIRWELL leading down to pitch dark... \nINT.  OLD BUILDING -- NIGHT \nMax enters through a crooked door, heads into a narrow, labyrinth hallway lit by bare bulbs.  Welles follows. \nThey come to another STAIRWAY leading down.  At the bottom, a thick-necked GOON stands guarding double doors. \nGOON Are you a law enforcement agent or in any way affiliated with law enforcement? \nMAX Fuck you, Larry. \nMax heads to the double doors, waits for Welles. \nGOON (to Welles) Are you a law enforcement... ? \nWELLES No. \nINT.  BASEMENT -- NIGHT \nMax and Welles enter through the double doors, into a kind of small, underground porn flea market.  It's incredibly quiet.  About fifteen CARD TABLES are set up in rows.  The MEN behind the tables and the thirty or so \"CUSTOMERS\" looking through the merchandise make those in the previous porn shops look like high society. \nThese are MIDDLE-AGED MEN, most balding, some with pot bellies, in shorts and tube socks, in sweatpants and Members Only jackets: plain men, but with a look of desperation in their eyes, glancing around nervously, greasy and afraid. \nONE DEALER We're shutting down in fifteen minutes.  Fifteen minutes. \nWelles makes his way to the tables, wary.  One table is covered in dirty cardboard boxes, filled with HUNDREDS of PHOTOS of young children, mostly boys, naked.  Each photo is wrapped in plastic, censored by masking tape. \nWelles swallows back disgust. \nThe next table is piled high with used pornographic MAGAZINES.  There are baggies with COLORFUL PILLS laid out. X-rated Polaroids wrapped in rubberbands. \nMax follows behind, unaffected, smokes a cigarette. \nAnother table offers VIDEO TAPES with no identifying marks other than hand written labels with numbers written out, \"two,\" \"sixteen,\" \"five.\"  And many bootleg VIDEOS with grainy, homemade labels showing WOMEN in extreme BONDAGE. \nWelles watches out the corner of his eye as the PLUMP MAN beside him pays for a thick stack of kiddie porn pictures. Welles waits till the man moves on, addresses the angry looking DEALER who's counting money. \nWELLES (points to numbered videos) What are these? \nANGRY DEALER Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free. \nWelles looks around, wipes sweat off his top lip. \nWELLES Anything harder? \nANGRY DEALER There's nothing harder. \n", "random": "This stuff is being sold under the counter at the laundromat.

WELLES' HOUSE, BACKYARD -- NIGHT \nWelles enters his backyard, slowing, taking out his gun.  He keeps behind shrubbery, surveying his dark house. \nINT.

WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nDark.  Welles picks up the cordless phone, struggles to pry the receiver open.  He discovers another small BUG. \nHe drops the BUGS to the floor, crushes them under foot. \nHe puts the phone back together and is replacing it when it RINGS LOUDLY.  Welles is startled, drops the phone... \nWelles takes a breath, trying to shake off the jitters.  He picks up the RINGING PHONE, answers it... \nWELLES (into phone) Honey... ? \nMACHINE (V.O.) (from phone) Not quite. \nWelles stiffens. \nMACHINE (V.O.) Nothing like getting home after a rough day.  Home sweet home. \nWelles moves into the HALL, towards the front door... \nMACHINE (V.O.) Walk away.  Pack your bags, put the wife and kid in the car and find a place to hide.  If you're lucky, you'll never see me again. \nWelles takes out his gun, opens the front door, looking out. The street in front of the house is empty.  CRICKETS CHIRP. \nWELLES I don't know if I can do that. \nMACHINE (V.O.) I know who you are.  I know where you live.  I know everything I need to know to find you. (pause) Who am I? \nMACHINE is HEARD HANGING UP the phone. \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT \nCindy's crying.

What happened? \nWELLES I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me... \nAMY Tom... \nWELLES It has to be this way for now.

Why don't you answer your phone? \nWELLES I don't know.  I'm sorry... \nAMY You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think? \nAmy comes to take Cindy from him. \nAMY You owe me an explanation.

We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine. \nWelles walks ahead of Eddie, distraught, shining his flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor. \nEDDIE You'll never find her.  Nobody ever will, and even if they did, it doesn't mean nothing.  Bring in the cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em all.  Without the film, it never happened.  Don't you get it?  It's over.

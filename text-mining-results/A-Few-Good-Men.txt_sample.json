(to WEST) Captain, I appreciate your seeing me on such short notice. \nWEST I understand there was some trouble over the weekend down in Cuba. \nJO Yes sir... This past Friday evening. Two marines, Corporal Harold Dawson and Private Louden Downey, entered the barracks room of a PFC William Santiago and assaulted him. Santiago died at the base hospital approximately an hour later. The NIS agent who took their statements maintains they were trying to prevent Santiago from naming them in a fenceline shooting incident. They're scheduled to have a hearing down in Cuba at 4:00 this afternoon. \nLAWRENCE What's the problem? \nJO Dawson and Downey are both recruiting poster marines and Santiago was known to be a screw-up. I was thinking that it sounded an awful lot like a code red. \nJo lets this sink in a moment. \nWEST (under his breath) Christ. \nJO I'd like them moved up to Washington and assigned counsel. Someone who can really look into this. Someone who possesses not only the legal skill, but a familiarity with the inner workings of the military. In short, Captain, I'd like to suggest that... I be the one who, that it be me who is assigned to represent them. (beat) Myself. \nJo looks around the room for a response. \nWEST Joanne, why don't you get yourself a cup of coffee. \nJO Thank you, sir, I'm fine. \nWEST Joanne, I'd like you to leave the room so we can talk about you behind your back. \nJO Certainly, sir. \nJO gets up and walks out. \nWEST I thought this Code Red shit wasn't going on anymore. \nLAWRENCE With the marines at GITMO? Who the hell knows what goes on down there. \nWEST Well lets find out before the rest of the world does, this thing could get messy. What about this woman? \nLAWRENCE Jo's been working a desk at internal affairs for what, almost a year now. \nWEST And before that? \nGIBBS She disposed of three cases in two years. \nWEST Three cases in two years? Who was she handling, the Rosenbergs? \nGIBBS She's not cut out for litigation. \nLAWRENCE She's a hall of an investigator, Jerry -- \nGIBBS In Internal Affairs, sure. She can crawl up a lawyer's ass with the best of 'em, but when it comes to trial work -- \nWEST I know. All passion, no street smarts. Bring her back in. \nLAWRENCE goes to the door and motions for JO to come back in. \nWEST (continuing) Commander, we're gonna move the defendants up here in the morning. \nJO Thank you, sir. \nWEST And I'll have Division assign them counsel... \nJO (beat) But... not me. \nWEST From what I understand from your colleagues, you're much too valuable in your present assignment to be wasted on what I'm sure will boil down to a five minute plea bargain and a week's worth of paper work. \nJO Sir -- \nWEST Don't worry about it. I promise you, division'll assign the right man for the job. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

The '27 Yankees they're not, but they could probably hold their own against a group of, say, Airforce dentists. \nKAFFEE's in his late 20's, 15 months out of Harvard Law School, and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous spirit to drive it. He is, at this point in his life, passionate about nothing... except maybe softball. \nKAFFEE (calling out to the team) Alright, let's get two! \nHe smacks one to the SECOND BASE. The ball bounces right between his legs. \nSECOND BASE Sorry! \nKAFFEE Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby. Just look the ball into your glove. \nHe smacks one out to the same place. It bounces off the heel of SHERBY's glove and into center field. \nSECOND BASE (SHERBY) Sorry! \nKAFFEE You gotta trust me, Sherby. You keep your eyes open, your chances of catching the ball increase by a factor of ten. \nSPRADLING, a young naval officer, sweaty and out of breath, walks up behind the backstop. \nSPRADLING Kaffee! \nKAFFEE Let's try it again. \nSPRADLING Kaffee!! \nKAFFEE (turning) Dave. You seem upset and distraught. \nSPRADLING We were supposed to meet in your office 15 minutes ago to talk about the McDermott case. You're stalling on this thing.

It's Matthew Markinson. \n-- and KAFFEE jumps out of his skin. \nBecause sitting in the back seat, in civilian clothes, is MARKINSON. \nKAFFEE Jesus fucking Christ!!-- \nMARKINSON You left the door unlocked. \nKAFFEE Scared the shit outta me. \nMARKINSON Drive. \nKAFFEE Are you aware you're under subpoena? \nMARKINSON Yes. I'm also aware that the lives of two marines are in your hands. If there was something I could do about that, I would, but since I can't, all I can do is help you. Why don't you drive, Lieutenant. \nKAFFEE begins driving down the street. \nKAFFEE What do you know? \nMARKINSON I know everything. \nKAFFEE Was it a code red? \nMARKINSON Yes. \nKAFFEE Did Kendrick give the order? \nMARKINSON Yes. \nKAFFEE Did you witness it? \nMARKINSON I didn't need to -- \nKAFFEE Did you witness it?! \nMARKINSON No. \nKAFFEE Then how do you know? \nMARKINSON I know. \nKAFFEE You know shit. \nMARKINSON He was never gonna be transferred off the base. \nAnd with this, KAFFEE screeches the car over to the side of the road.

I'd ask the Court for a little latitude. \nRANDOLPH A very little latitude. \nKAFFEE Colonel? \nJESSEP I wore fatigues on the plane. \nKAFFEE And you brought your dress uniform with you. \nJESSEP Yes. \nKAFFEE And a toothbrush? A shaving kit? Change of underwear? \nROSS Your honor. \nKAFFEE (to ROSS) Is the Colonel's underwear a matter of national security? \nRANDOLPH Gentlemen.

(reading) Pairs of camouflage pants, 6 camouflage shirts, 2 pairs of boots, 1 pair of brown shoes, 1 pair of tennis shoes, 8 khaki tee-shirts, 2 belts, 1 sweater -- \nROSS Please the Court, is there a question anywhere in our future? \nRANDOLPH Lt. Kaffee, I have to -- \nKAFFEE I'm wondering why Santiago wasn't packed. \nThat landed. On the JURY, RANDOLPH, ROSS... \nKAFFEE (continuing) I'll tell you what, we'll get back to that one in a minute. \nJO hands KAFFEE the computer printout. \nKAFFEE (continuing) This is a record of all telephone calls made from your base in the past 24 hours. After being subpoenaed to Washington, you made three calls. \nHanding Jessep the printout -- \nKAFFEE (continuing) I've highlighted those calls in yellow. Do you recognize those numbers? \nJESSEP I called Colonel Fitzhuqhes in Quantico, Va. I wanted to let him know I'd be in town. The second call was to set up a meeting with Congressman Ramond of the House Armed Services Committee, and the third call was to my sister Elizabeth. \nKAFFEE Why did you make that call, sir? \nJESSEP I thought she might like to have dinner tonight. \nROSS Judge -- \nRANDOLPH I'm gonna put a stop to this now. \nJo's handed KAFFEE another printout and a stack of letters. \nKAFFEE Your honor, these are the telephone records from GITMO for August 6th. And these are 14 letters that Santiago wrote in nine months requesting, in fact begging, for a transfer. (to JESSEP) Upon hearing the news that he was finally getting his transfer, Santiago was so excited, that do you know how many people he called? Zero. Nobody. Not one call to his parents saying he was coming home. Not one call to a friend saying can you pick me up at the airport. He was asleep in his bed at midnight, and according to you he was getting on a plane in six hours, yet everything he owned was hanging neatly in his closet and folded neatly in his footlocker. You were leaving for one day and you packed a bag and made three phone calls. Santiago was leaving for the rest of his life, and he hadn't called a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. Can you explain that? The fact is there was no transfer order. Santiago wasn't going anywhere, isn't that right, Colonel. \nROSS Object. Your Honor, it's obvious that Lt. Kaffee's intention this morning is to smear a high ranking marine officer in the desperate hope that the mere appearance of impropriety will win him points with the jury. It's my recommendation, sir, that Lt. Kaffee receive an official reprimand from the bench, and that the witness be excused with the Court's deepest apologies. \nRANDOLPH ponders this a moment. \nRANDOLPH (pause) Overruled. \nROSS Your honor -- \nRANDOLPH The objection's noted. \nKAFFEE (beat) Colonel? \nJessep's smiling... \n...and now he can't help but let out a short laugh. \nKAFFEE (continuing) Is this funny, sir? \nJESSEP No. It's not. It's tragic. \nKAFFEE Do you have an answer? \nJESSEP Absolutely. My answer is I don't have the first damn clue. Maybe he was an early morning riser and he liked to pack in the nq. And maybe he didn't have any friends. I'm an educated man, but I'm afraid I can't speak intelligently about the travel habits of William Santiago.  What I do know is that he was set to leave the base at 0600. Now are these really the questions I was called here to answer? Phone calls and footlockers? Please tell me you've got something more, Lieutenant. Please tell me there's an ace up your sleeve. These two marines are on trial for their lives. Please tell me their lawyer hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone bill. (beat) Do you have any other questions for me, counselor? \nThe courtroom is silenced.

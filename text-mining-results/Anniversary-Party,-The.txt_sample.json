Monica and Ryan? \nMONICA Sally? \nSALLY Yes.  And you've met Joe. \nRYAN Yes. \nSALLY (a deep breath) Well, so glad you decided to come. \nMONICA We could hardly say no. \nSALLY Oh? \nJoe slips the coke into Monica's hand. \nSALLY (CONT'D) (takes the gift) Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night. \nRYAN At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape. \nSALLY You're keeping a record, are you? \nRYAN It's just very distracting when you're trying to work. \nMONICA Ryan. \nRYAN (to Joe) I'm sure you understand. \nSALLY Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis. \nRYAN Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself. \nMONICA Ryan! \nSALLY (cuts off response from Joe; to Ryan) Are you working on a new book? \nRYAN (caught short; flattered) Well, yes, actually. \nMONICA He always has two or three going... \nSALLY Really?

Or the Whitebread. \nMAC The gate was open. \nSALLY Well, not yet. (she reacts to Mac) The gate was open? \nJOE It's taken care of. \nMONICA I think Ryan needs a new publisher.

Her teammates are Panes, Sophia, Mac, Ryan, Sanford and Jeffrey. \nSALLY Panes? \nPANES From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle... \nMAC What? \nSALLY Trust him. \nPANES It's Shostakovich. \nRyan spots his book on the shelf and pulls it out, delighted. \nSALLY Sandy... \nSANFORD The Wind Up Bird Chronicle. \nSALLY (turns to him) Ryan? \nRYAN (pleased) I didn't know you had this. \nSALLY Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us? \nRYAN Absolutely.  You always wonder where your books end up.

LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJoe's team works on it's clues.  Teammates: Gina, Cal, Clair, Skye, Monica, Jerry and Mary-Lynn.  Everyone is talking over each other and fighting for attention.

You're last, Cal. \nCAL Why last? \nMONICA The Katzenjammer Kids. \nThere's a hush. \nMONICA (CONT'D) You know.  It's the Funnies.  The Katzenjammer Kids.  It's my mother's favorite charade's clue.

MEDIUM SHOT - CLAIR Clair is climbing up the pool steps. CLAIR Has anyone seen Mac? ", "truth": "CLAIR I'm so good. \nShe kisses Joe and Cal, and goes off to find her husband. \nCAL Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you. \nJOE No, what? \nCAL The movie. \nJOE Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay? \nCAL I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue. \nJOE Who, Sally? \nCAL And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death. \nJOE I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors. \nCAL Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place. \nJOE What? \nCAL Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend. (to Joe's stare) I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand... (into the silence) You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess. (throws an arm around him) Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  \"Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more...\" And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film? \nJOE (stares at him) Leo? \nCAL Any thoughts on casting yet? \nJOE (regards him) Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed. \nCAL Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting? \nJOE October-ish. \nCAL I have a small window of time. \nJOE Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal. \nCAL Scratch the two, write in a four. \nJOE Scratch the two, write in a four. \nCAL You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine. \nJOE Five years ago, I was at the party, remember? \nJoe looks up and sees Sally standing in the sun room.  He blows her a kiss.  She kisses her finger tips and puts her hand flat against the window pane. \nINT. BEDROOM CLOSET - TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY \nShe's in her wardrobe pacing back and forth a bit frantic. Trying on clothing, tossing garments to the ground.  The floor is a heap of discarded ideas.  She pulls on jeans and a t-shirt.  Very similar to what Skye is wearing.  She sits a moment on the floor.  The sounds of the party below are muted. \nSALLY (O.S.) Oh Warren, that was awful, I can't sing. \nThe CAMERA stays with Sally as she gets to her feet, walks along the corridor, toward the sound of her voice. \nINT.

(O.S) You seem so alive up there. \nSally stands at the open door.  Stunned.  Watches Mac watch her.  Watches herself, with a professional, acute eye.

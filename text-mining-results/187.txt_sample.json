All are 17. Cesar has a buzz-cut, Stevie's an Anglo speed freak with a runny nose and a bleached one-clip haircut (roots showing) and Paco, a Latino. \nTREVOR Sit down, please. \nCesar, Stevie and Paco ignore Trevor and walk out of the bungalow. Their departure is accompanied by a tumultuous outburst of catcalls and whistles. \nLAKESIA (peeking Benny's hold card) Mr. G, those guys that jus' walked out aren't even in here this period. (pointing to Benny) And this fool's name is Benny Chacon. \nBENNY (whirls in his seat) Shut yer mouth, hood rat! School girl bitch! \nTREVOR Okay, Benny.   That's enough. \nBenny turns his wrath on Trevor now. \nBENNY Hey, you ain't no real teacher. Fool, you're nothin' but a sub. T'ink yer so cool... You mus' be 'Mr. culo.' \nScattered laughter. Trevor closes the sub folder and just looks at Benny. \nTREVOR (a cool curiosity) Why do you wear a rosary? \nBENNY (reacting) Ain't none a' yer damn business. To put God on me, okay?

A palpable beat. \nTREVOR Are you done? \nThere is dead silence as Benny stares Trevor straight in the eye. Trevor stares right back. \nBENNY Jus' gimme a referral.    Shit. \nTrevor turns and calmly walks back to the island counter, searches and finds a referral slip in one of the drawers, fills it out... \nTREVOR (cool deliberation) For future reference, anyone who disrupts a class, or in any way infringes on the rights of others to get an education, is subject to disciplinary action. (beat) When I'm here, ladies and gentlemen, I expect to be treated decently... (walks back to Benny) ... hopefully in an atmosphere of mutual respect. This classroom is our sanctuary, yours and mine. Respect it.

Don't get me wrong, Benny's made my life a living hell. I even moved back in with my mother because of him. I love my mother, but if I eat one more dinner off a TV tray or watch one more rerun of 'Wheel of Fortune,' I think I'll lose my fucking mind. \nNow an EGG TIMER RINGS O.S. on Ellen's desk.

The Algerian shivers from the cold. He is completely naked. He laboriously puts on the fatigues which are too big for him. 
MATHIEU Go on, give him the cap. 
They give him a wide belt and buckle it. The other paras, one on either side of him, pull up his sleeves to the elbows. A third places the cap on his head and cocks it. 
LAGLOY Nationalized! 
The colonel turn to him angrily: 
MATHIEU Don't be an idiot, Lagloy! 
The Algerian is ready. The paras look at him repressing their laughter. The Algerian continues to tremble. His breath is short, his eyes glossy. He is crying. 
CAPTAIN Let's go. 
The Algerian looks around. He breathes deeply. Then, suddenly, unexpectedly, he lets out a hoarse cry: 
SADEK No! 
and tries to jerk forward toward the window. 
Marc seizes him immediately, and with his right hand grabs him by the chest, almost lifting him. With his left hand he gives him two quick slaps, not very hard. 
MARC (persuadingly) What do you think you're doing, you fool? Do you want us to start all over again? C'mon, be good. Don't make me look like an idiot in front of the others. 
He makes a reassuring sign to the colonel. Then, he takes the Algerian by the arms, and they move off. 
2	STREETS OF ALGIERS. OUTSIDE. DAWN. OCTOBER 7, 1957. 
The city is gray and white, by the sea which looks like milk. The dawn outlines her features sharply. 
The streets and wide avenues of the European quarters are empty. Silence, until gradually is heard ... 
A HUMMING OF MOTORS. 
One truck after another. Their headlights on, with an opaque glow, by now useless. 
A line of trucks follow one another along the sea-front, all at the same speed. 
They turn right and go up toward Place du Gouvernement. 
Here, without stopping, the columns divide in two. The two lines enter each of the two roads that lead up to surround the Casbah. 
In the brighter light, the Casbah appears completely white, limestone. Enclosed by the European city, it stands at a greater height and overlooks it. 
Mosaic of terraces. White pavement, pavement interspersed by the black outlays of narrow alleys. Only a jump from one terrace to another ... 
Agile and silent, the paras jump one by one from the trucks in a hurry. 
SOUND OF TRUCKS. 
They arrange themselves geometrically, their movements synchronized. They disperse and disappear in the alleys. 
They reappear together, then once again scatter. 
They meet without looking at one another; each one takes his own course. 
In like manner without a sound, they are above, even on the terraces, in perfect geometry. Even up here, the paras tighten their grip ... 
3	RUE DES ABDERAMES. COURTYARD OF HOUSE. INSIDE/OUTSIDE. DAWN. 
Every three yards, there is a para, even at all four corners of an intersection. 
They are also in the side streets as well as the main streets. 
And also above, against the sky, many other paras appear. 
Number three. The doorway is the height of a man. A squadron stands ready in a semicircle with machine guns in firing position. 
Marc continues to hold up the Algerian by his arm. 
The captain glances at his watch, then looks up at the terrace and gives a signal. 
In a lowered voice, without turning around, he speaks to the para who is at his back: 
CAPTAIN Fire ... 
The para nears the front door, his legs wide open, his machine gun, clenched at his side, and aims at the lock.

WINNIE (CONT'D) It's beautiful. 
JACOB Yeah... 
WINNIE It's too expensive. We'll return it. 
JACOB No. 
WINNIE Jacob I don't care about what ring you give me. You know that. 
JACOB We're not taking it back. I worked hard for that ring and I want you to wear it. She regards him... he's serious. 
WINNIE Okay. 
He moves to her... takes the ring and places it on her finger. Then Jacob pulls her into his kiss... it's almost violent. She's taken off guard. And as they fall into each other then back onto the bed...

JACOB Who are the big players in diabetes treatments? 
AUDRY Lilly, Abbot, OSI, Inverness. 
JACOB Is anyone riding on something in phase three?

AUDRY (CONT'D) Oh, this takes me back to when I had a job... He stands over her shoulder. 
AUDRY (CONT'D) Yeah, Amlyn pharmaceuticals has Byetta going in front of the FDA next month. I remember this... 
(MORE)

JACOB How did they die? 
AUDRY I don't remember. 
JACOB Pancreatitis?

JACOB How did he know? 
AUDRY Who? Without answering her... 
JACOB Can you look up large institutional ownership? 
AUDRY Mutual or hedge? 
JACOB Hedge. 
AUDRY Locust Fund owns a shitload. And she looks over to Jacob with...

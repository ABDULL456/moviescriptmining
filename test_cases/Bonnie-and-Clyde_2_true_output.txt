CLYDE (straightening up, matter-of-fact) Bonnie's hungry, C.W. I saw a chicken place a few miles back. Who all wants to go get some food? 
INT. MOTEL BEDROOM.  GROUP SHOT.  DAY. 
BLANCHE (rising from her chair, a little shaken at Bonnie's outburst) I sure do.  I'm plenty tired of sittin' around here anyway. 
BUCK (not making a move to get up) You can't drive, honeylove. 
C.W. (reluctantly) I'll go. 
CLYDE makes a face to BONNIE pretending there's something going on between C.W. and BLANCHE.  BONNIE tries to keep from being amused.  C.W. moves out with BLANCHE.  BUCK rises to go next door. 
C.W. What's everybody want? 
CLYDE Just five chicken dinners, and get somethin' for dessert. 
BUCK See if they got peach ice cream. (he grins and pats his stomach) 
All finally exit, leaving BONNIE and CLYDE alone. 
EXT. CAR AND STREET.  DUSK. 
C.W. and BLANCHE go out.  We go with them.  They get in the car and drive off.  BUCK enters his cabin. 
INT. MOTEL BEDROOM.  BONNIE AND CLYDE.  DUSK. 
CLYDE reaches her, and for a moment both stare with fanatic intensity at each other, BONNIE trying desperately to keep a straight face.  They are nose to nose, unblinking.  CLYDE gives her a big raspberry, waggling his fingers in his ears like a kid.  She laughs. 
BONNIE I hate you all. 
CLYDE I hate y'all, too. 
BONNIE no, I really hate you. 
She turns away from him, wilts onto the bed. 
BONNIE (eyes brimming) Oh, baby, I've got the blues so bad... 
CLYDE moves behind her, begins to massage her back.  There is something very delicate about the way he touches her; it suggests CLYDE's sensitivity to her mood rather than any degree of physical intimacy. 
CLYDE Bonnie?...is it your mama, what your mama said? 
BONNIE What mama?...she's just an old woman now...I have no mama... 
BONNIE rolls over on her back, stares up at CLYDE, tears splaying across her face from the move. 
BONNIE (quietly) ...so funny...I thought when we first went out, we were really goin' somewhere...but this is it-- we're just goin', huh? 
She has addressed this last directly to CLYDE, but there is nothing rhetorical about it--it is a real question.  CLYDE doesn't answer for a moment.  Then: 
CLYDE Do you care about where we're goin'? 
BONNIE clearly finds this hard to say: 
BONNIE Not as long as you care about me. 
CLYDE (quite simply) Why I love you, sugar. 
It's the first time he's said it to her, and BONNIE is overwhelmed.  She wraps her arms around CLYDE's middle, and snuggles into him, like a child.  Neither we nor CLYDE can see BONNIE's face now, and her voice is muffled by his chest. 
BONNIE'S VOICE --enough to die with me, baby?... 'cause I think that's where we're goin'...I surely do. 
CLYDE is both touched and amused by the plea.  He strokes her head lightly.  Really meaning it. 
CLYDE --wherever. 
DISSOLVE: 
INT. CAR. 
BLANCHE, her tense and agitated self growing increasingly more so lately, lights a fresh cigarette off the butt of the one she has been smoking. 
C.W. (conversationally) You sure smokin' all the time lately.

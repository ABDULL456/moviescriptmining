{"test1_input": "...a drummer takes a wild solo. Enraptured, Allen taps his fingers to these new rhythms. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY \nAllen's fingers typing in these same rhythms. Beside, The New Yorker advertising Ogden Nash's upcoming reading. \nLUCIEN (O.S.) Extraordinary men propel society forward. It is our duty to break the law. \nINT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - DAY \nAllen stopping Lucien in his tracks. \nALLEN Really? \nLUCIEN It's how we make the world wider. \nAllen considers, agrees. \nALLEN You are an extraordinary man. \nLucien beams. \nLUCIEN Well, thank you. \nINT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - AN HOUR LATER \nBill at David's bookcase, removing classic art and literature books and throwing them to Allen. \nBILL (O.S.) \"Return of the Native.\" \"Leviathan.\" Tear `em up boys. Destroy the old and build the new! \nAllen, with scissors, cuts up pages of the books. Hands them to Lucien who nails them to the wall. \nIt's a frantic assembly-line: Bill whips books to Allen, Allen tears out sections, and Lucien hammers them up. \nWe PULL BACK to see the entire wall is covered in words. \nINT. HARLEM NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT \nTime suddenly slows. The music tapers, the hands of the drummer taper down to a still. Allen looks around, scared and confused. What is happening? \nA spotlight cuts through the room, capturing the singer's sweaty ecstasy, the bassist's fingers mid-plucking. The room freezes. \nUnlit cigarette dangling from his lip, Allen turns to Bill. \nBill holds up his finger - it is on fire. He lights Allen's cigarette with the flame. We have entered into another universe. \nLucien stands -- the only thing moving -- and Allen follows. He steps into the frozen moment. And it's beautiful. \nLUCIEN Watch this. \nLucien leans over a young woman, a statue at a table with a young man in military attire. \nLUCIEN (whispered in her ear) Go. \nThe girl comes to life and clambers over the young man to a second, more attractive soldier. And kisses him. The pair erupt into life, into desire. \nLucien and Allen sit on the stage beneath the frozen musicians. Lucien pulls out a BOY SCOUT KNIFE. \nWraps Allen's hand in a fist around the blade. \nHe pulls the knife free. Allen winces in pain. \nLucien does the same to his own palm, then presses their two bloody hands together. A ceremony. Allen's eyes roll back. \nDavid appears in a janitor uniform. The Technicolor fades. \nDAVID What the hell is this? \nCUT TO: \nINT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAllen, the nitrous oxide mask over his face inhaling from a tank of gas. He has been adrift in a hallucination. \nLucien presses Allen's hand back and forth, both unharmed. \nBILL Time slows down as you drift deeper and deeper into your cave... \n", "test1_true": "BILL We are exploring the avenues of Allen's mind. \nDavid looks around the mess of his living room, his pillaged library of books, papers all over the floor. \nDAVID Dimly-lit, I am sure. What have you done to my apartment? \nAllen struggles to his feet, moaning. Lucien steps between David and their wall of clippings. \nLUCIEN David, don't touch anything. We have to write it all down. \nBill stands up, woozy. Calls out to David. \nBILL Get this man a pair of scissors! \nDAVID This is not your revolution, this is my life. \nBILL What kind of life is it? \nDAVID It's mine. Not everyone gets an allowance. (beat) Leave. Get out! \nAllen stumbles out of the room, scared. David approaches Lucien. \nDAVID I need to speak to you. Alone. \nINT. BATHROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAllen splashes water on his face. In the mirror, he sees David and Lucien in the bedroom. \nDavid hands Lucien a TERM PAPER. \nLUCIEN (O.S.) It only has to be five pages. \nHe tilts the mirror to see them clearly. A glimpse into their private dynamic. \nINT. BEDROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT \nLucien flips through the term paper. \nLUCIEN You make me too smart, they're gonna suspect something's up. \nDavid throws Lucien's coat over his shoulder. \nDAVID And get you sent back to your mother again? That would just be the end of you. \nLUCIEN Fuck you. \nDavid spots Allen watching from the bathroom. \nINT. BATHROOM - 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAllen, caught, looks down, pretends he heard nothing. But it's too late. David walks over and SLAMS the door in Allen's face. \nPROFESSOR STEEVES (O.S.) Kill your darlings. \nINT. LECTURE HALL - DAY \nProfessor Steeves, intent, in front of the class. \nPROFESSOR STEEVES Your crushes, your juvenile metaphysics. None of them belong on the page. It is the first principle of good creative work. A work of fiction you will deliver as your final exam. \nHe sees Allen, badly hungover and brooding, writing in a journal. Ignoring class. \nPROFESSOR STEEVES Oh look. Whitman Jr. graced us with his presence today. \nSteeves walks to Allen's desk, grabs his journal. \nPROFESSOR STEEVES \"The New Vision. Extraordinary men propel us forward. It is our duty to break the law.\" (to Allen) Fantastic. \nALLEN There's more life in those five pages than in the dozens of bad sonnets we've read in class. \nSteeves cocks his eye, stares down Allen. The first time Allen has defied anyone. Ever. \nPROFESSOR STEEVES You want life? You want the world on fire? \nSteeves motions to the door. Then to Allen. \nPROFESSOR STEEVES The war awaits. What will it be? \nSteeves tosses the journal back down on Allen's desk. \n", "test1_id": 2727, "test2_input": "The dingy drifts into view in the middle of the busiest river in the world - quiet at this late in the night. Jack rowing. \nJACK A \"new vision?\" \nALLEN Yeah. \nJACK Sounds phony. Movements are cooked up by people who can't write about the people who can. \nLUCIEN Lu, I don't think he gets what we're trying to do. \nJACK Listen to me, this whole town's full of finks on the 30th floor, writing pure chintz. Writers, real writers, gotta be in the beds. In the trenches. In all the broken places. What're your trenches, Al? \nALLEN Allen. \nJACK Right. \nAllen looks to Lucien for help. \nLUCIEN First thought, best thought. \nALLEN Fuck you. What does that even mean?! \nJACK Good. That's one. What else? \nALLEN Fuck your one million words. \nJACK Even better. \nALLEN You don't know me. \nJACK You're right. Who is you? \nLucien loves this, raises an eyebrow. Allen pulls out his poem from his pocket. \nALLEN Be careful. You are not in wonderland I have heard the strange madness long growing in your soul. But you are fortunate. \nLucien listens anew, realizing this poem is about him. \nALLEN In your ignorance In your isolation, you who have suffered Find where love hides. Give. Share. Lose. Lest we die unbloomed. \nJust the sound of the water. Completely vulnerable, Allen sits back down. \nJACK Allen. Beautiful, kid. \nAllen looks up, moved. \nLUCIEN You wrote that? \nALLEN You asked me to. Remember? \nLucien lights up. He comes forward, gathers his friends close: gawky, emotional Allen. Blustery, sensitive Jack. \nLUCIEN Forget Columbia. Forget Ogden Nash. Here's the plan, boys. We join the Merchant Marines. Sail the world until the war ends. Then jump ship and make it to Paris. For the liberation. \nALLEN You don't speak French. \nLUCIEN Jack does. It'll be us, together. At the beginning. It'll be the perfect day. \nA FLOOD-LAMP and HORN shatter the reverie. \nA COAST GUARD patrol boat has caught them. A megaphone squawks to life. \nPOLICE OFFICER Don't MOVE! \nJACK Jesus Christ! \nPOLICE OFFICER Put your hands in the air! \nThe boys, trapped, look at each other terrified. The BLAST of the horn sends up to... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY, OUTSIDE COLUMBIA DEAN'S OFFICE - DAY \nAllen, nervous waits outside. Lucien already inside getting reprimanded by the Dean. Allen can hear the conversation through the door. \nHe leans in closer. \nDEAN (O.S.) You've managed to matriculate and drop out of Tulane, Bowdoin, University of Chicago. \n", "test2_true": "Lucien in a leather-backed chair. The DEAN (40's, sardonic) overlooks Lucien's record. Lucien's mother, MARION CARR, a fallen matriarch, smokes with dispassion. \nDEAN Your attendance record here is abominable. You've ignored curfew. Your papers, when you bother to turn them in, exceed the assigned page limit. Can you explain why you're at Columbia? \nLUCIEN Same reason you're here. \nDEAN What's that? \nLUCIEN Loose Barnard girls. \nMarion Carr looks at the Dean with a weary smile. \nDEAN I know about your difficulties. About what happened in Chicago. \nA pale comes over Lucien's face. Which becomes absolute fury. \nLUCIEN (to Marion) You told him?! \nMARION CARR He's not the enemy. \nDEAN See, the University acts in loco parentis. You are our responsibility. We're trying to find someway to make this all work. \nLucien EXPLODES. \nLUCIEN Who said anybody could know anything about anything?! \nMARION CARR Lucien, your temper! \nINT. HALLWAY, OUTSIDE COLUMBIA DEAN'S OFFICE - DAY \nAllen sits back as he hears someone approaching. \nLouis Ginsberg rounds the corner with an unfamiliar woman. \nLOUIS (O.S.) Allen? What the hell is going on? \nALLEN Who's she? \nThe woman, EDITH (early 30s, Jewish, shy), waves nervously. \nEDITH Hi. I'm Edith Cohen. \nALLEN What's she doing here? \nEDITH I'll go wait outside. \nEdith exits down the stairs. \nALLEN (smirks) So that's why you locked mom up. \nLouis SLAPS his son. \nLucien storms out of the Dean's office, followed by Marion, putting on her fur coat. Marion inspects her son's new accomplice then races after her son. Louis motions to Lucien. \nLOUIS Did he put you up to this? \nAllen stares down his father. Gathering courage to defy him. \nALLEN No. I stole the boat. And it was tremendous. \nEXT. SEMINARY GARDENS - NIGHT \nIn the quiet, Lucien smokes and stares up -- he looks ravaged. A suitcase beside him. \nAllen approaches, surprised. \nALLEN Where are you going? \nLUCIEN You know me now. I'm only good at beginnings. \nALLEN You're dropping out? \nLUCIEN Best of luck. \nAllen GRABS Lucien's suitcase and sits beside Lucien. This explodes out of him. \nALLEN My father shows up yesterday with some new woman. And in the middle of the Allen's-a-screw-up monologue, all of a sudden, I realize: I don't care. I've never not cared. So, I told them it was my idea. To steal the boat. \nLUCIEN Why? \n", "test2_id": 2728, "test3_input": "Norman offers the box of morphine to Bill. Bill handles it.

Some went clean through. \nINT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJack continues to listen to Sammy, his heart sinking. He knows this is headed to a dark place. \nSAMMY (V.O.) They're not even trying to take it out no more. \nINT. CRAPPY HOTEL, 42ND STREET - NIGHT \nAllen's heart in his throat as he steps out of his pants. He is nearly naked. Vulnerable. \nEXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT \nLucien throws his flask into the woods, LASHES out at David. \nINT. BILL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nBill injects the syrette into his wrist. And presses the oblivion in. \nSAMMY (V.O.) The nurses gave me the same morphine I gave to dying boys... \nINT. CRAPPY HOTEL, 42ND STREET - NIGHT \nAllen, naked, lays on the bed.

DORM HALLWAY - DAY \nAllen steps out in a bathrobe, to see a POLICEMAN and a DETECTIVE whispering outside Lucien's room. \nPOLICEMAN He didn't come back here afterwards. Nobody on the floor saw. \nThey stare at Allen, studying him. Other students whisper. \nPOLICEMAN We have two in custody. We're still getting names. \nAllen makes his way down the hall. Custody? What happened to Lucien? \nDETECTIVE So what do we know about this Carr kid? Did we have any friends? We're gonna have to speak to all of them. \nAllen looks down and races to the hallway phone. \nINT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY \nAllen dials a number. Nervous. Edie picks up. \nALLEN Edie?

A guard opens a heavy gate and Allen walks onto the hall of cells. It's a long, dank walk. \nAllen spots Lucien in a small unremarkable cell, behind bars, reading. Allen can't believe he's here. \nLucien sits up from his cot and rushes to the bars. \nLUCIEN Allen, thank God. \nAllen's skeptical face makes Lucien change tactics. \nALLEN How could you? \nLUCIEN He wanted to hurt me, I had no choice. \nALLEN You could have run. Called the police. \nLucien looks Allen fiercely in the eye. \nLUCIEN Listen. Somehow he found me at the Marine Hall. \nAllen looks away, realizing he is potentially complicit. \nLUCIEN He said no matter where I went, he would follow. When I confronted him, he exploded.

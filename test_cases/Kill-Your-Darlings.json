{"train": "KILL YOUR DARLINGS \nWritten by \nJohn Krokidas and Austin Bunn \nStory by \nAustin Bunn \nBased on a True Story \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT \nEXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT \nUnderwater. \nShafts of eroded light slice into the depths of the Hudson River. The ghostly melody of \"Lili Marlene,\" the ache of the war-time lover, plays as a strange SHADOW drifts into view. \nWe realize it is a BODY. \nALLEN (V.O.) Some things, once you've loved them, become yours forever. \nThe body BREAKS the surface and we see the face of its owner ---- DAVID KAMMERER, 33, bearded, handsome. He is clothed, open white shirt, khakis. Dead. \nALLEN (V.O.) And if you try to let them go... \nSuddenly, a breath: he comes back to life. \nDavid floats back to LUCIEN CARR, 20, (blonde, beautiful, shirtless and terrified), waist deep in the water. \nThe scene is playing in REVERSE MOTION. \nALLEN (V.O.) They only circle back and return to you. \nDavid's body LIFTS into the young man's arms. We see David's feet and hands are TIED together with shoelaces. Stones rise back into his pockets. \nALLEN (V.O.) They become part of who you are... \nA stain of blood on David's chest shrinks, vanishes. \nDavid's eyes OPEN. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE TOMBS - DAY \nLUCIEN ...or they destroy you. \nFrom behind the bars of a jail cell, Lucien Carr (the young man from the opening) finishes reading from a paper MANUSCRIPT in his hand. \nLucien, furious, crumples it up. \nLUCIEN You can't show this to anyone. \nWe PULL BACK to reveal the author of the manuscript: a eighteen-year-old ALLEN GINSBERG. Unslept and exhausted. But determined. \nAllen stares defiantly at Lucien from the other side of the bars. \nALLEN Then tell the truth, Lu. \nLUCIEN You weren't even there. It's your truth. It's fiction. \nAllen grabs for his manuscript back, but Lucien pulls it out of reach. \nLUCIEN You wanted him gone too. You sent him to me. \nAllen reaches through the bars and SNATCHES the paper. \nLucien won't let go -- it's a tug of war between the two boys, two wills. Allen yanks the paper from Lucien's grip and wins. Lucien, panicking. \nLUCIEN (CONT'D) Please. You'll kill me with that. \nAllen turns and races towards the exit of the prison. Desperate, Lucien calls out after him. \nLUCIEN Allen! No! \nAllen doesn't turn. An alarm HAMMERS through the prison. \nNAOMI What did you say? \nAllen turns the music up all the way. Allen mimes deafness. Finally, she understands: their sounds are drowned out by the music. \nAllen reaches for her. She finally softens, takes his hand. \nAs mother and son waltz together with the music, Naomi clutches Allen to her, like he's the only thing keeping her sane. Because he is. \nNAOMI Don't ever leave me. \nAllen, trapped, over her shoulder. \nFrom the doorway, we see that Louis has been watching the whole time. \nEXT. GINSBERG FRONT PORCH - NIGHT \nOverwhelmed, Allen shakes on the front stairs. She's not well. The faint sound of jazz, fun from someone else's home from down the block. Louis comes out onto the porch, with an open LETTER in hand from the mail pile. He's upset. \nLOUIS Were you even going to tell me you applied?! \nAllen spies the \"Columbia University\" seal on the front. He's been caught. He looks down, ashamed. \nALLEN I didn't want her to know. (beat) It was a dream anyway. \nLouis lights his own cigarette. Offers his son one. He declines. \nLOUIS (talking to himself, dreaming) Trilling's there. Van Doren. English Professors. Important fellows. And New York City, right in your goddamn lap. \nLouis sits beside his son. \nLOUIS Love that is hoarded, molds at last. \nAllen, surprised to hear his Dad reciting one of his poems. \nLOUIS Until we know, the only thing we have-- \nALLEN is what we give away. \nLOUIS Is what we hand away. Have, hand. Consonance. \nALLEN Give, is. Assonance. \nLOUIS I wrote the goddamn poem. Go write your own. \nLouis hands over the letter. The hardest thing he's ever done. \nAllen takes the envelope, rips it open. He's looking at the response in shock. Louis tries to read his son's face. \nALLEN I got in. \nLOUIS You got in?! \nALLEN I got into Columbia University! \nLOUIS You got into Columbia University?! \nAllen and his father embrace. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COLUMBIA QUAD - DAY \nFirst day of college. Allen crosses the grand Ivy League campus in awe. Before him, the staggering facade of the library like the Parthenon. A troop of Navy midshipmen pass by. Wartime is on. \nINT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY \nAllen sets his bag on his bed. He notices on one wall are patriotic posters, exercise posters. He's already got a roommate. \nHe eyes a map of the New York City subway system. He can't believe he's really here in the big city. He walks over to it. \nAllen studies the map, his finger gliding down to Greenwich Village. \nLUKE (O.S.) You don't wanna go down there. \nHis roommate LUKE, 18, buzz cut, in a sweaty Columbia sweatshirt, leans over him. \nLUKE Land of the fairies. Head there and you never come back. (extending a firm hand) Luke Detweiler, Danville, Virginia. \nALLEN Allen Ginsberg. \nINT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT \nNaomi looks out the window, does not want to answer. \nNAOMI Honey, I need you come home now. \nALLEN (O.S.) Mom I can't come home. Listen, you have to look after yourself. \nNAOMI I don't feel good. \nINT. DORM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nLucien passes Allen, putting on his coat, heading out to the city. \nALLEN (whispered, to Lucien) You're going to the dance? \nLUCIEN No. Downtown. \nNAOMI (O.S.) Who are you talking to? Is he there with you?! \nALLEN No, he's not here with me. \nLucien quickly waves goodbye to Allen, heads down the staircase. Allen, torn between his mother and this boy. \nALLEN (into the phone) Listen, I'll come as soon as I can. \nINT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT \nNaomi, clutches the phone, deadly serious. \nNAOMI You need to promise. \nINT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT \nLucien slides down the stairway rail. Allen watching him disappear. \nALLEN Yes. Ipromiseloveyoubye. \nAllen hangs up on his mother and races after Lucien. \nINT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT \nAllen, breathless, storms down a flight of stairs, catches up to Lucien. Lucien turns, loving this. The puppy following his new master. \nLUCIEN Coming? \nEXT. COLUMBIA ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nLucien throws his jacket over Allen's shoulder and leads him into the wild city around the corner. \nLUCIEN Welcome to the edge of the world. \nThe sound of the IRT screeching takes us to the SUBWAY MAP from Allen's dorm room which comes to life. \nA RED LINE glides down the map from Columbia University all the way...to Greenwich Village. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STAIRS/APARTMENT, 48 MORTON STREET - NIGHT \nAllen, anxious, follows Lucien up a crowded staircase to a West Village apartment. \nThe sounds of a party spill out onto the landing and beyond. It's pure bohemia here. \nSmoke, artists flirting, arguing. Allen sees... \nA black man making out with a white woman. An older, elegant woman sharing a cigarette with a boy half her age. \nShe stares seductively at Allen. Lucien enjoying himself immensely. This is what a first time looks like. \nLUCIEN Allen in Wonderland. \nLucien grabs a DRUNK YOUNG GIRL from the crowd, kisses her passionately. Then lets her go, keeps walking. \nALLEN Do you know her?! \nLUCIEN No, and I don't plan on it. She tasted like imported sophistication and domestic cigarettes. \nINT. BATHROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT \nBILL Play nice, David. \nDAVID Allen, who comes uninvited to my apartment. \nLUCIEN Actually I invited him. \nDAVID None of us notice him. Look at him. Why would we bother? \nIn his tucked shirt and creased pants, Allen realizes the entire party is scrutinizing, judging him. \nDAVID So the pattern of our evening, our lives, holds. But under the right circumstances, even he might change the world. \nJazz music sparks, PRE-LAP from where this party's going next. Lucien eyes Allen -- an idea forming. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TAVERN - NIGHT \nThe party continuing at this underground speakeasy. Straight, gay, young, old, a subterranean zoo. A jazz signer owns the room. \nBill, David, and Allen at a table. David's moment alone with Allen. \nDAVID So you just met Lucien in the lunch line and now he's all that you can see. \nALLEN Why don't you like me? \nBILL Because David was in the same godforsaken line. \nDavid and Bill share a knowing look. Lucien returns to the table and slams a glass down. \nLUCIEN Some earjob at the bar just called me \"boy.\" So I stole his drink. \nAllen scans, sees the famous poet OGDEN NASH looking around for his glass. \nALLEN That's Ogden Nash! \nLUCIEN Who's Ogden Nash? \nALLEN The best selling poet in the country. \nBILL \"A girl who is bespectacled. She may not get her nectacled. But safety pins and bassinets--\" \nDAVID \"Await the girl who fassinets.\" \nLUCIEN And that's what he's selling?! I'll kill him. \nBill takes out a switchblade. \nBILL Aim for the throat. \nA realization. Lucien leans in, focuses his charm. \nLUCIEN No. We're not going to kill him. Even better. We're going make sure nobody remembers him. (turns to Allen) How many men started the Renaissance? \nALLEN Two. \nLUCIEN And the Romantics. \nDAVID More than I suspect this theory accommodates. \nALLEN (Five?) \nLucien's passion building. \nLUCIEN We're sending millions to fight the Fascists in Europe, but they're here! Meter and rhyme--- \nALLEN And Professor Steeves--- \nLUCIEN Yes! They're all guards in some prison. Let's make the prisoners come out and play. Let's come up with new words, new rhythms. \nAllen, swept up in the energy. He couldn't be more captivated. \nLUCIEN We need a name. \nALLEN How did they come up \"Dada\"? \nBILL Tristan Tzara jabbed a knife into a dictionary. \nLUCIEN Shit. So that's been done. \nNAOMI He already signed the papers. \nALLEN Dad?! \nLOUIS It's for the best. \nALLEN Your best. \nLOUIS It's for her best. It's not for my best. Look at her! Listen to her! \nNaomi babbling. Allen realizing how far she's gone. Allen shoves the nurse off Naomi. \nALLEN Get off! \nFrom deep within, Allen can see she is still there, and we can see she knows that it's too late. \nNAOMI This is your fault. \nThe nurse escorts a docile Naomi out of the room. Allen breaks down. Lucien, mute witness to it all. \nMUSIC PLAYS over... \nINT. GINSBERG HALLWAY - NIGHT \nLouis lectures Allen. \nWe close in on Allen's despondent face. The dutiful son's first failure. \nEXT. GINSBERG FRONT PORCH - NIGHT \nAllen escapes outside where Lucien is sitting, smoking. Allen sits beside him, notices: Lucien has been crying. \nALLEN Complicated enough? \nLUCIEN At least you have her. My father left me when I was four. \nA beat of understanding between them. Lucien lays down. Allen takes his cigarette, lays next to him. \nALLEN I've been thinking about what Yeats said. To be reborn, we have to die first. \nAllen hands him back the smoke. Lucien perks up. \nLUCIEN So what do you suggest? \nINT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nCandlelight flickers on Allen's face. \nALLEN I've spent my life making other people happy. \nWe PULL BACK to see a noose around Allen's neck. A suicide is underway. \nALLEN It's time I find happiness the only way I see possible. \nLUCIEN (O.S.) Oh please. Die already. \nWe PULL BACK again to see Lucien beside, also with a noose around his neck. Both of them on chairs. Their nooses are attached to the same pipe. \nLUCIEN Where's the verve? The brio?! \nFrom atop the chair, Lucien kicks his record player with his foot. Grand classical music screeches to a start. \nLUCIEN If it be that I am indulging my self-consciousness in justifying myself, or if it be-- \nALLEN That's a run-on. \nLUCIEN Don't edit me! \nLucien shoves Allen. Allen trips off the chair, the noose snaps tight...and suddenly he's hanging in mid-air. He struggles. Lucien tries to help, but falls off his own chair. \nThe pipe starts to bend. \nAllen and Lucien panic as they swing through the room, suspended in air. \nThe pipe BREAKS. They crash to the ground. \nA beat of relief -- are we alive? -- and the two break out into hysterics. \nDIRTY BE-BOP JAZZ PLAYS OVER... \n...a drummer takes a wild solo. Enraptured, Allen taps his fingers to these new rhythms. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY \nAllen's fingers typing in these same rhythms. Beside, The New Yorker advertising Ogden Nash's upcoming reading. \nLUCIEN (O.S.) Extraordinary men propel society forward. It is our duty to break the law. \nINT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - DAY \nAllen stopping Lucien in his tracks. \nALLEN Really? \nLUCIEN It's how we make the world wider. \nAllen considers, agrees. \nALLEN You are an extraordinary man. \nLucien beams. \nLUCIEN Well, thank you. \nINT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - AN HOUR LATER \nBill at David's bookcase, removing classic art and literature books and throwing them to Allen. \nBILL (O.S.) \"Return of the Native.\" \"Leviathan.\" Tear `em up boys. Destroy the old and build the new! \nAllen, with scissors, cuts up pages of the books. Hands them to Lucien who nails them to the wall. \nIt's a frantic assembly-line: Bill whips books to Allen, Allen tears out sections, and Lucien hammers them up. \nWe PULL BACK to see the entire wall is covered in words. \nINT. HARLEM NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT \nTime suddenly slows. The music tapers, the hands of the drummer taper down to a still. Allen looks around, scared and confused. What is happening? \nA spotlight cuts through the room, capturing the singer's sweaty ecstasy, the bassist's fingers mid-plucking. The room freezes. \nUnlit cigarette dangling from his lip, Allen turns to Bill. \nBill holds up his finger - it is on fire. He lights Allen's cigarette with the flame. We have entered into another universe. \nLucien stands -- the only thing moving -- and Allen follows. He steps into the frozen moment. And it's beautiful. \nLUCIEN Watch this. \nLucien leans over a young woman, a statue at a table with a young man in military attire. \nLUCIEN (whispered in her ear) Go. \nThe girl comes to life and clambers over the young man to a second, more attractive soldier. And kisses him. The pair erupt into life, into desire. \nLucien and Allen sit on the stage beneath the frozen musicians. Lucien pulls out a BOY SCOUT KNIFE. \nWraps Allen's hand in a fist around the blade. \nHe pulls the knife free. Allen winces in pain. \nLucien does the same to his own palm, then presses their two bloody hands together. A ceremony. Allen's eyes roll back. \nDavid appears in a janitor uniform. The Technicolor fades. \nDAVID What the hell is this? \nCUT TO: \nINT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAllen, the nitrous oxide mask over his face inhaling from a tank of gas. He has been adrift in a hallucination. \nLucien presses Allen's hand back and forth, both unharmed. \nBILL Time slows down as you drift deeper and deeper into your cave... \nAllen looks down at the \"New Vision\", ashamed. \nINT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nA rainstorm beating against the windows. Allen paces as a drunk Lucien knocks off a bottle of wine and reads from Allen's journal. \nLUCIEN \"The rose that scents the summer air/ grows from my beloved's hair...?\" \nALLEN Keep going. That's my sonnet for Steeves. \nLucien flips through the journal, closes it, disappointed. \nLUCIEN We have the map. We have the manifesto. We need the work. (suddenly cold) I was wrong. Maybe you're not up for this after all. \nAllen stares at Lucien in disbelief. Shocked, Allen rushes to Lucien's desk. \nALLEN Show me your fucking map. \nLUCIEN Stop! \nAllen grabs the pages Lucien has been working on: they are covered in doodles - there's nothing there. \nALLEN Oh right, you don't have anything because David's not here to write it for you! \nLucien stands up, drunk. Furious. \nLUCIEN It's complicated. \nALLEN I love complicated. \nLucien steadies himself. Furious. \nLUCIEN He's a professor working as a janitor so he can be near his precious Lu-Lu. He is a goddamn fruit who won't let me go. \nALLEN A fruit? \nLUCIEN A queer. \nThis detonates inside Allen. Lucien crashes to his bed. Allen sits beside. \nALLEN Then let's get rid of him. \nLucien softens, leans against Allen. Passing out from the liquor. \nLUCIEN Right now, I just need you to write us something beautiful. (beat) First thought, best thought. \nLucien drifts off. Allen shakes, holding Lucien's body for the first time. \nWe follow Allen's P.O.V. as he runs his finger through Lucien's hair. He can barely breathe, this close to what he finds beautiful. \nAllen's fingers slide to Lucien's cheek. Toward his lips. \nLucien's eyes open. Allen tenses, afraid. But Lucien suddenly takes Allen's finger in his mouth. Sucks it, eyeing Allen the whole time. \nCUT TO: \nA thunder-clap. Lucien passed out in Allen's lap. We were just in Allen's imagination. \nINT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY \nAllen at his typewriter. A blank page. Inspired to write something beautiful. \nWe see flashes of the past, snippets of Lucien: their contact, Lucien's smile. Allen searching through their past. All playing in reverse. \nLUCIEN Allen in Wonderland. \nIs it something? He writes the words down. Flash of their past build in a crescendo as he keeps searching, digging through moments, leading to... \nNOTHING. \nAllen's blocked. \nHe'll need more help if he's going to get to beautiful. \nBILL (O.S.) Pervitin. \nINT. BILL'S APARTMENT - DAY \nBill with NORMAN (30s, shady, real criminal) and Allen in his dim, bookshelf-lined lair. Bill gives the secret nod to Norman. \nA stand-off. David collects his jacket, approaches. \nDAVID Piece of advice. You don't know Lu. As soon you think you do, he'll find someone else. \nDavid smirks, walks off leaving Allen alone with his pages. \nDAVID Or maybe he already has. \nINT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT \n3:00 AM. Allen snoring. Then the sound of the door creaking open. Allen wakes up to see Lucien entering. \nLUCIEN What are you, moving in? \nALLEN Where have you been?! \nLucien starts getting undressed. \nLUCIEN I found a real writer. Already a million words under his belt before Columbia. \nALLEN You mean Jack? \nLucien fumbles. \nALLEN Why didn't you tell me? \nLUCIEN What am I supposed to do? Newsreels? \nHe spots the piece of paper in Allen's hand. \nLUCIEN What's that? \nDefensive, Allen pockets his poem for Lucien. \nALLEN Nothing. \nLucien gets into bed. \nLUCIEN If you're going to stay, don't hog the blanket. \nLucien closes his eyes. Allen sits up, jealous, his mind spinning. He stares at Lucien. \nALLEN Why is Jack a real writer? \nLUCIEN Once you meet him, you'll see what I mean. \nJACK (O.S.) Hey Al! \nINT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHandsome JACK KEROUAC (mid-20's, athletic, infamous jaw) palms a football, fakes a pass to Allen. Allen, on the couch with a stack of pages, shakes his head. \nALLEN No. \nLucien drinks wine beside. Jack ignores Allen, wings the pigskin right at him. Allen ducks. The ball SLAMS into a painting on the wall. It crashes onto Allen's head. \nEDIE (O.S.) Jack? What was that? \nJACK (with a wink) The damn cat! \nThe bell around the neck of Jack's cat KIT KAT jingles as it scurries away. Jack darts over, hangs the painting upside down. \nJACK (whispered to Allen) She painted it. Say nothing. \nJack notices a piece of mail addressed to him next to Allen. It's an old vinyl RECORD sent by his friend Sammy. He shouts down the hall. \nJACK Hey when'd this come? \nEDIE (O.S.) Today. Where is Sammy now? \nJACK I dunno. Some battleship. \nLucien nods to the huge manuscript on Allen's lap. We realize it is Jack's novel The Sea Is My Brother. \nLUCIEN What do you think? Brilliant, no? \nALLEN It's missing some periods and commas. \nLUCIEN It's better than anything you've ever written. \nThe dingy drifts into view in the middle of the busiest river in the world - quiet at this late in the night. Jack rowing. \nJACK A \"new vision?\" \nALLEN Yeah. \nJACK Sounds phony. Movements are cooked up by people who can't write about the people who can. \nLUCIEN Lu, I don't think he gets what we're trying to do. \nJACK Listen to me, this whole town's full of finks on the 30th floor, writing pure chintz. Writers, real writers, gotta be in the beds. In the trenches. In all the broken places. What're your trenches, Al? \nALLEN Allen. \nJACK Right. \nAllen looks to Lucien for help. \nLUCIEN First thought, best thought. \nALLEN Fuck you. What does that even mean?! \nJACK Good. That's one. What else? \nALLEN Fuck your one million words. \nJACK Even better. \nALLEN You don't know me. \nJACK You're right. Who is you? \nLucien loves this, raises an eyebrow. Allen pulls out his poem from his pocket. \nALLEN Be careful. You are not in wonderland I have heard the strange madness long growing in your soul. But you are fortunate. \nLucien listens anew, realizing this poem is about him. \nALLEN In your ignorance In your isolation, you who have suffered Find where love hides. Give. Share. Lose. Lest we die unbloomed. \nJust the sound of the water. Completely vulnerable, Allen sits back down. \nJACK Allen. Beautiful, kid. \nAllen looks up, moved. \nLUCIEN You wrote that? \nALLEN You asked me to. Remember? \nLucien lights up. He comes forward, gathers his friends close: gawky, emotional Allen. Blustery, sensitive Jack. \nLUCIEN Forget Columbia. Forget Ogden Nash. Here's the plan, boys. We join the Merchant Marines. Sail the world until the war ends. Then jump ship and make it to Paris. For the liberation. \nALLEN You don't speak French. \nLUCIEN Jack does. It'll be us, together. At the beginning. It'll be the perfect day. \nA FLOOD-LAMP and HORN shatter the reverie. \nA COAST GUARD patrol boat has caught them. A megaphone squawks to life. \nPOLICE OFFICER Don't MOVE! \nJACK Jesus Christ! \nPOLICE OFFICER Put your hands in the air! \nThe boys, trapped, look at each other terrified. The BLAST of the horn sends up to... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY, OUTSIDE COLUMBIA DEAN'S OFFICE - DAY \nAllen, nervous waits outside. Lucien already inside getting reprimanded by the Dean. Allen can hear the conversation through the door. \nHe leans in closer. \nDEAN (O.S.) You've managed to matriculate and drop out of Tulane, Bowdoin, University of Chicago. \nALLEN Because I don't want to be the person they think I am. I'm on academic probation. I could be kicked out. You can't leave. You started something and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do next. \nLucien, moved. \nALLEN It's our turn. Let's show them what we can do. \nAt the thought of payback, Lucien awakens. Allen grins. \nALLEN You in? \nINT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY \nA hard STAMP on a library request: RESTRICTED. \nPERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN You must not drink while you're handling it. And no writing in it. \nAllen, Lucien, Jack and Bill spy on the PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN and a female PAGE at the main desk. The librarian places a KEY RING in a drawer. \nPERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN It must come back exactly as you found it. \nThe Permissions Librarian heads off. Seeing the young page alone, Jack tucks in his shirt, SLICKS his hair down. Jabs a piece of gum from his mouth into Lucien's palm. \nJACK No telling Edie, got it? \nJack strolls up to the desk. Winks at the page. \nJACK I see you checking out all these books. And I'm asking myself: do you ever get checked out? \nShe radiates. Bill looks at his watch. \nBILL 25 seconds. Masterful. \nBut then, another page, GWENDOLYN (20, sweet and saucy), joins the first. \nLUCIEN Damn! Shift's over. \nJack looks back, shrugs as he walks off with the first page. Lucien groans, plan's 86'd. But Allen sits up. \nALLEN I'll go. \nINT. PERMISSIONS DESK, LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY \nAllen walks up to the desk. \nALLEN Hi. \nGwendolyn looks up. Allen is smiling nervously. \nALLEN I wondered if you could help me. \nGWENDOLYN Sure. \nALLEN I'm looking for a book. \nGWENDOLYN Okay. Does this book have a title? \nALLEN It's called The Day Amanda Came. \nGWENDOLYN (knowing look) Well, you'll have to wait. I can't leave the desk. \nAllen turns back to Lucien who nods, eggs him on. \nALLEN But...I really need it. \nGwendolyn looks around. \nGWENDOLYN (flirting) Okay. Only for you. \nShe places a sign on the desk: \"HELPING A READER. BACK IN 5 MINUTES.\" \nThey head off the stacks, Lucien bounds up to the desk, glides over the top, and digs through the drawer. \nOld cards. Broken pencils. NO KEYS. \nLUCIEN Shit! \n60   INT. STACKS - DAY                                           60 \nCLOSE UP: THE KEYS in Gwendolyn's hand as Allen and Gwendolyn walk through the stacks. \nGwendolyn walks off. Allen lifts his pants, ties his belt. \nALLEN I do. \nEXT. COLUMBIA LIBRARY - NIGHT \nShots of the darkened church-like building. Deserted. Timeless. \nLUCIEN (O.S.) This is it guys. Our Bastille. No chickening out. \nINT. CARD CATALOGUE AREA, LIBRARY - NIGHT \nThe light from the boys' flashlights SLICES through the dark as they enter into the library through a heavy door. \nBill reaches into Jack's mouth and takes the chewing gum from inside it. Jack shoots a glare at him - what the hell? \nBill presses the sticky gum into the strike plate of the door -- blocking the door from being able to close shut. \nThe boys look at each other, give each other the silent nod, then split -- Lucien and Jack sneak off to the main hall, Bill and Allen up to the stacks. \nBehind them, the chewing gum slips, falls from the strike plate. The door shuts. \nAnd LOCKS. \nINT. STACKS - NIGHT \nOutside a gated \"RESTRICTED ACCESS\" room, Bill grabs the padded LOCK and fits in his molded KEY. Allen watches as he turns it... \nThe lock CLICKS open. \nINT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - NIGHT \nJack and Lucien unscrew the glass from the VITRINES encasing the historic books and manuscripts we saw earlier. \nEXT. LIBRARY - NIGHT \nWalking into the light of the street lamp outside the library is David. He approaches two campus security GUARDS on the night patrol. \nDAVID Excuse me. I think I saw some light or movement in the library. \nThe security guards FLASH their lights at the facade. \nINT. RESTRICTED ACCESS ROOM - NIGHT \nBill throws open the metal gate between them and the restricted books inside. \nAn ALARM explodes into the quiet. \nBill and Allen look at each other: this was unexpected. \nINT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - NIGHT \nJack and Lucien jolt as the alarm goes off, look up from the vitrines to each other. What is going on up there? \nEXT. LIBRARY - NIGHT \nThe guards hear the alarm coming from inside the library. They race to unlock the CHAIN holding the doors locked together. \nINT. RESTRICTED ACCESS ROOM - NIGHT \nBill rushes past the gate, shines his flashlight searching the books until he finds a box marked RESTRICTED CONTENT. \nHe empties it, tossing the books to Allen. We've seen this move before. \nINT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - NIGHT \nAllen, carrying the restricted books, runs up to Jack and Lucien at the vitrines which are now wide open and empty. \nJACK (whispered) What just happened? \nJack and Lucien grab the books from Allen and start to set them in the cases. The alarm suddenly STOPS. \nSECURITY GUARD (O.S.) We know you're here! \nThe footsteps of the guards approach. Game over. Their work not done, the boys RACE back to the door they came through. \nAll EXCEPT LUCIEN. He ducks behind the vitrine, hiding. He clicks off his flashlight. \nThe guards ENTER the main hall, searching for the culprits. \nAllen blocks the library doors with his shoulder. The guards POUND on the door. \nA SOUND from outside: the padlock unlocking. Suddenly: the exit door opens. It's Jack and Bill, with lock-picking gear in hand. \nThey YANK Allen and Lucien out. \nEXT. LIBRARY - NIGHT \nJack slams the door, Bill runs the chain back through the handle and LOCKS it. \nThe door BULGES as the guards bang into it. \nSECURITY GUARD Open the goddamn door! Open this up! \nThe boys turn and RUN down the grand steps leading back to the campus. Glee on their faces. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LIBRARY - DAY \nThe same grand steps the next morning. Students walking up and down it to class, socializing, as if nothing happened there the night before. \nINT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY \nInside, the pompous TOUR GUIDE from earlier showing off the vitrines to a new crowd of parents and incoming students. \nTOUR GUIDE The South Hall library is a church, and these are the sacraments. \nThe crowd mumbles, then laughs. The guide, confused, looks inside them to see the Kama Sutra opened up to a particularly salacious page. \nThe explicit images from a Grecian urn. \nLady Chatterly's Lover, Ulysses, all the books banned, restricted, kept from public eye. \nAnd lastly: Tropic of Cancer. By Henry Miller. \nThe prisoners have come out to play. \nTOUR GUIDE Oh. My. God. \nAnd a note, left on the glass: \"The New Vision.\" \nINT. WEST END BAR - DAY \nFour shot glasses. Four hands. \nLUCIEN To literacy. \nAllen, Bill, Jack and Lucien throw back their drinks in celebration. \nThe Mills Brothers \"You Always Hurt The One You Love\" on the jukebox plays over this lazy, drunken afternoon. \nAllen's eyes scan the wall above them, Columbia's \"Hall of Fame\": newspaper headlines, yearbook photos... \nALLEN Jack, that's you, isn't it? \nHe sees a framed photo of Jack in a football play, mid-catch. \nJACK Yep. Last year. They still won. \nLUCIEN Look at them! \nAnd we do: we see FLASHES of the photos: ribbon-cuttings, team-photos, graduations: life in a thousand fake smiles and stagings. \nLUCIEN Souvenir history. To make people think they left some mark on the world. Because otherwise nobody would ever know. (beat) I don't ever want to end up on this wall. \nJACK Have no fear. You never will. \nSuddenly, David appears in the bar. The group looks at each other, mystified. \nALLEN What's he doing here? \nDavid walks briskly over to Lucien. \nDAVID Since you didn't show up earlier, I just hoped to give you this. \nDavid drops a TERM PAPER on the table: \"On the Decline of the West.\" Allen leans over the table, inserting himself into the conversation. \nALLEN Maybe he didn't want to see you. \nJack staggers from out of the barrel. Throws his hands in the air victoriously. Allen and Lucien cheer him on. \nALLEN No, he lives! \nLUCIEN Excellent! Judges award a... \nAllen holds up nine fingers. \nALLEN Nine! \nJack falls to his knees, pukes. Allen and Lucien crack up. \nLUCIEN All right Ginsy, your turn. \nDrunk, Allen tries to stand up. But then falls right back down. Lucien laughs, tucks his body next to Allen's. \nLUCIEN This is just the beginning, you know. \nLucien lays his head against Allen's shoulder. \nLUCIEN Your fault, Ginsy. It's all your fault. \nLucien's thigh brushes against Allen's. \nAllen stares at Lucien, in the full glare of Lucien's warmth. \nAllen looks around. The park is empty. Building up the courage. \nALLEN First thought, best thought. \nHe grazes his hand against Lucien's inner thigh. Lucien looks down at Allen's hand curiously, then back at Allen. \nThe decisive moment. Allen leans over. Kisses him. It builds in passion. \nLucien pulls back, unsure. Then returns the kiss. It builds in passion. \nEverything Allen had hoped for, lensed into a moment. \nJACK (O.S.) I think I just puked on the inside. \nLucien opens his eyes to notice Jack stumbling up the slope. \nHe tenses, pulls away from Allen. \nThe moment has been shattered. \nAs if nothing just happened, Lucien stands and looks at Jack with his usual devilish smile. \nLUCIEN Let's go, Jack. \nHe throws his arm around Jack's shoulder, turning his back to Allen. They start to walk off. Jack stops, turns back to Allen. \nJACK Wait, Al, you coming? \nLucien glares at Allen. \nLUCIEN No. Allen's got work to do. Ten pages on Spengler's Decline of the West. Due tomorrow. \nALLEN Excuse me? \nLUCIEN I'd be lost without you, Ginsy. (to Jack) Come on, Lion. \nThe two of them leave. Allen, abandoned and broken, puts his head in his hands. \nALLEN Fuck. Fuck! \nINT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT \nLucien and Jack stumble into Jack's apartment. Edie sits with GRANDMA FRANKIE (90s, stone-faced) around the living room table, listening to the news on the radio. We hear there's been an attack in Anzio. \nJACK Edie! Edie bird! \nLucien looks at Edie's stone-cold face. She's pissed. He turns right back around. \nLUCIEN (exiting) Lu's going to use the loo. \nEDIE Say hi to Gram. \nGrandma Frankie glares at Jack. \nAllen sits at a table at the library he just broke into and robbed. But now he's just another student sitting at a study desk. \nHe puts in a blank page in the typewriter before him and types: \"On The Decline of the West. By...\" \nHe hesitates, breaking down in tears. \nThen finishes typing: \"Lucien Carr.\" \nINT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - DAY \nLucien, in a Merchant Marine uniform, packs his clothes into a sailor's duffel bag. Allen enters, type-written pages in hand. \nALLEN Your paper and my apology. \nAllen hands Lucien the paper he wrote for him. But Lucien doesn't take it. Allen registers that he's packing. \nALLEN Where are you going? \nLUCIEN Sailing out. To Paris. \nLucien grabs his BOY-SCOUT KNIFE. Puts it in his pocket. Allen is speechless. \nLUCIEN We've got to make a ship, probably as merchant seamen. Jack knows the tricks. \nALLEN You weren't going to tell me? \nLUCIEN We both know why you can't come. \nSilence. Lucien continues his packing. Allen breaks down. \nALLEN Fuck you. You're a phony. You got me and Jack and Bill making your vision come true. All because you couldn't do it yourself. \nLUCIEN No, you got what you wanted. You were ordinary, just like every other freshman, and I made your life extraordinary. Go be you now, all by yourself. Leave me alone. \nAllen, now in tears, realizing the end is here. \nALLEN You don't really mean that. \nLUCIEN (cold, deadened) Allen. Leave. \nAllen gathers himself, stumbles out the door. Leaving the friendship behind. \nAlone, Lucien cracks, breaking down as he closes his suitcase. \nEXT. SEMINARY COURTYARD - DAY \nAllen crosses through the courtyard, heading to class. He comes upon David, waiting for Lucien. Pale. Distraught. \nDAVID Allen, have you seen him? He's not in his room. \nThey look almost the same. \nALLEN He left. \nDAVID I did something wrong. Really wrong. And you have no reason to help me. But \nALLEN But? \nDAVID I know who you are. We're the ones he needs, but never wants. It hurts, doesn't it? \nAllen burns, does not respond. David is right. \nDAVID All I am asking is tell me where he is. Please. \nCLOSE ON: Allen, on the blade of a choice. \nINT. MERCHANT MARINE, BILLETING OFFICE - EVENING \nJack and Lucien in a long line of young soldiers waiting to ship out. Lucien nips at a flask. They reach the front of the line. A BILLETING OFFICER calls out to them. \nBILLETING OFFICER Lemme see your papers. \nLUCIEN Two seamen, reporting for duty. \nJack tries not to laugh, hands over his paperwork. The officer points to Lucien. \nBILLETING OFFICER What's your name? \nLUCIEN Arthur Rimbaud. \nNorman offers the box of morphine to Bill. Bill handles it. Considering. \nEXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT \nLucien walks, guzzles from his flask. David follows. They are visibly arguing. \nSAMMY (V.O.) I can feel metal under my skin some places. Some went clean through. \nINT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJack continues to listen to Sammy, his heart sinking. He knows this is headed to a dark place. \nSAMMY (V.O.) They're not even trying to take it out no more. \nINT. CRAPPY HOTEL, 42ND STREET - NIGHT \nAllen's heart in his throat as he steps out of his pants. He is nearly naked. Vulnerable. \nEXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT \nLucien throws his flask into the woods, LASHES out at David. \nINT. BILL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nBill injects the syrette into his wrist. And presses the oblivion in. \nSAMMY (V.O.) The nurses gave me the same morphine I gave to dying boys... \nINT. CRAPPY HOTEL, 42ND STREET - NIGHT \nAllen, naked, lays on the bed. He turns off the light. \nSAMMY (V.O.) ...when I didn't know what else to do. \nThe sailor climbs on top of Allen, turns it back on. \nEXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT \nDavid LUNGES for Lucien and Lucien throws him off, spins away. \nHe pulls out his Boy Scout knife. \nDavid stares at Lucien, stunned. \nINT. CRAPPY HOTEL, 42ND STREET - NIGHT \nAllen turns to face the sailor. Looks him in the eye. \nSAMMY (V.O.) Wake, melancholy mother. Wake and weep. \nAllen reaches to kiss the sailor. \nEXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT \nLucien STABS David, plunges the blade into his chest. \nINT. CRAPPY HOTEL, 42ND STREET - NIGHT \nThe sailor enters Allen. \nINT. BILL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nBill drifts backwards, into the high. \nSAMMY (V.O.) Quench within thy burning bed, thy fiery tears. \nEXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT \nDavid looks up from his chest. Blood pumps from the gash. \nDavid, clutching his shirt, his chest... \nINT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT \nSAMMY (V.O.) And let thy loud heart keep-- \nThe record runs out, the stylus scratches. Jack, trembling. \nEDIE What is that? \nEXT. HARLEM SIDEWALK - DAWN \nLucien drops the bloody Boy Scout knife down a grate. Jack stands guard. \nLUCIEN (O.S.) I went to Jack first. He told me to get rid of the knife. To forget the whole thing. \nThey hear footsteps and turn. A black woman watches them suspiciously. \nINT. BILL'S APARTMENT - DAY \nLUCIEN (O.S.) But then I went to Bill. He told me to get a lawyer. \nBill fingering David's pack of Lucky Strikes in his bathroom. David's blood on his hand. \nLUCIEN (O.S.) To say it was an act of self- defense. \nLucien watches Bill light one of the bloody cigarettes and inhale. The last flare of his friend. \nBill flushes the rest of the pack down the toilet. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. TOMBS - DAY \nLucien, desperate, at the bars of his cell. \nLUCIEN The D.A. is asking for my deposition. In writing. \nAllen shakes his head, there's no way he's going to do this. \nLUCIEN (pleading) We both know I can't do it. I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm going to be stuck in here for the rest of my life! \nAllen, still unsure. Lucien slides his hand down the bars until it touches Allen's. Pleads seductively. \nLUCIEN Please don't leave me here. \nThe BUZZER goes off. Visiting time is over. The prison guard heads towards the cell. Allen makes a fateful choice. \nALLEN I'll do it. \nLucien, smiling. Leans in, whispers. \nLUCIEN We're going to say it was an \"honor slaying\". \nOff Allen's confused face... \nINT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY \nA finger traces down a legal index to the definition of the phrase: \"Honor Slaying.\" \nALLEN (V.O.) \"Related to a lethal attack committed when the accused is defending himself against a known homosexual.\" \nOTHER students around Allen gossip and steal glances at him as he reads to himself from the index. The murderer's \"friend.\" \nALLEN (V.O.) \"If the accused is heterosexual, he shall be pardoned. But if the accused is homosexual, the charge of murder in the first degree...\" \nAllen's attention falls to the final words: \n\"SHALL STAND.\" \nINT. POLICE OFFICE - DAY \nJack, in handcuffs, on the phone. PHOTOGRAPHERS, JOURNALISTS outside, clamoring for Jack to look their way. A murder with Columbia University students, this is big news. \nJACK Dad. It's five thousand dollars for bail. I know it's a lot-- \nA flash bulb FIRES. Journalists cat-calling for Jack's attention. \nJACK'S FATHER (O.S.) No Kerouac was ever wrapped up in a murder! Go to hell. \nThe line goes dead. Jack has run out of options. More flashbulbs EXPLODE. More screaming for his attention. Jack whips around. \nJACK Would you all just SHUT THE HELL UP?! \nINT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - DAY \nMarion Carr taking down Lucien's dorm room, packing her son's belongings into the same suitcase he tried to run away with before. \nMARION CARR You must understand David has been following him for years. \nSECRETARY He'll be with you in a minute. Please, have a seat. \nAllen waits, glances at the deposition in his lap. The title reads, \"The Night in Question.\" \nINT. JAIL - DAY \nFrom his prison bed, Lucien stares down the cellblock, hopeless. His eyes alight on his sheets. \nINT. DISTRICT'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe camera moves in an arc, rotating past Allen, sweating, toward the door of the DISTRICT ATTORNEY... \nINT. JAIL - DAY \n...the same circle finds Lucien as he RIPS the bedsheet into strips. Frantic... \nINT. DISTRICT'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe circle discovers Allen, unable to sit still. The weight of his decision crushes him... \nINT. JAIL - DAY \n...Lucien fashions a noose around his neck. He ties the sheet to one of the cell bars. We glide past him back to... \nINT. DISTRICT'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY \n...Allen spies the shadow of the District Attorney behind frosted glass of his office... \nINT. JAIL - DAY \n...the circling suddenly STOPS at Lucien as the knot on the noose catches. He is hanging, choking, desperate to die and yet fighting for life. \nBut the knot on the cell bars releases. Lucien FALLS to the ground. \nAlive. \nINT. DISTRICT'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe secretary hangs up the phone. \nSECRETARY Mr. Ginsberg. He's ready for you. \nShe looks at the chair. No one is there. \nSECRETARY Mr. Ginsberg? \nThe sound of the door closing. Allen is gone. \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) How did you expect us to react to this? \nINT. COLUMBIA DEAN'S OFFICE - DAY \nAllen's manuscript HITS the Dean's desk. \nThe deposition's title page now reads \"The Night in Question by Allen Ginsberg.\" It's been refashioned into a novella. \nAllen sits in the same chair where Lucien was reprimanded. Professor Steeves sits silently beside the Dean at his desk. \nDEAN No, please tell me. Professor Steeves says you submitted it as your final. \nAllen, nervous in the chair. \nDEAN Well, then, let me tell you. It is smutty and absurd. \nALLEN But you finished it. \nThe Dean loses his patience. \nDEAN You've taken incompletes in two classes. And you are already on academic probation. There are rules you agreed to upon admittance into this university. And you have managed to break and keep breaking them. You don't seem to have much respect for this institution. So you may either retract this fiction as your final. Or you may choose to be expelled. What will it be? \nProfessor Steeves eyes Allen. \nALLEN Fine. \nAllen stands, making his decision. \nALLEN Consider me expelled. \nAllen reaches for his manuscript. The Dean SLIDES it out of reach. \n", "test1_input": "ALLEN Allen Ginsberg. \nPROFESSOR STEEVES Ginsberg? Your father perhaps is the poet Louis Ginsberg? \nAllen nods. \nPROFESSOR STEEVES He writes rhyming, metered verse. Why do you think he chose that form? \nAll eyes on Allen. \nALLEN Because it's easier. \nThe class titters. Professor Steeves hushes them. \nPROFESSOR STEEVES This university exists because of tradition and form. Would you rather this building be built by engineers or Whitman and his boys at play? \nAllen, realizing he is trapped, unable to answer. Professor Steeves smiles victoriously and writes on the blackboard. \nPROFESSOR STEEVES There can be no creation before imitation. \nThe other students take note. Allen sighs, follows suit. From the back row, Lucien watches Allen and unsheathes a grin. \nINT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nLuke, dressed in a suit, puts on cologne. He looks back at Allen who is copying from a tome of sonnets. \nLUKE Shut the books. We're taking my brother with us to the social. He ships out tomorrow. \nALLEN I can't. You see how much I've got to do. \nLUKE He's Navy. It's catnip for the skirts. \nLuke pulls out his own waistband and sprays some cologne down the front. Allen shakes his head. Luke shrugs. \nLUKE You hymies are really all about work, huh? \nLuke slams the door behind. Allen, alone stares out the window. \nA record starts up down the hall. Clarinet, strings. Allen's ears prick up. He knows this tune. \nIt's the same BRAHMS from his mother's bedroom. \nINT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT \nAllen walks down a darkened hallway, the music leading him forward. He reaches a door with a lit transom. He knocks. \nThe unlocked door creaks open. \nINT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nA mattress lies on the floor, a phonograph on top. Candles light the room. Books for furniture. And Lucien on the floor, reading the Times and smoking. \nALLEN Brahms? \nAllen walks inside. Lucien looks up, surprised. \nLUCIEN Finally. An oasis in this wasteland. \nNervous, Allen tries to make conversation. \nALLEN How come you're not at the social? \nLUCIEN Only the most anti-social have to go to an event actually called one. Libation? \nLucien rises and grabs a wine bottle corked with a sock. Allen looks nervously towards the door. \nALLEN You drink in your room?! \nLUCIEN How does a horrible bottle of Chianti sound? \nLucien inverts two small glasses and pours. Allen stares. He doesn't break the rules. \nALLEN I don't drink. \nLUCIEN Freshman? \nALLEN Yes. \nLucien hands him his glass. \n", "test1_true": "Lucien toasts Allen's glass. \nLUCIEN To Walt Whitman, you dirty bastard. \nAllen, mortified, not sure how to take that reference as Lucien knocks his wine back in one gulp. \nLUCIEN How's your Yeats? Have you read A Vision? \nHe tosses Allen a BOOK. Dog-eared, underlined and crumbling. \nALLEN Never heard of it. \nLUCIEN It's completely brilliant and impossible. He says life is round: we're stuck on this wheel. Living. And dying. \nAllen opens the book, looks through the old pages, sees a strange symbol: a diagram of a celestial WHEEL. \nLUCIEN An endless circle. Until. Someone breaks it. You came in here, you rupture the pattern. Bang: the whole world... \nALLEN                            LUCIEN Gets wider.                      Gets wider. \nLucien looks at Allen, amazed. \nLUCIEN How did you...? \nALLEN Consonance. Reiteration of themes. \nLucien, intrigued, circles in close. \nLUCIEN Are you a writer? Because I've got a job for a writer. \nAllen, mesmerized. \nALLEN No. I'm not. \nLUCIEN Well, you're not anything yet. \nThis boy so close, the rush of contact. From down the hall... \nHALL MONITOR (O.S.) Ginsberg?! \nAllen doesn't even register his name. Lucien smirks. \nLUCIEN Isn't that you? \nHALL MONITOR (O.S.) Ginsberg?! \nAllen groans, snaps out of it. \nALLEN What?! \nHALL MONITOR (O.S.) Phone call! \nAllen reluctantly hands Lucien back the BOOK. \nALLEN I'll be back. \nINT. DORM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nThe Hall Monitor hands Allen the phone. \nALLEN Hello? \nNAOMI (O.S.) I found the wires. \nINT. HALLWAY, GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT \nNaomi grips the phone desperately. We see she has stripped the wallpaper from the wall and pulled the telephone wire out from underneath. \nNAOMI He's trying to get inside my head. \nALLEN (O.S.) Dad is not trying to get inside your head, okay? Put him on. \nNAOMI He's not home. He left. \nINT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT \nAllen, confused. Up the hallway, a door locks. \nALLEN Where'd he go? \n", "test1_id": 2727, "test2_input": "BILL (O.S.) He put stones in his pockets to weigh him down. \nLucien panics, looks around. He takes off his Merchant Marine clothes. Fully naked, he drags a bound David into the dark waters of the Hudson River. \nDavid moans and struggles but is no match for Lucien. \nBILL (O.S.) And dragged him into the Hudson River. \nALLEN (O.S.) What?! \nBILL (O.S.) David was alive, Allen, until Lucien made him drown. \nThe sound of a door slamming open brings us... \nBACK TO SCENE \nINT. BILL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMR. BURROUGHS (60s, patrician, wealthy), Bill's father enters his son's apartment, causing Bill to stop telling the story. Mr. Burroughs eyes Allen suspiciously. \nMR. BURROUGHS Who are you? Is he part of this business. \nBILL Leave him alone, Dad. \nMR. BURROUGHS I paid your bail. Don't talk to me like that. \nBill looks down, obedient. The rebel silenced by his father. \nBILL Yes, sir. \nMR. BURROUGHS The car leaves in five minutes. \nAs Mr. Burroughs exits, Bill furiously SLAMS his suitcase closed. \nBILL The libertine circle has come to an end. \nAllen looks at Bill, lost at what to do next. Bill leans in close. \nBILL Go back to the beginning. \nTHE RED LINE LEADS US, ONCE MORE, DOWN THE SUBWAY MAP FROM COLUMBIA... \nTO THE EDGE OF THE WORLD. WHERE IT ALL STARTED. \nINT. BATHROOM, DAVID'S APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY \nThe window bangs open. Allen climbs into David's apartment from the fire-escape. \nHe opens the door to the living room. Sunlight filtering into a dusty, silent apartment. \nINT. DAVID'S APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY \nIt is eerie. The place of someone who just left the world. Allen looks around, unsure what he's looking for. \nHis eyes fall on the bookshelves. Memories flood back, raveling and unraveling. \nFLASHCUT TO: \nINT. DAVID'S APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY \nBooks LEAP into Bill's hands and he places them back on the shelves. \nAllen UNSUTURES the pages of books, returning back to their original condition. \nLucien TAP nails out of the wall handing the pages back to Allen. \nAllen scouring his memories, just like when he wrote his poem earlier. \nTime runs in reverse. \nBACK TO SCENE \nINT. DAVID'S APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY \nAllen searches through the steamer trunk of the apartment. Nothing. He ruffles through the console table. Again nothing. \nHe notices David's SUITCASE. The one David packed before planning on leaving by boat with Lucien. \nAllen opens it. He digs through it, searching for some clue, any clue -- something to shed light on the past. \n", "test2_true": "It's a copy of Yeats' A VISION, covered in notes. It's David's. \nIt's the same edition of the copy that Lucien showed Allen in his room. \nFLASHCUT TO: \nINT. DAVID'S APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - NIGHT \nTime shifts into reverse -- we realize this Allen's mind at work: rummaging for details, clues, snatches of life. \nWe see the first night Allen met David -- David circling his finger around his wineglass, his speech about life as a circle,slipping through time... \nFLASHCUT TO: \nINT. DAVID'S APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY \nAllen opening the book to find the legend that Lucien once showed him, the picture of Yeats's WHEEL. \nA stack of PAPERS fall from the book. Allen rifles through them. \nAnd finds a faded pink hospital \"ADMIT\" form. \nCook County Hospital, Chicago. March 1943. \nHe scans down the page: \"Carr, Lucien. Suicide Attempt. Gas Inhalation. Admitting Person: D. Kammerer.\" \nAt the bottom, the form reads \"Next of Kin.\" \nBeside is the name: David Kammerer. \nBelow, Allen sees POSTCARDS, PHOTOS. Photos of the beach, of Lucien and David, reclining together. It's their trip to Mexico. \nIn photo, the two of them, posing for the camera together. Smiling. Looking very much like a couple in love. \nLucien's signature red CRAVAT hangs around David's neck. \nOn the backside, written by hand is: \nLUCIEN (V.O.) The perfect day. \nAllen, shocked. The puzzle pieces have fallen into place. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY, GREYSTONE - DAY \nINSERT: A photo of Lucien in The New York Times. \nThe headline: \"STUDENT IS SILENT ON SLAYING FRIEND. HELD WITHOUT BAIL. AWAITING DEPOSITION.\" \nThe sound of footsteps. \nAllen looks over the article. He's on a bench in the hallway of an old sanitarium. \nHis mother, Naomi, approaches, tentatively. The first time they have seen each other since she was taken from home. \nBoth of them scared to make the first move towards re- connection. \nNaomi steps towards her son, takes his face in her hands. Allen melts in her arms. \nEXT. GARDEN, GREYSTONE - DAY \nAllen and Naomi, in the courtyard of the hospital. Patients being led through the sanitarium's gardens by nurses behind. \nNaomi, looks remarkably more calm then the last time Allen saw her. \nNAOMI He would leave me alone in the house. I was going to die there. \nALLEN No, Mom. That's not true. \nNAOMI Yeah, I know it. \nNaomi sinks inside herself, dark thoughts returning. \nALLEN Mom, stop. \nNAOMI Hey, I'm okay now. I'm your mother. And I'm okay. \nShe notices the bags under his eyes. His weary face. \n", "test2_id": 2728, "test3_input": "NAOMI But you're not. \nAllen, a kid out of his league. \nALLEN I'm in over my head. Someone I know killed a man. And I don't know what to do.

He's my best friend. \nNAOMI Listen to me. \nNaomi pulls her son closer. With more strength than she has displayed in years. \nNAOMI The most important thing your father ever did was fail me. (beat) You understand? \nAllen, realizing what he has to do. \nINT. DORMROOM - NIGHT \nLate night. Allen, back at the typewriter where he wrote the poem for Lucien. \nHe inserts a blank page. The task before him feels huge. \nThe events of the night in question -- the night of David's murder -- ravels and unravels in his mind's eye. \nFLASHCUT TO: \nDavid, stabbed, gasping at Lucien with horror. The knife being pulled back, the wound closing back up. \nFLASHCUT TO: \nDavid, reaching for Lucien, in reverse, Lucien walking back to David, ending in an embrace. \nALLEN (V.O.) He loved you. And the truth is, once-- \nFLASHCUT TO: \nAllen turns over the old PHOTOGRAPH of David and Lucien together from David's apartment. The Perfect Day. \nALLEN (V.O.) You loved him back. \nFLASHCUT TO: \nEXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nTime now runs forward, to the inevitable. We watch Lucien and David walking once more of the night of the murder. But this time we hear their argument. Lucien, drunk, tosses his flask into the bushes. David follows him, desperate. \nDAVID Let's get out of the city. Anywhere you want. I've saved up. \nALLEN (V.O.) But this secret ate away at you. \nLUCIEN I was just a kid, you dragged me into your perverted mess! \nALLEN (V.O.) So in Chicago, you tried to kill yourself. \nDAVID How can you say that? You know that's not true. \nLucien stops short. Stares hard at David. \nDAVID I will never give up on us. \nALLEN (V.O.) He rescued you. He saved your life. \nLUCIEN You're pathetic. \nLucien walks on, but David lunges for him. They struggle. \nLucien throws David off, spins free from his grasp, pulls out his Boy Scout knife from his pocket. \nThe two men face each other. \nALLEN (V.O.) You needed him as much as he needed you. \nThe bare blade FLASHES between them. David, looking at the knife, shocked that their relationship has come to this. He looks back up at Lucien. \nDAVID Now I know how you felt. \nLUCIEN When? \n", "test3_true": "David takes a step, closing the gap between him and the knife. Daring Lucien to strike. \nDAVID Do it. \nLucien moves forward. The gap narrows. Just inches away from each other. \nDavid steps forward onto the blade. Lucien does not back off. David gasps, notices the knife deep in his chest to the hilt. \nBlood pumps from the gash. \nLucien frees the knife. Then pulls back and STABS David a second time. With malice. \nAnd again. Plunges the blade into his chest. He grinds the knife into David even further.. \nDAVID Oh my god... \nDavid DROPS, clutching his shirt, his life pulsing from his chest. \nFLASHCUT TO: \nINT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nAllen writing madly. The words come in a rush. \nALLEN (V.O.) Some things once you love them become yours forever. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RIVERSIDE PARK \nOut in the Hudson River, Lucien cradles David's dying body in his arms. David looks up at Lucien, his last moment of life. The opening shot of the film. \nALLEN (V.O.) And if you try to let them go... \nDavid's eyes CLOSE. Lucien releases David out into the current. \nALLEN (V.O.) ...they only circle back and return to you. \nDavid sinks into the depths of the Hudson, becoming just a shadow then disappearing altogether. \nALLEN (V.O.) They become part of who you are. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE TOMBS - DAY \nFrom his cell, Lucien Carr finishes reading Allen's DEPOSITION. \nLUCIEN Or they destroy you. \nWe have returned to the opening scene of the movie. Lucien crumples the paper in his hand. \nLUCIEN You can't show this to anyone. \nAllen stares at Lucien defiantly through the bars. \nALLEN Then tell the truth, Lu. \nLUCIEN You weren't even there. It's your truth. It's fiction. \nAllen grabs for the manuscript. Lucien pulls it out of reach. \nLUCIEN You wanted him gone too.

PHILLIP (O.S.) Fuck off! I'm in enough trouble. 
STEVEN C'mon Phillip, just trust me- 
PHILLIP (O.S.) FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING LIAR! Do you realize how bad you've fucked me over!! You made me an accomplice! You fucking liar! I don't want to see you. Go away! I never want to see you again! 
STEVEN Phillip don't say that. 
No response. 
STEVEN (CONT'D) Well what am I supposed to do? 
PHILLIP (O.S.) You're the lawyer, you figure it out. 
This time, it's Steven who remains silent. 
PHILLIP (O.S.) (CONT'D) Oh my God... 
THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN, revealing a SEETHING PHILLIP. 
PHILLIP (CONT'D) You're not even a lawyer?! You fucking liar! 
STEVEN Well... 
He slams the door shut again. 
PHILLIP (O.S.) What the hell's going on?! Who the hell are you!? "I Love You Phillip Morris"         Green Pages   5-23-08     98. 
STEVEN Open the door Phillip. 
PHILLIP (O.S.) No. 
Steven walks up to the door and pleads gently. 
STEVEN (quietly) Open the door. Just open the door. (beat) Open the door. Please. I just want to say one thing. Please. Just one thing. That's all. Please. 
A long silence. Steven waits longer than he should with the certainty that it will open. And eventually it does... slowly and tentatively. 
Through the screen door, their eyes are just inches apart. Steven looks into Phillip's soul. He opens his mouth and-- 
SWAT COMMANDER (O.S.) Down on the ground faggots!! 
Steven and Phillip are shocked to see a small SWAT team surrounding the front porch with automatic weapons. 
SWAT COMMANDER (CONT'D) DOWN!    DOWN!    NOW! 
And as they comply and the armed men descend-- 
173   INT. GALVESTON POLICE STATION - 1996 - DAY                     173 
Steven and Phillip sit manacled, side by side. They stare at the floor in miserable uncomfortable silence. 
STEVEN Phillip? 
PHILLIP Don't. 
STEVEN I love you. 
No response. Phillip can only sit and stew.       And stew. Until finally, he's had enough. "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages     5-23-08   99. 
PHILLIP From the moment we met, you've done nothing but lie. Our whole relationship... just lies. I'm such an asshole. You took advantage of me- just like all the rest of them. You were supposed to protect me- but you've done nothing but make a fool of me. And you expect me to love you? How can I love you? I don't even know who you are. And you know what's sad? I don't even think you know who you are. So how am I supposed to love something that don't even exist? You tell me. 
Eventually a POLICEMAN stands before Phillip. 
POLICEMAN (O.S.) Morris.     You're up. 
Before he stands up, Phillip manages a terse statement. 
PHILLIP I will never forgive you Steven. Never. 
Steven is speechless as he watches Phillip walk away- disappearing down a long corridor. 
SLOW DISSOLVE TO WHITE: 
STEVEN (V.O.) That was the last time I ever saw him. 
174   INT. TX STATE PEN, 1997 - CELL BLOCK - DAY                 174 
PHILLIP carries his belongings past a line of hulking, cat-calling convicts. 
STEVEN (V.O.) ...But I knew he was right. Phillip, Jimmy, Debbie- they've all been right. My whole life was nothing but a bunch of lies. Lies to make people love me, lies to keep them from leaving me and lies to make them give me their money. 
He enters his cell. 
175   INT. TX STATE PEN, 1997 - MICHAEL UNIT BLOCK- DAY          175 
Steven carries his belongings to his new cell in Michael Unit. "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages     5-23-08   100. 
STEVEN (V.O.) And in the process I lost track of who I was. Maybe Barbra Bascombe had me pegged right from the beginning and that's why she gave me up...

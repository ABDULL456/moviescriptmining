A POLICE CAR, lights FLASHING, sits at the curb.  A small CROWD has rathered about.  The Cabbie stands on the sidewalk gesticulating angrily to a COP. Vanity stands by the police car, obviously board, another COP by her side.  Her eyes are fastened on a good- looking BUSINESSMAN standing nearby... 
A silent negotiation seems to be going on.  Understanding wafts between them like a passing breeze. 
Without taking his eyes off her, the Businessman approaches the Cabbie, starts talking ...

(7) INT. MORRIS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
Morris moves lasciviously into the BEDROOM wearing a red muscle T-shirt, orange baggy shorts, and green knee-hi socks fastened to garters.  A yellow bandanna holds up his hair. 
The bedroom is a MESS.  A VACUUM CLEANER stands like a sentry in the middle of the floor.  He turns it on, blazes a path to his closet.  He yanks out a well- pressed suit, holds it against him, strikes a sexy, half-lidded pose only a mother could love-- 
MORRIS (awed) Oh, Lord ...

(8) EXT.  CLUB (1ST AVE.  ST.  BAR) -- NIGHT 
The STREETS are swollen with TRAFFIC. KIDS are packed onto the sidewalk, waiting to get into the club. Prince, riding his MOTORCYCLE, weaves between jammed cars, then blasts down a narrow alley leading to the rear entrance.  His guitar is slung across his back.  He chains up his bike, moves past a CROWD of KIDS, cuts inside.

(9) EXT.  STREETS #2 -- NIGHT 
A SEVILLE sweeps to a stop.  The Businessman is at the wheel. Vanity steps from the car languidly and offers a curt wave goodbye.  The car pulls away. 
She stands serenely a moment as the CAR twists around the corner.   She grabs her bag, rushes into a dark alley.  She pulls a handful of CASH from her pocket, counts through it quickly.

(10) EXT.  MORRIS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
The DOOR opens -- Morris steps confidently into the night. The change in his appearance is breathtaking. A cashmere coat is draped over his shoulders, a white scarf hangs loosely about his neck.  Wearing a sharp, gangster-style suit, his hair is a pompadour, and Stacy Adams on his feet - - Morris is the very picture of elegance.   He doesn't just walk to the curb, he slides -- his promenade punctuated with a dip at the knees you could snap your fingers to. 
JEROME is at the curb, buffing down the bumper of a yellow, 1970 Fleetwood Cadillac.  Jerome is solidly built, smooth-faced handsome with a boyish charm all his own.  He's a member of The Time, and acts as Morris' chauffeur, valet, and all-purpose shadow. 
He moves quickly to the door, holds it open as Morris settles himself into the backseat. He closes it with a flair, hops behind the wheel, pulls out.

(11) INT.  DRESSING ROOM, CLUB -- NIGHT 
Prince is BACKSTAGE, practicing spins in front of the mirror. The other MEMBERS of his CROUP are scattered throughout the room.  BOBBY sits off to the side, his drumsticks tapping against his knee. MATT puts on his doctor's smock.  LISA and WENDY finish applying their makeup. MARK runs his fingers up and down the neck of his bass guitar. 
Suddenly a STAGEHAND pokes his head into the room, holds the door open as Prince and his band cut quickly to the stage.

CUT TO: 
(12) INT.  MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT 
The DOOR opens -- A LIGHT goes on. Vanity stands in the hallway,  peers cautiously into a squalid, rundown room. She hesitates briefly, seems to sigh, then indicates she will take it.  The MANAGER closes the door as he leaves. 
She stands a moment, surveys the room. A bed and bureau, sink, a chair, hotplate -- simply the essentials. She pulls a dress from her bag, a pair of hi- heels, some gloves, underwear.  She hangs the dress on a rod, places the shoes beneath it, arranges the rest in a bureau drawer.  She looks around once more -- flowered wallpaper peels from the walls. 
She rushes to the window, tears open the shutters -- iron bars obstruct her view...

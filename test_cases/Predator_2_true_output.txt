Dillon moves a few feet into the undergrowth.  He carefully parts the thick leaves and vines and enters a tiny opening.  He looks around, seeing nothing. 
DILLON (whispering) Mac? 
Suddenly a HAND appears and covers Dillon's mouth. Dillon gasps as Mac pulls him down to where he is hiding. 
MAC (whispering; close) Out there.  Past the rocks... can you see it? 
Something seems to MOVE in the direction Mac is pointing. 
DILLON (whispering) I see it! (pause) We're gonna take this thing. 
Dillon points to an OUTCROPPING OF ROCKS, covered with VINES. 
DILLON Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him... 
MAC (a mean look) ...Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...

DILLON We both got scores to settle. 
Dillon silently disappears into the jungle, Mac watching him go. 
Mac makes his way toward the rock outcropping, working his way between the rocks and the vines.  He takes up a position and scans the jungle before him. 
121     DILLON                                               121 
moving quietly, his face intense, determined.  He stops and listens. 
122     MAC/ROCK OUTCROPPING                                 122 
straining to hear VAGUE SOUNDS coming from the jungle. He reaches out and grabs a VINE and carefully pulls himself forward into a better position. 
123     BACK TO SCENE/DILLON                                 123 
moving, searching.  He goes into a crouch. 
124     MAC/ROCK OUTCROPPING                                 124 
There is MOVEMENT in the undergrowth.  He begins to sweat.  He moves the safety to fire; reaches out and grabs another vine to pull himself forward.  Mac reacts in shock. 
The vine is alive!  Before he can move, the Hunter's HAND appears from the vines, grabbing Mac by the wrist. 
In the moment before he is killed, Mac turns and SEES the Hunter's glowing EYES. 
A FLASH as the Hunter's other hand, moves with blinding speed, Mac's face contorting in pain as the Hunter's razor-sharp SPUR rips deep into his throat. He falls forward into the leaves. 
125     DILLON                                               125 
He HEARS the faint disturbance in the leaves.  He pauses, turning in Mac's direction, listening. Hearing no further sound he relaxes, moving on. 
126     EXT. NARROW RIVER GORGE - DAY                        126 
Anna in the lead, followed by Schaefer carrying Ramirez on his back.  Billy, carrying the RADIO is covering them from above, as they skitter and slide down the loose gravel of a rocky slope, leading to a river crossing. 
127     EXT. DILLON                                          127 
He stalks through a narrow corridor of tangled vines and moss, leading to the rock outcropping on the other side, his face alert, showing no signs of fear, his weapon ready. 
128     EXT. VINES AND MOSS - DETAIL - DAY                   128 
Through the thick tangle of undergrowth, there is MOVEMENT, a slight, undulating distortion, drifting through the hanging vegetation, as if cast by a passing shadow. 
129     DILLON                                               129 
as he stops and crouches slightly, listing behind him. Did he hear something?  He moves on. 
130     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           130 
Behind Dillon and to the side of the corridor.  The Hunter syncopates him movements precisely with those of Dillon.

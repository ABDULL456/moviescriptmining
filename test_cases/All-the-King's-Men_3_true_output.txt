WILLIE Look at him! 
Duffy signals to some of his goons standing near the platform. 
DUFFY Go get him, boys... go get him. 
Sugar Boy leaps up on the platform, his pistol drawn and pointed at Duffy's men. Willie throws up his arms to silence the crowd. 
WILLIE Now, shut up! Shut up, all of you. Now, listen to me, you hicks. Yeah, you're hicks too, and they fooled you a thousand times, just like they fooled me. But this time I'm going to fool somebody. I'm going to stay in this race. I'm on my own and I'm out for blood. 
The camera moves in close on Willie's face. 
WILLIE Listen to me, you hicks...

Exterior: Willie's Speeches, Day and Night 
A series of close-ups of Willie's face as he shouts and jeers his message, always accompanied by the loud and frenzied cheers of the crowd. Superimposed over his face is the figure of Jack Burden, at his desk, typing out his stories. 
WILLIE Listen to me and lift up your eyes and look at God's blessed and unflyblown truth... And this is the truth. You're a hick. And nobody ever helped a hick but a hick himself. 
Loud cheers and yells. 
WILLIE All right, listen to me... listen to me. I was the hick they were going to use to split the hick vote. But I'm standing right here now on my hind legs... even a dog can learn to do that. Are you standing on your hind legs? Have you learned to do that much yet? Here it is, here it is, you hicks. Nail up anybody who stands in your way! Nail up Joe Harrison! Nail up McMurphy! And if they don't deliver, give me a hammer and I'll do it myself.

Exterior: Jack Burden's Desk, The Chronicle, Night 
Jack is working on a story when Madison comes to his desk. 
MADISON No use going any further, Jack. We aren't printing them any more. 
JACK I thought the Chronicle line was -- 
MADISON Divide and conquer? Stark is getting too big for his britches and the hicks are getting too smart. We're now supporting Harrison. 
JACK (stands up) How do you square that? 
MADISON I work here. 
JACK (putting on his coat) Well, I don't... not any more. 
MADISON Jack, you fool. 
JACK If you had any guts you'd print this... 
MADISON I work here. I take orders. 
JACK I know. You've got a wife and three kids and your boy goes to Princeton. 
MADISON You won't find it easy to get another job. 
JACK I'm too rich to work.

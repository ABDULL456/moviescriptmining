{"test1_input": "INT. CAFE - MIAMI HILTON - MORNING \nRyan and Natalie have a quiet breakfast. Natalie looks pretty worse for wear. \nIn the background is a TRAVELING SALESMAN rolling calls. He perks up for each message then goes back to being miserable. \nMeanwhile, after a little silent eating... \nNATALIE Last night got a little out of hand. I said things... I don't remember everything I said. I just didn't want you to think... \nRYAN Just relax. It was nice to see you cut loose. So, did you wake him up or slip out? \nNATALIE What? \nRYAN This morning... Your new friend. Did you wake him for an awkward good bye or just slip out so he could feel like a whore. \nNATALIE (NOT PROUD) I... just left. \nRYAN Protocol is always tricky. \nNATALIE I didn't know what was right. \nRYAN Sometimes there really is no right thing to do. \nThis doesn't comfort her. \nEXT. OCEAN BOARDWALK, MIAMI - DAY \nThe walkway overlooks a large MARINA filled with giant YACHTS. Ryan and Natalie are doing the photo thing with the CUT OUT of the engagement portrait again. \nNATALIE What happened to Alex? \nRYAN Had to skip town early to make a meeting. \nNATALIE That's too bad. Where does she live? \nRYAN Chicago. \nNATALIE You thinking of going to see her? \nRYAN I don't know. We just don't have that kind of relationship. \nNATALIE What kind of relationship do you have? \nRYAN It's, you know. Casual. \nNATALIE Sounds pretty special. \nRYAN It works for us. \nNATALIE Think there's any future there? \nRYAN Never thought about it. What's going on here? \nNATALIE Really never thought about it? \nRYAN (a good lie) No. \nNATALIE How can you not think about these things? How does it not even cross your mind that you might want to have a future with somebody? \nRYAN It's simple, you know that moment when you look into someone's eyes and you feel them looking right into your soul, and the whole world goes quiet for a second. \nNATALIE (finally, a break through) Yes. \nRYAN Right. Well, I don't. \nNATALIE You're an asshole. \nNatalie knocks over the CUT OUT and stands up. \nRYAN Oh come on, I'm just dicking around. I need your help... \nNATALIE Don't you think it's worth giving her a chance? \nRYAN A chance to what? \nNATALIE A chance at something real? \nRYAN Natalie, your definition of \"real\" is going to evolve as you get older... \nNATALIE Would you stop condescending for one second? Or is that one of the principles of your bullshit philosophy? \nRYAN Bullshit philosophy? \n", "test1_true": "RYAN No, it's simply a life choice. \nNATALIE It's a cocoon of self-banishment. \nRYAN Wow. Big words. \nNATALIE Screw you. \nRYAN Well, screw you too. \nNATALIE You've set up a way of life that basically makes it impossible for you to make any human connections. Now, somehow, this woman runs the gauntlet of your ridiculous \"life choice\" and comes out the other end with a smile - Just so you can call her casual. Jesus. I need to grow up? You're a twelve year old. \nNatalie begins walking away. \nRYAN I don't have a gauntlet of... \nA GUST OF WIND suddenly blows the CUTOUT across the boardwalk into the OCEAN. \nRYAN ... Fuck! \nRyan goes running after the cutout. He climbs down a GANGWAY to a dock that is closest to the CUTOUT, which is beginning to sink in the filthy water. \nRyan reaches... and reaches... and just as he's got a finger tip on the photo... FALLS IN. \nINT. BATHROOM, MIAMI HILTON - DAY \nRyan, still damp from the ocean, is drying the CUTOUT with a hair dryer. \nINT. CONCOURSE, MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY \nWe're following the CUTOUT HEADS popping out of the ROLL-AWAY like earlier, only now they are slightly faded and bent from their trip in the harbor. \nEXT.

RENTAL CAR, DETROIT HIGHWAY - DAY \nRyan and Natalie drive in silence. The weather is frigid. \nRYAN These Detroit guys can be tough. They've been getting hammered. Don't get distracted. Stick to the simple stuff. Get the packet in their hands and get them out the door. \nEXT. DETROIT CAR PART COMPANY - DAY \nA one story brick building. There's an inch of snow on the ground.

Ryan and Natalie enter, when they both see something and immediately stop short. \nSitting on the conference table is a COMPUTER set up for a VIDEO CONFERENCE. \nFramed up in a WINDOW on the screen is CRAIG GREGORY. \nCRAIG GREGORY Welcome to Detroit. \nNatalie and Ryan exchange a look. \nRYAN What's going on here? \nCRAIG GREGORY I've been getting those great numbers over the last few days. Thought we should nut up and give this a try. \nRYAN We could use a little more time. \nCRAIG GREGORY Gotta leave the nest at some point. \nRYAN This is a real company, Craig. We're here to do some damage. \nCRAIG GREGORY I know. Good thing we brought our best. So let's stop screwing around, alright? \nRyan sighs. \nRYAN Just give me a minute to prepare and get my things together. \nCRAIG GREGORY I was thinking Natalie takes this one. \n", "test1_id": 2046, "test2_input": "Alex slowly wedges herself headfirst through the window. Ryan climbs in after her. He immediately recognizes his surroundings. \nRYAN I took geography in here. (POINTING) That was my seat. \nALEX You ever fool around with one of your teachers? \nRYAN No. You? \nALEX Not until college. Come on, show me around. \nThey head for the door. \nA TEAM PHOTO OF A HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL TEAM \nA finger reaches and points to a teenage face. \nRYAN (O.C.) That's me. \nINT.

CHURCH - DAY \nKara is on her cell phone. Behind her in the deep background, we see bridesmaids consoling Julie. \nKARA Ryan, where are you? We're having a meltdown here. \nRYAN What's wrong?

ENTRY, CHURCH - DAY \nRyan immediately spots Julie sobbing and being consoled by her bride's maids. The groomsmen are huddled in another corner, embarrassed and confused. Kara splits from the brides maids and takes Ryan aside. \nRYAN What happened? \nKARA Jim's got cold feet. \nRYAN Today? \nKARA That's how cold feet work. \nRYAN What do you want me to do? \nKARA Talk to him. \nRYAN You want me to talk to him? \nKARA Hey, it's either you or me. You know my record. I've already struck out once. \nRYAN I haven't been to bat. I haven't been in the dugout. \nKARA Don't you talk for a living? Motivational type stuff? \nRYAN I tell people how to avoid commitment. \nA beat. \nKARA What kind of fucked up message is that? \nRYAN It's a philosophy. \nKARA It's stupid. \nRYAN Hey, it might have helped you. \nA beat of stalemate. \nKARA Come on, Ryan. You haven't been around much. Fuck, you basically don't exist to us. I know you want to be there for her... Well here it is. This is your chance. \nRyan takes a breath. \nINT. SUNDAY SCHOOL ROOM, CHURCH - DAY \nRyan quietly steps in to find Jim, half dressed in a tux reading the children's book \"The Velveteen Rabbit\". Jim sniffles. Ryan goes to leave, when... \nJIM Ryan? \nRYAN Oh, hey Jim. \nJIM You ever read this? \nRYAN Yeah, it's pretty powerful stuff. \nJIM I'll say. \nRYAN Kara mentioned you were having some... thoughts? \nJim puts down the book. \nJIM I don't think I can do this. \nRYAN Okay. What makes you say that today? \nJIM I was just laying there last night in bed and I couldn't sleep. I was thinking about the wedding and the ceremony and all. Us buying a house and moving in together. Having a kid... Having another kid... (begins to snowball) ... Thanksgiving, Christmas, spring break, football games, all of a sudden they're out of school, getting jobs, getting married, And then, you know... I'm a grandparent. I'm retired. Before you know it - I'm dead... and I just kept thinking... \"What's the point?\" \nRyan gulps. Fuck. \nJIM (CONT'D) (now asking Ryan directly) I mean what is the point? \nRYAN The point? \nJIM Yeah, I mean, what am I starting here? \nRYAN (DANCING) It's marriage... it's the most beautiful thing on Earth... you know, what everyone aspires to... \nJIM You never got married. \nRYAN That's true... \nJIM You never even tried. \n", "test2_id": 2047, "test3_input": "RYAN Well, it's hard to define \"try\". \nJIM You seem happier than most of my married friends. \nRyan takes a beat. \nRYAN Jim, I'm not going to lie. Marriage can be a pain in the ass. And you're kind of right - All of this is just stuff on the way to your eventual demise. \nCUT TO: \nKARA EAVESDROPPING AT THE DOOR WITH A LOOK OF COLD FEAR \nBACK TO: \nRYAN (CONT'D) We are all on running clocks that cannot be slowed down or paused and they all lead to the same place. Some guys leave marks that last beyond their own mortality. Not guys like you and me... But some. But even those footprints disappear. (A BEAT) There isn't a \"point\". \nJim sinks a little. \nRYAN (CONT'D) I'm not the guy you'd normally want to talk to about all this stuff... But think about it - your favorite memories. The greatest moments of your life? Were you alone? \nJIM (thinks about it) No... I guess not. \nRYAN I don't want to sound like a Hallmark card, but... Life? It's better with company. \nJim nods. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Come to think of it... Last night, the night before your wedding, when all this shit was circling through your head... Weren't you two sleeping in separate rooms? \nJIM Yeah, Julie went back to the apartment and I was all alone in that big honeymoon suite... \nJim chuckles to himself. \nRYAN Kind of lonely? \nJIM Yeah. \nRYAN Hey. Everybody needs a copilot. \nThis resonates with Jim and he can't help but smile. \nJIM That's a nice touch. \nRYAN Thanks. \nJIM What's the mood like out there? \nRYAN It's not good... Emotional. \nJIM What should I do? \nRYAN (twinkle in his eye) Go get her. \nINT. ENTRY, CHURCH \nJim walks over to the huddle of bride's maids. They part and let him in. He kneels at Julie's feet... \nJIM I'm sorry I'm such a fuck up... Will you be my co-pilot? \nJulie gives him a perplexed look before smiling and falling into his arms. Tears and smiles spread amongst the girls. \nKara walks over to Ryan and pats him on the shoulder. \nKARA Welcome home. \nMONTAGE BEGINS AS A SERIES OF IMAGES: \n- Ryan and Alex getting dressed in a little kitchen in the church. They're in a hurry and a little sloppy, but there's a crooked joy in their faces. \n- Jim standing at the alter with the priest getting a pat on the back from his best man. \n- Julie getting walked to the alter by Jim's uncle.

The other sign reads CHICAGO. \nALEX When am I going to see you? \nRYAN You're just going to have to come and visit. \nALEX So settled down. You're not going to change on me... \nRYAN Same guy. Just one address. \nWe hear a boarding announcement for Chicago. Alex begins to step away to her gate. \nALEX Call me if you get lonely. \nA beat. And then... \nRYAN ... I'm lonely. \nAlex turns for her gate and joins the crowd. Ryan goes to say something. He has an impulse... but he finally ignores it and gets in line under the sign that reads \"OMAHA\". \nCUT TO: \nINT. RYAN'S APARTMENT, OMAHA - EARLY EVENING \nThe door opens and Ryan wheels in his Roll-Away.

CTC HEADQUARTERS, CTC - DAY \nNatalie is giving Ryan a tour of the new ONLINE FIRING AREA - A series of cubicles with YOUNG GUYS ON HEADSETS. She is in her element and very proud of her work. \nNATALIE ... Some guy sits down in a conference room somewhere and a server routes their session to one of our termination engineers. \nRYAN You don't actually call them that. \nNATALIE I prefer \"terminators\", but it bumped with legal. \nRYAN Really? I can't imagine why. \nNATALIE They follow a workflow that can take them through anything from a standard dismissal to a violent aggressor. \nRYAN Are they actually on line, right now? \nNATALIE No, they're beta-testing. Role-playing. We go live at the end of the month. (catches one of the guys making a mistake) Kyle, you're running through the events too quickly. You have to give them time to acknowledge each statement. Okay? It's a legal thing. \nRyan can only watch. \nINT. RYAN'S OFFICE, CTC - DAY \nRyan is sitting at his desk. He puts on a HEADSET. \nRYAN This is ridiculous. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM, CTC - ANOTHER DAY \nCraig is leading a meeting. Ryan seems focused on something on his laptop.

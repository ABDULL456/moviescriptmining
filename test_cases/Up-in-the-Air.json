{"train": "UP IN THE AIR \nWritten by \nJason Reitman & Sheldon Turner \nSecure your own mask before assisting others. \n- Common Pre-Flight Instruction \nA SPOTLIGHT reveals RYAN BINGHAM standing at a PODIUM. \nHe unzips a BACKPACK and sets it down beside him. \nRYAN How much does your life weigh? \nRyan pauses to let us consider this. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack... I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders... You feel them? (gives us a beat) Now, I want you to pack it with all the stuff you have in your life. Start with the little things. The stuff in drawers and on shelves. The collectables and knick-knacks. Feel the weight as it adds up. Now, start adding the larger stuff. Your clothes, table top appliances, lamps, linens, your TV. That backpack should be getting pretty heavy at this point - Go Bigger. Your couch, your bed, your kitchen table. Stuff it all in... Your car, get it in there... Your home, whether you have a studio apartment or a two story house, I want you to stuff it into that backpack. \nRyan takes a beat to let the weight sink in. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Now try to walk. \nWe hear people around us chuckling. Ryan smiles. Reveal: \nINT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON \nThe kind that shifts between lower income corporate retreats and lower income weddings. \nThe few dozen people seem to be visualizing as told. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Kinda hard, isn't it? This is what we do to ourselves on a daily basis. We weigh ourselves down until we can't even move. And make no mistake - Moving is living. \nWe see nodding. People's gears turning. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Now, I'm going to set your backpack on fire. What do you want to take out of it? Photos? Photos are for people who can't remember. Drink some gingko and let the photos burn. In fact let everything burn and imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing. (a beat of emphasis) It's kind of exhilarating isn't it? That is how I approach every day. \nA titter through the crowd. \nINT. BOEING 757 - DAY \nA FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT is looking directly at us. \nFEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT Do you want the cancer? \nTurn to see RYAN looking back. \nHandsome. Anonymous. Right now - Confused. \nRYAN Excuse me? \nFEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT (SAME DELIVERY) Do you want the cancer? \nRyan furrows - What the hell is going on here? \nThe flight attendant raises her hand to reveal a CAN OF SODA. \nFEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT The can, sir? \nRYAN Oh... No. Um, no thank you. \nThe flight attendant moves to the next aisle. Ryan takes a beat, then returns to his work. \nINT. SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM, SUN CASUALTY - DAY \nTwo words - Subordinate chic. \nSeated at a tiny table is RYAN. The Grim Reaper in a suit. \nWe see a series of REAL PEOPLE react to the news of being fired. They should be non-actors (actual victims of recent layoffs) that can react organically to the news with authenticity. Some are hurt. Others are upset and even abusive. The series concludes with... \nSTEVE (AN ACTOR) \n... who's on the verge of tears. \nSTEVE Who the fuck are you? \nFREEZE on Ryan. \nRYAN (V.O.) Excellent question. Who the fuck am I? Poor Steve has worked here for seven years. \nFLASH IMAGES: \nReveal - A man next to Ryan. Some BUSINESSMAN between cities. He talks, drink in hand, but we don't hear him. \nRYAN (V.O.) We start chatting, impersonally at first. Our moderate politics, our sinking opinions on the American service industry. \nBUSINESSMAN AND RYAN MAKING SUGGESTIONS \nRYAN (V.O.) You recommend a hotel in Tulsa. I tip you off to a rib joint in Fort Worth. \nBUSINESSMAN TELLS A JOKE. HIS HANDS GESTURE. \nRYAN (V.O.) You tell me your best joke. I've heard it before, but listen anyway. \nRyan laughs out loud. \nTURBULENCE. THE BUSINESSMAN TIGHTENS HIS SEAT BELT. \nRYAN (V.O.) Nothing like turbulence to cement a bond. Soon you're telling me about family. \nTHE MAN SPEAKS ABOUT SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY DISTURBS HIM. \nRYAN (V.O.) Your wife just went back to work but you can't intervene because you sure could use the extra paycheck and besides, last June she read some book and woke up one morning a feminist. \nTHE MAN LEANS BACK, ARMS CROSSED, WITH A FAR OFF LOOK. \nRYAN (V.O.) And that if your windfall ever came through, you'd quit and spend the rest of your days restoring vintage speedboats. (saying it with him) The water. That's where you belong. \nEXT. TARMAC, DALLAS FORT WORTH AIRPORT - DAY \nTheir PLANE LANDS. \nINT. BOEING 757 - DAY \nAs the plane begins to taxi to the gate, both Ryan and the Businessman pull out their cards. \nRYAN (V.O.) We exchange cards and slot them next to countless others. \nThe dull bell \"dings\" to let us know it's safe to stand. Ryan and the Businessman get up and open the overheads. \nRYAN (V.O.) Fast friends aren't my only friends, but my best friends. \nINT. CONCOURSE, DALLAS FORT WORTH AIRPORT - DAY \nRyan and the Businessman walk next to each, now completely ignoring each other as if they never shared a word. \nRYAN (V.O.) Sad? Not really. We're a busy bunch. I'm peaceful. I'm in my element here. I suppose I'm a sort of mutation, a new species. I live between the margins of my itineraries. \nRyan and the Businessman reach a point that separates - CONNECTING FLIGHTS go left / LONG TERM PARKING goes right. \nThey share an awkward smile with a nod, then head in their separate directions. \nINT. BROOKS BROTHERS, DALLAS FORT WORTH AIRPORT - DAY \nRyan is checking out TIES when his cell phone rings. He checks the I.D.- UNAVAILABLE. He weighs it for a second. \nRYAN (PICKS UP) Hello? \nKARA (O.C.) Hi Ryan. \nRyan mouths a silent \"fuck\". \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. KARA'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nKara is Ryan's sister. Her home overflows with books, photos, family collectables, and kid's artwork. \nRYAN (V.O.) Every family has one person who is the glue. The one who keeps the genealogy in check. That's my sister Kara - The glue. \nIt just so happens that Kara is GLUING her daughter's school project mobile together. \nRYAN Hey Kara. \nKARA How are you holding up? \nRYAN Just fine. You? The kids? \nKARA (LYING) Missy's outstanding. Matthew made varsity. How's the road? \nRyan exits the store and we realize we are in... \nINT. CONCOURSE, DALLAS FORT WORTH AIRPORT - DAY \nRyan hops onto a PEOPLE MOVER. \nINT. BAR LOUNGE - HOUSTON HILTON - LATER THAT EVENING \nEmpty glasses litter the table. Ryan and Alex have taken over a couch and have the contents of their wallets spread out - All MEMBERSHIP CARDS. \nRYAN (grabs one of Alex's cards) Maplewood Card? How dare you bring that into this palace. \nALEX Hilton offers equal value and better food - But the Maplewood gives out warm cookies at check in. \nRYAN They got you with the cookies? \nALEX I'm a sucker for simulated hospitality. \nRYAN There's actually an industry term for that. It's a mixture of faux and homey. It's faumey. \nAlex grabs Ryan's AMERICAN CONCIERGE KEY CARD. \nALEX Oh my God. I've heard about these, but never seen one in person. Is this a...? \nRYAN Concierge Key. Yeah. \nALEX I love the weight. \nRYAN Graphite. I was pretty excited the day that puppy came in. \nALEX I'll say. I put up pretty pedestrian numbers. Sixty thou a year, domestic. \nRYAN (TRYING) That's not bad. \nALEX Don't patronize me. What's your total? \nRYAN That's a personal question. \nALEX Oh please... \nRYAN (PLAYFUL) I hardly know you. \nALEX Show some hubris. Impress me. (SUGGESTIVE) I bet it's huge. \nRYAN You have no idea. \nALEX Come on... (holds her hands eight INCHES APART) Is it this big? (extends a few inches) ... this big? \nRYAN Let's just say I've got a number in mind and I haven't hit it yet. \nAlex smiles, fair enough. Admires the CONCIERGE KEY CARD. \nALEX This is pretty fucking sexy. \nRYAN I hope it doesn't cheapen our relationship. \nALEX We're two people who get turned on by elite status. We may have to settle for cheap. \nRYAN There's nothing cheap about loyalty. \nAlex looks into Ryan's eyes and gives him unspoken permission to take her right there and then. \nINT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT \nRyan and Alex walk down a curved corridor, suppressing laughter. There's no adult way to go back to somebody's hotel room. Once at the door, Ryan tries his KEY CARD, but it doesn't work. \nHe reaches into his pocket and comes up with five other key cards from recent trips. \nRYAN I really have to start throwing these out. \nHe tries a couple. \nALEX We can always use that room with the ice machine. \nRyan chuckles. He finds the right key and opens the door. \nINT. RYAN'S SUITE, HOUSTON HILTON - LATER THAT NIGHT \nEverything is scattered from a marathon Fuck. Ryan and Alex are laying on the bed, sprawled out on their backs like murder victims. \nRYAN Good call on the towel rack. \nALEX Thanks. I liked how you burritoed me in the sofa cushions. \nRYAN I was improvising. \nALEX Too bad we didn't make it to the closet. \nRYAN We got to do this again. \nRYAN It's fine. Really. I'll go with the majority. \nNOSEY NEIGHBOR Sometimes I forget that you even live here. You could probably save money and move into a hotel. \nRYAN (DEAD SERIOUS) I looked into it, but the IRS requires a permanent address for employment. Otherwise, they classify you as a vagrant. \nDing! - Ryan gets off at his floor. \nNOSEY NEIGHBOR Oh. \nINT. RYAN'S APARTMENT, OMAHA - DAY \nRyan walks in and sets his bag down. Reveal - the place is empty... Like empty, empty. \nRyan opens the fridge - Chinese take out. Pizza box. Bottle of Vodka. Takes a whiff of something - not good. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Hey neighbor. \nRyan turns to find Dianne, a pretty woman just shy of forty. \nRYAN Hey yourself. \nThey hug - It's just intimate enough to know they've violated the rules of sleeping with your neighbors. \nDIANNE (hands over a package) I signed for this while you were gone. \nRYAN Thanks. Hope it wasn't a bother. \nRyan opens it and finds the CUT-OUT of his sister Julie and her fiance Jim. It's an eighteen inch card stock photo of Jim hugging Julie from behind. \nDIANNE (RE: PHOTO) They seem happy. \nRYAN It's my sister. She's getting married. Haven't met the guy yet. \nDIANNE Lots of luck. \nRYAN I know, right? \nThey share a smile. Then, Dianne goes to leave. \nDIANNE It's good to see you. Feels like a while this time. \nRYAN Hey, you want to come over tonight? \nDianne gets a little uncomfortable. \nDIANNE Actually, I kind of started seeing somebody. \nRYAN Oh, that's... that's great. \nDIANNE Yeah, we're having drinks tonight if you want to come over. \nRYAN That's okay... I' think I'll settle in. \nDianne gives a smile/nod and exits. Ryan take another long look at the CUT-OUT. He shakes his head. \nEXT. CTC HEADQUARTERS, CTC - MORNING \nA downtown midsize high rise. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nThe company has piled in, standing room only. Assistants and interns watch through the windows. \nCraig addresses the group including his own superiors. \nCRAIG GREGORY Just thrilled to have everyone under one roof. Welcome home boys. \nA couple odd looks from road warriors a decade his senior. \nCRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D) I know there's are lot of whispering about why we're all here. (MORE) \nCRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D) Retailers are down twenty percent. Auto industry is in the dump. Housing market doesn't have a heartbeat. This is our moment. It's one of the worst times on record for America... and I don't want to be standing here two years from now, wondering how we missed this window of opportunity. \nA strangely encouraged response from the group. \nCRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D) Now, last Summer we received a dynamite young woman by way of Cornell. She challenged us with some big ideas. My first reaction was, who does this kid think she is? But when I started to give a listen, I was pretty knocked out. So now, with a little peek into our future - Natalie Keener. \nNatalie stands up. \nNATALIE If there's one word I want to leave you with today, it's this... \nNatalie clicks on her POWER POINT PRESENTATION. \nCRAIG GREGORY Ryan, Coke and IBM have been doing it for years. Just like anything, there's a few months of transition, but everyone settles in. \nRYAN Who are you taking off the road? \nA beat. \nCRAIG GREGORY You don't get it. You're grounded, Ryan. Everyone is. It's done. \nRYAN Okay, what we do here is brutal and leaves people devastated, but there's a dignity to the way I do it. \nCRAIG GREGORY Stabbing people in the chest instead of the back? \nRyan rolls his eyes. \nCraig's door opens and Natalie pops her head in. \nNATALIE You wanted to see me? \nCraig goes to wave her off. \nRYAN Yeah, why don't you come in. \nNatalie is confused but takes the chair next to Ryan. \nCRAIG GREGORY Great job in there, Nat. \nNATALIE Thank you. How's everyone taking it? \nNatalie and Ryan hold a look for a second. \nRYAN (TO NATALIE) Look, I appreciate your... zeal. And you have some good ideas. But you know nothing of the realities of my job. Sure, you can set up an iChat... but you don't know how people think. \nNATALIE Actually, I minored in psychology. \nCRAIG GREGORY Nice. \nRYAN (TO NATALIE) Okay kiddo, fire me. \nCRAIG GREGORY Ryan, stop it. \nRYAN She's going to be doing this on a regular basis. You don't want to know if she can fire somebody? \nCRAIG GREGORY She just fired Ned. \nRYAN My dog could fire Ned. (TO NATALIE) Fire me. \nCRAIG GREGORY Ryan. \nNATALIE It's okay, I got this. \nRyan and Natalie turn to face each other. \nNATALIE (CONT'D) Mr. Bingham, I regret to inform you that your position is no longer available. \nRYAN Who the hell are you? \nNATALIE My name is Miss Keener and I'm here today to discuss your future. \nRYAN My future? I don't know you. The only person who can fire me is Craig Gregory. \nNATALIE Mr. Gregory hired me to handle this for him. \nRYAN Handle what? Handle me? Mr. Gregory hired me and he's the only one who can fire me. I'm going to talk to him. \nRyan gets up. Natalie gets up too. \nNATALIE Mr. Bingham... \nRYAN You can't follow me... You're on a computer screen. Remember? \nNATALIE (FRUSTRATED) Ryan... \nRyan sits back down. \nRYAN Try again. Fire me. \nNATALIE I just did. \nRYAN Actually, you didn't. Now, fire me. \nCRAIG GREGORY Stop it, Ryan. \nNATALIE (IGNORES CRAIG) Mr. Bingham, I'm here today to inform you that your position is no longer available. \nRyan is packing his ROLL-AWAY BAG. It is practiced and systematic. He's just about finished, when he notices the CUT- OUT of his sister's engagement photo. \nHe tries placing it in the open bag, but it is immediately clear that the photo is two inches to long. He tries putting it on an angle, but that doesn't help. \nRYAN Huh. \nRyan centers the cut-out again and tries to ZIP around it, but he can't get the zipper around the HEADS of the photo. For a moment, it almost seems like he's assaulting their tiny head with the zipper handle. Doesn't help. \nA moment of silent frustration. \nCUT TO: \nTHE ROLL-AWAY \nBeing pulled through an airport. The little heads of Ryan's sister and her fiance are poking out the top of the bag. The two zippers have been closed on either side of them as though they were tiny passengers peeking out the sunroof. \nINT. EPPLEY AIRFIELD, OMAHA - MORNING \nRyan cuts right through the crowd, wheeling his carry-on towards the automatic check-in machines. \nRyan stops when he notices NATALIE saying goodbye to her BOYFRIEND - a kind of Hollister looking guy in his mid- twenties. He's not thrilled by the public affection. After a beat, they break and he exits. \nNatalie sees Ryan and starts dragging her LARGE SUITCASE towards him. The SCRAPING against the terrazzo sends a shiver up Ryan's spine. \nShe arrives and sets the heavy bag down with a CLUNK. Ryan stares at her travel case for a beat then up to her. \nNATALIE What? \nCUT TO: \nA ROW OF ROLL AWAY BAGS \nINT. LUGGAGE STORE, EPPLEY AIRFIELD - MORNING \nRyan pulls one out and tests the action. \nNATALIE I really like my luggage. \nRYAN That's exactly what it is. Luggage. (off of Natalie's look) You know how much time you lose by checking in? \nNATALIE I don't know, maybe five minutes waiting for... \nRYAN Thirty five minutes per flight. I travel two hundred seventy days a year. That makes one hundred fifty seven hours... That's Seven Days. (points to her luggage) You ready to throw away a whole week on that? \nINT. TERMINAL FLOOR, EPPLEY AIRFIELD - MORNING \nNatalie is attempting to repack her new bag in the middle of the airport. Ryan helps by throwing a couple things out. \nINT. SECURITY, EPPLEY AIRFIELD- MORNING \nRyan spots various \"bad lines\", then sees a group of Asians. \nRYAN Bingo. Asians. \nRyan starts walking. \nNATALIE You can't be serious. \nAs they pass the first line - A FAMILY OF SIX. \nRYAN Never get behind people travelling with infants. I've never seen a stroller collapse in less than twenty minutes. \nSecond Line - AN ELDERLY COUPLE \nRYAN (CONT'D) Old people are worse. Their bodies are littered with hidden metal and they never seem to appreciate how little time they have left on Earth. \nThird Line - A COUPLE MIDDLE EASTERN GUYS. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Five words. Randomly selected for additional screening. \nThey enter the fourth line behind the Asians. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Asians. They're light packers, treasure efficiency, and have a thing for slip-on shoes. God love'em. \nNATALIE That's racist. \nRYAN I'm like my mother. I stereotype. It's faster. \nINT. SECURITY, EPPLEY AIRFIELD MOMENTS LATER \nRyan is just fastening his belt, having just gone through security, when we hear a beeping go off. Natalie is trying to find the metal on her body that has set off the machine. She also has forgotten to take her laptop out of her bag. It's a mess. \nINT. BOEING 757 - MID FLIGHT \nDing - The elevator door opens. \nINT. RECEPTION, BOTTLING COMPANY - DAY \nRyan and Natalie enter the door to find a reception desk on an empty floor. Scattered telephones sit on the ground where desks used to be. A few desks in one corner are still manned. \nNatalie tries not to show: It's all becoming very real. \nRYAN (to desk girl) Ryan Bingham, from CTC. \nThe desk girl looks up from her work. She knows who they are. \nINT. CUBICLE CITY, BOTTLING COMPANY - DAY \nRyan and Natalie pass rows of cubicles. Heads begin to pop up to see their arrival. Natalie accidentally makes eye contact with one guy, then quickly shifts her gaze forward. \nINT. WINDOWLESS CONFERENCE ROOM, BOTTLING COMPANY - DAY \nRyan and Natalie sit next to each other at a polyurethane conference table. \nRYAN All you have to do today is watch and listen. When I talk about the strategy packet. You hand them one of these... \nRyan points to a stack of packets. \nNATALIE You ever find it strange that termination comes with a packet. \nRYAN Everything important in life comes with a packet. \nMONTAGE OF MORE REAL PEOPLE REACTING TO BEING FIRED \nA SERIES OF REAL PEOPLE sit down across from Ryan and Natalie \nRYAN Thank you for coming by. As you're probably well aware, this is a tough economic climate and your company is not immune. \nREAL PEOPLE tighten up as they begin to catch on. \nRYAN While I wish I was here with better news, the reason you and I are meeting is this is your final week of employment here. \nREAL PEOPLE blame all sorts of people and situations that they personally hold responsible. \nRYAN This is not a time to look for blame. Your position simply no longer exists. \nREAL PEOPLE respond further. Some are enraged. Some are polite. One is even grateful. \nRYAN I understand why you are saying these things. (MORE) \nRYAN (CONT'D) It's perfectly natural to feel this way. I want you to take the next week to explore this strategy packet... \nRyan nods to Natalie who we now see begrudgingly HANDING PACKETS to all of the REAL PEOPLE we've already met. \nRYAN Fill out the skill set work sheet... Use the hopes and dreams diagram... And the tree of aspirations. \nWe SEE the \"TREE OF ASPIRATIONS\" sheet. \nRYAN (WITH EMPHASIS) The answers are all in there. \nWe see more packets getting handed out as Ryan repeats... \nRYAN The answers are all in there. (ANOTHER PERSON) The answers... (ANOTHER PERSON) The answers... (ANOTHER PERSON) ... are-all-in-there. \nCUT TO: \nBOB (AN ACTOR) PRESENTING A PHOTO OF HIS CHILDREN \nBOB And what do you suggest I tell them? \nBOB. Dry red eyes from tears of rage stare down the lens. \nNatalie can't hold back any longer. \nNATALIE (A SUGGESTION) Perhaps you're underestimating the positive effect your career transition may have on your children. \nRyan looks at Natalie like she's out of her mind. \nBOB Positive effect? \nNATALIE Well, tests have shown that children under moderate trauma have a tendency to apply themselves academically as a method of coping. \nBOB Go fuck yourself. That's what my kids'll think. \nNatalie shrinks. Ryan immediately covers. \nRYAN Your children's admiration is important to you? \nINT. RESTAURANT BAR, ST. LOUIS HILTON - EVENING \nNatalie sits back down at the table a little visibly shaken. \nRYAN You okay? \nNATALIE (COVERS QUICKLY) Yeah. Fine. \nJust then, their food arrives... And there's a lot of food. Natalie's eyes move back and forth trying to figure out why there seems to be three main courses and a bunch of sides. \nNATALIE Hungry, much? \nRYAN Our expense account allots for forty dollars each on dinner. I plan on grabbing every mile I can. \nNATALIE Okay, you got to fill me in on this mile business. What's that all about? Are you talking like frequent flier miles? \nRyan gives Natalie a look - Is she ready for this information? \nRYAN Your really want to know? \nNATALIE (MOCK SERIOUS) I'm dying to know. \nRYAN I don't spend a nickel, if I can help it, unless it somehow profits my mileage account. I'm not talking hotel rooms and rental cars either, but internet services, cell phone, music downloads, teleflorists. The works. I shop them according to the miles they pay and I pit them against each other for the most value. \nNATALIE So, what are you saving up for? Hawaii? South of France? \nRYAN No, it's not like that... The miles are the goal. \nNATALIE That's it? You're saving to save? \nRYAN Let's just say I've got a number in mind and haven't hit it yet. \nNATALIE Wow. Seems a little abstract. What's your target? \nRYAN I'd rather not. \nNATALIE (TEASING) It's a secret target? \nRYAN It's ten million miles. \nNATALIE Huh. Isn't ten million just a number? \nRYAN Pi is just a number. \nNATALIE I guess we all need a hobby. \nRyan looks back at Natalie - Hobby? \nNATALIE (CONT'D) Oh hey, I didn't mean to belittle your collection. I get it. Sounds cool. \nRYAN I'd be the seventh person to do it. More people have walked on the moon. \nNATALIE Do they give you a parade or something? \nRYAN Lifetime Exec Platinum status. You get to meet the Chief Pilot, Maynard Finch. And... They put your name on the side of a plane. \nNATALIE Men get such a hard-on from putting their name on stuff... You guys don't grow up - You just need to pee on everything. \nRYAN Now, who's stereotyping? \nNANCY Fear of mortality. It's like Yes, you're going to die one day. \nRYAN And why do you suppose that's singular to men? \nNATALIE Probably cause you can't have babies. \nRyan can't help but laugh a little. \nNATALIE (CONT'D) If I had that many miles, I'd just show up at the airport, look up at one of those big destination boards, pick a place and go. \nThis idea sinks in for a second with both of them. \nINT. RYAN'S ROOM, ST. LOUIS HILTON - NIGHT \nRyan is laying in bed wearing a Hilton bathrobe. He's reviewing his sister's wedding invite when his BLACKBERRY BUZZES on the night stand. He reaches over to check it. It's a text message: \nAlex: \"Can't fall asleep.\" \nRyan types back: \nRyan: \"Me too. Just laying here.\" \nINTERCUT WITH: \nKAREN You don't have to sugar coat it. I get the drill. What are they offering? \nNATALIE Inside the packet you'll find a clearly worked out severance package. \nKAREN Give me the bullet points. \nNATALIE Three months pay. Six months medical. A full year of placement services through our company, CTC. \nKAREN Placement services? How generous. \nNATALIE Commonly, it takes one month of searching for every ten thousand dollars you expect to earn in salary. \nKAREN So I could be looking for a while. \nNATALIE Not necessarily... \nKAREN Oh, don't sweat it. I'm pretty confident about my plans. \nNATALIE (SPIRITS LIFTED) Oh yeah? \nKAREN Yeah. Can you tell me? Is high tide in the morning or the evening? \nNATALIE I don't know. Why? \nKAREN There's this beautiful bridge by my apartment. I need to figure out what time to jump off it. \nNatalie begins to tremble. \nEXT. WICHITA SECURITIES COMPANY COURTYARD - DAY \nNatalie bursts out the doors and sits on a bench. She's freaked out. Ryan is five steps behind her. He puts a hand on her shoulder. \nRYAN People say these things all the time. It comes with the trade. \nNATALIE They do? \nRYAN Sure. People are always saying crazy stuff. They get worked up. \nNATALIE She was so calm. \nRYAN (not quite sure) I think that's a good sign. \nNATALIE So they don't actually ever do it? \nRYAN No... it's just talk. \nNATALIE How do you know? Do you follow up? \nRYAN I mean, no, nothing good can come of that, but I don't think you should worry about it. \nNatalie is clearly still worried. \nRYAN (CONT'D) This is the job. Taking people at their most fragile moment and setting them adrift. \nBEGIN MONTAGE \nA PLANE PULLING BACK ITS GATE AND TAKING OFF \nWHITE COLLAR PEOPLE ARE HANDED PACKETS \nRYAN AND ALEX ENTERING A NEW HOTEL ROOM. THEY'RE BECOMING MORE COMFORTABLE WITH EACH OTHER \nINT. BOEING 757 - DAY \nLooking out the window at the passing landscape. \nOver the pastures and roads, we see GRAPHIC WHITE LINES AND NUMBERS denoting each mile as they click by. \nRyan tears a page out of AMERICAN WAY MAGAZINE outlining their mileage program and hands it to Natalie. \nGARDENER DRIVES A RIDER MOWER ACROSS A TINY STRETCH OF GRASS \nINT. HILTON HOTEL LOBBY - EARLY MORNING \nRyan turns a corner to find Natalie talking to her computer screen with headphones on. \nShe's having an iChat with someone, but we only hear her side of the conversation. Ryan decides to listen in for a second. \nNATALIE I'll be back soon. Not really sure how long this whole exercise is supposed to last. He's fine... It's hard for these guys to accept change, you know. (listens, rolls eyes) I... I'm not even going to answer that... No, I can't even think of him that way... He's old. \nRyan frowns. Checks a mirror. \nA NEW OFFICE - MORE EMPLOYEES REACT TO BEING LAID OFF \nNATALIE Someone to talk to, spend your life with? \nRYAN I'm surrounded by people to talk to. I doubt that will change. \nThe shuttle stops and everyone goes to grab their bags. \nINT. LOBBY, MIAMI HILTON - DAY \nRyan and Natalie enter, still having the same conversation. \nNATALIE How about just not dying alone? \nRyan stops to address this. \nRYAN Starting when I was twelve, we moved each one of my grandparents into a nursing facility. My parents went the same way. (A BEAT) Make no mistake. We all die alone. \nRyan turns, thinks of something, then turns back. \nRYAN (CONT'D) (ADDING) Those cult members down in San Diego with the white sneakers and little Dixie cups of Kool-Aid. They didn't die alone. \nNatalie looks steamed. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Just saying - There's options. \nOut of nowhere, Natalie starts crying. \nRYAN (ALMOST SILENT) Oh fuck. \nNatalie is now balling in the middle of the lobby. \nNATALIE Brian left me. \nRYAN Oh, hey... I... \nRyan goes to hug Natalie and she simply folds into his arms - A mop of tears. Ryan looks around for a place to set her down. Instead, he finds... \nALEX - Who gives a questioning look to the young sobbing girl. \nRYAN Hi. Alex this is Natalie. Natalie, this is my... friend, Alex. \nALEX I should give you both a moment. \nNatalie attempts a recovery. It's not graceful. \nNATALIE No, it's fine. I'm fine. Just stupid emotions. \nNatalie gives Alex a firm handshake. \nALEX Maybe a drink? \nRyan goes to challenge the idea, when... \nNATALIE Now we're talking. \nNatalie leads the way. Alex and Ryan exchange quick hellos. \nCUT TO: \nTHE SCREEN OF NATALIE'S CELL PHONE \nTEXT READS: \"I Think it's time we c other people\" \nINT. BAR LOUNGE - MIAMI HILTON - MOMENTS LATER \nThe three share a booth. Natalie is sipping a drink. She seems to have settled a little. \nALEX He broke up with you over text message? \nRYAN (SOFT DIG) That's kind of like firing people over the internet. \nBoth Natalie and Alex shoot Ryan a look. \nALEX (re: the ex-boyfriend) What a weasely prick. \nNATALIE Yeah, but what does that make me? Someone who falls for a prick? \nALEX We all fall for them. Pricks are spontaneous, unpredictable, and fun. And then we're surprised when they turn out to be pricks. \nNATALIE I followed him to Omaha. \nRYAN You did? \nNATALIE I had a job waiting for me in San Fran, when he got an offer from ConAgra. He told me we could start a life together. So I followed him. \nINT. CAFE - MIAMI HILTON - MORNING \nRyan and Natalie have a quiet breakfast. Natalie looks pretty worse for wear. \nIn the background is a TRAVELING SALESMAN rolling calls. He perks up for each message then goes back to being miserable. \nMeanwhile, after a little silent eating... \nNATALIE Last night got a little out of hand. I said things... I don't remember everything I said. I just didn't want you to think... \nRYAN Just relax. It was nice to see you cut loose. So, did you wake him up or slip out? \nNATALIE What? \nRYAN This morning... Your new friend. Did you wake him for an awkward good bye or just slip out so he could feel like a whore. \nNATALIE (NOT PROUD) I... just left. \nRYAN Protocol is always tricky. \nNATALIE I didn't know what was right. \nRYAN Sometimes there really is no right thing to do. \nThis doesn't comfort her. \nEXT. OCEAN BOARDWALK, MIAMI - DAY \nThe walkway overlooks a large MARINA filled with giant YACHTS. Ryan and Natalie are doing the photo thing with the CUT OUT of the engagement portrait again. \nNATALIE What happened to Alex? \nRYAN Had to skip town early to make a meeting. \nNATALIE That's too bad. Where does she live? \nRYAN Chicago. \nNATALIE You thinking of going to see her? \nRYAN I don't know. We just don't have that kind of relationship. \nNATALIE What kind of relationship do you have? \nRYAN It's, you know. Casual. \nNATALIE Sounds pretty special. \nRYAN It works for us. \nNATALIE Think there's any future there? \nRYAN Never thought about it. What's going on here? \nNATALIE Really never thought about it? \nRYAN (a good lie) No. \nNATALIE How can you not think about these things? How does it not even cross your mind that you might want to have a future with somebody? \nRYAN It's simple, you know that moment when you look into someone's eyes and you feel them looking right into your soul, and the whole world goes quiet for a second. \nNATALIE (finally, a break through) Yes. \nRYAN Right. Well, I don't. \nNATALIE You're an asshole. \nNatalie knocks over the CUT OUT and stands up. \nRYAN Oh come on, I'm just dicking around. I need your help... \nNATALIE Don't you think it's worth giving her a chance? \nRYAN A chance to what? \nNATALIE A chance at something real? \nRYAN Natalie, your definition of \"real\" is going to evolve as you get older... \nNATALIE Would you stop condescending for one second? Or is that one of the principles of your bullshit philosophy? \nRYAN Bullshit philosophy? \nNatalie, once confident, now takes pause. \nRYAN She's hardly ready for this. \nCRAIG GREGORY I've been watching her. She's great. \nRYAN (re: the webcam) This is a whole other animal... \nCRAIG GREGORY I mean, she created it. Natalie, you not up for it? \nNATALIE I'm... I'm game. \nCRAIG GREGORY Atta girl. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM, DETROIT COMPANY - MOMENTS LATER \nRyan and Natalie have a moment aside. \nRYAN Just remember, don't apologize. Don't tell them how hard this is for you. Today is one of the worst days they will ever have. What we feel doesn't even compare. \nNATALIE Got it. \nRYAN Just keep it professional. You're going to do fine. \nINT. CRAIG GREGORY'S OFFICE, CTC - LATER \nCraig is leaning back in his office chair, watching Natalie on his monitor. \nINT. ALTERNATE CONFERENCE ROOM, DETROIT COMPANY - DAY \nAn unsuspecting man in his mid fifties enters the room and takes a seat at a COMPUTER TERMINAL. \n(for the remainder of the scene, we will intercut between Natalie's room and the POV of the man's iChat session.) \nNATALIE Hello, Mr. Samuels. My name is Natalie Keener. \nSAMUELS (checking out the PC) What's going on here? \nNATALIE I wish I was here with better news, however your position here at Deckers is no longer available. \nSAMUELS What are you talking about? \nNATALIE You've been let go. \nSAMUELS What, just like that? I can't believe... Who are you? \nNATALIE My name is Miss Keener. I am here to tell you about your options... \nSAMUELS I work here for seventeen years and they send some fourth grader in here to can me? What the fuck is this?! \nRyan fights the urge to jump in. He is sitting next to Natalie, but just out of view of the camera. \nNATALIE It's perfectly normal to be upset. However, the sooner you can tell yourself that there are greater opportunities waiting for you... \nSAMUELS Greater opportunities? I'm fifty- seven-fucking years old! \nMr. Samuels is now on the verge of tears. Eyes red. \nNATALIE Anybody who ever built an empire, or changed the world, sat where you are now. And it's because they sat there that they were able to do it. \nWe remain in the room with Natalie and Ryan, but we hear Mr. Samuels crying. It's loud and embarrassing. It's coming from the next room. He's literally on the other side of the wall. \nNATALIE (CONT'D) There's a packet in front of you. \nSamuels picks up the packet and opens it. \nNATALIE (CONT'D) I want you to take some time and review it. \nSamuels begins to leaf through. \nNATALIE (CONT'D) All the answers you're looking for are inside those pages. (MORE) \nNATALIE (CONT'D) The sooner you trust the process, the sooner your next step in life will unveil itself. \nSamuels puts down the packet. The tears still coming slowly. \nNATALIE (CONT'D) I need you to return to your office now and begin to put together your personal things. \nSamuels doesn't move. He's just sitting there in a daze. \nNATALIE (CONT'D) Thank you for your time, Mr. Samuels. \nNo reaction. Just more silent tears. Natalie is getting nervous. \nRYAN (O.C.) Okay, start walking it in from the left. \nALEX enters frame, carrying the engagement CUT OUT. \nALEX I have to admit, when you asked me to meet you in Vegas... I thought we'd gamble, make out in a heart shaped jacuzzi, maybe see one of those weird French Canadian circus shows. \nRYAN There'll be plenty of time for all that. (directing the photo) One more foot to the left. \nAlex obliges. She checks out the engagement photo. \nALEX How do you feel about the wedding? \nRYAN I'm fine, I guess. (directing the photo) Okay great... walk away. \nRyan takes the photo. \nAlex picks up the engagement photo. \nALEX They're a cute couple. \nRYAN Think so? \nALEX Yeah, they'll make cute kids. If they're lucky, maybe look a little like you. \nAlex and Ryan look at the photo together for a second. \nRYAN How do you like Wisconsin in February? \nALEX Who doesn't? (SWEETLY) (MORE) \nALEX (CONT'D) I like it if you're there. Besides, I know a killer burger in Milwaukee. \nRYAN Northern Wisconsin. (CLARIFYING) What are you doing this weekend? \nThis quickly registers... He's inviting me to the wedding. \nALEX (CONT'D) No... \nRYAN What? I haven't even... \nALEX I can't. \nRYAN Why not? \nALEX I couldn't. \nRYAN I'm being serious. \nALEX You want me to be your date? \nRYAN Well... Yeah. \nALEX To a wedding... Jesus, Ryan. Your sister's wedding? \nRYAN It's not like I know her that well. \nALEX I'm just not sure if it's appropriate for me to... \nRYAN Look. You know. I'm not the wedding type. But for the first time in my life... I don't want to be that guy, alone with his drink. I want a dancing partner. I want a plus one. And if you can stomach it, I'd like it to be you. \nA long thoughtful beat. Alex sighs. \nALEX Okay. \nRYAN Really? \nALEX Yeah, I can't believe I... Yeah, I'm in. When is it? \nRYAN I feel like we should kiss or something. \nALEX Then kiss me. \nThey do. \nINT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL, MILWAUKEE AIRPORT - DAY \nTwo ROLL-AWAYS side-by-side, moving through the terminal. \nRyan and Alex walk in unison. They share a smile. Almost like they can't believe they're getting away with something. \nThey pass a LARGE AIRLINE ADVERTISEMENT featuring MAYNARD FINCH in uniform. \"We Value Your Loyalty.\" \nEXT. DRIVEWAY, CHALET SUITES - DAY \nALEX The basket was very lovely. \nJULIE Tammy wrapped all of them. \nTammy waves. \nJULIE (CONT'D) Ryan, you look so grown up. \nRYAN Me? You're the one getting married. \nJULIE I know, right? You haven't even seen my ring. \nJulie shows off her ring. It's not quite balanced and seems to favor quantity over quality. \nJULIE (CONT'D) (PROUDLY) Jim designed it. \nJIM raises a hand. This is Julie's husband-to-be and we can tell immediately that Ryan isn't thrilled. \nRyan thinks of something. He pulls out the 5X7 PHOTOS they took of the JIM & JULIE CUT OUT. \nRYAN I brought those photos you were asking for... \nJULIE (LIGHTS UP) Oh great! They go over there. \nJulie points to a table and Ryan walks over. When he gets there, we see almost a hundred photos pinned to a map of America. It's overwhelming. All of a sudden, his effort seems miniscule. \nRyan begins to pin his photos on the map over the cities where they were taken. He backs away to see it as a whole and his addition has already become invisible. \nRyan returns to the conversation with his sister and Alex. \nRYAN There were quite a few already up there. Almost couldn't find room. \nJULIE I know, isn't it great how everyone chipped in? \nRYAN What gave you the idea to do something so... \nALEX (HELPS) ... Substantial? \nJULIE Well, Jim has a lot of our nest egg invested in this real estate venture right now. So when we went over our finances, a honeymoon just didn't seem affordable this second... So I thought... Hey, just because we can't travel doesn't mean we can't have pictures. \nThe idea of this lands on Ryan pretty hard. \nALEX It was a great idea. \nJULIE Thanks. \nCUT TO: \nAN HOUR LATER \nRyan is stuck with Jim, talking real estate. Alex is having a chat with the brides maids about local relationship drama. \nJIM It's sixty acres up against the foothills. I subdivided the old Lazy W Ranch and took a nice slice for myself. \nRYAN Sounds nice. \nJim makes an exhale noise that means \"you bet your ass\". \nJIM Homes will go in the high fours. \nRYAN Must be a nice development. \nJIM (CORRECTING) It's a community, not a development. The concept is turn-key everything. You buy a maintenance contract with the home. We'll whack your weeds, we'll even change the light bulb. Furniture? You buy your own or choose a package. Seamless traditionalism, yet all the perks. \nRYAN Nice. \nRyan and Alex make eye contact. There's a joy in their connection amongst the ramblings of their company. \nJIM We all need a place to call our own. This is America. This is what we were promised. \nRYAN That's a nice touch. \nJIM What? \nRYAN That bit at the end about promise... I like it. \nJIM (a little embarrassed) Thanks. (LEADING) So, you still renting that one- bedroom? \nRYAN I gave it up. \nJIM (SURPRISED) You own now? \nRYAN No. \nRYAN Well, it's hard to define \"try\". \nJIM You seem happier than most of my married friends. \nRyan takes a beat. \nRYAN Jim, I'm not going to lie. Marriage can be a pain in the ass. And you're kind of right - All of this is just stuff on the way to your eventual demise. \nCUT TO: \nKARA EAVESDROPPING AT THE DOOR WITH A LOOK OF COLD FEAR \nBACK TO: \nRYAN (CONT'D) We are all on running clocks that cannot be slowed down or paused and they all lead to the same place. Some guys leave marks that last beyond their own mortality. Not guys like you and me... But some. But even those footprints disappear. (A BEAT) There isn't a \"point\". \nJim sinks a little. \nRYAN (CONT'D) I'm not the guy you'd normally want to talk to about all this stuff... But think about it - your favorite memories. The greatest moments of your life? Were you alone? \nJIM (thinks about it) No... I guess not. \nRYAN I don't want to sound like a Hallmark card, but... Life? It's better with company. \nJim nods. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Come to think of it... Last night, the night before your wedding, when all this shit was circling through your head... Weren't you two sleeping in separate rooms? \nJIM Yeah, Julie went back to the apartment and I was all alone in that big honeymoon suite... \nJim chuckles to himself. \nRYAN Kind of lonely? \nJIM Yeah. \nRYAN Hey. Everybody needs a copilot. \nThis resonates with Jim and he can't help but smile. \nJIM That's a nice touch. \nRYAN Thanks. \nJIM What's the mood like out there? \nRYAN It's not good... Emotional. \nJIM What should I do? \nRYAN (twinkle in his eye) Go get her. \nINT. ENTRY, CHURCH \nJim walks over to the huddle of bride's maids. They part and let him in. He kneels at Julie's feet... \nJIM I'm sorry I'm such a fuck up... Will you be my co-pilot? \nJulie gives him a perplexed look before smiling and falling into his arms. Tears and smiles spread amongst the girls. \nKara walks over to Ryan and pats him on the shoulder. \nKARA Welcome home. \nMONTAGE BEGINS AS A SERIES OF IMAGES: \n- Ryan and Alex getting dressed in a little kitchen in the church. They're in a hurry and a little sloppy, but there's a crooked joy in their faces. \n- Jim standing at the alter with the priest getting a pat on the back from his best man. \n- Julie getting walked to the alter by Jim's uncle. They pass Ryan, who looks on proudly. \n- The priest gives his blessings. \n- Jim raises Julie's veil. They kiss. \n- Wedding attendees file into the Chalet Suites Banquet Hall. \n- Ryan and Alex mingle with their table. \nRYAN Hi, I'm Ryan. \nWEDDING GUEST I'm your cousin... Harold. \nRyan sits on a sofa, holding his BACKPACK. A slick GOALQUEST HOST enters the room. \nGOALQUEST HOST You ready to rock? \nRyan nods and gets up. \nINT. CONVENTION HALL, LAS VEGAS - DAY \nRyan stands in the wings. He takes a breath, then steps out in front of a sea of people. \nThe GOALQUEST XX stage is like nothing we've seen yet. Large and professional. Blue Banners hang from the ceiling. Digital projectors show Ryan's Headshot - What's In Your Backpack? \nRyan sets the BACK PACK on a table and quickly unzips it. \nA breath. \nRYAN Last year, I flew three hundred fifty thousand miles. The moon is only two fifty. \nA long beat. Uncomfortable. Ryan looks at the back pack. \nRYAN Imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack... I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders... You feel them? \nRyan isn't feeling them. He is not inspired. He isn't believable. He's barely even there. \nRYAN Now, I want you to pack it with all the stuff you have in your life. Start with the little things. \nRyan is trying, but he can't find the will to do this. \nRYAN The... um... The stuff in drawers and on shelves. \nRyan takes a beat. He just stares at the backpack and thinks about all the things he has removed from it... And then... \nRYAN Excuse me. \nAnd with that, Ryan leaves the stage. Handlers try to figure out what Ryan is doing. The Host runs for the mic. \nGOALQUEST HOST (TO RYAN) What the fuck are you doing? (TO CROWD) Okay, everyone just relax. We'll have your next guest out in a sec. \nEXT. CONCOURSE, MCCARRAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY \nRyan hustles past SLOT MACHINES until he is actually jogging. \nINT. BOARDING GATE, MCCARRAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY \nRyan runs up to a gate. He's the last one to board. \nINT. BOEING 757 - NIGHT \nOver Ryan's shoulder, through the window, we see Chicago below as the flight begins its descent. \nINT. CORRIDOR OF LIGHT, CHICAGO O'HARE AIRPORT - NIGHT \nRyan on the PEOPLE MOVER under the ceiling of NEON LIGHTS. Peaceful music emits from hidden speakers. Ryan walks briskly past idle riders. \nEXT. RENTAL CAR SATELLITE KIOSK, CHICAGO - NIGHT \nRyan hurriedly signs a hand-held device, hops into a SEDAN and speeds off. The RENTAL CAR ASSISTANT suddenly realizes... \nRENTAL CAR ASSISTANT Hey, you forgot to give me your Devotion Club card! \nEXT. TOWNHOUSE, CHICAGO SUBURBS - NIGHT \nRyan steps out of his rental car and approaches the door of the townhouse - checking the address against a piece of HILTON STATIONARY. \nRyan stops, knocks, and puts on a smile. \nWe hear Footsteps. The door unlocks and opens revealing ALEX. She's wearing sweatpants and glasses. She's at home. She looks different. \nRYAN Surprise. \nBut there's something else. Alex is in shock... She's frozen. \nSomething's wrong. Ryan's smile begins to melt. \nA man's voice calls from inside. \nMAN'S VOICE (O.C.) Honey, who's at the door? \nA couple kids run by through the background, giggling. A man chases after them. \nAlex is still speechless. Her eyes are angry and apologizing all at the same time. \nRyan just stands there. Emotionally bleeding to death. \nRyan sits doing nothing. Others around him play Sudoku, read trashy paperbacks, work on laptops. Ryan just stairs at the stitching on the seat in front of him. When... \"Bing\" \nPURSER Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special announcement to make. \nPassengers look up. \nPURSER (CONT'D) Our pilot has just informed me that we are passing over the city of Mesa... which might not mean much to most of you, but means a lot to one of our fliers today, because he just hit TEN... MILLION... MILES... \nRYAN Oh no... \nThe Gershwin theme song for the airline rains down from the overhead speakers. Passengers clap. Flight attendants gather at Ryan's seat with big smiles and champagne. \nRyan doesn't even react. He's just stunned. \nThe flight attendants separate just enough for a man in a bomber jacket to squeeze through. It's Maynard Finch, the Chief Pilot from the commercial. \nMAYNARD FINCH (TO RYAN) That seat taken? \nMaynard gives a little salute to his flight attendants, then slides by Ryan to the window seat. \nMAYNARD FINCH You're the youngest yet to hit twenty mil. Don't know where you found the time... (REMEMBERS) Oh right, here you go. \nMaynard pulls out a MEMBERSHIP CARD. It's actually been stamped from platinum. \nMAYNARD FINCH (CONT'D) Seventh card we've made. Small club. We really appreciate your loyalty. \nIt has a pair of wings around \"Member Number 7\". Ryan holds it between his fingertips... Catches his own reflection. \nRYAN You know how many times I've thought about this moment? Played out the conversation I'd have with you right here. \nMAYNARD FINCH Really? What did you want to say? \nA long beat. \nRYAN You know, I... I can't remember. \nMAYNARD FINCH That's alright. Happens to all of us. (attempts chit chat) So, where you from? \nRyan looks at him straight in the face. \nRYAN I'm from here. \nINT. RYAN'S OFFICE, CTC - NEXT DAY \nRyan picks up the phone at his desk. He removes his new TEN MILLION MILE CARD and dials a number off the back. \nAIRLINE OPERATOR Hello, Mr. Bingham. \nRYAN Oh, how did you know it was me? \nAIRLINE OPERATOR This is your dedicated line. We reserve them for our most loyal and dedicated fliers. \nRYAN Oh. I'd like to transfer some of my miles. Can you open up an account under Jim and Julie Miller? \nAIRLINE OPERATOR Certainly. How many miles would you like to transfer? \nRYAN How many miles would it take to circle the globe? \nAIRPORT OPERATOR We have our \"around-the-world\" tickets. They're five hundred thousand miles each. \nRYAN Sounds perfect. \nCraig enters Ryan's doorway. \nCRAIG GREGORY Got a second? \nRYAN (to the airline operator) I'm going to have to call you right back. \nCraig takes a seat across from Ryan. \nCRAIG GREGORY What happened to you yesterday? I was trying to reach you all day. \nRYAN I got tied up in... personal stuff. What's going on? \nAn uncomfortable beat. \nCRAIG GREGORY Do you remember Karen Barnes? \nRyan doesn't. \nCRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D) She was part of a thirty person reduction a few weeks back in Wichita. Natalie fired her. \nRYAN No, I fire dozens of people a day. \n", "test1_input": "INT. LOBBY, PHOENIX HILTON - DAY \nRyan is at the check out desk. \nCHECKOUT GIRL Do you have your Hilton Honors Card with you? \nRyan smiles... \"Do I?\" \nHe hands it to her, close enough to camera, that we get a nice big close up of it. She runs the card and the screen pops up with information that makes her blush. \nCHECKOUT GIRL Oh my God... Do you like, live, at the Hilton? \nRyan nods in faux modesty. \nEXT. OUTDOOR CAR RETURN, HERTZ RENT-A-CAR - DAY \nRyan pulls up to one of the spaces marked with the #1 GOLD PRESIDENTS CLUB emblem. He hops out and a uniformed man with a handheld device begins to punch in the license plate number. \nRyan pulls out his HERTZ PRESIDENTS CLUB CARD and places it nice and close to lens so we can see it. \nThe card slides through the handheld device and we see the DIGITAL NUMBER increase by a few thousand points. \nINT. MAIN CONCOURSE, PHOENIX SKY HARBOR INTL AIRPORT - DAY \nThe automated GLASS DOORS slide open. Ryan enters the concourse and takes a deep breath of the temperately controlled air. He has arrived. \nRYAN (V.O.) This is where I live. \nSubtitles - \"Airworld\" \nRyan skips the long lines and steps directly into the AAdvantage Executive Platinum line. \nGlorious close-up of Ryan's AAdvantage Executive Platinum CARD sliding through the AUTOMATED MACHINE. Were it any sexier, we'd hear a moan. Maybe we even do. \nImmediately, the AIRPORT CLERK registers and perks up. \nAIRPORT CLERK Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham. \nRYAN (V.O.) When I run my card, the system automatically prompts the desk clerk to greet me with this exact statement. \nWe see it again... \nAIRPORT CLERK Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham. \nRyan nods back to the clerk. \nRYAN (V.O.) Had my status simply been gold or God-forbid, silver. I might have gotten a hello or a smile... Maybe. \nRyan continues to hit buttons, swiftly checking in. \nRYAN (V.O.) Loyalty is earned and rewarded with these small touches. It's these kinds of systemized friendly touches that keep my world in orbit. \nA ticket begins printing. Ryan snaps it up. \nINT. SECURITY - PHOENIX SKY HARBOR INTL AIRPORT - SAME \nRyan steps up and observes his line choices. He finds a few Asian businessmen and hops in behind them. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nRYAN MOVING THROUGH THE SECURITY SCREENING \nIt's a beautiful choreographed ballet of a bag handle collapsing, shoes coming off, a laptop going in a separate tray, wallet and watch sliding into a shoe, a boarding card sliding into a back pocket... both hands always moving, performing separate actions... It really is gorgeous. \nINT. AMERICAN ADMIRALS CLUB - SAME \nRyan enters and presents his ADMIRALS CLUB CARD. It has a hologram. The ADMIRALS CLUB HOSTESS immediately smiles. \nADMIRALS CLUB HOSTESS Welcome back, Mr. Bingham. \nRyan walks past a stack of newspapers on the way to the buffet, the whole time framed by an enormous window overlooking the tarmac. \nRYAN (V.O.) All the things you probably hate about travelling - The recycled air. The artificial lighting. The digital juice dispensers and mini pizzas stacked to their heat lamps are the warm reminders that I am home. \nWith that comment, Ryan slides into a leather club seat. A DIGITAL DISPLAY reads: \"Thank You For Your Loyalty\". \nHe opens his briefcase and pulls out his ITINERARY. He scans it. We see a string of flights, car rentals, and stays at Hitons. Then, something makes him frown. He pulls out his cell phone and dials... \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. ASSISTANT'S DESK, CTC - DAY \nRyan's assistant, Kevin, is not happy to be there. \n", "test1_true": "RYAN You have me in a Dodge Stratus in Kansas City. \nKEVIN They are completely out of all full sized sedans... \nRYAN (INTERRUPTS) Did you?... \nKEVIN (not the first time) Yes, I reminded them of your remarkable #1 Gold Club status and years in the program. They are moving mountains to see you in a Sebring. \nRYAN Fair enough. Any other messages? \nKEVIN Your sister Kara called. Needs to speak urgently about your sister's wedding. I told her you were midair and not even I knew your final destination. \nRYAN Well done. \nKEVIN And you got an invitation to speak at GoalQuest in Vegas. \nRyan pauses. \nRYAN GoalQuest twenty? \nFLASH IMAGE: \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nWe push in on an EASEL with a SIGN that features RYAN'S HEADSHOT. Underneath his name, it reads: \"What's In Your Backpack?\" \nINT. SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM, HOTEL - NIGHT \nRyan delivers his speech with a smile. \nRYAN (V.O.) Every once in a while I do speaking engagements. Motivational kind of stuff. But GoalQuest... We're talking major Tony Robbins shit. \nINT. ADMIRALS CLUB - SAME \nKevin examines the invitation emblazoned with a big \"XX\". \nKEVIN It's got a hologram. They're calling it Dos Equis. That's some pretty major Tony Robbins shit there. \nRYAN Talk about burying the lead. (EXHALES) I'll check in when... \nKEVIN Hold on, I have Craig Gregory for you... \nRYAN I... ah, fuck... \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. CRAIG GREGORY'S OFFICE, CTC - DAY \nFour words - Store-bought sports memorabilia. \nCRAIG GREGORY How's the road warrior? \nRYAN Twenty minutes from boarding into a world of bliss. \nCRAIG GREGORY Great numbers out of Phoenix. You know Big Auto is going to drop another 10K this month. \nRYAN No kidding? \nCRAIG GREGORY Yeah, Christmas came early. Wish I could have you in five places at once. I need you back in Omaha by the end of the week. \nRYAN I thought you needed me everywhere. \nCRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D) We got something big - Game changer. \nRYAN I don't know why you ever bring me in. Wherever I go, the money follows. Let me plant seeds, they'll grow to Oaks. \nCraig checks out a CUTE INTERN. \nCRAIG GREGORY I'm thinking of planting seeds right now. \nRYAN What are we talking about here? \nCRAIG GREGORY You'll see. (CHANGES DIRECTIONS) Today, I took my first crap in two weeks. Hallelujah. \nRYAN That's me, hanging up on you. \nCRAIG GREGORY Good. I love that sound. \nINT. BOEING 757 - DAY \nRyan sits one row behind the bulkhead. Left side. Aisle. \nRYAN (V.O.) To know me is to fly with me. I'm the aisle, you're the window - trapped. \n", "test1_id": 2046, "test2_input": "Ryan, Alex, and Natalie wheel their ROLL-AWAYS towards the elevator. \nNATALIE So, what's the plan for this evening? \nRyan and Alex share an uncomfortable silence. \nNATALIE What...? Oh, is it illicit? \nRYAN (QUICKLY) No... \nALEX It's nothing like that. \nNATALIE We are in Miami. \nRYAN ... We were going to hit that party for the tech conference in the hotel. \nNatalie notices a group of SOFTWARE TYPES mingling with badges around their necks. \nNATALIE I didn't know you could just attend those... \nALEX Well, I mean... \nNATALIE (EYES WIDEN) You're going to crash it? \nRYAN ALEX I mean, I don't know if...

CONFERENCE CORRIDOR, MIAMI HILTON - NIGHT \nRyan, Alex, and Natalie confidently walk up to the CHECK-IN TABLE and take BADGES. \nThey turn the corner. Alex reads Natalie's badge. \nALEX Jennifer Chu? \nNATALIE Oh shit! \nRYAN It's going to be fine. \nINT. SOFTWARE CONVENTION PARTY, MIAMI HILTON - NIGHT \nCorporate color balloons. Lots of guys in LOGO POLOS. That great hip hop song from 1998 is playing over the PA. \nWe find Ryan, Alex, and Natalie at a stand up table. They're now wearing badges. Natalie is pretty tipsy at this point. \nRYAN (TO NATALIE) You okay there? \nNATALIE Oh yeah... This was a great idea. (TO ALEX) You are so pretty. You're exactly what I want to look like in fifteen years. \nALEX Thank you, Natalie. \nA CONFERENCE LEADER steps up to an on stage MIC. \nCONFERENCE LEADER How's everyone doing out there?! \nPeople cheer. So do Ryan, Alex, and particularly Natalie. \nCONFERENCE LEADER I'm going to need you to all put your hands together for a very special guest - YOUNG... M... C! \nThe opening beats of the 90's jam \"Bust-A-Move\" blast over the speakers and sure enough, now-40-year-old rapper, Young MC steps out and starts rapping. \nYOUNG MC THIS HERE'S A TALE FOR ALL THE FELLAS... TRY TO DO WHAT THOSE LADIES TELL US... GET SHOT DOWN CAUSE YOU'RE OVERZEALOUS... PLAY HARD TO GET, FEMALES GET JEALOUS... \nEveryone goes crazy and starts dancing. \nRyan and Alex make it out to the dance floor. They're awful dancers, but they're having fun. \nRYAN Think she'll be okay? \nALEX Look... \nNatalie has already found a dancing partner, who can't believe his luck. She's all over him. Ryan smiles. \nEXT. BOAT - NIGHT \nA nice two story yacht that was obviously purchased before the bubble popped. Inside the galley, a group is playing karaoke. NATALIE, wearing BADGES like Mardi Gras beads, is singing \"Time After Time\". \nMeanwhile, near the back, Ryan and Alex sit with their legs hanging off the back of the hull. \nALEX Back home, I don't get to act the way I do with you. \nRYAN That's why I don't have a \"back home\". \n", "test2_true": "Ryan emotionally stumbles. \nRYAN You know about the back pack? \nALEX I googled you. \nRYAN You did? \nALEX It's what us modern girls do when we have a crush. \nRYAN Did it bother you? \nALEX Well, that depends. Is the bag empty because you hate people or just the baggage they bring along? \nRYAN I don't hate people. I'm not exactly a hermit. \nALEX You just don't want to be tied down? The whole responsibility thing. \nRYAN I don't think it's even that... I... First time I ever flew, I was sixteen. \nALEX You're not going to answer? You're just going to tell me a story? \nRYAN (smiles, continues story) It was January and I had just gotten my driver's license. The lakes were frozen over, so we piled into my car and hit the ice to do donuts. When, out of nowhere, I hit a soft spot and the hood of my car tilted up and I was sinking backwards into the water. \nALEX Jesus... \nRYAN I literally started to drown. Within a few seconds, I black out. Then, I wake up in the sky. I'm in a helicopter, laying on a stretcher. This guy in a uniform is telling me I was minutes away from dying. \nALEX Oh my God. \nRYAN Right? (relives it for a second) So just as we're hovering over the hospital, I sit up. And from there, I could see the whole western horizon. We'd been flying twenty minutes. Twenty minutes to reach a city I'd thought of as remote, halfway across the state... a foreign capital. (A BEAT) My parents had taught me we lived in the best place on Earth, but now I could see the world was really just one place and comparing didn't make much sense. And I remember thinking - Don't tell me this isn't an age of miracles. Don't tell me we can't be everywhere at once. \nThe idea settles in. Ryan returns to the point. \nRYAN I don't know what originally sparked the back pack. I probably needed to be alone. Recently, I've been thinking that maybe I needed to empty the bag before I knew what to put back in. \nAnd now they kiss. It's notably different from their previous kisses. Now, when they lock lips, we are reminded why people kiss in the first place. \nThen, all of a sudden, the lights go out on the boat. The motor has stopped. Ryan and Alex look back to find the software dude stepping out of the galley, drunk. \nSOFTWARE DUDE Hey... I think we're out of gas. \nRyan and Alex look out to shore... about 500 yards away. For whatever reason, they just start cracking up. \nEXT. PONTOON BOAT - NIGHT \nRyan and Alex are huddled under a blanket in the corner of the rubber boat as it putters its way to shore. \nCold, soaked, and smiling. \nNatalie and David are there too... still kissing. \nEXT. BEACH - NIGHT \nEveryone gets out of the boat in the cold knee deep water and splashes up to shore. \nINT. LOBBY, MIAMI HILTON - NIGHT \nRyan and Alex followed by Natalie and her make-out buddy, soaked from the knee down, holding their shoes, scamper into the hotel on the balls of their feet. \nINT. RYAN'S HOTEL ROOM, MIAMI HILTON - NEXT MORNING \nRyan's eyes flutter awake to see Alex getting dressed. \nRYAN Hey, you're up... \nALEX Got to fly stand-by and make a meeting in Milwaukee. \nRYAN (DISAPPOINTED) Oh... Okay. \nALEX (notices, teasing) Oh, no. I made you feel cheap. \nRYAN Yeah, all right... Just leave the money on the dresser. \nALEX (SWEETLY) I'll text you later so we can swap schedules. \nAlex gives him a peck. Ryan takes her wrist so she can't leave. \nRYAN I can't remember the last time I enjoyed spending time with someone as much as you. \nALEX Neither can I. \nThey kiss again and he lets go. Alex leaves and the door closes. Ryan just lays in bed for a moment. \n", "test2_id": 2047, "test3_input": "Alex slowly wedges herself headfirst through the window. Ryan climbs in after her. He immediately recognizes his surroundings. \nRYAN I took geography in here. (POINTING) That was my seat. \nALEX You ever fool around with one of your teachers? \nRYAN No. You? \nALEX Not until college. Come on, show me around. \nThey head for the door. \nA TEAM PHOTO OF A HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL TEAM \nA finger reaches and points to a teenage face. \nRYAN (O.C.) That's me. \nINT. HALLWAY, WAUPACA HIGH SCHOOL - NEXT MORNING \nRyan and Alex are huddled at the trophy case. \nALEX You played basketball? \nRYAN Point guard. Don't act so surprised. \nALEX I didn't know you were such a jock. \nEXT. LOADING DOCK, WAUPACA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nRyan and Alex walk passed a concrete ledge. \nRYAN My first fight. \nALEX How'd it go? \nRYAN Got my ass kicked. \nINT. STAIRWELL, WAUPACA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nRyan shows an area behind the stairwell. \nRYAN This is where we used to go to make out. \nALEX Very romantic. \nCUT TO: \nRYAN AND ALEX KISSING UNDER THE STAIRWELL \nEXT. SOCCER FIELD, WAUPACA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nAlex and Ryan sit tight like teenagers on the team bench. \nALEX I'm really happy I came here. \nThe school soccer team takes the field for practice. \nRYAN (to the team) Go Cougars! \nPlayers look back at him strangely. \nRyan's phone rings. \nRYAN (checks caller ID) It's Kara. \nThe first thing we hear is crying in the background. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. CHURCH - DAY \nKara is on her cell phone. Behind her in the deep background, we see bridesmaids consoling Julie. \nKARA Ryan, where are you? We're having a meltdown here. \nRYAN What's wrong? What happened? \nKARA It's Jim. Can you get back here? We need your help. \nRYAN Yeah, of course... \nEXT. CHURCH - DAY \n", "test3_true": "ALEX I'll grab your suit. (ADDING) Good luck. \nINT. ENTRY, CHURCH - DAY \nRyan immediately spots Julie sobbing and being consoled by her bride's maids. The groomsmen are huddled in another corner, embarrassed and confused. Kara splits from the brides maids and takes Ryan aside. \nRYAN What happened? \nKARA Jim's got cold feet. \nRYAN Today? \nKARA That's how cold feet work. \nRYAN What do you want me to do? \nKARA Talk to him. \nRYAN You want me to talk to him? \nKARA Hey, it's either you or me. You know my record. I've already struck out once. \nRYAN I haven't been to bat. I haven't been in the dugout. \nKARA Don't you talk for a living? Motivational type stuff? \nRYAN I tell people how to avoid commitment. \nA beat. \nKARA What kind of fucked up message is that? \nRYAN It's a philosophy. \nKARA It's stupid. \nRYAN Hey, it might have helped you. \nA beat of stalemate. \nKARA Come on, Ryan. You haven't been around much. Fuck, you basically don't exist to us. I know you want to be there for her... Well here it is. This is your chance. \nRyan takes a breath. \nINT. SUNDAY SCHOOL ROOM, CHURCH - DAY \nRyan quietly steps in to find Jim, half dressed in a tux reading the children's book \"The Velveteen Rabbit\". Jim sniffles. Ryan goes to leave, when... \nJIM Ryan? \nRYAN Oh, hey Jim. \nJIM You ever read this? \nRYAN Yeah, it's pretty powerful stuff. \nJIM I'll say. \nRYAN Kara mentioned you were having some... thoughts? \nJim puts down the book. \nJIM I don't think I can do this. \nRYAN Okay. What makes you say that today? \nJIM I was just laying there last night in bed and I couldn't sleep. I was thinking about the wedding and the ceremony and all. Us buying a house and moving in together. Having a kid... Having another kid... (begins to snowball) ... Thanksgiving, Christmas, spring break, football games, all of a sudden they're out of school, getting jobs, getting married, And then, you know... I'm a grandparent. I'm retired. Before you know it - I'm dead... and I just kept thinking... \"What's the point?\" \nRyan gulps. Fuck. \nJIM (CONT'D) (now asking Ryan directly) I mean what is the point? \nRYAN The point? \nJIM Yeah, I mean, what am I starting here? \nRYAN (DANCING) It's marriage... it's the most beautiful thing on Earth... you know, what everyone aspires to... \nJIM You never got married. \nRYAN That's true... \nJIM You never even tried. \n", "test3_id": 2048}

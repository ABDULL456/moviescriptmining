SASHA Take off the rest of those rags and get dressed.  Then get out. 
ARCHER Not until I finish my business with your brother. 
SASHA I told him to keep those creeps away -- but you're just too big an attraction. (calming herself) Look, if the F.B.I. finds out you've been here -- I'll lose my son.  So please, just go. 
For the first time, Archer sees not a hardened felon -- but a frightened, protective mother.  And he realizes the effect his own relentless obsession has had on her. 
ARCHER I know I've done some things that made your life harder... 
SASHA How would you?  You walked out and never looked back. 
ADAM enters, heading for his toys -- his presence cooling Sasha's deep-seated anger.  Archer finishes dressing. 
ARCHER I'm not the same person you remember.  And for what it's worth, I'm sorry... 
Her harsh look softens imperceptively -- like that of a woman trying to hate someone she still loves. 
ARCHER Not a bad fit. 
SASHA They should.  They're yours. 
ARCHER Nice-looking kid, too 
SASHA Of course he is... 
Sasha fidgets, struggling with a deep inner turmoil. Then... 
SASHA Adam, come here... I want you to meet your father. 
Archer's face pales over in shock. 
EXT. SASHA'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Their silhouettes are visible against the shades. 
PULL BACK... 
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
Castor, Buzz, Wanda and Loomis peer at the silhouettes. 
CASTOR (into cellular) We've got him sighted.  Okay, Pollux, pull out. 
BUZZ What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother? 
CASTOR I've never been more certain of anything.  Get everyone in position.  Remember -- shoot to kill. 
Before Buzz can object, Castor's eyes say "don't argue." 
BUZZ You heard the man -- let's saddle up! 
INT. SASHA'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Playing with his toys, Adam does not see Archer's icy gaze. 
ARCHER How old is he? 
SASHA Five.  No one knows you're his father.  I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you... 
ADAM Bang!  Bang!  Bang! 
Startled, they turn to see Adam pointing a toy gun at them.  Upset, she takes it from his hands. 
SASHA You know Mommy doesn't like you playing with these things... 
She kicks the toy aside and lifts Adam -- offering him to Archer.  Awkwardly, Archer takes the boy. 
Archer's emotions avalanche as his grip tightens -- his big hands dwarfing the little boy's body. 
SASHA You're not holding him right... Caz... 
Archer isn't hearing Sasha.  He's lost in his own memory... the sound of a CAROUSEL... a KID'S LAUGHTER... a GUNSHOT... 
Then Adam smiles -- perhaps the way Matthew once smiled. It pulls something up from inside Archer -- something strong.  He regains control, dumping the child into Sasha's arms. 
ARCHER He's not my son. 
SASHA Yes, he is -- ! 
Then something alerts Archer -- maybe the fleeting shadows that blot out the window-light for the barest second. 
ARCHER Get down! 
K-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM!  The WINDOW PANES SHATTER -- as TEARGAS GRENADES and GUNFIRE riddles the loft. 
OUTSIDE 
across the way, Castor directs the FIREPOWER.

FEMALE GUARDIAN She fell. She wasn't moving. They threw her body in the trunk of the car and drove away. 
FLASHBACK: Guardian's POV through window. We glimpse through a dirty window, Pinta's body being put into a car trunk. 
CREASY Who?   Who's they? 
FEMALE GUARDIAN The boss's brother, I recognize his voice. It's high pitched. We call him Woody Woodpecker. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                          94. 
CREASY Now listen to me. If you tell me where to find the boss. I will let you live. 
FEMALE GUARDIAN Please.    I don't know. 
And Creasy stands there a moment. Realizes she is telling the truth. Lost. And the sound that snaps him out of it... A GIRL CRYING. And Creasy is suddenly moving down... 
THE HALLWAY 
After the sound.    He kicks open a door.       There! 
In a 8' X 4' room.       A 12-year-old GIRL.    Bound and blindfolded. 
FLASHCUT:   We think it's Pinta for a heartbeat, but it's not. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.   GUARDIA DE SEGUIDAD - NIGHT 
A window to the left explodes as the room is enveloped in flames. The front door opens, a weird sight. Creasy exits holding both the 12-year-old's hand and the Female Guardian who's bound and blindfolded in her underwear. 
They walk straight at camera as flames shoot out of the roof. Creasy has set the place on fire. Creasy is on fire. And as they continue to walk towards us... 
CUT TO: 
BLACK SCREEN 
CREASY'S VOICE Roman chapter 13:7. Therefore whoever resists authority will bring judgement on themselves. Now it is time to awake out of sleep for our salvation is nearer than we first believed.

A telephone ringing.       Rosanna at her desk.    She picks up the phone. 
ROSANNA Rosanna Guerrero. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    95. 
CREASY'S VOICE It's Creasy. 
ROSANNA Where are you? 
CREASY'S VOICE Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe? 
ROSANNA Last night.    Do you know something? 
CREASY'S VOICE What was her name? 
ROSANNA Camila.   Camila Valencias. 
EXT.   ALLEYWAY - ACROSS FROM NEWSPAPER - NIGHT 
Creasy on the cellphone, the small Russian Taurus in the background. He stands outside the building still holding the little girl's hand. She has the same lost look he does. Female Guardian in the back of car. 
CREASY Camila. 
The girl looks up at the name. 
CREASY (into phone) I've got her. 
EXT.   ICE CREAM STAND - BUSY MEXICAN CITY STREET - NIGHT 
Creasy hands the girl an ice cream cone. He looks over as Rosanna hurries over from across the street. 
Creasy puts the little girl's hand into Rosanna's. 
CREASY I need something. Do you have banking connections? 
ROSANNA (hesitates, then...) I have connections. 
Creasy hands her the ATM card. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    96. 
CREASY The PIN number is 4-7-4-7.    I need to know whose account it is. 
Rosanna notices the blood on Creasy's shirt.    Near his stomach. 
ROSANNA Where do I find you? 
CREASY I'll call you tomorrow. 
Creasy looks at the girl and starts off, then looks back. 
CREASY What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos? 
ROSANNA He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list. 
CREASY Where does he live? 
ROSANNA He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide. 
CREASY Give me the address. 
NOTE: THE FOLLOWING SCENE SHOULD PLAY AT THE BURNED OUT SAFEHOUSE WITH ROSANNA.

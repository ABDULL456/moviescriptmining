Gandhi and Charlie step back. And as the troop goes past we see from their point of view a group of Indian bearers, trotting in the middle of the horsemen, carrying two litters -- covered, each hanging by straps from a long pole -- and each bearing a badly wounded British soldier; one appears to be dead. 
OUTSKIRTS OF VILLAGE - EXTERIOR - DAY 
The shadow of a train moves slowly along the ground, a sense of tension and foreboding. We hear the engine chugging slowly. The camera lifts. Gandhi and Charlie stand at a window, staring out grimly. Other passengers are looking off too. Ba is seated, staring straight ahead, her face taut, deliberately not seeing what the others are seeing. 
GALLOWS - EXTERIOR - DAY 
Their point of view: On a hill across from the railroad track part of a prison wall is visible. In front of it a thick pole is straddled across two others. From this crude gallows two Indian men hang by the neck. One is in turban and dhoti, the other in a tunic. The sound of the train stopping. 
VILLAGE - EXTERIOR - DAY 
Close shot. Incense rising in shot. The camera pulls back and back. The incense is burning in a bowl sitting before Gandhi on a make-shift platform set in the little valley between the train line and the little hill where the Indian men have been hanged. A small crowd sits in a crescent before him, Ba and Charlie are bent in prayer on the platform behind him. When the camera comes to rest, the edge of the gallows and a portion of one of the hanged men is in the frame. We know we are looking from someone's point of view near the prison wall. 
Finally, Gandhi lifts his head. 
GANDHI (at first distant, as from the hill) I ask you to pray for those who died. (Closer) For the English soldiers... (a murmur) who were doing what they thought was right. (Closer) And for the brave terrorists whose patriotism led them to do what was wrong. 
The murmur of resistance from the crowd is louder at this. Gandhi shakes his head at the dissent. 
GANDHI It is not my law, it is the law of creation. We reap what we sow. Out there in the fields -- and in our hearts. Violence sows hatred, and the will to revenge. In them. And in us. 
He looks up. 
HILLSIDE - HIS POINT OF VIEW 
The troop leader, on horseback, is on the hill beside the gallows. The first view of Gandhi on the platform was his. Some of his troops are lined up beside him. He stares down at Gandhi coldly. 
PATEL'S SWIMMING POOL - EXTERIOR - DAY 
Patel lounges in the water on his back, supported by a large air pillow. Nehru sits at the side of the pool in a swimming suit, his feet dangling in the water. Jinnah sits under an umbrella in an elegant white suit, being served tea by one of three or four servants around. Patel spews a fountain of water. 
PATEL I agree with Jinnah. Now that the Americans are in, the war will end soon. The Germans are worn out as it is... (he rolls over, facing Nehru) and our first act should be to convene a Congress Party convention and demand independence. 
Nehru takes an iced drunk from a servant. 
JINNAH And we must speak with one voice -- united. 
The others assent. Nehru shakes his head wistfully. 
PATEL (it reminds him) Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway? 
NEHRU He's "discovering" India. 
JINNAH (cynically) Which is a lot better than causing trouble where it matters. Invite him -- let him say his piece about South Africa -- and then let him slip into oblivion. 
CUT TO: 
TRAIN - EXTERIOR - DAY 
A fireman heaps coal into an engine's boiler. 
The train passes camera to the Third Class section, which seems besieged by humanity. People cling to the outside of each door and many more are seated on the central wooden planks on the roofs of the two coaches. 
THIRD CLASS COACH - EXTERIOR - DAY 
Gandhi and Charlie are riding on the outside of the coach, hanging on through the door, and both enjoying it immensely. Ba, inside the jammed coach, finds it very unfunny. She has a grip on one of Gandhi's arms. 
BA (quietly, private) Please! You're being foolish! 
GANDHI There's no room! And the air is lovely. 
She grimaces severely and tugs at him. 
CHARLIE No violence, please. 
GANDHI Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall. 
Featuring the roof. And Indian squats right on the edge of the roof above Charlie. He is looking down, offering a hand. 
INDIAN (over the sound of the engine) Englishman Sahib! 
Charlie, who has been grinning, suddenly looks baffled, not to say appalled. 
INDIAN Come! Come! There is room! 
His hand still dangles in offering to the tall Charlie. 
Another angle. Two other Indians on the roof move to where they can grip the first Indian's other arm, as counterforce to the weight of Charlie. 
FIRST INDIAN (to Charlie) Place the foot on the window. 
Featuring Charlie. Hesitatingly, he grips the inside of the window higher, and starts to swing one foot onto the window ledge. 
GANDHI (amused, but disconcerted) What are you doing? 
CHARLIE (grimly) Going nearer to God! 
Gandhi, baffled a second, sees the outstretched hand above them, and in puckish complicity, helps boost Charlie up. 
Long shot. As Charlie reaches up, his hand is grasped and he starts to scramble and be pulled up to the roof. 
Featuring Gandhi and Ba. As Charlie's leg, assisted by Gandhi, starts to leave its lodging on the window ledge Ba suddenly turns, sees it, and grabs for it in alarm. 
BA Charlie! Be careful!! 
Close shot. Charlie. His face flat on the roof of the train as his arm is still gripped by the Indian, but his leg is being pulled from behind. 
CHARLIE (desperately) Mohan -- !! 
Resume Gandhi and Ba. Gandhi quickly moves to free Ba's hand from Charlie's leg and almost loses his own grip. 
He grabs the window again. 
GANDHI Let go! You'll kill him! 
Ba is confused. 
GANDHI Let go! Let go! 
With one hand he pries at her grip. In the chaos of instructions others in the coach are helping Gandhi, and Ba senses she is doing something wrong, but is still not sure what. She lets go. 
Close shot. Charlie. A desperate sigh of relief. 
Long shot. Charlie is pulled on up to the top of the coach. 
Featuring Charlie as he sits, puffing and recovering from the fright.

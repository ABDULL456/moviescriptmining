BARTENDER (CONT'D) 
I SAID GET OUTTA HERE!!! Neckbone gathers his friend and leads him away. 
NECKBONE Thanks a lot asshole! 
(TO ELLIS) Come on man. They head over to Neckbone's dirt bike. He pulls out the key and climbs on. Ellis hesitates. 
NECKBONE (CONT'D) I'll take you home. 
ELLIS We're gonna have to tell Mud. Neckbone drops his head, nods reluctantly. 
100 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - NIGHT 100 
The boys struggle to pull the heavy motor out of their boat. It hits the shoreline with a thud. They lean over it, sucking air. 
ELLIS Just leave it. Mud'll have to help get it. 
NECKBONE What're you gonna tell him? 
ELLIS I'll just tell him the truth. 
101 EXT. ISLAND/SOUTHERN SHORE - NIGHT 101 
Mud stands at the back of the boat, which now rests on the boat trailer near the water. His face is clean shaven and his hair is wetted back. His shirt, still filthy, is tucked into his pants. He whistles and works by the light of a small fire nearby. Ellis steps out from behind a tree. He's holding the grocery sack that was left on his houseboat. 
ELLIS 
MUD! Mud, hearing the voice, quickly puts down his tools and turns to the woods. He smooths his clothes down. 
MUD What you say there?! Ellis appears out of the dark, followed by Neckbone. Mud's eyes search the treeline for Juniper. 
MUD (CONT'D) What you say Ellis? Ellis can't look him in the eye. 
ELLIS We got that motor. 
MUD Is Juniper okay? 
ELLIS Yeah. 
MUD Where is she? 
ELLIS She didn't meet up with us. 
MUD What happened? Was it Carver? 
ELLIS It wasn't Carver. Mud straightens up, prepares for the news. 
MUD What's goin' on Ellis? 
ELLIS She was supposed to meet us on the side of the motel. She never showed up. We went asking for her. The motel clerk told us she went to a bar out on 61. 
MUD What? 
ELLIS We tracked her down. She was there with another guy. 
(HESITATES) They were together. Mud's face drops. He walks to the fire and shakes a cooking pot resting in the coals. The pot bubbles with roof tar. 
MUD She probably thought Carver was on to her. 
ELLIS She knew the plan Mud. She just didn't show up. 
MUD What was she doin' with the other guy? Ellis hesitates, not wanting to say. Mud pushes. 
MUD (CONT'D) What were they doin' Ellis? 
ELLIS They were playin' pool. Drinkin'. He was close up on her. They were laughin'. He kissed her on the neck. Mud nods. 
MUD And that's how it is. He takes the pot of roofing tar over to the boat and begins pasting some of the newly replaced boards with a flat stick. 
ELLIS What do you want us to do? 
MUD Just go home Ellis. Ellis looks at Neckbone, then sets the grocery sack on the ground.

ANNIE When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian. (beat) I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me. 
PAUL Why would you lose me? 
ANNIE The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave. 
PAUL Why would I want to leave? I like it here. 
ANNIE That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true. 
PAUL It is. 
She slowly reaches into the pocket of her bathrobe and pulls out a .38 Special. 
ANNIE I have this gun, and sometimes I think about using it. 
She is absentmindedly clicking the empty gun. 
ANNIE I better go now. I might put bullets in it. 
Robot-like, she crosses to the door and leaves. As she closes and locks the door-- 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, stunned, listening, waiting-- 
--here is the sound of the front door closing-- 
--then footsteps on the outside walk-- 
--the sound of a car door opening and slamming shut. 
Now comes the GUNNING of the motor. 
CUT TO: 
THE WINDOW as ANNIE drives by, hunched over the wheel. The MOTOR sound grows fainter, faint... 
CUT TO: 
BUSTER AND VIRGINIA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
BUSTER AND VIRGINIA are lying in bed. Buster is reading yet another Misery novel, Misery's Trial. Virginia is also reading. 
BUSTER "There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him." 
VIRGINIA What? 
BUSTER They're hauling Misery into court. 
VIRGINIA That's nice. 
BUSTER (mutters under his breath) "There is a justice higher than that of man--I will be judged by Him." 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE'S KITCHEN. 
The kitchen KNIVES on the counter. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, now using both arms, forcing his body up toward them. 
This isn't easy, it was a bitch the first time he tried it, but nothing's going to stop him now. He's leaning against the cupboard, using it for balance-- 
--his balance starts to go but he won't let it as we 
CUT TO: 
THE KNIVES, AS HIS HAND grabs the largest one, a fat-handled sharp beauty and 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, and you can sense the relief as he begins to lower himself to the floor. 
CUT TO: 
THE STUDY 
PAUL, back in his wheelchair, knife in his lap, carefully opening drawers of little tables, looking inside. He closes them, moves on, unmindful of the rain. Now-- 
CUT TO: 
THE SHELF OF PAUL SHELDON BOOKS. As before-- 
--except the "My Life" scrapbook is gone.

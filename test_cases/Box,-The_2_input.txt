ARLINGTON Thank you. Arlington then opens the BRIEFCASE and shows it to them. Inside... the bills are stacked neatly in rows. 
ARLINGTON (CONT'D) Two-hundred thousand. You can count it if you like. Arthur takes the briefcase from him and then closes. 
ARTHUR Thanks... we trust your word. Arlington offers him a broad smile. 
ARLINGTON As you should. He then turns to leave. 
EXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FRONT WALK -- NEXT 
They follow Arlington out onto the front walk as he approaches his car. The engine is idling... and someone else is behind the wheel... but through the tinted windows it is unclear who is driving. 
NORMA You said before that the box is re- programmed... 
ARLINGTON Yes. 
NORMA So now what? Are you gonna go and make the offer to someone else? 
ARLINGTON Why yes. That-'s how it works, Mrs. Lewis. 
(BEAT) And I can promise you that the offer will be made... to someone you do not know. He smiles... opens the door... and steps into the passenger side. The driver hits the gas and the car speeds off. Arthur moves out into the street... watching the car go... 
ARTHUR I got his license plate. 
INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER 
Arthur comes into the kitchen and goes to the desk and grabs a PENCIL. He then scrawls the LICENSE PLATE NUMBER down on a piece of scratch paper. 
AXV-4049 
ARTHUR What are you thinking, Norma? 
NORMA I don't know. Arthur paces around... thinking. He then opens the briefcase and starts counting through the money. 
ARTHUR Did he mean that we're next? Is that what he meant? 
NORMA I don't know. 
INT. POLICE STATION -- BURNS'S OFFICE -- NEXT 
Jim Burns sits behind his desk at the POLICE STATION. His SECRETARY (20s) comes in to his office. 
SECRETARY Your daughter is on line two. 
JIM Alright. He picks up the phone. 
JIM (CONT'D) Norma... 
INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT 
Norma stares at the money in the briefcase. 
NORMA Hey dad... 
JIM (PHONE) What's going on... 
NORMA I need a favor. 
JIM (PHONE) Sure... what do you need? 
NORMA I need you to run a license plate for me. Someone just came by the house... and we think he might... (looking to Arthur) He just seemed real suspicious and Arthur got the license plate and I need you to run it. 
JIM (PHONE) Okay honey... you need me to send someone over? 
NORMA No... if you could just run the plate and find out whose car it is. 
(BEAT) AXV-4049 is the number.

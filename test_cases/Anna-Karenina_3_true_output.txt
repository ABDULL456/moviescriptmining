The ringing sound of the wheel-tapper's hammer is faintly audible in Anna's hesitation. Anna shuts off the gallantry. 
ANNA Au revoir, Countess. 
COUNTESS VRONSKY Au revoir, my dear. Let me kiss your pretty face. 
Countess Vronsky does so. Anna turns to offer her hand to Vronsky. As Vronsky takes her hand, the train lurches and moves, unsteadying them both. 
EXT. PLATFORM, SAME TIME--DAY 
Oblonsky-- and everyone still on the platform--is shocked by a dreadful scream and shouting. The train, having moved a few feet, stops. Oblonsky hurries towards the scene of the accident, right opposite the gate. The Station- master overtakes him. 
EXT. TRACKS, SAME TIME, DAY 
The Wheel-Tapper lies between the wheels, mangled. 
Oblonsky joins the horrified onlookers. The Guards Officer arrives, too, with his bouquet. Then Vronsky arrives. He turns to the Guards Officer. 
VRONSKY Keep your people inside until this has been cleared up. 
EXT. PLATFORM AND EXIT GATE--DAY 
Countess Vronsky, Vronsky, Anna and Oblonsky, Oblonsky almost in tears, come towards the gate. A Porter follows with Anna's large suitcase, hat- boxes, etc. Annushka has the travelling bag. 
OBLONSKY . . . the sole support of a large family, they say. 
ANNA Can't anything be done for them? 
Vronsky glances at her. 
VRONSKY Wait for me, Maman. 
Vronsky retraces his steps. 
COUNTESS VRONSKY (TO ANNA) I've you to thank for that. 
She knows her son. Anna hasn't understood, but when Oblonsky looks back he sees Vronsky with the Stationmaster, taking money from his wallet. 
OBLONSKY What a good fellow . . . 
Anna catches on, doesn't like it. 
INT. OBLONSKY COACH--DAY 
ANNA Have you known Count Vronsky long? 
OBLONSKY Did you like him? He's in love with Kitty. 
ANNA Oh . . . (PAUSE) But we should be discussing you and Dolly. 
She scolds him like a naughty boy. 
ANNA (CONT'D) What have you got to say for yourself? 
OBLONSKY I've said it all--on my knees--in tears . . . Now I need you to say it. I'm going to the office, so you'll have Dolly to yourself. 
ANNA (SEVERELY) Don't be home late. 
INT. RECEPTION ROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE, MOSCOW--DAY 
Dolly pours tea for Anna. Dolly smiles at her wanly-- brightly. 
DOLLY Kitty's coming by to see you. She's all grown-up, and a bit frightened of you--the belle of St. Petersburg society! 
ANNA Is that who I am? 
Dolly . . . Stiva has told me. 
Dolly bursts into tears. Anna embraces her. 
ANNA (CONT'D) Dolly, I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart. 
DOLLY I don't know what to do. 
ANNA (SOOTHING) I know, I know. 
DOLLY I can't bear to be with him. And he doesn't care, he's got what he wants. 
ANNA What he wants is you. He loves you, Dolly. You and the children are everything to him. 
DOLLY Are we? And there is room for a governess? 
ANNA That was shameful, disgraceful. But it was not love. It was the animal in man, not the soul. Stiva's remorse is from the soul. 
DOLLY What about me? Does his remorse make it easier for me?-- 
ANNA I know you are suffering. But, Dolly, you must tell me . . . is there enough love left in your heart . . . enough to forgive him? 
DOLLY When I think of them together, I can't for- give him, no! 
ANNA My poor lamb. So you'd rather accept your fate . . . 
DOLLY My fate? (OUTRAGED) But I haven't done anything! It's him WHO'S-- 
ANNA Do you love him, Dolly? 
Dolly nods tearfully. 
ANNA (CONT'D) You love him, and he loves you, but you can't forgive, so your lives must continue like this for ever, with both of you wretched. 
She's winning.

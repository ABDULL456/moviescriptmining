JOKER (cont.) IT'S NOT FUNNY!!! 
BRUCE No... sense... of humor? 
The JOKER reaches out for the ticking time bomb. Thinks better of it and retracts his shaking hand. 
He can see the copter approaching now, slicing through the clouds. He screams, waves a flashlight in the air: his signal beacon. 0:20 and counting. 
The JOKER scans the belltower frantically. His eyes fall on the trapdoor. He races over, flings it open, starts down the stairs in a frenzy. 
There are no stairs. They've collapsed. 0:16 and counting. 
Screaming insanely, the JOKER vaults through the door and makes for the open stone archway. The copter is directly overhead now. A rope ladder drops from its belly. 
EXT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT 
The helicopter descends, its whirling blades stirring up a windstorm on the roof of the old abandoned cathedral. DEAD LEAVES rise and swirl in the churning air. 
INT. BELLTOWER 
The JOKER makes a futile grab at the rope ladder, almost losing his purchase on the archway parapet. He gestures wildly for the copter to make another pass. 0:12 to go. 
EXT. BELLTOWER 
A maelstrom of swirling leaves. And now, among the leaves -- roused from their resting place in the rotten rafters of the old cathedral -- 
-- A HORDE OF SQUEALING, CHITTERING BATS!! Filling the air like a black cloud, HUNDREDS OF THEM, taking flight in blind uncomprehending fury -- 
INT. BELLTOWER 
The JOKER leaps into empty space, grabs hold of the ladder, cackles in mad triumph -- 
-- AND SUDDENLY THE BELLTOWER IS FULL OF BATS. A SCREECHING SWARM, HIDEOUS, BLACK-WINGED -- SWOOPING THROUGH THE ARCHWAYS DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER -- 
-- WHO SCREAMS IN TERROR -- LETS GO OF THE LADDER -- 
-- and plunges into the night. 
TIGHT ON BATMAN. Six seconds remain. There is still time if he makes his choice now. 
Surrounded by the flapping of leathery wings, his body working on pure adrenalin, he unbuckles the belt. Lurches into position. Heaves it out into the darkness. 
It snags on the bottom rung of the dangling rope ladder. 
INT. HELICOPTER - POV CO-PILOT 
The CO-PILOT is hanging out one side of the copter, just enough to see what's going on. 
CO-PILOT PULL UP!! PULL -- 
EXT. CHURCHYARD - OVERHEAD ANGLE 
It's as if time has stopped. The world has grown suddenly silent. We're looking down at the JOKER, whose body lies splayed and broken on the flagstone surface of the churchyard. Slowly, elegantly -- we have all the time in the world, now -- we DRIFT DOWNWARD, closer, until his FACE FILLS THE SCREEN, the familiar chilling grin still intact. 
Sad clown, A-one crazy boy, staring aimlessly at the stars. Suddenly his face is bathed in a brilliant gasoline GLOW. 
POV JOKER 
Looking up he sees a beautiful display of fireworks, bursting and burning, spirals of color snaking through the sky as the helicopter explodes in eerie silence. 
REVERSE ANGLE - THE JOKER'S FACE 
It's all so lovely. The JOKER's expression is happy, almost childlike, as he gazes up at this private show. Gradually, though, the bright colors fade; and the JOKER's face begins to relax, the twisted grin dissolving at last as darkness sets in. 
FADE THROUGH TO: 
INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT 
AN ANCHORWOMAN delivering an oncamera EDITORIAL. 
ANCHORWOMAN As the details of the Joker's heinous plan become known, a city's gratitude goes out to the mysterious Batman. His whereabouts remain unknown, but Batman -- if you're alive -- if you're listening -- thank you. 
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 
VICKI at a fresh gravesite. She places a FLORAL ARRANGEMENT in the urn at the head of the grave; stands back to examine it; then bends once more to reposition the drooping flowers. 
VICKI I loved you too. 
As soon as the words come out, she begins to CRY. Then she gets hold of herself; rises; turns up her collar; and goes. 
The headstone reads: "ALEXANDER KNOX, 1956-1987." 
INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - DAY 
ALFRED, in his apron, on the phone. 
ALFRED No, Mr. Wayne is in Thailand. I'm afraid he's quite unreachable. 
INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY 
The glass-enclosed room which houses BRUCE's Olympic-sized SWIMMING POOL. Outside, snow is falling. 
In the pool, on an inflatable rubber raft, is BRUCE WAYNE. Beside him, waist-deep is the water, is VICKI -- helping him rehabilitate his leg and shoulder. 
VICKI I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.

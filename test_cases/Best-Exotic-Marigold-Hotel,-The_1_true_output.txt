CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) I've talked it through with Polly and the boys, and of course we all agreed. Ma will move in with us. 
HAROLD I think that's best, Evelyn. It's what Hugh would've wanted. They wait for confirmation from Evelyn. None comes. 
CHRISTOPHER Good. Settled. End of discussion. 
EVELYN That's what your father used to say. 
CHRISTOPHER 
MA - 
EVELYN When there'd never really been any discussion at all. 
CHRISTOPHER I want to look after things for you. 
EVELYN Like he did for forty years 
CHRISTOPHER Yes. 
EVELYN And look how that turned out. She turns to Harold 
EVELYN (CONT'D) How can any of us know what Hugh would've wanted? And would he have seen fit to tell us anyway? 
(BEST) Obviously the flat has to be sold. (Best, then to Christopher) And you're very kind. And dear Polly. But no, I won't be coming to live with you.

11 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 11 
Muriel has now been transferred to a ward. She is listening to DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR. 
DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR You need a new hip, Mrs Donnelly. It's not a difficult operation. 
MURIEL Easy for you to say, you're not having it. 
DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR Regardless. You do need a new hip. 
MURIEL I'm not getting it from you. 
2nd Green Revisions I0/01/11 10. 
DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR Not me personally, no. 
MURIEL Not any of your lot. 
DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR I see. 
MURIEL So when do I have the operation? 
DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR I'm afraid you'll be on a waiting list for at least six months. 
MURIEL At my age, I can't plan that far ahead. I don't even buy green bananas. 
DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR There is another way. Our hospital trust is funding a new pilot scheme, that will enable us to out-source you to another hospital, where they can perform the procedure almost immediately, and at a fraction of the cost. 
MURIEL Is it local? 
DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR That depends how you define local. 
12 INT. EVELYN'S FLAT/CHRISTOPHER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 12 
Evelyn is on the phone to her son Christopher. They're both sitting at computers. Evelyn's new-found dexterity is impressive. Around Evelyn's room are packing boxes, some already full. 
CHRISTOPHER 
(ON PHONE) When did you get a computer? 
EVELYN How far along is the progress bar? The strip at the bottom that tells you - 
CHRISTOPHER I know what it is. What are you showing me anyway? 
The webpage has come up. It's a picture of a beautiful old building. And underneath is written 'THE BEST EXOTIC 
MARIGOLD HOTEL'. As Christopher gapes in horror, he hears a mellifluous Indian voice. 
INDIAN VOICE 'Come and spend your autumn years in an Indian palace with the sophistication of an English country manor. Steeped in the tradition of the Raj, tucked away on the outskirts of Jaipur .'

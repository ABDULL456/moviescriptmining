PETER He doesn't know anything, all right? 
SAMIR Wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. You just give us the name of one drug dealer. I could talk to him. I have good networking skills. 
STEVE NORMAL) I LIED. ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT ME BEING A CRACKHEAD WAS TO HELP ME SELL MAGAZINES. I'M A SOFTWARE ENGINEER. 
PETER You're a software engineer?! 
SAMIR Working must be, must be very hard for you. 
STEVE I made more money selling magazine subscriptions than I ever did working at Initrode. 
MICHAEL Huh? You worked at Initrode? 
PETER You can't tell anybody about any of this stuff I told you. I mean, we know a lot of the same people. 
STEVE Actually, that all depends. 
He holds up his clipboard. 
Cut to later. Peter closes the door. 
PETER What am I going to do with forty subscriptions to Vibe ? 
MICHAEL I wish we had never done this. What are we going to do? You know what I can't figure out? How is it that all these stupid, Neanderthal, Mafia guys can be so good at crime and smart guys like us can suck so badly at it? 
SAMIR We're new to it, though. If we had more experience - 
MICHAEL No. No. Y'know what I think? I think we're screwed. There's evidence all over that building to link it to us. Even if we could launder money, I wouldn't want to. If we're caught while laundering money, we're not going to go to white-collar-resort-prison. No, no, no. We're gonna go to federal-reserve-pound-me-in-the-ass-prison. 
SAMIR I don't want to go to any prison! Why the hell did I do this?! I've never done anything wrong in my whole life! We weren't thinking clearly because you told us we were losing our jobs! And look at us now, we're, we're worried about going to prison! 
PETER Don't worry about it. I'll think of something. 
SAMIR Ass. I'm going home. You are a very bad person, Peter. 
Samir and Michael leave. Peter knocks on the wall. 
PETER Lawrence! You awake? 
LAWRENCE Yeah, man! 
PETER You wanna come over?

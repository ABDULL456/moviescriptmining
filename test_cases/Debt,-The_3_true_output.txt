DAVID It's going to take time. They need to open up a new route, they need to find political help. Maybe the Americans. Two weeks... maybe three. 
Rachel reacts with dismay. Rachel moves after David towards the living room. The camera continues after her. 
DAVID We work four shifts guarding him. We feed him at the end of each shift. We never leave him alone. 
STEPHAN (turns to Rachel, hard) And you're compromised. You don't leave the fucking house. 
DAVID We can do this. We just need to stay focussed. 
The three turn to stare at something off-screen. 
The camera continues into the room to find Vogel's body slumped on the floor, bound to the radiator, mouth taped, slumped, unconscious. 
We continue towards him...closing on his face...CLOSER...Then his eyes open and he looks at us... 
132    INT. BEDROOM/LIVING ROOM. SAFE HOUSE. - DAY                  132 
Rachel's EYES OPEN and she lies in bed listening to the muffled sound of Vogel CURSING and YELLING in German next door - a breakfast ritual that has been going on for days. 
IN THE LIVING ROOM 
VOGEL (In German) .....Fucking assholes! Fucking pig shit food! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck... 
David and Stephan are wrestling with an enraged Vogel, trying to feed him. 
A BOWL clatters to the floor. Vogel's shouts are muffled as his mouth is taped again. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    57. 
BEDROOM 
He continues to swear at his captors as best he can through his gag. Rachel tries to block out the sound with her blanket. 
133    KITCHEN                                                       133 
Rachel walks in and finds a flushed David wiping oatmeal off his trousers, the empty bowl on the bench beside him. 
DAVID (Off her look) At this rate he's going to starve himself to death before we can get him back. 
134    LIVING ROOM - LATER                                           134 Rachel sits in the armchair near the end of her shift, watching Vogel who is slumped asleep. He looks dishevelled, the oatmeal he refused to eat smeared down his chin. She can't delay the moment anymore. 
She takes a bowl of prepared oatmeal from the table beside her and walks towards Vogel, stirring the bowl with an unsteady hand. 
She kneels down in front of him. 
In the silence, we hear rain falling heavily outside. 
Vogel wakes, stays slumped, staring at her with dull eyes. She takes the napkin that was covering the bowl and wipes the food from his chin. Finally she removes the tape from his mouth. Vogel watches her without moving. She offers him a spoon of oatmeal, waiting for the sudden yelling and abuse. He says nothing, just opens his mouth obediently. 
Rachel feeds him a spoonful of oatmeal. He speaks to Rachel in German, subtitled. 
VOGEL My wife. 
Rachel ignores him, feeds him another spoonful. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) Is she hurt? 
Another spoonful, and another. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   58. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) Is she alright? 
An ALARM CLOCK on the table, rings - the end of her shift. She wipes his mouth, tears some tape from the roll. Vogel closes his eyes, a look of such genuine suffering it stops Rachel. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) Please? Tell me she's alright. 
Rachel puts the tape over his mouth and stands. David walks in and takes his place in the ARMCHAIR facing Vogel. 
Rachel begins to leave. She looks back at Vogel who is staring after her, eyes pleading. She hesitates then gives a small nod and turns to walk out of the room, passing Stephan who has been standing in the doorway, watching her. 
135    KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                                         135 Rachel starts to wash the oatmeal bowl. Stephan follows her in. 
STEPHAN You can't talk to him. 
RACHEL I didn't say anything. 
STEPHAN You can't listen to him. 
RACHEL I know. I just... STEPHAN (overlapping) I'm not angry - 
He rubs her back. Rachel stiffens a little. 
STEPHAN (CONT'D) - I'm just telling you - we don't talk to him. We don't listen to him. He isn't there. He isn't a human being. He... 
He stops himself. 
STEPHAN (CONT'D) We have a date. Ten days time. The Americans are going to help. 
Rachel looks at him, relieved. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   59. 
RACHEL Good.

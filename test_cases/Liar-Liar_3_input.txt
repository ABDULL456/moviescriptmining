(off his look) One-twenty-six. I swear! 
FLETCHER So on this single document, you basically lied at every opportunity. I'm sure a woman as vain as you would also lie about her age. It says you were born in 1964. What's the truth? 1962? '60? How young did you try to make yourself? 
VIRGINIA 
(JOYFULLY) Wrong! I didn't lie to make myself younger. I made myself older. I was born in 1965!" 
FLETCHER 
(FEIGNING 
SURPRISE) What? You're trying to tell us you lied to make yourself older? 
VIRGINIA Yes! "  lied so I could get married! So .there Mister 'I 
GOT-ALL-THE-ANSWERS-BECAUSE-I- went-to-law-school'! 
JUDGE STEVENS Mr. Reid, does this have a point? 
FLETCHER Oh, you bet it does, your Honor! (on a roll) My client lied about her age because she was only 17 when s he got married. Which makes h er a minor. And in the great state of California, NO MINOR 
CAN ENTER INTO A LEGAL 
CONTRACT WITHOUT PARENTAL 
CONSENT INCLUDING-- 
DANA (defeated, to 
HERSELF) Prenuptual agreements. 
FLETCHER (knows he has 
THEM) 
PRENUPTUAL AGREEMENTS! THANK YOU VERY LITTLE! This contract is void!!! The fact that my client gets nailed Â· more often than a two-by-four is irrelevant. Standard community property applies and this woman is entitled to half of the marital assets or thirty-seven point three-nine- five million dollars!! (to Dana) Yo . . . . a e . . . . T A T T T ! ! u         r           OSTT! 
(DRAMATICALLY) Nothing further, your Honor! 
A MURMUR OVERTAKES THE ROOM! 
JUDGE STEVENS (banging his 
GAVEL) Q uie t! Let me see-the license and birth certificate. All is quiet while the Judge reviews the documents. Then: 
JUDGE STEVENS In light of this new evidence, the court must rule in favor o f the defense. Mrs. Cole is hereby awarded half of the marital assets -or thirtyrseven million three hundred and ninety-five thousand dollars. The courtroom ERUPTS.       FLETCHER'S WON!      Dana, Mr. Cole are devastated.                    ' 
MR. ALLAN That son of bitch pulled it off! Mr. Allan gives Fletcher a thumbs-up; simultaneously, Miranda gives him the finger. 
JUDGE STEVENS O r d e r ! Order!! Now i understand both parties have agreed to joint custody. Is that correct? 
FLETCHER AND DANA 
YES-- 
VIRGINIA No!   I'm contesting custody. 
Fletcher freezes. 
FLETCHER What? 
VIRGINIA (re: her husband) Payback. For him trying to prevent me from collecting my thirty-seven million. 
FLETCHER He was entitled to prevent you. You committed adultery.' You only won because you're a liar, remember? . 
VIRGINIA No. You pointed out that my husband took advantage of a poor underage girl. I was the vic tim here. And now I'm going to hit him where it hurts. 
FLETCHER But -- but -- you said he was a good father. 
JUDGE STEVENS M r. Reid? Do we have an agreement on custody or not? Fletcher takes a distressed look at the children.

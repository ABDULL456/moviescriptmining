We are on an extreme close shot of a small dog.  Behind him, in the distance, we can see the mouth of the alley. 
The dog is on point, perfectly still, one front leg crooked and raised off the ground, his ears pointed straight up, his eyes in a fixed stare. 
A MAN 
is slouched, half-sitting, against the wall of the alley. He is motionless.  His mouth is agape.  His eyes are rolled up in a lifeless stare. 
He is wearing an overcoat but it is unbuttoned and reveals a blood stain in the middle of his chest.  His fedora lies on the ground near one of his splayed hands. 
There is something subtly odd about his hair. 
CLOSE SHOT   A LITTLE BOY 
Perhaps five years old.  He stares down at the dead man in front of him. 
CLOSE SHOT   THE MAN 
Staring vacantly. 
THE BOY 
After a moment, he reaches forward. 
THE MAN 
As the boy's hand enters frame.  The boy pokes once at the man's shoulder. 
There is no reaction. 
The boy touches the top of the man's head. 
The man's hair slips forward a couple of inches over over his forehead. 
THE BOY 
Staring. 
THE MAN 
Also staring, his skewed hairpiece ill becoming his stunned expression. 
The boy reaches forward and takes the hairpiece off the man's head.  Now a bald man stares off into smace, still looking stunned, still quite dead. 
WIDE SHOT   THE ALLEY 
The dead man and the little bov face each other in profile in the middle foreground.  In the background, between them, the little boy's dog faces us, still on point, still whining. 
The little boy is fascinated by the hairpiece he holds.  He turns it over and around, and looks from it to the dead man. 
Suddenly the boy turns and runs, away from us, towards the mouth of the alley, still clutching the hairpiece. 
As he passes the dog it turns and runs after him, wagging its tail, happy to be leaving. 
FADE OUT 
9.   FADE IN: INT   DINER EVENING 
A man sits facing us at the counter in the foreground.  His face is hidden by the newspaper he is reading. 
The page of the newspaper being presented to the camera bears a story headlined:  GANGSTER SLAIN.  The subhead: Politician's "Aide" Found Dead in Alley. 
After a beat the diner drops the paper to the counter, and we see that it is Tom, wearing overcoat and hat.  He is grimacing at whatever he was reading.  He stands and digs into his pocket. 
REVERSE 
Looking down at the newspaper an the counter, next to a steaming cup of coffee.  Tom's hand enters to put some change on the counter, leaves, and we hear his receding footsteps. 
The headlined story on the page Tom was reading is: THUNDERCLAP INJURED IN RACING MISHAP. 
10.  CUT TO: TRACKING IN TO CLOSE SHOT   PLAQUE 
Set into the brick of a building's exterior, it reads: SHENANDOAH CLUB.  In script underneath: Members Only. 
11.  INT   THE CLUB   NIGHT 
Tracking towards the front door as Tom enters.  He puts his coat and hat on the check counter. 
Tom Hello, Beryl-- 
Her arm sweeps across frame to slap Tom hard. 
Check Girl (off) Ain't you got a conscience? 
Tom stares dumbly. 
ON BERYL 
A diminutive woman in a french maid's uniform with a pill box hat.  She rocks her weight on one leg with her hands proceed defiantly on her hips. 
. . . It's a little voice inside that tells you when you been a heel! 
Tom Mine's been mum lately--what'd I do? 
Beryl Stood me up is all.  Made me wait an hour and a half is all?  Or maybe you don't remember sayin' you'd pick me up after work last night.  I seen heels in my time, sure, plenty of 'em!  But none so low as couldn't tell me to my face when they was sick of me! . . . 
She throws a check number at him. 
. . . You know where you can stick it! 
12.  CUT TO: TRACKING SHOT 
Pulling Tom as he walks across the gambling floor.  He is joined bv a nervous young man in a tuxedo. 
Mink 'Lo Tom.  What's the rumpus? 
Tom Mink. 
Mink throws a glance back in the direction of the coat check. 
Mink . . . I see you got your hat back. 
Tom Yeah, what of it. 
Mink Not a thing, Tommy.  I got not a thing to say. Listen, Bernie wants to see you.  It's important.

Delfy tips the nose of the plane down. The ice below is broken by jagged hills and yawning crevasses. 
DELFY It's right up here. 
He spirals down among the icy hills, visibility is poor. Heavy turbulence suddenly jars the plane sideways -- Delfy laughs at Doc's nervous reaction. 
DELFY (cont'd) I don't carry extra panties Doc, so keep it tight. (BEAT) There it is. 
He banks the plane and slips down into a valley. 
DELFY (cont'd) Three o'clock. 
CARRIE Yeah. Got it.      It's a popsicle alright. 
Down below is the body sprawled on the icy ground next to the crevice. 
CARRIE (cont'd) Red jacket.   He's American. 
EXT. ICE FIELD - LATER 
The Twin Otter is in the distant background. Carrie, Doc and Delfy, who has a gear bag slung over his shoulder, weave their way around huge ice boulders -- skirt small crevasses. Mid-conversation... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DOC ... It's always different when they freeze. Some curl up. Some stretch out. Some tear their clothes off. They get delirious. What was that guy's name? 
CARRIE Linger. 
DOC Yeah. He's lost in a storm. We can't find him, but we hear him on the radio going on and on about the Serengeti heat and his wife, Janet. Next day, we find him frozen solid, wearing nothing but his bunny boots. 
Delfy stops.    Grimaces.    Drops the gear bag. 
DELFY Jesus. 
The CORPSE is just ahead -- a frozen display of death. 
They all stare at it - the body in unnatural angles, the spiderweb of frozen blood. Delfy looks nauseous. 
DOC Never seen a dead guy? 
Delfy slowly shakes his head, no. 
Carrie moves up to it. Takes a look down the deep crevice four feet away. Can't see the bottom. She walks around to get a look at the face. Blanches slightly. 
DOC (cont'd) You know him -- 
CARRIE So do you. Think his name's Weiss. We Wintered-over last year with him. Played cards a couple of times. 
DOC The guy who cheated? 
CARRIE Yeah.    Geologist, I think. 
Doc takes a look. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
DOC Damn -- 
Carrie pulls out a DIGITAL CAMERA from a pocket.     Shoots a couple of pics. 
Doc takes a look up behind them. The ice steepens sharply to a vast plateau, scattered with jagged boulders of ice. 
DOC (cont'd) Looks like he fell from up there. 
Carrie pauses with her camera, looks up -- doesn't seem as convinced. 
CARRIE Then where's his crampons -- his gear? 
Doc looks around -- she's right. 
DOC Maybe down the crevasse? 
CARRIE Yeah, maybe -- 
Carrie glances to Delfy. 
CARRIE (cont'd) What's the closest camp? 
DELFY Brits -- about eighty miles west. 
CARRIE (looking at body - Soto) What the hell where you doing all the way out here? 
Doc reaches down and tries to move the body -- doesn't budge -- frozen solid into the ice. 
DOC Ah Christ -- he's a sticker.

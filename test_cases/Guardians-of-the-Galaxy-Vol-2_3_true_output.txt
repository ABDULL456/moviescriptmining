He angrily SLAPS off the flames as he reaches for a COMMUNICATIONS MODULE. 
INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE 
YONDU Not the whole ship. 
Yondu catches the arrow and walks out. 
INT. BAR/QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE 
Kraglin ENTERS, pulling latches and flipping switches and twisting dials on elementary flight controls. 
INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE 
With pained effort, Taserface PULLS UP A VIDEO SCREEN with a SOVEREIGN CHAMBERMAID. 
CHAMBERMAID (ON SCREEN) Who is this? You're not supposed to be on this line. 
TASERFACE I'm sending you the coordinates for Yondu's ship. 
INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE 
Yondu enters with Rocket and Groot. 
YONDU Release the quadrant. 
KRAGLIN AYE CAPN' 
INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE 
TASERFACE I only ask one thing. That your High Priestess tells him the name of the man what sealed his fate: Taserface. 
The CHAMBERMAID laughs uncontrollably at his name. 
Taserface looks really sad as he EXPLODES. 
INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE 
As Rocket and Groot, frightened, feel the SHIP EXPLODING around them, Kraglin pulls up one final latch - 
EXT. ECLECTOR - OUTER SPACE 
THE ENTIRE REAR UPPER QUADRANT OF THE ECLECTOR DETACHES FROM THE REST OF THE SHIP, while the remains CONTINUE EXPLODING. 
I/E. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE 
Rocket and Groot are amazed as the SHIP thrusts forward, away from the explosions. 
Kraglin keys into a JUMP POINT ahead. Nearby, Rocket pulls up the Navigation panel. 
KRAGLIN Where to, Cap'n? 
Rocket SETS THE DESTINATION: 
ROCKET Ego. 
YONDU NO, BOY! 
The Quadrant TREMBLES as they hit THE JUMP POINT.    It BLOOPS out of present space, making the JUMP to - 
EXT. DESERT - DAY 
The Quadrant POPS into a blue sky above a DESERT with two fighting KRONANS. 
INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - VARIOUS OUTER SPACE LOCATIONS 
Inside the ship, Rocket, Yondu, Kraglin, and baby Groot hold on for dear life as the ship VIOLENTLY SHAKES and THE LOCATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE WINDOW RAPIDLY SHIFT. 
Their bodies DISTEND SLIGHTLY. Yondu is furious. 
YONDU It ain't healthy for a mammalian body to hop over fifty jumps at a time. 
ROCKET I know that. 
YONDU We're about to do seven-hundred. 
Rocket looks bummed. 
EXT. PINK SKY - AMOEBA BLOBS - OUTER SPACE 
The Quadrant pops out of a jump point into this Pepto Bismol pink land, SMASHING THROUGH an AMOEBA-LIKE BLOB, and then through the next jump point. 
INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - VARIOUS OUTER SPACE LOCATIONS 
Kraglin, Yondu, Rocket, and Baby Groot all SCREAM, their entire faces and bodies distorting as if in some evil funhouse mirror. 
EXT. RED PLANET LANDSCAPE - VARIOUS 
The yellow sun CURVES SLOWLY WEST TO EAST over this magnificent landscape. 
"BRING IT ON HOME TO ME" BY SAM COOKE PLAYS. 
EXT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - VERANDA - DAY 
TILT DOWN to Quill, on this veranda, gazing out at the beauty. The Walkman is connected to small, jerry-rigged speakers nearby, PLAYING SAM COOKE. 
QUILL So I guess this could all be mine someday. 
Gamora isn't paying attention. She's fooling with a communications device, which has no reception. 
GAMORA Rocket? Rocket, you there?   Dammit. 
Quill comes up behind her, messing with her. 
GAMORA (CONT'D) What are you doing, Peter? 
QUILL Dance with me. 
GAMORA No. I'm not -- 
QUILL Come on. This is Sam Cooke, one of the greatest Earth singers of all time. 
Gamora lets out an exasperated SIGH, but, reluctantly, starts DANCING with him. She is incredibly light on her feet. 
Quill smiles and Gamora, despite herself, does as well. He TWIRLS HER AND BRINGS HER BACK IN. This is definitely not the first time they've done this.

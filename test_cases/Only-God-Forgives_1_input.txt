CUT TO: 
INT. ELECTRICAL SHOP - NIGHT 
Chang enters, followed by the others. Gunman Three is incredibly relieved to have found it. Li Po stands behind the counter - beside him sits Pan, a twelve year old boy who is severely handicapped. As soon as Li Po sees Chang and his crew arrive with Gunman Three next to them he knows the game's up. He can't run. His kid's sitting there... He approaches them with a heavy sigh. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) You know why we're here. 
LI PO 
(IN THAI) Yes... 
GUNMAN THREE 
(IN THAI) He set it up. He knows who ordered the hit. He'll tell you. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) Don't talk unless I ask you to. Understood? 
GUNMAN THREE 
(IN THAI) Yes. Completely understood. Chang turns to Li Po. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) Do you have anything to say for yourself? 
LI PO 
(IN THAI) I'm a salesman. Some of the things I sell aren't exactly legal... But I'll give you the man that hired the hit... Chang stares at him... 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) Good... Li Po summons the contact details on his distinctive looking mobile phone. Proffers it to Chang. 
LI PO 
(IN THAI) As for myself, I'm not scared of paying for what I've done. I just... just don't hurt my son. Chang looks down at Pan - who is just staring at them, not understanding the situation. Chang takes the phone from Li Po. 
GUNMAN THREE 
(IN THAI) You see? He knows. He's got the details. I told you he would. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) And I told you not to talk unless I asked you. Chang aims his gun at Gunman Three. 
GUNMAN THREE 
(IN THAI) Wait. You said if I took you to him you'd let me live. Chang shakes his head. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) I never said that. Chang fires. Gunman Three's brains spatter across the TV screens on the far side of the wall. Pan begins to cry and Li Po hugs him and tells him how much he loves him... thinking they're next... Chang studies the mobile phone. 
CHANG (CONT'D) 
(IN THAI) This him? Li Po nods - scared. 
CHANG (CONT'D) 
(IN THAI) Where do I find him?

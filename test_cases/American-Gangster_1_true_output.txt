He lightly touches his wife's bruised face and walks out. 
C303   INT. FRANK'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT                                  C303 
He comes down the stairs to where Doc waits.         As they head for the door - 
MRS. LUCAS Frankie - 
Frank glances to where his mother sits in the living room. Nods to Doc to say, Get the car, I'll be out in a minute. Goes over to his mother. 
MRS. LUCAS Sit down. 
He sits. She studies him in a way she hasn't since he was little. Eventually - 
MRS. LUCAS If you'd have been a preacher, your brothers would be preachers. If you'd been a soldier, they'd be soldiers. Do you know that? (he doesn't say) They all came here because of you. You called and they came running. They look up to you. They expect you to always know what's best. (pause) But even they know you don't shoot cops. Even I know that. Ana knows it. You seem to be the only one who doesn't. 
FRANK Is that where I'm going? 
MRS. LUCAS I never asked you where all this came from because I didn't want to hear you lie to me. Don't lie to me. Don't do that, too. 
She's not pleading, she's telling.       Silence.    Then - 
(CONT) 
C303    CONTINUED:                                                    C303 
MRS. LUCAS Do you really want to make things so bad for your family they'll leave you? Because they will. She will - (points upstairs) I know I will. 
Frank has some trouble looking at her. But then gets up. Walks toward the front door to leave. Hesitates near it a long moment. Then turns and walks upstairs. Trupo will live, at least for now, because of her. 
D303    INT. ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT                                     D303 
Down in the basement, the body bags are lifted from the wooden coffins. Set down on tables. The bags unzipped and the bodies removed. 
A rack of clean uniforms is brought in. The morticians begin dressing the corpses and applying make-up on the dry gray skin. 
New white military caskets are trundled in. Gold handles lifted. The bodies, clothed and painted now, are deposited on the silk linings. The lids of the coffins come down and cellophane bags containing folded flags are taped on top. 
303 - 309 OMIT                                            303 - 309 OMIT

The white caskets are taken to a loading dock, put in a military truck. Papers are signed, copies exchanged. As the truck drives off - 311     INT. ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT                                     311 
Two black privates on janitorial duty come into the room where the original plain wooden coffins have been discarded. They remove the lids, then the finely-crafted false bottoms, revealing in 4-inch cavities of each, tightly-packed bricks of Double UO Globe heroin. As they take them out, a gospel choir begins and continues over: 
312     EXT. ARMY HOSPITAL - MORNING                                   312 
A laundry truck idles. Stevie, the Lucas nephew who could have played for Yankees, jumps down, helps the two privates toss several laundry bags into the back of the truck. 
A313       EXT. BAPTIST CHURCH - MORNING                                  A313 
A minister on the steps welcomes the congregation which includes Frank, his mother, and Ana - 
313        EXT. PERIMETER OF THE ARMY BASE - MORNING                       313 
The laundry truck comes past a guard gate, leaves the base, drives past a stand of trees. As it passes, Richie, parked by his detectives' cars, recognizes the young driver - who's wearing the same Yankee baseball cap in his T.O. photo. 
As Richie and his detectives climb into their cars, two Lucas cars fold in behind the laundry truck. The detectives follow at a distance - 
A314 OMIT                                                          A314 OMIT 
314        INT. BAPTIST CHURCH - MORNING                                   314 
The sea of ladies' hats from above move in time with the gospel choir. As always, no matter what else is going on in his complicated life, Frank sits with his mother and Ana in their usual pew. The gospel music continues over: 
A315       EXT. BAPTIST CHURCH - MORNING                                  A315 
Frank emerges from the church, kisses his mother and Ana and put them in a car with a driver. He climbs into Doc's alone. His mother watches, wondering perhaps if he intends to go kill Trupo after all. As Doc's car leaves, so does another. 
315 - 318 OMIT                                               315 - 318 OMIT 319        INT/EXT. RICHIE'S CAR - MOVING - NEAR GW BRIDGE - MORNING19 
The laundry truck approaches a ramp leading to the George Washington Bridge. Richie, a couple of car lengths behind, follows. The truck continues straight.

From overhead, the laundry truck, the gun car and the van - and the detectives' cars following them all - converge from different directions - 
322    EXT. NEWARK - NEAR STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING           322 
Red Top's van makes a turn. As Abruzzo's makes the same turn behind it, the infamous Stephen Crane Projects rise up in his windshield. 
His foot comes off the gas. As the gun car passes, he sees Jones's car slow. Teddy's car approaches from another direction into the Projects, and Abruzzo sees Spearman pull over. Then the laundry truck turns in, and Richie's slows to a stop, like Abruzzo's, outside the grounds of the foreboding towers. The gospel music ends. 
A323   EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING                                      A323 
Doc waits in the car while Frank buys some flowers at a cemetery flower stand. The surveillance car cruises past. 
323    INT. TOBACK'S HOUSE - MORNING                                 323 
Toback, in his bathrobe, glass of milk in one hand, phone in the other ... 
TOBACK Where is it?

MICHAEL That's really, really sad. 
SEAN I think you just found something to write about. Michael opens his notebook, picks up a pen. 
MICHAEL (V.0.) Courage is a hard thing to figure. You can have courage based on a dumb idea or a mistake, but you're not supposed to question adults, or your coach, or your teacher because they make the rules. Maybe they know best but maybe they don't. 
SERIES OF REPEATED SHOTS: 
168 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - REPEATED SHOT - DAY 168 
Michael moves through the tough crowd. 
MICHAEL (V.0.) It all depends on who you are, where you come from. Didn't at least one of the six hundred guys think about giving up and joining with the other side? I mean, Valley of Death, that's pretty salty stuff. 
169 EXT. WINGATE - REPEATED SHOT - DAY 169 
Michael walks under the arch for the first time. 
MICHAEL (V.0.) That's why courage is tricky. Should you always do what others tell you to do? Sometimes you might not even know why you're doing something. I mean, any fool can have courage. 
170 INT. LAUNDROMAT - REPEATED SHOT - NIGHT 170 
Michael leans against the wall and tries to sleep. 
MICHAEL (V.0.) But honor, that's the real reason you either do something or you don't. It's who you are and maybe who you want to be. If you die trying for something important then you have both honor and courage and that's pretty good. 
171 INT. WINGATE - BOB'S LITERATURE CLASS - DAY 171 
Bob sits at his desk, reading Michael's. essay. As he turns to the last page... 
MICHAEL (V.0.) I think that's what the writer was saying. That you should try for courage and hope for honor. And maybe even pray that the people telling you what. to do have some, too. Bob, visibly moved, sets down the essay and smiles. 
172 INT. WINGATE --- AUDITORIUM - FOYER - DAY 172 
Graduation day and Sean sits beside an empty seat in the 
quick filling auditorium. He sees Leigh Anne marching up the 
aisle, a big smile on her face. she pushes down the row and 
plops down in the seat next to him. 
SEAN 
What? 
LEIGH ANNE 
(off Sean's' look) Michael's final GPA. Got it off Paul's computer. He did it, Sean. He did it! 
Sean grins, then... 
SEAN Wait a minute. You broke into the principal's computer?

the graduates move across the stage to get their diplomas.

Projected behind him is a picture of the cutest African- 
American infant the world has ever seen. 
ON SEAN AND LEIGH ANNE 
SEAN Where'd you find a baby picture of Michael? 
LEIGH ANNE Scanned it off an Internet ad for a toddler boutique. (off his look) Tell a soul and I'll rip your tongue out. IN THE CROWD: The Tuohys, Big Tony, Miss Sue, Bob and the other teachers all clap. 
174 EXT. WINGATE - OUTSIDE THE AUDITORIUM -.DAY 174 
Michael, diploma in hand, shakes Sean's hand. Sean moves close, looks him in the eye. 
SEAN I want you to know something. You'n me, okay? 
(BEAT) I never believed you could do this. But you did. And I'm as proud of you as I am ashamed of myself. I should know better. I'll never doubt you again, Michael. Michael smiles, nods, gives Leigh Anne a little hug then raps knuckles with Si and high fives Collins.

STANLEY (looks puzzled) Yeah. MOE Guy bends down to pick up the matches for you, you got a mark... you got this guy in your pocket. If he looks to you to pick it up, you've got a long, hard, tough sell on your hands. BB walks over to the guys, having just poured himself some coffee. BB You want to get in good with these people... you want to win their confidence? Good thing to try... get a five dollar bill, take it out when the guy's not looking, drop it on the ground. Guy looks back, pick it up, hand it to him and say, 'Mr. Blah blah, you musta dropped this five dollar bill on the ground.' Two things happen... he says, 'It's not mine,' you say, 'Musta been, 'cos it's certainly not mine,' or the guy takes it. Right away this guy is thinking you must be one hell of a nice guy... you're in. You start chipping away... you start getting inside those people. Stanley is quite taken by their information.   BB puts his cup down and grabs his coat. BB Come on, Moe, let's split. LOONEY (to Stanley) Yeah, we'd better go, too. Come on, Stanley. (to Carly who is hanging behind) Me and Stanley. It's like a first date. CUT TO: 
42   EXT. SUPERIOR ALUMINUM SIDING BUILDING - DAY                     42 BB and Moe approach BB's Cadillac. He sees that all the windows have been smashed in. Moe looks to BB. Looney walks up from behind. LOONEY What? You got a special bargain when you bought this car? They come cheaper without windows? BB reaches into the car and picks up a handful of broken glass. He tosses it up and down in his hands. BB This guy's looking to play tit for tat. That's not my game. I'm gonna play hardball. BB throws the glass down on the ground. STANLEY (to Looney, quietly) What's going on? Looney just nods for them to go, and they start to walk over to Looney's Cadillac. BB I'm gonna find    out everything about this son    of a bitch, and then I'm gonna    find the one thing that cuts him    to the quick. MOE Let's go inside... make some calls. 
BB nods and they start back inside. CUT TO: 
43   INT. POOL HALL - TIGHT SHOT                                      43 of a pool ball ricocheting off an eight ball. The eight ball drops into the pocket. Tilley throws down his pool stick. We  see his partner is Mouse. Gil sits in a chair against a wall. TILLEY Damn it! Damn it! I can't believe it... I can't believe I did that. (CONTINUED) 
43   CONTINUED:                                              43 MOUSE Well, then, believe it. There's no sense not to believe it, because you did it... so believe it. That's twenty more... you owe me sixty. TILLEY You think I can't add? He goes to rack to re-set. Mouse     goes over and puts a nickel in the juke box. A RECORD     slips into position, and Harry Belafonte's "Banana Boat    Song" begins. Mouse, in unison with the record, sings,    and is totally caught up in the song. 
MOUSE 'Dayo!... da, da, da, da, day. Daylight come and he wanna go home...' He sings very loudly, especially on the chorus. GIL (facetiously) Oh, this is going to be good. MOUSE 'Dayo!... da, da, da, da, da, da, da.' (he hits his pool cue on the ground for emphasis) 'Daylight come and he wanna go home...'

44   INT. ROOM OFF MAIN POOL HALL                                  44 Sam is going through some papers on a desk, and comes across an IRS letter addressed to Tilley. He notices that it hasn't been opened. He looks at the postdate mark -- it's five weeks old, dated January 3, 1963. SAM Jesus Christ! We can hear the "BANANA BOAT SONG" through the door, with MOUSE SCREECHING along with it. Sam takes the letter and goes through the door to the pool hall. 
45   INT. POOL HALL                                                45 He approaches Tilley who's just finished racking the balls. SAM Tilley. He nods for Tilley to go over to him. They start to walk together through the darkened areas of the Pool Hall. SAM Found this on your desk while I was going over some papers. He hands the letter to Tilley. 
TILLEY From the IRS. I never even remember seeing it. I must have left it with my other bills. I wonder what it is? SAM Maybe it's a refund check. Tilley opens the envelope and looks at the document. TILLEY Hum... says here that they haven't received my 1962 taxes. They seem to be saying that they didn't get my check for four thousand dollars. SAM What? It must be a clerical error. TILLEY I can't believe they spend all that time and energy to write to me... to single me out. SAM What are you talking about?   You didn't pay your taxes? TILLEY I probably forgot... people forget their taxes all the time... just slipped my mind... I got so many things on my mind. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
45   CONTINUED:                                              45 TILLEY (CONT'D) I figured they could wait a few years... it's not like they need my money to build a bomber. You think they're waiting for my money before they dig a new road? Are they all sitting there saying, 'Well, it's time we went to see that guy on Pimlico Road... can't run this government without his four thousand dollars.' (beat) I figured they'd give me a little leeway. I'm going to pay them... I know I've got a debt... I just need a little leeway. SAM You can't mess around with the government. Why don't you go to H & R Block, they'll take care of your taxes for you. TILLEY You think I'm gonna let some schmuck know all my business... have some guy pull me over the coals for spending on this and that. I need some privacy. SAM Taxes is serious stuff, Tilley. TILLEY I can just see that schmuck in that little tax shop telling people my business... how much I make... how much I spend... no way! SAM All I can say, is you better get a lawyer or somebody to look into this, 'cos the IRS, they don't fuck around. TILLEY Just what I need in my life right now... I'm in a slump and I've got the IRS on me. Like when something goes wrong, it's like... He throws his arms up in the air in exasperation. CUT TO:

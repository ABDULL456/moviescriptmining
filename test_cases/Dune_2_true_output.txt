The Baron briefly wonders at these words and then turns to Piter. BARON He's crying! (he hits Duke Leto) He's crying!  He's crying, Piter.  What does he mean? 
Piter moves forward.  The Baron sees a suculent piece of chicken skin on the table.  He picks up the plate, then the chicken skin. 
Leto's POV:  It's grown HAZY again.  The Baron is beginning to move away, reaching for the small piece of chicken skin.  Piter leans close to Leto. 
DUKE LETO Now! 
We hear a CRUNCH, hear a tumultuous RUSHING SOUND as Piter's face is pushed forcibly away.  The Baron is turning, a dumbfounded look on his face.  He drops the plate, and backs away. 
There is a tremendous ROARING.  Bits of visions of Caladan rush through Leto's ever-darkening consciousness --

PAUL Hurry! 
He jumps out of his seat. 
JESSICA Bring these satchels! 
She hands him one. 
PAUL (at doorway) Hurry -- This crashing may bring a worm. 
As Paul puts the satchel over his shoulder, he feels something.  He looks at his father's ring.  He stares at it silently, then closes his hand around it.  They jump outside.

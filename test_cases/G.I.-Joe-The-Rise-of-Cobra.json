{"train": "G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA \nWritten by \nStuart Beattie, John Lee Hancock, Brian Koppelman & David Levien \nNovember 3rd, 2007 \nDARKNESS. SILENCE. The following words sear onto screen: Whenever a new breed of evil emerges, a new breed of solider must fight it. \n-- GENERAL CLAYTON \"HAWK\" ABERNATHY \nEXT. THE BASTILLE - PARIS - NIGHT \nA HEAVY NIGHT MIST swirls around the imposing stone walls of the Bastille. PRISON GUARDS patrol outside with their pikes as the SCREAMS OF PRISONERS echo out the barred windows. \nSUPER: PARIS, 1641 \nINT. PRISON BLOCK - BASTILLE PRISON - NIGHT \nA pair of huge PRISON GUARDS walk down a row of filthy prison cells. Whimpering, starving PRISONERS appear and disappear in the flickering light of the wall torches. A large rat nibbles some stale bread in the corner, watching the guards. Finally, the two guards reach a cell whose PRISONER is not at all whimpering or starving. A huge Scotsman with a proud defiance in his eyes, a RED SQUARE MEDALLION dangling around his neck, glares through the bars. This is JAMES McCULLEN. The guards unlock his cell door, MATCHLOCK MUSKETS at the ready. McCullen stares at the muskets, unimpressed. He speaks with a thick Scottish brogue. \nMCCULLEN Still using matchlocks, are ya? I can get you a pair of flintlocks, you let me sneak out of here. Everyone else in this sequence speaks with a French accent. \nGUARD #1 \n(TEMPTED) Good ones? The other Guard glares at him. McCullen goes for the kill. \nMCCULLEN The best. From Spain. And perhaps a couple of pretty young ladies to teach you how to use them. Guard #1 is even more tempted, but his partner is a Loyalist. \nGUARD #2 On yer feet, you Scottish pig. \nINT. FURNACE - BASTILLE PRISON - NIGHT \nHuge, sweaty, bare-chested PRISON WORKERS mould something in a furnace, a large chunk of metal in their red hot tongs. The two prison guards muscle McCullen into the room and start to fasten him to a standing rack as a PRIEST begins reciting the Lord's Prayer in Latin. The Warden steps up and reads the charges off a SCROLL OF PAPER. \nWARDEN James McCullen, you have been found guilty of treason for the sale of military arms to the enemies of our Lord King Louis XIII... even whilst you sold arms to our Lord himself. \nMCCULLEN Your King is a vile bag of filth who murders his own allies. I should've charged him double. \nWARDEN You tried to overthrow the Crown in conspiracy with its enemies! \nMCCULLEN They offered me a Chancellorship, because unlike your simpleton King, they know that is the McCullen destiny, to run the wars, the true power, not simply to supply arms. \nWARDEN Do you have anything else to say before the sentence is carried out? \nMCCULLEN Yes, I do. Clan McCullen is far bigger and more powerful than any of you could ever imagine. My sons will continue to rise along after I am gone. As will their sons. And, God willing, their sons. \n(SMILES) It shall not end with my death. The Warden smiles back sinisterly. \nWARDEN Oh, we're not going to kill you, McCullen. We're going to make an example of you. \nThe Warden gives a nod to the prison workers who remove the METALLIC OBJECT from the fire. McCullen sees what it is before we do and his face fills with fear. It's a METAL MASK being carried towards him, the hinges open with a hideous creak. McCullen begins to struggle against the rack. \nWARDEN (CONT'D) So that no man, woman, nor child may ever see your treacherous face again, you shall wear this mask for the term of your natural life. The mask closes around his face. The workers melt the lock. McCullen SCREAMS. AND WE PUSH IN on the RED SQUARE MEDALLION. \nEXT. NATO HEADQUARTERS - BRUSSELS - DAY \nThe many flags of NATO flap outside its massive headquarters. \nSUPER: NATO HEADQUARTERS, BELGIUM \nMCCULLEN (V.0.) War used to be the exception. Now it is the new state of play, a constant, unavoidable... \nMCCULLEN (CONT'D) What's on your mind, General? \nHAWK Your warheads. Securing them in transit. Forty pairs of ears in that room now know the when and where. \nMCCULLEN Those \"ears\" all have top security clearance. \nHAWK We both know what that's worth. \nMCCULLEN Look, General, delivery is my responsibility and it's not one I take lightly. I had NATO assign an elite American Special Forces unit, a fully armored convoy with air support. I assure you, my warheads will be quite safe. \nHAWK I've made a career of showing up where I'm needed, whether ordered to or not. And if your warheads are half as effective as you say they are.. Then my unit is needed. \nMCCULLEN This is no time to play catch up. The NATO team's been drilling for weeks. They're lit up and ready to roll. \nHAWK My unit doesn't need mission specific training. They're chosen because of their ability to handle any situation. \nMCCULLEN Maybe next time, General... (moves to go, stops) What did you say your unit was called? \nHAWK I didn't. I just said they were always ready. McCullen continues on down the hall. Hawk gives Cover Girl a look, she reads it and nods. WE SMASH CUT TO: \nINT. HIGH-TECH DELIVERY BAY - MARS FACTORY - NIGHT \nA FOUR MAN SECURITY DETAIL escorts two LAB WORKERS as they enter a high-tech delivery bay and wlak past two \"COUGAR\" PATROL VEHICLES and a huge ARMORED \"GRIZZLY TRUCK, all armed with state-of-the-art rooftop weapons. FIFTEEN SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIERS stand at attention in front of Duke. \nDUKE All right, listen up, the Cougars will be front and back, Grizzly in the middle carrying the package. Minimum distance at all times. Choppers will cover us overhead. The Lab Workers step up. \nLAB WORKER #1 Captain Hauser. Duke turns to them and start signing forms as WALLACE \"RIPCORD\" WEEMS takes the case while a little short on academic credentials, Rip is long on confidence, charm, and courage. These two guys are as close as brothers, for better and for worse. Rip looks at the Lab Guy with a jokey grin. \nRIPCORD Not gonna explode, is it? \nLAB WORKER (dead serious) They're not weaponized yet. And the kill switches are attached to the launchers. All the same, I'd avoid potholes if I were you. Ripcord stares, then quickly hand the case off to another soldier. Duke shoots him a look and Ripcord shrugs, what? \nRIPCORD Why not stick it in a chopper and fly it out? If you want, I could-- \nDUKE --We have our orders. Okay, people! We're on the clock, let's move. \nRIPCORD \nMOUNT UP! Duke gives Rip another look. Rip throws him a cheesy grin. The team mounts up. The weapons case to Grizzly. ENGINES ignite. HEADLIGHTS beam. And the convoy rolls out. \nEXT. MARS FACTORY - KYRGYZSTAN - NIGHT \nThe convoy charges out of the heavily guarded factory gates, passing a sign: \"MILITARY ARMAMENTS RESEARCH SYNDICATE\". Two BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS swoop in and follow the convoy. \nINT. LEAD COUGAR - MARS FACTORY - NIGHT \nRipcord drives the lead Cougar, Duke beside him. Two more guys in back, remotely panning a rooftop DUAL MACHINE GUN. \nDUKE (into radio) Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog. We have the package and are on the dot to make Ganci Air Base ar 0900. \nRIPCORD You know, I hate all the Mother Goose, bird Dog crap, I just wish they'd let us say, \"Hey, Pete, it's Bill, see ya in a few.\" \nDUKE Not me, I joined up for the jargon. \nVOICE ON RADIO Roger that, Bird Dog. Mother Goose out. \nRIPCORD Just saying, you know, if I ran things... \nDUKE Rip, if you ran the Army we'd stay up all night, fill our canteen with tequila, and call each other \"Bro\". \nRIPCORD But we'd be badasses, right Bro? \nDUKE (with a sigh) Yeah, we'd be badasses. Eyes on the road, Rip. \nRIPCORD Hey, on the training run weren't there herders around here? This puts Duke instantly on the alert. \nEXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY \nToo late. CONCUSSION CANNONS slide out of ports on both sides of the dark shape. They fire simultaneously. The SUBATOMIC BLASTS punch into the front Blackhawk, crushing it like a beer can on your forehead. It explodes and drops. \nINT./EXT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY \nDuke and Rip see the hall of flaming metal crash in front of them, blocking the convoy's path. Rip hits the brakes. \nRIPCORD Jesus Christ! Bird Down! \nDUKE (urgent, but utterly calm) Back up! Back up! Back up! (into radio) Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog. We are under attack. Repeat --we are under attack! \nEXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY \nThe second Blackhawk pivots to see the dark shape, --it's like a giant helicopter without rotors, hovering on six JET THRUSTERS. It's a next-gen \"TYPHOON\" GUNSHIP. The Blackhawk hoses the Typhoon with its six-barrelled MINI- GUNS. But the rounds bounce off the Typhoon's angled armor. The CONCUSSION CANNONS fire at the second Blackhawk, catching it on the nose, crushing it into a flaming ball and sending it reeling ass-over-tail-rotor into the ground behind the rear Cougar, hemming in the convoy. The Grizzly launches two HEAT-SEEKING MISSILES off its roof- turret, but the Typhoon guns them down and fires again. The blast lands directly on top of the rear Cougar, literally flattening it as well as every tree within a hundred feet. \nINT./EXT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY \nDuke sees it all in his rear view mirror, yells into RADIO: \nDUKE Out! Everyone get out of the vehicles! Now! \nINT./EXT. GRIZZLY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY \nA final CONCUSSION BLAST lands between the last two vehicles now. Spinning the Grizzly. It's WINDOWS SHATTER and a thousand lethal GLASS SHARDS shoot inside, killing the drivers. The Cougar flips end over and lands in a ditch. \nINT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY \nDuke and Ripcord land on the upturned ceiling, beat to shit. Duke quickly checks on the two guys in back crushed to death where the blast caved in the Cougar's armor. He looks at Rip. \nDUKE You okay? \nRIPCORD \n(DAZED) Yeah, except for all the blood. Duke sees blood on the back of Rip's head. Then they hear a LOUD ROAR and turn to see the Typhoon hover by the Grizzly. \nRIPCORD (CONT'D) Who the hell is that? Duke grabs Ripcord and starts dragging him out. \nEXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY \nA SIDE DOOR on the Typhoon hisses open to reveal six \"VIPERS\", menacing foot soldiers clad head to toe in black BATTLE ARMOR, and armed with fearsome PULSE RIFLES. They exit the Typhoon and spread out to kill anyone left. The decimated Special Forces troops in the Grizzly OPEN FIRE with ASSAULT RIFLES, but the bullets can't penetrate the Viers' armor. The Vipers fire back, the impact from their pulse rifles crush the soldiers' bodies, armor and all, and fling them backwards. Two Soldiers pop two FRAGMENTATION GRENADES and toss them toward the Typhoon. The Vipers shoot one grenade out of the air with their pulse rifles. It EXPLODES well out of range as the other grenade lands on the ground int he middle of the pack. Another shot from a pulse rifle punches the grenade six feet underground. A DULL WHOOMP, lifts the ground by a foot. Meanwhile, another figure emerges out of the Typhoon. Long, slender legs in high black boots, the rest if her covered in black, form-fitting BODY ARMOR. She's beautiful, exotic, and most of all, lethal. She's known in certain circles only as \"THE BARONESS\" but we will know her as ANA. Her DARK GLASSES glint menacingly as she strides towards the Grizzly. The two Special Forces Soldiers who threw the grenades pop up to shoot her. But she quick-draws a pair of PULSE PISTOLS. BOOM! BOOM! The shots crush both soldiers. \nAna flips the pistols back into her holsters as a Viper blows the back door off the Grizzly, allowing her to climb inside. She blithely steps around the corpses and removes the WEAPONS \nCASE. Duke now has Rip ver his shouders and is running like hell. \nRIPCORD Duke? \nDUKE Shut up. \nRIPCORD If I die... \nDUKE You're not gonna die. \nRIPCORD I just want you to know... you never could run worth a damn. \nDUKE Jesus, Rip. \nRIPCORD I'm just saying, it's be nice if you could move a little faster. And that's when the Cougar blows, a concussive blast. Ana turns with the weapons case in time to see Duke and Rip go ass-over-teacups down into a ditch. She touches the stem of her glasses which ZOOM IN on Duke. DOWN IN THE DITCH: Duke rolls over and looks at Rip. \nDUKE Stay here. \nHAWK Hand over the weapons case son, and let us deliver the warheads. \nDUKE No way. I signed for 'em. My mission, my package. I carry them, I deliver them. Breaker's scanner BEEPS. He keys a button. The BEEPING promptly stops. He throws a look at Duke. \nBREAKER Wasn't hard, was it? \nDUKE Fine. But you seem to be a little short on transportation a the moment. Team Alpha will deliver you to me. \nDUKE (CONT'D) And where exactly are you, General? \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - DAY \nHawk stands in front of a HOLO-CAM amongst a sea of computers, Cover Girl behind him, Duke on a monitor. \nHAWK Come see for yourself. \nEXT. HOWLER - EGYPTIAN SKIES - DUSK \nThe Howler skims over the GIANT PYRAMIDS OF GIZA, a caravan of camels below. The aircraft continues out into the golden desert, too fast for anybody to get a good look at it. \nINT. HOWLER -SKIES - DUSK \nScarlett is cleaning Ripcord's head wound. \nRIPCORD Hey, you're cute. \nSCARLETT He's going into shock. \nRIPCORD What's your name, darlin'? \nSnake-Eyes stabs Ripcord hard int he arm with a drip-needle, Rip angrily eyeballs him and stifles a scream. \nSCARLETT I thought all the Special Ops guys were tough. \nRIPCORD We are tough ... . but also sensitive. (feeling the drugs) Whoa, that's some mucho primo stuff you gave me. Rip is high now, his eyes float up to Heavy Duty who stares back at him. Rip reaches out to touch his well-cropped hair. \nRIPCORD (CONT'D) .and a kung-fu grip. \nHEAVY DUTY The name's Heavy Duty. Duke has the weapons case on his lap. \nDUKE What kind of outfit is this? Not regular Army based on the accents. (to Scarlett) I have you as an Aussie... (looks to Heavy Duty) And you're a Johannesburger... (then Breaker) And you: French North Africa. Algiers? \nBREAKER Tunisia. Where were you born? \nRIPCORD Are you kidding me? Duke wasn't born, he was Government-Issued! \nDUKE But somehow you're all in the same unit. One you can't tell me the name of right? \nSCARLETT We'd get tossed for telling. \nRIPCORD Duke, Duke, don't you get it: they're super secret, they're Mission Impossible. This tape's gonna self-destruct in five-- \nDUKE --You're gonna go after them aren't you? The ones that hit my convoy. \n(SILENCE) Then whoever you are, whatever this unit is, I want in. \nBREAKER Not our call. Ripcord sits up, really woozy, looks at Scarlett. \nRIPCORD I want in too. That way we can spend some bunker time together. A SWORD suddenly slices across Rip's face, an inch away. It's Snake-Eyes, checking his blade, seemingly innocent. But the message is not lost on Ripcord. Scarlett looks at Duke. \nSCARLETT You two a team or something? \nRIPCORD We've been together forever. (off her look) But not like that. Hi, I'm Ripcord. \nHawk now leads the group into the Control Room where more TECHNICIANS man consoles. Duke still has the weapons case. \nCONTROL ROOM TECHNICIAN #1 Mr. McCullen's standing by, Sir. \nHAWK Patch him through, please. \nDUKE So who hit us out there? \nCOVER GIRL Currently unidentified. \nHEAVY DUTY And how'd that bitch in leather get a jump jet like ours? \nSCARLETT Whoever she is, she's clearly well- financed, with access to highly classified intel and state of the art weaponry. Their capabilities are beyond anything we've ever encountered. \nRIPCORD That's the reason we got our asses kicked. Duke betrays nothing. Hawk looks at him. \nHAWK We're going to need to find out everything we can about her. Knowing is half the battle. \nRIPCORD What's the other half? McCullen now appears next to Ripcord and walks through him. \nRIPCORD (CONT'D) Jesus! And we realize McCullen is here courtesy of a HOLO-PROJECTOR. A ring of cameras provides him with images of the Joes. \nHAWK Gentlemen, this is James McCullen, CEO of MARS Industries, the man who built these warheads. WE INTERCUT THIS SCENE WITH McCullen standing in front of a HOLO-CAM in a small room somewhere. THE HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGES of hawk, Duke, and the others around him. \nMCCULLEN General, most men I've encountered in this business over-promise and under-deliver. You're the opposite. Clearly, you were the security option I should have chosen. ON DUKE: Steaming behind his military demeanor. \nDUKE My team did everything we could out there. A lot of good men went down-- \nMCCULLEN --But not you. \nDUKE That mission was classified, sir. Clearly, somebody sold us out. \nMCCULLEN I've spent ten years and thirteen billion Euros creating these four warheads. Your job, Captain, was to protect them, and if it wasn't for General Hawk, you would've failed. \nHAWK That's not a fair assessment. He followed his orders to the letter. \nMCCULLEN Well that wasn't enough. Duke bristles. McCullen turns to Hawk. \nMCCULLEN (CONT'D) What are your coordinates? I'll have NATO send another special ops team to retrieve the warheads, company strength this time. \nHAWK Apologizes, Mr McCullen. It's not that I don't trust you...I don't trust anybody. \nMCCULLEN \n(SMILES) Are you sure you're not a McCullen? \nHAWK I don't talk smooth enough to be a McCullen. \nMCCULLEN You do just fine, General. Now, so the bastards who attacked you can't find you, you need to disable the tracking beacon hidden in the case. \nBREAKER We already have. \nMCCULLEN Good man. So, can I count on you to deliver the warheads to NATO now? \nHAWK I think it unwise to expose them at the moment. This group might make another attempt. \n(MORE) \nHAWK (CONT'D) We need to find and neutralize them before we can consider moving your weapons. \nMCCULLEN Alright. But allow me to check the warheads to see if any have been damaged. Duke begrudgingly sets the case down. Breaker turns on his suit's BALL-EYEPIECE. It goes into X-RAY MODE and we see the NANO-MITES crawling around inside the four warheads. \nMCCULLEN (CONT'D) Open it, please. \nTHE DOCTOR we've been very busy. He gestures to TWENTY MERCENARIES or various ethnicities, all standing at attention, not a single muscle moving among them. These are NEO-VIPERS. The baddest of the bad. \nMCCULLEN Is it working? \nTHE DOCTOR You tell me. The Doctor beckons a waiting LAB ASSISTANT who rolls out a glass case containing an eighteen foot long KING COBRA. the Doctor bends down and gazes at the snake. \nTHE DOCTOR (CONT'D) The King Cobra is a magnificent creature. Its venom can kill a full grown elephant with a single bite. He rattles the case and the cobra HISSES at him, revealing its hood. The Doctor steps up to a Neo-Viper and shows McCullen an INCISION SCAR behind the Neo-Vipers' right ears. \nTHE DOCTOR (CONT'D) We introduced into each subject one thousand cc's of the nano-mite solution. As expected, subjects became extremely ill and fell into a coma-like state for approximately forty hours. The Doctor produces a small HANDHELD DEVICE from his pocket, A FILE PHOTO of a Neo-Viper appears on the device's screen. \nTHE DOCTOR (CONT'D) When they returned to sentience, brain scans showed complete inactivity in the self-preservation region of the cortex. \nMCCULLEN English, Doctor. The Doctor keys a demand and that particular Neo-Viper steps up and sticks his bare arm into the case through a portal. \nTHE DOCTOR They feel no fear. The Neo-Viper grabs the cobra and squeezes, the cobra bites his arm, latching on, sinking its venom into his veins. The Neo-Viper doesn't even wince. \nTHE DOCTOR (CONT'D) Cortical nerve clusters revealed complete inactivity-- \nMCCULLEN --Doctor. \nTHE DOCTOR They feel no pain. The Doctor keys another command and the Neo-Viper obediently lets go of the cobra and removes his arm from the case. \nTHE DOCTOR (CONT'D) Frontal lobe concepts of morality are disengaged... No remorse... \nMCCULLEN And they are completely obedient? \nTHE DOCTOR Of course. .The real world applications are endless. \nThe Neo-Viper's knees give out. McCullen watches curiously. WE SMASH CUT INTO the NEO-VIPER'S BITE WOUND where the WHITE VENOM is racing through a blinding labyrinth of veins. \nTHE DOCTOR (V.0.) (CONT'D) The nano-mites will target the venom. STILL IN HIS VEINS we see hundreds of MICROSCOPIC NON-MITES rushing to meet the venom head on. Blocking it. Then swiftly pushing it back. All the way to the original fang holes. The venom seeps out of the holes and drips off the Neo-Viper's arm. He stands and returns to his place in line without a word. The Doctor looks at impressed McCullen. \nTHE DOCTOR (CONT'D) So you tell me: is it working? \nINT. CORRIDORS - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nThe Doctor follows McCullen through various corridors. \nTHE DOCTOR The science is staggering isn't it? \nMCCULLEN You've done well. You've thrown the caber clear out of the yard. \nTHE DOCTOR But research and science are expensive propositions. If I can make a suggestion..? McCullen stops and looks at him, there is something truly menacing and evil behind this Doctor's mask. \nTHE DOCTOR (CONT'D) Selling one batch of warheads on the black market could fund-- \nMCCULLEN --I appreciate your thirst for knowledge, Doctor. But this world is messy enough. Factions fighting and scrabbling for control, for resources, and it's only going to get worse as the century progresses. No. What the world needs is unification. Leadership. \n(MORE) \nMCCULLEN (CONT'D) It needs to be taken out of chaos by someone with complete control. He looks through a portal into a shadowy OPERATING CHAMBER, where a brilliant but vicious looking MAN is being scanned by SMART ROBOTS. This is ZARTAN. A Smart Robot begins to change Zartan's fingerprints, which we see on a monitor. \nMCCULLEN (CONT'D) My family was once this close to that kind of power... \n(LAUGHS) The French... Zartan CRACKS HIS KNUCKLES and gives McCullen a nod. McCullen looks back at the Doctor. \nMCCULLEN (CONT'D) Once I get my hands on the reins, the money will take care of itself. You'll be able to do all the research you want. McCullen strides off. The Doctor stares after him. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT \nDuke, still holding the briefcase, stares at a PHOTO OF ANA from the ambush, now up on a monitor. \nBREAKER We grabbed an image from Heavy- Duty's helmet cam. Ripcord looks stunned, he leans closer to Duke and whispers: \nDECOBRAY Steady progress. \nANA So the Minister of Defense was pleased? \nDECOBRAY He was. You know I wish I could tell you more... \nANA Of course. \nDECOBRAY You were gone a long time. How were the shops in Monte Carlo? \nANA I didn't get what I was after. They head up the stairs. \nDECOBRAY I suppose I should be grateful. \nANA Most husbands would be. \nDECOBRAY Most husbands don't have such mysterious wives, they know exactly where they are and what they do. \nANA \n(TEASING) They think they know. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - THE BARONESS' CASTLE - NIGHT \nAna throws open the double doors to her grand bedroom on a high floor with a view of the Eiffel Tower. \nANA I never get over how beautiful... \nDECOBRAY (staring at Ana) Neither do I. She spots Storm Shadow standing in an ante room and quickly spins to face her husband. She pulls Decobray close and kisses him. Storm Shadow makes a move, but ana warns him off with her eyes, She finishes the kiss and looks at Decobray. \nANA Let me change and freshen up and I'll meet you for dinner. \nDECOBRAY Of course. Decobray smiles at her and leaves. The smile falls from Ana's face as she spins around and heads for Storm Shadow. \nSTORM SHADOW Mr. McCullen gave me explicit orders to sever the Baron's spine if he so much as touched you. \nANA He's my husband, of course he touches me. Tell McCullen to grow up. Besides, the Baron says his work in the lab goes much better after we've... touched. And that's the important thing. \nSTORM SHADOW I'll be accompanying you to retrieve the warheads this time. Along with some of the men the Doctor's been working on. \nANA (with distaste) The Doctor. \nSTORM SHADOW We go at dawn. Storm Shadow turns and heads out through the doors. Ana Stands alone in her room now, she heads over to her dresser and opens a hidden drawer. Inside is a SMALL BOX. She opens it carefully and gazes at an ENGAGEMENT RING inside. Something sad and lonely in her eyes... And WE FLASHBACK TO: \nINT. MILITARY CLUB - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT \nA crowded military club. OFFICERS and ENLISTED dancing to an orchestra. And there's Ana, the most beautiful woman in the room. Wearing a black dress. Slightly younger and with none of the cold viciousness she displayed earlier. She's dancing with Duke who's wearing his officer's DRESS UNIFORM, replete with bars and medals. She laughs as Duke whispers something in her ear. She's in love. And so is he. Ripcord is in a booth, downing shots with four ENLISTED WOMEN. He has his arms around two of them and looks loaded. \nRIPCORD My hot tub only holds four. \n(COUNTS) No, five. \nEXT. VERANDAH - OFFICER'S CLUB - FLASHBACK - NIGHT \nDuke leads Ana outside onto a quiet verandah, the lights of Washington shimmering beyond them. He suddenly kneels down in front of her, an ENGAGEMENT RING in a box in his hand. Ana gasps with shock and joy, tears welling in her eyes. \nDUKE I've been wanting to do this before we deploy. \nANA Duke...it's beautiful. It's too nice you lunatic. \nDUKE Only time I'm buying one of these, so why not? They stare a each other, a touching beat. Then Duke screws up his face, worried? \nDUKE (CONT'D) Well, what do you say? She's too emotional to speak. And then they hear: \nINT. MCCULLEN'S \nOFFICE- DESTRO \nHEADQUARTERS \n- DAY opening. Ana McCullen gazes a the IRON MASK we and Storm Sh saw his ance adow watc in the h onndual HOLOstor \nPROJECTORS. This belonged jo E mine. He was c t an old ancestor o f to both sides. aught sellin g arms They forced wear it the rest to his life . \nANA Why do you keep at it? So that I MCCULLENne ver forget the most important rul e in dealing arms. Never sell to STORM SHADOWboth sides? \nMCCULLEN Never get caught. McCullen carefully puts the mask back in its ca se. \nCONT'D) Take the warheads N ( to them wea Paris. Have ized. Then to test pon one. I want you Test one?ANA \nMCCULLEN I don't wan t you until leaving Paris that they've you;re sure that the work, been properly y weaponized. \n(SMILES) We'll let CNN show everyone how w ell they perform. (loses the smile) I want them to fear me. It will be STORM SHADOWdone. \nMCCULLEN I have a target french will never in mind, one the forget. \n(MORE) \nMCCULLEN (CONT'D) As I have never forgotten what the French did to Clan McCullen. \nINT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY \nIn the shadowy operating chamber, the Doctor approaches Zartan who sits on a gurney, scanning his PDA. Dozens of SMART ROBOTS warm up as the Doctor flicks on switches. \nTHE DOCTOR Are you ready, Mr. Zartan? \nZARTAN This is going to be the achievement of a lifetime. \nTHE DOCTOR For you and me both. \nZARTAN Eighteen months of studying the subject, learning the mannerisms, adopting his eating habits, losing sixty percent of my muscle mas... \nTHE DOCTOR Your commitment has been inspiring. McCullen enters. \nMCCULLEN Gentlemen. About to get under way? Zartan raises his PDA. \nZARTAN Once the ledgers are all square. \nMCCULLEN Check your account. Zartan checks the PDA. McCullen shakes his head. \nMCCULLEN (CONT'D) It's always about the money. \nZARTAN It's a useful tool. You should understand that. Ah! The transfer just hit my account. Zartan puts the PDA aside, leans back on the gurney and \nCRACKS HIS KNUCKLES. \nZARTAN (CONT'D) Let's do this. The Doctor straps Zartan down, then starts the SMART ROBOTS which converge on Zartan, injecting his body with dozens of long needles. He remains conscious, not feeling any pain. WE ZOOM into a LARGE NEEDLE which OPENS an INCISION behind his right ear. The needle feeds thousands of tiny NANO-MITES into Zartan's head. Zartan's eyes bulge, he starts to SCREAM and fight his restraints as the nano-mites begin to reshape his appearance, reforming facial bones and changing the texture and elasticity of his skin and even changing the color of his eyes. The Doctor grins proudly. McCullen looks disturbed. \nINT. URBAN AREA - THE PIT - DAY \nJoes are busy cleaning up the mess. Snake-Eyes sits by himself, hasn't moved in several hours. A thousand yard stare in his eyes. AND WE FLASHBACK TO: \nEXT. A DRIZZLING SAIGON ALLEY - NIGHT \nA TEN YEAR OLD FRENCH ORPHAN BOY, cold from the rain and desperately hungry, scavenges for food in a garbage can, he looks up and notices a warm light coming from the other side of a wall and gate MARKED WITH RED CLAN MARKINGS. INSIDE THE TEMPLE: Young Snake Eyes sneaks in through the Kitchen window and goes to a rice pot on the counter. As he takes a first bite, another young boy enters, we see the RED CLAN MARKINGS on his forearm, it's a young Storm Shadow, healthy, wealthy, and well fed. \nYOUNG STORM SHADOW Thief ! He picks up the KITCHEN KNIFE and tries to cut Young Snake- Eyes, who blocks the strike with the rice pot. They fight fiercely for two little kids, using all sorts of utensils and furniture. Snake-Eyes has desperate street skills, but Storm Shadow's classic training gives him the edge. He finally traps Snake-Eyes under his foot, a triumphant look on his face. He starts to choke Snake-Eyes with his foot ... \nHAWK Can you kill her? And then WE FLASHBACK TO: Ana strangling Scarlett, a smile on her face. Squeezing harder, harder. Pure evil. \nDOCTOR (V.0.) \n(PRELAP) That ought to hold you. \nINT. MEDICAL WING - DAY \nDuke \"comes to\" as the Doctor finishes and walks away. Duke takes a breath, looks to Hawk in his bed, then stands and walks over. He stares down at Hawk, then, a promise-- \nDUKE Graveyard dead. \nINT. MEDICAL EXAMINATION ROOM - THE PIT - DAY \nDuke, Ripcord, Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, and Heavy Duty stare at some next-gen computerized ultra-sound PHOTOSTATS of a dead Neo-Viper. Snake-Eyes points in question to an area. \nSCARLETT Nano-mites. I wrote my thesis on the theory behind them at Oxford. They've been surgically implanted behind the ear, all programmed to accomplish different tasks. \nDUKE Like what? \nSCARLETT Theoretically, the possibilities are endless. Increase their speed, agility, resilience. You program, they perform. That's the genius of nanotechnology, it can do pretty much whatever you want it to. \nDUKE Mind control? \nSCARLETT I don't see why not. \nINT. CORRIDOR - THE PIT - DAY \nDuke and Ripcord move with the others through a corridor. \nDUKE Their weaponry, financing, intel, it has to be McCullen. Doing an inside job on his own warheads. \nSCARLETT You may be right. Maybe he needed NATO to pay for his R D. \nRIPCORD The weapons case! Everyone stops and looks at Ripcord like he's nuts. \nRIPCORD (CONT'D) Remember he had us open the case for him. Remember that? \nSCARLETT What about it? \nRIPCORD I'll bet that code he gave us like re-activated the tracking beacon or something. Looks pass among the group, it starts to make sense. \nDUKE And who says you're not a thinker. All of the sudden, Breaker rushes up to them, out of breath. \nBREAKER I think I found her... \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - DAY \nBreaker leads the group into the control room where a WEDDING PHOTO OF ANA AND DeCobray is up on screen. Duke stares at the photo, gazing at her face. Ripcord sees her and knows, too. \nDUKE Yeah, you found her all right. \nBREAKER Her name is Ana DeCobray now, Baroness if you're feeling formal. \nRIPCORD Wow, she traded up, huh? (off Duke's look) I mean... financially. \nDUKE Who is he? \nBREAKER Baron DeCobray. Big shot French scientist. Runs a lab in Paris. \nSCARLETT Lab? Breaker call up an image of DeCobray standing in front of a huge PARTICLE ACCELERATOR along with some other scientists. \nBREAKER Particle accelerator. \nEXT. PARIS - FRANCE - DAY \nParis by day, the Eiffel Tower in all her glory. \nEXT. GUARD SHED - LABORATORY - DAY \nAna's SCARAB ATTACK TRUCK pulls up to a GUARD SHED outside a large building which is surrounded by an ELECTRIFIED FENCE. A SECURITY GUARD steps out of the shed and taps on the driver's window. The Neo-Viper behind the wheel lowers the BACKSEAT WINDOW, revealing Ana and Storm Shadow in the back. The guard smiles at Ana. They speak in French, subtitled. \nSECURITY GUARD Good Morning. Baroness. \nANA Good morning. Gene. My husband's expecting me. \nSECURITY GUARD Absolument. The Security Guard opens the ELECTRONIC GATE and the Scarab drives up to the building. \nINT. FOYER - LABORATORY - DAY \nTwo SECURITY GUARDS look up from their desks as Ana and Storm Shadow stride through the DOORS with two Neo-Vipers. Storm Shadow throws something. Both guards fall dead. THROWING STARS in their heads. The Neo-Vipers steal behind the desk, throw a switch, open a LOCKED DOOR for Ana and Storm Shadow. \nINT. PARTICLE ACCELERATOR CHAMBER - LABORATORY - DAY \nAna and Storm Shadow enter a colossal chamber which is all but consumed by the PARTICLE ACCELERATOR. \nLAB TECHNICIANS swarm all over it, taking readings and making adjustments, under the eyes of DeCobray who sits at a control station surrounded by monitors. Ana gives the weapons case to Storm Shadow who hangs back as she walks up to her husband. \nDECOBRAY Ana...? \nANA I need you to do something for me and I don't have much time. \nDECOBRAY (sees Storm Shadow) Who is this? She beckons Storm Shadow who sets the weapons case down on DeCobray's desk, opening it up to reveal the four NANOTECH WARHEADS and their launchers. DeCobray stares, bewildered. \nDECOBRAY (CONT'D) I don't understand... what are these things? What's going on? \nANA They're warheads, dear. And I need you to weaponize them for me... (looking around) .or we'll kill everyone in here. DeCobray stares at her, shocked. He looks at Storm Shadow who removes a GLOCK PISTOL from his belt and shoots a TECHNICIAN. Chaos erupts. DeCobray shouts to the room, calming the others somewhat. He stares at Ana and Storm Shadow, terrified. \nDECOBRAY This is a civilian laboratory. We don't have the correct programming protocols for weaponizing... \nANA The protocols are in the case. (he hesitates) I told you, I don't have much time. DeCobray reluctantly takes the weapons case. \nEXT. BRAWLER - CITY STREETS - DAY \nA BRAWLER charges through the streets. On the outside it looks like your Uncle's R.V, but inside it's all next-gen. \nINT. BRAWLER - LABORATORY - DAY \nHeavy Duty drives the Brawler while Breaker mans a hi-tech terminal next to him. In the back, Snake-Eyes loads his guns while Scarlett, Duke, and Ripcord put on ACCELERATOR SUITS. \nSCARLETT Heavy D and Breaker will stay in the Brawler, watch our back. The rest of us will break into the lab with the accelerator suits. Once the warheads are weaponized, they'll be extremely volatile. We can't afford to let any of them go off inside the city. Ripcord looks at Snake-Eyes. \nRIPCORD What about you? Don't you get a suit? Snake-Eyes just looks at him, \"Are you kidding me?\" \nSCARLETT He doesn't need one. \nINT. PARTICLE ACCELERATOR CHAMBER - LABORATORY - DAY \nA TREMENDOUS WHINE echoes through the chamber as the particle accelerator come to life, HUMMING evenly. Storm Shadow backs up a little. Ana glances at him. He shrugs, what? Technicians quickly finish up and back away from the accelerator. \nDECOBRAY Firing. DeCobray hits a switch. The PARTICLE ACCELERATOR charges and begins hurling atoms through miles and miles of underground tunnels. Inside the accelerator, the four warheads begin to spin in a GLASS VACUUM CHAMBER -- then, as the power grows, they begin to rise, each one hovering as they spin. Ana and Storm Shadow watch with mild curiosity as the noise inside the chamber builds. The atoms catapulting faster and faster through the tunnels, bombarding the warheads again and again. Until finally, a LOUD BOOM rings out. And the warheads slowly sink back down and stop spinning. DeCobray keys another button and the GLASS VACUUM CHAMBER emerges from the accelerator. \nTechnicians open the chamber and very carefully remove the warheads, returning them to their case. Storm Shadow locks the case and picks it up. \nDECOBRAY (CONT'D) Careful... they're alive. \nANA Thank you, Leon. \nMcCullen watching Breaker and Ripcord through the dead Neo- Viper's eyes on a screen. He turns to the Doctor urgently. \nMCCULLEN Destroy that unit immediately. The Doctor removes his PDA and taps a key to draw up the Neo- Viper's file. He clicks a button that reads \"TERMINATE\". \nEXT. CITY STREETS - DAY \nInstantly, the Neo-Viper's body snaps rigid and begins to shake. Everyone gets a shock. Backing up. \nHEAVY DUTY He's still alive! \nSCARLETT He's not alive. \nHEAVY DUTY You ever seen a dead guy do that? \nSCARLETT They activated a self-destruct. The Neo-Viper's body starts to decay before them. Thousands of NANO-MITES literally eating away at his flesh and bones. \nBREAKER Nano-mites! \nRIPCORD They're eating him! \nSCARLETT Hurry, Breaker! But the NANO-MITES are too fast. The Neo-Viper's legs are now gone. His chest and arms next. Breaker rapidly scans through the MEMORY FLASHES. But now the NANO-MITES consume his head. \nBREAKER \nNOW \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - MARS HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nMcCullen watches Breaker's frantic face suddenly disappear on his screen. He gives the Doctor a smile. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nBreaker looks crestfallen at the empty Neo-Viper suit in his arms. Ripcord kneels beside him, stunned and bereft. \nRIPCORD You did the best you could. \nBREAKER Relax, I got it. \nRIPCORD You got it? \n(CONFUSED) Well, what was the \"NOO!\" for? \nBREAKER That was for McCullen. There is the sound of weapons being raised. The team looks to see they are surrounded by FRENCH POLICE and PARATROOPERS. \nFRENCH SWAT CAPTAIN (in French) Put your hands in the air! The Joes trade looks, shrug and raise their hands. \nRIPCORD (under his breath) We don't have time for this. \nSCARLETT It's agains friendly for t orders to engage with ces. \nRIPCORD The onl about i Dukendly force I care \nS Ripcord suddenly S Forces' heads.

She taps the bonds on his wrists. \nANA I should've thought of this before. They almost share a smile. \nDUKE Let me get this straight. You're with McCullen. You're married to that Baron. And you claim you're still in love with me. \nANA I'm a complex woman. \nDUKE Maybe you just don't know who you are anymore. \nANA Who I was died long ago. \nDUKE No, this isn't you, I still see the person I loved behind your eyes. Her eyes soften for a moment. \nANA Tell me what she was like. \nDUKE She was smart, and funny. She was loyal as hell. She loved those she was close with, me, her brother... (agonized pause) I did my best. With Rex. I'm sorry. He was my responsibility. I should have... It's why I left, Ana. Why I couldn't be with you. You were in so much pain... I thought the sight of me just give you more. She seems to be affected by this ever so slightly, then... a hard, cold look comes to her eyes, she shakes her head. \nANA It doesn't matter now. \nDUKE No, it matters very much. We have the chance to make things right. \nANA Nothing will ever be right again. Duke stares at her, his heart ripped apart. WE PUSH IN ON the two of them and FLASHBACK TO: \nEXT. CEMETERY - WASHINGTON D.C. - FLASHBACK - DAY \nRain is drizzling on a military cemetery. Ana sits alone, without family, without Duke, staring straight ahead as Rex's casket is lowered into the ground. Parked on a nearby road is a lone car. Duke sits inside it, staring at the funeral in the distance. His face tells us the anguish he's living with. He pulls out and starts to drive away, the rain on the windshield BLURS AS WE DISSOLVE \nTO: \nINT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - POLAR ICE CAP - NIGHT \nThe Night Raven zeroes down on a stretch of ice near a huge CAVE. A SET OF RUNWAY LIGHTS appear under the ice, guiding it in for a smooth landing. The cave swallows the plane whole. \nINT. ICE CAVE - NIGHT \nThe Night Raven rolls to a stop inside the cave. The side door opens. Storm Shadow exits with the weapons case. Ana leads Duke out, two Neo-Vipers behind them. Storm Shadow clicks a hand held remote and a HIDDEN ICE WALL opens to reveal a HI-TECH DIVING BELL awaiting them. Duke uses the moment to lunge forward, grab the case and haul ass towards the cave door. Storm Shadow spins, Shurikan throwing stars in his hands. The Neo-Vipers whip up their pulse rifles. \nANA NO! McCullen has plans for him! Storm Shadow throws a star, it whistles across the cave and nails Duke in his shoulder, Duke goes down hard, staggers back up, but the Neo-Vipers are already on him, they start beating the living shit out of him. Ana jogs up. \nANA (CONT'D) Enough! Storm Shadow picks up the case and looks at Duke, face down, bloody and beaten. \nSTORM SHADOW And what was your plan? Run three thousand miles across the ice? He rips his star out of Duke's shoulder. Duke sucks it up. \nSTORM SHADOW (CONT'D) Stupid soldier. Duke rolls over and stares up at them, breathing hard. \nINT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT \nRipcord, Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, Heavy Duty and Breaker are in the conn tower of a next-gen submarine, going over a 3-D MAP of the polar ice cap. \nHEAVY DUTY That's a lotta ice. \nTHE DOCTOR (interrupting, re: Duke) --Another \"recruit\"? \nMCCULLEN Albeit a rather unwilling one. The Doctor's nano-mites can control all manner of brain functions. When you wake up, you'll be working for me, and your past will be a distant shimmer that floats in and out of your mind like a leaf on a breeze. \nTHE DOCTOR I'll prepare him for the surgery. The Doctor beckons the Neo-Vipers who shove Duke after him towards another door. Duke and Ana exchange one last look. McCullen keeps his eyes on her as she watches him go. \nEXT. DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - UNDERWATER - DAY \nA school of fish swims past the facility, one fish breaks away from the school. CAMERA ZOOMS IN TIGHT ON IT: it's not a fish at all, but a mini robotic underwater spy system. \nEXT. SUBMARINE - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nA sleek submarine drifts silently through the arctic waters. \nBREAKER (V.0.) Picture's coming on line now. \nINT. CONN TOWER - SUBMARINE - DAY \nIn the Conn Tower of the sub, our team gathers around Breaker who sits at a monitor watching what the \"fish\" is watching. \nSCARLETT It's an underwater facility... \nHEAVY DUTY McCullen's home away from home. \nRIPCORD Dukes' gotta be in there somewhere. \nSCARLETT Wait, what's that? Breaker ZOOMS IN on a massive TURBO-LASER CANNON. \nBREAKER Oh, Jesus...That's an automated, phased array turbo-pulse battery. (off their looks) A really big gun. \nSCARLETT Could it take out our sub? \nBREAKER That thing could take out a dozen subs simultaneously. \nSCARLETT Then that's our first objective. \nRIPCORD No, no. Duke's our first objective. \nSCARLETT The main force can't attack as long as that cannon's online. \nHEAVY DUTY How you figure getting it offline? Snake-Eyes points to the DIVING BELL CABLES n the monitor. \nSCARLETT Elevator cables. They've got a surface entrance. Shipwreck? She turns to the submarine commander, HECTOR \"SHIPWRECK\" DELGADO, a fiery Spanish naval combat veteran. \nSHIPWRECK Going up, senorita? Scarlett nods and leads the others down a corridor. \nSCARLETT Snake-Eyes, Breaker, Ripcord, and I will infiltrate the factory from above and destroy the cannon. Heavy D, as soon as we give the word, you lead the assault from outside. \nHEAVY DUTY (nods grimly) Go, Joes... \nEXT. ICE FIELD - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY \nA quiet wind blows across a remote stretch of arctic ice. All of a sudden the ice pack begins to tremble like the mother of all earthquakes. It cracks and ruptures and then erupts as the CONN TOWER of the submarine crashes through, then grinds to a halt. A FORWARD HATCH OPENS and two ROCK SLIDES launch out, landing hard on the ice and speeding away. Ripcord and Breaker on one. Scarlett and Snake-Eyes on the other. \nINT. LAUNCH BAY- DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nMcCullen, Ana, and Storm Shadow watch monitors showing TECHNICIANS securing the warheads onto three rocket propelled SMART-DRONES. As the last one is secured a Technician says: \nTECHNICIAN All drones prepared and ready, Sir. \nMCCULLEN Good, commence the launch sequence immediately. is that a ripple of concern flickering across Ana's face? \nINT./EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY \nEXT. NIGHT RAVEN - ICE CAVE - DAY \nThe NIGHT RAVEN tears across the ice and launches into the sky. Ripcord WHOOPS with adrenaline. Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, and Breaker fast rope down into the first launch bay as the ice REFORMS behind them, hiding the hole. \nINT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nWe now find Duke, wearing only SURGICAL TROUSERS, strapped on the operating gurney we saw Zartan on earlier. The SMART ROBOTS warming up around him as the Doctor approaches. \nTHE DOCTOR The atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima destroyed seventy percent of the city. Seventy percent... Did you know that, Duke? \nDuke looks at him, something familiar. \nREX There was a bank situated less than one hundred yards from Ground Zero, destroyed of course. Only one thing survived. It's four bank vaults. And when those vaults were opened, they discovered everything inside them had survived completely unscathed. \nDUKE Who are you? \nTHE DOCTOR Of course, the vault I took shelter in wasn't that well-made. He unclips his BREATHING TUBES and lowers the mask to reveal a scarred and burned face. \nTHE DOCTOR (CONT'D) Double Bubble? Duke is beyond shocked. \nDUKE Rex... Rex immediately has trouble breathing and returns the mask over his face. \nDUKE (CONT'D) You sonuvabitch... Ana buried you. \nTHE DOCTOR A moving ceremony, I'm sure. The three volley salute. The flag on the coffin. \nDUKE Why? .Why didn't you come in...? \nTHE DOCTOR Because I found out the truth... \nAND WE FLASHBACK TO: JUNGLE BUILDING - DAY Rex moves through the building with Fireteam Bravo. \nBRAVE SOLDIER Intel says the lab's in the basement. Fireteam Bravo kicks open a door. They lead the way down a staircase toward the basement. Rex follows, nervous as hell. The soldiers round a corner, suddenly, Rex hears GUNFIRE, he freezes, then silence, Rex pulls out his .45 And rounds the corner to see Fireteam Bravo down. A GUARD is trying to clear a jam in his machine gun. As he clears the weapon and raises it, Rex raises his .45 and fires first. The Guard drops. Rex checks Bravo, but they're not moving. He looks around the basement, no lab, but he sees a massive VAULT DOOR, closed. He heads for the vault, 45 raised, breathing hard. WHOOSH, a blast of refrigerated air hits him as he opens the door. Rex enters a small room filled with DEAD ANIMALS in huge FORMALDEHYDE JARS> Something inside the animals is constantly reshaping their appearances, reforming their facial bones and changing the color, texture and elasticity of their skins. There is a scuffling noise, Rex points his gun. A small, stooped old SCIENTIST in a lab coat appears. \nSCIENTIST Are you going to shoot me?... Rex doesn't respond. \nSCIENTIST (CONT'D) We knew you were coming. But I couldn't walk away from it... Rex stares in awe, not what he was expecting. \nREX Stay where you are. His gun up, he finds a COMPUTER TERMINAL and begins accessing various files, starts reading them. \nREX (CONT'D) These aren't chemical or nuclear-- \nSCIENTIST No. Something much... better. \nRES This is beyond anything... This is light years ahead of anyone in the field. \nSCIENTIST You see why I couldn't leave. Rex nods, hypnotized by the science in front of him, an instant bond formed with the man who created it. The distant sound of Jets. The Scientist moves to the vault door and begins pulling it closed as we hear the J-Dam Bunker Buster whistling towards them. \nSCIENTIST (CONT'D) If we live, I'll show you everything... \nWE SMASH CUT BACK TO THE MEDICAL WING - PRESENT Duke tries to absorb what he's learned. The Doctor continues. \nTHE DOCTOR The man who created this technology was not our enemy. In fact, he was hired by our very own government to create it. When it was deemed too unethical, they sent us to kill him. He didn't survive the blast. But I... lived. (touches his face) And I escaped with his research. Unfortunately I tested it on myself first, and lost my lungs and vocal chords in the process. But now I've perfected it, and you will get a first-hand experience. \nDUKE (his biggest concern) Does Ana know about this, about you? \nTHE DOCTOR No... and she never will. He glances at the SMART ROBOTS and Duke realizes. \nDUKE You sick bastard... you did this to your own sister? \nTHE DOCTOR \n(INCENSED) I loved my sister! Do you have any idea the state she was in? Me dead. You AWOL. Depression, drugs. \nOutside, the massive TURBO-LASER swings wildly towards the submarine and fires. A BRILLIANT BLUE PULSE ripples through the arctic sea, glancing the side of the vessel. WHAM!! \nINT. CONN TOWER - DAY \nThe submarine shakes hard. Rivets burst. Water pours in. \nSHIPWRECK The hull's been ruptured! \nHEAVY DUTY Everyone into the attack boats! \nEXT. SUBMARINE - DAY \nHatches open along the sides of the submarine, deploying ten SHARC ATTACK CRAFT carrying dozens of Joes. At the same time, batches begin to open on the facility and a dozen MANTIS attack craft carrying dozens of Neo-Vipers emerge. \nINT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY \nHeavy Duty and Shipwreck pilot one of the SHARCS. The huge opposing force coming at them is quite terrifying. \nHEAVY DUTY Keep tight everybody. He fires a HARPOON TORPEDO which BLASTS a Mantis. The mantis craft RETURN FIRE. The whole area explodes in a pulse fire and harpoon blasts. The Joe submarine sinks and EXPLODES at the base of the facility. \nINT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY \nDuke cuddles dead Ana, clearly emotional. McCullen steps up. \nMCCULLEN Is she still alive? \nTHE DOCTOR For now. \nMCCULLEN You said this couldn't happen. \nTHE DOCTOR I didn't think it could. I've never seen anyone defeat the programming, even momentarily. Duke recovers and angrily grabs one of Ana's PISTOLS and kills the two Neo-Vipers, then turns the gun on the others. The Doctor lifts his PDA, finger on the \"TERMINATE\" BUTTON. \nTHE DOCTOR (CONT'D) If I press this, Ana dies. \nDUKE Put it down. \nTHE DOCTOR Your choice, Duke. \nDUKE Put it down! The Doctor doesn't move. McCullen watches the stand-off his right hand discreetly drawing STEEL HOSE out from his sleeve. \nINT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY \nRipcord streaks into the upper atmosphere in the Night Raven, the curve of the Earth visible out his windows. Ahead, he can see a PULSATING LIGHT. \nRIPCORD I see it, dead ahead. \nINT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOL - DAY \nBreaker speaks into his headset. \nBREAKER You have to knock it down before it re-enters the atmosphere so the nano-mites don't reach the ground. \nINT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY \nRipcord flicks a switch and opens a PULSE LASER on the nose. \nRIPCORD Uh, I've got a problem. The fire controls are not in here. \nBREAKER'S VOICE What do you mean, not in there? \nRIPCORD I mean I can't see them anywhere! \nINT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY \nINT. PRESIDENTIAL BUNKER - DAY \nThe American President's Bodyguards rush him and his staff down into a fortified bunker beneath the White House. \nPRESIDENT How soon will it strike the city? \nSTAFFER Seventeen minutes, Sir. \nPRESIDENT This will be a disaster the likes of which we have never seen. As the DOORS CLOSE behind them we see the MARS INDUSTRIES LOGO on the doors. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - DAY \nAnother blast from the TURBO-LASER destroys a SHARC. \nINT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY \nHeavy Duty sees this as he takes out a MANTIS. \nSHIPWRECK That cannon's going to kill us all. \nHEAVY DUTY My guy will take care of it, trust me. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - ENERGY SHAFT - DAY \nSnake-Eyes kills the Neo-Viper, who falls down a large shaft into freezing waters. Storm Shadow lunges at Snake-Eyes and the two of them tumble down into the shaft, but land on a gangway. They both leap up and begin to fight again. The Neo- Viper tries to crawl out of the freezing water, seemingly unfazed as he slowly freezes solid. \nAll of a sudden, there's LOUD NOISES and a series of ENERGY LASERS power on up and down the shaft between various circuit modules. This is where the energy is charged to operate the cannon. One of the lasers catches Storm Shadow's shoulder and burns him severely. Snake-Eyes sees this and ducks just as an ENERGY LASER fires on beside his head. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - DAY \nOutside, the TURBO-LASER fires. The Joe craft desperately weave and dodge. \nINT. ENERGY SHAFT - DAY \n.and the LASER NET fades. Instantly, Storm Shadow and Snake- Eyes continue their desperate fight. Swords FLASH and CLANG, two masters at their best. AND WE FLASH CUT TO: THE GROUNDS OF THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE, where two twenty-two year olds, Storm Shadow and Snake-Eyes sword fight. Storm Shadow knocks Snake-Eyes to the ground again and places his steel sword against Snake-Eyes' face. Again, Hard Master watches without expression. AND WE FLASH CUT BACK TO: THE ENERGY SHAFT, where Storm Shadow slashes Snake-Eyes across the chest, but before he can finish him off, the cannon charges up again and the LASER NET slams on. Storm Shadow twists his body to avoid the ENERGY LASERS while Snake- Eyes lifts himself up to his toes to avoid a laser that threatens to disintegrate his crotch. Storm Shadow sees this, grins to himself. \nINT. PRESIDENTIAL BUNKER - DAY \nA staffer is on the phone, looking up at the President. \nSTAFFER It seems somebody's shot down the warhead heading for Moscow. \nPRESIDENT Thank God... As he says this, a SECRET SERVICE AGENT draws a SILENCED PISTOL and kills the other Agents and Staff. We see an INCISION SCAR behind his right ear and realize he is a Neo- Viper. The President stares, stunned and horrified. The Neo- Viper holds his pistol on the President as-- \n--A BOOKCASE moves on the wall, revealing a secret room. An UNSEEN FIGURE emerges and the President stares in shock. \nINT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY \nUp in the skies, Ripcord spots the second drone rocketing down towards the lower atmosphere in front of him. \nRIPCORD Second drone in my sights. \nINT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY \nBreaker and Scarlett watch in the control room. \nBREAKER Hurry, Rip. You've only got thirty seconds before it enters the lower atmosphere. \nINT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY \nRipcord's feeling the pressure. He targets the missile. \nRIPCORD Taine! But nothing happens. Scarlett's voice yells in his head. \nBREAKER He's taking the nano-mites back up into the upper atmosphere. \nINT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY \nThe Night Raven is breaking up all around Ripcord now. He quickly attaches his flight helmet's BREATHING MASK. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nRipcord turns the plane over, inverting it. \nRIPCORD Cur magh! The canopy explodes. Rip shoots back down into the atmosphere as the NANO-MITES devour the Night Raven, then float away... \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nThey see this on their screens. \nBREAKER He did it... He actually did it... \nSCARLETT Ripcord? Talk to me...Ripcord! Still nothing. And now they begin to suspect the worst. Then: \nRIPCORD'S VOICE I asked you not to yell at me. Relief comes rushing back to Scarlett and Breaker. \nSCARLETT What happened? Are you okay? \nRIPCORD'S VOICE Yeah, did it work? \nSCARLETT Yes...yes, it worked. \nEXT. PARACHUTE - SKIES - DAY \nRipcord smiles, parachuting down towards Washington. \nRIPCORD (into headset) Good...cause I think I'm about to get arrested. \nEXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY \nRipcord lands on the White House lawn, holding his hands up benignly as dozens of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS surround him. \nINT. ENERGY SHAFT - DAY \nENERGY LASERS pulse on again, almost catching the two ninjas in their fight. Snake-Eyes draws his KATANA SWORD, its blade shimmering in the laser-light as he redirects the laser back into its module. Storm Shadow does the same with his sword, barely saving his neck. They glare at each other. AND WE FLASH CUT TO THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE, where the two 26 year-olds fight with katanas. Storm Shadow presses forward, Snake-eyes side-steps and hurls Storm Shadow to the ground! He steps up and puts his sword tip in Storm Shadow's eye. Snake-Eyes first ever win over Storm Shadow. Hard Master CLAPS ONE TIME. Storm Shadow looks at his father, he can't believe it, his father seems happy for Snake-Eyes. He slaps the sword away, gets up and stalks off. FLASH BACK TO: The cannon fires and the lasers disappear, freeing them to continue their duel. This is it. The final duel. Snake-Eyes struggles, exhausted and wounded. Storm Shadow puts in every ounce of hate he has left. He finally tears Snake-Eyes' sword away and kicks him down. About to go for the final kill. But before we find out the climax to their fight, we must finish their story: ON THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE GROUNDS, Snake-Eyes, still 26, walks along the pond. He hears a LOUD CRY. Snake-Eyes breaks into a run, careens around a building and sees Hard Master slumped on the ground, a sword in his back. \nSNAKE-EYES Master! Other NINJAS come flooding in. \nNINJA #1 That's Storm Shadow's sword! \nNINJA #2 There! There's the murderer! \nSnake-Eyes spins to see Storm Shadow climb up the side of the Temple, onto the rood, give him a last look, and jump down over the wall. FLASH BACK TO: THE ENERGY SHAFT where Snake- Eyes is suddenly filled with renewed energy, he stares up at Storm Shadow's katana blade poised for the final kill. \nSTORM SHADOW You took your vow of silence to avenge our Master. But now you will die without a word. The LOUD NOISE gears up again, distracting Storm Shadow for just a beat. Snake-Eyes uses the moment to catch Storm shadow with his feet, holding him up for a split second as the ENERGY LASERS come back on. One of them burns deeply across Storm Shadow's neck, he SCREAMS and stumbles back and falls OVER THE EDGE and down into the freezing turgid waters. Snake- Eyes steps up and looks down to see if he surfaces... He doesn't. \nSNAKE-EYES Father always feared it would come to this. EXPLOSIONS begin to rock the shaft now. Snake-Eyes stumbles towards the exit, leaving his fallen Sword Brother behind. \nINT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY \nHeavy Duty sees the cannon return to its dormant position. \nHEAVY DUTY Turbo-laser is down! He guns his engines, firing at a MANTIS attack craft. It EXPLODES. Heavy Duty howls with delight. Around him, the Joes begin to turn the tide of the battle. A SERIES OF SHOTS of Mantis vehicles getting nailed by Joe harpoon cannons. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY \nThey feel the EXPLOSIONS in the control room. Screens short out. Water starts to cascade in through BURSTING RIVETS. \n", "test1_input": "Duke and Ripcord run through and URBAN ENVIRONMENT OBSTACLE COURSE, 3D HOLO-PROJECTION TERRORISTS lunging out at them. The guys take them out one by one, never more than a split second after they appear. The HOLO-PROJECTIONS fritz and die. They reach the end of the and a BUZZER SOUNDS. At the back, arms crossed, impassively taking it all in, is Hawk. Scarlett approaches the guys with an ELECTRONIC CLIPBOARD. \nSCARLETT Sixty-three seconds. Not Bad. But not good enough. Gotta get under a minute to qualify. \nDUKE What's the record? \nSCARLETT Forty-five. \nRIPCORD Don't tell me, Snake-Eyes? \nSCARLETT No, me. Ripcord glances at Scarlett's CROSSBOW PISTOL. \nRIPCORD You can do this whole course with that thing in forty-five seconds? \nSCARLETT If you're going to shoot at something, kill it. Otherwise take up knitting. \nRIPCORD When I want something, I don't just shoot at it... (steps close to her) When I get a target in my sights, I take it down. His meaning is clear. She holds his gaze, slaps a magazine into her CROSSBOW PISTOL and hands it to him. \nSCARLETT Here. Go on. Try it. \nRIPCORD I wouldn't want to show you up. \nSCARLETT Oh, that's so thoughtful of you. \nRIPCORD What can I tell you? I guess I'm just a considerate, humble guy. You'll learn that about me. \nSCARLETT I'm the \"target in your sights,\" right? You've got ten rounds to \"take me down\". \nRIPCORD I don't want to hurt you. \nSCARLETT They're training arrows. The most I'll feel is a little jolt. \nScarlett walks back and faces him. He glances aside at Duke who is loving this. Ripcord readies the pistol. Scarlett darts left. He shoots and misses. She darts right. He misses. \nDUKE C'mon, Rip. Ripcord tries harder, genuinely doing his best. But Scarlett us too fast. Ducking and weaving around Ripcord, as nimble as a cat. Five more shots miss her. And now Ripcord's feeling the pressure. He waits for her to move. Fires. She leaps up onto a corner wall and the bolt passes underneath. He fires again as she lands, ducks under it and rolls up to him. He fires his last bolt point blank. She catches it in her left hand by the stem as it leaves the chamber. Slamming her body up against his. Right hand behind his head, left hand holding the bolt. Their faces close. Lips closer. Ripcord's eyes on hers as he whispers: \nSCARLETT Guess you didn't really want me that bad, rip. She holds his eyes a moment longer, then lets him go. As she walks away, Scarlett casually tosses the ARROW, it hits the ground and EXPLODES. Ripcord and Duke jump back. Ripcord glances at the underside of the pistol's magazine. Three words: \"CAUTION: LIVE BOLTS\". Both men watch Scarlett saunter back to the beginning of the course, awestruck. Breaker walks by eating a burrito and watching his bio-rhythm display. \nBREAKER Aw, Ripcord's heart just skipped a beat. Isn't that sweet? \nEXT. THE PIT - DESER - DUSK \nThe sun is sinking, turning the dunes a brilliant orange. \nINT. SECURITY ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT \nSecurity works a console in the Security Room. Their infrared monitors show a HERDSMAN AND HIS CAMELS walking across the desert dunes. A Technician taps some keys and an X-RAY IMAGE shows the skeletal structures of the herdsman and his camels. \nEXT. THE PIT - DESERT - NIGHT \nThe HERDSMAN walks across the desert with his CAMELS under a FULL MOON and a field of glittering stars. All of a sudden, MULTIPLE MOUNDS OF SAND whip past his feet, almost knocking him over. He stares at them as they abruptly disappear deeper under the sand, like diving submarines. \nINT. MOLE POD - UNDERGROUND - NIGHT \nAna drives the lead MOLE POD, an oblong-shaped digging device that is just large enough for her to fit inside. She watches her HUD relay information about her angle of decent and her distance to the target. Thirty yards...twenty yards...ten... \nINT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT \nA light flashes on the console in the security room. \nSECURITY TECHNICIAN #1 Sensors detecting seismic activity to the southwest. Probably just a tremor, but have a team check it. \nINT. TRAINING ROOM - NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "DUKE Again. They go at each other, fast and furious, the electrified pugil sticks crackling and sparking. Duke spins and attempts a stroke similar to Snake-Eyes' earlier move. Snake-Eyes blocks it, drops, and sweeps Duke's feet, taking him down hard before finishing him with another SPARKING HIT. Again, the Joes react. Snake-Eyes turns away. Duke shakes it off and pops to his feet once more. \nDUKE (CONT'D) Again. \nSnake-Eyes nods, a little more respect in his eyes now. This time after the high blows are parried, Snake-Eyes tries the sweep. Duke jumps it, rolls, comes up behind Snake-Eyes and STRIKES. Snake-Eyes barely blocks it. They trade half a dozen blows, the electricity popping and crackling before Snake-Eyes tries a finishing blow. Duke stuffs it with his stick and tackles Snake-Eyes. They fall to the ground, both receiving JOLTS. They go eye-to-eye. It wasn't pretty, but Duke is getting effective. Snake-Eyes pops to his feet. This time he offers a hand to pull Duke up. Across the room, Hawk watches with approval. \nINT. THE PIT'S GENERATOR STATION - NIGHT \nThe huge drill bit of Ana's mole machine bursts out of the reinforced clay wall, it opens and retracts, Ana rolls out and drops to the ground. Another huge drill bursts out, it retracts and opens and Storm Shadow drops to the ground. They look around. They're between the clay wall and the ELECTRIFIED POWER GRID FENCE of the Pit's generator station. \nANA The foundation of this fence is a hundred feet deep. No going under. Ten Neo-Viper mole pods start to burst out the wall. And then there's a crashing sound as one of the wall girders bends, obviously a mole machine in the clay behind it hit it. Ana can hear the engine grind to a halt. \nANA (CONT'D) If we don't get him out he'll suffocate. Storm Shadow gives her a look: Like I care? \nANA (CONT'D) Just thought I'd mention it. \nSTORM SHADOW All that matters is the mission. Ana pulls out a hi-tech SCANNING DEVICE which shoots out six STEEL BLUE BEAMS in a 360 DEGREE ARC, creating a DETAILED SCHEMATIC of the Pit, showing rooms and people moving about them. She points down a tunnel beyond the electrified fence. Storm Shadow gestures to one of the Neo-Vipers. The Man immediately walks over and grabs the fence, electricity JOLTS him violently, but the man ignores it and shakily starts climbing the fence. The skin on his hands and arms starts to burn and bubble. \nSTORM SHADOW (CONT'D) Acceptable collateral damage. \nANA (trying to out-tough him) Is there any other? Near the top the Man finally falls backward and drops down dead. Storm Shadow nods to the next Viper. Without hesitation the Man walks over and grabs the fence. He is immediately JOLTED, but keeps climbing, burning and bubbling. This guy makes it to the top, throws himself over, and crashes to the ground, then crawls over and pulls the OFF SWITCH, cutting the electricity before dropping dead himself. Ana, Storm Shadow and the others quickly scale the fence. \nINT. PIT BARRACKS - NIGHT \nAn area where the Joe team chills. Duke and Ripcord enter, sore and worked over. They move to some couches. Heavy Duty grooves to the blasting Reggaeton classic \"Salio El Sol\". \nHEAVY DUTY You can learn a whole hell of a lot about a girl by the way she dances. Tell me I'm wrong Snake-Eyes. Snake-Eyes, sharpening his sword, barely looks up. \nHEAVY DUTY (CONT'D) See? He agrees. \nSCARLETT No, he doesn't. Do you? This time Snake-eyes looks up, his expression unreadable. \nSCARLETT (CONT'D) See, he knows you have to listen to get to know someone. Right, Rip? Rip is happily stowing his liquid armor gear, glances over. \nRIPCORD What? You say something? Breaker sits at a chessboard. Heavy D sits across from him. \nBREAKER Sorry, Scarlett, gotta go with Heavy D on this one. \n(MORE) \nBREAKER (CONT'D) Like my man says, get a girl on the floor, you don't just see how she moves, you get the smell of her. What biologists tell us is that the decision is made by he nose long before the rest of the body gets involved. It's a question of pheromones. \nSCARLETT You're going to teach me science? I read all about the positron emission tomography studies concerning sex pheromones when I was twelve. I'm just saying, it's not very romantic. Rip whispers to Duke, nodding towards Scarlett. \nRIPCORD Heavy told me she graduated college at twelve. No response from Duke, who is trying to get comfortable. \nRIPCORD (CONT'D) She's like a freaky genius. A deadly, freaky genius. \nDUKE You like her, I get it already. \nBREAKER (making a chess move) You can't learn this stuff in a book, Scarlett. You have to at least kiss a guy, before you're an expert on romance. The guys all laugh. Scarlett blushes, then raises her bow. \nSCARLETT Who am I shooting first? The laughter stops. Rip looks surprised. \nRIPCORD You haven't kissed anyone? Now Scarlett looks really furious. Rip instantly wishes he could take his words back. Duke just shakes his head. \nDUKE Really firing on all cylinders there, Rip. \nHEAVY DUTY All I know is, when the bass get's that booty shaking in the right way, I'm in the skin like a man named Flynn. Heavy Duty does a little freak dance. Scarlett makes a show of disgust. Ripcord watches Scarlett, then makes a decision. \nRIPCORD Hell with it. He strides across the room toward Scarlett. Breaker notices. \nBREAKER (to no one in particular) Into the Valley of Death rode the \n", "test1_id": 126, "test2_input": "Heavy Duty looks at him, confused. Breaker nods to Ripcord, stopping near Scarlett's chair. Ripcord sees Snake-Eyes taking in his every move. Scarlett now has her nose in a book. Ripcord CLEARS HIS THROAT but she doesn't look up. He peers closer and WE SEE THE COVER, on which, though in English, is a damn near INDECIPHERABLE SCIENTIFIC TITLE. \nRIPCORD Beach reading, huh? She groans and lowers the book only slightly. \nRIPCORD (CONT'D) Hi, I guess we kinda got off on the wrong foot... Without changing expression she goes back to her book. \nRIPCORD (CONT'D) Okay look, I'm attracted to you. And you, you're attracted to me. And him-- (nods towards Snake-Eyes) The Zen Master, he creeps me out, but what I'm saying is-- \nSCARLETT \"We're attracted to one another.\" \nRIPCORD Thank you. \nSCARLETT That's what you're saying, not what I'm saying. \nRIPCORD Okay, what are you saying? \nSCARLETT Attraction is an emotion. Emotions are not based in science. And if you can't quantify or prove that something exists, well, in my mind... it doesn't. \nRIPCORD Okay, I'll get back to you on that. And he walks away scratching his head. Hawk steps in. Everyone comes to attention. \nHAWK Duke, You scored in the top half- percent of all people we've ever tested. Rip, well, if we average your scores with Duke's, you pass too. Welcome aboard, provisionally. But we still need to see if you pass muster in the field. Hawk gives them a nod. Duke and rip nod back with pride. \nHEAVY DUTY YO JOE! Welcome aboard, boyz! \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nAna, Storm Shadow and the Neo-Vipers creep down the hallway. Two GI JOE GUARDS come around a corner, before they can even react, Storm Shadow practically cuts them in two with his Katana sword. Ana Directs them down another hallway. \nINT. HAWK'S STATEROOM - NIGHT \nA DOOR reads, \"General Hawk\". Cover Girl walks up and knocks. As she waits, we see a SHADOW moving behind her. Hawk opens the door. She hands him her POWERBOOK and a \nSTYLUS. \nCOVER GIRL Sorry to disturb you, general. \nHAWK That's all right, Cover Girl. What am I signing now? Cover Girl GASPS, a KATANA BLADE piercing out through her chest. She drops lifelessly, revealing Storm Shadow behind her. Hawk grabs a PISTOL, but Storm Shadow flashes his two swords. One slices the barrel of the pistol clean off, the other buries itself in Hawk's gut. Hawk collapses. Ana steps forward and rips the General's SECURITY BADGE off his jacket. Hawk's eyes follow them as they leave. He glances at a RED BUTTON under his desk and struggles to reach it, giving everything he's got, until he finally hits the button. \nINT. BARRACKS - NIGHT \nA KLAXON BLARES. Duke, Ripcord and all the Joes leap up. \nDUKE The warheads. They all rush out of the doors. Breaker stops to change a chess piece on the board before racing out. \nINT. MAIN VAULT - NIGHT \nAna swipes Hawk's SECURITY BADGE across the lock of the VAULT DOOR. It opens. The weapons case sits on a table. She opens the case to check that the four warheads are inside, they shine on her glasses. \nINT. MAIN VAULT - MOMENTS LATER \nDuke and Ripcord reach the main vault, armed only with their pistols. They find the INNER VAULT DOOR ajar. They approach, pushing back the door to discover that the place is empty and the weapons case is gone. \nDUKE They can't be far. \nINT. URBAN AREA - NIGHT \nSome of the Neo-Vipers now reach the MOLE PODS and begin prepping them for escape. BOOM! A GRENADE slams into them, killing them and destroying the pods. It's Heavy Duty with his \"MPL\". Ana enters the room and quick-draws her PULSE PISTOL and blasts away. Heavy Duty dives behind cover, which is blown away, knocking him out cold. Storm Shadow examines the ruined MOLE PODS, glancing around, his eyes falling on a pair of \"ARCLIGHT\" JET PACKS mounted on a wall rack nearby. Storm Shadow strides to the nearest one and puts it on. Ana heads after him, still carrying the case. Suddenly, Duke and Ripcord rush up behind them, guns raised. \nDUKE Put the case down, Ana, Rip trains his gun on Storm Shadow. \nRIPCORD And you get out of that...thing. Stalemate. Storm Shadow doesn't move. Ana turns and looks at Duke. Sets the case down, her voice is gentle. \nANA Fine. Done. Then she takes a step toward Duke. \n", "test2_true": "ANA You can't shoot me, can you? \nDUKE I will if I have to. \nANA Deep down, you're still the same man I fell in love with. \nDUKE Don't force this, Ana. \nANA What could have been, right, Duke? You beside your best man. Me walking down the aisle. \nRIPCORD Don't listen to her, Duke. (a thought) Was I really going to be your best man? \nDUKE (cocking the pistol) Don't make me do this god-damnit! \nANA \"Don't make me do this?\" A recurring theme in your life, right Duke? She takes another step. Duke levels his pistol right at her forehead. Storm Shadow flinches. Duke gives him a glance. \nDUKE Move and I'll blow her away. (to Ripcord) Get the briefcase. Ana takes another step forward, daring Duke to pull the trigger. Ripcord, gun drawn and fixed on Storm Shadow, moves slowly forward to retrieve the briefcase. Ana is now an inch from the extended barrel. Ana and Duke are close enough to feel each other's breath. Their eyes lock. \nANA Do it, Duke. .You already killed me once. And in Duke's eyes we see him falter, just a bit. Ripcord passes Ana, and wit hone lightning quick hand she slaps at Duke's pistol. AN ERRANT SHOT GOES OFF. Storm Shadow lunges at ripcord, SLICING his pistol in half with one sword and about to kill him with the other. When suddenly, Snake-Eyes lunges INTO FRAME. CLANG! Snake- Eyes' KATANA BLADE saves Ripcord's life by a half inch. The rest of the Neo-Vipers arrive and immediately open fire, pinning both Duke and Ripcord down. All hell breaks loose. Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow lunge at one another, swords flashing at impossible speeds, then they lock swords. Face- to-face, staring hard into each other's eyes. \nSnake-Eyes glances at Storm Shadow's right forearm, spotting the same RED MARKINGS of his ninja clan underneath his suit sleeve. This shocks the hell out of Snake-Eyes. Storm Shadow smiles. \nSTORM SHADOW \n(CYNICAL) Hello brother. Snake-Eyes looks shocked. Storm Shadow uses the moment to elbow him in the face, knocking him hard to the ground. Ana grabs the weapons case as Scarlett rushes in, aiming her \nCROSSBOW PISTOL. \nSCARLETT I believe you've got my luggage. Ana stares at Scarlett, then quick-draws a PULSE PISTOL. Her shot tears the CROSSBOW PISTOL out of Scarlett's hands. Ana's got her dead-to-rights until Scarlett triggers her CAMO- SUIT, melting into nothing right in front of Ana. Ana doesn't spot the RIPPLES OF AIR around her until she's stuck hard. The case goes flying. Another SMACK and her pistol is knocked free. Ana grabs a second pistol, but that's just as quickly twisted out of her grasp and dropped. Ana fights the invisible Scarlett as best she can, but Scarlett lands several unseen blows on her. Ripcord and Duke take out a pair of Neo-Vipers. Storm Shadow climbs back into the Arclight. Looking at ana as she falls near a vehicle on the blocks. Ana grabs an OIL PAN and flings the oil, which sprays over everything, including Scarlett, making her visible. Ana leaps on Scarlett, knocks her to the ground and angrily begins to choke the life out of her. Storm Shadow ignites the Arclight which jumps into the air, powered by an arc of blue light shooting out of its engine pack. He quickly swoops towards the two women and grabs ana by her arm, pulling her along. Ana grabs the weapons case and they soar up out of the motor pool and over the landing pad. The battle raging below them. Ripcord and Duke fire after them, but they vanish up into the next level. Heavy Duty, now back in action, takes out the last of the Neo-Vipers. Snake-Eyes checks on Scarlett who's nursing her neck. \nINT. ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nAna climbs to Storm Shadow as the rocket up to the SECURITY ROOM WINDOW and BLAST it out of their way. SHATTER CITY. \nINT. SECURITY ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT \nThey fly into the security room and quickly dispatch the few technicians still alive. Ana his the large switch on the console and the huge door begins to spiral open. She jumps back into Storm Shadow's arms and they blast back out-- \nEXT. ENTRANCE - THE PIT - NIGHT \n--and fly up through the hole where their Typhoon gunship rockets up.

WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAWN \nThe AMERICAN PRESIDENT quickly but quietly closes the door to his bedroom, throwing on a robe, he charges down a corridor, trailed by his STAFF and BODYGUARDS. One of the staffers hands the President a report which he skims through. \nPRESIDENT How many warheads? \nSTAFFER #1 Four, Mr. President. \nPRESIDENT Any threats? Any demands? \nSTAFFER #1 None so far, sir. \nSTAFFER #2 We take this to mean the terrorists are unfocused, no clear goals.

A puzzling beat. And then the Scarab thunders up behind them at full speed. Ripcord dives out of the way just in time. Duke has no such luck. He spins and catches the FRONT GRILL, digging his feet into the road in an attempt to slow the Scarab down. But the Scarab now angles towards a busy intersection, threatening to crush DUKE in the criss-crossing traffic. Duke throws himself onto the hood just as an SUV CRASHES into the front grill and is chucked away like so much garbage. Duke tumbles up onto the roof. A PULSE CANNON pops up. Duke dives off the back as the weapon fires. He tumbles to the pavement as Ripcord speeds up to him, firing his WRIST- MOUNTED ROCKETS at the Scarab. Duke fires with him. \nINT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY \nTheir rockets nail the Scarab and knock out the PULSE CANNON. BOOM! But its armor saves the vehicle. INSIDE: Storm Shadow and Ana are knocked around.

Ana quickly and nervously starts to buckle in. \nANA How thoughtful. \nINT. BRAWLER - DAY \nOn the monitors, Scarlett and Breaker watch the Scarab via Snake-Eyes speeding through the streets. \nSCARLETT Look at the moves they're making, they're heading somewhere. Breaker widens the map, plotting a route. \nBREAKER This's their route from the lab.

Duke and Rip are catching up behind him. \nSCARLETT'S VOICE Guys, you have to stop them. \nDUKE Yeah, we're working on it. \nSCARLETT'S VOICE I mean right now. They're going to detonate one of the warheads on the Eiffel Tower. Ripcord glances up and sees the Eiffel Tower looming up fast. \nRIPCORD Oh, man... Under the Scarab, Snake-Eyes pulls out his GLOCK PISTOL and fires into the unprotected insides of the FRONT TIRES, which promptly rip to shreds. The Neo-Viper loses control of the vehicle, SMASHES through a GUARD ARM onto train tracks. Snake-Eyes sees something, lets go, rolls free and crashes into garbage cans just as a METRO TRAIN barrels into the Scarab, which LAUNCHES into the air, hood-over-tailpipe. Duke and Ripcord are running too fast to stop. Duke manages to leap into the air, his boots barely scraping the top of the train while Ripcord covers his face with his hands and PLUNGES headlong into a window on the side of the train... \nINT.

Storm Shadow is incredibly beat and bloody, but Ana is just fine in her red Accelerator Suit. Storm Shadow grabs the weapons case and he and Ana leap out. Duke and Ripcord pick themselves up while Snake-Eyes crawls out of the TRASH CANS nearby. They see Storm Shadow and Ana emerge from the Scarab and hurry off towards the tower. \nDUKE (CONT'D) C'mon! Snake-Eyes follows Duke and Ripcord, charging after them. \nEXT. EIFFEL TOWER - DAY \nHUNDREDS OF TOURISTS swarm around the south base of the tower to buy their tickets and start their tours. Storm Shadow and Ana burst through them, slamming past SECURITY GUARDS as they bound onto the stairs. People scream at the sight of Ana. Duke and Ripcord arrive seconds later, rushing up in their Accelerator Suits like beings from another world. They spot Ana and Storm Shadow on the stairs and hurry after them. The Security Guards draw their pistols and start SHOOTING at Duke and Ripcord. The BULLETS ping off their suits. \nRIPCORD (to Duke) How do you say \"we're the good guys\" in French? Meanwhile, Snake-Eyes evades all the chaos by leaping up under the south base, scaling the iron lattice like a monkey. \nON THE FIRST FLOOR: Ana and Storm Shadow crest the stairs and rudely push through the crowd to the stairway on the opposite side of the floor. Another SECURITY GUARD draws a gun on them but Storm Shadow snatches the weapon out of the man's hands, swatting him with the butt, all without missing a step. The crowd panics and runs screaming for the stairs-- --where Duke and Ripcord are struggling to catch up. The avalanche of tourists slows their progress. Underneath the stairway, however, Snake-Eyes continues to climb fast without a safety net. He makes it to the first floor and races after Ana and Storm Shadow. ON THE GROUND: The Brawler screeches up. Scarlett's first out with Breaker and Heavy Duty behind her. All of them carrying weapons. The Security Guards instantly go on the defensive as they hurry up to the stairway. Guns go up. Scarlett speaks to them urgently in French. \nSCARLETT (French, subtitled) Don't shoot! We're a special anti- terrorist unit! There's a bomb up there! POLICE CARS are now rushing up behind them. ON THE SECOND FLOOR: Ana and Storm Shadow speed over to the main tower ELEVATOR and barge their way inside. Storm Shadow hurls the ELEVATOR OPERATOR out as Ana opens the weapons case and removes one of the NANOTECH WARHEADS and its KILL SWITCH. Through the stunned crowd, they see Snake-Eyes reach the top of the stairs behind. Ana rolls the warhead towards him while Storm Shadow lines up on him with the Security Guard's pistol as if to shoot him. Snake-Eyes glares defiantly at Storm Shadow who just grins and lowers his gun at the warhead. A SINGLE SHOT AND THE WARHEAD EXPLODES. Snake-Eyes recoils. ON THE GROUND: Everyone hears the warhead detonate. ON THE FIRST FLOOR: Duke and Ripcord freeze. ON THE SECOND FLOOR: A BURST OF NANO-MITES spreads out in all directions. Storm Shadow closes the ELEVATOR DOORS and hits a button for the top. The elevator races upwards as everything else gets eaten by the ravenous NANO-MITES. The floor begins to disappear. Tourists stampede towards the stairs. A LITTLE GIRL is thrown from her MOTHER'S GRIP. The mother screams out for her child as the girl goes over the railing. \nON THE FIRST FLOOR: a hundred feet up, Duke and Rip see her coming. Ripcord swings out and catches the girl just in time. Above them, the tower is dissolving before their eyes. Duke sees Snake-Eyes being pushed down the stairs by the tourists. He leaps up onto the iron lattice. \nRIPCORD Where you going? \nDUKE Each warhead has a kill switch. \nRIPCORD It's too late! We gotta get off this thing! \nDUKE Those nano-mites will level the entire city! Duke climbs up the side of the tower with his Accelerator Suit. Rip things about following, but then looks at the little girl in his arms, who smiles and hugs him. Snake-Eyes grabs him and they join the flow of people down the stairs. The NANO-MITES chasing them close behind. Below them, Scarlett, Breaker, and Heavy Duty are helping the police evacuate the Tower. INSIDE THE ELEVATOR: Ana and Storm Shadow race to the top. \nANA (into mike) Be ready to pick up in thirty seconds. IN THE SKIES: The Typhoon gunship rockets towards the top of the disintegrating Eiffel Tower, its SIDE DOOR opening. ON THE TOWER: Duke scales the tower, the NANO-MITES chasing him up. His eyes on the elevator as it reaches the top deck just above him. The Typhoon fires a blast of its CONCUSSION CANNONS at Duke, knocking him off the tower. He falls, but manages to catch the tower just below, the NANO-MITES almost on top of him now. The climbs even faster. ON THE TOP DECK: The elevator arrives. Ana and Storm Shadow calmly walk out and climb the railing as the Typhoon hovers up beside them. Below them, Duke sees them board. The tower groans and wobbles. It's a long way down. Time has run out. Ana and Storm Shadow jump into the Typhoon. \nWith the NANO-MITES at his heels, Duke clambers up and jumps up off the side of the Tower, sailing up through the air and latching onto the SIDE DOOR of the Typhoon. IN THE TYPHOON: The gunship rocks with his sudden weight. Ana and Storm Shadow almost lose their footing. Duke springs inside. He smacks Storm Shadow down and grabs the KILL SWITCH from Ana, pressing the trigger. Immediately, the NANO-MITES pulse with light and fall to the ground around the Eiffel Tower. The Tower groans, half-eaten, then topples over on its side. Ripcord and Snake-Eyes scurry out of the way as it crashes down onto the Seine, sending up an enormous explosion of water. The shock on the faces of everyone around reverberates through the entire Joe team. Ripcord keeps his eyes on the Typhoon as it pulls away. Breaker suddenly gets an idea. \nBREAKER Come on! He hauls-ass. \nINT. TYPHOON - DAY \nAna looks at Duke, a pursed smile on her lips. \nANA You just saved Paris. Storm Shadow is not happy at all, he TASERS Duke, who drops hard to the floor of the Typhoon. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nA crowd has gathered around the crashed Scarab. Heavy Duty yanks one of the dead Neo-Vipers out. Breaker yanks off the guy's HELMET then removes a needle-like PORT PLUG from his SURVEILLANCE SUIT. Scarlett moves into position to help him. Ripcord kneels down. \nRIPCORD What are you doing? \nBREAKER Plugging into his cerebral cortex. With a SICKENING CRUNCH, Breaker plunges the needle into the top of the Neo-Viper's head. Ripcord winces at the sight. \nSCARLETT The brain survives for a couple of minutes after death. We can read his most recent memories. \nRIPCORD Can you find Duke? \nBREAKER If this guy remembers the way home we can. INSERT: A FLASH OF MEMORIES appearing on Breaker's HUD.

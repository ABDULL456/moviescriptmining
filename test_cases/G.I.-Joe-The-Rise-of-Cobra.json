Pure evil. \nDOCTOR (V.0.) \n(PRELAP) That ought to hold you. \nINT. MEDICAL WING - DAY \nDuke \"comes to\" as the Doctor finishes and walks away. Duke takes a breath, looks to Hawk in his bed, then stands and walks over. He stares down at Hawk, then, a promise-- \nDUKE Graveyard dead. \nINT. MEDICAL EXAMINATION ROOM - THE PIT - DAY \nDuke, Ripcord, Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, and Heavy Duty stare at some next-gen computerized ultra-sound PHOTOSTATS of a dead Neo-Viper. Snake-Eyes points in question to an area. \nSCARLETT Nano-mites. I wrote my thesis on the theory behind them at Oxford. They've been surgically implanted behind the ear, all programmed to accomplish different tasks. \nDUKE Like what? \nSCARLETT Theoretically, the possibilities are endless. Increase their speed, agility, resilience. You program, they perform. That's the genius of nanotechnology, it can do pretty much whatever you want it to. \nDUKE Mind control? \nSCARLETT I don't see why not. \nINT. CORRIDOR - THE PIT - DAY \nDuke and Ripcord move with the others through a corridor. \nDUKE Their weaponry, financing, intel, it has to be McCullen. Doing an inside job on his own warheads. \nSCARLETT You may be right. Maybe he needed NATO to pay for his R D. \nRIPCORD The weapons case! Everyone stops and looks at Ripcord like he's nuts. \nRIPCORD (CONT'D) Remember he had us open the case for him. Remember that? \nSCARLETT What about it? \nRIPCORD I'll bet that code he gave us like re-activated the tracking beacon or something. Looks pass among the group, it starts to make sense. \nDUKE And who says you're not a thinker. All of the sudden, Breaker rushes up to them, out of breath. \nBREAKER I think I found her... \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - DAY \nBreaker leads the group into the control room where a WEDDING PHOTO OF ANA AND DeCobray is up on screen. Duke stares at the photo, gazing at her face. Ripcord sees her and knows, too. \nDUKE Yeah, you found her all right. \nBREAKER Her name is Ana DeCobray now, Baroness if you're feeling formal. \nRIPCORD Wow, she traded up, huh? (off Duke's look) I mean... financially. \nDUKE Who is he? \nBREAKER Baron DeCobray. Big shot French scientist. Runs a lab in Paris. \nSCARLETT Lab? Breaker call up an image of DeCobray standing in front of a huge PARTICLE ACCELERATOR along with some other scientists. \nBREAKER Particle accelerator. \n", "test1_true": "DUKE That's where she's going. \nHEAVY DUTY Who likes croissants? \nEXT.

Scarlett shares a smile with Ripcord, next to her, Across from them Duke watches, almost smiles, then lays back his head and closes his eyes. AND WE \nFLASHBACK TO: \nEXT. JUNGLE VILLAGE - DAY \nCAMERA PANS AROUND a village choked by thick jungle as EXPLOSIONS erupt in SLO-MO and a BLACKHAWK circles, ROTORS beating hypnotically, giving the images a dreamlike quality. \nINT. BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER, DAWN - FLASHBACK \nDuke, Ripcord, Rex, and the rest of an insertion team, sit with their backs against the chopper walls. \nDUKE Per the briefing, we fast rope in, form up and assault the main lab... (a glance at Rex) Rex--uh, .the science officer, stays back with Fireteam Alpha until Bravo enters and secures the building. Alpha holds the perimeter while science officer secures the WMDs. Five minutes before extraction and the airstrike. The squad nods. Duke looks to Rex again. Rex is sweating, trying not to show it. Duke hands him a piece of gum. \nDUKE (CONT'D) Double Bubble? Rex takes it. Duke blows a bubble, smiles at Rex. \nDUKE (CONT'D) Always helps me. You good? \nREX (weak smile back) Yeah... They chew their gum. \nEXT. JUNGLE VILLAGE - FLASHBACK - DAY \nDOWN IN THE VILLAGE: Duke leads a frontal assault of the main building. They take fire from some GUARDS, but put them down. Other GUARDS flee. The way to the door is cleared. Duke gives hand signals along with his commands. \nDUKE Go, Bravo. Bravo, a TWO-MAN fire team hit the door of the building. They disappear inside. Rex, a kit bag over his shoulder and a .45 Colt ACP on his hip, waits in a crouch, Duke next to him puts a hand on his shoulder. Duke scans the treeline for any treats. One of Bravo Team appears in the doorway and signals \"ALL CLEAR.\" Duke double taps Rex on the shoulder. \nDUKE (CONT'D) You're good to go, Rex. You don't find it in four minutes, get out of there, because that house won't be standing in five. I already called for the air strike. Rex nods. Duke gives him a smile. Rex takes off and runs low to the door, entering the house. Duke watches him go, then looks back to the jungle and hears the WHUMP of mortars. Duke takes one more look, Rex disappears safely inside, then the mortar rounds start to hit. The ground is torn apart, dirt flying in the air, as Duke, Rip and the rest of the squad takes cover. We catch glimpses of the enemy, lots of them, in the jungle, firing. Duke and Ripcord pop up and return fire. \nRIPCORD I've gotta level with ya! \nDUKE I hate it when you level with me. \nRIPCORD Gonna be a long five minutes. Duke just grits his teeth and keeps firing. Then, in the distance, RUMBLING coming from the sonic roar of JETS. \nRIPCORD (CONT'D) I love that sound... But then he looks to Duke, confusion on his face. \nDUKE No, no, no... It's too soon. ANGLE ON: The F-16s in formation streaking toward them across the sky. Duke looks back at the main building. \nDUKE (CONT'D) Rex. Duke runs for the building. Tracer fire and mortar explosions all around him. Then the whistle of a bunker buster. Duke dives and BOOM! The building is flattened by the bomb. Duke is tossed through the air like a rag doll. Lands hard, barely registers the pain, staggers up, bloody and ripped, stumbles toward the smoking. Flaming rubble that was the building. The Blackhawk comes sweeping low, ready for extraction, the tracer fire and explosions intensify. Black smoke washes over Duke. Ripcord finds him in the debris. \nRIPCORD Blackhawk's waiting. Come on, we've got wounded! And incoming enemy! Lots of 'em! \nDUKE I can't. \nRIPCORD Nothing you can do. Come on...! Gunfire bursts around them as Ripcord pulls Duke away from the ruins of the house. \nINT. BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER - FLASHBACK \nTIGHT ON Duke's haunted, soot-streaked face as his eyes take on a thousand-yard stare. AND WE CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT: \nINT.

ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY \nDuke and Ripcord see the building in front of them. \nRIPCORD There's no door! \nBREAKER'S VOICE Make one! Duke charges directly at the building. Ripcord reluctantly following as Duke smashes through the wall into... \nINT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - PARIS - DAY \nA crowded bar. Neither of them slow for a second. Duke bolts through. Rip grabs a MARTINI, opens his visor, downs the drink, then places the empty glass on the tray of a stunned waitress. Behind her a sign reads: \"DRINK RESPONSIBLY\". Duke and Ripcord SMASH through the opposite wall... \nEXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY \n.back out onto the city streets where they turn and level their WRIST-MOUNTED ROCKETS at...nothing. A puzzling beat. And then the Scarab thunders up behind them at full speed. Ripcord dives out of the way just in time. Duke has no such luck. He spins and catches the FRONT GRILL, digging his feet into the road in an attempt to slow the Scarab down. But the Scarab now angles towards a busy intersection, threatening to crush DUKE in the criss-crossing traffic. Duke throws himself onto the hood just as an SUV CRASHES into the front grill and is chucked away like so much garbage. Duke tumbles up onto the roof. A PULSE CANNON pops up. Duke dives off the back as the weapon fires. He tumbles to the pavement as Ripcord speeds up to him, firing his WRIST- MOUNTED ROCKETS at the Scarab. Duke fires with him. \nINT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY \nTheir rockets nail the Scarab and knock out the PULSE CANNON. BOOM! But its armor saves the vehicle. INSIDE: Storm Shadow and Ana are knocked around. Storm Shadow pops a hatch and grabs one of their own ACCELERATOR SUITS. Hands it to Ana. \nSTORM SHADOW Mr. McCullen would be quite unhappy if I let you die. Ana quickly and nervously starts to buckle in. \nANA How thoughtful. \nINT. BRAWLER - DAY \nOn the monitors, Scarlett and Breaker watch the Scarab via Snake-Eyes speeding through the streets. \nSCARLETT Look at the moves they're making, they're heading somewhere. Breaker widens the map, plotting a route. \nBREAKER This's their route from the lab. On the screen, they see the lab, the current position of the Scarab, and what lies just ahead. . .the Eiffel Tower. \nSCARLETT \n(REALIZING) Metal... Oh God... \nEXT. SCARAB/STREETS - DAY \nSnake-Eyes is now desperately clinging to the undercarriage. Duke and Rip are catching up behind him. \nSCARLETT'S VOICE Guys, you have to stop them. \nDUKE Yeah, we're working on it. \nSCARLETT'S VOICE I mean right now. They're going to detonate one of the warheads on the Eiffel Tower. Ripcord glances up and sees the Eiffel Tower looming up fast. \nRIPCORD Oh, man... Under the Scarab, Snake-Eyes pulls out his GLOCK PISTOL and fires into the unprotected insides of the FRONT TIRES, which promptly rip to shreds. The Neo-Viper loses control of the vehicle, SMASHES through a GUARD ARM onto train tracks. Snake-Eyes sees something, lets go, rolls free and crashes into garbage cans just as a METRO TRAIN barrels into the Scarab, which LAUNCHES into the air, hood-over-tailpipe. Duke and Ripcord are running too fast to stop. Duke manages to leap into the air, his boots barely scraping the top of the train while Ripcord covers his face with his hands and PLUNGES headlong into a window on the side of the train... \nINT. METRO-RAIL TRAIN - DAY \n.flying across the aisle, whipping past a group of stunned morning COMMUTERS, and smashing out through the far window... \nEXT. CITY STREETS - DAY \nThe Scarab, Duke and Rip all CRASH HARD to the pavement and tumble. Sparks and flame and flying metal everywhere. Duke and Rip finally stop tumbling, a hundred yards away from the wreck of the Scarab. \nINT./EXT. BRAWLER - CITY STREETS - DAY \nScarlett, Heavy Duty and Breaker see this on their monitors. \nHEAVY DUTY/BREAKER Holy shit... \nSCARLETT \n", "test2_true": "EXT. RAILWAY CROSSING - CITY STREETS - DAY \nDuke and Ripcord's visors lift, both looking a bit wigged. \nDUKE What happened to you? \nRIPCORD I went through the train. What happened to you? \nDUKE I jumped over it. \nRIPCORD You can do that? \nDUKE Yeah, you didn't know? INSIDE THE SCARAB: We see the Neo-Vipers are dead. Storm Shadow is incredibly beat and bloody, but Ana is just fine in her red Accelerator Suit. Storm Shadow grabs the weapons case and he and Ana leap out. Duke and Ripcord pick themselves up while Snake-Eyes crawls out of the TRASH CANS nearby. They see Storm Shadow and Ana emerge from the Scarab and hurry off towards the tower. \nDUKE (CONT'D) C'mon! Snake-Eyes follows Duke and Ripcord, charging after them. \nEXT. EIFFEL TOWER - DAY \nHUNDREDS OF TOURISTS swarm around the south base of the tower to buy their tickets and start their tours. Storm Shadow and Ana burst through them, slamming past SECURITY GUARDS as they bound onto the stairs. People scream at the sight of Ana. Duke and Ripcord arrive seconds later, rushing up in their Accelerator Suits like beings from another world. They spot Ana and Storm Shadow on the stairs and hurry after them. The Security Guards draw their pistols and start SHOOTING at Duke and Ripcord. The BULLETS ping off their suits. \nRIPCORD (to Duke) How do you say \"we're the good guys\" in French? Meanwhile, Snake-Eyes evades all the chaos by leaping up under the south base, scaling the iron lattice like a monkey. \nON THE FIRST FLOOR: Ana and Storm Shadow crest the stairs and rudely push through the crowd to the stairway on the opposite side of the floor. Another SECURITY GUARD draws a gun on them but Storm Shadow snatches the weapon out of the man's hands, swatting him with the butt, all without missing a step. The crowd panics and runs screaming for the stairs-- --where Duke and Ripcord are struggling to catch up. The avalanche of tourists slows their progress. Underneath the stairway, however, Snake-Eyes continues to climb fast without a safety net. He makes it to the first floor and races after Ana and Storm Shadow. ON THE GROUND: The Brawler screeches up. Scarlett's first out with Breaker and Heavy Duty behind her. All of them carrying weapons. The Security Guards instantly go on the defensive as they hurry up to the stairway. Guns go up. Scarlett speaks to them urgently in French. \nSCARLETT (French, subtitled) Don't shoot! We're a special anti- terrorist unit! There's a bomb up there! POLICE CARS are now rushing up behind them. ON THE SECOND FLOOR: Ana and Storm Shadow speed over to the main tower ELEVATOR and barge their way inside. Storm Shadow hurls the ELEVATOR OPERATOR out as Ana opens the weapons case and removes one of the NANOTECH WARHEADS and its KILL SWITCH. Through the stunned crowd, they see Snake-Eyes reach the top of the stairs behind. Ana rolls the warhead towards him while Storm Shadow lines up on him with the Security Guard's pistol as if to shoot him. Snake-Eyes glares defiantly at Storm Shadow who just grins and lowers his gun at the warhead. A SINGLE SHOT AND THE WARHEAD EXPLODES. Snake-Eyes recoils. ON THE GROUND: Everyone hears the warhead detonate. ON THE FIRST FLOOR: Duke and Ripcord freeze. ON THE SECOND FLOOR: A BURST OF NANO-MITES spreads out in all directions. Storm Shadow closes the ELEVATOR DOORS and hits a button for the top. The elevator races upwards as everything else gets eaten by the ravenous NANO-MITES. The floor begins to disappear. Tourists stampede towards the stairs. A LITTLE GIRL is thrown from her MOTHER'S GRIP. The mother screams out for her child as the girl goes over the railing. \nON THE FIRST FLOOR: a hundred feet up, Duke and Rip see her coming. Ripcord swings out and catches the girl just in time. Above them, the tower is dissolving before their eyes. Duke sees Snake-Eyes being pushed down the stairs by the tourists. He leaps up onto the iron lattice. \nRIPCORD Where you going? \nDUKE Each warhead has a kill switch. \nRIPCORD It's too late! We gotta get off this thing! \nDUKE Those nano-mites will level the entire city! Duke climbs up the side of the tower with his Accelerator Suit. Rip things about following, but then looks at the little girl in his arms, who smiles and hugs him. Snake-Eyes grabs him and they join the flow of people down the stairs. The NANO-MITES chasing them close behind. Below them, Scarlett, Breaker, and Heavy Duty are helping the police evacuate the Tower. INSIDE THE ELEVATOR: Ana and Storm Shadow race to the top. \nANA (into mike) Be ready to pick up in thirty seconds. IN THE SKIES: The Typhoon gunship rockets towards the top of the disintegrating Eiffel Tower, its SIDE DOOR opening. ON THE TOWER: Duke scales the tower, the NANO-MITES chasing him up. His eyes on the elevator as it reaches the top deck just above him. The Typhoon fires a blast of its CONCUSSION CANNONS at Duke, knocking him off the tower. He falls, but manages to catch the tower just below, the NANO-MITES almost on top of him now. The climbs even faster. ON THE TOP DECK: The elevator arrives. Ana and Storm Shadow calmly walk out and climb the railing as the Typhoon hovers up beside them. Below them, Duke sees them board. The tower groans and wobbles. It's a long way down. Time has run out. Ana and Storm Shadow jump into the Typhoon. \nWith the NANO-MITES at his heels, Duke clambers up and jumps up off the side of the Tower, sailing up through the air and latching onto the SIDE DOOR of the Typhoon. IN THE TYPHOON: The gunship rocks with his sudden weight. Ana and Storm Shadow almost lose their footing. Duke springs inside. He smacks Storm Shadow down and grabs the KILL SWITCH from Ana, pressing the trigger. Immediately, the NANO-MITES pulse with light and fall to the ground around the Eiffel Tower. The Tower groans, half-eaten, then topples over on its side. Ripcord and Snake-Eyes scurry out of the way as it crashes down onto the Seine, sending up an enormous explosion of water. The shock on the faces of everyone around reverberates through the entire Joe team. Ripcord keeps his eyes on the Typhoon as it pulls away. Breaker suddenly gets an idea. \nBREAKER Come on! He hauls-ass. \nINT. TYPHOON - DAY \nAna looks at Duke, a pursed smile on her lips. \nANA You just saved Paris. Storm Shadow is not happy at all, he TASERS Duke, who drops hard to the floor of the Typhoon. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nA crowd has gathered around the crashed Scarab. Heavy Duty yanks one of the dead Neo-Vipers out. Breaker yanks off the guy's HELMET then removes a needle-like PORT PLUG from his SURVEILLANCE SUIT. Scarlett moves into position to help him. Ripcord kneels down. \nRIPCORD What are you doing? \nBREAKER Plugging into his cerebral cortex. With a SICKENING CRUNCH, Breaker plunges the needle into the top of the Neo-Viper's head. Ripcord winces at the sight. \nSCARLETT The brain survives for a couple of minutes after death. We can read his most recent memories. \nRIPCORD Can you find Duke? \nBREAKER If this guy remembers the way home we can. INSERT: A FLASH OF MEMORIES appearing on Breaker's HUD. Duke shooting him in the face, racing along the highway, driving the ARMORED CAR. As the images continue, we PUSH IN on the Neo-Viper's open eyes and CUT TO: \nINT.

The Doctor's nano-mites can control all manner of brain functions. When you wake up, you'll be working for me, and your past will be a distant shimmer that floats in and out of your mind like a leaf on a breeze. \nTHE DOCTOR I'll prepare him for the surgery. The Doctor beckons the Neo-Vipers who shove Duke after him towards another door. Duke and Ana exchange one last look. McCullen keeps his eyes on her as she watches him go. \nEXT. DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - UNDERWATER - DAY \nA school of fish swims past the facility, one fish breaks away from the school. CAMERA ZOOMS IN TIGHT ON IT: it's not a fish at all, but a mini robotic underwater spy system. \nEXT. SUBMARINE - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nA sleek submarine drifts silently through the arctic waters. \nBREAKER (V.0.) Picture's coming on line now. \nINT. CONN TOWER - SUBMARINE - DAY \nIn the Conn Tower of the sub, our team gathers around Breaker who sits at a monitor watching what the \"fish\" is watching. \nSCARLETT It's an underwater facility... \nHEAVY DUTY McCullen's home away from home. \nRIPCORD Dukes' gotta be in there somewhere. \nSCARLETT Wait, what's that? Breaker ZOOMS IN on a massive TURBO-LASER CANNON. \nBREAKER Oh, Jesus...That's an automated, phased array turbo-pulse battery. (off their looks) A really big gun. \nSCARLETT Could it take out our sub? \nBREAKER That thing could take out a dozen subs simultaneously. \nSCARLETT Then that's our first objective. \nRIPCORD No, no. Duke's our first objective. \nSCARLETT The main force can't attack as long as that cannon's online. \nHEAVY DUTY How you figure getting it offline? Snake-Eyes points to the DIVING BELL CABLES n the monitor. \nSCARLETT Elevator cables. They've got a surface entrance. Shipwreck? She turns to the submarine commander, HECTOR \"SHIPWRECK\" DELGADO, a fiery Spanish naval combat veteran. \nSHIPWRECK Going up, senorita? Scarlett nods and leads the others down a corridor. \nSCARLETT Snake-Eyes, Breaker, Ripcord, and I will infiltrate the factory from above and destroy the cannon. Heavy D, as soon as we give the word, you lead the assault from outside. \nHEAVY DUTY (nods grimly) Go, Joes... \nEXT. ICE FIELD - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY \nA quiet wind blows across a remote stretch of arctic ice. All of a sudden the ice pack begins to tremble like the mother of all earthquakes. It cracks and ruptures and then erupts as the CONN TOWER of the submarine crashes through, then grinds to a halt. A FORWARD HATCH OPENS and two ROCK SLIDES launch out, landing hard on the ice and speeding away. Ripcord and Breaker on one. Scarlett and Snake-Eyes on the other. \nINT. LAUNCH BAY- DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nMcCullen, Ana, and Storm Shadow watch monitors showing TECHNICIANS securing the warheads onto three rocket propelled SMART-DRONES. As the last one is secured a Technician says: \nTECHNICIAN All drones prepared and ready, Sir. \nMCCULLEN Good, commence the launch sequence immediately. is that a ripple of concern flickering across Ana's face? \nINT./EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY \n", "test3_true": "RIPCORD That McCullen's got some gadgets. Breaker gestures to the ice wall. Snake-Eyes uses his Katana sword to slice a circle in the wall and yank it out, revealing the DIVING BELL CABLES, but no diving bell. \nBREAKER Maybe we could slide down. Snake-Eyes shakes his head, doubtful \nSCARLETT The arctic water would kill us. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nMcCullen, Ana, and Storm Shadow watch the drones sitting in the launch bays on the screens. Technicians are working hard. \nTECHNICIAN Three... two... one... ignite primary engines. The entire control room begins to shake. The screens fill with fire. \nINT./EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY \nThe Joes run outside, wondering what the hell is causing the earthquake. A large circle of ice near them MELTS. And then the first drone EXPLODES UP before them and LAUNCHES into the morning sky, peeling away to the east. Before they can react, the second drone EXPLODES UP a hundred yards away, peeling off to the west. They hear the third one about to rocket up-- \nSnake-Eyes thinks fast, sprints into the cave, jumps on a Rock Slide, hauls-ass outside, hits a WEAPONS SWITCH on his Rock Slide, prepping two HEAT-SEEKING ROCKETS on either side of the vehicle. The third drone LAUNCHES UP from two hundred yards away. Snake-Eyes locks onto its exhaust and FIRES. The missiles race up after the drone and knock it out of the sky. It EXPLODES. Metal FLIES. Snow BURNS. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nThe technicians see this on their monitors. \nTECHNICIAN We lost one. \nMCCULLEN Lost one? What do you mean? \nTECHNICIAN Bird Three is down, Sir. McCullen looks at the monitors, enraged. Storm Shadow smiles. \nSTORM SHADOW We're under attack. \nMCCULLEN Alert all defences. Charge up the pulse cannon. He turns to say something to Ana, but she has left the room. \nEXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY \nTopside, the team watches the two remaining drones race away. \nBREAKER What about the other two? \nRIPCORD We find the kill switches and short out the nano-mites. \nBREAKER (shakes his head) They're already way out of range. \nSCARLETT Then somebody has to go up there and shoot those things down. \nRIPCORD \n(PAUSE) That's me. \nINT. NIGHT RAVEN - ICE CAVE - MOMENTS LATER \nRipcord climbs into the Night Raven's cockpit. Scarlett steps up to watch. He's already flipping switches and putting on a \nFLIGHT HELMET. \nSCARLETT Can you even fly this thing? \nRIPCORD I can fly anything. You just track those warheads and guide me in. We don't have long until they hit. \nSCARLETT Ripcord? He glances at her, a moment between them. Then she presses forward and kisses him on the mouth. He stares back at her. \nSCARLETT (CONT'D) Good luck. \nRIPCORD Do me a favor? Save Duke. She gives him a nod, then leaves. Ripcord grins to himself. \n", "test3_id": 128}

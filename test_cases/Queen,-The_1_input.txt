TONY comes back to take the dirty plates.. 
TONY But spare me the whole.."off with their heads" thing. 
CHERIE Why? 
TONY Because it insults your intelligence. 
CHERIE "The case for reform is simple and obvious. It is in principle wrong and absurd that people should wield power on the basis of birth, not merit or election." (a beat) YOUR words, not mine. 
TONY is momentarily thrown.. 
TONY Well, maybe now I've grown up. a beat) It's unimaginable this country being a republic. Certainly in her lifetime. 
CHERIE Why? 
TONY Because...no would would wear it. (can't help laughing at the idea) No one WANTS it. (gestures) It's just...daft. 
TONY heads for the door.. 
HERIE It's not a mother thing, is it? 
TONY turns.. 
CHERIE Think about it. If she were still alive, wouldn't Hazel be exactly the same age? Whenever you talk about your mother, you mention her stoicism. Her frugality. Her sense of duty. The fact she was brought up in the way. Well c'mon..? (a beat) Who does THAT sound like? 
TONY smiles. 
TONY I'm going to do the washing-up.          F ADE TO BLACK 
INT. DOWNING STREET - CORRIDOR - DAY 
ALASTAIR and TONY walk through the labyrinthine corridors and busy offices.. 
ALASTAIR All right, the good news is that the Palace has agreed to video screens in the Royal Parks. 
TONY And the bad news? 
ALASTAIR Crash barriers. 
TONY What about them? 
ALASTAIR hey're now predicting more than two million people will descend on London, and there aren't enough barriers to line the route. So we've gone cap in hand to the French for theirs. And there's something else I think you should see. 
ALASTAIR leads TONY into.. 
INT. DOWNING STREET - MONITORING ROOM - DAY T TONY follows ALASTAIR into an office where a television plays in the corner. Several young AIDES and INTERNS are watching, recording, making notes. Shirtsleeves, feet on desks. Informal. 
ALASTAIR Can we run that piece again? You're going to love this. 
An INTERN puts in a video, hits the `play' button. ON SCREEN: several members of the public complain about the royals. TONY watches for a moment, then.. 
TONY Look, I know all this.. 
ALASTAIR There! 
ne member of the public complains about the flag.. 
TONY Don't tell me. There isn't a flag flying at half mast above Buckingham Palace. 
TONY rolls his eyes to himself. 
TONY God. Will someone save these people from themselves.. (irritated) F ine. I'll call Balmoral... 
TONY turns away, walks towards the door. 
ALASTAIR `Planet Zog'? 
TONY Because as Prime Minister of this country, I've really got nothing better to do.. 
TONY walks out..

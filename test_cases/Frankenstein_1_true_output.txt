A BABY CARRIAGE stands amidst leaning gravestones, gothic and ornate, a chill breeze billowing the lace. 
A PRIEST recites a Latin burial mass. DOZENS OF MOURNERS are gathered before the Frankenstein family mausoleum... an imposing edifice of stone and spidery wrought-iron, its steepled roof crowned by a massive granite crucifix. 
A sleek black casket lies atop the bier, ringed with flowers and sorrow. The trees are windswept and bare, branches stark against a steely gray sky. Victor and Elizabeth stand apart from the others, staring at the casket. Softly: 
VICTOR How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her? 
ELIZABETH It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will. 
Victor raises a grim look at the huge crucifix atop the mausoleum. Christ returns his gaze with blank stone eyes 
VICTOR What kind of God is He to will this? 
ELIZABETH She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him. (beat) I cannot do that alone. 
VICTOR God took her from us. 
ELIZABETH He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother 
Victor glances at the baby carriage. He seeks her hand. Their fingers clasp. Comfort and strength. 
VICTOR Our brother. 
The baby starts CRYING as the casket is lowered, its thin voice carried on the wind... 
EXT - MEADOW - DAY 
A gorgeous, sun-dappled day. Tall grass waving on the breeze. Butterflies skittering. WILLIAM, 11 months-old, toddles into view. He doesn't get far. PLOP! Down he goes, right on his ass. His face scrunches up in surprise and he bursts into tears. 
Elizabeth hurries over and scoops him up, cradling and comforting him. Victor rises from a picnic blanket to join them. Nanny Justine looks up from her task of laying out the silverware and food. 
JUSTINE Poor William! What indignant tears! 
ELIZABETH There, there... shhh... 
Victor takes the baby and swoops him high in the air. The child shrieks and wails, held aloft. 
ELIZABETH Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy! 
VICTOR The world is a dizzying place. 
She tries to reclaim the baby. Victor feints, keeping Willie out of reach. Elizabeth grows crosser: 
ELIZABETH Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held! 
VICTOR He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so? 
Elizabeth is exasperated to realize that the baby has begun to laugh. She glares at both of them. Men. 
ELIZABETH That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise. 
JUSTINE Quite right! 
Victor cradles Willie as if to shield his delicate ears. He peers at Elizabeth with mock-grave suspicion and speaks to the baby sotto-voce, in deepest confidence, man-to-man: 
VICTOR Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz! 
ELIZABETH (laughing) Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel! 
Victor waltzes the baby in circles. Elizabeth stalks them. 
VICTOR Devil take walking, ladies! My brother shall learn to waltz! 
He grabs her by the waist, pulls her into it. There's no use resisting. She succumbs and they dance with the baby between them. Justine is gasping with laughter. 
JUSTINE Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad! 
ELIZABETH Scandalous! What would your dear mother say? 
JUSTINE (thinks a beat) One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three... 
Laughing, Victor and Elizabeth waltz little William around in a sweeping arc. They pass within inches of the CAMERA, bodies wiping frame... 
INT - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT (6 YEARS LATER) 
To reveal the grand ballroom ablaze with candlelight and spectacle as a HUNDRED DANCERS swirl about the floor in a breathtaking waltz to the music of a full string ensemble (NOTE: The music here should be our movie's distinctive WALTZ/LOVE THEME, which will reoccur later.) 
Victor and Elizabeth dance magnificently, room spinning about them in a blur. Now 24, he's in the prime of manhood. 
Elizabeth, 23, is a drop-dead beauty radiating poise and intelligence. They're so right for each other, so beautiful together, your heart could break just looking at them. 
Justine, now 21, has blossomed into a beauty herself. She's at the sidelines, wearing a lovely gown, wishing someone would ask her to dance. William, now 7, scampers to her side. She stoops to straighten his collar and smooth back his hair. Waltzing couples swirl past them. 
WILLIE Auntie Justine, Papa said I could have a sweet. 
JUSTINE You can. But not before dinner.

Cornelius waits until everyone has left, gets down on all fours and crawls through the trapdoor reserved for the pigs. 
122	INT.  FIRST  CLASS  LOUNGE 
Leeloo stands at the buffet in the first class lounge eating everything in sight. 
123	INT.  HALL 
Korben is led down the hall by a STEWARDESS. 
STEWARDESS You are so lucky... Loc Rhod is the coolest DJ in the universe. 
KORBEN Listen... I don't want to be interviewed. I'd prefer to remain anonymous. 
The stewardess stops in the corridor. 
STEWARDESS Forget anonymous.  You'll be doing Loc Rhod's live show every day from 5 to 7! 
KORBEN (expression changes) You gotta be kidding! 
The stewardess smiles and shakes her head.  The door next to him suddenly swings open and smashes him in the face. 
In walks LOC RHOD amidst a tornado of music and security guards.  He is young, good-looking, eccentric, charming as an elf or sly as a fox.  A bundle of energy.  He is the 24th century's most popular DJ. 
LOC RHOD (speedy, in rhythm) Korben Dallas! Here he is The most hated man in the universe. The one and only winner of the Gemini Croquette contest! Ladies, start melting 'cause the boy's hot! Hot! Hot! The boy is perfect.. (he feels his muscles) ...The right size, right build, right hair.  Right on! Say something-to those 50 billion pair of ears out there D-man! 
An ASSISTANT hands a totally lost Korben a mike. 
KORBEN (hesitant) ...Hi. 
LOC RHOD Does it get any better or what! 
Loc Rhod grabs Korben's arm and leads him down the hallway, as fast as the music. 
LOC RHOD ...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service? 
KORBEN Uh... not really. 
Loc Rhod lets go of Korben's arm and grabs the Stewardess. 
LOC RHOD Freeze those knees, my chickadees, 'cause Korben is on the case with a major face... 
Loc Rhod rubs up against the stewardess. 
LOC RHOD ...Start drooling, ladies! My man here is a sharp-tongued Sire who's gonna stroke your every desire. 
They come to an intersection.  The airline company has prepared drinks for them.  Loc Rhod pushes on, grabs a glass of champagne, scribbles his autograph. 
LOC RHOD Yesterday's unknown will be tomorrow's Prince of Fhloston Paradise, the hotel of a thousand and one follies, home of luxury and beauty.  A magic fountain flowing with non-stop wine, women and Bootchie Koochie Koo... 
He tosses away his champagne glass. 
LOC RHOD Beware out there puppy dogs my man is on the prowl. Owwww! 
Howling, Loc Rhod grabs another stewardess by the arm. 
LOC RHOD ...And start licking your stamps little girls, this guy's gonna have you writing home to Momma! Tomorrow from 5 to 7, I'll be your voice, your tongue and I'll be hot on the tail of the sexiest man of the year... D-man... Your man... My man. 
The stewardess shivers.  A BEEP is heard. 
VOCODER (O.S.) End of transmission. 
The MUSIC suddenly stops.  Several assistants come and compliment Loc Rhod who sighs, lights up a cigarette, and drops his pretense. 
LOC RHOD Korben sweetheart do me a favor I know this is probably the biggest thing that ever happened to you in your inconsequential life. But I've got a show to do here and it's got to pop. So tomorrow, when we're on air, give me a hand... Try to make believe you have more than a one word vocabulary. OK pal? 
That does it.  Korben grabs him by the collar and drags him into a corner. Loc Rhod's feet don't touch the ground. 
KORBEN (pissed) I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal? 
LOC RHOD (petrified) Crystal. 
124	INT.  AIRPORT 
The Check-in attendant has two more tickets in her hand. 
CHECK-IN ATTENDANT (alter a moment, reading) ...Mr. Dallas... Korben Dallas? 
Zorg's Right Arm gives her a big smile. 
RIGHT ARM That's right. 
The attendant scans the ID with a yellow beam, it checks out, and the blue light reveals no other face but his. 
CHECK-IN ATTENDANT The problem is I only have one Korben Dallas on my list... and he's already checked in. 
Right Arm's smile shatters. 
RIGHT ARM That's impossible!  He's in j... I mean, there must be some mistake. I have my ticket! I'm the real Korben Dallas! 
A shrill BELL rings out. 
CHECK-IN ATTENDANT (smiling) I'm sorry, sir, boarding is finished. 
The attendant hits a button.  A thick window slowly slides up between them. Right Arm totally loses it. 
RIGHT ARM I want to see your boss!  Get rid of this fucking window! Somebody's made a mistake, goddamnit!

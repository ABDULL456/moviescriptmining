EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 
JENNIFER HILLS races down from a stoop, a suitcase rolling along behind her. Even dressed down, this city girl can't hide her natural beauty and panache. She makes her way across the street and to an SUV. she opens the trunk and tosses in the suitcase among several other bags. 
She closes it, and walks to the driver's side. We see that the entire cargo bay of the SUV is filled with boxes and personal affects.

Jennifer gets in and slams the door shut. she takes a moment to think, to breathe. Something is weighing heavily on her mind. 
After a beat, she glances up to the rearview mirror and looks at herself. She take a long, deep, cleansing breath, and then she turns the key in the ignition and starts the car. B1 EXT. SUV, CITY STREET - DAY Bl The SUV drives off down the city street.

The SUV carves its way through traffic as the city looms in the background, growing more distant by the second.

The midday sun bakes the landscape as Jennifer drives through a country road. A stark contrast from the city, and absolutely breathtaking.

Finally, Jennifer pulls into the driveway of a small house. She picks up a piece of paper from the passenger seat, checks the address on the house, and gets out of the car.

Jennifer walks up the crumbling steps of the house. On the screen door, a wire holds a wooden sign that reads; OPEN. The screen door SQUEAKS loudly as Jennifer pulls it open. 
JENNIFER Hello? 
Jennifer cautiously steps inside. 
4 INT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 4 
The sunlight shines through the dirty curtains. Dust clouds hang motionless in the air, as if suspended in a solution. Scattered across the floor are a variety of electronics in various stages of disrepair. A handful of old, picture tube TVs with their plastic casings cracked. 
JENNIFER Hello? 
Jennifer walks in further, trying to not step on anything. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Hello? 
EARL (O.S.) I'm a coming, I'm a coming.

The police don't have an easy answer to that. 
ANGLE ON DREW 
Who is surprised that the d.s. is sticking up for him. 
D.S. 
You are wise. You know what is right and what is not right. This disciple does not even know right from wrong. Who will teach him if we do not? 
This sinks in, and the police have nothing to say. The Headmistress will not keep quiet, however. 
HEADMISTRESS 
He does not belong here! 
DREW 
(whisper) Chill out, honey! Drew catches a hard look from the D.S. 
D.S. Would you be so hard hearted as to turn him away from that which he so desperately needs? She is about to speak, but thinks better of it. San De stands up, signalling that the meeting is over. SAN DE Thank you all for coming. I am pleased that you brought this problem to our attention. May you sleep well tonight 
knowing that the situation has been swiftly resolved. POLICE CAPTAIN I do not wish to visit you again with this kind of news. SAN DE You will not have to. The Headmistress starts to say something, but San De holds up his hand, stopping her. He leads them out, then closes the door and comes back to face Drew. DREW Master, I can't tell you how sorry I am. I appreciate you both going to bat like that for me. I won't let it happen again. 
SAN DE 
Neither will we. You must leave the temple in the morning. 
DREW 
But I thought... the police... 
D.S. 
You do not deserve to leave the country as a criminal, but you cannot stay. 
Drew sits for a moment, looking back and forth between San De and the D.S. His eyes are filling with tears, and he wipes at them. 
DREW (CONT'D) 
I'm sorry, Master. 
SAN DE 
As am I. Drew gets up and walks out of the chamber. 
EXT. COURTYARD 足 SAME NIGHT DREW WALKS BACK TO THE DORM ROOM, SLOWLY. INT. DORM ROOM 足 SAME NIGHT ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WITH THE OTHER GUYS AROUND HIM. He has just finished telling the disciples what is going on. 
They are shocked. GAO Why only you? 
Drew shrugs and goes over to his bed, lying down with a sigh. LI The D.S. always told us that we're all responsible for what happens. WU It's not fair. DREW It doesn't have to be fair... DISSOLVE TO: ANGLE ON DREW LYING IN THE DARK Everyone else is asleep, but not Drew. He is staring at the ceiling. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. DORM ROOM 足 MORNING 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WAKING UP TO AN EMPTY ROOM. 
Everyone is gone already, their beds made up. Drew gets up quickly and gathers up his few things. He puts on his New 
York Yankees cap and shoulders his back pack, then looks around the room one last time. 
DREW 
I hate long goodbyes anyway... 
He exits the room.

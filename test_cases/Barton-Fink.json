{"test1_input": "CHARLIE Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face!  This is still home for me \u0096 I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later... \nBarton rises and walks over to his writing table. \nCHARLIE ...And \u0096 mark my words \u0096 by the time I get back you're picture'll be finished. I know it. \nBarton scribbles on a notepad and turns to hand it to Charlie. \nBARTON New York can be pretty cruel to strangers, Charlie. If you need a home-cooked meal you just look up Morris and Lillian Fink.  They live on Fulton Street with my uncle Dave. \nWe hear a tacky, tearing sound. \nBarton looks toward the door. \nCharlie rises and walks over to the stand next to where Barton sits. \nThe two staring men form an odd, motionless tableau \u0096 the slight, bespectacled man seated; the big man standing in a hunch with his hands on his thighs; their heads close together. \nTHEIR POV \nA swath of wallpaper in the entryway has pulled away from the wall. It sags and nods. \nCHARLIE (off) Christ! \nTHE TWO MEN \nFrozen, looking. \nCHARLIE ...Your room does that too? \nBARTON I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper. \nCHARLIE What a dump... \nHe heads for the door and Barton follows. \nCHARLIE ...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you. \nBARTON Well... \nCHARLIE Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York. \nBARTON What do you mean? \nCHARLIE This kind of heat. It's pathetic. \nBARTON Well, I guess you pick your poison. \nCHARLIE So they say. \nBARTON Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye. \nCHARLIE Course not, compadre. You'll see me again. \nBarton closes the door. \nHe goes back to the desk, sits, and stares at the typewriter. After a beat he tips back in his chair and looks up at the ceiling. \nWe hear a loud thump. \nHIS POV \nThe ceiling \u0096 a white, seamless space. \nAs we track in the thumping continues \u0096 slowly, rhythmically, progressively louder \u0096 the effect, it seems, of odd doings upstairs. \nLOOKING DOWN ON BARTON \nFrom a high angle, tipped back in his chair, staring at the ceiling. \nWe track slowly down toward him. The thumping continues, growing louder, sharper. \nHIS POV \nMoving in on the ceiling. We close in on an unblemished area and cease to have any sense of movement. \nWith a blur something huge and dark sweeps across the frame to land with a deafening crash, and an instant later it is gone, having left a huge black \"T\" stamped into the white ceiling. \nWe are pulling back from the white, past the metal prongs of the key-strike area on a typewriter. More letters appear rapid-fire, growing smaller as the pull back continues. The thumpimg becomes the clacking of the typewriter. \nBEN GEISLER \nIs emerging from his office.  As he enters the secretary stops typing, glances down at a slip of paper, and murmurs tonelessly, without looking up: \nSECRETARY Barton Fink. \nGEISLER Yeah. Fink. Come in. \nThe clack of the typewriter resumes as Barton rises. \nGEISLER'S OFFICE \nThe two men enter. \n", "test1_true": "Geisler sits behind his desk. \nGEISLER Wuddya got for me \u0096 what the hell happened to your face? \nBARTON Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite. \nGEISLER Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps \u0096 this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me? \nBARTON Well I... \nGEISLER On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got? \nBARTON Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started\u0096 \nGEISLER Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?! \nBARTON Well not much. \nGeisler leaps to his feet and paces. \nGEISLER What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill! \nBARTON I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob- \nGEISLER Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this! \nBARTON Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew- \nGEISLER Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse! \nBARTON He's a great writer \u0096 \nGEISLER A souse! \nBARTON You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write- \nGEISLER Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week! \nBARTON But... I thought no one cared about this picture. \nGEISLER You thought! Where'd you get THAT from?  You thought! I don't know what the hell you said to Lipnik, but the sonofabitch LIKES you! You understand that, Fink? He LIKES you! He's taken an interest. NEVER make Lipnik like you. NEVER! \nSome puzzlement shows through Barton's weariness. \nBARTON I don't understand- \nGEISLER Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him? \nBARTON I didn't say anything- \nGEISLER Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going \u0096 don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow. \nBARTON I can't write anything by tomorrow. \nGEISLER Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake. \nBARTON Well what do I tell him? \nGeisler rubs a temple, studies Barton for a beat, then picks up a telephone. \nGEISLER Projection... \nAs he waits, Geisler gives Barton a withering stare. It continues throughout the phone conversation. \nGEISLER ... Jerry? Ben Geisler here. Any of the screening rooms free this afternoon?...  Good, book it for me. A writer named Fink is gonna come in and you're gonna show him wrestling pictures... I don't give a shit which ones! WRESTLING pictures!  Wait a minute- isn't Victor Sjoderberg shooting one now?... Show him some of the dailies on that. \nHe slams down the phone. \nGEISLER ...This ought to give you some ideas. \nHe jots an address on a piece of paper and hands it to Barton. \nGEISLER ...Eight-fifteen tomorrow morning at Lipnik's house. Ideas. Broad strokes. Don't cross me, Fink. \nSCREEN \nBlack-and-white footage. A middle-aged man with a clapstick enters and shouts: \nCLAPPER DEVIL ON THE CANVAS, twelve baker take one. \nClap! The clapper withdraws. The angle is on a corner of the ring, where an old corner man stands behind his charge, a huge man in tights who is a little too flabby to be a real athlete. His hair is plastered against his bullet skull and he has a small mustache. \nVOICE Action. \nThe wrestler rises from his stool and heads toward center ring and the camera. He affects a German accent: \nWRESTLER I will destroy him! \nHe passes the camera. \nVOICE Cut. \nFlash frames. \n", "test1_id": 2703, "test2_input": "AUDREY It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes? \nBARTON No, but the whole goddamn \u0096 Audrey? Have you ever had to read any of Bill's wrestling scenarios? \nAudrey laughs. \nAUDREY Yes, I'm afraid I have. \nBARTON What are they like? What are they about? \nAUDREY Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect.  Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild.  The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited! \nShe laughs \u0096 then stops, realizing that she has laughed. She looks at Barton. \nAUDREY ...Barton. \nShe shakes her head. \nAUDREY ...Look, it's really just a formula. You don't have to type your soul into it.  We'll invent some names and a new setting.  I'll help you and it won't take any time at all. I did it for Bill so many times \u0096 \nBarton's pacing comes up short. \nBARTON Did what for Bill? \nGuardedly: \nAUDREY Well... THIS. \nBARTON You wrote his scripts for him? \nAUDREY Well, the basic ideas were frequently his- \nBARTON You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his \u0096 what about before that? \nAUDREY Before what? \nBARTON Before Bill came to Hollywood. \nAudrey is clearly reluctant to travel this path. \nAUDREY Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak- \nBARTON What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary? \nAUDREY Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project- \nBARTON I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote! \nAUDREY Barton! \nBARTON I want to know! \nAUDREY Barton, honestly, only the last couple- \nBARTON Hah! \nAUDREY And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking- \nBARTON I'll bet. Jesus \u0096 \"The grand productive days.\" What a goddamn phony. \nHe resumes pacing. \nBARTON ...W.P. Mayhew.  William Goddamn Phony Mayhew. All his guff about escape. Hah!  I'LL say he escaped! \nBarton sighs and looks at his watch. \nBARTON ...Well, we don't have much time. \nHe sits down next to Audrey. Audrey's tone is gentle. \nAUDREY It'll be fine... Don't judge him, Barton.  Don't condescend to him... \nShe strokes Barton's hair. \nAUDREY ...It's not as simple as you think. I helped Bill most by appreciating him, by understanding him. We all need understanding, Barton. Even you, tonight, it's all you really need... \nShe kisses him. \nAs Barton tentatively responds, we are panning away. \nWe frame up on the door to the bathroom and track in toward the sink. We can hear the creak of bedsprings and Audrey and Barton's breath, becoming labored. \nThe continuing track brings us up to and over the lid of the sink to frame up its drain, a perfect black circle in the porcelain white.  We track up to the drain and are enveloped by it as the sound of lovemaking mixes into the groaning of pipes. \nBLACK \nFADE IN: \nBARTON \nThe hum of a mosquito brings us out of the black and we are looking down at Barton, in bed, asleep. It is dawn. \nBarton's eyes snap open. \n", "test2_true": "The white ceiling. A humming black speck flits across the white. \nBARTON \nSlowly, cautiously, he props himself up, his look following the sound of the mosquito. \nHis gaze travels down and to one side and is arrested as the hum stops. \nHIS POV \nAudrey lies facing away on her side of the bed, half covered by a blanket. \nBARTON \nGingerly, he reaches over and draws the blanket down Audrey's back. \nHIS POV \nThe alabaster white of Audrey's back. \nThe mosquito is feeding on it. \nEXTREME CLOSE ON BARTON'S EYES \nLooking. \nEXTREME CLOSE ON THE MOSQUITO \nSwelling with blood. \nWIDER \nAs Barton's hand comes through frame and slaps Audrey's back. \nShe doesn't react. \nBarton draws his hand away. Audrey's back is smeared with blood. \nON BARTON \nHe looks at his hand. \nHIS POV \nHis hand is dripping with blood. Too much blood. \nBACK TO BARTON \nEyes wide, he looks down at the bed. \nHIS POV \nBlood seeps up into the sheet beneath the curve of Audrey's back. \nBARTON \nHe pulls Audrey's shoulder. \nAUDREY \nShe rolls onto her back. Her eyes are wide and lifeless. \nHer stomach is nothing but blood. The top sheet, drawn to her waist is drenched red and clings to her body. \nBARTON \nHe screams. \nHe screams again. \nWe hear rapid and heavy footfalls next door, a door opening and closing, and then a loud banging on Barton's door. \nBarton's head spins towards the door. He is momentarily frozen. \nAnother knock. \nBarton leaps to his feet and hurries to the door. \nTHE DOORWAY \nOver Barton's shoulder as he cracks the door. \nCharlie stands in the hall in his boxer shorts and a sleeveless tee. \nCHARLIE Are you all right? \nBarton stares dumbly for a moment. \nCHARLIE ...Can I come in? \nBARTON No!... I'm fine. Thank you. \nCHARLIE Are you sure \u0096 \n", "test2_id": 2704, "test3_input": "DEUTSCH Got a couple questions to ask ya. \nMASTRIONOTTI What do you do, Fink? \nStill hoarse: \nBARTON I write. \nDEUTSCH Oh yeah? What kind of write? \nBARTON Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures. \nMASTRIONOTTI Big fuckin' deal. \nDEUTSCH You want my partner to kiss your ass? \nMASTRIONOTTI Would that be good enough for ya? \nBARTON No, I \u0096 I didn't mean to sound \u0096 \nDEUTSCH What DID you mean? \nBARTON I \u0096 I've got respect for \u0096 for working guys, like you \u0096 \nMASTRIONOTTI Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605? \nBARTON Yeah. \nDEUTSCH How long you been up there, Fink? \nBARTON A week, eight, nine days \u0096 \nMASTRIONOTTI Is this multiple choice? \nBARTON Nine days \u0096 Tuesday \u0096 \nDEUTSCH You know this slob? \nHe is holding a small black-and-white photograph out toward Barton. \nThere is a long beat as Barton studies the picture. \nBARTON ...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me. \nMASTRIONOTTI That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you. \nDEUTSCH Ever talk to him? \nBARTON ...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows. \nMASTRIONOTTI Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers. \nDEUTSCH His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt. \nMASTRIONOTTI Also known as Madman Mundt. \nDEUTSCH He's a little funny in the head. \nBARTON What did... What did he \u0096 \nMASTRIONOTTI Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off. \nDEUTSCH Yeah, he's funny that way. \nBARTON I... \nMASTRIONOTTI Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives. \nDEUTSCH Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz. \nMASTRIONOTTI Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,. \nDEUTSCH All of which he's now missin'. \nMASTRIONOTTI Well, some of his throat was there. \nDEUTSCH Physician, heal thyself. \nMASTRIONOTTI Good luck with no fuckin' head. \nDEUTSCH Anyway. \nMASTRIONOTTI Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc. \nDEUTSCH Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description? \nMASTRIONOTTI But, you know, with the head still on. \nBARTON ...No. I never saw him with anyone else. \nDEUTSCH So. You talked to Mundt, what about? \nBARTON Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business. \n", "test3_true": "DEUTSCH Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers. \nMASTRIONOTTI No reputable company would hire a guy like that. \nBARTON Well that's what he said. \nDEUTSCH What else? \nBARTON He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, really... He... He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures. \nMastrionotti looks at Deutsch. Deutsch looks at Mastrionotti. After a beat, Mastrionotti looks back at Barton. \nMASTRIONOTTI Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful. \nDEUTSCH Ya see how he's not writing it down? \nMASTRIONOTTI Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it? \nBARTON Yeah. \nMastrionotti gets to his feet, looking around the lobby. \nMASTRIONOTTI Yeah, I didn't think this dump was restricted. \nHe digs in his pocket. \nMASTRIONOTTI ...Mundt has disappeared. I don't think he'll be back. But... \nHe hands Barton a card. \nMASTRIONOTTI ...give me a call if you see him. Or if you remember something that isn't totally idiotic. \nBARTON'S ROOM \nWe are tracking toward the paper-wrapped parcel that sits on the nightstand next to Barton's bed. \nBarton enters and picks it up. He holds it for a beat, looking at it, then brings it over to the secretary and sits. \nHe shakes it. \nNo sound; whatever is inside is well packed. \nBarton holds it up to his ear and listens for a long beat, as if it were a seashell and he is listening for the surf. \nFinally he puts it on his desk, beneath the picture of the bathing beauty, and starts typing, quickly and steadily. \nDISSOLVE \nTHROUGH TO: \nREVERSE \nSome time later; Barton still types. He is face to us; beyond him we can see the bed with its rust-colored stain. \nThe phone rings. Barton ignores it. It continues to ring. \nBarton rises and exits frame; we hold on to the bed in the background. We hear Barton's footsteps on the bathroom tile as the phone continues ringing. \nBarton sits back into frame stuffing cotton into each ear. He resumes typing. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nBarton typing. The desk trembles under the working of the typewriter.  Charlie's parcel chatters. \nBarton takes a finished page out of the carriage and places it face down on the growing stack to his right. He feeds in a new page. We hear the muted ding of the elevator down the hall. Barton resumes typing. \nWe hear a knock on Barton's door. Barton does not react, apparently not hearing. \nTHE DOORWAY \nWe are close on the bottom of the door. Someone in the hallway is sliding a note beneath the door; then his shadow disappears and his footsteps recede. \nThe note is a printed message headed: \"While You Were Out... \" Underneath are the printed words: \"You were called by\" and, handwritten in the space following: \"Mr. Ben Geisler.\" \nHandwritten below, in the message space: \n\"Thank you. Lipnik loved your meeting. Keep up the good work.\" \nBarton's offscreen typing continues steadily. \nFADE OUT \nHALLWAY \nA perfectly symmetrical wide low angle shot of the empty hall.  Shoes are set put in front of each door except for one in the middle background. \nAt the cut in we hear faint, regular typing. \nWe hold for a beat. There is no motion. The long, empty hall. The distant typing. \nWe hold. \nThe typing stops. There is a beat of quiet. \n", "test3_id": 2705}

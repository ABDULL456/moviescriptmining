{"train": "BARTON FINK \nBARTON FINK \nScreenplay \nBy \nEthan Coen & Joel Coen \nFADE IN: \nON BARTON FINK \nHe is a bespectacled man in his thirties, hale but somewhat bookish. He stands, tuxedoed, in the wings of a theater, looking out at the stage, listening intently to end of a performance. \nIn the shadows behind him an old stagehand leans against a flat, expressionlessly smoking a cigarette, one hand on a thick rope that hangs from the ceiling. \nThe voices of the performing actors echo in from the offscreen stage: \nACTOR I'm blowin' out of here, blowin' for good.  I'm kissin' it all goodbye, these four stinkin' walls, the six flights up, the el that roars by at three A.M. like a castiron wind. Kiss 'em goodbye for me, Maury! I'll miss 'em \u0096 like hell I will! \nACTRESS Dreaming again! \nACTOR Not this time, Lil! I'm awake now, awake for the first time in years. Uncle Dave said it: Daylight is a dream if you've lived with your eyes closed. Well my eyes are open now! I see that choir, and I know they're dressed in rags! But we're part of that choir, both of us \u0096 yeah, and you, Maury, and Uncle Dave too! \nMAURY The sun's coming up, kid. They'll be hawking the fish down on Fulton Street. \nACTOR Let 'em hawk. Let 'em sing their hearts out. \nMAURY That's it, kid. Take that ruined choir.  Make it sing! \nACTOR So long, Maury. \nMAURY So long. \nWe hear a door open and close, then approaching footsteps. A tall, dark actor in a used tweed suit and carrying a beat-up valise passes in front of Barton: From offscreen stage: \nMAURY We'll hear from that kid. And I don't mean a postcard. \nThe actor sets the valise down and then stands waiting int he shadows behind Barton. \nAn older man in work clothes \u0096 not wardrobe \u0096 passes in front of Barton from the other direction, pauses at the edge of the stage and cups his hands to his mouth. \nOLDER MAN FISH! FRESH FISH! \nAs the man walks back off the screen: \nLILY Let's spit on our hands and get to work.  It's late, Maury. \nMAURY Not any more Lil... \nBarton mouths the last line in sync with the offscreen actor: \nMAURY ...It's early. \nWith this the stagehand behind Barton furiously pulls the rope hand-over-hand and we hear thunderous applause and shouts of \"Bravo!\" \nAs the stagehand finishes bringing the curtain down, somewhat muting the applause, the backstage actor trots out of frame toward the stage. \nThe stagehand pulls on an adjacent rope, bringing the curtain back up and unmuting the applause. \nBarton Fink seems dazed. He has been joined by two other men, both dressed in tuxedos, both beaming toward the stage. \nBARTON'S POV \nLooking across a tenement set at the backs of the cast as the curtain rises on the enthusiastic house. The actors take their bows and the cry of \"Author, Author\" goes up from the crowd. \nThe actors turn to smile at Barton in the wings. \nBARTON \nHe hesitates, unable to take it all in. \nHe is gently nudged toward the stage by the two tuxedoed gentlemen. \nAs he exits toward the stage the applause is deafening. \nTRACKING SHOT \nPushing a maitre 'd who looks back over his shoulder as he leads the way through the restaurant. \nMAITRE 'D Your table is ready, Monsieur Fink... several members of your party have already arrived... \nREVERSE \nPulling Barton \nFINK Is Garland Stanford here? \nMAITRE 'D He called to say he'd be a few minutes late... Ah, here we are... \nTRACKING IN \nHe leans back and chuckles ruefully. \nBARTON ...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind. \nGARLAND Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism \u0096 if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath. \nBarton glumly lights a cigarette and gazes out across the floor. \nGarland studies him. \nGARLAND ...Look, they love you, kid \u0096 everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald? \nBARTON No, what did it say? \nGARLAND Take my copy. You're the toast of Broadway and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash \u0096 strike that, a lot of cash. \nGarland looks at Barton for a reaction, but gets none. \nGARLAND ...The common man'll still be here when you get back. What the hell, they might even have one or two of 'em out in Hollywood. \nAbsently: \nBARTON ...That's a rationalization, Garland. \nGarland smiles gently. \nGARLAND Barton, it was a joke. \nWe hear a distant rumble. It builds slowly and we cut to: \nA GREAT WAVE \nCrushing against the Pacific shore. \nThe roar of the surf slips away as we dissolve to: \nHOTEL LOBBY \nA high wide shot from the front door, looking down across wilting potted palms, brass cuspidors turning green, ratty wing chairs; the fading decor is deco-gone-to-seed. \nAmber light, afternoon turning to evening, slopes in from behind us, washing the derelict lobby with golden highlights. \nBarton Fink enters frame from beneath the camera and stops in the middle foreground to look across the lobby. \nWe are framed on his back, his coat and hat. The lobby is empty.  There is a suspended beat as Barton takes it in. \nBarton moves toward the front desk. \nTHE REVERSE \nAs Barton stops at the empty desk. He hits a small silver bell next to the register. Its ring-out goes on and on without losing volume. \nAfter a long beat there is a dull scuffle of shoes on stairs. Barton, puzzled, looks around the empty lobby, then down at the floor behind the front desk. \nA TRAP DOOR \nIt swings open and a young man in a faded maroon uniform, holding a shoebrush and a shoe \u0096 not one of his own \u0096 climbs up from the basement. \nHe closes the trap door, steps up to the desk and sticks his finger out to touch the small silver bell, finally muting it. \nThe lobby is now silent again. \nCLERK Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir? \nBARTON I'm checking in. Barton Fink. \nThe clerk flips through cards on the desk. \nCLERK F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh? \nBARTON Must be. \nCLERK Okay then, everything seems to be in order. Everything seems to be in order. \nHe is turning to a register around for Barton to sign. \nCLERK ...Are you a tranz or a rez? \nBARTON Excuse me? \nCLERK Transient or resident? \nBARTON I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely. \nCLERK Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet. \nBARTON Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service? \nCLERK Kitchen closes at eight but I'm the night clerk. I can always ring out for sandwiches. \nThe clerk is scribbling something on the back of an index card. \nCLERK ...Though we provide privacy for the residential guest, we are also a full service hotel including complimentary shoe shine. My name is Chet. \nBARTON ...Who is this? \nVOICE Chet! \nBARTON ...Who? \nVOICE Chet! From downstairs! \nBarton wearily rubs the bridge of his nose. \nVOICE ...How d'ya like your room! \nA PILLOW \nAs Barton's head drops down into frame against it. \nHe reaches over and turns off the bedside light. \nHe lies back and closes his eyes. \nA long beat. \nWe hear a faint hum, growing louder. \nBarton opens his eyes. \nHIS POV \nA naked, peeling ceiling.  The hum \u0096 a mosquito, perhaps \u0096 stops. \nBARTON \nHis eyes move this way and that. After a silent beat, he shuts them again. \nAfter another silent beat, we hear \u0096 muffled, probably from am adjacent room \u0096 a brief, dying laugh. It is sighing and weary, like the end of a laughing fit, almost a sob. \nSilence again. \nWe hear the rising mosquito hum. \nFADE OUT \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE \nBarton Fink is ushered into a large, light office by an obsequious middle- aged man in a sagging suit. \nThere are mosquito bites on Barton's face. \nREVERSE \nFrom behind a huge white desk, a burly man in an expensive suit gets to his feet and strides across the room. \nMAN Is that him?! Barton Fink?!  Lemme put my arms around this guy! \nHe bear-hugs Barton. \nMAN ...How the hell are ya? Good trip? \nHe separates without waiting for an answer. \nMAN My name is Jack Lipnik. I run this dump. You know that \u0096 you read the papers. \nLipnik is lumbering back to his desk. \nMAN Lou treating you all right? Got everything you need?  What the hell's the matter with your face? What the hell's the matter with his face, Lou? \nBARTON It's not as bad as it looks; just a mosquito in my room \u0096 \nLIPNIK Place okay? \nTo Lou: \nLIPNIK ...Where did we put him? \nBARTON I'm at the Earle. \nLIPNIK Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place. \nBARTON Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less... \nLIPNIK Less Hollywood?  Sure, say it, it's not a dirty word. Sat whatever the hell you want. The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures. You don't believe me, take a look at your paycheck at the end of every week \u0096 that's what we think of the writer. (to Lou) ...so what kind of pictures does he like? \nLOU Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik. \nLIPNIK How's about it, Bart? \nBARTON To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik \u0096 \nLIPNIK That's okay, that's okay, that's okay \u0096 that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing \u0096 although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee? \nBARTON ...Yes, thank you. \nLIPNIK Lou. \nHIS POV \nThe empty hallway, a pair of shoes before each door. At the end of the hall a dim red bulb burns over the door to the staircase, punctuating the sick yellow glow of the line of wall sconces. \nThe laughter, though still faint, is more resonant in the empty hall. \nPerhaps its quality has changed, or perhaps simply because it is so insistent, the laughter now might be taken for weeping. \nBarton pauses, trying to interpret the sound. He slowly withdraws into his room. \nHIS ROOM \nBarton looks down at his typewriter for a beat. The laughter/weeping continues. \nHe walks over to his bed, sits down and picks up the house phone. \nBARTON Hello... Chet? This is Barton Fink in room 605. Yes, there's uh, there's someone in the room next door to mine, 604, and he's uh... He's uh... making a lot of... noise. \nAfter a beat: \nBARTON ...Thank you. \nHe cradles the phone. The laughter continues for a moment or two, then abruptly stops with the muffled sound of the telephone ringing next door. \nBarton looks at the wall. \nThe muffled sound of a man talking. \nThe sound of the earpiece being pronged. \nMuffled footsteps next door. \nThe sound of the neighbor's door opening and shutting. \nFootsteps approaching the hall. \nA hard, present knock at Barton's door. \nBarton hesitates for a beat, then rises to go get the door. \nON THE DOOR \nAs Barton opens it. Standing in the hall is a large man \u0096 a very large man \u0096 in short sleeves, suspenders, and loosened tie. His face is slightly flushed, with the beginnings of sweat. \nMAN Did you... Somebody just complained... \nHastily: \nBARTON No, I didn't \u0096 I mean, I did call down, not to complain exactly, I was just concerned that you might \u0096 not that it's my business, but that you might be in some kind of... distress. You see, I was trying to work, and it's, well, it was difficult \u0096 \nMAN Yeah. I'm damn sorry, if I bothered you.  The damn walls here, well, I just apologize like hell... \nHe sticks his hand out. \nMAN ...My name's Charlie Meadows. I guess we're neighbors... \nWithout reaching for the hand. \nBARTON Barton Fink. \nUnfazed, Charlie Meadows unpockets a flask. \nCHARLIE Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink. \nBARTON That's all right, really, thank you. \nCHARLIE All right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there. Look, the liquor's good, wuddya say? \nAs he enters: \nCHARLIE ... You got a glass? It's the least I can do. \nBARTON Okay... a quick one, sure... \nHe gets two glasses from the wash basin.  Charlie sits down on the edge of the bed and uncorks his flask. \nCHARLIE Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door. \nBARTON That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work \u0096 \nCHARLIE What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking? \nBARTON Well, I'm a writer, actually. \nCHARLIE You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine. \nBARTON Can be. Not easy, but \u0096 \nCHARLIE Damned difficult, I'd imagine. \nAs he hands Charlie a glass: \nBARTON And what's your line, Mr. Meadows? \nCHARLIE ...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world. \nBARTON See you, Charlie. \nCharlie closes the door and is gone. \nBarton goes back to his desk and sits. \nMuffled, we can hear the door of the adjacent room opening and closing. \nBarton looks at the wall. \nHIS POV \nThe bathing beauty. \nFrom offscreen we hear a sticky, adhesive-giving-way sound. \nBARTON He looks around to the opposite \u0096 bed \u0096 wall. \nHIS POV \nThe wallpaper is lightly sheened with moisture from the heat. \nOne swath of wallpaper is just finishing sagging away from the wall. About three feet of the wall, where it meets the ceiling, is exposed. \nThe strip of wallpaper, its glue apparently melted, sags and nods above the bed. It glistens yellow, like a fleshy tropical flower. \nBACK TO BARTON \nHe goes over to the bed and steps up onto it. He smooths the wallpaper back up against the wall. \nHe looks at his hand. \nHIS HAND \nSticky with tacky yellow wall sweat. \nHe wipes it onto his shirt. \nWe hear a faint mosquito hum. \nBarton looks around. \nFADE OUT \nA TYPEWRITER Whirring at high speed. The keys strike too quickly for us to make out the words. \nSLOW TRACK IN \nOn Barton, sitting on a couch in an office anteroom, staring blankly.  Distant phones ring. Barton's eyes are tired and bloodshot. \nHIS POV \nA gargoyle secretary sits typing a document. \nThe office door opens in the background and a short middle- aged man in a dark suit emerges. \nTo his secretary: \nEXECUTIVE I'm eating on the lot today \u0096 \nHe notices Barton. \nEXECUTIVE ...Who's he? \nThe secretary looks over from her typing to consult a slip of paper on her desk. \nSECRETARY Barton Fink, Mr. Geisler. \nGEISLER More please. \nBARTON I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the \u0096 \nGEISLER Ever act? \nBARTON ...Huh? No, I'm \u0096 \nGEISLER We need Indians for a Norman Steele western. \nBARTON I'm a writer. Ted O \u0096 \nGEISLER Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians. \nBARTON I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on. \nGEISLER What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl. \nBARTON Then who should I talk to? \nGeisler gives a hostile stare. Without looking at her, he addresses the secretary: \nGEISLER Get me Lou Breeze. \nReacting to barton's look as he washes his hands. This time, a curt nod accompanies his pleasant smile. \nBARTON \nLooks back down, then up again. \nTHE MAN \nExtends a dripping hand. \nMAN Bill Mayhew. Sorry about the odor. \nHis speech is softly accented, from the South. \nBARTON Barton Fink. \nThey shake, then return to their ablutions. \nWe hold on Barton as we hear Mayhew's faucet being turned off and his foot-steps receding. For some reason, Barton's eyes are widening. \nBARTON ...Jesus. W.P.! \nThe dapper little man stops and turns. \nMAYHEW I beg your pardon? \nBARTON W.P. Mayhew? The writer? \nMAYHEW Just Bill, please. \nBarton stands with his back to the sink, facing the little man, his hands dripping onto the floor. There is a short pause. Barton is strangely agitated, his voice halting but urgent. \nBARTON Bill!... \nMayhew cocks his head with a politely patient smile. Finally Barton brings out: \nBARTON ...You're the finest novelist of our time. \nMayhew leans against a stall. \nMAYHEW Why thank you, son, how kind. Bein' occupied here in the worship of Mammon, I haven't had the chance yet to see your play \u0096 \nHe smiles at Barton's surprise. \nMAYHEW ...Yes, Mistuh Fink, some of the news reaches us in Hollywood. \nHe is taking out a flask and unscrewing its lid. \nBARTON Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood. \nMAYHEW All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust. \nHe clears his throat, takes a swig from the flask, and waves it at Barton. \nMAYHEW ...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink? \nBARTON It's still a little early for me. \nMAYHEW So be it. \nHe knocks back some more. \nBARTON ...Bill, if I'm imposing you should say so, I know you're very busy \u0096 I just, uh... I just wonder if I could ask you a favor... That is to say, uh... have you ever written a wrestling picture? \nMayhew eyes him appraisingly, and at length clears his throat. \nMAYHEW ...You are drippin', suh. \nBarton looks down at his hands, then pulls a rough brown paper towel from a dispenser. \nMayhew sighs: \nMAYHEW ...Mistuh Fink, they have not invented a genre of picture that Bill Mayhew has not, at one time or othuh, been invited to essay. I have taken my stabs at the wrastlin' form, as I have stabbed at so many others, and with as little success. I gather that you are a fresh-man here, eager for an upperclassman's council. However, just at the moment... \nHe waves his flask. \nMAYHEW ...I have drinkin' to do. Why don't you stop at my bungalow, which is numbah fifteen, later on this afternoon... \nHe turns to leave. \nMAYHEW ...and we will discuss wrastlin' scenarios and other things lit'rary. \nTHE NUMBER \"15\" \nWe are close on brass numerals tacked up on a white door. \nMuted, from inside, we hear Mayhew's voice \u0096 enraged, bellowing.  We hear things breaking. Softer, we hear a woman's voice, its tone placating. \nREVERSE TRACKING SLOWLY IN \nOn Barton, standing in front of the door. \nThe noise abates for a moment. We hear the woman's voice again. \nON BARTON \nSmoothing up the second swath. \nAs he pushes in the second tack he pauses, listening. \nMuffled, through the wall, we can hear a woman moaning. \nAfter a motionless beat, Barton eases his ear against the wall. \nCLOSE ON BARTON \nAs his ear meets the wall. \nThe woman's moaning continues. We hear the creaking of bedsprings and her partner, incongruously giggling. \nBarton grimaces, gets down off the bed and crosses to the secretary, where he sits. He stares at the paper in the carriage. \nHIS POV \nThe blank part of the page around the key-strike area, under the metal prongs that hold the paper down. \nWe begin to hear moaning again. \nBACK TO BARTON \nStill looking; sweating. \nHIS POV \nTracking in on the paper, losing the prongs from frame so that we are looking at the pure unblemished white of the page. \nThe moaning is cut short by two sharp knocks. \nTHE DOOR \nAs it swings open.  Charlie Meadows leans in, smiling. \nCHARLIE Howdy, neighbor. \nBARTON Charlie. How are you. \nCHARLIE Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by. \nBARTON Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet \u0096 what happened to your ear? \n\u0096 for Charle's left ear is plugged with cotton wadding. As he enters: \nCHARLIE Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious. \nBARTON Seen a doctor? \nCharlie gives a dismissive wave. \nCHARLIE Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one. \nBARTON No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat. \nCharlie perches on the corner of the bed. \nCHARLIE Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart? \nBARTON Nope. \nCHARLIE I myself have yet to be lassoed. \nHe takes his flask out. \nCHARLIE ...Got a sweetheart? \nBARTON No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair... \nCHARLIE Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. In my experience, they pretend to give it, but it's generally a smoke- screen for demanding it back \u0096 with interest. How about family, Bart? How're you fixed in that department? \nBarton smiles. \nBARTON My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle. \nCHARLIE Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now... \nHe taps himself on the head, chuckling. \nCHARLIE ...What's the expression \u0096 me myself and I. \nBARTON Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but... \nHe shrugs. \nCHARLIE Mm... You're no stranger to loneliness, then. I guess I got no beef; especially where the dames are concerned. In my line of work I get opportunities galore \u0096 always on the wing, you know what I'm saying. I could tell stories to curl your hair \u0096 but it looks like you've already heard 'em! \nHe laughs at his reference to Barton's curly hair, and pulls a dog-eared photograph from his wallet. As he hands it to Barton: \nCHARLIE ...That's me in Kansas City, plying my trade. \nMAYHEW Silent upon a hill in Darien! \nAudrey bursts into tears. Barton puts his arms around her and she leans into him. \nBARTON Audrey, you can't put up with this. \nGradually, she collects herself, wiping her tears. \nAUDREY ...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him! \nBARTON What?! He's a son of a bitch! \nAUDREY No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed. \nBARTON Really?... \nHe considers this for a moment, but his anger returns. \nBARTON ...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior. \nAUDREY He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does. \nBARTON Okay, but that doesn't excuse his \u0096 \nAUDREY Barton. Empathy requires... understanding. \nBARTON What. What don't I understand? \nAudrey gazes at him. \nMAYHEW \nHe is very distant now, weaving but somehow dignified in his light summer suit. \"Old Black Joe\" floats back to us in the twilight. \nFADE OUT \nBARTON'S HOTEL ROOM \nFrom a high angle, booming down on Barton. \nThe room is dark. Barton lies fully clothed, stretched out on the bed, asleep. The hum of the mosquito fades up in the stillness. \nSuddenly Barton slaps his cheek. His eyes open, but he remains still. The hum fades up again.  Barton reaches over and turns on the bedside lamp. His eyes shift this way and that as he waits, listening. \nThe hum fades down to silence. \nBarton's eyes shift. \nHIS POV \nThe typewriter sits on the secretary, a piece of paper rolled halfway through the carriage. \nTHE TYPEWRITER \nBarton enters frame and sits down in front of the typewriter. \nHIS POV \nNext to the typewriter are several crumpled pieces of paper. The page in the carriage reads: \nFADE IN: \nA TENEMENT HOTEL \nOn the Lower East Side. We can faintly hear the cry of the fishmongers. It is too early for us to hear traffic; later, perhaps, we will. \nBACK TO BARTON \nLooking down at the page. \nCLOSE ON BARTON'S FEET \nSwinging in the legwell. \nOne foot idly swings over to nudge a pair of nicely shined shoes from where they rest, under the secretary, into the legwell. \nWe hear typing start. \nTHE PAGE \nA new paragraph being started: \"A large man...\" \nBARTON'S FEET \nAs he slides them into the shoes. \nTHE PAGE \n\"A large man in tights...\" \nThe typing stops. \nBARTON \nAUDREY It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes? \nBARTON No, but the whole goddamn \u0096 Audrey? Have you ever had to read any of Bill's wrestling scenarios? \nAudrey laughs. \nAUDREY Yes, I'm afraid I have. \nBARTON What are they like? What are they about? \nAUDREY Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect.  Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild.  The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited! \nShe laughs \u0096 then stops, realizing that she has laughed. She looks at Barton. \nAUDREY ...Barton. \nShe shakes her head. \nAUDREY ...Look, it's really just a formula. You don't have to type your soul into it.  We'll invent some names and a new setting.  I'll help you and it won't take any time at all. I did it for Bill so many times \u0096 \nBarton's pacing comes up short. \nBARTON Did what for Bill? \nGuardedly: \nAUDREY Well... THIS. \nBARTON You wrote his scripts for him? \nAUDREY Well, the basic ideas were frequently his- \nBARTON You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his \u0096 what about before that? \nAUDREY Before what? \nBARTON Before Bill came to Hollywood. \nAudrey is clearly reluctant to travel this path. \nAUDREY Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak- \nBARTON What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary? \nAUDREY Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project- \nBARTON I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote! \nAUDREY Barton! \nBARTON I want to know! \nAUDREY Barton, honestly, only the last couple- \nBARTON Hah! \nAUDREY And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking- \nBARTON I'll bet. Jesus \u0096 \"The grand productive days.\" What a goddamn phony. \nHe resumes pacing. \nBARTON ...W.P. Mayhew.  William Goddamn Phony Mayhew. All his guff about escape. Hah!  I'LL say he escaped! \nBarton sighs and looks at his watch. \nBARTON ...Well, we don't have much time. \nHe sits down next to Audrey. Audrey's tone is gentle. \nAUDREY It'll be fine... Don't judge him, Barton.  Don't condescend to him... \nShe strokes Barton's hair. \nAUDREY ...It's not as simple as you think. I helped Bill most by appreciating him, by understanding him. We all need understanding, Barton. Even you, tonight, it's all you really need... \nShe kisses him. \nAs Barton tentatively responds, we are panning away. \nWe frame up on the door to the bathroom and track in toward the sink. We can hear the creak of bedsprings and Audrey and Barton's breath, becoming labored. \nThe continuing track brings us up to and over the lid of the sink to frame up its drain, a perfect black circle in the porcelain white.  We track up to the drain and are enveloped by it as the sound of lovemaking mixes into the groaning of pipes. \nBLACK \nFADE IN: \nBARTON \nThe hum of a mosquito brings us out of the black and we are looking down at Barton, in bed, asleep. It is dawn. \nBarton's eyes snap open. \nBARTON No... no... \nBarton is nodding as he shuts the door in Charlie's face. \nHe walks back into the room. \nHIS POV \nAudrey's corpse, in long shot, face up on the bed. \nBARTON \nHe walks toward the bed, wheels before he reaches it, and starts back toward the door. \nHe stops short and turns back again to the room. He averts his eyes \u0096 as it happens, toward the secretary. \nHe walks stiffly over and sits, his back to Audrey. \nCLOSE ON BARTON \nAs he sits in. He stares emptily down at the desk, in shock, totally shut down. Behind him, we can see Audrey on the bed. \nHe stares for a long beat. \nStrange, involuntary noises come from his throat. He is not in control. \nBecoming aware of the noise he is making, he stops. \nHe lurches to his feet. \nTHE DOORWAY \nAs Barton enters, opens the door, and sticks his head out. \nHALLWAY \nBarton peers out the see if the coast is clear. \nHIS POV \nThe long hallway. \nIn the deep background, Chet, the night clerk, is stooping in front of a door to pick up a pair of shoes. Next to him is a castored shoe caddy. \nAll of the doorways between us and Chet are empty of shoes. \nCHET \nClose on him as, mid-stoop, he looks up. \nCHET'S POV \nUp the long hall. In the deep background a door is closing. \nCHET \nHe pauses, then straightens up and puts the shoes on the shoe caddy. It squeaks as he pushes it on down the hall. \nBARTON'S ROOM \nBarton stands at the door, listening to a very faint squeak. Eventually it becomes inaudible. \nHe cracks the door again, looks out, and exits. \nHALLWAY \nBarton goes to Charlie's room and knocks. \nFootfalls end as the door is cracked open. \nCHARLIE Barton. Are you all right? \nBARTON No... Can I come in? \nCHARLIE Why don't we go to your room- \nBARTON Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me. \nOnce again he is breathing hard. \nCharlie steps out into the hall and shuts the door behind him. \nCHARLIE Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out. \nBARTON Charlie, I'm in trouble \u0096 something horrible's happened \u0096 I've gotta call the police... \nCharlie leads him towards his room. \nBARTON ...Will you stay with me till they get here? \nCHARLIE Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it- \nHe is pushing Barton's door open, but Barton grabs an elbow to stop him. \nBACK TO BARTON \nHis neck goes rubbery. His eyes roll up. His head lolls back to hit the wall. \nBLACK \nSlap! Slap! \nWe are low on Charlie, who is following through on a slap and backing away, having aroused Barton. Charlie is now wearing pants but is still in his sleeveless tee, which has blood flecks across the belly. \nCHARLIE You passed out. \nBarton looks groggily up. \nBARTON ...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey? \nCHARLIE She's dead, Barton! If that was her name. \nTRACKING IN ON BARTON \nHe stares at Charlie. \nCHARLIE (off) Barton, listen to me. You gotta act like nothing's happened. Put this totally out of your head. I know that's hard, but your play from here on out is just to go about business as usual. Give us some time to sort this out... \nBarton looks at his watch. \nTHE WATCH \nCHARLIE (off) ...Just put it out of you head... \nTRACKING \nToward a pool set in a grand yard with shaped hedges and statuary set amid palms trees. \nSunlight glitters angrily off the water; we are approaching Jack Lipnik who sits poolside in a white deck chair. \nLIPNIK Bart! So happy to see ya! \nREVERSE \nPulling Barton, who is being escorted by Lou Breeze. \nBarton is haggard, sunken eyes squinting against too much sun. \nLIPNIK Sit! Talk! Relax for a minute, then talk!  Drink? \nAs Barton sits: \nBARTON Yeah... rye whiskey? \nLIPNIK Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway... \nHe laughs, then barks at Lou Breeze. \nLIPNIK ... Lou. \nLou exits. \nLIPNIK Anyway. Ben Geisler tells me things're going along great.  Thinks we've got a real winner in this one. And let me tell you something, I'm counting on it. I've taken an interest. Not to interfere, mind you \u0096 hardly seems necessary in your case. A writer \u0096 a storyteller \u0096 of your stature. Givitta me in bold strokes, Bart. Gimme the broad outlines. I'm sitting in the audience, the lights go down, Capitol logo comes up... you're on! \nHe beams expectantly at Barton.  Barton licks his parched lips. \nBARTON Yeah, okay... well... we fade in... \nLipnik is nodding, already involved in the story. \nBARTON ...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side... \nLIPNIK Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle! \nBARTON And then... well... \nBarton looks back out at the pool, his eyes closed to slits against the sun. He looks back at Lipnik. \nBARTON ...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik? \nLIPNIK CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings \u0096 well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town \u0096 but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things \u0096 if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool \u0096 unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool. \nLou has entered with a drink, which he sets next to Barton. Lou sits. \nBarton looks around, takes the drink, sips at it greedily, but must finally take the plunge. \nBARTON Well... to be honest, I'm never really comfortable discussing a work in progress.  I've got it all worked out in my head, but sometimes if you force it out in words \u0096 prematurely \u0096 the wrong words \u0096 well, your meaning changes, and it changes your own mind, and you never get it back \u0096 so I'd just as soon not talk about it. \nLipnik stares at him. His smile has disappeared. There is a long beat. \nLou Breeze clears his throat. He apparently feels obliged to fill the silence. \nLOU ...Mr. Fink. Never mind me. Never mind how long I've been in pictures. Mr. Lipnik has been in pictures just about since they were invented. HE practically invented them. \nLipnik has turned to look curiously at Lou. \nLOU ...Now I think if he's interested in what one of his contract employees is doing while he draws pay, I think that employee ought to tell him, if he wants to stay an employee. Right now the contents of your head are the property of Capitol Pictures, so if I were you I would speak up. And pretty goddamn fast. \nBARTON Jesus, Charlie, I... \nCHARLIE Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of. \nBARTON Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles... \nHe starts weeping \nBARTON ...that I can talk to. \nCharlie, also disturbed and unhappy, wraps both arms around Barton. \nBarton sobs unashamedly into his shoulder. Charlie is somber. \nCHARLIE It's okay... It's okay... \nBARTON Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy \u0096 like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just... \nHis breath comes in short gasping heaves. \nBARTON ...I just don't know what... to do\u0096 \nCHARLIE You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on \u0096 just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out. \nBARTON Yeah, but Charlie \u0096 \nCHARLIE Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you \u0096 well I do. Now don't argue with me. \nHe looks at Barton for a beat. \nCHARLIE ...Look, pal \u0096 can you do something for me? \nCharlie hands him his parcel. \nCHARLIE ...Keep this for me, till I get back. \nBarton, snuffling, accepts the package. \nCHARLIE ...It's just personal stuff. I don't wanna drag it with me, but I don't trust 'em downstairs, and I'd like to think it's in good hands. \nStill snuffling: \nBARTON Sure, Charlie. \nCHARLIE Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime \u0096 when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic. \nWallowing in self-pity: \nBARTON It's more than I've got. \nCHARLIE Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me... \nHe thumps his chest. \nCHARLIE ...Make me your wrestler. Then you'll lick that story of yours. \nBarton is tearfully sincere: \nBARTON Thanks, Charlie. \nCharlie solemnly thrusts out his hand. \nCHARLIE Yeah, well, see you soon, friend. You're gonna be fine. \nBarton shakes. As they walk to the door: \nBARTON You'll be back? \nCHARLIE Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back. \nBarton shuts the door behind Charlie, locks it, and turns around. \nHIS POV \nThe room. The bed. The blood-stained mattress. \nBarton walks across the room and sits carefully at the edge of the bed, avoiding the rust-colored stain. For a long beat, he sits still, but something is building inside. \nFinally, when we hear the distant ding of the elevator arriving for Charlie, it erupts: \nBarton sobs, with the unself-conscious grief of an abandoned child. \nHIGH WIDE SHOT \nBarton weeping, alone on the bed, next to the rust-colored stain. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN: \nBATHING BEAUTY \nWith the fade in, the sound of the surf mixes up. \nDEUTSCH Got a couple questions to ask ya. \nMASTRIONOTTI What do you do, Fink? \nStill hoarse: \nBARTON I write. \nDEUTSCH Oh yeah? What kind of write? \nBARTON Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures. \nMASTRIONOTTI Big fuckin' deal. \nDEUTSCH You want my partner to kiss your ass? \nMASTRIONOTTI Would that be good enough for ya? \nBARTON No, I \u0096 I didn't mean to sound \u0096 \nDEUTSCH What DID you mean? \nBARTON I \u0096 I've got respect for \u0096 for working guys, like you \u0096 \nMASTRIONOTTI Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605? \nBARTON Yeah. \nDEUTSCH How long you been up there, Fink? \nBARTON A week, eight, nine days \u0096 \nMASTRIONOTTI Is this multiple choice? \nBARTON Nine days \u0096 Tuesday \u0096 \nDEUTSCH You know this slob? \nHe is holding a small black-and-white photograph out toward Barton. \nThere is a long beat as Barton studies the picture. \nBARTON ...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me. \nMASTRIONOTTI That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you. \nDEUTSCH Ever talk to him? \nBARTON ...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows. \nMASTRIONOTTI Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers. \nDEUTSCH His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt. \nMASTRIONOTTI Also known as Madman Mundt. \nDEUTSCH He's a little funny in the head. \nBARTON What did... What did he \u0096 \nMASTRIONOTTI Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off. \nDEUTSCH Yeah, he's funny that way. \nBARTON I... \nMASTRIONOTTI Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives. \nDEUTSCH Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz. \nMASTRIONOTTI Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,. \nDEUTSCH All of which he's now missin'. \nMASTRIONOTTI Well, some of his throat was there. \nDEUTSCH Physician, heal thyself. \nMASTRIONOTTI Good luck with no fuckin' head. \nDEUTSCH Anyway. \nMASTRIONOTTI Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc. \nDEUTSCH Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description? \nMASTRIONOTTI But, you know, with the head still on. \nBARTON ...No. I never saw him with anyone else. \nDEUTSCH So. You talked to Mundt, what about? \nBARTON Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business. \nIt is broken by the sound of a door opening. It is the shoeless door in the middle background. \nA hand reaches out to place a pair of shoes in the doorway. \nThe hand withdraws. \nThe door closes. \nA short beat of silence. \nThe distant typing resumes. \nThe long empty hall. The distant typing. \nFADE OUT \nOVER THE BLACK \nWe hear the distant sound of a woman's voice, tinny and indistinct. \nWOMAN Just a minute and I'll connect you... \nFADE IN: \nCLOSE ON BARTON \nHis eyes are red-rimmed and wild. He sits on the edge of his bed holding the phone to his ear. \nHis voice is unnaturally loud: \nBARTON Hello? Operator! I can't... Oh! \nHe stops, reaches up, takes a cotton wad out of his ear. \nWe hear various clicks and clacks as the telephone lines switch, and then a distant ring. The phone rings three or four times before it is answered by a groggy voice. \nVOICE ...Hello. \nBARTON Garland, it's me. \nGARLAND Barton? What time is it? Are you all right? \nBARTON Yeah, I'm fine, Garland \u0096 I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance. \nGARLAND Okay. \nMuffled, we hear Garland speaking to someone else. \nGARLAND ...It's Barton. Calling long distance. \nBack into the receiver: \nGARLAND ...What is it Barton? Are you okay? \nBARTON I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you. \nGARLAND Go ahead, son. \nBARTON It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big. \nGARLAND What do you mean, Barton? \nBARTON Not big in the sense of large \u0096 although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done. \nGARLAND Well, I'm... glad to hear that \u0096 \nBARTON Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens. \nGARLAND ...That's fine. \nBARTON Have you read the Bible, Garland? \nGARLAND ...Barton, is everything okay? \nBARTON Yes... Isn't it? \nGARLAND Well, I'm just asking. You sound a little \u0096 \nGuardedly: \nBARTON Sound a little what? \nGARLAND Well, you just... sound a little\u0096 \nBitterly: \nBARTON Thanks, Garland. Thanks for all the encouragement. \nHe slams down the phone. \nOVER HIS SHOULDER \nA one-quarter shot on Barton from behind as he picks up the cotton wad and sticks it back in his right ear. \nBARTON'S POV \nMastrionotti is sitting on the edge of the bed reading Barton's manuscript. \nDeutsch stands in front of the desk staring at the bathing beauty. \nMASTRIONOTTI Mother: What is to become of him. Father: We'll be hearing from that crazy wrestler.  And I don't mean a postcard. Fade out. The end. \nHe looks up at Barton. \nMASTRIONOTTI ...I thought you said you were a writer. \nDEUTSCH I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it. \nBARTON Keep your filthy eyes off that. \nDeutsch turns toward Barton and throws a folded newspaper at him. \nDEUTSCH You made morning papers, Fink. \nBarton opens the paper. A headline reads: Writer Found Headless in Chavez Ravine. The story has two pictures \u0096 a studio publicity portrait of Mayhew, and a photograph of the crime scene: two plainclothes detectives stare down into a gulley as a uniformed cop restrains a pair of leashed dogs. \nMASTRIONOTTI Second one of your friends to end up dead. \nDEUTSCH You didn't tell us you knew the dame. \nWith a jerk of his thumb, Mastrionotti indicates the bloodstained bed. \nMASTRIONOTTI Sixth floor too high for you, Fink? \nDEUTSCH Give you nose bleeds? \nBarton crosses the room and sits at the foot of the bed, staring at the newspaper. \nDEUTSCH Just tell me one thing, Fink: Where'd you put their heads? \nDistractedly: \nBARTON Charlie... Charlie's back... \nMASTRIONOTTI No kidding, bright boy \u0096 we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man? \nDEUTSCH Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you. \nMASTRIONOTTI Only fry you once. \nBarton rubs his temples. \nBARTON Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me. \nDEUTSCH All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink? \nMASTRIONOTTI He teach you to do it? \nDEUTSCH You two have some sick sex thing? \nBARTON Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED! \nMASTRIONOTTI You're a sick fuck, Fink. \nDEUTSCH All right, moron, you're under arrest. \nBarton seems oblivious to the two men. \nBARTON Charlie's back. It's hot... He's back. \nDown the hall we hear the ding of the arriving elevator. \nMastrionotti cocks his head with a quizzical look. \nHe rises and walks slowly out into the hall. Deutsch wathces him go. \nHIS POV \nMastrionotti in the hallway in full shot, framed by the door, still looking puzzled. \nMASTRIONOTTI ...Fred... \nDeutsch stands and pushes his suit coat back past the gun on his hip, revealing a pair of handcuffs on his belt. He unhitches the cuffs and slips one around Barton's right wrist and the other around a loop in the wrought iron footboard of the bed. \nDEUTSCH Sit tight, Fink. \nTHE HALLWAY \nAs Deutsch joins Mastrionotti. \nDEUTSCH Why's it so goddamn hot out here? \nMASTRIONOTTI ...Fred... \nDeutsch looks where Mastrionotti is looking. \nTHE WALL \nJUMPING BACK \nWide on the hallway. Charlie Meadows has emerged from the elevator and is hellishly backlit by the flame. \nHis suit coat hangs open. His hat is pushed back on his head. From his right hand his briefcase dangles. \nHe stands motionless, facing us. There is something monumental in his posture, shoulders thrown back. \nMASTRIONOTTI \nTensed. Behind him, Deutsch gulps. \nMASTRIONOTTI There's a boy, Mundt. Put the policy case down and your mitts in the air. \nCHARLIE \nHe leans slowly down to put the briefcase on the floor. \nCLOSE ON MASTRIONOTTI \nRelax. He murmurs: \nMASTRIONOTTI He's complying. \nBACK TO CHARLIE \nHe straightens up from the briefcase, a sawed-off shotgun in his hands. \nBOOM! The shotgun spits fire. \nMastrionotti's face is peppered by buckshot and he is blown back down the hallway into Deutsch. \nBellowing fills the hallway over the roar of the fire: \nCHARLIE LOOK UPON ME! LOOK UPON ME! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE MIND!! \nTHE HALLWAY \nThe fire starts racing down the hallway. \nCLOSE STEEP ANGLE ON PATCH OF WALL \nFire races along the wall-sweat goopus. \nTRACK IN ON DEUTSCH \nHis eyes widen at Charlie and the approaching fire; his gun dangles forgotten from his right hand. \nHIS POV \nCharlie is charging down the hallway, holding his shotgun loosely in front of his chest, in double-time position. The fire races along with him. \nHe is bellowing: \nCHARLIE LOOK UPON ME! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE MIND! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE MIND! \nDEUTSCH \nTerrified, he turns and runs. \nREVERSE PULLING DEUTSCH \nAs he runs down the flaming hallway, pursued by flames, smoke, and Karl Mundt \u0096 who, also on the run, levels his shotgun. \nBOOM! \nPUSHING DEUTSCH \nHis legs and feet spout blood, paddle futilely at the air, then come down in a twisting wobble, like a car on blown tires, and pitch him helplessly to the floor. \nPULLING CHARLIE \nHe slows to a trot and cracks open the shotgun. \nPUSHING DEUTSCH \nWeeping and dragging himself forward on his elbows. \nPULLING CHARLIE \nHe slows to a walk. \nBARTON'S ROOM \nBarton strains at his handcuffs. \nHIS POV \nThrough the open doorway we see Charlie pass, pushing two shells into his shotgun. \nPULLING DEUTSCH \nCharlie looms behind him and \u0096 THWACK \u0096 snaps the shotgun closed. \nBARTON ...I'm sorry. \nWearily: \nCHARLIE Don't be. \nHe rises to his feet and kneels in front of Barton at the foot of the bed. \nThe two men regard each other. \nCharlie grabs two bars of the footboard frame, still staring at Barton. His muscles tighten, though nothing moves. His neck fans with effort. All of his muscles tense.  His face is a reddening grimace. \nWith a shriek of protest, the metal gives. The bar to which Barton is handcuffed had come loose at the top and Barton slides the cuff off it, free. \nCharlie gets to his feet. \nCHARLIE I'm getting off the merry-go-round. \nHe takes his shotgun and walks to the door. \nCHARLIE ...I'll be next door if you need me. \nA thought stops him at the door and he turns to face Barton. Behind him the hallway blazes. \nCHARLIE ...Oh, I dropped in on your folks. And Uncle Dave? \nHe smiles. Barton looks at him dumbly. \nCHARLIE ...Good people. By the way, that package I gave you? I lied. It isn't mine. \nHe leaves. \nBarton rises, picks up Charlie's parcel, and his script. \nTHE HALLWAY \nAs Barton emerges. Flames lick the walls, causing the wallpaper to run with the tack glue sap. Smoke fills the hallway. Barton looks down the hall. \nHIS POV \nCharlie stands in front of the door to his room, his briefcase dangling from one hand, his other hand fumbling in his pocket for his key. \nWith his hat pushed back on his head and his shoulders slumped with fatigue, he could be any drummer returning to any hotel after a long hard day on the road. \nHe opens the door and goes into his room. \nBACK TO BARTON \nHe turns and walks up the hallway, his script in one hand, the parcel in the other. \nA horrible moaning sound \u0096 almost human \u0096 can be heard under the roar of the fire. \nBLACKNESS \nSTUDIO HALLWAY \nWe are tracking laterally across the lobby of an executive building. From offscreen we hear: \nBARTON Fink! Morris or Lillian Fink! Eighty- five Fulton Street! \nFiltered through phone: \nOPERATOR I understand that, sir \u0096 \nBARTON Or Uncle Dave! \nOur track has brought Barton into frame in the foreground, unshaven, unkempt, bellowing into the telephone. In a hallway in the background, a secretary gestures for Barton to hurry up. \nOPERATOR I understand that, sir, but there's still no answer. Shall I check for trouble on the line? \nBarton slams down the phone. \nLIPNIK'S OFFICE \nBarton enters, still clinging on to Charlie's parcel. \nLou Breeze stands in one corner censoriously watching Barton. Lipnik is at the far end of the room, gazing out the window. \nLIPNIK Fink. \nBARTON Mr. Lipnik. \nLIPNIK Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind. \nHe turns to face Barton and we see that he is wearing a smartly pressed uniform with a lot of fruit salad on the chest. \nLIPNIK ...Siddown. \nBarton takes a seat facing Lipnik's desk. \nLIPNIK ...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend. \nBARTON Congratulations. \n", "test1_input": "Barton crosses to the secretary and sits down, rubbing the back of his head. He rolls up the carriage and looks at the page in the typewriter. \nHIS POV \nThe page. \nFADE IN: \nA TENEMENT BUILDING \nOn Manhattan's Lower East Side. Early morning traffic is audible, as is the cry fishmongers. \nBACK TO BARTON \nHe rubs the back of his head, wincing, as he stares at the page. \nHis gaze drifts up. \nHIS POV \nThe bathing beauty. \nBARTON \nLooking at the picture. He presses the heels of his hands against his ears. \nHIS POV \nThe bathing beauty. Faint, but building, is the sound of the surf. \nBARTON \nHead cocked. The surf is mixing into another liquid sound. Barton looks sharply around. \nTHE BATHROOM \nBarton enters. \nThe sink, which Charlie apparently left running when he wet Barton's towel, is overflowing. Water spills onto the tile floor. \nBarton hurriedly shuts off the tap, rolls up one sleeve and reaches into the sink. \nAs his hand emerges, holding something, we hear the unclogged sink gulp water. \nBARTON'S HAND \nHolding a dripping wad of cotton. \nBARTON \nAfter a brief, puzzled look he realizes where the cotton came from \u0096 and convulsively flips it away. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN: \nON THE TITLE PAGE OF A BOOK: \n\"NEBUCHADNEZZAR BY W.P. Mayhew\" \nA hand enters with pen to inscribe: \"To Barton \u0096 \nMay this little entertainment divert you in your sojourn among the Philistines.  \u0096 Bill\" \nThe book is closed and picked up. \nWIDER \nAs-thoomp!-the heavy volume is deposited across the table, in front of Barton, by Mayhew. \nBarton, Mayhew, and Audrey are seated around a picnic table. It is one of a few tables littering the lot of a small stucco open-air hamburger stand. \nIt is peaceful early evening. The last of the sunlight slopes down through palm trees. Barton, Mayhew, and Audrey are the only customers at the stand. \nMayhew's black Ford stands alone at the edge of the lot. \nMayhew leans back in his chair. \nMAYHEW If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak. \nAUDREY That's hamburger grease, Bill. \nMAYHEW Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish on me \u0096 lyin' and deceitful... \nHis eyes still closed, he waves a limp hand gently in the breeze. \nMAYHEW ...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace? \nBARTON Well... actually, no Bill... \nBarton looks nervously at Audrey before continuing. \nBARTON ...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man \u0096 to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it. \n", "test1_true": "He sighs and reaches for a bottle of Wild Turkey. \nMAYHEW ...This'll sometimes help. \nAUDREY That doesn't help anything, Bill. \nBARTON That's true, Bill. I've never found it to help my writing. \nMayhew is becoming testy: \nMAYHEW Your writing? Son, have you ever heard the story of Soloman's mammy- \nAudrey, anticipating, jumps hastily in. She taps the book on the table. \nAUDREY You should read this, Barton. I think it's Bill's finest, or among his finest anyway. \nMayhew looks at her narrowly. \nMAYHEW So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched. \nAUDREY Bill \u0096 \nBARTON Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent \u0096 don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again? \nMAYHEW And what would that be, son? \nBARTON I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about. \nMAYHEW No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'. \nBARTON What's that? \nMAYHEW I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door. \nAUDREY Maybe you better too, Barton. Before you get buried under his manure. \nMayhew chuckles. \nMAYHEW M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything. \nAUDREY Not anything, Bill. Don't test me. \nBARTON You're lucky she puts up with as much as she does. \nMayhew is getting to his feet. \nMAYHEW Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity \u0096 the basest coin there is. \nAUDREY Stop it, Bill! \nHe wanders over to a corner of the lot between two palm trees, still clutching his bottle, his back to Barton and Audrey, and urinates into the grass. \nHe is singing \u0096 loudly \u0096 \"Old Black Joe.\" \nAudrey walks over to him. \nBARTON \nWatching her go. \nHIS POV \nAudrey touches Mayhew's elbow. He looks at her, stops singing, she murmurs something, and he bellows: \nMAYHEW The truth, m'honey, is a tart that does not bear scrutiny. \nShe touches him again, murmuring, and he lashes out at her, knocking her to the ground. \nMAYHEW Breach my levee at your peril! \nBARTON \nHe rises. \nAUDREY \nComing back to Barton. \nMAYHEW \nStumbling off down the dusty road, muttering to himself and waving his bottle of Wild Turkey. \nAUDREY Let him go. \nBARTON That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer. \nHe looks down the road. Mayhew is a small lone figure, weaving in the dust. \nMAYHEW I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise. \nBARTON Are you all right? \nWe hear distant bellowing: \n", "test2_input": "CHARLIE Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face!  This is still home for me \u0096 I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later... \nBarton rises and walks over to his writing table. \nCHARLIE ...And \u0096 mark my words \u0096 by the time I get back you're picture'll be finished. I know it. \nBarton scribbles on a notepad and turns to hand it to Charlie. \nBARTON New York can be pretty cruel to strangers, Charlie. If you need a home-cooked meal you just look up Morris and Lillian Fink.  They live on Fulton Street with my uncle Dave. \nWe hear a tacky, tearing sound. \nBarton looks toward the door. \nCharlie rises and walks over to the stand next to where Barton sits. \nThe two staring men form an odd, motionless tableau \u0096 the slight, bespectacled man seated; the big man standing in a hunch with his hands on his thighs; their heads close together. \nTHEIR POV \nA swath of wallpaper in the entryway has pulled away from the wall. It sags and nods. \nCHARLIE (off) Christ! \nTHE TWO MEN \nFrozen, looking. \nCHARLIE ...Your room does that too? \nBARTON I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper. \nCHARLIE What a dump... \nHe heads for the door and Barton follows. \nCHARLIE ...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you. \nBARTON Well... \nCHARLIE Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York. \nBARTON What do you mean? \nCHARLIE This kind of heat. It's pathetic. \nBARTON Well, I guess you pick your poison. \nCHARLIE So they say. \nBARTON Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye. \nCHARLIE Course not, compadre. You'll see me again. \nBarton closes the door. \nHe goes back to the desk, sits, and stares at the typewriter. After a beat he tips back in his chair and looks up at the ceiling. \nWe hear a loud thump. \nHIS POV \nThe ceiling \u0096 a white, seamless space. \nAs we track in the thumping continues \u0096 slowly, rhythmically, progressively louder \u0096 the effect, it seems, of odd doings upstairs. \nLOOKING DOWN ON BARTON \nFrom a high angle, tipped back in his chair, staring at the ceiling. \nWe track slowly down toward him. The thumping continues, growing louder, sharper. \nHIS POV \nMoving in on the ceiling. We close in on an unblemished area and cease to have any sense of movement. \nWith a blur something huge and dark sweeps across the frame to land with a deafening crash, and an instant later it is gone, having left a huge black \"T\" stamped into the white ceiling. \nWe are pulling back from the white, past the metal prongs of the key-strike area on a typewriter. More letters appear rapid-fire, growing smaller as the pull back continues. The thumpimg becomes the clacking of the typewriter. \nBEN GEISLER \nIs emerging from his office.  As he enters the secretary stops typing, glances down at a slip of paper, and murmurs tonelessly, without looking up: \nSECRETARY Barton Fink. \nGEISLER Yeah. Fink. Come in. \nThe clack of the typewriter resumes as Barton rises. \nGEISLER'S OFFICE \nThe two men enter. \n", "test2_true": "Geisler sits behind his desk. \nGEISLER Wuddya got for me \u0096 what the hell happened to your face? \nBARTON Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite. \nGEISLER Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps \u0096 this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me? \nBARTON Well I... \nGEISLER On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got? \nBARTON Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started\u0096 \nGEISLER Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?! \nBARTON Well not much. \nGeisler leaps to his feet and paces. \nGEISLER What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill! \nBARTON I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob- \nGEISLER Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this! \nBARTON Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew- \nGEISLER Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse! \nBARTON He's a great writer \u0096 \nGEISLER A souse! \nBARTON You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write- \nGEISLER Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week! \nBARTON But... I thought no one cared about this picture. \nGEISLER You thought! Where'd you get THAT from?  You thought! I don't know what the hell you said to Lipnik, but the sonofabitch LIKES you! You understand that, Fink? He LIKES you! He's taken an interest. NEVER make Lipnik like you. NEVER! \nSome puzzlement shows through Barton's weariness. \nBARTON I don't understand- \nGEISLER Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him? \nBARTON I didn't say anything- \nGEISLER Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going \u0096 don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow. \nBARTON I can't write anything by tomorrow. \nGEISLER Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake. \nBARTON Well what do I tell him? \nGeisler rubs a temple, studies Barton for a beat, then picks up a telephone. \nGEISLER Projection... \nAs he waits, Geisler gives Barton a withering stare. It continues throughout the phone conversation. \nGEISLER ... Jerry? Ben Geisler here. Any of the screening rooms free this afternoon?...  Good, book it for me. A writer named Fink is gonna come in and you're gonna show him wrestling pictures... I don't give a shit which ones! WRESTLING pictures!  Wait a minute- isn't Victor Sjoderberg shooting one now?... Show him some of the dailies on that. \nHe slams down the phone. \nGEISLER ...This ought to give you some ideas. \nHe jots an address on a piece of paper and hands it to Barton. \nGEISLER ...Eight-fifteen tomorrow morning at Lipnik's house. Ideas. Broad strokes. Don't cross me, Fink. \nSCREEN \nBlack-and-white footage. A middle-aged man with a clapstick enters and shouts: \nCLAPPER DEVIL ON THE CANVAS, twelve baker take one. \nClap! The clapper withdraws. The angle is on a corner of the ring, where an old corner man stands behind his charge, a huge man in tights who is a little too flabby to be a real athlete. His hair is plastered against his bullet skull and he has a small mustache. \nVOICE Action. \nThe wrestler rises from his stool and heads toward center ring and the camera. He affects a German accent: \nWRESTLER I will destroy him! \nHe passes the camera. \nVOICE Cut. \nFlash frames. \n", "test3_input": "The clapper enters again. \nCLAPPER Twelve baker take two. \nClap! He exits. \nThe wrestler moves toward the camera. \nWRESTLER I will destroy him! \nVOICE Cut. \nThe clapper enters \nCLAPPER Twelve baker take three. \nClap! \nWRESTLER I will destroy him! \nSLOW TRACK IN ON BARTON \nSeated alone in a dark screening room, the shaft of the projection beam flickering over his left shoulder. \nAs we creep in closer: \nWRESTLER (off) I will destroy him!... I will destroy him!... I will destroy him!... I will destroy him!... \nAnother off-microphone, distant voice from the screen: \nVOICE Okay, take five... \nTHE SCREEN \nA jerky pan, interrupted by flash frames. The wrestler is standing in a corner joking with a makeup girl who pats down his face as he smokes a cigarette. \nA cut in the film and another clapstick enters. \nCLAPPER Twelve charlie take one- \nON THE CLAP: \nBACK TO BARTON \nStaring at the screen, dull, wan, and forlorn. \nVOICE (off) Action. \nTHE SCREEN \nThe angle is low \u0096 canvas level. We hold for a brief moment on the empty canvas before two wrestlers crash down into frame. \nThe German is underneath, on his back, pinned by the other man. \nThe referee enters, cropped at the knees, and throws counting fingers down into frame. \nREFEREE One... two... \nWRESTLER AAAAHHHH!! \nThe German bucks and throws his opponent out of frame. \nVOICE Cut. \nCLAPPER Twelve charlie take two. \nCrash. \nREFEREE One... two... \nWRESTLER AAAAHHHH!! \nBARTON \nGlazed. \nWRESTLER (off) AAAAAAHHHHHH!!... AAAAAAHHHHHH!!... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!... \nPAGE IN TYPEWRITER \nThe screaming drops out abruptly at cut. We hear only the sound of heavy footfalls on carpet. \nBelow the opening paragraph, two new words have been added to the typescript: \n\"Orphan?\" \n\"Dame?\" \nThe foot falls continue. \nTHE HOTEL ROOM \nNight. Barton paces frantically back and forth. \n", "test3_true": "HIS POV \nIt is 12:30. \nCLOSE ON THE PHONE \nIt is lifted out of the cradle. \nBARTON Hello, Chet, it's Barton Fink in 605. Can you try a number for me in Hollywood...  Slausen 6-4304. \nWe pull back to frame in Barton as we hear his call ring through.  Barton sweats. \nBARTON Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it- \nAUDREY Hello. \nBARTON Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this \u0096 believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I \u0096 I'm sorry - listen, how are you \u0096 I'm sorry. You doing okay? \nAUDREY ...Who is this? \nBARTON Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink. \nThrough the phone, in the background, we hear Mayhew's drunken bellowing. \nMAYHEW Sons of bitches! Drown 'em all! \nWe hear various objects dropping or being thrown to the floor. \nAUDREY Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time- \nMAYHEW Drown all those rascals... \nBARTON I'm sorry, I just feel like \u0096I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow- \nMAYHEW I said drown 'em all! Who is that? \nThere is more clatter. \nAudrey's voice is hushed, close to the phone: \nAUDREY All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away- \nMAYHEW Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches... \nBARTON If you could, I'd \u0096 \nAUDREY If I can. He gets jealous; he- \nMAYHEW Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM! \nBARTON I need help, Audrey. \nAUDREY I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks \u0096 well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational\u0096 \nMAYHEW Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN \u0096 \nWIDE ON THE ROOM \nLater. It is quiet. We are craning down toward the bed, where Barton lies stretched out, his head buried beneath a pillow as if to blot out the world. \nThe track reveals the wristwatch on Barton's dangled arm: \nTHE HALLWAY \nAt the end of the dimly lit corridor a red light blinks on over the elevator, with a faint bell. \nBACK TO BARTON \nWith two violent and simultaneous motions he whips the pillow off his head and throws out his other wrist to look at his watch. \nThere is a knock at the door. \nBarton swings his feet off the bed. \nTHE DOORWAY \nBarton opens the door to Audrey. \nAUDREY Hello, Barton. \nBARTON Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you. \nThey enter the main room, where Audrey perches on the edge of the bed. \nAUDREY Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right. \nBARTON Yes. Thank you. How's Bill? \nAUDREY Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll sleep for a while now. What is it you have to do, exactly? \nBarton paces. \nBARTON Well I have to come up with \u0096 an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn- \n"}

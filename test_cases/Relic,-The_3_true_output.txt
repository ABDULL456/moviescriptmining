PENDERGAST Mind if I have a look? 
D'Agosta calls to A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER who comes down the staircase carrying lights, a donut stuffed in his mouth. 
D'AGOSTA We need light in here, stat. 
PENDERGAST Where's the head? 
D'Agosta points to a lump the size of a bowling ball that's in the corner. 
D'AGOSTA Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains. 
PENDERGAST Whose footprints? 
D'AGOSTA Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man.  Been tossing his cookies for over an hour.  Not a likely suspect. 
The photographer is finally ready and he floods the dark room with light.  And now everyone (but not us) gets a very clear look at the body. 
THE PHOTOGRAPHER... spits out his donut.  His eyes roll up and he drops in a dead faint.  Just like that.  D'Agosta swallows hard. 
D'AGOSTA Woof. 
Pendergast looks down, utterly impassive. 
PENDERGAST Yes, I'd say we're definitely working on the same case. 
INT. IMAX ROOM - DAY 
An old 19th century theater.  Balconies.  Heavy curtains.  It looks like the theater where Lincoln was shot, with the exception of the most recent addition, an IMAX SCREEN five stories high.  The room is filling with museum employees, all murmuring anxiously.  Margo sits down next to Frock's wheelchair.  Her face is ashen. 
MARGO Dr. Frock, I just saw a man back there who'd been wading in blood. 
As Greg Kawakita sits in the chair next to Margo... 
MARGO (CON'T) For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on? 
KAWAKITA Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal. 
FROCK For heaven's sake, Greg, someone's been killed.  Look, it's Cuthbert. Let's hear what really happened. 
At this everyone falls silent and IAN CUTHBERT steps forward to address the crowd.  He appears drawn and grey. 
CUTHBERT This has been a tragic and upsetting morning.  I have terrible news for us all.  A member of our security force has been found murdered.  The police have just informed me it was Daniel Beauregard. (murmuring fills the room) Quiet.  Please.  With the help of our head of security, Mr. Ippolito... the museum has been secured. 
IPPOLITO... rises in the back and nods to the crowd... He's an imperious looking, pompous man with shifty eyes.  Right now he's defensive. Overnight, his job is on the line... 
CUTHBERT The police are satisfied we're in no danger, that we're all perfectly safe.  We've been asked to remain in the Gem Room and be available for questioning for the rest of the day. Obviously, we will all do everything we can to cooperate.  Are there any questions? 
Ippolito raises a hand. 
IPPOLITO The party for the opening of the Superstition Exhibit... I imagine in the light of what's happened it will be pushed back. 
CUTHBERT No action has been taken yet.  The opening of the exhibit is crucial to the financial health of this museum. So for now, we expect that the Superstition Exhibit will open on schedule, tomorrow night. 
Ippolito registers surprise.  The audience buzzes again. 
INT. GEM ROOM - DAY 
Margo, Dr. Frock and Greg Kawakita enter.  The room is full of spectacular displays of gemstones of every type.  Greg drapes himself over a grey sofa.  Margo leans on a giant geode. 
MARGO That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit. 
FROCK Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems. 
KAWAKITA With all this bad publicity, it's no wonder he looks like that. 
They glance over and see Cuthbert in the corner.  He appears ill, is compulsively fingering his watch chain from which hangs a RABBIT'S FOOT.  Frock goes over to speak to him, followed by Margo and Greg. 
FROCK Ian.  Are you okay? 
CUTHBERT (shakes his head) Beauregard.  I can't believe it.  I may have been the last one to see him alive.  He was with me just yesterday, when I got out the statue of Mbwun. 
MARGO (taken aback) Mbwun. 
KAWAKITA (sensing more gossip) What's that? 
Margo frowns, suddenly uneasy.  She and Dr. Frock exchange a look.

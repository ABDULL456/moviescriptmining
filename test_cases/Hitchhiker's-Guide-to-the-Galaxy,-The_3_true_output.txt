FORD Yeah.    I kinda like this. 
She take the gun from him. 
TRILLIAN A gun that makes people suddenly see things from your point of view. Useful tool for the deranged evangelist trying to convert the masses, eh? 
She starts walking. 
TRILLIAN (CONT'D) We should get back. Arthur's waiting. 
ZAPHOD Who cares? 
TRILLIAN (spinning on him; pointed) I do -- especially since we're both somewhat of an endangered species now.

00   CONTINUED:                                                       100 ZAPHOD Why so edgy? 
She can't believe he's asking this.     She aims the gun, CLICK! 
ZAPHOD (CONT'D) Of course you're edgy, your planet's been blown up and you've been tooling around the Galaxy with the guy who signed the order 
CLICK.   She shoots him again. 
ZAPHOD (CONT'D) You actually wanted to know the Question because you always thought there was more to life, and now you're crushed because you find out there really isn't. 
She's getting angrier and more hurt.     CLICK. 
ZAPHOD (CONT'D) You've got no home, no family, no one to be with -- and you're stuck with me, another in a long line of men who doesn't appreciate you because he's too busy appreciating himself. 
Hearing this puts a lump in her throat, causes her eyes to well with tears. She lowers the gun. 
Zaphod shakes his head -- the effect wearing off.       But he realizes what he said and doesn't like it. 
ZAPHOD (CONT'D) Give me that thing. 
He grabs the gun, points it at her. 
TRILLIAN Won't affect me.   I'm already a woman. 
Before he can react, A BRIGHT LIGHT SHINES BEHIND THEM. They turn, shielding their eyes. 
ZAPHOD Uh oh -- oh. It's okay, it's only a couple of... 
FLASH! KEEEOOOW!    They are engulfed in WHITE LIGHT. 
BACK TO: 
101      EXT. DEEP SPACE (FACTORY FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS                     101 
The transport cart continues toward the 3rd planet. 
SLARTIBARTFAST Here we are, then. Look familiar? 
Arthur turns and looks. There before him is... 
HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 
O1a   EARTH -- Arthur is thunderstruck...then confused.           101a 
ARTHUR So -- it wasn't destroyed? 
SLARTIBARTFAST Actually, it was. This is a back-up. Earth Mark II. 
ARTHUR So you're saying you ... made the Earth? 
SLARTIBARTFAST Well, not me alone. It was a group effort. I did my part, though. Ever heard of a place, I think it's called Norway? 
101b      Arthur nods. The cart pushes through the clouds, towards    101b Ayers Rock. A GUY ON A LADDER is painting it it's familiar red color. Some of it is still primer grey. 
SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D) That was one of mine. Won an award you know. Lovely crinkly edges. I was sorry to hear about it being blown up. Shocking cock up. The mice were furious. 
ARTHUR Mice?    Who cares about bloody mice? 
SLARTIBARTFAST Are you a fan of plate tectonics? 
Arthur looks up.   Slartibartfast points down. 
101c      ANOTHER MAN pushes a button causing mountains to spring     101c up noisily. 
SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D) Voila!   Himalayas. Good, eh? 
Arthur is working very hard to process all this. 
101d      JUMP CUT. They move through a forest where a man presses    101d a lever making several MUSHROOMS pop up on the ground. 
SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D) Earthman, you must realize that the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice. It was destroyed shortly before the completion of the purpose for which it was built. Ten minutes later, we would have been free and clear. But we gave them our standard ten million year warranty and they have come here to retrieve this back-up copy. And they've brought you with them. 
The transport cart flies out of forest toward the ocean.

SARAH I've got a summer internship at an ad agency. 
KELLY Fancy. 
SARAH It's all right, I guess. 
KELLY No, it's great. 
Kelly moves around to her other side, closer. 
KELLY Hey - 
Sarah moves away. Once bitten twice shy and all that. 
SARAH When are you going to get a real job? 
KELLY I don't know. Probably when I figure out something better to do. 
SARAH You can't be a stock boy your whole life. 
Sarah walks to the front of the store. Kelly walks with her. 
KELLY Yeah I can. I mean, I probably won't, but I could. 
Sarah turns to him at the checkout aisle. 
SARAH Well, it was good seeing you. 
KELLY Um. 
SARAH What? 
KELLY Remember that presentation I told you never to ask me about again? 
INT. OLD SOLDIERS' HOME - DAY 
Kelly stands in the front of the room, pointing to a battle plan with large arrows drawn on it. 
Charlie, Mr. Norman, Principal Holmstead, Eve and Sarah sit among other OLD SOLDIERS. 
KELLY Lee arrayed his defenses over here. Only this time, Grant was ready for him. 
Kelly keeps talking. Many of the OLD SOLDIERS sleep. 
OLD SOLDIER 1 (to old soldier 2) This is boring. 
OLD SOLDIER 2 Yeah. Let's see that slide of the wife again. 
DOMINO TABLE 
Sarah, Kelly, and Eve play dominos with Charlie and Mr. Norman. 
MR. NORMAN (to Charlie) Remarkable, remarkable. And they never knew? 
CHARLIE The real kicker was moving those cutouts of tanks around. The thought we had a whole regiment over there, but it was just a couple of us and those Hollywood props. 
EVE That's amazing. Art playing a part in war. 
CHARLIE You're damned right. We practically won the thing right there. (eyeing Sarah and Eve with approval) Now this is more like it. Anyone care to place a wager on the table? 
Kelly tries to gesture to Sarah "no." 
SARAH If you think it would be more fun. 
MR. NORMAN I can't imagine having more fun that I am now. 
Mr. Norman smiles at the group. 
CHARLIE You're never been to a French whorehouse, I take it. 
EVE I have. 
MR. NORMAN Oh, my. 
EXT. OLD SOLDIERS' HOME - DAY 
Eve waits while Kelly and Sarah walk out to Sarah's car. 
Kelly helps Sarah into it and closes the door for her. 
KELLY I still don't understand how you did that. 
SARAH I spent my summers with my grandma in the Catskills. She didn't give me any spending money. (shrugs) So I played the bones for ice cream. 
She pulls away. He watches her go. 
KELLY Hot damn. 
FADE OUT:

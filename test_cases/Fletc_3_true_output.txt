FLETCH Sierra del fuego. 
The waiter bows, leaves, shuts the door. Mrs. Stanwyk scampers back in, gazes at the cart as Fletch takes a bottle of Dom Perignon and pops the cork. 
MRS. STANWYK All this goes on Underhill's bill? 
FLETCH (offering her a glass) I saved his life during the war. 
MRS. STANWYK You were in the war? 
FLETCH No. He was. I got him out. 
She laughs and sighs, knowing she's getting into something she probaly shouldn't. 
MRS. STANWYK I can't believe I'm doing this. Well, lets eat. 
She tucks a napkin in her towel like a bib and sits at the table. 
158 EXT. RAQUET CLUB - DAY 
The Underhills have just been handed the bill run up by Fletch. 
MR. UNDERHILL Four hundred bucks for lunch??? 
WAITER Your guest, sir. 
MR. UNDERHILL We have no guest here today. (reading the bill) Two bottles of Dom Perignon, hundred bucks a pop. Jesus H. Christ! Where is he? 
WAITER I believe he's with Mrs. Stanwyk. 
MRS. UNDERHILL Gail Stanwyk. Tom, if he's with Gail Stanwyk --- 
MR. UNDERHILL I don't care who he's with! This is criminal. 
MRS. UNDERHILL Tom.... 
MR. UNDERHILL She's where, cabana one? 
WAITER Yes sir. 
Mr Underhill stalks off. 
159 INT. CABANA - DAY 
Fletch and Mrs. Stanwyk are having lunch. Fletch sings while he opens the champagne. She is looking at his back which is turned to her. 
FLETCH 'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes....' 
MRS. STANWYK It's amazing. 
FLETCH 'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching....' 
MRS. STANWYK Your bone structure, shoulders, neck.... 
FLETCH 'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.' 
MRS. STANWYK Just like Alan. It's freaky. 
FLETCH Can I ask you a question? 
MRS. STANWYK Depends on the question. 
FLETCH Are you still in love with Alan? 
MRS. STANWYK No. (quickly) I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else. 
FLETCH Why'd you let me in? 
MRS. STANWYK Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry. 
FLETCH Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan? 
MRS. STANWYK Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom. 
FLETCH Good point. 
MRS. STANWYK Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there. 
FLETCH What about his parents?

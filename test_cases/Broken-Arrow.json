{"train": "HALE AND DEAKINS Enter and walk under the plane, nodding to the ground crew. Hale and Deakins are royalty. Deakins and Hale climb up the airplane's Crew Entry steps and disappear. \nINT. COCKPIT \nHale and Deakins climb into a very strange cockpit. There are two pilots' seats in this plane, with duplicate controls. \nBut instead of the usual dials and gauges on the control panels, there are FOUR COMPUTER SCREENS in front of each pilot. Hale gets into the left seat; Deakins the right. They review information on their screens, flip switches. \nINTERCUT WITH BOMBS Being loaded into the bomb bays. When they've been clamped into place in the rotary bomb racks... \nDEAKINS (into helmet mike) Ready for rollout. \nINT./EXT. HANGAR \nAlarm horns sound, wheels roll on track and the huge hangar doors open revealing... \nTHE GHOST An enormous black flying wing. \nINT. COCKPIT \nDeakins looks at maps on his computer screens. Hale looks over, sees the map of Utah. \nHALE You know, these exercises are fantastic. I mean, when that day comes and we finally go to war against Utah, we are really going to kick ass. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK, UTAH - NIGHT \nBright moonlight shows a campfire burning at the edge of an escarpment, the Colorado River a thousand feet below. Near the campfire is an Army surplus tent. Next to it, an easel holds a painting in progress. \nA PARK RANGER TRUCK Drives up, stops. The driver's door open, and out gets... \nA RANGER We don't see his face in the dark. He switches on a flashlight, walks over and taps on the tent. \nRANGER Park Ranger. I'd like to talk to somebody about this fire. \nWe hear a man and a woman -- JIM and WANDA, 60s -- wake up. \nJIM (O.S.) Wha--? Oh, hell. \nWANDA (O.S.) I'll talk to him, Jim. \nJIM (O.S.) Wanda, you stay put. Jim comes out of the tent, the ranger's light in his face. \nJIM I know -- no wood fires in the Park. It's just -- Wanda's got a cold and I wanted her to stay warm. \nRANGER Sir, you see any other hikers, campers anywhere around here? \nJIM Not this time of year. What's the fine for something like this? \nRANGER Your life. Jim grins. But the ranger pulls out a pistol and shoots Jim, who falls into the fire. He then puts three shots through the wall of the tent. Nothing moves. The Ranger -- call him BAKER -- pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on. \nBAKER Done. \nHEADLIGHTS Come on and two Humvees roll in and four men get out. Three of them -- JOHNSON, a tech-whiz; LETT, gangly, grim, and NOVACEK, a wiry guy in a baseball cap -- start setting up what looks to be a high-tech missile launcher. The fourth man is... \nMR. PRITCHETT A neatly groomed man, 40s, with a perpetually sour attitude. He looks like -- and is -- a lawyer. \nPRITCHETT (to Baker, re: Jim in \nFIRE) Jesus. Do you think maybe you could get him out of the fire? Unless you like that smell. \nEXT. THE NIGHT SKY \nThe Ghost flies overhead, roaring. \nINT. COCKPIT \nINT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER \nCU RADAR SCREEN The Ghost's blip disappears. \nWILKINS Lost 'em on active! Who's still got 'em? \nIR CREWMAN Got their heat signature, sir. (points to computer \nSCREEN) Their engines may be cold, but the air is colder. \nCU COMPUTER SCREEN Half of the screen shows a waveform, like a voiceprint. The other half shows a triangle moving across a map of Colorado. \nINT. COCKPIT \nDeakins studies the maps on the computer screens. \nDEAKINS Descend to 400 feet AGL. River valley approach. \nHALE Airspeed lock at point-seven Mach. Blue line descent on throttle to 400 feet AGL. Hale pulls back on the throttle. The plane descends. \nHALE Time to limbo down. How low can we go. \nEXT. NIGHT SKY \nThe Ghost drops away from us, a stark black cut-out against the moonlit Colorado landscape. The Colorado River is a winding silver ribbon five miles below. \nEXT. CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK, UTAH - NIGHT \nA PARK RANGER TRUCK Driving along the blacktop. The driver is not Baker. It's... \nTERRY CARMICHAEL Pretty, late 20s. Her radio squawks. \nCLYDE (V.0.) Terry? You been through the Needles entrance tonight? \nTERRY (grabs mike, answers) No. Why? \nCLYDE (V.0.) Mrs. Parker called -- \nTERRY Oh, God. What is it this time? UFO abduction? Ritual human sacrifice? \nCLYDE (V.0.) She said she saw a bunch of trucks going through the Needles entrance an hour ago and thought they looked suspicious. \nTERRY Yes, well, this is a woman who chopped off one of her own fingers because it'd \"turned on her.\" \nCLYDE (V.0.) Thing is, she said one of the trucks was ours, and you're the only one out. \nTERRY (arches eyebrow) She was probably hallucinating, but I'll check it out. \nEXT. COLORADO RIVER VALLEY - THIRTY MILES UP RIVER \nWe feel the Ghost before we hear it. It rushes over, close to the river, below the ridgelines on either side of the valley. \nINT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER \nThe triangle representing the Ghost disappears from a computer screen. \nIR CREWMAN Lost 'em. \nWILKINS Stay on it. They're gonna have to come up for air sooner or later. \nINT. COCKPIT \nDeakins reads his computer screens. \nDEAKINS We're under the radar. Proceed to primary target. Hale hits a button, lets go of the stick -- they're on autopilot. It's a moment of peace. Hale looks out. \nHALE I tell people I became a pilot because I wanted to fly cool planes. It's also for this. When we're up here, I feel... closer ... I don't know. \nEXT. THE GHOST \nHeads into the beacon light. \nINT. COCKPIT \nHale and Deakins look at each other as the plane enters the light and the light, in SLOW MOTION, washes across their faces. \nDEAKINS Suddenly lets go of Hale's hand, then hits Hale hard under the chin with the fire extinguisher. \nHALE His head snaps back as Deakins pulls. \nHALE'S EJECTION SEAT HANDLE Pop, hiss like a huge vacuum-sealed can is being opened. \nEXT. ABOVE GHOST \nThe ejection hatch blows and is ripped away by the wind. \nHALE'S POV As he rockets up out of the cockpit. \nHALE When the chute opens, he almost spills out because of the severed shoulder harness. He grabs the straps, holds on. \nEXT. ON THE GROUND \nTerry, on the radio with Clyde. \nTERRY Somebody ejected! \nINT. COCKPIT \nDebris -- coffee cups, flight bags, anything not nailed down -- is whipping around the inside of the cabin. Deakins reaches through the maelstrom, then reaches to the ARMAMENT BUTTONS and punches them. \nINT. BOMB BAYS \nThe the clamps snap back and the two B-83s drop toward the earth. \nINT. COCKPIT \nDeakins looks around, then gets an idea. He hits the LANDING mission mode button and the cockpit lights up. \nINT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER \nThe Ghost starts popping up on everyone's screens. There's a chorus of \"I got em!\" and \"They're ba-a-a-ck!\" Wilkins looks at a screen, puzzled. \nWILKINS They're not due for another halfhour. \nINT. GHOST COCKPIT \nDeakins yells into his helmet mike as he gets ready to eject. \nDEAKINS (into helmet mike) This is Deakins! Hale lost it! I have to punch out! Deakins pulls his second handle. BLAM! WHOOSH! He's gone. He hear and feel the plane dropping, screaming toward the earth. \nINT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER \nCU RADAR SCREEN The Ghost's blip suddenly disappears from the screen. A chorus of \"What the hell?\" and \"Jesus.\" \nWILKINS That's not good. \nEXT. MCMURRAN RUNWAY \nAlarm horns blare. FIVE MEN are running to a waiting Blackhawk helicopter. Waving the men on is Wilkins. The last man up is... \nLIEUTENANT COLONEL SAM RHODES 40s, short grey hair: he could snap your neck with a look. Wilkins pats Rhodes on the shoulder and Rhodes jumps into... \nTHE HELICOPTER And it lifts up and flies off. \nEXT. CANYONLANDS \nWilkins talks to Rhodes over the radio. \nWILKINS Watch your needles! \nEXT. GHOST CRASH SITE \nRhodes walks up to his men who are in the process of opening the bomb bay doors manually. The doors are open a foot. Rhodes signals his men to stop. Rhodes steps up, shines a light into the bomb bays. \nINSIDE BOMB BAYS Rhodes' light plays over the bomb racks -- empty. \nRHODES (into headset mike) Colonel? (takes breath) We've got ourselves a Broken Arrow. \nINT.PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM \nStunned silence. They've just gotten the news. Baird doesn't know what it means. \nBAIRD Broken Arrow? \nCHAIRMAN That's what we call it when we lose a nuclear weapon. \nBAIRD Oh, Jesus. (thinks, shakes head) I don't know what's scarier -- losing nuclear weapons or the fact that it happens so often that you people have a term for it. \nINT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER \nWilkins is on the radio with Rhodes. \nWILKINS Find the nukes, Sam. But be careful. I know they say those eggs can't be cracked, but if your geigers pick up more rads than you'd get off a toaster, I want you out of there. Wilkins to the CORPORAL. \nWILKINS Get the teams in. I want Colonel Rhodes and his men backed up. \nINT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM \nCU COMPUTER SCREEN Various views of a B-83 nuclear weapon. Creeley is briefing Baird on the nukes. \nBAIRD They dropped from a plane but they didn't go off...? \nCREELEY They have to be armed to detonate. \nBAIRD Then they're destroyed? \nCREELEY (shakes head) They're designed to survive crashes intact. They can lie in a pool of burning jet fuel for five hours without any problem. \nBAIRD How did this happen? \nCREELEY In his last transmission, Colonel Deakins said Major Hale lost control. He probably hit weapons release by accident. Believe me, when a plane's auguring in, you start pushing every button you can. Baird stands, looks at a picture of a Ghost shakes his head. \nBAIRD Hell, we should take the cost of the plane out of major Hale's salary. Although I guess at two billion dollars a pop, that could take a while. \nEXT. CANYONLANDS - DAWN \nHale is still unconscious, lying beside his parachute. There's the crunch of footsteps and a FIGURE looms over Hale. The figure reaches down to touch Hale's shoulder and... \nHALE Spins, grabs the shirt of the figure and cocks his arm about to punch. He hesitates when he sees it's... \nTERRY She seizes Hale's hesitation and punches him hard. \nHALE AND TERRY Hale is stunned. Terry starts to get up, reaching for her gun. Hale strikes out with a leg, getting Terry in the gut, sending her back. She hits the ground, still struggling for her gun. Hale gets up, runs, sprinting off over the rocky terrain. \nHIS POV Jarring, racing over rock and then... \nHALE Pulls up fast, almost not fast enough. \nHALE'S POV He's stopped right at the edge of a fifty foot drop. \nTERRY (O.S.) That would be the wrong way. \nTERRY Is walking slowly, calmy, up behind Hale, pistol out. \nHALE (shakes head) Deakins'll be monitoring any radio transmissions out of here. (off her look) That's what I'd do. \nTERRY Who is this guy? \nHALE (a flash of the horrible betrayal he \nFEELS) Someone I would've trusted with my life. \n(BEAT) You've gotta get to a phone. \nTERRY Me? What are you going to do? (no answer, she \nREALIZES) Wait. You're gonna go after this guy? Isn't he going to have a lot guns and shit? I don't want to sound insulting or anything, but ... you're just a pilot. \nHALE I don't have any choice. The nukes are my responsibility. Besides... (pulls something from \nPOCKET) I do have one thing going for me. \nTERRY What's that? Hale sticks... \nA TWENTY DOLLAR BILL Under a rock. \nHALE The last thing in the world he expects is for me to come after him. Hale walks off into the light of the rising sun. Terry looks at the $20 bill. \nEXT. CREVICE SITE \nThe helicopter is parked at the edge of a deep crevice. \nDOWN IN THE CREVICE Rhodes comes down the last few feet of rope to the bottom of the crevice. Kelly, Thomas and Reed are waiting, shining lights on a B-83 lying in the dirt, all in one piece. \nRHODES (into mike) We've got one intact. (to his men) Let's go find the other one. Rhodes starts off along the bottom of the crevice. \nEXT. TOP OF THE CREVICE - BY THE HELICOPTER \nMcKellar is sitting in the pilot's seat, eating a candy bar. He turns at the unexpected sound of a truck-driving up. \nA HUMVEE climbs up the slope toward the helicopter. \nMCKELLAR Grabs his rifle, hops out of the helicopter. \nNOVACEK AND LETT Are in the Humvee. Novacek sticks his head out. \nNOVACEK Hey, you guys need any help? \nMCKELLAR It's an Air Force training exercise, sir. I'm going to have to ask you to leave. \nNOVACEK Hey, no problem. We just -- \nLETT Whips out a silenced rifle and shoots. \nMCKELLAR Barely has time to raise his rifle before he's hit. He drops. \nANOTHER HUMVEE Drives up fast. \nBAKER, JOHNSON AND PRITCHETT Get out. Johnson wears radio headgear. Pritchett is furious. \nNOVACEK Picks up McKellar's half-eaten candy bar, takes a bite. \nBAKER (to Novacek) Any sign of Deakins? Novacek, mouth full, shakes his head. \nPRITCHETT He better be dead. \nDEAKINS (O.S.) Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Pritchett. They all look over to see... \nDEAKINS Walk out of the shadows, smoking a cigarette. While soldierly with his men, Deakins is courteous and polite with Pritchett. \nPRITCHETT You said nothing would go wrong! \nEXT. ATOP THE CREVICE \nLett pitches back, dead. \nPRITCHETT AND DEAKINS Pritchett looks at Deakins -- another part of the plan? Deakins is unperturbed. He's holding an overnight bag. He unzips it. \nEXT. BOTTOM OF THE CREVICE \nRhodes whispers to Kelly. \nRHODES We'll open up the access panels, put in a couple grenades. The nukes won't go nuclear, but they will go dirty. I won't lie and say we'll be all right. We won't. But if we're gonna go, might as well take those bastards with us. Rhodes scrambles off. \nKELLY Just one thing, sir. \nRHODES \n(TURNS) What? \nKELLY This. Kelly opens fire with his rifle. Rhodes is thrown back, dead. Kelly yells up top. \nKELLY Done! Kelly grabs the rope, climbs fast. \nEXT. ATOP THE CREVICE \nMr. Pritchett looks at Deakins, surprised. Deakins -- putting on new clothes -- just grins. Deakins takes... \nTHE TWENTY DOLLAR BILL From his flightsuit and puts it into his shirt pocket. \nKELLY Climbs into view. \nINT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER \nKelly's voice comes in over the speaker. \nKELLY (V.0.) \n(TERRIFIED) Colonel Wilkins? You there? \nWILKINS Who is this? \nKELLY (V.0.) It's Lieutenant Kelly, sir. \nWILKINS What happened, Kelly? \nEXT. ATOP CREVICE \nKelly talks over the helicopter's radio mike. Deakins is behind him, shaving with an electric shaver. \nKELLY Colonel Rhodes is dead, sir! They're all dead! \nWILKINS (V. 0.) What happened? Deakins puts the shaver to the radio mike. There's a wash of 40 static. Deakins pulls the shaver away, nods to Kelly. \nKELLY It's the nuke, sir! It's open! Wide open! Oh, God, what am I going to do?! Deakins puts the shaver to the mike again -- more static. He reaches into the helicopter and flips off the COM LINK switch, then backs away, shaving. He nods to Novacek, who fires up the helicopter. \nINT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER \nWilkins slumps in his chair. \nWILKINS Call back the teams and get me the Room. We're gonna need NEST in here. \nEXT. CREVICE SITE \nNovacek lifts off in the helicopter and flies away. Deakins turns to Kelly and applauds his performance. \nDEAKINS Brought a tear to my eye. \nKELLY I'd just like to thank the members of the Academy. \nINT. NEST HELICOPTER \nSIX very serious-looking SOLDIERS are in black radiation suits, listening to COLONEL HUNT, 45, over headsets. \nHUNT Listen up, sportsfans. Word is, this particular broken arrow has broken open. Our ETA Utah is ninety-six minutes. I want everyone to take that time to triple-check the seams and seals on their E-suits. Let's go! \nINT. MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM \nGiles looks at Wilkins. \nGILES You think I'm nuts. You don't think NEST or the satellite will find anything weird. \nWILKINS That's right. \n(BEAT) But it wouldn't hurt to get some gunships fueled just in case. Wilkins reaches for a phone. Giles smiles. \nEXT. HELICOPTER EXPLOSION SITE \nThe helicopter wreck burns. Hale looks over the terrain. \nHALE How do they get out of here? \nTERRY Get out? I don't think that helicopter's going anywhere. \nHALE Deak'd have a back-up. He'd be prepared. \nTERRY If they've got trucks they could take the four-wheel-drive trail we were on. \nHALE He wouldn't want to go towards town. \nTERRY He could go to the river. Hale looks at Terry -- that's exactly what Deakins would do. \nEXT. 4WD TRAIL \nThe two Humvees roll along the narrow, twisting trail. \nIN THE SECOND HUMVEE Kelly drives, Deakins beside him, Johnson and Pritchett in back. \nDEAKINS You a fan of boxing, Mr. Pritchett? \nPRITCHETT I think it's barbaric. \nDEAKINS Me, too! I love it! Two men trying to do as much damage to the other as he can. As basic as you can get, don't you think? \nPRITCHETT I think it should be banned. \nDEAKINS So do I! God, wouldn't that make it more exciting? Having to go into dark alleys and basements to see a fight? I bet we see eye-to- eye on a lot of things, Mr. Pritchett. Deakins grins; Mr. Pritchett steams. \nEXT. CANYONLANDS \nHale and Terry stand on an outcropping overlooking the 4WD trail. \nTHEIR POV The two Humvees make their way along the trail. \nHALE See the one in front? It just has a driver? They wanted to keep the weight down. It has the nukes. Hale takes Terry's gun from her. \nTERRY You gonna shoot out the tires? \nHALE Humvees can reseal and inflate with the flick of a switch. That's why Deak chose 'em. Terry looks at Hale -- then what is he going to do? \nHALE I'm gonna steal it. (checks gun) You get to a phone and call McMurran. \nTERRY The nearest phone is a two-hour walk. \nHALE Then you better start walking. \nTERRY Look, I know my way around here. You're gonna need me. \nA FLARE Out of the tool kit. \nIN THE SECOND HUMVEE \nKELLY Maybe he'll set off a nuke. That'd show us. \nBETWEEN THE HUMVEES Hale tosses the jerry can of gasoline out the back of the Humvee. \nTHE JERRY CAN OF GASOLINE Flies through the air. There's a burning flare taped to the side of the plastic can. \nECU TIP OF FLARE As the plastic of the can bubbles and melts and... \nIN THE SECOND HUMVEE \nDEAKINS Stop! But it's too late and... \nTHE JERRY CAN Explodes. \nTHE SECOND HUMVEE Skids to a stop, showered with burning gasoline. Deakins and his men bail out. Kelly, Johnson and Pritchett run for cover. \nDEAKINS Coolly grabs a fire extinguisher and starts spraying. \nIN HALE AND TERRYS HUMVEE Hale climbs up into the front seat. Terry looks at him, genuinely impressed. \nHALE We need somewhere to hide. \nTERRY \n(THINKS) I know a place. \nEXT. 4WD TRAIL \nDeakins keeps spraying the burning Humvee with foam. \nEXT. MINE ENTRANCE \nTerry and Hale have taken the Humvee to the parking area in front of an abandoned mine. The winch on the Humvee strains. The cable is attached to the handles on the padlocked metal doors. The doors are slowly pulling out, groaning. \nTERRY It was a copper mine, barely squeaking along for years. They shut it-down a few months ago when they hit an underground river. The hinges on the metal doors buckle and snap and the doors rip loose. Hale shuts down the winch, unhooks it from the doors. He motions for Terry to drive it in. \nINT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE \nTerry drives the Humvee into the mineshaft entrance. Hale uses a flashlight to look around. He finds a switch a flips it. A gas generator comes to life. Another click and lights come on. Now they can see the rest of the entry area, including a wire- mesh-enclosed elevator. As Terry looks around, Hale grabs the Humvee radio, tries to tune in other frequencies, gives up. \nHALE They hardwired in their frequency. We can't call out. \nTERRY What are we gonna do? Hale goes to the back of the Humvee, pulls down the tailgate. \nHALE I'm gonna take away Deakins' reason for being here. Hale grabs a screwdriver from the tool kit and pries open a panel on the side of one of the B-83s. \nINSIDE PANEL There's an LCD DISPLAY, a NUMERIC KEYPAD and a CLOCK showing the current time. The keys are oversized and brightly colored. \nTERRY Fisher-Price makes nuclear weapons? \nHALE They're designed to be used by guys wearing gloves in Alaska. He reaches in, hits a key and the LCD display lights up. \nHALE These nukes have security codes. If you enter the wrong code three times, the nuke goes dead -- all the circuitry shorts out and shuts down. Kind of like the security systems with car radios. \nTERRY And people say the public doesn't benefit from defense spending. \nHALE \n(GRINS) Hand me the radio. Terry goes for the radio mike. Hale sees something. \nA PLASTIC NAME TAG Sticking out from under one of the nukes. \nHALE Pulls it out, looks at it. \nHALE He's got a scanner. He'd find them. \nTERRY You're talking about setting off a nuclear weapon! \nHALE They set them off underground in Nevada all through the fifties and sixties. There's no risk. \nTERRY Tell it to the two-headed cows. Hale grabs the straps around one of the nukes, pulls. He can barely move the thing. He turns to Terry. \nTERRY No! I am not helping you set off a nuclear weapon. \nHALE We won't be down there when it goes off. This isn't a suicide mission. \nTERRY No! \nHALE \n(IMPATIENT) All right. Fine. Though I think you should know, before I ejected, I heard Deakins say the nukes were going to be used to wipe out the last few remaining handicapped gay whales. Terry looks at him -- you asshole. Hale looks at her, very serious. \nHALE I need your help. Terry thinks, shakes her head, steps up and grabs the nuke. \nEXT. 4WD TRAIL \nThe Humvee takes the turn-off to the mine entrance. \nINT. MINESHAFT ELEVATOR - DESCENDING \nHale and Terry are going down with the nukes. \nHALE When we get to the bottom we'll have to get away from this shaft. It'll limit the amount of radiation released into-the atmosphere. \nEXT. MINE ENTRANCE \nDeakins's Humvee comes into the clearing. The Humvee stops and Deakins and Kelly jump out, followed by Pritchett and Johnson. \nEXT. MINE - BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT \nThe elevator comes down. Hale slides open the gate. He and Terry drag the nukes out. \nTERRY We'll each drag one down a tunnel? \nHALE No. I'm only going to set off one. We'll leave the other one here. It'll be buried under a billion tons of rock. They are startled when the elevator starts going up behind them \nHALE We better hurry. (nods down tunnel) Let's try down there. \nThey start hauling the nuke down the tunnel. \nINT. MINE ENTRANCE \nDeakins, Pritchett, Kelly and Johnson wait by the elevator. \nPRITCHETT I can't wait to see how this fits into your plan. Deakins' charm peels away for an instant and he fixes Pritchett with a stare. Pritchett shrinks back. \nINT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM \nBaird, the Chairman and the others are watching large TV monitors. Creeley walks them through what they're looking at. \nON THE MONITORS A wide-view, bird's-eye, thermal image of rocky terrain. \nCREELEY This is the KH-12 satellite's infrared view of the area. An exposed nuclear core would be relatively hot -- it'd show as a circle of bright white. As you can see, there's nothing. The only heat signatures we found were these. The image changes. There are four blotches, glowing a dull red. \nBAIRD What's --? \nCREELEY We think it's Colonel Rhodes and his men. Their bodies. A look between Baird and the Chairman. The Chairman reaches for a phone. \nINT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER \nWilkins is on the phone. Giles looks at him. \nHALE AND TERRY Reaches up to grab the big rock, but Johnson sends a spray of bullets in. Terry grabs Hale. \nTERRY Come on! \nHALE The sock -- More bullets. Terry pulls Hale. They run down a side passage. Hale and Terry fire back at Johnson as they run out of sight. \nJOHNSON Shoots after them, then runs up to the weapon. He reaches for the rock, stops -- maybe that'll set it off. \nTHE SOCK The last sand pours out; the sock is sucked through the eye-bolt. \nTHE ROCK Drops fast toward the nuke. \nA HAND Grabs it, stopping it just in time. The hand belongs to... \nDEAKINS He looks at Johnson in disgust, exhales, and tosses the rock. He pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on, talks into it. \nDEAKINS We're at the end of tunnel three. (clicks off; to \nJOHNSON) You two get this one set. I'll take the other one up. \nHALE AND TERRY Running along a tunnel. \nTERRY What do we do? \nHALE Beat 'em back to the elevator. Stop 'em from getting out. Terry nods. They hurry off around a corner and are met by... \nA FLURRY OF BULLETS Fired by... \nDEAKINS With his Uzi. \nHALE AND TERRY Run back down the side tunnel, bullets winging off the rock all around them, shooting back. Hale starts shooting out the lights, plunging the tunnel into darkness. \nDEAKINS Slows down. \nDEAKINS The bit with the sock was good. I like it. Still, I'm gonna use the the Field Expedient Tactical Timer. It's a little more precise. \n(BEAT) See, Hale -- you aren't the only one who's thought of setting off a nuke in this mine. \nBY THE NUKE Kelly is there with Johnson. Kelly flips on a lamp on a headstrap, giving him better light as he opens up the metal briefcase he's been carrying. \nINSIDE THE BRIEFCASE An elaborate electronic timer. \nIN THE TUNNELS Deakins pulls out a fresh clip. \nDEAKINS I need a demonstration. Otherwise, some swinging dick in Washington is going to say I don't have the balls or the ability to set off a nuclear weapon. I'm gonna show these puppies I'm ready, willing and able. Hell, I'm eager. Deakins jams in his clip, walks into the dark part of the tunnel. \nHALE AND TERRY In the dark, waiting to ambush Deakins and then... \nDEAKINS Opens fire -- but not at Hale and Terry -- at the cable along the ceiling connecting the lights. The cable snaps and electrical sparks shoot out, flooding the tunnel with light, showing... \nHALE AND TERRY Suddenly exposed to Deakins' fire. The bullets whiz in. \nDEAKINS The muzzle flashes from his Uzi give away his position and Hale and Terry's bullets scream in at him. He backs around a corner. \nHALE AND TERRY Take cover. It's a stand-off. \nDEAKINS Well, Hale, I better be going. Look at it this way, partner. If you wanted to get closer to God, you are about to get your wish. Hale hears Deakins' footsteps start off. \nHALE You're gonna ransom Salt Lake City, aren't you? The footsteps stop. \nDEAKINS What makes you think that? \nHALE That's where St. Judes Hospital is. You're gonna hide the nukes near the radiology department so they won't show up an any satellite radiation scans. \nDEAKINS I'm impressed. \nHALE How much are you gonna ask for? \nDeakins and Pritchett get the nuke into the back of the Humvee. \nINT. BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT \nTERRY We can go back, try to shut it down. \nHALE We don't know the code, and Deak'd have it wired to blow if we so much as look at it funny. \nTERRY Then we're... Hale looks at her. \nHALE I'm sorry. I shouldn't've let you come. \nTERRY Oh, God. Hale takes Terry in his arms, holds her. \nTERRY I ... I just hope someone remembers to feed my dog. Hale nods, hugs Terry. Terry starts to say something else, but Hale puts a finger to his lips -- he's heard something -- a distant rushing. \nHALE Come on. Hale pulls Terry, running, down the far tunnel. \nTERRY What're you --? \nHALE You said they shut down the mine when they hit an underground river. \nINT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE \nDeakins slams the tailgate on the Humvee shut. From the distance, he and Pritchett hear the whump-whump-whump of a helicopter. Deakins motions Pritchett to stay. \nEXT. MINE ENTRANCE \nDeakins comes out, looks up, sees... \nTHE NEST HELICOPTER Coming toward him, two miles away. \nINT. NEST HELICOPTER \nHunt sees something, points. \nHUNT Ten o'clock! In the clearing! \nHIS POV The blackened Humvee and Deakins by the mine entrance. \nINT. MINE TUNNEL \nHale and Terry run up. The tunnel comes to an end at a big hole. The rushing sound comes from the hole. They step up to the edge and look down. \nTHEIR POV Dark water rushes by ten feet below them. \nHALE Any idea where it goes? \nTERRY No. They look at each other. They don't have any choice. They flick on their flashlights and jump. They-hit the water and are swept from view. \nINT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE \nDeakins enters, motions for Pritchett to get into the Humvee. \nDEAKINS Get in. We're leaving. \nPRITCHETT (re: Kelly and \nJOHNSON) Aren't you going to wait for them? \nDEAKINS No time. And if they get out, they might talk. Fortunately, there's something wrong with the elevator. Deakins opens fire with his Uzi on the generator. Sparks fly and the thing shuts down. \nINT. ELEVATOR \nKelly is jarred when the elevator stops and the lights dim. \nEXT. MINE ENTRANCE \n(MORE) \nDEAKINS (cont'd) (thinks about it, \nSHRUGS) I don't know what the big deal is. \nINT.

Then the camera CLOSES IN fast on... \nDEAKINS' HAND He's holding a small black box. He presses a button and... \nINT. MINE - END OF TUNNEL \nKelly hears a click. He looks over at... \nTHE TIMER The red light goes out. The amber light comes on. A splitsecond later, the green light comes on. \nKELLY Oh shit.

Do not move or you will be fired -- \nTHE GROUND Rises up beneath Deakins. \nEXT. 4WD TRAIL \nThe Humvee races along the trail. \nIN THE HUMVEE Deakins and the dead Pritchett motor along. Deakins turns to Pritchett as if Pritchett had just asked him a question. \nDEAKINS The helicopter? It was hit by EMP. Electromagnetic pulse. It's released in a nuclear detonation. It wipes out anything electronic for miles. That\"s another reason I wanted to set off a nuke. I knew it'd bring down any helicopters coming for us. It'll also shut down all radio communications for a few hours, which will severely screw up their response. \n(GRINS) You see, Mr. Pritchett? There really is nothing for you to worry about. Pritchett's body seems to nod from the motion of the Humvee. \nEXT. COLORADO RIVER - RIVER BANK \nBUTTERFLIES Hover and dance over the water in the early morning light. \nHALE Hale has his shirt off and is wringing it out. \nTERRY (O.S.) Goddamn it! He turns to see Terry trying to undo her buttons but unable to her fingers are too numb. \nTERRY Stupid buttons. I hate these shirts. They're ugly and stupid and -- Terry suddenly starts crying. It's not the shirt she's upset about. Hale holds her. \nHALE It's okay. \nTERRY We just ... I mean, we almost... \nHALE I know. \nTERRY A nuclear bomb went off. \nHALE That it did. \nTERRY Are we...? \nHALE Look. (points at \nBUTTERFLIES) If the butterflies are okay, then we'll be okay. \nTERRY Really? \nHALE Absolutely. It says so in the manual. \"If you see butterflies after a detonation, you are fine.\" Terry looks at Hale. She knows he's bullshitting her, but she appreciates it. They look at each other. They could kiss ... but they both shy away from it. Terry gets her shirt off. \nHALE We better get moving. We might be able to reach Deakins when he gets to the river. They start off along a trail by the river. \nHALE Something I've been meaning to ask. (Terry looks at him) How did someone like you end up with a gun? \nTERRY I hit a bankrobber with a frozen chicken. \nHALE Excuse me? \nTERRY I came out here one summer during college. It was the campaign to stop the dam in the Grand Canyon. I loved it here. I came back, worked as a river guide and eventually stayed year-round. When a Park Ranger job came open, I applied. \nHALE I'm still waiting for the chicken. \nTERRY The local Parks Department wasn't sure how I'd do with the law enforcement part of the job. Well, one night I was coming home from the store and Tommy Drewson part of the local brain trust was robbing old Bob Kearney in front of the ATM. I bear old Bob yelling and I see Tommy heading for his car, so I tossed a bag of groceries at him at thirty miles an hour. A frozen chicken in the bag hit him in the forehead and he dropped like a rock. Next thing I know, I'm a Ranger. Hale looks at Terry with a new appreciation. \nEXT. 4WD TRAIL \nDeakins pilots the Humvee along the trail. \nEXT. COLORADO RIVER - RIVERBANK TRAIL \nHale and Terry are crouching behind a rock, looking down. \nTHEIR POV A zodiac raft has been pulled up on the river bank. A man with an Uzi -- SHEPPARD -- waits, duffel bag by his feet. \nTERRY Get me a frozen Zacky's fryer and he's a dead man. There's the sound of an approaching engine. Sheppard stands, gun ready. The engine stops. A few seconds later... \nDEAKINS Appears, walking down a footpath toward Sheppard. \nHale runs along the shoreline, headed for... \nA MARINA Where houseboats are rented out. Hale's eyes focus on a sign with a picture of a phone on it. \nEXT. LAKE POWELL - TRANSFER POINT \nThe back gate of the truck is shut from the inside. The truck starts up and rumbles off, slowly at first. \nTERRY Jumps up from the raft and runs after the truck, staying right behind. She grabs a handhold and pulls herself up. She holds on tight as the truck bounces off down the dirt road. \nINT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM \nLoud voices and crosstalk. Baird is on the phone, nodding. \nBAIRD Yes, sir. Creeley's phone rings. He answers it. \nCREELEY Creeley. \nBAIRD (covers phone; to \nCHAIRMAN) The President wants to know if we know where the device is headed. \nCHAIRMAN If Deakins had a plane waiting, it could be anywhere. We just don't know. \nCREELEY I do. (all eyes on him) Major Hale is alive. According to him, Colonel Deakins is headed for Salt Lake City. \nEXT. LAKE POWELL - MARINA \nArmy helicopters are landing near the marina. Two are already down. One has TROOPS standing outside of it. \nHALE, WILKINS AND GILES Are walking toward the second helicopter. \nWILKINS We found the raft on the other side of the lake. Tracks from a heavy truck ran out when they hit the paved road. \nHALE If we get a rad scanner we can track them. A brief look between Wilkins and Giles. \nWILKINS Actually, Major, we're going back to McMurran. \nHALE What? \nGILES We'd just like to ask you a few questions. \nHALE I'm not wasting time answering questions. We've got -- \nWILKINS No debate, Major. I was given orders. Now, you can come with us, or you can go with them. Wilkins nods over at the other helicopter. The troops standing in front of it are MPs. Hale looks at Wilkins, astounded. \nEXT./INT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER - IN FLIGHT \nWilkins is up front with the pilot. Hale and Giles are in back. All wear headsets. Hale is yelling at Wilkins. \nHALE Deakins thinks I'm dead. He thinks it's over. You've got to let me go after him. I can help. I know how his mind works. \nWILKINS Major, I know this is personal for you, but I think we can handle it. We're putting a wall of men and machines around Salt Lake City as we speak. That truck is not getting through. \nINT. TRUCK \nCLOSE ON THE NUCLEAR WEAPON Dusty slices of light come through the truck's slatted walls. The nuclear weapon is lashed to a hammock, straps running off to D-rings on the sides. Max is hooking up an electronic timer. \nINT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER \nHALE What about the Ranger? \nGILES What about her? \nHALE When you find that truck, you'll hit it hard. Chances are she'll be killed in the crossfire. \"Regrettable but unavoidable.\" \nGiles and Wilkins share a look -- Hale is right. \nHALE He planted that. He wanted whoever found it to think that's where he was going. (Shakes head) He's been doing a rope-a-dope. Giles and Wilkins look at him like he's nuts. \nHALE It's a boxing term. When Ali -- Look, I know this guy. If everything has been saying he's heading north, then he's heading south. They look at him, then Wilkins grabs the map. \nWILKINS What's south of here? \nECU MAP Wilkins' finger follows the train line on the map. It goes right into Las Vegas. \nHALE No. Not Vegas. What the hell is there to blow up in Vegas? Wilkins' finger keeps moving on the map. \nGILES The President. Wilkins' finger stops. \nEXT. TRAIN \nDeakins jumps the gap between two boxcars and walks on. We ANGLE DOWN to reveal... \nTERRY Crouching down between the two cars. \nINT. TRAIN ENGINE - DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT \nSheppard is working with a torch, welding the brake and accelerator controls. Deakins enters. Sheppard turns the torch down. Deakins lights a cigarette off it. \nDEAKINS How much longer? \nSHEPPARD Almost done. \nINT. TRAIN ENGINE ENGINE AREA \nBehind the driver's compartment is the engine itself, with walkways along either side. \nTERRY Creeps-up to one of the doors that lead into the driver's compartment. She hears... \nSHEPPARD (O.S.) How long until the helicopter gets here? \nINT. DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT \nDEAKINS Five minutes. We'll leave from the boxcar roof. \nDeakins turns to go. \nINT. TRAIN ENGINE - ENGINE AREA \nDeakins opens the door and strides along beside the engine. \nTERRY Is hiding on the other side of the engine, very quiet and still. As Deakins goes out the back door of the engine, Terry follows. \nEXT. TRAIN - BETWEEN ENGINE AND BOXCAR \nTerry comes out the door and is about to step across to the ladder on the boxcar when we PULL BACK to reveal... \nDEAKINS As he puts a gun to the back of Terry's head. \nEXT. GAS STATION AND MINI-MART \nA RANCHER comes out of the mini-mart with a cup of coffee and heads for his old pickup truck. He starts to open his door when he hears, incongruously, whump-whump-whump. He looks up as... \nWILKINS' HELICOPTER Comes in, gets about three feet off the ground and Giles jumps out. As Giles runs to a payphone, the helicopter pulls up and flies away, leaving the Rancher agog. \nINT. NUKE BOXCAR \nTerry comes down the ladder from the hatch, followed by Deakins with a gun. \nDEAKINS Terry, Max. Max, Terry. \nMAX (to Terry) A pleasure. (to Deakins) What the hell is a \"Terry\" and why is it still live? \nDEAKINS She asked me how I thought I was going to get away with this and I thought I'd tell her. (to Terry) We're going to a cabin in the mountains, not far from here. When we get there I'm gonna make two phone calls. \nDEAKINS It's not a problem. Set the timer, then kill her. Have fun with it. Deakins starts climbing up the ladder to the hatch. \nEXT. TRAIN \nThe GUNMAN at the caboose is firing on Wilkins's helicopter, hanging a hundred yards off the back of the train. \nINT. NUKE BOXCAR \nMax holds a pistol on Terry with one hand while he quickly sets the timer with the other. \nTERRY'S HAND Rests on Max's tool tray. Her fingers creep over to a vrench. \nMAX Presses ENTER and finishes setting the timer. \nMAX There. \nTERRY AND MAX Terry swings hard and fast with the wrench, knocking the gun out of Max's hand. Max spins, and when Terry swings at him again. Max kicks the wrench out of her hand, then steps up fast and hits Terry under the chin with the heel of his hand. She drops straight back. \nMAX Thought I was just friendly old Max, huh? Lady, I was a Navy SEAL. You should see what I can do with just my thumb. Max goes for his gun. \nTERRY'S HAND Grabs onto something. It's the wrench. \nTERRY AND MAX As Max turns back with the gun, Terry heaves the wrench. It hits Max square in the forehead. He drops like a rock. \nTERRY Yeah? Well, you should see what I can do with just a chicken. \nEXT. TRAIN - CABOOSE \nDeakins joins his man on top of the caboose, firing on Wilkins, helicopter. \nINT. HELICOPTER \nWilkins and Hale are returning fire. Hale points at Deakins. \nHALE That's him! \nWILKINS (to pilot) Get him! \nPILOT They've got guns! \nWILKINS You've got a helicopter. Use it! \nEXT. TRAIN \nDeakins and the gunman keep firing on the helicopter as... \nTHE HELICOPTER Comes swooping in. \nDEAKINS Sees what's going to happen and turns and runs as... \nTHE HELICOPTER Drops down beside the train. The rotor blades whip about three feet over the train roof and the pilot starts forward. \nDEAKINS AND THE GUNMAN Run from the blades as fast as they can. \nTHE HELICOPTER Closes fast. \nDEAKINS AND THE GUNMAN Jump from car to car. The gunman passes Deakins. Just when the helicopter blades are about to catch up to Deakins... \nDEAKINS Jumps down between two boxcars and the rotor blades go right over his head. Deakins hears an awful sound and a scream cut short. \nHELICOPTER POV Swooping fast over the train when suddenly... \nTERRY Pops up out of the hatch, her back to the helicopter. \nHALE (O.S.) Pull up! \nTHE HELICOPTER Pulls up fast. \nCU TRAIN AXLE The axle is bending, grinding, groaning. \nTERRY Is between the car carrier and a boxcar, looking down at the axle, not knowing what the hell she's going to do when she hears a horn honking. She turns. \nINT. BOXCAR \nDEAKINS Used to be, every fight was to a knockout. You know what happens when you get knocked out? It's your brain slapping against the inside of your skull. Here. I'll let you see what it's like. Ready? Deakins steps toward Hale, about to finish him off. Deakins swings. Hale ducks, comes up hard with all he's got, gets Deakins under the chin and Deakins sails up and back, landing prone, seeing stars. \nHALE Stands over Deakins, in silhouette, the light of the hatch above him. And then... \nEXT. THE TRAIN AXLE \nSnaps and... \nTHE TRAIN Jumps the tracks. \nINT. BOXCAR \nHale is thrown off his feet. \nTHE NUCLEAR WEAPON Swings wildly in the hammock webbing. \nTHE STRAPS Securing the webbing to the walls of the car start to snap. \nEXT. TRAIN \nThe front cars accordion sideways off the tracks, down a short, steep, embankment. It's all grinding, twisting, groaning metal. \nFLAMING TOYOTAS Fly, tumble, explode. \nINT. BOXCAR \nHale tries to get to his feet, but then the floor starts dropping below him as... \nEXT. THE TRAIN \nTHE NUKE BOXCAR Goes down the steep slope of the embankment and stops. \nTHE TRAIN The sounds of the crash cease. Dust and smoke. Burning Toyotas. \nINT. BOXCAR \nFlickering light from a burning Toyota comes in through the slatted walls. In this weird light, Hale sees... \nTHE NUCLEAR WEAPON It's above him, at the end (top) of the car. It's hanging in mid-air, tangled up in the webbing. Two straps are the only things keeping the nuclear weapon from dropping twenty feet to the bottom of the car. \nDEAKINS Is lying at the bottom (end) of the car, directly under the nuke, not moving. \nHALE Looks around for something. He sees it -- \nDEAKINS' REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE On the floor. \nDEAKINS' EYES Flicker open. He sees... \nA PISTOL Lying a few feet away. \nHALE \nDEAKINS (O.S.) You have to push amber, then red. You might have time to push amber. You won't get to red. Hale turns to see... \nDEAKINS Pointing a gun at him. \nHALE The nuke is armed, Deak.

Other people are lifting weights, shooting baskets. \nIN THE RING Hale and Deakins circle each other. Hale is shaking cobwebs out of his head. \nDEAKINS You know what happened there? \nHALE Hell, I barely know what day it is. \nDEAKINS I set you up. I fake right, go left three times in a row. You expect it again, I take the right in hard. That's what boxing's all about. Make your opponent think you're gonna do one thing, then do another. Like Ali in Zaire, using the rope-a-dope on Foreman. (mimes rope-a-dope) Everyone thought Ali's arms were getting destroyed, when he was really just letting Foreman tire himself out. Eighth round, Ali starts hitting, George's got nothing left -- fight's over. \nHALE The fact that I can't feel the left side of my face -- that's okay, right? Deakins laughs. Hale seizes the relaxed moment and suddenly launches into Deakins with a flurry of punches. \nTHE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE GYM Take notice -- the fight is getting real. They move to the ring. \nDEAKINS Several of Hale's punches land. Deakins staggers back, caught off guard. It looks like he might even go down. \nHALE He cocks his arm back. He could finish Deakins off. But he doesn't. He drops his fist. \nDEAKINS Seizes the opportunity and slugs back. \nTHE CROWD Loves it. \nHALE AND DEAKINS Now Deakins has the upperhand. He backs Hale around the ring. \nDEAKINS Don't watch my hands -- watch my shoulders. That's where the punch starts. Ready? Deakins hits Hale hard in the face, sending him back. \nTHE SPECTATORS Are circling the ring, following the fighters, cheering. \nHALE AND DEAKINS \nDEAKINS You were looking at my hands. Let's try it again. Ready? Deakins hits Hale hard. He's got Hale on the run. \nDEAKINS Come on. Focus. Ready? \n(PUNCH) My shoulders. Ready? Deakins fakes left, puts everything into one big uppercut. It connects. \nHALE Lands, dazed, blood trickling out of the corner of his mouth. \nDEAKINS He's in silhouette, the lights above him. \nHALE Looks up at Deakins, catches his breath. \nHALE AND DEAKINS Deakins offers his hand. Hale pushes it aside. Deakins ignores Hale, grabs him and helps him to his feet. Deakins climbs out of the ring between the ropes. Hale grabs the top rope and flips himself over, landing on his feet. Deakins gives Hale a look, laughs, shakes his head. \nINT. SHOWERS \nHale lets the water rinse the blood off his face. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nHale and Deakins are sitting on the bench between their lockers, getting into their flightsuits, pulling on boots. Deakins is smoking a cigarette. The smoke curls up into the light slanting down across the room from high windows. \nHALE'S LOCKER Is in sunlight.

Deakins grins, folds the bill and jams it into his flightsuit. \nDEAKINS You know why I beat you? \nHALE Because you've been boxing for twenty years and you're much better at it than I am? \nDEAKINS You don't want it enough. You had me today. I was back on my heels. But you didn't close the door. \nHALE We were just sparring. \nDEAKINS Life isn't sparring, Hale. \nHALE I think I saw that on a T-shirt. Deakins pulls out the twenty dollar bill; hands it back to Hale. \nDEAKINS Here. \nHALE No, that's yours. \nDEAKINS If you weren't giving it everything you've got, then I don't want it. \nHALE No, I mean -- that's yours, literally. I took it out of your wallet when you were in the shower. Deakins laughs, puts the money away. \nEXT. WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE - DUSK \nPlanes taxiing, vehicles moving. \nINT.

See if anyone can spot you. \nHALE The usual ...? \nBOONE No, actually, it's a little unusual. You're carrying a couple of nukes tonight, fellas.

Pritchett walks up behind Deakins, still nagging. \nPRITCHETT Tell me again how I don't need to be here. \nDEAKINS Mr. Pritchett, I understand your concerns. You and your associates gave me a lot of money to mount this operation. But they're getting ten times that back if we succeed. \nPRITCHETT If we succeed? \nDEAKINS All I can do is my part.

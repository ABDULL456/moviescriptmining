{"test1_input": "HALE (shakes head) Deakins'll be monitoring any radio transmissions out of here. (off her look) That's what I'd do. \nTERRY Who is this guy? \nHALE (a flash of the horrible betrayal he \nFEELS) Someone I would've trusted with my life. \n(BEAT) You've gotta get to a phone. \nTERRY Me? What are you going to do? (no answer, she \nREALIZES) Wait. You're gonna go after this guy? Isn't he going to have a lot guns and shit? I don't want to sound insulting or anything, but ... you're just a pilot. \nHALE I don't have any choice. The nukes are my responsibility. Besides... (pulls something from \nPOCKET) I do have one thing going for me. \nTERRY What's that? Hale sticks... \nA TWENTY DOLLAR BILL Under a rock. \nHALE The last thing in the world he expects is for me to come after him. Hale walks off into the light of the rising sun. Terry looks at the $20 bill. \nEXT. CREVICE SITE \nThe helicopter is parked at the edge of a deep crevice. \nDOWN IN THE CREVICE Rhodes comes down the last few feet of rope to the bottom of the crevice. Kelly, Thomas and Reed are waiting, shining lights on a B-83 lying in the dirt, all in one piece. \nRHODES (into mike) We've got one intact. (to his men) Let's go find the other one. Rhodes starts off along the bottom of the crevice. \nEXT. TOP OF THE CREVICE - BY THE HELICOPTER \nMcKellar is sitting in the pilot's seat, eating a candy bar. He turns at the unexpected sound of a truck-driving up. \nA HUMVEE climbs up the slope toward the helicopter. \nMCKELLAR Grabs his rifle, hops out of the helicopter. \nNOVACEK AND LETT Are in the Humvee. Novacek sticks his head out. \nNOVACEK Hey, you guys need any help? \nMCKELLAR It's an Air Force training exercise, sir. I'm going to have to ask you to leave. \nNOVACEK Hey, no problem. We just -- \nLETT Whips out a silenced rifle and shoots. \nMCKELLAR Barely has time to raise his rifle before he's hit. He drops. \nANOTHER HUMVEE Drives up fast. \nBAKER, JOHNSON AND PRITCHETT Get out. Johnson wears radio headgear. Pritchett is furious. \nNOVACEK Picks up McKellar's half-eaten candy bar, takes a bite. \nBAKER (to Novacek) Any sign of Deakins? Novacek, mouth full, shakes his head. \nPRITCHETT He better be dead. \nDEAKINS (O.S.) Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Pritchett. They all look over to see... \nDEAKINS Walk out of the shadows, smoking a cigarette. While soldierly with his men, Deakins is courteous and polite with Pritchett. \nPRITCHETT You said nothing would go wrong! \n", "test1_true": "PRITCHETT You didn't drop the nukes where you were supposed to! \nDEAKINS Ah, but we always planned on the search and rescue team finding the weapons for us, and they have. Mr. Pritchett, I really have thought of everything. Johnson walks up, pointing to his radio headgear. \nJOHNSON Newsflash. Two gunships just left from McMurran and they're headed this way. \nPRITCHETT You thought of that? \nDEAKINS That'll take care of itself. \nPRITCHETT What about the other pilot? We saw him eject. \nDEAKINS You don't have to worry about Major Hale. He's probably hiding behind a rock somewhere, praying I don't find him. \nJOHNSON Someone else might find him. (off Deakins' look) A Ranger called her base, said she saw a pilot come down and was gonna go look for him. Deakins thinks it over, turns to Novacek. \nDEAKINS Get ready. You'll go when the clean-up's done. Novacek nods, goes to the helicopter. Ext. Canyonlands - 4wd trail Hale and Terry are hurrying along a 4WD trail toward Terry's truck. Terry taken a look at Hale's ripped and torn flightsuit. \nTERRY Is that the new uniform? \nHALE Yeah. Less constricting. \nTERRY The dayshift guy left some work clothes in the truck. You can have them if you want. Hale nods. His feet crunch on something. \nTERRY Don't walk there. \nHALE Don't walk where? \nTERRY On that black stuff. That's cryptogamic soil. It's very fragile. One footprint takes centuries to repair. \nHALE That's a new one. Endangered dirt. Terry gives Hale a look. \nEXT. BOTTOM OF THE CREVICE \nRhodes, Reed, Thomas and Kelly move along the shadowy crevice. \nINT. HELICOPTER \nNovacek flips switches in the helicopter, getting ready to start up. Deakins reaches in, flips off a switch marked COM LINK. \nEXT. BOTTOM OF CREVICE \nRhodes hears the connection go dead. He taps his headset. \nRHODES Hello? McMurran? Come in. Suddenly, there's a soft popping sound and Reed drops. \nRHODES Reed? What the --? Rhodes looks down, sees blood on Reed. Before he can say another word, there's a fusillade of soft popping sounds as silenced bullets ricochet off the rock around them. Thomas goes down. \nINT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER \nSilence from the speakers. \nWILKINS Sam? Sam, are you there? Sam? \nEXT. TOP OF CREVICE \nLett aims a sniper's rifle down into the crevice. He flips a switch and a red laser beam stabs out from the scope. \nEXT. BOTTOM OF CREVICE \nRhodes and Kelly are pressed against the crevice wall. \nTHE RED LASER BEAN Dances along the wall, heading for them. \nRHODES Raises his pistol and shoots at the source of the laser. \n", "test1_id": 1734, "test2_input": "HALE Can you climb up? \nTERRY Yeah ...? \nHALE Give me your gun. \nTOP OF CLIFF Terry climbs up into view of... \nNOVACEK Who sees her. \nTERRY Pull herself up, stands, hands up. \nTHE HELICOPTER Novacek swivels the helicopter around. \nTERRY This has nothing to do with me. \nNOVACEK Tell me where he is! \nHALE Is down in the fissure, pointing the revolver straight up at the helicopter hovering right overhead, figuring out where to shoot. \nHALE Blackhawk ... Moved pilot seat back a foot ... Puts him right about ... here. Hale hesitates -- he's never shot at someone before -- then takes a breath and starts shooting. \nIN THE HELICOPTER The bullets fly up from below. One hits Novacek. He slumps, pushing the joystick to one side. \nTHE HELICOPTER Starts to lean over sideways. \nHALE Is surprised -- it worked!' \nTERRY Watches in horror as... \nTHE HELICOPTER'S MAIN ROTOR BLADES Angle toward her, slicing the air as the helicopter tips over. \nTERRY Dives and rolls over the edge of the cliff as... \nTHE ROTOR BLADES Hit the rock, sparking, grinding, right over Terry's head. The blades stop dead. But the torque of the motor brings... \nTHE TAIL OF THE HELICOPTER Up and over, in a high arc. \nTERRY Looks up. \nTHE TAIL --SECTION Is swinging over fast and the tail rotor is coming right for her. \nHALE AND TERRY Hale runs up, grabs Terry, pulls her to her feet as... \nTHE TAIL SECTION Swings down, rotor spinning. It digs into the dirt and sand a split-second after... \nHALE AND TERRY Run clear. \nEXT. ATOP CREVICE \nDeakins and Pritchett watch a fireball from the exploding helicopter rise up in the distance. \nPRITCHETT We don't have to worry about the other pilot? Deakins shakes his head. \nPRITCHETT Then how come the helicopter crashed? \nDEAKINS (a flicker of worry) Pilot error. Deakins turns and walks away, over to... \nBAKER AND KELLY Who have taken the three-foot, pointed, front section off each nuke. They are loading them into the back of one Humvee. Pritchett walks up behind Deakins, still nagging. \nPRITCHETT Tell me again how I don't need to be here. \nDEAKINS Mr. Pritchett, I understand your concerns. You and your associates gave me a lot of money to mount this operation. But they're getting ten times that back if we succeed. \nPRITCHETT If we succeed? \nDEAKINS All I can do is my part. We've got the weapons, we're ... (checks watch) ... seventeen minutes ahead of schedule and everything will be in place within two hours. But I can't guarantee that the assholes in Washington won't do something stupid like not pay. \n", "test2_true": "DEAKINS Then the next census for this region is going to show a very sudden drop in population. \nINT. MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM \nGiles enters and is brought over to Wilkins. \nGILES Colonel Wilkins? I'm Giles Prentice. (they shake hands) My word from your search and rescue team? \nWILKINS No. \nGILES I'm sorry. Picked up any radiation? Wilkins shakes his head. \nGILES That's kind of strange -- if there's an exposed core out there. \nWILKINS Point? \nGILES Probably nothing. I asked for a transcript of the last cockpit transmission...? Wilkins nods to a CORPORAL who hands some papers to Giles. Giles reads them quickly. \nWILKINS I don't know what you expect to find. \nCU TRANSCRIPTS We see COLONEL DEAKINS: \"This is Deakins! Hale lost it! Oh, God! I have to punch out!\" \nGILES You know these guys? The pilots? \nWILKINS Just on the radio. Never met 'em. Why? \nGILES (looks up) What if this wasn't pilot error? \nINT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM \nBaird has put Giles on speaker phone. The people in the Situation Room exchange looks. \nBAIRD No rhetorical questions, Giles. Spit it out. \nCROSSCUT WITH GILES IN MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM \nGILES In the last transmission from the plane, Colonel Deakins said Major Hale lost it and made the plane crash. We all assumed that meant pilot error. But what if Deakins meant Hale made the plane crash. Murmurs of \"That's insane\" \"No way\" fill the room. \nBAIRD Why would he do that? \nGILES Two nuclear weapons would be worth a hell of a lot of money. \nCHAIRMAN To whom? Son, there are easier ways for someone to buy nuclear weapons. You go to one of the old Soviet republics, you can get one for the price of a BMW. \nGILES I meant they'd be worth a lot of money to us. How much would we pay to get them back? To make sure they weren't used in this country? A flurry of looks around the room. \nBAIRD Hold on, hold on. (to Creeley) These nukes have codes or something that prevent people from using them. \nCREELEY Of course. \nBAIRD No one has these codes -- outside of the President and you guys. \nCREELEY Access to the codes requires the highest security -- \nBAIRD I mean, not even the pilots have these codes, right? \nCreeley starts to stammer. Baird slumps. The chairman turns. \nCHAIRMAN (to an assistant) Where's that NEST team now? \nASSISTANT They just took off. \nEXT. NEST HELICOPTER - IN FLIGHT \nA sleek, very serious-looking helicopter. \n", "test2_id": 1735, "test3_input": "Hale runs along the shoreline, headed for... \nA MARINA Where houseboats are rented out. Hale's eyes focus on a sign with a picture of a phone on it. \nEXT. LAKE POWELL - TRANSFER POINT \nThe back gate of the truck is shut from the inside. The truck starts up and rumbles off, slowly at first. \nTERRY Jumps up from the raft and runs after the truck, staying right behind. She grabs a handhold and pulls herself up. She holds on tight as the truck bounces off down the dirt road. \nINT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM \nLoud voices and crosstalk. Baird is on the phone, nodding. \nBAIRD Yes, sir. Creeley's phone rings. He answers it. \nCREELEY Creeley. \nBAIRD (covers phone; to \nCHAIRMAN) The President wants to know if we know where the device is headed. \nCHAIRMAN If Deakins had a plane waiting, it could be anywhere. We just don't know. \nCREELEY I do. (all eyes on him) Major Hale is alive. According to him, Colonel Deakins is headed for Salt Lake City. \nEXT. LAKE POWELL - MARINA \nArmy helicopters are landing near the marina. Two are already down. One has TROOPS standing outside of it. \nHALE, WILKINS AND GILES Are walking toward the second helicopter. \nWILKINS We found the raft on the other side of the lake. Tracks from a heavy truck ran out when they hit the paved road. \nHALE If we get a rad scanner we can track them. A brief look between Wilkins and Giles. \nWILKINS Actually, Major, we're going back to McMurran. \nHALE What? \nGILES We'd just like to ask you a few questions. \nHALE I'm not wasting time answering questions. We've got -- \nWILKINS No debate, Major. I was given orders. Now, you can come with us, or you can go with them. Wilkins nods over at the other helicopter. The troops standing in front of it are MPs. Hale looks at Wilkins, astounded. \nEXT./INT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER - IN FLIGHT \nWilkins is up front with the pilot. Hale and Giles are in back. All wear headsets. Hale is yelling at Wilkins. \nHALE Deakins thinks I'm dead. He thinks it's over. You've got to let me go after him. I can help. I know how his mind works. \nWILKINS Major, I know this is personal for you, but I think we can handle it. We're putting a wall of men and machines around Salt Lake City as we speak. That truck is not getting through. \nINT. TRUCK \nCLOSE ON THE NUCLEAR WEAPON Dusty slices of light come through the truck's slatted walls. The nuclear weapon is lashed to a hammock, straps running off to D-rings on the sides. Max is hooking up an electronic timer. \nINT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER \nHALE What about the Ranger? \nGILES What about her? \nHALE When you find that truck, you'll hit it hard. Chances are she'll be killed in the crossfire. \"Regrettable but unavoidable.\" \nGiles and Wilkins share a look -- Hale is right. \n", "test3_true": "(BEAT) She saved my life. Giles wants to help. So does Wilkins, but... \nWILKINS We were ordered to take you back to McMurran. You understand what orders are, don't you, Major? Wilkins turns away. Hale sits back, mind racing, not knowing what to do. He quickly grabs a pistol from the helicopter's weapons rack and puts it to Wilkin's neck. \nWILKINS Major, put that away or say goodbye to your career and hello to twenty years in Leavenworth. \nHALE If that's what it takes. \nWILKINS You'll have to shoot me. Hale thinks, but there's no way he can do that. He lowers the gun, sits back. Giles gets Hale's attention, then points to his own head. Hale doesn't understand, so Giles grabs Hale's gunhand and puts the gun up to his head. \nGILES Colonel! How about this? Wilkins looks back, sees Hale holding the gun to Giles' head. \nHALE (bad acting) I swear to God I'll shoot. Wilkins grins. \nINT. TRUCK \nMax finishes hooking up the timer. He looks at Deakins. \nMAX Ready when you are. \nDEAKINS Wait until I get back. I'm going to check on Sheppard. Deakins goes to a ladder that leads up to the ceiling. \nINT. WILKIN'S HELICOPTER \nHale is looking back and forth between what he sees out the window and the map on his lap. \nWILKINS I don't know what you're looking for, Major. Every road between here and salt Lake has already been sealed. \nHALE Deak would know that. Maybe he's not on the road. Wilkins doesn't understand. \nHALE They were using maps like these to set up the roadblocks? \nWILKINS Yes...? \nHALE Then that's the answer. Wilkins doesn't understand. Hale points outside, down at... \nTRAIN TRACKS On the ground. Old ones, half-covered by weeds. \nHALE It's an old spur. Probably hasn't been used in twenty years. Nobody bothered to put it on the new maps. \nWILKINS What are you --? \nHALE The nuke isn't in a truck, Colonel. It's on a train. \nEXT. TRAIN \nA freight train -- engine, a car carrier (carrying a load of Toyotas), several boxcars and a caboose. A hatch opens up an the roof of one of the boxcars near the tail of the train and... \nDEAKINS Climbs out and we discover that indeed they are not in a truck, they're in a train. The \"nuke boxcar\" has a small satellite dish mounted on the roof. \nTHE FOUR GUNMEN Are in position at points along the train, ready with Uzis. \nINT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER \nWilkins hangs up the radio mike. \nWILKINS Radio's still down. We'll head north, look for a phone, then look for a train. Giles nods. Hale is thinking. Wilkins starts to tell the pilot. \nHALE No. Go south. \nGILES Salt Lake is north. \nHALE He's not going to Salt Lake. \nGILES But you said it would be Salt Lake. You found that hospital tag. \n", "test3_id": 1736}

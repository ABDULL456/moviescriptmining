NINA Looks old. 
JACK Older than me. 
NINA Wow. 
Jack gives Nina a look, then begins to splash his face. Nina picks up the razor. 
JACK Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard? 
NINA Why not? 
JACK Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay? 
NINA What's a prom? 
JACK Ever go to church? 
Nina nods. 
JACK It's like that.  Only you gotta dance. 
INT.  HOTEL 
As Jack enters the hotel, he passes by the cardboard stand-up, prominently displayed in the lobby. It is virtually unchanged, except for a small notation at the bottom: "With Guest Vocalist." On the other side of the lobby, Frank is pacing nervously. 
FRANK Where the hell is she? 
JACK It's early. 
FRANK I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen. 
JACK She'll get here. 
FRANK Just like the day of the auditions, right?  Jesus.  How's my hair? 
JACK Awe inspiring. 
FRANK Yeah, well, Your's isn't. (taking out a comb) Let me run a comb though it. 
JACK Get out of here. 
FRANK Come on, stand still. 
JACK Get out of here! 
FRANK It's not gonna hurt you. 
JACK I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear. 
Frank hesitates, like a basketball player trying to feint an opponent, then takes a flick at Jack's hair. Jack hits him. 
FRANK (holding his shoulder) You hit me. 
JACK I told you I was gonna hit you. 
He looks capable of hitting him again, too. 
FRANK All right, all right.  I'm a little tense. 
JACK You're a fucking alarm clock. 
FRANK I just wish she'd get here, that's all. 
JACK She's here. 
Susie, wearing a flamboyant orange dress, is standing across the lobby, staring at the stand-up. 
FRANK Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back. (walking over) Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late. 
SUSIE Where's my name? 
FRANK What-? 
SUSIE And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster? 
FRANK We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed. 
SUSIE Changed? 
FRANK Where's your dress? 
SUSIE (to Jack) What's he talking about? 
FRANK Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it? 
SUSIE Do I look like I'm naked? 
FRANK That!  You can't wear that! 
SUSIE What's wrong with it? 
FRANK It's orange! 
SUSIE (to Jack) Am I missing something? 
Before Jack can reply, Frank grabs Susie's hand and pulls her toward the door. 
FRANK Come on. 
SUSIE Hey! 
FRANK Come on.  We don't have much time.

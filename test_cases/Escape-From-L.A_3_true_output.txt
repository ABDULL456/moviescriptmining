PIPELINE You look kinda familiar. (beat) You hang out around here much? 
But Plissken's moved off into the darkness. 
EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT - RAIN 
Plissken reaches old Mulholland Drive, now dark and desolate. Shells of houses stand nearby, black and empty. It has begun to rain. 
The sound of gunfire. Plissken ducks behind a tree... 
Two old cars come zooming up Mulholland, side by side. Windows down. Guns blazing at each other. They pass Plissken, continue down Mulholland, ripping each other apart with gunfire. Plissken darts across Mulholland, down the mountainside. 
EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - NIGHT - RAIN 
The rain pours down as Plissken makes his way down a steep incline. 
CRACK! A dark figure steps out from behind a tree. Plissken spins, submachine gun ready. It's Pipeline. 
PIPELINE Hey, man. I know who you are. You're Snake Plissken. Man, I can't believe you're really here. 
More gunfire from above on Mulholland... 
PIPELINE Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake. 
PLISSKEN Which way to the Hollywood Bowl? 
PIPELINE (points) Down that way. 
Plissken starts down. 
PIPELINE Be careful. Some real strange dudes hangin' out there these days. 
Plissken continues moving, now just a blurry figure in the rain. 
PIPELINE Hey Snake - what're you doin' around here, man? (as Plissken disappears) I heard they busted you up real good in Cleveland... 
EXT. HILLS ABOVE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL - NIGHT - RAIN 
The rain is coming down in a torrent as Plissken makes his way down the hillside. Then, all at once, the rain lets up, then stops. The trees drip with moisture. Suddenly, a huge KATHUMP from above him. Plissken looks back. A huge mudslide is roaring its way down the hill toward him. 
Plissken races down the hill, but the mudslide cascades downward like a freight train, catches up with him, sweeps him off his feet... and Plissken goes riding down the hill, rumbling and sliding in the mud. 
EXT. STAND OF TREES - NIGHT 
The mudslide hits a flat area near a stand of trees, spreads out, slows. A completely mud-covered, black Plissken climbs out of the goo. He's dripping with it. His one good eye shines in the moonlight. He takes a couple steps toward the edge of the treeline when... 
A VOICE (SPINAL) (V.O.) Shut-up, fuck! Stop makin' noise! 
Plissken spins. He's standing right next to SPINAL, the leader of the Black Cowboy Gang. Dressed in black, boots with spurs, black duster, black cowboy hat, he carries an automatic rifle. He looks just like Charles Barkley. 
Plissken looks around, realizes he's in the middle of a small army of Black Cowboys, crouched behind the trees, waiting in ambush. Covered with mud, Plissken blends right in. 
SPINAL Take cover, fool. 
Plissken jumps behind a tree, looks down the hillside. 
PLISSKEN'S POV - THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL 
Below his position is the Hollywood Bowl. A huge cross is on stage, and the cross is on fire. 
CLOSER - HOLLYWOOD BOWL 
A group of white hooded men, the K.K.K., stand in front of the burning cross holding a ceremony. Next to the cross on stage, a hooded K.K.K. string quartet begins playing a Hayden concerto. 
Plissken reacts. 
SPINAL Let's take him. 
A Black Cowboy raises his M79 grenade launcher, as the others quickly race down the hillside. He fires. 
THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL 
A 40mm armor-piercing grenade leaves a blazing fire trail as it rockets toward the burning cross and - KABLAMMO! A fireball blows pieces of the cross into the air. The K.K.K. spin around... 
A blast of lightning illuminates the Black Cowboys attacking from the hills. They open fire. A K.K.K. Grand Dragon is picked off his feet, buffeted in mid-air, flesh and robe shredded by gunfire. A hail of bullets hits the K.K.K. They return fire, but are overwhelmed. They are hit, jerking and twisting. Fire from the Black Cowboys is withering, racking the hooded figures like bolts of lightning. The Black Cowboys keep advancing, firing, as it starts to rain again. 
Through the cloudy wash of dribbling rain water, the firefight continues. Four K.K.K. leap out from behind a row of seats and jump Plissken, knocking his gun to the ground. In a blinding flash, using hands, feet, and head, Plissken sends them flying. As he reaches down to pick up his submachine gun, he sees that the rain is washing the mud off his body...

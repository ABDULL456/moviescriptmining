1944 SHOOTING DRAFT 
EXT. GARDEN CITY STATION - DAY 
CLOSE SHOT -- station signboard. It reads: 
"GARDEN CITY" 
CAMERA PANS to show the dusty platform of a typical small Arizona town of the late nineties. 
CAMERA TRUCKS ALONG platform PAST a line of sleeping figures, consisting of a couple of drunks, an Indian, two Mexicans and a mongrel dog. 
CAMERA STOPS on the window of the ticket office. Inside the office can be glimpsed the Station Agent dozing in a chair with his feet up against the grill of the ticket window. The clicking of the signal indicator is heard. The agent opens his eyes, flips up the indicator and begins to get to his feet sleepily. 
MED. SHOT 
line of sleeping figures, with dog in f.g. The sound of a distant train whistle is heard o.s. The dog, which up to now might have been dead, opens one eye and looks past camera. 
LONG SHOT

MED. SHOT 
line of sleeping figures. The dog jumps up barking furiously and runs out of shot past camera. The sleeping figures come to life and look toward camera. At the same time, the door of the ticket office opens and the agent appears. 
FULL SHOT 
railway track. The train is now almost at the station. 
EXT. PLATFORM - DAY 
FULL SHOT -- with the line of men now standing on the edge of the platform looking toward camera. Train steams slowly in past camera, and stops, with a tall, wide-shouldered man of about 28 (Rocklin), dressed in new store clothes, cowboots and a broad-brimmed white hat, in f. g. standing on steps of day coach with a small valise and saddle in his hands. Behind Rocklin a conductor. 
MED. SHOT 
baggage car. The baggageman is standing at the open door of the car with two sacks of mail. He drops them to the platform and waves to the conductor o.s. and begins to close the doors of the baggage car. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT 
on Station Agent and conductors. The latter signals the engineer. The train whistle sounds again o.s. and the shadow of the moving train begins to pass across the Station Agent's face. 
TRUCKING SHOT 
As Rocklin comes along the platform carrying the valise in one hand and balancing the saddle on his shoulder with the other, a man behind him picks up the two mail sacks and exits from scene. The station bums look at Rocklin curiously. His expression giving no encouragement, they slink back out of the sun and begin to settle down in their old places again. At the ticket office, Rocklin pauses and looks around uncertainly. 
STATION AGENT (at office door) Expectin' someone? 
ROCKLIN (after a second's pause) I guess not. Where's the stagecoach office? 
STATION AGENT (pointing) Back of the depot. 
EXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY 
The stage is drawn up in front of the depot, over which is a sign -- 
RED ROCK STAGE 
J. Harolday Proprietor 
Rocklin, making his way along the walk, almost reaches the depot when his attention is arrested by the sight of Dave, the stage driver, who has just rounded in front of the lead horses. He pauses close to one horse's head. Rocklin sees Dave take a bottle from his person, uncork it as he glances around, and raise it to drink. The bottle is almost to Dave's lips when the horse shies, swinging its head. The bottle is knocked from the old fellow's hands and smashes on the ground. Now Rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury, which he finds amusing despite its seriousness. Old Dave rants and snorts -- beats his thighs, his heads, flings his arms wildly and exhibits his utter disgust generally. 
DAVE (to horse) Consarn you, Blossom -- lookit that -- jus' lookit what you done -- (some more pantomime) I'm tellin' you, Blossom that -- (indicating broken bottle) -- makes you the most aggravatin' female as ever I had a despise fer -- I've got a good notion to pizen you -- an' what's more -- 
He stops talking abruptly because his hand has, quite by chance, felt the spare bottle he carries, which he has forgotten in his anger. A most satisfying smile lights his bewhiskered face as he brings the bottle into view. He uncorks it, and stepping a few paces from the horse, raises the bottle. 
DAVE (to Blossom) Heh-heh -- fooled you, didn't I? -- (chuckles) Fooled myself, too. 
ON ROCKLIN 
who has been watching Dave's performance. He smiles his amusement and now proceeds toward the stage office. 
INT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY 
PAN SHOT. Rocklin enters and moves over to the counter, behind which is the stage agent, a mild-looking man with pebble- lens glasses. During the scene, the character who picked up the mail sacks from the platform, comes in, dumps the sacks on the counter and leaves. 
STAGE AGENT (to Rocklin) Howdy. 
ROCKLIN (indicating stage) That the stage for Santa Inez? 
STAGE AGENT (nods) Leaving any minute. 
Rocklin puts his saddle on the counter, and taking out a wad of bills, drops them on the counter. The Stage Agent counts out the fare. 
STAGE AGENT Santa Inez -- seventeen-fifty -- (returning the balance) Name? 
ROCKLIN Rocklin. 
The Stage Agent turns to make out the ticket. Rocklin takes some tobacco and paper from his vest pocket as he glances outside. 
ROCKLIN Mind if I ride alongside the driver? 
STAGE AGENT (over his specs) It's all right with me -- if it's all right with Dave -- He's mad -- His last trip -- Had a row with Harolday, the boss -- Old-timer, Dave -- an' a grumpy old cuss.

{"test1_input": "INT. HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nThe two Comacho lookouts who survived the raid, Efren and Pompas, have been brought in for questioning. The interrogation is taking place in a small room. \nOfficers Brennan and Music are here with Eddie. \nThe Comachos sit silent as stones. \nMUSIC (to Efren) You know that, Efren. When your big bad brother Luis gets the word, your ass is freeze dried and fried. \nEfren stares ahead. Music looks at Eddie who is fiddling with the Rubic's Cube, to little success. \nBrennan takes Music's place. He kicks Pompas' chair hard. \nBRENNAN Talk you hemorrhoid! \nPOMPAS (in Spanish) Your mother fucks dogs in the street. \nBRENNAN You wanna tune-up? Hey Sarge, you know why a Comacho's like a cue-ball? Cause the harder you hit 'em, the better their English gets. \nIt's not a joke, but a threat. Pompas spits at Brennan. Brennan is enraged, but Eddie pushes him back with a hand. \nEddie faces the Comachos. \nEDDIE We're jerking off here. \nEddie goes out the door. \nINT. HEADQUARTERS HALL - DAY \nAs Eddie emerges, he bumps into the Camacho's lawyer SANCHEZ; thirty-eight, well dressed, smooth as silk. \nSanchez sees the tableau in the room. As Cusack walks down the hall the attorney follows him. \nSANCHEZ Let's cut the shit, Cusack. \nEddie ignores him. \nSANCHEZ Option 1: you can send em downtown. If Judge Collins didn't get laid last night, you can probably get him to arraign my clients for loitering in their own hallway. He'll set bail. I'll take care of it. Option 2: release them here and now and we'll call it a day. (pause) Up to you. \nEDDIE I like to see you earn your money. \nSanchez backs off. We follow Eddie down the hall. \nINT. KATES' OFFICE - DAY \nThe head of Area Four, COMMANDER KATES, is grilling Cragie and Kosalas. \nCRAGIE We come up the back stairs. We start cleanin' the hallway when the deceased pops out of a doorway with a 25 automatic. I tell him to drop it, but he's comin. We had no choice. Kosalas here saw the whole thing. \nKates turns to Kosalas. \nKATES Did you? \nKosalas looks haggard. \nKOSALAS I was on another doorway... \nKATES But you saw the action? \nKOSALAS I saw him fall. \nKATES And the kid was armed? \nKOSALAS That's the way it went down. \nKATES And you saw the weapon? \n", "test1_true": "KATES O.K. (signs document) Cragie, you'll be assigned to headquarters until the hearing -- \nCRAGIE Hearing? Who called for a hearing? The little fuck tried to shoot me in the back! \nEddie enters. Kates looks up from his desk. \nKATES Ms. Partida -- \nCRAGIE That piece of shit! \nKATES Shut-up, Cragie. (pause) Partida has demanded a formal hearing. You will be under oath so the department will provide you with a lawyer unless you've got your own. (stands) An OPS Review Board member is waiting to talk to you. Doesn't sound like you got anything to worry about. \nCragie gets up. Kosalas, sitting through this interview in stunned silence stands also. \nKATES Kosalas, you work with Cusack until this is over. \nKOSALAS Yes sir. \nKosalas and Cragie exit. \nEDDIE I ain't got no time to nursmaid a rookie. I don't need a partner. \nKATES (explodes) Your right! You don't need a partner! You need a goddamn keeper! (slams fist on desk) Jesus Christ! How do I explain this one upstairs? (stands) We gave you 600 man-hours, you took a month planning the damn thing, and what have you got to show for it? Nine bodies? A dead informant? One of my best men shot! For Christ's sake! (stares at ceiling) You're going to have me back on a beat busting perverts in the park. \nKates sits, sighs, suddenly tired. \nEDDIE We got a bigger problem. These Comachos aren't gonna take this lying down. The animals are out of the cages. \nKATES Just what I need. A goddman war. \nEddie turns to leave. \nKATES Keep track of this business with Cragie? \nEDDIE Yeah. \nThe PHONE RINGS. \nKATES I'll deal with upstairs. \nEddie starts to leave again. Kates picks up the phone, and puts a hand over the mouthpiece. \nKATES Just get me some answers, huh. \nEDDIE That's my job. \nEddie exits. \nINT. HEADQUARTERS OFFICE - DAY \nKosalas, without an attorney, is being interviewed by Partida. A court stenographer is silently typing. \nPARTIDA ...you have the right to remain silent. You have the right to have an attorney present at all times. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law... \nINT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY \nEddie and Kosalas are parked on an airport access road, watching private planes land and take off. Eddie's car, a five-year old Chevy, is wreckage. The quarter panels are rusted, the radio antenna is a coathanger, and when Kosalas pushes a tape into the cassette player, the windshield wipers start moving. \nKosalas pops the cassette out, the windshield wipers stop; he throws the cassette into the glove compartment. But now he can't get the door to stay closed. \nEDDIE I'm going to have to fix that. \nEddie has to shout to be heard over the sound of an airplane passing directly overhead. \nEddie glances at Kosalas who looks uncomfortable. \n", "test1_id": 2262, "test2_input": "EDDIE Maybe 30 years is too long for anyone to look at the city's guts, Mr. Partida. \nPARTIDA What happened to this request? \nEDDIE It was denied. \nPartida lifts another document. \nPARTIDA This is a letter of support for Officer Cragie. (hands it to him) Everyone in his unit signed it but you. (pause) Why? \nEddie glances over the letter and hands it back. \nEDDIE I don't agree with what it says. \nPARTIDA Are you saying you do not believe Officer Cragie is fit to work the streets of Chicago? \nEDDIE That's what I'm saying. \nINT. OPS HALL - DAY \nThe reporters are clustered around Eddie as he emerges but he walks past them back to the pay phone. He puts in a quarter and dials. Frowns. \nThe cops in the corridor are passing the word about Eddie's testimony, discussing it in little clusters. Their appearance is frightening. Eddie dials another number. \nEDDIE (to phone) I just dialed 348-6610, and I get this funny buzz. Check the line for me? Thanks. \nCragie, backed up by a couple of buddies, comes up to him. \nBRENNAN Seems to me the man's got his tongue stuck to his asshole, Cragie. \nCRAGIE Hey, that don't bother him. He's the fuckin White Knight. (to Eddie) You wanna take on the whole world by yourself? Now you're gonna get your chance, Sarge. \nThey walk down the hall. \nOPERATOR (V.O.) (from phone) Sorry, sir, that number seems to be out of service. I've reported it. \nEddie drops the phone. \nINT. OPS HALL - DAY \nEddie races down the hallway past hostile clusters of former friends. \nEXT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY \nRoaring north on the boulevard without regard to traffic, Eddie speeds toward his house in his rattling Chevy. \nINT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY \nEddie rockets through the red lights LEANING on his HORN. \nINT. EDDIE'S HALL - DAY \nEddie runs up the stairs, and slows when he sees Odell. The boy is sitting on the floor, head in his hands, crying. \nJust past Odell, several uniformed policemen are standing over Pirelli's body. They step back as Eddie approaches. \nCOP He was a friend of yours wasn't he? \nEDDIE Yeah. \nINT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - DAY \nEddie hurries to the bedroom and back. He rushes out of the apartment. \nEXT. EDDIE'S STREET - DAY \nEddie runs for the Chevy and peels away from the curb. \n", "test2_true": "Eddie is on the radio, speeding west on Diversey Parkway. \nEDDIE (to mike) Squad, this is 1462.

BRENNAN'S CAR - DAY \nMusic is standing on a streetcorner talking to a couple of hookers. \nDown the street, Brennan waits in their unmarked car. \nINT. BRENNAN'S CAR - DAY \nDISPATCH (V.O.) (from speaker) 1463 and 1464, Unit 1462 requesting assistance at the poolroom on 18th Street near Halsted. Questioning a suspect. \nBrennan picks up the mike. \nBRENNAN (to mike) Ten-four, Dispatch. Unit 1463 responding. \nMusic returns to the car and gets in. \nBRENNAN I could use a cup of coffee. \nEXT. POOL HALL - DAY \nEddie squeals to a stop, hops out of the car, starts for the pool hall. \nEddie enters the poolhall. \nINT. POOL HALL - DAY \nThe place is busy. Everybody in sight is either mean or ugly. Eddie enters and a dozen pair of eyes are on him. \nThe pool players not connected with this confrontation take one look at him, hang up their cues, and split. \nEddie heads for the back of the room. A pair of heavyweights fall in behind him. One of them grabs Eddie. \nHEAVY Hey, you ain't got no business back there. \nEDDIE I want your opinion I'll beat it out of you. \nEddie spins with deadly precision and catches them in mid- step and they go down like gut-shot rhinos. \nHe heads for the rear hallway and everybody clears a path. \nHe steps up to the door in back and kicks it in. \nINT. POOL HALL BACK ROOM - DAY \nA startled Camacho, DEGAS, looks up, straw in hand with a line of coke on a mirror on his desk. \nEDDIE Where is Luis? \nDEGAS Get the hell out of here. \nEddie grabs Degas by the hair and starts slamming his face into the mirror which shatters with every blow. \nEDDIE Talk to me, Degas, or I'll hit you with so many lefts you're gonna beg for a right. \nHe holds up Degas' head to look him in the eye. Blood and cocaine stain the man's face. \nDEGAS He's coming here. He's on his way. \nEddie lifts the head once and gives Degas one punch in the face that sends him ass over teakettle across the floor. \nINT. POLICE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY \n", "test2_id": 2263, "test3_input": "Beneath the lighted map of Area 4, the police dispatcher trying to raise Eddie's backup. \nDISPATCHER We need a verification on a back-up for Unit 1462... \nThe dispatcher at the next panel overhears the call. \nSECOND DISPATCHER 1462. That's Cusack, right? \nFirst dispatcher nods. \nSECOND DISPATCHER Good luck finding a backup for that character. \nINT. POOL HALL - DAY \nEddie opens the door and emerges from the back room. A dozen Comacho goons have gathered. Behind them are another two dozen hostile spectators. But no sign of the backup. \nHe pulls out his gun. The remaining innocent bystanders split for the exit. Eddie walks forward into the room. The Comachos and their soldiers stand around him. Several have guns. \nEddie keeps them under the point of his gun. He gets to the door and has to turn his back on it to keep the gang in his sights. \nA gun is pressed into Eddie's back. He drops his gun. \nLuis kicks Eddie across the room. Eddie lands at the feet of the gang. \nLUIS Take him apart. \nEddie springs to his feet, and in the same motion decks his nearest attacker. The battle is on. Hardwood pool cues crack around him. \nThe first four or five never get a chance to lay a finger on him. Battered and broken, they litter the billiard tables and floor. But Eddie is outnumbered 20 to 1. \nINT. TAVERN - DAY \nCragie and Kosalas sit at the bar. The TV is off, and the few customers pay attention to the police monitor. \nDISPATCHER (V.O.)

Finally they begin to connect. Blind-sided, he goes down and they are on him like jackals. \nThey drag him to the top of the rear stairs, and kick him down to the alley. \nIt seems like they are about to finish him off when suddenly all is quiet. The crowd parts. Eddie looks up through swollen eyes to see Luis Comacho standing above him, cool as ice. Luis reaches down and pulls Eddie's head up by the ear. \nLUIS The sun comes up. You give me Luna, or the girl dies -- slow. \nLuis kicks him in the face. \nEXT. POOL HALL ALLEY - NIGHT \nEddie opens a bloody eye and looks over his surroundings. He's alone. He moves, a joint at a time, checking himself out. \nStaggering to his feet, he opens a spiggot on the wall. He lets the cold water wash over his head. \n", "test3_true": "Donato hobbles through the deserted pool hall, his pistol in his hand. \nEXT. POOL HALL ALLEY - NIGHT \nDonato comes out the back door of the poolhall, and finds Eddie sitting on his haunches and resting against a wall between two garbage cans. \nDONATO I would have been here, Sarge. They kept it from me. \nEDDIE You're Ok, Hopalong. \nDonato holsters his gun, and helps Eddie to his feet. \nDONATO Listen, I'm havin' a drink with this friend of mine, name of Mickie. She works on a computer over in the Federal Building, FBI. I got here as soon as I heard. \nEDDIE They got Diana Luna. \nDONATO That's what I'm tryin' to tell ya.

CADILLAC - NIGHT \nTony settles in, and then sees Scalese sitting calmly in the back seat. \nTONY LUNA (surprised) Hello, Felix. \nSCALESE Hello, Tony. \nTony moves for his gun. The hood next to Tony relieves him of his gun, using his own for persuasion. \nSCALESE (sighs) You see, Tony. You make no sense. You start a war... Waste people... Money... You're like a kid, Tony. You're a bad boy. \nTony is scared. The driver spots something in the rearview mirror. \nEXT.

{"train": "CODE OF SILENCE \nWritten by \nMichael Butler, Dennis Shryack, Mike Gray & John Mason \nStory by \nMichael Butler & Dennis Shryack \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nEXT. CHICAGO - NIGHT TO DAWN \nThundering north through the glass canyons of the Loop, the elevated train SCREECHES through the city awakening. As it races north across the river past ancient factories giving way to high rise splendor, lights glistening against the dawn, we see the complex business of bringing a city to life in the morning. \nOn the Near North Side an assortment of revelers are winding up their night on the town. \nThe pressmen loiter outside the Tribune loading docks, and fishing boats are outbound through the Chicago River locks. \nA streetsweeping crew moves through the Fulton Market, Chicago's central meat and produce distribution center. \nAt the Merchandise Mart platform the elevated train picks up two old cleaning ladies wearing babushkas. \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY \nThe el train RUMBLES north past the aging tenements of Uptown into the Belmont Avenue Station. \nAnd down below, a garbage truck is slowly working its way up the alley. A garbage man in city overalls WHISTLES to the driver and the truck stops. He rolls a can to the grinding jaw as the driver sits, tense and alert, scanning the street. \nThere's something odd about this driver. And the garbage man too, for that matter. \nEXT. EL PLATFORM - DAY \nSPIDER, a nervous looking black man, steps out onto the platform. As the train pulls away we see him reach into his shirt pocket and CLICKS his ball point pen a couple of times. He WHISPERS into it. It is a concealed radio transmitter. \nSPIDER Say, hey, Cub fans, I hope to hell y'all down there cause we got a big game today. \nHe heads for the stairs and the street below. \nINT. TRUCK CAB - DAY \nThe truck cab is equipped with a police radio. The driver, RICH DONATO, adjusts the volume. Over the SPEAKER, HEAVY WITH STATIC, we can hear the SOUND of the RECEDING EL TRAIN. \nSPIDER (V.O.) (from radio) The school bus be waitin. \nDonato motions for the garbage man. \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY \nEDDIE CUSACK jumps up on the truck's running board and sticks his head in. On the seat beside Donato is a sledgehammer and a sawed off automatic rifle. The two men stare at each other as they concentrate on the CRACKLING RADIO. \nSPIDER (V.O.) (from radio) S'happenin, Doc? \nDOC (V.O.) (from radio) Hey, I got it all right here, my man. Jus be waitin on you. \nSPIDER (V.O.) (from radio) We ain't got far to go. \nEXT. EL STATION - DAY \nDOC is at the wheel of a late model Cadillac. Spider gets in and they pull slowly away from the curb. \nEXT. EL STATION - DAY \nAt the corner in a beat up Pontiac are officers MUSIC and BRENNAN. The two rough looking detectives follow Doc's car through half closed eyes. \nThey also HEAR Spider's TRANSMITTER. The quality of the reception improves as Spider and his antennae clear the steel support structure of the el platform. \nThe garbage truck GRINDS forward and halts again. Eddie comes up to the cab. He is wearing a gun under his overalls. He and Donato listen on the RADIO to the CONVERSATION coming from inside the building. \nINT. COMACHO FRONT STAIRS - DAY \nA muscular Latino, POMPAS COMACHO, leads Spider and Doc down the paint-peeling corridor. The SOUND of BABIES CRYING and FAMILIES WAKING gives a sense of teeming humanity behind every door. \nThe Latino knocks at a door heavily fortified with burglar bars. The door opens. The bars are unlocked. \nSPIDER How y'all doin? \nVOICE (V.O.) (from within) It's O.K. O.K. Como esta? \nPompas leaves the two men and heads down the stairs toward the front door. \nINT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY \nDoc and Spider enter. They're patted down. \nA sleepy eyed Latino woman comes to stand in the bedroom doorway. VICTOR COMACHO barks at her in Spanish, and she disappears into the bedroom. \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY \nEddie stands on the running board of the truck with Donato at the wheel. They listen to the RADIO. \nDOC (V.O.) (from radio) Hey, man, we're clean, huh. We ain't fools. \nSPIDER (V.O.) You do that real nice, Pancho. what say we get married. \nEddie tosses a soiled Rubic's Cube into Donato's lap. \nEDDIE Found you a present. \nDONATO Shit, those things will fuck up your mind. \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \nCragie is watching over the wall with his binoculars. He looks back at Kosalas, who is hopping from foot to foot. \nCRAGIE If you gotta take a leak, do it now. \nKOSALAS I can't go wading in with my shlong flapping in the wind. \nCRAGIE Sure you can. It's called diversionary tactics. \nCragie laughs and swigs straight from the bottle. The RADIO CRACKLES. \nBRENNAN (V.O.) (from radio) What's going on in the ballpark? \nDONATO (V.O.) (from radio) Don't get froggy. Wait for the green light. \nEXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY \nA painter's van passes Brennan's Pontiac and parks in front of the building half way up the block. \nINT. BRENNAN'S CAR - DAY \nMusic doesn't like this. \nMUSIC What the hell is this cat up to? \nBRENNAN Going to work asshole. What do you think. \nMUSIC At this hour. \nBRENNAN They got a hardass for a boss. Like us. \nEXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY \nINT. PAINTER'S APARTMENT - DAY \nTony and his men face the window across the gangway. Two of them hold sawed off double barreled shotguns. Tony counts it down, and they all fire as one. \nOne GIANT BLAST tears into the window. It disintegrates. \nThe four men toss aside their empty guns, and grab other guns. \nEXT. GANGWAY - DAY \nEddie HEARS THE GUNFIRE and hits the wall. He sees the glass showering down around him. He vaults over the backyard fence and head for the porch stairs. \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \nKosalas is finally pissing against the wall. \nKOSALAS I knew it. \nCragie is using the crate to climb the wall. He is up and over, and falls to the ground on the other side. He's still trying to get to his feet when Kosalas comes over. \nThey start running, yanking their guns out. \nINT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY \nDoc and Spider are blown backwards in their chairs. One of the cousins has fallen across the piles of money and drugs. Victor and the other cousin are slumped on the floor. The woman in the bedroom is screaming. \nThrough the jagged glass around the window frame, Tony's boys shove a broad plank. \nEXT. GANGWAY - DAY \nThree floors up, we see the \"painters\" rush across the gangway to the other building. \nEXT. COMACHO BACK STAIRS - DAY \nEFREN COMACHO, the heavyweight guarding the back door, is distracted by the SHOUTS and GUNFIRE upstairs. Eddie crashes through the door and Efren spins just in time to meet Eddie's blurring attack. \nThe struggle on the landing is brief. Efren's size is no match for Eddie's speed and power. With a grunt he sags to the floor. \nEddie leaps over him and bounds up the steps. \nEXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY \nBrennan, Music and Kobas are now on their way, using parked cars to cover their advance toward the front door of the Comacho building. \nEXT. COMACHO BACK STAIRS - DAY \nEddie passes the second floor landing and takes a quick look up the porch stairs. The door to the second floor apartment starts to open behind him. He spins and kicks it. \nThere stands a terrified old woman looking up the barrel of his gun. \nEDDIE (shouts) Police! No se mueve! \nHe spins and bounds up the stairway. \nINT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY \nThe woman is huddled in a corner, still screaming. Tony comes to stand over her, and coldly shoots her. Then he rips off his mask and goggles as his boys clear the bodies and scoop up the drugs and money from the table. \nVictor Comacho lies slumped against the wall, one side of his face and one shoulder bloodied. He appears dead, eyes open. But then he blinks once. \nINT. COMACHO BACK STAIRS - DAY \nEddie has entered the rear of the apartment. He moves cautiously forward. \nINT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY \nTony and his partners start back over the gangway to the other building. Vito is bringing up the rear. \nKosalas, down the hallway, hugs the wall, petrified. \nKOSALAS Cragie?! \nCRAGIE It's O.K. I got the sonovabitch. \nKosalas creeps ahead, gun drawn, just in time to see Cragie pull a small handgun from his pocket and lay it in the boys hand. \nCragie looks up at Kosalas and their eyes meet. \nEXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY \nLuna's van, it's windshield shot out, takes the first corner on two wheels. Behind him the police scramble for their blue and whites. Half way down the block, the van lurches into an alley. \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY \nThe van hurtles down the alley, splashing through puddles past the loading docks of a packing company. Parked along one side of the end of the alley is a meat truck from the opening montage. A loading ramp leads to the gaping rear doors. \nThe thieves have done their homework. The Luna gang slams up the ramp into the rear of the meat truck. \nA bee fy compatriot in a blood stained butcher's smock pulls several sides of beef along the rail and into the truck. With the van concealed, the line of police cars ROAR splashing by. \nINT. PAINTER'S HALL - DAY \nCragie, kneeling over the body, looks at Kosalas eyeball to eyeball. \nSCREAMS come from within the boy's apartment. \nCRAGIE (yelling into the apartment) Police! Stay where you are! \nThey HEAR FOOTSTEPS pounding up the front stairs. Cragie and Kosalas look up. \nEddie appears at the front of the hall, gun drawn. He sees the boy on the hallway floor. \nHe approaches cautiously, taking in the body, the gun, Cragie sitting against the wall, and the distraught Kosalas who stands transfixed by the dead kid. Eddie goes to Kosalas. \nEDDIE Take it easy, Kosalas. \nCRAGIE The kid didn't dust him. I did. \nEddie looks at Cragie. \nCRAGIE Him or me, Sarge. (pause) The kid saw the whole thing. \nBoth Eddie and Cragie look at Kosalas. \nCRAGIE Tell him, Nick. \nIt almost sounds like an order. \nKosalas looks like he's going to be sick. \nKOSALAS (softly) Yeah, that's how it went down. \nEDDIE (pause) Stay here. (to Cragie) Take care of your partner. \nEddie walks away. \nEXT. GANGWAY - DAY \nThe gangway is now filled with squad cars, ambulances, and cops. \nAs the paramedics walk Victor Comacho to the ambulance, bloody, bandaged, but very much alive, he and Eddie LOCK EYES for a brief instant. \nSeveral ferocious looking Comacho relatives have been allowed inside the police lines. One of them steps close to Victor. \nVICTOR (to relative) Call Luis. \nINT. HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nThe two Comacho lookouts who survived the raid, Efren and Pompas, have been brought in for questioning. The interrogation is taking place in a small room. \nOfficers Brennan and Music are here with Eddie. \nThe Comachos sit silent as stones. \nMUSIC (to Efren) You know that, Efren. When your big bad brother Luis gets the word, your ass is freeze dried and fried. \nEfren stares ahead. Music looks at Eddie who is fiddling with the Rubic's Cube, to little success. \nBrennan takes Music's place. He kicks Pompas' chair hard. \nBRENNAN Talk you hemorrhoid! \nPOMPAS (in Spanish) Your mother fucks dogs in the street. \nBRENNAN You wanna tune-up? Hey Sarge, you know why a Comacho's like a cue-ball? Cause the harder you hit 'em, the better their English gets. \nIt's not a joke, but a threat. Pompas spits at Brennan. Brennan is enraged, but Eddie pushes him back with a hand. \nEddie faces the Comachos. \nEDDIE We're jerking off here. \nEddie goes out the door. \nINT. HEADQUARTERS HALL - DAY \nAs Eddie emerges, he bumps into the Camacho's lawyer SANCHEZ; thirty-eight, well dressed, smooth as silk. \nSanchez sees the tableau in the room. As Cusack walks down the hall the attorney follows him. \nSANCHEZ Let's cut the shit, Cusack. \nEddie ignores him. \nSANCHEZ Option 1: you can send em downtown. If Judge Collins didn't get laid last night, you can probably get him to arraign my clients for loitering in their own hallway. He'll set bail. I'll take care of it. Option 2: release them here and now and we'll call it a day. (pause) Up to you. \nEDDIE I like to see you earn your money. \nSanchez backs off. We follow Eddie down the hall. \nINT. KATES' OFFICE - DAY \nThe head of Area Four, COMMANDER KATES, is grilling Cragie and Kosalas. \nCRAGIE We come up the back stairs. We start cleanin' the hallway when the deceased pops out of a doorway with a 25 automatic. I tell him to drop it, but he's comin. We had no choice. Kosalas here saw the whole thing. \nKates turns to Kosalas. \nKATES Did you? \nKosalas looks haggard. \nKOSALAS I was on another doorway... \nKATES But you saw the action? \nKOSALAS I saw him fall. \nKATES And the kid was armed? \nKOSALAS That's the way it went down. \nKATES And you saw the weapon? \nEDDIE You know, it's kind of interesting. That 16 year old in the hallway with the gun? Partida told me he doesn't have a record. The kid's never been arrested. \nKOSALAS Yeah, well, you know, if you read the papers, cops only shoot honor students. Sole support of the family and all that. \nEXT. AIRPORT - DAY \nThe airport bristles with corporate jets departing and arriving. \nTOWER (V.O.) ...Lear 9 Lima Kilo number 2 for landing -- wind south 20, altimeter two-niner-niner-two... \nAnd now comes a mystery jet, wearing no company colors, banking in over Lake Point Tower and WHISTLING low over the Planetarium to a touchdown. \nThe white Learjet taxis to a halt at the far end of the field as an undistinguished Buick rolls down the ramp to meet it. \nEddie and Kosalas stand by their car, parked across the runway from the Learjet. \nThe jet's engines shut down, the door opens, and a grim but handsome man emerges. LUIS COMACHO, a cruel and uncompromising survivor, has arrived. With him is an incredibly beautiful exotic woman. \nHe is met by Pompas and Efren Comacho, the two lookouts who survived the raid. And Victor Comacho, who was wounded in the raid, is here with his shoulder bandaged. \nEXT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY \nFrom where Eddie and Kosalas are standing it is impossible to hear the conversation at the Learjet, but it is clear that Luis Comacho is upset. They see Luis slap Pompas and Efren. Then he grabs Victor by both arms, ignoring his wound, and screams at him. \nKOSALAS Nice fellow this Luis Comacho. Donato says they call him the Angel-of-Death. \nVictor grimaces, in great pain, and his knees buckle. \nEDDIE Real sweetheart. \nINT. LUNA'S HOUSE - DAY \nIn the dining room DIANA LUNA, a pretty 19 year old, helps her 80 year old grandmother THERESA decorate a \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY\" banner, some red and green crepe paper. \nMOLLY LUNA (O.S.) Now? \nDIANA No! \nDiana and her grandmother grin at each other. They are done. Theresa stands back to admire their work. \nMOLLY (O.S.) Now? \nDIANA Mama! \nA PHONE RINGS \nDIANA Daddy, would you get that! \nDiana rushes into the kitchen and comes right out with a birthday cake, and sets it on the table next to some presents. \nTHERESA Bella. \nDiana goes to the stairs where her mother sits with her hands over her eyes. \nDIANA Keep 'em closed now. \nShe leads her mother to the dining room. \nDIANA O.K., open 'em. \nMOLLY LUNA opens her eyes. Theresa and Diana beam. Diana kisses her mother who almost cries. \nDIANA Happy birthday, momma. \nTHERESA (in Italian) Happy birthday, Molly. \nDiana hands Molly a card from the table. Molly starts to open it. \nODELL Bow to your master! \nEDDIE Later, Odell. It's been a rough one. \nODELL Y' tellin me! We all seen it on the TV! \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Odell! \nEDDIE Bow to your master. \nOdell takes off. \nEDDIE Hey, Odell. Here, make yourself crazy. \nThe kid stops, and Eddie tosses him the Rubic's Cube. \nEddie nears his apartment, we hear a MALE VOICE SINGING. \nINT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe door is ajar. Eddie lives in a modest apartment. FRED PIRELLI, a great bear of a man, 65, sings at the top of his lungs. He is bent over the space heater, tearing it apart. \nPIRELLI You look like shit. \nEDDIE Thanks, pal. \nPIRELLI They had a shot on the tube of you guys comin' out in front of the building. How's Donato? \nEddie collapses on the sofa. \nEDDIE Pissed cause he lost a shoe. (pause) Luis Comacho is in town. \nPIRELLI He'll collect himself some scalps before this one's over. Your answering machine is on the fritz again. Some woman with a fantastic voice was callin' about comin' over this weekend ta help you with somthin', and then the tape went nuts. \nEDDIE Want somthin' to drink? \nPIRELLI Does the Pope shit in the woods? Is a bear Catholic? \nODELL Me too. \nOdell shows in the doorway. Eddie gets up and the kid tosses him the Rubic's Cube -- all done. \nEddie looks at it, and the kid goes into the kitchen. \nEDDIE I hate smart ass kids. \nOdell laughs. \nPIRELLI Gonna get down in the 30's tonight. Your pilot light is out. \nEddie tosses the Cube into the waste basket and opens the refrigerator. \nEDDIE I've been told that more than once. \nPIRELLI (seriously) So, who you figure pulled out the rug? Gypsies? Mob? \nEddie comes back into the living room, hands a beer and a soda to Odell, and flops back on the sofa with his own beer. \nEDDIE Somebody knew what they were doin'. They blew the top off an anthill. \nPirelli reaches for his drink and Odell hands him the soda. Pirelli grabs the beer before Odell can drink and switches. \nPIRELLI I'd figure the Mob but Scalese ain't that stupid. (pause) Hah! Sombody put the valve in backwards. \nPirelli and Odell turn to Eddie who tries to look innocent -- but fails. Eddie purposefully studies the answering machine on the coffee table in front of him. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Odell! I ain't calling you again! \nEDDIE Drop it. \nThe controller, scared shitless, drops the hand control. \nThe Prowler dies -- the plug pulled. \nEddie smiles at Kates, and exits. \nINT. MORGUE VIEWING ROOM - DAY \nThe curtain is drawn back from the viewing window and the Comachos SEE the bodies of their cousins. Luis is here with Pompas, Efren, and Victor. Their attorney, Sanchez, has joined them. They are speaking Spanish. \nSANCHEZ (subtitle) A war does no good for any of us. It can only make what is bad worse. \nLuis says nothing. He looks through the window at the bodies. Finally he speaks. \nLUIS (subtitle) Get them out of here. Fix them up. I want them to be beautiful for their mother. \nHe kisses his fingertips and touches the glass. \nLUIS (subtitle) I promise you, my brothers, there will be blood for blood. \nSanchez sighs. \nINT. MORGUE HALL - DAY \nLuis Comacho storms out of the room into the corridor followed by the others. \nEddie and Kosalas are just entering. Victor spots Eddie and turns to Luis. \nVICTOR (subtitles) This is the cop. \nThe Comachos slow down. The two groups survey each other -- Luis, hatred oozing from his eyes. And Eddie, without slowing, looks the vicious Colombian over with cool contempt. \nEddie walks by. \nLUIS How much did they pay you to set up my brothers, Pig. \nEddie freezes, makes a slow turn, and meets Luis' eyes. \nSuddenly Eddie moves, faster than anyone else can react to, and he has Luis pinned to the wall, choking him. \nEDDIE Stay off my streets, asshole. Or I'll bite your head off, and shit in your neck. \nHe releases Luis just as quickly, and turns to walk out, Kosalas backing with him, hand on gun. \nLuis gets some air back, and starts to scream. \nLUIS (subtitle) You're meat cop! Dead meat! \nThe other Comachos have to restrain him. \nINT. MORGUE EXAMINING ROOM - DAY \nRetired detective HANK FLANNIGAN runs the high-tech morgue where the bodies are stacked on trays like bakery buns. Flannigan, a trim, bespectacled Mr. Clean, clicks his false teeth between thoughts. \nThe body on the exotic lab table is the gunman Eddie shot during the raid. Eddie is here to confirm the identification. His new partner, Kosalas, is with him, very uncomfortable in this setting. \nFLANNIGAN Eenie Verona is the gentleman's name. (looks down) You did a hell of a job on him. \nEDDIE I was motivated. \nFlannigan has already pulled Verona's record. He hands it to Eddie who passes it on to Kosalas without looking at it. Kosalas concentrates on the file, uneasy with the dead. \nFLANNIGAN Know him? \nEDDIE He's a punk. Punk thief. Booster. \nDIANA Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing? \nEDDIE I thought you knew all about cops. You don't put anything up your nose do you? \nEddie searches Diana's purse. He find her drivers license. \nEDDIE Diana Luna? (pause) You're Tony Luna's daughter? \nHe drops the license into the purse and hands it back to her. She stares him in the eye defiantly. \nDIANA I don't know where he is, and I don't really give a shit. (tired) When are you people going to realize I don't have anything to do with my father. \nEddie tries to give her his card. \nEDDIE For when you need a friend. \nShe won't take it. \nDIANA I've got all the friends I want. \nEddie puts the card into her purse. \nEDDIE But do you have all the friends you need? \nShe walks away angrily. Eddie watches her leave, and then steps over a few of the wasted witches to get to the phone on the drug laden coffee table. He dials. \nEDDIE (to phone) This is Sergeant Cusack. I want a team to cover a house on the southwest side. (pause) L-U-N-A, Anthony. (pause) Yeah. Crazy Tony Luna. I don't think he's around, but if he shows up bring him in. \nThe dope-smoking party-goers stare at this cop in shock. One of the ladies tries to casually cover the cocaine with a magazine. Eddie hangs up the phone, and pushes past them to the door. \nEDDIE (nods) Catch you later. \nHe is out the door. \nINT. GYM - DAY \nSeveral plainclothes officers, some of them women, stand on either side of the door with their backs to the wall, guns at the ready. One of the men reaches out and POUNDS on the door. \nOFFICER Police! Open up! \nThey rush the door and SMASH it, SHOUTING and scrambling into the apartment. \nKOBAS (V.O.) (from bullhorn) Awright awright hold it. \nThe instructor, Kobas, walks in criticizing their style. \nKOBAS For Christ's sake! You tryin to get your partner killed, Jackson? \nThis is not the real thing; only practice. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL -- \nINT. GYM - DAY \nThe apartment is only a mockup set in the corner of this vast skylit city warehouse. Runners race around the track at the perimeter. \nOn the wall are large photos and diagrams of the Prowler. Below the photos are sign-up sheets for the required training sessions. \nIn another corner is the weight room, the ring, and the workout area. Eddie is here, working out, sparring with a partner who has large padded mits on each hand. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nBrennan and a couple of buddies approach Kosalas as he ties his gym shoes. Brennan is carrying a petition. He hands it to Kosalas and looks around the room. He spots another cop. Cragie is in the background putting on his jacket. \nBRENNAN (shouts across the room) Hey, Mahoney. I want you to help me get some signatures on this letter for Cragie. \nBrennan looks down at Kosalas who is hesitating. Kosalas looks back at Cragie. There eyes meet. He signs. \nLuis Comacho is in the limo along with the woman from the airport. \nINT. BRENNAN'S CAR - DAY \nBrennan and Music are following the procession. Brennan is on the radio. \nMUSIC (to mike) The funeral director says they plan on cruisin right past luna's house. \nEXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY \nTito, one of Tony Luna's bodyguards, watches from the steps of Luna's porch as a procession of cars follows the hearses slowly up the street. \nAt the end of the block, an old man is selling produce to the neighborhood housewives off the tailgate of his truck. They watch the procession in wonder. \nINT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY \nThe cortege passes the unmarked car down the block from Tony's house. Eddie is watching. Kosalas is with him. \nKOSALAS (to radio) They're wastin' the show. Tony's not even in town. \nEDDIE He'll get the word. \nAcross the street, WE SEE another bodyguard joint Tito on the front steps. They stand, arms folded, watching the procession. \nINT. LIMO - DAY \nLuis Comacho takes a flower and tosses it out the window as he cruises past the two goons. Their EYES LOCK.

LUNA'S HOUSE - DAY \nTito, the body guard, picks up the phone. \nEXT. LAKE - DAY \nAt the pay phone next to a lakeside bait shop, Tony Luna is getting the word. He's worried. \nLUNA (to phone) What the fuck are you talkin about? Nobody's gonna touch nothin. Just stay put. (pause) I give a shit about their fuckin parade? \nA floozy slides up next to him, and he puts an arm around her waist. \nLUNA (to phone) They wanna throw flowers we can fix it so they're pushing up daisys. \nHe laughs. The girl joins in like she's supposed to. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY \nA tan Dodge rolls over the rutted scrapyard roadway, bouncing toward the immense old warehouse along the river's edge. The city seems to have abandoned this remote industrial area; giant grain elevators, rusting freighters and vast scrapyards surround us. \nINT. POMPAS' CAR - DAY \nPompas and Efren Comacho drive through the gate and enter the warehouse as the door opens for them. \nINT. WAREHOUSE - DAY \nThe car halts in the vast empty chamber.

The trunk is filled with cases of heavy ammunition. \nAt the back of the warehouse, other Comachos are test firing their weapons. \nINT. LUIS' OFFICE \nLuis is directing things as they are preparing for battle. The weaponry spread on the table is astonishing. \nEXT. HARBOR - DAY \nEXT. WABASH AVENUE - DAY \nIn the shadow of the el tracks, Diana runs for her life, racing north on Wabash through crowds of shoppers with the Comachos moving relentlessly a half block behind. \nOpposite Marshall Field's, she abruptly cuts across traffic and runs into an alley between the giant men's and women's stores. \nWith terror in her eyes, Diana runs, searching frantically for a guard, a policeman, somebody with a gun. But the Comachos are closing in on her. \nShe dives through a revolving door into the building. \nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY \nDiana runs past the perfume displays, notions, and lingerie, and out the Randolph Street exit. \nEXT.

But the Comachos round the corner just in time to catch a glimpse of her. \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY \nThis alley leads to the lower level of Michigan Avenue. She turns back to find the exit blocked by the Comachos. She flees downward. \nINT. LOWER MICHIGAN - DAY \nThe green flourescents of the \"Emerald City\" give a deathly cast to the underground street as Diana rounds the corner, and collapses against the wall. Her heart pounding like a frightened deer, she has run as far as she can. \nPompas Comacho and two of his colleagues come racing around the corner. They spot her crouched against the wall. \nShe starts to SCREAM but Angel grabs her by the collar and pulls her up to his face and she stops, wide-eyed with terror as he touches her throat with his knife. \nPOMPAS Come on, Chika. We gonna have some fun. You gonna take us to your father. \nWe hear a loud metallic CLICK. We see the barrel of a huge revolver. They wheel to see Eddie crouched, gun drawn, in the alley entrance. \nEDDIE Pompas, you're getting to be a fucking pain in the ass. \nThe boys put their hands up, but Eddie doesn't see the third, SAMO, coming up behind him. \nAngel grabs Diana by the hair, shielding himself, and starts backing up the stairs that lead to the street. \nEDDIE Let her go, pooch. \nSamo jumps Eddie, and the gun goes flying. It hits the pavement and bounces off the high curb into the street. \nIn a staggering blur Eddie takes out the Comachos, kicking the last one end over end. But Angel and the girl have disappeared to the street above. \nEddie retrieves his gun and runs up the steps. \nEXT. STATE LAKE EL STATION - DAY \nWith a knife at her side, Angel Comacho leads Diana up the steps of the old el station.

Angel searches frantically for a way out. \nDIANA I'll take my chances. \nNOTE: Ad lib dialogue throughout scene for possible later use. \nNOTE: Radio newscast describing the Luna killings can be mixed with the above dialogue. \nINT. EDDIE'S HALL - NIGHT \nEddie and Diana climb the stairs. \nINT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe DOORBELL buzzes repeatedly. \nPIRELLI (shouts) Keep your goddamn pants on! \nPirelli, padding across the floor in his shorts, looks like a bear called out of hibernation. He has a service revolver in his hand. He peers through the peep hole, then unbolts the door. \nPIRELLI This your idea of a social call? \nEddie enters with Diana. \nEDDIE Fred Pirelli, this is Diana. Diana Luna. \nPirelli reacts to the name. \nDiana is in a daze, close to shock. \nPirelli takes her and leads her to the couch. \nPIRELLI C'mon, kid. Let's get you off your feet. \nEddie motions him aside. \nEDDIE Can you put her up till I find her old man? \nPIRELLI Does a bear...? \nEDDIE Am I putting you on the spot? \nPIRELLI I spent 30 years on the spot. What ever you need. \nEddie starts to go, and Diana reacts, suddenly frightened. \nDIANA Eddie? \nEDDIE I'll be right across the hall. I'm just gonna clean up. \nHe leaves. \nINT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT \nEddie falls fully clothed onto the mattress. The PHONE RINGS. \nHe rolls over in disbelief, staring at the ceiling. \nIt RINGS, and RINGS again and again and again. He finally picks it up. \nINT. TAVERN - NIGHT \nThis is the after-hours watering hole for the police force and half the cops we've seen so far, including Cragie, are clustered at the bar or playing darts at the back of the room. There are a half a dozen women there also. Three of them are cops. \nKosalas is here too. He's been drinking. He leans against the wall talking on the pay phone by the men's room. \nKOSALAS (to phone) Say, Eddie. Why don' you come by and tip a few? (pause) Cause I gotta talk to you. (pause) Yeah, I know. But we gotta talk. (pause) Please. (pause) Yeah, at Mike's. \nHe hangs up and heads back to his table, passing Officer Music at the bar. \nEDDIE Not now, Donato. \nDONATO O.K. O.K. But just let me plant two words in your brain. Alligator farming. \nEddie shakes his head and walks to the back of the room where Kosalas sits hunched over a drink, the only man in the room not laughing. He looks up whens Eddie pulls over a chair. \nKOSALAS Beer? \nEddie nods, and Kosalas signals the waitress. There is a long beat at Kosalas fidgets and Eddie waits. \nKOSALAS Looks like I'm caught between the rock and the hard place, Sarge. \nEddie just looks at him. \nKOSALAS You know I really wanted to be a good cop, but... shit. It's hard enough sometimes just to stay alive. Comes so easy to you. You got all the fuckin' answers. Me, I'm still tryin' to find the questions. \nEddie is still silent. Kosalas takes a swig of his beer, and finally blurts is out. \nKOSALAS Cragie planted the gun on the kid. Just wasted him, and then I... I don't know what to do about the hearing tomorrow... \nEDDIE Tell the truth. \nKOSALAS See. It's all so nothin' for you. If I talk straight every cop on the force will shit on me. If I don't... Cragie gets away with murder. \nEDDIE And the chance to do it again. Next time he might take away a cop. That make any difference? \nKOSALAS He's my partner. \nEDDIE Your partner's selling you out, Kosalas. He kills an unarmed kid, and now he's risking your ass to save his own. \nKOSALAS It was a mistake. \nEDDIE It cost an innocent kid his life. \nKOSALAS I know that! I KNOW THAT! \nHe is too loud, and attracts attention. \nKOSALAS (softly) Jesus. I see that kid's face every time I close my eyes. \nEDDIE Tell 'em like it is, Nick. I'll back you up. \nEddie gets up and walks away. \nINT. TAVERN - NIGHT \nThe two amateur holdup men are being hustled out to the paddy wagon as Eddie heads for the door. Someone grabs his arm. \nIt's Cragie, a little drunk. \nCRAGIE Nice to see you out with the boys for a change, Sarge. \nEDDIE Hello, Cragie. \nCRAGIE They tell me my Sergeant wouldn't sign for me. You want to tell me why? \nEDDIE You know why. \nCRAGIE No. Tell me. \nEDDIE (gently) You were a good cop for a lot of years. You've passed your limit now Cragie. \nCRAGIE Fuck you. Where do you get off? \nEDDIE Right about here. \nEddie walks out the door. \nCragie is neat as a pin, humble, cooperative to a fault. \nPARTIDA You have heard her tell this panel that she saw you lay the gun in her grandson's hand. \nHe feigns compassion. \nCRAGIE I'm not saying the woman would make this up. But there's no way she could have seen anything from where she was standing in a hallway that dark. (pause) Like you said, she's the boy's grandmother. \nPARTIDA If it was dark, Officer, how were you sure Vega had a gun? \nCRAGIE We were lucky. There was a glint of light, a reflection comin off the barrel of the weapon. \nEXT. EDDIE'S ALLEY - DAY \nA carload of Comachos, including Luis, cruises down the street and parks in the alley next to Eddie's building. \nINT. OPS HALL - DAY \nThe hearing is in recess and the hall is filled with smokers and coffee drinkers. \nEddie is getting a BUSY SIGNAL on the pay phone. \nDonato approaches. \nDONATO You think he'll get a pass? \nEDDIE You heard it all. What do you think? \nDONATO If the hearing was over I'd have to put my money on the old lady. (smiles) But Kosalas's next. My bet's on Cragie. \nEDDIE The kid may surprise you. \nEddie dials the number again. Still a busy signal. \nINT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - DAY \nPirelli has Eddie's answering machine plugged in, and is tinkering with the insides. \nDiana comes into the living room, toweling her wet hair, just out of the shower, but in her street clothes. \nINT. HEARING ROOM - DAY \nKosalas is on the witness stand. \nPARTIDA And right after you heard Officer Cragie's gun discharge, what did you do then? \nKOSALAS I immediately advanced down the hall. \nPARTIDA And what did you see? \nKOSALAS The deceased, Vega, lying on the floor. Officer Cragie was checking his vital signs. \nPARTIDA What happened then? \nKOSALAS We recovered a .25 calibre automatic from the teenager's right hand. \nPARTIDA Did you see that weapon in Vega's hand before Officer Cragie fired? \nKOSALAS Yes, sir. \nCragie leans back. \nA ripple is felt in the crowd. The reaction of the boy's relatives, delayed by translation, is one of outrage. \nPARTIDA No more questions. \nAs Kosalas steps down he keeps his eyes on the floor ahead of him avoiding eye contact. \nEDDIE Maybe 30 years is too long for anyone to look at the city's guts, Mr. Partida. \nPARTIDA What happened to this request? \nEDDIE It was denied. \nPartida lifts another document. \nPARTIDA This is a letter of support for Officer Cragie. (hands it to him) Everyone in his unit signed it but you. (pause) Why? \nEddie glances over the letter and hands it back. \nEDDIE I don't agree with what it says. \nPARTIDA Are you saying you do not believe Officer Cragie is fit to work the streets of Chicago? \nEDDIE That's what I'm saying. \nINT. OPS HALL - DAY \nThe reporters are clustered around Eddie as he emerges but he walks past them back to the pay phone. He puts in a quarter and dials. Frowns. \nThe cops in the corridor are passing the word about Eddie's testimony, discussing it in little clusters. Their appearance is frightening. Eddie dials another number. \nEDDIE (to phone) I just dialed 348-6610, and I get this funny buzz. Check the line for me? Thanks. \nCragie, backed up by a couple of buddies, comes up to him. \nBRENNAN Seems to me the man's got his tongue stuck to his asshole, Cragie. \nCRAGIE Hey, that don't bother him. He's the fuckin White Knight. (to Eddie) You wanna take on the whole world by yourself? Now you're gonna get your chance, Sarge. \nThey walk down the hall. \nOPERATOR (V.O.) (from phone) Sorry, sir, that number seems to be out of service. I've reported it. \nEddie drops the phone. \nINT. OPS HALL - DAY \nEddie races down the hallway past hostile clusters of former friends. \nEXT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY \nRoaring north on the boulevard without regard to traffic, Eddie speeds toward his house in his rattling Chevy. \nINT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY \nEddie rockets through the red lights LEANING on his HORN. \nINT. EDDIE'S HALL - DAY \nEddie runs up the stairs, and slows when he sees Odell. The boy is sitting on the floor, head in his hands, crying. \nJust past Odell, several uniformed policemen are standing over Pirelli's body. They step back as Eddie approaches. \nCOP He was a friend of yours wasn't he? \nEDDIE Yeah. \nINT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - DAY \nEddie hurries to the bedroom and back. He rushes out of the apartment. \nEXT. EDDIE'S STREET - DAY \nEddie runs for the Chevy and peels away from the curb. \nThis bi-level street is as different as night and day. The lower level's eerie green lights make us feel like we're under water. Iron girders and concrete pillars support the street above. \nLOW WIDE ANGLE \nThe Cadillac races through this vast man-made cavern, past the sub-level loading docks and service entrances of skyscrapers above. City work crews and all night commercial deliveries dot both the upper and lower levels of the chase. \nINT. EDDIE'S CAR - NIGHT \nEddie is gaining in the battered Chevy. The Cadillac rockets up the next ramp to the street level. \nEXT. UPPER WACKER - NIGHT \nThe Cadillac zooms up from below, crosses the intersection, and immediately takes the next down-ramp. Eddie flies up from below, briefly airborne, barreling after them into the tunnel. \nEXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT \nA block later the Cadillac heads topside again. Eddie takes a gamble and goes straight ahead. \nAt the next down-ramp, the Cadillac descends and Tony's boys find themselves doing 70 knots side by side with Eddie in the other lane. \nIn the narrow concrete tunnel, the two cars battle each other like bulls in a chute, each one trying to cut the other off, bouncing from each other into the walls and back again. \nINT. CADILLAC - NIGHT \nThe goon next to Luna is trying to get a shot off at Eddie. \nSCALESE This sonovabitch is crazy! \nTony sees his chance and he lunges for the gun. In the struggle, the gun goes off and drills Rocco, the driver, through the side of the head. \nEXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT \nThe Cadillac ROARS out of control, its dead driver's foot pressing the accelerator to the floor. Scalese, in the front seat, tries to grab the wheel. \nEddie is all over the road trying to avoid them. The river and the curve are ahead. \nScalese's car hits the median at high speed, rolls, and slides SCREAMING into a concrete pillar and EXPLODES. \nEddie stands on the brakes as his car slides alongside the flaming wreckage. \nINT. EDDIE'S CAR - NIGHT \nEddie's car is on fire now, and the doors have been rammed shut. He kicks the window out on the passenger side. \nEXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT \nEddie runs for his life. The explosion knocks him to his knees. \nHe gets up and moves away, looking back at Luna's and Scalese's spectacular funeral pyre. \nEXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT \nThe fire engines and police cars are arriving from every direction. \nWith the flames still lighting his face, Eddie is making a call. \nEDDIE You tell Luis I got Tony Luna for him. Get me a time and place. \nINT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nDiana is in bad shape. She is tied up. Numb with terror she listens, not comprehending, as the Comachos discuss their plans for her in Spanish. \nLuis comes over to her, and with his knife begins cutting off part of her clothes. \nLUIS Your cop friend is smart. Too smart and he dies. Then I take care of you personally. \nEXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT \nWith one hand Kosalas slams Cragie again, and reaches down with his free hand, lifting Cragie's pants leg and extracting a drop-gun from it's concealed holster. \nKOSALAS What's this for partner? Your next fuck up? \nKates steps in and separates them. \nKATES (to the others) Get someone in the air. We're gonna find Cusack. \nINT. WAREHOUSE - DAY \nDiana, now hanging from her wrists like a slab of beef, is guarded by a couple of Luis' boys, eyeing her hungrily. \nLuis enters. \nLUIS (subtitles) Take off the gag. I want them to hear her. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY \nLuis scans the daybreak sky. He and Efren take up positions. Above them and around them, every line of fire is covered. \nEXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY \nFrom the lookout's POV atop the towering grain elevator, WE SEE several garbage trucks moving in and out of an adjacent dump. \nOne of them seems familiar to us. \nINT. TRUCK CAB - DAY \nEddie's eyes search the harbour as he maneuvers slowly alongside a rusting freighter. He stops and gets out. \nEXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY \nEddie opens the rear of the truck and lowers a ramp. \nEDDIE Here we go partner. \nHe picks up his gun and a duffle bag from the cab and heads out. \nINT. WAREHOUSE - DAY \nThe Comachos are ready and waiting. Luis walks through the middle of the vast empty plant toward the front, checking on his troops one last time. \nEXT. DOCK - DAY \nAgainst the grotesque shapes of the surrounding scrapyards, Eddie moves quickly from one concealment to the next, crouched low, advancing on the abandoned factory at the end of the dock. \nHe lays down his duffle and pulls out a Halliburton case. He opens it. \nEXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY \nFrom inside the garbage truck WE HEAR an ENGINE STARTING. It REVS a couple of times. And from within the container compartment of the truck emerges the Prowler. It clatters down the ramp. \nEXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY \nThe lookout spots the Prowler moving down the dock. He can't believe his eyes. \nHe sights on the machine and FIRES. \nAnd in the distance, the Prowler senses the insult and immediately turns its camera eye up to him. \nThe lookout FIRES again. Immediately, the turret swivels and the twin MACHINEGUNS ROAR. \nIt's a long way down. \nINT. WAREHOUSE - DAY \nThe SOUND of MACHINEGUN FIRE from outside galvanizes the Comachos. Luis runs through the long building toward the front with half a dozen of his men, all SHOUTING. \n", "test1_input": "EDDIE (V.O.) Just watch, kid. Learn. \nDiana leaves the children with the zoo lecturer. \nDIANA Be back in a minute. \nShe crosses to the two goons and looks up at Gamiani. \nDIANA What do you want? \nLOU Your Papa worries about you. \nDIANA Get out of here, Lou. Leave me alone. \nGamiani shrugs, his pal Tito seems embarrassed, but they don't move. \nINT. GORILLA HOUSE - DAY \nThe CHILDREN SCREAM, and LULU, the half-ton baboon flies into frame, swinging down from the artificial branches of an iron tree in the three story central cage. The children clutch at Diana in delightful terror. The gorilla, inches away, kisses the thick glass that separates them. \nLulu swings to the upper branches and sits, arms crossed, staring eyeball-to-eyeball at her human counterpart, Gamiani. Tito eats popcorn. \nEddie and Kosalas walk behind a mother and child, each holding a balloon. \nEXT. LIBRARY - DAY \nDiana is on the front steps of the library saying good-bye to two of the children from the zoo. She hands them over to their mothers, and goes up the steps into the building. \nGamiani and Tito pull over and park down the street. \nEddie comes around the corner, and follows her in. \nINT. LIBRARY HALL - DAY \nThe sign on the door tells us this is the city's Special Education Program office. Diana enters the office and confers briefly with another staff member. \nINT. LIBRARY HALL - DAY \nThrough the open door of the Special Education Program office, Eddie observes Diana chatting with her co-workers. \nINT. READING ROOM - DAY \nEddie follows as Diana walks through the great hall past long tables and out the other door. \nEXT. LIBRARY - DAY \nDiana comes down the steps, wading through the swarm of homebound commuters, and catches a cab. \nAnd head and shoulders above the crowd, scanning the tops of heads, is Lou Gamiani. \nTito comes around the corner in his car, and pulls up to the curb. Gamiani jumps in, and they take off after Diana's cab. \nEddie and Kosalas follow in Eddie's car. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nDiana enters an apartment building. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nBy the time Diana exits it is dark. She is with a friend, and both are in some kind of Halloween costume. They catch a cab. \nEXT. PARTY STREET - NIGHT \nThe taxi stops in front of an ancient brick loft building. Diana and her friend get out and hit the buzzer at an unmarked door. The door opens and they disappears inside. \nGamiani's car cruises past. It pulls up at the corner and it's lights switch off. \n", "test1_true": "INT. EDDIE'S CAR - NIGHT \nEddie leans down to the open drivers window. \nEDDIE Hold here a second. \nEddie goes to the back of the car, and Kosalas follows him in the rearview mirror, losing sight when Eddie pops open the trunk. \nKosalas watches the party goers enter the building. \nThere is a tapping at the window. \nEddie has donned a baseball uniform, matching cap, and now carries a baseball bat with a pair of cleats hanging from it. \nEDDIE Keep with Gamiani. \nEddie tosses the keys back to Kosalas, and heads to the building. Kosalas calls to him. \nKOSALAS Bang a few for me. \nINT. PARTY STAIRS - NIGHT \nIn the darkened stairway Eddie joins a group of outrageously dressed characters. The door at the top of the stairs bursts open on a punk-funk art student Halloween party. \nINT. PARTY - NIGHT \nA hundred people are jammed into the studio. It feels like the Star Wars Saloon. The LIVE MUSICIANS match the look of the party. The costumes are outrageous. Everyone is dancing. \nEddie looks the place over. He spots Diana. \nEddie walks over to her, grabbing a drink along the way. He sidles up to Diana. \nEDDIE Wanna play ball? \nShe looks him over taking in the outfit, the bat. \nDIANA Are you pitching? \nEDDIE Some people say I've got a pretty good inside curve. \nDIANA I don't know. You look strictly minor league. \nShe smiles. \nEDDIE I'm Eddie. \nDIANA I make it Eddie-The-Cop. \nEDDIE You've had a lot of experience with cops? \nDIANA All bad. \nShe is angry now, and walks away from him. \nEddie watches her go, and is about to follow. He sets his drink down, and turns to find a girl, luscious as hell, dressed like a Frederick's wet dream, making eyes at him. She takes his bat, and gives it a long, lascivious lick. \nEDDIE You'll get slivers. \nHe walks by her. \nINT. PARTY BACK ROOM - NIGHT \nEddie steps over and around an assortment of wasted witches and gooned out goblins snorting lines on the coffee table to get to Diana who is tensely by herself. \nHe grabs her purse. \n", "test2_input": "Kosalas is still sounding the HORN. \nEXT. HARBOR - DAY \nEddie runs toward the car. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - DAY \nA body lies in the flowers in the service area next to the giant greenhouse. Several unmarked cars and two blue and whites are parked in the dirt drive as Eddie and Kosalas pull up. The cops have roped off the area. Music and Brennan are there. \nEddie looks at the body as Music comes over. \nMUSIC Tony Luna's bagman. \nKosalas looks at the body. \nMUSIC They call that a Columbian necktie. \nKosalas winces. \nMUSIC They found the manager of Tony's restaurant hanging from a hook in his kitchen. Looked like someone tried to carve a canoe out of him. Tony's used car lot on Ashland is burning as we speak. The head salesman is a fried zuccini. \nKOSALAS Oh Jesus. It's starting. \nEddie stands to one side. \nEDDIE Let's go. \nEXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY \nA kid on a bike makes his way up the quiet tree-lined street, tossing newspapers onto the porches of the block. \nAround the corner at the end of the block, the produce truck starts slowly forward. As it turns onto Luna's block, a car pulls up behind it and stops, blocking the street. \nThe produce truck parks at the curb in front of the Luna house. A neighbor from across the street approaches. The front door of Luna's house opens, and Tito emerges, helping Tony's aged mother down the steps to buy vegetables. \nINT. PRODUCE TRUCK - DAY \nOn the floor near the wheelwell is the dead produce man. \nEXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY \nThe rear doors of the produce truck swing open. The neighbor, Tito, and Tony's mother are instantly killed. \nFrom outside three Comachos enter the open front door of the Luna house. We hear the SOUND of MUFFLED GUNFIRE from inside. \nINT. LUNA'S HOUSE - DAY \nBits and pieces. A Shattered orange juice container. Eggs cooking on the stove. A woman's vanity. \nOn the floor; a woman's legs, a housecoat, slippers.

LIBRARY - DAY \nDistracted for an instant by a cluster of conventioneers, Lou fails to notice the two Comachos who have fallen in step behind them. He goes down with a gasp, almost silently, a knife sticking from his back. A Comacho grabs Diana's arm. She jabs him in the eyes, and runs. \nDiana disappears into the crowd. \nHysterical citizens scatter in all directions. A woman stands in horror unable to keep from looking at Gamiani's body lying on the sidewalk. She SCREAMS. \nEddie and Kosalas come crashing out of the entrance of the museum. \nThe girl isn't here. \nEddie spots a commotion at the end of the block, under the el station. \nHe dashes down the steps and across the street with traffic screeching to a halt. \nKosalas flags down a blue and white, and barks for backup, then tears out after Eddie. \n", "test3_input": "Beneath the lighted map of Area 4, the police dispatcher trying to raise Eddie's backup. \nDISPATCHER We need a verification on a back-up for Unit 1462... \nThe dispatcher at the next panel overhears the call. \nSECOND DISPATCHER 1462. That's Cusack, right? \nFirst dispatcher nods. \nSECOND DISPATCHER Good luck finding a backup for that character. \nINT. POOL HALL - DAY \nEddie opens the door and emerges from the back room. A dozen Comacho goons have gathered. Behind them are another two dozen hostile spectators. But no sign of the backup. \nHe pulls out his gun. The remaining innocent bystanders split for the exit. Eddie walks forward into the room. The Comachos and their soldiers stand around him. Several have guns. \nEddie keeps them under the point of his gun. He gets to the door and has to turn his back on it to keep the gang in his sights. \nA gun is pressed into Eddie's back. He drops his gun. \nLuis kicks Eddie across the room. Eddie lands at the feet of the gang. \nLUIS Take him apart. \nEddie springs to his feet, and in the same motion decks his nearest attacker. The battle is on. Hardwood pool cues crack around him. \nThe first four or five never get a chance to lay a finger on him. Battered and broken, they litter the billiard tables and floor.

Finally they begin to connect. Blind-sided, he goes down and they are on him like jackals. \nThey drag him to the top of the rear stairs, and kick him down to the alley. \nIt seems like they are about to finish him off when suddenly all is quiet. The crowd parts. Eddie looks up through swollen eyes to see Luis Comacho standing above him, cool as ice. Luis reaches down and pulls Eddie's head up by the ear. \nLUIS The sun comes up. You give me Luna, or the girl dies -- slow. \nLuis kicks him in the face. \nEXT. POOL HALL ALLEY - NIGHT \nEddie opens a bloody eye and looks over his surroundings. He's alone.

You're a bad boy. \nTony is scared. The driver spots something in the rearview mirror. \nEXT.

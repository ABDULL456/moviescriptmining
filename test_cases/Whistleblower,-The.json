(UKRAINIAN) I can't see anything... Are you there? \nSilence. \nGIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) (UKRAINIAN) (CONT'D) Are you there!? \nGiggling. LUBA, 15, dangerous, flicks a lighter, sparking a cigarette, and grins in the flickering flame. \nLUBA (UKRAINIAN) God I'm drunk... Where's this damn door? \nShe scans the space with the lighter. Illuminating... \nRAYA (UKRAINIAN) Watch it! That's my hair! Let me try. \nRAYA, 15, pretty, guileless, takes the lighter, searching... CLICK. She has it. They BURST out the door, LAUGHING, onto... \n2   EXT. ROOFTOP - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                       2 \nA PARTY. ROCK MUSIC BLARES. DRUNK TEENS dance around BURNING BARRELS. GROUPS lounge on ratty couches and turned over boxes skulling cans, making out, talking shit. A BOY, 17, lights a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL and hurls it off the roof. \nLuba and Raya join THREE GUYS. ONE of them pisses onto a cloth, stuffs it in a bottle, and tries to light it. It FIZZLES. Everybody bursts out laughing. \nRAYA (UKRAINIAN) It's ammonia, not alcohol. \nBOY (UKRAINIAN) (Drunk) You're so smart. I love you! \nHe lunges in for a kiss, but she dodges him, laughing. Luba gives him the finger, pulling Raya toward the dancing into... \nTEEN MAYHEM: Raya lets herself go. She gets lost in... \nA WHIRL of drunk and happy teens. It's tribal. They dance, silhouetted against the fire and the black sky, their backs to the run-down Soviet buildings... Tonight, they don't want to think about what life holds in store. \nRaya stops. Dizzy. She looks at her watch, suddenly aware of the time. Yelling over to Luba... TWB 2. \nRAYA (UKRAINIAN) I have to get home. Mama's gonna kill me. \nLUBA (UKRAINIAN) No, you're staying with me tonight. Roman wants us there at 9 in the morning. \nRaya looks at Luba. Torn. \nLUBA (CONT'D) It's just a few months working in a hotel. You want to work at Copyshack like your mother? Marry one of these assholes? There's nothing here!.. He said it was both of us or no go! \nRaya sighs, wanting to, but unable to agree. Luba hesitates; she needs this so badly. \nLUBA (CONT'D) Fuck your mom! \nBut Raya shakes her head, eyes apologetic. She pushes past Luba who watches her disappear. \n3   INT. RAYA'S APARTMENT - KYIV - LATE NIGHT                       3 \nRaya tiptoes through a modest apartment when.... The lights come on. Raya turns back to see HALYNA, 35. Her face torn between anger and relief. \nRAYA (UKRAINIAN) I know I'm late. I tried to leave, but-- \nHALYNA (UKRAINIAN) It's three in the morning. \nHalyna shakes her head, disappointed. Then turns off the lights. Raya stands alone as Halyna goes into her bedroom. SLAM. Raya looks around the apartment, it's poverty, it's measly aspirations... \n4   EXT. KYIV - MORNING                                             4 \nThe silver mist of dawn rises over the Golden Domes of Kyiv. \n5   INT. APARTMENT - KYIV - MORNING                                 5 \nRaya sits on a stool before a WHITE WALL. Luba smokes a cigarette. ROMAN, 40, smiley, fixes a camera to a tripod. \nROMAN (UKRAINIAN) Big smile! TWB 3. \nLuba reads a SWISS HOTEL BROCHURE, then looks up. \nLUBA (UKRAINIAN) (practicing) I am Natalya Verbova. I am going to Budapest to buy carpets for re- selling. I am staying two days... \nRaya sees ZENIA, 30, peeking in the door. Raya smiles. Zenia, nods, demure. Roman looks through the camera. \nLUBA (CONT'D) No-one's gonna believe we really did it! \nLuba beams at Raya, who can't hide her own excitement. \nCAMERA POV: Raya looks into the camera. Her face lights up with hope... FLASH... The IMAGE FREEZES... We BURN TO WHITE. Then the title of the film fades in... \n\"THE WHISTLEBLOWER\" \nA FLASHLIGHT cuts across... \n6   EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - LINCOLN, NEBRASKA - NIGHT                   6 \nAT THE BAR \nKathy moves to Todd and the Americans, catching Todd's eye, but is distracted by a WAITRESS writhing on an ITALIAN SOLDIER's lap. The Waitress darts Kathy a look, contemptuous. And the soldiers notice. One leers at Kathy... \nITALIAN SOLDIER I'd pay double for a woman in uniform. \nKathy looks him over. \nKATHY Sorry pal, I'm not for sale. \nThe Soldier is stung. The Italians laugh. \nTODD MYERS (O.S.) We're Dyncorp. We're all for sale... Kathy, right? \nTodd puts his arm around Kathy, bringing her to a TABLE OF AMERICAN IPTF. They greet her, friendly. \nTODD MYERS (CONT'D) Look the basic lay of the land is we have to work with the other nationals, but we don't mix with them at night. \nJIM HIGGINS, 25, and even younger looking... \nJIM HIGGINS Lucky those wops don't carry guns or we'd've had ourselves a situation. Fucking unarmed mission. I was hoping we'd get to squeeze some off. \nTODD MYERS At who? Better odds you'll step on a land mine and what the hell's a gun gonna do for you then? \nJIM HIGGINS (embarrassed) I'd kill the fucker who buried it. \nEveryone laughs. Todd turns to Kathy. TWB 13. \nTODD MYERS You ever had to take someone down? \nKATHY Just once. \nThe others see she's the real deal. Kathy feels good. \n23   INT. PATIO BAR - LATE NIGHT                                   23 \nKathy moves through the now-hopping bar. She's ready to leave. She searches for... Carmen. She's IN A CORNER. Still with the group of DUTCH OFFICERS. \nKathy approaches, concerned, when Jan cuts her off. He's watching Carmen, who's teetering, drunk. \nJAN You should probably get her home. \nKATHY You probably shouldn't have let her drink that much. \nKathy moves past him, irritated. But he grabs her. \nJAN Hey. I... don't worry. I know those guys. Nothing was going to happen to her. \nKathy shrugs, it doesn't mean much to her. \nJAN (CONT'D) I was hoping you'd come back. \nKATHY Well I did. And now we're both leaving. \n24   EXT. SARAJEVO - MORNING                                       24 \nEarly sun breaks through the fog over the valley. \n25   INT. DORM - KITCHEN - MORNING                                 25 \nKathy tries to work the Bosnian coffee maker, a confusing relic. Carmen comes in, holding her head. \nCARMEN What the hell happened last night? \nKathy smiles, pouring her a cup of the tar-like brew. They both look at it, a little scared. Kathy eyes the clock. TWB 14. \nKATHY Let's move. We're gonna be late. \n26   EXT. STREET - ILIDZA, BOSNIA - DAY                             26 \nIndustrial plants dominate the skyline of this Sarajevo suburb. Kathy drives frantically past bombed-out buildings. Carmen studies a map beside her. They hit A RED LIGHT. And stop. A GROUP OF MUSLIM WOMEN cross the street. One questions Kathy with a lingering gaze. Carmen stares at her map... \nCARMEN Do you have any idea where we are? \nKathy shakes her head. No idea. \n27   INT. ILIDZA STATION - MOMENTS LATER                            27 \nA run-down prefab office, with dated 80s equipment. A couple of small offices off the open center. \nKathy and Carmen rush in. An IPTF OFFICER stands waiting for them... Jan Van Der Velde. \nJAN Late night ladies? \nThey eye him, embarrassed. He hands them each a thick binder. \nJAN (CONT'D) I'm your duty officer. You check the duty roster. Every day. You're each assigned to monitor and instruct a group of Bosnian local police. We work in six week shifts. You instruct in the mornings, then go into the field with them in the afternoon. One of you needs to go now. \nHe eyes an eager Kathy. Carmen shrugs. \nJAN (CONT'D) They're waiting at the 5th canton. Out the gate, then left, left, park, right... \nKathy rushes off, then stops. Jan tosses a set of keys. \nJAN (CONT'D) My van. There's a map in front. \nNo answer. Clarkson looks to Kathy to take control. She turns to her group, but they have even less respect for her. She goes to speak, when... VIKO, 25, looks up, hesitant. TWB 18. \nVIKO (BROKEN ENGLISH) I will take it. \nThe cops turn. Clarkson unclicks his pen. Viko sees Kathy, hungry for support. But Danik scoffs. \nDANIK (BOSNIAK) (At Zlata) Tze ye yiyiy vuna. \nZlata's face tightens. Viko turns to Danik, angry.... Kathy looks to Clarkson, who gives her nothing. \nKATHY What did he say? \nVIKO She is Muslim. He said she deserved it. \nCLARKSON Alright, that's it. Everyone out. \nKATHY (at Clarkson) Isn't she filing a complaint? \nThe other cops eye Kathy, defiant. This is our turf. \nClarkson ushers the cops out. Kathy catches Viko's eye. Simpatico. Then follows the other out. Kathy looks back at Zlata, who lies helpless. \n33   INT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER                       33 \nClarkson leads the group. Kathy pushes up toward him. \nKATHY She has to file a complaint. A woman gets stabbed in the face and there are no repercussions? \nClarkson pulls Kathy aside. Viko stares. \nCLARKSON Quit it! You hear me? \nKathy reddens. The local cops look over. \nCLARKSON (CONT'D) We are not investigators. We are monitors. You don't know a Serb from a Croat or a Bosniak. You've got ethnic hatreds that started a war. This isn't just policing, it's diplomacy. TWB 19. \nKathy blushes, feeling like a chastened schoolgirl. \nCLARKSON (CONT'D) We don't run the show, we make sure the show runs smoothly. \n34   INT. BEDROOM - IPTF DORM - EVENING                             34 \nKathy sits up in bed reading from her Dyncorp/UN manual. She flicks, not finding what she's looking for. Carmen comes out of her room, dolled up for the evening. \nCARMEN Come out. You can't solve this tonight. I'm not taking no for an answer. \n35   EXT. LOCAL CAFE - SARAJEVO MARKET - NIGHT                      35 \nKathy has dinner with Carmen, who talks away. Kathy watches the world go by. She notices an OLDER, LARGE IPTF MONITOR walking with his arm around a YOUNG GIRL, 16, dressed in a short skirt. Kathy turns back to Carmen who is still talking. \n36   EXT. SARAJEVO - MORNING                                        36 \nChanting echoes from the SINANOVA HOUSE of the Dervish Order. \n37   INT. ILIDZA STATION - MORNING                                  37 \nViko comes in, scanning over IPTF MONITORS. Spotting Kathy. \n38   INT. ILIDZA STATION - MOMENTS LATER                            38 \nViko lays down a pile of files. Zlata's picture on top. \nVIKO Zlata Sehik has been to the hospital eight time because of her husband. Every time she try to file a complaint, my bosses send her back. They always laugh at the woman... They laughed at my mother. They do not make prosecutions of domestic violence. I want to get enough evidence to do this. \nKathy isn't sure. She looks around, almost guiltily... \nVIKO (CONT'D) This is why you are here, no? \nKathy looks at him, struck by the truth of this. She takes the files, flipping through them. Thinking... TWB 20. \nKATHY With no police reports?.. Maybe, if you go back to the hospital... You can pull the records for every one of her visits. \n39   INT. FILE ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAY                               39 \nA HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR, who hands Viko a stack of files. \n40   EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                           40 \nKathy sits in a UN SUV. Viko watches as she goes through Zlata's hospital files. She's encouraged. \nKATHY Okay, now get the same thing from all the doctors who treated her. They will have to testify on Zlata's behalf. \n41   INT. LAW LIBRARY - EVENING                                    41 \nViko and Kathy sit behind a pile of Legal Books. Viko shows Kathy a page, a questioning look on his face. \nKATHY This is good. Let's cross reference each injury with other cases where felony assaults were ruled. Can you get something like that? \nViko turns to see a LIBRARIAN at the main desk. \nKATHY (CONT'D) ... Because if stabbing someone in a bar is illegal then the same standard can be applied to a domestic assault. \n42   INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY                                         42 \nViko sits behind Zlata and COUNSEL while a JUDGE rules. \nMember nations' flags slap in the wind. Hundreds of UN SUVs. Kathy drives up. She takes in the huge building. Almost in disbelief that she's part of it, at the center of it all. TWB 24. \n50   INT. LOBBY - UNMHQ - MORNING                                   50 \nThe modern lobby buzzes with UN OFFICIALS and DIPLOMATS. Kathy follows RICK JONES, 30s, athletic, crisp. \nRICK JONES I'm glad to have an American in the mix. You'll be reporting to me. \nKATHY Oh... I, I thought I was reporting to Madeleine Rees' Office. \nRICK JONES It's a joint office. She's Human Rights. But you're Police Task Force. So you go through me. But we all report to Bill Hynes anyhow. \nThey walk through two large doors into... The Inner Sanctum. \n51   INT. CORRIDOR - UNMHQ - CONTINUOUS                             51 \nRick and Kathy round a corner to a medium-sized office, boxes everywhere. Rick eyes the... mess. \nRICK JONES Yeah, your ah... predecessor's files... We're waiting for Archives to get those out of here. I'll put another call in. \nKathy nods, taking in the disarray. Dust sits on the stacks of boxes, on papers and files strewn about. \nKATHY It's fine. Thanks for the tour. \nRICK JONES Great. I'll leave you to it. Good luck. \nHe leaves her. Kathy runs her eye over the place. The reality of her office less exalted than she imagined. But she's raring to go. She eyes a name plate: \nKATHRYN BOLKOVAC - HEAD OF GENDER AFFAIRS. \nKathy stands in her office doorway, glancing up the hall. \nTHE HALL is empty. The EXIT door at the end swings shut in the flickering fluorescent light. TWB 25. \n52   EXT. OLD TOWN TURKISH QUARTER - SARAJEVO - NIGHT               52 \nBlack cobbles. Merchants line the narrow pathways. Open- doored cafes serve coffee to UNEMPLOYED YOUTH. Kathy and Jan walk along. He's delighted. She's restrained. \nJAN I was wondering when you'd ask me out. \nKATHY It's not a date... No, seriously. It's not. I know you had a lot to do with my promotion, so I wanted to thank you. \nHe grabs her by the hand, ducking into a SMALL ARCHWAY. A NARROW PASSAGE opens up onto a charming restaurant. \n53   EXT. CAFE - OLD TOWN - LATER                                   53 \nKathy and Jan sit at a table, watching a WAITRESS put down a carraffe of wine and 'Cevapcici' (lamb dish). \nJAN Here's to not dating. \nKATHY Listen to me. I'm not joking around. You're a nice guy. But I... \nThe waitress reaches across Kathy with a plate. Winks at Jan. \nWAITRESS You are certain you have everything you need? \nThe waitress eyes him coyly. Kathy studies the exchange. \nJAN We're fine thank you. \nThe waitress leaves. Kathy shakes her head, amused. \nJAN (CONT'D) You were saying I'm a nice guy-- \nKathy is watching the waitress hit up another table. \nKATHY You must be in heaven over here. \nJAN The war left behind a lot of widows. TWB 26. \nKATHY You don't find that-- \nJAN I find it uncomfortable. A lot of guys don't. I don't know what else to say about it. Now finish your sentence, I'm a nice guy but-- \nKATHY I can't afford to mess this up. \nJAN It's only dinner. How bad can it get? \nKATHY Ask my two ex-husbands. \nHe grins. Kathy looks at him, unsettled by the chemistry between them. \n54   INT. CORRIDOR - UNMHQ - DAY                                   54 \nRick introduces Kathy to various IPTF and UN colleagues. \n55   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                             55 \nKathy stacks unpacked boxes out of the way. She organizes a BIG BULLETIN BOARD into 12 CANTONS. \n56   EXT. EIGHTH CANTON - AFTERNOON                                56 \nKathy follows an IPTF monitor, BARRY, 30s, Irish past the front of a UN BUS. A DOZEN MUSLIM WOMEN disembark and look up, their hands over their mouths, keening. \nBARRY This is the first time they've seen their homes in years. \nKATHY What's going on here? \nLOCAL COP (SERBIAN) Xo brovnic ce klety scey forzcic nay. \nHe moves past her, with the Girls in tow. \nKATHY Hold on. Where are the IPTF monitoring this raid? \nSHOUTING ECHOES from inside the bar. TWO COPS drag out TANJO ZRAVBIC, 50s. He sees Kathy's uniform and SHOUTS at her. \nTANJO (SERBIAN) Zra slobovik brvicetic revic barziny Traba! Motherfockers! \nThe cops SHOVE Tanjo in a car, and SLAM the door. Kathy turns to the Local Cop, standing with the group of girls. \nKATHY Is that the owner? Are you taking him into custody? TWB 30. \nLOCAL COP Xivy slovic drinjnislava porslivky. \nKathy looks around, frustrated. \nKATHY Is there a translator on the scene? Translator?... Wait. \nHe stops, impatient. Kathy pulls out her WALKIE. \nKATHY (CONT'D) This is Kathy Bolkovac. I need an Interpreter. At the Florida Bar. \nThe Local Cops watch her. Kathy's eyes rest on the girls. \nWALKIE VOICE (O.S.) (ACCENTED ENGLISH) Okay. I need a time and date. \nKATHY Now. \nWALKIE VOICE (O.S.) That's impossible. We need advance notice for field calls. \nThe Local Cop talks at the girls. They don't understand him, but his tone is clear: total disrespect. Kathy moves toward them, protectively, then sees... \nTWO UN SUVs parked on the other side of the bar. \nTWO IPTF MONITORS emerge from the bar. Kathy approaches them. They seem surprised. \nKATHY Hey. I'm from Gender Affairs. I-- \nFRED MURRAY Hey. Fred Murray. \nHe shakes her hand. \nTanjo BANGS on the window, inside the police car, apopleptic with rage. Kathy glances over her shoulder. \nKATHY Is that the owner? (off Fred's nod) I tried to get an interpreter but-- \nFRED MURRAY No, no... that's fine. We're pretty much done here anyway. TWB 31. \nKATHY Oh... Okay. But there's... We just had two girls come in to a Human Rights Office, saying they escaped from this place. \nFred seems confused. Kathy pulls out a clipboard. \nFRED MURRAY Yeah. Local police have been watching the place for a while. This whole thing happened pretty fast. I guess those girls must've run for it. \nKathy looks over as the girls are put into a van. \nKATHY Well, the girls in our field office seemed pretty scared. I should follow up with these ones. \nThe Local Cops start to move, stubbing out cigarettes, getting in cars. The Local Cop shuts the doors of the van. \nFRED MURRAY You can see where they're taking them, but I can't intervene. You know the drill. \nHe shrugs and smiles. Kathy hears the POLICE VAN's engine start. Turning to it... \nKATHY Thanks. I'll look out for your report. \nShe rushes after the van. Fred eyes Kathy confer with the Van driver. He and the other Monitor, drive off. \nKathy is left alone in the silence. She turns to the bar. \n60   INT. FLORIDA BAR - MOMENTS LATER                             60 \nKathy moves inside. The place is rank and dingy. A small stage with a POLE in the centre. Tables fanned out around it. CUT WIRES hang over the stage. \nTHE BAR AREA \nIs filled with PHOTOS: YOUNG GIRLS in various poses with men, IPTF SOLDIERS. They range from the illicit to the obscene. \nKATHY Jesus... TWB 32. \nKathy stops on a photo of a NAKED GIRL on stage holding the two open wires over her head. Behind her, SOLDIERS applaud. \nKathy takes down the photo, horrified. Turns it over. Scrawled in marker: SARAJEVO FIRECRACKER! \nShe turns to the stage. Plugs in one of the wires. A HUZZ of electricity. Tiny sparks fly. \nShe turns, and under the bar sees... A SAFE, SMASHED OPEN. A handful of U.S. bills scattered about. And... \nPASSPORTS. Romanian, Ukrainian, Polish. All for young girls. She gathers them, surprised, and stuffs them into her file. \nHer eyes are drawn to a back wall. She stops at a panelled door. And pushes. It opens onto... \nCARMEN Hey, where've you been? \nKATHY I'll tell you about it over a drink. Could you just check something for me? I want to get a copy of the monitor's report from a raid on the Florida Bar yesterday. \nCarmen nods, and clicks on her computer. \nCARMEN Your job is so exciting. The only thing I get to raid is the fridge. (Reading off the computer)... You sure there was a raid? There's no record here. \nKATHY No. That's definitely it. There were six girls removed from the bar and I need to know where they were taken. TWB 36. \nCARMEN Sorry. No record of any raid. \nKathy thinking. Something's not adding up. \n66   INT. CORRIDOR/OFFICE - UNMHQ - MORNING                         66 \nKathy walks. MONITORS greet her as she passes. She reaches an OFFICE, and knocks. \nKATHY I'm looking for Fred Murray? \n67   EXT. MINE FIELD - BOSNIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                    67 \nFIVE local MEN in fatigues scan the field slowly with hand- held minesweepers. One MAN holds up his hand as his device BEEPS. At the edge of the field, Fred Murray blows a whistle. Everybody else STOPS. The man bends down, as all wait... \nKathy approaches from the road, behind a fence. Fred smiles. \nFRED MURRAY We meet again! \nKathy looks out, suddenly aware of the dangerous situation. \nKATHY Is it okay for me to be here? \nFRED MURRAY Sure, sure. You're fine here on the gravel. What's going on? \nKATHY I just wanted to follow up with you on the raid yesterday. Those girls didn't show up at the Shelter, and I wanted to locate them. \nFRED MURRAY Yeah, the whole thing was a bit of a mess. Turned out it was a local police mistake. Mix-up with the tip off or something. Thought they had a prostitution bust, but the bar is legit and those girls were just waitresses. \nKATHY Waitresses aren't kept under lock and key. \nANOTHER WHISTLE BLOWS. Fred turns to the field. TWB 37. \nFRED MURRAY Shit. Can we go over this later? I got to get in there. \nBefore she can answer, Fred is moving down the field. She watches him go. \n68   EXT. WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - DAY                              68 \nKathy and Milena lead Raya and Irka out to her SUV. \n69   EXT. GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT AGENCY - DAY                          69 \nA stark contrast, the GDA is a new and shining edifice. Kathy's SUV pulls up front. \n70   INT. GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT AGENCY - MOMENTS LATER                70 \nKathy and the girls sit in the waiting area. The place is modern, western... corporate. In platinum base relief over the reception desk: \nGLOBAL DISPLACEMENT AGENCY. \nThe LOBBY. Magazines on a coffee table. The wall adorned with a HUGE FRAMED POSTER of a young girl in a spiderweb. A caption: \"TRAFFIKU ZHINOK YE SPRAV. 1999\" \nKathy scans the hall. Endless posters. 1998, 1997, 1996... \nLAURA LEVIN, 30s, American, groomed, business-like, comes around the corner. Her ASSISTANT, 20s, leads the girls away. \nKATHY Kathy. The new Head of Gender Affairs. \nLAURA LEVIN I heard. Laura Levin. My assistant will take them to the medical center. As soon as they get medical clearance we'll know where we stand. \nKATHY What do you mean? \nLAURA LEVIN Well, it's yet to be determined if they'll cooperate with the repatriation program. That's the only way I can allow them to stay at the GDA. TWB 38. \nKATHY They're critical... witnesses for a situation I'm... monitoring. I'll need to speak with them when they're ready. \nLAURA LEVIN I understand. I'll be in touch. \nKATHY Will you be contacting their parents? \nLaura nods. Something still on Kathy's mind... \nKATHY (CONT'D) The other girls from the raid were supposed to go to the Women's Medica Shelter, but they never showed up. Do you have any idea where else they might have been taken? \nLAURA LEVIN I didn't know there were any others. \nKathy eyes the girls down the hall. Raya turns, a last look. \n71   INT./EXT. UN SUV/GDA - NIGHT                                   71 \nKathy starts her car. She pulls out, turning left. Then, cranks the wheel right. \n72   EXT. ROAD - NIGHT                                              72 \nKathy's UN SUV swerves along the serpentine mountain road. \nA DOCTOR signs off on a final examination of a now much healthier looking Raya. He smiles. She signs a form. \n84   INT. LAURA'S OFFICE - GDA BOSNIA - DAY                         84 \nLaura hovers in the background as Raya dials the phone. Her face raw with emotion. \nINTERCUT WITH: \n85   INT. RAYA'S APARTMENT - KYIV - SAME                            85 \nThe phone in the hall rings. But no one is there to answer. \n86   INT. ROMAN AND ZENIA'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON                   86 \nHalyna at the door. Zenia pales. O.S. A kettle whistles. \nZENIA (UKRAINIAN) Roman will be home soon. \nHALYNA (UKRAINIAN) Make your tea. I'll be quick. \nKITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nZenia pours tea out of a chrome kettle. Her hands shake. Halyna stares at a new dishwasher. Then a microwave, blender and small LCD TV. Suspiciously out of context in Kyiv. \nHALYNA (UKRAINIAN) (CONT'D) Roman seems to be doing well. \nZENIA (UKRAINIAN) Milk? TWB 42. \nHALYNA I need to borrow money. \nZenia looks up, unsure. \nHALYNA (CONT'D) They found Raya in Sarajevo. I want to go and get her. I don't need much. \nZenia nods, keeping still as possible. \nHALYNA (CONT'D) Does he still hit you? \nZenia chokes on her tea. Conflicted between love and guilt. She wants so badly to say... but she can't. \nHALYNA (CONT'D) You know I hate to ask. But she's my daughter... and your niece. Please-- \nZENIA I'll get you the money... But you have to go. Roman will be home soon. He won't give it to me if he knows it's for you. \n87   INT. RICK JONES' OFFICE - MORNING                             87 \nKathy watches Rick flip through her report. \nKATHY Fred Murray. There were other officers too. But the raid was not in the books. These girls were just sent back. They are clearly not waitresses. They are victims. I think IPTF were paid off to turn a blind eye. \nRICK JONES That's a serious allegation. And you don't have any evidence. I can't open an investigation based on a hunch. \nHe drops the papers. \nRICK JONES (CONT'D) You're gonna need more than this. \n88   INT. GDA BOSNIA - AFTERNOON                                   88 \nRaya and Irka sit across from Laura Levin. She slides a document over to each of them. TWB 43. \nLAURA LEVIN (RUSSIAN) If you sign here, you confirm that you are voluntarily entering the repatriation program at the GDA. \nRaya eyes Irka, confused. Laura softens slightly... \nLAURA LEVIN (CONT'D) This means we can get you out of Bosnia. Isn't that what you want? \nRaya's eyes widen. Irka is shocked, but joyous. They never thought this moment would come... \nLAURA LEVIN (CONT'D) You'll stay here for two weeks, to continue medical treatment as well as psychological counselling. We'll give you a ticket home and a stipend of $200 to get started when you return. \nSuddenly Irka's face drops. \nIRKA (RUSSIAN) But... What do I do then? My parents were killed in Kosovo. It was my brother who sold me here... Can't I go somewhere else? \nLaura fumbles. \nLAURA LEVIN We can only send you home, but what you choose to do after that is up to you. \nBut now, angry tears well in Raya's eyes. She looks up, torn. \nRAYA (RUSSIAN) What about the others, the girls in the bar. My friend Luba, we ran, she couldn't... I don't know where she is... I can't go without her. Please... \nLaura pauses, taken aback. \nLAURA LEVIN I'm sorry, but my role here is to get you home. Otherwise you stay in Bosnia, where you... could face charges for illegal prostitution. \nRaya stares, reeling... To be made to feel like a criminal? TWB 44. \nIRKA I will sign. \nRaya looks at her, but Irka doesn't look back. \n89   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - SHORT TIME LATER                 89 \nKathy stares out across the central courtyard. Into the adjoining building. Through the glass, she watches... \nNadia lifts up her sweatshirt, revealing a long scar. \nKathy inspects the photo: Nadia with a SOUTH AMERICAN and U.S. IPTF: Their arms around her. One licks her face. \nNADIA (CONT'D) They burn me. Then they laugh. \nKathy eyes Nadia... Silently in awe of her strength. \nKATHY Do you have any more pictures? \n93   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                             93 \nKathy pins Nadia's photo on a large bulletin board. Steps back. The wall is covered in photos of girls. \nKathy reaches for the phone. Dials. \nERIN (O.S.) ...Hello? \nKATHY Erin. What are you doing? TWB 48. \nERIN (O.S.) It's three in the morning, ma... I'm sleeping. \nKathy sits back, relieved. \nERIN (O.S.) (CONT'D) Mom, are you okay? \nKATHY Yeah. I just was thinking about you. \nERIN Okay, can I go back to bed now? \nKATHY Yeah. Of course, I just... It's great to hear your voice. \n94   INT. RICK JONES' OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                       94 \nKathy stands before Rick's desk. He smiles at her, convivial. \nRICK JONES How're things? \nKATHY Busy. I followed up on the Florida Bar. It's worse than I thought. There was a protection racket. IPTF... Americans, Romanians, were taking pay-offs to make sure the place wasn't busted. That raid was a punishment bust, because the owner stopped paying. But he must've settled it because the girls are right back where they started. Locked up in the hills. \nRick scrambles for words, but Kathy's not finished. \nKATHY (CONT'D) I talked to thirty five girls at the Shelter. All this testimony can't be ignored. Our guys are patronizing the bars in large numbers. Rick, serious abuses are taking place. It's all in my reports. \nKathy lays her stack of files on the desk. \nRICK JONES Okay, let's back up a second here-- TWB 49. \nKATHY I've got two girls ready to testify about IPTF taking pay-offs-- \nRICK JONES Testify where? \nKATHY In court. \nRICK JONES A Bosnian court? Not gonna happen. All International Personnel have immunity. \nKathy is stopped. \nKATHY I know. But there must be some channel, some exception-- \nRICK JONES Look, you've done really good work here. These are serious allegations. Let me look into how to handle it. I'll get back to you. \n95   EXT. OLD TOWN - SARAJEVO - EVENING                             95 \nThe markets shut down. The Catholic Church Bells ring. Across the square the Call to Prayer echoes from old loudspeakers`. \n96   INT. KITCHEN - KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                       96 \nJan stirs a pan. Kathy awkwardly cuts vegetables beside him. \nJAN It's different for us. We're all military or police. Every contingent except for the U.S... if someone does something wrong, they have to answer to a military tribunal at home. With the Americans... your Dyncorp guys? I don't think you have that. \nKATHY So the Americans aren't legally accountable for anything? \nJAN To be honest, I think our superiors would keep it quiet too. I mean, I haven't seen a military tribunal. TWB 50. \nJan can't help noticing that Kathy is making a mess of the vegetables. He takes the knife. She walks away, preoccupied. \nJAN (CONT'D) You know my mission stay is up in a few weeks... You could come home with me. \nKATHY To do what? \nShe turns, glass of wine in hand, leaning on the counter. \nJAN I was just... This place, y'know, it gets to you. I'm, I'm worried what will happen to you a year from now. \nShe puts down her glass of wine, irritated. \nKATHY You don't need to worry about me. \nJAN Someone does. \nShe looks at him, seeing... It's not discouragement. It's love. \nKATHY So Fred Murray could just walk up to a man and shoot him in daylight and he'd never see the inside of a courtroom? \nLAURA LEVIN I was going to call you. There was a problem. During our repatriation procedures, we realized Irka had no passport. \nKATHY So we get her one. Where is she? \nLAURA LEVIN You don't get it. She was trafficked from Belgrade. Her parents were killed in Kosovo. And she has no documentation. No embassy will recognize her. She is a girl without a country. \nKATHY She is a witness for a UN investigation! \nGDA EMPLOYEES peer. An INTERN betrays a twinge of complicity. \nLAURA LEVIN We handed her over to the police a few hours ago. I couldn't keep her. I've already done every favour I could for you. This is not on me. \nKATHY You had no right to do that! \nLAURA LEVIN I had every right. We have a system that works here. You're the one disrupting it. \nKathy stares at her. Fuming. \nKATHY Where did they take her? \nLaura shrugs. Shaking off guilt has become a necessary habit. \nJust then the door opens. And... TWB 54. \nHALYNA \nWalks in. Disoriented, emotion rising... \nHALYNA (BROKEN ENGLISH) I... look for Laura Levin? \nLAURA LEVIN (RUSSIAN) That's me. \nKathy holds her anger, smiling respectfully at Halyna. Laura leads her away. Kathy searches for an answer, her eyes landing on... The Intern. Unrelenting... \nKATHY If you know anything, this is on you. \nINTERN I think the cops leave them somewhere near the border, so that with no papers, the girls have to cross the border illegally. Take the 103 to Visegrad. \n105   INT./EXT. UN SUV - NIGHT                                      105 \nKathy. Speeding down the 103. A two-lane winding road. Seeing...

UN SUV - SAME                                       108 \nKathy's eyes GLUED on the road, trying to make out a SIGN... \nLANDMINES. Then another sign... VISEGRAD PRAVO. \nSharp Turn. Onto a GRAVEL ROAD. She brakes. SKIDDING. \n109   INT. POLICE VAN / EXT. SARAJEVO - SAME                        109 \nViko stops at a traffic light. Raya peers out a crack in the van. Seeing...

She approaches... \nA BORDER STATION: A GRAVEL ROAD leads up to it. Kathy slows. \nBORDER GUARDS smoke and play cards. One guard saunters over. \nKATHY I'm looking for a girl. She was dropped here a few hours ago. \nHe shrugs, shaking his head. \nKATHY (CONT'D) Can you check the border logs? She's about 15, the police brought her here but she didn't have a passport. Maybe-- \nGUARD Lady. I know what you're looking for. Those girls do not go through the border. They go through there... \nHe points... A THICK Forest. Stretching for MILES. \nGUARD (CONT'D) To Serbia. \nKathy stares at the endless forest. A dirt road cuts through the middle. She jumps in her SUV, and HURTLES down the road. \n111   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          111 \nViko turns down a narrow street. He glances in his rear view mirror. An old TRABBANT follows him. He veers down an alley. \n112   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           112 \nKathy's SUV crawls alongside the FOREST. HIGHBEAMS off the top of the car. SCANNING all around. Then, in a clearing up ahead... \nKATHY I also think the American embassy should be aware of some of the problems we're having with our officers. \nMadeleine interjects... \nMADELEINE Your help with Irka's case can really raise awareness in the Mission around the issue of trafficking. \nMadeleine gives her a reassuring glance. Kathy sees the difference between a cop and a diplomat. \n139   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - NIGHT                        139 \nKathy stands. Still in her dress, going through files. Proud of the night's accomplishments, but her eyes linger on the board of girls... On the picture of Raya's APB. TWB 64. \n140   EXT. BOSNIAN COUNTRYSIDE - EARLY MORNING                      140 \nSun over the hills. A DOG follows a YOUNG BOY, 5, through a field. The boy stops, seeing a BROWN VAN down the road. \nHe runs, waving as the van approaches. It slows to meet him. In the van... Ivan rolls down the window. \nBOY (SERBIAN) Can I come with you? \nIVAN (SERBIAN) Not today. \nThe boy looks down, disappointed. \nIVAN (CONT'D) Tell your mother I'll be home for dinner. Then you and I will go for a walk. I have a present for you. \nBOY What is it? \nIvan shrugs jokingly. Then smiles as he drives away. \n141   EXT. BOMBED OUT BUILDING - BOSNIAN COUNTRY HOUSE - MORNING    141 \nThe brown van pulls up. Ivan comes around it, and opens the back door. He reaches in and pulls out... AN OLD BICYCLE. \nTANJO (SERBIAN) You couldn't buy him a new one? You have money now. \nIVAN (SERBIAN) I'll fix this one up this afternoon. I had one like it. \nTanjo lights a cigarette, moving to the destroyed building. \nTANJO They're downstairs. I want to get them out today. \n142   INT. STAIRWELL - BOMBED OUT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER          142 \nIvan follows Tanjo down rickety steps. CRIES AND WHIMPERS GROW LOUDER as they descend into a \nBASEMENT \nTWO MEN stand guard. Tanjo walks past them. Opens a door. Ushering Ivan INSIDE where... TWB 65. \nGIRLS are huddled together. Luba, and THREE OTHERS. They look up... PETRIFIED... Offscreen, the cries swell. \nWe realize the sound IS NOT COMING FROM THIS ROOM. Tanjo waves his fingers, methodically... \nTANJO (RUSSIAN) C'mon, let's go. \nThe girls stand, helping one another. Tentative but submissive, they move toward him. He holds open the door. \nTANJO (CONT'D) I want to show you what happens when YOU DECIDE TO TALK TO COPS!!!! \nThey jump back. His scream echoes. They move \nTHROUGH THE HALL \nTo a door on the other side. Tanjo nods. A guard opens the door onto A HORRIFIC SITE... Luba closes her eyes. But Tanjo pushes the girls in, one by one they go through into a \nBARREN ROOM \nAnd see... Raya... NAKED. HELD DOWN BY FOUR MEN. SPREAD EAGLE ON HER FRONT. WAILING. HER FACE SHOWS UNIMAGINABLE PAIN. And we see that... \nTwo of the men holding her down are EXTINGUISHING LIT CIGARETTES INTO THE BALLS OF HER FOOT. \nRAYA Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!! \nBut we realize... this is not the greatest cause of her pain. \nLuba's face whitens. Eyeing one MAN at Raya's backside. A flash of shame in his eyes as he steps away from Raya, and drops... A PIPE onto the ground. \nThe men step away. Leaving Raya. Collapsed into a ball. Now the girls all understand... there is no hope at all. \n143   EXT. CONFERENCE ROOM - UNHCR - DAY                            143 \nMadeleine stands before a small group of REPORTERS. \nMADELEINE The young woman, who shall remain anonymous, arrived in Bosnia as a victim of sex trafficking and has survived horrific abuse. (MORE) TWB 66. \nMADELEINE (CONT'D) Ordinarily she would be repatriated to her country of origin. But because she is an orphan, she finds herself without a home. I'm pleased to announce that we have found a foster family in the United States. I want to thank Janet Wells for her assistance in making this happen. I believe this can stand as a signal that the International community in Bosnia and beyond is finally ready to recognize the growing epidemic of sex trafficking, a human rights abuse as abhorrent as the war crimes that drew the International Community to intervene in Bosnia in the first place. Thank you. \nREPORTER Now that the UN is finally recognizing sex-trafficking, how are you going to monitor it? \nReporters flock with questions. Kathy stands in the back, proud. On the other side, Rick Jones watches. \n144   EXT. FRONT STEPS - UNHCR - SHORT TIME LATER                   144 \nKathy and Madeleine emerge, buzzing with their success. \nKathy sits at the table, covered in photos of girls, flipping through the Dyncorp manual, irritated. \nKATHY Consolidate my leave... A fucking vacation? \nShe shakes her head, overwrought. Flipping through the manual, seeing... \nKATHY (CONT'D) Who are these people? (stopping on a page) And why does Dyncorp, a company that sends American peacekeepers, have it's corporate headquarters in England? \nShe looks up at Jan. He shrugs, sympathetic, wanting to help. \nKATHY (CONT'D) Of course I want to see my kids, of course. But... not like this. Not by being sent home like some hysterical woman... My God, it wasn't that easy to up and leave them. If I go home like this... It's like coming here, this whole thing was a... mistake. TWB 70. \nShe shakes her head, lost in thought... Maybe it was... Jan sits beside her, concerned. \nJAN Nobody who knows you could think that. \nKATHY Really? I'm losing witnesses, suspects... It's one step forward, two steps back... \nJan tries to jump in. But-- \nKATHY (CONT'D) No, seriously. I'm just a cop from Nebraska. What do I know? \nJan shakes his head. \nJAN It's not what. It's who. You know them. \nHe points at the files and photos of girls splayed all over the table. Kathy eyes them, torn between self-doubt and something much more instinctive... \n151   INT. LAURA LEVIN'S OFFICE - GDA BOSNIA - EVENING              151 \nLaura sits across from Halyna, who is heartbroken. \nLAURA (RUSSIAN) Mrs. Kochan... It's been a few weeks now. I don't know if there's much point-- \nHALYNA (RUSSIAN) But we-- I must-- I have to do something. There has to be something I can do?! \nLaura takes a second. Suddenly struck with an idea. \n152   EXT. OASIS BAR - MORNING                                      152 \nA large WOOD HOUSE with a neon CAMEL sits in the mountains above the city of TUZLA.

FIVE GIRLS wake in cots on the ground. He motions for them to go in. They do. TWB 71. \nMARA, 19, hands Raya and Luba a piece of paper with CRUDE DRAWINGS of SEXUAL POSITIONS. A price value by each. \nMARA (RUSSIAN) You work in two hours. \nIvan and Mara leave, locking the door behind him. \nThe other girls go about their business, barely noticing Raya and Luba. But JULIA and TANYA, 16, come over. \nJULIA (RUSSIAN) You sleep on whichever mattresses are available. The last two girls in have to share. \nTANYA (RUSSIAN) They bring us food in the morning. You have to eat it all, or you get fined. \nRaya grabs her head. Feeling faint. She looks for a place to sit. Julia and Tanya help her to the ground. \nJULIA Don't let him see you like this. \nLuba walks over to the other side of the room. Finds a spot and sits. Raya watches her, hurt. Julia pushes a mattress aside. Underneath is a... COUNTING SYSTEM scratched into the floor. Each girls' name scratched with numbers beside it. \nJULIA (CONT'D) I'm the closest. Then I can go home. \nRaya barely has the energy to hold herself up. \nTANYA What's your name? \nRAYA (UKRAINIAN) Rayisa...Raya Kochan. \nTanya scratches Raya's name into the floor. Then one mark. \nLUBA (RUSSIAN) It's all bullshit-- \nJULIA No! He sent a girl back three months ago. I was here! (to Luba) What is your name? \nRaya eyes Luba who's conflicted between loyalty to her friend and her own sense of survival. Luba tears up, but turns away. TWB 72. \nRAYA (softly) Her name is Luba. Luba Pankiw. \n154   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - MORNING                         154 \nKathy works, angry, urgent now. On her desk... \nCLOSER: REPORT: PHOTO ID LINE-UP. Kathy matches circled ID photos of IPTF alongside testimony and Polaroids of girls. \nShe works fast. Circling the photos, slapping files closed.

LONG CORRIDOR - UNMHQ - MORNING                       159 \nKathy, reports in hand, turns a corner, and... bumps into an OFFICER. She drops some files.

OFFICE - INTERNAL AFFAIRS - UNHMQ - MORNING           160 \nKathy marches in, nervous... MONITORS turn and see her, knowing who she is, but trying not to show it. She approaches a MALE MONITOR at a desk in the front. \nMALE MONITOR What can I do for you? \nThe Monitor keeps typing as she talks. Kathy hesitates, then \nKATHY It's, I need to speak in-camera with a senior IA official. I don't have a name, but-- \nKathy recognizes Peter Ward working in a back OFFICE. He sees her, then closes the door. \nMALE MONITOR Just a moment please. \n161   INT. CLOSED OFFICE - INTERNAL AFFAIRS - UNMHQ - DAY        161 \nKathy sits across from an IA OFFICIAL, 50s.

Some of them were marked as referred to IA. \nOFFICIAL I haven't seen those. \nKATHY Really? \nHe shakes his head, standing. \nOFFICIAL It's possible they're still in the pipeline, in preliminary processing. I'm sorry to have to rush this, but I have to get to a meeting.

Peter smokes furiously, a burned-out mission lifer, who's bright, intelligent eyes betray a last spark of the idealism that brought him into this world. He seems nervous. \nKATHY That was you today, in IA? \nPETER WARD (nodding) Would you like a drink? \nKathy eyes him, dubious. He pours her a drink. \nPETER WARD (CONT'D) I saw your files... \nKathy nods. Peter slaps down a file. Kathy looks at it. \nKATHY What's this? \nPETER WARD Your file. \nKATHY I don't understand. \nPETER WARD They're investigating you. \nKathy stares at him. \nPETER WARD (CONT'D) Don't you get it?

You'll get us in trouble. \nAn IPTF OFFICER, MIKE SEARS grabs Raya from behind. Shakes her, jokingly. She laughs, familiar. Almost routine.. \nMIKE SEARS How's my favorite girl? \nRAYA I am good. Everything good. \nShe smiles, hollow and takes the tray over to a TABLE. Julia and Tanya sit with FOUR MEN in suits. They're plastered. \nSUIT 1 (GERMAN ACCENT) I wanna party all night. \nThe girls smile, nodding, playing along... \nSUIT 2 (AMERICAN) Let's go out. I wanna take you home. \nHe squeezes Tanya tight to him, kissing her sloppily. \nSUIT 2 (CONT'D) Ivan! C'mere! \nRaya eyes Julia. Ivan comes over, smiling, a gregarious host. \nSUIT 2 (CONT'D) We wanna party on mate. How much to take them home for the day? \nIvan eyes the girls. Thinking... TWB 83. \nIVAN Ten times normal. Pay upfront. And extra deposit. But you cannot take her. \nHe points at Raya. \nIVAN (CONT'D) Three thousand each. (off their scoffing) You bring back, you get back deposit. \nIvan smiles. The other two men are dubious. But Suit 1 and Suit 2 exchange glances... Daring each other. \nSUIT 1 You're on. \nIvan waves to follow him. They walk with Julia and Tanya. Raya watches Ivan throw in a bottle of whiskey. They pay him. \nJulia catches Raya's eye. They exchange... A look of promise. \n181   EXT. BUS DEPOT - MORNING                                     181 \nKathy brings Julia and Tanya in. An Intern leads them down the hall. Viko comes in... \nVIKO Should I call for a raid? TWB 86. \nKATHY No. He'll walk. We have no proof they were trafficked. Let me talk to them. See what else they know. \n190   INT. OFFICE - GDA BOSNIA - SHORT TIME LATER                  190 \nLaura watches video footage on a TV. Halyna appears on the monitor. Her assistant PAUSES it. \nASSISTANT That's their first cut. I'll pass on your notes, and they should have it ready for the grant proposal in time. \nA KNOCK at the door. \n191   INT. LOBBY - GDA BOSNIA - MOMENTS LATER                      191 \nKathy stands, curt now with Laura. All business. \nKATHY I have no options right now. The GDA is more secure than Milena's shelter... Can they stay before you do the paperwork? \nLAURA LEVIN They'll go on record? \nKathy nods. Laura shrugs in assent. \n192   INT. KITCHEN - GDA BOSNIA - LATER                            192 \nKathy listens to a tearful Julia. \nJULIA (BROKEN ENGLISH) Ivan is good friends with the soldiers. They come all the time. \nKATHY And you're saying these soldiers brought you into Bosnia. Through the border? You're sure? \nJULIA Yes. In a van. White van. Like yours. \nThey both nod. Emphatic. Kathy thinks... \nKATHY They had uniforms? Like mine? \nThe girls nod again. Absolutely sure. TWB 87. \nJULIA April 8. I never forget. The day I leave my home. We come to Bosnia some day later. I know because we stop at the border. We were six of us. Men from the border, they opened the doors... We give them our fake passports. My name was Irena Woycek. I thought they would see the fake passports, I thought... \nShe hesitates, the memories flooding back... \nJULIA (CONT'D) I thought they would save us. \n193   EXT. GDA BOSNIA - DAY                                        193 \nViko follows Kathy out. \nVIKO If there are records showing those girls came through the border with IPTF-- \nKATHY Then you have conspiracy to traffick. And I can take it to Bill Hynes. That's enough to do a raid that will stick. \nVIKO The main border station keeps the logs. \nKathy heads to her SUV. Viko shakes his head -- points at an old TRABBANT (a life-size matchbox car). \n194   INT./ EXT. TRABANT - NIGHT                                   194 \nThe ride is bumpy. Viko shouts over the engine... \nVIKO Best if it looks like a local matter. Get more info. You be my UN monitor, okay? \nKathy smiles, cramped, but appreciative of his help. \n195   EXT. BORDER POLICE STATION - NIGHT                           195 \nViko talks to a BORDER COP sitting at an ancient Mac Computer. Kathy notices a calendar of Pamela Anderson frolicking in foamy surf. \nVIKO So when a vehicle is stopped, you'll keep all this on file here? TWB 88. \nBORDER COP Of course! It's our fucking job! \nVIKO And other stations up the border send all their files to you? \nBORDER COP Some do, some don't. Fifty-fifty chance. \nDisappointing. Viko lights a smoke, offers one to the cop. \nBORDER COP (CONT'D) You say 30 minutes outside Sarajevo? Maybe Visegrad? You might be lucky. Lanky guy in their archives loves to send files. \nKathy looks hopefully at Viko, who shrugs. Clicking... \nBORDER COP (CONT'D) Okay, 11th... (mumbling) ... No, no. You like?.. Big exciting to watch Bosnian police do boring things? \nKathy smiles. He turns back, clicking. Then stops. \nBORDER COP (CONT'D) You owe me! UN vehicle with 6 girls in back. Stanley Harris. \nHe turns proudly to them. \nBORDER COP (CONT'D) What you think? All his little sisters come to visit from America? \nViko looks knowingly at Kathy. \nBARMAN Fuck you! \nKathy eyes the girls. Their confusion, their fear... \nDanik, hesitates, confronted with the vulnerability of these girls... His face softens. He looks to Kathy for direction. \nKATHY You do not have to be afraid of Ivan Bladzic. He cannot hurt you now. TWB 92. \nBut the GIRLS don't move... \nKathy looks out -- Stunned -- Because she sees... \nRaya. Standing. Shocked. No idea who to trust anymore. One last shred left of the dream of escape... \nKathy goes to her. But Raya's eyes dart to... Luba. \nThen to Kathy, recognizing the last kind face she saw... \nBARMAN (BROKEN ENGLISH) These girls work here. They have all documents, passports! You can fuck off. \nTwo local cops GRAB him. Danik CUFFS him. \nThe girls are astounded. Viko holds up passports. \nVIKO Fakes. Bad ones. \nThe barman is dragged outside. Kathy scans the girls. Ending on Raya... her faith awakening. \nKATHY We want to get you out of here safely. That is my absolute priority. \nThe girls exchange a flurry of looks, speaking volumes... Should we trust her? Can we risk it? \nKATHY (CONT'D) (To Viko) Get those blankets out of the vans. Let's get these girls out. \nBut the girls still don't move... Raya. Fractured with despair... After all she has been through, all the punishment, all the pain... \nRaya holds Luba's gaze - Maybe even she could be convinced... \nAnd Raya starts to step to Kathy... When... \nBehind Kathy, an IPTF officer removes his helmet. Mike Sears. He stares at Raya. Petrifying her. \nKathy sees it in her -- WHIPS around. Mike Sears avoids her gaze. Kathy turns back to Raya. Moving closer, quietly, out of earshot of the others... TWB 93. \nKATHY (CONT'D) You just have to tell me you want to go. That you do not work here voluntarily. And we will get you to safety. \nRaya wants so badly to answer. \nKATHY (CONT'D) You can leave with me this second. All of you can. But I need you to say it. \nRaya eyes Mike Sears - He looks to Luba. Luba turns back to Raya - Pleading -- Don't do it. \nKATHY (CONT'D) You know me. \nRaya can't look at Kathy. Tears stream down her face. \nKATHY (CONT'D) You can all leave with me! (to Raya) Let's go. \nRaya. With her heart breaking... \nRAYA No. \nKathy looks at the all girls. Their eyes flitting between Mike and Kathy... And she understands... \nKathy REELS around. Grabs Mike by the collar -- SHOVING him to the door -- SLAMMING him against the wall. \nKATHY Who the fuck are you? What have you done? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? You fuck! \nMike pushes back... \nMIKE Get off me, you crazy bitch! \nKATHY They're supposed to TRUST US! \nViko and Danik pull them apart. \nVIKO C'mon Kathy. It's over. TWB 94. \nShe steps back -- Catching her breath -- Shaking her head -- NOT AGAIN... She looks at Raya, tears streaming down her terrified face... \nKATHY I know this girl. I know her. We can't leave them here. We're supposed to-- \nVIKO If they won't come, we can't force them. Nothing will hold up in court. They'll be returned and punished... Do you want blood on your hands? \nThe girls all return to their positions behind the bar, cleaning, sitting around the edges... Not one will catch... \nKathy's eye. She glares at Mike Sears. \nKathy watches across the room, devastated... \nAs Raya turns, giving up her last chance to leave, and exits to a back room. \n206   EXT. OASIS BAR - NIGHT                                        206 \nKathy paces frantically in the darkness. Eyes wild. \nKathy stares at her computer... She presses NEW MESSAGE. \nCLOSE ON A BLANK EMAIL, THE \"TO\" LINE IS EMPTY. \nKathy types. We see the following addresses: \"UN CHIEF OF STAFF\", \"HIGH COMMISSIONER BOSNIA\", \"UN SECRETARY\"... \nShe continues typing. CLOSE ON THE SUBJECT LINE: \nDO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE A WEAK STOMACH OR GUILTY CONSCIENCE \nKathy pours her heart into the keyboard. As she types... \nKATHY (V.O.) I am a police officer obligated to report crimes. I have taken statements from women describing their physical, psychological, and emotional torture... \n215   INT. OASIS BAR - BACK ROOM - LATE NIGHT                       215 \nThe girls sleep. Raya lies awake crying. \nKATHY (V.O.) ...On arriving in Bosnia these women are sold, and forced to provide sexual services... \n216   EXT. BORDER STATION - NIGHT                                   216 \nAn IPTF VAN stops. The window rolls down: It's Mike Sears. TWB 98. \nKATHY (V.O.) ...Their clientele consists of SFOR, IPTF, local police, and International employees. Worse, they have become involved in the trade itself. \n217   EXT. HALYNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                              217 \nHalyna sits at an empty table. Her face gaunt from worry. \nKATHY (V.O.) ...It is time each and every one of you realize this is a serious organized crime, with enormous profits. \n218   INT. LOCAL POLICE STATION - NIGHT                            218 \nThe Oasis Barman dumps a STACK of DOLLARS on the counter. Fills out a form. Ivan Bladzic is released by a COP. \nKATHY (V.O.) You are peace keepers who came to protect the innocent but now prey upon them in the worst ways possible... \n219   INT. MARKET - NIGHT                                          219 \nLines of YOUNG GIRLS. A BUYER approaches one of them. She closes her eyes, too tired to fight. \nKATHY It is time to face the truth of what is happening. We can right our wrongs, and move forward, ashamed, but accountable and transparent... \n220   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                               220 \nKathy finishes typing... \nKATHY (V.O.) We may be accused of thinking with our hearts instead of our heads, but we will have our integrity. \nWe pull back as she sits in front of the computer. Nothing but the screen illuminating her face... \n221   INT. BACK BEDROOM - OASIS BAR - MORNING                      221 \nThe girls can't sleep. THE DOOR OPENS. Luba comes in, quickly closing the door behind her. She rushes to Raya. TWB 99. \nLUBA (UKRAINIAN) He's coming back in the morning. He's furious. Convinced you will talk. \nThe other girls rally around, supportive. Raya shakes. Luba looks into her eyes, suddenly melting. \nRAYA (UKRAINIAN) But I didn't say anything. I won't say anything. I didn't... (SOBBING) \nLuba holds her tight. Their friendship not buried after all. Luba unlocks a window, and gives her some money. \nLUBA He's gonna kill you. Go! Go! \nRaya's eyes widen. Terrified. She jumps out into the unknown. \n222   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - MORNING                              222 \nKathy buttons up her uniform. Logging into her email... \nMAILBOX FULL \nIn the INBOX: EMAIL after EMAIL. All with the same subject: \nRE: DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE A WEAK STOMACH OR GUILTY CONSCIENCE \n223   INT. BILL HYNES' OFFICE - UN MISSION HEADQUARTERS - DAY       223 \nBlakely, Rick and JOHN MORGAN, 50s, State Department, stands behind a FUMING Bill Hynes. He throws down Kathy's email. \nBILL HYNES What is this? \nKATHY An email I wrote. \nBill suppresses his anger. He holds out his hand... Blakely hands him a document. Bill places it before Kathy. \nBILL HYNES The actions I am taking are for your own benefit. We are seeking your repatriation back to the United States. \nKATHY (stunned) You can't-- \nBILL HYNES I'm doing this for your own good. TWB 100. \nKathy eyes him, her gaze shifting to Morgan. \nShe turns. Peter stands over her. Eyeing the tape recorder. \nPETER WARD (CONT'D) Scrambling devices. \nShe looks at him, waiting for his next move. His eyes soften. \nPETER WARD (CONT'D) It probably won't work in most of the rooms. Now c'mon. Get out of here. \nShe smiles, silently thanking him. She shoves the recorder in her pocket. Grabs the bag. Thrown by it's heaviness. Peter helps her get it on her shoulder. \nHe ushers her out. Locking the door behind them. They move \nDOWN THE HALL \nWhen Rick Jones barrels after them. Waving Kathy's appeal. IPTF OFFICERS come out of their office. Kathy rushes into \nTHE ELEVATOR \nQuickly looking around THE METAL PANELING. She drops the bag. An ECHO REVERBERATES through the HOLLOW SHAFT. Kathy turns... TWB 109. \nAgain slipping her hand in her pocket. This time determined. \nRICK JONES I'm gonna tell you this in front of him and everybody else, you no longer have a UN ID. You no longer have a UN job. You do not have a job with the Department of State. The Department of State holds your contract. They are the ones who are pulling it. You will not have an appeal.

I don't want to make accusations about those girls. But I will assert over and over again, I run a ZERO TOLERANCE program for that type of activity... \n248   INT. FRANZ' HOUSE - DAY                                     248 \nKathy watches footage of Bill Hynes on BBC. She stares in disbelief. Then picks up... THE GYM BAG FULL OF FILES.

BASARABSKA MARKET - DAY                                  252 \nKathy moves through TOURISTS browsing for jewelry. Holding the gym bag tight. She turns a corner down a \nSIDE STREET \n240   Narrow.

Now I really won't see you for a while. \nKATHY I'm doing this for us. If I have a better job, I can give you guys more. \nErin nods, tearing again. \nERIN When do you have to decide? \nKATHY Come here. \nErin moves over, hesitant. Kathy pulls her in to a hug, wincing slightly in pain. But keeps a brave face. TWB 7. \nERIN Are you sure it's not dangerous? \nKATHY Of course. It's been four years. Things are getting back to normal over there. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nA BOMBED OUT building, sprayed with RED GRAFFITI. DEBRIS everywhere. Torn clothes. A SIGN.

A SOLDIER looks out from the HATCH. \nKathy turns to see the only other woman on the bus, Carmen, 20s, Latina. She smiles cheekily, giving Kathy the `peace' sign. Kathy smiles. IMMEDIATE SOLIDARITY. \nIn the opposite direction, two other UN BUSES pass, one flanked by a CANADIAN FLAG, the other with a FRENCH TRICOLOR. \nThe bus cranks around the corner, entering... \n12   EXT. SNIPER ALLEY - CONTINUOUS                                12 \nThe final stretch into Sarajevo. Famous from so many war reports, site of many deaths. The broad, pock-marked avenue is barren. SHELLED HIGH RISES lean like hungry faces, gouged from their once-solid structures. Living rooms are exposed to the elements, wallpaper blowing in the wind like torn skin. TWB 8. \nIN THE BUS: Carmen taps Kathy, pointing out the window... \nCARMEN Sniper Alley. See, the bullet marks are at eye level. People just running to the store. \nAll the walls are splattered at head level. Kathy is overcome by the stark reality of war.

Kathy extends a parcel to an OLD MAN. He hesitates. Then she sees... He has no arms. She's unsure what to do. A young boy takes the package, leading his grandfather away. Kathy stands: WHERE AM I? \nASSEMBLY HALL: Bill Hynes stands before a map of the Balkans. TWB 9. \nBILL HYNES (CONT'D) The Dayton Peace Accords of 1995 ended this war, dictating that an International Police Task Force - YOU - would smooth the transition from war to peace. \n15   EXT.

As Head of the United Nations Mission here I trust that we stake our highest values, even our lives, on the belief that we can rebuild, we must renew, we will witness the rebirth of this country. \nThe recruits are hyped, the rhetoric is working. MOVING OVER THEM, MAN by MAN, we REVEAL in the back: \nKathy. In her crisp navy blue IPTF flack jacket. Her blonde hair makes her stand out. She is one of the only women in the room. Her eyes ablaze.

Carmen heads toward one, when an AMERICAN IPTF MONITOR stops her. \nAMERICAN IPTF That's a military Bar. You want the party in there... \nHe points to BIG NEON SIGN: THE INTERNATIONAL BAR. Tiki lights illuminate a broad patio. A PIG roasts on a spit. \nKathy follows Carmen through DOZENS of off-duty IPTF, SFOR and UN workers who drink and trade stories with machismo. \nThere's a palpable sexual tension in the air. BOSNIAN WAITRESSES flirt with OFFICERS. Guys paw GIRLS with trays. \nCARMEN Fuck me, we're outnumbered. Good odds. \nKATHY Hon, they're all yours. \nThey make their way through the crowded bar, feeling the officers' double-takes. Carmen smiles coyly at Kathy, then zeroes in on JAN VAN DER VELDE, 35, handsome. He is surrounded by a group of IPTF with Dutch flags on their shoulders. Carmen throws her arms around them, jovial. \nCARMEN Okay, fine, if you insist. Mine's a Jaegermeister. \nJan laughs at Carmen's forwardness, his eye on Kathy. But she spots Todd Myers across the bar, and is on her way, when... \nJAN What about you? You don't have an order? \nKATHY No. I'm the polite one. \nJAN I like polite. \nCarmen turns his head toward her. TWB 12. \nCARMEN I'm gonna be the drunk one. Let's get toasted. \nKathy smiles, a little too old for this game. Carmen leans into Kathy's ear. She smiles, and moves off. \n", "test1_id": 1224, "test2_input": "They step inside, and IN ONE GLANCE, see... THE WHOLE SET OF GIRLS is different. No Luba, No Raya, No Tanjo...

Sitting. Terrified. \nHALYNA (RUSSIAN) ...How could? No, no, no... my, Raya.... What!? What will they do to her? \n129   EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT                                    129 \nA BROWN VAN snakes through the distant mountain roads. \n130   INT.

Tanjo cranes into the back of the van. He turns on an overhead light, revealing... \nFive girls. Huddled in the back. \nTANJO (RUSSIAN) (CONT'D) So you want to testify? \nAll the girls turn to... Raya. Their conscience paralyzed by the need to survive. Terrified, Raya looks to... Luba. Her eyes pleading for support. But Luba turns away. TWB 59. \nTANJO (CONT'D) It's okay. We all move to a new bar now. Somewhere no one will come look for you. Then we have a conversation. \nThe girls avoid Raya's gaze. She sobs. Tanjo turns off the light. The van drives off into the unknown. \n131   EXT. PARKING LOT - BACK ENTRANCE - UNMHQ - MORNING            131 \nKathy stands by her SUV, watching MONITORS set off for the day. Then she sees... \nFred Murray emerge with COLLEAGUES, laughing. He stops when \nHe sees Kathy, gazing over, serious. \n132   EXT. PARKING LOT - UNMHQ- DAY                                 132 \nKathy and Fred walk between the parked cars. \nKATHY She's fifteen. I'm begging you-- \nFRED MURRAY I don't know what you're talking about. \nKATHY If you know any of the other bars he owns, anything... I'm appealing to-- \nFRED MURRAY Hey. I'm gonna say this one more time. And you can put this down in your investigation on me. I don't know what you're talking about. \nHe leaves.

RICK JONES OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                          133 \nRick's SECRETARY shakes her head at Kathy. \nSECRETARY I've called and paged.

MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - MORNING                        134 \nMADELEINE It's not your fault. \nKathy is downcast. She nods, not totally convinced. \nKATHY Irka won't testify now. It's completely understandable. She's way too scared. I just... I don't know what to do with her. The GDA won't take her and her traffickers will find her if she's in this city. \nEmotion taking over... \nKATHY (CONT'D) These girls are dragged into this country like cattle and then the system that's supposed to help them spits them right back out. It barely recognizes sex trafficking as a problem even though it's a fucking epidemic, and everyone knows it. Are we supposed to wait around for that to change? \nMADELEINE Maybe it's time for a little diplomacy... Do you have a nice frock? \n135   INT. KATHY'S APARMENT - NIGHT                                135 \nKathy stands in front of a mirror, in a black dress, her hair hanging down to her shoulders. She stands, awkward. \nKATHY Really? You think it's okay? \nShe turns to Jan and Carmen, sitting on her bed. Jan smiles. \nJAN You're beautiful. \n", "test2_true": "CARMEN You can stop standing like a farmer's wife for starters. These people are dignitaries. You gotta up your game. \nShe approaches her, and sweeps her hair up into an elegant chignon. She takes off her own earrings and puts them on Kathy. Jan nods, impressed.

Madeleine is elegant in a suit. Kathy looks at her black dress, self-conscious. \nKATHY Is there a specific way of addressing the High Commissioner of the Mission? \nMADELEINE I call him Bill. \nKathy nods, nervous. They pull into a circular drive... \n137   EXT. U.S. AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - SHORT TIME LATER           137 \nThe house is incongruous in its context: Manicured gardens, remodelled facade. And tonight its BLACK TIE and CATERING. \nAn elegant WOMAN comes to greet them. She is... \nMADELEINE (familiar) Mrs. Ambassador! How do we do? \nJANET WELLS We do what we can. Great to see you Madeleine. \nJanet smiles with the delicatesse of a diplomatic spouse. \nMADELEINE I hope you don't mind, I've brought along a friend. This is Kathy Bolkovac. \nKathy holds out her hand, a little nervous. \nJANET WELLS Great. I need as many gal pals as I can get. Look at this place. \nShe gestures toward the room. A haze of cigar smoke hovers over the gaggle of men. Kathy's eyes zero in on \nBill Hynes \nSurrounded by a group of JAPANESE DIPLOMATS. Bill notices her and Madeleine. He waves, familiar. Madeleine nods, humoring. \nAMBASSADOR JOHN WELLS, 40s, slides his hand on Janet's back. \nAMBASSADOR WELLS What are your thoughts on dinner? TWB 62. \nJANET WELLS I think people are still busy drinking. \nJohn shakes Madeleine's hand, darting his eyes over Kathy. \nAMBASSADOR WELLS Speaking of, what can I get you ladies? \nMadeleine looks at Kathy. \nKATHY Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. Ah, I'll have a wine please. \nAMBASSADOR WELLS (nodding) Coming right up. Madeleine, white for you? \nKathy notices the respect he shows her. Janet leads them in, chatting with Madeleine. Kathy surveys the room full of dignitaries. \n138   EXT. BACK PATIO - U.S. AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT         138 \nA stunning view of Sarajevo at night. Kathy stands alone. A waiter offers her a convoluted hors d'oeuvre. She takes it, gracious. Trying to figure out what it is when... \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Nice view, no? \nKathy turns to... PETER WARD, 40s, smoking a cigarette. \nKATHY Oh I... I just needed some air. \nPETER WARD Trust me, I know the feeling. I hate these stuffy events. You never know anyone's agenda. \nHe eyes her. She looks past him... At Bill Hynes. Peter sees. \nPETER WARD (CONT'D) Oh... well that's a plan. \nMADELEINE (O.S.) Actually, I had a different one in mind. \nMadeleine and Janet come through the door. Peter stubs out his cigarette, and moves back inside. TWB 63. \nMADELEINE (CONT'D) (arm around Janet) Behind every good man... \nPATIO - SHORT TIME LATER \nJanet's eyes betray empathy. She shakes her head, upset. \nJANET WELLS They just left her there? At the border? Poor girl... Just the psychological trauma. How can I help? \nKATHY She's very vulnerable to re-trafficking. Internationals got her in this situation. We owe her the chance to get out. \nJanet is keen to follow, but a little lost. \nMADELEINE We want to repatriate Irka to the United States and find her a foster family. I was hoping you could use your influence-- \nJanet holds up her hand, nodding emphatically. \nJANET WELLS We're going to find her a home. \nKathy eyes Madeleine. Impressed. \n", "test2_id": 1225, "test3_input": "Reaching it, Kathy looks through the EYEHOLE... And exhales. She opens the door to... Madeleine Rees. \n231   FRANZ'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                                 231 \nKathy listens, anxious as Madeleine lays it out... TWB 103. \nMADELEINE It's bollocks. Absolute and total. You have signed a contract with Dyncorp Aerospace Operations U.K... And there is no provision under English law for summary dismissal without due process or an investigation. \nMadeleine stops... seeing Kathy is overwhelmed. \nMADELEINE (CONT'D) But there was something else Bill said... If this is coming from above... Kathy,you need to prove that they are dismissing you because you were uncovering wide- spread corruption within this mission. If you can prove that this is indeed coming from Washington, that the State Department is instructing Dyncorp to fire you. Then we're talking about a conspiracy. \nKATHY They tell me... people disappear. They bug my house. I mean, I'm sitting here, worried there's a bomb in my car-- \nMADELEINE We can fight this. \nKATHY This isn't just my career, it's my life. I don't know if I'm ready to be a scapegoat. \nMADELEINE That's exactly what you are. \nKATHY Whose? \nShe eyes Madeleine, pointed. Madeleine sits back. \nMADELEINE I don't know what to say to that.

The girls wake. \nIvan. He picks Raya up by the neck. She fights. Luba runs in. \nRAYA (RUSSIAN) I didn't say anything. I never will. Why are you doing this? I just want to go home. I want to see... Mama... Mama... \nBut he kicks Raya in the stomach. She ROARS in pain. He flips her over. Shaking her. He looks to the other girls. FURIOUS. \nIVAN (RUSSIAN) This all happened because of you. \nHe pulls out a gun. Raya looks to Luba for help. But it's too late. Ivan presses the gun to Raya's head. \nHe glares into Raya's eyes. A flash of ire. \nRaya reaches again... Luba steps forward, when... BANG!!!! \n217   Raya's body falls. Luba turns away. She cups her hand over    217 her mouth.

Your email was the bravest thing anyone's even done in this mission. \nKathy nods, truly appreciating that. She walks away, her silhouette growing smaller and smaller down the hall. \nThe secretary takes Kathy's letter. Walking into \nBILL HYNES' OFFICE \nBill paces around Rick Jones, Ambassador Wells and John Morgan. Hynes grabs Kathy's letter. \nMORGAN Get something on her! Get anything! \n238   INT.

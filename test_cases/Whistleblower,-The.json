Kathy follows RICK JONES, 30s, athletic, crisp. \nRICK JONES I'm glad to have an American in the mix. You'll be reporting to me. \nKATHY Oh... I, I thought I was reporting to Madeleine Rees' Office. \nRICK JONES It's a joint office. She's Human Rights. But you're Police Task Force. So you go through me. But we all report to Bill Hynes anyhow. \nThey walk through two large doors into... The Inner Sanctum. \n51   INT. CORRIDOR - UNMHQ - CONTINUOUS                             51 \nRick and Kathy round a corner to a medium-sized office, boxes everywhere. Rick eyes the... mess. \nRICK JONES Yeah, your ah... predecessor's files... We're waiting for Archives to get those out of here. I'll put another call in. \nKathy nods, taking in the disarray. Dust sits on the stacks of boxes, on papers and files strewn about. \nKATHY It's fine. Thanks for the tour. \nRICK JONES Great. I'll leave you to it. Good luck. \nHe leaves her. Kathy runs her eye over the place. The reality of her office less exalted than she imagined. But she's raring to go. She eyes a name plate: \nKATHRYN BOLKOVAC - HEAD OF GENDER AFFAIRS. \nKathy stands in her office doorway, glancing up the hall. \nTHE HALL is empty. The EXIT door at the end swings shut in the flickering fluorescent light. TWB 25. \n52   EXT. OLD TOWN TURKISH QUARTER - SARAJEVO - NIGHT               52 \nBlack cobbles. Merchants line the narrow pathways. Open- doored cafes serve coffee to UNEMPLOYED YOUTH. Kathy and Jan walk along. He's delighted. She's restrained. \nJAN I was wondering when you'd ask me out. \nKATHY It's not a date... No, seriously. It's not. I know you had a lot to do with my promotion, so I wanted to thank you. \nHe grabs her by the hand, ducking into a SMALL ARCHWAY. A NARROW PASSAGE opens up onto a charming restaurant. \n53   EXT.

I'm not joking around. You're a nice guy. But I... \nThe waitress reaches across Kathy with a plate. Winks at Jan. \nWAITRESS You are certain you have everything you need? \nThe waitress eyes him coyly. Kathy studies the exchange. \nJAN We're fine thank you. \nThe waitress leaves. Kathy shakes her head, amused. \nJAN (CONT'D) You were saying I'm a nice guy-- \nKathy is watching the waitress hit up another table. \nKATHY You must be in heaven over here. \nJAN The war left behind a lot of widows.

The women enter the building, their past lives in shards at their feet. One WOMAN, 40s, stands numb, a bundle of books in her arms, tears running down her face, as her TEENAGE SON beckons her to come in the DOOR. \nKATHY Except us. \nBARRY I always thought helping refugees get home would be one of the best parts of the job. But it's so hard for them. \nKathy nods, moved. \nKATHY Thanks for taking me through this. Fill me in when you're done, and I'll send my report to Rick Jones. \nAnother FIELD OFFICER rushes up. An urgent look on his face. \n57   INT. IPTF FIELD OFFICE - AFTERNOON                             57 \nThe field officer leads Barry and Kathy round a corner, to... \nA YOUNG GIRL nearly passed out on the couch. Her face bloody and swollen. Kathy runs up to the girl, who can barely sit up. Softly waking her. The girl comes to, taking in her surroundings, and... \nJUMPS UP. An unmistakable look in her eyes. TERROR. \nKathy eyes the field worker. He shrugs, lost. Kathy turns back to the girl, and slowly places a hand on her shoulder. The girl flinches, then inches back... shaking her head. \nKATHY It's okay, it's-- \nBut the girl holds out her hands, stopping Kathy. She looks around, completely disoriented. Desperately searching for an exit. She eyes them all, realizing she's surrounded and then... SHE WAILS. \nLosing control. Slapping at all of them. Kathy moves to her, trying -- gently -- to hold her tight. The girl sobs. Hopelessness in her eyes. And then... TWB 28. \nShe faints. Kathy and Barry bend to catch her. \nKATHY (CONT'D) (at field worker) Call a medic! \nHe rushes off. Kathy and Barry lay the girl down. She lies on the ground, breathing slowly, looking close to death. \nKathy holds her hand. \nKATHY (CONT'D) Who is she? \nFIELD WORKER I found her out in the woods. She was speaking, I don't know, she's not local. I think she's one of the girls from the bars. \nLooking at the girl, Kathy pushes a strand of hair from her face. And as we stay a moment longer, we realize this is... \nRaya. A long way from home. But then... \nTHE DOORS OPEN. A frantic HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER carries IRKA, 17, into the room. Her clothes torn, her body and face bruised. Kathy looks up... \nHUMAN RIGHTS WORKER She was further back in the woods. \nIrka sees Raya. Sudden relief. Then realizing... \nIRKA (ENGLISH/RUSSIAN) Florida Bar... Ciysh... Six girl there... Iy Policai... \nKathy looks to Barry. \nBARRY It's a bar in the hills. \nKathy shakes her head. She looks at Raya and Irka. \nBARRY (CONT'D) I'll take them to the women's shelter at Zenica. \nKathy rummages through her files, catching up. \nKATHY Yeah. Good. I'll follow up at the bar. \nBarry shrugs. Kathy's mind is racing.

A LOCAL POLICE CAR swerves by in the opposite direction. \n59   INT. UN SUV/EXT. FLORIDA BAR - DAY                             59 \nKathy's SUV throws up gravel. Out her windscreen, she sees \nTHE FLORIDA BAR: A dilapidated two story building, painted a garish pink. Crude palm trees painted on the side. \nKathy jumps out of her SUV, and moves towards... \nLOCAL POLICE smoke by POLICE CARS. \nA LOCAL COP leads a CLUSTER of YOUNG WOMEN out the door. They blink in the glaring light, pale, out of place, lost... \nAt the end of the line, is Luba. Her eyes darting between Kathy and the Local Cops, helpless. \nKathy rushes towards the cop.

He sees Kathy's uniform and SHOUTS at her. \nTANJO (SERBIAN) Zra slobovik brvicetic revic barziny Traba! Motherfockers! \nThe cops SHOVE Tanjo in a car, and SLAM the door. Kathy turns to the Local Cop, standing with the group of girls. \nKATHY Is that the owner? Are you taking him into custody? TWB 30. \nLOCAL COP Xivy slovic drinjnislava porslivky. \nKathy looks around, frustrated. \nKATHY Is there a translator on the scene? Translator?... Wait. \nHe stops, impatient. Kathy pulls out her WALKIE. \nKATHY (CONT'D) This is Kathy Bolkovac. I need an Interpreter. At the Florida Bar. \nThe Local Cops watch her. Kathy's eyes rest on the girls. \nWALKIE VOICE (O.S.) (ACCENTED ENGLISH) Okay. I need a time and date. \nKATHY Now. \nWALKIE VOICE (O.S.) That's impossible. We need advance notice for field calls. \nThe Local Cop talks at the girls. They don't understand him, but his tone is clear: total disrespect. Kathy moves toward them, protectively, then sees... \nTWO UN SUVs parked on the other side of the bar. \nTWO IPTF MONITORS emerge from the bar. Kathy approaches them. They seem surprised. \nKATHY Hey. I'm from Gender Affairs. I-- \nFRED MURRAY Hey. Fred Murray. \nHe shakes her hand. \nTanjo BANGS on the window, inside the police car, apopleptic with rage. Kathy glances over her shoulder. \nKATHY Is that the owner? (off Fred's nod) I tried to get an interpreter but-- \nFRED MURRAY No, no... that's fine. We're pretty much done here anyway. TWB 31. \nKATHY Oh... Okay. But there's... We just had two girls come in to a Human Rights Office, saying they escaped from this place. \nFred seems confused. Kathy pulls out a clipboard. \nFRED MURRAY Yeah. Local police have been watching the place for a while. This whole thing happened pretty fast. I guess those girls must've run for it. \nKathy looks over as the girls are put into a van. \nKATHY Well, the girls in our field office seemed pretty scared. I should follow up with these ones. \nThe Local Cops start to move, stubbing out cigarettes, getting in cars. The Local Cop shuts the doors of the van. \nFRED MURRAY You can see where they're taking them, but I can't intervene. You know the drill. \nHe shrugs and smiles. Kathy hears the POLICE VAN's engine start. Turning to it... \nKATHY Thanks. I'll look out for your report. \nShe rushes after the van. Fred eyes Kathy confer with the Van driver. He and the other Monitor, drive off. \nKathy is left alone in the silence. She turns to the bar. \n60   INT. FLORIDA BAR - MOMENTS LATER                             60 \nKathy moves inside. The place is rank and dingy. A small stage with a POLE in the centre. Tables fanned out around it. CUT WIRES hang over the stage. \nTHE BAR AREA \nIs filled with PHOTOS: YOUNG GIRLS in various poses with men, IPTF SOLDIERS. They range from the illicit to the obscene. \nKATHY Jesus... TWB 32. \nKathy stops on a photo of a NAKED GIRL on stage holding the two open wires over her head. Behind her, SOLDIERS applaud. \nKathy takes down the photo, horrified. Turns it over. Scrawled in marker: SARAJEVO FIRECRACKER! \nShe turns to the stage. Plugs in one of the wires. A HUZZ of electricity. Tiny sparks fly. \nShe turns, and under the bar sees... A SAFE, SMASHED OPEN. A handful of U.S. bills scattered about. And... \nPASSPORTS. Romanian, Ukrainian, Polish. All for young girls. She gathers them, surprised, and stuffs them into her file. \nHer eyes are drawn to a back wall. She stops at a panelled door. And pushes.

HIDDEN BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             61 \nKathy's flashlight over: Hanging BEDSHEETS separate the room into cubicles. Putrid mattresses. Condoms on the floor. \nHer eye catches MARKINGS UNDER A MATTRESS. She pulls it away. And sees GIRLS' NAMES scratched into the floor... Under each name, etched in, a list of amounts: 50, 100, 30, 200, 20... Some kind of RECORD. \nKathy PULLS back other mattresses. Dust. Some FAMILY PHOTOS. And... a ragged PIECE OF PAPER: Crude drawings of sexual positions. A NUMBER by each one: $20, $30, $50, $100, $200... \nThe amounts correspond exactly with the table on the floor. \nKathy looks around, sickened. \n62   EXT. WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - SARAJEVO SUBURBS - NIGHT         62 \nA run-down Community Center nestled in a shabby area outside the city. It's completely unassuming. From the outside, you might think it was abandoned. TWB 33. \n63   INT. HALLWAY - WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - MOMENTS LATER         63 \nThe shelter is a converted gymnasium. Peeling wallpaper. Long- forgotten notices from before the war, postcards. Patchy linoleum curls at the edges. A soft hum. Voices in rooms that Kathy can't see. She walks down the hall with MILENA, 40s, Bosnian, down-to-earth, forthright. \nMILENA (ACCENTED ENGLISH) These girls are told they have been bought and must repay the debt. They are told an outrageous sum, thinking they'll be let go when they earn back that money. But they never are. \nKathy stares at her, taken aback. \nMILENA (CONT'D) Sex trafficking is one of the worst things to happen after this war. \nMilena hands over a medical report. \nMILENA (CONT'D) Raya has a severe internal infection. The doctor found (reading) \"intentionally placed foreign objects causing a disruption of the vaginal wall\". \nKATHY Foreign objects? \nMILENA Coins. She's not the first. Men can feel deficient paying for sex, so they find other ways to feel powerful. \nMilena pushes through a door. To a DARK HALLWAY... \nHanging bulbs flicker intermittently. They walk. Avoiding dripping leaks in the roof. \nMILENA (CONT'D) We gave her Penicillin, but the doctor is worried there could be something more serious. \nKATHY When will he know? \nThey pass an EATING AREA. TEEN GIRLS sit, pick at food, chain- smoke and flip through magazines. They are clean, but weak. TWB 34. \nMILENA Unfortunately that's all we can do for her. We're just a volunteer organization. \nKathy stares at the girls, the sheer number of them... \nKATHY But if there are so many victims. \nMILENA We lost our funding because of those. \n...She points at a basket of CONDOMS near the coffee. \nMILENA (CONT'D) It's the U.S. Department of State. They have their rules. I'll do anything to give these girls some protection. But the Department of State thinks \"Condoms encourage prostitution.\" NGOs caught giving them out, no longer receive US funding. \nKATHY But these girls aren't prostitutes. \nMilena shrugs. \nMILENA They don't realize the cycle they start. If there are no condoms in the bars... \nThey pass a ROOM DIVIDER. Seeing... MORE GIRLS. IN THEIR TEENS. All broken. And desperate. \nMILENA (CONT'D) ...the guys want to find ways of avoiding STDs. AIDS. Their solution? Pay more for virgins... \nKathy sees A GIRL sit in a corner. She couldn't be more than TEN YEARS OLD. She sits alone. \nMILENA (CONT'D) So the traffickers bring more in. Younger and younger. Now it's a global industry. Simple economics. If there is demand, you supply. \nMilena opens a DOOR, revealing... INSIDE THE ROOM: A VOLUNTEER NURSE sits by Raya's bed. She lies asleep. IN ANOTHER BED: Irka sleeps. Kathy watches. Hushed... TWB 35. \nKATHY Where can they get help? \nMILENA Try the Global Displacement Agency. They have good medical care, lots of funding. They might take them. Whether they'll keep them or not... I don't know. \nKATHY Where are the other girls from the Florida bar? \nMilena looks at her. Blank. \nKATHY (CONT'D) The local police were bringing them here. \nMILENA Those girls never arrived. \n64   EXT.

I didn't... (SOBBING) \nLuba holds her tight. Their friendship not buried after all. Luba unlocks a window, and gives her some money. \nLUBA He's gonna kill you. Go! Go! \nRaya's eyes widen.

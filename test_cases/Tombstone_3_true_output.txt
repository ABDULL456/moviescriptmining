WYATT You'll never make that stick. 
VIRGIL They're carrying guns in town. 
WYATT Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor? 
VIRGIL (pauses, thinking) No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law. 
WYATT (pauses) All right, Virge, your call.  But Give Doc the shotgun.  They'll be Less apt to get nervy if they see Him on the street howitzer. 
Virgil trades the shotgun for Doc's cane.  Doc folds the shotgun under his cloak.  They get set, waiting for Wyatt's cue.  Finally: 
WYATT Well... Come on, boys. 
They start down Allen, footsteps pounding the board sidewalk, Virgil and Wyatt in front, Morgan and Doc in the rear. Bystanders step aside, trading whispers as they pass, turning onto 4th St... 
EXT - LOT BEHIND O.K. CORRAL - DAY 
Behan dashes around the corner into the lot, facing the Cowboys. 
BEHAN They're on their way over here. 
EXT - FREMONT STREET/OK CORRAL - DAY 
The Earps and Doc turn off 4th onto Fremont St. Creek Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion watch as they pass the grocer's. 
JOHNSON There they go.  Look kinda like preachers. 
VERMILLION Yeah.  Or undertakers. 
The vacant lot starts to come into view and the Earps are fighting nerves now.  Fists clenched, gritting their teeth, eyes darting all over the street, they look all too human and nothing like their legend.  It's only Doc, bringing up the rear, who couldn't care less.  Wyatt narrows his eyes: 
WYATT Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head. 
VIRGIL Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'. 
WYATT (sees onlookers) Look at 'em all.  They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this? 
Just then Behan walks up holding up his hands, reassuring: 
BEHAN You don't have to worry about a Thing.  I just went down there and Disarmed them. 
VIRGIL You did?  Great, thanks.  Come on, boys. 
The Earps quicken their step as Behan enters Fly's gallery. Seeing the approaching Earp party, the Cowboys glance around at each other, setting themselves.  Now at the end of the sidealk, the Earps can see that the Cowboys are still armed and their relief evaporates.  Wyatt mutters under his breath: 
WYATT Oh, great.  Disarmed my ass... 
The Earps slow their step, gathering themselves.  This is it, no turning back now.  The Cowboys spread out.  As the Earps get closer and closer, it seems as if the very air is electric with tension.  But as they step into the street and fan out for their final approach, they suddenly do look like their legend, 4 tall figures in long black coats advancing in a line, grim and unstoppable, a fleeting moment in time frozen forever in our minds.  Finally they stop.  The 2 groups are facing each other, perhaps 20 feet apart.  Doc raises the shotgun, the Cheshire cat smile spreading over his face. Virgil steps forward, his face set, holding up Doc's cane: 
VIRGIL We've come to arrest you.  Throw Up your arms! 
A weird moment of confusion where nobody seems to know what to do.  Then Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury SLAP their hands to their guns.  The Earps instantly tense up, hands on their pistols.  Virgil waves his hands frantically, afraid they've misunderstood: 
VIRGIL Hold!  I don't want that! 
Suddenly realizing what's happening, Fuller and Claiborne bolt and dash into Fly's gallery.  Everyone else stands frozen, breath short, pulses pounding, each staring into the other's wide-open eyes.  Then something in Billy Clanton's eyes seems to go dead and Wyatt groans under his breath as the awful realization hits him: 
WYATT Oh, my God... 
Billy and Frank jerk their pistols and the scene EXPLODES, everything happening in SPLIT SECONDS as Wyatt draws and FIRES, knocking Frank down with a gutshot.  Morgan FIRES, blowing Billy back against the wall of the Harwood house.  Tom darts for the cover behind his horse as Ike dives onto Wyatt shrieking like a woman: 
IKE No, no, please!  I don't have a gun! 
WYATT This fight's commenced.  Get to Fightin' or get away! 
Wyatt hurls him aside.  Ike sprints for the gallery.  Tom FIRES over his saddle at Doc who tries for a shot but is blocked by the horse.  Billly bounces back up, howling, and FIRES, the bullet piercing Virgil's calf.  He drops to one knee.  Tom FIRES again.  Doc FIRES one barrel into the air, the BLAST making the horse rear up, exposing Tom for a split second.  Doc FIRES again.  Tom's side EXPLODES into red mist, the full charge of red mist, the full charge of buckshot SLAMMING him into the Harwood house.  Tom drops his gun and teeters into the street, talking eerie little mincing steps, already dead but still moving, like a chicken with its head cut off.  Billy FIRES again, dropping Morgan with a hole in his shoulder. 
MORGAN I'm hit. 
Doc pull his Lightning and FIRES DOUBLE ACTION 1-2-3 times, hitting Billy in the abdomen while Frank bounds back into the fight, FIRING wildly.  Virgil gets up, FIRING BACK.  The whole scene now bathed in thick smoke, the fight starts swirling into the street, each man jockeying for position.  Inside the gallery, Behan and Fuller watch at the window as Ike dives in. He snatches Fuller's pistol and FIRES through the window. Ike's bullets WHIZ past Wyatt's ear.  He spins around, calling to Doc: 
WYATT Behind us! 
In a flashing move taking less than a heartbeat, Doc pivots, replacing the .38 in this right hand with his big .45, then with one pass of his left hand RAPID FIRES quick as a machine gun burst 1-2-3-4-5 times, the bullets RIPPING through the gallery, showering Ike and the rest with splinters and broken glass. 
BEHAN Come on! 
Behan hauls Ike up and they dash out the back door, Fuller and Claiborne right behind, all frantically running for their lives.  Outside Billy gets to his knees, seemingly indestructible, and FIRES at Wyatt,  Wyatt RETURNS FIRE.  Eyes wild and bulging, a bloody hand clutching his wounds, Frank staggers across the lot, bearing down on Doc through the smoke: 
FRANK I got you now, you son of a bitch! 
DOC You're a daisy if you do!

MILES Mm. 
REX But then... But then... 
Quietly. 
MILES Time marches on. Ardor cools. 
REX No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there. 
MILES Ah. 
REX You know what I mean when I say "it." 
MILES Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex. 
REX Seems like there's more of it than ever before -- 
MILES Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described? 
REX I don't know. I can assume... 
MILES Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel? 
REX I'm not sure. 
MILES And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities? 
REX Video. 
MILES Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup? 
Rex hangs his head. 
Miles sighs sympathetically. 
MILES The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible? 
REX That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything. 
MILES Nothing? 
REX I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions. 
MILES So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear? 
REX Well -- is that possible? 
Miles smiles at him. 
EXT. RUNNING PATH - SAN VICENTE BLVD. - MORNING 
Marylin power walks along the San Vicente Bike Path with her friends SARAH SORKIN and RAMONA BARCELONA. It's early, but the path is crowded with bikers, bladers, runners, power walkers, wheelchair racers etc. Ramona pushes her infant in a baby jogger. 
SARAH You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow? 
MARYLIN I didn't know Barry had a beach house. 
SARAH Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name. 
RAMONA (To Marylin) So who'd you hire? 
MARYLIN Ruth Rabino. 
SARAH She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor. 
MARYLIN She did a Harriman. 
SARAH Wow. 
MARYLIN In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass. 
RAMONA I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.

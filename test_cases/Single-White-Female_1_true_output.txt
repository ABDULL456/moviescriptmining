We are across the street from the Rizzoli bookshop, the shop where Hedra is working. 
RIZZOLI BOOKSHOP - INTERIOR DAY 
Hedra, dressed exactly like she was in the previous sequence, is dialing a number on the telephone on the wall. 
A lady comes to her. 
THE LADY CUSTOMER Excuse me, can you tell me where the biography section is ? 
HEDRA Oh, yes, towards the front, against the wall. 
THE LADY CUSTOMER Okay. 
The lady moves away from Hedra. 
We hear Allison's answering machine talking in the telephone. 
ALLISON'S ANSWERING MACHINE (voice over) Hi, this is Allison Jones. Please leave a message. Thank you. 
A beep. 
HEDRA Hi, Allie, it's me. I'm just calling to see if you're okay. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY 
Close up shot on the answering machine. Then the camera moves away from the telephone table and, in the living room, we see Sam and Allison, standing in a close embrace and kissing each other. Some pieces of clothing are already on the floor, and we see Allison's foot stroking the back of Sam's leg. 
HEDRA (voice over on the answering machine) Call me at work. Yeah. Okay. My number's on the fridge. Okay, bye. 
RIZZOLI BOOKSHOP - INTERIOR DAY 
Hedra puts the phone back on its hook. She seems very nervous. 
HOTEL ATHERTON - MAIN ENTRANCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
The Atherton Hotel is evidently a quite luxurious hotel. 
Sam and Allison are walking on the sidewalk towards us and the entrance of the hotel. 
SAM Say... Next month, that would give her enough time. 
ALLISON I don't know. Just got herself on hands. Haste wouldn't do. I'm sure she'll understand. 
They enter the hotel. 
HOTEL ATHERTON - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Sam and Allison cross the lobby, hand in hand. 
An old hotel clerk looks at them from behind his counter.

ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Close-up on the TV set showing a movie featuring James Stewart. 
JAMES STEWART (playing his character in the movie) I have an idea I must be in love with you. Has it hit you that way ? 
Reverse angle shot on Hedra sitting in an armchair, with her bare feet on another armchair. She is eating ice-cream from a large plastic pot. On the floor beside her, the puppy is playing with a tennis shoes. Hedra looks down at it and kicks it away with one of her feet. 
HEDRA Hey ! It's not for you ! 
The puppy goes away yapping. Hedra has a mean look on her face. JAMES STEWART (voice over from the TV set) Would you like it to go on for always ? 
FEMALE CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE (voice over from the TV set) How does anything go on for always ? 
JAMES STEWART (voice over from the TV set) Well, one likes to think some things do. 
Hedra keeps on eating her ice-cream, looking absently at the TV, with the same mean look on her face. 
HOTEL ATHERTON - A BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Sam is sitting on a chair, naked. Allison, also naked, is sitting on his laps, facing him, and with her legs spread on either side of the chair. She is moving up an down. They evidently are having an intercourse. 
Close-up on Allison's hand behind Sam's back. She is wearing her engagement ring. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Hedra is lying naked in the bath. The bath is almost full, but hot water is still pouring from the tap. Hedra, her eyes closed, is humming some music. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
Full view of the building. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - MAIN ENTRANCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
A Yellow Cab is parked in front of the entrance. On the sidewalk, Sam and Allison are hugging and kissing. 
Allison moves away from Sam and into the building. Sam goes back into the cab. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT 
The front door opens. Allison comes in and closes the door behind her. She locks the door and puts the security chain on. She puts her keys on the shelf by the door, and looks through her mail. She stops near Hedra's bedroom closed door, because she notices there is still some light in the room. She then goes to the telephone table to look at the answering machine. 
Still looking through her mail, she enters her bedroom.

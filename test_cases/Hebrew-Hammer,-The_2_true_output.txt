HAMMER (CONT'D) That's...uh...that's all done electronically now. 
Still a look of disbelief. 
ESTHER Why are you being so difficult? All my father wants is to just speak with... 
HAMMER I hate to cut you short, but in an hour the sun goes down, and then it's officially the Sabbath. I can't work on the Sabbath. This is where we're going to have to part ways boobola. 
The Hammer grabs his overcoat from the coat rack. Esther gets up as well. 
ESTHER I'm not leaving your side until I get you to agree to come speak with my father. 
It's obvious the Hammer's amused by her persistence. 
HAMMER Be my guest. But I have to warn you, I'm going to my mother's for dinner tonight. And if you think I'm difficult, wait till you meet her. 
The two walk towards the front door of the office. 
ESTHER (Solemnly) Before we leave, there's just one more thing. I noticed that the sign on your door says you're a certified circumcised dick. Would you mind if I asked to see your credentials? 
The Hammer looks directly into the camera and shakes his head proudly. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MRS. CARVER'S HOUSE - SHABAT 
We start on the outside of the front door as we hear the Ding of the doorbell. MRS. CARVER, the epitome of Jewish motherhood opens the door. 
For all the Gentiles reading, I thought I might digress for just a moment. JEWISH MOTHER (adj.) A complicated and charismatic package of the following qualities rolled into human female form: intense, judgmental, overbearing, manipulative, lacking boundaries, yet fiercely involved, loving, and protective of her children. Got it? 
MRS. CARVER Mordechai! Shabat Shalom! 
The Hammer pulls a bottle of wine out from a paper bag. 
HAMMER Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label. 
MRS. CARVER I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us. 
Mrs. Carver forcefully grabs Esther into an embrace resembling a bear hug, and begins to plaster her with sloppy kisses. Esther is visibly overwhelmed by it all as the kissing and embracing continue for a bit too long. 
Mrs. Carver places her tongue into Esther's ear canal as a sign of affection, forcing Esther to break the embrace. Mrs. Carver and Esther look at one another strangely for an awkward few moments. 
MRS. CARVER (CONT'D) So. Do you have a name? 
ESTHER It's Esther. 
MRS. CARVER (She sighs ferclempt) From the story of Purim. (To Hammer) Well, now that we're all acquainted, let's sit down and start the Sabbath. 
CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD: 4 HOURS LATER 
INT. MRS. CARVER'S DINING ROOM - 4 HOURS LATER 
The Hammer and Esther grasp their stomachs which protrude from underneath their slightly unbuttoned shirts. Plates of half-eaten food are everywhere. On the table, on the dining room furniture behind them, etc. 
HAMMER Oy vey, I'm stuffed. 
ESTHER I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me. 
Mrs. Carver enters the dining room through the kitchen door carrying an enormous platter loaded with serving dish after serving dish of food. 
MRS. CARVER Everybody ready for the main course? 
Esther and the Hammer exchange looks. 
HAMMER Mom, I think we've had enough. 
Mrs. Carver places the food on a dresser opposite the kitchen table and then sits.

COLTER You see this? Colter pulls out the DETONATOR CELL PHONE -- the one he took off the bomb. Holds it inches from Derek's face. 
COLTER Now you can't blow it up. 
DEREK What is this? Get away from me! The BARREL of a 9 MM PISTOL. Aimed right at him. 
COLTER Believe me, I'm very accurate with one of these things. 
DEREK Jesus. Derek raises his hands. Sweating. All fright. Like a decent man, terrorized. It gives Colter pause. Does he have the right guy? A toilet FLUSHES. The last stall door opens and Guzman emerges. Stops cold as Colter swings the pistol at him. 
COLTER Stay there, my man. 
DEREK Don't hurt me. 
COLTER Stop acting, for Chrissakes. 
DEREK Keep my wallet. Take my watch. Take anything you want. Unprompted, Guzman takes out his own wallet and sets it on the counter. Calmer than Derek. Accustomed to trouble. 
GUZMAN There. Now you have two wallets. Take them and go. 
COLTER Shut up! Tensing. This isn't supposed to happen like this. 
DEREK Please. I have a family. 
COLTER What about those other passengers? Don't you think they had families? 
GUZMAN Just what is this about? 
COLTER This man's a terrorist. He planted a bomb on the train. 
DEREK 
(HALF LAUGHS) What? Click. Colter pulls back the hammer and savagely JAMS the barrel of the pistol into Derek's cheek. 
COLTER What's the next attack? Who else are you going to kill today, huh? 
DEREK 
(IN TEARS) Oh God... Oh God... Guzman takes a step towards Colter. 
COLTER One more step, asshole. 
GUZMAN Don't treat him like this. He's not an animal. Neither are you. 
DEREK Listen to him. For God's sake I'm not a terrorist...! A URINE STAIN spreads on Derek's pants. He looks down, ashamed. Colter keeps the gun on him. 
COLTER Piss all you want. You took eighty million dollars to kill hundreds of people today. 
DEREK Eighty million dollars? I swear to you... 
COLTER Then what about the wallet, huh? Why the fuck did you twice try to leave your wallet on board? 
DEREK 
I... I... 
COLTER Time's up! What is it?! What is the next attack! So help me, I'll put this bullet through your brain. 
DEREK I don't know what you're talking about! 
COLTER I'm going to do it. Tightening his finger around the trigger. Tears are streaming down Derek's face. But he's not going to talk.

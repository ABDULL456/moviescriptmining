Following the lead, the entire church stands for Letty.    She smiles at Michael. 
INT. BALLROOM - COUNTRY CLUB - LATER 
A parade of guests pass through the receiving line to greet Mr. Mayer, Monica, Letty, Mrs. Mayer, Ruth and Jake. 
Michael hovers close to Letty. AUNT LILY, with fluorescent red hair and a silver lame miniskirt, spots him. 
AUNT LILY (to Michael) What a beautiful wedding. 
As she passes out of earshot, 
MICHAEL (to Letty) Aunt Lily? 
LETTY Bingo. 
Mrs. Mayer talks to her brother CORT. 
MRS. MAYER Oh, and have you met Michael?    He's Letty's boyfriend. 
Letty and Ruth overhear this. They make eye contact.   Ruth raises her eyebrows toward Letty. Letty smiles back. 
INT.   BALLROOM - LATER 
Ruth and Letty talk while Michael twirls across the dance floor with Monica. 
RUTH The worst was when I stammered Jake's name. 
LETTY I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect. 
RUTH That's thanks to all your help. 
Cort, overweight and red from drink, approaches Ruth and Letty. 
LETTY Uh oh, Uncle Cort at 6 o'clock. 
RUTH Sorry to do this to you. But I am the bride. 
Ruth turns and flees. CORT pounces on Letty and plants the wettest kiss ever on her mouth. 
CORT (to Letty) I don't think I've seen you in two or three years. 
LETTY Has it been that long? 
CORT You were with that lawyer. 
LETTY I'm dating Michael now. 
CORT Met him in the receiving line. What is it that he does for a living? 
Michael walks up to Letty and Cort as they speak. 
LETTY Well, he just got a job... M ICHAEL In the restaurant business. 
Letty looks at Michael, surprised. 
CORT Speak of the devil. (beat) How did you guys meet again? 
LETTY At the psych hospital. 
CORT I would've sent a card, but your aunt and I, we weren't sure if that was the thing to do. 
LETTY That's fine, Uncle Cort. 
CORT (to Michael) So you were a volunteer over at the hospital? 
MICHAEL Something like that. 
LETTY When he could get time off from the restaurant business. 
MICHAEL (to Letty) How about a dance? 
CORT You two go ahead. I'm going to go bother that pretty sister of yours for a dance. 
Cort gives Letty another big, wet kiss. 
LETTY Bye, Uncle Cort. (to Michael) What's with the lie? 
MICHAEL It wasn't exactly a lie. 
LETTY Pretty close. 
MICHAEL People at weddings don't want the truth. 
Michael grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. 
LETTY It's not good to drink so much with the medication you're on. 
MICHAEL What's with this music? I'll go talk to the D.J. and see if we can't get something good going.

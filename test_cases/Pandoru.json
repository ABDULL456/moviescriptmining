{"train": "PANDORUM \nWritten by \nTravis Milloy \nDEEP SPACE \nA darkness like no other, a silence that is unsettling. Sharp pinholes of light show a sea of distant stars across the void of outer space. Our own motion is only realized as an enormous object slowly moves towards us, taking shape. A SPACE SHIP of unimaginable size, a tubular freighter easily ten times larger then any aircraft carrier. At first glance it appears lifeless and adrift, but slowly the small glow of cockpit windows come into view as we move closer. Moonlight cuts across the hull, displaying the name; EDEN. \nBOWER (V.0.) Where were you... when Eden was lost? Like every other kid on my block, I was in the middle of a dream, envious of those who were chosen to be part of mankind's greatest quest. Dreaming of the unknown and trying to imagine what only the lucky few would encounter. We PUSH IN towards the cockpit windows and... \nDISSOLVE THRU: \nINT. COCKPIT (EDEN) - CONT. \nInside the flight deck it's ghostly vacant, rows of empty flight chairs and numerous guidance computers gently blinking. With half filled coffee-cups and jackets hung over the seat backs... it appears the control deck has been suddenly evacuated. Muffled SCREAMS are heard somewhere deeper inside the ship. \nBOWER.(V.0.) As the entire world watched in wonder, there were only a few, skeptical of the journey's success. \n(BEAT) Only a few... who would be right. The further we move into the ship... signs of violence appear, smears of dark blood sharply standing out on the bright white paneling and several broken computer screens. The muffled SCREAMS grow louder and clearer... an argument between men, panicked rage over-lapping. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: CAMERA slowly moves past a corner to see the middle-of a violent confrontation. One OFFICER is locked inside a sleep chamber, banging on the glass and pleading with panic. Another OFFICER is on the floor, mortally wounded, his body still twitching with his head bashed in. The INSANE OFFICER, a young corporal is moving from terminal to terminal, typing in commands with a casual and emotionless nature. Blood streams have run down his face from both ears and nose as he continues to type commands into the flight computer... heightening the trapped OFFICER'S muffled,. screams. \nTRAPPED OFFICER \n(IN FRENCH) \nSTOP IT! STOP FOR GOD'S SAKES! PLEASE! \nGOD NO! The INSANE OFFICER hits the final command key and warning buzzers ignite with flashing lights. He closes his eyes, taking a breath of relief. \nTRAPPED OFFCIER \n(IN FRENCH) \nSTOP IT! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS WILL \nDO TO- YOU'RE NOT- STOP! YOU'RE GOING \nTO FUCKING KILL US ALL! The trapped OFFICER begins pounding on the glass with a crazed panic as the INSANE OFFICER calmly goes to his own sleep-pod and climbs inside, sealing the hatch. \nTRAPPED OFFCIER (CONT-D) \n(IN FRENCH) \nPLEASE GOD! NO! NO GOD DAMMIT! Control panels flash and hydraulics ignite. Like a row of tumbling dominos, each of the sleep-chamber pods shift positions with a SHUSH of hydraulics and then... they are launched with a ROAR of micro-jets. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SHIP \"EDEN\" - CONT. \nWe're suddenly back into the unsettling silence as... like a bee hive that's exploded, thousands of coffin-sized sleep pods are ejected from the ship in unison. They are sent tumbling into open space in every direction as the ship slowly continues its unaffected course. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The trapped OFFICER is seen SCREAMING in silence inside his own pod. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. OUTER SPACE \nWe slowly float towards an astroid field. As we grow closer it's the sea of sleep pods slowly floating through space. \nBOWER (P.O.) Where was I... when I heard we'd lost Eden? Just like every other kid on my block... I was dreaming... of being one who would be chosen to follow. As we move closer to the asteroid field of sleep pods, it's obvious that time has passed, a single skeleton inside each of the pods, hands in a clawing position towards the glass. We PUSH IN towards one pod, moving towards the SKULL, still locked in a SCREAMING position, wide mouthed and... \nCUT TO: \nM. HYPER-SLEEP CHAMBER A RUMBLE passes... EYELIDS TWITCH... A GASP. Inside a coffin-size chamber, a dim glow of light seeps through a small glass porthole. A MAN is asleep, a mask attached to his face, tubes of liquid feeding into his arms. CORPORAL BOWER, military physique, chiseled features. His chest lightly expanding, blood pulsating through his veins. Lights FLICKER PAST and his body comes to life, muscles flinching, breath quickening. He squirms with discomfort, ripping away the mask. He gasps, trying to SCREAM. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - CONT. \nHis scream is muffled under three inches of glass. The hatch door is hit with a THUD and white gases erupt from the edges. THUD, THUD... THUD! The door bursts open and BOWER scampers out, struggling to rip away the feeding tubes. He HITS the floor, naked and gasping. His pores ignite, dripping sweat. He tries to get to his feet, but his legs wobble underneath him, collapsing. He yells at the floor. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOWER Burns are red! Bruises... blue- His voice echoes into the dark, alone in a cavernous room as he pauses, struggling for orientation. He gets to his feet, muscles twitching. His short-cropped hair is... pure white. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nPAYTON Aren't they suppose to be here... to wake us? \nBOWER Sir... I don't know where anyone is. PAYTON takes breaths, trying to regain his senses, glancing around at their darkened surroundings. \nPAYTON Hit the lights, will ya? \nBOWER Ah... we're having some power problems- \nPAYTON Who woke you up? \nBOWER Umm, not sure. It had to have been the flight computer. There's no one here... (off his look) .except us. \nPAYTON Cold in here. BOWER grabs him a towel and water container, turning back to see PAYTON doesn't waste any time, stretching his limbs. \nBOWER There's no power coming off the main grid. Can't fire any of the... (searching for word) Dynos. Can't even open the doors. PAYTON glances to the other empty sleep-chamber with a frown. \nBOWER (CONT'D) (off his look) Our 2nd Lieutenant? I don't know where he is. It was empty when I woke up. None of the systems are on-line. Mainframe is down, so I don't know how or why it engaged independently- \nPAYTON Bower . \nBOWER Yeah? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nPAYTON Until I have two coffees you're just gonna have to repeat all this shit, so let's just idle here for a bit. \nBOWER Sorry. I just- Just glad to see you awake. i was... a little concerned. I didn't know what to do if- PAYTON gets to his feet, stumbling. BOWER catches him under the arm as they stagger into the wall. \nBOWER (CONT`D) Easy... Lieutenant. Easy. \nPAYTON Coffee? \nBOWER I'm on it. \nPAYTON Good man. BOWER helps him to the locker room as LIGHTS FLICKER past. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nPAYTON staggers along the row of storage lockers as BOWER helps guide him with the flashlight beam. PAYTON pauses with a frown as he glances across the name-plates, none of them seeming familiar. BOWER gestures toward the locker, the name- plate reads: LT. PAYTON. \nBOWER This is you, sir. \nPAYTON How do you know that? \nBOWER 1 It's... the name on your sleep pod, sir. PAYTON opens the door to see his belongings inside, a photo of WIFE (MARIANNE) inside the door. He stares at it with utter confusion. BOWER takes this in, looking to the memory recovery card inside the locker. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOWER (CONT'D) it says that the memory loss is only suppose to be a momentary loss that's- \nPAYTON Very reassuring. I guess when you gamma the brain into extended REM, sometimes it can take a while to get it back. PAYTON pulls on his flight uniform and squeezes his feet into his shoes. BOWER notices the identification tattoo on his forearm, partially obscured from view; FLT>>00... (obscured by grime, hair and angle). Unlike his own, PAYTON'S tattoo is faded with age. \nBOWER I've been awake for at least an hour and I still can't remember my... anything. \nPAYTON Listen, the last time I crawled out of a hyper bunk, it took me... quite a while to get it all back. BOWER holds his frown as PAYTON squeezes his finger into a wedding ring. \nBOWER What was... your last flight, sir? \nPAYTON \n(BEAT) Don't recall. The Kuiper Belt odyssey? Don't worry, it'll come back, eventually. PAYTON kisses the photo of his wife. \nPAYTON (CONT'D) I've gone through this before. I just can't remember why I would agree to do it again. PAYTON goes to close his locker and BOWER motions with a serious tone. \nBOWER Sir? I know this is going to sound strange, but do you even know where we're going? I can remember the training, but... not the mission. Know the procedures, not the... destination. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nPAYTON I figured you'd tell me. \nBOWER Didn't even know the ship's name until I saw it-on the console. For all I know this was another damn training exercise- \nPAYTON Trust me, it's not. if this is a simulation... PAYTON notices both of their reflections off the mirrored panel inside the locker... revealing their WHITE HAIR. \nCUT TO: \nINT. VENTILATION SHAFT - MOMENTS LATER \nTheir lights spill inside an endless steel shaft only a foot and a half in diameter, leading into darkness. \nPAYTON Now if we only had a monkey and a rope. PAYTON climbs down as BOWER rotates his jaw with eagerness. \nBOWER Our 2nd Lieutenant must have gone this way. Don't you think? \nPAYTON Must have. \nBOWER It's the only way out. \nPAYTON I think we're better off... waiting here- \nBOWER For what? If the mainframe is off-line- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED : \nPAYTON We're not going to be able to get to the bridge or even be able to open that door from the other side- \nBOWER But we can at least find out what's \nHAPPENED- \nPAYTON Do you remember just how big this ship is, kid? We don't know where that will come out, if at all- \nBOWER But, we can at least try to- \nPAYTON \n(SOBERLY) I can't do that. \nBOWER Can't do... Sir? \nPAYTON Listen, I have to take a handful of Doxitol just to get in the hyper-bunk. \nBOWER You're... claustrophobic? \nPAYTON I can take a lot, that's not one of 'em. \nBOWER \n(BOLDLY) I can take it. \nPAYTON \n(SIGH) Real boy scout, is that it? You get lost in there and you're a footnote in the \nFLIGHT REPORT- \nBOWER You can guide me... over two-way. PAYTON eyes him over with reluctance. \nBOWER (CONT'D) You know there's something wrong. How long can we wait in here before we have to try something? \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBOWER (CONT'D) (gesturing to 2nd Lt pod) How long did he wait? Silent stare as a SHUDDER passes, flickering the lights. \nBOWER (CONT'D) What if no one else is awake and there's no one at the wheel? \nCUT TO: \nINT. STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nThey dig through compartments, collecting tools. BOWER puts on a boom-mic, clips the radio on his belt and tests the transmitter. PAYTON goes through a drawer of office supplies, handing him an ENVELOPE OPENER. \nPAYTON Just in case... (off his look) .there's mail you need to open quickly. BOWER tucks it into a zipper pocket and his photograph falls out. PAYTON watches as he tucks it back in and zips up. \nPAYTON (CONT'D) Wife...? \nBOWER Yeah... I think so. \nPAYTON Must be newlyweds. How can you forget something like that? \nBOWER What do-you remember? Anything yet? \nPUSH IN As he stares at the emblem, it seems memories are returning, a frown hardening on his face. Distant THUMPS snap him from his trance and he pans his flashlight towards the wall. \nTHUMP... SCRAPE... THUMP. He nervously pans his light slowly up the wall and across the ceiling. A shiver of uneasiness goes through him as he sits, trapped within the room alone. He tries to divert his fears, turning to the control screen, giving the hand-crank a whirl. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. VENTILATION SHAFT - LATER \nPitch black. Grunt, slide, breath. Grunt, struggle, breath. BOWER pauses, digging for his lamp. He's soaked with sweat, eyes nearing desperation. Pipes are cutting through the shaft on both sides, making his crawl space even smaller and much more difficult. \nBOWER \n(GASPING) Payton? Nothing but STATIC. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOWER (CONT'D) Payton!? Do you copy!? HEY!? Finally... \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) (filled with static) I'm here. You alright? BOWER rubs the sweat from his eyes, anxiety increasing with his heavy breathing. \nBOWER I dunno. I dunno if I can- I can't tell if I'm going in circles or- There's nothing to- Can't breath- \nPAYTON Easy, pal. Breath easy. Listen to me- BOWER squirms, pushing outward against the walls of the shaft with an increasing panic. \nBOWER I just want... to stand up for God's sakes! Can't breath- \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) Calm down. Listen, you gave it a shot. Let's get you back here. \nBOWER Back!? Are you kidding- I can't turn around! I can't even- Do you know how far I've gone!? \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) Take it easy- BOWER bangs the wall of the shaft with desperation. \nBOWER I just want OUT of this FUCKING THING! \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK \nPAYTON is helpless, listening as BOWER is heard on the radio starting to FREAK OUT. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPAYTON Bower? BOWER!? Stop it. Stop it! Just listen to me. Put it out of your head. Stop moving and breath. Listen to \nMY VOICE- \nBOWER (ON RADIO) I can't... breath! \nPAYTON Put your mind somewhere else- \nBOWER (ON RADIO) Like WHERE!? \nPAYTON Well... this may not be the best time to tell you, but I got the door open. \nI \nCUT TO: \nINT. VENTILATION SHAFT \nBOWER freezes in shock. \nBOWER WHAT!? Are you fucking kidding me!? \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) Yeah. I'm kidding you. BOWER lowers his head with exhaustion and a chuckle. \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) (CONT'D) There ya go. Now just breath. Easy, pal. Easy. We'll get you through this. We'll figure this out together. Hear me? I do remember something. \nBOWER What's that? \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) My dream. On the way out. Real doozy. There I was at the Rose Bowl game. Naked and everyone was drunk but me. Spent two years looking for clothes. Long fucking Rose Bowl game. BOWER chuckles, his breathing growing more steady. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED : \nBOWER Dream like that, sounds like you've got some... guilt issues. \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) Or just... clothing issues. \nPitch BLACK. BOWER squirms, twisting and heaving inside the steel vise deathtrap. GASP, GASP, GASP! And then... The RUMBLE approaches. A SHUDDER that sends a domino effect of metallic CLANKS towards him from below. Small shafts of light break through as small vents open in the side walls. His fingers dig the envelope opener from his pocket as the RUMBLE fades, CLANKING the vents shut just as... He stabs the envelope opener into an open vent. Metal bends. He begins to BANG his elbow against the vent, over and over. \nBANG! BANG! BANG! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) Bower!? Answer me! BANG, BANG... BASH! He breaks the vent and kicks until he's able to push his legs through, into darkness, scrambling. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK \nPAYTON is on the edge of his chair, pressing the speaker to his ear. \nPAYTON Bower...!? Through the static comes a HOWL of victory. \nBOWER I'm... out! I'm- PAYTON breathes a heavy sigh of relief. \nPAYTON Jesus, don't scare me like that! Where are you? \nCUT TO: \nINT. STORAGE BIN \nBOWER snaps a GLOW STICK to life to see himself inside a small box-shaped bin, kneeling on top of dozens of BOOTS. \nBOWER I'm- I'm inside a boot locker! \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) A what!? \nBOWER I'm inside a God damn- He shoves outward and the door SNAPS open. He falls out, flips through the air and SLAMS to the floor, an IMPACT on the radio sends... \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK \nA POP of static erupts over the speaker. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPAYTON Bower...? You alright? BOWER!? \nCUT TO: \nINT. STORAGE COMPARTMENT - CONT. \nBOWER painfully gets to his feet to see rows of storage compartments, looking up to the storage bin he fell out of. \nBOWER Make that an overhead compartment. You with me, Payton? I got out. Hear me? He checks the transmitter, crackling with static. \nCUT TO: \nI \nI INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - CONT. \nPAYTON adjusts the frequency with concern. \nPAYTON Bower? Do you hear me? Bower...? Nothing but STATIC. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STORAGE COMPARTMENT - CONT. \nBOWER digs into a storage bin, finds another flashlight and goes to a single paneled hatch. He flips the switch and .nothing. His eyes quickly search for a solution. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STORAGE COMPARTMENT/CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER \nA panel is BUSTED open and BOWER jabs a pipe into the gap, forcing the door open. SHUSH... the hydraulic pistons ignite and the hatch slides open with an echoing... THUD! He cautiously steps out into... \nFOLLOW THRU: \nINT. CORRIDOR - CONT. \nHis beam of light stabs into the darkness of the massive corridor. This is our first sense of the enormity of the ship, endless steel ribbed passageways that stretch in both directions as far as the light will illuminate. \n(CONTINUED) \nNADIA SHOES! I'll gut your ass- \nBOWER Alright, alright! Take it easy! He begins to remove his shoes and the radio on his belt suddenly CRACKLES with activity. \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) Bower? You there-? BOWER lunges and they go into a violent spin, crashing over a table. Dishes clatter, gasps and grunts... only glimpses of the fight through the flicker of light. CRACK! BOWER'S hit, sent flying and he looks up to see her silhouette approaching, edged weapon in her hand. \nBOWER Stop! Stop it! Listen to me! Hold it! she attacks and he frantically throws dishes and chairs to fend her off. She throws the blade, the blunt end deflecting off his forearm. \nBOWER (CONT'D) You crazy fucking bitch- He wields the only weapon he can find... his shoe. And her attack abruptly halts, slowly back pedalling with fright. BOWER is confused, realizing her eyes are looking past him. A BLUISH GLOW seeps in from the doorway, approaching from the corridor. He looks back to see NADIA is running for the kitchen... gone. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nBOWER (CONT'D) \nSHIT- He ducks below the tables as a FIGURE slowly enters the room, carrying a long steel spear-like device with a splinter of blinding BLUE FIRE on the tip, fueled with a chemical sprayer like a welder's torch. His obstructed view reveals the FIGURE as a tribal warrior, scantily clad, elongated muscular frames, pale skin coated in hydraulic fluid. Bald head with clumps of tangled hair. It moves smoothly and silently, jabbing the tip of the flaming device into each corner and crevasse, as if flushing out anything hidden. \nBOWER (CONT-D) (under his breath) What the hell is- The FIGURE quickly spins his direction and SNAPS a lever on the spear-device, killing the blue flame and taking us instantly into darkness. BOWER holds his breath with fright, back pedalling on his knees as his eyes try to adjust to the dark. He takes an uneasy breath to realize... there is more then one. Slowly moving out of the shadows, four more HUNTERS slowly emerge, like a unified pack on the prowl. They carry an assortment of crudely made weapons, spears and blades of sharpened metal. The apparent leader of the pack is HEFLIN, the largest and strongest of the group and he directs the pack with an assortment of odd vocal sounds, deep HISSES from the throat and gargled CACKLES. On command, the one HUNTER flips a lever and the BLUE FLAME crackles back to life with a burst of flammable liquid. The hunt continues, the pack weaving through the debris, following NADIA'S path. As the BLUISH GLOW fades, BOWER is left bewildered and terrified. Suddenly, his radio sounds... \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) Is that you!? Bower-- BOWER frantically flips it off as one of the HUNTERS suddenly turns back. \nE WEASEL, a small framed hunter searches the area like a hunting dog, sniffing the spot. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) On closer examination, WEASEL is coated with war paint and decorative scars marking his skin. \nBOWER POV The only clear view is off an overturned bowl that shows WEASEL'S face, oddly contorted in the rounded reflection. WEASEL is headed directly for BOWER until.., a HISS from HEFLIN calls him back. WEASEL takes one last look before turning back, the torch fades from view, taking us into black. We hear... BOWER'S breath, heightened gasps of fear as he begins to crawl away. \nDISSOLVE THRU BLACK: \nI INT. OFFICER'S QUARTERS - LATER \nI Pitch black. Sounds of the ship surround us along with the occasional FLICKER of LIGHT. A whispered conversation between BOWER and the radio slowly comes into ear-shot as we find him, hidden beneath a console. \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) (muffled with static) .with that marking, she's got to be part of the passenger manifest. Possibly a glitch in the LFS support system, a breakdown in the main grid must have woken passengers, instead of the flight crew. \nBOWER But, why would she try to kill me!? She was going to slit my throat! And why would they look like that? \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) Look like what? \nBOWER You should have seen these guys. They were... a very fucked up looking gang. Why the hell would they be-- Payton, they were hunting. BOWER gives himself a shiver as he fearfully checks over his shoulder, eyes shifting with fear. \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) Hunting!? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOWER They sure-as-shit weren't a welcoming party from the Promenade deck! These guys were... looking to do some damage. \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) Take it easy- \nBOWER We've got to try to contact the bridge. \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) You're assuming there is someone on the bridge. \nBOWER You're not!? We're not the only ones awake. Team Four wouldn't go back to sleep without waking us for rotation. Maybe they're on the main deck? \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - CONT. \nPAYTON goes to the doors, coated with desperate scrapes and dents. \nPAYTON If they're in there... why haven't they thrown the security hammer into lock down? Seal and freeze it until the emergency units wake? \nBOWER Maybe they can't. With the systems kicking on and off- Maybe they're flying blind, with no control of the LFS? PAYTON eyes the scattered tools across the floor and the ripped open ventilation shaft. \nPAYTON Either way we can't assume help will be coming. On-board or off. Out here, there is no rescue. There is no turning around. This thing wasn't even built... .to return. He pauses off the involuntary memory relapse, looking to the I computer screens, taking in the thought. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOWER What are you talking about? PAYTON glances across the control console, nodding with more memories returning. \nPAYTON This is no regular transport. We're not out collecting data off the belt or hauling cargo... we are the cargo. It was a single launch trajectory for... That's as far as his memory allows, his words trailing off. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OFFICER'S QUARTERS - CONT. \nANGLE ON In the foreground, there is a small fish tank, completely dry with a tiny fish skeleton laying on the bottom. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - CONT. \nPAYTON spins the hand-crank, allowing the computer screen to glow brighter. He quickly works the keyboard, pulling up a diagram of the ship. \nPAYTON (INTO RADIO) Alright. I'll lay out a path for you and see if we can by-pass the main security doors. \nBOWER (ON RADIO) Guide me to where? \nPAYTON Back toward the flight decks. Back to me. \nBOWER (ON RADIO) I'm not coming back to you. What good would that do? I can't open that door from the other side-- \nPAYTON What chance have you got out there on your own? We'll figure out a way to breach the command bridge- A power surge sends a SHUDDER and FLICKERING LIGHTS past... \nFLICKER CUT TO: \nINT. CORRIDOR - CONT. \nThe same shudder of FLICKERING LIGHTS passes BOWER as he looks down the endless stretch of corridors, pondering. \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) Bower...? \nBOWER Listen... if you can get me to the reactor bay. I can... reset the reactor's cycle. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) You know how to do that? \nBOWER \n(MASKING UNCERTAINTY) Yes. If I can... we can take control of the ship. Open the doors, lights, get on the bridge. You got a better suggestion? \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - CONT. \nPAYTON'S fingers slide across the blueprints, jotting down hatch numbers and markers leading to the REACTOR BAY. SOUNDS are heard in the walls... THUMP, THUMP, THUMP. PAYTON is too focused on the job at hand to acknowledge them. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CORRIDOR INTERSECTION - LATER \nThe flashlight emerges from the dark as BOWER reaches an intersection, checking the marker and gasping for breath. \nI BOWER \n(GASPING) Third crossing. Marker D-5381-X. \nPAYTON Okay. Hold up. I don't want you to go too far down that lane. Just catch your \nBREATH AND- \nBOWER \n(GASPING) I don't need a rest. Which way? \nPAYTON I don't know vet. Hold on- BOWER backs to the wall, nervously scanning the corridor, struggling for breath. In the background a SHADOW moves at the end of the corridor. \nI Feeling uneasy, BOWER slowly backs into a nearby compartment. \nI FOLLOW THRU: \nINT. INFIRMARY - CONT. \nBOWER looks across the wreckage of what was once an infirmary, slash marks and battle scars from bladed weapons. Through the wreckage he spots... what appears to be a WINDOW. The haze of outer space and an odd-colored MOON are visible. \nBOWER (under his breath) Eden. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLEEP CH.A.MBER/CONTROL DESK \nPAYTON suddenly leans forward in his chair, memory sparked. \nPAYTON What did you say? \nI \nNO! PLEASE!! AAAERRGH! BOWER hits him in the gut, knocking the air from his lungs. SHEPARD crumbles, wheezing for air, going silent. \nBOWER \n(ANGERED WHISPER) I'm not gonna hurt ya! Just shut the hell up! I'm gonna get you out of this thing. But, you have to be quiet, understand? SHEPARD'S gaze is hollow and disturbed, deeply traumatized. BOWER pulls on the wire that's rigged to the hydraulics of a nearby doorway, SHEPARD moans. \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) Bower, you sure that's a good idea? He \nCOULD BE- SNAP! The wire snare snaps free and SHEPARD goes to the floor gasping. BOWER kneels over him to help, but SHEPARD erupts with a shriek, like a hyper-sensitive rape victim. \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) (CONT'D) Watch yourself! BOWER hesitates, the flashlight reveals SHEPARD'S identification tattoo through the ripped uniform and blood- soaked bandages. It reads; FLT//006//017 \nBOWER He's... team six. The unit that's suppose to follow us. He's- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) As BOWER tries to wipe away blood, SHEPARD erupts again, trying to scamper away from his touch. \nBOWER (ON RADIO) (CONT'D) Quiet! I'm not gonna hurt you! SHEPA.RD begins to moan, mumbling and weeping as he rubs circulation back into his limbs with nervous laughter. \nBOWER (CONT'D) Hey? You with me? You're gonna be alright. Hear me? Squinting past the glare of the flashlight, SHEPARD notices BOWER'S clean uniform and the radio boom on his chin. He begins to weep, tears of joy and agony. \nSHEPARD Shepard, Thomas L. Team Six. Sector Eight. I think I'm the only one, sir. I knew it. I knew you'd be coming. \nBOWER Huh? \nSHEPARD Where's the rest of your squad? \nBOWER Squad? My Lieutenant and I were the- \nSHEPARD Where's the shuttle? \nBOWER Shuttle? What are you talking about? SHEPARD'S expression drops. \nSHEPARD Aren't you the... retraction team? The \nRESCUE- \nBOWER No, no. Hold on. I'm from this crew. I'm from Team Five. SHEPARD'S face goes pale, eyes going hollow. His demeanor slowly begins to shift. \nSHEPARD You... just woke up? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nBOWER six... maybe eight hours ago. I had to crawl all the way from the upper deck \nTHROUGH THE- SHEPARD seems bitterly impatient as he quickly begins gathering his tool's off the floor. His eyes watch the end of the corridor, now he's in a hurry. \nSHEPARD So... you don't have a fucking clue to what's happened? Is that it? \nBOWER That's what we're trying to figure out! Tell me- what happened!? \nI SHEPARD (chuckle of disgust) You know as much as I do. \nBOWER I don't know anything. \nSHEPARD You'll fit right in. i SHEPARD feels along the pipes until he finds one leaking oil. He vigorously begins to rub the oil onto his body. \nBOWER What are you doing? \nSHEPARD Get the scent off. \nBOWER What ! ? SHEPARD rubs oil across his neck and then goes to check the corner, wrapping a strap around his fist to secure a screwdriver into his hand. \nSHEPARD I can't help you. I'm sorry. \nBOWER Help.me? Wait a second- \nSHEPARD They go off scent and sound as far as I can tell and they're a lot fucking stronger and faster they you'd think. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED : (4) \nSHEPARD (CONT'D) When they come... run. Don't look back, no matter what. \nBOWER They- Who the hell are they!? \nSHEPARD I can't wait for you. BOWER is bewildered as SHEPARD poised like a sprinter, preparing to run. \nBOWER (CONT'D) As long as we understand each other. They head out of the room as... NADIA watches from the shadows with a curious frown. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER \nBOWER and TANAKA head down the corridor, both of them checking their backs as they come to a sealed doorway. TANAKA is still wincing, rubbing his chest with pain. \nTANAKA \n(BITTERLY) Japanese- No Subtitles \nBOWER Yeah... well no sympathy here. She left me with a few sore spots too, pal. They both go to work, attempting to wedge the door open with pipes. BOWER looks back to see... NADIA. They back pedal with weapons in hand and NADIA is unaffected, watching them with a frown. \nBOWER (CONT'D) Listen, lady. We don't want any- \nNADIA \n(SOBERLY) Who the hell are you? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOWER Huh? \nNADIA You're... part of the flight crew? \nBOWER Yeah. I'm... a corporal, I'm- \nNADIA I didn't think there was any flight crew left. What's happened to us? \nBOWER That's what I'm trying to figure out. Malfunction of some sort- \nNADIA Gee, you think? Where are you going? \nBOWER I'm heading for the reactor bay. \nNADIA You just wake up? \nBOWER Just joining the program already in progress, yeah. She eyes him over and TANAKA keeps the pipe raised. \nNADIA You'll never make it. \nBOWER Oh yeah? And why is that? \nNADIA You're going the wrong direction. She grimaces and turns, heading back up the corridor. BOWER and TANAKA exchange a look. BOWER chases after her. \nBOWER Hey? Wait a second- HEY? \nNADIR SSSSH! Keep it down- \nBOWER Hold on. Who are you? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nNADIA Nobody. \nBOWER Wait- Can't join the team without a name. \nNADIA Team? Why would I want to join? \nBOWER Because I need you to show me the way. \nNADIA To the reactor? No thanks. Don't like going that fax down. No one ever comes back. She continues up the corridor and BOWER grabs her arm. She yanks away from his touch, squaring off, weapon in hand. \nBOWER Hold on. Please- There's not much time left before we lose everything onboard. You understand what I'm trying to- \nI NADIA Do you know where this ship is headed? \nBOWER I'm working on it. \nNADIA Can you fly it? \nBOWER Huh? \nNADIA Can you fly it... if you have to? \nBOWER \n(NOT SURE) Sure. NADIA eyes him over, sizing him up. \n(GROWL) Quiet! They look to see TANAKA has fallen behind, crouched and peering off towards the dark. He's poised like a dog on the prowl that's caught a bad scent. They crouch and crawl to the adjacent corner. \nBOWER I don't see what he's looking at, do you? \nNADIA We have to keep moving. We don't want to stay out in the open for too long. Especially in here. \nBOWER \n(TO TANAKA) Hey...? Let's go! Distant THUMPS are heard somewhere in the room and they tighten up with their weapons, eyes scanning. TANAKA refuses to look away, poised like a hunter. \nNADIA We can't stay herel NADIA heads across the main floor and BOWER tries to wave him on, but TANAKA is locked onto something, refusing to waver. \nBOWER Let's get out of here! Com'on- The THUMPS grow louder and TANAKA heads into the shadows. BOWER hesitates, turning to follow NADIA through a barricade of dishevelled equipment, leaving TANAKA behind. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PROCESSING DOCK -CONT. \nBOWER emerges from the barricades into a processing center for loading passengers, darkened and in shambles. NADIA is scanning the corridors ahead, choosing her path as BOWER rushes to catch her. \nBOWER We can't just leave him. We have to wait- \nNADIA Then you wait... and find your own way. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOWER We can't split up the team, it's all \nWE'VE GOT- \nNADIA I told you I'm not going to wait. I'm not gonna get myself killed for- \nBOWER The guy saved my life twice already. I'm not gonna leave him- \nNADIA What do you think he's doing in there!? \nBOWER How the hell should I know- \nNADIA He's hunting! Bagging the next notch on his belt. You wait for him! Good luck. I NADIA quickly heads deeper into the room and down a darkened and narrowing tunnel. BOWER hesitates with frustration. Having to choose, he turns and chases after NADIA. I They crawl through a maze of machinery and NADIA'S pace is difficult for BOWER to keep up. \nBOWER Wait! I'm coming- There's a CRUNCH under his foot. He lowers his light, picking up a small white object. He brings it closer to the light to realize it's... A HUMAN FINGER BONE. \nBOWER (CONT'D) Jesus! NADIA turns toward him to see... \nREVERSE ANGLE Behind BOWER is a massive stack of human skeletons and carcasses. They've just crawled into a pit of human remains. They both back away with horror only to see a mountain of carcasses on both sides. The only route is upward and they begin to crawl up the slope on their bellies, over dead remains. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBOWER (CONT'D) \n(HORRIFIED) My God! Wait- Where are we going!? NADIA suddenly grabs him, a quick jerk to silence him. A SHADOW passes with a CACKLING HISS. They freeze, laying on top of the remains, the bones CRINKLING underneath them. The HISS grows stronger... and they look up to see a silhouetted HUNTER crouched over like a gargoyle on a rafter, leering in their direction. \nNADIA \n(WHISPER) Don't move. They try to remain motionless, but the slope of the remains i CRINKLES underneath them and the hill of remains begins to slide. The HISS grows stronger. They hold their position until... a SHUDDER approaches with FLICKERING LIGHTS. The power surge is enough to ignite a small landslide underneath them. \nBOWER \nSHIT- NADIA grabs his arm as bones snap and they slide helplessly to the bottom within a landslide of bones and flesh. The finally slide to a stop at the bottom of the slope and BOWER quickly raises his weapon towards the rafters to see... the HUNTER is gone. \nNADIA \n(WHISPER) Where... did it go-? He pans the light and... ROAR! The HUNTER lunges at them from five feet away. BOWER is STRUCK with enough force to send him flying, CRASHING into a pile of bones. NADIA spins around with a bladed pipe in her hands... but the HUNTER is already gone. She spins back and... THWAP! She's HIT from behind and sent with break-neck force into the floor. The HUNTER pounces onto her back and a claw-like hand grabs her hair... teeth opening towards her neck and... POW! BOWER charges into the HUNTER, tackling it and they spin into a brutal and distorted fight, seen under the FLICKERING LIGHT. Even though the HUNTER is a smaller one,of the pack, smaller then BOWER, its speed and strength is in- human. It grabs BOWER by the head with a GROWL and... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) THWACK! TANAKA lunges out of the shadows, delivering a blow with his bladed pipe into the HUNTER'S face. It's a hit that would normally kill anything, nearly taking its head off. The HUNTER stumbles, staggers and... HIIIISSSSSST! It HITS TANAKA, sending him airborne, nearly knocking him out. Under the FLICKERING LIGHT, BOWER, NADIA and TANAKA all attack the lone HUNTER, taking all three of them to bring it to the floor. They viciously pound it with pipes and blades until it finally stops flinching beneath them. Its pale white skin seeps a thick black colored blood. The three of them back away, gasping and coated in its blood. \nBOWER \n(GASPING) Jesus... Christ- Jesus- Its face is smashed beyond recognition, but its facial features are horrifically distorted, no sign of eyes under the shredded tissue. \nBOWER (CONT'D) What the... what the hell is it!? The HUNTER flinches and our gang back pedals with fright. NADIA continues back pedalling, looking towards the rafters to see... HEFLIN silhouetted, leering towards them. \nNADIA \nANOTHER ONE- BOWER quickly finds his weapon on the floor and HEFLIN slowly begins to TAP his spear against the wall, echoing a continual clank through the hull. \nBOWER What is he... doing? BOWER, NADIA and TANAKA quickly realize the effect as shadows begin to move.., the room is filling with HUNTERS, alerted by the tapping of metal. \nPAYTON To make sure you're... alright. You... passed out. You- \nGALLO Who the hell are you? \nPAYTON Payton... Lieutenant Payton. \nGALLO Lieutenant? You're... a lieutenant? \nPAYTON That's right. You're Team Four? You're suppose to be... my predecessor. GALLO deepens his frown, glancing around with disorientation. \nPAYTON (CONT'D) You said... you came from the bridge? GALLO shifts his eyes back on him, a bad topic. \nGALLO \n(LEERY) Yeah. So...? \nPAYTON Where are we? I can't get guidance off this system and I have no idea where- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nGALLO I don't know. \nPAYTON Well, what did you see? How did-- \nGALLO Listen, I'm not a navigator. Stars all look alike. I don't know! How the hell would I know!? Sensing GALLO is about to break down again, PAYTON tries a calmer approach. \nPAYTON Easy. I just want to make sure... GALLO'S hands are trembling, uncontrollably. \nPAYTON (CONT'D) .you're okay- GALLO tucks his shaking hands under the blanket, defensively. \nGALLO I'm fine. PAYTON lowers his stare, hesitating, glancing across the dried blood still splattered across his legs. \nPAYTON Is this your blood... Corporal? \nGALLO Some of it is... sir. \nPAYTON Whose blood is it? GALLOholds his stare, jaw muscles tightening. \nGALLO They didn't give me any choice. \nPAYTON Who didn't? \nGALLO There was something wrong with them. \nPAYTON i Something was wrong with who? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) Off his stare, he understands the implication. \nPAYTON (CONT' D ) Your crew? \nGALLO It was... Pandorum. (off his look) Of the worst sort. They were- I couldn't even- I had to defend myself. \nPAYTON Pandorum. Both of them-? \nGALLO You don't believe me? \nPAYTON \n(UNCONVINCED) I believe you. PAYTON goes to a nearby compartment, popping open a First-Aid case; inside is a pistol-gripped syringe. He turns back and GALLO squares off, clenched fists. \nGALLO What are you doing? What is that? \nPAYTON It's just a sedative. Help you relax- GALLO lifts his fists with a threatening posture. \nGALLO Then you take it... and relax. PAYTON backs off, setting the syringe aside. \nPAYTON Take it easy. We're on the same team here. Alright? \nGALLO \n(FLATLY) Sure, Lieutenant. PAYTON turns back to the control console and continues his search across the radio frequencies. He discreetly pulls the pipe weapon closer to his seat. GALLO holds a hollow stare on the back of his head. \nI \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) \nGALLO (CONT'D) If you would have seen them... you would have done the same thing... sir. LIGHTS FLICKER past... \nLELAND Well, only the captain. informally, mind you. \nBOWER Captain? Where!? \nLELAND Umm, up on B-Deck. Some on C. A few pieces on the promenade and I think his nuts are in the foose-ball game in the rec room. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He smiles, revealing several missing teeth. No one laughs. \nLELAND (CONT'D) Tough crowd. Com'in, com'in. Grab a bunk. Three singles or will a queen do? LELAND laughs to himself, digging through supplies. BOWER scans the walls, seeing no way up to the catwalks. \nBOWER Why don't you come on down so we can meet properly? \nLELAND Oh, no-no. No-can-do. I'm real touchy to the dust bug and who knows where yawl have been. No offense. There's something funky going around. But don't let that spoil the party. Here... LELAND lowers down a bin filled with assorted food items, using a wire to drop it to them. TANAKA sniffs it with suspicion. \nI LELAND (CONT'D) It's Kosher. BOWER peeks through one of the valves, turning to NADIA. \nBOWER Where do you think we are? \nNADIA I don't know. Gotta be somewhere below B- deck. \nLELAND Why, where you gotta be? \nBOWER The reactor bay. Know where it is? \nLELAND Reactor? Now why would you want to go down there? \n(GRIN) You just woke up, didn't cha? \nCUT TO: \nINT. WATER PROCESSOR - LATER \nA small propane flame is lit. LELAND hovers over a make- shift stove, heating a can of water. He pours in some powder and stirs it up with the meticulous nature of a chef preparing fine cuisine. \nLELAND It's tough to properly season with a motor oil base. But if you use your imagination, kinda tastes like... \n(SIP) Herb and garlic dog shit. Below the catwalks, TANAKA has found a spot to rest, NADIR is using water to clean a wound and BOWER is peering through a slit in a vent. \nBOWER How long have you been awake? \nLELAND Mmmm. Lemme think. What's today, Tuesday? That would be about, mmm... He counts in his head and across his fingers, carefully calculating, then a grin. \nLELAND (CONT'D) No idea. He turns back to his make-shift stove, chuckling to himself. \nLELAND (CONT-D) I quit counting after the band broke up, ooooh twenty... thirty years ago. BOWER and NADIR exchange a look of uncertainty. The classical music begins to SKIP and without even looking LELAND kicks a piece of equipment, correcting the music. \nLELAND (CONT-D) Then again, an hour in this place feels more like... one-fifteen, one-twenty. Know whatta I mean? HA-HP_W! \n(SOBERLY) Not naming names but I'm writing a very strongly worded letter to the airline. LELAND chuckles, nodding to TANAKA. TANAKA glares. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLELAND (CONT-D) But I just treat each day like it's Christmas. Festive and violent. Let's eat; Shall we? Who needs a bib? LELAND sets several bowls of soup into the bin and lowers it to them with the cable. T_ANAKA is the only one interested, sniffing the soup with a glare. LELAND winks. BOWER takes a seat, showing exhaustion and defeat. \nBOWER Those things out there. Could it have been something... that crawled out of your lab? Something that- \nNADIA No. That's... not possible. \nBOWER Then something got on board. Some kind of life form. Something that- \nNADIA Or something that was already on board, with us in the hyper-bunks. \nBOWER What does that mean? \nNADIR it could have been the accelerator. \nBOWER What? \nNADIA It's the only theory I can come up with. The synthetic enzyme in our feeding tubes. The accelerator that would help our bodies adjust and adapt to the environmental conditions on Tanis. From what I've seen... these things have adapted... to the ship instead. \nBOWER But, why would- You're saying we'll become like them? Why would they be affected like that and we're not- \nNADIA I don't know. Like I said, it's the only theory I can think of- Unless... \n(CONTINUED) \nINT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK \nGALLO'S gaze is hollow and translucent as he stares through the glass porthole in the empty sleep chamber, his mind is deeply pondering. Pupils dilated. \nNADIA You don't know that for sure! \nBOWER I know... NADIA grabs him with rage, glaring him in the eye. \nNADIA \nDON'T DO THAT! DON'T GIVE UP ON ME! Off her look, BOWER holds his stare, slowly seduced by her will. They look is broken by... LELAND'S stereo system CRACKLES with static, power slowly returning after the power surge, music playing. BOWER snaps out of his daze, turning to LELAND. \nBOWER You got a radio? \nLELAND Who the hell are you gonna call-? \nBOWER \nDO YOU HAVE A RADIO!? \nLELAND \n(BEAT) You promise to bring it back? \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK \nThe radio speakers on the control console suddenly CRACKLE with STATIC and PAYTON leaps forward in his chair, snapping out of his daze. GALLO looks up with a frown. \nBOWER (ON RADIO) Payton? Do you copy? Can you hear me!? He grabs the receiver. \nPAYTON BOWER! I'm here! Where are you? \nCUT TO: \nINT. WATER PROCESSOR/CATWALK - CONT. \nOur group is now crowded on the catwalk above the tank, huddled around an assortment of patched together electronic equipment. BOWER is speaking into a receiver, bound together with wire while LELAND cranks the power lever. \nBOWER Storage Tanks, just below B-level. Mid- ship Sector twelve... we think. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK \nPAYTON vigorously cranks the power lever and slides his finger across the screen of the ship's blueprint. \nI PAYTON How the hell did you get all the way to Y the other side of- \nI BOWER (ON RADIO) Payton, listen to me. Listen. The I reactor is in its final stage. Its last rotation. It's worse then we thought. PAYTON looks to GALLO, who is silently watching with a hollow glare from the corner. \nBOWER (ON RADIO) (CONT`D) The ship is dying and I think that's why it finally woke us up. The entire system is heading into permanent shutdown and there will be no return. This entire ship will float off into eternity with no way of stopping it. We need to reset it. Are you hearing me? PAYTON and GALLO share a silent stare. \nPAYTON I hear you. How do we get you in there? \nI BOWER I need you to give me a path. PAYTON and GALLO'S silent stare hangs in the air for a moment, the tension between them unclear. PAYTON turns to the console, quickly typing into the keyboard. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LADDER SHAFT/CORRIDOR - LATER \nA flashlight beams cut into a shaft. It appears as if the gang is crawling backwards toward us, until our perspective realizes they're crawling down a long ladder. They reach the bottom level where a distant RUMBLE has grown louder. They follow the sound through a field of debris to a clear path leading to an open hatchway. BOWER checks the marker over the door and leads them down the corridor, preparing to step through and TANAKA grabs him, pulling him back. \nBOWER What? TANAKA motions toward the hatchway, shaking his head. He i gestures for them to follow and leads them over debris and through a hole, hidden in the paneling. \nTANAKA (Japanese - No Subtitles) \nLELAND What did he say? \nBOWER I dunno. But do what he says. They follow TANAKA, crawling through the hole and into... \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOADING PLATFORM \nAs they head across a loading dock, the room gradually grows more disturbed and dishevelled. Battle scars and centuries of wear and tear grow more and more evident as they cross. The BLUE GLOW of light can be seen through the passageway and a low RUMBLE grows louder as they approach. They crouch behind a large industrial condensers to catch their breath. I BOWER glances up to the surface of the condenser with a frown and he touches it with his fingers to find an odd-colored algae. He looks up to see it's grown all the way to... Be freezes to see a small shadowed FIGURE in the rafters above them, a smaller gargoyle-type silhouette, possibly some type of guard outside the entrance to the reactor bay. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: They exchange silent gestures and TANAKA heads one direction as BOWER heads the other... to corner it. The FIGURE begins to move across the rafter as TANAKA flushes it out. The FIGURE is forced to climb down, hopping to the floor, BOWER waits with his gun raised. Out of the shadows steps... A ten-year-old CHILD HUNTER. BOWER flinches with shock. The CHILD is a younger version of the hunters, awkward physique, pale skin coated with hydraulic fluid, oblong shaped head, eyes hidden in shadow. NADIR lowers her weapon. \nNADIA \n(DEVASTATED) Oh... my... God... The CHILD suddenly crouches in a fighting stance with a i gargled HISS from its throat, the light catching its eyes to reveal WHITE RETINAS deeply hidden under a thin membrane of I skin. Everyone is too stunned to react except for TANAKA, who instantly raises his weapon, preparing to kill it. \nNADIA (CONT-D) stop it! STOP IT! Are you crazy? It's just a child! \nNADIA What are you doing? What is it? \nBOWER \n(DAZED) These were... family members of flight personnel. \nNADIA \nFAMILY OF- She notices BOWER is holding EVALON'S photo and glances to the row of empty chambers, slowly realizing his grief. \nNADIA (CONT'D) You think she's... here? \nBOWER She's not here. She's dead. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNADIA How do you know for sure? She could be- \nBOWER She's not on this flight. She wouldn't come with me. She wouldn't marry me. (sigh of disgust) That's why I came. There was nothing left for me there. She stayed on Earth. Gone... with everyone else. And I left because of her. His gaze begins to gloss over, taking it all in. \nNADIA Well, then... she saved your life. BOWER frowns on the thought, slowly nodding in agreement. His eyes look to the label of the chamber he was led to, the label reads; M. PAYTON. He mumbles to himself, memory returning. \nBOWER Marianne. \nNADIA you... knew her? \nBOWER I remember her. Payton's wife. \nNADIA Who's... Payton? \nBOWER I remember her. I remember- His eyes pull focus, coming out of his daze, memories returning with confusion. \nNADIR Are you alright? \nBOWER Com'on. \nBOWER grips his weapon with a flexing jaw of determination, heading back to where TANAKA and LELAND are waiting as we... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nANGLE ON M. PP_YTON'S name plate and the dried remains of her apparent death lay in the foreground. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SLEEP CHAMBERICONTROL DESK \nTHAP... THAP... THAP. Droplets of blood hit the floor at GALLO'S feet as he paces back and forth near the sleep chambers. \nGALLO He's right about one thing. Once that thing shuts down, we're as good as dead. Nothing on this ship will ever turn on again. Ever. Not the air, not the lights, the heat... not even the pod's escape launch systems. PAYTON refuses to look up from the computer. \n3 PAYTON What are you saying? \nGALLO I'm\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdsaying... once it's done. We're done. But, we still have a way out of this... before it's too late. \nPAYTON What are you suggesting, Corporal? \nGALLO We can still launch ourselves in the pods. Before the ignition systems are completely dead, sir. \nPAYTON Launching ourselves... into deep space when we don't even know where we are? We wouldn't last more then a few days inside those things. That's suicide- \nGALLO A few days is better then what we have left here. I'll take my chances. How long do you think that reactor has been sitting? That thing could melt-down when he tries to fire the core. This ship could be ripped in half- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPAYTON Stand down, Corporal. We're not going to abandon anything and we're not going to leave them behind- \nGALLO We can't stay on this ship. You know that as well as I do- \nPAYTON I said stand down, Corporal! That's an order! GALLO steps up behind PAYTON, his face revealed with a thin stream of blood oozing from under his nose, dripping off his chin, eyes hollow and pale. PAYTON refuses to look at him, continuing to type. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOADING PLATFORM - CONT. \nThe HUNTING party has faded from sight in the opposite direction, leaving the hatch open to the reactor bay. \nBOWER This is our chance. BOWER leads the way out of the hiding place, heading quickly towards the open hatch where an eerie glow and rumble is felt. They crawl through the hatch and enter into... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nGALLO I'm getting off this ship. My flight's over. OVER! Another panel on the console begins to gently blink as... \nCUT TO: \nINT. REACTOR CONTROL TERMINAL - CONT. \nBOWER and NADIA cling to the side of the reactor, quietly flipping switches and entering codes as... the sea of HUNTERS sleep below them. BOWER unfolds the auxiliary power lever, each movement creating a CREAK of rusted metal. He grips the handle and slowly begins to turn the magneto crank. The CREAKS of rusted metal and the low WHINE of magnetos grows louder. HUNTERS begin to stir in their sleep as NADIA watches them with fright. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL, DESK \nGALLO is jabbing the pistol-gripped syringe towards PAYTON, motioning him closer to the sleep pods. He motions and PAYTON kneels at the panel... entering the code. \nPAYTON This won't work... \nGALLO Shut-up. GALLO jabs the syringe gun towards the back of PAYTON'S head while putting one foot inside the pod. \nPAYTON just think about what you're doing- \nGALLO \nSHUT-UP! PAYTON continues entering the launch code as GALLO steps inside with his other foot. \nPAYTON It wasn't the crew that was sick, was it? \nGALLO Finish the code... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED : \nPAYTON What did you really do to them...? GALLO slides into the pod and... \nGALLO \nFINISH IT! PAYTON hits a key and LIGHTS BLINK. GALLO looks away for a second and PAYTON suddenly grabs the hatch lever... SLAMMING it closed. He cranks the latch, locking GALLO inside. \nGALLO (CONT-D) \nWHAT ARE YOU DOING!? PAYTON wedges a pipe through the handle as GALLO violently kicks the hatch. \nPAYTON For your own good- \nGALLO \nWHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING!? \nPAYTON You're not well, Corporal. You just need the proper treatment- \nGALLO \nLET ME OUT GOD DAMMIT! OPEN IT!! THAT'S \nAN ORDER MOTHER FUCKER! \nPAYTON This isn't your fault- \nGALLO \nI'LL FUCKING CARVE YOU UP- HEAR ME!? \nI'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FUCKING- \nPAYTON Your mind... has turned against itself. GALLO EXPLODES with RAGE... POUNDING on the hatch with a jack- hammer of fists, bones shattering in his own hands. PAYTON ignores his screams, going back to the console and typing I into the keyboard. \nGALLO \nOPEN THIS HATCH CORPORAL! \nE CUT TO: \nI \nINT. REACTOR CONTROL TERMINAL \nBOWER cranks the hand lever faster and faster, the MOAN of magnetos growing louder and louder. He gives one last spin and hits the primer switch. A split-second of nothing and then the panels brightly come to life. The digital panel reads: >> ROTATION SEQUENCE >> CODE INITIATE TO PROCEED >> BOWER takes a sigh of relief and glances to see NADIA is frozen with fright. He follows their eye-line to see the entire floor of HUNTERS are awake, heads turned towards them. HEFLIN steps closer in their direction with a HISS. BOWER gasps and the entire pack of HUNTERS moves toward them and... suddenly, TANAKA bangs his bladed weapon against the railing with a heavy CLANK! The HUNTERS instantly turn toward his direction and TANAKA throws his weapon, HITTING one of the HUNTERS directly in the head. TANAKA jumps to the neighboring catwalk and breaks through a hatch, coated with vines and vegetation. HEFLIN screeches a command and the HUNTERS ignite in a chain-reaction, grabbing their weapons and taking chase like a swarm of attack dogs. They climb the wall with inhuman speed and rush out the hatch, following TANAKA. \nNADIA Hurry! Go! BOWER turns back to the panel, flipping more switches and continuing the process as the reactor begins to HUM as... \nPAYTON rapidly pounds his fingers into the keyboard and... LIGHTS activate... causing one of the security doors to engage... sliding open. But, it's the wrong door, revealing a corridor leading endlessly into the back of the ship. \nI \nPAYTON \nDAMMIT- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGALLO Where do you think you're going? \nPAYTON \nQUIET- PAYTON continues to work the control panels, looking to the sealed door on the other end of the room. \nGALLO Think about what you're doing, sir- \nPAYTON \nSHUT-UP- GALLO pushes his knees against the hatch, the pipe beginning to bend, the seal CRACKING open. \nGALLO You don't want to see what's in there- \nPAYTON \nSHUT-UP; \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLEEP CRAMBER/MAIN CORRIDOR \nThe control panel on a sleep-chamber is FLASHING as a passenger KICKS his hatch open from the inside. The haggard and bewildered passenger crawls out to find himself in the middle of CHAOS. Before he can get a breath he's attacked by \nHUNTERS. What was once a dark and haunting chamber of metal, is now a disco tech from hell as lights FLASH across the corridor in what appears to be a massive riot, PASSENGERS and HUNTERS fighting. \nANGLE ON/CRANE UP BOWER and NADIA run across the top of the sleep chamber wall, thirty feet above the havoc that's ensuing below. A LIGHT BULBS BURST as... \nMATCH CUT TO: \nINT_ ATRIUM - CONT. Metal blades SPARK as they connect between HEFLIN and TANAKA. The sword play is crude, but powerful and brutal. HEFLIN can't match his skills and pile-drives him, ripping into him with his own bare hands and a horrific SCREECH. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: TANAKA tries to grab a hold of him, but HEFLIN digs in with his teeth, biting into his stomach. TANAKA screams, hitting HEFLIN'S head with everything he's got, but he won't let go. TANAKA lifts HEFLIN'S feet and ROARS as he charges himself directly into the wall, neck bones SNAPPING! HEFLIN goes limp, dropping to the floor dead as TANAKA gasps... looking down to see the damage has been done, blood flowing heavily. He takes a breath, turns to exit FREEZING to see... the CHILD HUNTER standing alone, sensing the death of HEFLIN with almost an expression of sorrow. TANAKA lowers his weapon and... THWACK! The CHILD stabs TANAKA in the chest with a small bladed weapon. TANAKA gasps with shock, collapsing to his knees, eyes wide before going to the floor. The CHILD begins to feed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLEEP CHAMBER/MAIN CORRIDOR \nBOWER and NADIA climb to a cat-walk only to see HUNTERS are following their trail. They run to a ladder and spot LELAND already climbing above them. \nBOWER Go... GO! GO! Half way up, LELAND looks back to see them coming with HUNTERS close behind. He gives them a look before closing the hatch and latching it. \nNADIA You snake bastard- OPEN IT! \nCUT TO: \nINT. CORRIDOR - CONT. \nWith the YELLS muffled under the hatch, LELAND runs towards an open door at the far end of the long corridor. \nANGLE ON Inside the door at the far end... PAYTON is at the control console, quickly typing into the keyboard. He hears the E hatch CRACK open and he spins to see GALLO, out of the pod, with a twisted grin, holding the pistol-gripped syringe. \nGALLO We both know who needs this shot... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: PAYTON counters with the bladed weapon. \nPAYTON \nSTAY BACK- \nGALLO Who's the one suffering... sir- \nPAYTON \nI MEAN IT! PAYTON lunges with the weapon, RAGE in his EYES as... GALLO jabs with the pistol-syringe, they lock hands, grabbing one anothers wrists... slamming into the wall. Upon IMPACT with the wall, GALLO suddenly appears slightly older, his voice lowering in level. \nGALLO Corporal... PAYTON slams him against the wall, making him older. \nGALLO You think God survived? He's gone... with the rest. There's no one left to judge you, Bower. NADIA approaches the glass, squinting towards the heavily smudged glass. She frowns, trying to wipe away the layer of sludge. \nBOWER Judgement will come for you. You think you could cover it? Your victims survived. Evolved. That's your creation out there. Your crime. BOWER jabs the gun into his back with force. \nBOWER (CONT'D) And you thought you'd be able to hide it? Who would ever suspect that? Who would ever remember? I remember. NADIA rubs the glass with her hand, squinting into the darkness. The time-code display rolls faster, decades into centuries... BLIP, BLIP, BLIP. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nGALLO No world left. No law. No order. Only us. You the law now? You gonna be the one that brings order to what's left? Wanna take a shot at it? I did my best with what I was given. Wanna be King for a day? Give it a whirl, Corporal. I'd like to see how you fare. With the laser sights fading on the weapon, BOWER quickly cranks the power lever, keeping the gun raised- A slow grin spreads across GALLO'S face as he finally looks to him, revealing the thick streams of blood that have dripped from his nose, coating his chin and neck. \nGALLO (CONT`D) Try to imagine it. Imagine... yourself for five minutes without morality. I'll bet you'd surprise even yourself, kid- \nBOWER Shut-up. \n(TO NADIA) What's out there? NADIA shakes her head, rubbing away the sludge from the glass, squinting harder. \nGALLO Imagine... us both. What's left to stop you? I offer you the kingdom and you- \nBOWER \nSHUT-UP- \nGALLO There's still quite a few sleeping beauties down there... a thousand flavors. You up for a little window shopping? \nBOWER Shut-up! \nGALLO (licking his lips) I wanna see it.

And you'll pay for what you've done. Believe me. GALLO chuckles with his face pressed to the floor. \nGALLO A real boy scout, is that it, kiddo? \nBOWER \nHEAR ME ASSHOLE?! NADIA suddenly GASPS... flinching away from the cockpit windows, having just seen what's outside. Her expression is ghostly as she back pedals. \nBOWER (CONT'D) What is it? GALLO looks up with a blood-soaked grin. \nBOWER (CONT'D) What do you see!? \nI \nGALLO You ready for the new world, corporal? BOWER keeps the gun on him as he goes to the windows. NADIA has a ghostly expression, unable to speak. BOWER leans toward the glass, squinting into the darkness and... SWISH! An object moves past the outside of the glass. He leans closer, squinting to see... a school of ALIEN FISH dart past. The shin is underwater. BOWER staggers in shock, back pedalling as GALLO continues to chuckle. \nBOWER \n(DISBELIEF) We've... we've already crashed. We've already... we're... The time-code display rolls centuries past, more then a thousand years accounted for as it finally slows to a stop. \nBLIP... BLIP... BLIP. \nBOWER (CONT'D) We've been... down here... all this time!? All this... time- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (5) BOWER staggers against the console in shock,. the weapon lowering to his side. \nGALLO I guess this thing does land itself. Just doesn't float too well. BOWER lunges towards him and GALLO is ready for this one, quickly countering his move and SLAMMING BOWER into the console. He unleashes a vicious BLOW into BOWER'S throat. BOWER collapses, choking for air and GALLO kicks the gun away. He kneels over BOWER, slowly pulling out a blade. \nG_ALLO (CONT'D) And you thought you could be King!? He slides the blade under BOWER'S neck and... there's a WHIRL of magnetos. He looks up to see NADIA cranking the lever on the energy gun. She tries to turn the gun towards him and... \nI GALLO lunges toward her just as she's able to FIRE! The BLA..ST of energy goes into the console with a CRACK of 1 THUNDER, knocking everyone off their feet. Shattered glass and metal HIT the cockpit window like a spray of shrapnel... \nCLOSE UP .sending a thin crack across the surface of the glass. She struggles to crank the lever again as GALLO charges, hitting the gun away. He SLAMS her over the console. \nGALLO (CONT'D) My apologies. Ladies first... of course. \nANGLE ON/CLOSE UP The crack on the window begins to spiderweb across... \nANGLE ON GALLO grabs her hair to expose her neck and angles the blade upward, forcing her to take a GASP as... BOSSSH! Water explodes through the windows, hitting the room like a hundred fire hoses. GALLO is hit directly and thrown across the room as NADIA and BOWER are engulfed by the blast of black water, sent tumbling. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - CONT. \nThe tremendous ROAR of rushing water rolls them down the stairwell and into the sleep chamber compartment in a raging torrent, a tidal wave slams into the wall.

With no time to defend himself and no where to go... \nSCREECH! The cable is violently tugged from above, jerking BOWER upward, pulling him away from the wall. He spins wildly trying to grab back onto the wall as... \nSCREECH! The cable yanks BOWER upwards with enough force to hit the ceiling and swing toward the open shaft. His fingers claw at the wall as he's literally being reeled in like a fish. He sees the FIGURE charging with a bladed spear. He's knows he's done for and... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) SNAP!

BOWER lays on his back, squirming in the tangled wire as the FIGURE hovers over him, spinning a bladed weapon in his hand. \nBOWER (CONT' D ) Please... don't- Please, listen- The FIGURE slashes BOWER'S sleeve, rips away the fabric and looks at his identification tattoo. BOWER quits squirming as the FIGURE leans closer into the light with a curious frown. TANAKA, a Japanese man in ripped and modified clothing. Unlike the awkward gauntness of the HUNTERS, he has a full- framed, hard-edged physique and soft brown eyes. \nTANA..KA Japanese- No Subtitles \nBOWER What...? \nTANAKA Japanese- No Subtitles \nBOWER I don't understand.

That can't be... you- The SOUNDS remain muffled, deeper within the wall, possibly from inside the ventilation shaft. PAYTON contemplates, eyes panicked. He climbs up the wall and wedges the panel cover over the shaft opening, jamming it closed with a screwdriver. He backs away, gripping the weapon, ready for anything. He tries to control his breathing as he sits... watches... and waits. \nTRAP.

REC ROOM - LATER \nA pin-point of light appears at the end of a circular tunnel. Slowly the light grows as BOWER approaches and cautiously steps through a doorway and into... A rec room with several rows of pool tables, video games and a ran-sacked bar. The floor is heavily littered with broken glass and BOWER wipes his finger across a wet surface on the bar, tasting it with an eye brow raised. \nI BOWER \n(TO HIMSELF) Open bar. Gotta be... E-deck? \nI He climbs over the bar, checks numerous cabinets only to find more broken glass and emptied containers. About to give up, he pops open the last cabinet and... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED : POW! A FIGURE lunges out, a direct HIT under his jaw sends him backwards over a table. The FIGURE jumps on top of him, jabbing a blade toward his neck. He grabs the wrist just as the tip begins to dig into his throat. \nBOWER (CONT'D) \nAAAAARRRRGF! ! A quick struggle ensues and just as BOWER is about to be sliced open... CRACK! The ATTACKER is HIT and sent flying. TANAKA has come to his rescue, twirling a pipe across his palms. The ATTACKER rolls to her feet to reveal... NADIA. She snatches a pool ball off the table and throws it directly into TANAKA'S chest. \nTANAKA \nUUUGH! She rolls across the floor, grabbing her knife and... BOWER BLINDS her with his flashlight, raising the gun with a quick whirl of the energy lever, laser sights flaring brightly. \nBOWER \nHOLD IT! BOWER ducks as a broken bottle WHIZZES past his face, smashing against the wall. He raises the gun and... KA-RAAAACK! A deliberate warning shot goes past NADIA and HITS the bar, SHATTERING every piece of glass that's near by and NADIA and TANAKA are both blown off their feet. \nBOWER (CONT'D) Knock it off! Both of ya! TANAKA and NADIA slowly recover, both quickly try to find their weapons on the floor. \nBOWER (CONT'D) Listen... nobody needs to get hurt here. Both of you just... cool out. And stop throwing that shit. Her eyes dart with uneasiness as she finds her knife. \nBOWER (CONT'D) Let's all just... go easy here.

He senses her meticulous care for the material. \nBOWER You've been living in here? You're... protecting it? \nNADIR It' seems to be the only living thing left on this ship worth protecting. Regardless of the situation, we still have a mission. We've only lost about thirty percent of the specimens, mostly reptilian class. Never was big into snakes anyway. BOWER doesn't share the attempt at humor, wandering towards a darkened digital screen on the wall, displaying a charted graph of the new planet, TANIS. \nBOWER (under his breath) Tanis. \nNADIA (off his look) You couldn't remember? \nBOWER No, I- I didn't remember just how far away it is... until now. This was a hundred and twenty-three year flight. NADIA begins to gather a few items shoving them into a bag.

Even after a few months. I know everything about this vault and its systems... but I still can't remember where I grew up. Or my brother's name. Only pieces... And the training comes back first.

I save 'em for the weekends. BOWER sniffs it with a sneer and tries to break off a piece... hard as a rock. \nNADIA (CONT'D) Do you know how long it would take to turn dehydrated meatloaf into that? \nBOWER How long? \nNADIA I don't know, but it takes more then a couple years to turn coal into fucking diamonds. \nBOWER You think we've over slept? \nNADIA This ship was built to outlast our children's children... and any engineer could tell ya the warranty is running out.

GALLO is tightly wedged inside the shaft, squirming to crawl out, trembling with fear and exhaustion. \nGALLO Help me- I'm part- of the flight crew! I'm- Please- HELP ME! PAYTON oddly hesitates... before lowering the weapon. He digs into the shaft grabbing GALLO'S hand, pulling him out. GALLO collapses onto the floor, crumbling into a fetal position, naked.

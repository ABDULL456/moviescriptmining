BOWER tucks it into a zipper pocket and his photograph falls out. PAYTON watches as he tucks it back in and zips up. \nPAYTON (CONT'D) Wife...? \nBOWER Yeah... I think so. \nPAYTON Must be newlyweds.

VENTILATION SHAFT - MOMENTS LATER \nBOWER squeezes inside, pushing himself forward several feet as PAYTON peeks inside behind him. With one last look, BOWER holds the pen-lamp in his teeth and begins to crawl, pushing himself forward on his stomach, only several inches at a time in a rhythmic motion. Grunt, slide, breath.

BOWER quickly pushes himself forward reaching an intersection in the shaft. \nBOWER (CONT'D) Got an intersection here. \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) What are the choices? The light pans to endless shafts in each direction. He SNAPS a glow stick to life, letting it drop down the vertical shaft... silently into nothing. \nBOWER A whole lot of the same... nothing. \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) If you're gonna take a turn let's keep track. That way you can get back if there's no way out. \nBOWER Don't say that. BOWER lowers his head, breathing heavily. \nPAYTON (ON RADIO) If you haven't seen anything yet... maybe you should head back now.

A SHUDDER that sends a domino effect of metallic CLANKS towards him from below. Small shafts of light break through as small vents open in the side walls. His fingers dig the envelope opener from his pocket as the RUMBLE fades, CLANKING the vents shut just as... He stabs the envelope opener into an open vent. Metal bends.

He sighs, looking down each of the corridors, all appearing identical and endless. \nBOWER (CONT'D) Which way is which? I He examines the piping that runs along the ceiling, checking the direction of the valves and guesses, picking a direction. He walks to the edge of the next corridor and pauses with a frown. Glancing down the side corridor, fifty yards away, something is off. Within the symmetrical framing of steel, there is a rounded shape that is out of place. Be cautiously steps closer as the object takes the shape of... a MAN, standing at the edge of a doorway, head slightly cocked, peeking out. \nBOWER (CONT'D) Hey...!? BOWER freezes, caught in a silent stand-off, the MAN'S motionless stare is unsettling. \nBOWER (CONT'D) Hello...? A low RUMBLE approaches as LIGHTS FLICKER past to reveal... The MAN'S face, hauntingly contorted, swollen features. The MAN is dead, hanging from a cable around his neck, naked and gutted like an animal, his feet hanging an inch off the floor. His face is brutally beaten. \nBOWER (CONT'D) Jesus... Christ.

With the flashlight leading the way he explores into a corner of the room, tangled with pipes. \nSCRAPE... THUMP! Something is just beyond the wall, trying to get in. PAYTON back pedals, searching for any form of a weapon. He SNAPS the handle off a storage bin, wielding it like a baseball bat as he slowly back pedals to the control desk. He continues his search across the radio channels, keeping his eyes toward the corner as... his FINGERS on the switch seem to be TREMBLING with more intensity. \nPAYTON (CONT'D) Bower?

BOWER forces open a single paneled hatch door and cautiously enters into an institutional style mess hall. Hundreds of lunch tables and chairs. Random SPARKS of light erupt from neon lights overhead. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: As he moves across the massive room, the neatly lined rows gradually become more dishevelled, chairs knocked over and unknown liquid dripping from the tables. Garbage litters the floor, a dim glow of light emerging from the galley. He crawls along the edge of the counter and peeks inside the galley, horribly ran-sacked. In the midst of the wreckage, a darkened FIGURE is seen scavenging through the cupboards, angrily tossing empty containers aside. The FIGURE pauses, sensing a presence and glances back as... BOWER ducks. He contemplates, pulling out the envelope opener and slowly peeks back out and... POW! He's HIT in the face, blood spraying, slamming onto his back. The pen-lamp and envelope opener spin across the floor. BOWER tries to get up and he's grabbed by the hair, a blade pressed against his neck. \nI A woman's voice growls into his ear, in German. \nNADIA Keine Bewegung! \nBOWER What-!? He tries to look up and... CRACK! Instant swelling over his eye from a hit. She kicks the envelope opener away. \nNADIA \n(GERMAN ACCENT) Don't move! \nBOWER \n(DAZED) Wait a second- \nNADIA Don't you move MOTHER FUCKER! She quickly pats him down, stealing tools. All he can see is her bare feet, blackened from oil. He frowns to see her toe- nails painted with bright pink polish. NADIA, a torn jump suit, snarled hair hiding her face, skin smeared with oil. A beautiful woman underneath an apocalyptic smear of grunge. Her hair is pure white, high- lighted with smears of oil. \nBOWER Wait- I'm part of the crew! I'm- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) CRACK! A hit silences him and the forceful frisk continues. She pauses to see Evalon's photograph, throwing it aside.

Just listen- I'm not- \nNADIA Take them off! \nBOWER What!? \n", "test2_id": 2503, "test3_input": "(GROWL) Quiet! They look to see TANAKA has fallen behind, crouched and peering off towards the dark. He's poised like a dog on the prowl that's caught a bad scent. They crouch and crawl to the adjacent corner. \nBOWER I don't see what he's looking at, do you? \nNADIA We have to keep moving. We don't want to stay out in the open for too long. Especially in here. \nBOWER \n(TO TANAKA) Hey...? Let's go! Distant THUMPS are heard somewhere in the room and they tighten up with their weapons, eyes scanning. TANAKA refuses to look away, poised like a hunter. \nNADIA We can't stay herel NADIA heads across the main floor and BOWER tries to wave him on, but TANAKA is locked onto something, refusing to waver. \nBOWER Let's get out of here! Com'on- The THUMPS grow louder and TANAKA heads into the shadows. BOWER hesitates, turning to follow NADIA through a barricade of dishevelled equipment, leaving TANAKA behind. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PROCESSING DOCK -CONT. \nBOWER emerges from the barricades into a processing center for loading passengers, darkened and in shambles. NADIA is scanning the corridors ahead, choosing her path as BOWER rushes to catch her. \nBOWER We can't just leave him. We have to wait- \nNADIA Then you wait... and find your own way. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOWER We can't split up the team, it's all \nWE'VE GOT- \nNADIA I told you I'm not going to wait. I'm not gonna get myself killed for- \nBOWER The guy saved my life twice already. I'm not gonna leave him- \nNADIA What do you think he's doing in there!? \nBOWER How the hell should I know- \nNADIA He's hunting! Bagging the next notch on his belt. You wait for him! Good luck. I NADIA quickly heads deeper into the room and down a darkened and narrowing tunnel. BOWER hesitates with frustration. Having to choose, he turns and chases after NADIA. I They crawl through a maze of machinery and NADIA'S pace is difficult for BOWER to keep up. \nBOWER Wait! I'm coming- There's a CRUNCH under his foot. He lowers his light, picking up a small white object. He brings it closer to the light to realize it's... A HUMAN FINGER BONE. \nBOWER (CONT'D) Jesus! NADIA turns toward him to see... \nREVERSE ANGLE Behind BOWER is a massive stack of human skeletons and carcasses. They've just crawled into a pit of human remains. They both back away with horror only to see a mountain of carcasses on both sides. The only route is upward and they begin to crawl up the slope on their bellies, over dead remains. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBOWER (CONT'D) \n(HORRIFIED) My God! Wait- Where are we going!? NADIA suddenly grabs him, a quick jerk to silence him. A SHADOW passes with a CACKLING HISS. They freeze, laying on top of the remains, the bones CRINKLING underneath them. The HISS grows stronger... and they look up to see a silhouetted HUNTER crouched over like a gargoyle on a rafter, leering in their direction. \nNADIA \n(WHISPER) Don't move. They try to remain motionless, but the slope of the remains i CRINKLES underneath them and the hill of remains begins to slide. The HISS grows stronger. They hold their position until... a SHUDDER approaches with FLICKERING LIGHTS. The power surge is enough to ignite a small landslide underneath them. \nBOWER \nSHIT- NADIA grabs his arm as bones snap and they slide helplessly to the bottom within a landslide of bones and flesh. The finally slide to a stop at the bottom of the slope and BOWER quickly raises his weapon towards the rafters to see... the HUNTER is gone. \nNADIA \n(WHISPER) Where... did it go-? He pans the light and... ROAR! The HUNTER lunges at them from five feet away. BOWER is STRUCK with enough force to send him flying, CRASHING into a pile of bones. NADIA spins around with a bladed pipe in her hands... but the HUNTER is already gone. She spins back and... THWAP! She's HIT from behind and sent with break-neck force into the floor. The HUNTER pounces onto her back and a claw-like hand grabs her hair... teeth opening towards her neck and... POW! BOWER charges into the HUNTER, tackling it and they spin into a brutal and distorted fight, seen under the FLICKERING LIGHT. Even though the HUNTER is a smaller one,of the pack, smaller then BOWER, its speed and strength is in- human. It grabs BOWER by the head with a GROWL and... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) THWACK! TANAKA lunges out of the shadows, delivering a blow with his bladed pipe into the HUNTER'S face. It's a hit that would normally kill anything, nearly taking its head off. The HUNTER stumbles, staggers and... HIIIISSSSSST! It HITS TANAKA, sending him airborne, nearly knocking him out. Under the FLICKERING LIGHT, BOWER, NADIA and TANAKA all attack the lone HUNTER, taking all three of them to bring it to the floor. They viciously pound it with pipes and blades until it finally stops flinching beneath them. Its pale white skin seeps a thick black colored blood. The three of them back away, gasping and coated in its blood. \nBOWER \n(GASPING) Jesus... Christ- Jesus- Its face is smashed beyond recognition, but its facial features are horrifically distorted, no sign of eyes under the shredded tissue. \nBOWER (CONT'D) What the... what the hell is it!? The HUNTER flinches and our gang back pedals with fright. NADIA continues back pedalling, looking towards the rafters to see... HEFLIN silhouetted, leering towards them. \nNADIA \nANOTHER ONE- BOWER quickly finds his weapon on the floor and HEFLIN slowly begins to TAP his spear against the wall, echoing a continual clank through the hull. \nBOWER What is he... doing? BOWER, NADIA and TANAKA quickly realize the effect as shadows begin to move.., the room is filling with HUNTERS, alerted by the tapping of metal. \n", "test3_true": "BOWER They're... everywhere- \nNADIA Run! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) A low gargled HISS is heard from HEFLIN'S throat. NADIA is already gone. BOWER and TANAKA chase after her as the walls come to life, HUNTERS swarming onto their path like a pack of wild dogs. Before diving through the barricade, BOWER looks back to see HEFLIN and his pack have paused... to eat the fallen HUNTER. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLEEP CHAMBER/MAIN CORRIDOR - CONT. \nIt's a panicked and mad dash through the dark as they crawl through the barricade and run back into the main corridor of sleep chambers. HUNTERS can be heard closing on their trail. They round a corner and NADIA jumps inside an empty sleep- chamber, frantically trying to pull the hatch closed. TANAKA follows suite, jumping inside another chamber and BOWER scrambles, in search of an open door as footsteps are heard quickly approaching. In a frenzied panic, BOWER dives into the chamber with NADIA, tugging the hatch closed. \nFOLLOW THRU: \nINT. SLEEP CHAMBER - CONT. \nBOWER and NADIA are cheek to cheek in the cramped space, both gasping for breath and dripping sweat with terror. Through the porthole... silhouetted HUNTERS move past with weapons in hand, search and destroy style. One HUNTER steps up only a few feet from their porthole and they freeze, holding their breath. Slowly the HUNTERS continue past, the shadows slowly fading from sight. \nBOWER What the hell happened to them!? What the hell are those things!? \nNADIA Shut-up! They listen for a long moment... hearing nothing as BOWER looks at his hand, finger tips trembling. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLEEPING CHAMBER/MAIN CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER \nThe hatch door inches open and BOWER peeks out. He and NADIA crawl out quietly to see TANAKA waiting for them. \nTANAKA Japanese - No subtitles. \nBOWER I second that. Let's get the fuck out of here. Which way did we come from? \nNADIA You want to go back? \nBOWER No, I mean... let's just go! \nNADIA We should go back. Find a different path. I don't think we can get through to the reactor bay from- \nBOWER You said there was no other path. \nNADIA I'm ready to explore other options- \nBOWER Which way did they go-? \nNADIA You really want to discuss it here!? A RUMBLE is heard approaching and they all crouch in unison. It's a power surge that sends FLICKERING LIGHTS across the massive corridor and a BLINKING LIGHT is activated on a nearby sleep-chamber. And then... BANG! The hatch door is KICKED from the inside, white gas erupting from the seam. Our gang quickly crawls toward the shadows, crouching behind equipment to watch as... Another KICK bursts open the hatch and a BIG PASSENGER crawls out, slamming onto the floor with a shiver of agony, gasping for breath, muscles twitching. \nBIG PASSENGER \nAA.AAAA.RGH ! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The BIG PASSENGER tries to get to his feet, gasping and heaving, mumbling in Russian. BOWER tries to stand but NADIA pulls him back. \nNADIA What are you doing-!? \nBOWER They'll hear him- They'll- We've got to \nHELP HIM- Footsteps thunder across the floor and... WHACK! The BIG PASSENGER is STRUCK by a single blow from HEFLIN. The HUNTERS have returned in full force and they come out of the shadows from every direction, bladed weapons spinning. BOWER pulls away from NADIA'S grip and prepares to intervene, but TANAKA suddenly grabs him, holding him back with force. With the BIG PASSENGER wounded and moaning on the floor, the HUNTERS gather in a circle in ceremonial fashion, praying thanks for the feast the ship has presented. They watch helplessly as the BIG PASSENGER is then brutally attacked and eaten alive. WEASEL leads other HUNTERS under the flickering light in a demented and twisted celebratory dance, a frenzy of pure evil. This attack is heard more then it is seen, under flickering lights, obscured view and most of the camera angles on Bower and the groups reactions. Frozen in horror, BOWER is tugged by TANAKA, following NADIA to the corner where she's lifted a grate in the floor. They climb into a shaft under the floor and into the dark as... The SCREAMS and HISSES echo through the hull. \nFADE THRU BLACK: \nINT.

He hesitates, holding the pipe as a weapon, tucking it away and cautiously approached GALLO for a closer inspection. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He feels his neck for a pulse.

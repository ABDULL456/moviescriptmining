PAUL Our cards, please. 
MILITIAMAN #1 What cards? 
PAUL You have our cards. 
MILITIAMAN #1 No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards? 
PAUL How much? 
MILITIAMAN #1 One thousand francs. 
Then from out of the fog, three Toyota trucks roar up. George Rutagunda, heavily armed, in cut-off shorts and an open shirt, his barrel chest laden with bandoliers, jumps out. 
he Militia man pulls out the ID cards, hands them back. 
MILITIAMAN #1 (CONT'D) apologetic) joke. 
Rutagunda strides over. 
GEORGE Paul. My old friend. 
Paul climbs out, greets George, as a Militia man swings open the doors of the warehouse. They walk in. 
INT. RUTAGANDA'S WAREHOUSE. DAY 
The warehouse is filled with looted televisions, artwork, cars. George points to the stacks of beer. 
GEORGE Everything is double the price now, you do understand that? 
PAUL I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.    G 
EORGE Beer yes, but no whiskey. 
PAUL You have no whiskey? 
GEORGE No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul. 
Paul counts out the Rwandan francs. 
PAUL What do you mean George? GEORGE Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead. PAUL (incredulous) ) You cannot kill them all. 
GEORGE 
Why not? We are half way there already. 
Paul's stomach heaves. He hides it, turns over the money, gets in the van with Gregoire. George comes to the passenger window. EORGE (CONT'D) Let me give you a tip my friend, our generals in the army say 'do not go near the Mille Collines or they will send the Belgian soldiers back here'. But the generals are about to leave, and we will be in charge. It is time to butcher your cow for the meat. (a beat) You can help us Paul. You have some very important traitors at your hotel. The politician Xavier. The liar Benedict. If we were to get them, then maybe we could let one or two cockroaches get away. You understand, Paul. 
Paul says nothing, but Gregoire has been listening very carefully. 
PAUL Let's go. 
GEORGE Take the river road back. It is clear. 
The van takes off. 
INT. VAN. DAWN 
The fog has gotten thicker. They can barely see a yard ahead. 
PAUL Are you sure this is the river road? 
GREGOIRE I saw the sign. 
The van begins to bump erratically. Bump, bump, bump. 
PAUL Stop. You've driven off the road. You'll put us in the river. 
The van jerks to a halt. 
EXT. RIVER ROAD. DAWN 
Paul clambers out, stumbles, falls. 
And discovers he's looking at the face of a dead child, a young Tutsi girl, her hands clasped on her ears as though to block the sound of her own death - an African Munz's Scream. 
Paul clambers to his feet, sees that the van is on a road littered with dead bodies, men, women, children. 
he bumps were dead bodies, the van has driven over them. 
A breeze from the lake blows the fog clear for thirty feet. 
REVEALING: a carpet of bodies, hundreds of them sprawled all along the road as far as Paul can see. Paul wanders stunned among misshapen corpses, made more ghostly by wisps of fog. 
Finally, Paul clambers shell-shocked back into the van. 
PAUL Go back! Go back! 
Gregoire throws the van into reverse. 
hey bump back over the carpet of bodies, each shake and crunch another horror. 
EXT. HOTEL REAR DELIVERY AREA. DAY 
The van pulls up at the rear suppliers entrance. Paul hops out, turns to Gregoire. 
PAUL Tell no one what you saw, do you understand? 
Gregoire, Zozo and the porters begin unloading the van. 
EXT. HOTEL GARDENS. DAY 
Paul wanders to a bench set back in a manicured grove of bushes. Beyond him a crowd of Rwandan refugee children play in the swimming pool, laughing, jumping, splashing like they were at a municipal pool in Central Park. P 
PAUL watches. Tears stream from his eyes, the stream grows into a flood, he buries his face in his hands.

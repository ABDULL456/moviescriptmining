INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY 
O'Connell helps Ardeth Ray mend Jonathan's wound. 
O'CONNELL From now on, don't touch anything. Not a damn thing. Keep your hands off the furniture, got it? 
Jonathan swallows hard and nods vigorously. 
INT. CEMETERY - DAY 
Imhotep prepares the altar while speaking in HEBREW. Beni holds his gun on her, translating: 
BENI Prince Imhotep wants your heart. 
Evelyn blushes, feeling complimented by the handsome prince. 
EVELYN Tell him, I'm truly flattered... but that it's already taken. 
Imhotep continues SPEAKING while laying the four jewel encrusted canopic jars next to the shattered one. 
BENI He wants your heart and your brain, your liver, your kidneys... 
Evelyn's eyes widen. 
BENI ...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach? 
EVELYN Intestines. 
BENI Yeah! Them. 
Evelyn can't believe it, she furiously turns to Imhotep. 
EVELYN You only want me for my organs?! 
Imhotep looks at her and grins, then BACKHANDS her -- WAP! 
Evelyn goes down for the count. Imhotep stares at her, cold, malevolent, then he turns and walks off into the mausoleums. 
Beni nervously glances around, then quickly scurries away. 
TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY 
O'Connell squeezes through a small crevice in a wall and drops to the floor of a dark chamber. He picks up his gunnysack and scans the darkness. Something GLITTERS. Jonathan and Ardeth Ray crawl in behind him. 
O'Connell notices a SHAFT OF LIGHT, high above him, shooting through a small hole in the ceiling and stopping against a wall next to one of those mirror disks. O'Connell aims his gun. FIRES. The bullet STRIKES the disk's pedestal, spinning the mirror into the shaft of light, -- And WHAM! THE SHAFT OF LIGHT HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY BOUNCES AROUND THE ROOM FROM ONE DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP. 
It's an enormous TREASURE CHAMBER. Filled to overflowing. Everything sparkles and shines. The wealth of Egypt. 
O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray are speechless. That's when the two mummified Priest-mummies walk in. 
O'CONNELL Who the hell are these guys? 
ARDETH RAY Priests. Imhotep's priests. 
O'Connell pulls the elephant gun out of his gunny-sack. 
O'CONNELL I never killed a priest before. 
ARDETH RAY They are evil, cursed, they matter not. 
O'CONNELL Well, okay then. 
O'Connell FIRES the elephant gun. SMOKE and FLAME shoot out. 
BLASTS one of the mummies. Blows it's upper torso clean off. 
O'Connell pumps the gun, the huge spent cartridge flips through the air. He FIRES again. BLASTS the other mummy, blows this one's torso clean off as well. The smoke clears. 
The two sets of LEGS keep walking forward, unaffected by the loss of their upper torsos. O'Connell can't believe it. 
O'CONNELL Oh come on, gimme a break here. 
And then the disemboweled upper torsos start to move, turning over and crawling towards our heroes, who start to back away. 
INT. CEMETERY - DAY 
Imhotep turns from the altar as he hears more GUNSHOTS echoing out of the passageways. He angrily reaches into another of Anck-su-namun's canopic jars, pulls out her crusty liver and crushes it to dust, then quickly starts reading a passage from the Book and BLOWS the dust down a passageway. 
IMHOTEP (ancient Egyptian -- subtitled) Kill them! Kill them all! And bring me the Book Of The Living! 
INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY 
A dusty BREEZE blows into the chamber as O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray back away from the mummy pieces. The floor where they were just standing suddenly STARTS TO MOVE. Two more mummies slowly dig their way up out of the floor. More mummies start coming out of the walls and crawling out of the piles of gold. All the mummies head for our heroes. 
O'Connell lifts the elephant gun. Ardeth Ray stops him.

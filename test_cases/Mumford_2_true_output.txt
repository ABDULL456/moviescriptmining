MUMFORD (V.O.) ...In fact, I was jealous of Candy. I wanted to leave too, just like her... get as far away from -- 
Giving up, Mumford slams the medicine cabinet shut and FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HIS STORY BEGAN, WE SEE MUMFORD in his previous incarnation. And this is probably as bad as he ever looked. He stares at his image in the mirror. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) -- me... as possible. 
EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT 
Skip is staring at Mumford. Empty beer bottles are lined up on the porch railing. 
SKIP And so you did... 
Mumford nods. 
SKIP And the drugs? 
MUMFORD Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert... 
INT. DESERT DRUG REHAB CENTER - SUNRISE 
A venetian blind is raised, revealing sunrise over a desert landscape. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) The joint wasn't fancy -- it was run by an order of monks -- but it worked. When I got out of there, I was just about broke... 
EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT 
Mumford gets up from his chair and moves toward his door. 
MUMFORD ...which seemed perfect for starting something new. Be back. 
Mumford goes inside. Skip sits listening to the night. From downstairs, in Lily's apartment, he HEARS A SHOWER GO ON. Mumford comes back out. 
SKIP Somebody's taking a shower down there. 
MUMFORD That'd be Lily. 
SKIP I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day. 
MUMFORD Who'd you go with? (Skip: "alone") That's not good. 
SKIP How'd you do it? (Mumford is confused) The new you. 
MUMFORD You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product. 
SKIP I know it starts with a birth certificate... 
MUMFORD All new people start with that... 
INT. ANONYMOUS WORK ROOM - DAY 
ON A COMPUTER SCREEN an elaborate graphics program is creating the filigreed border of a birth certificate that already bears the official-looking designs of "Green County, State of West Virginia". 
MUMFORD (V.O.) With desktop publishing, you don't have to deal with printers, supply houses, or pesky government agencies. Eventually you do have to get your hands on a typewriter. Ever seen one of those, Skip? 
As the border is completed, we PUSH IN and DISSOLVE THROUGH TO: 
SURFACE OF A DESK, with an electric Smith-Corona typewriter (late '50's vintage). EXTREME CLOSE-UP of the keys hammering out individual letters and numbers: date, hospital, attending physician. 
SKIP (V.O.) (playing along) Is that like a mimeograph?... What about the name? 
EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT 
Mumford looks at Skip. 
MUMFORD What about it? 
SKIP "Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to? 
MUMFORD Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See... 
INT. ANONYMOUS WORK ROOM - DAY 
The typewriter is just pounding out: MICHAEL OLIVER MUM-F-O- R-D. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) ...Mickey Mumford was in Miss Rice's kindergarten class with me. He was killed with his parents in a wreck on their way back from a Steelers game. He was only six years old, which is a real plus, so there's a birth certificate if anyone checks -- but not much else. They died in Pennsylvania, so there's no death certificate in West Virginia... that's also good. 
ON A KITCHEN TABLE, the new birth certificate, now filled out for Michael Mumford, is carefully lifted from a shallow bowl of light tea (the tea bags are nearby). The paper has taken on an aged, sepia look. CUT TO:

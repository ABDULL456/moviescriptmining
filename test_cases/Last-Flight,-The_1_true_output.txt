NIKKI Well, when I was a little girl, I got bumped by a swing. 
CARY How'd you happen to get bumped? 
NIKKI I just walked through the gate. I was only seven. 
CARY Oh, poor dear. Didn't you see it? 
NIKKI I can't see very far. 
CARY Did it hurt? 
NIKKI It made me dizzy all day. 
CARY Well, I guess we can't hold that against her. 
BILL We all make mistakes. 
CARY That's right. Michelangelo painted Adam with a navel. 
Bill and Nikki laugh at this. Suddenly, Nikki grows thoughtful. 
NIKKI All the same, he'd look funny the other way -- even in a painting. 
They all consider this for a moment as a fresh round of drinks arrives. Frink abruptly rises and walks off, presumably to the rest room. 
NIKKI Where's he gone? 
BILL He went off to shave a horse. 
CARY Have you got a husband or anything? 
NIKKI No husband. 
CARY A mother? 
NIKKI Mother, yes. But we haven't met in quite a long time. 
CARY Why not in a long time? 
NIKKI Well, on account of my mother's name was Beulah. Now, you can't have a mother named Beulah. So I changed it to Jane. And that's how it all began. 
An odd CHIMING sound distracts them. They look off to see: 
FRANCIS the narcoleptic, arms folded, asleep in his chair. He awakes with a frown, pulls a pocket watch from inside his jacket, opens it, and looks at it. The chiming ends and he rises without a word and exits. 
AT THE TABLE Nikki watches Francis' exit curiously. Bill waves her off before she can ask: 
BILL He's goin' off to tame an alligator. 
NIKKI Who is he, anyway? 
CARY Francis used to fly with us in the 94th. The best shot in the squadron. Brought down twelve planes. Used to call him "Sudden Death." He lost interest after his teammate got killed. He's lonesome is all. 
NIKKI I like him. 
CARY He carries a chiming watch on account of he's always falling asleep in the daytime. 
NIKKI What kind of chimes? 
CARY Oh, Westminster, Canterbury, and Whittington. 
NIKKI I'll take vanilla. 
Cary puts a fist on his hip and gives Nikki an exasperated look. Taxi horns squeak. Francis, Shep and Frink return from their various adventures and sit down as Bill gives Nikki his opinion of Francis. 
BILL I think he's a washout. 
SHEP Well, just because you're a big bombardier and an All-American-- 
NIKKI (interrupts) All-American what? 
SHEP Halfback. 
FRINK Where? 
CARY Oh, Montana State or somewhere. Idaho or Nebraska or the Carlisle Indians or something. Didn't you never read about Bill? Bronko Bill -- the Alabama Flash? 
Bill grins as Nikki inspects him closely through her lorgnette. 
NIKKI (skeptical) I think it's a forgery. 
Bill's face falls. He looks at Nikki. 
BILL Say! What do you want me to do? Tackle a horse?

{"test1_input": "17 CONTINUED Archie smiles and leaves. The nurse is left with Oliver who avoids her touch, \nNURSE Cut that out, you little spit, \n18 TNT. CORRIDOR Archie stops to hear what the woman has to say. \nWOMAN About the bill, Doctor. Barney is passing by. \nARCHIE Is she okay? \nBARNEY \n(DARKLY) Lunch. Archie looks up at the woman. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 ARCHIE His leg will be fine. Don't worry too much about the bill. Just enough to pay it. \nWOMAN I have money to pay it, A pipe smoking public relations man leads a casually dressed group past Archie and the woman. \nPUBLIC RELATIONS MAN Yea, we had ABC filming a documentary here last week \n19 INT. THE ROARING 20'S CAFE DAY \nAll through the scene Barney and Archie will be served by topless waitresses while other topless waitresses slide down a big brass pole in the centre of the room. As the scene begins Barney is alone, morosely munching a corned beef sandwich. Now Archie appears, threading his way through topless fashion show. A topless ANNOUNCER is doing the fashion commentary into a chrome microphone, as the topless models majestically move about. \n0 19 CONTINUED \nANNOUNCER (no fashion cliche untouched) Springtime in Paree. Our elegante dinner pajamas. In airy aquamarine chiffon and Mediterranean blue peau de soie. Delightfully carefree, yet formal enough for an ambassadorial reception at the Palace of Versailles. \nBARNEY \"Screw you, Wilma.\" Why didn't you tell me? \nARCHIE How is she? \nBARNEY You tell me. \nARCHIE Oh, great, terrific, you wouldn't believe it. Terrific. And her rib? \nBARNEY I taped it. Gave her some seconal. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Should have a vertical just to be safe. A waitress hovers \nARCHIE Why do we have to eat topless? \nBARNEY The best Irish stew in town. He is eating a corned beef sandwich. Archie is ordering the same. \nBARNEY She said you beat her up. Kidding, of course. Archie bites into his sandwich with small enthusiasm. Breasts with their pasties always intrude. \nBARNEY You must have been a little rough on her, daddy. \nE \n19 CONTINUED The second model, a beautiful topless Negress, is now wandering past the tables. The announcer goes on and on. \nANNOUNCER Opening Night at the Opera. Though the curtain has risen on the first act of Aida, all eyes are on the Royal Box, Mi Lady in dazzling velvet: Cardinal Richelieu Rouge. The utter simplicity of her full-length gown is subtly accented by the merest suggestion of gay abandon. Archie eats his sandwich. An off-duty topless waitress sits in the corner having lunch, holding a napkin over her bosom with one hand, while eating with the other. \nBARNEY Archie ? \nARCHIE Barney ? \nBARNEY \n(UNEASILY) You know how long I've known you? \nARCHIE Forever? \nBARNEY That's how long. And Polo and the kids. That's exactly how long. Another silence. Archie is watching the brass pole. Every other girl sliding down looks like Petulia. Archie accepts his hallucination with mild pleasure. Barney will not be stopped. \n", "test1_true": "ARCHIE'S VOICE Barney, for Chrissake, I'm listening to you, \nBARNEY'S VOICE You're thinking about that hot cat in your bed, you bastard. \n19 CONTINUED Now, in the continuous luncheon fashion show, the \"Psychedelic Yvonne\" has appeared, topless amid a wild pattern of lights, The dialogue between Barney and Archie continues elsewhere as the orgy of colors becomes: \n20 INT. HOSPITAL \nThe left side of a patient's face and the right shoulder and arm of the patient's body are sprayed with a special liquid which instantly dries a violent blue and then very quickly starts changing into all the colors of the rainbow. These various colors indicate physical conditions. They are watched, measured, and timed by Archie, Barney and their assistants, \nBARNEY'S VOICE My record is far from spotless, if you don't know that, who does? But baby, it's just not the answer, not at our age. \nARCHIE'S VOICE So what's the answer, baby? \nBARNEY'S VOICE \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Someplace you can belch without saying excuse me! \nARCHIE'S VOICE I can do that in the steam room at the YMCA. \nBARNEY'S VOICE (going right on) And if a little monkey business comes along, whose gonna throw rocks? You and Polo were a marvellous looking couple. \n21 INT. HOSPITAL LEAD ROOM \nThe patient is in a lead room being scanned by an atomic computer. The activator moves in a rhythmic, graceful pattern over the patient's drab, withered body. In the control area Archie and Barney listen to the strange sounds emanating from the computer, each sound again indicating a physical condition. The patient's room looks like a comfy hotel room: wood paneling, couches, magazines, plants. The door leading to outside is three inches thick and solid lead. The noise from the equipment is deafening. \nIS \n21 CONTINUED \n10 BARNEY'S VOICE Is there something wrong with being a groovy looking couple? People turning around to stare? What was it, Archie? The sex bit? Huh? The ole sex bit ,,,? \nARCHIE'S VOICE Barney, what would you say if I told you that one day I just got very tired of being married? \n22 INT. A DECOMPRESSION OPERATING ROOM \nThis is a really glorified pressure chamber where a complete atmosphere is created to suit whatever surgery is going on. The patient can no longer be seen. He is draped in plastic which creates a sub-atmosphere. The doctors and nurses are swathed in plastic, again in the atmosphere that lets them function best, (This is for real. It exists, for instance, at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York.) The doctors and nurses communicate with each other through throat mikes and seem like other world automatons. In all this the patient simply does not exist. The colors are eerie yellows and blues with only occasionally and very impersonally the red of blood, \nBARNEY'S VOICE (he never listens) It's still better than being out there in the dark, all by your goddam lonesome! Nobody has a life anymore. Quicksand, It scares me. What do you want, Archie? \n23 INT. DOCTOR'S GYM \nArchie and Barney are in a white cubicle playing handball. Their dialogue, of course, continues, \nARCHIE \n(GASPING) I don't know what I want. To feel something, \nBARNEY \n(GASPING) That's no answer; Archie, grow up! The ball comes whizzing at Barney who suddenly wants it to hit him, which it does, \nBARNEY Archie, what am I going to do about Wilma? \n24 EXT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENT LATE AFTERNOON \nArchie has just parked his car and is going toward the entrance, when he sees Petulia sitting on a bus-stop bench, the tuba beside her. She is dozing. \nARCHIE \n(SOFTLY) Hey, you. She opens her eyes, smiles. \nPETULIA I'm drunk. \n", "test1_id": 2607, "test2_input": "ARCHIE It's the stuff Barney gave you. \nPETULIA I'm drunk. \nARCHIE I'll drive you home. \nPETULIA Thank you, I'll take the bus. \nARCHIE Don't be silly. \nPETULIA Don't pry, Archie. \nARCHIE How'm I prying? \nPETULIA I'll go home by bus. \nARCHIE If I were prying, I would ask you how you broke your rib. Right? \nPE TULIA You fall on a tuba and you break your rib. Right. \nARCHIE Wrong. The rib was broken hours before your fall. L' During this the bus comes to a stop. Petulia rises shakily to board it but she can't go through the entrance with the tuba. \nCONTINUED \nBUS DRIVER Anytime you're ready, Lady. \nARCHIE I'll keep it for you. \nPETULIA It has to be returned. \"Friends of the Evergreen,\" Archie looks blank. \nPETULIA It's a lodge. In Chinatown. On Grant. Ask for Mr. Howard. The bus driver really leans on his horn to make everything charming. \nARCHIE (shouting above horn) Petulia, take a cab! \nPETULIA (shouting above horn) \nDon't pry, Archie: She groggily enters the bus, leaving the tuba in Archie's arms. \n25 INT. BUS \nPetulia takes a seat at an open window. The bus is now stopped for a moment more by the traffic light. Petulia, under the best of circumstances doesn't make much sense, and now she's quite groggy. \nPETULIA Will you remember that? \"Friends of the Evergreen.\" \nARCHIE Petulia, where are you going? \nPETULIA Mr. Howard. Tell him I'm sorry I goofed. Archie, you know something? The tuba makes you look ten years younger, and . you'know ... Thingy 0 The bus starts with a jolt and Petulia winces in pain. \n26 INT. DANNER HOUSE KITCHEN \nPetulia is wincing with pain as she puts groceries on the shelf. David is watching her, concerned. \nDAVID Petulia? \nPETULIA Hi. \nDAVID You okay? \nPETULIA Uh huh. \nDAVID Sure? \nPETULIA Of course. \n", "test2_true": "I \nPETULIA I'm fine. \nDAVID ... for a split second there \nPETULIA Ism okay. \nDAVID I thought maybe you \nPETULIA David. Somehow or other we begin to sense that madness has entered what is really a commonplace scene. Something has gone wrong and we can't for the life of us under- stand what and before we can even guess, we are: \n27 INT. BUS \nPetulia is still in the bus and we realize she has 0 imagined the foregoing. She gets off the bus. \n28 EXT. THE VERY. MODEST OFFICES OF THE \"FRIENDS OF THE \nEVERGREEN\" DAY. The sign on the door identifies this as a fraternal organization, founded in 1886 for the betterment of man, but the door is securely padlocked for the night. Archie stands there, holding the tuba and feeling stupid. Haplessly, he returns to his car and begins stowing the tuba inside, banging it against his nose in the process. He is a far from happy man. \n29 EXT./INT. A CLUTTERED, MEAN LITTLE KITCIEN \nIN A SLUM HOUSE DAY Petulia is filling the noisy old electric ice box with milk, ice cream and fresh fruit. A man enters from another room. He is a big, sleepy-eyed Mexican. He has just awakened, is wearing his pajama bottoms and is hairy, sweaty and fat. Petulia obviously knows tlleiman, nods hello, to which the man answers a non-committal grunt. He squeezes past Petulia to drink from the sink. He sticks his head under the tap. \nPETULIA (she speaks slowly because he doesn't understand English) I came by to make sure there was enough milk and things. He finds the situation amusing, reaching in past Petulia to grab an orange. There should be a feeling of a possible relationship between Petulia and this man. In the next room a screen door opens and closes. Petulia closes the ice box door and we and she see Oliver and the Woman standing in the doorway. \n30 INT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENT NIGHT \nArchie is doing research at a desk. Working from notes, he is talking into a tape recorder about new techniques in the treatment of arthritis that would not require surgery. This is a moment to glimpse Archie as a thoughtful man. There are a couple of beer bottles nearby. The bed is still unmade. The tuba stands in the corner. \nThe front doorbell rings and Archie crosses over to let in his wife, Polo, a very attractive young matron. \n30 CONTINUED Polo looks about the apartment dubiously, from tuba to unmade bed. She can't keep her eyes off the unmade bed. \nARCHIE (after `awhile ) Hi, Polo. \nPOLO It's very nice. Archie looks at her questioningly. \nPOLO I've never been here before. It's very nice. \nARCHIE Thanks. \nPOLO It's strange, coming into your husband's bachelor apartment for the first time. Feels slightly illegal. Is that a tuba? \nARCHIE That's a tuba. \nPOLO Make a marvelous lamp. \nARCHIE You just had to say it. \nPOLO Predictable Polo. \nARCHIE \"Predictable Polo.\" Has a certain zing. How're the kids? \nPOLO Looking forward to the weekend. Lest I forget She opens her large handbag, takes out a cellophane bag of cookies. \nPOLO As usual, I baked enough for an army. \nARCHIE Okay. \n0 30 CONTINUED \n", "test2_id": 2608, "test3_input": "No hablo ingles. Lo siento. \n74. Continued \nARCHIE Petulia Danner. She gave me this address, The Mexican shakes his head in complete indifference, is already thinking about going back to sleep, and starts closing the door, \nARCHIE She was beaten. Almost to death. Are you Mr. Mendoza? \nMEXICAN \"Mendoza,\" si, \nARCHIE (giving envelope) This is for you, \nMEXICAN Gracia. He starts to open the envelope. It contains a twenty dollar bill, \nARCHIE Can I talk to you for a minute? Mendoza, with no idea what Archie is saying, starts closing the door and pocketing the money. \nARCHIE \nHEYP He pounds on the door. The door opens. The Mexican says in \nSPANISH: \nMEXICAN (in Spanish) I work all night. Go away. He closes the door. Archie pounds on the door again. He hurts his hand. He sucks on the slight wound. He kicks at the door. He crosses around to the front of the house, A negro and a white teenager are passing. \nARCHIE Do either of you fellows speak Spanish? a NEGRO TEENAGER I speak a lot of Polish, if it would be any help, sir. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 74 Continued \nARCHIE I've got to talk with this man in here. A woman was almost beaten to death. \nTEENAGER Here? \nARCHIE Not here. \nTEENAGER You said here, \nNEGRO Almost, but not quite to death, sir? \nARCHIE Yes. \nTEENAGER Here but not quite here? \nARCHIE Listen, just find a cop, huh; \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 NEGRO TEENAGER He'd better speak Polish, sir. I'm on a fantastic Polish kick. The two chase each other down the street yelling \"Da:\" and \"Paderewskii\" and even \"Yawohl;\", etc, Archie looks at the house and then at his car and then at his bruised hand. He's furious\u00e2\u0080\u009e A police car passes'. Archie looks, but somehow can't bring himself to hail it. He wonders why he let the police car pass. He goes back to his car, \n75 INTO INTENSIVE CARE UNIT DAY Archie moves swiftly to the screened cubicle that held Petulia. He goes inside. He stops short. An old man lies in the bed with a rubber stop in his mouth to keep him from swallowing his tongue until he regains consciousness. His false teeth lie on the table beside him. Archie is plunged deeper into the sense of the unreal. \n76 INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM \nPetulia is in a two-bedded room. She has blue Cornflowers and a hairbrush. She is conscious now but looks quite wan. \nI In the next bed is a middle-aged lady looking at T.V. Petulia sees Archie. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 76 Continued \nPETULIA Why weren't you there when I woke up? You better not say you were when the bill comes, Dr. Bollen. \nARCHIE Who is this guy, Mendoza? Why am I always finding you in a different bed? What are you? \nPETULIA Avery sick girl. \nARCHIE Who beat you up? \n", "test3_true": "ARCHIE Nothing happened to my hand. \nPETULIA I love your hands. I want plaster of paris molds for bookcases. Bookends. \nARCHIE Did David beat you up? Was it Mendoza? Why did you send him money? \nPETULIA I'm still very sick. \nARCHIE I don't care. \nOTHER PATIENT This man is a doctor? \nPETULIA The world's best, madame The patient turns her back on the two of them. \nARCHIE Petulia,you're turning me into a nut. Why hasn't David been here? \nPETULIA Ask me questions. \nARCHIE Petulia, is it possible for you to tell the truth about anything? \nREIPULIA \n(DROWSILY) so Mendoza was looking after Oliver for nae She\" s our cleaning lady s \nSISTER \nARCHIE There was no Mrs o Mendoza Z \nPETULIA ' drowsily) I had to have some place for him to stay,, David would never have let e bring him home \nARCHIE Bring who home? \nPETT LIA Iqm beginning to hurt. \nARCHIE Petuliag I don't understand the kind of world you live ina Come on. For Ghri.st$s sake, a pretty young gi.rl9 what the hell is going on, who would lay a hand on you, how could you get so screwed up? Through this Petulia simply lies there, just looking a Archie. \nARCHIE I cans t stand it. \nPETULIA Irm asleep. They gave me a pill.and I' asleep,, Really0 I am really very sleepy,, Can we talk later, Archie? When ivm asleep kiss my forehead. She closes her eyes and sleeps. Archie gives her fore- head a kiss and she giggles. He leaves. \nCHANGE \n75AA \n77 INTO ARCHIEBS APARTMENT NIGHT. Furniture Is pushed back and three pup tents circle the center of the room. Archie and his sons have been having a camp-in. They are all dressed in jeans and sweat shirts and Stevie even wears moccasins - as though they were in the:High Sierras. The remainders of T.V. dinners are scattered around plus. Coke bottles plus their bed rolls from last night. Actually though it :rust: have sounded. like a great idea the two bogs are very bored, Archie,,: though trying to be \"with-it' is far away,, and they sense it. \nSTEVIE. Shouldn't we police the area? \nARCHIE Good idea. Police the area. \nMIKE This is keen, Dad. Water canteens and everything. \nSTEVIE I'm out of water. \n77 CONTINUED \nARCHIE Always make sure you've got water. You'll find some in the kitchen. What's on T.V.? \nSTEVIE I''m hot. In fact. \nARCHIE Switch the fire off then. Stevie goes to switch the electric fireplace off. \n", "test3_id": 2609}

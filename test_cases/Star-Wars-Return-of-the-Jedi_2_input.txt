118  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE 
The two armadas, like their sea-bound ancestors, blast away at each other in individual point-blank confrontations. A Star Destroyer explodes. The Rebel victor limps away, its back half alive with a series of minor explosions. The Rebel cruiser manages to move in next to a second Star Destroyer before it explodes completely, taking the Imperial Star Destroyer with it. The Falcon and several fighters attack one of the larger Imperial ships. 
LANDO Watch out. Squad at .06. 
REBEL PILOT I'm on it, Gold Leader. 
WEDGE Good shot, Red Two. 
LANDO Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down. 
119  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM 
Controllers watch the main viewscreen on which a vague figure of an Imperial walker pilot can be seen. There is a great deal of static and interference. 
HAN/PILOT	 (VO) It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. 
The controllers cheer. 
CONTROL ROOM COMMANDER Send three squads to help. Open the back door. 
SECOND COMMANDER Yes, sir. 
120  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER 
As the door to the bunker opens and the Imperial troops rush out, they're surprised to find themselves surrounded by Rebels, their weapons pointed at them. Ewoks holding bows and arrows appear on the roof of the bunker. The Imperial troops throw down their guns as Han and Chewie rush inside the bunker with explosive charges. 
121  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM 
Han, Chewie, and several troops rush into the control room and plant explosive charges on the control panels and rush out. 
HAN Throw me another charge. 
122  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM 
Vader stalks the low-ceilinged area on the level below the throne, searching for Luke in the semi-darkness, his lightsaber held ready. 
VADER You cannot hide forever, Luke. 
LUKE I will not fight you. 
VADER Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for... 
Vader stops and senses something. Luke shuts his eyes tightly, in anguish. 
VADER Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. 
LUKE Never-r-r! 
Luke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at hisfather with a frenzy we have not seen before. Sparks fly as Luke and Vader fight in the cramped area. Luke's hatred forces Vader to retreat out of the low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft. Each stroke of Luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat. 
The Dark Lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword to block another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader's right hand off at the wrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the mechanical stump. Vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over the edge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. Luke moves over Vader and holds the blade of his sword to the Dark Lord's throat. The Emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased agitation. 
EMPEROR Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! 
Luke looks at his father's mechanical hand, then to his own mechanical, black-gloved hand, and realizes how much he is becoming like his father. He makes the decision for which he has spent a lifetime in preparation. Luke steps back and hurls his lightsaber away. 
LUKE Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. 
The Emperor's glee turns to rage. 
EMPEROR So be it...Jedi. 
123  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER 
Han and several of the fighters run out of the bunker and race across the clearing.

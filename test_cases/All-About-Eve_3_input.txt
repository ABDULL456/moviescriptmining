LLOYD (into phone) Hello...hello, this is Lloyd Richards. Where is Eve? Let me talk to her- 
ROOMING HOUSE 
GIRL She's up in her room, Mr. Richards. I really hate to bother you like this, but the way Eve's been feeling - I'm just worried sick what with her leaving for New Haven tomorrow, and everything... 
RICHARDS' BEDROOM 
LLOYD Tell her not to worry - tell her I'll be right over. 
ROOMING HOUSE 
GIRL I'll tell her, Mr. Richards. 
She hangs up. As she moves from the phone, the ANGLE WIDENS to disclose Eve at the foot of the stairs. The girls smile at each other. They go upstairs, arm in arm. 
RICHARDS' BEDROOM, Karen is still in bed, phone still in her hand. She hangs up, swings her legs out, puts out her cigarette, gets into a robe. The open door and light of the dressing room tell us where Lloyd is. 
Karen walks to the door, starts to say something, changes her mind. She crosses to a table, lights a fresh cigarette, comes back to the door. 
KAREN (finally) Aren't you... broadening the duties of a playwright just a bit? Rushing off in the middle of the night like a country doctor? 
No answer except the opening and closing of drawers. 
KAREN What would you do if, instead of Eve, the leading man had called up to say her was hysterical? 
Still no answer. Her tension increasing, Karen goes back to the table, snubs out the fresh cigarette, then strides swiftly back to the open door. 
KAREN Lloyd, I don't want you to go! 
Now Lloyd appears. He's in flannels, and a sport shirt with no tie. He's confused and guilty and tortured. 
LLOYD I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general- 
KAREN I'm a human being, I've got some! 
LLOYD (goes right on) - and for my feelings in particular! For my play, my career - and now for a frightened, hysterical girl on the eve of her first night in the Theater! 
He goes back into his room. 
KAREN Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done? 
LLOYD Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth! 
KAREN Then tell me this isn't true! That your concern for your play and career is one thing - and that poor frightened hysterical girl another - and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career! 
Lloyd comes out wearing a jacket. He crosses to the door, Karen after him. 
KAREN That first, last, and foremost - your reason for going now is that you want to be with Eve! Three in the morning or high noon - play or no play - wife or no wife! (Lloyd stops at the door) Isn't it true, Lloyd? 
Lloyd goes out. Karen looks after him, despairing. 
EXT. SHUBERT THEATER - NEW HAVEN - DAY 
The theater is but a few doors from the TAFT HOTEL. The marquee announces a new play by Lloyd Richards, presented by Max Fabian, opening tonight. 
Addison and Eve stand before the theater admiring her photo on a lobby display. None of the actors are starred. 
ADDISON'S VOICE To the Theater world - New Haven, Connecticut, is a short stretch of sidewalk between the Shubert Theater and the Taft Hotel, surrounded by what looks very much like a small city. It is here that managers have what are called out of-town openings - which are openings for New Yorkers who want to go out of town... 
They start for the hotel - Eve's arm through Addison's. 
EVE What a day - what a heavenly day... 
ADDISON D-day. 
EVE Just like it. 
ADDISON And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality... 
EVE (grins) Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go... 
ADDISON Are you that sure of tomorrow? 
EVE Aren't you? 
ADDISON Frankly - yes. 
They've arrived in front of the hotel. 
EVE It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one... 
ADDISON All paved with diamonds and gold? 
EVE You know me better than that. 
ADDISON Paved with what, then? 
EVE Stars. 
She goes in. Addison follows her. 
INT. CORRIDOR - TAFT HOTEL - DAY 
Addison accompanies Eve along the corridor to her door.

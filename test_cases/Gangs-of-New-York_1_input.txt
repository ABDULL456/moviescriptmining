AMSTERDAM This mob ever have a proper name? 
JOHNNY We was called after Shang when we was named at all. 
AMSTERDAM We're the Dead Rabbits from now. They were the best. They were history. They were legend, and we'll live up to them. 
CUT TO 
55 EXT. DOCKS/WATERFRONT NIGHT 
Amsterdam sits on an empty pier, watching the ships in the river. There's a SUDDEN RUSTLING NOISE as a NOOSE coils around his neck. 
It's Jenny. She's slipped the SILK Amsterdam gave her close to his throat, and she's TIGHTENING it. Amsterdam starts to resist. Then he sees how's she's looking at him. 
She uses the silk to bring his face closer to hers. She KISSES him. 
AMSTERDAM What's this then? 
JENNY Payment for the silk. 
Then DROPS the silk from his throat and starts to touch him. Then his hands are under her skirt. Then, under the cloudy moonlight, they start to make love.

56 EXT. DOCKS/WATERFRONT NIGHT 
Later. Amsterdam pulls Happy Jack's uniform COAT over Jenny to keep her warm in the chill air. 
JENNY You were waiting for me out here, weren't you? 
AMSTERDAM Maybe I was, yeah. 
JENNY You was that sure of me? 
AMSTERDAM Sure enough to wait, anyway. Waiting don't cost nothing. 
JENNY It don't do to be sure. I could go away just as easy. 
AMSTERDAM Alright. 
He sweeps the coat away from her body, allowing her to leave. 
JENNY I'll say when I want to, not you. 
AMSTERDAM Stay then. (beat; smile) One way or another, I get what I want. 
JENNY (looking at him) Yeah. If it was just a shag you wanted. 
AMSTERDAM You're a gypsy, are you, come to tell my fortune? Go ahead then. Tell me what I'm wanting. 
JENNY You got blood in your eye for someone. 
AMSTERDAM It's just I can't look away, that's all. 
JENNY Who from? 
AMSTERDAM Bill Poole. 
JENNY You better get someone else in your sights. No one's ever taken him. 
AMSTERDAM 'Cause he's mine, that's why. I'll take his one eye, and then the rest of him, piece by small piece. 
JENNY You have a plan for this? You going to raise a militia? I'll wager Bill the Butcher don't even know about you or care if he does. 
AMSTERDAM He'll know about me soon enough. 
JENNY And after the Butcher? 
AMSTERDAM You. 
JENNY Is that so? 
AMSTERDAM You'll be in love with me. 
JENNY Love you? You just had me. You can have a mort any time you want. So why look for more than that. 
AMSTERDAM That's taking love, not giving it. I want it to be just you and me, no one else for either. 
JENNY Why? 
AMSTERDAM 'Cause none of us means nothing in life except one to the other. 
JENNY I don't know I want to mean something, to you or anybody. Can there be good in that? 
He stares at her. 
AMSTERDAM We'll see. 
Jenny pulls the coat tighter around her. 
JENNY It'll take a while if we do. If we ever do. 
AMSTERDAM And what about the meantime? 
JENNY Meantime's business. 
CUT TO 
57 EXT PARADISE SQUARE DAY 
A CROWD gathers in one of the main thoroughfares bisecting the 5 Points. A beefy SPEAKER is making an anti-Irish speech on behalf of James W. Barker, a mayoral candidate supported by Tammany's current rivals, the Know-Nothing Party. Hand-painted signs are everywhere, bearing Barker's unsavory likeness. A couple of BUSKERS provide a musical score for the political spiel.

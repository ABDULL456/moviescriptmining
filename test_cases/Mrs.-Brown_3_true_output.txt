SPEAKER (O.S.) Order!  Order!  ORDER! 
A buzzing silence settles as the house sits for the vote. The COUNTERS approach the chair. 
SPEAKER (CONT'D) Result of the vote to the first reading of the Bill to Disestablish the Irish Church. 
A murmur of excitement from the LIBERALS. 
SPEAKER (CONT'D) Order! 
A beat. 
COUNTER Ayes to the right, three hundred and thirty, noes to the left, two hundred and sixty-five... 
By the time he reaches "sixty-five" his voice is drowned in cheers from the Liberal benches.  DISRAELI and the rest of the front bench sit in stony silence. 
Somewhere on the Liberal back benches, a wild-eyed maverick, DILKE, rises to his feet shouting: 
DILKE Mr Speaker, I table a motion in furtherance of the Bill to Disestablish the Monarchy! 
A roar from the irate TORIES and chaos reigns again. 
SPEAKER Order!  Order!!  ORDER!!! 
INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, LOBBY CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
An hour later the house is empty except for a few straggling MPs hurrying home.  An exhausted DISRAELI stands in the corridor with STANLEY. 
DISRAELI We're going to lose. 
STANLEY You can't know that for sure. 
DISRAELI Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help. (long beat) Where is the old girl? 
STANLEY Who? 
DISRAELI Mrs Brown. 
STANLEY It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular. 
DISRAELI In the press, perhaps. (holding up Punch) But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out. 
STANLEY She's refusing to leave Balmoral. 
DISRAELI What's her excuse this time? 
STANLEY The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity. (beat) You're smiling. 
DISRAELI I was trying to imagine "rather upset." 
The elderly prelate, DEAN WELLSELLY, hurries in through the lobby doors.  DISRAELI puts on a welcoming smile. 
DEAN WELLSELLY Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late. 
DISRAELI Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time. 
DEAN WELLSELLY I came as quickly as I could. 
DISRAELI You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?

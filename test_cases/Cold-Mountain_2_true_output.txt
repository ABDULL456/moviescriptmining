BUTCHER Show some respect -- these nails are making a church. 
ROURKE (hammering) I call this nail: respect the church. 
Ada comes over, carrying a tray of lemonade glasses. Calls up to Inman. 
ADA Hello. 
Inman swings down. He feels the other men staring, burning a hole in his head. 
ADA I'm Ada Monroe. 
INMAN I'm Inman. 
ADA Inman? 
INMAN W. P. Inman. 
ADA W. P. Inman. 
INMAN Repeating a thing doesn't improve it. (shrugs) People call me Inman. 
ADA If you were to take a glass of lemonade your friends might stop staring. Inman. 
INMAN They're not my friends. 
He drops down to ground level, takes the lemonade, scowls at the other guys. They're breaking for lunch and as they make their way to the trestle tables -- they enjoy jostling Inman. 
INMAN Thank you. 
ADA And what do you do? 
INMAN I work wood. Got a piece of land. Mostly work wood. 
ADA Clear fields? 
INMAN (uncomfortable) I can clear a field. 
ADA So, was there something in particular you wished to say to me? 
INMAN (thinks about it) Not that comes to me. (hands back the glass) I'll say thank you for the lemonade. 
And he turns and joins the other men gathering round the tables for lunch. Ada watches him, intrigued. Rourke and co. approach ESCO SWANGER, a known sympathizer with the North, to give him a bad time. 
ROURKE Esco loves the Yankees. 
ESCO I prefer a Yankee to a halfwit. 
Inman arrives just as Rourke points a warning finger at Esco. 
He pushes the finger down to get by. Esco continues: 
ESCO What is it you think you'd be fighting for? 
ROURKE The South. 
ESCO And what's that when it's at home? 
Esco's sons, ELLIS AND ACTON, who're working at the other end of the building, have now arrived at the table. 
ACTON Pop, you causing trouble? 
ESCO No. 
ELLIS That means yes. 
ESCO You cut the wood, you carry the water for good old King Cotton. Now you want to fight for him. Somebody has to explain it to me. 
ACTON (to Rourke and the others) Don't even try. 
The others are desperate to tease Inman. 
BUTCHER How's the lemonade? Sweet? 
Ada, at the lemonade stand again, watches them laughing at Inman, who keeps his head fixed on the table. 
EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT 
INMAN, ON A GURNEY, carried, someone with a cloth to his neck, which is soaked through with blood. They start to run with him, heading for the field hospital, worried that he will die before the wound can be staunched, cauterized. 
Throughout, A STRANGE MUSIC PLAYS, discordant notes jangling: 
EXT. SWANGER FARM. COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY 
-- from A PIANO, lashed to a cart, as it bounces along the lane, passing the Swanger Farm. Sally comes out to look. It's Ada riding next to one of the farmhands, a second boy keeping watch over the piano. Sally goes over. 
SALLY That's a fine looking thing.

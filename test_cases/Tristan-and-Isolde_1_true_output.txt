[Tristan walks off] 
MARKE IÂ’ve never seen him like this before. 
ISOLDE Perhaps someone his own age should speak with him. 
[Marke lets her go. She finds Tristan] 
ISOLDE They believe you are distant. They are worried about you. So am I. 
TRISTAN I can tell. Laughing at the market, holding hands, a caress on the neck when he pours you wine. 
ISOLDE He is my husband. I remember his Kingdom comes before my life. 
TRISTAN Yes well, I must confess I thought you might find more difficulties in performing your duty. 
ISOLDE Am I not permitted a single moment without mourning? Living with this Tristan as you said we must. 
TRISTAN I live in torture thinking of these moments. With every look he gives you I get sicker and sicker. There is a burning in me, I feel on fire and guilt and I can't get rid of either. Does it make you happy to know that? 
ISOLDE The Roman Bridge. I can get to it without being seen. And I will go there anytime to be there with you. 
[All the Leaders meet in Castle Dor to sign a treaty] 
MARKE Welcome bands of Anglia, Rothgar and Orick. Wessex: Kaye and Wictred. 
WICTRED As you will be King and his daughter Queen, does that mean Donnchadh will be coming to the coronation. 
MARKE It does. On the next full moon, all will attend. 
WICTRED A lot can happen in a month 
MARKE Bearing that in mind, and given the instabilities of our new land I shall be naming a second. My sister has raised one, capable of guiding you if the need should arise. He is a man of passion, fierce in battle who has learnt to tame his heart with his head. I give you Tristan of Aragon.

FARGO 
FARGO a screenplay by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen 
The following text fades in over black: 
This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occured. 
FLARE TO WHITE 
FADE IN FROM WHITE 
Slowly the white becomes a barely perceptible image:  white particles wave over a white background.  A snowfall. 
A car bursts through the curtain of snow. 
The car is equipped with a hitch and is towing another car, a brand-new light brown Cutlass Ciera with the pink sales sticker showing in its rear window. 
As the car roars past, leaving snow swirling in their dirft, the title of the film fades in. 
FARGO 
Green highway signs point the way to MOOREHEAD, MINNESOTA/FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA.  The roads for the two cities diverge.  A sign says WELCOME TO NORTH DAKOTA and another just after says NOW ENTERING FARGO, ND, POP. 44,412. 
The car pulls into a Rodeway Inn. 
HOTEL LOBBY 
A man in his early forties, balding and starting to paunch, goes to the reception desk.  The clerk is an older woman. 
CLERK And how are you today, sir? 
MAN Real good now.  I'm checking in - Mr. Anderson. 
The man prints "Jerry Lundega" onto a registration card, then hastily crosses out the last name and starts to print "Anderson." 
As she types into a computer: 
CLERK Okay, Mr. Anderson, and you're still planning on staying with us just the night, then? 
ANDERSON You bet. 
HOTEL ROOM 
The man turns on the TV, which shows the local evening news. 
NEWS ANCHOR - whether they will go to summer camp at all.  Katie Jensen has more. 
KATIE It was supposed to be a project funded by the city council;  it was supposed to benefit those Fargo-Moorehead children who would otherwise not be able to afford to attend a lakeshore summer camp.  But nobody consulted city controller Stu Jacobson... 
CHAIN RESTAURANT 
Anderson sits alone at a table finishing dinner.  Muzak plays.  A middle-aged waitress approaches holding a pot of regular coffee in one hand and decaf in the other. 
WAITRESS Can I warm that up for ya there? 
ANDERSON You bet. 
The man looks at his watch. 
THROUGH A WINDSHIELD 
We are pulling into the snowswept parking lot of a one-story brick building.  Broken neon at the top of the building identifies it as the Jolly Troll Tavern.  A troll, also in neon, holds a champagne glass aloft. 
INSIDE 
The bar is downscale even for this town.  Country music plays on the jukebox. 
Two men are seated in a booth at the back.  One is short, slight, youngish.  The other man is somewhat older, and dour.  The table in front of them is littered with empty long-neck beer bottles.  The ashtray is full. 
Anderson approaches. 
ANDERSON I'm, uh, Jerry Lundegaard - 
YOUNGER MAN You're Jerry Lundegaard? 
JERRY Yah, Shep Proudfoot said - 
YOUNGER MAN Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?

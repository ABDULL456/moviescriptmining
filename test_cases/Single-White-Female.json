{"train": "SINGLE WHITE FEMALE \nScreenplay by \nDon Roos \nAdapted from the novel \nSWF Seeks Same \nby \nJohn Lutz \nCOLUMBIA PICTURES LOGO \nBLACK SCREEN \nOn a black screen, the words (without capital letters in front of the words) : \ncolumbia pictures presents \nand then : \na film by barbet schroeder \nBATHROOM - INTERIOR \nWe don't know if it's day or night. We see a little girl, aged around eight, putting lipstick on her lips. She is wearing earrings and a ring on the middle finger of her right hand. She moves forward and we see another girl about the same age. The first girl puts lipstick on the lips of the second girl. Both girl are smiling. \nMore credits, still without capital letters. \nThe camera moves back and we get a better view of the second girl. The two girls appear to be twins. The first girl takes a powder puff and puts powder on the second girl's cheeks. \nThe two girls look at themselves in the mirror. The camera gives the impression to be located behind the mirror. \nThe first girl gives a kiss on the cheek of the second girl. \nFADE OUT TO BLACK SCREEN \nThe title of the film appears on the black screen. \nThe camera moves and we see, appearing on the right-hand side of the screen : \nBUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nThis building is actually Allison's building, but we don't know it yet. \nCredits resume on the screen. \nThe camera keeps on moving and we see several lit windows. The building itself is a nice building with carvings on the walls. \nThe camera moves backward, giving us a full view of the building. \nAs the camera comes back forward, we hear two voices speaking, one male, one female. They are the voices of Allison \u00abAllie\u00bb Jones and her fianc\u00e9 Sam Rawson. \nSAM (voice over) So how many kids do we want ? \nALLISON (voice over) I dunno. What's the statistical norm ? \nSAM (voice over) You and your statistics. \nAllison laughs \nSAM (voice over) One point two. \nALLISON (voice over) Okay, then I want two point two. \nFade to : \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nSam and Allison are lying on the bed, partly dressed. Sam is holding Allison next to him. They are both about thirty years old. Allison has short red hair, and Sam has brown wavy hair. \nBehind the front of the bed we see the wrought iron of the balcony. The light is very dim in the room, lit only by the street lights and a couple of candles. We hear Allison finishing her last voice over sentence. \nALLISON And I want them to look like you. \nSAM Poor kids. \nEnd of credits. \nSAM So, if I got to be able to drag you away from computer tomorrow, I'll buy you that ring. \nALLISON Sure. So, is this gonna be a real wedding ? \nShe moves a bit away from him, and takes a piece of grapes in a plate lying on the floor. SAM As opposed to a fake one ? \nALLISON You know what I mean, Sam. You've already been through the big ceremony with too hundred people. \nSAM That was the fake one. This is the real one. You can have any kind of wedding you want. Underwater. In and out of a steam room in the wild. Horseback. \nAllison goes back into Sam's arms. \nThe camera moves up from the desk, on which the newspaper is lying, to Allison's face, who is speaking over the telephone. Around her, we see other desks with people working. \nALLISON Oh, yes, that's a promise. Rent-stabilized, so you couldn't come on the lease. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY \nA young butch woman, wearing a leather jacket and a black and white bandana around her head, bangs her fist on the walls of the kitchen. She enters the kitchen, where Allison is sitting at a table. Behind Allison, a nice white stove. The butch girl is carrying a motorcycle helmet in her left hand. In the credits, the butch girl is called \u00abMannish Applicant\u00bb \nTHE BUTCH GIRL Nice... you could really open 'em up. I can't wait to get in here. Are you proper with tools ? ALLISON'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nA young very pretty woman, dressed in a short brown dress, moves around the room and then looks at Allison with a seducing eye. Allison, who is holding some papers in her hand, looks at the departing applicant with an amused eye. \nLater in the same room. Another applicant is walking around the room. She's wearing large glasses, and never stops talking. While she is walking, we hear a camera clicking and we see a camera flashlight across the room. \nTALKATIVE APPLICANT I'm an incest survivor, you know. I haven't remembered the instance yet, but I know it's there somewhere. I just have the sense that I survived something. All my therapists think so. \nShe goes out the room in the hall. Allison is shaking her head behind her back. TALKATIVE APPLICANT Oh God, a kitchen ! I hate kitchens, cooking, cleaning, anything feminine. I mean, it's probably my mother's fault. \nWhile the applicant is going into another room, Allison is writing something on a pad she is holding in her left hand. Underneath the pad is a Polaroid camera, certainly the one we saw the flashlight coming from. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nA nice clear room, with a comfortable vintage-looking couch. \nA young woman is standing in the middle of the room, wearing a white blouse and brown large pants, looking very discreet... too perfect ! \nPERFECT APPLICANT I think this could work. And if you feel the same, please give me a call. \nAllison takes her picture with her Polaroid camera. \nLater. Close-up on the pile of application forms. On the top of the pile, the one concerning the woman we just saw, with her picture stapled in the left top corner of the form. \nAllison is sitting on the couch, looking through the files. She has the file of the last woman in her hand. She stands up and walks to the kitchen. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison picks up the phone and dials the number of the last applicant, whose form is still in her hand. Then she sees Sam's picture on the fridge door. She puts the form on the top of the fridge. Close-up of Sam's picture. \nAllison takes the picture off the fridge door and starts dialing again. \nSAM'S VOICE ON THE PHONE Hello, Sam Rawson. Hello ? \nAllison puts the phone back on its hook on the wall. She sits down on the floor crying, and still holding Sam's picture. She crumples the picture into a small tight ball. \nWe see a pair of foot underneath a long light-grey dress walking in the hall. Allison is still crying. \nThe woman knocks on the kitchen wall. Allison stands up with a start. \nALLISON Oh !... Hi ! \nWe get a full view of the unknown visitor. It's Hedra Carlson. She is wearing a black hat on her long light brown hair. She is carrying a large bag held by a strap across her chest. She looks very sweet and nice. \nHEDRA Hi !... The front door was kind of open. Are you Allison Jones ? \nALLISON Yes... I'm Allie. \nHEDRA Oh, I'm Hedra Carlson. We spoke on the phone this morning. \nShe looks at Allison's face, where we still can see she's been crying. \nHEDRA Are you sure you're okay ? \nALLISON You know what ? I'm not. Would it be all right if you came back tomorrow ? \nHedra starts taking her arm, and then moves away inside the kitchen. \nHEDRA Why don't you just... sit down. \nALLISON No, I'm fine. \nHEDRA I'll make you some tea. \nALLISON I just... I don't think I had lunch, that's all. Hedra tries to get some water at the sink, but just gets a strange noise. \nALLISON It's only this one. The one in the bathroom works. Here... \nShe comes to the sink, and takes a wrench lying by the sink. \nALLISON I use a wrench. \nShe squeezes the water faucet with the wrench. Hedra puts her bag on the floor. Allison keeps on trying to open the faucet with her wrench, but the faucet breaks off and showers both girls. \nHedra bends down to shut the main water tap under the sink. \nThe girls are both all wet. \nALLISON Oh ! Wow !... Wow !... I'm so sorry. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nClose-up on Hedra's dress and Allison's jacket drying on hangers near the open window. \nHEDRA (voice over) If you need a reference, you can call them at Rizzoli. \nHedra gives some papers to Allison, seated on the sofa. Hedra is wearing a red T-shirt and black pants, certainly borrowed from Allison. \nALLISON Excuse me. \nWhen the inner door is completely shut, the outer door slides automatically into shut position. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR DAY \nThe elevator is moving up. \nTHE TENANT Which floor ? \nALLISON Eleven \nThe tenant presses a button on the switchboard by the door. \nHEDRA Fourteen, please. \nThe tenant presses another button. Hedra plays with her keys and smiles to Allison. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison and Hedra move a table out of the room. The table is covered with various objets, and has apparently been used as a desk. When they try to squeeze the table through the door, they upset everything that is on the table down on the floor. They scream and laugh. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison turns the water faucet on, and it seems to be working perfectly. ALLISON Okay. \nHedra is kneeling by the sink, looking at the cupboard underneath the sink. She stands up with an oval metal dish. \nHEDRA Look what I found. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nHedra is kneeling on the floor, cleaning the dish she has found in the kitchen. It shines so well that she can look at herself in it as if it was a mirror. \nClose up on the dish. Beside Hedra's face, we see Allison's face coming to join her. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nHedra, just wearing her underwear, is talking on the phone. HEDRA I'm not sure. Hold on, I'll check. \nSitting on the floor, Allison is painting the old lamp Hedra has found in the basement. An electric fan is working next to her. Hedra puts the dress she is holding on the receiver, and whispers. \nHEDRA Allie, it's Sam. \nAllison shakes her head \u00abNo\u00bb. \nNEW YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY \nNice weather. Busy street, with shops and people. Allison and Hedra are walking, eating ice cream cones. Allison is very elegantly dressed. Hedra is more simply dressed and is still wearing her old black hat. \nHEDRA Where do you guys learn to dress like that ? I mean, it's just so New York. \nALLISON I think you look very comfortable. \nHEDRA Yeah, I never know what looks good. \nNEW YORK - A CLOTHES SHOP - INTERIOR DAY \nHedra comes out of a dressing room, wearing a very elegant red jacket. \nALLISON Oh !... I think that looks nice HEDRA Yes ? \nALLISON But I found this. \nShe gives her a red dress on a hanger, which she was holding out of our view. \nHEDRA Oh ! \nALLISON I think you'd look great with that. \nHEDRA Okay \nHedra takes the dress and looks at it. \nNEW YORK - A SHOE SHOP - INTERIOR DAY We see only Allison's feet and legs. She is sitting on a chair trying on some high-heel shoes. We see Hedra's feet coming toward her. She is also wearing high-heel shoes. \nHEDRA Hey ! What do you think ? \nALLISON I think you should take them. \nAllison takes off the shoes she was trying on. \nHEDRA Oh God, you like them ? \nWe now see both girls' faces. Hedra is taking off the shoes she was wearing. \nALLISON Well, I think they go great with that dress. \nHEDRA You take them \nShe gives her shoes to Allison. \nALLISON Well... \nALLISON (voice over from the corridor) I'm not ready to see you. You're just going on something that's over. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAllison is still on the phone. \nALLISON No, there's nothing to talk about anyway. Sam, there's somebody here right now... \nWe see Hedra's face peeking through the door of her bedroom. \nALLISON All right ?... Okay... Bye. \nShe puts the phone down. Hedra is still peeking behind her bedroom door. \nHEDRA Why don't we order some Chinese ? \nAllison remains two seconds motionless with her hand on the telephone, and then smiles and shakes her head \u00abYes\u00bb. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nThrough the open door of the bathroom, we see Hedra kneeling by the bathtub, and apparently washing something in the bathtub. \nThe phone rings. Hedra rushes out of the bathroom. She is wearing a orange T-shirt, a very large red boxer-short and white slippers. \nANSWERING MACHINE Hi, this is Allison Jones. Please leave a message. Thank you. \nA beep. \nWhile listening to the machine, Hedra picks up a box on the telephone table, takes a sweet out of the box, eats it, and puts the box back on the table \nSAM'S VOICE ON   THE ANSWERING MACHINE Allie, are you   there ?... Allie, pick up. Allie, listen. Please, please   call me back. This is torture for me. I know you need me as   much as I need you. I love you. I'll do anything for you for us to get back together, just call me. \nA click, meaning the end of the call. Hedra presses a button on the answering machine, to erase Sam's message. \nWe hear some yapping coming from the bathroom. Hedra turns her head toward the bathroom. \nHEDRA Buddy ! \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nClose-up shot of Hedra, kneeling by the bathtub and holding a big puppy in her arms. She is rinsing it with mugs of water taken from the bath. \nHEDRA Oh, yes, you're a good clean boy. You're going to cheer her up, are you ? Hmm ? You're going to cheer her up. So she'll let you stay. \nWhile rinsing the puppy, she hugs and kisses it. \nShe hears the front door opening and turns her head around. She says \u00abShhh !\u00bb to the puppy, and whispers some other incomprehensible words to it, then puts it back in the bathtub. \nClose-up of a paper lying near the sink over Hedra's key-ring. The paper is a bill from a shop called \u00abPet Express\u00bb, in New-York. It was paid in cash, and the date is 8/16. It reads : \nYELLOW LAB PUPPY MALE, 6 WEEKS OLD, $ 350,- TAX $ 29,75 \nHedra's hand crumples the bill and puts it in the waste-basket underneath the other items already in the basket. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison enters the apartment. She is wearing a silver-colored raincoat. \nALLISON Yoo-hoo ! \nShe closes the front door. Through the open bathroom door, we see Hedra going from the waste-basket to the bathtub. She takes a towel and wraps it around the puppy, still in the tub. \nAllison puts her keys on the shelf by the door, puts her handbag on the floor, and presses a button on the answering machine. A beep and then : \nANSWERING MACHINE No messages. \nBehind Allison, we see Hedra coming out the bathroom carrying the puppy wrapped in the towel. \nAllison turns around, sees Hedra with the puppy and stops in her tracks. She doesn't seem very happy, almost angry in fact. \nHEDRA I know I shouldn't have, but they were just giving him away... in the market. But they said I could bring him back to-morrow. \nALLISON Well, I hope they meant it. \nHedra sits down on the floor. \nHEDRA Well... his name's Buddy. I had a dog named Buddy when I was little. \nShe gives a kiss to the puppy. She then looks up at Allison's face, which doesn't seem very friendly. \nHEDRA Tomorrow, okay. I promise. \nAllison walks away taking off her raincoat. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nWe hear the puppy yapping. Hedra is sitting on her bed in the dark. She stands up and peeks through the ajar opening of the door. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose-up at Hedra's peeking through the ajar opening of the door. The puppy is still yapping. The door of Allison's bedroom opens and Allison comes out. She is wearing a light pink nightdress. \nShe slowly opens the kitchen door, bends down and picks up the puppy. \nALLISON Oh ! Come on. \nThe outer door opens. Allison bends down to pick up her shopping bags. She opens the inner door and takes the keys Graham is giving her. \nALLISON Friday ? \nGRAHAM That'll be great. I'll make dinner when I get back. \nAllison closes the inner door. ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE ALLISON'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR DAY \nReverse angle shot of Allison closing the elevator inner door. The outer door closes automatically. Allison walks along the hall toward her apartment. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nThe front door opens. Allison bends down to pick up her shopping bags and enters the apartment. The front door closes behind her. She drops her keys on the little shelf by the door. She sees Hedra in the doorway of the living room. Her hair is in a bun. \nALLISON Hey, I thought you'd be at work. \nHEDRA No. \nALLISON Don't tell me we have the same belt. Hedra looks down at her belt. She seems embarrassed by something. \nHEDRA Well... Yeah ... Sorry... Listen, I have to talk to you. \nALLISON You have to see these. Look, cookies for dogs. \nHEDRA Oh, they're great. \nALLISON I had to get them. They're so great. \nHEDRA Can I just talk to you for a second... \nALLISON Buddy ! \nSam enters from the living room with the puppy in his arms. \nHEDRA I tried to let you know. \nSam puts the puppy on the floor. \nALLISON What are you doing here ? Hedy ! \nSAM But no, don't blame Hedy. It's not her fault, okay. \nHedra goes out of the hall into the living room. \nSAM I kind of forced my way in here. I had to see you. Hedra comes back in the hall. \nHEDRA I've got to get out of here now. Unless you need me... \nShe looks back and forth to Allison and Sam, and gets just a \u00abNo\u00bb head-shake as an answer from Allison. \nHEDRA Okay. \nHedra goes out of the apartment and closes the door behind her. \nALLISON Why can't you just leave me alone ? \nAllison takes her shopping bags and goes into the kitchen. \nSAM You've got to talk to me, baby. You just can't pretend I don't exist. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison puts her bags down on a table. \nALLISON Easier that way, Okay ? Is that so hard to try to make it easier on me ? \nSAM But people screw up. People do something wrong. And I was wrong, I admit it. And you just... You cut me off. You don't take my calls. You don't answer my letters. \nALLISON Wait a minute. You lied to me ! If she hadn't called, would I have found out ? I think that's really scary, okay ? Please, if you want to be nice, just stay away. \nSAM Okay. You know, I know that there is something that you just can put back together. I was hoping that this wasn't one of them. \nALLISON Well, I guess it is. And... I didn't get any letter. So, I wasn't trying to punish you by not answering it. I just didn't get it. \nSAM Well, I sent it with the keys. \nALLISON Well, I didn't get those, either. What did it say ? \nSAM Forget the letter. I love you. I can't exist without you. I have no excuse for what I did, Allie. You have to give me a second chance. \nShe goes into his arms. He hugs her. She start crying. \nALLISON You really hurt me, Sam. \nSAM Shhh ! \nALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY \nClose-up on Allison's kitchen window. We see Allison and Sam hugging each other. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE ALLISON'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR DAY \nHedra is standing by the window, with a knee on the heater. She seems very pensive. \nAn old lady comes out of the elevator, and looks at Hedra. Hedra turns her head toward the lady. She picks up her bag, which was sitting on the heater beside her, and moves away from the window. She goes to the elevator and presses the call button. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nWithout switching the lights on, Allison puts her mail on a chest of drawers. \nHEDRA Where the hell have you been ? Allison gasps at that somber voice in the dark. Hedra switches the bed-light on. She is sitting on Allison's bed, with her legs covered by the sheet, and the puppy on her laps. She is wearing her night-dress, with a pink sweater on her shoulders. \nALLISON God, Hedy, what are you doing in my room ? \nHEDRA I've been waiting since six o'clock last night to hear from you. I'm worried sick. Buddy was crying. I thought I might as well come in here, so it calm down. \nALLISON Sorry, I guess I just didn't think. \nHEDRA No, you didn't. There's such a thing as a phone, you know. This is New York. Things happen. \nALLISON Okay, okay, I'm sorry. It was thoughtless, really. You're making me feel like I'm sixteen years old here. \nShe goes to the bed where Hedra is stroking absently the puppy. She kneels down at the bedside. \nALLISON Hey, are you okay ? \nHEDRA Yeah... Yeah. Just... forget it. So, I guess you've patched things up with Sam, huh ? \nALLISON Yeah... Yeah, I made him suffer. \nHedra looks down at Allison hand stroking the puppy. \nHEDRA Is that an engagement ring ? \nAllison stands up. \nALLISON Right. \nHedra sighs, and moves the sheet away to get out of the bed. \nHEDRA Beautiful ring. \nALLISON Thanks. \nHedra walks away from the bed. She gives a last look at Allison's ring. \nHEDRA Really great. She walks to the door. \nHEDRA I'm sure you'll be very happy ... you'll be very happy and I'll be alone. \nALLISON No, no, wait a little. You'll find someone, Hedy. I mean, God, if I can... \nHedra is standing in the doorway and points to the mirror. \nHEDRA Why don't you look in the mirror ?... Huh ? Look ! \nShe comes back into the bedroom. She forces Allison to look at both of them in the mirror. \nHEDRA Look ! You're in a different league. I know that. You have this great personality. You have this great style. You're running your own business. You're always going to find someone. You'd have to be stupid to think that you wouldn't. \nShe puts her head in her hand. \nHEDRA Well, I guess you... you and Sam want to be together. So... I have to move out, right ?... No ? \nALLISON Well, anyway, Sam's going to keep his place for a while. I know you just spent a lot on furniture. \nHEDRA Yeah, your timing is great, Allie, it's really great ! You promised me this wouldn't happen. Exactly what... \nALLISON Nothing's happened, Hedy, come on. Look, I'll talk to Sam. Well... Well, maybe we'll move, I don't know. Maybe, we'll find some place like this, or... I don't know. But, we'll see, we'll figure something out. Okay ? \nFONTANA FASHIONS OFFICE - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nFontana Fashions is Mitchell Myerson's company. \nClose-up on some feminine hands typing on an Apple computer keyboard. We see various windows, showing models of female dress, opening and closing on the screen. \nMITCHELL (voice over) They tell me they're nervous. \nALLISON (voice over) Of course, they're nervous. They're salesmen. They want to be sold. We see the whole room. It is a very big room with large white columns supporting the ceiling, and large bay windows. \nGirls are working in the background. Some are trying a new dress on a model girl. Mitchell's assistant is typing on the computer, with Allison standing near her. Her name is Barbara, and she is a woman with brown hair and a sleek bob haircut. Mitchell is standing a couple of feet away. \nALLISON Let's set up a demo, to show them something. Something special, something different, you know. Maybe at night, you know. Open bar, open minds. That's \u00abF\u00bb night. \nMitchell walks to the desk next to Barbara's one, where he starts flipping the cards of a Rolodex. \nMITCHELL I'll set it up, I'll set it up. Maybe I... I'll call you tonight after I check on some things. ALLISON Great. \nHe takes a card from the Rolodex. \nMITCHELL \u00ab8796, Knox\u00bb. Knox ? What's this Knox ? \nALLISON Oh no, that's Graham Knox. He is my upstair neighbor. That was just for last night. Oh, he's the first one. \nMITCHELL Well, I've got to admit, I'm very impressed. \nALLISON Well, maybe you start spreading the word. \nMITCHELL You know, I can see I'm not going to be able to afford you any more. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose-up of Allison's face, looking slightly frightened. She puts the puppy on the floor. \nReverse angle shot on the mirror in Hedra's bedroom. We see Hedra sitting up on her bed. \nAllison runs through the hall towards her bedroom. The puppy follows her, but she shuts the door before it can gets in the room. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAllison jumps into her bed and lies down. We can hear the puppy yapping behind the door. Allison hears the door opening. She puts her head on the pillow, closes her eyes and pretends she is asleep. \nHedra walks slowly across the room towards the bed. She is wearing her night gown. \nWe see Allison's shoulder moving slowly up and down, just as she was really asleep. \nHedra remains a few seconds looking at Allison, then starts walking back towards the door. \nClose-up shot on Allison's face. Her eyes are closed, but, when she hears the door closing, she opens them again. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nSam is fixing a broken piece of wrought iron on the balustrade on the balcony. He is screwing a sleeve clamp to fix the broken piece on the main body of the balustrade. \nHEDRA (voice over) They're ready. \nSAM Right, just a minute. \nHedra is coming out of the kitchen with a frying pan. She is just wearing her night gown. She is stirring some scrambled eggs in the pan. \nHEDRA They'll get cold. \nShe eats a piece of crispy bacon out of the pan. \nSAM All right, all right. \nSam climbs out of the balcony. \nA wider shot shows Hedra back in the kitchen, cooking something on the stove. Sam slides the window down, and then walks across the room and into the kitchen. The puppy gets out of its basket and follows him. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison gets out of her bedroom, fully dressed and ready to go to work. She hears voices coming out of the kitchen. \nSAM (voice over) No, no, Rawson is a Norse name. \nAllison opens the kitchen door. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY \nSam and Hedra are eating breakfast seated on either side of the small kitchen table. The puppy is eating something off the floor. \nSAM (finishing the sentence he was saying in voice over while Allison was opening the door) Well, isn't this a thoroughly uninteresting conversation. \nHe looks up at Allison entering the room \nSAM Hey ! \nHEDRA Hi ! \nALLISON We going ? \nShe walks to the sink, and picks up an orange. Sam gives her a kiss on the cheek. She turns her head and doesn't respond to the kiss. \nHedra comes toward them with a plate in her hand. She gives the plate to Allison. \nHEDRA Scrambled or fried ? \nAllison doesn't take the plate and shows her the orange. She seems quite upset. \nALLISON (whispering) This is fine. \nShe gets out of the kitchen. Sam turns his head towards Hedra and then follows Allison. \nHedra walks a couple of steps towards the open door and listen to the conversation going on in the living room SAM (voice over) Allie, sweetheart, this isn't all that urgent. You know, if you don't want to do this apartment thing today, it can wait till I get back. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nHedra is standing in the doorway leading to the kitchen, with the plate still in her hand. \nReverse angle shot on the legs of Allison and Sam.

She takes a piece of bacon out of the plate and shows it to the puppy. \nReverse angle shot on Allison and Sam. \nThe puppy doesn't respond at all to Hedra's call and food. \nHEDRA (voice over) Come on, three's a crowd, sweetie. \nReverse angle shot showing what the woman sees from her balcony.

Allison opens it. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison rushes into the apartment, followed by Sam. \nALLISON (yelling) Hedy ! \nShe runs past the kitchen door. We see Hedra sitting at the kitchen table. She stands up when she sees Allison. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison stops in front of the window. The window is open and the broken piece of wrought iron, on which Sam was working earlier in the morning, is missing, leaving a gap in the balustrade, a gap wide enough for a puppy dog to go through. \nALLISON (screaming and crying) He's dead ! Buddy's dead ! \nSam climbs on the balcony. \nClose up on the gap in the balustrade. \nHEDRA What ? \nHedra seems genuinely surprised. She still has the earphones of her Walkman around her neck. \nALLISON (crying) You left the window open. How could you do that ? \nHEDRA But I thought we could leave it open. I know you fixed it this morning. \nSam is still on the balcony, looking at the balustrade. \nSAM I thought I did. \nHEDRA It's me. I interrupted you when I called you in for breakfast. And Allie, it's my fault. \nShe starts crying. Allison rushes out the room. \nHEDRA Allie ! \nSAM (voice over) Allie ! \nSam runs out of the room after Allison. \nSAM Allie ! \nHedra walks to the balcony and slowly slides the window down. \nFade out. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAllison is lying in her bed with the sheet up to her neck. Sam bends over her and gives her a light tender kiss on the lips. Then he stands up. We hear him leaving the room and closing the door. Allison turns her head with her eyes still closes. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT \nHedra is sitting on the floor in the dark, leaning on the wall. She is sorting things and putting them in a box in front of her. Hearing the musical noise of a plastic toy, we understand she is putting the puppy's stuff away. \nSam comes out of Allison's room and, walking in the hall in front of the kitchen open door, stops and looks at her. \nSAM Thanks, that pill helped. \nHEDRA Are you still going on that trip tomorrow ? \nSAM Well, she wants me to. \nHEDRA If I'd just let you finish your work this morning... \nWe can hear repressed tears in her voice. Then she starts crying for real. \nSAM Listen, if she blames anybody, she blames me, huh ? \nSam kneels down. \nSAM Shh ! \nSam takes her in his arms where she goes on crying. He slowly stands up, still holding her in his arms. He leads her to her room. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT \nOutside Hedra's room. Sam is in the doorway. Hedra moves slightly away from him and then hugs him even stronger. \nGently, he pushes her away from him. They almost kiss on the mouth, but Sam takes her arms off his neck and goes out of her room, where she stays. He closes the door behind him, and she holds his hand on the doorknob. Then she moves her hand away and the door closes. We hear her sobbing behind the closed door. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison is asleep on her bed, dressed with a short black slip and black panty hoses. \nThe phone rings. Allison wakes up slowly, and, with her eyes still closed, feels around on the night table to find the phone. She eventually picks it up. ALLISON Hello ?... Hi, Mitch... \nShe raises her head. \nALLISON What ? \nALLISON Thank you... please. \nHedra seems to be worried by Allison's very cold reaction to her \u00absurprise\u00bb. She seems even a bit sad. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison is looking at the dresses hanging in the closet. \nHEDRA (voice over) I'm going to take a shower. \nAllison walks out of her room into the hall. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nThrough the open door of the bathroom, we see Hedra turing the water faucet on in the shower cubicle, then taking her belt off. She closes the door of the bathroom. \nAllison stealthily runs into Hedra's bedroom. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison enters the room, and looks around. She walks to the closet and starts looking through Hedra's clothes. Suddenly, she notices the shoebox on the shelf above the clothes. \nClose up on the shoebox and then on Allison's hand picking it up. \nAllison opens the shoebox. She sits down on the bed, and starts looking through the content of the box. She takes several papers out of the box and looks more closely at them. \nClose-up on the documents Allison is looking through. Several photographs, and then a black and white photograph of two twin girls with a puppy between them. The twin girls are the one we saw at the very beginning of the film. \nAllison looks very attentively at the picture. She puts the documents she is holding into the lid of the box and starts looking at the rest of the documents. Close-up on an envelope that reads : \nELLEN BESCH 441 OCEANSIDE EAST TAMPA, FLA \nAllison seems surprised by the name on the envelope. \nALLISON Ellen Besch... \nShe looks through all the other envelopes. On another envelope, a computer-generated label has been glued on the original Ellen Besch address. It reads : \nAUTOMATED MAIL PO BOX NEW YORK PO BOX 72810 c/o 845 W. 93RD ST NEW YORK NY 10024 \nShe puts the envelopes back into the box, and picks up other documents. They are newspapers clippings. \nClose-up on the clipping Allison is holding. There is a picture of two young twin girls, and above, a title that reads : \nNINE-YEAR-OLD BESCH TWIN DROWNS AT FAMILY PICNIC \nAnd underneath : \nServices were held Friday at Hope Lutheran Church for nine-year old, Judy Besch, of Mapic Drive, who drowned Tuesday at a family picnic. Circumstances surrounding her death remain unclear. A eulogy was delivered by Dr. William Starr, the family's doctor for many years. Among the \nShe puts the clippings back into the box and picks up another envelope. \nClose-up on the envelope, which reads : \nALLIE JONES 768 W. 74TH ST. #1103 NEW YORK, NY 10017 \nALLISON (voice over) Sam ! \nWe see Allison's hand looking inside the already opened envelope and taking a key-ring out. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY Close-up on Hedra's hand turning the water faucet off. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison is reading the letter which was with the keys. \nClose-up shot on the letter. It was written on a Hotel Atherton stationery. The close-up is too close for us to be able to read all the words, but we still can read : \nDEAR ALLIE, \nI KNOW HOW MUCH I HU AND I KNOW HOW LITTLE MY CAN DO TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT. BUT PLEASE FOR THE SAKE WHAT WE HAD, GIVE ME THE CHANCE TO SAY THEM. YOU FORGIVE ME, MAYBE I TOO. I NEVER WILL, IF WHAT I'VE HAS RUINED EVERYTHING. I'LL CALL YOU IN A FEW DAYS,IF I DON'T HEAR FROM YOU. I LOVE YOU, ALLIE SAM DAY YOU GAVE ME I'M \nAllison reads the letter very attentively. Suddenly she hears some noise coming from the bathroom and turns her head towards the noise. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nThe bathroom door is opening slowly \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison puts the letter back in the envelope, the envelope back into the box. She then puts everything back into the box, closes the box and puts it back on the shelf. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison comes out of her bedroom, picks up her handbag and starts unlocking the safety chains and locks on the front door, while, through the open bathroom door, we see Hedra, wearing a long white shirt, taking care of her hair in front of the mirror. \nHEDRA Do you want me to fix you something before I go ? \nALLISON Oh, no, thanks. I'm just going up and visit Graham. \nHEDRA Okay. \nALLISON Okay. HEDRA I love myself like this. \nALLISON Have fun. \nHEDRA Yes. \nJIM Yes. \nAllison is staring at the couple \nHEDRA (voice over) Yeah, you look like my sister's boyfriend. \nJim laughs. \nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nWe hear the first sentence said by Graham in voice over the previous sequence. \nGRAHAM Jesus, Allie, what is it ? \nGraham is opening his front door to Allie, who enters the apartment, but stays near the open front door. \nALLISON God, you've got to help me, Graham. You've got to tell me what to do. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT \nHedra opens the front door and enters the apartment. \nHEDRA Allie ? \nShe closes the door and locks it. \nHEDRA I'm home. \nShe drops her keys on the shelf near the door and crosses the hall. \nThe camera moves into the living room. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThrough the open door to the kitchen, we see Hedra crossing the kitchen to go into the living room. \nHEDRA Allie ? \nShe seems slightly drunk and doesn't control her movements very well. Before entering the living room, she takes a blue bag in the kitchen (maybe something to eat) and drops it on a table. But, being a bit nervous, she actually drops the bag on a small bowl containing various objects, and the bowl falls on the floor and breaks into pieces. \nHEDRA Allie ? \nHedra looks at the fallen bowl and bends down to pick up the debris. \nHEDRA God... \nThe bowl has fallen near the air vent. It is exactly the same as the one which, earlier in the film, had enabled Graham to hear Sam and Allison's conversation. \nHedra kneels down to gather the pieces of the broken bowl. We hear a faint voice. Hedra raises her head, trying to find out where this faint voice comes from. \nFirst, we don't understand the words the faint voice is saying, then it becomes clearer. It's Allison's voice speaking to Graham in his apartment. \nALLISON (voice over from the air vent) It's like looking at myself. And she lies. I found a shoebox in her room. \nHedra understands that the voice is coming from the air vent, and she moves closer to it. \nALLISON (voice over from the air vent) Nothing she told me is true. The twin that she said died at birth. It was in an accident when she was nine. \nHedra moves a brass knob on the air vent, to open it wider and to have a better understanding of the words. \nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nGraham and Allison are sitting on a couch. Graham has a glass in his hand, and Allison a cup. \nALLISON And she stole a letter that Sam wrote me. I have to do something. Graham gets up from the couch. \nGRAHAM Get rid of her. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nHedra is still kneeling on the floor, with her ear close to the air vent, listening to the conversation between Allison and Graham. \nGRAHAM (voice over from the air vent) Call the police if you have to. If she steals thing you have to get her out of the place. \nWe hear steps. Hedra looks up at the ceiling, and then slowly stands up. \nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nGraham is pouring something we don't see in a glass. \nALLISON You're right. I'll tell her tonight. \nAllison gets up from the couch, with her cup in her hand. \nALLISON I can't just throw her out on the street. I mean, she obviously needs help. \nGRAHAM She is a lunatic, Allie. She's got to go. Do it tonight. \nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose-up on the front door. The door slowly opens and a hand covered by a black glove comes through the opening of the door. We hear the conversation going on between Graham and Allison. \nALLISON (voice over) It's just that I feel responsible for her somehow. I'm the only one she has. Someone like her parent. \nWe hear a little noise, and we see Allison turning her head. \nClose up on a mirror-covered door opening slowly. At that very moment, we, the spectators, do think we are still in Allison's apartment. But actually, we are in : \nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe door opens slowly with a light squeaking noise. We hear Graham's voice talking on the telephone in the next room. \nGRAHAM (voice over) This is serious, it's a lot more serious than I thought. No, I know you can't diagnose over the phone. \nThe camera moves away from the door, then looks into the living- room, where Graham is sitting in the dark, only lit by the street lights coming through the window, and talking in the telephone. \nGRAHAM I don't know. I don't even know what hyper-vigilant is. No, I've never met the woman. She could be infantile or paranoid, whatever. I don't know... \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose-up on the air-vent. We see Allison's hands sticking pieces of large adhesive tape on the air-vent. We hear the faint voice of Graham still talking on the telephone, but we don't understand the words. \nLarger shot of Allison sitting on her bed and sticking the pieces of tape on the air-vent. \nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nGraham is still talking on the phone. \nGRAHAM I tell you what, let me go downstairs. If I call you from there, will you talk to my friend ? She can tell you better than I can. Right, okay. \nWe hear some noise in the background, and Graham turns his head towards the noise. \nQuick reverse angle shot on the corridor seen from the living-room door. It looks empty and quiet. \nBack to Graham on the phone. GRAHAM Thanks. So... so, all right... so, so you might hear from us. Love to Jack. And you're not charging me for this. \nHe puts the telephone down on his set on the table, turns his head again in the direction where he heard the strange noise, and gets up. He thinks it may be the cat and calls her with a soft gentle voice. \nGRAHAM Carmen... \nHe gets out of the room into the corridor. \nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nGraham makes little noises with his lips to attract the cat. He suddenly hears the wooden floor squeak behind him. He turns his head. \nWe see Hedra coming out of a room and walking towards the front door. Since we see only the back of her head, she can easily be mistaken for Allison. \nGRAHAM Allie ! \nShe doesn't turn her head and just wave her hand. \nHEDRA Goodnight. \nShe has almost reached the front door, when Graham realizes that something is queer about the girl's attitude. \nGRAHAM Hedy ? She turns around. She seems very panicky suddenly. She starts fumbling with the locks of the door, and drops the safety bar on the floor. \nHEDRA I'm sorry... \nGRAHAM Wait... hey, wait, it's okay. Take it easy. Take it... We just want to get you some help. \nHedra is kneeling down, fumbling with the fallen safety bar. \nHEDRA No, Please... Please... I didn't do anything wrong. \nGraham is walking slowly towards her. \nGRAHAM Okay, take it easy. HEDRA I'm sorry, I didn't do anything. \nGRAHAM No problem. \nHedra suddenly stands up with the safety bar held firmly in both hands. She strikes Graham first in the stomach, then, as he doubles up with pain, she strikes him again on the shoulder. Graham falls on the floor, and she gives him a final blow on the head, leaving him unconscious on the floor. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAllison is standing by the desk, talking on the telephone and holding the telephone set with her other hand. We hear a beep. \nALLISON Hello, Mr. Besch, you don't know me, my name is Allison Jones. I think my room-mate Hedra is your daughter. Ellen. I'm not sure, really. She's... She's been under a lot of stress lately... And... Well... Huh... Huh... God... I really, really would not get into this on the answering machine. Could you please give me a call ? Or her ? I'm sure you have the phone number. It's 2-1-2-5-5-5-9-8-1-4. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe front door opens, and Hedra comes in. \nALLISON (voice over, still talking on the telephone) I'll really appreciate, I'll really. Don't say I called. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAllison, still on the phone, turns her head towards the front hall. ALLISON Oh, thank you. \nShe puts the phone down. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT \nHedra closes the front door and walks slowly across the hall \nALLISON (voice over) Hedy ? \nHEDRA (with a deep menacing voice) Don't call here again. \nHEDRA'S FATHER (voice over on the telephone) Ellen, listen. We'll stop sending the cheques if you don't come. I promise, no doctors this time. Just come. \nHedra puts the telephone down. She doesn't move for a couple of seconds, then looks at Allison, trying to look more casual than she actually is. She has a little nervous laugh. HEDRA Obscene phone call. New York ! \nThe phone rings again. Hedra picks up the receiver and slams it on the table. Then she presses on a button on the telephone set to cut off the communication. \nHEDRA Find someone else, jerk ! \nAllison walks to the telephone table. \nALLISON I'm expecting a call from Sam. He might be coming in tonight. \nHEDRA Just for a little while, okay. Sam will call back if it's busy. \nHedra hugs Allison. HEDRA I'm sorry, Allie. \nShe moves away from Allison, looking falsely casual. \nHEDRA It's no big deal. I'll find some other place. You know, I just... I don't want you making a mistake. \nALLISON I understand. Hey, we'll still be friends. We'll keep in touch. \nHEDRA Sure. \nAllison walks away to her room. \nHedra picks up the telephone set from the little table, without putting the receiver back on its hook. We hear several short beeps coming from the telephone. With one nervous movement, Hedra tears the cord off the wall socket. Then she walks slowly into her room. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nA little later. Hedra is lying in her bed, writing something in a notebook. She is humming a song. Her other hand is resting on the telephone set on the bed. \nThe phone rings. Hedra picks it up immediately, not to let it ring more than once. \nHEDRA (whispering) Hello ? \nSAM (voice over on the phone) Allie ? HEDRA No, it's Hedy. \nHOTEL ATHERTON - A BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nSam is lying on the bed, still dressed in his suit and necktie. He is talking on the telephone. \nHEDRA (voice over on the phone) Where are you ? Where are you ? \nSAM Oh... I just got in from the airport. Is she asleep ? \nHEDRA (voice over on the phone) Yeah... \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nHedra gives a quick look at the clock on the night table. HEDRA It's after two. Do you want me to wake her ? \nSAM (voice over on the phone) No, tell her to surprise me. \nHOTEL ATHERTON - A BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nHEDRA (voice over on the phone) Okay. \nSAM Okay. \nHEDRA (voice over on the phone) Okay, I'll tell her. \nSAM Goodnight, honey. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nHEDRA Goodnight, Sam. Sleep well. \nShe slowly puts the phone down and plays a little with it. \nHOTEL ATHERTON - MAIN ENTRANCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nClose up on a pair of female legs and feet with stiletto heels shoes. \nThe heels clicks on the sidewalk, and we see the figure of a woman walking away from us, and towards the entrance of the hotel. No one else is in the streets at this time of the night. The woman is wearing a grey raincoat. \nThe woman enters the hotel. HOTEL ATHERTON - A BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nSam is sleeping, covered by the sheet up to his waist, and apparently naked underneath. \nThe door opens slowly. The woman in the grey raincoat enters the room. We have already guessed she is Hedra. \nShe closes the door and puts the key on the night table. \nShe remains motionless for a couple of seconds, looking at Sam, then she slowly starts to take the raincoat off. She is completely naked under the raincoat. \nShe slides under the sheet of the bed, close to Sam. Sam moans in his sleep. He turns slowly towards Hedra, who starts kissing him on the chest. \nSAM (sleepy voice) Allie, Allie... what are you doing ? Hedra goes down Sam's body, still kissing him. When she gets between his legs, even if the room is very dark, we understand she is performing oral sex on him. \nSam moans with pleasure. \nHEDRA I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, I know you want to save face. I won't tell her, okay ? Just... Just pick up the phone and call her and tell her you're going back to your ex-wife, or something. And I won't say a word, okay ? \nSAM Yeah... Well, you won't have to say a word, sweetheart, because I'm going to tell her myself. \nHe walks to the night-table and picks up the telephone. She throws one of her shoes towards him. The shoe hits the wall just above his head. \nHEDRA (yelling) No ! \nHe rushes towards her, ready to hit her. \nSAM Fucking bitch ! \nBut, before he reaches her, she strikes him very hard in the face with her other shoe. The stiletto heel of the shoe enters his left eye, and, behind the eye, certainly enters his skull and his brain, because, instantly after the blow, Sam falls heavily on his back on the floor, where he remains motionless and unconscious. \nWith her bare foot, Hedra touches his cheek. \nHEDRA (softly) Hey !... Hey ! \nHOTEL ATHERTON - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose up on Hedra's feet walking on the rug. She's wearing both of her stiletto heels shoes. \nHedra goes down some steps and reaches the hotel reception desk. The same hotel clerk, that we saw earlier in the film, when Sam and Allison came together into the hotel, is talking on the phone. He is talking in a soft voice, so we can't understand exactly what he's saying. \nBut, when Hedra walks in front of his desk, he puts his hand on the receiver microphone, and says, in a louder voice : \nHOTEL CLERK Goodnight, Miss Jones. \nWithout turning her head, Hedra waves her hand. \nHEDRA Goodnight. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY Close up on the clock on the night table : it says 06:22. \nAllison slowly wakes up to some noise in the apartment. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison comes out of her bedroom, wearing a long sleeveless pink night shirt. She seems to be naked underneath. \nShe walks around the room, looking in every room which door is open. \nALLISON Hedy ?... Hedy ? \nShe eventually finds her in the living room, vigorously cleaning the mantlepiece. Hedra is wearing a long plain gray dress and red rubber gloves. Allison remains at the door of the room. \nALLISON Hedy ? Hedra looks up at Allison, but doesn't stop her cleaning. \nHEDRA Oh, hi ! I hope I didn't wake you. I got an early start. \nALLISON No, Hedy, I didn't mean for you to move out today. \nHedra looks around the room. \nHEDRA Oh, there, I think that's it. \nShe goes out of the room into the hall. \nHEDRA I hope you don't mind. I'm storing some of my stuff in the cage downstairs. \nShe resumes her vigorous cleaning in the hall, starting with the small shelf by the front door. \nHEDRA That way, I won't have to bother... You see what I mean... You know... I mean... \nAllison has come near Hedra. \nALLISON Sure, that's fine. Look, I'm really sorry it didn't work out. \nHedra has stacked \u00abher stuff\u00bb near the front door. She picks them up : a red suitcase, a cardboard box and a large paper bag. She has taken her rubber gloves off and keeps them in one hand. \nHEDRA Well, I'd better get this stuff out of here. Allison walks to the door. \nALLISON I'll help. \nShe opens the door. \nALLISON We can have breakfast when you get back. \nHedra walks out of the apartment. Allison closes the door, but remains behind it, lost in her thoughts. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY \nHedra is rapidly walking along a corridor, carrying \u00abher stuff\u00bb. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - INCINERATOR ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nClose up on the open red suitcase. Inside, all the clothes that makes Hedra look like Allison. Hedra takes the clothes out of the suitcase and puts them into the open incinerator. Then she sprays some lighter fluid over the clothes. \nClose up on Hedra's hands striking a match on the side of a matchbox. She throws the match into the incinerator, and long flames immediately start on the clothes. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison is fixing breakfast. She has cut some fruits into small pieces and she puts them in the bowl of the blender. We hear some music from the TV in the background. \nHEDRA Okay ? \nAllison puts the glass down and shakes her head \u00abYes\u00bb. Hedra strokes the back of her head. \nHEDRA Feeling better ? ALLISON Yeah. I can go out for a while. I feel much better now. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison walks out of the bathroom, followed by Hedra. \nHEDRA I thought you said breakfast ? \nAllison has reached the front door, and she starts unlocking the door. \nALLISON Oh, it's in the blender. I've got to go out. \nHedra looks at Allison thin sleeveless night shirt and smiles. \nHEDRA Dressed like that? \nALLISON I'm out. I'm just going to go upstairs and see Graham. He called while you were out. \nHedra looks at Allison with a very strange expression on her face. She can see the tears on Allison's face. \nHEDRA Well, still, if you're not feeling well, you should wear more than that. \nALLISON Maybe you're right. \nShe walks away to her room. Hedra puts her hand on her face. HEDRA Oh... \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison enters her room coming from the hall. \nHEDRA (voice over from the hall) Leave the door open so we can talk. \nAllison grabs a pair of pants and puts them on. \nHedra enters slowly in the room, carrying the large paper bag where she has put the gun. \nAllison takes her night shirt off. She is now naked from the waist up. But she grabs a sweater and puts it on. \nHEDRA You know why I think you're sick ? \nWhile talking, Hedra slowly slides her hand into the paper bag, takes a pair of black gloves out of the bag and puts the bag down on the floor. \nHEDRA You're upset about Sam. \nSlowly, Hedra puts the black gloves on her hands. \nHEDRA You know Sam's dead, don't you ? \nAllison turns around to face Hedra. \nHEDRA Yeah, we don't have much time. \nShe picks up the bag and walks to a chest of drawers. She puts the bag on the floor and opens the top drawer. \nALLISON (crying) You didn't... you didn't do it, Hedy, did you ? \nHedra is taking white pantie and bra from the drawer \nALLISON (crying) You couldn't have him ! \nShe falls down, sitting on the floor and crying. \nALLISON Why ?... Why ? \nHEDRA Allie, he came in my mouth. Then he tried to beat the shit out of me because I wanted to tell you. \nShe slams the drawer shut, and opens another one. HEDRA You know, it was an accident. But he deserved it. \nShe claps her hands. \nHEDRA Okay, come on. The police will be here soon. \nAllison doesn't move and remains seated on the floor. \nALLISON But... but you shouldn't run. That'll only make it worse. I know you weren't yourself when you did this, Hedy. \nHedra laughs. \nHEDRA I know. I was you. \nShe points her gloved finger to Allison, and then looks at herself in the mirror. HEDRA Who is this Hedy anyway ? \nShe turns around, and walks away from the mirror towards Allison. \nHEDRA No one's seen her. She's not on the lease. There's not even a fingerprint of hers here. I've been cleaning like crazy. You have to come with me, Allie, or they'd put you away. \nALLISON Hedy, it'll never work. Besides ... people have seen you. We just can't tell. We'll go to a lawyer or a doctor and they'll explain it to the police, or something. \nHedra, who is now very upset, knocks everything, that was on top of the chest of drawer, with a long sweeping movement, down on the floor. \nSlowly, Allison moves her mouth away from Hedra's one. \nALLISON (whispering) Don't make me leave you, Ellen. \nHedra slowly raises up. She has a strange look on her face. She seems not to understand the situation anymore. \nClose-up on Allison's head and throat. We can see the slightly bloody marks left by the serrated blade. Allison looks at Hedra moving away from her with an anxious face. \nHedra kneels down in front of Allison. She bends down to rest her face on Allison's lap, and starts crying. Allison moves her hand as far as she can and strokes Hedra's hair. \nALLISON Shhh !... It's okay. It's okay. \nClose-up on a wallet on the floor, close to Allison's foot. Allison is trying to reach it with her foot, but she can't because of her leg still being taped on the armchair. \nALLISON (voice over) We've got to get out of here now. \nShe eventually succeeds in kicking the wallet away from the armchair. And she keeps on stroking Hedra's hair, still crying on her lap. \nNEW YORK - EXTERIOR EVENING \nLarge overview of the city. There is still daylight, but we can tell, by the color of the sky, that we are getting closer to the night. \nFONTANA FASHION OFFICE - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR EVENING \nIn the forefront, Mitchell's assistant, Barbara, is typing on the keyboard of a computer. Behind her, we see rows of dresses on hangers. Suddenly, the woman stares at the screen. We hear strange clicking and beeping noises coming from the computer. \nBARBARA Jesus... \nShe stands up, with horror in her face, and yells. \nBARBARA Mitch ! \nFONTANA FASHION OFFICE - MITCHELL'S OFFICE - INTERIOR EVENING \nThe room is much smaller, and quite dark. A blonde woman is sitting on an armchair in front of a desk. Mitchell is standing behind her. Mitchell is slightly rocking the armchair and the blonde woman's eyes are closed. \nMITCHELL What ? He doesn't stop rocking the armchair. \nBARBARA (voice over from the main hall) Get in here. \nMITCHELL What ? \nHe reluctantly leaves the armchair and walks out of the room. \nFONTANA FASHION OFFICE - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR EVENING \nMitchell crosses the hall \nMITCHELL What is it ? What? \nThe computer is still making strange beeping noises. On the screen, pictures of dresses appear and then disappear immediately. \nBARBARA Look. \nClose up on the screen. A data chart titled \u00abFontana Fashions\u00bb has appeared. The extreme left column is labelled \u00abExpenses\u00bb, and underneath, a list of all the expenses (Lease - Telephone - Payroll - Liabilities... and son on). The other columns on the right are labelled \u00abJan\u00bb to \u00abApr\u00bb, and underneath lists of numbers corresponding to the various monthly expenses. \nBut, the data chart has hardly appeared on the screen that the columns of numbers start erasing themselves one by one, starting with January. \nBARBARA It's erasing. \nThen, when all the numbers have been erased, a window appears on the screen with \u00abLOST!\u00bb written in red letters in it. \nAnother data chart appears on the screen : the expenses from May to August. And, on this chart, the columns of numbers also start to erase themselves. \nMitchell looks severely at Barbara. She raises her hands. \nBARBARA I didn't do anything. \nSuddenly, Mitchell seems to remember something. \nMITCHELL Shit ! \nHe runs away toward his office. \nThe blonde woman is standing in the doorway of the office. Mitchell brutally pushes her away. \nFONTANA FASHION OFFICE - MITCHELL'S OFFICE - INTERIOR EVENING Mitchell types something on the keyboard of his computer. We hear the computer beeping. \nClose-up on the computer screen. A data chart titled \u00abProduction line\u00bb, and underneath \u00abFontana Fashions Production Line\u00bb. Underneath, four columns of numbers labelled \u00abOrder\u00bb, \u00abSam\u00bb, \u00abScheduled\u00bb and \u00abCompleted\u00bb. All the numbers in these columns are erasing themselves. And then appears the window with \u00abLOST!\u00bb in red letters. \nMITCHELL (voice over) On mine, too ! \nThen another rectangular window appears on the screen. On the left of the window, the drawing of a bomb with a lighted wick sticking out of it. On the rest of the window, the following text : \nThe last payment in Fulfillment of the Contract between Fontana Fashions and Allison Jones is now past due. Please contact Allison Jones at 212-555-9814 within 24 Hours of the rest of your data will be irretrievably lost. \nMitchell bends down to have a better look at the screen. \nClose up on the screen, while Mitchell reads out loud : \nMITCHELL (voice over) The last payment in Fulfillment of the Contract between Fontana Fashions and Allison Jones is past due. Please contact Allison Jones... \nMedium shot of Mitchell reading what's written on the screen. \nHEDRA Going down. \nThe outer door closes in front of a bewildered Mitchell. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR EVENING \nHedra opens the door of Allison's private \u00abcage\u00bb, and enters the cage. She tries to open a suitcase, but doesn't succeed. She slaps nervously the suitcase. She then finds another suitcase, which is open. She tries to fit herself inside the suitcase, and more or less succeeds. She seems very nervous. She gets out of the suitcase, closes it and carries it out of the cage. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR EVENING Close up on the numbers above the door. They go from \u00ab9\u00bb to \u00ab10\u00bb, and then to \u00ab11\u00bb. \nHedra is watching the numbers. The elevator stops. \nThe outer door opens. Mitchell is there, waiting for the elevator. He opens the inner door and comes in the cabin. The outer door closes automatically and the elevator cabin starts moving up again \nHe looks at the control panel, where the 12th floor is lighted. Then he looks at Hedra, who looks back at him with a rather unwelcoming face. \nThe elevator stops and Mitchell goes out first. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThrough the windows, we can see that night has come. \nMitchell goes out of the elevator, followed by Hedra pulling her suitcase behind her. Hedra goes directly to Graham's apartment. Mitchell first goes in the opposite direction, and then comes back towards Hedra. \nMITCHELL Oh... Excuse me, miss, is this 1203 ? Is Graham Knox at home ? \nHedra is now in front of Graham's door and puts the key in the keyhole. Mitchell has caught up with her, and is standing behind her. \nHEDRA No, he's on a cruise. \nMITCHELL Actually, I'm looking for a woman Allison Jones ? Do you know her ? \nHedra suddenly stops unlocking the door. \nHEDRA Who are you ? \nMITCHELL Mitchell Myerson. \nHedra turns around to face Mitchell. \nMITCHELL She did a job for me. \nHEDRA Oh... There's no one named Jones on this floor. \nMITCHELL Yeah, I know that. I was just down at her apartment. But I did contact her here once. HEDRA Well, I'm the only one here and I never met her. So... You'll excuse me. \nShe bends down to pick up the suitcase. \nMITCHELL Oh, sorry. \nMitchell bends down to help her. He picks up the suitcase and looks at it. \nMITCHELL This is hers. You do know her. \nWe hear a muffled scream coming from inside the apartment. \nHedra opens the door to get inside as fast as possible, but Mitchell catches her and throws her aside. More muffled screams coming from the apartment. Mitchell rushes into the apartment, and closes the door shut behind him. Hedra rushes to the door, but too late. \nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nMitchell rushes into the room, stops and looks down. \nAllison is lying on the carpet, completely tied up in duct tape, looking like a human salami. She is gagged by another piece of tape. When she sees Mitchell, she starts wriggling and screaming through her gag. \nMITCHELL (voice over) What the fuck is going on here ? \nHe kneels down and tears the tape off her mouth. \nALLISON Be careful, she's crazy. \nHedra enters the room, pointing her gun towards Mitchell. \nHEDRA Get off of her. \nMitchell, still kneeling down across Allison's body, turns around. \nMITCHELL What ? \nHedra walks towards him, still pointing her gun with both hands in front of her. \nHEDRA You think she wants you touching her, huh ? I said get off her ! \nMITCHELL Okay, okay... I'm... I'm getting up. Okay. He gets up very slowly with his hands raised at his shoulders level. And suddenly, he grabs the gun and throws Hedra across the room. She falls on a round table, which breaks under her weight. She remains motionless on the floor. \nAllison looks anxiously at the scene, but, from her lying position on the carpet, doesn't see everything. \nMitchell puts the gun inside his belt and kneels down to untie Allison. \nALLISON Where is she ? \nMITCHELL Don't worry about her, I took care of her. \nHedra suddenly comes behind him, and strikes him very hard on the head with a statuette. He falls down on the floor. Hedra rushes to him and picks up the gun from his belt. She takes a cushion from the back of an armchair, puts the cushion on Mitchell's face and presses the barrel of the gun on the cushion. Allison screams. \nAllison succeeds in pulling Hedra out of the apartment. Hedra grabs the front door with both hands to try to resist Allison's pull. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAllison pulls a little harder, and Hedra's hands are squeezed by the door. She screams. Allison lets go of Hedra's legs to close the door shut. \nALLISON Graham, stay inside ! \nGRAHAM (voice over from inside the apartment) All right. Allison runs away towards the elevator. Hedra, still lying on the floor, raises her gun towards Allison and shoots. \nAllison screams : she's been shot in the left shoulder. Hedra shoots again, but Allison hides behind the corner of the wall of the hall. \nHedra gets up to run after Allison. \nClose up on the elevator. Allison is already inside the cabin and closes the inner door just as Hedra reaches the elevator. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR DAY \nHEDRA No... No... No... \nAllison pulls Hedra right arm through the vertical bars of the inner door, and opens it again, squeezing Hedra's arm very hard. Hedra screams and drops her gun on the cabin floor. Allison closes the inner door shut. \nClose up of Allison's hand picking the gun up from the floor. \nHEDRA No... No... No... \nHedra watches the outer door closing slowly. \nAllison points the gun towards Hedra and presses the trigger several times. But nothing happens : there are no more cartridge in the chamber of the gun. \nHedra opens the inner door to get into the elevator. Allison tries to prevent her from getting in, but Hedra eventually succeeds in getting into the cabin. She closes the inner door, and the outer door closes itself automatically. Hedra throws Allison against the wall of the cabin. Then she bangs her head very hard against the wall. Allison pulls Hedra away from her. Hedra hits the wall on the other side of the cabin, and falls on the floor. Allison rushes and falls on Hedra, but Hedra pushes her away from her. \nThe two girls start fighting in the cabin. They fall on the floor, Hedra on top of Allison. Hedra tries to strangle Allison. \nClose up of Allison's face choking under the pressure of Hedra's hands. \nShort reverse angle close up shot of Hedra's face, then back to Allison's face. \nClose up on the screwdriver hanging from its chain and rocking gently with the movement of the elevator. Allison's hand tries to catch it and doesn't succeed. \nBack on Allison's face, suffocating more and more under Hedra's strangulation. Back, for a couple of seconds, to Allison's hand trying to catch the screwdriver, and then back to her suffocating face. \nClose up on Allison's hand which has eventually caught the screwdriver, then back to her face. The face slowly relaxes as Allison falls into unconsciousness. Her arm, which was extended to catch the screwdriver, falls on the floor of the cabin. \nHedra watches Allison's face intently. Then, when she realizes that Allison is unconscious, she bends down and kisses her on the cheek. She brings Allison's both arms along Allison's sides, then she puts her head on her chest and kisses her hand. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY \nThe outer door of the elevator opens, and, through the vertical bars of the inner door, we can see Allison still lying on her back on the floor of the cabin. Hedra opens the inner door, then pulls Allison by the legs out of the elevator. \nHEDRA (snorting under the effort of pulling Allison) Huh... Huh... \nShe pulls Allison along the corridor of the basement. \nShe reaches the door opening on the emergency staircase, and kicks it shut. \nShe suddenly stops and looks intently at Allison lying on the floor. She grabs a green blanket on a shelf and wraps Allison's face in it. \nShe pushes a a heavy metallic storage shelves cabinet along the wall all the way to the emergency staircase door, in order to prevent it from being opened by anyone coming from the staircase. \nThen she pulls down a big lever on the wall on the side of the cage where the elevator machinery is enclosed. We supposed it is the emergency switch of the elevator, and that she also wants to prevent anyone coming down to the basement from using the elevator. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - INCINERATOR ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nHedra picks up some pieces of dry wood from a wheelbarrow and puts them inside the incinerator, where some flames are still burning. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY \nHedra pushes the empty wheelbarrow along the corridor of the basement. \nSuddenly she stops, drops the wheelbarrow and emits a short scream. \nReverse angle shot on the green blanket on the floor. Allison is gone. \nHedra looks very worried. \nHEDRA Allie ? \nShe runs to the blanket, but doesn't stop and keeps on running to the elevator. She gives a quick look inside the open cabin, then tries to open a large locked gate, near the elevator, but doesn't succeed. \nHEDRA (yelling) Allie ? \nShe goes back along the corridor the way she came from. Near the place where she left the wheelbarrow, she comes to a door marked \u00abStorage\u00bb, and opens it \nHEDRA Hey, here you are. \nBut this is just a closet full of various junk. \nHedra thinks she heard something and quickly turns around. She takes a big iron hook from the storage closet and starts walking menacingly along the corridor. \nHEDRA Don't make me come get you... Allie, come out now... Come on... Allie !... \nShe bangs the hook on a vertical pipe on the wall. \n", "test1_input": "Close-up on the ancient-looking ventilation system in the bedroom. The air vent is protected by a very decorative wrought iron grill, as can be found in old New-York buildings. \nSAM (voice over) I didn't go over there intending to sleep with her, Allie. I swear to God. \nALLISON (voice over) Oh, well, I fell a lot better knowing you can talk now. \nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - GRAHAM'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose-up on the same air vent in Graham's apartment. We can hear the conversation going on in Allison's bedroom, with a slight echo effect in the sound, which makes some words incomprehensible, but still well enough to get the general idea of the conversation. SAM (voice over from the air vent) She's very depressed, OK ? It's the anniversary of our divorce. She heard we were getting married. She has been drinking. \nSlowly the camera moves from the air vent to Graham's bed. \nGraham Knox is about thirty years old, and we shall learn later that he is gay. He is lying in his bed, perhaps naked, but we see only his chest, the rest of his body being covered by the sheets. He was apparently awaken by the voices in the ventilation system and is half-raised on his elbow and listening to the conversation. \nALLISON (voice over from the air vent) I don't want to hear this ! \nSAM (voice over from the air vent) I feel bad for her. I'm moving on feeling guilty. It won't happen again. \nALLISON (voice over from the air vent) (a few words incomprehensible) I am supposed to trust you now ? \nGraham is listening with a worried look on his face. \nFade out to two second of black screen, during which we keep on hearing the conversation through the ventilation system, but without understanding the words. And then : \nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAllison rings the bell of Graham's apartment. It says 1203 on the door. \nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT A corridor with a lot of books on shelves going all the way up to the ceiling. Graham walks along the corridor, zipping his pants. He is bare-chested. \nGRAHAM It's 4 a.m. ! \nALLISON (voice over through the door) It's me, Graham. \nGraham opens the door. Allison is just wearing a night-robe, and her face is full of tears. \nGRAHAM Allie ? \nALLISON I'm sorry... Sam left. I told him to. And... And I can't be alone tonight... so I came up here. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT \nGraham takes Allison by the hand and brings her inside his apartment. \nALLISON Thanks. \nGraham closes the door behind Allison. \nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nA nice room with pictures on the wall. Allison is sleeping in a large bed. Through the shutter-less window, we can see the other buildings. \nGraham, dressed in a black T-shirt and kaki short pants, enters the room and sits on the bed. He takes Allison's leg through the bedcover. Allison stands up with a start. \nGRAHAM Allie, I let you sleep. \nALLISON What time is it ? \nGRAHAM About ten. \nALLISON Oh, my God \nAllison jumps from the bed in a hurry. \nALLISON I've got a meeting. It's really important. \nGraham, still seated on the bed, watches her leave the room. NEW YORK - A BUSY STREET - EXTERIOR DAY \nAllison walks quite rapidly on the sidewalk. She comes to a shop and looks through the window. She combs her hair with her hand. \nA RESTAURANT - INTERIOR DAY \nA nice restaurant in New-York. Paintings on the walls. Soft music. A waitress is talking on the phone. Allison enters the restaurant and crosses the room to a table, where a man, who was sitting alone, stands up when she comes to him. The man is Mitchell Myerson, Allison's appointment. \nALLISON Hi ! \nMITCHELL Hi ! \nALLISON I'm sorry, I'm a little late. They shake hands. \nMITCHELL No, no, it's worth the wait. \nALLISON Thank you. \nThey sit down. The man takes his glass. \nALLISON So... \nA little later. They have finished their meal. Allison has put her laptop computer on the table and is typing on the keyboard. On the screen of the computer, we see models of woman's dresses changing color and appearance each time Allison presses a key. \nALLISON You can redefine your product on-screen without going to an expensive designing concept. This is Allison Jones' software, and it's a marketing tool no one else has. \nMITCHELL Who do I get to run it ? \n", "test1_true": "MITCHELL Ah !... The quote... That's the one thing I haven't seen. \nALLISON Best for last. \nShe gives him a printed paper. ALLISON I think you'll find that's reasonable... as a ballpark. \nMITCHELL Here's where I was thinking of playing. \nHe takes a pen out of his pocket and start writing on the document Allison gave him. Then he hands back the document to her. She reads it and seems surprised. \nMITCHELL It makes sense for you. You see, after our last meeting, I made some phone calls... to your former partner, for one. \nALLISON No, I wouldn't rely much on what she says. It was not a friendly split. And I did all the work. And... she took all the credit and she didn't like me telling her so. \nMITCHELL Well, I was more interested in the settlement you made. You walked off with the hardware and a rent-controlled apartment. Which means your overhead is minimal, as is your client list. I could improve that if you're as good as you say you are. \nHe points to what he wrote on the document Allison is still holding. \nMITCHELL But that is the only way to prove it. \nALLISON Well, I could go for something... \nThe waiter puts the bill in a small tray on the table. \nMITCHELL No, no, please, don't embarrass yourself. That's my final offer. Now, of course, if you would like to think about it... \nAllison takes the bill from the tray, and tears the tab off the bill. \nALLISON I'll get this. You'll see it on my first expense report. \nMITCHELL I look forward to it. \nThey shake hands. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nThe front door opens and Allison gets in and closes the door. She drops her keys and her handbag on a shelf near the door. She goes to the answering machine, and presses a key. THE ANSWERING MACHINE No messages. \nThe machine beeps. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison starts tearing the sheets off the bed. Her movements are very nervous. And, eventually, she drops on the sheet-less mattress and starts crying. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - LAUNDRY ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nWe hear the first words of Graham's sentence on the previous image of Allison crying on her bed. \nAllison and Graham are working on their respective laundry on a table. We see washing machines working in the background. \nGRAHAM What is this ? A song cue ? \u00abYou're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You.\u00bb ALLISON It's just living alone, you know. I thought about buying those books like \u00abCooking for One\u00bb. It's just too depressing. \nGRAHAM There are worse things than being on your own, you know. \nALLISON Maybe it's all a sign I should go home. \nGRAHAM Come on ! You came here for a reason. Sam has nothing to do with that. No guy does. You think I'd let some guy interfere with my acting career ? Assuming I had a career... or a guy to interfere with it. \nALLISON You'll find someone again. \nGRAHAM Maybe I will. Why not ? But the point is, if I don't... I don't. \nALLISON I know that. I can do it on my own. \nGRAHAM Absolutely. \nALLISON I'll just get a room-mate. \nGRAHAM You could always call him, Allie. \nALLISON Not if I have a room-mate. \nCOMPUTER SCREEN \nAn Apple Computer Screen (certainly Mac OS 7 or even Mac OS 6, since the film was made in 1991/1992). The window is titled \u00abComlink Fax TM\u00bb. On the window itself we can read : \nATZ OK ENTER YOUR AD NOW SWF SEEKS FEMALE TO SHARE APARTMENT IN W70S NON-SMOKER PROFESSIONAL PREFERRED \nWhen we first see the computer screen, only \u00abSWF SEEKS FEMALE TO SH\u00bb is written. We hear the clicks of the computer keys as the rest of the ad is written. The computer screen fades into a newspaper clip after \u00abPROFESSIONAL PREF\u00bb is written. \nNEWSPAPER CLIP \nWe see a newspaper clip, where Allison's ad has been highlighted with a felt-pen red rectangle. It says : \nSWF seeks female to share apartment in west 70s. Non-smoker professional preferred. 555-9814 \nAround this ad are other ads, all about apartment renting or sharing. \nALLISON (voice over) The managers couldn't really know you want to live there. \nALLISON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY \nThe previous voice over sentence ends on a close-up of the folded newspaper with a red felt-pen lying on the newspaper. \n", "test1_id": 2991, "test2_input": "MITCHELL Ho-ho. According to this, we should have paid you last Friday. \nALLISON That's all right. Barbara will handle that. \nMITCHELL Not till I give her the word. \nAllison turns to him, and seems not to like his strange smile. \nALLISON Well, I hope you're satisfied with what I've done. \nMITCHELL So far. \nHe walks away from her and goes to the Champagne table. \nALLISON But this is it. I mean, there ain't much more. Just maybe a little fine tuning, that's it. I have some free time now, if you want us to set up some meeting with your colleagues. \nUsing a napkin, he is drying a bottle of Champagne he just got out of its bucket. \nMITCHELL I was thinking that maybe I want to keep you all to myself. \nHe throws the napkin on the floor, and comes back toward Allison with the bottle of Champagne. He puts the bottom of the bottle on Allison's bare shoulders. She shivers. \nMITCHELL Top her ? \nALLISON What are you doing ? \nHe puts his other hand on her shoulder. Then he puts the bottle on the table, and starts massaging her shoulders. \nMITCHELL That's just that you're so tight. ALLISON Mitch, please, don't. That's enough. \nHe grabs her from behind and squeezes her in his arms. \nALLISON Mitch... \nMITCHELL Hey, look... \nHe kisses her neck. \nMITCHELL I've been a good boy, haven't I ? And you've been a good girl. We have nothing to prove any more. \nHe keeps on kissing her neck, and puts his hand inside her dress to reach her breast. Allison seems to be on the verge of tears. \nMITCHELL This is your last chance to play before you're an old married lady. \nALLISON Let me turn around, okay ? \nShe has a strange smile on her lips. \nMITCHELL That's better. That's better. \nHe stands up. \nMITCHELL Just a second... A second... \nWhile she slowly turns around on her swivel seat, he starts unzipping his pants, and lets them fall on his ankles, showing his white trunks. \nAllison, still   seated, is now facing him, her face at the level of his crotch. He   takes her head to guide it toward his private parts. Allison   looks up at him and then, with both fists and all her might, she   hits him very hard between his legs. He screams. \nShe jumps from her seat and runs out of the room. \nHe falls on the floor, holding his private parts with both hands. \nMITCHELL Fucking bitch ! \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose-up on Allison, still in her black dress, and holding a glass of wine. \nHEDRA (voice over) Here. Take this. \nWe see Hedra's hand giving some pills to Allison. She then replaces the glass of wine by a glass of water. \nALLISON I can't believe I didn't see it coming. It's just so humiliating. \nHEDRA (voice over) You're too nice, that's the problem. Men are pigs. I don't care how nice they seem. You always fall for that. \nALLISON But what I did... It was like something inside taking over. It was scary. \nWe see Hedra standing near the mantlepiece. She is wearing an orange T-shirt and a red skirt. \nHEDRA No, Allie, don't turn this around. You're the victim. He should pay for this. \nShe kneels on the floor in front of Allison. \nALLISON He'll pay. I set up all my programs, so they have to eventually. \nHedra laughs. \nHEDRA What ! I'm not talking about getting paid, I'm talking about getting even. \nALLISON You don't understand. It's the contacts more than the money. When I just took the job for the word of mouth and now that's gone. It's just like he's put me back to square one. \nHEDRA Only if you let him. But you won't let him, will you ? \n", "test2_true": "HEDRA Oh, Allie... \nShe opens Allison's purse and takes her address-book. \nHEDRA Of course, Sam's away. I didn't want to say anything... How he could go on that trip the day after Buddy died. \nShe walks to the telephone table in the hall, flipping the pages of the address-book. HEDRA Especially when it was his fault. \nSince the bedroom door is wide open, we can see Hedra in the hall. She picks up the phone and starts dialing. \nHEDRA Hello ! May I speak with your husband, please ? \nALLISON Who are you calling ? \nShe gets up from the sofa on which she was sitting. \nHEDRA Yes, I know it's late. Tell him it's Allison Jones, he'll take the call. \nAllison has come to the telephone table. \nALLISON Who are you talking ? Hedra shushes Allison with her finger. \nHEDRA Listen, you pathetic shit. Do you want to hold on to your business ?... No, you listen to me this time, asshole ! If you trash me around town, you're fucked and your family is fucked, too ! You got that ? It won't just be you. \nShe puts the phone down, and starts laughing. \nHEDRA Let me tell you, he is pissing in his p.j.'s right now. \nALLISON Gee, Hedy, I hope you never get mad at me. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY \nHigh-angle shot of the building, taken from the roof of the building across the street. We see Allison and Hedra coming out of the building. From this height, they look like a couple of ants ! \nALLISON (voice over) Hedy, we really have to talk. \nHEDRA (voice over) Allie, please, I have a surprise for you. \nALLISON (voice over) Hedy ! \nA STREET OUTSIDE JOHN DELLAR'S HAIR SALON - EXTERIOR DAY \nAllison and Hedra are walking on the sidewalk. They stop in front of the shop of \u00abJohn Dellar's Hair Salon\u00bb. \nALLISON Oh, Hedy, I'm not really up for this today. \nHEDRA What ? \nShe puts her hand on Allison's neck. \nHEDRA No, no, no, this is going to be fun. It'll make you feel better, promise. Okay ? And I'm paying. Go. \nShe takes Allison by the hand and drags her to the door of the shop. \nHEDRA Let's go. \nAllison tries to resist Hedra. \nALLISON Oh, Hedy. HEDRA It'll be fine, come on. \nThey enter the shop. \nJOHN DELLAR HAIR SALON - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison is seated in front of a large mirror. An attendant is taking the protection garment off her shoulders. \nALLISON Thank you. \nShe smiles. She seems happy and puts her hands through her hair. Suddenly she stops, and the smile disappears from her mouth. She looks up in the mirror at someone descending the stairs from the upper level of the shop. She makes the swivel chair turn around to have a better look at the staircase. \nClose-up on Hedra going down the stair. Her hairdo is so much like Allison's one that she almost looks like a twin sister of Allison. \nBack to Allison's thunderstruck face. \nALLISON You've got to be kidding. \nA STREET - EXTERIOR DAY \nAllison and Hedra are walking in a busy street. If Hedra was not a bit shorter than Allison, one could think they were twins. Allison seems angry. \nALLISON You just should've asked first. \nHEDRA Well, I wanted it to be a surprise. They stop at a newspaper stand. \nALLISON Can I have the Consumer Market, please. \nNEWSPAPER STAND ATTENDANT Sure. \nThe attendant picks up a magazine from a rack and Allison picks up some other magazines at random. \nHEDRA This feels so good on my neck. I didn't think you'd mind. \nAllison is paying the attendant. \n", "test2_id": 2992, "test3_input": "Reverse angle shot. Allison looks at the remote control on the armrest. \nClose up on the remote control. Almost at the top of the remote control, we see the two volume control buttons : up and down. And under those buttons, we see the two channel control buttons. \nClose up on Allison's face looking at the remote control. \nClose up on Allison's right hand moving the remote control on the armrest, to get the volume control buttons within reach of her forefinger. She presses the up button. On the TV screen, we see the volume bar graph going up on the picture of a crocodile. And the volume of the music goes up too. \nAllison looks at the remote control again. \nClose up on Allison's forefinger pressing one of the channel control buttons. \nOn the screen, we see a different channel : a comic movie. A couple is having dinner in a restaurant and the waiter pours the water bucket on the man. \nAnother channel. A woman is sleeping. A telephone rings. \nReverse angle shot on Allison pressing the channel control buttons. We hear a male voice for a couple of second, then Allison changes the channel again. \nThe TV screen seen from behind Allison's hand dialing on the remote control. There is a cartoon on the screen. Then another channel showing the concert of a rock music band. \nClose up on Allison's face looking at the screen and then at the remote control in her hand. \nReverse angle shot on the TV set. The volume bar graph is going up again until it reaches the end of the graph. The volume of the sound of the rock music is very high. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR DAY \nWe hear the rock music very loudly in the empty hall. \nThe front door of apartment 1206 opens slowly. A man with glasses on his nose peeks into the hall. He seems very annoyed by the noise. BANK OFFICE - HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nClose up on the hand of Hedra writing \u00abEllen Besch\u00bb on the back of a cheque on the cashier's counter. In front of her, we see the hands of the cashier girl on the other side of the glass partition. \nCASHIER GIRL (voice over) What's the part this time ? \nLarger view of the bank office hall. Hedra is standing in front of the cashier's desk. We see the cashier girl through the partition glass. Behind Hedra, a man is waiting for his turn, reading a newspaper. \nHEDRA Excuse me ? \nThrough the opening at the bottom of the partition, she gives her cheque to the girl. Closer shot. Now we are on the cashier's side of the partition, and we see Hedra's face through the glass. \nCASHIER GIRL You're an actress, right ? You're never the same person twice. \nReverse angle shot. We are now on Hedra's side of the partition, and we see the cashier girl through the glass : she is a blonde girl about the same age as Hedra.

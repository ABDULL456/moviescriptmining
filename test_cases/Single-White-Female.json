{"test1_input": "Close-up on the ancient-looking ventilation system in the bedroom. The air vent is protected by a very decorative wrought iron grill, as can be found in old New-York buildings. \nSAM (voice over) I didn't go over there intending to sleep with her, Allie. I swear to God. \nALLISON (voice over) Oh, well, I fell a lot better knowing you can talk now. \nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - GRAHAM'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose-up on the same air vent in Graham's apartment. We can hear the conversation going on in Allison's bedroom, with a slight echo effect in the sound, which makes some words incomprehensible, but still well enough to get the general idea of the conversation. SAM (voice over from the air vent) She's very depressed, OK ? It's the anniversary of our divorce. She heard we were getting married. She has been drinking. \nSlowly the camera moves from the air vent to Graham's bed. \nGraham Knox is about thirty years old, and we shall learn later that he is gay. He is lying in his bed, perhaps naked, but we see only his chest, the rest of his body being covered by the sheets. He was apparently awaken by the voices in the ventilation system and is half-raised on his elbow and listening to the conversation. \nALLISON (voice over from the air vent) I don't want to hear this ! \nSAM (voice over from the air vent) I feel bad for her. I'm moving on feeling guilty. It won't happen again. \nALLISON (voice over from the air vent) (a few words incomprehensible) I am supposed to trust you now ? \nGraham is listening with a worried look on his face. \nFade out to two second of black screen, during which we keep on hearing the conversation through the ventilation system, but without understanding the words. And then : \nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAllison rings the bell of Graham's apartment. It says 1203 on the door. \nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT A corridor with a lot of books on shelves going all the way up to the ceiling. Graham walks along the corridor, zipping his pants. He is bare-chested. \nGRAHAM It's 4 a.m. ! \nALLISON (voice over through the door) It's me, Graham. \nGraham opens the door. Allison is just wearing a night-robe, and her face is full of tears. \nGRAHAM Allie ? \nALLISON I'm sorry... Sam left. I told him to. And... And I can't be alone tonight... so I came up here. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT \nGraham takes Allison by the hand and brings her inside his apartment. \nALLISON Thanks. \nGraham closes the door behind Allison. \nGRAHAM'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nA nice room with pictures on the wall. Allison is sleeping in a large bed. Through the shutter-less window, we can see the other buildings. \nGraham, dressed in a black T-shirt and kaki short pants, enters the room and sits on the bed. He takes Allison's leg through the bedcover. Allison stands up with a start. \nGRAHAM Allie, I let you sleep. \nALLISON What time is it ? \nGRAHAM About ten. \nALLISON Oh, my God \nAllison jumps from the bed in a hurry. \nALLISON I've got a meeting. It's really important. \nGraham, still seated on the bed, watches her leave the room. NEW YORK - A BUSY STREET - EXTERIOR DAY \nAllison walks quite rapidly on the sidewalk. She comes to a shop and looks through the window. She combs her hair with her hand. \nA RESTAURANT - INTERIOR DAY \nA nice restaurant in New-York. Paintings on the walls. Soft music. A waitress is talking on the phone. Allison enters the restaurant and crosses the room to a table, where a man, who was sitting alone, stands up when she comes to him. The man is Mitchell Myerson, Allison's appointment. \nALLISON Hi ! \nMITCHELL Hi ! \nALLISON I'm sorry, I'm a little late. They shake hands. \nMITCHELL No, no, it's worth the wait. \nALLISON Thank you. \nThey sit down. The man takes his glass. \nALLISON So... \nA little later. They have finished their meal. Allison has put her laptop computer on the table and is typing on the keyboard. On the screen of the computer, we see models of woman's dresses changing color and appearance each time Allison presses a key. \nALLISON You can redefine your product on-screen without going to an expensive designing concept. This is Allison Jones' software, and it's a marketing tool no one else has. \nMITCHELL Who do I get to run it ? \n", "test1_true": "MITCHELL Ah !... The quote... That's the one thing I haven't seen. \nALLISON Best for last. \nShe gives him a printed paper. ALLISON I think you'll find that's reasonable... as a ballpark. \nMITCHELL Here's where I was thinking of playing. \nHe takes a pen out of his pocket and start writing on the document Allison gave him. Then he hands back the document to her. She reads it and seems surprised. \nMITCHELL It makes sense for you. You see, after our last meeting, I made some phone calls... to your former partner, for one. \nALLISON No, I wouldn't rely much on what she says. It was not a friendly split. And I did all the work. And... she took all the credit and she didn't like me telling her so. \nMITCHELL Well, I was more interested in the settlement you made. You walked off with the hardware and a rent-controlled apartment. Which means your overhead is minimal, as is your client list. I could improve that if you're as good as you say you are. \nHe points to what he wrote on the document Allison is still holding. \nMITCHELL But that is the only way to prove it. \nALLISON Well, I could go for something... \nThe waiter puts the bill in a small tray on the table. \nMITCHELL No, no, please, don't embarrass yourself. That's my final offer. Now, of course, if you would like to think about it... \nAllison takes the bill from the tray, and tears the tab off the bill. \nALLISON I'll get this. You'll see it on my first expense report. \nMITCHELL I look forward to it. \nThey shake hands. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nThe front door opens and Allison gets in and closes the door. She drops her keys and her handbag on a shelf near the door. She goes to the answering machine, and presses a key. THE ANSWERING MACHINE No messages. \nThe machine beeps. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison starts tearing the sheets off the bed. Her movements are very nervous. And, eventually, she drops on the sheet-less mattress and starts crying. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - LAUNDRY ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nWe hear the first words of Graham's sentence on the previous image of Allison crying on her bed. \nAllison and Graham are working on their respective laundry on a table. We see washing machines working in the background. \nGRAHAM What is this ? A song cue ? \u00abYou're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You.\u00bb ALLISON It's just living alone, you know. I thought about buying those books like \u00abCooking for One\u00bb. It's just too depressing. \nGRAHAM There are worse things than being on your own, you know. \nALLISON Maybe it's all a sign I should go home. \nGRAHAM Come on ! You came here for a reason. Sam has nothing to do with that. No guy does. You think I'd let some guy interfere with my acting career ? Assuming I had a career... or a guy to interfere with it. \nALLISON You'll find someone again. \nGRAHAM Maybe I will. Why not ? But the point is, if I don't... I don't. \nALLISON I know that. I can do it on my own. \nGRAHAM Absolutely. \nALLISON I'll just get a room-mate. \nGRAHAM You could always call him, Allie. \nALLISON Not if I have a room-mate. \nCOMPUTER SCREEN \nAn Apple Computer Screen (certainly Mac OS 7 or even Mac OS 6, since the film was made in 1991/1992). The window is titled \u00abComlink Fax TM\u00bb. On the window itself we can read : \nATZ OK ENTER YOUR AD NOW SWF SEEKS FEMALE TO SHARE APARTMENT IN W70S NON-SMOKER PROFESSIONAL PREFERRED \nWhen we first see the computer screen, only \u00abSWF SEEKS FEMALE TO SH\u00bb is written. We hear the clicks of the computer keys as the rest of the ad is written. The computer screen fades into a newspaper clip after \u00abPROFESSIONAL PREF\u00bb is written. \nNEWSPAPER CLIP \nWe see a newspaper clip, where Allison's ad has been highlighted with a felt-pen red rectangle. It says : \nSWF seeks female to share apartment in west 70s. Non-smoker professional preferred. 555-9814 \nAround this ad are other ads, all about apartment renting or sharing. \nALLISON (voice over) The managers couldn't really know you want to live there. \nALLISON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY \nThe previous voice over sentence ends on a close-up of the folded newspaper with a red felt-pen lying on the newspaper. \n", "test1_id": 2991, "test2_input": "ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose-up of Allison's face, looking slightly frightened. She puts the puppy on the floor. \nReverse angle shot on the mirror in Hedra's bedroom. We see Hedra sitting up on her bed. \nAllison runs through the hall towards her bedroom. The puppy follows her, but she shuts the door before it can gets in the room. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAllison jumps into her bed and lies down. We can hear the puppy yapping behind the door. Allison hears the door opening. She puts her head on the pillow, closes her eyes and pretends she is asleep. \nHedra walks slowly across the room towards the bed. She is wearing her night gown. \nWe see Allison's shoulder moving slowly up and down, just as she was really asleep. \nHedra remains a few seconds looking at Allison, then starts walking back towards the door. \nClose-up shot on Allison's face. Her eyes are closed, but, when she hears the door closing, she opens them again. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nSam is fixing a broken piece of wrought iron on the balustrade on the balcony. He is screwing a sleeve clamp to fix the broken piece on the main body of the balustrade. \nHEDRA (voice over) They're ready. \nSAM Right, just a minute. \nHedra is coming out of the kitchen with a frying pan. She is just wearing her night gown. She is stirring some scrambled eggs in the pan. \nHEDRA They'll get cold. \nShe eats a piece of crispy bacon out of the pan. \nSAM All right, all right. \nSam climbs out of the balcony. \nA wider shot shows Hedra back in the kitchen, cooking something on the stove. Sam slides the window down, and then walks across the room and into the kitchen. The puppy gets out of its basket and follows him. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison gets out of her bedroom, fully dressed and ready to go to work. She hears voices coming out of the kitchen. \nSAM (voice over) No, no, Rawson is a Norse name. \nAllison opens the kitchen door. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY \nSam and Hedra are eating breakfast seated on either side of the small kitchen table. The puppy is eating something off the floor. \nSAM (finishing the sentence he was saying in voice over while Allison was opening the door) Well, isn't this a thoroughly uninteresting conversation. \nHe looks up at Allison entering the room \nSAM Hey ! \nHEDRA Hi ! \nALLISON We going ? \nShe walks to the sink, and picks up an orange. Sam gives her a kiss on the cheek. She turns her head and doesn't respond to the kiss. \nHedra comes toward them with a plate in her hand. She gives the plate to Allison. \nHEDRA Scrambled or fried ? \nAllison doesn't take the plate and shows her the orange. She seems quite upset. \nALLISON (whispering) This is fine. \nShe gets out of the kitchen. Sam turns his head towards Hedra and then follows Allison. \nHedra walks a couple of steps towards the open door and listen to the conversation going on in the living room SAM (voice over) Allie, sweetheart, this isn't all that urgent. You know, if you don't want to do this apartment thing today, it can wait till I get back. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nHedra is standing in the doorway leading to the kitchen, with the plate still in her hand. \nReverse angle shot on the legs of Allison and Sam. The puppy is playing between them, putting its nose on Allison's leg. \nSAM Why don't we get away together ? Drive to Box Camp ? \nReverse angle shot on Hedra bending down and slapping her thigh. \nHEDRA Buddy, come here, boy. She takes a piece of bacon out of the plate and shows it to the puppy. \nReverse angle shot on Allison and Sam. \nThe puppy doesn't respond at all to Hedra's call and food. \nHEDRA (voice over) Come on, three's a crowd, sweetie. \n", "test2_true": "Reverse angle shot on Hedra standing up and finishing her plate. \nThen reverse angle shot again on Allison and Sam. \nSAM Well, wouldn't you like to take a day off... Renting a car... \nALLISON No, I'm okay. I'm fine. I just didn't get a very good sleep, that's all. Nightmares. Okay ? \nSam gives her a very tender kiss, which she gives him back. \nReverse angle shot on Hedra looking very angry. She goes back into the kitchen and puts her plate down. She then walks into the living room, looking very casual. \nHEDRA You've got a good day for it if it doesn't get too hot. \nShe gives a light tap on Sam's back when she walks behind him. She takes a food plate off Allison's desk, and starts walking away towards the kitchen with the plate. \nALLISON You don't have to do that, Hedy. You're doing enough already. \nHEDRA Oh, I don't mind. It's clean when you can't tell I'm here. \nShe enters the kitchen to put the plate down. She then comes back into the living room. \nHEDRA Oh... Hey, if the eggs were okay, maybe you guys can trust me with dinner. Do you know when you'll be back ? \nALLISON Oh, no, it's kind of an anniversary tonight. So I think we'll be eating out. \nHEDRA Really ? Well, that's great... Well, good luck. We can see, by her expression, that Hedra is not very happy about what she just heard, but she keeps a smiling face. \nSam and Allison walks out of the room. \nHedra wrinkles the front of her night gown with her nervous hands. She walks slowly toward the hall. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nSam and Allison are going out of the apartment. \nHEDRA Goodbye. \nSam closes the door behind them. The puppy remains behind the door, whining. \nHedra sits down on the floor, leaning on the wall near the door of the living room. \nHEDRA Buddy, come here. \nShe taps her hand on the floor. \nHEDRA Come here, sweetie. \nThe puppy doesn't move away from the front door, and keeps on yapping and crying. \nHEDRA I know... I know. \nShe seems very nervous. The dog keeps on yapping at the door. HEDRA Buddy, come ! \nShe taps her hand on the floor in a more and more nervous way. \nHEDRA (angry voice) Come ! \nThe dog doesn't move from the door, and keeps on yapping. \nHEDRA (calmer voice) Fine. \nAN EMPTY APARTMENT - INTERIOR DAY \nA large room in a typical old New-York apartment. Large windows going almost to the ceiling. Through the windows we see roofs with water tanks on them. The room is empty, save for a ladder and a few tools. \nThe real estate agent is standing with some papers in his hand. Sam and Allison are coming towards him from the other side of the room. \nSAM But this is half the size for twice the price from your apartment. \nALLISON It's easier this way, believe me. And this could be nice. \nThey walk away toward the exit of the apartment. The agent remains standing on the same spot. \nSAM Can you imagine going from The Victoria to this. \nNEW YORK - A STREET NEAR ALLISON'S PLACE - EXTERIOR DAY \nA busy street in New York, with small shops with goods for sale on counters on the sidewalk. \nSam and Allison are walking down the street. \nSAM Do you think we can smoke her out ? \nALLISON This is such a mess. I just can't do it right now. I think I'm her only friend. \nThey turn the corner of the street, and we hear a scream. Sam and Allison both lift their heads. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY \nLow angle shot taken from ground level showing a woman running on her balcony. She bends over the balustrade to look down. \nTHE WOMAN ON THE BALCONY My God, what happened ? \n", "test2_id": 2992, "test3_input": "ALLISON Thank you... please. \nHedra seems to be worried by Allison's very cold reaction to her \u00absurprise\u00bb. She seems even a bit sad. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison is looking at the dresses hanging in the closet. \nHEDRA (voice over) I'm going to take a shower. \nAllison walks out of her room into the hall. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nThrough the open door of the bathroom, we see Hedra turing the water faucet on in the shower cubicle, then taking her belt off. She closes the door of the bathroom. \nAllison stealthily runs into Hedra's bedroom. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison enters the room, and looks around. She walks to the closet and starts looking through Hedra's clothes. Suddenly, she notices the shoebox on the shelf above the clothes. \nClose up on the shoebox and then on Allison's hand picking it up. \nAllison opens the shoebox. She sits down on the bed, and starts looking through the content of the box. She takes several papers out of the box and looks more closely at them. \nClose-up on the documents Allison is looking through. Several photographs, and then a black and white photograph of two twin girls with a puppy between them. The twin girls are the one we saw at the very beginning of the film. \nAllison looks very attentively at the picture. She puts the documents she is holding into the lid of the box and starts looking at the rest of the documents. Close-up on an envelope that reads : \nELLEN BESCH 441 OCEANSIDE EAST TAMPA, FLA \nAllison seems surprised by the name on the envelope. \nALLISON Ellen Besch... \nShe looks through all the other envelopes. On another envelope, a computer-generated label has been glued on the original Ellen Besch address. It reads : \nAUTOMATED MAIL PO BOX NEW YORK PO BOX 72810 c/o 845 W. 93RD ST NEW YORK NY 10024 \nShe puts the envelopes back into the box, and picks up other documents. They are newspapers clippings. \nClose-up on the clipping Allison is holding. There is a picture of two young twin girls, and above, a title that reads : \nNINE-YEAR-OLD BESCH TWIN DROWNS AT FAMILY PICNIC \nAnd underneath : \nServices were held Friday at Hope Lutheran Church for nine-year old, Judy Besch, of Mapic Drive, who drowned Tuesday at a family picnic. Circumstances surrounding her death remain unclear. A eulogy was delivered by Dr. William Starr, the family's doctor for many years. Among the \nShe puts the clippings back into the box and picks up another envelope. \nClose-up on the envelope, which reads : \nALLIE JONES 768 W. 74TH ST. #1103 NEW YORK, NY 10017 \nALLISON (voice over) Sam ! \nWe see Allison's hand looking inside the already opened envelope and taking a key-ring out. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY Close-up on Hedra's hand turning the water faucet off. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison is reading the letter which was with the keys. \nClose-up shot on the letter. It was written on a Hotel Atherton stationery. The close-up is too close for us to be able to read all the words, but we still can read : \nDEAR ALLIE, \nI KNOW HOW MUCH I HU AND I KNOW HOW LITTLE MY CAN DO TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT. BUT PLEASE FOR THE SAKE WHAT WE HAD, GIVE ME THE CHANCE TO SAY THEM. YOU FORGIVE ME, MAYBE I TOO. I NEVER WILL, IF WHAT I'VE HAS RUINED EVERYTHING. I'LL CALL YOU IN A FEW DAYS,IF I DON'T HEAR FROM YOU. I LOVE YOU, ALLIE SAM DAY YOU GAVE ME I'M \nAllison reads the letter very attentively. Suddenly she hears some noise coming from the bathroom and turns her head towards the noise. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nThe bathroom door is opening slowly \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison puts the letter back in the envelope, the envelope back into the box. She then puts everything back into the box, closes the box and puts it back on the shelf. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nAllison comes out of her bedroom, picks up her handbag and starts unlocking the safety chains and locks on the front door, while, through the open bathroom door, we see Hedra, wearing a long white shirt, taking care of her hair in front of the mirror. \nHEDRA Do you want me to fix you something before I go ? \nALLISON Oh, no, thanks. I'm just going up and visit Graham. \nHEDRA Okay. \nALLISON Okay. HEDRA I love myself like this. \nALLISON Have fun. \n", "test3_true": "HEDRA Yeah. \nAllison closes the door behind her. \nALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nClose up on the mirror. We see Hedra still fixing her hair \nHEDRA I love myself like this. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT Allison rings the doorbell of Graham's apartment. Getting no answer she knocks on the door. Getting no answer again, she walks away from the door. \nALLISON'S BUILDING - MAIN STAIRCASE - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAllison is going down the stairs. She opens a service door, and, hidden by this door, watches Hedra waiting for the elevator. Allison rushes back to the staircase. \nHigh-angle shot of the whole staircase, with Allison running down. \nNEW YORK - THE STREET OUTSIDE ALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nThis is the street outside Allison's building, probably seen from the entrance of the building, or very near it. \nHedra, coming from behind the camera, crosses the sidewalk, towards the street. \nHEDRA Taxi ! \nShe raises her hand to stop a taxi cab. \nAllison, also coming from behind the camera, hides behind the corner of a wall to watch Hedra. \nHEDRA Hey ! \nA yellow cab stops and Hedra climbs in it. \nAs soon as the cab is gone, Allison rushes from her hiding spot and runs to the street, with her hand raised. \nALLISON Taxi ! \nYELLOW CAB - INTERIOR NIGHT \nWe are inside Allison's cab. In front of us, through the windshield, we see the back of Hedra's cab driving in the heavy traffic of New York. \nALLISON (voice over) Don't lose her. \nReverse angle shot on Allison seated in the back of the cab. Allison bends slightly to speak to the driver. \nALLISON It's very important. She has something of mine. \nNEW-YORK - A QUIET STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nCompared to Allison's neighborhood, this is a very quiet district. Almost no one in the streets. No shops. Hedra's cab has just stopped in front of a grim building with a fire escape. Hedra walks out just as Allison's cab stops at the corner of the street. Allison walks out of her cab. Both cabs drive away, and Allison starts following Hedra from a distance. \nMedium shot of Allison following Hedra. \nHedra reaches her destination, another grim building, and goes down a stairway, starting from the street and going down to the basement of the building. A strong man with a ponytail and glasses is guarding the entrance. But he lets Allison go down the steps. Other people follow Allison. \nBASEMENT NIGHT CLUB - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAllison goes down the last steps to the basement, which actually is a sort of night club. We hear some religious-sounding music with drum rhythms. \nThe place is quite dark, but flashes of light enable us to see that all the customers are very smartly dressed, men wearing elegant suits and neckties, and women wearing elegant dresses. \nThey seem to be watching some sort of a show. \nA young woman, wearing a black sleeveless dress and long black leather gloves, notices Allison and comes towards her. \nTHE WOMAN Do you want to play ? \nALLISON No, thanks. \nAllison walks away, followed by the young woman. She passes near a cage, inside which we see a middle-aged man. The man gets his hand through the bars of the cage, and strokes Allison's cheek. Allison jumps, rubs her cheek and moves away from the cage. Behind Allison's back, we see the young woman, who was following her, coming to the cage and speaking to the man inside. \nFrom where she is, Allison can see what's going on at the bar, without actually be seen by the people seated on high stools along the bar. \nReverse angle shot on the bar itself, and more precisely, on Hedra, seated on a stool, with a man, seated on another stool, stroking her cheek. \nHEDRA Come on, Jim. \nThe bartender, a bald bare-chested young man, turns toward Hedra. \nTHE BARTENDER Allie ! \nHearing her name, Allison starts and looks at the bartender THE BARTENDER (voice over) Hey, Allie ! Regular or diet ? \nHedra turns towards the bartender. \nHEDRA Diet. \nA flash of light enable us to have a better view of Hedra's companion, the man she called \u00abJim\u00bb. He looks a bit like Sam. \nJIM Something's different. \nHedra smiles. \n", "test3_id": 2993}

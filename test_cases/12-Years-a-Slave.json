{"test1_input": "SIGNIFICATION: \nBROWN Hamilton! Nothing more we can do for him. \nHAMILTON Such is the pity. Displaying an odd sort of disappointment, Hamilton slinks away from the bed. He crosses to, and BLOWS OUT A CANDLE. The room goes dark with a blackness more than night. Brown and Hamilton exit. Solomon lays in the dark and moans. His sounds becoming MORE AND MORE \nDISTRESSED. \nINT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - DAWN \n(CONTINUED) \n24 CONTINUED: 24 Solomon stirs, then slowly awakes to his new circumstances. He finds himself in a nearly lightless room about twelve feet square with walls of solid masonry. There is a thick and well-locked door, a small window covered with iron bars and a shutter. The only furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box stove. As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and his LEGS IN IRONS. At first Solomon is incredulous. But that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic. He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them. He does so with increasing desperation. Solomon flails about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and beating against the masonry. He grunts and screams without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his flesh, but he cannot pull himself free. After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires, slows, then finally he collapses. And in this collapsed state he remains. \nINT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - MORNING \nSolomon again awakens. He hears sounds beyond the door...footsteps. Eventually the door opens. Enter JAMES BURCH - who runs the slave pen - and EBENEZER RADBURN who works as a turnkey and overseer. As the door opens, this is the first light to seep into the otherwise near-black room. The shine is painful to Solomon's eyes. With no salutation whatsoever, Burch \nASKS: \nBURCH Well, my boy, how yah feel now? Solomon rises up as best he can. With all the resolve he can put together he states what he considers to be fact: \nSOLOMON I am Solomon Northup. I am a free man; a resident of Saratoga, New York. The residence also of my wife and children who are equally free. I have papers. You have no right whatsoever to detain me-- \nBURCH Yah not any-- \nSOLOMON And I promise you - I promise - upon my liberation I will have satisfaction for this wrong. \nBURCH Resolve this. Produce your papers. \n(CONTINUED) \n25 CONTINUED: 25 With confidence Solomon goes to the pocket of his trousers. He searches one, then the other, but they are empty. He feels quickly about himself, but clearly his papers have been lifted. Solomon's confidence shifts, but to resolve rather than fear. Papers or none, he will not be easily cowed. Still, Burch asserts: \nBURCH (CONT'D) Yah no free man. And yah ain't from Saratoga. Yah from Georgia. A moment. Not a word spoken among the trio, but Solomon and Burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man yielding. Burch says again: \nBURCH (CONT'D) Yah ain't a free man. Yah nuthin' but a Georgia runaway. Burch waits for Solomon to acquiesce. Solomon does not in any way. Both men exchange a long and daring stare. The two are clearly at an intellectual stand off. Burch, leans to Radburn, SAYS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT \nDISTINGUISH. Radburn walks off-camera and returns with a pair of \"instruments:\" a PADDLE - the flattened portion, which is about the size in circumference of two open hands, and bored with a small auger in numerous places. He also carries a WHIP. A cat-o-nine tails; a large rope of many strands. The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the extremity of each. Burch says again: \nBURCH (CONT'D) Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia. Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism. He will say nothing of the kind. As that is the case, Solomon is seized by both men. He is pulled over the bench, face downward, shirt still on his back. Radburn then STEPS ON HIS CHAINS, holding Solomon down in a bent position. With no preamble, Burch begins to beat Solomon about the back with the paddle. Burch strikes him wordlessly - no taunting, no sneering. Solomon screaming against each blow. His back immediately SWELLING WITH WELTS AND \nBRUISES. This beating continues on and on and on until quite literally Burch WEARS HIMSELF OUT with the effort. Dripping in sweat and panting: \n(CONTINUED) \n25 CONTINUED: (2) 25 \nBURCH (CONT'D) Yah still insist yah a free man? \nSOLOMON ...I...I insist... Burch regrets hearing this. Not from sympathy, but rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to beating Solomon. Yet, as if returning to work, Burch returns to pummeling Solomon. Burch punctuates the blows \nWITH: \nBURCH Yah a slave. Yah a Georgia slave! Burch continues to strike, and strike... This time until the paddle SNAPS IN HALF. Burch then GRABS THE WHIP. Hardly missing a stroke, he whips Solomon relentlessly, the flails cutting into Solomon's back. Again, Burch's arm tires before Solomon \"breaks.\" \nBURCH (CONT'D) Are yah slave? \nSOLOMON ...No... Burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping... \nSOLOMON'S BACK IS NOW TORN OPEN WITH LACERATIONS AND OOZING WITH BLOOD. Finally Burch can whip no more. He pours sweat and sucks air, leaving himself just enough energy to take up his instruments and EXIT. Radburn lingers for a moment. He takes the irons off Solomon's legs. Opens the window some. As he makes these gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one wrought with poor sincerity:: \nRADBURN I seen a good many of the black kind just where yah're. Sick. Make me sick. Often times the situation was resolved, and I think; what was all the beatin' and abuse for? Things end as they should, and the violence was for naught. So why cause trouble when they ain't no cause for it? Be of a cooperative nature, and things don't need be particularly unpleasant. \n(BEAT) Or, yah can carry on like yah been, and I fear yah won't live to see Sunday next. With that thought, Radburn exits. Solomon rests. But to rest seems like giving in to defeat. He begins pulling \n(CONTINUED) \n25 CONTINUED: (3) 25 on his chains. But for all his struggling, the chain loosens none. Solomon calls out: \nSOLOMON Help me! Someone help me! If anyone at all hears him, they do not respond. Solomon continues his plaintive cry for assistance. \nEXT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - CONTINUOUS \nBeginning with a TIGHT SHOT on the shuttered, barred window of Burch's dungeon - Solomon's cries barely eking beyond the space - THE CAMERA PULLS BACK from the building, onto the city until clearly visible is the Nation's capital. It's icon's of freedom - the WHITE HOUSE, the CAPITOL BUILDING - fairly mocking Solomon's captivity. Simultaneously, barren at the early hour and cluttered with litter and the remains of previous day's procession, the city is a bleak and forboding sight. \n", "test1_true": "IT IS DAY NOW. The door to the yard is thrown open. The harsh white light floods all over Solomon. \n28 OMITTED 28 \n(CONTINUED) \n28 CONTINUED: 28 \n29 MOVED TO SC. A32 29 \n30 EXT. BURCH'S DUNGEON/YARD - DAY 30 \nIt is a yard just beyond Burch's. The yard is hemmed in by a brick wall. In the yard are two men, and a boy. The oldest is CLEMENS RAY a man of about 25 years of age. He is well educated. JOHN WILLIAMS is about 20 years old. He is born and bred a slave, is lacking in education, and overwhelmed with fear of the situation. Finally there is a child about 10 years of age who answers to the name of Randall. Solomon, Clemens Ray, John and Randall ALL STAND NAKED. Though they try to cover their privates a bit, they are all aware of the uselessness of modesty. Radburn is present. He has before him A COUPLE OF BUCKETS OF COLD WATER. He throws water on the naked men. \nRADBURN Go on. Warsh up. The men, soaking in humility as well as water, begin to scrub with A SINGLE BAR OF HARSH SOAP passed among them. \nRADBURN (CONT'D) The boy, too. Get him clean. Solomon takes some soap and rubs it over Randall. \nRADBURN (CONT'D) Scrub now. Git 'em clean. Solomon scrubs harder. Randall - clearly cold and uncomfortable - appeals to Solomon. \nRANDALL Do you know when my Mama will come? \nRADBURN Hush him up! Seeing Solomon has no answer for him, Randall begins to cry. \nRANDALL Mama ..! Mama! Is she going to come? Doing all he can to spare the child from a certain \nBEATING: \nSOLOMON Quiet, please. Randall is becoming nearly inconsolable. \nRANDALL Mama! \n(CONTINUED) \n21A. \n30 CONTINUED: 30 \nSaying anything to keep the boy quiet: \nSOLOMON Your mother will come, I swear she will, but you must be silent. Please. Be silent! On the seeming strength of Solomon's promise, Randall goes silent. Solomon looks to Radburn, who just throws water on the soapy men. \n31 OMITTED 31 \nA32 INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - EVENING A32 \nRadburn brings food in to Solomon; a shriveled piece of meat and some water. Just barely enough to sustain Solomon. Radburn also has a SHIRT. \nRADBURN That old thing of yours is just rags and tatters. Need something proper to wear. Solomon doesn't move for the clothing. \nRADBURN (CONT'D) Go'won. Put it on. With slow defiance, Solomon does as instructed. He removes what remains of his old shirt - the one he was wearing when first kidnapped - and puts on the one Radburn brought him. The shirt's ill-fitting and dirty. Despite that, Radburn says: \nRADBURN (CONT'D) There. Tha's fine. Tha's fine. Got no gratitude? \nSOLOMON ...Thank you... \nRADBURN Yah keep bein' proper, yah'll see how things work out. Radburn starts to take the old shirt. \nSOLOMON No! It was from my wife. \nRADBURN Rags and tatters. Rags and tatters. Taking the shirt, the \"rags and tatters\" as he calls them, Radburn exits, locking the door behind him. Solomon sits with the plate of food before him. He pushes the plate away rather than eat. \nEXT. BURCH'S DUNGEON/YARD - DAY \nSitting together out in the yard are Clemens Ray, John and Solomon. Over time they have drawn trustworthy enough to speak with one another. At the moment Solomon is still trying to apply reason to the situation. \n(CONTINUED) \n22A. \n32 CONTINUED: 32 Randall wanders about in the background. As usual, he calls out for his \"Mama.\" By now, however, his calls should feel like little more than background noise. \nSOLOMON This can't stand. It is a crime. I believe now someone lay in wait for me. My drink was altered... We are free men. They have...they have no right to hold us. Solomon waits for a response from the others. They give none. \nSOLOMON (CONT'D) We need a sympathetic ear. If we have an opportunity to explain our \n", "test1_id": 1392, "test2_input": "45 CONTINUED: 45 \nCUT TO: Solomon, Clemens Ray and Robert, now in mid-conversation. \nROBERT I say we fight. Robert delivers this in a hushed voice. \nSOLOMON The crew is fairly small. If it were well planned, I believe they could be strong armed. \nCLEMENS RAY Three can't stand against a whole crew. The rest here are niggers, born and bred slaves. Niggers ain't got the stomach for a fight, not a damn one. \nROBERT All I know, we get where we travelling we'll wish we'd died trying. \nCLEMENS RAY Survival is not about certain death, it is about keeping your head down. Solomon looks at Clemens Ray, agitated -- his voice now raised above the previous whispers. Grits his teeth. \nSOLOMON Days ago I was with my family, in my home. Now you tell me all is lost. \"Tell no one who I really am\" if I want to survive. I don't want to survive, I want to live. \n46 OMIT 46 \n47 OMIT 47 \n47A EXT. SEA - DAY 47A \nThe steamboat paddles pound the water, filling the whole frame. The vessel ploughs on south. \n48 OMIT 48 \n48A INT. HOLD - NIGHT 48A \nThe slaves are asleep. A Sailor descends the ladder approaching Eliza. He bends down and attempts to wake the daughter by caressing her face. Solomon rouses, and looks across to witness the scene. From his vantage point, we see Eliza stand to interrupt the Sailor. The Sailor looks at Eliza, Eliza looks back at him. Knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the hold. As she does so, Eliza passes Robert who jumps up to stand between Eliza and the Sailor. Stretching out a firm hand to the sailor's shoulder, Robert's look says \"No you don't.\" Clemens Ray is awake now, watching. There is an odd moment of stillness between the Sailor and Robert, an impasse. We focus on the Sailor's face. Slowly, a greasy smile erupts upon it. Back now to Robert's face, a look of incomprehension. Robert looks down. We follow his gaze to the knife that has already been jabbed unseen between Robert's ribs. The sailor withdraws the bloody blade. A wide shot of the two men. Robert collapses to the floor like a sack of potatoes. Clemens Ray and Solomon react. Complete horror. \n49 OMIT 49 \n50 OMIT 50 \n51 EXT. ORLEANS/DECK - DAY 51 \nWe are back up on the deck of the ship. SOLOMON AND CLEMENS RAY dump ROBERT's body over the side of the ship. Solomon watches as the body churns for a moment in the wake of the vessel... then sinks beneath the water. Clemens Ray, with no sentimentality: \nCLEMENS RAY Better off. Better than us. \n51A EXT. NEW ORLEANS HARBOUR - DAY 51A \nSolomon's POV from the back of the steamship of Robert's corpse slipping gracefully into the water. \n52 EXT. NEW ORLEANS/PORT - DAY 52 \n-MID MAY, 1841- A white male, fairly smart, with broad shoulders, stands \nAND BELLOWS- \nRAY Clemens...! Clemens Ray! We are in the port of New Orleans, one of the busiest in the young nation. On the dock itself there is a bustle of activity as goods are loaded and unloaded from a various ships. It's a bit of controlled chaos as a VARIETY OF LANGUAGES are spoken and shouted while slaves are shuttled from the Orleans to a holding pen. Solomon, and all the slaves are overwhelmed by all that is happening around them. Two men - among many - are awaiting the arrival of the Orleans. They are JONUS RAY - Clemens Ray's master - and DAVIS who is the solicitor of Mr. Ray. They both look like they mean business. The moment the gangplank is laid, Ray yells for Clemens. Clemens, seeing his master, is nearly crazy with delight. He is, uncharacteristically beside himself. Ironically, his master now represents \"freedom.\" \n(CONTINUED) \n52 CONTINUED: 52 \nCLEMENS ...My master... Master Ray, sir! Master Ray! Clemens pulls on his chain. As he does so, Several other slaves collapse in his effort to reach his master, like dominos. \nRAY Who is in charge of this vessel? \nCAPTAIN I am the Captain. \nRAY I am Mr. Jonus Ray. My solicitor has documentation verifying that the Negro named Clemens Ray is my property. As he reads PAPERS handed to him by Davis: \nCAPTAIN I know nothing of-- \nRAY You are ordered by court to return that property immediately, or face charges of thievery. \nCAPTAIN My duty is to transport goods. I am not responsible for their origin. \nRAY Remove these contraptions! To his mate: \nCAPTAIN Free him! Biddee does as ordered. Once free, Clemens hugs and sobs over his master as would a lost and then found child. \nRAY It's all well, now, Clemens. You will return home with me. (to the Captain) Consider this notice and warning. \n", "test2_true": "52 CONTINUED: (2) 52 Ray, Davis and Clemens head away. Solomon seems both desperate and hopeful of some aid from Clemens and Ray. But there is none forthcoming. Ray and Clemens continue on - Clemens not so much as even looking back in Solomon's direction. Solomon stands and watches as they fade into the environs and are gone from sight. \nEXT. NEW ORLEANS/PORT - LATER \nHours later. The slaves sit off on one side of the dock, baking in the sun, awaiting their fate. THEOPHILUS FREEMAN - a tall, thin-faced man with light complexion and a little bent - moves along the deck calling out names from a list. The slaves STAND as they are called. \nFREEMAN Oren. John. Lethe. Eliza. Randall. Emily. Platt... Platt! Solomon does not respond. Freeman looks around. He spots Solomon. \nFREEMAN (CONT'D) Captain, who shipped that nigger? \nCAPTAIN Burch. Freeman steps to Solomon. He gives him a looking over. \nFREEMAN Stand up. Solomon does as told. \nFREEMAN (CONT'D) You fit the description given. Why didn't you answer when called? \nSOLOMON My name is not Platt. My name is-- Freeman strikes Solomon hard across the face. \nFREEMAN Your name is Platt, and I will teach you your name so that you don't forget. (to the Captain) Shackle my niggers. Get them to my cart. \n54 I/E. CART - LATER 54 Solomon is carted off along with the rest of \"Burch's stock:\" Eliza and her children, John and Solomon. As they move off from the port in a make-shift cart, it opens up to the frenzic, busy port. For the first time Solomon sees true and severe slavery. These are not visiting servants, such as Jasper was back in Saratoga. These are humans held in strict bondage - herded like cattle, chained together as if in a \"chain gang.\" Slaves are evident not merely by the color of their skin. The residue and accessories of slavery are everywhere. Blacks almost universally display scars - \nTHICK AND HEAVY DEAD TISSUE FROM LACERATIONS LEFT UNTREATED - brands, and are often missing limbs. Blacks are held in all types of shackles, from simple chains to elaborate bindings, to neck collars that are spiked. Some are muzzled or forced to wear bits. One slave is attacked by a dog and the slave owner. The dog pulls and tears at the slave's clothes. THESE IMAGES SHOULD BE A \nCONSTANT AND CONTINUAL CANVAS TO THE PIECE. EVER \nPRESENT, BUT NOT REALLY COMMENTED ON AS THEY ARE THE NORM. They should be a reminder that not only are people being oppressed, but that there is an entire system of oppression in place. \nEXT. FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER \n\"Burch's stock:\" arrive at Freeman's slave pen. They are led in by Freeman and his house slave CAPE - a mulatto. The yard is enclosed by plank, standing upright, with ends sharpened instead of brick walls as with Burch's. Including Burch's group there are about 30 SLAVES in the pen. Solomon and the others look around and see nothing but downtrodden and despondent faces. Three men sit next to each other with muzzles and quietly stare back at this new batch of arrivals. One attempts to speak, but all that comes out is a muffled, unintelligible sound. \nEXT. FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER \nThe slaves are in various states of undress, men and women alike. They clean themselves, scrubbing with soap and water. Women wash their hair. Men shave, skin is oiled. Freeman walks among them, inspecting them as they primp themselves. \nINT. FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER \nThe slaves are given new clothes by Cape. The men are given hat, coat, shirt, pants and shoes. The women \n(CONTINUED) \n57 CONTINUED: 57 frocks of calico and handkerchiefs to bind about their heads. \n58 INT. FREEMAN'S/GREAT ROOM - LATER 58 \nIt's an odd, ironic scene. The slaves are in a large and fairly ornate room within Freeman's house. CAPE PLAYS A PAINFUL TUNE ON A FIDDLE - background music - as Freeman tries to line up A SMALL GROUP OF THE SLAVES, he becomes less patient, jittery and nervous, knowing that his livelihood is at stake, he wants his slaves to make a good impression. Sometimes his patience gets the better of him, and his hands move freely in direction of the slaves. The business has the air of an etiquette class, though what Freeman is trying to do is coach the slaves into being more \"sellable.\" He works with them in groups of five or so. \nFREEMAN Tallest to smallest, understand? Are you taller than her? Then you'd go before her. Do it. Move. (to the group) Keep your heads up. A sense of direction; that's how you look smart. None of those saucer eyes. Rid yourself of that smile. Look like a goddamn grinnin' monkey. Put the least thought in your head. C'mon, now. Think of somethin'. Weary of Cape's playing, Solomon moves to Cape. He asks: \nSOLOMON Can you play a reel? \nCAPE \n(DISMISSIVE) Nah. I don't know no reel. \nSOLOMON If I may...? Cape looks to Freeman: \nFREEMAN He sick of your caterwaulin'. Let him play, boy. Let's see what he can do. Cape reluctantly hands the fiddle over to Solomon. Solomon tunes it a bit, then begins to play. His fingers stiff at first, he takes a moment to warm up. But as he warms up he is, despite the circumstances, masterful. \n(CONTINUED) \n58 CONTINUED: 58 THE SLAVES ALL CLAP ALONG. SOME DANCE ALONG. All admire his work. Freeman chief among them. \nFREEMAN (CONT'D) Keep on. Keep on. Solomon continues to play. \nFREEMAN (CONT'D) A damn sight better than you, Cape. A damn sight better. Cape looks bitter as Solomon plays on. \nINT. FREEMAN'S/GREAT ROOM - DAY \nWe come in on an odd sort of sight; A JUMBLE OF ACTIVITY. CUSTOMERS have come to see Freeman's lot - the room all gussied up with flowers. Freeman moves among them, displaying them as a rancher would prize chattel. Freeman makes the slaves hold their heads up - \"look smart\" as he previously admonished them. They are made to walk briskly back and forth while customers feel their hands and arms and bodies, turn them about and ask what skills they possess. The Customers routinely make the slaves open their mouths and show their teeth. At times a MALE or FEMALE SLAVE are taken off to the side, stripped and inspected more minutely. One of them, John, is stripped and inspected. Cape, as he's done previously, plays his fiddle. A buyer - WILLIAM FORD; a man of middle age, and an attractive nature in his tone of voice - consults a list he's drawn up and asks of Freeman: \nFORD What is the price for the ones Platt and Eliza? \nFREEMAN A thousand for Platt; he is a nigger of talent. Seven hundred for Eliza. My fairest price. \n", "test2_id": 1393, "test3_input": "SOLOMON ...Sir... The Sheriff crosses to him. \nSHERIFF Your name is Platt, is it? \nSOLOMON Yes, sir. Pointing off to the distance. \nSHERIFF Do you know that man? \n(CONTINUED) \n118A. \n168 CONTINUED: 168 Solomon looks toward the carriage. He has to shield his eyes from the sun. Recognition is slow coming to him. But when it does, it hits him as a rush. \nSOLOMON Mr. Parker...? \n(CONTINUED) \n168 CONTINUED: (2) 168 Solomon starts for Parker, but he is pulled back by the Sheriff who is keen to determine Solomon's true identity. \nSHERIFF Say again? \nSOLOMON Mr. Parker? As he does, Epps makes his way over. \nSHERIFF That man received a letter compiling many accusations. You look me in the eye and on your life answer me truthfully: have you any other name than Platt? \nSOLOMON Solomon Northup is my name. \nEPPS Sheriff... \nSHERIFF Have you a family? \nEPPS What's all this? \nSHERIFF It's official business. \nEPPS My nigger, my business. \nSHERIFF Your business waits. \n(TO SOLOMON) Tell me of your family. \nSOLOMON I have a wife and two children. \nSHERIFF What were your children's names? \nSOLOMON Margaret and Alonzo. \nSHERIFF And your wife's name before her marriage? \nSOLOMON Anne Hampton. I am who I say. Solomon pushes past the sheriff. As Solomon moves toward Parker, his pace quickens with each step until his \n(CONTINUED) \n119A. \n168 CONTINUED: (3) 168 personal velocity has him nearly at a dead run. The two old friends make contact with each other, wrap each other in a long and emotional embrace. It if finally broken by Epps, who has moved over with the Sheriff. \n(CONTINUED) \n168 CONTINUED: (4) 168 \nEPPS Nah... You will unhand 'em. Platt is my nigger! \nPARKER He is Solomon Northup. \nEPPS You say... \nPARKER He belongs to no man. \nEPPS You say! You come here, unfamiliar to me, and make claims. \nSHERIFF Not claims. I have no doubts. This is Solomon Northup, a resident of Saratoga Springs, NY. \nEPPS To hell with that! My nigger, and I'll fight you for 'em! \n", "test3_true": "BACK DOWN: \nEPPS You think this is the last you'll see of me, boy? It ain't. \n(TO PARKER) Whatever paper you hold about his freedom, it don't mean naught. He is my nigger - and I will have my day in court, sir. As God as my witness, I will have my day in court. Take 'em! Epps calls to Bob- \n(CONTINUED) \n120A. \n168 CONTINUED: (5) 168 \nEPPS (CONT'D) Saddle my horse! And bring her up here. Epps walks back into the plantation. The trio starts for the carriage. Solomon is pulled back by the call of Patsey's voice: \nPATSEY Platt... Disregarding Parker, Solomon crosses over to Patsey. Under the circumstances, neither really knows how to engage. Finally, suddenly, Patsey throws her arms around Solomon and they embrace. Epps, now mounted on his horse, witness the encounter. Kicking the stirrups hard into the sides of the horse, he rides off furiously. Calling from the carriage, mindful of Epps: \nPARKER Solomon...if we know what's wise, we should depart. A moment longer Solomon and Patsey hold each other. They separate, Solomon heading back to the carriage. He and Parker alight. The Sheriff chides the horses and they \n(CONTINUED) \n168 CONTINUED: (6) 168 start up. As they move on, Patsey sinks down to the ground, where she remains in a weary and half-reclining state, the other slaves around her. WE STAY WITH Solomon as he travels further and further from the slaves - who are diminished by distance. Solomon waves a hand to them, but the carriage rounds a bend and a thicket of trees hides them from his eyes forever more. \nBLACK \nA169 A169 \nEXT. NORTHUP HOUSE - DAY \n-MARCH, 1853- We now see Solomon in front of a door. A door we have seen before at the very beginning of our story. Solomon, aged significantly since then, stands nervously, swallowing, and adjusting his attire. He breaths in and holds his breath. He blows out and closes his eyes. A tear falls from his cheek, but this is not the way he wants his family to see him. He gathers himself, and looks to his right. There stands Mr. Parker. He places his hand on Solomon's shoulder. He says gently- \nPARKER Are you ready? Solomon swallows and nods. \nINT. NORTHUP HOUSE - LATER \nTHE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPENS. Mr. Parker enters, Solomon behind. We first see Anne, in her finest attire; the Northup children: Alonzo, who is now seventeen and Margaret who is now twenty - SHE CARRIES WITH HER A BUNDLE. Also present is MARGARET'S HUSBAND. The family waits patiently, dutifully...but anxiously. Anne rises to greet him, but holds back. All around, the body language of the family is stiff and awkward. They are, after all - after twelve years - little more than familiar strangers. \nSOLOMON I apologize for my appearance. I have had a difficult time of things these past many years. Solomon looks among his family; trying to recall them as much as they look to see familiarity within him. To his \nCHILDREN: \nSOLOMON (CONT'D) Alonzo... Margaret, yes? You do not recognize me, do you? Do \n(MORE) (CONTINUED) \n169 CONTINUED: 169 \nSOLOMON (CONT'D) you...do you even remember the last time we saw each other? I put you on a carriage with your mother... Margaret, tearing, hugs her father. Solomon almost breaks, but he keeps himself together. Looking to the \nUNKNOWN MAN: \nSOLOMON (CONT'D) And who is this? \nMARGARET He is my husband. \nSOLOMON Husband? \nMARGARET'S HUSBAND It is very good to meet you, sir. \nSOLOMON We have much acquainting to do. Margaret rises, she presents her bundle to her father. \nMARGARET And this is your grandson. Solomon Northup Staunton. \nSOLOMON ...Solomon... The fact his grandson carries his name, is overwhelming. Solomon breaks down. Emotionally, physically... But ANNE IS THERE TO CATCH HIM. As she holds him, Solomon says to Anne with all his heart: \nSOLOMON (CONT'D) Forgive me. \nANNE There is nothing to forgive. The pair, joined now by the whole family, hold on to each other for life...and one would think for all the rest of their lives. \nFADE TO: \nBLACK \nCARD: Upon gaining his freedom, Solomon Northup located and attempted to seek legal justice against the men who kidnapped him.

{"train": "12 YEARS A SLAVE \nWritten by \nJohn Ridley \nCARD: 1841 \nFADE IN: \n1 INT. TOWNHOUSE/STUDY - DAY 1 \n-EARLY APRIL, 1841- We are close on a PAIR OF BLACK HANDS as they open A \nFINELY WRAPPED PACKET OF VIOLIN STRINGS. \nWE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN. It's not a high end piece, but it is quite nice. \nWE CUT TO a wide shot of the study. Sitting in a chair with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late twenties. Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner, is distinguished. But he, too, seems a hardy individual. Someone who has known manual labor in his time. \nSolomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing the strings, their tuning. Satisfied, Solomon begins to play vigorously. As he does, we make a HARD CUT TO: \nINT. HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nWe come in on a lively affair. A dinner party is being thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house. In attendance are EIGHT COUPLES. All are WHITE and all are FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties. The men and women are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense that for the most part they are people of means. \nThe furniture has been set aside in the living room. At the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a REEL. \nThe music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon, having cut directly from the tune he was previously playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no way seems possessed with empty servitude. \nSolomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal thanks and congratulations from all. It should be clear that despite their respective races there is much admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities. \nINT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM - MORNING \nIt is a Saturday morning. Clad in her finest attire is ANNE; Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he. We see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and ALONZO who is five. They are handsome, and well groomed kids. Anne straightens up the children. She finishes, \n(CONTINUED) \n3 CONTINUED: 3 she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if preparing to pose for a portrait. They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer. He stands and looks admiringly at his family. ADMIRINGLY stressed. It isn't that he doesn't have love for them, he does as well. But in the moment, he truly admires his greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and well and provided for. He goes to his children, and hands each a coin, then goes to Anne. Gives her a kiss on the cheek. The children giggle at the sight. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nSolomon and his family are out walking along the streets and groves of Saratoga. \nThe streets are well populated this morning with many people out strolling. Most are WHITE, but there are BLACKS as well. They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly easily - though not always completely - with the whites. We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their WHITE MASTERS. These pairings are largely from the south and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are not physically downtrodden, not field hands. They are well dressed and \"leading apparently an easy life\" - comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters. \nAs they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart traffic. Solomon and his children easily jump across the muck. Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for Solomon to help her across. \nANNE Solomon... Solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile waving her forward: \nSOLOMON Come, Anne. Jump. \nThe children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on. \nALONZO MARGARET Jump. You can make it. I've done it. You can make it. \nANNE I will not ruin my dress. Catch me! \nSolomon moves close, holds out his arms. Yet, there's still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes. Anne gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon replies. \n(CONTINUED) \nSOLOMON I will catch you, Anne. \n(BEAT) I will. Again, lightly stern: \nANNE You will. \nAnd with that Anne takes the leap. Solomon catches her, swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to the delighted applause of the children. That done, Solomon takes Anne's hand and leads her on. \nAs Solomon and his family make their way, among the slaves on the street, we see one in particular; JASPER. As he trails his MASTER he can't help but note Solomon and his family as they enter A STORE. His intrigue of this most handsome and harmonious group should be obvious. \nWith his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the STORE. Frozen on the spot, Jasper looks on admiringly. Suddenly a voice barks out- \nA VOICE (O.S.) Jasper! Come on! \n(MORE) (CONTINUED) \n5A. \n6 CONTINUED: 6 \nSOLOMON (CONT'D) people raised to fill the highest place of trust within their gift. William Henry Harrison.\" A long moment of quiet, the family continuing to eat. Then, from Margaret: \nMARGARET Will you read it again? \nANNE Not just now, darling. Anne enters the dining room and places a large chicken at the center of the table. As she takes a seat, all heads are bowed. \nMARGARET For food that stays our hunger, For rest that brings us ease, For homes where memories linger, We give our thanks for these. \nALL Amen. \nSOLOMON Margaret, that was wonderful. \nMARGARET Thank you, Papa. \nSOLOMON Alonzo, do you have something to say? \nALONZO Yes, I helped Momma make this. \nANNE Yes, and you were such a good help. Especially making the gravy. \nMARGARET Papa, I would very much like to learn how to play the violin. Could you teach me? \nALONZO Me too! \nMARGARET Yes, but I asked Papa first. \nSOLOMON Both of you, calm down. We will have our first lesson after this wonderful dinner. And on that note, let's start eating. \n(CONTINUED) \n5B. \n6 CONTINUED: (2) 6 The family all tuck in to their meal. The scene is one of warmth and happiness. \n7 INT. NORTHUP HOUSE - NIGHT 7 \nSolomon and Anne have fun and difficulty putting the unruly children to bed. They are tucked in, and each given a kiss good night. As Margaret lays down to sleep, Anne blows out the candle darkening the room. Silhouetted in the doorway, Solomon takes Anne in his arms, holds her tightly as they both luxuriate in the simple, beautiful gift that is their children. \n7A 7A \nINT. NORTHUP HOUSE - NIGHT \nNow alone together, we see Anne and Solomon wrapped in each other's arms. Beyond being physically close, emotionally close, they are just so very comfortable with one another. They are the very representation of a couple who are made for each other. \nThey look at each other for a prolonged time. \nSOLOMON \n(COMICALLY FORLORN) Three weeks. Two days. \nANNE It is the custom. I wonder what you'll do without me? \nSOLOMON I won't stay idle. SOLOMON's eyes lower. \nANNE Darling, it's good money. \nSOLOMON If only I didn't have to share your cooking with other people. ANNE holds his gaze. \nANNE You don't. They kiss. \n8 OMIT 8 \n9 EXT. NORTHUP HOUSE - MORNING 9 \nWe are just outside the Northup house. A CARRIAGE waits with a DRIVER. Anne and the children are dressed for travel - Anne sporting HER NEW CARRY ALL. The Driver loads bags into the carriage. For her parting gift, Anne gives her husband a kiss. \nSOLOMON Travel safely. \nANNE Stay safely. Anne and the children loaded up, the Driver chides the horse and the carriage heads off. Solomon waves a hearty good bye to his wife and children. \n13 INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/STUDY - LATER 13 \nSolomon sits down to write a letter; pen poised over paper with already a few lines written. But Solomon thinks better of it. WITH LITTLE THOUGHT HE TEARS THE \nPAPER AND SETS IT ASIDE. WE SHOULD GET THE SENSE THAT \nTHE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE BY LETTER \nIS LOST ON SOLOMON. THIS FACT WILL HAVE GREAT WEIGHT IN \nTHE NEAR FUTURE. \nEXT. SOLOMON'S HOUSE/INT. COVERED CARRIAGE - LATER \nSolomon enters the buggy, carpet bag in hand. Brown and Hamilton are waiting. They ride in a covered carriage led by a pair of \"noble\" horses. \nHAMILTON No letter to post? \nSOLOMON No need. My return will coincide with my family's. \nBROWN We're off then. \nINT. PUB - EVENING \n-MID TO LATE APRIL, 1841- We find ourselves in a roadside pub. It serves the purpose of drinking and diversion, and little more. As Solomon plays his violin, Brown and Hamilton perform a decent, paired magic routine before a SPARSE AUDIENCE NOT \nOF \"SELECT CHARACTER.\" \n16 INT. PUB - LATER 16 \nAfter the show, the pub now fairly empty, Solomon, Hamilton and Brown sit down to eat. Hamilton and Brown drink, but again Solomon abstains. Though Solomon remains cool, Hamilton and Brown put up a great show of being disappointed as Hamilton counts out what little money was collected. \nHAMILTON Not an additional tip from a one of them. They expect to be entertained for nothing. \nBROWN And not satisfied a bit despite giving them more than what they paid for. \nSOLOMON It's the national mood. There's too much grief to make room for frivolity. \nHAMILTON My sincerest apologies, Solomon. You were promised opportunity, and you were given none. \nBROWN The opportunity is with the circus. A two man show poorly promoted, what were we to expect? But the circus bills itself. \nHAMILTON True. \nBROWN I have told you of the circus with which we are connected. Creatures from the darkest of Africa. Acrobats from the Orient who-- \nSOLOMON You have described it, yes. \nBROWN Yes. We need to return immediately to Washington. Solomon...I believe us familiar enough now, but forgive me if I am bold...would you consider making the trip with us? Solomon gives a bit of a laugh at the idea. \n(CONTINUED) \n16 CONTINUED: 16 \nHAMILTON Entertaining at pubs and inns has it's place, but a man of your skills deserves better. \nBROWN Hear, hear. \nHAMILTON And more importantly you would build your own name and following. The circus tends to attract those with the highest of reputations. An introduction here and there could amount to a lifetime of reward. Now would be the time. With your family away, an opportunity presents itself. \nBROWN Said as fellow artists as well as businessmen. Well worth the effort at least. \nSOLOMON You present a flattering representation. As my family will be traveling back shortly, perhaps I might commit only to one trial engagement. \nHAMILTON Oh, very good, sir. Very good. I cannot recall being so excited. \nBROWN There is a practical concern. If you are to continue on with us you should obtain your free papers. \nSOLOMON Not necessary. \nBROWN Here in New York, no. But we will be entering slave states and as a matter of precaution... It's to all our benefit we should not have to come to account for your well being. \nHAMILTON Six shillings worth of effort could well save much trouble later. \n(CONTINUED) \nSIGNIFICATION: \nBROWN Hamilton! Nothing more we can do for him. \nHAMILTON Such is the pity. Displaying an odd sort of disappointment, Hamilton slinks away from the bed. He crosses to, and BLOWS OUT A CANDLE. The room goes dark with a blackness more than night. Brown and Hamilton exit. Solomon lays in the dark and moans. His sounds becoming MORE AND MORE \nDISTRESSED. \nINT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - DAWN \n(CONTINUED) \n24 CONTINUED: 24 Solomon stirs, then slowly awakes to his new circumstances. He finds himself in a nearly lightless room about twelve feet square with walls of solid masonry. There is a thick and well-locked door, a small window covered with iron bars and a shutter. The only furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box stove. As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and his LEGS IN IRONS. At first Solomon is incredulous. But that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic. He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them. He does so with increasing desperation. Solomon flails about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and beating against the masonry. He grunts and screams without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his flesh, but he cannot pull himself free. After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires, slows, then finally he collapses. And in this collapsed state he remains. \nINT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - MORNING \nSolomon again awakens. He hears sounds beyond the door...footsteps. Eventually the door opens. Enter JAMES BURCH - who runs the slave pen - and EBENEZER RADBURN who works as a turnkey and overseer. As the door opens, this is the first light to seep into the otherwise near-black room. The shine is painful to Solomon's eyes. With no salutation whatsoever, Burch \nASKS: \nBURCH Well, my boy, how yah feel now? Solomon rises up as best he can. With all the resolve he can put together he states what he considers to be fact: \nSOLOMON I am Solomon Northup. I am a free man; a resident of Saratoga, New York. The residence also of my wife and children who are equally free. I have papers. You have no right whatsoever to detain me-- \nBURCH Yah not any-- \nSOLOMON And I promise you - I promise - upon my liberation I will have satisfaction for this wrong. \nBURCH Resolve this. Produce your papers. \n(CONTINUED) \n25 CONTINUED: 25 With confidence Solomon goes to the pocket of his trousers. He searches one, then the other, but they are empty. He feels quickly about himself, but clearly his papers have been lifted. Solomon's confidence shifts, but to resolve rather than fear. Papers or none, he will not be easily cowed. Still, Burch asserts: \nBURCH (CONT'D) Yah no free man. And yah ain't from Saratoga. Yah from Georgia. A moment. Not a word spoken among the trio, but Solomon and Burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man yielding. Burch says again: \nBURCH (CONT'D) Yah ain't a free man. Yah nuthin' but a Georgia runaway. Burch waits for Solomon to acquiesce. Solomon does not in any way. Both men exchange a long and daring stare. The two are clearly at an intellectual stand off. Burch, leans to Radburn, SAYS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT \nDISTINGUISH. Radburn walks off-camera and returns with a pair of \"instruments:\" a PADDLE - the flattened portion, which is about the size in circumference of two open hands, and bored with a small auger in numerous places. He also carries a WHIP. A cat-o-nine tails; a large rope of many strands. The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the extremity of each. Burch says again: \nBURCH (CONT'D) Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia. Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism. He will say nothing of the kind. As that is the case, Solomon is seized by both men. He is pulled over the bench, face downward, shirt still on his back. Radburn then STEPS ON HIS CHAINS, holding Solomon down in a bent position. With no preamble, Burch begins to beat Solomon about the back with the paddle. Burch strikes him wordlessly - no taunting, no sneering. Solomon screaming against each blow. His back immediately SWELLING WITH WELTS AND \nBRUISES. This beating continues on and on and on until quite literally Burch WEARS HIMSELF OUT with the effort. Dripping in sweat and panting: \n(CONTINUED) \n25 CONTINUED: (2) 25 \nBURCH (CONT'D) Yah still insist yah a free man? \nSOLOMON ...I...I insist... Burch regrets hearing this. Not from sympathy, but rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to beating Solomon. Yet, as if returning to work, Burch returns to pummeling Solomon. Burch punctuates the blows \nWITH: \nBURCH Yah a slave. Yah a Georgia slave! Burch continues to strike, and strike... This time until the paddle SNAPS IN HALF. Burch then GRABS THE WHIP. Hardly missing a stroke, he whips Solomon relentlessly, the flails cutting into Solomon's back. Again, Burch's arm tires before Solomon \"breaks.\" \nBURCH (CONT'D) Are yah slave? \nSOLOMON ...No... Burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping... \nSOLOMON'S BACK IS NOW TORN OPEN WITH LACERATIONS AND OOZING WITH BLOOD. Finally Burch can whip no more. He pours sweat and sucks air, leaving himself just enough energy to take up his instruments and EXIT. Radburn lingers for a moment. He takes the irons off Solomon's legs. Opens the window some. As he makes these gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one wrought with poor sincerity:: \nRADBURN I seen a good many of the black kind just where yah're. Sick. Make me sick. Often times the situation was resolved, and I think; what was all the beatin' and abuse for? Things end as they should, and the violence was for naught. So why cause trouble when they ain't no cause for it? Be of a cooperative nature, and things don't need be particularly unpleasant. \n(BEAT) Or, yah can carry on like yah been, and I fear yah won't live to see Sunday next. With that thought, Radburn exits. Solomon rests. But to rest seems like giving in to defeat. He begins pulling \n(CONTINUED) \n25 CONTINUED: (3) 25 on his chains. But for all his struggling, the chain loosens none. Solomon calls out: \nSOLOMON Help me! Someone help me! If anyone at all hears him, they do not respond. Solomon continues his plaintive cry for assistance. \nEXT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - CONTINUOUS \nBeginning with a TIGHT SHOT on the shuttered, barred window of Burch's dungeon - Solomon's cries barely eking beyond the space - THE CAMERA PULLS BACK from the building, onto the city until clearly visible is the Nation's capital. It's icon's of freedom - the WHITE HOUSE, the CAPITOL BUILDING - fairly mocking Solomon's captivity. Simultaneously, barren at the early hour and cluttered with litter and the remains of previous day's procession, the city is a bleak and forboding sight. \nSITUATION-- \nCLEMENS Who in your estimation is that sympathetic ear? \nSOLOMON The two men I journeyed with. I'm certain they're making inquires at this very moment. \nCLEMENS I would be just as certain they are counting the money paid for delivering you to this place. \nSOLOMON They were not kidnappers. They were artists. Fellow performers. \nCLEMENS You know that? You know for certain who they were? \n(CONTINUED) \n32 CONTINUED: (2) 32 The fact is, Solomon can't say for certain. \nCLEMENS (CONT'D) How I reckon the situation: whatever past we had...well, that's done now. The reality to come is us being transported southward. New Orleans if I were to venture. After we arrive, we'll be put to market. Beyond that... Well, once in a slave state I suppose there's only one outcome. \nJOHN No. \nCLEMENS I don't say that to give you empty agitation, John... \nJOHN For y'all. For y'all they ain't nothin' but that! But John was'n kidnapped. John bein' hold as debt, tha's all. Massa pay his debt, and John be redeemed-- \nCLEMENS Boy, our masters will not come for us. John is nearly beside himself with panic. \nJOHN Now John's...John's sorry for y'all, but tha's how it be. Where y'all goin', yah goin' witout John. Massa take care of me. Massa take care. \nRANDALL Mama! All three men turn and look. At the moment Randall doesn't call out emptily. At the door to the yard is Burch along with two women. One in her late twenties; ELIZA. She is \"arrayed in silk, with rings upon her fingers, and golden ornaments suspended from her ears.\" Though a slave, Eliza was a mistress and has - to this point - lived well. This is reflected in her airs and her speech. The other is a little girl, light in skin color, of about seven or eight. This is EMILY, Randall's half sister. As she enters the yard Eliza squeals with high delight, then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy. Clearly this is mother and child being reunited. \n(CONTINUED) \n32 CONTINUED: (3) 32 As Burch locks the yard door, Eliza clutches Randall. She is overcome with emotion. \nELIZA My darling. My sweet, sweet baby. \nINT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - EVENING \nLater in the evening. Solomon now shares his space with Eliza and her children. As the children rest, Eliza drops into a lament as if pleading her case to Solomon who lends a sympathetic ear. \nBoth slyly, and with a bit of aggrandizement: \nELIZA When I say I had my master's favor, you understand. Above even his own wife, I had it. Do you know that he built a house for me? Built it on the sole condition that I reside there with him. The added promise in time I would be emancipated. And for nine years he blessed me with every comfort and luxury in life. Displaying the finery she still wears: \nELIZA (CONT'D) Silks and jewels and even servants to wait upon us. Such was our life, and the life of this beautiful girl I bore for him. But Master Berry's daughter...she always looked at me with an unkind nature. She hated Emily no matter she and Emily were flesh of flesh. As Master Berry's health failed, she gained power in the household. Eventually, I was brought to the city on the false pretense of our free papers being executed. If I had known what waited; to be sent south? I swear I would not have come here alive. \n(CONTINUED) \n33 CONTINUED: 33 Eliza turns to her children: \nELIZA (CONT'D) My poor, poor babies. \n34 INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - NIGHT 34 \nIt's the deep of night, all are sleeping. A KEY TURNS IN THE LOCK AND THE DOOR OPENS. Burch enters with Radburn beside him. Both carry LANTERNS with them. Hardly giving Solomon and Eliza a moment to rouse themselves, \nBURCH DEMANDS: \nBURCH Come on. Get yer blankets. Get up. Sensing that things will not end well: \nELIZA No, please don't... \nBURCH I don't want to hear yer talk. Get in the yard. \nELIZA Please... \nRADBURN Ain't no need for all that. Putting hand to Randall's head. \nRADBURN (CONT'D) Jus takin' a li'l trip, tha's all. Don't want to frighten the chil'ren none over a li'l boat ride, do yah? Eliza gives a shake of her head to the negative. \nRADBURN (CONT'D) Alright then. Git yerselves up. \nEXT. BURCH'S DUNGEON/YARD - NIGHT \nWe now have Solomon, Clemens, John, Eliza and the children. They are being cuffed together. As John is cuffed, he pulls back. Scared. He beings in \n45 CONTINUED: 45 \nCUT TO: Solomon, Clemens Ray and Robert, now in mid-conversation. \nROBERT I say we fight. Robert delivers this in a hushed voice. \nSOLOMON The crew is fairly small. If it were well planned, I believe they could be strong armed. \nCLEMENS RAY Three can't stand against a whole crew. The rest here are niggers, born and bred slaves. Niggers ain't got the stomach for a fight, not a damn one. \nROBERT All I know, we get where we travelling we'll wish we'd died trying. \nCLEMENS RAY Survival is not about certain death, it is about keeping your head down. Solomon looks at Clemens Ray, agitated -- his voice now raised above the previous whispers. Grits his teeth. \nSOLOMON Days ago I was with my family, in my home. Now you tell me all is lost. \"Tell no one who I really am\" if I want to survive. I don't want to survive, I want to live. \n46 OMIT 46 \n47 OMIT 47 \n47A EXT. SEA - DAY 47A \nThe steamboat paddles pound the water, filling the whole frame. The vessel ploughs on south. \n48 OMIT 48 \n48A INT. HOLD - NIGHT 48A \nThe slaves are asleep. A Sailor descends the ladder approaching Eliza. He bends down and attempts to wake the daughter by caressing her face. Solomon rouses, and looks across to witness the scene. From his vantage point, we see Eliza stand to interrupt the Sailor. The Sailor looks at Eliza, Eliza looks back at him. Knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the hold. As she does so, Eliza passes Robert who jumps up to stand between Eliza and the Sailor. Stretching out a firm hand to the sailor's shoulder, Robert's look says \"No you don't.\" Clemens Ray is awake now, watching. There is an odd moment of stillness between the Sailor and Robert, an impasse. We focus on the Sailor's face. Slowly, a greasy smile erupts upon it. Back now to Robert's face, a look of incomprehension. Robert looks down. We follow his gaze to the knife that has already been jabbed unseen between Robert's ribs. The sailor withdraws the bloody blade. A wide shot of the two men. Robert collapses to the floor like a sack of potatoes. Clemens Ray and Solomon react. Complete horror. \n49 OMIT 49 \n50 OMIT 50 \n51 EXT. ORLEANS/DECK - DAY 51 \nWe are back up on the deck of the ship. SOLOMON AND CLEMENS RAY dump ROBERT's body over the side of the ship. Solomon watches as the body churns for a moment in the wake of the vessel... then sinks beneath the water. Clemens Ray, with no sentimentality: \nCLEMENS RAY Better off. Better than us. \n51A EXT. NEW ORLEANS HARBOUR - DAY 51A \nSolomon's POV from the back of the steamship of Robert's corpse slipping gracefully into the water. \n52 EXT. NEW ORLEANS/PORT - DAY 52 \n-MID MAY, 1841- A white male, fairly smart, with broad shoulders, stands \nAND BELLOWS- \nRAY Clemens...! Clemens Ray! We are in the port of New Orleans, one of the busiest in the young nation. On the dock itself there is a bustle of activity as goods are loaded and unloaded from a various ships. It's a bit of controlled chaos as a VARIETY OF LANGUAGES are spoken and shouted while slaves are shuttled from the Orleans to a holding pen. Solomon, and all the slaves are overwhelmed by all that is happening around them. Two men - among many - are awaiting the arrival of the Orleans. They are JONUS RAY - Clemens Ray's master - and DAVIS who is the solicitor of Mr. Ray. They both look like they mean business. The moment the gangplank is laid, Ray yells for Clemens. Clemens, seeing his master, is nearly crazy with delight. He is, uncharacteristically beside himself. Ironically, his master now represents \"freedom.\" \n(CONTINUED) \n52 CONTINUED: 52 \nCLEMENS ...My master... Master Ray, sir! Master Ray! Clemens pulls on his chain. As he does so, Several other slaves collapse in his effort to reach his master, like dominos. \nRAY Who is in charge of this vessel? \nCAPTAIN I am the Captain. \nRAY I am Mr. Jonus Ray. My solicitor has documentation verifying that the Negro named Clemens Ray is my property. As he reads PAPERS handed to him by Davis: \nCAPTAIN I know nothing of-- \nRAY You are ordered by court to return that property immediately, or face charges of thievery. \nCAPTAIN My duty is to transport goods. I am not responsible for their origin. \nRAY Remove these contraptions! To his mate: \nCAPTAIN Free him! Biddee does as ordered. Once free, Clemens hugs and sobs over his master as would a lost and then found child. \nRAY It's all well, now, Clemens. You will return home with me. (to the Captain) Consider this notice and warning. \nFORD You will accept a note? \nFREEMAN As always, from you, Mr. Ford. Eliza is beside herself as it seems she is about to be separated from her family. She begs of Ford: \n(CONTINUED) \n59 CONTINUED: 59 \nELIZA Please, sir... Please don't divide my family. Don't take me unless you take my children as well. \nFREEMAN Eliza, quiet! \nELIZA You will have the most faithful slave in me, sir. The most faithful slave that has ever lived, but I beg that you do not separate us. A BUYER interrupts the skirmish and approaches Freeman and delivers coolly, eyeing Randall- \nBUYER Your price for the child? \nFREEMAN You see how fit the boy is. Like ripe fruit. He will grow into a fine beast. Randall is made to run, and jump by FREEMAN - exhibiting his activity and his condition. \nFREEMAN (CONT'D) Six hundred, and that's fair and final. \nBUYER Done. He reaches into his waistcoat and retrieves his wallet, counting out six hundred dollars, placing them into the already extended hand of Freeman. Ford sees the distress and panic in Eliza; it visibly touches him. He now tries to buy EMILY to console her. \nFORD How much for the little girl? You have no need for her. One so young will bring you no profit. \nFREEMAN I will not sell the girl. There's heaps 'n piles of money to be made off her. She is a beauty. One of the regular bloods. None of your thick-lipped, bullet headed, cotton picking niggers. \n(CONTINUED) \n39A. \n59 CONTINUED: (2) 59 \nFORD Her child, man. For God's sake, are you not sentimental in the least? \nFREEMAN My sentimentality stretches the length of a coin. Do you want the lot, Mr. Ford, or do you pass on them all? \nFORD I will take the ones Platt and Eliza. Eliza grips her children tight. \nELIZA I will not go without my children. You will not take them from me. \n(CONTINUED) \n59 CONTINUED: (3) 59 As if to prove her wrong, Freeman puts a foot to Eliza and harshly kicks her away from Emily. \nELIZA (CONT'D) Please, don't. No! Freeman, to Cape: \nFREEMAN Take her out of here. Cape DROPS HIS FIDDLE, begins to pull Eliza away toward the door of the room, but her screaming and pleading do not abate. IT IS CLEARLY UNSETTLING TO THE OTHER BUYERS. \nFREEMAN (CONT'D) Keep her quiet. Cape tries to muzzle her with his hand, but Eliza continues to scream for her children as Emily does for her mother. \nEMILY Mama... Mama! \nFREEMAN \n(TO SOLOMON) Play something! Get the fiddle and play. As ordered, Solomon takes up Cape's fiddle and begins to play lightly. \nFREEMAN (CONT'D) Play! Solomon plays harder and more loudly. Still, it is barely enough to drown out Eliza's cries. Freeman gets the other slaves to clap along with Solomon's playing. Emily frees herself and runs back, crying but endeavoring to be strong- \nEMILY Don't cry, Mama. I will be a good girl. Don't cry. I will keep my head up and I will look smart. I will always look smart. \nFREEMAN Make merry, all of you! Goddamn it, Cape! Keep her quiet or it's your damned hide I will take it out of! Cape pulls a rag, stuffs it in Eliza's mouth. Clamping both hands over her mouth, he hauls Eliza from the room by the head. IT IS AN UGLY, UGLY SCENE. \n40A. \n60 EXT. FORD PLANTATION - LATER 60 \nDriven in a horse drawn wagon by Ford are Solomon and Eliza. Eliza is sullen to say the least. With the loss of her two children she has dropped into a depression she will not be able to pull out of. \n(CONTINUED) \n60 CONTINUED: 60 They arrive to the FORD PLANTATION. The main house of the plantation - the GREAT HOUSE as they are commonly called - is sizable. Two stories high with a piazza in front. In the rear are also a log kitchen, poultry house, corncribs and several slave cabins. The plantation is described as \"a green spot in the wilderness.\" With the arrival of Master Ford there is a flurry of activity - the \"excitement\" of a new delivery. MR. CHAPIN, a white overseer, instructs a slave named SAM. \nCHAPIN Sam, call to the Mistress. \nSAM Mistress! Mistress, they arrivn'. MISTRESS FORD EXITS the house - along with her attending slave, RACHEL, who is a cook AS WELL AS SAM'S WIFE - and travels to her husband, kisses him, then laughingly \n65 CONTINUED: 65 the lawn just beyond the piazza. Mistress Ford is present as well. As the slaves listen, Ford reads to them Scripture. His tone is of a man trying to preach by way of compassion. \nFORD \"But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine. Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\" Despite the lightness with which Ford speaks and the hope in his words, ELIZA SITS OFF TO THE SIDE - SELF-SECLUDED \nA BIT - WEEPING GENTLY. We should be able to see in Mistress Ford's eyes that Eliza's constant crying is unsettling. \nOMITTED \n67 OMIT 67 \n68 OMITTED 68 \n69 OMIT 69 \n70 EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA - DAY 70 \n-MID JUNE, 1841- The slaves have broken for lunch. They snack on smoked meat and drink water from gourds. As they lunch Solomon reads from Sam's Bible to the other slaves. \nSOLOMON But he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? Is not he that sitteth at meat? But I am among you as he that serveth. A white customer - WINSLOW - irate at the sight and sound of slaves reading Scripture, crosses over. He grabs the Bible. \nWINSLOW From where did you thieve this? \nSAM Suh, the book is my property. The White Customer has no interest in Sam's answer. With flailing hands he STARTS BEATING ON SAM. Solomon tries to stop him. That only makes the situation worse, Solomon now the target of the man's ire. \nWINSLOW Take your hands from me! Ford comes running over. \nFORD What is the commotion? \nWINSLOW Your niggers are either brazen or rebellious. This one was readin' Scripture, and this one claims it to be his. \nFORD It is. A gift from his Mistress. \nWINSLOW You condone this? \nFORD I encourage it. As a Christian I can do no less. \n(CONTINUED) \n70 CONTINUED: 70 \nWINSLOW You can do no worse, Ford. A slave that reads is dangerous. Winslow moves off. He yells back at Ford: \nWINSLOW (CONT'D) And the man who would allow a slave to read is unfit to own niggers! Handing the Bible back to Sam, very matter of factly: \nFORD Pay him no mind. The word of God applies to all. In that you may take comfort. \nOMITTED \n72 EXT. ROAD - DAY 72 \nSam is at the reigns of the wagon carrying the timber to Ford's WORK AREA. Slaves trudge alongside, same as it ever was. Only...it's not quite the same. Sam brings the wagon to a halt. He, and the slaves look up the road ahead of them. Standing in the middle of the road is a group of CHICKASAWS INDIANS. They are in their \"usual\" dress of buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic colors, buttoned from belt to chin. They have with them DOGS and HORSES. They carry with them the carcass of a deer. The two groups stare at each other for a long moment. \nEXT. FIELD - DUSK/END OF DAY \nThe groups of slaves and Chickasaws are now intermingled. They \"break bread\" - actually they work on the carcass of the deer which is now roasting over a large fire. As well the group share a smoke on a pipe. One of the Chickasaws is playing a tune on an \"INDIAN FIDDLE.\" The Chickasaws perform a customary dance; trotting after each other, and giving utterance to a guttural, sing-song noise. The slaves enjoy the respite from work, Solomon particularly taken by the music...if not entirely enthralled by it. \n(CONTINUED) \n73 CONTINUED: 73 After a bit, Solomon rights himself and heads from the group. \n74 EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS 74 \nSolomon arrives to some tall grass at the edge of the river. Lowering his trousers, SOLOMON SQUATS TO DEFECATE. As he does, he stares out toward the flowing waters of Indian Creek. After a few moments, as though a thought far greater than relieving himself has come to him, Solomon stands and replaces his pants. Oddly, Solomon stares out at the water as though he were a man possessed. \nEXT. FORD'S WORK AREA - DAY \nJust beyond the WORK AREA Solomon speaks with Ford as Tibeats listens. Solomon is drawing in the dirt, making rough diagrams for Ford as he explains himself. \nSOLOMON The creek is plenty deep enough to sail, even with a boat full of load. The distance from the WORK AREA to the point on the latter bayou is several miles by water fewer than land. It occurs to me that the expense of the transportation would be materially \nDIMINISHED-- \nTIBEATS \"Materially diminished?\" \nSOLOMON If we use the waterway. \nELIZA You luxuriate in his favor. \nSOLOMON I survive. I will not fall into despair. Woeful and crushed; melancholy is the yolk I see most. I will offer up my talents to Master Ford. I will keep myself hearty until freedom is opportune. \nELIZA Ford is your opportunity. Do you think he does not know that you are more than you suggest? But he does nothing for you. Nothing. You are no better than prized livestock. Call for him. Call, tell him of your previous circumstances and see what it earns you...Solomon. Eliza uses Solomon's name quite pointedly as if to underscore his true self. Solomon get her meaning. Yet he says nothing. Again, pointedly: \nELIZA (CONT'D) So, you've settled into your role as Platt, then? \nSOLOMON \n(DEFENSIVE) My back is thick with scars from \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n79 CONTINUED: (2) 79 \nSOLOMON (CONT'D) protesting my freedom. Do not \nACCUSE ME-- \nELIZA I accuse you of nothing. I cannot accuse. I too have done so many, many dishonorable things to survive. And for all of them I have ended up here... No better than if I had stood up for myself. Father, Lord and Savior forgive me... Forgive me. Oh, Solomon, let me weep for my children. \nFORD (V.O.) At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? \nEXT. FORD PLANTATION - MORNING \n-AUGUST, 1841- It's Sunday. The slaves are again gathered in the rose garden near the front of the house to hear the word of the Lord as read by Master Ford. \nFORD And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. The phrase seems to trigger Eliza's tears. She begins to sob uncontrollably. Mrs. Ford turns to Rachel in a hushed whisper- \nMRS. FORD I cannot have that kind of depression about. Solomon, pretending not to have heard, slowly turns to Eliza with worry. Ford continues to preach over Eliza's keening. \nFORD But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe unto \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n50A. \n80 CONTINUED: 80 \nFORD (CONT'D) the world because of offences! For it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh! \nBLACK \n81 EXT. FORD PLANTATION - DAY 81 \n-JANUARY, 1842- Seasons have passed. It is winter now, and very grey out along the bayou. Ford and Tibeats - who we have seen working around the WORK AREA - stand with Solomon, Tibeats giving Solomon an inspection. Ford carries much lament. \nTIBEATS Raise yer shirt. Solomon does as instructed. Tibeats looks at Solomon's back, at the scars from lashings he bears. \nTIBEATS (CONT'D) Troublesome. \nFORD He's a good carpenter and quick- witted. \nTIBEATS I am familiar with his cleverness. \nFORD You won't find a nigger more humble. \nTIBEATS Ain't found a nigger yet I cain't humble. Tibeats heads off. Solomon, highly curious over the preceding. \nSOLOMON Sir, have I done something wrong? \nFORD Not your concern, Platt. I say with much...shame I have compiled debts. I have long preached austerity, but find myself hypocritical in that regard. You'll be in the ownership of Mr. Tibeats. You are his now. Serve him as you'd serve me. \nSOLOMON Sir. \nFORD And your faithfulness will not be forgotten. \n(CONTINUED) \n81 CONTINUED: 81 \nSOLOMON: \nSOLOMON Master Tibeats wants to whip me for using the nails you gave me. \nCHAPIN What's the matter with the nails? With a mix of shame, anger and embarrassment, Tibeats says, as if being exposed- \nTIBEATS They're...they're too large. \nCHAPIN I am overseer here. I told Platt to use them, and \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n84 CONTINUED: (3) 84 \nCHAPIN (CONT'D) I shall furnish such nails as I please. Do you understand that, Mr. Tibeats? Tibeats answer is in the grinding of his teeth and the shaking of his fist. \nTIBEATS This ain't done by half. I will have flesh, and I will have all of it. Tibeats moves off toward, and then INTO THE HOUSE. Chapin follows. A long moment, Solomon stands alone. He looks around, not sure what to do; to stay or to flee. Anxiety mounts on his features. A moment more, and Tibeats EXITS the house. He saddles his horse and rides off to beat the devil. Or, worse, to fetch him. Chapin comes running back out of the house. He is visibly excited, and when he speaks he is quite earnest. Though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off an air of impending trouble. \nCHAPIN Do not stir. Do not attempt to leave the plantation on any account whatever. But if you run there is no protecting you. \nSOLOMON \nSIR-- \nCHAPIN If you run, Platt, there is no protecting you. Rachel...! Chapin runs off to join Rachel. The two converse at a distance from Solomon, then they head off for the log kitchen. Solomon is now very much alone, and he waits for what is to come. AND WE WAIT WITH HIM. And we wait, and we continue to wait... Moment by moment, the dread of the unexpected mounts. Solomon's eyes begin to well. He has beaten a white man, and he knows that death awaits him. \nA SLIGHT PRAYER TO THE HEAVENS BEGINS TO FORM IN HIS THROAT, but he is too choked up to fully speak it. \n(CONTINUED) \n84 CONTINUED: (4) 84 Chapin has now returned to the piazza. He stands and watches, but does not move to Solomon. Solomon waits, and waits... WE HEAR THE SOUND OF DISTANT HOOFS which grow louder and louder in the manner of rolling thunder. It's Tibeats. He returns with two accomplices; RAMSAY and COOK. They carry with them large whips and a coil of rope. \nTIBEATS Tha's the one. Tha's him. Dismounting, they move with menace that is tinged with perverse pleasure and wordless malevolence. Solomon tries to fight back, but he is strong armed and tied by TIBEATS - his wrists, and then ankles bound in the same manner. In the meantime the other two have slipped a cord within Solomon's elbows, running it across his back and tying it firmly. Solomon is then dragged toward a peach tree. A lynching is in store. The naked horror of it intensely palpable. Solomon looks toward the piazza, but Chapin is now gone. Tears of fear flow down Solomon's cheeks. He is on the verge of panic; a man heading toward his own execution, he begins to struggle and fight. A rope goes around Solomon's neck, then is tossed over the branch of the tree. The trio begin to hoist Solomon. He gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the life is choked from him. With suddenness, Chapin comes from the house brandishing a pistol in each hand - Colt Paterson .36 caliber \"Holster\" pistols with 9\" barrels. Chapin moves with determination toward the lynch mob. He is sharp and matter of fact. With the guns in hand, he really doesn't need to be much more demonstrative. \nCHAPIN Gentlemen... Whoever moves that nigger another foot from where he stands is a dead man. I am overseer of this plantation seven years, and in the absence of William Ford, my duty is to protect his interests. Ford holds a mortgage on Platt of four hundred dollars. If you hang him, he loses his debt. Until that is canceled you have no claim to his life. Directing his attention to Ramsay and Cook: \n(CONTINUED) \n84 CONTINUED: (5) 84 \nCHAPIN (CONT'D) As for you two, if you have any regard for your own safety...I say, begone! Ramsay and Cook don't need to be told twice. The pistols Chapin's gripping make the situation real clear. Without further word, they mount their horses and ride away. Tibeats remains, and his anger with him. \nTIBEATS Yah got no cause. Platt is mine, and mine ta do with as I please. Yah touch my property, I will 'ave yah strung up as well. Tibeats mounts up and departs. There is a surreal moment as Chapin's not sure what to do about Solomon. He chooses to do nothing. Solomon is left dangling by the neck from the tree as Chapin calls to Sam in the \nDISTANCE: \nCHAPIN Sam! Get the mule. You must ride to Master Ford. Tell him to come here at once without a single moment's delay. Tell him they are trying to murder Platt. Hurry, boy. Bring him back if you must kill the mule to do so! \nSAM Yes, suh! Sam mounts up and rides off, the mule demonstrating much speed. \nEXT. FORD PLANATION - LATER \nHOURS HAVE PASSED. The sun is now at its apex. The sight and smell of the red rose bush is more than vivid as Solomon remains tied and dangling exactly where he was left. The scene is both tranquil and horrific. Life on the plantation continues. The OTHER SLAVES work in the field. CHILDREN make their way playfully in the yard. It should all underscore the fact that a black, hanging even partially from a tree, is nothing unusual in this time and space. \n(CONTINUED) \n85 CONTINUED: 85 Chapin walks back and forth with the pistols in his hands. Clearly he fears Tibeats returning with more and better assistance. And yet, he does nothing to alleviate Solomon's suffering. He heeds Tibeats words, and as though caught up in the middle of nothing more than a property dispute, he offers no further aid. Solomon's head lolls to one side. He looks toward the sun. The bright light flares off the leaves and branches of the tree from which Solomon hangs. The glare in Solomon's eyes offering him more pain than solace, but he cannot help but look upward. As he does, his eyes flutter between life and lifelessness... \nOMIT \n87 EXT. FORD PLANATION - LATER 87 \nSolomon continues to hang. By now he is drenched in sweat, and nearly delirious with dehydration. His lips dry and parched. He may not die from hanging, but he may very well expire before the day is over. Eventually Rachel comes over - timidly, and as though she were acting contrary to orders - and offers a drink of water from a tin cup, pouring it in Solomon's mouth for him. She then takes a small hand towel and dabs at the water which clings to his lips. Rachel then retreats, and leaves Solomon to hang. \nEXT. FORD PLANATION - EVENING \nThe sun is just now arching for the horizon. Solomon remains, as though his torture will not end. Ford, trailed by Sam, finally comes riding up. He dismounts, and moves swiftly over to Solomon. With great heartache: \nFORD Platt... My poor Platt. Ford produces a blade and cuts Solomon loose. Solomon attempts to carry himself, but he cannot. He falls to the ground and passes out. \nINT. FORD PLANATION/GREAT HOUSE - NIGHT \nAs we come into the scene, Solomon lays on a blanket on the floor. Eventually, his eyes flutter, then open. He is in the foyer of the Ford house. As he gets his bearings, he looks around the interior. THE SPACE IS HANDSOME, AND WELL DECORATED. It is sharp contrast to the bleak surroundings, shacks and dungeons Solomon has largely been accustom to during his time of slavery. It will be the \"first and last time such a sumptuous resting place was granted\" during his twelve years of bondage. \nTREACH ...Sir... \nEPPS Damned Queen. Born and bred to the field. A nigger among niggers, and God give 'er to me. A lesson in the rewards of righteous livin'. All be observant ta that. All! \n(BEAT) Now, Treach. Now speak. \nTREACH One hundred thirty eight pounds for Phebe. \nEPPS Hit one forty five yesterday. Pull her out. \nTREACH Two hundred six pounds for Wiley. \n(CONTINUED) \n92 CONTINUED: (2) 92 \nEPPS How much he pick yesterday? \nTREACH Two hundred twenty nine pounds. Wiley is pulled from the line, huddled with Solomon. \nEXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/YARD - EVENING \nIn the distance, a flogging is going on. Solomon, Phebe, and Wiley are stripped, placed in a stockade and now being given a perfunctory whipping delivered by ANOTHER \nIDENTIFIED SLAVE. \nEXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION - EVENING \nEvening, but the day is not yet done. Slaves attend their various evening chores; feeding livestock, doing laundry, cooking food. There is no respite from a slave's charge. \nINT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT \nA fire is kindled in the cabin. The slaves finally fix their own dinner of corn meal. Corn is ground in a small hand mill. The corn meal is mixed with a little water, placed in the fire and baked. When it is \"done brown\" the ashes are scraped off. Bacon is fried. As the slaves eat, Abram goes on in great length and with much emotion about General Jackson. \nUNCLE ABRAM Hold my words: General Jackson will forever be immortalized. His bravery will be handed down to the last posterity. If ever there be a stain upon \"raw militia,\" he done wiped away on the eight of January. I say da result a that day's battle is of 'mo importance to our grand nation than any occurrence 'fo or since. Great man. Great man in deed. We all need pray to Heavenly Father da General reign over us always. \nINT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT \nThe slaves are sleeping. There is a loud commotion. Epps enters, drunkenly, forcing the slaves awake. \n(CONTINUED) \n96 CONTINUED: 96 \nEPPS Get up! Get up, we dance tonight! We will not waste the evenin' with yer laziness. Get up. \nINT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT \nDespite the lateness of the hour, the slaves are up and now fully dressed. They take up position in the middle of the floor. They wait, poised like actors. Solomon strikes up a tune; Henry joins in with a pan flute and the slaves dance. They do so very wearily. The whole of it certainly more torture than pleasure. Epps, whip in hand: \nEPPS Where's yah merriment? Move yer feet. As the slaves twirl about Epps keeps an attentive eye on Patsey. It should be quite clear that his primary motivation for holding dances is so that he may view Patsey twirl about the floor. This fact is not lost on Mistress Epps. A few moments of Epps's lust on display is all that the Mistress can bear. Jealousy mounting, she snatches up a CARAFE. With all her might she throws it at Patsey. It hits Patsey square in the face. TOO THICK TO SHATTER, IT LEAVES HER BLOODY AND WRITHING ON THE FLOOR. The dancing, the music stop. The slaves, however, react as though it is not the first time they've seen as much from the Mistress. Mistress Epps, screaming like a hellion: \nMISTRESS EPPS Sell her! \nEPPS C'mon, now. Wha's this? \nMISTRESS EPPS You will sell the negress! \nEPPS You're talkin' foolish. Sell little Pats? She pick with more vigor than any other nigger! Choose another ta go. \nMISTRESS EPPS No other. Sell her! \nEPPS I will not! \n(CONTINUED) \n97 CONTINUED: 97 \nMISTRESS EPPS You will remove that black bitch from this property, 'er I'll take myself back to Cheneyville. \nEPPS Back to that hog's trough where I found you? Oh, the idleness of that yarn washes over me. Do not set yourself up against Patsey, my dear. That's a wager on which you will not profit. Calm yerself. And settle for my affection, 'cause my affection you got. Or, go. 'Cause I will rid myself of yah well before I do away with her! Mistress Epps stands irate, lost in fury and unable to even think of what to do. Eventually, optionless, she storms away. For a few beats there is only the sound of Patsey sobbing. \nEPPS (CONT'D) That damned woman! I won't have my mood spoiled. I will not. Dance! Epps sends the whip in Solomon's direction. Solomon responds by playing. Treach literally drags the prone Patsey from the floor, blood still spilling from her face. The slaves, as ordered, return to dancing. \nEXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION - MORNING \n101 INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S - LATER 101 \nA general store in the township of Holmesville. Solomon stands at the counter as BARTHOLOMEW fills Mistress Epps's order. Among the items set before Solomon is a \nQUANTITY OF FOOLSCAP. The items are collected for Solomon and placed in a sack. Solomon giving little thought to them other than getting them back to the mistress. As he turns, he glimpses the regalia of slave restraints, of all different guises; chains, muzzles for sale. \nEXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE - LATER \nSolomon returns and delivers the items to the Mistress. \nMISTRESS EPPS Any trouble? \nSOLOMON No, ma'am. No trouble. \nOMIT - MOVED TO A105 \n104 EXT. SHAW'S HOUSE - DAY 104 \n-JULY, 1844- Sitting on the Grand house's Piazza, Patsey is having tea with MISTRESS HARRIET SHAW, WHO IS A BLACK WOMAN. Though once a slave, she is now comparatively refined though not wholly so. The table where they sit is adorned with white linens, and they are attended by a HOUSE NIGGER. It makes for a tranquil surreal scene. \nMASTER SHAW, A WHITE MAN, IS ON THE LAWN GROOMING A \nHORSE. \nA105 EXT. ROAD - DAY A105 \nSolomon is running flat out along the road. Running as though his life depended on getting to his destination in beyond a timely manner. \nB105 EXT. SHAW'S HOUSE - DAY B105 \nStill running, slick with sweat, Solomon comes upon the \nSHAW HOUSE. As Solomon arrives: \nMASTER SHAW Platt Epps, good Sunday morning. \nSOLOMON Good morning, Master Shaw. I've been sent by Master to retrieve Patsey. May I approach? \nMASTER SHAW You may. Solomon makes his way over to the piazza. \nSOLOMON Excuse me, Mistress Shaw. \nMISTRESS SHAW Nigger Platt. \nSOLOMON My apologies. Patsey, Master wishes you to return. \nPATSEY Sabbath day. I's free ta roam. \nSOLOMON Understood. But the Master sent me running to fetch you, and said no time should be wasted. \nMISTRESS SHAW Drink tea? \nSOLOMON Thank you, Mistress, but I don't dare. \nMISTRESS SHAW Would you knowed Massa Epps's consternation ta be any lessened wit your timely return? Sit. Sit and drink the tea that offered. \n(CONTINUED) \nB105 CONTINUED: B105 Solomon knows better, but he sits and the Mistress has tea poured for him. \nMISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D) What'n was Epps's concern? \nSOLOMON ...I'd rather not say... \nMISTRESS SHAW L'il gossip on the Sabbath be fine. All things in moderation. Solomon is not sure what to say. He struggles to be as diplomatic as possible. \nSOLOMON As you are aware, Master Epps can be a man of a hard countenance. There are times when it is impossible to account for his logic. You know he has ill feelings toward your husband. \nMISTRESS SHAW He do. \nSOLOMON Master Epps has somehow come to believe, as incorrectly as it may be, that Master Shaw is... That he is something of a lothario and an unprincipled man. A misguided belief born out of their mutual competition as planters, no doubt. \nMISTRESS SHAW No doubt...if not born outta truth itself. The Mistress waves to Shaw. Shaw, unsuspecting of the conversation, waves back. \nSOLOMON I'm certain Patsey's well being is Master Epps's only concern. \nEPPS (CONT'D) There; there's all the truth he got. Damned nigger. Damn yah. Epps pushes his way past the Mistress. \nEXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/FIELD - DAY \n-AUGUST, 1844- With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are working the field picking cotton. As before THEY SING A SPIRITUAL, the only thing that distracts them from the tedium at hand. But there is no distracting from the heat. We see Henry begin to falter before it... And eventually collapse right in the dirt. Though the other slaves take note, none move to help him. None dare. From Treach rather matter of factly: \nTREACH Get him water. Edward runs to fetch a gourd. He carries it to Henry, \nDUMPS THE WATER ON HIM, BUT DOES NOT ACTUALLY GIVE HENRY \nANYTHING TO DRINK. Roused, Henry rights himself. \nEDWARD Go'won. Git up. Unsteadily, Henry lifts himself and goes back to picking cotton. He joins in again with the spiritual, as if the song is all that can keep him going. \nINT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACKS - NIGHT \n-OCTOBER, 1844- \n(CONTINUED) \n107 CONTINUED: 107 The slaves are asleep. Epps arrives, again without knocking, with his whip in hand. The slaves stir. Uncle \nABRAM ASKS: \nUNCLE ABRAM We dance tonight, massa? Epps remains quietly focused on Patsey. And it's clear from her apprehensive expression just what it is he's come looking for. This time there is no escaping it. As if to acknowledge the badness to come, Phebe lightly cries. \nEXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SMOKE HOUSE - NIGHT \nOn top of a wood pile, in the back of the smoke house - Epps shoves Patsey. He stops, stands as if gathering his manhood, then he's all over Patsey. He is rough and clumsy. It looks like something between an awkward rape and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter. Patsey does not respond in any way other than to continually turn her head from Epps, but otherwise remain as still as possible. If there is such a thing, she is vicious with her passive aggressiveness. Epps's frustration mounts until - as the Mistress Shaw had cautioned - he crosses the line from passion to violence. He begins slapping Patsey to get a response from her. When that fails, he punches her which only leads to him taking up his whip and lashing Patsey MERCILESSLY. Still, she gives him nothing. Beaten, Patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton, Epps deep breathing above her. The desire for sex now having left him. Epps heads from the field. Patsey is left where she is. \nINT. BARTHOLOMEW'S - DAY \n-NOVEMBER, 1844- As before, Solomon waits as Bartholomew fills Mistress Epps order. Among the items set before Solomon is another quantity of foolscap. \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nSolomon is making his way back to the Epps plantation. He carries with him a sack filled with the goods from the store. As he walks, SOLOMON LOOKS AROUND CASUALLY. When he is certain he is alone, he sets down the sack, opens it and appropriates A SINGLE SHEET OF THE PAPER which he folds and places in his pocket. That done, he cinches up the sack and continues on his way. \n111 OMIT 111 \n112 INT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - DAY 112 \nSolomon takes the slip of paper and hides it within his fiddle. Perhaps the safest place he can think of. He acts as though he's hiding away found gold. In reality it's more than that. For Solomon the paper is a first step toward freedom. \nINT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT \n-DECEMBER, 1844- It's another night of Epps's forced revelry. Coming in quick from the previous scene, we go from Solomon holding his fiddle, to playing it as the slaves are again made to dance. Mistress Epps brings out a tray of freshly baked pastries. She sets them down on a table. \nMISTRESS EPPS A moment from the dancing. Come sample what I baked for y'all. The slaves, thankful for the rest as much as the food, file toward the tray reciting a chorus of \"Thank you, Mistress.\" As Patsey moves toward the pastries: \nMISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) There'll be none for you, Patsey. Patsey merely turns away. Her non responsiveness, however, serves only to incite the Mistress. Screaming: \nMISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) Yah see that? Did yah see the look of insolence she give me? \nEPPS Seen nothin' but her turn away. \nMISTRESS EPPS Are you blind or ignorant? It was hot, hateful scorn. It filled that black face. Yah tell me yah did'n see it, then yah choose not to look, or yah sayin' I lie. \nEPPS Whatever it was, it passed. \nMISTRESS EPPS Is that how yah are with the niggers? Let every ill thought fester inside 'em. Look at 'em. \n(MORE) (CONTINUED) \n113 CONTINUED: 113 \nMISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) They foul with it; foul with their hate. You let it be, it'll come back to us in the dark a night. Yah want that? Yah want them black animals to leave us gut like pigs in our own sleep? Epps isn't sure how to respond to the inchoate berating. It's an invitation for the Mistress to continue. \nMISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) You are manless. A damned eunuch if ever there was. And if yah won't stand for me, I'd pray you'd at least be a credit to yer own kind and beat every foul thought from 'em. Epps does nothing. The Mistress lets her anger loose. She moves quickly to Patsey, DRIVES HER NAILS INTO THE \nPATSEY'S FACE AND DRAWS THEM DOWN ACROSS HER FEATURES. \nFIVE DEEP AND BLOODY GASHES ARE LEFT IN PATSEY'S SKIN, the moment marked with appropriate screams. Patsey collapses on the floor, covering her bleeding face. \nMISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) Beat it from 'em! Thoroughly cuckolded by the Mistress's actions, Epps takes his whip and pulls Patsey out of the house. His intentions are plain. All the slaves remain silent. The Mistress, however, displaying high satisfaction, entreats the others: \n130 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT 130 \n-FEBRUARY/MARCH, 1847- Alone out on the edge of the Bayou, Solomon is playing a low air on his violin WHILE SNACKING ON SCRAPS OF BACON. As he plays, something appears in the distance. From the edge of the bayou, coming forth like an apparition arisen from the earth, is CELESTE. She is a young woman of about 19 years of age and far whiter than most blacks. \n\"IT REQUIRED CLOSE INSPECTION TO DISTINGUISH IN HER FEATURE THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF AFRICAN BLOOD.\" Beyond that, she is pale and haggard, but still lovely. Dressed in a white gown, she emerges from the water. Draped on her dress, her period. A line in her skirt. It's very visible, but not shocking. A ribbon of red in her dress. Celeste moves to Solomon without fear or hesitation. As Solomon, startled, takes her in, Celeste says quite \nPLAINLY: \nCELESTE I am hungry. Give me food. \nSOLOMON Who are you? \nCELESTE I'm hungry. Solomon gives Celeste some of his food. Celeste, famished, devours it. \nSOLOMON What is your name? \nCELESTE My name is Celeste. \nSOLOMON What are your circumstances? \nCELESTE I belong ta Massa Carey, and 'ave been two days among da palmettoes. Celeste is sick and cain't work, and would rather die in the swamp \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n130 CONTINUED: 130 \nCELESTE (CONT'D) than be whipped to death by the overseer. So I took myself away. Massa's dogs won't follow me. The patrollers 'ave tried to set dem on me. But dey a secret between dem and Celeste, and dey won't mind the devilish orders of the overseer. Celeste lifts her head from the food on which she gnaws. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) Do you believe me? \nSOLOMON Yes. \nCELESTE Why? \nSOLOMON There are some whose tracks the hounds will refuse to follow. \nCELESTE Give me more food. I'm starvin'. \nSOLOMON This is all my allowance for the \nREST OF-- \nCELESTE Give it to me. Almost as if compelled, Solomon does as ordered. As she eats, Celeste aggrandizes herself: \nCELESTE (CONT'D) Most slaves escape at night. The overseers are alert for such chicanes. But Celeste tricked dem 'n alight in the middle of the day wit the sun up at its highest. The place of my concealment now deep in the swamp, not half a mile from Massa's plantation, and a world apart. A world a tall trees whose long arms make fo' a canopy so dense dey keep away even the beams of the sun. It twilight always in Celeste's world, even in the brightest day. I will live there, and I will live freely. The overseers are a cowardly lot. Dey will not go where their dogs show fear and where it always be night. Others will join me in the twilight, and we ain't gunna be slaves no 'mo forever. \n(CONTINUED) \n130 CONTINUED: (2) 130 Solomon isn't sure what to say. Before he can say \nANYTHING: \nCELESTE (CONT'D) Celeste will come to you again in the night. You will have food for her. Celeste departs the way she came; as though she were a vision. \nINT. JUDGE TURNER'S PLANTATION/FOOD STORAGE - NIGHT \nSolomon stealthfully makes his way into the storage shed. Dried and smoked meats are hung, and milled corn is about. Taking out a handkerchief, Solomon begins to load it with food. Not too much. Not so much his thievery will be readily noticed, but he does avail himself. \nEXT. TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT \nSolomon plays his violin, but plays it with an anxious nature as he waits. Then, as before, a figure appears in the distance. It is Celeste coming out of the night. She makes her way directly to Solomon. With no greeting, she says: \nCELESTE I am hungry. Solomon gives Celeste the handkerchief he's filled. She opens it, and begins to devour the food. As she eats: \nCELESTE (CONT'D) I was rude, and didn't even ask yo name. \nSOLOMON Platt. \n(BEAT) Solomon. Solomon is my true and free name. \nCELESTE Was you free? \nSOLOMON I was. I am. Solomon exposes his wrist, displays his tattoo as he \n(CONTINUED) \n138 CONTINUED: (2) 138 \nSOLOMON Go north. Make your way by night... \nCELESTE It'll only be worse if'n Celeste don't go back of her own will. \nSOLOMON You won't be caught. The dogs won't track you. You are...you are unique. Celeste... \nCELESTE You got alternatives, Solomon. \nSOLOMON To return is to die! \nCELESTE Celeste got no one to write a letter to. As if to punctuate her resolve, without a word more Celeste departs toward the swamp. Solomon starts on into the swamp after her. \nSOLOMON Celeste... Celeste! Solomon continues after Celeste, wading deeper into the dark night and murky waters. \nSOLOMON (CONT'D) Celeste, I will guide you north! Wait, and I will take you. Celeste is too nimble. She outpaces Solomon, continues on and disappears into the night. \nSOLOMON (CONT'D) Let me take you! Let me go with you! Solomon runs on, then splashes to a stop. He stumbles around disoriented, calling into the blackness: \nSOLOMON (CONT'D) Celeste... Nothing. No answer. Not a human one. There are sounds and echoes - some in the distance, some perhaps moving closer - which, moment by moment, become more and more frightening. Soon, Solomon realizes he is in quite literally over his head; the water first chest deep, then neck deep. With no way to orient himself, no means to guide him in the dark, Solomon's reserve begins to crumble. He thrashes in the water trying to find his way \n(CONTINUED) \n138 CONTINUED: (3) 138 back to shore. No longer trying to save Celeste, Solomon calls to her - desperately - for assistance. \nSOLOMON (CONT'D) Celeste! Come to me, Celeste! In that moment Solomon is quite certain he is nearly done; that he will not find land, nor aid and that this is his final moment. His panic should be that tangible. It is either force of will, or survival instinct...or maybe just pure luck that carries Solomon on until he reaches first muddy ground, then firm footing. Hauling himself onto the swamps edge, Solomon finally collapses in a drenched, worn heap. His life spared, but Celeste never to be seen again. \nBLACK \nEXT. EPPS'S PLANTATION - DAY \n-MAY/JUNE, 1847- We come up now outside of Master Epps's plantation. Epps stands in the drive. He's in surprisingly good spirits as Solomon, Uncle Abram, Henry and Bob trudge their way wearily toward Epps and his other slaves who are gathered. The cotton field is in full bloom, the crop fully returned. \nEPPS A joyous day. A joyous day. Dark times is behind us. Clean livin' 'n prayer done lifted the plague. Indicating to the cotton: \nEPPS (CONT'D) As thick 'n white as New England snow. 'N now my niggers is returned to me. \n(TO SOLOMON) Heard Judge Turner gave you favor. Oh, did you beguile him, Platt, with your slick nigger ways? Well, yah won't stand idle, boy. Not on my land. Much work to do. Days of old long since, eh? Joyous! Joyous indeed! Throughout Epps's welcome, Solomon's focus is on Patsey who is lined up with the other slaves. SHE IS NOW MORE HAGGARD THAN WHEN WE LAST SAW HER. Her face and arms display many new scars. It's clear that in the intervening years she has quite literally been a whipping boy for Epps and the Mistress. \n140 EXT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/COTTON FIELD - DAY 140 \n-JULY, 1847- The slaves are out working on the field. White hands appear, picking cotton: ARMSBY. He is wholly unskilled at picking cotton, and he puts little effort into the job. As we meet him he seems a decent sort if a little short on self-motivation. In anachronistic terminology, he'd be called a \"slacker.\" He joins in with the slaves, singing a spiritual. \nINT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/GIN HOUSE - EVENING \nAs Epps said, it is days of long since. The slaves are back to having their cotton weighed in the Gin House \nEPPS Wiley...? \nTREACH Two hundred sixty pounds. \nEPPS Bob? \nTREACH Three hundred forty pounds for Bob. \nEPPS Patsey? \nTREACH Five hundred twenty pounds. \nEPPS Tha's a girl. Don't never let me down. Platt? \nTREACH One hundred sixty pounds. Before Treach is even done announcing the weight, Epps has pulled Solomon aside to where Uncle Abram already awaits his fate. \nEPPS Armsby? \nTREACH Sixty four pounds. Epps speaks to Armsby sternly, but nothing of the manner in which he would address the slaves. \n(CONTINUED) \n141 CONTINUED: 141 \nEPPS A good days labor would average two hundred pounds. \nPATSEY Do it, Platt. Don't stop until I am dead. What else can he do? Solomon begins to whip, to truly whip Patsey. Her back welts, then tears... Patsey screams in agony. Solomon strikes again and again... After a full thirty lashes Solomon looks to Epps, who is not satisfied. \nEPPS Until I say no more! I ain't said nothing! Solomon strikes another ten to fifteen times. By now, as promised, Patsey's back has been reduced to LITTLE MORE \nTHAN TORN MEAT AND BLOOD. Finally, Solomon holds low the whip. He can and will do no more. \nEPPS (CONT'D) Strike her! Strike her! Solomon will not. Epps takes up the whip and whips Patsey with \"ten fold\" greater force than he had. The painfully loud and angry curses of Epps load the air. Patsey by now is terribly lacerated, literally flayed. The lash wet with blood which flowed down her sides and dropped upon the ground. At length Patsey ceases struggling. Her head sinks listlessly on the ground. \n(CONTINUED) \n156 CONTINUED: (5) 156 Her screams and supplications gradually decrease and die away into a low moan. It would seem that she was dying. Solomon, screaming at Epps: \nSOLOMON Thou devil! Sooner or later, somewhere in the course of eternal justice thou shalt answer for this sin! Though Epps fronts rage, there should be underlying anguish for what he has done to his beloved Pats. \nEPPS No sin! There is no sin! A man does how he pleases with his property. At the moment, Platt, I am of great pleasure. You be goddamn careful I don't come to wantin' to lightenin' my mood no further. By contrast to this horror, the field of cotton smiles in the warm sunlight. The birds chirp merrily amidst the foliage of the tress. Peace and happiness seems to reign everywhere. Everywhere else. Epps leaves Patsey to herself. He says not a word to the Mistress as he passes. The Mistress herself heads back into the house. Solomon unties Patsey, lifts her and takes her to the cabin. \nINT. CABIN - LATER \nPatsey is laid on some boards where she remains for a long time with eyes closed and groaning in agony. Phebe applies melted tallow to her wounds, and all try to assist and console her. In time Patsey opens her eyes. She looks to Solomon. She does not say a word. She just looks at him...and then her eyes close again. \nMOVED TO A155 \n159 MOVED TO B155 159 \n160 INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE/ADDITION - 160 \nEVENING \n-APRIL, 1852- Solomon and Bass are working together alone on the extension. From the amount of work that's been done on it, it should be obvious that days have now passed. Solomon makes a cautious approach to Bass. As casually as he can he inquires: \nSOLOMON Master Bass, I want to ask you what part of the country you came from? \nBASS No part of this land. I was born in Canada. Now guess where that is. \nSOLOMON Oh, I know where Canada is. I have been there myself. \nBASS Have you? \nSOLOMON Montreal and Kingston and Queenston and a great many places. And I have been in York state, too. Buffalo and Rochester and Albany, and can tell you the names of the villages on the Erie canal and the Champlain canal. Bass gives Solomon a long and curious stare. \nBASS Well traveled for a slave. How came you here? \nSOLOMON Master Bass, if justice had been done I never would have been here. \nBASS How's this? Tell me all about it. \nSOLOMON I am afraid to tell you, though I don't believe you would tell Master Epps if I should. \nBASS Every word you speak is a profound secret. \n(CONTINUED) \n160 CONTINUED: 160 Solomon holds a moment. Hasn't he heard the same promise before? Prior to Solomon stating his case, WE FADE TO: \n161 INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION / ADDITION - DAY 161 \nHours have passed. Bass reflects on the story that Epps has told in the intervening. \nBASS How many years all told? \nSOLOMON Just nearly...just passed eleven. \nBASS Your story is...it is amazing, and in no good way. \nSOLOMON Do you believe, sir, in justice as you have said? \nBASS I do. \nSOLOMON That slavery is an evil that should befall none? \nBASS I believe so. \nSOLOMON If you truly do, I would ask...I would beg that you write my friends in the north, acquainting them with my situation and beseeching them to forward free papers, or take such steps as they might consider proper to secure my release. Bass looks at Solomon, holding his gaze for more than a prolonged beat. \nSOLOMON (CONT'D) My daughter Margaret is possibly now 19 and my son Alonzo, 16. I miss them so. It would be an unspeakable happiness to clasp my wife and my family again. Bass hands Solomon an end of a long plank of wood and looks over his shoulder, as if to camouflage the conversation by work. They both lift it toward the floorboards. Finally Bass speaks. \nSOLOMON ...Sir... The Sheriff crosses to him. \nSHERIFF Your name is Platt, is it? \nSOLOMON Yes, sir. Pointing off to the distance. \nSHERIFF Do you know that man? \n(CONTINUED) \n118A. \n168 CONTINUED: 168 Solomon looks toward the carriage. He has to shield his eyes from the sun. Recognition is slow coming to him. But when it does, it hits him as a rush. \nSOLOMON Mr. Parker...? \n(CONTINUED) \n168 CONTINUED: (2) 168 Solomon starts for Parker, but he is pulled back by the Sheriff who is keen to determine Solomon's true identity. \nSHERIFF Say again? \nSOLOMON Mr. Parker? As he does, Epps makes his way over. \nSHERIFF That man received a letter compiling many accusations. You look me in the eye and on your life answer me truthfully: have you any other name than Platt? \nSOLOMON Solomon Northup is my name. \nEPPS Sheriff... \nSHERIFF Have you a family? \nEPPS What's all this? \nSHERIFF It's official business. \nEPPS My nigger, my business. \nSHERIFF Your business waits. \n(TO SOLOMON) Tell me of your family. \nSOLOMON I have a wife and two children. \nSHERIFF What were your children's names? \nSOLOMON Margaret and Alonzo. \nSHERIFF And your wife's name before her marriage? \nSOLOMON Anne Hampton. I am who I say. Solomon pushes past the sheriff. As Solomon moves toward Parker, his pace quickens with each step until his \n(CONTINUED) \n119A. \n168 CONTINUED: (3) 168 personal velocity has him nearly at a dead run. The two old friends make contact with each other, wrap each other in a long and emotional embrace. It if finally broken by Epps, who has moved over with the Sheriff. \n(CONTINUED) \n168 CONTINUED: (4) 168 \nEPPS Nah... You will unhand 'em. Platt is my nigger! \nPARKER He is Solomon Northup. \nEPPS You say... \nPARKER He belongs to no man. \nEPPS You say! You come here, unfamiliar to me, and make claims. \nSHERIFF Not claims. I have no doubts. This is Solomon Northup, a resident of Saratoga Springs, NY. \nEPPS To hell with that! My nigger, and I'll fight you for 'em! \n", "test1_input": "EPPS (CONT'D) Damn you! Damn you all! Damn you! \nRE-OMIT \n117 EXT. JUDGE TURNER'S PLANTATION - EVENING 117 \n-OCTOBER, 1846- Henry, Bob, Uncle Abram and Solomon sit in the back of a cart. SOLOMON HAS HIS FIDDLE WITH HIM. Epps has delivered the men to JUDGE TURNER, a distinguished man and extensive planter whose large estate is situated on Bayou Salle within a few miles of the gulf. Epps and Turner stand off to one side engaged in bargaining as Henry, Bob, Uncle Abram and Solomon wait and watch. One of the slaves whisper under their breath. \nEPPS' SLAVE I hear cutting cane is twice as hard as picking cotton. \nBOB But at least we'll be away from Master Epps. \nUNCLE ABRAM Boy, you two have no sense. Epps returns to his slaves and gives a parting salutation. \nEPPS Yer Judge Turner's for the season. More if need be, until my crop return. Yah'll bring no disrespect to me, and yah'll bring no biblical plagues to him. Be decent, ere mark my words, I will deliver an ungodly whippin'. \nINT. SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT \n(CONTINUED) \n118 CONTINUED: 118 Slaves are crammed into the shack - LITERALLY ON TOP OF EACH OTHER - as they try to sleep. Some lay, some sit up. Packed in like cattle, there is barely room to move let alone draw a deep, clean breath. There is a real risk of suffocating in the mass. Some cough and wheeze. \nA CHILD CRIES... Among them is Solomon who must believe at this point that his life has reached its very lowest point. The odds of survival are slight, let alone the chance of actually ever returning to his family. This clearly weighs on him as he struggles to find anything like comfortable space in the pen. \nEXT. CANE FIELDS - DAY \nAn OVERSEER is explaining to the new slaves - SOLOMON AMONG THEM - how to cultivate cane. WITH A KNIFE IN HAND he demonstrates the process: \nOVERSEER Draw the cane from the rick, cut the top and flags from the stalk, understand? Leave only that part which is sound and healthy. Cast off the rest... \nEXT. CANE FIELDS - DAY \n-NOVEMBER, 1846- ABOUT THIRTY SLAVES are working the field. They are divided into THREE GANGS. The first which draw the cane, the next lay the cane in the drill, the last then hoe the rows after. Solomon is among a gang that draws and cuts, and he moves with speed and skill. Certainly more so than he displayed picking cotton. Standing with his overseer, Judge Turner watches. \nINT. SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT \nAgain, the slaves have been herded into the shack and pressed together. As he tries to rest - sleep is nearly impossible - Solomon finds himself face to face with a woman, ANNA. She is awake. For a few beats she avoids eye contact with Solomon. She seems, like Solomon, to be unaccustomed to her surroundings and horribly frightened by them. Eventually her eyes meet Solomon's. She makes no sound, but great apprehension spills from her eyes. Whatever's next, whatever horror awaits, she can barely stand to face. Fear, proximity... They drive her hand \n(CONTINUED) \n81A. \n121 CONTINUED: 121 to Solomon's. After a moment of seemingly reacquainting herself with genuine human contact, the woman TAKES \n(CONTINUED) \n121 CONTINUED: (2) 121 SOLOMON'S HAND AND PRESSES IT TO HER BREAST. Solomon tries to jerk his hand away, but ANNA HOLDS IT IN PLACE. Manipulating Solomon's hand, she begins to massage her breast. Solomon takes no real pleasure in the act - really, neither does Anna. THERE SHOULD BE A TRUE SENSE \nANNA IS JUST SO VERY, VERY DESPERATE FOR HUMAN CONTACT, \nFOR THE NEED TO FEEL ALIVE AND LIKE A PERSON RATHER THAN \nAN ANIMAL THAT EMOTIONALLY SHE IS WILLING TO ENGAGE \nSOLOMON. The need quickly compounds. Anna presses her lips to Solomon's. Eventually, SHE DIRECTS HIS HAND BENEATH HER DRESS AND BETWEEN HER LEGS. Solomon, with slightly more compassion than a guy making union wages, BEGINS TO MANIPULATE ANNA WITH HIS HAND. The act remains more perfunctory than passionate. We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual release. But more - or substantially less - than joyous sex, it is really just a drug-like inoculation against reality. But the feeling quickly fades. All that remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret. And there is shame, too. This is put on display as Anna turns away from Solomon. As quickly as it began, it is as though the act had not happened at all. \nOMIT \n123 EXT. JUDGE TURNER'S PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE - EVENING 123 \nSolomon waits outside the house on the porch. A house servant - ZACHARY - approaches and admonishes Solomon. \nZACHARY Off the porch. Get off. Like a dog shooed away, Solomon steps down. Eventually Judge Turner exits the house and crosses to Solomon. \nSOLOMON ...Sir... \nJUDGE TURNER Platt is it? Have you cultivated cane previously? \nSOLOMON No, sir, I have not. \nJUDGE TURNER You take to it quite naturally. Are you educated? \n(CONTINUED) \n123 CONTINUED: 123 \n", "test1_true": "JUDGE TURNER You play the fiddle? \nSOLOMON I do. \nJUDGE TURNER Willard Yarney, a planter up the bayou, celebrates his anniversary in a three week's time. I will hold out your name to him. What you earn is yours to keep. \nSOLOMON Sir. \nJUDGE TURNER Mind yourself, Platt. \nSOLOMON \nYes, sir. \n124 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - LATER (MOVED FROM 124) 124 \nWork over, the slaves congregate to eat. As Solomon eats, he takes note of the JUICE FROM SOME \nBERRIES ON HIS PLATE. \n125 EXT. TURNER'S PLANTATION - EVENING (MOVED FROM 125) 125 \nSolomon plays with a piece of cane, fashions it into some kind of writing tool, testing it in the mud. He then brushes over the dirt with his hand. \n126 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT (MOVED FROM 126) 126 \nSecreted away out near the edge of the bayou and sitting by a small fire, Solomon takes the slip of paper from his fiddle. It is yellowed, showing age, but still usable. Dipping the piece of cane - a quill - into the crushed berries, Solomon attempts to write a bit on the paper. The berry juice, too free-flowing, is unusable as ink. Solomon returns the paper to the fiddle. He has some scraps of food with him, which he snacks on. \nA127 A127 \nOMITTED \nA127A INT. SLAVE SHACK - DAY A127A \nWe see a sharp object scratching onto a surface. The tool moves on to form another mark. The sound is repetitive and almost unbearable. As we move out, we see the names Anne, Margaret, Alonzo. They are engraved onto the violin, in the hidden area where Solomon would rest his chin. Solomon looks at it for a moment, moving his fingertips across the engraving. His face full of loss. Sadly, he lifts his instrument under his chin and leaning his head to the side as if to play. \n127 INT. YARNEY'S HOUSE - EVENING 127 \nA party has commenced at the noble home of one MR. YARNEY. A group of REVELERS have gathered and are on the dance floor, in fancy dress. Their faces are covered with a variation of decorative masks. The party is a feast of celebration. As entertainment, SOLOMON ACCOMPANIES A GROUP OF MUSICIANS, no more than three. And as he does so, they all play with jovial liveliness. Clearly a good time is being had by all. \nEXT. ROAD - NIGHT \nHis playing done for the evening, Solomon is returning to Judge Turner's on foot. There is only the moonlight with which to light the way. As he walks, Solomon eats from a HEARTY CHUCK OF BREAD. Obviously part of his haul from the evening. Solomon again hears noises coming from the brush just up ahead of him. Solomon tears off some of the bread, kneels and holds it out before him. \nSOLOMON C'mere. C'mon, boy. \n(CONTINUED) \n128 CONTINUED: 128 This time, there is no dog. Instead, from the dark and the brush step TWO BLACK MEN. Solomon stands. He looks the men over - their clothes tatters and they themselves covered in dirt. It becomes quite clear they are not just slaves. A fact confirmed when they step menacingly toward Solomon, ONE WITH A SHIV IN HAND. At first it seems they want Solomon's food or money. Worse, THEY GO FOR HIS FIDDLE. Solomon has but a moment to brace himself before he is attacked, TAKING A CUT TO THE ARM. Solomon fights back, PICKING UP A PINE KNOT and striking his attacker over the head. That takes the fight out of him, and both men retreat back the way they came leaving Solomon be. \nA129 A129 \nEXT. TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT \nOutside of the slave shacks Solomon's wound tended by Uncle Abram. As he works on it: \nUNCLE ABRAM Runaways I would expect. The Bayou full with 'em. They nothin' 'mo dangerous than a nigger in flight. \nSOLOMON They acted out of desperation. \nUNCLE ABRAM Act outta lunacy. Heads fulla stories 'bout life up north. Yah ever been north, Platt? \nSOLOMON ...No... \nUNCLE ABRAM And never should yah be. I hope that yah never bear witness the sorry condition of the northern black. Got neither no purpose, nor direction. They jus...they jus fall about the streets in search of sustenance of both body and spirit. \nSOLOMON You know this to be so? \nUNCLE ABRAM Two of my massas tolt me. \n(CONTINUED) \nA129 CONTINUED: A129 \n129 OMIT 129 \n", "test1_id": 1392, "test2_input": "BOB I just want to say something about Uncle Abram. He was a good man and he always looked out for us since we were little. God Bless him. God love him. And God keep him. That done, they begin to cover it with dirt. It is all the more of a funeral that Abram will receive. \nOMIT \n147 OMIT 147 \nA148 EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE CEMETERY - LATER A148 \nA female voice appears out of the blackness and begins to sing solo, \"Went down to the river Jordan.\" A response of \"Oh Yeah\" quickly follows. Again the singer continues, \"where John baptized three.\" The same faces we have seen on Epps' plantation, but now filled with rapture, appear. It's as if the voices have created a new form of awakening and presence. It seems to transcend and translate in a strange way, joy. A joy which has un-yet been seen on screen. A joy which has been hidden, but a joy which is undoubtedly there. It's captivating, infectious. This should be a moving part of the film, which stirs the audience and, for a moment, relieves them of the seemingly chastising environment. The singer continues, \"Well some say John was a Baptist, some say John was a Jew, but I say John was a preacher, because the Bible says so too, preach on Johnny.\" And with that, the rest of the congregation chant \"I believe. Oh, I believe.\" \nINT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/WOODS - NIGHT \nSolomon goes to RETRIEVE THE SMALL PACKAGE FROM UNDER A ROCK AT THE BASE OF A TREE. Solomon returns the letter to hiding. He takes the money with him and cautiously moves from the area. \nOMIT \n150 INT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/ARMSBY'S SHACK - LATER 150 \nThe door opens. Solomon enters. Armsby is surprised to see him. So much so, he isn't sure what greeting to give. Solomon gives a blunt introduction. Re: the \nCOINS: \nSOLOMON The proceeds of my fiddling performances. A few picayunes, but all I have in the world. I promise them to you if you will do me the favor I require. But I beg you not to expose me if you cannot grant the request. \nARMSBY What do you ask? \nSOLOMON First, your word, sir. \nARMSBY On my honor. \nSOLOMON It is a simple enough request. I ask only that you deposit a letter in the Marksville post office. And that you keep the action an inviolable secret forever. The details of the letter are of no consequence. Even at that, there would be an imposition of much pain and suffering were it known I was the author. A patron is what I require, sir. \nARMSBY Where's the letter now? \nSOLOMON ...It is not yet written. I will have it in a day. Two at most, my skill with composition as poor as it is. Armsby considers the request. \nARMSBY I will do it. And will accept whatever payment is offered. Solomon hesitates. In the moment, he's not so sure he can wholly give himself over to trust. \n(CONTINUED) \n150 CONTINUED: 150 \nARMSBY (CONT'D) To assist you, I put my own self at risk. I will do so, but fair compensation is all I ask. Solomon hands over the money. \nARMSBY (CONT'D) Draw up your letter. We will meet again. In two days? \nSOLOMON In two days. ...Thank you. Solomon exits. \nEXT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/COTTON FIELD - DAY \nSolomon and the slaves pick cotton. Armsby is conspicuously NOT laboring in the field. As Solomon works he is watched by Epps. Watched more than he normally is. For a moment it seems it might just be a matter of perspective; Solomon's unease over his actions. But soon Epps is joined by Armsby. The two men stand and talk, their looks locked toward Solomon. Whatever it is that is occurring between them continues for a long, long moment. But Epps makes no move toward Solomon. Solomon continues with his work. \nINT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT \nThe slaves are at rest. Gripping his whip Epps enters, without so much as a knock at the door. For a moment there's curiosity; is he there for a dance, for Patsey...? Looking right to Solomon: \nEPPS Get up. Solomon does. Epps heads back out into the dark. He says nothing, but his directive is clear: Follow me. \n153 EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - CONTINUOUS 153 \nSolomon comes out into the dark. Nearly hidden in the shadows is a bitter Epps. Despite the lack of light, Epps's malevolence is quite clear. His whip attached to his hip. As he speaks, he stokes himself with swigs from a FLASK. Epps puts his arm around Solomon, as if consoling a friend, and guides him into the woods. \n(CONTINUED) \n100A. \n153 CONTINUED: 153 \nEPPS Well, boy. I understand I've got a larned nigger that writes \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n153 CONTINUED: (2) 153 \n", "test2_true": "EPPS (CONT'D) Well, Armsby tol' me today the devil was among my niggers. That I had one that needed close watchin' or he would run away. When I axed him why, he said you come over to him and waked him up in the middle of the night and wanted him to carry a letter to Marksville. What have yah got to say to that? \nSOLOMON All I have to say, master, is all that need be said. There is no truth in it. \nEPPS You say. \nSOLOMON How could I write a letter without ink or paper? There is nobody I want to write to 'cause I hain't got no friends living as I know of. That Armsby is a lying drunken fellow. You know this, just as you know that I am constant in truth. Now, master, I can see what that Armsby is after, plain enough. Didn't he want you to hire him for an overseer? A beat. \nSOLOMON (CONT'D) That's it. He wants to make you believe we're all going to run away and then he thinks you'll hire an overseer to watch us. He believes you are soft soap. He's given to such talk. I believe he's just made this story out of whole cloth, 'cause he wants to get a situation. It's all a lie, master, you may depend on't. It's all a lie. For a tense moment we are unsure which way Epps'll go. Increasingly it become apparent that, shallow minded and equally soused, Solomon has been able to fold Epps's thoughts. In a low curse that clearly states his ill intentions. \n(CONTINUED) \n153 CONTINUED: (3) 153 Revealed is a pocket knife, which all through the conversation, unknown to us the audience, was pushed up against Solomon's stomach. As Epps speaks, he closes it and taps it on Solomon's shoulder. \nEPPS I'm damned. I'll be god... Were he not free and white, Platt. Were he not free and white. Epps heads off. Solomon is left to exhale a deep breath. \nEXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/WOODS - NIGHT \nHaving found a lonely spot, Solomon has struck a SMALL FIRE. He has in his hand his letter. With no ceremony, he casts the letter upon the flames and watches it burn. And with it, at this time, seems all chance of him ever being free. He stands and looks at it as if forever, as ashes descend into the night sky. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nA155 A155 \nEXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE - DAY \n-MARCH, 1852- The slaves are now employed working on an extension to the Great House. The slaves work under the direction of MR. SAMUEL BASS, a between forty and fifty years old, of light complexion and light hair. He is cool and self- possessed, fond of argument, but always speaking with extreme deliberation as well as a Canadian accent. \nB155 B155 \nEXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE - DAY \nAs the slaves continue to work, there is a conversation going on between Epps and Bass. Bass much skilled in the art of sophistry, while Epps's arguments are fueled mostly by emotion alone. Though at first Epps does little more than joke his way around the facts. Solomon, working still, can't help but overhear as Epps offers Bass a drink, which Bass waves away. \nEPPS Take it. You look unsettled. \nBASS I'm well. \nEPPS No shame in taking respite from the heat; drink, shade. It's ungodly for travelers. Hearty, or otherwise. \n(CONTINUED) \n102A. \nB155 CONTINUED: B155 Bass gives a laugh. \nEPPS (CONT'D) I meant no joke. \n(CONTINUED) \nB155 CONTINUED: (2) B155 \nBASS Your humor is inadvertent. Sensing perhaps Bass's laughter might be at his expense, Epps presses. \nEPPS Then share what's funny. Or what ills you. \nBASS I'm here to complete the work at hand. As requested, and as paid. \nEPPS Something rubs you wrongly. Before I take further offense, I offer you the opportunity to speak on it. \nBASS You ask plainly, I will tell you plainly. What I find amusing: You worry about my well being in the heat but, quite frankly, the condition of your laborers-- \nEPPS \"The condition of my...\" What in the hell are you-- \nBASS It is horrid. It's all wrong. All wrong, sir. \nEPPS They ain't hired help. They're my slaves. \nBASS You say that with pride. \nEPPS I say it as fact. \nBASS If the conversation concerns what is factual and what is not; there's no justice nor righteousness in slavery. I wouldn't own a slave if I was rich as Croesus, which I am not, as is perfectly well understood. More particularly among my creditors. There's another humbug: the credit system. Humbug, sir. No credit, no debt. Credit leads a man into temptation. Cash down is the only thing that will deliver him from \n(MORE) \n", "test2_id": 1393, "test3_input": "(CONTINUED) \nB155 CONTINUED: (3) B155 \nBASS (CONT'D) evil. But this question of slavery; what right have you to your niggers when you come down to the point? \nEPPS What right? I bought 'em. I paid for 'em. \nBASS Of course you did. The law says you have the right to hold a nigger, but begging the law's pardon...it lies. Is everything right because the law allows it? Suppose they'd pass a law taking away your liberty and making you a slave? \nEPPS Ha! \nBASS Suppose. \nEPPS That ain't a supposable case. \nBASS Because the law states that your liberties are undeniable? Because society deems it so? Laws change. Social systems crumble. Universal truths are constant. It is a fact, it is a plain fact that what is true and right is true and right for all. White and black alike. \nEPPS Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yah compare me to a nigger, Bass? Yah might as well ask what the difference is between a white man and a baboon. Now, I seen one of them critters in Orleans that knowed just as much as any nigger I got. Yah'd call them fellers citizens, I s'pose? \nBASS Look here; you can't laugh me down in that way. These niggers are human beings. If they are allowed to scale no higher than brute animals, you and men like you will have to answer for it. There's an \nILL-- \n(CONTINUED) \nB155 CONTINUED: (4) B155 \nEPPS Ahhh! \nBASS A fearful ill, resting on this \nNATION-- \nEPPS You betray yourself a foreigner! \nBASS That will not go unpunished forever. There will be a reckoning yet. \nEPPS You like to hear yourself talk, Bass, better than any man I know of. Yah'd argue that black was white, or white black if anybody would contradict you. A fine supposition if yah lived among Yankees in New England. But yah don't. \n(POINTED) You most assuredly do not. \nEXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION - DAY \nIt's the Sabbath. The slaves are left to themselves to do their own chores. At the moment the female slaves are washing their clothes in large cauldrons, slapping their clothes against washing boards and hanging them up to dry near to their living quarters behind the plantation. It is a sight of ritual. Missing from the field of labor is Patsey, for whom Epps hollers. \nEPPS Patsey... Patsey! A drunk Epps asks of the slaves: \nEPPS (CONT'D) Where is she? Where is Patsey? No one answers. \nEPPS (CONT'D) Talk, Damn you! \nPHEBE We know nothin' of her, Massa. \nEPPS The hell you don't! You know where she is! She run off, ain't she? She's escaped, and you miserable black dogs stand like \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n155 CONTINUED: 155 \nEPPS (CONT'D) the deef and dumb. Speak! Speak! Not a word spoken. \nEPPS (CONT'D) My best cotton picking nigger! My best. A beat. \nEPPS (CONT'D) I'd give yah all up for her. Where she gone? The slaves say nothing. There is nothing for them to say. They don't know where she is. Eventually Epps drops into true sorrow. \nEPPS (CONT'D) She gone... My Pats gone. \nEXT. EPPS'S PLANTATION - LATER \nEpps sits on the piazza looking quite forlorn. He looks up only to see PATSEY RETURNING TO THE PLANTATION. Epps steps up to greet her, with anger rather than relief. As they hear his angry voice, the slaves step around from where they are hanging their laundry to dry. Treach is near as well. \nEPPS Run off. Run off, did you? \n", "test3_true": "MASSA EPPS-- \nEPPS You miserable wench! Where you been? \nPATSEY I been nowhere. \nEPPS Lies to your misdeeds! \nPATSEY The Sabbath day, Massa. I took me a walk to commune wit da Lord. \nEPPS Bring the Lord into yer deceptions? Yah Godless... Shaw's. Comin' from Shaw's plantation weren't yah? \n(CONTINUED) \n106A. \n156 CONTINUED: 156 \nPATSEY ...No... \n(CONTINUED) \n156 CONTINUED: (2) 156 \nEPPS Yah took yerself ta pleasure Shaw. Yah gave baser passion to that unblushin' libertine! Solomon tries to intervene: \nSOLOMON \nMASTER EPPS-- \nEPPS Now yah speak? Now that yah want to add to 'er lies yah find yer tongue. Epps goes to strike Solomon, but Patsey pulls his arm back. \nPATSEY Do not strike him. I went to Massa Shaw's plantation! \nEPPS Yah admit it. \nPATSEY Freely. And you know why. Patsey takes soap from the pocket of her dress. \nPATSEY (CONT'D) I got this from Mistress Shaw. Mistress Epps won't even grant me no soap ta clean with. Stink so much I make myself gag. Five hundred pounds 'a cotton day in, day out. More than any man here. And 'fo that I will be clean; that all I ax. Dis here what I went to Shaw's 'fo. \nEPPS You lie... \nPATSEY The Lord knows that's all. \nEPPS You lie! \nPATSEY And you blind wit yer own covetousness. I don't lie, Massa. If you kill me, I'll stick ta that. \nEPPS I'll learn you to go to Shaw's. Treach, go get some line. \n(CONTINUED) \n156 CONTINUED: (3) 156 Treach runs quickly to the tool shed. In short order he returns with the rope in hand. \nEPPS (CONT'D) Strip her. Strike her bare 'n lash her to the post. Mistress Epps has now come from the Great House. She gazes on the scene with an air of heartless satisfaction. Now tied to the post, Epps stands behind Patsey with his whip. \nEPPS (CONT'D) Yah done this to yerself, Pats! Epps hoists the whip to strike, holds it high...but no matter his rage, Epps cannot bring himself to deliver the blow. He looks to Mistress Epps who now stands gloating and spurring him on. \nMISTRESS EPPS Do it! Strike the life from her. Epps again hoists the whip. It trembles in his hand ahead of the act... But he does not have it in him to deliver such a beating. Turning to Solomon, thrusting the whip at him: \nEPPS Beat her. Solomon doesn't move. Epps shoves the whip into his hand. \nEPPS (CONT'D) Give her the whip. Give it all to her! Patsey, begging to Solomon: \nPATSEY I'd rather it you, Platt. \nEPPS Strike her, or yah'll get the same! \n(CONTINUED) \n156 CONTINUED: (4) 156 Solomon takes a step back. He unfurls the whip... He begins to whip Patsey. Lash after lash, Patsey squirms before it. Epps eyes fill with tears, he is nearly too distraught to watch. But the Mistress... She is not satisfied with Solomon's half-hearted effort. \nMISTRESS EPPS He pantomimes. There ain't barely a welt on her. That's what your niggers make of yah; a fool fer the takin'. Epps's grief is replaced by fury. EPPS GRABS THE PISTOL FROM TREACH'S HOLSTER and draws down on the slaves. \nEPPS Yah will strike her. Yah will strike her until her flesh is rent and meat and blood flow equal, or I will kill every nigger in my sight! Solomon can't strike a blow, even if it means his life. But from the ground, from Patsey: \n", "test3_id": 1394}

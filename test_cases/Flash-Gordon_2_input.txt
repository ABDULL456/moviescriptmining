KLYTUS This woman will amuse you. 
ZARKOV (INTERESTED) Klytus can see the future, eh? 
MING He can foresee it -- but for a few moments only. It gives him a unique gift for survival, -- and treachery. 
ZARKOV Extraordinary. I'd like to study his beta factors -- I wager I could extend them with a course of telekinetic exercise. (peering at KLYTUS) Tell me -- when you use this fit does your temporal lobe prickle? Here? 
MING flashes a glance of interest at ZARKOV, then addresses the LEADER of the ARMORED MEN. 
MING Chain this one up. Preserve him for further examination. 
LEADER Hail, Ming! 
ZARKOV is roughly seized. FLASH starts after them angrily as they drag the scientist away. 
FLASH Oh no you don't! We came together and we're STAYING together! 
Languidly, MING indicates FLASH GORDON with a pointed finger. 
MING That one is useless to us. Remove him and kill him. 
Shock reactions. FLASH wheels back at MING as DALE steps in front of her friend. 
DALE You dirty old bastard can kill me too! 
CLOSE ANGLE - AURA 
Wetting her lips, moving sinuously to WHISPER to MING: 
AURA Don't kill him yet, Father. Give him to me! 
MING (EYEBROWS UP) What would your Prince Barin say? 
AURA I can handle Barin. 
MING Really, Aura -- your appetites are too monstrous -- even for our family. This could cause great trouble with Barin -- I must forbid it. 
AURA touches the rime of MING'S ear with her tongue as she WHISPERS AGAIN: 
AURA But you adore me, Father -- you ca refuse me nothing . Yes? 
WIDER SHOT 
As MING steps quickly away from his super-provocative daughter and indicates DALE. 
MING Take the Earth-woman to our quarters! Bathe and annoint her for our pleasure! 
A HOODED GUARD comes from shadow, moves towards DALE. 
FLASH starts around to defend her, but before he can do it DALE has made her own move. WHAM! Quick as lightning, she flattened the HOODED GUARD with a perfectly executed city- girl's kick to the balls. DALE is astonished at her own prowess. 
DALE My God -- and I thought that book was another rip-off- 
FLASH Watch out! Behind you! 
Three more HOODED GUARDS are emerging from the shadows towards DALE. 
QUICK ANGLES 
FLASH flies at them. An elbow in the mouth disposes of one. He seizes the man's mace-like club as he falls, uses it quickly to knock cold the other two. 
AURA'S eyes shine at FLASH'S prowess. Fascinated, she runs her moist tongue along the cutting edge of her teeth. 
Panting, braced, FLASH stands in front of DALE with raised mace.

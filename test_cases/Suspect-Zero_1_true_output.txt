-That TRIBESMAN, eyes rolling back, foaming the mouth, dancing around a fire in a frenzy. Then a curtain of wheat obscures him, revealing: -Fran, and Katie, giggling, crooking fingers as if inviting us. Looks like they're naked. But as we approach them, they seem to get farther away. Then that curtain of wheat that separates us from them reveals: -Charlton, extending a hand to us, warmly, congratulating us for something, a job well done, when: 
Mackelway himself is hunting through the wet wheat, gun drawn. He FIRES... Then looks to see who he's just shot. 
A body. He turns it over. 
...and is staring at himself, lying dead on the ground in the mud and pouring rain. It is a moment of shock and horror, giving way as we... 
181   FADE UP AGAIN...                                                  181 
...on O'Ryan - at a desk, sitting upright, making notes on a pad. Calm. Businesslike. His back turned to us. 
182   INT. THAT UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - LATER NIGHT                   182 
Time has passed. We don't know how much. Or maybe we're dead, or dreaming. It's hard to say... 
But there's O'Ryan, at a desk. Writing... 
Mackelway's eyes are open. His FOREHEAD has a bright red raspberry on it from smashing into that mirror. 
But the brain is functioning. It starts running through a check-list: 
I'm in the same motel room. I'm on a bed. I'm alive. There's O'Ryan. Everything hurts. No, it's just my right arm. But it is searing. 
The check-list continues: my mouth is sore, but that GAG has been removed. 
And MY ARMS ARE UNBOUND. Legs too. Maybe I am dead. 
Mackelway tries to move his hand. It takes some effort. Everything's foggy. But he puts it before his face. Turns it. Flexes it. Squeezes it. His hand... He stares at it. 
Then he notices his SHOULDER. A fat BANDAGE has been wrapped around it - covering up the source of that searing pain. Looks as though a nurse had tended to it. 
But this sure as hell isn't a hospital... 
Then, O'Ryan turns, facing us. Mackelway recoils without meaning to. 
But O'Ryan's demeanor has changed. That look of possessed malevolence - it's gone now. We can't imagine why. 
O'RYAN (softly) Stand up. 
Mackelway pauses, rewinding that one. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) It's over now. Can you stand? 
Mackelway is still bracing for torture, or at least combat. So he's a step behind. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) We really do have to go. 
O'Ryan rises, crossing toward us. Even unbound, Mackelway is expecting another onslaught... But all O'Ryan does is drop a piece of paper onto Mackelway's lap. 
It's another DRAWING: of a RANCH-HOUSE, with a windmill in the background. Crude, but just specific enough. Mackelway's still too unwound to speak... 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) This is where he'll be. With the boy. (a beat) Zero. He's coming home today. We're going to be there. 
Mackelway's starting to understand now. This was an act. An initiation. That stuns him... 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) You're ready to come with me now. You've been in the pit. Stand up. 
Mackelway eyes him - utter disbelief. 
O'Ryan smiles warmly - like a Drill Sergeant at the end of Basic: Sorry I was so hard on you but it had to be done... Can we shake on it? 
Instead, Mackelway simply EXPLODES: 
It is a blur, faster than a blur, but Mackelway rises with an animal roar, knocking O'Ryan flat on his back. 
Then Mackelway is upon him. 
All the helplessness, all the horror, the images of watching himself in that mirror, the sounds of his own uncontrollable sobbing... they ERUPT now into violence. 
It is an overwhelming force. O'Ryan can't begin to fight it off. Mackelway has one hand on O'Ryan's throat. The other hand comes down like a sledgehammer. 
One blow. Then another. The sounds coming out of Mackelway are savage, barely human. He's out of control. 
O'Ryan's eyes roll back. Mackelway now puts both hands around this fucker's throat. He's going to kill him - right here. He's going to squeeze the life from him. 
This is a Mackelway we've never met before. His eyes are wild, hateful - even as the last gasps of breath rasp their way out of O'Ryan's throat. 
Then Mackelway is distracted, for just a second. No. Less than a second... by a glimpse of that SHATTERED MIRROR - his own twisted image. 
He looks away from it, refusing to be distracted, determined to kill this guy. 
...then those eyes drift back to the mirror again. 
...and he sees his reflection: a hardened, crazed stranger. An animal. 
His hands, without warning, release their grip. 
O'Ryan gasps for air. His face has been bloodied. Mackelway rises, disgusted, removing a great weight from O'Ryan's chest. That makes breathing a little easier. 
Mackelway crosses to a tiny, cheap BATHROOM. 
183   INT. MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - CONTINUING                           183 
Mackelway enters. There's a mirror in here too. That fat BANDAGE on his shoulder stares back at him. 
He tugs at it - doesn't unravel it, just yanks it off his arm - revealing a hideous wound. 
It's a ZERO, WITH A SLASH THROUGH IT.

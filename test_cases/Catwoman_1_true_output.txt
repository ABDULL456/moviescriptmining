INT. EDNA'S HOME - KITCHEN - DAY 
A KITTEN pounces on a CAT TOY. 
PATIENCE 
-- but this time, it was like the tiger wanted to kill me... MOVE TO FIND PATIENCE, seated at Edna's kitchen table, finishing her tale. She's in tight-fitting jeans, RIPPED along the sides, a cut-off top revealing her midriff. Safety pins hold the outfit together, but it looks good on her. EDNA is pulling out teacups, a TEAKETTLE on the burner. 
EDNA 
You were afraid -- you became its prey.   The tiger shredded your clothes? 
PATIENCE 
No, I did that myself. I mean, I remember doing it, but it wasn't really -- you know -- me. God, I don't understand what's happening. 
EDNA 
I'm not sure how to put this -- it may be hard for you to accept -- but I'm something of an expert in these matters --

PATIENCE 
What matters? 
EDNA 
Vampirism, lycanthropy... feligyny. 
PATIENCE 
(lost) Um... 
EDNA 
Feles, Latin for cat. Gynos, Greek for female. I'm a professor of folklore and mythology -- that is, I used to be, until I was denied tenure. They said my work was frivolous, but it was an all-male department, and -- well, it's a long, sordid story 
PATIENCE 
Edna, please.    Can we talk about me? 
EDNA 
Oh, yes. The other night... I think you may have... had an accident. A very serious accident. Fatal. 
PATIENCE 
(as if to a child) But -- I'm not dead. 
EDNA 
Not anymore, dear. After you died, you were reborn. As a catwoman. A dramatic WHISTLE.     EDNA takes the TEAKETTLE off the stove. 
EDNA 
Mint or chamomile? 
PATIENCE is beyond speech -- what Edna just said is impossible, and yet makes sense to her. 
INT. EDNA'S HOME - OFFICE - DAY 
PAN OVER PRINT-OUTS, PAPERS, open BOOKS. A HIEROGLYPHIC of a figure half-feline, half-female in a heavy TOME.

EDNA 
The cult of catwomen dates back to Ancient Egypt, where felines were first domesticated. A SMALL CAT suddenly LEAPS INTO FRAME, staring UP AT CAMERA. EDNA, in her reading glasses, and PATIENCE are seated before the research material spread on her desk, cups of tea before them. Edna patiently removes the CAT. 
EDNA 
Excuse me, Cicero. ON PAPERS -- a DRAWING of the TEMPLE OF BAST. 
EDNA 
The temple of the Catgod, Bast. A Persian army destroyed it in the fifth century BC. EDNA's tone is sad, as if this memory were fresh and painful. 
EDNA 
Legend has it that the priestesses became the first catwomen. The cats they'd worshipped -- Midnight's ancestors -- each gave up one of its nine lives to bring them back from the dead. ON A BOOK, images of MEDIEVAL WITCHES with their cats. 
EDNA 
In the middle ages, cats and catwomen were regarded as evil. Nonsense, of course, witches were just single, independent women who broke society's rules. EDNA passes Patience -- A BLACK AND WHITE print-out of a blurry SURVEILLANCE SHOT of SELENA KYLE, as seen in "Batman Returns." 
EDNA 
There were reports of a catwoman a while back on the East Coast -- like many, she turned to a life of crime -- but apparently she's disappeared or died.

PATIENCE studies the photo.

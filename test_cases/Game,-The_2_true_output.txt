13.  I N T .   L E O ' S  -  D A Y 
A working class bar, an ALCOHOLIC or two, pinball machines. SCHUYLER sits a table near a window, checking his watch, it's not his kind of place.  A WAITRESS arrives in a too-small uniform-- young, multiple earrings, CHRISTINE according to her name tag. 
CHRISTINE Can I take your order? 
SCHUYLER I haven't seen the menu. 
CHRISTINE Oh, right.  Here, see ya. 
She hands him a menu and starts off.  Schuyler calls after her. 
SCHUYLER An iced tea, please-- 
She waves a hand, "yeah, right," without looking back.  Schuyler sighs and opens the menu.  Suddenly, someone BACKHANDS the side of his skull, he assumes a defensive posture.  Schuyler sees his LAUGHING brother:  DAVID VAN ORTON. 
DAVID Yo, Sky.  Happy birthday. 
SCHUYLER (rubs his head, annoyed) Thanks, "Pee-pee."  I never get tired of that. 
DAVID slides into the seat opposite him.  He's in his early 30's, good-looking but unkempt, wears bright, funky clothes, an earring and a perpetual grin.  There's an intense, edgy quality to him which Schuyler has some trouble readjusting to. 
SCHUYLER Well... long time. 
DAVID Yeah, since Mom died-- what, five years? So how you been? 
SCHUYLER Business as usual... 
DAVID How's Elizabeth?  Any kids? 
SCHUYLER A little girl. 
DAVID Congrat-- 
SCHUYLER It's not mine, she married a pediatrician in Sausalito. 
DAVID You're divorced... (off Schuyler's nod) Too bad, she was actually interesting. 
SCHUYLER She stopped drinking, I guess getting rid of me was the 13th step. 
DAVID So you're all alone in the House of Pain. 
SCHUYLER I redecorated.  Where have you been? 
DAVID All over.  Nowhere in particular. Didn't your fucking gumshoes keep you informed of my every movement? 
SCHUYLER I called them off two years ago, David.  You'd kicked the heroin, you'd left the ashram, you were windsurfing somewhere in Central America... 
DAVID It's gorgeous down there... you should go sometime. 
SCHUYLER Look, are you in trouble, is there anything you need?  You can't have gone through the trust fund... 
DAVID (looks at him, hurt) That's not why I'm here, Sky, I just wanted to see you... I even brought a gift, for a change. 
SCHUYLER You didn't bake me a cake, did you? 
DAVID You can't still be mad about the hash brownies... 
Schuyler's unamused by the memory.  David grins and pulls a small envelope out of his pocket, tosses it on the table in front of him. 
DAVID Happy birthday, bro. 
SCHUYLER What is this. 
DAVID It's a bomb.  Open it! 
Schuyler shrugs, opens the envelope and shakes out-- 
A BUSINESS CARD in BLUE and ORANGE:  "CONSUMER RECREATION SERVICES." The C, R and S are HIGHLIGHTED, a PHONE NUMBER at the bottom. 
SCHUYLER picks up the card, fingers it. 
SCHUYLER Consumer Recreation Services.  OK... 
DAVID I can't tell you very much about it, that'd ruin the surprise.  Just promise me you'll give 'em a call. 
SCHUYLER I don't get it. 
DAVID Just call 'em.  OK look, it's simple, really.  They entertain you. 
SCHUYLER Is this an escort service? 
DAVID No, it's nothing like that. They're a business, they're for real... They guarantee just one thing-- you won't be bored. 
Schuyler gives him a bored, blank look.  David throws up his hands. 
DAVID They make your life fun. 
SCHUYLER Fun. 
DAVID You've heard of it. 
Christine the waitress has shown up with Schuyler's iced tea.  She puts it down hastily, spilling some across the table.  Schuyler shies away, grabbing a napkin and blotting it up before it can drip into his lap.  Cracking gum: 
CHRISTINE Sorry.

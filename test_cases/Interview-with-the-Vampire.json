{"train": "Interview with the Vampire \nInterview with the Vampire \nScreenplay by\t\t\tAnne Rice \nProduced by\t\t\tStephen Woolley David Geffen \nDirected by\t\t\tNeil Jordan \nCast List: \nTom Cruise\t\t\tLestat de Lioncourt Brad Pitt\t\t\tLouis Pointe du Lac Antonio Banderas\t\tArmand Stephen Rea\t\t\tSantiago Christian Slater\t\tDaniel Malloy Kirsten Dunst\t\t\tClaudia \nFADE IN: \nINT. ROOM - NIGHT (SAN FRANCISCO) \nA small bare room, illuminated only by the streetlight coming through the window. \nA hand presses a cassette into a recorder and fiddles with a small microphone. \nMalloy sits over a table fiddling with the tape. He is young, half-shaven, dressed in T-shirt and jeans. He looks too - \nLOUIS, who stands by the window, looking out on the street, with his back to Malloy. Louis is dressed in an old-fashioned suit. \nLOUIS So you want me to tell you the story of my life... \nMALLOY That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who - \nLOUIS (quietly interrupting) You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life. \nMALLOY So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes. \nLOUIS You followed me here, didn't you? \nMALLOY Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live? \nLOUIS It's just a room... \nMALLOY So shall we begin? (playfully, almost teasing) What do you do? \nLOUIS I'm a vampire. \nMalloy laughs. \nMALLOY See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it? \nLOUIS Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak. \nMALLOY Well, what a lucky break for me. \nLOUIS Perhaps lucky for both of us. \nStill in shadow he turns from the window and approaches the table. \nLOUIS I'll tell you my story. All of it. I'd like to do that very much. \nMalloy is uneasy as he studies the shadowy figure, fascinated but afraid. \nMALLOY You were going to kill me? Drink my blood? \nLOUIS Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change. \nLouis stands opposite, hand on the chair. Malloy is riveted. \nMALLOY You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think... \nLOUIS We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light. \nMALLOY But I thought vampires didn't like the light. \nLOUIS We love it. I only wanted to prepare you. \nLouis pulls the chord of the overhead naked light bulb. \nLOUIS' FACE \nAppears inhumanly white, eyes glittering. Inhuman or not alive. the effect is subtle, beautiful and ghastly. \nMALLOY Good God! \nHe struggles to suppress fear and understand. \nLOUIS Don't be frightened. I want this opportunity. \nLOUIS Yes... \nLestat floats down on top of him, then lifts him in the air, draws his head back by the hair and sinks his teeth in his neck. \nON LOUIS' FACE \nEvery muscle rigid, teeth clenched, as the blood is drained from him. \nON THEIR FEET \nHovering above the ground, like two quivering dancers. \nTHE WIND billows through the ghostly white sails and rigging of the boats around the wharf. \nLESTAT \nFloats higher, with Louis in his arms, draining his blood. One hand reaches out and grips a rope, hanging from a shipmast. The other holds Louis. He withdraws his teeth, and looks into Louis' drained face. \nLESTAT You still want death? Or have you tasted it enough? \nLouis can barely get the words out. \nLOUIS Enough... \nLestat smiles and lets him go. Louis falls and plummets into the water below. \nLOUIS' FACE \nComing to the surface, in the water lapping by the wharf. The bodies of the whore and thief float beside him. He looks up and sees Lestat way above him, dangling from the rope of the shipmast. \nINT. ROOM - SAN FRANCISCO \nON MALLOY'S FACE \nCaptivated, terrified, enthralled. \nMALLOY That's how it happened? \nLOUIS No. The Gift of Darkness requires more than that, as you'll see. \nEXT. WATERFRONT - DAY \nLouis floating by mudflats, surrounded by dead fish, the carcasses of animals, eighteenth century rubbish. He gets to his feet and walks weakly through the mudflats. The sun is coming up over the sea behind him. \nLOUIS (V.O.) He left me half dead that morning. he wanted something from me. He came back the following night. \nINT. LAVISH FRENCH-FURNISHED BEDROOM AT POINT DU LAC \nLouis is delirious in a four-poster bed, shrouded with mosquito netting. A female slave, YVETTE, bathes his face with a rag. She is crying. Other slave women hover in the shadows. Yvette puts out all candles save one by the bed, and withdraws, with the others. \nCandlelight flickers on the face of the bisque virgin. \nLouis tosses and turns, dreaming, murmuring incoherently. Then he opens his eyes. \nLESTAT, exquisitely dressed in French clothing, stands by the bed smiling. In the light of the candle we see that he is not human; skin too white; eyes too bright. Lestat looks amiable, even mischievous, but impossible - and angel or monster. \nLouis grabs his pistol from the table and cocks it. \nLOUIS Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house? \nLESTAT And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it? \nLouis takes aim. Lestat puts his hand over the barrel. Louis fires. The bullet tears a hole in Lestat's hand. Lestat is unfazed. He takes the gun from Louis' hand and throws it away. His hand begins to heal. \nLESTAT You're not afraid of anything, are you? \nLOUIS Why should I be? \nLouis reaches for his sword, hanging by the bed, and point it. Lestat laughs indulgently. He draws closer. \nLESTAT Are you going to put that through me too? Ruin my beautiful clothes? \nHe comes closer to Louis, right up to his face, so the sword passes through his waistcoat. \nLESTAT Were all last night's promises for nothing? \nHe reaches out with his now-healed hand and plucks out the sword. \nLOUIS What do you want from me? \nLESTAT I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it? \nLestat sits down on the bed, drawing up one knee. Louis is becoming spellbound. \nLESTAT The wine has no taste. The food sickens you. There seems no reason for any of it, does there? But what if I could give it back to you? Pluck out the pain and give you another life? And it would be for all time? And sickness and death could never touch you again? \nLouis running up the steps leading to the gallery. He is crazed with guilt. He looks up and sees - \nLESTAT \nSitting collected at the head of the steps. \nLOUIS \nBacks away as Lestat rises and descends the steps so fluidly he hardly seems to move. \nLESTAT Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean. \nLOUIS You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are. \nLESTAT (gently) I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you? \nLOUIS I can't go through with it, I tell you. \nLESTAT Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong. \nLOUIS But why do you want me? \nLESTAT Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive. \nLouis takes out his flask and drinks. Drunkenly, he turns and heads for a nearby swamp. \nEXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT \nLouis stops again in front of the crypt. Drinks from the flask, leans his forehead against the stone. \nLestat appears beside him, radiant, beautiful. \nLESTAT You really want to be with them? \nLOUIS Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised - \nLESTAT You asked for death. I didn't promise it - \nIn a quiet rage, Lestat raise his fist and shatters the marble face stone, revealing a coffin below. His fist shatters that in turn, revealing the half-rotted body of a women, holding an infant, no longer recognizable as individuals, a tangle of gruesome rotted hair, flesh, eaten away lace, insects and worms crawling over it. \nLouis gasps. \nLESTAT It's not your wife and child my friend. It's death. Just that simple. Think and choose. It happens to everyone. Except us. \nLestat stares at him, smiling, becoming a hazy dreamlike vision, then hyperclear. Louis again is spellbound. He drops the flask, which shatters on the stones. \nLestat appears angelic in his radiance. \nLESTAT We shall be this way always, my friend. Young as we are now. I'm lonely for a companion, lonely for your strength. But I'm not that lonely. Do you want to come or not? \nLouis capitulates in one long sigh. \nLOUIS Yes... \nLestat comes closer, smiling. \nLESTAT Did I hear a yes? \nLOUIS Yes... \nLestat embraces Louis, obscuring his face. He drinks his blood. We hear two heartbeats, out of sync, coming together. We see Louis' face, growing paler, paler, as his blood is drained. His eyes stare upwards, losing their focus. \nLOUIS' POV \nThe moon, through hanging vines. The marble statue of his wife and child smile at him, as if come alive. Her hair blows in the breeze, wonderful gold tresses, the child's fingers reach out... \nBACK TO SCENE \nLestat lets Louis fall down beside the broken crypt. Louis looks from the rotting bodies to Lestat above him. radiant. Lestat speaks gently. \nLESTAT I've drained you to the point of death. If you drink from me you live for ever. If I leave you here you die. \nLestat lifts his hand to his lips and blows Louis a kiss. \nLOUIS No. Don't leave me here. Give it to me. \nLestat lifts his own right wrist to his teeth. Fangs slash his own flesh, blood falls. \nLESTAT You're sure? \nLOUIS Sure... \nLouis rises to accept the first drops with his open mouth. Lestat gathers him up, as Louis clamps his hand on Lestat's arm and drinks from the wrist. \nThe VAMPIRE THEME swells. \nMALLOY The story about stakes through the heart? \nLOUIS The same. As you would say today... Bull shit. \nMALLOY What about coffins? \nLOUIS Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity... \nEXT. MANSION - NIGHT \nLouis walks up the steps to the mansion. He looks now like a fully-fledged vampire. Yvette, the slave girl stares at him from the open doorway. Cascades of harpsichord music come from the interior. \nLOUIS (V.O.) Killing is no ordinary act. It is the experience of another's life for certain. That night I had lost my own life and taken another's. I was drowning in a sea of human guilt and regret, with all the heightened senses of a vampire... \nLouis enters the mansion, following the harpsichord music, as if in a dream. Yvette draws back as he approaches. \nINT. MANSION - NIGHT \nLouis wanders into the parlor, where Lestat is playing the harpsichord rapidly and exuberantly. Louis goes to a full-length mirror and sees his own reflection there - quite the perfect vampire. \nLESTAT Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven. \nLOUIS It can't be... \nLESTAT Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching. \nEXT. POINTE DU LAC \nDawn spreading over the plantation. \nINT. BASEMENT - POINTE DU LAC \nA brick walled storage room. Two coffins stand on the floor. Lestat enters with a lantern, Louis behind. Lestat is apprehensive and protective of Louis. He pulls back one lid ot reveal a satin interior. \nLESTAT You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes. \nLOUIS And if I don't? \nLESTAT The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too. \nLouis approaches the coffin, hands trembling as he peers into it. \nLESTAT Don't be afraid. In moments you'll be sleeping as soundly as you ever slept. And when you awake I'll be waiting for you, and so will all the world. \nLouis crawls into the coffin, fearful yet fascinated. \nLOUIS You told me something earlier. You said you didn't have a choice. Was that true? \nLestat smiles bitterly and nods. \nLESTAT Someday I'll tell you. We have a lot of time to talk to each other. You might say... we have all the time we shall ever need. \nHe closes the lid. \nTotal darkness. Sounds of Louis' panicked breathing. Of his prayer again. \nLOUIS Dear God, what have I done? \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nLouis and Lestat sitting at a sumptuous table, piled with uneaten food. Lestat is going through sheafs of documents. \nLOUIS (V.O.) I awoke the next evening to a different world. And I realized there are as profound differences between vampires as between human beings... \nLestat, totting up figures on a piece of paper. \nLESTAT Your wealth, dear Louis, is inestimable. Your income from cotton alone will keep us in comfort for a century. \nLouis just stares at him. \nLOUIS (V.O.) I sat there staring at him with contempt. He had the soul of a shopkeeper, he was the sow's ear out of which nothing fine could be made. I felt sadly cheated in having him as a teacher... \nLestat looks up at him and grins. \nLESTAT You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly. \nLOUIS Do you think so? \nYvette enters, stands behind him, staring at Lestat with loathing. \nYVETTE You are not hungry, sir... \nLESTAT Au contraire, my dear. He could eat a horse... \nLestat laughs loudly. Louis turns and looks at Yvette. Her beautiful forehead in the candlelight, the veins pulsing on her neck and her hands. \nThey walk down the crowded night street, full of ladies in their finery, freed slaves, whores, sailors etc. \nLOUIS (V.O.) Lestat killed two, sometimes three a night. A fresh young girl, that was his favorite for the first of the evening. \nINT. FRENCH QUARTER MANSION - BALLROOM \nSmall orchestra plays for colonial couples in fine wig and garb prancing to a French minuet. Young women sit in chairs along the walls with their chaperones. Young men stand opposite. \nLOUIS (V.O.) But the triumphant kill of Lestat was a young man. They represented the greatest loss to Lestat because they stood on the threshold of the maximum possibility of life. \nA youth of preternatural beauty, silhouetted against French windows. He is talking to an elegant widow, seated, holding two manicured poodles. Lestat stares at the youth with longing. \nLESTAT The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead. \nLOUIS But how do you know? \nLESTAT Read her thoughts. \nLOUIS I can't. \nLESTAT The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along. \nHe leads Louis closer to them. \nLESTAT Take my word for it. She blamed a slave for his murder. And do you know what they did to him? \nHe smiles at the young man, who smiles in return. \nLESTAT The evildoers are easier. And they taste better... \nEXT. LAWNS - NIGHT \nLestat walks the youth towards a copse of trees. He looks back at Louis, who holds both poodles on a delicate leash, walking with the widow. The minuet spills from the french windows. \nWIDOW ST. CLAIR Now, young man, you really amaze me! I'm old enough to be your grandmother. \nShe leans towards him concquettishly. Louis, crazed with hunger, sees her as beautiful in the moonlight. He allows her lips reach his. He takes her in his arms, gently, romantically, and sinks in his teeth. She swoons. \nWIDOW ST. CLAIR Yes, that's the melody, I remember it. Oh yes... \nLouis draws his lips away. She is weak in his arms, but still alive. He can't do it. The poodles growl. He shoots out an arm and grabs one, then the other. \nEXT. TREES - NIGHT \nLestat, bending over the body of the dead youth. A scream pierces the night. \nWIDOW ST CLAIR Murder!!! Murderer!! \nEXT. LAWNS. NIGHT \nThe widow on the grass, her poodles dead beside her. Louis is trying to quiet her. \nWIDOW ST CLAIR My little papillions! My butterflies!!! He killed them!!! \nLestat comes from nowhere, claps a hand over her mouth and breaks her neck. He spits in fury at Louis. \nLESTAT You whining coward of a vampire who prowls the night killing rats and poodles. You could have finished us both! Louis throws himself on Lestat with extraordinary force, pummeling him towards the trees. \nLOUIS What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell. \nLESTAT I don't know any hell - \nLouis hurls him against tree after tree with a strength he never knew he had. \nLOUIS You want to see me kill? Watch me kill you then - \nHe drags him to the ground an throttles him. Lestat looks up at him, amazed and amused at the same time. \nLESTAT What strength, my friend, what strength. I remember why I chose you now. \nLestat squirms from his grip, seemingly effortlessly. \nLESTAT But you can't kill me, Louis. Nor I you. \nHe ruffles Louis' hair, with wry affection. \nLESTAT Feed on what you want, mon cherie. Rats, chickens, doves, goats. I'll leave you to it and watch you come round. Just remember, life without me would be even more unbearable... \nHe smiles. A sly, pleasurable secret secret smile. \nEXT. POINTE DU LAC - NIGHT \nTheir carriage draws up to the mansion as the first fingers of light spread across the sky. \nLOUIS (V.O.) Being a vampire to him meant revenge. Revenge against life- itself. Every time he took a life it was revenge. and the slaves with a wisdom that was denied their masters, began to notice... \nLOUIS No, ma cher. I need no supper. Is all well at Pointe Du Lac tonight? \nYvette draws closer. Light reveals her beauty. \nYVETTE We worry about you master. When do you ride about the fields? How long since you've been to the slave quarters? Everywhere there is death. Animals, men. Are you our master still at all? \nLouis watches her sadly. He's getting hungry. Her throat is long and slender, her breasts are gorgeous. \nLOUIS (dazed) Leave me alone now, Yvette. \nYVETTE I will not go unless you listen to me. Send away this new friend of yours. The slaves are frightened of him. They are frightened of you. \nShe comes closer, and he can hear her beating heart. She touches his hair. He takes her hand and brings it to his lips. \nLOUIS I am frightened of myself, Yvette. \nHe kisses her wrist. She suddenly gasps, sharply, withdraws her hand. She sees her wrist is red with blood. She sees the blood on his lips. She screams. \nLouis stands. \nLOUIS Hush, Yvette - \nShe screams even louder. Louis clamps his hand over her mouth. Her hand grips the table-cloth, pulls, bringing the empty glasses and crockery to the floor. \nIn horror, Louis realizes he has broken her neck. He brings her cut wrist to his lips, then drops it, revolted. He carries her body outside, grief-stricken. \nThe drumming grows louder. \nEXT. MANSION - NIGHT \nFires burning in the distance, round the slave-cabins. The slaves are gathered at the foot of the mansion steps. They see Louis come out, holding the body of Yvette. He is deranged with grief. \nLOUIS This place is cursed. Damned, do you hear me? And your master is the devil. \nHe places the body of Yvette in a rocking chair on the veranda. \nLOUIS Get out while you can. You're free men. \nThey don't move. They stare at him blankly. \nLOUIS Unlike me, you are no free men... \nHe turns behind him, and looks at the mansion, all candelabra and chandeliers lighted, all windows open. \nLOUIS Do I have to convince you? \nHe rushed up the stairs, snatches up the candelabra and sets fire to the drapes. He goes from window to window, lighting drapes, lace curtains, everything. \nSLAVES POV - MASTER \nSetting fire to the house. \nThey rush up the stairs with shouts of \"STOP HIM, HE'S MAD\". A wall of flame gushes out from the interior, blocking their way. \nINT. BURNING MANSION - NIGHT \nLouis, wandering from room to room of the burning mansion. he sees paintings of his wife consumed by the flames. He is weakening with the fumes, the heat. We can see this in his face, the texture of his skin. \nSuddenly a large french window cascades inwards and Lestat stands there, whip in hand. Behind him we can see the morning sky. \nLESTAT You fool, what have you done? \nLOUIS What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire! \nLouis stands there, weakened, then collapses onto the floor. Lestat darts forward and catches him before he drops. He runs out the shattered window, carrying him on his shoulder. \nEXT. LARGE GRAVEYARD - DAWN \nWith many crypts. Louis, unconscious, carried over Lestat's shoulder. \nINT. CRYPT \nDarkness. Louis lying on the floor of a large crypt. He slowly comes to. \nLOUIS Where are we? \nLESTAT Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough? \nLouis laughs softly. \nLOUIS We belong in hell. \nLESTAT And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that? \nINT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT \nHe walks to his coffin, puts her inside and sits on the lid. We hear muffled screaming and banging from inside. \nLOUIS Why do you do this Lestat? \nLESTAT I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah! \nHe stands up. The girl pushes the lid off, hysterical. She looks at Louis. \nGIRL It's a coffin, a coffin! Get me out! \nLESTAT Of course it's a coffin. You're dead, love. \nLouis screams at Lestat \nLOUIS Lestat - finish this - \nLESTAT You finish her - if you feel so much - \nThe girl grabs Louis and pleads. \nGIRL You won't let me die, will you? You'll save me? \nLESTAT But it's too late, love. Look at your wrist, you breast. \nHe picks her up again. He turns to Louis laughing. \nLESTAT Unless I make her one of us... \nLOUIS NO!!! \nLESTAT THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!! \nThe girl screams. Louis puts his hands to his ears. Then Lestat, in a fit of pique puts his teeth to her neck. She dies at last. \nA terrible silence descends. Lestat looks at Louis. \nLOUIS My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from... \nLESTAT In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you. \nLouis leaves without a word. \nEXT. DANK NEW ORLEANS BACK STREETS - NIGHT \nA rat scurried down a gutter, then another and another. Louis' hand grabs the rat. We see him from behind, walking down the street, gripping one, then another. \nLOUIS (V.O.) Am I damned? Am I from the devil? Is my very nature that of a devil? And all the while, as these dreaded questions caused me to neglect my thirst, my thirst grew hotter, my veins were threads of pain in my flesh, my temples throbbed. \nA smaller side street, in which every house is marked with an X. The street is crawling with rats, and Louis is following them. A man passes with a lantern. \nMAN Don't go that way Monsieur. It's the plague. Go back the way you came. \nLouis smiles bitterly at these words, repeating them to himself. \nLOUIS The way I came... \nHe walks on, following the rats. \nLOUIS (V.O.) ... and finally, when I could stand it no longer, I stood in an empty desolate street and heard the sound of a child crying. \nA house, the door slightly open, marked with an X. The sound of a child crying inside. Louis walks towards it. \nINT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nA little girl, pulling at a figure in a rocking chair. \nCLAUDIA Mama, please wake up. Mama, I'm frightened, please wake up. \nAs Louis enters, he sees the woman is dead. Her eyes are being eaten away by rats. \nLouis gasps in horror. Claudia turns. She is a radiant doll or angel as she stretches out her hand to Louis. \nCLAUDIA Monsieur, please help us. Papa's waiting for us at the ship. Please wake mama, Monsieur. \nShe runs to him. Instinctively, he gathers her in his arms. He looks down pitying on her beautiful face. \nLOUIS (V.O.) And if I am damned, why do I fell such pity for her gaunt face? Why do I wish to warm her tiny arms? Comfort her beating heart? \nShe snuggles into him, suddenly utterly secure. She tugs at his hair, brings his head down towards her. And we see Louis shiver, as his lips go to her neck. \nHer breathing becomes calm as she goes into the swoon. Gradually another sound replaces it. \nLESTAT'S LAUGHTER, GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER. \nSuddenly Louis backs away, caught red-handed, the child in his arms. He sees Lestat slapping his knee and laughing in the doorway. \nClaudia sucks on the wound, reviving, making little noises like a person waking from sleep. \nLouis rises to his feet as Claudia clutches Lestat's arm, sucking the blood fiercely. Lestat moans. \nLESTAT Stop, that's enough. No more. \nHe pulls her loose and she growls and stares at him with big clear astonished eyes. \nCLAUDIA I want more. \nLOUIS What have you done? \nLestat puts her down on the bed and sits beside her, holding his wrist, obviously in pain. \nCLAUDIA More. \nLESTAT Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again. \nStill suffering, Lestat pulls the bell-rope. \nCLOSE ON CLAUDIA \nBeing transformed. Becoming white yet robust, bright- eyed yet crazed. She shakes her beautiful curls and the dust falls from them. They are shining in the candlelight. \nLouis cannot stop looking at her. He does not notices as - \nThe MAID enters. \nMAID Ah, quelle Belle enfant! \nThe maid comes near the bed, kneels in front of Claudia. Lestat lays his hand on the maid's throat and Claudia watches keenly. \nLESTAT Gently, cherie. They are so innocent. They must not be made to suffer. \nClaudia lunges for the throbbing vein in the neck, locking on to the flowing blood. \nThe Maid is transfixed. \nClose on Louis, his anguish, his fascinated horror. \nLOUIS You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan! \nLESTAT That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops. \nHe lets the dead maid onto the floor. Claudia looks at the corpse. \nCLAUDIA I want some more. \nLESTAT It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child. \nLestat and Claudia sit on the Louis XVI settee. Claudia is a vision, a doll made out of pearl. Animated, voice crisp. \nCLAUDIA Where is Mamma? \nThe words echo in Louis' head, as he puts his hands to his ears. \nLESTAT Mamma's gone to Heaven, cherie, like that sweet lady over there. They all go to Heaven. And you did very well, cherie. Not a drop spilt. Very good! You're going to be our child now. \nLestat takes out his comb and begins to comb her hair. \nLESTAT Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy. \nLOUIS (whispers) You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan! \nLESTAT Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter? \nCLAUDIA I'm not your daughter. \nLESTAT Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy. \nClaudia runs over to him. She smiles at him. \nCLAUDIA Lou...eee... \nLouis is conflicted. He cannot leave her. He touches her cheeks, her hair. Same as his. Vampire skin and hair. He draws in his breath, shocked by her beauty, then he embraces her as a father might a daughter. He looks over her shoulder to Lestat. \nLOUIS You fiend. You monster. \nLestat smiles \nLESTAT One happy family. \nINT. ROOM - SAN FRANCISCO \nMalloy is open mouthed. \nPIANO-TEACHER The thumb girl! Mind the thumb! \nClaudia glares at him, then returns to playing, improving rapidly. \nINT. DOLL-SHOP - NIGHT \nPiano music over. Mozart, now well played. \nClaudia staring at a glass case, inside of which are an array of eighteenth century dolls. An old DOLLMAKER looks down on her. \nDOLLMAKER They are expensive, my dear. Maybe too expensive for a young girl like you... \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nClaudia walking along, clutching the doll. \nINT. DOLL-SHOP - NIGHT \nThe dollmaker lying dead, two puncture marks in his throat, his dolls scattered all around him. \nEXT. UNDERTAKER'S - NIGHT \nClaudia and Louis looking through the window at a display of coffins. Claudia point at the smallest one. \nLOUIS (V.O.) She grew, yet stayed the same. She wanted a bed of her own, yet would climb back into mine. \nINT. CLAUDIA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe child's coffin on the floor. The lid lifts. Claudia emerges, yawning, wanders through the flat into - \nLOUIS' BEDROOM \nWhere his coffin sits. She slides the lid off, and curls in beside him. \nINT. PARLOUR - NIGHT \nClaudia playing the piano, now with remarkable dexterity. The piano-teacher sits mute beside her. As she plays, he topples over and falls to the ground. We see the puncture-marks in his neck. Lestat, hearing the noise, comes in. \nLESTAT Claudia, Claudia! Didn't I tell you, never in the house! \nClaudia smiles to herself, keeps playing. \nINT. CLAUDIA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCANARIES sing in a cage, above a child's coffin. \nClaudia is writing at a secretaire. She is writing in a diary with a quill pen in an adult hand. She murmurs the date as she writes. \nCLAUDIA September 21st, one hour after sunset. The sky is still violet, the way Louis loves and as always Lestat was gone when we rose. \nShe looks up and sees Louis in the doorway, watching her. \nLOUIS How did you learn to write, Claudia? \nCLAUDIA The way I learn everything. By watching you. \nShe closes the diary. \nCLAUDIA But you never let me see you kill, Louis. \nLOUIS Lestat taught you all you need to know about that. \nCLAUDIA Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death. \nLOUIS He jests. \nCLAUDIA Why does he call you that? \nLOUIS Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book. \nShe opens it. Inside there is a beautiful pen and ink portrait of Louis. \nLOUIS Claudia! You did that? \nCLAUDIA Sit still. It's not finished - \nShe begins to fill in the sketch. \nLOUIS (V.O.) Time can pass fast for mortals when they're happy. With us it was the same. \nEXT. RUE ROYALE - NIGHT (1800'S) \nStreet lamps are oil at this period. Houses are now tall two-story Spanish style. Streets are flagstone. Passing carriages are black. \nLOUIS (V.O.) It was a very different life. And a new century was beginning. what had once been a small godforsaken French colony was growing into a great port, giving us an endless train of magnificent strangers... \nCLAUDIA Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am? \nLESTAT What you are? You would be something other than you are? \nCLAUDIA And if I cut my hair again? \nLESTAT It will grow back again! \nCLAUDIA But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I! \nLOUIS Claudia - \nShe turns on Lestat. \nCLAUDIA You made us what we are, didn't you? \nLESTAT Stop her Louis! \nCLAUDIA DID YOU DO IT TO ME???? \nShe runs at him with the scissors, scoring his face. The cut heals. She scores it again. It heals again. She stares at him in horror. \nCLAUDIA (whispering) How did you do it? \nLESTAT And why should I tell you? It's in my power. \nCLAUDIA Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!! \nLESTAT Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't. \nHe storms out. Louis goes to Claudia and picks her up in his arms. \nLOUIS (tenderly) We're immortal. You've always known that. \nCLAUDIA Tell me why... you've got to tell me... \nLouis carries her outside, onto the porch. There is an old flower-seller going by. \nLOUIS You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die. \nCLAUDIA And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up. \nShe clutches Louis desperately. \nCLAUDIA I hate him. But I cannot bear to lose you. You're the only companion I have, forever. You taught me everything I know. Please tell me Louis. Tell me how it came to be that I am this... thing... \nLouis strokes her beautiful face, her hair. \nLOUIS Come... I've something to show you... \nEXT. NEW ORLEANS STREETS - NIGHT \nLouis walking, holding Claudia as if he was about to lose her. \nLOUIS (V.O.) Though everything was changed, through the years had warped the contours of the streets, I found my way there, aware that I'd always known where it was and avoided it, not wanting to pass the doorway where I'd first heard Claudia cry. \nLouis back in the same street, outside the same house. He stands with Claudia at the window. There is a family inside, a picture of domestic tranquility. \nLOUIS I heard you crying. You were there in a room with your mother. You were hugging her for warmth, crying pitifully as you had been for days. Because your mother was dead... \nClaudia stares at him, suddenly very cold, very alert. \nLOUIS I opened the shutters... I came into the room... I felt pity for you. Pity, but something else. \nHe can't go on. Claudia's eyes are remorseless. \nCLAUDIA You... fed on me? \nLOUIS And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter. \nCLAUDIA You both did it? \nLOUIS I took your life. He gave you another one. \nClaudia speaks through indrawn breath. \nCLAUDIA And here it is. And I hate you both. \nShe runs. \nINT. ROOM SAN FRANCISCO \nMalloy and Louis. \nMALLOY But why did you tell her? \nLOUIS (bitterly) I can't. Go away from me. \nClaudia is shocked to her core. She steps back. Louis stares at the rippling waters. Gradually the movement of alligators stops. Then he hears a sound he hasn't heard in years. Soft, choking. He turns, sees Claudia sitting by a cypress tree, like a little girl for the first time in years. She is weeping copiously. \nLOUIS Claudia - You're crying - \nWe see her face, tears of blood running down it. She is heartbroken, lost. \nCLAUDIA You never talked to me like that - in all these years. \nLOUIS And you never cried - \nCLAUDIA I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died. \nLouis gathers her in his arms. \nLOUIS Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear - \nCLAUDIA Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you - \nLouis walks her towards the carriage. \nLOUIS I love you Claudia. Always. And we are free now, Claudia. No Lestat. Just the two of us, beginning the great adventure of our lives. \nHe lifts her into the carriage and drives off, leaving the silent waters of the swamp. \nINT. FLAT - NIGHT \nSturdy mulatto workmen lifting cases and trunks out of the apartment. All the furniture is covered in white sheets. Claudia dressed in a cap and hat, is playing the piano by the light of one remaining oil-lamp. \nLouis comes from her room with the cage of canaries. \nLOUIS The birds. We forgot about the birds. There's nothing for it but to let them go. \nHe opens the cage, and the canaries fly around the room. \nThere is a knocking on the door. Claudia falters. \nCLAUDIA What was that? \nLOUIS The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie - \nHe goes downstairs. Claudia plays a moment, then stops, perturbed. She goes to the window. Then sees something out there that makes her face go white. She screams. \nCLAUDIA Louis!!! \nTHE STAIRWAY \nLouis walking to the door. The knocking gets louder. \nTHE PARLOUR \nClaudia runs for the stairs, after Louis. \nTHE HALLWAY \nLouis reaches the door. The knocking gets louder. He opens the door as - \nCLAUDIA \nReaches the stairs. She screams - \nCLAUDIA Don't Louis - \nBut Louis has opened the door. Nothing there. He looks back at Claudia, puzzled, then at the door again when, swooping into his vision comes the nightmare image of - \nLESTAT \nIn filthy swamp-soaked rags, robust again, but his flesh shriveled, covered in scars, his eyes riddled, bloodshot. he roars. \nLESTAT WHERE IS SHE? WHERE IS THAT ACCURSED CHILD? \nLouis throws his body against the door, slamming it on Lestat's reaching hand. The hand withdraws, as Lestat roars. Louis bolts the door. \nLouis runs up the stairs, sweeps Claudia in his arms, watching appalled as the door shudders with the force of Lestat's body. \nIN THE PARLOUR \nLouis runs through with Claudia in his arms. \nLOUIS It can't be - \nCLAUDIA It is! Take the back stairwell - \nSuddenly Lestat crashes through the casement window, scattering blood everywhere, reefing himself on the shattered glass. He tumbles to the floor and gets unsteadily to his feet. \nRUINED CASTLE AFTER CASTLE, LOOKING INTO THE SKIES... \nLOUIS The quest for these Old World vampires filled me with bitterness. We searched village after village, ruin after ruin and I was glad when always we found nothing. For what could the damned really have to say to the damned? \nINT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO \nMalloy and Louis. \nMALLOY You found nothing? \nLOUIS Peasant rumors, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper. \nMALLOY No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula? \nLOUIS Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris... \nEXT. BOULEVARD FACADE OF GRAND HOTEL AND PARIS OPERA \nCrowds and gaslight everywhere. Carriages, horses, OPERA coming from the opera house. \nLOUIS (V.O.) I think the very name of Paris brought a rush of pleasure to me that was extraordinary. I was a Creole, after all and Paris was the mother of New Orleans, a universe whole and entire unto herself... \nEXT. 18TH CENTURE PALACES ALONG THE SEINE - NIGHT \nThe high walls of the Louvre, dark figures walking in pairs through the shadowy tulieries. \nEXT. STREET - SHOP WINDOW \nClaudia, in furtrimmed muff and bonnet, peers through the glass at a display of dolls. Each doll in there seems to resemble her, with blonde hair and blue eyes. She peers deep into the shop and sees - \nMADELEINE, a young woman bent over a workbench painting a doll's face, oblivious to being watched. \nINT. OPERA STAIRCASE \nLouis and Claudia hurrying hand in hand with a crowd of mortals towards the sound of an ORCHESTRA TURNING beyond. \nINT. NOTRE DAME \nClaudia and Louis standing in the deep shadows, looking at the branching arches. Louis is overcome with sadness, Claudia is fascinated. \nINT. GALLERY \nLouis and Claudia walk among a series of mythological nudes by Poussin. \nINT. SALON - NIGHT \nClaudia, surrounded by discarded dresses and outfits, being attended by couturiers. All the clothes are tiny, to fit her frame, but have an adult cut and shape. \nLOUIS We were alive again. We were in love and so euphoric was I that I yielded to her every desire... \nINT. SUMPRUOUS HOTEL SUITE \nFull of late 19th century furniture, lots of Empire style, Regency, gilt, velvet and brocade. \nCLOSE ON A HUGE BLACK EBONY CHEST \nAgainst a wall, solemn among all the light and glitter. \nCLAUDIA \nBy a large gilt mirror, in her new clothes. She is covered with jewelry, fixing earrings to her ears. \nCLAUDIA Help me, mon chere... \nLouis walks over, helps her with the earrings. \nCLAUDIA How do I look? \nLOUIS Still my beautiful child. \nClaudia laughs. \nCLAUDIA A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am? \nLOUIS Yes... \nHe turns away. \nCLAUDIA Why do you turn away? Why don't you look. \nShe twirls, looking at herself in the mirror, then stops, stares at herself. \nCLAUDIA You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you? \nLOUIS Yes. \nLOUIS Trickster. Buffoon! \nSantiago echoes the first word, but not the second. Louis has broken his composure. He turns his back on Santiago, only to come face to face with Santiago right in front of him. \nAgain Louis turns this back to find Santiago facing him. \nLouis turns, glowers, refusing to look at him. \nLOUIS I've searched the world for an immortal and this is what I find? \nSlowly he looks up. Santiago draws close, breaking the mirror trick and suddenly slams Louis back against the wall. \nLouis is furious. He regains his balance, strikes out at Santiago and when Santiago vanishes, to reappear behind him, Louis slams back his elbow into his midriff. Santiago staggers, amazed and then rushes at Louis, throwing him down. \nLouis rolls back to his feet, then to his amazement sees two vampires, on in front, on behind. He looks both ways, then sees one has vanished. He stares, awestruck, at this new one: \nARMAND He looks like an angel. \nARMAND You are all right. \nHe reaches into his waistcoat, takes an engraved invitation out of his pocket and thrusts it at Louis. \nLouis reads it aloud, as we see: \n\"THEATRE DES VAMPIRES By Special Invitation Friday, 9 p.m.\" \nARMAND Bring the petit beauty with you. No one will harm you. I won't allow it. Remember my name. Armand. \nArmand bows and vanishes. \nLouis listens to the silence. \nEXT BOULEVARD DES CAPUCHINES - THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - NIGHT \nLouis formally dressed with Claudia in rich attire on his arm. They pass people buying tickets for the theatre and go inside. \nLOUIS Remember what I've told you. They'll have different powers. They'll read your thoughts if you allow it. \nThey draw close to: \nHUGE POSTERS \nReading - \n\"THEATRE DES VAMPIRES PRESENTS THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH By Edgar Allen Poe\" \nThe posters are illustrated with cliched images of vampires overcoming damsels in distress. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nCLAUDIA But this can't be real. This is nonsense. \nLOUIS Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen. \nWarily, they show their invitations to the mortal ticket taker at the door. He glances away indifferently. \nINT. THEATRE BOX - NIGHT \nClaudia and Louis look at the crowd as the lights go down. \nCLAUDIA Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink. \nLOUIS They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound. \nStage: curtain rises. \nAn elaborate painted set of an Italianate castle. Death standing before it, the traditional image of the Grim Reaper, complete with magnificent scythe. \nLOUIS (whispers) It's a vampire. It's the one I saw in Rue St Jacques. \nA version of the Poe story unfolds before them. All of the participants are vampires. All beautiful gleaming white, aged 20 or 30. \nLOUIS They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint. \nCLAUDIA How devilishly clever. \nA spotlight uncovers a mortal woman suddenly forced out upon the stage. \nCLAUDIA She's no vampire. \nLOUIS No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is. \nThe audience laughs uneasily, then stops as the Mortal Woman comes into the footlights. She is too beautiful, too confused. Santiago, as Death, advances on her. She backs away, terrified, then sees the other vampires, in a phalanx, advancing from behind, in a half-circle. \nMORTAL WOMAN I don't want to die! \nClaudia appears suddenly to Louis' shoulder, interrupting. \nCLAUDIA Come, beloved. It's time we were on our way. I'm hungry and the city waits. \nShe stares hard at Armand. Armand looks from her to Louis. \nARMAND So soon to go? \nHe seems genuinely regretful. But Claudia pulls Louis out. \nINT. DARKENED CORRIDORS AND THEATRE - NIGHT \nLouis and Claudia feel their way through darkened corridors, trying to find their way out. \nLOUIS (V.O.) The place was dark as we left, a darkness that confounded even Claudia. And as we blundered through it, again came the thought: I have wronged Lestat, I have hated him for the wrong reasons. \nSuddenly a light comes on. They see they are in the empty theatre. Santiago stands on the stage, under a candle. \nSANTIAGO How did you wrong him? \nLouis is stunned. \nLOUIS You read my thoughts? \nSANTIAGO You said a name - \nLOUIS A name I don't want to say again. \nSANTIAGO I seemed to recognize it... \nOther vampires appear behind him. \nSANTIAGO There is but one crime among us vampires here. \nHe looks at Claudia. \nSANTIAGO You should know, who are so secretive about the vampire who made you. \nClaudia laughs. \nCLAUDIA Boredom! \nSANTIAGO It is the crime that means death to any vampire. To kill your own kind! \nCLAUDIA Aaaah! I was so afraid it was to be born like Venus out of the foam, as we were! Come Louis, let's go! \nEXT. HOTEL SAINT GABRIEL - NIGHT \nClaudia and Louis enter the Lobby. \nCLAUDIA I loathe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them! \nLOUIS What danger? \nCLAUDIA I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules! \nThey come to their room, enter. \nINT. HOTEL ROOMS - NIGHT \nLouis closes the door behind him. Claudia paces. \nLOUIS Do you think I would let them harm you? \nCLAUDIA No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me. \nLOUIS Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you. \nCLAUDIA Love? \nShe smiles at him. A strange, sad, adult smile. \nCLAUDIA You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you. \nLOUIS Never. \nCLAUDIA He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do. \nLOUIS That's not so. \nCLAUDIA Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance... \nLOUIS So you felt it too! \nCLAUDIA Let him go, he said. Let him go. \nLESTAT \nDressed beautifully, but horribly scarred now, from the fire as well as the earlier stabbing. Lestat is confused, ancient, teetering, reaching for Santiago's shoulder to steady himself. \nLESTAT Louis... \nSANTIAGO Is he the one? \nLestat shakes his head. \nLESTAT No, the child. The child was the one... \nSANTIAGO All the murderers!!! \nLOUIS You are alive, Lestat! It can't be murder! Tell them how you treated us... \nLestat reaches out to Louis. \nLESTAT No... You come back to me Louis... \nLOUIS Are you mad??? \nESTELLE The sentence is death! To all of them!!! \nLESTAT Only the girl - it was the girl - \nThe sound of something being dragged through the crowd. Horrible echoing, scraping - \nLestat grips Santiago. \nLESTAT You promised me - I could take him back to New Orleans - Louis - there's something I must tell you - about that night - that night I met you - \nHe stares around him, confused. The scraping gets louder. \nLOUIS You let her go, Lestat - you let her free - and I'll come back with you - \nSantiago grabs Louis by the neck. \nSANTIAGO Death for the others. For you eternity in a box - \nWe see now what caused the scraping. A huge metal coffin being dragged through the vampires. Claudia screams. \nSANTIAGO Walled in a dungeon. Your only company will be your screams... Perhaps it will take centuries... \nThe vampires grab Louis. They force him towards the coffin. Lestat struggles with them. \nLESTAT He's coming home with me - you promised - \nSANTIAGO (laughing) We promised nothing! \nLouis struggles fiercely as he is forced into the coffin. Claudia weeps. \nLOUIS They've fooled you, Lestat! You must reach Armand! Armand has the power! \nLouis, struggling in the coffin. Then the lid is forced down, huge locks closed over it. \nINT. COFFIN \nLouis, in the smallest imaginable space. Beating his forehead against the metal. \nEXT. COFFIN \nClaudia, throwing herself on the coffin, crying. She is dragged away. Vampire hands drag the coffin across the stone floor. \nINT. COFFIN \nLouis, forehead pouring with blood, being thrown this way and that. The coffin is lifted, upside down, Louis' head crashes off the floor. \nEXT. COFFIN \nIs thrust into a niche in the wall. Bricks being placed over, mortar trowelled on. \nINT. COFFIN \nLouis upside down. Sounds of bricks and mortar. Then terrifying, unearthly scream pierces the coffin, striking to his very soul. \nLOUIS Claudia!!! \nHe loses consciousness. \nBLACKNESS \nINT. COFFIN \nLouis sleeps, upside down. Sound of bricks being broken, thrown aside. Then of locks breaking. \nLooking at the paling sky. He is in an alleyway, outside of Armand's cell. He has a huge keg with him. he finds the door unlocked. He enters. \nINT. CELL \nEmpty. The hearth is cold. The old coffin is gone. Louis silently closes the door to the passage and blocks it with an immense bar. He goes in the other door. \nINT. THEATRE \nLouis hurls kerosene all over the stage, the curtain, the sets, the seats below. He grabs the scythe from the playlet. He walks out. Dribbling a trail of kerosene behind him. \nINT. STAIRS \nLouis walking rapidly down, leaving the trail of kerosene. He creeps quietly into the - \nBALLROOM \nLeaking kerosene from the cask. He splashes over the coffins that gleam in the dimness. \nThen he strikes a match and heaves it into the kerosene. Everything bursts into flame. The trail of kerosene roars into fire through the ballroom over the coffins and up the stairs. We hear EXPLOSIONS of fire from above. \nLOUIS \nShudders all over, fighting the morning weakness. He readies the scythe, like the grim reaper. \nESTELLE \nRises from her burning coffin, screams and tries to run through the fire but Louis slashes her down with the scythe and she goes down screaming, her dress in flames. \nESTELLE Stop him. It's morning. The sunlight. Stop him. \nOthers rise, choking in the smoke. Screams from everywhere. They are burning. \nLouis backs up the stairs to the - \nDUNGEON \nHe can see there a thin pale light under Armand's bolted door. Suddenly - \nSANTIAGO \nComes at him from behind. Louis turns. Santiago rushes him in a blur. Louis swings the scythe, too fast to see what he himself is doing. Santiago's head streaming blood flies through the air. \nThe body drops, flapping its arms. \nSCREAMS come from everywhere. \nAnother vampire rushes burning towards Louis. He decapitates him in turn. Then he staggers into Armand's cell, and bars the door the connects it to the ballroom behind him. He staggers to the outer door. There is a thin strip of daylight, beneath the door, blinding him. He throws it open, and staggers into the daylight. \nEXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - DAWN \nLouis staggers out of the burning theatre, into the thin daylight. Great gusts of smoke cover the street. He staggers through the daylight, weakening, about to fall, when through the clouds of smoke comes - \nA MAGNIFICENT HEARSE \nAs in a dream, driven by Armand's human boy. The door of the hearse opens. Through the curtains enclosing the interior, we see Armand. He reaches a hand out to Louis and pulls him inside. \nThe hearse vanishes through the smoke, leaving the spectacle of the burning theatre. \nEXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - TWILIGHT \nThe gutted Theatre and ballroom, the roof collapsed, exposed to the evening sky. The life of Paris goes on around it, oblivious. \nINT. LOUVRE - NIGHTS LATER \nIt is already a museum by this time and Louis and Armand, fancily dressed and composed, walk through it. They stop by a Gericault - The Wreck of the Medusa. \nLOUIS You didn't even warm them, did you? \nARMAND No. \nLOUIS And yet you knew what I would do. \nARMAND I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn. \nLOUIS You were their leader. They trusted you. \nARMAND You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes. \nHe looks at Louis affectionately. \nARMAND Your melancholy eyes... \nLOUIS What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we? \nARMAND We are a pair, and that's what counts. \nLESTAT I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me... \nLOUIS That's all past, Lestat. \nLESTAT Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us... \nHe turns and looks at Louis. Old, fearful, broken. \nLESTAT Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one. \nLOUIS Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm. \nLESTAT You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me? \nLouis shakes his head. A series of police sirens go by, piercing the night sky. A helicopter goes overhead. Red flashes illuminate his face. Lestat shivers, covers his ears. He's terrified. Louis touches him, calming him, until the lights pass over. \nLOUIS It's only a siren... \nLESTAT I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day! \nLOUIS And they frighten you? \nLESTAT You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore. \nLOUIS It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you... \nLESTAT If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat. \nLouis shivers. He releases him. \nLOUIS I have to go now Lestat... \nLESTAT You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat... \nLOUIS Yes. I remember... \nLestat shivers. \nLESTAT I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you. \nLOUIS I tried... \nLESTAT And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis. \nLOUIS You have it... \nLouis walks slowly away from him. Lestat turns back to his candle, his magazine. \nLESTAT You'll come back, Louis... take me out... little by little... and maybe I'll be myself again... \nA bluebottle buzzes by him. His hand shoots out and grabs it, squeezes the blood. \nLOUIS (whispering) Yes, Lestat... \nON LOUIS \nAs he walks through the decayed house. His eyes are expressionless. \nLOUIS (V.O.) And my story ends there. But in fact it ended a long time ago, with Claudia's ashes in that theatre. My love died with her. I never really changed after that. What became of Lestat I have no idea. I go on, night after night. I feed on those who cross my path. But all my passion went with her yellow hair. I ma a spirit with preternatural flesh. Detached. unchangeable. Empty. \nINT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT (PRESENT) \nMalloy, staring at Louis. \nMALLOY No... it can't end like that... \nLOUIS But it has. There is no more to tell. \nMALLOY But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty? \nLOUIS It's over, I'm telling you... \nMALLOY You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself. \nLouis looks at the cassettes on the table. \nLOUIS Do what you want with it. Learn what you can. Give the story to others. \nMalloy rises. \nMALLOY You have another chance, Louis. Take me! Give me your gift, your power... \nLouis is slowly horrified, then outraged and angry. \nLOUIS Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you? \n", "test1_input": "He turns, sees her sitting in the darkness. She is wearing a tiny nightgown of stitched lace and pearls, weirdly adult and seductive. She comes towards him. \nCLAUDIA But I can't hate you Louis. \nShe sprays perfume over her body as she comes nearer. \nCLAUDIA Is this the aroma of a mortal child? \nShe whispers. \nCLAUDIA Louis. Lover. \nShe kisses his cheek. \nCLAUDIA I was mortal to you. You gave me your immortal kiss. You became my mother and my father. And so I'm yours. Forever. \nShe takes his face in her hands. \nCLAUDIA But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him. \nLOUIS He'll never let us go. \nClaudia smiles. \nCLAUDIA Oh... really? \nEXT. DOCKLANDS - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT \nA sailing ship, by the docks. Louis and Claudia talking to a shipping-clerk. \nLOUIS (V.O.) So we made plans. She was convinced there were others of our kind in Europe, that they would have the answers Lestat couldn't provide. Lestat whom she now hated, who she thought she could be free of. I doubted, but then she had a surprise in store... \nINT. FLAT - NIGHT \nLestat playing the piano. Louis reading. Claudia enters, wearing a cape and hat. She walks to the piano, sits at the end of the piano and stares at him as he plays. \nLESTAT What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me! \nCLAUDIA (sweetly) Does it? \nLESTAT Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you. \nCLAUDIA Is that supposed to frighten me? \nLESTAT You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both. \nCLAUDIA I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us. \nLESTAT Not you my dear. \nCLAUDIA You're a liar. But you upset my plans. \nLESTAT What plans? \nCLAUDIA I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were. \nLouis perks up, puzzled. \nLESTAT Stop pestering me then! \nCLAUDIA Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you. \nLESTAT Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess. \nClaudia stares at him for a moment. \nCLAUDIA Better than that. \nShe takes his hand and leads him into an inner room. Louis follows behind. \nCLAUDIA You haven't fed enough. I can tell by your color. \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nTwo beautiful youths, lying asleep on a couch, by a table full with a half-eaten meal. Lestat sighs. \nLESTAT Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them? \nCLAUDIA Drunk on brandy wine. A thimbleful. I thought of you when I saw them. \nLESTAT We forgive each other then? \nClaudia stares at him, sitting. She nods. \nLestat bites into the neck of one of the youths, sucks greedily and horribly. Claudia watches him without expression. He finished one, is about to take the other when he staggers. He looks at Claudia. \n", "test1_true": "CLAUDIA No. Laudanum. \nLestat stares wildly at her, tries to move towards her, then slips to the floor. \nLESTAT Laudanum! \nCLAUDIA Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm. \nLestat tries to rise. \nLESTAT Ah Louis, Louis, she killed them... and let me drink... \nLouis watches, appalled. He goes to move. \nCLAUDIA Don't Louis - \nLESTAT Louis, put me in my coffin... \nCLAUDIA I'll put you in your coffin. Forever. \nShe pulls a knife out from under her shawl, walks rapidly to him and slashes his throat. Blood explodes from it. \nLOUIS Claudia! Don't do this thing!!! \nLESTAT Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift - help me - \nClaudia lacerates his face. Blood pours from everywhere. She plunges the knife in his chest. He falls back, fangs bared, clutching the knife. Claudia leaps on him then, bites deep into his neck as he dies. Louis screams, runs forward, pulls her away. \nLOUIS What have you done, Claudia - \nHe drags her off Lestat, tries to pull her out of the room. She hisses at him. \nCLAUDIA Louis! Look what's happening to him!! \nLouis looks. The floor is a sea of blood. Lestat has begun to shrivel, as if he'd been a bag of blood. His skin is shriveling against his bones like parchment, his eyes are slipping back into his skull-like face. His lush, beautiful hair remains unchanged. But his clothes are virtually being emptied of the body. It is no more than bones, wrapped in paper and the pupils of the eyes suddenly roll up into the papered skull. \nLOUIS Lestat. Oh, God forgive us. \nCLAUDIA Don't mock me, Louis. Help me. \nShe stares at the shriveled skeleton in its skin wrapping. She is fascinated. She sees the vampiric blood flow all over the floor. She touches it and brings her finger to her lips. \nCLAUDIA Goodnight, sweet prince, may flights of devils wing you to your rest. \nLouis walks forward, touches the skeleton, the blonde hair. \nLOUIS He's dead, Claudia, dead. \nCLAUDIA The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead. \nShe stands up, all business suddenly. \nCLAUDIA Help me. We must get rid of him. \nShe drags the coverlet from the table, knocking the crockery over the dead youths, and wraps Lestat's skeleton in it. She takes a bunch of chrysanthemums and places them in his skeleton hands. \nCLAUDIA Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis? \nLOUIS Don't mock, Claudia... \nCLAUDIA The swamp... \nEXT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT \nLouis whipping the horses. Claudia beside him. Lestat's skeleton in the back, with the bodies of the two dead youths. \nCLAUDIA In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means. \nLOUIS And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge. The carriage pulls up by a swamp. Mist everywhere. Overhanging creepers. \nLOUIS And if we find the one who made him? Do we tell him we destroyed his own creation? The vampire Lestat? \nLouis drags out the bodies of the boys. He slides them into the waters of the swamp. We see ripples in the water and the churning of alligators, as they attack the corpses. Louis takes Lestat's skeleton in his arms. He slides it into the waters. The alligators speed towards it. \nCLAUDIA He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die. \nLOUIS Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is. \nCLAUDIA I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free. \nHe stands there, saying nothing. \nCLAUDIA Louis, look at me. \n", "test2_input": "Shakes her head. She is helpless. \nSANTIAGO We alone can give death meaning. Do you know what it means to be loved by death, to become our bride? \nMortal Woman looks up on the verge of hysteria or fainting. But then her eyes mist over. She is being entranced. \nFROM HER POV \nWe realize she is looking past Santiago at the divinely beautiful Armand, who has just stepped out of the wings. Armand has entranced her. He passes Santiago. Santiago stiffens, but yields the stage. \nARMAND No pain. \nMORTAL WOMAN No pain? \nArmand takes her by the naked shoulders. \nARMAND Your beauty is a gift to us. \nON THE STAGE \nArmand gestures to the others who slowly, gracefully close in. \nARMAND Who deserves such a gift? \nHe pulls the drawstring from her skirt and it falls revealing her nakedness. But she is spellbound. \nMORTAL WOMAN No pain... \nArmand embraces her, drinks, her naked body stark against her black clothes, then he passes her to the other vampires one by one. \nCLOSE ON LOUIS \nWho battles desire and hunger with anger. \nLOUIS I've seen enough of this! I loathe it! \nCLAUDIA Be still! \nON THE STAGE \nThe naked Mortal Woman lies dead on the floor. The vampires seem to vanish one by one. As the curtain draws across, the Audience loudly applauds what they presume are theatrical tricks. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe audience, milling towards the exits. They talk in vacuous terms about the beauty of the show, the symbolism of it, the daring of it as they leave. \nGradually Louis and Claudia are left alone in the empty theatre. Louis seems anxious to leave. Claudia whispers in his ear. \nCLAUDIA Patience, Louis. Patience. \nHe looks around the empty theatre, more eerie now than when the play was on. The red curtain shifts slightly in a hidden breeze, a candle sputters and dies in a box. Then the candle flares again, and we see Armand in the box, looking down on them. He stares with a dreamy expression, saying nothing. \nLOUIS We've been searching for you for a very long time... \nHis voice echoes eerily. Armand gestures for them to follow him. \nINT. FOOT OF STAIRWAY \nArmand leading, Louis and Claudia following. It opens into a - \nHUGE UNDERGROUND BALLROOM \nWalls are painted with famous copies of Durer, Brueghel, Goya and Bosch depictions of death. Fine wooden coffins line the walls. Candles burn in sconces, casting alternate shadows and pools of light. Armand walks through, gesturing Louis and Claudia to follow him. \nAs they walk through, vampire man and women appear out of the shadows like wraiths, startling them, drifting around them, stroking them, touching Claudia as if she were a doll. Shrieks of preternatural laughter. \nArmand gestures to the vampires to back off. \nAll obey but ESTELLE. \nESTELLE Such a darling. \nShe menaces Claudia, her breasts enormous, her fangs bared. Armand throw her a look, and she is flung against the wall. \nLouis stares around. The vampires faces drift towards him and away, always disclosing the face of Armand, who seems some distance away, but strangely close, staring at Louis with a constantly calm, hypnotic gaze. Then a young mortal boy comes from the shadows with a candelabra, which he hands to Armand. \nArmand and the boy come towards them, leading them along the walls, his candelabra illuminating the ghastly murals, his face gleaming like an angel above the candleflame. \nLOUIS Monstrous. \nARMAND Yes, and very beautiful. \nLOUIS Your lips, they didn't move. \nARMAND They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed. \n", "test2_true": "ARMAND He wants you... \nLouis is utterly confused. Can't resist. Drinks his blood. \nThe boy's body presses against him, sensual, willing. The other vampires appear all around Louis, who suddenly senses it and draws away, ashamed. \nClaudia watches warily, from a distance. Armand beckons at her and Louis and open a door in the wall which reveals a stone staircase. \nINT. MEDIEVAL ROOM \nMedieval chairs, table, an old coffin, a bed in one corner, a blazing fire. A medieval painting of Satan, being banished from heaven, above the fire. Armand places the boy on the bed, settling him so he sleeps. \nARMAND Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe... \nLOUIS We had feared we were the only ones... \nARMAND But how did you come into existence? \nHe glances at Louis, then at Claudia, who averts her eyes. \nARMAND You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away. \nLOUIS Are you the leader of this group? \nARMAND If there were a leader, I would be the one. \nClaudia stares at him constantly, guarded. \nLOUIS So you have the answers... \nARMAND Ah! You have questions? \nLOUIS What are we? \nARMAND Nothing if not vampires... \nLOUIS Who made us what we are? \nARMAND Surely you know the one who made you... \nLOUIS But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil... \nLouis looks at the picture. Armand watches him. \nARMAND That is a picture, nothing more. \nLOUIS You mean we are not children of Satan? \nARMAND No. \nHe smiles at Louis. A smile of infinite compassion. \nARMAND I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good? \nLOUIS Then there is nothing. \nARMAND Perhaps... \nHe passes his finger through the candle flame. \nARMAND And perhaps this is the only real evil left... \nLOUIS Then God does not exist... \nARMAND I have not spoken to him... \nLOUIS And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil? \nARMAND None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world. \nHe stares at them, his face angelic, hypnotic, young. His eyes hold them both in a trance. \nLOUIS My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing. \nARMAND You fell too much. So much you make me feel... \nHe stares from Claudia to Louis. He seems to be reading their souls. \nARMAND The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new... \nLOUIS He knew nothing. He just didn't care. \nARMAND Knew? You mean he is... \n", "test3_input": "ARMAND Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart. \nLouis is speechless. \nARMAND Are these not the answers you came for? \nLOUIS (softly) Yes... My God... \nARMAND A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you - \nLOUIS Lestat! You knew Lestat! \nARMAND Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing. \nArmand stands. He takes Louis by the arm, leads him towards the back wall. \nARMAND But you must go now. You must get her safely out of Paris. \nHe opens a hidden door in the wall. \nARMAND No-one else knows of this door. When you knock you will find me waiting... \nEXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - NIGHT \nLouis, in the street outside, as the door closes behind him. \nLOUIS (V.O.) I felt a kind of peace at last. I had found the teacher which Lestat could never, I knew now, have been. I knew knowledge would never be withheld by Armand. It would pass through him as through a pane of glass. And I knew Claudia must leave me... \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT \nLouis enters. There is unfamiliar scent in the air, a doll sitting by the mirror. Louis looks in the mirror and sees... \nMADELEINE \nThe doll-maker, resplendent in green taffeta, sitting like a Madonna with Claudia on her lap. Claudia's arms are wound round her neck. The contrast between mortal woman and immortal child is plain. \nCLAUDIA Madeleine... Louis is shy. \nMadeleine rises and comes towards Louis. She draws back the lace fringes round her throat, so he can see the two marks there. She says softly, dreamily. \nMADELEINE Drink. \nLouis turns away. Claudia speaks, icy, from the bed. \nCLAUDIA Do it Louis. Because I cannot do it. I haven't the strength. You saw to that when you made me. \nLouis turns to Madeleine. \nLOUIS You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask! \nMADELEINE Au contraire, monsieur, I have. \nLouis pushes her away. Claudia screams. \nCLAUDIA You have found your new companion, Louis! You will make me mine! \nLouis grips Madeleine and shakes her. \nLOUIS How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become? \nCLAUDIA Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer! \nLOUIS Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it! \nCLAUDIA Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me. \nShe points to Madeleine \nCLAUDIA You give her to me! Do this before you leave me! \nShe begins to weep, sobbing like a child. \nCLAUDIA Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis... \nLOUIS Yes... \nCLAUDIA And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone? \nLouis looks at Madeleine \nLOUIS You promise to care for her then? \nMADELEINE Yes... \nLOUIS And you know what you ask for? \n", "test3_true": "MADELEINE Yes. \nLOUIS What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll? \nMADELEINE A child who can't die... \nHer finger clutches a locket around her neck, Louis touches it, opens it. \nTHE LOCKET \nA picture of a young girl, Claudia's age, wistful, beautiful. \nLOUIS (softly) And the child who did die? \nMADELEINE My daughter... \nLouis takes her chin in his hand, gently. \nLOUIS Look at the gaslight. Don't take your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me? \nMADELEINE Yes! \nLouis pulls her to him and starts to drink her blood. \nEXT. HOTEL BALCONY - LATER \nLouis on the balcony, weakened terribly. A breeze blows on the gauze curtains behind him, through which we see... \nSILHOUETTES of Madeleine and Claudia. Madeleine her arms outstretched, now a vampire, a long moan of pain coming from her. Claudia comes through the curtains, alarmed. \nCLAUDIA (whispers) Louis! \nLouis speaks without turning. \nLOUIS She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember. \nCLAUDIA But if she dies... \nLOUIS It's only mortal death. \nHe turns to look at Claudia. \nLOUIS Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even. \nCLAUDIA What do you mean? \nLOUIS What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps years. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human. \nShe takes his hand. \nCLAUDIA Yes father. At last. We are een. \nHe bends down and kisses her. He looks up, at the wafting curtains. He sees - \nMANY VAMPIRE SHADOWS \nSilhouetted, coming closer. \nCLAUDIA \nLooks up and screams. \nTHE CURTAINS \nAre ripped aside. The vampires of the Theatre surge through. \nESTELLE Time for justice, little one. \nThe vampires close on them as Louis struggles, Claudia's scream pierces the night air. \nINT. CORRIDOR OF THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - NIGHT \nIn a press of vampires, Louis, Claudia and Madeleine are forced down the dark corridor. Into - \nTHE BALLROOM \nVampire chaos, as they are dragged through. Louis struggling like a demon. \nLOUIS Armand! Get me Armand! he wouldn't countenance this - \nSANTIAGO You can make no demands here! Buffoon! Bastard - \nSantiago strikes Louis to the ground. As he struggles to his feet, he sees the vampires part around a figure coming through. He gasps at the sight of - \n"}

{"test1_input": "LOUIS Yes... \nLestat floats down on top of him, then lifts him in the air, draws his head back by the hair and sinks his teeth in his neck. \nON LOUIS' FACE \nEvery muscle rigid, teeth clenched, as the blood is drained from him. \nON THEIR FEET \nHovering above the ground, like two quivering dancers. \nTHE WIND billows through the ghostly white sails and rigging of the boats around the wharf. \nLESTAT \nFloats higher, with Louis in his arms, draining his blood. One hand reaches out and grips a rope, hanging from a shipmast. The other holds Louis. He withdraws his teeth, and looks into Louis' drained face. \nLESTAT You still want death? Or have you tasted it enough? \nLouis can barely get the words out. \nLOUIS Enough... \nLestat smiles and lets him go. Louis falls and plummets into the water below. \nLOUIS' FACE \nComing to the surface, in the water lapping by the wharf. The bodies of the whore and thief float beside him. He looks up and sees Lestat way above him, dangling from the rope of the shipmast. \nINT. ROOM - SAN FRANCISCO \nON MALLOY'S FACE \nCaptivated, terrified, enthralled. \nMALLOY That's how it happened? \nLOUIS No. The Gift of Darkness requires more than that, as you'll see. \nEXT. WATERFRONT - DAY \nLouis floating by mudflats, surrounded by dead fish, the carcasses of animals, eighteenth century rubbish. He gets to his feet and walks weakly through the mudflats. The sun is coming up over the sea behind him. \nLOUIS (V.O.) He left me half dead that morning. he wanted something from me. He came back the following night. \nINT. LAVISH FRENCH-FURNISHED BEDROOM AT POINT DU LAC \nLouis is delirious in a four-poster bed, shrouded with mosquito netting. A female slave, YVETTE, bathes his face with a rag. She is crying. Other slave women hover in the shadows. Yvette puts out all candles save one by the bed, and withdraws, with the others. \nCandlelight flickers on the face of the bisque virgin. \nLouis tosses and turns, dreaming, murmuring incoherently. Then he opens his eyes. \nLESTAT, exquisitely dressed in French clothing, stands by the bed smiling. In the light of the candle we see that he is not human; skin too white; eyes too bright. Lestat looks amiable, even mischievous, but impossible - and angel or monster. \nLouis grabs his pistol from the table and cocks it. \nLOUIS Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house? \nLESTAT And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it? \nLouis takes aim. Lestat puts his hand over the barrel. Louis fires. The bullet tears a hole in Lestat's hand. Lestat is unfazed. He takes the gun from Louis' hand and throws it away. His hand begins to heal. \nLESTAT You're not afraid of anything, are you? \nLOUIS Why should I be? \nLouis reaches for his sword, hanging by the bed, and point it. Lestat laughs indulgently. He draws closer. \nLESTAT Are you going to put that through me too? Ruin my beautiful clothes? \nHe comes closer to Louis, right up to his face, so the sword passes through his waistcoat. \nLESTAT Were all last night's promises for nothing? \nHe reaches out with his now-healed hand and plucks out the sword. \nLOUIS What do you want from me? \nLESTAT I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it? \nLestat sits down on the bed, drawing up one knee. Louis is becoming spellbound. \nLESTAT The wine has no taste. The food sickens you. There seems no reason for any of it, does there? But what if I could give it back to you? Pluck out the pain and give you another life? And it would be for all time? And sickness and death could never touch you again? \n", "test1_true": "DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT \nThe camera drifts through the graveyard where Louis' wife is buring. Everything is lit with an eerie glow, as if seen through some unearthly eye. \nLESTAT Vampires, that's what we are. Creatures of darkness, only we see it that darkness more clearly than any mortal has ever seen... \nLouis and Lestat drifting, dreamlike, through the overhanging vines, comes to the grave of his wife and child. Above the crypt, the statue of angel, mother and child. \nLESTAT Wouldn't it be sweet to bid pain goodbye? To wave away anguish and grief? To embrace the peace of the unending night? \nThe marble fingers of the child on the statue move. The angel raises her head and has the face of Louis wife, Diane. she raises her hand and touches Louis tear- streamed face. The child speaks. \nMARBLE CHILD Papa... \nLouis reaches out to embrace them and finds himself touching cold marble. He cries out in anguish- \nLOUIS Diane!!!! \nLESTAT They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy... \nLOUIS NO!!!!! \nINT. LOUIS BEDROOM - NIGHT \nLouis, thrashing on the bed in a delirium. Lestat places a hand on his forehead and soothes him. \nLESTAT You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me? \nLOUIS Give it to me!!! \nLESTAT Vampires. We thrive on blood. \nLOUIS I want it! \nLestat bends close as if to drink Louis' blood. Louis does not shrink back, but stares into his eyes. Lestat draws back, then stands up and goes to the French doors. \nLESTAT Tomorrow night. You must prove yourself. I will give you the choice I never had. \nHe looks outside. \nLESTAT The sun's coming up. Watch it carefully. If you come with me tomorrow, you'll never see it again. \nHe leaves. Louis sits dazed, staring at the empty French window. The sun rises with unnatural beauty, over the swamplands and the plantation, filling the room, striking water-pitcher, glass, mirror, and the picture of his dead wife. \nLOUIS (V.O.) My last sunrise. That morning I was not yet a vampire, and I saw my last sunrise. I remember it completely, yet I don't remember any sunrise before it. I watched the whole magnificence of the dawn for the last time, as if it were the first. And the I said goodbye to sunlight and went out to become what I became. \nEXT. PLANTATION - NIGHT \nLestat and Louis walk through the slave quarters, huddles groups around fires, music, singing. The sound of whipping is heard. \nLESTAT Your grief has unhinged you. You've let your estate rot. \nIn the woods beyond the quarters, the white overseer is whipping a black slave, with horrifying savagery. \nLESTAT You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him. \nLOUIS How do you mean, start? \nLESTAT Call him. \nLouis calls. \nLOUIS Carlos!!! \nThe overseer turns and comes towards them, with the bloodied whip. \nLESTAT Why the bloody whip, Carlos? \nThe overseer looks into his eyes, shivers with terror, drops the whip and runs for the trees. Lestat is on him in an instant. He sinks is teeth in his neck. Louis runs to him, tries to pull him off. But Lestat turns to Louis and smiles, with his bloodied mouth. \nLESTAT Let's call that a start. \nLOUIS I can't do it. \nLESTAT You've just done it - \nLOUIS Kill me if you will, but I can't do this... \nHe flees, as Lestat ends to finish off the overseer. \nEXT. POINTE DU LAC - NIGHT \n", "test1_id": 1989, "test2_input": "MALLOY The story about stakes through the heart? \nLOUIS The same. As you would say today... Bull shit. \nMALLOY What about coffins? \nLOUIS Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity... \nEXT. MANSION - NIGHT \nLouis walks up the steps to the mansion. He looks now like a fully-fledged vampire. Yvette, the slave girl stares at him from the open doorway. Cascades of harpsichord music come from the interior. \nLOUIS (V.O.) Killing is no ordinary act. It is the experience of another's life for certain. That night I had lost my own life and taken another's. I was drowning in a sea of human guilt and regret, with all the heightened senses of a vampire... \nLouis enters the mansion, following the harpsichord music, as if in a dream. Yvette draws back as he approaches. \nINT. MANSION - NIGHT \nLouis wanders into the parlor, where Lestat is playing the harpsichord rapidly and exuberantly. Louis goes to a full-length mirror and sees his own reflection there - quite the perfect vampire. \nLESTAT Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven. \nLOUIS It can't be... \nLESTAT Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching. \nEXT. POINTE DU LAC \nDawn spreading over the plantation. \nINT. BASEMENT - POINTE DU LAC \nA brick walled storage room. Two coffins stand on the floor. Lestat enters with a lantern, Louis behind. Lestat is apprehensive and protective of Louis. He pulls back one lid ot reveal a satin interior. \nLESTAT You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes. \nLOUIS And if I don't? \nLESTAT The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too. \nLouis approaches the coffin, hands trembling as he peers into it. \nLESTAT Don't be afraid. In moments you'll be sleeping as soundly as you ever slept. And when you awake I'll be waiting for you, and so will all the world. \nLouis crawls into the coffin, fearful yet fascinated. \nLOUIS You told me something earlier. You said you didn't have a choice. Was that true? \nLestat smiles bitterly and nods. \nLESTAT Someday I'll tell you. We have a lot of time to talk to each other. You might say... we have all the time we shall ever need. \nHe closes the lid. \nTotal darkness. Sounds of Louis' panicked breathing. Of his prayer again. \nLOUIS Dear God, what have I done? \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nLouis and Lestat sitting at a sumptuous table, piled with uneaten food. Lestat is going through sheafs of documents. \nLOUIS (V.O.) I awoke the next evening to a different world. And I realized there are as profound differences between vampires as between human beings... \nLestat, totting up figures on a piece of paper. \nLESTAT Your wealth, dear Louis, is inestimable. Your income from cotton alone will keep us in comfort for a century. \nLouis just stares at him. \nLOUIS (V.O.) I sat there staring at him with contempt. He had the soul of a shopkeeper, he was the sow's ear out of which nothing fine could be made. I felt sadly cheated in having him as a teacher... \nLestat looks up at him and grins. \nLESTAT You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly. \nLOUIS Do you think so? \nYvette enters, stands behind him, staring at Lestat with loathing. \nYVETTE You are not hungry, sir... \nLESTAT Au contraire, my dear. He could eat a horse... \nLestat laughs loudly. Louis turns and looks at Yvette. Her beautiful forehead in the candlelight, the veins pulsing on her neck and her hands. \n", "test2_true": "Yvette returns his stare, troubled. \nLOUIS (V.O.) It was only as a vampire that I could see Yvette's beauty. Her fear of me increased my desire. \nYvette reaches for his uneaten plate. Louis stops her hand. Holds it for a beat too long, looking at the veins in her wrist. \nLOUIS I will finish it, Yvette. Now leave us. \nShe turns and runs from the table. Lestat leans towards him. \nLESTAT Can't you pretend, you fool? Don't give the game away. We're lucky to have such a home. \nHis hand snakes out under the table. It comes up holding a large grey rat. \nLESTAT Pretend to drink, at least. \nHe bares his fangs and slices the rat's throat. He pours the blood into a crystal glass. \nLESTAT Such fine crystal shouldn't go to waste... \nHe hands the glass to Louis. Louis drinks the blood and stares at it in surprise, then at the dead rat on the fine lace tablecloth. \nLESTAT I know. It gets cold so fast. \nLOUIS We can live like this? Off the blood of animals? \nLestat shrugs. \nLESTAT I wouldn't call it living. I'd call it surviving. A useful trick if you're caught for a month on a ship at sea. \nLestat strokes the belly of the dead rat, studying it sadly. \nLESTAT There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some... \nLOUIS Fascination... \nLESTAT Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle - \nHe throws the rat away. \nLOUIS But we can live without taking human life. It's possible. \nLESTAT Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport! \nHe rises. Louis follows. \nEXT. NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT \nA big, lavish drinking place with a raised stage. \nItalian actors in buffoonish costumes act crude commedia dell'arte on the stage. \nPlantation owners in soiled brocade, lace, crooked wigs watch the show as tavern wenches move about. \nLOUIS (V.O.) This was New Orleans, a magical and magnificent place to live. In which a vampire, richly dressed might attract no more notice in the evening than hundreds of other exotic creatures. \nLouis and Lestat by a table, in the shadow of a tree. Teresa, a tavern wench, sits on Lestat's lap, pouring drinks for the two of them. She lifts a fresh glass to Lestat's lips as he flirts with her. \nTERESA Come on, mon cher. The best in the colony. Once you touch this you'll never go to any other tavern again. \nLESTAT You think so, cherie? But what if I'd rather taste your lips? \nTERESA My lips are even sweeter still... \nShe kisses him. He lets his tongue play with hers, then runs it down her neck. She swoons with pleasure. Then he sinks his teeth gently in her neck, looking playfully behind at Louis, who if appalled and fascinated. \nANTICS ON THE STAGE \nLaughter rocks the tavern. \nLestat slips the pale and dead Teresa into a chair beside him and folds her hands on the table. No one notices. He lays gold coins on the table and touches Louis' knee. \nLESTAT Let's get out of here! \nLestat rushes out, thrilled with himself. \nEXT. TAVERN - NIGHT \nA crowded street. Louis and Lestat emerge from the tavern. Louis looks up at the moon. \nLOUIS Have you ever been caught? \nLESTAT Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them. \n", "test2_id": 1990, "test3_input": "He turns, sees her sitting in the darkness. She is wearing a tiny nightgown of stitched lace and pearls, weirdly adult and seductive. She comes towards him. \nCLAUDIA But I can't hate you Louis. \nShe sprays perfume over her body as she comes nearer. \nCLAUDIA Is this the aroma of a mortal child? \nShe whispers. \nCLAUDIA Louis. Lover. \nShe kisses his cheek. \nCLAUDIA I was mortal to you. You gave me your immortal kiss. You became my mother and my father. And so I'm yours. Forever. \nShe takes his face in her hands. \nCLAUDIA But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him. \nLOUIS He'll never let us go. \nClaudia smiles. \nCLAUDIA Oh... really? \nEXT. DOCKLANDS - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT \nA sailing ship, by the docks. Louis and Claudia talking to a shipping-clerk. \nLOUIS (V.O.) So we made plans. She was convinced there were others of our kind in Europe, that they would have the answers Lestat couldn't provide. Lestat whom she now hated, who she thought she could be free of. I doubted, but then she had a surprise in store... \nINT. FLAT - NIGHT \nLestat playing the piano. Louis reading. Claudia enters, wearing a cape and hat. She walks to the piano, sits at the end of the piano and stares at him as he plays. \nLESTAT What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me! \nCLAUDIA (sweetly) Does it? \nLESTAT Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you. \nCLAUDIA Is that supposed to frighten me? \nLESTAT You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both. \nCLAUDIA I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us. \nLESTAT Not you my dear. \nCLAUDIA You're a liar. But you upset my plans. \nLESTAT What plans? \nCLAUDIA I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were. \nLouis perks up, puzzled. \nLESTAT Stop pestering me then! \nCLAUDIA Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you. \nLESTAT Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess. \nClaudia stares at him for a moment. \nCLAUDIA Better than that. \nShe takes his hand and leads him into an inner room. Louis follows behind. \nCLAUDIA You haven't fed enough. I can tell by your color. \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nTwo beautiful youths, lying asleep on a couch, by a table full with a half-eaten meal. Lestat sighs. \nLESTAT Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them? \nCLAUDIA Drunk on brandy wine. A thimbleful. I thought of you when I saw them. \nLESTAT We forgive each other then? \nClaudia stares at him, sitting. She nods. \nLestat bites into the neck of one of the youths, sucks greedily and horribly. Claudia watches him without expression. He finished one, is about to take the other when he staggers. He looks at Claudia. \n", "test3_true": "CLAUDIA No. Laudanum. \nLestat stares wildly at her, tries to move towards her, then slips to the floor. \nLESTAT Laudanum! \nCLAUDIA Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm. \nLestat tries to rise. \nLESTAT Ah Louis, Louis, she killed them... and let me drink... \nLouis watches, appalled. He goes to move. \nCLAUDIA Don't Louis - \nLESTAT Louis, put me in my coffin... \nCLAUDIA I'll put you in your coffin. Forever. \nShe pulls a knife out from under her shawl, walks rapidly to him and slashes his throat. Blood explodes from it. \nLOUIS Claudia! Don't do this thing!!! \nLESTAT Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift - help me - \nClaudia lacerates his face. Blood pours from everywhere. She plunges the knife in his chest. He falls back, fangs bared, clutching the knife. Claudia leaps on him then, bites deep into his neck as he dies. Louis screams, runs forward, pulls her away. \nLOUIS What have you done, Claudia - \nHe drags her off Lestat, tries to pull her out of the room. She hisses at him. \nCLAUDIA Louis! Look what's happening to him!! \nLouis looks. The floor is a sea of blood. Lestat has begun to shrivel, as if he'd been a bag of blood. His skin is shriveling against his bones like parchment, his eyes are slipping back into his skull-like face. His lush, beautiful hair remains unchanged. But his clothes are virtually being emptied of the body. It is no more than bones, wrapped in paper and the pupils of the eyes suddenly roll up into the papered skull. \nLOUIS Lestat. Oh, God forgive us. \nCLAUDIA Don't mock me, Louis. Help me. \nShe stares at the shriveled skeleton in its skin wrapping. She is fascinated. She sees the vampiric blood flow all over the floor. She touches it and brings her finger to her lips. \nCLAUDIA Goodnight, sweet prince, may flights of devils wing you to your rest. \nLouis walks forward, touches the skeleton, the blonde hair. \nLOUIS He's dead, Claudia, dead. \nCLAUDIA The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead. \nShe stands up, all business suddenly. \nCLAUDIA Help me. We must get rid of him. \nShe drags the coverlet from the table, knocking the crockery over the dead youths, and wraps Lestat's skeleton in it. She takes a bunch of chrysanthemums and places them in his skeleton hands. \nCLAUDIA Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis? \nLOUIS Don't mock, Claudia... \nCLAUDIA The swamp... \nEXT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT \nLouis whipping the horses. Claudia beside him. Lestat's skeleton in the back, with the bodies of the two dead youths. \nCLAUDIA In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means. \nLOUIS And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge. The carriage pulls up by a swamp. Mist everywhere. Overhanging creepers. \nLOUIS And if we find the one who made him? Do we tell him we destroyed his own creation? The vampire Lestat? \nLouis drags out the bodies of the boys. He slides them into the waters of the swamp. We see ripples in the water and the churning of alligators, as they attack the corpses. Louis takes Lestat's skeleton in his arms. He slides it into the waters. The alligators speed towards it. \nCLAUDIA He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die. \nLOUIS Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is. \nCLAUDIA I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free. \nHe stands there, saying nothing. \nCLAUDIA Louis, look at me. \n", "test3_id": 1991}

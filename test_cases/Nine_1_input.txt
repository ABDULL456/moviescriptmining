CLAUDIA When there's a camera between us. 
GUIDO No. 
CLAUDIA It's not a real person, Guido. (pointed) And this man you describe - he doesn't know how to love. 
CLAUDIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, I OWE WHAT I AM TO YOU. 
EXT. PIAZZA WITH FOUNTAIN - NIGHT 
Claudia heads towards a little Piazza with an ancient fountain in the centre of the square. The Piazza is empty except for a few cars parked where the entrances have been blocked off. Claudia steps up onto the fountain. p. 79 
GUIDO There was a time once, we were on location, some terrible hotel - and you were in the room directly above me and I could hear you walking about... 
Guido sits down at the edge of the fountain. 
GUIDO (CONT'D) ...and, all through the night, I wanted to rush up the stairs and hammer on your door until you opened. 
CLAUDIA And why didn't you? 
GUIDO I don't know. I don't know. 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
CLAUDIA SPECIAL TO ME IN MY LIFE, SINCE THE FIRST DAY THAT I MET YOU. HOW COULD I EVER FORGET YOU, ONCE YOU HAD TOUCHED MY SOUL. IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, YOU'VE MADE ME WHOLE. 
EXT. PIAZZA WITH FOUNTAIN - NIGHT 
Claudia leaves behind the hat on the fountain and moves closer to Guido. The music continues. 
CLAUDIA Maybe you should have knocked, maybe you should have knocked me right off the pedestal. I can't do this anymore. 
She takes off her wig and diamond earrings. 
CLAUDIA (CONT'D) This is me.   And you have a wife who loves you. 
She hands him the wig and the earrings.    She kisses him. 
CLAUDIA (CONT'D) I'll miss you. Wrong girl. 
The music ends.   Claudia turns and walks away. p. 80 
INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT 
A screen, the leader of a film reel, numbers counting down, the synch pop on 3, and Claudia appears on the screen, looking extraordinary from the hair and makeup test. People start to comment, all enthusiastically. 
Guido gets a cigarette off Pierpaolo and lights up. 
DANTE (to Lilli) Great work, Lilli... Wonderful costume... 
LILLI Thank you. 
DANTE ...and the hair, makeup, fantastic. 
Guido watches, sitting alone, he turns around as he sees someone come in the door, but it's Gianluca, not Luisa. 
BENITO She has a beautiful profile. 
DANTE Two great profiles. 
FAUSTO She's a goddess. 
DANTE And the back isn't too bad.

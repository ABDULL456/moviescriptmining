MOZART Pupils? 
LEOPOLD Yes. 
MOZART Yes. 
LEOPOLD How many? 
MOZART I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition. 
LEOPOLD Composition doesn't pay. You know that. 
MOZART This one will. 
He picks up some pages of manuscript. 
LEOPOLD What's that? 
MOZART Oh, let's not talk about it. 
LEOPOLD Why not? 
MOZART It's a secret. 
LEOPOLD You don't have secrets from me. 
MOZART It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is! 
Constanze comes into the room. She is wearing a dressing gown and has made a perfunctory attempt to tidy her hair. We see that she is clearly pregnant. 
MOZART My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter? 
CONSTANZE Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart. 
MOZART He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa. 
LEOPOLD I see that you're expecting. 
CONSTANZE Oh, yes. 
LEOPOLD When, may I ask? 
CONSTANZE In three months! Papa. 
MOZART Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted. 
LEOPOLD Why didn't you mention it in your letters? 
MOZART Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did. 
He gives a little giggle of embarrassment. 
CONSTANZE May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart? 
MOZART Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you? 
CONSTANZE Wolfi! 
MOZART What? How can you be so boring? Tea! 
CONSTANZE Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here. 
LEOPOLD Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me. 
MOZART Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa! 
The jaunty tune of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein (K.539) sounds through all the following. This is an alternate song from Il Seraglio: a very extroverted tune for baritone and orchestra and a prominent part for bass drum. The vocal part should be arranged for trumpet. 
EXT. STREET IN VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S 
Mozart and Constanze with Leopold between them. We see couples shopping. 
INT. A COSTUME SHOP - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S 
This is a shop where one can buy costumes for masquerades. It is filled with extravagant costumes of various kinds. Wolfgang is wearing a costume, a mask pushed up on his forehead; Constanze is wearing a little white velvet mask. 
Amidst the merriment, Leopold is helped by two assistants to put on a dark grey cloak and a dark grey tricorne hat, to which is attached a full mask of dark grey. Its mouth is cut into a fixed upward smile. 
He turns and looks at his son through this mask. 
CUT STRAIGHT TO: 
INT. A LARGE PARTY ROOM - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S 
We are in the full whirl of a Masquerade Ball. Couples are dancing around dressed in fantastic costumes. The music of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein increases in volume and persists. We see the musicians thumping it out on a balustrade above the dancers. A steer is being roasted. Through the bobbing crowd we see a group, headed by the figure of Bacchus: this is Schikaneder in a Greek costume, wearing vine leaves in his hair. He is accompanied by his usual trio of actresses and three other men. Constanze as Columbine and Mozart as Harlequin are pulling Leopold by the hand of his dark cloak and smiling mask. This whole group threads its way across the crowded room and disappears through a door. As they go, they are watched by Salieri, standing alone in a corner, wearing ordinary evening clothes. He turns away hastily to avoid being seen by them. 
As soon as they disappear into the far room, Salieri goes quickly to a lady in the corner who is giving guests domino masks off a tray. He quickly takes a small black mask and puts it on. 
CUT TO: 
INT. A GROTTO ROOM NEXT DOOR - NIGHT - 1780'S 
A fantastic room designed as a rocky grotto, lit by candles. A forte-piano to one side is being played by Schikaneder: the music of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein cross-fades to another tune.  This is Vivat Bacchus from Il Seraglio which 
Schikaneder, dressed as Bacchus, is humming as he plays. The music is actually accompanying a game of Forfeits, which has begun. Five couples (the group we have just seen) are dancing in the middle of a ring made by nine chairs. When the music stops they will each have to find a chair, and the one who fails must pay a forfeit. 
Constanze is dancing with Leopold; Mozart is dancing with one of the actresses; the two other actresses are dancing with two other gentlemen; and two children dance together - a little boy and a little girl. The scene is watched by a circle of bystanders; among them - from the doorway - is Salieri. 
Schikaneder stops playing. Immediately the couples scramble for the chairs. Leopold and Constanze meet on the same chair, bumping and pushing at each other to get sole possession of it. To the amusement of the people around, the chair over- balances and they both end up on the floor. Constanze immediately gets up again, sets the chair on its feet, and tries to pretend she was sitting in it all the time. But Schikaneder calls out from the forte-piano. 
SCHIKANEDER No, no! You both lost. You both lost. You both have to forfeit. And the penalty is you must exchange your wigs. 
People are delighted by the idea of this penalty. The children jump up and down with excitement. The three actresses immediately surround Leopold, reaching for his hat and mask and wig, whilst he tries to hold on to them. Mozart takes off Constanze's wig - an absurd affair with side-curls. Constanze laughingly surrenders it. 
LEOPOLD No, please! This is ridiculous! No, please! 
Despite his protests an actress takes off his hat, to which the smiling mask is attached, to reveal his outraged face showing a very different expression underneath. Another actress snatches off his wig to reveal very sparse hair on the old man's head. The third actress takes Constanze's wig from Mozart and attempts to put it on his father's head. 
LEOPOLD No, really! 
MOZART (calling to him) This is just a game, Papa.

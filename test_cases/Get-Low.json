{"test1_input": "KATHRYN Get out of here. \nMATTIE He was. And I don't mean just the way he looked. \nKATHRYN I hope not. \nMATTIE Oh no, listen, he was beautiful. \nKATHRYN Are you serious? \nMATTIE \n(SIGHS/THINKS) Most people are just laid out nice and simple, you know? You always know what they're thinking and where you are with them. But he was this.. big old cave that went deeper and deeper. You'd never get to the end of him. \nKATHRYN Good Lord, you had a crush on him! \nMATTIE All the girls did. I know he's something wild that crawls out of the hills once in a while and gets into trouble now but there's still nobody like him. \n46 EXT. BUSH'S BARN - MORNING 46 \nBush comes out of the barn. Frank and Buddy are there. \nFRANK We have a plan. All we need is a little bit of your time. \nBUSH What for? \nBUDDY Seeing it is better than hearing about it. Bush looks at the hearse, back at Buddy and Frank. \nBUSH How much is it gonna cost? \nFRANK \n(TO BUDDY) Did you say anything about money? (touches his own chest) I didn't say anything about money. \n(TO BUSH) If we can't get you what you want you don't owe us anything. \n47 INT. HEARSE - DAY 47 \nFrank, Buddy, and Bush ride in the front seat of the hearse. They are together but in very different worlds. They don't even look at each other when they talk. Buddy is lost in serious thought. Frank is preoccupied about the deal and driving too fast. Bush is scrunched up to the door. He is going much faster than he is used to going. He kinda likes it and kinda doesn't. \nBUSH It moves, don't it? \nFRANK \n(DISTRACTED) This is nothing. \nBUSH Fancy car for the dead. \nFRANK Didn't buy it for them. \nBUDDY (out of nowhere) We say that funerals are \"For the Living\" but we forget what that means sometimes, I guess. (to Bush but almost to \nHIMSELF) I was thinking about your funeral party before I went to sleep last night and I think I understand it a little now. When I was a kid, my folks where killed in a bad car wreck and the people at the funeral home... they did the impossible as far as I was concerned. I don't know what I would've done without them. And I remember wishing that my mother and daddy were there to see how beautiful they made everything. Frank is hearing this for the first time and is shocked. Bush glances softly at Buddy then looks out the side window at the world rushing by too fast. All at once he gives in to it. \n48 EXT. TOWN STREET - DAY 48 \nThe hearse pulls up on main street. Frank, Buddy, and Bush get out and head toward Feldman's Clothing Store. \n", "test1_true": "Frank and Buddy enter the store and find MR. FELDMAN and a PHOTOGRAPHER setting up a large camera and backdrop. As they turn to show Bush what is happening they see him go by the window outside. \nFRANK Where's he going? \n49 OMIT 49 \n50 INT. TOLLERUDE'S BARBER SHOP - DAY 50 \nA barber's drape falls over BUSH who is seated in a chair. Frank and Buddy rush in. The barber, an anxious Mr. Tollerude, pumps Bush's chair upward. \nFRANK \n(TO BUSH) I wish you wouldn't do that yet. Bush gives him the hairy eyeball then speaks to Mr. Tollerude, a clear threat. \nBUSH Don't leave me naked. \nFRANK Mr. Bush, you can get all the hairs cut you want after we take your picture, I'll pay for it. Mr. Tollerude doesn't know whether to cut or not. \nBUSH Why you want my picture made? \nBUDDY That's what we're trying to tell you. We're gonna run an ad in some papers about your party and put up posters of you. \nBUSH And you want me to look like this? \nFRANK Yes. \nBUSH Why? \nFRANK Why? \nBUDDY It's how people recognize you, sir. \nFRANK And you want as many people to come as possible so.. \nBUSH So a crazy old nutter draws more. \nFRANK Basically. Don't you think? \nBUSH Do you ever say what you mean? Bush rips the bib off as Tollerude whooshes him to the floor. \n51 INT. FELDMAN'S CLOTHING STORE 51 \nBush is seated in front of a backdrop painted with a bridge, a swan, and a pond. The Photographer is trying to tidy up Bush without offending him. As he walks back to camera, Bush roughs himself up and looks truly wild. Buddy snickers. When the Photographer gets back to the camera, he cocks his head, what?! \nFRANK Take it. (leans in to Buddy) I'd go see that. \n52 INT. TOLLERUDE'S BARBERSHOP - DAY 52 \nMr. Tollerude, nervous as hell, brings Bush up from his reclining position and turns the chair to the mirror. Bush studies his well trimmed hair and beard for a moment. It's impossible to tell what his thoughts are as he looks into his own eyes. Buddy and Frank are in the mirror too, staring at him. \nBUDDY \n(GENUINELY SURPRISED) Damn. You look pretty good.. Bush suddenly gets up and nods at Frank. \nBUSH He's paying. As Bush blows out the door, Mr. Tollerude leans against the chair with relief. \n53 INT. FELDMAN'S CLOTHING STORE - DAY 53 \n", "test1_id": 921, "test2_input": "FRANK Every name, every dollar, is right there! \nBUSH Not what I asked. \nFRANK I've done a hell of a job for you. I don't see why.. \nBUDDY Mr. Bush, I didn't mean to imply.. \nBUSH Hush. \nFRANK I've sold horses, cars, houses, hell, pocket watches pinned to the inside of my coat. I'm not ashamed of it. I don't rob banks, don't cheat at cards, and I sleep all right the nights I sleep. What was the question..? \nBUSH They goddamn.. He nods at the money and suddenly becomes the \"other\" Bush. \nBUSH Take out for the expenses you've already had and give me the receipts. As the bills come in for things, give them to me and I'll pay them. Put this money in a box and the boy and I'll take it someplace in the morning. Whatever new comes in, keep it in the bottom of one of them ugly caskets in there 'till I come get it. After the party, name a fair price for what you've done and we'll settle up. \n(WALKING OUT) I'll be at the car. After he's gone, Frank and Buddy stare at each other. \nFRANK Is it just me or is he extremely fucking articulate when he wants to be? \nBUDDY I don't know who's selling who what anymore. \nFRANK It's not clear, is it? \nBUDDY Not only that but something feels really wrong. \nFRANK Hold on. I told you that you were working on commission.. \nBUDDY Yeah, but.. \nFRANK So whatever our end of this is, you get a piece. \nBUDDY A piece? \nFRANK Half. It could help set you up, Buddy. So whatever feels wrong is gonna feel right pretty damn quick,okay? We just have to close it out. From here on, watch me, do what I do, and we'll be fine. \nBUDDY But.. \nFRANK He wants you to go with him to take this money somewhere which means that it's you he trusts. And that's fine because I trust you too. Just don't trust him, okay? \nBUDDY I'm lost again. \nFRANK Look, that funny feeling you have.. I have it too. And it's not funny. So go along, be friendly, but that's it. \n(BEAT) There's a euphoria that comes with closing a deal, Buddy, and the bigger the deal, the higher you get. It's better than anything. \n(MORE) \nFRANK (CONT'D) But the critical time is just before it closes. It's like a witching hour and everything tries to come apart. We're not going to let that happen. \nBUDDY All right. \nFRANK Now go. (as Buddy starts out) You know.. I always wondered why you wanted to work here. I thought you could do a lot better. (off Buddy's look back) I didn't know about your folks, I'm really sorry. \nBUDDY Thank you. He goes on. Frank turns and flips through a large stack of bills, hungrily entranced. \n81 INT. BUDDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT 8 1 \n", "test2_true": "BUDDY I might have a crying fit coming on too. \nKATHRYN Is that right? \nBUDDY Feeling a little weepy. \nKATHRYN You boys.. \nBUDDY (leans against door frame) I can maybe do something really good for us, Katy. \nKATHRYN You already have. \nBUDDY I mean, money wise. \nKATHRYN About Mr. Bush? \nBUDDY Yeah. I'm getting half of whatever we make off of him. \nKATHRYN So why aren't you happy about it? \nBUDDY Didn't know I wasn't. (off her look) I was happy for a minute. And then the whole thing of making a carnival out of a person's death, I don't know if it's right. \nKATHRYN Is it what he wants? \nBUDDY He says it is. \nKATHRYN You are not responsible for what other people do, Buddy, just you. \nBUDDY You're right. You're always right. \nKATHRYN At least I am when I'm half naked. \nBUDDY Right. \n82 INT. MATTIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 82 \nA very determined little GIRL is working her way through a song on the piano that is unrecognizable in this form, even to her. Mattie sits just behind the girl with tears in her eyes, not really listening. On the table beside the piano is a stack of picture albums and old yellowed newspaper articles. \n83 EXT/INT BUSH'S SHACK/HEARSE - MORNING 83 Sitting in the hearse outside of Bush's shack, Buddy watches Bush get in the car with his shotgun. There is a big wooden box of money on the seat between them. Bush props his shotgun against it. \nBUDDY Where to, sir? \nBUSH North. \nBUDDY (starting the hearse) How far? \nBUSH Till I say, son. Buddy gives him an uneasy look and pulls off down the tree- lined path. \n84 EXT. ROAD - DAY 84 \nThe hearse slips around the narrow road that cuts through miles of farm land lying fallow in the winter. \n85 INT. HEARSE - DAY 85 \nBuddy looks out at the highway. He is driving slow. Bush is leaning against the money, thinking. \nBUDDY How much further now? Bush waves him on. Buddy scowls then decides to get serious about this. He presses on the accelerator and the hearse takes off down the highway. \n", "test2_id": 922, "test3_input": "BUSH Close the door. Charlie slams the door. Frank examines the wound. Buddy stares in shock at the old roping burns scars on Bush's chest. \nFRANK Missed the bone. Got any alcohol and clean rags? Bush nods at the cabinet. Charlie finds an amazing assortment of herbs and roots, alcohol and old sheets ripped into rags. \nBUDDY Why don't you sit down, sir? \nBUSH Boil some water and I'll tell you how to make me a poultice. Frank takes the rags and alcohol from Charlie \nFRANK This is gonna hurt. \nBUSH Don't sugar coat it. \n155 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 155 \nEveryone is standing around in shock. \n156 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 156 \nKathryn waits anxiously near the porch with the baby. \n157 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 157 \nHorton steps up to the microphone. The shocked crowd turns to him. He closes his eyes and bows his head. \nREVEREND HORTON Lord, you say you move in mysterious ways and we believe you because we don't understand much of anything. And so we come to you today not seeking answers to what's happened here but asking you to help us open our hearts a little more to each other and find some forgiveness and understanding. \n158 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 158 \nFrank has cleaned the wound. Buddy has made a poultice that Bush is pressing onto the wound as he hears the last of Horton's prayer over the loudspeakers. \nBUS H Pretty good prayer. Mighta been wrong about that preacher. \nCHARLIE Why don't you lay down, Felix? \nBush thinks about it, sees a way out. For a second he looks like he might take it. Then he shakes his head, puts a rag over the poultice and pulls his shirt up. \nBUSH Let's go 'fore I lose my nerve. \nBUDDY Are you sure? Bush scowls at the huge blood stain on his shirt. He looks at Frank's white shirt. Frank just stares at him. Bush keeps looking. Finally Frank sighs and starts loosening his tie. \n159 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 159 \nThe bluegrass band sings a good hymn. The crowd is still stunned and talking, not knowing what to do. \n160 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 160 \nBuddy gently helps Bush into his jacket, which has a bullet tear in it along the shoulder but Bush seems okay with it, to Frank's relief. Frank is putting on an old faded shirt of Bush's. As Bush starts for the door, he comes up beside Charlie. \nBUSH You ain't nervous? All them white folks out there? \nCHARLIE There's white folks here?! \nBUSH Stick with me, you'll be all right. \nCHARLIE You're the one they're shooting at. As Charlie opens the door, Bush stops, all his misgivings flooding in with the light. He looks at Buddy. \nBUSH Pretty interesting day so far, huh boy? Bush straightens himself up and goes out the door. \n", "test3_true": "Charlie, Bush walk through the murmuring parting crowd toward the stage. Frank and Buddy are close behind. Buddy is looking for Kathryn. She spots him and moves toward the stage. \n162 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 162 \nBush and Charlie go up the steps to the stage. At the last second, Bush stares at the big microphone and stops, unable to go on. Charlie gives him a look then goes on up to the microphone and looks out a the sea of white folks. \nCHARLIE I'm Reverend Charlie Jackson. Felix wants to continue with his funeral. And he's asked me to say a few words. Just below the stage, Buddy and Frank are joined by Kathryn. Charlie glances back at Bush, turns inward, searching for the words. Finally he holds his hands out, wide apart. \nCHARLIE We like to imagine that good and bad, right and wrong, are miles apart. But the truth is, very often they're.. (brings his hand together and laces his fingers \nTIGHTLY) .all tangled up with each other. Bush raises his head and looks at Charlie's back. \nCHARLIE Some 40 years ago Felix Bush dropped into my life and then dropped out. In between he built the most beautiful sanctuary that I've ever seen. A lot of wonderful things happened in that church. Suddenly Bush breaks away, moves up beside Charlie, and puts his hand on his shoulder. \nBUSH Thank you, Charlie. Thank you. Charlie gives him a long look then steps away from the microphone and moves back to where Bush was standing. Bush stares at the microphone, takes a breath, and walks up to it, and looks out over the huge crowd. \nBUSH Had to go clear to Illinois to find somebody that had anything good to say about me. Hell of a thing. His voice booms out over the crowd, startling him. He looks down, sees Buddy, Kathryn, Frank and Horton. He looks closer for someone most important but she is not there. The crowd murmurs. Finally.. \nBUSH I'm not a smart man or a wise one. I don't know what kind of man I am. I was always restless, thought I'd see the world. But I didn't hardly go nowhere.. on purpose.. \n(BEAT) Because.. because I did something that I was ashamed of. Something I couldn't ever fix. \n(GLANCES AROUND) Ya'll probably think you know what you'd do or what you wouldn't. And I wish you good luck with that. I really do. \n(BEAT) When I told Charlie what I'd done, he told me to confess to God and the law and to.. to someone else.. so I could get forgiveness. But I didn't want forgiveness. \n(BEAT) I needed to hold on to what I did.. to be sick from it every day of my life. So I never told nobody else. He stops, not knowing how to go on. The crowd has quieted completely. As as his eyes sweep over the sea of expectant faces, he suddenly SEES HER coming through the crowd. \nMattie's here. Seeing that Felix appears to alright, her face changes from conflicted concern to open unbridled hatred. The look takes Bush's breath away. But he suddenly seems to accept it as his due and when he talks, it is only to her. \nBUSH I fell in love with a married lady. And somehow she fell in love with me. It was the only time that I have been in love. \n(GATHERS HIMSELF) We made a plan to run off and start a new life but she didn't show up at the time that we said we'd meet. I got a funny feeling and I went to her house. Buddy, Kathryn and Frank all see Mattie now, see Bush talking just to her. \nBUSH Her husband answered the door. \n(BEAT) He had blood on him. For Mattie all of this is like window into the past being suddenly thrown open and she is haunted and mesmerized. \nBUSH I hit him pretty hard, knocked him down. Can't remember going upstairs but I remember I saw a hammer on the steps and it had blood and hair on it. The crowd gasps. Mattie is trembling. \nBUSH I found her in the bedroom. She was crawling across the floor. \n(BEAT) But before I could get to her and help her up.. a kerosene lamp hit the wall. And then her husband jumped on my back. Funny what happens sometimes when things go wrong. It's like the clock stops and you have all the time in the world to think. I could see that her husband had set the downstairs on fire before he came up. \n(BEAT) \n(MORE) \nBUSH (CONT'D) And as I was slamming his head into the wall, trying to get shed of him, I could see clear as anything that it was all my fault. If I'd just never spoke to her.. \n(BEAT) And as I was thinking about that, I saw that the lamp he threw had set the room we were in on fire too. Bush forces himself to keep looking into Mattie. \nBUSH And then I realized that I was on fire. I tried to put myself out but I couldn't, everything was.. \n(BEAT) I dropped him, turned around and saw her lying on the floor and called her name. She looked up at me.. \n(BEAT) .and the next thing I knew, I was flying.. A loud roar of fire and crushing timbers.. \n", "test3_id": 923}

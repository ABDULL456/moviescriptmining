{"train": "GET LOW \nWritten by \nChris Provenzano, Scott Seeke & C. Gaby Mitchell \n1 EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT 1 \nFrom a distance and through the trees we see a raging hell fire engulfing a small two story house. It burns and burns. Out of nowhere a man bursts through a second story window, lands hard and rolls to smother his burning clothes. He crawls away and staggers up and for a moment looks as if he might run back into the flames. But the heat is unbearable. He runs toward us then past us through black shadows. We cannot see his face, \n1A EXT. WINDOW - EARLY MORNING (WINTER 1930S) 1A \nGlass in a weathered window glitters with early morning sun. A rock shatters one of the remaining glass panes! \n2 EXT. YARD - EARLY MORNING/CONTINUOUS 2 \nThe rock thrower, TOM ( 10) is hightailing it away from an isolated Appalachian SHACK as the door bangs open, a shotgun barrel appears, and a chicken comes SQUAWKING out from under the porch! Thinking he's sure to be shot, Tom runs into the old barn! \n3 INT. BUSH'S BARN - EARLY MORNING/CONTINUOUS 3 \nPanting in terror, Tom is hunkered down in strips of light, trying to see through the cracks. There is a loud SNORT and the huge face of some kind of beast suddenly appears at his shoulder. Tom jumps, panicked, just as a SHADOWY FIGURE creeps into the barn and levels a glinting shotgun at him! Tom freezes, bends over, and throws up! When Tom looks up, a ray of light reveals the half face of a fierce gray bearded man, FELIX BUSH. He is holding out a handkerchief to the boy. Shaking hard, Tom hesitates then takes it and wipes his mouth. Bush pushes open the door and gives Tom a sad look that the boy will never forget before waving him away. \n4 EXT. BUSH'S BARN - MORNING 4 \nLooking back over his shoulder, Tom runs for the road. Two of his BUDDIES are already kicking up dust. BUSH (72) steps into the sun and watches the boy run off with a look of muted anger, sadness, and something much deeper. \n5 INT. BUSH'S BARN - DAY 5 \nBush enters the barn to check on his companion. MULE is older than Bush in mule years and just as gray. He wears an old mule blanket everywhere to keep out the cold. He fidgets nervously from all the excitement. Bush comforts him. \nBUS H Just a boy, that's all. \n6 SERIES: 6 7 Bush rips down an old faded sign at the road and posts a 7 fresh one:'No Damn Trespassing/Beware of Mule'. Bush checks the road in both directions. All clear for now. 8 Bush splits firewood with powerful cleaving strokes. Mule 8 dozes in the shade. Bush sees a Model-T approach and turn into his road, right past his new sign. He glances at his shotgun leaning against the shack. The Model-T comes to a shaky stop. A MAN climbs out, sees Bush swinging the axe and approaches with trepidation. \nHORTON Mornin', sir. \nBUSH Hard life if you can't read.. \nHORTON Pardon? I'm uh, Reverend Gus Horton, sir, how you doing? Bush stops his swing and turns and stares coldly at Horton. \nBUSH Don't need saving, preacher. \nHORTON Uh, well, Mr. Wiley Starke has passed on, sir. His funeral is tomorrow and I thought you might want to know since.. \nBUSH \n(SOFTLY) What got him? \nHORTON Just got old, sir. \nBUSH Yeah, well.. Bush returns to chopping wood. Feeling awkward, Horton hesitates, starts for his car, stops. \nHORTON Mr. Starke told me that you and him ran away from home when you were 6 years old. Is that true? \nBUSH I talked him into it. Bush doesn't turn, just keeps chopping. \nHORTON Well.. anyway.. I.. alright.. Horton shrugs, get in his car, and leaves. Bush strikes the log hard and a cleaved piece goes flying. \nBUSH Bout time for me to get low. \nHORTON Get what? \nBUSH Down to business Bush reaches into his overalls and puts a balled-up wad of MONEY on the pew. Horton's eyes bulge. \nBUSH Need a funeral. Horton looks up from the money. \nHORTON For who? \nBUSH Me. Buddy peers around from the vestibule, listening, curious as hell, until Kathryn pulls him back. \nHORTON For you? (off Bush's impatient nod) You want to buy a funeral for you? \nBUSH Am I not talking right? \nHORTON No, yes, I'm sorry. Are you sick sir? \nBUSH Everybody dies. \nHORTON True, but.. \nBUSH I don't take care of my bones it won't get done, will it? \nHORTON All right, I see. Well the church can help you get your affairs in order, arrange a service.. Horton glances at the strange wad of money again. \nBUSH What would you say? \nHORTON About what? \nBUS H Me. \nHORTON A eulogy? I.. don't know. What do you want me to say? \nBUSH Say what you'd say right now to my face. \nHORTON Well. I uh, I don't know much about you, Mr. Bush. I mean, I've heard stories but.. \nBUSH What stories? Bush leans in and stares into Horton. It feels like everything in the world stops dead. Buddy peeks in again, this time Kathryn peeks too. \nHORTON Just stories.. (off Bush's intense look) .you know, people talking. \nBUSH What kind of stories? Say one. \nHORTON Sir.. my mother used to say that gossip is the devil's radio.. \n(UNFORTUNATE ASIDE) .not that she didn't play that radio at full volume now and then, bless her heart, but.. (back to business) .what matters when you come to the end of your life is that you're ready for the next one. Have you made peace with God, sir? \nBUS H I paid. Horton has no idea what Bush means. He looks at the money, back at Bush. \nHORTON Well.. you can't buy forgiveness, Mr. Bush. It's free. But you do have to ask for it. \nBUSH Nothing in this world is free, preacher. \nBush abruptly grabs his money and starts out. His hand bangs into the pew and the money FALLS. Buddy stares wild-eyed at the big wad of money then drops back into the vestibule. Bush storms past Buddy, Kathryn and the baby like a hot wind. \n20A EXT. CHURCH - DAY 20A \n(DISTANTLY HOPEFUL) Is there a body? \nBUDDY No, the old man did the beating. Never seen anything like it. \nFRANK Social event of the year and I missed it. Frank lowers the paper so just his eyes appear. He has no southern accent and doesn't look small town. \nFRANK Read the paper today? (off Buddy's no) Something strange is happening in the world right now. \nBUDDY What? \nFRANK People are dying in bunches. (off Buddy's look) Everywhere. But here. He puts the paper down and studies his socks. \nFRANK I wonder what the odds are of a funeral home going broke? I mean you have a business everybody on earth needs, you can't make that work, it's got to be you right? And yet.. I don't know.. what do you do when people won't die? \nBUDDY Well.. \nFRANK Onethingabout Chicago, people knowhowto die; they drown, get runover,shot, whatever it takes. \nBUDDY We get it done down here, we're just not in a hurry about it. \nFRANK It's them or us. Frank sighs and stares forlornly out at a casket. \nBUDDY \n(QUIETLY) I might know someone who is looking for a funeral. Frank's eyes crawl over to him. \n25 OMITTED 25 \n30 EXT./INT. FRONTAGE ROAD/FRANK'S CAR - DAY 30 \nThe Quinn Funeral Home Packard Hearse makes it way down the road. Frank drives as Buddy searches ahead. \nFRANK How much did he have? \nBUDDY It was all wadded up. \nFRANK Ooo, hermit money. That's good. Buddy sees Bush's signs. \nBUDDY There it is.. \n31 INT/EXT. FRANK'S CAR/FRONTAGE ROAD - DAY 31 \nThey stop at Bush's sign: 'No Damn Trespassing.\" Frank squints up at the old shack and doesn't like what he sees at all. Buddy opens his door but Frank doesn't. \nBUDDY What are you doing? \nFRANK You've been wanting a shot at sales.. \nBUDDY But.. \nFRANK As of right now, you're on commission. (off Buddy's look) Remember; foot in the door, establish trust, and drop the hammer. Buddy hesitates, crawls out, and eyes the shack. \nBUDDY I'd feel better if you'd go too. \nFRANK No doubt but if you don't do this by yourself, you won't know if you're any good. And you'll never be any good if you don't know you are. Go get him! \n32 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 32 \nBUDDY There's two sides to every story. As Bush puts some rabbit on Buddy's old yellowed plate.. \nBUSH People say that. But they don't mean it. They think what they think and they don't want to know anything else. \nBUDDY Yes, sir, but I think people are so scared of what they don't know that they make things up to feel better about it. \nBUSH Like life after dying. Heaven. \nBUDDY \n(THINKS) I hope that part's true, don't you? \n(BEAT) But I don't think we know the actual truth about much of anything. I know I don't. I'm just guessing most of the time. Bush gives Buddy a closer look and motions for him to try the rabbit. Fearing the worst, Buddy bends into the steam, takes a cautious bites and mutters with shocked surprise.. \nBUDDY Lord, that's good.. \nBUS H You boys been coming out here to throw rocks through my window for 20-30 years. \nBUDDY I never.. \nBUSH Ya'll know lots of stories about me? \nBUDDY \n(SQUIRMS) Yes, sir, I guess, but.. \nBUSH Tell one. \nBUDDY I'd rather not. Bush eases forward, his eyes slit. The old Bush is back. \nBUSH I rather you did. \nBUDDY (startled/leans back) Well. When I was kid I heard you killed some men in a fist fight. \nBUSH Is that all? Bush leans back stone-faced. In the silence, Buddy looks over again at the wondrous carving of the mule on the window sill, at the big ears and long face that are being born from the rough block. It makes him smile. But when he glances back, Bush is staring a hole through him. \nBUS H What's your name again? \nBUDDY Buddy Robinson, sir. \nBUS H Well, if I need you -- I know where you are. It sounds almost like a threat. It shorts Buddy out. He stops eating and realizes that Bush has taken another turn and that he's been dismissed. \n34 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 34 \nBuddy heads to the hearse, glancing back over his shoulder. As he recalls his encounter, he stops, looking back at the shack. The old legend has gotten deep under his skin. \n35 OMITTED 35 \n35A EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD 35A \nThe morning sun breaks over the mountains. \n36 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - MORNING 36 \nBush is on the porch, straining boiled herbs, grass, and bark into a jar. There is something not right with him and he knows it. While the medicine cools he looks out across the mountain and draws a deep breath. \n37 EXT. FUNERAL HOME - MORNING 37 \nFRANK Whatever you want, flowers.. \nBUSH No. \nFRANK Burial plot.. \nBUSH Got it. \nFRANK A service? \nBUSH Party. \nFRANK A what? \nBUSH A party. \nBUDDY What kind of party? \nBUSH Funeral party. Stumped for once in his life, Frank looks at Buddy. Then years of honed instincts surge back to life. \nFRANK We can do that. \n42 INT. FUNERAL HOME/OFFICE - DAY 42 \nAs they come back into the office.. \nBUSH And I want to be there. Frank goes behind his desk. Buddy and Bush start to sit.. \nFRANK You will be, I guarantee it. \nBUSH I want to be there now. \nBUDDY You want to be at your funeral.. party.. alive? (off Bush's nod) But.. it's not a funeral if you're not, you know, deceased.. \nFRANK Hold on now, it's a detail, we can look at it. \nBUDDY Pretty big detail. \nFrank cuts Buddy a look then smiles at Bush. \nFRANK So you'd like to have a funeral party while you're alive so you can go? \nBUSH Yes or no? \nFRANK Yes. Buddy is lost. \nFRANK Buddy, get some paper. We need to make of list of who Mr. Bush wants to invite.. As Buddy starts to get up. \nBUSH Sit down. Buddy sits right down. \nBUSH I want everybody to come who's got a story to tell about me. \nFRANK Say again. \nBUDDY That probably covers 4 counties.. Bush shoots him a look. Frank shoots him a look. Buddy thinks about how great an outdoor life would be. \nBUSH Then I want 4 counties worth of people at the party. \nKATHRYN Get out of here. \nMATTIE He was. And I don't mean just the way he looked. \nKATHRYN I hope not. \nMATTIE Oh no, listen, he was beautiful. \nKATHRYN Are you serious? \nMATTIE \n(SIGHS/THINKS) Most people are just laid out nice and simple, you know? You always know what they're thinking and where you are with them. But he was this.. big old cave that went deeper and deeper. You'd never get to the end of him. \nKATHRYN Good Lord, you had a crush on him! \nMATTIE All the girls did. I know he's something wild that crawls out of the hills once in a while and gets into trouble now but there's still nobody like him. \n46 EXT. BUSH'S BARN - MORNING 46 \nBush comes out of the barn. Frank and Buddy are there. \nFRANK We have a plan. All we need is a little bit of your time. \nBUSH What for? \nBUDDY Seeing it is better than hearing about it. Bush looks at the hearse, back at Buddy and Frank. \nBUSH How much is it gonna cost? \nFRANK \n(TO BUDDY) Did you say anything about money? (touches his own chest) I didn't say anything about money. \n(TO BUSH) If we can't get you what you want you don't owe us anything. \n47 INT. HEARSE - DAY 47 \nFrank, Buddy, and Bush ride in the front seat of the hearse. They are together but in very different worlds. They don't even look at each other when they talk. Buddy is lost in serious thought. Frank is preoccupied about the deal and driving too fast. Bush is scrunched up to the door. He is going much faster than he is used to going. He kinda likes it and kinda doesn't. \nBUSH It moves, don't it? \nFRANK \n(DISTRACTED) This is nothing. \nBUSH Fancy car for the dead. \nFRANK Didn't buy it for them. \nBUDDY (out of nowhere) We say that funerals are \"For the Living\" but we forget what that means sometimes, I guess. (to Bush but almost to \nHIMSELF) I was thinking about your funeral party before I went to sleep last night and I think I understand it a little now. When I was a kid, my folks where killed in a bad car wreck and the people at the funeral home... they did the impossible as far as I was concerned. I don't know what I would've done without them. And I remember wishing that my mother and daddy were there to see how beautiful they made everything. Frank is hearing this for the first time and is shocked. Bush glances softly at Buddy then looks out the side window at the world rushing by too fast. All at once he gives in to it. \n48 EXT. TOWN STREET - DAY 48 \nThe hearse pulls up on main street. Frank, Buddy, and Bush get out and head toward Feldman's Clothing Store. \nHORTON Amen. \nFRANK Let's play some cards. \nRAY Oh for God's sake, face it Frank, you're broke. This is not about cards. It's a declaration meant to embarrass Frank in front of everyone. Frank feels their eyes on him as he starts to pull off his watch. Ray waves it off. \nRAY Please. I've won that 4 times already. \nFRANK It's who has it last that counts. \nCARL Say what you want but if there hadn't been anybody there the other day he would've killed me. And I guarantee you it wouldn't have been his first time. It sounds true and everyone is quiet except Mattie. \nMATTIE Everybody knows you started it. (off his glare) Don't look at me like that. I remember when you were born. You were the sweetest little boy. What is wrong with you? Momentarily shamed, Carl's face softens and we can see a better man there. He struggles to hold on to it but.. \nCARL I made a mistake. But there's a line.. and he crossed it.. and everybody knows that too. Ya'll go on and have a party with the devil for his money but I'll dance on his grave someday. Carl snatches his few dollars up and heads out. \nHORTON You kind of hate to admit it when it comes to Carl but he's got a point. You don't know what Bush is doing. What if he just wants to get everybody in one place so he can turn his shotgun on them? \nMATTIE He wouldn't.. \nHORTON I looked in his eyes. The truth is nobody knows what he's capable of. Maybe even he doesn't know. She looks into him. Frank starts to deal the cards. \nRAY Go ahead and lay your watch down, Frank. But I am going to keep it this time, alright, on principle. \nFRANK I got an idea. Let's try something different. \n(TO RAY) The cards in your sock? Leave'em there. Everyone freezes. Ray shakes his head. \nRAY What are you trying to pull now? \nFRANK You really think you're that good that nobody sees? \nRAY Sees what? \nFRANK You cheat at everything you do. Even at the bank, you loan people just enough to get'em deeper in so you can foreclose on them. \nRAY You are a pathetic man. And a goddamn.. \nFRANK Am I? Then stand up and roll down your socks. (a deep dark look) Stand up or I'll stand you up. Ray looks around the table and suddenly realizes that he is irreversibly exposed and alone. The sound of Frank's chair scraping the floor makes him jerk up. \nHe walks out, trying to find his old confident rhythm and failing. Everyone sits in uneasy silence. \n58 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 58 \nHorton waves and walks out, leaving the door open. Frank walks Mattie to the door, helping with her coat, trying to work up his nerve to say.. \nFRANK I'll walk you home. \nMATTIE No. Thank you. \nFRANK \n(HURT) You sure? (off her firm nod) You're not going to play anymore, are you? \nMATTIE Oh, I don't know. Thank you for inviting me though. \nFRANK I'm sorry about the..we don't always fight, okay, we do, but he's had that coming for.. \nANNOUNCER Okay. Now I have to say that you don't look quite like you do on the posters. \nBUSH I got pruned. \nANNOUNCER Well, you're a bit of a local legend, sir. I was a little nervous about our interview. I've heard some pretty wild stories.. \nBUSH Like what? \nANNOUNCER Well uh, just.. from what I understand, you want everyone who has a story about you to come and tell it. Is that right? \nBUSH You come and tell yours. \nANNOUNCER Thank you. Now how long have you been living out there by yourself? \n64 INT. MATTIE DARROW HOUSE - NIGHT/CONTINUOUS 64 \nMattie is cutting the stems of some lovely yellow flowers and arranging them in a vase. \nBUSH (O.S.) 40 some years. \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) 40 years with nobody to talk to? \nBUSH (O.S.) First 38 are the hardest. \nMattie grins. \n65 INT. WCGM - CONTINUOUS 65 \nANNOUNCER But why would you do that, Mr. Bush, shut yourself off like that? Frank isn't happy with this but Buddy wants to hear. \nBUSH Come to the funeral and maybe you'll find out. \nANNOUNCER You heard it here on WCGM, folks, find out the answer to the mystery February 16.. \nBUSH One more thing, boy. FRANK and Buddy tense. What's this? \n66 INT. DARROW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 6 6 \nMattie tenses at the sound in Bush's voice. \nBUSH (O.S.) Gonna be a drawing. \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) What kind of drawing, sir? \nBUSH You buy a ticket for $5.00 The day of the funeral we draw names. Then when I die, the winner gets my place, 300 acres of timber that hasn't been touched in 40 years. Mattie accidentally cuts a bloom off of a flower. \n67 INT. WCGM - SAME 67 \nDead air. The kid, Frank, and Buddy are all staring at Bush. \nANNOUNCER For 5 dollars? \nBUSH Send it to the Quinn Funeral Home. Frank's eyes light up like fiery pinwheels and he almost yelps! Buddy looks oddly perplexed and sad. \nANNOUNCER You heard him! If you want a chance to win 300 acres of virgin timber worth thousands and thousands of dollars, send 5 dollars along with your name and address to.. (off Frank waving and pointing to himself) Frank Quinn at Quinn Funeral Home. As the Announcer begins a song, Bush moves his head in time with the music. Frank and Buddy rush into the control booth. \nFRANK \n72 EXT. BUSH'S LAND - DAY/LATER 72 \nMattie and Bush walks side by side through the last of the glimmering light and shadows beneath the trees. It is a chilly and Mattie's cheeks are flushed. She is enchanted by the place. Bush tries to hide how winded he is.. \nMATTIE It really is beautiful. Probably looked like this everywhere a hundred years ago. \nBUSH You leave things alone, they know what to do. \nMATTIE Like you? \nBUSH No, Ma'am. I don't know what to do about anything much. \nMATTIE You've been alone a long time. \nBUSH Some people are more suited to it than others, I reckon. \n46A. \nMATTIE That's funny cause I never thought that it'd suit you. I knew you wouldn't be like anybody else but.. no one to talk to, no one to.. be with.. never. He looks into her then looks away at something. \nBUSH How you sleeping these days, girl? \nMATTIE How am I what? \nBUSH You sleep good? \nMATTIE No, not lately. How'd you know? He veers off the path and pulls up a plant and brings it back to her. \nBUSH Chamomile, it's good when the nights get long. Helps you nod off. She takes it and smiles up at him. \nBUSH Want to go on a ways? \nMATTIE Yes. \nBUSH Would you stay for supper? \nMATTIE I don't want to be any trouble. \nBUSH A supper guest every 30-40 years is not much trouble, Girl. \nMATTIE Alright then. He holds out his arm. \nBUSH Better stay close, some big old wild cats been eating my chickens.. She looks around and takes his arm. \nBUSH .or maybe it was me.. She snorts and slaps his arm but doesn't let go.. \n73 OMITTED 73 \n74 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - NIGHT 74 \nThey enter the dark room together. Bush lights a lantern, gets a chair from a corner and holds it out for her. She sits and watches him check a cast iron pot on the warm stove and put a log on the fire. She notices the beautiful table. \nMATTIE You always were good with your hands. He puts a glass of tea in front of her and sits down. \nBUSH You still play the piano? \nMATTIE I teach a few girls. \n86 INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 86 \nFrank is hopelessly lost in a sea of envelopes. The phone is ringing off the hook, there are full sacks around him, and some Reporter is trying to take a picture through the front window. Frank scowls and lowers the blinds. \n87 EXT. MATTIE'S HOUSE - DAY 87 \nFrank is at Mattie's door entranced by the troubled but beautiful piano music coming from inside. It stops abruptly when he knocks. In seconds, Mattie appears. \nFRANK Hey Mattie. He looks almost boyish and bashful as he drinks her in. \nFRANK Was that you? It was really.. \nMATTIE This is a surprise. \nFRANK Yeah, sorry. He stands, loving the view, forgetting why he is here. She waits it out as long as she can, not sure how she feels about this adoring look. \nMATTIE Was there something you..? \nFRANK Uh, yeah.. Help! \nMATTIE What? \nFRANK I'm up to my ears with this funeral and I thought, you know, we haven't had time to talk much lately so maybe you'd like to come over and rip open envelopes with me and \nMATTIE I'm sorry, I have lessons all afternoon. I have to get back in. \nFRANK Oh, okay, I just.. \nMATTIE Sorry. She slips back inside. Frank stares at the door. \n88 INT. MATTIE`S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 88 \nMattie leans against the door with her eyes closed. There is no student at the piano. \n89 OMITTED 89/90 89 \n91 EXT. CHURCH/SOUTHERN ILLINOIS - AFTERNOON 91 \nThe hearse is parked in front of a beautiful white board church. \n91A INT. HEARSE - AFTERNOON 91A \nClose on Bush and Buddy. \nBUSH Don't say nothing. \nBUDDY To who? \nBUSH You can say \"hi\". Bush gets out. Buddy sighs, mimes \"Hi\" and gets out. \n92 INT. ILLINOIS CHURCH ENTRY - AFTERNOON 92 \nBuddy quietly creeps in through the front door, looks back over his shoulder, scowls, and enters the church. 93 He stops and looks around, awed by the beautifully serene 93 sanctuary. Now he sees a tall BLACK MAN (70) come out of an office door behind the pulpit, walk up the aisle, glancing out the window at the driveway, and then at Buddy. \nBUDDY Hi. \nCHARLIE Hello. Buddy is out of words that he is allowed to say. He glances at the door but Bush is not coming in. \nCHARLIE Don't you dare.. \nBUSH I built my own jail and put myself in it! And I stayed in it for 40 goddamn years! No wife, no kids, no friends! That's not enough? \nCHARLIE You know it isn't. \nBUSH (tears welling up) Well. Why don't you come and say that then, Charlie? Hell, say it all! I don't care. \nCHARLIE Not on your life. The air is so heavy you can't breathe it. Bush suddenly gets up and leaves. Buddy starts to follow. Charlie puts his hand on him to stay. They sit in silence a moment. \nCHARLIE How much do you know about him? \nBUDDY Almost nothing, sir. I just work at the funeral home. \nCHARLIE Do you know he built this church? \nBUDDY No?! \n(LOOKING AROUND) How's a man like him make something like this? I mean, I know he's a good carpenter but this is.. \nCHARLIE Magic? (off Buddy's look) Maybe it's the best of him, maybe he put his soul into it, I don't know. \nBUDDY What ya'll were talking about.. what did he do? Who was he supposed to tell? \nCHARLIE \n(THINKS) For him and God to know I guess. I wish I'd never been put between them, that's for sure. \n(BEAT) I will tell you that he showed up here half dead. I had just started preaching. Over the next 4 years we built this. \nBUDDY Are you coming to the funeral? Charlie sighs and looks around. 94A Omitted 94A \n95 INT. HEARSE/MOVING/PMP - NIGHT 95 \nBuddy and Bush are both lost in thought. Finally.. \nBUDDY Can I ask you something? \nBUSH Do you have to? \nBUDDY Yes. What are we doing? Since the day you came into the funeral home, I don't think anything has happened that you didn't want to happen. I just don't know where it's going. \nBUSH There's a whole lot of things that you don't know. Like what a dog dreams. You can make up a story about him chasing rabbits but you don't know if there's rabbits in there or not. And he can't tell you, can he? \nBUDDY Not unless he's a very special dog. They snort together. \nBUSH People don't say what they mean either so you don't really know any more about them then you do about that dog's dream. \nBUDDY But what..? \nBUSH \n(LOOKING AWAY) That time you left my house I saw you stop and look back. You wanted to know what could make somebody like me. (off Buddy's uneasy look) Well here you are, son, here you are. \n96 INT. FUNERAL HOME - EVENING 9 6 \nFrank is putting money into a casket. He checks his watch. \nFRANK The cut's not bad but how's the head? He moves his finger across Buddy's eyes. \nFRANK Follow it. He looks him over carefully. He's had experience. \nFRANK Dizzy? Double vision? Nauseous? (off Buddy's no) You'll be okay. Did you see who it was? \nBUDDY No. I was putting the money in.. heard glass breaking.. locked up the casket quick and.. boom.. \nFRANK You did good. \nBUDDY Doesn't feel good. \n108 INT. DARROW HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - LATER 108 \nMattie sits beside a fire, knitting a baby blanket by an oil lamp. All at once the lights sputter on, the radio lights up, warms, and begins to PLAY, as a KNOCK at the door.. \n109 INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR/DARROW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 109 \nMattie pulls the door open. Bush is standing there soaking wet, breathing hard, holding his shotgun. She draws back reflexively. He looks into her. \nBUSH Please, Ma'am. \n110 INT. DARROW HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT 110 \nBush stands with a towel around him, shivering. Mattie opens a dresser drawer. Inside the drawer, is the carefully arranged tableau of a watch, a ring, a stethoscope, and some clothes. She hates to disturb the drawer but pulls out a pair of black pants and a white shirt, lays them on the bed, and walks out. \n111 INT. DARROW HOME/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 111 \nMattie steps from the kitchen with a steaming mug as Bush comes down the stairs in clothes that are too loose. Still shivering, Bush steps uneasily in front of the fire. Mattie hands him the hot mug. He looks uneasily at the yellow flowers on the table nearby. \nBUSH Thank you. \nMATTIE What are you doing here? Burned through, a log falls in the fire. Bush jerks oddly and moves away. \nBUSH Can I sit a minute? She stares at him then nods at a chair. She keeps standing behind the other chair. He bends over the mug and seems to lock up inside. \nBUSH You want to know why I have your sister's picture on my wall? \nMATTIE I'm not stupid, Felix. No, I take that back. How long was it going on? She was already married when I met you. Were you just making up to me to get to her? Bush is so still he looks like a gargoyle. \nMATTIE If you're not going to talk, leave. \nBUSH Can you help who you love? Mattie's face tells us that she has asked herself that question many times. \nBUSH I've had 40 years to think about it and I still don't know. \nMATTIE I don't know either, so.. Slowly the gargoyle unfolds. His eyes drill into her. \nBUSH I want to tell you how it was. If you don't want me to, I'll go. Mattie sighs from down deep in her shoes then comes around and sits down. \nMATTIE Don't lie to me. When did you take up with her? \nBUSH I came to see you and she was there, hanging clothes on the line with your mama. Bush stares out the window so hard, Mattie turns to see what he is looking at.. \nBUSH She turned around.. (as Mattie turns back) .and.. I promise you that I did not know that I had a heart till right then. \nTears well up in Mattie's eyes. \nFRANK Well, think about it, we could.. \nBUSH Don't know that I'm doing it. \nFRANK What?! \nBUSH Thinking to call it off. \nFRANK You can't! \nBUSH Damn well can if I want to. \nFRANK No no no, it's in motion! \nBUSH If I say no, it's no. Send the money back. \nFRANK You're killing me! I bought things, hired people.. promised money, everybody in town is hoping to.. \nBUSH I care about this town as much as they care about me. \nFRANK It's what you said you wanted and I've busted my ass for you. So why don't you want it anymore? You owe me that. \nBUSH \n(LONG BEAT) It was the end of the line, tell it all, get out of jail party. But I guess I ain't got the goddamn guts to open my own mouth and I can't get nobody to talk for me so the hell with it. And to hell with me. Bush grabs his shotgun and goes. Frank sits, stunned. \n115 INT. BUDDY'S HOUSE-EARLY MORNING 115 \nBuddy sits at the breakfast table, holding his son. He opens and closes his eyes, checking out his vision. Kathryn, at the stove, sees him out of the corner of her eye. \nKATHRYN Are you having trouble seeing? \nBUDDY I see you're mad. \nKATHRYN I'm not mad. I'm concerned She shoves the skillet off the burner and comes to him. \nBUDDY \n(SQUINTS UP) No, you're mad. She tenderly touches his head. \nKATHRYN If I could get my hands on whoever did this, you'd see mad. \nFRANK (O.S.) Buddy! You up?! Frank rushes in, lifts a phantom hat to Kathryn, scrapes up a chair, pulls on the baby's toe, and looks at Buddy. \nFRANK Trouble. \nBUDDY What's the matter? \nFRANK Bush is pulling out. \nBUDDY What? \nFRANK What happened yesterday? \nBUDDY I told you, we went up to Illinois and met a preacher. \nFRANK But what happened? \nBUSH Well.. what do you want to do? Buddy looks back at Bush. \nBUDDY I don't.. (realizing just then) I want to make this funeral for you if you want it. \nBUSH (a long look) Hell. Do it if you can. \n(BEAT) I guess for everyone like me, there's one like you, son. I about forgot that. Buddy holds out his hand to help Bush up but Bush forces himself up on his own and walks out. \n129 OMITTED 129 \n130 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE/SOUTHERN ILLINOIS - EVENING 130 \nCharlie sits at his desk, staring blankly at his crooked stamp. Suddenly Fate in the form of Frank Quinn looms at the window. Charlie knows he is there but he won't look at him. \n131 INT. BUDDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM- DAWN 131 \nBuddy, Kathryn, and the baby are sleeping soundly. There is a SCRATCHING NOISE. Buddy sits up, grabs a baseball bat and falls back asleep. The scratching starts again. He opens his eyes, surprised to see the bat in his hand. He hears the scratching. He looks around, sees something at the window. He slides to the floor, crawls on his knees, and looks out. Frank is standing there, scratching on the screen. Behind him is Charlie, looking very unhappy about standing in the near dark in a small southern town, scratching on a screen. Buddy realizes what he is seeing and starts to smile. \n132 EXT. BUDDY'S HOUSE - DAWN 132 \nFrank, Buddy, and Charlie are on the porch, watching the world come to life. Charlie looks as if he is hoping for some kind of sign from above. \nBUDDY I'm glad you decided to come, sir. \nCHARLIE Free will is not all that it's cracked up to be. \nBUDDY \n(AT FRANK) Did you take the money out of the casket? \nFRANK Yeah. \nBUDDY Why didn't you tell me?! \nFRANK I forgot. \nBUDDY You forgot?! Where is it? \nFRANK In the hearse, under the floorboards. Charlie remembers that Frank said he wasn't coming back and gives him a look. Buddy is giving Frank the same look. \nFRANK What? Nobody steals a hearse. Now all we got to do is take the Reverend here to Bush and.. \nBUDDY I forgot to tell you, Mr. Bush already said he would do it. \nFRANK You're shittin' me?! Charlie gets up and starts walking away.. \nCHARLIE Where can I catch a train? \nFRANK You can't leave you just got here. \nCHARLIE Watch and learn. \nFRANK Hold on.. \nCHARLIE Where's the station? \n133 EXT - BUSH'S LAND/ROAD - MORNING 133 A tractor pulling a trailer with a big old honking generator on it, a truck loaded with equipment and workers for the big event rumbles down a dirt road. The Quinn Funeral home hearse completes the unlikely parade. \n143 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 143 \nThe generator is working! And standing on the flat bed truck, which is now a stage, an ANNOUNCER introduces a hot blue grass group The crowd is huge now and listens as the group kicks off a song. Behind the stage Frank is collecting money from the boys who are selling the raffle tickets, making them turn their pockets inside out. The generator makes a strange noise, Frank eyeballs it, and it labors on. Buddy walks up, nudges Frank, and nods out at the huge crowd. Can you believe this?! Charlie walks up and says something that we cannot hear. \n144 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 144 \nPacing the cage, Bush peeks out the window. \nBUSH You asked for it you old ornery sonofabitch, now what are you gonna do? \n145 INT. BUSH'S BARN - DAY 145 \nFrank, Buddy, and Charlie enter the barn and see Mule hitched to the wagon. On the back of the wagon is a simple and rustically elegant casket with the initials FB carved into the center board. It sobers them all. \n146 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/GULLY - DAY 146 \nCarl, Gary, and Theman hide and watch Frank, Buddy and Charlie walk Mule and the wagon away from the barn and down the road. Carl eyes Bush's shack and starts for it. \nGARY Hey, hey, where you going? He said the woods.. \nCARL Closer. \nAnd he takes off. \nTHEMAN He's crazy! \n147 OMITTED 147 \n148 OMIT 148 \n149 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 149 \nThe bluegrass fiddle player nods to the others to quickly end the song. Now we see why. Frank, Buddy, and Charlie have brought the wagon with the coffin into the field. Everyone quiets, remembering why they are here. They park the wagon behind the hearse. Frank and Charlie walk toward the stage. Buddy peels away. Frank calls after him to come with them to the stage but Buddy waves them away. He wants no part of that. He sees Kathryn and Horton threading their way through the crowd and moves toward them instead. Frank and Charlie climb the makeshift stairs up to the stage. Charlie sits down on a folding chair while Frank goes to the big microphone and stares with satisfaction at the huge Depression-era Woodstock crowd. \nFRANK Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I'm Frank Quinn of Quinn Funeral Home. Welcome to the live funeral party of Mr. Felix Bush! People don't know whether to clap or not. Some do and the rest of them pick it up. Buddy gets to Kathryn and hugs her and the baby. \nBUDDY Where's Mattie? \nKATHRYN She wouldn't come. I don't.. \nFRANK I've done some things in my life, but never this. Bet you haven't either, bet no one has. \n(MORE) \nFRANK (CONT'D) (winks back at Charlie) We try to make things predictable and safe but if we don't risk everything to get what we want, we don't want it enough. \n150 OMIT 150 \n151 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - CONTINUOUS 151 \nFrank finds Buddy in the crowd. \nFRANK The person who made all of this happen for us doesn't like the spotlight but Buddy Robinson is the heart of Quinn Funeral Home and I'm proud to know him. Buddy is embarrassed and moved. Kathryn's eyes soften. \n152 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 152 \nCarl is sloshing gasoline onto the back porch while Gary and Theman keep nervous watch at the farendof porch. Suddenly Carl feels a shotgun's cold metal on his neck and the 45 being ripped from his belt and thrown to the ground. \nBUSH Close the door. Charlie slams the door. Frank examines the wound. Buddy stares in shock at the old roping burns scars on Bush's chest. \nFRANK Missed the bone. Got any alcohol and clean rags? Bush nods at the cabinet. Charlie finds an amazing assortment of herbs and roots, alcohol and old sheets ripped into rags. \nBUDDY Why don't you sit down, sir? \nBUSH Boil some water and I'll tell you how to make me a poultice. Frank takes the rags and alcohol from Charlie \nFRANK This is gonna hurt. \nBUSH Don't sugar coat it. \n155 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 155 \nEveryone is standing around in shock. \n156 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 156 \nKathryn waits anxiously near the porch with the baby. \n157 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 157 \nHorton steps up to the microphone. The shocked crowd turns to him. He closes his eyes and bows his head. \nREVEREND HORTON Lord, you say you move in mysterious ways and we believe you because we don't understand much of anything. And so we come to you today not seeking answers to what's happened here but asking you to help us open our hearts a little more to each other and find some forgiveness and understanding. \n158 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 158 \nFrank has cleaned the wound. Buddy has made a poultice that Bush is pressing onto the wound as he hears the last of Horton's prayer over the loudspeakers. \nBUS H Pretty good prayer. Mighta been wrong about that preacher. \nCHARLIE Why don't you lay down, Felix? \nBush thinks about it, sees a way out. For a second he looks like he might take it. Then he shakes his head, puts a rag over the poultice and pulls his shirt up. \nBUSH Let's go 'fore I lose my nerve. \nBUDDY Are you sure? Bush scowls at the huge blood stain on his shirt. He looks at Frank's white shirt. Frank just stares at him. Bush keeps looking. Finally Frank sighs and starts loosening his tie. \n159 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 159 \nThe bluegrass band sings a good hymn. The crowd is still stunned and talking, not knowing what to do. \n160 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 160 \nBuddy gently helps Bush into his jacket, which has a bullet tear in it along the shoulder but Bush seems okay with it, to Frank's relief. Frank is putting on an old faded shirt of Bush's. As Bush starts for the door, he comes up beside Charlie. \nBUSH You ain't nervous? All them white folks out there? \nCHARLIE There's white folks here?! \nBUSH Stick with me, you'll be all right. \nCHARLIE You're the one they're shooting at. As Charlie opens the door, Bush stops, all his misgivings flooding in with the light. He looks at Buddy. \nBUSH Pretty interesting day so far, huh boy? Bush straightens himself up and goes out the door. \n163 EXT. BURNING HOUSE - NIGHT 163 \nA man on fire bursts through the second story window of a burning house. He lands hard and rolls across the yard to smother the flames. With his clothes still smoking, he unbelievably tries to run back into the hell. But the fire is too hot and he cannot. He screams like a mad man and runs into the trees.. \n164 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 164 \nThe crowd is motionless. Nothing is moving. It is as if the whole world has stopped. Frank, Buddy, and Kathryn are frozen. Bush and Mattie are looking into each other, one anguished soul to another. \nBUSH I don't know how I got out the window. \n(BEAT) \n(MORE) \nBUSH (CONT'D) No matter how many times I play it in my mind, I can't remember jumping. I thought I killed him, but maybe he pushed me, I don't know... (lost as ever..) I swear to you, if I left her in there.. everything I know about myself is a lie. But that don't matter. \n(BEAT) I didn't get her out, Little Bit, I didn't. I'm sorry. \n165 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 165 \nBush sits on the edge his bed. His face is drawn and haunted. The door open and closes. He doesn't look up. Mattie sits down beside him. Tears are streaming down her face. She lays her head gently on his shoulder. \nMATTIE Oh, Felix.. He sniffs her hair and tenderly touches it. \nBUSH Wonder if her hair would be white? \n166 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - END OF DAY/MONTAGE 166 \nA MAN chooses a winning raffle ticket from a wire cage. A poor YOUNG COUPLE with SEVERAL CHILDREN win the raffle! The promise of a new and better life begins for them. The big funeral party breaks up people wind their way home. The big old honking generator coughs off. Mule is lead back to the barn. The equipment is disassembled and loaded back on the truck. The microphone stands alone on the stage. He got it said. \n167 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 167 \nBuddy, Frank, Horton, Charlie, and Kathryn and the baby wait outside, giving Bush and Mattie time. Buddy takes the baby and holds it close. \nFinally Mattie and Bush come out of the shack and walk down to the others. No one knows what to say. Finally.. \nBUDDY How you doing, sir? \nBUSH Just fair, son. \nHORTON Carl said Ray paid them to set the fire. Paid them to break into the funeral home too. \nFRANK Can't stop pulling Aces out of his ass, can he? \nHORTON Spend his money on lawyers now. You know how thrifty they are. Frank motions to Buddy and they go to Bush. Buddy is still holding the baby, Bush looks tenderly at Buddy and the baby. \nBUSH What's his name? \nBUDDY Larry, Lawrence, after my dad, sir. \nBUSH He ain't gonna throw rocks at me, is he? \nBUDDY Not if knows what's good for him. \nBUSH You boys did good. Real good. Let's settle up. \nBUDDY We don't have to do that now. You get some rest. \n", "test1_input": "Bush stands in front of a full length mirror. He has on a decent black suit, pinned to be hemmed, and a plain white shirt, open at the collar. It is a startling change. But we still can't tell what he is thinking. Buddy is staring at him with honest disbelief. Frank is quietly trying to get Mr. Feldman to lower the price for the suit. He looks over and double-takes Bush. \nFRANK Son of a bitch, it's almost worth it. \nBUSH \n(TO BUDDY) What do you think? \nBUDDY I wouldn't know you, sir. \nBUSH Maybe the Devil won't either. Might work out. \n(TO FRANK) Where's the shoes? \nFRANK Well, normally people don't wear shoes in a casket so.. (off Bush's scowl) .what are you, about a 10D? \n54 INT. FELDMAN'S CLOTHING STORE - MOMENTS LATER 54 \nBuddy stands beside Frank who is still trying to get a deal on the clothes. Bush walks up with two pairs of pants and two new shirts, puts them on the counter, gives Frank a hard look, and walks away. Frank looks down at the clothes, over at Buddy. \nFRANK Pretty optimistic taking a change of clothes to the grave. (calls over his shoulder) How you set for underwear? \nBUSH (O.S.) Don't wear none. \nFRANK One question too many. \n55 OMIT 55 \n56 INT. HEARSE - DAY 56 \nEveryone is back in the hearse. Something is eating at Frank. \nFRANK I don't mean to be nosey but uh.. how do you know Mattie? \nBUSH She's a peach. Frank and Buddy cut Bush a look. He looks ahead. \nBUSH We had a go. Frank nearly drives off the road. \n57 INT. FUNERAL HOME/ FRANK'S ROOM - NIGHT 57 \nLate night Poker. Cigarette smoke drifts into the air. Frank, Carl, Rev. Horton, Mattie, and RAY, a banker, are at the table. Ray has the untouchable presence of someone privileged which appears to be driving Frank up a tree tonight. Horton gathers up his winnings. \nHORTON \"The Lord loves a cheerful giver..\" \nMATTIE Oh please.. you think the Lord's taking sides in a poker game in a funeral home? Horton shrugs and points to the divine evidence. \nFRANK If He is, the Divine's cheating. \nRAY Exactly. \nFRANK Don't agree with me Ray, it makes me doubt myself. \nRay sighs and studies his perfectly cut nails. \nRAY I would have turned down your loan if you were my own dear mother, Frank. \nFRANK You made my point and don't even know it. \n", "test1_true": "CARL \n(TO FRANK) What were you doing with that old bastard in town today, anyway? \nRAY Oh yes. Buying him clothes, getting him a haircut..on credit. Frank shoots him a look. \nHORTON Took out ads in a bunch of papers too, something about a party? \nFRANK God, I love small towns. \nMATTIE Who are you talking about? \nRAY That hermit, what's his name.. \nFRANK (a knowing look at Mattie) \"Felix\" Bush. \nMATTIE You're giving him a party? \nFRANK A funeral party. \nMATTIE Whatever you're drinking is not being good to you at all. \nCARL What the hell is a funeral party? \nFRANK Hey, the man wants to be at his own funeral. What can I say? I'd like to be at my funeral so I could tell my ex-wife to kiss my.. \nMATTIE What makes you think she'd show up for you? \nFRANK Because, Dear, vultures are constitutionally unable to ignore the dead. Mattie grins which delights Frank, no end. Horton stops counting his money and stares at Frank. \nHORTON It's that big wad of money of his you're after. There is a crack in Ray's disinterest that he tries to hide. \nRAY What money is that? \nMATTIE Felix has money? Everyone is looking at Frank but he shuffles the cards. \nHORTON He came to see me, wanting a funeral, had a big old greasy ball of money. Talked like he thought he could buy his way to heaven with it. \nRAY \n(SERIOUSLY) How much has he got? Maybe he can. Hearing that Bush wants or needs a real funeral Mattie is suddenly truly concerned. \nMATTIE Is he sick, Gus? Horton shrugs. Frank notes the concern and doesn't like it. Carl coughs and his ribs make him break out into a sweat. \nCARL I'll tell you one damn thing, ain't nobody gonna go to a funeral for that son of a bitch. Mattie gives Carl a look \nHORTON Language.. \nFRANK They might. He's inviting everyone who has a story about him to come. You could tell about him kicking your ass, Carl. Carl looks at Frank as if he wants to cold cock him. \nRAY Old man is going to ride the Weird Train right into the ground, isn't he? \nFRANK Wouldn't you like to know what everybody says about you behind your back, Ray? (off his look) Yeah, probably not. \nHORTON I already know way more about people than I need to. \nMATTIE Or want to. \n", "test1_id": 921, "test2_input": "FRANK Every name, every dollar, is right there! \nBUSH Not what I asked. \nFRANK I've done a hell of a job for you. I don't see why.. \nBUDDY Mr. Bush, I didn't mean to imply.. \nBUSH Hush. \nFRANK I've sold horses, cars, houses, hell, pocket watches pinned to the inside of my coat. I'm not ashamed of it. I don't rob banks, don't cheat at cards, and I sleep all right the nights I sleep. What was the question..? \nBUSH They goddamn.. He nods at the money and suddenly becomes the \"other\" Bush. \nBUSH Take out for the expenses you've already had and give me the receipts. As the bills come in for things, give them to me and I'll pay them. Put this money in a box and the boy and I'll take it someplace in the morning. Whatever new comes in, keep it in the bottom of one of them ugly caskets in there 'till I come get it. After the party, name a fair price for what you've done and we'll settle up. \n(WALKING OUT) I'll be at the car. After he's gone, Frank and Buddy stare at each other. \nFRANK Is it just me or is he extremely fucking articulate when he wants to be? \nBUDDY I don't know who's selling who what anymore. \nFRANK It's not clear, is it? \nBUDDY Not only that but something feels really wrong. \nFRANK Hold on. I told you that you were working on commission.. \nBUDDY Yeah, but.. \nFRANK So whatever our end of this is, you get a piece. \nBUDDY A piece? \nFRANK Half. It could help set you up, Buddy. So whatever feels wrong is gonna feel right pretty damn quick,okay? We just have to close it out. From here on, watch me, do what I do, and we'll be fine. \nBUDDY But.. \nFRANK He wants you to go with him to take this money somewhere which means that it's you he trusts. And that's fine because I trust you too. Just don't trust him, okay? \nBUDDY I'm lost again. \nFRANK Look, that funny feeling you have.. I have it too. And it's not funny. So go along, be friendly, but that's it. \n(BEAT) There's a euphoria that comes with closing a deal, Buddy, and the bigger the deal, the higher you get. It's better than anything. \n(MORE) \nFRANK (CONT'D) But the critical time is just before it closes. It's like a witching hour and everything tries to come apart. We're not going to let that happen. \nBUDDY All right. \nFRANK Now go. (as Buddy starts out) You know.. I always wondered why you wanted to work here. I thought you could do a lot better. (off Buddy's look back) I didn't know about your folks, I'm really sorry. \nBUDDY Thank you. He goes on. Frank turns and flips through a large stack of bills, hungrily entranced. \n81 INT. BUDDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT 8 1 \n", "test2_true": "BUDDY I might have a crying fit coming on too. \nKATHRYN Is that right? \nBUDDY Feeling a little weepy. \nKATHRYN You boys.. \nBUDDY (leans against door frame) I can maybe do something really good for us, Katy. \nKATHRYN You already have. \nBUDDY I mean, money wise. \nKATHRYN About Mr. Bush? \nBUDDY Yeah. I'm getting half of whatever we make off of him. \nKATHRYN So why aren't you happy about it? \nBUDDY Didn't know I wasn't. (off her look) I was happy for a minute. And then the whole thing of making a carnival out of a person's death, I don't know if it's right. \nKATHRYN Is it what he wants? \nBUDDY He says it is. \nKATHRYN You are not responsible for what other people do, Buddy, just you. \nBUDDY You're right. You're always right. \nKATHRYN At least I am when I'm half naked. \nBUDDY Right. \n82 INT. MATTIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 82 \nA very determined little GIRL is working her way through a song on the piano that is unrecognizable in this form, even to her. Mattie sits just behind the girl with tears in her eyes, not really listening. On the table beside the piano is a stack of picture albums and old yellowed newspaper articles. \n83 EXT/INT BUSH'S SHACK/HEARSE - MORNING 83 Sitting in the hearse outside of Bush's shack, Buddy watches Bush get in the car with his shotgun. There is a big wooden box of money on the seat between them. Bush props his shotgun against it. \nBUDDY Where to, sir? \nBUSH North. \nBUDDY (starting the hearse) How far? \nBUSH Till I say, son. Buddy gives him an uneasy look and pulls off down the tree- lined path. \n84 EXT. ROAD - DAY 84 \nThe hearse slips around the narrow road that cuts through miles of farm land lying fallow in the winter. \n85 INT. HEARSE - DAY 85 \nBuddy looks out at the highway. He is driving slow. Bush is leaning against the money, thinking. \nBUDDY How much further now? Bush waves him on. Buddy scowls then decides to get serious about this. He presses on the accelerator and the hearse takes off down the highway. \n", "test2_id": 922, "test3_input": "FRANK Reverend Jackson? (Charlie looks at hearse) Frank Quinn, Quinn funeral home. \nCHARLIE How'd you find me? Frank just smiles, takes off his hat, and offers his hand. Charlie gives him a long look and reluctantly motions him in. \nFrank enters, noting the clean simple home of man with an orderly mind. Charlie motions for Frank to sit down. \nCHARLIE I was going to play some dominos this afternoon. But something told me to stay home. I should have played dominos. Is he out there? \nFRANK Bush? No, sir. \nCHARLIE You sure? \nFRANK Pretty sure. \nCHARLIE Did you check the back? Frank snorts, liking Charlie immediately. \nFRANK You told Bush that you wouldn't come to the funeral? \nCHARLIE If he got that, why are you here? \nFRANK To help you rethink it. \nCHARLIE I don't need any help. \nFRANK Have you rethought it? (off Charlie's look) So there is a need. \n(BEAT) First off, Bush doesn't know I'm here. \nCHARLIE I wouldn't be so sure about that. (off Frank's look) He's got a way of making people do what he wants them to. Frank squirms, knows it true. \nCHARLIE Is he really a hermit? Frank whistles and takes Bush's poster out of his coat. Charlie jerks at the picture of the wild man. \nFRANK He came to see me after he'd been here, wants to call the party off. \nCHARLIE I don't care. \nFRANK Said he'd meant it to be a.. end of the line, tell it all, get out of jail funeral but that he didn't have the guts to open his mouth and he couldn't get anybody to talk for him. You know anything about that part? (off Charlie's sigh) At first he said he wanted everybody to come who had a story about him. But he didn't want to hear their bullshit stories, did he? Pardon my language. He wants to tell one, doesn't he? \nCHARLIE About time. \nFRANKFRANK Whatever he did, it's been locked up in him for 40 years and he can't get it out. (off Charlie's look) I think he told you. You may be the only person he told. And now he wants you to tell it for him. \nCHARLIE Because he won't. \nFRANK Or can't. \nCHARLIE Or won't. \nFRANK Or can't. \n(BEAT) At least he wants the truth to come out, give him that. \nCHARLIE \n(LONG STARE) I'll think about it. \nFRANK Is there a boarding house around here? \n", "test3_true": "FRANK Yeah but if you're not coming, I'm not going back. I made promises I can't keep to people I care about. This falls apart they won't blame Bush. Bank will take my business.. If I'm gonna have to start over again, might as well be from here. Charlie scowls at him. \n122 INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 122 \nUsing a tool, Buddy unseals the casket to put the new money in it and discovers that the rest of the money is gone? He can't believe it. He yanks back the casket bed lining.. \n123 OMITTED 123 \n126 INT. BUSH'S BARN - DAY 126 \nBush is sanding the beautiful lid of his casket. It is leaning against the wall and sawdust is drifting down all over him. He suddenly stops, rubs the wood tenderly, muscles up the heavy top to put it on the box and staggers back. It's not the weight, something is wrong. Sweat pops out on his forehead. He forces himself to the casket and drops the top down hard, staggers back against the loft ladder, slides down to the ground, and stares at the casket. Is this it? \n127 EXT. CROSS ROADS - DAY 127 \nThe hearse sits on the side of the road. Road signs give the mileage to different destinations. \n127A INT. HEARSE - DAY 127A \nFrank is lying in the back of the hearse, his head propped up on an old suitcase. He sips from his flask and stares out the window, thinking. \n128 INT. BUSH'S BARN - LATE DAY 128 \nBush is still on the ground propped against the ladder. His eyes are closed and the fading light steals across his face that is as still as it can be. The sawdust makes him look almost wooden. A shadow crosses then comes closer. Buddy is sure he is dead but Bush's eyes open. \nBUDDY What are you doing, sir? \nBUSH Getting a suntan. Bush starts to get up then falls back against the ladder. \nBUDDY Are you stuck? \nBUSH You have no goddamn idea how right you are, son. Buddy moves to help him up but Bush waves him off. \nBUSH I'll sit here a minute. Bush looks at the butterfly bandage on Buddy's head. \nBUSH We're a pair, ain't we? \nBUDDY Are you sick? \nBUSH Just going through the motions. \nBUDDY What does that mean? \nBUSH There's Alive and there's Dead. And there's a worst place in between them that I hope you never know nothing about. \n(DARKENING) Do you know who hurt you? \nBUDDY No, sir. \nBUSH Sonsabitches. \nBUDDY It doesn't matter. Listen. Frank went somewhere and the raffle money is gone. \nBUSH You figure he took off with it? \nBUDDY I don't know. I don't want to think that. But the money's not here and I don't know where it is. He said he'd call and he never did. \nBuddy glances into the shadows and sees the casket looming on the sawhorses. He stares at it.. \n", "test3_id": 923}

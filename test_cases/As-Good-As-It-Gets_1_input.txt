SIMON Okay. Well, one day my father came in on one of those painting sessions when I was nine -- and he just started screaming at her -- at us -- at evil. And... 
MELVIN (very quickly) ... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano. 
CAROL Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on. 
SIMON I was trying to defend my mother and make peace, in the lamest way. I said, "she's not naked -- it's art." And then he started hitting me. And he beat me unconscious. After that he talked to me less and less -- he knew before I left for college, my dad came into my room. He held out his hand. It was filled with money. A big wad of sweaty money. (gathers himself) And he said to me, "I don't want you to ever come back." I grabbed him and I hugged him... He turns and walked out. 
Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as strange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so much more complicated than her meat and potatoes troubles. She looks out her window -- then kisses her fingers and touches them to Simon's cheek. A nice, understated, gesture of friendship. 
CAROL Well, you know -- I still stay what I said. You've got to get past it all when it comes to your parents. We all have these horror stories to get over. 
Melvin shifts INTO the FRAME. 
MELVIN That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good. 
CAROL No. 
SIMON Not it at all, really. 
MELVIN (a veteran's irony) Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money. 
INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM/CARL'S ROOM - DAY 
MELVIN Two bedrooms and the sofa opens... 
Carol is on the phone in the living room -- she hangs up. 
CAROL (to Simon) No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one? 
MELVIN Yes... sure. (to Simon) I'll take the sofa. 
Carol walks into her room -- the nicest room she'll ever have slept in... She goes to the phone and dials... 
CAROL (into phone) Hello... Hi, Spencer... Why are you out of breath? You did?!? That is great... So great... So -- no, wait a second, Spence... 
INT. HOTEL SUITE - MELVIN AND SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Melvin watches Simon struggle to unpack his especially neat suitcase. Melvin is uncomfortable. 
MELVIN Can I ask you a personal question? 
Simon laughs loudly in apprehension squared. 
MELVIN Do you ever get an erection for a woman? 
SIMON Melvin... 
MELVIN Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not... 
SIMON You consider your life easy. 
MELVIN I give you that one... (eyes suitcase) Nice packing. 
INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Carol enters the common living room... Melvin is sitting there. Carol is dealing with a number of unsettling new factors in her life. 
CAROL My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing. 
MELVIN Dancing? 
SIMON I can't, I'm exhausted. 
Carol walks to Simon and puts an arm on him. Melvin is visibly disturbed by her gesture. 
CAROL (to Simon) I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything? 
SIMON No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along. 
CAROL What a nice compliment.

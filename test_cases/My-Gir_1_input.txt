VADA Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish. 
SHELLY Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish? 
VADA (angry) NO!, He's fine. (less angry, talking to fish) Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish. 
Shelly and Harry exchange worried looks, Vada doesn't seem to have understood 
ANNOUNCER THE BUMPER CARS!! THE BUMPER CARS!! FOR JUST 50 CENTS A HALF DOLLAR, FIVE DIMES, 10 NICKELS, WE HAVE A RIDE THAT'S GUARANTEED TO REARRANGE ALL OF YOUR INTERNAL ORGANS. 
SHELLY Oh bumper cars, oh you can't go to a carnival and not ride the bumper cars. 
HARRY I fall asleep at the wheel. 
VADA (malicious grin) I'll ride on the bumper cars with you! 
SHELLY Oh great Vada, come on... 
They run off leaving Harry to carry the teddy bear and the fish 
SHELLY (to the attendant) Uhh, two. (to Vada) I got the blue one!! 
Vada runs in past Shelly and seats herself in a car 
VADA NO! 
SHELLY Yes!! 
Shelly gets in the blue one 
SHELLY (pointing at Vada) I am gonna get you. 
Vada straps herself in, Shelly turns around and gives Vada the thumbs up, Vada looks VERY intent on brutally murdering something now, and she returns the thumbs up, as she does so, music begins to play and the power is turned on, the song is "Bad Moon Rising" 
HARRY Vada, keep your hands on the wheel!! 
Vada rushes straight at Shelly and rams into her at top speed, so that Shelly's car is spun around a little, Shelly screams, this is all in good fun, at the moment. Then Vada rams her again, and again, and again, and again, and eventually, Shelly does not look too pleased, she can't escape Vada 
HARRY Careful Vada, careful. 
HARRY Shelly LOOK OUT! 
WWHHAAMMM 
Shelly and Vada pull up along side each other, Vada gives Shelly a satisfied but still spiteful grin

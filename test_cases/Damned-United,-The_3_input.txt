141   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY - (1974)                          141 
CLOUGH and his SONS are packing together CLOUGH's belongings in a couple of boxes. A knock at the door.. 
DUNCAN MACKENZIE comes in, in track suit, a cigarette in hand. Ready for the day's training.. 
MACKENZIE Just wanted to say, it's not right. They should have given you more time. CLOUGH Good lad. 
MACKENZIE Not just me that feels that way, either. 
CLOUGH The sad thing is, it won't work. You can't change a manager like a pair of socks. It'll happen once, to me - and never again. 
CLOUGH shakes CLARKE's hand. 
`Rrrrinng', the phone rings. CLOUGH turns and picks up the phone. He listens, then..

CLOUGH (cont'd) (into phone) All right. But you'll have to make it quick. 
CLOUGH hangs up. Looks at his SONS.. 
CLOUGH (cont'd) Something we have to do on the way. Won't take long.

143   INT. YORKSHIRE TV STUDIOS - DAY - (1974)                     143 
CLOUGH sits in make-up. The door opens and AUSTIN MITCHELL, the same presenter as earlier, sticks his head round the corner.. MITCHELL Thanks for agreeing to this. 
CLOUGH No problem. 
CLOUGH smiles. Uncharacteristically vulnerable. 
CLOUGH (cont'd) Go easy on me, though. There's a good lad. 
144   INT. YORKSHIRE TV STUDIOS - DAY - (1974)                     144 CLOUGH is led into the studio, and onto the `Calender' set, chatting to the SOUND MAN. 
CLOUGH's microphone is fixed, he is shown to his seat beside the PRESENTER's. Then CLOUGH notices a third (empty) seat beside his.. 
CLOUGH What's this? We expecting guests? 
Then CLOUGH looks up to see a distinctive BLUE BLAZER, with gold buttons approaching the set... 
Blue blazer. DON's blazer.

CLOUGH's face falls as DON REVIE and AUSTIN MITCHELL turn the corner, in conspiratorial conversation, and out to the seats.. 
It's a set-up! CLOUGH looks over at AUSTIN MITCHELL and the crew, who shiftily avoids CLOUGH's eyes.. 
CLOUGH (cont'd) You bastards! 
REVIE is put in the seat beside CLOUGH. Avoiding CLOUGH's eyes. REVIE rolls his neck, crosses his legs. Vast, intimidating REVIE. Ready for battle. 
Suddenly, the theme music plays, the FLOOR MANAGER counts down.. 
FLOOR MANAGER Five, four, three.. The PRESENTER looks up.. 
MITCHELL Good evening. Tonight the football world was stunned by the news that Brian Clough has been sacked as manager of Leeds United. We'll be talking not just to Brian Clough, but also to the man he replaced, who's success he couldn't emulate, Don Revie. 
MITCHELL turns to CLOUGH.. 
MITCHELL (cont'd) To Brian Clough first of all. What's your reaction to being sacked in this fashion? 
CLOUGH Obviously, Austin, my initial reaction is one of shock at finding myself here with Revie... 
REVIE See? Not so easy to make accusations when it's to someone's face... 
CLOUGH ...but in answer to your question, six weeks is hardly a long time to be given a chance in any job. I would hope Revie would get a lot longer time in his.

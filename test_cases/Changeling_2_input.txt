The Administrator senses that he's sincere, and troubled. 
ADMINISTRATOR He's off-duty until tomorrow, but... I'll see what I can do. No promises. 
And with that, the administrator heads away. 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON 
Gordon Northcott is hitch-hiking by the side of the road. A truck approaches, passes him...then slows and stops. Gordon runs up to the truck as the DRIVER leans out. 
DRIVER How far you going? 
GORDON Vancouver. 
DRIVER Hop in. 
Gordon climbs into the truck and goes to shove his bag under the seat...when something metallic bangs underneath. He lifts out a short length of metal pipe. DRIVER Don't worry about that, pal. Just a little insurance. A couple of guys tried to hijack my truck a few years ago so they could run booze over the border. You can't be too safe, you know? 
GORDON Yeah, I surely do. 
Gordon smiles, moves as if to hand the pipe back...and suddenly SLAMS it DOWN on the Driver's head...over and over and over. Blood splatters his face. Breathing hard, Gordon shoves the Driver out of the truck into the undergrowth then drives off.

INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - HALLWAY - DAY 
Wearing a bandage on one arm, Christine is escorted down the hall by one of the nurses. She's led into -- 
INT. HOSPITAL - STEELE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
-- where DOCTOR JONATHAN STEELE stands as Christine enters. He's in his fifties, heavy-set, serious. 
STEELE Mrs. Collins...Dr. Jonathan Steele. Please, have a seat. 
The nurse leaves. Christine notes that there are three chairs in a row. Could be a test. She sits in the middle chair. Sits as straight as she can. Trying to look sane. 
STEELE I hope your stay has been comfortable so far. 
CHRISTINE Fine.   Thank you. 
STEELE Really? I'd think it would be quite difficult at first. 
CHRISTINE (catching herself) Well, it was. Difficult, I mean. But comfortable. 
He makes a note of this. She grimaces. This isn't going well. He motions to the bandage on her arm. 
STEELE I see they took a blood test. 
CHRISTINE Wasserman Test. To check for syphilis. Apparently it can affect the mind. 
STEELE The idea that someone thinks you should be checked for syphilis...did that upset you? 
CHRISTINE No. Not at all. I'm sure it's... standard procedure. 
She smiles a forced smile.   Trying to appear level-headed. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                  65. 
STEELE Yes. Exactly. Standard procedure. We have to cover all bases, and -- 
CHRISTINE (covering her bases) But...at the same time...I imagine that it would be...would probably be upsetting to...some people that someone else might...suspect that of them. (beat) However inappropriate that might be. 
She flashes another wan smile. He makes another note, picks up the report on his desk, glances it over. 
STEELE According to your file, you believe the police have substituted a fake boy for your son. Is that true? 
CHRISTINE I didn't say they substituted a fake boy, just...not the right boy. (beat) They brought back the wrong boy. Not my son. He's still missing. 
He starts pulling out papers from his file. 
STEELE That's strange...you see, I have here a newspaper article with a photo of you at the train station, welcoming your son home. That is you in the photo, isn't it? CHRISTINE Yes. 
STEELE So at first he was your son, but now he's not your son. (beat) Has this been going on for a long time? People...changing, becoming something other than what they are? 
CHRISTINE People don't change, doctor. 
STEELE You don't think people change? 
CHANGELING A True Story                                     66. 
CHRISTINE That's not what I -- 
STEELE And the police...they're not out to persecute you? 
CHRISTINE No.    Of course not. 
STEELE The police are here to protect us. 
CHRISTINE That's right. 
He nods. She's trying to say what she thinks he wants to hear. It's a chess match that ends with: 
STEELE That's odd, because according to the head nurse, when you were admitted you accused the police of conspiring to do this deliberately, to punish you. So either she and the interns are also conspiring against you...or you're changing your story. (beat) Do you often have trouble telling reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins? 
He sits back.    Christine's face tells the story.

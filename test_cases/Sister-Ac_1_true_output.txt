The sun is just barely rising, as the convent BELL tolls. 
INT. CHRISTY'S CELL 
Christy is fast asleep.  There is a RAPPING at the door. 
MARY ROBERT (0.S.) Sister Mary Clarence! 
EXT. CONVENT HALLWAY 
All the nuns are proceeding, in their simple robes and nightshirts, down the hallway. 
Christy's door opens; she is still in her nightshirt, and her hair is a mess. 
CHRISTY What? 
Mary Robert, in her nightshirt, stands outside. 
MARY ROBERT Come on, we're late. 
CHRISTY What?  What time is it? 
MARY ROBERT It's after five.  We have to bathe. 
CHRISTY (groaning) Five a.m.? 
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Christy is standing on line in the hall, along with several other nuns; they are waiting to take showers.  They carry soap and towels.

MARY PATRICK (sincerely) Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well? 
CHRISTY Right. 
MARY ROBERT Is this like your old convent? 
MARY PATRICK Which convent was that, Sister? 
CHRISTY Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside. 
MARY LAZARUS Enough jabber. 
MARY LAZARUS is a much older nun; she is very no-nonsense, a hard-liner. 
CHRISTY What? 
MARY LAZARUS Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place. 
CHRISTY Like this place? 
MARY LAZARUS I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton. 
INT. BATHING ROOM 
A stone room that is very medieval-looking.  One wall is divided into stalls by wooden partitions.  In each stall is a nun, standing beneath a crude shower head that releases a thin stream of lukewarm water.  We see only the nuns' heads and shoulders. 
Still sleepy, Christy leans against the wall of her stall, her eyes closed.  Lost in thought, she begins singing softly to herself.

CHRISTY MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK AND YOU'RE GONNA BE IN TROUBLE 
A FEW OTHER NUNS (very softly) HEY-LA, HEY-LA 
Christy looks up from her reverie; she looks around.  The other nuns are bathing, their eyes down.  There is no sign of singing.  Christy decides to try a test. 
CHRISTY MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK HE'S GONNA SAVE MY REPUTATION 
A FEW OF THE NUNS (still very softly) HEY-LA, HEY-LA 
CHRISTY IF I WERE YOU, I'D TAKE A PERMANENT VACATION 
A FEW OF THE NUNS HEY-LA, HEY-LA MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK 
The nuns giggle. 
CHRISTY Where did that come from? 
MARY PATRICK I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes? 
MARY LAZARUS (very grouchy) Shirelles. 
CHRISTY You know that song? 
MARY PATRICK 1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall. 
CHRISTY No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING 
ALL THE NUNS HEY-LA, HEY LA 
Page 36. 
MARY LAZARUS (cutting off the song) That's enough.  We've got to get to chapel.

Mr. Johnson has scrubbed the snow scene from the window and stares with his palette at a blank pane of glass. There is a knock at the door ... 
WIDER. 
Mr. Johnson puts down the paints and crosses to open it. Betty is standing in the doorway clutching her purse and a "Lady Samsonite Weekender" bag. She stares up into his eyes. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
FULL SHOT. SHOP WINDOW. MORNING. 
Burt Campbell opens up the hardware store like he does every morning, only today there is a slight difference. He swings open the door, puts out the rakes and shovels, then sets a newly handwritten sign clearly in the front window: 
"NO COLOREDS" 
SERIES OF SHOTS. SHOP WINDOWS. 
As the businesses are opened on Main Street, more and more "NO COLOREDS" signs appear in the windows: next to the donuts ... by fishing poles ... beside the stationery supplies ... Everything else looks frighteningly the same... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY. 
Joey Anderson, the local paper boy, is finishing his morning rounds. He reaches in his bag and tosses left toward the bakery. Then he throws right toward the post office. Then he turns left toward the soda shop, does a double take and slams into a trash can ... 
WIDER. SODA SHOP. 
Where Mr. Johnson had once painted his cubist snow scene, there is a brand new painting that isn't cubist at all. A NUDE version of Betty graces the shop window--painted in curving sensual brush strokes. Joey stops his bike and just stares in amazement. He gets up and rides away as fast as he possibly can ... 
CUT TO: 
MAIN STREET. LATER ... 
David is in a happy daze, wandering up Main Street and doesn't even notice the crowd gathered outside Mr. Johnson's soda shop. After a moment or two, he glances up and sees the window ... 
CLOSER. DAVID. 
His eyes go wide. The murmur of the crowd grows louder as stray derisive comments rise above the noise. David glances from the nude in window to the growing angry mob ... 
MAIN STREET. DAY. 
David goes tearing through the business district looking for any sign of his "mother." He glances in the flower shop ... toward the green grocer ... David is just about to turn on Elm Street when a booming voice seems to come from the sky ... 
DICK VAN DYKE (OS) Bud ... 
David stops and looks to his right. There, in the window of the Philco TV store, are twenty screens of various sizes displaying the image of Dick Van Dyke. 
DICK VAN DYKE (CONT) I want a word with you ... 
DAVID (scared) Oh--well ... 
DICK VAN DYKE (BOOMING) NOW! 
The sound reverberates like God Himself. David ducks inside the store, slamming the door behind him. 
INT. STORE. 
Fifty Dick Van Dyke's stare at him from every TV in the store. The effect is smothering. 
DICK VAN DYKE (still pretty loud) What the hell do you think you're doing! 
David glances around, not sure where to look. 
DAVID (terrified) What do you mean? 
DICK VAN DYKE What do I MEAN! (beat) You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ... 
DAVID Look--it just sort of "happened" ... 
DICK VAN DYKE A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ... (louder) You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ... 
DAVID I had nothing to do with that. 
DICK VAN DYKE Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again? 
DAVID Look ... 
DICK VAN DYKE It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is? 
DAVID (beat/ quietly) ... Only if they mean it. 
Dick Van Dyke looks at him for a beat, then goes "red" in the face. 
DICK VAN DYKE OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF! 
DAVID (finding courage) I didn't do anything wrong. 
DICK VAN DYKE Oh no? Let me show you something! 
SHOT. TV SCREEN. 
All at once a box appears in the upper right hand comer of the screen containing the image of David and Margaret at Lover's Lane. The VIDEOTAPE rolls forward as she extends the BRIGHT RED APPLE. David hesitates, then takes it, then puts it to his mouth and takes a bite. 
DICK VAN DYKE "YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS PLACE." 
The image of David biting the apple PLAYS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS like some football instant replay ... 
DICK VAN DYKE (CONT) YOU DON'T DESERVE TO LIVE IN THIS PARADISE! 
WIDER. 
David just stares at the repeated images of Dick Van Dyke on the TV screens. 
DICK VAN DYKE (quickly) Where's the remote control I gave you? 
DAVID Why? 
DICK VAN DYKE Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was. 
DAVID No you're not. 
DICK VAN DYKE EXCUSE ME?

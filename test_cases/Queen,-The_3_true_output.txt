EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - INNER COURTYARD - DAY 
The inner courtyard of Buckingham Palace. In a ritual unchanged since Queen Victoria, a uniformed PIPER, wearing a kilt of Ancient Hunting Stuart tartan, marches under her Majesty's windows, playing the bagpipes. 
t's her morning alarm call, and it's the way she wakes up wherever she is - anywhere in the world. 
INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - QUEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Darkness. A soft knock at the door. (The strains of bagpipes can still be heard from below). Her Majesty's DRESSER sticks her head round the corner, with a calling tray of Earl Grey tea and the newspapers. 
MAID G'morning, Ma'am. 
The DRESSER puts the tea and newspapers on a bedside table. 
DRESSER Shall I draw the curtains? 
The QUEEN's sleepy voice answers..`Please'. The DRESSER goes to the window. 
ELIZABETH (O.S) Did you stay up? 
DRESSER Yes, Ma'am. 
ELIZABETH (O.S) And? Was it as expected..? 
The QUEEN's hand reaches for spectacles, then for the newspapers. She puts on her glasses. 
RESSER Yes, Ma'am. Mr Blair, by a landslide. 
The QUEEN's expression changes.. 
ELIZABETH I see. 
She lifts the newspaper up. The front page comes into sharp focus. 
FULL FRAME: the beaming smile of TONY BLAIR, the new Prime Minister. The QUEEN stares back. Their eyes meet - as it were. Headlines tell us.. 
"IT'S BLAIR!", "LANDSLIDE VICTORY FOR BLAIR". 
INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY 
The QUEEN sits at breakfast. Reading the newspapers. Dogs under the table. A knock on the door, and ROBIN JANVRIN, (40's), her deputy Private Secretary, pops around.. 
JANVRIN The Prime Minister is on his way, Ma'am. 
ELIZABETH To BE, Robin. (correcting, terse) Prime Minister to BE. 
The QUEEN frostily flicks a page, without looking up.. 
ELIZABETH (cont'd) He hasn't asked my permission yet. 
INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CORRIDOR - DAY 
The QUEEN and JANVRIN walk through a corridor of the Palace. It has the air of a grand hotel. Chintz. Flock. Long, gilded mirrors. Portraits on the walls.. 
ELIZABETH He's a hard one to read, isn't he? 
JANVRIN Yes. On the one hand his background is quite establishment. Father a Conservative. A public school education at Fettes, where he was tutored by the same man as the Prince of Wales. 
ELIZABETH Well, we'll try not to hold that against him. 
JANVRIN On the other, his manifesto promises the most radical modernisation and shake-up of the Constitution in three hundred years. 
ELIZABETH Oh. Is he going to `modernise' us, do you think? 
JANVRIN I wouldn't put it past him. He's married to a woman with known anti- Monarchist sympathies - you may remember her curtsey the first time you met. It could best be described as `shallow'. 
ELIZABETH I don't measure the depth of a curtsey, Robin. I leave that to my sister. 
JANVRIN And I spoke to the Cabinet Secretary who said he was expecting the atmosphere at Downing Street to be very informal. Everyone on first name terms. (a beat) At the Prime Minister's insistence. 
ELIZABETH What? As in `Call me Tony?' 
JANVRIN Yes.

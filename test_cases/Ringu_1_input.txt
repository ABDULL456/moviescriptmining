YOUNG GIRL Sorry. 
ASAKAWA Lets do it again. 
Asakawa glances over her shoulder, makes sure that Komiya is ready. 
ASAKAWA Have you heard what kind of video it might be? 
YOUNG GIRL What I heard was, all of a sudden this scaaarry lady comes on the screen and says, In one week, you will die. 
GIRL #2 I heard that if youre watching TV late at night itll come on, and then your phonell ring. 
ASAKAWA Watching TV late at night... do you know what station? 
GIRL #2 Mmmm... I heard some local station, around Izu. 
ASAKAWA Izu? 
GIRL #2 Mmm-hmm. 
ASAKAWA And, do you know if anyones really died from watching it? 
The girl flashes a look at her two friends. 
YOUNG GIRL Well, no one that we know, right? 
Girl #2 nods her head. Girl #3 nods slowly, opens and closes her mouth as if deciding whether to say something or not.  The reporter notices. 
ASAKAWA What is it? 
GIRL #3 I heard this from a friend of mine in high school.  She said that there was this one girl who watched the video, and then died a week later. She was out on a drive with her boyfriend. 
ASAKAWA They were in a wreck? 
GIRL #3 No, their car was parked, but they were both dead inside.  Her boyfriend died because hed watched the video, too.  Thats what my friend said. 
Girl #3 grows suddenly defensive. 
GIRL #3 (contd) Its true!  It was in the paper two or three days ago. 
ASAKAWA Do you know the name of the high school this girl went to? 
GIRL #3 No... I heard this from my friend, and it didnt happen at her school. She heard it from a friend at a different school, she said.

Asakawa is seated at her DESK.  The station is filled with PEOPLE, scrabbling to meet deadlines.  Komiya walks up to Asakawas desk and holds out a MANILA FOLDER.

INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY 
Telly and Casper are sitting side by side. Casper is holding a 40oz. bottle of beer. The train is semi-crowded; all seats are taken and there are a few people standing up. The train shakes. They are headed downtown. 
Casper and Telly are looking at the couple directly across from them. They are two unattractive lower-class Spanish people, they are holding hands and kissing. 
TELLY I wanna fuck Darcy. 
CASPER Who? 
TELLY Darcy. Benny's little sister. 
CASPER Oh. You like her? 
TELLY Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now. 
CASPER Darcy? 
TELLY Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent. 
CASPER Yeah. She's only 13. 
TELLY It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember? 
CASPER Yeah. 
TELLY She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her. 
CASPER (excited) Yeah. 
TELLY I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt. 
CASPER (smiling) Yeah. 
TELLY And after about two seconds, I got the biggest hard-on. 
Casper starts laughing. 
TELLY I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection. 
CASPER I know what you mean. 
TELLY At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin. 
CASPER She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them. 
TELLY I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her. 
CASPER (laughing) How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law. 
TELLY I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me. 
CASPER Bet. 
The two of them shake hands. 
CASPER You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted? 
TELLY I guess so. I gotta stop off home too. 
At this point the sound of the subway door is heard. A black man with no legs pushes himself through with his hands. He has a large container filled with change. As he enters, his cup of change is heard smashing back and forth. His face is even with people's knees. A random few stuff change and dollar bills into his cup. He sings as he pushes his way through the cat. He has an afro pick sticking out the back of his head. He is wearing a shirt that says "KISS ME I'M POLISH". 
LEGLESS MAN (singing) I have no legs. I have no legs. I have no legs. I have no legs. 
As he pushes his way closer, Casper starts checking his all his pockets. When he gets about three feet away, Casper stands up and throws some pennies into his cup. He sits back down next to Telly. 
The legless man stops and smiles at Casper.

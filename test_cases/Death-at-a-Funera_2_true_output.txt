AARON Listen, about the condo and the baby, 
I PROMISE-- 
MICHELLE We'll work it out. Let's just get this day over with. Then we can worry about the rest of our lives. Aaron hugs Michelle. 
AARON I can't believe I still have to do this eulogy... with everything I've just found out. A beat. 
MICHELLE It doesn't change anything, does it? 
AARON Not a thing. Reverend Davis approaches Aaron, looking at her watch and appearing flustered. 
REVEREND DAVIS We're going to have to fly through this now. I already missed a funeral and two Christenings. 
AARON Sure. Let's go. 
REVEREND DAVIS Do you want an open casket? 
AARON/RYAN/NORMAN/JEFF No! The reverend looks shocked at the reaction, but ignores it. She stands up at the front and speaks quickly. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
REVEREND DAVIS Alright! Everybody in their seats now! (she snaps her fingers) Hey, you, sit down. People settle into their seats. Ryan manages to squeeze in next to Martina. He smiles at her, flirtatiously. Cynthia throws Ryan a look, and he gets up and goes to sit with her. 
REVEREND DAVIS (CONT'D) (speaking very quickly) I'd like to apologize on behalf of the family for all of the distractions. I hope that everyone is settled and ready to continue with the service. Aaron, the oldest son, would like to say a few words about his father. Michelle gives Aaron an encouraging look as he makes his way to the front. Aaron clears his throat and prepares to begin. The room is absolutely silent. He takes a deep breath. ANGLE ON: The reverend nodding for Aaron to hurry up. ANGLE ON: Aaron. 
AARON My father... was an exceptional-- 
BANG! BANG! BANG! Suddenly, a loud banging emanates from the coffin. Everyone stares at it in stunned silence. Jeff looks over to Norman whose eyes are as wide as saucers. Aaron looks like a deer caught in headlights. He looks at Ryan who gestures to him to continue. He nervously struggles on. 
AARON (CONT'D) My father was an exceptional man. 
BANG! BANG! BANG! Everyone stares at the coffin in awe. Aaron bravely continues. 
AARON (CONT'D) Not only did he live for his family, but he was always there for others-- 
BANG! BANG! BANG! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
DUNCAN What the hell is going on? 
MOURNER 1 There's someone in there! 
OSCAR I knew it! I knew it! Suddenly the coffin lid flips off and everyone stares in wonder as Frank sits up, looking like a crazy person, and babbling incoherently. Several people scream. Frank opens the other end of the coffin and looks at his dead lover. 
RYAN (trying to cover) What the hell are you doing in my Dad's coffin? Frank starts grabbing at Edward's body screaming. 
FRANK Edward! Edward! Edward! Ryan, Norman and Jeff try to pull Frank out of the coffin, but he's holding onto the corpse. 
FRANK (CONT'D) No! No! Finally they get Frank out and carry him from the room. As he passes Cynthia, the photos fall out of his pocket at her feet. As Duncan closes the coffin again, Cynthia bends down and picks up one of the photographs and stares at it. Her face turns to horror as she makes out the image. The noise in the room is broken by Cynthia's furious cry. She drops the photos and runs at Frank. 
CYNTHIA You bastard! Cynthia tackles Frank and starts beating him. 
CYNTHIA (CONT'D) (as she hits him) He was with you! Duncan picks up the photos. He shows them to Uncle Russell. 
(CONTINUED)

UNCLE RUSSELL I always thought he had a little sugar in his tank. Everything has descended into total chaos until Aaron finally shouts across the room. 
AARON 
MY FATHER WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL MAN!!! Everyone, including Frank and Cynthia, looks at Aaron, stunned. They all freeze. There's a long silence. 
AARON (CONT'D) He had his... shortcomings, but he took care of his family. He loved his family. He loved this house. He worked hard. All I wanted today was to show him how much we all loved and admired him. To give him the respect that he deserved... Is that really so much to ask? We all get so distracted by the... little things in life. We forget about the important things. Like the fact that we lost a great man. The mourners look up at Aaron with undivided attention. 
AARON (CONT'D) So maybe he loved "Dreamgirls" more than most men. We don't know why a man makes the choices he makes. But I do know that my father made the best choices he could make. Life is complicated. We're just thrown here together in a world filled with chaos and confusion... and we do our best. And Dad did his best... Aaron looks over at the coffin. As.he speaks, we see shots of Cynthia, Frank, Jeff, Norman, Duncan as they are moved by Aaron's words. 
AARON (CONT'D) He taught us to go for what we wanted in life, because you never know how long you're going to be here... And whether you succeed... or you fail... the important thing is that you tried. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (5) A beat. Michelle looks up at her husband with pride. We see the various other mourners looking at Aaron and listening. 
AARON (CONT'D) So when you all leave here today, I want you to remember Dad for who he really was... A decent, loving man who never condemned anyone for how they lived. Who never cast disparaging remarks or held prejudices against race, gender... height. If only we could all be as giving, as generous, as understanding as my father... Even dead, my father has more character than everyone in this room. If I am half the man my father was, my child will be incredibly blessed. Aaron turns and walks out of the room. Everyone watches him go. Michelle follows him out of the room.

Corin walks out of the forge, looking around for Conan. Various other Cimmerians go about the daily routine, but Conan is nowhere to be seen. 
CORIN Conan? 
Corin looks to the ridge above the village, noticing a thick fog creeping in. The fog curls and eddies, something is out there. 
Suddenly, Lucius and his legion of silver-armored warriors burst out of the fog, attacking with speed and strength. 
But the Cimmerians are hardly caught flat footed. In seconds they are armed, and they counter the charge with a furious charge of their own. 
SLAM! Sword and bone collide as the two enemy fronts smash into each other. And the battle devolves into one-on-ones -- 
Where the barbarians have the upper hand. Uran and Corin lead the main push of battle-frenzied barbarians as they swing their huge broadswords, extending their reach advantage over the Aquilonian's shorter weapons. 
And quickly, the Aquilonian's numbers are cut in half. Corin squares off against Lucius himself. Lucius is sweating. Worried. It wasn't supposed to be this hard. 
LUCIUS Retreat! 
As a unit, the Aquilonians race back into the woods. In seconds, the Cimmerians give chase in wild pursuit. 
CORIN Wait! Hold your ground! 
But it's too late, nearly half the Cimmerian warriors are gone on the chase. 
EXT. CLIFF FACE - DAY 
Lucius and the Aquilonians race up to a sheer cliff face. Nowhere left to run. They turn to see the Cimmerians gathering in front of them. 
URAN Death is in the air, invaders. Can you taste it? 
LUCIUS (SMILES) Indeed. I savor it. 
Uran notices something is wrong. His eyes go skyward. Atop the cliff stand Cheren and a dozen more of his blind archers, bows at the ready with FLAMING ARROWS. 
They let the arrows fly, streaking balls of flame heading right for the Cimmerians. But they do not hit them. They hit the tree trunks beside them. 
And for a moment, the Cimmerians look relieved, until they notice small bags of a black substance tied to the arrows. The flames lick at the substance -- 
KABOOM! The forest erupts into flames as the Cimmerian warriors are burned alive. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN LAKE - DAY 
Conan spins, started by the sound of the explosion. He sees flames rising above the treetops beyond. 
He races back home. 
EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY 
Corin sees the flames in the distance as well. Suddenly, Ukafa and his Kushite warriors erupt out of the forest. Armed with fearsome barbed spears they charge the remaining Cimmerians, savage against savage. 
But the Kushites are not alone. From behind the Cimmerians comes, AKHUN, a massive four hundred pounds of flesh, wearing loops of chains like armor, leads his turbaned TURANIAN HORSEMEN into the village. 
The Cimmerian WOMEN arm themselves, but the Horsemen attack with NINE TAILED WHIPS pulling their swords from their hands and dragging them to the ground. 
The Horsemen quickly gather up the women while Ukafa and his men keep the Cimmerian warriors all too occupied. 
CONAN 
Conan rushes through a river, now tinged red with blood, and reaches the far end of the village. 
Huts burn, women are chained, only a handful of Cimmerians still stand. Lucius and his Aquilonian mercenaries are helping the Spearmen slay the wounded. 
Conan grabs a fallen sword and rushes for the nearest Aquilonian and RUNS HIM THROUGH. A ZINGARAN spots him and rushes him with his spear. Conan readies himself for the CHARGE -- 
When the Zingaran loses his head, lopped off by Corin's blade. 
CONAN Father! 
CORIN Come. 
Corin, sporting a deep gash to his abdomen, pulls a reluctant Conan from the battle, back toward the forge. 
INT. FORGE - DAY 
The flames of the forge still burn as Corin pushes Conan into the room. He bolts the door behind him. 
CONAN Do we need more weapons?

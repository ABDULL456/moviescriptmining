KIRK (formally; rising) Welcome aboard, Lieutenant. 
99   ACROSS ILIA TO DECKER                                       99 
as Ilia starts to speak, suddenly stops: she has just then noticed Decker, who has stepped from his station to face her. For an electronic moment their eyes meet, hold in unquestioned recognition. 
DECKER Hello, Ilia. 
ILIA (surprised) Decker....! 
Kirk has observed this with surprise and some concern (it presages possible complications). Decker turns to Kirk, slightly uncomfortable at this. DECKER I was stationed on the Lieutenant's home planet some years ago... 
Ilia looks from Kirk back to Decker, puzzled at his sleeve stripes. 
ILIA (eyes his rank stripes) 'Commander' Decker? 
KIRK Our Exec and Science Officer... 
DECKER (bitingly) Captain Kirk has the utmost confidence in me. 
Kirk flashes a hard glance at Decker, then toward Ilia too. 
KIRK (pointedly) And in you, too, Lieutenant. 
ILIA My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties? 
While respectful, her tone of voice has been just as firm as Kirk's. 
KIRK By all means. 
100   ACROSS KIRK TO UHURA                                       100 
receiving a message, now relaying it. 
UHURA Captain, Starfleet reports our last six crew members ready to beam up... (puzzled) ... but one of them is refusing to step into the transporter. 
Just as Kirk a moment before was tense, now suddenly he's relaxed again; he rises. 
KIRK (pleased) Oh? I'll see that he beams up...! 
And he hurries from the bridge, onto the elevator, is gone. A moment of puzzled silence, then: DECKER Mr. Sulu, take Lieutenant Ilia in hand. 
SULU (startled) Sir...? (then understands) Yes, of course... (to Ilia) Your pre-programming is already set in, Lieutenant. 
Sulu has almost tripped getting out of his chair. He starts offering Ilia his hand, then thinks better of it, withdraws it abruptly, immediately busies himself punching out equations on her console... AD LIBS, "It's all on the computer. You'll have no problem..." Sulu is nervous, fluttery around this lovely creature -- now hits a wrong switch. Produces a BEEPING SOUND which he fumbles to shut off. She smiles; speaks quietly, repeats: 
ILIA I'm sworn to celibacy, Mister Sulu. That makes me as safe as any human female. 
Sulu catches her eye but before he can reply, Decker has moved in beside Ilia. 
DECKER I now the Captain meant no person- al insult. 
ILIA (eyes on console) I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species. (looks at him) You can assure him that's true, can't you? 
Clearly, the remark carries special, personal significance. 
101    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM                                      101 
Kirk entering as Rand and her assistant electronically list the last of the five arrivals who are leaving the Transporter Chamber. Kirk calls through intercom to the last arrival, a young female Yeoman. 
KIRK Yeoman, what was the problem down there? 
YEOMAN (through intercom) He insisted we go first, sir. Said something about first seeing how it scrambled our molecules. 
KIRK Thank you, Yeoman (hits transmit control) Starfleet , this is Captain Kirk. The officer is to be beamed up immediately! 
103   ANGLE ON THE CHAMBER (O)                                   103 
A moment, then again the GENERATING HUMMING, and then the familiar BEAMING EFFECT. And then you SEE McCOY! He fully MATERIALIZES. He looks himself over as if in pleased surprise he is still in one piece. CAMERA PANS McCoy from the Transporter Chamber to Kirk who is hav- ing a hard time containing his amusement and delight. 
KIRK Well, for a man who swore he'd never return to Starfleet... 
McCOY (flat, tight) What happened, Captain, sir, was that your revered Admiral Nogura invoked a little known -- and seldom used -- reserve activation clause... (snaps) ... in simpler language, Captain, sir, they drafted me! 
KIRK (straight-faced) They didn't...! 
Kirk has offered his hand, but McCoy is already flaring: 
McCOY This was your idea! It was your idea, wasn't it! 
KIRK Bones, there's a 'thing' out there -- 
McCOY -- Why is any object we don't understand called a 'thing'? 
KIRK (continues) -- headed this way. I need you... McCOY Were you behind this? 
KIRK (nods) Bones, I need you badly.

KAFFEE Corporal, would you turn to the page in this book that says where the enlisted men's mess hall is? 
HOWARD Lt. Kaffee, that's not in the book, sir. 
KAFFEE I don't understand, how did you know where the enlisted men's mess hall was if it's not in this book? 
HOWARD I guess I just followed the crowd at chow time, sir. 
KAFFEE No more questions. 
KAFFEE chucks the book back on ROSS's desk. 
RANDOLPH Corporal Howard, you can step down. 
HOWARD (greatly relieved) Thank you, sir. 
KAFFEE gives HOWARD a subtle "You Did Good, Kid" look, and we 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DUSK 
It's the end of the day's session. KAFFEE walks down the hall with SAM and JO. 
KAFFEE Seven tonight, we'll do a final Kendrick review. I want to slam- dunk this guy. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SIDEWALK STAND - NIGHT 
KAFFEE'S CAR 
as it drives along a street in the D.C. business district. it's evening now and the windshield wipers are fighting against a rain KAFFEE pulls over at his usual newsstand. He hops out, leaving the lights flashing and the door open, and runs to the stand. 
KAFFEE Hey, Luther. 
LUTHER Admiral, how's the big case goin'? 
KAFFEE Nose to the grindstone. 
LUTHER No flies on you. 
KAFFEE A rolling stone gathers no moss. 
LUTHER Yeah, well it ain't over til the fat lady sings. 
KAFFEE Ain't that the truth. Catch you tomorrow. 
He gets back in his car, tosses the newspaper on the passenger seat, and turns on the ignition. And as soon as he does 
-- a hand is slapped over his mouth -- 
VOICE (O.S.) It's Matthew Markinson. 
-- and KAFFEE jumps out of his skin. 
Because sitting in the back seat, in civilian clothes, is MARKINSON. 
KAFFEE Jesus fucking Christ!!-- 
MARKINSON You left the door unlocked. 
KAFFEE Scared the shit outta me. 
MARKINSON Drive. 
KAFFEE Are you aware you're under subpoena? 
MARKINSON Yes. I'm also aware that the lives of two marines are in your hands. If there was something I could do about that, I would, but since I can't, all I can do is help you. Why don't you drive, Lieutenant. 
KAFFEE begins driving down the street. 
KAFFEE What do you know? 
MARKINSON I know everything. 
KAFFEE Was it a code red? 
MARKINSON Yes. 
KAFFEE Did Kendrick give the order? 
MARKINSON Yes. 
KAFFEE Did you witness it? 
MARKINSON I didn't need to -- 
KAFFEE Did you witness it?! 
MARKINSON No. 
KAFFEE Then how do you know? 
MARKINSON I know. 
KAFFEE You know shit. 
MARKINSON He was never gonna be transferred off the base. 
And with this, KAFFEE screeches the car over to the side of the road. He grabs the parking brake and pulls it up. He turns to Markinson. 
MARKINSON (continuing) Jessep was going to keep him on the base. He said he wanted him trained.

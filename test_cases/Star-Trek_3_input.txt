Nero reaches for something under the counter Pike lies upon. Retrieves A FAMILIAR GLASS CONTAINER -- inside -- DOZENS OF CENTAURIAN SLUGS, the very ones used on Nero. 
NERO It's not the fault of the human race that Starfleet chose Earth as its center. You're a more noble race than my fallen cousins. I'll take no pleasure in your extinction. 
PIKE How reassuring. 
Nero opens the container, reaches for a pair of TONGS 
NERO The frequencies, please. 
PIKE Christopher Pike -- Captain, U.S.S. Enterprise, registry NCC-1701. 
Nero sad-smiles.   What he expected.

NERO As you wish. 
A ROMULAN GUARD HOLDS PIKE'S MOUTH -- Nero uses the tongs -- and OFF PIKE'S EXPRESSION --

Our POV is BLURRY. We come into FOCUS on a blinking instrument panel. KIRK is stirring awake, his shoulder kills. He sits up: inside a ONE-MAN POD CRAFT. He WIPES THE GLASS -- looks up -- like a TUNNEL OF SNOW, 30 feet long, to the sky. THE PODCRAFT'S EMBEDDED ON THE SURFACE OF A VAST, ICE PLANET. Kirk's been MAROONED. He closes his eyes, his face falls... 
KIRK Computer...    where am I? 
COMPUTER VOICE Current location Delta Vega: Class "M" Planet, unsafe. You have been ordered to remain in your pod until retrieved by Starfleet authorities. 
KIRK Bite me, how's that. 
The CANOPY RISES -- a blast of cold air hits Kirk -- with some agony, out he goes -- he CLIMBS UP THE TUBE OF SNOW -- and gets to the surface -- looks out. HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF FUCKING NOWHERE. Finally: 
KIRK (CONT'D) SONOFABITCH-BITCH-BITCH! THERE'S NOTHING HERE!!! YOU NECK-PINCHING MOTHERF--!!! 
SMASH CUT TO:

TRACKING along a massive ICE SHEET... Kirk ENTERS FRAME walking along, cold, pissed... whips out a TRICORDER, speaks into it: 
KIRK Lieutenant's log, supplemental: I'm preparing a testimonial for my Starfleet court martial assuming there's still a Starfleet left. 
From overhead, what we see -- what Kirk doesn't -- is something HUGE, SLITHERING UNDERWATER beneath the ice --

KIRK (CONT'D) Acting Captain Spock -- whose only form of expression's apparently limited to his left damn eyebrow -- has marooned me on Delta Vega in what I believe to be a violation of security protocol 49.09, governing the treatment of prisoners aboard a st-- 
159   EXT. DELTA VEGA - PLANET SURFACE - CONTINUOUS                    159 
Kirk FREEZES at a nearby GROWL. He looks -- sees nothing -- then ANOTHER GROWL -- he turns -- some thirty feet away, an eleven foot-tall cross between a polar bear and a gorilla (it's a POLARILLA) steps out from behind a mass of ice. Sees Kirk. It's horrifying. Kirk takes a SLOW, SMALL STEP BACKWARD -- and the fucking thing CHARGES HIM -- KIRK RUNS, TERRIFIED -- and the POLARILLA PURSUES -- gaining -- it's gonna EAT HIM ALIVE WHEN SUDDENLY -- 
WHATEVER WAS BENEATH THE ICE EARLIER EXPLODES UP THROUGH IT -- IT'S NEARLY 30 FEET TALL, RED, HUNDREDS OF EYES -- IT SMACKS THE POLARILLA AWAY LIKE NOTHING AS KIRK FALLS TO THE ICE AND TURNS BACK -- HOLY SHIT! THIS THING IS SO MUCH WORSE! IT ROARS AS KIRK GETS TO HIS FEET AND RUNS, SCREAMING -- 
KIRK HAULS ASS AS THE THING COMES AFTER HIM -- THEN SUDDENLY HE FALLS -- DROPS -- and we see that Kirk is FALLING DOWN A MASSIVE SNOW MOUNTAIN! The huge red creature stops at the edge and ROARS LOUDLY -- until the ice shelf BREAKS AWAY! The creature starts to FALL AS WELL! Now Kirk is TUMBLING, the immense creature TUMBLING not far behind! 
And Kirk LANDS ON THE ICE, HARD -- sees a distant CAVE. Looks up at the FLAILING CREATURE that is about to CRUSH HIM -- Kirk tries to run, but the ice is TOO SLIPPERY -- FINALLY he gets footing and runs off toward the cave -- as the red creature LANDS HARD -- its sharp SPEAR LIMBS STAB into the ice as it pursues Kirk -- 
160   INT. CAVE - DAY                                                  160 
Kirk races through the darkened cave -- the creature comes after him -- Kirk goes as fast as he can -- the creature reaches out and fucking GRABS HIM -- pulls him toward the disgusting, wet, TEETHY MOUTH -- Kirk tries to hold on to anything he can -- but he's fucking LUNCH -- and just as you're SCREAMING, there's LIGHT -- FIRE LIGHT -- and a FIGURE APPEARS, WAVING A TORCH -- 
And the red creature's eyes ALL GO WILD -- and it DROPS KIRK and BACKS OFF, AFRAID -- the figure CHASES IT until it's gone. Kirk, on the ground, is freaked out, out of breath, and can't take his eyes off this man... who says:

FIGURE The Hen-Gra.   Notoriously afraid of heat.

And the Figure turns... we may have recognized the voice. IT'S SPOCK. As in NIMOY. HERE. Lit in the darkness by the fire. We'll refer to him as SPOCK PRIME. He looks at Kirk -- moves closer to him -- finally seeing him. And is amazed... 
KIRK Hey... thank you... 
SPOCK PRIME ... Jim? 
KIRK (stunned) -- how d'you know my name? 
SPOCK PRIME How did you find me--? Does Starfleet know of my presence? 
KIRK HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME? 
Spock looks deep into the eyes of the freaked out young man, feeling the full effect of fate playing its hand, but realizing he doesn't recognize him... 
SPOCK PRIME I have been... and always shall be... your friend. 
KIRK -- no, I don't know you -- the only Vulcan I know isn't exactly a buddy. 
Of all the things Spock predicted Kirk might say, it wasn't that. He's analyzing a thousand steps ahead, calculating: 
SPOCK PRIME You are James T. Kirk. Your father is George, as is your brother. Your mother's name is Winona -- you were born in 2233 -- 
KIRK Stop.   Please.     I don't understand. 
As Spock nods, we PRE-LAP:

SPOCK PRIME ... I am Spock. One hundred and thirty years senior to the Vulcan you know. 
KIRK (beat, beat, beat) Bullshit. 
161A INT. CAVE - NIGHT                                               161A 
Firelight flickers -- shadows of Kirk and Spock Prime dance on the ice walls. Remarkable NIGHT STARS outside. 
SPOCK PRIME It's remarkably pleasing to see you again. (re: Vulcan) ... especially after the events of today.

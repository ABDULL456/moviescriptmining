DUTCH One load of guns isn't going to stop him from raiding villages.. You ought to be thinking about all that money you'll have. 
PIKE

DUTCH A small bag. 
PIKE Move them a thousand miles away and buy them a ranch --. two -- three, ranches. 
DUTCH One -- a very Small ranch. 
ANGEL They'll never leave...You see, it's their land -- and no one will, ever drive them away.

CUT TO: 
INT. BODEGO - NIGHT 
228 IT IS LONG AND NARROW AND SHADOWY and Lyle, Tector and their two ladies are exploring it very carefully and with great dignity -- candles in hand. 
LYLE The dons of Spain built-this some three hundred years ago -- He belches, then looks about in awe at the huge casks.

CHANGE 
228 CONTINUED 
TECTOR Itm all for them dons'. 229 TECTOR SUDDENLY SWINGS A MATTOX ON TO a six foot cask which rests on top of two others of equal height, it bounces out of his hand. He draws his gun and fires as does Lyle. Liquid gushes down. 229A LYLE STEPS UNDER IT, lifts his face, drinks, then drags: his lady beside him. 
LYLE (as the torrent pours over them removing his 
HAT) Have a dollop, honey -- there's enough here for both of us. And. she does, tasting the good wine:; laughing. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STEAM HUT - NIGHT 
230 PIKE AND DUTCH EXCHANGE LOOKS AND HAVE ANOTHER DRINK, AS ANGEL PALES.. Both are ready to write Angel off. and forget about the problem. 
ANGEL Would you give someone a gun to kill your mother, or your father, or your brother? 231, DUTCH LOOKS AT PIKE. Pike thinks it over. Both have. another pull on the bottle. 
PIKE Son -- twenty thousand cuts a lot of. family ties. 
ANGEL No -- you gringos are no different. I have seen how Lyle takes care of his brother. He takes the bottle, drinks, then throws it on the rocks.

231 CONTINUED 
ANGEL (CONT' D ) My people don't have guns so Mapache takes the food out of their mouths and clothes off their backs. With guns my village could fight, If I could take guns to my people I would go with you -- but not just for gold, 232 THE MEN ARE MOMENTARILY SILENT. Angel lifts a bucket of water, spills part of it on his head, passes it to Sykes who drinks a little of the water, spits it out, puts the bucket down, pours two bottles of tequilla into it, drinks. again -- smiles, passes it to Angel, who drinks and passes it on. 
DUTCH 
(DRINKING) .Al]. we'd need is for El Mapache to find out we armed some village... 
SYKES Let him find out.' Mr. Bishop -- (as P ï¿½ke looks a t\ him ) You know as well as I there ain't no way of collecting from Mapache 'cept off a lot of dead bodies -- mostly ours, the way he thinks. Pike considers this -- looks at the old man, finally nods . 
ANGEL I would take guns ...if Mapache found out, you would say I stole them, 
DUTCH How many cases of rifles did Zamorra say were in that shipment? 
PIKE Twenty. 
DUTCH Give him one. 
CONTINUED 
232 CONTINUED 
PIKE' (after a long moment) You can have one case and one case of ammo, You'll give up your share of the gold. 
DUTCH __-He'll have to show up with us. when we deliver..,. 
ANGEL I' will:..

MAGGIE Do I WANT you to come with me:! To my MOTHER'S FUNERAL?! Of COURSE L want you to come, why the hell WOULLV'T you come?! But he's looking past her, at the holes in the yard. 
TOM I'm just... kind of in the middle of something here. She looks at him, absolutely incredulous -- -- and then storms back into the house, SLAMMING the door so hard two of the glass panes spiderweb. 
CUT TO: 
EXT DRIVEWAY DAY Jake, twisted around in his car seat, looks out the back window of Maggie's car. He raises one hand, waving. Tom stands in the open doorway of the garage, still in his mud- stained jeans and tee shirt. He waves back. The car pulls out of the driveway, fast, and ROARS off down the block. Jake and Maggie are gone. 
EXT BACK YARD DAY There are now five large holes in the back yard, and Tom is running out of places to dig. Nevertheless, he drags the hose across the yard to an untouched patch of grass in the far corner. He stops short. Hose won't reach. 
AT THE SPIGOT, he unscrews the hose and carries it across the yard. 
AT ANOTHER SPIGOT, this one in the far corner, he reconnects the hose and turns on the water. Nothing comes out. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
TOM Come on! Tom curses and trudges back toward the house. 
INT KITCHEN DAY Tom gets a screwdriver from a tool drawer in the kit-hen. 
INT DINING ROOM DAY Tom stomps into the dining room and goes to a closet on the far wall. He opens the door and tosses aside a carpet flap that covers the floor. He shoves the screwdriver into a crack in the floor and pries up a trap door, two feet square, in the middle of the closet floor. Through the hole, he can see a ladder resting up against the wall below. He feels for the rungs with his feet and starts to climb down. 
INT BASEMENT DAY As Tom climbs down, he reaches out for a chain that hangs from a bare bulb in the ceiling and turns it on. They have only a partial basement, a ten by ten foot space about eight feet deep. The rest of the area under the house is just crawl space, barely enough to wriggle through. Tom reaches the bottom and goes to the far side, where a mess of water pipes all converge. He picks through them, finds the valves that lead outside, turns one off and another one on. WATER surges through the pipes, headed out to the far spigot. He turns to climb back up the ladder. And stops. He looks down, at the floor. It's dirt. He kicks at the dirt with his shoe, thinking. 
A FEW MINUTES LATER, the pick axe falls. Tom has brought all his tools into the basement and is now digging in the middle of the basement floor. The bare bulb throws his exaggerated shadow on the earthen walls. He works. 
EXT OUR BLOCK DAY It's quiet in the neighborhood. The CRUNCHING sound of Tom's pick axe falling echoes over the block. 
INT BASEMENT DAY Tom digs. The hole is almost four feet across, five feet deep. He's uncovered a large rock, a major chunk of stone, right in the middle of where he wants to dig. He's excavated all around the edges of the thing and is trying to wedge it loose with a pry bar, but it won't budge. Tom collapses onto the floor, leaning against the pile of mud and stone he's already hauled out. He thinks. 
CUT TO: 
INT YARD SUPPLY WAREHOUSE DAY Tom walks down an aisle along one wall in a huge yard supply warehouse. Tools are mounted on the wall for sale -- shovels, picks, post hole diggers. Got all that. Tom keeps walking. The tools get bigger. Huge shovels. Tractor blades. Hand pile drivers. Almost, but not quite. Tom keeps walking. At the end of the row, underneath a sign that says "FOR RENTAL ONLY" is an industrial-size jackhammer, the kind road crews use to bust through whatever's in their way. Tom's face lights up. 
EXT STREET DAY The jackhammer rides in the back of Tom's pickup truck, rattling along as the truck bounces over potholes. Tom pulls into his driveway, comes around, and drops the gate. Using all his strength, he wrestles the jackhammer out of the back of the truck. It's incredibly heavy, it takes all his strength to haul it up the stairs, kick open his door, and bring it into the house. 
IN THE STREET, Lenny, the neighborhood crank, is washing his car. He hears a CRASH from over at Tom's place and turns. He sees Tom at his pickup, lugging a huge air compressor out of it. Tom fights his way into the house with the compressor. Lenny stares at him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Sheila, carrying flowers and looking like didn't sleep last night, comes out of her house and heads for her car. She stops and stares too. 
INT BASEMENT DAY In Tom's basement, the compressor descends through the trap door above, seemingly of its own accord -- than we see it's at the end of a rope and Tom is up in the trap door space, sweating and straining, lowering the thing down. It settles on the floor next to the jackhammer. 
A BIT LATER, Tom reaches up to the hanging light bulb, which also has an electrical outlet in its fixture, and plugs in a yellow safety cord. He flicks a switch on the compressor and it RATTLES to life. He follows a hose over to where it plugs into the side of the jackhammer, which now quivers with unleashed power. Tom picks up the jackhammer. He hauls it over to the rock that's been in his way. He positions the jackhammer's spike on the top of the rock. He lowers a pair of goggles over his eyes. He swings his weight up, onto the jackhammer, and squeezes the handles. The jackhammer ROARS to life. It's deafening. Tom's whole body quivers. It's like riding a bull, but the rock begins to split in half. Tom WHOOPS with joy, barely heard over the din that echoes in his basement. 
EXT STREET DUSK As the sun goes down, the sound of the ROARING jackhammer is plainly audible on the block. The familiar Homeless Guy stops and SHOUTS something at Tom's house. Across the street, Kurt Damon comes out his front door and stares at Tom's house. What the hell is that guy up to? 
CUT TO: 
INT UNCLE STEVE'S HOUSE NIGHT A group of PEOPLE IN DARK CLOTHES mill around a living room, muttering in the soft tones of those at a wake.

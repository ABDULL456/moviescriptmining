141 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-NIGHT 
DARTH SIDIOUS stands alone in his private office, illuminated only from a hologram projector beam from above. A small HOLOGRAM OF COMMANDER GREE stands in front of him. 
CLONE COMMANDER GREE: Yes, My Lord. 
DABTH SIDIOUS: The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six. 
142 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL BALCONY-DAY 
A vista of waterways, high green mesas, and giant tree cities serves as a backdrop for the fierce battle, CLONES AND WOOKIEES against TRADE FEDERATION DROID ARMIES, with treaded tank-like vehicles. CLONE COMMANDER GREE holds his comlink. 
CLONE COMMANDER GREE: It will be done, My Lord. 
CLONE COMMANDER GREE snaps his comlink shut. 
YODA watches from the balcony. The battle rages as CLONES and WOOKIEES attack DROIDS coming across the water on CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS. CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL stand on either side of the Jedi Master as he watches the battle below. CLONE COMMANDER GREE and ONE OFFICER walk onto the balcony toward YODA. YODA stands looking over the battlefield below. When they are close enough, the CLONES reveal their weapons and fire. 
But faster than the CLONES can reveal their weapons, YODA ignites his lightsaber, leaps in the air, and beheads both CLONES. CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL fire their weapons as more CLONES enter the hall. The Wookiees call out to YODA to follow them. CHEWBACCA picks YODA up and carries him away. 
143 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-NIGHT 
A JEDI is surrounded and gunned down by CLONE TROOPERS. 
144 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-NIGHT 
ANAKIN walks through the Jedi Temple, where he finds and kills SHAAK TI. He exits Shaak Ti's room and enters a hallway, where the battle is taking place. 
145 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BATTLE-NIGHT 
ANAKIN enters a room full of YOUNGLINGS huddled in a corner. 
YOUNGLINGS: Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do? 
ANAKIN looks back at them with a stern expression on his face and ignites his lightsaber. 
146 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-PRE-DAWN 
C-3PO and PADME look out the apartment window. 
C-3PO: The Chancellor's office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi Temple. Don't worry, My Lady. I am sure he will be all right. 
PADME bursts into tears. 
147 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN 
The city planet is covered in a hazy glow. A column of black smoke can be seen rising in the distance. BAIL ORGANA's Speeder flies overhead, straight toward the smoke. 
148 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-LANDING PLATFORM-PRE-DAWN 
The Jedi Temple is on fire. Large plumes of smoke billow toward the sky as BAIL ORGANA lands his Speeder on a Jedi Temple platform. FOUR CLONE TROOPERS stand guard at the entrance to the Temple. They lower their guns as BAIL gets out of his Speeder and walks toward them. 
BAIL ORGANA: What's going on here?!? 
CLONE SERGEANT: There's been a rebellion. Don't worry, sir, the situation is under control. 
The CLONES bar the Senator from entering the Temple. 
CLONE SERGEANT: (continuing) I'm sorry, sir. No one is allowed entry. 
The CLONES point their guns at BAIL and cock them. 
CLONE SERGEANT: (continuing) It's time for you to leave, sir. 
BAIL ORGANA: And so it is. 
BAIL reluctantly heads hack toward his Speeder. Suddenly, several SHOTS RING OUT. BAIL turns and sees a ten-year-old Jedi, ZETT JUKASSA, fighting the CLONES. Several more CLONES join in the fight, followed by CLONE COMMANDER APPO (1119), who points at BAIL. 
CLONE COMMANDER APPO: Get him! Shoot him! 
SEVERAL CLONES start firing at BAIL. The Senator jumps for cover behind his Speeder, starting the engines and pulling out his laser pistol. 
The YOUNG JEDI cuts down several CLONES, including APPO, before he is overrun and shot. 
The Speeder takes off with BAIL clinging to the side. The CLONES fire at it as it disappears into the cityscape. 
149 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN 
BAIL ORGANA struggles to pull himself into the Speeder as it races along through the cityscape. Finally, he climbs in, just as the Speeder is about to hit a building. BAIL steers clear of the building and races away. 
150 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER SINKHOLE-DAY 
The Jedi dives below the surface amid a barrage of laser fire. He dives deeper under the water, fumbling in his utility belt for a breathing device. He finds it and puts it in his mouth. He swims underwater until the CLONE TROOPS give up and stop filing. 
151 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER CAVES-DAY 
OBI-WAN removes the breathing apparatus after coming up from underwater. He starts to climb the rock wall. 
OBI-WAN climbs the wall to the second cave just as TWO LITTLE SEEKER DRONES pop out of the water with their searchlights glowing. OBI-WAN presses himself against the wall of the smaller cave as the TWO SEEKER DRONES search the grotto. One of the SEEKERS begins to enter the cave in which OBI-WAN is hiding. OBI-WAN presses further into the wall. The light shines on the opposite wall and moves to the back of the cave, illuminating a huge NOS MONSTER. OBI-WAN holds his breath. The SEEKER is confused for a moment, then the NOS MONSTER lunges at the SMALL DROID and consumes it in one bite. 
The NOS MONSTER'S lunge takes him past OBI-WAN, out of the cave, and into the water. 
The SECOND SEEKER shines its light on the NOS MONSTER as the evil creature tries to grab the LITTLE DRONE. OBI-WAN slinks off toward the back of the cave. He comes upon a nest of BABY NOS MONSTERS. They SCREECH and make horrible sounds. OBI-WAN jumps over them and continues on his way through the tunnel system. 
152 EXT. KASHYYYK-LAKE ON VILLAGE EDGE-DUSK 
CLONES in modified one-man AT-ST's and Swamp Speeders flash their searchlights across the gloomy lake. The light of one of the AT-ST's spots something floating in the water. It is what's left of a Wookiee catamaran. The body of a dead Wookiee (TARFFUL) is lying across the stern of the wreckage of the flying boat. There is some movement on the boat. The CLONE SERGEANT on the AT-ST fires a warning shot past the boat.

No answer. Clarkson looks to Kathy to take control. She turns to her group, but they have even less respect for her. She goes to speak, when... VIKO, 25, looks up, hesitant. TWB 18. 
VIKO (BROKEN ENGLISH) I will take it. 
The cops turn. Clarkson unclicks his pen. Viko sees Kathy, hungry for support. But Danik scoffs. 
DANIK (BOSNIAK) (At Zlata) Tze ye yiyiy vuna. 
Zlata's face tightens. Viko turns to Danik, angry.... Kathy looks to Clarkson, who gives her nothing. 
KATHY What did he say? 
VIKO She is Muslim. He said she deserved it. 
CLARKSON Alright, that's it. Everyone out. 
KATHY (at Clarkson) Isn't she filing a complaint? 
The other cops eye Kathy, defiant. This is our turf. 
Clarkson ushers the cops out. Kathy catches Viko's eye. Simpatico. Then follows the other out. Kathy looks back at Zlata, who lies helpless. 
33   INT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER                       33 
Clarkson leads the group. Kathy pushes up toward him. 
KATHY She has to file a complaint. A woman gets stabbed in the face and there are no repercussions? 
Clarkson pulls Kathy aside. Viko stares. 
CLARKSON Quit it! You hear me? 
Kathy reddens. The local cops look over. 
CLARKSON (CONT'D) We are not investigators. We are monitors. You don't know a Serb from a Croat or a Bosniak. You've got ethnic hatreds that started a war. This isn't just policing, it's diplomacy. TWB 19. 
Kathy blushes, feeling like a chastened schoolgirl. 
CLARKSON (CONT'D) We don't run the show, we make sure the show runs smoothly. 
34   INT. BEDROOM - IPTF DORM - EVENING                             34 
Kathy sits up in bed reading from her Dyncorp/UN manual. She flicks, not finding what she's looking for. Carmen comes out of her room, dolled up for the evening. 
CARMEN Come out. You can't solve this tonight. I'm not taking no for an answer. 
35   EXT. LOCAL CAFE - SARAJEVO MARKET - NIGHT                      35 
Kathy has dinner with Carmen, who talks away. Kathy watches the world go by. She notices an OLDER, LARGE IPTF MONITOR walking with his arm around a YOUNG GIRL, 16, dressed in a short skirt. Kathy turns back to Carmen who is still talking. 
36   EXT. SARAJEVO - MORNING                                        36 
Chanting echoes from the SINANOVA HOUSE of the Dervish Order. 
37   INT. ILIDZA STATION - MORNING                                  37 
Viko comes in, scanning over IPTF MONITORS. Spotting Kathy. 
38   INT. ILIDZA STATION - MOMENTS LATER                            38 
Viko lays down a pile of files. Zlata's picture on top. 
VIKO Zlata Sehik has been to the hospital eight time because of her husband. Every time she try to file a complaint, my bosses send her back. They always laugh at the woman... They laughed at my mother. They do not make prosecutions of domestic violence. I want to get enough evidence to do this. 
Kathy isn't sure. She looks around, almost guiltily... 
VIKO (CONT'D) This is why you are here, no? 
Kathy looks at him, struck by the truth of this. She takes the files, flipping through them. Thinking... TWB 20. 
KATHY With no police reports?.. Maybe, if you go back to the hospital... You can pull the records for every one of her visits. 
39   INT. FILE ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAY                               39 
A HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR, who hands Viko a stack of files. 
40   EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                           40 
Kathy sits in a UN SUV. Viko watches as she goes through Zlata's hospital files. She's encouraged. 
KATHY Okay, now get the same thing from all the doctors who treated her. They will have to testify on Zlata's behalf. 
41   INT. LAW LIBRARY - EVENING                                    41 
Viko and Kathy sit behind a pile of Legal Books. Viko shows Kathy a page, a questioning look on his face. 
KATHY This is good. Let's cross reference each injury with other cases where felony assaults were ruled. Can you get something like that? 
Viko turns to see a LIBRARIAN at the main desk. 
KATHY (CONT'D) ... Because if stabbing someone in a bar is illegal then the same standard can be applied to a domestic assault. 
42   INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY                                         42 
Viko sits behind Zlata and COUNSEL while a JUDGE rules.

SKAT Workmen in the forest. Oh, well! (sings) The terrible night doesn't frighten me ... (speaks) Hey, what the devil ... it's my tree they're cutting down. 
He peers through the foliage. Below him stands a dark figure diligently sawing away at the base of the tree. SKAT becomes frightened and angry. 
SKAT Hey, you! Do you hear me, you tricky bastard? What are you doing with my tree? 
The sawing continues without a pause. SKAT becomes more frightened. 
SKAT Can't you at least answer me? Politeness costs so little. Who are you? 
DEATH straightens his back and squints up at him. SKAT cries out in terror. 
DEATH I'm sawing down your tree because your time is up. 
SKAT It won't do. I haven't got time. 
DEATH So you haven't got time. 
SKAT No, I have my performance. 
DEATH Then it's canceled because of death. 
SKAT My contract. 
DEATH Your contract is terminated. 
SKAT My children, my family. 
DEATH Shame on you, Skat! 
SKAT Yes, I'm ashamed. 
DEATH begins to saw again. The tree creaks. 
SKAT Isn't there any way to get off? Aren't there any special rules for actors? 
DEATH No, not in this case. 
SKAT No loopholes, no exceptions? 
DEATH saws.

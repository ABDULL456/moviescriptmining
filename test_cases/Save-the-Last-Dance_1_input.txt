SERIOUS STUDENT I want to be a lawyer, but I believe in God so I'm not sure about it...

TONI I'm moving to Idaho.      I hate it here.

CHENILLE (CONT'D) I'm a year behind 'cause of my baby, but I'm gonna work during the day, go to school at night. That's my plan anyway... 
106   MALAKAI                                                       106

NIKKI I get into U.M.B.C., financial aid, everything... 
MRS. GWYNN Do I detect a 'but'? 
Nikki folds her arms, regards her obdurately. 
MRS. GWYNN I know you're -- how do you put it? -- Large here, Nikki. You enjoy that and it's fine for now. I guess. But you can't live your life like a popularity contest.

walking in.     Sitting down. 
SARA I don't think it's realistic, what you're asking. Things happen. Things change. And the changes change you. What's the point of plans? 
MRS. GWYNN To have a sense of direction. 
SARA You can't direct destiny.

MRS. GWYNN (fingering Sara's papers) I see here that you trained for Juilliard, that you auditioned. 
SARA That was a long time ago. 
MRS. GWYNN It was three months ago, Sara. (the brick wall) Well, if you're not going to pursue dance, what are you going to do? 
SARA (hadn't thought about it) I don't know. Take a year off. Work. Go to college later on. 
MRS. GWYNN Be careful with later on, Sara. It's a slippery slope. Sometimes you can run right on top of it and it never catches up with you. 
109   EXT. O'DONNELL HEIGHTS - ROOFTOP - LATE DAY                   109 
A low sun over the cityscape of Baltimore. PUSH IN ON Patrick and Sara, two dots that grow larger. He CLICKS ON a BOOM-BOX resting on the roof's ledge. A hip-hop track BLASTS. 
PATRICK Feel the groove. Don't let the music mess with you. 
He starts to move with the music. Sara tries to emulate him. They dance throughout the conversation. 
SARA Did you always want to be a doctor? 
PATRICK Who said I wanna be a doctor? 
SARA Chenille.   Everybody. 
He cinches her waist, pushes in her ass.

PATRICK Keep it tight.     Watch your butt. 
SARA What kind of doctor do you want to be? 
PATRICK Pediatrics. I like kids.         Come on, stay with me. You're slackin'. 
SARA Do you have any? Kids. 
PATRICK No.   Do you?

Josh carries him up the stairs as he sucks in sobs. 
Renai glances around the basement, her eyes landing on the lone object that resides in it. 
She frowns. It wasn't there when she saw the basement last. 
It is a box. One of her large, cardboard moving boxes. 
It is marked LAMPS. 
INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Dalton is lying in bed, a band-aid slapped across his forehead. Renai tucks him in, Josh standing over him. 
JOSH You're lucky you don't need stitches. 
RENAI If I catch you falling down the stairs again I'm gonna break your neck. 
DALTON That doesn't make sense. 
There are dozens of pictures tacked to the wall, all drawn by Dalton. Josh taps one; a drawing of Dalton flying through the night sky, wearing his cape. 
DALTON (CONT'D) You might be a superhero but you're not invincible. Be more careful, bud. 
Renai kisses him and gets up. 
RENAI Sleep tight, honey. 
They wave goodbye and turn out the light. 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Renai flops into bed beside Josh, exhausted. 
JOSH We've gotta lock that door. 
RENAI He's such a boy. He goes off exploring. Sometimes I wanna keep him on one of those child leashes. 
JOSH Why bother with a child leash? I'll stop at the pet store tomorrow. 
She laughs and cuddles up to him, resting her head on his chest. 
RENAI I'm sorry I was pissy when you got home. I was trying to work on a song today and then Cali woke up and wouldn't stop crying... 
JOSH I didn't even notice. 
RENAI I feel guilty for wanting my own time. 
JOSH It's normal to want your own time. 
RENAI Is it? My mother gave up everything for me. I keep waiting for the completely selfless parent gene to kick in, but I'm exactly the same person I was when I was 22, only now I'm married with kids. 
JOSH You're a great mother. 
RENAI No, I'm not. They like you so much better than me. 
JOSH That's not true. 
RENAI You're the cool dad who comes home with presents and I'm the one who yells at them all day. 
JOSH Now you're being crazy. They love you. At least you get to connect with them. I work so much. 
RENAI Believe me, you're their hero. They try to play us off against each other. They're master manipulators. I guess they really are my kids. 
Josh laughs. A lull settles over them. 
RENAI (CONT'D) Is this it, Josh? 
JOSH Is this so bad? 
She doesn't answer. They sit in silence for a long beat. 
RENAI Thank you for letting me take some time off to work on my music again. 
JOSH We'll get by. I want you to do it. 
RENAI There's a couple of songs...I mean not all of them, but there's a couple of them that I think are really good. And I think, maybe I could do something with them. 
JOSH I love all your songs. 
They kiss. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
It is 3AM. All the remoteness of that hour is present here...we can feel it. 
As still and quiet as deep space.

LAYMAN (OC) Two, Tibet's defenses must be handled by China. Three, all political and trade matters concerning foreign countries must be conducted through China. 
A voice shouts out: 
VOICE IN BACK OF ROOM (OC) Give the Dalai Lama his majority! 
INT.  GREAT HALL  DAY 
The senior Monk is on his knees. 
MONK We can concede that Tibet is a part of China if we can guarantee that the Dalai Lama's name and authority will remain... 
LAYMAN And do you believe that the Tibetan government will be allowed to continue to function as it is? Do you believe that our religion will be protected? 
VOICES Give the Dalai Lama his majority! 
MONK We have dealt with this Chinese obsession for hundreds of years. We can deal with it now. 
LAYMAN These are not the Chinese we know. These are Communists. 
VOICES Make him Dalai Lama now! 
We see the Lord Chamberlain look toward the open door. 
INT.  HALLWAY  DAY 
Tenzin Gyatso looks at his advisor, and then, he closes the door as the demand for his enthronement continues. 
He walks down the hall, past the door leading to the treasure room, alone now - an adult.  He is wearing those European, lace-up shoes found in the treasure room so long ago.  They are still too big for him. 
EXT.  TRIBUTARY OF THE KYICHU RIVER, NORBULINKA  DAY 
Tenzin Gyatso and Taktra Rinpoche walk side by side along the waterway. 
TENZIN GYATSO If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost. 
TAKTRA RINPOCHE What would you do, Holiness? 
The boy looks out over the water. 
Shepherds are leading their flock of sheep back toward town on the far side of the tributary. 
The two men stand side by side, one so young, one seeming so old. 
TENZIN GYATSO What should I do about my doubt, Teacher? 
TAKTRA RINPOCHE It is a difficult situation. 
TENZIN GYATSO I mean, my doubt.  Why me? Am I Him? 
TAKTRA RINPOCHE Doubt is an affliction.  Reliquish it.  Accept. 
Pause. 
TENZIN GYATSO I believe we must make no concesions to the Chinese.  But, I am one voice. The Dalai Lama has always trusted in the forces of Buddha.  Let us consult the protective deities. 
Taktra Rinpoche bows and leaves him. 
Tenzin Gyatso stands alone by the river.  The boy watches the herders, and before the young shepherds disappear from sight, the Dalai Lama turns and waves a hand behind him. 
Two Bodyguards approach.  We can not hear, but as the Dalai Lama walks away from us, down the river, one Bodyguard runs up river, shouting: 
BODYGUARD (shouting) We will buy them!  We will buy them! 
INT.  ALTAR ROOM, NORBULINKA  DAY 
In this black room, under the protective view of the statue of Mahakala, a divine lottery is performed. 
Tenzin Gyatso, the Regent Taktra Rinpoche, The Lord chamberlain, the Kashag, the Yigstang and the Tsitang are all present. 
Tsampa-dough balls are made, three of them, each containing a strip of parchment, bearing writing.  The dough is shaped and weighed to see that each ball is equal. 
Then, the three balls are placed in a silver bowl and the bowl is spun.  The balls whirl, race, and finally one leaps from the bowl. 
This ball is taken to the Dalai Lama and he makes a mark on it.  The ball is returned to the bowl, the procedure is repeated, and a ball leaps again, almost immediately.  This ball is presented and the Dalai Lama places his mark - next to the mark he just made.  It is the same ball. 
Tenzin Gyatso makes the twelfth mark on the same ball, and the spinning begins again and then the thirteenth mark, and then the ball is broken open and the strip of parchment handed to the Regent. 
TAKTRA RINPOCHE We should not accept any conditions from the Chinese. 
EXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  DAY 
In a paved area, adjacent to the Yellow Wall which marks the Dalai Lama's private grounds, the Opera Festival has begun. 
This festival involves performances by Tibetan singers, dancers and actors.  It looks to be a joyous occasion; officials and their wives are dressed in their finest and sit before beautifully laid picnics.  Children run here and there, amidst the monks and nomads, the swashbuckling Khambas from eastern Tibet (large people, with heavy braids wrapped in red cloth on top of their heads).  There are westerners, Nepalese and Sikimese. 
Dancers - dressed in wild, colorful outfits - spin and leap in time to the eerie, Tibetan music.

BRYCE reaches the surface and CLYDE tries to throw him into deeper water.  He hitches BRYCE over a moldy skiff, knocking aside one of the oars.  BUCK upends BRYCE into the skiff and kicks it spinning.  CLYDE picks up an oar and hurls it like a boomerang, ass over end at the skiff.  It kicks up a spray. 
BUCK (holding tightly to Clyde, yelling) I got the PICTURE! 
Reaction.  CLYDE waist deep, breathing heavily. 
CLYDE ...All right, all right... (to Bryce, yelling) WE GOT YOU...HEAR?... REMEMBER... YOU... YOUR FACE...WE GOT IT...WE GOT YOU...WE GOT YOU...WE GOT YOU... 
BRYCE, battered and handcuffed, stares back with mindless malice from the lazily spinning skiff to the hysterical spectre of CLYDE, screaming his madness across the water. 
DISSOLVE: 
INT. BANK. 
Inside the bank.  In contrast to the previous inept bank robbery scene, this one goes admirably well, the gang performing slickly and without a hitch.  As they enter, dripping wet, CLYDE makes a general announcement to everyone to the bank. 
CLYDE This is the Barrow gang. (the people turn and freeze) Everybody just take it easy and nobody will get hurt. 
CLYDE covers the door.  BONNIE and BUCK go to the tellers' cages and get money.  BUCK goes inside, emptying out the cash drawers.  Cut to BONNIE filling the sack. 
Cut to a close-up of a burglar alarm button.  Slowly a hand crawls up the wall and a finger slowly moves to push the button.  When the finger is about one inch away, suddenly a gun appears in the frame and gently taps the hand away.  The camera pulls back to reveal BUCK smiling at a lady teller. 
BUCK Don't do nothin' silly now. 
Cut to CLYDE standing near the door, training his guns on the entire bank.  A farmer stands a few feet away, some bills clutched in his hand. 
CLYDE That your money or the bank's? 
FARMER Mine. 
CLYDE Keep it, then. 
Across the floor, the bank guard in the corner takes advantage of CLYDE's distraction to go for his gun.  CLYDE spots it and fires a shot that just knocks the bank guard's hat off without harming him. 
CLYDE (to the guard, who has practically frozen in fear) Next time I'll aim a little lower. 
They finish robbing the bank.  They start to exit.  Near the door stands a guard with his hands raised.  He wears sun glasses of the period.  As they leave BUCK snatches the sun glasses from the guard's head. 
BUCK Get a good look at us!  We're the Barrow boys. 
EXT. BANK.  DAY. 
The gang runs wildly into the street where the car waits, motor running.  As they leap into car, BUCK throws the sun glasses into BLANCHE's lap. 
BUCK Happy birthday. 
They zoom off.  Shots are heard.  BONNIE, BUCK and CLYDE begin firing at the bank guards who are pursuing them.  The guards fire back. 
Close-up.  BLANCHE sitting in the back seat with her fingers stuck tightly in her ears, eyes shut, trying to overcome her panic.  A funny image, but one that also awakens pity.  The next sequence is carried out in cross-cutting. 
CUT TO: 
The street in front of the bank.  Police car pulls up and the excited crowd gestures in the direction of the departed gang.  The siren starts. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GANG CAR.  DAY. 
The siren heard now in the far distance. 
BUCK (to C.W. at the wheel) Kick it in the pants, C.W. 
CLYDE We got to make that state line! 
C.W. (driving like a wild man, but adlibing loudly) Can't get more'n this out of a Plymouth! 
CUT TO: 
INT. BANK. 
The gang has left a legacy of celebrity behind.  We see the bank guard whose hat was shot off being interviewed by a reporter.  He is seated in a chair, his shirt open at the collar and a woman teller is fanning him. 
BANK GUARD (enjoying the limelight) Then he saw me goin' for my gun. Clyde Barrow himself, I mean.  And suddenly I was starin' into the face of death!

{"train": "Alien III Screenplay by John Fasano Story by Vincent Ward & John Fasano \nFIRST DRAFT March 29, 1990 \n\"But how will you die when your time comes, Narcissus, since you have no mother?  Without a mother, one cannot love.  Without a mother, one cannot die.\" \n- Hesse \nALIEN III \nTHE SCREEN IS BLACK \nA pinpoint of light appears. Red.  An ember. Unseen BELLOWS blow. \nGLASS FURNACE \nThe embers glow.  Flame. The fire GROWS. \nA RIVER OF MOLTEN GLASS \nHeated by the furnace to over 1,300 degrees fahrenheit. White Hot. \nGLASS FACTORY \nFlickering flame casts dancing shadows on wooden walls. Coarsely grained wood.  Moisture blasted out by years of intense heat.  Timbers split.  Patched with new wood, it too now old and dry. \nSMOKE \nBillows up the walls. Hangs as an angry, black cloud amongst the rafters and beams of the vaulted ceiling.  Almost obscures -- \nA MAN \nOn a narrow LEDGE, twenty feet about the Glassworks' floor. His clothing is Medieval.  A rough textured cassock. He is a MONK. \nLOUVERS are set into the wall.  He angles them open. The smoke begins to escape. \nThe Monk turns, raises arms and LEAPS from his lofty perch -- Gently gliding down to the floor with the aid of a FLOWING FOX -- a primitive hand-held pulley that runs down a rope. He lands next to the glass furnace, surrounded by -- \nMORE MONKS \nBy their dress.  With Blowing Iron and Pontil. They blow and shape the molten glass.  Crack off the finished pieces.  The old way. \nONE PARTICULAR MONK \nBlack skinned, early fifties. Stirs his five foot long blowing iron in the molten glass, but he is watching something else.  It moves him to song. Lilting tenor lifts high into the air. This is BROTHER KYLE. \nBROTHER KYLE Well would he guess the ascending of the star, Wherein his patient's fortunes settled were. He knew the course of every malady, Were it of cold or heat or moist or dry. Brother John, would-be Doctour of Physick. \nWe see the object of his song: \nBROTHER JOHN \nNot yet forty.  Strong features, but fear behind the eyes. The fear that comes from a lack of inner confidence. A good face, nonetheless. He stirs a thick mixture in a mortar. Next to him another MONK sits holding his arm out in front of him, cassock sleeve rolled up, revealing a vicious BURN. \nBROTHER KYLE Tend you quickly he will, with bottles from a shelf. But heals not, so easily, The ills which plague himself. \nBrother John stops stirring. \nBROTHER JOHN (to Kyle) Enough. \nHe scoops the salve out with his fingers and applies it to the Burned Monk's arm.  The Burned Monk INHALES sharpley as the cool mixture contacts the injured area. \nBROTHER JOHN (to the burned Monk) Relax. (to Kyle) Put those lungs of yours to better use. \nBROTHER KYLE Yes, Doc Tor. \nKyle laughs, removes the blowing iron from the molten glass -- a BLOB of white hot glass hanging on the end. \nHe rolls the blob on the Marver, a flat, polished piece of iron, then begins to blow a bottle shaped container. \nJohn wraps a fray-edged cloth bandage around the burn. \nJOHN Keep this from getting wet.  Go home at late afternoon mealtime and don't come back to work today -- \nBURNED MONK But John -- \nJOHN I'll tell the Abbot.  Just rest today. You're lucky you only burned yourself on the side of the furnace.  If some of that glass had gotten on your arm -- \nHe points to the top of his forearm. \nJOHN Brother Philip. \nPHILIP Feeding the mind instead of the body again? \nJOHN My training has taught me to feed what's hungry. \nPhilip pats his broad stomach and heads down the hallway. \nPHILIP As did mine.  As long as you're alone. Enjoy yourself -- and remember, no book leaves the library. \nJOHN How could I forget?  Have a good meal... \nJohn watches the corpulent librarian head down the stairs. When he's gone from sight John lifts the bottom of his cassock to reveal Mattias. \nJOHN Perfect. \nThey move into the library... \nTHE MEDIEVAL SECTION \nThe oldest books. John moves to the stacks. Mattias trots over to a particular bench and sits. This is his regular place. \nAT THE SHELVES \nJohn stands on toe tips to retrieve an ancient Tome. He runs his fingers over the familiar leather binding. A smile plays across his lips. \nHe carries the book, places it on the edge of the table so there is slack in the chain. Sits on the bench next to the dog. Clears his throat, opens the book, begins to read... \nJohn (reading) In the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks -- \nVOICE O/S Sometimes, I think you'd like that. \nJohn turns to find -- \nTHE ABBOT \nLeader of the monastery.  In his seventies but looks younger. His Cassock is adorned with a large, ornately carved, wooden CHAIN in place of a rope belt.  He crosses to the table. \nJohn closes the book and stands, head bowed in respect. \nJohn Abbot, I -- I didn't think anyone would -- \nABBOT Mind?  Just Philip, if he knew.  I passed him on the way up.  He said you'd come in alone.  I knew better. \nHe scratches the back of Mattias' neck. \nABBOT Hello, Mattias.  How are you, boy? \nThe dog snuffles in response. \nABBOT You know what Philip says about Mattias' hair and his breathing.  You'll have to take him out of here. \nJOHN He likes when I read to him and -- I can't -- \nJohn looks down sheepishly.  Though nearly forty, he feels almost adolescent in the presence of the Abbot. The Abbot pulls a large key from his pocket. \nABBOT (smiles) Someone must have left this one unlocked. Take the book with you. \nHe hands the key to John, who is shocked -- this is a great honor. \nJOHN Father, I --? \nABBOT Kyle tells me you did a good job at the glassworks today. \nJOHN I'll reserve judgement until the patient lives. \nJohn crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book. He returns the key. \nABBOT It will get easier.  Father Anselm was... an unexpected loss.  You'll do fine. \nThe Abbot walks towards the door... \nABBOT Just have it back before the end of lunch. Oh -- And I didn't see you in here. \nJOHN Thank you. (to Mattias) Let's go upstairs, boy. \nJohn takes his book -- Moves to a spiral wooden staircase. Mattias at his heels. Goes UP -- \nINTO THE BELL TOWER \nHe smiles at her. Friendly, not sexual. \nRIPLEY \nShakes her head.  Tries to speak -- Her lips form soundless words. She looks over her other shoulder, sees -- \nTHE SHIP - RIPLEY POV \nBobbing on the surface. Growing small with each stroke of the oars. \nRIPLEY \nBrows knit.  Fights the cobwebs in her brain. Tries to focus on the ship -- Remembers. Turns to John, tries to speak -- \nRIPLEY Wait.  New... \nShe loses consciousness. \nGO TO BLACK... \nINT. THE ABBEY - RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY \nStreaks of light move across the darkness. Form patterns of light and shadow against the wooden walls. There is a sublime stillness, but coming through the walls are the muted, far off SOUNDS of the Abbey -- The SAWING of wood.  HAMMERING. WHISPERED prayers. LILTING song. \nWe move down off the wall to a hand-made wooden bed. Ripley in restless sleep. \nEXT. ARCEON SEA - DUSK \nThe waters grown rough with the approach of night.  Wind whips across white wave tops -- SPRAYS the dozen Monks who LASH their boats to Ripley's SHIP with thick hemp ropes -- Start to tow it to shore... \nINT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nRipley is sleeping -- but struggling against some unseen foe -- She tries to sit up -- can't.  Tries to shake off the effects of the suspended animation...looks up through half-lidded eyes: \nJOHN \nSits next to her.  Quite asleep. Hands swathed in white bandages.  Book resting on his lap. \nShe squints to make the figure standing in the shadows behind him -- it's skin picks up and reflects tiny points of flickering cangle light - seems to ripple as it moves -- \nTHE ALIEN \nBig, black shiny-smooth head moves into the taper light. It moves towards her, cable-like arms held out at its side -- moving out of sync with its feet -- Ripley tries to move - to cry out -- She can't. \nShe can only move her eyes.  She looks over at John, sleeping peacefully.  He doesn't notice the Alien -- \nThe Alien moves closer. She can feel his breath -- it evaporates the sweat  on her forehead -- a CHILL runs through her but she still can't move -- \nThe Alien stands alongside her bed. Extends a six-fingered hand... Gently rests it on her stomach. Cocks its head -- like it's listening to something. The implication is clear. \nRipley finds her voice -- \nRIPLEY AAAAAAAAAAAARGH! \nHer eyes open wide -- She sits bolt upright. \nA hand moves to her forehead.  Gently pushes her head back to the pillow.  John's. \nJOHN You're out of it.  Out of it... \nRipley falls back, eyes glued to where the alien appeared. John sees her focal point, looks back over his shoulder: Nothing. Ripley's eyes roll back into her head. She tries to speak -- It was there. Her hand, at her side, tightens into a fist -- \nJohn's hand covers hers. Eases the fingers open again. She feels the coarse bandages against her palm. \nHe starts to read quietly from Saint Augustines' Confessions. She begins to drowse again as his soft voice flows over her like waves lapping against the shore... \nEXT. SURGACE OF ARCEON - DAY \nA HOWLING DUST STORM has kicked up.  The monks wear small round goggles, have rags tied over their noses, as they work at a huge BLOCK AND TACKLE arrangement -- \nHundreds of ropes grow TAUT. Timbers GROAN. They LIFT Ripley's SHIP -- SWING it over to a large portal -- \nINT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY \nRipley lays with eyes closed. Muffled VOICES outside her door: \nABBOT How is the woman, John? \nJOHN I don't think she's here yet. \nRIPLEY (calculates) Loose for two days.  This planet could be overrun within the week. \nRipley grabs the Abbot by his cassock -- \nRIPLEY Look, there's a xenomorph -- (sees his confusion) An Alien creature.  A killer.  A monster. And now it's here. \nThe Abbot looks at her the way you look at that guy on the corner of Santa Monica and 3rd who's babbling about Judgement Day.  The guy with his pants down around his kness. \nShe sees this, releases her hold on him... RIPLEY Calm down, Ripley.  Okay, I was with a platoon of Colonial Marines on a mission to planetoid LV426.  We left Earth six months ago - maybe a year -- \nABBOT (interrupts) Wait a moment -- \nThe Abbot becomes aware of John's presence in the doorway. Turns over his shoulder at him. \nABBOT Leave us. \nJohn waits there a beat, then backs out and closes the door. \nABBOT Continue. \nRIPLEY We launched in the Cruiser Sulaco from Gateway sub-orbital space station -- \nABBOT Not possible. \nRIPLEY What do you mean? \nABBOT When we left Earth seventy years ago, it was on the brink of a New Dark Age. Technology was on the verge of destroying the planet's environment.  A computer virus was threatening to wipe away all recorded knowledge.  There didn't seem to be any way it could be averted.  In the almost forty years since we were towed out here in hypersleep, the news that came with occasional supply ships only got worse. Finally, the ships stopped coming.  We had to resign ourselves to the fact that worst had come to pass, and the Earth no longer existed. \nNow she gives him that look. RIPLEY (slowly) Uh...All right... Forget the Earth - How many people do you have here?  Let's worry about them.  Warn them -- \nA new look overtakes the Abbot's face.  A look of fear. Now she's getting to him - or is she? He abruptly stands. \nABBOT Your mind is troubled.  You need to rest some more. \nRIPLEY I don't need rest - I need to get to your people.  You've got to get to them -- tell them about the alien -- \nHe heads for the door -- \nABBOT I have had enough for now. \nRIPLEY Enough?  Didn't you hear what I said? It could wipe out the entire population of this planet.  It may have started already - Have there been any unusual deaths since I got here? \nThe Abbot stops in the door - \nABBOT No.  And there won't be. \nThe Abbot SLAMS the door behind him. \nTHE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY \nJohn stands nearby as the Abbot addresses two BURLY MONKS \nABBOT Bolt it. \nThe guards move to bolt the door. \nJOHN What is it -- What's wrong? \nABBOT Your patient is in a dangerous mental state.  Nobody gets in or out until I say so. \nJOHN But I.  Her meals -- \nABBOT Nobody. \nJOHN Father, I don't understand -- \nThe Abbot turns and disappears down the hall. John looks from the departing Abbot to the two Guard/Monks. \nTHE LIBRARY - NIGHT \nJohn has his head buried in his hands.  His back rises and falls with the rhythmic breathing of sleep. Mattias curled up on his feet.  Asleep as well. WHAM! The Library door FLIES open --! John sits bolt upright -- \nA HYSTERICAL MONK bursts in. Rushes to John's table. \nHYSTERICAL MONK Brother John!  You're here!  The Abbot said you'd -- I need -- you're the medic -- \nJOHN What?! \nHYSTERICAL MONK My Sandy -- she's ill -- \nIt TWISTS at the end of the fork, acid blood dripping onto the wood floor -- each drop bursting into a little pool of FIRE. \nThe Hysterical Monk turns to the now raging hay fire -- The entire corner of the barn is ablaze -- SHOVES the abomination in -- \nThe Sheep/Alien POPS and SIZZLES as tongues of flame leap up to lap at it's struggling body -- tiny tail whipping about -- \nThe creature dies, its fading screams are soon the only sound heard within the barn.  The Hysterical Monk holds his fork in the flame as he looks back to check on -- \nJOHN \nFace contorted, eyes glued to the burning creature.  Heaving lungs push air through his diaphram, but no sound comes from his open mouth -- The Doctor in training has seen the devil. \nEXT. HYSTERICAL MONK'S BARN - NIGHT \nWooden walls collapse inward as the building becomes a pyre. Acrid black smoke curls up to the ceiling and spreads out across the rafters... \nWe pull back from the sight INTO a window. Into \nINT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nRipley, watches the burning barn.  Frustrated, she climbs out of the bed on unsteady legs, wearing her tank top and shorts. Pulls on a coarse wollen cassock, ties the rope belt -- \nRIPLEY Idiots...I'll -- \nWHAM! The door BURSTS OPEN -- \nRIPLEY What the -? \nFour BURLY MONKS rush in and grab her. TEAR her out of bed -- \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nRipley is dragged down the darkened hallway. \nABBOT V.O. An evil has come to Arceon... \nIN THE TRIBUNAL ROOM - NIGHT \nAs he continues we move down a row of stern Monk faces, ending at the Abbots... \nABBOT You heard Brother Graham tell of the devil inside sheep's wool -- \nHe motions towards the Hysterical Monk, sitting in the crowd. \nABBOT An evil brought by this woman in her vessel of technology. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nA large circular room with wooden walls stretching thirty feet high.  Light creeps in through stained glass windows. \nHundreds of monks sits in a gallery that looms over the floor of the Tribunal.  On the floor: \nThe Abbot and the five eldest Monks sit at a long table facing the witness stand.  On the stand: \nRIPLEY \nConsiders the faces that surround her.  Fear.  Hate. \nRIPLEY This can't be happening. \nBALD TRIBUNAL MONK You have no voice in this tribunal. \nRIPLEY You must listen to me!  You're all in terrible danger!  It came with me on the ship -- \nABBOT We know that.  At first we believed its arrival was a good omen.  But it has only brought pestilence.  Dead sheep.  Dead fish. \nBALD TRIBUNAL MONK Evil. \nRipley turns to the Abbot. \nRIPLEY Yes, the ship brought it.  Not evil. It brought the Alien.  I told you, it's here. \nABBOT We know the name of the evil it brought. It brought technology.  Technology to destroy our planet, as surely as it destroyed the Earth. \nMONK IN AUDIENCE Destruction! \nRIPLEY I was on the Earth less than a year ago. It's still there.  People, cities, all still there! \nA murmur through the crowd.  Some are listening to her. The Abbot looks around.  He must be in command. \nJOHN Please, sir, let me finish.  I feel that there may be something to what she says. \nABBOT There isn't. \nThe Abbot moves to his table, begins to gather up his gavel, notebook.  John follows him -- \nJOHN I don't understand what you are doing. \nABBOT This colony is my responsibility.  I am protecting the colony. \nJOHN From what?  This woman?  You never gave her a chance.  How can you be so sure you're right? \nABBOT A better question is what makes you think I'm wrong? \nJOHN You didn't see this thing -- this demon -- Brother Graham and I -- we both saw it. \nABBOT (realizes) That's right.  You both did. (beat) And what was it? \nJOHN I -- I don't know what it was.  But I don't think Ripley was a party to it. \nABBOT She admits she brought it. \nJOHN But she tried to warn us -- \nABBOT You know that's how the devil works. Deception. \nJOHN But I believe her.  I don't know how to describe it -- A feeling. \nABBOT You haven't seen a woman in thirty years. Where does this feeling originate, John? \nJOHN (points to his head) Here. \nPause. \nABBOT I believe you.  But your feelings are fooling you. \nJOHN It's - It's her conviction.  I just think -- \nThe Abbot snaps at him -- \nABBOT Don't think. \nJohn takes a step back at the Abbot's tone.  A tone he's never heard before.  The Abbot runs a hand through his thinning hair. Forces a smile. \nABBOT It's been a long night.  For all of us. You really don't understand what you're dealing with here. \nJOHN That's what she said. \nThe Abbot chafes. \nABBOT These are ideas which threaten the very system we live under.  The creature is dead and the woman is gone.  Forget them. Both.  Go read.  Go fishing.  Go anywhere, but leave this alone. \nJOHN But I -- \nABBOT Alone.  I'll get Philip to let Mattias into the Library, all right?  For your own good, just stay out of this. \nJohn looks like he's going to protest. \nABBOT I mean it. \nJOHN (slowly) Yes, Father. \nJohn turns and leaves the room. The Abbot stares after him. \nINT. PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT \nDark. Dank. Dreary. A NAIL is hammered into a board.  Then another. The board is old, twisted.  The grain is pronounced, splintered. \nAnother board is lifted into place, a nail held -- BAM-BAM-BAM - HAMMERED in tight. \nTWO ANCIENT WORKERS \nDrab, torn gray clothing. Hammer the boards over the opening in the wall. Methodically covering up -- \nRIPLEY \nWatching them work. BAM-BAM-BAM. Defeated. \nON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY (INTERCUT) \nThe first golden rays of daylight filter through the huge stained glass windows.  John rapidly flips through the Medieval tome in front of him - past an illustration of Satan depicted as having a FACE on his ASS -- further still -- then stops. This is it. \nWe can't see what the illustration is, but we see his REACTION: \nHis eyes open wide as saucers.  SLAMS the book closed as if the image would strike blind.  He turns to Mattias as if to say something -- Decides not to wake the sleeping dog. \nJohn wraps the book's chain around his hand and puts one foot up against the shelf.  Pulls -- SPANKT! The old chain gives way. \nFace set, he loops the shoulder strap of his burlap medical bag over his shoulder.  Clutches the book to his chest, gently pets his sleeping dog and goes... \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ABBOT'S OFFICE - DAY \nJohn strides down the corridor purposefully but stops and flattens himself against the wall when the door to the Abbot's office opens suddenly -- \nBROTHER GRAHAM, The Hysterical Monk, is forcibly led from the room by two burly Monks, taken down the corridor in the other direction.  He is gagged.  A third Burly Monk moves out of the doorway with the Abbot. \nJOHN Now find John and have him brought to me immediately. \nTHIRD BURLY MONK Yes, Father. \nABBOT Start in the library.  And keep it quiet. \nThe Third Burly Monk nods and moves off. The Abbot watches him leave, then goes back into the room and closes the door.  John stares at the closed door a beat and then makes up his mind.  He turns and runs back down the hallway... \nINT. GLASS FACTORY - DAY \nThe first Monks straggle in for the morning shift. Kyle is among them.  He lifts his blowing iron from a wall mounted rack and moves towards the glass furnace as two other Monks begin to stoke the fire. \nJohn enters. Looks around the room and for a frantic moment cannot find -- \nKYLE \nAt the glass furnace.  About to dip his blowing iron into the MOLTEN GLASS.  John runs over to him. Almost knocks him over -- \nKYLE Hey!  Watch it! \nHe sees that John is agitated -- \nKYLE What?  What is it? \nThe other monks begin to notice the commotion, start moving in for a look... \nJOHN I -- Abbot.  Must -- \nJohn tries to catch his breath.  He gestulates wildly. Kyle puts down his blowing iron. \nKYLE John - relax.  Take a deep breath - Christ, now I sound like you -- \nHe sees the book clutched in John's white knuckled hands. \nKYLE Is that it, John?  Is it the book --? \nJOHN (panting) Yes.  Devil. \nKyle moves closer to him.  Cautiously. John sees the other monks gathering around -- Closing in on him - whispering -- \nWHISPERING MONKS He's got it... \nSECOND WHISPERING MONK Like the Comet Woman... \nTHIRD WHISPERING MONK He found her... WHISPERING MONK He's infected... \nJohn sees one of the Monks run out -- undoubtedly going to tell the Abbot.  John looks into his friend Kyle's face -- Fear. \nKYLE Everything's gonna be fine.  Now, let's see the -- \nJOHN Don't humor me -- I'm -- KYLE Sure.  Everything's gonna be fine... \nIf only he could explain - he can't. John YANKS the book away -- spins -- Bursts through the crowd... \nKYLE Wait -- JOHN! \nINT. SHAFT ROOM - DAY \nThe cage is still down, the ropes stretching into the abyss. John runs in.  Moves to the ropes.  Places the book on the floor. Tightens his scarred hands on the rope -- Mind racing: The woman will know.  Know what it is.  How to combat it. He PULLS -- \nThere's no tension against the ropes. John FALLS back on his ass. \nThe ropes WHIZ through the rusty pulley overhead. Pile on the floor in front of John. He lifts the end of the rope.  Stares: BITTEN THROUGH. \nRIPLEY Wherever I go. \nA HAND pushes a crust of bread through the hole. She opens her eyes to look at the food.  The White-Haired Man's head appears -- \nWHITE-HAIRED MAN Take it. \nRIPLEY Thanks, but no thanks, Anthony. \nShe knows his name. \nANTHONY You waiting for meat?  They don't bring me meat because they know I'm an android. Really don't need it.  Bread's better for you anyway.  Harder to digest, so it makes you feel fuller than you are. \nRIPLEY Not hungry. \nAnthony takes a bite. \nANTHONY Mmmm.  Just a little crunchy. \nRipley twists onto her back until she's staring up at the ceiling. \nRIPLEY Waste of time. \nANTHONY You don't eat, you'll starve to death, girl. \nRIPLEY That was the plan when they put me down here.  And why should you care? \nANTHONY Because I'm a synthetic person you don't think I can care? \nRIPLEY Believe me, that's a discussion you don't want to have with me. \nANTHONY You told me you had a bad experience and a good one with androids -- \nRIPLEY That's one of each.  That means you could go either way.  I'm tired of talking about this. \nHe pushes the bread towards her again. \nANTHONY You've still gotta eat.  You gotta fight the bastards -- \nRIPLEY I'm tired of fighting.  Maybe I'll be dead before he finds me.  Maybe he won't get the satisfaction. \nANTHONY He?  You make it sound like this Alien has a personal score to settle with you. The biology you describe:  Queen laying eggs, larvae, drone -- that's very insectoid.  Insects usually don't bear grudges. \nRIPLEY And Androids usually aren't the prisoners of lunatics that believe they're ancient Greeks. \nANTHONY Medieval Monks. \nRIPLEY Whatever. \nANTHONY And they've only chose to live the life style, they don't believe they're -- (hears something) What's that? \nRipley strains to listen.  In the distance: KNOCKING.  Someone is knocking on the walls. A VOICE calls out -- \nINT. PRISON LEVEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nJOHN (hoarse) Ripley! \nHe moves down the hallway. BANGS his fist against the walls every few feet -- Waits a moment for a reply, then moves on. \nINT. ANTHONY'S CELL \nAnthony gets off the floor - Moves so she can see into his cell: \nThe walls of Anthony's cell are covered with charcoal sketches - Different versions of demons and the devil.  She rolls her eyes - This guy is an Android! \nAnthony crosses to his cell door, peers through eye level. \nINT. PRISON LEVEL CORRIDOR HALLWAY - ANTHONY POV \nJohn coming towards him, knocking on the doors of boarded up cells. \nANTHONY Hey -- you knocking -- cut it out -- You're going to wake everybody up. \nJohn moves to Anthony's door.  Looks at him through the slot. Anthony recognizes him. \nANTHONY Brother John? \nJohn unbolts Anthony's door. Picks him up by his cassock -- \nJOHN Anthony?  Thought you dead fifteen years. \nJOHN Yes.  I mean no.  I mean, that was part of it.  Look.  I never thought you were wrong. I was wrong not to say anything.  I was afraid to speak up.  It's hard to be a monk, you know? \nRipley stops.  Looks at him. A long beat. \nRIPLEY Thank you.  If anything, you're honest. \nJOHN We all are.  Took vows. \nRIPLEY I don't know about the Abbot. \nJOHN I'm sure he thinks what he did was right. \nRIPLEY Is that speaking up for someone? \nJOHN No.  Charity. \nShe smiles.  They turn a corner... \nINT. SLOPING CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nThis hallway slopes downwards a few degrees.  The three find themselves trotting, leaning backward to keep their balance. \nRIPLEY All right, let's forget about the past and get on to our survival.  No more prisoners behind us? \nANTHONY Not for years. \nRIPLEY Okay -- If the Alien's had a few days to lay his eggs our only hope is to get off this - What is this? \nJOHN Arceon. \nANTHONY Satellite. \nRIPLEY Get to my ship and get off this Satellite. \nJOHN We can't. \nRIPLEY We can't what? \nJOHN Leave Arceon.  Can't leave the library -- \nRIPLEY A Tape Library? \nJOHN Books. \nRIPLEY So? \nJOHN The reason we are out here.  Like the Monks who guarded Monastery Libraries on remote islands off England during the First Plague -- \nRIPLEY There must be books on other colonies -- \nJOHN Some of these books survived the burning of the Libraries of Alexandria.  They contain knowledge that exists in no other record.  Their value is unestimable. \nHe runs his hand along the spine of the book in his bag. \nJOHN We're supposed to protect them. \nRIPLEY (to Anthony) And what does an android have to do with all this? \nJOHN He's a spy. \nANTHONY The Company planted me here. \nRIPLEY The Company?  What does the Company have to do with this? \nANTHONY They built this prison. \nRIPLEY Prison? \nJOHN Colony. \nANTHONY Prison.  They are all political heretics. \nRipley looks at John. \nRIPLEY You left that part out. \nJOHN The order was more of a counter culture, a reaction to the Technology that was beginning to take over everyone's lives. It was a simple enough idea - Read, don't watch disk.  Walk, don't pump more carbons into the air.  The earliest members renounced technology.  Started to collect the remaining books.  Nobody would have noticed if it hadn't been for the Virus. \nRIPLEY Your Abbot talked about that.  The New Plague. \nRIPLEY Well, you start appreciating him more than me and I'll find a way to shut you down, capisce, Andy?  How do we get up? \nJOHN There are ladders. \nShe stops.  John and Anthony continue on a few steps and then stop and walk back to her. \nRIPLEY Five miles with the Alien between us and there?  Good luck, boys. \nShe turns and heads back towards her cell -- John catches her shoulder -- \nJOHN You can't -- \nRIPLEY Can't what?  Not help you go to your deaths?  I've had my fill of that. \nJOHN I need you.  I can't do it alone. \nRIPLEY I've fought these creatures twice before.  It take a lot to kill these things.  Heavy artillery. \nANTHONY We don't have weapons here. \nRIPLEY How about something we can make weapons from?  Do you have anything like that -- any modern things here? \nJohn SHAKES his head vehemently -- \nJOHN We renounced technology.  It was those things that caused the Plague. \nRIPLEY This is a man-made planet.  Something has to be recirculating your air, your water. \nJOHN God? \nRIPLEY Please. \nJOHN I don't know.  I just took it for granted. \nRIPLEY Most people do.  Without some sort of technology we haven't got a chance. \nFrom behind them: \nANTHONY There is technology. \nJohn and Ripley turn to look at him. \nANTHONY A room.  A Technology room.  Fresh air and water come out. \nRIPLEY An atmosphere processing plant -- \nANTHONY The heart and lungs of Arceon. \nRIPLEY Where is it? \nANTHONY One level beneath the underground sea. \nJOHN That's five levels up -- \nANTHONY (points into the gloom) On the other side of the orbiter. \nJohn looks at Ripley -- \nJOHN A chance. \nRipley looks from John's earnest face to the darkness and back. \nRIPLEY All right.  You've got me - so far. But here's the deal:  I don't know how many of your brethren are going to be alive when we get up there, but if we make it to my ship, you're all coming with me.  We'll take as many of your precious books as we can carry, but we're going.  I'm not going to fight this thing again to end up alone again.  Understand? \nJohn nods his head. \nRIPLEY We're all dead anyway.  We might as well go fi -- \nShe feels a TWINGE in her midsection -- Doubles over.  Anthony and John each take an arm -- \nRIPLEY Ugh - I'm all right. \nShe takes a deep breath. \nRIPLEY Still thawing out.  I hate hyper sleep... Come on. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ARCEON - MONASTERY LEVEL - NIGHT \nRIPLEY I got a belly full of that from the Psychtechs when I was on Earth.  Yeah. \"Survivor Guilt syndrome,\" or something like that.  But that's not what I was thinking about.  I was thinking about my \"friend\" up there. \nShe looks up. \nRIPLEY He was on the pod.  He killed Newt but not me.  Why not me?  It's almost like he's playing with me.  Maybe they have some sort of race memory.  Maybe he knows what I did to his \"mother.\" That's why he didn't just kill me. That would be too easy.  He has to torment me. \nJOHN You make it sound human. \nRIPLEY Hell, I don't know what it is. \nJohn unconsiously fingers his book. \nJOHN I think I do. \nINT. LADDER-WELL - PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT \nAt the end of the space a rough hewn wooden ladder leads to another block of cell corridors four stories up. Years of damp air have warped the ladder. Ripley leads the way, torch in her left hand. They climb... \nINT. END OF PRISON CORRIDOR - FOURTH LEVEL - NIGHT \nDark.  Ripley is the first one up. She raises her torch and heads down the new corridor alone. The cells here have no doors. She holds her torch in one -- An old skeleton sits in quiet contemplation. \nAT THE LADDER \nJohn is just climbing off, Anthony right behind him. Anthony is winded.  He reaches up for a helping hand. John looks back and sees that Ripley has moved ahead without them, then reaches down to help Anthony. Their hands clasp -- \nANTHONY HAS A \"VISION\" \nHe is seemingly standing in an open field, sheep grazing peacefully at his side. SUDDENLY he is ATTACKED by a horde of Medieval demons. \nFish faced demons.  Man-headed bird demons. They fly about him, grab hold of his limbs. The Sheep nearest him opens it's mouth to reveal a horde of razor sharp fangs, SINKS THEM INTO HIS ANKLE -- \nAnthony SCREAMS -! \nRIPLEY \nDown the corridor HEARS the scream, turns back -- sees Anthony fighting with himself, struggling against John's grasp - \nANTHONY \nBalanced precariously on the top of the ladder in the real world as he fights against the demons in his android mind -- He JERKS -- Pulls his left ankle out of the grasp of the DEMON SHEEP -- OFF the ladder - forty foot drop waiting below him... \nJOHN \nStruggles to keep his death grip on Anthony's hand. It's all that keeps Anthony from falling back down the shaft -- \nJOHN Jesus Christ.  Ripleeeee -! \nHe PULLS with all his might... \nANTHONY \nSEES a horrible BIRD-DEMON grasping his hand in its beak -- BITING through his wrist.  He waves his staff in the air -- He aims for its head: CRACK -! WHACKS John's hand with his staff -- \nJohn HOWLS in pain - LETS GO -- \nAnthony TEETERS BACK ON ONE FOOT, arms waving in the air -- \nRipley's hands SHOOT OUT -- GRAB Anthony's cassock -- STOP his fall. \nAnthony's eyes open wide at the sight of this new horror -- A terrible, wet, black cable-armed CREATURE that's latched itself onto his cassock -- Long, shiny head. Ripley has become the Alien. \nWHACK! Anthony HITS the Creature with his staff -- HITS Ripley on the head. WHACK! Again.  In the face. \nJohn tries to take hold of Anthony's staff arm -- WHACK! The cane WHIPS against the side of his head, knocking him back. Ripley sets her feet and pulls on Anthony's cassock -- Opens her mouth - GRUNTS -- \nANTHONY sees the terrible Alien open it's maw to devour him. \nWHACK! His staff connects with the bridge of Ripley's nose. She sees flashes of light -- loses her balance -- Pitches forward, starts to go over with Anthony -- \nJOHN GRABS THEM! \nWraps his arms around the struggling pair and like a sumo wrestler LIFTS and FALLS backwards - carrying the three of them into the corridor -- WHUMPH! \nThey land on the floor in a heap. Anthony continues to FLAIL ABOUT -- \nRipley and John pin him to the floor between them. Finally, the vision leaves him. He loses consciousness. \nJOHN \nANTHONY \nBringing up the rear, puts his walking stick down -- SNAPP!!! Everybody stops at the sound. \nABBOT What was that? \nAnthony pulls his stick from the grasp of a-- \nANTHONY Man trap. \nThey lower their candles.  Look to: \nTHE FLOOR \nInterspersed throughout the timbers -- Spring jawed, steel toothed, BEAR TRAPS. Rusted.  Open.  And all around them. \nANTHONY In case anyone tried to get in and tamper with the technology. \nThe four of them are standing in the middle of a mine-field of man traps.  Nobody moves. \nABBOT What do we do? \nRIPLEY Don't move.  Don't breath. \nABBOT We can't just stand here and wait. \nRIPLEY Floor's too unstable to try to walk around them. \nJohn pulls a loose board from the corridor wall. Turns and kneels at the trap in front of him. Pokes the end of the board into the jaws... SNAP!! \nThe others jump at the sound -- \nABBOT John - what are you doing? \nJohn pulls the stick out of the rusted jaws. Moves to the next trap -- Snap!! \nRIPLEY He's thinking like a leader.  Everyone: Grab wood.  Spring the traps.  Clear a path. (proud of him) Good work, Father John. \nJOHN Brother. \nRIPLEY Brother.  Let's go. \nRipley pulls a plank from the wall next to her. Exposes a bit of the surface underneath -- It's METAL. \nShe touches the cool, familiar material.  Smiles. Now she knows this is not a dream. She turns and SPRINGS the trap in front of her -- SNAP!! \nTHE FOUR \nSlowly make their way down the corridor, one hand holding a candle high, the other poking a piece of wood into the trap in front of them... SNAP-SNAP...SNAP. SNAP. walking carefully around the yet unfired traps.... \nTHE DOOR TO THE TECHNOLOGY ROOM \nA huge wooden door with no knob or handle.  Looks like it could almost be part of the wall.  John and Ripley are the first to it.  They put down their planks and begin to feel around the edges of the door for some purchase. The Abbot joins them. \nBACK IN THE CORRIDOR \nAnthony lags behind.  He senses a presence in the hallway. Hears a sound behind him. We see a GLIMPSE of something -- He turns towards the sound -- \nEmpty hallway. \nHe thinks.  Starts forward again -- with his ear cocked to the rear... SNAP! \nAT THE DOOR \nRipley, John and The Abbot knock on the door, walls. Ripley leans her head against the wall in frustration and exhaustion.  To get this far, and be locked out. She feels sick to her stomach. How long since she had food? She looks over at John. He is staring at her. He turns red at being caught.  Cute. \nJOHN I just - are you allright? \nRIPLEY Tied.  Without sleep, food -- I just feel my age. (smiles) Figuring hyperspace time, I'm almost a hundred. \nShe wipes her brow and goes back to knocking... \nJOHN Hello? \nThe wall beneath his fist sounds hollow. Fingernails find the edge of the plank and pull -- The plank slides aside on tiny, rusty pneumatic pistons. \nBEHIND THE PLANK \nA primitive KEYBOARD.  Circa late twentieth century. \nABBOT Maybe more than one of us. \nRIPLEY Let's talk about the facts, Mr. Abbot. \nShe looks at the windmills. WHOOSH...WHOOSH... \nRIPLEY This is your technology? \nABBOT Even this is forbidden to us. \nRIPLEY Well then, the facts are that we're screwed. \nShe moves into the room.  Walks around one of the Windmills. \nRIPLEY An Eco system.  Nothing to recycle your atmosphere except the green plants.  Winds generated down here -- (looks at the floor) Windmills use the natural surface winds to turn wheels underground, create tides on the seas to recirculate your water... \nANTHONY More than that.  There are pumps beneath the floor - I can feel their vibration. \nRIPLEY Probably pumping this air through charcoal filters. \nWHOOSH...WHOOSH... \nRIPLEY It gets colder all the time here, right? \nJohn looks at her questioningly. \nJOHN Yes... \nRIPLEY Your wood burning fires throw soot into the atmosphere, building the cloud layer - cutting off the sun's rays - cooling the planet, forcing you to burn more wood. \nWHOOSH...WHOOSH... \nANTHONY The Greenhouse Effect.  It's how the Earth almost destroyed itself in the late 20th century. \nRIPLEY Don't you see?  This is a planet set to self destruct.  Not in ten minutes or two hours but soon.  Your atmosphere here is finite.  If the plants die the fires will eat up all the oxygen - this planetoid will be dead - Everyone will die. \nThe Abbot has the look of a man who has been beaten in the last few meters of a Marathon. \nABBOT It's here.  I was just hoping I would be dead long before it came to this. \nJOHN What? \nABBOT We're supposed to die here.  That's the point. \nRIPLEY Wait a minute -- you were exiled --? \nABBOT The punishment for our crime was death. \nAnthony sits up. \nANTHONY This planet is the supreme triumph of planned obsolesence.  A certain amount of primitive materials with an atmosphere processing system as fragile as a real environment but not replenishable. \nThe Abbot has a faraway look in his eyes... \nABBOT Poetic justice for the anti-technologists. The Company's best work.  You know, I used to be a corporate executive.  Middle range V.P.  Then my wife got hit by a speed craft. I chucked it all and joined the order. Be a monk -- see the world.  Being here, being chairman of the board... \nRIPLEY No, now I understand why I landed here. To join you happy lunatics in your deaths. \nRipley moves away... John starts after her. \nJOHN Ripley, wait -- \nThe Abbot stands, blocks his way. \nABBOT Where can she go?  She's trapped. (beat) Trapped inside her own prison.  A prison in her mind.  Inside her mind.  Dancing. Sparklets of light - dance with the june bugs in the recesses of ourmindstheyare coming to danceintheshadowof... \nJohn and Ripley turn to look at the Abbot. He begins to speak faster.  Faster. He shakes.  Vibrates is more accurate -- A trickle of BLOOD runs from his left ear... \nABBOT RidingthewildwindsofchangeNoescapeNo escapeforthewickedEvilEvilthynameis woman.Woman.Womanheiscoming.Heiscoming foryouuuuuuuuu --* \nSPLORTCH-KT--!! The Abbot's HEAD EXPLODES --!!! Like a ripe melon dropped ten stories onto pavement. Blood, bone, hair and brain matter SPRAY John. John SCREAMS. \nA HORRIBLE ALIEN HEAD BURSTER \nIs all that sits atop the blood spurting neck of the Abbot. It keeps it's hold on the Abbot's spinal cord -- The Abbot's body continues to stagger around, arms jerking mechanically as lack of fresh nerve impulses from the brain works its way through the system. \nRipley SCREAMS. The Infant Alien-headed corpse stumbles towards her -- She plucks Anthony's staff from the floor and SWINGS -- -- Like a child hitting a baseball from a TEE -- WHACK-K -!! BLASTS the Chest/head burster across the room -- \nIt hits the floor SCRAMBLING.  Scuttles down into where the Windmills meet the floor.  Disappears. \nRIPLEY He could be waiting on the other side of that door.  We might not get ten feet before he kills the three of us. \nHe shakes his head. \nJOHN We had better go, then. \nHe smiles. She smiles back. They move up the ladder. \nIt leads up a damp, short shaft, walls GREEN with algae, to \nAN UNDERGROUND DOCK - NIGHT \nThe ladder shaft opens onto a barnacled pier.  Ripley and John climb out onto the wooden structure.  Before them: \nAN UNDERGROUND SEA stretches the width of the entire planet, over five miles across.  The floor of the lowest level of the top half of the orbiter makes a ceiling that looms a hundred feet overhead. \nThe water sparkles with a golden glow. \nJOHN Must be day on the surface of the planet. \nRIPLEY Where is the light coming from? JOHN Mirrors.  Reflect the outside light down great shafts -- through lenses.  That's what they make in the glass factory. Lenses.  Look -- \nShe turns: \nA HUGE WATERFALL \nLit from within by daylight beaming down from above -- pours into the sea a short distance from them. \nJOHN Opens to the surface.  Water flows in and out.  I don't know how.  There's one at either end.  I came down on the other side. \nRIPLEY What do we do? \nJohn points to three small leather and wood coracles bobbing at the end of their ropes. \nJOHN We cross. \nINT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - DAY \nAnthony has dragged himself to a sitting position against the bottom of one of the windmills.  He winces as he prods his tender ankle with the end of his staff.  It SPARKS. The large canvas arms of the windmill rotate above his head. The wind blows through his hair. WHOOSH...WHOOSH... Feels good. \nAnthony reaches up and waves his hand of his \"eyes.\" \nANTHONY Now the seer can only see what God wants him to.  Forty years on a planet of Monks and I've finally found religion. \nA floor board CREAKS. Anthony strains to hear: \nANTHONY John?  Ripley? \nWHOOSH...WHOOSH... He knows it is not. \nANTHONY Well come then.  I haven't got forever. \nA shadow falls across his face.  He can feel it. He doesn't have to see what is here. \nTHE UNDERGROUND OCEAN - DAY INTO NIGHT \nThe leather boat makes its way across the sea. John rows while Ripley holds the torch aloft. As night falls she takes the oars. \nThe Ocean is dead calm.  The coracle glides across the glass- like surface.  John flexes his scarred fingers. \nRIPLEY Your hands okay? \nJOHN They'll be fine.  You've been on a boat before. \nRipley squints ahead of them. The ocean seems to go on forever. \nRIPLEY I was a warrant officer on a ship -- but I did all my sailing in space. \nJOHN Father Anselm used to take me on his coracle when I was little. \nRipley leans forward - scans his face. \nRIPLEY How old were you when they towed this satellite out here? \nJOHN Five.  The Abbot said they put us to sleep for the thirty years it took to get here.  We've had almost forty more.  Until now. \nRIPLEY What happened to your mother? \nJOHN Never had one.  I mean, never knew her. I mean, I did, once.  She left my father when he joined the movement.  If she hadn't I wouldn't be here.  They kept the other children with the women, on Earth.  That was too long ago now.  Like a dream. \nClimb through a hole where a trap door has been torn off it's hinges.  They look at the grim tableau: \nMonks impaled on their own pikes. Tangled together in their own pungy stakes. Alien cocoon material cobwebbed over their bodies. \nTHE MONASTERY \nFlickering fires lit the first few floor windows. Ripley takes a step towards it -- Reaches back and pulls John... \nINT. GLASS FACTORY - NIGHT \nThe Glass furnace boils almost to the point of overflow. Small fires burn out of control around the room. Finished glass pieces BURST from the heat. Ripley and John enter. \nJOHN This is the glassworks.  They have tools here -- (spots) Kyle -- \nHe runs across the room -- \nBROTHER KYLE \nSits calmly at the Marver table. He places playing cards on the table in front of him. Solitaire. He sings to himself quietly. \nKYLE (sotto) Can't see my baby. Don't see my baby.  Bay be. \nJohn grabs him by the lapels - pulls him to his feet. The playing cards fall to the floor -- Kyle watches them, not John. \nJOHN Kyle.  Brother Kyle. \nKYLE Cards on the floor, fifty two pickup. Black king on red queen, put the ace up -- \nJohn SHAKES him. \nJOHN Kyle goddammit! \nRipley moves closer. \nRIPLEY John - it's too late -- \nKyle begins to sing faster.  Faster. \nKYLE Ace up.  Put the ace up.  Redaceupup. Blackaceup.Up.Pup-pup-pup-chaka- boomloommawhacka -- Booomalooma looma -- \nRipley and John look at each other. They know what this means. John pulls a length of rope off a nearby table. Moves in front of Kyle.  Looks into his glassy eyes. A tear runs down his cheek. \nJOHN Keep singing, my friend. \nJohn loops the rope around Kyle's neck. Strangles him. Eases the lifeless body to the floor. Stares at it. \nRIPLEY \nPulls a blowing iron from the rack.  Feels its weight and balance.  A reasonable weapon.  She crosses to John. \nJOHN I killed him.  I'm a doctor and I killed him. \nRIPLEY You had to.  You're supposed to end suffering. \nShe hands him a pontil, a pointed iron spear used to form the molten glass shapes. \nRIPLEY Let's get the hell out of here. \nINT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT \nRipley and John move up the stairs. Flickering orange lit from below. Smoke and soot rise from the first on the lower floors. \nINT. LIBRARY - NIGHT \nThey enter carefully.  The room is exactly as John left it, books out of shelves, hanging on their chains. \nRIPLEY He's made a mess. \nJohn pushes ahead of her. \nJOHN No.  He hasn't been up here yet.  I did this. \nHe moves to the nearest shelf and uses his pontil to pry open the lock -- \nJOHN Here - philosophy - we'll start here -- \nAAAROO --! A HAIRY BLUR flies out from between the stacks -- WHUMPH!  Knocks John to the floor -- Licks his face. \nJOHN Mattias! \nJOHN \nFinds himself HANGING over the bubbling glass vat - Caught - DANGLING on the Flying Fox rope.  Five feet away - the ledge the Flying Fox is launched from.  He looks down: \nHe can see the huge open vat of molten glass below him.  To its right, the Water DUMP TANK - a large wine cask-looking affair where finished pieces are cooled.  He looks up: \nRipley holding onto the edge of the broken floor above. \nJOHN Are you all right? \nRipley grunts an affirmative response. At least is she falls, it will only be a twenty-foot drop to the floor.  John is looking at instant par-boiling. John starts to move hand over hand UP the rope.  He begins to sweat. A drop of sweat falls... HSSS! POPS AND SIZZLES as it hits the surface of the molten glass -- \nRIPLEY \nTries to pull herself up to the floor above -- The next level is a raging fire. \nShe can only hang and DROP.  She DOES -! Falls the two stories. Bends her knees and ROLLS on impact. \nJOHN \nHas reached the ledge overlooking the furnace. He stands.  Sees Ripley slowly rising -- \nJOHN Ripley -! \nRipley shakily gets to her feet. Hops on one foot. \nRIPLEY Aargh.  I'm fine.  Let's get the fuck out of -- \nSUDDENLY \nTHE ALIEN'S head breaks the surface of the molten glass. SCREAMING.  STEAMING.  It is white-hot - translucent -- covered with -- It looks like MOLTEN GLASS!! \nHook-like hands grasp the edge of the tank -- It tries to climb out -- \nRipley turns to run.  Tender ankle gives out. She falls face down on the floor -- Rolls over -- \nTHE ALIEN is going to climb out of the vat -- She SCREAMS -- \nJOHN \nGrabs the Flying Fox handle. SWINGS down the rope - across the room -- PAST the Alien -- \nIt turns away from Ripley - She scrambles across the floor... \nJohn lands HARD. Points -- \nJOHN Ripley - the lever!! \nRipley looks next to her:  a burning wooden lever. \nThe Alien has one foot out of the glass furnace -- \nRIPLEY grabs the lever -- Hssssst! Putting out the fire with her hand -- Pulls -- \nTHE HUGE DUMP TANK OF WATER \nDUMPS.  Empties a thousand gallons -- RAINS DOWN on the Alien. It HOWLS in pain -- \nThe Molten Glass instantly COOLS -- The rapid extreme temperature change causes the beast to BE-THWOOOoooOOM -!! EXPLODE into a million pieces...!!!! \nRipley helps John off the floor. They are battered.  Bloody. They look into the vat. The steam clears... \nThe room is littered with Alien Bits. Each piece is encased in glass -- Trapped like a fly in amber. \nJOHN Saw that happen to a bottle once. \nRIPLEY (panting) Beat... Beat him - ugh -- \nShe grabs her stomach as her knees give out. John gives her an arm for support. \nJOHN We've got to get to the Library -- \nRIPLEY Don't worry.  Ship.  Just -- \nThey look up: \nMattias looks down through the hole in the floor. BARKS... \nINT. LIBRARY - NIGHT \nJOHN My book -- I know what to do -- \nRIPLEY What, an exorcism?  No good. \nJOHN You can't do this.  Ripley - listen to me - you're confusing feeling of guilt for actual sin - I can help you -- \nRIPLEY (ignoring) I've set a time lock.  When the pod escapes the Colony's gravitational pull this compartment will open.  Then all you have to do is get into the Stasis tube with Mattias and press the blue button.  With any luck a freighter or something will pick you up.  Good luck. \nHe pounds his fists against the door. \nJOHN NO!  No, Goddammit - you can't do this. You can't let it win. \nShe turns away from the door. \nRIPLEY It always wins.  We killed it, but it's still inside me -- You're my last chance. If I can keep you alive it'll make up for all those I've lost. \nJOHN Listen to me!  You have to let me try! Ripley:  You're MY only chance! \nShe's listening... \nJOHN I told you Father Anselm raised me. He raised me and when he was dying I couldn't do anything to save him.  I didn't know enough.  It was my fault he died.  If you don't let me try to save you my body will live but my soul will be dead. \nRipley turns and stares at him. \nJOHN Please. \nCUT TO: \nTHE PAGE \nA MEDIEVAL ETCHING. A Monk vomits up the devil. \nPull back as John lowers Ripley to the pod floor. John closes his eyes. Closes the book. \nHe pours some water into a small plastic cup. Retrieves a small pouch of herbs.  Opens it. Wrinkles his nose - they smell -- pours these ancient medicines into the space age cup. \nRIPLEY What is this stuff? \nJOHN (forceful) Something that will make you well. Something that will make you sick. \nRIPLEY I don't -- \nJOHN Shut up and drink. \nHe lifts the back of Ripley's head -- FORCES the drink down her throat. \nJohn swings his leg over her midsection.  STRADDLES her. Presses his two hands together in prayer. Then balls them into one fist. Takes a deep, preparatory breath... \nRipley starts to GAG -- Cough. Her body starts to JERK -- \nJohn BRINGS HIS FIST DOWN INTO HER STOMACH -- WHAMM -!! \nRipley CONVULSES -- has the dry heaves -- \nWHAM!  WHAM --! John PUMMELS Ripley's diaphragm! \nShe sputters -- VOMITS a thick mucous-like substance -- HEAVES -- \nRipley's back arches -- She SCREAMS a gut wrenching WAIL -- Her torso BULGES as the creature is forced upwards. \nJohn BEARS down -- Pushes UP under her ribs -- FORCING the chest-burster up her throat -- \nRipley fights for air as the alien STOPS halfway up her esophagus -- She's choking -- \nJohn crosses himself -- takes a deep breath -- Lowers his mouth to hers -- Inhales.  Exhales.  CPR. \nTHE ALIEN CHEST BURSTER \nSLITHERS out of Ripley's mouth -- \nINTO JOHN'S!! Reptilian tail whips about before disappearing down his gullet. \nJohn falls back against a computer console. Gagging.  Fights to speak. \nRipley raises herself up on one elbow. Alien mucous drooling down her chin. Hair matted against her forehead. \nRIPLEY Why? JOHN Choking.  It was the only way. \nHe drops the open book in front of her: She sees the etching. \n", "test1_input": "JOHN \nRows right into it. His coracle pitches in the choppy surf. He scrambles onto the ship's cracked tile surface. Teeters -- balances -- moves to the unmistakeable HATCH. Looks around for a knob, a handle -- \nNEXT TO THE HATCH \nA small panel door whose black and yellow stripes denote urgency.  John hesitantly opens the door, revealing a shiny metal LEVER.  He stares at it...a beat. Then quickly pulls it down... WUORRRSH -! Hull door OPENS. \nThe doorway is a black maw. John crosses himself. Begins to lower his foot into the hatch -- \nKYLE O/S Watch it! \nHe almost falls backwards off the ship.  Looks back -- \nTHE OTHER MONKS \nAre rapidly approaching. Kyle gestulates wildly -- \nKYLE John!  Wait -- !  Don't go in! \nJohn turns back to the open hatch. Machine recirculated air flows out. He feels it on the skin of his face.  Cool. Cool, and artificial.  It calls to him. He steps in.  Swallowed by the blackness -- \nWHOOSH-CLANG -! The door closes behind him. \nINT. SULACO ESCAPE POD #4 - DAY \nDark.  Dim red lights.  John stands still as his eyes adjust to the darkness.  He sees: \nNEWT'S HYPER SLEEP TUBE \nA glass and metal COFFIN -- pneumatic piping twines around its base.  The glass lid is BROKEN.  A Small RED LIGHT pulses at the head of the tube -- a soft VOICE and TONE, like your seat belt warning -- is audible... \nCOMPUTER VOICE (sotto) Seal broken...seal broken... \nJohn finds himself moving towards the tube... Looks through the broken lid: \nIN THE TUBE \nThere is a splattered BLOOD STAIN on the sterile white interior.  OLD, turned rust-brown. Whatever happened here happened a while ago. Rust colored drips trail down to -- \nTHE FLOOR \nDrag marks.  His eyes follow the stains to a pile of Bloody clothing against a control panel.  A jumpsuit.  Torn. Child size.  The head of child's DOLL, but no body to be found. \nJOHN \nLooks back towards the door. Part of him wants to get the hell out here -- but he fights back his fear.  He is a doctor - or trying to be - someone in here may need his help.  He presses forward -- Averts his gaze from the clothing, UP to the blinking and glowing instrument panels and their myraid -- \nLIGHTS \nPressure lights.  Data lights.  Warning lights. Thousands of lights.  Like the stars in the sky. \nIt's been decades since he's seen technology like this -- and never this close up.  He steps further into the ship, his fear now replaced by fascination, follows the lights.... \nON A PALE GREEN SCREEN \nLED numbers race -- 7,291.01.05...06...07 A legand identifies \"Elapsed since separation.\" He moves on... \nA VIDEO MONITOR \nThrough scanning bars of snow, an image: A WOMAN with a YOUNG GIRL standing in front of her. The Woman's arms are wrapped around the girl. Protective. Maternal. \nThe Woman speaks.  Her message repeats itself. A tape loop, although John has no idea what that is. \nWOMAN ...taking pod four.  The Crew of the SS Sulaco and all Marine commandoes are dead. Ship's sensors have interrupted the hyper sleep cycle.  An overlooked alien egg has hatched.  Bishop and Hicks have been killed. Xenomorphs have infested the cruiser.  Newt and I are taking pod four.  The Crew of... \nThe WARNING TONE of the Woman's message rekindles John's fear. He moves more hesitantly around the periphery of the ship, following the trail of blinking instruments -- Drawn to touch a button.  Click... \nSOMETHING TENTACLE-LIKE DROPS DOWN ON HIS SHOULDER! Just an oxygen mask. \nJohn feels his rapidly BEATING heart as he pushes aside the plastic, dangling object and continues around the shuttle. His hand brushes over a SENSOR which responds by lighting and -- \nHSSSSSSSSS -! A BLAST of freon shoots out of an overhead pipe -- John SHOUTS and back up into -- \nANOTHER HYPER SLEEP TUBE!!! \nNext to Newt's now empty tube. Humming gently.  Still operational. John approaches it cautiously. He can make out the occupant through the lid... \nA WOMAN \n", "test1_true": "John looks from Ripley to her image on the monitor, then back. Sinks to his knees, reverent.  Fascination has replaced fear again.  Moves his face closer to the lid. Closer to hers... \nDAYLIGHT spills in -- John's head WHIPS towards the source of the light -- \nTHE DOOR \nOpen.  Kyle and the other monks. \nKYLE John - what is it?  Is this a Supply ship? \nJOHN No.  No supplies.  Kyle, there's someone in here -- \nThe Second Monk looks at Kyle. \nSECOND MONK This is forbidden. \nKYLE John.  Just get the hell out of there -- \nJOHN I don't want to stay.  I have to get her out before this sinks.  You come in, give me a hand -- \nKYLE Her?  Look, this is not the supply ship, so this is technology forbidden to us. Get out of there now! \nJohn looks down at Ripely. A KEYPAD is mounted at the head of the tube. A red button:  \"EMERG-OPEN\" That's plain enough. \nJOHN All right -- \nHe presses it. The Tube opens with a loud BLAST of compressed air. The Monks at the door recoil at the sound. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SPACE SHIP - ON THE SEA - DAY \nRipley has been lowered into a large coracle.  John holds her in front of him.  Unconscious. Her head lolls as the boat rocks on the waves. The monks start to row back to short. \nFIRST MONK (reverent) A space ship... \nSECOND MONK (even more reverent) A woman... \nKYLE You shouldn't have gone in -- \nJOHN I'm supposed to be a doctor. \nHe pushes Ripley's hair away from her forehead. \nJOHN She could've been lost. \nFIRST MONK Been a long time since I saw either. \nSECOND MONK It isn't sinking.  Look at it.  What are we supposed to do with it? \nKYLE What was it like in there --? \nJOHN Lights.  So many lights -- \nTHIRD MONK Tow it in.  Bring it in. \nSECOND MONK It's evil. \nFIRST MONK It's just technology. \nSECOND MONK Evil technology.  Look at these fish -- \nTHIRD MONK The Abbot will know what we should do with it -- \nKYLE Just lights? \nJOHN Machines.  Buttons.  Metal. \nSECOND MONK See?  Just look at the fish. \nTHIRD MONK The Abbot will know. \nSECOND MONK They're boiled.  These fish are boiled. \nJOHN Thousands of lights.  Like the stars. Like Heaven on Earth. \nRipley stirs in John's arms.  Groans. Fights to come out of her fugue state... Looks around through half-lidded eyes -- She is surrounded by rowing, cassocked Monks. MONKS?  She closes her eyes. Tries to clear the imagine.  Opens: They're still there. She looks down at the bloodied hands around her waist -- realizes she's sitting on someone's lap. Looks back over her shoulder -- \nJOHN \n", "test1_id": 3075, "test2_input": "RIPLEY I've faced this evil twice before - I guess I've gotten sensitive to it -- (beat) You're really a Doctor? \nJohn pats his canvas bag. \nJOHN See my bag? \nRIPLEY What's that book? \nJOHN Just a book. \nRIPLEY I don't buy \"just a book\" from a guy who says we can't leave the planet without the library. JOHN It's just... a medical book I might need. \nRIPLEY You don't have any food in there, do you? \nJOHN Only if you can eat bandages. \nRipley rubs her midsection. \nRIPLEY In a few hours that's going to sound good.  Going in and out of suspended animation - Christ I probably haven't eaten in a year. \nANTHONY (without opening eyes) You should've eaten the bread. \nRIPLEY AND JOHN Rest! \nRipley lets her head loll back against the wall. Closes her eyes.  Time passes. Her brow knits. John sees this. \nJOHN You all right? \nRIPLEY Aces. \nJOHN You weren't hurt when I landed on you? Bruised a rib? \nHe reaches over and puts his hands beneath her cassock. Feels her midsection.  His hands are warm. \nRIPLEY Are you sure you're a doctor? \nHe withdraws his hands. \nJOHN Sort of.  My father passed on when we first came here.  The Abbey's Physician - Father Anselm - took me in.  He really raised me -- (pause) Taught me what he could before he passed away.  He was schooled on Earth. \nRIPLEY Well, I'm just hungry. \nJOHN You haven't eaten since I took you out of your tube. \nRIPLEY You did that... \nShe reaches out and takes hold of his hands.  Turns them over. \nRIPLEY You burned yourself on the escape pod. \nHer hands on his makes him feel...uncomfortable. \nRIPLEY Thank you, I guess. \nThey look into each other's eyes -- \nANTHONY O/S You should've eaten the bread. \nRipley, embarrassed, releases his hands. Looks at Anthony.  He's trying to stand. \nANTHONY Enough rest.  There's beasties afoot. \nThey start into... \nA NARROW CORRIDOR \nCeiling so low their torches must be held out in front of them. Ripley makes an effort not to move faster than the two monks. \nINT. LADDER SHAFT \nA great long ladder hanging in the middle of nowhere. Seems at least a mile long. The group climbs... \nA SERPENTINE CORRIDOR \nLiquid drips through the ceiling planks over head. Falls into RED puddles on the slanted floor. \nJohn kneels, dips his fingertips -- \nJOHN Blood. (sniffs) Mixed with sea water. \n", "test2_true": "RIPLEY Blood. \nJOHN Getting close... \nJohn HEARS somthing. Raises his hand -- \"stop\" The group stops.  Flatten themselves against the wall. \nJohn takes Anthony's staff. Moves forward with it held out in front of him... WHIRLS around a blind corner -- SHOVES something against the wall -- Thump! It struggles -- \nRipley and Anthony run up -- raise their tapers -- Revealing: \nRIPLEY The Abbot. \nCassock torn, dirty.  Hair, eyes wild. Anthony's staff across his throat. John pulls back. \nJOHN Father -- \nRIPLEY (sarcastic) What are you doing down here, father? You look like you've seen something that doesn't exist. \nThe Abbot runs his fingers through his hair.  Smoothes it down. \nABBOT I was their spiritual leader.  I was not prepared to lead them in battle. Not against that thing. \nJOHN No one could be. \nRIPLEY I thought you said the evil was inside me -- that sealing me up was the answer to all your problems? \nABBOT Destruction.  The destruction YOU brought to us! \nRIPLEY I only tried to warn you. \nABBOT What are you doing with this woman --? \nJOHN We are going to the Technology Room. Trying to find some way to fight -- \nABBOT You don't join the devil to fight the devil. \nANTHONY She's helping us -- \nABBOT Look who defends the deceiver -- the one who isn't even human.  John, can't you see what is happening?  On ancient Earth, during the Black Death - many believed that God had abandoned them, so they appealed to the Devil.  Flocked to him hoping to save their bodies - losing their souls in the bargain. \nRIPLEY Father, we're all on the run from the same monster so let's not resort to the fire and brimstone routine.  I've been enlightened about your \"movement.\" Pretty funny to be tried for heresy on a planet of heretics. \nJOHN Please. \nThe time for pretense is past. \nABBOT All right.  I was trying to keep you quiet. \nJOHN Sir --? \nABBOT I do what I have to do to keep the Brotherhood together.  We all gave up believing in Earth a long time ago.  How do you think they would feel if told their exiled was in vain?  That the holocaust they were trying to avoid never occured?  Those men up there have grown to live with it. \nRIPLEY And with you as their leader. \nThe Abbot smiles.  Ripley is sharp. \nABBOT You threatened the status quo. \nRIPLEY So you, protector of knowledge and truth, lied to them. \nABBOT Only about you.  The rest I still believe.  If Earth still orbits its sun there is no way it could have survived being reduced to Barbarism. \nRIPLEY You're as bad as the Company. \nJOHN Ripley -- \nRIPLEY That's why you ran.  After all your talk death stared you in the face and you were afraid. \nABBOT Not afraid of death. \nRIPLEY The Alien. \nANTHONY The Organism. \nABBOT The Devil. \nINT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM CORRIDOR \nThe now four refugees work their way into the final corridor. Dark.  Turns at sharp angles.  Blind alleys. The floor is uneven, wood aged and twisted. Warped by years of water dripping from above. The group strings out as it moves into the darkness, candles held high... \n", "test2_id": 3076, "test3_input": "WHACKS the Alien with Anthony's staff -- Again.  Again.  The creature will not let Anthony go. The Android writhes in its grasp, his face now a blistered, pulpy mass, eyes gone. \nRIPLEY \nFinishes hot wiring.  The keyboard hums to life. Her fingers FLY across the keys -- \nTHE ALIEN \nTail wraps around John's waist -- Pulls him towards it -- LIFTS him - turns him upside down -- \nLips PULL BACK -- \nJohn's hands GROPE at the floor -- \nSharp metal teeth SPREAD -- \nTHE DOOR KEYBOARD \nLights:  CODE ACCEPTED Ripley's head whips towards the corridor -- \nJOHN \nHis hand closes around the end of one of the traps -- He brings it up -- SNAP!! It SLAMS closed on the Alien's extended Tongue -! The Beast bellows!! Whips its head from side to side -- Can't shake off the trap -- ACID BLOOD sprays out --! Lands as pools of FIRE on the wooden floor. \nTHE DOOR \nOpens with a strained blast of dust -- SEE-WHORCSSH! The Abbot LEAPS inside -- \nRIPLEY It's open!! \nJOHN \nPRIES Anthony's ankle out of his trap. Scoops up his staff, drags the moaning Android -- Back up the corridor -- \nRIPLEY \nStands in open Technology Room doorway -- \nABBOT Close it -- close it -- it's coming - \nRIPLEY We wait.  John!! \nJohn and Anthony appear out of the shadows -- Run/hobble towards the door -- \nTHE ALIEN \nAcid Blood DISSOLVES the traps' steel jaws.  PULLS itself free. Head whips towards the escaping Monks -- if it had eyes they would narrow to slits in anger -- RUNS up the hall -- \nRIPLEY \nFollows John and Anthony into the Technology Room. On the other side of the doorway: another keyboard. She punches keys -- \nABBOT Hurry -- \nJOHN HURRY!! \nTHE ALIEN \nYards away -- Limping.  Hissing. ANGRY. \nTHE KEYBOARD \nAcceptance tone \"bings.\" The Door starts to slide down -- \nThe Alien is feet away -- INCHES... \nThe door seats itself closed with a solid THUD. \nRipley, panting, rests eyes closed against the rough wooden door.  A beat. She turns to the room for the first time and finds -- \nWINDMILLS \nReal Man of LaMancha wood and cloth windmills.  Two story high arms slowly rotating.  Moving enormous volumes of air through the wind tunnel-like room.  As far as the eye can see. Turning, creaking. WHOOSH...WHOOSH... But no electronics.  No radio.  No weapons. This is the Technology Room. \nRipley collapses to the floor and loses consciousness. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.

It's owner cautiously follows... \nRIPLEY \nShe's breathing heavy. She's wearing a sweat soaked tank top. Her eyes flit from side to side.  Then up.  Then down. She pokes the weapon out ahead of her and moves into the pod. She silently crosses the distance to Newt's sleep tube: \nIN THE TUBE \nNewt sleeps peacefully. Ripley allows herself one maternal smile, then remembers. Her grip TIGHTENS in the Flame Thrower in her hands. She flips a switch to HI HEAT. Moves around the sleep tubes... \nA noise to her left. She WHIRLS -- \nPulls the trigger on the flame thrower -- click.  Nothing. She tries again -- a half-hearted burp, but no flame. She begins to panic -- \nSenses the Alien's presence. Looks left, right, up - no Alien... Looks down: \nThe Alien's tail is COMING UP BETWEEN HER LEGS. She turns -- \nRight into it's grasp. The useless flamethrower SKITTERS across the floor. She PUMMELS the beast with balled up fists. \nRIPLEY No.  NO!  I beat you!  I beat you mother fucker!! \nThe Alien spins her -- pushes her over across the sleep tube -- Like it's taking her from behind! \nRipley looks down into the sleep tube: \nNewt is gone. Her doll's head lays in a pool of blood. The Alien wraps his arms around Ripley. Thin lips pull back for a kiss. \nShe SCREAMS. \nINT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - REALITY - DAY \nRipley opens her eyes. WHOOSH...WHOOSH... She's still in the room with the windmills. Somehow this place seems less real than her dream. She looks around: \nJohn is sitting next to her, writing on a piece of parchment. He smiles a relieved smile. \nJOHN I thought we'd lost you. \nRIPLEY What are you writing? \nJOHN Last will and testament. (beat) Just kidding. \nShe looks to her left: Anthony is lying on his back, cotton bandage wrapped around his eyes.  His ankle is a swollen mess.  Wires are hanging out. \nRIPLEY Is he --? \nJOHN Resting. (shakes his head) He'll be fine. \nANTHONY No I won't.  He's a terrible liar. \nRIPLEY I'm sorry. \nANTHONY It's ironic.  I guess my visions were prescience after all.  How will I ever resolve that with my artifical con- science? \nA creaking floorboard to Ripley's right draws her attention to The Abbot.  He's pacing. \nABBOT Do you see what you've delivered us into? \nRIPLEY Yeah.  Lead me not into temptation to kick your -- ahh -- \nRipley tries to stand - her head spins. WHOOSH...WHOOSH... \nRIPLEY Oh shit. \nThe entire room THROBS with the rhythm of the wind. \nRIPLEY Where is the Big Boy -? \nThe Abbot points to the door. \nABBOT On the other side of that door. Waiting for us to starve to death. \nRipley moves to the door and feels it's cold surface. \nRIPLEY It's playing with us.  It could get in here any time it wants. \nABBOT Why should he enter?  He knows that one of the people in this room is in league with him. \nJOHN Sir.  We're all in the same coracle, so to speak. \n", "test3_id": 3077}

{"test1_input": "JOHN Brother Philip. \nPHILIP Feeding the mind instead of the body again? \nJOHN My training has taught me to feed what's hungry. \nPhilip pats his broad stomach and heads down the hallway. \nPHILIP As did mine.  As long as you're alone. Enjoy yourself -- and remember, no book leaves the library. \nJOHN How could I forget?  Have a good meal... \nJohn watches the corpulent librarian head down the stairs. When he's gone from sight John lifts the bottom of his cassock to reveal Mattias. \nJOHN Perfect. \nThey move into the library... \nTHE MEDIEVAL SECTION \nThe oldest books. John moves to the stacks. Mattias trots over to a particular bench and sits. This is his regular place. \nAT THE SHELVES \nJohn stands on toe tips to retrieve an ancient Tome. He runs his fingers over the familiar leather binding. A smile plays across his lips. \nHe carries the book, places it on the edge of the table so there is slack in the chain. Sits on the bench next to the dog. Clears his throat, opens the book, begins to read... \nJohn (reading) In the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks -- \nVOICE O/S Sometimes, I think you'd like that. \nJohn turns to find -- \nTHE ABBOT \nLeader of the monastery.  In his seventies but looks younger. His Cassock is adorned with a large, ornately carved, wooden CHAIN in place of a rope belt.  He crosses to the table. \nJohn closes the book and stands, head bowed in respect. \nJohn Abbot, I -- I didn't think anyone would -- \nABBOT Mind?  Just Philip, if he knew.  I passed him on the way up.  He said you'd come in alone.  I knew better. \nHe scratches the back of Mattias' neck. \nABBOT Hello, Mattias.  How are you, boy? \nThe dog snuffles in response. \nABBOT You know what Philip says about Mattias' hair and his breathing.  You'll have to take him out of here. \nJOHN He likes when I read to him and -- I can't -- \nJohn looks down sheepishly.  Though nearly forty, he feels almost adolescent in the presence of the Abbot. The Abbot pulls a large key from his pocket. \nABBOT (smiles) Someone must have left this one unlocked. Take the book with you. \nHe hands the key to John, who is shocked -- this is a great honor. \nJOHN Father, I --? \nABBOT Kyle tells me you did a good job at the glassworks today. \nJOHN I'll reserve judgement until the patient lives. \nJohn crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book. He returns the key. \nABBOT It will get easier.  Father Anselm was... an unexpected loss.  You'll do fine. \nThe Abbot walks towards the door... \nABBOT Just have it back before the end of lunch. Oh -- And I didn't see you in here. \nJOHN Thank you. (to Mattias) Let's go upstairs, boy. \nJohn takes his book -- Moves to a spiral wooden staircase. Mattias at his heels. Goes UP -- \nINTO THE BELL TOWER \n", "test1_true": "THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY \nThick with sandy dust.  The wood shows through thin patches. We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what we think is the roof of the Abbey is actually -- \nTHE SURFACE OF ARCEON - NIGHT \nThe door has opened onto the SURFACE OF A PLANTOID! The curving horizon broken only by the very top of the Abbey bell tower poking through from the levels below. SMOKE curls from vents set into the surface. Sunken areas of the planet's sirface are SEAS. \nThis is ARCEON. An manmade orbiter. A shell of lightweight foamed steel, five miles in diameter. Constructed by The Company on Special Order with habitable level within finished in whatever material suits its end user. \nThis orbiter, for reasons to be discovered later, has been sheathed in wood. \nJOHN \nWalks to the shore of an inland SEA. Sits on a bare patch of wood.  Looks up. His eyes grow accustomed to -- \nTHE NIGHT SKY - JOHN POV \nFreckled with tiny dots of light. Stars.  Spread across the inky void. Bathe Arceon's surface with their celestial glow. \nJohn smiles at Mattias, breathes deep. The atmosphere up here is thinner, but fresher. He opens the book. Reads aloud -- \nJOHN In the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks, day by day, one by one, until I am the only one left.  I stayed as long as I could bear it, then with my dog -- \nMattias lifts his ears at this part.  His favorite part. \nJOHN - fled.  I have put this to parchment lest this pestilence - this Black Death - stay my hand. (beat) This was finished by another hand... \nJohn closes the book.  Something catches his eye -- Something among the myriad points of light in the sky. Millions of miles away: \nONE OF THE STARS \nBrighter than the rest.  MOVING. Fast enough to leave a faint trail. Across the stars.  And down... A comet. \nJohn stands.  Watches -- \nTHE STAR \nGrowing brighter. Drawing nearer. \nJOHN \nJoined by three other MONKS. They are older than he. The Four men watch the sky... \nTHE STAR \nBrighter still.  Closer. \nMORE MONKS \nTwo dozen.  A hundred. They come up through the planet's surface. Out of wooden trap doors.  Join the others. Days pass. Now three hundred. Necks bowed back. Mouths agape. A SUBTITLE identifies... \nRELIGIOUS COLONY ARCEON POPULATION: 350 Exiles CRIME:  Political Heresy \nTHE STAR \nFills the sky. Burns brighter still as it hits the planetoid's atmosphere. \nON THE SURFACE OF ARCEON \nHundreds of Monks shield their eyes as the ship -- the star -- ROARS over their heads.  Trailing FIRE -- \nJohn holds up his hands - to touch a star -- Skin BLISTERS as it passes over him, He turns and watches as it -- Arcs downward -- \nINTO THE SEA \nWHOMP- SSSSSSSSSS --!! PLUMES of steam rise into the air. The water boils.  Fish bob to the surface.  Bloated.  Dead. \nJOHN \nIs the first to hit the shore. Small leather and wood fishing boats tossed by the wake. His coracle is the first into the water. The others running up behind him. He cannot hear the SHOUTS of warning. \nON THE SEA - DAWN \nThe sun cracks over the black water. John's hands move the rough wooden oars. Blistered palm opens. BLOOD flows. He tears off a piece of his cassock -- Rips it with his teeth -- Wraps the bloody hand. Rows. \nTHE STAR \nShip.  Star Ship. Sulaco escape vehicle #4 rocks on the water. White metal skin blackened by the heat. \n", "test1_id": 3075, "test2_input": "JOHN Yes.  I mean no.  I mean, that was part of it.  Look.  I never thought you were wrong. I was wrong not to say anything.  I was afraid to speak up.  It's hard to be a monk, you know? \nRipley stops.  Looks at him. A long beat. \nRIPLEY Thank you.  If anything, you're honest. \nJOHN We all are.  Took vows. \nRIPLEY I don't know about the Abbot. \nJOHN I'm sure he thinks what he did was right. \nRIPLEY Is that speaking up for someone? \nJOHN No.  Charity. \nShe smiles.  They turn a corner... \nINT. SLOPING CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nThis hallway slopes downwards a few degrees.  The three find themselves trotting, leaning backward to keep their balance. \nRIPLEY All right, let's forget about the past and get on to our survival.  No more prisoners behind us? \nANTHONY Not for years. \nRIPLEY Okay -- If the Alien's had a few days to lay his eggs our only hope is to get off this - What is this? \nJOHN Arceon. \nANTHONY Satellite. \nRIPLEY Get to my ship and get off this Satellite. \nJOHN We can't. \nRIPLEY We can't what? \nJOHN Leave Arceon.  Can't leave the library -- \nRIPLEY A Tape Library? \nJOHN Books. \nRIPLEY So? \nJOHN The reason we are out here.  Like the Monks who guarded Monastery Libraries on remote islands off England during the First Plague -- \nRIPLEY There must be books on other colonies -- \nJOHN Some of these books survived the burning of the Libraries of Alexandria.  They contain knowledge that exists in no other record.  Their value is unestimable. \nHe runs his hand along the spine of the book in his bag. \nJOHN We're supposed to protect them. \nRIPLEY (to Anthony) And what does an android have to do with all this? \nJOHN He's a spy. \nANTHONY The Company planted me here. \nRIPLEY The Company?  What does the Company have to do with this? \nANTHONY They built this prison. \nRIPLEY Prison? \nJOHN Colony. \nANTHONY Prison.  They are all political heretics. \nRipley looks at John. \nRIPLEY You left that part out. \nJOHN The order was more of a counter culture, a reaction to the Technology that was beginning to take over everyone's lives. It was a simple enough idea - Read, don't watch disk.  Walk, don't pump more carbons into the air.  The earliest members renounced technology.  Started to collect the remaining books.  Nobody would have noticed if it hadn't been for the Virus. \nRIPLEY Your Abbot talked about that.  The New Plague. \n", "test2_true": "JOHN After a scare like that, thousands flocked to our retreat.  People started clamoring for written information.  For our books. They abandoned the modern ways -- \nRIPLEY I think I can see how this comes out. They gave up their possessions. \nANTHONY This was a threat -- \nRIPLEY To the Company. \nJOHN They sold the technology.  A movement to live simply was quickly twisted by Federal agents into a political movement against the Company-controlled World Government.  Too much was at stake. \nRIPLEY Too much profit. \nJOHN We were sentenced as political dissidents. This orbiter is our gulag.  All the men were packed up with all our books, and towed into space.  Ten thousand men.  The eldest died very quickly. \nRIPLEY The Company had such a sense of irony. Sending you out on this wooden tub. \nANTHONY I was placed among them as a sensor. Keeps tabs on the movement. \nRIPLEY So how'd they find out about you? \nANTHONY I told them.  After the supply ship's stopped coming I saw no point in keeping up the charade.  Since I was a sort of walking reminder of technology, they cast me down. \nRIPLEY Join the club. (to John) I figured this wasn't planned.  You don't have to be a genius to see it wouldn't be prudent to try to preserve man's written works for generations -- without women. \nJohn looks embarrassed. \nRIPLEY And I don't know about your New Plague, but I was just on Earth and everything's fine. \nJohn has a doubtful look. \nRIPLEY I was right about the Alien, wasn't I? Means I must be right about the Earth. \nThe logic behind her argument is uncomfortable. \nJOHN (beat) Perhaps. \nRIPLEY That's better than nothing.  Come on. \nThey reach the end of the corridor. It opens into -- \nINT. TRANSOM SPACE - PRISON LEVEL \nAn enormous open space between \"cell blocks.\" The Wall behind them is honey-combed with corridor openings going up four stories, connected by aged, warped wooden ladders reminiscent of Indian cave dwellings.  Only wooden. \nThe room stretches several football field lengths ahead of them -- falling off into gloom. \nThey stand silent for a moment, dwarfed by the size of the room and the task ahead of them.  Finally -- \nRIPLEY At any rate, let's forget about the Earth completely - whether you're right or I'm right what's important is getting the hell out of here.  From here my ship is...? \nJohn points up at the ceiling. \nANTHONY In Heaven. \nRIPLEY Right.  And this is... \nAnthony and John nod. \nANTHONY This orbiter was patterned after a medieval concept of the universe -- (makes a circle in the air) They call the top half \"Heaven - \" \nJOHN The Abbey, the fields -- \nANTHONY The bottom half is \"Hell.\"  Where we are. \nRIPLEY Aptly named.  What's in the middle? \nJOHN The sea. \nANTHONY Really. \nRIPLEY Work with me here.  How far is it back to the surface of the planet? \nJOHN As a stone falls --- Five miles through the center. \nRIPLEY And the elevator -- the thing they lowered me down in? \nJOHN Ropes cut. \nANTHONY It's smart.  First he cuts their escape off, then works his way down through the monastery level by level until there isn't a thing left alive.  Interesting... \n", "test2_id": 3076, "test3_input": "WHACKS the Alien with Anthony's staff -- Again.  Again.  The creature will not let Anthony go. The Android writhes in its grasp, his face now a blistered, pulpy mass, eyes gone. \nRIPLEY \nFinishes hot wiring.  The keyboard hums to life.

Lands as pools of FIRE on the wooden floor. \nTHE DOOR \nOpens with a strained blast of dust -- SEE-WHORCSSH! The Abbot LEAPS inside -- \nRIPLEY It's open!! \nJOHN \nPRIES Anthony's ankle out of his trap. Scoops up his staff, drags the moaning Android -- Back up the corridor -- \nRIPLEY \nStands in open Technology Room doorway -- \nABBOT Close it -- close it -- it's coming - \nRIPLEY We wait.  John!! \nJohn and Anthony appear out of the shadows -- Run/hobble towards the door -- \nTHE ALIEN \nAcid Blood DISSOLVES the traps' steel jaws.  PULLS itself free. Head whips towards the escaping Monks -- if it had eyes they would narrow to slits in anger -- RUNS up the hall -- \nRIPLEY \nFollows John and Anthony into the Technology Room. On the other side of the doorway: another keyboard. She punches keys -- \nABBOT Hurry -- \nJOHN HURRY!! \nTHE ALIEN \nYards away -- Limping.  Hissing. ANGRY. \nTHE KEYBOARD \nAcceptance tone \"bings.\" The Door starts to slide down -- \nThe Alien is feet away -- INCHES... \nThe door seats itself closed with a solid THUD. \nRipley, panting, rests eyes closed against the rough wooden door.  A beat. She turns to the room for the first time and finds -- \nWINDMILLS \nReal Man of LaMancha wood and cloth windmills.  Two story high arms slowly rotating.  Moving enormous volumes of air through the wind tunnel-like room.  As far as the eye can see. Turning, creaking. WHOOSH...WHOOSH... But no electronics.  No radio.  No weapons. This is the Technology Room. \nRipley collapses to the floor and loses consciousness. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.

It's owner cautiously follows... \nRIPLEY \nShe's breathing heavy. She's wearing a sweat soaked tank top. Her eyes flit from side to side.  Then up.  Then down. She pokes the weapon out ahead of her and moves into the pod. She silently crosses the distance to Newt's sleep tube: \nIN THE TUBE \nNewt sleeps peacefully. Ripley allows herself one maternal smile, then remembers. Her grip TIGHTENS in the Flame Thrower in her hands. She flips a switch to HI HEAT. Moves around the sleep tubes... \nA noise to her left. She WHIRLS -- \nPulls the trigger on the flame thrower -- click.  Nothing. She tries again -- a half-hearted burp, but no flame. She begins to panic -- \nSenses the Alien's presence. Looks left, right, up - no Alien... Looks down: \nThe Alien's tail is COMING UP BETWEEN HER LEGS. She turns -- \nRight into it's grasp. The useless flamethrower SKITTERS across the floor. She PUMMELS the beast with balled up fists. \nRIPLEY No.  NO!  I beat you!  I beat you mother fucker!! \nThe Alien spins her -- pushes her over across the sleep tube -- Like it's taking her from behind! \nRipley looks down into the sleep tube: \nNewt is gone. Her doll's head lays in a pool of blood. The Alien wraps his arms around Ripley. Thin lips pull back for a kiss. \nShe SCREAMS. \nINT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - REALITY - DAY \nRipley opens her eyes. WHOOSH...WHOOSH... She's still in the room with the windmills. Somehow this place seems less real than her dream. She looks around: \nJohn is sitting next to her, writing on a piece of parchment. He smiles a relieved smile. \nJOHN I thought we'd lost you. \nRIPLEY What are you writing? \nJOHN Last will and testament. (beat) Just kidding. \nShe looks to her left: Anthony is lying on his back, cotton bandage wrapped around his eyes.  His ankle is a swollen mess.  Wires are hanging out. \nRIPLEY Is he --? \nJOHN Resting. (shakes his head) He'll be fine. \nANTHONY No I won't.  He's a terrible liar. \nRIPLEY I'm sorry. \nANTHONY It's ironic.  I guess my visions were prescience after all.  How will I ever resolve that with my artifical con- science? \nA creaking floorboard to Ripley's right draws her attention to The Abbot.

WHOOSH...WHOOSH... \nRIPLEY Oh shit. \nThe entire room THROBS with the rhythm of the wind. \nRIPLEY Where is the Big Boy -? \nThe Abbot points to the door. \nABBOT On the other side of that door. Waiting for us to starve to death. \nRipley moves to the door and feels it's cold surface. \nRIPLEY It's playing with us.  It could get in here any time it wants. \nABBOT Why should he enter?

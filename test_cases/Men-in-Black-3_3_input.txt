JAY There's gotta be something that connects you to Yaz. What cases are you working on? 
KAY Well, I'got this whole dry ice thing. 
JAY Dry ice? What's that? Someone get killed over some dry ice? Smuggling something in some dry ice? 
KAY No. We just can't figure out what it is. 
JAY Wow, you're pretty low on the totem pole, aren't you? The great Kay, looking for dry ice. 
KAY Don't push your luck. The doors open, and we're in... 
A WAY-OUT 60'S PARTY Kay's on the hunt for someone. They weave their way through the far-out types, hear snippets of high-60s party conversations. Someone notices Jay's suit -- 
PARTY SNOB What are you, a time traveller? 
JAY REACTS-- 
PARTY SNOB (CONT'D) That suit is SO five years ago. Kay sees who he's looking for, grabs him: 
KAY We need to talk. Reveal ANDY WARHOL -- and this is the Factory, and this is one of Warhols' famous parties. Draped on Warhol -- a bunch of strange hangers-on, his "stars." 
ULTRAVIOLET Yum, pigs are getting cute. Jay smiles -- she looks skeeved out. 
ULTRAVIOLET (CONT'D) I meant the young one. Warhol speaks with his strange -- yes, almost alien -- affect. 
WARHOL It's not really a good time to talk. I'm creating a party. (sighs, totally put out) But... Maybe if he asks me. 
JAY What - me? 
WARHOL I would never say no to anything that came out of that beautiful mouth... Jay is visibly uncomfortable. Kay nudges Jay - do it. 
JAY [Grumbles about what he has to do for his partner]. (then, to Warhol) We need to talk. Please. Warhol and his Stars ooh and ahh over Jay. Someone snaps a picture. 
WARHOL Amazing, just amazing. Alright, you talked me into it. Follow me. 
(MORE) 
WARHOL (CONT'D) 
(TO ENTOURAGE) Be back soon, stars. 
PRIVATE STUDIO LOFT From here, a window looks out over the whole scene. Warhol leads the guys in, shuts the door and LOCKS IT. Immediately, his ENTIRE AFFECT CHANGES -- he rips off his WIG, lights a cigarette, and talks like a hard-nosed cop. 
WARHOL Damnit, Kay, are you TRYING to blow my cover? 
KAY Take it easy agent W, your cover is perfectly safe. 
WARHOL Perfectly safe? Are you out of your goddamned mind? It's only a matter of time before they figure out I'm a total fraud. 
KAY Cool your jets-- 
WARHOL I'm so out of ideas I'm painting bananas and soup cans for chrissakes. How long do you really think they're gonna keep buying this shit? Warhol slumps on a chair.

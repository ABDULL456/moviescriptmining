MARIACHI Sure. 
The phone rings. Domino gets up to answer it. Mariachi reaches under his blanket for a small mirror and combs his hair, putting spit in his hair to slick it down. He quickly stashes the mirror. 
DOMINO (into phone) Hello? 
MOCO (into phone) Come see me. 
DOMINO (into phone) I can't. 
MOCO (into phone) Please. 
Moco is sitting at a table playing cards. 
DOMINO (into phone) I don't feel well. I've got to go. 
MOCO (into phone) Have you ridden the bike? 
DOMINO (into phone) No... I've got to go... 
She hangs up. 
MARIACHI Boyfriend. 
DOMINO (quiet as if thinking) No... 
MARIACHI I can't figure out something. You tell me you're poor. Poor family. Yet you've got this place. 
DOMINO (sighing) This place is a gift. 
MARIACHI From who? 
DOMINO From Mauricio. 
MARIACHI From EL MOCO? The man trying to kill me? 
DOMINO He's not trying to kill you, his man had you confused with Azul.

{"train": "I AM NUMBER 4 \nWritten by \nAlfred Gough & Miles Millar \nThe events in this film are real. Names and places have been changed to protect the Lorien Six, who remain in hiding. \nTake this as your first warning. Other civilizations do exist. Some of them seek to destroy you. \nFADE IN: \nA BILLION STARS pinprick the velvet-black sky that stretches over a vast sleeping jungle. A fingernail moon silvers the whispering canopy while gentle tendrils of steam rise. \nTITLE ON SCREEN: REPUBLIC OF CONGO, AFRICA. \nEXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT \nCAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS the eternity of treetops until it FINDS \nA BUNGALOW. It's 20x20 square, with a wraparound porch and simple wooden shutters. The structure is hidden in a clearing that's been crudely hacked out of the sweaty wilderness. \nINT. HUT - NIGHT \nTwo beds draped in mosquito nets sit on opposite sides of the space. A TEEN BOY sleeps in one and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN lies in the other. Their ebony skin glistens in the swampy heat. The numbing THROB OF INSECTS fills the silence until \nTHE DOOR SOFTLY RATTLES. The Teen's eyes fly open. Fear grips his face as he looks over at the Man, who is now upright and awake. They hold their breath, listening over the DRUMMING CHORUS. \nANOTHER RATTLE. It's louder this time. Unmistakable. The Teen watches as the Man pulls a crystal-handled dagger from under his pillow and stealthily creeps to the door. The Man cautiously leans in and peers through the bamboo slats. WHAT HE SEES: The empty porch. No sign of life. Relieved, he turns back, opens his mouth to speak when his face contorts. He looks down and sees the tip of \nA SERRATED METAL BLADE protruding from his chest. As the sword is viciously protracted through the door, the Man meets the Teen's haunted eyes and whispers his last, desperate word... \nMIDDLE-AGED MAN Run! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT \nThe Teen's naked feet pound the hot, wet earth as he sprints through the maze of trees. Flecks of moonlight ricochet off the crystal pendant that dangles around his neck. He moves impossibly fast. Faster than any human could. \nA MONSTROUS HOWL ECHOES as something otherworldly catches his scent and begins thrashing in pursuit. The Teen's face tightens with dread and the SHOUTS of his pursuers hammer his ears. He doesn't look back, willing himself to survive. He races up a verge and fearlessly launches himself off the edge of \nA 100-FOOT-WIDE RAVINE! GOD SHOT LOOKING DOWN as the Teen leaps across the abyss. He kicks air as he arcs and finally touches down on the opposite lip. Chest heaving, he sees the hideous silhouette of \nA HULKING BEAST. It's called a Piken and skitters to a stop on the other side. It utters a chilling BANSHEE WAIL of frustration. Relieved, the Teen turns to make his escape when \nA HAND wraps around his throat. He is effortlessly hoisted by a TOWERING MAN with skin as cold and pale as alabaster. \nTHIS IS A MOGADORIAN. He wears the long red coat of a Commander. We catch the briefest glimpse of his cruel magenta eyes as they scan the geometric symbol engraved on the Teen's pendant. Silhouetted against the giant jungle moon, he triumphantly raises \nA SWORD. Its serrated blade ignites with silver flame as it sweeps towards the Teen. The boy's DEATH CRY echoes as the CAMERA ZEROES IN ON the pendant that glows brilliant-bright. \nFORM CUT TO: \nTHE SAME SYMBOL. It glimmers to life on the ankle of another TEEN 10,000 miles away. His name's DANIEL and he's in the middle of a wild jet- ski race with TWO BUDDIES. \nTITLE ON SCREEN: BIG PINE KEY, FLORIDA, USA. \nThe trio crisscrosses the turquoise sea while a party rages on the beach. Daniel makes a kamikaze move, whips his jet ski past his opponents and victoriously pumps his fist. But his moment of triumph is cut short. His face contorts in agony as he feels \nTHE SYMBOL searing into his skin. As he leans forward to grip his ankle, he cartwheels off the jet ski and viciously body-slams across the water. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - DAY \nLOOKING UP as Daniel crashes into view. Needles of light flicker from the symbol. It's cauterizing into his flesh like a brand. \nINT. BATHROOM - MOTEL - NIGHT \nDaniel sits on the edge of a bathtub. He gently unwraps the bandage that covers his ankle and fearfully inspects the neat scab that has formed over the wound. \nDANIEL (V.O.) I got the first scar when I was eight. I woke up screaming. We lived in Vermont. The second was on a Tilt-a-Whirl at a fair in Michigan. I was 12. Yesterday was the third. His finger traces the lines of the other two scars. \nEXT. INTERSTATE - DAY \nThe lush tropical landscape has browned into flat, dormant farmland. The silver SUV charges through the bleak monotony. \nDANIEL (V.O.) Because of the spell our Elders cast, the Mogs can only kill us in order. That's the reason I've survived this long. But our enemy is relentless. \nINT. SUV - NIGHT - MOVING \nDaniel is asleep with his earphones on. Henri glances over, his mask of certainty momentarily slips. He looks like a soldier heading into a battle he knows cannot be won. \nDANIEL (V.O.) Now their hunt has turned to me. I am number 4. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. REST-STOP DINER - NIGHT \nA tired neon sign illuminates the big rigs that RUMBLE past, headed to destinations unknown. \nINT. REST-STOP DINER - NIGHT \nDaniel sullenly stares at a stack of untouched pancakes. Henri slides into the booth, all business. \nHENRI Florida's clear. I sent a letter to the school and there's nothing in the papers. \nDANIEL I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye. Henri keeps going, passes an envelope across the table. \nHENRI New IDs. Daniel pulls out his birth certificate, reads the name. \nDANIEL Just when I think you can't get any less original, you lower the bar. \nHENRI I'm not interested in originality. I'm interested in untraceable. There are 335,321 John Smiths in the United States. (Note: from this point on, Daniel will be called John.) John looks at him, then abruptly gets up and storms away. Henri drops $20 on the table and calmly heads after him. \nINT. ARCADE - REST STOP - NIGHT \nA row of ancient arcade games blinks. John angrily stabs the buttons of a Space Invaders machine as Henri approaches. They are alone. John's eyes never leave the video screen. \nJOHN It's been so long since the last scar. \nHENRI You got lulled into a false sense of security. That's my fault. John struggles to keep his temper in check. \nJOHN I liked Florida. I liked having friends. I liked feeling normal. Henri's face softens with paternal compassion. \nHENRI I wish that you could have a normal life -- but you can't. Only now does John turn and face him. His eyes blaze with frustration. \nJOHN Then why fake it? Why not just go hole up in the wilderness. \nHENRI That's exactly what Number 3 did. \nJohn looks at him, confused. Henri pulls up an article on his iPhone and hands it to John. \nHENRI It's from an African news site. A man and his son went missing two nights ago. The locals think they were taken by strange beasts. John understands the implication. \nJOHN Piken. \nHENRI The Mogadorians are natural-born hunters. Blending in is our best protection. \nJOHN So we just keep moving from town to town? \nHENRI Until I say otherwise -- yes. John waits as a TRUCKER passes through the room. His voice softens but never loses its intensity. \nHENRI Don't you worry about it. She nods, grateful. \nANNIE We'll knock it off the rent. Keep the poster, Bernie Kosar brings good luck here in the Buckeye State. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe rain has stopped. The wind RUSTLES the trees. John lifts out the last box. As he closes the trunk, he doesn't notice the hitchhiking gecko hotfoot it out. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT \nHenri is busy setting up his computer station. John dumps the box on the floor. \nJOHN That's the last of them. I'm hitting the sack. \nHENRI I need a new photo first. John crosses and stands against the wall. \nHENRI Say Paradise. John gives him a withering look. Henri flashes off a shot. The camera is cabled to one of the laptops. TIGHT ON LAPTOP: The image of John pixelates onto a digital grid and a face-recognition program begins to map his facial structure. Henri turns to another laptop. \nHENRI I've imputed the new search words: Daniel Jones. Big Pine Key. Sunset High School. You think of any others? \nJOHN Yeah, this place sucks. \nHenri swivels to face him. \nHENRI If there's a story or picture of you on the internet, this program will find it. Our enemy doesn't know who you are -- I want to keep it that way. John nods, knows he's being a jerk. \nJOHN Sand Dollar Beach, that's where we were jet skiing. Henri types it in when something SCRATCHES at the door. Their heads instantly turn towards the sound. Tense SILENCE. SLOW PUSH IN ON THE DOOR as another SCRATCH echoes. Henri is on his feet. He flicks off the lights and silently signals John to retreat down the hall. With the cool air of an assassin, Henri unzips a duffel bag and pulls out a sleek crystal-handled dagger. As he steps to the door... \nINT. CLOSET - JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \n... John crouches in the dark, clutching a baseball bat. Suddenly, the light in the bedroom buzzes back on. He holds his breath as the door swings open. He looks up and is relieved to see Henri. \nHENRI I found our intruder -- he's a little small for a Mogadorian. At that moment, \nA BEAGLE slips between Henri's legs. It cocks its head, studies John's face, then pads forward and licks his cheek. \nINT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe dog greedily laps a bowl of milk. \nJOHN He's starving, doesn't have any collar or tags. \nHENRI Must have been dumped. \nJOHN You know, another pair of eyes and ears watching the house wouldn't be a bad thing. Henri considers the request, nods. John playfully ruffles the dog's head. \nHENRI What are you going to call him? \nJOHN Since I need all the luck I can get -- how about Bernie Kosar? \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - MORNING \nJohn enters, dressed in black, ready for his first day of school. He dumps his backpack on a chair. Henri places a plate with an omelette and perfectly browned hash browns in front of him. \nJOHN Wow. You outdid yourself. What's up? Henri lifts a red backpack into view. John stares at it. \nJOHN I already have a backpack. \nHENRI This one has five days of rations, spare clothes, cash and a handheld GPS. Keep it with you at all times. \nJOHN Henri, come on. \nJOHN Henri, what's happening to me? \nHENRI Calm down. You're going to be okay. John angrily holds up one of his luminescent hands. \nJOHN On what planet is this okay? \nHENRI Yours. \n(BEAT) I need to get you out of here. \nINT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - DAY \nJohn steps out of the darkroom wearing Henri's heavy coat. His hands are balled and stuffed into the pockets. Henri leads him quickly down the hall. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUV - DAY - MOVING \nJohn fearfully studies his hands which have returned to normal, then looks over at Henri who seems oddly calm. \nJOHN Okay, start talking. What the hell's going on? \nHENRI Your first Legacy is starting to manifest. \nJOHN Legacy? \nHENRI An extraordinary ability. Yours is called Lumen. They start a lot sooner on Lorien. I was beginning to fear yours would never emerge. \nJOHN You knew this was going to happen? Why didn't you say anything? \nHENRI I didn't want to worry you. You were already under enough pressure. \n(SINCERE) I'm sorry. John acknowledges the apology, but looks at him, suspicious. \nJOHN What else have you been hiding from me? \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe curtains are drawn. Bernie Kosar dozes on the couch while John and Henri sit at the table, staring at the Box. \nHENRI This couldn't be opened until your first Legacy appeared. Ready? John nods nervously. Henri places the fingertips of his right hand onto five petal-shaped discs inlaid onto the lid. John cautiously follows suit and places his fingers on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpetals\u00e2\u0080\u009d fanned across the opposite side. \nTHE DISCS momentarily glow and a SHARP CLICK echoes from within. John and Henri pull their hands away and watch as the Box miraculously comes to life. Fissures of light sweep across the lines of inlaid stone, dividing the lid into sections that begin to twist and reform like high-tech origami. \nJOHN Whoa. PUSH IN ON Bernie as he sits up and watches the Box unfold. Like an intricate jigsaw, the sections finally regroup, creating a new pattern on the lid. It's a familiar geometric symbol. John touches the crystal pendant that hangs from his neck -- the symbols are an exact match. \nHENRI Open it. John nods, cautiously lifts the lid, revealing a neat assortment of velvet pouches and an array of colored rocks. They range in size and color but all share a serene beauty. \nJOHN What are they? \nHENRI Crystals from Lorien's core. They'll guide us in your training. John tries to reach for one, but Henri slaps his hand away. \nHENRI Place your hand over them. John follows the instruction and is amazed when a walnut- sized crystal floats up from the Box. It slowly begins to spin and project \nA SWIRLING HOLOGRAPHIC GALAXY. \nHENRI Our solar system. Henri points to a planet. Its oceans are dark with pollution and its sprawling continents are barren and treeless. \nHENRI That's what Lorien looked like thousands of years ago. We had all the problems that Earth has today. The planet was dying until our people made a collective decision to change and slowly Lorien began to heal itself -- that's when the Legacies started. John watches as the spinning planet transforms before his eyes. Its oceans turn a vibrant chroma-key blue and the land masses become a lush emerald green. \nHENRI Only a select few developed these abilities. They became known as the Garde. \nJOHN That's what I am? \nJOHN She was returning my backpack. He dumps it by the door. \nHENRI I think you should stay home from school for a couple of days. \nJOHN I'm fine. \nHENRI Just to be safe. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJohn lies on his bed, staring at his luminescent palms, conflicted by his emotions. \nINT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER \nMoonlight cuts across Bernie Kosar who is SNORING peacefully at the end of the bed. John tosses and turns. He finally sits up, unable to sleep. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - DAWN \nNursing a mug of black coffee, Henri diligently scans the laptop screens. He's clearly never gone to bed. He looks up as John enters wearing track gear. \nJOHN I'm going for a run. Bernie trots out and wags his tail pleadingly. \nJOHN Sorry, buddy, you couldn't keep up. \nCUT TO: \nSTART MONTAGE: \nEXT. WOODS - DAWN \nEPIC AERIAL SHOT LOOKING DOWN AT AN EAGLE as it soars above the rich kaleidoscope of trees. It almost seems to be following John, who is powering along a narrow track below. \nCUT TO: John moves at superhuman speed, leaving a blurring wake of leaves. His foot splits a log as he bounds over it. \nCUT TO: John charges towards a secluded stream. It's 30 feet wide. He doesn't slow, leaps off the bank and effortlessly hopscotches from boulder to boulder to the other side. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HILL - DAWN \nIt offers a high-def view of Paradise. John reaches the top and is exhilarated by the sense of temporary liberation. He \nWATCHES AS \nTHE EAGLE alights in a nearby oak tree. John bends to tighten his laces, his eyes fall on the trio of scars branded on his ankle. His happiness dims. \nHe grits his teeth and takes off for home. As he passes the oak, the CAMERA TRACKS TO REVEAL the gecko scampering down the gnarled trunk. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nSam is at his locker. He glances over at John's, hoping he'll show. Disappointed, he joins the crisscrossing throng. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOUSE - DAY \nJohn \u00e2\u0080\u009cpractices\u00e2\u0080\u009d turning his Lumen Legacy \u00e2\u0080\u009coff\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009con\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Henri watches as John's palms glow. \u00c2  John focuses intently, causing them to flare with sudden brilliance. Momentarily blinded, John jerks back and topples off his chair. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nMARK (O.S.) What's he doing in here? John and Sarah spin to find Mark. Sarah is flustered. \nSARAH I thought you were on two-a-days. \nMARK Coach wants me to rest my arm before the scouts come. You didn't answer my question? \nSARAH John was helping me move some boards. John turns to Sarah. \nJOHN I'm going to take off. Mark doesn't take his eyes off John and blocks his way. \nMARK Seriously, Sarah, what's up with this guy? \nSARAH I don't have time for this, Mark. \nMARK But you had time to go to his house the other night. Sarah looks at him, stunned by the admission. \nSARAH You were following me? \nMARK Just trying to figure out what's going on with you. Sarah's shock turns to anger. \nSARAH You've crossed so many lines I can't even speak to you right now. She hustles out of the room. Mark glares at John. \nMARK This isn't over. OFF John, unmoved by the threat... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STILT HOUSE - FLORIDA - DUSK \nThe sky is even pinker than the house. \nINT. STILT HOUSE - FLORIDA - DUSK \nA drawer flies across THE FRAME. The place has been totally trashed. Floorboards have been ripped up. Sofas shredded. Nothing has been spared. CAMERA DRIFTS OVER the debris to... \nINT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - STILT HOUSE - DUSK \nThe mattress has been dissected and its guts lie scattered. \nA TEEN GIRL. kneels in front of John's old desk searching the drawers. She wears a biker jacket, combat boots and has a striking \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon't-fuck-with-me\u00e2\u0080\u009d face. Frustrated in her search, she flings the desk against the wall. It splinters on impact. \nINT. KITCHEN - STILT HOUSE - FLORIDA - DUSK \nTIGHT ON THE STOVE -- a hand twists on the burners. Raw gas HISSES. The Teen Girl makes one final scan, then heads for the door. \nEXT. STILT HOUSE - FLORIDA - DUSK \nThe Teen Girl strides down the steps and crosses to a sleek Ducatti. She slips on a helmet. PUSH IN on her Arctic-blue eyes as they focus on the house with a strange intensity. \nKABBBOOOOOOM! The house detonates. The concussive force of the blast rips the structure right off its stilts. Tornadoes of flame BLAST through the windows as the house catapults into the air. Orange reflections flicker on the Girl's visor as she flips it down, REVS the motorcycle and SCREAM-PEELS down the drive backlit by the glittering inferno... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - DAY \nSam catches John at the lockers. \nSAM Nice freakout the other day. \nJOHN Wasn't feeling well. They twist their combination locks. Sam swings open his door, there's a HISSING POP and \nA RED INK PACK EXPLODES. It's the kind banks use to foil heists. In a shocking instant, Sam and the contents of his locker are splattered. It bears a gruesome resemblance to arterial spray. \nJOHN has his door halfway open and ducks back a second before the ink pack planted in his locker ERUPTS. The spray misses his face but violently spits across his chest and arms. LAUGHTER echoes behind them. John spins and finds Mark and his posse. TIGHT ON John's hands as he balls them and an angry glow flickers through his gloves. \nMARK (to John, taunting) Told you it wasn't over. Behind them, Sam's laid-back persona cracks. He frantically clears his locker, looking for something. He finally pulls out a photo which drips with ink, reels at the jocks. \nHENRI No... go. John looks at him, surprised by this paternal gesture. \nHENRI You've had enough for one day. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MAIN STREET - PARADISE - NIGHT \nA Halloween parade drifts past the CROWDS packing the sidewalks. Icicle lights twinkle in the trees. EXCITED KIDS in costume zigzag past John. It's small-town Americana at its best. ET waddles by holding a JEDI's hand. \nA SLAP ON GLASS. John turns and is amused to find Sam standing among the mannequins in the display window of a sporting goods store. \nINT. ED'S SPORTING GOODS STORE - NIGHT \nAn annoying CHIME plays as the door opens and John enters. The store is deserted. The stock needs to be updated and the shelves could use a dust. Sam approaches wearing an apron. \nJOHN You work here? \nSAM Not by choice. (pointing to sign) Ed's my stepdad. He's under the delusion that if people eat enough candy apples and kettle corn, they'll suddenly have the urge to buy sporting goods. John plucks a hockey mask from the basket on the counter. \nSAM I put those on special tonight for any wannabe Jason Voorhees. Sam pulls off his apron, revealing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cFuture Supervillain\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \nSAM Screw this. Let me lock up. I'll hang with you. He steps to the door and twists the closed sign into view. \nJOHN What about your stepdad? \nSAM He hit the tavern at 6:00. He's already hammered by now. I'll probably find him passed out on the doorstep. Every night is trick \u00e2\u0080\u0098r treat at my house. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nJohn and Sam wander past the parade floats lined up along the road bordering the woods. Stalls sell hot dogs and cotton candy. John subtly scans the crowd. \nSAM She's over there. John follows Sam's gaze and finds Sarah taking shots of some KIDS dunking for apples. She pulls the camera from her eye, sees John and smiles as he approaches. \nSARAH You made it. (re: Sam's shirt) Like the T-shirt, Sam. \nSAM Guidance Counsellor said I need to set goals for myself. Figured I'd aim high. She looks back at John. \nSARAH What do you think of Halloween in Paradise? John regards a particularly over-the-top float. \nJOHN They should pull out all the stops next year. \nSARAH Well, you haven't had the full experience until you've been on the Haunted Hayride. \nShe motions to the picnic area where TEENS are lining up to get on tractor-pulled hay wagons. The wagons lurch through the mouth of a giant cutout devil and into the woods. \nSARAH Give me a sec. She steps to the face-painting booth. It's sponsored by the local realtor who is Sarah's mom, Annie. Sarah hands Annie her camera. Sam whispers to John. \nSAM I'm impressed. Before John can respond, Sarah steps back. \nSARAH You guys ready? \nSAM Three on a wagon might get a little crowded. I'll meet you two on the other side. He gives John a not-so-subtle wink of encouragement. John and Sarah join the end of the line and watch Sam head away. \nSARAH Sam's cool. \nJOHN Definitely unique. \nSARAH I haven't really talked to him since 8th grade. Mark had a tight circle. If you weren't a jock or cheerleader, you didn't exist. \nJOHN I'm glad you broke free. \nSARAH Me too. OFF their growing connection... \nCUT TO: \nSam is waiting by the exit to the hayride when he hears -- \nSARAH (O.S.) (in the woods) Help! Somebody! Something about her terrified tone alerts Sam. \nSAM Sarah? She doesn't answer. He hesitates a moment, then charges into the woods. \nINT. WOODS - NIGHT \nFreaky shadows crisscross as John uses his luminescent palms to navigate his way through the labyrinth of trees. \nINT. CLEARING - WOODS - NIGHT \nSam scrambles blindly through the darkness. \nJOHN (O.S.) \nSARAH! Sam turns in the direction of JOHN'S VOICE. He's about to head towards it when \nTWO ZOMBIE JOCKS trudge into view. Sam darts behind a tree. Suddenly, the area is flooded with preternatural white light. He can hear the sounds of a SCUFFLE and one of the Jocks flies past and CRASHES in a heap while the other SCREAMS. \nJOCK (O.S.) You're blinding me! Stop! Sam cautiously sneaks a peek, shields his eyes with a hand. WHAT HE SEES: John pins the Jock to a tree and holds a luminous palm up to the lenses of the teen's goggles. \nJOHN Where's Sarah? Tell me!! \nJOCK Shepherd Falls. Now turn off that damn flashlight! John rips off the Jock's goggles, then pile-slides him 15 feet into a rotten stump and takes off in a blur of speed. CAMERA STAYS ON SAM. OFF his stunned reaction... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SHEPHERD FALLS - WOODS - NIGHT \nA rocky promontory overlooks a crescent-shaped waterfall which drops into a swimming hole below. The Zombie Jocks carry Sarah into view and dump her in front of Mark. She's wild-cat angry when she sees him. \nSARAH Are you crazy! Where's John? Mark nods the Zombie Jocks away. \nMARK Relax. It's a practical joke. \nSARAH I swear if you hurt him -- \nMARK Why do you give a shit? \nSARAH Get out of my face, Mark, you're pathetic. \nMARK I'm the best thing that ever happened to you and I'm giving you one more chance. Appalled by his hubris, Sarah turns to leave. \nMARK Don't walk away from me! Mark grabs her. Sarah wrenches free, but loses her balance and falls back on the ground. Mark's rage is transplanted by concern. He steps towards her to help when -- \nJOHN (O.S.) Back off! Mark watches John step out. Blood trickles from a cut above John's right eye. \nSARAH John! Are you okay? He nods. Mark looks past him, confused. \nMARK Where the hell are Kevin and Joe? John holds up a clutch of night-vision goggles. \nJOHN They got spooked. \nMARK Hey, those are police property! John flings them over Mark's head into the water. \nMARK I'm going to kill you! With lightning speed, John grabs Mark's arm, spins him, pinning him to a tree. Blinded by rage, John jerks Mark's arm up behind his back. \nSARAH John! Stop! Mark is in real pain. Transfixed with anger, John keeps twisting. Sarah looks at him, pleading. \nSARAH That's his throwing arm! But he doesn't stop until she finally steps forward and slaps him across the face. Startled, John lets go. \nSARAH Football's all he's got. John stumbles back, ashamed, and heads into the woods. Sarah offers Mark a look of disgust and follows after John. \nEXT. TREE LINE - NIGHT \nJOHN I was getting to that. I got a new Legacy. Henri absorbs that revelation. \nHENRI Telekinesis. That's a big step. Must have been triggered by the fight. John doesn't correct him, averts his gaze. \nHENRI I need to teach you how to control these abilities. We'll start working on that tomorrow. The conversation is suddenly interrupted by the repetitive WHINE OF AN ALARM. They cross to the bank of computers. Henri urgently stabs commands into a keyboard. \nJOHN What is it? Henri pulls up a website. \nHENRI We got a hit on one of the search words. \n(SCANNING) It's a paranormal blog. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey Walk Among Us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d ANGLE ON COMPUTER: A video buffers into motion. It's handheld and jerky. It WHIP-PANS over some sand and joins a group of Teens huddled over a figure lying in the surf. He's holding his ankle and light seeps between his fingers. John's chest pounds with fear as he realizes... \nJOHN That's Sand Dollar Beach. \nHENRI Looks like a cell phone camera. There's enough for the Mogs to ID your face. \nJOHN Can you take it down? Henri remains ice calm and starts typing commands. \nHENRI Working on it. \nJOHN I'm sorry, Henri. \nHENRI This isn't your fault. There's still nothing to trace us here. Henri glances up from his screen. \nHENRI This could take all night. Get some sleep. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT \nJohn dumps his hoodie on the floor and slumps on his bed. He pulls his phone out of his jeans and sees a new text message from Sam. He CLICKS it open. \nPUSH IN ON JOHN'S FACE as he scans the message with alarm. He sits bolt-upright, gripped with dread. He checks the message again. \nTIGHT ON PHONE: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI SAW WHAT U DID IN THE WOODS. NEED 2 TALK. \n2NITE. MY GARAGE.\u00e2\u0080\u009d JOHN hits delete and clenches the phone in his palm. A bad night just got worse. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT \nHenri is illuminated by the dirty glow on the computers. His fingers work the keys with expert precision. He's so focused on the task that he doesn't notice \nJOHN blur ACROSS THE FRAME of one of the surveillance camera screens and disappear into the woods. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nJohn cautiously approaches. It's a \u00e2\u0080\u009850s ranch style. The garage adjoins the house. The lights are out. RAIN bullets off the garage door which is partially concertinaed open. \nINT. GARAGE - SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nJohn slides into view. It takes a second for his eyes to adjust. A pickup sits under a white tarp. There's no sign of Sam until he Boo Radley's out of the shadows behind him. \nSAM I've narrowed it down to three possibilities: you're a genetic experiment, you're a freak of nature, or you're an extraterrestrial. \nJOHN I don't know what you think happened tonight... Sam steps closer, watery reflections ripple down his face. \nSAM Your hands lit up like a firefly on crack, you tossed those football players around like crash test dummies, and you took off faster than an Olympic runner. \n(MORE) \nSAM (CONT'D) \n(BEAT) Did I leave anything out? John silently reels. \nINT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - DAY \nThe walls are now adorned with Thanksgiving banners. John and Sam head past the lockers. Mark and the Jocks move out of their way, acknowledging the new high school dynamic. \nINT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - NIGHT \nUsing his telekinesis, John strains to lift a tennis ball. It momentarily RATTLES, then stops. Henri is not impressed. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nBernie darts ahead as John and Sarah walk through a crimson cascade of falling leaves. As they kiss, the leaves around them freeze midair and slowly begin to drift upwards. \nINT. GARAGE - SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nJohn helps Sam with a dusty box. It's stuffed with Sam's dad's old papers and books. We CATCH tantalizing glimpses of images: Stonehenge, Machu Picchu, the Rings of Saturn... \nINT. INTERNET CAFE - NASHVILLE - DAY \nIt's a Vandy student hangout. CAMERA DRIFTS over a row of computer terminals and FINDS the Teen Girl who torched the stilt house. She's studying her computer screen intently. REVERSE TO REVEAL: She is watching the cell phone footage of John on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey Walk Among Us\u00e2\u0080\u009d blog. \nINT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - DAY \nUnder Henri's watchful gaze, John focuses on a tennis ball. It RISES. John grins in triumph, causing the ball to drop and bounce on the floor. Strike two. \nINT. CAFETERIA - PARADISE HIGH - DAY \nMark silently stews when he sees Sarah and John sitting together at a table. \nEXT. BACK YARD - HOUSE - DAY \nBernie pogos on his back legs, trying to bite the tennis ball that John telekinetically hovers just out of the dog's reach. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON A LAPTOP scrolling with endless lines of URL addresses. REVERSE TO REVEAL Henri studying the screen. Waiting. Watching. \nEXT. BACK YARD - HOUSE - DAY \nJohn is fully submerged in an old claw-foot tub. GO TO JOHN'S DISTORTED VIEW LOOKING UP at Henri as he drops a match into the tub. The liquid instantly IGNITES and we realize John's lying in gasoline. He sits up, rests his hands behind his head as the FLAMES harmlessly lick his face. \nINT. BACK YARD - HOUSE - DAY \nThe trees are now bare. John stands 20 feet from Henri and nods. Henri flicks the switch of an automated tennis ball server. John's face is a mask of concentration as the yellow balls fly towards him. He holds up his hand and the balls \nSTOP IN MIDAIR. It's like they've hit an invisible wall two feet from his hand. They hang there. John sees a smile sneak onto Henri's face and momentarily loses focus, causing the wall to collapse and the balls to drop into the mud. \nEND MONTAGE. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nBernie looks like a drowned rat. He's sitting in the tub being scrubbed by John and Sarah. \nSARAH I don't see any family pictures around. I guess the photo aversion is hereditary. He greets the observation with a shrug. She carries on. \nSARAH Your mom... grandparents. Is there anyone else in your life? \nJOHN They died. \nSARAH I'm sorry. \nJOHN It was a long time ago. It's just me and my dad now. John uses a nail brush to clean the beagle's ears. \nSARAH I get the feeling he doesn't like me very much. \nINT. KITCHEN - SARAH'S HOUSE - DAY \nIt's like a Norman Rockwell cover come to life. Every inch of counter space is filled with platters of food. John watches Sarah, Annie, and a boisterous ASSORTMENT OF RELATIVES put the finishing touches to the Thanksgiving feast. KIDS rush in and out in a manic game of tag. John is captivated by the sense of family and celebration -- things he's never known in his own life. Sarah steps over. She's wearing a funky-cool vintage dress. \nSARAH Come on, we're on gravy-boat duty. \nINT. DINING ROOM - SARAH'S HOUSE - DAY \nThe table is decorated with garlands of autumn leaves and an elaborate pine cone centerpiece. Sarah places the last turkey-shaped gravy boat onto the table. She smiles at John. \nSARAH You look dazed. \nJOHN Just taking it all in. She crosses. \nSARAH I'm glad you came. They tenderly kiss until Annie bustles in carrying a steaming bowl of mashed potatoes. \nANNIE Don't mind me. She puts the bowl on the table and grabs Sarah's camera. \nANNIE Let's get a picture of you two lovebirds. Sarah cringes as Annie lifts the camera to her eye. \nSARAH Mom. No. John really doesn't like having his -- \nJOHN It's okay. Let her take it. The gesture means the world to Sarah. He puts his arm around her. Sarah nestles her face against his. As the flash WIPES \nOUT THE FRAME... \nCUT TO: \nINT. DINING ROOM - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nRed candles flicker. Sarah's DAD is expertly carving the turkey. Everybody is at the table. John sits next to Sarah. She holds his hand under the table. It's Hallmark worthy until the carriage clock on the mantel CHIMES. \nIT'S SIX O'CLOCK. \nJohn looks at his phone. No messages. His brow creases with concern. He turns to Sarah, whispers. \nJOHN I need to check in with Henri. He exits. \nEXT. FRONT PORCH - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nJohn speed dials as he steps out into the cold. He holds the phone to his ear. It rings three times and then is answered. \nJOHN \n(INTO PHONE) Henri? CLICK. The call is hung up. Suddenly on edge, John redials. This time it's picked up immediately. \nJOHN \n(INTO PHONE) Henri? \nMAN (V.O.) \n(OVER PHONE) Are you one of them too? John reacts to the chilling menace of the Man's tone. \nJOHN \n(INTO PHONE) Who are you? Where's Henri? CLICK. John jerks the phone from his ear and stares at it, panicked. He paces, desperate and unsure, then gets an idea and punches another number. \nJOHN \n(INTO PHONE) I need your help. \nINT. DINING ROOM - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe food is getting cold. Everybody is waiting for John. Sarah catches her mother's disapproving look. \nHe squats in front of the door. He holds up a luminescent palm and uses it like a flashlight to sweep the interior. WHAT HE SEES: Take-out boxes litter the filthy counter. The sink is swamped with dirty dishes. The light washes across a semiautomatic sitting by a packet of Lucky Strikes. \nSAM (O.S.) See anything? Annoyed, John spins and finds Sam creeping towards him. \nJOHN I told you to go! \nSAM They might know where my dad is! John realizes Sam is determined. He sweeps his hand back over the kitchen door. His palm illuminates a familiar \nCRYSTAL-HANDLED DAGGER. It's lying on the counter by the fridge. \nJOHN Henri's here. John \u00e2\u0080\u009cturns off\u00e2\u0080\u009d his palm and reaches for the door handle. Sam anxiously swats his arm away. \nSAM Wait! Other than strength, speed and night-light, what powers have you got? \nJOHN Telekinesis -- but that's a work in progress. \nSAM No invisibility, X-ray vision, flight? \nJOHN Sam, we drove here. Sam takes a deep breath, psyching himself up. \nSAM Okay. I'm ready. Let's do it. But as John reaches for the door handle, the kitchen light suddenly turns on and a MAN enters. He's built like a wrestler and goes by the name of FRANK. \nINT. KITCHEN - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT \nWith a Lucky Strike clenched between his lips, Frank picks up the packet on the table and is pissed to discover it's empty. He crushes it in his fist and crosses to the door. \nEXT. BACK PORCH - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT \nJohn and Sam are gone. Frank steps out and locks the door. He flicks away his cigarette as he heads down the stairs. CAMERA FOLLOWS the butt as it cartwheels into \nSAM'S LAP. He's crouched next to John at the side of the porch. He frantically begins trying to extinguish the stub. John clamps his hand over Sam's mouth and snuffs the cigarette between his fingers. Once Frank's safely around the corner, John releases his hand. The duo silently climbs onto the porch. John squats in front of the door. His hand shakes as he holds it out towards the lock and concentrates. \nSAM Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. There's a LOUD CLICK. \nSAM You just dead bolted it! Way to go! \nJOHN New plan -- follow Lucky Strike. Text me if he comes back. Sam sneaks off after Frank. \nINT. KITCHEN - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT \nTIGHT ON LOCK as the dead bolt turns by itself and the door swings open. John cautiously crosses the threshold. He holds up his right hand, dims his palm to a dull-blue glow. He retrieves Henri's dagger and tentatively heads into... \nINT. HALL - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT \nEverything is filmed with dust. It's freezing and John's BREATH FOGS in the hazy aura his palm casts. The naked floorboards CREAK. Fear bites as John scans the lifeless gloom, not sure where to start. TIGHT ON HIS SHOE as it brushes a mousetrap. SNAP! \nHis breath catches in his throat. He \u00e2\u0080\u009cturns off\u00e2\u0080\u009d his hand. His heart thumps as he waits for something to react to the noise. But nothing does. As his eyes adjust to the dark, he notices a rectangle of light faintly leaking from the door that leads down into... \nINT. BASEMENT - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe ancient stairs sag as John slowly descends. The space is illuminated by a single naked bulb. The sound of DRIPPING WATER hammers the silence. John scans the rabbit warren of rooms and sees a figure chained to a chair in the corner. \nJOHN Henri! He races over. But as he reaches for Henri's gag, a YOUNG MAN steps out of the shadows holding a baseball bat. John turns too late and the bat strikes his left side. He drops the dagger as he falls to the floor, his ribs searing. The man, BRET, raises the bat again. John focuses his mind. \nTHE BAT whips out of Bret's grip and torpedoes towards John -- who ducks out of the way as the bat flies past. Confused, Bret lurches forward. John scrambles for the bat, clenches it in his hand, and swings it into the young man's legs. \nBRET knocks the light as he topples into a column and CRASHES onto the cement, out cold. It's over in a violent blur. John sits stunned for a moment. The swinging bulb casts surreal shadows as he spins back to Henri, telekinetically \u00e2\u0080\u009cunlocks\u00e2\u0080\u009d the padlock securing the chains, and rips off the gag. Henri is groggy and his face is swollen from brutal beatings. \nHENRI You shouldn't be here. \nJOHN Your life is my life, remember? Henri tries to shake his drug-induced haze. \nHENRI I talked my way in. Thought the big guy was buying it. He rubs a wound on his neck. \nHENRI I was asking him about the video when the other one shot me from behind... some sort of animal tranq. \nA MOGADORIAN \nclimbs out of a black SUV and storms towards them. \nSAM Hurry up! John's brow is furrowed with concentration. The Mog unsheathes his sword as he runs. With a superhuman leap, he lands on the hood -- TWAAAAACK! John and Henri spin out of the way as the sword SHATTERS the windshield and impales in the back of the seat, missing them by a mouse hair. As the Mogadorian withdraws the sword to strike again, Henri sweeps up his dagger and stakes it into the Mog's neck. \nVRRRROOMMM! The engine ROARS to life. The Mogadorian tumbles off the hood, magenta light spurting from his wound. John turns to Sam, who is petrified, and SCREAMS... \nJOHN \nDRIVE! Sam wrenches the shaft into gear and floors the gas. The Mogadorian EVISCERATES in a frenzy of embers. The truck bursts through the blizzard of sparks and STREAK-PEELS away. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BASEMENT - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT \nCAMERA TRACKS the swish of a familiar red coat as its owner slowly descends the stairs, PANS UP PAST his right hand, which methodically twists two meditation balls, TO REVEAL \nTHE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER. He's the one who slaughtered Number 3 in Africa. His men part as he steps into view and crosses to Frank and Bret who are chained to chairs. A Soldier stands behind each one. Frank looks at the Commander in terror. \nFRANK I called you like I said. It's not my fault they got away! The Commander steps into the moonlight that seeps through the window. We get our first good look at his face. A gnarled scar runs down his right cheek, identifying him as the same Mogadorian Henri wounded in the escape from Lorien. His skin is deathly pale and his eyes have a cold purple tint. \nMOGADORIAN COMMANDER Where did they go? \nHis accent is thick and his voice is unnerving. \nFRANK How should I know? The kid had me pinned to the ceiling. The Commander turns to Bret. \nMOGADORIAN COMMANDER Where did they go? Bret is too freaked to even speak. The Commander nods to the Soldiers. They grab Frank and Bret by the heads and yank open their mouths. Frank watches in confused terror as the Commander holds one of the meditation balls. \nDOZENS OF TINY RAZOR-BLADES suddenly flower open across its surface and viciously spin. With cold-blooded calm, the Commander drops the ball into Frank's mouth. OFF its terrible DRILL-LIKE WHIR... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STRIP MALL - DAWN \nVermillion clouds streak the heavens. Sam's truck pulls up next to Henri's SUV, which is inconspicuously parked in front of a 24-hour pharmacy. \nINT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAWN \nJohn turns to Sam. \nJOHN We'll meet you back at the house. \nHENRI We're not going back to Paradise. \n(TO SAM) Thank you for your help, but you'll never see us again. Henri climbs out. Sam looks at John, confused. \nSAM Is he serious? John nods, numb. \nSAM What am I supposed to tell people? \nJOHN Nothing. Forget about us. We never existed. \n(BEAT) Goodbye, Sam. OFF Sam as John climbs out... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOTEL - DAY \nIt's a rundown dump on the bleak edge of a no-name town. \nINT. SUV - DAY \nJohn silently stews. BIKERS smoke at the edge of the grimy pool which is drained for the winter and rattles with frozen leaves. Henri steps out of the motel office with a key. \nSARAH What happened last night? I've tried calling him all day. But his number's no longer in service. \nSAM Forget about him, Sarah. Incredulous, she grabs his arm. \nSARAH I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. \nSAM He left with Henri and he isn't coming back. Ever. \n(PULLING FREE) I'm sorry. OFF Sarah, shattered... \nCUT TO: \nINT. SHOWER - MOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON \nJohn stands under the steaming spray. Eyes screwed shut. Naked and lost. TWO LOUD KNOCKS at the door. \nHENRI (O.S.) \n(THROUGH DOOR) Taillights in five. \nEXT. MOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe GROUP OF BIKERS by the pool has grown four fold. They're partying hard. Henri keeps his head down as he passes. \nINT. MOTEL OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe FEMALE CLERK stares at the TV mounted on the wall. She's watching a local news report about the Warsaw house murders. Henri enters. The window RATTLES as a motorcycle speeds past and he slides his key onto the counter. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON \nHenri steps in and is annoyed to hear the SHOWER still running. He strides to the bathroom door. \nHENRI John? No answer. He KNOCKS. Still nothing. \nINT. BATHROOM - MOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON \nHenri shoulder-rams the door open. He whips back the shower curtain and stares at the empty tub. \nJOHN IS GONE. OFF Henri's grim concern... \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK \nThe sky is twilight blue. A gleaming Harley ROARS around the bend, going full throttle. John is on its back. The wind whips his hair. Eyes set forward. Headed back to Paradise. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nAnnie opens the front door and is surprised to find John. \nANNIE Little late for dessert. \nJOHN I need to talk to Sarah. \nANNIE She's not here. Some friends dragged her to a party at Mark Jayne's. John absorbs this news, turns. Annie steps out after him. \nANNIE I don't usually pry into my daughter's love life, I certainly didn't want my mother in mine -- but Sarah's my youngest and she's special to me. \nJOHN She's special to me too. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nINT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nSam is at the kitchen counter, watching the YouTube video on his laptop, when headlights bleed through the blinds. \nEXT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nSam steps out and reacts in surprise as Henri emerges through the headlight glare. \nHENRI John's not at the house. Is he here? \nSAM No, but he's all over the internet. \nHENRI I know. He turns back to his SUV. Sam follows. \nSAM Those things from Warsaw -- they're coming, aren't they? \nHENRI Go back inside. This isn't your fight. \nSAM The hell it isn't. I'm coming with you. OFF this declaration... \nCUT TO: \nINT. SCHOOL OFFICE - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nThe crystal pendant glints against John's chest as he grabs a \u00e2\u0080\u009cParadise High\u00e2\u0080\u009d sweatshirt from a supply closet and yanks it on. Sarah's phone suddenly RINGS, startling them. \nSARAH \n(INTO PHONE) Hello. She listens, then hands John the phone. \nSARAH It's Henri. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. SUV - NIGHT - MOVING \nHenri careens through the night with Bernie and Sam. \nHENRI \n(INTO PHONE) Where are you? \nJOHN High school. \nHENRI Get out now! At that moment, all the POWER in the school DIES and the headlights of an SUV flash across the window. Fear registers in John's eyes as he realizes... \nJOHN Too late... they're here. \nEXT. SUV - NIGHT \nThe Commander climbs out. Mark follows but is distracted as a trio of black SUVs speeds into the lot followed by a tractor trailer from which inhuman GROWLS echo. \nMARK What the hell's in there? He looks back at the Commander who is arming up from the trunk of the SUV. Mark glimpses the arsenal of future-tech machine pistols, double-bladed swords and heavy-duty daggers. He backs away in fearful realization. \nMARK You guys aren't FBI. Before he can run, a Mogadorian Soldier grabs him by the neck and constrains him. The Commander pulls \nTWO BANDOLIERS over his broad shoulders. The cartridges are made of crystal and swirl with purple light. Finally, he slips on his trademark red coat and spins towards the school. \nINT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nOne of John's hands holds Sarah's while the other lights their way as they hurtle down the passage. They've almost reached the doors when they suddenly fly open and \nA FIGURE \nstruts into view. We RECOGNIZE her as the mysterious Teen Girl. She swings up an awesome hand-cannon and FIRES right at them. THE BLAST scorches the air between John and Sarah but takes out the \nJOHN This isn't your fault -- it's mine. He offers Mark his hand. Mark shakes it. Suddenly, Bernie begins to GROWL. \nSAM What is it, boy? Henri sees where Bernie is staring and realizes... \nHENRI He's telling us to run! They take off a second before \nA PIKEN PUMMEL-RAMS through the wall in a shower of bricks, books and paper. It utters a glass-shattering ROAR. John looks back and sees Bernie bravely holding his ground. \nJOHN Bernie! He watches as the beagle sprints forward and launches himself at the monster. Bernie clamps onto the Piken's neck. He's hopelessly outmatched and holds on for dear life as the Piken tries to buck him off. Then something amazing happens -- \nBERNIE BEGINS TO MORPH. He doubles, triples in size and keeps growing. His features become reptilian, gecko-like, his fur turns to spines and in a matter of moments Bernie has transformed into a hulking \nALIEN CREATURE. John looks to Henri as the truth of Bernie's origin dawns. \nHENRI Bernie's a Chimera. He came with us from Lorien. \nJOHN Guess I wasn't the only one keeping secrets. \nHENRI Somebody had to watch you when I wasn't around. They exit while Bernie and the Piken continue to battle. \nINT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nJohn and Henri catch up to the others. \nSARAH The gym's this way. A projectile HISSES past John's ear and DETONATES a row of lockers -- BOOOOOM! -- it's like an incendiary grenade. The paint blisters off the lockers as they are consumed by FIRE. \nJOHN sees two Mogadorian Soldiers hauling heavy-duty weapons that use the glass cartridges that glow on their ammo belts. One FIRES another round. John telekinetically RIPS a door off its hinges. It flies forward, blocks the charge and IGNITES. John spins back and SCREAMS -- \nJOHN Go! Go! Go! They take off. John follows and uses his telekinesis to fling cabinets, doors, benches anything he can to block the fiery onslaught. But the rounds are coming too fast and a projectile SMACKS him in the back. It's like being hit by napalm. As FLAMES wash across him, he looks up and snaps on \nTHE SPRINKLER HEADS that run the length of the hall. A deluge sprays, dousing the fire. With his clothes smoking, John tears around the corner. The Mogadorians charge after him, but find \nSIX IS WAITING. BOOOOMM! BOOOOMM! She blasts them at point-blank range. Magenta light gushes from their wounds. Like rain hitting hot coals, their bodies HISS as they crack and cinder. \nSIX Keep moving! Henri, Mark, Sarah and Sam race out of view. Then John sees something emerge through the smoky, water-choked haze. \nIT'S THE SECOND PIKEN! It utters a low, predatory GROWL and launches itself forward. Oddly, Six doesn't move. She closes her eyes and lays one hand on the flooded floor, turning the water to \nICE! \nIn a matter of moments, the hall has been transformed into an icy tunnel. The sprinklers spray snow. The Piken struggles to find purchase in this new frozen environment and slip- slides after John and Six, who disappear into... \nINT. CAFETERIA - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nCRAAAAACK! The doors are DEMOLISHED as the Piken flails off the ice. It takes out a row of tables and chairs and skids to a stop. It ROARS in humiliated FURY, and its red eyes scan for John and Six who are nowhere to be seen. The Piken prowls behind the serving counter. Snow beads off its back. Its monstrous nostrils suddenly flare, sensing something. It hunches lower and peers at the trays and pans that are stored below. REVEAL JOHN AND SIX. They're invisible. John clutches Six's arm. They're lying between a stack of roasting dishes. Threads of foamy drool drip onto their faces as the Piken pokes its head further. Its ghoulish red eyes seem to stare right at them. With a final frustrated SNORT, it carries on. \nINT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nHenri, Sarah, Sam and Mark race into view. Sarah stops, panicked and afraid. \nSARAH Where's John? \nHENRI Right behind us. He offers her his hand. She's about to take it when \nA MOGADORIAN SOLDIER steps out of the shadows. There is nowhere and no time for Henri and the others to run. But as the Mogadorian squeezes the trigger of his hand-cannon, the wall on his right \nERUPTS! Bernie and the first Piken crash into the hall. They are still at each other's throats and don't even notice as they steam-roller over the Mogadorian, squashing him like a bug. The creatures SMASH through the opposite wall and out of sight. It's over in a violent blink. \nINT. KITCHEN - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nJohn and Six sneak through the shadows. She steps to the door, but it won't budge. \nSIX They've blocked it. Use your telekinesis. \nJOHN We're not leaving without my friends. \nHe makes no attempt to flee as the Piken charges. As it springboards into the air... ANGLE ON JOHN'S HANDS -- as they suddenly clench. ANGLE ON THE GOALPOSTS -- as they're SNAPPED clean off their bases and fly skyward. ANGLE ON JOHN -- as the Piken's shadow washes across him. ANGLE ON THE PIKEN -- as it arcs towards John with its mouth open and teeth bared. Suddenly, the goalposts spear its flanks, impaling it like supersize BBQ forks. The three-ton killing machine drops out of the sky and smacks onto the 20-yard line. John watches impassively as the red life-fire dies in its eyes and its head lolls to one side. \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nThe stadium looms in the distance. Sam wrenches the dagger from Six's shoulder while Sarah and Mark anxiously watch. \nEXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nJohn sinks by Henri's side. \nJOHN Henri. Henri GROANS as John cradles his head. His coat is soaked with blood and his torso is horribly mauled. John tries to drag him to his feet. \nJOHN Come on, taillights in five. \nHENRI I won't be coming with you this time. Save yourself. \nJOHN We go together! Henri smiles, grateful, but at that moment \nTHE COMMANDER'S SWORD flies past John and impales Henri in the chest. Henri utters a GROAN and his dying eyes meet John's. \nHENRI Find the others. His voice is a GRAVELLED WHISPER. \nHENRI Your life is my life... always. His eyes flutter closed and he slips from John's grip. Anguished, John doesn't notice his pendant momentarily flicker with a radiant blue light. He angrily spins to face \nTHE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER. But in a blur of speed, the Commander steps forward, wraps his hand around John's throat and plucks him into the air. He's flanked by the remaining Soldiers. John's feet kick uselessly as he's lifted face to face. \nMOGADORIAN COMMANDER Number 4. Three Loric pendants dangle from the Commander's belt like mocking trophies. \nMOGADORIAN COMMANDER Your Cepan saved you on Lorien. The Commander's voice hisses with cruel certainty. He wrenches his sword from Henri's corpse. \nMOGADORIAN COMMANDER But this moment was inevitable. The blade shimmers with silver flame as he raises it. John's eyes narrow as the sword sweeps towards him. This is the moment his adolescence officially ends. This is the moment when a warrior is born. ANGLE ON BLADE as it SHATTERS into a million pieces, which flutter to the ground like glittering confetti. John stares at the alien with calm confidence. \nJOHN Nothing is inevitable. \nANGLE ON JOHN'S HAND AS IT IGNITES. The flame is hotter and brighter than 10,000 acetylene torches. He grips one of the Commander's bandoliers. TIGHT ON THE MOGADORIAN'S FACE as he realizes it's over. The glass cartridges detonate in a deadly chain reaction. \nIT'S LIKE A NUCLEAR IMPLOSION! \nJohn, the Commander, the Mogadorian Soldiers, in fact every goddamn thing in the stadium is obliterated in the \nSUPERNOVA OF FIRE that radiates across the field like a blinding ring of hell. \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nSarah looks back as the blistering vortex of flame lights the night sky. Her breath catches in her throat. \nSARAH Oh my God... John. Before anyone can stop her, she takes off running, sprinting for the stadium. \nEXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nIt's a smoking ruin. The seats have melted into puddles. Sarah bursts into view. She looks across the devastated field. The grass has been reduced to a charred black carpet of stubble. Nothing remains of Henri or the Mogadorians. \nSARAH John! She charges across the broiled expanse, hoping against hope. Then she sees John, lying motionless and naked, his clothes completely burned away. She stops, puts her hand to her mouth to stifle a sob, when he COUGHS and stirs. \nSARAH John! Ash swirls like snow as she races to his side. They wrap each other in their arms. Neither wanting to ever let go. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PICNIC AREA - WOODS - DAWN \nThe sky is cracked with the first light of day. Sarah is dressing Six's wound at a table. Six winces. \nSARAH Sorry, Girl Scout first aid didn't cover extraterrestrial dagger wounds. Six smiles, grateful. \nSIX Thanks. \n", "test1_input": "SAM You were talking to Sarah Harte. \nJOHN She was talking to me. \nSAM Mark and Sarah have been exclusive since Freshmen year. \nJohn looks down the hall and sees Mark wrap his arm around Sarah's shoulder. \nSAM If there's another guy in her airspace, he shoots them down. You got a warning shot. John piles the books into his locker. \nJOHN Maybe I'll fire back next time. \nSAM Look, you're new, so let me tell you how things work in this misnamed backwater. Football players are gods -- the rest of us are mere mortals. If you want to survive, keep your head down and don't make waves. \nJOHN You sound like my dad. \nSAM Obviously a wise man. \n(BEAT) I'm Sam by the way. Sam extends his hand.

The Junior gym class jogs around the track. John hangs in the middle of the pack, with his hoodie up, blending in. They pass the GIRLS who are stretching on the pristine field. Sarah's eyes drift towards John. The COACH blows a whistle. \nCOACH Alright, people. Let's hit the gym. The assembled teens GROAN and fan off towards the mouth of a tunnel that stares out from the base of the bleachers. \nINT. GYM - PARADISE HIGH - DAY \nJohn emerges from the tunnel via a door by the stage. Some of his classmates are on the court, passing and dribbling. \nCOACH Okay, half court, three on three. Girls have this basket, boys have that one. \nCUT TO: Two simultaneous games are in progress. John sits on the sidelines waiting his turn. He avoids eye contact with Sarah who is sitting in the shadow of the basket. However, he does notice Mark Jayne enter and approach her. \nCOACH New kid, you're up. Show me what you've got. John steps onto the court and waits for the ball to come his way. He steals a glance and sees Sarah and Mark arguing. A blur of orange. John swings back and catches the ball. Just as he shoots, he's distracted by Sarah's upset voice. \nTHE SHOT goes wild, misses the basket but hits the glass backboard with such force that it \nSHATTERS. Mark and Sarah are inadvertently forced to separate as shards rain down. All eyes turn to John, who's annoyed at his momentary lapse. TEENS HOOT. The Coach BLOWS his whistle. \nCOACH Enough! Hit the showers. \n(TO JOHN) LeBron, grab a broom. As the gym empties, John looks over and catches Sarah watching him. OFF this silent exchange... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOUSE - DAY \nTHE INTRICATELY CARVED BOX is clutched in Henri's hands. He heads down the hall and stops in front of the grandfather clock. Its tarnished pendulum sways. He unlocks the glass panel and slots the Box out of sight behind the clock's brass face. \nSatisfied with the hiding place, he locks the front and takes the key. When he turns back, he finds \nBERNIE KOSAR. The dog is studying him with his head cocked. \nHENRI Let's keep this our little secret. OFF Bernie's inquisitive eyes... \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAFETERIA - PARADISE HIGH - DAY \nJohn joins the line. He sees Sarah sitting by herself, inspecting a photographic contact sheet. His view is blocked by Sam. John rubs his hands which are oddly sweaty. \n", "test1_true": "JOHN It was an accident. \nSAM I hear the real spectator sport was Mark and Sarah's blowout. John wipes his brow, distracted. \nSAM Dude, you okay? \nJOHN Fine. At that moment, Mark Jayne and his buddy, KEVIN, cut in front of them. Annoyed, John taps Mark on the shoulder. \nMARK You got a problem? \nJOHN Line starts back there. \nMARK Football players get priority. \nJOHN Where's that posted? \nMARK Unwritten rule. \n(RE: SAM) I'm surprised your boyfriend didn't tell you. Sam puts his hands up and backs away. Mark smirks at John. \nMARK If you don't know your place around here, things can get rough. John holds his ground. \nJOHN In that case, I guess I better ask you where I should sit. I was thinking about grabbing that chair next to your girlfriend. In a flash of anger, Mark whips up his tray, hammers it into John's chest, knocking him to the floor. \nMARK You want to talk trash? Let's see you back it up. John tries to stand, but is suddenly overcome with a wave of pain. He looks down at his hands and is alarmed to see \nLIGHT blooming from his palms! He quickly balls them into fists, extinguishing the light from view. \nMARK Get up! SILENCE has fallen. Still clenching his fists, John rises and stumbles out into the hall. OFF Sarah's concern as she watches him exit... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PORCH - HOUSE - DAY \nHenri is on a ladder, adjusting a hidden surveillance camera above the front door, when Bernie starts BARKING. It's an anxious, urgent BARK. \nINT. HOUSE - DAY \nHenri steps inside and sees the dog is BARKING at -- \nTHE GRANDFATHER CLOCK. A shaft of white light blooms from within. The shadow of the swaying pendulum cuts across Henri's face. As he sprints for the door... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - DAY \nDisoriented, John staggers down the hall. Sam catches up. \nSAM Dude, hold up! John leans against the wall, keeping his hands out of sight. \nSAM You look like crap. I'll get the nurse. But as Sam runs off, John heads in the other direction. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nHenri's SUV roars into view, whipping up a tornado of leaves. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DARKROOM - PARADISE HIGH - DAY \nStrips of negatives hang on drying lines. John bursts in and SLAMS the door. He slips off his backpack, opens his hands. TIGHT ON HIS EYES -- the brilliant light from his palms shrinks his irises to pinpricks. The luminescence is crisp, mercury-glass bright and grows stronger every second. Suddenly, the door opens. John spins in shock. A figure strides through the blinding glare, gently takes his hands and folds them into fists. \nIT'S HENRI. John looks at him, confusion and fear etched on his face. \n", "test1_id": 1614, "test2_input": "INT. SUV - DAY \nJohn climbs in. \nHENRI Wasn't that your friend from the other night? \nJOHN Her name's Sarah. \n(ANNOYED) I didn't ask for a ride home. \nHENRI Principal called. Said there was an incident. \nJohn stares out the window, guilty. \nJOHN A guy was messing with me. I took care of it. Problem solved. \nHENRI You're stronger and faster because of Earth's gravity -- you shouldn't use that advantage to settle petty scores. \nJOHN It was no big deal. Don't blow it out of proportion. \nHENRI You can't risk everything over wounded pride. \nJOHN I wasn't looking for a fight. It just happened. Get off my back. Henri pulls a printout from his coat. John unfolds it. ANGLE ON PRINTOUT: It's from the Florida Keynoter website and features a photo of the charred stilt house. John's gut churns as he stares at the image. \nHENRI Article says it was arson. \nJOHN We were clean. There's no way the Mogs can track us here. Henri shakes his head, shifts into gear and starts off. \nHENRI They can track us anywhere. I think it's time you saw what you're really up against. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GARAGE - DAY \nSunlight razors across workbenches cluttered with rusty tools. Henri and John stand in the middle of the space. \nTHE BOX \nis open on the floor between them. John lifts his hand and holds it over the crystals. \nONE RISES. It's white and as thick as two fingers. It floats in front of John's face. He tentatively reaches out. When he grips it, a shock wave of light blasts out, totally WIPING OUT THE FRAME and transporting him into \nA VISCERAL MEMORY. \nEXT. LORIEN - NIGHT \nEXPLOSIONS rock and the SCREAMS of the dying echo. AN OLD MAN hustles A TERRIFIED BOY through the murderous bombardment. The air is choked with ash and smoke. The boy is 7-year-old John. The man is his grandfather. Young John glances up and sees \nAN ARMADA OF BATTLESHIPS eclipsing Lorien's two moons. The angular hulls of the craft are scarred from galactic battles new and ancient and unleash an endless crisscrossing FRENZY OF MISSILES. \nGRANDFATHER (in Loric with subtitles) Keep moving. \nEXT. TEMPLE - NIGHT \nIt wouldn't look out of place in ancient Rome. Young John and his grandfather race up the steps. \nINT. SANCTUARY - TEMPLE - NIGHT \nA statue of Lorien's most famous warrior, Pittacus Lore, towers in the middle of the chamber. His noble face is illuminated in a shaft of flame-tainted moonlight. \nFOOTSTEPS ECHO! Young John and his grandfather scramble across the space and straight into the path of \nTWO MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS. The Soldiers' pallid faces flash with smiles. Swords drawn, they move in for the kill when one is skewered in the throat by a crystal-handled dagger. \nMAGENTA LIGHT \n", "test2_true": "A CLOAKED FIGURE. It's a violent battle of wills which ends when the Cloaked Figure kicks up the dead Soldier's sword and impales it into the Mogadorian's chest. The Soldier EVISCERATES in a cloud of HISSING cinders. Young John watches in awed terror as the Cloaked Figure steps towards him and pulls back his hood. \nIT'S HENRI. He looks younger, the years of hiding have aged him. John's grandfather lifts a familiar crystal pendant from his neck and places it over Young John's head. \nGRANDFATHER This is your Cepan. Go with him. \nYOUNG JOHN No! \nHENRI Your life is my life now. I will always protect you. \nGRANDFATHER \n(TO HENRI) He must survive. A BLAST scorches across the space. Henri spots \nA MOGADORIAN COMMANDER hunkered behind a column, his red coat billows behind him like a curse. \nGRANDFATHER They are already hunting you! Go! Henri plucks a crystal ankle-dagger from his boot, grabs young John and charges up. As the Commander breaks cover, Henri hurls the dagger. \nTHE COMMANDER dives out of its path but ROARS as the blade SPARK-RIPS across his right cheek like a hot poker. \nEXT. TEMPLE - NIGHT \nHenri yanks Young John by the hand. They take off in one direction while John's grandfather heads off in the other. \nA MOGADORIAN TRANSPORT CRAFT suddenly swoops between them. The HOWLS of its occupants ricochet through the night. The heat from its engines washes the ground, warping the destruction like a ghastly mirage as two bay doors open. Young John looks back through the heat- haze and catches a impressionistic view as \nTWO PIKEN leap out. Their reptilian bodies ripple with muscle and their oversize heads glint with raptor-like jaws. The Piken mercilessly rip into John's grandfather. Young John races to help, but Henri wrenches him back. CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHT ON YOUNG JOHN'S FACE as he screams... \nYOUNG JOHN Nooooooooooo! THE MEMORY ENDS and we... \nMATCH CUT TO: \nINT. GARAGE - DAY \nTIGHT ON JOHN screaming... \nJOHN Nooooooooooo! He drops the crystal and stumbles back. The experience has left him traumatized. Henri steps towards him, but John is too overwhelmed and runs out. \nEXT. STREAM - WOODS - DAY \nA stone angrily SKIPS across the water. John is about to toss another when Bernie Kosar trots into view. He ruffles the dog's fur but doesn't turn when Henri steps out of the woods and crosses to his side. \nJOHN I saw my grandfather. I saw what you did to the Mogadorians -- you saved my life. \nHENRI A lot of Lorics sacrificed their lives so that you could live. \nJohn is still trying to process the memory. \nJOHN He said I must survive. \nHENRI The Elders had a plan. You weren't on that ship by chance. The nine of you were chosen for a reason. Even if only two of you live, together you'll pose a grave threat to our enemy. Consumed by bitterness, John hurls another stone. \nJOHN You saw what they did to Lorien. How can nine or six or two of us take on that army? It's hopeless. Henri knows he has to pull him out of this mournful funk. \nHENRI I never thought we'd get off Lorien alive -- but we did. I didn't know how we could survive on a strange planet -- but we have. I gave us six months before the Mogs found us -- it's been 10 years. Don't give up now. Henri grips John's shoulders. \nHENRI You have the potential to do great things. Even if you don't see it -- I do. \nJOHN How can you put so much faith in me? \nHENRI Because your life is my life. If you quit, then everything I've worked for and sacrificed is meaningless. \n(BEAT) Remember -- nothing is inevitable. The fragile SILENCE is broken when John's cell phone BLEATS. He scans a text. \nJOHN It's Sarah. The Block Party's tonight. I'll say I can't make it. Henri sees John is wracked with doubt and confusion. \n", "test2_id": 1615, "test3_input": "INT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nIt's total chaos. Smoke and FLAMES plume up from the basement. Terrified Teens scramble. John thrashes through the crowd, SHOUTING -- \nJOHN Sarah! \nEXT. BACK YARD - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe panicked evacuation spills out. A window EXPLODES and orange flames lick the cold night air. John sees Emily stumble out clutching one of Mark's dogs, Abby. \nJOHN Where's Sarah? \nEMILY Went back for Dozer. Another EXPLOSION rocks. A COUPLE of drunk Jocks CHEER. John looks back at the house. The fire has taken hold with incredible speed. The living room curtains are ABLAZE. \nA DOG'S HAUNTING HOWL \ncuts over the sound of the HISSING FLAMES. It's coming from the second floor. John charges past Mark, towards the house. \nMARK It's too late. You can't get through! John ignores him and runs into the inferno. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nFLAMES sprint up the walls and clouds of black smoke spew from the sectional sofa. Immune to the heat, John heads into the front hall and finds \nTHE STAIRCASE is fully engulfed. Fearless, he clambers up the flaming steps. His jeans and shirt catch fire. He's almost reached the top when the staircase BREAKS AWAY behind him and DISINTEGRATES in a cloud of embers. \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALL - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nIt's a raging conflagration. The family portraits blister on the walls. John beelines towards Dozer's PLAINTIVE WAIL which reverberates over the UGLY ROAR of the fire. \nINT. GUEST ROOM - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nSarah is crouched by the heavy oak bed that dominates the corner of the room, COUGHING, eyes burning from the smoke and heat. Dozer is cowered underneath, HOWLING. Sarah desperately tries to move the bed but it won't budge. \nCRAAAACK! The door rips off its hinges. Through the smoky half-light, Sarah watches as John strides into the room, heroically backlit by flame. \nSARAH John! \n(FRANTIC) Dozer's under the bed. He's too scared to come out! John strides forward, grips the bed with one hand and effortlessly hoists it. Sarah looks at him, amazed, then scrambles forward and gently scoops Dozer into her arms. John puts the bed back down. \nJOHN Don't let go of him. I promise I won't let go of you. \nAs he lifts them... \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALL - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe trio heads into the hall just as an 8-foot section of the floor collapses in front of them. Unfazed, John sprints forward and bridges the hole. ANGLE ON SARAH as she stares at the burning chasm in terror and grips Dozer tighter. John touches down on the other side and doesn't slow as he powers down the hall, which is a SHRIEKING tunnel of fire. \nA BURNING BEAM breaks free and swings down in front of them. Sarah SCREAMS, but watches in stunned amazement as John sweeps it out of the way with a telekinetic flick of his hand. \nEXT. SIDE - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe second-floor window SHATTERS as John leaps out holding Sarah and Dozer. A ROARING tongue of fire whips his back as he drops to the ground and touches down with Sarah and Dozer. COUGHING and shell-shocked, Sarah puts the dog down. \nJOHN You okay? She stares at him, unsure. \nSARAH You walked through that fire without getting burned. I saw you stop that beam. SIRENS wail in the distance. \nJOHN I'll explain everything... but not here... (offering his hand) Sarah... please? As they take off into the woods, the IMAGE FREEZES, then REWINDS. John and Sarah kneel in the shadows, then FLY BACKWARDS up through the window and INTO the burning house. REVERSE TO REVEAL the Red-Haired Teen watching playback on his FlipVideo camera, amazed. He runs to the back of the house and finds Mark. \nRED-HAIRED TEEN \n(RE: VIDEO) Check this out, man! PUSH IN as Mark stares at the footage, stunned. \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_true": "John and Sarah walk in SILENCE, dappled in moonlight. He catches her staring at him. \nJOHN Please don't look at me like that. \nSARAH I'm sorry. I'm still trying to process everything I saw and I keep coming to the same conclusion -- what you did isn't possible. \nJOHN It is for me. \nSARAH Who are you? (off his hesitation) For once please tell me the truth. It's the hardest thing he's ever had to do. \nJOHN My name isn't John. I don't have a name, just a number. 4. In fact, my whole life can be reduced to numbers: like 15 million -- that's how many light years it takes to get from my planet to Earth. 38 -- that's how many towns I've lived in. Or 3,671 -- that's how many days I've been running from an enemy that wants me dead. I lied to you, Sarah, because I lie to everyone. That's how I stay alive. Tears of relief brim as he finally reveals his soul. \nJOHN I shouldn't be telling you any of this. It's dangerous. Emotionally spent, John leans against a tree. She steps towards him and brushes her hand down his cheek. \nSARAH I don't care. I just want to be with you. \nJOHN I want that too. But if I stay you could get hurt. I have to leave to keep you safe. Sarah absorbs the bitter reality, reaches for his hand. \nSARAH There's something I want to give you first. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DARKROOM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nA PHOTOGRAPH OF SARAH AND JOHN sharpens INTO FOCUS. It's the one Annie took of them at Thanksgiving. John and Sarah stand in the eerie red glow. She gently tongs the image into a bath of fixing solution. \nSARAH So you'll always remember me. With exquisite tenderness they kiss. John's palms shimmer. The intensity of the luminescence builds with their rising passion. They sink to the floor and the light crescendos in an ethereal flash that BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe spinning lights of a trio of fire trucks FLARE THE LENS. CREWS hose down the last smoking embers. A DEPUTY approaches Mark, who is standing by a police cruiser. \nDEPUTY The FBI showed up flashing their badges. Wanna talk to you. As he points to a black SUV that's parked down the street. \nINT. SUV - NIGHT \nMark climbs in the back. He looks around nervously as the vehicle starts off. \nMARK Where are we going? Is this about the fire? It was an accident. \nOnly now do we REVERSE TO REVEAL \nTHE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER sitting in the back. His face is masked in shadow. \nMOGADORIAN COMMANDER We're hunting for one of the guests at your party. He holds up a netbook which flashes with the FlipVideo footage of John's rescue of Sarah. It's posted on YouTube. \nMOGADORIAN COMMANDER Do you know this boy? \nMARK Yeah, John Smith. But I didn't invite him. \nMOGADORIAN COMMANDER He's a fugitive. We've been tracking him for some time. Mark smirks, vindicated. \nMARK I'll help you find him. He points to Sarah's image on the screen. \nMARK He's not at Sarah's, I already checked. And one of my dad's deputies drove by his house -- nada. \nMOGADORIAN COMMANDER He poses a great threat to us. Where else could he be? Mark pulls out his cell phone. \nMARK I've got Sarah's cell number, maybe you guys can trace it? The Commander takes the phone and passes it to one of his men in the front. He looks back at Mark. \nMOGADORIAN COMMANDER Tell me everything you know about John Smith. \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_id": 1616}

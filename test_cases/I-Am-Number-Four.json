{"test1_input": "HENRI Don't you worry about it. She nods, grateful. \nANNIE We'll knock it off the rent. Keep the poster, Bernie Kosar brings good luck here in the Buckeye State. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe rain has stopped. The wind RUSTLES the trees. John lifts out the last box. As he closes the trunk, he doesn't notice the hitchhiking gecko hotfoot it out. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT \nHenri is busy setting up his computer station. John dumps the box on the floor. \nJOHN That's the last of them. I'm hitting the sack. \nHENRI I need a new photo first. John crosses and stands against the wall. \nHENRI Say Paradise. John gives him a withering look. Henri flashes off a shot. The camera is cabled to one of the laptops. TIGHT ON LAPTOP: The image of John pixelates onto a digital grid and a face-recognition program begins to map his facial structure. Henri turns to another laptop. \nHENRI I've imputed the new search words: Daniel Jones. Big Pine Key. Sunset High School. You think of any others? \nJOHN Yeah, this place sucks. \nHenri swivels to face him. \nHENRI If there's a story or picture of you on the internet, this program will find it. Our enemy doesn't know who you are -- I want to keep it that way. John nods, knows he's being a jerk. \nJOHN Sand Dollar Beach, that's where we were jet skiing. Henri types it in when something SCRATCHES at the door. Their heads instantly turn towards the sound. Tense SILENCE. SLOW PUSH IN ON THE DOOR as another SCRATCH echoes. Henri is on his feet. He flicks off the lights and silently signals John to retreat down the hall. With the cool air of an assassin, Henri unzips a duffel bag and pulls out a sleek crystal-handled dagger. As he steps to the door... \nINT. CLOSET - JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \n... John crouches in the dark, clutching a baseball bat. Suddenly, the light in the bedroom buzzes back on. He holds his breath as the door swings open. He looks up and is relieved to see Henri. \nHENRI I found our intruder -- he's a little small for a Mogadorian. At that moment, \nA BEAGLE slips between Henri's legs. It cocks its head, studies John's face, then pads forward and licks his cheek. \nINT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe dog greedily laps a bowl of milk. \nJOHN He's starving, doesn't have any collar or tags. \nHENRI Must have been dumped. \nJOHN You know, another pair of eyes and ears watching the house wouldn't be a bad thing. Henri considers the request, nods. John playfully ruffles the dog's head. \nHENRI What are you going to call him? \nJOHN Since I need all the luck I can get -- how about Bernie Kosar? \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - MORNING \nJohn enters, dressed in black, ready for his first day of school. He dumps his backpack on a chair. Henri places a plate with an omelette and perfectly browned hash browns in front of him. \nJOHN Wow. You outdid yourself. What's up? Henri lifts a red backpack into view. John stares at it. \nJOHN I already have a backpack. \nHENRI This one has five days of rations, spare clothes, cash and a handheld GPS. Keep it with you at all times. \nJOHN Henri, come on. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. PARADISE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nJack-o'-lanterns stare out from the \u00e2\u0080\u009cHALLOWEEN BLOCK PARTY\u00e2\u0080\u009d banner strung across the red brick facade. Henri drives away. John slides the red backpack onto his shoulder when he hears a FAMILIAR BARK. He turns and is surprised to find \nBERNIE KOSAR. The little dog is sitting by the flagpole wagging his white- tipped tail. John crosses to him, baffled. \nJOHN Bernie, what the hell... were you hiding in the car? He scoops the dog into his arms. \nFEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Hey, I was about to take a picture of the little guy. John turns and finds \nSARAH HARTE. She's his age and is holding an old 35mm Nikon. There is something about her unforced beauty that is instantly enchanting. John shuffles, uncharacteristically nervous. \nJOHN He's not supposed to be here. \n(TO BERNIE) Go home. Now. Bernie hops out of his arms and obediently runs towards home. \nSARAH He's really well-trained. How long have you had him? John turns away. \nJOHN Sorry about your shot. \nSARAH No worries. He begins walking towards the entrance. \nSARAH You just moved into the house on Old Mill Road. It's John, right? \nJohn swings back, concerned. \nSARAH Don't worry, I'm not stalking you. My mom said she rented it to a guy with a son my age. Since I know every other face on this quad, that had to be you. \n(BEAT) I'm Sarah. He nods. \nSARAH Where are you from? \nJOHN Someplace warmer. \nSARAH I don't think that qualifies as an actual answer. \nJOHN I need to register. She raises her camera to snap a shot of him. \nJOHN Whoa. What are you doing? \nSARAH Capturing your first day, even though you're technically six weeks late. \nJOHN Please don't point that at me. \nSARAH Afraid the camera's going to steal your soul? She lifts the viewfinder to her eye, adjusts focus. Annoyed, he covers the lens with his hand. \nJOHN What's your problem? I said no. \nSARAH It's only for the yearbook. John regains his composure. \nJOHN I'm not big into having my picture taken. Sorry. As he heads away, Sarah watches, intrigued. CAMERA TRACKS TO REVEAL MARK JAYNE monitoring the encounter. He's the star quarterback and his chiselled jaw tenses with jealousy. \nINT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nLoaded with textbooks, John instinctively bows his head as he passes the black eye of a hall security camera and steps to a locker. He reaches for the combination lock when \nA BACKPACK viciously sideswipes him. The textbooks scatter across the checkerboard linoleum. John sees the culprit is Mark Jayne, who offers him a taunting grin. John fights his urge to react and watches as Mark struts over to his POSSE OF JOCKS. \nVOICE (O.S.) Welcome to Paradise, irony not included. John looks at the teen standing two lockers down. He's got a battered skateboard tucked into his backpack and wears an Army surplus jacket. This is SAM GOODE -- genius by birth, slacker by choice. He nods after Mark. \nSAM His name's Mark Jayne. Quarterback, sheriff's son, he's three years into the best four years of his life. John begins retrieving the fallen books. Sam helps. \nSAM Do yourself a favor -- stay off his radar. \nJOHN Didn't know I was on it. \n", "test1_id": 1614, "test2_input": "Sam is waiting by the exit to the hayride when he hears -- \nSARAH (O.S.) (in the woods) Help! Somebody! Something about her terrified tone alerts Sam. \nSAM Sarah? She doesn't answer. He hesitates a moment, then charges into the woods. \nINT. WOODS - NIGHT \nFreaky shadows crisscross as John uses his luminescent palms to navigate his way through the labyrinth of trees. \nINT. CLEARING - WOODS - NIGHT \nSam scrambles blindly through the darkness. \nJOHN (O.S.) \nSARAH! Sam turns in the direction of JOHN'S VOICE. He's about to head towards it when \nTWO ZOMBIE JOCKS trudge into view. Sam darts behind a tree. Suddenly, the area is flooded with preternatural white light. He can hear the sounds of a SCUFFLE and one of the Jocks flies past and CRASHES in a heap while the other SCREAMS. \nJOCK (O.S.) You're blinding me! Stop! Sam cautiously sneaks a peek, shields his eyes with a hand. WHAT HE SEES: John pins the Jock to a tree and holds a luminous palm up to the lenses of the teen's goggles. \nJOHN Where's Sarah? Tell me!! \nJOCK Shepherd Falls. Now turn off that damn flashlight! John rips off the Jock's goggles, then pile-slides him 15 feet into a rotten stump and takes off in a blur of speed. CAMERA STAYS ON SAM. OFF his stunned reaction... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SHEPHERD FALLS - WOODS - NIGHT \nA rocky promontory overlooks a crescent-shaped waterfall which drops into a swimming hole below. The Zombie Jocks carry Sarah into view and dump her in front of Mark. She's wild-cat angry when she sees him. \nSARAH Are you crazy! Where's John? Mark nods the Zombie Jocks away. \nMARK Relax. It's a practical joke. \nSARAH I swear if you hurt him -- \nMARK Why do you give a shit? \nSARAH Get out of my face, Mark, you're pathetic. \nMARK I'm the best thing that ever happened to you and I'm giving you one more chance. Appalled by his hubris, Sarah turns to leave. \nMARK Don't walk away from me! Mark grabs her. Sarah wrenches free, but loses her balance and falls back on the ground. Mark's rage is transplanted by concern. He steps towards her to help when -- \nJOHN (O.S.) Back off! Mark watches John step out. Blood trickles from a cut above John's right eye. \nSARAH John! Are you okay? He nods. Mark looks past him, confused. \nMARK Where the hell are Kevin and Joe? John holds up a clutch of night-vision goggles. \nJOHN They got spooked. \nMARK Hey, those are police property! John flings them over Mark's head into the water. \nMARK I'm going to kill you! With lightning speed, John grabs Mark's arm, spins him, pinning him to a tree. Blinded by rage, John jerks Mark's arm up behind his back. \nSARAH John! Stop! Mark is in real pain. Transfixed with anger, John keeps twisting. Sarah looks at him, pleading. \nSARAH That's his throwing arm! But he doesn't stop until she finally steps forward and slaps him across the face. Startled, John lets go. \nSARAH Football's all he's got. John stumbles back, ashamed, and heads into the woods. Sarah offers Mark a look of disgust and follows after John. \nEXT. TREE LINE - NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "SARAH John! Wait. Sarah catches up. \nSARAH I'm sorry, I didn't want you to break his arm. \nJOHN I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at myself. She stops, faces him. \nSARAH I had no idea Mark would pull something like that. He has seriously gone off the deep end. \nJOHN The guy's in love with you. Wants you back. \nSARAH That's not love. Their eyes meet in the moonlight. \nSARAH Walk me home? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nIt's a picture-book perfect neighborhood. Most of the houses are festively decorated with front-yard graveyards and cobweb- festooned trees. John walks with Sarah. They come to the prettiest house on the block. \nSARAH This is me. John stares at the dozen jack-o'-lanterns arranged on the porch. They glare back with flickering bucktooth grins. \nSARAH I know. Wait until the Christmas decorations go up. My mom decks the halls with so many lights, you can see our house from space. Stray TRICK-OR-TREATERS race past. She motions to the cut above his eye, concerned. \nSARAH You should see a doctor. \nJOHN For this? Wouldn't waste their time. She looks at him, curious. \nSARAH You're not going to tell me how you took out those football players, are you? \nHe says nothing. She smiles. \nSARAH I really don't get you. She steps closer. \nSARAH But I feel like I can trust you. \nJOHN You can. The air is charged. \nSARAH Good night. Sarah swings open the white picket gate. \nJOHN Wait. As she turns back, John steps forward and kisses her. Although taken by surprise, Sarah quickly succumbs to his passion. However, as their kiss intensifies, \nTHE JACK-O'-LANTERNS rise and hover in midair. Sarah has her back to them, but when John's eyes momentarily flicker open, he sees the orbs grinning back. Startled, he pulls away from her. \nTHE PUMPKINS instantly drop and SMASH onto the porch, their candles blowing out on impact. Sarah spins and stares at the jack-o'- lanterns, pulp oozes through their cracked shells. Suspicious, she slowly turns, looks at John for an explanation. He does his best to cover his stunned reaction. Fat drops of RAIN begin to fall. John puts up his hood. \nJOHN I better go. OFF Sarah, watching him melt into the downpour... \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT \nRain HAMMERS. Bernie is asleep on a blanket. John creeps into the darkness, soaked to the bone, when -- \nHENRI I heard on the police scanner that eight boys were beaten up in the woods tonight. Henri turns on a light, nursing a mug of coffee. Bernie wakes. John pulls off his hood. Henri looks at the cuts and bruises on John's face. \nJOHN They won't talk. \nHENRI That was a stupid thing to do. What were you thinking? \nJOHN They attacked me. If I hadn't defended myself, I'd be in the ER right now. Would that have been the better choice? \n(STEPPING FORWARD) You've got to start trusting me! Emotionally charged, John points his finger at Henri, accidentally causing the mug to telekinetically \nEXPLODE. Coffee and shards splatter across the floor. Henri looks at John, stunned. John shrugs sheepishly. \n", "test2_id": 1615, "test3_input": "JOHN This isn't your fault -- it's mine. He offers Mark his hand. Mark shakes it. Suddenly, Bernie begins to GROWL. \nSAM What is it, boy? Henri sees where Bernie is staring and realizes... \nHENRI He's telling us to run! They take off a second before \nA PIKEN PUMMEL-RAMS through the wall in a shower of bricks, books and paper. It utters a glass-shattering ROAR. John looks back and sees Bernie bravely holding his ground. \nJOHN Bernie! He watches as the beagle sprints forward and launches himself at the monster. Bernie clamps onto the Piken's neck. He's hopelessly outmatched and holds on for dear life as the Piken tries to buck him off. Then something amazing happens -- \nBERNIE BEGINS TO MORPH. He doubles, triples in size and keeps growing. His features become reptilian, gecko-like, his fur turns to spines and in a matter of moments Bernie has transformed into a hulking \nALIEN CREATURE. John looks to Henri as the truth of Bernie's origin dawns. \nHENRI Bernie's a Chimera. He came with us from Lorien. \nJOHN Guess I wasn't the only one keeping secrets. \nHENRI Somebody had to watch you when I wasn't around. They exit while Bernie and the Piken continue to battle. \nINT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nJohn and Henri catch up to the others. \nSARAH The gym's this way. A projectile HISSES past John's ear and DETONATES a row of lockers -- BOOOOOM! -- it's like an incendiary grenade. The paint blisters off the lockers as they are consumed by FIRE. \nJOHN sees two Mogadorian Soldiers hauling heavy-duty weapons that use the glass cartridges that glow on their ammo belts. One FIRES another round. John telekinetically RIPS a door off its hinges. It flies forward, blocks the charge and IGNITES. John spins back and SCREAMS -- \nJOHN Go! Go! Go! They take off. John follows and uses his telekinesis to fling cabinets, doors, benches anything he can to block the fiery onslaught. But the rounds are coming too fast and a projectile SMACKS him in the back. It's like being hit by napalm. As FLAMES wash across him, he looks up and snaps on \nTHE SPRINKLER HEADS that run the length of the hall. A deluge sprays, dousing the fire. With his clothes smoking, John tears around the corner. The Mogadorians charge after him, but find \nSIX IS WAITING. BOOOOMM! BOOOOMM! She blasts them at point-blank range. Magenta light gushes from their wounds. Like rain hitting hot coals, their bodies HISS as they crack and cinder. \nSIX Keep moving! Henri, Mark, Sarah and Sam race out of view. Then John sees something emerge through the smoky, water-choked haze. \nIT'S THE SECOND PIKEN! It utters a low, predatory GROWL and launches itself forward. Oddly, Six doesn't move. She closes her eyes and lays one hand on the flooded floor, turning the water to \nICE! \nIn a matter of moments, the hall has been transformed into an icy tunnel. The sprinklers spray snow. The Piken struggles to find purchase in this new frozen environment and slip- slides after John and Six, who disappear into... \nINT. CAFETERIA - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nCRAAAAACK! The doors are DEMOLISHED as the Piken flails off the ice. It takes out a row of tables and chairs and skids to a stop. It ROARS in humiliated FURY, and its red eyes scan for John and Six who are nowhere to be seen. The Piken prowls behind the serving counter. Snow beads off its back. Its monstrous nostrils suddenly flare, sensing something. It hunches lower and peers at the trays and pans that are stored below. REVEAL JOHN AND SIX. They're invisible. John clutches Six's arm. They're lying between a stack of roasting dishes. Threads of foamy drool drip onto their faces as the Piken pokes its head further. Its ghoulish red eyes seem to stare right at them. With a final frustrated SNORT, it carries on. \nINT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nHenri, Sarah, Sam and Mark race into view. Sarah stops, panicked and afraid. \nSARAH Where's John? \nHENRI Right behind us. He offers her his hand. She's about to take it when \nA MOGADORIAN SOLDIER steps out of the shadows. There is nowhere and no time for Henri and the others to run. But as the Mogadorian squeezes the trigger of his hand-cannon, the wall on his right \nERUPTS! Bernie and the first Piken crash into the hall. They are still at each other's throats and don't even notice as they steam-roller over the Mogadorian, squashing him like a bug. The creatures SMASH through the opposite wall and out of sight. It's over in a violent blink. \nINT. KITCHEN - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nJohn and Six sneak through the shadows. She steps to the door, but it won't budge. \nSIX They've blocked it. Use your telekinesis. \nJOHN We're not leaving without my friends. \n", "test3_true": "SIX I broke the Elders' spell to find you. The Mogs can kill me now. We have to go. \nJOHN We stay and fight. OFF his determination... \nINT. HOME ECONOMICS ROOM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nHenri and Sam crouch behind one station while Sarah and Mark hide in the one opposite. Henri pulls a selection of weapons from the backpack. He hands one to Sam, looks over at Mark. \nHENRI You know how to use one of these? \nMARK My dad's the sheriff. He slides two across the floor. The door opens. They swing up to fire but find -- John and Six. \nJOHN Save it for the Mogs. Let's go! \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nBernie and the Piken pummel the rows of lockers which COLLAPSE like dominos. Gashed and exhausted, the battling duo SHATTER-SMASHES into \nTHE SHOWER STALLS. Water SPURTS from a broken pipe. The Piken slips on the slick tiles. As it struggles to right itself, Bernie seizes the moment and sinks his fangs into the monster's neck. \nTHE PIKEN \ndesperately thrashes. Its talons viciously rip into Bernie's side. Ignoring the pain, Bernie doesn't let go until his foe finally jerks to stillness. As Bernie sinks to the floor, he MORPHS back into a beagle and lies spent and bleeding... \nINT. GYM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nJohn leads the group past the bleachers and points to the side of the stage. \nJOHN The door's over here. The tunnel leads out to the stadium. Sarah sweeps back the curtain, revealing a padlocked set of metal doors. John holds up his hand, snaps the lock and whips the chain free. The doors fly open, \nTWO MOGADORIANS spring out of the dark. One tackles Henri while the other blindsides John. Henri struggles until \nBOOOOOM! The BLAST cinders the Mog's head clean off. Henri looks over and sees Mark holding a smoking shotgun and nods his thanks. The second has John pinned when it suddenly ROARS in agony and disintegrates into a shower of sparks, revealing \nSIX. She sheathes her dagger and helps John up. \nSIX Saving your life. My new hobby. Sarah notices a smile of respect flicker between John and Six. PHHHHHHT! PHHHHHHT! PHHHHHHT! -- three Mogadorian knives razor the air. One impales Six in the shoulder. She slumps at John's feet. Henri opens FIRE on the \nTHE COMMANDER AND TWO MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS who storm towards them. John SCREAMS to Sam and Mark. \nJOHN \n(RE: SIX) Get her down the tunnel! They grab Six by the arms and drag her into the tunnel. Sarah glances back at John and follows after them. Henri takes out a Soldier. John sweeps up his hand and \nTHE WOODEN FLOOR OPENS LIKE A ZIPPER! The Commander and the other Soldier are sent flying as the planks rip free of their nails. John and Henri charge into the tunnel. The doors fly shut behind them and the bleacher stand rolls forward to seal the entrance. \nINT. TUNNEL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nSarah is in the lead. Sam and Mark follow, holding the wounded Six. They've almost reached the end when \nA MOGADORIAN lurches into the mouth of the tunnel. Without a second's hesitation, Sam swings up his gun and BLASTS it. Mark looks at him in shock as they race through the embers. Sam shrugs. \nSAM I play a lot of Xbox. \nEXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT \nSam, Mark, Six and Sarah hurtle across the field. When they reach the track, Sarah looks back and smiles with relief when John and Henri burst out of the tunnel. \nJOHN Don't stop! Get to the woods! She nods and exits with the others. John and Henri head onto the field after them when \nTHE SECOND PIKEN leaps out of the mouth of the tunnel behind them. It's seriously pissed. It bounds straight towards John. Its fangs glint like barbed wire as it launches itself towards him. At the last second, \nHENRI nobly shoves John out of the way and is plucked into the Piken's jaws. The creature shakes him like a rag doll and flings him 50 feet down the field. John watches, anguished, as Henri lands in a heap. \nJOHN Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo! The Piken pivots, turns its crimson eyes on John. It almost seems to smirk. Its fangs are stained with Henri's blood. John's face hardens into a mask of rage. \n", "test3_id": 1616}

{"train": "THE AMERICAN \nWritten by \nRowan Joffe \nBased on the novel A Very Private Gentleman \nby \nMartin Booth \nDraft 2.1 \nFADE IN: \n1   EXT. DALSLAND, SWEDEN- TWILIGHT                            1 \nA lake. \nA forest. \nA dacha. \nA Saab outside the dacha. \nA light within. \n2   INT. DACHA- NIGHT                                          2 \nJACK (dark, fit, mid-forties) is staring at the embers of a log fire. He sips from a thick cut crystal glass of whiskey. \nThe impressive US Army Special Forces crest tattooed on the shoulder of his bare torso is at odds with JACK's quiet manner and the distinguished silver that flecks his hair and stubble. JACK is no longer young. \nA creak behind him and his eyes flick over his left shoulder. \nINGRID (34) is naked. With an intimate familiarity she kisses JACK on the top of his head, sits close behind him and wraps her arms around her lover, linking her slender hands across his upper chest. \nHer head resting on his shoulder, her face beside his, INGRID and JACK watch the fire together in easy silence. \n3   EXT. WOODS- MORNING                                        3 \nINGRID leads JACK through the trees. Her coat has a white fur collar. They are fresh-faced and warm from bed. \nThey head towards a vast and frozen lake. \nJACK senses something in the woods. \nBeneath the Conifers: impenetrable darkness. \nJACK looks around. \nThick snow blankets the world and muffles any sound. There is not the slightest breeze. \nINGRID What are you looking for? \nHer Swedish accent is sing-song. \nJACK Nothing. \nHis anxiety is evident. \nINGRID laughs out loud. \nINGRID There are no wolves in the woods so close to the city. \nJACK smiles. \n4   EXT. LAKESIDE- MORNING                                        4 \nThey continue through the woods until they reach the shoreline of the lake. \nINGRID steps onto the ice. \nHolds out her hand. \nA beat. \nJACK takes INGRID's hand. \nSolid as stone, the frozen lake takes his weight. \nThey walk out, INGRID slipping and laughing. \nThe landscape is magical. \nJACK begins to relax, slipping and swearing. \nSuddenly, he stops. \nThere are footprints in the thin snow going out across the lake. \nINGRID Snow-hare. \nBeside the Snow-hare's prints are those of a man. \nINGRID A hunter? \nJACK studies the two sets of tracks. \nThose of the Snow-hare are heading out into the lake. The man's prints are heading in the opposite direction, towards the shoreline. \nJACK spins around in the direction they've just come from. \nNo one. \nThen, about ten metres inland from the edge of the lake, a low branch dips and a thick rug of snow falls from the branch. \nJACK grabs INGRID, yanks her towards the cover of the lakeside trees and pushes her down into the snow. \nShe grunts, winded. He lies besides her. \nAt a fast food stand not far from the central train station, a middle-aged man is squirting ketchup on a hotdog. \nIt is Autumn, and without the usual mass of Summer tourists, LARRY stands out as an American. \nJACK does not. \nJACK Blending in? \nLARRY is shocked to see JACK but pretends the hot dog is the centre of attention. \nLARRY Jack. What brings you to Rome? \nJACK I closed the Stockholm account. \nLARRY might be older than JACK but he doesn't seem it. His demeanour is sprightly. \nJACK But there were complications. \nThen LARRY turns and walks, eating carefully. He is not a man who likes to get his hands dirty. \nJACK walks beside him. \nBoth men keep a trained eye on their surroundings. \nJACK Collateral damage. Two shooters. Unidentified. [A beat] And a girl. \nLARRY takes a bite of his hot dog and casts a sideways look at JACK. \nJACK is tired. \nLARRY There's a bar across the street: the L'Aquila. Freshen up. Sit tight. Give me two hours. \n10   INT. BAR- DAY                                                10 \nJACK washes his face in the cramped bathroom at the back of the bar. \nIn the background, on the stereo, The White Stripes cover One More Cup of Coffee. \nJACK stares at himself in the mirror. He looks exhausted. \n11   INT. BAR- DAY                                                11 \nJACK is sitting at the back of the bar. He has a good view of the whole establishment: including the entrance and the door to the bathrooms. \nHe lights a cigarette. \nLARRY comes in and sits opposite him. \nLARRY (genuinely shocked) You started smoking again? \nJACK exhales. \nJACK Guess so. \nLARRY Since when? \nJACK Since now. \nThe WAITER slides over and flicks a cloth at the table. \nWAITER Cafe? \nLARRY Due. \nThe WAITER disappears. \nA beat. \nLARRY puts an ENVELOPE on the table. \nLARRY Stockholm account. Final installment. \nJACK takes the envelope and puts it in an inside pocket. \nLARRY is about to speak but stops. \nThe WAITER reappears and puts down two cups of coffee. \nLARRY puts two cubes of sugar in his cup and starts stirring. \nThen speaks low and fast: \nLARRY You can't stay here, Jack. You won't see `em coming, not in a big city. But you can't go far, either. If the gentlemen whose accounts you closed belonged to Brink, Gallazzo, Simenov- any of the first division- you have four or five hours at most before every airport, train station, bus stop, toll booth and ski lift from Stockholm to Skopje is under surveillance. \nJACK smokes. \nJACK So. \nNot a question. An acknowledgement that LARRY knows exactly what he's talking about. And JACK is listening. \nLARRY So. You find a hole- somewhere nearby- and you crawl into it and you stay put until I say it's safe to come out. \nJACK's expression is as immoveable as a cliff face. \nLARRY Turn right outside the bar then second left. Via Spinetti. You'll find a silver Citroen C2 with Chieti plates. Check the glove box and follow the map. Castelvecchio. It's a fucking fortress. Literally. And as dead as a graveyard. Anyone within a three to five mile radius you'll see `em coming. \nHe pushes something across the table. A MOBILE PHONE in a cellophane bag. \nLARRY Get there. Stay there. \nLARRY finishes his coffee and dabs at the corners of his mouth with a napkin. \nLARRY Do nothing `till you get my call. \n12   INT. CAR- DAY                                               12 \nJACK gets into a compact Citroen C2: nothing flash. \nHe opens the glove compartment and finds a PLAIN MANILLA ENVELOPE. \nInside the envelope is: \nLARRY (V.O.) Do you have any idea how long I've been trying to reach you? What happened to the cell I gave you? \nJACK speaks quietly, keeping an eye on the town square: \nJACK Did I forget to mention my electromagnetic hypersensitivity? \nLARRY (V.O.) Don't get jumpy on me, Jack. That cell was secure. \nJACK lights a cigarette. \nLARRY (V.O.) I've got a job. It's a custom fit. You don't even have to pull the trigger. \nJACK Who's the client? \nLARRY (V.O.) Relax. She triple checks out. Plus she comes to you. You don't have to move an inch. \nJACK This is a small town, Larry. I don't like small towns. I grew up in one. Besides, I'm already attracting attention. \nLARRY (V.O.) So will anyone who's trying to kill you. \nThis is a good point. \nJACK lights a cigarette. \nJACK I'll think about it. \nLARRY (V.O.) Think about this. I cleaned up your shit and made you disappear. You owe me my usual twenty percent commission plus the first installment. The rest is yours. After this you're free. \nOn JACK. \nTurning over the word. \n31   INT. FATHER BENEDETTO'S HOUSE- MAGIC HOUR                    31 \nThe SUN is sinking behind the high mountains that overlook the hilltop town. \nJACK is wearing an immaculate white linen shirt. \nHe's sitting in a small walled garden snuggled at the rear of a crumbling fifteenth century edifice, overlooked yet secluded and trapping the last rays of the sun. \nFATHER BENEDETTO pours two large glasses of brandy from a globulous green bottle of ARMAGNAC and sniffs his drink like a honey bee hovering over a bloom. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Que siamo! The quality of the brandy is good, the liquor is smooth and the glass warmed by the sun. \nHe pronounces warmed \"war-med\". His English is sophisticated but quaint, like an out-of-date book. \nJACK sniffs his drink before he sips it. Not like a connoisseur: like a White House taster checking the safety of a Presidential beverage. \nFATHER BENEDETTO (in ENGLISH) The only good thing to come from the Francesi, everything else... \nFATHER BENEDETTO grimaces. \nFATHER BENEDETTO The French are... pezzi di merda. This is not an American discovery. Italians have known this for centuries. [In ITALIAN] When Rome called France the province of Gaul, they were just the same. Arrogant sensualists. Their cuisine is fussy and their wine effeminate. Only their brandy is worthy of any attention. \nFATHER BENEDETTO looks at JACK. \nFATHER BENEDETTO (in ENGLISH) Forgive me. I speak too fast. You study our history? \nJACK No. \nFATHER BENEDETTO looks horrified. \nFATHER BENEDETTO You come to Italy to make a guide book and you don't care about history? \nJACK I take pictures, father. \nA beat. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Of course. You are American. You think you can escape history. You live for the present. \nA beat. \nJACK likes this man. His shrewdness is disconcerting but humane. \nJACK sips his brandy. \nJACK I try to, father. \n32   EXT. L'AQUILA- EVENING                                       32 \nSuburban sprawl with a mediaeval heart. L'AQUILA is the capital of the Abruzzo region and the nearest big town to Castel del Monte and Castelveccio. \nLike these two villages L'AQUILA is relatively isolated, nestled high up in the Appenine mountains. \n33   EXT. L'AQUILA, SHOPPING STREET- EVENING                      33 \nJACK comes out of a SUPERMARKET carrying two bags of groceries and turns quickly down a dark side street. \n34   EXT. L'AQUILA, VIA LAMPEDUSA- EVENING                        34 \nJACK passes a sign for a MODELLING AGENCY. It's a small, inconspicuous sign, but it catches his eye because its graphics are subtly lewd and it's attached to the buzzer of what is otherwise a purely residential apartment block. \nEntering the apartment block is a beautiful twenty four year- old Italian girl. \nCLARA. \nShe catches JACK's eye. \nHe walks on. \n35   INT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT 35 \nThe remnants of a simple yet sophisticated meal: apple, pecorino cheese, honey and walnuts. \nOn his lap top, JACK has organised several weeks worth of PHOTOGRAPHS of CASTEL DEL MONTE into three categories: \n1. Street plan \n2. Exit routes/car \n3. Exit routes/foot \nShe takes a long time to answer. When she does, she does so over the rim of her half-empty coffee cup, scanning the crowd like a cheating wife customarily anxious not to be seen by her husband. \nMATHILDE One fifty to one seven five meters. \nJACK Time? \nMATHILDE Five seconds. Seven at the most. \nJACK Targets? \nMATHILDE One. \nJACK Fire rate? \nMATHILDE Rapid. \nJACK Magazine capacity? \nMATHILDE Large. Preferably 9mm Parabellum. \nThe WAITER delivers the Spremuta and the raspberry ice-cream. \nThe glass of lemon juice twists in MATHILDE's slender fingers. \nMATHILDE The weapon must be fairly light. And compact. Possible to be broken down into its constituent parts. \nL'AMERICANO How compact? \nMATHILDE As compact as possible. \nJACK clears his throat. \nJACK You want a submachine gun to fit in a lady's purse? \nMATHILDE A small vanity case would be permissible. \nJACK A small briefcase would be possible. \nA beat. \nJACK X-rays? Camouflage: lap-top, DVD player, MP3 or digital camera? \nShe's not sure if he's joking or not. Neither are we. \nMATHILDE Not necessary. \nJACK Noise? \nMATHILDE Silencer. \nJACK No such thing. You'll have to make do with a suppressor like everyone else. It'll dampen the decibels, dislocate the sound source and reduce muzzle flash. I can't make you silent but I can make you invisible as the Finnish phrase goes, but only as long as you're prepared to lose some range. \nJACK scans the crowd. \nOn the other side of the square he spots a YOUNG MAN in his mid-thirties with short blonde hair and slight sunburn, hovering by a stall. Average height, slim, athletic build; sunglasses, stone-washed designer jeans very neatly pressed with a sharp crease. \nJACK Two o'clock. \nMATHILDE Excuse me? \nJACK By the clothes stall. Light blue shirt, open at the neck, expensive buff suede shoes. Is he with you? \nThe YOUNG MAN has disappeared into the crowd. \nMATHILDE I didn't see him. In any case, I'm alone. \nA pause. \nJACK's jaw muscles grind. \nMATHILDE I can accept a slight loss of range. \nJACK You want a weapon with the firing capacity of a submachine gun and the range of a rifle. \nMATHILDE Can you do it? \nA beat. \nJACK Give me a month. To trial. Then a week for final adjustments. \n41   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, LANDSCAPE- TWILIGHT                    41 \nThe sun is sinking. \nIt's hunting hour. \nA FALCON hovers on the wind above the town, looking for prey. \n42   INT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, PENSIONE ABRUZZO- NIGHT                42 \nJACK is lying on top of his bed, fully clothed but fast asleep. \nHis eyes roll left and right beneath his lids. \nHe's dreaming. \nIn his right hand is a book of MEDIEVAL ITALIAN ART & ARCHITECTURE. \nTwitching in his sleep, JACK's grip on the ART & ARCHITECTURE BOOK slowly loosens... \nTHUD! \nAs the BOOK hits the floor JACK opens his eyes, sits up and rips the taped WALTHER from beneath the bed, pointing it at the door. \nSilence. \nJACK's heart is beating. \n43   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- MORNING                   43 \nJACK is looking through his BINOCULARS. \nJACK looks at the TOOLS hanging on the walls and littering the work benches. \nFABIO shrugs. \nFABIO (in ITALIAN) Help yourself. [In ENGLISH] My garage is your garage. \nJACK I appreciate that. \nFABIO gets on with work, sliding himself beneath the resprayed Alfa Romeo. \nJACK picks out various implements, laying them on the work surface: drill, hacksaw, lathe, vice, mallet. \nBehind an oil pan with a jagged hole in it he discovers several GEAR WHEELS with the teeth sheared off. He holds the biggest one up. \nJACK Bene? \nFABIO is engrossed his work. \nFABIO Si! Si! Va bene! \nJACK Quant'e? \nFABIO grins and growls. A gearwheel with no bite is useless to him. \nFABIO Niente! \nJACK wraps the gearwheel in a sheet of oily newspaper and puts it in the sports bag with the tools. \nAt the door, he pauses. \nThat's when JACK sees it on the notice board. A PHOTOGRAPH of FATHER BENEDETTO and FABIO. FABIO is much younger in this photo: fourteen or fifteen years old. He's wearing an AS Roma football strip. Again: the priest has his arm around the boy. \nJACK Ciao. Grazie. \nFABIO Ciao, Americano! \n57   INT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CHURCH- DAY                           57 \nFATHER BENEDETTO rings the CHURCH BELLS for Mass. \n58   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CHURCH TOWER- CONTINUOUS              58 \nTHREE CHURCH BELLS ringing: large, medium and small. \nAs the CLAPPERS hit the SOUNDBOWS we smash cut to: \n59   INT. JACK'S ROOM, PENSIONE ABRUZZO- CONTINUOUS               59 \nJACK has laid out his newly acquired tools on the flag stone floor of his room. \nBeside them is the SOCIMI SUB-MACHINE GUN. \nUsing the CHURCH BELLS as sound cover... \n...JACK puts the GEARWHEEL on a flag stone tile and smashes it into five pieces with a four pound MALLET. \n60   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO- NIGHT                                 60 \nBy torchlight, JACK is fashioning CONNECTORS from the smashed steel gear. \nIt's very, very tricky work and his eyes ache in the poor light. \n61   EXT. ITALIAN LANDSCAPE- DAY                                  61 \nJACK is wearing a knapsack. He's crossing a MEADOW and making his way towards a RUINED HAMLET. His manner is dark, purposeful, alert. \nThe grass is long and the trees offer deep shade. JACK stops. Everywhere there is a profusion of wild flowers. \nHis guardedness begins to evaporate. He has never seen anything so beautiful or utterly uncorrupted. He looks around, transfixed by delicate yellows and mauves, brash whites, harsh and brilliant crimsons, exquisite blues. The air is humming with insects, bees and butterflies. \nJACK is transfixed. \n62   EXT. RUINED HAMLET- DAY                                      62 \nJACK scrambles up towards the abandoned houses, sweating in the heat. \nHis original cautiousness has returned. Carefully, he checks the area for signs of recent disturbance. From the foot of the deserted hamlet he surveys the VALLEY with binoculars, monitoring every square on an imaginary grid for human activity. Satisfied that he's alone, he takes a deep breath of mountain air. \nAnd scrambles back down to the valley. \n63   EXT. WOODS- DAY                                              63 \nJACK has parked his CITROEN in the shade of a squat but ample WALNUT TREE. In the near distance is a LAKE. \nJACK crunches over half-formed walnuts until he reaches a patch of soft grass beside the water. \nThis, he decides, is the perfect spot. He unrolls a blanket, kneels, and from his KNAPSACK he produces: \n-a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a chilled bottle of Frascati \n-a loaf of course bread \n-50 gms of pecorino \n-100 gms of proscuitto \n-a small jar of black olives \n-an orange \n-and a rolled blanket containing the disassembled parts of the SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN. \nJACK sets the stopwatch on his weather beaten ROLEX. \nIt takes approximately thirty-four seconds to assemble the bastardised SOCIMI- including TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND SUPPRESSOR- and a further six seconds to press TEN ROUNDS into the magazine, slot it into the base of the hand grip, snuggle the butt to his shoulder and place his eye beside the rubber cup on the sight. \nHe's fast. \nCarefully he surveys the lake. Settles on a CLUMP OF REEDS. And with the focus and dexterity of a surgeon, concentrates until his grip and aim are perfectly tense and still. \nA beat... \nJACK takes his right hand from his pocket. \nHe's clutching the WALTHER. \nSlowly, he reaches his left hand upwards, towards the lintel above the door where he finds... \n...a single FEATHER. \n71   INT. JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT                                    71 \nFrom the inside of the room we watch four sturdily fashioned deadbolt locks slide open. Each lock is new and home made. \nJACK enters, shuts the door, locks all four bolts. And sits on the bed. \n72   EXT. ROADSIDE PAY PHONE- MORNING                           72 \nA cluster of houses by the side of a main road: a bar, a restaurant, a phone box. \nJACK puts a coin in the slot. Two rings. \nLARRY (V.O.) Jack? \nJACK I've got company. \nJACK scans the area outside. \nJACK If he's not baby-sitting the Belgian contract then he's either a Joe, a cop or a shooter. He's not with The Company, they're fast: it's been three days and no TA. He's not intel: they're deep background and he wants to be noticed. He might be a cowboy but he can't be a cop: they work in pairs and he's alone. Strike Guarda di Finanza, State Police and NOCS: he's not Italian- he doesn't look like one, dress like one or behave like one. So who the hell is he? \nA beat. \nJACK Larry? \nLARRY (V.O.) You got a long list of enemies, Jack. \nJACK What's he waiting for? \nJACK hears the sound of an engine. \nHis hand moves to his pocket. \nLARRY (V.O.) Jack? \nHe watches a black VW SHARON pass. There's a family inside. \nLARRY (V.O.) Want me to help take care of this? \nJACK I can handle it. \nLARRY (V.O.) You sound spooked. \nJACK It's a bad line. \nLARRY (V.O.) Jack? \nJACK Yes? \nLARRY (V.O.) I appreciate the value of a pre- emptive strike in circumstances like these, I really do, but if you're going to go Generation Kill then do me a favour, OK, because I'm running out of bribe money. [A BEAT] Make it look like an accident. \n73   EXT. TRAIN STATION- DAY                                    73 \nLittle more than a halt: one platform, one track, one station building- locked and shuttered. \nJACK steps out of his car. \nNo one around. \nHe checks his watch: it's exactly noon. \nA TRAIN approaches. \nIt's a three-carriage local. It rattles round the bend in the track up the valley, diesel fumes pluming. There are no more than a dozen passengers on board. \nMATHILDE is the only one to alight. \nHer once brown hair is now BLONDE. She's wearing a light summer skirt and carrying a navy blue canvas sports bag. \nThey shake hands as the train pulls away, belching and honking as it rattles over the girders of an iron bridge and crosses some alpine rapids. \nMATHILDE Mr. Clarke. How good to see you again. \nSomething quaint, old fashioned in her diction. English with the hint of a Belgian accent. \nJACK opens the boot of his car and she places her sports bag beside a WICKER PICNIC HAMPER. \nMATHILDE Refreshments? \nJACK The Carabinieri around here like roadblocks. It's cover. \nShe nods. \nThey get into the car. \nAs the JACK's door slams we smash cut to: \n74   INT. CAR- DAY                                                74 \nMATHILDE's sunglasses reflect the alpine landscape. \nMATHILDE You picked a beautiful spot. \nShe takes off her shades. \nHer once hazel eyes are now GREY-BLUE. \nShe glances round the hire car's drab plastic interior. \nMATHILDE You would be hard pressed to make a fast get away in this. \nPerhaps she's nervous. Her attempt at humour isn't working and she stumbles slightly on her grammar: \nMATHILDE I would have thought you to have had at least an Alfa Romeo. \nJACK Yes. \nSatisfied that he's alone, he lowers his binoculars. MATHILDE takes a deep breath of mountain air. \nMATHILDE It's beautiful here. \nShe is sitting on a loose stone wall at the edge of what was once a terraced field. Her dress dips between her legs as she leans forward and rests her forearms on her knees, tired from the journey and the long, hot climb. \nMATHILDE I wish everywhere could be this tranquil. \nJACK looks at her, sensing a kindred spirit. \nJACK You'd be out of a job. \nMATHILDE You don't like the peace? \nJACK It's hard to like something you know nothing about. \n79   EXT. WOODS- DAY                                            79 \nThe WICKER PICNIC HAMPER is sitting on a rug by between the parked car and the lake. From the hamper, JACK removes: \n-a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a chilled bottle of Aspirinio \n-a loaf of course bread \n-two clods of mozarella \n-150 gms of proscuitto \n-100 gms of parma ham \n-a large jar of pitted green olives \n-a Thermos of sweet black coffee \n-and, wrapped in cloth squares, the disassembled parts of the improved SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN. \nAs MATHILDE starts to assemble the weapon with easy skill, JACK checks the stopwatch on his ROLEX. \nIt takes her approximately twenty-eight seconds to assemble the bastardised gun- including TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND SUPPRESSOR- and a further three seconds to slot the empty magazine into the base of the hand grip, snuggle the butt to her shoulder and place her eye beside the rubber cup on the sight. \nShe's almost ten seconds faster than JACK. \nHe stares at her: not an alluring young woman with good legs and nice tits but an extension of the weapon itself and everything it means. \nMATHILDE Rounds? \nJACK I've made up two sorts. \nHe reaches into the PICNIC HAMPER. \nJACK Thirty lead and thirty jacketed. \nMATHILDE I should like a hundred of each. \nIt's an order: her voice is emotionless. \nMATHILDE And fifty explosive. \nJACK Not a problem. \nHe hands her the practise ammunition in two small cartridge boxes: the shells snug in little plastic trays. \nJACK Will mercury do? \nShe smiles almost imperceptibly. \nMATHILDE Mercury will do very nicely. \nShe puts the gun down butt-first, leaning it against the side of the car. \nMATHILDE I have made my own targets. \nShe reaches into her BLUE CANVAS SPORTS BAG and removes several pieces of folded cardboard strengthened with split bamboo cane. \nWithout speaking she sets off through the alpine blooms. In her wake flutter a confetti of butterflies and grass crickets, honey bees sizzling frantically as her loose summer skirt sweeps across the flowers. \nJACK Watch out for vipers. \nHe keeps his voice down but she hears him nonetheless, waving with her right hand: the hand holding the AMMUNITION BOXES. She's no fool. \nNeither is he. He has the gun. \nAt ninety meters distance she stops beside a pile of smooth stones- a boundary cairn- overgrown with little purple trumpet blooms. \nShe unfolds the cardboard. At this distance all we can make out is a silver-grey shape against the stones. \nReturning to the car she picks up the weapon. \nMATHILDE Muzzle velocity? \nJACK At least three hundred and sixty miles per hour. That's including twenty off the top for the sound suppression. \nImpressed, MATHILDE looks at the marks on the metal where the serial number has been removed with acid. \nMATHILDE Socimi? \nJACK Eight-two-one. \nMATHILDE I've not had one before. \nJACK You'll find it easy. I've re- balanced it for the longer barrel. The fulcrum is two centimetres forward of the grip now. Which won't matter if you're firing- and I'm guessing you are- from a fixed position. \nNo answer. \nJACK No major recoil issues. You should be able to hold onto any target. Even the smallest. \nMATHILDE puts two jacketed rounds into the magazine and stands with her feet apart, braced. The breeze beneath the walnut tree ruffles her summer skirt and presses it against her legs. \nCHOOP! CHOOP! \nJACK It wouldn't look right if the picnic wasn't touched. \nMATHILDE You chilled the wine. I thought... \nJACK It had to be chilled. They're Italian cops. \nMATHILDE (disappointed) You think of everything. \nJACK I'm paid to. Don't move. \nShe freezes. \nJACK points slowly. \nOn her tanned forearm is a BUTTERFLY. \nMATHILDE Wow. \nThey both stare at the insect, transfixed. \nMATHILDE It's so beautiful. \nJACK Parnassius apollo. It's endangered. \nShe looks up at him. Like it's a revelation she says: \nMATHILDE You like coming here. \nJACK It serves its purpose. \nMATHILDE You've never taken a woman here before? \nJACK is momentarily taken aback. \nJACK No. \nThe BUTTERFLY flits away. \nMATHILDE (sadly) Perhaps you do not have a woman in your life. It is not easy for us to keep relationships. Not in our world. \nJACK I have an acquaintance. \nA beat. \nShe waits for him to say more. \nHe doesn't. \nMATHILDE Friendships are transitory. It is... \nSuddenly, there's movement in the bushes. \nJACK snatches up his BINOCULARS. MATHILDE scans the tree cover. \nJACK Wild boar. \nHe hands her the binoculars. And hurriedly packs up the picnic. \n80   INT. CAR- DAY                                              80 \nHer sunglasses back on, MATHILDE watches the meadows slip backwards in the nearside wing mirror as the car bumps back down the alpine track. \nMATHILDE I wish you hadn't brought me here. \nAgain... a real sadness. \nJACK glances at her. \nMATHILDE This is the sort of place I wish I'd discovered by myself. Then maybe one day I could have retired here. But you already know it. \nJACK is touched. \nJACK I'm much older than you. By the time you've retired I'll be dead. \n81   EXT. RURAL TRAIN STATION- DAY                                81 \nThe CITROEN pulls up. \n82   INT. CITROEN- DAY                                            82 \nThe YOUNG WOMAN's manner is once more tense and formal. \nMATHILDE We will meet as before? \nJACK nods. \nThe distant sound of a DIESEL ENGINE. The train is approaching. \nMATHILDE On the first of next month? \nHe nods again. \nMATHILDE Around noon? \nNot even a nod this time: just a slow blink. \nMATHILDE opens the door, runs around to the boot and grabs her canvas sports bag. Then returns to the passenger side of the car and looks in. \nMATHILDE Thank you for a lovely day. Mr. Butterfly. \nShe leans in.. \n...and kisses him lightly on the cheek, her lips light and quick on his stubble. \nMATHILDE You must take your mistress to the meadow for a picnic. \nShe closes the car door, walks onto the platform and vanishes onto a waiting carriage. The TRAIN honks and belches, moving off down the track in the direction from which it came. \nJACK watches it go. \nAnd drives off. \nThe bed is empty, the sheets twisted and damp. \n87   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE- DAWN                                   87 \nSUNRISE... \n...over one of the most desolate and beautiful landscapes in all Italy. \n88   INT. JACK'S ROOM- DAWN                                        88 \nIn the gun-metal light of dawn, fiddly work: \n-cartridges taken apart \n-tiny holes drilled in the nose to a depth of precisely 3mm \n-the hole half-filled with mercury \n-and plugged with a drop of liquid lead. \nJACK is converting jacketed ammunition into EXPLOSIVE BULLETS. \n89   INT. CHURCH- DAY                                              89 \nOutside, the sun is merciless. Inside, JACK has taken refuge in the cool of the church. He is alone. He is not praying. Just staring impassively at the gaudy crucifixion: at the thorns and the nails and the running blood. \nFootsteps. JACK checks for reflections in his watch. \nIt's FATHER BENEDETTO: dressed for Mass. \nFATHER BENEDETTO I've been looking for you. \nHe mops the sweat from his brow with the hem of his Soutane, takes JACK by the arm and leads him to one side, away from the light of the candles. \nFATHER BENEDETTO A man was here asking questions about you. \nA beat. \nJACK Here? \nFATHER BENEDETTO He came to the church this afternoon. \nJACK What did he want? \nFATHER BENEDETTO To know where you live. He said he was a friend from Switzerland. \nJACK Switzerland? \nJACK thinks. \nJACK And you told him? \nThe priest looks at with complete disdain: \nFATHER BENEDETTO Of course I do not tell him. How do I know him? He is maybe the police. Certainly he is no friend. A friend would know your pensione. Besides... \nFATHER BENEDETTO leans close and whispers: \nFATHER BENEDETTO Friends do not carry guns. \nFATHER BENEDETTO glances shrewdly at JACK, his eyes searching into him. \nFATHER BENEDETTO If you live in Italy, and you are a man of the cloth, you meet many people. Besides, I lived once in Naples. If you live in Naples you know the difference between a fat wallet and a... custodia per armi di spalla. How you say in English? \nJACK Shoulder holster. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Si. \nJACK glances up and down the aisle. \nOLD LADIES are dribbling into church in twos and threes. \nThe BELL for mass starts ringing. \nJACK You're a true friend, father. \nFATHER BENEDETTO I am a priest. \nJACK turns to go. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Signor Clarke? \nAgain the priest leans close, holding JACK by the elbow in a gesture of austere confidence. \nFATHER BENEDETTO I make a mistake. He did not say he was from La Svizzera: Switzerland. He said- forgive me the names in Italian are so similar- La Svezia: Sweden. \n90   EXT. CHURCH, ROOF- DAY                                      90 \nTHREE BELLS are ringing in the tower. Beneath them, a row of mediaeval GARGOYLES (dragons, griffins, dogs and devils) look down over the little town, their faces frightening or frightened. \nJACK is among the gargoyles, leaning over parapet, his eyes made huge by a pair of tiny binoculars, surveying the town below, checking each square of the grid for a glimpse of the YOUNG MAN. \nNothing. Then he notices: \nParked in the shadow of a spreading chestnut tree not far from the main square. An AUDI... \n...with the YOUNG MAN we spotted in Castelveccio market sitting at the wheel. \n91   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, STREET- NIGHT                        91 \nThe YOUNG MAN comes out of a shop. \nThis is the first time we've seen him up close. In his early thirties, he's wearing a dark brown leather jacket and expensive jeans. His blonde hair is cropped short, and there's the hint of a botched prison-cell tattoo visible just beneath the collar of his shirt. \nThe YOUNG MAN opens a small silver tin and a single deft movement removes a portion of SNUS (Swedish chewing tobacco) and inserts the it between his top lip and gum. \nIt is a strangely sinister act. \nThen he blends in with the tourists, milling down the Corso and round the square heading towards... \n92   INT. BAR- NIGHT                                              92 \nThe YOUNG MAN looks his way. \nJACK is outlined by the moped's beam of light. \nThe two men are face to face, within spitting distance. \nThe DUCATI hurtles towards the YOUNG MAN. \nThe MAN ON THE DUCATI is wearing a tinted BLACK CRASH HELMET. \nThe YOUNG MAN's eyes widen with fear. \nBANG! \nThe DUCATI misfires. \nMistaking the sound for gunfire, the YOUNG MAN drops, rolls and fires back. \nWe hear the sound of a single suppressed shot: CHOOP! \nThe BULLET grazes the FRONT SUSPENSION of the DUCATI and lodges in the REAR COWLING. \nThe MAN ON THE DUCATI swerves and crashes, hitting a stone staircase. \nJACK looks around. \nThe YOUNG MAN has disappeared. \nThe MAN ON THE DUCATI is out cold. \nThe front wheel of his DUCATI turns slowly, squeaking. \nCHOOP! \nA bullet hits the road not far from JACK. \nCHOOP! \nAnother bullet hits the wall behind him. \nSwiftly, JACK grabs hold of the battered 1970s DUCATI... \n98    EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE,    MEDIAVEVAL MAZE- NIGHT             98 \nJACK rides the classic DUCATI, turning left and right without hesitation, through archways, down steps, dropping level by level, cursing in time with his jagged breathing until... \n99    EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN- NIGHT              99 \nJACK emerges from the bottom of the town and races away on the winding road. \nSilence. All we can hear are the crickets. \nThen the sound of a car. \nAn AUDI tears past us, following JACK out of town. \n100   EXT. ALPINE ROAD- NIGHT                                    100 \nJACK is heading for the mountains. He takes the first corner at 70 MPH. \nThe AUDI gleams black in the moonlight. Gaining on him. \n101   EXT. ANOTHER ANGLE- NIGHT                                  101 \nJACK takes the next bend at top speed, his classic 1970 1000cc engine howling. \nThe AUDI slows, then powers through the bend, accelerating. \n102   INT. AUDI- NIGHT                                            102 \nThe YOUNG MAN puts his foot down. \nThe SPEEDOMETER climbs. \n103   EXT. ALPINE ROAD- NIGHT                                     103 \nThe AUDI comes up swiftly behind Jack's DUCATI and tries to ram him. \nJACK dodges the AUDI, swerving from one side of the road to another. \n104   EXT. VIADUCT- NIGHT                                         104 \nA soaring concrete bridge spans a plunging alpine valley. \nThe AUDI overtakes the DUCATI, then swerves left, trying to crush JACK against the concrete barrier that masks a three hundred and fifty foot fall. \nJACK breaks hard and the AUDI misses him, smashing into the concrete barrier amidst a shower of sparks and screeching metal. \nThe AUDI follows the DUCATI into... \n105   EXT. ALPINE TUNNEL- NIGHT                                   105 \nLong, dark, neon-lit... and blind curved. \nThe AUDI comes up fast behind the DUCATI. \nJack swerves the DUCATI onto the other side of the road. \nThe AUDI swerves left and tries to crush JACK into the left- hand wall of the tunnel. \nSuddenly, a CAR comes round the bend. \nWhat happens next happens fast: \nJACK swerves left and skids into a SERVICE LAY-BY, narrowly avoiding the CAR. \nThe lay-by is small and JACK has to slide the DUCATI on it's side as he crashes it into the box-like space. \nThe lay-by is too small for the AUDI. \nThe AUDI and oncoming CAR collide. \nJACK What makes you think I'm leaving? \nFATHER BENEDETTO You told me as much when we first met. Besides, those who seek for peace seldom find it. They're always moving on, looking elsewhere. [A BEAT] And they are usually sinners. \nJACK All men are sinners. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Some are greater sinners than others. And those who seek peace have much sinning in their history. \nJACK I don't seek peace. I never have. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Until now. \nJACK Perhaps. Perhaps I'll stay. The valley. The villages. The mountains. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Forgive me. This is the priest in me speaking. And the friend. But you have done much sinning, Signor Clarke. You still do. \nJACK I see a whore. She's young enough to be my daughter. \nFATHER BENEDETTO I do not refer to the sins of carnality. But to the deadly sins... \nJACK Aren't all sins equal? \nFATHER BENEDETTO We are not discussing theology, my friend, but you. You like this town, this valley. (MORE) \nFATHER BENEDETTO (cont'd) You should like to remain here and find your peace at last. Yet you cannot. There is something you cannot ignore. Some force. Some enemy. \nJACK is silent. \nFATHER BENEDETTO You want to speak but you dare not. You know no one sufficiently well to share your history with them. You know I am trustworthy yet still you are cautious. \nFATHER BENEDETTO stops, compelling JACK to stop too- and face him. \nFATHER BENEDETTO What job do you do, Signor? Are you on the run, as they say? \nJACK Who says? \nFATHER BENEDETTO It's an expression, no? \nJACK Everyone's on the run from something. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Some men watch some of the shadows. You watch them all. \nJACK I've done nothing I didn't have good cause to do. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Do you wish to tell me? \nJACK For what reason? \nFATHER BENEDETTO For your own sake. Perhaps I can pray for you? \nA change of pace. \nJACK I make things. Artifacts. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Counterfeit money? \nJACK Why do you say that? \nFATHER BENEDETTO You work in metal. You are given some steel by Fabio, the car doctor. \nJACK You know a lot about me. \nFATHER BENEDETTO I know only what you do in the town. People talk to me. I am their priest and they trust me. \nJACK And I should too? \nFATHER BENEDETTO Of course. \nThey stare at one another. \nJACK wants to confess. He does not know why. \nBut he doesn't. He does something we're not expecting: \nJACK Fabio. The `car doctor'. Was he conceived here father? \nFATHER BENEDETTO is motionless. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Why do you ask me that? \nJACK He looks like you. Even more than he does in the photos you keep of each other. Where was he conceived, father? Under one of these trees? At night? Like all the other bastards? \nThere is a very, very long pause. FATHER BENEDETTO stares up at JACK with extraordinary intensity. \nFATHER BENEDETTO I do not remember, Signor. It was twenty-five years ago. \nFATHER BENEDETTO walks. JACK follows. A gust of wind makes dust swirl from the gravel path. The two men do not speak again until they reach the next set of Cyprus trees. \nFATHER BENEDETTO In the end it is I who confesses to you. \nJACK Expecting me to reciprocate? \nFATHER BENEDETTO Perhaps. For your own good. You cannot doubt the existence of Hell. You live in it. It is a place without love. As for me, I go about my daily duties because the town requires it of me. Some know what you know. Perhaps I have no right to wear these robes. But I do have a heart full of a father's love. Something close to His heart! And for that I am both grateful and happy. \nOn JACK. \nFATHER BENEDETTO What do you have, my friend? \nAnother gust of wind. The priest looks up into JACK's face. \nThe assassin's eyes are red and stinging. Perhaps its from the dust. \n118   INT. JACK'S ROOM- EVENING                                  118 \nJACK dresses very carefully for dinner. \nIt is clear he wishes to make a favourable impression upon CLARA. \n119   EXT. LOCANDA GRAPELLI- NIGHT                               119 \nStone steps lead up from the street to large paved veranda that overlooks the town. Overhead a canopy of vine and jasmine. Above that a sky full of stars. \nThey are saved by the appearance of the WAITER. \nWAITER Buona sera. Desidera? \nCLARA orders, full of Italian charm, putting JACK at his ease. He watches her contentedly: the way she talks and moves. \n121   EXT. CORSO FREDERICO- NIGHT                                  121 \nJACK   and CLARA are walking. He has a cigarette in his mouth. They   look like film stars. CLARA slips her arm through his. They   say nothing. The pedestrian shopping street is thronging with   other couples. \n122   EXT. COFFEE BAR- NIGHT                                       122 \nThe coffee bar has an outside section. CLARA and L'AMERICANO are seated in a throng of happy youngsters Clara's age. JACK is the oldest person there. \nThe WAITRESS brings two glasses of PROSECCO. She puts a small silver bowl of raspberry ice cream down in front of JACK. In front of CLARA she puts down an extravagant ice cream sundae. CLARA grins at her sundae like a little girl. She's a bit drunk. \nCLARA Woooow! \nShe eats, savoring the ice cream. JACK watches, savoring her pleasure. \nJACK How is it? \nCLARA Bitchin'. \nJACK (amused) Bitchin'? \nCLARA It's- come se dice- `slang', no? Eco. \nShe scoops a spoonful dripping with nuts and chocolate sauce and holds it out to JACK. \nJACK No thanks. \nCLARA Come on, Eduardo! \nHe hesitates. He eats. \nCLARA It is good, you will agree? \nJACK (his mouth full) I will agree. \nCLARA (sensing his teasing) My English is nice! \nJACK It's bitchin'. \nCLARA (defending herself) You know how to swear in Italian? \nJACK Sure. Bastardo. Imbecile. \nCLARA \"Imbecile?\" Eduardo! Try: Mangia merde e morte: tuo cazzo un brufolo. \nJACK Eat shit and die, pimple dick? \nCLARA hiccups. \nCLARA Perdone! \nJACK I guess I've led a sheltered life. Of sorts. \nCLARA Shell-tered? \nJACK Too much work. \nCLARA's CELL PHONE starts to ring. It's on silent, but the screen is flashing, just visible where it sticks out of her handbag. CLARA looks down at the phone. \nCLARA Too much work. \nShe turns the phone to silent. And looks up at JACK. \nCLARA I don't apologise, Eduardo. \nJACK For what? \nCLARA For this I do. My job. \nJACK Never apologise. \nHe means it. \nA beat. \nCLARA Except this job is full of testa di cazzo. \nJACK Mine too. \nCLARA Lei? \nJACK Si. \nCLARA But you are too young to... pensione? \nJACK Retire. \nCLARA Si. \nJACK Liar. \nCLARA No! \nJACK Would you be flattering me if I wasn't a client? \nHe's put CLARA on the spot. \nJACK Am I a client? \nCLARA takes a deep breath. \nCLARA This say yes. \nShe points at her head. \nCLARA This... \nLARRY (V.O.) I told `em if we couldn't trust you to keep a tight lid on operations the who could we trust? \nJACK They can. They can trust me and so can you. \nJACK is tense. Every word is carefully enunciated: \nJACK I've never jeopardised an operation in my life. \nLARRY (V.O.) You don't have to tell me that, Jack. For Christ's sake, you closed your own girlfriend's account... \nECU on JACK. \n127   INT. LARRY'S APARTMENT, ROME- DAY                            127 \nThe words are out before he can stop them. \nLARRY Jack? [A BEAT] Jack? I'm sorry. \nHe rubs his eyes, wearied by his own insensitivity. \nLARRY That was, um.... I'm just saying you can be relied on. \nSilence. \nLARRY Jack? \nCLICK. \n128   EXT. PAY PHONE- DAY                                          128 \nJACK has hung up. \nHe is lost in fearful thought, jaw muscles grinding. \n129   EXT. CHURCH, ROOF- NIGHT                                     129 \nAmongst the GARGOYLES... \n...JACK, looking through his miniature binoculars. \nHis POV: \nOf CLARA seated in a cafe talking to a slick, tough YOUNG ITALIAN MAN in a suit. \nHe is showing her photographs. Of what- we cannot see. CLARA looks very, very serious. \nThe YOUNG ITALIAN MAN leaves. JACK watches him get into a smart black ALFA ROMEO containing two other ITALIAN MEN. Rome plates. \nWhen he looks back at the cafe, CLARA has gone. \n130   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- DAY                     130 \nJACK opens his PICNIC HAMPER and in it he puts: \n-a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a chilled bottle of Aspirinio \n-a loaf of course bread \n-two clods of mozarella \n-150 gms of proscuitto \n-and his WALTHER PPK/S. \n131   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE- DAY                                  131 \nCLARA is waiting on the Via Strinella near the entrance to the Parco della Resistanza, sheltering in the shade of a tree. \nShe is holding the RED PURSE. At her feet is blue plastic bag rounded out by a watermelon. \nJACK pulls his CAR into the curb. \nCLARA Ciao, Eduardo! \nShe opens the passenger door, leans in and kisses JACK long and full on the lips. \nJACK Put them in the back. We've got a way to go. \nShe puts the plastic bag in the trunk. \nInside the trunk is the PICNIC HAMPER. \n132   INT. CAR-   DAY                                             132 \nCLARA climbs in and fastens her seat-belt. \nShe puts the RED PURSE between her legs. JACK glances at the RED PURSE. \nAnd drives. \nCLARA Where we go? \nJACK Swimming. \nCLARA How far do we go? To Fanale? \nJACK An hour. And we're not going to the sea, we're going to the lakes. In the mountains. \nCLARA For a... come se dice... you have in the back... \nJACK A picnic. \nCLARA A pick-nick! We are going for a pick-nick. Just the two of us. \nShe looks at him. \nCLARA I have practise my English, Eduardo. I love to have pick-nick. It is a beautiful day, isn't it? \nJACK It is. \n133   EXT. ALPINE ROAD- DAY                                      133 \nShe speaks so quietly JACK can barely hear her. \nJACK No. \nCLARA Just you. \nJACK Yes. \nCLARA turns away, unbuttons her blouse and drops it on the grass. She is wearing no bra. On her back dapple the shadows and patches of sun eking through the branches of the walnut. She kicks off her shoes, which curve through the air... and unzips her skirt. It falls to the grass. She bends and steps daintily from her knickers. Then turns to face JACK. \nJACK cannot take his eyes off her. Dizzy, he steps forward without meaning to. \nCLARA Well? \nShe is coquettish- and tosses her auburn hair to one side. \nCLARA I am going to swim in the lake. Are you coming? \nShe doesn't wait for his reply, but turns and runs through the grass towards the water. \nJACK There are vipers! Vipera! Marasso! \nCLARA Maybe! But I am lucky! \nThe HERON flies off, rising from the reeds with an ungainly flapping. \nCLARA (shouting) He is an Italian bird! We disturb his siesta! \nQuickly, JACK glances inside the CITROEN. \nThe RED PURSE is nowhere to be seen. \nCLARA Come, Signor Farfalla! \nJACK undresses. As he removes his clothes, he stalls for time, using the cover of undressing to search for the RED PURSE. \nWe can see it wedged under the passenger seat. \nDue to the design of the car, JACK cannot. \nCLARA Come! \nJACK turns to face the lake. He is naked. Yet with the caution of years he does not remove his shoes until he reaches the water's edge. \nCLARA is standing in the middle. \nCLARA Stand by me. \nHe obeys her order. He walks out to her and she takes his hand under the water, holding it out in front of them. \nJACK spots it resting on the smooth stone of the lake-bed. Brassy and gleaming. A SPENT SHELL. He covers it with his foot. \nCLARA Keep still. Watch. \nAs the ripples of his arrival peter out in the reeds, TINY FISH appear in a shoal to gather about their hands. They hover like slivers of glass just under the surface then move in to nibble at the skin on their fingers. \nJACK If we stay here for a year, they'll devour us. \nCLARA It is said that if these fishes bite at two hands holding, then love is good for the people. \nHe looks at her and for a moment he forgets the awful plan in his head. \nShe kisses him, pressing herself against him, her skin and body as pure and warm as the water. \nHe tries helplessly to pull away. \nJACK Maybe we should... \nCLARA Do you make love in the water? \nJACK I haven't. \nShe places her arms around his neck and raises her feet from the smooth stones, wrapping her legs around his waist. She tries to push herself onto him but he resists. \nCLARA What's wrong? \nHe doesn't know what to say. She looks at him: confused, searching. \nJACK Let's eat. \nHe walks towards the bank. She follows. The tiny fish dart around them for a few moments then flee for the reeds, travelling with the waves made by their departure. \n137   EXT. LAKESIDE- DAY                                         137 \nCLARA is lying naked on a blanket. \nBeside her is the RED PURSE. \nThrough sleepy, half-closed eyes she is watching L'AMERICANO. \nFrom her POV, JACK is kneeling behind the open PICNIC HAMPER, unpacking the food and wine. The LID of the basket obscures his hands. \nCLARA Eduardo. \nJACK looks at her. \nCLARA Is this your real name? \nA beat. \nJACK Is Clara yours? \nCLARA Si. Yes. \nShe looks at him. Waiting for his reply. \nJACK Edward is my real name. \nCLARA Ed-ward. \nShe doesn't believe him. \nCLARA Non capito... how one person hurt another in this way. \nJACK looks lost, like a man drained of all resolution. \nJACK Does the gun make you feel safer with me? \nCLARA You are not a client. \nJACK Then why's it in your purse? \nCLARA looks unhappy. \nCLARA I have to work tonight, amore. \nSilence. \nJACK looks away. \nJACK (V.O.) Maybe this is suicide. Cops often put the graft on working girls. Perhaps the girl I told you about, Clara, has sold me out. (MORE) \nJACK (V.O.) (cont'd) Maybe she's a cop herself, or maybe she's a hired gun. Then again, maybe Clara is who she says she is and my Belgian clients will take the gun, shoot me themselves and keep the money. Always a risk in my profession. Or perhaps my trusted colleague in Rome no longer trusts me. Perhaps even you, Father, with your connections in Naples... \nCLARA What will you do? \nJACK I guess I'll go to work too. \nCLARA And after that? Tomorrow and the next day. \nJACK I can't stay here forever. \nAs the words leave his lips he thinks how much he wishes he could. \nJACK (V.O.) It's not that I've given up on life, Father. Just the way that I was living it. If you can call it living. \nCLARA I want always to stay here. \nJACK It's time to go home. \nCLARA Let me come to your home. \nJACK I can't, Clara. One day... \nShe's upset but decides not to press her demand. \nJACK (V.O.) If I had one request, Father, it would be this. That it's not Clara who finally pulls the trigger. But whoever it is... \nCLARA kisses him and simply says: \nCLARA Stay forever here. \nJACK (V.O.) ...by this time tomorrow I'll be dead. \nFade to black. \nFADE IN: \n139   EXT/INT. CHURCH- DAY                                        139 \nA POSTMAN hands the mail to FATHER BENEDETTO. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Ciao Fabio, come stai? \nIL POSTINO Bene grazie, Padre. \nWe follow FATHER BENEDETTO inside as he rifles through a bunch of church circulars. One LETTER catches his eye. \nHe opens it and starts to read aloud: \nFATHER BENEDETTO Dear Father Benedetto. I promised myself that I would write to you- as your friend- to say goodbye... \n140   INT. JACK'S ROOM- DAWN                                      140 \nJACK stands by the door in a impeccably pressed suit, the black SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE in his hand. \nHe surveys his room. All evidence of his existence has been meticulously tidied away. \nFATHER BENEDETTO (V.O.) Everything I've ever done... \nJACK leaves. \nOnly thing is left behind: \nThe book of MEDIEVAL ITALIAN ART & ARCHITECTURE on the bedside table. \nFATHER BENEDETTO (V.O.) I've done for a reason. \n141   EXT. AUTOSTRADA- DAY                                        141 \nThe sun is shining. The mountains young and sharp and beautiful. The CAR moves swiftly across the viaduct that spans a spectacular gorge and plunges into a long tunnel. \n142   INT. CAR- CONTINUOUS                                        142 \nJACK watches the road. On the long straights he looks backwards and forwards. \n143   EXT. SERVICE STATION- DAY                                   143 \nJACK comes off the autostrada on a slip road and pulls into a forecourt consisting of several rows of Agip and Q8 pumps, a convenience shop, a repair garage and a cafe. \nThe car park is not large. JACK parks the Citroen facing the EXIT. There is a single bar across it but this is raised. \nJACK double checks the magazine in his handgun is full and slips his WALTHER into his jacket pocket. \nStepping out of the car he looks around the car park. It's only a quarter full and ominously quiet. Somewhere in the distance we can hear a sound: creak, creak, creak, creak... \nJACK takes the BRIEFCASE from the rear seat and walks away. He makes a show of locking the car but doesn't. \nAs he approaches the CAFE he passes the GARAGE. We see the source of the creak, creak, creaking sound: a SIGN for engine oil, on hinges, revolving slowly in the breeze. \n144   INT. AUTOSTRADA CAFE- DAY                                   144 \nEmpty. \nMATHILDE Buy yourself a retirement clock. \nHer American accent shows that she's letting her guard down. Maybe it's designed to make JACK do the same. \nIt doesn't. \nJACK How do you know I'm retiring? \nShe leans forward and kisses him lightly and quickly and on the lips. \nMATHILDE Have you taken your girl up to the meadow yet? \nJACK doesn't answer. His whole body is tense for the bullet that he knows his coming. Perhaps there is a second person in the car. \nJust then... \n...a COACH pulls into the car park. \nIt stops with a hydraulic hiss and dozens of TEENAGE KIDS descend. \nMATHILDE looks both irritated and relieved. \nMATHILDE (whispers to JACK) Do it. \nShe gets into the driver's seat of the FORD and swings the BRIEFCASE into the back. \nMATHILDE Goodbye, Mr. Butterfly. \nJACK tenses as MATHILDE raises her hand in farewell. \nThe FORD pulls away and disappears down the slip road onto the autostrada. \nJACK watches it go. \nThumbs back the lever on his Walther. \nGets into his Citroen. \nAnd opens the ENVELOPE. \n-No wires. \n-No tricks. \n-Just a HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS. \nJACK stares at the money. He isn't supposed to be alive. For a while he stays put. He shuts his eyes in the sunshine and listens to the laughter of the teenage kids. To a girl calling: \"Amore!\" To the cicadas. To the distant rush of traffic on the autostrada. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n148   EXT. AUTOSTRADA- DAY                                          148 \nJACK drives fast... \n...turning off the highway beneath a sign for L'AQUILA. \n149   EXT. L'AQUILA- DAY                                            149 \nAt the end a small street, JACK parks his car like a true Italian: illegally. \nRuns towards CLARA'S APARTMENT. \nAnd rings the buzzer. \nNo answer. \nJACK rings again. \nStill nothing. \nShouts up at her window: \nJACK CLARA! \n150   EXT. AUTOSTRADA, CAFE- DAY                                  150 \nWe're at another roadside service station. \nLARRY comes out of a Kentucky Fried Chicken. \nHe climbs into the passenger seat of the FORD. \nMATHILDE drives off. \n151   INT. FORD- DAY                                              151 \nLARRY is dusting bread crumbs off his shirt. \nHe's about to get his hands dirty and he doesn't like it. \nLARRY Not only did you not kill him, you gave him my fucking money? \nMATHILDE What else could I do? There were kids everywhere. Besides he's suspicious. \nLARRY He's paranoid. That's why I'm paying you the GDP of a small country to get close to him. You could have got him in the sack. You should have got him in the car park. Now you're going to have to take him out long range! \nMATHILDE I prefer it that way. \nShe is a trained assassin. She respects JACK. \nMATHILDE The Socimi is the perfect weapon. \nLARRY Let's hope his workmanship is up to scratch. \nHe slams a full magazine into the butt of a STERLING SUBMACHINE GUN. \nLARRY Sweden turned Jack into a liability. Three stiffs: two shooters and an innocent civilian. I can't afford a mistake like that again. Europol are crooked but they aren't cheap. Jack's supposed to make me money. Not run up cleaning bills. \nMATHILDE He made short work of the last guy you hired. \nLARRY Never mind Larson. He didn't stand a chance, not against someone as paranoid as Jack. The Swede was only there to take Jack's heat off you. So don't fuck this up again. \nCLARA To live? \nJACK Where else? \nCLARA Forever? \nJACK Forever. \nA pause. \nJACK Unless you have other plans. \nCLARA Other plans? \nShe swears in Italian. Obscenities. Then throws herself around JACK and squeezes him with all her strength. There are tears in her eyes. \nCLARA I love you, Signor Eduardo Farfalla. \nHe looks at her. \nJACK I... \n162   INSERT:                                                    162 \nThe TRIGGER FINGER squeezes. \nThe SOCIMI SUBMACHINE fires. \nAn EXPLOSIVE BULLET travels down the chamber at approximately 360 miles per hour headed straight for JACK's temporal lobe. \nOnly it never gets there. \nThe gun jams. \nA chamber explosion is a nasty thing. Instead of shooting out of the barrel, the round explodes in the cannon's chamber. \nHot shrapnel fragments like a land mine, ripping into MATHILDE's hands, forearms and face... \n163   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- DAY                    163 \nA loud BANG pulls JACK and CLARA apart. Amidst the noise of the festival, no one else seems to notice. \nJACK looks in the direction of the HOTEL ROOF. \nCLARA What's happening? \nJACK Someone got what was coming to them. \nHe turns to her: \nJACK Go to your apartment and pack. Wait `till I get there. Don't answer the door to anyone but me. \nCLARA Eduardo, please? \nJACK Trust me. \nShe looks at him. \nCLARA I trust you. \nShe wants to, but she doesn't. \nJACK Clara. My name is not Eduardo. \nCLARA No? \nJACK My name is Jack. \nCLARA Jack. \nShe looks worried. \nCLARA You promise you're not married? \nJACK I promise. Take this. \nHe hands her an ENVELOPE. It contains his final instalment. \nJACK Look after it. In case. \nCLARA (perplexed) In case? \nHe wants to say it but he can't bring himself to. \nIn case this is goodbye. \nJACK Now go. \n164   EXT. STREET- DAY                                            164 \nLARRY is waiting on the corner of the town square. \nHe is dialling and re-dialling a number in his mobile phone, scanning the crowds around him. \nIn the two seconds it takes the TAXI to pass by, JACK steps free of a row cars on the other side of the street. \nAs LARRY comes into view again, JACK sees the STERLING SUBMACHINE GUN in his hands. \nAnd LARRY sees JACK. \nLARRY'S FINGER tightens on the trigger. \nL'AMERICANO throws himself to one side. \nThere is a quick burst of popping explosions: ripping along the line of parked cars. \nPANIC erupts. \nJACK is about to fire back at LARRY but LARRY takes cover behind a TOURIST and fires back another brief burst. \nJACK is hit in the shoulder. He drops his gun... \n", "test1_input": "22   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- DAY                      22 \nA toothbrush in the glass by the sink. \nThe guidebook on the bedside table. \nApart for this, JACK has avoided unpacking: living entirely out of his holdall for some time. \nFrom the holdall, JACK produces a pair of Leica 15x56 Geovid BRF Rangefinding BINOCULARS. \nThrough his casement window he has good view of CASTELVECCHIO. \nHe sweeps the town in grid formation: calm and methodical. This is a routine assessment. \nJACK's POV: apart from the occasional appearance of an old man, woman or dog, the dead town across the valley is empty. \n23   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT                    23 \nJACK is lying on top of his bed, fully clothed and wide awake. \nTaped to the inside of the wooden bed frame... \n...is his WALTHER semi-automatic handgun. \n24   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, OLD TOWN CENTRE- DAY                  24 \nBlinding SUN fills frame. \nJACK is ostensibly photographing the sights: the mediaeval architecture, the square, the church. \n25   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CHURCH- DAY                           25 \nThe CHURCH is at the top of town. A PRIEST, dressed in black, surveys the world below him: \nLocals are going about their business, a few scattered tourists are enjoying their holiday. One `tourist' catches the PRIEST's attention. \nPerhaps it's his build. Or the fact that he's the only tourist on his own. Or perhaps it's the obsessive grid-like methodology with which JACK photographs the little town... \n26   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, ALLEYWAY- DAY                         26 \nJACK turns casually down one of the town's many narrow alleyways. \nThe alleyway way bends left and right in a series of blind corners and dark tunnels, the street enclosed by arches, criss-crossed by flying stone buttresses and flanked by outside stairwells. It's a stalker's heaven- or hell- depending on how dangerous the prey. \nJACK proceeds along the alleyway until he gets to a crossroads where FOUR NARROW ALLEYWAYS converge. Each alleyway leads uphill or downhill with varying degrees of steepness. JACK photographs each alleyway. \nFrom an upstairs window he can hear the soundtrack of a game show on television. From another alleyway comes the sound of a barking dog. \nNo dog is visible. \nCurious, JACK turns around, walking back the way he came. \nThe sound of barking gets louder. \nOn his right hand side, JACK finds a HIDDEN ARCHWAY. \nThe HIDDEN ARCHWAY resembles an archer's slit but is big enough for a gown man to slip through. Unlike a window, the `slit' is actually just a crack in a triangular convergence of two separate and slightly overlapping ancient stone walls. The confluence of two stone surfaces makes the narrow gap between them very, very difficult to spot. \nJACK slips though the HIDDEN ARCHWAY. \nInside is a courtyard. \n27   INT. COURTYARD- DAY                                          27 \nRotting doors lead to abandoned cellars and storerooms. \nA MONGREL tied to a post is barking savagely, his leash keeping him inches from sinking his bared fangs into JACK. \nJACK stares at the dog: a mysterious creature of fear and fury. \n28   EXT. NARROW ALLEYWAY- DAY                                    28 \nJACK reappears through the HIDDEN ARCHWAY and slips back into the narrow alleyway. It's like he's materialised from thin air. \nHe takes 2 PHOTOGRAPHS: \n-first of the HIDDEN ARCHWAY \n-and then of the street sign: VIA ROMANA. \nJust then a MAN on an original 1970s DUCATI turns down the alleyway and drives towards him. \nCasually, JACK continues walking. \nThe DUCATI gets nearer. The MAN ON THE DUCATI is wearing a black crash helmet with a tinted visor. \nJACK picks up his pace. \nThe DUCATI is ten metres away. \nJACK's right hand moves towards his pocket. \nFive metres. \nJACK's hand goes in his pocket. \nTwo metres. \nBANG! \nJACK drops to his knees. \nBANG! \nThe DUCATI backfires for a second time. \nA pause. \nStill on his knees, JACK pretends to tie his right shoe lace. \nThe MAN ON THE DUCATI stops outside an apartment further up the alleyway, gets off his rickety motorbike and removes his helmet. He's a corpulent, ruddy faced Italian man in his late sixties. \n", "test1_true": "JACK stands. \nMAN ON DUCATI Buon giorno! \nJACK Buon giorno. \nMAN ON DUCATI Da dove provenite? \nFor an instant, the directness of the question catches JACK out. \nJACK America. \nMAN ON DUCATI Ah! L'Americano! \nJACK Si. Il Americano. \nJACK's pronunciation is good but his grammar is a bit rusty. Perhaps he's playing up on this. It suits the role of American tourist. \nThe MAN laughs enthusiastically emphasizing the correct grammar: \nMAN ON DUCATI L'Americano ! L'Americano! \nA WOMAN'S VOICE comes from within the house- loud and angry- distracting the MAN ON THE DUCATI, who screams back passionately, enters his front door, and shuts it behind him with a hearty slam. \nJACK walks on. \n29   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- DAY                      29 \nJACK puts some coins in a CIGARETTE MACHINE. \nThe MACHINE takes his money but won't dispense his cigarettes. \nHe hits the refund button but nothing happens. \nJACK checks the time. \nAnd thumps the machine hard. \nFootsteps. \nJACK adjusts his position and checks the time again. \nVOICE (O.S.) Can I help you? \nThe man behind him is reflected in the surface of JACK's battered ROLEX. \nJACK I'm no good with machines. \nJACK turns, smiling politely. \nThe PRIEST smiles back. \nHe is dressed in an ill-fitting, un-stylish black suit, a black silk stock and a deep Roman collar fraying at the edge. His name is FATHER BENEDETTO. He is older than JACK. \nFATHER BENEDETTO You are American. \nThis is stated matter-of-factly: like a man practising English. \nJACK Si. \nFATHER BENEDETTO You speak Italian? \nJACK Poco. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Va bene! You stay at Pensione Arbruzzo. \nAlso a statement: this time with touch of triumph. \nJACK is disconcerted but doesn't show it. \nJACK Not for much longer. \nFATHER BENEDETTO On vacation? \nJACK Working vacation. \nThis much is true- after a fashion. They speak in English unless otherwise specified: \nFATHER BENEDETTO Lavoro? Che genere de lavoro? \nJACK Photographer. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Va bene. Che genere de fotografia? \nJACK Pictures of the region. Architecture, landscapes... \nFATHER BENEDETTO People? \nHe stands straight and smiles winningly. \nJACK No people. Sights and landmarks. For guidebooks, magazines... \nFATHER BENEDETTO Ah! Magazine! Which magazine? \nJACK shows no discomfort. \nJACK Actually it's a syndicate. Lots of different publications. Um... Casa editrice. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Va bene. So you must share a glass of wine with me. Questa sera. This evening. \nA beat. \nJACK is slightly thrown. \nJACK You're very kind, but I... \nFATHER BENEDETTO Certo. You want to know the truth about Abruzzo? A priest sees everything. \n30   EXT.

L'AQUILA, VIA LAMPEDUSA, CLARA'S ROOM- NIGHT            48 \nOur beautiful twenty four year-old Italian girl enters. \nCLARA. \nShe sits on the edge of the bed, whose ageing metal springs squeak slightly, and puts her smoking cigarette in an ashtray on the bedside table. \nShe kicks off her slip-on shoes. \nSlips off her panties. \nLifts her light cotton dress over her head and lies back on the bed in one practised motion. \nJACK sits on the bed beside her. \nHe doesn't look at her. \nITALIAN GIRL Amore? \nShe reaches up to touch JACK as we cut to: \n49   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, PAY PHONE- DAY                        49 \nJACK is scanning the town square with his usual cautiousness. \nJACK Your source in Rome. \nLARRY (V.O.) Clean bill of health and no OC. This was a straight favour with a dollar chaser, Jack. The guy's got a second cousin in NOCS on the graft who filched him the Socimi. \nJACK I hope you paid below the odds. The more you pay them the more cops gossip in the locker room. \nLARRY (V.O.) No one's gossiping, Jack. \nJACK watches FATHER BENEDETTO waving at him from the other side of the square. \nJACK Yet. \n50   EXT. TOWN SQUARE- DAY                                         50 \nFATHER BENEDETTO is sitting in his API three-wheeler. \nThis comical and endearing method of rural transportation is a cross between a moped and a miniature pick-up truck. \nIn the back of the truck are a mass of writhing SNAKES. \nThe API is turning over but it won't start. \nThe bonnet is open. JACK is fixing the engine. \nHe gives a signal and FATHER BENEDETTO turns the ignition key again. \nThis time the engine starts. FATHER BENEDETTO claps and cheers. \n51   INT. FATHER BENEDETTO'S KITCHEN- EVENING                      51 \nSixteenth century. Sombre wood panelling stained dark with polish and smoke. Two paraffin lamps stand on a huge antique sideboard, their frosted orbs engraved with scenes from the life of Our Lord. \nThe room is filled with a dining table: a massive black edifice of oak, five inches thick with six legs fluted like the columns of cathedrals. \nUsing antique crockery, ancient copper pots and utensils like old fashioned instruments of torture FATHER BENEDETTO performs culinary alchemy: transforming flesh into meat, dough into bread, hard earth nuggets into vegetables. \nHe hums as he cooks: Opera arias. And Johnny Cash. \nJACK sips from a glass of wine and watches FATHER BENEDETTO potter around the wood fired stove. The priest has his own wine which he sips as he works between bouts of humming. \n52   INT. FATHER BENEDETTO'S KITCHEN- EVENING                      52 \nJACK eats a bowl of chilled carrot and sorrel soup in silence. \nFATHER BENEDETTO watches him, pleased to see his guest so absorbed. \nAs soon as JACK has finished, FATHER BENEDETTO invites him to help himself from the ancient tureen. \nThen he bustles over to the stove, humming again. \nJACK eats, studying a framed photo of FATHER BENEDETTO with his arm around a tough, corpulent Italian man in his mid- twenties. FABIO. \nFATHER BENEDETTO returns to the table with a large covered dish issuing steam into his face. \nHe notices JACK's eye-line. \nFATHER BENEDETTO All the sheep in my flock are dear to me, but some are dearer than most. Especially those that have strayed from the fold. \nOff JACK's intrigued look FATHER BENEDETTO clarifies: \nFATHER BENEDETTO Fabio. He is a... [in ITALIAN] 'car doctor'. But I suspect his practice is not entirely sound. Ecco! \nFATHER BENEDETTO whisks the lid off the covered dish revealing a stew of poultry carcasses covered in sauce. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Fagiano. Pheasant. With sauce of orange juice, orange peel, chestnuts, garlic, Marsala wine and... Come si dici in Inglese? Brodo di Pollo. Chicken broth. \nFATHER BENEDETTO serves each of them with a complete bird and pours white wine into fresh glasses. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Also: salsify in garlic butter. Mange-tout. Fried wild mushrooms with truffle. \nJACK helps himself to vegetables. \nFATHER BENEDETTO watches him as he savours his first taste. \nJACK licks his lips and sips some cold white wine. \nThe two men regard one another, the priest awaiting a verdict. \nJACK Sinful. \nFATHER BENEDETTO shrugs. \nFATHER BENEDETTO The Holy Father eats better than this. \nThe flash of a smile crosses the priest's face. \n", "test2_true": "FATHER BENEDETTO Have you ever wanted to be anything other than a... come se dice in Inglese...? \nJACK Photographer? \nFATHER BENEDETTO Photographer. \nJACK I do what I'm good at. \nFATHER BENEDETTO I'm sure you have other talents. You have the hands of a craftsman, not an artist. You are good with machines. Yet you told me just the opposite when we first met. \nJACK hides his unease from the watchful priest. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Journalism cannot make you a rich man. \nFATHER BENEDETTO's eyes flick over the ROLEX. \nJACK No. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Perhaps you are rich already? \nJACK I'm not a young man. I have my savings. \nFATHER BENEDETTO (in ITALIAN) My meagre income is subject to the vagaries of the stock market and with church attendance declining there's less and less money in the offertory. But if a man has God in his vaults... \nHe looks searchingly at JACK. \nJACK I don't think God is interested in me. Father. \nFATHER BENEDETTO (in ENGLISH) I know better than to try to make a convert over pheasant and Trebbiano. \nJACK is silent. \nThe two men continue eating. \nThen casually: \nJACK What are the snakes for, father? \nFATHER BENEDETTO taps the end of his nose in the universal sign for secrecy. \nFATHER BENEDETTO \"The grave soul keeps its own secrets, and takes its own punishment in silence.\" \nHe has a twinkle in his eye. The priest is on a mission to extract the truth... and JACK knows it. \n53   EXT.

COUNTRYSIDE- DAY                                        54 \nJust east of the old city walls a dirt track meanders downhill through a series of small holdings, allotments and scrap metal yards. \nThe CAR moves slowly. We can hear the scrape of trailing metal. \nJACK pulls up beside a high chain fence. \nThe DOGS on the other side start barking. This sets off other dogs in other scrap yards. \nJACK gets out of the car and approaches a makeshift hut beside the fence. Before he's a metre from the door it opens and a tough, well-built, unshaven Italian man in his mid- twenties looks him up and down. \nFABIO. \nJACK Sono un amico di Padre Benedetto. \nSuspicion gives way suddenly to warmth: \nFABIO L'Americano? \nJACK smiles politely. \nJACK Buon giorno. \n55   INT.

Beside it, one half of a LANCIA is being welded to another. \nJACK knows better than to stare. He follows FABIO through to... \n56   INT.

Father Benedetto said you might be able to help. \nFABIO (in ITALIAN) You need models. For your photographs? Italian girls? \nHe winks at JACK. He's being friendly. \nJACK My publisher wouldn't stretch to a four by four and the park trails are playing havoc with my chassis. \nThe technical English is slightly beyond FABIO's grasp. \nThis suits JACK. \nFABIO (in ITALIAN) Want me to take a look? \nJACK Not really. I just need something to work on a ruptured driveshaft. \nFABIO (in ITALIAN) You're a mechanic? \nJACK Just a hobby. I tinker. \n", "test2_id": 1213, "test3_input": "LARRY (V.O.)

L'AQUILA, CORSO FREDERICO II - DAY                      113 \nThe colonnades of this popular pedestrain street are crowded with window shoppers, tourists taking coffee, old men discussing politics and office girls walking hand in hand and chattering like songbirds. \nJACK is in dark glasses. He's sitting in a coffee shop under the colonnade sucking a fruit drop and reading a copy of Il Messagiero. \nC.U. we see he's studying a small column concerning the murder of two prostitutes in the nearby city of Chieti. \nJACK spots CLARA walking along the corso. She's with a girl he has not seen before. ANNA. ANNA is small town girl with a keen sense of fashion. She and CLARA are hand in hand. \nCLARA sees JACK and speaks to her friend. \nThey cross through the throng of boulevardiers. \nCLARA My friend Anna. This is my friend Signor Farfalla. \nCLARA's eyes twinkle mischievously. \nThe girls cease to hold hands and ANNA offers hers to JACK. JACK half rises like the perfect gentlemen, folding his newspaper and accepting ANNA's greeting. \nJACK How do you do? \nANNA I am very well thank you. \nAh. This is to be an impromptu English lesson. JACK acquiesces gracefully. \nJACK Will you take a coffee with me? \nCLARA That would be very good. \nHe indicates two empty chairs. \nJACK Prego. \nCLARA moves her chair to sit closer to JACK. Under the table, her knee presses against his. \nANNA also moves her chair nearer to JACK: but her motive is to move it out of the sun. She is not flirting. \nCLARA Anna is learning English. \nJACK Have you been to England? \nANNA seems momentarily confused. \nANNA But you are... \nShe looks at CLARA. \nANNA Lui Americano? \nJACK I am. \nJACK glances at CLARA. \nHow much has she told her friend? \nANNA Ah. I have not been to England only to France. But I would love to go to America. \nThe WAITER comes over. \nJACK Due cappuccini e un cafe corretto. \nCLARA Anna is like all Italians. She thinks America is like in the movies. Little Italy, \"West Side Story\", \"Chicago\". (MORE) \nCLARA (cont'd) I tell her in these times America is like here, there, anywhere. The streets are not... pave-ed with gold. \nShe beams happily at JACK. He smiles back at her. \nJACK If not with gold, than at least not with enough medieval cobbles to loosen every-self tapping screw in a Fiat. \nJACK beams. Neither girl understands. But everyone smiles happily. \nThe WAITER brings the coffee and CLARA insists on paying. \nJACK Where do you come from, Anna? \nANNA frowns. JACK plays teacher. \nJACK Dove abita? \nANNA Ah, yes! I live in Via dell' Argilla. Nearby to Clara. \nJACK briefly wonders what else he could teach her. He scans both girls and decides CLARA is the prettier. CLARA seems to sense this. She smiles to herself. \nJACK is touched. \n114   EXT. CORSO FREDERICO II, L'AQUILA- DAY                      114 \nWe cut wide and watch JACK talk inconsequentialities with the girls. They stand to go. JACK rises. \nCLARA Perhaps we will have a drink together soon? I am free... \n", "test3_true": "CLARA ...on Monday. \nJACK Great. I'll see you then. \nCLARA But Eduardo... Where would you like to meet? \nAgain: rehearsed. JACK is not expecting this. CLARA looks at him mischievously. ANNA is listening. \nJACK How about our usual place? \nCLARA Our usual place? \nShe feigns complete perplexity. \nCLARA I forgot. Where is our usual place? \nJACK You've forgotten? \nCLARA Remind me. \nThe twinkle in her eye. She's testing him. JACK is the perfect gentleman. \nJACK Maybe we should try something different. \nCLARA Where would you like to try, Eduardo? \nA beat. JACK spots a restaurant on the opposite side of the road. \nJACK Locanda Grapelli? \nThere is no warmth in his suggestion. But CLARA doesn't care. \nCLARA Locanda Grapelli! Si! \nShe looks genuinely delighted. \nANNA This is the best food in the area. \nJACK Good. \nCLARA Seven? \nJACK Seven. \nCLARA Locanda Grapelli. \nJACK Locanda Grapelli. \nCLARA You'll be there? \nJACK I'll be there. \nCLARA See you then, Eduardo. \nJACK See you then, Clara. It was a delight to meet you Anna. Arrivederci. \nANNA Arrivederci, Signor Farfalla. \nThere is an unmistakable twinkle in ANNA's eye. How much she knows is uncertain. She kisses him swiftly and softly on the cheek. \nCLARA does the same on the lips. Behind the mischief in her eyes is something doubtful. Has she gone too far? \n115   EXT. DOWNTOWN L'AQUILA- DAY                                115 \nJACK visits three stores: \n-In a PHOTOGRAPHIC SHOP he buys half a dozen FILM PROTECTION BAGS. \n-In a HABERDASHERS he purchases several packets of HOOKS and EYES like the kind you find on brassieres. \n-In a OFFICE SUPPLY SHOP he buys some custom made headed notepaper, invoice books, notepads, envelopes, metal pens, a calculator and a mobile phone. \n116   INT. JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT                                    116 \nJACK opens a black combination lock SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE and lines the bottom and sides with the lead-lined film protection bags, cut to fit. \nInto the base of the briefcase he glues pre-shaped pieces of firm grey plastic foam. These form the pockets into which he slots the constituent parts of the SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN. They fit perfectly. \nOver this JACK uses the HOOKS and EYES to clip a false bottom: a tough card cover onto which are pasted the custom made headed notepaper, invoice books, notepads and envelopes. \nTo the briefcase's central divider he adds the metal pens, a calculator and a mobile phone. He sets the combination to 821. Then shuts and locks the BRIEFCASE. \nThis done he sits on the bed and stares at the case. With his work complete, he is struck by a terrible sense of emptiness. \n117   EXT. PARCO DELLA RESISTENZA - JUST BEFORE DAWN              117 \nA small park not far from Castel Del Monte's town square. \nIt is just after dawn. The pine trees and the poplars are silent. The sun is not yet up but the day is light. Sparrows hop about, searching for crumbs. \nJACK, ravaged by lack of sleep, wonders about like the demon of a lost darkness, looking for his hole down to the underworld. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Buon giorno! \nHe's twenty meters away, his hand raised in half-welcome, half-benediction. \nThey greet one another and FATHER BENEDETTO falls into slow step with JACK. The priest walks with his hands behind his back. JACK with his hands in his pockets. \nFATHER BENEDETTO I walk here to meditate. Once a week, Wednesday, the farthest one can travel in the week from the Sabbath. The trees are like the Stations of the Cross: by certain trees I thank God for certain favours he has granted me, or certain gifts he has made to me and all men. For example, here by this pine, I thank him for the many friendships I have and ask him to look after those of my friends who are troubled. \nThey reach a Cypress tree and FATHER BENEDETTO bows his head in prayer. After a while he says: \nFATHER BENEDETTO Some walk here in the cool of evening. Others come at night. \nThere is a slight sadness in his voice as he says to himself: \nFATHER BENEDETTO I wonder how many bastards have been made here? \nHe gives a small sideways glance at JACK. \nFATHER BENEDETTO Perhaps you'll stay and settle here yourself? \n", "test3_id": 1214}

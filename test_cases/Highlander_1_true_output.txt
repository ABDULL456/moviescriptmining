EXAMINER Hope this isn't past your bedtime. 
Brenna looks to the now-sheeted corpse, blood flowing from where the head should be. 
BRENNA Doesn't have a head, does he? 
EXAMINER This one came unassembled. 
Lt. Moran is standing near. 
MORAN (no warmth) Just show her what she came for, Tom. 
EXAMINER (stands, taps Brenna's arm) Come on, this is more your line of work. 
Brenna and the examiner walk the few yards from the corpse to the sword. 
EXAMINER How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore. 
BRENNA Fine. 
The examiner stops and gestures to the weapon clothed in forensic plastic. 
EXAMINER There you go. 
Brenna's expression changes to interest as she kneels down beside it. 
EXAMINER Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you. 
BRENNA (looks up in Moran's direction) Didn't think it was my buddy over there. 
EXAMINER Figured you knew more about swords than I did. 
BRENNA Claymore. 
EXAMINER Huh? 
BRENNA Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore. 
EXAMINER You're the expert. 
BRENNA (runs hand along hilt, slightly confused) It's in good condition. 
RICHARD TAUPIN 
Is being put in the rear of a patrol car.  Brenna studies his face in the half-gloom.  There's something different about him. A steadiness. 
13  INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM                                  13 
Richard Taupin is seated at a graffitti scrawled table in a room otherwise bare of furnishings.  He seems unphased by his surroundings. 
The door opens and Moran enters with bag and notebook.  He picks up Taupin's wallet on the table top and checks the driver's license. 
MORAN This your present address? 
TAUPIN Yes. 
MORAN Mr.- (looks at license) Taupin, what were you doing in that alley? 
TAUPIN I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after. 
MORAN Did you know the victim? 
TAUPIN No. 
MORAN His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory. 
TAUPIN It doesn't. 
MORAN He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week. 
Taupin's face is stoic and controlled. 
MORAN Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week. (beat) What is your citizenship? 
TAUPIN American. 
Moran paces to a corner of the room. 
MORAN Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night? 
TAUPIN What are you getting at? 
MORAN Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street. 
Moran places both hands on the table and leans across it.

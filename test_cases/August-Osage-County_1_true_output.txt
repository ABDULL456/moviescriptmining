She opens the door. Over her we FIND: Violet, entombed in her room. Squinting against the intrusive hall light. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) Mom, wake up, the sheriff's here. 
VIOLET Did you call them?    I dig in call them. 
BARBARA Mom.    The sheriff is here. 
VIOLET Inna esther? 
BARBARA What? 
VIOLET Inna esther broke. `N pays me `em...sturck...struck. 
BILL Come on.   Leave her there. 
Barbara does, starts for the staircase, meets the just awakened Jean coming out of her room, concerned. 
BILL (CONT'D) Go back to bed, sweetheart.... 
Barbara descends the stairs, trailed by Bill. The SHERIFF waits on the porch, late-forties, handsome, Stetson in hand. 
They go to him, but WE HANG BACK with Jean, watching the scene outside unfold. Bill shakes the Sheriff's hand. The Sheriff speaks earnestly to Barbara and Bill. 
We can't hear what's being said, only murmurs until -- Barbara sinks to her knees. Bill holds her. Jean watches. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   45. 
37   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                         37 
Johnna enters, snaps on the light, starts a pot of coffee. Stoic, inscrutable. 
38   EXT. WESTON HOUSE DRIVEWAY - JUST BEFORE DAWN                38 
A big pre-dawn sky is changing from black to blue. The Sheriff walks to his cruiser, kills the flashers. Bill joins him, still barefoot. 
BILL What happened? 
SHERIFF Couple old boys running jug lines in the lake hooked him. Pulled him up. 
BILL He drowned. That's how he died, from drowning? 
SHERIFF Looks it.     Yes, sir. 
Bill looks off.   Song birds begin their pre-dawn chatter. 
BILL Is there any way to determine if he... I mean is this an accident, or suicide --? 
SHERIFF There's really no way to tell. 
BILL What's your guess? 
SHERIFF ...Suicide. 
And now the full weight of it hits Bill. After a moment -- 
BILL How does a a person jump in the water... and choose not to swim? 
39   INT. WESTON GIRL'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN                        39 
Barb pulls on clothes, rakes a brush through her hair. Jean appears in the door, watches her. After a moment: "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   46. 39   CONTINUED:                                                   39 
JEAN What about Aunt Ivy? 
BARBARA I guess we'll stop on the way. Christ, I need to call Karen, too. Why the fuck am I brushing my hair? 
She drops the brush. And then an odd sound intrudes from downstairs, a song: "Lay Down, Sally" by Eric Clapton. 
40   INT. LIVING ROOM - PRE-DAWN                                  40 
The music is LOUD. We follow Barbara and Jean halfway down the stairs to REVEAL: Violet, high as a kite, doing a jerky little dance by the stereo. The Sheriff stands uncomfortably by the door, his hat in hand. She shuffles over to him. 
VIOLET Izza story. Barely's back.    Did sum Beer-ley come home? 
SHERIFF Ma'am? 
VIOLET Gizza cig... some cigezze?    Cig-zezz, cig-zizz... cig-uhzzz... 
She laughs at her inability to speak. He takes a Pall Mall from his shirt pocket, hands it to her. Lights it for her. 
VIOLET (CONT'D) In the archa, archa-tex? I'm in the bottom. Inna bottom of them. (and) Mm, good beat, right? 
He nods.   Bill comes back in from outside. 
VIOLET (CONT'D) Barbara?! Is Barbara here?! 
BARBARA (quietly) Right here, Mom... 
Johnna steps in from the kitchen, pensively observing. 
VIOLET Mm, good beat, right?   Idn't it's a good beat? (MORE) "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   47. 40   CONTINUED:                                                   40 VIOLET (CONT'D) Mmmm, I been on the music... pell man onna sheriff. Armen in tandel s'lossle, s'lost? Lost?! From the day, the days. Am Beerly... and Beverly lost? 
Violet abandons her dance, separates invisible threads in the air. The others stand frozen, staring at her. 
VIOLET (CONT'D) And then you're here. And Barbara, and then you're here, and Beverly, and then you're here, and then you're here, and then you're here, and then you're here, and then you're here...

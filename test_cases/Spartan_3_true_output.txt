Scott opens the back door of the Cruiser, and the Heavyset Man gets out, and offers his manacled hands for release. Scott motions to Assani. 
SCOTT ...drag him out... (the man does so. Scott motions for them to be quiet) ...got some business to do... 
He takes his pistol and walks toward the farmhouse. 
HOLD on Assani, and the other Convict, Assani is holding a rag to his bleeding neck. 
ASSANI ...help me... 
HEAVYSET CONVICT ...yeah, I heard yah... 
ANGLE, on Scott, as he walks past a clothesline heavy with drying clothes, he is seen to go into the house. We hear a woman's scream, and then two shots are fired. 
ANGLE INT. THE HOUSE. As Scott is found at a table in the kitchen next to which are various foodstuffs laid out. Inside the house we see a female techie, at a table by the wall, various communications gear in front of her. Scott begins loading up his pockets with food. The techie hands Scott a slate on which is written, in large block letters, "The helo is standing by, will assault in support when you have found the girl. On your command." Scott gestures for the slate, and writes on it, and hands it back. Scott nods, and walks out of the house. 
ANGLE INSERT. The slate, on which we see Scott has written "Keep Your Distance!" 
ANGLE, on Scott, as he walks back through the yard, pulling clothes off the line. 
ANGLE INT. THE BARN. The two convicts, as Scott enters, and begins changing out of his clothes, and into the clothes he found on the line. 
HEAVYSET CONVICT Yeah, Baby. Pass some my way... 
SCOTT Sorry, my man...traveling light... 
He turns to the Heavyset Man, and fires his revolver at him twice. The man falls, dead. Scott turns his revolver at Assani, who begins to scream. 
ASSANI Don't shoot me, don't shoot me, I have what you want. I HAVE WHAT YOU WANT. I CAN GET US OUT OF THE COUNTRY TONIGHT. TONIGHT. NO PASSPORT. FLY OUT. TONIGHT...OH GOD, DON'T SHOOT ME! I SWEAR ON MY MOTHER. LOOK AT ME: AM I LYING TO YOU? A SEA PLANE. TONIGHT. HELP ME. I SWEAR TO YOU. 
SCOTT Why in the world would I believe a lying convict like you... 
ASSANI Oh, ah, ah, but you do believe me...I see it...you do. I can get us out. Help me. I SWEAR TO YOU. HELP ME...and I will treat you like a brother...I... 
Scott advances on him. 
SCOTT My brother used to beat me (he raises the cop's service revolver and cocks the hammer) Nice guess, though. 
ASSANI OH GOD NO! 
Scott pulls the trigger, which falls on an empty chamber. Assani whimpers, as Scott goes into the Cruiser, comes out with a box of shells, clears the empties from the cop's gun, and begins loading it. 
ASSANI No, no. Listen to me...listen...make one call. One call - go in the house. Make One Call. ONE CALL. An Aviation Company. Tell...tell them...tell them the word I say, and they will say: THE PLANE WILL MEET YOU AT... (Scott hesitates for a moment, and Assani attempts to capitalize on it) Yes. Yes... 
INT. PICK-UP TRUCK. DAY. 
Scott is driving. The dash is littered with empty coffeecups, cigarette packs. He turns. 
ANGLE HIS POV. Assani, sitting in the shotgun seat, a map in his lap, looking at him. 
SCOTT You a fag my friend? 
ASSANI No. (pause) I am not. 
SCOTT Then why the hell you looking at me? 
ASSANI I was thinking...how fucking surprised you're going to be. (pause) Because, Baby, you just did that fucken good turn, going to Make You Rich, Fat, and Happy... 
SCOTT ...just get me on that plane. 
ASSANI Didn't they tell you...? 
SCOTT All I heard's a voice on the phone... 
Assani grins, as if to say, "Just Wait". 
ASSANI ...you like girls...? 
SCOTT Better question, where you've been so long, do you like girls? 
Scott grins, and Assani shares the moment with him. 
ASSANI We have. You will have...the most beautiful... 
SCOTT ...most beautiful women, eh? 
ASSANI Not women, Baby. Girls. You got to trust me, I'm the Doctor here...All young. All blonde... 
SCOTT And this all takes place Where...? 
ASSANI In Dubai. In Yemen...

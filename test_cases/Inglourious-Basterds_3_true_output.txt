LT. ALDO How do you know our names? 
COL.LANDA Lt.Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika marked survivors... .? We simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed. Now, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs. At this moment, both Hirschberg, and Donowitz, should be sitting in the very seats we left them in. Seats, 0023 and 0024, if my memory serves. Explosives, still around there ankle, still ready to explode. And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go. The two Basterds don't believe this. It can't be true. 
LT. ALDO That's a pretty exciting story. What's next, Eliza on the ice? 
COL.LANDA However, all I have to do, is pick pick up that phone right there. Inform the cinema, and your plans kupet. 
LT. ALDO IF, their still there, and IF their still alive, and that's one big IF, there ain't no way, you gonna take them boys without settin off them bombs. 
I R.T. 
COL.LANDA 
M I have no doubt, and yes, some Germans will die., and yes, it will ruin the evening, and yes, Goebbels will be very very very mad at you for what you've done to his big night. But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Gering, and you won't get Boorman. And you need all four to end the war. 
(PAUSE) But if I don't pick up that phone, right there, you may very well get all four. And if you get all four, you end the war...tonight. The Nazi Colonel lifts up the bottle of Chianti, and fills three glasses. As he pours, he says; 
COL.LANDA So gentlemen, lets discuss the prospect of ending the war-tonight. All three have their Chianti filled glasses. 
COL.LANDA So the way I see it, since Hitlers death, or possible rescue, rests solely on my reaction...If I do nothing ...it's as if I'm causing his death, even more then yourselves. Would you agree? 
LT. ALDO I guess so. 
COL.LANDA How about you Uitivich? 
UITIVICH I guess so too. 
COL.LANDA Good, we more or less, all agree. Gentlemen, I have no intention, of Killing Hitler, and killing Goebbels, and Killing Gerring, and killing Boorman, not to mention winning the war single handedly for the allies, only later, to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal. 
I q Now they get it. 
COL.LANDA If you want to win the war, tonight, We have to make a deal. 
LT.ALDO What kinda deal? 
COL.LANDA The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make. However, I'm sure this mission of yours, has a commanding officer? A General, I'm betting. For .. 
(THINKING) .O.S.S. would be my guess. Aldo's eyebrows reveal that was a good guess. 
COL.LANDA Oooh, that's a bingo. Is that the way you say it, That's a bingo? 
LT.ALDO You just say, bingo. 
COL.LANDA Bingo! How fun. But I digress, where were we? Oh yes, make a deal. Over there is a very capable two way radio. And sitting behind it, is a more then capable radio operator, named Herrman. Get me somebody on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen, to authorize my - Let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender, if that taste better going down. 
BACK TO THE PREMIERE Shosanna in the booth, she brings down the lights. In the packed, excited auditorium, the house lights go down. CU CURTAIN SWITCH, she flips it. In the auditorium, the RED VELVET CURTAINS part. Shosanna, throws the lever on the first projector. 
I q7 . The PROJECTOR BULB goes HOT WHITE, PROJECTING A BEAM... FILM REELS rotate... 35mm FILM moves through the projectors film gate... The opening seal of a film by The THIRD REICH flickers on the 
SCREEN... Goebbels and Francesca watch... Hitler watches... Fredrick watches... Donowitz and Hirschberg watch... Shosanna, in the booth, watches through the little window... The CAMERA PANS OFF of Shosanna, to the clearly marked film can, REEL FOUR. The SURPRISE REEL. 
BACK TO LANDA AND THE HASTERDS Landa, with radio headphones over his ears, and a microphone in his hand, talks to the UNSEEN/UNHEARD American Brass on the other end. 
COL.LANDA .So, when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded, that I was part of "Operation Rino" from the very beginning, as a double agent. Anything I've done in my guise as a SS Colonel, was sanctioned by The O.S.S., as a necessary evil to establish my cover with The Germans. And it was my placement, of Lt.Raines dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels opera box that assured there demise. By the way, that last part is actually true. 
FLASH ON Landa placing bomb in Goebbels and Francesca's opera box. 
BACK TO LANDA 
COL.LANDA I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank. I want to receive the congregational medal of honor, for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich. 
He looks over and sees Aldo and Uitvich watching the one sided conversation. 
COL.LANDA In fact, I want all the members of "Operation Kino" to receive the congregational medal of honor. Full citizenship for myself - but that goes without saying. And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantuckett island, as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist party to a swifter then imanged end. Do you have all that, sir? 
(PAUSE) I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir. 
(PAUSE) He's right here. The Colonel hands the headphones and microphone to Aldo. 
LT.ALDO Yes, sir? We HEAR the VOICE on the other end of the radio, give Aldo his 
ORDERS; 
RADIO VOICE(OS) Colonel Landa will put you and Private Uitivich in a truck as prisoners. Then he and his radio operator, will get in the truck, drive to our lines. Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you. You will then take over driving of the truck, a bring them straight to me for debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant? 
LT.ALDO Yes, sir. The Conversation is over, he puts the radio down. The three men look at one another. Landa picks up his wine. 
Ito . 
COL.LANDA So I suppose the only thing left to do is lift a glass, and toast to Donowitz and Hirschbergs success. You too Herrman, come over here. The four men, Col.Hans Landa, Lt.Aldo Raine, Pvt.Smithson Uitivich, and Herrman, lift up four glasses of wine. 
COL.LANDA Gentlemen, To history, and it's Witnesses.

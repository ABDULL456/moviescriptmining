RIGGAN Okay, let me-- 
MIKE Come on. Give it to me right now. Fuck me. Right now. Right here. Let's do it. 
RIGGAN Okay, yeah... 
MIKE DO IT! RIGGAN (Jumps in w/out thinking.) "Hey. I'm the wrong person to ask, okay? I didn't even know the guy. So what's your point?" 
MIKE "What's my point?" 
RIGGAN "What's your point? What are you saying? Spit it out. You're saying, what? That love is an absolute?" (CONTINUED) 
MIKE (Exploding.) "Yeah! Alright? The kind of love I'm talking about is absolute. The kind of love I'm talking about you-- (A painful memory.) Well, you don't try to kill people. 
Riggan stands silently, his heart pounding. 
MIKE (CONT'D) So what do you think, boss? Do I have a job? 
Riggan calls over to the wings. 
RIGGAN What do you think? 
Mike turns to see Sam, who has been there for a bit. SAM Larry needs to see him for a fitting. 
MIKE I'm gonna take that as a yes. (Walking to Sam.) And you are...? 
RIGGAN That's my daughter, Sam. 
MIKE Right. Yeah. I can see it around the... (A beat) She doesn't look anything like you. (To Sam.) And your job is...? 
RIGGAN She's my assistant. MIKE Your assistant... (To Sam.) And can you speak? 
SAM Yup. I can even 'sit', 'stay' or 'roll over' if you have any treats. 
RIGGAN Welcome aboard, Mike. 
(CONTINUED) 
MIKE (Mock saluting.) Thank you, Captain. 
We follow Mike and Sam off as they... 
8   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            8 
...advance through the hallways. 
MIKE I'm Mike Shiner, by the way. 
SAM I know who you are. (Reluctantly honest.) I saw you in 'Hothouse' at the Geffen. It was... great. 
MIKE That ass is great. 
She turns her head toward him with a disgusted expression. 
SAM Dude. Seriously? 
Moving by her, into a dressing room. 
MIKE This is the theatre, honey. Don't be so self-conscious. 
She follows him into the room where we see... 
9   INT. COSTUME DEPARTMENT - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                 9 
...Larry stressing out while he works on a costume. He turns to see Mike standing there. Sam stands against the wall, focused on her cell phone. 
LARRY Oh, thank the Lord and pass the biscuits! I finally have an actor to dress. Hello, Mr. Shiner. 
MIKE How're you doing, Larry? 
LARRY Better, now that you're here. Take off your clothes. 
(CONTINUED) 
Mike takes off his shirt and hands it to Sam. She doesn't budge, and it hits the floor. He begins to unbutton his pants...

Michael screwing the hell out of Tina. 
TINA Easy baby, easy. 
SLOW MOTION INTERCUT: 
SUITE: 
Moore wildly leaps from the couch to the chair, to another chair, back to the couch... 
BATHROOM: 
Michael plows like a monster into Tina, hands tied behind her back... 
CLOSE ON her stiletto heels, digging into the marble floor... One of her heels breaks... she starts to slip... 
SUITE: 
Moore jumps, misses the chair, falling down on the glass coffee table, GLASS EXPLODES... 
BATHROOM: 
Tina falls, Michael reaches too late, she can't break her fall with her hands tied behind her... she's going down... 
SUITE: 
Moore falls through the shattered glass, to the floor... 
BATHROOM: 
Tina hits her head hard on the porcelain toilet... 
SUITE: 
Fisher, Adam, and Boyd stop brawling, stare down at Moore covered in glass. 
MOORE (beat) Cool. 
Moore is fine, not even a scratch. The guys break into ROARING LAUGHTER, completely HYSTERICAL; shaking, roaring, releasing. TIGHT SHOTS of each HOWLING until... 
One by one... they sober up... looking O.C. 
TIGHT ON FISHER as his smile slowly fades to confusion, he stares O.C. at... 
MICHAEL 
Standing in the door, face ghost white, blood dripping from his fingers... 
MICHAEL I really fucked up. 
INT. BATHROOM 
The guys rush in. Stop dead in their tracks. 
TINA 
On the floor, legs twisted underneath her, lies growing in a growing puddle of dark blood. SILENCE as the guys stare, trying to comprehend. 
MOORE Jesus. 
ADAM Don't touch her. Call 911. 
MICHAEL (in shock) I was just playing... we were playing just playing around. 
ADAM (examines Tina) She's dead. 
FISHER No... No. 
MOORE How do you know she's dead. 
ADAM She's got no fucking pulse. 
BOYD You don't know what you're doing. 
Boyd pushes Adam out of the way. Starts feeling her pulse. 
BOYD (not getting anything) Where do you look? What side of the neck? 
MOORE Left side. 
ADAM Either side you idiot. I'm calling

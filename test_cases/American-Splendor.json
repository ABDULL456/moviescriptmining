He seems to be observing them more than interacting with them. \nGUY #3 Right Marty? I heard ya went out with Bonnie yesterday. \nPAHLS Yeah. Howdja do? Wudja git offa her? \nMARTY Ah, lousy.

SOUND STAGE - PRESENT - DAY \nHIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE \nCLOSE UP: \nA COPY OF AMERICAN SPLENDOR #2: A FULL-COLOR CARTOON VERSION OF THE ABOVE SCENE GRACES THE COVER. \nA MARTY LOOK-ALIKE is bombarded with questions about his date with Bonnie. He complains that all he got was \"arm- around.\" The REAL HARVEY holds the above comic book in his hand. The stage is set with a few items that indicate a comic book store. HARVEY talks about a couple of \"American Splendor\" issues and how they impacted his life -- recognition as a writer, etc. He gives his philosophy about the comic book, etc. A MONTAGE OF AMERICAN SPLENDOR COVERS (ISSUE #3, #4, #5, #6, ETC.) THEY INDICATE A PASSAGE OF TIME... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HARVEY'S CUBICLE - V.A. HOSPITAL - 1980'S - DAY \nHARVEY sits alone in his cubicle. He doodles stick figures on a pad -- some ideas for a new comic. His posture's miserable. He rubs his temples like he's in anguish. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) Here's our man eight comics later, a brand new decade, same old bullshit. Yeah sure, he gets lots of recognition for his writin' now. Sure his comics are praised by all the important media types tellin' people what to think. But so what?  It's not like he makes a livin' at it like Bob Crumb. He can't go an' quit his day job or nothin'. \nJUMP CUT SEQUENCE \nSeveral shots of Harvey just thinking, scratching his face with a pencil, tapping his foot nervously. \nEach shot is separated by a second or two of black (an homage to Harvey's wordless panels). Finally, he goes back to writing. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) Who am I kiddin'. Truth is I'd be lost without my work routine. \nFLASH CUT TO: \nINT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - NIGHT \nAlone in bed, Harvey wakes up in a cold sweat from a nightmare. He looks horrified, short of breath. \nHARVEY (calming himself down) I got a job... I got a job... \nBACK TO: \nINT. HARVEY'S CUBICLE - V.A. HOSPITAL - 1980'S - DAY \nHARVEY scratches his head. \nCLOSE UP ON HIS DOODLING \nHarvey writes \"I got a job\" in a balloon over the stick figure's head. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) So -- to stave off desperation and feelings of uselessness -- I resigned myself to a menial existence. But hey, maybe the guy who's had a happy life feels worse just before he dies than th' guy who had a sad one. Or, maybe not. I dunno. Maybe I just needed a woman. \nToby comes in, decked out in plaid and stripes. He has an empty messenger bag. \nTOBY Hi, Harvey. Do you want these gourmet jelly beans? I gave up sweets for lent. \nHarvey turns around. He seems down, depressed. \n", "test1_true": "Toby watches Harvey eat a few. \nHARVEY Hey, watermelon. That's pretty good. \nTOBY I recommend the pi\u00f1a coladas. They are excellent and very authentic tasting. \nToby heads down a file row and proceeds to take a few off the shelves, stuffing his bag. Harvey gets up and comes after him. \nHARVEY Hey Toby, can you eat lentils during lent? \nTOBY Sure. I don't see why not. You can't eat meat on certain days, but lentils should be acceptable anytime. \nHARVEY Ya think there's any connection between lentils and lent? \nTOBY I don't think so but I'll ask Sister Mary Fred at church on Sunday. \nHARVEY Sister Mary Fred, huh? Is she cute? Sounds kinda mannish but who am I to be picky. \nTOBY Harvey, you're funny. She's a nun. \nHARVEY So what? Maybe she became a nun because she couldn't get a guy. \nTOBY Harvey, she became a nun because she had a higher calling. \nHARVEY Higher calling. That is such a crock of shit. I don't know why you waste your time prayin' anyway. \nTOBY Well, Harvey, I like the ritual. And I'm a very spiritual person. You know, you should try believing in something bigger than yourself. It might cheer you up. \nToby turns on his heels and walks off. \nHARVEY (calling after him) What? Do I seem depressed, Toby? \nToby doesn't respond. \nHarvey shrugs and digs deep into the jelly bean bag. He pulls out a fistful. \nCLOSE ON HARVEY'S HAND \nJellybeans in every imaginable color. Harvey fingers a few and then picks a blue one. \nBOB THE DIRECTOR (V.O.) Cut! \nCUT TO: \nINT. V.A. HOSPITAL \"SET\" - PRESENT - DAY \nHIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE \nA few items from the previous scene are present on the sound stage indicating that it's a set of AMERICAN SPLENDOR -- The Movie. \nTHE ACTOR HARVEY stands alone, his hand filled with Jelly beans. \nBOB THE DIRECTOR Okay, that was great. The bakery scene is next... \nACTOR HARVEY steps out of the frame, revealing a craft service table behind him. At the table, the REAL HARVEY and the REAL TOBY load up on donuts. The two discuss the food on the set. \nIronically, the Real Toby is actually more extreme than the Actor who plays him -- even more robotic, and completely incapable of eye-contact. \nThe REAL TOBY discusses the finer points of nerdom and evaluates the Actor's nerd quotient. The Real Harvey explains to Actor Toby that nothing -- not even gourmet jelly beans -- would have cheered him up at that point in his life. \nHe was too lonely and depressed. \nEND HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Okay, maybe I was bein' so harsh on Toby onna count a' my own problems. \nREAL HARVEY Y'see, I wasn't even married a month and my old lady was already showin' signs a' trouble. Granted, I tend ta get married fast 'cause I'll take any woman that'll have me, but this time I really met my match... \nCUT TO: \nINT. REHEARSAL STUDIO - PRESENT - DAY \nHIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE \nA few items indicating film production are in the frame. \nAt a table in the foreground, BOB THE DIRECTOR discusses the character of Joyce with the ACTRESS playing her. The actress just nods as the director goes on. \nWe can see THE REAL JOYCE sitting with THE REAL HARVEY in the distance. \nDIRECTOR Okay, I think the thing with Joyce is that as manic as Harvey can be, she matches him with depression. In that way they complete each other. I mean, she's obviously a very smart woman, but she has a lot of trouble functioning in a world she can't control. And she's totally obsessed with all things negative; y'know, diseases, dysfuctions, etc. \nTHE REAL JOYCE and REAL HARVEY listen curiously -- sometimes pleased, sometimes displeased -- as their personalities are dissected and boiled down to a few phrases. \nCLOSER SHOT OF REAL JOYCE AND HARVEY \nThe REAL JOYCE puts in her two cents about the actress playing her. She rants about what it's like to be portrayed in a movie, and having a character arc imposed on her life. \nShe moves into talking about her relationship with Harvey, and the first years of their marriage -- how impossible it was to live with him. \nThe REAL HARVEY just rolls his eyes. \nEND HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE \nCUT TO: \nINT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY \nJOYCE is on a cleaning rampage. She rummages through piles upon piles of records while HARVEY paces nervously. \nJOYCE What about these 78's, Harvey? Can't you sell them to one of those collectors? \nHARVEY Are ya kidding? No way, man. I ain't getting rid of my 78's. \nJoyce throws down the records in frustration. Harvey runs over to check if they're scratched. \nJOYCE (angry) Forget it then. I give up! How can I make more storage space, if you won't get rid of anything? \nHARVEY I'll get rid of stuff. Just not my good stuff. \nJOYCE Everything's your good stuff. How am I supposed to live here, if there's no room for me? \nHARVEY Aw come on, baby. I'll make room for ya. You just have to give me time. I'm not so good at these kind of things. \nJOYCE That's because you're obsessive compulsive Harvey. \nA DOOR BUZZER rings. Harvey slams it to unlock the front. \nHARVEY C'mon. I don't wanna hear that psychobabble crap! \nJOYCE I don't care if you wanna hear it or not. You're the poster child for the DSM III. I'll have you know that I come from a very dysfunctional family. I can spot personality disorders a mile away... \nA KNOCK ON THE DOOR interrupts their argument. Joyce storms away to answer it. \nANGLE ON THE DOOR: \n", "test2_true": "TOBY Hello Joyce.

With pictures an' words, a guy can do pretty much anything! \nSTAGE ACTOR JOYCE That's true, Harvey. But I didn't come all the way from Delaware to talk about comics ... \nThe \"Stage Actor Joyce\" lunges over and plants a kiss on him. \nANGLE ON HARVEY AND JOYCE IN AUDIENCE \nHarvey digs it but Joyce looks disgusted. \nBACK TO STAGE \nWe now see STAGE ACTOR HARVEY clutching a tea cup, as STAGE ACTOR JOYCE kneels before a toilet bowl.

That day on the set with those MTV jerks, I had an epiphany. It seemed that real, salt of the earth people like Toby an' me were bein' coopted by these huge corporations.

What can I say, it was the 80's man. \nCUT TO: \nMTV PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT \nTOBY, dressed in dark sunglasses and a turtleneck, stands in front of a White Castle.

Say yes to White Castle! \nCUT TO: \nINT. CLEVELAND DINER - 1980'S - DAY \nHARVEY and JOYCE eat breakfast together. Harvey reads a Katherine Mansfield book as JOYCE reads a newspaper. \nJOYCE (looking up from the paper) Harvey, I've been reading about these kids who grew up in war zones... Palestinians, Israelis, El Salvadorians, Cambodians... These kids are amazing and they're -- \nA YUPPIE in a jogging suit walks up to Harvey, interrupting Joyce in mid-sentence. \nYUPPIE Hey, you're that guy from the Letterman show, right? \nHARVEY (smiling) Yeah, that's me. \nYUPPIE That's so excellent. You and Stupid Pet Tricks are a riot. \nHarvey's not smiling anymore. This guy's a jerk. \nHARVEY Yeah? Then why dontcha buy one of my comics, man. That's the only reason I go on that dumb show anyway. \nYUPPIE Right, sure. Later, Harvey Pekar! \nThe Yuppie rushes out. \nHARVEY Asshole. \nJOYCE Anyway, I want to do a political comic book about these kids. There's a conference in Jerusalem in a few weeks, and I can start by doing interviews there. \nHARVEY Whoa whoa, wait a second. Jerusalem? I can barely drag you off the futon to go to the Letterman show. \nJOYCE Y'know why? 'Cause I don't give a damn about the Letterman show. I want to work on something important to me. Something that matters. \nJoyce hits a nerve. \nHARVEY (furious) Hey! You know I only go on the show for the extra bread! \nPeople start to look over. \nJOYCE Harvey... you're yelling... \nHARVEY Maybe if you got yer lazy ass up and got a job, I could work on something that matters, too, huh?! \nJoyce doesn't dignify Harvey with an answer. She stares at him, her eyes well with hurt. \nHe sighs, calming down. He looks around sheepishly. \nHARVEY I'm sorry, baby. I -- I'm sorry... \nHe grabs her hand. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - DAY \nHarvey and Joyce stroll across the lawn holding hands. They move towards a waiting cab. Harvey carries his wife's bags. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) I guess it was good ta finally see Joyce excited about somethin' of her own. Sure I was happy for her. But I was still upset for me. \nThey stop by the cab. \nHARVEY This is crazy.

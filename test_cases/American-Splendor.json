{"train": "\"AMERICAN SPLENDOR\" \nby \nRobert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman \nPRODUCTION DRAFT \nFADE IN: \nINT. HARVEY\u0092S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nA BEDROOM MIRROR. \nThe room is dark. A perfectly square mirror hangs crooked on a wall. \nSuddenly, out of the darkness, the reflection of a man's face comes into focus. He stares straight ahead, perhaps studying his own unrecognizable reflection. It's quite clear this is a portrait of sickness; the man's pallor is gray, his eyes are confused. There is something most definitely wrong. \nTentatively, the figure steps away from the mirror, leaving the frame empty and dark. \nANGLE ON BED \nLike a ghost, the naked man (Harvey) stands over his bed staring down at his sleeping wife (Joyce). In the eerie light, he's almost translucent. \nHARVEY (faintly) Joyce... Joyce? \nJoyce springs up, alarmed. \nJOYCE What's wrong, Harvey? What are you doing up? \nHarvey just stands there for a moment saying nothing. \nJOYCE What is it? \nHARVEY (delirious, out of breath) Tell me the truth. Am I some guy who writes about himself in a comic book? Or am I just -- am I just a character in that book? \nJoyce rubs her eyes. \nJOYCE Harvey... \nHARVEY If I die, will 'dat character keep goin'? Or will he just fade away... \nJoyce just stares at him, unsure how to answer. Suddenly Harvey collapses. \nJoyce leaps from the bed, nervous, hysterical. She gets down on the floor and shakes him. \nJOYCE Omigod, Harvey! Harvey, wake up! \nCLOSE ON HARVEY'S FACE \nHis eyes remain closed, his expression far, far away. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nEXT. CLEVELAND ROW HOUSE - FALL - 1956 - DAY \nFADE UP ON: \nA surreal kaleidoscope of black, white and red. Similar to the mirror scene above, the colors slowly come into focus, revealing the chiseled features of a familiar face. But this time we see that it is not a real face, but rather a plastic mask of the D.C. Comic hero -- SUPERMAN. \nINTERTITLE: CLEVELAND OHIO, 1956 \nCLOSE ON SUPERMAN MASK \nIt glows eerily in the light of a porch lamp. A child's pupils glare through the eye holes... \nThe camera pans from SUPERMAN to the masked face of another caped-crusader: BATMAN. Batman turns toward his loyal sidekick ROBIN, who clutches a plastic, trick-or-treat pumpkin. \nNext, we find THE GREEN LANTERN as he reaches up to ring the doorbell. The camera finally rests on the last boy: an unkempt KID wearing no costume at all. Looking irritated and removed from the rest of the group, the KID shoves his hands in the pockets of his shearling coat. \nHe spits and rolls his eyes as a lady answers the door. \n--Buying used records from a garage sale table. \nINT. GREASY SPOON DINER - DAY \n--Eating junk food at a greasy spoon. \nINT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nHarvey fixes a rip in his coat with Elmer's Glue. \n(Note: Each \"Cartoon Harvey\" looks similar but unique... A variation on a theme. This is because his cartoons are drawn by different comic artists.) \nIntermittently, bold cartoon credits flash across the screen: \nFROM OFF THE STREETS OF CLEVELAND COMES... \nFollowed by the explosive title: \nAMERICAN SPLENDOR \nThe high-energy music and upbeat titles -- in direct contrast to the sulking image of Harvey -- continue through the remainder of the credits. \nEXT. CLEVELAND STREET OVERLOOKING FACTORIES - DAY \nWe're now on HARVEY'S back as he continues his forlorn journey. We move forward, past him, to peer over the hill at the factories below. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) Okay. We're throwing a lot at ya here, so lemme step in an' help ya catch up. This is the story about comic books, an' a guy who made a whole life outta them. You could even say comics saved his life. This guy here, he's our man, Harvey Pekar -- all grown up and goin' nowhere. Although he's a pretty scholarly cat, he never got much of a formal education. For the most part, he's lived in shit neighborhoods, held shit jobs, and is now knee deep into a second disastrous marriage. So if yer lookin' for romance or escapism or some fantasy figure to save the day, guess what? Ya got the wrong movie. \nSUDDENLY EVERYTHING -- THE MUSIC, THE CREDITS, THE IMAGES -- COMES TO A HALT. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SOUND STAGE - PRESENT - DAY \nHIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE \nThe REAL HARVEY PEKAR (not the actor who trudged through the credits) sits behind a microphone, supplying the \"voice over\" above. He clutches a movie script in his hand. \nThe frame is spare, with a few well-chosen items to indicate that he's in a recording session. \nAlthough he is significantly older than the man who portrays him, the \"Real Harvey\" is every bit as much of a sad sack... maybe even more. He is large and slightly threatening with knitted brows and wild eyes. Yet there is something kind and vulnerable about him -- a teddy bear who could kick your ass. Off Camera, WE HEAR the voices of the male and female directors (us -- BOB and SHARI) coaching the \"Real Harvey\" through his voice over. Harvey's irritable and contrary, saying that the whole Halloween incident never even happened. \n\"But I don't care man. I'm just doing this for the dough.\" We learn that Harvey is a reluctant participant in a film being made about his life. \nSUDDENLY, his third wife JOYCE BRABNER -- an intelligent control freak obsessed with all things negative -- joins in the conversation. Pushing back her huge glasses, she reprimands Harvey like he is an infant: \"Harvey you are talking too loud, Harvey you are being difficult.\" Harvey just rolls his eyes. Joyce gets offended. It is clear they have had this argument a million times. As Joyce storms off... \nHarvey explains that his wife is trying to take over the movie. He laments that she is his third wife, and he has no luck with women. \"Man, chicks just don't dig me.\" That's why he marries anyone who will have him. \"And I marry them fast before they get to know the real me...\" \nEND HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE \nCUT TO: \nINT. EXAMINATION ROOM - WINTER - 1975 - DAY \nINTERTITLE: 1975 \nHARVEY sits on a table in his T-shirt and underwear. A DOCTOR unwraps a tongue depressor. \nHarvey's voice is hoarse, raspy and barely audible. It sounds like it hurts for him to talk. Yet, he can't stop ranting. \nHARVEY Doc, you gotta help me. My old lady's dumping me 'cause I can't talk. She says I'm a social embarrassment. Now that she's got her PhD, she's some hot shit academic star an' I'm nuthin' but a file clerk with nothin' ta say an' no voice ta say it. But me bein' a file clerk was fine when I wrote the damn check for her tuition -- \nDOCTOR #1 Harvey, stop talking please, and open wide. \nHe points the tongue depressor at Harvey's mouth but he just keeps on going. \nHARVEY I just don't get it... We were doin' okay for a while. Then we took that stupid belated honeymoon. I started losin' my voice on the plane. Can you believe that... On the plane, doc? \nDOCTOR #1 Bad timing, I guess. Now please say \"Ah,\" Mr. Pekar. \nHARVEY \"Ahhh.\" (without missing a beat) \"Ahhh\" ruined the trip. I got crazy, started to worry my voice would never come back. I mean, my wife didn't know me so long before we got hitched. What if she totally forgets what I'm like? Man, it's torture -- \nOut of the corner of her eye, WOMAN #2 notices Harvey eavesdropping. \nWOMAN #2 (yelling at Harvey) Ay, what are you looking at? Maricone! \nStartled, Harvey moves on. \nEXT. ACROSS FROM A PARK - WINTER - 1975 - DAY \nHe passes a group of KIDS playing in the snow. They scream, yell and laugh with abandon. \nHARVEY (shaking his head) They all make it seem so easy. \nThen, BAM! Harvey is awakened from his reverie by a snowball. The kids laugh loudly. He wipes away the snow and walks on. \nA VOICE OVER interrupts the scene. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) Here's our man walking home from the doctor's. He's got the weight of the world on him. And fer what, really? 'Cause his throat's a little screwy? Man, people in India are starvin' to death every day. His problems are nothin'. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BRIDGE OVER TRAIN TRACKS - DAY \nTotally dejected, HARVEY crosses over train tracks on his way home. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) Still, he can't help feelin' paranoid, like some supernatural force is conspiring against him to rob him of his voice. \nEXT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - WINTER - 1975 - DAY \nHarvey sulks up the steps of his brick low-rise apartment building. He passes an ELDERLY NEIGHBOR coming down the walk with her shopping cart. Harvey unlocks the door. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) Maybe his old lady will go easy on him today, when she sees how upset he is. \nINT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - WINTER - 1975 - DAY \nHarvey's second wife LANA -- a hippyish chic with long hair and a bad attitude -- pulls books off a shelf and selectively throws them onto the floor or packs them into a milk crate. \nAn overstuffed suitcase sits beside her. She's obviously leaving him. HARVEY enters the room. \nHARVEY (whispering) Ay... What is this? \nHarvey's voice breaks up. \nLANA Exactly what it looks like. \nHARVEY (loud) Whattya mean!! You mean yer dumpin' me?! Fer what? (his voice really rips) Ah, shit! \nThat last yell did it. Harvey grabs throat in pain, torn between his throat discomfort and trying to stop his wife from leaving. \nLANA Look, your plebeian lifestyle isn't working for me anymore. Cleveland's not working for me anymore. I gotta get out of here before I kill myself. \nHARVEY But -- \nShe gathers her bags and heads for the door. Harvey trails her, trying to reason. \nHe opens his mouth, but nothing comes out. \nHARVEY (mouthing, just a wheeze) Please! Wait, honey... Just listen to what I got to say... \nShe turns and stares at him. Harvey tries to say something. \nBut now nothing at all comes out of his mouth. Only wheezes air. \nHe tries again. No sound at all. \nFinally LANA gives up, turns back towards the door and leaves. \nSLAM!! \nCUT TO: \nINT. V.A. HOSPITAL - 1975 - DAY \nHARVEY An' then on top of it I lost my voice for three months. I still sound like shit, but before I had nothin'. Man, talk about hell. I started forgettin' what I sound like, y'know? So I started writin' stuff down -- stories an' things, my points a' view, ideas. I even published a couple jazz record reviews. I guess that ended up bein' a good thing. \nCRUMB Uh-huh. \nHARVEY But don't think I buy into this \"growth\" crap. Everybody talks about how bad experiences can cause ya t'grow, an' all that clich\u00e9d stuff. I've had enough bad experiences and growth to last me plenty. (a beat) Right now, I'd be glad to trade some growth for happiness. \nFor a moment, they both just sit there saying nothing to each other, each man in his own private universe. \nFinally Harvey looks over to Crumb. \nHARVEY So how long are ya stayin' in Cleveland? \nCrumb never looks up from his picture. \nCRUMB I dunno, man. I gotta go visit this chick in New York. And I'm really busy with the comic book stuff. It's good bread and all man but I'm getting fed up with the whole scene. \nHARVEY What are ya talkin' about? Yer makin' a good living doin' yer art? Sheesh. How many guys get that lucky in their life, huh? \nCRUMB Yeah, I dunno. \nHARVEY Ya know man, people are startin' to know the name \"Crumb.\" When you croak you're gonna leave something behind. \nCRUMB Yeah, my ashes and some crappy doodles. It's not like I'm Blind Lemon Jefferson or Big Mama Thornton. \nHARVEY C'mon, man. It sure beats workin' a gig like mine -- being a nobody flunky and sellin' records on the side for a buck. \nCRUMB Yeah, well that's true... \nHarvey nods in agreement, mulling this over. He's not at all offended. \nCUT TO: \nINT. V.A. HOSPITAL - 1975 - DAY \nCLOSE ON A FILE DRAWER MARKED: \"RECENTLY DECEASED.\" \nA hand reaches into the frame and opens the drawer. \nBy rote, HARVEY fumbles with a large stack of \"expired patient\" files. He places each into the appropriate alphabetical \"deceased\" drawer. \nAttempting to grab another batch, Harvey accidentally knocks the entire pile onto the floor. \nHARVEY Damn it! \nHe crouches down to survey the mess -- a collage of \"expired lives\" laid out before his eyes. \nWe move past dozens of anonymous names -- William Anderson, Louis Collins, Mark D'Amico, Tyrone Moore, Franklin Ray, etc... Each file has a red \"Deceased\" stamp. \nDepressed, HARVEY is transfixed by the files surrounding him on the floor. Suddenly he stops and picks one up. \nANGLE ON FOLDER: It is marked, \"CHARLIE MARSHALL.\" \nHe opens the folder and reads the stats... \nBorn: 1920 in Cleveland Died: 1920 in Cleveland Occupation: Clerk \nANGLE ON HARVEY: He swallows hard as he reads about Charlie's small, invisible and now vanished life... He tosses the folder back onto the pile. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1975 - MORNING \nCLOSE ON: TWO STICK FIGURES IN AN EMPTY FRAME \nHARVEY sits at a table with a pen in hand and a blank sheet of paper in front of him. Nothing seems to come to him. \nHe flips through a pile of comic books -- everything from D.C. Comic Super Heroes to underground works such as Crumb's Mr. Natural and Zap Comix. No inspiration. Harvey throws them down in frustration. \nHARVEY I'm starvin'. \nCUT TO: \nIt is yet another grey day in Cleveland. The neighborhood is run-down. Garbage is strewn everywhere. \nThe following scene unfolds through the window: \nTwo UNSIGHTLY WORKERS lug an old, smelly mattress from a garage towards the garbage cans on the curb. Their conversation is distant, but entirely audible. \nMATTRESS GUY #1 So how smart is she? \nMATTRESS GUY #2 I dunno. I guess she's about average. \nMATTRESS GUY #1 Average? Hey, man. Average is dumb! \nThey drop the mattress in place. With the window framing these guys, the scene FREEZES, looking just like a comic book panel. \nINT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nHarvey turns around from the scene and ponders it. He moves back towards his pile of stick-figure drawings. \nCLOSE ON PAPER \nHarvey scribbles the words \"AMERICAN SPLENDOR\" at the top of the page. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CLEVELAND DINER - 1975 - DAY \nThe following scene is shot through the restaurant window. We see reflections of people walking by. \nA tense HARVEY starts at CRUMB as he eats a burger and reads Harvey's mock-ups. Harvey doesn't touch his burger deluxe and nervously talks in his laryngitis-afflicted voice. \nHARVEY See, ever since I read your stuff, man I've been thinking I could write comic book stories that were different from anything being done. \nCRUMB (munching on a fry) Uh-huh. \nHARVEY I'm thinkin', the guys who do animal comics and super-hero stuff are really limited 'cause they gotta try to appeal to kids. And underground comics like yours have been really subversive or opened things up politically. But there is still plenty more ta be done with 'em, too, y'know? \nCRUMB Pass me the ketchup? \nHARVEY I mean with pictures and words, it could be more of an art form. Like those French movies are. Or De Sica over in Italy, y'know?... So I tried writin' some things about real life. Stuff the everyman's gotta deal with. \nCrumb finally looks up from Harvey's work. \nCRUMB These are about you. \nHARVEY Er, yeah... \nCRUMB You turned yourself into a comic hero? \nHARVEY Sorta, yeah. But no idealized shit. No phony bullshit. The real thing, y'know? Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff. \nCrumb reads more. Harvey waits anxiously. Finally Crumb starts to chuckle. \nCRUMB These are really good, Harv. \nHARVEY (insecure) Really? Ya think so? \nCrumb shuffles through more. \nCRUMB Yeah. This is great stuff, man. I dig it. Can I take them home and illustrate them? \nHarvey is practically bursting. \nHARVEY Wow!! \nHarvey's voice breaks like a kid in puberty. He clears his throat. And something miraculous happens... \nWhen Harvey opens his mouth to speak his LARYNGITIS IS GONE! \nHARVEY You'd do that for me, man? That'd be great! I can't draw a straight line! \nCRUMB Hey, what's up with your voice, Harv? All of a sudden it sounds fine. \nANGLE ON SILENT GUY \nA SILENT GUY crouches by the wall, reading his CLEVELAND BROWNS trading cards. \nPAHLS Hey Harvey, if ya wanna make comics for adults, ya oughtta put some dirty stuff in it. \nGUY #3 Yeah, you can write about Marty's sex life. \nHarvey hangs with the guys but he doesn't engage. He seems to be observing them more than interacting with them. \nGUY #3 Right Marty? I heard ya went out with Bonnie yesterday. \nPAHLS Yeah. Howdja do? Wudja git offa her? \nMARTY Ah, lousy. All's I got wuz armaround. \nThe guys all stare at him for a moment. Then they crack up. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SOUND STAGE - PRESENT - DAY \nHIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE \nCLOSE UP: \nA COPY OF AMERICAN SPLENDOR #2: A FULL-COLOR CARTOON VERSION OF THE ABOVE SCENE GRACES THE COVER. \nA MARTY LOOK-ALIKE is bombarded with questions about his date with Bonnie. He complains that all he got was \"arm- around.\" The REAL HARVEY holds the above comic book in his hand. The stage is set with a few items that indicate a comic book store. HARVEY talks about a couple of \"American Splendor\" issues and how they impacted his life -- recognition as a writer, etc. He gives his philosophy about the comic book, etc. A MONTAGE OF AMERICAN SPLENDOR COVERS (ISSUE #3, #4, #5, #6, ETC.) THEY INDICATE A PASSAGE OF TIME... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HARVEY'S CUBICLE - V.A. HOSPITAL - 1980'S - DAY \nHARVEY sits alone in his cubicle. He doodles stick figures on a pad -- some ideas for a new comic. His posture's miserable. He rubs his temples like he's in anguish. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) Here's our man eight comics later, a brand new decade, same old bullshit. Yeah sure, he gets lots of recognition for his writin' now. Sure his comics are praised by all the important media types tellin' people what to think. But so what?  It's not like he makes a livin' at it like Bob Crumb. He can't go an' quit his day job or nothin'. \nJUMP CUT SEQUENCE \nSeveral shots of Harvey just thinking, scratching his face with a pencil, tapping his foot nervously. \nEach shot is separated by a second or two of black (an homage to Harvey's wordless panels). Finally, he goes back to writing. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) Who am I kiddin'. Truth is I'd be lost without my work routine. \nFLASH CUT TO: \nINT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - NIGHT \nAlone in bed, Harvey wakes up in a cold sweat from a nightmare. He looks horrified, short of breath. \nHARVEY (calming himself down) I got a job... I got a job... \nBACK TO: \nINT. HARVEY'S CUBICLE - V.A. HOSPITAL - 1980'S - DAY \nHARVEY scratches his head. \nCLOSE UP ON HIS DOODLING \nHarvey writes \"I got a job\" in a balloon over the stick figure's head. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) So -- to stave off desperation and feelings of uselessness -- I resigned myself to a menial existence. But hey, maybe the guy who's had a happy life feels worse just before he dies than th' guy who had a sad one. Or, maybe not. I dunno. Maybe I just needed a woman. \nToby comes in, decked out in plaid and stripes. He has an empty messenger bag. \nTOBY Hi, Harvey. Do you want these gourmet jelly beans? I gave up sweets for lent. \nHarvey turns around. He seems down, depressed. \nNaked and disheveled, HARVEY tosses and turns in bed. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) My loneliness was unbearable, man. Weekends were the worst. Sometimes in my sleep, I'd feel a body next to me like an amputee feels a phantom limb. \nEXT. PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE -- DAY \nExtreme wide shot: a city-street overpass spans across the entire frame. The lone figure of Harvey sulks there in the middle, watching traffic pass below. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) Sure my comics were bringin' me notoriety, but my personal life was in shambles. I thought a little attention would make me feel better. It only made me feel worse. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BAKERY SIDE STREET - SPRING - 1980'S - MORNING \nIt is a beautiful, sunny day. The trees are in bloom. \nThere's the first scent of spring in the air. Kids play in the street. Music pours out of passing cars. Everyone seems to have a smile on his or her face except HARVEY. He walks on the shadowy side of the street. \nEXT. BAKERY STREET - SPRING \nEstablishing shot of HARVEY trudging into the bakery. \nINT. BAKERY - SPRING - 1980'S - MORNING \nA couple of WOMEN order bread and cookies from TWO COUNTER GIRLS. \nHARVEY surveys the donuts. \nCOUNTER GIRL #1 (yelling to Harvey) Next! \nHARVEY (to the Counter Girl) Yeah! I'll have two crullers, a jelly donut with powdered sugar... And you got any \"day old bread\"? \nA woman with attractive Irish looks brushes past Harvey on her way to the door. This is ALICE QUINN, roughly Harvey's age but there is a tired, weary look in her eyes. \nALICE Hey, you're Harvey Pekar. \nHalf in a daze, Harvey stares at the chick. \nHARVEY Yeah... \nALICE Alice Quinn. From school. \nHarvey studies her face. Suddenly, it clicks. \nHARVEY Oh yeah. College. We had a couple lit classes together. \nHarvey pays and receives his items. They step back towards the door. \nALICE What happened to you? You just disappeared after one semester. \nHarvey scratches his armpit. \nHARVEY I know, man. I got good grades and all but there was this required math class. I can't do math, an' that required class hangin' over my head made me crazy. Eventually the pressure got to be too much. \nALICE Well, you're doing okay anyway. I heard all about your jazz reviews and your comics. \nThis perks Harvey up. \nHARVEY Ya did? \nALICE Sure, you're famous. Meanwhile I got my degree but I'm just a plain old wife and mother. \nHarvey stares at her wedding ring. His face drops. \nHARVEY Yeah. I'm not doing as great as ya think. My second wife divorced me and I work at a dead end job as a file clerk. Sometimes I hang out with the guys on the corner but most of the time I just stay home by myself and read. \nAlice laughs. \nALICE You're luckier than you think. My husband and kids make it impossible for me to cuddle up with a good book. \nCUT TO: \nJOYCE BRABNER, a depressive nudge with a perpetually peptic expression frantically searches the store for something. Her partner, a granola type named RAND, finishes unloading a stack on the shelf. \nJOYCE What happened to the new American Splendor? \nRAND We sold 'em, babe. \nJOYCE All of them? \nRAND Yep. \nJOYCE (accusatory) Damn it! I put one aside for myself, next to the register. I didn't even get a chance to read it. \nRAND Whoa, sorry, Joyce. I didn't know you were such a Splendor fan. Next time take it home. \nJoyce leans against the counter. She pushes up her glasses and looks really upset. \nJOYCE Maybe I'll call the publisher. But they take so damn long. Shit! Why does everything in my life have to be such a complicated disaster... \nJoyce starts slamming things around the store. Finally Rand grabs his stuff. \nRAND Okay, I'm gonna hustle before the vibe in here gets any worse. \nRand leaves. Joyce barely notices, still brewing. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JOYCE'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - NIGHT \nThe mess in this room rivals Harvey's. A few cats add to the clutter. Joyce lies on her disheveled bed and writes a letter. \nJOYCE (V.O.) Greetings from the second smallest state in the union, an endless plastics and nylon plantation controlled by giant chemical corporations. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - VESTIBULE - 1980'S - DAY \nHARVEY takes his mail out of the box. He finds an oddly decorated envelope. \nJOYCE (V.O.) To make matters more dismal, there are no decent comic book stores in my town, which is why my partner and I opened one ourselves. \nINT. HARVEY'S BATHROOM - 1980'S - DAY \nHARVEY finishes reading the letter sitting on the toilet. A cat runs around him. \nJOYCE (V.O.) Despite our steadily faltering business, my partner managed to sell the last copy of American Splendor #8 out from under me. I'm a big fan and I hate to wait for a new order. Is there any way I can get it from you direct? Sincerely, Joyce Brabner. \nHarvey scratches his head. He mutters to himself. \nHARVEY ...man, she's got good lookin' handwritin'... \nINT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - NIGHT \nBEGIN MONTAGE -- HARVEY AND JOYCE COMMUNICATING \nWe see Harvey in his bed writing. \nHARVEY Dear Joyce, Thanks for the letter. Whattya do besides sellin' comics? \nTHE SCREEN SPLITS TO ACCOMMODATE: \nINT. DELAWARE PRISON CLASSROOM - 1980'S - DAY \nWe see Joyce standing in front of a GROUP OF PRISONERS. \nJOYCE (V.O.) I'm a sometime activist and I teach writing to prisoners. I try to help them build an interior life and make art out of their monotonous, suffocating routine. \nTHE SCREEN GIVES WAY TO ANOTHER FRAME \nINT. BUS - 1980'S - DAY \nHarvey scribbles a letter while riding on the bus. \nJoyce lets go of his hand. She stares at him in disbelief. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TGIF STYLE RESTAURANT - 1980'S - NIGHT \nThe most awkward date in history. Seated in an ultra-yuppie restaurant filled with business lunchers, Harvey and Joyce hide behind their menus. While everyone else looks slick and successful, these two compete for the world's worst posture. \nHARVEY What's wrong? \nJOYCE Nothing. \nHARVEY Somethin's wrong. Yer lookin' around everywhere. \nJOYCE I guess I never imagined you eating in a place like this. \nHARVEY Me? I never been here. I thought you'd like it. But obviously ya don't, do ya? \nJOYCE It's fine. What difference does it make? \nHarvey shakes his head, feeling more pessimistic. \nHARVEY I dunno. None, I guess. (beat) They sure got a lot of meat on this menu. \nJOYCE You're a vegetarian? \nHARVEY Kinda. I mean ever since I got a pet cat, I couldn't eat animals anymore. \nJoyce grabs a bread stick. \nJOYCE Hmm. I support and identify with groups like PETA, but unfortunately I'm a self-diagnosed anemic. Also, I have all these food allergies to vegetables that give me serious intestinal distress. I guess I have a lot of borderline health disorders that limit me politically when it comes to eating. \nHarvey just stares at her. \nHARVEY Wow. Yer a sick woman, huh? \nJOYCE Not yet. But I expect to be. Everyone in my family's got some kind of degenerative illness. \nA cheery waitress bounces over. \nWAITRESS (sing song) Good afternoon! I'm your server Cindy! What can I bring you two today? \nThey slowly look up at her. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - NIGHT \nJOYCE and HARVEY enter the apartment. The place is a mess, as usual. \nHARVEY Look, I was gonna clean up, but why should I give you any false notions? The truth is I got a serious problem with cleanliness. I could wash a dish ten times and it'd still dirty. They even kicked me outta the Army 'cause I couldn't learn ta make a bed. \nJoyce puts down her bag. \nJOYCE I've seen worse. \nShe slumps down on the sofa as if she's been here a million times. She rubs her head. Harvey sits next to her. \nJOYCE Harvey, go get me water and a few aspirin. \nHarvey just bounces back up and obeys. \nHARVEY What, ya got a headache? \nJOYCE No, but I want to avoid one. \nHarvey empties the aspirin bottle in his palm. For some reason, he's feeling more comfortable. \nHARVEY Well lemme tell ya Joyce, it sure is nice ta have company. I mean, despite all your problems, you seem like a great person. An' hey, sorry if my dating skills are kinda rusty, but I've just been through hell and back with women. I mean that last one turned out to be a real nasty bitch. \nHarvey arrives back with the aspirin. He hands it to Joyce. \nHarvey stands there waiting. \nHARVEY The girl at the Food Co-op picked me out all kinds of herbal stuff. One of 'ems good for stomachaches. Grandma Bear's Tummy Mint, I think. Are you still there? \nJoyce slowly opens the door. She leans against the door frame like she's just been through a war. \nShe takes off her glasses and cleans them off with her shirt. \nJOYCE Harvey, we better skip this whole courtship thing and just get married. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - DAY \nHarvey and Joyce are in bed, lying in each other's arms. \nThey look quite contented. \nHARVEY Man, am I glad I talked you into comin' up here. Any more time alone and I mighta lost it fer good. \nJOYCE Me too. \nHARVEY So you don't have any problems with movin' to Cleveland? \nJOYCE Not really. I find most American cities depressing in the same way. \nHARVEY An' yer okay with the vasectomy thing? \nShe shrugs. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - V.A. HOSPITAL - 1980'S - DAY \nHARVEY approaches the building. Instead of dragging his feet like usual, he seems to be floating on a cloud. We haven't seen Harvey this happy since... well, since never. \nHe stops by a junker car and peeks in the window, finding TOBY eating lunch alone. He has an entire White Castle smorgasbord spread across the front seat. \nHarvey knocks on the window. Toby rolls it down. \nHARVEY Ay Toby. \nTOBY (mouth full) No you can't have any of my White Castle hamburgers so please don't even ask. \nHARVEY Can I have a fry? \nHarvey reaches for a handful of Toby's fries. \nTOBY Okay, but just a couple, Harvey. I'm not going to eat dinner until very late and this has got to hold me over. \nHarvey leans in, always amused by Toby. He steals another fry. \nHARVEY (munching) Whattya got, a church function? \nTOBY No, I'm driving to Toledo to see a movie. Would you like to come? \nHARVEY Nah. I gotta fly to Delaware tonight. I'm gettin' married. \nTOBY Oh. Why Delaware? \nHARVEY The chick I'm marryin' is from Wilmington. Plus, I gotta help her move her stuff here. (a beat) Why you drivin' ta Toledo to see a movie? \nTOBY It's not playing at the Mapletown. (a beat) I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Harvey. \nHARVEY Yeah. We met last week. \nHarvey opens the car door and slides in with Toby. \nHARVEY Toby, what movie could possibly be worth drivin' 260 miles round trip for? \nTOBY It's a new film called \"Revenge of the Nerds.\" It's about a group of nerd college students who are being picked on all the time by the jocks, so they decide to take revenge. I already saw it once. \nHARVEY Wow, ya really dig this movie. \nToby and Joyce continue to analyze the movie in the front seat as Toby starts the ignition. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TOBY'S CAR \nANGLE ON HARVEY IN BACK SEAT \nSlouched, grumpy and alone on the back seat, Harvey's still annoyed by the movie. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) Okay, maybe I was bein' so harsh on Toby onna count a' my own problems. \nREAL HARVEY Y'see, I wasn't even married a month and my old lady was already showin' signs a' trouble. Granted, I tend ta get married fast 'cause I'll take any woman that'll have me, but this time I really met my match... \nCUT TO: \nINT. REHEARSAL STUDIO - PRESENT - DAY \nHIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE \nA few items indicating film production are in the frame. \nAt a table in the foreground, BOB THE DIRECTOR discusses the character of Joyce with the ACTRESS playing her. The actress just nods as the director goes on. \nWe can see THE REAL JOYCE sitting with THE REAL HARVEY in the distance. \nDIRECTOR Okay, I think the thing with Joyce is that as manic as Harvey can be, she matches him with depression. In that way they complete each other. I mean, she's obviously a very smart woman, but she has a lot of trouble functioning in a world she can't control. And she's totally obsessed with all things negative; y'know, diseases, dysfuctions, etc. \nTHE REAL JOYCE and REAL HARVEY listen curiously -- sometimes pleased, sometimes displeased -- as their personalities are dissected and boiled down to a few phrases. \nCLOSER SHOT OF REAL JOYCE AND HARVEY \nThe REAL JOYCE puts in her two cents about the actress playing her. She rants about what it's like to be portrayed in a movie, and having a character arc imposed on her life. \nShe moves into talking about her relationship with Harvey, and the first years of their marriage -- how impossible it was to live with him. \nThe REAL HARVEY just rolls his eyes. \nEND HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE \nCUT TO: \nINT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY \nJOYCE is on a cleaning rampage. She rummages through piles upon piles of records while HARVEY paces nervously. \nJOYCE What about these 78's, Harvey? Can't you sell them to one of those collectors? \nHARVEY Are ya kidding? No way, man. I ain't getting rid of my 78's. \nJoyce throws down the records in frustration. Harvey runs over to check if they're scratched. \nJOYCE (angry) Forget it then. I give up! How can I make more storage space, if you won't get rid of anything? \nHARVEY I'll get rid of stuff. Just not my good stuff. \nJOYCE Everything's your good stuff. How am I supposed to live here, if there's no room for me? \nHARVEY Aw come on, baby. I'll make room for ya. You just have to give me time. I'm not so good at these kind of things. \nJOYCE That's because you're obsessive compulsive Harvey. \nA DOOR BUZZER rings. Harvey slams it to unlock the front. \nHARVEY C'mon. I don't wanna hear that psychobabble crap! \nJOYCE I don't care if you wanna hear it or not. You're the poster child for the DSM III. I'll have you know that I come from a very dysfunctional family. I can spot personality disorders a mile away... \nA KNOCK ON THE DOOR interrupts their argument. Joyce storms away to answer it. \nANGLE ON THE DOOR: \nHARVEY tries on outfits for the big show. He pulls a wrinkled T-shirt over his head and models it for JOYCE who is spread out on the bed surrounded by piles of clothing, scissors and sewing supplies. She glances up at Harvey's getup and shakes her head no. \nHARVEY Aw, c'mon. Who the hell cares? \nHarvey tosses his shirt over to Joyce, who snatches it and starts cutting it with a scissor. \nHARVEY Hey, whattya doin? \nJOYCE Merchandising. \nShe resumes her mysterious sewing project; she seems to be making some kind of doll. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY \nBackstage, JOYCE watches LATE NIGHT WITH DAVID LETTERMAN on a monitor as HARVEY awaits his turn to go on camera. He has changed out of his wrinkled T-shirt into a slightly more formal look -- a denim shirt and a ratty seersucker striped jacket. \nLETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE \nANGLE ON MONITOR (NOTE: THIS IS ACTUAL STOCK FOOTAGE OF THE SHOW) \nA 1980's DAVID LETTERMAN wisecracks. \nINT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY \nNeither Joyce nor Harvey look particularly impressed with the whole deal. \nJOYCE People like this show? \nHarvey paces. \nHARVEY I'm gettin' hungry back here. They oughtta leave ya donuts or somethin'. \nA nervous STAGE MANAGER wearing a headset peeks his head in. \nSTAGE MANAGER Dave's ready for you now, Mr. Pekar. \nHARVEY Hey, you got anything ta eat? My stomach's growling. \nSTAGE MANAGER (checking his watch) There's no time to eat now. \nHarvey glances at the monitor just as Letterman announces his next guest. \nLETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE \nLETTERMAN Okay. Our next guest works as a file clerk in a Cleveland hospital. \nINT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY \nThe stage manager grabs Harvey by the arm. Joyce stops them. \nJOYCE Wait a minute. Where's the doll? \nHARVEY He's got it at the desk. Will you relax about that already? \nSTAGE MANAGER Guys, guys, we're in a hurry here. \nThe Stage Manager physically pushes Harvey out of the Green Room. Joyce turns back to face the monitor. \nLETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE \nANGLE ON MONITOR \nLetterman holds up a copy of a full-size glossy AMERICAN SPLENDOR ANTHOLOGY. \nLETTERMAN ...He also writes comic books which detail his day-to-day pains and pleasures, and this is an anthology of nine of those comics. It's entitled AMERICAN SPLENDOR... From off the streets of Cleveland, please say hello to Harvey Pekar. \nTHE HARVEY PEKAR WHO WALKS ONTO THE SET IS NOT THE ACTOR PORTRAYING HIM BUT RATHER THE REAL HARVEY PEKAR (only about 15 years younger). THIS IS ACTUAL STOCK FOOTAGE FROM HARVEY'S FIRST LETTERMAN APPEARANCE. \nINT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - DAY \nThe Audience can't believe this guy's holding his own with Letterman. \nINT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY \nANGLE ON LETTERMAN REGULAR \nLETTERMAN REGULAR (to Joyce) At least he's keeping up with Letterman. \nJOYCE Pandering is more like it. \nSuddenly, Joyce walks over to the monitor and looks for the channel. She hits a button, but it only changes the frame of the show. \nJOYCE Damnit. \nLETTERMAN REGULAR Excuse me, but what are you doing? \nJOYCE I'm trying to get some news. You know there's a big story about to break about the US selling arms to Iran and the Contras. \nLETTERMAN REGULAR That's a monitor. \nJOYCE Ugh. Just forget it. \nJoyce gives up. She sinks back into her seat and pulls a book from her bag. The Letterman Regular stares at her like she's from Mars. \nLETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE \nANGLE ON THE MONITOR \nLETTERMAN Harvey, I know you've got a job. I've got a job. We're both very lucky. We both have jobs. \nHARVEY Then what's the matter? \nOnce again laughs and a big round of applause. Letterman pulls out Joyce's mysterious doll and props it up on the table. \nLETTERMAN We've gotta go. Harvey I like you. I'm on your side. I enjoy the comic books. And here, quickly tell us about the little doll here. \nHARVEY My wife made it. \nINT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY \nBACK TO JOYCE. \nShe suddenly perks up. \nJOYCE Finally something good. (to Letterman Regular) Watch this. \nLETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE CLOSE-UP OF THE DOLL \nIt is an absolutely horrific but oddly evocative \"Harvey Rag Doll.\" His face is inspired by Crumb's drawings of Harvey but even more extreme. His little T-shirt reads, \"American Splendor.\" The Audience is in stitches. \nLETTERMAN They're made out of your old clothing. \nHARVEY That's right. \nLETTERMAN And what do these go for? \nHARVEY Thirty-four bucks. \nLETTERMAN (shocked) Thirty-four dollars? Thirty-four dollars for this? \nHARVEY What are ya cheap. You cheaper than me? \nLETTERMAN Would you pay thirty-four dollars for that? \nHARVEY No but I'm not asking it. My wife is. \nBACK TO: \nINT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY \nJOYCE stares at the monitor, expressionless. The STAGE MANAGER sticks his head in. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) That day on the set with those MTV jerks, I had an epiphany. It seemed that real, salt of the earth people like Toby an' me were bein' coopted by these huge corporations. We were gettin' held up and ridiculed as losers in the system.  What can I say, it was the 80's man. \nCUT TO: \nMTV PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT \nTOBY, dressed in dark sunglasses and a turtleneck, stands in front of a White Castle. He delivers his lines in his trademark robotic style. There's an MTV logo on the bottom of the screen. \nTOBY Hamburgers are a safer addiction than drugs. Say no to drugs. Say yes to White Castle! \nCUT TO: \nINT. CLEVELAND DINER - 1980'S - DAY \nHARVEY and JOYCE eat breakfast together. Harvey reads a Katherine Mansfield book as JOYCE reads a newspaper. \nJOYCE (looking up from the paper) Harvey, I've been reading about these kids who grew up in war zones... Palestinians, Israelis, El Salvadorians, Cambodians... These kids are amazing and they're -- \nA YUPPIE in a jogging suit walks up to Harvey, interrupting Joyce in mid-sentence. \nYUPPIE Hey, you're that guy from the Letterman show, right? \nHARVEY (smiling) Yeah, that's me. \nYUPPIE That's so excellent. You and Stupid Pet Tricks are a riot. \nHarvey's not smiling anymore. This guy's a jerk. \nHARVEY Yeah? Then why dontcha buy one of my comics, man. That's the only reason I go on that dumb show anyway. \nYUPPIE Right, sure. Later, Harvey Pekar! \nThe Yuppie rushes out. \nHARVEY Asshole. \nJOYCE Anyway, I want to do a political comic book about these kids. There's a conference in Jerusalem in a few weeks, and I can start by doing interviews there. \nHARVEY Whoa whoa, wait a second. Jerusalem? I can barely drag you off the futon to go to the Letterman show. \nJOYCE Y'know why? 'Cause I don't give a damn about the Letterman show. I want to work on something important to me. Something that matters. \nJoyce hits a nerve. \nHARVEY (furious) Hey! You know I only go on the show for the extra bread! \nPeople start to look over. \nJOYCE Harvey... you're yelling... \nHARVEY Maybe if you got yer lazy ass up and got a job, I could work on something that matters, too, huh?! \nJoyce doesn't dignify Harvey with an answer. She stares at him, her eyes well with hurt. \nHe sighs, calming down. He looks around sheepishly. \nHARVEY I'm sorry, baby. I -- I'm sorry... \nHe grabs her hand. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - DAY \nHarvey and Joyce stroll across the lawn holding hands. They move towards a waiting cab. Harvey carries his wife's bags. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) I guess it was good ta finally see Joyce excited about somethin' of her own. Sure I was happy for her. But I was still upset for me. \nThey stop by the cab. \nHARVEY This is crazy. Can't ya just do somethin' here in Cleveland? \nHARVEY (threatening) Okay, asshole. You'll pay for that one... \nHarvey takes off his shirt. He pulls another t-shirt out of the bag and changes ... \nLETTERMAN REGULAR (O.S.) Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back, Harvey Pekar. \nHarvey's new t-shirt reads \"ON STRIKE AGAINST NBC.\" He takes off for the stage, fists clenched, a soldier marching off to war. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY \nWe're positioned behind the monitor, so we can only hear the show. THE STAGE MANAGER AND TWO PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS straighten up in the room. \nHARVEY (O.S.) Hey, Dave! You wanna know what my politics are? I'm a strident leftist, Dave. \nLETTERMAN (O.S.) I could have guessed half of that. \nHARVEY (O.S.) You coulda guessed all of it, man! So why don't we talk about your parent company, G.E., huh? Let's talk about anti-trust violations and nuclear reactors! \nSTAGE MANAGER Joe, put more sodas in the fridge, there. And let's clean up the counters. That Pekar guy's a pig. \nAs the P.A.'s walk back and forth in front of the monitor, we hear the Letterman / Pekar banter grow louder. \nSuddenly PRODUCTION ASSISTANT #2 stops and checks out the monitor. \nPRODUCTION ASSISTANT #2 Whoa... you guys. Check this out. \nINT. TOBY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY \nTOBY and his GRANDMOTHER watch HARVEY raise hell on Letterman. Again, we can't see the screen. \nHARVEY (O.S.) You're a cop-out, Letterman. You're nothin' but a shill for G.E. \nToby's grandmother passes him a plate of cookies. \nLETTERMAN (O.S.) First of all, Harvey, what you are saying is not true. Second of all, this is not the place to say it. If you want to talk about this, go somewhere else, because you're not talking about it here!! \nCUT TO: \nINT. MR. BOAT'S KITCHEN - 1980'S - DAY \nDressed in a bathrobe, Mr. Boats eats a lonely, late-night snack (cake and milk) at his kitchen table. A 12\" TV on the table has Harvey and Dave on. \nHARVEY (O.S.) Don't worry, Dave. I won't come back unless you beg me. \nLETTERMAN (O.S.) You're not coming back at all. \nHARVEY (O.S.) What do I care -- \nLETTERMAN (O.S.) Because we've given you many, many chances to talk about things that would be of general interest to people -- \nHARVEY (O.S.) So what?! \nMr. Boats shakes his head. \nINT. TOWN CAR - 1980'S - DAY \nWe see Harvey alone, slumped in the back seat of a Town Car, heading back towards his hotel. City lights pass over his troubled face. We still hear the show, as if it's now in his head. \nLETTERMAN (V.O.) -- And also to promote your little Mickey Mouse magazine. Your little weekly reader! But you've blown every chance you've got. You're a dork, Harvey! \nHARVEY (V.O.) Dave, you're fulla shit! You're fulla shit!! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.

HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - DAY \nHARVEY and JOYCE lay there quietly, both exhausted. Joyce turns over so her back faces Harvey. He puts his arm around her. \nANGLE ON JOYCE'S FACE \nA tear drips down her cheek. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - DAY \nJoyce is straightening up the apartment. The place actually looks halfway decent. \nTHE DOORBELL RINGS \nJoyce opens the door. A guy in his 30's named FRED -- Hells Angels tough guy meets sensitive artist -- stands at the door. He's accompanied by a seven-year-old girl, DANIELLE. \nFRED Hey, I'm Fred. You called me about the comic book? \nJOYCE Right -- the artist. Come on in. \nFRED This is my daughter, Danielle. I had to bring her along. I hope you don't mind. \nJoyce leans down and addresses the girl, who holds a toy horse. \nJOYCE Hi, Danielle. What's that you're holding? \nDANIELLE A pony. \nIt's immediately obvious that Joyce is great with kids. \nJOYCE A pony? What's his name? \nDANIELLE She's a girl. Clarissa. \nJOYCE Oh, I see. Well, I'm Joyce. Nice to meet both you and Clarissa. \nThey all walk towards the table which is covered with papers. \nFRED I'm really sorry to hear about Harvey. Is he here? \nJOYCE He's going to work until next week, when he starts the chemo. That's why I wanna get this project started now. Once he's stuck here, I know he'll take over. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - LATER \nMiserable and in a daze, HARVEY walks up to his front door. \nHe looks like a man whose days are numbered. When he reaches the door, he searches his pockets for keys. \nANGLE ON POCKET \nHarvey's hand comes up empty. \nHARVEY Shit! \nHarvey tries the doorknob, but it's locked. \nHe steps back on the lawn and looks around. Could he have dropped them? He retraces a few steps. \nHARVEY Damnit! \nHarvey yells up at the window. \nBACK TO MORE COMIC PANELS: \n1) An enraged Harvey throws things around the house. \n2) Joyce on the bed crying, a cat licking her back. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

The balloon above his head reveals his inner turmoil over losing his hair and his face swelling. \nMORE COMIC PANELS FOLLOW \nHarvey in agony.

HARVEY'S KITCHEN - 1980'S - DAY \nJoyce and Fred go over some more comic art. Joyce carries the idea over to Harvey (wearing a baseball cap), who can't get out of the couch.

Directly in front of Harvey are boxes of used records. \nHARVEY shows us his prodigious record collection. Thousands of LP's -- rare jazz, blues, fusion, klezmer, etc. -- are piled in floor-to-ceiling bookcases. \nHe tells us about his love of jazz and how he started writing jazz reviews and music articles. He finds the first record that he reviewed and puts it on his turntable. As the music plays... \nHarvey talks about how he started buying and selling records.

In the early sixties I was with some buddies at a junk sale looking for some choice sides when I met this shy, retiring cat from Philadelphia named Bob Crumb. You know the guy; Fritz the Cat, Mr. Natural an' all -- they made a movie about him, too. \nOne of Harvey's pals -- MARTY -- pulls a record out of a box. \nMARTY C'mon, Harv. You dig Jay McShann. You gonna buy that or what? \nHarvey jumps up from his search to check out the LP. \nHARVEY I don't know, Marty. It's got a lamination crack in it... (checking out the price) A quarter. Maybe I can get him down. \nMARTY You are one cheap bastard Harvey. \nHARVEY Yeah, I know I'm tight, man, but I live on a government wage. \nA skinny guy with a big nose, glasses and a ratty trench coat taps Harvey on the shoulder. He is soft-spoken, a bit shy and very odd -- a young ROBERT CRUMB. \nCRUMB You collect Jay McShann, man? \nHARVEY Yeah, man. How 'bout you? \nCRUMB Yeah but most of my records are back in Philly. \nA greaser-type guy in a leather jacket, PAHLS, joins them. \nPAHLS Harv, meet my buddy Bob Crumb. He just moved to town. He's an artist at American Greeting Card Company. \nHARVEY That's cool. \nPAHLS You should see his comics, Harv. They are outta sight. \nHARVEY (interested) Yeah?

Records and books are strewn everywhere. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) So Crumb showed me this comic book novel he was working on -- THE BIG YUM YUM BOOK. I'd never seen anything like it. \nHARVEY marches back and forth holding Crumb's illustrated comic novel. CRUMB sits on the floor nursing a beer and sorting through vintage comic books. Harvey's bursting with so much enthusiasm, it's almost aggressive. \nHARVEY It's terrific, man! I really dig your work. \nCrumb ignores Harvey's praise. \nCRUMB (holding up a vintage comic) This PETER WHEAT book is by Walt Kelly... It's pretty rare. \nHARVEY Yeah? Can I get good bread for it? \n", "test1_true": "Harvey flops down in an overstuffed chair. Stuffing flies out. He sips his beer. \nHARVEY Listen man, let's get back to your book. What are you gonna do with it? \nCRUMB (looking up) I hadn't thought about it. It's just an exercise. \nHarvey flips through the book. \nHARVEY It's more than an exercise. It's breaking ground, man.

HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - FALL - 1962 - LATER \nCRUMB lies on the couch sketching while HARVEY reads more of THE YUM YUM BOOK. A scratchy jazz record plays. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) Crumb and I hung out a lot back then. We had records and comics in common. \nANGLE ON CRUMB'S DRAWING \nWe see Crumb is actually sketching Harvey, slumped in a chair reading a book. Crumb makes Harvey look like a smelly, sweaty madman with ratty clothing. \nCrumb holds the sketch of Harvey up to show him. \nCRUMB (laughing) Check it out, man. Pretty scary. \nHarvey glances up at his portrait, completely unselfconscious. \nHARVEY Yeah, ya don't know the half of it. \nHarvey goes back to reading. Crumb back to sketching. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) Eventually people got hip to Crumb's art work and he started hangin' out with a Bohemian crowd. After a while, he got sick of greeting cards and moved away to San Francisco where he got the whole underground comic scene off the ground. \nCrumb slowly evaporates from the room, leaving Harvey totally alone. \nANGLE ON 45 RECORD SPINNING AND SPINNING \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.)

He pulls at his hair, and looks as though he may murder the next person who walks by. \nINTERTITLE: BACK TO 1975 \nAs the pencil adds shading to Harvey's face, WE HEAR: \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) Once he came to visit when I was really feelin' bad. It was right around the time of my throat operation, an' right after my second wife left me. At first it was pretty weird. I mean, here my life was falling apart an' everything was going great for him. I was on my second divorce an' he was a big hit with the chicks. I was a nothin' file clerk and he was this famous cartoonist. \nHARVEY and R. CRUMB sit on a park bench together by a bus stop. A distraught Harvey whines while Crumb just sketches. \nHarvey's voice is still raspy. \nHARVEY I dunno, man. On the one hand most women gettin' graduate degrees wouldn't give a guy like me the time a' day. An' she married me an' everything, so I gotta give her some kinda credit. But then she got so mean to me in the end. An' it ain't like I tried t'keep her captive or anything like that, y'know? \nCrumb may or may not be listening to Harvey. It's hard to tell. \n", "test2_input": "HARVEY and JOYCE walk through the terminal. Harvey brims with energy but Joyce looks exhausted. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) If ya think readin' comics about yer life seems strange, try watchin' a play about it. God only knows how I'll feel when I see this movie. But truth be told, the play wasn't half bad, and we got a free trip outta it. Things were goin' pretty good for a change. Variety called me \"The Blue Collar Mark Twain,\" and Doubleday was interested in publishing an anthology of \"American Splendor.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. AIRPORT - BAGGAGE CLAIM - 1980'S - DAY \nHarvey nervously taps his foot as he waits for the bags. \nJoyce leans against the carousel staring at a YOUNG MOTHER with a BABY in a Bjorn. \nHARVEY I hate checkin' bags, man. It always takes forever. \nHe checks his watch. Joyce remains quiet and distant. \nHARVEY Jesus, look at the time. The bus is gonna leave soon and there won't be another one for an hour. That means I gotta shell out an extra thirty bucks for a cab. \nHarvey spots a bag that he thinks is his. \nHARVEY Hey wait, there's our -- (a well-dressed man grabs it) Figures. That lucky Yuppie's gonna get on the bus in time. \nSuddenly, Joyce mumbles something to Harvey. \nJOYCE Y'know Harvey, vasectomies are reversible. \nHARVEY (ignoring her) Damn Yuppies get everything. \nJOYCE (raising her voice) Are you listening to me? I said vasectomies are reversible. \nHeads turn. \nHARVEY What? Whattya talkin' about? I don't want kids. An' I came clean about my vasectomy the first time I set eyes on ya', right here in this airport. \nMore heads turn. \nJOYCE I know but things have changed. I think we can be a family. \nHARVEY Family?! What kinda family could we possibly be? I ain't no good with kids. I can barely take care of myself. \nJOYCE I'll take care of the kid and you. \nHARVEY (dead serious) No way Joyce. Forget it. I can't do it; I can't have no kids. \nJoyce folds her arms... dejected, defeated. The audience of eavesdroppers looks disappointed as well. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY \nIf the place was a disaster before, believe it or not, it's gotten worse. JOYCE seems to have given up on her organizing... and everything else for that matter. \nHARVEY hysterically searches through the mess for a record album. Joyce just lies listlessly on an open futon on the middle of the room; it looks as if she hasn't been up in days. \nHARVEY Where the hell is that Ornette Coleman album, Joyce? I got a review due tomorrow. \nJoyce rolls over. \nJOYCE I didn't touch it, Harvey. Would you let me sleep? \nHARVEY But it's one o'clock! How late can a person sleep? \nJoyce sits up. This time she means business. \nJOYCE It happens to be Saturday you selfish sonofabitch! And don't you go telling me what to do. I'm the one who moved into your city, into your home, into your vasectomy and into your screwed- up life. The least you could do is allow me to live here my way. \nShe rolls over and covers her head with the pillow. Harvey just stands there staring at her. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUPERMARKET - 1980'S - DAY \n", "test2_true": "HARVEY peruses the aisles. He pulls box upon box of herbal tea off the shelves. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) I mean she wouldn't get a job, wouldn't go out, wouldn't make friends, nothin'. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY \nHARVEY throws boxes of herbal teas at JOYCE as she sprawls listlessly on the futon. She just yawns and turns over on her side. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) Joyce diagnosed herself as \"clinically depressed.\" I don't know what the hell she was goin' through but it was sure takin' it's toll on me. \nA frustrated Harvey tries once more to cheer her up. \nHARVEY (upbeat) We can go out for dinner tonight. How 'bout catching a bite at Tommy's? \nJOYCE (mumbling) I'm not hungry. \nHarvey throws his hands in the air and walks off. \nHARVEY I give up. \nAs he passes the answering machine, he notices it's blinking. \nHARVEY Hey Joyce, we got a message here. Why didn't you pick up. \nJoyce doesn't respond. \nHARVEY Useless. \nHe presses the play button. \nANGLE ON ANSWERING MACHINE: A loud \"beep,\" then ... \nMALE VOICE Hi, this is a message for Harvey Pekar. My name is Jonathan Greene and I'm a producer for LATE NIGHT WITH DAVID LETTERMAN. We'd like to talk to you about coming on the show to plug your comics. Please give me a call at 212-555-3333. \nHARVEY (O.S.) What the hell? \nJoyce sits up. Harvey's finger hits the \"Replay\" button. \nMALE VOICE Hi, this is a message for Harvey -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - 1980'S - DAY \nESTABLISHING SHOT \nThe impressive skyline glistens in the spring sun. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) Joyce finally got off the futon... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - NEW YORK - 1980'S - DAY \nArmed with shopping bags from Bleecker Bob's Record Shop, the Strand Book Store and Forbidden Planet Comic Book Emporium, HARVEY and JOYCE eat lunch on a park bench. Harvey chomps on a knish and watches oddball New Yorkers stroll by as Joyce nibbles on her hot dog. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL HALLWAY -- DAY \nCLOSE UP ON AN ICE BUCKET \nCut back to reveal Harvey, schlepping an ice bucket down a hall in his underwear. A FEMALE BUSINESS TRAVELER passes and stares at him. He enters a room with a \"DO NOT DISTURB\" sign. \nINT. NEW YORK HOTEL ROOM - 1980'S - DAY \nThe PEKARS have already wreaked havoc on their luxury hotel room. It looks like a tornado touched down on the New York Hilton. \n", "test3_input": "INT. TOWER BOOKS - 1980'S - DAY \nFADE IN: \nCLOSE UP: A GLOSSY, FULL-COLOR, NOVEL-SIZED COMIC COVER. \nScrawled across the top in yellow and red it read, \"Our Cancer Year.\" The drawing depicts Harvey doubled over on the front lawn, groceries in the snow, with Joyce attempting to help him up. A hand flips the book open and signs the inside leaf. \nJOYCE and a healthy-looking HARVEY sit at a table signing copies of their opus. About fifteen or so people mill about with copies. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) Here's our man a year later. Somehow I made it through the treatments, an' the doctors are optimistic. I guess Joyce was right about doin' the big comic book. We published the thing as a graphic novel -- our first collaboration -- and ended up with rave reviews. We even won the American Book Award. Go figure... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY \nThe place is still a mess but somehow it has a better vibe than it had before. This might be due to the presence of DANIELLE. She sits crossed legged on the floor making jewelry out of beads. JOYCE guides her. \nHARVEY shuffles into the room. He watches for a moment as Joyce and Danielle play. \nANGLE ON JOYCE: There is an awkward expression almost resembling a smile on her face. He interrupts them. \nHARVEY Hey Joyce. \nJoyce looks up. Harvey looks like he's trying to hide something. \nJOYCE What is it Harvey? \nHARVEY That was the doctor. \nJoyce stops what she's doing and gulps. She hangs on Harvey's every word. \nHARVEY He said I'm all clear. \nTears well in Harvey's eyes. Joyce breathes a sigh of relief and Danielle jumps up and runs over to Harvey. She hugs him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CLEVELAND ICE RINK - 1980 - DAY \nHARVEY sits in the bleachers, watching JOYCE teach DANIELLE to ice skate. \nHarvey's got a box of pizza next to him. He picks up a slice and chomps on it. The cheese drips out of his mouth onto his shirt. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) The weirdest thing that came outta my illness was Danielle. With her real mother runnin' around who knows where, an' seein' how well her and Joyce got on, Fred decided she'd have a better life with us. I was scared at first but then I thought, what the hell. She's a good kid. So we ended up takin' her an' raising her as our own. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - DAY \nHARVEY and DANIELLE lie on the futon together. Harvey's comics are strewn around the room everywhere. Danielle flips through one. \nHARVEY Ya keep readin' 'em backward. \nDANIELLE I like reading them backward. (holding up a comic) Is that you? \nHARVEY I keep tellin' ya, all of 'ems me, man. \nDANIELLE You look like a monster. \nHARVEY Yeah, well wait'll ya see what you're gonna look like. \nDANIELLE Me?? \nHARVEY Sure. Yer part of the story too, now. \nDANIELLE What story? \nHARVEY The story of my life. \nDanielle makes a face. \n", "test3_true": "DANIELLE Maybe I want to write my own comic. \nHARVEY Oh yeah? What about? \nDANIELLE I don't know yet. But not about you. You have enough already. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SCHOOL BUS STOP - FALL - PRESENT - DAY \nHARVEY walks towards the bus stop to send DANIELLE to school. \nHe holds her hand. \nHARVEY Ya know, you should write about things in your own life. Like school and... ponies... I don't know, girl stuff... \nDANIELLE (to Harvey) Do you have to hold my hand? \nHARVEY (wounded) What, are you embarrassed a' me? I know, I'm embarrassing. I felt the same way about my father. \nDanielle looks up at Harvey like he's crazy. \nDANIELLE No Harvey. You're just squeezing it too hard. (shaking her head) Joyce is right. You are obsessive compulsive. \nDanielle drops his hand and rushes onto the bus with other kids. \nHarvey waves and watches as it pulls away. \nHe turns and walks by himself down the busy Cleveland street -- \n-- a familiar image from the opening. He's still hunched over. He's still Harvey. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) Yeah, so I guess comics brought me a lot. But don't think this is some sunny, happy ending. Every day is still a major struggle. Joyce an' I fight like crazy, an' she barely works. The kid's got A.D.D. and is a real handful. My expenses have gone up so much that I'm writin' freelance 'round the clock, just to make my bills. My life is total chaos. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BUS STOP - FALL - PRESENT - DAY \nDOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE -- SHOT ON FILM \nNOW THE REAL HARVEY walks down the same busy Cleveland street towards his job. \nREAL HARVEY (V.O.) With a little luck, I'll get a window of good health between retirin' an dyin'. The golden years, right? Who knows. Between my pension and the chunk of change I got for this movie, I should be able to swing somethin'. Sure I'll lose the war eventually, but the goal is to win a few skirmishes along the way. Right? \nCUT TO: \nINT. V.A. HOSPITAL - PRESENT - DAY \nDOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE -- SHOT ON FILM \nTHE REAL HARVEY slumps at the desk now, flipping through a comic book. \nANGLE ON DOOR \nTHE REAL TOBY comes into the file room, carrying a cake with sparklers. He's followed by a group of Harvey's REAL COWORKERS and JOYCE and REAL DANIELLE. \nHarvey moves the comic off his desk so Toby can put the cake down. \nANGLE ON CAKE \nThe festive cake reads \"HAPPY RETIREMENT HARVEY.\" REAL JOYCE cuts the cake and passes slices to the group. \nANOTHER WORKER pops a bottle of champagne. \nCLOSE on a glass of champagne getting filled. The glass sits next to the comic Harvey was reading. \nCLOSE UP ON COMIC BOOK COVER \nHARVEY'S new edition of AMERICAN SPLENDOR is subtitled, \"OUR MOVIE YEAR.\" It features an illustration of HARVEY, JOYCE and DANIELLE surrounded by cameras, lights and crew. \n"}

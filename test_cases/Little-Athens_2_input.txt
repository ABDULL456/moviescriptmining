Jessica throws the Nachos on the coffee table and sits on the couch, head in her hands, on the verge of tears. 
JESSICA Shit, shit... 
PITT Yeah, you did it. 
JESSICA Fuck you, Pitt. 
INT. POOL, MEN'S BATHROOM -- MORNING 
COREY is MOPPING the floor. He glances up as Pedro steps over to him. Corey and Pedro talk and argue like two kids on a playground. 
PEDRO Hey, mehn. 
COREY What're you doing back? 
PEDRO I got your sister. (forming breasts with his hands) She got big. 
COREY That's my little sister. 
PEDRO She's hot, mehn. Esta buenisima. 
COREY Just take her back to our place! 
PEDRO I can't because we got no place.   We got thrown out. 
COREY He threw us out?! 
PEDRO Si! And all our shit's still in there! And Pancho, too! 
COREY That's illegal, isn't it?!   He can't just lock us out! 
PEDRO Si, he sucks cock. I mean, I gotta go find a job, I smell like shit, I'm fucked! 
COREY Maybe you should talk to your boss.    Like, ask him to take you back. 
PEDRO No, fuck him, mehn! Just gimme Mr. Cocksucker's address. 
COREY What for? 
PEDRO I take care of this. 
COREY Don't do anything that'll get us into trouble. 
PEDRO Do you think I'm stupid, mehn? Don't worry about this. I talk to him. But first I take care of business. 
Pedro bangs on a stall door, with no response.    Pedro pushes the door to the stall open. 
PEDRO (CONT'D) Okay, mehn.     Good. Voy a cagar. 
Pedro disappears behind the door of the stall.    Corey leans his Mop against the wall and exits. 
EXT. CAR'S HOUSE -- DAY 
JIMMY pulls his PIECE-OF-SHIT into the driveway of what appears to be a one-story house, next to a RANGE ROVER. He climbs out with the strap of his BACKPACK hanging over one shoulder and walks around the house to the back yard. 
The yard slopes significantly from the front yard to the back yard, and the view of the back of the house reveals two stories. As Jimmy turns the corner, he spots a black CAT walking up to him. He grabs the Cat. 
INT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 
WIDE on Jimmy holding the Cat behind a set of sliding glass doors, one door partially open. He enters and shuts the door behind him. Music is playing through stereo speakers, and a black-and-white movie is playing on the TV with the sound shut off. CAR, an Asian- American late-twenty-something, is sitting back on the couch facing 
the TV. Magazines, junk food, remote controls and a CORDLESS PHONE are spread out on the coffee table. If Car notices Jimmy enter the room, he shows no sign of it. 
JIMMY Saw your cat outside. 
Jimmy tosses the Cat on the floor, and it scurries off to another part of the house. Jimmy sits in a recliner beside the couch, glad to take a load off. Jimmy takes a peak at the TV. 
JIMMY (CONT'D) I gotta get back to work. I got more pies in the car. 
No response. The Cordless Phone starts ringing.    Car remains perfectly still. 
JIMMY (CONT'D) Car? 
No response.   The Cordless Phone continues to ring. 
Jimmy leans over from his chair and waves a hand in front of Car. Nothing. Jimmy jumps up from his recliner. He stares at Car. He steps over, takes two fingers and checks Car's pulse. He stands back, unsure of what to do. 
Hesitant, Jimmy walks over to a closet, opens the door, and slides a GYM BAG out into the room. He opens the Gym Bag and pulls out a large bag of MARIJUANA and a few jars of K. He throws them into his Backpack, zips up the Gym Bag, and puts it back into the closet. 
Jimmy exits through the sliding glass doors. 
EXT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 
Jimmy shuts the doors behind him. He stops in his tracks just outside the doors, thoughts running through his mind. 
INT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 
WIDE on Jimmy through the doors as he about faces and stares into the house. He slides the doors open and re-enters. 
He picks up the Gym Bag and carries it to the front of the couch. He sets down Gym Bag and drops to his knees, all while noticing that Car appears to be staring at him. He unloads the remaining contents of the Gym Bag into his Backpack, including a few bags of PILLS, a few more jars of K, and two large bags of WHITE POWDER. 
He throws one strap of his Backpack over his shoulder and stands in front of Car. Jimmy stares at Car.

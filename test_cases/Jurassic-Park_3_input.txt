ARNOLD That's not the worst of it. 
HAMMOND Oh yeah?  Please tell me what's worse than the lights going out? 
Wu smashes through the door. 
WU All the security doors are open.  Someone has been in my laboratory and the eggs have been disturbed. 
The camera pushes in on Hammond's face. 
HAMMOND Where the hell is Nedry?  Where is he? Did anybody check the damn john? 
Hammond storms out. 
INT  CORRIDOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION 
Hammond enters the hall.  Muldoon, racing from the other direction, yells: 
MULDOON John, the generator's shut down.  Who cut the power? 
HAMMOND Arnold's on it.  You go out and bring back the tour right away.  I don't need any of this! 
Muldoon is already running back the way he came. 
INT  GARAGE - NIGHT 
Several electric land cruisers are stored in this shadowy room.  There is a glassed-in area where Muldoon's weapons are stored:  assault rifles, tasers, tear gas canisters. 
To the side of the garage s Muldoon's red jeep.  In the passenger side of the front seat is a rocket launcher. 
Nedry storms in, wheeling his incubator.  He stop suddenly and listens. Approaching FOOTSTEPS. 
NEDRY Oh, shit! 
INT  BASEMENT STAIRS, VISITOR'S CENTER - 
Muldoon runs down a long corridor, stop with a skid and yanks open the door to the garage.  He runs out.  His boots RESOUND on the concrete. 
BACK ON - NEDRY'S PANICKED FACE as he listens to the footsteps. Wheezing, with great difficulty, Nedry bends his knees and strains.  With everything he's got, he lifts the incub ator waist-height.  And holds it. 
BACK ON MULDOON - Muldoon's footsteps ECHO as they come closer and closer to the garage.  Muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs.  His jacket catches on an incomplete section of banister. Yanks him to a stop. 
CLOSE ON - Muldoon's jacket as it RIPS, stays caught. 
BACK ON - NEDRY as he tries to heave higher, can't.  Beads a sweat roll down his brow. 
MULDOON FREES HIS caught jacket and then keep going. 
Nedry's face drips with sweat.  The incubator slips out of his sweaty palms.  Catches it with his knee.  Nedry curses and with one forceful boost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height. 
CLOSE ON - Muldoon's feet on long stairwell. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. 
NERVOUS, NEDRY BREATHES in a labored fashion.  He looks this way and that.  He closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves the incubator into the back seat of the red jeep.  Nedry exhales. 
At that moment, MULDOON ENTERS the vestibule between stairs and garage. 
NEDRY EYES the shadowy figure in the vestibule. Nedry's frightened face. 
MULDOON STOPS and reaches in his belt.  He pulls out his pistol.  He takes out long, shiny cartridges.  He loads the pistol. 
NEDRY LEAPS in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher, and zooms into the night. 
A moment later, Muldoon enters the garage.  He sniffs at the exhaust that still hangs in the air.  He looks over and is surprised to see his jeep gone.  He bends and inspects fresh tread marks. He looks up, his face straining to understand. 
EXT  PARK ROAD - NIGHT 
Nedry's red jeep flies down the park road. 
CLOSE ON - Nedry's wheel as he turns it. 
His tires skid sideways, then regain traction.  The jeep bolts up a smaller access road.  He skids to a stop at the top of the hill. 
Nedry jumps out and looks up.  His high beams illuminate a huge electric fence prominently labeled:  DANGER!  10,000 Volts! 
Two safety fences separate Nedry from the electric fence.  He races to the first one, pulls out a key chain.  He tries one key, then another, and another.  It f its.  Nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door. 
Nedry runs to the second gate.  He slips in the mud.  He slides to the ground, dropping keys in a muddy pool. 
CLOSE ON - Nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the muddy water.  Got them!   Unlocks the second gate. 
He races to the electric fence.  RAIN PELTS him now.  Water beads on his face.  Lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning. 
He grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open. 
Nedry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams. He jumps in the jeep and drives through.  Behind him, the open gates move recklessly in the stormy night. 
BACK ON GARAGE 
Ellie and Harding pull in, in their own gas-powered jeep.  Muldoon is waiting for them.  Now there's a rifle slung over his shoulder.  Harding jumps out of the jeep. 
MULDOON Get out, get out!  I need this jeep. There's a problem with the tour.  Ellie, Hammond'll fill you in. 
Ellie is concerned, the n decisive. 
ELLIE No!  I'm going with you, Muldoon.

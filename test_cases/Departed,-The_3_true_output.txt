DIGNAM A better question is why your fuckers were following him. 
COLIN I told Internal Investigations to follow him. 
DIGNAM Why? 
COLIN That's internal Investigations business. 
DIGNAM grabs COLIN by the neck and runs him into a wall. COLIN gets a palm under Dignam's chin and comes close to breaking his neck. The men at length are separated. COLIN straightens his good clothes. 
COLIN (CONT'D) I have to investigate everybody and anybody. I don't have to justify anything. Nor does anyone have to like it. I now have information... (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: COLIN (CONT'D) from a very good source...that Queenan may have been killed by his own undercover. 
COLIN is trying this on. 
DIGNAM That's a fucking lie. 
COLIN Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam here have information on this undercover, and other informants, in a locked file. I need those files unlocked. 
DIGNAM I don't have the password.   Why don't you come down to the garage... 
COLIN That's a lie. 
DIGNAM hits COLIN in the face. COLIN goes down hard, into the crook of a file cabinet and the wall. Blood from his mouth. 
DIGNAM No one calls me a liar. Especially when I'm lying. 
ELLERBY Everybody shut up. (to BROWN) Work with the tech guys to unlock the files. Dignam. You take a leave of absence. 
DIGNAM Leave of what? 
ELLERBY Queenan's dead. That makes me your boss. 
DIGNAM I'll hand in my papers first. 
COLIN What? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
ELLERBY Hey, world needs plenty of bartenders. Two weeks with pay. 
DIGNAM Good. 
COLIN I need those codes. 
ELLERBY No, you want those codes. 
EXT. MADOLYN'S OFFICE BUILDING. NIGHT 
When she comes out: BILLY is waiting. 
BILLY I tried to call you a few times. 
MADOLYN I know.     (I know.).   I can't... 
He leans close to her.    She strokes his head. 
MADOLYN (CONT'D) I can't be a friend to you. I can't. I'm sorry. 
BILLY It's okay, okay, I know. 
MADOLYN walks away. 
INTERCUT COLIN'S OFFICE #2/COSTELLO'S CONDOMINIUM. NIGHT 
COLIN needs a shower and is gun-shy as people move past the glass windows. He is still rinsing blood out of his mouth. 
COSTELLO is listening to LUCIA di LAMMAMOOR. GWEN sits nearby in attractive lingerie, reading a book. 
COSTELLO Now, when I hear Lucia, I can't stop thinking about the cocaine curtsy you did on that nigger broad's face. (the phone rings. Costello answers:) What? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COLIN (into phone) Your shouldn't have killed Queenan. 
COSTELLO One of us was going to have to die. With me it tends to be the other guy. 
COLIN (agitated) You're crazy, Frank. You killed the guy who has all the information. And Dignam's not in the office, he's gone. He resigned. 
COSTELLO I don't give a fuck about Dignam. 
COLIN He's fucking gone. They took his papers in. He's not talking. I don't know where he is. 
COSTELLO Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie. That Irish piss-ant won't be a problem. He's so hot for me, we give him a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it. Let's give him a whiff. 
COLIN I will. 
COSTELLO Don't worry. I'll take care of it. 
COSTELLO turns to the GWEN. 
COSTELLO (CONT'D) Sweetheart, you're giving me a hard- on. 
He starts to dial the phone. 
GWEN Are you sure it's me or all that talk about whiffin' and crawlin' up asses? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
COSTELLO Hey, watch your fucking mouth. 
GWEN You watch it. 
She rises and as she crosses:

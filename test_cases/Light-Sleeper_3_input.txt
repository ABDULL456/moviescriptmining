LETOUR Yes. 
TERESA This was very important in your life. 
LETOUR Yes. 
TERESA You are in the balance. Everything you do -- positive or negative -- in this life is a drop that will carry over in the next. Every act, every decision matters. 
LETOUR Teresa? 
TERESA What is it? 
LETOUR I'm thirty-eight years old. (beat) Forty. 
TERESA You're young. 
LETOUR I have trouble sleeping. (TERESA waits) Look. What do you see around me? Is there anything? Is it dark? Have I run out of luck? Is there luck? 
TERESA I see a glow. Everything you need is around you. The only danger is inside you. 
CUT TO: 
MONEY CHANGER 
Ann's apartment. The night has already begun. ANN sits on the floor beside a YOUNG HASID counting money. He wears Orthodox garb: black hat, black coat, peyas. Tibetan bells reverb from speakers as the Bergmanesque cambist runs faced twenty-dollar bills through a battery-operated counting machine, places stacks of cash on the floor. ROBERT returns a call from the kitchen; LETOUR emerges from the bathroom, wiping his hands. 
ANN (to LETOUR and ROBERT) Your pay's on the table. 
JOHN walks to the cosmetics corner, finds an envelope with his name on it, looks inside: $500 in twenties. He pockets the money. 
LETOUR sits as HASID double-checks the total: cash covers the available floor space. 
YOUNG HASID (dialogue punctuates action) One hundred thirty-one, let's make it 130-$13,000, hundreds for small bills. One percent commission, $130 to you -- add tens or whatever if you want. 
Opening a satchel, he removes bound $100s, counts off 130 as ANN adds up commission in small bills. He loads the satchel: 
YOUNG HASID Same time? 
ANN (nods) Two weeks -- don't run. Stay a while. We'll order kosher. We'll tell you dirty stories. We'll talk Zionism. 
The HASID laughs. He likes her. 
YOUNG HASID (passes hundreds) I'm late already. I only come 'cause I like you. Sure you're not Jewish? I don't want to see you hurt. Find a man. You should do something else. 
ANN (offers commission) Invest in my cosmetics line. 
YOUNG HASID (takes money) Don't mix business with friendship. 
ANN follows him to the door. 
YOUNG HASID Shalom. 
ANN Shalom. (opens door) See you next week. (calls after him) Don't eat any hot dogs! 
ANN closes door.

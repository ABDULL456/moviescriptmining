(MUTTERS) But I might be... 
She leaves. 
INT. KITCHEN - SAME 
Coraline pulls open the key drawer, looking for the small black key. Not there. She looks around, then spots it hanging on a hook above a door. She stands on a chair and snags it. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME 
Coraline stoops in front of the small door and pushes the key into the keyhole and unlocks the door. 
She listens for her mother's car. Nothing. Grasping the key between thumb and forefinger, she closes her eyes, she pulls the door open. 
ANGLE ON CORALINE: A SOFT BREEZE MOVES her hair. She knows before her eyes open that the BRICKS ARE GONE. 
CORALINE 
(TRIUMPHANT) I knew it was real! 
She opens her eyes, smiles, and CRAWLS FORWARD. 
ANGLE ON CORALINE THROUGH WINDOW. CAMERA PULLS BACK and we FIND the BLACK CAT, perched on the wet window sill, OBSERVING Coraline as she disappears into the tunnel. With a look of concern, he exits frame. 
INT. OTHER KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Lunch is ready and waiting for her: foot-long hotdogs with relish; grilled cheese sandwiches with gherkins; curly-fries; piles of coleslaw and potato salad; five flavors of soda-pop. There's a NOTE attached to a GIFT- 
WRAPPED BOX: 
OTHER MOTHER (V.O.) Dearest Coraline, 
M iss Spink and Miss Forcible have invited you downstairs after lunch. I hope you like the new outfit I made you! Love, Mother. 
Coraline tears open the box and finds a pair of beautiful BLUE BOOTS, BLACK CORDUROY TROUSERS, and a METALLIC GREY 
SWEATER WITH TWINKLING STARS. 
She holds up the sweater to her body, smiles, then puts down the clothes and digs into lunch. 
EXT. OTHER HOUSE - SAME 
Coraline, dressed in her FANCY NEW CLOTHES, steps onto the FRONT PORCH and BURPS. It's always nighttime in this world. 
A CAT MEEEROWS. Coraline looks up to see a BLACK CAT on the porch roof above her. 
Coraline raises her brows, studies the animal a moment. 
CORALINE Hmmm... Wybie's got a cat like you at home. Not the quiet Wybie; the one that talks too much. You must be the Other Cat. 
The cat LEAPS down and lands on the railing by the basement stairs. He shakes his head and SPEAKS! 
CAT No. I'm not the other anything. I'm me. 
He tips his head to one side, opal blue eyes glinting. Coraline is surprised. 
CORALINE Um... I can see you don't have button eyes. But if you're the same cat, how can you talk? 
The cat shrugs from the tip of his tail to his whiskers. 
CAT I just can. 
He leaps smoothly from the railing and onto a large, 
FALLEN TREE. 
CORALINE Cats don't talk at home. 
CAT No? 
CORALINE Nope. 
Climbs up the tree's upended roots, head held high and proud. 
CAT 
(DRYLY) Well, you're clearly the expert on these things. After all, I'm just a big fat wuss puss. 
CORALINE Come back. Please? I... I'm sorry I called you that, I really am. 
Coraline forces herself to be polite. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) How'd you get here? 
CAT I've been coming here for a while. 
He DISAPPEARS behind one a thick root that sticks up, then REAPPEARS from a large knot hole beside Coraline, startling her. 
CAT (CONT'D) It's a game we play. She... (indicates house) ...hates cats and tries to keep me out. But she can't, of course. 
He pokes his HEAD DOWN into the knot hole, then POPS IT UP out of ANOTHER KNOT-HOLE, ten feet away. 
CAT (CONT'D) I come and go as I please. 
CORALINE

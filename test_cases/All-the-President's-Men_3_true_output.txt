RESEARCHER (shrugs) Our Dahlberg file. 
As she leaves-- 
CUT TO: 
The photo. 
It is a picture of Hubert Humphrey standing next to another man. The caption identifies that other man as KENNETH DAHLBERG. Now-- 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD AT HIS DESK. 
The room is reasonably quiet. ROSENFELD is visible in his office. As WOODWARD picks up the phone, gets Minneapolis information-- 
CUT TO: 
ROSENFELD'S PHONE RINGING. He hurries in, grabs it. 
BERNSTEIN'S VOICE (V.O.) Harry--I know how to get Dahlberg-- 
ROSENFELD --Woodward's talking to him know. 
CUT TO: 
BERNSTEIN, drenched. There are no dimes left. He listens a moment more, then nods, hangs up, leans back against the glass, takes a deep breath, closes his eyes as we 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD on the phone. 
WOODWARD --this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in-- (pause) --and I was kind of curious about your check. 
DAHLBERG (V.O.) ...check...? 
WOODWARD The twenty-five thousand dollar one. (silence) The one with your name on it. (silence) In Bernard Barker's Florida account. (still nothing) Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar-- 
DAHLBERG (V.O.) (struggling) ...you're definitely doing a story...? 
WOODWARD Yes, sir. 
DAHLBERG (V.O.) I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper. (WOODWARD waits, pen ready; tense as hell) I know I shouldn't tell you this... 
WOODWARD's lips are going "tell me, tell me." 
DAHLBERG (V.O.) That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign. 
WOODWARD I see. And how do you think it reached Miami? 
DAHLBERG (V.O.) I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine. 
WOODWARD (trying to keep his voice level) That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg. 
CUT TO: 
AN ARTICLE WITH WOODWARD'S NAME ON THE BYLINE. 
ROSENFELD holds it. 
ROSENFELD CREEP financed the Watergate break- in, Jesus Christ. 
He starts off. 
WOODWARD One sec'-- 
WOODWARD takes the story, scrawls BERNSTEIN's name in front of his on the byline. ROSENFELD watches. As WOODWARD finishes, he takes the story again, hurries off. Now-- 
CUT TO: 
THE HEADLINE OF THEIR STORY: 
"Campaign Funds Found in Watergate Burglar's Account." 
Now-- 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
that it isn't exactly a gigantic headline piece. As a matter of fact, as more and more of page one appears, we see that their story is tucked away at the bottom and as bigger and bigger headlines are visible-- 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
--the whole first page. Plastered across the top in giant letters is the following: "EAGLETON RESIGNS." And as you look at the whole page now, you can barely make out the tiny piddling Watergate story. The point is abundantly clear: nobody cared a whole lot. 
CUT TO: 
THE TRIANGLE 
being rung like crazy. And as it SOUNDS--

Phil is under pressure. 
PHIL Joshua Tree, yeah. 
A buzzer sounds.         No-one moves. 
PHIL (CONT'D) Joshua Tree, Louisiana. Just outside the city. 
CLERK Never heard of that. 
CON TINUE D: 
PHIL It's small. Just another local community struggling to get by. 
The buzzer goes again, and Phil attempts to change the subject. 
PHIL (CONT'D) Use your phone? 
After a moment, the clerk nods towards the phone on the desk, before turning and disappearing into the rear of the mortuary. Phil wipes some sweat from his forehead, picks up the phone and dials. 
INT. PHIL'S LOUNGE. MORNING Susie is packing. The phone rings and she hesitates for a moment. Then she continues loading her case, leaving the phone unanswered. 
INT. CHECK IN DESK. DAY 
Stanley tries to ask a question at the check in desk, but gives up and walks toward an exit. 
INT. MORTUARY. MORNING 
The clerk returns with a casket on a gurney and Phil replaces the receiver as the clerk flips open the top of the casket and peers inside. 
CLERK (into casket) Hello there. We was looking for you. 
He wheels the casket over and Phil has a quick look inside. 
CLERK (CONT'D) Need you to sign for it again. 
Phil signs the papers. 
CLERK (CONT'D) Looks like it's your lucky day after all. 
PHIL Yeah.   I'm a real lucky guy. 
Phil again glances out of the window. 
EXT. OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING 
The cop is wandering around the hearse.    Larry trails behind him, disconsolately. 
COP I don't like the look of you. 
LARRY (miserably) No. Fair enough. 
COP Wherever there's a hippie there's a crime, even if it hasn't happened yet. That's what I always say. 
LARRY Right.   Good saying. 
He prods at the broken light with his baton. 
COP So whatcha doing here? 
LARRY We're meeting someone off a flight. 
COP You're meeting someone off a flight? 
LARRY Yes. 
COP In a hearse? 
LARRY Yes.   It's a... surprise. 
COP Which parts the surprise: The fact that you're in a bright yellow hearse, the fact that you're dressed like something out of a horror film, or the fact that you're half a mile from the terminal and they're gonna have to walk across two runways to reach you? 
Larry is looking increasingly desperate. 
CON TINUE D: 
LARRY Well... the first part.

CONTINUED: 
MAGGIE What? 
JAKE I want to stay at Uncle Steve's, I don't want to go home. 
MAGGIE Why not? 
JAKE Because I'm not safe there. Because of the feathers. 
MAGGIE What does that mean, Jake? He shrugs. Philip, Maggie's brother, stands in the doorway to the other room. 
PHILIP It's okay, I can watch him. Maggie, in a hurry, agrees. She bends over and kisses Jake on the forehead. 
MAGGIE Be good. She opens the door and heads out. As it's swinging shut: 
JAKE Don't stop for the train, Mommy. 
EXT UNCLE STEVE'S HOUSE NIGHT Maggie hears that just as the door closes behind her. She misses a step, thinking about it, then starts walking to her car. She walks faster. Then she runs. 
CUT TO: 
INT BASEMENT NIGHT In the basement, Tom abruptly stops digging, staring at the dirt. The corner of something shiny is sticking out from the pile. He bends down and pulls it out. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: It's a piece of clear blue plastic sheeting, about two inches square. Tom's hand starts to shake as he holds it. 
AN IMAGE flas.es through his mind again, the one he's seen twice befoi-. A FACE, too close to his, sting at him through that blurr blue, like through bad eyeglasses. 
IN THE BASEMENT, Tom turns and leaps into the hole, shovel in hand. He begins to dig, wildly, flinging dirt in all directions. At one end of the hole, his shovel slips, the dirt spilling off it as it sticks on something. Something buried. Tom drops the shovel. He falls to his knees and uses his hands to rake the dirt away from whatever it was. More blue plastic. Tom tugs out about eight inches of the plastic, gets a good grip on it with both hands. He pulls it up. Like a rope pulled out of the sand, the edge of the blue plastic rises up, unearthing itself in a line down the middle of the pit. Breathing hard, Tom grabs the shovel again. 
THE DIRT, flies away from the plastic as Tom works furiously. 
TOM'S FACE is of a man possessed. He digs as fast as he can. 
FINALLY, Tom stands back, staring down at what he has unearthed. Above him, we see what it is. A long piece of blue plastic, wrapped around something about five and a half feet long and two and a half feet wide. Tom bends down and lays one hand on the plastic. He flinches. 
AN IMAGE pops into his mind, another familiar one. A FIGURE IN Afl OVERCOAT, standing on the front porch of Tom's own house in winter, waving to us to come up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
IN THE BASEMENT, Tom jerks his hand off the plastic. He swallows. He goes to hi= toolbox and pulls out a utility knife. He slides the ra or blade forward. He goes to one and of the plastic, bends down, and jams the knife through the sheeting. He walks the length of it, making a slit down the middle. He reaches out with shaking hands and pulls part of the plastic back. The first thing he sees is a partially decomposed human hand. Around the withered wrist, there are a half dozen multi- colored bracelets. Tom yanks the rest of the plastic away, revealing the half- decomposed body of Samantha Muller, still in the black dress with the diamond pattern. Tom stands there, his chest heaving. He looks at her hand, thinking. He sits down next to her. He reaches out for her hand, then pulls his own back. Can't do it. But he's gotta. He opens his hand, reaching out for hers. He slides his hand underneath -- takes a deep breath -- -- and closes his living fingers around her skeletal ones. He GASPS. His face turns a horrible shade of pale, his lips go ice blue, and STEAM comes out of his mouth, the way it did hers when he first saw her in his living room. 
EXT TOM'S HOUSE DAY It's a wintry day. That same steam rises up in front of us, coming from our own mouth. We're looking at the front porch of Tom's house as we walk past it. The house is being remodeled, it's surrounded by scaffolding, its windows covered with plastic Duvateen. The Figure in the Overcoat waves to us.

Don is sitting with the tiny creature. He pulls a ration pack from his pocket. Turns it over in his hand. 
WEST 
And the flavor of the day is ... banana/beef. Who thinks up these combinations? 
The creature stares at him intently as he tears open the foil lip, sucks a bit LOUDLY. Judy can't help but smile at him. 
WEST 
MM. Good. 
SMITH 
Major West, I highly recommend you never breed. That by the way is my medical opinion. 
Don glares at him, hands the tiny creature the pouch. The creature looks at it, emits a small BLIP, takes a tentative suck. Its eyes widen in delight as it begins to suck the ration pack. 
WEST 
Little thing was hungry. 
SMITH 
Good Lord, who will - spare us the tyranny of the sentimental? 
(OVER) a distant, high pitched WHINE. 
PENNY 
Do you hear something? 
Suddenly the creature begins to SCREAM, leaping on Smith's back, clinging to his neck for dear life. 
SMITH 
Get this infernal creature off me. 
The WHINE is growing louder. it seems to be coming from above. 
THE CEILING-CLOSE. There, in the corner, the membrane covering the hole seems to be trembling. 
WEST 
This can't be good. 
SMITH 
You have a remarkably keen sense of the obvious. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
Maureen stands with Penny at the main sensor station. 
MAUREEN 
John, get the hell out of there. 
ON SCREEN. The silver disks on the hull of the probe ship are beginning to move, rising to stand now on spindraled legs. 
EXT.-PROBE SHIP 
Heads and legs emerging, the disks reveal themselves to be armor plated spiders. The monsters find viscous holes in the outer hull and push through, vanishing into the probe ship. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
(OVER) a THUD. The Jupiter Two shakes, as if struck. 
MAUREEN 
Give me an external view. 
Penny works the console. 
ON SCREEN. Spiders are leaping from the probe onto the Jupiter Two. 
INT.-PROBE SHIP-BRIDGE 
The lizard monkey's SCREAMING has reached new heights of hysteria. A shape begins to push through the viscous bole in the ceiling. 
What bursts in is a monster out of nightmare. Nearly half the size of a human, shiny metallic body from which wet, spider-like limbs extend. A fang covered vAw opens below ravenous, green eyes. 
Don draws his laser and FIRES, but the blast only reflects off the metallic surface of its torso, forcing the creature to retract its limbs and eyes, hiding within its protective shell. 
JOHN 
Evacuate. Now! 
The team races for the door as several more spiders drop through the hole in the ceiling, landing in the bridge and scampering fast towards our fleeing heros. 
INT.-PROBE SHIP-TUNNELS 
The boarding party race down the corridor. The spiders are bounding after them, using walls, floor, and ceiling with equal facility. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
Will is madly working his keyboard, controlling the fleeing Robot. 
WILL 
This joy stick is too slow. Activate holographic interface. 
A holographic robot appears on the bridge. Will steps inside, the image now moving with his body. He spins, facing backwards, firing. 
INT.-PROBE SHIP 
The Robot is holding up the rear, its torso swiveled backwards so it can retreat and FIRE simultaneously. 
The Robot's plasma BLASTS have more effect than-the lasers, blowing the spiders into tiny pieces of inhuman flesh and metal. 
But more monsters are pouring through the holes in the corridor ceiling, some giving chasing, others swarming injured comrades. 
Judy watches as several spiders devour their fallen brethren. 
JUDY 
They eat their wounded. 
Our heroes race to a nexus, corridors leading off in all directions. Spiders are dropping from the ceiling around them. 
JOHN 
Which way? 
INT. -JUPITER TWO 
WILL-POV. A graphic map flashes within the holograph. 
WILL 
Turn left. 
INT.-PROBE SHIP-CORRIdOR 
ROBOT 
Now right. 
The spiders are swarming, closing fast. 
JOHN 
Got to seal the bulkhead. 
WEST 
The door control is at the other and of the corridor. 
JUDY

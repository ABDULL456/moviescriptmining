Apprehensively Chuck shakes and retreats to a lower bunk. Robin tacks up the picture above his bunk.  Terry unpacks in front of one of the lower berths. 
A loud "THUD!" turns everyone around.  A duffel bag lies at the bottom of the companionway.  A large imposing figure climbs into the cabin. 
This is JOHN GOODALL, 17, over six feet, big and broad. His hair is slicked back "Dean" style and wears a full day's growth of bread on his face.  Compared to the others, he looks all man.  Everybody clears from his path. He stops in front of the lower, center bunk (Terry's bunk) and drops his bag. 
JOHN I'll take this one. 
TERRY You probably didn't notice, but this bunk has been taken. 
John just glares at him, then dumps all of Terry's things onto the blanket on the bunk, gathers it up and tosses it into the remaining upper berth.  Terry watches, intimidated. 
JOHN Anybody gotta problem with that? 
RICK (beat) Absolutely not. 
John climbs into his bunk and closes his eyes.  Bill enters, followed by several adults. 
DR. ALICE SHELDRAKE, 30, smart, attractive and tough, is ship's surgeon and Skipper's wife.  Lawford appears with GEORGE PASCAL, 30's from Brazil, dark, and fit. 
BILL Alright, listen up.  This is Dr. Alice Sheldrake. 
The guys stumble over only half listening. 
ALICE I'm ship's surgeon.  I'm in charge of aches, pains, biology, math and science. 
BILL George Pascal here is ship's cook. 
GEORGE If you want to keep all your fingers, stay the hell out of my galley unless you're invited. 
BILL Some of you already know Mr. Lawford. 
LAWFORD I have been charged with the dubious task of insuring your literary education. 
Lawford puts a hand on Bill's shoulder. 
LAWFORD Bill Butler is your first mate.  But don't let his size fool you. 
Bill gives a half reluctant wave. 
MIKE So when the hell do we get to meet El Capitan? 
Snickering. 
TERRY (aside) Maybe he's getting his wooden leg waxed. 
Laughter.  A sound stops the laughter.  Almost on cue, the sound of slow methodical footsteps, pace the deck above them.  Then a shadow falls across the skylight, blocking the light.  Ominous.  They all notice and look up. 
LAWFORD (mysterious) You'll meet him.  Soon enough. 
INT.  MAIN CABIN - SUNRISE 
Dawn glows orange in the skylights above the cabin.  The only sound is the heavy, even breathing of slumber. Suddenly, a booming voice rumbles down the companionway. 
LAWFORD (O.S.) Arise, Arise, Arise... 
Chuck wakes, disoriented.  Terry bolts upright and hits his head on the low ceiling.  Ouch. 
Tod, Rick and Charlie are up instantly.  Lawford's voice echoes through the ship. 
LAWFORD (O.S.) Exultation is the going/ Of an inland soul to sea/ Past the houses/ Past the headlands/ Into deep Eternity/ Bred as we, among the mountains/ Can the sailor understand/ the divine intoxication/ of the first league out from land? (pause) But I suppose we'll answer that question soon enough gentlemen. Soon enough. 
TERRY What question? 
Chuck tries to assimilate Lawford's words.  Robin swings his feet over the side of his bunk with a tortured look. John rolls over and pulls his pillow over his head. 
ROBIN (foggy) What the hell is going on? 
CHUCK Maybe it's an air raid. 
In crisply pressed shorts and shirt, Bill Butler steps through the aft bulkhead.  He raises a bowswain's  whistle and blows.  OOOWWWEEEEOOO!!!!  Chuck and Robin grab their ears.  It's a nightmare.  Terry jumps and hits his head again. 
BILL Roll out sailors!  All hands on deck!  Sixty seconds.  Sixty seconds. 
He blows the whistle again.  This time it brings even John to his feet, staring down at Bill in a blind rage.  Bill looks up and casually notices him. 
BILL You gotta problem Goodall? 
JOHN You blow that thing again I'll shove it so far up your ass, you're gonna need dental floss to get it out. 
BILL Just get on deck. 
Bill turns and disappears topside. 
EXT.  DECK - DAWN 
The sun has barely cracked the horizon as the crew staggers onto the deck, shirtless and shivering. 
BILL Line up!  Single file.  Single file. 
The crew lines up.  John is the last one through the hatch and he lets us know his boundaries are being pressed. 
BILL Everybody swims. 
The boys are aghast. 
LAWFORD Don't think people, just go!  Go, Go, Go, Go, Go!!!  Swim you win, stay you pay!! 
Rick is the first one through the gunnel door, followed by Tod and Charlie.  They howl and scream as they hit the water.  The rest follow like lemmings.  But John stands defiantly with his arms folded.

-- and that's why wildebeests are so mean. 
PRIMATE GENE Grunt grunt!0 Ha ha! 
PRIMATE LENNY Grunt grunt grunt! 0 That's really funny! 
PRIMATE PHIL Grunt ...0 I don't get it... The other three look at him. 
EXT. THE CAVE AREA - DAY 
PRIMATE WOMEN work in stooped-over positions, trying to pound roots and tend fires while BABY PRIMATES crawl all over them. They HEAR the Primate Guys' laughter trailing off. They trade looks; Something seems to pass between them... 
EXT. HUNTING GROUNDS - DAY 
Primates Roger, Gene, Lenny and Phil get to the grounds and SEE PRIMATES PETE and LOUIE already there. These two don't have the rock slabs though. 
PRIMATE ROGER Grunt grunt?0 Whassup? 
PRIMATE PETE Grunt grunt grunt. 0 Nothing. We've been hunting. 
PRIMATE GENE Grunt grunt? 0 Where are your jagged rock slabs? 
PRIMATE LOUIE Grunt? â Slabs? (looks at Primate 
PETE) Grunt grunt grunt? â Who needs slabs? Primate Pete laughs with him; then holds up a ROUND ROCK, about the size of a grapefruit. Primate Roger and Primate Gene trade looks with Primate Lenny and Primate Phil. Grunting/subtitles continue. 
FIRST FOUR PRIMATES Ooooohhhh. Ooooohhhh. 
PRIMATE ROGER Where'd you get that? 
PRIMATE PETE Primate Discount Manny. He just got them in. 
PRIMATE ROGER Mind if I have a look? 
PRIMATE PETE Be my guest. He hands it over. Primate Roger lays down his jagged rock slab to check it out. His buddies gather round. 
PRIMATE GENE How do you kill an animal with that? 
PRIMATE LOUIE You throw it. 
PRIMATE LENNY You mean you don't chase the old ones until they get tired and then hit them with the jagged rock slabs? 
PRIMATE PETE (shakes his head) You can stand in one place all day. And when they go by, you just let loose. He shows a throwing motion. The first four look intrigued. 
PRIMATE LOUIE You can carry more than one - and if you're throwing uphill, it rolls back down if you miss. It's so much easier with these. 
PRIMATE GENE -- I'm sticking with mine. (then off their looks) We've been using these jagged slabs forever. And you know why? Because they work. And anyway, killing them is only half of it -- how are you gonna skin a wildebeest with that? They look at Primate Pete: Yeah, how? But he's there. 
PRIMATE PETE We get the women to do it. They look among themselves. They like it. But then. 
PRIMATE ROGER How? 
PRIMATE PETE -- I'm working on it.

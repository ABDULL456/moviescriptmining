Bond and Christmas waiting expectantly.  Tense silence. 
Finally, a WHOOSHING NOISE, GETTING LOUDER.  Lights appear behind, reflecting on a bend, then... here it comes, the rig tearing through the pipe. 
Bond looks over his shoulder at Christmas' speedometer...she's only at fifty... 
BOND Faster! Get our speed up! 
Christmas presses forward...Bond turns, his feet OUT toward the approaching rig...the lights getting closer... closer... 
Bond's rig jolts as the other makes contact.  He cushions the blow with his feet.  Both rigs moving together now, he CLIMBS ONTO THE BOMB RIG...Puts out a hand, helps Christmas across. 
The bomb sits there, daunting, deadly. 
CHRISTMAS Tactical fission device.  Low yield. 
They look at one another, then set straight to work. 
INT. COMMAND ROOM - PIPELINE CONTROL CENTRE - CONTINUOUS 
The room is quiet, tense.  M and her two men, Elektra, Gabor, the King TECHNICIAN and three armed security guards at the doors. They are the only ones left.  Going down with the ship...if it goes.  M and Elektra watch the two lights now together on the console.  A tense silence.  Everyone's edgy. Elektra perhaps a little more than the rest.  She exchanges a glance with Gabor. 
INT. ELECTRIC RIG - PIPELINE (TRAVELLING) - DAY 
CLOSE INSIDE THE BOMB:  the timer.  1:45 MINUTES. 
Bond's face betrays the difficulty of what they're attempting.  The digital clock ticks down... 1:30, 1:29... 
OMITTED 217-218 
INT. PIPELINE - DAY 
The rigs speed through the tunnel. Nothing to see.  But WHOOSH!  As the rigs hurtle past... 
INT. ELECTRIC RIG - PIPELINE (TRAVELLING) - DAY 
The pipe suddenly dips.  They cling on as the machine bucks like a rollercoaster.  Back on a straight... 
Her brow furrows. 
CHRISTMAS The plutonium is missing.  They've taken the core! 
BOND Then it's no longer a bomb? 
CHRISTMAS (back to work, urgent) It's a bomb alright. We're still dead if the trigger charge goes off... 
Bond's mind races in the ghostly light of the tunnel. 
He stares at the timer:  0:44, 0:43...  Makes a decision. 
BOND Let it blow. 
Christmas shoots a look, astonished. 
CHRISTMAS But we can stop it. 
Taking her arm... 
BOND Let it blow. 
She can't believe what he's saying. His eyes shoot to an INSPECTION HATCH the lights illuminate up ahead. 
BOND Trust me.  Leave it. 
He grabs her, wrenches her away from the bomb. 
INT. PIPELINE - DAY 
The rig zooms past the exit hatch -- Bond leaps off, taking her with him.  They tumble along the pipe.  Agile, Bond springs to his feet, pulls her up.  They run like hell for the hatch, into the darkness... 
EXT. PIPELINE - DAY 
The pipeline.  A long beat, then... 
KABOOM!!  A section of the pipe explodes, debris rocketing in every direction. 
As the smoke clears we see a fifty yard section of pipe has been destroyed. 
OMIT 223 
INT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER - SAME 
On the consoles, red concentric circles pulse outward from the point of impact, emitting one, monotone BEEP.... 
The watchers are frozen, stunned, shocked. Gabor, a radio earpiece in his ear, reports information. 
GABOR It wasn't nuclear...the bomb was a dud. The trigger charge blew out a fifty yard section of pipeline... 
M And Bond? 
An agonizing beat. The alarm beep sputters and dies. 
GABOR Nothing. 
M and Elektra share a look. 
ELEKTRA Do you think he's dead? 
M can't answer.  She shakes her head. 
M We just have to wait.

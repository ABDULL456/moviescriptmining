DILLINGER .tell Billie... Only Charles Winstead hears the rest. 
PURVIS unloads Dillinger's gun. His gun-handling of Dillinger's gun is a lot better than his gun-handling of his own under stress. 
PURVIS What did he say? 
WINSTEAD I couldn't hear him. 
PURVIS You look after this. I need to call Washington. Zarkovich`houlders through the gathering crowd of 
PEDESTRIAN s=and newsmen, sees the head wound, the glazing over of Diflinger's eyes. He knows he's safe. 
JOHN DILLINGER'S EYES get dreamy, then they seem to focus far away. Then they seem to focus not at all. 
PURVIS (CONT'D) Cover his face and keep the damn photographers away. 
AERIAL: LINCOLN AVENUE Purvis starts away and we SEE the Biograph marquee, the trolley tracks in the cobblestone street, the alley, and the hundreds of people moving towards the locus of the dead John Dillinger. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANAL STREET DRY CLEANERS (NEW ORLEANS) - HOOVER - 
ANOTHER DAY watches Tolson who is at the window. Tolson gets a sign. Hoover straightens his collar. He brushes lint off his pants leg. Tolson waits. Hoover waits. 
EXT. CANAL STREET HOTEL - DOOR 
opens. Alvin Karpis comes out. In the hot, humid New Orleans air, his suit coat is off...he carries it under his arm. He crosses the street towards his Lincoln Coupe. His eyes land on a man on a bench across the street looking at him over a newspaper. And while crossing the street, Alvin slows down. 
THE MAN IS CHARLES WINSTEAD The newspaper hides a sawn-off, 10 gauge Winchester lever action shotgun. 
ALVIN LOOKS TO HIS LEFT: CLARENCE HURT leans on a lamp post. His body hides a 351 Winchester rifle. 
NOW ALVIN KARPIS freezes. He doesn't hesitate. He opens his hands to demonstrate he is holding nothing and lets his jacket; fall to the ground. He knows instantly who they are and that.,,they intend to kill him. Karpis' eyes dart to the roofto isÂ°. Snipers on both. In this instant, Karpis knows he is done. One objective races into his mind: stay alive. 
KARPIS' stretches out his arms, wide. Winstead has dropped the newspaper. The sawed-off 10 gauge is aimed squarely at Alvin's chest. Karpis is displaying he is unarmed. Winstead approaches warily step-by-step. His weapon would cut Alvin in half. Clarence, the rifle at his shoulder, inches forward. The ex-Texas Ranger gunfighters with real trigger-time have taken Alvin Karpis. 
ALVIN KARPIS I am unarmed. 
WINSTEAD Don't even breathe sudden. 
WINSTEAD Â± CAMPBELL + HURT are 10 feet from him. Clarence pats him down. Karpis is clean. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The Texans cover Alvin and move him to the sidewalk near his car. 
HURT Put your hands on the roof of that Lincoln. (he does) Other agents come running in. Someone's yelling: We got him! We got him. Bring him in." While they wait... 
WINSTEAD Where you from? 
ALVIN KARPIS Canada, but mostly Chicago. (to both) You? 
WINSTEAD Fort Worth, thereabouts. Clarence is from Tyler. 
(PAUSE) Well, Alvin. You're a sly old dog. If ,you'd a even had that jacket on... A ring ofc tints with their revolvers out, now converge around Karpis. 
HURT (to Agent) Any handcuffs around here? They don't have any. They had not planned on needing them. One agent is excited. His gun pointed at Karpis shakes. 
AL V I N KARP I S Mind asking that man to... 
HURT (to Agent) Put that down. The agent drops his gun. 
EXT. STREET - HOOVER 
in his white suit and Tolson rush in from the dry cleaners where they were stashed. The agents part. They suddenly stand in front of Alvin Karpis. Hoover's 38 Chief Special is at his side. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
TOLSON 
(PROMPTING) "You are under... 
HOOVER You are under arrest for the...Wahpeton, South Dakota bank robbery. Tolson waves to an agent across the street. 
WIDE ON THE CORNER: REPORTERS + PHOTOGRAPHERS are now released and rush towards us. 
HOOVER regains his composure. 
HOOVER (CONT'D) I heard of your fishing prowess. i myself, always wanted, to catch a marlin... 
ALVIN KARPIS You're thinking of my partner, Harry Campbell. 
HOOVER Are you relieved its over? I'm sure you are. 
(PAUSE) You know you will feel much better once you get everything off your chest. 
(PAUSE) Why don't you tell me where Harry Campbell is? After a moment.. 
ALVIN KARPIS Who do you think you're talking to? Hoover is silent.

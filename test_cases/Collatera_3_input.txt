slide past in a 400mm lens. Then, entering a plane of focus is VINCENT. He walks towards us...an arriving passenger. Suit. Shirt. No tie. Sunglasses and expensive briefcase say "confident executive traveler." The suit's custom-made but not domestic. His hair and shades are current, but it would be difficult to describe his identifying specifics...grey suit,        * white shirt, medium height. And that's the idea...                  * 
CLOSE BEHIND VINCENT 
OVER his left shoulder, walking through milling travelers           * towards the distant wall of metal and glass, sunlight streaming at him... 
ANOTHER BUSINESSMAN 
- suit, blonde crew cut - walks to camera. Same sunlight, but it hits him from the side. His trajectory is from the left. His eyeline is slightly right. Just now, he looks down at a ticket in his hand... 
OVER VINCENT'S LEFT SHOULDER... 
right now something catches Vincent's eye.   And the two men bump into each other... 
TWO-SHOT... 
VINCENT You okay?    Sorry... 
Vincent puts down his briefcase.   The man has a similar briefcase. 
MAN (North London working- class accent) Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, mate.   Enjoy                      * LA... 
VINCENT GRABS THE BRIEFCASE OF THE MAN 
with the North London working-class accent. And continues towards the exit. Was it an accident? Was it a brush pass? The Man's accent signified nothing to us except one thing: foreign origin. 
VINCENT 
approaches until he's in ECU...

OVERHEAD SHOT:   VINCENT 
up from the bottom of the frame, departs across the floor with the yellow tile, until we lose him into the milling hundreds of Angelenos, heading out into Greater LA and its eighteen million people.

Images wipe across the screen, kinetic and abstract, floating and dreamlike in SLO-MO: 
Shades of yellow.   Ribbons of silver.    Shimmers of chrome. 
Headlights sweeping past, flaring to white. Brake lights flashing, halating red. Reflections of overhead fluorescence flowing like liquid along windshield glass... 
SOUNDS are dreamlike and abstract, reverberated and discordant, bouncing off concrete walls: car doors OPENING and CLOSING. Brakes. A BABBLE of multi-lingual crosstalk. 
Racing Forms. A Farsi newspaper. African hands on a                  * Blackberry. Max's hands do The New York Times crossword. A           * West African speaks French into a cell phone. Metallica in a         * headset. Hip-hop, Norteno...                                         * 
Mechanics hands change tires, replace air cleaners, close a          * hood.                                                                * 
2    INT. TAXI DISPATCH - L.A. - DAY                                 2 
ORANGE and YELLOW FORD CROWN VICTORIAS are wiping screen. We         * find ourselves in a busy garage at change of shift. A balletic       * convergence of arriving and departing cars. One's door's flung open... 
3    INT. ONE CAB - MAX'S HANDS                                      3 
enter. They wipe the seats with paper towels and 409...a DMV LICENSE fitted into the small Lexan holder. On it is a picture of Max. 
Lights being checked. Indicators. Hazards. Switches. Similar to a pilot doing an aircraft check list. Fast. All fine. 
REVEAL NOW:   MAX'S BRIEFCASE                                        * 
He opens it, preparing for his workday. CD caddy of personal         * mixes goes on a visor. Spreadsheet peaks out a worn Mercedes         * S500 brochure, clipped open. A submarine sandwich from Subway.       *

LONG LENS:   OTHER CABBIES - OTHER FACES                                 * 
load-in. Southern California diversity - some unshaven,                  * swapping stories, counting cash, one stands on the passenger             * seat to shout over the roof to his pal, spills his coffee,               * couldn't care less...                                                    * 
Not Max.   His cab is fly.   Among cabbies he is GQ. 
And as CAR HORNS BLARE. AD LIB BANTER. CABBIES SHOUT.          Max gets behind the wheel, closes the door... 
4   INT. CAB - DAY                                                       4 
...and WHAM! The noise evaporates.    Welcome silence.     Max takes a moment to savor it.

He starts the engine.   RAP MUSIC BLARES from the radio.      Max turns it off. 
He dumps a CD into the changer. MOZART SONATA fills the cab. From the open briefcase, Max also pulls out one last thing... 
A TATTERED POSTCARD

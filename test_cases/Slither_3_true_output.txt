Grant approaches a cow. The cow makes a little MOO of protest when he gets too close, and steps back. 
The Grant-creature stabs one of his tentacle growths into the cow's neck, piercing it. The cow stumbles, choking. Blood spurts from her neck. And she topples over. 
INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT 
Bill and Wally stare out the window, motionless. 
WALLY What we gonna do now, Bill?   Cuffs won't even fit on 'im. 
Starla musters courage.   She stands, and moves out of the barn. 
BILL Starla, where you...? 
EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT 
Grant wraps a feeler around the cow's horns, and starts dragging it back in the direction of the forest. 
INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT 
Bill motions through the barn window to Margaret. 
EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT 
Margaret motions to Trevor. 
Trevor motions to the recruits. 
And Starla moves slowly in toward Grant. 
STARLA Grant? 
Grant turns and looks at her with his half-human eyes. His breathing is loud, raspy, and sick. He sees, in a wide circle around him, the nervous posse standing up, their guns at the ready. 
Starla moves even closer.   Bill and Wally are coming in close behind her. 
STARLA Grant?   It's okay. 
As Starla and the posse get closer, Grant looks almost scared. His eyes dart around from cop to cop. 
STARLA You're just sick is all. But we'll take you to get help right now. I'll stay by your side, Grant, just like I swore I would. For better or worse. Remember? 
Grant's huge milky eyes betray that he does. 
STARLA Okay? 
The posse inch in closer, tightening the circle. 
Grant lets out a PIERCING SCREECH of protest.    All of the posse stop, terrified. 
Everything is quiet and still except for Grant's gross breathing. Deep: In, out. 
STARLA Okay, Grant?    It's gonna be all right. 
Grant SCREECHES again: a warning. He looks from Starla to Bill, with hurt, jealous eyes, and GROWLS. 
Then Grant's eyes close to half-mast, and he turns away. His tentacle tightens around the cow's horns, and he again drags it toward the forest. 
While Bill tries to decide what to do, the Good Ol' Boy nervously blocks Grant's path. He aims his pistol at him. 
GOOD OL' BOY You stop right there, you son of a bitch. I don't care what kinda leprosy you got. We need to find that girl. Now you can make this peaceful, or you can make it hard. 
Pause.   Grant and the Good Ol' Boy stare at each other. 
And then Grant SNAPS out a tentacle-arm, whipping it up the front of the man's body, and back. 
The front of the Good Ol' Boy's whole body is split neatly in half. For a split second, he remains alive: the two different sides of his split head look down in disbelief as his organs spill out from inside him. And then he topples over. 
BILL Fire!   Fire! 
The posse SHOOT at Grant.    Starla covers her head. 
Grant is struck; he SCREECHES in pain. He lets go of the cow. He slithers with incredible speed off toward the forest. 
Bill and the other posse members take off after him like hounds on the heel of their prey. They SHOOT madly. 
Starla watches as the posse follows Grant into the woods. 
Starla stands alone and worried a moment, and then she darts off after them. 
INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Kylie is running a bath.    She hears GUNSHOTS ECHO in the distance.

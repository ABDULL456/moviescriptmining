HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT The following is shot DOCUMENTARY-STYLE. A GIRLS VOLLEYBALL GAME has just ended. It was a big game. Some kind of championship. \nONE TEAM is CELEBRATING -- jumping up and down, squealing and hugging each other. We are focused on the bench of the TEAM TRAT LOST. They're very sad -- several are crying. One girl, in particular, (AMY) is really sobbing. She's sweat- stained, tired and just blubbering. Stuff's coming out of her eyes, her nose, her mouth and the camera is seeing it all. \nThe COACH, a fortyish man looks at all the weeping girls -- Amy in particular. \nCOACH You quit! You gave up! \nHe KICKS a CHAIR. \nNow Amy is really a mess. She's crying, coughing, shaking. \nCOACH (CONT'D) (right in Amy's face) You quit!! \nThe Coach storms off. \nCOACH (CONT'D) Qutters! ... Quitters! \nAmy is wailing and choking on her own tears. \nThis IMAGE FREEZES. \nTERRY (V.O.) And that would be it. I don't think you need any narration at all. Just end it right there. \nREVEAL \n2\tINT. OFFICE - DAY BEGIN CREDITS \nWe're in New York City. We're in the conference room of a modestly successful cable TV station called \"Real TV.\" The people are young, energetic, clever. It's crowded, noisy -the furniture is beaten up, bulletin boards cover the walls, with large index cards all over them. This room is not for show -- work gets done here. \nSEVEN OR EIGHT PEOPLE are present. One of them is CYNTHIA REED. She's the boss. \nTERRY (to Cynthia) What do you think? \nCYNTHIA It's horrible, it's depressing, I love it. What else? \nALICE I want to re-pitch that pregnancy idea. Find six women early in their pregnancies and follow them all right through to the births. \nKEITH (negative) Yeah, when all that stuff comes out. \nMixed reactions, mostly negative. \nCYNTHIA I have an idea. \nIMMEDIATE ATTENTION \nCYNTHIA (CONT'D) This is something I've been thinking about for a long time. We're \"Real TV\" right? I mean that's the name of the station. \nAGREEMENT \nCYNTHIA (CONT'D) So let's go real. We find someone. Just a regular person, someone. And we put their life on television - live... all day long. \nSilence. No movement at all. \nCYNTHIA (CONT'D) Calm down. \nKEITH What do you mean, like PBS did in the seventies? What was that family? \nGREG The Louds. \nKEITH Yeah. \nCYNTHIA No. We go way beyond that. We don't film it and edit it and put it on later. We go on the air live every morning and the show goes off each night, when our subject goes to bed. In between, we're on live all day, every day - the same person, -- for (shrugs) let's say a month. \nNo one is wild for this. Some hate it -- some are unconvinced. \nFELICIA That's not a show that's a surveillance camera. \nGREG You can't do that. \nCYNTHIA The hell we can't. Look, the beauty of being a cable channel is we can take chances. I've thought about this and I'm telling you, I think this can make a noise. A loud one. There are twelve thousand channels. You've got to do something that says \"Look at me!\" Hell, people look at fish tanks all day. This is people! (more firmly) Someone's real life -- an TV, all day long - live... And, you know what? I'm doing it. \nPause. The others know the argument is over. \nGREG In that case, we love it. \nEND CREDITS \n3\tEXT. POOL HALL - DAY A BUS passes. On the bus is an ad. It says, \"Would you like to star in your own TV show? Call Real TV (and a phone number) Coming (and a date).\" \n4\tINT. POOL HALL - NIGHT - PARAMUS NEW JERSEY This is a nice upscale pool hall. A party is in progress in a special private area -- a room upstairs let's say -- a loft. Thirty or forty PEOPLE in their twenties and thirties are informally celebrating the engagement of two of their friends. \nED My sister -- Marcia, I mean she can't get a break. About seven years ago she falls in love with this Vietnamese guy who wants to marry her so he can stay in the country. So they get married, they have a kid, he gets his citizenship, immediately divorces my sister and marries this Vietnamese woman who, he was probably already married to all along. She can pick 'em. (pause) She's got a nice little boy, though. My nephew, Andy. \nCUT TO: \n11C   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER \nED My Mom's okay. Kinda. I knew a guy who hated his mother - Stuey Shwam. He hated his mother so much, he had his belly button removed. \nCUT TO: \n11D   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER \nED No, I've never been married. \nThe interviewer seems to be waiting for him to elaborate. He doesn't. He shrugs -- that's it. \nCUT TO: \n11E   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER \nED Oh, my father -what an asshole. When I was twelve, my mother needed a hysterectomy -- my father ran off with her nurse! And that's the last I heard of him. \nCUT TO: \n11F   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER \nED Al, my stepfather he's opinionated. And you have to listen because he's like in a wheelchair. \nCUT TO: \n11G   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER \nED I like my job -- I mean I'm doing all right. I'm not sure how long I want to stay there, you know... I mean, I'm thirty-one... I'm not sure I want to be a video store clerk when I'm forty... Of course, I didn't expect to be doing it 'til I was thirty-one, either. But... you know I'm... keeping my options open. Anything comes along, I'm ready to pounce. (growls like a cougar) \nCUT TO: \n11H   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER \nED A dream? Of course I have a dream I just don't know what the hell it is. (shrugs and smiles) \nEd's image freezes, while he has a funny-cute expression on his face. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL a TV in a conference room with Ed's frozen image on it. Cynthia is there with her bosses, the people who run the network that owns Real TV. The top man is MR. SCHARLACH. His deputies are MS. SEAVER and MR. McILVAINE. This is not the same place where we met Cynthia and her staff. This is richer, more corporate and formal. \nCYNTHIA He's who we want to go with. \nSCHARLACH (doubtfully) This guy. \nCYNTHIA I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable. \nSCHARLACH I'm not sure about the entire concept. \nCynthia is frustrated. \nCYNTHIA Look it's not like we're burning up the airwaves now. We're running neck-and-neck with The Gardening Channel. If people just tune in to this twice a day for five minutes, we're a hit. Plus we can sell advertising every second, running at the bottom of the screen... and the beauty is this guy doesn't even have to be good. I mean if he's good, great. But if he winds up making an ass of himself, better. \nMcILVAINE How is that better? \nCYNTHIA Come on. People cannot turn away from an accident. You drive by, you say \"Ooh, I hope there's not a head lying in the road\" but you look ! See, nobody in America wants to be nobody. This guy wants to be famous. So, basically, the deal is he agrees to drive down the highway a hundred miles an hour blindfolded and we get to see if his head winds up rolling down the highway. Fun for the whole family. So let's do it. \nShe stops, waiting for approval. \n12    INT. VIDEO STORE \nSCHARLACH (coldly) Good luck. \nEd's RE-STOCKING the SHELVES \nHe gets goosed from behind \nRAY (O.C.) (very loud and happy) Hey... \nED (goosed) Oh! \nEd DROPS the BOXES. Ray is there with Shari. \nRAY I got your message. Way to go! \nED Hi, Shari. (to Ray) Let's go in the stockroom. \n13    INT. STOCKROOM Ed and Ray enter. \nRAY So when do you start? \nED I ... I'm not gonna do it. \nRAY What? \nED Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just... \nRAY (disgusted) Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you! \nHe slaps a tape off a shelf. \nRAY That's the point -- this could change things. \nMARCIA How? \nRAY For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear. \nMARCIA (points to Ed) What does that have to do with... ? \nRAY If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment. \nEd nods. \nPause. \nRAY (CONT'D) I borrow against that now, at the bank. Buy the business. And Ed becomes a silent partner. Now here's the beauty part. While we're on TV I plug the shit out of the business. Free advertising. \nAL How about sex? \nA STUNNED pause. They all look at Al. \nED I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing -- \nAL No! Do they show you having sex? \nED No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away. \nAL At what point? \nED At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me. \nWE HEAR: A loud drilling sound. \nCUT TO: \n15    INT. ED'S APARTMENT - DAY A WORKMAN is drilling a hole in the wall. \nEd is there with a TV CREW. They're running cable and drilling holes and examining the apartment. \nCynthia is going around supervising. Ray and Shari are there. Ray is fascinated. Ed is tense. Shari is observant. Ray separates from Ed and Shari and asks one of the Installers a technical question. \nSHARI AND ED \nEd thinks. \nEd joins Cynthia. \nSHARI Are you sure about this? \nED Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here. \nSHARI Why do it? \nED I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ? \nSHARI Cream rinse? \nED (laughs) Dynamite. \nSHARI So? \nED So maybe this is my dynamite. \nSHARI Dynamite is dangerous. \nCYNTHIA Ed, can I see you a second. \nED (to Shari) Excuse me. \nCYNTHIA Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you. \nED (overwhelmed) Cool. \nCYNTHIA I want you to take this. \nShe gives him a card. \nCYNTHIA (CONT'D) That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay? \nED (barely listening) Um, yeah -- thanks. \nEd looks kind of overwhelmed. She doesn't like this. \nCYNTHIA Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you? \nED No, uh... \nCYNTHIA I bet my career on you. You'd better be good. \nED (annoyed) Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that. \nCYNTHIA I do. \nEd reacts. \n30    INT. OFFICE \nKEITH Somebody shoot me. \n31    INT. NETWORK OFFICE Scharlach, Seaver and McIlvaine watching, grim-faced. \n32    INT. OFFICE Cynthia is ON the PHONE. \nCYNTHIA Get him out of the house! I want him moving! \n33    INT. CONTROL TRUCK \nDIRECTOR (on the phone) Hey, I want him dead, but what can I do. \n34    INT. KITCHEN Ed is EATING. He peers confused at the camera. \nANGLE ON \nCAMERA OPERATORS. They're signaling Ed to get out. \nANGLE ON ED \nBewildered, imitating their gestures. \nED What... You want me to swim? \n35    INT. CONTROL TRUCK The Director is still on the phone. She's watching Ed on a monitor. \nDIRECTOR Oh God... \nEd gets it. \nED Oh, out? You want me to go out. \n36    EXT. BUILDING Ed exits the building with the Operators walking backwards in front of him, bumping into PEOPLE- People watch, curiously. \nEd reaches his car. He takes out his keys and drops them in a muddy puddle. Disgusted, he fishes them out. \nCUT TO: \n36A   INT. NETWORK BUILDING Scharlach, watching impassively. \nCUT TO: \n36B   INT. ED'S CAR Ed, in the car. He can barely fit the key into the ignition. Carlos, in the passenger seat taps him on the arm. Ed looks up. Carlos holds up a hastily-made sign. \"It's okay. Relax, man.\" Carlos WINKS. This does help Ed. He appreciates it. He drives. \nWE SEE the control truck in motion. We also see another car with another Steady-cam OPERATOR, shooting Ed's car as they travel. \n37    EXT. STREET - MONTAGE Ed is doing his morning errands. A little shopping -- a little banking -- always ON CAMERA. At one point, he WALKS INTO a GLASS DOOR with the word \"Pull\" on it. He pushed, banging his forehead. A CHILD points to the word \"Pull.\" Ed turns to the camera, embarrassed. Later he buys a slice of pizza at a little place that's doing no business. \nED (to the camera) Best pizza in New Jersey. \nAs he walks down the street, PEOPLE call out \"Hey Ed!\" People in windows show him that they're watching him at that exact moment. \nThe camera shoots some of the people in the windows. They see themselves on TV and they go wild. Ed also is confronted by GUYS grabbing their crotches mockingly, calling out things like \"Hey, Ed, holding your own?\" or \"Hey, Ed, howls the grand ballroom.\" Ed is slightly chagrined by all this, but handles it with good grace. He seems to be loosening up. \n38    INT. VIDEO STORE - DAY Ed arrives at work. The store is already open. (Ed usually gets there in the afternoon and stays until closing.) CUSTOMERS are a little stunned by the arrival of a camera. Some know what it's about some don't. \nThe CLERKS are aware of what's going on. They all signed releases. Ed's BOSS greets him stiffly. Clearly he's trying to get face-time on camera. \nED Hey, Lou. \nLOU (stiffly) Welcome to work, Ed. \nHe shakes Ed's hand and smiles at the camera. He WAVES a little. \nThe BROOM GUY crosses, staring transfixed at the camera. He blocks Ed and Lou. He FREEZES, then panics. He tries to get out of the way and trips over his broom. He tumbles face-first into the camera lens, hurting himself. \nANGLE ON ED, observing. \nED (mutters) Oh, Jesus, I'm dying. \n39    INT. CONTROL TRUCK \nDIRECTOR Carlos, give him some air, give him some room. Use a longer lens. We'11 mostly go with the stationary cameras in here. Less intrusive. (to the crew in the truck, sarcastically) Have any of you thought about your next career? \n40    INT. A KITCHEN - SAME TIME A WOMAN is serving dinner. She's watching Ed on TV -- really just glancing at it. Her HUSBAND is helping her bring the food to the table. \nHUSBAND Why are we watching this? \nWIFE (a little guilty) No reason. just... I just want to see what happens. \nHUSBAND Nothing's gonna happen. He's just... working. \nWIFE Oh, come on, they wouldn't put it on if nothing was gonna happen. \nHe changes the channel. She changes it back. He doesn't get it at all. \nRAPID CUTS of VARIOUS PEOPLE around America, watching -- A couple, a young guy, a woman alone -- ending with a few college-age girls in what appears to be a dorm room. \nONE GIRL is watching intently. Her roommates are mostly just hanging around not really watching. \nCOLLEGE GIRL I think he's cute. \nJEANETTE Who? \nBACK TO BAR \nRAY He's living with her! \nED (camera-conscious) Ray, maybe this isn't ... \nRAY No, this is great. (to the camera) You'll love this. (to Ed) He's a singer. \nED Marcia's living with a singer? \nCUT TO: \nRAY Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met. \nSHARI He sang to her and they fell in love? \nRAY (enjoying this) No! Some drunk hit him over the head with his snifter -- you know, that thing they keep on the piano for tips -- and Marcia yanked a big hunk of glass out of his head. (cracks up, pounds the table) \n48    INT. MARCIA'S APARTMENT Marcia is staring at the TV in UNHAPPY SHOCK. Next to her is a good- looking, but slightly sleazy-looking GUY with a bandage on his head. \n49    INT. BAR \nRAY I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place? \nED Ray -- \nRAY She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake. \nED Oh, Jesus. \nMarcia, watching, HORRIFIED. \nBACK TO BAR \nRAY Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name? \nED What's the dif -- \nRAY Richie! (to Shari) She spent six months dating a criminal \nED (to Shari) She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They -- \nRAY \"Quick pull off the highway\" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee. \nHe KISSES Shari. She COVERS her FACE with her hand. \nRAY (CONT'D) What are you, hiding from the Police? (pulls her hands down) Show your face, you look great. (to Ed) Doesn't she look great. \nED Great. \nRAY (to Ed) While I'm gone, tell them about our cousin Lenny who's gay. We knew from when he was five. \nHe minces off' effeminately, to the bathroom, LAUGHING. It's like a hurricane has just passed through. Everyone is sitting, STUNNED. \nED You do though, you look great. \nSHARI Right. \nED No, no, I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, \"Boy Shari looks beautiful.\" I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it. \nShe LAUGHS. They smile at each other. They make intermittent eye-contact a little self-consciously. \nEd finally looks somewhere else and Shari, for just a moment, stares right at him. \nPULL BACK to TWO GUYS, watching this on TV in a bar -- more of a neighborhood bar. \n50    INT. BAR - NIGHT \nTAD Did you see that? \nBARRY What? \nTAD Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother. \nBARRY You're nuts. \nTAD Okay, I'm nuts. \nCUTS OF OTHER VIEWERS, \nWATCHING REAL TV \nA BEDROOM \nThe COUPLE we met earlier are in bed, the wife is holding the remote. \nHUSBAND Give me the remote. \nWIFE Just a few more minutes. Read your book. \nA LIVING ROOM \nED He's just ... trying a little too hard -- \nCYNTHIA Ed, the audience can smell the desperation coming through the screen. \nTERRY Could you... see him a little less often? \nED How much less? \nFELICIA Never would be plenty. \nED I can't do that to him. He's pushing a little too hard - but... I just can't do that to him. \nSILENCE \nED (CONT'D) He'11 be fine. \n59    INT. CAR - DAY \"DAY FIVE\" \nEd is driving slowly on a busy street. Suddenly an EIGHTEEN YEAR-OLD BOY lands heavily on Ed's windshield. Ed is badly startled. He can't see. He swerves and stops. The boy is not hurt. He's banging on the windshield, waving at the camera. Ed, furious, gets out. \n60    EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS \nED What the --?! \nBOY I'm on TV! I'm on TV! \nEd just stares in disbelief. \n61    EXT. STREET - LATER Ed is walking. PEOPLE YELL at him. \nGUY Ed! Your show stinks! \nThe Guy LAUGHS like he really got in a good one. Ed ignores him. \nTWO TEENAGERS run in, one has a camera and quickly snaps a picture of Ed and the other Guy. Merrily, they shake his hand and run off, whooping. \nThere are PEOPLE who trail along. Many of them will show up again and again, throughout the movie, following Ed. Some of them will look mentally or emotionally impaired. \n62    INT. VIDEO STORE - NIGHT QUICK SHOTS of Ed with CUSTOMERS - One or two show a bit of camera-consciousness. A little group has gathered to observe Ed's \"show\". \n63    INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY- NIGHT Ed rings the bell. \nED (to the camera) This is Ray's apartment. Ray's got a big-screen TV and the Knicks are playing in L.A. tonight, so sometimes I come over after I work late and we watch the game here. He makes funny comments. He's really a good guy. He just... \nRAY (O.C.) Who is it? \nED It's me, Ed. \nThe door opens a crack, revealing Ray in a bathrobe. Ray's look is unwelcoming. \nRAY Hi. \nED You watching the ballgame? \nRAY Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep. \nED Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then. \nRAY Yeah... \nWOMAN (O.C.) Ray, where do you keep the glasses? \nED Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired? \nED (CONT'D) (calls out) Hi, Shari. \nWOMAN (O.C.) Who's Shari? \nED Who's -- \nRay looks pained. Ed realizes what's happening and freezes Ray's phone RINGS. \nRAY Oh shit... \nHe turns to answer his phone, allowing the door to swing open a little. Ed can see into the kitchen. He sees a WOMAN, wearing just panties, facing away from him, searching for glasses. \nRAY (into phone) Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God! \nED (to the camera) We'd better go... \nRAPID CUTS of VIEWERS loving this, some screaming \"Don't go!, don't leave, stay\" etc. \nBACK TO SCENE \nRAY (into phone) No, honey, it's not what it looks like-- \nShe hangs up on him. He holds his head. \nRAY Oh God ... Ed! \n64    INT. HALLWAY Ed is TIP-TOEING away. He stops when Ray calls him. Ray 'runs out into the hallway after him. They speak with lowered voices. \nRAY That was Shari. She saw the whole thing on TV-- \nJEANETTE (O.C.) No. It's a mess. \nED Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you. \nAfter a pause, Jeanette enters, very camera-conscious. \nED (CONT'D) (to the camera) This is my mother. \nSTIFFLY, he gives her a kiss. \nED (CONT'D) Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and -- \nJEANETTE Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend. \nED Hey, he cheated on her. \nJEANETTE He made a mistake. \nED I don't want to -- do you know where he is? \nJEANETTE No. Maybe he's watching. (indicates the camera) Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl. \nED No! And that girl has a name. \nAL What do you love her or something? \nED (embarrassed) Come on... \nAL (teasing) Look at your face. I had a car that color. \nVARIOUS REACTIONS OF VIEWERS really liking this. \nBACK TO SCENE \nJEANETTE I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy. \nED No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay? \nHe KISSES her again. \nED (CONT'D) How's Marcia? She all right? \nJEANETTE I don't know. She's living with that \"entertainer\"... \nED (trying to make his mother feel better) Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time. \nJEANETTE (unconvinced) Mm. \nED You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left. \nJEANETTE (looks at the TV) Oh my God! \nED I mean, that worked out. \nJEANETTE Oh my God!! \nShe gets in the closet and closes the door. \n92    INT. OFFICE \nED (to the camera) I think we're through here. \nThe Real TV group is there. They're smiling. Cynthia is ON the PHONE \nCYNTHIA (into phone) I will. I'11 tell them. (hangs up) That was Scharlach. All of you, scrub your asses. He's coming over to kiss them. \nThey all WHOOP and LAUGH. \n93    INT. SHARI'S APARTMENT - DAY Shari and Rita are watching Ed leave his parents house on TV. Rita is very excited. Shari is ON the PHONE. \nSHARI (into phone) Um, I'd like to get a new phone number, please... Because I'm getting calls from every nut case in America... Right, unlisted... Sure. (she holds) \nRITA Aren't you excited? He said he loved you on television! \nSHARI He didn't say it. His stepfather said it. \nRITA (joking) Well, the stepfather's cute... Seriously, how do you feel about Ed? \nPause. \nSHARI I think he's great. He just makes me feel... oh, I'm really gonna get hurt, this time - Hello ... \nCUTS OF VARIOUS VIEWERS WATCHING REAL TV \nEnd on TAD and BARRY in a health club. This is the refreshment area. They've played racquetball and they're sweaty. They're watching Real TV. \nTAD I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die. \nBARRY What do you mean \"they're gonna have him die?\" \nTAD You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing. \nBARRY This is real, Bananahead! \nED Isn't she great? I mean, maybe just to me, but... I don't know, she's just -- \nTERRY (impatiently) She's great, she's great. Why didn't you go see her? \nED I wanted to! I was dying to! But... \nGREG Is it Ray? (pulls out research) The audience hates Ray. Females, 18 to 35 -- \nED No, I don't need to hear that. Cynthia? \nCYNTHIA Yes, Ed. \nED Could we just talk alone for a second? I -- \nCYNTHIA Good idea. (to her staff) Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes? \nShe PANTOMIMES for them to stay in the room, but be quiet. The staff scrape chair legs and feign movement and ad lib \"Bye Ed\", \"See you, buddy\" etc. They all stay. \nCYNTHIA (CONT'D) How you doing, Ed? \nED I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants. \nCYNTHIA (no clue) Uh-huh? \nED And all the kids stared calling me \"Pumpkin Ass.\" \"Hey Pumpkin Ass,\" -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm \"Pumpkin Ass\" again. \nThe staff are stifling giggles. \nCYNTHIA Can I tell you something? I think you are fantastic. I think you have taken an idea and turned it into something explosive. \nThe staff stifle laughter. One of the guys is doing a jerk-off gesture. Cynthia gives them the finger. \nED Yeah? \nCYNTHIA Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari? \nED Sure. \nCYNTHIA A woman wants to be pursued. \n96    EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - DAY Shari, in her Fed-ex uniform is making a delivery. A WOMAN's signing for it. \nWOMAN This is so exciting! A real celebrity delivering my figs. \nSHARI (uncomfortable) Sign here, please. \nWOMAN That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey. \nSHARI By the X. \nWOMAN Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out. \nSHARI What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this? \nWOMAN (insulted) Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude. \nSHARI (annoyed) By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X. \nANGRILY, the Woman signs and slams the door. \nShe heads back to her truck. She looks up and Ed is there with flowers. The TV cameras are there also. Shari is startled. But she's also glad to see him. \nSHARI What are you doing? \nED I missed you. \nShe's camera-shy. \nED (CONT'D) You know, I never saw you in your uniform before. \nSHARI Yeah, well... \nThey both LAUGH. \nED It's really a tremendous turnoff. \nSHARI You should see the one we wear when it rains. \nED Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni. \nSHARI The what? \nED You know, the big machine that cleans the ice. \nSHARI Oh yeah. \nED It's quite an honor. Will you come with me? \nShe looks at the camera. \nED (CONT'D) (gently) Look, I know this is weird. But... I don't want to wait. I really think we might have something together. Don't you? \nEMBARRASSED, she nods. \nICE CREAM GUY Watch this! Like Ed. \nHe slices a banana the way Ed does. \nWOMAN #2 I just kind of leave it an, you know, so it's... there. \nTHREE TEEN-AGE GIRLS \nTEEN-AGER #l I don't like Shari. She's ... needy. \nTEEN-AGER #2 I like her. She's sweet. \nTEEN-AGER #1 She just rubs me the wrong way. \nTEEN-AGER #3 I'm so glad they got rid of Ray. He was creepy. \nCUT TO: \nYOUNG GUYS \nGUY #1 To me, this Shari is like nothing. \nGUY #2 She's not even hot. I mean Ed's a celebrity. If that was me, I'd be dating the goods. \nGUY #1 There's something wrong with her. She's definitely not hot. \nGUY #2 Not hot. Not. \n107   INT. SHARI'S APARTMENT She's watching this, wearing a bathrobe. Her self-esteem is being crushed. \n108   INT. TV STUDIO This is an \"E TV\" kind of gossip show. The host -- a YOUNG WOMAN -- is showing film of Ed and Shari getting out of Ed's car. The film freeze-frames. Shari has an unflattering look on her face. \nGOSSIP QUEEN What's wrong with her! Everytime you look at this chick, it's like she badly needs a Tampax. Ed, you can do better. \nShari watching, in horror. \n109   INT. DELICATESSAN - NIGHT Ed and Shari are on a date. A WAITRESS is taking their order. Shari still seems a little self-conscious, but Ed is having a ball. \nED I'11 have... (to Shari) Get this -- (to the waitress) I'11 have the \"Ed.\" \nSHARI I'm stunned. \nA WOMAN with her young SON approach. \nWOMAN Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph. \nED No problema. (to the boy) You want a picture? \nThe boy nods. \nED (CONT'D) Moe. \nMOE, the Bodyguard, in the next booth hands Ed a glossy of Ed and a pen. Ed signs it. \nED (CONT'D) Take this around the corner to Frame World, they'll give you a discount. \nThe Woman and Child leave. \nED (CONT'D) (to Shari) Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out. \nSHARI (ironic) That's lucky. \nED Saturday, I think we should \nA PHONE RINGS \nEd takes a phone out of his pocket. \nED (CONT'D) (plugging) Compliments of Motorola. Hello... Marcia?? (to Shari) My sister. -- What? ... What, right now? ... I'm eating, I'm on a date! ... Well, where's your boyfriend -- what's his name? Cliff .... Then, call a cab... (wearily) All right. Look, just don't start any trouble okay. Just sit there quietly 'til I get there... you're welcome. \nHe HANGS UP. He's disgusted. \n110   INT. CAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nED This used to be a regular thing. And the worst part, is while she'd be waiting for me to come down to some bar and get her, she'd start up with some guy and say \"Wait 'til my brother gets here, he'11 kick your ass.\" So then I walk in and there's some rhinoceros in a windbreaker who tries to shove me into a shot glass. And Marcia's drunk and screaming \"Kick his ass, Ed. Kick his ass.\" (looks out) I think this is it. \n111   INT. BAR It's not a seedy dive. Ed and Shari and the camera operators enter. A CUSTOMER approaches. \nCUSTOMER Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You're the guy on TV. \nED What was the tip-off? The enormous camera? \nCUSTOMER Watch this. \nThe guy does Ed's \"Happy Dance.\" \nCUSTOMER (CONT'D) See, like you. \nED Yeah. Keep up the good work. \nEd brushes by him. He sees a WOMAN passed out at a table. \nED (CONT'D) Oh great. \nThe guys who said she wasn't hot. \nThey applaud. \nTHE DORM GIRLS \nThey're booing Shari. \nA BAR \nA very attractive woman (JILL) and her friend. \nJILL That girl's an idiot. \nBACK TO ED AND SHARI \nED What?... Why? \nSHARI (starting to weep) I can't take it anymore... \nGUYS WHO DON'T THINK SHE'S HOT \nThey mock her, crying \"Boo hoo hoo\" and pretending to rub their eyes. \nBACK TO ED AND SHARI \nSHARI (crying) I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month! \nED Shari... \nSHARI Everybody hates me! \nED No. Who? \nSHARI Look at this. \nShe picks up a N.Y. POST. \nSHARI (CONT'D) Page three of the Post. \nED (knows what it is) Ohh... \nSHARI A poll. \"Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?\" Seventy-one per cent said \"no.\" (crying) They hate me! \nED Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care. (to the camera) Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... (he can't do the math) \nSHARI Twenty-nine. \nED Exactly. Boy, you're smart. (to the camera) Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you? (picks up newspaper) \"Is she good enough for Ed?\" Who the hell am I? (sarcastically) Who the hell do you think I should be dating? \nSHARI There's a list. \nED Really? (he looks) \nSHARI Ed? \nHe doesn't hear her. He's scanning the list. \nED Wow... \n114   INT. DAVID LETTERMAN SHOW (OR SOMETHING) Ed is a guest. \nDAVE I'm out here an hour a night and I feel like a dork. You're on every minute! Doesn't it just drive you nuts? \nED (cheerfully) Yeah. \nLAUGHS. \nDAVE All this fame and the money you're making. Is this going to change you, do you think? \nED God, I hope so. \nBIGGER LAUGHS. \n115   INT. GREEN ROOM - LATER It's after the show. Ed is getting ready to leave. John is with him, keeping him company. A. P.A. is giving Ed a bag of gifts. (Of course, Ed is still on Ed TV.) \nPRODUCTION ASSISTANT You've got a ham in there and Dave's book and -- \nED Hey, if it's free, it's me. (to John) You ready? \nJOHN Yeah. You did good. What's wrong? \nED Aah, I wanted Shari to come. \nJOHN Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute? \nHe KISSES John. \nED (easily) Yeah. (to the camera) Honey, if you're watching this is for you. \nJOHN No! Don't -- (new subject) Oh, wow. \nED What? \nED (CONT'D) Let's see. \nEd stares and his smile disappears. \nANGLE ON THE MAIL \nA picture of Ed's face with his body drawn underneath it. The body is spurting blood and is mutilated. Ed stares at it. \nED Well. This is creative. This goes in the psychopath pile. \nThe DOORBELL RINGS. \nED Oh, I hope that's not this guy. (indicates psycho letter) \nHe PICKS UP a baseball bat and crosses to the door. \nHe opens the door. A handsome man in his early sixties is there. His name is HANK. \nHANK Hello. \nED Hi. \nEd waits. \nHANK You don't recognize me. \nED No. Am I supposed to? \nHank shrugs. Ed stares at him, then begins to look a little shaken. \n121   INT. EWS MOTHER'S HOUSE Jeanette is putting a jar in the refrigerator. She glances at the television. She drops the jar. It SHATTERS... \n122   INT. MARCIA'S APARTMENT Marcia is with her half-Asian son ANDY. She's serving his dinner. OFF-CAMERA we HEAR Cliff SINGING and the DOG HOWLING in distress. Glancing at the television, Marcia gasps. \n123   INT. RAY'S APARTMENT Ray is TYPING on a word processor. He stares curiously at the television. \n124   INT. ED'S APARTMENT Ed is staring at Hank doubtfully. \nHANK It's me, Hank -- your father. \nRAPID CUTS of VIEWERS, excited. Many of them reach for the phone. \n125   INT. REAL TV OFFICE The Real TV staff react. Cynthia looks over-- stunned. \nALICE (to Cynthia) Did you do this? Did you find him and get him to-- \nCYNTHIA No way... Oh, this just keeps getting better. \n126   INT. AL AND JEANETTE'S HOUSE - DAY Written on the screen -- \"Day 35\" \nEd and his mother are arguing. Al is sucking oxygen and has a pile of \"People\" magazines with Ed on the cover. A REPAIRMAN is fixing the refrigerator. All their food is out and melting. \nJeanette is trying to preserve food in an ice chest while she argues with Ed. \nJEANETTE I can't believe you're taking his side. \nED I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts. \nAL (to Ed) Sign this one to Nancy. She's the nurse who handles my urine. \nEd signs. \nJEANETTE I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts. \nED So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything. \nAl takes a loud breath. \nJEANTETTE Yes! ... practically \nED What do you mean practically? Did he really run away or did you throw him out like he says. \nREPAIRMAN I need to replace the coil. \nJEANETTE (to Ed) He ran away after I threw him out. (to repairman) How much is a new coil? \nREPAIRMAN A hundred and fifty bucks. \nED So he was telling the truth you threw him out. \nREPAIRMAN Should I go ahead? \nJEANETTE Yes. \nED Yes to me or yes to the coil? \nJEANETTE Both. \nED Holy sh-- \nAL This one to Dr. Bamajian. Maybe he won't make me wait an hour. \nEd signs. \nHe wants it accomplished. \n139   EXT. STREET - DAY \nSEAVER (CONT'D) It's in violation of his contract and if we wanted to be hard-nosed about it, he could forfeit all pay, including money he's already received. \nCYNTHIA (dutifully, but a tad resentfully) I will see that he's properly threatened. \nSCHARLACH Now what? What's on the young man's agenda? We don't want to see him sitting around like a lovesick puppy. \nGREG Young males do not want to see Ed get back with Shari. \nSCHARLACH (impatiently) Enough with her. That sailed. \nMcILVAINE Could Ed live with two girls? \nGREG You know who the audience is requesting a lot? That girl, Jill, that Ed met at the Letterman show. She really scored. \nSCHARLACH Cynthia... \nHe wants it accomplished. \n139   EXT. STREET - DAY Ed is walking from his car to a building. CROWDS are behind barricades. They YELL at Ed as he passes. Ed is used to this. \n140   INT. SHARI'S BUILDING - DAY Rita OPENS the door and sees Ed. \nRITA (nervously) Oh. Ed. \nED Hi. Is Shari here? \nRITA No. \nED What is she, at work? \nRITA She left. \nED Well, when will she be back? \nRITA She won't. \nED What are you talking about? \nRITA She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself. \nED I'm sorry. Where'd they send her? \nRITA She wouldn't tell me. \n141   INT. ED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT He's off the air. He's a little down. He's ON the PHONE- \nINTERCUT WITH: \n142   INT. CYNTHIA'S BEDROOM She's working out an a contraption. \nED Remember when you were interviewing me? (details to follow) \n143   EXT. PARK - DAY \nCYNTHIA Yeah. \nED You asked me if I had a dream. I said \"Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet.\" \nCYNTHIA Great line. \nED What if Shari's the dream? \nCYNTHIA Ed, do you want my advice? \nED Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved -- \nCYNTHIA Leave her be. \nED You said a woman likes to be pursued. \nCYNTHIA Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something -- as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth. \nOPEN ON ANDY, Ed's half-Asian nephew. He's eight. He's wearing a baseball glove. \nANDY Throw me a high one, Uncle Eddie. \nED (O.C.) Okay. \nREVEAL ED, also wearing a baseball glove. He throws a high pop up to Andy. Andy staggers around and almost catches it. \nED Oh!! \nJILL (0.C.)

MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT There is no line. At TICKET TAKER sits, bored. No one is going in or coming out. \n147   EXT. STREET It's deserted. \n148   EXT. RESTAURANT It's empty. The HEADWAITER stands in the doorway with nothing to do. \n149   INT. LIVING ROOM A PARTY is in progress. The TV is on. On TV Ed is in a liquor store, buying a bottle of wine. Ed is dressed for his date. The people at the party are watching TV and commenting. It's like a Super bowl party. \nVOICE (O.C.) What's he doing? \nPARTYGOER He's buying wine! \n150   INT. BEDROOM Several high-school age BOYS. They have made themselves look like Ed. They're very excited. \nTEEN-AGE BOY #1 You think he's gonna do it? \nTEEN-AGE BOY #2 Hell yeah. The guy hasn't had any sex in six weeks. \nTEEN-AGE BOY #3 Neither have we. \n151   EXT. STREET Ed's car turns the corner and he sees a CROWD gathered around Jill's building. \n152   EXT. BUILDING \nED (understating) I'm starting to feel a little pressure. \nEd carrying his wine enters to APPLAUSE and CHEERS. \n153   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET A LONG SHOT encompasses all the houses on the block. Their living room TV's are visible. All but one are tuned to Ed. \n154   INT. JILL'S KITCHEN Something is cooking. Jill picks up a plate of something - dip and cut vegetables for instance. She starts to exit the kitchen as Ed and Carlos enter. Ed and Jill have a soft collision. \nJILL Oh. \nED Can I help with anything? \nJILL No. It's going to be about a half-hour. \nED What is? Oh, dinner! \nSELF-CONSCIOUSLY. He takes a vegetable, dips it and eats it. \nED (CONT'D) Mm. \nJILL Good? \nED Mm. \nThey look at each other. Jill leans forward and kisses him. She puts the tray of vegetables on the counter. They continue to kiss. \n155   INT. BEDROOM The high school boys are CHANTING. \n156   INT. DORM ROOM \nBOYS Ed -- Ed -- Ed -- Ed... \nCOLLEGE GIRLS (same ones as before). \nCOLLEGE GIRL #1 Oh, I hope she makes love to him! \nCOLLEGE GIRL #2 I thought you didn't like her. \nCOLLEGE GIRL #1 I don't, but I want him to be happy- \nRAPID SHOTS of other VIEWERS, watching, transfixed -- \n157   INT. JILL'S APARTMENT Ed and Jill are making out. They begin taking each other's clothes off. They're passing the point of no return. It's going to happen right there in the kitchen. \nEd and Jill, in heavy heat, back up to the kitchen table and climb on to it. They continue to pull at their own and each, other's clothing. They're making passionate noises. \n158   INT. SHARI'S APARTMENT Shari is not watching television. She's eating a little meal she's made for herself. She HEARS PEOPLE in her building cheering and whooping. She looks miserable. \n159   INT. CONTROL TRUCK \nDIRECTOR (slightly panicky) Someone say the word, how far can we go here? \n160   INT. REAL TV OFFICE Cynthia and her staff are watching. Cynthia is ON THE PHONE- \nCYNTHIA (into phone) Stay with them ... don't leave yet... not yet ... \nJill is on top of Ed. Carried away with passion, Ed attempts to roll her over and get on top. He does, but rolls too far. He crashes off the table, to the floor, face up. \nED (in pain) Ohhh... \nJILL Ed? \nED Ohh... do you own a cat? \nJILL Yeah. Why? \nHe looks at her apologetically. \nED The whole time? Eighteen years? \nHANK No. Two times. \nED What... \nHANK Check forging. \nED Oh, man! So... \nHANK The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so... \nED So you saw me on TV and you said \"Hey, let me jump on this.\" \nHANK I need help. How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me. \nEd doesn't know what to say. He's bitter towards Hank, but there's also some empathy. \nED (to the camera) All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out. (quickly, to Hank) I gotta go. \nHANK Ed... I'm sorry. \nED (still bitter) Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model. \nHANK What... \nED The pirate ship. \nHank looks blankly at him. \nED (CONT'D) -- That we were doing \"together.\" I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - \"That's too much glue. You're using too much glue.\" \nHANK Do you still have it? \nED No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you. \nHe exits. Out in the hallway, he leans back against the door, drained. The camera is right on him, soaking it up. \n167   INT. TV STUDIO The same PBS-type panel of smart-looking people we met earlier. WE OPEN ON about half the panel. \nMODERATOR Let's hear from our guest panelist. You've expressed some interesting thoughts on this, subject. What do you see as the meaning, if there is any, of Ed TV, John. \nREVEAL JOHN, sitting comfortably on the panel, looking very wise. \nJOHN I feel that Ed is the apotheosis of a prevailing American syndrome. It used to be that someone became famous because they were special. Now people are considered special just for being famous. Fame, itself, is now a moral good in this country. It's its own virtue. \nThe others NOD appreciatively as John puts a PIPE in his mouth. \nTV INTERVIEWS \nOLD GUY I was Ed's Little League coach. He had no coordination. The big game, he struck cut with the bases loaded. Then he cried like a woman. It was sickening. \nCUT TO: \nOLD WOMAN I was his third grade teacher. I said \"Take him for tests. There's something wrong with him.\" They didn't listen. \nCUT TO: \nANOTHER GUY He used to steal things from my store. At least I think it was him. Yeah, it was probably him. \n168   EXT. ED'S APARTMENT - DAY A MAN, on the sidewalk, has a STUFFED CAT stuck to his back to tease Ed. \nCAT MAN Hey, look, I just fell off a table! \nSuddenly, a TUBFUL OF WATER crashes down on him. \n169   INT. ED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS Ed at the window, with a now empty plastic tub. \nED (yelling down) Okay, is that funny? \nThen he throws the tub out the window. \nED (CONT'D) (to the camera) How was that? Was that funny?! \n170   INT. NETWORK OFFICE \"DAY 78\" \nAgain, everyone there, including Cynthia. A Honcho is reading a report. \nHONCHO #1 Of more concern than the sag in Ed's ratings is what viewers are feeling about him now. The positives are down and the negatives are up. There's a feeling that Ed isn't cool anymore. We're starting to see a big L.F. \nGREG Hm? \nHONCHO #1 L.F.  Loser Factor. \nHONCHO #2 That's deadly. \nMcILVAINE Not necessarily. I mean instead of running from the L.F., run with it. Create more moments like the table thing. We can package a video \"Ed's Goofiest Moments.\" Let him be America's Goofball. \nCYNTHIA Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go! \nSCHARLACH Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby. \n171   INT. BAR - NIGHT \"DAY 94\" Tad and Barry -- as we met them, originally -- are watching TV. They're really enjoying it -- laughing, pounding the table. \nJEANETTE I'm at the hospital. \nED What's the matter?! \nJEANETTE He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart. \nED Oh God. What hospital? \nJEANETTE St. Joseph's. \nED I'm coming right over. I'll be right there. \nHe hangs up. \n174   INT. TAD'S HOUSE Tad is watching TV and talking an the phone. \nTAD I told you! I told you he was gonna die! \n175   INT. HOSPITAL - AN HOUR LATER Ed rushes in. He goes up to the desk. Carlos is with him. \nED Hi. I'm looking for my mother. Her name is -- \nA DOCTOR spots him. \nDR. GELLER Mr. Pekurny. \nED Yes? \nDR. GELLER I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down. \nED Thank you. Can I see her? \nDR. GELLER Just wait here. She's coming right back out. \nED Mm... (wearily) Oh, man... \nDR. GELLER (sympathetically) \nED What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he... \nDR. GELLER Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet. \nED Really? They were.. \nDR. GELLER (nods) According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that -- \nED Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel? \nDR. GELLER I ... don't know. I ... \nVOICE (O.C.) Eddie. Thank God you're here. \nEddie looks across the room and sees Al in his wheelchair, just entering from outside. He wheels towards Ed. \nAL How's your mother? \nED (shocked) Al! \nAL Our neighbors gave me a ride. \nED Al!! \nAL Where is she? Is she all right? \nEd turns to the doctor. \nED I thought -- I thought he was dead. \nDR. GELLER Who? \nED Al! \nDR. GELLER No. (reads his chart) The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny. \n176   INT. TAD'S HOUSE \nTAD (stunned) Good twist! \n177   INT. HOSPITAL \nAL You thought it was me? \nED Yes! \nAL It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack. \nED Went -- \nAgain, Ed turns to the doctor. \nNURSE Dr. Geller, Dr. Stack wants to see you. \nDR. GELLER (to Ed) Excuse me. \nRAY That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left. \nED I put his -- who -- (to Marcia) Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back. \nMARCIA (too loudly) That's not funny!! \nEd CRINGES. \n183   EXT. GRAVESITE - A LITTLE LATER The service ends. The small group begins to walk away. Ray and Marcia go off together, ignoring Ed. Jeanette is attempting to wheel Al away from the grave, but she's hitting ruts. Ed approaches. \nED I'11 take it. \nJEANTTE (to Al, uncomfortably) Sweetheart, I'm gonna go ahead and sign all the papers. \nAL Right. \nShe touches him but he pulls away. Ed wheels Al. \nED Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can -- \nAL I'm moving out. \nED What?! \nAL I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights. \nED (really upset) Oh, Al ... This is just... \nAL Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me. \nHe stops wheeling and crouches down next to Al. \nED I want to tell you something... I love you. You're my father. \nPause. \nAL I love you, too. \nAl KISSES him. \nAL (CONT'D) I'11 build a pirate ship with you. \nEd wheels him away. \n184   INT. CYNTHIA'S OFFICE She's watching. She's genuinely moved. She wipes her eyes. \n185   INT. BAR - NIGHT This place is sleazy. Ed enters, worn out. He crosses to the bar where we find, Jeanette nursing a drink. She's not drunk, but she is wallowing. \nED Hi, Ma. \nJEANETTE (startled) Ed! How did you know I was here? \nED You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this? \nJEANETTE Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore! \nED (cringes) Ma... \nJEANETTE I'm a tramp (pulls on the sleeve of the man next to her) Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us! \nED And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home. \nJEANETTE (exiting) I'm a whore! (yells at an employee) Your bathrooms are filthy! \nThey're out. \n186   EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS Ed is helping Jeanette. Ray arrives. He's ANGRY. \nRAY I'11 take her. You humiliated our mother on national television. You've single- handedly destroyed this family. \nED I -- Oh, but that book you wrote was a real love-letter. That... toilet paper with covers. \nBYSTANDER #1 That book sucked. I want my money back. \nED Oh great. Where's Moe? \nHe looks around. Moe is gone. \nRAY Come on, Ma. \nED (to Ray) Let's remember how I got into this. \"Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break.\" (pretends to cry) \nRAY You know what your problem is? \nED Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like \"We grew up in a small, little bedroom.\" As opposed to a big, little bedroom? \nRAY I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault. \nED Me?! That's you! \nRAY I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault. \nBYSTANDER #2 Right. Like you say you love Shari, but, you wouldn't mind noodling that model. \nCynthia stares, amazed. \n191   EXT. STREET Ed WALKING ZOMBIE-LIKE- CROWDS SWARM. \n192   INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY Ed is with STEVE, a lawyer. Steve has a huge contract on his desk. \nSTEVE This contract you signed? ... It's a masterpiece. Don't go to war with these guys. You fart in the wrong direction they can take everything you own and leave you naked by the side of the road. You ever going to get back with that Jill? Ooh -- she was nice. Shari, I didn't like that much (\"imitates\" a gabby girl) \"yet-tet-tet-tet-tet-tet-tet.\" \nED Shut up. \n193   INT. DINER - NIGHT Ed is sitting alone, eating lunch. He's surrounded by cameras and shielded by BODYGUARDS. \nOUTSIDE the diner a CROWD of rubberneckers is out on the sidewalk, looking in at him, some of them acting up, some just staring in. Ed is tired. He glances out the window and makes a MONKEY FACE. Suddenly, he FREEZES. \nHe sees Shari's face in the crowd. She puts her fist in her mouth. \n194   EXT. STREET - NIGHT Ed and Shari are walking -- on camera. \nSHARI 1 bailed. I bailed on you. \nED Kinda'. \nSHARI It's what I do. I yell \"Geronimo\" and jump out of a relationship. \nHe laughs. \nPause. \nSHARI (CONT'D) You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner. \nED What did you do to your hair? \nSHARI My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut. \nED It's nice. \nHe touches her hair. They leap on each other. They're KISSING. \n195   INT. NETWORK CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY Big meeting. Many Honchos, including Scharlach and Cynthia. All but Cynthia are focused. Cynthia looks bored. \nHONCHO #l I think this could be great. What if Ed and Shari decide to get married? A wedding? The cute, little half-Asian nephew in a tuxedo, carrying the ring on one of those big fluffy pillows - we'11 kill. A sixty share. \nA secretary (MILDRED) enters. She's a little flustered. \nMILDRED Um... Mr. Scharlach, um -- you're not watching TV? \nSCHARLACH No, Mildred, we're working. \nMILDRED Um... Ed -- and Shari are -- \nSEAVER Engaged? \nMILDRED No. Here. They're in the building. They're on their way up. \nScharlach indicates that he wants someone to turn on the TV. Someone does and they see Ed and Shari coming down the hall. They enter the conference room. The cameras, of course, are with them. Ed is carrying a CARTON. \nED Hi, kids. Busy? \nMUCH CONFUSION \nED (CONT'D) I just came up to pass out these Ed TV hats. \nHe takes a lot of HATS out of the carton and begins placing on the heads of the Honchos. \nED (CONT'D) A guy made these up for me. He spelled Ed with two D's. Okay, listen. The real reason I came up here -- and then I'11 get out of your way -- is I've been thinking about what you said. About let's start having more fun with this show, you know? Let's give it a big kick in the ass. \nHONCHO #1 Well, we were thinking -- \nED (cheerfully) Shut up. \nHe takes back that Honcho's hat. \nED (CONT'D) Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in. \nSHARI (rehearsed) What do we have to do? \nED My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm glad you asked. The contest is who can dig up -- legally, of course -- I'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV. \nThe Honchos staring blankly. \nED (CONT'D) But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV. (to the Honchos, excitedly) Hah? \nSHARI So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number. \nShe holds up a CARD. \n196   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM It's packed with LAWYERS and EXECS. Everyone is agitated, except Cynthia, who seems relaxed-Ed and Shari are gone. \nSCHARLACH Legal?! How can this be legal? It's defamation! It's slander! It's... \nLAWYER Not, technically. He is not showing a reckless disregard for the truth. \nSCHARLACH You're fired! \n", "test1_input": "Ed LAUGHS. Ray gives her a KISS. \nShari's roommate RITA sits down. \nRITA Hi. \nSHARI You guys know my roommate, Rita. \nThey do, vaguely. \nED What's going on over there? \nRITA Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing. \nJOHN Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this? \nED (not sure) Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something? \nRAY You know, that would be like a great thing. \nED What? \nRAY That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch. \nED What are you drunk? \nRAY Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business. \nED What is?! \nRAY Show business. \nED You're in show business? \nRAY Yeah. I service video equipment. \nED That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA. \nRAY (insulted) I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter! \nED Thumbsucker! \nRAY I'm making a tape. \nED We're excited. \n7\tINT. BAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER Ed and Shari, waiting for drink orders. \nED So Ray met the family. \nSHARI Yeah... \nED I hear the dog really liked him. \nSHARI Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me. \nED Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you. \nShe takes Ed's beer. \nSHARI You shouldn't drink. \nThey LAUGH. \n8\tINT. TABLE - A LITTLE LATER Ed and Shari ARM-WRESTLING. After a struggle, Ed wins. Ed is impressed. \nED Jesus! \nShari wrings out her arm and picks up her beer. \nSHARI (continuing a previous conversation) And, you know, every guy I ever broke up with, the minute it was over, I could tell you what went wrong, how it went wrong, why it had to go wrong... but when I'm in it... lost. I'm like a love coroner. Bring me the corpse, I'11 tell you what killed it. But how to prevent it? Lost. \nEd LAUGHS. \nED Ray's on. \nThey walk over. \nANGLE ON RAY \nRAY (to camera) Hi. I'm Ray Pekurney. I'm from Paramus, New Jersey... \n9\tINT. CYNTHIA'S OFFICE - DAY She's watching Ray's tape. Ray thinks he's funnier and cuter than he is. \nRAY (ON TAPE) All my friends tell me \"Ray, you've got too much personality for one guy.\" It's like at a party -- I'm at the center of the attention. Everybody loves me. \nHe gets hit in the face by a hors d'oeuvre. \nRAY (CONT'D) Ha, ha, ha. I'll kick your ass. No really, let me show you my girlfriend. She's really cute. \nHe reaches out and grabs Shari's wrist. Shari is struggling to stay out of frame. We just see her arm and Ray pulling on it. Ray lets go. \nRAY (CONT'D) She's strong, 'cause she's a Fedex girl. She lifts those packages. But she's not dikey at all, she's really pretty. \n", "test1_true": "WE SEE the camera shooting an empty space. \nThen Ed's head appears sideways right in front of the CAMERA. \nED Hello I'm Ed. \nHe starts to sniff. \nED (CONT'D) What smells? \nHe steps back from the camera and straightens his head as he SNIFFS. He's more relaxed than Ray. \nED (CONT'D) What is that smell? Oop, I think it's this idea. One person on TV all day long? (screams) Are you nuts? \nWE HEAR LAUGHS \nThe Real TV Staff are enjoying Ed's tape while they eat lunch out of styrofoam containers. \nED (CONT'D) Seriously, get your resumes in order. When my brother Ray - whose personality you were just dazzled by -- told me he was going to try out for this -- I said, \"why in the world would anyone want to be on TV all day long, no privacy, everybody knowing your business, exposing every single detail of your life I mean... why would anyone want to do that? But then I thought of a reason... (loudly) Why the hell not? \nHe KISSES the LENS, smudging it. \nCynthia, watching, cracks up. The others seem to like him to. \n10    INT. VIDEO STORE - DAY This is a video store in Paramus, New Jersey. It's busy. PEOPLE are in line to check out tapes. \nWE OPEN ON a WOMAN -- a mother -- who is rummaging through her purse for her Blockbuster card. She looks up and sees that her TWO CHILDREN have opened several boxes of candy from the candy display and are eating from the boxes. \nMOTHER Oh for -- Put those -- Oh God... \nShe grabs the boxes from them. The boxes are ripped more than she thought and candy goes flying all over. She bends to pick it up. \nEd appears. He works here. \nED (to the Mom) We'11 take care of it. \nSomeone arrives with a broom. \nED (CONT'D) (to the broom guy) Here. This time throw it out, don't eat it. \nLOU, the Manager passes. \nED Lou, can I talk to you a second? \nLou seems like he'd prefer to avoid this. \nLOU Um, yeah, I was gonna ... \nED What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision - \nLOU Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry. \nED Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me? \nLOU I batted! \nED You batted or you bunted? \nLOU Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday. \nED Well, then I'm quitting. \nLOU Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called \"Get your shit together before it's too late.\" \nED (wise-ass) Who's in it? \nCLERK Ed, telephone. \nEd goes to the phone. \nED (into the phone) Yeah... Are you serious? ... Come on, no kidding, who is this? ... Holy shit! \n11    INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - ANOTHER DAY Ed is being interviewed by the \"Real TV\" staff whom we met earlier. He's slightly less comfortable than on his tape, but he's good. \nED I had one year of college. And then one year of junior college. \nCYNTHIA (O.C.) What did you study? \nED Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then? \nThey LAUGH. \nCUT TO: \n11A   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER \nED Well, there's Ray, my brother. He's... ambitious. Like a few years ago, he started this mobile dog-grooming business. But, like, out of his Camry. He had this bathtub in his trunk - (Ed starts cracking up) he's throwing the dogs in there, they're fighting and splashing, then he'd slam the trunk down, let 'em run around inside screaming getting all wet... then he'd use the car exhaust to dry'em. (wiping his eyes) Ah, Ray... he just can't get a break. \nCUT TO: \n11B   INT.

SHARI'S APARTMENT Ed realizes that Ray's been called a \"bad lay\" on television. \nED Oh my God. \nSHARI (directly into the camera) I mean bad. \nED Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him. \nShe starts to cry. \nED (CONT'D) Look... whether you get back together or not, you're too terrific a person to... lower yourself like this. \n74    INT.

{"test1_input": "ED My sister -- Marcia, I mean she can't get a break. About seven years ago she falls in love with this Vietnamese guy who wants to marry her so he can stay in the country. So they get married, they have a kid, he gets his citizenship, immediately divorces my sister and marries this Vietnamese woman who, he was probably already married to all along. She can pick 'em. (pause) She's got a nice little boy, though. My nephew, Andy. \nCUT TO: \n11C   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER \nED My Mom's okay. Kinda. I knew a guy who hated his mother - Stuey Shwam. He hated his mother so much, he had his belly button removed. \nCUT TO: \n11D   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER \nED No, I've never been married. \nThe interviewer seems to be waiting for him to elaborate. He doesn't. He shrugs -- that's it. \nCUT TO: \n11E   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER \nED Oh, my father -what an asshole. When I was twelve, my mother needed a hysterectomy -- my father ran off with her nurse! And that's the last I heard of him. \nCUT TO: \n11F   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER \nED Al, my stepfather he's opinionated. And you have to listen because he's like in a wheelchair. \nCUT TO: \n11G   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER \nED I like my job -- I mean I'm doing all right. I'm not sure how long I want to stay there, you know... I mean, I'm thirty-one... I'm not sure I want to be a video store clerk when I'm forty... Of course, I didn't expect to be doing it 'til I was thirty-one, either. But... you know I'm... keeping my options open. Anything comes along, I'm ready to pounce. (growls like a cougar) \nCUT TO: \n11H   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER \nED A dream? Of course I have a dream I just don't know what the hell it is. (shrugs and smiles) \nEd's image freezes, while he has a funny-cute expression on his face. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL a TV in a conference room with Ed's frozen image on it. Cynthia is there with her bosses, the people who run the network that owns Real TV. The top man is MR. SCHARLACH. His deputies are MS. SEAVER and MR. McILVAINE. This is not the same place where we met Cynthia and her staff. This is richer, more corporate and formal. \nCYNTHIA He's who we want to go with. \nSCHARLACH (doubtfully) This guy. \nCYNTHIA I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable. \nSCHARLACH I'm not sure about the entire concept. \nCynthia is frustrated. \nCYNTHIA Look it's not like we're burning up the airwaves now. We're running neck-and-neck with The Gardening Channel. If people just tune in to this twice a day for five minutes, we're a hit. Plus we can sell advertising every second, running at the bottom of the screen... and the beauty is this guy doesn't even have to be good. I mean if he's good, great. But if he winds up making an ass of himself, better. \nMcILVAINE How is that better? \nCYNTHIA Come on. People cannot turn away from an accident. You drive by, you say \"Ooh, I hope there's not a head lying in the road\" but you look ! See, nobody in America wants to be nobody. This guy wants to be famous. So, basically, the deal is he agrees to drive down the highway a hundred miles an hour blindfolded and we get to see if his head winds up rolling down the highway. Fun for the whole family. So let's do it. \nShe stops, waiting for approval. \n12    INT. VIDEO STORE \nSCHARLACH (coldly) Good luck. \nEd's RE-STOCKING the SHELVES \nHe gets goosed from behind \nRAY (O.C.) (very loud and happy) Hey... \nED (goosed) Oh! \nEd DROPS the BOXES. Ray is there with Shari. \nRAY I got your message. Way to go! \nED Hi, Shari. (to Ray) Let's go in the stockroom. \n13    INT. STOCKROOM Ed and Ray enter. \nRAY So when do you start? \nED I ... I'm not gonna do it. \nRAY What? \nED Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just... \nRAY (disgusted) Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you! \nHe slaps a tape off a shelf. \n", "test1_true": "RAY In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something -- \nED Why do you do that? \nRAY What? \nED Whenever you ask me something why do you always say \"Let me ask you something?\" Why don't you just ask me? \nRAY (impatiently) All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this? \nED I'm doing all right. \nRAY Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here? \nShari enters, curious about the yelling. She stands there quietly, unnoticed by the guys. \nRAY (CONT'D) You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the \"Ernest\" movies? \nED Screw off. \nRAY How many opportunities are you going to get in your life? \nED I don't know. \nRAY That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us. \nED Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please -- \nRAY Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot. (sees Shari) Hi. \nEd turns and sees Shari. She's self-conscious. She feels like she's been caught eavesdropping. \nSHARI Oh. I -- I heard Ray yelling. 1 didn't mean to -- \nRAY (to Ed) Give me a chance. I'm begging you. I need a break. Look, I'11 cover your ass. I'11 ride shotgun. Just bring those cameras over to me and I'11 make something happen for both of us. I swear. Come on, Eddie \nPause. \nED All right. \nRAY Yeah?! \nED Yeah. \nRay lifts Ed up. \nRay kisses Ed. \nRAY (to Shari) Is this guy a brother?! \n14    INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT Moderate-priced, restaurant. \nWE OPEN ON a CLOSE-UP of AL. He's about seventy. \nREVEAL THE FAMILY \nAL What happens when you go to the bathroom? Do they go in with you? \nEd, Ray, Al, JEANETTE and MARCIA. Al is in a WHEELCHAIR and has an oxygen mask connected to a tank. He periodically takes a hit of oxygen. He's a little short of breath, but loves to talk. Jeanette is Ed's mother -- about sixty. Marcia is a little older than Ed. \nED No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then - \nAL What if--you're vomiting? \nED (amazed by the question) What if I'm vomiting? \nAL Do they show it? \nED I guess -- I don't -- it's all in the contract. There's this million-page contract -- \nRAY Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this? \nMARCIA (accusing, to Ed) What happened? You described this \"crazy-kooky\" family who'd be a million laughs on TV? \nED No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from. \nMARCIA (angrily) They're gonna mock our foibles. \nED Our what? \nMARCIA Our foibles, our foibles! \nRAY We don't have foibles. \nMARCIA Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles. \nJEANTTE Eddie, please don't let them mock our foibles. \nED (losing it) Stop saying foibles! \nMARCIA Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours. \n", "test1_id": 39, "test2_input": "JEANETTE (O.C.) No. It's a mess. \nED Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you. \nAfter a pause, Jeanette enters, very camera-conscious. \nED (CONT'D) (to the camera) This is my mother. \nSTIFFLY, he gives her a kiss. \nED (CONT'D) Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and -- \nJEANETTE Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend. \nED Hey, he cheated on her. \nJEANETTE He made a mistake. \nED I don't want to -- do you know where he is? \nJEANETTE No. Maybe he's watching. (indicates the camera) Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl. \nED No! And that girl has a name. \nAL What do you love her or something? \nED (embarrassed) Come on... \nAL (teasing) Look at your face. I had a car that color. \nVARIOUS REACTIONS OF VIEWERS really liking this. \nBACK TO SCENE \nJEANETTE I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy. \nED No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay? \nHe KISSES her again. \nED (CONT'D) How's Marcia? She all right? \nJEANETTE I don't know. She's living with that \"entertainer\"... \nED (trying to make his mother feel better) Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time. \nJEANETTE (unconvinced) Mm. \nED You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left. \nJEANETTE (looks at the TV) Oh my God! \nED I mean, that worked out. \nJEANETTE Oh my God!! \nShe gets in the closet and closes the door. \n92    INT. OFFICE \nED (to the camera) I think we're through here. \nThe Real TV group is there. They're smiling. Cynthia is ON the PHONE \nCYNTHIA (into phone) I will. I'11 tell them. (hangs up) That was Scharlach. All of you, scrub your asses. He's coming over to kiss them. \nThey all WHOOP and LAUGH. \n93    INT. SHARI'S APARTMENT - DAY Shari and Rita are watching Ed leave his parents house on TV. Rita is very excited. Shari is ON the PHONE. \nSHARI (into phone) Um, I'd like to get a new phone number, please... Because I'm getting calls from every nut case in America... Right, unlisted... Sure. (she holds) \nRITA Aren't you excited? He said he loved you on television! \nSHARI He didn't say it. His stepfather said it. \nRITA (joking) Well, the stepfather's cute... Seriously, how do you feel about Ed? \nPause. \nSHARI I think he's great. He just makes me feel... oh, I'm really gonna get hurt, this time - Hello ... \nCUTS OF VARIOUS VIEWERS WATCHING REAL TV \nEnd on TAD and BARRY in a health club. This is the refreshment area. They've played racquetball and they're sweaty. They're watching Real TV. \nTAD I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die. \nBARRY What do you mean \"they're gonna have him die?\" \nTAD You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ...

VIDEO STORE - DAY Ed arrives for work. \nPeople CALL OUT to him-- PEDESTRIANS, PEOPLE FROM CARS, TRUCK DRIVERS. \"Hey Ed, my man.\" Ed waves. People shake his hand. A teenage boy looks into the camera, making a funny face. Someone else looks into the camera and says, \"Hi, Ma.\" \nSuddenly, Ray is there with a WOMAN. Ray is not happy. He's wearing DARK GLASSES and a HAT. \nRAY Hi. \nEd stops. \nED ... Ray? \nRAY Yeah. \nED Oh, man, I've been trying to call you. \nRAY I know. \nED Look, we gotta talk. \nRAY Save it. \nA GUY in a car appears and points at Ray. \nGUY Hey, you're that French guy on TV. \nRAY French guy? \nGUY Monsieur Bad-a-lay. \nThe guy drives away. Ray is steaming. \nRAY Let me just do what I came here to do. \nEd thinks he means to fight. Ed tries to calm him. \nED What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me -- \nRAY (beckoning) Cassie... \nCASSIE, a woman about Ray's age, steps forward. She's slightly self-conscious. \nRAY (CONT'D) Go ahead. \nRay points Cassie to the camera. \nCASSIE This is really hard. \nRAY You promised me. \nCASSIE (to the camera) I went out with Ray a few years ago for... a couple of months. And we... were intimate. And. he's really not as bad as that girl said he was. \nRay nods. \nCASSIE (CONT'D) I mean, I've definitely had worse. \nRAY That's enough. \nEd is amazed that Ray would do this. \nRAY (CONT'D) (to Ed) Good-bye, brother! \nED Ray, come an-- \nRay leaves, still angry. \nCassie lingers. \nCASSIE (flirting slightly) So you're Ed. \nRay returns and yanks Cassie away with him. Ed still hasn't recovered from the bizarreness he just witnessed. Two girls YELL in unison from across the street. \nGIRLS Ed... we love you! \n95    INT. REAL TV OFFICE - NIGHT Cynthia and her staff, around a conference call box. \nCYNTHIA We're not going to be able to come over there for anymore midnight meetings. People are starting to watch your building. The interest level in you is soaring. \nINTERCUT WITH: \n95A   INT. ED'S BEDROOM. Ed's OFF-CAMERA \nED Soaring is good, right? I mean, that means you're not gonna cancel me, right? \nKEITH (sotto) Man, he wants that balloon payment. \nED (V.O.) Huh? \nTERRY Ed, why didn't you go over to see Shari today?

Shari, I didn't like that much (\"imitates\" a gabby girl) \"yet-tet-tet-tet-tet-tet-tet.\" \nED Shut up. \n193   INT. DINER - NIGHT Ed is sitting alone, eating lunch. He's surrounded by cameras and shielded by BODYGUARDS. \nOUTSIDE the diner a CROWD of rubberneckers is out on the sidewalk, looking in at him, some of them acting up, some just staring in. Ed is tired. He glances out the window and makes a MONKEY FACE. Suddenly, he FREEZES. \nHe sees Shari's face in the crowd. She puts her fist in her mouth. \n194   EXT. STREET - NIGHT Ed and Shari are walking -- on camera. \nSHARI 1 bailed. I bailed on you. \nED Kinda'. \nSHARI It's what I do. I yell \"Geronimo\" and jump out of a relationship. \nHe laughs. \nPause. \nSHARI (CONT'D) You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner. \nED What did you do to your hair? \nSHARI My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut. \nED It's nice. \nHe touches her hair. They leap on each other. They're KISSING. \n195   INT. NETWORK CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY Big meeting. Many Honchos, including Scharlach and Cynthia. All but Cynthia are focused. Cynthia looks bored. \nHONCHO #l I think this could be great. What if Ed and Shari decide to get married? A wedding? The cute, little half-Asian nephew in a tuxedo, carrying the ring on one of those big fluffy pillows - we'11 kill. A sixty share. \nA secretary (MILDRED) enters. She's a little flustered. \nMILDRED Um... Mr. Scharlach, um -- you're not watching TV? \nSCHARLACH No, Mildred, we're working. \nMILDRED Um... Ed -- and Shari are -- \nSEAVER Engaged? \nMILDRED No. Here. They're in the building. They're on their way up. \nScharlach indicates that he wants someone to turn on the TV. Someone does and they see Ed and Shari coming down the hall. They enter the conference room. The cameras, of course, are with them. Ed is carrying a CARTON. \nED Hi, kids. Busy? \nMUCH CONFUSION \nED (CONT'D) I just came up to pass out these Ed TV hats. \nHe takes a lot of HATS out of the carton and begins placing on the heads of the Honchos. \nED (CONT'D) A guy made these up for me. He spelled Ed with two D's. Okay, listen. The real reason I came up here -- and then I'11 get out of your way -- is I've been thinking about what you said. About let's start having more fun with this show, you know? Let's give it a big kick in the ass. \nHONCHO #1 Well, we were thinking -- \nED (cheerfully) Shut up. \nHe takes back that Honcho's hat. \nED (CONT'D) Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in. \nSHARI (rehearsed) What do we have to do? \nED My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm glad you asked. The contest is who can dig up -- legally, of course -- I'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV. \nThe Honchos staring blankly. \nED (CONT'D) But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV. (to the Honchos, excitedly) Hah? \nSHARI So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number. \nShe holds up a CARD. \n196   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM It's packed with LAWYERS and EXECS. Everyone is agitated, except Cynthia, who seems relaxed-Ed and Shari are gone. \nSCHARLACH Legal?! How can this be legal? It's defamation! It's slander! It's... \nLAWYER Not, technically.

We put together a video. \"The Network Executives Goofiest Moments.\" And listen, i've really loved working here. \nOn the word \"loved\" she shot Scharlach THE FINGER.

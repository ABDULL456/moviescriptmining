ED Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good. 
BIRDY Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane. 
ED Hello, Tony. 
TONY Hello, sir. 
Silence. The teens wait for the adult to direct the conversation; Ed has nothing to say. At length, he clears his throat. 
ED ...Well, congratulations. I guess I'll be getting home. 
TONY Nice to meet you, sir. 
TURANDOT SUITE 
It is morning. We are tracking past an unmade bed toward the bathroom, where we hear water running. 
ED (V.O.) ...Anyway, that's what I was thinking about in the days leading up to the trial. It seemed like once that was over, I'd be ready for a new start. Freddy Riedenschneider was very optimistic. He was busy preparing... 
We have rounded the open bathroom door to find Riedenschneider hunched over the sink, toothbrush in hand, spitting out water. He rises, looks at himself in the mirror, sprinkles some tonic in his hair. 
ED (V.O.) ...And finally it came... the first day of the trial... 
Riedenschneider runs his fingers through his hair. 
ED (V.O.) ...What Riedenschneider called the Big Show. 
He straightens his tie, gives his neck a twist. 
COURTROOM 
We are close on the back of Riedenschneider's gleaming hair. He is sitting at the defense table. 
There is a murmur of a crowd that has yet to be called to order. 
FRANK Where's the judge? How come there's no judge? 
Ed and Frank sit next to each other in the first gallery row directly behind Riedenschneider. 
FRANK ...Where's the judge, Ed? 
Ed shrugs. Frank looks at Riedenschneider's back. 
FRANK ...How come the judge doesn't come out? 
RIEDENSCHNEIDER The judge comes in last. He'll come in when Doris gets here. 
FRANK So where's Doris? I thought we started at ten. Hey, Riedenschneider, where's Doris? 
Riedenschneider is curt: 
RIEDENSCHNEIDER She's late. 
FRANK Late? How can she be late? 
Riedenschneider doesn't answer; Frank turns to Ed. 
FRANK ...She's in prison, Ed. None of *us* are in prison, and yet we're not late. We're on time, Ed. How can Doris be late? What, they don't have wake-up calls? 
The murmur of the crowd subsides as a door behind the judge's bench opens and the judge hurriedly enters. 
The gallery rises but the judge quickly waves them back down and, rather than seating himself, leans forward over his desk to give a peremptory beckoning wave to Riedenschneider and the prosecutor. 
JUDGE Counselors. 
Riedenschneider, puzzled, approaches the bench, as does his counterpart from the other table. The judge, still leaning forward, speaks to them in a low voice that is not audible from the gallery. 
The crowd has started murmuring again, also in hushed tones. Frank leans in toward Ed. 
FRANK What's going on, Ed? I thought there would be arguments. The bailiff, and so forth...

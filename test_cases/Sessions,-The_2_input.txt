CHERYL Hi, I'm Cheryl. I'm sorry I'm late. 
VERA No, that's fine. Come in. I'm Vera, I'm one of Mark's helpers. 
Cheryl sees Mark. There is no noticeable reaction in her face, just a smile. 
CHERYL Hi, Mark O'Brien. 
Mark clears his throat with a little difficulty. 
MARK Hi, Cheryl Cohen Greene. 
Vera is already at the front door. 
VERA I'll be back, say, in two hours? 
CHERYL Yes, two hours, that would be perfect. 
She closes the door behind her. Mark feels totally abandoned. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) So... 
Mark blurts out. 
MARK Your money's on the dresser. 
Cheryl walks over to the dresser. When her back is turned, Mark screws up his face in self-disgust. She finds an envelope. 
CHERYL Thank you. 
She puts it in her bag. Mark eyes her carefully. 
MARK That was the wrong way to start off. 
CHERYL Yes, it was. Shall we start again? 
MARK Please, you start. 
She sits down on the bed and looks at him. It is a very frank stare. She is trying to take a lot in. 
CHERYL Although the aim is for us to have sex, I'm not a prostitute and you don't need to pay me up front. I've nothing against prostitutes, but there's a difference. We can talk about that later. 
MARK I'm sorry. 
CHERYL The other thing is, there is a limit to the number of sessions we can have together. Did Laura mention that when you saw her? 
MARK I'm sorry, I don't remember. 
CHERYL The limit is six. But that gives us plenty of opportunity to explore. Now, I understand you are able to have an erection. 
MARK Yes, but not out of choice. 
CHERYL Do you know how many men there are on this planet who would give anything for a natural erection? 
She looks around the room. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) Is this your place? 
MARK No, it's a friend's. The only bedroom furniture I have at my place is an iron lung. I've sometimes thought about buying a futon, in case the need arose.

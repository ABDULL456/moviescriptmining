Ramsey is utterly lost and just sort of nods, but Novak is fascinated.  Catherine presses the bump on her hand.  A RED INDICATOR LIGHT flashes on. 
HENRY There's a touch-sensitive microchip implanted in her hand.  If she becomes frightened, disoriented, or simply wants to end the session, she signals us to abort. 
Catherine presses again and the red light shuts off. 
MIRIAM Although none of what she experiences is real, she can be tricked into thinking it is.  The mind is awfully gullible, so she needs to monitor herself. 
Catherine and Stargher are suspended from the ceiling.  Henry types and the lights dim to a more somber, tranquil level. Various screens flicker to life, displaying the vital signs of both "feed" and receive."  Miriam initiates the injection program. 
MIRIAM (CONT'D) Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or... 
CATHERINE No.  No. 
IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, we see chemicals mix with her blood, then feed the IV.  AT THE CONSOLE, as Henry types furiously at the computer keyboard, Novak asks Miriam: 
NOVAK You said she has a "gift." 
Overhearing, Henry interrupts, pointing at a section of Catherine's "mind map." 
HENRY Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke. 
MIRIAM Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy. (clarifies) When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared. 
A hopeful, solemn Novak gazes through the window, watching Catherine's body as it becomes parallel to Stargher's... 
IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Catherine takes a deep breath and as the drugs take effect, feels herself losing consciousness. She glances at Stargher, a man who tortures and kills women, then looks up as the CLOTH MASK descends from the ceiling. 
MIRIAM (O.S.) (CONT'D) Intravenous administration complete. 
HENRY (O.S.) Initiating connection. 
We follow fibrous wires running from Catherine's mask to Stargher's.  Their blood mixing with chemicals in the IV-like containers.  The computer system humming. 
HENRY (O.S.) (CONT'D) Transfer begins 1100 hours, 34 minutes, 12 seconds. 
Catherine's eye focuses on the mask.  As it comes closer, we see the lining is laced with thread-like wires and microchips forming hyper-miniature circuit boards.  Catherine's eye blinks.  The mask covers her face.  Catherine's eye shuts. 
Vision fades.  Darkness.  A faint light.  Microscopic veins in the eyelid become wires connected to chips.  And we're MOVING, into the circuitry. 
ENTRANCE ONE 
INT. STARGHER'S WORLD 
The pattern of the electronics grows into something more organic, textured, concrete.  Evolving into a world.  Black and shadow-filled, it resembles a labyrinthine complex of vertical walls with cubicle like rooms carved deep into its core. 
Our journey into this bleak, grim place continues and we occasionally glimpse brief images of a boy's baptism. 
INTERCUT with this journey are sections of cloudy blackness and fragmented visions of CATHERINE connected to the apparatus, face masked, DESCENDING into this world. 
There is an abrupt SHIFT from still images to regular motion and we find ourselves gliding over a tidepool filled with tiny fish and tadpoles.  At water's edge, lying on rough, pebble-strewn ground, is a HAND. 
Catherine's hand.  We sense MOVEMENT, but she remains still. From the darkness comes a DOG.  Black in color and featureless, it sniffs Catherine, dismisses her, and meanders into a cubicle opposite her, disappearing from view.  After a moment of odd quiet, a DROP OF BLOOD hits the mask and we follow Catherine's hand as it moves to the cloth and removes it from her own face. 
IN MACROSCOPIC SUPER SLOW-MOTIONS, another BLOOD DROPLET sails 64 into the air and comes crashing down, hitting a RED ANT, catapulting it onto what looks like a tree, but is just a TWIG.  As the insect scurries away, MORE DROPS pound the earth, splatter against "twig trees," and explode into pools of stagnant water... 
As we begin to realize that this miniature landscape is the world into which Catherine descended. 
She sits up, shivering, and breathes deeply, acclimating to her surroundings.  The "floor" is covered with filth, ash, pebbles, and insects.  Water is present in many forms, puddles, moisture, dripping ceilings. 
Eyes focusing, queasy, not fully "awake," Catherine notices the crimson stain on the cloth mask and the blood droplets showering the air.  She turns and finds the source. 
THE BLACK DOG stands in the opposite room next to a tub full of BLOOD, shaking himself dry after his "bath."  Satisfied, the animal stops and trots away.  Still adjusting to this nightmarish realm, Catherine at first doesn't hear it, but then realizes that somewhere, a child is CRYING.  She looks around, then through a crack in the "floor," briefly catches sight of a BOY beneath her, on a level lower than hers.  As he disappears into corridor ending in "nothing," we PULL BACK to show a MASSIVE LANDSCAPE of blocks, cubicles, crawlspace, walls, stairs, and ladders.  Leading everywhere and nowhere.

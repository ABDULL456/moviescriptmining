BERLIN What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend? 
Lots of headshake. And lots of silences. "I really don't know." 
That's O.K. Can you give me any idea what this fellow was like? (Headshake) Well, d'you know how old he was? (Headshake) Alright, let me put it this way? How old d'you think I am? Twenty- six? Thirty-nine? Or fifty-three? 
HELENA Fifty-three. 
Possibly the only grin ROSS is going to get out of this place. 
BERLIN You must have some idea about him. 
HELENA When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde? 
BERLIN No. 
HELENA Why not? You heard my voice? 
A good point. And a point taken. And BERLIN might even say so. 
We don't have some kind of sixth-sense, you know. Ex- cept in ridiculous novels .. 
Now another silence overtaken by a low whistle in another room. 
He used a breath freshener ... 
A sardonic headshake from ROSS. Well that solves the case then! 
And I think his name was John? 
BERLIN John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John? 
HELENA I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some? 
BERLIN would but ROSS wouldn't. She leaves and whispers begin. 
BERLIN This looks promising .. I think this one could be it? 
ROSS Thank Christ we got a witness. 
BERLIN Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something? 
ROSS What? She's blind, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano? 
He thumbs a cluster of cheap busts of composers on an upright. 
We're better off having another pop at old Abe Lincoln down the- re? Get angry with the prick. Get some of his "useful visions" in? Someone must have seen something? 
Negative from BERLIN. Checked it out. Sunday and no one about. 
This is fucken crazy. Two hours here, two hours back, and the only word I've written is John .. 
A touch later and the sun is setting. ROSS stands at a window to watch it go. Watches one or two cars driving away. Watches a bird sitting outside on the fire-escape. BERLIN's voice can just about be heard off screen "You said he spoke? Can you re- member what he said?" ROSS saunters back into HELENA's answer. 
HELENA Well, he just said, come on, hurry up, will you, because it's starting to snow again. 
Empty teacups and empty notebook. ROSS sits opposite BERLIN. 
And I remember, he was a lit- tle breathless from carrying the cases because the elevat- or had gone out that weekend. 
BERLIN The elevator wasn't working? 
HELENA No, it has a mind of its own. 
A clock strikes four somewhere. And BERLIN knows he's lost it. 
BERLIN Can I see your hands? 
HELENA My hands? 
He takes her hands and HELENA immediately looks uncomfortable. He examines scars and she stares at him with her useless eyes. 
I have a class.  I have to go. 
BERLIN Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small? 
HELENA No. Except he smoked. Like you. 
BERLIN Me? 
HELENA Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's. 
A taut instant between ROSS and BERLIN. BERLIN caught out and he knows it. ROSS roars in silence "YOU LYING PIG" and writes in his notebook. The angle switches to see "BERLIN IS A LIAR." 
I'm late .. I really have to go .. 
Everyone suddenly on their feet and HELENA gets into a jacket. 
BERLIN D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog? 
HELENA No.

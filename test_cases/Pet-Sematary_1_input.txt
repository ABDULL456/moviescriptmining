JUD'S panting and out of breath; LOUIS is, if anything, in worse shape. 
JUD Almost there, Louis. 
LOUIS You keep saying that. 
JUD This time I mean it. 
He tops the last step and stands on a rocky level under the stars, the wind blowing his hair off his deeply lined brow. A few moments later LOUIS joins him and stares with undisguised wonder. 
EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS AND JUD'S POV 
The top of this hill or bluff is rocky and bare, but there are a number of rocky piles. But for every pile of rocks we can see, there are ten littered heaps, as if the neat piles had been burst apart. There's a shape to all of this, and it is the shape of the Pet Sematary: concentric circles. 
SOUND: The wind, blowing ceaselessly. 
EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, AT THE EDGE OF THE BURYING GROUND 
LOUIS (awed) What is this place? 
JUD This was their burying ground, Louis. 
LOUIS Whose burying ground? 
JUD The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat. 
LOUIS Why? For God's sake, why? 
JUD I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right? 
LOUIS I guess so...but... 
JUD You want to rest a bit before you start? 
LOUIS No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin. 
JUD Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage. 
He hands him the pick and shovel. 
JUD I'm going to sit over yonder and have a smoke. I'd help you, but you've got to do it yourself. Each buries his own. That's how it was done then. 
JUD walks away, leaving LOUIS with the digging tools in one hand and the flashlight in the other. After a minute, LOUIS walks out into the burying ground. 
EXT.  LOOKING DOWN INTO A SHALLOW HOLE  NIGHT 
SOUND: The wind. It blows ceaselessly up here. 
The hole's about two and a half feet deep. Stubby rocks protrude from the sides. The pick comes down, hits a rock at the bottom, and flashes fire. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
He drops the pick and sticks his hurt hands in his armpits. Beside him we see a low pile of rocks and earth. 
JUD (voice) Should be deep enough. 
He joins LOUIS. He's got a lot of rocks in his arms. 
LOUIS You think so? 
He notices the rocks. 
LOUIS What are those for? 
JUD Your cairn. 
EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS'S POV 
Those tumbled piles of rock are very obvious. 
EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, BY CHURCH'S GRAVE 
LOUIS Doesn't look like they last long. 
JUD Don't worry about that. 
LOUIS Jud, why am I doing all this? 
JUD Because it's right. 
He walks off again. 
LOUIS looks after him for a moment, then kneels down. 
EXT.  LOUIS, BY THE GARBAGE BAG 
He opens it and looks in at CHURCH'S stiffening corpse. 
LOUIS Pax vobiscum, Church old buddy. You were a hell of a god cat. I doubt if you were worth all this aggravation, but you were a hell of a good cat. 
He tumbles the bag containing the body into the grave, and then begins pushing the stony soil over it with the spade. 
EXT.  THE CAIRN, CU  NIGHT 
LOUIS'S hands come into the frame and add a final two or three stones. 
EXT.  LOUIS, BY THE CAIRN 
He looks at it for a moment and stands up. JUD is right there. 
JUD That's fine. You did real good. 
LOUIS looks at him. 
EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  NIGHT 
There's a light on in the kitchen, but that's all. There's silence at first, and then the PHONE STARTS RINGING. 
EXT.  LOUIS'S FIELD  NIGHT 
LOUIS and JUD are coming down the path with their tools and their lights. They are both clearly fagged out. 
SOUND, FAINT: The telephone. 
LOUIS Oh, shit! Rachel! 
He drops the tools and sprints. 
EXT.  THE CREED'S SIDE YARD, BY THE TIRE SWING 
LOUIS runs into the side yard. SOUND of the phone is louder. 
EXT.  THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE, WITH LOUIS

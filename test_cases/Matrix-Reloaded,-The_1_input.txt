FADE IN ON: 
Dark clouds below the inky remnants of the scorched sky. We hear  wind as we sail, like a glider, over the black atmosphere. 
We DIVE DOWN into the murkiness, through the clouds, into the   darker world of  the dead  surface of  Earth, the  desert of  the real.   The rotted skeleton of a massive city is sprawled everywhere. We  approach a fissure in the Earth's crust, and as we do, we hear the   increasing buzz of multiple hovercraft  engines. Blue flashes grow  in  intensity from the fissure. Radio voices,  indistinct at first, grow louder   as we approach the fissure. 
WOMAN (V.O.) 
"Six o'clock, 300 meters. We can't outrun 'em." 
MAN (V.O.) 
"I know. Can't tow this crate fast enough! We gotta ditch it!" 
We hear the voices as though we're listening to cops through a  police scanner. The woman is NIOBE, the captain of the lead ship, Sephora. 
NIOBE (V.O.) 
"Can't, the core is still good. And they've got 'The One.'" 
MAN (V.O.) 
"Oooh, our savior. Hed better be worth it." 
NIOBE (V.O.) 
"Shut up and make the exit. Hold on!" 
The azure glow  from the  fissure  is suddenly overwhelming.  A  tight convoy  of  three  HOVERCRAFT  explode  from  the  fissure,  traveling nearly straight up, like a   trio of massive locomotives flying   into the sky in tight formation,  linked together by tow cables.  The  blue glow has  been emanating  from  the  overworked flare  drives of   the first and third hovercrafts.  Between them, suspended by  tow  cables, is the dark, scorched,  and sliced NEBACHANEZZER. They  rocket upward, slowing as they reach the top of the arc. 
NIOBE (V.O.) 
"Woo-hoooh!" 
The rush to the ground, pulling up at the last second. The NEB  flails wildly between them. 
MAN (V.O.) 
"They're still on us!" 
More vehicles fly from the fissure. A massive army of SQUIDDIES  pours up onto the surface. 
INT. NEBACHANEZZER COCKPIT 
The NEB is slung between the two HOVERCRAFT, with the cockpit   facing backwards.  TRINITY,  MORPHEUS,  TANK,  and  NEO,  the  former  Thomas Anderson, crowd the cockpit. Helpless, the landscape speeds away  from them, while a wall of red-eyed SQUIDDIES speeds to them. 
It's been a mere TWO DAYS  since the realization of NEOS POWERS   and the defeat of AGENT SMITH. The slipstream whistles violently into  the interior  of the  ship, and  the crew  is cold,  tired, haggard,   and stressed beyond  belief as  they can  only watch  the action in  their knocked-out ship. 
MORPHEUS is on a headset. 
MORPHEUS 
"Niobe, theyre closing." 
NIOBE 
"How many?" 
MORPHEUS 
"Just a few. Maybe two or three. Hundred." 
INT. SEPHORA COCKPIT 
NIOBE, as regal as she is beautiful, sits at the controls of her  ship with her co-pilot, a younger female. All visible dials are redlined as they streak over the dark surface. 
NIOBE 
"Youve got a gift for understatement." 
INT. FREEDOM COCKPIT 
THE  FREEDOMS CAPTAIN,  a silhouette  in a  dark cockpit,  is flying blind. His cockpit is awash in the blue flares from NIOBES ship. 
His lieutenant, a shadowy female figure, reaches for the radar screen. As she does, we see her  bare shoulder fall into view, a  WHITE RABBIT tattoo is conspicuous. 
They switch their screens to the radar, squiddies right on their ass. 
MAN 
"Oh shit, were screwed. We gotta set down and EMP em." 
NIOBE (V.O.) 
"Too many!" 
EXT. FREEDOM HULL 
A racing SQUIDDIES  reaches the hull  and latches on,  striking up its cutting laser and ripping into the hull. 
INT. SEPHORA COCKPIT

GRUG Oh, oh, `Guy'. `Guy' is with them. Well thank you for bringing me that interesting Guy update! 
A BEAT - Ugga regards her husband 
UGGA Oh, okay. I'm gonna go up and why don't you join us when you stop being a big drag! 
Ugga climbs up the tree to be with the rest of the family. Grug isn't thrilled with Ugga's shot at him. He picks up two rocks and tries to make fire. 
GRUG Sleep pile? How about a story, huh? Anyone? 
Grug listens intently. All he hears is laughter. 
TREE TOP 
Thunk, Sandy Belt and Gran are sitting around a torch, listening to one of Gran's stories. 
GRAN And then Torg said "Know it? I drew it!" 
THUNK GRAN SANDY BELT Ha ha ha ha ha ha. 
THUNK That makes no sense. 
Ugga arrives and sits next to Guy. She takes in the scene. 
UGGA (TO GUY) I know it was hard for you to bring us along, but they had the best day of their lives... Thank you for that. 
A RUMBLE distracts Guy. He looks to the horizon. FIRES and SMOKE on the horizon mark the leading edge of the collapse. Eep comes to his side. 
GUY I want to show you something. 
Guy LIGHTS A TORCH and leads the Croods up, up, to the forest canopy. 
Guy BLOWS OUT his torch. The night sky is revealed in all its glory. The Croods are amazed. 
Music POUNDS as the spectacle SWEEPS around the Croods. Perched on the canopy of the forest the Croods seem to sit at the very brink of the universe. 
THUNK More suns in the sky than you can count. 
GUY Every sun that crosses our sky, comes to rest up there. 
EEP Tomorrow. 
GUY That's where we'll be safe. 
ON GRUG ARRIVING at the tree top. When he sees the stars he DUCKS back down, terrified. 
He overhears the rest of the conversation. 
Eep with tears in her eyes. 
EEP I'm going with Guy. 
Grug is beside himself with panic, sick at the thought of losing Eep. 
GRUG (WHISPERED) No. Not my little girl. 
EEP Come with us. 
UGGA I can't go without Grug. 
GRAN Well, that makes one of us. Count me in! 
UGGA Really Mom? Now? 
Grug continues to listen in. 
GRAN Grug has no idea how to protect us. In fact, he has no ideas at all. 
UGGA No, that's not true. What about that one time when he a... 
GRAN Face it! If he actually had an idea of his own I'd, I'd have a heart attack and die!

INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS 
On a full sprint, Carrie dashes over to the Snowmobiles. Coughs. Spits blood. Doesn't stop her. She jumps on one. Fires it up. Uses her left palm to steer -- blood starts to seep through the gauze. She quickly bundles up, then guns it. 
Rubber treads grip. Smoke rises. She races it across the cement floor and out the hangar. 
EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS 
Off in the distance, Keller's heading for the front of the runway -- has to turn around to take off into the wind. 
Carrie veers off, targeting the tunnel to ASB.    Hits her light as she races in. 
INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS 
Carrie's light silhouettes Murphy and a couple of his guys as they head toward her. She doesn't even slow down as she blows right by them. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KELLER'S PLANE - SAME 
Desperation clings to his face as he turns the plane onto the runway. His wound oozes blood -- eats the pain as he gives it full throttle. Starts to pick up speed. Heads down his strip of freedom. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SIDE OF RUNWAY - OPPOSITE END - SAME 
A funnel of bumpy light spreads across the ice before Carrie on the snowmobile. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She holds tight as she burns a big U-TURN around one of the berms and onto the runway.   Heads straight for the lights of Keller's plane. 
INSIDE KELLER'S PLANE 
He sees Carrie. 
KELLER Crazy bitch. 
INTERCUT: 
She targets him like a Japanese zero.       Hundred yards and closing. 
He's pushing to get airborne.        Seventy-five yards between them. 
Gap narrows fast.    Fifty yards. 
Stay on Carrie. Looks like suicide. She suddenly swerves a hard left, disappearing behind a berm -- 
INSIDE WITH KELLER 
He bears a momentary sense of triumph, starts to get airborne -- until -- LAUNCHING UP OFF THE BERM is Carrie's snowmobile! She bails, letting it continue right toward him like a heat seeking missile as she tumbles down the berm. 
Keller's pov - a THOUSAND POUNDS of snowmobile comes at him fast -- obliterates the cockpit. 
SMASH CUT TO 
CARRIE'S POV - AS THE IMPACT 
Cripples the plane, pitching it sideways. A wing catches the runway, CATAPULTING the entire plane into a cartwheel of disaster as it veers off the runway and -- 
-- EXPLODES INTO A FIERY ERUPTION OF FLAME AND DEBRIS! 
Resume - 
Carrie slowly gets to her feet. The flames reflecting off her goggles. She heads to the wreckage. The cold and blowing snow extinguishing the flames quickly. 
AT THE WRECKAGE (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Carrie approaches. Only a sputtering of flame remains on the front of the twisted remnants of the Otter's cockpit. The aft seems relatively intact. Carrie looks in. 
Sees the charred and already frozen remains of Keller. In the back -- the charred duffle bag. She moves closer. 
Reaches in through a broken window.       Pulls it out to the runway. 
Unzips it.    Is confused.    No cannisters.   Only survival gear. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MEDICAL CLINIC - SOON AFTER 
Delfy, along with Murphy and his two guys, carry Pryce in. Doc's in the back room with two others, loading the BODYBAGS onto a cart.

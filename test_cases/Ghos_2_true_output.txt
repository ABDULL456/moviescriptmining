Willie rushes to the hallway, charges for the back stairs and stumbles down the three flights to the street. Carl, running down the corridor, rushes after him. Willie drops his gun. Carl picks it up. 
EXT. BROOKLYN STREET -- NIGHT 
Willie runs from the building and careens down the sidewalk. People clear a path as he hurls past them like a madman. Carl, confused, runs after him. 
Sam, too, races after Willie, unwilling to let him get away. 
Suddenly, a man obstructs his way. Willie goes flying over him and lands face down on the cement. Before he can get up, Sam is all over him and does not let up. People stand back to watch as Willie does battle with himself. Panicked, he calls out to a bystander. 
WILLIE Help me! 
People back away. Carl watches in terror. He understands exactly what is happening. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Willie, blinded by his own hysteria, runs wildly into the street. Cars are bearing down on him from all directions. He does not get out of their way. 
One driver sees Willie coming and swerves to avoid him. His car skids. Another car brakes to avoid a collision and suddenly both cars crash right into him. 
CARL Look out! 
Willie's body is crushed instantly between the two vehicles as his spirit is catapulted into the air still screaming and writhing. His ghostly form reaches out to people for help as they rush past. No one stops. 
Willie spins around and sees a mangled body crumpled on the street. Suddenly, he recognizes that it is his own dead body lying there. He begins to scream. 
A bizarre and frightening CLICKING SOUND fills the air. Sam looks up. A group of strange dark figures has emerged from the shadows. 
With a loud, terrifying shriek, the dark forms swoop down and grab hold of Willie. Sam freezes. In an instant they are dragging Willie, kicking and screaming, down through the sewer grates into the bowels of the earth. 
ANGLE 
Sam backs against a wall in absolute horror. Carl, standing in the crowd, turns and runs. 
INT. OLD LADY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Oda Mae and her sisters are huddling with the old woman in the entryway to her apartment. They all appear frightened. The door is opened a crack and they can see people gathering in the hall outside. 
Sam walks up to Oda Mae. She feels his presence. 
ODA MAE Sam? What happened? 
SAM He's dead, Oda Mae. 
ODA MAE Dead! (she utters a sigh of relief) Oh, thank God. It's over. 
SAM No. It's not over, Oda Mae. There's still Carl. 
Oda Mae freezes. She turns to Sam. 
ODA MAE Who's Carl? 
INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT 
Sam and Oda Mae are in a taxi speeding downtown. 
SAM Tell him to hurry! 
ODA MAE Can't you hurry up? 
DRIVER Listen, lady, I'm going as fast as I can. 
Sam leans forward and pushes at the gas pedal. The cab shoots forward. The driver seems shocked. 
ODA MAE Problems? 
He gives her a dirty look. 
INT. LOFT - NIGHT 
There is a KNOCK at the door. Molly goes to it. Fastening the latch, she opens it a crack. 
MOLLY Carl, is that you? 
Oda Mae wedges her foot inside. 
ODA MAE Molly, it's Oda Mae. I know what you think of me, but your life is in danger. You have to listen to me. Sam's here, too. You gotta let us in. 
Molly tries to slam the door but hits Oda Mae's foot. 
MOLLY Get the hell out of here. I'm calling the police. 
ODA MAE Go ahead. We want you to call 'em. You're in trouble. Let us in. 
MOLLY No! 
ODA MAE Sam's death was no accident. He was murdered, Molly. Carl was laundering money at the bank. Sam found out. He's dangerous. He tried to kill me. He'll kill you, too.

GUS I'm in love with you. 
That gets her attention. 
GUS You heard me. 
HAZEL 
AUGUSTUS -- 
GUS I'm in love with you. And I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you. (shrugs, matter-of-fact) Sorry. At which point, the Waiter reappears. 
WAITER More stars? Hazel is still too speechless to respond, her eyes fixed on Gus. Eventually Gus answers for them. 
GUS Just the check, please. 
WAITER No, sir. 
(BEAT) Your meal has been paid for by Mr. Van Houten. Gus raises his eyebrows at Hazel. This Van Houten guy is something else. 
EXT AMSTERDAM CANALS - LATER Hazel and Gus on a park bench, his arm around her, looking out over the water. Seeds blow from the elm trees and the reflections of the city ripple in the water below them. Hazel leans into his body, just a little. They stay like that, savoring the best night of both of their lives. CUT TO: 
EXT AMSTERDAM - HOTEL - ESTABLISHING A crisp Spring morning in Amsterdam. The buzz in the air outside is equalled by the buzz in: 
INT HOTEL ROOM - SAME Where Hazel excitedly paces through the room. 
FRANNIE I really don't get that shirt. Hazel wears a screen print t-shirt of Magritte's "Ceci N'est Pas Une Pipe." (A painting of a pipe with words below that mean "This is not a pipe.") 
HAZEL Van Houten will get it. Trust me. There are like fifty Magritte references in "Imperial Affliction." 
FRANNIE 
(READING) "This is not a pipe." 
HAZEL Exactly. 
FRANNIE But it is a pipe. 
HAZEL No it's not. It's a drawing of a pipe. See? 
(SHE DOESN'T) All representations of a thing are inherently abstract. A drawing of a thing is not the thing itself. Nor is a t-shirt of a drawing of a thing the thing itself. Frannie is still at a loss but she's impressed. 
FRANNIE When did you get so grown up? I feel like it was yesterday I was telling 8-year old Hazel why the sky was blue. You thought I was a genius back then. 
HAZEL Why is the sky blue? 
FRANNIE 
(BEAT) Because I say so. A knock on the door. Gus pokes his head in. 
GUS Who's ready for some answers! 
EXT. VONDELSTRAAT ROW HOUSES - LATER 
Gus and Hazel stand outside Van Houten's white house. 
HAZEL I'm so excited I can barely breathe. 
GUS As opposed to other days...? She playfully hits him. He takes her arm, picks up the oxygen tank, and up they go towards his front door. As they approach, there's a noticeable NOISE coming from inside the house. It's the deep thump of a BASS BEAT. Loud. Like, obnoxiously loud. Hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks. They wait. There's no response. 
GUS Maybe he can't hear over the music? Gus tries again, this time with more force. Still nothing. He tries a third time. Finally, the music stops. They wait. Still excited. A moment later the door swings open. It's a MAN IN PAJAMAS (60s), with a huge potbelly, thinning hair, and a week-old beard. All he says is: 
MAN IN PAJAMAS What?! Gus and Hazel look to one another. Could it be? 
GUS Mr. Van Houten? At which point, the Pajama Man slams the door in their faces. Hazel and Gus are too stunned to react. Through the closed door, they hear this: 
MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.) 
(SHOUTING)

CUT TO 
INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 
Gwen and the Desk Clerk board the elevator.  He presses "L" for lobby.  She presses "P" for parking. 
GWEN Thank you for taking care of the room. 
DESK CLERK Your welcome. 
And they ride in silence. 
In Gwen's mind-- 
GWEN ...And now the score is tied...Oh my God, what will I tell my mother?  I did it with a desk clerk.  Hardly the affair to remember...Of course, she will disapprove.  "Is English even his first language? This is your idea of a liaison?  Your idea of leveling the playing field?  You don't even know the boy's name--" 
Gwen touches the Desk Clerk's arm. 
GWEN What's your name? 
DESK CLERK David. 
GWEN What?  You're kidding me. 
Gwen laughs -- she can't help it. 
DAVID No.  What's so funny? 
GWEN Nothing, it's just-- 
She laughs even harder.  The elevator door opens.  David gets out and looks at her oddly. 
GWEN Sorry, I just...I didn't think you'd be named David. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY 
The door closes on Gwen, leaving David in the lobby.  A bit befuddled. 
INT. HOTEL FRONT DESK - DAY 
David resumes his post.  DESK CLERK #2 works beside him.  He leans to David-- 
DESK CLERK #2 There's a woman waiting to see you.  She's been here for half an hour. 
He points to a lobby chair, where we find ROSALIE -- 22, spunky, mercurial.  In short...trouble. 
She and David made eye contact.  She springs up and advances toward him. 
DAVID Why are you here? 
ROSALIE You weren't going to return my calls. 
DAVID Don't you have more important things to do?  Picking flowers, honeymoon reservations... 
ROSALIE Is there somewhere we can talk? 
The desk phone rings.  David picks it up. 
DAVID (into phone) 
Front desk, David speaking...No, sir.  Tap water is very drinkable in this city...Of course, sir.  We'll send up some bottled water right away. 
He hangs up. 
ROSALIE Is there somewhere we can talk? 
DAVID What's wrong with here? 
ROSALIE Privately. 
DAVID But here, I won't be tempted to raise my voice or do something rash.  That's the first lesson of hotel management.  Never lose your cool, no matter how annoying the guest is.  Not that I plan to go into hotel management.  I don't have ambitions in that direction.  Or any direction, if I recall you correctly. 
The desk phone rings again.  Exasperated, David grabs it. 
DAVID (into phone) 
Front desk, David speaking...Yes, ma'am, the restaurant has a smoking section...Well, I didn't make the policy...If it's any consolation, the smokers are seated in a little corner of the patio, and they feel very bad about themselves. 
He hangs up.  And gives Rosalie a very deliberate look. 
DAVID Rosie, you'd better leave.  Before I get myself fired. 
She starts to protest.  Thinks better of it, and exits.

A slender, dapper gent moves towards us on the river bank. LADY MANSFIELD Now I have checked and he has no London home, but I have good information he achieves an income no less than four thousand a year! 
ELIZABETH's mouth falls open.... MR VAUGHAN Miss Murray. Lady Mansfield. 
ELIZABETH curtseys. MR VAUGHAN (CONT'D) I trust your stay in London is proving pleasant, Miss Murray. 
ELIZABETH (earnest) Oh most certainly. MR VAUGHAN Miss Murray, I wonder, if you might permit me to call upon you at home, sometime? 
ELIZABETH Oh! She looks to her mother, stunned, his gaze follows... 
MR VAUGHAN With her Ladyship's permission? LADY MANSFIELD I shall make arrangements. ON DIDO, as OLIVER chats to others. She moves past as... 
LADY ASHFORD A pity Lady Mansfield and I could not do business on James and Miss Murray. 
LADY MARY A greater pity you rejected her. 
LADY ASHFORD Let us not dwell on the unfortunate. Oliver and Miss Lindsay are a blissful match. Tell me, when exactly does she receive her inheritance? As DIDO observes her reflection in waters - easy laughter floats by - a group of gentleman josh. 
A figure beside her turns - icy blue stare takes her in as she meets his gaze and finds herself staring into the eyes of JAMES ASHFORD. JAMES ASHFORD. Miss Lindsay. Not Husband hunting, are we? (off Dido's disdain) Good Lord, I forgot - you have ensnared my brother. Now is he to share his dining room with you, as well as his bed?? His words bury deep and painful. 
DIDO Oh, Mr James, your manners are as poor as your brother's finances. 
JAMES And you are foolish enough to marry him. I on the other have no better use for your impoverished cousin!...(beat)...Though she does make for rather amusing sport! 
She follows his gaze through trees to ELIZABETH breathing in the scent of the azaleas beside MR VAUGHAN. The joshing gentlemen trickle away leaving only DIDO and JAMES. She goes to move off. JAMES grabs her arm, spitefully. DIDO That is painful, sir. JAMES Have you never been manhandled? 
DIDO It is not in my repertoire to keep company with beasts. 
He regards her - her disdain reflected in his eyes. His free hand comes up, fingers rest on her lips, then spread, as he crushes her beauty in his hand. Her eyes fill as he brings her close. So close. She is afraid, angry. She struggles desperately, spirited, both arousing and alarming him. As she tears herself from him 
DIDO (CONT'D) How dare you? HOW DARE YOU! 
He stares at her - takes her in, calmly. Then... JAMES With ease. 
DIDO wavers nauseous with contempt.   JAMES moves off.   She watches, incensed, humiliated. 
ELIZABETH strolls with MR VAUGHAN, as JAMES passes OLIVER, he whispers to his brother. 
JAMES (CONT'D) You will destroy us. You will destroy the entire order of our family. Nearby, DIDO emerges from the trees... LADY ASHFORD Oliver has been searching for you! 
LADY MANSFIELD notes DIDO'S odd demeanour, LADY MARY too. Her eyes dart suspiciously to JAMES as he approaches. LADY MANSFIELD Are you unwell, my dear? DIDO's affected eyes come up to meet her mother's. She goes to answer...interrupted as...ELIZABETH gasps overwhelmed...

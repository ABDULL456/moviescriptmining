Coffey releases the ROV with the gripper and makes a grab at Bud with the steel claw.  Bud dives.  The gripper hits his helmet a glancing blow.  Bud kicks away rapidly, letting nylon rope pay out.  We see he has managed to tie one end to Geek's skids.  Coffey hits the button to activate the ROV, sending an acoustic pulse to Geek's transponder.  The little robot, pregnant with its load of death, turns nimbly around and dives out and down toward the void. 
Coffey pivots his bid machine toward Bud.  Bud strokes rapidly to a large jumble of wreckage.  He loops the rope around a twisted pipe.  Big Geek is hauling ass away from him.  The line snap taut an instant later.  The ROV strains, like a Rottweiler on a leash... trying to go.  The rope is slipping as Bud fights to make a knot. 
Flatbed slews around, thrusters whining.  As it banks, it hurls up clouds of sediment from the escarpment face. 
Through the front panel we see Coffey jerking on the controls. 
The big arm extends menacingly.  The smaller from manipulators open.  An enormous predatory instinct, its lights blaring. 
The big machine roars forward.  Straight at Bud. 
Bud gets his knot partly done.  See Flatbed looming. 
Glare-lit in its lights, Bud grabs a handlehold and pulls himself downward as Coffey closes the last few feet. 
One manipulator slams into his backpack, tumbling him, and the sub's underside rakes across his legs as it passes over.  Flatbed crushes into the tangle of pipework.  K-CRUUUNCH!! 
INT. FLATBED                                                            182 
Coffey is slammed hard over the controls, up into the front dome port.  He gets back in the seat.  Strains to free his machine. 
EXT. DEEPCORE/BIG GEEK/FLATBED                                          183 
Bud swims clear, diving down at an angle along the wall, hoping to stay in Coffey's blind area.  Flatbed backs out of the wreckage in a cloud of debris. It pivots toward Bud.  Moves after him. 
Nearby, the ROV is whining mindlessly, trying to please.  Trying to GO. DETAIL OF ROPE attached to wreckage, as Bud's knot begins to slip.  The nylon line starts to play through the knot slowly. 
BUD has gotten himself into a bad position.  Along the bare rock face of the cliff wall he is naked, nailed in the spotlights like a rabbit in front of a truck.  Coffey puts the hammer down, thrust levers all the way forward. Flatbed surges forward, multi-limbed and demonic.  There's no cover, side to side, up or down. 
Coffey has him head in his lights.  Suddenly a bright glare blasts in, blinding Coffey.  He looks up to see Cab One rushing down upon him, full throttle. 
At the last moment LIndsey slams the thrusters full-lock and the submersible slews sideways, slamming its heavy skidplate into Flatbed's cab.  Coffey is smashed sideways by the shock.  He fights to control his vehicle.  Lindsey looks up to see Coffey's sub gun it up over the wall, out of sight.  She cruises up over Bud. 
LINDSEY (V.O.) Get in! 
Bud gets the lockout hatch open and clambers up into Cab One's belly. 
INT./EXT. CAB ONE                                                       184 
Bud flops over the lip of the hatch and slams it shut.  He ditches his helmet. Lindsey raises her vehicle warily above the wall.  Through the front port there is not sign of Coffey. 
LINDSEY You owe me one, Virgil. 
BUD Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek. 
He points.  Through the front port, they can see the ROV still straining at its leash.  Lindsey dives toward it, simultaneously working the controls to open her own small manipulator claws. 
EXT. DEEPCORE/WALL, ETC.                                                185 
The last few feet of the rope slip through the knot. 
Big Geek happily surges forward.  It dives gracefully down into the void, trailing the yellow rope like a kite tail. 
ONE CAB ONE, Bud and Lindsey through the front port. 
BUD Go after it!  We gotta catch it! 
FLATBED DROPS INTO FRAME BEHIND THEM, dwarfing little Cab One.  They are slammed viciously as Coffey's submersible hammers into them.  She hits full throttle.  Coffey floors it after Lindsey, ramming her from behind with his more powerful vehicle.  With difficulty Lindsey maintains trim. 
She arcs back toward the rig.  Flatbed slams her again, for the side.  She fights for control. 
INT./EXT. CAB ONE                                                       186 
Bud is tossed around, ricocheting off the walls.  Lindsey flies with her jaw set.  Fighting hard for control.  The A-frame of the rig looms before her. She shoots through at full throttle. 
EXT. DEEPCORE AND OCEAN TERRAIN                                         187 
Now the fight is really on.  The two subs are dodging between the cylindrical modules at full throttle, slamming into each other and the steel pressure hulls. 
Coffey sideswipes the smaller sub, jamming it sideways.  It screeches along the flank of one of the trimodules. 
They head out over empty terrain in a flat-out speed run. 
Lindsey is jinking and dodging as Flatbed, roars along behind her, tearing up the bottom with its powerful backwash.  Lindsey carves hard around a rock pinnacle, finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal canyon. Coffey is ramming, hammering from behind, then from side to side. 
Lindsey snarls.  He's pissing her off.  He shouldn't do that. 
Ahead, out of the blackness, another outcropping. 
Lindsey rises, cuts right. 
Smashes down into Coffey's craft.  Timing it just right.  He skids catch in the rocks. 
Flatbed slews violently, nosing down.  Crushing into the rocky bottom. Pressing the advantage, Lindsey hammers into Flatbed from behind. 
It smashes full force into a second spire, spinning out of control. 
Tangles together, the subs slide down an embankment toward the edge of the wall.  With her one remaining thruster she jerks clear of Flatbed and grounds her crippled sub.  Flatbed tumbles over the edge.

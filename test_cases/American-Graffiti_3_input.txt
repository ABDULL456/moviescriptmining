He takes her hand from the tucked-under-the-chin position and puts it around him, in a bear-hug. 
LAURIE You take me out? When we first met you didn't have enough sense to take the garbage out... I asked you out, remember? 
STEVE What do you mean, you asked me out! 
LAURIE Backwards Day--remember? If I had waited for you to ask me--even after that you didn't call me for two weeks. 
STEVE I was busy. 
LAURIE You were scared. Dave Oboler told me. Then when you did ask me out you didn't kiss me for three dates. 
STEVE Well--I was-- 
LAURIE Scared--Jim Kaylor told me. I even asked my father why you hadn't kissed me. 
STEVE Your father--great! 
LAURIE He said he thought you were bright and you'd probably think of kissing me after a while. 
He moans. 
LAURIE You didn't, of course. I had to. Remember that picnic? 
STEVE Out at the canyon? 
LAURIE Oh boy! You can't remember anything-- the first one, up at the lake. That was the first time you kissed me--I practically had to throw myself at you. 
STEVE (quietly) I remember. 
They continue to dance slowly. Laurie starts to cry, hating herself for it. Steve loosens a minute and looks at her. 
STEVE What's wrong? 
LAURIE Go to hell. 
He holds her tighter and they circle the floor, all alone, the crowd watching quietly, the gym echoing with "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." 
THE GYM PARKING LOT 
Curt is leaning against a car in the parking lot. He's looking up at the stars and listening to the music floating out from the gym. 
WENDY What are you doin', stealing hub caps? 
A pretty, dark-haired girl, Wendy, slides up next to him and leans against the car. There's an awkward pause like that which happens often when two people who used to be close meet after things have changed. 
CURT Well--hey, Wendy. 
WENDY How've you been? 
CURT Fine. Great. How've you been? 
A horn honks and Wendy turns to a VW that's idling nearby. 
WENDY I'm coming--wait a sec. (turning back to Curt) She's got her car. Hey, I thought you were going away to school. 
CURT Ah, maybe... maybe. 
WENDY Same old Curt. All the time we were going together you never knew what you were doing... well, anyway, I gotta go. 
CURT Hey, Wendy--where are you going? 
WENDY Nowhere. 
CURT (smiling at her) Well, you mind if I come along? 
WENDY (affectionately) Okay. 
CURT Okay. 
They go off toward the VW and climb in. 
BACK INSIDE THE GYM 
The hop is almost over and the lights have been lowered, conservatively. Steve and Laurie hold each other, hardly moving and he kisses her. Still kissing, they continue to circle slowly--until a short, totally bald teacher comes and pokes Steve in the side. 
MR. KROOT All right, Bolander, break it up. You know the rules. You and your panting girlfriend want to do that you'll have to go someplace else. 
He gives them a disgusted look and starts off. 
STEVE Hey, Kroot! 
The teacher turns, surprised by the omission of "Mr."

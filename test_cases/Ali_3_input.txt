ALI I can move my jaw with my tongue. He got me... 
Pacheco looks into his mouth. 
PACHECO (concerned) It's broke. I think...I think your jaw's broke. 
Meanwhile, Ali spots... 
REFEREE 
curious about the activity in Ali's corner, starts over... 
PACHECO nods to Dundee. Dundee starts to reach. Ali snatches Angelo's hand holding the towel. Angelo's about to end the fight... 
ALI Ain't stoppin' nothin'...! (glares at them) Nothin' stoppin'...! 
A BELL sounds and Ali goes out to fight in an OVERHEAD SHOT. 
BURN OUT TO WHITE: 
INT. SAN DIEGO SPORTS ARENA, ALI AND HIS CORNERMEN + SECURITY - NIGHT 
leave the ring and another defeat, as they move up the aisle towards the locker room... 
INT. ALI'S WOODLAWN AVENUE HOUSE (CHICAGO), LIVING ROOM - ALI - DAY 
watching television. The place is a huge mansion on Chicago's South Side. 
HERBERT Now that Smokin' Joe's run out of tomato cans to beat up, I finally got Yank to commit to a rematch with you in about six months. Frazier said he'd be happy with three mil... (beat) 
WIDEN TO INCLUDE THE LIVING ROOM WITH BINGHAM, ALI'S TWINS -- RASHEEDA AND JAMILLAH -- MUHAMMAD, JR. AND MARYUM 
HERBERT (CONT'D) I'll fly to Jamaica and get Yank to sign right after Joe beats this big stiff. (to TV) 
OVER ALI:    CONSOLE TV 
They watch the Frazier-Foreman fight from Jamaica amid the wonderful chaos generated by kids and their toys, who crawl all over Ali as if he were furniture. Frazier and Foreman are in the center of the ring... We SEE Don King in Frazier's corner. 
ALI (through still-wired- together jaw) Foreman call me one time after he won the Olympics... 
Meanwhile, Frazier bobs and weaves, ducks and moves like he did with Ali. Joe throws a left hook, leaning forward with it. Before it lands, Foreman unleashes a hard right that jolts Frazier SIDEWAYS. Frazier throws another hook that misses. Foreman hits him with a combination of right and three lefts...two hooks and an uppercut that LIFTS FRAZIER OFF THE GROUND. Ali leans in to SEE... 
HOWARD COSELL (shouting) DOWN GOES FRAZIER! DOWN GOES FRAZIER! 
ON TV:    THE RING 
Frazier stands. The referee does the mandatory eight-count. Foreman bangs Frazier into the corner and blasts him again. Frazier tries to muscle out of the corner. Foreman lifts and throws him back into the corner. Foreman's power is unreal. Frazier is the man who beat Ali. Now, Frazier feints and slides sideways, and Foreman hits him in the back of the head. Frazier goes down again. It is savage. Here is a new world champion: George Foreman. 
BINGHAM (wry) B-b-be easy gettin' a Frazier fight now. He ain't the champ of anything except getting knocked down. 
INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN (ALI-FRAZIER II) - HANDS + ARMS - NIGHT 
grabbing. Holding. Ali's got Joe's powerful left tied up this time. A clinch. Separating. A punch. A hook. Clinching. They separate... 
OVER JOE: 
Ali, having Joe at the right range, hits him. Joe moves in. Ali DRAGS him closer and ties him up. They dance... 
THEIR BODIES 
Ali does a little shuffle, circles to keep Joe at hitting distance, lands a combination. Joe closes, but Ali won't let him in and ties up Joe. We hear a BELL and that's the end of the fight. Not a bang; a whimper. 
REFEREE 
holds up Ali's hand and mouths silently words we cannot hear. And as we MOVE CLOSER INTO ALI'S EYES, we see no exaltation. This is a victory, but a hollow one. It's a decision eked out. 
INT. NEW YORK COFFEE SHOP - WIDE 
The inner circle:    Ali, Pacheco, Dundee, Bundini, Bingham. 
ALI So. 
ANGELO DUNDEE So we only eked this one out. And George Foreman makes Frazier look like a sissy. 
PACHECO You see their fight? 
HOWARD BINGHAM You mean the Joe Frazier falling- down lesson? 
PACHECO And Foreman is 24. You are 32 years old. I don't want to see your head get turned into someone's bull's-eye. 
ANGELO DUNDEE ...but, you go? We're the corner, same as always. But it ain't gonna be easy. 
ALI (to Angelo) You think I still got the tools? 
ANGELO DUNDEE You got the tools, Daddy.     But they different. 
ALI (thinks; decides: go) Well, you better sharpen 'em up. 'Cause we goin' to Africa. BUNDINI The motherland. From the root to the fruit. We gonna rumble...in the jungle. 
ALI It's time to be heavyweight champion of the world again. 
BUNDINI Yeah, man!

We see the angry green giant thrash around in zero gravity. 
We see Hulk closer to the camera now, looking stressed and car sick. 
THROW FOCUS to see Banner's face watching the video, Hulk's freaked out face is super-imposed over Banner's freaked out face. 
BANNER (CONT'D) Thor, where are we? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16               76. 
THOR Yeah, about that. 
Banner hears: 
GRANDMASTER (O.S.) It's bad news, bad news today. 
Banner rushes over to the windshield.   Through it he sees- 
-Grandmaster, his hologram projection towering over the city. 
GRANDMASTER (CONT'D) Sakaar, hear ye. Attention please. I have some bad news. My beloved, exalted Champion has turned up missing. Take to the streets. Celebrate my champion. 
BANNER Who's that? 
THOR He kind of runs the place. You actually lived in his house. 
Back to Banner.    A distant, confused stare. 
BANNER I did? 
THOR Yeah. Quite a lot's happened. You and I had a fight recently. 
BANNER Did I win? 
THOR No, I won. Easily. 
BANNER Doesn't sound right. 
THOR Well, it's true. 
GRANDMASTER It seems that that criminally seductive Lord of Thunder has stolen him away. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                    77. 
THOR Seductive GOD of Thunder.    We need to move. 
BANNER Oh, no. This is bad. This is really, really bad. Thor, I think I'm freaking out. 
THOR No, no, no. Don't freak out. You're okay. Put these on. 
Thor tosses Banner some clothes.    Banner looks at them. 
BANNER These are Tony's clothes. 
THOR I know, come on. 
BANNER Is he here? 
THOR No, he's not here. But listen. Just stay calm, okay? The sun's going down. The sun's getting really low. Sun's going down. 
67   INT. GRANDMASTER'S CHAMBERS - DAY                                 67 
Loki and Valkyrie are brought before Grandmaster, who has at least tripled the amount of bodyguards around him. 
GRANDMASTER I'm upset! I'm very upset. You know what I like about being upset? Blame. Right now, that's the mindset that I'm in. And you know who I'm blaming? 
LOKI Grandmaster, I- 
GRANDMASTER Hey! Don't interrupt me! 
Topaz hands the melt stick to the grandmaster. 
TOPAZ Here you go. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   78. 
GRANDMASTER Why are you handing me the melt stick? He was interrupting. That's not a capital violation. (refocuses) My precious champion has come up missing and its all because of that Lord of Thunder. It's all because of him. (to Loki) YOUR brother. Whatever the story is. Adopted, or complicated. I'm sure there's a big history. (to Valkyrie) And YOUR contender. 
LOKI My dear friend, if you were to give me twelve hours I could bring them both back to you. 
VALKYRIE I can do it in two. 
LOKI I could do it in one. 
GRANDMASTER You know what? I woke up this morning thinking about a public execution. But for now, I'll settle for this sweet little "who's gonna get him first?" So you're on the clock. 
64   INT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - DAY                                  64 
Valkyrie exits in a hurry.   Loki follows her. 
LOKI What have you done!? 
Val reverses position, putting Loki up against the wall. 
VALKYRIE I don't answer to you, lackey. 
LOKI It's Loki. And you will answer to the Grandmaster. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  79. 
Loki moves to reverse position again, but Val BREAKS AWAY, drawing her TWO BLADES. In response, Loki UNSHEATHES two long Sakaarian daggers. They eye each other, and then- 
-FIGHT! A fast-paced and deadly battle of knives. After a few exchanges, Val connects a BIG SHOT that SLAMS Loki into the wall. He scowls. 
LOKI (CONT'D) Why would you help my brother escape with that green fool? 
VALKYRIE I don't help anyone. 
Loki trails off.   He sees her wrist markings.   A realization.

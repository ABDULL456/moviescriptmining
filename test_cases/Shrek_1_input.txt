FIONA And why not? 
SHREK Because- - Because he's just marring you so he can be king. 
FARQUAAD Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him. 
SHREK He's not your true love. 
FIONA And what do you know about true love? 
SHREK Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - - 
FARQUAAD Oh, this is precious. The ogee has fallen in love with the princess! Oh, good Lord. (laughs) 
The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Laugh'. The whole congregation laughs. 
FARQUAAD An ogre and a princess! 
FIONA Shrek, is this true? 
FARQUAAD Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away from our "happily ever after." Now kiss me! (puckers his lips and leans toward her, but she pulls back.) 
FIONA (looking at the setting sun) "By night one way, by day another." (to Shrek) I wanted to show you before. 
She backs up and as the sun sets she changes into her ogre self. She gives Shrek a sheepish smile. 
SHREK Well, uh, that explains a lot. (Fiona smiles) 
FARQUAAD Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! I order you to get that out of my sight now! Get them! Get them both! 
The guards run in and separate Fiona and Shrek. Shrek fights them. 
SHREK No, no! 
FIONA Shrek! 
FARQUAAD This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that makes me king! See? See? 
FIONA No, let go of me! Shrek! 
SHREK No! 
FARQUAAD Don't just stand there, you morons.

SYKES (laughing; cackling) 'They?': by 'they, are just plain and fancy 'they.' 'They.' (dancing around them his high laughter splitting the night) Caught you, didn't they? Tied a tin can to your tail -- didn't they? Lead you in and waltzed you out -- Oh my what a bunch -- big tough ones -- standing around with a handful of holes -- a thumb up your ass and a big grin to pass the time of day with. 122 TECTORSWINGS AT HIM, BUT THE OLD MAN DUCKS, then falls and rollsaway, still laughing. Tector starts'to follow, Pike stepsbetween them. 
PIKE Railroad men -- Pinkertons -- bounty 
HUNTERS 
(THEN) .Deke Thornton. 
SYKES (in disbelief ) Deke Thornton? -- He was with. them? 
LYLE (as Pike doesn't answer; 
QUIETLY) How come you didn't know? 
123 PIKE TURNS AWAY. DUTCH LOOKS AT PIKE QUESTIONINGLY, THEN ALL TURN as the SOUND of laughter comes from behind. 
ANGEL IS SITTING AGAINST-THE WALL LAUGHING. 
ANGEL .(to Tector) Hey, gringo; You take my share. 
125 TECTOR WHIRLS, HIS HAND FLASHING FOR HIS GUN. 
126 BEFORE HE CAN DRAW ANGEL'S. EXPRESSION TURNS serious and a gun is suddenly in his hand covering the big outlaw. Angel smiles again...then pleads mockingly. 
ANGEL Don't kill me, gringo ...por favor... Take my share of the 'silver' -- but 
don't kill me, please. Tector tenses, almost snarling with rage.. 
PIKE ,k for it I Tector-, looking at Angel's gun, half turns to Pike. 
PIKE: (continuing; softly) Go on, fall apart! Lyle and Tector hesitate, their hands on their guns -- Dutch moves back into the shadows of the firelight, his rifle drifting across Tector. 127 ANGEL SMILES AND SLOWLY replaces his gun. 
\ DUTCH Let's walk soft, boys... 
128 LYLE, STILL MORE THAN HALF READY TO GO FOR HIS GUN, hesitates. 129 TECTOR LOOKS AT PIKE, DUTCH, ANGEL, T.HEN slaps his gun into his holster -- and moves away, but his hand is never far from the weapon.. 
130 THE GROUP STANDS MOTIONLESS FOR A MOMENT, THEN SYKES REACHES INTO HIS COAT, LIFTS OUT A BOTTLE,. SITS BY THE FIRE and hands'it to Dutch. Dutch sits by Sykes, takes a drink, offers the bottle to Tector, Tector hesitates, then hunkers down and drinks. Slowly the others.follow suit. 
DUTCH (as the bottle moves around) What's our next move? 
CONTINUED 
130 CONTINUED 
PIKE Agua Verde is the closest three days maybe -- then we sell the extra stock -- get some griib and the news and drift back to the border -- maybe a payroll -- maybe abank -- 
LYLE 
(GENTLY) Maybe that damned railroad: 
TEC TOR That railroad sire bsi hell ain't getting 4ny easier. â¢ 
SYKES 
(QUIETLY) And we,ain't getting any younger. For a moment, it looks like he'll get a smart answer in return, then: Lyle drinks and lifts the bottle to Angel who.crosses to.the fire,. drinks and passes it to Sykes. 
PIKE 
(FINALLY) .We got to start thinking beyond our guns -- theft days are closin' fast. 
LYLE (without malice) All your fancy planning and talk damn near got us shot to pieces for.some lousy bags of washers... Now this was goin.' to be our last job before we head south ...We spent all our time and money getting ready for this. 
PIKE 
(DRYLY) You spent your time and money running whores in Hondo while I spent my stake setting it up. LYLE CALMLY PICKS UP A WASHER, flips. it to (or at) Pike who catches it, looks at it, through it, drinks, tosses it back on the pile. 
CONTINUED 
CHANGE 
131 CONTINUED 
PIKE 
(TRUTHFULLY) Looks like I'd have been better off running whores than making plans9 stealing horses and buying uniforms. 1.32 THE MEN ARE SILENT FOR A LONG MOMENT. Then they break into soft laughter which builds slowly. 
LYLE (after a moment) He --.he was making plans while me and Tector was -- He breaks up and can't continue. 
DUTCH (his laughter growing) ,-While you was getting your bell rope pulled by -- (standing; almost choking) By two -- mind you, two -- Hondo whores -- while Pike's dreaming of washers - you're matching two of them -- in tandem And the wild bunch falls apart in laughter -- even Pike is caught, but as he laughs, he knows that they are together again.

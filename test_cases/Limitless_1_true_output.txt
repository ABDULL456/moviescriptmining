EXT. THE ORPHEUS ROOM - NIGHT 
Eddie simply stands there coolly; Kevin is nervously saying goodbye to Van Loon and Pierce, making small talk. 
KEVIN ..and, oh, you know, she's on the wait list... Rosemary's pretty devastated... 
VAN LOON My daughter went there. I'll call the school for you. 
Kevin blubbers with gratitude. Van Loon's car pulls up. Kevin pumps his hand. Van Loon looks past Kevin -- to Eddie. 
VAN LOON (CONT'D) Eddie. Ride? 
It's the first real acknowledgement that he's taken Eddie seriously. 
INT. VAN LOON'S LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT 
Eddie and Van Loon regard each other. Finally, Van Loon speaks. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
VAN LOON I don't know who you are, Eddie, or what your game is, but I'm sure of one thing: you don't work in this business. I'm up to my ass in investment guys, and you don't have their half-cocky, half-terrified line of bullshit. Which is not to say I like yours any better. 
He picks up a file, hands it to Eddie. 
VAN LOON (CONT'D) But you obviously pick your stocks in a way I haven't seen. So tell me. We're thinking of acquiring these companies. Take a few minutes. What's your take on them? 
EXT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Van Loon's limo pulls up. 
INT. VAN LOON'S LIMO - NIGHT 
Eddie snaps the file shut, hands Van Loon back his pen flashlight. 
EDDIE But these companies aren't the question, are they? 
VAN LOON What do you mean? 
EDDIE Well -- you're upmarket energy -- what do you want with these little solar/windmill/hippie outfits? 
Van Loon's gaze is expressionless. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) --Unless you wanted to play both sides of the fence, control the whole energy enchilada. But these wouldn't get you there in emerging markets. You'd need... 
He eyes Van Loon, who is sitting up straighter. Eddie's hit a nerve. He smiels, whistles. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
EDDIE (CONT'D) Whoa, whoa. This must be some big- ass merger you're contemplating. 
A flicker in Van Loon's eyes. Bullseye. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) And there's really only one company with enough bling to justify a merger with Van Loon Associates... 
VAN LOON Have you been talking to somebody-? 
EDDIE Carl, it's just rationalization. 
He says it like it's the simplest thing in the world. Which, to a person on MDT, it is. 
Van Loon grinds his teeth. Wanting to talk about it, but too skittish. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) Is Hank Atwood going to go for it? 
A long beat. 
VAN LOON You are either an amazing con artist or a very smart young man. 
EDDIE Come on -- the two of you together? The world would have to come to you begging for energy like Oliver Twist with his little bowl of gruel. 
A beat as the two men stare at each other. 
VAN LOON You realize that if the press got one whisper of -- I can't fucking believe I'm even discussing this-- 
EDDIE It doesn't matter. It won't come off. 
Now Van Loon chuckles, amused by Eddie's audacity. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
VAN LOON The word "brazen" does not even begin to go there. 
EDDIE You'd have to back off Libya. 
VAN LOON Why? He's come this far-- 
Eddie suddenly pulls back the bait. 
EDDIE I don't think you'd want to hear about it from some shmuck who needs a ride home.

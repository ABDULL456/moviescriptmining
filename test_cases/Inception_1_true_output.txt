COBB And we did... 
Mal looks at Cobb... thinking. Remembering. 
INSERT CUT: TWO ELDERLY PEOPLE (MAL AND COBB) WALK THROUGH LIMBO... ACROSS A WASTELAND... TWO ELDERLY HANDS CLUTCH EACH OTHER AS THEY LIE DOWN ON THE RAILROAD TRACK... 
COBB I miss you more than I can bear... but we had our time together. And now I have to let go... 
She nods, weakly. Cobb holds Mal as her eyes close... DYING... and we- 
INT. STRONGROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Fischer and his Father's body DROP AWAY- 
INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT 
Ariadne DROPS inside the ROCKETING ELEVATOR, and as it SMASHES INTO THE TOP OF THE SHAFT Ariadne SMASHES into- 
INT./EXT. VAN INTO RIVER - DAY 
THE WATER, THE VAN CRUNCHING WITH THE IMPACT- WATER CRASHING THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOWS FLOODING THE INTERIOR... 
Fischer's EYES OPEN, PANICKING- he UNBUCKLES HIMSELF, pushes out of the broken window- STOPS, goes back to UNBUCKLE Browning and DRAG him out. 
EXT. RIVER - CONTINUOUS 
Fischer breaks the surface with Browning, who COUGHS and GASPS. He starts PULLING for the near bank, struggling through the rain-impacted water- 
INT. VAN, UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS 
Ariadne, Arthur and Yusuf wait calmly underwater. They are sharing TWO REGULATORS pulled from beneath the front seat. Arthur turns to Saito. There is blood in the water around Saito's belly- his eyes are LIFELESS- Arthur feels for a pulse... turns to Cobb, whose eyes are lifeless... Ariadne GRABS Arthur's elbow, pulling him away... 
EXT. RIVERBANK - MOMENTS LATER 
Fischer turns Browning/Eames over. They lie there, exhausted. 
BROWNING I'm sorry, Robert. 
Fischer stares at the rain on the water. 
FISCHER The will means that Dad wanted me to be my own man, not live for him. (turns to Browning) ) And I'm going to, Uncle Peter. 
Browning nods. Wipes the rain from his face. In the puddle beside them, the reflection is not Browning, but Eames. 
EXT. UNDERNEATH BRIDGE IN THE RAIN - MOMENTS LATER 
Arthur sits on the riverbank, breathing heavily. 
ARTHUR What happened? 
ARIADNE Cobb stayed. 
ARTHUR With Mal? 
ARIADNE No. To find Saito. 
Arthur looks out at the water below the bridge. 
ARTHUR He'll be lost... 
ARIADNE No. He'll be alright. 
And we- 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DAWN. CRASHING SURF. 
The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand. 
As the Japanese Security Guard turns him onto his back, we realize that this is Cobb- OLDER. WEARY. TRAVELLED... 
INT. DINING ROOM, CASTLE - DAY 
Cobb WOLFS his food. The Elderly Japanese Man (Saito, 90 years old) watches him. 
SAITO So... have you come to kill me? 
Cobb does not look up. 
SAITO I've been waiting for someone to come for me... 
COBB Someone from your half-remembered dream...? 
Saito peers at Cobb. 
SAITO Cobb? Not possible-he and I were young men together. And I am an old man... 
COBB Filled with regret? 
Saito REMEMBERS, nods... 
SAITO Waiting to die alone, yes. 
Cobb is STARING at something on the table. 
COBB I came back for you... I came to remind you of what you once knew... 
Cobb gestures at the table. Saito follows his gaze down to the polished surface of the table... 
COBB That this world is not real. 
The top IS STILL SPINNING PERFECTLY, AS IF IT WILL NEVER TOPPLE. Saito looks at the top. Then back to Cobb. 
SAITO You came to convince me to honor our arrangement? 
COBB Yes. And to take a leap of faith. 
As Saito-san listens to Cobb, he looks at the GUN on the table between them... 
COBB Come back and we'll be young men together again. 
The elderly Saito looks at Cobb. Nods. And we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - DAY 
Ariadne watches Cobb. His eyes are closed.

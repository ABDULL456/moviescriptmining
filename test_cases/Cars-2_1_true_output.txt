EXT. LONDON STREET - MOMENTS LATER 
Holley, McQueen and Mater are now stopped. 
HOLLEY Mater, we've got to get that bomb off you. 
She's already SCANNING the bomb, working away. 
MCQUEEN Bomb? 
MATER Yeah, they strapped it to me to kill you as a back-up plan. 
MCQUEEN Back-up plan? Mater, who put a bomb on you? 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (O.S.) Ahhhhh! 
Professor Zundapp suddenly ROLLS to a stop next to (a now totally freaked) McQueen, entangled in grappling hooks care OF --- 
--- Finn, who has him leashed. 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (TO MCQUEEN) You. Why didn't my death ray kill you? 
MCQUEEN Death ray? 
FINN Turn off the bomb, Zundapp! 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Are you all so dense? It's voice- activated. Everything is voice- activated these days. 
MATER Deactivate! Deactivate! 
BOMB'S COMPUTER VOICE Voice denied. 
The BOMB suddenly TRANSFORMS into a TIME BOMB, now complete with a countdown mechanism from 4:59... 4:58... Mater GASPS. 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Oops. Did I forget to mention that it can only be disarmed by the one who activated it? 
Holley immediately shoves a GUN in Zundapp's grill. 
HOLLEY Say it! 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Deactivate. 
BOMB'S COMPUTER VOICE Voice denied. 
THE BOMB'S TIMER: It loses a full minute! Goes from 4:48 to 3:48 to 3:47... Mater GASPS. 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (GRINNING) I am not the one who activated it. Would anyone else like to try? 
ZZZZZZATTT! Holley shocks him unconscious. 
FINN (TO HOLLEY) You read my mind. 
HOLLEY He was getting on my nerves. 
MCQUEEN What do we do? 
VICTOR HUGO (O.S.) It's very simple. 
VICTOR HUGO blocks the entrance to a side street. He's surrounded by Hugo relatives. 
VICTOR HUGO You blow up. 
The four streets surrounding them are now blocked by each of the Lemonheads and their families. 
MCQUEEN (TO MATER) I'm gonna go out on a limb here. These are the guys that want me dead, correct? 
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV It's nothing personal. 
MATER (to the Lemons) Fellers, listen. (MORE) 
MATER (CONT'D) I know what you're going through. Everybody's been laughing at me my whole life too --- 
McQueen turns to Mater - he wasn't expecting that. 
The Lemons all eye each other, considering Mater's words. 
MATER --- but becoming powerful and rich beyond your wildest dreams ain't gonna make you feel better. 
J. CURBY GREMLIN Yeah, but it's worth a shot. 
WHOOM!!! He's BROADSIDED by a blast of water from O.S. 
It's Red! He's sitting outside an underground entrance, followed by Sally and the rest of the Radiator Springs gang. 
ALL OUT WAR ensues between the LEMONS, RADIATOR SPRINGS along with FINN and HOLLEY. 
FINN attaches his four-way cable hooks to the thugs and springs high in the air, crushing the four of them together. 
HOLLEY SPROUTS her wings, and knocks out two cars on her side. 
VARIOUS SHOTS OF RADIATOR SPRINGS KICKING BUTT: 
Guido pulls some LEMON tires off with his air gun. In seconds he has a stack of lugnuts next to him. 
GUIDO Pit stop. 
The two Pacers' tires all FALL OFF. 
Flo hits VLADIMIR TRUNKOV with her high-beams, BLINDING HIM. Sheriff BOOTS him. 
SHERIFF Not today, boys! 
Guido pushes away his tireless thug, YELLING AT HIM IN ITALIAN.

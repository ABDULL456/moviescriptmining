WAITRESS Shit! That was one of my good glasses! 
As she presumably cleans it up, we stay on STARKS who slowly gains hold of himself. She comes back, DRINK in hand and pushes the STRAND OF HAIR in her face back the same way she did when he saw her in the tunnel. Even through her weariness, she looks radiant under the Christmas lights. She takes a long SIP. 
WAITRESS [Noticing he's shaken] Hey, you ok? 
STARKS [Beat] Yeah, I'm fine. 
WAITRESS You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch. 
And sadly, no plans for the evening anyway. She looks back -- her EYES even more tired from the liquor. 
STARKS I'm not gonna hurt you. 
WAITRESS [Softly] I know. [Clearing her throat] I'm gonna go take a bath. Make yourself at home. You know, fix yourself something to eat if you're hungry or anything. There's nothing to steal, but don't be a jerk and take something anyway. And don't snoop, ok? 
STARKS Ok. [Beat] My name's William by the way. 
WAITRESS [Shakes her head] No, no. Let's not do the name stuff, 'cause you see, I don't want to meet you. I may want to help you tonight, but I don't want to know you. Honest. 
STARKS nods as she walks out. 
EXT. YARD BEHIND WAITRESS' APARTMENT, EVENING 
STARKS, still without a coat, collects some WOOD... 
INT. KITCHEN, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, EVENING 
STARKS looks in her fridge. There's not much to work with -- just some JARS and plenty of VODKA. 
INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, SOME TIME LATER 
STARKS has lit a FIRE and set out a feeble dinner for them when the WAITRESS comes out of the bedroom in sweats. 
WAITRESS What's this? 
STARKS The best I could do with what was in your fridge. She looks and sees a SANDWICH on a BUN in one plate and a SANDWICH on two different colors of TOAST on the other. 
Then she looks over at the fire; it's obvious from the way she looks at it that it's been years, if ever, since someone's done something like this for her. 
STARKS I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if... 
WAITRESS No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks. 
She turns and goes in the kitchen, calling out to him... 
WAITRESS You want a drink? 
STARKS Sure. 
INT. KITCHEN, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, NIGHT 
As she makes their DRINKS, a curious LOOK crosses her face, just for a second. 
INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, A LITTLE WHILE LATER 
They've sat down to eat under the blinking CHRISTMAS LIGHTS. 
WAITRESS This is pretty good. Considering... 
STARKS Thanks. 
They eat quietly for a second. STARKS looks at her, then down at his food, still subtly stunned by it all. 
STARKS So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing. 
WAITRESS Yup. That's me. 
STARKS You like it? 
WAITRESS [Beat] I do it. 
STARKS Have you always been a waitress? 
WAITRESS [Remembering sadly] No. I used to be a nurse. 
STARKS [Beat] Why'd you stop? 
WAITRESS Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from? 
STARKS I don't know, but I think part of it's... 
STARKS looks around as he decides to be honest with her. 
STARKS That I don't really know what's real. 
She stares at him until a small sympathetic smile appears on her lips. 
WAITRESS Well, good for you.

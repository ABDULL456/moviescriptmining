[Bragnae returns and interrupts their moment of tenderness] 
ISOLDE Tomorrow then? 
TRISTAN Tomorrow. 
[Tristan sits outside making a shell bracelet. Isolde shortly arrives. Inside the hut the scene continues] 
ISOLDE There she who bore you brought you forth. 
Set me as a seal upon your heart, 
As a seal upon your arm; 
For love is as strong as death, 
TRISTAN Ridiculous. 
ISOLDE I happen to believe what that says. Dont you think there is more to life? 
TRISTAN Than what? 
ISOLDE Something more than duty and death! Why are we capable of feelings if not to have them? Why long for things if they are not meant to be ours? Well dont listen to me. Youre so sure of things. Youre certainty, its like armour. I wish I had that. 
TRISTAN Why would you need it? 
ISOLDE The joy of being a lady? Wanting something I cant have. A life of my own. 
BRAGNAE Time for sleep now. 
ISOLDE Ill follow you later. 
BRAGNAE You need to rest. In case your betrothed should want to see you.

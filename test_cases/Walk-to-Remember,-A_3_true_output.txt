BANGING, RATCHETING, CLINKING. Landon's working hard.    A BOOM BOX playing SIMPLE MINDS' "Alive and Kicking." 
LANDON'S POV - HIS MOTHER'S LEGS 
and worn terry slippers appear. 
CYNTHIA (O.S.) I want to talk to you. 
He pauses, annoyed, then rolls himself out. 
EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY 
The mangled front bumper's on the ground. Cynthia stands there in her bathrobe. Upset. Landon's almost too much. 
CYNTHIA You're not hanging round here all day. 
LANDON I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car -- 
CYNTHIA You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin. 
LANDON 'Bout what? 
CYNTHIA About a job. 
Landon ignores her.    Slides back under his car. 
EXT. UNDER CAMARO 
CYNTHIA (O.S.) He's going to try you as assistant manager. (beat) You could be manager someday. 
Landon can't believe this. 
EXT. DRIVEWAY 
Landon slides back out. 
LANDON I'm not working there. 
Cynthia sets her jaw.   He knows that look. 
INT. RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - LUNCH HOUR 
Landon is sweating, scouring pots. A crooked cap on his head, an assistant manager name tag on his shirt. He's making some headway; only two more to wash. 
MARVIN, the owner, walks over. Beer belly, greasy hair. Dumps another pile of dirty pots and pans in Landon's sink. Landon glimpses his future. 
INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OUTER OFFICE - EARLY AFTERNOON 
Landon paces, jumpy. Kelly's secretary, MISS TARBOX, quietly locks her purse in her bottom drawer. 
LANDON Who's he in with? 
MISS TARBOX He'll be with you when he's available. 
The door to Kelly's office opens. Jamie Sullivan exits with her father, the tall stern REVEREND HEGBERT SULLIVAN. Jamie eyes Landon as she passes by. 
LANDON (joking) You expelled, too? 
Nobody laughs or even smiles. 
INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
Mr. Kelly makes a note in Jamie's file. 
MR. KELLY Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter? 
LANDON I want to come back. 
MR. KELLY (looking up, surprised) Back?   Were you ever really here? 
They both know Kelly has the upper hand.   Kelly leans back in his chair, relishing it. 
LANDON (mumbling) I want to graduate. 
Kelly studies Landon, the boy who can't get out of his own way. 
MR. KELLY (thinking aloud) You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community -- 
LANDON (relieved) I'd do that -- 
MR. KELLY How would you do that, Mr. Carter? 
Landon shrugs, clueless. 
MR. KELLY (smiling) Shall I give you a few ideas? 
LANDON (smiling, too) Please. 
MR. KELLY Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDON For pay? 
MR. KELLY For the inner satisfaction it will bring. (beat) Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school -- 
LANDON (joking) I'm as underprivileged as they are -- 
MR. KELLY The fact that you attend this school makes you privileged. 
His tone quiets Landon. 
MR. KELLY Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.

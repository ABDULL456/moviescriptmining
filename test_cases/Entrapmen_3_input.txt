A held beat.  His glance lifts beyond her shoulder. 
MAC Excuse me. 
And walks off toward a sleek custom TOURING CAR just pulling up. She goes after him. 
GIN I didn't know Porsche made things like this. 
MAC Well, they don't... 
Tipping the valet.  Sliding in... 
MAC ...as a rule. 
Shutting the door.  Through the open window, she hands something from her bag.  A plastic rectangle which OPENS into a slide viewer. She presses the light ON.  He looks at the slide. 
GIN Recognize that? 
No reaction. 
GIN My seller is in Shinjuku, we can go there tonight. 
She leans closer. 
GIN He wants 4.6 million.  I can get it for three. 
He hands it back.  Looks in her eyes. 
MAC No, you can't. 
And TAKES OFF.  Her jaw drops slightly, but in one fluid motion... 
She's hailed a cab. 
INT. IMPERIAL HOTEL BAR - LATER 
Graceful, timeless room, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in the '20s.  Burnished.  Elegant.  Way cool.  A place to drink, to deal, to dream.  PAN down the polished surface of the bartop, til we come to... 
...a tropical DRINK.  Cute little umbrella, tilted back toward the room.  ROTATE ANGLE to see... 
...INSIDE the umbrella, something small, something mechanical.  A woman's HAND ADJUSTS the point of the umbrella ever so slightly, and we PAN UP her arm to see... 
...Gin.  Still in her gown.  She is reading, with half-glasses, and one of the bows curls around her ear, which we CLOSE on to hear... 
...static.  Gin adjusts the drink umbrella, which is a directional mike, and hears... 
MAC (O.S.) ...only it's not bloody football! 
SNAP to Mac's table, well across the room.  Drinking giant beers with a large, really fat Japanese guy in a costly; if wrinkled, suit.  The hulk listens with stone attention to Mac's rant, as if he actually gave a shit. 
MAC (O.S.) ...it's just that crap Americans call 'football', like you could call your ass a butterscotch scone and have it be one! 
The guy nods seriously.  Maybe he's a Sumo dude. 
MAC Why you'd want to bring that foolishness to Japan, you're just pissing your investment down a bungee hole. 
SUMO GUY (major accent) You got Cubano this trip? 
That he does.  Mac pulls out a leather cigar holder, and passes it over.  Flat against one side is an ENVELOPE, which Sumo Guy PALMS skillfully, slipping it seamlessly INTO his pocket as he withdraws a small MATCH BOX.  Takes out one long cigar, lights up... 
MAC Seriously, put the money into pharmaceuticals or prostitution, something stable. 
The big guy pushes the cigar holder and match box back toward Mac. Opening the box, Mac sees one match and a small MICROCHIP fastened to the cardboard.  Lights up.  Slides the match box in his pocket. 
MAC Garbage, perhaps.  Or industrial plastics. 
ANGLE...Gin still engrossed in her reading.  A figure leans down next to her.  She startles, slightly.  So surprised to see... 
MAC My favorite thing in life. Coincidence. 
She gives him the great smile. 
GIN I'm staying here, what's your excuse? 
And now he smiles.  First time ever.  A little chilling, the way he does it. 
MAC Staying here, as well.  You are in room...? 
GIN (half a beat) One thirty-eight. 
In one motion, he flags the bartender... 
MAC Will you send a half-bottle of Chateau d'Yquem '67 to Room 138, please?  And some berries and chocolates for the lady to enjoy it with. 
He presses some currency into the barkeep's hand.  Turning back... 
MAC Actually, I was just across the room, dickering with a gentleman over the purchase of an interesting Spitzweg.  Until I determined the painting was apparently stolen... 
Oh.   She's shocked.  He agrees... 
MAC Goes against my grain.  The DeKooning in your slide, the 4.6 million you can get for 3.  Can you get it for 2 and a half? 
She looks in his eyes. 
GIN Sure. 
And as if he believed her... 
MAC My checkbook is in my safe.  You wait here. 
His smile evaporates.  He is gone before she can say...

She TURNS AROUND to see the crew. \nAMBER (cont'd) (surprised) Ahhh!  Je-sus-Christ-on-a-cross! (catching breath) Look, number one rule in a funeral home - never sneak up on the livin'. You never know who could have an embalming needle or skull saw in their hand.  Mr. Larson's son learned that the hard way - he's buried next to my Grandpa! \nAmber turns to the slab to continue working.

I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore. \nMR. LARSON Well, your \"cheap whore\" is this family's \"lovin' mother.\" (pointing at Brett) The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'.

But, in some kinda weird miracle, our neighbor boy, Kenny Johanson, found my tap costume on the roof-a their trailer while he was settin' coon traps for his dad.  Here's the weird part.  It was still on the hanger. \nDRESSING ROOM - HALLWAY \nCLOSE ON TESS WEINHAUS wearing \"I love German Shepherds\" sweatshirt, standing beside various trinkets. \nTESS And, uh, this is my lucky bolt.

LORETTA'S TRAILER - DAY \nAmber sits on the picnic table.  In the b.g., Loretta exits her trailer with a FED-EX GUY.  She pats his buns as he exits.  She approaches Amber with a packet. \nAMBER (V.O.) I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that.

TAPED MUSIC \"It's My Turn.\"  A NURSE pushes MARY JOHANSON out in her wheelchair, complete with portable oxygen.  Mary wears a gigantic black wig and silver gown which hangs off her boney body. She moves her lips to the words as the nurse pushes her emotionally around the stage. \nEXT. GYMNASIUM - HALLWAY \nContestants, in \"physical fitness\" outfits, wait outside the double doors, holding freshly painted red, white and blue step ladders.  Becky and Amber stare at each other from opposite ends of the line. \nIRIS All right, why don't we take up the stepladders, all right?  For the Physical Fitness number? \nBECKY (picking up her stool) They're wet. \nLISA Hey, my hands are stuck. \nMOLLY (sniffing) Uh, I'm kinda dizzy from the fumes. \nIRIS Well, hold kem away from you so it doesn't get on the outfits.

The question on everyone's mind:  What is...Soylent Green? \nShe sweeps her hand back across her face and she's \"in character,\" pained, near death, and overly dramatic. \nBACKSTAGE - LEFT - CONTINUOUS \nAmber, now in the leotard, talks to Iris.  Michelle performs from \"Soylent Green\" in the b.g. \nAMBER (loud whisper) Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me?  Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on? \nIRIS Amber, I'm sorry.

All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant. \nAMBER But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule? \nIRIS Sorry.  I-I don't make the rules. \nAMBER This, this... This is bullshit! \nIRIS Amber Atkins!  That is not American Teen Princess language! \nAMBER Good, kcause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant - it's, it's Nazi Germany! \nAmber storms off. \nIRIS (shaking head) Where do they get this stuff... \nINT. BACKSTAGE \nCAMERA FOLLOWS AMBER as she storms over to BACKSTAGE - RIGHT where Gladys watches Michelle ON STAGE. \nAMBER Mrs. Leeman? \nGLADYS (turning) Huh? \nAMBER I-I'm wearin' this costume.  I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight. \nGLADYS Oh really - I don't think so. (suddenly aware of camera) Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance.  And this... (pointing to costume) This is why we have the rule.  My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage.  We have kids in the audience. \nAMBER But, you - I mean... It's not my fault.  I-I... Please?  I didn't do anything wrong... \nAmber starts to cry. \nMICHELLE (climaxing) That's why... I must say...

So, how does it feel to be the new Mount Rose American Teen Princess, Becky? \nOLDER MEN turn and look at camera, then take out a pen and note pad. \nBECKY Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know?  I mean, I won!  I'm the winner!

MOUNT ROSE STREET - BACK TO DOCUMENTARY CAMERA \nPAN OVER to see Gladys helping Becky climb on the swan, unaware of camera.  In b.g., DOCUMENTARY CREW interviews Amber and Leslie on their convertible behind the swan float. \nGLADYS C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it.  Now get up there.  Ride it side-saddle if you have to - like a horse.  C'mon, now. \nBECKY It smells funny.  Like gasoline. \nGLADYS Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico. \nBECKY My dress'll reek. \nGLADYS Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny.  Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth. \nEXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER \nAmber and Leslie, in gowns, look unhappy as they stare straight ahead, exhaust fumes - that appear to come from the swan's ass - cover them and their old convertible. \nLESLIE Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck? \nAMBER Yeah... \nLESLIE And the bite marks on my ears? \nAMBER (slowly turning) Yes... \nLESLIE I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs. \nAMBER Yes, Leslie! \nEXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER \nHank rubs his head, then angrily gets out of the truck, SLAMMING THE DOOR ON ONE OF THE SUSPENDERS ON HIS OVERALLS.  He starts to walk, but can't, eventually leaning out from the truck - only moving his arms as if walking. \nEXT. MOUNT ROSE SIDE STREET - LATER \nHank, still stuck in the door, is being teased by a GROUP OF KIDS who poke at him with flags and sticks.

MOUNT ROSE SIDE STREET - LATER \nHank, still stuck in the door, holds the little kid by the back of the shirt in one hand and eats the kid's cotton candy with the other.  The kid struggles to get away.  A few BROKEN FLAGS are scattered on the ground. \nHANK Help...Hank!  Help...Hank! Help...Hank!  Help...Hank! \nON SWAN FLOAT.  Gladys approaches. \nGLADYS Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan. \nIRIS Uh, Gladys? \nGLADYS What! \nIRIS We need more bars! \nGLADYS This is -- what? \nIRIS Enid ate a whole pan! \nGLADYS I swear to God she can't do anything by herself. \nEXT.

The swan's back eventually collapses taking Becky into it's burning belly. \nMALE REPORTER #1 Turn around and let me see. \nEXT. GRAVEYARD - LATER \nAnnette, Amber (wearing her tiara) and Loretta are leaving the crowning ceremony.  All are happy as they push an extremely drugged Annette out of the cemetery. \nLORETTA What is wrong with you? \nAMBER I don't know.

LORETTA'S TRAILER - DAY \nAmber sits on the picnic table.  In the b.g., Loretta exits her trailer with a FED-EX GUY.  She pats his buns as he exits.  She approaches Amber with a packet. \nAMBER (V.O.) I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that.  The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time. \nLORETTA (handing over packet) This came for you, sweetie. \nAMBER Ah!  It's from State!  Oh my God! \nAmber rips it open and holds up a color brochure with COLLEEN and TERRY in a glamour shot on the cover. \nAMBER (cont'd) (paging through packet) It's all the stuff I get to do.

In the b.g., a pageant worker passes out PINK BAGS to the contestants.  All the while, TWO FAT KIDS play \"Marco Polo\" in the pool. \nCOLLEEN (tipsy, holding up glass) I can sum up our entire philosophy with this glass.  I look at it and say, \"it's half full.\"  Which, in the beauty pageant biz means, \"Where the hell's my waiter!\" \nShe laughs hard, then spins around in her chair. \nCOLLEEN (cont'd) (screaming) Stop with the fuckin' Marco-Polo before I rip your fat little heads off! \nINT.

HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - MONTAGE \nON AMBER ATKINS \nwith a MAP OF THE U.S. HEADDRESS, dances up to the mic. \nAMBER Living in a country where no matter who you are or where you come from, you can grow up and become what you've always dreamed of, makes me, Amber Atkins, proud to be an American! \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - MONTAGE \nON MOLLY HOWARD \nwearing an Atomic Blast at Hiroshima Headdress. \nMOLLY Atomic power makes me, Molly Howard, proud to be an Asian-American. \nAs she steps away from the mic, Tess Weinhaus, wearing a huge ball of twine headdress, dances up to the mic. \nTESS Uh, this, uh, my Uncle Phil's World's Largest Ball of Twine, in Bundy Minnesota, makes me, um, it makes me proud I'm American - I kinda misunderstood the assignment. \nThe ball of twine falls to the floor and rolls off the stage, still attached at one end to her head. \nBACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOM \nPandemonium!  Contestants change into their \"Physical Fitness\" outfits.  (T-shirts with red flags, shorts) Civil Servettes try to help.  A LARGE PICTURE of Janelle Betz sits at her counter space. \nIRIS Okay, okay!  Listen-up.  Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal. (off clipboard) Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the \"Physical Fitness\" routine... \nAMBER Oh my God!  My-my tap costume's gone. \nCommotion stops.  Becky continues to get ready. \nIRIS Uh, Amber?  We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your \"Physical Fitness\" outfit.  And let's shake a leg, ladies. \nAMBER No, wait.  It-it was here before the openin' number...wait.  What am I sayin'?  I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it? \nBecky freezes, staring daggers at Amber. \nBECKY What? \n", "test2_id": 1663, "test3_input": "BECKY (talking over music) I don't know how many of you know this, but I've got a very special fella in my life - that's right, I do... And if nobody minds, I'd like to sing a little song, just for him. \nSPOT FOLLOWS as Becky stands and walks center stage to what appears to be a COVERED MANNEQUIN.  TAPED INTRO TO \"I Can't Take My Eyes Off You.\" \nBECKY (cont'd) You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off of you.  You'd be like Heaven to touch.  I wanna hold you so much.  At long last love has arrived and I thank God I'm alive. \nBecky removes the sheet, revealing a MANNEQUIN dressed like JESUS as he appeared on the cross: long hair, beard, crown of thorns, loincloth.  The ARMS ARE STUFFED so they move freely.  (Hands of stigmata.) \nBECKY (cont'd) You're just to good to be true.  Can't take my eyes off of you... \nBecky TALK-SINGS - a la William Shatner's \"Rocket Man\" - and DANCES around the Jesus mannequin doing the jitter- bug, the twist and a slow dance (his arms on her shoulders). \nDURING THE SLOW DANCE, THE LOIN CLOTH SLIPS AND BECKY MUST HOLD IT UP - GIVING THE APPEARANCE OF GRABBING HIS CROTCH. \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - BACKSTAGE \nIris approaches Lisa who's given her outfit to Amber. \nIRIS C'mon, Lisa.  You're up next. \nLISA I quit.  And, uh, since my costume, y'know, was okay'd a month ago?  I'm givin' it to Amber. \nAmber breaks a smile. \nTaped music ENDS.  APPLAUSE.  Gladys, mic in hand, joins Becky for a big hug. \nGLADYS Boy, I'd hate to follow that.  Wow! \nBecky exits, pulling the wheeled Jesus behind her. \nGLADYS (cont'd) Voice of an angel, that one. \nIris runs self-consciously out on stage, whispers in Gladys' ear, then runs back off stage. \nGLADYS (cont'd) ...Uh, I was just told that contestant number seven, Lisa Swenson, has quite the pageant. \nCROWD REACTS. \nGLADYS (cont'd) Well, these things happen.  At any rate, we still have one more contestant - number eight, Amber Atkins. \nGladys exits.  A taped hip, hot DRUM BEAT starts. Suddenly, Amber glides into CENTER SPOT.  (Now wearing Lisa's costume, sleeves rolled up.)  Her feet burst into an amazing routine.  The loud drum beats seem to fly from her hands and feet as they punctuate the rhythm.  There's no glitz, just unbelievable skill.  It appears effortless as she floats around stage.  Like watching Michael Jackson moon walk for the first time, you can't take your eyes off her.  She concludes, center stage, with the GREATEST THIRTY SECONDS OF HER LIFE.  The audience goes WILD!  Amber takes bow after bow - they love her.  Gladys enters quickly, mic in hand. \nGLADYS (cont'd) Okay, okay, okay!  Well, now, it's finally time to say good-bye to our judges, so they can go make the toughest decision of their lives. \nPAN TO JUDGES.  They look nervous as hell.  A relaxed Hank sniffs from a paint soaked bag. \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASS ROOM - NIGHT \nJudges stare nervously at the camera - clip boards in front of them.  Hank's LOUD BREATHING from the paint soaked bag is obviously getting on John's nerves. \nDOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.) So who get's the crown?  How are you going to figure this all out? \nJOHN Uh, we're gonna, y'know, compare scores and uh, figure out a-a winner. kCause we don't know the winner yet... I mean, I-I don't know who Jean and Harold picked.  No idea.  Did Gladys send you in here? \nHANK I know the winner!  I know the winner! I know the winner! \nJOHN No you don't!  Shut your goddamn mouth, you son-of-a-bitch!! \nNerves shot, John suddenly LAUNCHES himself across the table at Hank. \nHAROLD Wait a second. \nJOHN You shut it!  You goddamn retard! \nHank freezes, then starts to wail! \nHANK EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE! \nHAROLD Come on!  Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat! \nHank stops crying and goes back to the bag. \n", "test3_true": "Hank begins crying again. \nHAROLD Real nice.  You know the sitter's dead. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nBACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOM \nGirls, in gowns, sit in silence.  Becky and Amber sit at opposite ends of the room.  There's obvious tension. \nLESLIE So, anyone talk to Janelle? \nAMBER Yah-I brought her some flowers this morning.  She's in the room next to my mom.  She's super happy. \nGirls ad-lib SHOCK. \nTESS She's happy? \nLESLIE Why happy? \nAMBER (cont'd) Oh -- the blow to her head made her deaf... \nGirls ad-lib \"Oh, I see.  Okay-then.\" etc.  Another LONG BEAT of SILENCE follows.  Becky gets up to re-touch her make-up. \nBECKY (losing it) Oh, good Lord!  What're they doin'? Lettin' the retard count votes?! \nContestants stare at her in shock.  Iris enters. \nIRIS It's time, ladies. \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM \nJudges are back.  Gladys is center stage.  Girls enter and form a line behind her.  TAPED AMERICAN MEDLEY STARTS. \nGLADYS Welcome back, everyone.  Judges.  Our Second Runner-up and winner of a fifty- Taped fanfare.

Contestants (except Becky) take hands. Iris gives Gladys an envelope and trophy. \nGLADYS (cont'd) And the First Runner-up is - (opening envelope, face drops) Contestant number eight, Amber Atkins. \nAd-lib audience shock and disbelief.  Contestants are stunned.  Amber steps forward, humbly takes the trophy and stands beside Leslie.  Audience finally quiets. \nGLADYS (cont'd) And finally, the moment I know I've been waiting for... \nIris hands Gladys a LARGE TROPHY and envelope.  Mary Johanson is wheeled out wearing sash and tiara. \nGLADYS (cont'd) With a scholarship of five-hundred dollars, courtesy Leeman Furniture, and all expenses paid for next weekend when she'll be competin' for the title of Minnesota American Teen Princess... \nTaped drum roll.

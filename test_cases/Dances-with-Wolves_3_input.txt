DANCES WITH WOLVES What ever is on your mind. 
STANDS WITH A FIST We have decided. You are my husband. I am your wife. That is all I know. 
Dances With Wolves lays his forehead on her back. He sighs. Then he pulls away, slips a robe around his shoulders and walks out of the lodge. 
Sadly, she watches him go. 
EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY 
We follow a pair of boots walking in the snow. Pan up to find an ORDERLY bringing coffee to a MAJOR. He is surrounded by other officers and in front of him a large column of men is moving toward the snow covered mountains. 
The Major tosses the remaining coffee in a fire and he prepares to mount. 
We pan up with the smoke and the steam. 
EXT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAY 
It's cold in the Sioux camp. A warm column of smoke is spiraling out of Ten Bears' lodge. 
INT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAY 
Several men are gathered around Ten Bears' fire, including Kicking Bird, Wind In His Hair and Dances With Wolves. 
All the men are draped with blankets. The wind is howling outside. The men are engaged in small talk as the pipe goes around the circle. 
The pipe comes around to Dances With Wolves, and the man next to him must nudge him to attention. Dances With Wolves takes the pipe and begins to smoke. 
Ten Bears watches him closely. 
TEN BEARS (to Dances With Wolves) Dances With Wolves is quiet these days. 
He does not reply. He smokes a little more and passes the pipe. 
TEN BEARS Is his heart bad? 
Dances With Wolves glances at the men around the fire. 
DANCES WITH WOLVES Killing the soldiers at the river was a good thing. It made me free and my heart was big to see my friends coming to help me. I did not mind killing those men. I was glad to do it. 
He searches for the right words. 
DANCES WITH WOLVES But the soldiers hate me now like they hate no other. I am more than an enemy to them, I am a traitor. They will hunt for me. They will not give up. And when they find me they find you and that cannot happen. 
Objections break out all around the fire. Wind In His Hair jumps to his feet and even Kicking Bird is protesting. 
TEN BEARS Quiet!... sit down Wind In His Hair. You are hurting an old man's ears with your loud talk. 
EXT. FOREST - DAY 
The column of soldiers can be heard but not seen. They are moving forward, singing the Battle Hymn of The Republic. 
INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DUSK 
Stands With A Fist is building up the fire in their cozy home. Dances With Wolves works on a long-stemmed pipe which is in the last stages of completion. 
TEN BEARS (O.S.) Dances With Wolves? 
Dances With Wolves gets up, opens the flap and admits the old chief. A few snowflakes cling to his wispy hair. 
He goes straight to the fire and sits. 
TEN BEARS Ahh... this is a nice fire... at my age a good fire is better than anything. 
Stands With A Fist brings two small bowls of food, places them next to the men and busies herself with something else. Though neither one is much interested they begin to eat. 
TEN BEARS I wondered how your bad heart was doing and though I would come by and see for myself. This place doesn't look so bad-hearted. 
Dances With Wolves smiles. 
DANCES WITH WOLVES No, we are happy. 
TEN BEARS But you are leaving anyway? 
DANCES WITH WOLVES I have talked with Stands With a Fist and we will go together. 
TEN BEARS Have you told this to Kicking Bird or to Wind In His Hair. 
It's anguish for Dances with Wolves to think about his friends. He shakes his head "no". Ten Bears thinks again in silence. 
TEN BEARS You are the only white man I have ever known. I have thought about you alot. More than you know. 
DANCES WITH WOLVES That does not surprise me. 
TEN BEARS You have always spoken with your heart. And like all of us, you are a free man and can do anything you like. When I look across this fire, I do not see a white soldier. I see only a Sioux named Dances With Wolves. And there is nothing they hate so much as a Sioux. 
Ten Bears words always have purpose and as always, he makes his point. 
He pauses for a moment and notices Dances with Wolves' nearly finished pipe. 
TEN BEARS You are making a pipe? 
DANCES WITH WOLVES Yes? 
Ten Bears holds out a hand and Dances with Wolves hands the pipe to him. Ten Bears inspects it briefly. 
TEN BEARS This might be a pretty good pipe... how does it smoke? 
DANCES WITH WOLVES I don't know, I haven't tried it yet. 
TEN BEARS Let's smoke it awhile... it is good to pass the time this way. 
EXT. WINTER CAMP - DAWN 
From a little distance, Wind In His Hair is watching Dances With Wolves' lodge. His face is full of uncertainty and a kind of pain we have never seen before. He is in agony.

{"test1_input": "An impression of a knife slashing, as if tearing at the very screen, ripping the film. Over it the brief gulps of screaming. And then silence. And then the dreadful thump as Mary's body falls in the tub. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nThe blank whiteness, the blur of the shower water, the hand pulling the shower curtain back. We catch one flicker of a glimpse of the murderer. A woman, her face contorted with madness, her head wild with hair, as if she were wearing a fright-wig.  And then we see only the curtain, closed across the tub, and hear the rush of the shower water. Above the shower-bar we see the bathroom door open again and after a moment we HEAR the SOUND of the front door slamming. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DEAD BODY \nLying half in, half out of the tub, the head tumbled over, touching the floor, the hair wet, one eye wide open as if popped, one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor. Coming down the side of the tub, running thick and dark along the porcelain, we see many small threads of blood. CAMERA FOLLOWS away from the body, travels slowly across the bathroom, past the toilet, out into the bedroom. As CAMERA approaches the bed, we see the folded newspaper as Mary placed it on the bedside table. \nCLOSE UP - THE NEWSPAPER \nbeside the bed. The CAMERA now moves away over to the window and looks up to the house, and as it gets there we HEAR, coming from within the house, the SOUND of Norman's fearful, shocked voice. \nNORMAN'S VOICE Mother! Oh God, what... blood, blood... mother...! \nWe cannot entirely distinguish these exclamations. \nAfter a moment or two of silence, Norman emerges from the front door, dashes down the path toward the motel. \nQUICK CUT TO: \nEXT. THE PATH - (NIGHT) \nNorman is coming AT CAMERA, running head-on. He dashes into an extreme close up and we see the terror and fear ripe in his face. CAMERA PANS as Norman races past, holds as Norman runs to the porch and quickly along it and directly to Mary's room. \nINT. MARY'S CABIN - (NIGHT) \nNorman pauses a moment in the doorway, glances about the room, hears the shower going, sees the bathroom door is open. He goes to the bathroom, looks in, sees the body. \nSlowly, almost carefully, he raises his hands to his face, covers his eyes, turns his face away. Then he crosses to the window, looks out at the house. Shot is so angled that we see the bedside table with the newspaper on it. \nAfter a moment, Norman moves from the window, sinks onto the edge of the bed. \nFRESH ANGLE - BEHIND NORMAN \nNorman sitting on bed, the bathroom in b.g. of shot. We can see only the hand of the dead girl, lying along the tile floor. Norman presses his eyes, fights to find a way out of his dilemma. Slowly, a kind of settling comes upon him, the peace that comes with decision. \nNorman rises, goes to the window, looks out, and then, with resolution, closes the window and draws the curtain across it. Then he crosses to the front window, facing the porch, and draws those curtains closed. Then he switches off the bedroom light, leaving the room lit only by the spill from the bathroom. He opens the front door, goes out. \nEXT. THE HOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT) \nNorman comes out of Mary's cabin, closes the door carefully behind him, goes along the porch to his office, goes in. We stay outside. Immediately, the \"Vacancy\" sign goes off, and then the motel sign goes off. As CAMERA GOES closer to the office, the lights within go off and we HEAR a closet door opening and then the SOUND of a pail being picked up. Norman comes out of office, closes door, looks cautiously about, goes along porch, carrying pail with mop in it, goes into Mary's cabin, closing the door after him. \nINT. MARY'S CABIN \nWith the paper in the foreground, Norman enters. We can see him in the dim spill of light. He pauses by the door, then gathers his strength and goes into the bathroom. We HEAR him set the pail on the tiled floor, and then we HEAR the shower being turned off. And there is total silence. CAMERA MOVES FORWARD so that we can see into bathroom. \nCAMERA is ANGLED that we see Norman only from the waist up. Quickly and deftly he unhooks the shower curtain, emerges with it into the bedroom. CAMERA PANS down and we see him spread the shower curtain on the bedroom floor, just outside the bathroom door. He spreads the curtain so that one end of it comes up against the bathroom threshold and slightly over and onto the tile floor. Again he goes into the bathroom and CAMERA TILTS up so that we see only the upper half of Norman. He works carefully, with his arms extended away from his body, slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub, drags it across the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain in the bedroom. Having arranged the body, he straightens up, examines his hands, sees bloodstains on them. He returns to the bathroom, goes to the hand-basin. \nCLOSE SHOT \nWe see his hands being washed, see the bloodstains being diluted and washed away by the gush of the faucet water. \nNORMAN \nWe see Norman shake his hands free of the water, then turn to the job of cleaning the bathroom. \nHe places the pail in the tub, runs water into it, dips the mop in, swabs the tile floor. With a towel he wipes off the wall over the tub and the edges and sides of the tub and even the shower curtain rod. Then he takes a second towel and goes over the cleaned areas, carefully drying them. Finally he rinses and squeezes out the mop, empties the pail, cleans out the tub, and goes out into the bedroom. \nINT. MARY'S BEDROOM \nNorman steps carefully around the unseen body, crosses to the desk, starts going through Mary's handbag, in search of her car keys. He suddenly notices them lying on the desk, where he'd thrown them after parking her car. He picks up the keys, crosses the room, goes out. \nEXT. THE PORCH \nWe see Norman pauses at the door, check cautiously, then hurry across the porch and into Mary's car. He circle-turns the car, so that its trunk is backed up to the turns porch, directly opposite Mary's door, as close as it can go. \nThen he alights, goes to the trunk, opens it with the key and, leaving the trunk lid raised, goes back into the cabin. \nINT. MARY'S ROOM \nFrom a raised angle, we see Norman bend down and begin to wrap the shower curtain around the body. We see the edges of the curtain as they are raised and laid down again. Then he picks up the wrapped body, crosses to the door, uses his foot to pull the door open, and, leaving the door open behind him, goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body in the trunk. He closes the lid then, but does not lock it. He comes back into the cabin, closes the door completely, flicks on the light. \n", "test1_true": "With his free hand he picks up the pail, in which are the mop and the used towels. He crosses to the door, switches off the light with his shoulder, pulls open the door, starts out. \nEXT. THE PORCH \nAs Norman stands in the doorway, he is suddenly and blindingly lit by the bright headlights of a passing car. The flash of the lights and the SOUND of the SPEEDING CAR are over in a flicker of a moment, but it takes a few seconds for Norman to regain his former tense composure. Then he goes to the car trunk, raises it with his foot, throws the suitcase and the pail into it, slams it shut. He pauses a moment, then realizes he has left the bathroom light on in Mary's cabin. He returns to cabin. As he enters, his eye is caught by the newspaper on the bedside table. He goes to it, takes the newspaper, and looks once again into the bathroom. His glance goes right over the toilet bowl. \nHe turns out the lights, crosses the darkened cabin, goes out onto the porch. \nHe reopens the trunk, tosses in the newspaper and closes it. He goes around and jumps into the car and starts away. \nWe HOLD on the trunk, follow it for a while, then \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. THE SWAMP - (NIGHT) \nThe car pulls away from a CLOSE ANGLE on the trunk and as CAMERA HOLDS we see that we are now in a swamp area. \nIt is quiet except for the irritating noises of night insects. Norman stops the car at the very edge of the swamp, turns off the lights, gets out, leaving door open. He looks at the swamp, seems doubtful of its ability to swallow up the car, realizes he has no choice. He leans into the car, releases the emergency brake, starts to push. The front of the car begins to roll into the swamp. Suddenly there is the LOW, THROBBING SOUND of a motor. Norman freezes, listens. \nThe SOUND grows louder and Norman realizes it is an airplane flying overhead. The car is rolling quickly now. Norman jumps away, slams the door shut, stands tense. The SOUND of the plane overhead grows louder. \nNorman looks up. \nNORMAN'S VIEWPOINT - THE BLACK SKY \nWe see no plane. The SOUND of the motor is beginning to diminish. \nCUT BACK TO: \nNORMAN \nWe see the relief in his face. He looks at the car. \nMore than two-thirds of it have already sunk into the swamp. The trunk alone seems to hold poised above the sand and slime, as if refusing to go the rest of the way. Norman begins to panic, he steps dangerously close, pushes with his foot. And slowly the car sinks, until finally it is gone and we hear only the gentle plop of the swamp's final gulp, and see only the small after-bubble, like a visual burp. \nNorman waits a moment, then begins stamping out the tire marks, so obvious in the wet ground around the swamp. \nHe stamps and drags his feet over the markings as we: \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSE UP NORMAN \nstanding on the porch of the motel, leaning against a post. He is staring out into the night, a look of guarded, casual innocence on his face, as if he were taking one last moment of peaceful night air before retiring. Then he glances down and CAMERA follows his gaze. A hose is lying on the ground outside Mary's cabin, its stream of water obliterating the tire marks. \nAfter a moment, Norman's hand comes into shot, picks up hose, places it in a new position. As CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see that the water from the hose has erased and rearranged the road markings so that it would be impossible to tell that a car had been parked here. \nAfter a short wait, Norman goes to the hose-faucet, turns it off, unscrews the hose. As he rolls the hose, he walks away from the spot, past the office, heading for the path that leads to the house. He goes up the path, pauses at the steps of the house, tosses the curled hose onto the lawn, goes up the steps and into the house. CAMERA FOLLOWS him in, PAUSES as he pauses at the foot of the stairs. Norman goes up the stairs. \nOn the landing he stops. The door to his mother's room is closed. Lying in a heap outside the door are a blood-stained dress and a pair of elderly-woman's shoes. From an EXTREMELY HIGH ANGLE, we look down on Norman as he bends to pick up the stained dress and shoes. \nHe rolls the shoes into the dress, tucks the small, neat bundle under his arm, and starts down the stairs, heading for the basement. \nEXT. A LONG SHOT OF THE OLD HOUSE - (NIGHT) \nIt stands silhouetted against the sky. There is a long wait. Then, slowly, a curl of smoke comes out of the chimney. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN \nINT. BACK ROOM OF SAM'S HARDWARE STORE IN FAIRVALE - (DAY) \nSam is seated at his desk, writing a letter. Sequence \nbegins with CAMERA IN CLOSE, over Sam's shoulder, and we can read as mush as he has written of the letter. The letterhead reads \"Sam Loomis - Hardware,\" and the letter reads: \"Dearest right-as-always Mary: I'm sitting in this tiny back room which isn't big enough for both of us, and suddenly it looks big enough for both of us. So what if we're poor and cramped and miserable, at least we'll be happy! If you haven't come to your senses, and still want to... \nCAMERA begins PULLING AWAY as Sam turns the sheet of paper over, continues backing away out of the small back room and heads, backwards, down the corridor, we see a young clerk, BOB SUMMERFIELD, Sam's assistant, standing behind the counter, a look of handsome patience on his face. He is waiting on a meticulous, elderly woman customer, who is holding and examining a large can of insecticide. As CAMERA PASSES: \nWOMAN CUSTOMER ...They tell you what its ingredients are and how it's guaranteed to exterminate any insect in the world, but they do not tell you whether or not it's painless. And I say insect or man, death should always be painless. \nCAMERA, by this has reached the front door of the hardware store and we now see a girl standing just inside the door. She is an attractive girl with a rather definite manner, a look of purposefulness. She carries a handbag and a small overnight case. She is Mary's sister, LILA CRANE. \nBob Summerfield has noticed Lila, smiles brightly at her, gives her an I'll-be-with-you-in-a-moment nod. \n", "test1_id": 984, "test2_input": "SAM We were going to get married. Are going to get married! \nLILA Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam. \nSAM This is the old highway. \nLILA I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper. \nSAM Watch your tenses. \nLILA Huh? \nSAM She always tries to be proper. \nSam slows the truck to a stop, sighs, starts to light up a cigarette. Lila looks questioningly and impatiently at him. \nLILA You going to wait here for me? \nSAM I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in... \nLILA We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside. \nSAM You won't believe it... (Starts motor) But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers! \nLILA (A tiny smile, first in hours) I believe it. \nAs truck starts to drive on, \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE BATES MOTEL AND HOUSE - (DAY) \nThe place is empty and silent and washed dirty by the deep gray of the cloudy sky. We see Sam's truck turning into the driveway and pulling to a stop. After a moment, Sam and Lila get out of the truck. \nFRESH ANGLE \nClose on Sam and Lila as they meet on the porch side of the truck. The motel office and the house beyond can be seen in b.g. of shot. Sam and Lila merely stare for a moment, then turn and gaze up at the house. There is no figure in the window and the shade is drawn. Same goes to the office door, peers in, knocks, opens door, enters. Lila remains on the driveway, beside the truck. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE MOTHER'S ROOM - (DAY) \nCLOSE ANGLE on Norman standing by the window. He has pulled the curtains very slightly apart, is staring out and down at the motel, his eyes studying the lone figure of Lila, who is standing by the truck and looking up at the house.  Norman studies her, and as her eyes look up at this very window he closes the curtains, turns away. \nWe see the suspicion and fear in his face, the surge of panic and his struggle to contain it. Then he goes away. CAMERA remains on window, shooting out and down, and through the frail curtains we can see Sam as he comes out of the motel office and joins Lila. \nEXT. MOTEL OFFICE - CLOSE ON SAM AND LILA \nSAM (Unconsciously whispering) I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting? \nLILA Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move. \nSam takes Lila's arm. \nSAM Come on. \nHe starts with her toward the path which leads to the old house. CAMERA PANS with them, and as they turn around the office corner, they see Norman coming down the path toward them. They pause and Norman pauses. He does not smile, nor speak. His usual grin and soft friendliness are gone; containment and impassivity lie in their place. \nSAM (Cheerfully) Just coming up to ring for you. \nNORMAN (Coming forward) I suppose you want a cabin. \nSAM We'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it. \nNorman walks past Sam, giving him the sort of quick, disapproving glance one gives a man who is obviously lying, goes onto the porch and into the office. Sam and Lila follow Norman. \nINT. MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY) \nNorman crosses to the desk, goes behind it, takes the key to cabin number twelve off the keyboard. Sam and Lila have entered and are almost to the desk-counter by this time. \nNORMAN I'll take you to... \nSAM Better sign in first, hasn't we? \nSam eyes scan the counter, looking for a registration book. \n", "test2_true": "SAM (Interrupting with a friendly cheerfulness) Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt. \nNorman stares at Sam, as if he'd like to yell at him, call him \"liar.\" Instead he reaches under the desk counter, brings out the registration book. Lila moves closer, studies the book as Sam signs in. Sam signs \"Joe and Mrs. Johnson.\"  The signature and city of \"Marie Samuels\" and after it, the notation \"Cabin One,\" can be clearly seen three registrations above Sam's. \nWhen Sam has finished he closes book, hands it back to Norman. Norman does not take it, starts out from behind counter. \nNORMAN I'll get your bags. \nSAM Haven't any. \nNORMAN (after a stare) I'll show you the cabin. \nAs he starts for the door, Sam laughs. Norman stops, turns, looks at him. \nSAM First time I've seen it happen. (to Lila) Check in any place in this country without bags, and you have to pay in advance. \nSam smiles as if at a funny remark, takes a bill out of his pocket. \nNORMAN Ten dollars... \nNorman returns to Sam, takes the extended bill, is about to start out again. \nSAM That receipt...? \nNorman goes reluctantly behind counter, lays down the key to cabin twelve, takes a receipt book out of the drawer under counter, starts to write. Lila steps up to the desk, picks up the key, quickly, starts out. \nLILA I'll start ahead. \nNorman looks up, gazes her as she goes out door. \nEXT. THE MOTEL - (DAY) \nLila comes along the porch, pauses before cabin one, tries the door. It opens. She closes it quickly as she hears Sam and Norman coming out of the motel office, continues on down the porch. \nSAM (To Norman, who is following) Don't bother yourself... we'll find it. \nHe goes on down the porch, doesn't even glance at cabin one, walks quickly and catches up to Lila just as she reaches cabin twelve. CAMERA REMAINS with Norman, who is standing by the office door, looking after Sam and Lila, his face alert and no longer impassive. He waits a moment, after they have closed their cabin door, then crosses to the pickup truck. CAMERA MOVES with him. He studies the truck, then leans in through the driver's window, twists the registration card around, reads it. \nIt gives the correct name and address of Sam Loomis. \nNorman comes back out of the window, glances once more toward cabin twelve, then at the old house. His suspicions are confirmed, and now there is the relaxation of relief in his face. He takes on a purposeful air, turns, strides up the path, up onto the porch of the house, opens the door, goes in. \nINT. CABIN TWELVE - (DAY) \nLila is at the cabin's rear window, looking out, straining for a glimpse of the old house, which cannot be seen from the window of this cabin. \nShe turns, frustrated, anxious. Sam is standing at the foot of the bed, staring at the smooth coverlet, his brow creased in a sadness. \nLILA We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in. \nSAM I'm glad we didn't. \nHe pulls his eyes from the bed, crosses to the desk, sits wearily, lights a cigarette. Lila watches him for a moment, feels a real compassion, goes to the bed, sits on its edge, turns again and looks at Sam's back. \nLILA We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt. \nSAM I know. (A pause) Do you think if something happened, it happened there? \nLILA (A pause, then:) Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else? (As Sam studies her) Forty thousand dollars? \nSAM How could we prove... (An almost hopeless laugh) Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now... \nLILA There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way! \nSAM What makes you sound so certain? \nLILA Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us.  Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something! \nSam considers a moment, nods agreement, rises. \nSAM We'll start with Cabin One. \nHe goes to the door, opens it slightly, looks out, then, back to Lila: \nSAM If he sees us... we're just taking the air. \n", "test2_id": 985, "test3_input": "Lila's hand pushes the door open. We see the hallway. \nLila ENTERS PAST CAMERA. \nINT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY OF OLD HOUSE - (DAY) \nLila closes the door, remains by it for a moment, quiet, listening. Her eyes scan the layout, the closed door which leads off the hallway, to the dining room on the right and the parlor on the left. Down at the end of the hall is the kitchen, the door wide open, the room beyond dim and silent. She notices the stairs leading down to the basement, stares at them, then back to the stairs leading to the second floor. She starts forward, and seems about to investigate the parlor and dining room. \nINT. THE MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY) \nNorman is behind the counter, standing, staring at Sam who is sitting relaxedly on a small sofa. Norman has the look of one who is protecting himself, as if the counter were a protective wall against the threatening world across it. \nSAM (Cheerfully, as if after a self-conscious pause) I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I? \nNORMAN Yes. \nSAM I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening! (A pause) You are alone here, aren't you? (As Norman does not reply) It would drive me crazy. \nNORMAN That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it? \nSAM (Lightly) Just an expression... (More seriously) What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you? \nINT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY AND STAIRS OF OLD HOUSE - (DAY) \nLila is halfway up the stairs. As she climbs she is startled by the creaks and groans of the old wood of the steps. She steps more carefully. CAMERA remains at foot of stair, TILTING UP as Lila climbs. She pauses at the head of the stair. The door on her right, which opens into the mother's room, is closed. To her left is another door, half-open. Directly before her is a third door, closed. She holds a long moment, trying to picture in her mind which room would look out on the front of the house, decides, chooses the correct door, the one on her right. She goes to it, knocks lightly. \nINT. THE MOTHER'S ROOM (DAY) - CLOSE ANGLE ON DOOR \nWe hear Lila's second knock, then, faintly, her soft call. \nLILA'S VOICE (O.S.) Mrs. Bates? \nThere is quiet for a moment, then the door begins to open, and we see Lila. She stands on the threshold, looking in at the room, instantly disturbed by it, almost chilled, her expression indicating an impulse to close the door and go away from this room forever. \nAfter a moment, she enters, leaving the door open behind her. CAMERA PULLS BACK AND AWAY and we now see the room as Lila sees it. \nIt is ornate, damask-and-mahogany, thick and warm and ripe, an olla podrida of mismated furnishings and bric-a-brac of the last century. The bed is four poster, but uncanoped; the dressing table is fancy and flounced with satin; there is a great chiffonier, a big-doored wardrobe, a large, oval, full- length pier-glass (this against the wall directly opposite the door), a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair by the window, a white marble fireplace, its grate cold but piled with ashes. \nAnd there is in the room an unmistakably live quality, as if even though it is presently unoccupied, it has not been long vacated by some musty presence. \nLila glances at the bed. The damask coverlet is thrown over it, but it is not neat, there is the imprint of a body on it, a body which obviously has slept in a curled-up, womb- like position. Lila stares at it for a moment, up, then goes to the dressing table. Its top is scattered with boxes and jars of cosmetics and creams, traces of fresh powder, an opened bottle or perfume, a comb, and a brush with traces of hair in its bristles. Lila moves on, catches a glimpse of herself in the pier-glass, is startled, turns away, goes to the chiffonier, is about to open a drawer, sees the high wardrobe out of the corner of her eyes, goes to it, hesitantly. She opens one door. Fresh, clean, well pressed dresses hang neatly. Lila opens the other door. The sweaters and dresses and robes hang freely, none in moth-proof, storage- type bags. There is even a well-brushed collar of foxes. Along the floor of the wardrobe is a line of clean, polished shoes. Lila stares, then closes the door, turns, looks once again over the whole room, starts out, \nINT. THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY) \nLila comes out of the mother's room, closes the door behind her, looks down the stairs, then starts across the hall to the room whose door is half-open. The room within is dark, the shades drawn full. \nLila pauses on the threshold, reaches in, feels the wall, throws on a switch. \nINT. MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY) \nSam has risen, is standing by the counter now. \nSAM I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place... \nNORMAN (Angrily) This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy. \nSAM And now that your mother's dead? \nNorman snaps a sharp, fast, ugly look at him. \nNORMAN My mother is not dead! \nSAM (Softly) I didn't think so. \nINT. NORMAN'S ROOM IN THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY) \nLila is standing in the doorway, staring at the room in sick dismay. The room is grotesque, a horrible, ludicrous fantasy of childhood held beyond the point of decency. \nIt is a small room. The walls are fancied with romping silhouettes of teddy-bears and sailboats and carousels and fat cows jumping over aghast moons. The bed is small, far too short for a man of Norman's height. And yet the rumpled covers indicate that it is in this bed that Norman sleeps. Next to the bed is an old-fashioned toy chest. On its top there are a bird-in-a-cage lamp, a plain-bound book, and an ash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs. A grown man's shirt hangs on a child's clothes tree. \nAgainst one wall there is a narrow, high bookcase filled with thick, unchildish-looking books. On the small, white chest of drawers there is an old, child's victrola. The record on the turntable is discovered, on close inspection, to be Beethoven's Eroica Symphony. \nLila studies the room, fascinated and repelled. She glances at the bookcase, comes into the room, goes to the bookcase and pulls out a thick, large, plain-bound book. She opens it. Her eyes go wide in shock. And then there is disgust. She slams the book closed, drops it. \nINT. THE MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY) \n", "test3_true": "Norman's face is no longer expressionless. It has the stark, high sheen of a cornered animal. \nSAM (Pressing) You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening? \nNORMAN I don't know what you've been saying. \nSAM I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it? \nNORMAN Do what? \nSAM Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother! \nNORMAN Shut up! \nSAM Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it... \nNORMAN Leave me alone! \nSAM ...Forty thousand dollars! \nNORMAN Leave me alone! \nHe is close to panic now. He turns, swiftly, dashes back into his private parlor. Sam goes quickly around the counter, follows. \nINT. NORMAN'S PRIVATE PARLOR - (DAY) \nNorman hears Sam following, wants to run, to never be reached by this man. He crosses the small room, drawn to the rear window, as if he might fly through it. Sam enters, pauses. Norman turns, back against the window, as unable to fly away as are the many still, stuffed birds. Sam registers a brief flicker of reaction when he sees the birds, but continues to gaze at Norman, hard. \nSAM I bet your mother knows where the money is. And what you did to get it. And I think she'll tell us. \nSomething self-assured and confident in Sam's tone gives Norman a new, more terrified alarm. He turns his head, glances out the window at the old house. He looks back at Sam and there is terror in his voice. \nNORMAN Where's that girl? The girl you came with! Where is she? \nSam does not respond, smiles a half-smile, turns to examine a stuffed owl. Norman looks back at the house. \nNORMAN (A horrible groan) Oh, God! \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALL OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY) \nLila, shaken and disturbed, almost sickened, is coming out of Norman's room. She has left the light on. She pauses in the middle of the landing, looks at the closed door opposite the stairs, goes to it, opens it, sees that it is the bathroom, pulls the door to, turns, starts toward the stairs. \nINT. NORMAN'S PRIVATE PARLOR - (DAY) \nSam is lying on the floor, face downward, unmoving. A candlestick is on the floor, close by his head, still rocking as if just dropped. OVER SHOT comes the SOUND of Norman's footsteps and CAMERA TURNS in time to catch a brief glimpse of him going out into the office, almost at a run. \nINT. STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY) \nLila is on the top step, looking down toward CAMERA. \nShe is listening, hoping to hear some human sound, some sound she might follow, pursue. She hears nothing. She starts down the stairs. Just below the halfway step, she looks at the front door, sees out through the door window: \nLILA'S VIEWPOINT - (DAY) \nNorman coming. \nINT. STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY) \nFor a moment Lila panics, then she hurries down the steps, cannot go in the direction of the front door, remembers the stairway behind her, turns and runs in that direction. The SOUND of Norman bounding up the porch steps can be heard. Lila turns and dashes down the stairs which lead to the basement, going down far enough to conceal herself, crouching there. \nNorman enters the hallway, closes the door softly, listens. He glances once in the direction of the basement stairs. He seems about to smile, when suddenly all expression vanishes from his face, and he appears to enter a no-place, no-time state. He crosses to the stairway, goes up. \nLila remains crouched on the basement stairs, listening to the SOUNDS of Norman.

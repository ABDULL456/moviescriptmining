{"train": "\"PSYCHO\" \n\"PSYCHO\" \nBy \nJoseph Stefano \nBased on the novel by Robert Bloch \nREVISED December 1, 1959 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. PHOENIX, ARIZONA - (DAY) - HELICOPTER SHOT \nAbove Midtown section of the city. It is early afternoon, a hot mid-summer day. The city is sun-sunblanched white and its drifted-up noises are muted in blanched their own echoes. We fly low, heading in a downtown direction, passing over traffic-clogged streets, parking lots, white business buildings, neatly patterned residential districts. As we approach downtown section, the character of the city begins to change. It is darker and shabby with age and industry. We see railroad tracks, smokestacks, wholesale fruit-and- vegetable markets, old municipal buildings, empty lots. vegetable The very geography seems to give us a climate of nefariousness, of back-doorness, dark and shadowy. And secret. \nWe fly lower and faster now, as if seeking out a specific location. A skinny, high old hotel comes into view. On its exposed brick side great painted letters advertise \"Transients- Low Weekly Rates-Radio in Every Room.\" We pause long enough to establish the shoddy character of this hotel. Its open, curtainless windows, its silent resigned look so characteristic of such hole-and-corner hotels. We move forward with purposefulness and-toward a certain window. The sash is raised as high as it can go, but the shade is pulled down to three or four inches of the inside sill, as if the occupants of the room within wanted privacy but needed air. We are close now, so that only the lower half of the window frame is in shot. No sounds come from within the room. \nSuddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between shade and sill, peep into the room. \nA young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed. She wears a full slip, stockings, no shoes. She lies in and attitude of physical relaxation, but her face, seen in the dimness of the room, betrays a certain inner-tension, worrisome conflicts. She is MARY CRANE, an tension, attractive girl nearing the end of her twenties and her rope. \nA man stands beside the bed, only the lower half of his figure visible. We hold on this tableau for a long moment, then start forward. As we pass under the window shade, \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE HOTEL ROOM - (DAY) \nA small room, a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow bed. A card of hotel rules is pasted on the mirror above the bureau. An unopened suitcase and a woman's large, straw open- top handbag are on the bureau. \nOn the table beside the bed there are a container of Coco- Cola and an unwrapped, untouched egg-salad sandwich. There is no radio. \nThe man standing by the bed, wearing only trousers, T-shirt and sox, is SAM LOOMIS, a good-looking, sensual shirt man with warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile. He is blotting his neck and face with a thin towel, and is staring down at Mary, a small sweet smile playing about his mouth. Mary keeps her face turned away from him. \nAfter a moment, Sam drops the towel, sits on the bed, leans over and takes Mary into his arms, kisses her long and warmly, holds her with a firm possessiveness. The kiss is disturbed and finally interrupted by the buzzing closeness of an inconsiderate fly. Sam smiles, pulls away enough to allow Mary to relax again against the pillow. He studies her, frowns at her unresponsiveness, then speaks in a low, intimate, playful voice. \nSAM Never did eat your lunch, did you. \nMary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her, kisses him. Then, and without breaking the kiss, she swings her legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds her shoes, slips her feet into searches them. And finally pulls away and sits up. \nMARY I better get back to the office. These extended lunch hours give my boss excess acid. \nShe rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings out of her bag, begins putting them on, not bothering or perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror. Sam watches her, concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery, humorous good mood. Throughout remainder of this scene, they occupy themselves with dressing, hair-combing, etc. \nSAM Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot. \nMARY (soft sarcasm) What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport? \nSAM (meaningfully) We could laze around here a while longer. \nMARY Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up... (a small anguish) Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this. \nSAM I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it... \nMARY (interrupting) When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately. \nSAM You sure talk like a girl who's been married. \nMARY Sam! \nSAM I'm sorry, Mary. (after a moment) My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it. \nMARY I've lost my girlish laughter. \nSAM (observing) The only girlish thing you have lost. \nMARY (a meaningful quiet, then, with difficulty:) Sam. This is the last time. \nSAM For what? \nMARY This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come. \nSAM Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters? \nMary goes out quickly, closing door behind her. As Sam stares down at his shoeless feet, \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - (DAY) - HIGH ANGLE \nShooting down at hotel entrance. Mary comes out, walks quickly to a parked cab, gets in. The cab zooms up the awful street. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. LOWERY REAL ESTATE OFFICE - (DAY) \nA small, moderately successful office off the main street. A cab pulls up at the curb. We see Mary get out of cab, pay driver, cross pavement to the office door. \nINT. OUTER OFFICE - (DAY) \nMary enters office, crosses to her desk, sits down, rubs her temples, finally looks over at Caroline, a girl in the last of her teens. \nMARY Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch? \nCAROLINE (a high, bright, eager- to-talk voice laced to-with a vague Texan accent) He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late. (a pause, then, as Mary does not respond to the pointed thrust) You getting a headache? \nMARY It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting. \nCAROLINE You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but (cheerfully takes bottle of pills out of desk drawer) my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding. (laughs) Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers! \nShe rises, starts for Mary's desk, pills in hand. \nMARY Were there any calls? \nCAROLINE Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and... \nShe breaks off, distracted by the SOUND of the door opening. MR. LOWERY and his oil-lease client, TOM CASSIDY enter the office. Lowery is a pleasant, worried-faced man, big and a trifle pompous. Cassidy is very faced loud and has a lunch- hour load on. He is a gross man, exuding a kind of pitiful vulgarity. \nCASSIDY Wow! Hot as fresh milk! You girls should get your boss to air-condition you up. He can afford it today. \nLowery flashes an embarrassed smile at Mary, tries to lead Cassidy toward the private office. \nLOWERY Mary, will you get those copies of the deed ready for Mr. Cassidy. \nCassidy pauses beside Mary's desk, hooks a haunch onto the desktop, smiles a wet smile at Mary. \nCASSIDY Tomorrow's the day! My sweet little girl... (laughs as Mary looks up at him) Not you, my daughter!  A baby, and tomorrow she stands up there and gets her sweet self married away from me! (pulling out wallet) I want you to look at my baby. Eighteen years old... and she's never had an unhappy day in any one of those years! (flashes photo) \nMary glances, cannot bring herself to smile or make some remark, continues sorting out the deed copies, tries to ignore the man's hot-breath closeness. \nLOWERY Come on, Tom, my office is air- conditioned. \nCASSIDY (ignoring Lowery) You know what I do with unhappiness? I buy it off! You unhappy? \nMARY Not inordinately. (puts deed copy into Cassidy's too-close hand) \nCASSIDY I'm buying this house for my baby's wedding present. Forty thousand dollars, cash! Now that ain't buying happiness, that's buying off unhappiness! That penniless punk she's marryin'... (laughs) Probably a good kid... it's just that I hate him. (looks at deed) Yup! Forty thousand, says here... (to Lowery) Casharoonie! \nHe takes out of his inside pocket, two separate bundles of new $100 bills and throws them onto the desk, under Mary's nose. Caroline's eyes go wide at the sight of the glorious green bundles of bills, and she comes close to the desk. Cassidy leans terribly close to Mary, flicks through the bills, laughs wickedly. \nCASSIDY I never carry more than I can afford to lose! (closer to Mary) Count 'em! \nLOWERY (shocked, worried) Tom... cash transactions of this size! Most irregular... \nCASSIDY So what? It's my private money! (laughs, winks, elbows Lowery) And now it's yours. \nCAROLINE (staring at the money) I declare! \nCASSIDY (whispering) I don't! That's how I'm able to keep it! (laughs) \nLOWERY (hastily interrupting) Suppose we just put this in the safe and then Monday morning when you're feeling good... \nCASSIDY Speakin' of feeling good, where's that bottle you said you had in your desk... (laughs, as if having given away Lowery's secret) Oops! (to Mary, patting her arm) Usually I can keep my mouth shut! \nHe rises, reels toward Lowery's office, pauses, turns, speaks to Mary, meaningfully. \nCASSIDY Honest. I can keep any private transaction a secret... any pri.... (stopped by Mary's cold gaze) Lowery! I'm dyin' of thirstaroonie! \nLowery starts after him, pauses, turns to Mary. Cassidy has gone into Lower's office. \nMARY'S CAR - (DAY) \nMary watches the entire exchange with a look of stony horror on her face. \nEXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY) \nNow we look closely at Lowery. As he reaches the curb, a small confusion brightens his face. He remembers that Mary intended to \"spend the weekend in bed.\" He considers, curiously, turns, looks back at her, a slight frown on his face. \nMARY'S CAR - (DAY) \nMary sees the pause and the look. \nEXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY) \nFor a moment it even looks as if Lowery might be meaning to cross back to the car. \nMARY'S CAR - (DAY) \nMary's tension is unbearable. And at that moment we hear the shrill shriek of the traffic cop's whistle. \nMary zooms the car away. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. HIGHWAY - (DAY) \nMary in car, driving, safely away from town. Her look is less tense now, and more purposeful. After a moment, she checks the fuel gauge, frowns, looks along highway for a gas station. \nFAST DISSOLVE TO: \nMARY'S CAR - (DAY) \nApproaching and leaving city limits. \nMARY - (DAY) \nLooks at gas gauge. \nC.U. GAS GAUGE - (DAY) \nEXT. A GAS STATION - (DAY) \nWe see Mary's car drive in, come to a stop. There are no other cars about, this being a gas station off the main highway, and the attendant is obviously in the shack. Mary looks worried about having to make this stop, keeps her face turned away from the shack, not wishing it to be seen. \nNo one comes and for a moment Mary considers driving on, as if the emptiness of the station were a warning, an omen that she should listen to. But the gas registers almost empty. She has to blow her horn. \nA YOUNG MAN comes out of the shack, starts toward her car. \nAt that moment, we HEAR the RINGING of the TELEPHONE in the shack. The Attendant walks a few steps further, toward Mary's car, then decides to go back and answer the phone. The phone's insistent ringing unnerves Mary. \nShe starts her car, zooms off. \nWe see the Attendant, phone in hand, in the doorway of shack. He looks after the departing car with little or no expression. \nCAR \nThe car grows smaller as it races up the road. The sun is setting. There is something vaguely ominous about the darkening sky into which the car seems to be disappearing. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMARY IN CAR - (NIGHT) \nThe oncoming headlights hurt Mary's eyes. She is getting sleepy and her vision is blurring. Her eyes close, involuntarily, snap open again. She stretches than wide, as if forcing them to stay open. The oncoming lights seem to glare to a point beyond endurance. She murmurs \"Sam - Sam.\" \nLONG LAP DISSOLVE: \nEXT. ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN) \nWe see Mary's car, dim in the early dawn, tilted on the soft shoulder of the road, looking somehow sad and pathetic, like a child's thrown-away toy. And from this angle it would appear that the car is empty. \nAfter a moment, during which there are no other vehicles passing, we see, coming from the far distance, a HIGHWAY PATROLMAN in a patrol car. He passes Mary's car, notes its apparent emptiness, U-turns, comes back up behind the car. He gets out and approaches the driver's side window. \nEXT. MARY'S CAR - (DAWN) \nThe Patrolman looks down into the car. \nShe takes it, looks at him for a flicker of a moment. \nHe says nothing. She starts ahead, fast. \nEXT. ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN) \nThe Patrolman stares after Mary as she drives off, then starts back to his automobile. \nMARY IN CAR - (DAWN) \nShe is quite shaken, realizes she caused herself a great deal of trouble and placed herself in unnecessary danger. She is disturbed and angry and frightened at her inability to act normally under the pressure of guilt. As she drives, she glances into her rear-view mirror. \nMARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR - (DAWN) \nThe Patrolman is following in his automobile, keeping behind her at a matched speed. \nMARY IN CAR - (DAWN) \nShe glances out at her surroundings. \nMARY'S POV - (DAWN) \nThe Freeway ahead. \nEXT. MARY'S CAR - (DAWN) \nShe suddenly turns off the highway. \nMARY IN CAR - (DAWN) \nShe checks her mirror. \nMARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR - (DAWN) \nThe Patrolman is no longer following, has not turned off after her. \nMARY IN CAR - (DAWN) \nShe breathes a sigh of relief, thinks a moment, makes a quick decision. \nDISSOLVE: \nEXT. USED CAR LOT - (DAY) \nThe big sign reads \"California Charlie - Automobile Paradise.\" We see Mary's car drive onto the lot and stop. Mary gets out of the car, glances toward the lot office, turns her attention to the line of cars, notice the California licence plates on all of them. The CAR DEALER calls out from his office: \nCAR DEALER With you in a second! \nMary nods, starts walking along the line of cars as if making a selection. Her eye is caught by the iron newspaper stand on the corner, just outside the lot. \nShe stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, picks up a LOS ANGELES newspaper, starts back into the car lot as she glances worried at the front page. As she goes, we see, coming up the street toward the lot, the same PATROLMAN. He sees Mary, slows, swerves over to the opposite side of the street, stops by the curb. Mary, engrossed in the newspaper, and walking back ease the lot, does not see the Patrolman. \nThe car dealer is out on the lot now, standing and waiting for Mary. As she approaches, lost in her newspaper, he smiles. \nCAR DEALER I'm in no mood for trouble! \nMARY (glancing up, thrown for a moment) What? \nCAR DEALER (cheerfully) There's an old saying, \"First customer of the day is always the most trouble!\" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me... \nMARY (interrupting) Can I trade in my car and take another? \nCAR DEALER You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will! (chin-indicating her car) That yours? \nMARY Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just... \nCAR DEALER Sick of the sight of it! (laughs) Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about... \nMARY No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start... \nShe stops suddenly, almost with a gasp. She has seen the Patrolman. \nTHE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY) \nHe is staring over at her, his face dispassionate. \nCAR DEALER No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all. \nMARY (handing him the ownership papers and the new bills) I'd like to be ready when he gets back. \nCAR DEALER Okay. If you'll come along... \nHe starts toward the office building. Mary follows, closely, anxiously. She glances, sees: \nTHE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY) \nHe is still at the far curb. \nEXT. USED CAR LOT - (DAY) \nThe Car Dealer goes into his office. Mary follows. \nTHE PATROLMAN - (DAY) \nA second later, he starts his automobile, checks traffic, comes across the street, slowly, and drives onto the lot. He pauses a moment, then drives across the lot, passing the office, going on to the other exit, stops there as Mary's car is driven back onto the lot. \nThe MECHANIC stops Mary's car, hops out, waves to the Patrolman. The Patrolman waves back, goes on a bit until he is behind Mary's car, stops again, looks over at the office. In a moment, Mary comes out, hurries across to her new car, gets in, starts the motor. The Mechanic yells: \nMECHANIC Hey! Miss? \nMary pauses, turns, sees the Patrolman, then the Mechanic. Her face goes white. She doesn't know which man called her. Then the Mechanic waves, starts forward with her suitcase. \nMARY (as Mechanic reaches car) Just put it right in here, please... beside me. \nThe Mechanic smiles, throws the suitcase in. Mary zooms off. As she drives out of lot we see the Mechanic, the Car Dealer and the Patrolman all looking after her. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE \nMary is driving tensely. She checks the rear-view mirror, is more shocked than pleased when she sees... \nMARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR \nNo sign of the Patrolman. \nMARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE \nShe turns her face, looks out at the highway. \nROUTE 99 - MARY'S POV \nIt is heavy with traffic. \nMARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE \nAgain she checks the mirror and although... \nMARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR \nThere is still no sign of the Patrolman. \nMARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE \nShe cannot relax or feel safe, cannot convince herself that nothing will come of the man's watching and suspicions. \nCAMERA IS CLOSE on Mary's face now, recording her anxiety, her fears. Her guilt shines bright in her eyes and she is a person unaccustomed to containing this much guilt in this realistic a situation. Suddenly, we hear the SOUND of the Used Car Dealer's laugh, hear it as clearly as Mary hears it in her imagination. The \"imagined voice\" we hear is actually the voice of the Car Dealer: \nCAR DEALER'S VOICE Heck, Officer, that was the first time I ever saw the Customer high- pressure the Salesman!  Somebody chasing her? \nPATROLMAN'S VOICE I better have a look at those papers, Charlie. \nCAR DEALER'S VOICE She look like a wrong-one to you? \nPATROLMAN'S VOICE Acted like one. \nMary blinks, shakes her head, as if trying to shake away these voices of her imagination. She checks the rear-view mirror. \nMARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR \nStill no sight of the Patrolman. \nLOWERY'S VOICE After all, Cassidy, I told you... all that cash... I'm not taking the responsibility... Oh, for heaven's sake, a girl works for you for ten years, you trust her! All right, yes, you better come over. \nFROM MARY'S VIEWPOINT \nEXT. THE ROAD AHEAD INT. MARY'S NEW CAR \nFast cut back to Mary's face. Oncoming headlights throw a blinding light across her features. \nCASSIDY'S VOICE (undrunk, sharp with rage) Well I ain't about to kiss off forty thousand dollars! I'll get it back and if any of it's missin' I'll replace it with her fine soft flesh! I'll track her, never you doubt it! \nLOWERY'S VOICE Hold on, Cassidy... I still can't believe... it must be some kind of a mystery... I can't... \nCASSIDY'S VOICE You checked with the bank, no?  They never laid eyes on her, no?  You still trustin'? Hot creepers, she sat there while I dumped it out... hardly even looked at it, plannin' and... and even flirtin' with me...! \nA look of revulsion makes Mary close her eyes. \nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD AGAIN \nBig drops of rain begin to appear. \nCLOSEUP - MARY \nShe is becoming aware of the rain starting. \nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD \nThe rain increasing and backlit by the oncoming headlights. \nCLOSEUP - MARY \nMary starts the windshield wipers. \nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD \nThe wipers are having a battle with the now torrential rain. \nCLOSEUP - MARY \nPeering through the blurred windshield. \nCLOSEUP - THE CAR WHEELS \nslowing down in the flooding highway. \nCLOSEUP - MARY \npeering through the windshield. The oncoming lights are fewer. \nCLOSEUP - THE CAR WHEELS \nalmost coming to a slow turn. \nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD \njust blackness and rain. \nCLOSEUP - MARY \npeering. \nMARY'S VIEWPOINT \nAn almost undiscernible light in the far distance, a neon sign blurred by the rain-sheeted windshield. \nMARY'S CAR \nShe presses down, forces the car to move on through the flooded road. \nEXT. THE ROAD \nAs we move closer, we see the neon sign more clearly and can faintly make out the large letters which read \"Motel.\"  Mary stops the car, lowers the window slightly, looks out. We see the sign clearly now: \"BATES MOTEL.\" Mary opens the car door and dashes out into the rain and up onto the porch of the motel office. \nEXT. BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT) \nMary pauses on the porch. The lights are on within the office. She tries door, finds it open, goes into office. CAMERA FOLLOWS her into office. There is no one present. Mary goes to the desk, rings a small pushbell. There is no response. Mary rubs her forehead in weariness and frustration, goes back out onto the porch. She looks off in another direction, slightly behind the office, and sees... \nNORMAN You have something most girls never have. \nMARY I have? \nNORMAN There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease. \nMARY Thank you. Again. \nNORMAN (not really a question) You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you? \nMARY No. \nNORMAN Then will you do me a favor? (without waiting for her response) Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey. \nMARY I'd like to. \nNORMAN All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready... (starts out) ...with my trusty umbrella. (he laughs a small laugh, runs off) \nMary closes the door, goes to suitcase, opens it, starts to take out a dress. Her handbag is next to the suitcase. She glances down into it, pauses, drops the dress, reaches into the handbag, takes out the money-filled envelope, stares at it, almost with regret, filled contemplates hiding it, decides to, starts looking for a reasonable hiding place. She looks about, at the closet, the drawers etc., realizes all such places are obvious. Catching sight of the newspaper in her bag, she hits on a solution. She opens the newspaper, places the envelope within it, lock-folds the paper again and then places it on the bedside table as if it were there for later reading. She considers this for a moment, accepts it, goes to her suitcase to start unpacking. \nSuddenly the quiet is shattered by the shrill, ugly sound of a woman's voice, raised in anger. \nWOMAN'S VOICE No! I tell you no! \nMary walks slowly to the window, realizing that the terrible voice is coming from the house behind the cabins. CAMERA FOLLOWS her to window and once there we see the light is still on in the upstairs bedroom and the voice is coming from that room. The rain has stopped and the moon is out. \nWOMAN'S VOICE I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper... (an ugly, sneering note creeps into the voice) ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds! \nNORMAN'S VOICE Mother, please... \nWOMAN'S VOICE And then what? After supper, music? Whispers? \nNORMAN'S VOICE Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad... \nWOMAN'S VOICE (mimicking cruelly) Mother, she's just a stranger! (hard, cruel again) As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy? \nWOMAN'S VOICE (pause) Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy? \nNORMAN'S VOICE (blurted cut fury and shame) Shut up! Shut up! \nThere is the SOUND of a door closing in that room up there. Mary has stood by the window, listening with mounting distress and concern and sympathy. She turns her face away now, gazes sadly at the little empty room. \nIn a moment there is the SOUND of the house's front door slamming shut. Mary turns, looks out the window. \nFROM MARY'S VIEWPOINT - (NIGHT) \nWe see Norman coming down the path, carrying a napkin-covered tray. \nINT. CABIN ONE - (NIGHT) \nMary looks at him for a moment, then turns quickly, goes to the door, opens it and goes out onto the porch. \nEXT. THE MOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT) \nMary pauses outside the door, is about to start forward when Norman comes round the building and walks along the porch, past the office, stopping only when he is close to her. He stares with painful embarrassment at the knowing look in her eye. \nMARY I've caused you some trouble. \nNORMAN Mother... (a hollow little laugh, an attempt at sardonic humor) ...what is the phrase... \"she isn't herself today\"... I think that's it. \nMARY (looking at the tray) You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite. \nNorman flinches, realizing she has heard his mother's reference to Mary's appetite. \nNORMAN I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people. \nMARY Don't worry about it. (a warm smile) But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh? \nShe begins to back into her room. Norman starts to follow, hesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young woman and a motel room. Bringing down the tray of food, in defiance of his mother's orders, is about the limit of his defiance for one day. He cannot go into Mary's room. \nNORMAN It might be nicer... warmer in the office. \nWithout waiting for approval or disapproval, he turns, hurries to the office. Mary looks after him, her face showing amused sympathy, then follows. \nINT. THE MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT) \nNORMAN Oh I do... but I say I don't. (Laughs boyishly) \nMARY (Staring at him, shaking her head softly.) If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again. \nNORMAN (Controlled resentment) Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever! (A rueful smile) Or at least, defy her. (A pause, a hopeless shrug) But I couldn't. She's ill. \nMARY She sounded strong... \nNORMAN I mean... ill. (A pause) She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating. (Pauses, smiles) Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left. \nMARY (Critically) Except you. \nNORMAN A son is a poor substitute for a lover. (Turns away as if in distaste of the word) \nMARY Why don't you go away? \nNORMAN To a private island, like you? \nMARY No, not like me. \nNORMAN It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness. \nMARY (Slowly, carefully) Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace... \nShe hesitates. Norman turns, slowly, looking at her with a striking coldness. \nNORMAN An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse \"someplace.\" (Mimicing coldly) Put her in Someplace! \nMARY I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring... \nNORMAN (The coldness turning to tight fury) What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds. \nMARY I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant... \nNORMAN (High fury now) Well? You meant well?  People always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that... \nThe fury suddenly dies, abruptly and completely, and he sinks back into his chair. There is a brief silence. \nMary watches the troubled man, is almost physically pained by his anguish. \nNORMAN (Quietly) I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't... (Looks up with a childlike pleading in his eyes) ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you? \nMARY (After a long thoughtful pause) Yes, and just one time can be enough. (Rises) Thank you. \nNORMAN (Cheerfully, correcting) Thank you, Norman. \nMARY Norman. \nNORMAN You're not going to... to your room already? \nMARY I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix. \nNORMAN Phoenix? \nMARY I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out. (Looking close at Norman) Before it's too late for me, too. \nNORMAN (Looking at her) Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking. \nMARY I'd like to, but... \nNORMAN Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you... \nMARY Very early. Dawn. \nNORMAN Alright, Miss... (He has forgotten her name) \nMARY Crane. \nNORMAN That's it. (He frowns, as if bothered by not being able to match the name to the memory of the name in the registration book) \nMARY Good night. \nShe goes out of the parlor. We see her, from Norman's viewpoint, as she crosses the small office, goes out into the night. Norman turns and looks at the table, and we see his face now. It is bright with that drunken-like look of determination and encouragement and like resolve. He starts to clean up the table, pauses as he hears the closing of Mary's door in the cabin next door. \nHe holds still, listens. He goes into the office and looks at the book. \nAn impression of a knife slashing, as if tearing at the very screen, ripping the film. Over it the brief gulps of screaming. And then silence. And then the dreadful thump as Mary's body falls in the tub. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nThe blank whiteness, the blur of the shower water, the hand pulling the shower curtain back. We catch one flicker of a glimpse of the murderer. A woman, her face contorted with madness, her head wild with hair, as if she were wearing a fright-wig.  And then we see only the curtain, closed across the tub, and hear the rush of the shower water. Above the shower-bar we see the bathroom door open again and after a moment we HEAR the SOUND of the front door slamming. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DEAD BODY \nLying half in, half out of the tub, the head tumbled over, touching the floor, the hair wet, one eye wide open as if popped, one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor. Coming down the side of the tub, running thick and dark along the porcelain, we see many small threads of blood. CAMERA FOLLOWS away from the body, travels slowly across the bathroom, past the toilet, out into the bedroom. As CAMERA approaches the bed, we see the folded newspaper as Mary placed it on the bedside table. \nCLOSE UP - THE NEWSPAPER \nbeside the bed. The CAMERA now moves away over to the window and looks up to the house, and as it gets there we HEAR, coming from within the house, the SOUND of Norman's fearful, shocked voice. \nNORMAN'S VOICE Mother! Oh God, what... blood, blood... mother...! \nWe cannot entirely distinguish these exclamations. \nAfter a moment or two of silence, Norman emerges from the front door, dashes down the path toward the motel. \nQUICK CUT TO: \nEXT. THE PATH - (NIGHT) \nNorman is coming AT CAMERA, running head-on. He dashes into an extreme close up and we see the terror and fear ripe in his face. CAMERA PANS as Norman races past, holds as Norman runs to the porch and quickly along it and directly to Mary's room. \nINT. MARY'S CABIN - (NIGHT) \nNorman pauses a moment in the doorway, glances about the room, hears the shower going, sees the bathroom door is open. He goes to the bathroom, looks in, sees the body. \nSlowly, almost carefully, he raises his hands to his face, covers his eyes, turns his face away. Then he crosses to the window, looks out at the house. Shot is so angled that we see the bedside table with the newspaper on it. \nAfter a moment, Norman moves from the window, sinks onto the edge of the bed. \nFRESH ANGLE - BEHIND NORMAN \nNorman sitting on bed, the bathroom in b.g. of shot. We can see only the hand of the dead girl, lying along the tile floor. Norman presses his eyes, fights to find a way out of his dilemma. Slowly, a kind of settling comes upon him, the peace that comes with decision. \nNorman rises, goes to the window, looks out, and then, with resolution, closes the window and draws the curtain across it. Then he crosses to the front window, facing the porch, and draws those curtains closed. Then he switches off the bedroom light, leaving the room lit only by the spill from the bathroom. He opens the front door, goes out. \nEXT. THE HOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT) \nNorman comes out of Mary's cabin, closes the door carefully behind him, goes along the porch to his office, goes in. We stay outside. Immediately, the \"Vacancy\" sign goes off, and then the motel sign goes off. As CAMERA GOES closer to the office, the lights within go off and we HEAR a closet door opening and then the SOUND of a pail being picked up. Norman comes out of office, closes door, looks cautiously about, goes along porch, carrying pail with mop in it, goes into Mary's cabin, closing the door after him. \nINT. MARY'S CABIN \nWith the paper in the foreground, Norman enters. We can see him in the dim spill of light. He pauses by the door, then gathers his strength and goes into the bathroom. We HEAR him set the pail on the tiled floor, and then we HEAR the shower being turned off. And there is total silence. CAMERA MOVES FORWARD so that we can see into bathroom. \nCAMERA is ANGLED that we see Norman only from the waist up. Quickly and deftly he unhooks the shower curtain, emerges with it into the bedroom. CAMERA PANS down and we see him spread the shower curtain on the bedroom floor, just outside the bathroom door. He spreads the curtain so that one end of it comes up against the bathroom threshold and slightly over and onto the tile floor. Again he goes into the bathroom and CAMERA TILTS up so that we see only the upper half of Norman. He works carefully, with his arms extended away from his body, slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub, drags it across the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain in the bedroom. Having arranged the body, he straightens up, examines his hands, sees bloodstains on them. He returns to the bathroom, goes to the hand-basin. \nCLOSE SHOT \nWe see his hands being washed, see the bloodstains being diluted and washed away by the gush of the faucet water. \nNORMAN \nWe see Norman shake his hands free of the water, then turn to the job of cleaning the bathroom. \nHe places the pail in the tub, runs water into it, dips the mop in, swabs the tile floor. With a towel he wipes off the wall over the tub and the edges and sides of the tub and even the shower curtain rod. Then he takes a second towel and goes over the cleaned areas, carefully drying them. Finally he rinses and squeezes out the mop, empties the pail, cleans out the tub, and goes out into the bedroom. \nINT. MARY'S BEDROOM \nNorman steps carefully around the unseen body, crosses to the desk, starts going through Mary's handbag, in search of her car keys. He suddenly notices them lying on the desk, where he'd thrown them after parking her car. He picks up the keys, crosses the room, goes out. \nEXT. THE PORCH \nWe see Norman pauses at the door, check cautiously, then hurry across the porch and into Mary's car. He circle-turns the car, so that its trunk is backed up to the turns porch, directly opposite Mary's door, as close as it can go. \nThen he alights, goes to the trunk, opens it with the key and, leaving the trunk lid raised, goes back into the cabin. \nINT. MARY'S ROOM \nFrom a raised angle, we see Norman bend down and begin to wrap the shower curtain around the body. We see the edges of the curtain as they are raised and laid down again. Then he picks up the wrapped body, crosses to the door, uses his foot to pull the door open, and, leaving the door open behind him, goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body in the trunk. He closes the lid then, but does not lock it. He comes back into the cabin, closes the door completely, flicks on the light. \nLila starts to walk toward the counter, never taking her eyes off Bob. As she approaches, she asks quietly: \nLILA Sam? \nSUMMERFIELD You want to see Sam? \nLILA Sam Loomis. \nSUMMERFIELD (yelling toward back room) Sam! Lady wants to see you! \nLila looks to the back room. The woman customer goes on worriedly examining the fine print of the insecticide can. Sam comes to the door of his room, pauses, looks at Lila a moment, starts toward her, his expression indicating that he does not know her. Lila studies him with a quiet, worried expression. \nSAM Yes? \nLILA May I talk to you? \nSAM (a bit mystified) Sure... \nLila glances at the customer and the clerk, turns, starts toward the front of the store. Sam holds a moment, then follows. As he reaches her, she turns, her eyes studying him intently as she says: \nLILA I'm Mary's sister. \nSAM Lila. \nLILA (quickly) Is Mary here? \nSam is mystified, and is also aware of the worried, hostile expression on Lila's face. He studies her for a quiet moment. Behind them is a display of various size carving knives. \nSAM Is something wrong? \nLILA I want to know if my sister is here. \nSAM Here? \nLILA With you. \nSAM Where? \nLILA I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere. \nSAM What's the matter? \nLILA Don't you know? \nAs Sam is about to speak, the Woman Customer comes sailing past, speaking as she goes and wearing a satisfied smile. \nWOMAN CUSTOMER All I can do is hope if it isn't painless, it's quick! \nShe speaks \"quick\" with a kind of delicious bite, nods happily, goes on out of the store. Sam is now staring apprehensively at Lila. \nSAM What should I know? \nLILA To begin with, where Mary is. Do you? \nSAM No. I take it you don't either? (As Lila shakes her head) How long? \nLILA Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call. \nSAM And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you? \nLILA A good reason, I suppose. \nSAM (Slightly exasperated) Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and... \nLILA Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing. \nSAM I was getting to that! \nLILA What do you know about it? \nSAM Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive. \nLILA Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and... \nShe stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, her eyes beginning to fill with worried tears. Sam studies her for a moment, then turns and calls: \nARBOGAST With a little checking, I could get to believe you. \nLILA (anxiously) I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper... \nSAM Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up... \nARBOGAST She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add. \nSAM (after a moment) I don't believe it. (to Lila, slowly) Do you? \nLILA (a thoughtful pause) Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me... \nSAM You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister. \nLila turns from Sam, a flush of guilt and regret in her face. Arbogast looks at her, quiet sympathetically. \nARBOGAST We're always quickest to doubt people who have a record for being honest. I think she's here, Miss Crane. Where there's a boyfriend... (Trails off, smiles encouragingly) She won't be back there among the nuts and bolts... but she'll be in this town... somewhere. I'll find her. \nHe nods, takes down the closed-for-lunch sign, sails it to the counter, opens door, goes out into the street. \nAfter a quiet moment: \nLILA I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'... \nSAM It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police? \nLILA No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police. \nSAM He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash... \nLILA I ought to call the police right now! \nSAM No. \nLILA Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money? \nSAM How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my... (Smiles at the incongruity of his reply, then goes serious) If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us... \nLILA She haven't even called you? \nSAM I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that! \nLILA I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand. \nSAM You've led a charmed life. \nLILA No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle... \nSAM Maybe we can handle it together. (He smiles encouragingly) \nLILA (A rueful shrug) I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home. \nSAM (A thoughtful pause) I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here. \nLILA (A long study, her suspicion of him evaporating) You want me to stay here? \nSAM She'll need both of us. \nLILA (considers, then:) Where... can I stay? \nSAM (brightly) First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on. (as he reaches for the closed-for-lunch sign) After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait. \nHe hangs the sign on the door, ushers Lila out, closes door behind him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - (DAY) \nThey emerge from the store and walk along to the hotel.  As they enter, Arbogast is in the act of taking over a white Ford sedan from a rental car man. They glance at him and he returns a cynical look. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. HOTEL - (DAY) \nOutside another hotel we see Arbogast alight from the white car and go into new hotel. \nNORMAN My mother. \nArbogast turns, gazes seriously at him. \nNORMAN She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone. \nARBOGAST (after a pause) If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you? \nNORMAN Of course not. \nARBOGAST If she paid you well? \nNORMAN Now, look...! \nARBOGAST Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you? \nNORMAN I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women! \nARBOGAST I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry. \nNORMAN (disturbed now) That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But... (a rueful smile) She didn't fool my mother. \nARBOGAST Your mother met her? (quickly) Can I talk to your mother? \nNORMAN No. I told you, she's confined... \nARBOGAST Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss. \nARBOGAST Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb... \nNORMAN No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think... \nARBOGAST All right! (starts away, toward his car, pauses) Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother.  But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I? \nNorman does not respond. Arbogast gets in his car, starts the motor. Norman looks up, studies the man's face, his own face showing apprehension. Arbogast backs the car around very slowly, his gaze divided between the old house and the lighted window of Cabin Two. As he turns the car out, his headlights light up the porch. \nNorman stands, watching him drive away. \nEXT. PHONE BOOTH - (NIGHT) \nThe car pulls up and Arbogast gets out of car, leaving motor running. As he starts to walk across the highway, CAMERA PULLS AWAY and we \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGHWAY WITH TELEPHONE BOOTH - (NIGHT) \nArbogast gets to the phone booth, enters. CAMERA STARTS FORWARD, and we see Arbogast remove a small notebook from his pocket, check on a number, drop a dime in the slot and dial this number. As we reach phone booth, \nCUT TO: \nARBOGAST (into phone) Miss Crane, please. (listens) She leave a number? (listens) Thanks. (hangs up, dials again, waits) Lila there, Mr. Loomis? Arbogast. (waits) Lila? Look, this isn't much, but it might make you feel a little better. Mary was up here. Spent last Saturday night at Bates'  Motel, out here on the old highway. (listens) Young fellow runs it, said Mary spent the night, left, period! (listens) I did question him, believe me. I think I got all there was to get. Just have to try to pick up the scent from here. (listens) Well... maybe that's because I don't feel entirely satisfied.  He's got a sick old mother, confined type, and I think she saw Mary and talked to her. Shame, too... confined old women love to talk to strangers. (listens) I was, but I think I'll go back to the motel, first. (listens) No, you stay put, Lila. With Loomis. I should be back in an hour. (listens) All right. And Lila... You'll be happy to know what I think. I think our friend Sam Loomis didn't even know Mary was here. (smiles) See you in an hour. Or less. \nHe hangs up, gets out of the phone booth. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT) \nA distant view of the House and Motel. There is a light on in the house. There is also a light on in Norman's office. We see Norman emerge from his office and move along the porch toward the distant cabins. He carries sheets on his arm. He goes into the last cabin and switches the light on. Into the foreground the hood of the white Ford enters the scene and stops. Arbogast gets out. He goes over to the Motel office. \nEXT. MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT) \nArbogast goes in. \nINT. OFFICE - (NIGHT) \nArbogast looks around the empty office and calls. \nARBOGAST Bates! \nHe goes over to the door to the parlor and enters. He looks around the bird-ridden room. He stops short as he sees: \nC.U. - THE OLD SAFE IN THE CORNER \nC.U. - ARBOGAST \nSAM Hundreds! Which one is your pet? \nLILA Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better. \nSAM I feel better when you feel better. \nLILA (a pause - then she rises) Where's the old highway? \nSAM You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours. \nLILA Yes. \nSAM That wouldn't be a wise thing to do. \nLILA Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there! \nSAM Arbogast said... \nLILA An hour! Or less! \nSam stares at her, frowns in concern over her very real anxiety, goes to the phone, dials operator. \nSAM (into phone) Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. (waits) \nLILA Sam! Why call when we can go? \nSAM And maybe pass Arbogast on the road? (into phone) Thanks. \nHe presses down the receiver, releases it, dials Bates' \nMotel. The faint other-end ringing tones can be heard, repeatedly, annoyingly. He waits. \nSAM (to Lila) Probably on his way back right now. \nLILA Sam, I'm going. \nSAM (hangs up and picks up his jacket) You'll never find it. \nHe starts for the door. Lila follows after him into the store. \nINT. STORE \nHe pauses halfway down, turns, puts his hands on her arms. \nSAM Stay here. \nLILA Why can't I go out there with you? \nSAM (looks at her) I don't know... (he collects himself) One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way. \nLILA (nervously) Just wait here? \nSAM (a warm smile) Contemplate your... panic button. \nHe hurries down to the street door and out. CAMERA HOLDS on Lila as she stares after Sam. As she stands alone in the darkened store, all the hardware seems to take on sinister shapes. \nC.U. \nAmong some bathroom fittings a nozzle from a shower falls onto the floor. \nMEDIUM SHOT \nLila turns and picks if from the floor and puts it back in its place. She turns and again looks to the deserted street with a touch of anxiety. She gives a slight unconscious shiver. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. THE SWAMP - (NIGHT) \nTall and lonely still against the moonlight, the figure of Norman, silhouetted. He doesn't move, merely stands there at the edge of the swamp, staring down at the now calm and quiet face of it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE MOTEL AND HOUSE - (NIGHT) \nAll light are out, except the light in Norman's mother's room. And her figure can be seen sitting in the window, relaxed in a high-back chair, her face turned into the room. After a second, we hear the SOUND OF A MOTOR, and then Sam's small pick-up truck swings into the driveway. \nMRS. CHAMBERS You didn't! (a cross look up at the bell) It's tinkerbell. (a quick smile at Lila) Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night. (to Sam) Well come on in, at least! \nAs she opens the door wide, \nCUT TO: \nINT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL OF SHERIFF'S HOUSE - (NIGHT) \nFat roses splatter the wallpaper. The stairs are carpeted. The lighting is bright. \nThere is a perfectly fitting wall phone by the parlor arch. Mrs. Chambers goes to the stairway, yells up. \nMRS. CHAMBERS Albert! (a tiny wait, a smile as Sam and Lila enter) Al Chambers! \nSam is about to close the door behind him. Mrs. Chambers motions for him not to, scurries across the hall, leans outside, presses the doorbell. The RING within the house is even more shattering. She closes the door, starts to the stairway, pauses as the SOUNDS of movement above COME OVER SHOT. \nMRS. CHAMBERS Customers! \nSHERIFF CHAMBERS comes down the stairs, in a bathrobe which matches his wife's. He is a tall, narrow man with a face originally destined for Mount Rushmore. He nods at Sam, looks at him with wide-awake eyes and a no-nonsense concern. \nSAM We have a problem. \nMRS. CHAMBERS (to Lila) Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking. \nLILA No, thank you. It's my problem, too. \nSAM I don't know where to start... (a look at Lila) Except at the beginning. \nLILA Yes. \nSAM (to Sheriff) This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary... \nMRS. CHAMBERS Mary is Lila's sister? \nSAM Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway... \nMRS. CHAMBERS (to the Sheriff) Bates' Motel. (to Lila) He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam. \nSAM He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates... \nMRS. CHAMBERS (a pleasant shock) Norman took a wife? \nSAM No. An old woman, his mother. (to Sheriff, quickly) That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and... \nLILA (interrupting, anxiously) Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there! \nSHERIFF (after a considerate pause) Now. Your sister is missing how long? \nLILA She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until... \nSHERIFF How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale? \nSAM They thought she'd be coming to me. \nSHERIFF Left Phoenix under her own steam? \nLILA Yes. \nSHERIFF (a pause) She ain't missing so much as she's run away. \nSAM Yes. \nSHERIFF From what? \nLILA (a look at sam, then:) She stole some money. \nSHERIFF A lot? \nLILA Forty thousand dollars. \nSHERIFF And the police haven't been able to... \nSAM (interrupting) Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police. \nSHERIFF Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you? \nMRS. CHAMBERS (hopefully, happily) Maybe you saw Mary! \nSAM I'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman. \nSHERIFF Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman? \nSAM Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me. \nSHERIFF And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother. \nLILA It must've been. Arbogast said so, too... and he said the young man wouldn't let him see her because she was ill! \nThe Sheriff stares at both of them, and when he finally speaks there is an almost inaudible tone or irony in his voice. \nSHERIFF Well, if the woman up there is Mrs. Bates... who's that woman buried out at Greenlawn Cemetery? \nQUICK CUT TO: \nINT. NORMAN'S PARLOR BEHIND OFFICE - (NIGHT) \nNorman sits in the dim, one-lamp light, the phone next to him, his hand still near it as if he had not been able to move his hand after hanging up. He is staring at the shrike- like bird which is perched on the lamp shade. Decision and resolution are beginning to show in his face. Suddenly he rises, starts quickly out of the room, tries to switch off the lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking the bird off the shade. \nHe watches it fall, does not try to catch it. It hits the floor with a thud and sawdust spills out. He stares sadly at it, for a moment, then tends down, scoops up the sawdust, tries to press it into the split seam, picks up the bird, puts it in a drawer. Then he puts out the lamp, goes out, crosses the darkened office and goes outside. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOTEL AND HOUSE - (NIGHT) \nNorman comes off the porch, walks to the path and directly up to the house, opens the door and goes in. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY AND STAIRWAY - (NIGHT) \nSHOOTING UP THE STAIRS \nNorman goes up, pauses one moment outside his mother's door, then opens it and goes in, leaving the door open. \nFor a moment we hear only Norman's low, quiet voice, his words indistinguishable. Then we hear the cold shot of his mother's derisive laughter. \nMOTHER'S VOICE I am sorry, boy, but you do manage to look ludicrous when you give me orders! \nNORMAN'S VOICE Please, mother... \nMOTHER'S VOICE (Sharp, laughter all gone) No! I will not hide in the fruit cellar! (A shrill laugh) Think I'm fruity, huh? (Hard, cold again) I'm staying right here!  This is my room and no one will drag me out of it... least of all my big bold son! \nNORMAN'S VOICE (Rising now, anxiously) They'll come now, Mother. He came after the girl and now someone will come after him! How long do you think you can go on... Mother, please, just for a few days, just so they won't find you! \nMOTHER'S VOICE (Mimicking) Just for a few days... (Furious) In that dank fruit cellar? No!  You hid me there once, boy, and you won't do it again! Not ever again!  Now get out! (A pause, quiet) I told you to get out, boy! (A longer pause) Norman! What do you think you're going to do? Don't you touch me! Don't! Norman! (A pause, then cajolingly) All right, son, put me down and I'll go. I'll go on my own two feet. I can go on my own two feet, can't I? \nDuring all this the CAMERA has been slowly creeping up the stairs. It does not stop at the top however, but continues on the same high angle that we had in Scene 57. \nShe starts to laugh, a terrible sound like an obscene melody. \nNORMAN'S VOICE I'll carry you, mother. \nNorman comes out of the room, his mother held in his arms, her head leaning against his shoulder. He carries her down the stairs, along the lower landing to the cellar stairs, and then down those stairs to the basement. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. FAIRVALE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - (MORNING) \nAn overcast morning, but a sunny-faced crowd. The service is just over, there is contentment, and peace, and just a little I-went-to-church-smugness in the faces of the churchgoers as they come out of the chapel, and spread their separate ways away. \nAmongst the crowd, waiting and searching the faces, are Sam and Lila. In their expressions there is no peace, no contentment. CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE. They are not speaking. Lila looks as if she has had no sleep. \nSuddenly, Sam becomes alert, takes Lila's arm, starts toward the church. \nCAMERA MOVES WITH THEM, stops as they approach Sheriff and Mrs. Chambers. The Sheriff stares rather sympathetically at Lila. Mrs. Chambers smiles nicely. \nSAM We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you. \nMRS. CHAMBERS He's already been. \nSHERIFF Went out before service. \nSAM We were going to get married. Are going to get married! \nLILA Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam. \nSAM This is the old highway. \nLILA I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper. \nSAM Watch your tenses. \nLILA Huh? \nSAM She always tries to be proper. \nSam slows the truck to a stop, sighs, starts to light up a cigarette. Lila looks questioningly and impatiently at him. \nLILA You going to wait here for me? \nSAM I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in... \nLILA We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside. \nSAM You won't believe it... (Starts motor) But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers! \nLILA (A tiny smile, first in hours) I believe it. \nAs truck starts to drive on, \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE BATES MOTEL AND HOUSE - (DAY) \nThe place is empty and silent and washed dirty by the deep gray of the cloudy sky. We see Sam's truck turning into the driveway and pulling to a stop. After a moment, Sam and Lila get out of the truck. \nFRESH ANGLE \nClose on Sam and Lila as they meet on the porch side of the truck. The motel office and the house beyond can be seen in b.g. of shot. Sam and Lila merely stare for a moment, then turn and gaze up at the house. There is no figure in the window and the shade is drawn. Same goes to the office door, peers in, knocks, opens door, enters. Lila remains on the driveway, beside the truck. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE MOTHER'S ROOM - (DAY) \nCLOSE ANGLE on Norman standing by the window. He has pulled the curtains very slightly apart, is staring out and down at the motel, his eyes studying the lone figure of Lila, who is standing by the truck and looking up at the house.  Norman studies her, and as her eyes look up at this very window he closes the curtains, turns away. \nWe see the suspicion and fear in his face, the surge of panic and his struggle to contain it. Then he goes away. CAMERA remains on window, shooting out and down, and through the frail curtains we can see Sam as he comes out of the motel office and joins Lila. \nEXT. MOTEL OFFICE - CLOSE ON SAM AND LILA \nSAM (Unconsciously whispering) I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting? \nLILA Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move. \nSam takes Lila's arm. \nSAM Come on. \nHe starts with her toward the path which leads to the old house. CAMERA PANS with them, and as they turn around the office corner, they see Norman coming down the path toward them. They pause and Norman pauses. He does not smile, nor speak. His usual grin and soft friendliness are gone; containment and impassivity lie in their place. \nSAM (Cheerfully) Just coming up to ring for you. \nNORMAN (Coming forward) I suppose you want a cabin. \nSAM We'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it. \nNorman walks past Sam, giving him the sort of quick, disapproving glance one gives a man who is obviously lying, goes onto the porch and into the office. Sam and Lila follow Norman. \nINT. MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY) \nNorman crosses to the desk, goes behind it, takes the key to cabin number twelve off the keyboard. Sam and Lila have entered and are almost to the desk-counter by this time. \nNORMAN I'll take you to... \nSAM Better sign in first, hasn't we? \nSam eyes scan the counter, looking for a registration book. \nLila's hand pushes the door open. We see the hallway. \nLila ENTERS PAST CAMERA. \nINT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY OF OLD HOUSE - (DAY) \nLila closes the door, remains by it for a moment, quiet, listening. Her eyes scan the layout, the closed door which leads off the hallway, to the dining room on the right and the parlor on the left. Down at the end of the hall is the kitchen, the door wide open, the room beyond dim and silent. She notices the stairs leading down to the basement, stares at them, then back to the stairs leading to the second floor. She starts forward, and seems about to investigate the parlor and dining room. \nINT. THE MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY) \nNorman is behind the counter, standing, staring at Sam who is sitting relaxedly on a small sofa. Norman has the look of one who is protecting himself, as if the counter were a protective wall against the threatening world across it. \nSAM (Cheerfully, as if after a self-conscious pause) I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I? \nNORMAN Yes. \nSAM I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening! (A pause) You are alone here, aren't you? (As Norman does not reply) It would drive me crazy. \nNORMAN That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it? \nSAM (Lightly) Just an expression... (More seriously) What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you? \nINT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY AND STAIRS OF OLD HOUSE - (DAY) \nLila is halfway up the stairs. As she climbs she is startled by the creaks and groans of the old wood of the steps. She steps more carefully. CAMERA remains at foot of stair, TILTING UP as Lila climbs. She pauses at the head of the stair. The door on her right, which opens into the mother's room, is closed. To her left is another door, half-open. Directly before her is a third door, closed. She holds a long moment, trying to picture in her mind which room would look out on the front of the house, decides, chooses the correct door, the one on her right. She goes to it, knocks lightly. \nINT. THE MOTHER'S ROOM (DAY) - CLOSE ANGLE ON DOOR \nWe hear Lila's second knock, then, faintly, her soft call. \nLILA'S VOICE (O.S.) Mrs. Bates? \nThere is quiet for a moment, then the door begins to open, and we see Lila. She stands on the threshold, looking in at the room, instantly disturbed by it, almost chilled, her expression indicating an impulse to close the door and go away from this room forever. \nAfter a moment, she enters, leaving the door open behind her. CAMERA PULLS BACK AND AWAY and we now see the room as Lila sees it. \nIt is ornate, damask-and-mahogany, thick and warm and ripe, an olla podrida of mismated furnishings and bric-a-brac of the last century. The bed is four poster, but uncanoped; the dressing table is fancy and flounced with satin; there is a great chiffonier, a big-doored wardrobe, a large, oval, full- length pier-glass (this against the wall directly opposite the door), a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair by the window, a white marble fireplace, its grate cold but piled with ashes. \nAnd there is in the room an unmistakably live quality, as if even though it is presently unoccupied, it has not been long vacated by some musty presence. \nLila glances at the bed. The damask coverlet is thrown over it, but it is not neat, there is the imprint of a body on it, a body which obviously has slept in a curled-up, womb- like position. Lila stares at it for a moment, up, then goes to the dressing table. Its top is scattered with boxes and jars of cosmetics and creams, traces of fresh powder, an opened bottle or perfume, a comb, and a brush with traces of hair in its bristles. Lila moves on, catches a glimpse of herself in the pier-glass, is startled, turns away, goes to the chiffonier, is about to open a drawer, sees the high wardrobe out of the corner of her eyes, goes to it, hesitantly. She opens one door. Fresh, clean, well pressed dresses hang neatly. Lila opens the other door. The sweaters and dresses and robes hang freely, none in moth-proof, storage- type bags. There is even a well-brushed collar of foxes. Along the floor of the wardrobe is a line of clean, polished shoes. Lila stares, then closes the door, turns, looks once again over the whole room, starts out, \nINT. THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY) \nLila comes out of the mother's room, closes the door behind her, looks down the stairs, then starts across the hall to the room whose door is half-open. The room within is dark, the shades drawn full. \nLila pauses on the threshold, reaches in, feels the wall, throws on a switch. \nINT. MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY) \nSam has risen, is standing by the counter now. \nSAM I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place... \nNORMAN (Angrily) This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy. \nSAM And now that your mother's dead? \nNorman snaps a sharp, fast, ugly look at him. \nNORMAN My mother is not dead! \nSAM (Softly) I didn't think so. \nINT. NORMAN'S ROOM IN THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY) \nLila is standing in the doorway, staring at the room in sick dismay. The room is grotesque, a horrible, ludicrous fantasy of childhood held beyond the point of decency. \nIt is a small room. The walls are fancied with romping silhouettes of teddy-bears and sailboats and carousels and fat cows jumping over aghast moons. The bed is small, far too short for a man of Norman's height. And yet the rumpled covers indicate that it is in this bed that Norman sleeps. Next to the bed is an old-fashioned toy chest. On its top there are a bird-in-a-cage lamp, a plain-bound book, and an ash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs. A grown man's shirt hangs on a child's clothes tree. \nAgainst one wall there is a narrow, high bookcase filled with thick, unchildish-looking books. On the small, white chest of drawers there is an old, child's victrola. The record on the turntable is discovered, on close inspection, to be Beethoven's Eroica Symphony. \nLila studies the room, fascinated and repelled. She glances at the bookcase, comes into the room, goes to the bookcase and pulls out a thick, large, plain-bound book. She opens it. Her eyes go wide in shock. And then there is disgust. She slams the book closed, drops it. \nINT. THE MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY) \n", "test1_input": "INT. MOTEL OFFICE - (TWILIGHT) \nNorman switches on the overhead light, starts for the linen closet, suddenly pauses, turns, studies Arbogast, who has remained standing by the door. \nNORMAN You out to buy a motel? \nARBOGAST No. \nNORMAN Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask? \nARBOGAST I'm looking for a missing person. (takes out and opens wallet and extends it as he speaks) My name's Arbogast, private investigator... (takes back wallet when Norman doesn't look at it) Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix. (A look at Norman's frightened expression) It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her... (smiles) She isn't in trouble. \nNORMAN (forcing a smile) I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble. \nARBOGAST I'm not the police. \nNORMAN Oh. \nHe waits a moment, then opens closet, starts counting out sheets and pillow cases, keeps his back to Arbogast. \nArbogast takes a photograph out of his pocket, talks as he crosses to Norman. \nARBOGAST We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area... (extends photograph, which Norman doesn't glance at) Did she stop here? \nNORMAN No. No one has stopped here in weeks... \nARBOGAST Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself? \nNORMAN Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman. \nARBOGAST Look at the picture. Please. \nNorman glances, briefly, turns away, lifts sheets and pillow cases off the shelf holds them close, almost protectively. \nNORMAN No. At least I don't recall. \nARBOGAST She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered... \nNORMAN (interrupting) I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities. (more relaxed, because Arbogast is listening with a pleasant smile) I shouldn't even bother to change the linen. I guess habits die hard. Which reminds me... \nHe goes to the wall, flips a light switch. \nNORMAN The vacancy sign. Just in case. \nWe had a couple the other night, said if the sign hasn't been on they'd have thought this was an old deserted mining town or something. \nARBOGAST Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them? \nNORMAN What? \nARBOGAST You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl... \nARBOGAST (A pause, a study) Maybe she even signed the register... because habits die hard. Let's check it, huh? \nNorman says nothing. Arbogast goes to the desk, pulls the registry book around, flips back a page or two. \nNorman simply stares at the man. Arbogast hums faintly, pleasantly, as he examines the pages. Then: \nARBOGAST Yes sir! Marie Samuels.  Interesting alias. \nHe takes a slip of paper out of his pocket, lays it beside the signature in the registry book, all the while nodding and smiling nicely, as if this discovery will make Norman as happy as it is making him. \nARBOGAST Don't know where she got \"Marie,\" but \"Samuels\" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam. (Turns to Norman, the smile gone) Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again? \nNORMAN I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time. \nArbogast has reached him, the picture extended. Norman looks dutifully at it. \nNORMAN It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess. \nARBOGAST Tell me all about her. \nNORMAN She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early. \nARBOGAST How early? \n", "test1_true": "ARBOGAST Of which morning? \nNORMAN The following morning. Sunday. \nARBOGAST No one met her? \nNORMAN No. \nARBOGAST Or arrived with her. \nNORMAN No. \nARBOGAST She didn't call anyone? Even locally? \nNORMAN No. \nARBOGAST You didn't spend the whole night with her did you? \nNORMAN No! Of all... \nARBOGAST How do you know she didn't make a call? \nNORMAN She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way. \nARBOGAST Back where? \nNORMAN What do you mean? \nARBOGAST You said she was sitting \"back there,\" or standing rather... \nNORMAN Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave. \nARBOGAST How did she pay you? \nNORMAN What? \nARBOGAST Cash or check? For the cabin... \nNORMAN Cash. \nARBOGAST And when she left, she never came back. \nNORMAN Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind... \nARBOGAST I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic! (smiles) This ain't jelling. \nNORMAN I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go... \nARBOGAST She isn't still here, is she? \nNORMAN Not at all! \nARBOGAST Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant? \nNORMAN (as if pleasantly exasperated) Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like. (laughs, shakes his head) Come on. \nHe starts out. Arbogast pauses, momentarily confused by the young man's openness. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE MOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT) \nNorman walks down the porch, hesitates before Cabin One, walks on a bit toward Cabin Two, stops, turns to see if Arbogast is following. Arbogast has come out onto the porch, but is not following. He has walked to the opposite end of the porch and is standing at its edge, looking up at the old house. The upstairs window is in darkness. The neon of the Vacancy and Motel signs splash strange light over the scene. \nNORMAN Change your mind? \nArbogast does not reply. Norman becomes apprehensive, starts to Arbogast, forcing himself to remain calm and cheerful. \nNORMAN I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing. \nARBOGAST (to Norman, but continuing to stare at the house) Anyone at home? \nNORMAN I live there. Alone. \nARBOGAST Someone is sitting in that window. \n", "test1_id": 984, "test2_input": "Lila goes to the door. He holds it open and she goes out. \nEXT. THE MOTEL - (DAY) \nSam closes the door, joins Lila, takes her hand. \nTogether they walk along the porch in the direction of Cabin One. CAMERA FOLLOWS. They pause before the door of Cabin One. Sam motions Lila to wait, to hold still, then goes on to the office, opens the door, calls in: \nSAM Bates? \nHe waits, there is no response. He goes in and in a moment comes back out, closes the door, goes to Lila. \nShe has already opened the door of Cabin One and has started to enter. \nINT. CABIN ONE - (DAY) \nThe blinds are closed and the room is almost night-dark. \nSam comes in after Lila, closes the door behind him. \nFor a moment they just gaze at the room, as if willing it to tell them some satisfactory story. \nNeither speaks. Then, in dark silence, they begin to search, going methodically and thoroughly through all drawers, the closet, the desk, searching under the bed and in dark corners, not knowing what they expect to find and yet expecting to find some thing. Lila opens the bathroom door, looks in. The windowless room is very dark. She switches on the light, goes in. Sam moves toward the bathroom, is about to follow her in when he notices which room it is and automatically catches himself up, backs out. \nSAM Sorry. \nLILA Hospital clean. \nSAM What? \nLILA The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean! \nSam goes in, glances around, nods. Lila goes through the medicine cabinet, finds nothing but a glass and two tiny tabs of soap. Sam leans against the door-jamb, looks at the tub, the shower pipe above it. He continues to stare, more interested suddenly, as if bothered by some off-key evidence he can't put his finger on. Then he looks at the shower curtain rod. \nAnd realizes there is no shower curtain. He frowns, is about to say something when Lila, who has been momentarily out of shot, interrupts. \nSam turns, CAMERA TURNS, and we see Lila is standing above the toilet bowl, a tiny piece of wet paper stuck to the tip of her right index finger. \nSAM What is it? \nLILA It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of. (Extending her finger toward Sam) Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand. \nSam lifts the piece of paper off her finger, studies it, takes out his wallet, presses the wet scrap to his driver's license shield, puts it back in the wallet and puts the wallet away. \nLILA That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to... \nSAM (Reminding) Bates never denied Mary was here. \nLILA (Reminded) Yes. (A thought) But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money. \nSAM Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it? \nLILA Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing! \nShe starts out of the bathroom. Sam takes hold of her arm, stops her. \nSAM You can't go up there. \nLILA Why not? \nSAM Bates. \nCAMERA STARTS TO PAN AWAY from them, moves slowly over the room, very slowly. \nLILA'S VOICE (O.S.) Let's find him. One of us can keep him occupied while the other gets to the woman. \nSAM'S VOICE (O.S.) You won't be able to hold him still if he doesn't want to be held. And I don't like you going into that house alone, Lila. \nCAMERA HAS PANNED clear across to the opposite wall now, and is moving up closer and closer to the tiny-flowered wall paper, finally closing in on one small rosebud. \nLILA'S VOICE (O.S.) I can handle a sick old woman. \nNow we see that the rosebud has been cut out, that this is the reverse side of the hole Norman peeped through to watch Mary. And we see the pupil of Norman's eye now. \nSAM'S VOICE (O.S.) All right. I'll find Bates and keep him occupied. \n", "test2_true": "FRESH ANGLE - LILA AND SAM \nThey are about to start out. Sam stops her again. \nSAM Wait a minute. If you get anything out of the mother... (A thought) Can you find your way back to town? (As Lila nods yes) If you do get anything, don't stop to tell me. \nLila nods quickly, hurries to the door. Sam gets to it first, opens it a slight crack, looks out, then opens it wide enough for Lila and Himself to pass through. \nEXT. THE MOTEL - (DAY) \nANGLE CLOSE on cabin one as Lila comes out, turns to her left, goes along porch toward cabin twelve. Sam remains at the door, then turns right, heading for the path. As he passes the office, he is shocked to see Norman standing just inside the open door. \nNORMAN Looking for me? \nSAM (Recovering) Yes, matter of fact. (The friendly grin) The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk. \nNORMAN Satisfied with your cabin? \nSAM Fine. \nSam starts into the office. Just before going in, he glances down the long porch, sees Lila standing outside the door of cabin twelve, waves her a tiny \"all clear\" signal. \nLILA \nCAMERA ANGLES to include Lila and her point of view. \nShe watches Sam disappear into the office, waits until she hears the door close, then looks about for another way to reach the house. She sees the small alley at the end of this L of cabins, starts toward it. \nEXT. REAR OF MOTEL - S.C.U. LILA - (DAY) \nBehind the motel Lila hesitates. She looks ahead. \nLONG SHOT - (DAY) \nThe old house standing against the sky. \nCLOSE UP - (DAY) \nLila moves forward. \nLONG SHOT - (DAY) \nThe CAMERA approaching the house. \nCLOSE UP - (DAY) \nLila glances toward the back of Norman's parlor. She moves on. \nLONG SHOT - (DAY) \nThe house coming nearer. \nCLOSE UP - (DAY) \nLila looks up at the house. She moves forward purposefully. \nS.L.S. - (DAY) \nThe house and the porch. \nCLOSE UP - (DAY) \nLila stops at the house and looks up. She glances back. \nShe turns to the house again. \nS.L.S. - (DAY) \nThe CAMERA MOUNTS the steps to the porch. \nC.U. - (DAY) \nLila puts out her hand. \nS.C.U. - (DAY) \n", "test2_id": 985, "test3_input": "Lila goes to the chair, touches it. The touch disturbs the figure. It starts to turn, slowly, stiffly, a clock-wise movement. Lila looks at it in horror. It is the body of a woman long dead. The skin is dry and pulled away from the mouth and the teeth are revealed as in the skeleton's smile. The eyes are gone from their sockets, the bridge of the nose has collapsed, the hair is dry and wild, the cheeks are sunken, the leathery-brown skin is powdered and rouged and flaky. The body is dressed in a high-neck, clean, well-pressed dress, obviously recently laundered and hand-ironed. \nThe movement of this stuffed, ill-preserved cadaver, turning as if in response to Lila's call and touch, is actually graceful, ballet-like, and the effect is terrible and obscene. \nLila gazes for one flicker of a deathly moment, then begins to scream, a high, piercing, dreadful scream. \nAnd Lila's scream is joined by another scream, a more dreadful, horrifying scream which comes from the door behind her. \nNORMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) (screaming) Ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Am Norma Bates! \nLila turns. \nNORMAN \nHis face is contorted. He wears a wild wig, a mockery of a woman's hair. He is dressed in a high-neck dress which is similar to that worn by the corpse of his mother. His hand is raised high, poised to strike at Lila. There is a long breadknife in it. \nLILA \nClose on her face. She is dumb-struck. Her eyes are screaming. \nBACK TO NORMAN \nAs he is about to start forward, a man's hand reaches in from the doorway behind, grabs Norman's wrist. Sam comes through the door, still holding tight to the wrist, pulling back the arm and at the same time throwing himself at Norman, football tackle style. \nSERIES OF CUTS - THE FIGHT \nNorman and Sam, struggling. The wild fury in Norman's face, the mad noise of his screams and vile curses. The terrified, fight-to-the-death look of Sam. The still, staring Lila. \nMRS. BATES \nA close of her face, She appears to be watching and enjoying the fight. Over the shot, the SOUNDS of the struggle, the screams of Norman. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. COURTHOUSE AT READING - (NIGHT) \nThere are many people gathered about the steps, the curious and the concerned and the morbid. At the curb, a couple of newspaper cars, two or three police cars, and a mobile unit truck from the local television outlet. There is noise, and chattering as questions are asked and answers given, and the sounds of traffic, and of the television equipment being moved into the courthouse, for on-the-scene reporting, and the stern voices of policemen trying to keep people back. The scene has a bright glare about it, that quality of sudden light thrown on a fearful darkness. \nCLOSER ANGLE ON STEPS OF COURTHOUSE \nA POLICEMAN trying to make way for the television men, muttering \"keep back,\" etc., to the spectators. A TELEVISION MAN, carrying a piece of equipment goes through door, and CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the courthouse vestibule. \nHere, too, there is a crowd, composed of Policemen, Reporters, Television Men. The Television Men we have been following stops beside a Policeman. \nTELEVISION MAN (Indicating the front door he has just come in through) You think they'll take him out that way? \nPOLICEMAN (Looking at waiting crowd, shrugging) Probably have to. (A rueful smile) Besides, the taxpayers hate it when something gets slipped out the back door on them! \nOver this exchange, the buzz of other voices, the movement of men. CAMERA MOVES ON, down the corridor, gets to the door of the office of the Chief of Police just as a young fellow with a carton box filled with paper containers of sent-out- for coffee reaches this door. CAMERA HOLDS as the COFFEE BOY pauses a moment, then goes into the room. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE - (NIGHT) \nLila is seated in a chair, Sam standing close by. A bit apart from them, we see Sheriff Chambers, in quiet conference with the CHIEF OF POLICE, the COUNTY SHERIFF, the DISTRICT ATTORNEY. \nThe Coffee Boy stands in the doorway. Sam goes to him, takes a container of coffee from the box, carries it to Lila, checking the notation on the lid as he goes. \nMED. CLOSE ON SAM AND LILA \nSAM (quietly) It's regular. Okay? \nLILA (ruefully) I could stand something regular. \nSam smiles encouragingly, hands her the coffee. Sheriff Chambers ENTERS SHOT, gives Sam a container of coffee he has brought for him. Sam takes it, nods a thank you. \nFor a moment no one speaks. Lila looks badly shaken, Sam disheveled, but contained. \nCHAMBERS You two can go on home if you like. (a sympathetic look at Lila) Making that statement was enough for one night. \nSAM (to Lila) Want to? \nLILA No. I'm all right. I'll feel better when all this is explained... if it can be. \nSam looks a question at Sheriff Chambers. Chambers shrugs doubtfully. \n", "test3_true": "Lila is about to answer, when she sees someone come into the room and rises anxiously. Sam and Sheriff Chambers turn, follow her gaze. \nINT. OFFICE OF CHIEF OF POLICE - FULL SHOT \nA young man with a serious, frowning face has just come into the room. He is DR. SIMON, the Psychiatrist. \nHe goes to the desk where the box of coffee containers has been placed, takes up a container. \nDISTRICT ATTORNEY Did he talk to you? \nSIMON No. I got the whole story... but not from Norman. I got it from... his mother. \nEveryone gazes at him, mystified. He speaks as he removes lid from coffee container. \nSIMON Norman Bates no longer exists. He only half-existed to begin with... now, the other half has taken over. Probably for all time. \nLILA (With difficulty) Did he kill my sister? \nSIMON Yes... and no. \nDISTRICT ATTORNEY Look, if you're trying to lay a lot of psychiatric groundwork for some sort of plea this fellow would like to cop... \nSIMON A psychiatrist doesn't lay the groundwork .. he merely tries to explain it. \nLILA But my sister is... \nSIMON Yes. I'm sorry. (to Chambers) The Private Investigator, too. If you drag that swamp somewhere in the vicinity of the motel... (To the Chief of Police) Have you any unsolved missing persons cases on your books? \nCHIEF OF POLICE Yes. Two. \nSIMON Young girls? \nCHIEF OF POLICE (nods, astounded, then:) Did he confess to... \nSIMON (interrupting) As I said, the mother... (Pauses, goes on afresh) To understand it, as I understood it hearing it from the mother...  That is, from the mother-half of Norman's mind, you have to go back ten years... to the time when Norman murdered his mother and her lover. (A pause, then as no one interrupts) He was already dangerously disturbed, had been ever since his father died. His mother was a clinging, demanding woman... and for years the two of them lived as if there was no one else in the world. Then she met a man and it seemed to Norman she \"threw him over\" for this man. That pushed him over the thin line... and he killed them both. Matricide is probably the most unbearable crime of all... and most unbearable to the son who commit it. So he had to erase the crime, at least in his own mind. (A pause) He stole her corpse... and a weighted coffin was buried. He hid the body in the fruit cellar, even \"treated\" it to keep it as well as it would keep. And that still wasn't enough. She was there, but she was a corpse. So he began to think and speak for her, gave her half his life, so to speak. At times he could be both personalities, carry on conversations... at other times, the mother-half took over completely. He was never all Norman, but he was often only mother. And because he was so pathologically jealous of her, he assumed she was as jealous of him. Therefore, if he felt a strong attraction to any other woman, the mother side of him would go wild. (To Lila) When Norman met your sister, he was touched by her... and aroused by her. He wanted her. And this set off his \"jealous mother\" and...  \"mother killed the girl.\" After the murder, Norman returned as if from a deep sleep... and like a dutiful son, covered up all traces of the crime he was convinced his mother had committed. \nSAM Why was he... dressed like that? \nDISTRICT ATTORNEY He's a transvestite! \nSIMON Not exactly. A man who dresses in woman's clothing in order to achieve a sexual change... or satisfaction... is a transvestite.  But in Norman's case, he was simply doing everything possible to keep alive the illusion of his mother being alive. And whenever reality came too close, when danger or desire threatened that illusion, he'd dress up, even to a cheap wig he brought, and he'd walk about the house, sit in her chair, speak in her voice... He tried to be his mother. (A sad smile) And now he is. (A pause) That's what I meant when I said I got the story from the mother. She thinks Norman has been taken away... because of his crimes.  She insists she did nothing, that Norman committed all the murders just to keep her from being discovered. She even smiled a bit coquettishly as she said that. Of course, she feels badly about it... but also somewhat relieved to be, as she put it, free of Norman, at last. (A pause) When the mind houses two personalities, there is always a battle. In Norman's case, the battle is over... and the dominant personality has won. \nLila begins to weep softly, for Mary, for Arbogast, for Norman, for all the destroyed human beings of this world. Sam bends beside her, puts his arm about her, comforts her. \nCHAMBERS (To Simon) And the forty thousand dollars?  Who got that? \nSIMON The swamp. These were murders of passion, not profit. \nA POLICE GUARD puts his head in the door, speaks, in a near- whisper, to the Chief of Police. The Guard is carrying a folded blanket over his arm. \nPOLICE GUARD He feels a little chill... can I bring him this blanket? \nThe Chief of Police nods. The Guard goes away, and CAMERA FOLLOWS him out of the room and out into the hallway. Guard moves through the waiting men, heading down the corridor. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR IN COURTHOUSE \nA narrower corridor in the rear of the building. In f.g. of shot, we see a door, the top half of which is wire-covered glass. A GUARD in uniform is posted by the door, looking reprovingly at the two or three people trying to get a glance into the room. \nThe Police Guard, carrying the blanket, comes down this corridor, goes to the door. CAMERA MOVES CLOSE. The uniformed Guard opens the door, allows the man to go in. \nShot is RAKED so that we can not see into the room. \nAfter a moment, the Guard comes out and the uniformed Guard closes and locks the door and we \nCUT TO: \nINT. NORMAN'S DETENTION ROOM - (NIGHT) \nThe walls are white and plain. There is no window. \nThere is no furniture except the straight-back chair in which Norman sits, in the center of the room. The room has a quality of no-whereness, of calm separation from the world. \nThe Police Guard has placed the blanket on Norman's knees. Norman, as we come upon him, is lifting the blanket, unfolding it. His face, although without makeup and without the surrounding softness of the wig, has a certain femininity about it, a softness about the mouth and a kind of arch womanliness about the brows. \n", "test3_id": 986}

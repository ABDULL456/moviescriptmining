CUT TO: 
EXT. CONCORD - DAY 
Wade's Ford pickup passes J. Battle Hand's office, keeps going. Grass peeks through the snow at this lower altitude. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LILLIAN'S HOUSE - DAY 
Wade parks the truck, walks past leafless bushes to a charcoal- gray split-level with pink shutters. He pushes the door bell; the first notes of "Frere Jacques" play. 
Lillian opens the door; Jill's footsteps approach. 
LILLIAN Wait there. She'll be right out. (looks back) Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford? 
WADE Yeah, lots. 
LILLIAN (to Jill) See. Get your boots. 
WADE Hi honey. 
JILL (going back inside) Hi. 
LILLIAN Have her back tomorrow night by six. 
WADE No problem. Look, I... 
LILLIAN You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low. 
WADE Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter? 
LILLIAN You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it. 
Jill returns, wearing parka and boots, heads out with her father. 
LILLIAN Bye, honey! Call me tonight if you want. 
Wade and Jill approach the truck. 
JILL Are we going in this? 
WADE Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine. 
JILL It's pretty old. 
WADE It belongs to Pop. 
JILL Pop? 
WADE Grandpa. My father. It's his. 
JILL Oh. 
Wade opens the truck door. Jill climbs in with her overnight bag, looks back to the door where Lillian watches.

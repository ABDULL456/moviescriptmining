The celebration is quieter and drunker now. 
LAMONT (a couple of beers 
ALONG) We are the good guys! 
ROSSI LAMONT Six down, fifty to go. Call the Times, nail it to the fucking door. The CIA are the good guys. 
MALINOV The Canadians are the good guys. 
LAMONT -- we're not greedy -- them too -- 
MALINOV Only. Canada takes the credit, or they'll retaliate against the hostages. Great Satan wasn't involved. No CIA. 
LAMONT Is that right, Jack? 
O'DONNELL Involved in what? We're as surprised as anybody. Thank you, Canada. Jack raises a glass of Scotch and takes a drink.

ARGO - Final 118. 
330 EXT. BY LESTER'S POOL - DAY 330 
Siegel in a bathrobe, looking out over L.A., holding The New York Times in front of him: SIX U.S. DIPLOMATS, HIDDEN BY CANADA, LEAVE IRAN SAFELY. Next to that, an article about Ken Taylor: DIPLOMAT DIRECTED ESCAPE IN IRAN. (Front page, NYT 1/30/80.) 
SIEGEL She said, Why couldn't we pull off something like that?' You know what I said to her? 
331 INT. CIA (LANGLEY) - THE PIT - DAY 331 
Mendez stands at a desk on the main floor. 
MENDEZ Wha'd you say to her? 
332 EXT. BY LESTER'S POOL - DAY 332 
SIEGEL I said, Argo fuck yourself.' 
333 INT. CIA ARCHIVES - DAY 333 
And suddenly it's dead-quiet. We're in a vault inside a vault in the basement of the main building. Mendez's suitcase is laying on a low counter, an ARCHIVES OFFICER t-tagging and cataloging various items. Separating Mendez's personal things from material related to the operation. Mendez empties his briefcase and the officer puts a sticker on the VARIETY featuring the ARGO ad. Another on the ARGO script. He's putting things into a box that reads: USCIA CLASSIFIED MATERIAL. Mendez opens his accordion folder -- flips through it -- it's empty -- no. There's something inside. In one of the compartments is a STORYBOARD FROM ARGO. One that the Komiteh missed. While the Archives Officer is turned around, Mendez slips the storyboard back into the accordion folder and puts it back with his personal things. 
ARGO - Final 119. 
334 EXT. CIA - FRONT PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON 334 
O'Donnell is on his way out, heading toward Tony who is heading in. Seeing Mendez, he stops dead. 
O'DONNELL And I left my autograph book at home. His Eminence called me. He wants to see you. 
MENDEZ He wants to fire me himself. 
O'DONNELL He wants to give you the Intelligence Star. You're getting the highest award of merit of the Clandestine Services of these United States. Ceremony's two weeks from today. Mendez stops walking. A beat. 
MENDEZ If they push it a week, I can bring Ian. That's his winter break. 
O'DONNELL The op was classified so the ceremony's classified. He can't know about it. Nobody can know about it. 
MENDEZ They're gonna hand me an award, then they're gonna take it back? 
O'DONNELL If we wanted applause, we would have joined the circus. 
MENDEZ I thought we did. O'Donnell claps Tony on the shoulder. Tony walks towards the entrance and Jack heads to his car.

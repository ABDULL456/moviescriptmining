JACK As likely as not. (calling) Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship! 
EXT. DAUNTLESS - STERN - MORNING 
Sailors make their way down a rope ladder, crowd onto the Jolly Mon. Will pushes hard against the windlass, to no avail ... the anchor is too heavy for one man. Jack notices. 
JACK A little help? 
Gillette shrugs, gestures to Murtogg and Mullroy. The three men throw their weight into the windlass, and it turns. Jack's pistol is on them the whole time. 
MURTOGG I can't believe he's doing this. 
The windless turns, bringing Mullroy into view. 
MULLROY You didn't believe he was telling the truth, either. 
The windless turns some more, and there's Gillette. 
GILLETTE (over his shoulder, to Will) Do you have any idea, boy, what you're doing? 
Another quarter turn - 
WILL No. 
EXT. DAUNTLESS - FORECASTLE - DAY 
Jack and Will crank a capstan, raising the forward jib sail. It luffs and billows out. The huge ship inches forward slowly, pulled by just the one sail. Jack grins. 
JACK Lookee there, mate! We're underway! 
EXT. PORT ROYAL - DOCK - DAY 
Norrington moves along, concentrating on a manifest. Alongside him is governor Swann, who glances over - 
Sees the tiny Jolly Mon headed toward them, riding low in the water, overloaded with sailors. Beyond that, the Dauntless sails -- albeit slowly -- for open waters. 
SWANN Commodore -- 
NORRINGTON A moment. 
SWANN But -- 
NORRINGTON Please. 
SWANN Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship! 
Norrington glances out at the bay. Sure enough, the Dauntless is on the move. Norrington takes a brass telescope from his belt, opens it, trains it on -- 
The main deck. He picks out Will - 
NORRINGTON Rash, Turner, too rash. 
-- then spots Jack, at the wheel. Lowers the telescope. 
NORRINGTON (CONT'D) That is, without doubt, the worst pirate I have ever seen. 
EXT. H . M. S. DAUNTLESS - DAY 
Out in the open sea, Jack leans on the wheel, relaxed; not much sailing to do with a following wind. Will looks back - 
WILL They're coming! 
He points: the sails of the Interceptor fill out, and the ship cuts through the water toward them- 
EXT. H.M.S. INTERCEPTOR - DAY 
Norrington's smaller ship quickly comes alongside the slowmoving Dauntless. Its decks appear empty. Grappling hooks are thrown, and sailors draw the two ships together. 
Norrington's men swarm across. 
NORRINGTON Search every cabin, every hold, down to the bilges! 
PULL BACK, away from the   Dauntless, and past the railing of the Interceptor, where a   single SENTRY stands watch -- and we find a soaked Jack and   Will as they climb up over the side of the smaller ship,   unseen. 
Jack tackles the Sentry from behind, covers hi1rmouth. 
JACK Can you swim? (the man struggles) Can. You. Swim? 
Jack removes his hand. 
SENTRY Of course, sir. Like a fish. I grew up summers living in Dover, with my uncle - 
JACK Good. 
Jack lifts the man up, throws him overboard. Quickly unties the ropes to the grappling hooks. Will cranks the capstan bars, raising the foresail - 
EXT. H . M. S. DAUNTLESS - DAY 
Norrington emerges from a gangway -- and sees his other ship moving away. 
NORRINGTON Sailors! Back to the Interceptor!

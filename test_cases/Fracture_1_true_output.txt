INT. WILLY'S APARTMENT - A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER 
The garage door is open, letting in daylight. We can see the alley especially well, because there are only empty hangers on the clothes-bar, and the cinderblock shelves have been taken apart, stacked on the floor. Willy is packing.    He's wearing jeans, an old t-shirt. He carries a heavy pile of legal textbooks out to the trash bins, throws them away. 
As he turns to go back in - he sees Lobruto coming along the alley, wearing a suit. Surprised, waits. 
LOBRUTO You're not answering your phone. Beat. 
WILLY That's kind of an answer in itself, isn't it? Willy heads back in, starts to pack again. 
LOBRUTO Where are you headed? 
WILLY Haven't decided yet.    Just someplace else. Lobruto nods.   Willy packs. 
LOBRUTO I shouldn't have let it get so far out of control. (Beat) We all lose, Willy. 
WILLY Yep. 
LOBRUTO We just have to live with that, and keep fighting the good fight. 
WILLY That's not what I was doing. 
LOBRUTO You belong in a courtroom. Willy packs, thinking about that.   Shakes his head. 
WILLY I need to - get to know myself better. 
LOBRUTO You're a good lawyer. All this may have even made you a better lawyer. Don't waste it. Willy turns on him - angry, confused, bitter: 
WILLY I didn't just lose a case!     I let a man get away with murder. Lobruto nods. Respecting his pain.     Shrugs, accepts the decision, with regret. Willy nods his thanks, and turns back to packing. Lobruto starts to leave.    But from the alley door: 
LOBRUTO If it makes you feel any better - technically, you let a man get away with attempted murder. Willy doesn't respond.    Keeps packing. Lobruto goes out. After a moment, Willy stops.    Looking up.   Something turning over in his mind. 
EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 
Lobruto is walking toward his car when Willy steps out of the garage and calls after him: 
WILLY His wife is dead! Lobruto turns.   Uncertain what Willy is getting at. 
WILLY We can still get him.    We can take him back to court. 
LOBRUTO (Gently) Willy... Willy comes toward him - excited, insistent: 
WILLY Double jeopardy doesn't apply! We bring a new charge - of homicide. 
LOBRUTO Willy - what happened to you, on the helicopter - we don't even know if we could prove - 
WILLY No: he shot her and she died. The fact that it took time - the fact that he went to trial in between, just for shooting her - doesn't matter. He fired a gun and caused her death, and that's murder. (Beat) If he can twist the law around - then so can we. Lobruto thinks it out.    Wary. 
LOBRUTO A second indictment on the same incident? 
WILLY A man burns down a house; we charge him with arson. There were people sleeping upstairs - and after weeks in the hospital, they die. We'd charge him with murder. Right? Lobruto nods. On the fence, but seeing it now.         Impressed with the young man's fervor, and his logic. But he shakes his head. 
LOBRUTO All your evidence is still toxic.      The confession, the arrest - it's all still inadmissible. Willy grimaces.    Looks down.    Thinking, intense. 
LOBRUTO I'm sorry, Willy. It was a good idea, but - 
WILLY I'll get something new. 
LOBRUTO How? Willy looks up at him.    Calm now.

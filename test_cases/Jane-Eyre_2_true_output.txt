A form emerges, a woman, tall and gaunt, with thick, black hair hanging down her back. She is dressed in a nightgown - like a shroud. Over her head, she wears Jane's bridal veil; a phantom bride. 
Jane is paralysed with terror. 
The form takes the veil and slowly tears it in half; bruised arms, dirt, predatory nails, neglect. The last thing to be revealed is the woman's face, pale and ghastly. Her eyes are glittering with hatred. 
The figure takes the candle and bends down to Jane. Her intention looks deadly. Jane's breath catches. She cannot breathe. 
The figure moves closer, then blows out the candle. Darkness. 
INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM. 
Jane wakes, lying half out of the bed. The veil is over her. She flings it away from her face. Jane sits, her terror dawning. Her breath comes in great dry sobs. She is shocked to find herself still alive. 
EXT. EVENING. - THORNFIELD - BY THE GATES 
Jane is waiting, pale with anxiety. A man on horseback approaches, a great dog at his side; Rochester. He is grinning. 
He pulls Jane up on the horse in front of him. She curls into his arms, desperate for his comfort and his strength. Rochester senses something is wrong. He slows the horse. 
ROCHESTER What is it? 
JANE I'm afraid. 
INT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM. 
Rochester holds the torn veil in his hands. He is aghast. He cannot think what to say. 
ROCHESTER Jane, this is the only explanation. It must have been half-dream, half- reality. A woman did enter your room last night and that woman was - must have been - Grace Poole - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 88. 
JANE It was not Grace Poole. 
Rochester keeps talking over her. 
ROCHESTER You know how strange she is. What did she do to me? To Mason? In a state between sleeping and waking - 
JANE I was not asleep. 
ROCHESTER You noticed her entrance and her actions but you've ascribed to her an appearance different from her own. That was your nightmare - 
JANE I know what I saw. 
ROCHESTER I see you'd ask why I keep such a woman in my house. When we've been married a year and a day, I promise I'll tell you. Are you satisfied Jane? Do you accept my solution? 
Jane clearly doesn't. Rochester takes her in his arms. 
ROCHESTER (CONT'D) Dear God. It was only the veil... 
INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - ADELE'S ROOM. 
Jane is in an unadorned pearl wedding gown. 
ADELE Mademoiselle... 
Adele gives her a small bouquet. Jane hugs her, very moved - as if she is leaving her childhood behind. She turns to go. 
SOPHIE Please, you must look. 
Jane gazes stupefied at the stranger in the mirror. 
INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE HALL. 
Rochester is waiting at the bottom of the stairs for Jane. She slows when she sees him. She finds she cannot speak. Neither can he. 
Mrs Fairfax is by the door. Jane can't find words for her. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 89. 
ROCHESTER Come. 
Rochester grips her hand. They quit the house. 
EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 
Rochester, grimly resolute, is striding at a pace Jane can hardly follow. Her satin shoes are muddy. She is becoming breathless. A rook flies over their heads, cawing. 
EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE CHURCH. 
Rochester is striding purposefully towards a small church of ancient design. Jane stumbles. Rochester is contrite. 
Jane tries to collect herself. She looks up to the sky. The rook wheels around the spire. She takes Rochester's hand. 
INT. DAY. THE CHURCH 
At the altar, Jane glances at Rochester. He is looking straight ahead at the clergyman, Wood. 
WOOD I require and charge you both, as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgement when the secrets of all hearts shall be revealed, that if either of you know any impediment why ye may not be lawfully joined together in matrimony, ye do now confess it. 
There is not a sound. Rochester still doesn't look at Jane. The clergyman prepares the rings. 
WOOD (CONT'D) Edward Fairfax Rochester, do you TAKE - 
A commotion at the back of the church. Two men rapidly enter. One of them Briggs, hurries up the aisle.

THE LEDGER is a payroll account.  Names upon names of workers rendered in sepia by Crain's severe cursive.  Notations in the column beside it indicate man, woman, or child and the appropriate wage for each class of worker.  Many of them, at least a third, are children. 
NELL reacts.  Disturbed by it.  She shifts closer to that damn chair behind her.  The sheet hangs over it in such a way that someone could be sitting there under it. 
She turns the page.  Columns indicate pay, and so on.  But one column, at the very center of the book, hidden in the binding, is unlabeled. Down the column, some names have a line drawn through them, and at the end of the line, a CROSS. 
Nell follows them back, eyes searching across the ledger. 
She turns the page, pushes the book down revealing that concealed column, more crosses.  And more.  Her eyes flick back and forth. The crosses are paired with entries for CHILD.  She looks their names... 
NELL (cont'd) Erin, Peter and Sean and Emily and Elizabeth... who are you?  And you?  What happened to you?  You died... How did you die? 
Nell turns the pages.  More and more crosses.  Dozens.  Scores. 
Nell sinks down into Crain's chair and tears come to her eyes.  We see the book. 
INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT 
The painting is right there now.  The letters have been erased. 
INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT 
We see the ledger, and pull back, and the ledger is in Nell's lap. Nell sits on the bed in her sleeping tee-shirt and undies.  Theo looks at the book with her. 
THEO That's so sad. 
NELL There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said. 
THEO Before he painted your name over Mister Crain. 
Theo hands her the bottle.  Nell takes it, tops off her glass, spilling.  Her face is red.  She grimaces as she tosses back a big swallow. 
NELL You really think it was Luke? 
Theo takes another swig.  She holds bottles of nail polish up next to Nell's bare feet, testing the colors. 
THEO Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and... (beat) You said the Good Doctor was with you. 
NELL (pondering) I don't know what to think anymore. 
THEO Just think about one thing right now: What color? 
Nell finally puts the book down and takes a drink. 
NELL I've never had a pedicure before. 
THEO Well? 
NELL Red. (into this now) What else? 
Theo smiles and takes Nell's foot gently in her hand.  She begins to paint her toenails. 
THEO (cont'd) See, isn't this better than a hit on the head? 
Nell looks down her long legs at Theo. 
NELL I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo. 
THEO Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch. 
Nell shoots down the rest of the glass of wine. 
NELL I'll take that as a compliment. (beat, trying to sound casual) In the city, what kind of place do you live in? 
THEO I have a loft. 
Nell is thrilled with this. 
NELL A loft.  That's a lot of room for one person.  Probably.  Maybe there's room for... 
Theo looks up, understands what she's asking. 
THEO You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me? 
NELL I don't know, you know... 
Nell lies back, arms spread, lets the glass roll out of her hand. Theo paints Nell's toenails one by one, carefully guiding the brush strokes in along the skin.  Nell, unused to this, gives into the pleasure, and Theo sees how easy it is to move Nell. 
THEO My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean? 
NELL I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things. 
Theo looks up at her, unreadable. 
THEO All the time. 
Nell lets out a sigh.  Gently Theo's hand moves down the arch of Nell's foot.  Caressing.  Nell lets her.

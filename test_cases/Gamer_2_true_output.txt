VRUUUUUM, VRUUUM... KABLE hammers on the pedal again, knocking out the old ghosts - VRROOOOOOMM!! 
He SLAMS it into gear and PEELS OUT. 
HACKMAN leaps onto the side of the moving truck and points 50mm directly at the side of KABLE'S head. In a split instant KABLE grabs the nose of the weapon and points it up - 
BOOM! A close range shell blows through the roof of the truck. KABLE slams the brakes, spinning the truck, and launches HACKMAN into a row of parked cars. 
HACKMAN gets in one last shot as KABLE punches it out of the garage, disintegrating a concrete column. 
HACKMAN Fuuuuck!!!! 
He slams his head into the windshield of a parked car, caving it in. 
94   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4/F250 (DRIVING) - MOMENTS LATER      94 
KABLE DRIFTS the F-250 onto the street, sideways, tires shrieking... wiping out two unlucky BLUES... pops it and TAKES OFF... 
He is headed STRAIGHT INTO THE RESTRICTED AREA. 
95   INT/EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4/F250 (DRIVING)                  95 
The FLY CAM is right there, taking the hot turn right on the truck's tail, giving SIMON the POV of a classic 3D DRIVING GAME. He activates DYNAMIC CAMERA CONTROL with a gesture - now he can manually choose his view... he pushes the CAMERA forward, next to the driver's window... 
The CAMERA looks to the side at KABLE, driving like he's on a mission to HELL. SIMON barks in his head. 
SIMON (O.S.) Kable, PLEASE... get back in the game! YOU'RE SCREWING MY ASS, KABLE!!! 
KABLE ignores him; he picks up his WEAPON, points it out the window at the FLY and FIRES... the FLY jukes out of the way, barely... it spins off OUT OF CONTROL and SMASHES through the window of a building. Bye, FLY.

96    INT. SIMON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                  96 
SIMON'S screen is filled with a GLITCHED OUT view of NOTHING, under a pile of glass and concrete. 
SIMON Um. 
97    EXT. SLAYERS RESTRICTED AREA - CONTINUOUS                       97 
The SUBMARINE ALARM is sounding across the BATTLEGROUND. KABLE is heading deep into RESTRICTED TERRITORY, slamming through and swerving around obstacles. 
98    INT/EXT. RESTRICTED AREA/F250 (DRIVING)                         98 
WITHOUT WARNING: a SNOWPLOW comes blasting out of nowhere going 80, trying to ram the driver's side... it's a tick late, clipping the back end instead, sending KABLE into a SPIN... KABLE is knocked around in the cab and PUKES all over the passenger seat. He recovers, straightens out and keeps going. 
KABLE (relieved) Ughh, that was the one. 
99    INT. SIMON'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS                                99 
SIMON is switching from CAMERA to CAMERA, trying to pick up a view of KABLE... finally he comes across a RUMBLING CHASE CAM, coming up on KABLE'S truck from behind... 
100   EXT. RESTRICTED AREA/F250 (DRIVING) - SIMULTANEOUS              100 
The CAMERA is mounted on a SNOWPLOW, one of a pair gaining on KABLE, slamming through rubble and debris. 
101   INT. RESTRICTED AREA/F250 (DRIVING)                             101 
KABLE spots them in the REAR VIEW MIRROR. 
He SLAMS HIS HEAD against the steering wheel to clear it - despite the purge he's still pretty FUCKED UP. 
KABLE pops the driver's door and leans out, GETTING A BEAD on the nearest PLOW... 
102   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                  102 
From the SNOWPLOW'S POV we see KABLE leaning out, POINTING THE WEAPON AT US. Then big ass MUZZLE FLASHES: THOOM! THOOM!

SIMON Shit, shit, SHIT! 
A shell comes RIGHT AT US - the screen GLITCHES, FREEZES - and goes BLACK. 
SIMON (cont'd) I'm dead. 
103   EXT. RESTRICTED AREA/F250 (DRIVING) - CONTINUOUS                        103 
In KABLE'S REAR VIEW: The LEAD SNOWPLOW SPINS OUT, hemorrhaging black smoke; then SLAMS into the SECOND, sending it into the side of a building. 
104   INT. F250                                                               104

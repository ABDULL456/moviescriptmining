SOUTH DAKOTAN FARM - DAY \nA lone farmhouse sits isolated against a prairie backdrop, silhouetted by a marbled dawn sky. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - DAY \nMARIAN PETERSON, a gray-haired woman in her late sixties, meticulously packs a suitcase.  She picks up a small, framed PHOTO from a chest-of-drawers and holds it up to her. \nINSERT - PHOTO \nIt's a picture of a man about Marian's age.  He has a sweet natured smile on his face.  Marian looks at it longingly, then packs it carefully in her suitcase between some sweaters and closes it up. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY \nA paint-chipped truck rounds the corner on a dirt road leading into the farm. \nMarian, waiting on the porch, ready to go, rises and waves. \nA FEW MOMENTS LATER - \nMARIAN I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute. \nMarian fumbles with a piece of paper she's rooted out of her purse. \nMischa, annoyed, slams the shift lever into Drive and lurches off. \nMarian leans forward into the rectangular opening of the Plexiglas partition. \nMARIAN I want to go to 526 East 5TH.  That's in the East Village.  My daughter said it would cost thirty dollars. \nIn the REAR-VIEW MIRROR we glimpse Mischa giving Marian a sly look. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LOCATION - DAY \nThe TAXI passes on a turnpike, streaming with vehicles, headed toward Manhattan.  DRIVE-BY TRANSITION. \nINT. TAXI - DAY \nHurtling along.  Marian cranes her head through the partition and attempts to strike up a conversation with the surly cabbie. \nMARIAN I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter. \nMISCHA And where is she? \nlooking out the window, her face clouded with consternation. \nEXT. BRIDGE - DAY \nCars pouring into Manhattan over one of the many bridges spanning the East River. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. EAST 5TH STREET AND 2ND AVENUE - DAY \nThe cab brakes to a halt, bringing Marian INTO THE FRAME, her face strickened with fear. \nMarian climbs out of the cab as Mischa, in the background, opens the trunk to retrieve her bag.  Marian, taking in the foreign surroundings, seems confused about something. \nMARIAN Pardon me, Mischa.  Is this 526 East 5TH Street? \nMischa closes the trunk and approaches Marian with her one piece of luggage on a tote. \nMISCHA No, no.  Sorry, I can't drive you to door.  There's a roadblock on Avenue B (he gestures down the street) right there ... \nMARIAN'S AND MISCHA'S P.O.V. - \nAt the far end of the block, we SEE a movable, blue NYPD roadblock. \nBACK - \nMischa climbs back into his cab and peels off. \nNEW ANGLE - \nHIGH DOWN WIDE of Marian standing forlornly at the end of the street, a Dayton's shopping bag in one hand, her luggage strapped to the tote in the other. \nTITLE IS SUPERIMPOSED: \nMY MOTHER DREAMS THE SATAN'S DISCIPLES IN NEW YORK \nCUT TO: \nEXT. EAST 5TH STREET - DAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nMarian pulling her luggage apprehensively down the street. \nShe passes THE SQUATTERS, a motley group of homeless teenagers, pierced, tattooed, wild hairdos and even wilder attire. \nSQUATTER #1 Hey, lady, can you help us out with some change today? \nMarian, shocked by their circumstances, rolls her luggage past them, smiling faintly. \nSQUATTER #2 Come on.  Every little bit helps.  A little food, you know? \nMARIAN Maybe some other time. \nMarian removes her glasses and fixes her gaze on her daughter. \nMARIAN I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...? \nPAULA Uh-huh? \nMARIAN ... What are they all doing there? \nPAULA That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters. \nMARIAN (alarmed) The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls? \nPAULA I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village. (lays a reassuring hand on her mother's arm) I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CO-OP - NIGHT \nCRANE UP to Marian lying wide awake on a convertible sofa next to the street window.  We (Marian!) hear VOICES, MOTORCYCLES REVVING, POLICE SIRENS, followed by what sounds like GUNFIRE, tires SCREECHING, a cacophony of sounds typical of summer nights in the East Village. \nWe go UP and OVER Marian toward the window as imaginary voices flood in and become intelligible. \nRANDOM VOICES (O.S.) Did that shipment of heroin come in? That old lady see them? We can kill her if we have to. \nRAUCOUS LAUGHTER erupts. \nEXT. CO-OP BUILDING - DAY \nESTABLISHING SHOT of Paula's red-brick co-op, splashed with sunlight and framed by a bright blue sky. \nINT. CO-OP - DAY \nIt's quiet in the co-op.  Marian is dusting the bookshelves and humming to herself. \nBehind a shelf of books she discovers a PHOTO ENVELOPE with some snapshots in them.  Curious, she has a look-see. \nSNAPSHOTS - \nflipping through Marian's hands.  They chronicle Paula and a BOYFRIEND on a recent vacation to a Caribbean island.  Marian is amused by them ... until she comes to one showing Paula with her bathing suit top off, arms raised giddily in the air. \nMARIAN - \ngasps, then blushes and quickly replaces the pictures. \nINT. CO-OP - DAY - LATER \nMarian is at the window, peering through the furling curtains. \nEXT. STREET - DAY - MARIAN'S P.O.V. - \nLooking down on the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse.  Two BIKERS and their GIRLFRIENDS swagger out of the clubhouse, don their helmets, mount their bikes, kick-start them to life and roar off down the street. \nEXT. EAST 5TH STREET - NIGHT \nMarian and Paula, arm-in-arm, walk down the block back to her building. \nA MOTORCYCLE rounds the corner, slows to a crawl, and one of the Satan's Disciples stares over at the two of them as if casing them out.  Paula won't look at him, but Marian can't avert her gaze. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CO-OP - NIGHT \nMarian lying awake in bed, the ENGINES of the Disciples' Harleys deafening ... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SATAN'S DISCIPLES' CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT \nDOLLY ACROSS a line of idling Harleys, the bikers, one at a time in succession, switching their single-beam headlights on. \nPAN ACROSS the FACES of the Disciples, mounted on their cycles, dark helmets, faded blue jeans jackets embroidered with elaborate stitching of their club's insignia, cigarettes dangling from their hirsute mouths, baleful-looking countenances, revving their engines loudly, tauntingly. \nNEW ANGLE - \nFrom across the street, Marian, appearing like an apparition in her nightgown, surreally walks toward them, a beseeching look on her face. \nMARIAN Excuse me.  Could you please turn your motorcycles off?  They're so loud, I can't sleep. \nMarian, not wanting to be a disappointment to her daughter, damn her fears, gathers her purse up and starts out the door. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nMarian is again prevented from an easy exit when a young, hip looking COUPLE come bounding down the stairs.  As she stands at her open door to let them pass, they completely ignore her as if she didn't exist. \nEXT. EAST 5TH STREET - DAY - A FEW MOMENTS LATER \nSeen from Marian's perspective across the street, the front of the Satan's Disciples headquarters is quiet.  There are only a couple Harleys parked out front. \nMarian, relieved that there are no bikers out, hurries off in the direction of First Avenue, determined to see the sights of the city. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY - MONTAGE \nA giddy, almost dreamlike, MONTAGE of Marian touring New York.  She's SUPERIMPOSED over famous landmarks, as if she were standing stationery and the city were in a diorama rotating all around her.  The Empire State Building; Circle Cruise Line; eating a hot dog from a street vendor; shopping at Macy's.  Marian beams as she is magically whisked along, walking on air. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. EAST 5TH STREET - DAY \nMarian comes INTO THE FRAME around the corner.  She has a spring in her step and a broad smile emblazoning her face. But her sanguine mood is quickly shattered when she HEARS shouting.  She freezes in her tracks. \nACROSS THE STREET - THE SATAN'S DISCIPLES HEADQUARTERS - \nMARIAN My daughter lives here and I'm her mother and I've lost my keys. \nThere's no answer. \nMARIAN Hello?  Hello? \nMarian returns her frightened gaze to the altercation across the street. \nACROSS THE STREET - MARIAN'S P.O.V. \nTwo more DISCIPLES emerge from the clubhouse.  One of them squirts lighter fluid on the fire burning in the steel drum and the flames explode.  Then KID is dragged over toward the fire.  The Disciple Prospect drags him dangerously close to the flames. \nDISCIPLE Roast him! \nKID (screaming) All right all right all right. \nMARIAN - \npetrified, as if she'd stepped into a re-enactment of a passage out of Revelations, walks briskly down to the middle of the block toward a pay phone. \nDISCIPLES CLUBHOUSE - \nThe Disciples kick the drug-dealing Teenager a couple more times, then set him free, laughing as he flees down the block in mortal fear. \nPAY PHONE - \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Hello. \nDISCIPLE PROSPECT Washing machine repairman. \nThe DOOR BUZZES almost at once, and the Disciple Prospect pushes it in and holds it open until Marian is safely inside. He looks at her a little annoyed.  Marian is absolutely nonplussed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CO-OP HALLWAY - LATER THAT DAY \nPaula comes running up the stairs.  She stops when she SEES: \nMARIAN - \nsitting on the floor, propped against the door to their unit. \nPaula shakes her head reprovingly at her mother who just shrugs, chagrined. \nINT. CO-OP - BATHROOM - NIGHT - LATER \nPaula is in the bathroom.  She has her mother's vial of Valium in her hand. \nPAULA Maybe you should lay low tomorrow.  I'm going to see if I can get off early and maybe we can take the ferry cruise. Okay? \nLIVING ROOM - \nLooking through the security eyepiece, a FISH-EYE LENS SHOT of an attractive, but distraught woman in her twenties, puffing a cigarette, eyes red and swollen from crying. \nMARIAN Who is it? \nMARIKA It's Marika.  Is Paula there? \nMARIAN She's at work.  I'm her mother. \nMARIKA Oh.  I thought today was Saturday. \nMarian, seemingly reassured, opens the door for her.  She sees Marika, realizes she's upset about something, and feels immediately compassionate toward her. \nMARIKA I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night. \nMARIAN Oh.  You need a cappuccino. \nAnd she lets Marika in. \nINT. CO-OP - DAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nThey're sitting at the dining table, having coffee.  Marian is listening sympathetically to Marika's tale of woe. \nMARIKA And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up. (leans forward) So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year. \nMARIAN (shaking her head in disgust) Men ... they're all the same. (beat) Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister. \nThe Disciples dismounting from their bikes below, shutting down their engines and removing their helmets. \nINT. CO-OP - DAY \nAt the window, Marian and Marika standing side by side. \nMARIAN I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ... \nMARIKA ... Manly? \nMarian does a double-take and throws a backward glance at Marika. \nMARIKA You know, probably none of them had a mother like you. \nMarian and Marika smile at each other. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. EAST 5TH STREET - DAY \nMarian's FOOT STEPS OFF THE CURB. \nWIDER ANGLE - \nMarian crosses the street headed in the direction of the Satan's Disciples headquarters. \nThe black, forbidding door leading into the clubhouse with its painting of Death on a stylized Harley, gripping lightning bolts for handlebars. \nDISCIPLE PROSPECT - \nlooking at Marian looking up at the door. \nDISCIPLE PROSPECT Is there something else I can do for you? \nMARIAN Well, I'd love to see inside your club. \nDISCIPLE PROSPECT (taken aback) You want to come inside? \nMARIAN Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything. \nEXT. CLUBHOUSE ENTRANCE - DAY - A FEW MOMENTS LATER \nThe Disciple Prospect emerges from the club with the HEAD DISCIPLE, a gentle giant of a man with a long, flowing wispy beard and an old man's paunch.  They're muttering about something. \nDISCIPLE PROSPECT Her daughter lives across the street and she was wondering ... \nHEAD DISCIPLE What? \nDISCIPLE PROSPECT She's curious ... \nThe Head Disciple glances over at Marian standing curbside, expectantly awaiting approval.  He sees that she's ingenuous. \nMarian blushes at their warm response to her unexpected appearance. \nHEAD DISCIPLE (explaining her visit) Marian's daughter lives across the street and she was a little worried about her. \nDISCIPLE #1 Swear to God, lady, she's not here. \nLaughter erupts.  Marian smiles. \nDISCIPLE #2 Hey, is she cute? \nDISCIPLE #3 Does she like motorcycles? \nDISCIPLE #4 Can she cook? \nAmiable laughter fills the room.  Marian laughs with them. She glances all around her, fascinated by this dungeon she had dreamed and fantasized about since she first arrived in New York. \nMARIAN You know, this isn't so bad.  It looks like our kids' rooms when they were growing up. \nINSERT SHOTS - \nof overflowing ashtrays, crushed beer cans, fast food wrappers balled up and strewn on tables. \nBACK - \nto Marian, her brow knitted thoughtfully in a schoolmarmish expression. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CLUBHOUSE - DAY - STILL LATER \nAll the Disciples are huddled around Marian in the middle of the clubhouse, as if she were the mother hen, arms folded across their chests, smiles creasing their faces, sated. \nMARIAN Well, I'd better be going.  It was nice meeting all of you. \nDISCIPLE #1 Thanks, Marian. \nCHORUS OF OTHER DISCIPLES Thanks, Marian. \nDISCIPLE #2 The food was outstanding. \nMarian starts off. \nHEAD DISCIPLE You know, if we can do anything for you, Marian, you just let us know. \nMARIAN (turns, considers for a moment) Well, there is one thing. (beat, mildly scolding) At night, your motorcycles are so darn loud, I'm not getting much sleep.  Now, I'm going home in a few days, so ... could I ask you to keep them quiet? \nSome of the Disciples exchange petulant looks, rolling their eyes at the request. \nHEAD DISCIPLE (mollifying) Well, we'll, uh, see what we can do, Marian. \nAll the Disciples break into laughter. \nMARIAN (blurting out) I met the Satan's Disciples today. \nMR. PALMER (chuckling nervously) Really? \nPAULA Mother, I ... \nMARIAN (waving her daughter off) My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people. \nPaula and Mr. Palmer exchange disquieting glances. \nMR. PALMER (playing along) Well, that's a very unusual New York experience. \nMARIAN I had a wonderful time. \nPaula is in a mild state of shock hearing her mother's fantastical anecdote. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CO-OP - NIGHT \nPaula is sitting at the dining table with a plate piled with roast chicken, potatoes, and broccoli in front of her.  She has a worried look etched on her face. \nMarian is in the kitchen in the background, feeling light and happy, a singsong quality to her voice.  She brings a plate of food for herself to the table. \nMARIAN And they were so friendly those young men.  Though I do think they should shave their beards and ... and get some nicer clothes. \nPAULA (CONT'D) It's okay.  Dad's dying put a lot of stress on you.  But you're going to be all right.  We're all going to be all right.  Where did you get this vivid imagination, huh? \nPaula grips Marian's arm a little tighter and shakes it gently as if snapping her back to reality.  Marian returns her a tight-lipped smile. \nFADE OUT. \nINT. CO-OP - NIGHT \nMarian, lying supine on the convertible sofa bed by the open window, snoring peacefully. \nEXT. EAST 5TH STREET - NIGHT \nOn the sidewalk, the Disciple Prospect sits next to the fire breathing oil drum, standing sentry over the Harleys. \nOne of the Disciples comes out of the clubhouse and they high five.  The Disciple mounts his Harley and is about to kick start it to life, when the Disciple Prospect rises from his stool. \nDISCIPLE PROSPECT Yo, man! \nThe Disciple about to start his bike, turns. \nThe Disciple Prospect raises two fingers to his lips in a kind of warning, then gestures up to Paula's co-op where Marian is sleeping. \nThe Disciple, remembering the new rule, nods assent with a slightly annoyed expression. \nThen, he puts his Harley into neutral, dismounts, and starts slowly walking it down the quiet, ill-lit street. \n", "test1_input": "ACROSS THE STREET - \nThe BIKERS, wearing their club's colors embroidered on blue jeans, and leather, vests, back their motorcycles in a uniform row against the curb, kill their engines, park them at an angle on their kickstands, and dismount. \nThey high-five a biker known as the DISCIPLE PROSPECT, a small, mean-looking man with a red bandana tied taut over his head, and then disappear into the windowless clubhouse, passing through a large, forbidding, black door with the skeleton of Death riding a motorcycle painted on it. \nThe Disciple Prospect tosses the butt of a cigarette into a rusted steel drum and flames erupt. \nMARIAN - \nin horror, cannot pry her eyes away from them. \nNEW ANGLE - \nAn upstairs window on a six-story, red-brick co-op building. PAULA, Marian's daughter, a pretty woman with short dark hair, is leaning out the window, waving. \nPAULA Mom!  Hi!  I'll be right down. \nEXT. THE FRONT SECURITY DOOR - A FEW MOMENTS LATER \nPaula emerges to greet her mother. \nMarian glances one last time across the street and exchanges oblique looks with the Disciple Prospect, now parked on a stool next to the burning drum.  He seems to home in on her. \nINT. CO-OP - TWILIGHT - A FEW MOMENTS LATER \n", "test1_true": "PAULA So, what do you think? \nMARIAN Well, once you're inside, it's nice. \nPAULA You don't like where I live? \nMarian walks over to the window and peers out. \nMARIAN Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word! \nPAULA That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it. \nMarian returns her gaze to the view out the window. \nEXT. STREET - TWILIGHT - MARIAN'S P.O.V. - \nOut the window.  Two BIKERS stand with their arms crisscrossed against their leather-vested chests, framing the burning drum on the sidewalk, guarding the phalanx of Harleys. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CO-OP - NIGHT - LATER \nPaula and Marian are sitting at the dining table.  They're studying one of those plastic laminated maps of New York that you can buy everywhere.  Paula is attempting to acquaint her mother with Manhattan's complex public transportation system. \nPAULA You take the M-15 bus all the way to ... 79TH Street.  And then you take the crosstown bus to 5TH Avenue, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art is right there.  You can't miss it. \n", "test2_input": "EXT. NEW YORK - DUSK \nManhattan skyscrapers framed against a twilit sky. \nINT. RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT \nMarian and Paula are sitting at the bar.  They each have a glass of white wine in front of them.  Paula is looking at some PHOTOS of the farm that Marian has brought along. \nMARIAN Would you look at those strawberries. They made the best jam. (passes Paula the photos) Here are some more pictures of the farm. Crops were unbelievable this year. \nPaula continues to browse through the snaps. \nMARIAN Plenty of rain.  Your dad would have been happy with that. \nMarian removes a pill from a small vial she's rummaged out of her purse and slips it discreetly into her mouth. \nMARIAN I just can't seem to focus on anything these days. \nPAULA (turning to her mother) That's why it's good you came to visit me. \nMARIAN (washing her pill down with some wine) How are you doing sweetheart? \nPAULA I'm good. \nMARIAN Dating anyone? \n", "test2_true": "MARIAN What about the fellow in those pictures? \nPAULA What pictures? \nMARIAN You know ... (raises both hands in the air) ... whoops! \nPAULA (blushing) Mother! \nMARIAN Well, they were right out in plain view. \nPAULA Behind the books. \nMARIAN But I was dusting. \nPAULA (reluctantly explaining) I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications. \nMARIAN He seemed quite taken with you. \nPAULA I don't want to talk about it. \nMARIAN (hurt) You know, you never tell me anything. \nPAULA That's not true. (lays a placating hand on her mother's arm) Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York. \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_input": "EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY \nA lovely, sun-drenched day.  Shadows dapple a promenade along one of the park's many ponds.  Paula and Marian walk arm-in arm. \nPAULA I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer. \nMARIAN Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything. \nPAULA You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around. \nMARIAN Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling. \nPAULA I'd love to. \nThey walk off into the golden light. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CO-OP - DAY \nMarian is finishing up her packing.  Paula comes from the kitchen, bearing a gift for her mother to take home with her. \nPAULA Here you go. (Marian accepts the gift) I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay? \nMARIAN At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better. \n", "test3_true": "MARIAN I can make my own decisions. \nPaula extends her arms and embraces her mother. \nPAULA I love you, Mom. (turns to leave) I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right? \nMARIAN Mm hmm. \nPAULA (pulling on her backpack) Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring! \nMARIAN (pensive) Goodbye, sweetheart. \nPaula blows her mother a kiss and Marian throws her daughter a little wave. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. EAST 5TH STREET - DAY \nMarian steps down the stairs of her daughter's building.  A smile breaks out on her face when she SEES: \nA MOTORCADE - \nof idling Harleys in the middle of the street, waiting for her. \nMARIAN - \n"}

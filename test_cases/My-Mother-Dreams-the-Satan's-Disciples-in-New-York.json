SOUTH DAKOTAN FARM - DAY \nA lone farmhouse sits isolated against a prairie backdrop, silhouetted by a marbled dawn sky. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - DAY \nMARIAN PETERSON, a gray-haired woman in her late sixties, meticulously packs a suitcase.  She picks up a small, framed PHOTO from a chest-of-drawers and holds it up to her. \nINSERT - PHOTO \nIt's a picture of a man about Marian's age.  He has a sweet natured smile on his face.  Marian looks at it longingly, then packs it carefully in her suitcase between some sweaters and closes it up. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY \nA paint-chipped truck rounds the corner on a dirt road leading into the farm. \nMarian, waiting on the porch, ready to go, rises and waves. \nA FEW MOMENTS LATER - \n", "test1_true": "DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. THE SKY - DAY \nA JETLINER descending in the hot, cerulean sky. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL - AFTERNOON \nMarian, looking a little forlorn and out of sorts, stands out by the taxi area with her suitcase on a tote, looking around for a cab, unsure what to do. \nCURBSIDE - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nMISCHA, a somewhat dissolute-looking Russian cabbie in his thirties, roughhouses Marian's single piece of luggage into the dirty, cluttered trunk of his cab. \nINT. TAXI - DAY \nMarian is sitting in the back of the cab as Mischa opens the driver's side door and slams it shut, rattling Marian's nerves. \nMISCHA (brusquely) Where to? \nMARIAN Are you sure you got my bag in? \nMISCHA What do you think?  I left it on the curb? \n", "test1_id": 756, "test2_input": "EXT. EAST 5TH STREET - NIGHT \nMarian and Paula, arm-in-arm, walk down the block back to her building. \nA MOTORCYCLE rounds the corner, slows to a crawl, and one of the Satan's Disciples stares over at the two of them as if casing them out.  Paula won't look at him, but Marian can't avert her gaze. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CO-OP - NIGHT \nMarian lying awake in bed, the ENGINES of the Disciples' Harleys deafening ... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SATAN'S DISCIPLES' CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT \nDOLLY ACROSS a line of idling Harleys, the bikers, one at a time in succession, switching their single-beam headlights on. \nPAN ACROSS the FACES of the Disciples, mounted on their cycles, dark helmets, faded blue jeans jackets embroidered with elaborate stitching of their club's insignia, cigarettes dangling from their hirsute mouths, baleful-looking countenances, revving their engines loudly, tauntingly. \nNEW ANGLE - \nFrom across the street, Marian, appearing like an apparition in her nightgown, surreally walks toward them, a beseeching look on her face. \nMARIAN Excuse me.  Could you please turn your motorcycles off?  They're so loud, I can't sleep. \n", "test2_true": "INT. CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT \nWe follow Marian down a dark corridor leading into the bowels of the clubhouse. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. DREAM CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nAt the end of another corridor, a MAN stands, silhouetted against an explosion of blue light.  As we near the ghostly figure, we REALIZE it's Marian's deceased husband. \nThere's a GUN SHOT. \nSLAM CUT TO: \nINT. CO-OP - NIGHT \nMarian wakes with a start, clutching a hand to her breast. \nINT. KITCHEN - A FEW MOMENTS LATER \nMarian shakes a Valium out of a vial, puts it into her mouth, swallows it with a drink of orange juice. \nFADE TO: \nINT.

Hello? \nMarian returns her frightened gaze to the altercation across the street. \nACROSS THE STREET - MARIAN'S P.O.V. \nTwo more DISCIPLES emerge from the clubhouse.  One of them squirts lighter fluid on the fire burning in the steel drum and the flames explode.  Then KID is dragged over toward the fire.  The Disciple Prospect drags him dangerously close to the flames. \nDISCIPLE Roast him! \nKID (screaming) All right all right all right. \nMARIAN - \npetrified, as if she'd stepped into a re-enactment of a passage out of Revelations, walks briskly down to the middle of the block toward a pay phone. \nDISCIPLES CLUBHOUSE - \nThe Disciples kick the drug-dealing Teenager a couple more times, then set him free, laughing as he flees down the block in mortal fear. \nPAY PHONE - \n", "test3_true": "MARIAN (quavery voice) Yes, is Paula there? ... Could you leave her a message, please?  Tell her it's urgent. (gathers herself) Her mother has lost her keys and is stranded on the street with the Satan's Disciples ... When she comes back, would you tell her to come home as quickly as she can? ... Thank you. \nMarian hangs up the phone and turns, quails in terror. \nNEW ANGLE - \nThe Disciple Prospect is towering over her, staring down at her with a scowl on his face. \nMARIAN Oh, please, don't hurt me. \nDISCIPLE PROSPECT I just need to use the phone, lady. \nMARIAN Oh, let me get out of your way then. \nDISCIPLE PROSPECT What happened?  Did you lose your keys? \nMARIAN (withdrawing anxiously) Have a nice day. \nWIDE SHOT - \nMarian walks quickly ACROSS THE FRAME.  As she EXITS RIGHT, the Disciple Prospect ENTERS LEFT and trails after her. \nEXT. PAULA'S BUILDING - DAY - A FEW MOMENTS LATER \nMarian is at the front entrance, uncertain what to do.  She quailss when the Disciple Prospect approaches.  Without a word, he reaches his arm over her and presses a buzzer to one of the units. \n", "test3_id": 758}

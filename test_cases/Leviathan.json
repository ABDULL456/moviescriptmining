{"train": "\"Leviathan\", shooting draft, revised by Jeb Stuart \nLEVIATHAN \nScreenplay by \nDavid Webb Peoples \nand \nJeb Stuart \nRevised Draft \nSeptember 8, 1987 \nFACE IN ON \nTHE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN \nsunny and placid then slowly WE BEGIN DESCENDING UNDERWATER \nMoving down from the bright surface waters, through layers of fish and marine life... \nA school of vibrantly colored fish move with the current, their numbers are enormous, their movements in unison. Suddenly out of the darkness a barracuda cuts through the school, taking out four or five before disappearing into the shadows.  The school moves on as if nothing happened, quickly closing ranks where the missing ones swam only seconds before. \nWE MOVE DEEPER AND DEEPER \nFish disappear, darkness envelopes us.  Cold and lifeless where light has never penetrated...Five thousand feet, ten thousand.  Deeper, where only strange, self-illuminating echoniderms move eerily through the currents.  Then suddenly WE HEAR STATIC from RADIO TRANSMISSION.  THEN VOICES... \nJONES Burritos...Enchiladas... \nDEJESUS (hispanic voice) Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?... \nBOWMAN (female) I can't wait for fresh vegetables... \nSeveral voices suddenly break into argument...\"vegetables?\" \"shit,\" \"burgers\"...Suddenly another voice rises above the others. \nBECK'S VOICE/ RADIO Okay, cut the chatter.  You're not out of here, yet.  Who's the hook?  Seven?...You got a hook on container 22? \nA pause, then more voices. \nSIXPACK'S VOICE/ RADIO (redneck drawl) The man's asking if you're hooked on 22, you dumb shit. \nJONES' VOICE/ RADIO Watch your mouth, Sixpack.  Hello, Shack, Seven, here.  I ain't the hook, over. \nA light flares out of the darkness, suddenly illuminating an IMMENSE SHAPE--fifteen hundred pounds of hardened metal nearly seven feet tall.  It is a motorized diving suit and we see the stenciled name, WILLIE across the front breastplate.  As it pivots we see the stationary worklights around the base of a large underwater mining operation, THE SHACK.  Then a woman's voice. \nWILLIE'S VOICE (woman's voice) Six to Shack.  I'm the hook. \nINSIDE THE SHACK/ CONTROL ROOM \nlittered with papers, half-full coffee cups, and a confusion of wires and very low-tech, high-tech equipment BECK sits at the monitor controls.  He is younger than we expected, twenties, clean cut good looks.  He'll be a hell of a good- looking man at thirty-five, he just needs to be hardened. From the looks of the coffee cups around him he's on his way. \nBECK'S VOICE/ RADIO Okay, Six, let's wrap this container and call it a day. \nAbove him a bank of monitor screens.  Each one labeled with a crew member's name and providing a video picture from a camera mounted on their helmet.  Beck reaches above him and throws a console switch which activates another monitor labeled ROV.  With a joystick he manipulates an outside camera(the ROV), its picture we see on the monitor.  It is moving. \nUNDERWATER \nWILLIE'S POV  The inside of her helmet is a grid of LED gauges monitoring air reserve, body temperature, atmospheres, heart rate, blood pressure. \nShe stops next to a pair of railroad-like tracks and removes the tool attached to the end of her arm.  The move is practiced and professional, like a cook changing the tool on a set of egg beaters.  First, she inserts the existing tool into a lock on her opposite arm which holds it while she disengages the tool.  Next, she selects the next tool from the storage compartment at her waist and punches it into position.  Sixpack's voice comes over the radio. \nSIXPACK'S VOICE Hey, Willie, you trip on a tit or something?  We're all waiting on you, honey. \nWILLIE (under control) Keep your pants on Sixpack. I promise you'll be inside before \"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood\" comes on. \nOVER THE RADIO WE HEAR other men's voices laughing.  They like Willie and cheer her on.  \"Tell him, Willie,\" \"Atta girl,\" etc... \nWillie CLICKS in her last tool and turns.  Expertly she hooks a large dumpster-like container, the container to what looks like an underwater parachute--A CONTAINER TRANSPORTER--which when filled with oxygen it lifts the massive container onto the tracks where it can be hauled-in by a winch. \nWILLIE'S VOICE Six to Shack...Hook's on.  Ready to winch. \nCOBB Where's Doc?! \nBECK(RADIO) He's not at his station. \nDEJESUS (panicked) Oh, mother of Jesus, forgive me of my-- \nBECK'S VOICE (making a decision) Get him into the Shack. \nDeJesus' gauges begins a countdown to implosion.  \"15, 14, 13...\"  DeJesus is grabbed by his co-workers and hurried the last few yards to the SHACK. \nINSIDE/SHACK - SAME \nON BECK  sweating bullets, turns a dial on the instruments and suddenly, DeJesus' gauges jump to life.  We see the same countdown in progress on the Shack's gauges!..10, 9, 8... \nOUTSIDE \nON DEJESUS  He is forced into the LOCK, the underwater elevator room is eerily lit.  His readout continues inside his helmet...5, 4, 3...DeJesus screams. \nON BECK \nDeJesus' scream comes over his radio in the control room. Beck hits the elevator switch--nothing happens.  He hits it again harder and suddenly DeJesus voice is drowned out by the SCREAMING VACUUM PUMPS of the elevator.  It's moving! Beck looks up at the monitor of the interior Lift Lock. \nINSIDE/LIFT LOCK \nWE SEE DeJESUS'S SUIT dripping wet.  It stands inside the Lift Lock, ankle deep in greasy bilge water. \nCLOSE ON HIS EYES, for a moment they remain closed, then suddenly they flutter.  He's alive! \nTHE MESS - LATER \nThe blackboard prominently displayed on the wall of the Mess features neatly stenciled letters that say:  \"DAYS TILL PICKUP\".  The number scrawled on the chalk-smudged board obviously changes daily.  Right now, it's a \"3\"... \nA CLUNK, CLUNK and a Coke can rolls out of a compact COKE MACHINE.  A big, sandy-haired man, SIXPACK, takes the soft drink, pops the top and downs it in one long pull while he looks over an arguing group of deep sea miners:  JONES, Black, athletic, 30's;  COBB, 50's, a career miner with a mouthful of gum;  BOWMAN, 35, attractive, hardened woman, she has seen more of the world than any of them;  WILLIE, twenties, fresh good looks, master electrician, optimist. DEJESUS, Latino, wiry muscles, he keeps his head down, still shaken from his experience. \nThe strain of a month of working two miles beneath the ocean's surface has drawn nerves tight. \nBOWMAN I'm telling you, it's the suits! \nJONES Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened! \nSIXPACK And just what the fuck would he have done to stop it, huh? \nSixpack looks over the group, then suddenly crushes the empty Coke can in his hand, punctuating the action with a huge belch. \nSIXPACK(cont'd) That would have been you, DeJesus... \nDeJesus keeps his head down. \nSIXPACK(cont'd) Yeah...I was standing next to a guy who blew a suit once in the Indian Ocean...little tiny hole in the fucking toe of his suit ...ocean came in and the pressure crammed his whole fucking body up into his helmet. They just buried his helmet. \nDEJESUS (coldly) I know all about implosion, man. \nSIXPACK Yeah, I bet you do. (laughs) I bet you were imploding in your pants. (laughs then imitates a hysterical DeJesus) Jonesy!  Doc!...Help me!  Help me! \nDeJesus springs for Sixpack's throat AS WE CUT TO \nBECK - SAME \nBeck's eyes are blazing with cold authority as he speaks. \nBECK Knock it off, Sixpack!  I know it's been a long month for every- one, but we can't let something like this tear us apart... \nBeck glares, ready for an argument, but as WE PULL BACK we see he's talking to the mirror, in his tiny quarters. \nApparently he fails to convince himself because his hard look fades and he mutters unhappily as he turns away. \nBECK Shit... \nHe turns around to face a smiling picture of himself at college graduation with his Eastern establishment looking father.  Leadership \"how-to\" books like The One Minute Manager, etc. line his bookshelf with technical manuals on underwater mining. \nHe opens his door to leave when SUDDENLY A LOUD METALLIC GROANING NOISE stops him cold.  The entire Shack seems shifting, like a giant waking from a nap. \nMESS \nJONES Uh, oh...I see where this is going... \nBECK (ignoring Jones) ...all of you owe time and I thought tonight would be a good time to--- \nCOBB (erupting) No way, Mister Beck!  No fucking way!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation! \nJONES Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward! \nSIXPACK Hear that Becky, er, Mr. Beck? Company got to abide by the rules. \nFIVE FACES STARE AT BECK.  THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WEAKNESS. THIS IS A CHALLENGE TO HIS AUTHORITY. \nBECK I know all about the contract. The point is you can follow the goddamn contract to the letter and pull your shack duty tomorrow...or you can get it done tonight and call tomorrow a down day.  It's up to you. \nThis leaves the group momentarily speechless.  Even DeJesus comes out of his stupor. \nDEJESUS You giving us a day off? \nBeck nods.  Cobb eyes him suspiciously. \nCOBB What about our quota? \nBECK You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day. (he looks at the group) It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help. \nThe others look around for agreement but Jones doesn't need anyone else's approval, he's already made up his mind. \nJONES Count me in. \nBowman nods her head also and the others unanimously agree. Buoyed, Beck moves ahead, businesslike... \nBECK Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system... (to Bowman and Sixpack) Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters... \nSIXPACK (disgustedly) Shit... \nBECK Williams...get DeJesus' suit on the \"sick rack\" and do a diagnostics. (to group) Any other suit problems she should know about? \nSixpack suddenly looks up as the group disperses. \nSIXPACK (to Willie) My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey? \nWILLIE (annoyed) Your pocket? \nSIXPACK The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge. \nWILLIE (disgusted) Right. \nLOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME \nON BECK  He starts out of the Mess and by chance finds himself walking with Willie.  Beck is obviously uncomfortable with the crew, even after 28 days together. She smiles, friendly, at ease. \nWILLIE You did good... \nBECK (a little surprised) What? \nWILLIE Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside... \nBECK There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit... \nWILLIE Still...you did the right thing. \nShe turns off toward the Swamp, leaving Beck with the tiny, but honest compliment.  He savors it. \nTHE SWAMP - LATER \nThe \"Swamp\" (where DeJesus came up), is ankle deep in greasy bilgewater.  The door slides open, Willie enters, and switches on a bank of fluorescent lights.  The room is spooky even with the lights.  The giant machine suits, we saw earlier outside, hang from racks like sleeping monsters. \nWillie straps on a utility belt and checks her tools--a motorized screwdriver, a power wrench, a long-necked, laser-tipped soldering iron(looks like a long-necked screwdriver)--then splashes through the bilge water to the control switch and hits the START button. \nNNNNNNNNNN.  A motor moves one of the suits along the track toward Willie.  As it turns the corner toward us we see it says:  DEJESUS. \nDOC'S OFFICE - SAME \nBeck opens the door to Doc's quarters and we see Doc putting on a fresh shirt.  A man in his 50's, he must have once been quite handsome and intelligent, but has now gone to seed. \nMARTIN(cont'd) The one thing I've learned in this company is you can't have enough friends.  It's the only way to survive. \nCLOSE ON A BOOM BOX/ LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME \nThe boom box sitting on a wall pipe is blaring John Denver's Rocky Mountain High. \nDeJesus is singing along loudly in his thick accent as he works on the intercom system.  He finishes, closing a metal box which says:  ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS. \nSWAMP - SAME \nON WILLIE  She has connected DeJesus' suit to the diagnostic computer and is going through the computerized checkpoints--an electronic list of literally hundreds of possible problems. \nWILLIE (to herself) Probably a short. \nSuddenly, the computer pauses on one:  It says:  Electrical Short. \nWILLIE(cont'd) Good guess, Williams. \nShe types in a \"help\" command and the computer screen displays an electrical circuit pattern that would leave most Electrical Engineers baffled.  Willie hardly bats an eye. \nWILLIE(cont'd) Piece of cake. \nShe immediately opens the circuit panel on DeJesus' suit and pulls the laser soldering iron out of her tool belt.  With two quick spot welds she repairs the short, then replaces the panel.  Finished, Willie presses the control switch and the suits begin to move along the track.  A new suit rounds the corner toward us.  It says SIXPACK. \nTHE BILGE - SAME \nThe walls are dark and moist.  Water drips from the pipes. The rattle in the air system continues loudly as Jones leans over and hands Cobb another tool.  Crouched in the humming machinery, Cobb spits his wad of chewing gum into a greasy hand, kneads it a couple of times, then grins at Jones. \nCOBB Okay, watch this.. \nTHE SWAMP - SAME \nThe monotonous clatter of the air system is the only sound in the gloomy SWAMP as the huge suit labeled SIXPACK stops directly in front of Willie.  She reaches up to open the pocket latch when she stops...listening.  THE NOISE IN THE AIR SYSTEM HAS STOPPED. \nTHE BILGE - SAME \nJones looks incredulously at Cobb.  He can't believe that's all it took.  Cobb starts gathering up the tools. \nJONES So that's all you do?... \nCOBB Shhhh...don't tell no one. (winks) Job security. \nTHE SWAMP - SAME \nIn the gloomy silence, Willie reaches for the hinged pocket in the waist of Sixpack's suit.  Some water drips out.  She pushes the spring a second time.  The pocket opens. Nothing. \nWILLIE (miffed) Nothing wrong with this... \nSUDDENLY THE HIDEOUS SEA SPIDER SPRINGS OUT onto the workbench where it wriggles grotesquely toward Willie.  She backs away and it drops into the water at her feet. \nTHE DORMITORY \nBowman looks at DeJesus who comes to the door, then to Sixpack who convulses with laughter against the bulkhead. \nWILLIE'S VOICE(O.C.) (over intercom) Fuck you, Sixpack!  You think you're funny?  You're not funny! \nON BECK \nHe hesitates then presses the TALK button on the intercom. \nBECK This is Beck.  Is there a problem, Williams? \nSWAMP \nWillie watches the Sea Spider move in the water toward her as Beck's words come over the P.A.  Ignoring Beck she watches the spider right as it moves to her feet then brings the soldering iron down into the water with a LOUD HISS skewering it.  She presses the intercom button and lifts the skewered sea spider out of the water. \nWILLIE (to Beck) A little problem, sir...but I've got a handle on it now. \nTIME CUT TO: \nTHE MESS - LATER \nBOWMAN sits at a portable computer terminal and watches stock prices scroll across the screen.  Every so often she freezes a stock and types the command:  INFO.  The screen immediately changes to a financial report of the company in question as if prepared by a broker.  In a matter of seconds Bowman can learn all the major aspects of the company. \nJONES Hey, Hazy!  We got a day off tomorrow, Kemosabi!  Let's get shit-faced! \nDEJESUS catches the can and pops the top sending a shower of carbonation all over Cobb under the sunlamp. \nJONES(cont'd) How about you, brother Cobb? Little Wild Turkey? \nCobb wipes the Coke from his sunglasses and shakes his head. \nDEJESUS No, man, Cobb is a Chivas drinker, from way back.  Ain't that right Cobbie? \nJones and DeJesus laugh and take long pulls on their Cokes. Cobb turns and watches them.  This is obviously a nightly ritual. \nCOBB You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for? \nDEJESUS (acting drunk) What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana... \nCOBB You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin. \nDEJESUS (laughing) I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes. \nINT. SIXPACK'S BUNK - SAME \nCLOSE ON  The Pet of the Month as she smirks coyly from the centerfold, her body twisted into an awkward position representing mad desire. \nSixpack closes his privacy door then smirks back at the photo. \nSIXPACK Oh, Darlin'...come sit on my face... \nHe stirs in the bed and adjusts his pillow and SCREAMS!  The SEA SPIDER is suddenly right there on his shoulder, dead. \nSixpack sits bolt upright in his bunk and slams his head against the roof of the bunk, then stumbles out screaming. He hits the floor and rams his foot into a table and screams in more pain. \nThe whole dorm looks up amazed, Cobb takes off his sunglasses, even Jones and DeJesus temporarily \"sober up\" to stare. \nSIXPACK That bitch! \nMESS \nSixpack storms into the Mess with the dead Sea Spider.  He points angrily at his bleeding foot.  Jones and DeJesus move up to watch. \nSIXPACK (moving into room) Bitch!  Look what you did! \nWILLIE (imitating Sixpack) Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?... \nEveryone laughs, but Sixpack.  He has revenge in his eyes. He holds out the ugly, limp creature and advances toward Willie. \nSIXPACK You think you're so funny? Wait till you taste this! \nAs he pushes the dead creature into her face BECK'S VOICE behind him makes him freeze. \nBECK'S VOICE(O.S.) That's enough! \nEverybody turns to see Beck standing in the doorway. \nSIXPACK Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk! \nBECK (cold as ice) How do you know it was Williams? \nSIXPACK (trapped) Huh?  I...uh...uh... \nBECK All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow-- \nSIXPACK AND WILLIE (protesting) Bullshit!  What?!  She...He... \nBECK (cutting them off) At ease!  You both have a half day...Anymore shit and its a full one. \nCLOSE ON BLACKBOARD/ MESS - MORNING \nSCREECH!  Chalk on the blackboard as Bowman writes \"2\" in place of yesterday's \"3\" over the neatly lettered words \"Days Till Pickup.\" \nJones, sitting next to Cobb, looks up from his tray of cereal and holds his head in mock misery. \nJONES Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music. \nWILLIE (to Sixpack) You screw around like that again and-- \nSIXPACK What's wrong, did you miss me? \nWILLIE Hardly. \nSIXPACK Don't worry, darlin, I'm... \nSuddenly Sixpack's foot hits some loose rock and slides. \nWillie turns in his direction and sees his headlight turning, becoming smaller, then disappearing as his radio goes dead. \nINSIDE ON BECK \nBECK What's wrong?!  What happened? \nUNDERWATER \nON WILLIE  She has stopped in her tracks.  All around her is blackness.  Her helmet light hardly penetrates the darkness. \nWILLIE Sixpack?!  Sixpack... \nThen she looks down--a cliff right in front of her feet. The drop is thirty feet into a waving sea of tubers. \nBECK'S VOICE brings Willie back. \nBECK'S VOICE(RADIO) Willie?  What's going on? \nWILLIE He's gone.  I think he's fallen.  I'm going down after him. \nMESS \nJones is bench pressing 200 pounds on a fold-down compact gym, while DeJesus huffs and puffs on an exercise bike. \nDEJESUS That's it Jonesy...Sweat it out, man...Got to get the poison out of our blood. \nJones grits his teeth and struggles against the weight, suddenly Bowman throws open the door and sticks her head in. \nBOWMAN Sixpack is lost. \nCORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER \nBowman, Jones and DeJesus are heading for the control room where they are joined by Cobb. \nCOBB Weren't they tied?  They're supposed to be tied. \nThey all enter the \nCONTROL ROOM \nBeck is at the console with Doc in his chair. \nJONES How far away is she? \nDOC Two hundred meters. \nWILLIE'S VOICE silences them. \nWILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO) Four to Shack...nearing the bottom.  Look at this... \nThey all stare at the monitor.  The screen is filled with huge waving tubers. \nDOC My God, look at the size of those tubers.... \nDEJESUS Nine, ten feet high... \nBOWMAN If he had his blinkers on-- \nJONES It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him! \nUNDERWATER \nON WILLIE  She moves through the dense waving forest of giant tubers, parting them with her hands as she moves slowly. \nBOWMAN (reading off of Beck's forms) Two...twelve...ninety-six. \nSIXPACK (scoffingly) You guys are so full of shit... Who's going to use their birthday... \nDEJESUS VOICE (over intercom) BINGO! \nSIXPACK (suddenly sitting up) Like I said, that bottle's mine! \nCONTROL ROOM - SAME \nON Beck at the door and Doc. \nDOC I want your permission to check that vodka. \nBeck looks at him.  It is obvious that he doesn't trust Doc, with the vodka, but he's diplomatic. \nBECK This is a mining shack, not a lab, Doc.  If there's something strange with the vodka it's safe till we get back. \nUPPER RING CORRIDOR \nON COBB  Standing watch for DeJesus.  Suddenly the door to the Control room opens and Beck walks out.  Cobb grabs a walkie-talkie. \nCOBB Beck's coming. \nBECK'S QUARTERS/ ON DEJESUS \nHe hears Cobb and freezes.  He looks around--the cramped quarters don't offer much in the way of hiding places. \nINTERCUT WITH BOWMAN AND OTHERS IN DORMATORY \nThey react similarly to the sound of Cobb on the P.A. \nON COBB AND BECK/ CORRIDOR \nBeck stops outside his door and sees Cobb. \nBECK Something wrong, Cobb? \nCOBB (struggling) Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir... \nBECK What's wrong with it? \nCOBB (thinking fast) ...I'd really have to show it to you. \nBECK (beat) All right... \nCobb smiles, he can't believe his luck, then Beck holds up the videotape. \nBECK(cont'd) ...Just let me put this in my safe... \nBefore Cobb can react Beck opens the door to his quarters and steps inside. \nBECK'S QUARTERS  WE SEE no sign of DeJesus.  Cobb follows into the room, looking carefully around for sign of DeJesus. \nIn the mirror to Beck's bathroom, Cobb spots DeJesus pressing against the wall.  Cobb suddenly starts to sweat bullets.  Beck quickly unlocks the safe, opens it, and puts the videotape right next to the bottle of Vodka. \nWe see Cobb's reaction.  Beck turns. \nBECK Something wrong? \nCobb shakes his head weakly and starts to follow Beck out, he sneaks a look back at DeJesus in the shadows who gives him a thumbs up. \nMESS - LATER \nFive specimen cups filled with vodka.  Bowman takes hers and looks at it questioningly.  Cobb watches the door for signs of the officers. \nBOWMAN Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups? \nJONES Aw, loosen up, Bowman... (he looks over and notices Willie) Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you. \nWillie shakes her head. \nWILLIE No, thanks.  I've got my blood tests in three days. \nINT. INFIRMARY/ SHACK - SAME \nDoc is at the console of his computer.  As words appear on the screen, obviously in response to his query... \n\"...would appear to indicate a virus of unknown origin...\" \nDoc shakes his head disgustedly. \nDOC (to himself) No kidding?  \"A virus of unknown origin.\"  Come on and tell me something I don't know... like what's going on... \nON SCREEN \nMore words come up.  \"...no idea...\" \nDOC(cont'd) (typing, angrily) Then take a guess, goddamnit! \nHe finishes typing and waits for an answer.  The cursor flashes the word \"PROCESSING\".  Then an answer comes up. \"Genetic Alteration?\"  The words send a chill down Doc's spine. \nSWAMP ROOM - LATER \nThe mood is happy.  Like a high school football locker room after a winning game.  DeJesus climbs out of his suit and slaps Beck on the shoulder. \nDEJESUS Good work out there, Mr. Becky. \nBeck, obviously pleased, looks at the others.  Jones sums up the feelings of the entire group. \nJONES Thank you, sir. \nBeck's grin suddenly disappears at the sight of a flashing red light over the intercom. \nINFIRMARY - LATER \nBeck is standing in the doorway of the Infirmary, glaring at Doc, who sits with his bottle of Old Granddad. \nBECK Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder. \nDOC He did. \nBECK Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?! \nDoc looks at Beck wearily and hands him a mask. \nDOC Here.  Put this on.  You examine him. \nBECK I'm not a doctor. \nDOC For this...you don't need to be. \nBeck hesitates, then puts on the mask. \nSICK ROOM \nAs Beck enters, masked, Sixpack's back is to him under the sheets.  Slowly he pulls back the sheet and recoils from the sight.  The black splotches have nearly all grown together. His fingers have lengthened and become more webbed.  Most dramatically the sores on the sides of his neck have become flared and elongated.  Though not bleeding, the open veins are visible. \nINFIRMARY \nDoc pours some bourbon in a glass, and takes a sip.  Beck enters dazed from the sick room and their eyes meet. \nBECK The mask is because you think it might be...catching? \nDOC I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses... \nBECK (impatiently) And? \nDOC And they didn't believe the symptoms I described... \nBECK (beat) Why Sixpack? \nDOC It could be a million things, something in the air, food.... (he looks up and locks eyes with Beck) But he went on that ship and so did Williams... (beat) I want to examine the crew. \nBECK (still in shock) Yeah...right... \nHe starts to the door and Doc watches him. \nDEJESUS' VOICE(O.S.) What do you mean, \"a skin problem\"... your skin changes? \nDeJesus, naked, with his back to us.  Doc examines him. \nDOC It blackens...becomes scaly. \nDEJESUS (joking) You mean like a fish? \nDeJesus chuckles, but something about the thought stops Doc. \nDOC (almost to himself) Yes...like a fish... \nDEJESUS (smiles) I was just joking, Doc. \nCONTROL ROOM - SAME \nBeck sits in his chair reading the TRANSOCEAN OFFICERS INSTRUCTIONAL MANUAL. \nINSERT:  The chapter he's on says:  BODY DISPOSAL AT SEA. \nThe face of Martin stares back at us. \nMARTIN Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that. \nBECK What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy. \nMARTIN But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you? \nBECK I'm not anxious to find out, either. \nMARTIN Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours. \nBECK Do it. \nMARTIN (beat) Unfortunately.  We can't. \nHe picks up a sheet of computer paper. \nMARTIN(cont'd) There is a typhoon about 600 miles off the coast of Baja. It's not coming your way but the Company doesn't want to lose you folks or an emergency ship should it veer your way. \nBECK What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow? \nMARTIN It shouldn't be a long delay. \nBECK But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?! \nMARTIN Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry. \nWASHROOM - SAME \nWillie enters the room with several sinks and a couple of toilet stalls.  She approaches one of the sinks and pulls a toothbrush from the pocket of her robe. \nWILLIE Bo?  Doc says you're next. \nJust then she hears a retching sound from one of the stalls. \nWILLIE(cont'd) Bo?...You okay? \nINFIRMARY - SAME \nWillie and Jones help Bowman into the Infirmary.  She is weak from nausea.  They help her onto the examination table and look around for Doc.  Jones sees a light on in the Sick Room. \nSICK ROOK - SAME \nSixpack's body lies under a sheet in the Sick room.  The door opens and Jones looks in, sees Sixpack but in the dim light, doesn't realize the sheet covering him, covers the body totally.  Jones smiles. \nJONES (whispers) Hey, Sixpack...Hey, my man... How you feeling? \nThere is no answer and Jones slowly approaches the body. \nJONES Hey, man, we made quota to- day.  No thanks to you, you dog, but we made it...Beck helped us...We just dropped Bowman off.  I hope what you've got ain't catching... \nHe is almost to the table and reaches out to touch Sixpack when suddenly the body stirs.  Sixpack's foot moves slightly under the sheet as if shifting in his sleep.  Jones stops. \nDOC Bowman? \nThere is no answer and he moves toward the shower. \nDOC Bowman.  It's Doc.  I'm here to help you. \nThe water continues to run.  No answer.  Carefully, Doc opens the shower door. \nWHAT HE SEES:  Bowman.  Dead.  Her wrists have been cut and blood swirls down the drain. \nDoc sadly squats down beside her.  The death effects him greatly.  He feels helpless, then suddenly his eyes widen and he carefully reaches out and takes Bowman's limp arm, turning it supine.  There, running the length of the arm, WE SEE the black scales. \nINFIRMARY \nJones and Beck lay Bowman's body carefully onto the examination table in the infirmary.  Through the Sick Room door we see the sheet shrouded body of Sixpack.  Doc covers Bowman with a sheet as \nWE CUT TO \nTHE MESS - LATER \nThe remaining crew, Doc, and Beck assembled in the Mess. Doc sits quietly, almost in a daze. \nBECK I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms. \nDEJESUS And it killed Bo? \nBECK No...she killed herself. \nON WILLIE  the news hits her hard. \nJONES We're getting out of here just in time. \nBECK There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours... \nDEJESUS Typhoon?! \nJONES Twelve hours! \nCOBB At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract. \nJONES Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here! \nTheir argument is suddenly cut short by a NOISE from the corridor.  A THUMP!  The crew stops their grumbling and listens.  A moment later we hear another THUMP!  Beck looks at Jones. \nBECK (motions for Jones to come with him) Jones... (to the others) Stay here. \nRING CORRIDOR \nBeck leads the way slowly toward the Infirmary where the sound is coming from.  Outside the door they hear it once more.  THUMP! \nCarefully he enters the Infirmary and WE SEE the examination table is empty!  Beck goes to the Sick room and stops in the doorway.  Jones moves behind him and his eyes suddenly widen. \nWHAT THEY SEE:  Both bodies now are in a motionless, hideous conglomeration on the the table. \nSLAM CUT TO \nCLOSE ON HEAVY ZIPPER \nZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.  It is quickly pulled shut, running the length of a heavy plastic bag, closing both bodies inside. \nINT. CORRIDOR \"B\" - LATER \nDressed in their rubber latex suits Cobb, Jones, DeJesus, Beck, and Willie carry the body of Sixpack and Bowman in the zippered bodybag.  Now, well over three hundred pounds, the bodies strange shape and dead weight make it difficult to transport. \nDEJESUS C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking... \nCOBB (angrily) I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!.. \nBefore Jones can argue, Beck cuts them off. \nBECK Shut up, all of you. \nCOBB Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of--- \nSHOWERS - LATER \nClouds of steam.  Vaguely seen through the steam, Willie is scrubbing herself almost desperately, as though the spattered blood of the creature had penetrated into her skin.  Finally she gives up almost in tears and rests her head against the wall of the shower stall. \nDORMITORY - SAME \nBeck and Jones open the privacy door to Sixpack's bunk. After some digging which produces five month's supply of pornography, the empty flask clatters to the floor.  Beck picks it up. \nBECK I think we just found our problem. \nMESS - LATER \nCobb pours himself a cup of coffee with a shaky hand.  Jones, and DeJesus sit at a table and Willie laces up her shoes for a run.  There is a feeling of anger among them. \nDEJESUS Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish. \nJONES 'Fucker could have gotten us all killed. \nCOBB He knew better than that. \nWillie finishes tying up her shoes and looks at them all coldly. \nWILLIE You guys sure weren't so holy when you were shooting that vodka...It could have been you. \nShe gets up and walks out into the Ring corridor. \nTHE RUSSIAN SHIP \nWE ARE MOVING along the ship's corridor that Willie walked looking for Sixpack. \nWE PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE WATCHING A VIDEO SCREEN IN THE CONTROL ROOM \nDoc and Beck replay the tape of Willie's search for Sixpack on the Russian ship.  On the monitor screen we see Willie's POV of the infirmary.  The light dances off the broken glass as she turns, then the flash of white we saw before as the light moves out into the corridor. \nDOC Hold it!  Rewind it. \nBeck rewinds it. \nON SCREEN  we see the scene again.  Light dancing off the cabinets.  As the light starts to turn-- \nDOC Stop it. \nBeck pauses the tape.  We see nothing. Doc is confused. \nDOC Back it up slowly. \nBeck does and we watch Doc's face as he stares intently at the screen.  Suddenly he sees it. \nDOC There. \nON SCREEN  We see it.  Caught in the turn of the camera, now frozen on the screen is the clear gleaming skeletal remains of a man.  Only it is clear that this is no ordinary man. Fingers and appendages are lengthened and broader than normal.  But it is the large head and long sharp teeth that especially catches our attention. \nMESS - SAME \nON A BEAUTIFUL BAVARIAN SETTING \nas a hand suddenly moves into frame and we see the scene is actually one of DeJesus' jigsaw puzzles.  He takes a piece of blue sky from the hundreds of pieces on the table and places it perfectly into position on the puzzle.  Jones watches him amazed. \nDEJESUS You know that Innsbruck has 64 square miles of ski slopes, man?  Think about that. Sixty-four square miles. \nHe picks up another piece of blue sky and effortlessly fits it into place as Jones watches.  It's blowing Jones' mind. \nJONES How'd you do that? \nDEJESUS What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry. \nHe gets up to go into the mess and Jones looks at him in amazement. \nJONES Hungry?  After what we just went through I may never eat again. \nON WILLIE \nShe jogs down the corridors toward the Swamp.  The Shack CREAKS and Willie looks down through the grating passing below her feet.  It is dark down there.  Her feet pound off the metal grating. \nHe notices that the floor's wet near the sink.  He frowns and hears a SMALL NOISE, like something shifting slightly. He moves to investigate, crouching low, peeking into the shadows under the sink, into a litter of cleanser bottles, pails, rags...All he can see are shadows.  He looks more closely, actually sticking his head under the sink when \nSUDDENLY SOMETHING TOUCHES HIS SHOULDER FROM BEHIND!  DEJESUS JUMPS, BUMPING HIS HEAD ON THE SINK AS HE WHIRLS TO SEE. \nJONES, looming over his shoulder, looking down at him. \nJONES Man, everybody is jumpy... What are you doing? \nNot fully recovered from the start, DeJesus rubs his bruised head. \nDEJESUS Getting some food. \nJONES Under there? \nDeJesus gets to his feet, points at the water under the sink. \nDEJESUS Look.  Water. \nJONES Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what? \nDeJesus continues to scrutinize the water then looks back at Jones. \nDEJESUS No, I'll be right there. \nHe looks down at his sandwich as Jones starts out of the galley.  Something is missing. \nDEJESUS (to himself) Mustard.  Need mustard... \nHe opens the refrigerator and finds the mustard jar empty. \nDEJESUS (muttering to himself) Sixpack... \nHe throws the jar in the trash then opens the cabinet next to the refrigerator for a new jar, and reaches inside. \nSUDDENLY, LIKE A SNAKE, A TWO FOOT CHUNK OF MUSCLE ATTACHES TO DEJESUS'S WRIST!  WITH HIS FREE HAND DEJESUS TRIES TO RIP THE TWISTING, WRITHING THING OFF.  PULLING AT IT HE REVEALS PART OF SIXPACK'S FACE--ONE EYE AND PART OF HIS MOUTH--UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE. \nDeJesus falls against the side cabinets screaming and causing an avalanche of pots and pans. \nDEJESUS (in pain) Ahhh! \nINSIDE THE MESS \nJones is now putting a piece of the puzzle into place when he hears THE CLATTER OF POTS AND PANS. \nJONES Hey, Hazy...what're you doing now...cooking? \nThere is no answer and Jones looks up. \nJONES(cont'd) (concerned) Hazy?... \nHe goes to the door and looks in.  His eyes widen at the sight of DeJesus staggering toward him with the squeezing hunk of muscle. \nJONES(cont'd) Holy shit! \nDEJESUS Help me, Jonesy.  Oh, God, help me!  It's getting inside me, I can feel it! \nHe keeps coming at Jones who backs away slowly from his friend. \nJONES Hazy, please...I'm going to get you some help, man...just don't touch me... \nJones finds himself backing away until he is by the door to the Galley.  He closes it, rushing through into the Mess to the Ring corridor where he runs into Cobb. \nCOBB What's going on? \nJONES It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc. \nJones runs out and leaves Cobb by the door.  Cobb watches him go.  As the noise in the Mess intensifies, we hear banging on the door, then DeJesus' anguished cries. \nDEJESUS Help me!  Help me! \nCobb backs slowly down the corridor toward the dorm. \nUPPER RING CORRIDOR - SAME \nBECK I thought they were your friends? \nJONES Were, Doss were. \nBeck reaches out and takes the powerful weapon away from him. \nBECK You fire that in here and you'll bring the whole place down. \nJones thinks about it for a moment, then reaches for one of the Acetylene tanks.  He lights the end of it and a long blue tongue of flame whips out the door into the Swamp. Jones grins. \nINFIRMARY - SAME \nDoc and Cobb move into the Infirmary.  Doc goes into his office.  He takes three scalpels out of an equipment drawer and then looks up, through the levolor blinds into the infirmary.  What he sees upsets him. \nINT. SWAMP - SAME \nJones working the intercom. \nJONES (to intercom) Jones to Doc.  Doc?...Cobb? \nHe looks back to Beck, concerned. \nJONES(cont'd) (to Beck) Think it got 'em? \nBECK No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that? \nJONES (beat, realizing) He did. \nINFIRMARY - SAME \nDoc leaves his office and slowly goes into the Infirmary to the storage counter across the room--where the blood is stored.  WE SEE what disturbed him...the door to the refrigeration unit is ajar.  Doc opens the door to the cabinet.  The plastic bags are now empty.  Each one has been drained. \nLOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME \nCobb moves out of the Infirmary, carefully down the eerie corridor, his mining tool in front of him for security. There is a sinister feel to the place.  Each step only reveals a little bit of space ahead of him.  Suddenly he stops.  In front of him across the hall a cabinet which says:  ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS, is torn open.  It is where DeJesus fixed the intercom the day before. \nCLOSE ON THE CABINET \nThe door is shattered.  Carefully, Cobb opens the door and WE SEE the guts of the wiring have been torn out--the entire system has been disabled. \nCobb carefully examines the damage WHEN SUDDENLY A SCALY HAND-LIKE APPENDAGE slams into the cabinet door trapping COBB and sending his weapon to the floor.  Cobb turns directly into \nTHE LEECH-LIKE MOUTH!  It's sharp teeth shine in the light, poised to strike. \nCobb's eyes closed, screams like a maniac, waiting for the tentacle to attack.  Then suddenly an UNGODLY SCREAM echoes in the corridor. \nCOBB opens his eyes to see the tentacle gone.  Doc is holding the smoking mining drill, his eyes glazed, as if he has seen the devil itself. \nCOBB What happened? \nDOC (absently) It...almost got you. \nCOBB What was it? \nDoc shakes his head dumbly.  He is in total shock. \nTHE MESS \nThe remaining group is assembled around the table.  Jones watches the door with one of the homemade flamethrowers.  He listens. \nCOBS (excitedly) I saw it!  It's big! \nBECK Big? \nJONES Bigger than DeJesus?  How? \nDOC It's had a meal. \nHe holds out the empty blood bags.  A change has come over Doc since Bowman's death.  The experience has slightly deadened him. \nWILLIE It needs blood? \nJONES Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us? \nINSERT COBB'S WOUND  Pink and healing. \nDOC Looks good to me.  I'll re-bandage it, though. \nHe looks at Willie. \nDOC(cont'd) Willie, would you clean it for me.  I'm going to the infirmary for supplies. \nHe turns and Willie stops him with a firm grip. \nWILLIE You can't go out there alone. \nDOC I'm the Doctor.  I have to do what's best for this crew. (he pulls away) I need my bag. \nTHE LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME \nThe door opens and carefully Doc steps out into the corridor.  He looks toward the Infirmary then starts up the ladder to the Upper Level instead. \nCLOSE ON DROPS OF BLOOD INTO A SMALL POOL \na grisly sight. \nWE PULL BACK TO REVEAL the drops coming from the plasma bag of Beck's blood.  Beck stops the drip and moves on into the darkness of the corridor. \nCONTROL ROOM \nDoc moves behind the computer keyboard in the dim light of the Control room.  His face lit by the computer monitor.  He types furiously. \nCOMPUTER SCREEN \n\"Emergency Escape Bubbles...ready for activation...\" \nDOC pauses looking at the message, then moves his hand to the SEND command and presses it. \nTHE MESS - LATER \nWillie prepares a clean bandage as Doc examines the cut.  He smiles at Cobb like a friendly country doctor.  The tired look now gone from his eyes.  He seems revitalized. \nDOC There, good as new.  Just keep your paws off of it. (to Willie) Do you have the new bandage ready? \nShe nods.  Doc turns back to the sink and Cobb holds out his arm to let Willie put the new bandage on.  As Cobb's arm comes up we suddenly notice a slight movement under his shirt.  Willie stops just before applying the bandage.  The movement intensifies--like snakes moving wildly beneath the cloth.  Cobb whitens...breaks out in a sweat.  Willie backs off. \nWILLIE Doc?...Doc! \nShe steps back and Doc moves into her place as suddenly a leech-mouthed tentacle erupts from Cobb's waist.  It's razor sharp proboscis punctures Doc's chest right at the heart and the leach mouth with it's hundreds of teeth attaches with vacuum-like suction. \nDOC No! \nBut it is too late.  Willie falls back screaming as Cobb's gash RRRRRRRIPS OPEN!  THE FLESH OPENING GROTESQUELY FROM THE INSIDE AND INVERTS SCALY--SPREADING OVER COBB'S BODY LIKE A BUSHFIRE! \nCORRIDOR \"B\" \nCLOSE ON THE POOL OF BLOOD \nA huge shadow falls over the pool left by Beck.  A scaly tentacle suddenly whips across the floor.  The DEJESUS CREATURE!  WE SEE THE FLASH OF ITS APPENDAGES.  IT'S HEAD. AN EYE OPENS AND LOOKS UP. \nWHAT IT SEES  The outline of Beck lying \"hurt\" fifty feet away. \nIt starts down the corridor toward it's prey--Beck. \nON BECK \nA little behind him with the homemade flamethrower, Jones waits in the shadows.  Suddenly Beck hears something. \nBECK (whispers) I hear something. Don't fire until we're both in the Swamp. \nJones moves a little farther back. \nBECK(cont'd) Don't let him see you. \nJONES Don't worry... \nAs the Creature approaches WE SEE Beck stand up like a wounded animal.  He begins dragging his \"injured\" leg behind him as he retreats toward the Swamp.  THE FOOTSTEPS MOVE FASTER.  IT'S CLOSING! \nJONES (gravely) Look at this. \nBeck looks at Doc's computer screen. \nON SCREEN WE SEE DOC'S MESSAGE:  \"...hope that our sacrifice will mean that the human race will never know this awful mutation...\" \nWILLIE What is it? \nJONES The good doctor signed our death warrant. \nSUDDENLY THERE IS A TREMENDOUS BANGING ON THE DOOR!  LIKE A HUNDRED SLEDGEHAMMERS POUNDING THE HEAVY STEEL DOOR TRYING TO BREAK IT DOWN.  Jones readies his weapon but just as suddenly, the BANGING STOPS.  Beck, Willie and Jones all nervously exchange looks. \nWILLIE Well, at least we're safe inside here. \nJONES For how long? \nBeck slides behind the Console and quickly types in a message.  WE SEE IT ON THE SCREEN.  \"SHACK SIX REPORTING. PLEASE DISREGARD PREVIOUS MESSAGE---\" \nSUDDENLY MARTIN'S FACE APPEARS ON THE VIDEO SCREEN. \nMARTIN Thank goodness, you're still alive! \nJONES (yells nervously at the screen) Hey, man, you better get your ass out here right now and get us.  You hear me, motherfucker?  Right now! \nMartin smiles calmly back at the three of them. \nMARTIN Please relax, Mr. Jones.  Every- thing is under control.  Naturally, when we received Dr. Warren's message we were concerned but would never have deserted you. \nJones lets out a breath.  Willie stares straight at the screen. \nWILLIE When are you coming for us? \nMARTIN (smiles nervously) Well, that's the bad news. The typhoon did turn your way. (he looks at weather printout) Right now it is on a course-- \nJONES Just answer the question, man! When are you coming?! \nMARTIN (beat) Hopefully in the next 48 hours. \nBECK Forty-eight hours! \nMARTIN I realize you must have gone through hell-- \nJONES Gone?  Man, we're still here! \nMARTIN (firmly) I can't change the weather. Try to get some rest.  I'll keep you posted. \nHe turns off his screen and the picture in front of Beck, Jones and Willie goes blank. \nBECK He's right.  Why don't you get some rest.  I'll stand the first watch. \nTIME CUT TO \nCONTROL ROOM - LATER \nJones sits near the vent sound asleep, his weapon across his stomach.  Near him Willie lies still, eyes open.  She watches Beck across the room, standing at the window. \nHe stares outside into the darkness for a moment, then as if a thought suddenly occurs to him he looks at the blank computer screen. \nCLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN \n\"Request weather summaries January 14-21.\"  The cursor blinks back ominously then races across the screen.  \"FILE CLOSED.\" \nBECK (to himself) Martin, you asshole... \nSuddenly he hears a voice behind him. \nWILLIE They know, don't they? \nBECK (quietly) Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us. \nWILLIE Maybe they already have. \nShe moves into Doc's seat in front of the console and calls up the stock market program that Bowman was monitoring earlier. \nJones moves to the lead and turns down Corridor \"A.\" \nINT. CORRIDOR \"A\" \nThe SOUND of the power-wrench removing the bolts from the flooring.  The cover is removed and Beck and Jones peer down into the darkness.  Willie stands guard with the flame- thrower. \nON JONES  He peers into the darkness below.  He wasn't a big fan of the bilge even before the Creature, now he's scared shitless. \nBECK I'll go first. \nBefore Jones can protest Beck drops the ladder and climbs down into the dark bilge.  Jones waits till he's at the bottom, then starts down behind him.  Willie looks back. \nWILLIE Don't spend all day down there. \nJONES Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't. \nBILGE \nFrom somewhere in the darkness we hear the HISSING SOUND OF ESCAPING OXYGEN and the FAMILIAR RATTLE OF THE AIR SYSTEM. As soon as Jones reaches the bottom rung Beck shines a light into the eerie underground area. \nPipes run overhead and on the walls.  A broken electrical conduit sparks over their heads.  The floor is ankle deep in greasy water.  They start toward the noise. \nON WILLIE \nHer back is to the solid wall(outside wall).  Her eyes move from one end of the corridor to the other, not lingering long enough to distract her.  Sweat runs down her face and we hear another tremor in the Shack. \nWILLIE (to herself, calming herself) Okay, Williams...let's hear a tune. (beat, quietly at first) \"Off we go...into the wild blue yonder...\" \nANOTHER RUMBLE FROM THE SHACK causes her to pause.  She catches her breath and starts again. \nWILLIE(cont'd) \"...flying high into the sky...\" \nShe suddenly looks into the Main machine area (behind the wire mesh of the other wall).  Was it something moving? \nBILGE \nON BECK  He moves around a corner we recognize from before with Jones' and Cobb's repair.  Beck floods the area with light and the break in the line is visible.  The pipe has been torn from the wall, it is totally unreparable.  What's worse, electrical wires hang down, showering sparks into the water. \nJONES Jesus Christ... \nBECK Can you fix it? \nJONES No way... \nBECK Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think! \nJONES I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I-- \nSuddenly his eyes widen.  Beck sees this and turns.  In his light WE SEE THE GLINT OF LONG TEETH AND THE HUGE BLACK FRAME OF THE COBB/DOC CREATURE!  It's leech-like appendage whipping in front of it like an excited cat's tail.  Before it can strike, Jones pushes Beck out of the way and fires a blast of flame from his flamethrower.  The CREATURE SCREAMS and disappears. \nAs Beck falls his light lands in the bilge water and goes out sending the bilge into greater darkness. \nJONES I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?! \nBECK (standing) No. \nJones looks back at the ruptured pipe and suddenly has a thought. \nJONES The Swamp.  There's an over- ride switch in the Swamp. \nThey start for the ladder when WWWWHHHHHHHHIP! out of the darkness the appendage wraps like a bullwhip around Jones' arm.  The deadly proboscis, which stabbed Cobb, is poised like a dagger about to be plunged into the black man's thigh. \nJONES (screams) Ahhh! \nInstinctively Beck whips out the mining saw and severs the tentacle.  The unseen Creature's SCREAM echoes through the Bilge.  Beck grabs Jones by the arm and pulls him toward the ladder. \nBECK Hurry...Get out! \nQuickly they slosh toward the ladder and hole in the floor fifteen feet away, moving closer...ten...eight....then suddenly ANOTHER APPENDAGE thrusts between the rungs of the ladder at them.  Beck ducks and leaps to the side.  He is less than six feet from the Creature.  In the dim light WE SEE it wickedly bare its teeth. \nBeck's eyes go to the walls from one side to the other and spot the exposed power cable.  The Creature steps forward directly under the hole in the floor.  It is about to lunge when a voice from above distracts it. \nWILLIE'S VOICE(O.C.) Hey, you? \nBeck lays Jones head back against the life jacket.  For a moment.  Jones seems lifeless, then his eyes blink and squint against the sunlight.  Beck turns back to Willie and as he and Jones ride the next crest he gives her the \"thumbs-up.\" \nWILLIE(cont'd) (jubilant) The sun!  The sun! \nJones looks at Beck and grins. \nJONES What happened to that typhoon? \nCALM SEA - LATER \nBECK, WILLIE AND JONES cling to each other as they search the horizon. \nWILLIE Are you sure you saw something? \nJONES How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship. \nWILLIE Well, why haven't they answered our flares? \nBECK We'll fire one more, that leaves us one last one. \nBECK pulls the flare off his latex wet suit and fires it into the sky casting a comforting yellow glow over the dark water.  The light fades, Willie looks at Jones. \nWILLIE Are you okay, Jonesy? \nJONES (weakly) Tip top, Willie...tip top. \nWILLIE (testing him) Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson? \nJONES (tired, but with fight) Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...? \nThey both manage a weak laugh, then Beck sees something. \nBECK I'll be damned.  Look!...A flare! \nAs a small swell lifts them up we can see a tiny flare just fading against the sky. \nWILLIE It saw us! \nJONES Answer them and quit kicking me! \nWILLIE I'm not touching you! \nWHOOOOOOOOSH!  Beck fires another flare into the sky.  As the flare arcs downward, Willie feels another bump and for the first time sees the SHARKS CIRCLING THEM. \nWILLIE No...no, no, no. \nThe SHARKS tighten the circle as the flare fades. \nEXT. U.S. COASTGUARD SHIP'S BRIDGE - SAME \nA CAPTAIN watches the flare fade through his binoculars and speaks to someone O.S. \nCAPTAIN I thought you said you'd combed this area? \nHe lowers his binoculars AS WE WIDEN TO REVEAL MARTIN standing on the bridge.  He also lowers his binoculars and smiles coolly as he lies. \nMARTIN We did....Many times. \nCAPTAIN (looks at Martin then to a Lieutenant) Initiate rescue. \nWe hold on Martin's face as from \nTHE FORE DECK OF THE SHIP \nA rescue chopper with pontoons lifts off the deck and banks off toward the fading flare. \nOCEAN - SAME \nJones, Willie and Beck stay bunched close together. Suddenly Willie feels another bump. \nWILLIE (panicky) It hit me!  Where are they?! \nBECK I can't see them! \n", "test1_input": "BECK'S VOICE(RADIO) One minute. \nWillie hesitates at the junction and PUSHES OPEN the door on her left, SOMETHING HUGE BEHIND IT MOVES--IT'S SIXPACK.  His mechanical arms suddenly rise and in their grasp we see the ship's huge safe. \nSIXPACK (laughing) I'm rich, honey.  Rich! \nTHE SWAMP - LATER \nThe door to the Russian ship's safe stands open.  BANG! BANG!  Jones and DeJesus hammer safety deposit boxes with a chisel.  While the others watch, Sixpack pleads his case with Beck. \nSIXPACK It's all mine if I'm on report. Otherwise you gotta take me off report before you look at any more... Ain't that right, Cobbie? \nCOBB You're on your own, Sixpack, you fucked up everybody's day off... \nDeJesus pries off the top from the first safety deposit box and dumps the contents on the workbench...several wallets, wristwatches, a pocket watch, a wedding ring...Bowman who stands with a clipboard begins taking inventory. \nBOWMAN Personal effects... \nWILLIE (considering a watch) Timex... \nShe picks up something else, a pack of soggy chewing gum and tosses it to Cobb. \nWILLIE(cont'd) Here's something for you, Cobbie. \nJONES (checking a wallet) Russian money...Don't look like much. \nJones opens the next box and dumps it out onto the table...Life Savers candy, a postcard of a fat Russian woman in a bathing suit.  Bowman looks at it. \nBOWMAN (grinning to Sixpack) Yeah, I'd say you can retire with all this loot. \nSIXPACK Shut up. \nEveryone chuckles.  More papers and a small, book-shaped object wrapped in plastic.  Jones unwraps it.  It's a video tape.  He looks at the label. \nWILLIE What is it? \nJONES (reading) \"Debbie Does Dallas\"... (looks up and grins) Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it... \nDOC May I see it? \nJones hands it to Doc who looks at it. \nDOC (cont'd) It's a log of some sort. \nJones pries the lid off another box and dumps it out--Papers, more cheap watches. \nON SIXPACK  He notices something silver, the size of a paperback book, under a stack of papers.  Discreetly he covers the object with a piece of paper and slides it off the table out of sight. \nJones opens the last box, and something rolls across the table toward the edge and starts to drop when it is caught by DeJesus.  He holds it up and we see--a clear liquor bottle. \nWILLIE Vodka. \nCOBB What assholes, they lock booze in the safe. \nDEJESUS Probably confiscated.  No booze on board, same as us. \nDoc turns the bottle around in DeJesus' hand so he can read the label. \nDOC (eyeing the bottle) Stolichnaya. \nEveryone looks at Doc. \nCOBB You read Russian? \nDOC Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background... \nCobb stares at him a second then: \nCOBB Bullshit. \nDOC (grins) ...and a Russian grandmother... \nBeck ignores them and addresses Bowman. \n", "test1_true": "He lifts the bottle of Stolie out of DeJesus' hands. \nBECK(cont'd) ...except this...it goes in my safe. \nA disappointed crew watches Beck leave with the bottle.  Doc stops him. \nDOC (to Beck, holding up the videotape) You mind if I take a look at this? \nBECK (leaving) Be my guest. \nRING CORRIDOR - LATER \nThe gloomy corridor outside the Infirmary.  It is empty, silent.  Suddenly the door to the Infirmary opens slightly and Bowman peeks out.  Seeing the corridor is empty she slips out with a a manila folder. \nDORMITORY - SAME \nBowman hands the envelope to DeJesus, who's grinning delightedly. \nDEJESUS You got 'em! \nSixpack and Jones are there too.  Sixpack scowls. \nSIXPACK What good's the kid's med records anyway! \nDEJESUS Watch and learn, amigo... \nCONTROL ROOM - LATER \nCLOSE ON MONITOR SCREEN \nWe see a thin, bearded man in his late fifties, a RUSSIAN SHIP'S CAPTAIN talking to the camera in Russian.  The tape is of poor quality and water spotted. \nDOC'S VOICE(O.S.) (translating) Another party last night.  More Vodka.  The infirmary is filled as it is.  I confiscate what I can, but I know the Government Observers have more... \nSuddenly, the captain hears a noise off-screen and goes to the camera and turns it off.  The tape goes blank. \nON DOC \nHe stops the tape and presses another button on the console. WILLIE'S VIDEO of the huge hole in the hull of the ship appears on another screen. \nDOC(cont'd) See that gash?  The way the edges protrude inward is like from a torpedo explosion.  It couldn't have come from within. Like an accident. \nHe looks back at Beck who we see is sitting behind him, and has also been watching the tape.  Beck looks at Doc and shrugs. \nBECK What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious? \nDOC These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes. \nBECK What mistakes? (he shakes his head wearily) Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check. \nHe gets up and goes to the door.  Doc watches him. \nDOC I did.  They have no record of the wreck. (beat) The Marshal Goloviev is now on a tour in the Baltic Sea. \nBeck stops.  This is a mystery. \nCLOSE ON COMBINATION LOCK/ BECK'S QUARTERS - SAME \nFingers fiddle with the combination.  He pulls on the handle.  The safe doesn't budge. \nDEJESUS (whisper) It's not the phone number... \nWe pull back to see that DeJesus is alone in Beck's darkened quarters, he talks to the P.A.  Suddenly we hear BOWMAN'S VOICE over the intercom. \nBOWMAN'S VOICE (on intercom) Okay, try the social security number... \nDeJesus puts his fingers back, on the safe dial. \nDEJESUS Okay, give it to me... \nINTERCUT WITH BOWMAN IN DORM. \n", "test2_input": "Beck looks up and they lock eyes. \nBECK You think I should hang around more with the crew? \nWILLIE Well, I always heard you don't \"learn\" leadership, you earn it. (beat) How did you know they'd get into the vodka? \nBeck looks up from his clipboard and smiles. \nBECK I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done. \nWILLIE (smiles) Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir. \nINT. MESS/ BLACKBOARD - MORNING \nSCREECH!  The chalk shrieks across the blackboard, making a \"1\" over the words \"Days Till Pickup.\" \nJones looks up from his cereal at Bowman, the culprit with the chalk. \nJONES Puuleeeeze... \nINT. DORMITORY - SAME \nDeJesus puts on his wet suit which goes under his large mechanical suit and gets ready to join the others in the mess.  He notices Sixpack's privacy door is still closed and bangs on it. \nDEJESUS Hey, Sixpack...Rise and shine amigo... \nThere is no answer.  Carefully he opens the door and is surprised to find it empty. \nINT. INFIRMARY - SAME \nCLOSE ON Sixpack's eye.  We pull back to see it is being examined by Doc who frowns. \nDOC Let's see your tongue. \nSixpack obliges as Beck enters. \nBECK What's wrong? \nDOC Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know. \nSIXPACK Well, it ain't!  It feels a thousand times worse. \nDOC Where? \nSIXPACK I...I dunno.  I just feel... wrong. \nDOC Take off your shirt. \nSixpack pulls off his shirt.  Doc frowns in surprise. \nWHAT HE SEES:  SIXPACK'S TORSO  There are strange black areas, each of them an inch in diameter. \nDOC (cont'd) (concerned) How long...how long have you had these? \nSIXPACK (surprised, scared) Shit, Doc...I didn't know I had them. \nDoc peers closely at the skin where it's discolored.  It's a different texture.  Beck watches as Doc touches a spot and Sixpack screams in agony.  Doc and Beck lock eyes. \nBECK'S QUARTERS - SAME \nCLOSE ON MARTIN on Beck's video monitor.  He is drinking a cup of coffee. \nMARTIN ...as long as you know it's not in your contract. \nBECK I know that. \nMARTIN Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision... (he chuckles) Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself... \nBeck interrupts impatiently. \nBECK How's the weather for pickup tomorrow? \nMARTIN (looking at a report, then up at Beck) Beautiful. \n", "test2_true": "The crew members climb into their suits. \nCOBB Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it. \nDEJESUS (angrily) He's tanking on us... \nWILLIE No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration... \nJONES Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about \"whys,\" they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month. \nDEJESUS (convinced) 'Cocksucker's tanking on us... \nSuddenly all eyes go to the door, Beck enters. \nBECK (to DeJesus) No, he's really sick...He won't be going out today. \nThe crew increases its bitching... \nCOBB There goes our quota... \nBOWMAN Thirty days, right down the toilet... \nBeck ignores them and goes to the control rack which sends the suits around the room and pushes number 8--his suit. DeJesus and Jones share a look.  Bowman and Willie watch him carefully.  As Beck's suit stops in front of him the room is quiet, they can't believe their eyes.  Awkwardly, Beck tries to get into his suit.  Cobb breaks the silence. \nCOBB Excuse me, sir... \nBECK Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb? \nCOBB No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand? \nBeck sees he's sincere, then looks at the others and Willie. She nods slightly.  Beck turns back to Cobb. \nBECK (beat) Thanks... \nINT. THE INFIRMARY - SAME \nDoc and Sixpack.  Doc takes a blood sample, seals it and opens a cabinet under the sink where a supply of blood is stored in a refrigerated unit.  The plastic bags of blood are labeled with the various crew members' names. \nSixpack watches him from the examination table.  He is shivering violently and scared. \nSIXPACK (he's losing it) Please, Doc...I'm cold...I hurt... \nWe see a change in Doc's demeanor.  He is suddenly needed and it has touched something in him and we see him rising to the challenge. \nDOC I'm just going to take a tiny piece of skin to look at under the microscope...Afterwards I'll give you a sedative. \nSkillfully Doc takes a skin sample.  Sixpack screams. \nVIEW THROUGH THE MICROSCOPE \nAn enlarged view of the cells in alarmingly hyperactivity. We see it literally spreading before our eyes. \nON DOC \nHe leans back from the microscope.  There is awe on his face for the first time since first year medical studies--and there is fear of the unknown.  He looks over his shoulder at Sixpack, his shivering has stopped, he lies still on the table. \nUNDERWATER \nLights move in the blackness, but there is an order to the actions and a crispness to the voices.  People doing work that is moving sharply.  Pride in what they're doing. \nDEJESUS Okay, number 23's full. \nBECK Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one. \nJONES Yes sir... \nBOWMAN Hook's on 24... \nBECK Let's have her... \nThe Container transporters fill with compressed air and lift the container as the miners guide it to the track... \n", "test3_input": "THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE INTONES:  \"Five minutes to implosion.\"  And we feel it happening: \nTHE BILGE WATER ON THE FLOOR OF THE SWAMP RIPPLES WITH THE VIBRATIONS \nTHE WALLS SHAKE \nTHE HUGE METAL SUITS ROCK LIKE CLOTHES ON A CLOTHES LINE. ONE FALLS AND CRASHES INTO THE WATER \nJONES throws open the control panel and grabs the red handled emergency air switch, but he can only move it half way!  It is jammed by the pressure. \nJONES It won't go! \nWillie grabs it with him, but even together it is not enough.  THE HANDLE BREAKS OFF IN THEIR HANDS! \nSTEAM JETS WHIP DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE! \nTHE WATER AT THEIR FEET NOW BOILS FROM VIBRATION! \nTHE FEMALE VOICE INTONES:  \"Four minutes...\" \nBECK TURNS AND SEES THE SUITS IN THE LOCK \nHe grabs Willie and pushes her toward the Lock where her suit hangs. \nBECK The suits!  Get in them! \nWillie moves quickly but Jones doesn't. \nJONES The suits!  Are you crazy! How're we going to get to the surface? \nBeck yanks open the equipment locker revealing TANKS OF COMPRESSED AIR AND DEFLATED CONTAINER TRANSPORTERS. \nBECK Like this. \nHe looks up at Jones who grins with renewed hope and they begin pulling the equipment out. \nBECK(cont'd) Get them in the Lock! \nJones and Beck drag the tanks and the parachute-like Container transporters to the lock. \nON WILLIE  She climbs into her suit and activates her generator.  Instantly her Vital Signs spring to life around the perimeter of her helmet. \nTHE FEMALE VOICE TREMBLES FROM THE VIBRATIONS...\"Three minutes...to...implosion...\" \nBeck and Jones throw the last of the supplies onto the elevator and Beck holds out the SEISMIC TOOL Jones tried to arm himself with earlier.  He takes the tool from Beck and sticks it in the vest of his wet suit. \nThen suddenly he sees that there are only two suits in the Lock.  Beck will have to wait on his to move along the track to the Lock. \nJONES Your suit, Becky! \nBECK Just get in yours! \nJones climbs onto the Lock platform and slides into his suit. \nBeck hits the Suit track button and his suit begins moving along the track toward the Lock.  A suit turns the corner from the storage room followed by one labeled BECK. \nBeck looks at the walls, they're shaking harder.  He moves along the suit rack when suddenly THE CREATURE BURSTS FROM BEHIND THE SUITS SHATTERING THEM LIKE AN EXPLOSION!  A HUGE TENTACLE HURLS TOWARD BECK LIKE A SPEAR. \nBECK ducks just in time, grabbing a fire ax and chopping off the appendage.  Another tentacle jabs for Beck. \nWILLIE (screams) Look out! \nBut it is too late.  It knocks the ax from Beck's hand and sends him to the floor.  Beck looks up at the Lock in time to see Jones seal himself into his suit. \nJONES/RADIO I'm in. \nBECK (to the others) Go! \nWILLIE/RADIO No! \nTHE CREATURE APPROACHES BECK \nBeck looks at the others one last time. \n", "test3_true": "Jones hits the elevator button and the Lock closes as the elevator sends them down without Beck. \nBECK stands and arms himself with a mining drill, which he swings at the Creature driving it back.  As Beck gets the upper hand, the Creature turns its hideous face and Beck freezes.  There attached to the back of the Creature's head is the grotesque face of DeJesus! \nDeJesus' eyes suddenly blink.  He's still alive!  His lips tremble in agony. \nDEJESUS Kill me...Kill me! \nBeck, momentarily stopped by the face, lunges forward with the drill and embeds it in the side of the Creature. \nAs the Creature falls back hurt, Beck looks up at the lock elevator as it returns--IT IS EMPTY--The others have made it out!  His suit continues down the track and stops in the Lock.  He still has to make it, if he can just get there! \nTHE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE SOUNDS:  \"One minute to implosion...\" \nBeck races to the Lock and starts to climb into the suit. His arms slide into place, his legs drop into the heavy metal shell and as he seals up the back he activates the generator. \nBECK'S POV.  His vital signs light up around the perimeter of his helmet, but he sees something else--the Creature charges toward the Lock--its arm reaches out to yank Beck out of the elevator!  Instinctively, Beck swings his motorized leg into the Creature's snarling mouth, knocking it backwards and stunning it long enough for Beck to hit the elevator button.  BUT IT DOESN'T WORK! \nBECK No! \nHe hits again, still nothing! \nTHE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE...\"Nineteen, eighteen...\"  Her voice begins to quiver. \nBECK POUNDS ON THE BUTTON AND LOOKS UP JUST AS THE CREATURE DIVES FOR HIM, ITS HUGE SCALY HAND GRABBING HIM AROUND BECK'S LEG! \nCLOSE ON THE ELVATOR BUTTON  Beck pounds it one last time and NNNNNNNNNNNN! \nTHE LOCK CLOSES, CRUSHING THE CREATURE AS IT FLUSHES BECK OUTSIDE SECONDS BEFORE THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE COLLAPSES WITH IMPLOSION AND SUDDENLY EXPLODES IN A HUGE SHUDDER OF ENERGY! \nUNDERWATER - LATER \nWHOOSH!  A parachute-like Container Transporter zoom toward the surface.  A heavy-suited crew member flashes past us. Its helmet light pierces the darkness, then disappears.  A moment later another Transporter follows, racing out of the darkness after the first. \nBECK'S POV  We see the vital signs lit in a ring around his helmet.  The depth gauge races past with blinding speed as he moves closer to the surface. \nWILLIE'S POV  She tilts her head upwards.  She snaps off her light and sees instead of black, a lighter gray, then suddenly faint traces of light in the water above her.  At first it seems like her eyes are playing tricks on her, then we see it again--a glimmer of light. \nWILLIE(RADIO) Light.  Beck, I see light! \nON BECK \nHe follows her look.  Light is coming fast, brightening as they rise.  The LED numbers inside their helmets click off...\"125, 100, 75...\" \nBECK(RADIO) Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit... \nWILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO) Roger. \nWILLIE'S POV  Her numbers count down \"....70, 60, 50, 40...\" \nWILLIE(RADIO) Ejecting. \nShe yanks at the handle on the chest plate and WHOOSH!  The plate bursts open and reveals a second interior handle.  Her hand gropes for it. \nSUNLIGHT IS STREAMING DOWN THROUGH THE WATER AS SHE RUSHES UPWARD. \nWHOOSH!  The helmet and torso of the suit are blown open as she pulls the second lever detaching her from the balloons. \nNo longer oxygen supported or being pulled upward, Willie frees herself from the heavy suit and swims to the surface. \nSUDDENLY SHE BREAKS THE SURFACE AND CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF THE SUN, DAZZLING THROUGH A MILLION DROPLETS OF WATER AS A HUGE SWELL CARRIES HER UP EVEN HIGHER. \nThen she's underwater again, struggling desperately to pull the tab on the life jacket around her neck.  Suddenly a MALE HAND GRABS THE TAB FOR HER AND PULLS.  She looks up at Beck. \nWILLIE We made it! \nBECK Where's Jones? \nHolding onto each other Willie and Beck ride a swell.  At the crest WE SEE JONES in the trough below, face down.  Beck breaks away from Willie and swims through the waves to reach Jones.  Reaching him Beck pulls his face out of the water and inflates his life jacket. \nWILLIE Is he okay? \n"}

{"test1_input": "BOWMAN (reading off of Beck's forms) Two...twelve...ninety-six. \nSIXPACK (scoffingly) You guys are so full of shit... Who's going to use their birthday... \nDEJESUS VOICE (over intercom) BINGO! \nSIXPACK (suddenly sitting up) Like I said, that bottle's mine! \nCONTROL ROOM - SAME \nON Beck at the door and Doc. \nDOC I want your permission to check that vodka. \nBeck looks at him.  It is obvious that he doesn't trust Doc, with the vodka, but he's diplomatic. \nBECK This is a mining shack, not a lab, Doc.  If there's something strange with the vodka it's safe till we get back. \nUPPER RING CORRIDOR \nON COBB  Standing watch for DeJesus.  Suddenly the door to the Control room opens and Beck walks out.  Cobb grabs a walkie-talkie. \nCOBB Beck's coming. \nBECK'S QUARTERS/ ON DEJESUS \nHe hears Cobb and freezes.  He looks around--the cramped quarters don't offer much in the way of hiding places. \nINTERCUT WITH BOWMAN AND OTHERS IN DORMATORY \nThey react similarly to the sound of Cobb on the P.A. \nON COBB AND BECK/ CORRIDOR \nBeck stops outside his door and sees Cobb. \nBECK Something wrong, Cobb? \nCOBB (struggling) Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir... \nBECK What's wrong with it? \nCOBB (thinking fast) ...I'd really have to show it to you. \nBECK (beat) All right... \nCobb smiles, he can't believe his luck, then Beck holds up the videotape. \nBECK(cont'd) ...Just let me put this in my safe... \nBefore Cobb can react Beck opens the door to his quarters and steps inside. \nBECK'S QUARTERS  WE SEE no sign of DeJesus.  Cobb follows into the room, looking carefully around for sign of DeJesus. \nIn the mirror to Beck's bathroom, Cobb spots DeJesus pressing against the wall.  Cobb suddenly starts to sweat bullets.  Beck quickly unlocks the safe, opens it, and puts the videotape right next to the bottle of Vodka. \nWe see Cobb's reaction.  Beck turns. \nBECK Something wrong? \nCobb shakes his head weakly and starts to follow Beck out, he sneaks a look back at DeJesus in the shadows who gives him a thumbs up. \nMESS - LATER \nFive specimen cups filled with vodka.  Bowman takes hers and looks at it questioningly.  Cobb watches the door for signs of the officers. \nBOWMAN Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups? \nJONES Aw, loosen up, Bowman... (he looks over and notices Willie) Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you. \nWillie shakes her head. \nWILLIE No, thanks.  I've got my blood tests in three days. \n", "test1_true": "WILLIE After my astronaut training physical, then I'll tie one on. \nSIXPACK Forget space cadet, I'll drink hers. \nCOBB Hey what happens it he goes back and finds the bottle missing? \nDEJESUS He won't... \nHe holds up a plastic IV bag filled with clear liquid. \nDEJESUS(cont'd) I poured the vodka in here. \nCobb, Jones, DeJesus, Bowman, and Sixpack grin and clink glasses, then knock back their vodka.  Afterwards we get their reactions. \nJONES:  Looks concerned. BOWMAN:  Shakes her head, something's wrong. DEJESUS:  Can't get the taste off his tongue. COBB:  Seems totally satisfied. SIXPACK:  who has held the liquid in his mouth savoring it, suddenly spits the vodka out. \nSIXPACK Shit!  It's water! \nJONES Beck switched it! \nDEJESUS Can you beat that?  The sonof- abitch doesn't trust us! \nWillie grins at her co-workers and Beck's move and jogs out into the corridor.  Sixpack disgustedly tosses his shot glass away and leaves. \nSIXPACK That little turd.  If I ever get the chance I'll fix his ass. \nThe others put down their glasses disappointedly except Bowman.  She watches Sixpack. \nDORMITORY \nSIXPACK'S BUNK  He closes his privacy door and hesitates as if listening for the others, then he removes a silver flask with Cyrillic lettering--the silver object he palmed in the Swamp--and smiles as he takes a long pull.  Suddenly WHAM! \nThe Privacy door to Sixpack's bunk is slammed open. Startled he turns startled to see--BOWMAN. \nBOWMAN Didn't I ever tell you vodka was my favorite drink? \nShe holds out her glass.  Sixpack looks around the Dorm, it's empty, then grins sheepishly and pours her a shot. \nCORRIDOR \"B\" \nON WILLIE  She is jogging through the corridors.  Suddenly there is a GREAT GROANING NOISE.  Willie stops and looks through the steel mesh wall into the machine floor.  The dark shapes of the machines move monstrously in the dim light.  The GROANING ends and she jogs on to the Swamp. \nAs she passes the door she notices the light and stops.  Beck stands with a clipboard by an equipment cabinet filled with the parachute-like Container Transporters we saw outside. He sees her. \nBECK That was a loud one wasn't it? \nWILLIE After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it. \nShe moves into the Swamp and goes to the Lift Lock, stopping under one of the ladders she leaps up and grabs a metal rung above her and begins doing her chin-ups as Beck watches her lean body easily doing the exercises. \nBECK (watching her) How's astronaut training? \nWILLIE Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others? \nBECK No.  I'm just being friendly. \nWILLIE (beat) Good...It's going good. \nBeck tries to concentrate on his inventory, but continues to watch Willie's sexy, athletic body. \nBECK Whatever made you want to do a tour down here? \nWILLIE I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps... (she watches him) Why are you here? \nBECK Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something. \nWILLIE Has it helped? \nBeck shrugs. \nWILLIE I guess there's not a lot of adventure in the Control Room. \n", "test1_id": 1242, "test2_input": "Beck looks up and they lock eyes. \nBECK You think I should hang around more with the crew? \nWILLIE Well, I always heard you don't \"learn\" leadership, you earn it. (beat) How did you know they'd get into the vodka? \nBeck looks up from his clipboard and smiles. \nBECK I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done. \nWILLIE (smiles) Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir. \nINT. MESS/ BLACKBOARD - MORNING \nSCREECH!  The chalk shrieks across the blackboard, making a \"1\" over the words \"Days Till Pickup.\" \nJones looks up from his cereal at Bowman, the culprit with the chalk. \nJONES Puuleeeeze... \nINT. DORMITORY - SAME \nDeJesus puts on his wet suit which goes under his large mechanical suit and gets ready to join the others in the mess.  He notices Sixpack's privacy door is still closed and bangs on it. \nDEJESUS Hey, Sixpack...Rise and shine amigo... \nThere is no answer.  Carefully he opens the door and is surprised to find it empty. \nINT. INFIRMARY - SAME \nCLOSE ON Sixpack's eye.  We pull back to see it is being examined by Doc who frowns. \nDOC Let's see your tongue. \nSixpack obliges as Beck enters. \nBECK What's wrong? \nDOC Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know. \nSIXPACK Well, it ain't!  It feels a thousand times worse. \nDOC Where? \nSIXPACK I...I dunno.  I just feel... wrong. \nDOC Take off your shirt. \nSixpack pulls off his shirt.  Doc frowns in surprise. \nWHAT HE SEES:  SIXPACK'S TORSO  There are strange black areas, each of them an inch in diameter. \nDOC (cont'd) (concerned) How long...how long have you had these? \nSIXPACK (surprised, scared) Shit, Doc...I didn't know I had them. \nDoc peers closely at the skin where it's discolored.  It's a different texture.  Beck watches as Doc touches a spot and Sixpack screams in agony.  Doc and Beck lock eyes. \nBECK'S QUARTERS - SAME \nCLOSE ON MARTIN on Beck's video monitor.  He is drinking a cup of coffee. \nMARTIN ...as long as you know it's not in your contract. \nBECK I know that. \nMARTIN Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision... (he chuckles) Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself... \nBeck interrupts impatiently. \nBECK How's the weather for pickup tomorrow? \nMARTIN (looking at a report, then up at Beck) Beautiful. \n", "test2_true": "The crew members climb into their suits. \nCOBB Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it. \nDEJESUS (angrily) He's tanking on us... \nWILLIE No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration... \nJONES Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about \"whys,\" they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month. \nDEJESUS (convinced) 'Cocksucker's tanking on us... \nSuddenly all eyes go to the door, Beck enters. \nBECK (to DeJesus) No, he's really sick...He won't be going out today. \nThe crew increases its bitching... \nCOBB There goes our quota... \nBOWMAN Thirty days, right down the toilet... \nBeck ignores them and goes to the control rack which sends the suits around the room and pushes number 8--his suit. DeJesus and Jones share a look.  Bowman and Willie watch him carefully.  As Beck's suit stops in front of him the room is quiet, they can't believe their eyes.  Awkwardly, Beck tries to get into his suit.  Cobb breaks the silence. \nCOBB Excuse me, sir... \nBECK Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb? \nCOBB No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand? \nBeck sees he's sincere, then looks at the others and Willie. She nods slightly.  Beck turns back to Cobb. \nBECK (beat) Thanks... \nINT. THE INFIRMARY - SAME \nDoc and Sixpack.  Doc takes a blood sample, seals it and opens a cabinet under the sink where a supply of blood is stored in a refrigerated unit.  The plastic bags of blood are labeled with the various crew members' names. \nSixpack watches him from the examination table.  He is shivering violently and scared. \nSIXPACK (he's losing it) Please, Doc...I'm cold...I hurt... \nWe see a change in Doc's demeanor.  He is suddenly needed and it has touched something in him and we see him rising to the challenge. \nDOC I'm just going to take a tiny piece of skin to look at under the microscope...Afterwards I'll give you a sedative. \nSkillfully Doc takes a skin sample.  Sixpack screams. \nVIEW THROUGH THE MICROSCOPE \nAn enlarged view of the cells in alarmingly hyperactivity. We see it literally spreading before our eyes. \nON DOC \nHe leans back from the microscope.  There is awe on his face for the first time since first year medical studies--and there is fear of the unknown.  He looks over his shoulder at Sixpack, his shivering has stopped, he lies still on the table. \nUNDERWATER \nLights move in the blackness, but there is an order to the actions and a crispness to the voices.  People doing work that is moving sharply.  Pride in what they're doing. \nDEJESUS Okay, number 23's full. \nBECK Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one. \nJONES Yes sir... \nBOWMAN Hook's on 24... \nBECK Let's have her... \nThe Container transporters fill with compressed air and lift the container as the miners guide it to the track... \n", "test2_id": 1243, "test3_input": "Beck lays Jones head back against the life jacket.  For a moment.  Jones seems lifeless, then his eyes blink and squint against the sunlight.  Beck turns back to Willie and as he and Jones ride the next crest he gives her the \"thumbs-up.\" \nWILLIE(cont'd) (jubilant) The sun!  The sun! \nJones looks at Beck and grins. \nJONES What happened to that typhoon? \nCALM SEA - LATER \nBECK, WILLIE AND JONES cling to each other as they search the horizon. \nWILLIE Are you sure you saw something? \nJONES How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship. \nWILLIE Well, why haven't they answered our flares? \nBECK We'll fire one more, that leaves us one last one. \nBECK pulls the flare off his latex wet suit and fires it into the sky casting a comforting yellow glow over the dark water.  The light fades, Willie looks at Jones. \nWILLIE Are you okay, Jonesy? \nJONES (weakly) Tip top, Willie...tip top. \nWILLIE (testing him) Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson? \nJONES (tired, but with fight) Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...? \nThey both manage a weak laugh, then Beck sees something. \nBECK I'll be damned.  Look!...A flare! \nAs a small swell lifts them up we can see a tiny flare just fading against the sky. \nWILLIE It saw us! \nJONES Answer them and quit kicking me! \nWILLIE I'm not touching you! \nWHOOOOOOOOSH!  Beck fires another flare into the sky.  As the flare arcs downward, Willie feels another bump and for the first time sees the SHARKS CIRCLING THEM. \nWILLIE No...no, no, no. \nThe SHARKS tighten the circle as the flare fades. \nEXT. U.S. COASTGUARD SHIP'S BRIDGE - SAME \nA CAPTAIN watches the flare fade through his binoculars and speaks to someone O.S. \nCAPTAIN I thought you said you'd combed this area? \nHe lowers his binoculars AS WE WIDEN TO REVEAL MARTIN standing on the bridge.  He also lowers his binoculars and smiles coolly as he lies. \nMARTIN We did....Many times. \nCAPTAIN (looks at Martin then to a Lieutenant) Initiate rescue. \nWe hold on Martin's face as from \nTHE FORE DECK OF THE SHIP \nA rescue chopper with pontoons lifts off the deck and banks off toward the fading flare. \nOCEAN - SAME \nJones, Willie and Beck stay bunched close together. Suddenly Willie feels another bump. \nWILLIE (panicky) It hit me!  Where are they?! \nBECK I can't see them! \n", "test3_true": "JONES All right!  I've had enough of this shit!  You want meat, motherfucker?  Come on, eat me, sucker, try some dark meat! \nHe pushes away from the group despite Beck's attempt to stop him. \nJONES(cont'd) (taunting sharks) What's wrong you snout-nosed bastards?  My meat too tough for you?! \nAmazingly the sharks begin to disappear.  Willie and Beck watch stunned.  Even Jones is surprised. \nJONES(cont'd) (to Willie and Beck) Whoa!  Did you see those fools run?  They know whose boss. \nHe jabs his arm upward in triumph and for the first time WE SEE a gash across his forearm. \nUNDERWATER POV \nAs Jones crows triumphantly, WE SUDDENLY SEE HIS WET SUIT RIPPING ALONG HIS THIGHS! \nSURFACE/OCEAN \nJones is chortling, suddenly his smile vanishes, something is happening... \nWE hear the DRONE OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER...THUMP, THUMP, THUMP...The blades of the helicopter sound out over the waves.  It's lights are visible.  Willie and Beck wave frantically as Jones drifts closer to them! \nUNDERWATER \nJONES' LEGS  His wet suit is now completely split open and WE SEE THE BLACK SCALES SPREADING! \nTHE HELICOPTER \nhovers over the group below and lands on the water.  Its blades beat the surface into waves.  The WINCH OPERATOR hurls out a rescue harness and Beck helps Willie into the ring.  He CLICKS the fastener and suddenly they both lock eyes.  Before Willie can say anything Beck falls back and signals the Winch operator who begins hauling her to safety. Immediately Beck locks back at Jones and extends his arm. \nBECK Jonesy...Give me your hand! \nWILLIE reaches the helicopter and quickly climbs out of the harness.  The Winch operator throws it back across the water where \nBECK grabs the harness. \nBECK C'mon, Jones! \nJones reaches out his hand.  He is almost there WHEN SUDDENLY RISING OUT OF THE WATER BEHIND THEM IS THE SIXPACK/BOWMAN CREATURE IN ALL ITS HIDEOUS GLORY!  HUGE AND GRUESOME, ITS LONG TEETH GLIMMER IN THE LIGHT.  IT GOES FOR BECK BUT JONES MOVES BETWEEN THEM. \nBECK Jonesy, No! \nJONES Get out of here, Becky! \nThe Creature grabs Jones and pulls him violently under. Beck watches horrified as his friend disappears.  Numbed he clips the rescue harness around him when suddenly, WE SEE a boiling of water where Jones disappeared...bubbles rising...and then Jones' bloody and tattered life vest bobs to the surface several feet away from Beck. \nBeck reaches out for it just as the Creature appears again! It turns and focuses on Beck.  Beck keeps going for the life vest as the Creature starts for him. \nON HELICOPTER \nThe Winch operator and Willie watch in horror as the Creature bears down on Beck. \nWINCH OPERATOR Is he in the harness! \nCLOSE ON JONES' TATTERED VEST  Beck reaches it.  His fingers wrap around the bicycle pump-like, seismic tool in Jones' vest pocket.  The Creature is right on top of him! \nCHUNK, CHUNK, Beck cocks it like a pump shotgun as tentacles rise wickedly out of the water and wrap around Beck's body in a death grip.  It's horrible mouth starts to open. \nBECK C'mon, motherfucker open up! \nThe Creature's mouth widens and as it starts to strike Beck thrusts the seismic tool into its gaping maw and is suddenly pulled from behind--out of the creature's grasp!  The rescue cable is taut!  The helicopter is taking off! \nBECK'S POV/ RISING SHOT.  Beck rises suddenly out of the water, the Creature growing instantly smaller below him until BOOM! the Seismic device explodes in the Sixpack/Bowman Creature, blowing it to bits across the ocean surface!  The shock wave sends the helicopter banking off toward the ship with Beck safely attached by cable below it. The winch operator pulls him in. \nEXT. COAST GUARD SHIP - LATER \nBeck, dressed now in crisp white clothes, stands on deck of the ship.  He glances occasionally at a door nearby marked INFIRMARY, then looks up as the Captain approaches and shakes his hand. \nCAPTAIN Mr. Beck, I understand you passed your physical with flying colors.  And Ms. Williams? \nBECK (worried) I don't know yet, she's still in there. \n", "test3_id": 1244}

ROSE (too sternly) Because I said so. 
Angry, Oscar sits down on the steps. 
135   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                          135 
The phone next to Joe's Lazy Boy is off the hook. 
ROSE Dad! 
Rose walks briskly through the house. Urgency mounts with each step. 
ROSE Dad! Daddy! 
Rose throws the bathroom door open in a panic. 
136   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY                             136 
Joe scoops rotten shrimp from the bathtub with an empty fancy corn canister and dumps them into a garbage can. 
Rose recoils at the intense smell. 
JOE I'm busy here. 
He tries to swing the door shut but Rose stops it. Steps in. 
ROSE Damn it dad, you scared me. 
Sweat drips down Joe's face. He continues his labor and avoids looking at Rose. 
JOE Those snotty restaurant fucks wouldn't buy my shrimp. Some bullshit about health codes or whatever. I don't believe that shit for a second. 
ROSE God, dad what were you-- 
He holds up a finger.

JOE Don't. Don't start with me. (Pause) Bastards completely shut me out. They got their own little cartel. Little restaurant mafia. I bet they screwed with my car too. I wouldn't put it past `em. Bunch of shady mother fuckers. 
Rose leans against the door and watches her father. A wet slap punctuates each new deposit into the garbage. 
ROSE I need you to watch Oscar. 
Another load of slimy shrimp smacks the garbage. 
JOE I can't. 
ROSE What do you mean you can't? 
JOE I can't watch Oscar today Rose. 
ROSE I'm in a real bind here. 
JOE Yeah, well it's hard, isn't it? Raising a kid on your own. Try two. 
137   EXT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - DAY                                    137 
Rose and Oscar get out of the Sentra and march toward the store. 
138   INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - DAY                                    138 
Winston sees Rose and Oscar through the window and returns his attention to the model plane before him. 
Rose and Oscar enter. 
WINSTON You look nice.

ROSE Thanks. 
Winston finishes gluing the piece and looks up.

ROSE I was wondering if Oscar could hang out here for a little while. 
Winston looks nervous. He looks at Oscar. 
ROSE I've got this baby shower to go to and Norah's working a job and my dad's incapacitated... Do you mind? 
WINSTON I guess not. 
ROSE You're a lifesaver. 
WINSTON You did your hair different. 
ROSE You like it? 
Winston nods. 
ROSE All right. Be good. I'll pick him up in a few hours when I'm done. 
Rose leaves. Oscar and Winston are left on their own. Winston forces a smile. Oscar does not reciprocate. Winston turns and walks to the back room.

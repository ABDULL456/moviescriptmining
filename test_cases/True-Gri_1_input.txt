We hear the smack of lips releasing bottleneck, and a wet breath. 
Rooster . . . You could not hit a man at three hundred yards if the gun was resting on Gibraltar. 
LeBoeuf The Sharp'sh carbine izh an inshtrument of uncanny power and precizhun. 
Rooster I have no doubt that the gun is sound. 
Silence. 
LeBoeuf shrugs. 
MORNING 
Wide: three riders leave the cabin single-file. 
Jump in: pushing Mattie, who rides last in line. LeBoeuf is in front of her. Rooster leads, head tipping momentarily back to swig from a bottle. 
He then half-hums, half-scats a tune. 
Mattie twists to look behind. 
Her point-of-view: pulling away from the cabin, against the wall of which the four dead men are now semi-drifted over with snow. Rooster's humming has stopped and we hear his voice: 
Rooster That was "Johnny in the Low Ground." There are very few fiddle tunes I have not heard. Once heard they are locked in my mind forever. It is a sadness to me that I have sausage fingers that cannot crowd onto a fretboard--little fat girls at a cotillion. "Soldier's Joy"! 
He launches into another song, interrupted by the slosh of liquid as he takes a drink. Mattie looks forward again and LeBoeuf turns to look back at her. He keeps his voice low: 
LeBoeuf I don't believe he shlept. 
Still without looking back, Rooster projects: 
Rooster Fort Smith is a healthy distance, LeBoeuf, but I would encourage the creature you ride to try to make it in a day. Out here a one-armed man looks like easy prey. 
LeBoeuf And a one-eyed man--who can't shshoodt? Why don't you tshurn back, Khoghburn? 
Rooster I will do fine. 
He twists around to gaily hector LeBoeuf: 
. . . I know where the Parmalee's claim is. I am uninjured, I am provisioned--and we agreed to separate. 
LeBoeuf In conscschiensh you cannot shite our agreement. You are the pershon who shshot me. 
Mattie Mr. LeBoeuf has a point, Marshal. It is an unfair leg-up in any competition to shoot your opposite number. 
Rooster God damn it! I don't accept it as a given that I did shoot LeBoeuf. There was plenty of guns going off. 
LeBoeuf I heard a rifle and felt the ball. You mishshed your shshodt, Khoghburn, admit it. You are more handicapped without the eye than I without the arm. 
Rooster Missed my shot! I can hit a gnat's eye at ninety yards! 
He reins his horse up, hastily tips the bottle to his mouth to make sure it is empty, and then hurls it high. 
He pulls out a navy six-gun and fires. 
The bottle reaches the height of its arc untouched, and drops. 
Rooster cocks his head at the landed bottle several paces distant. He shoots again and misses. He shoots a third time and the bottle shatters. 
Rooster The chinaman is running them cheap shells on me again. 
LeBoeuf I tdhought you were going to shay the shun was in your eyezh. That izh to shay, your eye. 
Rooster starts to dismount, finishing in a semi-controlled fall. He dusts one knee and reaches into his saddlebag. He pulls out a corn dodger and heaves it up. 
He fires. The corn dodger is obliterated. 
He reaches two corn dodgers from the saddlebag. 
Rooster Two at one time! 
He hurls them and quickly fires twice. Nothing happens; he quickly fires three times at the falling corn dodgers, missing. 
Scowling, he throws a single corn dodger and is just raising his gun when another gun goes off, making him jump. 
LeBoeuf has fired with a gun in his left hand, missing. 
Rooster I will chunk one high. Hold fire.

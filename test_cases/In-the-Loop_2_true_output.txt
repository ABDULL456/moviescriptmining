SIMON (approaching breaking point with Toby) Well I am tired but I'm also a career politician Toby, in the political powerhouse of the world for forty-eight hours. So I thought it might be nice to, you know, go out rather than sit in my room trying to spank one out watching a shark documentary, because I'm scared if I watch a porno it'll end up in the Register of Members Interests. So what have you got? 
TOBY Okay ... What have I got? 
SIMON Don't bullshit me Toby. 
TOBY Okay - so far, we have ... one flyer under the door for happy hour in the bar - which might be interesting? And I have the number of a guy I was with at Uni who I believe now works for CNN out here. 
SIMON No.

Karen on the phone. 
KAREN Liza, where are you? 
LIZA Waving at you. 
KAREN Make yourself more visible. 
LIZA I'm practically on top of you. They meet. 
KAREN You can stop talking on your phone now. Look, I have to leave. Phone Simon Foster's guy. Tell them to come to the war committee. I'll give them some face time around ten o'clock. It'll be coffee and Danish...tea..they're going to want tea. Tea and sympathy. Tea and a handjob, whatever. 
LIZA Ok.

Toby and Simon are lying on separate beds in their underpants watching a shark documentary. Toby is the on the phone. 
TV NARRATOR There is still a great deal that is unknown about great white shark mating behaviour... 
TOBY Well it is unbelievably hectic. Page 46

Toby's ending his call with Liza. 
TOBY Attending the war committee. That's big. I mean, I have been on a committee before. "Challenges for the cheese market" - that was a big one... but...yes, sure I'd love a drink. Forty minutes? Great. (he does that mobile thing where people sign off by repeatedly saying `bye' with increasing speed but diminishing volume) Bye bye bye-bye-bye-bye-bye bye. 
He hangs up. Very excited. Starts getting ready to see Liza. Checks his hair in the mirror. Not quite right. He opens a pot of hair gel, takes a scoop and rubs it in his hands, ready to put it in his hair. His phone goes again. 
Doesn't know what to do. Doesn't want to pick up the phone with gelly hands. No time to wash it off. Grabs a towel and picks up the phone holding the towel. He struggles to press the answer button. Puts the towel- covered phone to his ear. 
TOBY (CONT'D) Hello? Hi? Hello? 
He can't hear through the towel. Tries to adjust it. 
TOBY (CONT'D) Matty, hi, How's CNN? yes -- sorry? Do I sound muffled? 
Can't mate. Yeah, Liza Weld's's got us on to Linton's Future Planning Committee in the morning. The war committee, to you and me. So I'm prepping...what? Yes, Future Planning Committee is the war committee. You don't know that? I thought you worked for CNN? Or is that Cartoon Network News?

SIMON Come in....I just wasn't expecting you to be here. Physically here. Obviously, you're always in my heart. 
MALCOLM I'm here, I'm there, I'm fucking everywhere. I am the egg-man. 
SIMON Have you come to insult me in a different time zone?

Toby still on the phone. 
TOBY No, off out now for a drink with her...yeah, yeah, ha-di-ha, but nothing's going to happen there. Little Toby's staying in his hammock tonight. 
Toby checks himself in the mirror.

NECKBONE Shit. Ellis raises up behind him. He takes a deep breath, nods. 
NECKBONE (CONT'D) Your dad'd kill us he knew we went out there. 
ELLIS I'm not worried about my dad killin' us. THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER sprawls out in front of them. It's enormous. Their boat drifts at the mouth of the Arkansas, a small river by comparison. The Mississippi is a swirling mess of brown water and yellow foam six football fields wide. 
NECKBONE What if it sinks? 
ELLIS It ain't gonna sink. We gotta move if we're gonna make it back. Set your watch. We'll need a good fifteen minutes. Neckbone sets an alarm on his fat plastic wristwatch. They take their seats. Ellis cranks the motor. The small boat slowly chugs out onto the massive river. 
9 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - MORNING 9 
The boat lurches through the murky, rushing water. Neckbone has both hands firmly planted on the boat's edges. Ellis tries to handle the motor which has little impact against this current. The tail end of the boat swings to the right. Ellis flinches and grabs an edge to steady himself. The front of the boat bobs toward an ISLAND in the middle of the river. Neck turns to Ellis and points. 
NECKBONE 
THERE IT IS! 
10 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY 10 
The boys splash down in ankle deep water. They take hold of the front of the boat and drag it onto the muddy shore. Neckbone jogs to a tree line in the center of the island. Ellis snatches up his backpack and follows. 
11 EXT. ISLAND WOODS - CONTINUOUS 11 
The island, only 60 some yards in diameter, is separated by a clump of tall trees that form a wooded area in its center. The trees make it so you can't see from one side of the island to the other. 
NECKBONE Galen thinks it's been here awhile. Thinks the last flood did it. Ellis follows as Neckbone winds through the trees. They stop at a deep creek that cuts across the island. Neckbone looks to his right, then his left. Sees what he's looking for. 
NECKBONE (CONT'D) It's down there. A fallen tree trunk that straddles the creek. Ellis starts across. 
NECKBONE (CONT'D) Hold it. Neckbone picks a large stone up off the ground. 
NECKBONE (CONT'D) Look. Eight feet below the tree trunk, a nest of water moccasins curl around in the creek. Neckbone drops the stone on top of them. The snakes fan out. 
NECKBONE (CONT'D) Little shits. Their mud-caked high-tops stomp across the trunk. 
12 EXT. ISLAND WOODS - DAY 12 
The boys stop near the base of a large tree and stare up. Ellis cranes his neck back. Awestruck. 
NECKBONE So there it is. 
ELLIS Yeah, there it is. A 26 Foot Long BOAT sits nestled in the tree limbs above. 
13 EXT. BOAT IN TREE - MOMENTS LATER 13 
The boys scale up the tree from low lying branches. Ellis, hands on the edge of the boat, gets a leg over the side and pulls himself onto the deck. He reaches down and helps to drag Neckbone on board. They get to their feet, steadying themselves on the wooden deck. It's solid. They take in their new vantage point. 
ELLIS It came down from up there. Ellis points to higher limbs that have long been broken off. Neckbone walks to the back of the boat and hangs his head over. He finds a gaping hole of gutted wood. 
NECKBONE Motor broke off. Ellis isn't concerned with the motor. His eyes are locked on a covered cabin at the front of the boat. 
ELLIS Who else knows about this? 
NECKBONE Just me and Galen. 
ELLIS What's he think? 
NECKBONE He don't care about it. 
ELLIS Good. Ellis walks to the cabin. He pushes a vinyl door open. 
ELLIS (CONT'D) 'Cause this boat's ours. Ellis has to duck down to go inside. Neckbone follows. 
14 INT. BOAT CABIN - CONTINUOUS 14 
Ellis, stooping over, makes his way into the tiny cabin room. Yellow floral curtains, stained with age, cover a row of windows that wrap around the top of the cabin. These provide an odd glow in an otherwise dark, wood paneled space. There is a bench with rotted out cushions to the left. To the right, a mold-covered sink and mirror. Neckbone peers over Ellis' shoulder at the front of the cabin room. A small booth sits to the right across from a miniature toilet partially shielded by an open door. 
NECKBONE It's got its own shitbox Neckbone slides back a portion of floral curtain and light streams in. He starts opening small closets and drawers. Ellis plops down on the rotted bench cushions. 
ELLIS This is perfect. 
NECKBONE Ho-Lee-Shit. Neckbone stares in an open drawer. He removes a stack of Playboys from the 1980's. Ellis smiles at him. He leans back and props his foot against the sink cabinet across from him. This is home. Neckbone opens the first Playboy. It disintegrates.

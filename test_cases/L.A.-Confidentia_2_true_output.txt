Bloody, exhausted, Exley sits across from two INTERNAL AFFAIRS DETECTIVES. 
INTERNAL AFFAIRS #1 You have a lot of explaining to do, Lieutenant. 
EXLEY Yes.  I do. 
As Exley begins...

EXLEY That's it.  That's the whole story. 
As Exley looks to the gray-tinted wall mirror... 
OBSERVATION ROOM 
Loew leans over, whispers to the Chief. 
LOEW The press would have a field day with this.

CHIEF Captain Edmund Exley.  Chief of Detectives.  Los Angeles Police Department. 
Applause.  Flashbulbs.  Lynn watches from the back as Exley runs a handshake gauntlet.  Finally, he spots her. She's returned to her natural brunette.  Looks even better.  Exley steps over. 
EXLEY (ironic smile) I tried to throw it all away and they give it back in spades. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 
Exley walks Lynn out. 
EXLEY Where will you go? 
LYNN Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is. 
EXLEY When? 
LYNN Right now, before I back down. 
EXLEY Where is he? 
Lynn gestures ahead.  They walk to her car.  She opens the back door.  Bud's in the back.  Braces on his legs, head sutured.  Jaw wired shut and tubes running in and out.  But his hands still look strong.  Bud forces a smile through the wires, tries to say something, but can't. 
EXLEY Thanks for the push. 
Exley takes his hand.  Bud squeezes till both men wince. 
EXLEY You just did what you did.  No rank, no glory. 
Exley slips his Medal of Valor into Bud's hand. 
EXLEY From me to you.  It'll mean something if it's yours. 
Bud takes it, turns away so Exley won't see the tears. 
LYNN We should go now. 
As Exley steps back, Lynn closes the door.  PARTY noises drift from upstairs.  Exley looks to Lynn.

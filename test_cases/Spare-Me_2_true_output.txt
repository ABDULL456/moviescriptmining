SHEILA Did you - kill him? 
Theo paces up and down in front of the upright bridge. 
THEO How do you get this thing down? 
SHEILA Tell me what happened Theo. 
Theo backs Sheila towards the bridge control booth. 
THEO (glares at Sheila) You wanted me to kill him, didn't you? 
SHEILA (in shock) If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back. 
THEO He's dead Sheila. 
SHEILA I feel sick. 
THEO You should. 
SHEILA Are you sure he's dead? 
THEO I didn't stop to take his pulse. 
Theo boosts Sheila up the ladder to the control booth. The hydraulic machinery of the bridge heaves into motion and the bridge begins to lower. Theo walks over to his car. Sheila jumps down from the bridge control booth and follows him. 
SHEILA Where are you going? 
THEO I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car. 
SHEILA Can I come with you? 
THEO I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel. 
CUT TO: 
65     INT. THEO'S CAR - NIGHT				    65 
Theo grips the steering wheel with white knuckles. He nods off at the wheel, the roadway through his eyes wavering and distorting. He hits himself in the face in an effort to keep himself awake. 
66     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE - NIGHTMARE			  66 
The house is dark except for a light coming from the closed bathroom door. Theo cautiously makes his way to the door. 
THEO (whispers) Buzz? You alright? 
WATER is running inside. Theo twists the doorknob and opens the door with a jolt. Junior lunges out of the dark, mangled and bloody with bowling pins sticking out of his chest. 
JUNIOR Don't you KNOCK? 
Theo SLAMS the door shut. 
67     EXT. BUZZ'S HOUSE - DAWN				   67

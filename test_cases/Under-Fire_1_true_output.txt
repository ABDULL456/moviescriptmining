HUB KITTLE AND AN OFFICER BURST INTO THE ROOM interrupting the interview. Something has happened. Somoza initially lashes out at them -- the first time we've seen him lose his cool -- then recovers. 
SOMOZA (in Spanish) I am busy! Get out of here at once or I'll put my foot up your ass! 
The OFFICER seems familiar with these tirades and grabs Somoza by the arm, whispering into his ear. Somoza seems delighted with the news and turns to Hub for confirmation. Hub nods. 
SOMOZA (to Claire) I'm sorry to have to conclude this most pleasant encounter, but something has happened. 
As Somoza leaves the room with the Officer and Hub, Hub turns to Claire to squeeze in one final P.R. stroke. 
HUB Did he tell you about his parents in the graveyard, the flowers and all that? (she nods) Good, good... 
Claire is left alone momentarily in Somoza's room. A soldier enters and accompanies her outside to the luncheon. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE LUNCHEON - DAY 
As Claire comes outside, there is a flurry of activity at the head table. TWO OFFICERS hastily set up an easel with a large military-topographical map of Nicaragua. A SOLDIER takes the microphone from the Singers -- the music grinds to an inglorious halt -- and carries it to the head table. 
Price spots Claire and makes a "What's all this about?" motion. Claire holds out her palms and shrugs -- she doesn't know. All attention is quickly focused on the head table, as: 
PRESIDENT SOMOZA MAKES A GRAND ENTRANCE FLANKED by Hub Kittle and an Officer. He seems suddenly in unusually good spirits. Hub taps the mike -- it works -- he motions for Somoza to come forward. 
SOMOZA My friends... this gathering was not intended to be a press conference as much as a... "get-together"... but I have just been handed a piece of news. 
Somoza plays the moment with theatrical elan. 
SOMOZA Rafael is dead. (beat) He has been killed in an ambush in the Cordillera mountains of the Jinotega district. 
Somoza points to a spot on the map as do his Officer. 
THE PRESS TABLE IS SHAKEN FROM ITS NONCHALANCE and several journalists immediately leap to their feet to question him. 
JOURNALISTS Mr. President! Mr. President! 
SOMOZA Please my friends -- no questions. A press release is being prepared. 
Somoza hands the mike to an aide who returns it to the music stand. Almost immediately the music begins again. 
AT THE PRESS TABLE there is some confusion over the announcement. Some journalists hurry off to file the story, others just sit. Price seems alarmed by the announcement, confused. Slightly wired, he listens to Regis and OTHER JOURNALIST discuss it. 
OTHER JOURNALIST They got Rafael? You believe that? 
REGIS Every six months Tacho gives this speech -- maybe they finally lucked out. 
CLAIRE TRIES TO CORNER HUB KITTLE who is heading back inside. Hub disappears inside, Claire pressing after him. 
JAZY APPROACHES PRICE and leans in as if sharing a confidence. IN the b.g. the luncheon is breaking up. 
JAZY Russell, excuse me... but I've just been put in a rather embarrassing position. (hesitates) Mrs. Somoza would like her picture taken with Miss Panama. In color? 
Price throws his camera bag over his shoulder, pulls out a camera, and follows Jazy. They walk toward the head table. 
PRICE How the hell could Tacho find Rafael. 
JAZY Russell, please... I have my hands full... 
Mrs. Somoza and Miss Panama are waiting as Price and Jazy arrive. Price is automatically switching camera lenses, but he continues to grill Jazy. 
MRS. SOMOZA Tacho, Tacho... venga, por favor! 
Price and Jazy exchange glances as Somoza reluctantly joins the portrait. 
SOMOZA POSES WITH HIS WIFE AND HIS MISTRESS ON EACH ARM as Price flashes a light meter under their noses, then backs off to take the picture. 
PRICE Is Tacho lying again? They did kill him, didn't they? 
JAZY Everybody smile. 
Price takes a picture, Somoza wants to leave and Jazy would just as soon have this awkward moment over with, but: 
PRICE One more, please! Una mas, por favor? 
Reluctantly they pose again, and Price grills Jazy who is trapped. 
PRICE We help each other, right? Could you move your girlfriend into the sun... 
Jazy moves Miss Panama slightly, returning to Price. 
JAZY What do you need? 
PRICE Is Rafael alive or dead? 
JAZY I don't know. 
PRICE (to the posers) Just one more -- thank you. (to Jazy) I thought you knew everything? 
As Somoza holds an interminable pose, Jazy launches into a speech, keeping his voice low enough so Tacho cannot hear.

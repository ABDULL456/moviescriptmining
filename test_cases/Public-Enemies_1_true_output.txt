CONTINUED: ( 2) Hoover separates from Karpis. 
NEWSMEN Mr. Hoover! Director! 
HOOVER Karpis said he'd never be taken alive, but I took him without firing a shot. 
(BEAT) That marks him as a yellow rat. He was scared to death when I arrested him. 
(BEAT) That's all I got to say. Suydam and the special publicist, COURTNEY COOPER address the reporters. 
SUYDAM I'll answer any questions. 
REPORTER #1 Mr. Hoover captured Karpis? 
SUYDAM Mr. Hoover personally placed Alvin Karpis = eier arrest today. Karpis reached for a rzf le, but the Director was too fast. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CLYDE TOLSON'S OUTER OFFICE - MELVIN PURVIS - DAY 
waits. It looks like he's been waiting for awhile. People who pass act as if he is invisible. They look right through him. 
TOLSON The Director will see you now. 
INT. HOOVER'S OFFICE - HOOVER - DAY 
Purvis stands in front of the desk. On the right of the desk is a plaster death mask of John Dillinger. 
HOOVER (without looking up) Agent Purvis. 
PURVIS Yes sir. 
HOOVER (sees Purvis stare at death 
MASK)

(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HOOVER (CONT'D) A medical student in the morgue made that cast of Dillinger's face. It's a reminder of the war we continue to wage against the punks and hoodlums... Purvis looks at Hoover. This was the golden boy who Hoover came to despise. 
PURVIS One thing I learned was that John Dillinger was an outlaw and my Adversary. But he was no punk. And he was no hoodlum. 
(BEAT) Another is that I have no future in your Bureau. And I don't desire one. I quit. Purvis tosses his badge on Hoover's desk and walks out. Hoover couldn't care less. 
INT. MILAN WOMEN'S PRISON - GRANITE WALL - DAY

INT. INTERVIEW CELL - DOOR OPENS 
Billie enters. She's surprised to see Winstead. 
WINSTEAD How are you doing, Billie? 
BILLIE 
(SITS) If you come here to ask me more damned questions. "Where's this one or that one? Did I know Vern Miller? Who did what...?" Winstead shakes his head no. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WINSTEAD I didn't come here for you to tell me something. I came here to tell you something. 
CLOSER: BILLIE She sees in Winstead's face, the look of people she grew up with. Billie senses none of the cunning of the lawyer/special agents she's been dealing with. She leans forward, indicates a cigarette out of Winstead's pocket. He hands her one and lights it. 
BILLIE Okay, Mr. Winstead. What do you got to tell me? Winstead leans forward. 
BILLIE (CONT'D) 
(CONTINUOUS) They say you're the man who shot him? 
WINSTEAD 'M'at's right. One of them. 
BILLIE 6 why are you coming here to see me? To see the damage you done?

RUDY What about the vault? 
DOC Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business... 
RUDY Wire pull over? 
DOC One-inch stuff on a three-number combination. 
RUDY I'm good at that. 
DOC I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way... 
RUDY (smile) Whatever you need. 
To Rudy and Jackson, Doc points to the map and farmhouse picture: 
DOC Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
CAROL (holding two passports and four visas held together by a rubber band) If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso. 
She hands Doc the visas, as she puts the two passports in her bag. 
DOC I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to GollieÂ«s. Okay. Any questions? 
RUDY Aren't we going a little hard? 
DOC What do you have in mind? 
RUDY It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one. 
DOC (a long look at Rudy) Dillinger got killed. 
Jackson and Rudy begin to exit. The Accountant enters. 
DOC (CONT'D) (to Accountant) Tell Beynon I want no mistakes. 
I make four phone calls, his boys better pick up. 
ACCOUNTANT I understand. 
DOC Beynon has to be alone at the drop ... one car at the ranch and that's it. I won't have the money... she won't know where it is until I'm sure it's clear. 
ACCOUNTANT He understands. 
DOC Make sure everybody does. 
INT. BEACON HOTEL - NIGHT 
DOC AND CAROL ARE GETTING READY FOR BED. It is the night before the robbery. Carol stands looking in the mirror. 
CAROL You know how I feel? 
DOC My mind's not on guessing games. 
Carol turns away from the mirror. 
CAROL Promise you won't laugh. 
DOC (shakes his head; smiles) If it's funny I'm going to laugh. 
CAROL I feel like the night before the first day of school. 
DOC That bad? 
Carol laughs. 
DOC (CONT'D) You promised not to laugh. 
They both laugh. Long beat. Carol gets into bed. Doc is already in bed. 
CAROL It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more. 
DOC Waiting's hard. You never learn how. 
CAROL You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting. 
DOC At least you were outside. 
CAROL It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DOC Bullshit. 
CAROL I mean it. 
DOC I know you do. But it is different. (before she can interrupt suddenly up a notch) It's different. (quieting down) We'll be all right tomorrow.

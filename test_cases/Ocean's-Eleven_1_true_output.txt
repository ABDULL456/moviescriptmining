LIVINGSTON Thanks. 
And he's out. 
86   INT. BELLAGIO - LIVINGSTON'S SUITE - NIGHT                      86 
Danny and Rusty exhale. 
DANNY Well... 
RUSTY Yeah... 
DANNY Fourth task:    construction... 
87   INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY                                            87 
The gang hauls building materials -- lumber, tools, paint, etc. -- and Yen hauls three times his share, carrying objects on his head/shoulders/arms, a circus act in a hardware store. 
DANNY (V.O.) We need to build an exact, working replica of the Bellagio vault. 
RUSTY (V.O.) For practice. 
DANNY (V.O.) Something like that. 
As Linus hauls in materials, Danny takes him aside. 
DANNY Fifth task: intelligence. We need those codes, Linus. From the only man who has all three. 
LINUS Benedict. 
DANNY Learn to love his shadow. (back to the team) Sixth task: transport...

LINUS (young and eager) Wait, wait, wait. All I get to do is watch him? 
DANNY For now. You gotta walk before you crawl. 
RUSTY (to Linus, correcting Danny) Reverse that. 
DANNY (toward the Malloys) Sixth task: transport... 
88   EXT. BILLY TIM'S VAN AND TRUCK DEALERSHIP - OFFICE - DAY         88 
Outside a window: Turk and Virgil jump up and down on opposite bumpers of a van, testing its durability. 
Inside, Frank negotiates with BILLY TIM, a Cal- Worthingtonesque redneck car dealer, who half-pays attention to him, half-frets over the Malloys outside. 
BILLY TIM I'm sorry: eighteen-five each is the best offer I can make you. 
FRANK (playing a bit of a dandy) Oh, I understand perfectly. They are beautiful vans. Well, I thank you for your time, Mister...? 
BILLY TIM Denham.   Billy Tim Denham. 
FRANK Yes, Denham, like a jean. (they shake) You know: you have lovely hands -- do you moisturize? 
BILLY TIM I'm sorry?

Frank's not letting go of the man's hand, the object now is to force Billy Tim into lowering his price just to get Frank out of his office. 
FRANK I swear by it. I try all sorts of lotions. I went through a fragrance-free period last year, but now I'm liking this new brand fortified with rose hip. My sister, you know, she uses the aloe vera with the sun screen built in... 
BILLY TIM (just can't get his hand back) Uh-huh. You said you'd be willing to pay in cash? 
FRANK I did. You know: they say cinnamon is wonderful for your pores. Read that on the internet. And that ideally you should be wearing gloves to bed, but I find that would interfere with my social agenda. Problem is: I get a reaction to camphor so I can't use traditional remedies... 
BILLY TIM If you could pay cash, I could probably drop the price a little. To, say, seventeen... (as Frank squeezes a little) ... sixteen each. 
FRANK (big smile) That would be lovely. 
89   INT. WAREHOUSE - BACK TO DANNY - DAY                           89 
overseeing the construction, reviewing his list of tasks on his fingers, suspecting he's missed one. 
DANNY ... Power, surveillance, transport... 
(CONTINUED)

TISHKOFF Anything I can do? 
Danny's eyes flash from Tishkoff to Saul, behind him, dressed in his usual frumpy attire: that's what he missed. 
DANNY Get your wallet. 
90   INT. HABERDASHERY                                              90 
A tailor fits Saul for the finest suits Tishkoff's money can buy. As Saul smoothes out a coat sleeve... 
SAUL This is nice material. 
DANNY It's Armani, Saul. 
SAUL It's very nice. 
Saul's not fooling anyone: he's scared, right down to his Florsheims. Danny nods to the tailor: "Give us a moment." 
DANNY Saul, you sure you're ready to do this? 
Saul turns away, and when he faces Danny again, his entire aspect has changed: His features stone, his eyes icicles. 
SAUL If you ever question me again, Daniel, you won't wake up the following morning. 
They exchange a long, fierce glance; Saul's eyes never waver. 
DANNY You're ready. 
Danny signals Tishkoff: let's pay, and Saul immediately slumps into his old self. To a mirror, he practices... 
SAUL Hello.  My name is Lyman Zerga... (this time a little deeper) My name is Lyman Zerga... 
91   INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY                                         91 
Saul's dressed completely (and immaculately) now in Armani, with his hair slicked back, a brief moustache on his lip, and impenetrably dark glasses riding the bridge of his nose. He continues to practice, his accent even deeper now and specifying no geographic origin -- could be Scottish, could be Israeli...

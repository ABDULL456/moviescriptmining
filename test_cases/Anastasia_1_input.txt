Meetoo spots TWO UGLY PUG DOGS and a distinguished ELDERLY DOWAGER. He runs happily to play with them. She pulls her DOGS away from Meetoo. 
ELDERLY DOWAGER No, no, boys! You don't know where he's been! 
They give him a disgusted look and walk away. Meetoo looks a little hurt. 
INT. HALLWAY OF THE SHIP - NIGHT 
Dmitri and Vladimir are standing by a closed door. Anya is on the other side. 
ANYA (0. C.) No! I look ridiculous! 
VLADIMIR Come out! I can do alterations. 
ANYA (O.C.) You'll laugh. 
VLADIMIR I shant! 
ANYA (O.C.) Not you. Him. 
DMITRI I won't laugh - I swear... 
The door opens and Anya comes out in the blue dress Dmitri stole which at least ten sizes too big for her. She is still wearing her hair up and despite the size which actually gives her a "Kate Moss" waifish look with her men's boots and baggy dress - the blue brings out her eyes. Dmitri sees her and BUSTS OUT LAUGHING. 
ANYA You said you wouldn't laugh! 
DMITRI It's not you - it's the dress! 
Anya storms back into the cabin and slam the door behind her. 
INT.	CABIN - SIMULTANEOUS ACTION 
When Anya storms into the cabin, she catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror. 
ANYA (to herself) I'm never going to be.. 
Just then, the slamming door catches the back of her dress, pulling more than half of it into the door frame. She sees in the mirror that the now fitted dress shows a lovely woman's figure. Pleased, she looks at herself. 
ANYA (CONT.) Well! Maybe I am... 
EXT.	CABIN DOOR - NIGHT 
Vladimir and Dmitri wait outside the door. The door opens and Anya appears, having tied the veil around the waist of the dress, making it look fitted and beautiful. Dmitri and Vladimir are surprised as Anya walks past them with confidence and throws them a look over her shoulder. 
"REPRISE OF VLADIMIR'S SONG (OVER MONTAGE) 
The tone of the song would now change - - the older, wiser person watching as two younger people are unwittingly falling in love. The tone can still be light, as are the visuals here, but there would be an undercurrent of irony and romance. The song would end as Anya and Dmitri have their first, momentary embrace. 
MONTAGE: (MOS) 
ON DECK: Anya, still in her boots, walks gracefully down the deck in spite of the ship's rocking motion. Dmitri and Vlad can't even stand due to the motion. Anya looks back and flashes them a smile.

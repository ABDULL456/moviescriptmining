VOICE 
TUA Part two. Mating rumpled bed, The sunset is replaced by a shot of Julie on a working on legal briefs, a camera-faced shadow crossing the image. 
VOICE Certain objects develop a special, shared meaning to lovers. Here are some objects significant to our test subjects. Shot of coffee-rings on a table. 
VOICE The coffee rings Peyton tends to leave. They irritate Julie, and he leaves them everywhere! Quick shots. Coffee rings on a lab report. Coffee rings on a book-shelf. Coffee rings on a wall and ceiling. Julie laughs.

VOICE Yet such minor irritations can strangely become endearing to the other mate. 
JULIE Not just yet they haven't. The slide changes to a shot of a bottle covered in wax. 
VOICE The bottle of Dom Perignon Champagne Julie gave Peyton for his twenty-first birthday. Now it serves as a candle holder. 
QUIETLY; 
JULIE I never gave you that. The champagne bottle is replaced by a shot of a record album turning on a player. The music plays over the image. Haunting. Romantic. 
VOICE Finally, the single Love in the ark The song continues. Julie smiles, swept away by it. 
VOICE This song was playing when the two first kissed. A high school prom picture comes up on the screen. Peyton in an awkwardly fitting tux and Julie, a blossoming beauty. In the slide, they have been caught kissing. 
VOICE Now let us leave our test-subjects. The sunset again. ov in the Dark theme plays over it,. and eventually fades away.

CUT TO: 
55 INT WESTLAKE LAB - MORNING 55 Sunshine streams through the sheers of the window onto Julie's shoulder. She sits on the bed going over some papers, her expression increasingly disturbed. Julie punches a number into the phone. 
JULIE .Dale Gorson, please... Peyton's hand enters with a mug of coffee, which he sets on the papers in front of her. 
JULIE Peyton! Julie takes the mug away; it has indeed left a brown circle on the topmost memo. Julie smiles at him. Then: 
JULIE Dale? Yes, Julie Hastings... yes, I found some memos researching the Von Hoffenstein deal that I don't think I was supposed to find... From the late Mr. Strack to a guy named Claude Bellasarious. They're records of payments to various people on the zoning commission... Peyton, behind her, massages her back. 
JULIE .They look like payoffs. Suspicious, at the very least... Well, the way I'd like to proceed is to talk to Strack's son first... Give him the benefit of the doubt. Under the circumstances, it's the least I can do. She hangs up. Peyton kisses her. She leans back into his arms and closes her eyes blissfully. Reluctantly, she rises and slips on her shoes. Peyton watches her admiring everything about her. She gracefully lays her legal papers in her briefcase and heads for the door. Half way out the door she turns to Peyton.

57 PEYTON 57 Dressed in jeans and sweatshirt, hurries to catch up to her. 
PEYTON Julie, wait! She is opening the cab door when she turns to him. 
JULIE What's the matter? 
PEYTON I've been thinking. Maybe we should get married. 
58 JULIE 58 Freezes half in and half out of the cab door. Panicked. 
58 CONTINUED 
JULIE Marriage--well, we could do that--of course, there's our careers--I men, I'm just starting to get things going at the firm. And, you know, I kind of like having my own 
PLACE -- 
PEYTON 'We're practically living together now. All marriage means is you answer the phone in the and if you to pretend grandmother, it's a wrong number. The poor woman's beginning to think she has alzheimer's.

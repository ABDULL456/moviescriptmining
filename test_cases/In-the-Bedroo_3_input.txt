WAITRESS No, thanks. Maybe some other night. He stands in front of his Brown Suburban, watching as the Waitress gets in her car, pulls away and leaves. 
RICHARD Fuckin' bitch. He turns and freezes. Matt Fowler stands a few feet away, an Ortaies calibre 7.65 automatic directly at Richard's face. His gloved hand poin grips the gun tightly. 
RICHARD Dr. Fowler? 
MATT Don't talk. Unlock it and get in. 
RIC He . wait a minute. Let's, let's just calm down... Matt COCKS the gun. 
RIC Alright! Shit. Richard obeys. He unlocks both doors. Matt opens the back door, but stays planted, the gun trained on Richard. Richard gets in the driver's seat. Matt climbs in the back. He presses the gun's muzzle against the back of Richard's head. 
V 0-, 
MATT Is there any one at your place? 
RIC 
(IRONICALLY) 
NOT TONIGHT 
MATT Good. Drive there. Richard looks over his shoulder to back the car up. Matt aims at his temple, but does not look at his eyes. Richard finishes backing up and puts it into drive. 
MATT Drive slowly - don't try to get stopped. 
EXT. PETER'S PARKING LOT ALLEY 
Matt can see the ocean. He uncocks the revolver. Matt cracks the window. Matt leans down in his seat. He transfers the gun into his left hand, removes the glove from his right, and wipes the sweat from his bare palm onto his pantleg. He puts the glove back on, gripping the gun. Richard's Brown Suburban drives down an alley adjacent to Fun Park and turns onto a deserted Main Street. 
INT/EXT. BROWN SUBURBAN - NIGHT 
They drive back through town, the sea wall on their left hiding the beach. on the right are the places, most with their neon signs off, that do so much business in s er: the lounges and cafes and pizza houses. The street itself empty of traffic. 
RICHARD He was making it with my wife. His voice is careful, not pleading. Matt presses hard with the muzzle against Richard's head. Richard flinches and moves his head forward. Matt lowers the gun to his lap. 
MATT Don-t talk. 
/EXT. BROWN SUBURBAN RICHARD S TROUT'S DUPLEX - NIGHT 
The Brown Suburban slowly pulls up to the front. Matt leans forward. Th. muzzle grazing Richard's head. Drive it to the back. 
RIC You wouldn't have it cocked, would you? For when I put on the brakes. Matt COCKS it. It is now. Richard tenses. He drives around the side of the building. 
EXT. RICHARD STROUT'S DUPLEX BACK YARD - NIGHT 
The Brown Suburban inches forward toward the garage and brakes. The engine shuts off. Matt keeps the cocked gun firmly trained on Richard. He gets out and shuts the door with his hip. 
MATT All right. Richard looks at the gun, then gets out. He moves across the grass. Matt closely behind, looking at the row of small backyards on either side of them and scattered tall trees. He glances from house to house. Looking for signs of one insomniac neighbor, some man or woman sitting alone watching the all-night channel from Boston. All is quiet. They move up the back walk and to the side kitchen door. Matt stands directly behind Richard as he opens the door. It-s pitch black inside the duplex. 
MATT Turn on the light. Richard flips the wall switch. in the light. Matt stares at his wide back, and long reach. 
I NT. RICHARD S TROUT'S DUPLEX - KITCHEN NIGHT Richard stops just inside the kitchen. Matt closes the door softly behind gim. 
MATT Where-s you r suitcase? Richard almost turns around. 
RIC My suitcase? 
Matt grips the gun tighter, straining to keep it from ling. 
MATT Where is it? 
RIC in the bedroom closet. 
MATT That's where were going then. When we get to a door you stop and turn on the light. They cross the kitchen. Matt can't help but glance at the sink and stove and refrigerator: no dishes in the sink or even the dish rack beside it, no grease splashings on the stove, the refrigerator clean and white. Matt becomes momentarily 2reoccupied with one of Duncan's drawings taped to its door.

EXT.  LEVEL TEN, TECHNO-SKYSCRAPER -- NIGHT 
ON ALEX AND THE BOY 
as they blink into existence on this level.  Alex rises, shaking badly. Her armor is battered, burnt, covered with grim and blood...it's impossible to tell who's blood, though.  She looks like she's just walked out of a slaughter-house. 
A bone-jarring HUMMING is heard.  Alex turns... 
ARCADE'S BRAIN 
looms over her, all glass and black steel.  It reaches into the sky and keeps on going.  Massive.  Tendrils of crackling ENERGY race up and down it, BUZZING.  And as impossible as it may seem, this thing definitely appears to be alive. 
TWO GLASS DOORS 
swing open in invitation.  A red carpet rolls out from within the building, rolling by itself.  Emerald City time. The carpet unfurls completely, ending just at Alex's feet. 
Above the doors, a neon sign blinks on, one word at a time, "THIS...IS...THE...PLACE".  Fucking-A. 
Alex offers a tired, near-maddened laugh.  It's all she can do anymore. 
THE BOY 
looks up at Alex, frightened. 
BOY We have to go in there, don't we? 
Alex nods.  She takes his hand and together, they walk down the red carpet towards the entrance of ARCADE'S brain. 
INT.  LEVEL TEN, ARCADE'S BRAIN -- NIGHT 
Inside, the lobby is a cacophony of LIGHT and SOUND.  We hear HUNDREDS OF VOICES at once...whispering...fading in and out...  It's like channels being changed.  A snippet of an opera here, maybe Bugs Bunny's voice there...RAP MUSIC, COUNTRY MUSIC, a woman in the throes of orgasm, Nazis screaming "HEIL HITLER!", anything and everything. 
SIGNS BLINK ON AND OFF... 
Catchy phrases like, "THIS IS MY BRAIN AND WELCOME TO IT", and "I THINK, THEREFORE, I'M FUCKED" flash before us. 
T.V. MONITORS 
are everywhere, displaying an endless array of STATIC.  And now the monitors are displaying FRACTALS.  Every single one of them.  We hear the CELLOS, like an orchestra tuning up. 
ALEX 
throws her hands over her ears as the SOUNDS become unbearable. 
ALEX (top of her lungs) SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
She pulls out her gun at FIRES into the SOUNDS and IMAGES. Shooting the fuck out of everything.  Monitor screens shatter, glass flies and... 
...just like that, total silence descends.  One by one, the lights blink off, and it's dark once again. 
INT. LEVEL TEN, THE NIGHT ROOM -- 
A SPOTLIGHT 
comes on, isolating Alex.  The boy stands behind her, and everything else is dark.  It's impossible to tell how large the room is.  It might go on forever. 
MORE LIGHTS 
come on now, pin-point spots illuminating the faces of her friends. They're all there...Stilts, Laurie, the others. Even Nick.  They sit in rows, motionless...a peanut gallery.  It's eerie as hell. 
And now, Alex sees something else, Greg.  He's encased in a block of ice. A frozen prince.  And in his hands he holds a sword.  The sword is very unusual.  The hilt is shaped like a heart and it glows RED as if it had just pulled from a furnace.  Alex realizes that the sword is ARCADE'S heart. 
Alex moves towards Greg.  As she gets closer, she sees a keyhole carved into the ice. 
Alex knows what to do.  She withdraws her belt on which the nine golden keys are attached.  Removing the keys, Alex begins to fit them together...one, two, three...until they combine to form the shape of a single, greater key. 
THE KEY 
Alex fits it into the keyhole and turns it. 
THE CASE OF ICE 
splits in half, opening up with a cloud of frosty air. Inside, Greg is frozen still, clutching the sword.  Alex pulls the sword out of his stiff grip, lifting it up. 
ALEX (looking around) Okay.  I'm here, ARCADE. Where are you? 
No answer.  Alex turns, eyes searching through the darkness. 
ALEX (shouting) Where are you, damnit?! 
Her voice echoes in the cavernous room. 
ARCADE (O.S.) RIGHT HERE, BITCH. 
Alex spins around and...

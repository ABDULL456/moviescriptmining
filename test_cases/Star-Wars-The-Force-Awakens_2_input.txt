BEHIND THE FALCON as it DROPS OUT OF LIGHTSPEED, revealing a BEAUTIFUL GREEN PLANET ahead, TAKODANA. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY 
Han pilots. Finn and BB-8 beside him, Rey as co-pilot. Han notices Rey looking out the windshield, almost in tears. 
REY 
(QUIETLY) ... I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy... Han watches her -- sees a vulnerability that touches him. 
EXT. TAKODANA PLANET - DAY 
The Falcon CRESTS OVER an ENDLESS GREEN FOREST TO REVEAL a CASTLE on a picturesque LAKE. The Falcon lands near the castle, among dozens of WORN, smallish freighters. 
EXT. LANDING PAD - NEAR MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY 
Rey steps off the Falcon, UP TO CAMERA, BB-8 at her side. She takes in the towering stone CASTLE, FOREST to one side, LAKE to the other. Serene, beautiful, all new to her. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY 
From BLACKNESS: a storage unit opens. Han rummages, retrieving old BLASTERS. Finn arrives behind him, concerned. 
FINN Hey, Solo -- I'm not sure what we're walking into here -- 
HAN D'you just call me "Solo"? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
FINN Sorry. Han-- Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? First Order sympathizers? 
HAN Listen big deal, you've got another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Hands him a BLASTER. 
HAN (CONT'D) Always. Han walks off. Finn watches him go, wracked with guilt. 
EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY 
Han hands Rey a blaster pistol as she stands at looks at the castle. 
HAN You might need this. 
REY I think I can handle myself. 
HAN I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it. Rey picks it up. Grips it. 
HAN (CONT'D) You know how to use one of these? 
REY Yeah, you pull the trigger. 
HAN There's a little bit more to it than that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name? 
REY Rey. 
HAN Rey. I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew, Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out. Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, appreciates the Falcon. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
REY Are you offering me a job? 
HAN I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't pay much. 
REY You're offering me a job. 
HAN I'm thinking about it. Rey wants to say yes. But something stops her. A line she can't cross. 
HAN (CONT'D) Well? 
REY If you were, I'd be flattered. But I have to get home. Han looks at her, questioningly. 
HAN Jakku? Rey looks off, in thought. Yeah, Jakku. 
REY 
(BEAT) I've already been away too long. 
HAN 
(TO CHEWIE) Chewie, check out the ship as best you can. 
HAN (CONT'D) It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you. Han heads off. HOLD on Rey.

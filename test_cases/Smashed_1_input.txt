The group CHUCKLES. 
JENNY (CONT'D)                           * And I found a love in cooking. I've                * got my own catering business now.                  * And...maybe I just replaced alcohol with chocolate chips and cigarettes, but still...it's been years since I woke up in a park -- in a different state. 
LAUGHTER. 
Kate leans in towards Mr. Davies and whispers -- 
KATE I kinda like her. 
MR. DAVIES Sponsor potential? 
Kate nods. 
MR. DAVIES (CONT'D) Get her number at break. 
KATE I feel like you're my wingman. 
Kate grins at Mr. Davies, who smiles shyly and glances away. 
LATER 
An older man -- ARLO -- stands and announces. 
ARLO                                    * Arlo, Alcoholic. There'll now be a ten minute break. Smoke em' if you got em. 
As some of the PEOPLE go outside -- 
-- Kate walks over to Jenny, who's getting a cup of coffee.    * 
KATE Hey, I liked your speech. 
JENNY                                  * Thanks. All that dumb shit happened so I'm glad that now it's at least entertaining. (beat) What's your name? 
KATE Kate. This is my first meeting. Or... first meeting where I'm not wasted. 
Jenny LAUGHS.                                                  * 
JENNY                                   * Oh, yeah -- I remember doing some of that. 
KATE I don't really know how this stuff works. (MORE) 
KATE (CONT'D) But...could I get your number? I mean, I may not need it, but... 
JENNY                                     * Yeah, of course. I can help explain it to you -- and also, we can just talk. 
KATE Okay. Yeah. (beat) You've been sober since you were 
Jenny nods.                                                   * 
KATE (CONT'D) That seems really young. 
JENNY                                    * I didn't have much of a choice -- I crashed my car into a nursing home. (beat) I think the break is just about over. This meeting is the kind where everyone can share. Sharing always helps me, so...if it's not too weird -- try introducing yourself and telling the group what's going on. 
LATER 
Everyone is sitting down and sharing. The woman (TINA) next   * to Kate is finishing up. 
TINA                                      * ...anyway, that's where I'm at today. Thanks for listening. 
Everyone looks at Kate. 
KATE Okay, um...hello. I'm Kate and... (long beat) ...I'm an alcoholic? 
Kate nervously LAUGHS. 
GROUP Hi, Kate. 
KATE Sorry. I don't mean to laugh -- it's just saying those words... (beat) ...I think I'm an alcoholic, but I don't really know. I drink -- a lot. I've always drank. Everyone I know drinks a lot. I never really thought I had a problem -- lately though it seems like maybe I do. I just want to be able to drink a beer without it turning into twenty -- or wetting my bed. (beat) It seems like every time I drink something awful happens. All the shit that I used to laugh off isn't really funny anymore. The dumb drunk stuff has gone from embarrassing to scary. (beat) I'm kinda...scared. 
Kate stops. Looks around self-consciously. 
CUT TO BLACK.

Even if Sigi is no longer the weakling he used to be before his stay in Italy, Georg, who is three years older than him, is much stronger: with the weight of his whole body he charges at Sigi, making him fall backward into the shallow water of the brook, and takes his whistle away. The shock almost knocks out Sigi, and though the stream isn't deep, half of his head lies under the flowing water. Georg sees the danger, but his pride prevents him from helping him, as it means admitting his own unjust behavior. For a moment he hesitates, a helpless and defiant grin on his face. But Ferdinand has already jumped into the water and pulls out Sigi, who shakes his head to fully come to his senses. Ferdinand looks up at Georg, who is standing on the bank, still holding the whistle in his hand. Then Georg points his finger at him, and says furiously and guiltily. GEORG (threatening): If you rat on me, you'll be sorry! 
67. RECTORY. STUDY. INT/DAY The pastor sits at his desk, working. A KNOCK is heard. PASTOR: Come in! Florian comes in, hesitantly. In his hand, he carries a birdcage (we've already seen it in Scene 49 in the boy's bedroom at night). In the cage is the bird that Florian had found on Thanksgiving day, and who has recovered in the meantime. PASTOR: Yes? The boy looks embarrassed. He glances at his father, then comes over with the cage and puts it carefully on his father's desk. As Florian approaches, the pastor looked on, amazed. After putting down the cage, Florian steps back a little, then stops, his head slightly bowed. PASTOR (not really understanding): What is it? What do you want? FLORIAN (softly): For Pipsi. (PAUSE. Then even more softly): Because Father is sad. The pastor looks at him, doesn't know how to react. Then,   with  a   hoarse   voice  and  trying to  look indifferent, he says: PASTOR: Thank you. 
FLORIAN (as apprehensive in front of his father's perceptible emotion): You're welcome, Father. For a moment, neither of them knows what to do. Then the boy leaves the room. The pastor follows him with his eyes. Then, he sits down. He tries to keep his composure, but in the end he bursts into tears. He sobs haltingly, trying hard not let it be heard. 
68.THE STEWARD'S HOUSE INT/EXT/DAY 
THE CHILDREN'S ROOM. Georg stands at the window and looks down at the 
COURTYARD 
Coming from   the   manor,   the   steward   is   walking   over briskly. 
THE CHILDREN'S ROOM. Georg leaves the window and sits down at his table, doing his homework. We hear the FRONT DOOR opening downstairs, then the father's hasty STEPS on the stairs. Finally, the father appears in the door. He's out of breath, furious, and tries to speak quietly STEWARD: Give me that whistle! Georg looks at his father, "not understanding". GEORG: I beg your pardon? STEWARD (forcedly, with threatening calm): Give me that whistle! GEORG: What whistle? At this, the steward pounces on the boy and smacks him so hard that he falls out of his chair. Give it to me! GEORG (on the ground): What whistle? The steward yanks him up and shoves him against the wall. Georg stumbles over the table which is standing in the way, and lies back on the table top, trying to protect his face with his hands. STEWARD: Give away it to me, or I'll kill you. GEORG (half moaning): I have no whistle. The steward lets go of him and starts to beat                him furiously. 
GEORG (screaming): Ouch! ...Ouch!! STEWARD (beat): You bastard, you wretch! GEORG (scream): Ouch! Ouch! !! Please don't At that moment, attracted by the noise, Emma, the mother, appears: EMMA: For God's sake, Georg, what are you doing? What has the boy done? The mother's arrival has snapped the father out of his blind rage. He glances at her, then turns to the boy again, breathless with excitement, but forcing himself to be calm: STEWARD: For the last time: give it to me! GEORG (almost crying with pain): But I don't know what you mean, Father. The mother looks uncomprehendingly from one to the other, then turns pleadingly to her husband: EMMA: What's going on? What are you talking about? STEWARD (to Georg): You know exactly what I mean. Again the mother looks from one to the other, trying to save the situation: EMMA: But if he says so! Georg! What's going on? The steward turns to her, annoyed by her insistence, looks at her for a long moment, then at Georg again and turns on his heels and leaves the room.

HECTOR Let's go. 
155   INT./EXT. CAR - DUSK                                         155 They are driving on the freeway. It is dusk. Hector is on the telephone again. He can't let go of business. HECTOR Excuse me, kids... I have to consult the oracle... 
He gets connected. HECTOR Hello... God? No, Leonard, it's Hector... just a joke... sorry to phone you at home, did Boris call you? The insurance is fine? Good ... but she could claim negligence ... oh, she's got a lawyer already? That's a bad omen... Betsy and Tom are listening in the back seat, eager for clues about this virtual stranger in front of them. HECTOR Is there anything we can do right now... make her an offer... Sure, with the insurance company... sure... you're right... me, too... I have the kids in the car with me right now... sorry to bother you... 'bye...

155   CONTINUED:                                                       155 Hector throws the phone onto the passenger seat, lets out a sigh, and catches sight of the kids in the mirror. Their perplexed expressions make them look younger than they are, and vulnerable. Hector's heart aches for them. He smiles and puts on an act of brightness. 
HECTOR That's it! The last call... the weekend starts right now... we have things to do... look out for a Safeway... we need some supplies... and gas... oh my God, gas... soon... They return his look with blank expressions.        He picks up the phone and offers it to them. 
HECTOR Want to make any calls?    Betsy? She shakes her head. HECTOR Tom? TOM No... and it's Thomas... HECTOR But we called you Tom... that's what it says on your birth certificate... THOMAS (TOM) I changed it. Hector wisely lets it go. 
HECTOR Right... it's your name... you                            * can do that... Safeway... keep your                       * eyes skinned... and I could murder                        * a Chicken McNugget.                                       * 
156   INT. SAFEWAY - NIGHT                                           156 
Hector is pushing a cart around a large Safeway. The place is almost deserted. Betsy and Thomas are tagging along. 
(CONTINUED) 
156   CONTINUED:                                                      156 For every four items Hector puts in his cart Betsy removes three and returns them to the shelf. Hector notices and puts up with it for a while. But when Betsy returns the rolls of kitchen towel he has selected he makes a stand. He turns to face her. 
HECTOR What's wrong with that? It's a kitchen roll... why can't I pick a kitchen roll? 
Betsy is defiant. BETSY It's bleached... and it isn't recycled... you don't care... you just buy junk... She picks up a more friendly brand of kitchen towel from the shelf and throws it into the cart. Hector has the sense to back down. HECTOR Good point, Betsy... Betsy keeps on the attack. BETSY Everything you buy is junk... I don't eat steak... and what's this... She prods a packet of frozen hamburgers. 
BETSY Ugh! Why don't you ask us what we like... it'll save you money... you buy junk, we won't eat it... A trace of girlish common sense has crept into her voice. Hector warms to her. 
HECTOR You're right. 
Hector pushes the cart to her. 
HECTOR Well, get to it... I'll just tag along... 
Betsy moves off with the cart. BETSY I do it every week anyway. (CONTINUED) 
156   CONTINUED:    (2)                                          156 Thomas backs her up. 
THOMAS She does. She tells us what to eat. We let her. 
Hector follows them up the aisle. 
HECTOR Can I just keep a couple of those steaks? We can't live on chicken.                   * 
157   EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT                                   157 
Hector is filling up the car in a gas station close to the Safeway. An attractive woman is filling her car in the next line. Her eyes and Hector's meet. For some reason they exchange the smallest smile. For a few brief moments they are talking without words as their tanks fill. The ten billionth romance in the history of the planet sparks into life and fizzles out again in the twinkling of an eye. By the time their credit cards are back in their pockets their love is a memory. From the back of the car the kids have watched it all. Betsy gives Hector a withering look of disapproval as he climbs back into the car. 
158   INT./EXT. CAR - NIGHT                                      158 Back on the road, it is later. The kids have fallen asleep. Hector relaxes. He watches them in their sleep, searching for some traces of the little children that have haunted his thoughts for so many years, the tots he abandoned. 
159   EXT. HOLIDAY HOUSE - NIGHT                                 159

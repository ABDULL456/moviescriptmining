AMY I've got leads. I'll know in the end. 
CHARLES You know, Amy dearest, for the average person, hunger for knowledge is like hunger... for food. We want to know just enough to take the edge off our appetite. Then we're satisfied, and we stop. But you... you're like a glutton. You can't help over-eating. 
AMY I don't see you complaining. 
CHARLES But you see, that's the point. That's why I need you. Because all that stuff I don't eat... I still want. So I send you in to do the eating for me, and so I get to experience it, without actually suffering any mental indigestion. 
AMY That's for me... 
CHARLES Nobody's forcing anything down your throat. Correct? 
AMY No. 
CHARLES You see, Amy, you never grew up with all this Catholic god and guilt stuff. It doesn't mean anything to you. I worry about god and heaven and hell. Not during the day, you understand, but around three in the morning, it keeps me up. I want to know what's coming. What's up in heaven and down in hell, or even if there's nothing. It's useful, when you're making plans. So go find out and we'll tell the world. 
AMY You know, Charles, there's something vaguely demonic about you. 
CHARLES Did you know, the word "demon" comes from the Greek word for "knowledge." As in "demonstrate." 
AMY No, I didn't know that. 
Charles shakes his head, disgusted. 
CHARLES American education. 
They're in front of Amy's Hotel now. Charles flags down a CAB. 
CHARLES Then back to your room, lie down in your coffin until the hours of daylight have passed, as is your wont -- then go get me my story. A 
MY You don't have to worry. 
CHARLES I never do. I'm not here to save people and I'm not here to judge them. I just take `em as they come. And use them as they pass by. I'll be at the Soffitel. 
Charles hops in the cab and drives off as Amy walks up the steps to the Hotel lobby. Amy watches him go, waves, then spins back towards the curb. She flags down a cab and hops in. 
EXT. POTEILARI AND MINVARA - DAY 
A ragged, run-down place, looking bleak and ugly in the bright light of day. We see the street sign, identifying the place -- Poteilari and Minvara. A cab pulls up and Amy gets out. 
She crosses the street, passes one side door -- and then comes to a building that's been sealed up -- doors and windows cemented shut with cinder-blocks. 
Beyond a narrow railing is a stairway, pressed up sideways against the building, running down to a basement entrance. Amy looks down the stairway to it's narrow bottom. The stairs and the bottom are littered with trash. A filthy mattress lies at the very bottom. Amy heads down. 
EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS - DAY 
At the bottom of the stairs, there's a wooden door. A hole has been punched through it and a heavy padlocked chain has been threaded through it and through a heavy hasp that's been bolted to the door frame. Some official government notice of some kind has been tacked to the door -- long rendered unreadable by the effects of time. 
Amy inspects the padlock. It's heavy and uncompromising. She tugs on the door and it opens to the limits of the chain -- but that's only a few inches. Amy peers into the darkness beyond, but can't see a thing. 
She looks down at the mattress that she's standing on, steps to the side and shoves it up. 
Then, as if the light breaks, she reaches out, grabs the hasp and pulls. The bolts holding the hasp to the wall are loose. They slide out with it. She tugs the whole thing free and pulls the door open. 
There is a narrow corridor beyond, all in gloom. Amy enters. 
INT.   THE CORRIDOR - DAY

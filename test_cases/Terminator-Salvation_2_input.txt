MARCUS (nods, touched) Guess people had it pretty good. (FLIPS) What else we got... movers, mufflers, music-- 
STAR Music? 
MARCUS You know, pianos, guitars... 
STAR I don't remember music. 
MARCUS Come on. You must... (approximating the tune) "I can't get no... satisfaction..." (off her blank look) "We are family... I got all my sisters with me..." No, huh. How about... "Twinkle twinkle little star..." 
Star's face lights up, she nods eagerly, sings along: 
MARCUS & STAR "How I wonder what you are... up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky..." 
STAR is dizzy with emotion, wipes an eye, turning away. 
MARCUS You OK? 
STAR (shakes her head) Somebody used to sing that to me. 
MARCUS puts the phonebook aside, puts a hand on her arm; and she leans into him for a hug, tears forming in her eyes. 
STAR (cont'd) Stay with us, Marcus. Please.

MARCUS looks down at her, affected. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.   MOTEL - DAY 
AEROSTAT POV - a PIXELLATED ELECTRONIC IMAGE as it patrols the MOTEL AREA in its geometric pattern. It ZOOMS into the CARPORT, quickly scanning the abandoned VEHICLES, among which is an aged, open JEEP WRANGLER, its HOOD UP, parked beside a customized VAN. The cars are covered in DUST, the TIRES FLAT, they've been sitting here for a decade. 
OBJECTIVE ANGLE - the AEROSTAT zips off on its rounds. After a moment, the VAN DOOR slides open. MARCUS moves quickly back to the JEEP, KYLE and STAR behind him. 
STAR checks her WATCH while MARCUS goes back to work on the JEEP'S ENGINE. He's found some tools, already has removed and cleaned SPARK PLUGS, dismantled the DISTRIBUTOR. KYLE, meanwhile, returns to INFLATING one of the tires with a BICYCLE PUMP. 
KYLE If we get it to move, will you teach me to make it go? 
MARCUS It's called driving.   Sure. 
STAR wipes DIRT off the side of the VAN, revealing air- brushed ARTWORK beneath... 
STAR Wow.   What were these like? 
MARCUS looks up from his work to see-- 
A WHITE UNICORN in a FIELD OF FLOWERS. 
MARCUS (SMILING) Not too many around in my time. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.   MOTEL - NIGHT 
THE AEROSTAT zips past the CARPORT.   As soon as its gone-- 
STAR Now! 
THE JEEP is suddenly PUSHED from the carport, tires somewhat inflated. MARCUS is on one side of the rear, KYLE on the other, STAR behind the wheel, the seat moved all the way up. 
They get the vehicle to a slight SLOPE, it begins to roll on its own. 
MARCUS Pop the clutch! Let your foot up! 
ANGLE IN JEEP 
We see it's been hot-wired. STAR has her foot all the way down on the clutch, now lets up-- 
THE JEEP BUCKS and SPUTTERS... but CATCHES. As soon as it does, MUSIC BLARES from the tape deck-- raucous HEAVY METAL, the aged cassette SPEEDS and SLOWS. MARCUS runs for the driver's side, but the JEEP is pulling ahead fast. 
ANGLE IN JEEP 
STAR is staring at the speaker, mesmerized at the sound of the MUSIC. When she looks out the windshield-- 
--she's about to HIT A WALL, SQUEALS in terror-- 
--MARCUS vaults in and pushes her aside, squeezing behind the wheel, hitting the brakes and throwing the Jeep into neutral. 
KYLE Aerostat's coming!

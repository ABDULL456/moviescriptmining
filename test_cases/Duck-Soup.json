{"train": "This finishes on an operatic note with everybody with outstretched hands turned toward the main door that connects the reception hall with the outer hall. \nGroucho doesn't appear and once more they all sing. \nALL (singing) Hail, hail, Freedonia... Land of the brave and free. \nAgain Groucho fails to appear and they all sing once more. \nALL Hail, hail, Freedonia... Land of the brave and free. \nMrs. Teasdale exchanges an apprehensive glance with Bob. Vera and Trentino smile. \nMRS. TEASDALE (Nervously) I hope nothing has happened. \nBOB Mrs. Teasdale, I assure you there is nothing to worry about.  Father is probably taking extra care in getting into his robes of state.  I'll call him. \nBob goes over to a corner of the room and pulls a tapestried bell cord.  This rings a fire bell in Groucho's room -- and Groucho is disclosed asleep in his canopied bed under a mosquito netting.  He has an unlighted cigar in his mouth. The continued jangling of the fire bell awakens him from his slumber and he rises quickly.  The cigar begins to emit smoke when he starts puffing.  He hurries over to one corner of the room where his clothes are arranged in fireman fashion, gets into them, and then sides down a fireman's pole into the reception hall. \nThe guests are singing the last two lines of the national anthem when he arrives. \nALL Hail, hail, Freedonia... Land of the brave and free. \nGroucho starts across the hall in the direction of Mrs. Teasdale.  He passes several notables, one of whom is wearing an impressive looking medal.  Groucho deprives him of it without stopping his forward movement, and pins it on himself. He pauses only when he is facing the principal group. \nMRS.  TEASDALE (Beaming as she addresses Groucho) As chairwoman of the reception committee, I welcome you and extend the good wishes of every man, woman and child of Freedonia.  I deem it an honor on this momentous occasion... \nGROUCHO (Interrupting) Never mind that stuff... \nHe takes a pack of cards from is pocket and extends them to Mrs. Teasdale. \nGROUCHO Take a card. \nThe bewildered Mrs. Teasdale complies. \nGroucho puts the other fifty-one cards in his pocket. \nMRS. TEASDALE What'll I do with this card? \nGROUCHO You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying? \nMRS.  TEASDALE As chairwoman of the reception committee, I welcome you with open arms. \nGROUCHO How late do you stay open? \nMRS. TEASDALE In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for. \nGROUCHO (Throwing her a glance) And Vera niece, too. \nVERA Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom. \nGROUCHO You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? (Looking around) \nBob (ZEPPO) enters scene. \nBOB Here I am, Father. \nGROUCHO (To Bob) Take a letter. \nBOB (Taking out a stenographer's pad and pencil) Who to? \nGROUCHO The President of the United States. \nBob writes as Groucho dictates \nGROUCHO My dear President...  read it back... \nBOB (Reading from pad) \"My dear President\"... \nGROUCHO That doesn't sound right...  take out \"President\"...  now read it. \nBOB (Reading) \"My dear\"... \nGROUCHO That's not right yet... put back \"President\" and take out \"dear\"... How does it read now? \nBOB (Reading) \"My President\"... \nGROUCHO There's still something wrong with it... take out \"President\" ...now what've you got? \nBOB (Reading) \"My\"... \nGROUCHO Now we're on the right track... Put back \"dear\"... How does it read? \nBOB (Reading) \"My dear\"... \nGROUCHO You can't say that to the President... Put back \"President\"... Now let's hear how sounds. \nBOB (Reading) \"My dear President\"... \nGROUCHO That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail. \nBOB Is that all? \nGroucho does a dance with Mrs. Teasdale who joins him reluctantly and registers embarrassment as dance continues. He might finish dance in her arms, looking tenderly at her as she beams down at him. \nMRS. TEASDALE (As she beams on him) You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind. \nGROUCHO That's what I get for dressing in a hurry. \nMRS. TEASDALE Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready? \nGROUCHO I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats... (He takes a paper from inside pocket as he says above... then reads from paper) Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation -- \nMRS. TEASDALE Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg... \nGROUCHO (With a look of great surprise) He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son? \nBob enters \nBOB Here I am, Father... \nGROUCHO Send for my car... \nBOB (Calling to servant off scene) His Excellency's car! \nThis is repeated by a servant's voice off scene... \nA servant enters to Groucho, bearing his high silk hat. \nHe bows low as he hands it to Groucho... Groucho takes hat, removes a white rabbit, hands it back to servant, dons his hat and with a swanky gesture exits... again we hear a servant's voice calling: \"His Excellency's car\"... \nWe see the trumpeters at the top of the steps of the mansion, outside, standing at attention... their trumpets at their sides... \nFrom inside comes the voice of a servant calling \"His Excellency's car\"... \nThe trumpeters click their heels, draw themselves erect, put the trumpets to their mouths and blow a fanfare to summon the car... \nWe cut to the Exterior of the Dictator's garage.  This is a pretentious affair.  In central foreground a wall, in the center of which is a large wrought-iron double gate.  On each side of the gate is a crest or design in relief.  Also two liveried guards stand erect before the gate.  A trumpeter on the wall above.  Through the gate we see the patio and suggestions of the garage.  Two or three high-class cars in background identify the garage. \nAt the beginning of the scene, we hear finish of trumpeter's call.  Instantly the two guards move to the center of the gates and call through the bars - \nGUARDS (In unison) His Excellency's car! \nAlmost instantly there is a terrific roar of motors on the other side of the wall.  The two guards open gates moving in military manner.  Immediately the gates are wide open, Harpo appears on his motorcycle, that carries a side car. \nThe motorcycle is decorated... perhaps a crest in relief on the side of the car...  a thin staff, about four or five feet high is fastened to the handle bars...  As Harpo rides along, he hoists the Freedonian flag to the staff.  Further along the road he hits a man... he looks behind to see what damage he's done, but continues riding... A CUT BACK to the man shows that he is lying prostrate on the ground. \nWe CUT BACK to Harpo, who is just getting off motorcycle... he takes another look back at the man, lowers the flag to half-mast, takes bugle, which is hanging on his car and blows a few bars of taps... he mounts motorcycle again and starts off... \nBOB I object!...  we have no right to discuss this matter in the absence of my father. \nSPEAKER (To House) We have been meeting every morning for eight days and not once has His Excellency been on time... \nTRENTINO (Looking at his watch) Gentlemen, I cannot wait much longer... \nSPEAKER (To Bob) Would you mind calling your father again? \nBob presses a button, either on desk or wall... \nCUT TO - the corner of Groucho's bedroom, showing fireman's pole.  The sound of the clanging bell is heard over scene. \nGroucho hurries into scene, fully clad but for his coat which he has on his arm... without waiting to don his coat he slides down the pole.  We pick him up finishing the slide down the pole into the House of Representatives.  As he arrives the members are on their feet singing the last four bars of the national anthem. \nMEMBERS (Singing) HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA Land of the brave and free... \nGroucho hurries toward Speaker's desk, putting on his coat as he goes...  Just as he reaches the desk the singing subsides.  Groucho turns to the body of men and looks off in the direction of one of the representatives. \nGROUCHO (Pointing toward the individual off scene) The Secretary of Agriculture was a little flat... (He takes a match and scratches it across the top of the desk to light his cigar... takes a few puffs, then raps the gavel.) I move we open the morning session... Has anybody got a cork screw? (Looking out and around at members) \n[page missing] \nGROUCHO What's to stop you from digging one... And after you dig a river, how're ya gonna cross it without a bridge...? We've got to have a bridge to stop people from going places -- then we've gotta stop them from coming back.  If you're worried about the expense we can have a bridge with only one end -- and if that's a success we can do away with it altogether. I'm telling you that what this country needs is -- \nOff scene we hear Chico's voice singing \"P-E-A-N-U-T-S\"... this is followed by the piping of a whistle playing the first strain of the PEANUT VENDOR... \nGroucho listens, annoyed and then continues \nGROUCHO If there's one thing we don't need right now -- it's peanuts -- gentlemen, what good is a bridge if you haven't got ammunition to blow it up... ammunition was never cheaper...  Right now, you can get two cannons for the price of one and shoot twice as far for half the money...  With every five thousand dollar purchase we throw in a Big Bertha... If you don't like her, you can throw her right out again.  I tell you no country can protect itself without -- \nAgain Chico's voice comes over scene singing \"P-E-A-N-U-T- S\"...  The whistling of the first strain of song - the PEANUT VENDOR is heard again \nSPEAKER I'm sorry your Excellency, it is that infernal peanut vendor Chicolini... How can we accomplish anything with that constant annoyance? \nTRENTINO Your Excellency - are we or are we not going to discuss this problem - my time is valuable - I'm a man of few words - \nGROUCHO I'm a man of one word... SCRAM!!! \nTrentino exits resentfully \nGROUCHO (To Bob - aroused) Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts. \nBOB I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go - \nGROUCHO He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately. \nCHICO I don't call him, I whistle. \nGROUCHO What do you whistle? \nCHICO Yankee Poodle. \nGROUCHO I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him? \nCHICO I don't want him. \nGROUCHO Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound? \nCHICO He only weighs ten ounces -- \nGROUCHO I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside. \nGroucho turns and disappears from the window - CUT INSIDE of House of Representatives \nGROUCHO (To Bob) In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place? \nBOB (After a moment's thought) About - thirty-four seconds. \nGROUCHO We'll start a fire -- (Indicating representatives) -- and get rid of these microbes. \nGroucho exits towards door leading into his private office. CUT to inside of private office which has another door leading to a hallway, and among other articles of furniture, there is an impressive-looking desk on which is a telephone.  Just as Groucho comes through the door into his office, Chico enters through the other door.  He is wearing gauntlets, reaching half way up his arms.  As they walk toward each other the telephone rings and the two men make a mad  dash for the telephone on the desk.  Chico beats Groucho to the phone, picks up the receiver. \nCHICO (At telephone) Hello!...  Yes...  Yes...  He's not in... \nChico hangs up receiver and turns to Groucho who is waiting impatiently \nCHICO That was for you. \nGROUCHO I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling \"peanuts\" in front of the House of Representatives. \nCHICO Oh no, I can't do it. \nGROUCHO You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you? \nCHICO Sure.  How much does the job pay? (or) Sure, if there's a chance for advancement. \nGROUCHO You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel? \nCHICO 'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once. \nGROUCHO Did you shoot the rapids? \nGROUCHO Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war? \nCHICO Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody. \nGroucho suddenly slaps Chico across the face with his gloves, then as quickly brings to light a card which he presents to Chico in the professional manner of an experienced duelist \nGROUCHO My card. \nCHICO (Laughing) That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look -- (Puts his large gloves on the desk) I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted. \nGROUCHO Why wasn't I insulted? \nCHICO You was insulted, but you don't know it. \nGROUCHO (Indignantly) Then I demand an apology! \nCHICO That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap. \nGROUCHO You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?... (Enthusiastically) AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him? \nCHICO He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face. \nGROUCHO Why didn't his niece slap your face? \nCHICO She did. \nGROUCHO What did you say to her? \nChico whispers in Groucho's ear -- Groucho gives him an indignant look \nGROUCHO You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story? \nCHICO You told it to me. \nGROUCHO (Puzzled for a moment) Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me... I'm going right out and find Trentino.  You go right out and get yourself an army. \nChico turns to go - Groucho stops him \nGROUCHO Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have? \nCHICO I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs. \nAt this point Chico is at the door and exits - Groucho slams the door right in his face - then he walks over to the desk and sees the larger gauntlets.  He takes a swing with his own gloves, then takes a hefty swing with the gauntlet.  He leaves his own gloves on the desk and exits with the gauntlets in is hand. \nCUT outside.  Harpo is just pulling up to the curb in front of the House of Representatives, in his motorcycle and side car.  Groucho comes from the building wearing gauntlets, gets into the side car and with a dignified wave of his hand, says: \nTRENTINO (Furious, to Gloria) Can't we go some place where we can be alone? \nGROUCHO (To Mrs. Teasdale) What can this mug offer you?  Wealth and family.  I can't give you wealth... (Archly lifting his eyebrow) ...but we can have a little family of our own. \nMRS. TEASDALE (Coyly) Oh, Rufus! \nGROUCHO All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head. \nMRS. TEASDALE (Happily confused) Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say. \nGROUCHO I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place. (Turning to Trentino) Maybe you can suggest something. \nTRENTINO (Hotly) This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least... \nGROUCHO Well, why not say the least and get it over with? \nMRS. TEASDALE (Fearful) Gentlemen!  Gentlemen! \nTRENTINO (Half addressing Mrs. Teasdale) I didn't come here to be insulted. \nGROUCHO That's what you think. \nTRENTINO (Furiously) You swine! \nGROUCHO Give me that again! \nTRENTINO You worm! \nGROUCHO Once more! (Holds his gauntlets in his hand, ready at any moment to strike) \nTRENTINO You upstart! \nGROUCHO That's it!  No man lives who can call a Firefly an upstart. \nWithout further ado, Groucho strikes Trentino across the face with his gauntlets.  Then he quickly flashes his card and extends it to Trentino in the manner of a duelist. \nGROUCHO (As he offers the card) Touch\u00e9. \nA sudden ripple of excitement as the guests, attracted by the rumpus begin to move into the scene.  Prominent among these is Vera Trentino.  Trentino refuses Groucho's card, white with rage. \nTRENTINO (Coldly) I shall report this indignity the my President. (To Mrs. Teasdale - polite but firm) Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war. \nMRS. TEASDALE (Half crying) This is terrible! \nVERA Uncle, you can't do this! \nINSERT of newspaper.  The newspaper moves up to CAMERA from background -- as it stops we read the following headlines: \n\"ARMIES MOBILIZE AS WAR CLOUDS GATHER!\" \nThrough this insert we get the vague impression of war activity.  We see the movement of soldiers' feet.  From the background the second insert moves up to CAMERA... \nThe first insert moves past CAMERA and the second insert comes from the background.  The headline reads: \n\"AMNESIA HASTENS PREPARATIONS!\" \nThrough this insert we see the heavy wheels of army wagons moving along.  This is replaced by the the insert coming from the background.  The headlines read - \n\"FREEDONIA'S LEADER MAINTAINS ATTITUDE OF DIGNIFIED SILENCE!\" \nBombing planes move through this insert.  The front page of the paper is turned and followed by a few other pages until we come to the classified ad section of the paper.  We see the following advertisement: \nWANTED: - A female spy. \nMust be young and attractive Apply to Office of Secretary of War. \nAbove this ad we just see a few lines of another ad -- \nWANTED: -- A Chauffeur Below the war nurse ad we see part of another ad in which a cook is wanted. \nDISSOLVE TO \nA SHOT (in movement) of a row of shapely legs, obviously those of very pretty girls.  The CAMERA moves upward disclosing the faces of the girls, who are sitting in a row in the ante-room of the Secretary of War's office.  On the door leading to the Secretary's private office, we see the lettering: PRIVATE.  The CAMERA discloses only four or five of these girls, but we know there are more in the room.  Bob appears in the doorway leading to the Secretary's office and addresses the first girl - nearest the door. \nBOB The Secretary of War will see you next, Miss. \nThis girl is very pretty and has a very attractive form. \nShe smiles at Bob, rises and exits into the Secretary's office.  Bob closes the door behind her.  The CAMERA now moves along the row of girls and the sixth or seventh girl in the row is Harpo, dressed as a girl.  On the other side of him are more girls.  A girl to the right of him turns to the girl beside her. \nGIRL (To the girl at her right) Did you hear the one about the woman taking a bath?... Well, she forgot to lock the door... A man came in and said, \"I'm a doctor\"... The woman said, \"I'm not sick\"... and the man said, \"that's all right.  I'm not a doctor.\" \nAll of the girls laugh heartily at at this remark. \nHarpo is laughing also.  He slaps the story-teller on the leg. \nHer laughter ceases instantly.  She slaps him back, and gets another slap on the leg in return.  A little squeal of pain from her and she raises her dress disclosing a bruise on her leg just above the knee. \nGIRL (To Harpo) Look! \nHarpo does so, then pulls up his own dress and points to his leg for her to look.  On his leg is tattooed a picture of two hearts entwined with an arrow running through both.  She gives Harpo dirty look and rises \nCHICO Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing? \nAt this point, Harpo makes his entrance through the door, carrying his unusually large pocketbook which is about the size of a carpetbag.   He walks past Groucho in a seductive manner, swinging his bag and rolling his eyes flirtatiously. Groucho is delighted with this action and returns the ogling. \nCHICO (To Harpo) Have you got any credentials? \nHarpo lifts his dress and shows them the tattoo on his leg of the two hearts.  Groucho examines it closely. \nGROUCHO I don't go in much for modern art. Have you got anything by one of the old masters? \nHarpo lifts his dress above the other leg and shows a picture of Gainsborough's \"Blue Boy\".  Chico and Groucho arise from the examination. \nGROUCHO I'm glad I didn't ask you for \"Washington Crossing the Delaware\". \nCHICO (To Harpo) We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love? \nHarpo walks over to Chico, throws his arms around him and starts to give him a big hug. He squeezes him very hard.  In the midst of this there is a loud report. \nA startled look from Groucho and Chico.  We see that Harpo is minus one breast.  He tries to affect an innocent look when suddenly there is a second loud report and his breasts are now as flat as a billiard table. \nJust as he turns to hide the sight from Chico and Groucho, a hissing sound is heard -- the air is leaking out of his bustle and the bustle is becoming deflated.) \nGROUCHO (To Harpo) You ought to carry a spare. \nHarpo goes to a corner of the room and keeps his back to CAMERA.  He takes a tube out of his dress front and begins to blow.  Chico and Groucho wear a puzzled look as they watch him - the bustle starts to expand. \nThis inflation continues to gigantic proportions as they look on. \nGROUCHO (Looking at Harpo) We're certainly living in a marvelous age. \nThere is a terrific explosion and all of Harpo's clothes are blown off him - leaving him in nothing but running pants and ladies' silk stockings.  His body is literally covered with tattoos. \nCHICO (Laughing) That's very funny... he certainly fooled me.  He'll make a good spy. \nWinks significantly at Harpo.  Harpo returns the wink. \nGROUCHO (Examining tattoos) If we can't use him as a spy, we can have him framed. \nHe and Chico continue further examination of the tattooed designs on Harpo's body. \nCHICO Say, that's a nice collection.  You oughta have a catalogue. \nHarpo pulls a catalogue from under the belt of his trunks and hands it to Chico.  Groucho and Chico look at the catalogue. \nGROUCHO Let's take a look at number eighteen. \nIn the absence of Mrs. Teasdale, Vera is seated by fireplace while Ambassador Trentino is excitedly pacing up and down... \nTRENTINO This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool... \nVERA I thought everything was working out fine. \nTRENTINO Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly. \nVERA Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to -- \nAt this point Trentino sees Mrs. Teasdale coming downstairs and hushes Vera with a nudge. \nMRS. TEASDALE (As she descends stairs) I'm so sorry I've kept you waiting... \nTrentino walks over to meet her. \nTRENTINO (Taking her hand) Mrs. Teasdale... (Kisses her hand) I deeply regret the unfortunate affair with his Excellency, but his attitude left me no alternative... \nMRS.  TEASDALE (Emotionally) To think that this should happen after all these years of friendship. \nVERA Maybe the war can still be averted... \nMRS. TEASDALE (Hopefully) Oh, if only it could... \nTRENTINO Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency. \nMRS. TEASDALE (Solicitously) Oh, would you...? \nTRENTINO For you, I would do anything... (Bowing graciously) \nVERA If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason... \nTRENTINO (To Mrs. Teasdale) Perhaps he will listen to you... \nMRS.  TEASDALE Perhaps...  I'll call him... \nShe goes the phone... as she starts to dial the number there is a quick CUT to Trentino and Vera who are exchanging significant looks... \nCUT BACK to Mrs. Teasdale at phone... \nMRS. TEASDALE (Talking into phone) Hello, your Excellency?...  I hate to disturb you -- I know you're a very busy man, but I must see you at once. \nCUT TO Groucho at other end of telephone...  He is lying in bed, in his flannel nightgown, eating crackers...  the bed is strewn with cracker boxes and crackers... \nGROUCHO (Into phone) Why not come over here? -- You can come in the back way and no one'll see you... \nPREMIER DANSEUSE \nVERA TRENTINO \nDISSOLVE - Through program to stage of opera house - company singing aria from some well-known opera.  CUT TO orchestra box nearest proscenium arch.  Harpo and Chico are there fast asleep leaning on each other.  They are dressed in Inverness capes - wearing their high hats.  Chico has a red band across his shirt-front on which is embossed \"Secretary of War\" in gold letters.  An usher enters box with two people in the background. \nUSHER (To Chico and Harpo) I'm sorry gentlemen - but you have the wrong seats. \nCHICO (Awakening) That's all right.  We're not enjoying ourselves anyway. \nUSHER You belong in that box over there - (Pointing to vacant box on opposite side of house - orchestra box) \nCHICO (To Harpo) Come on -- \nThey both step out of box, onto stage and stroll casually across as singing is going on.  Part of the way across, Harpo and Chico react to the singing of a very high note -- it's practically in Harpo's ear.  He stops -- makes a terrible face -- takes out ear-muffs, puts them on his ears and he and Chico continue toward the box -- \nCUT TO other box -- the one that Chico and Harpo are headed for.  Mrs. Teasdale and guests are being ushered in... \nChico and Harpo come into scene, arriving at box.  Chico steps into box from stage.  Harpo is about to follow when he spies a pretty girl in box above.  He starts climbing up the proscenium arch to upper box -- the girl sees him, screams and dashes out of box.  Harpo completes climb into box -- at this point the singing has just finished and applause breaks out. \nHarpo acknowledges the applause as if it was in appreciation of his climb -- after a few quick bows he starts out of the box after the girl.  As he is running out of box into the foyer he bumps into Ambassador Trentino. \nTRENTINO (Stopping him) Wait a minute... Mrs. Teasdale is in the box below.  The plans of war are in her purse -- you've got to get them -- I don't care how, but get them -- and when you do, bring them to 492 North Myrtle Road -- you'd better write that down. \nHarpo takes out a pencil with heavy lead and writes the address on the white and purple-edged silk band which is across Trentino's shirt bosom.  Then he pushes Trentino's coat aside and from under his vest pulls the ribbon in the manner of a ticker tape -- tears it off -- and starts back to box. \nCUT TO \nLOWER BOX \nMRS. TEASDALE I wonder what's keeping His Excellency? \nCHICO Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook? \nMRS. TEASDALE Yes -- why? \nCHICO I wanna powder my nose... \nMrs. Teasdale laughs good-naturedly and puts the purse behind her between her back and the back of the chair...  as we go to stage where the shooting of the apple in \"William Tell\" is being enacted.  William Tell is just placing the apple on his son's head -- he turns his back on his son and walks toward opposite side of stage with bow and arrow. \nCUT TO \nUPPER BOX \nHarpo takes a look at apple on the boy's head -- reaches down in box and comes up with a bow and arrow.  He takes a good aim and lets the arrow fly...  It hits its mark and the apple falls to the ground.  William Tell, having arrived at spot from which he's going to shoot, turns to take aim and sees that the apple is gone.  He picks up another, at the base of an apple tree and starts in direction of his son. \nHERO (Continuing singing) Fetch my boots -- (Harpo throws boots on stage Hero continues) Bring me my sword -- (Harpo throws a sword on stage --) \nHero continues his song while Harpo litters the stage with various articles - a saddle - a chair, etc... \nCUT TO box below - Chico is trying to reach for pocketbook on ledge but can't get it.  He whistles up to Harpo.  Harpo looks down and Chico pantomimes to him to get the pocketbook, pointing to it.  The singing stops and aplause follows -- the orchestra starts a selection -- which continues through following routine without any singing. \nCUT TO box above.  Harpo takes out a fishing pole with a reel on it -- he unwinds reel and the line descends \nnear box below and lands in a man's hair -- the man occupies an aisle seat in the orchestra -- near Teasdale box. \nCUT TO Harpo reeling in.  CUT TO man on aisle seat -- The hook has caught onto his toupe and its being pulled off his head.  CUT TO Harpo reeling in with great satisfaction in the belief that he has the purse -- on the end of the line comes the toupe.  Harpo, astonished, looks down on the victim who, minus the toupe, now displays a shiny bald pate. \nHarpo takes out his fountain pen and releases gadget. The ink pours down on the bald spot of the man below and spreads into the form of a toupe parted in the middle.  CUT BACK to Harpo - he places the toupe on the bare back side of a figure of Cupid carved on the arch.  He is now suddenly attracted by something on the stage -- it is a pool with a practical fountain in its center.  Harpo digs into a decorative flower box set in a groove in the proscenium arch. \nHe brings out a real live worm and baits his hook -- stands up and casts... the line swishes through the air and the hook lands in the pool on the stage.  The line instantly tightens and a large carp fish is yanked out of the pool... as the line is drawn in the fish nearly hits Mrs. Teasdale. \nShe covers her face with her hands.  Chico takes advantage of her action, grabs the line, removes the fish, and puts hook on handle of purse...  then signals Harpo with a whistle and in the manner of a construction foreman, motions to him to start \"hoisting\".  The line becomes taut and the purse is yanked out of view.  Mrs. Teasdale uncovers her face and discovers that the purse is missing. \nMRS.  TEASDALE (Hysterically) My purse -- my purse is gone! \nThere is a buzz of excitement among the rest of the guests as they help Mrs. Teasdale look for the purse. \nChico joins in the search.  He grabs an elderly dignified man in the party, throws back his coat and starts to frisk him. \nCHICO He no got it --- \nAs he turns to frisk another man, Mrs. Teasdale says \nMRS. TEASDALE This is dreadful -- I must see His Excellency at once --- (She exits from box) \nCUT TO ballet dancers' dressing room, where we find Groucho still pumping away on Vera Trentino's leg --- \nVERA Are you sure you're not tired? \nGROUCHO Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week - \nMrs. Teasdale enters the scene.  The sight shocks her but she recovers herself sufficiently to hide the embarrassment. \nMRS. TEASDALE I hope I'm not interrupting. \nGROUCHO (Still pumping - looks over his shoulder at Mrs. Teasdale) Take a seat -- you're next. (He lets go of Vera's leg - and she exits) \nMRS. TEASDALE Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened. \nGROUCHO That's all right.  I'll fix you right up. \nShe hands the papers to Harpo over Groucho's shoulder as she dances with him... Groucho rushes to Harpo and they do a twirl together.  Harpo hands the paper to Chico over Groucho's shoulder.  Groucho rushes at Chico and twirls with him - Chico in trying to pass the papers to Vera drops them on the floor.  They all make a dive for them.  Groucho gets the papers and dashes with them to the lower box just as Mrs. Teasdale enters same. \nThe following is a close shot of Groucho and Mrs. Teasdale. The latter standing on stage right by the box. \nGROUCHO (Handing paper to Mrs. Teasdale) Here -- put these plans where no one will ever find them - sleep on them. \nCUT TO - Dressing room just a Vera, Chico and Harpo enter. \nVERA (Apologetically) I'm sorry boys -- I did my best -- it's all my fault. \nCHICO It's not-a your fault.  It's-a his fault -- (Indicating Harpo; then to Harpo accusingly) I fix it for you to getta the plans -- you getta the plans -- then you losa- a the plans -- now we no gotta the plans of war... \nHarpo lifts up his shirt and tattooed upon him is the reproduction of the war plans... \nFADE OUT \nEND OF SEQUENCE \"F\" \nSEQUENCE \"G\" \nFADE IN - Mrs. Teasdale's living room.  Night.  Subdued light. We begin with an EXTREME CLOSE CLOSE SHOT of a hand depositing the plans of war in a vault.  This vault is about the height of a man, the door flush with wall.  The CAMERA TRUCKS back and discloses that the one depositing the papers is Mrs. Teasdale -- she is in negligee.  She closes the vault door, pulls a cord, closing a pair of drapes which hide the vault. The CAMERA PANS to the balcony above where Vera Trentino, also in negligee, is watching the action in the living room below.  She tiptoes quietly from the scene. \nDownstairs, Mrs. Teasdale turns out the center table light and moves toward the stairway. \nCUT TO Vera Trentino's bedroom.  Vera comes toward window, raises it quietly and waves a handkerchief, evidently signalling somebody below. \nCUT TO EXTERIOR of house.  Chico and Harpo are waving back to signify that they have caught the signal.  The boys try to raise the window which is located next to the main entrance, but it is locked and they can't budge it. \nCHICO (Peeved) It's all your fault. Now we gotta steal the plans again -- You had 'em on you... you take a bath... and now we no gotta plans of war. \nThey try the window again and find it hopeless \nCHICO (To Harpo) You wait here -- I'll let you in. \nChico walks right in through the door, closes it behind him and then appears at the window.  He raises it from the inside and Harpo climbs in through the window and joins Chico. \nCUT TO INSIDE.  They are walking cautiously across the room when they hear the following coming over scene -- \"Psst... Psst...\"  They stop and look around, trying to locate the source of the sound.  We CUT TO the balcony and see Vera Trentino, still dressed in her negligee.  Once more she tries to attract them. \nVERA Psst... \nThe boys look up and see her. \nVERA (In a half whisper - mysteriously) In the safe -- behind the drapes -- (Pointing in the direction of the safe) \nCHICO (Also in a half whisper) All right -- I'll meet you behind the drapes. \nCHICO (Exasperated) Hey, you never get the safe open that way. (Looking up at Vera's room) We gotta try the combination...  You gotta the combination? \nHarpo nods and takes from under his coat a woman's silk combination... winks and looks back in the direction of Vera's room...  Chico snatches it out of his hand and throws it away. \nDuring above Mrs. Teasdale has come out on balcony, sees the boys but can't distinguish them in the room which is practically in darkness except for a few splotches of moonlight.  She runs back into her room... \nCUT TO Mrs. Teasdale's room...  she is at telephone dialing a number... \nMRS. TEASDALE (After a slight nervous pause) Hello?  Your Excellency?  There are burglars in the house...  I want you to come right over. \nCUT TO Groucho's bedroom.  He is at the other end of the phone in bed. \nGROUCHO (Into phone) You come over here.  There are no burglars in my house. \nCUT BACK to Mrs. Teasdale at phone. \nMRS. TEASDALE (Into phone) But Your Excellency, you must -- I tell you there are burglars here... Oh, thank you...  Please hurry... \nCUT TO Chico and Harpo in living room below at safe. \nHarpo has just finished putting a stick of dynamite in the door of safe... \nCHICO Light it... Now we blow him up... \nHarpo strikes a match, but Chico stops him from lighting it. \nCHICO Wait a minute... we gotta fix it so it don't make-a so much noise... What-a we do? \nHarpo takes out a large wad of cotton, tears it, hands two pieces to Chico... they both stuff their ears with large pieces. \nCHICO That's fine... Now, nobody hear the noise. \nHarpo lights fuse... each stands on either side of safe door waiting for the explosion... after a slight pause, there is a terrific blast of sound... and the screen is masked with smoke.  The smoke clears away and the safe door falls to the floor.  Groucho walks out of the safe putting the plans of war in his inside pocket... \nAfter a few steps he stops and addresses the boys... \nGROUCHO That woman is crazy... there are no burglars around here... \nFADE OUT \nEND OF SEQUENCE \"G\" \nSEQUENCE  \"H\" \nFADE IN - to insert of newspaper which comes from background to CAMERA.  A screaming headline reads: \nCHICO Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning. \nAt this point, an unusually large shell comes crashing from above, imbedding itself, point down, in the floor without exploding.  Groucho and Chico rush over to look at it. \nGROUCHO (Looking at shell) Acme Ammunition Company, eh?  How do you expect to win the war with shells that don't go off?  Now, if you were buying your stuff from me, you wouldn't have that trouble.  Eureka Ammunition is guaranteed to explode -- or your money back.  Let me show you some samples. \nGroucho opens door and yells to some one outside \nGROUCHO Bring in No. 47, line 8. \nHarpo enters, bent forward, tugging at a rope which tightens over his shoulder, in the manner of a Volga Boatman... at the end of the rope is a cannon, on two wheels \nGROUCHO (Pointing to gun) That's our latest number...  our sixteen-inch Horowitz gun. (To Harpo) Load it up. \nHarpo pours a great quantity of powder into the cannon, then to make sure he has enough, he lights a match and looks into the hole.  Groucho takes the lighted match from Harpo.  He lights his own cigar, hands the match back to Harpo.  Harpo pours in a little more powder, makes sure he has enough, then proceeds to ram the powder in the barrel with his horn. He rises and moves to wall toward which the cannon is pointed. He draws a target on the wall with a piece of chalk -- goes back to cannon.  He picks up the firing string, and faces the target toward which the cannon is pointing.  Chico puts his fingers into his ears.  Groucho picks up a pencil from desk - taps it on desk - then raises both hands, in the manner of an orchestra leader.  He holds this pose for a second - and on the down beat, Harpo jerks the string and there is a terrific explosion.  The cannon fires out the back end instead of the front and blows a hole through the back wall.  The two stare off in the direction of the hole.  Groucho turns to Chico. \nGROUCHO With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men. \nCHICO That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them. \nGROUCHO Anything else? (Writing order on pad) \nCHICO (Mentally figuring) Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches. \nGROUCHO (Writing) Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys? \nCHICO Fine.  We gotta him. (He indicates Harpo) \nGROUCHO So! -- He's on your side, too. \nCHICO Sure. \nGROUCHO Well, with you two fellows on the other side, this country should have no trouble keeping the wolf from the door. \nHarpo opens the door and discloses a dozen or more snarling wolves at the door. \nCUT TO - INTERIOR enemy headquarters.   The booming of distant guns comes over the scene.  Trentino is there with a Sylvanian general. \nGENERAL Something must be done immediately. The soldiers are getting discouraged. \nTRENTINO There's only one thing to do... we must capture Firefly. \nGENERAL But how?  It's a very dangerous undertaking. \nTRENTINO (Standing near widow) Ask for volunteers.  Some one must make the sacrifice -- someone -- (Stops to gaze out of window attracted by off scene roar of motor) Here comes Chicolini.  Maybe he'll do it. (Walks away from window) Unless we can make Firefly our prisoner, we're lost. \nChico and Harpo are standing at the open door looking down. \nCHICO Look!  That's-a Firefly's headquarters. (Pointing down) We catch him right now. \nHarpo reaches back into the cabin, picks up an enormous hook and throws it out.  The rope that is attached to the hook starts playing out rapidly. \nCUT TO -- \nLONG SHOT miniature of dirigible and rope dangling from it... \nThen CUT TO - SHOT of rope and hook as it approaches Groucho's headquarters.  It hooks onto the roof of the shack and raises it off the ground.  CUT TO - \nLONG SHOT - miniature of dirigible carrying the shack through the air. \nCUT TO - inside of headquarters. \nGROUCHO (To generals) Gentlemen, the overhead is killing us.  Everything is going up.  If we don't watch ourselves, we'll come down with a crash.  Now -- all those in favor of taking a cut say \"aye\"... \nONE GENERAL (Protesting) But Your Excellency! \nGROUCHO Carried unanimously. \nCUT TO - SHOT of dirigible carrying the shack. \nThe shack just clears a steeple by a few inches. \nCUT TO - INSIDE of headquarters. \nGROUCHO Now go right out there and fight. (To one general) You go out there and relieve General Beauregard, and while you're at it, see what General Motors is doing. \nThe general, without saluting, exits out of door and closes door behind him. \nGROUCHO (To another general) Call him back -- he didn't salute me. \nThe second general exits out of door without saluting, closing door behind him. \nZEPPO Father, he didn't salute you either. \nGROUCHO (Angrily) Attention! \nThe remaining generals jump to their feet, stand at attention and salute. \nGROUCHO Go out there -- all of you -- and bring those generals back -- dead or alive. \nAll of the generals exit through to door; the last one closing door behind him. \nFADE IN - to a group of notables standing around a large table.  Among them are Mrs. Teasdale and Zeppo.  Groucho is the guest of honor, very gaily attired for the occasion. \nAs we FADE INTO this scene, they are singing - \nALL (Singing) Hail, hail, Freedonia...  Land of the brave and free! \nZEPPO My dad is much too great for his position without a question.  I'd like to offer this with your permission as a suggestion: I really think he should be king! \nALL We really think he should be king! \nZEPPO I really think he should be king! \nALL He should be king! \nSOLO And wear a crown and everything. \nALL And everything. \nSOLO I really think he should be king! \nALL He should be king! \nGROUCHO From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king! \nALL He should be king! \nGROUCHO And wear a crown and everything. \nALL And everything.  He should be king! \nThen follows a musical interlude during which Groucho says: - \nGROUCHO (Speaking to audience) You know I think they think I should be king. (Then turning to the guests - singing) Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong. \nMRS. TEASDALE The king can do no wrong! \nALL The king can do no wrong!  The king can do no wrong! \nThey all sit \nGROUCHO Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong \nALL (Standing up) The king can do no wrong! (They all sit down) \nGROUCHO Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong. \n", "test1_input": "THE BREAKFAST CLUB \nDuck Soup (1933) \nScreenplay by \nHarry Ruby, Bert Kalmar and Grover Jones \nThe story begins with an opening shot on the exterior of the executive mansion.  It is a gala day.  Soldiers are lined up in front of the entrance; expensive cars and carriages are arriving and depositing distinguished notables from the adjoining countries.  Two trumpeters at the head of the stairs announce the arrival of each notable. \nIn the large reception hall, Mrs. Teasdale, wife of the late president, is greeting the newcomers.  The room is filled with distinguished guests.  At the moment we see Mrs. Teasdale, she is talking with a notable.  In the near background is a group of distinguished men, members of her own cabinet.  Her words to the notable are not lost on them, and as she begins to praise the new dictator, there is the exchange of disapproving glances. \nMRS. TEASDALE It is so good of you to come. \nNOTABLE An honor, Mrs. Teasdale...  You must indeed have great faith in your new dictator to give him such a magnificent reception. \nMRS. TEASDALE I feel that Rufus T. Firefly is the only logical successor to my dear departed husband.  He has the statesmanship of Gladstone, the humility of Lincoln, and the wisdom of Pericles. \nThe notable kisses her hand once more and leaves the scene. As he does, the background group moves into Mrs. Teasdale. Their spokesman addresses Mrs. Teasdale. \nFIRST CABINET MEMBER (Protestingly) Mrs. Teasdale, as members of Freedonia's cabinet, we do not approve of your choice.  Who is this Rufus T. Firefly? \nSECOND CABINET MEMBER (Waving aloft a paper) A stranger in our midst, an agent for the Eureka Ammunition Company. Think of it, Gentlemen, an ammunition salesman dictating the policies of our peace-loving country. \nTHIRD CABINET MEMBER Reconsider, Mrs. Teasdale, before it is too late.  The citizens of Freedonia want a President! \nMRS. TEASDALE As the widow of your last president, I have the right to choose -- and, Gentlemen, I refuse to discuss the matter any further. \nMrs Teasdale turns her back on them, leaving them to mumble among themselves. \nFrom off scene comes a servant's voice, announcing: \nSERVANT His Excellency, Ambassador Verdi Trentino of Amnesia! \nCut... to the archway.  We see Trentino enter with a beautiful brunette at his side.  He is followed by two or three of his fellowmen.  He moves across the reception hall to Mrs. Teasdale, bows most graciously and presses his lips to the back of her hand, then introduces his companion. \nTRENTINO Mrs. Teasdale... my niece, Vera. \nMrs. Teasdale shakes the girl's hand warmly. \nMRS. TEASDALE (To niece) Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid -- \nTRENTINO (Lightly) What is money? (Tenderly) Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything. \nMRS. TEASDALE (Flustered) Ambassador! (Attempting to change the subject) I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator. \n", "test1_true": "Trentino attempts to take her hand.  The latter is a bit confused, much to the amusement of Vera, who laughingly says: \nVERA Mrs. Teasdale, my uncle's hopeless -- you've been the only topic of conversation ever since we left Amnesia. \nMrs. Teasdale's confusion is happily interrupted by the announcement of a servant, off scene. \nSERVANT The Honorable Mohamed Pandooh of Mufhtan! \nMRS. TEASDALE (Hastily) Oh, I must greet His Honor. \nMrs. Teasdale exits from the scene quickly.  Vera and Trentino look after her, then Vera laughs softly, as their eyes meet. \nVERA So that's the one you want to marry. \nTRENTINO With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- (He rubs his hands significantly) \nVERA Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly. \nTRENTINO That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece. \nVera winks agreeingly. \nMrs. Teasdale enters the scene with Bob Firefly (ZEPPO). \nShe introduces him. \nMRS. TEASDALE I want you to meet the son of His Excellency -- Bob Firefly... \nAmbassador Trentino... his niece, Vera, After the formalities of introducing, Trentino says: \nTRENTINO Isn't it about time for the ceremony to begin, Mrs. Teasdale? (Mockingly) I do hope His Excellency won't be late. \nBOB (Defensively) My father makes it a point to always be on time.  As long as I've known him, he's never been late for an appointment. \nTRENTINO But it's two minutes of ten now. \nBOB (As music begins) His Excellency is due To take his station.  Beginning his new Administration...  He'll make his appearance when The clock on the wall strikes ten. \nMRS. TEASDALE (singing) When the clock on the wall strikes ten All you loyal ladies and you patriotic men Let's sing the national anthem when...  The clock on the wall strikes ten. \nThe clock begins to strike the hour...  one...  two... three...  four... \nALL (singing) Hail, hail, Freedonia...  Mightiest of mighty nations!

TEASDALE (Excited - almost hysterical) Yes, it's awful! (To Groucho) Are you sure you did the right thing? \nGROUCHO Of course.  Who ever heard of calling off a war after ordering all the ammunition? \nBy this tine Vera has descended the stairs and exited from scene.  Groucho looks around the room furtively to make sure he is not being observed and takes a large envelope from his inside pocket. \nGROUCHO The plans of war are in this envelope. I want you to take care of them -- no one will ever suspect you. \nHe hands papers to her \nCUT TO Vera lingering on stairs looking down on the scene below.  Having heard the conversation, she exits from scene, and we CUT down stairs to Groucho and Mrs. Teasdale. \nGROUCHO Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.

The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness... \nMRS.

Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.

TEASDALE Well, if you must go -- \nShe picks up Groucho's hat and hands it to him.  He removes a white rabbit from hat and gives it to her.  He is about to put the hat on his head when something in the hat attracts his attention.  He empties six baby rabbits out of the hat onto the table; puts his hat on and exits. \nCUT TO outside of house just as Harpo is pulling up to the curb in his motorcycle and sidecar.  Groucho comes out of house and walks directly to motorcycle. \nGROUCHO (To Harpo) I'm not taking any more chances. You sit in the sidecar... \nHarpo gets off seat and sits in sidecar.

DISSOLVE from this to interior of Groucho's headquarters behind the front - a wooden shack. The sound of a distant booming of guns is heard over this scene.  On the wall is a large war map with colored thumb tacks indicating the positions of Groucho's men and the enemy. \nGroucho, in the uniform of a Confederate General, (a Robert E. Lee make-up), is studying the war map with a few of his Generals. \nGROUCHO (Looking at a tack in a distant sector) Either there's a fly in the room or we've got a soldier in Africa. \nThe door flies open and Bob, in a snappy uniform, enters excitedly and breathlessly.

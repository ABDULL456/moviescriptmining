{"test1_input": "CHICO Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing? \nAt this point, Harpo makes his entrance through the door, carrying his unusually large pocketbook which is about the size of a carpetbag.   He walks past Groucho in a seductive manner, swinging his bag and rolling his eyes flirtatiously. Groucho is delighted with this action and returns the ogling. \nCHICO (To Harpo) Have you got any credentials? \nHarpo lifts his dress and shows them the tattoo on his leg of the two hearts.  Groucho examines it closely. \nGROUCHO I don't go in much for modern art. Have you got anything by one of the old masters? \nHarpo lifts his dress above the other leg and shows a picture of Gainsborough's \"Blue Boy\".  Chico and Groucho arise from the examination. \nGROUCHO I'm glad I didn't ask you for \"Washington Crossing the Delaware\". \nCHICO (To Harpo) We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love? \nHarpo walks over to Chico, throws his arms around him and starts to give him a big hug. He squeezes him very hard.  In the midst of this there is a loud report. \nA startled look from Groucho and Chico.  We see that Harpo is minus one breast.  He tries to affect an innocent look when suddenly there is a second loud report and his breasts are now as flat as a billiard table. \nJust as he turns to hide the sight from Chico and Groucho, a hissing sound is heard -- the air is leaking out of his bustle and the bustle is becoming deflated.) \nGROUCHO (To Harpo) You ought to carry a spare. \nHarpo goes to a corner of the room and keeps his back to CAMERA.  He takes a tube out of his dress front and begins to blow.  Chico and Groucho wear a puzzled look as they watch him - the bustle starts to expand. \nThis inflation continues to gigantic proportions as they look on. \nGROUCHO (Looking at Harpo) We're certainly living in a marvelous age. \nThere is a terrific explosion and all of Harpo's clothes are blown off him - leaving him in nothing but running pants and ladies' silk stockings.  His body is literally covered with tattoos. \nCHICO (Laughing) That's very funny... he certainly fooled me.  He'll make a good spy. \nWinks significantly at Harpo.  Harpo returns the wink. \nGROUCHO (Examining tattoos) If we can't use him as a spy, we can have him framed. \nHe and Chico continue further examination of the tattooed designs on Harpo's body. \nCHICO Say, that's a nice collection.  You oughta have a catalogue. \nHarpo pulls a catalogue from under the belt of his trunks and hands it to Chico.  Groucho and Chico look at the catalogue. \nGROUCHO Let's take a look at number eighteen. \n", "test1_true": "CHICO (Referring to picture of girl) Say, she's all right.  You got-a her phone number? \nHarpo raises one arm and shows the phone number tattooed right under the arm pit.  He holds this a moment, then turns and discloses a portion of the tattooing on his chest. Groucho and Chico's eyes shift from the telephone number to the tattooed picture on his chest.  Harpo completes move and discloses the entire picture.  It is a country back-house with a crescent over the door.  Chico laughs uproariously. \nCHICO (Laughing) That's a funny one! \nHe slaps Harpo an the back good-naturedly. \nTRICK SHOT on HARPO'S CHEST.  The door in the outhouse flies open.  The head of a real man appears in the opening.  He looks off in the direction of Chico and mumbles incoherencies under his breath. \nHe is terribly angry at being interrupted.  He draws in his head, closing the door behind him. \nCHICO (To Harpo) I think we can use you.  Here's a spy glass... go ahead and do some spying... \nHarpo takes the glasses and goes directly toward the window. As he looks across street through binoculars, he is grinning all over and wiggling around like a happy kid. \nROOM ACROSS THE STREET \nLooking into the open window of a bedroom as Harpo would see it through the binoculars.  A beautiful girl is undressing, preparing to retire.  After a moment of this shot CUT BACK to Harpo looking through the binoculars.  Chico takes the binoculars from Harpo and pushes him out of the scene, proceeds to look himself.  He registers the same satisfaction as Harpo and hands the binoculars to Groucho.  As Groucho looks through the binoculars at the beautiful girl, Chico says: \nCHICO He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day. \nGROUCHO (Turning and looking at Chico) That's not bad for any day. \nGroucho takes a second look through the binoculars at the beautiful girl.  This time he sees Harpo chasing the girl around the roam.  This is shot through the binoculars as before.  Groucho registers amazement as he looks through binoculars; perhaps squints his eyes once or twice and takes second look. \nGROUCHO (To Chico) Maybe my eyes are bad - you take a look. \nChico takes the binoculars and looks at the room across the street.  Binocular shot as before.  The girl is in her underwear, tearing out of the room into the hall, pursued by Harpo.  Chico is still looking through the binoculars. \nGROUCHO You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something. \nCHICO I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something... \nCUT TO the front of the building occupied by the beautiful girl.  She comes dashing madly out of the door and starts down the street, clad only in her underwear.  Harpo appears in doorway, riding his motorcycle and starts down the street after her. \nFADE OUT \nEND OF SEQUENCE \"D\" \nSEQUENCE \"E\" \nFADE IN to living room of Mrs. Teasdale's home...  It is a smartly appointed room.  Its main feature for our purposes is a winding stairway leading to bedrooms above. \n", "test1_id": 2799, "test2_input": "She hands the papers to Harpo over Groucho's shoulder as she dances with him... Groucho rushes to Harpo and they do a twirl together.  Harpo hands the paper to Chico over Groucho's shoulder.  Groucho rushes at Chico and twirls with him - Chico in trying to pass the papers to Vera drops them on the floor.  They all make a dive for them.  Groucho gets the papers and dashes with them to the lower box just as Mrs. Teasdale enters same. \nThe following is a close shot of Groucho and Mrs. Teasdale. The latter standing on stage right by the box. \nGROUCHO (Handing paper to Mrs. Teasdale) Here -- put these plans where no one will ever find them - sleep on them. \nCUT TO - Dressing room just a Vera, Chico and Harpo enter. \nVERA (Apologetically) I'm sorry boys -- I did my best -- it's all my fault. \nCHICO It's not-a your fault.  It's-a his fault -- (Indicating Harpo; then to Harpo accusingly) I fix it for you to getta the plans -- you getta the plans -- then you losa- a the plans -- now we no gotta the plans of war... \nHarpo lifts up his shirt and tattooed upon him is the reproduction of the war plans... \nFADE OUT \nEND OF SEQUENCE \"F\" \nSEQUENCE \"G\" \nFADE IN - Mrs. Teasdale's living room.  Night.  Subdued light. We begin with an EXTREME CLOSE CLOSE SHOT of a hand depositing the plans of war in a vault.  This vault is about the height of a man, the door flush with wall.  The CAMERA TRUCKS back and discloses that the one depositing the papers is Mrs. Teasdale -- she is in negligee.  She closes the vault door, pulls a cord, closing a pair of drapes which hide the vault. The CAMERA PANS to the balcony above where Vera Trentino, also in negligee, is watching the action in the living room below.  She tiptoes quietly from the scene. \nDownstairs, Mrs. Teasdale turns out the center table light and moves toward the stairway. \nCUT TO Vera Trentino's bedroom.  Vera comes toward window, raises it quietly and waves a handkerchief, evidently signalling somebody below. \nCUT TO EXTERIOR of house.  Chico and Harpo are waving back to signify that they have caught the signal.  The boys try to raise the window which is located next to the main entrance, but it is locked and they can't budge it. \nCHICO (Peeved) It's all your fault. Now we gotta steal the plans again -- You had 'em on you... you take a bath... and now we no gotta plans of war. \nThey try the window again and find it hopeless \nCHICO (To Harpo) You wait here -- I'll let you in. \nChico walks right in through the door, closes it behind him and then appears at the window.  He raises it from the inside and Harpo climbs in through the window and joins Chico. \nCUT TO INSIDE.  They are walking cautiously across the room when they hear the following coming over scene -- \"Psst... Psst...\"  They stop and look around, trying to locate the source of the sound.  We CUT TO the balcony and see Vera Trentino, still dressed in her negligee.  Once more she tries to attract them. \nVERA Psst... \nThe boys look up and see her. \nVERA (In a half whisper - mysteriously) In the safe -- behind the drapes -- (Pointing in the direction of the safe) \nCHICO (Also in a half whisper) All right -- I'll meet you behind the drapes. \n", "test2_true": "Harpo hasn't taken his eyes off of Vera during all this, makes a sudden dash for her, as she turns to her room. \nChico stops him on the second or third step of the stairs. \nCHICO Come on, we gotta no time for that. \nChico goes over to the safe and draws the curtains, disclosing safe.  Harpo follows and takes from his back pocket a rather large electrical drill with a cord and plug attached to it. Chico takes the cord and plugs it into the wall socket. \nHarpo starts to drill the safe door, making a terrific noise -- the usual reaping whir-r-r of an electric drill.  Chico grabs his hand and stops him from drilling. \nCHICO Wait a minute...  we make too much noise...  Turn on the radio so they can't hear what we're doing. \nHarpo goes over to radio and turns it on... a dance tune comes over the air.  Harpo grabs Chico and whirls him around as if he were dancing with a dame... \nCHICO (Jerking himself away from Harpo) What's-a matter, you crazy... ? \nChico goes to radio and adjusts dial to another station... the following comes over the air... \nRADIO POLICE ANNOUNCER Calling car 125... car 125... go to vacant lot at Tenth and Elm... a woman walking around in her nightgown --- \nHarpo drops the drill and makes a wild dash for door obviously to go to the woman... Chico stops him. \nCHICO Come on, we gotta finish the job... \nRADIO POLICE ANNOUNCER Calling car 67-W... car 67-W... go to Mrs. Teasdale's residence... burglars are attempting to break in. \nChico rushes to phone... and dials...  This shot excludes Harpo. \nCHICO (Into phone -- after slight pause) Hello -- Police department... ? That fellow's  crazy...  we're in the house already... \nChico turns to listen to the next announcement - hanging onto receiver. \nRADIO ANNOUNCER The Teasdale residence is located at 232 Poloma Drive... \nCHICO (Into phone) You'll never find us, you gotta the wrong address...  we're at 235 Poloma Drive... not 232...  Look, it's a white house with a shingle roof -- shingle -- shingle -- (and sings to illustrate) Shingle bells, shingle bells, shingle all the way... (Stops singing) That's it, you got it... Hurry up, if no get-a here soon, we can't wait... \nHangs up... looks around for Harpo, who is not there... \nCHICO Hey, Skippy... (Puts his fingers to mouth and whistles.) \nCUT TO Vera's bedroom.  It is a CLOSE SHOT showing Vera in bed, shot from side of bed.  She is under the bedcovers desperately trying to keep them from being pulled off her... TRUCK back disclosing Harpo on the other end of the bedcovers, trying to pull them off her... for a moment following, a tug of war goes on, Harpo pulling the covers about a foot his way and Vera pulling them back...  The sound of Chico's second whistle coming over scene attracts Harpo, who lets go of the covers and runs out of the room. \nWe pick him up outside of the room on balcony.  Without hesitation he slides down the bannisters to join Chico who is waiting at foot of stairs. \n", "test2_id": 2800, "test3_input": "FADE IN - to a group of notables standing around a large table.  Among them are Mrs. Teasdale and Zeppo.  Groucho is the guest of honor, very gaily attired for the occasion. \nAs we FADE INTO this scene, they are singing - \nALL (Singing) Hail, hail, Freedonia...  Land of the brave and free! \nZEPPO My dad is much too great for his position without a question.

TEASDALE My dear friends, in time of peace we should forgive those who fought against us, and so, I have invited our former enemies. (Applause) \nCUT TO door, as it is being opened by two pages. \nTrentino and Vera enter.  They both stop and bow in acknowledgment of the applause coming over scene. \nAs they walk toward table and out of scene, Chico and Harpo enter.  The latter is carrying a carpet runner, rolled up under his arm. He flips the carpet runner away from him on the floor, holding onto one end.  It rolls out and Harpo strides majestically down its length toward the table with Chico following.  Harpo pauses, brings to light a cuspidor from under his coat, puts it on the carpet and spits into it, and continues on, following Chico, who is now ahead of him.  Harpo breaks into a run and he and Chico dash madly to the table.  They take seats on either side of Groucho and without hesitating, start to eat the food in front of them. The guests are standing.  Trentino and Vera arrive at their places and everyone sits down. \nHarpo reaches for a large service plate with a pretty picture on it, pushes his plate away, breaks the service plate with a knife... it breaks into little pieces like a jig-saw puzzle. He mixes the pieces up, and then starts to put them together again ... Groucho watches him... then helps him... \nGROUCHO (Stopping Harpo as he tries to fit a piece) No, no, this is the one... (Picking up a piece and placing it...) \nA waiter places a dish of tasty food in front of Groucho... he is just about to dig into it with his knife and fork when Harpo turns the table toward himself.  This brings Groucho's food to Harpo, and Chico's empty plate to Groucho... \nGROUCHO That was awfully good, I think I'll have a second helping...  waiter... \nSnapping his finger to waiter off scene.  The waiter immediately appears placing a second dish in front of Groucho. He starts to dig his knife and fork into it again when Chico turns the table toward himself... This brings his food to Chico... Harpo lifts his plate up and puts it down again when the table stops turning... this time Groucho has nothing in front of him... \nGROUCHO If I don't stop eating I'll get indigestion... \nA WOMAN GUEST (To the left of Chico... to Chico) Would you mind passing the salt? \nCHICO (Yelling to Harpo) Hey, she wants some salt... \nHarpo takes salt shaker from man to his right, places it in front of himself and gives the table a quick turn toward the woman next to Chico... \nGroucho is still without food.  He rises and looks about table... Sees a dish of food in front of Trentino, who is seated at opposite side of table...  Trentino is eating. \nGROUCHO (Yelling to Trentino) Ambassador, how's the food? \nAMBASSADOR TRENTINO (Looking up and turning in direction of Groucho) It's delicious, Your Excellency. \nGROUCHO That's all I wanted to know. \nHe gives the table a quick turn and Trentino's plate disappears as it spins around toward Groucho... \n", "test3_id": 2801}

Jeff marches back into the diner... 
INT. DINER - DAY 
Jeff goes to the Bartender. 
JEFF Excuse me, how far is the next town? 
BARTENDER About twenty miles. 
JEFF Look, if my wife comes in -- her name is Amy -- tell her I was here. Tell her to stay put till I get back, not to move. Would you do that, please? 
BARTENDER (shrugs, bored) Okay. 
Jeff regards the Bartender skeptically.    He takes one last look around, then heads out. 
EXT. BELLE'S - DAY 
Jeff marches briskly to his car and opens the door, forgetting to deactivate the alarm. The SIREN WAILS. Jeff fumbles for the remote and shuts if OFF. 
HIGH ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER 
The Cherokee pulls out of the parking lot, kicking up gravel. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHEROKEE - DAY 
The stereo is off, the windows rolled up.   Jeff drives, his jaw set tightly. 
The speedometer reads 88 mph. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - MINUTES LATER 
The Cherokee crests a rise... 
INT. CHEROKEE - DAY 
... and then across the desert plain, traveling on another road, he sees it... 
PETERBILT 
The 18-wheeler that picked up Amy.    Cruising leisurely. 
Jeff presses the accelerator... 
EXT. FORK IN ROAD - DAY 
The Cherokee turns sharply onto the other road. 
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - AERIAL VIEW - DAY 
The Cherokee speeds down the road, gaining on the Peterbilt. It comes up behind. 
INT. CHEROKEE - DAY 
Jeff HONKS his HORN, flashes his lights. 
JEFF C'mon, you fat-ass.    Pull over. 
Either the driver doesn't notice, or he's ignoring Jeff, but the truck does not slow down. 
Jeff shifts into the oncoming lane and pulls alongside the cab. He HONKS again and waves, gesturing for the truck to pull over. But the Peterbilt maintains its speed. 
Jeff cranes his neck to get a glimpse of the driver... 
POV SHOT 
It's Red, alright. But he's wearing a different cap. FROM this ANGLE, we can't see into the passenger side of the cab. 
Red peers down at Jeff, puzzled.      Jeff shouts at him, waves: 
JEFF Pull over!    Pull over! 
Red suddenly notices something ahead in the road, BLARES his HORN. 
Jeff looks up, sees -- 
An RV camper approaching in the oncoming lane! 
HIGHWAY 
Jeff swerves onto the far shoulder as the RV whooshes past in the opposite direction, HORN BLARING. 
CHEROKEE 
Jeff is rattled, catching his breath.      He swings back onto the road. 
HIGHWAY 
Jeff slips in ahead of the Peterbilt, then starts weaving and braking, forcing the truck to slow. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Both vehicles pull to the side of the road and stop. Jeff leaps out of the Cherokee and runs over as Red climbs down from the empty cab.

JANINE (to Keenan) Don't sneer! 
KEENAN Oh, come on! I know the guy. We've done all kinds a' shit together: Hoops, hockey! 
JANINE Oh, and girls can't play sports?! 
KEENAN Oh, -whatever! Christ, Janine! Why the hell would he want to be a girl?! 
JANINE That's so hard to imagine?! 
KEENAN Uh, -YEAH! 
SYDNEY HEY! LISTEN UP! I know what I'm talking about. You see this? 
Sydney pulls out a SNAPSHOT, shows it to Janine. 
JANINE Who's he?     An Ex?   ...Oh, my God. 
SYDNEY Ex me. 
KEENAN You're one too? You're a Z? You're a guy?! 
SYDNEY Was.   I made a terrible mistake. 
She and Keenan keep staring at the photo... 
SYDNEY (CONT'D) And once you finally figure out who you are, it's a horrible thing not being yourself. That's why it's crucial we help Luke. 
Janine nods, grasping the significance. 
Keenan keeps looking from the photo to Sydney and back again. 
KEENAN You musta' worked out. 
EXT. CAMPUS - OUTSIDE DORM 
Luke sits, waiting on the steps of a campus dormitory. 
Janine approaches, grinning, carrying a box tied with a bow. Keenan trails behind, straddling his bike. 
LUKE What's this all about? 
Janine hands him the box. 
Keenan sneers, cringes. 
JANINE It's just a little something we thought you might want. 
Luke opens it, pulls out a BLUE DRESS. 
LUKE What the hell is this for? 
KEENAN (elated) I told her. (to Janine) I told ya'. What a stupid ass idea! 
JANINE Keen! Don't! We just want you to know, whatever you decide, it's all right with us. 
LUKE Decide?! WHAT?! No, it's not! Get this thing away from me! JUDAS PRIEST! 
Luke HURLS the box out to the curb.    Keenan gives him a thumbs up! 
KEENAN Sorry, man. Think she wishes everyone was female. 
JANINE What's that s'posed to mean? 
KEENAN Oh, Christ, Janine! It means he doesn't want to be girl!   Like he'd have to think about THAT! 
JANINE There happen to be millions of us out there that like being female! 
LUKE Well, bully for YOU! 
Janine walks over to pick up the box.

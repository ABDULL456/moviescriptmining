{"train": "RUST AND BONE \nWritten by \nJacques Audiard & Thomas Bidegain \nBased on Craig Davidson's short story collection \n16TH August 2011 \n1. THE CHILD Gradually more and more visible in the darkness, the face of a child, Sam. He is 6 years old, blond, pale and miserably thin. As we move in on his eyes, we see his lids quickly contracting. Under his eyelids: vestiges of the day's lights and shadows, of the day's noise. \n2. EXT. - NORTHWEST LANDSCAPES. DAY \nA grim region where the sky hangs low and the wind can knock a man off his feet. On the side of the highway, a large, muscular man with spiked blond hair: Ali Van Versh, 25. He has a big bag in one hand and a cell phone in the other. He talks on the phone as he continues walking: \nALI It's me. It's Ali... I left. I took the kid with me. She can't take care of him anymore. I got into a fight with the guy she's with. I don't know where to go. What do I do with the kid? I can't talk. I don't have any more credit... Call me back! He hangs up quickly and turns to Sam. \nALI Move it! His phone rings. He immediately answers. \nALI Yeah! Where is it? Shit! It's so far! How do I get there? I don't know. Today or tomorrow. Yeah... Ali lifts Sam onto his shoulders with one arm. Sam is tiny, he looks like a squirrel on his father's back. \n3. INT. TRAIN.DAY \nThere is a map of the French rail system near the toilets in a regional train. While Sam pees, Ali examines it. He follows the lines to plot out their trip. He arrives where France ends, at the Mediterranean. Sam comes out of the bathroom, straightening his pants. \nSAM I'm thirsty. \nALI We don't have any money. \nSAM I'm thirsty! \n4. INT. TGV. DAY \nA different speed, different countryside. Ali notices a half-empty bottle of Evian water left on a tray. He takes it. He searches through the garbage under other empty seats. Ali and Sam eat leftover sandwiches and fruit, and finish off abandoned bottles of water. \n5. INT. TGV. DAY \nAnother TGV. Rain evaporates off the windows. Ali has fallen asleep. He's too big for his seat. Sam watches the landscape go by and bangs his feet against his seat. Ali opens one eye. \nALI Stop it. Sam's Mickey Mouse sandals pause, then go back to their banging. \nALI I said to stop it. The sandals freeze. Cut. \n6. THE CHILD All of a sudden, Sam is asleep, his eyelids blinking quickly. \n7. EXT. CANNES STREET. DAY \nAli's face is turned toward the orange heat of an afternoon sun. Ali and Sam look at the sea, the beaches and hotels. It's hot and beautiful. They walk by tanned people in shorts, short skirts, sandals... In their shapeless grey track pants, they look like hoboes. Ali drags his sport bag with one hand and Sam with the other. Ali is on the phone: \nALI I don't know. A big street that started at the station. Yeah, by the beach. Behind? We just came from there! Ali pulls Sam away from one of the stairways that lead to the beach... \nSAM I'm tired. \nALI So am I. He's coming to pick us up. Come on! Sam is extenuated. Ali has to heave him up onto a shoulder. \n8. EXT. CANNES STREET. DAY \nA four-lane avenue near the outskirts of town. Ali is walking on the shoulder of the road, with Sam piggy- back. A horn beeps. A refrigerated truck, blinking to get to the side of the road. The window rolls down to reveal a moustache and a cap: Richard. \n12. EXT. GARDEN. EVENING \nEvening is falling. At the back of the garden are a home- made pen and doghouse. Four puppies come running. Sam touches them through the chicken wire. \nANNA You want to pet them? She lifts Sam up over the wire mesh. \nANNA Careful. Don't step on their tiny paws. They're just babies. Anna shows him how to feed puppies, then stands back up. \nANNA (to Ali) The breeder's picking them up next month. Brings in some money. Otherwise, Richard and I were thinking 300 a month for you and the kid... That okay? \nALI Yeah. \nANNA \"Yeah\" what? Is that too much? \nALI It's not too much, but I don't have it. I had to pay for the train... \nANNA So what are you going to do? \nALI I don't know. Find a job. Whatever. \nANNA Yeah, whatever... You think there's any work around here? You think there's any more here than there? Where has that ever been the case? When you told me you were coming down, \nI said we couldn't afford houseguests! \nALI What should I have done with the kid? Where should I have gone? \nANNA I have no idea, but if you stay here you have to pay your share, or else go somewhere else. As far as we're concerned, it's easy: we can't! How long were you thinking of staying? \nALI I don't know. She makes a tired gesture and goes back toward the house, calling Richard on the way. Ali hears Sam in the kennel, giggling in delight. He looks around: the seedy garden, a metal shed leaning to one side, what's left of an engine, an old, orange Special 50 moped, plastic junk, etc. Overhead, a plane descends on Nice, its landing lights shining. \n13. INT. BASEMENT. NIGHT \nIn the cluttered basement, Sam is rolled up in a sleeping bag arranged on a pallet and watches his father repair the antique Special 50 moped by the light of a flashlight. \n14. INT. ELECTRONIC GOODS SHOP. DAY \nAli wanders through an electronic goods shop, pretending to be interested in cameras. Through the shop window, he can see Sam waiting outside in the sun. \n15. EXT. ANTIBES STREETS. DAY \nSuddenly, Sam sees his father run out of the shop, trying to shake a security guard hot on his tail. Sam watches them disappear into a tiny lane. Sam looks around a bit frightened. \nFarther off, in a busy shopping district\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Ali forces his way through hordes of tourists. The security guard grabs him by the hood and forces him up against a wall. They are both dripping with sweat and out of breath. \nSECURITY GUARD Unzip your jacket! Empty your pockets! Ali keeps his cool. \nALI Unzip it yourself! Ali struggles free and smiles at the guy invitingly. The guard tries to punch him. Ali dodges: The guard hesitates a moment, until Ali lets fly a right hook. The guard stumbles. A kick in the face sends him flying into a stall. Ali lifts his arms in victory for the benefit of the few, stunned passersby. He kisses his own biceps, does three steps of a moonwalk and saunters off. \n16. EXT. ANTIBES STREETS. DAY \nSam is walking along the street by the beach amid the terraces and ice-cream stores, looking for his father. Then he sees the moped at the far side of the parking lot where they had left it chained up. He walks toward it. A voice calls out. \nALI Hey! Here I am! Ali crosses the street and kneels down in front of Sam who is sniffling, tears in his eyes. \nALI No need to cry. I wouldn't have left you all alone. Ali unlocks the moped. \n17. EXT. ALLEYWAY. DAY \nIn a small side street, Sam watches Ali sell a camera for a few 20 Euro notes. \nSTEPHANIE (embarrassed) Someone's up there. \nALI So what? \nSTEPHANIE Wait here. I'll be right back. She takes a few steps, fumbling for her keys. She hesitates, then looks back. \nSTEPHANIE Okay, come on up. \n24. INT. SIMON & STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT. NIGHT \nThey enter the apartment. The light is on. Simon comes out of the bedroom in his boxer shorts and a T-shirt. He's thirty, blond, and there is something commanding about his look that could be thought to resemble Stephanie's. He discovers Ali and the blood stains on Stephanie's T- \nSHIRT: \nSIMON What the hell? What's going on? \nSTEPHANIE Nothing. A fight... \nSIMON Are you okay? \nSTEPHANIE Yeah, I'm fine. \nSIMON (pointing to Ali) Who's he? \nSTEPHANIE The bouncer from the Fever. He drove me home. \nALI (introducing himself)... Ali. \nSIMON The Fever? What the hell were you doing there? Ali opens the refrigerator. \nSIMON What are you looking for? \nALI Ice cubes. \nSTEPHANIE He hurt his hand... Simon pulls Stephanie into the bedroom. Ice cubes in a Plexiglas salad bowl. Ali's hand in the bowl. He looks around. There are photos on the wall: Stephanie surfing on the back of a killer whale, Stephanie posing with a group of young people in diving suits in front of the Marineland logo, Stephanie rising out of the water on Niska's rostrum, etc. From the nearby bedroom, he hears snatches of Simon's \nREPROACHES: \nSIMON (OFF) If you decide to go out, call me. That's all! Who were you with there? \nSTEPHANIE (OFF) Philippe and Christine. \nSIMON (OFF) I thought you went out to dinner. \nSTEPHANIE (OFF) We decided to go out for a drink after. \nSIMON (OFF) You get my text messages? Why didn't you answer me? Stephanie comes back into the kitchen. She has changed her T-shirt. She seems tense. \nSTEPHANIE Feeling better? \nALI Is that you in the picture with the orcas? \nSTEPHANIE Not orcas. Just one orca. Her name is Niska. \nALI Is that your job? \nSTEPHANIE Yep... Ali nods vaguely admiringly. \nALI Fuck... I didn't think that... \nGILLES They were a part of you. When a man dies, he gets buried. There's a ceremony, a prayer... Now a piece of you ended up in a hospital trashcan without a prayer, without any time for meditation. A beat. She is dumbstruck. She cannot believe what she's hearing. In the backseat, Raphael exhales some smoke into Julia's open mouth. GILLES (cont'd) You have to think about it symbolically... \nSTEPHANIE Yeah, it's really symbolic... \nGILLES I know where my arm is. We buried it under a nice oak tree behind my house in the scrubland. My wife and kids came and we sang... Stephanie has a fit of the giggles. \nGILLES (a bit vexed) You think I'm kidding? \nSTEPHANIE No, it's the grass. I'll stop... She laughs so hard she cries. \nRAPHAEL Shit, it's a laugh riot up there. (to Gilles) Can you take us home? She looks back and, between the seats, notices the girl toying with Raphael's fly. \nGILLES I'm too beat. I'll take a nap, then go. (to Stephanie) How are you getting home? \n40. EXT/INT. HYPERBRICO. NIGHT \nA HyperBrico DIY store in an industrial zone in Cannes. Its windows shine in the night like an aquarium. \n41. INT. HYPERBRICO. NIGHT \nAli and Kadhi, a huge guard accompanied by a dog, make their rounds. They open doors with a magnetic key, each time recording their passage on electronic terminals. A bit before midnight, someone knocks at the main entrance. Ali goes to look. It's a guy in a leather jacket and baseball cap, with a backpack and a shoulder bag. \nALI What do you want? \nMARTIAL To come in. The guy takes out a card and presses it against the glass door: it's the business card of ALTA SECU, the security agency. \nALI Hey, Kadhi, come here! Kadhi comes over and looks at the guy. \nKADHI Okay, okay... Are you Martial? \nMARTIAL Yeah. \nKADHI Give me your keys. \nALI Who's he? \nKADHI It's fine. The boss told me he was coming. He works for the company. Ali hands him the bunch of keys. \n42. INT. HYPERBRICO - AISLES. NIGHT \nAli goes down an aisle looking for something and finally finds what he was looking for: a folding ladder. \n43. INT. HYPERBRICO - STOCK ROOM. NIGHT \nMartial has spread out his material in a stock room at the back of the store at the end of a corridor formed by palettes: precision tools, drills, electronic mini-cameras still in their wrapping, cases equipped with antennae, packs of batteries... A small radio is playing a night program on Radio Monte Carlo. Equipped with a small headlamp, Martial carefully cuts a hole in a cardboard box with his Leatherman scissors. He conceals a tiny camera inside. \nAli arrives with the ladder over his shoulder. \nALI Will this do? \nMARTIAL Perfect. Put it down there. Martial climbs the ladder to place the box high on a shelf. \nMARTIAL Imagine you're the manager of a big store like this and the union reps have been busting your balls. What do you do? \nALI Fire them. \nMARTIAL You think that's how it works? What do you do before you fire them? He checks to make sure the lens is aligned with the hole, then checks the screen and reception on a small pocket monitor. \nMARTIAL Well, beforehand you try to see how long they spend in the restroom, if they take extra-long coffee breaks, smoke on the premises, steal from the stockroom, rip customers off with the sales receipts... When you know all that, you put the pressure on them and you fire the ones who don't leave. Can you give me a stroll down the aisle? \nThe door opens automatically. He is surprised. He hears a tired voice from inside. \nSTEPHANIE (OFF) Come in. She is waiting in her wheelchair, holding the remote control. She activates it and the door closes behind Ali. Her hair is mid-length, her face has thickened and there are bags under her eyes. She is wearing a baggy Nike T- shirt with burn marks here and there and a pajama bottom whose legs hang limp. \nSTEPHANIE Have you been waiting long? \nALI No... I just got here. \nSTEPHANIE Was that you who rang before? She looks exhausted but feverish. \nALI No. \nSTEPHANIE Come in. Sit down. He sits down on a small couch. \nSTEPHANIE Want something to drink? A coffee? \nALI Yes. \nSTEPHANIE I only have instant. \nALI That's fine. It takes two tries to activate the wheels on her wheelchair. \nALI Need any help? She answers with a growl, as much for him as for her wheelchair, then goes into the kitchen. He sees her pajama legs flap like rags, he hears the noise of the tap. \nALI Have you been living here long? \nSTEPHANIE I don't know... Three or four months. \nALI (looking around)... It's nice. She comes back. \nALI Are you alone? You got no one to help you? \nSTEPHANIE Help me what? Walk? \nALI No, for the cleaning and everything... \nSTEPHANIE Yeah there are people. They come and go. Hold on. She manages to navigate from the living room into her bedroom. He stays in the living room. He hears a kettle whistle in the kitchen. He goes into the kitchen and pours water into the glass/mug. He finds her hunched over in her \nwheelchair. She is nodding off, high on her medication. \nALI Hey, are you okay? \nSTEPHANIE I'm fine. He opens the window. \nSTEPHANIE Does it stink here? \nALI Yeah, a little. \nSTEPHANIE It's me. He opens the curtains and looks outside. It is getting hot out. The automatic sprinklers have gone on. \nALI Let's go out. (No answer) Hey, you hear me? \nSTEPHANIE Yes. \nALI Let's go out. \nSTEPHANIE No. \nALI Get dressed. \nSTEPHANIE Don't let me go! Not right away... Do it gently. She feels unsure of herself. He lets go of her gradually. She starts to sink, then crawls forward, with power and grace. She stops but has to paddle like a dog to tread water. He joins her. She grabs onto him. \nALI So? \nSTEPHANIE I can't stop. If I do, I sink. Wait... She gesticulates... \nSTEPHANIE This is bothering me! She takes off her T-shirt and hands it to him. Her breasts press against Ali's chest. \nSTEPHANIE Okay, you can let go. She lets herself go and crawls like a pro. He stays put, holding her t-shirt. Twenty-five meters later, her head emerges. He hears a burst of laughter. Half asleep in a deck chair, he looks up from time to time to see how she's doing. She calls out to him. She is sitting in the water. She motions for him to come and get her. He helps her out and takes her into his arms. She hangs on to him, still out of breath. \nALI You swim like a real pro!... She shuts her eyes. \nSTEPHANIE Fuck that's good! The beach is crowded now. Ali carries her back to the deck chairs. Some bathers watch them go by, others look away. They are stretched out in their chairs. She has wrapped her lower body in a beach towel. They sunbathe. \nSTEPHANIE Thanks. \nALI Huh? \nSTEPHANIE Thanks. \nShe rolls onto her back. He sees her breasts pointed heavenward. \n51. INT. GYM. DAY \nA decrepit, simple, functional, but reasonably clean workout room. Guys of every color work the punching bags, lift weights, do chin-ups... From the gym next door, we hear the booming music of an aerobics class. In a small ring at floor level, Ali and Foued, loaded down with protective gear, pound each other. Each of their blows lands right on target. They repeat the same series of moves several times at varying speeds. \n52. INT. GYM - CORRIDOR. DAY \nAli and Foued are dripping wet. They have towels around their necks. They fill their small plastic bottles at a faucet in the workout room. Through a large window in the corridor, Ali watches the aerobic class going on in the gym: legs and feet moving in rhythm, red faces, sweaty underarms, butts, boobs and the braid of the instructor, who uses it to beat the measure, as she swings it from one shoulder to the other. \nFOUED I have to get back. I need to train. Ali nods, without actually looking at him. \n53. EXT. GYM - STREET. DAY \nOutside, Ali has unwrapped the sandwich his sister had prepared for him. A bit farther off, the aerobics instructor is smoking in the sun. She has a short, buff body. She smokes her cigarette like someone who counts them out sparingly. They remain like that a while, he chewing ands she smoking. \nCUT TO \n54. INT. GYM - EQUIPMENT ROOM. DAY \nA cell phone vibrates. Through a narrow transom, a ray of sun slices through the dark equipment room. They haven't bothered undressing. Ali and the aerobics instructor are making love on a pile of workout mats. Ali's cell phone continues to vibrate, goes silent, vibrates again. He answers. We hear a crackling voice. \nALI I'm still at the gym. I'm leaving... I said I'm leaving! He hangs up. They continue. \n55. EXT. NUSERY SCHOOL - SCHOOLYARD. DAY \nSam is playing alone, perched up on monkey bars in the schoolyard. Through a wide window, he sees his father racing down a corridor that runs alongside the schoolyard. The principal is waiting for him at the door. Ali spurts out some quick apologies. Sam slowly slides off the structure. We hear the noise of his hands skidding on metal. \n56. EXT ANTIBES EVENING The moped wheezes and sputters. Ali and Sam are heading back home along the beach. Ali is so big, the moped looks like a kid's bike. Behind him on the luggage rack, he can feel Sam leaning into him. Sam's hand rummages in his coat pocket for a box of Choco-BN cookies. Ali takes one too. To their left, a train noisily speeds by. \n57. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT. DAY \nLouise has a set of keys. She enters Stephanie's apartment with the mail. \nLOUISE Steph! Made up and well-groomed, she looks older than she actually is. Stephanie answers from the bathroom. \nSTEPHANIE (OFF) I'm in here! Louise puts the mail on the living room table and enters the bedroom. Stephanie wheels herself out of the bathroom, her hair wet and her body wrapped in a towel. \nLOUISE Shit, you're not ready! The appointment is in a half hour! \nIn close up on the screen of a small DVD player: amateur images of two bare-chested guys fighting in the garden of a suburban house. It looks like a wild boxing match, free- for-all vale tudo in which anything goes. In the Bricorama security room, Ali, Kadhi and Martial, excited, are bent over the screen. A few blows to the face have one of the combatants KO on the lawn. \nKADHI Look at the next one! Watch how he whacks him. A change of scene on the small screen: a courtyard between two tower blocks, with new combatants, but with the same amateur images and the same violence. \nKADHI (pointing to the screen)... I know him. I fought him twice in Nationals. He's not bad. He was at the boxing club in Marseille. Martial watches Ali, fascinated by the images, as if he were sizing him up. \n62. INT. PROJECTS. DAY \nAn apartment in a Golfe Juan housing project. After-dinner time. Kids are playing, women doing the dishes. On the living room couch, under a tapestry of a lion hunt in Technicolor, Martial blows on his glass of tea. His \ncousin is sitting across from him. Ali is on a stool at the end of the table. \nMARTIAL He says he's done Thai boxing. He can fight. He's enormous. He's not afraid of taking punches, and he's white. \nCOUSIN I see. The cousin turns to Ali. He takes his time sizing him up. \nCOUSIN Is that true? You like to fight? \nALI Yeah. \nCOUSIN Okay, so I organize the fights. I pick the fighters. I see if the money's there. I ref. I collect the dough... I take a third of the bets. The rest goes to the winner... \nMARTIAL A third of how much? \nCOUSIN We don't fight for less than 800. Ali does the division in his head. \nMARTIAL So? Ali hesitates. \nALI (to Martial) There's something I don't get: how much do you take? \nMARTIAL I don't know. You tell me. How much do you need? I'll take 20% of what you win. How's that? \nALI And how much does your cousin give you? \nMARTIAL Oh, I introduced you to him, didn't I? How's that? \nALI Okay. The cousin stands up. They all shake on it. \n63. INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY \nAli is in a corner of the living room, sitting in front of Anna's old PC and watching some fight videos he's found. Anna rushes into the room. \nANNA Keep Sam with you for 5 minutes! She hurries to find some papers in the drawer of a commode. Ali hasn't budged. \nANNA Oh! Hear me? I don't want your son in the garden. \nALI Yeah, I heard. He gets up and goes to get Sam who is playing behind the house. Anna finds her papers and leaves in another direction. \nALI Sam! Come here! I want to show you some stuff! He lifts Sam up with one arm and goes back to the computer. \nALI Look how they fight... He clicks on an image and the fight continues... the audience's noise as well. Sam watches, intrigued. Ali \ncommentates, pointing to guys onscreen. \nALI Look at him, in red. See how strong he is? \nSAM Is he the good guy? \nALI No, he's the bad guy. Look how he tries to grab his legs. Wait. His phone vibrates. He takes it from his pocket. It's Martial. He answers. \nSTEPHANIE And you're not scared? \nALI Of what? \nSTEPHANIE How much do they pay you for this? \nALI I don't know. About 500, 1000 maybe. \nSTEPHANIE You're doing that for 500 euros? \nALI Um, yeah. \nSTEPHANIE You're going to get whacked on the face and risk your health for 500 euros? \nALI Risk my health? What are you talking about? Why are you getting so worked up? \nSTEPHANIE I'll give you the 500! Cancel it and I'll give it to you tomorrow. \nALI You can give it to me if you have too much money, but I said I was doing it and I am. That's all. \nSTEPHANIE If it's not for money, why then? \nALI I didn't say it's not for the money! \nSTEPHANIE Why are you doing it? \nALI Oh, stop driving me crazy! I'm doing it to fight. For fun. Why did you clown around on your fish? For the fun of it, right? She grins. \nSTEPHANIE Yeah and look how I ended up. \nALI Spare me. You turn on the waterworks when you feel like it. \nShe dries her eyes. He begins to pack things up. \nSTEPHANIE Your fight, if you do it... \nALI Mm? \nSTEPHANIE You think I can come along? \n67. EXT/INT. MARTIAL'S MERCEDES. DAY \nA narrow road. Down below, a town. The Mercedes Vito with the tinted windows lifts a cloud of dust. Stephanie is in the back seat and has to hold on to the overhead strap to avoid hurting herself. At the end of the road is a gate guarded by two huge homies. They signal Martial to over. He rolls down his window and the two homies peer inside. They see Ali and Stephanie in the back. \nHOMEBOY 1 Who's she? \nMARTIAL His girlfriend. Surprised, Stephanie looks at Ali, watching for his reaction. He looks elsewhere. The gate opens. Martial drives in. \n68. EXT / INT. MARTIAL'S MERCEDES. DAY \nAli and Stephanie are alone in the car. Through the tinted windows, they can see a concrete yard with boats dry-docked around it and buildings with satellite dishes studding every balcony. Some men are over in one corner, discussing: Martial, his cousin and some other mean looking guys. In the shade, a bit to one side and surrounded by his fans, is a bare-chested, muscle-bound North African. He warms up, \nwagging his head from left to right. \nALI (under his breath) Motherfucker's acting like he's on Canal Plus. \nSTEPHANIE Who are the other guys? \nALI I don't know. Guys with money. Dealers. A beat. \nSTEPHANIE What do you want to know? If I knew him before the accident? Martial looks back. \nMARTIAL What? \nSTEPHANIE You find it weird that we're together? You wonder what he's doing with me? \nMARTIAL No, since you know him, I just wanted to know if you've seen him like that before? \nSTEPHANIE No. Martial finishes counting the bills. \nMARTIAL He freaks me out. He takes his share and hands Stephanie the envelope. \nMARTIAL 1200 for him. She looks at the envelope without taking it. \nSTEPHANIE Why are you giving me that? \nMARTIAL It's for Ali. \nSTEPHANIE Exactly. So why give it to me? He looks at her, suddenly surprised. \nMARTIAL Hey, you make it complicated. Either you take it or you don't. And either I talk or I keep my mouth shut. He tosses the envelope at her. She looks away. Ali finally gets back into the car with a big box. It's a toy: a green John Deere tractor with all the accessories. \nALI For my kid. \nSTEPHANIE You have a kid? \nALI Yep. \n74. EXT. BEACH - ROAD. DAY \nThe afternoon sun has the entire coast sparkling. Ali is on his moped, with the box between his knees, driving up the coastal road. He looks splendid, wearing new clothes. He finally sees what he was looking for: a group on the beach, Anna, Richard and their neighbors, having a picnic. \nCUT TO: \n75. EXT. BEACH. DAY \nCU Ali and Anna are off to one side, talking. \nANNA You see what you're like with him? You're not around and when you are, you scream at him. Damn, you hit him! Why did you take him along if you act like that? You should have left him. \nALI Cut the shit. He's not dead. I didn't do it on purpose. I'm sorry about it. Anna avoids his glance. He rummages in his pocket, pulls out the envelope of money and hands it to her. \nALI Here. \nANNA What's that? \nALI Money. What I owe you plus the next few \nmonths. You can count it. She looks at the bills. \nANNA Where did you get this? (pointing to his new clothes) Same place? \nALI I won a fight. \nANNA A fight? What kind of fight? Is that the only job you could find? Is that why you have marks on your face? \nALI Hey, will you take the money or not? Why are you looking at me that way? \nANNA Nothing. He leaves her with the envelope and trots over to the rest of the group. They are packing away ice chests and folding things up. Sam and his little friends are playing in the sand with the John Deere tractor. Sam has a bandage on his forehead. Ali sits down in the sand next to him. \nMARTIAL I'll have my company pay you and I'll bill them what you cost me. They'll keep paying you but now you'll work directly for me. You won't have to spend your nights there. There is some movement on the screen. He interrupts himself. Gray silhouettes cross the screen, open a door and disappear before coming back to cross the screen once again. \nALI Where's that? \nMARTIAL At the Mousquetaires. Martial rewinds and zooms in on some faces. \nMARTIAL I'll make a copy and you'll take it to the \nowner. Ask for Steve at Security. He'll tell you what to do. \n80. INT. RICHARD'S TRUCK. DAY \nSam is on Richard's lap, \u00e2\u0080\u0098driving' the truck. He is in seventh heaven. In front of them, a man is running down the shoulder of the road. \nRICHARD Look who it is! Go on, honk! \n81. EXT. ROAD. DAY \nThe horn beeps. Out of breath, in a sweat, Ali looks back and sees Richard and Sam in the truck. They slow down and pull up to him. Richard lowers his window. \nRICHARD We're going to school. Want to come along? Ali shakes his head and continues jogging. The truck disappears. \n82. INT. NEW GYM. DAY \nThis new gym is large, clean and light. In one corner there is a genuine ring, and on the other side, a piece of tatami. Ali is working out with Joao, a Brazilian in a kimono. They try out some foot-fist series. On the mat, Ali shadows and deconstructs Joao's gestures. \n83. EXT. ANTIBES. STREET. DAY \nA street near the beach. The weekend is beginning. The streets are crowded. Ali is on the phone. \nALI Where are you? I can't see you. Where? He looks every which way until he sees her, a few feet away. She is standing upright, in a light pair of pants, with her canes hidden behind her back. It takes some time to register. She smiles at him. \nALI That's fucking amazing! I was looking for a wheelchair... \nSTEPHANIE Stop looking. No more wheelchairs! \nALI Since when? \nSTEPHANIE Two days. \nALI You could have told me! \nSTEPHANIE Why? Is it a problem? \nALI No, I don't know. You're like before. \nSTEPHANIE Well, not exactly. \nALI Go on, let's see. She takes a few steps forward, leaning on her canes. He whistles in admiration. \nSTEPHANIE I need to get my balance but supposedly that doesn't take long. \nALI It must be like walking on stilts... \nSTEPHANIE I don't know. I've never walked on stilts before. \nALI You look taller. Does it hurt? \nSTEPHANIE A little, but it feels good too. \nSTEPHANIE Okay, let's change the subject... She begins piling up plates and silverware. \nALI You want to fuck? She is thrown for a loop. \nSTEPHANIE Huh? \nALI You want to know if it still works, so let's fuck and that way you'll know. He looks at her, simply, naturally. She has a nervous laugh. \nSTEPHANIE Just like that? \nALI Um, yeah. Give me that. He takes the plates, gets up and puts them in the dishwasher. \nSTEPHANIE I... I don't know if I can like that... \nALI Whatever you want... You tell me... She hesitates. \nSTEPHANIE Wait. She wheels herself away from the table and into the bedroom. He remains alone, quickly cleaning the table. \nALI What do I do? \nSTEPHANIE (OFF) Wait! He waits. Then: \nSTEPHANIE (OFF) Come here. \n85. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM. DAY \nHe enters the room. The shutters are closed. She is in bed, under the covers. She watches him sit down on the bed, undo \nhis pants and turn toward her. \nALI Okay? Ready? Unsure of herself, she pulls a face. \nSTEPHANIE Let's try. He slips under the covers, spontaneously tries to kiss her, but she pushes him away gently. \nSTEPHANIE (a little nervous) Do you mind if we don't kiss? \nALI No. Your breasts... can I? \nSTEPHANIE Yes. He licks her breasts, then lies on top of her, covering her. She tries to wriggle herself free. \nSTEPHANIE You're crushing me! \nALI Maybe you should stop talking now... \nSTEPHANIE Okay, I'll stop. His hands caress her, they grab onto what remains of her thighs. He enters her. She is about to scream, but lets herself go. She grabs hold of him. \nSTEPHANIE Gently! \n86. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN. DAY \nAli opens the fridge. He is dressed again. Stephanie appears in a robe, sitting in her wheelchair. We can tell she feels too shy to look at him. \nALI Are you okay? How was it? She blushes. \nALI Is it still working? \nSTEPHANIE Um, yes... no... I don't really know. It's different... It's hard to tell after just one try... \nALI Yeah but I don't have time right now. I have to go! \nSTEPHANIE If he's up for it. If he's free. If he is, we fuck. \nLOUISE Is that all? \nSTEPHANIE Yes, that's all. What else do you want? \nLOUISE I don't know. Is that enough? \nSTEPHANIE For me it is. \nLOUISE What does he do? Stephanie hesitates a moment, as if worried about how Louise will react. \nSTEPHANIE He fights. \nLOUISE What kind? MMA? \nSTEPHANIE No. Illicit fights in the projects. Louise reacts. \nSTEPHANIE Whatever I say, you make a face. \nLOUISE Just give me a second to react... Are you in love? She hesitates. \nSTEPHANIE He does me good. \n93. EXT. PARKING LOT. MARINELAND. DAY \nThe group of trainers has accompanied Stephanie to a taxi. \n94. INT. TAXI/PARKING LOT - MARINELAND. DAY \nStephanie waves good-bye. They return her wave. The taxi drives away. The group scatters. \nCUT TO: \n95. INT. BASEMENT. DAY \nA dark cellar. We hear Ali and Stephanie labor and sigh. A door suddenly opens above and we hear voices. \nALI Shit! \nSTEPHANIE Who is it? He looks for his clothes... \n96. EXT. GARDEN. DAY \n... then goes to the garden where he startles Anna: \nANNA I didn't know you were here. You scared me. What were you up to? \nALI I was talking? \nANNA You're not alone? \nALI I'm with a friend. \nANNA You bring girls back to my place now? \nALI She's a friend, I said. Just then, the basement door opens and Stephanie appears on her crutches. Anna is dismayed. Ali motions to Stephanie: \nALI (to Stephanie) Let me introduce you to my sister! (to Anna) This is Stephanie. You know the girl from Marineland. Stephanie offers her hand to Anna who takes it, then realizing what she's doing, puts the other to her mouth: \nHIM OFF\u00c2\u0080\u00a6 \n101. INT. MARTIAL'S CAR. DAY \nThe car is driving back into town. Martial is driving. The windows are open. Ali holds a bag of ice against his cheek bone, while Stephanie applies her Band-Aids to a cut over his eyebrows. They are talking, but we can not hear what they say. All we hear is the noise of the wind against the open windows. Ali suddenly breaks out laughing. Martial does too in the rear view mirror. Stephanie follows suit\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \n102. INT. MOUSQUETAIRES. DAY \nMuzak. Ali and Martial follow the head of security into the store. Some of the personnel are near the cash registers, silent, hostile and immobile. The morning customers wonder what's happening. The head of security elbows his way through. \nHEAD OF SECURITY Let them through, please! The personnel reluctantly make way. \n103. INT. MOUSQUETAIRES - STOCKROOM. DAY \nRed graffiti on the wall: \"A SPYING BOSS IS A CRIMINAL \nBOSS!\" \nAli recognizes the place with the palettes up to the ceiling. In the back, he also recognizes the manager, protected by two guards and being harangued by union representatives. \nMARTIAL (to Ali, pointing to the manager) Go get the equipment. I need to see him. Ali obeys. \nUNION REP Don't bother. We're the ones who will call the police. The police and the press. That way they'll know you spy on your workers! The manager looks away, accompanied by his two guards. \nUNION REP At least have the courage to look at me when I talk to you! \nCUT TO: The cameras, the ripped out cables, the phony boxes have been piled up on the floor. It looks more like the crime squad has been at work. Ali opens a garbage bag and bends over to retrieve the equipment. \nWOMAN (OFF) What are you doing there? She's a young employee in the store uniform. \nALI (suspicious) Packing up. \nWOMAN Is it your stuff? \nALI No. He notices that she's taken out her cell phone to take a picture. \nALI Don't you take a picture! \nWOMAN You work for them? She continues to manipulate her phone. \nALI I said no picture! \nWOMAN Why shouldn't I? You film us! He straightens up menacingly. \nALI I'm going to slap you! A hand grabs his arm. It's Martial. \nMARTIAL Forget it. Let's get out of here! \nALI And the equipment? \nMARTIAL Forget about it. We're fucked here. The cops are going to question the managers and the managers will turn us in. They leave. \n104. INT. MARTIAL'S FORMULE 1 ROOM. NIGHT \nMartial's fingers slowly play with the hair on his chest. He is lying nude on the bed of his Formule 1 hotel room. He smokes and stares at the ceiling. His suitcases and bags are packed, all he has to do is close them. He hears knocks next door. He gets up with a sigh, pulls on his pants and opens the door. Stephanie is waiting in front of room 429. \nMARTIAL In here. Stephanie looks back, surprised. Martial motions her in. \nMARTIAL I have to go away for work. 3 or 4 months, I don't know yet... Since Ali wants to keep fighting, I thought maybe you tend to that while I'm not here... She is thunderstruck. \n107. EXT. FEVER RAY. NIGHT \nThe smoking area is located outside, and a bit farther off, the dope smoking area. Behind the smokers, we hear noise from the club. Cousin is puffing on a spliff. Stephanie watches, holding her champagne goblet. He offers it to her. She accepts and takes a drag. \nCOUSIN Can I talk to you? She nods \"yes\". \nCOUSIN There's something I'd like to know... The fish that ate your legs... She wasn't expecting that. \nSTEPHANIE Yes? \nCOUSIN Is it true it's still there? \nSTEPHANIE Yeah... where else would it be? \nCOUSIN They didn't shoot it? Or put it down, whatever? \nSTEPHANIE Why would they do that? \nCOUSIN I don't know... when a dog attacks you, they kill it. And the fish gets off. Don't you mind that the thing that ate your legs is living it up in its shitty fucking aquarium? \nSTEPHANIE No. And I don't want anything to happen to it. Now more than ever! He looks at her, incredulous, but with admiration. \nCOUSIN (imitating her) \"Now more than ever\". Listen to you! He takes another drag. \nCOUSIN (imitating her) Tututu-tu-tutu... They laugh. \nSTEPHANIE Do I sound like that? \nCOUSIN Tututu... \n108. INT. FEVER RAY. NIGHT \nWe are back inside. Ali is working on a girl a bit farther off on the dance floor. Stephanie follows Cousin through the noise and sticky heat. When she next looks at the dance floor, Ali is no longer there. Ali and the girl are on their way to the exit. Ali looks for a friendly face, meets Stephanie's glance and motions that he's leaving. She waves: \"Yeah, ok, I get it.\" Ali disappears with the girl. Stephanie is at the bar, drinking. She types an SMS into her cell phone: \"operational?\" She hesitates, then puts \naway her cell phone. She hadn't noticed a guy sitting next to her. She also failed to notice that he's been speaking to her for a while now. \nSTEPHANIE (loud) Huh? I can't hear you... \nGUY (loud) No problem. What are you drinking? \nSTEPHANIE (loud) Champagne? The guy orders. He is blond, lean and athletic-looking. He might be thought to resemble Simon. \nGUY What's your name? I'm Pierre. \nSTEPHANIE Hey there. I'm Marie. \nGUY Come here often? Stephanie is on automatic pilot. When she turns to the room, she feels the blond guy's eyes locked onto her. She can pretty much tell what he's thinking about the breasts under her T-shirt. She answers his questions, she returns his smiles. When she finishes her glass and puts it down on the counter, he kisses her. She doesn't push him away immediately, like a frightened virgin, she takes the time to put a good face on it. \nSTEPHANIE No... No, please. I don't feel like it. Not tonight. I can't... The guy looks disappointed, then manages a \u00e2\u0080\u0098good loser's' smile. \nGUY Okay, no problem... \nSTEPHANIE It's best I go. Good night and thanks. \nHe sees her lean over to retrieve her canes and then hobble away. \nGUY Sorry. I couldn't know. Stephanie freezes. \nSTEPHANIE You couldn't know what? \nSTEPHANIE We'll continue... but not like animals. He smirks, with a flick of the chin. \nSTEPHANIE Cat got your tongue? Ali stirs his cup without answering. He feels her eyes on him. He smiles. \nALI I'm oper now. \nSTEPHANIE What? \nALI You made me oper. It's you! It's because it's all you're talking about! \nSTEPHANIE (softly) You are really a dog. He stands up. \nSTEPHANIE What are you doing? \nALI I'm getting out of here. \nSTEPHANIE Why? \nALI I'm fed up. \nSTEPHANIE You're bored? \nALI Yeah. \nSTEPHANIE What I'm saying bores you? \nALI Yeah. \nSTEPHANIE Are you acting like a jackass on purpose? \nALI Aren't you being an ass by putting words everywhere? He sits back down. She watches him eat his sandwiches. \nSTEPHANIE I'm the one who's leaving. She gets up. Ali finishes his coffee. \n110. INT. TATTOO PARLOR. DAY \nThe buzz of a small electric compressor. In extreme close up: the needle of a tattoo machine pricking skin. Ink flows, a cotton swab wipes... a tattoo slowly appears. Lying on a table, Stephanie is having what remains of her legs tattooed. \nCUT TO: \n111. EXT/INT. BANK. DAY \nStephanie is at a teller's window, withdrawing a rather large amount of cash. A machine counts out the bills, while the employee stuffs wads of them into an envelope. \n112. EXT/INT USED CAR DEALERSHIP. DAY Pennants flap in the wind, the pennants of a used car dealership. CU: car doors opening, automatic gearboxes, Stephanie's \"feet\" testing pedals, bucket seats, backseats, tinted windows opening and closing, etc. \n113. INT. PROJECTS - APARTMENT. DAY \nA painting of a lion hunt and, under it, Stephanie and Cousin on a couch, talking shop. Leaning over a computer and a cell phone, they go over potential adversaries. Some kids stick their heads in to see what Stephanie looks like. \n114. INT. NEW GYM. DAY \nFoued, wearing protective gear, spars with a black cruiserweight. The fight is close, the sound of flesh on flesh resounds. Outside the ring, Ali cheers Foued on. He notices on the other side of the ring a young thin, bearded guy in a Lacoste polo shirt buttoned up to his neck - Leonardini - who is following the fight with the eye of a pro. When Ali and Joao are later working out on their bit of tatami, Ali sees Foued sitting on a bench, with a towel around his neck and talking with Leonardini. \nFOUED He saw me at la Ciotat. We spoke a few times on the phone. When he has it in for you, he never lets up. Leonardini is well-known. \nHe was a club in Strasbourg with a training center. He's taking me on a trial basis for three months. If it works out, he'll make challenger in the nationals. \n115. INT. LOCKER ROOM - NEW GYM. DAY \nALI Shit... But what's the problem if I eat here? Anna stands up. \nANNA They had cameras in the storeroom... They filmed us when we took the expired food. They fired us. Ali's head spins. \nANNA You had your sister fired. How does it feel? How much did you get for that? You get paid per person or a flat rate? Nothing to say? I take you in, I take care of your son and you have nothing to say? \nALI I couldn't know... \nANNA You couldn't know? You couldn't know what? That you were screwing us out of jobs? That you were hurting people? Ali tries to find something to say, but his sister's hand delivers a resounding slap. He takes it like a man. A moment passes. Ali is red from the slap, red with shame\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 until he suddenly straightens up and knocks over the table. \nRICHARD Calm down. Calm down, I said! Ali looks back. He sees Richard's grim face at the other end of a hunting rifle. \nRICHARD Take your stuff and get out of here. We don't want to see you around here anymore. \nA sudden noise draws their attention: Sam is watching from the top of the stairs. \nANNA Go to your room. Go upstairs immediately. \n129. INT. ANNA'S HOUSE - BASEMENT. DAY \nAn SMS arrives from Stephanie: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlmost there. I miss you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ali is lying on his mattress. He puts down the phone. He hears Anna and Richard's voices upstairs. He sits up and begins to stuff things into a bag. A new message arrives: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm home. Oper?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ali hesitates, then turns off his phone and clicks his bag closed. \n130. INT. ANNA'S HOUSE - SAM'S ROOM. EVENING \nNight has fallen. Sam's nose is stuck to his bedroom window. He sees his aunt sitting at the plastic table in the garden downstairs with her face in her hands. A door slams. Sam rushes to the bathroom window. He sees his father stomp down the street, never once looking back. Sam remains glued to the window pane. Ali's silhouette moves through the halo of a streetlight before again disappearing into the dark. Sam watches him for as far as he can. Fade to black. \n131. INT/ EXT. BASEMENT. DAY \nIn the half-light of the basement, a rectangle of light has formed where the door opens onto the street. Stephanie looks over Ali's mess: his magazines, body building equipment, dirty T-shirts, track suits hanging over a trestle... Anna is standing against the light at the door and, a bit farther off, Sam is sitting on the stairs watching them. \nANNA In his message he said he was in Strasbourg. No news since. I don't know what he's doing \nthere, or even if he's still there. Has he called you? She shakes her head \"no\". \nANNA Did you try the gym? \nSTEPHANIE Yeah. They don't know. \nANNA If I had an address or a number, I'd give it to you... Even if I think it's dumb. Do you believe me? \nSTEPHANIE Yes. \nANNA After what he did to me... Sam sees Stephanie join Anna near the door. She's about to leave. \nANNA He abandoned his kid. He doesn't give a fuck about anything. All he ever cared about was himself. He's totally selfish. Sam watches the two women swallowed up by the light. \nSTEPHANIE (OFF) You don't know him. \nANNA (OFF) Me? What did you expect with him? \nSTEPHANIE (OFF) I don't know. Not this. Fade to black. Black. \n132. EXT. ALSATIAN COUNTRYSIDE. MORNING \nA frosty landscape with trees that look like they've been engraved in ink... A group of twelve joggers in blue track suits run across a landscape of gray sky and snow. Some shadowbox while running. Ali is wearing a wool cap pulled down around his ears. He runs alongside Foued. \n133. INT. HOLIDAY VILLAGE. GYM. DAY \nA ring has been set up in the middle of the gym. A few guys have gathered round to watch Ali rhythmically pound on his trainer's bear-like paws. Leonardini sets the pace. \nSAM No, they're skating. \nALI They're skiing, I said! \nSAM Skating. A few steps on: \nALI Skiing. \nSAM You're annoying me. They take a break at a picnic area, where they eat some sandwiches and drink orange soda. \nALI (his mouth full) Does Auntie still have dogs? \nSAM No, now it's chickens. \nALI In the garden? \nSAM Yeah, in the cage. They lay eggs. \nALI That's good. \nSAM But Auntie doesn't want me to take the chicks in my room. \nALI She's right. They're disgusting. (pointing to his sandwich) Finished? You want some \napplesauce? Afternoon. On the way back, they find a frozen pond. Ali carefully advances on the ice. He tests it. Jumps on it. Then he lets himself go and glides across the ice. \nALI You can go. But not too far! Sam starts slipping and sliding. He falls down. He lies on the sled and lets it glide. Ali pees behind a tree. Sam is far away. \nALI Come on, we have to head back! \nSAM 5 minutes. \nALI Now! \nSAM (showing his fingers) 5 minutes! \nALI 5 minutes. And then suddenly, instead of gliding, the child sinks. He tries to climb out and sinks again. A thin layer of ice is forming over him. \nSAM Daddy! Daddy! \nALI Shit! Ali rushes to the pond, but Sam is already iced over. He kneels down and then crawls on his stomach toward the hole. Sam has disappeared. Ali shoves aside snow. He looks everywhere, but sees nothing. And then he hears a noise, blows like signals coming from under the ice. Ali crawls \nover and clears away snow as best he can. Under the ice, he sees Sam's face, staring wide-eyed. Ali begins to pound both his fists on the ice, like pistons or pestles... As if pounding on his punching bag. \n139. UNDER THE ICE. DAY Underwater, we hear the sound of dull thuds. Sam sees his father's fists pound on the ice. He sees bloodstains. The ice cracks, a bloody fist searches the water for him. Sam closes his eyes. \n140. EXT. POND. EVENING \nEvening is falling. Ali has stretched Sam out on the rim of the pond. The child has turned blue. He tries mouth-to- mouth resuscitation, he massages his heart and rubs him down. \n141. EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. EVENING \nAli's respiration has become a grunt, then a groan. He runs. He has stowed Sam behind the front of his parka and runs as fast as he can. He slips, gets back up and runs again... he again breathes into Sam's mouth... while still running... \n142. INT. STRASBOURG - HOSPITAL - ICU. DAY \nLeaning against the window of the Intensive Care Unit, Ali sees Sam's nude, tiny body being worked on by doctors... his skin is blue from the cold... there is a tube in his mouth... his ribs rise and fall to the rhythm of a respirator... his mouth spits out brackish water brutally... A door opens and a nurse appears. Ali straightens up. \nNURSE We'll take care of you. Come with me. He doesn't understand. Then he notices the blood prints his hands have left on the ICU window. He looks at his scarred fingers, his broken, bloodied hands. \n", "test1_input": "OWNER Drink? He shakes his head \"no\". The boss notes something in a file. \n20. INT. ALTA SECURITY OFFICE. DAY. \nAnna and Sam are waiting outside the office. The owner kisses Anna on the cheek. He asks how Richard is doing, then shows them to the door. Anna looks proud to know him. \n21. EXT. FEVER RAY. NIGHT \nSaturday evening. The door to the Fever Ray night club. Patrons wait, bouncers pick and choose. An imposing Caucasian maneuvers the red rope. Behind him, Ali Van Versch and Foued Latahoui, who looks like a lightweight boxer, guard the door. Ali wears a faded blue \"ALTA Secu\" jacket and stiff, matching pants. Looking well-groomed, Foued is wearing a white shirt and tie. Well-groomed. A group of girls passes through the security barrier. Foued acts like he's hesitating: \nFOUED Okay, I'll let you through because I'm outnumbered. Four against one, I don't stand a chance! The girls smile and disappear inside. Ali watches them vanish. \nFOUED You say something nice, anything. That way, when they leave, they remember you and you can hit on them. If they're a little plastered, if things didn't go too well for them, you're there with a nice thing to say... \nALI And it works? \nFOUED Sometimes. But you can't be dressed like that. Like a parking lot attendant... They are interrupted by the bouncer. \nTHE CAUCASIAN (pointing) Fight! They go running. Three guys are fighting like savages. Ali and Foued clean house. Foued gets rid of gawkers. Ali delivers a few random punches, lifts one of the guys off \nhis feet and grabs another by the collar. While Foued chases the rowdy men toward the parking lot, Ali helps a girl back to her feet. She's a pretty blond, must be about 27 or 28, who has taken a punch in the face. It is Stephanie. \nALI Are you okay? Breathe out of your mouth. In and out. Put your head back. Walk a little. Walk and breathe... He demonstrates how and takes her by the arm, forcing her to walk. She looks groggy. \nSTEPHANIE I have to go home... \nALI You have friends here? \nSTEPHANIE No, I came alone. I have my car in the lot. I'll be fine. \nALI You can't drive like that. \nSTEPHANIE I'm fine. I'm fine, I said. Thanks. \nALI You can't drive like that. I'll call you a cab. \nSTEPHANIE How do I get my car afterwards? Seriously, I'll be fine. Trust me! We hear a voice from the parking lot. \nANGRY MAN Bitch! Stephanie looks back. \nANGRY MAN Yeah... you, you cunt. Bitch! She ignores him, pretending not to see him. She then notices the blood stains on her T-shirt. \nSTEPHANIE Shit. \nALI Where's your car? \n22. INT. STEPHANIE'S CAR. NIGHT \nAli drives. His head seems to touch the roof of the little Fiat and his thighs are too thick for the seat. He glances over at Stephanie. \nALI Still bleeding? Keep your head back. Wait... He manipulates the knob to push her seat back. He grimaces in pain. \nALI Shit! \nSTEPHANIE Did you hurt yourself? He shows her his right wrist. \nSTEPHANIE It's swelling up. He rests his hand on the wheel. After a beat: \nALI You often go to the Fever? \n", "test1_true": "ALI Why do you go alone? No answer. \nALI To dance? \nSTEPHANIE Yes. \nALI To find a guy? She turns and looks down her nose at him: \nSTEPHANIE Oh yeah? \nALI You're dressed like that just for dancing? \nSTEPHANIE How am I dressed? \nALI I don't know... Look. He points to her skirt, riding up her thighs. \nSTEPHANIE Yeah, so what? \nALI You look like a hooker. \nSTEPHANIE Excuse me? \nALI How would you call it? \nSTEPHANIE I don't believe this. Pull over here! \nALI What? \nSTEPHANIE Stop this car on the double! \nNo reaction. \nSTEPHANIE It's MY car! If I tell you to stop, you stop! Still no reaction, as if she hadn't said a thing. She is about to scream again, but remains silent, although open- mouthed. She finally settles back down on the back of her seat and looks elsewhere. A beat. \nALI Dressed like that, it's no surprise that... \nSTEPHANIE That's enough now! They ride in silence. \n23. EXT. SIMON & STEPHANIE'S BUILDING. NIGHT \nThe Fiat stops in front of a small building in a flowery residential neighborhood. They climb out. \nSTEPHANIE How will you get back? \nALI I don't know. She takes out her wallet. \nALI No, stop! \nSTEPHANIE For a taxi. \nALI Don't worry. Got any ice at your place? He shows her his wrist. \nALI Ice cubes. \nSTEPHANIE Wait, I'll go check. \nALI I can come up. \nSTEPHANIE No! Even she is surprised by the brusqueness of her response. \n", "test2_input": "STEPHANIE Okay, are you done? We can stop here. No need to spoil the rest of your internship. Louise stands up. \n27. EXT. MARINELAND. POOL - DAY \nThe empty stadium above the pool. The trainers walk along the gangplanks busily. In her diving suit, Stephanie leans over the \"beach\" of pool 3. She taps on the surface of the water. A wave forms, whirling around the pool. The whale washes up on the \"beach\" beside her. She performs what looks like a daily ritual. She examines the whale, caresses it. The whale responds with uncanny gurgles. \n28. EXT. MARINELAND. DAY \nStock shots of a show at Marineland, or images which we will film to resemble stock shots: wide-angle shots from the stadium. The sound equipment blares \"Jump\" by Van Halen, orcas shoot out of the water, the audience applauds\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Little kids clutch electric-blue dolphin balloons, getting splashed by the orcas\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Images of the show are relayed on giant video screens, orcas shoot by like torpedoes behind the plastic protective wall in front of the main pool, etc\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \nCUT TO: \n29. INT. MARINELAND POOL. DAY \nAll at once, silence. Then surface noise, but muted by the cubic meters of water\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Underwater shots from pool number 3. Overhead, the surface shines like a mirror. In pool number 3, a five-ton black shadow bides its time: it is Niska. Behind the grate in pool number 3, Niska watches her mates diving and surfacing in a spray of bubbles. A mechanical creak, then the grate slowly begins to lift. It's about to be her turn. \nNiska swims into the big pool, slowly at first, but then picks up speed. She surfaces, disappears for a long beat, then again reappears, churning up a whirlpool of bubbles. On the other side of the mirror, the music blares and the crowd cheers. What looks like a small black and white arrow dives into the pool. We recognize Stephanie. She caresses Niska's rostrum, then kisses it, hanging onto her fins, waltzing with her up to the surface. Her hands look ridiculously tiny on the huge black fins. We see her face mirrored in one of the orca's huge black, gentle eyes. A liquid world of greens and blues whirls around them. Now, with her legs slightly arched on the rostrum, Stephanie has Niska swim around the pool, accelerating the water pressure and speed. The plastic wall rushes by, a rush of adrenaline\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 clouds of sediment are lifted as if by a gust of wind. A young male, Tom, joins Niska in pool number 1. Niska immediately rushes him, as if riled by the intrusion, and flattens him against the plastic wall. In the shifting reflections at the water's surface, we can make out Stephanie and two other trainers' faces on the \u00e2\u0080\u0098beach'. Their palms beat on the water, summoning the orcas for their next number. Tom gathers some momentum, then shoots around Niska to jump into first place. He disappears a moment, then is back into the water after a dozen meters of aquaplaning. Niska then gets into place and takes a running start, but just as she is about to shoot out of the water, Tom appears out of nowhere and forces the huge female to leap over him. We sense chaos up above. Then we see Niska crash back into the water, with, one after the other, a piece of the huge video screen that towered over the stage, bits of scenery, and all kinds of random objects, as if Niska had carried away half the platform in her wake\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It all seems to fall in slow motion, like flecks of snow in a snow globe. Something sinks toward us\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 a body, floating weightless and disjointed in a cloud of red. \n30. EXT. MARINELAND - WHALE POOL. DAY \nStephanie is on the rim of the pool. All around her: the audience panics, a loudspeaker orders evacuation, Louise leans over her. \nSTEPHANIE What... What happened? \nLOUISE Tom and Niska... They got in each other's way. Then Louise sees blood spurting from the rips in her diving suit. She tries to find a pressure point. Stephanie sees Louise's face wet with tears: \nSTEPHANIE Stop it, calm down. I'm fine! Her hand searches for something at thigh level, without finding it. She faints. \n31. EXT. ROAD TO THE BEACH. DAY \nAli is wearing his MP3 headset. He runs down the road to the beach, sweat dripping into his eyes. \n32. EXT. ANNA'S HOUSE. DAY \nSam's toys are lying scattered in the garden, his half- eaten snack is on the table. Ali takes off his headset. \nALI Sam! No answer. There is some noise over at the kennel. He goes and finds Sam in the kennel, talking to the puppies. \nALI What are you doing here? \nSam jumps and scuttles to the back of the kennel, but Ali reaches in and grabs him by the arm. Sam is covered in mud, straw and dog shit. \nALI You're gross! You stink! Who's taking care of you? Ali drags him over to the garage to hose him down. The water is freezing cold. Sam hops from one foot to the other and screams. \nSAM Stop it, Dad! It's cold. Stop! Sam shrieks. An 18 year old tomboy wearing a skimpy tee- shirt comes out of a neighboring house: Joelle, the neighbors' daughter. \nALI Aren't you supposed to be taking care of him? What the fuck are you up to? \nJOELLE I was next doing the laundry. \nALI Take a look at him! \nJOELLE I'll put him in the shower. \nALI (to Sam, crying) Don't go in there. It's disgusting. You hear? Joelle takes Sam and disappears inside. Ali is drawn to the living room, when through the half-open door he notices the flat screen turned onto a news channel. Onscreen and behind the anchorwoman, he recognizes an inset photo of Stephanie, the same he saw at her place, riding on the back of a killer whale. \u00ef\u0080\u0081\u00ef\u0080\u0082\u00ef\u0080\u0083\u00ef\u0080\u0083\u00ef\u0080\u0084\u00ef\u0080\u0085\u00ef\u0080\u0086\u00ef\u0080\u0087\u00ef\u0080\u0088\u00ef\u0080\u0089\u00ef\u0080\u0084\u00ef\u0080\u008a\u00ef\u0080\u008b\u00ef\u0080\u008c\u00ef\u0080\u008d\u00ef\u0080\u008e\u00ef\u0080\u008f\u00ef\u0080\u008f\u00ef\u0080\u0088\u00ef\u0080\u0090\u00ef\u0080\u0084\u00ef\u0080\u0091\u00ef\u0080\u0092\u00ef\u0080\u008a\u00ef\u0080\u0093\u00ef\u0080\u008a Il manque une phrase \nJOELLE There was an accident at Marineland. Ali answers without taking his eyes off the screen. \nALI I know her. Sam pulls off his towel. He watches his father who is riveted to the screen, glued to the looping footage of the accident. \n", "test2_true": "Silence. The silence of an on-duty nurses' lounge: a table, a microwave on a mini-fridge, and Louise, standing by the window sipping coffee. She is wearing a fleece jacket, her hair messily pulled back. She hasn't had any sleep. She hears a scream. She rushes into the corridor. \n34. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. NIGHT \nChaos. Louise rushes into the room. She finds Stephanie crawling on the floor, dragging her IVs. She hesitates, overwhelmed, then calls for help. \nLOUISE Help! Help! Please! On the linoleum, two stumps stick out of Stephanie's nightshirt: two thick bandages surround her thighs that look like two wrapped hams. \nSTEPHANIE My legs! What did you do with my legs? Two nurses arrive. Stephanie is back in bed, the IVs in her arms. Louise rocks her gently. Stephanie's eyes struggle against sleep. She wants to scream again, but doesn't have the strength. She \nfalls asleep in Louise's arms. She feels eight years old. Black. \n35. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. DAY/NIGHT \nA series of scenes, day and night, fade into one another, always from the same POV. In the foreground, looking our way, is Stephanie's face and, behind, the visitors who succeed one another. Stephanie's eyes are shut. She opens them: - The other trainers from Marineland, holding bouquets. They are silent and look devastated. They occasionally speak to each other in whispers. Stephanie closes her eyes. Black. Stephanie opens her eyes: - Louise is seated nearby \nLOUISE I stopped by your place. I saw the cleaning woman. She didn't want me to pay her. She was... in shock. She's scared to come here. She sends her regards. She closes her eyes. Black. She opens them. - A blonde, pretty woman in her fifties is sitting behind Stephanie, her face is close to hers. It is her mother. She speaks with a slight accent. \nMOTHER I spoke to your brothers. They wanted to talk to you but I didn't think it was the right time. We'll all come with Hugo during the next school break... I was afraid I might lose you. I don't know what I'd have \ndone... It may seem selfish. In any case, you've always done whatever you wanted. But this time I was so scared that I don't think I'll ever be scared again. Her eyes close. Black. Her eyes reopen. The surgeon and his assistants. The orthopedist and his assistants. Her eyes close. Black. Her eyes open. - Simon is there, looking stiff and ill at ease. He tries not to make any noise as he puts a bunch of keys on the night stand. He leans over and kisses her hair. Her eyes close. Black. It's her mother again, but this time accompanied by a tall, uncomfortable looking blond teenage boy. She leans over to kiss her. \nMOTHER (in German) Hugo wanted to say goodbye to you. We're leaving tomorrow but we'll pray for you, honey. Her eyes remain open. Black. \n36. EXT. MARINELAND. NIGHT \nThe bluish light at the bottom the main pool at Marineland. A diver is raking its bottom, wiping away sludge composed of micro algae, paint chips and fish bones. He examines the replacement mud and then, inside the drain, the mud being replaced. He digs his hand into the sediment and feels something there. He surfaces and deposits his find on the rim of the pool: It is one of Stephanie's diving flippers, with her foot cut off at the ankle. \nCUT TO: \n37. INT. STEPHANIE'S NEW APARTMENT - BATHROOM. NIGHT \nStephanie wakes up with a start in her handicapped bathtub. She tries to grab the bars but can't find them. She rolls over on herself like a floating log. She panics. \nCUT TO: \n38. INT. HOSPITAL - PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - EVENING \nThere are several rows of parallel bars, with amputees hanging on to them as they relearn to walk with their prosthetics. Most of them are old. Nurses help them along. From her wheelchair, Stephanie watches, looking glum and as if at a great distance. Her hair is greasy and her face swollen by her medication and induced sleep. She looks through the big window that opens onto the exterior. Outside, amputees smoke and chat. She notices one group, livelier than the rest. At its center, a guy is smoking a cigarette he holds in a pincer in the place of his hand. His name is Gilles. \n39. INT. GILLES' CAR. EVENING \nFour of them are smoking a joint in Gilles' Megane. Outside, evening is falling over the convalescent center's parking lot. Stephanie is sitting up front. She passes the joint to Gilles, who takes it in his chrome pincer. She notices the scar that deforms his face and one side of his mouth. There is a couple in the backseat, making out: Raphael (his arms are missing and his sleeves are pinned up at his shoulders) and Julia. \nGILLES (to Stephanie) Want me to tell you something? \nSTEPHANIE \nGILLES You haven't finished mourning, that's all! \nSTEPHANIE Really? Mourning who? \nGILLES Your legs. \nSTEPHANIE Mourning my legs? \nGILLES Yes. He sounds as serious as a civics teacher. She looks at him, incredulous. Raphael sticks his head up front. \nRAPHAEL Pass me the joint... Gilles' pincer and joint go for Raphael's lips. He takes a long hit. \n", "test3_input": "STEPHANIE Turn on the water when you pee. It's disgusting. He runs some water. \n119. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT. DAWN \nHe carries her back into the bedroom. She looks at his face, the scar on his forehead, the scar over his nose. \nSTEPHANIE How's your nose? \nALI Mm. \nSTEPHANIE It doesn't seem broken. \nALI No. They look at each other. He puts her down on the bed and lies down next to her. Stephanie slides over to him. He lifts her up and places her on her stomach. They remain like that, without moving. She looks like a mermaid lolling on a rock. She leans over and kisses him on the mouth. He pulls away, surprised. \nALI Now we're allowed? No answer. They make love. In CU: the tattoo on Stephanie's left thigh. A red and black arrow with, in industrial characters: \"LEFT\". \n120. EXT/INT. NISSAN SUV. DAY \nMusic. \nThe road speeds by. Sun. Road signs with the names of Italian cities. The landscape has changed. Wearing her baseball cap and sunglasses, Stephanie drives with her elbow out the window. On the radio, we hear the voice of an Italian DJ. \n121. EXT. COASTAL ROAD. DAY \nAli jogs along the sea shore. He sweats, huffing and puffing. He stops, takes a few steps, then continues, but soon stops again. It looks as if his feet are weighing him down. Traffic speeds by. He stands still and stares into the near distance. Nothing. \n122. INT. TURIN - HOTEL. EVENING \nA standard hotel lobby. Curious, Stephanie looks at the crowd of fighters the day before the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ultimate' tournament: muscle-bound giants squeezed into tight jackets, with bashed in eyebrows, collapsed nostrils, cauliflower ears... Every language can be heard, some greet each other, some hug, they all size each other up... \nCUT TO: Propped up on her cane, she heads for a table in a corner of the bar where a man is consulting his cell phone. \nSTEPHANIE (in German) Mr. Bower? \nG\u00c3\u008cNTHER (in German) Yes? \nSTEPHANIE (in German) I'm Stephanie Granget. G\u00c3\u00bcnther looks about fifty and has obviously spent many of those years in the ring. \nCUT TO: \nSettled in a corner in front of their open PCs, Stephanie and G\u00c3\u00bcnther talk shop. \nCUT TO: They are about to separate. \nSTEPHANIE (in German) Can you get me a ticket for tonight? \nG\u00c3\u008cNTHER (in German) I don't know. I'll see what I can do. (pointing to her legs) What happened to your legs? \nSTEPHANIE An accident. In another life. I was an animal trainer. I worked with orcas... The show took a turn for the worse. \nG\u00c3\u008cNTHER (it dawns on him) Oh, of course! In France! The accident! It was you?! I'm talking to a star! Stephanie makes a face. \nG\u00c3\u008cNTHER Yes, I am... Amazing. What courage! Bravo! I'm very honored, really. I was an idiot before! \nSTEPHANIE Why? \nG\u00c3\u008cNTHER I acted like an arrogant business man. I'm so ashamed. Will you forgive me? \nSTEPHANIE Of course, Mr. Bower. \n", "test3_true": "123. INT. TURIN - GYM. NIGHT \nBleachers have been set up in a gym, surrounding a cage- like, fenced-in ring. Inside, combatants fight, no rules, no holds barred. On the floor, two wrestlers clasp and elbow each other. One is bleeding from the forehead. Below the ring, Stephanie is mesmerized by this carnival of violence. G\u00c3\u00bcnther leans toward her: \nG\u00c3\u008cNTHER (in German) Funny, huh? \nSTEPHANIE (in German) What? That? \nG\u00c3\u008cNTHER That... and you! \n124. INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT \nStephanie walks down a corridor. She stops in front of a door and knocks. G\u00c3\u00bcnther opens. He looks surprised. He is barefoot, in a pair of trousers and an unbuttoned shirt. He looks at her inquisitively, and when she still doesn't \nSAY ANYTHING: G\u00c3\u009cNTHER (in German) Are you okay? Do you need anything? She hesitates. STEPHANIE (in German) I... I came to see if I got it wrong, or not. He knits his brow. G\u00c3\u009cNTHER (in German) Got what wrong? STEPHANIE (in German) You don't understand? \nG\u00c3\u009cNTHER (in German) Excuse me? STEPHANIE (in German) I got the impression, the way you were looking at me before... Try to understand because this is getting hard for me... G\u00c3\u009cNTHER (in German) No, you didn't get it wrong. He smiles and opens the door. G\u00c3\u009cNTHER (in German) I have someone in my life, you know. \nSTEPHANIE So do I. He draws her inside. The door closes. \n125. INT. SUPERMARKET. DAY \nAnna is about to open her cash register, when a West Indian in a security uniform whispers into her ear, apparently asking her to follow him. Another cashier is already waiting to take her place. Anna joins three other employees waiting in a corridor. They exchange a few words under their breath. \n126. INT. SUPERMARKET - CORRIDOR - ADMINISTRATION. DAY \nAnna comes out of an office, looking distraught. She has to lean against the wall to hold herself up. A colleague comes to help. \nCOLLEAGUE So? \nANNA I got fired. \nCOLLEAGUE Come on. There's something we want to show you. \nIn the locker room, we recognize the girl who had photographed Ali while he was trying to reclaim Martial's camera equipment. The girl says something to Anna. When it seems that Anna can not believe her ears, the girl takes out her cell phone and confronts her with the evidence. Anna needs to sit down. \n127. EXT. HOUSE. DAY \nOut of breath, Ali pushes open the gate and climbs the stairs. \n128. INT. KITCHEN. DAY \nIn the kitchen, Anna and Richard are sitting at the table in front of a meal they haven't had the appetite to start. \nALI You okay? No answer. \nALI You don't seem it. He goes to open the fridge. \nANNA What are you doing? \nALI I'm hungry. \nANNA Close it! Don't eat here. Ali stares at her, stunned. \nANNA Don't eat here. \nALI What the hell is going on? \nANNA I was fired this morning. I'm unemployed. \n"}

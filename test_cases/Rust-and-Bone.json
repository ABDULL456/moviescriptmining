{"test1_input": "STEPHANIE Okay, are you done? We can stop here. No need to spoil the rest of your internship. Louise stands up. \n27. EXT. MARINELAND. POOL - DAY \nThe empty stadium above the pool. The trainers walk along the gangplanks busily. In her diving suit, Stephanie leans over the \"beach\" of pool 3. She taps on the surface of the water. A wave forms, whirling around the pool. The whale washes up on the \"beach\" beside her. She performs what looks like a daily ritual. She examines the whale, caresses it. The whale responds with uncanny gurgles. \n28. EXT. MARINELAND. DAY \nStock shots of a show at Marineland, or images which we will film to resemble stock shots: wide-angle shots from the stadium. The sound equipment blares \"Jump\" by Van Halen, orcas shoot out of the water, the audience applauds\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Little kids clutch electric-blue dolphin balloons, getting splashed by the orcas\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Images of the show are relayed on giant video screens, orcas shoot by like torpedoes behind the plastic protective wall in front of the main pool, etc\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \nCUT TO: \n29. INT. MARINELAND POOL. DAY \nAll at once, silence. Then surface noise, but muted by the cubic meters of water\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Underwater shots from pool number 3. Overhead, the surface shines like a mirror. In pool number 3, a five-ton black shadow bides its time: it is Niska. Behind the grate in pool number 3, Niska watches her mates diving and surfacing in a spray of bubbles. A mechanical creak, then the grate slowly begins to lift. It's about to be her turn. \nNiska swims into the big pool, slowly at first, but then picks up speed. She surfaces, disappears for a long beat, then again reappears, churning up a whirlpool of bubbles. On the other side of the mirror, the music blares and the crowd cheers. What looks like a small black and white arrow dives into the pool. We recognize Stephanie. She caresses Niska's rostrum, then kisses it, hanging onto her fins, waltzing with her up to the surface. Her hands look ridiculously tiny on the huge black fins. We see her face mirrored in one of the orca's huge black, gentle eyes. A liquid world of greens and blues whirls around them. Now, with her legs slightly arched on the rostrum, Stephanie has Niska swim around the pool, accelerating the water pressure and speed. The plastic wall rushes by, a rush of adrenaline\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 clouds of sediment are lifted as if by a gust of wind. A young male, Tom, joins Niska in pool number 1. Niska immediately rushes him, as if riled by the intrusion, and flattens him against the plastic wall. In the shifting reflections at the water's surface, we can make out Stephanie and two other trainers' faces on the \u00e2\u0080\u0098beach'. Their palms beat on the water, summoning the orcas for their next number. Tom gathers some momentum, then shoots around Niska to jump into first place. He disappears a moment, then is back into the water after a dozen meters of aquaplaning. Niska then gets into place and takes a running start, but just as she is about to shoot out of the water, Tom appears out of nowhere and forces the huge female to leap over him. We sense chaos up above. Then we see Niska crash back into the water, with, one after the other, a piece of the huge video screen that towered over the stage, bits of scenery, and all kinds of random objects, as if Niska had carried away half the platform in her wake\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It all seems to fall in slow motion, like flecks of snow in a snow globe. Something sinks toward us\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 a body, floating weightless and disjointed in a cloud of red. \n30. EXT. MARINELAND - WHALE POOL. DAY \nStephanie is on the rim of the pool. All around her: the audience panics, a loudspeaker orders evacuation, Louise leans over her. \nSTEPHANIE What... What happened? \nLOUISE Tom and Niska... They got in each other's way. Then Louise sees blood spurting from the rips in her diving suit. She tries to find a pressure point. Stephanie sees Louise's face wet with tears: \nSTEPHANIE Stop it, calm down. I'm fine! Her hand searches for something at thigh level, without finding it. She faints. \n31. EXT. ROAD TO THE BEACH. DAY \nAli is wearing his MP3 headset. He runs down the road to the beach, sweat dripping into his eyes. \n32. EXT. ANNA'S HOUSE. DAY \nSam's toys are lying scattered in the garden, his half- eaten snack is on the table. Ali takes off his headset. \nALI Sam! No answer. There is some noise over at the kennel. He goes and finds Sam in the kennel, talking to the puppies. \nALI What are you doing here? \nSam jumps and scuttles to the back of the kennel, but Ali reaches in and grabs him by the arm. Sam is covered in mud, straw and dog shit. \nALI You're gross! You stink! Who's taking care of you? Ali drags him over to the garage to hose him down. The water is freezing cold. Sam hops from one foot to the other and screams. \nSAM Stop it, Dad! It's cold. Stop! Sam shrieks. An 18 year old tomboy wearing a skimpy tee- shirt comes out of a neighboring house: Joelle, the neighbors' daughter. \nALI Aren't you supposed to be taking care of him? What the fuck are you up to? \nJOELLE I was next doing the laundry. \nALI Take a look at him! \nJOELLE I'll put him in the shower. \nALI (to Sam, crying) Don't go in there. It's disgusting. You hear? Joelle takes Sam and disappears inside. Ali is drawn to the living room, when through the half-open door he notices the flat screen turned onto a news channel. Onscreen and behind the anchorwoman, he recognizes an inset photo of Stephanie, the same he saw at her place, riding on the back of a killer whale. \u00ef\u0080\u0081\u00ef\u0080\u0082\u00ef\u0080\u0083\u00ef\u0080\u0083\u00ef\u0080\u0084\u00ef\u0080\u0085\u00ef\u0080\u0086\u00ef\u0080\u0087\u00ef\u0080\u0088\u00ef\u0080\u0089\u00ef\u0080\u0084\u00ef\u0080\u008a\u00ef\u0080\u008b\u00ef\u0080\u008c\u00ef\u0080\u008d\u00ef\u0080\u008e\u00ef\u0080\u008f\u00ef\u0080\u008f\u00ef\u0080\u0088\u00ef\u0080\u0090\u00ef\u0080\u0084\u00ef\u0080\u0091\u00ef\u0080\u0092\u00ef\u0080\u008a\u00ef\u0080\u0093\u00ef\u0080\u008a Il manque une phrase \nJOELLE There was an accident at Marineland. Ali answers without taking his eyes off the screen. \nALI I know her. Sam pulls off his towel. He watches his father who is riveted to the screen, glued to the looping footage of the accident. \n", "test1_true": "Silence. The silence of an on-duty nurses' lounge: a table, a microwave on a mini-fridge, and Louise, standing by the window sipping coffee. She is wearing a fleece jacket, her hair messily pulled back. She hasn't had any sleep. She hears a scream. She rushes into the corridor. \n34. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. NIGHT \nChaos. Louise rushes into the room. She finds Stephanie crawling on the floor, dragging her IVs. She hesitates, overwhelmed, then calls for help. \nLOUISE Help! Help! Please! On the linoleum, two stumps stick out of Stephanie's nightshirt: two thick bandages surround her thighs that look like two wrapped hams. \nSTEPHANIE My legs! What did you do with my legs? Two nurses arrive. Stephanie is back in bed, the IVs in her arms. Louise rocks her gently. Stephanie's eyes struggle against sleep. She wants to scream again, but doesn't have the strength. She \nfalls asleep in Louise's arms. She feels eight years old. Black. \n35. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. DAY/NIGHT \nA series of scenes, day and night, fade into one another, always from the same POV. In the foreground, looking our way, is Stephanie's face and, behind, the visitors who succeed one another. Stephanie's eyes are shut. She opens them: - The other trainers from Marineland, holding bouquets. They are silent and look devastated. They occasionally speak to each other in whispers. Stephanie closes her eyes. Black. Stephanie opens her eyes: - Louise is seated nearby \nLOUISE I stopped by your place. I saw the cleaning woman. She didn't want me to pay her. She was... in shock. She's scared to come here. She sends her regards. She closes her eyes. Black. She opens them. - A blonde, pretty woman in her fifties is sitting behind Stephanie, her face is close to hers. It is her mother. She speaks with a slight accent. \nMOTHER I spoke to your brothers. They wanted to talk to you but I didn't think it was the right time. We'll all come with Hugo during the next school break... I was afraid I might lose you. I don't know what I'd have \ndone... It may seem selfish. In any case, you've always done whatever you wanted. But this time I was so scared that I don't think I'll ever be scared again. Her eyes close. Black. Her eyes reopen. The surgeon and his assistants. The orthopedist and his assistants. Her eyes close. Black. Her eyes open. - Simon is there, looking stiff and ill at ease. He tries not to make any noise as he puts a bunch of keys on the night stand. He leans over and kisses her hair. Her eyes close. Black. It's her mother again, but this time accompanied by a tall, uncomfortable looking blond teenage boy. She leans over to kiss her. \nMOTHER (in German) Hugo wanted to say goodbye to you. We're leaving tomorrow but we'll pray for you, honey. Her eyes remain open. Black. \n36. EXT. MARINELAND. NIGHT \nThe bluish light at the bottom the main pool at Marineland. A diver is raking its bottom, wiping away sludge composed of micro algae, paint chips and fish bones. He examines the replacement mud and then, inside the drain, the mud being replaced. He digs his hand into the sediment and feels something there. He surfaces and deposits his find on the rim of the pool: It is one of Stephanie's diving flippers, with her foot cut off at the ankle. \nCUT TO: \n37. INT. STEPHANIE'S NEW APARTMENT - BATHROOM. NIGHT \nStephanie wakes up with a start in her handicapped bathtub. She tries to grab the bars but can't find them. She rolls over on herself like a floating log. She panics. \nCUT TO: \n38. INT. HOSPITAL - PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - EVENING \nThere are several rows of parallel bars, with amputees hanging on to them as they relearn to walk with their prosthetics. Most of them are old. Nurses help them along. From her wheelchair, Stephanie watches, looking glum and as if at a great distance. Her hair is greasy and her face swollen by her medication and induced sleep. She looks through the big window that opens onto the exterior. Outside, amputees smoke and chat. She notices one group, livelier than the rest. At its center, a guy is smoking a cigarette he holds in a pincer in the place of his hand. His name is Gilles. \n39. INT. GILLES' CAR. EVENING \nFour of them are smoking a joint in Gilles' Megane. Outside, evening is falling over the convalescent center's parking lot. Stephanie is sitting up front. She passes the joint to Gilles, who takes it in his chrome pincer. She notices the scar that deforms his face and one side of his mouth. There is a couple in the backseat, making out: Raphael (his arms are missing and his sleeves are pinned up at his shoulders) and Julia. \nGILLES (to Stephanie) Want me to tell you something? \nSTEPHANIE \nGILLES You haven't finished mourning, that's all! \nSTEPHANIE Really? Mourning who? \nGILLES Your legs. \nSTEPHANIE Mourning my legs? \nGILLES Yes. He sounds as serious as a civics teacher. She looks at him, incredulous. Raphael sticks his head up front. \nRAPHAEL Pass me the joint... Gilles' pincer and joint go for Raphael's lips. He takes a long hit. \n", "test1_id": 2196, "test2_input": "STEPHANIE If he's up for it. If he's free. If he is, we fuck. \nLOUISE Is that all? \nSTEPHANIE Yes, that's all. What else do you want? \nLOUISE I don't know. Is that enough? \nSTEPHANIE For me it is. \nLOUISE What does he do? Stephanie hesitates a moment, as if worried about how Louise will react. \nSTEPHANIE He fights. \nLOUISE What kind? MMA? \nSTEPHANIE No. Illicit fights in the projects. Louise reacts. \nSTEPHANIE Whatever I say, you make a face. \nLOUISE Just give me a second to react... Are you in love? She hesitates. \nSTEPHANIE He does me good. \n93. EXT. PARKING LOT. MARINELAND. DAY \nThe group of trainers has accompanied Stephanie to a taxi. \n94. INT. TAXI/PARKING LOT - MARINELAND. DAY \nStephanie waves good-bye. They return her wave. The taxi drives away. The group scatters. \nCUT TO: \n95. INT. BASEMENT. DAY \nA dark cellar. We hear Ali and Stephanie labor and sigh. A door suddenly opens above and we hear voices. \nALI Shit! \nSTEPHANIE Who is it? He looks for his clothes... \n96. EXT. GARDEN. DAY \n... then goes to the garden where he startles Anna: \nANNA I didn't know you were here. You scared me. What were you up to? \nALI I was talking? \nANNA You're not alone? \nALI I'm with a friend. \nANNA You bring girls back to my place now? \nALI She's a friend, I said. Just then, the basement door opens and Stephanie appears on her crutches. Anna is dismayed. Ali motions to Stephanie: \nALI (to Stephanie) Let me introduce you to my sister! (to Anna) This is Stephanie. You know the girl from Marineland. Stephanie offers her hand to Anna who takes it, then realizing what she's doing, puts the other to her mouth: \n", "test2_true": "Sam arrives with his snack. Stephanie looks at him. \nSTEPHANIE So that's him? They are sitting around the garden table. Anna comes carrying a tray. \nANNA They were out of grapefruit. I took tropical fruit. She puts some glasses and two tetra packs of fruit juice on the table. Through a hole in the oilcloth, Stephanie can watch Sam playing under the table. \nANNA I'll make tea. I have some cookies. You drink tea, don't you? \nSTEPHANIE Don't bother. This is perfect, I swear. Thanks. Before Stephanie can even finish, Anna is already on the way back to the kitchen. \nALI You don't want to get going? \nSTEPH Wait, your sister... \nALI You freak her out. Can't you see? She feels like a cashier with you. Pathetic with her tea and cookies. It's a pain. Stephanie leans on a cane to stand up. \nALI What are you doing? \nSTEPH I'm going to help her. \nALI No need to overdo it. \n97. INT. ANNA'S HOUSE. DAY \nLater, Sam guides Stephanie up the narrow stairs of the house. She has a hard time with her \u00e2\u0080\u0098legs' and canes. \n98. INT. SAM'S ROOM. DAY \nA child's room with cheap wall paper depicting dolphins. Stephanie is sitting on the edge of the bed. \nSTEPHANIE So this is where you sleep? It's a nice room. Sam nods in agreement. He gives her a strange look. \nSTEPHANIE Why are you looking at me like that? Does it scare you? You want to see them, is that it? He nods. She lifts one of her pant legs to show the prosthesis underneath. Sam looks attentively, stretches out his hand, touches it carefully. \nSAM Does it hurt? Stephanie smiles at him. \nSTEPHANIE No... Want to touch it? Sam reaches out his hand. \n99. INT. MARTIAL'S CAR. DAY \nIn CU through the tinted windows of Martial's Mercedes Vito: the face of a boxer who is lying on the ground and being pummeled. Ali is sitting bare-chested in the back seat, a towel around his neck and a bottle of water between his knees. \nAli watches the fight. Sitting next to him, Stephanie fills a plastic bag with ice cubes. She hands it to him. \nSTEPHANIE Here. He applies it to his eyebrow. She displaces a bloody strand of hair and replaces it with another. We see Martial return to the car and open the front door. \nMARTIAL You okay? He puts a wad of money in the glove compartment. \nMARTIAL You ready? Ali nods \u00e2\u0080\u0098yes'. He opens his door, gets half out and empties the bottle of water over his head. Stephanie is left alone in the car. She hears the spectators' cheers. She closes the window and turns on the air conditioning full blast. \n100. EXT. PROJECTS - COURTYARD. DAY \nHis opponent's guard is up, closed tighter than a safe. Behind his fists, Ali can see the guy's frozen stare. And then suddenly he breaks loose: a series of feints and a kick behind the ear. He hears himself growl, the light becomes electrifying. He is on the ground, protecting himself as best he can. He tries to block his opponent's arm. He hears himself wheezing and panting like a pair of bellows. He sees his blood splatter his opponent. \nALI (OFF) ... All of a sudden, in your mouth, it's like it tasted like bone. A taste of rust and bone. \nSTEPHANIE (OFF) Because you think bone has a taste? \nALI (OFF) Yeah, there I did. Then, through the spectators' legs, he sees something: sunlight reflected off the Mercedes door that has just opened on a pair of shoes attached to two prostheses, a pair of shorts\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He also sees the heads of the tough guys who turn back to look. He breaks free, struggles to his feet, spits up a clot of blood and returns to the task at hand. His opponent tries to get up. Ali jumps on him to finish \n", "test2_id": 2197, "test3_input": "ALI Shit... But what's the problem if I eat here? Anna stands up. \nANNA They had cameras in the storeroom... They filmed us when we took the expired food. They fired us. Ali's head spins. \nANNA You had your sister fired. How does it feel? How much did you get for that? You get paid per person or a flat rate? Nothing to say? I take you in, I take care of your son and you have nothing to say? \nALI I couldn't know... \nANNA You couldn't know? You couldn't know what? That you were screwing us out of jobs? That you were hurting people? Ali tries to find something to say, but his sister's hand delivers a resounding slap. He takes it like a man. A moment passes. Ali is red from the slap, red with shame\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 until he suddenly straightens up and knocks over the table. \nRICHARD Calm down. Calm down, I said! Ali looks back. He sees Richard's grim face at the other end of a hunting rifle. \nRICHARD Take your stuff and get out of here. We don't want to see you around here anymore. \nA sudden noise draws their attention: Sam is watching from the top of the stairs. \nANNA Go to your room. Go upstairs immediately. \n129. INT. ANNA'S HOUSE - BASEMENT. DAY \nAn SMS arrives from Stephanie: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlmost there. I miss you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ali is lying on his mattress. He puts down the phone. He hears Anna and Richard's voices upstairs. He sits up and begins to stuff things into a bag. A new message arrives: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm home. Oper?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ali hesitates, then turns off his phone and clicks his bag closed. \n130. INT. ANNA'S HOUSE - SAM'S ROOM. EVENING \nNight has fallen. Sam's nose is stuck to his bedroom window. He sees his aunt sitting at the plastic table in the garden downstairs with her face in her hands. A door slams. Sam rushes to the bathroom window. He sees his father stomp down the street, never once looking back. Sam remains glued to the window pane. Ali's silhouette moves through the halo of a streetlight before again disappearing into the dark. Sam watches him for as far as he can. Fade to black. \n131. INT/ EXT. BASEMENT. DAY \nIn the half-light of the basement, a rectangle of light has formed where the door opens onto the street. Stephanie looks over Ali's mess: his magazines, body building equipment, dirty T-shirts, track suits hanging over a trestle... Anna is standing against the light at the door and, a bit farther off, Sam is sitting on the stairs watching them. \nANNA In his message he said he was in Strasbourg. No news since. I don't know what he's doing \nthere, or even if he's still there. Has he called you? She shakes her head \"no\". \nANNA Did you try the gym? \nSTEPHANIE Yeah. They don't know. \nANNA If I had an address or a number, I'd give it to you... Even if I think it's dumb. Do you believe me? \nSTEPHANIE Yes. \nANNA After what he did to me... Sam sees Stephanie join Anna near the door. She's about to leave. \nANNA He abandoned his kid. He doesn't give a fuck about anything. All he ever cared about was himself. He's totally selfish. Sam watches the two women swallowed up by the light. \nSTEPHANIE (OFF) You don't know him. \nANNA (OFF) Me? What did you expect with him? \nSTEPHANIE (OFF) I don't know. Not this. Fade to black. Black. \n132. EXT. ALSATIAN COUNTRYSIDE. MORNING \nA frosty landscape with trees that look like they've been engraved in ink... A group of twelve joggers in blue track suits run across a landscape of gray sky and snow. Some shadowbox while running. Ali is wearing a wool cap pulled down around his ears. He runs alongside Foued. \n133. INT. HOLIDAY VILLAGE. GYM. DAY \nA ring has been set up in the middle of the gym. A few guys have gathered round to watch Ali rhythmically pound on his trainer's bear-like paws. Leonardini sets the pace. \n", "test3_true": "134. INT. HOLIDAY VILLAGE REC ROOM. EVENING \nYoung athletes, some tall, some short, some heavyset, some not, are sitting on refectory chairs to watch TV. Ali does too. His hair is cut short and his face is closely shaven. He looks younger. He could be a student. \n135. EXT. RICHARD'S TRUCK. NIGHT/DAY \nA truck rushes headlong through the countryside. First it is day, then night. \n136. INT. HOLIDAY VILLAGE. DAY \nThrough the window, Ali sees a twelve-ton Scania pull to a stop at the entrance to the parking lot and beep its horn. Ali runs out to meet it. \n137. EXT. HOLIDAY VILLAGE - PARKING LOT. DAY \nRichard lowers his window. \nRICHARD I can't come in any further or I won't be able to get back out! Ali checks out the huge semi. \nALI Looks like you changed trucks! \nRICHARD Bosses, in fact. I'm back to being exploited. Ali doesn't insist. Richard opens his door to let out Sam who is already trampling him, trying to get out. \nRICHARD (to Sam) Got everything? Your bag, your coat, your hat, your mittens? You haven't forgotten anything? Now give me a kiss. Sam gives him a kiss. Richard slips him out and into Ali's arms. \nALI How are things there? \nRICHARD They're okay. \nALI My sister? \nRICHARD She found a job at a school cafeteria. She seems to enjoy it. \nALI Does she know about today? \nRICHARD Yes. She says it's good for the kid. \nALI Tell her I can't help out for the time being but that as soon as I have a little money... \nRICHARD Don't worry. When's your fight? \nALI Next month. On the 9th. Richard smiles admiringly. \nRICHARD Keep us posted if you win. \nALI Sure I will. \nRICHARD Yeah, right... Okay, I'm off. I'll deliver my load in Colmar and pick up the kid at around 7, okay? \nALI Okay. \nRICHARD No later, because I have to be back tomorrow at 11. The two men say good-bye. Sam waves good-bye. \n138. EXT. ALSATIAN COUNTRYSIDE. DAY \nA path runs through fields and into a clump of fir trees. Ali pulls a plastic sled with Sam on top. Whenever there is a slope, he lets Sam glide down it and runs after him. Snow falls from the trees. He looks up and sees a couple of squirrels jump from branch to branch. Sam has never seen any before. Ali neither. Sunlight filters through the branches. A group of cross- country skiers trudges by. \nSAM I want to skate too! \nALI They're not skating. They're skiing. \n", "test3_id": 2198}

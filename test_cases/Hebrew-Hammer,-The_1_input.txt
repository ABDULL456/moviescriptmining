BLACK TEENAGER Oh shit! 
The teen runs inside. 
The Hammer's Caddy pulls up to a stop right at camera, giving us a full view of the license plate. It reads, "LCHAIM." 
INT. KWANZAA LIBERATION FRONT HQ - MOMENTS LATER 
A handful of BAAAD BROTHERS, decked out in a mixture of African clothing and combat gear relax to the sounds of mellow Blaxploitation music. 'KWANZAA NOW!' posters and other Pro-Kwanzaa propaganda hang on the walls of the room, machine guns rest idly against sofas,  blunts are passed around. We're talking Black Panthers here. A WHITE ACCOUNTANT counts money at a card table to the side of the room. 
The black teenager enters breathlessly. 
BLACK TEENAGER Hey, yo, we got ourselves a visitor. 
O.S., one of the BAAAD BROTHERS inquires. 
BAAAD BROTHER (O.S.) Who is it? 
BLACK TEENAGER It's some pimped out Hebrew dude in a caddy. 
The men scramble for their guns, inserting clips, and removing safeties. 
The front doors bust open, and we DOLLY into the Hammer. 
All guns are trained on him. 
From behind the frontline of gunmen, MOHAMMED, clearly the leader of the operation, pushes his way through. 
He walks towards the Hammer. You can feel the tension in the room. 
MOHAMMED The Hebrew Hammer! My main Kike! 
HAMMER Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim. My main nigga! 
The two embrace in a warm hug. The White Accountant looks up in shock from the card table. His nametag is clearly visible, and it reads, "WHITE ACCOUNTANT." He points at Mohammed. 
WHITE ACCOUNTANT You...you just called him a Kike. 
He points to the Hammer. 
WHITE ACCOUNTANT (CONT'D) And you. You just called him a Nigger. 
The Hammer and Mohammed look to one another. They're having a hard time understanding his concern. 
MOHAMMED Well it's okay when we call each other that. 
The White Accountant thinks it over for a second. 
WHITE ACCOUNTANT Oh. 
The other Brothers put their guns down and go back to their pre-Hammer activities, and the accountant takes his place back at the card table. 
Mohammed puts his arm around the Hammer. 
MOHAMMED So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF? 
HAMMER I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa? 
MOHAMMED Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode. 
The Hammer looks over at the Brothers smoking weed, making out with their girlfriends, etc. Mohammed takes notice. 
MOHAMMED (CONT'D) Gotta always be cool under pressure. You know what I'm sayin. 
HAMMER True dat. True dat. So, what's the word on the street? 
MOHAMMED Word is that papa's got a brand new bag, and it's velvety red, and it ain't gonna be overnight Fed-Exed to Jerusalem. If you know what I mean. 
This clearly flies over the Hammer's yarmulke.

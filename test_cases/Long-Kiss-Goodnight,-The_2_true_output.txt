INT. BUNKER - SAME TIME 
As the tanker snorts to a halt, TIMOTHY pulls up, driving a bright red Jaguar. Gets out as a blue-suit trots up: 
BLUE-SUIT 1800 hours. We're still trying to clean the tanker -- 
TIMOTHY (scowls annoyance) Fuck the cleaning, just drain it and reload. Chop-chop, I'm going bunjee jumping after this. 
EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - SAME TIME 
Charly and Henessey. Kneeling. He speaks tersely: 
HENESSEY Let me go in. 
CHARLY Negative. You stomp around like a forties drunk and you're a lousy shot. 
HENESSEY I get by. 
CHARLY You couldn't hit a lake if you were standing on the bottom, now shut the fuck up. 
Charly studies the encampment. Armed men. Impossible odds. Draws a long ragged breath and flops on the ground. Props her back against a tree. Staring. Lights a cigarette: 
CHARLY I saw a little girl. 
HENESSEY (frowns) Come again? 
CHARLY That's what happened under the water. That night, eight years ago. 
She looks up at the sky. Face troubled. 
CHARLY At the end... there she was, this pretty little girl at the bottom of the ocean, smiling at me. Three years old, didn't know Daddies hid in closets, not yet. Stared up at me in the strangest way... saying how'd it come to this, we were so pretty and perfect, now look at us, sinking with our head all open... Said when she grew up she was gonna teach school. She couldn't wait. 
She heaves a sigh. Threads a silencer on a baretta. 
CHARLY Guards are on 27-1 megahertz, meet me at 26-9, you need to talk. As soon as you spot me with the kid, start blowing the charges. 
Henessey nods. Pause -- she does something unexpected. Leans over and kisses him hard on the lips. He reacts, startled. She pulls back, the oddest look on her face. 
CHARLY They're gonna blow my head off, you know. (softly:) This is the last time I'll ever be pretty. 
She kisses him again. Softly. Tenderly. Pulls back, turns without a word. 
CHARLY Time now. What I do next, they tell me it... looks like a machine or something. You don't like it, don't look. 
She moves off toward the trees. Henessey shifts from foot to foot, awkwardly. Opens his mouth -- 
CHARLY Don't say it. 
HENESSEY I was gonna say enjoy life, eat out more often. 
CHARLY Gotta go. (beat) If she's alive, she's coming out of there, Mitch. If she's not... they'll know we stopped by. 
She's gone, like a wraith. CUT TO: 
SERIES OF SHOTS: Charly, on the prowl. In and out of the trees... BURYING C-4 CHARGES. In bushes. In snowdrifts. She crawls to woods' edge, peers out -- The motel stands solemn and bedraggled. Draws a sharp breath -- ! 
There's a LIT CANDLE in the window of 17. CUT TO: 
EXT. MOTEL GROUNDS - SAME TIME 
A gray-suited SENTRY. Poised on a wooded slope. He puts a walkie-talkie to his lips and says: 
SENTRY All clear. 
CHARLY, out of nowhere. Lightning fast. Hand, clamped on mouth. In goes the knife. Deep. He burbles blood. Drops. Before he hits, Charly's already switched from knife to gun and moved on. 
EXT. UNIT 17 - SAME TIME 
Charly appears from the shadows. Ghosts up to the window of #17 and peers in. Scans. Misses nothing. Crosses to the door, taps lightly. Watches the PEEPHOLE, a tiny pinprick of light. Abruptly darkened by a human eye -- 
She presses the silenced Beretta to the hole and fires. Sputs of splinters. From behind the door, a muffled thud. She goes to work on the lock. 
BACK WITH HENESSEY - MINUTES HAVE PASSED 
Henessey lies prone, binoculars trained on the motel. 
HENESSEY Christ, lady, what are you doing in there, playing fucking mah-jongg? *Move*. 
Behind him, a tiny, sharp click--! TIMOTHY has a Skorpion machine pistol aimed at his head. 
The killer speaks into a radio unit, a single word -- 
TIMOTHY Bogey. 
POP-! go the Kleig lights. BRILLIANCE, blinding -- CATCHES CHARLY coming out of 17. Pins her dead to rights. Unconscious DAUGHTER cradled in her arms. Tiny DOLL cradled in the kid's. Charly runs, as the ground around her erupts like a SHELLBURST. 
TIMOTHY, MEANWHILE, shouting into his walkie-talkie, saying: 
TIMOTHY Take her alive, Perkins wants her!

DUKE Oh, all right. Hang on. They don't call me the little dipper for nothing. 
He dips Anna back. Elsa peeks through the crowd, can barely hold in her laughter. Anna shoots Elsa funny, help-me looks. 
DUKE (CONT'D) (groove fully on) Like a chicken...with the face of a monkey...I fly. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
MOMENTS LATER... 
Anna limps back to Elsa. 
DUKE (O.S.) Let me know when you're ready for another round, M'Lady. 
ELSA Well, he was sprightly. 
ANNA (rubbing her sore feet) Especially for a man in heels. 
ELSA Are you okay? 
ANNA (loving Elsa's attention) I've never been better. This is so nice. I wish it could be like this all the time. 
ELSA (sincere) Me too.... 
But then Elsa catches herself. She stiffens up, looks away. 
ELSA (CONT'D) But it can't. 
ANNA Why not? If-- 
ELSA It just can't. FROZEN - J. Lee 
Anna's smile drops. She tries not to get emotional. 
ANNA Excuse me for a minute. 
She walks away. Elsa watches her go, saddened. 
Moving through the crowd, Anna gets bumped by a bowing man's butt. She falls. Just before she hits the floor, Hans catches her. He smiles perfectly. 
HANS Glad I caught you. 
ANNA Hans. 
He smoothly sets his drink down on a passing tray. He lifts her up and leads her in a romantic dance. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
LATER: Anna and Hans drink and chat. 
ANNA (CONT'D) I often had the whole parlor to myself to slide... Oops. Sorry. 
She hits him in the face by mistake with her hand. He laughs. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
-THE CASTLE DOORS: Anna and Hans stroll out of the castle. 
ANNA (CONT'D) ...Your physique helps I'm sure. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
-THE ROSE GARDEN... Hans notices her white streak. 
HANS (about her white streak) What's this? 
ANNA I was born with it, although I dreamt I was kissed by a troll. 
HANS I like it. 
DISSOLVE TO: FROZEN - J. Lee 
EXT. BALCONY -- NIGHT 
Anna teaches Hans how to eat krumkake. 
ANNA Yeah, the whole thing! You got it. 
They laugh as the krumkake crumbles in his face. 
ANNA(CONT'D) Okay wait, wait. So you have how many brothers? 
HANS Twelve older brothers. Three of them pretended I was invisible... literally...for two years. 
ANNA That's horrible. 
HANS It's what brothers do. 
ANNA ...And sisters. Elsa and I were really close when we were little. But then, one day she just shut me out, and I never knew why.

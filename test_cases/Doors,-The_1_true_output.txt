The cronies wait, anticipating something inescapably evil to escape his lips. 
BONES Yeah yeah, whatddaya think? 
JIM I think we gotta get really ripped! 
INT. TURKEY JOINT WEST - NIGHT 
Tall bespectacled RAY MANZAREK is banging out GLORIA on the piano in bad Jerry Lee Lewis style. 
RAY I tell you bout my baby 'bout five foot four from head to toe She came to my room Just 'bout midnight She makes me feel so good She makes me feel alright 
Camera moving to reveal JOHN DENSMORE wiry, solid on the drums... moving on to ROBBIE KRIEGER, wispy, ethereal looking, the youngest, flamenco-type moves on his early electric guitar. Also a HARMONICA PLAYER and a BASE. They all seem slightly embarrassed by either the cheap sound system feedback or Ray's warbling, but the crowd couldn't care less -- a German beerhall, they want noise and sex. 
JIM and his GANG, beers in hand, mouth back the words, beers everywhere shoved to the smokey ceiling, everyone on their feet, nuts with spring fever. Jim eyeing the GIRL next to him. 
JIM You know what I'd like to do to you? 
GIRL (waiting, intrigued) No what? 
JIM You really want to know what I'd like to do to you? 
GIRL What! 
The FOOTBALL TEAM TYPES edge over nearby, one of them picking out Jim with a glare. 
JIM (whispering) Wanna hear the scream of the butterfly... 
She looks puzzled by the suggestion. 
FOOTBALL PLAYER Hey Morrison! 
JIM (eluding the man) Can we have a couple of beers. You're not even an asshole man -- you're a semihole. 
He evades the football man's grasp, elusive physicality. He hops over tables, heading for the stage. Other KIDS are up on the stage dancing, but Jim goes right up alongside RAY, shaking his hips like Elvis. Ray giving him the mike. Improv time. 
JIM (singing) She came to my room She came on my floor She came on my bed She came on my face Ooooooh I want to wrap your legs around my head baby baby and her name was Gloria 
They love it. The place going wild. The girl with the football player wanting him. 
INT. RAY'S CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT 
JIM is insane on beers in the back seat, reaching over the wheel to try to drive the car for RAY who is flailing at him. Jim pulling Ray's hair... 
JIM (barely comprehensible) HA HA HA HA HA! COME ON, LET'S DRIVE TO MEXICO MAN. TIJUANA. LET'S GET LOST! 
Jammed into the sedan are TRICK, BONES, ROBBIE, JOHN... 
RAY & ALL COOL IT JIM, COME ON COOL IT. 
JIM FREEDOM!!! DON'T YOU KNOW YOU'RE ALL SLAVES! 
As he winds down the window and starts crawling out of the car. Heavy traffic. Ray weaving to avoid another vehicle. Honking horn. 
JOHN HE'S GOING OUT! HE'S GOING OUT! 
TRICK HE'S GONNA JUMP! 
RAY GET HIM BACK IN! 
His waist is out the window, John and all grabbing for his heels. 
EXT. SPEEDING CAR - NIGHT 
SPECIAL EFFECT: JIM's head six inches from pavement moving at 60 mph through heavy traffic. Screaming, laughing like a maniac. Beeping horns all over the place. 
JIM DEATH OLD FRIEND!! 
In the car, madness, raging chaos, the four boys pulling him in. 
EXT./INT. PAMELA'S HOUSE - VENICE CANAL - THAT NIGHT 
Night. Shadows. A tree. A figure moving. 
JIM (SONG) Awake! Shake dreams from your hair, my pretty child my sweet one Choose the day and choose the sign of your day The day's divinity the first thing you see 
Jim slides her upstairs' door open, crawls in next to her bed. She's asleep with her boyfriend. He touches her toe. She awakes, startled. 
JIM Come on, come out for a walk, it's a pretty night. 
PAM You're crazy! 
EXT. VENICE CANALS - NIGHT 
JIM and PAMELA moving along the byways. A clear starry California night. 
JIM (SONG) A vast radiant beach And a cool jewelled moon Couples naked, race down by its quiet side And we laugh like soft mad children 
There's a crash. They turn bristling. 
A COYOTE lurks under the sickly light of a streetlamp, pulling its head from an overstuffed garbage can, looking back at them. 
EXT. VENICE BOARDWALK - NIGHT 
Fires on the boardwalk. Hippies, Bums, Older People. JIM and PAM move through talking, skipping, touching like children. 
JIM (SONG) ...smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy The music and voices are all around us Choose, they croon, the ancient ones The time has come again 
EXT. VENICE BEACH - NIGHT

The lone car on the road. Snatches of war news from the radio are the only sound as the headlights illuminate the dark highway. 
EXT. COAST OF MAINE - MORNING 
The car is parked, with Homer sleeping in it alone. The sounds of the ocean increase as Homer opens his eyes. Homer gets out of the car and walks toward the beach, enchanted. There it is: his first view ever of an ocean, the horizon, the sun glimmering on the water. Candy is lying on a blanket in the sand. Wally is throwing rocks in the water. Homer takes it all in. When Candy calls for him, Homer walks up to her. 
CANDY I'm a little worried about the... (she gestures below her waist) ...about how much bleeding is okay. 
HOMER It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps? (Candy nods) They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal. 
WALLY (O.S.) Catch! 
A football comes flying through the air toward Homer; it bounces off his chest. Wally laughs. 
WALLY (meaning the football) Give it here! 
Homer throws the football; it's clear he's never thrown one before. 
WALLY What was *that*?! Come over here! 
Homer runs over to Wally, who proceeds to show him how to pass the ball. Snatches of his instruction drift to Candy, who closes her eyes. "Put your fingers on the laces--no, it rests in your palm, like this! You want the laces up--yes, like that!" 
EXT. COAST OF MAINE - DAY (LATER) 
Homer and Wally sit on the beach a short distance from Candy's blanket. She appears to be asleep. Wally looks in her direction before he speaks to Homer. 
WALLY It's called the Burma run. It's about a seven-hour round-trip flight between India and China. 
Wally draws a crude map in the sand. 
HOMER "Burma run" because you fly over Burma... 
WALLY *And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump. 
On Candy's face: she's not asleep; she's listening. 
HOMER (O.S.) At what altitude? 
WALLY I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass. 
Homer looks at Wally, thoughtfully. 
HOMER What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that! 
WALLY (conspiratorially) Actually, I volunteered. 
Homer is shocked; he looks back at Candy, lowers his voice. 
HOMER It's the flying, right? You love to fly, don't you? 
Wally nods; he also gives a look in Candy's direction before he responds. 
WALLY I love the bombing, too. But there's also the Himalayas--they have the most wicked air currents in the world. I wouldn't miss flying there for anything. 
Homer's smile suggests that he's impressed, but that he wouldn't have Wally's enthusiasm for the task. Wally laughs and puts his hand on Homer's shoulder. 
WALLY Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring. 
HOMER Oh, I would love that, Wally. 
EXT. CAPE KENNETH - LOBSTER POUND - AFTERNOON 
The car is parked at a lobster pound. Homer sits in the car watching Wally carrying Candy's bag to the door. Candy stands outside the car; she shakes Homer's hand. 
CANDY I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything. 
HOMER Sure... I'll see you around. 
Candy turns and heads toward the house to catch up with Wally. A lobsterman in his boat is approaching the dock. It's RAY, Candy's father. Candy waves. "Hi, Daddy!" Homer glances at Candy and Wally on the dock, kissing good-bye. 
CANDY (whispering) I love you, Wally. 
WALLY I love you, too. See you tomorrow. 
EXT. OCEAN VIEW - WORTHINGTON HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Wally drives up to the Worthington house; he gets out of the car. Homer sits in the car, admiring the beautiful farmhouse. 
WALLY Come on. You have to meet my mom. (conspiratorially) If it comes up, I've been at a wedding. That's where I met you, at the wedding. 
INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE - WALLY'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
Homer as never seen such a room: the sports trophies, the photos of athletic teams, and of Candy with Wally. Model airplanes are everywhere. Mrs. Worthington's voice comes from the hall. 
OLIVE (O.S.) Wally? I expected you earlier... 
She appears in the doorway of Wally's room. Mrs. Worthington (OLIVE) is an elegant, fiftyish New Englander, as handsome as Wally, but more reserved. She is surprised to see Homer. 
WALLY This is Homer Wells--he's the most overqualified apple picker you'll ever meet, but he's dying to learn the apple business.

{"test1_input": "ZOE We should hit town right during Sunday worship. Won't be any crowds. \nMAL If Fanty and Mingo are right about the payroll, this could look to be a sunny day for us. \nSIMON \n(APPROACHING) Captain, I'll ask you one last time... \nMAL Doctor, I'm taking your sister under my protection here. If anything happens to her, anything at all, I swear to you I will get very choked up. Honestly. There could be tears. He peels out, leaves Simon fuming. Kaylee sidles up to him... \nKAYLEE Don't mind the Captain none, Simon. I know he'll look out for her. \nSIMON It's amazing. I bring River all the way out to the raggedy edge of the 'verse so she can hide from the Alliance by robbing banks. \nKAYLEE It's just a little Trading Station. They'll be back 'fore you can spit. (as he stalks off) Not that you spit... \nKaylee watches him go, a tad forlorn. \nEXT. LILAC - DAY \nWe see the town sprawled before us, as the mule heads in. The town embodies the lives of folk out here: adobe and wood mix with metal and plastic -- whatever's on hand to build with. Right now the streets are mainly empty. \nEXT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING \nThe mule pulls up, Zoe hitching it as they speak: \nJAYNE What are we hoping to find here that equals the worth of a turd? \nMAL Alliance payroll. There's peace enforcing squads stationed all about this quadrant. Can't use credits out here -- they got to pay their boys in cashy money. Which once a month rests here. \nZOE Something about stealing from the Alliance just warms a body like whiskey in winter. \nJAYNE (cocks his gun) Shiny. Let's be badguys. Mal turns back to River. \nMAL You ready to go to work, darlin'? \nRIVER There's no pattern to the pebbles here, they're completely random. I tried to count them but you drove too fast. Hummingbird. \nMAL (never mind) Right. Great. Let's go. \nINT. TRADING STATION - DAY \nWe are in a camera's eye view, right above the door. \nJ \nThe door slams open, Mal and Jayne stride in, Zoe following and whipping her hogleg right at camera without looking. Reverse to see the camera is also a small screen with \"Welcome to Lilac\" on it for the millisecond before it's blown to bits. There's maybe fifteen people in the place: store workers, farm-folk and a couple dirt-poor kids. It's a combination post-office, general store, bank, and most other things. \nMAL Hands and knees and heads bowed down! Everybody, now! Two men who appear to be farm folk rush Mal and the others. Mal draws on the elder one and he stops dead in his tracks. Mal's gun is long, not unlike Civil War era issue, but very much new in design. The other tries to tackle Jayne, which is not necessarily a great idea. Jayne clotheslines him so hard he spins right upside-down -- and Jayne grabs him by the legs and CRACK! -- bounces his head right off the floor, knocking him out cold. \nMAL \n(CONTINUING) Y'all wanna be looking very intently at your own belly buttons. I see a head start to rise, violence is gonna ensue. The guy who rushed Mal complies along with everyone else. Jayne dumps his catch on the floor and rips open his dirty shirt to reveal the purple of an Alliance uniform. \nJAYNE Looks like this is the place. He looks up at Mal, who motions for Zoe to open the front door. She does, and River steps in. ANGLE: RIVER'S BARE FEET -- walking slowly among the hunched- over customers as Mal addresses them. \nMAL You've probably guessed we mean to be thieving here, but what we are after is not yours. So let's have no undue fussing. As he is speaking, Jayne is scrambling to the back office, finding the small vault locked. \nJAYNE She's locked up. River suddenly looks around, perturbed. CLOSE ON: a young tough. River looks up at Zoe, alarmed, and silently points to the young man. He is slowly reaching for the weapon in his belt. He finds Zoe's sawed-off nuzzling his cheek. \nZOE You know what the definition of a hero is? It's someone who gets other people killed. You can look it up later. He drops his weapon, slides it across the floor. Mal moves to the Trade Agent. Hauls him up, tosses him toward the vault. Zoe and Jayne follow. \nTRADE AGENT This is just a crop moon, don't think you'll find what you -- \nMAL (in Chinese) The old man punches in the code. What opens is a tiny wall safe. Bundles of bills, some scattered coin. Unimpressive. Jayne and Zoe are behind the captain, peering in. \nZOE At last. We can retire and give up this life of crime. Mal reaches in, pulls a lever and the floor opens, a six foot hole appearing, stairs leading to a corridor, all gleaming metal and blue light. Zoe smiles. Jayne peers down as Mal addresses the Trade Agent. \nMAL Is there a fed down there? Be truthful. \nTRADE AGENT \n(NODDING) Y'all are Browncoats, hey? Fought for independence? \nVJ \n", "test1_true": "GUARD (O.S.) You have to give me your authorization password! Jayne impatiently fires a burst of machine-gun fire down into the hole. A beat... \nGUARD (O . S . ) \n(CONTINUING) Okay... Mal looks at Zoe and they head down into: \nINT. VAULT - CONTINUING \nWhich is as modern as something off the Central Planets. A short corridor leads to a real vault door, that the guard is already opening. Behind that door, a few bags of the real deal: neatly stacked cash, waiting to be robbed. \nINT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING \nWe move in on River as something crosses her face. Worry. \nEXT. TOWN - DAY \nA WOMAN carrying a bucket and her nine year old SON are looking at the trading station a few buildings away. \nSON Repeater. \nWOMAN Did sound summat like gunblast... Maybe you aught run tell Lawman... She turns and right by her, in the shadows, is a man. Mostly. He is hideously disfigured, a combination of self- mutilation and the bubbling red of radiation poisoning. His clothes are rags, his eyes pinpoints of glazed madness. A blade blurs through frame... \nINT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING \nRiver SCREAMS and flops onto her back, pinned by revelation. Others look at her, concerned, as Jayne makes his way to her. \nJAYNE What the hell is up? You all right? What's goin' on? He holds her, as she whispers, wide-eyed... \nRIVER Reavers. \nINT. VAULT - MOMENTS LATER \nZoe is hauling out the last of five bags as Mal talks to the guard, holding his gun at him: \nMAL Leg's good, it'll bleed plenty and we avoid any necessary organs... \nGUARD I was thinking more of a graze.. \nMAL Well you don't want it to look like you just gave up... \nJAYNE (O.S.) \nMAL! \nMAL (to himself) Every heist, he's gotta start yelling my name -- \nJAYNE (barreling in) Mal! Reavers! The girl's pitchin' a fit. They're here or they're comin' soon. He is already loading up with bags as Mal thinks quickly. \nMAL (to Zoe and Jayne) Get on the mule. (to the guard, pointing to the \nVAULT) Does that open from the inside? \nJ \nGUARD Whah -ah- yes... \nMAL You get everyone upstairs in there and you seal it. Long as you got air you don't open up, you understand? \nGUARD I -- Buh I -- Mal is in his face, dark and huge: \nMAL \nGET THEM INSIDE THE VAULT. \nEXT. TRADING STATION - DAY \nThe doors burst open, Jayne and Zoe coming out first, Mal behind with River in hand. She is freaked, in her own space. Jayne and Zoe throw the bags on -- \nMAL Zoe take the wheel -- \nJAYNE You see 'em? Anybody see 'em? 1J -- and jump on themselves, Mal scanning the area as he hands River up to Jayne's care. As the craft powers up, slowly moving, the young man Zoe kept from trying to pull his weapon bursts out of the station, grabbing the back of the mule. \nYOUNG MAN Take me with you! \n", "test1_id": 3099, "test2_input": "WASH Do we care? Are we caring about that? \nJAYNE You dumbass hogs, the only people she's a threat to is us on this boat! \nINT. STORAGE LOCKER - CONTINUING \nRiver is near the ceiling, keeping herself up in a split again, feet against the walls. There is a wire mesh cover to the light, and she has bent part of it out, is working it inside the lock of her shackles. \nINT. PASSENGER DORM - MOMENTS LATER \nMAL Look, we get back to Haven in a 'r/ few hours time -- \nJAYNE Hiding under the Shepherd's skirts, that's a manful scheme -- \nMAL You wanna run this ship? \nJAYNE Yes! \nMAL (small beat) Well you can't! \nJAYNE Do a damn sight better job'n you. Getting us lashed over a couple of strays... (to Simon) No offense, Doc, I think it's noble as a grape the way you look to River, but she ain't my sister (to Mal) and she ain't your crew. Oh, and neither is she exactly helpless! So where's it writ we gotta lay down our lives for her, which is what you've steered us toward. \nMAL I didn't start this. \nJAYNE No, the Alliance starts the war -- and then you volunteer. Battle of Serenity, Mal: besides Zoe here, how many -- (Mal turns away) -- I'm talkin' at you -- how many men in your platoon came out of there alive? Mal stares at him. \nZOE (dead cold) You wanna leave this room. \nJAYNE You're damn right I do. He stalks upstairs. There's a quiet moment. \nINARA This isn't the war, Mal. Mal turns, eyeing her. \nMAL Are you telling me that because you think I don't know -- \nINARA You came to the training house looking for a fight. \nMAL I came looking for you. \nINARA I just want to know who I'm dealing with. I've seen too many versions of you to be sure. \nMAL I start fighting a war I guarantee you'll see something new. \nTO Mal walks out into the cargo bay, Inara following, over: \nSIMON We'll get off. River and I'll get off at Haven and find some -- \nKAYLEE Nobody's saying that. \nWASH Nobody besides Jayne is saying that. \nINT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING \nInara tries to catch up to -- \nINARA Mal. \nMAL \n(TURNING) I got no answers for you, Inara. I got no rudder. Wind blows 40 northerly, I go north. That's who I am. Maybe that ain't a man to lead but they have to follow so you wanna tear me down do it inside your own mind. \nINARA I'm not trying to tear you down -- \nD \nMAL But you fog things up. You always have -- you spin me about. I wish like hell you was elsewhere. \nINARA I was. \nINT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUING \nJayne is looking at the storage locker door. A beat. \nJAYNE \nHe moves to the aft hall, shuts and locks the door. Goes 40 back to the locker and starts to unlock it, pulling his gun. \n", "test2_true": "(CONTINUING) No trouble now, little crazy person... we're going for a nice \nI shuttle ride -- He opens the door and she is on him in an instant, whip blow to the throat, the nose -- he fires wildly as she jumps on him, wraps her arms around his neck and topples him back -- \nINT. AFT HALL - MOMENTS LATER \nThe crew enters, drawn by the shots. Mal is first -- can't open the door. Looks in to see an unconscious Jayne... \nMAL The other way! Find her and-do not engage! Everyone piles out the other way. Simon remains, to look in the window. \nANGLE: SIMON'S POV: There is Jayne, not moving -- and River pops up right in front of us. He starts, then waits as she opens the door. \nNO \nSIMON It's gonna be oka -- She elbows his throat viciously. He drops to his knees, shocked and gasping, as she spin-kicks him to the ground. He doesn't move. She looks at him a moment, then takes off. \nINT. CARGO BAY - MOMENTS LATER \nMal is throwing his shoulder against the bolted door to the upstairs. He gives up, looking around. \nZOE She's sealed off the bridge. I do not like her there. \nKAYLEE Cap'n! She tosses him a bolt remover. He starts pulling a bolt out of a panel on the wall, tells Zoe: \nMAL Check the shuttles. She coulda 40 snuck in. He pops the panel off and starts wriggling in among the wires. \nINT. FOREDECK HALL/BRIDGE - LATER \nA floor panel hinges open, Mal pulling himself up. He moves quietly to the bridge, gun drawn. He enters to find River frantically punching up coordinates on a big Cortex screen she's pulled out by the copilot's seat. She whips Jayne's gun at his face, never looking at him. A moment, and Mal lowers his own gun. \nMAL The government's man, he says you're a danger to us. Not worth helping. Is he right? Are you anything but a weapon? I've staked my crew's life on the a - person-,-- - actual and whole, and if I'm wrong you'd best shoot me now. (she cocks the gun) Or we could talk more... \nRIVER (pointing to screen) Miranda. WIt's a planet. Matches the one from her dream. \nINT. BRIDGE - LATER \nEveryone has gathered. Wash is piloting now, as they are in atmosphere. River is by Simon. She moves restlessly, upset. \nKAYLEE How can it be there's a whole planet called Miranda and none of us knowed that? \nMAL Because there isn't one. It's a blackrock. Uninhabitable. Terraforming didn't hold, or somesuch. Few settlers died. \nRIVER (to Simon) I had to show them. I didn't know if you were going to make me sleep. \nSIMON (hoarse whisper) You could've asked... \nKAYLEE (re: planet) Wait a tick, yeah! Some ten years back, before the war. There was call for workers to settle on Miranda, my daddy talked about going. I should've recalled... \nWASH But there's nothing about it on the Cortex -- History, Astronomy... it's not in there. \nMAL Half of writing history is hiding the truth. There's something on this rock the Alliance doesn't want known. \nINARA That's right at the edge of the Burnham Quadrant, right? \n(MORE) \nINARA (cont'd) Furthest planet out. (Mal nods) It's not that far from here... \nW \nWASH Whoah, no, no -- \nZOE (moving to the screen) That's a bad notion -- \nWASH Honey... \nZOE I got it, baby. \nWASH Show them the bad... She hits some commands on the screen, pulls back to reveal a couple of other planets near Miranda. \nZOE This is us, see? And here's Miranda. All along here, this dead space in between, that's Reaver territory. \nWASH They just float out there, sending out raiding parties -- \n", "test2_id": 3100, "test3_input": "JAYNE Go! The entire crew piles out, all heavily bedecked with weapons. \nMAL Head inside! \nV0 \nINT. BLACK ROOM/INNER HALL - MOMENTS LATER \nA small double-sized doorway leads to the \"Black Room\", which is the entrance proper to the facility. Mal hits a button and huge, thick, blast doors open from the sides AND the top and bottom, creating the effect of a square hole getting bigger. The hall itself is smaller than the black room, but still has the arrows on the ceiling, that point to an elevator some fifty feet away. \nMAL Come on. Jayne, rearguard. Zoe slows, looking around her. \nZOE Sir. (he turns to her) This is a good hold point_ \nMAL We all stay together -- \nZOE No. They have to come through here; they'll bottleneck and we can thin 'em out. We get pushed ,oO back there's the blast doors. \nKAYLEE I can rig 'em so they won't re- open once they close. \nMAL Then shut 'em and hide til -- \nZOE We need to draw them til it's done. This is the place. We'll buy you the time. \nJAYNE (to the others) Move those crates back there for cover -- and make sure they ain't filled with anything goes boom. \nKAYLEE Wait, Wash -- where's Wash? Nobody (but River) realized he wasn't there. Zoe is dead calm. ,No ZOE He ain't comin'. Everybody takes that in, Kaylee's eyes welling up. \nJAYNE Move the gorram crates! Come on! We hear savage SCREAMS from the hanger -- they're approaching. Mal moves to the door, Jayne beside him. \nANGLE: HIS POV Reavers rush toward them. He turns to Jayne. \nMAL Tell me you brought 'em this time... Jayne smiles grimly, tosses Mal a grenade as he pops his own and fastballs it at the Reavers. \nJ \nIt explodes in their midst, smoke and man-parts flying about. Mal rolls his a shorter distance, then slams the door shut. \nANGLE: THE GRENADE \nExplodes, raining a bunch of equipment -- and part of a catwalk -- right in front of the door. In the black room, the door nearly buckles from the explosion. Everyone takes positions behind the crates. Zoe stands calmly, her back to the door, loading her sawed-off. \nMAL (continuing; moving back to Zoe) Zoe... are you here? She looks up at him. \nZOE Do the job, sir. \nMAL You hold. Hold till I'm back. He takes off -- passes Inara, the two of them holding a look for as long as they can. Then he's in the elevator and gone. Jayne moves over to Zoe. \nJAYNE Captain's right. Can't be thinking on revenge if we're gonna get through this. \nZOE You really think any of us are gonna get through this? He looks back at their army: A companion, a doctor, a mechanic and a more-than-usually out of it River. A beat, and he looks back at Zoe with forlorn hope: \nJAYNE I might... \nINT. MR UNIVERSE'S HQ - MOMENTS LATER \nThe elevator stops and Mal makes his way to the island of screens and machines in the center of the space. The first thing he takes in is that every broadwave port has been destroyed. The second: \nANGLE: MR UNIVERSE is lying dead, eyes open, half draped on his equally still lovebot. A trail of blood shows he crawled from his chair. \nV0 Mal comes close. Nothing. He starts to move away again and the lovebot turns her head, her eyes focusing with an audible whir. She speaks with surprisingly realistic expressiveness, and a warped, computery version of Mr Universe's voice. \nLOVEBOT Mal. Mal stops. \nLOVEBOT \n(CONTINUING) Guy killed me, Mal. He killed me with a sword. How weird is that? I got... a short span here... they destroyed my equipment but I have a back-up unit... bottom of the complex, right over the generator. Hard to get to. I know they missed it. They can't stop the signal, Mal. They can never stop the signal. \n(BEAT) Okay this is painful. On many levels. I'm not -- \nA0 She turns back, powering down. Recording over. A beat, and Mal takes off. \nINT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING \nInara is on her knees, unwrapping the oilcloth we saw in her shuttle. River is in the corner, clutching her head. \n", "test3_true": "SIMON It's okay... - \nRIVER They're all made up of rage. I can't... A BANG as a body slams against the door. \nSIMON Just stay low. I'm right here. \nJayne moves past them to Zoe, takes position by her. \nJAYNE She picked a sweet bung of a time to go helpless on us. \nZOE (calls out) Jayne and I take the first wave. Nobody shoots less they get past our fire. Simon moves to Kaylee, who is shaky as hell. The bangs on the door continue. \nKAYLEE Oh, I didn't plan on going out like this. I think we did right, but... \nSIMON I never planned... anything. I just wanted to keep River safe. Spent so much time on Serenity trying to find us a home I never realized I already had. She looks at him with soft surprise. \nSIMON \n(CONTINUING) My one true regret in all this is never being with you. \nKAYLEE With me? You mean to say, as, sex? \nSIMON \n(SMILES) I mean to say. Kaylee snaps her cartridge home with way more precision than we might expect from her, takes steady aim at the door. \nKAYLEE Hell with this. I'm gonna live. Simon looks at her a moment, then turns his attention to the door. Inara come up into frame with the contents of the oilcloth: a bow and arrow, which she pulls back with focused grace. ANGLE: THE DOOR starts to come off its hinges. \nINT. MR UNIVERSE'S HQ - CONTINUING \nA panel is kicked in from the ceiling and the Operative drops down, having clearly entered from a different location. He looks around, carrying a laser-pistol. He moves past Mr Universe and Lenore -- \nLOVEBOT \nMAL (The Operative turns) Guy killed me, Mal. \nINT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING \nMal has reached it and surveys the situation. Before him is a railing, and he can look down on the generator shaft. It's miles deep, with machines rotating and grinding, and arcs of electricity ricochetting around it. On the other side is a platform, with the broadwave console sitting behind a clear plastic partition. Cables and chains run along the ceiling, around a series of ladder rungs. \nMAL Hard to get to. That's a fact. \nINT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING \nlw\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd The door is pried partially open -- enough for one Reaver to squeeze through and charge. Zoe stands up and shoots him in the head. He arcs back hard as the second comes, Zoe shoots him, calmly walking toward the door -- \nJAYNE Zoe... Gorramnit... But she is in a trance, and we see beneath the calm, to the bubbling magma of rage that keeps her firing, single shots, each one a kill, till five men down and she's out of ammo. The sixth comes at her swinging a blade and she blocks, the precision of military training still in her as she flips him, wresting the blade free and swinging it down out of frame, bringing it up bloody, swinging again as the door bursts open and she's rushed from behind --- But Jayne totes an automatic, sprays killing fire on the lot, moving forward himself -- \nJ \nJAYNE \n(CONTINUING) ZOE! Get yer ass back in the line! vo\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd She looks up, almost confused -- and one of Jayne's targets comes back off the ground and slices at her back with a blade, she screams as he cuts deep -- and an arrow lodges in his neck. Inara pulls up a fresh arrow, shaking only slightly. \nINT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - LATER \nMal is on the railing, reaching for the 'rungs' on the ceiling just above him. He can almost get them -- one wrong move and he pitches into the jaws of death... A laser shot nails him in the lower back -- he arches, legs sliding off the rail -- he falls and hits the rail with the backs of his legs, flipping painfully onto his face as he falls, mercifully, back onto the platform. The Operative comes around some equipment for a closer shot as Mal gets shakily up. \nMAL (in pain) Shot me in the back. I haven't... made you angry, have I? I s \nTHE OPERATIVE There's a lot of innocent people in the air being killed right now. \nMAL You have no idea how true that is. There's no wise-ass attitude in him now. They stand, facing off at ten paces. \nMAL \n(CONTINUING) I know the secret now. The truth that burned up River Tam's brain and set you after her. And the rest of the 'verse is gonna know it too. 'Cause they need to. \nTHE OPERATIVE You really believe that? \nMAL I do. \nTHE OPERATIVE You willing to die for that belief? \n", "test3_id": 3101}

{"train": "SERENITY \nWritten by \nJoss Whedon \nApril 18, 2004 \nEXT. CLASSROOM - DAY \nIt's a group of twelve-year-olds, serious and well dressed. They sit on their heels under a sparsely elegant tent, small wooden desks with embedded screens in front of them. The tent is on a lawn surrounded by lush foliage. People walk about and vehicles glide quietly overhead. A utopian vista. \nGIRL Now that the war's over, our soldiers get to come home, yes? \nTEACHER Some of them. Some will be stationed on the rim planets as Peace Enforcers. \nBOY I don't understand. Why were the Independents even fighting us? Why wouldn't they look to be more civilized? \nTEACHER That's a good question. Does anybody want to open on that? \nGIRL I hear they're cannibals. \nANOTHER BOY That's only Reavers. \nANOTHER GIRL Reavers aren't real. \nANOTHER BOY Full well they are. They attack settlers from space, they kill them and wear their skins and rape them for hours and hours -- \nTEACHER (in Chinese) \n(CALMER) It's true that there are... dangers on the outer planets. So let's follow up on Borodin's question. With all the social and medical advancements we can bring to the Independents, why would they fight so hard against us? \nRIVER We meddle. \nTEACHER River? RIVER is a dark, intense little girl, writing with one hand and \"typing\" with the other. (Typing consists of holding a long wooden stylus and tapping either end down different columns of chinese characters on her desktop screen.) She is a good two years younger than the other kids. \nRIVER People don't like to be meddled with. We tell them what to do, what to think, don't run don't walk we're in their homes and in their heads and we haven't the right. We're meddlesome. \nTEACHER (gently taking her \nSTYLUS) River, we're not telling people what to think. We're just trying to show them how. She violently PLUNGES the stylus into the girl's forehead \nINT. LAB - NIGHT \nAnd we FLASH CUT to the actual present: a 16 year old RIVER sitting in a metal chair, needles stuck in her skull (one right where the teacher had stuck her) being adjusted by a technician. A second monitors her brain patterns. The lab is cold, blue, steel. Insidiously clean. \n2ND TECHNICIAN She's dreaming. \nFIRST TECHNICIAN Nightmare? \n2ND TECHNICIAN Off the charts. Scary monsters. \nDOCTOR MATHIAS Let's amp it up. Delcium, eight- drop. DOCTOR MATHIAS is not instantly likable -- nor gradually, for that matter. A cold man, and more than a little satisfied with himself. \nBehind him stands a GOVERNMENT INSPECTOR, observing. And making him a little nervous. The Inspector is in shadow, but his uniform indicates -- no substantial rank, as does the eagle-crested baton longer than a ruler -- that he clutches in one gloved hand. \nDOCTOR MATHIAS \n(CONTINUING) See, most of our best work is done when they're asleep. We can monitor and direct their subconscious, implant suggestions... River starts convulsing, mewing in misery. The Inspector starts forward, slowly. \nDOCTOR MATHIAS \n(CONTINUING) It's a little startling to see, but the results are spectacular. Especially in this case. River Tam is our star pupil. The Inspector steps into the light. He is rigid, cold, staring at the girl with no emotion at all. His name, as we will very soon learn, is SIMON. \nSIMON I've heard that. \nDOCTOR MATHIAS She's a genius. Her mental capacity is extraordinary, even with the side-effects. \nSIMON Tell me about them. \nDOCTOR MATHIAS Well, obviously, she's unstable... the neural stripping gives them heightened cognitive reception, but it also destabilizes their own reality matrix. It manifests as borderline schizophrenia... which at this point is the price for being truly psychic. \nSIMON (moves toward her) What use do we have for a psychic if she's insane? \nJ \n(CONTINUING) Remarkable children. Doctor Mathias storms in, two security men (not the ones from the opening) and a nervous young female intern following. Mathias looks greyer and more gaunt than when we saw him last. \nDOCTOR MATHIAS Excuse me! No one is allowed in the records room without my express permission. \nTHE OPERATIVE (over this, quietly) Enter the doctor. (to Mathias) Forgive me. I prefer to see the event alone, without bias. Mathias looks at the hologram -- realizes which one it is. \nDOCTOR MATHIAS I need to see your clearance. \nTHE OPERATIVE You're right to insist. I know you've had security issues here. He places his hand on a screen as he says it. Mathias looks at the readout, and drops the bluster. \nDOCTOR MATHIAS Apologies. An Operative of the Parliament will of course have full cooperation. (looks at screen) I'm not sure what... I see no listing of rank, or name. \nTHE OPERATIVE I have neither. Like this facility, I don't exist. The Parliament calls me in when... when they wish they didn't have to. Let's talk about the Tams. \nDOCTOR MATHIAS I assume you've scanned the status logs... \nVJ \nTHE OPERATIVE River was your greatest success. A prodigy -- A phenomenon. Until her brother walked in eight months ago and took her from you. \nDOCTOR MATHIAS It's not quite so simple. \nTHE OPERATIVE I'm very aware of that. \nDOCTOR MATHIAS He came in with full creds. He beat the ap-scan, the retinal... There was no way I could -- \nTHE OPERATIVE No, no. Of course. The boy spent his fortune developing the contacts to infiltrate this place. \nDOCTOR MATHIAS Gave up a brilliant future in. medicine as well, you've probably read. Turned his back on his whole life. Madness. \nTHE OPERATIVE Madness, no. Something a good deal more dangerous. Have you looked at this scan carefully? At his face? Mathias looks uncertain. \nTHE OPERATIVE \n(CONTINUING) It's love, in point of fact. He loved his sister and he knew she was in pain. So he took her somewhere safe. \nDOCTOR MATHIAS Why are you here? \nTHE OPERATIVE I'm here because the situation is even less simple than you think. (eyeing him) Do you know what your sin is, Doctor? \nJ \nDOCTOR MATHIAS I. I would be very careful about what you -- \nTHE OPERATIVE \n(SADLY) It's pride. He touches the computer screen and the hologramic image jumps to the Doctor and Simon in the lab, Mathias repeating: \nDOCTOR MATHIAS Key members of Parliament have personally observed this subject. I was told their support -- \nTHE OPERATIVE (shutting it off) Key members of Parliament. Key. The minds behind every diplomatic, military and covert operation in the galaxy, and you put them in a room with a psychic. \nDOCTOR MATHIAS She was... she read cards, nothing more. \nTHE OPERATIVE It's come to our attention that River became much more unstable, more... disturbed, after you showed her off to Parliament. Did she see something very terrible in those cards? \nDOCTOR MATHIAS Whatever... secrets she might have accidentally gleaned... it's probable she doesn't even know she knows them. That they're buried beneath -- \nTHE OPERATIVE But they are in her. Her mind is unquiet. It's the will of the Parliament that I kill her. And the brother. Because of your sin. \nJ \nTHE OPERATIVE (continuing; moving to his briefcase) You know, in certain older civilized cultures, when men failed as entirely as you have, they would throw themselves on their swords. \nDOCTOR MATHIAS (fed up) Well, unfortunately I forgot to bring a sword to -- The air rings crisply as the Operative pulls out his sword. \nTHE OPERATIVE The Parliament has no further interest in psychics. They represent a threat to the harmony and stability of our Alliance. \nDOCTOR MATHIAS I would put that down right now if I were you. \nTHE OPERATIVE Would you be killed in your sleep, like an ailing pet? Whatever your failings, I believe you deserve better than that. The agents move. He slices the throat of the one behind him with true grace, thrusting at the second as he's pulling out his gun and pinning his hand. A moment, and the dying agent reflexively squeezes the trigger, shooting his own arm. The Operative pulls out the sword and the agent falls as quietly as the first. Mathias bolts but the Operative pins him to the wall. He bunches his fingers and jabs the side of the Doctor's spine. Mathias stiffens, suddenly, agonizingly immobile. The Operative steps back, observes the Doctor's rigid grimace for a moment. Almost ceremoniously, he drops to one knee and holds the blade out to one side, hilt to the floor and point tilted toward the doctor. The Doctor stares at it in horror as his paralyzed body begins to tip over toward it. The Operative turns toward the terrified intern at the door. \nV0 \nTHE OPERATIVE \nJAYNE Well, what you plan and what takes place ain't ever exactly been similar. \nMAL No grenades. (Jayne groans) No grenades. First Mate ZOE enters from the lower level. Her mode of dress and military deference mark her as a war buddy of Mal's. \nZOE Are we crashing again? \nMAL Talk to your husband. Is the mule prepped? \nZOE Good to go, sir. Just loading her up. (to Jayne) Are those grenades? \nJAYNE Cap'n doesn't want 'em. \nJ \nZOE We're robbing the place. We're not occupying it. All that plays in the background as we lead Mal into the: \nINT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUING \nIt's the communal space of the ship, homey and messy. There is food left lying on the table. Mal swipes a dumpling from a plate, pops it in his mouth as another jolt rocks him and sends most of the tableware clattering to the floor. \nMAL (calling out) Kaylee! He enters: \nINT. AFT HALL/ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUING \nMAL (still calling) Kaylee, what in the sphincter of hell are you playing at? The hall leads to the rust-brown chaos that is the engine room. Working around the engine in a forest of wires, sparks and smoke is the sweetly pretty mechanic, KAYLEE. She passes Mal with a slightly impatient smile as he stands in the doorway, raising his voice above the din. \nMAL \n(CONTINUING) We got the Primary Buffer \nKAYLEE Everything's shiny, Cap'n. Not to fret. \nMAL You told me -- \n(JOLT) You told me the entry couplings would hold for another week! \nKAYLEE \n(WORKING) That was six months ago, cap'n. \nMAL My ship don't crash. If she crashes, you crashed her. \nSteam and electricity shoot at him, backing him up. He turns to see Simon behind him. Simon is more seasoned than before, but still contrasts the Captain entirely in dress and manner. He is implacably proper. Also pissed. \nMAL \n(CONTINUING) Doctor. Guess I need to get innocked 'fore we hit planetside. Simon nods, the ship jolting again. \nMAL \n(CONTINUING) Bit of a rockety ride. Nothing to worry about. \nSIMON I'm not worried. \nMAL Fear is nothing to be ashamed of, Doc. \nSIMON This isn't fear. This is anger. \nMAL \n4 (LAUGHS) Well, it's kinda hard to tell the one from t'other, face like yours. \nSIMON I imagine if it were fear, my eyes would be wider. \nMAL I'll look for that next time. \nSIMON You're not taking her. \nMAL (brushing past him) No no, that's not a thing I'm interested in talking over with -- \nSIMON She's not going with you. That's final. \nMAL (turning back) I hear the words \"that's final\" come out of your mouth ever again, they truly will be. (turning away again) This is my boat. Y'all are guests on it. He heads down a side corridor that has steps leading down to: \nINT. PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING \nZOE We should hit town right during Sunday worship. Won't be any crowds. \nMAL If Fanty and Mingo are right about the payroll, this could look to be a sunny day for us. \nSIMON \n(APPROACHING) Captain, I'll ask you one last time... \nMAL Doctor, I'm taking your sister under my protection here. If anything happens to her, anything at all, I swear to you I will get very choked up. Honestly. There could be tears. He peels out, leaves Simon fuming. Kaylee sidles up to him... \nKAYLEE Don't mind the Captain none, Simon. I know he'll look out for her. \nSIMON It's amazing. I bring River all the way out to the raggedy edge of the 'verse so she can hide from the Alliance by robbing banks. \nKAYLEE It's just a little Trading Station. They'll be back 'fore you can spit. (as he stalks off) Not that you spit... \nKaylee watches him go, a tad forlorn. \nEXT. LILAC - DAY \nWe see the town sprawled before us, as the mule heads in. The town embodies the lives of folk out here: adobe and wood mix with metal and plastic -- whatever's on hand to build with. Right now the streets are mainly empty. \nEXT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING \nThe mule pulls up, Zoe hitching it as they speak: \nJAYNE What are we hoping to find here that equals the worth of a turd? \nMAL Alliance payroll. There's peace enforcing squads stationed all about this quadrant. Can't use credits out here -- they got to pay their boys in cashy money. Which once a month rests here. \nZOE Something about stealing from the Alliance just warms a body like whiskey in winter. \nJAYNE (cocks his gun) Shiny. Let's be badguys. Mal turns back to River. \nMAL You ready to go to work, darlin'? \nRIVER There's no pattern to the pebbles here, they're completely random. I tried to count them but you drove too fast. Hummingbird. \nMAL (never mind) Right. Great. Let's go. \nINT. TRADING STATION - DAY \nWe are in a camera's eye view, right above the door. \nJ \nThe door slams open, Mal and Jayne stride in, Zoe following and whipping her hogleg right at camera without looking. Reverse to see the camera is also a small screen with \"Welcome to Lilac\" on it for the millisecond before it's blown to bits. There's maybe fifteen people in the place: store workers, farm-folk and a couple dirt-poor kids. It's a combination post-office, general store, bank, and most other things. \nMAL Hands and knees and heads bowed down! Everybody, now! Two men who appear to be farm folk rush Mal and the others. Mal draws on the elder one and he stops dead in his tracks. Mal's gun is long, not unlike Civil War era issue, but very much new in design. The other tries to tackle Jayne, which is not necessarily a great idea. Jayne clotheslines him so hard he spins right upside-down -- and Jayne grabs him by the legs and CRACK! -- bounces his head right off the floor, knocking him out cold. \nMAL \n(CONTINUING) Y'all wanna be looking very intently at your own belly buttons. I see a head start to rise, violence is gonna ensue. The guy who rushed Mal complies along with everyone else. Jayne dumps his catch on the floor and rips open his dirty shirt to reveal the purple of an Alliance uniform. \nJAYNE Looks like this is the place. He looks up at Mal, who motions for Zoe to open the front door. She does, and River steps in. ANGLE: RIVER'S BARE FEET -- walking slowly among the hunched- over customers as Mal addresses them. \nMAL You've probably guessed we mean to be thieving here, but what we are after is not yours. So let's have no undue fussing. As he is speaking, Jayne is scrambling to the back office, finding the small vault locked. \nJAYNE She's locked up. River suddenly looks around, perturbed. CLOSE ON: a young tough. River looks up at Zoe, alarmed, and silently points to the young man. He is slowly reaching for the weapon in his belt. He finds Zoe's sawed-off nuzzling his cheek. \nZOE You know what the definition of a hero is? It's someone who gets other people killed. You can look it up later. He drops his weapon, slides it across the floor. Mal moves to the Trade Agent. Hauls him up, tosses him toward the vault. Zoe and Jayne follow. \nTRADE AGENT This is just a crop moon, don't think you'll find what you -- \nMAL (in Chinese) The old man punches in the code. What opens is a tiny wall safe. Bundles of bills, some scattered coin. Unimpressive. Jayne and Zoe are behind the captain, peering in. \nZOE At last. We can retire and give up this life of crime. Mal reaches in, pulls a lever and the floor opens, a six foot hole appearing, stairs leading to a corridor, all gleaming metal and blue light. Zoe smiles. Jayne peers down as Mal addresses the Trade Agent. \nMAL Is there a fed down there? Be truthful. \nTRADE AGENT \n(NODDING) Y'all are Browncoats, hey? Fought for independence? \nVJ \nMAL Get in the vault with the others -- \nYOUNG MAN I can't stay here! Please! \nMAL It's too many. Drive, Zoe. A Reaver craft ROARS over their heads. It's nearly the size of Serenity. Torn apart, belching smoke -- a welded conglomeration of ruined ships, painted for war. Predator, pure. It disappears over the rooftops. \nYOUNG MAN \nPLEASE! \nMAL Drive! Zoe's face is set with unhappy determination as she floors it, shooting out and leaving the young man in the dust. As they move from him, four Reavers jump out of the shadows and grab the young man. Mal unhesitatingly draws his gun. He nudges a lever with his thumb and a cartridge pops back. Mal fires twice. The young man takes both bullets in the chest, slumps down dead. \nANGLE: THE EDGE OF TOWN As the mule shoots past the last building, we see a skiff shoot out from behind the buildings of the adjacent street, right abreast of our gang. \nANGLE: THE CENTER OF TOWN We see the church as the first ship and an even larger one come to hover over it, Reavers dropping down on cable lines to swarm into it. \nEXT. DESERT - CONTINUING \nThe mule and the skiff are booking through the rocky terrain. The skiff swings closer, but Jayne peppers it with automatic fire and it swings away. There is sporadic return fire. \nJAYNE How come they ain't blowing us out of the air? \nMAL They wanna run us down. The up- close kill. River is squashed down on her back, being very small. \nRIVER They want us alive when they eat us. \nJAYNE Boy, sure would be nice if we had some grenades, don'tchya think? Mal says nothing, keeps firing. \nZOE Wash, baby can you hear me? \nVO \nINT. SERENITY: BRIDGE - CONTINUING \nWash is in a frenzy of switchflipping, prepping for take-off. \nWASH We're moments from air. You got somebody behind you? We intercut Wash and Zoe at this point: \nEXT. DESERT - CONTINUING \nZOE Reavers. \nWASH \n(BLANCHING) \nZOE We're not gonna reach you in time. \nWASH Just keep moving, honey. We're coming to you. \nEXT. SERENITY - CONTINUING \nAs she lifts off and starts heading toward the others. \nEXT. DESERT - CONTINUING \nZoe gets the mule in front but a harpoon thwinngs through the air from the skiff and S} NK! Goes through Jayne's leg.. The harpoon grips the leg and pulls -- Jayne goes flying off the back of the Mule, Mal just grabbing him as the harpoon line reels slowly tighter -- \nMAL Grab on! Jayne grabs the Mule, legs dangling, pulled out between the two vessels as Mal slams a new cartridge into his pistol. \nJAYNE I won't get et! You shoot me if they take me! Mal steadies himself and takes aim, seemingly at Jayne -- \nJAYNE \n(CONTINUING) Well don't shoot me first! \nJ \nMal fires. Again. Steadies himself for one more... The line holding the harpoon is split by Mal's third shot. \nV0V The mule surges forward as Jayne drags on the ground. Mal hauls him in as River bounds into the front to make room. \nJAYNE \n(CONTINUING) Rutting pigs! Where's -- And River is holding out his weapon before he can ask for it. \n(BRIDLING) I left because -- go away. We're no longer friends. You're a stranger to me now. \nSHEYDRA 104 I do love to watch you boil. Don't worry. The stories will fade. And your Captain Reynolds has probably gotten himself blown up by this time. \nINARA (looking away again) Yes. That would be just like him. \nEXT. BEAUMONDE: ATOLL PLAZA - EVENING \nSerenity touches down on the crowded atoll amidst a number of other, equally disreputable ships. The place is filled with every kind of immigrant culture and shop imaginable. \nEXT./INT. SERENITY - EVENING \nThe ramp is open and everyone is filing out, ready to hit the town. Kaylee is talking to Simon, who has River in hand. \nKAYLEE Don't talk to the barkers -- only the captains. \n(MORE) \nKAYLEE (cont'd) You look the captain in the eye, know who you're dealing with. \n40 SIMON \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 I wish there was... Since he doesn't know what to say, she rattles on: \nKAYLEE You shouldn't aughta be so clean. It's a dead giveaway you don't belong, you always gotta be tidy. Don't pay anybody in advance. And don't ride in anything with a Capissen 38 engine, they fall right out of the sky. \nSIMON Kaylee. She turns and heads off. Simon starts in the other direction, but River looks after her and the others. \nSIMON \n(CONTINUING) River... do you want to stay with them? \n4 RIVER It's not safe. \nSIMON No, I fear it's not safe anymore. He's heading off and doesn't hear: \nRIVER For them. \nINT. THE MAIDENHEAD - CONTINUING \nWe start on a CorVue screen, showing a news report. On the screen is a shot of the town our gang robbed, now half of it a smoking ruin. \nNEWSPERSON (V.O.) that it was a band of Reavers remains unconfirmed. The only survivors of the massacre apparently locked themselves in the Trade Station vault until -- \nDuring this we come around to see that the screen has a blinking light behind it, come THROUGH the wiring of the back to look out at the bar, with the word \"recording\" in the corner. Every screen is a camera, even down here. \nWe pick up Mal and Kaylee heading down into the bar. Cutting away from the camera's view, we can looks two stories straight down as they go, to a close group of dark tables and booths and a second screen playing in the corner. \nMAL It's not my fault the Doc's got no stomach for Rim living -- \nKAYLEE It is entirely and for all your fault! If you'd given Simon a moment, just a moment where he didn't think you were gonna throw them off or turn them in, he might've -- \nMAL What? Swept you into his cleanly arms? Made tidy love to you? They have reached the guncheck, where Jayne and Wash have already checked their guns. It works like a lunch automat: Mal sticks his gun in a drawer, pulls out a chit -- the q0 drawer closes and rotates, revealing another empty one. A large bouncer with a shockrod watches impassively. \nKAYLEE (as they continue \nDOWN) Don't you dare joke! You know how much I pined on Simon. And him fair sweet on me, I well believe, but he's so worried about being found out -- \nZOE Captain didn't make 'em fugitives. \nKAYLEE But he coulda made 'em family! Steada driving them off. Steada keeping Simon from seein' I was there, when I carried such a torch and we coulda -- goin' on a year now I ain't had nothin' twixt my nethers weren't run on batteries! \nMAL Oh god! I can't know that! \nJAYNE 40 I could stand to hear a little more... \nKAYLEE If you had a care for anybody's heart you woulda -- \nMAL \n(ENOUGH) You knew he was gonna leave. We never been but a way station to those two. And how do you know what he feels? He's got River to worry on but he still coulda shown you... if I truly wanted someone bad enough, wouldn't be a thing in the 'verse could stop me from going to her. \nKAYLEE Tell that to Inara. For a moment, Mal is too shocked to react. Kaylee storms out. \nMINGO 4 Domestic troubles? MINGO is young, tough -- somewhere between a gangster and a fur-trader. Sounds lower-class British, or something like it. \nFANTY Domestic troubles? FANTY moves out from behind Mingo to reveal that he is Mingo's identical twin. Apart from slight differences in dress, they are indistinguishable. \nJAYNE \n(CONTINUING) Gorrammit, girl, it's me! She grabs his crotch and squeezes -- his grip loosens and she spins, facing him, and flat-heels his nose with her palm, V0 twirling into a gut kick that doubles him over, dispatching of another while she cracks Jayne's head with a small table -- Somebody pulls a gun and she snaps his elbow, causing him to scream out even before he shoots himself in the gut -- Mal frantically wrests a gun from the vending locker as River knocks the other guy's gun in the air, kicks someone else and then catches it, whips it around just as Mal comes up with his, they are pointed right at each other -- \nSIMON Eta Kooram Nah Smech! And River drops to the ground, fast asleep. There is a beat. Mal looks around the bar. He and Simon, who has run up to the entrance, are the only ones standing. He looks down at River. She lies unconscious, helpless. \nMAL I think maybe we ought to leave. \nEXT. SPACE - NIGHT \nWe see two sleek warships glide silently into frame, followed by a third, bigger ship. This is the operative's vessel, and 10 it is everything Serenity is not: sleek, predatory, icy cool. \nINT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - BRIDGE - CONTINUING \nThe operative is looking at the Maidenhead security feed -- and River is staring right at him. \nTHE OPERATIVE \n(CAPTIVATED) Hello again. Yes, it's me. I'm glad you've finally asked for me. An Ensign is revealed looking at a separate monitor: \nENSIGN We got a pos on a retinal -- man carrying her out is Malcolm Reynolds, captains a Firefly-class transport ship, \"Serenity\". Bound by law five times, smuggling, tariff dodge... not convicted. Nothing here that would -- \nTHE OPERATIVE The ship. The name of the ship. \n10 (SOFTLY) Crossref. Malcolm Reynolds. Serenity. He looks over at the Ensign with a small, strange smile on his lips -- as his glasses are covered by text. \nENSIGN Sir? \nTHE OPERATIVE Serenity Valley. Bloodiest battle of the entire war. The Independents held the valley for seven weeks, two of them after their high command had surrendered. 68% casualty rate. \nENSIGN Of course, Sir, I just didn't -- \nTHE OPERATIVE There. \nHis glasses stop scrolling and Mal's military file opens, a picture of Mal in one lens. \nTHE OPERATIVE \n140 (CONTINUING) If the feds ever bothered to crossref justice files with war records... Yes. Our Mr. Reynolds was a sergeant, 57th Overlanders. Volunteer. Fought at Serenity till the very last. This man is an issue. This man hates us. \nENSIGN First Mate Zoe Washburn, formerly Corporal Zoe Alleyne, also in the 57th. Career army, looks like. \nTHE OPERATIVE She's followed him far... Give me the crew, registered passengers -- Our Captain is a passionate man, no room there for subtlety. He's bound to have some very obvious... CLOSE ON: THE LENS of his glasses. On it is a slowly moving picture of INARA. \nTHE OPERATIVE -40 (continuing) .weakness... \nINT. STORAGE LOCKER - NIGHT \nRiver is still asleep, Mal finishing chaining her wrists. She lies on her side, breathing evenly. Mal stares at her a moment, then: \nINT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUING \nHe exits to find the whole group waiting for him, sans Wash. \nSIMON May I see her? \nMAL She's still napping just now. And I believe you've got some storytelling to do. \nWASH \n(ENTERING) We're out of atmo, plotted for Haven. No one following as of yet. \nKAYLEE Haven? We're gonna see Shepherd Book? \nMAL \n(NODDING) We got to lay low. And I could fair use some spiritual guidance right about now. (to Simon) I am a lost lamb; what in hell happened back there? \nWASH Start with the part where Jayne gets knocked out by a ninety pound girl. 'Cause I don't think that's ever getting old. \nZOE Do we know if anyone was killed? \nMAL It's likely. I know she meant to Ad kill me 'fore the Doc put her to sleep, which how exactly does that work anyhow? \nSIMON Safeword. \nINT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING \nA0 As he watches the security feed of River's fight his image becomes a vidscreen. He's addressing Wash, Mal and Zoe. We intercut between the two spaces: \nMR UNIVERSE Oh, this is good. This is... \n(GIGGLES) .she's beating up all the burly men and I'm having a catharsis, it's happening right now, you guys always bring me the very best violence. You think you're in a hot place? \nWASH That's what we're looking to learn. Is there any follow up, a newswave... \nMR UNIVERSE There is no \"news\", there's the truth of the signal, what I see, and there's the puppet theatre the V0 Parliament's jesters foist on the somnambulant public. Monkey taught to say the word \"monkey\" -- lead story on 32 planets. But the slum riots on Hera, not a -- \nMAL What about this? Did this make the... puppet theatre? \nMR UNIVERSE No sir. And no lawforce flags, either -- I hadda go into the security feed direct... \nMAL You can do that? \nMR UNIVERSE Can't stop the signal, Mal. Everything goes somewhere and I go everywhere. Security feeds are a traipse to access -- and I wasn't the first one in, this has prints on it -- oh! Look at her go! A0 Everyone is getting bruises and contusions. Contoooosions. \nZOE (to Mal, over that) So somebody else has been fed this. That doesn't like me too well. \nMR UNIVERSE Zoe, you sultry minx, stop falling in love with me. You're just gonna embarrass yourself. I have a commitment to my Lovebot, it was a very beautiful ceremony, Lenore wrote her own vows, I cried like a baby, a hungry, angry baby. (re: screen) And she falls asleep. Which, she would be sleepy. \nJ \nMAL Can you go back? See if anybody spoke with her 'fore she acted up, -40 made any kind of contact with her... Mr Universe works the screen. The image rewinds and stops on River coming up to it, looking at it. She whispers the word, \"Miranda\", and starts to move away. \nMAL \n(CONTINUING) Miranda...? Go back further. \nMR UNIVERSE No.. He pulls another screen close, starts working that one. Matching timecodes, he pulls up the commercial. \nMAL Um... please? Mr Universe has a third screen showing the commercial as \n(NON-MATRIXY) well -- and it starts breaking down, bursts of code showing through. As he does so: \nMR UNIVERSE Friends and potential lovers, I \n4DO have good news and I have the other kind. Good is you're very smart. Someone is talking to her. \nWASH The oaty bar? \nMAL Subliminal. It's a subliminal message broadwaved to trigger her. \nMR UNIVERSE \n(NODDING) I been seeing this code pop up all over, last few weeks. And I cannot crack it. It's Alliance and it's high military, so here then is the bad. Someone has gone to enormous trouble to find your little friend. And found her they have. Mal, Zoe and Wash look at each other. \nMR UNIVERSE \n(CONTINUING) Do you all know what it is you're carrying? \nW \nINT. STORAGE LOCKER - NIGHT \nRiver stares at us, impassive, as the camera pulls away from her to reveal Simon, who is cleaning blood off her face. \nRIVER They're afraid of me. \nSIMON I'm sorry... \nRIVER They should be. What I will show them... Oh God... She starts tearing up, breathing faster... Simon runs his hands through her hair. \nSIMON It's okay, it's okay... \nRIVER (somewhere else) Show me off like a dog, old men covered in blood, it never touched them but they're drowning in it... so much loss... I don't know what I'm saying. I never know what I'm saying... \nSIMON You said something. When you were triggered, do you remember? The Captain saw you say something on the feed... \nRIVER Miranda. \nSIMON Miranda. \nMAL Weren't River that did it, you know that. Somebody decided her brain was just another piece of property to take, fenced it right Vd up. \nBOOK You got a plan? \nMAL Hiding ain't a plan? \nBOOK It'll do you for a spell, and the folks here'll be glad of the extra coin... \nMAL .but they'll be coming. Alliance is after this girl with a powerful will. I look to hear the tromp of their boots any moment. \nV0 \nBOOK You won't. (off Mal's look) This isn't a palms-up military MW run, Mal. No reports broadwaved, no warrants... much as they want her, they want her hid. That means Closed File. Means an Operative, which is trouble you've not known. \nMAL I coulda left her there. \nINT. STORAGE LOCKER - NIGHT \nAs he continues, we see an image of him watching over the sleeping girl, his mind, racing. \nMAL (O.S.) I had an out -- hell, I had every reason in the 'verse to leave her lay and haul anchor. \nEXT. MINING CAMP - CONTINUING \nBOOK Not your way, Mal. \nV0 MAL I have a way? \n(THINKS) Is that better than a plan? \nBOOK You can play the thug all you want, but there's more to you than you're ever like to 'fess. \nMAL You just think that 'cause my eyes is all sorrowful and pretty. \nBOOK Only one thing is gonna walk you through this, Mal. Belief. \nMAL Sermons make me sleepy, Shepherd. I ain't looking for help from on high. That's a long wait for a train don't come. \nBOOK When I talk about belief, why do you always assume I'm talking about God? W (Mal has no response) They'll come at you sideways. As he continues, we see: \nEXT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DAY \nInara stands waiting, her back to us, in front of the very vista we first saw her before. The operative comes slowly up the staircase, stands before her. \nBOOK W. (V.0.) It's how they think: sideways. It's how they move. Sidle up and smile, hit you where you're weak. \nEXT. MINING CAMP - CONTINUING \nBOOK Sorta man they're like to send believes hard. Kills and never asks why. \nMAL It's of interest to me how much you seem to know about that world. \nBOOK I wasn't born a Shepherd, Mal. \nMAL Have to tell me about that some time. \nBOOK (looking out) No I don't. He walks away, offering this: \nBOOK \n(CONTINUING) Sideways. Mal watches him go, thinking. \nEXT. CLASSROOM - DAY \nThe Teacher from the very beginning is standing in front of River, whose desktop screen depicts a single, dark planet. \nTEACHER River? Eight-year-old River is working away, not paying attention. \nTEACHER \n(CONTINUING) River, you look tired. I think everybody's a little tired by now; why don't we all lie down. River looks up, scared. All the other children wordlessly get up from their seats and lie on the floor next to them. \nTEACHER \n(CONTINUING) A little peace and quiet will make everything better. She starts to lie down herself, right on the grass. \nMAL I didn't look through the... stuff... just sundries I expect. \nInara smiles blandly, nods. An awkward beat. \nMAL \n(CONTINUING) Well, it's kind of late where I'm at. I'll send a wave as soon as I can. \nINARA Thank you. She disappears. Mal thinks a moment. \nINT. BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER \nMal comes up in, buttoning his shirt. \nWASH Inara. Nice to see her again. \nZOE So, trap? \nMAL Trap. \nZOE We goin' in? moo MAL It ain't but a few hours out... \nWASH Yeah, but, remember the part where it's a trap? \nMAL If that's the case, then Inara's already caught in it. She wouldn't set us up willing. Might be we got a shot at seeing who's turning these wheels. We go in. \nKAYLEE How can you be sure Inara don't just wanna see you? Sometimes people have feelings -- I'm referring here to people... \nMAL Y'all were watching, I take it. Guilty glances. \nKAYLEE Yes. \nMAL 140 You see us fight? \nKAYLEE No. \nMAL Trap. \nEXT. SERENITY - DAY \nThe ship moves gracefully over the mountains. \nINT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING \nWASH We're about seventy miles from the Training house. And nobody on radar... if the Alliance is about, they're laying low. \nMAL They're about. Find us a home. I'll take the shuttle in closer. Zoe, ship is yours. 4dO He starts out, turns back to Zoe. \nMAL \n(CONTINUING) Remember: if anything happens to me, or you don't hear from me within the hour... you take this ship and you come and rescue me. \nZOE What? And risk my ship? \nMAL \n(EXITING) I mean it. It's cold out there. I don't wanna get left. \nEXT. SERENITY - DAY \nShe is nestled in a gorge, overhanging rocks all but burying her from view. The shuttle on the right lifts off from the side of the ship and glides off, keeping low. \nEXT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DAY \nA line of young trainees files by in robes and red shawls pulled over their heads -- one trainee a good deal larger than the others. \nINT. INARA'S ROOM - LATER \nShe is kneeling in front of a statue of Buddha, lighting a few incense sticks. The room is sparsely lush -- not as opulent as the shuttle where she entertained men, but still beautifully furnished and draped. A lace curtain hangs in front of the light, casting its pattern in shadow over everything. Including the rather large figure in a red shawl who kneels beside Inara. \nMAL Dear Buddha, please send me a pony, and a plastic rocket, and -- \nI NAR.A Mal! What are you doing here? \nMAL You invited me. \nWASH Do we care? Are we caring about that? \nJAYNE You dumbass hogs, the only people she's a threat to is us on this boat! \nINT. STORAGE LOCKER - CONTINUING \nRiver is near the ceiling, keeping herself up in a split again, feet against the walls. There is a wire mesh cover to the light, and she has bent part of it out, is working it inside the lock of her shackles. \nINT. PASSENGER DORM - MOMENTS LATER \nMAL Look, we get back to Haven in a 'r/ few hours time -- \nJAYNE Hiding under the Shepherd's skirts, that's a manful scheme -- \nMAL You wanna run this ship? \nJAYNE Yes! \nMAL (small beat) Well you can't! \nJAYNE Do a damn sight better job'n you. Getting us lashed over a couple of strays... (to Simon) No offense, Doc, I think it's noble as a grape the way you look to River, but she ain't my sister (to Mal) and she ain't your crew. Oh, and neither is she exactly helpless! So where's it writ we gotta lay down our lives for her, which is what you've steered us toward. \nMAL I didn't start this. \nJAYNE No, the Alliance starts the war -- and then you volunteer. Battle of Serenity, Mal: besides Zoe here, how many -- (Mal turns away) -- I'm talkin' at you -- how many men in your platoon came out of there alive? Mal stares at him. \nZOE (dead cold) You wanna leave this room. \nJAYNE You're damn right I do. He stalks upstairs. There's a quiet moment. \nINARA This isn't the war, Mal. Mal turns, eyeing her. \nMAL Are you telling me that because you think I don't know -- \nINARA You came to the training house looking for a fight. \nMAL I came looking for you. \nINARA I just want to know who I'm dealing with. I've seen too many versions of you to be sure. \nMAL I start fighting a war I guarantee you'll see something new. \nTO Mal walks out into the cargo bay, Inara following, over: \nSIMON We'll get off. River and I'll get off at Haven and find some -- \nKAYLEE Nobody's saying that. \nWASH Nobody besides Jayne is saying that. \nINT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING \nInara tries to catch up to -- \nINARA Mal. \nMAL \n(TURNING) I got no answers for you, Inara. I got no rudder. Wind blows 40 northerly, I go north. That's who I am. Maybe that ain't a man to lead but they have to follow so you wanna tear me down do it inside your own mind. \nINARA I'm not trying to tear you down -- \nD \nMAL But you fog things up. You always have -- you spin me about. I wish like hell you was elsewhere. \nINARA I was. \nINT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUING \nJayne is looking at the storage locker door. A beat. \nJAYNE \nHe moves to the aft hall, shuts and locks the door. Goes 40 back to the locker and starts to unlock it, pulling his gun. \nZOE Maybe a hundred ships. And more every year. You go through that you're signing up to be a banquet. \nWASH I'm on board with the run and hide scenario -- and we are just about... He looks at his monitors, looks ahead... \nWASH \n(CONTINUING) \nWAIT \nEXT. MINING CAMP - DAY \nThe ship swings around a mountain to come into view of the camp. I s \nIt is a world of fire. Every building burns, some blown right apart. Bodies litter the scene, not one of them moving. There's a grounded Alliance ship not far from the cannon that shot it down. \nINT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING \nWe see Mal's face as the sight hits him like a gut-punch. \nEXT. MINING CAMP - MOMENTS LATER \nThe crew pours out even as the ramp lowers, going off in all directions, calling out to people... Kaylee heads for the burning church. \nKAYLEE Shepherd? Shepherd Book! She stops, looking at the ground by the steeple. There is the body on the ground, face down. The child she played with at dinner. Kaylee stares, at first uncomprehending. ANGLE: MAL, moving in the other direction, approaches the cannon, Jayne behind him. He stops and sees: Book, lying by the cannon, torn up badly from the waist down. \n4 MAL (to Jayne) Get the Doc. He moves to the Shepherd, grabs his searching hand. \nMAL \n(CONTINUING) Shepherd... Don't move. \nBOOK Won't go far... \nMAL Shouldn't've been you. I'm so sorry, it was... they should've hit us. They should've hit me. \nBOOK That crossed my mind. \n(ROUGHS) I shot him down -- \nMAL I seen. \nBOOK I killed the ship... that killed us. Not... very Christian of me. \nMAL You did what's right. \nBOOK (not unkindly) Coming from you, that means... almost nothing... HNAAH! Ah, I'm long gone... \nMAL Doc'll bring you round. I look to be bored by many more sermons 'fore you slip -- don't move -- \nBOOK Can't... order me around, boy. I'm not one of your crew. \nMAL Yes you are. Book coughs up blood, grabbing Mal. Urgent, almost angry. \nBOOK You... it's on you now... all this death, this shit... you have to find a course. This can't mean nothing. River... you have to... \nMAL Come on, keep it up -- Book grabs Mal's face, talks as though replying to something: \nBOOK I don't care what you believe! Just... believe it. Whatever you have to... His breathing becomes laboured. Hitched. Stopped. His hand slips away, his blood leaving a distinct print on Mal's face. Jayne and Simon run up,Simon slowing down -- going to the e he's-dead.----Zne -\u00e2\u0080\u009ea r.7-1, ;,,,r them as Jayne looks around him, Mal still fixed on Book. \nAD \nJAYNE How come they ain't waiting? They know'd we was coming, how come they only sent one? \nMO Zoe realizes the answer, turns to Wash. \nZOE Get on the Cortex. Wave the Sanchez brothers, Li Shen -- anyone whose ever sheltered us after a heist. Tell them to get out. Get out now. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. BRIDGE - LATER \nSilence. Every Cortex screen is on, each looking at a different place. Every one shows fire, destruction or the snow of an interrupted signal. Mal stands alone amidst the screens, saying nothing. After a long moment, all of the screens hitch, the images replaced by identical images of the Operative. He looks solemn. \nTHE OPERATIVE V0 I'm sorry. But I cannot let you hide and I cannot let you run. Things become... extreme. And we wish for another way. \nINARA Please, we should talk this over -- \nJAYNE I ain't takin' orders from a man has lost his brainstem -- , -Mal pule-s-his- in his face, steps back, hand on his. \nV0 \nMAL This is how it works. Anybody doesn't wanna fly with me anymore, this is your port of harbour. There's a lot of fine ways to die. I'm not waiting for the Alliance to choose mine. He walks through the group, toward the smashed cockpit of the Alliance fighter. Struggling to get out is the badly wounded pilot. He sees Mal coming and raises his hands in surrender. Mal shoots him in the head, turns back. \nMAL \n(CONTINUING) I mean to confound those killers, and take my shot at getting to Miranda, maybe finding out what all I'm dying for. That's my theme now. So I hear a word out of any of you that ain't helping me out or taking your leave I will fucking shoot you. He grabs a body -- drops it at Zoe's feet as he heads toward the ship. \nMAL \n(CONTINUING) Get to work. \nEXT. SPACE - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON THE BODIES as they BURN, flames passing over them and suddenly flickering out as dark falls. They are patches of leathered flesh stretched over bone -- monsters, screaming soundlessly in the nothing of space. We arm past them to the windows of the bridge, looking in at Mal, watching, with Zoe behind and Wash at the helm. And we pull back out to see the whole of Serenity for the first time: It is hardly recognizable. Charred corpses on the nose, Cannon atop with a space-suited corpse draped within, long scars, welded-on parts and war paint... the trail of green light burns out with sporadic bursts of vapor. It looks, for all the world, like a Reaver ship. \nINT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING \nMal comes down the stairs to the catwalk. He hesitates, then steps into the shuttle. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdMo \nINT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUING \nIt's dark in here. Mal stands with his back to the door, no light on his face, shaking. Not crying, but overcome. \nLOW \nINARA Mal. He looks up: she's in the corner looking through that trunk of hers, hands on a long oilcloth wrapped around something. \nMAL Didn't see you. \nI NARA I figured that. \nMAL Anything of use in there? \nINARA Maybe. She puts it down and crosses to the bed. He sits by her. \nMAL You don't have to stay in the shuttle, you know. There's empty rooms, if you wanna sleep awhile. \nINARA You think anyone's set to sleep? Simon's portioning out overdoses of morphine, just in case. \nMAL Cheerful fellow. (looking around) Did you really miss this place? \nINARA (rueful smile) Sometimes... Not so much right now. A beat. He doesn't look at her when he asks: \nMAL Why did you leave? Site does lo9}E-at-- t -m- \nINARA Why didn't you ask me not to? \nDissatisfied, Mal rises. \nMAL I, uh, I'd better go check on the VW crew. See how the inevitable mutiny is coming along. They both want to say more. They don't. He goes. \nEXT. SPACE - NIGHT \nSerenity flies, silent. \nINT. FOREDECK HALL/BRIDGE - NIGHT \nThe group make their way toward the bridge. Those close enough to get a view out the window are looking freaked -- those already on the bridge are stock still. Pressed up against the glass of the window is River, just staring. \nEXT. SPACE - CONTINUING \nReverse to see: an armada. The black sky is filled with what must be ninety ships in a vague cluster, as Serenity breaks frame headed toward them. Most of them hang still in the air. Some move swimmingly about. Some turn in gentle drifts, as though looking around. Vd INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING They all wait, tensed up, as they approach the armada... \nEXT. SPACE - CONTINUING \nAnd arrive, moving slowly through the ranks of ships. Serenity passes a large, bizarrely shaped ship. It turns, as though watching her. But lets her pass. Another minute, and Serenity is through the Armada, headed for the small planet just beyond. \nINT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - BRIDGE - LATER \nThe Operative stares blankly at the Ensign. \nINARA They just lay down... They notice River now, in the middle of the street, keening. She drops to her knees, clutching her head. \nAs she speaks we see, as she sees, FLASHES: bodies. In homes, in piles: an entire world, gently dead. \nRIVER , make them stop, they're everywhere, every city every house every room, they're all inside me, I can hear them all and they're saying nothing! GET UP! PLEASE, GET THEM UP! , please God make me a stone... \nJAYNE \n(UPSET) She's starting to damage my calm. \nZOE Jayne -- \nJAYNE She's right! Everybody's dead! This whole world is dead for no reason! \nWASH Let's get to the beacon. \nEXT. LANDING STRIP - DAY \nIt's small -- landing is easier in cities with flying vehicles. At the end of a short runway, tipped and damaged, is an Alliance Research Vessel. The gang makes its way towards it. \nINT. RESEARCH VESSEL - DAY \nIt's a mess, doors pried open, signs of violence but no bodies. The gang walks through it, looking around. River pulls away from Simon, suddenly determined. She approaches a console, and a small cylindrical object. She turns it slightly -- A hologram squawks to life amidst them all. First we see images that resemble the flashes from River's mind: Corpses, everywhere. We hear and then see DOCTOR CARON standing exactly where she was when she recorded this message... (As she speaks, we see angles of everyone watching, taking it in.. River silently mouths every word.) ,two \nCARON -- just a few of the images we've recorded, and you can see it isn't.. it isn't what we thought. There's been no war here, and no terraforming event. The environment is stable. It's the Pax, the G-32 Paxilon Hydroclorate that we added to the air processors. It's... (tearing up) .well it works... it was supposed to calm the population, weed out aggression. Make a peaceful... it worked. The people here stopped fighting. And then they stopped everything else. They stopped going to work, stopped breeding... talking... eating... (trying for control) There's thirty million people here and they all just let themselves die. They didn't even kill themselves. They just... most starved. When they stopped working the power grids, there were overloads, fires -- people burned to death sitting in their V0 chairs. Just sitting. There is a loud bang somewhere behind her -- she starts, gathers herself. \nCARON \n(CONTINUING) I have to be quick. There was no one working the receptors when we landed, so we hit pretty hard. We can't leave. We can't take any of the local transports because... The bang again. \nCARON \n(CONTINUING) There are people... they're not people... about a tenth of a percent of the population had the opposite reaction to the Pax. Their aggressor response increased... beyond madness. They've become... \n(MORE) \nVJ \nCARON (cont'd) they've killed most of us... not just killed, they've done... things. \nV0 \nWASH \n(QUIETLY) Reavers... they made them... \nCARON I won't live to report this, and we haven't got power to... people have to know... (loses it here) We meant it for the best... to make people safer... to... God! She whirls, grabs a gun and fires -- then aims the gun at her own head - but a Reaver is on her, knocks the gun away and bites her face -- She screams continuously as the Reaver tops her, biting at her and tearing at her clothes, at her skin. \nJAYNE \n(QUIETLY) Turn it off. Wash does, nobody saying anything. \nMal walks outside. \nEXT. RESEARCH VESSEL - CONTINUING \nHe takes a few unsteady steps away from the vessel. Inara appears behind him, follows -- he holds a hand out behind him, seemingly to make her stop, but then he grabs her shoulder, holds her for support. She puts her hand over his. \nMAL I seen so much death... I been on fields carpeted with bodies, friends and enemies -- I seen men and women blown to messes no further from me than you. \nINARA Mal... \nMAL But every single one of those people died on their feet. Fighting. \n(MORE) \nV0 \nMAL (cont'd) Or, hell, running away -- doing summat to get through. This is... \nINARA Mal, I need your help with this. I need you to help me, because I can't -- He looks at her, folds her into his arms. Brings her face to his, not kissing but touching, pressing into each other with the urgency of pulsing, necessary life. \nINT. RESEARCH VESSEL - CONTINUING \nRiver falls to her knees, vomiting. Simon goes to her, puts his hand on her back, lets her ride it out. \nINT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - BRIDGE - CONTINUING \nAs the Operative waits with the others. \nHELMSMAN I'm reading activity in the cloud. \nTHE OPERATIVE (into com) Lock and fire on my command. (to himself) You should have let me see her. We should have done this as men. Not with fire... \nHELMSMAN Sir! ,Wd \nEXT. SPACE - CONTINUING \nIt's the Operative's POV: the swirling Ion cloud as Serenity breaks through and heads at us, fully Reavered out. \nINT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - BRIDGE - CONTINUING \nHe looks confused, then smiles at the ruse. Hits the com: \nTHE OPERATIVE Vessel in range, lock on... \n(ADMIRINGLY) Bastard's not even changing course... \nEXT. SPACE - CONTINUING \nAs Serenity get a bit closer, FIFTY REAVER SHIPS suddenly burst from the cloud, also heading straight at us. \nINT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - BRIDGE - CONTINUING \nThe Operative -- and everyone around him - goes big-eyed. \nTHE OPERATIVE That's not good... \nHELMSMAN \n(FREAKING) Sir? \nTHE OPERATIVE Target the Reavers! (into com) Target the Reavers! Target everyone! Somebody FIRE! \nEXT. SPACE - CONTINUING \nSerenity suddenly lists hard to port -- until she's almost upside down -- the Alliance ships FIRE, missing Serenity but tagging a few Reaver ships, none of whom have slowed down -- \nINT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING \nMal is back on the bridge as we look out at the upside down Alliance fleet, missiles just passing us -- \nMAL We're too close for them to arm -- \nZOE This is gonna be very tight -- \nJAYNE \n(ENTERING) Hey look, we're upside down. V0 Zoe and Mal shoot a look at Jayne. \nWASH (to himself) I am a leaf on the wind, watch how I soar. \nEXT. SPACE - CONTINUING \nSerenity slips right under the Operative's ship and ducks and weaves between dozens more. The Reaver force hits the Alliance head on -- and several ships do just that, smashing into bigger ships kamikaze-style, everything exploding -- The fleet mobilizes, blasting Reaver ships, circling around, and an air war begins, a frenzied, balletic ecstasy of destruction that the camera hurtles through as ships and parts of ships fly at and past it. \nANGLE: SERENITY She nearly makes it all the way through the alliance fleet before a barrelling chunk of debris -- which is twice their size -- forces them to come hard about and remain in the fray. \nJ INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING \nMal looks out at the chaos... \nMAL Chickens come home to roost... They are suddenly JOLTED by a glancing blow from another ship -- Wash struggles to control her -- \nMAL \n(CONTINUING) The hell -- \nWASH \n(PANICKY) It's okay! I am a leaf on the wind! \nMAL \nV0 I am. The Operative raises his gun -- but Mal is the quickdraw master, shoots the gun out of the Operative's hand and gets two hits to the chest (armored) before he makes it to cover. \nMAL \n(CONTINUING) Of course, that ain't exactly plan \nA.. He drops out his cartridge and slams another in. The Operative hides behind some machinery. Tries to peek out at Mal -- and more shots send him scrambling back to cover. Mal holsters his gun and jumps for the rung above him, starts going hand over hand to the island, moving as fast as he can. The Operative sees his moment, dives for his gun -- but it's been ruined by Mal's shot. He looks over at Mal with death in his eyes. He runs at the railing, vaults off it, and grabs a chain -- it snaps and he swings, grabbing another. He reaches Mal and double kicks him from behind -- Mal flies 4 off the rung but grabs a chain -- he tries to kick at the Operative, but the guy is frikkin' Tarzan, he climbs up and pulls a lever releasing one end of Mal's chain -- Mal goes swinging, smacks into the wall six feet below the platform. He scrambles up just as the Operative swings himself toward the platform from above. \nINT. BLACK ROOM/INNER CORRIDOR - CONTINUING \nJayne is still firing continuously as he drags Zoe back to the barricades. Simon moves to help -- Kaylee firing now, squinting with effort -- and pulls open the cut back of Zoe's shirt, checks the wound. \nSIMON Spine's intact -- \nZOE Just gimme a bandage. Simon pulls a spraycan from his bag, sprays the wound with a foam that hardens instantly into an elastic covering. \nThere are a few gun shots (as well as nail-balls and blades) from the Reavers. Jayne switches weapons, tossing another to Zoe and opening fire -- \nA0 \nJAYNE Oh, now you're likin' guns, huh? Cheaters! He takes a hit in the shoulder, grimaces and keeps firing. River watches, the gun limp in her hand. Kaylee grabs it and starts another round -- but she's peppered with dart-like projectiles. She screams and drops the weapon, pulling the projectiles from her -- Inara helps her up, pulls her back as Zoe shouts: \nZOE Everybody fall back! Fall back! Everyone stumbles or is dragged into the inner corridor. Inara hits the controls and the doors start to close, from each side and above and below. Then, when the hole is maybe four by four, they stop. \nZOE \n(CONTINUING) Jayne! Grenade! \nJAYNE Very last one... He tosses it through the hole. Zoe doesn't even flinch from the blast as she thinks. \nZOE They're gonna get in -- \nKAYLEE Can close it... from outside... \nZOE No one's coming back from that... She tries to stand, fails. \nZOE \n(CONTINUING) How much ammo do we have? \nJAYNE We got three full cartridges and my swingin' cod. That's all. Inara is by the elevator, pounding for it to come.--- \nINARA Lift isn't moving... \nZOE When they come, try to plug the hole with 'em... Kaylee cries out and Simon moves to her. \nKAYLEE I'm starting to lose some feeling here... I think there's something in them darts they throwed at me. \nSIMON Lie still. I'm gonna give you something to counteract the -- He stands, looking around him. His bag is over by Zoe. \nSIMON \n(CONTINUING) My bag. and SHKOWW!, the bullet takes him in the belly -- everything suddenly moving very slowly as he spins slightly, one foot lifted, a confused expression on his face -- then speeding right back up as he slams down on his back, gasping for air. River's mouth opens in a scream she doesn't make. Blood spreads from Simon's belly. Inara rushes to him, grabs cloth and puts pressure on the wound, puts Simon's hand on it. \nINARA Keep pressure here... \nSIMON My bag. Need... adrenaline... and a shot of calaphar for Kaylee... I can't... River...? She is by his side, takes his hand. She has a kind of serenity to her, like she understands something now. \nSIMON \n(CONTINUING) River... I'm sorry... \nRIVER No. No. The lights go out. Everyone looks about them. Jayne fires again, but all the sound has bled out save these two. \nSIMON I hate to... leave... \nRIVER You won't. You take care of me, Simon. You've always taken care of me. She stands as the emergency lights come on, giving her face an unearthly glow as she looks down at him. \nRIVER \n(CONTINUING) My turn. She's running so fast, nobody has time to react til she DIVES through the hole in the doors, then Simon SCREAMS her name, the scream following us back into the Black Room where River lands in a perfect roll, comes up in a room full of Reavers. Without a moment's hesitation she makes it to the panel, gets the doors closing. She dodges a blade, but a blow to,the back of the head shakes her. She weaves around a couple of Reavers to get to the closing doors, but at the last second her ankle is grabbed and pulled out from under her. The last thing we see is her being dragged back as they swarm over her. ANGLE: THE BLAST DOORS, as they shut with a shuddering RLUNG. \nINT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING \nThe gang is still trying to patch themselves together when the elevator doors open. Mal staggers out, holding his bleeding side. \nZOE Sir? \n140 MAL It's done. Report? Zoe looks at the badly wounded Simon, is about to give a report -- and the doors start to open behind her. Everyone turns to look, those who can feebly raising weapons, as the square iris of the opening blast doors widens to reveal River, standing alone. She is holding two Reaver blades, is bloody but unbowed. And the only one alive. We hold on her a moment, then the wall behind her is ripped completely away. Behind it, grappling hooks chained to a huge tractor pull the wall away as through the smoke come some fifteen Alliance soldiers, who line up, rifles trained on our gang... \nSOLDIER Drop your weapons! Drop 'em now! \nANOTHER SOLDIER Do we engage? Do we engage? \nMal and the others tense up. River turns slowly to face the soldiers, blades still gripped... A soldier levels his gun at her, sweaty and frantic... others still shouting... vp INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING The Operative sits in silence, the voices coming over his com: \nSOLDIER (O.S.) Targets are acquired! Do we have a kill order? Do we have an order? \nINT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING \nCLOSE ON: THE SOLDIER'S FINGER, SQUEEZING THE TRIGGER... \nBLACK OUT. \nEXT. DESERT PLANET - SUNSET \nWe are close on a gravestone. It is rounded, looks more like a bell than a headstone. It is topped by a jar built'into the stone. The jar is weathered tin at top and bottom, but glass in the middle. Inside the glass we can see one of those slightly moving photos. It is of Mr Universe and his lovebot, and the name Mr Universe is carved roughly in the stone beneath. The camera moves to the right and we see another such stone, 40 this one bearing the image and inscription: Shepherd Derrial Book. The third is Hoban Washburne. Wash. The camera continues moving right, but the next stone houses a small home-made rocket with pieces of paper taped to it instead of a picture-jar. And fixing another slip of paper to it is River. She moves away from the stone as Mal does likewise. They're flanked by the crew: Jayne, Inara (to whom Mal moves), Simon, who stands holding River before him and hand in hand with Kaylee. He has a crutch supporting his other side. There is a moment, then they all move aside, saying nothing. Between them walks Zoe, in a simple white funeral gown, holding a burning taper. She stands at the stones a moment, then holds the taper to the rocket fuse. Stands back with the others. The rocket shoots up into the darkening sky. They all watch its sputtering tail a moment, then it it explodes in a series of fireworks. \nWIDE ON the group, as the fireworks go off over their heads. We are close on another explosion when it becomes: CLOSE ON: A BLOWTORCH spitting sparks. Widen to see: \nEXT. REPAIR YARD/SERENITY - DAY \nZoe is harnessed to the nose of the ship, welding on a replacement for the very window the harpoon that impaled Wash came through. \nINT. DUCT INSIDE SERENITY - DAY \nWe are close on River as she works inside a crawlspace just above the engine room, replacing wires. Some of them run to a computer screen that she checks and adjusts. \nEXT. REPAIR YARD/TOP OF SERENITY - DAY \nMal and Jayne hold onto the cannon as a crane is lifting it off the top of the ship. Close on Mal as he watches it go... \nWIDER ANGLE: \nEXT. REPAIR YARD - CONTINUING \nt f o And here we see the whole ship for the first time, harnessed by the wings above the ground so she can be worked on all over. The cannon is being hoisted away from her as a crew of repairmen wheel new landing gear under her belly. \nINT. ENGINE ROOM - DAY \nKaylee, deeply greasy, tweaks a part on the engine and crosses to the back where Simon, shirtless and not entirely ungreasy himself, is wrenching a bolt into place above his head. A moment looking at him and she can't help herself - she slides her arms around his chest... \nEXT. SERENITY - DAY \nOn a scaffold, Inara repaints the name on the nose with elegant precision. \nINT. ENGINE ROOM - DAY \nKaylee and Simon are just making out like fiends, work completely forgotten. With nothing resembling elegant precision, they sink out of frame to the floor. \nV0 \nA beat, and River's head appears from the crawlspace above, looking down at them with detached curiosity. \nEXT. REPAIR YARD/SERENITY - DAY \nIt's raining as Mal is hauling in the last of the repair equipment. The camera moves around him, skirting the ground of the junkyard, till it lands on a figure in foreground, standing watching him from some twenty feet away. Mal stops, doesn't turn. Hand near his gun. \nMAL If you're here to tell me we ain't finished... then we will be real quick. The Operative stands just under the canopy of the nose of the ship, framed by the rain behind. \nTHE OPERATIVE Do you know what an uproar you've caused? Protests, riots -- cries for a recall of the entire Parliament. \nMAL \n(TURNING) We've seen the broadwaves. \nTHE OPERATIVE You must be pleased. \nMAL 'Verse wakes up a spell. Won't be long 'fore she rolls right over and falls back asleep. Taint my worry. \n", "test1_input": "J \nMAL Seems I remember a talk about you giving orders on my boat. \nSIMON Well sleep easy 'cause we're off your boat. Just as soon as River gets her share of the \"bounty\". \nKAYLEE Well let's not do anything hasty... \nMAL No, shiny! I'm sick a' carrying tourists anyhow. We'll be on Beaumonde in ten hours time, you can pick up your earnings and be on your merry. Meantime you do your job. Patch up my crew. A beat. \nRIVER He didn't lie down. They never lie down. She is looking at the Reaver. Everyone does, for a moment. \nINT. FOREDECK HALL - MOMENTS LATER \nMal and Zoe enter from below. \nZOE No, I think things'll glide a deal smoother for us without River and Simon on board... but how long do you think they'll last? \nMAL Doc made his call. They's as babes in a basket when we took 'em in; we sheltered 'em plenty. Man has to cut loose, learn to stand on his own. \nZOE Like that man back in town? They stop by Mal Is room. \nMAL I had to shoot him. What the Reavers woulda done to him before they killed him... \nJ \nZOE I know. That was a piece a' mercy. But before that, him begging us to bring him along... vo, \nMAL We couldn't take the weight. Woulda slowed us down. \nZOE You know that for certain \nMAL Mule won't run with five. I shoulda dumped the girl? Or you? Or Jayne? \n(CONSIDERING) Well, Jayne... \nZOE Coulda tossed the payload. \nMAL And go to Fanty and Mingo with air in our mitts, tell 'em \"here's your share\"? They'd set the dogs on us in the space of a twitch, and there we are back in mortal peril. We get a job, we gotta vo make good. Washenters from the bridge. \nZOE Sir, I don't disagree on any particular point, it's just... in the time of war, we woulda never left a man stranded. \nMAL Maybe that's why we lost. She's not happy with the reply. Mal climbs down to his room as Wash reaches Zoe, slides his arms around her. \nINT. MAL'S ROOM - CONTINUING \nOnce alone, Mal lets his own disappointment show. He pulls off his holster and drops it over a chair. Kicks the toilet closed and sits on his bunk. The place resembles a submarine cabin, with charts and clutter, ancient maps on the walls. \nJ \nMal moves a bunch of papers off his bunk and a picture slides out. Hits the floor and starts moving: it's a snapshot-movie \nOF: \nVW - DAY \nINT. INARA'S SHUTTLE \nWe're close on a beautiful woman who looks at us with amused exasperation. Behind her is an opulently dressed little shuttle. \nINARA Kaylee, are you ever gonna put that capture down? \nKAYLEE (0.5.) We gotta have records of everything. A bona fide Companion entertained clients on this very ship! In this very bed! The picture pans over to the bed -- which River is bending over and sniffing curiously. Inara is packing things up. \nKAYLEE (O.S.) \n(CONTINUING) For one sweet second, we was almost classy. \nINARA 4 You promised to help me pack. \nKAYLEE (O.S.) Honest, Inara, why do you have to leave? Inara shoots an uncertain look at the camera -- and the picture freezes, goes back to the beginning. During all this, Mal has picked it up. He looks at it a moment, tosses it aside. Looks around at nothing much. \nJAYNE (V.0.) I do not get it. How's a guy get so wrong? \nINT. CARGO BAY - LATER \n", "test1_true": "R \nJAYNE Ain't logical. Cuttin' on his own face, rapin' and murdering -- I mean, I'll kill a man in a fair fight... or if I think he's gonna start a fair fight, or if he bothers me, or if there's a woman, or I'm gettin' paid -- mostly only when I'm gettin' paid. But these Reavers... last ten years they just show up like the boageyman from stories. Eating people alive? Where does that get fun? He dumps the body in, she starts the doors closing. \nKAYLEE Shepherd Book said they was men that reached the edge of space., saw a vasty nothingness and just went bibbledy over it. \nJAYNE Hell, I been to the edge. Just looked like more space. \nKAYLEE I don't know. People get awful lonely in the black. Like to get addlepated ourselves, we stay on this boat much longer. Captain'll drive us all off, one by one. \nJAYNE You're just in a whinge cuz that prissy doc is finally disembarking. Me I says good riddance. He never belonged here, and his sister's no saner than one of them Reavers. \nKAYLEE That ain't even so! River's a dear heart and a boon to this crew! You just don't like her 'cause she can read your mind and everything you think is mean. \nJAYNE Well, there is that. \nJ \nKAYLEE Her and Simon could have a place here. Now they're leaving us. Just like Shepherd Book. She looks up toward one of the shuttles. \nKAYLEE \n(CONTINUING) Just like Inara... \nINT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DAY \nAnd here she is, moving back and down into frame, her eyes half closed in passion. She settles on a cluster of brocaded pillows, and we see another head lowering in for a kiss... Come around to see it's another lovely young woman -- and that there is a group of ten others watching intently, all in saris, on their knees. Two handsome young men with shaved heads in the back, also on their knees. Inara stops before the kiss, smiling and coming back up. She speaks to the girls (We hear only soft music) as she repositions the one she's with, lowering again; showing her the motion of surrender as if it were a dance step. \nA WOMAN'S VOICE (V.0.) They love you. \nEXT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DUSK \nInara looks out at the mountains. The space she's in resembles a Tibetan monastery, if slightly more opulent. Widen to see she is with SHEYDRA, a somewhat older Companion, the woman whose voice we heard. She hands Inara a drink. \nSHEYDRA The girls. They've learned more from you these last months than the rest of us could show them in two years. \nINARA They're very sweet. But they're not Companions. \nSHEYDRA \n(WRYLY) You've no hope for them? Junk the lot, start anew? \nJ \nINARA On Sihnon we started training at twelve. Years of discipline and preparation before the physical act of pleasure was even mentioned. Most of these girls -- \nSHEYDRA They're all of good family, the highest academic standards -- \nINARA Control. Was the first lesson. And the last and these worlds are not like the Central Planets. There is barbarism dressed up in the most civil weeds. Men of the highest rank who don't know the difference between a Companion and a common whore. It's unsafe. \nSHEYDRA All the more reason the girls look to you. You came out here alone, before the Alliance ever thought to establish a House this remote. You've seen so much. You're a figure of great romance to them. 4d INARA Great romance has nothing to do with being a Companion, Sheydra. You should know better. \nSHEYDRA I'm not the one who had a torrid affair with a pirate. Inara nearly spills her drink. \nINARA A who? With a what? \nSHEYDRA \n(SMILING) It's the talk of the House. The girls all trade stories in the dorms at night. \nINARA I didn't... have a pirate... \nJ \nSHEYDRA In one of the stories you make love in a burning temple. I think that's my favorite. \nINARA \n(SITTING) This is unbearable. Captain Reynolds is no pirate; he's a petty thief. And he never laid a finger on me. All he ever did was rent me a shuttle and be very annoying. (mutters in Chinese) \nSHEYDRA A year on his shuttle and he never laid a finger on you. No wonder you left. \nINARA \n", "test2_input": "THE OPERATIVE Captain Reynolds, I should tell you so that you don't waste your time: You can't make me angry. \nINARA Oh please. Spend an hour with him. Mal smiles -- then glares at Inara, mouthing \"Hey!\" \nTHE OPERATIVE I need her, Captain. River is... my purpose and I will gather her to me. The brother as well. Whatever else happens is incidental. In the greater scheme. \nMAL Why is it that the greater scheme always makes everything not that great? \nTHE OPERATIVE I want to resolve this like civilized men. I'm not threatening you. I'm unarmed. \nMAL Great! He draws and shoots the Operative in the chest. The Operative goes down as Mal grabs Inara, moves for the-doorway. The Operative is on him in a second, choke-hold from behind. \nTHE OPERATIVE I am of course wearing full body armor. I'm not a moron. He tosses Mal hard against a wall, spinning and blocking a blow from Inara -- she is clearly trained in martial arts, but he flat-heels her to the ground within seconds. Mal is going for his gun again, turning, and the Operative kicks him in the face, sends him back, gun flying. Mal gets to his feet and they square off. Mal breathing hard, nose dripping blood. The Operative perfectly poised, waiting. \nMAL No back up? We're making an awful ruckus... \nTHE OPERATIVE They'll come when they're needed. \nMAL I'd start whistling. \nTHE OPERATIVE Captain, what do you think is going to happen here? They come at each other. The Operative is the much better trained -- he's fluid, his blows sparse and deadly. \nMal is more bluster and determination, and the operative's precision is wearing Mal down. Mal punches wild -- the Operative counters with a spin-kick V0 to the head that sends Mal to the ground not far from Inara, breathing hard. He tries to rise again, painfully, but Inara places her hand on his arm. The Operative goes to his briefcase by the door, pulls out his sword. His face has taken on that remote kind of fascination as he looks at it. \nTHE OPERATIVE \n(CONTINUING) Nothing here is what it seems. \nINARA I know. \nTHE OPERATIVE He's not the plucky hero. The Alliance isn't some evil empire. This isn't the grand arena. \nINARA And that's not incense. He turns to look: the incense stick burns away -- rather like a fuse -- and FLASHES in an explosion of light and sound. \nIt's a flash-bomb: The Operative sails back as everything goes smoky white and the sound dies to a tiny buzz. The Operative tries to get his bearings -- and four armored soldiers are in his face, asking him for orders... Mal and Inara are gone. He motions for the men to follow them. \nTHE OPERATIVE Just a flash bomb. Go! Go! \nINT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - CONTINUING \nInara leads Mal (who is reholstering his gun) down some steps and along a corridor. The sound is still tinny and weird. \nMAL .I had him... \nINARA What? \nMAL (deafly loud) I think that I was winning! \nEXT. SIDE OF MOUNTAIN, BY MAL'S SHUTTLE - DAY \nMal and Inara move quickly down the mountain. They look to see that Mal's shuttle has four Alliance guards waiting by V0 it. Mal ducks back out of sight, pulls a fancy-looking grenade out of his pocket. Pops the top and hurls it over at the foursome. CLOSE ON: THE GRENADE, as a series of bars of light go out one by one, counting down -- \nALLIANCE SOLDIER Grenade! Everybody dives for cover. The moment they do, Mal and Inara race into the shuttle, Mal sweeping up the grenade just as the last light goes out and nothing happens. One soldier turns to look and Mal shoots him back down as the door shuts on him and Inara. \nINT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUING \nInara pushes into the pilot's seat. \nINARA Hang on to something. \nMAL 4 You sure you remember how it -- He nearly falls over as: \nEXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUING \nThe shuttle shoots straight up, spinning and heading out. \nINT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUING \nInara stares straight ahead, relaxing her grip on the controls. Mal is gone. \nINARA I told you to hang on. \nMAL (O.S. ) (in great pain) I'm fine... \nEXT. SPACE - LATER \n", "test2_true": "These objects are roughly the size of pony-kegs, and clearly home-made, parts welded together almost haphazardly. They all spark silently to life -- and shoot off in six different directions, as Serenity herself fires up her Firefly effect and burns away from us. \nINT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DAY \nThe Operative sips tea and rubs his temple. \nTHE OPERATIVE (into a com) Forget the pulse beacon, there has to be another way to track the ship -- get a read on the nav sat. It's a registered transport, you must be able to locate -- \nENSIGN (O.S.) Sir? \nTHE OPERATIVE Have you found a nav sat trajectory? \nENSIGN (O.S.) Sir... we've found seven. The Operative looks more unhappy than angry. \nTHE OPERATIVE (to himself) Does he think this is a game? \nEXT. CLASSROOM - DAY \nThe teacher and students sleep as River -- as we saw her in the institute, older, with blood seeping from the needle- holes in her head -- makes her way through them. Slowly she walks to the floating lecture screen. On it is the solar system, glowing lines connecting all the stars and planets. She becomes wide-eyed, breathing hard as it pushes in to one system, one planet... She looks over to one side of the tent, and we see: \nINT. LAB - CONTINUING \nHer POV is of the lab. There stand some five older men in formal dress. They stare at her, impassive. We see flashes of corpses, lying in houses, in city streets -- and a Reaver's screaming face -- \nINT. STORAGE LOCKER - DAY \nAnd River awakens. A moment to get her bearings, then her eyes narrow with intent. \nINARA (V.0.) We have every reason to be afraid. \nINT. PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING \nJAYNE Why, 'cause this guy beat up Mal? That ain't so hard -- \nMAL He didn't beat me up -- \nINARA Because he's a believer. \nINT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP, A DARK CABIN \nAs Inara continues, we see: Fanty and Mingo, tied to chairs. Light spills onto their bruised faces as the Operative enters. \nINARA (V.0.) He's intelligent, methodical and devout in his belief that killing River is the right thing to do. \nINT. PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING \nINARA I honestly think the only reason we haven't been blown out of the air is that he needs to see her. \nSIMON Needs to see her why? \nINARA I'm uncertain. I would say to be sure of the kill, but... I just know he'll kill us all to get to her. \nJAYNE So no hope of a reward, huh? \nZOE Did he mention a deal of any kind? \nIWO \nMAL (looking at Simon) Give the two of them up. Go my way. \nJAYNE Which you was all ready to do not a day ago. What went sour? \nMAL Cutting them loose ain't the same as handing them over. \nJAYNE That so? 'Cause the corpse I'm about to become is having trouble telling the difference. \nSIMON (to Inara) Did he say anything about a \"Miranda\"? \nINARA What is that? \nMAL Don't know who or what, but it's on River's mind. Conjure it might be the reason he's after her. \nINARA You think maybe it poses some kind of threat to the Alliance? \n", "test3_input": "JAYNE Go! The entire crew piles out, all heavily bedecked with weapons. \nMAL Head inside! \nV0 \nINT. BLACK ROOM/INNER HALL - MOMENTS LATER \nA small double-sized doorway leads to the \"Black Room\", which is the entrance proper to the facility. Mal hits a button and huge, thick, blast doors open from the sides AND the top and bottom, creating the effect of a square hole getting bigger. The hall itself is smaller than the black room, but still has the arrows on the ceiling, that point to an elevator some fifty feet away. \nMAL Come on. Jayne, rearguard. Zoe slows, looking around her. \nZOE Sir. (he turns to her) This is a good hold point_ \nMAL We all stay together -- \nZOE No. They have to come through here; they'll bottleneck and we can thin 'em out. We get pushed ,oO back there's the blast doors. \nKAYLEE I can rig 'em so they won't re- open once they close. \nMAL Then shut 'em and hide til -- \nZOE We need to draw them til it's done. This is the place. We'll buy you the time. \nJAYNE (to the others) Move those crates back there for cover -- and make sure they ain't filled with anything goes boom. \nKAYLEE Wait, Wash -- where's Wash? Nobody (but River) realized he wasn't there. Zoe is dead calm. ,No ZOE He ain't comin'. Everybody takes that in, Kaylee's eyes welling up. \nJAYNE Move the gorram crates! Come on! We hear savage SCREAMS from the hanger -- they're approaching. Mal moves to the door, Jayne beside him. \nANGLE: HIS POV Reavers rush toward them. He turns to Jayne. \nMAL Tell me you brought 'em this time... Jayne smiles grimly, tosses Mal a grenade as he pops his own and fastballs it at the Reavers. \nJ \nIt explodes in their midst, smoke and man-parts flying about. Mal rolls his a shorter distance, then slams the door shut. \nANGLE: THE GRENADE \nExplodes, raining a bunch of equipment -- and part of a catwalk -- right in front of the door. In the black room, the door nearly buckles from the explosion. Everyone takes positions behind the crates. Zoe stands calmly, her back to the door, loading her sawed-off. \nMAL (continuing; moving back to Zoe) Zoe... are you here? She looks up at him. \nZOE Do the job, sir. \nMAL You hold. Hold till I'm back. He takes off -- passes Inara, the two of them holding a look for as long as they can. Then he's in the elevator and gone. Jayne moves over to Zoe. \nJAYNE Captain's right. Can't be thinking on revenge if we're gonna get through this. \nZOE You really think any of us are gonna get through this? He looks back at their army: A companion, a doctor, a mechanic and a more-than-usually out of it River. A beat, and he looks back at Zoe with forlorn hope: \nJAYNE I might... \nINT. MR UNIVERSE'S HQ - MOMENTS LATER \nThe elevator stops and Mal makes his way to the island of screens and machines in the center of the space. The first thing he takes in is that every broadwave port has been destroyed. The second: \nANGLE: MR UNIVERSE is lying dead, eyes open, half draped on his equally still lovebot. A trail of blood shows he crawled from his chair. \nV0 Mal comes close. Nothing. He starts to move away again and the lovebot turns her head, her eyes focusing with an audible whir. She speaks with surprisingly realistic expressiveness, and a warped, computery version of Mr Universe's voice. \nLOVEBOT Mal. Mal stops. \nLOVEBOT \n(CONTINUING) Guy killed me, Mal. He killed me with a sword. How weird is that? I got... a short span here... they destroyed my equipment but I have a back-up unit... bottom of the complex, right over the generator. Hard to get to. I know they missed it. They can't stop the signal, Mal. They can never stop the signal. \n(BEAT) Okay this is painful. On many levels. I'm not -- \nA0 She turns back, powering down. Recording over. A beat, and Mal takes off. \nINT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING \nInara is on her knees, unwrapping the oilcloth we saw in her shuttle. River is in the corner, clutching her head. \n", "test3_true": "SIMON It's okay... - \nRIVER They're all made up of rage. I can't... A BANG as a body slams against the door. \nSIMON Just stay low. I'm right here. \nJayne moves past them to Zoe, takes position by her. \nJAYNE She picked a sweet bung of a time to go helpless on us. \nZOE (calls out) Jayne and I take the first wave. Nobody shoots less they get past our fire. Simon moves to Kaylee, who is shaky as hell. The bangs on the door continue. \nKAYLEE Oh, I didn't plan on going out like this. I think we did right, but... \nSIMON I never planned... anything. I just wanted to keep River safe. Spent so much time on Serenity trying to find us a home I never realized I already had. She looks at him with soft surprise. \nSIMON \n(CONTINUING) My one true regret in all this is never being with you. \nKAYLEE With me? You mean to say, as, sex? \nSIMON \n(SMILES) I mean to say. Kaylee snaps her cartridge home with way more precision than we might expect from her, takes steady aim at the door. \nKAYLEE Hell with this. I'm gonna live. Simon looks at her a moment, then turns his attention to the door. Inara come up into frame with the contents of the oilcloth: a bow and arrow, which she pulls back with focused grace. ANGLE: THE DOOR starts to come off its hinges. \nINT. MR UNIVERSE'S HQ - CONTINUING \nA panel is kicked in from the ceiling and the Operative drops down, having clearly entered from a different location. He looks around, carrying a laser-pistol. He moves past Mr Universe and Lenore -- \nLOVEBOT \nMAL (The Operative turns) Guy killed me, Mal. \nINT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING \nMal has reached it and surveys the situation. Before him is a railing, and he can look down on the generator shaft. It's miles deep, with machines rotating and grinding, and arcs of electricity ricochetting around it. On the other side is a platform, with the broadwave console sitting behind a clear plastic partition. Cables and chains run along the ceiling, around a series of ladder rungs. \nMAL Hard to get to. That's a fact. \nINT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING \nlw\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd The door is pried partially open -- enough for one Reaver to squeeze through and charge. Zoe stands up and shoots him in the head. He arcs back hard as the second comes, Zoe shoots him, calmly walking toward the door -- \nJAYNE Zoe... Gorramnit... But she is in a trance, and we see beneath the calm, to the bubbling magma of rage that keeps her firing, single shots, each one a kill, till five men down and she's out of ammo. The sixth comes at her swinging a blade and she blocks, the precision of military training still in her as she flips him, wresting the blade free and swinging it down out of frame, bringing it up bloody, swinging again as the door bursts open and she's rushed from behind --- But Jayne totes an automatic, sprays killing fire on the lot, moving forward himself -- \nJ \nJAYNE \n(CONTINUING) ZOE! Get yer ass back in the line! vo\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd She looks up, almost confused -- and one of Jayne's targets comes back off the ground and slices at her back with a blade, she screams as he cuts deep -- and an arrow lodges in his neck. Inara pulls up a fresh arrow, shaking only slightly. \nINT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - LATER \nMal is on the railing, reaching for the 'rungs' on the ceiling just above him. He can almost get them -- one wrong move and he pitches into the jaws of death... A laser shot nails him in the lower back -- he arches, legs sliding off the rail -- he falls and hits the rail with the backs of his legs, flipping painfully onto his face as he falls, mercifully, back onto the platform. The Operative comes around some equipment for a closer shot as Mal gets shakily up. \nMAL (in pain) Shot me in the back. I haven't... made you angry, have I? I s \nTHE OPERATIVE There's a lot of innocent people in the air being killed right now. \nMAL You have no idea how true that is. There's no wise-ass attitude in him now. They stand, facing off at ten paces. \nMAL \n(CONTINUING) I know the secret now. The truth that burned up River Tam's brain and set you after her. And the rest of the 'verse is gonna know it too. 'Cause they need to. \nTHE OPERATIVE You really believe that? \nMAL I do. \nTHE OPERATIVE You willing to die for that belief? \n"}

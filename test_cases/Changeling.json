So \"incompetent,\" as in -- (reads) \"A department so incompetent that they never realized that up to twenty children were being kidnapped and murdered under their very noses.\" (looks over) And here: \"So incompetent that they insisted they knew better than a mother the identity of her own child, forced him upon her, and then incarcerated her when she confronted them with evidence of their own reprehensible behavior.\" That was a two-fer. Incompetent and reprehensible in the same sentence. Guy must be a real terror at crossword puzzles. \nDavis gets up and crosses the room, looking out through the slatted windows at the busy Los Angeles street outside. \nDAVIS Captain, your handling of the Collins case has exposed this department to public ridicule. There is even the potential for civil and criminal liability. JONES Sir, nobody could have known what was going on up at that ranch.

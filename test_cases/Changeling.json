{"train": "CHANGELING A True Story \nWritten by \nJ. Michael Straczynski \nFADE IN: \nBLACK SCREEN \nOn which appears: \nEVERYTHING YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE, HAPPENED \nThe words slowly FADE OUT, taking us hard into \nEXT. COLLINS HOME - PRE-DAWN \nA small, pleasant house on a tree-lined street in Los Angeles circa 1928. 210 North Avenue 23. Not far from Dodger Stadium. \nSUPERIMPOSE: LOS ANGELES, MARCH 9, 1928. \nINT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN \nA Bakelite alarm clock hits 6:30 A.M. and RINGS. CHRISTINE COLLINS, thirties, attractive, rumpled, reaches INTO FRAME to shut it off. She sits up, rubs tiredly at her face, and moves OS, switching on a radio as she goes. Music fills the air. \nINT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nShe throws water on her face as the music continues. She looks at herself in the mirror as the light flickers overhead. She hits the wall offhandedly, something she does every day. The flickering stops. With a last look at the mirror, she smoothes back her hair and exits, switching off the light. \nINT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - LATER Dressed now, she flicks on the overhead light. WALTER COLLINS is nine years old, with light brown hair, though we don't see much of it or him, he's entangled in the sheets. It's important that we don't see him too clearly in most of the following scenes, but without drawing attention to that aspect. \nCHRISTINE Walter...time for school, honey. \nShe sits on the edge of the bed, runs a hand through his hair. \nWALTER Just ten more minutes -- \nCHRISTINE Sorry, champ. (more) \nCHANGELING A True Story                                       2. \nCHRISTINE (Cont'd) You can sleep in all you want tomorrow, that's what Saturdays are for. Now hurry up or your breakfast will get cold. \nWALTER It's cereal, it's supposed to be cold. \nShe smiles, kisses him on the forehead, and exits. He sits on the edge of the bed, wavers, then falls back into bed again. \nEXT. PASADENA AVENUE - MORNING \nA street-car (known then as the Big Red) rumbles down the street in the gray light of morning, passing Ford Model A's and Hudsons and Nash four-door sedans. \nINT. STREET-CAR - CONTINUOUS \nChristine sits on one of the benches, Walter's face buried in her lap, still half-asleep. She nudges him as they come to an intersection by a grade school. It's early enough that only a few other kids have arrived. \nCHRISTINE We're here, sweetie.   Come on. \nShe hands him a sack lunch and follows as he slouches toward the door. She watches from the curb as he heads toward the school. Some of the teachers lounging outside nod to her as Walter approaches, so she knows they're aware that he's there. \nShe waves, then hurriedly gets back on the street-car as it rumbles away. \nINT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY Located on Grand Avenue downtown, the huge switchboard room is a maze of switching stations, tangles of wires and heavy wooden headsets...a roar of buzzers, bells, circuits opening and closing, and a hundred female operators speaking at once. \nSupervisors on skates roll up and down the narrow lanes created by the banks of switching stations, going from one operator to another as needed. Christine is one of them. She turns at the SOUND of a bell struck twice, then rolls down the lane toward an OPERATOR frantically waving a pink sheet of paper. \nCHRISTINE Okay Sandy, what's the prob-- \nThe mortified operator hands her the headset and stalks off. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                       3. \nOPERATOR You deal with this one, I'm not going near it. \nChristine struggles on the headset. \nCHRISTINE Hello? Yes, this is the supervisor, ma'am, what can I -- (checks board) Yes, I can see that you're on a party line, ma'am, what can I -- (beat) I know, it's unfortunate, but people sometimes do listen in on party lines. We hope to have private lines installed by -- (beat) Well, what's he doing when you're on the phone? (beat) Are you sure? Maybe there's a problem with the phone line. He could be asthmatic, or -- (beat) Oh. No, I...I've never heard of anything like that before either. Guess there's a first time for everything, right? No, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about people abusing the equipment or... themselves. I'm sorry. I -- \nShe reacts to the phone being hung up hard at the other end as the floor manager, BEN HARRIS, 30s, approaches. \nMR. HARRIS Everything all right? CHRISTINE Fine, Mr. Harris...fine...just someone having a problem with a... with the connection. \nMR. HARRIS Tell them to take the plug and shove it in and out a few times, that'll usually do it. \nCHRISTINE Unfortunately that was part of the problem. If you'll excuse me.... \nShe roller-skates off toward another operator waving another pink sheet of paper. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                       4. \nEXT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - LUNCH AREA - DAY \nChristine sits alone, eating a bag lunch and reading a thick telephone company manual. Working hard to advance herself. \nThen a bell rings: time to return to work. Other employees gather up their belongings and start inside. As Christine closes the book, her bookmark falls out. As she picks it up, we see that it's a child's drawing: her and Walter (with arrows indicating who is who) on a green hill, under an orange sun. \nShe touches the drawing and smiles as the bell rings again. She grabs her belongs and heads back inside. \nShe hangs up. She doesn't like this, but there's no way out of it. She straightens and heads out of the room. \nINT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nA disappointed Walter sits on the couch as Christine puts things together quickly. \nCHRISTINE There's a sandwich and milk in the icebox, and I've asked Mrs. Riley if her daughter can stop by in a couple of hours, just to -- \nWALTER I can take care of myself. \nCHRISTINE Of course you can. She's coming by to check on the house, not you. \nShe stops in front of him, kneels down to eye height. \nCHRISTINE Tomorrow, we'll go to the movies. Then we'll ride the Big Red down to Santa Monica and walk on the pier. How's that? That okay? (more) \nCHANGELING A True Story                                      8. \nCHRISTINE (Cont'd) (he nods) Good. I'll be back before it gets dark. \nWALTER I'm not afraid of the dark.     I'm not afraid of anything. \nCHRISTINE I know you're not, honey. That's how I raised you. (kisses his head) Be good. See you in a bit. \nShe heads out, the screen door clattering shut behind her. \nEXT. COLLINS HOME - CONTINUOUS \nShe crosses the lawn and turns at the sidewalk, glancing back as Walter looks out at her from the window. She waves. He waves back. With one last look, she continues off. \nINT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY \nIf the place was hectic before, now it's even worse: lines buzzing, voices chattering, operators following Christine around with papers and question. \nOPERATORS We've got lines jammed from here to Ohio...he insists on talking to someone in charge...I've tried everything and the console's just dead...I need your signature here for a supply requisition.... \nChristine glances up at the clock, 4:39.    She's already late. But she does what's necessary. \nCHRISTINE All right, get me the Omaha routing station, see if we can put the calls through their switchers...and let's get that console running.... \nShe hurries off to take care of it all, the others following. \nINT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - HALLWAY - LATER \nSTART on a clock which reads 5:20, then TILT DOWN as Christine comes out of the switchboard room, pulling on a sweater, ready to leave...as the floor manager steps out of his office. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                      9. \nMR. HARRIS Christine...good, I was hoping to catch you. I've been following your work reports, and I just want you to know that I'm very impressed. \nShe glances down the block. The street car is approaching, but she doesn't want to piss off her boss by running off. \nMR. HARRIS When I first suggested hiring female supervisors, my superiors weren't big on the idea. But you've held your own as well as any of our male supervisors, and -- \nCHRISTINE Thank you, Mr. Harris, but I -- \nMR. HARRIS Ben, please. Point is, we're looking for someone to take on a managerial position in our new Beverly Hills office. If you're interested I can -- \nCHRISTINE That's great, Mr. Harris, I really appreciate the vote of confidence. \nMR. HARRIS Good, good...so maybe we could -- \nShe looks up to see the streetcar right at the stop. \nCHRISTINE I'm sorry, but I really have to go. We'll talk on Monday. Good night! She races out to \nEXT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - CONTINUOUS \nrunning after the streetcar as it closes its doors. \nCHRISTINE Wait...wait...hold on, just a -- \nBut the streetcar rumbles away before she can catch it. Frustrated, she glances at her watch and sighs resignedly. \nINT. STREET-CAR - EARLY EVENING \nChristine sits on the front bench, watching as the shadows lengthen, then pulls the bell. The car rumbles to a stop as she steps out onto the sidewalk. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                           10. \nEXT. STREET - EARLY EVENING \nShe passes a grocery store, where a clock reads 6:15, and continues past other houses on the pleasant, green street. We HEAR parents telling their kids to come in for dinner, radios playing music or radio dramas. Peaceful, charming. Christine smiles, turns the corner, looks to her house -- \n-- and it's dark, closed up. No lights on inside, no music or dramas on the radio. Dead silent. \nChristine pauses, then picks up her pace. No need to panic, he could be upstairs asleep, could be in the back of the house, where the lights wouldn't show. \nShe goes to the front door.     It's unlocked.    She enters -- \nINT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nIt's dark, silent.    She puts her purse down.     Looks around. \nCHRISTINE Walter? \nNothing.   She goes into \nINT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - MORNING \nChristine watches out the curtained living room windows, eyes red rimmed from worry but not from tears, not yet, as a police car finally pulls up. Neighbors look on as the officers get out and approach the house. HOLD on Christine's face, pale and worried, UNDER: \nREV. BRIEGLEB (V.O.) Our thoughts go out again to Mrs. Christine Collins, of Lincoln Heights -- \nEXT. ST. PAUL'S PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - DAY Located at 5100 Coliseum Street \nREV. BRIEGLEB (V.O.) -- whose young son, Walter Collins, disappeared almost two weeks ago. \nINT. ST. PAUL'S CHURCH - DAY \nA large radio microphone with the call letters KGF is atop a podium, where PASTOR GUSTAV BRIEGLEB stands: fifties, barrel chested, no-nonsense, a fire-and-brimstone preacher. His congregation sits in hard wooden pews, listening and nodding. \nREV. BRIEGLEB Though she is not a member of our congregation, we pray for her today (more) \nCHANGELING A True Story                                    14. \nREV. BRIEGLEB (Cont'd) as we have every day since we first learned of her situation on the radio, and in the newspapers. (beat) We are told that the Los Angeles Police Department is doing the best it can to reunite mother and child, and I am sure that is true. (beat) But given its position as the most violent, corrupt and incompetent police department this side of the Rocky Mountains, that's not saying a great deal. \nThere's APPLAUSE and cheering from the pews.   He lets it pass. \nREV. BRIEGLEB Every day, new bodies show up along Mulholland, or in ditches, the work of Police Chief James Davis and his so-called \"gun squad.\" Every day the needs of honest citizens are put second to greed and personal gain. Every day, the city sinks deeper into a cesspool of fear, intimidation and corruption. Once the City of Angels, Los Angeles is now a place where our protectors have become our brutalizers...where to be the law...is to be above the law...where none dare speak truth to power. (beat) But we will not be silent. We will continue to put their offenses and their failures in full view of the public. We will not be intimidated. \nThe place erupts into applause and cheering. \nINT. POLICE CHIEF JAMES DAVIS' OFFICE - DAY \nPOLICE CHIEF JAMES E. DAVIS, 40s, hard-edged and tall, stands looking out the window as the radio drones on behind him. \nREV. BRIEGLEB (on radio) Because while the \"gun squad\" speaks in the only language Chief Davis understands, we speak in the language of compassion, truth and strength. We speak for our fellow citizens, beaten and killed by a renegade police department. (more) \nCHANGELING A True Story                                     15. \nREV. BRIEGLEB (on radio) (Cont'd) We speak for an innocent child, ripped from his mother's arms, now all but forgotten by the police. And that voice, my friends, will never be silenced. \nMore cheers and applause as Davis switches off the radio. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nThe alarm goes off, but Christine is already awake. Staring up at the ceiling. She slowly pulls herself up and moves OS. \nSUPERIMPOSE: APRIL 3, 1928 \nINT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nChristine walks past the door to his bedroom. Looks inside. Goes over to the bed. Her hand lingers, touching it, UNDER: \nMR. HARRIS (V.O.) Are you sure you're ready for this, Christine? \nINT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - HALLWAY - DAY \nChristine and Mr. Harris, the floor manager, approach the doors to the switchboard room. \nMR. HARRIS I mean, if you need more time -- \nCHRISTINE The police are doing all they can, and frankly I could use the money. It's been almost a month, and...it wouldn't do any good to find Walter and bring him home if he doesn't have a home to come back to, right? \nMR. HARRIS Of course. \nHe smiles as he says it, but there's the sense that he doesn't think Walter's coming back. It's been too long. She senses it, but moves past it, pushing open the door and entering \nINT. SWITCHBOARD ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAs loud as before...until the operators see Christine, and the noise stops. She tries to smile, as if to say, I'm okay, but can't quite manage it. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                      16. \nSeveral women approach and hug her as the noise level begins to climb, but nowhere near what it was a moment earlier. \nMR. HARRIS Well...I'll leave you to it, then. \nShe nods as he exits, then heads off herself. \nINT. SWITCHBOARD ROOM - LATER \nChristine moves from station to station, the noise level still noticeably low. Every time she approaches an operator, they lower their voices, as if not to bother her. \nOne operator holds up a pink request sheet. Christine starts toward her, but then the operator glances to another supervisor and hands it off. Knowing she has to do something about this, she turns to the room and, in a firm, clear voice, says: \nCHRISTINE Excuse me, can I have your attention? \nThe room grows quiet.   Everyone is looking at her. \nCHRISTINE Listen, everyone, I appreciate your consideration, but I'm not made of porcelain. I won't break down and cry if the station to station call to Kankakee doesn't go through. (a thin smile) Actually, I...promised myself that I wouldn't cry...wouldn't let myself cry...until I knew, one way or another, what.... (beat) Point is...I like the noise here. So don't be afraid to talk and...push buttons, and drop things. If it wasn't noisy, how would I know I was in the right place? \nShe manages a thin smile as the place returns to normal. \nEXT. PHONE COMPANY LUNCH AREA - AFTERNOON \nMr. Harris steps out into the lunch area where a number of the operators and supervisors are hanging out. \nMR. HARRIS Excuse me, has anyone seen Christine? \nOPERATOR I think I saw her in the back office. \nJONES Mrs. Collins? \nShe manages a nod. Behind her eyes is the terror: he's going to tell me my son is dead. The room gets very quiet. \nJONES My name is Captain J. J. Jones, Lincoln Park Juvenile Division. My office supervises all runaway and missing child cases, including your son's, and.... (beat, a smile) He's alive, Mrs. Collins. He was picked up two days ago by local police in De Kalb, Illinois. He's safe and unhurt. He was in the company of some drifter, we've got an APB out for him now, and -- \nBut she hasn't heard anything past he's safe and unhurt. She almost goes to the floor as other women rush toward her, crying and embracing her. \nFor the first time, Christine cries, great wracking sobs, all the emotion she's been fighting back all this time coming out at last...he's okay...he's okay. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. UNION STATION - DAY \nJones and Christine are in a police car pulling up to the train station. It moves through a police line holding back a crowd of reporters who SHOUT questions at the passing car. \nCHRISTINE All these reporters...you didn't tell me -- \nJONES Yours is a story with a happy ending, Mrs. Collins. People love happy endings. (checks watch) Train should be pulling in shortly. We'd better get a move on. \nAs Christine and Jones step out, they're mobbed by the press. Jones smiles splendidly for the cameras, waves, one arm wrapped around Christine, who looks stunned by it all. \nJONES Thank you...we'll have a statement for you in a little while. (more) \nCHANGELING A True Story                                      21. \nJONES (Cont'd) Right now the important thing is to re-unite this little lady with her son. So if you'll excuse us.... \nBeaming, Jones escorts Christine into Union Station. \nINT. TRAIN - DAY \nSeated on a bench is a POLICE MATRON, and beside her, the BOY from the De Kalb diner...who we will identify henceforth as \"Walter.\" He is looking out the window at the passing scenery. \n\"WALTER\" Did you know that Los Angeles is where they make the Tom Mix movies? \nMATRON No, I didn't. \n\"WALTER\" His horse is named Blue. (beat) You think they'll let me watch them make a movie? \nMATRON I don't know, you'll have to ask. But with all this attention, who knows, maybe they will. \nThe boy turns his attention back out the window as we HEAR the WHISTLE of the train pulling into Union Station. \nINT. UNION STATION - TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY \nWe HEAR the same train whistle from this side as Christine and Jones come to the ramp, POLICE CHIEF DAVIS is waiting. The reporters are held back at the entrance to the platform. \nJONES Mrs. Collins, I'd like to introduce you to Chief of Police James E. Davis. \nCHRISTINE Oh, my, I didn't expect -- \nDAVIS We don't get a lot of positive attention from the boys in the press these days, so it's good to be here when there's a positive story, don't you think? \nCHANGELING A True Story                                   22. \nBut she's distracted, looking off to the end of the platform, where the train is starting to pull in. \nDAVIS I take it you've been treated well by my boys in the department? \nCHRISTINE Oh...yes, of course, they've been great. Well, there was that part about having to wait twenty-four hours before filing a report, but -- \nDAVIS Technicalities aside -- \nThe train stops.    Doors begin to open. \nCHRISTINE Yes...other than that, no complaints. They've all been wonderful. \nDAVIS Good, then you won't have any problem telling that to the press, and how the LAPD is concerned first and foremost with the safety of -- \nBut she's already running down the platform as people start to step off the train. Jones exchanges a look with Davis. \nJONES Women.    Just a sec.... \nHe trots off to catch up with Christine, who walks alongside the train, looking from window to window, anxious, eager. \nThen: the Matron gets off the train, her frame momentarily blocking the view of the boy beside her...but Christine spots them. With Jones not far behind, she breaks into a run. \nCHRISTINE Walter...Walter! \nShe runs toward them. The matron turns, sees her, smiles and gets out of the way, revealing the boy. \nChristine stops. Staggers so hard she almost falls. She steps forward slowly, a hand going to her mouth. For a moment, we're not sure what's going through her mind. She looks to the matron, who smiles. Looks to the boy, who smiles. \nThen she steps back a pace, horror sinking in as Jones comes jauntily alongside her. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                      23. \nJONES Well?   Aren't you going to -- \nCHRISTINE He's not my son. \nJones freezes at the words. \nJONES I...what are you -- \nCHRISTINE He's not my son. (beat) He's not my son. \nMRS. RILEY My last concession to vanity; men don't make passes at women who wear glasses, you know. (checks the watch) Five o'clock. \nCHRISTINE Thank you. \nMrs. Riley nods and heads inside as Christine looks to Tarr, who shrugs off what was just demonstrated. \nDR. TARR A boy is much larger than a watch, Mrs. Collins. (to \"Walter\") Come along, son. \nTarr takes \"Walter's\" hand and heads away, Christine following, anger growing in her eyes as we HEAR: \nCHRISTINE (V.O.) This is absolutely outrageous! INT. COLLINS HOME - KITCHEN - DAY \nShe is on the phone, \"Walter\" finishing up his dinner in BG. \nCHRISTINE Captain, I...no, listen to me, this so-called doctor paraded me around my own neighborhood like some kind of derelict mother who couldn't even recognize her own -- (beat) He found what he expected to find, what you obviously told him he would find, but it's not -- (beat) No, I am not reassured. (more) \nCHANGELING A True Story                                    35. \nCHRISTINE (Cont'd) I thought we had an understanding, I -- (beat) That I was embarrassed isn't the issue, the point is you're wasting time when you should be looking for my son, I -- (beat) Then I want to see this report, so I can refute it, before it goes to anyone else, all right? Fine. \nShe hangs up. Hard. The events of the day have her teetering on the edge, but she's holding on. She pulls herself together and goes to the sink, furiously doing dishes for a silent BEAT before \"Walter\" looks up from his now-empty plate. \n\"WALTER\" I'm finished. Can I go to my room now? \nCHRISTINE Yes.   Go on up. \n\"Walter\" rises, as Christine continues to clean dishes, not looking back at him. Exhausted mentally, physically and emotionally. He goes to the door, stops, turns. \n\"WALTER\" G'night, Mommy. \nChristine fumbles the plate and it SMASHES to the floor.   She turns furiously to \"Walter.\" \nCHRISTINE Stop saying that! I'm not your mother! And you're not my son! She moves toward him, her anger coming out at last. \nCHRISTINE WHO ARE YOU? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME? DAMN YOU! I WANT MY SON BACK! \nHe tears off as she slumps to the floor, covering her eyes. \nCHRISTINE \nI want my son back...god, please... make it stop...just make it stop. \nINT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \n\"Walter\" is in bed, his back to the door, as Christine appears in the hallway. She steps into the room, sits on the bed. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                    36. \nHe doesn't move.   Her voice is soft, but firm. \nCHRISTINE I was wrong to yell at you. You're still a child, and I think you don't really understand what you're doing, the hurt you're causing. Maybe this is all just some big game of pretend to you, but I need you to understand. Walter is...he's all I have, he's everything to me, and every day we lose because of this puts him further away from where I can help him. (beat) Whatever the police think, whatever the world thinks, we know the truth, don't we? We both know you're not Walter. Getting you to admit that may be the only chance I have to straighten this out before it's too late. Maybe you're afraid of getting in trouble, that you're in too deep. But you're not. You don't have to tell me who you are, you just have to tell them who you're not. Just... tell them the truth. \nHe doesn't respond. She gives it a moment in case he might open up, then rises and heads back into the hallway. She switches off the light and heads off down the hallway. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ST. PAUL'S CHURCH - RECTORY - PRE-DAWN \nPastor Briegleb is typing out his sermon for the day. He's exhausted. Looks at the clock. 6:30 a.m. He rubs tiredly at his face when he HEARS the THUMP of the newspaper being delivered. He stands, stretches and steps out to -- \nEXT. ST. PAUL'S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS \n-- where the newspaper is visible on the front lawn. He picks it up and starts into the rectory as he unfolds the paper. \nThen: he slows, stunned by something he's reading.   He looks up again, and hurries back into the rectory. \nINT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN \nShe's in bed, asleep, as the telephone RINGS downstairs. She glances at the clock: 6:45. She clearly doesn't want to go down to answer it...then reluctantly climbs out of bed. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                   37. \nINT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nThe telephone is still ringing as she picks it up. \nCHRISTINE Hello? \nREV. BRIEGLEB (on phone) Is this Mrs. Christine Collins? \nCHRISTINE Yes?   Who is this? \nREV. BRIEGLEB (on phone) My name is Gustav Briegleb, I'm the pastor over at St. Paul's -- \nCHRISTINE Oh, yes, I heard some of your radio broadcasts after my son...you were very supportive, and I appreciate -- \nREV. BRIEGLEB (on phone) Mrs. Collins...have you seen the Times today? \nCHRISTINE No, I -- \nREV. BRIEGLEB (on phone) You'd better take a look. Then come by the parish in an hour for breakfast. I think we should meet. \nShe starts to reply, but the line goes dead. She hangs up the phone, pulls her robe closer around her, and steps out to \nEXT. COLLINS HOME - PRE-DAWN where a copy of the Los Angeles Times sits on a neighbor's front lawn. She looks around, then dashes to pick it up. She unfolds it as she heads back, then abruptly stops. She can't believe what she's seeing. \nCLOSE ON THE NEWSPAPER. The headline reads Mysterious Transformation in Collins Boy. \nCHRISTINE Reverend Briegleb...I appreciate what you're saying, and what you're doing...but I'm not on a mission. The only thing I want is to find my son, that's all, and I just -- \nREV. BRIEGLEB A lot of mothers' sons ended up being sacrificed to expediency around here, Mrs. Collins. Yours wouldn't be the first. Do this right, and maybe yours will be the last. \nShe gets up from the table, paces the garden. \nCHRISTINE If they honestly thought I was wrong, that'd be one thing...but if they don't care, if they're just trying to cover it up.... \nHe picks up the article, waves it. \nREV. BRIEGLEB This is their attempt to win by framing the discussion their way. \"Why, of course it's her son...yes, there have been changes...we're looking into it, and isn't it strange that they happened after the boy got home?\" (beat) They're putting you in the position of having to disprove what they're saying...and that's hard. Most people believe what they hear from the police or the government. If you play it their way, you...and your son...are going to lose. \nShe closes her eyes for a BEAT, then looks to him, her voice firmer, her decision made. \nCHRISTINE What do I have to do? \nCHANGELING A True Story                                     43. \nREV. BRIEGLEB Change the rules of engagement. Re- define the argument. They brought in their expert, so you bring in yours. You have an advantage they don't. You know your son better than they ever will, and in that knowledge is the proof you need. (beat) Get that information, put it out there. Make them respond to you, not the other way around. \nHe gets up, walks toward her, puts his hands on her shoulders. Giving her strength...but also his concern. \nREV. BRIEGLEB Once people side with the police, it's a hard climb...but even in a town as loud as this one, the voice of truth can be heard...if you're willing to take it all the way in spite of the dangers...and they are very real, Mrs. Collins, make no mistake. Once you open the book on these people, you're going to be looking over your shoulder every day, maybe for the rest of your life. (beat) You up to it, Mrs. Collins? \nHe looks in her eyes...and she meets his gaze levelly.   The answer is evident. \nINT. WAITING ROOM - ANGLE ON DOOR - DAY \nWe're in a dentist's office. Christine is waiting for a BEAT before the door opens, and DR. JOHN MONTGOMERY emerges. \nCHRISTINE Well? \nDR. MONTGOMERY He had two cavities that needed filling. He put up a fight, but I took care of it. \nCHRISTINE And...? \nHe casts a look back at the closed door, shakes his head. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                  44. \nDR. MONTGOMERY Your son's upper front teeth were separated by a small muscle. Made them sit about an eighth of an inch apart. The boy in that room has no such gap. \nCHRISTINE Does a gap like that get smaller with age? Because that's what they'll say. \nDR. MONTGOMERY In some cases, yes, it's possible. But the muscle between Walter's teeth prevents that from happening. They can never come together without an operation to sever the muscle, and I can tell you right now that he has never had such an operation. \nCHRISTINE Will you be willing to sign a letter saying that officially? \nDR. MONTGOMERY Pardon my language, but...hell, yes. \nHe hears an OS moan from the inner office. \nDR. MONTGOMERY Sounds like the anesthetic is wearing off. (starts in, pauses) On the other hand, maybe I'll write that letter first. Give the little fella something to think about. He smiles. \nINT. CLASSROOM - MORNING \nSmall, with wooden desks, chalkboard, all the basics. \"Walter\" stands in front of MRS. FOX, fifties, wearing severe glasses and an equally severe expression. Christine stands nearby. \nCHRISTINE Well? What do you think? Is that the Walter Collins that you remember? \nMRS. FOX If it is, he's changed enormously. (to \"Walter\") Do you know who I am? \nCHANGELING A True Story                                     45. \n\"WALTER\" You're a teacher. \nMRS. FOX Yes, but even teachers have names. What's mine? \n\"WALTER\" I don't remember. I know you, but I don't remember your name. \nMRS. FOX My name is Mrs. Fox.   Now, take your seat. \n\"Walter\" hesitates, then takes a seat.    The other kids laugh. \nMRS. FOX I didn't say take a seat. I said take your seat. Your assigned seat. You must know which one it is, you sat there for over a year. \n\"Walter\" tries another vacant seat. There are only three vacant seats in the room. More laughter from the kids. \nMRS. FOX Try again. Here's a hint: There's only one more empty seat left. \nHe sits.   Mrs. Fox looks to Christine. \nMRS. FOX Mrs. Collins, if that's your son, I'll eat my yardstick. Not only will I put that in writing, I'll swear to it in a court of law and in front of President Calvin Coolidge himself if I have to. \nFor the first time, Christine allows a hopeful smile. \nINT. COLLINS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nThe lights are low. Christine sits on the floor, sorting through a box containing artifacts of affection: class projects made by Walter, trees and houses and clay dogs; a heart-shaped card Mother's Day card, hand-made, with I Love You, Mommy carefully printed on the front. She runs her finger over it, tracing the impression left by his pencil. \nShe starts to cry, and a tear falls onto the pencil drawing. She frantically dabs at it, trying to preserve it from distortion...then sets it down and covers her face, weeping. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCHANGELING A True Story                                   46. \nEXT. CITY HALL - MORNING (RAIN) \nThe door opens, and a POLICE MATRON enters. He looks back to Christine, his voice low, his anger replaced by cool determination. This scene is about to take an abrupt change. \nJONES Mrs. Collins...do you still insist that the boy out there is not your son? \nCHRISTINE Yes. \nHe nods to the matron, who moves to restrain her. \nCHRISTINE Wait...what are you doing? \nThe Matron cuffs Christine's hands behind her back. \nMATRON Please don't struggle, ma'am.   You'll only hurt yourself. \nA CLICK, and the handcuffs are in place. \nJONES (to the matron) You are to convey the prisoner to the Los Angeles County General Hospital Psychopathic Ward. \nCHRISTINE No...wait, you can't -- \nJONES (still to matron) Make the following entry in the booking department: Defendant states she has been deceived by police and others, and that they have given her a boy and tried to make her think it is her son when she says it is not. \nEXT. REAR OF POLICE STATION (MONTAGE) \nChristine is led, in handcuffs, into a waiting police van. (VO has been taken verbatim from the police report.) \nCHANGELING A True Story                                      51. \nJONES (V.O.) Mrs. Collins has been known to us since about March 10, 1928, when she reported her nine-year-old son Walter missing. \nINT. VAN \nA stunned and dazed Christine rides in the back of the van \nJONES (V.O.) The boy was gone until July, 1928. Since his return, she has complained that he is still missing, and has made repeated requests that he be found, saying, \"This is not my Walter,\" even though positive identification has been established. \nEXT. LA COUNTY GENERAL HOSPITAL - DAY \nThe police van enters the hospital at 1200 North State Street. \nINT. LA COUNTY GENERAL HOSPITAL - RECEIVING AREA - DAY \nA sterile, dreary, white-on-white place where in the background, we can HEAR the sounds of the insane crying out. The matron leads a stunned Christine to the front desk. \nJONES (V.O.) She suffers from paranoia, delusions of persecution, and dislocation from reality. She may be a threat to herself or others. We recommend that she be conveyed to the psychopathic ward for treatment and observation until her senses can be restored. The matron stops before the desk.   The NURSE barely looks up. \nMATRON Got another code twelve. \nNURSE Name? \nMATRON Collins.   Christine. \nCHRISTINE Wait...please, this is a mistake. \nNURSE (to matron) Certifying officer? \nCHANGELING A True Story                                   52. \nMATRON Captain J. J. Jones, Lincoln Heights division. \nCHRISTINE (forced calm) Please...you have to listen to me. The police are doing this to punish me. They tried to force this boy on me and tell me he was my son, but it wasn't my son, and now they say I'm crazy -- \nShe stops, noting the looks exchanged between the nurse and the matron. Her story sounds insane, even to her. She begins to realize the depth of her predicament. \nCHRISTINE Oh, god...oh god, please, no.... \nNURSE If you continue to struggle I'll have to put you in a straitjacket. Do you want that? (she shakes head) Good. Then behave yourself. (to orderlies) Code twelve. \nThe matron turns Christine over to two large male ORDERLIES, who take her by the arms and lead her into the psycho ward. \nCHRISTINE No, please, you have to listen to me...wait...please! \nThey force-march her down the hall, the screams of the insane growing louder, falling deeper into the nightmare. INT. HOSPITAL - EXAMINING ROOM \nChristine is ushered into the room by a NURSE. \nNURSE Take off your clothes. \nCHRISTINE Why? \nNURSE Physical examination, body cavity search and de-lousing. Required for all new patients. \nThe nurse begins putting on a pair of rubber gloves. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                   53. \nCHRISTINE That's not necessary -- \nNURSE You can remove your clothes yourself, or I can have the orderlies do it for you. Which do you prefer? \nReluctantly, Christine begins to remove her clothes. \nINT. SHOWER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nON CHRISTINE'S FACE as she stands in a spray of water and disinfectant, some coming from the showerhead above, some from a hose sprayed on her by the Nurse in BG. Christine's eyes are closed, trying to shut out the sense of violation. \nNURSE Spread your legs. (a beat) Wider. \nThe Administrator senses that he's sincere, and troubled. \nADMINISTRATOR He's off-duty until tomorrow, but... I'll see what I can do. No promises. \nAnd with that, the administrator heads away. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON \nGordon Northcott is hitch-hiking by the side of the road. A truck approaches, passes him...then slows and stops. Gordon runs up to the truck as the DRIVER leans out. \nDRIVER How far you going? \nGORDON Vancouver. \nDRIVER Hop in. \nGordon climbs into the truck and goes to shove his bag under the seat...when something metallic bangs underneath. He lifts out a short length of metal pipe. DRIVER Don't worry about that, pal. Just a little insurance. A couple of guys tried to hijack my truck a few years ago so they could run booze over the border. You can't be too safe, you know? \nGORDON Yeah, I surely do. \nGordon smiles, moves as if to hand the pipe back...and suddenly SLAMS it DOWN on the Driver's head...over and over and over. Blood splatters his face. Breathing hard, Gordon shoves the Driver out of the truck into the undergrowth then drives off. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                       64. \nINT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - HALLWAY - DAY \nWearing a bandage on one arm, Christine is escorted down the hall by one of the nurses. She's led into -- \nINT. HOSPITAL - STEELE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \n-- where DOCTOR JONATHAN STEELE stands as Christine enters. He's in his fifties, heavy-set, serious. \nSTEELE Mrs. Collins...Dr. Jonathan Steele. Please, have a seat. \nThe nurse leaves. Christine notes that there are three chairs in a row. Could be a test. She sits in the middle chair. Sits as straight as she can. Trying to look sane. \nSTEELE I hope your stay has been comfortable so far. \nCHRISTINE Fine.   Thank you. \nSTEELE Really? I'd think it would be quite difficult at first. \nCHRISTINE (catching herself) Well, it was. Difficult, I mean. But comfortable. \nHe makes a note of this. She grimaces. This isn't going well. He motions to the bandage on her arm. \nSTEELE I see they took a blood test. \nCHRISTINE Wasserman Test. To check for syphilis. Apparently it can affect the mind. \nSTEELE The idea that someone thinks you should be checked for syphilis...did that upset you? \nCHRISTINE No. Not at all. I'm sure it's... standard procedure. \nShe smiles a forced smile.   Trying to appear level-headed. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                  65. \nSTEELE Yes. Exactly. Standard procedure. We have to cover all bases, and -- \nCHRISTINE (covering her bases) But...at the same time...I imagine that it would be...would probably be upsetting to...some people that someone else might...suspect that of them. (beat) However inappropriate that might be. \nShe flashes another wan smile. He makes another note, picks up the report on his desk, glances it over. \nSTEELE According to your file, you believe the police have substituted a fake boy for your son. Is that true? \nCHRISTINE I didn't say they substituted a fake boy, just...not the right boy. (beat) They brought back the wrong boy. Not my son. He's still missing. \nHe starts pulling out papers from his file. \nSTEELE That's strange...you see, I have here a newspaper article with a photo of you at the train station, welcoming your son home. That is you in the photo, isn't it? CHRISTINE Yes. \nSTEELE So at first he was your son, but now he's not your son. (beat) Has this been going on for a long time? People...changing, becoming something other than what they are? \nCHRISTINE People don't change, doctor. \nSTEELE You don't think people change? \nCHANGELING A True Story                                     66. \nCHRISTINE That's not what I -- \nSTEELE And the police...they're not out to persecute you? \nCHRISTINE No.    Of course not. \nSTEELE The police are here to protect us. \nCHRISTINE That's right. \nHe nods. She's trying to say what she thinks he wants to hear. It's a chess match that ends with: \nSTEELE That's odd, because according to the head nurse, when you were admitted you accused the police of conspiring to do this deliberately, to punish you. So either she and the interns are also conspiring against you...or you're changing your story. (beat) Do you often have trouble telling reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins? \nHe sits back.    Christine's face tells the story. \nINT. JUVENILE DETENTION HALL - DAY \nSANFORD (V.O.) We'd go a different direction every time, never hit the same part of town twice. Sometimes we'd go for hours, just driving around, until we found somebody. \nThe truck comes beside the kid and Gordon leans out the window. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                   70. \nSANFORD (V.O.) He'd use all kinds of different stories. Sometimes he'd say he had free tickets for the circus, or he was looking for a lost dog...that one worked real good. Other days -- \nGORDON There you are, we've been looking for you like mad. \nFLASH-IMAGE: to a different kid, a different street. \nKID You have? \nGORDON Sure thing. Your folks, they got in an accident. They sent us to find you. They're hurt real bad. The police took 'em to the hospital, but they didn't have time to come find you, so we said we'd do it. Now come on, hurry...we gotta get to the hospital, see your folks. \nFLASH-IMAGE: Yet another kid, who hesitates, looks to Sanford. \nSANFORD (V.O.) A lot of kids won't get in a car alone with a stranger, but when he's got a kid there with him, that made it easier. (beat) They'd look to me, and figure if I was safe, they would be too. That's why he needed me, see? SANFORD It's okay.     Come on in. \nFLASH-IMAGE: Back to the first kid, who takes one last BEAT, then gets into the car. \nSANFORD (V.O.) Every time they got in the truck, it was like I wanted to die. \nGORDON Good boy! Now hold on, it's a long drive and we gotta fly. \nAnd the truck heads off. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                    71. \nSANFORD (V.O.) Then, as soon as we got back to the ranch...they went in the coop. \nEXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - CHICKEN COOP - NIGHT \nThe boy, crying, is tossed into the chicken coop.   There are two other boys there, also crying and screaming. \nSANFORD (V.O.) Some days he'd do 'em right off. Other days, he'd wait, pick up a few more, keep 'em in the coop until he had like four or five, 'cause -- (beat) -- 'cause he liked to hear 'em scream all at once. Like they were some kinda chorus. And then.... \nQUICK IMAGES \nGordon, eyes insane with blood lust, stumbles toward the coop. \nSANFORD (V.O.) ...and then.... \nThe kids, screaming. \nSanford looking on, afraid to move, the single overhead light in the coop swinging wildly. \nGordon grabbing an ax.    Raising it. \nOn Sanford's eyes, terrified. \nThe ax begins to fall in SLOW MOTION and -- \nBACK TO SCENE -- as the long ash at the end of Ybarra's cigarette, TUMBLES to the floor in SLOW MOTION, end over end, SHATTERING when it hits the floor and bringing us back to full speed. \nSANFORD Sometimes...sometimes he'd leave one or two of 'em alive...barely anyway...and tell me...finish 'em. Finish 'em...or I'll finish you. (beat) And I did...I did...oh god...oh, sweet Jesus...I killed 'em...I killed 'em...I killed 'em.... \nThen: silence, except for Sanford's sobbing. Ybarra realizes he hasn't been breathing. He tries to find his voice. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                     72. \nYBARRA These...uhm...these kids...do you think...if you saw them again, do you think you'd recognize them? (sanford nods) Just a second. \nHe goes to his coat and pulls out a batch of photos of missing kids bound with a rubber band. Hands it to Sanford. \nYBARRA I haven't updated these in a while, but still, it should be.... (beat) Just go through...and if you see any faces you recognize, put it on the table. \nSanford takes the photos.   Starts going through them. \nA photo, a face, goes down on the table. Then another. A third. With each photo slapped down the SLAP gets louder, BOOMING at us. Another photo. Another. Row after row. He's crying, sobbing, but still putting down photos. \nThen he SLAMS down the last one and   half-falls, half-stumbles out of his chair, sobbing...goes to   the corner of the room and slides down the wall until he's   sitting in a fetal position, hands covering his face.    Sobbing uncontrollably. \nNumb, Ybarra goes to the table, picks up a photo. Looks at it. Turns it over to the name, then picks up another. Then a third. When he picks up the fourth photo and turns it over, he stops, staring at it. \nYBARRA ...shit.... The name on the back of the photo is WALTER COLLINS. \nJONES (V.O.) He's lying. \nINT. JONES' OFFICE - DAY \nJones is on the phone, pissed and getting more pissed by the moment. INTERCUT between Jones and Ybarra in juvenile hall during the conversation. \nJONES Have you gone soft in the head, Les? \nYBARRA Sir, I -- \nCHANGELING A True Story                                      73. \nJONES He's playing you! He knows he's in trouble, so he's come up with some cock and bull story about how he was forced to stay in the country -- \nYBARRA With all due respect, sir, I don't think so. You didn't see him, the kid's scared half out of his mind -- \nJONES He picked the Collins kid! We found him, remember? Haven't you been reading the papers? (beat) Or maybe you have, is that it? \nHe backhands a newspaper on his desk, headlined DISTRAUGHT MOTHER CLAIMS POLICE RETURNED WRONG CHILD. \nSTEELE Privacy, please. \nThe orderlies move all of the other patients away, except for Christine, who shares a glance with Carol. Several other orderlies remain. He glances at her chart in his hands. \nSTEELE I see you've still been refusing medication, requiring force-feeding. I see they switched to a rubber tube. I hear that can quite uncomfortable. \nShe doesn't answer. Her eyes never leave his.     He pulls another copy of the letter out of the folder. \nSTEELE Six days, Mrs. Collins, and no progress. We may have to go to more...strenuous therapies. (beat) Unless you're willing to prove you're doing better...by signing this. \nHe holds it up in front of her. She focuses first on it, then on him...and finally, her spine where it needs to be even if the rest of her is in shambles, looks at him and says: \nCHANGELING A True Story                                    83. \nCHRISTINE Fuck you....and the horse...you rode in on. \nHe nods, shrugs, puts the letter back in the folder.   Turns to the orderlies. \nSTEELE Room eighteen. \nThey GRAB her and start muscling her down the hall, Christine kicking and screaming as they go. Steele continues out to \nINT. HOSPITAL - RECEIVING AREA - MOMENTS LATER \nwhere he comes through the double-barred door just as Gustav Briegleb charges in the front door, carrying a newspaper. \nBRIEGLEB I WANT TO TALK TO SOMEBODY IN CHARGE! RIGHT NOW! \nNURSE Sir, please -- \nBRIEGLEB WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE! \nSteele approaches. \nSTEELE I'm head doctor on duty.   What's the problem? \nBRIEGLEB You the doctor who's got Christine Collins locked up in here? Intercut with: \nINT. ROOM EIGHTEEN - CONTINUOUS \nThey wheel Christine into the room, struggling, fighting against the straps that pin her to the gurney. \nINT. HOSPITAL - RECEIVING AREA - CONTINUOUS \nSteele turns away from Briegleb, unconcerned. \nSTEELE Sorry, we don't discuss our cases with anyone other than family -- \nBRIEGLEB You'll damned well discuss this one with me! \nCHANGELING A True Story                                       84. \nSTEELE Sir -- \nBriegleb THRUSTS the newspaper into Steele's hands. \nBRIEGLEB Read it!   Read it, damn you! \nSteele unfolds the paper, looks at the headline, which we don't see. His reaction, though, is ominous and serious. \nINT. ROOM EIGHTEEN - CONTINUOUS \nThe nurse behind Christine applies the conductor jell to her temples. She's fighting the best she can, but it's hopeless. The nurse picks up the electro-shock pincers. Places them on Christine's temples. Reaches for the button -- \n-- as suddenly the door opens, and a nurse steps in, stopping the process. The nurse goes to the one at the controls, whispers in her ear. The nurse then says something quietly to the orderly, who starts to undo the straps that hold Christine to the gurney. \nNURSE The doctor wants to see you. \nThey pull her up off the gurney. \nINT. HOSPITAL - STEELE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nChristine is ushered inside, where Steele is waiting.    He looks upset about something. \nSTEELE Mrs. Collins. \nShe forces herself to stand straight, not easy given what she's just been through. He approaches. \nSTEELE One last time. Are you, or are you not, prepared to sign that letter? \nShe looks up into his face, her resolve unshaken, her voice dry but firm for: \nCHRISTINE No. \nHe studies her for one last BEAT, then turns his back. \nSTEELE You're free to go. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                      85. \nChristine takes a moment to process this...not sure if she heard this right, or if it's a trick. \nCHRISTINE ...what? \nSTEELE Your clothes are in the next room. You can change there. \nShe hesitates a second, looks to the orderly, being careful in case this is a set-up. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                     89. \nJONES (Cont'd) There were four other photos of missing boys that looked a lot like him...this Clark kid could have been mistaken. \nDAVIS Maybe he was...which raises the obvious question: so what? \nJONES Sir? \nDavis turns back to him from the window. \nDAVIS The Mayor wants this to go away. I want this to go away. The way you do that is to stop insisting that Walter Collins was not among those kids killed up at that goddamned ranch. Because if the boy you brought back isn't Walter Collins, and he's not dead up at that ranch, then where the hell is he? People will want to know why we haven't found him. Why we aren't we doing our job. (beat) But if, on the other hand, he is, or could be among those poor boys killed up in Wineville...then the inquiries stop. It's a momentary embarrassment that you'll have to live with...but better a short inconvenience than a lingering problem, wouldn't you say, Captain? Jones doesn't like it, but he swallows his pride.   Nods. \nJONES Yes, sir. \nDAVIS The boy's been gone for nearly a year. If he was going to be found, it would've happened by now. Whether he was up at that ranch or not, the truth is he probably is dead somewhere. Better his mother accepts that now rather than later, don't you think? \nJONES Yes, sir. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                   90. \nDAVIS Good.    That'll be all, Captain. \nJones starts to leave, then looks back as Davis settles back behind his desk. \nJONES Sir, there's talk of an investigation by the police commission. \nDAVIS Let me worry about the commission. But it wouldn't hurt to find out just who the fuck that kid is you brought back from De Kalb and why he did this, because the press bought into his bullshit same as we did. That we were all taken in by the scheming little bastard may help take some of the sting off this. \nJONES My boys are working on it now, sir. \nAnd he exits as we go to \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY \nDetective Ybarra is sitting on one side of a table, a notepad in front of him, staring across at \"Walter,\" who isn't very happy right now, and is staring back with substantial venom. His true, nasty personality is free to come out at last. There's a long BEAT, then: \n\"WALTER\" I want a glass of water. \nYBARRA Tough. \n\"WALTER\" (mocking) \"Tough!\" \nYBARRA What's your name? \n\"WALTER\" Walter Collins. \nYBARRA Walter Collins is dead. \n\"WALTER\" (shrugs) I didn't do it. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                   91. \nYBARRA Look, let me explain something to you. Because of your lies, you've ruined a woman's life embarrassed the police department, and got the whole city up in arms over this. \n\"Walter\" considers this for a BEAT, then smiles. \n\"WALTER\" Got a lot done, didn't I? \nYbarra exchanges a look with the matron, then closes up his notepad. \nYBARRA All right, if that's how you want it, then I guess we're done here. (to matron) Tell County Jail we're remanding him for trial. \n\"WALTER\" Wait...what's remanding?    What trial? \nYBARRA I told you, the real Walter Collins was murdered. \n\"WALTER\" So? I didn't do anything! I wasn't even here when it happened! \nYBARRA By pretending to be Walter Collins, you're interfering in a police investigation of a kidnapping and murder. We can try you as an accomplice to murder after the fact. (beat) Too bad. County Jail is a lot worse than juvenile hall or a foster home. A lot worse. \n\"WALTER\" You can't do that...I'm just a kid! \nYBARRA Sanford Clark is a kid, too. Fifteen. But he's going to jail. All murderers and their accomplices go to jail. Everyone knows that. (to the matron) Get him out of here. It's out of my hands now. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                   92. \nHe heads for the door when \"Walter\" cries out, scared. \n\"WALTER\" Wait!   I don't want to go to jail. \nYBARRA Prove it. \nAnd on the boy's face, we HEAR: \nYBARRA (V.O.) Arthur Hutchins. \nINT. JONES' OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nYbarra is standing in the doorway to Jones' office, speaking to the Captain and looking at his notepad. \nYBARRA The boy's real name is Arthur Hutchins Junior, age twelve, a runaway from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. \nJONES Did you check the wire services? \nYbarra holds up a missing persons sheet. \nYBARRA Checks out. The report was filed by his divorced mother, who lives in Clinton, Iowa with the boy's grandmother. Apparently he didn't like living with the old lady, she didn't let him get away with the stuff he usually got away with, and one day...he up and left. JONES What about the man he showed up with at the diner? \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nBob quietly lets the Mounties in. They signal for Bob to get the hell out of there. Guns in hand, they climb the stairs. \nSuddenly there's the SOUND of breaking glass from above. They race up the stairs to find the window broken, and Gordon fleeing across an adjoining rooftop. \nMOUNTIE Go around the other side!    Cut him off! \nThe others take off as he and another Mountie climb through the broken window in pursuit of Northcott. \nEXT. ROWHOUSES - NIGHT \nGordon races up one rooftop, over the top, then leaps to the next one as, below, Mounties race to keep up with him, WHISTLES blowing furiously. He looks behind him to see the other two Mounties running rooftop to rooftop, coming fast. \nGordon runs faster, going at angles to put more distance between himself and the police on the ground...and making increasingly more difficult and dangerous leaps from rooftop to rooftop. \nHe leaps across one chasm, barely makes it, keeps running. The rooftop Mounties follow. One of them makes the jump successfully, but the other falls short, plummeting to the ground three stories below. A leg snaps on impact. The first Mountie hesitates, looks down. The second one waves him on. \nSECOND MOUNTIE Go on!   Get the bastard! \nHe nods and continues the chase. Gordon runs for all he's worth.    The Mountie keeps after him. \nGordon makes another leap. The Mountie jumps...but he's short. He grabs onto a rain gutter. Gordon sees his situation, runs back, and STOMPS on the Mountie's hands, trying to get him to shake loose. The gutter starts to tear free -- \n-- when a Mountie down below FIRES at Gordon, making him back off. The Mountie clinging to the gutter starts to fall, then grabs a nearby pipe and crawls up to the roof. Keeps coming. \nGordon keeps running...but comes to a chasm too wide to be jumped. He hesitates, starts to cut back in another direction -- \n-- when the Mountie TACKLES him hard. The two go down in a tangle of limbs, fighting, punching, kicking. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                   97. \nThey SLIDE down the steeply angled roof and barely avoid going over the edge. \nWith nowhere else to run, Gordon fights for all he's got, the punches from both coming fast and furious. Finally, the Mountie backs off just a bit -- \nMOUNTIE Screw this...I'm too old for this fightin' shit.... \n-- and DIVES at Gordon, taking them both off the edge of the two-story roof and DOWN into -- \n-- a garden below, CRASHING through carefully manicured flowers and trees to land with a THUD, the Mountie's impact cushioned by Gordon. \nAs the other Mounties come on the run, the first one staggers to his feet and yanks up a bruised, bleeding but otherwise intact Gordon. Looks at him nose-to-nose. \nMOUNTIE YOU...ARE UNDER...ARREST! \nAnd he YANKS Gordon toward the other waiting officers. \nINT. CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - DAY \nChristine opens the door to find Reverend Briegleb and another man on her porch, S. S. HAHN, late fifties. \nBRIEGLEB Mrs. Collins, I want you to meet a friend of mine, Mr. Hahn. \nCHRISTINE Hello. HAHN Mrs. Collins. My deepest condolences on your loss. \nREV. BRIEGLEB Can we come in? \nCHRISTINE Yes...of course. \nShe steps aside to let them in, closing the door under: \nCHRISTINE Mr. Hahn, was it? \nHAHN Yes. \nCHANGELING A True Story                          98. \nCHRISTINE I appreciate the sentiment, but so far they still haven't positively identified any of the...remains... as Walter's. \nHAHN But he was identified, was he not? \nCHRISTINE Yes, but...I guess I still can't accept it. It doesn't feel real to me. \nHAHN It never does. I lost a daughter to polio five years ago. There's not a day goes by I don't think, I should mention this to Claudine... then I remember she's not here. \nCHRISTINE I'm sorry.     Please, sit. \nThey do as Christine looks to Briegleb. \nCHRISTINE I've been on the phone all day with the appointment secretary for the police commission. They won't let me testify at the hearing, or call witnesses. They say it's not necessary. \nREV. BRIEGLEB I know. My sources tell me the police commission is going to come out with a report that whitewashes the whole thing. They're going to say that Jones and the rest of the LAPD did absolutely nothing wrong, that the real blame is with the kid...and with you, for being difficult and forcing them to put you away for your own safety. \nCHRISTINE Then we'll just have to hire a lawyer...bring a civil suit and try to get the City Council to call for a hearing by the Welfare Board. \nREV. BRIEGLEB Jut one problem. (more) \nCHANGELING A True Story                                    99. \nREV. BRIEGLEB (Cont'd) Not one lawyer outside this room was willing to take on the Police Department. Too risky, they said. So finally I went to the very best attorney in town, a man who's sued the city four times and won. Unfortunately, we could never afford to hire him. \nCHRISTINE (crestfallen) I see.... \nHAHN Which is why I'm doing this pro bono. (a smile) It would be my honor to defend your honor, Mrs. Collins. In my fifteen years as a lawyer, I have never seen anyone fight as long or as hard as you have, in what is so clearly in the cause of justice. \nREV. BRIEGLEB Now I want you to tell Mr. Hahn here the whole story, from end to end, leave nothing out, he'll need it all if he's going to get the City Council involved. \nREPORTER What's the charge, Chief? \nCHIEF DAVIS The charge is conduct unbecoming an officer, and using improper and abusive language toward Mrs. Collins. It further charges that he exceeded his authority as a police officer by incarcerating Mrs. Collins on the alleged charge of insanity without sufficient cause. \nREPORTER Mayor Cryer, are you aware that the City Council has said it plans to open its own investigation into the Collins case? \nMAYOR CRYER I've heard this, yes. But since one of the main purposes of such a hearing by the City Council would be to suspend Captain Jones, and since that action has now been taken, the question is moot. \nREPORTER Which makes it look like the only reason Jones is being suspended is to head off the City Council (more) \nCHANGELING A True Story                                    104. \nREPORTER (Cont'd) investigation. Are you concerned that an outside investigation might go uncomfortably high up the food chain? \nCHIEF DAVIS I won't even dignify that question with a response. Good day. \nThe two head back into \nINT. CITY HALL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nGlancing back over their shoulders at the press outside. \nCRYER Cheer up, Chief. That little show should take the wind out of their sails. By Monday, this issue will be as cold as yesterday's fish. Never underestimate the public's lack of attention and potential for apathy. Old news is dead news, you'll see. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nShe opens the door as Briegleb enters with three really large, dangerous looking men, one of whom is carrying a heavy trench coat. \nCHRISTINE Reverend, what -- \nBRIEGLEB Sorry to barge in so late, Mrs. Collins, but it took me a while to find the right people for the right job. These three gentlemen are members of my congregation who, before coming to the Lord, had lived lives of brutality, vice and crime. Now they are pledged to doing god's work...and if this isn't it, I don't know what is. \nCHRISTINE I don't understand. \nBRIEGLEB People who bring charges against the police have a habit of (more) \nCHANGELING A True Story                                     105. \nBRIEGLEB (Cont'd) disappearing right before the trial. I'm a big believer in the power of prayer, Mrs. Collins...but a little backup from time to time never hurts. \nThe others nod as they make themselves comfortable in the living room. \nCHRISTINE I see...well, I...thank you.   Can I get you anything? \nBRIEGLEB Since we don't plan on sleeping, coffee would be lovely. \nShe heads off to get some coffee. As one of the men puts his coat behind the sofa, we see that it contains a sawed-off shotgun. Briegleb looks out the window, to where a police car sits, watching the house. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - MORNING \nShe's dressed in her best dress, putting on a hat and a pair of gloves. Her hands are shaking. She squeezes them together, closes her eyes. Focuses. With one final, deep breath, she heads out. \nEXT. COLLINS HOME - MORNING \nThe same police car is there as Christine gets into a car with Briegleb and the two drive off. The other three men get into another car and follow. The police car in turn pulls away from the curb, following both cars. EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - BRIEGLEB'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER \nHe's aware that they're being followed, glancing in the rear view mirror to keep an eye on things. Looks over to Christine, smiles encouragingly. Looks ahead. \nBRIEGLEB Traffic's getting heavy.   We'll go up Spring. \nHe turns. The other cars do the same. But the traffic here is even worse. Just then, Briegleb looks back in his rear view mirror to see -- \n-- another police car pulling out of a driveway and cutting off the car with Christine's bodyguards. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                  106. \nBriegleb turns quickly, trying to get ahead, but the street's too busy. He looks in the mirror to see that another police car glide into position two cars behind them. \nTraffic stops. Jammed. Briegleb is nervous, sensing the very real possibility of a hit being set up. The traffic is lined right up against parked cars on either side. Then there's a momentary break in traffic. \nBRIEGLEB Hold on. \nHe turns hard into the driveway of a closed shop and shuts off the engine. Jumps out and opens the door for Christine, who gets out. \nBRIEGLEB Start walking. Quickly. \nThey do. He glances back at the police car. The two inside start to open the doors, but they can't get them open, being right up against parked cars on one side and traffic on the other. They run the siren to clear traffic, but it's too late as -- \n-- Christine and Briegleb hurry down the street on foot, Briegleb glancing behind them. The foot- and car-traffic is very heavy...we HEAR horns honking and, in the distance, something that could be the sound of lots of people. \nREV. BRIEGLEB Almost there. Just a few more blocks. \nCHRISTINE Where is all this traffic's coming from...? Briegleb glances back. The police car has popped its doors, and two trench-coated officers are getting out. Christine stops a man passing in the opposite direction. \nCHRISTINE Excuse me, can you tell me what the problem is up ahead? \nMAN Didn't you hear? It's the biggest protest I've ever seen. \nREV. BRIEGLEB Protest? \nOFFICER Yeah...over that Collins broad, if you can believe that. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                    107. \nThe bailiff forcibly turns him around to face the judge. Christine's hands grip the seat she's in until her knuckles turn white...but she doesn't allow him the satisfaction of seeing her react to his comments. The judge looks up. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                  111. \nJUDGE Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have been charged with three counts of murder in the first degree, with an additional seventeen counts under review by the district attorney's office. How do you plea? \nGORDON Not guilty, your honor. \nHe glances back at his audience.   The bailiff rights him again. \nJUDGE In light of the defendant's penchant for international travel, no bail will be set. This court will receive preliminary motions by tomorrow morning, with a trial date to be set for the earliest opening on the court's calendar. (beat) The defendant is remanded into custody. Bailiff.... \nThe bailiff removes Gordon, who shares one last look with his audience, and Christine in particular. He winks at her. She doesn't give him a flicker of satisfaction with a reaction. But once he's gone, she sits heavily and covers her eyes, fighting tears. Hahn puts a hand on her shoulder, but says nothing. There's nothing to say. \nJONES (V.O.) The boy, Walter Collins, was reported as missing on March 10, 1928. \nINT. CITY COUNCIL ROOM - DAY Jones is at last on the stand. Hahn stands before him, the rest of the City Council, Christine and the huge audience looking on. \nJONES We then instituted a nationwide search. On July 10, we received a cable indicating that a boy matching his description had been found in De Kalb, Illinois. Upon questioning, he admitted to being Walter Collins, and we made arrangements to transport him back to California. \nHAHN Where Mrs. Collins told you the boy was not her son. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                      112. \nJONES Yes. She denied his identity in spite of all evidence pointing to the contrary. \nHAHN But as subsequent events have demonstrated, she was correct. So what prompted you to send her for psychological evaluation? \nJONES Whether or not this was in fact the correct boy was not relevant to my decision. Throughout this period, she acted strangely. She was often cool, aloof and unemotional, especially when presented with the boy we located in De Kalb, and in our subsequent conversations. It was because of her disturbing behavior that I submitted her for observation to the psychopathic ward of Los Angeles County General Hospital. \nHAHN Just like that. You snap your fingers and an innocent woman is thrown into the psycho ward. \nJONES She wasn't -- \nHahn turns away, playing to the council and the audience. \nHAHN Every home in this state is in grave danger when a Police Captain can take a woman into his office and, five minutes later, have her thrown into the psychopathic ward on his own authority! \nThe crowd applauds and cheers.    Joes fights to be heard. \nJONES (over the crowd) She wasn't -- \nHAHN What was that, Captain? \nJONES She wasn't thrown.     She was... escorted. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                    113. \nThere's laughter from the gallery.   He doesn't like it. \nHAHN Escorted, thrown, the verb doesn't matter, Captain. What does matter is that her incarceration was ordered without a warrant. \nHahn goes to the exhibit table, picks up several papers. \nHAHN I am holding a carbon copy of the affidavit of insanity that was issued in the case of the State of California vs. Christine Collins. Who signed the affidavit? \nJONES I did. \nHAHN And what is the date on this document? \nJONES September 12th. \nHAHN But Mrs. Collins was incarcerated on September 6th. \nJONES The form is backdated. \nHAHN Yes, so it would appear. The bottom of the page is reserved for recording where and when the warrant was served. But it has not been filled in. May I assume from this that the warrant was never served? \nJONES That's correct. There was no need to serve the warrant since she was at that time already in custody. \nHAHN Let me see if I have this straight. A woman was thrown into the psychopathic ward without a warrant, because no warrant existed, and when it was finally written six days later, there was no need to sign it or go to a judge because (more) \nCHANGELING A True Story                                      114. \nHAHN (Cont'd) she was already in the asylum!      Is this correct, Captain? \nJONES Technically...yes. \nMore murmuring from the crowd. \nJONES Extraordinary steps were necessary because we were dealing with an extraordinary situation! Is it our fault that we were being deceived by the boy who claimed to be Walter Collins? No. In light of his claims and her behavior, who wouldn't begin to wonder if there was something wrong with her? \nHAHN Because she questioned you. \nJONES Because she wouldn't listen, because she insisted on being obstinate and taking matters into her own hands best left to qualified officers, because -- \nHAHN Because she was fighting for the life of her son! A boy who may have still been alive while you were wasting valuable time denying you had done anything wrong! \nThis silences both Jones and the crowd. You could hear a pin drop. Hahn approaches Jones, and now speaks softly. \nHAHN And in the end, that's what happened, isn't it? At some point, while all this was going on, Walter Collins died along with as many as nineteen other youths on the Northcott Ranch in Wineville. Is that correct, Captain? \nJones looks to Chief Davis.   It's a moment.    Then: \nJONES Yes.   It is. \nChristine's face falls into her hands.   The place erupts. \nShe nods again, and stands. He heads out of the room, and she lingers for a moment, taking one last look around before turning off the night-light, and sees the drawing he made of the two of them walking together beneath an orange sun. HOLD on that image as we HEAR a gavel hammering and: \nTHORPE (V.O.) This meeting will now come to order. \nINT. CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY \nPUSHING IN on Thorpe, at the center of the council's long table, addressing the crowd and Christine. \nTHORPE This Committee has now heard all of the testimony, and in light of the facts presented, issues the following statement. \nINTERCUT WITH \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY Where Northcott stands before the judge, jury, and the grieving family members. \nJUDGE Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict? \nFOREMAN We have, your honor. \nINT. CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS \nStill pushing in. \nTHORPE While the City Council has no power to directly remove commissioners or (more) \nCHANGELING A True Story                                     119. \nTHORPE (Cont'd) the employees who serve under them, it nevertheless can perform the function of making recommendations. This committee therefore reports and recommends: (beat) First, that the majority members of the Police Commission deserve the severest condemnation for their decision to whitewash the Collins case. \nAPPLAUSE erupts from the gallery at this. \nINT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS \nQuietly PUSHING IN on Northcott, the Judge, Jury, others. \nJUDGE Bailiff, will you bring me the verdict of the jury? \nThe bailiff complies. The judge reads it, hands it back to the Bailiff, who brings it back to the Foreman. \nINT. CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS \nAs before. \nTHORPE Second, we recommend that the suspension of Captain Jones be made permanent. \nEven louder applause, some cheering. The pattern continues through the balance of the statement. INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS \nFavoring Northcott. \nJUDGE Will the defendant please rise? \nNorthcott rises, still smiling, defiant. \nINT. CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS \nAs before. \nTHORPE Third, that steps be taken to investigate a change in the prevailing laws and procedures by (more) \nCHANGELING A True Story                                 120. \nTHORPE (Cont'd) which a citizen of this city can be subjected to incarceration in the county's mental facilities. (beat) Finally, restoration of public confidence in the police department can only be achieved by the removal of its chief of police, and this committee so recommends. (beat) This hearing is concluded. \nThe place explodes with cheers. \nINT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAs the foreman stands again. \nJUDGE You may read the verdict. \nFOREMAN We the jury find the defendant, Gordon Stewart Northcott...guilty on all counts of murder in the first degree. \nThere are gasps and cries and tears...but Northcott is defiant. \nJUDGE Does the defendant wish to make a statement before judgment is passed? \nGORDON Yeah, I want to make a statement. I want to make it real clear that I never once got a fair shake from you, your \"honor,\" or this court. The only one of you here worth a goddamn is her -- (points to christine) -- 'cause she's the only one never badmouthed me to the press. She understands what it is when the police frame you for something you didn't do and throw you in the hole. Isn't that right? \nHe looks to her.   She doesn't flinch. \nGORDON I want you to know, Mrs. Collins, I never killed your boy. I -- \nCHANGELING A True Story                                     121. \nJUDGE That's enough! Counsel, you will get control of your client or I will have him bound and gagged. \nThe defense attorney yanks Gordon around to face the judge. \nJUDGE Gordon Stewart Northcott, it is the judgment of this court that you will be conveyed to San Quentin Prison, where you will be held in solitary confinement for a period of two years, until October 2nd, 1930. On that date, you are to be hanged by the neck until dead. May god have mercy on your soul. \nAnd he brings down the gavel. \nEXT. COUNTY COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON \nChristine is standing outside, putting the horrors of the day out of her thoughts, as a door opens and Chief Davis comes out, followed by several reporters. \nCHIEF DAVIS -- no, as I said after the hearing, I have every intention of finishing my term as Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department. I will not resign. I will fight to the finish. The Collins case was merely an excuse for certain politicians who have been trying to have me removed for some time, and I -- \nGORDON That's where they do it, you know. That building right over there. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                  125. \nCHRISTINE That's where they do what? \nGORDON The hangings. Ten o'clock tonight, I get to see what's inside. I hear there's thirteen steps going up to the gallows...'cause thirteen is unlucky. Helps make sure you're gonna go to hell when you die. But I got 'em beat. I outsmarted 'em. \nHe looks to Christine, smiles nervously, glances back out the window. \nGORDON They're gonna let me have whatever I want for dinner. Got a steak coming, with spinach, mashed potatoes and green beans. I always wondered why they did that whole last meal thing. One of the other guys on Death Row said when you take the drop, you foul yourself, and everything you ate...comes out the other end. So maybe that's why they make sure you got something in you when it happens. They like knowing you fouled yourself on the way to -- \nHe stops himself.   Turns from the window. \nGORDON Sure you don't got a cigarette? \nShe shakes her head.   He nods absently for a moment. GORDON The warden, Clinton Duffy, he's a good guy. He's writing a book about all the death sentences he's carried out in this place. Says it's called \"Eighty-Eight Men and Two Women.\" Beats my record all to hell. \nCHRISTINE Mr. Northcott...you asked me to come to see you. You said if I did, you would tell me the truth about my son. Well, I'm here. \nGORDON Yeah...yeah, you are. But see, the thing is, I didn't think you'd really come, and now -- \nCHANGELING A True Story                                  126. \nHe's pacing, growing more agitated and scared. \nCHRISTINE Now what? \nGORDON I didn't expect.... (beat) I don't want to see you. \nCHRISTINE What? \nGORDON I can't do this...I can't talk to you...not today, not tonight, not with what they're going to do to me. It's one thing to send a telegram, that's easy, but right now, right here, in person, I -- (beat) I can't tell you what you want to hear, Mrs. Collins. I can't, I can't -- \nCHRISTINE Why not? \nGORDON Because I don't want to die with a lie on my lips! \nHe turns from her, in anguish...but is he just playing her? \nGORDON I did my penance, I asked God to forgive me for my sins...and I've been good, ever since...if I commit a sin now, if I lie now...I'm out of time, I can't be forgiven again... I don't want to go to hell -- \nShe goes around to him, faces him. \nCHRISTINE Mr. Northcott...look at me. (beat) Look at me. \nHe turns almost against his will...meets her eyes. \nCHRISTINE Did you...kill...my son? \nHis eyes go wide and he CRIES OUT, stumbling back and away from her. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                    127. \nGORDON Get away from me...I don't know anything about it! \nCHRISTINE Mr. Northcott -- \nGORDON I'm innocent! (pounds door) Guard! Guard! \nThe guard enters, going to Northcott. \nCHRISTINE No, wait, please -- \nPRISON GUARD It's okay, ma'am, they always get a little nuts the day of. \nShe pushes past him to Northcott, grabs the front of his shirt. \nCHRISTINE Did you kill him? Did you kill my son? \nHe screams in anguish, and the guard hauls him out, closing the door after him. Christine tries to open the door, but it won't open. \nCHRISTINE Mr. Northcott...Mr. Northcott! \nShe slowly slides to the floor, crying as we HEAR the SOUND of CHAINS clanking, and we.... \nDISSOLVE TO: INT. EXECUTION AREA - NIGHT \nThe door to the prison yard opens and closes as Northcott is led into the area with the scaffolding. The Warden is there, waiting at the foot of the gallows, along with a chaplain. \nSeveral other parents, including Mr. and Mrs. Clay, are in the witness gallery at the back, separated from the gallows area by a large plate glass window. Christine is among the parents. The Clays see her, and put a hand on her arm for strength. Christine nods, accepting it, and moves to one side. \nNorthcott, legs and arms bound in chains, makes his way to the warden at the base of the gallows. A clock reads 9:50. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                  128. \nWARDEN Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have been found guilty of murder, the penalty for which is death by hanging. There have been no stays or reprieves, therefore the execution will go forward as stipulated under the laws of the State of California. Do you have any last words? \nGORDON No...nothing. (to chaplain) I kept clean after I confessed, reverend...just like I said I would. \nThe chaplain nods silently as the warden looks to the guards, who begin to escort Northcott up the steps to the gallows. \nGORDON Will it...will it hurt? (no reply) Please...not so fast...don't make me walk so fast! \nThey struggle with him now, pushing and carrying him up the last of the thirteen steps to the top. They tie his legs together, and cinch his arms tightly in place. \nGORDON Thirteen steps...thirteen steps... but I didn't touch all of 'em, you bastards...I didn't touch all of 'em! \nCHANGELING A True Story                                  132. \nCHRISTINE Ben, it looks like dinner is on me, I -- \nShe stops.   It's not Ben on the phone. \nCHRISTINE Yes, this is she. Mrs. Clay? No, of course I remember you, how are you? Is everything -- \nShe freezes at something she hears. \nCHRISTINE When? Where did they -- (beat) No, of course...I'll be right there. \nShe hangs up, grabs her coat, and races out the door. \nEXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nChristine climbs out of a taxi and rushes into the station. \nINT. INTERVIEW ROOM - VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nChristine is ushered into a room with a long two-way mirror that looks out into an interview room. Mr. and Mrs. Clay are already there. In the other room is Detective Ybarra, and a young boy, DAVID, age 13. Mrs. Clay sees her, and they embrace. \nMRS. CLAY I wanted to go to him right off, but they said it was important to talk to him alone first. \nCHRISTINE Are they sure it's -- \nMRS. CLAY They're sure, but more important, I'm sure. (beat) It's my boy, all right...it's David. He's alive, Christine. They found him up in Hysperia. \nCHRISTINE But how -- \nMr. Clay motions for them to shush. They turn their attention to the other room, where Ybarra looks up from making notes. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                     133. \nYBARRA All right, so after you got into the car, what happened next? \nDAVID They drove me around for a long time, then we ended up at this ranch -- \nEXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - FLASHBACK - NIGHT \nDavid is shoved into the chicken coop. Several other BOYS are already there, scared, crying. They lunge at the door, trying to get out, but it slams shut in their faces. \nThey scream, trying to get out.   Gordon SLAMS an arm against the door, scaring them. \nGORDON SHUT UP! (grinning) I'll see you boys later.... \nHe laughs and moves off, Sanford accompanying him, looking very guilty. \nYBARRA (V.O.) Were there other boys present? \nDAVID (V.O.) Yeah...six, I think. It was a long time ago. \nYBARRA (V.O.) Did you speak to them? Do you remember any of their names? \nINT. CHICKEN COOP - LATER PANNING the boys huddled against one wall, scared. \nDAVID (V.O.) Yeah...two of them were brothers, I think their last name was Winslow, something like that. The oldest was Jeffrey, I think he was around eleven.... (beat) ...and Walter. \nWe STOP PAN on the last kid...on Walter Collins, at last. \nINT. INTERVIEW ROOM - VIEWING ROOM \nAs Christine REACTS to this, her hand flying to her mouth. Not daring to breathe. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                    134. \nYBARRA Walter. \nDAVID Yeah. \nYBARRA Do you remember his last name? \nDAVID Collins. \nChristine covers her face.     Can barely stand up. \nYBARRA So if you only remember some of the names of the rest, how come you remember his full name? \nDAVID Because of what happened. \nINT. CHICKEN COOP - NIGHT \nTwo of the kids, Walter and Jeffrey, are sitting in a corner, talking quietly, urgently. \nDAVID (V.O.) Walter and Jeffrey were talking when everybody else was screaming. They were scared, same as the rest of us, but they weren't scared stupid.

Boys his age don't shrink. If anything, he should be taller. \nJONES Maybe your measurements are off. Look, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for -- \nCHRISTINE He's circumcised. Walter wasn't. \nJones glances back, uncomfortable about discussing circumcision with a woman in public view. He lowers his voice. \nJONES Mrs. Collins...your son was missing for four months. For at least part of that in the company of an as-yet unidentified drifter. Who knows what such a disturbed individual might have done? He could have had him...circumcised... might have -- \nCHRISTINE Made him smaller? Captain, please -- \nHe's on the move again, stepping into -- INT.

That's why he needs your support and love to bounce back. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                       29. \nCHRISTINE Captain, that boy wouldn't bounce back as my son if you coated him in rubber and dropped him off the roof. \nHe sits, shaking his head. \nJONES Why are you doing this, Mrs. Collins? You seem perfectly capable of taking care of the boy, your work pays you enough to attend to his personal needs...so I don't understand why you're trying to run away from your responsibilities -- \nCHRISTINE I'm not running away from anything, least of all my responsibilities. I'm even taking care of that boy because right now I'm all he has. What worries me is that you've stopped looking for Walter. \nJONES Why should we look someone we've already found? \nCHRISTINE But you haven't found him. He's still out there somewhere, lost, maybe hurt.... \nJONES His identity has been confirmed by the best minds in the field of child identification, people who know what they're doing.

COLLINS HOME - DAY \nChristine is cooking dinner when the doorbell rings. She opens the door to find a police officer and DR. EARL W. TARR, sixties, mildly eccentric in appearance. \nDR.

May I come in? \n", "test1_true": "She steps aside, and Dr. Tarr enters, looking around. \nCHRISTINE Thank you for coming. I'm surprised Captain Jones moved so quickly. I was starting to think he didn't believe me. \nDR. TARR Well, I'm here now, and we'll put all that to rights. Where is the boy? \nHe looks up as \"Walter\" comes downstairs. Noting that he said \"the boy,\" not \"your son,\" Christine looks relieved. \nDR. TARR Ah! There he is. A handsome young man. He has your eyes, doesn't he? And a little bit of the nose. Very fit, in spite of all his travails. A very resilient boy you've got here, Mrs. Collins. As he bends down to look more closely at \"Walter,\" Christine stiffens...she can't have heard that right. \nCHRISTINE Doctor Tarr, I thought you were here to help me. \nDR. TARR I am. Captain Jones said the boy had gone through some extreme physical changes, and asked me to look in on him...to reassure you in this your time of motherly concern. \nCHRISTINE My \"motherly concern\" isn't for him because he's not my son. \nCHANGELING A True Story                           31. \nDR. TARR Statements like that will hardly help the boy's self-esteem, now will they? (beat) Captain Jones said something about a change in height...? \nCHRISTINE He's four inches shorter than -- \nDR. TARR Ah, well...hardly a mystery, Mrs. Collins. We've known for some time that trauma can affect the growth of children. Given the stress of the last four months his spine may have actually shrunk. It's uncommon, but within the realm of possibility. \nCHRISTINE What about the circumcision? \nDR. TARR Very likely his abductor thought it appropriate. After all, circumcision is hygienically sound. Must have been quite traumatic at the time. No wonder he's submerged the memory. \nCHRISTINE Look, doctor -- \nDR. TARR As you can see, there's a perfectly sound medical explanation for all of this. But it's good for you to raise these questions. You should be apprised of all changes the lad went through during his absence. \nCHRISTINE Wouldn't I know whether or not he was my son? I'm his mother. \nDR. TARR Which means you're in no position to be objective. You are looking through the prism of extreme emotion at a boy who has changed from what you remember. He isn't the same boy that left here, just as a boy who goes off to war and returns isn't the same anymore. (more) \nCHANGELING A True Story                                    32. \nDR. TARR (Cont'd) A mother's heart, driven by intuition and emotion rather than logic, sees these changes and rebels, insists that this cannot be your son. But that doesn't change the facts. (beat) I'm willing to put my theory to the test of objectivity, Mrs. Collins... are you? \nCHRISTINE What're you -- \nBefore she can react, he takes Walter by the hand and leads him outside. Christine follows them out to -- \nEXT. COLLINS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \n-- as Dr. Tarr strides onward, the police officer and \"Walter\" walking alongside as Christine brings up the rear. A few houses down they come to a group of CHILDREN playing. \nDR. TARR Hello, children, my name is Dr. Earl W. Tarr. I'd like to ask you some questions. \n1ST KID My mom says we're not supposed to talk to strangers. \nDR. TARR Good boy. Quite right. But as you see I'm with the police, so it's all right. Now, I'm sure you know Mrs. Collins here, and her son, Walter. How many of you recognize this young boy as Walter Collins? \nHe looks from one child to the other. They don't reply. Either they don't recognize him, or they're intimidated. \nDR. TARR Now, now, no need to be afraid. Surely you knew Walter, and played with him? So which of you can identify Walter for me, for his mother, and for the police? This officer would want you to do the right thing as good young citizens. \nThe kids exchange a glance. It's clear they don't recognize the boy, but they're intimidated by the presence of Tarr and the police officer. A few reluctantly raise their hands. Another of them goes to \"Walter,\" who is shorter than he is. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                   33. \n2ND KID Walter was as tall as me.... \nDR. TARR Yes, precisely. He was as tall as you. Now he's not. He's lost a little height, you see. It's a thing called trauma. With luck, none of you will ever have to find out about it yourselves. So other than that, do you recognize this as your friend, Walter Collins? \n2ND KID I guess... \nCHRISTINE Dr. Tarr -- \nDR. TARR Already ahead of you, Mrs. Collins; children can be intimidated. But not adults. Shall we try a neighbor? \nHe heads off again, like some very tall, strange bird marching down the street. Christine exchanges a look with the kids, then heads off to follow. \nEXT. RILEY'S HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER \nTarr, Christine, Mrs. Riley, the officer and \"Walter\" stand on the porch. \nDR. TARR -- and we'd appreciate it if you could make a positive identification for us. MRS. RILEY I'd be happy to. I saw the boy often. Come closer, son. \nShe stoops down, studies \"Walter's\" face, turns it from side to side. Squints at him. He squints back at her. Note: she's not wearing glasses. Finally: \nDR. TARR Take your time...be sure. \nMRS. RILEY Oh, yes...yes...that's Walter all right. Used to come here all the time to play with my nephew, Roger. \nCHANGELING A True Story                                   34. \nDR. TARR Thank you, Mrs. Riley.   You've been a big help, I -- \nCHRISTINE Before we go...Mrs. Riley, do you have the time? \nMRS. RILEY Certainly.... \nShe looks at her watch. Holds it farther away. Can't quite focus on it. Pulls her glasses out from inside her blouse. \n", "test2_input": "The door BANGS against the wall. Flies buzz around the place. The kitchen is in shadows, but there's no question it's a mess. Ybarra moves cautiously through the kitchen. No sound except the wood creaking beneath his feet as he enters \nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nOld, musty, shadowed. The ticking of an old grandfather clock. There's no one in sight. Ybarra moves down the hall, glances into two adjoining rooms. Nothing. He continues into \nINT.

They go down in a tumble of limbs, wrestling on the floor as Sanford tries to escape. YBARRA Stop it! Stop it or I'll push your face through the floor! \nBreathing hard, Sanford finally stops struggling.   Ybarra cuffs Sanford's hands behind his back. \nYBARRA On your feet. \nSanford stands, and as Ybarra leads him out, we PAN TO a mantle and a photo that shows Sanford Clark and a man we recognize as the one we saw by the road earlier: Gordon Northcott. \nINT.

We've got a orders to send you back home, and -- \nSuddenly Sanford starts laughing. It's a nearly hysterical laugh, half fear and half relief...Ybarra isn't there for the reasons he thought. Ybarra is puzzled by his reaction. \nYBARRA Didn't know Canada was that funny. \nYbarra puts the car into gear and drives off. \nEXT. ST.

If she's not there, call the LAPD, see what they know. \nThe aide hurries off as Briegleb turns back to the microphone and touches a switch.

The second-hand on a clock behind protective chicken-wire passes 8:00 and a loud BELL goes off, announcing the start of the day. \nWe hear doors being unlocked up and down the hall. Christine stands, pulls her hair back, and catches her reflection in the window: pale, drawn, smudged, and in a hospital gown... looking like someone who actually belongs in this place. \nThe door opens and she steps into the hall as a NURSE passes. \nCHRISTINE Can I see the doctor?

Reluctantly, she begins eating the cold-looking oatmeal. \nCAROL DEXTER My name's Carol Dexter.    What's yours? \nCHRISTINE Christine.     Christine Collins. \nChristine reacts to the taste of the food, which is awful. \nCAROL   DEXTER Finish it all.    I know it's hard, but you have to   try. Lunch isn't as bad. Close,    but not as -- \nCHRISTINE I won't be here that long. As soon as I can talk to a doctor, they'll realize there's been a terrible mistake and -- \nCAROL DEXTER Yeah, that always works. (beat, quieter) I heard them talking. You're here on a code twelve, police action. The doctors, the staff, they figure that if the police sent you here, there must be a good reason for it. \nCHRISTINE Then I'll just have to prove that I'm not insane. \nCAROL DEXTER Yeah? How? The more you try to act sane, the crazier you start to look. If you smile too much, you're delusional or stifling hysteria. If you don't smile, you're depressed. If you're neutral you're emotionally withdrawn and potentially catatonic. \nCHRISTINE You seem to have given this a great deal of thought. \nCAROL DEXTER I have. Don't you get it? You're code twelve. So am I. We're here for the same reason.

(points os) The lady over there was married to a cop who kept beating her up. When she tried to tell somebody, they sent her here. And that one? The police beat the crap out of her brother, broke both his arms. When she complained to the papers, they picked her up and... \nCHRISTINE What about you? \nCAROL DEXTER I...work nights. (Chris doesn't get it) I mean, I work nights. Downtown. In some of the clubs. You know. \nIt gets through.   Hooker.   Christine nods. \nCAROL DEXTER This one client started hitting me, and he wouldn't stop. So I filed a complaint. Turns out he was a cop. Next thing I know, I'm here. \nCHRISTINE But how can they -- \nCAROL DEXTER You're kidding right? Hey, everybody knows women are fragile, right? They're all emotions, no logic, nothin' goin' on upstairs. And sometimes, like when they say something that's a little, y'know, inconvenient...they just go fucking nuts, pardon my French. If we're insane, nobody has to listen to us. I mean, who are you going to believe, some crazy woman trying to destroy the integrity of the force, or a police officer?

Sanford emerges. \nYBARRA All right.     Show me. \nSanford hesitates, then starts toward a nearby barn. \nINT. BARN - CONTINUOUS \nHe slides the door open and walks to the far end. The dirt here is a strange white-yellow color. Ybarra follows, still keeping a wary eye out for trouble. He looks down at where Sanford has stopped. Several bags marked LYE are nearby. \nYBARRA This it?   You're sure? \nSanford nods.   Ybarra edges toward a shovel, hands it to him. \nYBARRA Dig. (off sanford's look) You put 'em in the ground, you can take 'em out of the ground. Go on. \nSanford takes the shovel and starts cutting out sections of dirt and lye, dust rising around them. Ybarra watches, pensively, as the other officers edge their way in. He's looking the other way when one of the officers reacts: \nOFFICER Holy god.... \nYbarra glances back...to see a child's shoe being unearthed. And beside it...bones. And then...a skull. \nYBARRA Call it in...get the coroner and every officer in a twenty mile radius here inside the hour. (more) \nCHANGELING A True Story                                      82. \nYBARRA (Cont'd) Then put out an APB on Gordon Stewart Northcott, the info is in my car. Go on.... \nThe officer races out of the barn as Ybarra looks to Sanford, who is still digging, crying as he goes. \nYBARRA You can stop now, son. (he doesn't) You can stop now. It's over. We can take it from here. It's over. \nSobbing, Sanford drops the shovel and collapses on the ground, hands covering his face, crying in great, heaving sobs. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - HALLWAY - MORNING \nThe patients are lined up outside their rooms for inspection. Steele passes down them in review. Stops in front of Christine, who looks exhausted, worn, pale, her eyes bloodshot...but still defiant. He glances to the orderlies. \n"}

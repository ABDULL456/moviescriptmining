Berlin is pulling David into her. They approach a climax. 
She scratches him on the small of the back. Blood trickles. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
The MUSIC and dancers are in pure FRENZY. Suddenly, the MUSIC STOPS. Greer stands by the STEREO, his hand coming back from the power button. He gestures "that's-all-folks." 
INT. BATHROOM 
David and Berlin stand still and apart, breathing heavily into the reality-inducing silence. He looks at her in the mirror, a look of shame. She gives him an odd smile. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
BLACK 
FADE IN: 
INT. CONSTANCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Constance wakes with a jolt, sweating. She gets up and goes into her bathroom. 
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
She turns on the light, moves to the sink, opens the medicine cabinet. It's stacked with prescription medicines. Suddenly, she turns to the toilette, vomits. 
FADE TO: 
BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
INT. BARNES & NOBLE COFFEE HOUSE - DAY 
David and Constance sit by a window, the U.T. campus in the b.g. David's distracted, wearing a suit and a long face. She's wearing the closest thing she has to business attire. She has stacks of paper spread in front of her. 
CONSTANCE Okay, let's say we find an innocent on death row. Wouldn't matter. Corrections would let him go. Governor Harding would go on TV, say, 'Thanks to the good people at DeathWatch, the system works.' Yeah, if they executed an innocent, and we had absolute, undeniable, in-your-face proof, we could demand abolition. Just like happened in England. Are you okay? 
DAVID (coming out of it) Sorry. Yeah. 
He makes an effort, plays the "good listener." 
CONSTANCE But it hasn't happened, not since '76. And won't happen. 
David nods. 
CONSTANCE Dead men can't make a case. 
DAVID And 'Almost Martyrs' don't count. 
CONSTANCE Just keep it rational. The death penalty is expensive and ineffective. No one wants to see a murderer as a victim. 
DAVID Um-hum. 
CONSTANCE And stop that. 
DAVID What? 
CONSTANCE Active listening. I hate active listeners. Makes me feel like I'm with a Dale Carnegie grad who cares more about appearing to listen than actually listening. Did you bring the Amnesty fax? 
DAVID I can listen and appear to listen at the same time. Yeah, no. Damn, I left it home. 
CONSTANCE I have a copy. 
She looks through her papers, finds the copy in the stack beneath her coffee cup. She starts to hand it to him. He is looking out the window, caught in a thought. 
CONSTANCE You want to tell me what's up. 
DAVID Nothing. Everything. Something profoundly stupid happened last night. 
CONSTANCE (teasing) I hope you used a condom. 
A beat. His reaction tells her the jest hit home. 
CONSTANCE Jesus Christ, David. Was she one of yours? 
A longer beat. He holds her eyes. 
DAVID It was Berlin. 
She's stunned, then genuinely angry. 
CONSTANCE Oh, that's great, great. I can hear the grapevine now. They suspended her so Gale could dick her with a clear conscience. 
He looks at his coffee, which he hasn't touched. 
CONSTANCE A power differential equals coercion. Great. You are so weak. 
DAVID Constance, you're not my wife. Thank God. 
CONSTANCE I know you can tell yourself it's a position I aspire to, but believe me, I would rather...

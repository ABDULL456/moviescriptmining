She takes them to the coffee table. Among her own things, a dusty Johnny Walker Black Label bottle sits beside a tumbler (an index card with the #1 leans against it). The area has been outlined on the table with white shoe polish. 
GOTH GIRL She let him crash here sometimes. He was like constantly wasted. Drank Black Label religiously. 
Bitsey and Zack exchange a look. The Goth Girl moves into the kitchen. It's cluttered and dirty except in the various areas which at one point had been outlined and indexed -- the cards are all dirty. A sliding glass door leads onto the patio. The backyard hasn't been mowed in years; roughly twenty pots with dead plants lying around. 
By the door, three small taped Xs are on the floor, outlined and indexed (#2). 
GOTH GIRL This is where the tripod was. My boyfriend borrowed the one we usually show folks. They never found a camera, photos, or videos or anything. Gale must have buried them. These serial killer dudes take photos to whack off to later. 
ZACK He's not exactly a serial killer. 
GOTH GIRL Whatever. 
She moves to the sink. On the linoleum, the position of Constance's body has been chalk-lined (#3). In this area are a pair of handcuffs (#4). Not far off is a roll of packing tape (#5). A pair of latex kitchen gloves are crumpled on the sink counter (#6). 
GOTH GIRL She was like totally naked right here. The meter man saw her through the door. Gale handcuffed her, taped her mouth, then taped a bag over her head so she couldn't breathe. My boyfriend says that's probably when he fucked her. Your muscles tense up when you die -- the sex is better. (pointing) He used those housewife gloves so he wouldn't leave prints. They found sticky stuff from the tape on them. 
Zack picks up the gloves. 
GOTH GIRL We ask folks not to touch the exhibit. 
ZACK Right. 
He puts them back. 
GOTH GIRL The totally sick part was where they found the key -- 
BITSEY We know, you can save that. 
ZACK What? Where was it? 
GOTH GIRL It was in her stomach, dude. He made her swallow it before he bagged her. 
A beat. Zack's shocked. 
GOTH GIRL That's pretty much the highlight. 
Got questions? 
INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY 
Bitsey drives. They are on the two-lane highway to Huntsville. Zack smokes out the window. 
BITSEY It was in the case file. 
ZACK Fuck, in her stomach? That's colder than Wisconsin. 
BITSEY (looking in the rearview mirror) Zack, open your vanity. 
ZACK What? 
BITSEY The vanity mirror, pull it down. 
He does so. 
BITSEY See that truck behind us? 
ZACK Yeah. 
BITSEY Isn't that the cowboy from the rest area? 
They look in their respective mirrors. Some distance behind them is the older cowboy in his pickup. 
ZACK Same truck. 
BITSEY Weird coincidence, huh? 
ZACK (turning) Coincidences are always weird, that's why they're coincidences. 
INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY 
Bitsey sits in front of David. He's less animated than the day before, drained. He rubs his wrists. They are speaking in hushed tones. 
A beat. 
DAVID Off-the-record? 
BITSEY Alright, we're off. 
DAVID Constance was murdered with what's called the Securitat Method. You're hand-cuffed, forced to swallow the key, taped at the mouth, a bag's sealed over your head and you're left to suffocate. The Securitat did this to Romanians who wouldn't inform or confess. Sometimes the bag was ripped off at the last second, you got a second chance. If not, you die knowing the 'key' to your freedom was inside you the whole time. A cheap-but-effective metonym. Problem is I mentioned the method in an early article. The prosecution never knew. 
BITSEY You're telling me someone's framing you? 
DAVID It's more than that. 
DAVID There was a tripod. 
BITSEY Right, facing her body. Are we on? 
DAVID (nods agreement) Not a single print was found on it. Someone brought it, wiped it, left it. Why? It's as if they wanted me to know that somewhere there's a record of what really happened that afternoon. As if they wanted me to die knowing the key to my freedom was... out there.

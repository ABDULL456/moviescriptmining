JOF To make one of the balls stand absolutely still in the air. 
MIA But that's impossible. 
JOF Impossible for us -- but not for him. 
MIA You're dreaming again. 
She yawns. The sun, has made her a bit drowsy and she lies down on the grass. JOF does likewise and puts one arm around his wife's shoulders. 
JOF I've composed a song. I made it up during the night when I couldn't sleep. Do you want to hear it? 
MIA Sing it. I'm very curious. 
JOF I have to sit up first. 
He sits with his legs crossed, makes a dramatic gesture with his arms and sings in a loud voice. 
JOF (sings) On a lily branch a dove is perched Against the summer sky, She sings a wondrous song of Christ And there's great joy on high. 
He interrupts his singing in order to be complimented by his wife. 
JOF Mia! Are you asleep? 
MIA It's a lovely song. 
JOF I haven't finished yet. 
MIA I heard it, but I think I'll sleep a little longer. You can sing the rest to me afterwards. 
JOF All you do is sleep. 
JOF is a bit offended and glances over at his son, MIKAEL, but he is also sleeping soundly in the high grass. JONAS SKAT comes out from the wagon. He yawns; he is very tired and in a bad humor. In his hands he holds a crudely made death mask. 
SKAT Is this supposed to be a mask for an actor? If the priests didn't pay us so well, I'd say no thank you. 
JOF Are you going to play Death? 
SKAT Just think, scaring decent folk out of their wits with this kind of nonsense. 
JOF When are we supposed to do this play? 
SKAT At the saints' feast in Elsinore. We're going to perform right on the church steps, believe it or not.

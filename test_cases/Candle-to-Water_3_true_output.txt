URI Misses Pentane please hear me. (more) 
70 | P a g e (cont'd) Why did I come here today? Well, the truth is I believe you should have the facts. The facts are that. . .we believe your husband was wrongfully arrested and . . . 
She looks at him. No shit! 
A family walking in the hall outside the door draw her attention. A mother and her two sons. They smile at her. 
She tries to smile, closes the door slightly. 
Uri is almost hyperventilating by now. 
ELLE You need to get the hell away from me. Sorry, but. . . 
URI Misses Pentane the fact is that your husband was subjected to rendition. Not as you may have heard of it but in a form. . . 
She has to lean against the wall. 
URI Whilst in this instance your husband wasn't transported abroad because of logistics. 
ELLE (a whisper) Logistics? 
URI He was subjected here, in the United Kingdom to a process designed to get him to confess. 
4.107 INT. BOARD ROOM, FACILITY - DAY 
Uri feels his burnt tongue. Boothy, Silk and Parker observe. 
BOOTHY What we need to establish, Uri, is whether, having found out (more) 
71 | P a g e (cont'd) that you had made a mistake, you killed Nicholas Pentane deliberately, or whether his death was merely a product of of the processes to which he was being subjected. 
URI He was no longer any use. By that stage his body was, his mind. . .He would never have been able to lead an ordinary life: work, have relationships. 
BOOTHY So you did the judicious thing and disposed of the suspect accordingly? 
4.108 INT. ELLE'S APARTMENT ­ DAY, SAME TIME 
Elle stands by the door. She buckles. He wants to help her. 
URI Your husband was tortured, Misses Pentane. 
His voice has an unnatural edge to it. It sounds weird. 
She starts to laugh hysterically. It's all a joke. Of course. 
URI These are measures taken occasionally and in conditions of the utmost secrecy against certain suspects accused of terrorism ­ I'm sure you're aware. 
She stops laughing. 
She stares at him, tries to form words. 
Her knees give out. He goes to her, helps her. 
ELLE DON'T TOUCH ME! 
She pushes him away in panic. He recoils. 
72 | P a g e ELLE Get out. Now. 
Another text message bleeps ludicrously from her phone. 
URI This isn't exactly what I came here to tell you, Misses . . . Not entirely. . . 
She leans again the wall. He shuts the door softly. 
He seems to reach a critical mass. Emotion leaves him. 
URI What I came here to tell you today that it was me. I oversaw the torture and tortured your husband. It was under my ministrations . . . 
She is incredulous of the use of the word. 
URI It was me, you see. I killed him. An accident. Only so much.

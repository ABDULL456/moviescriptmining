Talley clips the gun to his belt under his sweatshirt.  He's ready to rock.  The camera finds the photograph of Talley during his days as a SWAT tactical officer -- 
He was one bad motherfucker. 
INT. THE MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT 
Talley heads for the front door -- 
TALLEY I'm going back to York.  Have Larry meet me at the front gate. 
Talley exits without a backward glance -- 
EXT. YORK ESTATES FRONT GATE -- NIGHT 
The helicopters orbit in the distance; the empty lot with the news vans is in the background. 
Talley turns into the development, then stops at the side of the street where Larry Anders is waiting -- 
INT. TALLEY'S CAR -- NIGHT 
Anders slides into the passenger seat.  He sees a different Talley now, focused and grim -- 
ANDERS What's up, Chief? 
Talley stares at Anders, trying to decide:  Can I trust him? Will he rat me out to the Watchman and cost the lives of my wife and child? 
ANDERS (CONT'D) Did I do something wrong? 
Talley gives him a slip of paper -- 
TALLEY I want you to run this license plate and phone number.  Then I want you to find out everything you can about Walter Smith. ANDERS The guy in the house? 
TALLEY Go back to the office.  Run his name through the FBI and the NLETS database. I think he's involved with illegal activity or he associates with people who are. 
Anders glances at the slip again, then tucks it away -- 
ANDERS Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief. 
TALLEY Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry? 
ANDERS I guess so. 
TALLEY Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut. 
ANDERS I will, Chief.  Absolutely. 
TALLEY Get to work. 
Anders climbs out and Talley rockets away -- 
EXT. COMMAND STREET -- NIGHT 
Talley pulls up behind the Sheriffs' command van.  Martin, surprised to see Talley, steps from the van -- 
TALLEY I'm re-assuming command of the scene. 
Martin is surprised and angry -- 
MARTIN Excuse me?  You requested our help.  You turned over command -- 
TALLEY And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house. 
Talley heads for the cul-de-sac -- 
INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
Jennifer is on her bed in the darkness, groggy with fear and fatigue.  She hears someone outside in the hall -- 
JENNIFER Thomas? 
The door knob rattles.  Jennifer slides out of bed and goes to the door -- 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Thomas, is that you? 
The door suddenly opens, and Mars is framed in the dim light. Jennifer jumps back, terrified -- 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) What do you want? 
MARS We can't make the microwave work. 
That seems so outlandish that Jennifer is confused -- 
JENNIFER What? 
MARS We're hungry.  You're going to cook. 
Mars grabs her hair, and pushes her out the door -- 
INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT 
Mars shoves Jennifer into the kitchen.  Two frozen pizzas are waiting on the counter -- 
MARS Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.

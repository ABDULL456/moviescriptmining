{"train": "Aliens - by James Cameron \n\"ALIENS\" \nby \nJames Cameron \nFIRST DRAFT May 28, 1985 \nALIENS \nFADE IN \nSOMETIME IN THE FUTURE - SPACE                            1 \nSilent and endless.  The stars shine like the love of God...cold and remote.  Against them drifts a tiny chip of technology. \nCLOSER SHOT  It is the NARCISSUS, lifeboat of the ill-fated star-freighter Nostromo.  Without interior or running lights it seems devoid of life.  The PING of a RANGING RADAR grows louder, closer.  A shadow engulfs the Narcissus.  Searchlights flash on, playing over the tiny ship, as a MASSIVE DARK HULL descends toward it. \nINT. NARCISSUS                                            2 \nDark and dormant as a crypt.  The searchlights stream in the dusty windows.  Outside, massive metal forms can BE SEEN descending around the shuttle.  Like the tolling of a bell, a BASSO PROFUNDO CLANG reverberates through the hull. \nCLOSE ON THE AIRLOCK DOOR  Light glares as a cutting torch bursts through the metal.  Sparks shower into the room. \nA second torch cuts through.  They move with machine precision, cutting a rectangular path, converging.  The torches meet.  Cut off.  The door falls inward REVEALING a bizarre multi-armed figure.  A ROBOT WELDER. \nFIGURES ENTER, backlit and ominous.  THREE MEN in bio-isolation suits, carrying lights and equipment.  They approach a sarcophaguslike HYPERSLEEP CAPSULE, f.g. \nLEADER (filtered) Internal pressure positive.  Assume nominal hull integrity.  Hypersleep capsules, style circa late twenties... \nHis gloved hand wipes at on opaque layer of dust on the canopy. \nANGLE INSIDE CAPSULE  as light stabs in where the dust is wiped away, illuminating a WOMAN, her face in peaceful repose. \nWARRANT OFFICER RIPLEY, sole survivor of the Nostromo. Nestled next to her is JONES, the ship's wayward cat. \nLEADER (voice over; filtered) Lights are green.  She's alive. Well, there goes out salvage, guys. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - GATEWAY STATION    3 \nShe's lying in a bed, looking wan, as a female MED-TECH raises the backrest.  She is surrounded by arcane white MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.  The Med-Tech exudes practiced cheeriness. \nMED-TECH Why don't I open the viewport? Watch your eyes. \nHarsh light floods in as a motorized shield slides into the ceiling, REVEALING a breathtaking vista.  Beyond the sprawling complex of modular habitats, collectively called GATEWAY STATION, is the curve of EARTH as seen from high orbit.  Blue and serene. \nMED-TECH And how are we today? \nRIPLEY (weakly) Terrible. \nMED-TECH Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least. \nRIPLEY How long have I been on Gateway station? \nMED-TECH Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor? \nRipley shrugs, not caring.  The door opens and a MAN enters, although Ripley sees only what he is carrying. A familiar large, orange TOMCAT. \nRIPLEY Jones! \nShe grabs the cat like a life preserver. \nRIPLEY (cooing baby-cat talk) Come here Jonesy you ugly old moose...you ugly thing. \nJones patiently endures Ripley's embarrassing display, seeming none the worse for wear.  The visitor sits beside the bed and Ripley finally notices him.  He is thirtyish and handsome, in a suit that looks executive or legal, the tie loosened with studied casualness.  A smile referred to as \"winning.\" \nMAN Nice room.  I'm Burke.  Carter Burke. I work for the company, but other than that I'm an okay guy.  Glad to see you're feeling better.  I'm told the weakness and disorientation should pass soon.  Side effects of the unusually long hypersleep, or something like that. \nRIPLEY How long was I out there?  They won't tell me anything. \nBURKE (soothing) Well, maybe you shouldn't worry about that just yet. \nRipley grabs his arm, surprising him. \nRIPLEY How long? \nLYDECKER You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago? \nSIMPSON Yeah.  What? \nLYDECKER There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored. \nSIMPSON Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.' \nLYDECKER So what do I tell this guy? \nSIMPSON Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his. \nEXT. ACHERON - THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - A SIX-WHEELED     14 TRACTOR - DAY \nIt roars across corrugated rock, blasting through soggy drifts of volcanic ash. \nINT. TRACTOR                                             15 \nAt the controls, intent on a PINGING scope, is RUSS JORDEN, independent prospector.  Beside him is his wife/partner ANNE and in the back their two kids are playing among the heavy sampling equipment. \nJORDEN (gloating cackle) Look at this fat, juicy magnetic profile.  And it's mine, mine, mine. \nANNE Half mine, dear. \nNEWT, their six-year-old daughter, yells from the back... \nNEWT And half mine! \nJORDEN I got too many partners. \nNEWT Daddy, when are we going back to town? \nJORDEN When we get rich, Newt. \nNEWT You always say that.  I wanna go back.  I wanna play 'Monster Maze.' \nHer older brother TIM sticks his jeering face close to hers. \nTIM You cheat too much. \nNEWT Do not.  I'm just the best. \nTIM Do too!  You go in places we can't fit. \nNEWT So!  That's why I'm the best. \nANNE Knock it off!  I catch either of you playing in the air ducts again I'll tan your hides. \nNEWT Mom.  All the kids play it... \nJORDEN (reverently) Holy shiiit! \nANGLE THROUGH FRONT CANOPY  ON a bizarre shape looming ahead.  An enormous bonelike mass projecting upward from the bed of ash.  The tractor slows. \nCanted on its side and buckles against a rock outcropping by the lava flow, it is still recognizable as an EXTRATERRESTRIAL SHIP.  Bio-mechanoid.  Nonhuman design. \nJORDEN Folks, we have scored big this time. \nEXT. TRACTOR                                             16 \nJorden and Anne step down, wearing ENVIRONMENT SUITS. Carrying LIGHTS, PACKS, CAMERAS, TEST GEAR.  Their breath clouds in the chill air. \nANNE You kids stay inside.  I mean it!  We'll be right back. \nThey trudge toward the alien derelict. \nANNE Shouldn't we call in? \nJORDEN Let's wait till we know what to call it in as. \nANNE (nervous) How about 'big weird thing'? \nThey pause at a twisted gash in the hull.  Blackness inside. \nINT./EXT. TRACTOR                                        17 \nNewt has her face pressed to the glass, steaming it. Watching her parents enter the strange ship.  Tim GRABS HER from behind.  She SHRIEKS. \nTIM Cheater! \nRIPLEY If I go. \nBURKE If you go. (pause) It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse... \nRIPLEY (frosty) Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month. \nBurke leans close, a let's-cut-the-crap intimacy. \nBURKE Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over... \nRIPLEY (shouting) No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you. \nBurke nods to Gorman who rises with him.  He slips a TRANSLUCENT CARD onto the table, heads for the door. \nBURKE Think about it. \nEXT. ACHERON LANDSCAPE - NIGHT                           23 \nAs the wind HOWLS through tormented rock, BUILDING IN PITCH until we: \nCUT TO: \nINT. APARTMENT                                           24 \nRipley lunges INTO FRAME with an animal outcry.  She clutches her chest, breathing hard.  Bathed in sweat she lights a cigarette with trembling hands.  Do we hear a faint, desolate wind? \nTIGHT ON PHONE CONSOLE  as Ripley's hand inserts Burke's card into a slot.  \"STAND BY\" prints out on the screen and is replaced by Burke's face, bleary with sleep. \nBURKE (on video phone) Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi... \nRIPLEY Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever. \nBURKE That's the plan.  My word on it. \nCLOSEUP - RIPLEY  taking a deep slow breath.  It's time to look the demon in the eye. \nRIPLEY All right.  I'm in. \nShe punches off before Burke replies, before she can change her mind.  She turns to Jones sitting on the bed and her tone becomes admonishing... \nRIPLEY And you my dear, are staying right here. \nJones blinks, cynical cat eyes...\"count me right out.\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DEEP SPACE - THREE WEEKS LATER                      25 \nAn empty starfield.  Metal spires slice ACROSS FRAME. \nA mountain of steel following.  A massive military transport ship, the SULACO.  Ugly, battered... functional. \nINT. CORRIDOR TO CARGO LOCK                              26 \nAn empty corridor, seemingly miles long.  No movement. The THRUMMING of hyperdrive engines. \nINT. CARGO LOCK                                          27 \nAn enormous chamber, cavernous and dark.  Squatting in the shadows are two orbit-to-surface shuttles. DROP-SHIPS.  Heavy machinery all around them... cranes, loading equipment. \nINT. BRIDGE                                              28 \nDark electronic womb.  CAMERA DOLLIES SLOWLY among murmuring instrumentation.  A sudden high-pitched TRILLING accompanies a sequence of lights.  An alarm. \nINT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT                                    29 \nBlackness, until a bank of indicators lights up. Hydraulics lift a grid of equipment from a row of horizontal HYPERSLEEP CYLINDERS.  It reaches the ceiling.  Locks. \nCLOSE ON RIPLEY'S CAPSULE  as trickles of water run down the frosted canopy. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT                                    30 \nLit up, white and sterile. \nThe canopies of the row of capsules are raised.  Ripley sits up.  Rubs her arms briskly.  Next to her Gorman and Burke are stirring and beyond them the troopers, wearing shorts and dog tags.  They are: \nMASTER SERGEANT APONE                    UNIT LEADER \nHUDSON Excuse me. \nANGLE ON APONE  standing with Hicks, as Ripley approaches him \nRIPLEY I feel like a fifth wheel here.  Is there anything I can do? \nAPONE I don't know.  Is there anything you can do? \nRIPLEY (pointing) I can drive that loader.  I've got a Class Two rating.  My latest career move. \nApone turns.  A SECOND POWER LOADER sits unused in an equipment bay. \nTWO SHOT APONE AND HICKS  skeptical.  Considering. \nTIGHT ON POWER SWITCH  as Ripley's finger punches it on. A RISING WHINE of power. \nTIGHT ON THE HYDRAULICS  as the massive machine stirs to life. \nFULL, as the loader starts.  Ripley is strapped into the safety cage, her arms and legs inserted in the servo-sensor assemblies.  She takes a step.  BOOM! Two tons of hardened steel takes a step. \nRipley spins the wrist servos.  The huge claws swing, open...slide smoothly into lifting brackets on a cargo module, nearby.  She raises it deftly. \nRIPLEY Where you want it? \nHicks looks at Apone, cocks an eyebrow appreciatively. \nINT. READY ROOM - ARMORY                                 39 \nThe troopers are suiting up for the drop.  Strapping on their bulky COMBAT-ARMOR...interlocking plates like football padding.  They tape their wrists.  Draw on segmented boots.  The sole cleats CLACK like hooves on the deck plates.  Lockers SLAM. \nWEB BELTS.  PACKS.  HARNESSES.  HELMETS.  COM-SETS. Their fingers move methodically over the fastenings. It has its own rhythm...CLICK.  CLICK.  CLICK. \nAPONE Let's move it, girls!  On the ready line.  Let's go, let's go. \nINT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     40 \nRipley, wearing a flight jacket and headset, files into the ship with the hulking troopers.  Inside they pass directly into the APC we saw loaded earlier and take seats facing each other across a narrow aisle.  They will drop already strapped into their ground vehicle for rapid deployment.  A KLAXON SOUNDS, signalling depressurization of the cargo lock. \nHudson prowls the aisle, his movements predatory and exaggerated.  Ripley watches him working his way toward her. \nHUDSON I am ready, man.  Ready to get it on.  Check-it-out.  I am the ultimate badass...state of the badass art.  You do not want to fuck with me.  Hey, Ripley, don't worry.  Me and my squad of ultimate badasses will protect you. Check-it-out... \nHe slaps the SERVO-CANNON controls in the GUN BAY above them. \nHUDSON Independently targetting particle-beam phalanx.  VWAP! Fry half a city with this puppy. We got tactical smart-missles, phased-plasma pulse-rifles, RPG's.  We got sonic eeelectronic ballbreakers, we got nukes, we got knives...sharp sticks -- \nHicks grabs Hudson by his battle harness and pulls him into a seat.  His voice is low, but it carries. \nHICKS Save it. \nHUDSON Sure, Hicks. \nRipley nods her thanks to Hicks.  MOTORS WHINE and the craft lurches.  Burke, next to Ripley, grins eagerly like this is a sport fishing trip. \nBURKE Here we go. \nShe looks like she's in a gas chamber waiting for the pellet to drop. \nEXT. SULACO                                              41 \nThe drop-ship lowers from the cargo-lock on a massive launch rig.  The night side of Acheron yawns below... enigmatic. \nINT. COCKPIT                                             42 \nFerro and Spunkmeyer run rapidly through the switches. \nFERRO Initiate release sequencer on my mark.  Three.  Two.  One.  Mark! \nEXT. SULACO - DROP-SHIP                                  43 \nHydraulic WHINE.  Clamps SLAM BACK.  The ship drops. \nINT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     44 \nApone, stalking the aisle, snatches for a handhold. Bishop, Burke and Gorman groan at the sudden gees. Ripley closes her eyes...the point of no return. \nEXT. DROP-SHIP                                           45 \nIt screams down through the stratosphere, plunging into dark turbulence. \nVASQUEZ (turning away) Figures. \nGORMAN (to Ferro via mike) Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station. \nAPONE Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp! \nEXT. COLONY COMPLEX                                      53 \nLanding beacons sweep harsh light across the wet Tarmac. The ship roars down, extending the loading ramp.  Slams down on hydraulic LANDING LEGS.  The APC hits the ground a moment later, pulling away from the ship as it leaps up in a cloud of spray and peels off, circling. \nThe APC pulls to the edge of the complex.  The CREW DOOR opens.  Troopers hit the ground running.  Spread out. They drop behind immediate cover.  Apone scans with him image intensifier visor lowered. \nAPONE'S P.O.V.  through the starlight-scope visor. Bright as a sunny day, though contrasty and lurid, we SEE the colony buildings.  Trash blows in the street. No other movement. \nGORMAN (voice over; filtered) First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear. \nAPONE Vasquez, take point.  Let's move. \nSprinting in a skirmish line, Apone's team advances on the colony main entry-lock.  Parked tightly across the doors are two heavy-duty tractors.  Vasquez reaches one of the tractors, looks inside.  The controls are ripped out, as if by a crowbar or axe.  She moves on. \nEXT. COLONY BUILDING                                     54 \nVasquez reaches the main doors, Drake flanking on the right.  Apone tries the door controls.  Nothing. \nAPONE Sealed.  Hudson, run a bypass. \nHudson, all business now, moves up and studies the door control panel.  He pries off the facing and starts clipping on the bypass wires. \nAPONE First squad, assemble on me at the main lock. \nThe wind roars around the bleak structures.  A neon sign creaks overhead.  Hudson makes a connection.  The door shrieks in its tracks and rumbles aside.  It jams partway open.  Apone motions Vasquez inside.  She eases over the wrecked tractor, through the doors. The others follow. \nGORMAN (voice over; filtered) Second team, move up. Flanking positions. \nINT. COLONY - MAIN CONCOURSE                             55 \nDOLLYING SLOWLY FORWARD, following Vasquez and Apone as they move into the broad corridor.  A few emergency lights are still on.  Wind moans along the concourse. Pools of water cover the floor.  Farther down, rain drips through blast holes in the ceiling.  Evidence of a fire fight with pulse-rifles. \nON VASQUEZ  moving forward.  Taut.  Alert.  Her smart-gun cannon swinging slowly in an arc.  She studies the video aiming monitor, looking down rather than ahead. Their footsteps echo. \nINT. APC                                                 56 \nRipley watches as the bobbing images reveal the empty colony building. \nGORMAN Quarter and search by twos.  Second team move inside.  Hicks, take the upper level.  Use your motion trackers. \nINT. MAIN CONCOURSE - SECOND LEVEL                       57 \nHicks leads his squad up the stairwell to second level. They emerge cautiously.  An empty corridor recedes into the dim distance.  Hicks unslings a rugged piece of equipment.  Aims it down the hall.  He adjusts the \"gain.\"  It remains silent. \nHICKS Nothing.  No movement. \nThey pass rooms and offices.  Through doors they see increasing signs of struggle.  Furniture overturned. Papers scattered...floating sodden in the puddles. \nINT. APC                                                 58 \nRipley et al watching. \nBURKE Looks like my room in college. \nNobody laughs. \nINT. SECOND LEVEL                                        59 \nHicks' group passes several burnt-out rooms.  There are no bodies.  In several offices the exterior windows are blown out, admitting wind and rain.  Hicks picks up a half-eaten donut beside a coffee cup overflowing with rainwater. \nINT. LOWER LEVEL - QUARTERS                              60 \nApone's men are searching systematically in pairs.  They pass through the colonists' modest apartments, little more than cubicles.  Hudson, on tracker, flanks Vasquez as they move forward.  Hudson touches a splash of color on the wall.  Dried blood.  His tracker BEEPS. \nVasquez whirls, cannon aimed.  The BEEPING grows more frequent as Hudson advances toward a half open door.  The door is splintered partway out of its frame.  Holes caused by pulse-rifle rounds pepper the walls.  Vasquez eases up to the door.  Kicks it in.  Tenses to fire. \nInside, dangling from a piece of flex conduit, a junction-box swings like a pendulum in the wind from a broken window.  It clanks against the rails of a child's bunkbed as it swings. \nINT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     61 \nRipley watches Hicks' monitor. \nRIPLEY Wait!  Tell him to... (plugs in headset jack) ...Hicks.  Back up.  Pan left. There! \nFRONT Sir, you should check this out... \nHe leads the way into the corridor. \nINT. CORRIDOR                                            69 \nThis wing is completely without power.  The troopers switch on their pack lights and the beams illuminate a scene of devastation worse than they have seen.  Her expression reveals that Ripley is about to turn and flee. \nFROST Right ahead here... \nThey approach a barricade blocking the corridor, a hastily welded wall of pipes, steel-plate, outer-door panels.  Acid holes have slashed through the floor and walls in several places.  The metal is scratched and twisted by hideously powerful forces, peeled back like a soup can on one side.  They squeeze through the opening. \nINT. MEDICAL WING                                        70 \nThey pack-lights play over the devastation of the colonists' last ditch battle.  The equipment of the med labs has been uprooted to add to the barrier.  The walls are perforated by pulse-rifle fire and acid.  Scorched by untended fires to bare metal.  A few instruments glow with emergency power. \nWIERZBOWSKI Last stand. \nGORMAN No bodies? \nFROST No, Sir.  Looks like it was a helluva fight. \nTIGHT ON RIPLEY  transfixed by something. \nRIPLEY (low) Over there. \nThe others turn and approach, seeing what she sees.  She has entered a second room, part of the med lab area.  In a storage alcove at near eye level stand seven transparent cylinders.  STASIS TUBES.  They glow faintly with an eerie violet light given off by the field which preserves the specimens inside. \nThey look like jars containing SEVERED ARTHRITIC HANDS, the palsied fingers curled in a death-rictus. Structurally they are more like spiders with sickening translucent skin, a flacid scrotal body, gill-like organs underneath drifting in the suspension fluid. Something you definitely do not want on your face, for example. \nBURKE Are these the same...? \nRipley nods, unable to speak.  Burke leans closer in fascination.  His face almost touching one cylinder, is lit by its glow. \nRIPLEY Watch it, Burke... \nThe creature inside lunges suddenly, slamming against the glass.  Burke jumps back.  From the palm of the thing's handlike body emerges a pearl-escent TUBULE. like a tapered piece of intestine, which slithers tonguelike over the inside of the glass.  Then it retracts into a sheath between the \"gills.\" \nHICKS (to Burke) It likes you. \nOnly two of the creatures seem to pulse with life. Burke taps the other stasis cylinders but the hand-things remain inertly clenched. \nBURKE These are dead.  There's just the two alive. \nOn top of each cylinder is a file folder.  Ripley takes a folder from above one of the live specimens.  Inside is a medical chart printout with handwritten entries. \nRIPLEY (reading) Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure. (looking up) They killed him getting it off. \nHICKS Poor bastard. \nThey are startled by a LOUD BEEP.  They turn.  Hicks is intent on his motion tracker, aimed back toward the shattered barricade.  BEEP.  BEEP. \nHICKS Behind us. \nHe gestures at the corridor they just passed through. \nRIPLEY One of us? \nGORMAN (into headset) Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block? \nAPONE (voice over; filtered) Negative.  We're all in Operations. \nVasquez swings the smart-gun to ready position on its support arm, locking it with an authoritative CLICK.  She and Hicks head toward the source of the signal, the others following. \nINT. CORRIDOR                                            71 \nHicks' tracker is reading out more rapidly.  They turn into the kitchens, a stainless steel labyrinth. \nRipley hangs back.  Then realizes there is nothing behind her but darkness.  She catches up to the group. \nINT. KITCHENS                                            72 \nThe troopers enter, their lights bouncing around the stainless steel surfaces. \nHICKS It's moving. \nVasquez is scanning, gaze intense.  The other troops grip their weapons tightly. \nVASQUEZ Which way? \nRIPLEY Uh oh.  I made a clean spot here.  Now I've done it.  Guess I'll just have to do the whole thing. \nShe pours water from a squeeze bottle onto a small cloth and gently washes the little girl's face. Newt's eyes seem to focus on her for the first time. \nRIPLEY Hard to believe...there's a little girl under all this. And a pretty one at that. \nNewt gazes at her.  Ripley smiles. \nINT. OPERATIONS                                          74 \nThe ground teams are gathered around a terminal in the computer center.  Hudson has the CPU main computer on-line and reading out. \nTIGHT ON MONITOR SCREEN  as an abstract of the main colony ground plan drifts across the screen. Searching. \nHudson bashes at the keyboard, his fingers dancing expertly. \nBURKE (to Gorman) What's he scanning for? \nGORMAN PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted. \nHUDSON If they're within twenty klicks we'll read it out here, but so far...zip. \nINT. OFFICE                                              75 \nRipley is washing Newt's tiny hands with a cloth, pink skin emerging from black grime. \nRIPLEY I don't know how you managed to stay alive but you're one brave kid, Rebecca. \nNewt's voice is almost inaudible. \nNEWT N-newt. \nRipley leans closer.  Feels like she's breathing on coals.  The sound was incomprehensible. \nRIPLEY What did you say? \nNEWT Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother. \nRipley grins inanely, not wanting to move or speak... or break the spell. \nRIPLEY Well, Newt it is then.  My name's Ripley...and people call me Ripley. \nRipley picks up her tiny limp hand, shaking it formally. \nRIPLEY Pleased to meet you.  And who is this?  Does she have a name? \nNewt glances at the disembodied doll, still clutched in one filthy hand. \nNEWT Casey.  She's my only friend. \nRIPLEY What about me? \nNewt's reply is flat, neutral. \nNEWT I don't want you for a friend. \nRIPLEY Why not? \nNEWT Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone. \nRipley gazes at her, chilled both by the ominous statement and by the situation which could have produced this outlook in a child. \nRIPLEY Oh, Newt.  You mom and dad went away like that, didn't they? \nNewt nods, staring at her knees. \nRIPLEY (soothingly) They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would. \nNEWT (with cold certainty) They're dead. \nRIPLEY Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.

Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built... \nRIPLEY That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system. \nBURKE (realizing) She's right. \nGORMAN So. \nRIPLEY So...then the fusion containment shuts down. \nGORMAN (impatient) So?

Harsh language? \nGORMAN (voice over; static) Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung. \nAPONE Let's go.  Pull 'em out. \nHe walks among the troopers, collecting the magazines from each one's weapon. \nVasquez turns hers over reluctantly. \nThe three who are carrying them get out small incinerator units.  When Apone moves on, Vasquez slips a spare magazine from concealment and inserts it in her weapon.  Drake does the same.  Hicks hangs back in the shadows.  He opens a cylindrical sheath attached to his battle-harness.  Slides out an old style PUMP TWELVE-GAUGE with a sawed-off butt stock.  Chambers a round. \nHICKS (low, to Hudson) I always keep this handy. For close encounter. \nAPONE (o.s.) Let's move.  Hicks, back us up. \nINT.

I think he's paralyzed. \nVASQUEZ He's fucking dead! \nShe grabs Gorman by the collar, hauling him up roughly, ready to pulp him with her other fist. \nVASQUEZ (to Gorman) Wake up pendejo!  I'm gonna kill you, you useless fuck! \nHicks pushes her back.  Right in her face. \nHICKS Hold it.  Hold it.  Back off, right now. \nVasquez releases Gorman.  His head smacks the deck. Ripley opens Gorman's tunic, revealing a bloodless purple puncture wound. \nRIPLEY Looks like it stung him. \nHUDSON Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man. \nThey turn to see Hudson at the MTOB monitors, pointing at the bio-function screens. \nHUDSON They must be like Gorman.  Their signs are real low but they ain't dead! \nHudson is pale, panicky, and his voice echoes around the tiny metallic space and comes back to all of them as the near hysteria they all feel, fluttering just at the edges of their minds. \nRIPLEY You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others. \nHUDSON (sagging) Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening. \nRipley and Vasquez lock eyes.

Nerve gas the whole nest? \nHUDSON Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay? \nRIPLEY (to Vasquez) No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure. \nBURKE Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action. \nRIPLEY Why not? \nBurke senses the challenge in her tone and backpedals flawlessly into conciliatory mode. \nBURKE Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it -- \nRIPLEY They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second? \nBURKE This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them -- \nRIPLEY Bullshit! \nVASQUEZ Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us. \nHUDSON Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal! \nRipley faces Burke squarely and she's not pleased. \nNEWT I guess we're not leaving, right? \nRIPLEY I'm sorry, Newt. \nNEWT You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault. \nHUDSON (kicking rocks) Just tell me what the fuck we're supposed to do now.  What're we gonna do now? \nBURKE (annoyed) May be could build a fire and sing songs. \nNEWT We should get back, 'cause it'll be dark soon.  They come mostly at night.

OPERATIONS                                         116 \nThe weary and demoralized group is gathered to take stock of their grim options.  Vasquez and Hudson are just setting down a scorched and dented packing case, one of several culled from the APC wreckage. \nHicks indicates their remaining inventory of weapons, lying on a table. \nHICKS This is all we could salvage.  We've got four pulse-rifles with about fifty rounds each.  Not so good. About fifteen M-40 grenades and two flame throwers less than half full...one damaged.  And We've got four of these robot-sentry units with scanners and display intact. \nHe opens one of the scorched cases, revealing a high-tech servo-actuated machine gun with optical sensing equipment, packed in foam. \nRIPLEY How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue? \nHICKS About seventeen days. \nHUDSON Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before... \nRIPLEY She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training. \nRipley indicates Newt, who salutes Hudson smartly. \nRIPLEY So you better just start dealing with it.  Just deal with it, Hudson...because we need you and I'm tired of your bullshit.  Now get on a terminal and call up some kind of floor plan file. Construction blueprints, maintenance schematics, anything that shows the layout of this place.  I want to see air ducts, electrical access tunnels, subbasements.  Every possible way into this wing. \nHudson gathers himself, thankful for the direction. Hicks nods approval of her handling of it. \nHUDSON Aye-firmative.  I'm on it. \nBISHOP I'll be in medical.  I'd like to continue my analysis. \nRIPLEY Fine.  You do that. \nINT. OPERATIONS                                         117 \nBurke, Ripley, Hudson and Hicks are bent over a large HORIZONTAL VIDEOSCREEN, like an illuminated chart table. Newt hops from one foot to the other to see. \nRIPLEY This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth. \nHUDSON Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here. \nHe traces a finger along the abstract ground plan. \nRIPLEY All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door. \nHICKS We gotta figure on them getting into the complex. \nRIPLEY That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections... (pointing) ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here. \nHicks contemplates her game plan and raises his hand, satisfied. \nHICKS Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose. \nHUDSON Aye-firmative. \nNEWT (imitating Hudson) Aye-firmative! \nINT. SERVICE TUNNEL - SUBLEVEL                          118 \nA long straight service tunnel, lined with conduit, seems to go on forever.  Vasquez and Hudson have finished setting up two of the robot sentry guns on tripods in the tunnel. \nVASQUEZ (shouting) Testing! \nShe hurls a wastebasket down the tunnel, into the automatic field of fire.  The sentry guns swivel smoothly, the wastebasket bounces once...and is riddled by two quick bursts of EXPLODING 10MM ROUNDS into dime-sized shrapnel.  They retreat behind a heavy steel FIRE DOOR which they roll closed on its track.  Vasquez, using a PORTABLE WELDING TORCH, begins sealing the door to its frame, as Hudson paces nervously. \nNEWT Where is she? \nRIPLEY (quietly) Gone. \nNEWT You mean dead. \nIt's more statement than question.  Ripley nods slowly. \nShe turns, reaching for a PORTABLE SPACE HEATER sitting nearby, and slides it closer to the bed.  She switches it on.  It HUMS and emits a cozy orange glow. \nNEWT Ripley, I was just thinking... Maybe I could do you a favor and fill in for her.  Just for a while.  You can try it and if you don't like it, it's okay. I'll understand.  No big deal. Whattya think? \nRipley gazes at her a long time before answering... a conflict between the urge to crush the child to her in a forever hug and the knowledge that neither of them may see another dawn. \nRIPLEY I think it's not the worst idea I've heard all day.  Let's talk about it later. \nShe switches off the light and starts to rise.  Newt grabs her arm.  A plaintive voice in the dark. \nNEWT Don't go!  Please. \nRIPLEY I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there. \nNewt looks at the VIDEO SECURITY CAMERA above the door. Ripley unsnaps the TRACKER BRACELET given to her by Hicks and puts it on Newt's tiny wrist, cinching it down. \nRIPLEY Here.  Take is for luck.  Now go to sleep...and don't dream. \nRipley walks away and Newt rolls on her side, hugging Casey and gazing at the hypnotically pulsing function light on the bracelet.  The space heater hums comfortingly. \nINT.

The only sign of life. \nRIPLEY (voice over) How is he? \nRipley stands over the Lieutenant, who is lying motionless on an examining table.  Bishop looks up from his instruments nearby, the light of a single gooseneck lamp giving his features a macabre cast. \nBISHOP I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon. \nRIPLEY Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those... \nRipley points at the stasis cylinders containing the face-hugger specimens. \nRIPLEY Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least. \nBISHOP Yes.  That follows. \nRIPLEY But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from. \nBISHOP That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs. \nRIPLEY You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs? \nBISHOP Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society. \nRIPLEY Could it be intelligent? \nBISHOP Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course. \nRipley ponders the ramifications of Bishop's analysis. \nRIPLEY (rising) I want those specimens destroyed as soon as you're done with them. You understand? \nBishop glances at the creatures, pulsing malevolently in their cylinders. \nBISHOP Mr. Burke have instructions that they were to be kept alive in stasis for return to the company labs.  He was very specific. \nRipley feels the fabric of her self-restraint tearing. She slaps the intercom switch. \nRIPLEY Burke! \nINT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      124 \nIn a small observation chamber separated from the med lab by a glass partition, Ripley and Burke have squared off. \nBURKE Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life. \nRIPLEY You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code. \nBURKE You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it. \nHUDSON I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this? \nRIPLEY And it's too late to shut it down? \nBISHOP I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point. \nHUDSON Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man! \nVASQUEZ Hudson, give us a break. \nThey watch as another gas jet lights up the fog-shrouded landscape. \nRIPLEY (to Hicks) We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow. \nHUDSON How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted. \nRIPLEY (pacing) I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something. \nHUDSON Think of what?  We're fucked. \nRIPLEY What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that? \nBISHOP I checked.  The hard wiring between here and there was severed in the fighting. \nRipley is wound up like a dynamo, her mind spinning out options, grim solutions. \nRIPLEY Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually. \nHUDSON Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way. \nBISHOP (quietly) I'll go. \nRIPLEY What? \nBISHOP I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid. \nRIPLEY All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need? \nVASQUEZ Listen.  It's stopped. \nThey listen.  Nothing.  An instant later comes the HIGH-PITCHED TRILLING of a motion-sensor alarm.  Hicks looks at the tactical board. \nHICKS Well, they're into the complex. \nINT. MED LAB                                            130 \nOne of the acid holes from the colonists' siege has yielded access to subfloor conduits.  Bishop lying in the opening, reaches up to graph the portable terminal as Ripley hands it down to him.  He pushes it into the constricted shaft ahead of him.  She then hands him a small satchel containing tools and assorted patch cables, a service pistol and a small cutting torch. \nBISHOP This duct runs almost to the up-link assembly.  One hundred eighty meters.  Say, forty minutes to crawl down there.  One hour to patch in and align the antenna. Thirty minutes to prep the ship, then about fifty minutes flight time. \nRipley looks at her watch. \nRIPLEY It's going to be closer.  You better get going. \nBISHOP (cheerfully) See you soon. \nShe squirms into the shaft, pushing the equipment along ahead of him with a scraping rhythm.  The diameter of the conduit is barely larger than the width of his shoulders.  Vasquez slides a metal plate over the hole and begins spot welding it in place. \nINT. CONDUIT                                            131 \nBishop looks back as the welder seals him in.  He sighs fatalistically and squirms forward.  Ahead of him the conduit dwindles straight to seeming infinity.  Like being in the bore of a very long Howitzer. \nINT.

The flashes of the sentry guns flare out the sensitive video, but impressions of figures moving in the smoky corridor are occasionally visible.  The robot sentries hammer away, driving streamers of tracer fire into the swirling mist. \nHICKS Twenty meters and closing. Fifteen.  C and D guns down about fifty percent. \nThe digital readout whirl through descending numbers. An inhuman SHRILL SCREECHING is audible between bursts of fire. \nGORMAN All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I... \nRIPLEY Forget it. \nShe shoulders by him into the med lab.

Newt is curled up there, jammed as far back as she can get, fast asleep.  Still clutching \"Casey.\" \nRipley stares at Newt's tiny face, so angelic despite the demons that have chased her through her dreams and the reality between dreams.  Ripley lays the rifle on top of the cot and crawls carefully underneath.  Without waking the little girl, she slips her arms around her. \nRipley becomes merely the larger of two children huddling together in the darkness under their bed. \nNewt's face contorts with the externalization of some tormented dreamscape.  She cries out, a vague inarticulate plea.  Ripley rocks her gently. \nRIPLEY There, there.  Sssshh.  It's all right. \nEXT. Up-LINK TOWER - VIEW OF AP STATION                 139 \nA VIEW OF the processing station from the colony landing platform.  A rising wind is clearing out the low fog and the silhouette of the station grows sharper.  Several systems of high pressure conduits at the base of the conical tower are actually glowing dull red with heat in the darkness.  High voltage discharges arc around the upper latticework, lighting the blighted landscape with irregular glaring flashes. \nPAN ONTO BISHOP, F.G.  hunched against the wind at the base of the telemetry tower.  He has a TEST-BAY PANEL open and the portable terminal patched in.

OPERATING ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - MED LAB         141 \nas she awakens with a start.  She checks her watch... an hour has passed.  She gently disengages herself from Newt and is about to crawl out from beneath the cot when she sees something and FREEZES. \nAcross the room, just inside the door to the med lab, are two innocuous but nonetheless chilling objects. TWO STASIS CYLINDERS.  Their tops are hinged open, and the suspension fields are switched off.  They are both EMPTY.  Ripley feels a slow upwelling wave of terror rise through her in that silent frozen moment...the inescapable certainty of a lethal presence.  Unable to move or breathe, she looks around frantically, assessing the situation. \nRIPLEY (whispers) Newt.  Newt, wake up. \nNEWT Wah...?  Where are...? \nRIPLEY (whispers) Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble. \nNewt nods, now wide awake.  They listen in the darkness for the slightest betrayal of movement.  The scrabble of multiple legs across the polished floor, for example. \nThere is only the droning HUM of the little space heater. Ripley reaches up and, clutching the springs of the underside of the cot, begins to inch it away from the wall. \nThe SQUEAL OF METAL as the legs scrape across the floor is jarringly loud in the stillness. \nWhen the space is wide enough she cautiously slides herself up between the wall and the edge of the cot, reaching for the rifle she left lying on top of the mattress.  Here yes clear the edge of the bed.  The rifle is GONE. \nShe snaps her head around.  A SCUTTLING SHAPE LEAPS TOWARD HER from the foot of the bed!  She ducks with a startled cry.  The obscene thing hits the wall above her, legs moving lightning fast.  Reflexively she slams the bed against the wall, pinning the creature inches above her face.  Its legs and tail writhe with incredible ferocity and it emits a demented, piercing SQUEAL. \nRipley heaves Newt across the polished floor and in a frenzied scramble rolls from beneath the cot.  She flips it over, trapping the creature underneath. \nThey back away, gasping.  Ripley's eyes flash around the shadowed room where every corner of space between equipment holds lethal promise.  The creature scuttles from beneath the bed and disappears under a back of cabinets in a blur.  Ripley hugs Newt close and heads toward the door, moving as if every object in the room had a million volts running through it.  She reaches the door.  Hits the wall switch.  Nothing happens.  Disabled from outside.  She tries the lights. Nothing.  She pounds on the door.  The acoustically dampened door panel thunks dully.  She moves to the observation window, glancing frantically over her shoulder.  The bare floor behind her is like a screaming threat. \nRIPLEY (shouting) Hey...hey! \nShe pounds on the window.  Through the double thickness window we can SEE that the lab is dark and empty.  Ripley whirls, hearing a loathsome scrabbling behind her.  Newt starts to whimper, feeding off her fear.  She steps in front of the video surveillance camera and waves her arms in a circle. \nRIPLEY Hicks!  Hicks! \nINT.

Everyone stops in the sudden darkness, realizing instinctively it is a new escalation in the struggle.  Hicks looks at the board.  Everything is out. Doors.  Video screens. \nRIPLEY They cut the power. \nHUDSON What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals. \nRipley picks up her rifle and thumbs off the safety. \nRIPLEY Newt!  Stay close. (to the others) Let's get some trackers going. Come on, get moving.

Fall back to Operations. \nINT. CORRIDOR                                           149 \nHudson backtracks nervously, peering all around.  He looks stretched to the limit. \nHUDSON This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place... \nRIPLEY (voice over) Just get back here! \nHudson reaches the door to operations at a run, a moment before Vasquez.  They pull the door shut and lock it. \nINT. OPERATIONS                                         150 \nHudson joins Ripley and Hicks, who are laying out their armament.  Flamethrowers.  Grenades.  M-41A magazines. Hudson's tracker beeps.  Then again.  The tone continues through the SCENE, its rhythm increasing. \nHUDSON Movement!  Signal's clean. \nHe pans the scanner.  Stops.  The range display reads out, counting down. \nHUDSON Range twenty meters. \nRIPLEY (to Vasquez) Seal the door. \nVasquez picks up a hand-welder and moves to comply. \nHUDSON Seventeen meters. \nRIPLEY (indicating door) Locked. \nHICKS Stand back. \nHicks snaps the torch off his belt and cuts into the lock.  Inhuman shapes enter the far end of the corridor. Vasquez hands her flamethrower to Gorman and unslings her rifle.  She starts loading 30mm grenades into the launcher, like oversize 12-guage shells. \nGORMAN You can't use those in here! \nVASQUEZ Right.  Fire in the hole! \nShe pumps a round up and fires.  The grenade EXPLODES and the blast almost knocks them down.  Hicks kicks the door open, molten droplets flying. \nHICKS (shouting at Vasquez) Thanks a lot!  Now I can't hear shit. \nVASQUEZ (shouting) What? \nINT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      156 \nVasquez slides the door almost closed, then fires three grenades rapid-fire through the gap.  She slams the door home as the grenades detonate, the explosion sounding gonglike through the metal. \nRipley sprints across the room, trying the far door. Burke has locked it as well.  Hicks switches his hand-torch from CUT to WELD and starts sealing the door they just passed through. \nINT. MED LAB                                            157 \nBurke, hyperventilating with terror, backs across the dark chamber.  Gasping, almost paralyzed with fear, he crosses the chamber to the door leading to the main concourse.  His fingers reach for the latch.  It moves by itself.  The door opens slowly. \nON BURKE  his eyes wide, transfixed by his fate.  We hear the BULLWHIP CRACK of a tail-stinger striking as we: \nCUT TO: \nINT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      158 \nThe door dimples with a clanging impact, separating slightly from its frame.  Another crash, the squeal of tortured steel.  Newt grabs Ripley by the hand and tugs her across the room. \nNEWT Come on!  This way. \nShe leads Ripley to an air vent set low in the wall and expertly unlatches the grille, swinging it open.  Newt starts inside but Ripley pulls her back. \nRIPLEY Stay behind me. \nRipley trades her rifle for Gorman's flamethrower before he can protest and enters the air shaft, which is a tight fit.  Newt scrambles in behind, followed by Hicks, Gorman and Vasquez on rearguard.  Glancing back fearfully Newt pushes on Ripley's butt as they crawl rapidly through the shaft. \nNEWT Come on.  Crawl faster. \nRIPLEY DO you know how to get to the landing field from here? \nNEWT Sure.  Go left. \nRipley turns into a larger MAIN DUCT where there is enough room to crab-walk in a low crouch.  She runs, scraping her back on the ceiling.  The troopers' armor clatters in the confined space.  They approach an intersection.  She fires the flamethrower around the corner, the looks.  Clear. \nNEWT Go right. \nThey sprint into the narrow connecting duct, the maze becoming a blur.  Ripley fires the flamethrower periodically, as they pass side ducts covered by louvered grilles or vertical shafts going to higher or lower levels. \nHICKS (into headset) Bishop, you read me?  Come in, over. \nThere is a long pause then Bishop's VOICE, almost unintelligible with interference, comes over the radio. \nBISHOP (voice over; static) Yes, I read you.  Not very well... \nEXT. UP-LINK RELAY - LANDING FIELD                      159 \nBishop is huddled against the base of the telemetry mast, out of the wind which is now gusting viciously. \nBISHOP (yelling; over enunciating) The ship is on its way.  ETA about sixteen minutes.  I've got my hands full flying... the weather's come up a bit. \nBishop's fingers are blurring over the terminal keys and he squints, watching the screen as the flight telemetry updates rapidly. \nIn the b.g. the AP station has become a raging demon, wreathed in boiling steam and electrical discharges. \nINT. AIR DUCT                                           160 \nHICKS All right, stand by there.  We're on out way.  Over. \nThe beam of Ripley's light wavers hypnotically in the tunnel ahead.  She blinks, seeing something...not sure. A GLINTING OBSCENE FORM MOVING TOWARD THEM, filling the tunnel at the absolute limit of the light's power. \nRIPLEY Back.  Go back! \nThey try to crawl back, jamming together.  Behind them, the way they have come, a GRATING is battered in with a FEROCIOUS CLANG and the deadly silhouette of a warrior flows into the duct.  They are trapped.  Vasquez uses her flamethrower, bathing the tunnel in fire.  Hicks snaps out his hand-welder and cuts into the wall of the duct.  Molten metal spatters him, as sparks fill the tunnel with lurid light.  Vasquez' flamethrower sputters. \nRIPLEY Climb down, honey.  We have to cut through this grate. \nNewt backs away, climbing down the pipe as Hicks cuts into the bars with his hand-torch. \nINT. SUBBASEMENT                                        165 \nNewt, standing waist deep in the water, watches sparks shower blindingly as Hicks cuts.  She bites her lip, trembling.  Cold and terrified.  Silently a glistening shape rises in one graceful motion from the water behind her.  It stands, dripping, dwarfing her tiny form.  Newt turns, sensing the movement...She SCREAMS as the shadow engulfs her. \nINT. SERVICE TUNNEL                                     166 \nRipley panics, hearing screaming below, then splashing. She and Hicks kick desperately at the grating, smashing it down.  Heedless of the cherry-hot edges Ripley lunges into the hole with her light. \nRIPLEY Newt!  Newt! \nThe surface of the water reflects the beam placidly. Newt is gone.  Bobbing in the water, eyes staring, is \"Casey\" the doll head.  In sinks slowly, distorting, vanishing in darkness. \nHicks pulls Ripley away from the hole.  She struggles furiously, trying to tear out of his grip. \nRIPLEY No!  Noooo! \nHe drags her back.  It takes all of his strength. \nHICKS (intense) She's gone!  Let's go! \nHe sees something moving toward them through a lattice of pipes.  Ripley is irrational.  Hysterical. \nRIPLEY No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to -- \nHICKS All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now! \nHe drags her toward an ELEVATOR not far away at the end of the tunnel.  Gets her inside, slamming her against the back wall.  Hits the button to go to surface level. An alien warrior leaps into the tunnel, starts toward them.  The doors are closing.  Not fast enough. The creature gets one arm through, the doors closing on it.  THEY OPEN AGAIN, an automatic safety feature.  THE WARRIOR HISSES, LUNGING.  Hicks FIRES, POINT-BLANK.  It spins away, SCREECHING.  Acid sluices between the closing doors, across Hicks' armored chest plate, as he shields Ripley with his body.  The lift starts upward.  Hicks' fingers race with the clasps as the stuff eats its way toward his skin.  Galvanized out of her hysteria, Ripley claws at his armor, helping him as much as she can.  He screams as the acid contacts his chest and arm.  He shucks out of the combat armor like a madman, dropping the smoking pieces to the floor.  Acrid fumes fill the air, searing eyes and lungs.  The elevator stops.  The doors part and they stumble out, Ripley supporting Hicks who is doubled over in agony. \nRIPLEY Come on, you can make it. Almost there. \nEXT. LANDING FIELD                                      167 \nDrop-ship two descends toward the landing grid, side-slipping in hurricane gusts.  Bishop stands, guiding it with the portable terminal.  The ship sets down hard. Slides sideways.  Stops.  Bishop turns as Ripley and Hicks stumble out of a doorway in the colony building behind him.  He goes to them, helping to support Hicks and they run toward the ship, buffeted by the gale. Ripley shouts, her words barely audible over the wind. \nRIPLEY HOW MUCH TIME? \nBISHOP PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES! \nRIPLEY WE'RE NOT LEAVING! \nThe loading ramp deploys and they run into the ship. \nEXT. PROCESSING STATION                                 168 \nAn infernal engine, roaring out of control.  Steam blasts and swirls, lightning zaps around the superstructure and columns of incandescent gas thunder hundreds of feet into the air. \nWe APPROACH, hypnotically.  The drop-ship ENTERS FRAME, moving toward the station.  It pivots, hovering in the blasting turbulence, and settles onto a NARROW LANDING PLATFORM ten levels above the ground, or about a third of the way up the enormous structure. \nINT. DROP-SHIP                                          169 \nRipley finishes winding tape around a bulky object and drops the roll.  She has crudely fastened a M-41A assault rifle together, side by side, with a flamethrower. A massive, unwieldy package of absolute firepower.  Her movements are curt, precise...determined.  She works rapidly, snatching magazines, grenades, belts and other gear from the fully stocked ordnance racks of the drop-ship. \nBishop comes aft from the pilot's compartment to help Hicks dress his injuries.  Hicks is sprawled in a flight seat, the contents of a FIELD MEDICAL KEY strewn around him.  He's out of the game...contorted with pain. \nBISHOP Ripley... \nRIPLEY She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it. \nBISHOP In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska. \nRipley is stuffing gear rapidly into a satchel, her hands flying. \nRIPLEY Hicks, don't let him leave. \nHICKS (grimacing with pain) We ain't going anywhere. \nShe hefts the hybrid weapon, grabs the satchel and spins to the door controls.  The door opens.  Wind and machine-thunder blast in. \nRIPLEY See you, Hicks. \nHicks is holding a wad of gauze plastered over his face. \nHICKS Dwayne.  It's Dwayne. \nRipley grabs his hand.  They share a moment, albeit brief.  Mutual respect in the valley of death. \nLashing in a frenzy, the QUEEN DETACHES FROM THE EGG SAC, ripping away and dragging torn cartilage and tissue behind it.  SEEN DIMLY THROUGH swirling smoke, it rises on its powerful legs and steps forward. \nINT. CATACOMBS - CORRIDOR                               178- \nRipley uses the flamethrower ahead of her, firing bursts of pulse-rifle fire down side corridors at indistinct shapes and shadows.  The weapon is empty when she reaches the freight elevators.  A mass of debris, falling down the shaft from a higher level, has demolished the life cage she descended in.  She slams the control for the other cage and hears the sound of the LIFT MOTOR'S WHINE as it begins its slow descent from several levels up.  AN ENRAGED SCREECH ECHOES in the corridor.  Ripley sees a silhouette moving in the smoke...a glistening black shape which FILLS THE CORRIDOR TO THE CEILING...THE QUEEN.  Her last cartridge is reading zeroes.  The flamethrower sputters uselessly when she tries that. The grenades are gone.  Ripley drops the weapon and looks up the shaft to the descending lift...then at the approaching FIGURE.  The elevator won't be in time. She runs to a ladder set in the wall as a horrendous screech beats in her ears.  She scrambles up the rungs. \nINT. SECOND LEVEL                                       180 \nRipley struggles up through a narrow hatch, Newt clinging to her.  She dives aside as a POWERFUL BLACK ARM shoots up through the opening, its razor claws slamming into the grille-floor inches from her.  Looking down through the grille she sees the great horrifying jaws directly below her, wet and leering.  She scrambles up, running, as the grille-floor lifts and buckles behind her with the titanic force of the creature below. It hurls itself with insane ferocity against the metal, pacing her from below as she runs. \nINT. STAIRWELL                                          181 \nRipley reaches an open-grid emergency stairwell and sprints upward.  It rocks and shudders with the station's death throes. \nVOICE You now have two minutes to reach minimum safe distance. \nINT. CORRIDOR - ELEVATORS                               182- \nThe lift reaches bottom, the doors rolling open. The Queen turns and freezes, as if contemplating the open lift cage. \nINT. STAIRWELL                                          184 \nRipley stumbles, smashing her knees against the metals stairs.  As she rises she hears the LIFT MOTORS start up.  Looking down through the lattice work of the station she sees the life cage start ominously upward.  She knows there is only one explanation for that.  She runs on, the stairwell becoming a crazy whirl around her. \nEXT. LANDING PLATFORM                                   185 \nRipley, with Newt still clinging to her, slams through the door opening onto the platform. Through wind-whipped streamers of smoke she sees...THE SHIP IS GONE. \nRIPLEY BISHOP! \nHer shouts become inarticulate screams of hatred, outrage at the final betrayal.  She scans the sky. Nothing. \nRIPLEY (hysterical) BISHOP! \nNewt is sobbing. \nThe lift rises ponderously INTO VIEW.  Ripley turns, backing away from the doors toward the railing.  There is no place to run to on the platform.  EXPLOSIONS detonate in the complex far below and huge fireballs swell upward through the machinery.  The platform bucks wildly.  Nearby a cooling tower collapses with a THUNDEROUS ROAR and the SHRIEK OF RENDING STEEL.  More EXPLOSIONS, one after another, rocketing up from below. Ripley stares transfixed as the lift stops.  The safety cage parts. \nRIPLEY (to Newt; low) Close your eyes, baby. \nThe lift doors begin to open.  A glimpse of the apparition within. \nANGLE ON RIPLEY AND NEWT  as the drop-ship RISES RIGHT BEHIND THEM, its hovering jets roaring. \nVOICE You now have thirty seconds to reach... \nRipley leaps for the loading boom projecting down from the cargo bay and it raises them into the ship.  A TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE COMPLEX nearby, slamming the ship sideways.  Its extended landing legs foul in a tangle of conduit, grinding with a hideous squeal of metal on metal. \nINT./EXT. DROP-SHIP - STATION                           186- \nRipley leaps into a seat with Newt, cradling her.  Begins strapping in.  Bishop wrestles with the controls.  The landing legs retract, ripping free.  Ripley slams her seat harness latches home. \nRIPLEY Punch it, Bishop! \nThe entire lower level of the station disappears in a fireball.  The air vibrates with intense heat waves and concussion.  The drop-ship engines fire.  Ripley is slammed back in her seat.  The ship vaults out and up, Bishop standing it on its tail, pouring on the gees. Ripley and Newt see everything shake into a blur. \nEXT. STRATOSPHERE                                       188 \nThe drop-ship lunges up and out of the cloud layer into the clear high night.  Below, the clouds light up from beneath from horizon to horizon. \nA SUN HOT DOME OF ENERGY bursts up through the cloud layer, WHITING OUT THE FRAME.  The tiny ship is slammed by the shockwave, tossed forward...and climbs, scorched but functioning, toward the stars. \nINT. DROP-SHIP                                          189 \nRipley and Newt watch the blinding glare fade away and they sit, wide-eyed, trembling, realizing they are finally and truly safe.  Newt starts to cry quietly, and Ripley strokes her hair. \nRIPLEY It's okay, baby.  We made it.  It's over. \nINT. SULACO CARGO LOCK - IN ORBIT - LATER               190 \nThe scorched and battered ship once again sits in its drop-bay, steam blasting from cooling vents beside the engine.  Rotating clearance lights sweep the dark chamber hypnotically. \nINT. DROP-SHIP                                          191 \nBishop stands behind Ripley as she kneels beside a comatose Hicks. \nBISHOP I gave him a shot, for the pain. We'll need to get a stretcher to cart him up to medical. \nRipley nods and, picking up Newt, precedes Bishop down the aisle to the loading ramp. \n", "test1_input": "RIPLEY You always think you can make it up to somebody...later, you know. But now I never can.  I never can. \nLet's get one thing straight...Ripley can be one tough lady.  But the terror, the loss, the emptiness are, in this moment, overwhelming.  She cries silently. \nBurke puts a reassuring hand on her arm. \nBURKE (gently) The hearing convenes at 0930.  You don't want to be late. \nINT. CORRIDOR - GATEWAY                                   5 \nElevator doors part and Ripley emerges, in mid-conversation with Burke.  DOLLYING AHEAD OF THEM as they move rapidly down the corridor. \nRIPLEY You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate. \nBURKE Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys... \nRIPLEY I get the picture. \nBURKE Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - ON RIPLEY - GATEWAY                6 \nShe's not cool.  Not unemotional. \nRIPLEY Do you people have earwax, of what?  We have been here three hours.  How many different ways do you want me to tell the same story? \nShe faces the EIGHT MEMBERS of the board of inquiry at a long conference table.  Gray suits and grim faces.  They aren't buying.  Behind Ripley on a large VIDEO SCREEN, PARKER grins like a goon from his personnel mugshot.  His file prints out next to it.  BRETT's face and dossier replace it, and then the others as the SCENE continues... KANE, LAMBERT, ASH the android traitor, DALLAS. VAN LEUWEN, the ICC representative, steeples his fingers and frowns. \nVAN LEUWEN Look at it from our perspective. You freely admit to detonating the engines of, and thereby destroying, an M-Class star-freighter.  A rather expensive piece of hardware... \nINSURANCE INVESTIGATOR (dryly) Forty-two million in adjusted dollars. That's minus payload, of course. \nVAN LEUWEN The shuttle's flight recorder corroborates some elements of your account.  That the Nostromo set down on LV-426, an unsurveyed planet, at that time.  That repairs were made.  That it resumed its course and was subsequently set for self-destruct.  By you.  For reasons unknown. \nRIPLEY Look, I told you... \nVAN LEUWEN It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up. \nRipley sense the noose tightening. \nRIPLEY Then somebody's gotten to it... doctored the recorder.  Who had access to it? \nThe ECA (Extrasolar Colonization Administration) Representative (ECA REP) just shakes his head. \nECA REP Would you just listen to yourself for one minute. \nRipley glares at the ECA Rep, a woman on the ungenerous side of fifty.  Van Leuwen sighs with exasperation. \nVAN LEUWEN The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe... \nRIPLEY (losing it) That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock! (pause) Like I said. \nINSURANCE MAN (to ECA Rep) Are there any species like this 'hostile organism' on LV-426? \nECA REP No.  It's a rock.  No indigenous life larger than a simple virus. \nRipley grits her teeth in frustration. \nRIPLEY I told you, it wasn't indigenous. There was an alien spacecraft there. A derelict ship.  We homed on its beacon... \nECA REP To be perfectly frank, we've surveyed over three hundred worlds and no one's ever reported a creature which, using your words... (read from Ripley's statement) ...'gestates in a living human host' and has 'concentrated molecular acid for blood.' \nRipley glances at Burke, silent at the far end of the table.  His expression is grim.  Her mouth hardens as a bit of the old nail-eating Ripley surfaces. \nRIPLEY Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise... \nVAN LEUWEN Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be... \nRIPLEY (louder, stepping on him) ...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching... \nVan Leuwen stands, out of patience. \nVAN LEUWEN Thank you, that will be all. \nRipley stares him down, glowering at the board. \nRIPLEY That's not all, Goddamnit!  If those things get back here, that will be all.  Then you can just kiss it good-bye, Jack!  Just kiss it goodbye. \nRipley turns sharply away, trembling with frustration and anger.  Dallas looks back at her from the video screen, his eyes burning from the photograph, as we: \n", "test1_true": "INT. CORRIDOR                                             7 \nRipley kicks the wall next to Burke who is getting coffee and donuts at a vending machine. \nBURKE You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo. \nRIPLEY They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case. \nBURKE (cheerfully) You are a head case.  Have a donut. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - LATER            8 \nVan Leuwen clears his throat. \nVAN LEUWEN It is the finding of this board of inquiry that Warrent Officer Ellen Ripley, NOC-14672. has acted with questionable judgment and is unfit to hold an ICC license as a commercial flight officer. \nBurke watches Ripley taking it on the chin, white-lipped but subdued. \nVAN LEUWEN Said license is hereby suspended indefinitely.  No criminal charges will be filed at this time and you are released on own recognizance for a six month period of psychometric probation, to include monthly review by an ICC psychiatric tech... \nINT. CORRIDOR                                             9 \nDOLLY BACK as the conference room door bangs open and Ripley strides through.  She shrugs off Burke's restraining arm and catches up to Van Leuwen walking down the corridor. \nRIPLEY (insistent) Why won't you check out LV-426? \nVAN LEUWEN (condescendingly) Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now. \nRIPLEY What are you talking about. What people? \nVan Leuwen steps into an elevator with some others, but Ripley holds the door from closing. \nVAN LEUWEN Terraformers...planet engineers. It's what we call a shake 'n' bake colony.  They set up atmosphere processors to make the air breathable...big job.  Takes decades.  They've already been there over twenty years.  Peacefully. \nThe door tries to close.  Ripley slams it back.  People are getting annoyed. \nRIPLEY How many colonists? \nVAN LEUWEN Sixty, maybe seventy families. \nRIPLEY (low) Sweet Jesus. \nELEVATOR PASSENGER Do you mind? \nRipley's hand slides off the door, strengthless. \nTIGHT ON HER  FROM INSIDE the elevator as the doors close like fate on her lost expression. \nEXT. ALIEN LANDSCAPE - DAY                               10 \nA hideous, storm-blasted vista.  Tortured rock forms. Bleak twilight at midday. \nPAN SLOWLY ONTO a CORRODED METAL SIGN set in concrete pylons, which reads: \nHADLEY'S HOPE - POP. 159 \"WELCOME TO ACHERON\" \nSome local has added below in spray-can graffiti \"Have a nice day.\"  Gale-force wind SCREECHES around the steel sign, driving a freezing rain. \nThe COLONY, b.g., is a squat complex with lots of floodlights. \nEXT. COLONY COMPLEX                                      11 \nThe town is a cluster of bunkerlike metal and concrete buildings connected by conduits.  Neon signs throw garish colors across the vaultlike walls, advertising bars and other businesses.  It looks like a sodden cross between the Krupps munitions works and a truckstop casino in the Nevada boondocks. \nHuge-wheeled tractors crawl toadlike in the rutted \"street\" and vanish down rampways to underground garages. \nANGLE ON THE CONTROL BLOCK  the largest structure.  It resembles vaguely the superstructure of an aircraft carrier...a flying bridge. \nVISIBLE across a half kilometer of barren heath, b.g., is the massive complex of the nearest ATMOSPHERE PROCESSOR, looking like a power plant bred with an active volcano.  Its fiery glow pulses in the low cloud cover like a steel mill. \nINT. MAIN CONCOURSE - NEAR CONTROL BLOCK                 12 \nA central space, laid out like a scaled-down shopping mall with no styling flourishes.  We SEE a cross section of the types of people who have come to live on Godforsaken Acheron.  Tough.  Pragmatic.  \"Grapes of Wrath\" faces.  Calloused hands.  Not too many interior decorators.  Some children race in the corridor on things that look suspiciously like \"Big Wheels.\" \nINT. OPERATIONS ROOM - CONTROL BLOCK                     13 \nJammed with computer terminals, technicians, displays... most of the business of running the colony flows through here.  It's high tech but used and scrungy.  Papers piled up.  Coffee cup rings. \nDOLLY AHEAD OF LYDECKER, the Assistant Operations Manager, as he catches up to the harried Operating Manager, SIMPSON. \n", "test1_id": 453, "test2_input": "An unconscious segregation takes place at the troopers assemble at one long table while Gorman, Burke, Bishop and Ripley sit at another.  Everybody is nursing a coffee, waiting for eggs from the AUTOCHEF.  Among the troopers dress discipline is lax...fatigues customized and emblazoned with patches.  Drake's tunic is cut off to a vest and has \"Eat the apple and fuck the Corps\" stenciled on back.  \"Peace Through Superior Firepower,\" \"Pray for War\" and \"I've Served My Time in Hell:  Cetti Epsilon NC-104\" are some others. \nHUDSON Hey, 'Top.'

Got a corn cob up his ass, definitely. \nAcross the room, at the other table, Gorman sits with his creases perfect...the consummate strack NCO.  Bishop takes a seat beside Ripley, who pointedly gets up and moves to the far side of the table.  He looks wounded. \nBISHOP I'm sorry you feel that way about Synthetics, Ripley. \nRipley spins on Burke, her tone accusing. \nRIPLEY You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not? \nBURKE Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board. \nBISHOP I prefer the term 'artificial person' myself.  Is there a problem? \nBURKE A synthetic malfunctioned on her last trip out.  Some deaths were involved. \nBISHOP I'm shocked.  Was it an older model? \nBURKE Cyberdyne Systems 120-A/2. \nBishop turns to Ripley, very conciliatory. \nBISHOP Well, that explains it.  The A/2's were always a bit twitchy. That could never happen now with out behavioral inhibitors.  Impossible for me to harm or, by omission of action, allow to be harmed a human being. (smiling) More cornbread? \nWHAM!  Ripley knocks the plate out of his hand, halfway across the room. \nRIPLEY Just stay away from me, Bishop! You got that straight? \nBurke and Gorman exchange glances. \nWierzbowski, at the next table, shrugs and turns back to the other troopers. \nWIERZBOWSKI She don't like the cornbread either. \nINT.

Gorman enters with Burke and Ripley. \nGORMAN At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but... \nHUDSON Sir? \nGORMAN (annoyed) Yes, Hicks? \nHUDSON Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks. \nGORMAN What's the question? \nHUDSON Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt? \nGORMAN All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved. \nWIERZBOWSKI A what? \nHICKS (to Wierzbowski; low) It's a bug-hunt. (louder) So what are these things? \nGorman nods to Ripley, who stands before the troops. She sets some RECORDING DISKETTES on the table. \nRIPLEY I've dictated what I know on these. \nAPONE Tease us a bit. \n", "test2_true": "RIPLEY Okay.  It's important to understand this organism's life cycle.  It's actually two creatures.  The first form hatches from a spore...a sort of large egg, and attaches itself to its victim.  Then it injects an embryo, detaches and dies. It's essentially a walking sex organ. The -- \nHUDSON Sounds like you, Hicks. \nRIPLEY (controlled) The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it... (with difficulty) ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly -- \nVASQUEZ I only need to know one thing. \nRIPLEY Yes? \nVASQUEZ Where they are. \nVasquez coolly points her finger, cocks her thumbs, and blows away an imaginary alien. \nDRAKE Yo!  Vasquez.  Kick ass! \nVASQUEZ Anytime.  Anywhere. \nHUDSON Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up. \nVASQUEZ Fuck you. \nHUDSON Anytime.  Anywhere. \nRIPLEY (icy) Am I disturbing you conversation Mr. Hudson? \nHudson settles down, smirking.  Ripley locks eyes with Vasquez. \nRIPLEY I hope you're right.  I really do. \nBURKE (to all) I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you. \nGORMAN Are there any questions?  Hudson? \nHUDSON How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit? \nGorman scowls then, thanking Ripley with a nod, takes over the predrop briefing. \nGORMAN All right.  I want this to go smooth and by the numbers.  I want DCS and tactical database assimilation by 0830. (some groans) Ordnance loading, weapons strip and drop-ship prep details will have seven hours... \nEXT. SPACE - ACHERON                                     34 \nThey have arrived.  From orbit the planet looks serene ...Pearlescent cloud cover masking the environmental torment beneath.  The SULACO floats, its MANEUVERING JETS FIRING.  A bluish glow.  Then twice more, rapidly. \nINT. BRIDGE                                              35 \nBishop is installed in his command seat, hemmed in by instrumentation. \nBISHOP (into mike) Attention.  This concluded final maneuvering operations.  Thank you for your cooperation.  You may resume work. \nINT. LOADING BAY - TIGHT ON MASSIVE FORKS - CARGO LOCK   34 \nsliding into a heavy ordnance rack with an echoing CLANG.  PULL BACK as the rack of tactical missiles is lifted, REVEALING two powerful hydraulic arms. \nSpunkmeyer, seated inside a POWER LOADER, swings the ordnance up into a belly nacelle of the DROP-SHIP where it locks into place.  As he exerts pressure with his hands against the servo-controls the hydraulic arms move correspondingly...but with a thousandfold increase in power.  The forklift-style CLAWS on each arm can crush with tons of pressure.  The loader has an open ROLL CAGE to protect the operator, and is supported by squat HYDRAULIC LEGS which also move correspondingly with the driver's movements. \nYou have never seen anything like this before. Advanced as it is to us, it's only an old forklift to them...battered and well used.  Covered with grease. Repainted many times.  Across the back is stencilled \"CATERPILLAR.\" \nSpunkmeyer's machine swings out from under the drop-ship and we become aware of the intense activity throughout the cavernous loading bay.  Troopers on foot or driving TOW-MOWERS, OVERHEAD LOADING ARMS...all in motion. Hicks checks off items on an electronic manifest. \nINT. READY ROOM - ARMORY                                 37 \nWierzbowski, Drake and Vasquez are fieldstripping light weapons with precise movements.  Around them, in racks, is an arsenal of advanced personal artillery. \nVasquez likes the feel of the guns, the weight...the authority.  Her hands move without hesitation.  CLACK. CLACK.  CLACK.  She swings one of the SMART-GUNS out on a work stand.  Using a body brace and GYRO-STABILIZED SUPPORT ARM, it is a computer-aimed, video targeted automatic weapon.  The futuristic equivalent of a .30 caliber light machine gun.  Sort of a steadicam that kills. \nINT. LOADING BAY - ANGLE ON BURKE AND GORMAN             38 \nwith pre-flight activity b.g. \nBURKE Still nothing from the colony? \nGORMAN Dead on all channels. \nRipley watches the drop-ship being loaded.  A cross between a Huey Aircobra gunship and the space shuttle might describe it.  An orbit-to-surface troop carrier, heavily armed for the close support of ground missions. She watches a six-wheeled APC, ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER, being raised hydraulically into the ship's belly.  Ripley looks around as Frost wheels a rack of incomprehensible equipment toward her. \nFROST Clear, please. \nRipley jumps aside, nodding apologetically.  She turns. Steps hastily back.  Hudson cruises by with a laden forklift. \n", "test2_id": 454, "test3_input": "Vasquez rips off her headset.  She is riveted to the targetting screen, moving ferret-quick in a pivoting dance.

Wierzbowski's monitor breaks up. His life signs plummet.

DO IT NOW! \nGORMAN Shut up.  Just shut up! \nCRASH!  Crowe's telemetry cuts off like the plug was pulled.  Flat line. \nGORMAN Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over. \nAPONE (voice over; heavy static) Say again?  All after incinerators? \nRipley watches it fall apart. \nGORMAN I said... \nINT.

A SCREAM. Apone whirls, uncertain. \nAPONE Dietrich?  Crowe?  Sound off!  Wierzbowski? \nNothing.  He spins.  Almost blows Hudson's head off. \nHUDSON (freaked) We're getting juked!  We're gonna die in here! \nApone hands him a magazine.  Hudson slaps it home, looking truly terrified. \nAPONE Yeah.  Right.  Right!  Fuck the heat exchanger! \nHe FIRES.  Vasquez, nearby, is laying down a horrendous field of fire.  Strobe-bright flashes sear the darkness.  She pivots, firing mechanically in controlled bursts.  Scoring points in her own private video game. \nShe SPINS as Hicks approached laterally.  WHAM!  She fires \"at\" him.  Hicks whirls...to see a nightmarish figure right behind him, catapulted backwards by Vasquez' blast. \nINT.

Do something! \nBut he's gone.  Total brain-lock. \nTIGHT ON RIPLEY  as she struggles with a decision. She's terrified...of what she knows she's about to do.  But more than that, she's furious.  Shouldering past a paralyzed Gorman she runs up the aisle of the APC. \nRIPLEY (in passing) Newt, put your seatbelt on! \nRipley jumps into the driver's seat of the APC.  Takes a deep breath.  Starts slapping switches. \nGORMAN Ripley, what the hell...? \nShe slams the tractor into gear. \nEXT.

She slams the left and right drive-wheel actuators viciously, spinning the machine in a roaring pivot. Gorman lunges forward along the aisle, abandoning his command center. \nGORMAN (shrill) What are you doing?  Turn around!  That's an order! \n", "test3_true": "INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                    100 \nThe APC roars down into the smoky structure, tearing away outcroppings of alien-encrustation.  Ripley hits the floodlights.  Strobe-beacon.  Siren.  She homes on the flash of weapons fire ahead. \nINT. COCOON CHAMBER                                     101 \nThe APC crashes inside, showering debris.  Hicks, supporting a limping Hudson, appears out of the smoke. The APC pulls up broadside and Burke gets the crew-door open. \nDrake and Vasquez back out of the dense mist, firing as they fall back. \nDrake goes empty, slams the buckles cutting loose his smart-gun harness, and unslings a flame thrower. \nHicks pushes Hudson inside, leaps in after him and drags Vasquez inside, massive gear and all.  She sees a DARK SHAPE lunge toward Drake.  She fires one burst, prone.  Clean body hit. \nThe flash lights up the hideous inhuman grin, blowing open the thing's thorax.  A spray of BRIGHT YELLOW ACID slashes across Drake's face and chest, eating into him like a hot knife through butter.  He drops in boiling smoke, reflexively triggering his flame thrower. \nThe jet of liquid fire arcs around as he falls, engulfing the back half of the APC. \nINT. APC                                                102 \nVasquez rolls aside as a gout of napalm shoots through the crew-door, setting the interior on fire. Hicks is rolling the door closed when Vasquez lunges, clawing out the opening.  He stops her, dragging her inside. \nVASQUEZ Drake!  He's down! \nHicks screams right in her face. \nHICKS He's gone!  Forget it, he's gone! \nVASQUEZ (irrational) No.. No, he's not.  He's -- \nBurke and Hudson help him drag her from the door. \nHICKS (to Ripley) Let's go! \nRipley jams reverse.  Nails the throttle.  The APC bellows backward up the ramp.  Hudson disappears under a pile of equipment as a storage rack breaks free.  Hicks gets the door almost closed.  Suddenly CLAWS appear at the edge.  Newt screams.  Against the combined efforts of Hicks, Burke and Vasquez the door is being SLOWLY WRENCHED OPEN FROM OUTSIDE. Hicks yells at a paralyzed Gorman. \nHICKS Get on the Goddamn door! \nGorman backs away, eyes wide.  Hicks jams his shoulder against the latching lever and frees one hand to raise his 12-gauge.  An alien head wedges through the opening, its hideous mouth opening.  And Hicks jams his SHOTGUN MUZZLE between its jaws and pulls the trigger!  BLAM! The creature is flung backward, its shattered head fountaining acid blood.  The spray eats into the door, the deck, hits Hudson on the arm.  He shrieks.  They slide the door home and dog it tight. \nEXT. APC                                                103 \nThe armored vehicle roars backward up the ramp.  Slams into a mass of conduit.  Tears free.  Ripley works the shifters, pivoting the massive machine.  Everybody's shouting, trying to put out the fire.  Pandemonium. \nINT./EXT. APC                                           104- \nSomething lands on the roof with a metallic clang. \nGorman has plastered himself against a wall, as far from the door as possible.  A latch lever behind his head turns.  The small hatch against which he was leaning is ripped away and SOMETHING snatches him out the opening  He disappears to the waist with a shriek, legs kicking.  The alien clings to the roof, pulling him out.  Its tail whips over, scorpionlike, and buries a four inch stinger in Gorman's shoulder. Hicks grabs a joy stick at the FIRE-CONTROL CONSOLE and turns it rapidly.  On the roof the alien looks up as servo-motors whir.  A remote control turret cannon, a 20mm chain-gun, swivels toward it in a curt arc. VOOM.  The creature is blasted off the vehicle's armored back and tumbles away.  Gorman, slumped unconscious, is dragged back inside. \nThe APC rips away a section of catwalk and heads for clear air, its flank trailing fire like a comet. Ripley fights the controls as the big machine slews, broadsiding a control-room out-building.  Office furniture and splintered wall sections are strewn in the APC's wake. \nSuddenly, an alien arm arcs down, right in front of Ripley's face.  It smashes the windshield.  Glistening, hideous jaws lunge inside... \nRipley recoils.  Face to face once again with the same mind-numbing horror.  She reacts instinctively.  Slams both sets of brakes with all her strength.  The huge wheels lock.  The creature flips off, landing in the headlights.  Ripley hits full throttle.  The APC roars forward, smashing over the abomination.  Its skeletal body is crushed under the massive wheels.  It rolls, tumbling...lost in the darkness behind as the machine thunders onto the causeway and away from the station. \nA sound like bolts dropped in a meat grinder is coming from the APC's rear end.  Hicks eases Ripley's hand back on the throttle lever.  Her grip is white knuckled. \nHICKS It's okay...we're clear.  We're clear.  Ease up. \nThe grinding clatter becomes deafening even as she slows the machine. \nHICKS Sounds like a blown transaxle. You're just grinding metal. \nEXT.

Where's Newt? \nFeeling a tug at her pants leg she looks down.  Newt is wedged into a tiny space between the driver's seat and a bulkhead.  She is trembling, and looks terrified, but it's not the basket case catatonia of before. \nRIPLEY You okay? \nNewt gives her a THUMBS-UP, wan but stoic.  Ripley goes back to the others.  Hudson is holding his arm and staring in stunned dismay at nothing, playing it all back in his mind. \n", "test3_id": 455}

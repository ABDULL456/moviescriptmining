What's there? 
RILEY 
Powder magazine. Where they keep the big boomers. Rockets. For Dead Reckoning's cannons. 
INT. SHED - 10TH STREET PIER - NIGHT 
MOUSE looks at a GRIMY WINDOW as the SHADOW of a WALKER stops just beyond the glass. Mouse FIRES a BURST shattering the window and dropping the Walker. Silence. Mouse takes a tentative step toward the window. A SCRATCHING SOUND. SOMETHING climbs up onto the sill from outside. Mouse raises his gun, but hesitates when he sees... ...it's a child. A GIRL SCOUT. It died at age nine, still wearing its uniform. Now, it's voracious. It grabs Mouse's gun-hand. The weapon FIRES harmlessly into the floor. Mouse is about to be chomped when... ...a STALAGMITE OF GLASS in the top of the shattered window drops, PIERCING the Girl Scout's head. Mouse runs SCREAMING to the door, where he is grabbed by another DEAD THING. And another. As he is TORN APART, he sees 
that there are DOZENS MORE. 
EXT. RIVER - NIGHT 
CRANE UP TO REVEAL: 
...AN ARMY OF THE DEAD LINING THE RIVERBANK FOR AS FAR AS THE 
EYE CAN SEE. 
CLOSE ON: BIG DADDY. Only the river now flows between he and his goal: FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE, so near and yet so far. 
INT. KAUFMAN PENTHOUSE - NIGHT 
WHAM! The door SLAMS behind KAUFMAN as he enters the foyer. KNIPP emerges from the rear. 
KNIPP 
Any word from Mister Denbo, sir? 
KAUFMAN 
No. Pack us up. We might have to be leaving. 
KNIPP 
In the helicopters? 
KAUFMAN 
We'll only need one of them. 
INT/EXT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT 
PRETTY BOY eases the vehicle up the road to the complex of buildings: ROSS PARK, a sprawling munitions depot. The searchlight continues to sweep across the night, but NO ONE is manning it. It's mounted to an automatic rotator on the roof of the main building. 
FOXY 
Looks like no one's here. The gates stand wide open. There's no sign of life. 
CHOLO punches a button. The SIDE HATCH HISSES OPEN. 
CHOLO 
Foxy. You're elected. Get out there and see what the fuck. 
Foxy moves out through the open hatch. 
CHOLO (CONT'D) 
Somebody go out and help. 
SCAR grabs his weapons. 
SCAR 
I'll go. 
EXT. RIVER - NIGHT 
ONE OF THE DEAD TOPPLES face first into the water, dropping out of sight. ANOTHER FALLS. BIG DADDY looks at the spot where his brothers fell in. He looks for a long time, cocking his head like a puppy trying to understand a high wind. The first Dead Thing slowly rises out of the water. Then the Second. They stand, waist deep, in the shallows. Big Daddy gazes down at the water, a concept dawning. Then, with grim purpose, he steps deliberately off the low wall. Hitting the river, he manages to stay on his feet. Standing, waist deep, with the others, he scoops up water with his one good hand. Sniffs it. Tastes it. He looks up. Sees the CITY LIGHTS REFLECTED ON THE RIVER. He tries to express his thoughts. All that comes from his mouth is a series of inarticulate moans. He's incapable of transmitting his idea. So he does what he's been doing since Uniontown. He leads. He walks toward the city. Out of the shallows. Into deep water. Over his head. 
INT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT 
There are AUTOMOBILE TIRES, GARBAGE CANS, a rusted ANCHOR, a sunken MOTOR BOAT, HUNDREDS of BEER BOTTLES...AND THOUSANDS OF DEAD THINGS...WALKING...ON THE RIVER BOTTOM...following BIG DADDY through the debris. 
INT. TENEMENT - NIGHT 
A knock on a door is answered by A MAN who looks a bit too greasy to be important. SUTHERLAND is outside. 
SUTHERLAND 
How much is Kaufman paying you and your men? 
GREASY MAN 
Four hundred a day. Each. 
STYLES 
I'll pay you five thousand a day. Each. 
EXT. T-BIRD - NIGHT 
The car speeds down the road with SLACK at the wheel. 
INT. T-BIRD - NIGHT 
RILEY looks at his watch. 11:40.

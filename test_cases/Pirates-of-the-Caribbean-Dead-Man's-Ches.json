You look beautiful. \nELIZABETH SWANN I think it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding. \n[marines cross their long axes to bar Governor from entering] \n[Beckett, in white hair and curls, is standing with Mercer] \nLORD CUTLER BECKETT Governor Weatherby Swann, it's been too long. \nLORD CUTLER BECKETT His Lord now... actually. \nLORD CUTLER BECKETT In fact, I *do*. Mister Mercer! The warrant for the arrest of one William Turner. \nLORD CUTLER BECKETT Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake. Arrest her. \nELIZABETH SWANN On what charges? \nWILL TURNER No! \n[Beckett takes another document from Mercer, who is standing with Beckett, craggy face and pony tail] \nLORD CUTLER BECKETT Ah-ha! Here's the one for William Turner. And I have another one for a Mister James Norrington. Is he present? \nELIZABETH SWANN *What are the charges?* \nLORD CUTLER BECKETT I don't believe that's the answer to the question I asked. \nWILL TURNER Lord Beckett! In the category of questions *not* answered... \nELIZABETH SWANN We are under the jurisdiction of the King's governor of Port Royal, and you will tell us what we are charged with. \nLORD CUTLER BECKETT For which the punishment, regrettably, is *also* death. Perhaps you remember a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow. \nCREW Aye. \nAye. \nGIBBS All in all, it's seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating. \nJACK SPARROW Shiny? \nGIBBS Aye, shiny. \nJACK SPARROW Is that how you're all feeling, then? Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving your best interests as captain? \nCOTTON'S PARROT Awk! Walk the plank! \n[Jack grabs his pistol and points it at the bird] \nJACK SPARROW What did the bird say? \nLEECH Do not blame the bird. Show us what is on that piece of cloth there. \n[the monkey snarls, seizes the cloth, scampers off with it] \nJACK SPARROW Ohhh! \n[Jack attempts to shoot the monkey with his pistol, his pistol misfires] \n[Jack grabs a pistol from another crewman and blasts the monkey while it's on the deck] \n[the monkey drops the cloth, but is unharmed, and scurries into the rigging] \nGIBBS Know that don't do no good. \nJACK SPARROW It does me. \n[Marty picks up the cloth that the monkey dropped] \nMARTY It's a key! \nJACK SPARROW No! Much more better. It is a *drawing* of a key. \n[Jack holds up the cloth, the crew crowd forward] \n[Among the crew: Chinese man, black man with a black beard, white bearded man with large black hat] \nJACK SPARROW Gentlemen, what do keys do? \nLEECH Keys... unlock... *things*? \nGIBBS And whatever this key unlocks, *inside* there's something valuable. So, we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks! \nJACK SPARROW No! If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it? \nGIBBS So - We're going after this key! \nJACK SPARROW You're not making any sense at all. Any more questions? \nMARTY So... Do we have a heading? \nJACK SPARROW Hah! A heading. Set sail in a... mmm... a general... in *that* way - direction. \nGIBBS Cap'n? \nJACK SPARROW Come on, snap to and make sail, you know how this works. Come on, ?oy/?quick, ?oy/?quick, hey! \n[Marty and Gibbs gather alone by the railing] \nMARTY Have you noticed lately... The captain seems to be actin' a bit strange... -er. \nGIBBS Settin' sail without knowing his own headin'? Somethin's got Jack vexed. Mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow bodes ill for us all. \n[the Black Pearl is shown at night in a thunderstorm] \nPORT ROYAL: EITC HEADQUARTERS \n[a painter is painting a detail on a mural of a world map] \n[a guard brings Will in manacles into Beckett's office] \n[Bootstrap looks up from where he's sitting on a barrel, crabs scuttle across his face] \nJACK SPARROW Is this a dream? \nJACK SPARROW I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum. \n[Bootstrap immediately hands Jack a bottle of rum] \n[Jack pries the bottle from Bootstrap's hand with a crackling sound] \nJACK SPARROW I had some help retrieving the Pearl, by the way. \n[Jack tinks the lip of the bottle with his fingers, then blows across the top of the bottle] \nJACK SPARROW Your son. \n[Jack takes a drink from the bottle] \nJACK SPARROW And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle? \nJACK SPARROW Who? \nJACK SPARROW Ah. So it's you, then.  He shanghaied you into service, eh? \n[a small hermit crab scuttles by Bootstrap, on top of the barrel where Bootstrap sits] \n[Bootstrap grabs the hermit crab, pops it into his mouth, and crunches on it] \n[Jack moves his mouth, jaw, and tongue around in revulsion while watching] \n[Jack hands the bottle back to Bootstrap] \nJACK SPARROW It's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment - \n[Jack starts to walk off, but Bootstrap stands up at the same time and intercepts Jack, blocking him] \nJACK SPARROW Technic - \nJACK SPARROW Yes, but the Flying Dutchman already *has* a captain, so there's re - \nJACK SPARROW Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie? \n[Jack looks at the palm of his left hand, where a black spot boils into view] \n[Jack looks up, but Bootstrap has disappeared] \nBLACK PEARL: ON DECK \n[Jack runs across a wooden deck that has a shallow covering of water] \nJACK SPARROW On deck all hands! Make fast the bunt gasket! On deck! Scurry! ?Scurry-on/?Marty, I want movement! \nJACK SPARROW *I want movement!* \nGIBBS Lift the skin up! \nJACK SPARROW All on deck! Run! And keep running! Run as if the devil himself and itself is upon us! \nGIBBS Do we have a heading? \nJACK SPARROW Ah! Ooh! Run! Land. \n[Jack rises from where he was ducked behind the base of the mast, sees Gibbs again] \nJACK SPARROW Oh! Euh! \nGIBBS Which port? \nJACK SPARROW Didn't say port. I said land. Any land. \n[the monkey in skeleton form swings down, grabs Jack's hat] \nJACK SPARROW Agh! \n[the monkey snarls at Jack, Jack snarls back at the monkey, in imitation] \n[the monkey throws Jack's hat overboard \nELIZABETH SWANN I'll wait for you. \nWILL TURNER Keep a weather eye on the horizon. \n[Will walks back up the prison steps] \nTortuga \nWEATHERED SAILOR *Captain* Jack Sparrow? Owes me four dubloons. Heard he was dead. \nHALF-BLIND FISHERMAN Singapore. That's what I heard. Drunk with a smile on his face. Sure as the tide, Jack Sparrow... will turn up in Singapore. \n[Scarlett is a redhead, Giselle is a blonde, both are standing together, answering Will's questions] \nGISELLE Jack Sparrow! \nSCARLETT I haven't seen 'im in a month. \nGISELLE When you find him, will you give him a message? \n[Giselle slaps Will in the face] \n[a black man who is a shrimper is sitting on a dock, mending his nets] \n[in the background is a bunch of bananas on the dock, and a goat being loaded aboard a ship] \nSHRIMPER Cannot say about Jack Sparrow. But dere's a island, just south of de straits, where I trade spice for... mmm... delicious long pork. Cannot say about Jack. But you find a ship dere. A ship wit' black sails. \nCANNIBAL ISLAND beach \n[Black Pearl seen stranded on a beach, through a spyglass] \nSHRIMPER My brother will take you ashore. \n[the shrimper's brother is rowing Will toward the shore] \n[the rower stops rowing] \nWILL TURNER What's wrong? The beach is right there. \nSHRIMPER'S BROTHER ?: Ne bougeais pas, c'est trop dangereux. \nWILL TURNER What? \nSHRIMPER'S BROTHER ?: Je ne peux, c'est trop dangereux, j'avais le dit. Bon voyage, monsieur. \n[Will jumps off the rowboat, swims ashore, wearing his sword] \n[aerial view, flying over jungle toward beach, showing Will wading ashore] \n[Will walks alongside the Black Pearl, which is tied with ropes to stakes in the sand] \nWILL TURNER Jack! Jack Sparrow! \nWILL TURNER Marty! Cotton! Anybody? \n[Will wanders into the palm jungle bordering the beach] \n[Cotton's parrot flutters up and lands atop a palm stump] \nCOTTON'S PARROT Awk! \nWILL TURNER Ah! A familiar face! \nCOTTON'S PARROT Rawk! Don't eat me! \nWILL TURNER I'm not gonna eat you. \nCOTTON'S PARROT Don't eat me! No! Don't eat me! Akkk! \n[Will finds Gibbs' husk canteen hanging on a plant, trailing a long string] \nWILL TURNER Gibbs. \n[Will follows the string attached to the canteen, over toward a large tree] \n[human eyes open in the background, from a man camouflaged against a nearby tree] \n] Prisoners: Where you goin'...?) \nELIZABETH SWANN Why don't you tell me what's happening? \nELIZABETH SWANN No! Will has gone to find Jack! \nELIZABETH SWANN He's a better man than you give him credit for. \n[a horse and carriage are waiting, the governor opens the door to the carriage for Elizabeth] \nELIZABETH SWANN A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging. \n[the horse and carriage quickly ride off] \n[the horse and carriage arrive at a dock] \n[Captain Hawkins stands silently on the dock facing out to sea] \n[the captain's body soon falls, revealing Mercer, who was standing behind the body, long knife in hand] \nMERCER Evening, Governor.  Shame, huh? He was carryin' this. It's a letter to the King. It's from *you*. \n[horses and soldiers arrive to cut off the governor from fleeing from the dock] \n[the carriage door is opened, but the carriage is empty, Elizabeth is gone] \nMERCER Where is she? \n[Mercer grabs the governor by the lapels, pushes him up against the side of the carriage] \nPORT ROYAL EITC headquarters \n[darkened room] \n[Beckett walks in from the balcony, carrying a lantern] \n[Beckett walks to a table, opens a wooden box, finds the Letters of Marque missing] \nLORD CUTLER BECKETT No doubt you've discovered that loyalty is no longer the currency of the realm, as your father believes. \n[Elizabeth slips into the dark room from an interior door, hands held behind her] \nELIZABETH SWANN Then what is? \nLORD CUTLER BECKETT I'm afraid that *currency* is the currency of the realm. \nELIZABETH SWANN I expect then that we can come to some sort of understanding. I'm here to negotiate. \nLORD CUTLER BECKETT I'm listening. \n[Elizabeth pulls a pistol, points it at Beckett's head] \nLORD CUTLER BECKETT I'm listening *intently*. \nELIZABETH SWANN These Letters of Marque, they are signed by the King? \nLORD CUTLER BECKETT Yes, and they're not valid until they bear my signature and my seal. \nELIZABETH SWANN Or else I would not still be here. You sent Will to get you the Compass owned by Jack Sparrow. It will do you no good. \nLORD CUTLER BECKETT Do explain. \nELIZABETH SWANN I have been to Isla de Muerta, I have seen the treasure myself. There is something you need to know. \nLORD CUTLER BECKETT Ah, I see. *You* think the Compass leads only to the Isla de Muerta, and so you hope to *save* me from an evil fate. But you mustn't worry. I care not for cursed Aztec gold. My desires are not so provincial. There's more than one chest of value in these waters. So perhaps you may wish to enhance your offer. \n[Elizabeth cocks her pistol] \n[Beckett signs the document] \nELIZABETH SWANN Consider into your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night. \nLORD CUTLER BECKETT So I did. A marriage interrupted.  Or fate intervenes. You make great efforts to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom. \nELIZABETH SWANN These aren't going to Jack. \nLORD CUTLER BECKETT Oh really. To ensure Mister Turner's freedom, then? I'll still want that Compass. Consider that in your calculations. \nGIBBS Worse... as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos believe that Jack is a *god* in human form, and they intend to do him the honor of releasing him from his fleshy prison. \n[Cotton bites Gibbs' fingers to illustrate] \nGIBBS ?Argh! They'll roast him and eat him. \nWILL TURNER Where's the rest of the crew? \nGIBBS These cages we're in... weren't built 'til *after* we got here. \n[Will was gripping the bars made of human bones, but quickly pulls his hand away] \nGIBBS The feast is about to begin. Jack's life will end... when the drums stop. \nWILL TURNER Well, we can't just sit here and wait then, can we? \nCANNIBAL ISLAND throne \n[cannibal drums are pounding] \nJACK SPARROW ?No/?Oup! No no! ?Oy!/?Wait! No no! More wood! Big fire! *Big* fire! I am chief! Want big fire! Come on! \nJACK SPARROW ?Oy!/?Boy! Maboogie snickel-snickel. Tout de suite! Come on! More wood! \n[the cannibal standing next to Jack leaves to put more wood on the fire] \n[the cannibals put large pieces of wood on the fire] \n[the cannibals turn around to find that Jack is gone] \nCANNIBAL ISLAND Jack \n[Jack is running across a foot bridge] \n[Jack runs up to a cliff edge, totters at the edge, looking down] \n[Jack examines a length of bamboo pole he finds lying there] \n[Jack goes into a hut, sees various supplies, the sound of buzzing flies is heard] \n[Jack picks up a rope, starts to exit, halts, looks back inside] \n[Jack goes back in, picks up a can of paprika with the EITC logo on the bottom] \n[Jack walks outside the hut, the entire tribe is waiting silently outside, staring at him] \nJACK SPARROW Oh bugger. \n[Jack drops his coil of rope, sprinkles paprika on his armpits] \nJACK SPARROW Little seasoning. Eh? \n[Jack is now tied up to a bamboo pole and hanging face down over a pile of wood] \n[cannibals are dancing wildly] \nJACK SPARROW Well done. \nCANNIBAL ISLAND cages \n[the men begin swinging the cages with increasingly wide arcs] \n[both cages finally come within reach of the cliff, they grab vines and hang on to the cliff] \nGIBBS Put your legs through, start to climb! Agh! \nWILL TURNER Come on men! It'll take all ?of-us/?the-rest to crew the Black Pearl! \nLEECH Actually, you won't need everyone. 'Bout six would do!  Ohhh... dear. \n[Gibbs nods] \nWILL TURNER Hurry! \n[each cage group begins racing against each other up the cliff] \nCome on! Go! Go! Go! \nWILL TURNER Lift the cage! Hurry! \nGIBBS Come on, men! Lift it like a lady's skirt! \n[the men begin running with their legs protruding from the cage, holding up the cage] \n[Marty's short legs make a running motion but are unable to reach the ground] \nCome on! \nCANNIBAL ISLAND hut \n[Jack is running off with the bamboo pole tied to his back] \n[Jack encounters the cannibal boy, standing silently with a fork and a knife, one in each hand] \n[Jack grabs the knife from the boy, and begins cutting his rope off] \n[two cannibal women appear] \n[Jack charges, but the bamboo pole on his back spears a coconut in a pile near the cliff edge] \n[Jack turns suddenly, which flings the coconut off the end of the pole into a cannibal's face] \n[the cannibal slowly lifts the dripping coconut off his face, scowling at Jack] \nCANNIBAL ISLAND cage \n[the cage rolls over a ledge into a small chasm holding a river] \n[cannibals throw spears and shoot arrows at the men in the water, the men swim underwater] \nGIBBS This way, lads! \nCANNIBAL ISLAND Jack \n[the two cannibal women throw numerous fruits at Jack while the pole is still on his back] \n[several of the fruits become impaled along the pole, making Jack look like he's part of a shish-ka-bob] \n?CANNIBAL BOY Da litozo! Da litozo! \n[Jack pole vaults across the chasm, barely lands on the other edge safely] \n[but the fruit slides down to the end of his pole, putting weight on the end over the chasm] \n[Jack falls into the chasm, screaming] \n[Jack's pole catches between the two walls of a chasm] \n[two native women watch Jack fall into the chasm, with disinterest] \nCANNIBAL WOMAN ?A-geev-nee. Uh-boogie? \n[the two cannibal women walk off, disinterested] \nJACK SPARROW Bugger. \n[Jack's pole slips loose, he falls into the chasm, screaming] \n[As Jack falls through the first rope bridge, the rope comes undone but is still attached to the bamboo pole and to Jack] \n[Jack is hung upside-down in the chasm when the bamboo pole catches] \n[Jack falls through a total of six rope bridges] \n[Jack lands on his back on grass] \n[bamboo pole comes down at him, spears the ground near his head] \n[fruits tumble down afterwards] \nCANNIBAL ISLAND beach \n[only Ragetti and Cotton's parrot are aboard the Black Pearl, Pintel is on the beach below] \nPINTEL ?Pull-loose/?Unloose the mooring lines! The mooring lines! \nWILL TURNER She *is* locked up, in a prison, bound to hang for helping *you*! \nJACK SPARROW There comes a time when one must take responsibility for one's mistakes. \n[Will pulls a sword from the waistband of a pirate who is turned around, points it at Jack] \nWILL TURNER I need that Compass of yours, Jack. I must trade it for her freedom. \n[Jack pushes Will's sword aside] \nJACK SPARROW Mister Gibbs! \nGIBBS Cap'n. \nJACK SPARROW We have a need to travel upriver. \nGIBBS By need, d'you mean a... trifling need, ?uh/?a... fleeting, as in say in a passing fancy? \nJACK SPARROW No, a... resolute and unyielding need. \nWILL TURNER What we need to do is make sail for Port Royal with all haste. \nJACK SPARROW William... I shall trade you the Compass, if you will help me... to find *this*. \nWILL TURNER You want me to find this? \nJACK SPARROW No. *You* want you to find this. Because the finding this finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating and your discovering the detecting of a way to save your ?dolly/?dotty belle ol'... what's-her-face. Savvy? \nWILL TURNER This... is going to save Elizabeth? \nJACK SPARROW How much do you know about Davy Jones? \nWILL TURNER Not much. \nJACK SPARROW Yeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth. \nEdinburgh Trader \n[a crewman swabbing the deck happens to notice a white dress tucked in a corner, pulls it out] \n[the crewmen are arguing loudly about the newfound dress] \nBELLAMY What's all this? If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have to share, and wear it one after the other. \nBURSAR It's not like that, Sir. This ship is haunted. \nBELLAMY Is it now? 'N' you? \nQUARTERMASTER The... female presence... amongst us, yes... all the men... they can feel it. \nThe ghost of a lady, widowed before her marriage, I figure it. Searching for her husband, lost at sea. \nA virgin, too, likely as not. \nAnd that bodes ill by all accounts. \nBURSAR I say... that we throw the dress overboard, and we hope the spirit finds it. \nQUARTERMASTER No! That - that will just anger the spirit, Sir. What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs, and then just get it back! \nBELLAMY Enough! Enough! You're a pair of superstitious goats and it's got the best of you. Now this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway aboard. A young woman, by the look of it. I want you to search the ship and find 'er. Oh, and uh... she's probably naked. \n[the crew enthusiastically rushes off in search of the stowaway] \nPantano River \n[aerial view of the mouth of the Pantano River, two longboats are beginning their way up the river] \n[the longboats are in a swampy area with twisted roots] \nWILL TURNER Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean? \nGIBBS Well, if you believe such things, there's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones. A fearsome creature with giant tentacles that suction your face clean off. And drag an entire ship past the crushing darkness. The Kraken! \n[Marty turns around at mention of the word, Pintel and Ragetti look at each other] \nGIBBS They say the stench of its breath is like - ooh! Imagine: The last thing you know on God's green earth is the roar of the Kraken, and the reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses. If you believe such things. \nTIA DALMA The payment is fair. \nJACK SPARROW We're looking for this.  And what it goes to. \nTIA DALMA The Compass you bartered from me. It cannot lead you to dis? \nJACK SPARROW Maybe. Why? \nTIA DALMA Ayeee... Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants! Or... do know, but are loathe to claim it as your own. Your key go to a chest, and it is what lay inside the chest you seek, don't it? \nGIBBS What *is* inside? \nPINTEL Gold! Jewels? Unclaimed properties of a valuable nature? \nRAGETTI Nothing... bad, I hope. \n[a jar of eyeballs is hanging next to Ragetti's face as he speaks] \nTIA DALMA You know of... Davy Jones, yes? A man of de sea. A great sailor, until he ran afoul of dat which vex all men. \nWILL TURNER What vexes all men? \nTIA DALMA What, indeed. \nGIBBS The sea? \nPINTEL Sums! \nRAGETTI Dichotomy of good and evil. \nJACK SPARROW A *woman*. \nTIA DALMA A wo-*man*. He fell in love. \nGIBBS No-no-no-no, I heard it was the *sea* he fell in love with. \nTIA DALMA Same story, different versions, and all are true. See, it was a *woman*, as changing, and harsh, and untamable as the sea. Him never stopped loving her. But the pain it cause 'im was too much to live wid. But not enough to cause him to die. \nWILL TURNER What... exactly did he put into the chest? \nTIA DALMA Him heart. \nRAGETTI Literally, or figuratively? \nPINTEL He couldn't li'erally put his heart in a chest!  Could he? \nTIA DALMA It was not wort' feeling what... small fleeting joy life brings, and so... he carved out him heart, lock it away in a chest, and hide de chest from de world. De keys, he keep wid him at all times. \nWILL TURNER You knew this. \nJACK SPARROW I did not. I didn't know where the key was. But now we do. So all that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, hey! \nTIA DALMA Let me see your hand. \n[Jack shows his right hand is untouched, but Tia unwraps the bandage on his left hand] \n[the black spot on Jack's left hand is revealed] \nGIBBS Uhhh! The black spot! \n[Gibbs quickly wipes his hands on his chest, spins around once to the left, and spits] \nBlack spot! \nBlack spot! \n[Pintel and Ragetti copy Gibbs' ritual, in synchrony] \nJACK SPARROW My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know. \n[pushing aside cloth door beads, Tia goes into a back room, and searches for something] \nTIA DALMA I am justMy little ###, where are you? ### \n[Jack steals a ring off of one of Tia's tables, beside the ring is a silver locket] \n[Tia comes back with an object from the back room] \nEdinburgh Trader \n[inside a cabin aboard the Edinburgh Trader, Captain Bellamy is throwing documents down on the table] \nBELLAMY It's an outrage. Port tariffs, berthing fees, *wharf* handling, and heaven help us, pilotage. Are we all to work for the East India Trading Company, then? \nQUARTERMASTER I'm afraid, Sir... Tortuga is the only free port left in these waters. \nBELLAMY A *pirate* port is what you mean. Well, I'm sorry. An honest sailor is what I am. I make my living fair, and I sleep well each night, thank you. \n[a white dress floats by the cabin window, outside] \nBURSAR S-S-Sir! \n[they all rush to the window of the cabin and look out] \n[they all see the dress float by the cabin window, on its second pass] \n[one crewman gasps] \n[the men go outside to see the dress that was floating by the window] \n[the dress floats like a ghost, its left arm raised as if pointing] \nBURSAR She wants you to... do something. \nBELLAMY She's tryna give a sign. \n[the dress sweeps over a lantern, knocking it over and part of the deck ignites] \nBELLAMY Over there! Look for a sign! \n[the crew rush to the railing and look out at the sea] \n[Elizabeth, up on the mast overhead, sighs in exasperation] \nQUARTERMASTER Look there! There it is. There's the sign. \n?BURSAR That's seaweed. \nQUARTERMASTER S-Seaweed can be a sign. \n?BURSAR Looks like entrails. \n?That ?would be a bad sign. \nELIZABETH SWANN What's that over there? \n[Elizabeth is now sitting on a platform on the deck behind the men, pointing at the deck where the lantern fell] \n[the men at the railing turn around and look where Elizabeth is pointing] \n[the fire burning on the desk spells out \"Tortuga\" in fiery letters] \nTortuga \n[men are tied up with ropes alongside a well, camera pans past the well] \n[a man is tied up and being dunked in the well, and is spouting water from his mouth] \n[crowded tavern, glass bottles are being shot off of people's heads for entertainment] \n[a duo of musicians is playing a guitar and accordion] \nGIBBS And what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl? \nELDERLY MAN Truth be told, I never sailed a day in me life. I figure I should get out and see the world while I'm still young. \nGIBBS You'll do. Make your mark. Next! \nJILTED MAN My wife ran off with my dog. And I'm drunk for a month. And I don't give a ass rat's if I live or die. \nGIBBS Perfect! Next! \nONE-ARMED MAN Me have one arm, 'n' a bum leg. \nGIBBS It's the crow's nest for you. \nHeave! \n[the two men throw the carried man off the balcony, then Jack continues on his way] \n[the music stops, Norrington threateningly holds a bottle in his left hand] \nNORRINGTON Come on, men! Who wants some? Form an orderly line, I'll have you all one by one. Come on, who's first? \n[from behind, Elizabeth grabs the bottle from Norrington, smashes it over his head, knocking him out] \nELIZABETH SWANN I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself! \n[the crowd cheers, and everyone holds up their mugs in a toast] \n[men throw Norrington into the mud with some pigs, the crowd leaves except for Elizabeth] \n[Elizabeth turns Norrington over, onto his back] \nELIZABETH SWANN James Norrington.  What has the world done to you? \n[Mercer observes Elizabeth and Norrington from the doorway of the tavern] \nFlying Dutchman \n[Jones plays his pipe organ with his tentacles, steam coming from pipes] \n[the crew are on desk, slaving away, pulling rhythmically on a rope] \nHeave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! \nBO'SUN Secure the mast tackle, Mister Turner! \nBO'SUN Step ?to-it/?tight! \n[Will goes to grab a rope] \nWILL TURNER Step aside! \nBO'SUN ?Regain-?yourselves!/?Mind-?yourself! \n[Bootstrap sees that the other man at the rope is his son, Bootstrap is stunned] \n[Bootstrap lets go of the rope, Will attempts to grab the sliding rope] \n[the cannon's rope drags Will across the deck] \n[the hoisted cannon crashes to the deck, and the organ music stops] \nBO'SUN Haul that weevil to his feet! \n[the crew haul Will to his feet] \nBO'SUN Five lashes to remind you... to stay on 'em! \nBO'SUN Impeding me in my duties. You'll share the punishment. \nDAVY JONES Will you now? And what would prompt such an act of charity? \nDAVY JONES Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha! What fortuitous circumstance be this! Five lashes be owed. I believe it is. \n[Jones hands the whip to Bootstrap, Jones' tentacle curls around the shaft of it] \nDAVY JONES The cat's out of the bag, Mister Turner. Your issue will feel its sting be it the Bo'sun's hand, by your own. \nDAVY JONES Bo'sun! \n[Bootstrap reluctantly takes the whip] \n[two crewmen tear Will's shirt off, exposing his bare back] \n[Bootstrap whips Will's back five times] \n[Will is tossed into a lower part of the deck, partially filled with water] \n[Will stands up, wearing an intact white shirt] \nBO'SUN You had it easy, boy! Ha ha ha! \nELIZABETH SWANN Jack. All I want is to find Will. \nJACK SPARROW Are you certain?

So, we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks! \nJACK SPARROW No! If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it? \nGIBBS So - We're going after this key! \nJACK SPARROW You're not making any sense at all. Any more questions? \nMARTY So... Do we have a heading? \nJACK SPARROW Hah! A heading.

CUT TO: 
18   INT. OLD LION SOCIAL CLUB - NIGHT                                  18 
Vitti's men converse quietly while a soldier sweeps the room for bugs. He gives the "all clear" and SALVATORE MASIELLO, the old consigliere, speaks. 
MASIELLO The Manetta family is asking a lot of questions. They think we hit Dominic. 
CARLO MANGANO, the burly underboss of the Vitti family, jumps in. 
(CONTINUED) 
18   CONTINUED:                                                       18 
MANGANO Forget Dominic! They were after Paul. (to Vitti) It's a miracle you survived. I thank God. 
VITTI Yeah, thank God. All I know is if I didn't have some veal stuck in my teeth, I'd be laying there with Dominic. 
JOHNNY BIGS This is all about the big meeting. Primo Sindone wants to run the whole show. 
MANGANO Yeah, but Primo's a boss. He knows the rules. He couldn't go after Dominic and Paul unless the other families gave their permission. 
VITTI (starting to sweat) If they did, we're heading for one big fuckin' war. (having trouble breathing) Talk to Zello and Baldassare. Find out what you can. We got two weeks. If the other New York bosses are against us, I want to know it before I walk into that meeting. 
He feels a stabbing pain in his chest. 
MANGANO You all right, Paul? You don't look good. 
VITTI I'm a little choked up here.   I gotta get some air. 
He walks outside. Jelly follows.     Mangano looks quizzically after them.

19   EXT. OUTSIDE THE OLD LION - CONTINUOUS ACTION                   19 
Vitti is having trouble breathing. 
JELLY You feel all right? 
VITTI I feel like shit. This whole thing is like a huge fuckin' headache. 
JELLY (concerned) You havin' one of those mindgrains? 
Sweating profusely now, Vitti feels another stabbing chest pain. 
VITTI Get the car. 
CUT TO: 
20   INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - LATER                                     20 
Vitti is putting on his shirt. He looks considerably better. Jelly is sitting down, tapping his own knee with the little rubber hammer. Nothing moves. 
DOCTOR SHULMAN, a young cardiology resident, enters. 
DOCTOR Good news, Mr. Evans.   Your heart is just fine. 
VITTI How could it be fine? I've had like eight heart attacks in the last three weeks. 
DOCTOR Well, based on everything, I'd say you probably had an anxiety attack. 
VITTI (a beat) What? 
DOCTOR An anxiety attack. A panic attack. I can give you some Xanax if it happens again soon -- 
(CONTINUED) 
20   CONTINUED:                                                       20 
VITTI (menacing) Look at me. Do I look like a guy who panics? 
DOCTOR (nervous now) There's nothing -- I mean -- it's a common thing -- 
VITTI Where did you go to medical school? I had a heart attack, you quack bastard. 
DOCTOR (very scared now) Well, not according to these -- 
As Vitti moves toward the Doctor, Jelly instinctively grabs the Doctor from behind and holds him while Vitti wraps the blood pressure cuff around his neck. 
VITTI (low and deadly, pumping up the cuff with the squeeze-ball) Listen to me, jerk-off. I had a mild heart attack and now it's over. You understand? 
The Doctor nods vigorously, his eyes bugging out as the pressure around his neck increases. 
VITTI If anyone asks you, you never saw me, and I was never here. Is that clear? 
DOCTOR (strangled) Yes. 
VITTI Good. (to Jelly) Take the chart. 
Jelly releases the Doctor, grabs all the papers and follows Vitti out the door. 
CUT TO: 
21   EXT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER                                 21 
Vitti and Jelly come walking out the emergency room exit. Vitti stops. 
VITTI Jelly, I need you to do something for me as my friend.

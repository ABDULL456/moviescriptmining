{"train": "BRICK \nWritten by \nRian Johnson \nSUPER MAIN TITLES \nOver a grimy concrete wall creeping by. We emerge from... \nEXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL - EARLY MORNING \nA gaping hole in the concrete side of a freeway. On the embankment beside the hole BRENDAN FRYE squats, shoulders hunched. His dark eyes behind thin glasses watch the shallow stream of water which flows into the tunnel. \nTHE WATER \nnot more than six inches deep. Just beneath the surface a young woman's pale blue arm in gaudy bracelets bats against the edge of her body like a docked boat. A pebble plinks into the water beside it.1 \nTITLE CARD OVER BLACK:         \"2 DAYS PREVIOUS\" INT. LOCKER CAGE - DAY \nA single locker. That same arm, bracelets and all, slips a note through the slats, then leaves quickly. \nAs the cage empties a lone figure slumps to the locker. Opens it. The note falls to his feet. \nThe figure is Brendan. He unfolds the note (folded in a triangle) -- \"12:30 PICO & ALEXANDER\". \nA STREET SIGN \nPico and Alexander.2 \nA WRIST WATCH 12:43.   Brendan looks up from the watch. \nEXT. STREET CORNER - DAY \nHe sits on the curb of a wide suburban street, eats lunch from a brown bag and watches a phone booth on the corner. He shows no surprise when it begins to ring. Brendan goes to the phone and puts the receiver to his ear. Silence for a moment, then a thin female voice from the phone. \nOriginally Dode was later revealed to have been hiding above the tunnel. The street names were changed in production to match existing streets (we couldn't afford to create custom street signs.) \nVOICE (over phone) Brendan? \nBRENDAN Emily? \nEMILY (weakly) Yeah. How's things? \nBRENDAN (slow, deliberate) Status quo. \nEMILY Yeah? \nBRENDAN Uh huh. \nEMILY That's good. \nHer voice thins to a high, strained breath. She is crying. \nBRENDAN What's going on, Em? \nEMILY (through strained crying) It's good to see you, Brendan. \nBrendan's eyes glance around the surrounding street. Emily is crying again. \nEMILY (CONT'D) (cont'd) It's been some time. \nBRENDAN Two months. \nEMILY Yeah. I didn't even know your locker. I had to ask Brain. \nMore crying noises. \nBRENDAN Em, why don't we meet somewhere? \nEMILY I can't. \nBRENDAN Why not? \nEMILY I screwed up real bad. I really screwed up. \nBRENDAN Screwed up how? \nTHE BRAIN Know him? \nBRENDAN By sight. \nTHE BRAIN I won't argue then. Anyway Em tagged after them for a bit, but it didn't work. So she picked her way down the food chain. Last I seen she was with whasshername, that drama vamp. Small time dealer, augh, the evil one, the one you dated- \nBRENDAN Kara. \nTHE BRAIN That's my bus. \nBRENDAN You know her locker number? \nTHE BRAIN Kara's? \nBRENDAN Em's. \nTHE BRAIN \nBRENDAN Thanks Brain. Keep your specs on, find me if she shows. \nTHE BRAIN Sure. \nThe Brain trots off. In the distance Brad and Laura laugh, and he kisses her. Her hair blows in the wind. \nEXT. LOCKER CAGE - DAY \nEmpty. Locker 239 is open, its door swinging gently in the wind. \nEXT. BACK OF GYM - DAY \nBrendan sits against the massive building, flipping through loose papers. He finds two photographs, one of Emily hugging him, the other of Emily with a beautiful sharp-eyed girl at a party, drinks in hand. \nSorting more papers, he finds a red card with a sequined mask on the front. The bottom edge has been torn off. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - DAY Sixth period has broke. Masses of students pile into busses. \nEXT. SCHOOL THEATER - DAY \nA huge chunk of brown building. Brendan strides towards it. \nINT. SCHOOL THEATER - CONTINUOUS \nDrama people sit on the floor facing the stage. Brendan steps behind one, the sharp-eyed girl from the picture. She holds a freshman boy's head in her lap. Pets it like a dog. \nShe looks back at Brendan, her face in shadow. \nGIRL (through a mocking smile) Hello, Brendan. \nBRENDAN Kara. \nKARA Come to see the show? Kisses the freshman's forehead, purring. \nBRENDAN No, I didn't. (nudges the freshman with his toe) Lapdog, blow. \nThe freshman sits up, looks to Kara like a spooked puppy. \nKARA (to the lapdog) Stay. (to Brendan) Don't be mean. \nBRENDAN I'm all friendly. (to the lapdog) Watch your head, kid - that thing bites. \nThe dog pops up again. Kara pulls him down and nuzzles his ear. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) (cont'd) I need words. KARA I'm listening. \nBRENDAN About Emily Kostich. \nShe stops nuzzling a little too quickly. \nKARA (to the dog) Get me my purse. (he goes) Hurry! \nHe breaks into a trot. Kara smiles at Brendan. \nBRENDAN Still picking your teeth with freshmen? \nKARA You were a freshman once. \nShe slides her fingers up his arm. He growls and pushes them away. \nLAURA'S VOICE I know everyone and I've got all the time in the world. \nBRENDAN Folly of youth. Ask whose invitation I've got. \nLAURA'S VOICE (slightly) What you said. \nBRENDAN Emily Kostich. \nA beat. \nLAURA'S VOICE 15 Bush street, up in Stockton Cove. Buzz 42 at the gate. Nine o'clock. But who- \nBrendan hangs up. He folds his hands under his chin and stares at the phone, perfectly still. The clock on his desk says 4:53. DISSOLVE TO: \nBrendan at his desk, tapping away at Tetris. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nThe desk is empty, Tetris paused. A shower runs behind an ajar door in the background. \nEXT. STOCKTON COVE GATE - NIGHT \nAn imposing private community gate. Brendan coasts up on his bike and ditches it in the bushes. He checks the call box directory: \"42 -- DANNON\" \nUsing the call box as a hand hold he hops the gate and walks briskly up the street. \nEXT. STOCKTON COVE STREET - NIGHT \nShiny cars line the curb. Party noises come from an upscale two story house. Brendan takes a short breath, then strides up to the front door. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nLarge and clean, with a two story ceiling and a railed staircase at one end. Fifteen or twenty clean people, some in costumes, mill about in cliques. Brendan comes in as if he doesn't mind who sees him coming in. He gets a couple odd stares, but no one stops him. \nWith non obtrusive confidence he cuts through the crowd to the beer keg in back and draws half a cup. \nINT. PARLOUR - SAME \nRichly adorned, crowded, lit with bright pools of light. Brendan drifts in and stands in the back, deep in shadow. \nThe music comes from a baby grand piano set against one wall. Laura Dannon leans against it. She wears a red kimono, and is striking against the velvet black piano. Laura's kid sister, 11 years old with glasses, sits at the piano playing \"All I do is Dream of You\". \nLaura sings, lovely and soft but with strength.1 \nBrendan watches from the back, his face obscured in shadow, but his eyes gleam. Through the darkened window behind him a match flares up, and someone standing outside lights a cigarette. \nLaura finishes the song. The room applauds, and she ruffles her kid sister's hair. \nBrendan ducks out, and into \nBy the time we got around to production this had changed to \"Someone to Watch Over Me,\" but the publishing rights proved too expensive (i.e. not free.) We chose the Gilbert & Sullivan song, which besides being lovely was also in the public domain (i.e. free.) \nINT. LIVING ROOM - SAME \nBrad Bramish, the jock who was kissing Laura in the parking lot, sits slouched on the couch in a dense crowd. He holds a cup and speaks much too loudly to a guy named Biff at his elbow. \nBRAD If the coach wants to play me I'll play, but I can't put my best game in if I've got to worry about whether I'm going to be in there. Halftime last game, coach is pissed I ran it on a pass play, out on the field he says to me 'you gotta think about the team and you gotta' you know and 'if you run that ball again you're out', and I said to him you gotta let me play! I'm out there, let me play, and he's saying 'no you're out' and I kept saying 'Let me play! Let me play! Let me play!', just right in his face- \nBIFF He was! \nBRAD Just 'Let me play! Let me play! Let me play!' 'No you gotta' 'No, let me play! Let me play! Let me play!' \nBrad hunches forward, his face swollen purple, yelling that over and over. Tom steps in front of Brendan, blocking his line of sight. \nBrendan scans the rest of the room. His eyes catch on Laura, leaning against a divan. Her bright, sharp eyes cut through the room, straight into Brendan. He wags his eyebrows at her. \nShe looks away quickly. Brendan turns back to Brad, still shouting 'let me play'. Tom stands between them. \nBRENDAN Tom! \nBrad falls silent. Most of the room follows suit. Tom turns around. Brendan smiles good naturedly. \nBRENDAN (cont'd) Could you step aside, please? I'm trying to follow Brad's story, and it's difficult when I can't see his face. \nThe room watches Brendan. Tom mumbles something and steps aside. Brad stares at Brendan stupidly. Brendan flashes a dopey grin and tips his glass. \nBRAD (stumbles) He doesn't give me a play to make, what can I do, you know? \nBRENDAN I saw her yesterday. \nLAURA Nearly nobody's seen her. So what did she tell you? \nBRENDAN (winces) Score 0 for finesse. \nLAURA Listen, you're scratching at the wrong door. I wasn't with Emily enough to know details of what she was in, I just got wind of the downfall, and I didn't get any details of that, except that it was bad. So now that we're showing some cards... \nBRENDAN If you haven't got a finger in Em's troubles, why'd her name get me into your rather exclusive party? \nLAURA Keep up with me now. I don't know, but it sounded like you did, and a body's got a right to be curious. Now I'm not so sure. \nBRENDAN Well I'll put that body to bed. I don't know a damn thing about whatever troubles, and that works for me. I just want to find her. \nA long beat. Laura studies Brendan's face, then seems to come to a decision. \nLAURA Coffee and pie. \nThe words hang in the air a moment. A look of recognition from Brendan. \nBRENDAN Coffee and pie oh my? \nLAURA And you didn't hear it from me. \nHe sips his drink. A voice calls from the glass door. Another girl. Laura flashes Brendan a look and goes to her. They have quick, quiet words and the girl leaves. Laura turns back to Brendan. \nLAURA (CONT'D) (cont'd) Will you wait here for me? \nBRENDAN Sure. \nLAURA You'll stay right here and wait -- I'll be five minutes. \nBRENDAN Yes. \nThe moment she leaves Brendan runs across the lawn and hops the fence, into the neighbor's yard. \nEXT. SIDE OF HOUSE \nBrendan runs to the edge of the neighboring house and peeks around. Laura comes out the front door, cuts across the lawn and sidewalk and trots out into the street. Brendan \nbegins to follow, but a noise from behind the fence stops him - a match being struck. \nBrendan creeps towards the fence and peers through a splintered hole. \nBRENDAN'S POV - THROUGH THE FENCE \nA brightly lit window in the side of Brad's house, and through the window the party. \nA dark figure wearing a long coat and broad rimmed hat, all inky black. The figure smokes a cigarette and watches the party, absently stroking his cheek. \nBrendan steps back - SNAP!   A twig. \nThe figure freezes. Then, making no noise at all, it spins to face Brendan, a towering black form against the window. \nThe glowing cigarette falls to the grass. A metallic glint, and a clicking sound not unlike a gun. \nBrendan throws himself backwards onto the grass. A beat. \nThrough the hole the black of the figure's cloak whips away. \nBrendan hesitates, then hops the fence. \nEXT. SIDE OF BRAD'S HOUSE - SAME \nBrendan lands on his feet. No black figure to be found. \nThe cigarette still smolders on the ground. Hand rolled, plain paper. \nBrendan gazes through the window, catching his breath. Then he breaks the trance and creeps towards the street. \nEXT. FRONT LAWN - NIGHT \nPeeking around the house, Brendan sees Laura cut across the lawn and trot into the street. Using parked cars as cover, Brendan follows. \nEXT. STREET \nBetween cars, Brendan sees a lanky kid in baggy jeans and engineer boots with a clean shaven head leaning against a black Mustang. Laura goes to him and speaks quickly. \nSTONER 1 (O.S.) Put him down, man! \nDODE Deal with whatever this ain't about and drop it. \nBIG STONER (to Brendan) Nothing more here, bra. \nBRENDAN Tell Emily I want to see her. Tell her if she still wants my help or not that's her business, but I want to hear it straight from her. \nDODE She don't - \nBrendan walks away. \nBRENDAN Today. She knows where I eat lunch. \nWhen Brendan is a safe distance away the biggest stoner shouts with conviction \nBIG STONER And stay out, punk! \nEXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS \nBrendan hides behind a tall clump of bushes. \nA moment later Dode hustles away from Carrows. Brendan follows. \nEXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING \nThe sun is rising as Brendan tails Dode through the twisty suburban streets. \nBrendan takes cover as Dode stops by a white hatchback. \nA girl gets out of the car and embraces Dode. Her wrist is adorned with the same cheap plastic bracelets as the dead girl's arm. Dode speaks quickly to her, she nods and speaks back. He hands her a slip of paper, which she tucks into a brightly colored address book and slips in her jacket pocket. They embrace again, Dode walks off and the girl gets in her car. \nBrendan stumbles after the car, but it is quickly gone. He watches it go, then follows Dode back towards school. \nEXT. SCHOOL THEATER - MORNING \nDode slumps into the front door of the brown building. Brendan watches him from a distance, eyes thoughtful. After a beat he turns and walks off into the thickening crowds of students. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE UP \nEXT. BACK OF SCHOOL - MIDDAY \nBrendan eats lunch alone on a concrete wall beside a long, empty utility road behind the school. \nLATER \nReclining on the wall, reading \"Lord of the Flies\". He raises his eyes, and sits up suddenly. \nOff in the distance on the utility road a tiny figure approaches, stumbling. Brendan jumps and hits the ground running towards the figure. \nMeet the girl with cheap bracelets, the girl Dode spoke to, the dead girl, Emily. He catches her just as she stumbles and falls and carries her into the shade of a covered hallway. \nEXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nEmily and Brendan sit in silence. She is very pretty, but she looks bad. Too much makeup, not enough sleep. She sniffles, speaks to her shoes. \nEMILY I must have sounded pretty crazy on the phone. Yesterday. \nShe taps her shoes together lightly, eyes fixed on them. \nEMILY (cont'd) It was dumb, I got paranoid over a really stupid thing. I was high, I went crazy for a little bit, but now you have to forget about it. Please. That's how you can help me now, forget about it. \nShe turns her weak eyes to Brendan for the first time.     His stare is unwavering, searching. She pushes on. \nEMILY (cont'd) Brendan, I know you're mad at all these people, cause you think I went away from you and went to them. But you've got to start seeing it as my decision, stop being angry because where I want to be at's different from where you wanna be at. \nBRENDAN (angry) Who fed you that line, Em? \nShe looks back at her shoes. \nEMILY And stop picking on Dode. He's a good guy. \nBRENDAN The Carrows rat? \nEMILY He's a good friend. \nSparsely furnished. Brendan plays Tetris on his computer, staring off into space. His mom's voice calls \"Good night\" and the hallway light turns off. \nLATER \n10:30 by the clock radio on Brendan's nightstand. The slip of paper rests beside it. Brendan lies in bed, staring at the symbol on the paper. His eyes tense. \nTHE SYMBOL \nGrowing larger, burning with a searing intensity, then folding into darkness. Water rushes overhead, over concrete, concrete with a hole in it -- the runoff tunnel, just for an instant, then back underwater, screaming. Brendan choking, screaming, plunging upwards. A woman with no face falls from the darkness and kisses him, her long hair sweeping around him then pulling away. As the last strands slide off his face he wakes up with a start. \nThe clock says 3:46. Brendan drips with sweat, breathing raggedly. He takes the paper and a pencil from the nightstand and shades the symbol to look like this: \nFLASH CUT - The runoff tunnel, lining up perfectly with the now shaded symbol. \nBACK TO BRENDAN \nHis eyes turn uneasy as he removes his glasses and clicks off the light. \nEXT. BRENDAN'S HOUSE - DAWN \nBrendan walks off into the hazy pre-dawn light. \nEXT. EDGE OF RAVINE \nBrendan stops at a high wall of weeds, listening to the low gurgle of moving water. Slowly, robotically he pushes through. \nEMILY'S BODY \nFace down, bobbing gently in shallow water. Bluish white. Red foam clings to her. \nEXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL \nSilently, as if lowered by a string Brendan sinks down, squatting in the mud. His lungs empty in one choppy breath. He pulls his glasses off sluggishly. \nEMILY'S ARM \nLifeless, pale. \nBRENDAN'S FACE \nA contorted, frozen mask, eyes wet. \nEMILY'S HAIR \nStringy, flowing gently in the water. \nBRENDAN'S EYES \nDazed, drifting... then suddenly snapping to attention. \nA noise. From the tunnel. \nBrendan freezes. The inky blackness of the tunnel mouth opens like a vacuum... silent, but then - \nThe scrape of a shoe against concrete, then echoing footsteps running away. \nBrendan springs like a cat, sprinting into the tunnel. \nINT. TUNNEL \nNearly pitch black. 2 sets of running footfalls. Brendan is chasing, running full speed into the blackness, heart pounding - we almost don't notice that Brendan's are now the only footfalls. \nBrendan notices. He stops. Silence in the darkness, except for Brendan's breath... and someone near... \nSLAM! Brendan takes a fist in the cheek and goes down. An inky black figure steps from the shadows and kicks him in the stomach. Brendan curls on the ground, the figure over him. \nFIGURE (low whisper) Your little Em. \nThe figure runs off. Brendan raises his head painfully - the figure is silhouetted briefly against the distant bright end of the tunnel, then is gone. \nEXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL - EARLY MORNING \nEmily's body is still there. Brendan crawls out of the tunnel and collapses in the shallow water, beside the body. He rests his head on his arm, eyes on Em's hair. \nEXT. CAMPUS - EARLY MORNING \nCold and barren, nearly empty. Brendan limps across the barren lawns. \nBRENDAN Tell the Pin that Brad was my calling card, and I need words. \nKARA Brad Bramish? Through the door and into the theater. \nINT. BACKSTAGE OF THEATER - CONTINUOUS \nHe spins to see Kara's face just before the door closes. She's worried. \nEXT. CROWDED SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY \nThe Brain walks out of a classroom and Brendan swings behind him. \nBRENDAN (fast and low) Tail Kara through lunch. She's got rehearsal but she'll blow early. She goes home, drop her, else wait for my call. \nThe Brain turns and Brendan's gone. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - LUNCH Brendan wanders through the thick lunchtime crowd towards a cluster of 3 or 4 flashy luxury cars set aside at the far end of the lot. \nBrad Bramish sits slouched in the front seat of his convertible, front door open. A small crowd hangs about Brad, his crony Biff at his elbow. \nBRAD That's all I'm saying, is put me in the game and I'll do what needs to be done, but they don't put me in, what needs doing don't get done and don't come crying to me, man. Get off my grill man, you didn't put me in, don't come to me if you didn't let me play. \nBIFF They didn't! \nBrendan scans the rest of the cars. His eyes catch on Laura Dannon sitting in another convertible, off to the side. Her bright eyes cut through the crowd, straight into Brendan. \nHe wags his eyebrows at her. She looks away. Brendan walks into Brad's direct line of view and obviously leans against one of the cars. \nBRAD Hey! What are you doing here? \nBRENDAN Listening. \nBRAD Uh huh. \nBRENDAN Alright, you got me. I'm a scout for the Gophers. \nBRAD (not amused) Oh yeah? \nBRENDAN Of all things, yeah. Been watching your game for a month, but that story just now clenched it. You've got heart, kid. How soon can you move to Minneapolis? \nA few snickers around the crowd, but nowhere near Brad. \nBRAD (flat with anger) Yeah? \nBRENDAN Cold winters, but they've got a great public transit system. \nBRAD Yeah? \nBRENDAN Yeah. \nBRAD Oh yeah? \nBRENDAN There's a thesaurus in the library. 'Yeah's under 'Y'. Go ahead, I'll wait. \nBRAD Who invited you? \nBRENDAN To the parking lot? Well gee I kind of invited myself. \nBRAD I think you'd better leave then. \nBRENDAN No, I'm having too good a time. \nBRAD Just the same. \nBrendan smiles slightly, and very deliberately crosses his legs. Brad's face tenses. \nBRAD (cont'd) Maybe you want to go someplace more private. \nBRENDAN With you? \nBrad says 'who else?' by lifting his arms. \nBRENDAN (cont'd) (as if he's been asked to the movies) Sure. \nBrendan stands and walks off. Brad follows and the rest of the crowd trails after him. \nHe leads them behind a parked VW van and turns to face Brad. People gather around in a wide circle. \nTHE BRAIN (on the phone) You didn't call. \nBRENDAN Sorry. Kara went home though, didn't she? THE BRAIN Yeah, but she stopped at a payphone and made two calls that she didn't want on her phone bill. \nBRENDAN Get the numbers? \nTHE BRAIN No. Sorry. \nBRENDAN S'alright. Are me and Brad front page news? \nTHE BRAIN All the buzz. You really do that? \nBRENDAN Yeah. \nTHE BRAIN Why? Is Brad the Pin? \nBRENDAN Brad's a sap. I downed him on his field and his crew didn't bite. So now I know he's a sap and anyone who acts like he isn't is profiting by it. That's not why I roughed him, though. \nBRAIN For kicks? \nBRENDAN Economics. Brad's the school's biggest jake buyer, so if this Pin is behind all the selling, I just got his attention. Anyway, now's just shaking things out. Look, you know a kid around the burgh, lanky, short, shaved head, turns a black tang? \nTHE BRAIN I told you before I don't know the car. Those types are a nickel a pound, but nobody I know that you don't. And Trueman again- \nBRENDAN Keep him off. And keep your specs on - I need to find that kid. \nTHE BRAIN Okay. \nBrendan hangs up and turns sluggishly. \nA lanky kid with a short shaved head and engineer boots punches him in the face. \nBrendan hits the pavement. The lanky kid is over him in a split second, beating his face and body with short, heavy blows. \nFlashes of the lanky kid - a shiny scar shaped like a thin triangle runs down the side of his face. \nAfter a brief silent thrashing the kid walks off with several other blurry figures. A car peels out and roars off O.S. \nBrendan lies still. The class bell rings, very distant. Legs criss cross before his eyes, each blurring the world a bit more until it is completely smeared. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nINT. OFFICE Brendan sits with an ice pack against his head in a tiny office. A man in his early thirties behind a wood colored \ndesk and name plate, \"GARY TRUEMAN, ASSISTANT VICE PRINCIPAL\" plays with a pencil. \nTRUEMAN You didn't know this boy? \nBRENDAN No sir, never seen him. \nTRUEMAN And he just hit you? \nBRENDAN Like I said, he asked for my lunch money first. Good thing I brown bagged it. \nTrueman trains a good natured dubious eye on Brendan. \nTRUEMAN Alright Brendan. I've been looking to talk to you. \nBrendan doesn't react. \nTRUEMAN (cont'd) You've helped this office out before. \nBRENDAN No. I gave you Jerr to see him eaten, not to see you fed. \nTRUEMAN Fine, and well put. \nBRENDAN Accelerated English, Mrs. Kasprzyk. \nTRUEMAN Tough teacher? \nBRENDAN Tough but fair. \nTRUEMAN Mm. Anyway then, we know you're clean, and you've, despite your motives, you've been an asset to us. I think you're a good kid. BRENDAN Uh huh. \nTRUEMAN I want to run a couple names by you. \nThe lanky shaved-head kid, whose name is Tugger.   Coming towards him fast. \nBrendan stands there for a moment, then lets the chunk fall to the ground. He casually leans against the car, removes his glasses, puts them in a hard case and puts the hard case in his pocket. \nTugger hits him like a train and throws him across the pavement. Tug turns back to the car and takes out his keys. \nBrendan gets up and comes towards Tug, his face stiff. Tug turns and pops him once squarely in the mouth. Brendan falls to his knees. \nWhile Tug unlocks the door Brendan stands up woozily. Grunting, Tug spins and grabs Brendan's jacket, pushing him back while he slaps him hard in the face, back and forth, three times. When Tug lets go Brendan drops like a stone, catching himself on his hands and knees. The car door slams. \nThe mustang drives about a hundred yards out into the parking lot, spins around and stops, facing Brendan. Its motor purrs deeply. Brendan begins to limp towards it doggedly, head up, eyes fixed. \nA crackling roar and short squeal of tires spit the mustang forward. It comes straight at Brendan, rumbling like a tank. \nBrendan stops walking and stands very still, eyes steady. The gap between him and the car closes in no time at all. \nIt speeds past him not six inches to his left, brushing the edge of his jacket. Brakes squeal behind him. Brendan turns and lopes towards the mustang, idling about fifty feet away. \nHe stops at the window.   Tugger eyes him curiously, with some respect. \nBRENDAN I want to see the Pin. \nTUGGER (nods slightly) Yeah, I guess you do. \nEXT. STREETS \nTwisty and narrow. The black mustang flies through them at impossible speeds, roaring past like a bullet. \nDARKNESS \nLoud engine noise, jostling, grunting. Then a metallic jangle, some scraping, and a CLINK! \nEXT. REAR OF FAST MOVING MUSTANG - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe trunk pops open, revealing Brendan holding a jack rod. \nINT. MOVING MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS \nTug is putting a tape in the deck, eyes down. Behind him the trunk pops open, then pulls down out of sight just as he looks back up. \nINT. TRUNK OF MOVING MUSTANG Brendan holds the trunk about three inches open, just enough to see which street signs pass by. Loud music plays from the car -- \"Sweet Baby James\" by James Taylor.1 \nThe car zooms on. \nBRENDAN'S POV \nThrough the ajar trunk. The mustang slides to a stop beside an elaborate wooden mailbox carved as an eagle's head. Brendan closes the trunk. \nEXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nA small one story house, slightly run down. Tugger opens the trunk and drags Brendan out, covering his eyes with a palm, slams the trunk and goes inside. \nWhen they are gone the broken trunk drifts open. \nINT. BASEMENT HALLWAY \nA very dim narrow hall with a steep stairway at one end, dark doors down the length of it and a lit door at the other end. Tugger drags Brendan down the stairway, drops him and goes into the lit room. \nUnfortunately Mr. Taylor flatly refused, which, given the context, was probably wise. \nBrendan lifts his head painfully. Surrounding him in the darkened doorways are dozens of boys, some dressed like Tugger, others dressed in black. \nTug pokes his head out. \nTUGGER Alright. \nArms pop out of the darkness and drag Brendan towards the lit room. \nINT. KINGPIN'S DEN \nA small room, amazingly messy. Clothes strewn about, groves of empty bottles, precarious piles of books. The overall impression though is not of jumbled chaos, but of a nest, comfortably woven and very worn in. \nA slim figure with wispy hair sits facing the wall at a small desk, writing under a green bookkeeper's lamp. \nBrendan is shoved into the center of the room. Tug and his clones slump against the surrounding walls. Brendan watches the thin figure's back. For a beat the only noise is the scratching of the thin man's pencil. Then he sighs and swivels around. \nMid to late twenties. Sallow features, tired eyes. His clothes are so richly black it is difficult to make out specific items -- he is just one inky black mass from the neck down and eyebrows up. \nKARA Whatever happened to us, Brendan? \nBRENDAN Where's Dode flopped? \nShe turns to face him. \nKARA We were a pair and a half for a few months, weren't we? Sometimes I miss having someone I can talk to. You ever miss having someone? I guess you must. \nBrendan's face is a mask. \nBRENDAN I need to hear Dode's tale about Emily. It's important. \nKARA (darkly) You better be sure you wanna know whatcha wanna know. \nBrendan stands, coughing. \nBRENDAN Uh huh. Laura's working with me now, and I'll have the Pin and Tug in my corner soon. The sooner I get the truth from Dode or the truth about Dode from you, the safer you'll both be. No? Pass it on to Dode anyway. Maybe he'll have the \nsense to get out from under you before he gets hurt. \nKARA You didn't, did you? \nBrendan leaves without looking back. \nINT. BRENDAN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nBrendan's at his desk, on the phone. \nTHE BRAIN (on the phone) So what happens now? \nBRENDAN Now we wait for the Pin's answer. Unless his crew spotted VP Truman's social call this morning, it'll be yes. I'd give us 70/30. If we're in I get under his skin and see what's what. You stick to Kara, keep your specs peeled for Dode and stay away from Laura. \nThe Brain is quiet for a beat. \nTHE BRAIN I think she's with us, Brendan. \nBRENDAN (too sharp) I'll let you know when she is. \nA beat of silence. \nTHE BRAIN Okay. \nBrendan gently replaces the receiver and sits for a moment in silence. \nEXT. LOCKER CAGE - MORNING \nThe class bell rings, and the cage quickly empties. Brendan limps in, opens his locker. A note falls to his feet. It is folded into a star. He pulls it open. \"TWELVE THIRTY PICO & ALEXANDER\". He fishes the old note out and compares them - different handwriting. \nThe locker cage is now empty and silent, except for the steady sound of heavy footfalls. Brendan looks up from the notes. \nA lug with a lumpish face is coming towards him. He wears a black trenchcoat over bulbous shoulders, and his black hair comes down over his eyes like a sheepdog's. \nBRENDAN You the Pin's? \nNo answer. The lug keeps coming. \nBRENDAN (cont'd) So what's his answer? \nCloser, not slowing. Brendan tightens his hand into a fist. Then CLICK! and a long slender switchblade gleams in the lug's right paw. \nBrendan jumps back as the lug swipes the blade at his torso. Before the lug winds up for another slash Brendan is running. \nEXT. CAMPUS SQUARE - DAY \nBrendan runs through the empty campus square, the lug follows. \nEXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY \nWind rushing, sweating, the lug very close. Their footsteps clatter on the cement. Brendan swings around a corner, doubles back and stops with his back to a wall - he's lost sight of him. \nBrendan sweats, listening. The lug's footsteps echo through the hallways, coming from all directions at once. Then it seems clear - he's down the hall on Brendan's right. Brendan dashes left. Wrong. The lug looms over him, his knife hand flashing. Brendan's jacket shoulder tears open, and the white filling inside turns red. He stumbles back blindly, gets his footing and scrambles out of reach. \nBrendan sprints away, down the hall, gaining about thirty feet on the lug before turning the corner. \nBrendan drops to a sitting position. \nTHE LUG AROUND THE CORNER \nVOICE (on the phone) I know what you did. I saw what you did.1 \nThe voice is low and garbled, filtered through something. \nBRENDAN So? \nVOICE Anyone I tell, it would ruin you some way. And I'm going to tell someone. \nBRENDAN Are you making an offer? \nVOICE Maybe. Or maybe I'll just do you in. \nBRENDAN Hire another hash head to blade me? \nOriginally the source of this call was supposed to be a mystery, but during post production we decided it was one layer too many, and identified the caller as Dode. Brendan's first line was overdubbed in post to say `Dode?\" instead of \"So?\" \nVOICE Don't need no blades, shamus. I just gotta squawk. \nBRENDAN What do you want? \nVOICE Just to see you sweat. \nCLICK. Brendan replaces the receiver and stands still for a moment. Then he inserts a coin and dials. \nTHE BRAIN (on the phone) Brendan? \nBRENDAN Yeah. \nTHE BRAIN You alright? \nBRENDAN Yeah, I'm fine. Keep digging on the Burns lug, but the main thing is to find Dode. He set up whatever Emily walked into, it's getting more and more urgent we talk. \nTHE BRAIN Alright. Trueman was looking for you. \nBRENDAN Trueman and the VP? \nTHE BRAIN No, just Trueman. \nBRENDAN Asked for me? \nTHE BRAIN No, but looked. \nBRENDAN That's not good. Alright, keep me posted. \nBrendan hangs up. \nEXT. BEACH - NIGHT1 \nA bonfire burns about a hundred feet off. Figures jump through the blaze to thrash music. The Pin and Brendan wander towards us on the dark beach. \nPIN So I'm going to start you on the dope circles, cleaning up the Turkish dues, pulling in the strags. \nBRENDAN Small fries. \nPIN Yeah, well. Just to see how you handle. Anyway there isn't much else doing. I'm tailing out this big deal, but that's almost done. \nBRENDAN Oh yeah? What was it? \nPIN Big time. Biggest I ever done, and there was a snag in it, but it's almost done now. \nBRENDAN What was it? \nPIN It's over. \nBRENDAN Almost, you said. \nPIN It's over enough. You're gonna make me curious, being so curious. \nThey sit in the sand, facing the breakers. \nPIN (cont'd) I gotta lay something out. You're coming into a certain situation, and I'm bringing you in sort of because of it. \nIf ever you want to witness a look of pure horror, shoot a micro budget feature film and tell your cinematographer that there will be an extended scene on a beach at night. Turns out it's difficult to light up a beach without very large and expensive equipment. Who knew. Shooting at sunset proved a fortunate and less horror inducing solution. \n(beat) I didn't tell Tugger to hit you for the Brad Bramish thing. Laura and I, I decided I oughta hear what you were gunning for before I made an enemy. Tug just did it, though. He was hot, and he just hit you. He's been doing that. \nBRENDAN Yeah? \nBRENDAN (cont'd) (into phone) Mr. Trueman please. \nBrendan compares the two notes from his pocket with Laura's - distinct handwriting on each. \nTRUEMAN (on the phone) This is Trueman. \nBRENDAN What the hell are you doing asking for me in class? \nTRUEMAN What the hell are you doing out of class? \nBRENDAN What? \nTRUEMAN (very deliberate) The VP and I needed to ask you a few questions about Emily Kostich, who you might have heard is missing. It's a very serious thing. The police are involved. The VP and I knew you two were close, so the VP and I came to ask you questions, but you were truant. If you don't have a valid excuse- \nBrendan hangs up. \nTHE BRAIN What? \nBRENDAN I've been cut loose. I'm not safe here. We shouldn't have met in the open. Alright, lay low, but ask on the underneath for Dode. That's all that matters now, find Dode, but do it on the underneath, got it? \nTHE BRAIN What are you going to do? \nBRENDAN I'd like to have played it safe, but there's no time. The Pin's not letting \nanything drop, so I gotta push things a bit. \nTHE BRAIN How? \nBRENDAN I don't know. Just find Dode. \nEXT. THE PIN'S HOUSE - DAY \nThe bird of prey mailbox looms ominously. Brendan knocks on the front door. No answer. He presses lightly on the screen door, and it gives. \nINT. KITCHEN - SAME \nEmpty. Brendan crosses the warped linoleum and gently opens the narrow basement door. He descends into inky gloom. \nINT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME Deathly still and silent. Barely breathing, Brendan goes to the lit doorway at the end of the hall. \nINT. PIN'S DEN - SAME \nEmpty. Brendan floats through the room like a ghost, to the Pin's desk. \nSlowly, then with greater confidence he rifles through it - papers and trinkets, meaningless. \nHe reaches beneath the desk, knocking it gently with his knuckles. Quickly he removes the top drawer and reaches down into the desk frame. \nBrendan draws out a stack of hundred dollar bills two inches thick. He pulls out another. Another. Another. Thumbing the stacks -- pure hundreds. \nSomething creaks in the hallway. \nBrendan freezes. Silently he replaces the money and drawer, his eyes on the doorway. He creeps towards the door on the balls of his feet. \nINT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME \nStill empty. Brendan creeps towards the stairs, passing other doorways, all open but for one. He stops for a moment, listening - silence. \nINT. STORAGE ROOM - SAME \nBrendan enters the room - pitch black but for a small high window. Brendan pulls the curtains aside. A beam of sunlight spills just enough light to reveal a figure in the dark. Brendan jumps back, and his reflection in the large mirror jumps as well. \nA white bird nesting in the window flutters into the dark room. \nBrendan walks the large mirror into the beam of light, reflecting it around the room like a flashlight. More junk, a mattress, then a strangely bare corner with a single white lump in it. The white bird stands behind the lump, its dark eyes caught in the bare light. \nThe bird flies out the window. \nBrendan goes to the white lump, a small brick of white powder. White chalky residue patterns the floor -- there were other bricks there before. \nBehind Brendan, in the mirror, something moves. Someone else, in the room. \nTugger. He throws Brendan across the room, then heaves him into a wall. \nTUGGER What with the poking, genius?! Maybe you're poking for your bull friends! \nBRENDAN Don't be a sap. I can't even face up at school, the VP's so hot for me. \nTUGGER Emily? \nPIN Emily Kostich. Where she's at now. Says we'd want to know. Wants to meet. \nTUGGER (uncomfortable) Yeah? \nPIN So we'll meet him. Four o'clock. (to Brendan) Emily was Tug's girl for awhile. You know Emily, didn't you? BRENDAN A while back. \nPIN You've heard she's missing? \nBRENDAN Yeah, I heard that. \nPIN So maybe you want to come along too. \nBRENDAN What has Emily got to do with you? \nPIN (looks at Tugger) Show, maybe we'll find out. \nHe gives a slip of paper to Tugger. \nPIN (cont'd) Four o'clock. \nTugger glances at the slip, then slides it to Brendan. It has the symbol drawn in pencil: \nA horn honks outside. \nBRENDAN That's my ride. \nThe Pin calls after him as he leaves. \nPIN Four o'clock. \nEXT. FRONT OF PIN'S HOUSE - SAME \nBrendan falls into Laura's idling car. \nBRENDAN (roughly) A payphone, anywhere. \nLAURA What- \nBrendan throws the car into drive, and they jerk forward. \nEXT. STREET CORNER - DAY \nPAYPHONE The mobile customer you have called is away from the phone- \nBrendan slams the phone down violently and walks back towards the car. His legs quiver, and a coughing fit hits. \nHacking and spluttering he falls to his knees. Laura's arms wrap around him, except it isn't Laura, it's Emily. Brendan spins backwards into \nDARKNESS \nEmily kissing his mouth, her hair around him, but it isn't her hair, it's Laura's. Brendan shoots upwards \nINT. LAURA'S CAR STATIONARY - DAY \nand sits up with a jolt. Laid out in the back seat, Laura dabbing his head with a wet napkin. \nBRENDAN (barks shakily) What time is it? \nLAURA Lie down, Brendan- BRENDAN What time- \nLAURA You've got a fever, you've got to go to the hospital or- \nBRENDAN What time is it? \nLAURA Three forty. You've got to rest, you're feverish. \nHe throws himself out of the car. \nEXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - SAME \nBrendan falls to his knees, coughing. Laura follows. \nLAURA Get back in the car, I'm taking you home, you're sick, you need- \nBRENDAN Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! \nBRENDAN What was yours? DODE I loved her. And I woulda loved the kid. I'm gonna bury you. \nBrendan's face is empty. Dode walks stiffly away. Brendan puts a hand on his shoulder, but shrinks back in a coughing spasm. Dode grabs Brendan's wrist and hits him in the face. Brendan hits the pavement. \nEXT. HEAVEN - DAY \nBright clouds, sharp light. Emily flies towards us, glowing, then dimmer, her wings splutter out, the clouds turn gray, and we are looking at Emily's picture in the newspaper article. \nEXT. BASKETBALL FIELD - DAY \nBrendan pulls the newspaper off his face, lying in a fetal position. Dode is nowhere to be seen. \nSlowly, painfully, Brendan hoists himself up. He coughs and splutters, barely able to keep his footing. \nHe limps across the field. Every step is agony. The wind blows against him. The black field seems impossibly long, still he keeps limping forward, towards the ravine. \nEXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL - DAY Brendan slides down the embankment, landing on his feet. \nGathered around the drain tunnel entrance are Tugger, the Pin, five of Tugger's flunkies and Dode in the middle. Everyone looks at Brendan. \nA long silence. Brendan clears his throat. \nBRENDAN What'd I miss? \nMore silence. \nPIN Dode here says Emily Kostich is dead. \nNobody reacts to that. Brendan's face is placid. \nBRENDAN Oh yeah? \nPIN Yeah. He says he knows who did it. He says he knows where the body's at. (beat of silence) And he says he wants more money than I think the information's worth. BRENDAN That so, Dode? (to the Pin) \nSo walk. What's the info have to do with you anyways? \nDODE Plenty. \nPIN Plenty, he says. \nBRENDAN Uh huh. And he wants cash on the nail. He's a pot skulled reef worm with more hop in his head than blood. Why pay for dirt you can't believe? \nDODE You'll believe this. \nBRENDAN (shrugs) Maybe you will. \nDODE You'll believe it, cause it's someone close to you. Real close. \nThe Pin looks up at Brendan, whose face is loose and nonchalant. \nBRENDAN Maybe it's hot, but it's Dode, you can't trust it. \nDODE Real close. \nTugger's eyes are locked on Dode, his scar the color of raw liver. Brendan laughs and turns away. \nBRENDAN I'm getting my shoes wet for this. Let him milk you if you want. \nPIN (to Brendan) Stay. (to Dode) It's still too much. \nDODE No it's not. You won't complain when you hear it. \nTugger twists a stick in his hands. Brendan watches him, curious. \nBRENDAN (murmurs) So maybe you should. \nDODE You had her against the wall with the brick - \nPIN I know my business. It's still too much. \nDODE (with growing confidence) It's not, cause that's not why she was killed, and it's real important to you, cause the person who killed her's real close, and cause he's got a lot to lose, and he knows if I don't bury him by spilling to you I spill to the bulls and bury him for real, and he's really really scared - she had a kid in her and he couldn't stand - \nTugger springs like a cat.     He grabs Dode's hair and knees his face. \nBrendan stumbles towards them. \nBRENDAN Tug, it's alright! \nTUGGER Hell I don't. BRENDAN The Pin's sitting on the brick profits - hitting him now would be post. Make peace and wait for your chance. \nLAURA He's right, Tug. Smooth it out. \nBRENDAN (between coughs) Besides, he's got you on the Dode thing. War'll mean you vs. him and every bull in the burgh. \nTugger turns away, thinking. \nTUGGER Yeah, we'll talk. \nLAURA (to Brendan) You going? \nBRENDAN Yeah. \nShe nods. Brendan stumbles into the bedroom. \nINT. TUGGER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBrendan lies on his back. Sweat stands on his forehead. \nTHE FAN \nSpinning dizzily from Brendan's POV. Then the fan is still and the room is spinning, then the fan, then the room. Brendan clamps his eyes shut. A door creaks open. \nBRENDAN (croaks) Go away. \nLaura floats across the room to him. Her hair falls around him. Brendan shrinks back. She puts a pale hand on his clammy forehead. Brendan tries to speak, but cannot. \nHe fingers slide over his face. She pulls off his glasses. \nHer hands all over his face. Brendan's throat contorts in a hard swallow. His eyes are wet. \nHer hair, her hands all warm and gentle, touching him. \nLAURA I'm sorry Brendan. \nBrendan breaks. In silent sobs first, then shivering with an almighty release he cries like a baby in her arms. \nTHE FAN \nSpinning above them. \nLaura lights a cigarette. They lie beside each other. \nLAURA Don't go tonight. \nBRENDAN I've got to make sure it plays out smooth. \nLAURA It'll play however it plays without you there. \nBRENDAN I've got to make sure. \nLAURA Why? BRENDAN Cause if there's war, I'm in it too. \nLAURA Well let's just, I mean why not just run away. Go somewhere. I've got a car. (Brendan gives a wry look) I've got an aunt in New Orleans, she wouldn't care. (Brendan grins) Yeah, it's a stupid thing, but think about it, why not? What, school? C'mon. Family? \nBRENDAN Alright, stop. \nHer smoke drifts into the fan. LAURA I wasn't serious, but we could go for awhile. Just until everything clears. \nBrendan watches the smoke. She stubs the butt out in an ash tray on the table and curls against his chest. \nStretching his arm across the table, he nonchalantly spins the ash tray around with his finger. \nHis glasses lay on the table. Through the left lens the cigarette is magnified. Pale blue arrow on the filter. \nLaura's arm stretches across his chest. He looks at it, then up at the fan, spinning. \nLATER \nBrendan slips out of bed. A glowing clock radio reads \nINT. TUGGER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nA swarm of silent activity. Tug's flunkies prepare various weapons. Brendan goes to Tug. \nBRENDAN Tell your boys no knuckle business. \nBRENDAN It's yours. \nPIN That aint the point. I'm gonna start selling it. How do I know it aint bad? \nBRENDAN Why would it be? \nPIN Why was the last one? Cause someone got greedy. Tug here's had the means to swipe half and cut it bad for a long time. Now we're splits my loss of trust's retroactive. \nBRENDAN Did you, Tug? \nTUGGER (eyes hot on the Pin) No. \nBRENDAN Alright, so let's shake and blow. \nPIN Not good enough. \nTug shoots to his feet, kicking away his chair. BRENDAN What would be good enough? \nPIN I wanna see him dose it. Just to prove it. Then we're square. \nTUGGER Hell for that! I didn't touch your junk, that's it. \nPIN I wanna see it. \nTUGGER To hell! \nPIN Your not wanting to dose it's telling me something right here. \nTUGGER Yeah, it better be! It's telling that I'm out from your thumb, that I aint playing lapdog to no gothed up cripple no more! \nEveryone in the room is on their feet.   Brendan steps forward. \nBRENDAN I'll dose it. \nAll eyes to him, unbelieving. \nPIN What? \nBRENDAN If it'll shut you two apes up I'll   take the dose, and if I don't die we're   all right as rain, and if I do die you   two have your war, so long as you keep   it off my grave. Deal? \nPIN Fine.   Tangles. \nBRENDAN Johnny, go with him. They go. \nTug just stares at Brendan, then tosses his hands up slightly and turns away. \nThey all wait. \nCRASH! from the next room. Everyone freezes. More breaking, then scuffling and shouting. \nThe two punks look at their bosses, then run out. Tug starts to follow, but Brendan holds him back. \nThe noise through the wall grows tremendous, a full brawl. The ceiling pounds and shudders with footfalls and bodies hitting the ground. \nThen, from not too far away, a gunshot. \nThe Pin stands and goes towards the door, but Brendan shouts \nBRENDAN (cont'd) No! \nand slams it shut. A few tense seconds. \nAnother gunshot. Footfalls, then Tangles falls through the door, his chest red. The Pin bends over him. \nTANGLES (gasping) The brick, it's gone. The brick's gone. \nTangles stops gasping. The Pin stands, eyes blazing at Tug. \nPIN Make peace, huh? Talk it out? Get your boys in my den soes you could snag it under my nose? \nTug's scar is fiery red. He coils his body, snarling. \nTUGGER Alright! \nBRENDAN No, that's not- \nPIN Was it bad, Tug? Snag it so I don't know, or sell it off to flat the war odds? \nBRENDAN Did she blow last night? \nTHE BRAIN No. Stayed there till six thirty, then walked to school. \nBRENDAN You didn't give her a ride, did you? \nTHE BRAIN No. \nBRENDAN But she came straight to school from Tug's? \nTHE BRAIN Yeah. \nBRENDAN She there now? \nTHE BRAIN Yeah. Not with me, but here. \nBRENDAN Alright. Tell her I wanna meet up on the basketball field in half an hour, then go home and get some sleep. \nTHE BRAIN Alright. Brendan hangs up, then pauses, lost in thought. \nEXT. SIDE OF GYM - LATER \nBrendan sits against the massive gym building, writing on a piece of looseleaf paper. \nEXT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - LATER Brendan slips the paper under a door stenciled \"VP Offices\". \nEXT. BASKETBALL FIELD - LATER \nCold, barren. Wind whistles softly and jangles the metal mesh basketball nets like windchimes. \nBrendan stands crookedly, hands in pockets, eyes trained on the cold black horizon. A speck appears. Brendan waits for it, bracing himself against the wind. \nLaura. She puts her arms around him, a warm embrace. Brendan draws back. \nLAURA (softly) Did you see it all? With Tug and the Pin? \nBrendan looks at her a moment. \nBRENDAN No. I took your advice and didn't go. \nLAURA (confused) No? \nBRENDAN What happened? \nLaura looks at him strangely, a little uneasy. \nLAURA The papers say six dead, three around the house, one girl in the trunk of Tug's car, and the Pin and Tug. \nBrendan's face is frozen in an ambiguous frown. \nBRENDAN Yeah? LAURA Tug tried to shoot his way out when the police got there. They tied him to Dode, too. Same gun. And the girl. \nBRENDAN Huh. LAURA Well good thing you weren't there. \nBRENDAN Yeah. \nLaura's face softens a bit. \nLAURA You think the girl was Emily? \nBRENDAN Probably. \nLaura embraces him again, and doesn't let go. \nLAURA You loved her. \nBRENDAN (distant) Yeah I did. \nLAURA You did all this cause you loved her. And now it's finished. (tightens her embrace) I love you. \nBRENDAN No. \nLaura pulls back, looks at his face. It is a mask. \nLAURA What? \nBRENDAN No, it's not finished. Tug pulled the trigger on Em and he got the fall, but the bulls coulda found that out without me. Laura pulls back more. \n", "test1_input": "Brendan puts on his glasses, stands to go. \nBRENDAN No, bulls would gum it. They'd flash their dusty standards at the wide-eyes and probably find some yegg to pin, probably even the right one. But they'd trample the real tracks and scare the real players back into their holes, and if we're doing this I want the whole story. No cops, not for a bit. \nTHE BRAIN So what first? \nBRENDAN I don't know. Your mom still have the cell? \nTHE BRAIN In her car. \nBRENDAN Borrow it for a few days, get me the number. (stands to go) Wait for my word, and cover for me first period. I'm going to be a little late. \nEXT. BASKETBALL FIELD - DAY \nA vast field of asphalt segmented by a dozen basketball courts outlined in cracked paint.1 Brendan trudges across it, his steps heavy. He stops and stands very still, staring at the ground for a beat then raising his eyes to \nTHE HORIZON \nFlat, gray, pin straight. Brendan's voice starts speaking rapidly, confident and clear. \nThis describes the location at my school that the \"showdown\" scenes were originally written for. Between when I wrote the script and when we shot it, however, the school expanded and built portable classrooms on the basketball field, and so we reluctantly moved these scenes to the football field. \nBRENDAN (O.S.) Yeah it was personal. Jerr spooked some decent gees and ran around some what was straight with him, but I'm nobody's bull runner. This wasn't a business sit. But yeah. I bulled him. Got in tight, partnered up and sent him over. \nPAN AROUND to reveal BRENDAN. He looks different, edgier, more alive, wearing different clothes and a thin goatee1. He keeps talking directly at us. \nBRENDAN (cont'd) I'd bull the lot of them, Em, I'd burn down the whole party if they tried to play you again. Jerr and whoever's next. I want to keep you safe. \nAn ARM swings into frame, wearing cheap plastic bracelets and pale blue fingernail polish. It slaps Brendan hard in the face. He catches it. Emily wrenches her arm away and stumbles backwards onto the pavement. \nBrendan grabs her sleeve. She twists away. He grabs her shoulder, grabs her waist, she resists, and suddenly they are struggling with violent pent up intensity until with a shout she breaks away and falls to the ground. \nA beat.     Gulls cry in the distance. \nEMILY You can't keep me safe, Brendan. I'm in a bigger world now, and you can't hide me from it, and you can't beat it. Not if I don't want you to. \nBrendan's face looks lumpish, while Emily's is strong. She stands and walks off into the distance across the barren field. \nBRENDAN'S FACE \nWatching her go. It is back to present day, pale, clean shaven, sullen. His eyes are cold with resolve. \nEXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL - EARLY MORNING \nBrendan sloshes down into the water. Without delicacy he lifts Emily's body and pulls her back into the tunnel. \nINT. RUNOFF TUNNEL \nWhich Joe would not even consider, thank god. \nPitch back. Brendan lays the body down. Two beady eyes peer at him from the darkness - he freezes. The eyes hop forward - a gull. The two watch each other for a moment, then the gull squawks and flutters out the bright mouth of the tunnel. Brendan follows it without looking back at the body.1 \nEXT. CROWDED HALLWAY - DAY \nBrendan and the Brain lean against a wall. The Brain slips him a piece of paper. \nTHE BRAIN There's the cell number. \nBRENDAN Keep it on vibrate. \nTHE BRAIN (pats his jacket pocket) Yeah. \nBRENDAN Better stop meeting me in the open too. I'm going to start getting visible, and I need you on the underneath. I'll call. \nTHE BRAIN Trueman asked for you. Wants words in his office. \nBRENDAN I bet. Keep him off me - stonewall him, he won't bite, just keep him away from me. \nTHE BRAIN I'll try. So what's first? \nBRENDAN Make Em's troubles mine. I'm going to throw a few words at you, tell me if they catch. Brick. \nTHE BRAIN No. \nA very early draft held on the tunnel after Brendan left, and revealed a dark figure (Dode) creeping away from the top of the tunnel, causing the pebble described on page 1 to plink into the water. \nBRENDAN Or bad brick. \n", "test1_true": "BRENDAN Tug. \nTHE BRAIN Tug... that might be a drink. \nBRENDAN Drink? \nTHE BRAIN Vodka and milk or something, or maybe not. \nBRENDAN Poor Frisco. \nTHE BRAIN Frisco. Frisco Farr1 was a sophomore last year, I think. Real trash, maybe hit a class a week. Didn't know him then, and haven't seen him around. \nBRENDAN Pin. \nTHE BRAIN Pin... the Pin? \nBRENDAN The Pin, yeah. \nTHE BRAIN The Pin's kind of a local spook story. You know the Kingpin? BRENDAN I've heard it. \nTHE BRAIN Same thing. Supposed to be old, like 26, lives in town. \nAll apologies to Frisco Farr, who the author did actually go to school with, and who was neither a druggie nor `real trash', but was a great guy who simply had a very cool sounding name. He is now (the author was horrified to learn) practicing law. \nBRENDAN Jake1 runner, right? \nTHE BRAIN Big time... maybe. Ask any dope rat where their junk sprang they'll say they scraped it from that who scored it from this who bought it off so, and after four or five connections the list'll always end with the Pin. But I'll becha you got every rat in town together and said 'show your hands' if any of them've actually seen the Pin, you'd get a crowd of full pockets. \nBRENDAN You think the Pin's just a tale to take whatever heat? \nTHE BRAIN (shrugs. Beat) But what's first? \nBRENDAN A show of hands. \nINT. BACKSTAGE OF THEATER \nBrendan strides past forest scenery and drama geeks, through another door and into sunlight. \nEXT. BACK OF THEATER - DAY \nKara smokes a cigarette. Brendan leans beside her. \nKARA (annoyed) Hey Brendan. Here for the show? \nBRENDAN No. \nKARA Would you go then, honey, cause I've got this headache. \nBRENDAN Try smoking like a chimney, I've heard that helps. \nIn an admittedly paltry concession to clarity, this was changed to `Dope runner' in post production. \nBrendan grabs the pack of cigarettes. \nBRENDAN (cont'd) Isn't this Dode's brand? \nKara snaps her head towards him, a flash of anger. She catches herself and smiles cooly. \nKARA You don't know Dode's brand. \nBRENDAN Oh I do now. \nAngry again, Kara snatches the pack from him. \nBRENDAN (cont'd) I'm going to start shaking things up. Give me the story and you might miss the bite. KARA The story about what? \nBRENDAN Alright. \nHe turns and walks away. \nKARA The story about what? \nBRENDAN I don't want to play games if you've got a headache. Get me if you want to spill it, but I can't guarantee safe passage after tonight. \nKARA I don't know what- At the stage door, not slowing. \n", "test1_id": 2256, "test2_input": "BRENDAN Water's fine, ma'am, thanks. \nMOTHER Now just a moment, we have apple juice here, if you'd like that, or milk, though you've got that in your cornflakes, I don't know if drinking it as well might be too much. \nBRENDAN Apple juice sounds terrific. \nMOTHER It's country style. \nBRENDAN That's perfect. \nShe shuts the fridge. Tugger and the Pin sit behind her, looking comfortably bored. The Pin, a sharp black hole against the soft yellow kitchen, eats oatmeal cookies with small delicate bites. \nMOTHER I'll even give it to you in a country glass, how'd that be? Boys? \nTUGGER I'm fine, Mrs. M. \nPIN Thanks, mom. \nThe Pin kisses her on the cheek. \nMOTHER Okay, well I'm going to go, um, do something in the other room now... \nShe shuffles out. \nPIN (to Brendan) So hows bout we take another snap at hearing your tale? \nBRENDAN I don't know. It starts out same as before, and this floor ain't carpeted. \nPIN We're cooled off. \nBRENDAN Yeah well, your muscle seemed plenty cool putting his fist in my head. I want him out. \nThe Pin grins thinly, uncomfortable. \nPIN Looky, soldier- \nBRENDAN The ape blows or I clam. \nTUGGER (stands violently) So clam! What've you got I can't beat out of you back in the basement? \nThe Pin and Brendan are perfectly still, watching each other. \nPIN Give us a few minutes, Tug. \nTug turns to him, but Pin keeps his eyes on Brendan. \nPIN (cont'd) I'll call you if whatever. \nBeat. Tug stomps off, slamming the narrow door hard behind him. The Pin goes back to gnawing his cookie. \nPIN (cont'd) So? \nBrendan sets down his spoon. \nBRENDAN About a year ago I had a small time dealing partnership with Jerr Madison. Know him? \nPIN Till he took the fall for you. \nBRENDAN Yeah well. I didn't ask him to, but he was a straight player. I got out clean - almost. Nothing on my official record, but the VPs play it like I owe them one. When I made it clear I wasn't playing their hound dog, well they didn't like it. They keep calling me in, badgering me. \nPIN Gee that's tough. \nBRENDAN I don't like being told whose side I'm on. So now they think I'm on your trail, I'm in a nice spot to know their movements and feed them yours. \nPIN I gotcha. \nBRENDAN You haven't got me yet. \nPIN What, price? \nBRENDAN Considering the benefits my services could yield, I don't think that's unreasonable. \nPIN And what are your services exactly, just so I can be specific on the invoice? \nBRENDAN (shrugs) Whatever serves your interests. \nThe Pin stands. \n", "test2_true": "Brendan stands but doesn't follow as the Pin opens the narrow door Tugger went through and descends the dark stairs behind. \nPIN (cont'd) We're done. \nThe moment the Pin vanishes into the basement's murk Laura comes up out of it. She takes Brendan's hand. \nLAURA I'll drive you back. INT. LAURA'S CONVERTIBLE MOVING - SUNSET \nThey zig zag though the twisty suburban streets. Brendan stares sullenly into space. \nBRENDAN Just drop me at school. (they take a hard turn) How long was I out? \nLAURA Half an hour. It took all of it for me to cool the Pin down. \nBRENDAN (flatly, but sincerely) Thanks. \nThey drive on in silence. \nEXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DUSK \nLaura's convertible stops, and Brendan climbs out painfully. He studies her face for a moment. \nLAURA You trust me now? \nBRENDAN Less than when I didn't trust you before. If you can tell me your angle in this, maybe I can. \nLAURA Come here.1 \nBrendan leans on the car, his face close to hers. \nLAURA (CONT'D) (cont'd) I'm on the in, top level of the tower and I know everyone, but I don't know all what goes on. I knew Em when she tried to get with me and Brad, and I liked her. She was smart. But she wasn't us, and it didn't work. When she left she took some souvenirs, dirty habits she wasn't strong enough to control and a connection to the Pin to keep them going. With me? \nBRENDAN So far. \nLAURA A few months go by, and the next I hear the Pin's raging over a situation with some certain junk Em was partial to, and the downfall's coming on Em's head. \nBRENDAN You think Em scraped the junk off the Pin? \nNot to weasel in a plug, but the original version of this scene (shot as written) is on the deleted scenes section of the DVD. Available at fine retailers everywhere. \nLAURA I don't know, but whether she scraped or copped or just ran her tab around the world and into her own back, it must have been grand. I've never seen the Pin so hot. \nBRENDAN This all helps but it's not what I asked. What's your angle in all this? \nLAURA I don't know. I'm usually pretty sharp, but... maybe I see what you're doing for Emily, trying to help her. And I don't know anyone who would do that for me. \nBRENDAN Now you are dangerous. \nThrowing the car in gear, she peels out and leaves him standing alone in the fading evening light. \nINT. BACKSTAGE \nBrendan pushes through the gloom, past forest scenery, deeper and deeper until he comes to a door. \nINT. WOMAN'S DRESSING ROOM \nHazy and cramped. Everything blends into the color of flesh. No walls are visible; it is all billowy piles of costumes. Brendan pushes in. Kara sits at the mirror, putting on eyeliner. \nKARA (sing song) Brendan Brendan Brendan! \nBRENDAN Where's Dode flopped? (she makes a face) I know you two are cozed up, so you'll tell me or you won't. \nKARA Oooh, getting feisty. (giggles) Last time we talked you were giving ultimate-tims. \nBRENDAN It worked. You went to Laura, didn't you? Told her my tale. \nKARA All part of your plan? \nBRENDAN Turned out to be. \nKARA I feel so cheap and used. \nBRENDAN Gol, I must seem a real cad. Sometimes I just hate myself. \nKara grins dreamily. \n", "test2_id": 2257, "test3_input": "BRENDAN Yeah. \nTHE BRAIN Are you - what, man, have you heard about Dode- \nBRENDAN I was there. \nTHE BRAIN You- \nBRENDAN Where were you yesterday? I called. \nTHE BRAIN Kasprzyk took my phone, turned it off. I just now got it back. \nBRENDAN Alright, listen- \nTHE BRAIN Are you okay? \nBRENDAN Just listen. Is my name in the papers with the story? \nTHE BRAIN No. \nBRENDAN Alright. Is it just Dode in the papers? THE BRAIN Yeah. What do you mean? \nBRENDAN Listen, I'm going to be calling you tonight, probably late. Sleep with your phone on. Could you get a car if you needed to? \nTHE BRAIN If it's late enough I could take my mom's- \nBRENDAN Be ready then. I'll call. \nTHE BRAIN Alright. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nBrendan kicks in the door. Kara sits in front of the mirror in a soft pink robe, a boy on the floor beside her. She gasps. \nKARA Brendan. Did you hear about Dode? \nBRENDAN You scheming tramp. You set that poor kid up, you hid him, fed him your tale. You got info from Laura and held Dode like a card till you could play him. For money! \nBrendan throws a chair. The boy stands. \nKARA I don't know what you're talking about. \nBRENDAN You'd bury me at the same time, but it was mostly for the money. You got Dode thinking Em had his kid, thinking I did it, and that was enough for him, but he stuck to the money cause you had your claws in him, cause he couldn't come away from the deal without it and make you happy. \nKARA Sit down, you're a mess. Russ, go get my shoes from the wardrobe locker, would you sweetie? \nHe goes, trying to look mean at Brendan. Brendan and Kara watch each other like caged rats. \nKARA (cont'd) Still wish you knew what you wanted to know? If it's any consolation, it probably wasn't Dode's kid. It might have been Tug's, but frankly I wouldn't bet a horse - it was a crowded field there at the end. \nBrendan grabs a clock and throws it. Kara's mirror shatters, revealing a grimy dark wall behind. \nKARA (cont'd) Meany. You want my tale, Brendan? I still know what Dode was selling, but I'd play it smart. A quick call from a payphone to copland, they drag the tunnel and you're through. \nShe comes very close to him. Her robe falls open slightly. \nKARA (cont'd) Five thousand. Cash. I know you can get it from the Pin, but even if you can't I want it by first period tomorrow, or I play my hand and bury you. \nShe turns away, lets her robe fall.1 \nKARA (cont'd) Now get out. \nBrendan's eyes burn. He lunges at her. \nEXT. BACKSTAGE - SAME \nDrama geeks sit in groups. The dressing room door flies open and Kara flies out, stark naked. Brendan flies out after her. \nKARA What are you doing? \nBRENDAN Showing your ace. \nBrendan storms out. \nAlso on the DVD. Fine retailers everywhere. \nEXT. PIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT \n", "test3_true": "VOICE Far enough. \nThe Pin. \nPIN Everyone's paying social calls. \nBRENDAN Laura here? \nBeat of silence. \nPIN So? BRENDAN So what are the stats? \nPIN The stats are war, soon as the press heat dies. And if you're with him, you're with him. \nBRENDAN Tug got hot. He panicked. \nPIN Tug's been after my digs from the get go. \nBRENDAN No. He's been anxious cause he thought if you found out he killed Emily you'd turn him over. PIN He was right. \nBRENDAN Yeah, well. \nPIN I told him to get the straight, no roughing. I wasn't even there. \nBRENDAN Alright. So he's a hot head. So you don't want him on your side, at least let's have a pow wow fore we start digging trenches. Maybe we can all walk away amiable enemies. What would it take? \nPIN I don't know. We'd have to square everything between us. He owes me some money. \nBRENDAN Alright, but we can talk. \nPIN Yeah, alright. \nBRENDAN Four o'clock. \nPIN Tomorrow? \nBRENDAN Tonight. Let's clear it all before it boils up again. \nPIN Four tonight. You'll be here? \nBRENDAN Yeah. \nBrendan turns away. \nLAURA (OS) Wait! She comes out of the house with her purse. \nLAURA (cont'd) I'll drive you back. \nINT. LAURA'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT \nLaura drives, Brendan stares at the passing lights. LAURA What's going to happen? \nBrendan coughs. \nLAURA (cont'd) Do you feel better? \nBRENDAN (weak) I don't know. \nINT. TUGGER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nBrendan stumbles in. Tug's hands grab him roughly. \nTUGGER For a smart guy you aint too smart. I said lay low. \nLaura enters. \nLAURA Tug. \nHe drops Brendan. Laura kneels beside Brendan, feeling his forehead. \nBRENDAN She was at the Pin's. \nTUGGER Yeah, she's our go-between. \nBRENDAN Uh huh. So here's the sit. You and the Pin are going to pow wow, four o'clock tonight, his place. Take all the muscle you want, you won't need it. He wants to talk straight, and you're going to work with him for whatever he needs, cause you don't want war. \n", "test3_id": 2258}

{"test1_input": "BRENDAN Tell the Pin that Brad was my calling card, and I need words. \nKARA Brad Bramish? Through the door and into the theater. \nINT. BACKSTAGE OF THEATER - CONTINUOUS \nHe spins to see Kara's face just before the door closes. She's worried. \nEXT. CROWDED SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY \nThe Brain walks out of a classroom and Brendan swings behind him. \nBRENDAN (fast and low) Tail Kara through lunch. She's got rehearsal but she'll blow early. She goes home, drop her, else wait for my call. \nThe Brain turns and Brendan's gone. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - LUNCH Brendan wanders through the thick lunchtime crowd towards a cluster of 3 or 4 flashy luxury cars set aside at the far end of the lot. \nBrad Bramish sits slouched in the front seat of his convertible, front door open. A small crowd hangs about Brad, his crony Biff at his elbow. \nBRAD That's all I'm saying, is put me in the game and I'll do what needs to be done, but they don't put me in, what needs doing don't get done and don't come crying to me, man. Get off my grill man, you didn't put me in, don't come to me if you didn't let me play. \nBIFF They didn't! \nBrendan scans the rest of the cars. His eyes catch on Laura Dannon sitting in another convertible, off to the side. Her bright eyes cut through the crowd, straight into Brendan. \nHe wags his eyebrows at her. She looks away. Brendan walks into Brad's direct line of view and obviously leans against one of the cars. \nBRAD Hey! What are you doing here? \nBRENDAN Listening. \nBRAD Uh huh. \nBRENDAN Alright, you got me. I'm a scout for the Gophers. \nBRAD (not amused) Oh yeah? \nBRENDAN Of all things, yeah. Been watching your game for a month, but that story just now clenched it. You've got heart, kid. How soon can you move to Minneapolis? \nA few snickers around the crowd, but nowhere near Brad. \nBRAD (flat with anger) Yeah? \nBRENDAN Cold winters, but they've got a great public transit system. \nBRAD Yeah? \nBRENDAN Yeah. \nBRAD Oh yeah? \nBRENDAN There's a thesaurus in the library. 'Yeah's under 'Y'. Go ahead, I'll wait. \nBRAD Who invited you? \nBRENDAN To the parking lot? Well gee I kind of invited myself. \nBRAD I think you'd better leave then. \nBRENDAN No, I'm having too good a time. \nBRAD Just the same. \nBrendan smiles slightly, and very deliberately crosses his legs. Brad's face tenses. \nBRAD (cont'd) Maybe you want to go someplace more private. \nBRENDAN With you? \nBrad says 'who else?' by lifting his arms. \nBRENDAN (cont'd) (as if he's been asked to the movies) Sure. \nBrendan stands and walks off. Brad follows and the rest of the crowd trails after him. \nHe leads them behind a parked VW van and turns to face Brad. People gather around in a wide circle. \n", "test1_true": "BRAD You know what's good for you you'll just beat it. Beating a small frye won't win me anything and it's not going to do you any good- \nLaura pulls up in her convertible, behind Brad, watching. \nIn the next moment Brendan cuts Brad off by putting his fist in his face. \nBrad grunts but doesn't lose ground. Brendan throws his short stocky frame into Brad's larger one and tenderizes his midsection with jabs. \nBrad tags Brendan in the ribs, then smacks the palm of his hand into Brendan's face, shoving him back onto the pavement. \nHe comes at Brendan with his big fists clenched. \nBrendan kicks Brad full force in the shins. \nBrad tumbles, and Brendan comes up fast, connecting hard with the point of Brad's chin. Brad gets his balance fast, and before Brendan can throw another he throws one himself, then another, both into Brendan's stomach. Brendan pulls back and kicks Brad's shin where he had kicked it before. Brad roars and hits Brendan very hard in the face. \nBrendan bounces back like a rubber ball and throws his weight into a square punch right into Brad's nose. \nThe sound of eggs breaking, and Brad falls backwards like a board. \nHe stays down, holding his face. \nBrendan staggers back, breathing hard, and looks up at the small crowd. Some stare at Brendan, some at Brad, but nobody seems about to do anything. Brendan runs his sleeve over his face and walks unsteadily off, pushing past the last few people rushing over. \nSTRAGGLER Hey, is there a fight? \nBRENDAN Yeah. \nHe throws a last look at Laura, who meets his gaze and drives off. \nEXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS \nBrendan walks away from the lot, towards the school. Laura pulls up beside him in her car. \nLAURA Hey. \nBrendan ignores her and b-lines for the school. Laura brakes hard, parking by the curb. EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nBrendan limps down the hallway.    Laura appears behind him, trotting to catch up. \nLAURA You're quite a pill. BRENDAN Uh huh. \nLAURA Where are you going? \nBRENDAN Home. \nLAURA Why did you take a powder the other night? \nBRENDAN Same reason I'm taking one now. \nLAURA Hold it. (he keeps walking) I don't get you. That's a chilly heel to be giving a girl who's where you want to know about. \nBRENDAN I'll get where I'm going just fine. \nLAURA I want to help you. \nBRENDAN Go away. \nSilence behind him. He stops, turns wearily. She looks genuinely hurt. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) (cont'd) Look, I can't trust you. You ought to be smart enough to know that. I didn't shake the party up to get your attention, and I'm not heeling you to hook you. Your connections could help me, but the bad baggage they bring could make it zero sum game or even hurt me, so I'm better off coming at it clean. \nLAURA I wouldn't have to lead you in by the hand- \nBRENDAN I can't trust you. Brad was a sap, you weren't, you were with him and so you were playing him, so you're a player. With you behind me I'd have to tie one eye up watching both your hands, and I can't spare it. \nLAURA You're not Brad. \nBRENDAN No, I'm not. \nHe turns and walks away. She doesn't follow. \nEXT. SCHOOL PAYPHONE - AFTERNOON \nBrendan slumps against it, receiver to his ear, licking a bruised lip. He wears dark glasses. \n", "test1_id": 2256, "test2_input": "TUGGER Emily? \nPIN Emily Kostich. Where she's at now. Says we'd want to know. Wants to meet. \nTUGGER (uncomfortable) Yeah? \nPIN So we'll meet him. Four o'clock. (to Brendan) Emily was Tug's girl for awhile. You know Emily, didn't you? BRENDAN A while back. \nPIN You've heard she's missing? \nBRENDAN Yeah, I heard that. \nPIN So maybe you want to come along too. \nBRENDAN What has Emily got to do with you? \nPIN (looks at Tugger) Show, maybe we'll find out. \nHe gives a slip of paper to Tugger. \nPIN (cont'd) Four o'clock. \nTugger glances at the slip, then slides it to Brendan. It has the symbol drawn in pencil: \nA horn honks outside. \nBRENDAN That's my ride. \nThe Pin calls after him as he leaves. \nPIN Four o'clock. \nEXT. FRONT OF PIN'S HOUSE - SAME \nBrendan falls into Laura's idling car. \nBRENDAN (roughly) A payphone, anywhere. \nLAURA What- \nBrendan throws the car into drive, and they jerk forward. \nEXT. STREET CORNER - DAY \nPAYPHONE The mobile customer you have called is away from the phone- \nBrendan slams the phone down violently and walks back towards the car. His legs quiver, and a coughing fit hits. \nHacking and spluttering he falls to his knees. Laura's arms wrap around him, except it isn't Laura, it's Emily. Brendan spins backwards into \nDARKNESS \nEmily kissing his mouth, her hair around him, but it isn't her hair, it's Laura's. Brendan shoots upwards \nINT. LAURA'S CAR STATIONARY - DAY \nand sits up with a jolt. Laid out in the back seat, Laura dabbing his head with a wet napkin. \nBRENDAN (barks shakily) What time is it? \nLAURA Lie down, Brendan- BRENDAN What time- \nLAURA You've got a fever, you've got to go to the hospital or- \nBRENDAN What time is it? \nLAURA Three forty. You've got to rest, you're feverish. \nHe throws himself out of the car. \nEXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - SAME \nBrendan falls to his knees, coughing. Laura follows. \nLAURA Get back in the car, I'm taking you home, you're sick, you need- \nBRENDAN Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! \n", "test2_true": "I'll be up on the, the blacktop, the basketball field. So you've got to go by you or me to get down there. If you see anyone but the Pin or Tugger or their crew go down into the ravine, honk four times, long short long short. But don't be seen. \nLAURA Get back in the car. \nBRENDAN Do it! Will you do it? I need you to do this. I need you, here. Please. \nHe holds her shoulders. A beat, then her face registers resignation. \nEXT. BASKETBALL FIELD - DAY \nA flat plane of pebbly asphalt with a dozen basketball courts faintly outlined across its surface. Brendan stands crooked, watching the barren horizon. The wind blows bitterly, and the sky is dark. \nThen, a speck. Coming towards Brendan, across the field. Brendan slumps towards it. Closer. Still a dark dot. Closer. \nBrendan's face snaps into recognition. \nBRENDAN What are you doing, Dode? \nDode grins. He holds a newspaper. \nDODE You gonna stop me? \nBRENDAN What do you think you're doing, Dode? DODE I saw you. I saw what you did. \nBRENDAN What'd you see? \nDODE I saw you. \nBRENDAN What'd you see me? \nDODE You were with her, dead, and you took the body. \nBRENDAN Yeah, I did. That's all you saw? What about before? \nDODE Before what? \nBRENDAN Did you see who killed her before I got there? \nDODE (face ashen) You killed her. \nBRENDAN I found the body, Dode. \nDODE You, I thought you didn't, but we figured out, I got the news on ya, cause you hid the body, why wouldn't- \nBRENDAN Who's 'we'? \nDODE Shut up! You're always talking, always this and that smartso, you're gonna shut up now! \nBRENDAN I didn't kill her, Dode. \nDODE You're not going to talk this! \nBRENDAN Dode, I know you're thinking of Em, I know you tried to help her- \nDODE Shut up! You're gonna shut your \nBrendan staggers, the world blurs out for a moment, then snaps back. DODE (cont'd) put it over real nice- \nBRENDAN -so I'm telling you now you're in over your head, you don't want to put your hand in this- \nDode shakes the newspaper at him. \nDODE Shut up! She's dead, you- \nBRENDAN Why was she scared, Dode? She came to me, who was she scared of? I think I know why, I just gotta know who! \nDode throws the paper, which scatters in the wind. DODE You're trying to confuse me. \nBRENDAN Dode. \nDODE You couldn't stand it. Your little Em. She was gonna keep it, it was mine, and you couldn't stand that. \nBRENDAN What was yours? \nDODE I had you pegged. \n", "test2_id": 2257, "test3_input": "TUGGER Hell I don't. BRENDAN The Pin's sitting on the brick profits - hitting him now would be post. Make peace and wait for your chance. \nLAURA He's right, Tug. Smooth it out. \nBRENDAN (between coughs) Besides, he's got you on the Dode thing. War'll mean you vs. him and every bull in the burgh. \nTugger turns away, thinking. \nTUGGER Yeah, we'll talk. \nLAURA (to Brendan) You going? \nBRENDAN Yeah. \nShe nods. Brendan stumbles into the bedroom. \nINT. TUGGER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBrendan lies on his back. Sweat stands on his forehead. \nTHE FAN \nSpinning dizzily from Brendan's POV. Then the fan is still and the room is spinning, then the fan, then the room. Brendan clamps his eyes shut. A door creaks open. \nBRENDAN (croaks) Go away. \nLaura floats across the room to him. Her hair falls around him. Brendan shrinks back. She puts a pale hand on his clammy forehead. Brendan tries to speak, but cannot. \nHe fingers slide over his face. She pulls off his glasses. \nHer hands all over his face. Brendan's throat contorts in a hard swallow. His eyes are wet. \nHer hair, her hands all warm and gentle, touching him. \nLAURA I'm sorry Brendan. \nBrendan breaks. In silent sobs first, then shivering with an almighty release he cries like a baby in her arms. \nTHE FAN \nSpinning above them. \nLaura lights a cigarette. They lie beside each other. \nLAURA Don't go tonight. \nBRENDAN I've got to make sure it plays out smooth. \nLAURA It'll play however it plays without you there. \nBRENDAN I've got to make sure. \nLAURA Why? BRENDAN Cause if there's war, I'm in it too. \nLAURA Well let's just, I mean why not just run away. Go somewhere. I've got a car. (Brendan gives a wry look) I've got an aunt in New Orleans, she wouldn't care. (Brendan grins) Yeah, it's a stupid thing, but think about it, why not? What, school? C'mon. Family? \nBRENDAN Alright, stop. \nHer smoke drifts into the fan. LAURA I wasn't serious, but we could go for awhile. Just until everything clears. \nBrendan watches the smoke. She stubs the butt out in an ash tray on the table and curls against his chest. \nStretching his arm across the table, he nonchalantly spins the ash tray around with his finger. \nHis glasses lay on the table. Through the left lens the cigarette is magnified. Pale blue arrow on the filter. \nLaura's arm stretches across his chest. He looks at it, then up at the fan, spinning. \nLATER \nBrendan slips out of bed. A glowing clock radio reads \nINT. TUGGER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nA swarm of silent activity. Tug's flunkies prepare various weapons. Brendan goes to Tug. \nBRENDAN Tell your boys no knuckle business. \n", "test3_true": "BRENDAN Your folks left a car here? TUGGER Yeah. \nBRENDAN Take it and Laura's. (Brendan tosses Tug the keys) I'll go first in yours. \nTUGGER The hell- \nBRENDAN I'll take the scenic route to draw off any tailers. They'll think it's you, they might even radio back that you're alone. Get it? \nTUGGER Mr. Smarts. \nHe tosses Brendan his keys. \nBRENDAN Alright. Got a cigarette? \nTUGGER No. I don't smoke. BRENDAN I've seen you smoke. \nTUGGER I don't smoke cigarettes. \nBRENDAN Give me fifteen minutes, then go. \nEXT. TUGGER'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nBrendan slides into the black mustang and gutters off into the night. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nOverlooking a twinkling valley of suburban lights. Brendan talks at a payphone beside the curbed mustang. \nTHE BRAIN (on phone) Yeah. \nBRENDAN Alright, I warned you. Can you get the car? \nTHE BRAIN Yeah. \nBRENDAN Go to 2014 Clancy, off Pico west of La Grange. Park outside and wait. Laura's inside. She hasn't got a car, but if she blows on foot or gets a pick, tail her. Alright? (silence) Alright? \nTHE BRAIN Okay. BRENDAN I'll call you when it gets light. (silence) Thanks, Brain. \nCLICK, Brain hangs up. \nEXT. FRONT OF PIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nBrendan pulls the mustang into the driveway, limps up to the front door and knocks. One of the Pin's boys lets him in. \nINT. KITCHEN - SAME \nCrowded with tense looking punks, half dressed like the Pin and half like Tugger. The Pin's mom is shuffling about, pouring them milk. \nINT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME \nSeveral more punks from both camps crowd the hall, and more lean in the darkened doorways. Brendan passes through quickly. \nINT. PIN'S DEN - SAME \nThe Pin at his desk, flanked by two of his boys. Tug sits in the center of the room, two of his punks beside him. Brendan saunters between them and leans against the dresser. \nBRENDAN Talk. PIN I want full assurance that any heat from Emily and Dode is gonna be on just you. I don't even want my name pulled in the shindig. Second, you owe me six Cs, no rush, but I want your shake that it'll come home in not too much time. \nTug's eyes burn, his scar reddens. \nBRENDAN (to Tug) That's square. You did them after all. Lay low it'll blow over. Stick on this, one of you'll dish it to bury the other and you'll both get the rap. As to the six, did you borrow it? \nTUGGER Yeah. \nBRENDAN Then you owe it. Shouldn't need a shake on that. \nTug looks at the Pin. \nTUGGER Alright to both. \nBRENDAN Good. Let's seal it up and blow for keeps. \nPIN Third thing. The last brick. \nBrendan looks up sharply, taken off guard. \n", "test3_id": 2258}

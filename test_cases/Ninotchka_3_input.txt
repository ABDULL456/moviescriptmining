IRANOFF They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor. 
KOPALSKI While you eat, you look at the view. 
CLOSE-UP -- NINOTCHKA 
She is trying to overcome all sentimentality, but as the following speech progresses she cannot escape the personal implication involved. 
NINOTCHKA Yes, it is an amazing piece of engineering. Still the most remarkable iron structure in the world. Leading to the top there is a staircase of over a thousand steps... but an elevator is included in the price of admission.

FADE IN: 
INSERT OF A PARIS NEWSPAPER 
HERALD DU MATIN 
Camera zooms down on a headline of an article. 
Mercier buys priceless russian jewels. Russian commission has left for moscow. 
STREET IN PARIS -- MORNING 
Camera follows Leon as he walks excitedly and nervously along the boulevard. He turns into a Russian Intouriste Bureau, one of the travel bureaus maintained by the Soviet government in foreign countries to supply information regarding travel, give visas, etc. 
INTOURISTE BUREAU 
It is a typical travel bureau. Behind the counter are attendants and some people getting information and pamphlets. Leon enters, looks around, and sees a door which says "Visas and Passport Department." He enters. 
INTERIOR, VISA ROOM 
It is a room smaller than the previous one. Behind the counter stands a typical Bolshevik Official. In front of the counter is an elderly English lady. Leon takes his place behind her, nervous at having to wait. The Official stamps the English lady's passport and hands it to her. 
OFFICIAL Well, everything is in order. I hope you will enjoy your trip to Russia, madame. 
ENGLISH LADY Thank you. Oh, by the way, I've heard so many rumors about laundry conditions in Russia. Is it advisable to take one's own towels? 
OFFICIAL Certainly not, madame. That's only capitalistic propaganda. We change the towel every week. 
ENGLISH LADY Oh... thank you. 
She leaves. Leon moves up to the Official. 
OFFICIAL Yes, please? 
At this moment the telephone rings. The Official takes the receiver. 
OFFICIAL (into phone) Yes... Comrade Cazabine? No, I'm sorry... he hasn't been with us for six months. He was called back to Russia and was investigated. You can get further details from his widow. 
He hangs up the receiver. Leon, thinking of Ninotchka, is horrified by this statement. 
LEON Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way? 
OFFICIAL Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. (he knocks on wood) 
LEON (his alarm growing) Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately. 
OFFICIAL (reading passport) Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman! 
LEON Don't hold that against me... please! 
OFFICIAL Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia? 
LEON Business. 
OFFICIAL What business? 
LEON Private. 
OFFICIAL There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess! 
LEON (dismayed) Confess what? 
OFFICIAL Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians? 
LEON On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them. 
OFFICIAL You believe in our cause? 
Leon, feeling that he has to go to the rescue of his girl, whips up an enormous enthusiasm for the cause. 
LEON Oh... I think it's great! Everyone works -- everyone contributes -- that's what I want to do -- work! I make my own bed -- you can call up my butler! I don't believe in the right of the individual. I like the Bolshevik ideal -- everyone being the same. You just like me -- me just like you -- I use your comb -- you use my toothbrush -- oh, it's a great life.... Please... give me that visa! 
At this moment Swana enters. 
SWANA Hello, Leon darling! 
LEON (startled) Hello. 
SWANA (suavely) After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you. (to the Official) May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.

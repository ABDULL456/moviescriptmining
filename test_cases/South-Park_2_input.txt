ANGLE - TELEVISION - THE CONAN O'BRIAN SHOW 
Conan comes back from a commercial break. Sitting next to him, is Ms. Brooke Shields. 
CONAN O'BRIAN Our next guests have the number one movie in the world right now, please welcome Terrance and Phillip! 
A few cheers as Terrance and Phillip walk out on stage. A few boos as well, and we see that the South Park mothers are in the audience holding 'Anti-Terrance and Phillip' signs. 
Terrance and Phillip walk out and sit next to Brooke Shields. 
PHILLIP Hello, Conan! 
TERRANCE Hello, Brooke Shields! 
CONAN It's nice to have you here in America. 
PHILLIP Yeah, well, you being a Canadian and all, we thought what the hell! 
CONAN O'BRIAN So guys... I understand you have a comedy routine worked out for us. 
PHILLIP We sure do, Conan. And here it is. Excuse me, Terrance. 
TERRANCE Yes, Phillip? 
Phillip rips a fart that launches Terrance backwards and into the band.  They both laugh wildly. 
PHILLIP Gotcha! 
Terrance and Phillip laugh. Nobody in the audience laughs. 
ANGLE - BOYS 
They laugh merrily. 
RESUME - THE CONAN O'BRIAN SHOW 
TERRANCE Good one, Phillip!  Cheers. 
PHILLIP Cheers, Terrance! 
Terrance extricates himself from the band. Conan is growing nervous. He looks out into the audience... 
Kyle's mother is sitting there, looking angry. Conan makes eye contact with her, and then nods his head. Kyle's mother nods back. 
CONAN O'BRIAN (Nervous) So, guys, I need to ask you a serious question... 
PHILLIP I just farted Terrance back into the stone age! 
They both laugh hard. 
Brooke Shields waits a beat, then belts out a fake laugh. 
BROOKE SHIELDS I farted once on the set of Blue Lagoon! 
TERRANCE Nobody cares, Brooke Shields! 
CONAN O'BRIAN Terrance and Phillip... Whose idea was it, to have a person lighting a fart on fire in your movie? Who is responsible for that? 
Terrance and Phillip exhange glances. 
TERRANCE Phillip, I think our friend Conan has been working too hard. 
CONAN O'BRIAN Say it! It was YOUR idea to have someone light a fart on fire in your movie! 
PHILLIP/TERRANCE (Together) It was our idea to have someone light a fart on fire in your movie. 
ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE 
Kyle's mother is among them, listening to all this. 
KYLE'S MOTHER (Into her lapel) That's it!  Move, move, move! 
ANGLE ON TERRANCE AND PHILLIP 
A battalion of Army guys appear, seize Terrance and Phillip and arrest everyone in their group. 
KYLE'S MOTHER Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU! 
ANGLE - BOYS 
KYLE Dude, what the hell is going on? 
RESUME - THE CONAN O'BRIAN SHOW 
TERRANCE Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!! 
PHILLIP This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us! (Pointing to Conan) You are a bad man! 
TERRANCE And you call yourself a Canadian! (To Phillip) I told you we should of done Leno! 
Conan O'Brian turns away, ashamed. 
KYLE'S MOTHER Don't listen to them, Mr. O'Brian. They're master manipulators. You did a good job. 
TERRANCE You loved our movie, Conan!  We watched it together.  You... You laughed! 
Conan grabs his head. 
CONAN O'BRIAN What have I done?!!! 
Conan grabs a gun and blows his head off, dousing Brooke Shields with blood. 
BROOKE SHIELDS AGAHGAHGGH!!!! Mondays at eight AAAGHGH!!!! 
Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily. Kyle's mother cradles Conan's lifeless body.

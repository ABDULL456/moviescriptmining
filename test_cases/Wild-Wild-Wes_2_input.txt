WEST (still pissed, to Gordon) Hang'm!?! 
GORDON (to Rita) Meet my trigger-happy partner, James West... who doesn't seem to realize that my carefully planned diversion gave me the opportunity to search for the missing scientists. 
Now West notices the half-dressed bombshell in the carriage. 
WEST Scientist, huh. 
GORDON This is Rita. I found her locked in a cage in Loveless's bedroom. She's an entertainer. 
RITA Um, maybe I haven't been quite honest about that... My name is Rita Escobar. I came to find Guillermo Escobar, the scientist, my... father. 
Gordon's eyes pop. 
GORDON Professor Escobar?! He was the one I almost rescued that night when... (lightbulb) That's where I know you from! Fat-Can Candy's... you sang before I did. 
RITA Excuse me? 
(CONTINUED) 
THE WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 6/15/98                         50. 
68   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               68 
GORDON That was me. Burgundy dress with the bustle... 
Gordon starts singing the song... West rolls his eyes, cuts off the chit-chat. 
WEST Look, Rita, I'm sorry you had the wrong agent working on your case. When I find your father I promise I'll send him back safely... 
And with that... West suddenly leaps over Rita -- lands on the back of one of the horses. He grabs a handful of mane, leans over and unclips the harness. And with a kick in the ribs, West is off at a gallop -- leaving Gordon, one remaining horse and an awed Rita behind to chew his dust. 
RITA He's impulsive, James. 
69   EXT. OFFSHORE - LOVELESS BOAT - NIGHT                           69 
Dr. Loveless and his visiting foreign dignitaries are sipping champagne. One of them is holding a little DOG in his arms, BARKING at something in the dark. General McGrath stands at the railing, uncharacteristically pensive. Loveless rolls over, hands him a glass of champagne. 
LOVELESS Well, General, it's been a long journey from New Liberty. 
McGrath visibly winces at the sound of it. 
McGRATH Sir, there isn't a day that passes that I don't contemplate it. 
LOVELESS Yes, and so do I. So do I. (reflexively reaches for missing legs) If I'd only had the scientific understanding of gunpowder and primers that I have today... 
(CONTINUED) 
69   CONTINUED:                                                  69 
McGRATH That's not what I meant. 
Loveless looks at him, puzzled, then gets it. 
LOVELESS Oh, you mean the stomach-churning carnage that earned you your unfortunate nom de guerre... 
Loveless speaks for the benefit of the others. 
LOVELESS What was that nickname again? 
McGRATH (reluctantly) 'Bloodbath' McGrath... the Butcher of New Liberty.' 
70   EXT. MALHEUREUX POINT - MARSH - NIGHT                       70 
A reb battalion waits in a foggy meadow that slopes down to marsh. Beyond that is the Gulf of Mexico. We recognize one of the REBS from the cathouse. He opens his pocket watch. 
REB #1 They oughta be here by now. 
REB #2 Maybe we're in the wrong place. 
REB #1 (rechecks map) No, we're supposed to wait 'xactly on this here spot. 
Suddenly they hear a CLANKING and SCREECHING coming from the marsh. They ready their arms and get in defensive positions. What they can't see through the fog is... 
ANGLE - MARSH - ARMORED TANK 
amphibiously sludges up through the mud and reeds, passing by the dumbstruck soldiers as it heads to the center of the field. The contraption has a large cannon and Gatling guns bristling from several ports. The Rebs cheer their new weapon. 
THE WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 7/1/98                         52. 
71   EXT. MALHEUREUX POINT - BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT                    71 
Now a MORTAR appears through the turret and FIRES a ROCKET that EXPLODES over the Reb soldiers, illuminating the field. As soldiers shield their eyes from the blinding light... 
ANGLE - AERIAL SHOT - LOOKING DOWN ON FIELD 
Unbeknownst to the Rebs, Loveless has mowed and stained the field with concentric lines to give it a giant dart board appearance. 
Suddenly the TANK TURRET OPENS FIRE on them. Once over their initial shock, the Rebs FIRE BACK with their Springfield RIFLES. But the BULLETS PING off the tank's impenetrable skin like goober peas. 
72   EXT. OFFSHORE - LOVELESS BOAT - NIGHT                          72 
Lippenreider is viewing the carnage through large binoculars on a stand. 
General McGrath turns from the rail and faces Loveless, outraged. 
McGRATH Why you sawed-off sadistic bastard! You've betrayed us! 
Loveless turns to him, cocks his head. 
LOVELESS My dear General, after donating half my physical being creating a weapon capable of doing this... how did you and General Lee repay my loyalty? You surrendered at Appomattox! So, who betrayed whom? 
Loveless turns to Munitia holding a steno pad.

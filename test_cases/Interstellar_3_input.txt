Brand is pulling herself up. Behind her, the THUNDEROUS EXPLOSIONS as a strip of the planet's surface is hurled into space have almost reached them. 
Cooper looks at the ship. He'll never make it if he waits for Brand. He turns back to find her. 
He reaches Brand just as the moon's gravity hits them -- they're hurtled off into space. He grabs her hand. 
Seconds later, everything -- the entire ice sheet, the sea and rocks deep below -- is hurled up after them. 
Brand and Cooper embrace as they rocket up through the thin atmosphere. 
Brand looks at him. 
BRAND (RADIO) You caught me. Now what? 
Cooper looks around. They planet's surface is breaking into pieces around them. 
COOPER (RADIO) I don't know. (RADIO) I figured if you were floating out into space, you'd want some company. 
He holds onto her as they fall up and out of the last of the planet's thin atmosphere and the blackness embraces them. 
BRAND Between you and utter solitude, Cooper, frankly, I'm not sure. 
They reach the apex of their climb and the gravity of the planet begins to win out. For a moment they float. 
COOPER Guess you were right -- too much gravity, or not enough. 
He smiles, forgetting their predicament for a moment. They stare into each other's eyes. 
Then they begin, very gently, to fall back towards the ice planet. 
Suddenly, the lander maneuvers beneath them. The airlock opens to catch them -- Doyle is at the helm. 
Brand and Cooper pull themselves aboard. 
INT. LANDER 
Cooper closes the door and Doyle rotates the lander outwards. 
Doyle FIRES the engines and the lander continues ascending into space as the debris around them begins crashing back down towards the ice planet. 
Cooper looks out the window: 
The moon continues tearing up a massive canyon in the planet's surface as it circles out of view. 
COOPER Roth. 
BRAND He's gone. 
Ahead, a shadow looms in the darkness: the Endurance. 
INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE 
Brand, Cooper, and Doyle pull themselves out of the airlock and scramble to take control of the ship. 
Below them, the surface of the ice planet illuminates as the neutron star's x-rays begin to reach it from the far side of Pantagruel. 
Doyle finally gets the ship straightened out. Its sole remaining engine FIRES, rocketing the ship back towards the dark side of the planet, out of view of the neutron star, and back towards the original wormhole. 
DOYLE I'm setting a course for the wormhole. 
They're going to make it. 
Cooper and Brand make eye contact -- Brand gives him a tiny awkward smile. He returns it, then descends below. 
INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE 
Cooper props Case up against the workbench. He pulls down replacement arms and legs from storage bins. Unwraps them from their vacuum sealed plastic and bolts them back onto Case's chassis. 
Cooper finishes attaching the arm. Case rotates it, checking the function. 
COOPER How is that working? 
CASE Very well, thank you. 
COOPER Good. We've already set the course, skipper. We're going home. 
Cooper hauls himself back up into the observation level. 
INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL 
Doyle is setting the controls. The ALARMS on the controls have finally abated -- they're out of the danger zone. 
BRAND We're safe now. 
Cooper heads to the communications equipment. 
COOPER Now I know why we weren't able to hit the relay. It's not interference -- the blue-shift from the black hole is more than we thought it would be. 
Cooper begins re-calibrating the equipment. 
BRAND (CONFLICTED) Cooper, wait-- 
The ship PINGS the relay on the far side of the wormhole. 
There is no response. 
COOPER Nothing. (THINKS) Wait. The ship cached one long garbled transmission when we first fell into the swirl. If we account for the blue shift then the computer might find something in there. 
Cooper brings up the last garbled transmission they received. The computer begins re-analyzing it, piece by piece. 
BRAND (QUIET) Listen to me -- the blueshift also means we've lost time. More time than we thought we would. 
Cooper looks up at her. 
COOPER How much? 
BRAND A lot... Cooper, maybe it's best if WE DON'T- 
The comms equipment TONES as it translates a packet. Then another. 
Then a FLOOD of communications, one packet a day, hundreds and hundreds of packets: images, videos, audio messages from family and friends. 
Cooper watches, horrified, as the images play out across the screen. He is watching the lives of his family play out at light speed. Finally, the packets slow, then stop. 
Cooper looks at the results, in shock. 
COOPER Forty seven years. 
Doyle joins him, staring at the screen, stunned. 
DOYLE My kids... 
Cooper tries to PING the relay again. Nothing comes back.

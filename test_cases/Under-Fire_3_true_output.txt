Price holds up his hands -- he may be fearless, but he's not stupid. The soldier pulls a knife, then pulls his own tongue from his mouth, and makes motions with the knife as if cutting out his tongue. The message is clear -- Price doesn't speak. 
The soldier walks up to the Waiter and points. The Waiter is frightened. 
Through the shadows we see an officer talking with a civilian in a hat. The civilian points to a door. 
THE WAITER IS LED AWAY THROUGH A DOOR protesting desperately as he goes. The soldier moves to the next prisoner -- he too is led away. This repeats itself until the soldier arrives at price. 
THE SOLDIER POINTS TO PRICE 
PRICE'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE SHADOWS The civilian is in a discussion with the officer -- it is clear that his opinion affects the decisions. For a moment Price doesn't know where he's going to be led. The civilian points to a different door -- it opens -- and Price steps down off the display rack into a room. 
THROUGH THE DOOR as Price steps through, the action continues with the other Nicaraguan prisoners. Price looks around quickly, but the Civilian and Officer are gone. He is quickly shown into a bare office. 
INT. THE BARE ROOM 
Pictures on the wall of Somoza and the FLAG RAISING AT IWO JIMA. Price's cameras and bag sit on a desk. 
P.O.V. THE CIVILIAN THROUGH A DOOR -- IT IS MARCEL JAZY His rumpled elegance is at odds with the brutal surroundings. The door closes. 
A SENIOR OFFICER ENTERS THE BARE ROOM, and Price addresses him at once. 
PRICE Soy un periodista. 
SENIOR GUARD OFFICER (in excellent English) Mr. Price... you must accept our deepest apologies for the misunderstanding. Somebody saw you taking photographs of terrorists hooligans in the parade and at the nightclub -- our young officers get carried away... they're always looking for traitors. 
PRICE That film is half way to New York by now. 
SENIOR GUARD OFFICER I know, I know... It was all a misunderstanding... una mala interpretacion. Your cameras. 
The Officer reaches for one of Price's cameras and hands it to him, but as he does: 
THE CAMERA DROPS TO THE GROUND AND BREAKS -- SILENCE The Officer would love for Price to get angry. 
SENIOR GUARD OFFICER I'm sorry. 
Price smiles barely, and refuses to pop off. 
PRICE Forget it. 
Price puts his cameras in his bag, and as he is shown from the room he notices a copy of the TIME MAGAZINE WITH ELEPHANT sitting on the desk. 
SENIOR GUARD OFFICER This way. 
Price is shown to a door, handed over to a soldier, and led outside into the night. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. MILITARY PRISON - DAWN 
Claire stands at the main doorway surrounded by GUARDS, an OFFICER, and an unidentified CIVILIAN -- she is arguing with them in rapid Spanish, not allowing them to get in a word. 
CLAIRE (in Spanish) You throw a journalist in jail -- it gets in the papers. You walk all over the same press credentials you pass out. I demand to speak to someone in authority or I'll go to Tacho myself... I don't understand you -- you're big and strong and handsome but you're not so smart! (beat) You should be trying to seduce us! 
OFFICER Senora... 
PRICE IS SHOWN OUT A DOOR IN THE BACKGROUND and sees her. 
PRICE Claire! 
They hurry toward each other and embrace briefly. The Guards watch it all curiously. 
CLAIRE You're okay? 
PRICE I'm fine -- what're you doing here? These guys are goons. 
CLAIRE They love being beaten up by a woman (beat) I've been looking for you all night -- why'd they lock you up? 
They walk away together. 
PRICE I don't know. Taking pictures. The usual. Jazy got me released. 
CLAIRE Jazy?! You think there's a story there? 
PRICE Ahh... C.I.A. stories are all alike. I wanta find Rafael. 
CLAIRE You need help? 
PRICE No. You? 
CLAIRE No. (beat) When should we start. 
PRICE I figure you probably want to do a little research on the history of Marcel Jazy's business connections in the third world countries with C.I.A. influence... 
CLAIRE Oh. I assumed you'd just look him in the eye and say "Gimme a break, for crissakes, Marcel, are you a spy or aren't you?" 
CUT TO: 
EXT. GARDEN COURTYARD OF MARCEL JAZY - DAY LATER

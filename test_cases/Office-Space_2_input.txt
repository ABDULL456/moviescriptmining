SAMIR That's right. 
MICHAEL They don't understand. I could come up with a program that could rip that place off big timeÂ…big time. 
PETER Yeah. 
Cut to Joanna, a pretty waitress. 
Cut back to the guys. 
PETER Oh, there she is. 
SAMIR Peter, you, you always talk about this girl. If you're so obsessed with her, why don't you just ask her out? 
PETER Because I'm just another asshole customer. You can't just walk up to a waitress and ask her out. (cut to Joanna, and back to them) Plus, I'm still trying to work it out with Anne. Oh, that reminds me. I'm not going to be able to play poker with you guys on Friday. 
MICHAEL Why not? 
PETER Uh, I have to see this occupational hypnotherapist with Anne. 
MICHAEL Dude! An occupational hypnotherapist?! 
PETER Anne wants me to go. She thinks it might help. Y'know, sometimes I just think, I keep thinking that she's cheating on me. 
MICHAEL Yeah. I know what you mean. 
SAMIR Yeah. 
PETER What is that supposed to mean? 
MICHAEL Nothing. Why don't you just tell Anne you're not into hypnosis and you want to play poker with us? 
PETER Ah, I can't do that. She might get all pissed off at me. Besides, I think the guy might be able to help. He did help Anne lose weight. 
SAMIR Peter, she's anorexic. 
PETER Yeah, I know. The guy's really good. 
MICHAEL An occupational hypnotherapist isn't going to help you solve any of your problems. And speaking of problems, what's this I hear about you having problems with your TPS reports? 
SAMIR Yeah. Didn't you get that memo? 
Peter sighs.

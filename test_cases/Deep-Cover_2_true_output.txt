Hull pressing the phone to his face, trying to master his emotions. 
GRAINY 16MM FILM - A LABORATORY MAZE 
A lab rat with a metal electrode protruding from its head, is running a maze at high speed. A VOICE explaining things. 
VOICE (young, nasal, too smart) The maze leads in two directions. At one end the rat can obtain a food pellet. At the other... (pointer indicates each end) ...it receives electrical stimulus to a very specific area of the cerebellum... 
The rat reaches this second destination, pushes a bar, is stimulated. A lab worker (white coat, gloves) picks up the animal, replaces it at the start. It runs the same route. 
VOICE (continuing) This rat, like 86% of the others in the experiment, chose the electrical stimulus repeatedly and exclusively. It continued to do so until it died of malnutrition. 
ANOTHER SHOT -- the rat dead. 
INT. A LABORATORY - DAY OR NIGHT 
A 21-year-old RENEGADE from the Cal Tech chemistry department (red hair, freckles, glasses held together with electrical tape), a brilliant nerd. He picks up... 
A MOLECULAR MODEL 
Colored balls stuck together with wooden dowels. 
CAL TECH This is an addictive amphetamine with time-space distortion, delusions of grandeur -- or maybe they're real -- tending to be impulsive, sometimes violent behavior. Psychotropic adaptation for late monopoly capitalism. It's illegal, and you can buy it on any street corner. 
He tears off some of the balls, sticks on new ones. 
CAL TECH (continuing) This increases energy, attention, cognitive powers, yet with a smooth, almost opiate-like emotional surface. Ideal for the post-political, post- rationalist global marketplace and 24 hour lifestyles. It's completely legal and can only get it here, in my lab. 
ELIAS (to Hull, proudly) Randy's a genius. His professor told him he could win the Nobel prize. 
CAL TECH Nobel prizes are for wussies. 
HULL What does this shit do to you? 
CAL TECH I'm on it now. It's like cocaine only better. (offers him powder on a slide) Want some? 
HULL I don't take drugs. 
CAL TECH (unoffended) Your mistake. This is designed for the top end of the market. For people who want to master reality, not avoid it. Because it's synthetic, you don't grow it, refine it, or -- best of all -- import it. 
ELIAS What would it take to manufacture this stuff in quantity? 
CAL TECH With a million dollars, I could produce enough for a limited market at about two bucks a pop. (makes a face: fair) But then with five million, or better yet ten, the cost would drop to thirty cents, and we'd have enough for the whole world. 
ELIAS I'm going to put two hundred fifty thousand into your corporate account. You cheat me, Randy, I'll use your bladder for a bagpipe. (to Hull, with a vengeance) We're going to put Barbosa out of business. 
Elias is very happy. He leads Hull out. 
INT. CARVER'S OFFICE - DAY 
On the pyramid chart there's a black border around Ivy's photo, as around Eddie's. A photo of Hull is now on the board beside the one of Elias. Hull stares out the window, lost in thought. 
CARVER (dismissive) Synthetic shit?? Sounds like a 20/20 segment... 
Hull shrugs: it's not that important. Carver turns to his real interest. 
CARVER (continuing) So, what was it like? 
HULL (still looking out) What was what like? 
CARVER Popping Ivy... 
HULL You knew. 
CARVER I'm God, remember? 
HULL (looks back out) Then you should know how it was. 
Carver smiles, but he's non-plussed by Hull's new detachment. 
CARVER You didn't clear it with me. You're getting independent. That's good. 
Hull smiles. 
CARVER (continuing) How're we coming on Gallegos?

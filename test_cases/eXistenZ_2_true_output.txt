We melt back up into the church, which we last saw in the first scene. But there are many differences between then and now, Geller is sitting in her chair on the dais as before, her eyes just beginning to flutter open. But Pikul is sitting next to her, also playing the game. And next to him is Nourish, whom we are even more surprised to see in this context. Aad in fact, the players who are sitting in the circle of chairs on the dais are all characters who have been in the movie up to this point: Nader, the cashier, Dichter, Gas, Vinkokur, even Frances, the limo driver. The players are all emerging from a game that has just ended - the movie we have been watching - and they begin to stir in their game gear, which is nothing like the organic pod- technology we have just seen. On the contrary, the garners are wearing head-gear with electrodes, more like normal clunky Virtual-Reality equipment, and are linked by mundane wires. In their laps they hold, not game-pods, but sleek plastic game modules, each about the size of a walkman, with holes into Which I their left thumbs are inserted - a simpler and cruder version of the bioports we have become used to. 
Watching the proceedings from down on the church floor are two security guards, neither of whom is Pikul, of course. On a leash, one of the security guards holds the dog that, in the game, picked up the gristle gun in the Chinese restaurant. Also monitoring the action are a woman, Merle, who is the game's actual project manager - the real-life version of the game-character Levi - and her two assistants. There is a collective sigh as the game finally releases the players, and now they are free to remove their thumbs from the game modules and slide their head-gear off. The two assistants - the real-life ones are both matronly women - begin to help everyone unplug, neatly gathering up the equipment in padded bags as they go. A broadly smiling Merle mounts the dais and stands in the centre of the ring of players. 
MERLE Are you all back? The man whom we knew in the game as Yevgeny Nourish immediately stands and takes charge. But it is a different Nourish, exuberant, sensitive and artistic. 
NOURISH We're back, Merle. Although I have a feeling some of our crew might not realize it yet. Shaky laughter from some of the players. Throughout the following round of comments from the garners, whom we now realize have been, up to now, playing characters in a game, we hear nothing from Pikul and Geller. These two, who sit next to each other and are now holding hands, remain enigmatically silent. 
WAITER Wow. Anybody here want a bowl of hot and sour soup? 
(LAUGHTER) 
VINOKUR I will, if you make sure there 
R are some insect boards in the 
F( rice. 
(LAUGHTER) 
FEMALE ASSISTANT How long were we gone? 
MERLE About twenty minutes. 
T 
DICHTER It seemed like days. That's fantastic. 
FEMALE ASSISTANT Yeah. If you stayed in the gameworld for most of your life, you could live to be five hundred years old! 
(LAUGHTER) 
CASHIER The twists and turns at the end made my head spin. Maybe there were too many, to fast to absorb. (to Pikul and Geller) Hey, but you two were fantastic. You guys are game divas! I think you both deserved to win. There is general agreement amongst the garners about this compliment to Pikul and Geller. The pair just smile sweetly and bob their heads modestly at the smattering of applause. 
GAS (a little jealous) Well me, I was really bummed out at first. I got knocked out of the game so soon. It was fun to watch the rest, though. I liked that part where the ones who got knocked out of the game early got to be spooky customers in the game store. 
LEVI But you were so wonderfully bad. So scary and crazy. I had a lot to do in that first scene in the church but I thought my character was kind of boring. 
GAS Well, you know, I'm a gas-jockey in real life, so I was kind of disappointed that I was basically the same thing in the game. A little more fantasy, there, fellers. 
Y{ 
MERLE 
(NODDING SAGELY) Interesting. Interesting. Hold that thought for the focus group. 
FRANCES (indicating game module) Can I keep this? I've never felt anything like it! And I love this little thumb-hole. It's fantastic! (appreciative laughs and 
APPLAUSE)
